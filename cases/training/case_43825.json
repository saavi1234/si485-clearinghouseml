    "summary": "<p style=\"text-align: left;\">On March 14, 2016, four individual plaintiffs filed a suit against the Texas Secretary of State and the Director of the Texas Department of Public Safety (&ldquo;DPS&rdquo;), seeking declaratory and injunctive relief to redress defendants&rsquo; alleged systemic and ongoing violations of the &ldquo;motor voter&rdquo; provisions of the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 (&ldquo;NVRA&rdquo;). The plaintiffs also alleged that the defendants&rsquo; conduct violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment due to alleged disparate treatment and arbitrary restrictions on the right to vote. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The main purpose of the NVRA is to increase the registration of eligible voters. The NVRA requires eligible voters to be registered to vote &ldquo;simultaneously&rdquo; with the submission of any driver&rsquo;s license application, renewal, or change-of-address form. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The plaintiffs claimed that unlike defendants&rsquo; simultaneous voter registration services for license renewal or address update applications submitted in-person at a DPS office, the defendants did not provide for simultaneous voter registration at any point during the online license renewal or address update process. Instead, the voters were directed to another website where they were notified to download or request a physical voter registration form. In order to register to vote, the voter would have to complete a separate voter registration form and then mail the form to the appropriate county registrar before the voter registration deadline.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Represented by private attorneys and the Texas Civil Rights Project, the plaintiffs sought declaratory relief under 28 U.S.C. &sect; 2201, and injunctive relief. Specifically, they sought to enjoin the defendants (including their agents and successors in office, and all individuals working in concert with them) from implementing practices and procedures that violate the NVRA. Further, the plaintiffs requested the court to direct defendants to take appropriate measures necessary to remedy the harm caused by their noncompliance. The case was filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas, San Antonio Division and assigned to Judge Orlando Garcia.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">On May 10, 2018, the District Court granted plaintiffs&rsquo; motion for summary judgment. The District Court stated that the requirements in the NVRA clearly apply to online transactions (e.g., electronic, remote, or internet transactions). The District Court further stated that numerous courts have determined that the NVRA requirements applies to online or remote transactions in the same manner it applies to in-person and mail transactions. The District Court reasoned that the NVRA requires DPS to provide a simultaneous application, not a simultaneous opportunity to undergo a second duplicate application process. The District Court determined that DPS is legally obligated to provide a simultaneous voter registration application with every transaction. The District Court found that the defendants violated the NVRA and the Equal Protection Clause. Therefore, the District Court entered a final judgment granting plaintiffs declaratory and injunctive relief. The District Court permanently enjoined defendants from continuing to violate the NVRA and Equal Protection Clause, and ordered them to establish procedures that treat each online driver's license renewal or change-of-address application as a simultaneous application for voter registration, which must then be submitted to the Secretary of State.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">On November 13, 2019, the defendants appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. The Fifth Circuit held that the plaintiffs did not have standing to seek declaratory and injunctive relief because they had not shown a continuing or threatened future injury to their right to vote. Therefore, the Fifth Circuit reversed the judgment of the District Court and vacated the District Court&rsquo;s injunction. The case was remanded to the District Court with instructions to dismiss plaintiffs&rsquo; claims for lack of standing.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">On January 17, 2020, the plaintiffs filed an emergency application for preliminary injunction and request for hearing. The District Court stated that although the Fifth Circuit found that the plaintiffs had not proven they would likely sustain another injury in the future, the injury has happened again. The plaintiffs visited the DPS website to change their address and were not offered a simultaneous application for voter registration. If these registrations were not updated before February 3, 2020, the plaintiffs would not have been able to vote in the March 2020 primary election. The District Court stated that it had revisited the issue and reached the same conclusion as it did in May 2018. The District Court found that the defendants violated the NVRA because plaintiffs were denied the right to simultaneously update their voter registration when they updated their address on the DPS website. The District Court reasoned that the provisions of the NVRA did not incorporate Texas election law and was not subject to it, Texas election law must yield to the NVRA, and there was nothing in either the NVRA or state law that prevented the use of electronic signatures in online driver's license-voter registration transactions. Therefore, the District Court determined there was a substantial likelihood that the plaintiffs would succeed on the merits of their NVRA claims. The District Court also determined that the plaintiffs had met the other elements of the preliminary injunction and granted partial injunctive relief. The District Court ordered that the defendants must immediately register the plaintiffs to vote and must confirm that the plaintiffs are registered to vote before the deadline to register to vote so they may participate in the upcoming primary elections.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">On August 28, 2020, the District Court granted the remainder of the request for preliminary injunctive relief. The District Court ordered the defendants to immediately take all the remaining steps necessary to come into compliance with NVRA by establishing a DPS System that treats each online driver's license renewal or change-of-address application as a simultaneous application for voter registration. The Defendants were ordered to complete this process and make the DPS system fully operable for public use by September 23, 2020.</p>",

Both sides had the opportunity to present live witnesses but declined. Plaintiffs, \nPlaintiff-Intervenors, and Defendants all presented oral argument on the applicable law and the current \nfacts set forth in the evidence attached to their motion, response, and reply.

Unless stated otherwise, all docket references are to the docket in 1 6-CV-257. \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 46   Filed 01/30/20   Page 2 of 17\nthe parties' arguments and reviewing the facts and applicable law, the Court finds that the Emergency \nApplication for Preliminary Injunction should be GRANTED in part, and the rest of the relief sought \ntherein will be held in abeyance. \nI. \nStandard and process of review \nTo obtain a preliminary injunction, movants must establish each of the following four factors: \n(1) a substantial likelihood of success on the merits; \n(2) a substantial threat of irreparable injury if the injunction is not issued; \n(3) the threatened injury if the injunction is denied outweighs any harm that will result if the \ninjunction is granted; and \n(4) granting an injunction will not disserve the public interest. \nTexas v. United States, 809 F.3d 134, 150 (5th Cir. 2015). In many cases, a preliminary injunction serves \nto preserve the relative positions of the parties until a trial on the merits can be held. Univ. of Texas v. \nCamenisch, 451 U.S. 390, 395 (1981). Preliminary injunctions that would change, rather than maintain, \nthe status quo are generally disfavored and should not issue unless the facts and law clearly favor the \nmoving party.  Martine< v. Mathews,  544 F.2d 1233, 1243  (5th Cir.  1976). On the other hand, \"[a] \nfundamental principle of preliminary injunctions [is that] [a]n injunction is of no help if one must wait \nto suffer injury before the court grants it.\" Texas v.  U.S., 809 F.3d at 173 n. 137 (citing United States v. \nEmerson, 270 F.3d 203, 262 (5th Cir. 2001)). In this case, maintaining the status quo would mean the \nindividual plaintiffs would remain unregistered and ineligible to vote in the county and precinct where \nthey reside. The Court need not wait for the individual plaintiffs to suffer disenfranchisement before \nconsidering preliminary injunctive relief. Id. Given the limited purpose of a preliminary injunction, and \ngiven the haste that is often necessary in considering the relief being sought, \"a preliminary injunction \nis customarily granted on the basis of procedures that are less formal and evidence that is less complete \n2 \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 46   Filed 01/30/20   Page 3 of 17\n3953 \nthan in a trial on the merits.\" Camenisob, 451 U.S. at  Ultimately, the decision to grant preliminary \ninjunctive relief rests in the sound discretion of the district court, and is \"often dependent as much on \nthe equities of [the] case as the substance of the legal issues it presents.\" Trump v. Int'l Refugee Assistance \n-, -, \nPivject,  U.S.  137 S.Ct. 2080, 2087 (2017). \nII. \nBackground of the case \nIn May 2018, this Court granted declaratory and injunctive relief in favor of Plaintiff Jarrod \nStringer and former plaintiffs Benjamin Hernandez andJohn Woods. The Court found, based on largely \nuncontested  facts,  that Defendants  violated the  National  Voter  Registration Act,  52 U.S.C.  §j \n20503(a)(1), 20504(a), (c), (d), and (e), and 20507(a)(1)(A), and the Equal Protection Clause, U.S. Const. \namend. XW,  1, by failing to permit simukaneous voter registration with online driver's license renewal \nand change-of-address transactions. The Court permanently enjoined Defendants from continuing to \nviolate the NVRA and Equal Protection Clause and ordered them to establish procedures that treat each \nonline driver's license renewal or change-of-address application as a simultaneous application for voter \nregistration which must then be submitted to the Secretary of State.

Chief Judge Owen wrote: \nPlaintiffs contend that they have demonstrated a substantial risk that they will suffer a future \ninjury as a result of the DPS System's noncompliance with the NYRA and Equal Protection \nClause. As Plaintiffs concede, to do so, they must demonstrate \"a sufficient probability that \neach Plaintiff will use the noncompliant driver's license services again.\" All three Plaintiffs \ndeclared that they \"plan to continue transacting online with [DPS] in the future whenever \n[they are] required to renew or change the address on [their] driver's license and [are] eligible \nto do so.\" However, each Plaintiff will have the occasion to use the DPS System to update \nhis voter registration only if (1) he moves within Texas, in which case he might wish use the \nDPS System to change his address on file with DPS and his county voter registrar, or (2) he \nbecomes both unregistered to vote and eligible to renew his driver's license using the DPS \nSystem, in which case he might wish to use the DPS System to renew his driver's license and \nregister to vote. \nPlaintiffs rely on two types of evidence that they contend demonstrate a substantial risk that \nthey will move again. The first is evidence of their prior movesHemandez and Woods \nhave each moved once in the past five years, and Stringer has moved several times. \nHowever, evidence that a plaintiff has taken an action in the past does not, by itself, \ndemonstrate a substantial risk that the plaintiff will take the action in the future; there must \nbe some evidence that the plaintiff intends to take the action again. Accordingly, evidence \nthat Plaintiffs moved in the past does not establish a substantial risk that they will do so in \nthe future. Notab/y, no Plaintiff has expressed aiy intention to move in the future. \nThe second type of evidence cited by Plaintiffs is data from the United States Census Bureau \nshowing that Americans can expect to move 11.7 times in their lifetimes. This general data \nalso does not establish a substantial risk that Plaintiffs themselves will move again; Plaintiff- \nspecific evidence is needed before Plaintiffs' claims can be properly characterized as an \nattempt to remedy an imminent injury to Plaintiffs instead of a generalized grievance \navailable to all Texans. \nPlaintiffs also have not demonstrated a substantial risk that they will attempt to use the DPS \nSystem to renew their driver's licenses and simultaneously update their voter registrations. \nPlaintiffs contend that Texas's requirement that driver's licenses must be renewed every six \nyears and the existence of Texas laws providing multiple avenues for the cancellation of a \nvoter's registration create a \"sufficient probability\" that, at some point in the future, \nPlaintiffs will be both unregistered to vote and eligible to renew their driver's licenses using \nthe DPS System. However, Plaintiffs do not point to any Plaintiff-specific evidence \nsuggesting that they will become unregistered and eligible to renew their driver's licenses \nusing the DPS System. \nIn light of the absence of any Plaintiff-specific evidence, the evidence in the record does not \ndemonstrate a substantial risk that Plaintiffs will become unregistered and eligible to renew \ntheir driver's licenses online. Plaintiffs cite Texas laws that provide for the cancellation of \nvoter registration in four relatively uncommon situations: (1) when a voter's registration card \nis returned as undeliverable, the voter does not return a confirmation notice, and the voter \ndoes not vote in two consecutive general elections; (2) when a registrar fmds a voter to be \nineligible after an investigation; (3) when another voter from the same county successfully \nchallenges a voter's registration; and (4) when a voter cancels his or her voter registration. \n4 \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 46   Filed 01/30/20   Page 5 of 17\nThere is no evidence in the record that suggests that any Plaintiff is likely to fall within the \nambit of these provisions. Furthermore, Texans are only required to renew their driver's \nlicenses every eight years, and every other renewal must be accomplished in person. Chances \nare slim that Plaintiffs will become unregistered around the time that they need to renew \ntheir driver's licenses and are eligible to do so using the DPS System. \nIn sum, Plaintiffs have not established a substantial risk that they will attempt to update their \nvoter registrations using the DPS System and be injured by their inability to do so. As a \nresult, Plaintiffs have not established an injury in fact sufficient to confer standing to pursue \nthe declaratory and injunctive relief that they seek. \nStringer v. W/hitleji, 942 F.3d at 721-23 (emphasis added). \nJudge Ho, concurring, stated: \nI agree with my colleagues that we are not at liberty to decide the merits in this case, because \nnone of these Plaintiffs have standing to seek injunctive relief here. They all secured their \nright to vote by the 2016 election cycle. And they claim no future injury that we can redress \ntoday.. .  . But although we have no occasion to decide the merits of Plaintiffs' claim due to \ntheir lack of a future injury, that does not prevent us from acknowledging that Plaintiffs have \nindeed endured an injury in the past. They were unable to exercise their right to vote in past \nelection cycles. And it is a right they will never be able to recover. As citizens, we can hope it \n- \nis a deprivation they will not experience again  even if the law does not afford them a \nremedy from this court at this time. \nStringer v. W/hitlej, 942 F.3d at 726 (emphasis in original). \nIII. \nFacts giving rise to the current claims \nAlthough the Fifth Circuit found, based on the facts in the record at that time, that Mr. \nStringer had not proven he would likely sustain another injury in the future, it has happened again. \nBefore November 23, 2019, Mr. Stringer moved from a residence in Bexar County to a new \nresidence in Harris County. On November 23, 2019, Mr. Stringer had his wife visit the DPS website \nto change the address on his driver's license. He would have also had his wife update his voter \nregistration online when updating his driver's license, but was not given the option. Thus, he \nremains registered at his old address in Bexar County. If his registration is not updated before \nFebruary 3, 2020, he will not be able to vote in the March 2020 primary election in the county and \nprecinct where he resides. Mr. Stringer also states, in his uncontested sworn declaration, that he \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 46   Filed 01/30/20   Page 6 of 17\nplans to move residences again in 2020. Specifically, he and his wife plan to move out of their \ncurrent rental apartment and into a new residence by August 25, 2020 at the latest. Docket no. 5-1, \nAppx. 178-180. \nCo-plaintiff John Harms, who was not a plaintiff in Stringer I, was a resident of Bastrop \nCounty prior to July 2019. At that time, he was registered to vote and did vote in Bastrop County. In \nmid-July 2019, Mr. Harms moved from Bastrop County to Travis County, where he signed a one- \nyear lease on a house. On or about October 8, 2019, he visited the DPS online system and \ncompleted the process to change the address on his driver's license to his new residence in Travis \nCounty. If he had been provided the option to simultaneously update his voter registration, he \nwould have done so. He was not provided that option, and he remains unregistered at this time to \nvote in Travis County. If Mr. Harms' voter registration is not updated before February 3, 2020, he \nwill not be able to vote in the March 2020 primary election. Mr. Harms' sworn declaration is also \nuncontested. Docket no. 5-1, Appx. 182-183. \nCo-plaintiff Nayeli Gomez, who was not a plaintiff in Stringer I, moved from one residence \nin Bexar County to a new residence in Bexar County in the Summer of 2019. On December 9, 2019, \nshe visited the DPS online system to change the address on her driver's license to her new address \nbut she was unable to simultaneously update her voter registration. She would have simultaneously \nupdated her voter registration if she had been given the option, but she was not given that option. \nShe remains registered at her old address and will not be able to vote in her home precinct in the \nMarch 2020 primary election if her registration is not updated before February 3, 2020. Docket no. \n5-1, Appx. 185-1 86. \nCurrent and former plaintiff Jarrod Stringer, along with current plaintiffs Nayeli Gomez, \nJohn Harms, MOVE Texas Civil Fund, and League of Women Voters of Texas and Intervenor- \nplaintiffs Texas Democratic Party, DCCC, and DSCC, now assert the same causes of action at issue \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 46   Filed 01/30/20   Page 7 of 17\nin Stringer I because Defendants have not changed their practices and new violations have occurred, \ni; \nresulting in a continuing injury and/or threatened future injury. Docket no.  Docket no. 137. \nIv. \nThe scope of relief currently being considered \nPlaintiffs' Emergency Application for Preliminary Injunction was filed three days after the \nfiling of Plaintiffs' original complaint. After filing their motion, Plaintiffs significantly narrowed the \ntemporary injunctive relief they are seeking. Within that scope of relief, the continuing injury and/or \nthreatened future injury suffered by the individual plaintiffs is the most urgent, given the February 3 \ndeadline for Texans to register to vote and/or update their voter registration. The temporary \ninjunctive relief sought by these individuals should also be easily redressable before the February 3 \ndeadline. Thus, due to strict time restraints, the Court is currently considering only the very narrow \ntemporary relief sought by the three individuals plaintiffs. The remaining relief sought in the \nEmergency Application for Preliminary Injunction has been taken under advisement, but is held in \nabeyance at this time. \nV. \nStanding to seek temporary injunctive relief \nand substantial likelihood of success on the merits \nA.  What Plaintiffs must show to have standing \nIn Stringer I, the Fifth Circuit set forth the applicable standard for determining whether the \nindividual plaintiffs have Article III standing: \nTo have Article III standing, a plaintiff must show an injury in fact that is fairly traceable to \nthe challenged action of the defendant and likely to be redressed by the plaintiff's requested \nrelief. Courts have divided this rule into three components: injury in fact, causation, and \nredressability. The party seeking to invoke federal jurisdiction, in this case the Plaintiffs, \nbears the burden of establishing all three elements. \n4Docketed in 20-CV-46. \n7 \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 46   Filed 01/30/20   Page 8 of 17\nRequests for injunctive [] relief implicate the intersection of the redressability and injury-in- \nfact requirements. The redressability requirement limits the relief that a plaintiff may seek to \nthat which is likely to remedy the plaintiffs alleged injuries. Because injunctive  relief \n[  ] \n\"cannot conceivably remedy any past wrong,\" plaintiffs seeking injunctive  relief can \n[  ] \nsatisfy the redressability requirement only by demonstrating a continuing injury or threatened \nfuture injury. That continuing or threatened future injury, like all injuries supporting Article \nIII standing, must be an injury in fact. To be an injury in fact, a threatened future injury must \nbe (1) potentially suffered by the plaintiff not someone else; (2) \"concrete and \nparticularized,\" not abstract; and (3) \"actual or imminent, not 'conjectural' or 'hypothetical.\" \nThe purpose of the requirement that the injury be \"itnniinent\" is \"to ensure that the alleged \ninjury is not too speculative for Article III purposes.\" For a threatened future injury to \nsatisfy the imminence requirement, there must be at least a \"substantial risk\" that the injury \nwill occur. \nStringer v. Whitley, 942 F.3d at 720-21 (internal citations omitted). \nB. The challenged action \nThe challenged action in question is Defendants' violation of the National Voter \nRegistration Act (N\\TRA), 52 U.S.C. § 20501, et. seq. and the Equal Protection clause, U.S. const. \namend. XW,  1. For purposes of seeking temporary injunctive relief, Plaintiffs Jarrod Stringer and \n§ \nNayeli Gomez seek relief under both the NVRA and the Fourteenth Amendment. Mr. Harms \nasserts his right to temporary injunctive relief under an Equal Protection claim only. \nIt is undisputed that on the dates in question, Stringer and Gomez were denied the right to \nsimultaneously update their voter registration when they updated the address on their drivers license \nthrough DPS' online procedure. This is a violation of the NVRA, 52 U.S.C.  20503(a)(1) \n§ \n(\"notwithstanding any other Federal or State law, in addition to any other method of voter \nregistration provided for under State law, each State shall establish procedures to register to vote in \n- \nelections for Federal office  (1) by application made simuitaneons/y with an application for a motor \nvehicle driver's license\"). It is undisputed that on the dates in question the applications completed by \nStringer and Gomez for updating their driver's license did not serve as applications for voter \nregistration. This is a violation of the NYRA, 52 U.S.C.  20504(a) (1),(2) (\"Each State motor vehicle \n§ \ndriver's license application (including any renewal application) submitted to the appropriate State \n8 \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 46   Filed 01/30/20   Page 9 of 17\nmotor vehicle authority under State law shall serve as an application for voter registration.\"). It is \nundisputed that the DPS form completed by Stringer and Gomez does not include voter registration \nas part thereof; and registering to vote elsewhere would require information that duplicates \ninformation provided in the DPS driver's license form. This is a violation of the NVRA, 52 U.S.C. \n20504(c) (1),(2), and (d) (\"Each State shall include a voter registration application form for elections \nfor Federal office as part of an application for a State motor vehicle driver's license  The voter \n- \nregistration applicationportion of an application for a State motor vehicle driver's license  ma  not \nrequire anji information that duplicates information required in the driver'c license portion oft he form. .  . Any \nchange of address form submitted in accordance with State law for purposes of a State motor \nvehicle driver's license shall serve as notification of change of addressf or voter registration with respect to \nelections for Federal office for the registrant involved unless the registrant states on the form that \nthe change of address is not for voter registration purposes.\"). \nBoth Stringer and Gomez have provided written notice of the NVRA violations to the \nSecretary of State, the chief election official for the State of Texas, and the violations have not been \ncorrected within the time set forth in the  Not only have Defendants expressly refused to \nstatute.5 \n5Section 20510 provides a private right of action for any person \"who is aggrieved by a violation \nof this chapter,\" 52 U.S.C.  20510(a)-(b), and the \"rights and remedies.  are in addition to all other \n. . \nrights and remedies provided by law,\" 52 U.S.C.  20510(d). \nThe notice provision in  20510(b) further states: \n§ \n(1) A person who is aggrieved by a violation of this chapter may provide written notice of the \nviolation to the chief election officials of the State involved. \n(2) If the violation is not corrected within 90 days after receipt of a notice under paragraph (1), \nor within 20 days after receipt of the notice if the violation occurred within 120 before the date \nof an election for Federal office, the aggrieved person may bring a civil action in an appropriate \ndistrict court for declaratory or injunctive relief with respect to the violation. \n(3) If the violation occurred within 30 days before the date of an election for Federal office, the \naggrieved person need not provide notice  to the  chief election official of the State under \nparagraph (1) before bringing a civil action under paragraph (2). \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 46   Filed 01/30/20   Page 10 of 17\ncorrect the violations, but they have failed to offer any assistance in updating and confirming \nStringer and Gomez's voter registration. At the hearing, Defendants suggested that Plaintiffs can just \ngo somewhere else to update their registration by February 3. The mandates of the NVRA dictate \nexactly the opposite of what Defendants now suggest Plaintiffs should do to avoid being \ndisenfranchised on March 3: engage in a second transaction with another agency, which requires a \nseparate application with duplicate information and the burden of mail, postage, and/or personal \ndelivery. Congress lifted these burdens to make voter registration easier, not more confusing and \ndifficult.6 \nDefendants essentially claim that when it comes to online services they cannot comply with \nthe NYRA because it conflicts with state law. The Court previously addressed this asserted \njustification in Stringer I, which the Fifth Circuit did not reach. Thus, the Court has re-visited the \nissue and reaches the same conclusion.7 First, the provisions of the NVRA neither incorporate Texas \nelection law nor make it subject thereto.8 Second, Texas election law cannot be used as an excuse for \n52 U.S.C.  20510(b)(2)-(3). \n6The Court also notes that Mr. Stringer is reportedly chronically ill. Docket no. 10 (docketed in \n20-CV-46). Again,  the NVRA was intended to remove barriers that make voter registration more \nrestrictive or inconvenient for all voters, but this is especially important for voters like Mr. Stringer. 52 \nU.S.0  20506(a)(5)(C) states that agencies designated to provide voter registration services shall not. \n\"take any action the purpose or effect of which is to discourage the applicant from registering to \nvote.\" DPS and SOS cannot simply tell Texans to go somewhere else to register to vote. \n7Because time is of the essence, the Court's written analysis to determine \"likelihood of success\" \nat this juncture is necessarily less extensive than the merits analysis in 2018. However, the parties have \nagreed that neither the law nor Defendants' practices have changed since the Court's merits analysis in \n2018. \n8just briefly, in 52 U.S.C.  20504(a) (1) and (d), for example, the reference to state law means \nthe driver's license laws (i.e. the Texas Transportation Code). The NVRA was enacted under the Elections \nclause, U.S. Const. Art. I  4, ci. 1, which gives Congress the broad power to preempt, alter, and supplant state \n§ \nlaw when it comes to federal voter registration practices. Arizona ii. InterTribal County ofAri<ona, Inc., 570 U.S. 1, \n133 S. Ct. 2247, 2253-57 (2013). (\"The Clause's substantive scope is broad\" and \"Elections Clause legislation, \nso far as it extends and conflicts with the regulations of the State, necessarily supersedes them\"). To the extent \nstate voter registration procedures are inconsistent with the NVRA, they are superseded. Id. at 2253-54 (\"the state \n'Eli \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 46   Filed 01/30/20   Page 11 of 17\nfailing to comply with the NVRA. To the extent it is inconsistent with the NYRA, Texas election \nlaw must yield to the NVRA.9 And third, there in nothing in either the NYRA or state law that \nprecludes the use of electronic signatures in online driver's license-voter registration transactions. It \nis undisputed that the State of Texas already has preexisting electronically stored signatures for every \nperson that uses the online service, and could use them for both driver's license and voter \nregistration. Defendants already use electronically stored signatures for every in-person and mail \ndriver's license-voter registration transaction, which makes their refusal to accept them in online \ntransactions unexplainable.10 \nTo be clear, the NYRA does not require DPS to offer online driver's license transactions, \nbut DPS has made the choice to utilize and promote such a process. Having made this choice, and \nbecause the NVRA covers all driver's license applications, renewals, and change of address \nlaw, so far as the conflict extends, ceases to be operative\"). On the other hand, the NYRA does not supplant \nstate driver's license laws. Thus, interpreting the provisions in 52 U.S.C.  20504(a)(1) and (d) to mean that \n§ \ndriver's license applications submitted in accordance with the Texas Transportation Code shall also serve as \napplications for voter registration purposes is consistent with the purpose of the Act and the entire statutory \nscheme. \n9See n. 8. \n101t is worth noting that with twenty-first century technology and legislation such as the Global and \nNational Commerce Act (E-Sign Act) and Uniform Electronic Transactions Act (UETA), electronic signatures \nare legally recognized and widely used. 15 U.S.C.  7001 et. seq.; Unif. Electronic Transactions Act, U.L.A. (1999). \n§ \nUnder the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act, which has been adopted by Texas and 46 other states, the \nmedium in which a signature is created, presented or retained does not affect its legal significance. See UETA § \n7; Tex. Bus. & Corn. Code Ann.  322.007(a),(c),(d) (Vernon 2015) (TUETA). As these provisions explain: a \n§ \nrecord or signature may not be denied legal effect or enforceability solely because it is in electronic form; if a law \nrequires a record to be in writing, an electronic record satisfies the law; if a law requires a signature, an electronic \nsignature satisfies the law. Texas law permits SOS and DPS to accept electronic records and electronic signatures. \nSee Tex. Bus. & Corn. Code § 322.017 (each state agency has  the option to accept electronic records and \nelectronic signatures); Tex. Bus. & Corn. Code  322.007 (\"If a law requires a signature, an electronic signature \n§ \nsatisfies the law.\"); see also Tex. Bus. & Corn. Code § 322.008(a) (\"If parties have agreed to conduct a transaction \nby electronic means and a law requires a person to provide, send, or deliver information in writing to another \nperson, the requirement is satisfied if the information is provided, sent, or delivered, as the case may be, in an \nelectronic record .  .  .\"); Tex. Bus. & Com. Code § 322.012 (\"if a law requires that a record be retained, the \nrequirement is satisfied by retaining an electronic record\"); Tex. Govt Code  2054.060 (\"digital signature may \n§ \nbe used to authenticate a written electronic communication sent to a state agency\"); I Tex. Admin. Code  203.24 \n§ \n(describing technology that may be acceptable for use by state agencies). \n11 \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 46   Filed 01/30/20   Page 12 of 17\ntransactions, the online change of address transactions must be treated no differently than the in- \nperson and mail transactions. See 52 U.S.C. § 20504(a)(1) (\"Each State motor vehicle driver's \napplication.  .\"). Defendants have offered no viable defense to the statutory violations in question \n. \nor their continued refusal to comply with the NYRA. Based on the facts currently before the court, \nthere is a substantial likelihood that Plaintiffs Stringer and Gomez will succeed on the merits of their \nNVRA claims. \nPlaintiffs Stringer, Gomez, and Harms also assert that Defendants' refusal to provide voter \nregistration applications simultaneously with online driver's license transactions constitutes a \nviolation of their Equal Protection rights under the Fourteenth Amendment)' The right to vote is a \nfundamental right protected under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. \nHarperu.  Va. State Bd. ofE  lections, 383 U.S. 663, 670 (1966). \"The right to vote is protected in more \nthan the initial allocation of the franchise. Equal protection applies as well to the manner of its \nexercise.\" Bush v. Gore, 531 U.S. 98, 104 (2000) (per curiam). The Equal Protection Clause applies \nwhen state procedures restrict voters' rights. Bush v.

See 52 U.S.C.  20501(a)(3) (Congressional findings). While the State can impose \nreasonable restrictions, those restrictions must be justified by specific interests that outweigh the \nburden on voters. It is undisputed that Defendants permit simultaneous voter applications for \npersons who renew or change their driver's license in person or by mail, but refuse simultaneous \nvoter applications for persons who renew or change their driver's license online. Persons who renew \nor change their driver's license in person or by mail need only check a single box indicating that he/she \nwould like to register or update his/her voter information. After checking the box on the driver's license \nform, rio further steps are necessary. DPS sends the updated information to SOS in nightly batches, so the \nvoter registration is updated timely and efficiently. However, persons who renew or change their driver's \nlicense online are denied the same process. They first go through the steps to renew or change the address \non their license online, then must end their DPS driver's license transaction before going to SOS to obtain, \nprint, and complete a separate voter registration application which requires duplicate information. Once the \nframework in two landmark cases: Anderson and Burdick\"). \n13 \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 46   Filed 01/30/20   Page 14 of 17\nadditional application is complete, it must be mailed or hand delivered. DPS, a voter registration agency, \nmaintains a procedure that accepts simultaneous voter registration applications for some, while rejecting \nthem for others. This type of restriction on voter registration imposes a burden on the fundamental right to \nvote that warrants the demonstration of a corresponding interest sufficiently weighty to justify the limitation. \nAgain, Defendants' only justification for the voter registration burden imposed these voters is the \n\"signature\" requirement under Texas election law. However, neither federal nor state law limits the signature \nrequirement to physical hand written signatures on paper (or \"wet\" signatures). Electronic signatures and \nelectronic records are legally recognized and widely used, and Defendants offer no reason for refusing to \naccept them for online transactions. DPS already uses electronic records and previously imaged electronic \nsignatures for every Texan that uses the online system for driver's license renewal or change of address. And \nthe Secretary of State already uses electronic records and previously imaged electronic signatures for voter \nregistration purposes. There is no reason why Defendants cannot use them in an online driver's license-voter \nregistration transaction when it already uses them in mail and in-person transactions. \nNeither the law nor the facts support Defendants' alleged justification for limiting simultaneous \nvoter applications to in-person and mail transactions and refusing simultaneous voter applications for \npersons that renew or change their driver's license online. Because the alleged justification is not legitimate, \nthere is no state interest that outweighs the burden imposed on voters. Defendants fail to demonstrate a \ncorresponding interest sufficiently weighty to justify the limitation on voters' rights. \nBased on the facts currently before the Court, there is a substantial likelihood that Plaintiffs \nStringer, Gomez, and Harms will succeed on the merits of their Equal Protection claims. \nVI. \nInjury in fact, causation, redressability. and irreparable harm \nIt is undisputed that Plaintiffs Stringer, Gomez, and Harms were not simultaneously \nregistered to vote (i.e., their voter registration was not updated) at the time of their online \n14 \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 46   Filed 01/30/20   Page 15 of 17\ntransactions with DPS, a designated voter registration agency. It is undisputed that they are still \nunregistered to vote and will be disenfranchised on March 3 if they are not registered to vote by the \n- \ndeadline  February 3. This continuing injury (lack of voter registration as a result of Defendants' \nunlawful procedure) and threatened future injury (disenfranchisement) more than satisfies the \nstanding necessary for injunctive relief. See Stringer v. W/hitleji, 942 F.3d at 720 (\"plaintiffs seeking \ninjunctive  relief can satisfy the redressability requirement only by demonstrating a continuing \n[ ] \ninjury or threatened future injury.\"). The Plaintiffs' continuing and threatened future injury will be \n(1) potentially suffered by these plaintiffs, not someone else; (2) \"concrete and particularized,\" not \nabstract; and (3) \"actual or imminent, not 'conjectural' ot 'hypothetical.' \"Id. at 720-21. With the \ndeadline for voter registration in just a few days, and the primary election thirty days thereafter, there \nis a \"substantial risk\" that the individual plaintiffs will be disenfranchised if they are not registered to \nvote; thus, threatened future injury is indisputably \"imminent.\" Moreover, Plaintiffs' continuing and \nfuture threatened injury is \"fairly traceable\" to the challenged action of Defendants. But for \nDefendants failure to comply with the NVRA, and the unjustified burden on Plaintiffs' \nconstitutional rights, Plaintiffs would already be registered to vote in the county and precinct where \nthey reside. \n- \nThe future injury  disenfranchisement  is irreparable. The right to vote is a fundamental \nright, and the deprivation of such right is something Plaintiffs \"wifi never be able to recover.\" Stringer \nv. Whitlej, 942 F.3d at 726. (Ho, J., concurring). But the injury that will occur between now and \nMarch 3 is still redressable with immediate, temporary injunctive relief. These individual plaintiffs \nshould not be forced to wait and suffer a constitutional deprivation when it can be avoided by \ngranting temporary injunctive relief. Texas v.  U.S., 809 F.3d at 173 n. 137 (citing United States v. \nEmerson, 270 F.3d 203, 262 (5th Cir. 2001)). \n15 \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 46   Filed 01/30/20   Page 16 of 17\nVII. \nBalance of harm and public interest \n- \nThe harm to the individual plaintiffs  being disenfranchised  clearly outweighs the minimal \nburden, if any, that will be placed on Defendants by simply being ordered to perform their duties \nand take the necessary steps to ensure that these three individuals are registered to vote. The public \nclearly has a paramount interest in removing voter registration barriers and having procedures that \nencourage rather than discourage voter registration. Defendants have offered no factual or legal \nargument that would justify denying the simultaneous voter registration to which these individual \nplaintiffs are entitled. \nVIII. \nTemporary relief being ordered \nThe temporary relief being ordered herein is narrowly tailored, and the Court orders no \nmore than what the law clearly and unequivocally requires of Defendants. There is an expectation, \nunder the notice provisions of the NVRA, that if a designated voter registration agency such as DPS \n- \nviolates the NVRA, the chief election official of the State  upon notification  will correct the \nviolation.13 That is all the Court is ordering herein. Compliance with this order will ensure that the \nindividual plaintiffs herein will not be forced to suffer a continuing or threatened future injury. \nFor the reasons stated herein, which are based on a preliminary review, the Court \nORDERS that pursuant to 52 U.S.C.  20504(d), the last change of address forms submitted \n§ \nby the individual plaintiffs for purposes of updating the address on their driver's license \n\"shall serve as notification of change of address for voter registration with respect to \n13To be clear, Defendants could have avoided this type of emergency relief by simply agreeing to assist \nplaintiffs in getting their voter registration updated  a duty and obligation they already have under the law. \n16 \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 46   Filed 01/30/20   Page 17 of 17\nelections for Federal offlce for the registrant involved.\" Defendant DPS must immediately \nsubmit the information contained in the previously completed forms, along with the \nindividual plaintiffs stored electronic signatures, as necessary, to the Texas Secretary of \nState.14 The Secretary of State will then immediately submit the same information to the \ncorrect county voter registrars, along with a copy of this injunction order and written \ninstructions to immediately register these individual plaintiffs to vote. The Secretary of State \nmust confirm that all three individual plaintiffs are registered tovote before the deadline to \nregister to vote so they may participate in the upcoming primary elections. When that \nconfirmation is received, Defendants must file a written advisory with the Court no later \nthan 2:00 p.m. on February 3 confirming that all three individual plaintiffs are timely \nregistered to vote in the county and precinct in which they reside. If Defendants must \ndesignate one or more employees, agents, or representatives to carry out this order, they are \nexpected to do so. \nThe Emergency Application for Preliminary Injunction is GRANTED in part, and the rest \nof the preliminary injunctive relief being sought is held in abeyance. \n/ \nSIGNED and ENTERED this  day of January, 2020 at  o'clock  [. m.. \nORLANDO L. GARCIA \nCHIEF U.S. DISTRICT JUDGE \n141n other words, DPS and SOS will treat it the same way they would treat an in-person or mail- \nin change of address form and follow generally the same submission process set forth in 52 U.S.C. \n20504(e)(2),  but on an expedited basis so that completion of voter registration occurs before the \ndeadline. \n17 ",

INTRODUCTION \nDefendants the Texas Secretary of State and the Director of the Department of Public \nSafety (“DPS”) have brazenly refused to bring their illegal voter registration practices into \ncompliance with the National Voter Registration Act (“NVRA”) and the Equal Protection Clause, \ndespite this Court’s orders on the motions for summary judgment in Stringer v. Pablos, No. SA-\n16-CA-257-OG, (“Stringer I”), and the Fifth Circuit’s express acknowledgement that Defendants’ \nconduct disenfranchised the Stringer I plaintiffs in the 2018 elections, taking from them “a right \nthey will never be able to recover.” Stringer v. Whitley, 942 F.3d 715, 726 (5th Cir. 2019) (Ho, J., \nconcurring) (emphasis in original). The Texas Democratic Party (“TDP”), DCCC, and DSCC \n(collectively, “Intervenors”) filed this action to ensure that Texans are not denied the right to vote \nin a single additional election as a result of Defendants’ illegal conduct. And while resolution of \nthis case has always been critically important to protect Texans’ right to vote, it has particular \nrelevance now because even more Texans are likely to update their driver’s license information \nonline in light of the COVID-19 global pandemic and be disenfranchised by Defendants’ conduct.1  \nDefendants continue to try to delay this litigation by recasting, in their motion to dismiss, \narguments that this Court has already grappled with and decided in favor of Intervenors. Contrary \nto Defendants’ claims, Intervenors have established that they have standing and that their equal \nprotection claim has merit—indeed, it has already been deemed meritorious once before by this \nCourt. This Court should deny Defendants’ motion to dismiss (ECF No. 56 (“Mot.” or “MTD”)) \n                                                           \n1 In fact, the DPS website currently states that, due to COVID-19, “all Driver License Offices will \nbe closed effective immediately” and instructs Texans to renew their driver’s licenses or update \ntheir addresses online. See Tex. Dep’t of Public Safety, “Restricted Driver License Office Services \nand  Closures,”  https://www.dps.texas.gov/DriverLicense/covid-19.htm  (last  visited  May  12, \n2020). \n1 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 71   Filed 05/14/20   Page 8 of 29\n \nand grant Intervenors’ pending motion for leave to file for summary judgment, ECF Nos. 41, 43, \n54 (“MSJ”) so that the merits of this case may be expeditiously resolved.   \nII.  ARGUMENT \nA.  This Court has subject matter jurisdiction. \n1.  Intervenors are properly before this Court. \n \n  Defendants begin by pressing an argument that this Court has considered numerous times, \nin each case deciding it in favor of Intervenors. For the reasons discussed in Intervenors’ briefing \non the Motion to Intervene (ECF Nos. 16, 26), Defendants’ Motion to Sever (ECF No. 49), and \nIntervenors’ MSJ, Defendants’ arguments that Intervenors were incorrectly permitted to intervene \nin Stringer I, have no merit. See Stringer I, No. 16-cv-00257-OLG (ECF Nos. 133, 142, 161). And \ngiven that the Court has clarified that the Motion to intervene was construed as a request to \nintervene in Stringer II and granted on that basis, this argument is now moot and need not be \naddressed any further. \n2.  Intervenors have standing. \nIntervenors have alleged facts sufficient to demonstrate that they, and their members and \nconstituents, have suffered and will suffer legally cognizable injuries as a result of Defendants’ \nconduct, such that they have standing to pursue this action in this Court. Intervenors have satisfied \nArticle III’s requirements for both organizational standing and associational standing. Defendants’ \narguments to the contrary—including their assertions regarding statutory standing—have no merit.   \n  a.  Standard of Review for Motions to Dismiss on Standing \nOn a motion to dismiss, the Court must accept the plaintiffs’ allegations of fact as true, \nincluding as related to the plaintiffs’ standing. See Den Norske Stats Oljeselskap As v. HeereMac \nVof, 241 F.3d 420, 424 (5th Cir. 2001) (citing Barrera-Montenegro v. United States, 74 F.3d 657, \n2 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 71   Filed 05/14/20   Page 9 of 29\n \n659 (5th Cir. 1996)); Lujan v. Defs. Of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 561 (1992); see also Hotze v. \nBurwell, 784 F.3d 984, 992 (5th Cir. 2015) (finding “[a]t the pleading stage, general factual \nallegations of injury resulting from the defendant’s conduct may suffice” to establish standing). \nThe Court may consider “(1) the complaint alone, (2) the complaint supplemented by undisputed \nfacts evidenced in the record, or (3) the complaint supplemented by undisputed facts plus the \ncourt’s resolution of disputed facts.” Den Norske Stats Oljeselskap As, 241 F.3d at 424. \n  A plaintiff must satisfy three criteria to establish a case or controversy sufficient to give a \nfederal court standing over their claims: (1) that they have suffered or are about to suffer an “injury \nin fact”; (2) that there exists “a causal connection between the injury and the conduct complained \nof”; and (3) that it is “likely, as opposed to merely speculative, that the injury will be redressed by \na favorable decision.” Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560. These requirements apply when a plaintiff alleges \nstanding on their own behalf, and they similarly apply when a plaintiff brings a case based on \nassociational standing. OCA-Greater Houston v. Texas, 867 F.3d 604, 609–10 (5th Cir. 2017); see \nalso Order at 9, Richardson v. Tex. Sec’y of State, No. SA-19-cv-00963-OLG (W.D. Tex. Dec. 23, \n2019).  \n    b.  Intervenors have direct organizational standing. \nWith respect to Intervenors’ organizational standing, Defendants challenge only the first \nof Article III’s requirements—whether Intervenors have sufficiently alleged an injury in fact. They \ndo not challenge either the causation or redressability requirements. See Mot. at 6. Defendants’ \narguments on this score are easily rebutted.  \nFirst, as the Fifth Circuit recognized in Democratic Party v. Benkiser, 459 F.3d 582, 587 \n& n.4 (5th Cir. 2006), “[v]oluminous persuasive authority” holds that political party organizations \nhave standing to challenge state laws that threaten the electoral prospects of their candidates. See \n3 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 71   Filed 05/14/20   Page 10 of 29\n \nalso id. at 586 (finding TDP had “direct standing” based on “harm to its election prospects”); Smith \nv. Boyle, 144 F.3d 1060, 1061–63 (7th Cir. 1998); Schulz v. Williams, 44 F.3d 48, 53 (2d Cir.1994); \nOwen v. Mulligan, 640 F.2d 1130, 1132–33 (9th Cir. 1981); Democratic Party of the United States \nv. Nat’l Conservative Political Action Comm., 578 F. Supp. 797, 810 (E.D. Pa. 1983); Bay Cty. \nDemocratic Party v. Land, 347 F. Supp. 2d 404, 423 (E.D. Mich. 2004)). In this case, Defendants’ \ncontinuing illegal conduct directly threatens the electoral prospects of the candidates that the \nIntervenors support for a very simple reason: it makes it exponentially harder for voters who would \nsupport them to register to vote. \nSecond, an organization suffers an Article III injury when it must divert resources from its \nusual activities to lessen the harm caused by an act that causes injury to the organization’s mission \nor members. See, e.g., Havens Realty Corp. v. Coleman, 455 U.S. 363, 379 (1982). The Fifth \nCircuit has made clear that the impact to an organization’s activities or resources does not need to \nbe large to establish standing; an organization can establish standing by demonstrating a slight \nimpairment to its activities. See OCA-Greater Houston, 867 F.3d at 610-12 (explaining that the \ninjury requirement is “qualitative, not quantitative, in nature,” and that the injury need not be \nlarge).  Furthermore, “an organization suffers an injury in fact when a statute ‘compel[s]’ it to \ndivert more resources to accomplishing its goals,” and “‘[t]he fact that the added cost has not been \nestimated and may be slight does not affect standing, which requires only a minimal showing of \ninjury.’” Fla. State Conference of N.A.A.C.P. v. Browning, 522 F.3d 1153, 1165 (11th Cir. 2008) \n(internal citation omitted). \nHere,  Intervenors  easily  clear  these  bars.  All  three  Intervenors  in  this  case  have \ndemonstrated injuries in the form of diversion of resources that clearly distinguish them as \norganizations “with a direct stake in the outcome of [this] litigation . . . from [organizations] with \n4 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 71   Filed 05/14/20   Page 11 of 29\n \na mere interest in the problem.” Mot. at 10 (citation omitted). Intervenors’ Complaint plainly states \nthat the TDP, DCCC, and DSCC have been directly injured by Defendants’ conduct because, to \nbe successful in their efforts to elect Democratic candidates in Texas, they must expend more \nresources and divert resources from other uses to specifically combat Defendants’ failure to permit \nsimultaneous updates to registration information for voters who update their driver’s license \ninformation online. See ECF No. 28 at ¶¶ 11-13. At the pleading stage, these allegations alone are \nsufficient to establish Intervenors’ standing. Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560-61. And here, the specific facts \nbear out Intervenors’ allegations. See, e.g., ECF No. 43-1 ¶ 10-11 (TDP); ECF No. 43-3 ¶ 7 \n(DSCC); ECF No. 43-2 ¶ 11 (DCCC); DCCC Decl. ¶¶ 7-8, 10, 13; DSCC Decl. ¶¶ 5-6; TDP Decl. \n¶¶ 11-12; TDP Tr. 30:17-21. \nTDP has significantly expanded its voter registration efforts in preparation for the 2020 \nelections in large part because of Defendants’ failure to comply with the NVRA and equal \nprotection. Indeed, this year TDP is engaging in the largest voter registration program in the history \nof the state of Texas, ECF No. 43-1 ¶ 11, with a goal of registering about 2.6 million unregistered, \neligible Democratic voters, TDP Decl. ¶ 14. TDP understands that Defendants’ conduct has caused \nand is likely to cause confusion and disenfranchisement among Texas voters, because when an \neligible voter changes their address online with DPS, the webpage will eventually ask the voter if \nthey want to register to vote. If the person answers, “yes,” then the website directs the eligible \nvoter to a new website that the eligible voter must navigate to complete the process. But this new \nwebsite does not simply allow the eligible voter to register. Instead, the eligible voter must request \nthat the state mail a voter registration application for the eligible voter to complete, affix their own \nstamp, and return. Prelim. Inj. Tr. 6:12-17, 8:24-9:5; 14:15-25, 32:5-11 ECF No. 57. Despite this \nCourt’s previous decision, this process has not changed. Id. at 5:20-25; 17:5-6 (Defendants admit \n5 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 71   Filed 05/14/20   Page 12 of 29\n \nthat “[t]he process has been the same since 2015.”). \nTo  combat  voter  confusion  and  disenfranchisement  as  a  result  of  Defendants’ \nunconstitutional practices described above, TDP is devoting significant funds and personnel time \nto preemptively mass mail voter registration applications to voters who may have attempted to \nregister online through DPS, TDP Tr. 68:20-69:10, and educate voters on the confusing pitfalls of \nTexas’s voter registration requirements. Defendants’ assertion that TDP “does not allege diversion \nof any resources at all,” Mot. at 9, is clearly wrong. TDP views of all of its activities as focused \non electing Democratic candidates in Texas, but TDP is clear that its voter registration program \nhas required more resources than it would have if Defendants’ voter registration practices were \nconstitutional. ECF No. 28 ¶¶ 11-12; TDP Decl. ¶¶ 11-13,15; see also TDP Tr. 82:7-9 (“And most \nof this we wouldn’t have to do if people could update their registration when people got their \ndriver’s license updates.”). This is because Defendants’ conduct limits the effectiveness of TDP’s \nregistration program, as TDP must try to register more voters than it would otherwise due to its \nvalid concern that registered individuals will be disenfranchised due to Defendants’ conduct. ECF \nNo. 28 ¶ 12.  \n Defendants’ conduct has similarly caused DCCC and DSCC to divert resources from other \nefforts to elect Democrats to the U.S. House of Representatives and U.S. Senate, respectively. Both \ndirectly and through their support of the TDP, DCCC will have to divert resources from its other \nwork to increasing its voter registration and GOTV efforts in Texas. Moreover, DCCC is spending \nmore money in Texas on voter registration and GOTV efforts than it otherwise would. For \nexample, DCCC has already spent nearly $400,000 this election cycle to compensate a consultant, \nSisneros Strategies, to conduct a robust program to register voters in Texas Congressional District \n23. DCCC Decl. ¶ 7; DCCC Tr. 82:10-83:22. DCCC has opened four offices in Texas, DCCC Tr. \n6 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 71   Filed 05/14/20   Page 13 of 29\n \n28:15-16, and hired staff on the ground to both engage with and register voters. Id. 82:14-22; \n83:14-17 (“And then we also have staff on the ground who work directly for the DCCC whose \nroles involve a lot of community engagement and help with voter registration.”). DCCC anticipates \nultimately spending millions of dollars to register and mobilize voters in Texas in advance of the \n2020 elections. ECF No. 43-2 ¶ 6; DCCC Decl. ¶ 11. Neither DCCC nor DSCC have unlimited \nfunds, and because both are national party committees, they have had to, and will continue to have \nto, divert resources from other states to voter registration and GOTV programs in Texas because \n“voter registration’s going to have to be a higher priority than it might be in another state where \nit’s easier to register folks.” DSCC Tr. 23:9-17; DCCC Tr. 100:1-9 (explaining the importance of \nvoter registration in Texas). DCCC, for example, could have spent the $400,000 (or some portion \nthereof) that it paid to Sisneros Strategies on digital voter persuasion efforts to protect swing \ndistricts within Texas and nationwide. \nIn addition, DCCC and DSCC actively support TDP’s voter registration and GOTV efforts \nthrough financial and staffing resources, ECF No. 43-2 ¶ 9. Through a program called the \n“coordinated campaign,” DCCC and DSCC each plan to transfer a significant amount of funds to \nTDP to support Democratic candidates in Texas in races up and down the Democratic ticket. This \nelection cycle especially, DCCC and DSCC will transfer funds to the coordinated campaign to \nhelp fund TDP’s voter education and voter engagement programs on the ground. DCCC has \nalready transferred over $145,000 to TDP for voter registration this election cycle, DCCC. Tr. \n81:10-14, 83:10-13 (“We have – with the money that we have sent to the Texas Democratic Party, \nI believe at least two people who have been hired with the express purpose of assisting voter \nregistration efforts.”). And, DCCC anticipates transferring more, given its need to help support \nTDP’s voter registration program to achieve its mission. DCCC Decl. ¶ 9. In advance of the 2020 \n7 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 71   Filed 05/14/20   Page 14 of 29\n \nelections, DSCC intends to give significant sums to TDP to spend on its field program, which will \nnecessarily involve, among many things, voter registration efforts, to help elect Democratic \ncandidates from Texas to national office. DSCC Tr. 37: 10-13, 37:21-24 45:20-22, 57:20-59:5. \nThus far this election cycle, DSCC has transferred $25,000 to the TDP. DSCC Tr. 37:10-13. DCCC \nand  DSCC  support  TDP’s  field  programs  because  they  increase  the  number  of  registered \nDemocratic voters in Texas and the number of voters who support DCCC’s and DSCC’s endorsed \ncandidates. See id. DCCC Tr. 79:6-9; 100:2-9. \nDCCC and DSCC have diverted funds to spend on voter registration in Texas because they \nrecognize that voters in Texas are not given the opportunity to update their voter registration \ninformation at the same time that they update their driver’s license information. ECF No. 43-2 ¶ \n11; DCCC Decl. ¶¶ 7-8; DSCC Tr. 23:9-17. DCCC and DSCC are injured in the same way that \nTDP is injured: they must spend additional funds and allocate more resources to educate and \nregister those who mistakenly believe they registered to vote through DPS’s website and are denied \nthe right to vote at the polls, like the original plaintiffs in this action. They must also persuade \nadditional voters to turn out to vote in order to compensate for voters who are disenfranchised due \nto Defendants’ conduct. ECF No. 43-3 ¶ 7; DSCC Decl. ¶ 5; DSCC Tr. 35:25-36:8, 37:21-24.  \nDefendants are incorrect to assert that the activities undertaken by an organization to \ncounteract a challenged state action must fall outside the scope of the organization’s mission or \ncentral initiatives to constitute a diversion of resources sufficient to establish standing. See Havens \nRealty Corp., 455 U.S. at 379 (finding organizational plaintiff HOME sufficiently alleged injury-\nin-fact where defendant apartment complex’s racial steering practices made it more difficult for \nHOME to achieve its mission of providing “equal access to housing through counseling and other \nreferral services” even though providing such services were within the scope of HOME’s regular \n8 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 71   Filed 05/14/20   Page 15 of 29\n \nactivities); see also OCA-Greater Houston, 867 F.3d at 610 (finding OCA’s primary mission is \nvoter outreach and civic education, and the challenged laws forced OCA to expend more resources \non those activities to educate voters about Texas’s restrictions on interpretation assistance for \nEnglish-limited voters). \nNor is an organization is not required to quantify the exact cost or resources expended to \nestablish standing. See, e.g., Crawford v. Marion Cty. Election Bd., 472 F.3d 949, 951 (7th Cir. \n2007), aff’d, 553 U.S. 181 (2008) (“The fact that the added cost has not been estimated and may \nbe slight does not affect standing, which requires only a minimal showing of injury.”). Defendants \nincorrectly cite N.A.A.C.P. v. City of Kyle as standing for the proposition that an organizational \nplaintiff must identify “specific projects that [it] had to put on hold or otherwise curtail in order to \nrespond to’ the defendant’s conduct” in order to establish standing. Mot. at 7. In doing so, \nDefendants attempt to heighten the standard for organizational standing, an argument that the Fifth \nCircuit expressly rejected in OCA Greater Houston, when it clarified that by asking the lobbying \norganization plaintiff in City of Kyle to show that it put specific projects on hold, the court “was \nnot . . . heightening . . . the Lujan standard, but [merely offering] an example of how to satisfy it \nby pointing to a non-litigation-related expense.” 867 F.3d at 612. In fact, the Fifth Circuit expressly \ndismissed any notion of “imposing a higher burden on organizations seeking to establish standing.” \nId.  \nEspecially relevant to Intervenors’ standing, courts have repeatedly held that political party \ncommittees, which have a direct and particular interest in the outcome of elections, have direct \norganizational standing when they divert resources to educate their supporters and constituents \nabout how to overcome laws that will make it more difficult for them to access their right to the \nfranchise. See, e.g., Democratic Nat’l Comm. v. Reagan, 329 F. Supp. 3d 824, 841 (D. Ariz.), aff’d, \n9 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 71   Filed 05/14/20   Page 16 of 29\n \n904 F.3d 686 (9th Cir. 2018), reh’g en banc granted, 911 F.3d 942 (9th Cir. 2019) (finding \nplaintiffs DNC, DSCC, and Arizona Democratic Party have direct organizational standing to \nchallenge election laws that will require them “to retool their GOTV strategies and divert more \nresources to ensure that low-efficacy voters are returning their early mail ballots . . . [and] to \neducate their voters” on those laws); Lee v. Va. State Bd. of Elections, 188 F. Supp. 3d 577, 584 \n(E.D. Va. 2016), aff’d, 843 F.3d 592 (4th Cir. 2016) (finding Democratic Party of Virginia “has \nshown sufficient injury primarily in the form of diversion of time, talent, and resources to educate \ntheir voters and implement the requirements of the Virginia voter identification law”); see also, \ne.g., Democratic Party of Ga., Inc. v. Crittenden, 347 F. Supp. 3d 1324, 1337 (N.D. Ga. 2018); \nOhio Org. Collaborative v. Husted, 189 F. Supp. 3d 708, 726 (S.D. Ohio 2016), rev’d sub nom. \non other grounds, Ohio Democratic Party v. Husted, 834 F.3d 620 (6th Cir. 2016); Democratic \nNat’l Comm. v. Bostelmann, No. 20-CV-249-WMC, 2020 WL 1320819, at *3 (W.D. Wis. Mar. \n20, 2020). To satisfy standing, political parties can show either past or future diversion of these \nresources. See, e.g., Miller v. Brown, 462 F.3d 312, 317-18 (4th Cir. 2006) (“Knowing that voters \nwholly unaffiliated with the plaintiffs’ party will participate in their primary dramatically changes \nthe plaintiffs’ decisions about campaign financing, messages to stress, and candidates to recruit. \nBecause campaign planning decisions have to be made months, or even years, in advance of the \nelection  to  be  effective,  the  plaintiffs’  alleged  injuries  are  actual  and  threatened.”).  Here, \nIntervenors not only allege, but have proved, both. \n3.  Intervenors have associational standing. \n \nIn addition to establishing standing based on injuries sustained by the organizations \nthemselves, Intervenors have standing based on the injuries suffered by their members and \nconstituents. An organization may bring suit on behalf of its members or constituents when: (1) its \n10 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 71   Filed 05/14/20   Page 17 of 29\n \nmembers and constituents would otherwise have standing to sue as individuals; (2) the interests at \nstake are germane to the group’s purpose; and (3) neither the claim made nor relief requested \nrequires the participation of individual members or constituents in the suit. Benkiser, 459 F.3d at \n587 (citing Hunt v. Wash. State Apple Adver. Comm’n, 432 U.S. 333, 345 (1977)).  \nCourts have universally rejected Defendants’ argument that “[n]ot having members is fatal \nto associational standing.” Mot. at 11. Indeed, that is the clear teaching of the U.S. Supreme Court’s \ndecision in Hunt. See 432 U.S. at 344 (holding organization does not need formal membership \nstructure to have standing); see also Pub. Interest Research Grp. of N.J., Inc. v. Magnesium \nElektron, Inc., 123 F.3d 111, 119 (3d Cir. 1997) (rejecting argument that organizations lacked \nstanding because their charters prohibit them from having members). But in any event, Intervenors \nhave  sufficiently  alleged  that  they  do  have  members,  whom  they  generally  consider  to  be \nDemocratic voters and supporters. ECF No. 28 at ¶¶ 11-13; DSCC Tr. 52:9-15; DCCC Tr. 108:8-\n18; TDP Tr. 98:7-13. \nCourts have repeatedly  held that political parties like  Intervenors have associational \nstanding on behalf of their voter members when they have challenged state laws that would make \nit more difficult for their members to engage in the political process. See, e.g., Crawford, 472 F.3d \nat 951 (finding the “Democratic Party also has standing to assert the rights of those of its members \nwho will be prevented from voting by the new [photo ID] law”); Fla. Democratic Party v. Scott, \n215 F. Supp. 3d 1250, 1254 (N.D. Fla. 2016) (holding that Florida Democratic Party had standing \non behalf of voters “who intend[ed] to register as Democrats and who will be barred from voting” \ngiven the state’s closure of voter registration).2 Indeed, in a voting case brought recently to address \n                                                           \n2 See e.g., Reagan, 329 F. Supp. 3d at 831; Georgia Republican Party v. Sec. & Exch. Comm’n, \n888 F.3d 1198, 1203 (11th Cir. 2018); Sandusky County Democratic Party v. Blackwell, 387 F.3d \n565, 573-74 (6th Cir.2004); Bay County Democratic Party v. Land, 347 F.Supp.2d 404, 422 (E.D. \n \n11 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 71   Filed 05/14/20   Page 18 of 29\n \nburdens imposed on voters by Wisconsin state election laws particularly in light of the current \npublic health crisis, a federal district court found that both the DNC and the Democratic Party of \nWisconsin had standing to sue on behalf of their members who would face undue burdens on their \nright to vote in elections held during the public health emergency of the COVID-19 pandemic. \nBostelmann, 2020 WL 1320819. \nDefendants’  argument  that  Intervenors  must  identify  a  specific  member  to  establish \nassociational standing is legally erroneous under Fifth Circuit precedent. See Hancock Cty. Bd. of \nSupervisors v. Ruhr, 487 F. App’x 189, 198 (5th Cir. 2012) (“We are aware of no precedent holding \nthat an association must set forth the name of a particular member in its complaint in order to \nsurvive a Rule 12(b)(1) motion to dismiss based on a lack of associational standing.”); see also \nOrder  at  12-13,  Richardson,  No.  SA-19-cv-00963-OLG  (holding  pleadings  sufficient  for \nassociational standing where the “organization[] is comprised in significant part by individuals \nwho are likely to be impacted by the relevant policies at issue”). It is enough that Intervenors can \nbroadly identify the fact that there are eligible voters in Texas who will update their driver’s license \ninformation online and attempt to update their voter registration information at the same time, but \nwho will be denied updated registration due to Defendants’ illegal voter registration practices. Fla. \nDemocratic Party, 215 F. Supp. 3d at 1254 (“Plaintiff need not identify specific aspiring eligible \nvoters who intend to register as Democrats and who will be barred from voting; it is sufficient that \nsome inevitably will. Plaintiff thus has standing.”); see also Democratic Party of Ga., Inc., 347 F. \nSupp. 3d at 1337. If anything, the likelihood that Intervenors’ members and constituents will \nupdate their driver’s license information online as opposed to leaving their homes to travel to a \n                                                           \nMich.2004); Georgia Republican Party v. Sec. & Exch. Comm’n, 888 F.3d 1198, 1203 (11th Cir. \n2018); Fla. Democratic Party v. Hood, 342 F. Supp. 2d 1073, 1079 (N.D. Fla. 2004); Fla. \nDemocratic Party v. Scott, 215 F. Supp. 3d 1250, 1254 (N.D. Fla. 2016). \n12 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 71   Filed 05/14/20   Page 19 of 29\n \nDPS office is even higher given the health risks associated with exposure to the public during the \nCOVID-19 public health crisis. Any of these voters could sue in their own right, and Intervenors \nhave standing to carry this lawsuit forward to protect their interests. In fact, Intervenors have gone \nbeyond their minimal burden to show standing because at least one of the named plaintiffs in this \ncase is a constituent of Intervenors.  \nDefendants’  final  arguments  regarding  Intervenors’  associational  standing  are  easily \ndismissed,  once  they  are  untangled.  Defendants  begin  with  a  headscratcher,  asserting: \n“[Intervenors] have not identified any interest germane to their purpose that is to be served by this \nlitigation.”  Mot.  at  12.  To  get  here,  Defendants  contort  this  litigation  into  something \nunrecognizable: to hear Defendants tell it, the lawsuit is not about Defendants’ refusal to allow \neligible voters to register online when they update their driver’ licenses, but rather about voters’ \nrecords. See Mot. at 13. To be clear, this lawsuit is about eligible voters’ inability to simultaneously \nregister to vote when they update their driver’s licenses online when these same voters would be \nable to simultaneously register to vote had they updated their licenses in person with DPS. \nIntervenors’ interest in ensuring that its members and constituents have equal opportunities to \nregister to vote is clear and germane to their missions: increasing the number of registered \nDemocratic voters in Texas will mean that more voters can turn out to vote for Democratic \ncandidates.  \nFinally, Intervenors have associational standing because neither the declaratory relief nor \nthe injunction they seek requires individual voters to participate in this lawsuit. Benkiser, 459 F.3d \nat 588 (finding TDP has associational standing on behalf of its members, which is proven in part \nby the type of relief sought, i.e. an injunction, which benefits the whole group). Intervenors seek \nsystemic changes to the online driver’s license system so that all eligible voters who update their \n13 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 71   Filed 05/14/20   Page 20 of 29\n \ndriver’s licenses online will have an opportunity to simultaneously register to vote. Intervenors’ \nrequested relief is in no way tied to individual voters and therefore does not require their individual \nparticipation. Hunt, 432 U.S. at 343 (“Indeed, in all cases in which we have expressly recognized \nstanding in associations to represent their members, the relief sought has been [declaratory or \ninjunctive relief].”). \n4.  Intervenors have statutory standing. \n \n  Defendants’ final argument on standing, that 42 U.S.C. § 1983 does not permit Plaintiffs \nto challenge Defendants’ actions burdening the right to vote because organizations are third parties \nthat do not have the right to vote, Mot. at 13-15, has been previously rejected by the Fifth Circuit, \nand for good reason. The statutory standing inquiry asks courts “to determine, using traditional \ntools of statutory interpretation, whether a legislatively conferred cause of action encompasses a \nparticular plaintiff's claim.” Lexmark Int’l, Inc. v. Static Control Components, Inc., 572 U.S. 118, \n127 (2014). In other words, statutory standing requires that the plaintiff bringing suit under a \nstatute establish that it is “within the class of plaintiffs whom Congress has authorized to sue.” Id. \nat 127-28; see also White Glove Staffing, Inc. v. Methodist Hosps. of Dallas, 947 F.3d 301, 307–\n08 (5th Cir. 2020) (noting the zone of interests test with respect to claims brought pursuant to 42 \nU.S.C. § 1981 is “not especially demanding”) (quotation marks and citation omitted). \nThe Fifth Circuit has expressly interpreted Section 1983 to allow suits by organizations \nthat  have  established  organizational  or  associational  standing.  Ass’n  of  Am.  Physicians  & \nSurgeons, Inc. v. Tex. Med. Bd., 627 F.3d 547, 551 (5th Cir. 2010) (holding nonprofit had standing \nto assert § 1983 claims on behalf of its members in seeking prospective declaratory and injunctive \nrelief); Church of Scientology of Cal. v. Cazares, 638 F.2d 1272, 1278 (5th Cir. 1981); see also \nAllee v. Medrano, 416 U.S. 802, 819 n.13 (1974); Jornaleros de Las Palmas v. City of League \n14 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 71   Filed 05/14/20   Page 21 of 29\n \nCity, 945 F. Supp. 2d 779, 800 (S.D. Tex. 2013) (finding organization was authorized to sue under \n§ 1983 on behalf of its members); Inclusive Communities Project, Inc. v. Tex. Dep’t of Hous. & \nCmty. Affairs, 749 F. Supp. 2d 486, 496 (N.D. Tex. 2010) (finding organizational plaintiff suffered \nan injury to its resources, and this was enough to establish standing to bring a claim under 42 \nU.S.C. § 1983); 1 Martin A. Schwartz, Section 1983 Litigation: Claims and Defenses § 2.01[C][3] \n(4th Ed. 2020-1 Supp.) (“[I]f an organization satisfies the Supreme Court’s test for organizational \nstanding, it should be allowed to maintain suit under § 1983 to redress the rights of its members.”). \nDefendants rely on cases that merely illustrate the general prohibition on individual, third-party \nstanding; but all are inapposite because they do not involve organizations that assert associational \nor organizational standing.3    \nB.  Intervenors have alleged a cognizable equal protection claim. \nThis Court has held that Defendants’ conduct, which remains unchanged from Stringer I, \nviolates the Equal Protection Clause. The Court denied Defendants’ motion to dismiss the same \nclaim in Stringer I, 5:16-cv-00257-OLG, ECF No. 52, and then found for the plaintiffs on the \nmerits of the claim at summary judgment, Stringer v. Pablos, 320 F. Supp. 3d 862, 897-900 (W.D. \nTex. 2018), rev’d and remanded sub nom. Stringer v. Whitley, 942 F.3d 715 (5th Cir. 2019). None \nof these rulings were disturbed on appeal. Stringer, 942 F.3d 715. This claim has not changed, and \nneither have Defendants’ defenses. The Court should again deny Defendants’ motion.  \n                                                           \n3 Defendants rely on Danos v. Jones, 652 F.3d 577 (5th Cir. 2011), to support their position, but \nthat case considered the standing of an individual seeking to assert third-party standing on behalf \nof a federal judge under 28 U.S.C. § 752, a statute governing the appointment of law clerks and \nsecretaries. That holding has no application to this case, where Plaintiffs have established direct \nand associational standing. See Veasey v. Perry, 29 F. Supp. 3d 896, 905 (S.D. Tex. 2014) (“Here, \nthe successful assertion of associational standing (both organizational and representational) fulfills \nprudential standing concerns and obviates the need to apply concepts of third-party standing as to \nthe associations.”). Even if Danos could support the point Defendants suggest, its “statutory \nstanding” limitation would only apply to the statute at issue in that case. See Sierra Club v. Morton, \n405 U.S. 727, 732 (1972). \n15 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 71   Filed 05/14/20   Page 22 of 29\n \n1.  Legal Standard  \n \nA claim should only be dismissed if a court determines that it is “beyond doubt” that the \nclaimant cannot prove a plausible set of facts that support the claim and would justify relief. See \nBell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007). Rule 12(b)(6) motions to dismiss are \ngenerally disfavored and rarely granted. Turner v. Pleasant, 663 F.3d 770, 775 (5th Cir. 2011).  \n2.  Defendants  are  collaterally  estopped  from  denying  their  conduct \n  violates equal protection. \n   \n  Before reaching Defendants’ incorrect arguments on the merits, this Court should find that \nDefendants are precluded from relitigating the equal protection claim under the doctrine of \ncollateral  estoppel,  which  promotes  judicial  economy  by  preventing  “needless  litigation.” \nParklane Hosiery Co., Inc., v. Shore, 439 U.S. 322, 326 (1979). Collateral estoppel applies here \ndespite the Fifth Circuit’s reversal in Stringer I because the appellate decision did not address the \nmerits and thus does not control the substance of the Court’s original judgment. Langley v. Price, \n926 F.3d 145, 167 (5th Cir. 2019). Defendants are not permitted a second bite at the apple to \nrelitigate issues that have already been thoroughly briefed and examined, and that were not \ndisturbed on appeal.  \n  When determining whether the doctrine of collateral estoppel applies, courts analyze the \nfollowing four factors: whether “(1) the issue under consideration is identical to that litigated in \nthe prior action; (2) the issue was fully and vigorously litigated in the prior action; (3) the issue \nwas necessary to support the judgment in the prior case; and (4) there is no special circumstance \nthat would make it unfair to apply the doctrine.” Winters v. Diamond Shamrock Chem. Co., 149 \nF.3d 387, 391 (5th Cir. 1998). This case easily satisfies each factor.  \n  First, Intervenors’ Complaint sets forth the exact same equal protection claim that the \nparties have already litigated. Compare ECF No. 28 (Intervenors’ Complaint) to Stringer I, ECF \n16 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 71   Filed 05/14/20   Page 23 of 29\n \nNo. 1 (Plaintiffs’ Original Complaint) at ¶¶ 1, 20-21, 59. Intervenors allege that DPS does not \nprovide simultaneous voter registration with online DPS transactions despite doing so with mail \nand in-person transactions. ECF No. 28 at ¶ 27. Intervenors allege that “[b]y arbitrarily subjecting \neligible voters to disparate voter registration standards, Defendants have denied voters an equal \nopportunity to participate in federal and state elections in violation of Section 1 of the Fourteenth \nAmendment.” Id. at ¶ 33. Plaintiffs alleged the same equal protection violation in their original \ncomplaint: “Unlike Defendants’ simultaneous voter registration services for license renewal or \naddress update applications submitted in-person at a DPS office, Defendants do not provide for \nsimultaneous voter registration[.]” Stringer I, ECF No. 1 at ¶ 39. There can be no doubt that \nIntervenors satisfied the first factor necessary to apply collateral estoppel.  \n  Second, the equal protection claim was fully and vigorously litigated in the previous action.  \nJohnson v. United States, 576 F.2d 606, 614 (5th Cir. 1978) (“A party who has had one fair and \nfull opportunity to prove a claim and has failed in that effort, should not be permitted to go to trial \non the merits of that claim a second time.”). Defendants argued that “state law prevent[ed] them \nfrom complying with federal law.” Stringer, 320 F. Supp. 3d at 868. Defendants consistently \njustified  their  conduct  by  stating  that  Texas  law  required  “renewal  and  change  of  address \ntransactions performed online [to have] a signature on paper for voter registration purposes.” Id. \nat 874; see also id. at 877. But Defendants did not dispute the underlying facts—if anything, \nDefendants conceded that eligible voters were renewing their licenses and changing their addresses \nonline and that these transactions did not simultaneously accomplish voter registration. See id. at \n878 (“This is a very possible thing to do what you’re saying if it was legal, and it’s not legal . . . \nSo I’m not contesting the logistics of it. We can agree that it’s a possible thing to do.”).  \n  The Court’s order turned squarely on whether Texas law prevented Defendants from \n17 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 71   Filed 05/14/20   Page 24 of 29\n \nallowing simultaneous registration for online transactions with DPS. The parties vigorously \nlitigated this question and the Court, after extensive analysis, found that Texas must allow for \nsimultaneous registration for online transactions with DPS. Stringer I, 320 F. Supp. 3d at 900-901. \nThat Intervenors, as organizations rather than individuals, now carry these claims is of no moment; \nthe arguments are still purely legal ones, and are not dependent on the identity of the plaintiffs. \n  Third, the issues underlying Intervenors’ equal protection claim were necessary to support \nthe Court’s initial judgment. Winters, 149 F.3d at 392 (finding this factor met when the issue “was \nintegrally related to—indeed, it constituted the crux of—the particular judgment”). The issue \nunderlying Intervenors’ equal protection claim is whether Texas must allow for simultaneous voter \nregistration when eligible voters complete renewal or change of address applications using DPS’s \nonline portal. See generally ECF No. 28. This issue was the crux of the Court’s decision in Stringer \nI, which found that “[n]either the law nor the facts support Defendants’ alleged justification for \nlimiting simultaneous voter applications to in-person and mail motor voter transactions and \nrefusing simultaneous voter applications for motor voters that renew or change their driver’s \nlicense online.” Stringer I, 320 F. Supp. 3d at 900. It is indisputable that the determination of the \nissue—that  is,  whether  Texas  must  allow  for  simultaneous  online  voter  registration—was \nnecessary and essential to this Court’s resulting judgment. See Restatement (Second) of Judgments \n§ 27, cmt. j (1982) (instructing collateral estoppel should be applied when “the issue was actually \nrecognized by the parties as important and by the trier as necessary to the final judgment”).  \n  Finally, there are no other circumstances that would otherwise make it unfair to apply \ncollateral estoppel. Intervenors are not seeking to relitigate the issues, but instead are seeking a \nremedy to their injuries that already exist. Parklane Hosiery Co., 439 U.S. at 330-32 (describing \ncircumstances where applying collateral estoppel would be unfair). Defendants are precluded by \n18 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 71   Filed 05/14/20   Page 25 of 29\n \ncollateral estoppel from contending that their conduct does not violate equal protection. \n3.  The Anderson/Burdick test applies to the equal protection claims here, \n  and does not require evidence of intentional discrimination \n \n  If  the  Court  were  to  consider,  once  again,  Defendants’  arguments  on  the  merits, \nIntervenors’ equal protection claim  is properly evaluated  under  the legal test derived  from \nAnderson v. Celebrezze, 460 U.S. 780 (1983) and Burdick v. Takushi, 504 U.S. 428 (1992).  \nDefendants appear to contend that the Intervenor political parties are required to prove \nintentional discrimination and disproportionate impact on Democrats in order to allege a violation \nof equal protection. See Mot. at 16-20. They are incorrect. A claim alleging a violation of equal \nprotection in the voting context is properly evaluated under Anderson-Burdick. See, e.g., Rogers \nv. Corbett, 468 F.3d 188, 193-94 (3rd Cir. 2006) (“[T]he Anderson test is the proper method for \nanalyzing such equal protection claims due to their relationship to the associational rights found \nin the First Amendment”); Republican Party of Ark. v. Faulkner Co., 49 F.3d 1289, 1293 n. 2 (8th \nCir. 1995) (holding Anderson sets out proper method for balancing both associational and equal \nprotection concerns because “[i]n election cases, equal protection challenges essentially constitute \na branch of the associational rights tree”); Fulani v. Krivanek, 973 F.2d 1539, 1543 (11th Cir. \n1992) (“In this circuit, however, equal protection challenges to state ballot-access laws are \nconsidered under the Anderson test.”); Rosen v. Brown, 970 F.2d 169, 178 (6th Cir. 1992) \n(“utilizing the Anderson balancing test” in a challenge based on claims of free association and \nequal  protection).  Just  as  this  Court  considered  the  equal  protection  claim  in  Stringer  I, \nIntervenors’ claim is appropriately evaluated under Anderson-Burdick, despite Defendants’ similar \nprotestations. Stringer I, 320 F. Supp. 3d at 898. \nThe Anderson-Burdick test requires courts to weigh “the character and magnitude” of the \nalleged burden, against the “precise interests put forward by the State.” Burdick, 504 U.S. at 434. \n19 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 71   Filed 05/14/20   Page 26 of 29\n \nThis assessment must “tak[e] into consideration the extent to which those interests make it \nnecessary to burden the [P]laintiffs’ rights.” Id. at 428. Any burden, however slight, “must be \njustified by relevant and legitimate state interests sufficiently weighty to justify the limitation.” \nStringer v. Pablos, Civil No. SA-16-CV-257-OG, 2020 WL 532937, at *7 (W.D. Tex. Jan 30, \n2020). No part of this assessment requires Intervenors to show intentional discrimination or \ndisproportionate impact.    \n4.  Defendants cannot satisfy the Anderson-Burdick test. \n  As this Court previously determined, Defendants’ conduct fails the Anderson-Burdick test \nand violates equal protection. Stringer, 320 F. Supp. 3d at 899-901. Defendants repeat the same \njustifications for the law that they asserted the first time around, but none justify the differential \ntreatment of voters who engage in online transactions with DPS from voters who engage in in-\nperson or mail transactions with DPS. Id. at 899-900. As this Court already determined, electronic \nsignatures are “legally recognized and widely used” and “DPS already uses electronic records and \npreviously imaged electronic signatures for every Texan that uses the online system for driver’s \nlicense renewal or change of address.” Id. Further, there is no evidence of fraud or potential fraud \nin any instance where an eligible voter wishes to simultaneously register to vote when they update \ntheir driver’s license online. This Court came to the correct conclusion previously, and Defendants \noffer  no  basis  to  compel  a  different  ruling  on  the  merits,  much  less  to  justify  dismissing \nIntervenors’ complaint for failure to state a claim. \nIII.

The parties \nmust address the following at the preliminary injunction hearing:1 \n1.  What facts or law have changed since the claims and issues were decided in Stringer l?2 \na.  Is standing to assert the 2020 claims the only new issue? \nb.  Have Defendants' practices changed since Stringer I? \n2.  Whether each individual, organizational, and associational plaintiff and intervenor plaintiff \nhas standing to pursue the declaratory and injunctive relief set forth in their complaints, \nwith facts and supporting authority. \n'The parties do not need to brief all of these matters prior to the hearing, but must address them as part of their \npresentation. \n2 Stringer I refers to the 2016 claims. Unless the Court refers to Stringer I, it is referring to the 2020 claims. The \nInterverior Plaintiffs filed their complaint in December 2019, but for ease of reference the Court will refer to all \nnew claims as the 2020 claims. \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 31   Filed 01/24/20   Page 2 of 3\n3.  Whether the parties agree that the Court need only find that one plaintiff/movant has \nstanding to proceed with the merits of the preliminary injunction motion. \n4.  If any party claims that the Court cannot rely on the facts already developed in the Stringer \nI \nrecord, provide supporting authority. \n5.  Additionally, Defendants must provide the Court with the following: \na.  If Defendants' practices have changed since Stringer I, describe each change, why it \nwas made, when it was made, and who decided to make such change(s). If no \nchanges occurred, whether there have been any discussions about making changes.3 \nb.  Explain who made the decision to make the change to Step 5 of the online process \ndescribed in paragraph one, page 16, of Plaintiffs' Emergency Application for \nPreliminary Injunction, why the decision was made, and what Defendant(s) sought \nto accomplish with this change. Explain why this language in Step 5 of the online \nprocess is different than the language contained in DL-14A, DL-43, and DL-64, as \nreflected on page 13 of Plaintiffs' Emergency Application for Preliminary Injunction. \nc.  Since the inception of online services, the number of persons who, like Jarrod \nStringer, have more than once renewed or updated their driver's license online \nthrough DPS, answered \"yes\" to the voter registration/application question or \nindicated that they wanted to register to vote or update their voter registration as \npart of the same transaction, and were not simultaneously permitted to do so. \nd.  Since November 2016: the total number of persons who renewed or updated their \ndriver's license online, answered \"yes\" to the voter registration/application question \nor indicated that they wanted to register to vote or update their voter registration \nas part of the same transaction, and were not simultaneously permitted to register \nto vote or update their voter registration. \ne.  Since November 2016: the number of persons who renewed or updated their \ndriver's license online, answered \"yes\" to the voter registration/application question \nor indicated that they wanted to register to vote or update their voter registration \nas part of the same transaction, were not simultaneously registered to vote or their \nvoter registration was not updated, and are still not registered to vote and/or their \nvoter registration has not been updated as a result. \nf.  For any persons identified in subparagraph e. above, explain whether this is a \ncontinuing violation or continuing injury. Provide supporting authority. \nCourt is referring to intra or inter agency discussions, not discussions with legal counsel. \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 31   Filed 01/24/20   Page 3 of 3\ng.  Since November 2016: (i) the number of persons who renewed or updated their \ndriver's license in person, indicated that they wanted to register to vote or update \ntheir voter registration as part of the same transaction, and were registered to vote \nand/or their voter registration was updated as a result of that transaction; and (ii) \nthe number of persons who updated their driver's license by mail, indicated that \nthey wanted to register to vote or update their voter registration as part of the \nsame transaction, and were registered to vote and/or their voter registration was \nupdated as a result of that transaction. \nh.  The number of times the Secretary of State has rejected electronic signatures \nsubmitted by DPS for voter registration purposes based on a finding of fraud, and \nthe steps that would be taken to notify the voter if this ever occurred. \ni.  A reasonable estimate of time it would take Defendants to come into full \ncompliance with the NVRA provisions in question. \n6.  Finally, Plaintiffs must explain the scope of preliminary injunctive relief they are seeking and \nsubmit a proposed order setting out that relief. \nIJt \nIT IS SO ORDERED this  daVof January, \ni \nORLANDO L.

By contrast, voters who update driver’s license information in person or by mail are offered \nsimultaneous voter registration. In the 2018 election, an untold number of Texas voters were \ndenied the right to vote as a result of Defendants’ conduct, including the individual plaintiffs. The \nTexas Democratic Party (“TDP”), DCCC, and DSCC (collectively, “Intervenors”), intervened in \nthis lawsuit to stop Defendants from disenfranchising more voters in the 2020 elections. \nDefendants claim their differential treatment is rooted in Texas law, because they claim the \nTexas Election Code requires a handwritten signature for voter registration applications, and thus, \nthe use of previously captured electronic signatures for online transactions is prohibited. In fact, \nhowever, the Secretary processes thousands of in-person and mail voter registration applications \neach year using previously captured electronic signatures, and there is no valid reason why online \nvoter registration applications must be treated any differently. \nNow forced to answer for their actions a second time, Defendants make several meritless \narguments contending that they cannot be mandated by this Court to comply with the law because \nneither the five plaintiffs nor the three intervenors in this lawsuit have standing. See ECF No. 78 \nat 6-14. Under Defendants’ unsupported and extreme theory of standing, the individual voters in \nthis lawsuit essentially cannot bring their claims unless they remain unregistered to vote at their \nnew  addresses  and  suffer  the  ultimate  harm  of  disenfranchisement.  And  organizations  like \nIntervenors—who  divert  resources  from  other  activities  to  counteract  the  harm  caused  by \nDefendants; who represent the interests of and associate with individual voters who have been \n1 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 89   Filed 06/26/20   Page 8 of 33\n \ndisenfranchised as a result of Defendants’ conduct; and who suffer harm to their candidates’ \nelectoral prospects because Defendants’ conduct causes the disenfranchisement of their voter \nmembers who would vote for Democratic candidates at the polls but for Defendants’ conduct—\nlack standing because they already engage in voter registration activities and generally target their \nefforts at registering Democratic voters. Finally, according to Defendants, even if Intervenors did \nhave standing, the harm suffered by Intervenors could not be attributed to Defendants, because the \ndisenfranchisement of Intervenors’ voters is actually the voters’ fault. Id. at 11.   \nFortunately, the wheels of justice do not operate this way. As discussed herein and in \nprevious briefing, the record reflects that Intervenors have standing on numerous independent \nbases.  Moreover,  Defendants’  conduct—which  this  Court  previously  found  violates  equal \nprotection—is admittedly unchanged. Defendants offer no new reasons why this Court should \nsuddenly reverse course and find their conduct constitutional. This Court should deny Defendants’ \nCross Motion for Summary Judgment and grant Intervenors’ Motion for Summary Judgment.  \nARGUMENT \nI.  Standard of Review \n  The record is replete with evidence demonstrating Intervenors’ standing and entitling them \nto summary judgment. As noted below, infra Sections III and IV, Defendants do not dispute that \nthe facts are unchanged from this Court’s decision in Stringer v. Pablos, 320 F. Supp. 3d 862 \n(W.D. Tex. 2018) (“Stringer I”), so it is unclear how there can be a dispute of material fact related \nto their violation of the Equal Protection Clause. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a) (stating summary \njudgment is appropriate if “the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material \nfact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law”). As to standing, Intervenors have \npreviously  demonstrated  that  they  have  standing  to  pursue  this  action,  but  in  response  to \nDefendants’ newest attempt in their motion for summary judgment to draw Intervenors’ standing \n2 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 89   Filed 06/26/20   Page 9 of 33\n \ninto question, Intervenors supplement the already extensive record in this regard with additional \naffidavits to provide further support for their standing. See Cramer v. Skinner, 931 F.2d 1020, 1025 \n(5th Cir. 1991) (“When the defendant moves for summary judgment because of lack of standing, \nhowever, the plaintiff must submit affidavits and comparable evidence that indicate that a genuine \nissue of fact exists on the standing issue.”). It is, of course, axiomatic that “one party with standing \nis sufficient to satisfy Article III's case-or-controversy requirement.” See Rumsfeld v. Forum for \nAcad. & Institutional Rights, Inc., 547 U.S. 47, 52 n.2 (2006); Texas v. United States, 945 F.3d \n355, 377–78 (5th Cir. 2019) (internal quotation and citation omitted). \n  As set forth in their Motion for Summary Judgment, each Intervenor possesses standing \nbased  on  three  separate  and  distinct  types  of  injury-in-fact,  including  (1)  diversion  of \norganizational resources to counteract Defendants’ conduct; (2) harm (often in the form of total \ndisenfranchisement) to the individual voters each organization represents; and (3) harm to the \nelectoral prospects of Intervenors’ candidates. See ECF No. 77 at 7-14. Throughout their briefing, \nDefendants blatantly mischaracterize and misrepresent the record, and assert supposed deficiencies \nabout Intervenors’ evidence that have no legal bearing on their standing. Intervenors summarize \nthe legal arguments and evidence that demonstrates their standing below.  \nII.  Intervenors have standing. \nA.  Intervenors must divert resources to counteract Defendants’    \n  conduct.  \n \n  Defendants argue that because Intervenors’ voter registration activities are often targeted \nat Democratic voters, they lack standing. Respectfully, this argument is nonsensical, and it \ncontradicts  the  reality  that  courts  across  the  country  have  held  that  political  parties  suffer \norganizational harm when they divert resources to counteract a state’s unlawful voting practices. \nSee, e.g., Democratic Nat’l Comm. v. Reagan, 329 F. Supp. 3d 824, 841 (D. Ariz. 2018), aff’d, \n3 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 89   Filed 06/26/20   Page 10 of 33\n \n904 F.3d 686 (9th Cir. 2018), reh’g en banc granted, 911 F.3d 942 (9th Cir. 2019) (finding \nplaintiffs DNC, DSCC, and Arizona Democratic Party have direct organizational standing to \nchallenge certain election laws because those laws will require them “to retool their GOTV \nstrategies and divert more resources to ensure that low-efficacy voters are returning their early \nmail ballots . . . [and] to educate their voters” on those laws); Lee v. Va. State Bd. of Elections, 188 \nF. Supp. 3d 577, 584 (E.D. Va. 2016), aff’d, 843 F.3d 592 (4th Cir. 2016) (finding Democratic \nParty of Virginia “has shown sufficient injury primarily in the form of diversion of time, talent, \nand resources to educate their voters and implement the requirements of the Virginia voter \nidentification law”); Democratic Party of Ga., Inc. v. Crittenden, 347 F. Supp. 3d 1324, 1337 \n(N.D. Ga. 2018) (holding Democratic Party of Georgia’s “diversion of resources from preparation \nfor the upcoming runoff elections to assisting individuals impacted by the handling of absentee \nand provisional ballots is all the injury needed to meet the injury-in-fact requirement”); Ohio Org. \nCollaborative v. Husted, 189 F. Supp. 3d 708, 726 (S.D. Ohio 2016), rev’d sub nom. on other \ngrounds,  Ohio  Democratic  Party  v.  Husted,  834  F.3d  620  (6th  Cir.  2016)  (holding  Ohio \nDemocratic Party had shown injury-in-fact because “the challenged provisions will force [it] to \ndivert resources from ensuring their members and constituents vote to counteracting the negative \neffects of the challenged provisions.”). The fact that Democratic political party committees focus \nprimarily on registering Democratic voters should surprise no one. But Democratic voters are not \nimmune to the State’s unconstitutional conduct. And activities undertaken by Intervenors to \nregister Democrats and to counteract Defendants’ conduct are not mutually exclusive.  \n  Intervenors have diverted resources to counteract Defendants’ conduct in a multitude of \nways. See ECF No. 77 at 7-12. First, Intervenors seek to register voters who have recently moved \nto Texas or moved between counties in Texas, because Intervenors know that those voters are \n4 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 89   Filed 06/26/20   Page 11 of 33\n \nunlikely to be registered at their current address and may mistakenly think they were registered to \nvote as a result of updating their driver’s license address online. See, e.g., June 26, 2020 Decl. of \nGlen Maxey (“Maxey Decl.”) ¶¶ 6-8; Decl. of Jacqui Newman (“Newman Decl.”) ¶¶ 4-6; Decl. \nof Alicia Sisneros (“Sisneros Decl.”) ¶¶ 3-5. The TDP, for example, is engaged in a massive voter \nregistration program in urban areas across Texas targeting voters who have recently moved by \nseeking to register every voter who lives in an apartment complex. Maxey Decl. ¶ 7. As part of \nthis effort TDP placed voter registration applications and instructions on the doors of 65,000 \napartments in Travis County in January 2020. Id. ¶ 8. In another example, DCCC has targeted \nmany of its voter registration activities at registering college students, an important DCCC \nconstituency. Newman Decl. ¶¶ 6, 10. DCCC recognizes that college students, especially those \nnew to a college campus, may mistakenly think they are registered to vote as a result of updating \ntheir driver’s license address online, and DCCC undertakes efforts to register these voters.  \n  Second, Intervenors are forced to spend time, staffing, and financial resources educating \nvoters that engaging in an online driver’s license transaction does not simultaneously update voter \nregistration. For example, TDP’s deputy registrars spend time and effort explaining to voters how \nonline driver’s license transactions interact with voter registration. Maxey Decl. ¶ 9. DCCC’s \nconsultant, Sisneros Strategies, hired by DCCC in November 2019,1 expended resources to \nspecifically train its deputy registrars to inform voters that online DPS transactions do not update \na voter’s registration. Sisneros Decl. ¶ 7; see also ECF 73-2 at 94 (DCCC representative stating \nDefendants’ conduct leads DCCC “to have to spend more money on voter registration and more \n                                                            \n1  Defendants’ assertion that this contract became effective after the commencement of this lawsuit, \nECF No. 11 at 11, is both incorrect and legally irrelevant. Indeed, DCCC made its first payment \nto Sisneros Strategies on November 21, 2019 in the amount of $146,900.00. See Newman Decl. \nAttachment A. \n5 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 89   Filed 06/26/20   Page 12 of 33\n \ntime making sure we are educating voters” on this issue). Similarly, when voters inform TDP that \nthey registered to vote through a transaction with DPS, TDP deputy registrars are trained to \nencourage them to register (presumably a second time) with TDP because of the significant risk \nthat voters mistakenly believe they are registered to vote as a result of an online DPS transaction. \nMaxey Decl. ¶ 9. This is not speculation, as Defendants argue; it is fact supported by evidence. \n  Third, TDP expends resources to maintain a voter protection hotline that assists voters with \nissues related to voter registration caused by Defendants’ unconstitutional conduct. Glen Maxey, \nPrimary Director of TDP, has testified that TDP’s voter protection hotline staff and volunteers \nhave  assisted  voters  with  issues  and  questions  related  to  Defendants’  failure  to  provide \nsimultaneous voter registration for online DPS transactions in previous election cycles. App. \n472:23-473:15.2 For example, in 2018, TDP provided assistance through the voter protection \nhotline  to  Jada  Thompson,  a  23-year  old  Democratic  voter  who  was  disenfranchised  by \nDefendants’ conduct while she was in college. Decl. of Jada Thompson (“Thompson Decl.”) ¶¶ 4, \n8. As detailed in her declaration, Ms. Thompson called TDP’s hotline in October 2018, after she \nrealized that she was not registered to vote as a result of changing her driver’s license address \nonline. Id. ¶ 8. Ms. Thompson was forced to vote a provisional ballot that was ultimately not \ncounted in the 2018 election because she was not registered at her new address. Id. ¶¶ 9-10. DSCC \nand DCCC transfer funds to TDP to support its voter registration programs, including TDP’s voter \nprotection hotline, and other efforts that counteract Defendants’ conduct. Newman Decl. ¶¶ 12-15; \nJune 26, 2020 Declaration of Sara Schaumburg (“Schaumburg Decl.”) ¶¶ 4-5. \n  Defendants are wrong to assert that Intervenors would engage in these activities regardless \n                                                            \n2 Citations to “App.” or “Appendix” refer to the Appendix in Support of TDP, DSCC, and DCCC’s \nMotion for Summary Judgment, ECF No. 77-1. \n6 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 89   Filed 06/26/20   Page 13 of 33\n \nof Defendants’ conduct. Certainly, as political parties, Intervenors would still seek to register \nvoters. But if Defendants followed the Constitution and provided simultaneous voter registration \napplications to online DPS customers during driver’s license transactions, Intervenors would not \nneed to expend additional resources educating voters about this issue or registering voters who \nshould have already been properly registered. See ACORN v. Fowler, 178 F.3d 350, 361 (5th Cir. \n1999) (“A portion of the resources ACORN has spent and currently spends on voter registration \ndrives counteracts Louisiana’s alleged failure to implement the Act. It is these wasted resources, \nwhich  ACORN  could  have  put  to  use  registering  voters  that  the  NVRA,  even  properly \nimplemented, would not have reached (or which ACORN could have put toward any other use it \nwished), that provided ACORN with standing. . . .”). Intervenors could focus their efforts on \nregistering other unregistered voters, as opposed to revisiting voters who they would not have to \neducate and assist in re-registering but for Defendants’ conduct. They could also spend their \nresources assisting voters with issues unrelated to Defendants’ refusal to comply with the law.  \n  Defendants’  argument  that  Intervenors  would  engage  in  voter  registration  activities \nregardless of Intervenors’ conduct means that they lack standing, ECF No. 78 at 10, also ignores \nthat Intervenors are spending more money than ever before on voter registration and get-out-the-\nvote (“GOTV”) efforts in Texas, specifically in order to counteract the difficulties imposed by \nDefendants’  failure  to  automatically  register  individuals  who  update  their  driver’s  license \ninformation online. See ECF Nos. 71-2, 71-3, 71-4; see also Zimmerman v. City of Austin, Tex., \n881 F.3d 378, 390 (5th Cir. 2018) (finding change in a plaintiff’s “campaign plans or strategies in \nresponse to an allegedly injurious law” can itself confer an injury-in-fact so long as the change is \n“in response to a reasonably certain injury imposed by the challenged law”). Taken to its logical \nconclusion, Defendants’ argument is that any organization that has previously engaged in or is \n7 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 89   Filed 06/26/20   Page 14 of 33\n \nalready engaged in voter registration activities does not have standing to challenge Defendants’ \nillegal practices. That is not the law. Organizations like Intervenors that are engaged in voter \nregistration and GOTV activities despite the burdens imposed by Defendants’ illegal conduct are \nprecisely the types of organizations that have standing to challenge Defendants’ illegal conduct, \nbecause Defendants’ refusal to comply with the law makes it more difficult and costly for \nIntervenors to achieve their goals and missions and causes them to shift resources around. See, \ne.g., Havens Realty Corp. v. Coleman, 455 U.S. 363, 379 (1982) (finding organizational plaintiff \nalready engaged in efforts to provide equal access to housing through counseling and other referral \nservices suffered an injury-in-fact because the defendant’s racial steering practices made it more \ndifficult for the organization to do its work and achieve its mission).   \nB.  The harm to Intervenors measures more than an “identifiable trifle.” \n \nDefendants erroneously argue that Intervenors lack standing because they have not pointed \nto  specific,  quantifiable  resources  they  have  invested  or  diverted  due  to  Defendants’ \nunconstitutional conduct. ECF No. 78 at 10-11. Beyond the fact that, as described below, this \nassertion is simply false, the level of quantifiable specificity which Defendants demand finds no \nsupport in case law, because a diversion of resources need not be quantified at all to meet Article \nIII’s  requirements.  See  OCA-Greater  Houston  v.  Texas,  No.  1:15-CV-00679-RP,  2016  WL \n9651777, at *7 (W.D. Tex. Aug. 12, 2016) (“Article III injury need not be quantified by a dollar \nfigure . . . .” and “it need not measure more than an ‘identifiable trifle’”), aff’d, 867 F.3d 604 (5th \nCir. 2017) (citation omitted); see also Crawford v. Marion Cty. Election Bd., 472 F.3d 949, 951 \n(7th Cir. 2007), aff’d, 553 U.S. 181 (2008) (“The fact that the added cost has not been estimated \nand may be slight does not affect standing, which requires only a minimal showing of injury.”). In \nfact, the resources dedicated to counteracting Defendants’ conduct need not be significant to \n8 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 89   Filed 06/26/20   Page 15 of 33\n \nprovide  Intervenors  with  Article  III  standing.  See  United  States  v.  Students  Challenging \nRegulatory Agency Procedures (SCRAP), 412 U.S. 669, 689 n.14 (1973) (“We have allowed \nimportant interests to be vindicated by plaintiffs with no more at stake in the outcome of an action \nthan a fraction of a vote, a $5 fine and costs, and a $1.50 poll tax.”) (citations omitted). Intervenors \nare not required to identify a specific line item attributable to countering Defendants’ conduct. \nIn any event, Intervenors have proven a far more significant diversion of resources due to \nDefendants’ unconstitutional conduct than is necessary to clear this modest hurdle. Intervenors \nextensively laid out the various resource allocation decisions Defendants’ unconstitutional conduct \nhas forced upon them in their Motion for Summary Judgment, ECF No. 77 at 7-12, and will not \nrestate the multitude of evidence here, but a few points bear reiterating given Defendants’ \nunsupported assertions. First, Intervenors have in many cases been able to quantify how much \nthey are spending on voter registration to register more voters to compensate for the voters who \nwill inevitably be disenfranchised as a result of Defendants’ unconstitutional practices. For \nexample, DCCC spent nearly $400,000 to compensate a consultant that both directly registered \nvoters in Texas Congressional District 23, and trained DCCC staff on how to register voters in \nTexas, accounting for Defendants’ unconstitutional practices as part of their general practice. See \nalso ECF No. 85 at 80:4-6 (“The DCCC has spent directly in Texas over $1.1 million, and I believe \nover $550,000 of that is directly related to voter registration in Texas”).  \nSecond, Defendants’ myopic focus on funds is misplaced, as funds spent are not the only \nresource Intervenors have diverted due to Defendants’ unconstitutional conduct, nor are they the \nonly resource whose draining can satisfy Article III standing. See, e.g., Greater New Orleans Fair \nHous. Action Ctr. v. Kelly, 364 F. Supp. 3d 635, 646 (E.D. La. 2019) (finding drain on staff time \nsufficient for Article III standing). As discussed in Section II.A, Intervenors have diverted staff \n9 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 89   Filed 06/26/20   Page 16 of 33\n \nand  volunteer  time  combating  Defendants’  illegal  practices  through  their  voter  registration \nactivities. These efforts include, among others, the time TDP volunteers and staff have diverted to \nexplaining and helping voters address this issue on the voter protection hotline, Maxey Decl. ¶¶ \n10-13, as well as the additional staff time DCCC must spend on voter registration to educate voters \nand counteract Defendants’ ongoing unconstitutional conduct. Newman Decl. ¶ 14. Indeed, some \nof the money DCCC has transferred to TDP thus far this election cycle has been used for the \nexpress purpose of hiring two staff members dedicated solely to assisting with voter registration \nefforts. ECF No. 85 at 83:10-13. If Defendants complied with the law, TDP could spend less time \non voter registration, and those staffers could focus their efforts elsewhere. See ECF No. 78-1 at \n47:11-13. \nFinally, Defendants state that Intervenors have not changed their resource allocation \ndecisions due to Defendants’ conduct, ECF No. 78 at 10, but that is entirely inconsistent with the \nevidence in the record. See, e.g., ECF No. 78-1 at 47:10-13 (TDP stating “[w]e wouldn’t be doing \nall that activity, expending that money, expending that staff time if we had more accessible voter \nregistration in Texas.”); id. at 82:7-9 (“And most of this we wouldn’t have to do if people could \nupdate their registration when people got their driver’s license updated.”). Defendants’ conduct \nforces DSCC and DCCC to divert more of their financial resources within Texas to voter \nregistration than they would have to otherwise—taking away those resources from other important \nefforts  to  support  Democrats  within  the  state.  And,  as  national  organizations  with  limited \nresources, any additional funds the DCCC and DSCC must allocate to Texas for voter registration \nmust, of necessity, be diverted from their potential uses other states. See App. 364 ¶ 11; see also \nPavek v. Simon, No. 19-cv-3000, 2020 WL 3183249, at *11 (finding DCCC and DSCC established \nstanding based on diversion of resources in case challenging ballot order statute that favored \n10 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 89   Filed 06/26/20   Page 17 of 33\n \ncandidates in rival political parties, requiring plaintiffs “to divert resources into Minnesota that \nwould normally be spent in other states around the country”). \nC.  Intervenors engaged in voter registration activities prior to intervening in this \n  lawsuit. \n \nDefendants’ assertion that any voter registration activities on which Intervenors expend \nresources post-date this lawsuit, See ECF No. 78 at 11, is a gross distortion of the evidence. Both \nDSCC and DCCC provided resources to the TDP which went towards voter registration efforts \nprior to the commencement of this lawsuit. See Schaumburg Decl. ¶¶ 4-5; Newman Decl. ¶¶ 4, 12-\n15. DCCC itself separately initiated a nearly $400,000 contract for voter registration efforts in \nTexas (and began expending funds under the contract) prior to the commencement of this lawsuit, \nNewman Decl. ¶ 5, and TDP has been engaging in voter registration efforts and been forced to \ndivert financial and personnel resources due to Defendants’ continued unconstitutional conduct \nfor years. Maxey Decl. ¶¶ 3-4. \nIn addition to having no basis in fact, Defendants’ argument is also legally irrelevant, as \ninjury following the commencement of the lawsuit alone—indeed, even only a threatened injury—\nis sufficient to provide standing. See Susan B. Anthony List v. Driehaus, 573 U.S. 149, 158 (2014) \n(holding “future” pecuniary injury suffices for standing so long as there is a “substantial risk that \nthe harm will occur”). Intervenors easily satisfy this standard. For example, DSCC has articulated \nthat its budget for the 2020 elections is constantly in flux, and it anticipates spending “significantly \nmore in Texas than what we’ve seen already, easily into the millions,” and part of this spending \nwill be to help combat “several obstacles that Texas has put in place to turning out voters, including \nthe failure to allow for simultaneous online registration.” ECF No. 86 at 36:2-7.  \nD.  Defendants’ conduct injures Intervenors’ members.   \n  The evidence demonstrates that Intervenors also have associational standing based on the \n11 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 89   Filed 06/26/20   Page 18 of 33\n \nharm Defendants’ conduct causes to their members and constituents—Democratic voters and \nsupporters. See ECF No. 77 at 13-15; ECF No. 28 at ¶¶ 11-13; ECF No. 77-1 at 466, 594, 672. \nDefendants’  misbegotten  notion  that  Intervenors—a  state  political  party  and  two  national \ncommittees of the Democratic Party—lack members defies both logic and law. See ECF No. 78 at \n12-13. As a factual matter, a political party is, at its core, a group of individuals joined together as \na group to advance their political interests. Indeed, membership and, more importantly, increasing \nmembership, is the sine qua non of a political party. And, as a legal matter, the Supreme Court has \nheld that an organization need not be a “traditional membership organization” with card-carrying \nmembers to establish associational standing. See Hunt v. Wash. State Apple Advert. Comm’n, 432 \nU.S. 333, 345 (1977) (finding apple growers association “all of the indicia of membership in an \norganization,” including (1) power to elect members of the Commission, (2) power to serve on the \nCommission, and (3) financing of the Commission’s activities). Rather, where an organization \nrepresents individuals “and provides the means by which they express their collective views and \nprotect  their  collective  interests,”  id.,  “it  would  exalt  form  over  substance”  to  deny  that \norganization representational standing. Id. \n  Defendants do precisely what the Supreme Court cautioned against—exalt form over \nsubstance—when they argue that Intervenors lack members.3 A comparison of the relationship \n                                                            \n3 Courts rarely fall prey to Defendants’ trap, improperly elevating form over substance. See \nMecinas v. Hobbs, No. 2:19-cv-5547-DJH (D. Ariz. June 25, 2020) (holding DNC and DSCC \nlacked associational standing). Mecinas is inapposite here for a host of reasons. First, a holding \nthat DSCC lacks associational standing is contrary to binding Ninth Circuit precedent, so Mecinas \nholding on DSCC's standing is incorrect. See Democratic Nat’l Comm. v. Reagan, 329 F. Supp. \n3d 824, 831 (D. Ariz. 2018), aff’d, 904 F.3d 686 (9th Cir. 2018), reh’g en banc granted, 911 F.3d \n942 (9th Cir. 2019), rev’d on other grounds and remanded sub nom. Democratic Nat’l Comm. v. \nHobbs, 948 F.3d 989 (9th Cir. 2020) (en banc) (finding plaintiffs, including DSCC and Arizona \nDemocratic  Party,  had  representational  standing  to  challenge  claims  on  behalf  of  Arizona \nDemocratic voters impacted by ballot collection law). Second, Mecinas involved a challenge to a \nballot ordering law where the Court determined no voter would have standing (only candidates), \n \n12 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 89   Filed 06/26/20   Page 19 of 33\n \nbetween Democratic voters in Texas and the apple growers in Hunt is instructive: like the apple \ngrowers in Hunt, Democratic voters in Texas “express their collective views and protect their \ncollective interests” through the Intervenor party committees. Similarly, the Intervenor party \ncommittees are funded by contributions from Democratic voters,4 and their executive ranks are \ncomprised of state and federal representatives, and officials elected to positions within the party \norganizations by the representatives of Democratic voters. Indeed, while Texas is an open primary \nstate as Defendants point out, Texas law provides that a voter who participates in the Democratic \nprimary affiliates with the Party, and the TDP considers that voter to be a member for the voting \nyear. Tex. Elec. Code § 162.003. Moreover, the publicly available charters of both the Democratic \nParty  of  the  United  States  and the  TDP  provide  unequivocally that  anyone  who  considers \nthemselves a Democrat may participate in the parties’ affairs. See Democratic Party of the United \nStates, The Charter & The Bylaws of the Democratic Party of the United States, art. 8 § 1 (“The \nDemocratic Party of the United States shall be open to all who desire to support the Party and who \nwish  to  be  known  as  Democrats.”),  available  at  https://democrats.org/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2018/10/DNC-Charter-Bylaws-8.25.18-with-Amendments.pdf; TDP, The Rules \nof the Texas Democratic Party, art. II(B)(1) (“Any qualified Texas voter 18 years of age or older \nunless otherwise spelled out in these rules who supports the foregoing ‘Statement of Principles’ of \nthe Democratic Party may participate fully in any Party meetings and may be elected to any Party \n                                                            \nMecinas, slip op. at 9-14, and the issue of whether the parties here have standing for candidates is \nnot relevant. Third, the Court noted that the Democratic Party may have standing, id. at 15, but the \nArizona Democratic Party was not a party in Mecinas. Here, by contrast, the TDP is a party, and \nthe TDP has a defined membership by both state law and by its own bylaws. See infra at 13-14. \nMecinas has no relevance to this Court’s inquiry. \n \n4 Indeed, publicly available records on the FEC’s website show that Plaintiff Jarrod Stringer has \ndonated repeatedly to both TDP and DSCC. Maxey Decl. ¶ 24; Schaumburg Decl. ¶ 11. \n13 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 89   Filed 06/26/20   Page 20 of 33\n \nOffice,  except  where  specifically  prohibited  by  law  or  by  Party  Rules.”),  available  at \nhttps://www.texasdemocrats.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/TDP-Rules-4_15_2020.pdf.  \n  It is for these reasons that, contrary to Defendants’ assertions, federal courts nationwide \nhave held that Intervenor party committees, as well as other party committees, have standing to \nrepresent the interests of their voters. See, e.g., Democratic Nat’l Comm. v. Bostelmann, No. 20-\nCV-249-WMC, 2020 WL 1320819, at *3 (W.D. Wis. Mar. 20, 2020) (finding Democratic Party \nof Wisconsin was a membership organization and had standing to sue on behalf of members who \nwould face undue burdens on their right to vote); Democratic Nat’l Comm. v. Reagan, 329 F. Supp. \n3d at 831; Ohio Org. Collaborative v. Husted, 189 F. Supp. 3d 708, 725 (S.D. Ohio), rev’d sub \nnom. on other grounds Ohio Democratic Party v. Husted, 834 F.3d 620, 725 (6th Cir. 2016) \n(finding Ohio Democratic Party established representational standing to bring suit on behalf of \nAfrican-American members); Crawford v. Marion Cty. Election Bd., 472 F.3d 949, 951 (7th Cir. \n2007) (holding “[t]he [Indiana] Democratic Party also has standing to assert the rights of those of \nits members who will be prevented from voting by the new law”), aff’d 553 U.S. 181, 189 n.7 \n(2008) (“We also agree with the unanimous view of those judges that the Democrats have standing \nto challenge the validity of SEA 483 and that there is no need to decide whether the other \npetitioners also have standing.”); Sandusky Cty. Democratic Party v. Blackwell, 387 F.3d 565, \n573-74 (6th Cir. 2004) (holding Ohio Democratic Party had standing to sue on behalf of members \nwho would vote in the upcoming election and whose provisional ballots may be rejected).  \n  Defendants also contend that Intervenors have not identified a specific member who plans \nto renew or change the address on their driver’s license through an online transaction, or has done \nso in the past. ECF No. 78 at 13-14. That is unequivocally false. Ironically, while Intervenors have \nno way of knowing of answering this Court’s question regarding the precise number of voters who \n14 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 89   Filed 06/26/20   Page 21 of 33\n \nhave indicated they wish to apply to register to vote while transacting with DPS online, DPS is \nable to ascertain that information. See ECF No. 69 at 5. But Intervenors are aware that numerous \nDemocratic voters have been injured by Defendants’ conduct, and have identified several of them. \nECF No. 78 at 13-14. Intervenors have maintained throughout this action that they consider the \nindividual plaintiffs in this action to be members. See ECF No. 41-1 at 10; ECF No. 77 at 14; App. \n477 at 15-16 (TDP corporate representative identifying in his deposition the “named Plaintiffs in \nthis lawsuit” as individuals harmed by Defendants’ conduct). However, given that Defendants \nmake this argument again in their motion for summary judgment, Intervenors have attached \ndeclarations stating that they consider each of the individual plaintiffs to be Democratic voters and \nmembers. See Schaumburg Decl. ¶¶ 11-12; Newman Decl. ¶¶ 20-21; Maxey Decl. ¶¶ 20, 23-25; \nsee also Cramer, 931 F.2d at 1025. Consistent with Texas law and the Party charters described \nabove, supra at 13-14, Intervenors consider Mr. Harms to be a member and constituent because \nhe has voted in at least three previous Democratic primary elections, including the most recent \nMarch primary. Maxey Decl. ¶ 23; Schaumburg Decl. ¶ 11; Newman Decl. ¶ 20; Dep. of John \nHarms at 35:6-9. Intervenors consider Mr. Stringer to be a member and constituent because he \nvoted in the March 2020 primary and at least two previous Democratic primary elections; he made \neight contributions to the TDP and three contributions to the DSCC during the 2018 election cycle; \nand he has made contributions to other Democratic candidates and committees. Maxey Decl. ¶ 23; \nSchaumburg Decl. ¶ 11; Newman Decl. ¶ 20. Intervenors consider Ms. Gomez to be a member \nand  constituent  because  she  voted  in  the  March  2020  primary  and  at  least  three  previous \nDemocratic primary elections. Maxey Decl. ¶ 25; Schaumburg Decl. ¶ 11; Newman Declaration ¶ \n20. Ms. Gomez also testified that she was previously employed as the Data Director for TDP. Dep. \nof  Nayeli  Gomez  at  12:2-5.  Furthermore,  Intervenors  consider  Ms.  Thompson,  who  was \n15 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 89   Filed 06/26/20   Page 22 of 33\n \ndisenfranchised by Defendants’ conduct in 2018 and who was not registered to vote at her current \naddress until March 2020—well after the date this lawsuit was filed and the date on which \nIntervenors were granted intervention—to be a member. Maxey Decl. ¶ 20; Schaumburg Decl. ¶ \n12; Newman Decl. ¶ 21. See also California Democratic Party v. Jones, 530 U.S. 567, 574 (2000) \n(holding the First Amendment protects the right of people to associate with a political party, which \n“necessarily presupposes the freedom to identify the people who constitute the association”); \nTashjian v. Republican Party of Conn., 479 U.S. 208, 215 & n.5 (1986) (recognizing “broad \nspectrum of roles” that individuals play in a political party, from those who publicly declare their \nmembership and take on public duties to those who “limit their participation to casting their votes \nfor some or all of the Party’s candidates,” and noting that, with political groups in particular). Each \nof these voters have standing to sue in their own right, and their injuries are not speculative; they \nwere denied the right to vote as a result of Defendants’ conduct.5 \nE.  Defendants’  conduct  harms  the  electoral  prospects  of  Intervenors’ \n  candidates. \n \n  Defendants’ primary counter to Intervenors’ standing based on harm to their candidates’ \nelectoral prospects is that Intervenors have not produced evidence of any such harm. It is worth \nnoting at the outset that the law of seven Circuit Courts of Appeals—including the Fifth Circuit—\nhave uniformly held that harm to electoral prospects constitutes an injury sufficient for Article III \nstanding and does not require the high burden of proof Defendants impose on Intervenors. See Tex. \nDemocratic Party v. Benkiser, 459 F.3d 582 (5th Cir. 2006); see also Green Party of Tenn. v. \n                                                            \n5 Nat'l Council of La Raza v. Cegavske, 800 F.3d 1032, 1041 (9th Cir. 2015) (noting the Summers \nCourt refused to find standing based only on speculation that unidentified members would be \ninjured by a proposed action, but that where it is relatively clear, rather than merely speculative, \nthat one or more members have been or will be adversely affected by a defendant's action, and \nwhere the defendant need not know the identity of a particular member to understand and respond \nto an organization's claim of injury, there is purpose to be served by requiring an organization to \nidentify by name the member or members injured). \n16 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 89   Filed 06/26/20   Page 23 of 33\n \nHargett, 767 F.3d 533, 543-44 (6th Cir. 2014); LaRoque v. Holder, 650 F.3d 777, 786 (D.C. Cir. \n2011); Smith v. Boyle, 144 F.3d 1060, 1061–63 (7th Cir. 1998); Schulz v. Williams, 44 F.3d 48, 53 \n(2d Cir. 1994); Owen v. Mulligan, 640 F.2d 1130, 1132–33 (9th Cir. 1981). \n  That said, Defendants again misstate the record. See ECF No. 78 at 8. Far from a \n“generalized grievance,” Defendants’ conduct makes it more difficult for Intervenors’ members to \nregister to vote at best, and completely disenfranchises them at worse. When Democratic voters \nlike Ms. Thompson or the individual plaintiffs in this action are disenfranchised as a result of \nDefendants’ conduct, they cannot vote for Intervenors’ candidates. For example, Ms. Thompson \nintended to vote for Beto O’Rourke, the 2018 Democratic candidate for U.S. Senate. As a result \nof Defendants’ unconstitutional actions, Ms. Thompson was unable to vote for Mr. O’Rourke, \nharming his electoral prospects. Notably, Senator Ted Cruz defeated Mr. O’Rourke by a margin \nof 50.9 to 48.3 percent in the closest U.S. Senate race in Texas since 1978. Jeremy Wallace, Ted \nCruz’s margin of victory over Beto O’Rourke was even slimmer than we thought, HOUSTON \nCHRONICLE (Dec. 6, 2018), available at https://www.chron.com/politics/texas/article/Ted-Cruz-s-\nmargin-of-victory-over-Beto-13448275.php.  \n  Defendants’ fallback argument is also unconvincing. Defendants ineffectively argue that \neven if Intervenors have produced evidence of electoral harm to their candidates, such harm is a \ngeneralized grievance insufficient for Article III standing. As discussed above, Defendants’ \nposition is directly contrary to law. Further, the cases cited by Defendants on this point are \ninapposite. See ECF No. 78 at 8-9 (citing Gill v. Whitford, 138 S. Ct. 1916, 1933 (2018), and \nJacobson v. Fla Sec’y of State, 957 F.3d 1193, 1206 (11th Cir. 2020)); see also ECF No. 76 at 3 \n(Intervenors’ Reply to Defendants’ Supplemental Brief in Opposition to Intervenors’ Application \nfor Temporary Injunction). Gill found the partisan preferences of a single voter insufficient to grant \n17 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 89   Filed 06/26/20   Page 24 of 33\n \nstanding and never addressed the myriad bases for standing of political parties whose entire raison \nd’etre is to win elections. In fact, on remand to the district court, the Gill plaintiffs sought to cure \ntheir standing issue by filing a new action that included a Democratic Party entity as a plaintiff. \nSee Compl., The Wis. Assembly Democratic Campaign Comm. v. Gill, No. 3:18-cv-763-JPD (W.D. \nWis. Sept. 14, 2018). As to Jacobson, the Eleventh Circuit expressly declined to address injury in \nthe form of harm to electoral prospects, see 957 F.3d at 1206 (declining to decide whether a \npolitical party has standing to challenge an electoral practice that harmed one of its candidate’s \nelectoral prospects in a particular election), as a district court considering this issue recently \nacknowledged when finding the DSCC and DCCC had Article III standing based on harm to their \nelectoral prospects. See Pavek v. Simon, No. 19-cv-3000, 2020 WL 3183249 at *14 n.13. \nF.  Defendants’ conduct caused Intervenors’ injuries. \nDefendants’ “blame the voter” argument on standing—that they are not the cause of \nIntervenors’ injuries for the purposes of Article III—is remarkable and entirely misstates the law \nof Article III standing. The causation necessary for Article III standing does not require a showing \nof proximate cause or that “the defendant’s actions are the very last step in the chain of causation.” \nBennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 169 (1997). Rather, causation for purposes of Article III standing \ncan be demonstrated where it is shown that Defendants’ conduct has a “determinative or coercive \neffect upon the action of someone else.” Id. Defendants’ continued violations have already caused \nthe disenfranchisement of the plaintiffs in Stringer I as well as Ms. Thompson. Defendants’ \nconduct is certain to cause further disenfranchisement in upcoming elections if Defendants are \nnot forced to comply with the law. Intervenors have satisfied Article III’s causation element.6  \n                                                            \n6 An injunction requiring Defendants to comply with the Equal Protection Clause would easily \nsatisfy the low standard for redressability under Article III. To satisfy redressability a plaintiff \n“need only show that a favorable ruling could potentially lessen its injury; it need not definitively \n \n18 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 89   Filed 06/26/20   Page 25 of 33\n \nG.  Intervenors have statutory standing.  \n  Intervenors have already described the numerous problems with Defendants’ baseless \nstatutory standing argument in their Opposition to Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss, ECF No. 71 at \n14-15, and incorporate those arguments herein by reference. Since Defendants’ statutory standing \narguments are identical to those made in their Motion to Dismiss, and are not based on the \nevidence, Intervenors do not brief the issue again here except to note that the Fifth Circuit has \nexpressly  interpreted  Section  1983  to  allow  suits  by  organizations  that  have  established \nassociational standing. Ass’n of Am. Physicians & Surgeons, Inc. v. Tex. Med. Bd., 627 F.3d 547, \n551 (5th Cir. 2010) (nonprofit had standing to assert § 1983 claims on behalf of members in \nseeking prospective declaratory and injunctive relief); see also Church of Scientology of Cal. v. \nCazares, 638 F.2d 1272, 1278 (5th Cir. 1981); Allee v. Medrano, 416 U.S. 802, 819 n.13 (1974); \nJornaleros de Las Palmas v. City of League City, 945 F. Supp. 2d 779, 800 (S.D. Tex. 2013). \nDefendants rely on cases that merely illustrate the general prohibition on individual, third-party \nstanding, but they are inapposite because they do not involve organizations that assert associational \nstanding. As explained above, see supra Section II.C, Intervenors have demonstrated associational \nstanding, which forecloses the Secretary’s “statutory standing” defense, and easily distinguishes \nthis case from the authorities Defendants cite. \nIII.  The doctrine of collateral estoppel precludes Defendants from relitigating the \n  merits of this case. \n \nDefendants’ argument that nonmutual offensive collateral estoppel is inapplicable to this \nlitigation falls flat. While it is true that Intervenors were not a party to Stringer I, see ECF No. 78 \n                                                            \ndemonstrate that a victory would completely remedy the harm.” Sanchez v. R.G.L., 761 F.3d 495, \n506 (5th Cir. 2014). As Intervenors previously noted, this Court’s Final Order in Stringer I would \nmore than adequately address their injuries. See Stringer I, ECF No. 109. Accordingly, Intervenors \nalso satisfy Article III’s redressability requirement.  \n19 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 89   Filed 06/26/20   Page 26 of 33\n \nat 14, participation in the prior action is irrelevant; Defendants’ participation in the previous \nlitigation is what matters, and they had a full and fair opportunity to litigate the equal protection \nclaim. See, e.g., DeLeon v. Lloyd’s London, Certain Underwriters, 259 F.3d 344, 348 (5th Cir. \n2001) (“Although DeLeon was not a party in Tamez, she may still assert offensive, non-mutual \ncollateral  estoppel.”).  Second,  Defendants  point  out  that  Intervenors  are  organizations,  not \nindividuals, and are thus distinct from the plaintiffs in Stringer I. ECF No. 78 at 14. While that \nmay be relevant to Intervenors’ standing—which Defendants have now had a full and fair \nopportunity to litigate, see generally ECF Nos. 58, 78—it does not alter the equal protection \nanalysis in any way. Thus, if anything, the idea that Defendants would have the opportunity to \nrelitigate that their conduct—which they have admitted is entirely unchanged—does not violate \nequal protection is what truly “defies common sense.” ECF No. 78 at 14; see Tr. of Hr’g on Prelim. \nInj., ECF No. 57 at 5:20-23 (Jan. 28, 2020) (“Your Honor, I don’t think that the facts have changed \nmaterially or relevantly since Stringer One, and I think as [Plaintiffs] laid them out, overall we \ndon’t have an objection to their characterization of the process.”); id. at 58:19-21 (“There have \nbeen no material changes with our practices with respect to online driver’s license renewal and \nDPS.”); id. at 59:5-6 (“The practices and law hasn’t changed.”). \nDefendants’ argument that they should get a second bite of the apple to relitigate this case \nis also legally deficient. Defendants seek to distinguish the cases Intervenors rely on, but fail to \naddress or discuss the factors that this Court must consider when determining whether offensive \nnonmutual collateral should apply, which include: (1) the issue under consideration is identical to \nthat litigated in the prior action; (2) the issue was fully and vigorously litigated in the prior action; \n(3) the issue was necessary to support the judgment in the prior case; and (4) there is no special \ncircumstance that would make it unfair to apply the doctrine. United States v. Shanbaum, 10 F.3d \n20 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 89   Filed 06/26/20   Page 27 of 33\n \n305, 311 (5th Cir. 1994). Every single factor favors invoking collateral estoppel here.  \nIV.  Intervenors are entitled to summary judgment for the reasons detailed in \n  Plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment in Stringer I.  \n \nEven if the Court declines to apply the doctrine of collateral estoppel, Intervenors are \nnonetheless entitled to summary judgment for the reasons detailed in Plaintiffs’ Motion for \nSummary Judgment in Stringer I, and Defendants provide no sound argument to the contrary. \nThere is simply no reason for the Court to waste its resources reconsidering a ruling it has already \nmade based on facts that are entirely unchanged.  \nA.  The Anderson/Burdick test applies to the equal protection claims  \n  here, and does not require evidence of intentional      \n  discrimination. \n \n  If  the  Court  were  to  consider,  once  again,  Defendants’  arguments  on  the  merits, \nIntervenors’ equal protection claim is properly evaluated under the legal test derived from \nAnderson v. Celebrezze, 460 U.S. 780 (1983), and Burdick v. Takushi, 504 U.S. 428 (1992). \nDefendants  contend  that  the  Intervenor  political  parties  are  required  to  prove  intentional \ndiscrimination and disproportionate impact on Democrats in order to allege a violation of equal \nprotection. ECF No. 78 at 15-16. This is a misstatement of the law. A claim alleging a violation of \nequal protection in the voting context is properly evaluated under Anderson-Burdick. See, e.g., \nRogers v. Corbett, 468 F.3d 188, 193-94 (3rd Cir. 2006) (“[T]he Anderson test is the proper method \nfor analyzing such equal protection claims due to their relationship to the associational rights found \nin the First Amendment”); Republican Party of Ark. v. Faulkner Co., 49 F.3d 1289, 1293 n. 2 (8th \nCir. 1995) (holding Anderson sets out proper method for balancing both associational and equal \nprotection concerns because “[i]n election cases, equal protection challenges essentially constitute \na branch of the associational rights tree”); Fulani v. Krivanek, 973 F.2d 1539, 1543 (11th Cir. \n1992) (“In this circuit, however, equal protection challenges to state ballot-access laws are \n21 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 89   Filed 06/26/20   Page 28 of 33\n \nconsidered under the Anderson test.”); Rosen v. Brown, 970 F.2d 169, 178 (6th Cir. 1992) \n(“utilizing the Anderson balancing test” in a challenge based on claims of free association and \nequal  protection).  The  Anderson-Burdick  test  requires  courts  to  weigh  “the  character  and \nmagnitude” of the alleged burden, against the “precise interests put forward by the State.” Burdick, \n504 U.S. at 434. It does not require proof of intentional discrimination. \nB.  Defendants cannot satisfy the Anderson-Burdick test. \nIn  the  hopes  of  surviving  Anderson-Burdick  by  securing  lower  scrutiny  for  their \nunconstitutional actions, Defendants wrongly argue that a recent Fifth Circuit decision staying a \npreliminary injunction commands district courts to subject every voting restriction that does not \nresult in total disenfranchisement to rational basis review. ECF No. 78 at 17. Defendants’ proposal \nis wholly inconsistent with the Anderson-Burdick framework, which requires the application of a \nfact-specific balancing test that subjects state action to strict scrutiny when it “subjects the voters’ \nrights to ‘severe’ restrictions.” Burdick, 504 U.S. at 428 (citation omitted). Disenfranchisement is \nnot the only “severe restriction” entitled to a higher level of scrutiny, and under the Anderson-\nBurdick sliding standard, courts have deemed unconstitutional burdens falling short of a complete \ndenial of the right to vote. See, e.g., Harper v. Va. State Bd. of Elections, 383 U.S. 663, 666 (1966); \nObama for Am. v. Husted, 697 F.3d 423, 425 (6th Cir. 2012). Rational basis review is only \nappropriate  when  a  state  election  law  provision  imposes  “reasonable,  nondiscriminatory \nrestrictions” upon the right to vote. Burdick, 504 U.S. at 434. Defendants’ conduct here is far from \nreasonable. \nDefendants also fail to acknowledge that the authority they cite for this standard created \nout of whole cloth, was the decision of a motions panel, which the Fifth Circuit has repeatedly \nstated is not “binding precedent.” Northshore Dev., Inc. v. Lee, 835 F.2d 580, 583 (5th Cir. 1988) \n22 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 89   Filed 06/26/20   Page 29 of 33\n \n(citing Fischer v. United States, 759 F.2d 461, 463 (5th Cir. 1985), and E.E.O.C. v. Neches Butane \nProds. Co., 704 F.2d 144 (5th Cir. 1983)). And even if Defendants were correct that any state \nrestriction on voting short of total disenfranchisement is entitled to rational basis review—and they \nare not—the conduct challenged in this lawsuit has caused the disenfranchisement of Texas voters \nin the past, and Defendants have made it clear that they are willing to disenfranchise voters in the \n2020 elections unless this Court steps in to stop them. See Thompson Decl. ¶ 10; see also Stringer \nv. Whitley, 942 F.3d 715, 726 (5th Cir. 2019) (Ho, J., concurring) (finding Defendants’ conduct \ntook away from plaintiffs “a right they will never be able to recover”). Thus, even under their own \nproposed standard, Defendants’ conduct would be subject to strict scrutiny.  \n  Defendants’ argument about the applicable level of scrutiny is a distraction from their real \nproblem: there is no state interest that justifies Defendants’ conduct. Defendants obfuscate their \ncomplete lack of interest in their differential treatment by asserting interests that are unrelated to \nsignatures on voter registration applications. The Secretary claims, for instance, that requiring a \nwritten signature on voter registration applications helps maintain accurate voter rolls and combat \nvoter fraud, ECF No. 13 at 16, but has admitted that the State does not use the physical, wet-ink \nsignatures for any purpose. See Stringer I, 320 F. Supp. 3d at 873-74, 895, 899. More specifically, \nthe Secretary has admitted that election officials are not expected to, and typically do not, analyze \nor compare wet signatures. Id. Thus the notion that signatures are required on voter registration \napplications—as opposed to using electronic or imaged signatures—advance the State’s interest \nin maintaining accurate voting rolls or preventing fraud is contrived entirely for this lawsuit.7  \n                                                            \n7 Repeating the fiction of widespread voter fraud, even in a court of law, does not make it true—\nas evidenced by the courts that have rejected attempts to limit voting opportunities based on \nsimilarly speculative allegations of voter fraud. See, e.g., People First of Ala. v. Sec’y of State, No. \n20-12184, slip op. at 19 (11th Cir. June 25, 2020) (concluding that state’s “interest for maintaining \nthe photo ID and witness requirements do not outweigh” burdens on voters where evidence \n \n23 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 89   Filed 06/26/20   Page 30 of 33\n \nIndeed, this Court’s analysis in Stringer I provides a complete analysis and rejection of \neach of the contrived state interests Defendants continue to assert. While “Defendants permit \nsimultaneous voter applications for motor voters that renew or change their driver’s license in \nperson or by mail,” they “refuse simultaneous voter applications for motor voters that renew or \nchange their driver's license online,” id. at 899, and Defendants only justification for this difference \ncontinues to be Texas’s signature requirement. ECF No. 78 at 18-19. However, as this Court \ndetermined previously, “neither federal nor state law limits the signature requirement to physical \nhand-written  signatures  on  paper.  Electronic  signatures  and  electronic  records  are  legally \nrecognized and widely used, and Defendants offer no reason for refusing to accept them for online \nmotor voter transactions.” Stringer I, 320 F. Supp. at 899.  \nDefendants’ previous admissions in Stringer I are admissible against them as admissions \nof a party opponent, see Fed R. Evid. 801(2), and Defendants do not and cannot argue that any of \ntheir procedures or facts have changed. See supra Section III. To reiterate what this Court already \nknows and has previously determined, “DPS already uses electronic records and previously \nimaged electronic signatures for every Texan that uses the online system for driver's license \nrenewal or change of address,” Stringer I, 320 F. Supp. at 899; “SOS admits that electronic \nsignatures comply with signature requirements under the NVRA and Texas Election Code,” id.; \n“SOS admits it never uses physical, manual, or wet ink handwritten signatures on paper for voter \nregistration purposes,” id.; “DPS already has, in its possession and control, an electronic signature \nof every motor voter that has been issued a license,” id. at 899-900. Indeed, “with motor voters’ \n                                                            \n“suggests that Alabama has not found itself in recent years to have a significant absentee-ballot \nfraud problem”); Democratic Nat’l Comm. v. Hobbs, 948 F.3d 989, 1036 (9th Cir. 2020) (en banc) \n(rejecting fraud-based justification for ballot collection ban where “[t]here has never been a case \nof voter fraud associated with ballot collection charged in Arizona” (quoting Democratic Nat’l \nComm. v. Reagan, 329 F. Supp. 3d 824, 852 (D. Ariz. 2018))). \n24 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 89   Filed 06/26/20   Page 31 of 33\n \nelectronic signatures already in the voter registration agency's possession, there is no reason why \nDefendants could not register them to vote in a simultaneous online transaction.” Id. at 900. This \nall remains just as true today as it was when this Court originally made these factual findings, and \nDefendants tellingly offer nothing to rebut this. See ECF No. 78 at 18-19.  \nV.  The relief requested by Intervenors is workable. \n  The expedited discovery in this case has made clear that Defendants can take the remaining \nnecessary steps to provide a fully simultaneous, non-duplicative voter registration application to \nvoters who update their driver’s license information online in a matter of weeks. See ECF No. 69 \nat 4-7. And, the cost to Defendants to implement this system is negligible or non-existent. ECF \nNo. 69-1 at 44-45, 53-54 (Stringer II Ingram Dep. at 71:25 – 72:3; 118:2 – 119:20 (“what I said is \nI don’t think it’s going to require a change [to the SOS electronic voter registration database]. . . . \nAnd [if a change is necessary,] the cost won’t be very much, and it will only be a one-time cost, \nbut I just don't know if it's even going to be necessary.”)). It should be clear by this point that, \nwhatever relief is requested, Defendants will claim it is unworkable. But the facts and the record \ndeveloped  in  expedited  relief  show  that  Defendants  could  implement  simultaneous  voter \nregistration quickly and inexpensively. Intervenors reasonably request that injunctive relief be \ngranted here, and Defendants’ continued efforts to place imaginary roadblocks in the way of their \ncompliance with the law is tired and should be rejected.  \nCONCLUSION \n  For the foregoing reasons, Intervenors respectfully ask the Court to grant their Motion for \nSummary Judgment and deny Defendants’ cross-motion for summary judgment. \n \n \n25 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 89   Filed 06/26/20   Page 32 of 33\n \n \nDated: June 26, 2020.

Doc. 91.  Plaintiffs now file this \nsecond  supplement  and  accompanying  declaration  to  confirm  that  the  facts  represented  as \nimminent in prior filings have now come to pass, creating an immediate and time-sensitive need \nfor the requested preliminary injunctive relief. \nAs noted in Plaintiffs’ first supplemental filing, Plaintiffs have pending before this Court a \nrequest for preliminary injunction, for which relief was previously partially granted and partially \nabated. See Plaintiffs’ Emergency Application for Preliminary Injunction, Doc. 5 (Jan. 17, 2020); \nPlaintiffs’ Supplementary Brief in Support of Preliminary Injunction, Doc. 69 (May 13, 2020); \nOrder, Doc. 46 (Jan. 30, 2020). Plaintiffs additionally pointed out that the imminence of injury to \n1 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 96   Filed 08/14/20   Page 2 of 7\n \n \nPlaintiff Stringer is an issue in this case bearing on both standing and eligibility for a preliminary \ninjunction.  While the Court’s Order granting partial injunctive relief to immediately require \nDefendants to register Mr. Stringer to vote addressed his injury at that time, the additional injury \nto Mr. Stringer was imminent based on his clearly-stated intention to move to another new address \nduring the pendency of this suit. In their first supplemental filing Plaintiffs attached a declaration \nof Plaintiff Jarrod Stringer and his accompanying notice of non-renewal of lease, which he \nsubmitted to his landlord on June 18, 2020 as confirmation of his previous testimony of his intent \nto move on or before the end of his current lease, which expires on August 24, 2020. See Doc. 91; \nExcerpts of Apr. 29 Deposition of Jarrod Stringer at 35:6–36:24, Doc. 69-1 at 72-73. \nMr.  Stringer’s  planned  move  has  now  come  to  pass.    In  accordance  with  previous \nrepresentations to the Court, Mr. Stringer is moving on August 15, 2020.  See Exhibit A at ¶ 1 \n(Declaration of Jarrod Stringer of Aug. 14, 2020).  While his new address will remain in the city \nof Houston, his new address is located in different electoral districts than his previous address, \nincluding a move to U.S. Congressional District 18 from U.S. Congressional District 7.  Id. at ¶ \n2.1 In order for Mr. Stringer to vote in the correct electoral districts in the November general \nelection, he must submit his change of address or a new voter registration application to election \nauthorities by October 5, 2020, the voter registration deadline.  TEX. ELEC. CODE § 13.143.  Mr. \nStringer also understands that he is required by law to update his driver’s license to his new address \nby September 14, 2020—30 days after his move.  See Exhibit A at ¶ 4. \n                                                 \n1 Pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 201, Plaintiffs request the Court to take judicial notice of \nthe official United States House of Representatives website used to confirm Plaintiff Stringer’s \nprevious and new congressional districts: United States House of Representatives, Find My \nRepresentative, House.gov (accessed Aug. 13, 2020) https://www.house.gov/representatives/find-\nyour-representative.  \n2 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 96   Filed 08/14/20   Page 3 of 7\n \n \nAccordingly, without immediate injunctive relief, Mr. Stringer will again transact with \nDPS online to update his address, and again be denied his right to simultaneously update his voter \nregistration—an identical injury to that which the Court enjoined in this case related to Mr. \nStringer’s previous address change.

McCraw, in his official capacity as Director of the Texas Department of Public  \nSafety (“DPS”), (“Defendants”), hereby move the Court for summary judgment in their favor on \nall of Plaintiffs’ claims. \nINTRODUCTION \n  This case concerns the application of the National Voter Registration Act (“NVRA”), 52 \nU.S.C. §§20501-20511, to Texas’s online service offerings for licensed drivers in the State.  \nPlaintiffs are three Texas residents who allege that Defendants did not “simultaneously” update \ntheir voter registration information in connection with an online change of address each Plaintiff \nmade to his Texas driver license.  Plaintiffs allege that Defendants have violated the NVRA and \n                                                 \n1 When this lawsuit was filed, Carlos H. Cascos was Texas’s Secretary of State. On January 5, 2017, Rolando Pablos \ntook over this position. Secretary Pablos is therefore now listed as the Defendant in this cause. See FED. R. CIV. P. \n25(d), “[a]n action does not abate when a public officer who is a party in an official capacity dies, resigns, or otherwise \nceases to hold office while the action is pending. The officer’s successor is automatically substituted as a party. Later \nproceedings should be in the substituted party’s name[.]” \n1 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 80   Filed 06/30/17   Page 2 of 25\nthe Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution. They make this claim despite the \nfact  that  no  Plaintiff  provided  a  written,  signed  request  to  update  his  voter  registration \ninformation—as Texas law requires—in connection with his online changes of address.   \nNotably, this is not a case of first impression. NVRA claims related to alleged voter \nregistration delays occurring in the context of online driver license change of address applications \nhave previously been considered and dismissed by Judge Lee Rosenthal and the Fifth Circuit for \nincurably failing to state a claim on which relief could be granted. Broyles v. Texas, 618 F. Supp. \n2d 661, 690 (S.D. Tex. 2009) (dismissing plaintiffs’ claim against the State because they did not \nprovide notice and the alleged voter registration delays did not affect votes in a federal election) \naff’d 381 F. App’x 370 (5th Cir. 2010). The same analysis compels the dismissal of the Plaintiffs’ \nclaims here because they have not complied with the NVRA’s mandatory notice provision. \nMoreover, and any conceivable, non-mooted injury is insufficient to support an actionable NVRA \nclaim because it is undisputed that each Plaintiff is currently registered to vote in upcoming federal \nelections at his current residence.  \nAs discussed below, Plaintiffs’ claims fail as a matter of law for a variety of independent \nreasons. First, Plaintiffs lack statutory standing because it is undisputed that—following their \npurported “notice” letters2 to the State—Defendants offered their assistance in confirming each \nPlaintiffs’ voter registration and assisting any Plaintiff that wanted to update his information. \nSecond, Plaintiffs also lack Article III standing because they cannot establish that their claims are \ntraceable to Defendants’ conduct or redressable. In particular, it is undisputed that all of the \nPlaintiffs have had their voter registration information updated, and each testified that they intend \n                                                 \n2 Mr. Hernandez was individually identified in a May 27, 2015 letter purporting to provide notice. See Doc. 1, Ex. C \nat pp. 2-17 Mr. Stringer and Dr. Woods were not individually identified until Plaintiffs sent additional letters on \nOctober 23, 2015, and November 18, 2015, respectively. Id. at pp. 171-72; 195-96 . The Original Complaint was filed \non March 14, 2016. \n2 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 80   Filed 06/30/17   Page 3 of 25\nto submit the written, signed request required by State law, should he wish to update his voter \nregistration information in the future. Accordingly, Plaintiffs’ claims are moot, and are not subject \nto the capable-of-repetition, but evading review exception to mootness. Third, Plaintiffs claims \nalso fail on their merits as the NVRA expressly incorporates state law into the provisions under \nwhich Plaintiffs assert their claims. And relevant Texas law—which Plaintiffs do not challenge—\nrequires individuals who wish to update their voter registration information to submit a written, \nsigned request to do so. The only exception to this requirement exists in the context of online \nchanges of address for voter registration purposes within a single county, and this exception is \nexpressly provided for by State law. TEX. ELEC. CODE §15.021(d). Plaintiffs’ claims also fail to \nthe extent any non-mooted injury is not related to voting in a federal election. Finally, the equal \nprotection claims fail because Plaintiffs have not—and cannot—identify any similarly-situated \ncomparator who was treated differently when completing the same online change of address \ntransaction. For these reasons, judgment as a matter of law in favor of Defendants is warranted on \nall of Plaintiffs’ claims.  \nSTATEMENT OF RELEVANT UNDISPUTED FACTS \nI.  The Elections Clause of the Constitution Provides the State Authority to Prescribe \nthe Time, Places, and Manner in Conducting Federal Elections. \n \nThe Elections Clause of the United States Constitution provides, “[t]he Times, Places and \nManner of holding Elections for Senators and Representatives, shall be prescribed in each State \nby the  Legislature thereof; but the Congress may  at  any time by  Law make or alter such \nRegulations, except as to the places of chusing Senators.” U.S. CONST. art. I, §4 cl. 1. “The \nElections Clause has two functions. Upon the States it imposes the duty (‘shall be prescribed’) to \nprescribe the time, place, and manner of electing Representatives and Senators; upon Congress it \n3 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 80   Filed 06/30/17   Page 4 of 25\nconfers the power to alter those regulations or supplant them altogether.” Arizona v. Inter Tribal \nCouncil of Arizona, Inc., 133 S. Ct. 2247, 2253 (2013) (citation omitted). \nThis yields States significant latitude, absent specific Congressional directive. Indeed, \n“[t]he Clause’s substantive scope is broad. ‘Times, Places, and Manner,’ [the Supreme Court has] \nwritten, are ‘comprehensive words,’ which ‘embrace authority to provide a complete code for \ncongressional elections,’ including[,]” as relevant here, “regulations relating to ‘registration.’” Id. \nat 2253 (quoting Smiley v. Holm, 285 U.S. 355, 366 (1932)) (citing Roudebush v. Hartke, 405 U.S. \n15, 24–25, (1972) (recounts); United States v. Classic, 313 U.S. 299, 320 (1941) (primaries)). \nII.  Voter Registration in Texas \nThe Defendants each play a part in implementing the NVRA in Texas. TEX. ELEC. CODE \n§31.001(a) (SOS is chief election officer); id. §§20.061 et seq. (DPS is a voter registration \nagency).3 Voter registration in Texas is, and has historically been, a county-based system. TEX. \nELEC. CODE §12.001 (“The county tax assessor-collector is the voter registrar for the county unless \nthe position of county elections administrator is created or the county clerk is designated as the \nvoter registrar.”). DPS and SOS work within this county-based system to implement the NVRA’s \nrequirement that each State “establish procedures to register to vote in elections for Federal office \nby application made simultaneously with an application for a motor vehicle driver’s license \npursuant to [§]20504 of this title.” 52 U.S.C. §20503(a)(1). \nPlaintiffs contend that there are two types of motor vehicle driver license transactions at \nissue in this case: changes of address and renewals; however, it is undisputed that no Plaintiff is \n                                                 \n3 SOS also works with other designated voter registration agencies. See TEX. ELEC. CODE Ch. 20. \nThose agencies are not addressed here because they are not named in this case. \n4 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 80   Filed 06/30/17   Page 5 of 25\nasserting they were injured due to a renewal transaction. Doc. 1, ¶¶ 5, 46, 47, 49. With respect to \nrenewals, the NVRA provides that \n[e]ach State motor vehicle driver’s license application (including any renewal \napplication) submitted to the appropriate State motor vehicle authority under State \nlaw shall serve as an application for voter registration with respect to elections for \nFederal office unless the applicant fails to sign the voter registration application.  \n \n52 U.S.C. §20504(a)(1) (emphasis supplied). \nWith respect to changes of address, the NVRA further provides that \nany change of address form submitted in accordance with State law for purposes of \na State motor vehicle driver’s license shall serve as notification of change of address \nfor voter registration with respect to elections for Federal office for the registrant \ninvolved unless the registrant states on the form that the change of address is not \nfor voter registration purposes. \n \nId. §20504(d) (emphasis supplied).  It is undisputed that under the NVRA in order to be registered \nto vote or submit a change of address, the person must “sign the registration form or attest[] that \nthe change-of-address information is not for voter registration purposes.”  See Doc. 1, ¶ 24. \nThe NVRA also specifies certain “forms and procedures” for voter registration applications \nsubject to the Act. Such applications in connection with DPS transactions may require the \n“minimum amount of information necessary to prevent duplicate voter registrations and enable \nState election officials to assess the eligibility of the applicant and to administer voter registration \nand other parts of the election process.” Id. §20504(c)(2)(B). These applications further “shall \ninclude  a  statement  that—(i)  states  each  eligibility  requirement  (including  citizenship);  (ii) \ncontains an attestation that the applicant meets each such requirement; and (iii) requires the \nsignature of the applicant, under penalty of perjury.” Id. §20504(c)(2)(C)(iii). They may also \nrequire a “second signature.”  Id. §20504(c)(2)(A).   \nCompleted applications “shall be made available (as submitted by the applicant, or in \nmachine readable or other format) to the appropriate State election official as provided by State \n5 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 80   Filed 06/30/17   Page 6 of 25\nlaw.” Id. §20504(c)(2)(E). Information collected in connection with both changes of address and \nonline renewals “shall be transmitted to the appropriate State election official not later than 10 \ndays after the date of acceptance.” Id. §20504(e)(1). \nThe Texas Legislature has provided for NVRA implementation at DPS through in person \nor by mail transactions as follows: \nThe Department of Public Safety shall provide to each person who applies in person \nat the department’s offices for an original or renewal of a driver’s license, a personal \nidentification card, or a duplicate or corrected license or card an opportunity to \ncomplete a voter registration application form. \n \nWhen  the  department  processes  a  license  or  card  for  renewal  by  mail,  the \ndepartment shall deliver to the applicant by mail a voter registration application \nform. \n \nA change of address that relates to a license or card and that is submitted to the \ndepartment in person or by mail serves as a change of address for voter registration \nunless  the  licensee  or  cardholder  indicates  that  the  change  is  not  for  voter \nregistration purposes. \n \nTEX. ELEC. CODE §20.063(a)-(c). \nTexas law further provides, as to in person and by mail transactions only: \nAt the end of each day a [DPS] office is regularly open for business, the manager \nof the office shall deliver by mail or in person to the voter registrar of the county in \nwhich  the  office  is  located  each  completed  voter  registration  application  and \napplicable change of address submitted to a department employee. \n \nEach weekday the department is regularly open for business, the department shall \nelectronically transfer to the secretary of state the name of each person who \ncompletes  a  voter  registration  application  submitted  to  the  department.  The \nsecretary shall prescribe procedures necessary to implement this subsection. \n \nOn the weekday the [SOS] is regularly open for business following the date the \nsecretary receives information under Subsection (b), the secretary shall inform the \nappropriate voter registrar of the name of each person who completes a voter \nregistration application submitted to the department. The registrar may verify that \nthe registrar has received each application as indicated by the information provided \nby the secretary under this subsection. \n \n6 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 80   Filed 06/30/17   Page 7 of 25\nId.  §20.065(a)-(c).  Finally,  Texas  law  further  provides,  as  to  by  mail  and  in  person  DPS \ntransactions only \nIf a person completes a voter registration application as provided by Section 20.063, \nthe Department of Public Safety shall: (1)  input the information provided on the \napplication  into  the  department's  electronic  data  system;  and  (2)    inform  the \napplicant that the applicant's electronic signature provided to the department will \nbe used for submitting the applicant's voter registration application. \n \nId. §20.066(a) (emphasis supplied).   \n \nThus, in the context of by person and by mail  types of applications through DPS, and these \ntypes of applications only, Texas law provides for the applicant to consent to use of an electronic \nsignature in submitting a voter registration application. See TEX. ELEC. CODE § 20.066.  Section \n13.002 of the Texas Election Code, however, still applies to these applications.  It provides, among \nother things, in (b), that “[a] registration application must be in writing and signed by the \napplicant.”  See also Ingram Depo. 97:4-98:5; Schonhoff II Depo. 49:10-14 (“It has to do with \n13.002, which the NVRA grants states the right to come up with procedures for implementing the \nNVRA in its totality.  And that 13.002 is the signature component that [Dr. Hersh] disregards in \nits entirety.”).  For in-person or mail driver license’s applications, an applicant physically signs a \ndocument. Ingram Depo. 99:7-99:24; Schonhoff Depo. 123:24-124:5 (“Q. When an individual \nchanges their address by mail at DPS, does the form they mail in to request that change have to be \nsigned?  A.  Yes.  Under 20.063, if it’s not signed it’s not eligible for registration.  Under 20.066, \nif it’s not signed, then it doesn’t get – then they are not eligible to have the signature transmitted.”’); \nSchonhoff Depo. 119:19-120:15 (“Q.  So I just want to be very clear on the record about what \nhappens in a DPS office in the context of how Mr. Herse is characterizing it in Paragraph 17 here.  \nWhen an individual is in the DPS office and they respond affirmatively to the voter registration \nquestion, how many signatures do they provide and how do they provide those signatures?  A.  \n7 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 80   Filed 06/30/17   Page 8 of 25\nOkay.  So it’s my understanding that they will provide one signature on the DPS application that \nalso serves as a voter registration application.  That is under 13.002.  20.063 allows for that \napplication to be completed in person with the form – combined form for DPS.  The requirements \nare 13.002, which means written and signed at the time that they’re trying to register to vote.  When \nthey turn that form over, then the DPS agent will enter the information on the form provided and \nhave the person sign the keypad or the signature capture pad to provide the physical signature, \nwhich is electronically captured.  Q.  So there are two signatures provided in the DPS office under \nsuch circumstances? A. That’s correct.”)  \nWhile some licensees may renew their license or change their address online, there is no \nspecific  statutory  provision  which  directly  addresses  online  transactions  at  DPS  and  voter \nregistration, but like all voter registrations in Texas (including those in person and by mail at DPS), \nSection 13.002 of the Texas Election Code also applies, and thus in writing, signature requirements \napply.4  Similarly, for change of address forms, the Texas Election Code is very specific that a \nsignature must be provided, with one exception not relevant to any of the Plaintiffs here.  Section \n15.021 of the Texas Election Code provides, in relevant part: \n(a)  If a voter discovers incorrect information on the voter's registration certificate or if any \nof the information becomes incorrect because of a change in circumstances, the voter shall \npromptly submit to the registrar a written, signed notice of the incorrect information and \nthe corresponding correction. \n… \n(d)  A voter who continues to reside in the county in which the voter is registered may \ncorrect information under this section by digital transmission of the information under a \nprogram  administered  by  the  secretary  of  state  and  the  Department  of  Information \nResources. \n(e)  The secretary of state shall adopt rules to: (1) approve technologies for submitting \nchanges of registration information by digital transmission under this section; and (2)  \n                                                 \n4 As an example, an applicant for voter registration may fax his or her application for registration under 13.002 and \n13.143 (d-2) of the Texas Election Code, but the original must follow by mail, thereby maintaining the requirement \nthat there be a physical signature.  See TEX. ELEC. CODE §§ 13.002; 13.143(d-2); Schonhoff Depo. 53:4-6 (“There’s \na fax option, but the original has to come by mail, which leads to an original signature.”) \n8 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 80   Filed 06/30/17   Page 9 of 25\nprescribe  additional  procedures  as  necessary  to  implement  a  system  for  the  digital \ntransmission of changes in registration information. \n \n(emphasis supplied).  Therefore, Texas law only permits in county changes of address, which do \nnot relate to any allegation by the Plaintiffs, to be transmitted without a signature; out of county \nchanges of address like those alleged by the Plaintiffs must be in writing and signed. \nOnline renewal and changes of address with DPS are permitted if, among other things, the \napplicant is a U.S. Citizen with a Social Security number on file who most recently renewed in \nperson. Importantly, it is undisputed that there is no physical signature provided by the individual \nat the time the voter completes an online change of address or renewal transaction with DPS, unlike \nas there is for in person or by mail transactions with DPS.  Moreover, there is no such language in \nthe Texas Election Code relating to consent to use of an electronic signature for transactions \nconducted online with DPS, unlike as there is for in person or by mail transactions with DPS. \nIngram  Depo.  99:25-100:3  (“In  an  online  transaction,  there  is  no  physical  signature  made, \nelectronically captured or otherwise.”). Because Texas.gov’s online interface does not capture an \nimage of a voter’s signature, those who utilize it receive a link to a voter registration application \nthey must print, sign and mail in order to update their voter registration. Compare Doc. 1, Ex. A \nat p. 2 (“Selecting ‘yes’ does not register you to vote. A link to the [SOS] voter website (where a \nvoter application may be downloaded or requested) will be available on your receipt page.”) \n(emphasis original) with id., Ex. D. at p. 25 (voter registration application requiring signature). See \nalso, e.g., TEX. ELEC. CODE §§ 13.002; 15.021; 52 U.S.C. §20504(c)(2)(C)(iii) (voter registration \napplications must be signed); id. §20504(c)(2)(A) (applications may require second signature); id. \n§20504(a)(1) (renewal is not for voter registration purposes if applicant “fails to sign the voter \nregistration application” or  does not meet other State requirements).  The primary purpose of these \nsignatures is to comply with requirements for registration, although physical signatures may be \n9 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 80   Filed 06/30/17   Page 10 of 25\nused in the context of verifying signatures on absentee ballots.  See Schonhoff Depo. 101:3 – 15; \n102:20-21 (“The primary purpose of the signature is registration.”) \nIII.  Plaintiffs’ Allegations \nA.  Plaintiffs can present no evidence that they completed the steps that Texas law \nrequires of any individual who wishes to update voter registration information.  \n \nPlaintiffs are three Texas residents who allege that they completed online transactions in \n2014 or 2015 on Texas.gov to change the address on their driver licenses. Doc. 1, ¶¶ 46-47, 49. At \nthat time, the Texas.gov interface contained a box asking the driver license holder whether they \nwanted to register to vote or update their voter registration information. Doc. 1, Ex. A at p. 2. The \nTexas.gov interface further made clear that “[s]electing ‘yes’ does not register you to vote. A link \nto the [SOS] voter website (where a voter application may be downloaded or requested) will be \navailable on your receipt page.” Id. No Plaintiff has alleged or provided evidence that he completed \nthe SOS voter application. See, e.g., Doc. 1, ¶¶ 46-49; Hernandez Depo. 28:16-28:19; Stringer \nDepo. 32:2-32:19; Woods Depo. 55:14-55:16.  \nB.  Plaintiff Woods has not been denied the ability to cast a vote in a federal election, each \nPlaintiff is registered to vote at his desired address, and no Plaintiff was denied the \nopportunity to cast ballot in the 2016 federal general election. \n \nPlaintiffs bring this action based on particular driver license changes of address made \nthrough Texas.gov, each in connection with a particular move.  Hernandez moved in 2013 from \nEctor to Dallas County. Hernandez Depo. 28:16-22. Stringer moved from Tarrant to Bexar County \nin August 2014. Stringer Depo. 31:1-31:8. In 2015, Woods moved from West Virginia to Houston, \nTexas and changed his driver’s license address from an old address in Austin to his new address \nin Houston.  Woods Depo. 62:11-63:9. None of the Plaintiffs renewed his driver license in \nconnection with these moves. See Hernandez Depo. 28:16-28:19; Stringer Depo. 32:2-32:19; \nWoods Depo. 55:14-55:16.  \n10 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 80   Filed 06/30/17   Page 11 of 25\nHernandez alleges that he was forced to cast a provisional ballot in a 2014 election. Doc. \n1, ¶46. Likewise, Stringer alleges that he could only vote for state and local ballot questions in a \n2014 election. Id.  On the other hand, Woods only brings this cause of action based upon a non-\nfederal 2015 election. Id. at ¶ 49; see also Ex. C (Answer to Request for Admission # 15).  \nPlaintiffs purported to provide the State with pre-suit “notice” of their alleged claims. \nDefendants offered assistance to each Plaintiff (and any other individual with voter registration \nquestions  of  whom  Plaintiffs  or  their  counsel  was  aware)—including  to  confirming  voter \nregistration status, assisting with updating voter registration information, and answering any other \nquestions about the voter registration process.  See Exs. A, B, C (Answers to Requests for \nAdmission #9). See also, e.g., Doc. 1 Ex. C at 27-28; 45. Today,  as was the case prior to the end \nof the “notice period, each Plaintiff is registered to vote at the address where he wishes to be \nregistered, and each was able to cast a ballot in the 2016 federal general election. See Stringer \nDepo. 48:2-7; Woods depo. 72:22-74:11; Hernandez depo. 39:4-9; Ex. I (Hernandez TEAM \nRecord, showing an Effective Date of Registration of December 14, 2014 and voting history for \nMarch and November 2016; Stringer TEAM Record, showing an Effective Date of Registration \nof May 23, 2015 and voting history for March and November 2016, and Woods TEAM Record, \nshowing an Effective Date of Registration of December 3, 2015 and voting history for March and \nNovember 2016). \nFurther, no Plaintiff alleges that, should he move in the future, he will fail to submit a \nwritten, signed request to update his voter registration information, should he wish to update it. \nSee Hernandez Depo. 39:10-15; Stringer Depo. 49:1-49:9; Woods Depo. 74:12-75:7. \nEXHIBITS \n11 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 80   Filed 06/30/17   Page 12 of 25\n  In support of this motion, Defendants rely on the evidence identified and contained in the \nattached appendix, all of which is incorporated herein by reference as if set forth in full. \nExhibit   Description \nA  Plaintiff Hernandez’s Responses to Defendants’ First Set of Discovery \nB  Plaintiff Stringer’s Responses to Defendants’ First Set of Discovery \nC  Plaintiff Woods’s Responses to Defendants’ First Set of Discovery \nD  Plaintiff Hernandez’s Deposition Excerpts (“Hernandez Depo.”) \nE  Plaintiff Stringer’s Deposition Excerpts (“Stringer Depo.”) \nF  Plaintiff Woods’s Deposition Excerpts (“Woods Depo.”) \nG  Keith Ingram’s Rule 30(b)(6) Deposition Excerpts (“Ingram Depo.”) \nH  Betsy Schonhoff Expert Deposition Excerpts (“Schonhoff Depo.”) \nI  Plaintiffs’ TEAM Records (filed separately under seal) \n \nARGUMENT \nI.  Legal Standard for Summary Judgment \n \nSummary judgment is appropriate if no genuine issue of material fact exists and the moving \nparty is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. See Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323 \n(1986). For this analysis, the evidence is examined in the light most favorable to the nonmovant. \nColson v. Grohman, 174 F.3d 498, 506 (5th Cir. 1999). But “[w]here critical evidence is so weak \nor tenuous on an essential fact that it could not support a judgment in favor of the nonmovant, or \nwhere it is so overwhelming that it mandates judgment in favor of the movant, summary judgment \nis appropriate.” Alton v. Texas A&M Univ., 168 F.3d 196, 199 (5th Cir. 1999). “If the record as a \nwhole could not lead a rational jury to find for the nonmoving party, there is no genuine issue for \ntrial and summary judgment is warranted.” Wheeler v. Miller, 168 F.3d 241, 247 (5th Cir. 1999).  \nII.  Plaintiffs Have Not Established Standing for Any of Their Claims. \nA.  Plaintiffs lack statutory standing, because Defendants addressed all of their voter \nregistration concerns once aware of them.  \n \n12 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 80   Filed 06/30/17   Page 13 of 25\nAs an initial matter, Plaintiffs lack standing because it is undisputed that, during the notice \nperiod, Defendants took action to correct any alleged voter registration issue each Plaintiff had.  \nCongress’s abrogation of Defendants’ immunity is conditioned on a plaintiff’s compliance \nwith the NVRA’s notice provision. 52 U.S.C. §20510(b)(1)-(2). The statute provides, in relevant \npart, that before a plaintiff can file suit, he or she must “provide written notice of the violation to \nthe chief election official of the State involved.” Id.  “[T]he purpose of the notice requirement was \nto  ‘provide  states...an  opportunity  to  attempt  compliance  before  facing  litigation.’”  Scott  v. \nSchedler, 771 F.3d 831, 835-36 (5th Cir. 2014) (quoting ACORN v. Miller, 129 F.3d 833, 838 (6th \nCir.1997)) (alterations in Scott). A state then has 90 days to attempt to correct the violation. 52 \nU.S.C. §20510(b)(1)-(2).5 Critically, a plaintiff does not have standing to sue if the alleged \nviolation is corrected during the notice period. Id.; Scott, 771 F.3d at 836. \nIn determining what action a state can take to correct an alleged violation, the Fifth \nCircuit’s decision in Scott is instructive. There, the NCAAP and an individual plaintiff (Scott) \nalleged  that  Louisiana  public  assistance  offices  were  committing  systemic  and  continuing \nviolations of NVRA in handling responses to the voter registration question on applications for \npublic benefits. Scott, 771 F.3d at 833. Prior to suit, the NCAAP provided notice of the alleged \nviolations, but Scott’s name was not included in the notice. Id. at 835. As a result, the Fifth Circuit \nruled that Scott could not piggyback on the NCAAP’s notice and establish standing in his own \nright. Id. at 836. Critically, in finding that Scott lacked standing, the Court noted that when \nLouisiana was provided notice of Scott’s allegation, it “attempted to provide Scott with voter \nregistration forms” and that this attempt was “‘exactly’” what the “‘pre-litigation notice was meant \nto encourage.’” Id. (quoting Ga. State Conf. of NAACP v. Kemp, 841 F.Supp.2d 1320, 1336 (N.D. \n                                                 \n5 A shorter notice period of 20 days applies where a plaintiff alleges that a violation that took place within 120 days \nof a federal election. 52 U.S.C. § 20510(b)(2). \n13 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 80   Filed 06/30/17   Page 14 of 25\nGa. 2012)).  Ultimately, the Fifth Circuit held that due to his failure to comply with the NVRA’s \nnotice provision  he lacked standing to seek relief for himself or “for others, either.” Id. \nThe same rationale defeats Plaintiffs’ standing here.  They lack standing for the simple fact \nthat each Plaintiffs’ alleged voter registration issues6 were corrected prior to the end of the notice \nperiod. See Ex. I (Hernandez TEAM Record, showing an Effective Date of Registration of \nDecember 14, 2014; Stringer TEAM Record, showing an Effective Date of Registration of May \n23, 2015, and Woods TEAM Record, showing an Effective Date of Registration of December 3, \n2015).   Indeed, this fact is undisputed—each Plaintiff admits that Defendants offered to confirm \nhis voter registration status, and assist in updating his voter registration information. See Exs. A, \nB, C (at Requests for Admission #9); see also Doc. 1, Ex. C. Further, each Plaintiff is currently \nregistered to vote at his desired location and was able to vote in the 2016 federal general election. \nSee  Exs.  A  (Request  for  Admission  #17),  B  Request  for  Admission  #17),  C  (Request  for \nAdmission #16); Stringer Depo. 48:2-7; Woods Depo. 72:22-74:11; Hernandez Depo. 39:4-9; Ex. \nI. As multiple courts have held, this type of voter registration assistance is “exactly” what the \nNVRA “pre-litigation notice was meant to encourage.” Scott, 771 F.3d at 836 (citation omitted). \nPlaintiffs concede that Defendants attempted to verify the voter registration status and \nupdate the voter registration information of each Plaintiff. See Exs. A, B, C (Requests for \nAdmission #9). Yet, Plaintiffs continue to claim standing based on the allegation that the parties \nhave  a  larger  disagreement  about  what  the  NVRA  requires,  which  Plaintiffs  claim  affects \nthousands of non-parties. Doc. 9, p. 20. But this argument conflicts with Fifth Circuit’s analysis in \nScott, where the state’s issuance of a voter registration form in response to an individual’s \npurported claim was exactly the type of action that would correct a violation under the notice \n                                                 \n6 Although for the reasons explained herein, those issues were not the result of violations of the NVRA in any event. \n14 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 80   Filed 06/30/17   Page 15 of 25\nprovision, despite the fact that it arose in the context of a larger dispute about the NVRA’s \nrequirements. 771 F.3d at 836. And Plaintiffs have not brought this suit through an organization \nthat has standing to assert claims on behalf of others. As a result, under Scott, Plaintiffs’ contention \nthat other voters will be affected by the State’s interpretation of the NVRA under State law is \ninsufficient to confer statutory standing. If an individual plaintiff does not have standing under the \nnotice provision to seek relief for himself, “he is not entitled to seek relief for others, either.” Id.  \nAccordingly, Plaintiffs’ claims lack standing under the NVRA’s notice provision.  \nB.  Plaintiffs lack Article III standing. \nPlaintiffs also cannot establish the Court’s subject-matter jurisdiction because they cannot \nestablish standing under Article III of the United States Constitution. To establish Article III \nstanding, a plaintiff must show: (1) an injury-in-fact; (2) that is traceable to the defendant’s \nchallenged conduct (causation); and (3) that is likely to be redressed by a favorable decision in the \ndistrict court (redressability). Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Envtl. Servs., Inc., 528 U.S. \n167, 180–81 (2000); see also Tex. Democratic Party v. Benkiser, 459 F.3d 582, 585–86 (5th Cir. \n2006). These elements are “an indispensable part of the plaintiff’s case.” Lujan v. Defs. of Wildlife, \n504 U.S. 555, 561 (1992). The party seeking to invoke federal jurisdiction bears the burden of \nestablishing all three elements. Id. If a party lacks standing to bring a claim, the court lacks subject-\nmatter jurisdiction over that claim. See Crane v. Johnson, 783 F.3d 244, 251 (5th Cir. 2015). Here, \nthe Plaintiffs lack standing because they have established neither causation nor redressability. \n1.  Plaintiffs’ injuries are not fairly traceable to any Defendant’s conduct, but are \ninstead the result of their own behavior. \n \nHere it is undisputed that no Plaintiff submitted a written, signed request to update his voter \nregistration information when changing the address on his Texas driver license using Texas.gov, \nas asserted in the Complaint. As a result, the alleged injuries related to their voter registration status \n15 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 80   Filed 06/30/17   Page 16 of 25\nor their rights under the NVRA—which requires covered voter registration applications to conform \nto applicable state law—is traceable not to Defendants’ conduct, but rather to their own inaction. \nAs a result, Plaintiffs’ alleged injuries do not satisfy the causation element necessary to establish \nArticle III standing. See Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560 (for an injury-in-fact to be fairly traceable to the \nchallenged action of the defendant, “there must be a causal connection between the injury and the \nconduct complained of.”); Westfall v. Miller, 77 F.3d 868, 871-73 (5th Cir. 1996) (injury stemming \nfrom plaintiff’s own inaction severs causal link between that injury and any conduct of defendant). \n2.  Plaintiffs’ claims are moot. \nFurther, Plaintiffs claims are moot. Mootness is “the doctrine of standing in a time frame.” \nCtr. for Individual Freedom v. Carmouche, 449 F.3d 655, 661 (5th Cir. 2006). If the controversy \nbetween a plaintiff and defendant has been “resolved to the point that they no longer qualify as \nadverse parties with sufficient legal interests to maintain the litigation,” a court lacks jurisdiction. \nStauffer v. Gearhart, 741 F.3d 574, 582 (5th Cir. 2014). That is, “[t]he requisite personal interest \nthat must exist at the commencement of litigation (standing) must continue throughout its existence \n(mootness).”United States Parole Comm’n v. Geraghty, 445 U.S. 388, 397 (1980). Federal courts \n“have no power under Article III to decide the merits of a case that is moot when it comes before” \nthem. Goldin v. Bartholow, 166 F.3d 710, 718 (5th Cir. 1999). A “controversy becomes moot \nwhere, as a result of intervening circumstances, there are no longer adverse parties with sufficient \nlegal interests to maintain the litigation.” Perschall v. Louisiana, 174 F.3d 197 (5th Cir. 1999) \n(citation omitted).  \nHere, it is undisputed that Plaintiffs are currently registered to vote at their desired \naddresses, and intend to make future updates to their voter registration in accordance with Texas \nlaw. As a result, their claims are moot and not capable of repetition. \n16 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 80   Filed 06/30/17   Page 17 of 25\ni.  There is no current controversy with any Plaintiff, because it is undisputed \nthat each is currently registered to vote at his desired address.  \n \nPlaintiffs’ deposition testimony establishes that each is currently registered to vote at his \ndesired address. Further, while Plaintiffs contend that their voter registration status has affected \ntheir ability to vote in previous elections, those elections have passed.  Dep’t of Tex., Veterans of \nForeign Wars v. Tex. Lottery Comm’n, 760 F.3d 427, 432 (5th Cir. 2014) (For an injury to be \nredressable, a plaintiff must show that a favorable decision would likely remedy it). In addition, in \nresponse to Plaintiffs’ pre-suit notice, Defendants offered assistance to Plaintiffs and worked to \nprovide information to allow  for the correction the alleged violations as to the specific parties and \nPlaintiffs were able to, and in fact did, cast a ballot in the 2016 federal election. See Exs. A, B, C, \nI. In fact, each Plaintiff was registered at his desired address during or prior to the notice period.  \nStringer Depo. 48:2-7; Woods Depo. 72:22-74:11; Hernandez Depo. 39:4-9; Ex. I. As a result, \nPlaintiffs lack the personal interest in this suit required to establish a case or controversy. \nii.  Because there is no competent evidence these Plaintiffs’ alleged injury will \nrecur, the capable-of-repetition exception to mootness is inapplicable.   \n \nA moot case may still be justiciable, if the underlying dispute is “capable of repetition, yet \nevading review.” Spencer v. Kemna, 523 U.S. 1, 17-18 (1998) (citations omitted).  This exception \napplies “only in exceptional situations.” Id. In the absence of a class action, a controversy is \ncapable of repetition, yet evading review where both of the following two requirements are met: \n“(1) the challenged action [is] in its duration too short to be fully litigated prior to its cessation or \nexpiration, and (2) there [is] a reasonable expectation that the same complaining party [will] be \nsubjected to the same action again.” Weinstein v. Bradford, 423 U.S. 147, 149 (1975) (per curiam). \n Here, there is no reasonable expectation that any Plaintiff will suffer any injury alleged \nhere in the future. Indeed, each Plaintiff testified that in the future, if he had to change addresses, \n17 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 80   Filed 06/30/17   Page 18 of 25\nhe planned to update his voter registration by submitting a signed, written request to do so. \nHernandez Depo. 39:10-15; Stringer Depo. 49:1-9; Woods Depo. 74:12-75:7. And this is precisely \nwhat Texas law requires. See, e.g., Tex. Elec. Code § 13.002(b); Tex. Elec. Code § 20.066; Tex. \nElec. Code §15.021.  \nAccordingly, whether Plaintiffs’ claims fall under the capable-of-repetition exception to \nmootness  depends  upon  how  the  Court  applies  the  “same  complaining  party”  requirement. \nDefendants note that this issue presents the Court with a cluttered canvas. 7 In election cases, the \nFifth Circuit has required that the same complaining party have a reasonable expectation that they \nwill face the same injury again. See Smith v. Winter, 782 F.2d 508, 510 (5th Cir. 1986) (election \nlaw challenge held moot because elected officials prevailed in recall election at ballot box). In \ncertain circumstances it has expanded the complaining party requirement to encompass likely \ninjuries to non-parties. See Ctr. For Individual Freedom v. Carmouche, 449 F.3d 655, 662 (5th \nCir. 2006); Kucinich v. Tex. Democratic Party, 563 F.3d 161, 164 (5th Cir. 2009). That said, \nWinter, as the earliest of the cited Fifth Circuit decisions, controls and requires the dismissal of \nPlaintiffs’ suit on standing grounds. See, e.g., Rios v. City of Del Rio, Tex., 444 F.3d 417, 425 n.8 \n(5th Cir. 2006) (stating rule of orderliness). \n                                                 \n7 Like the Fifth Circuit, other courts have also struggled to reconcile the Supreme Court’s capable-of-repetition \ninstructions in election cases. For example, the Second Circuit in Van Wie v. Pataki, 267 F.3d 109, 114 (2d Cir. 2001), \nnoted the “tension” in Supreme Court election cases applying the second prong of the capable-of-repetition exception. \n267 F.3d 109, 114 (2d Cir. 2001) (comparing Norman v. Reed, 502 U.S. 279, 288 (1992) (examining whether the \n“same parties” would face similar, future injury); Ill. State Bd. of Elections v. Socialist Workers Party, 440 U.S. 173, \n187-88 (1979); with Storer v. Brown, 415 U.S. 724, 737 n.8 (1974) (finding that the case was not moot post-election \nchallenge to state law regarding candidate eligibility was not moot because challenged law's \"effects on independent \ncandidacies[] will persist as [they] are applied in future elections.\"); Rosario v. Rockefeller, 410 U.S. 752, 756 n.5 \n(1973); Dunn v. Blumstein, 405 U.S. 330, 333 n.2 (1972)).  \n \nUltimately, the Second Circuit “adopted” approach of the Supreme Court’s election cases that hold “that, in the \nabsence of a class action, there must be a reasonable expectation that the same complaining party would encounter the \nchallenged action in the future.” Van Wie, 267 F.3d at 114 (emphasis in original). In light of the same cases, and the \nFifth Circuit’s decision in Smith v. Winter, 782 F.2d 508, 510 (5th Cir. 1986), Defendants would urge the Court to \nadopt the same approach here and focus the second prong solely the likelihood of the same injury on the same \ncomplaining parties.  \n18 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 80   Filed 06/30/17   Page 19 of 25\nIn Winter, the plaintiffs were elected officials who were subjected to recall elections under \nMississippi law. 782 F.2d at 509. They alleged the defendants’ actions and a state statute violated \nthe Voting Rights Act and their constitutional rights. Id. The plaintiffs ultimately prevailed in their \nelections before the case was decided. Id. at 510. As a result, the court found that their claims were \nproperly dismissed as moot. Id. In examining whether plaintiffs met the second prong of the \ncapable-of-repetition exception to mootness, the Fifth Circuit focused solely on whether the same \nplaintiffs established whether they would be subjected to the same action again, and held that the \n“second prong does not apply because there is no allegation or showing otherwise that [the \nplaintiffs] will be subjected to another recall petition.” Id.  To the extent Winter conflicts with any \nsubsequent panel’s decision, Winter’s analysis should control under Fifth Circuit precedent, and \nrequires dismissal of Plaintiffs’ claims in this case for lack of Article III standing.  \nIII.  Plaintiffs’ Claims Fail on the Merits. \n \nPlaintiffs’ NVRA and equal protection claims also fail on their merits, as they ignore or \nmisunderstand key provisions of both federal and state law. First, the NVRA provisions at issue \nincorporate Texas law by requiring that driver license applications and changes of address covered \nunder the Act must also comply with applicable state law. 52 U.S.C. §§20504(a)(1), 20504(d) the \nNVRA further requires that such applications be signed. Id. §20504(c)(2)(C)(iii). Texas law also \nrequires a voter registration application to be signed. TEX. ELEC. CODE §13.002(b), and only \nprovides for the transmission of an electronic signature when there is also an accompanying \nphysical signature, and in the case of DPS, only for in-person or by mail applications.  See TEX. \nELEC. CODE §§ 20.063; 20.066.  Texas law also requires out-of-county changes of address to be in \nwriting and signed.  TEX. ELEC. CODE § 15.021.  But, driver license’s renewal or change of address \ntransactions done online are not physically signed. As a result, in an online transaction, Texas law \n19 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 80   Filed 06/30/17   Page 20 of 25\nthat requires a driver license applicant who also wishes to register to vote sign and submit a voter \nregistration application. \nSince the relevant section of the NVRA requires the application to be completed in \naccordance with state law, compliance with Texas law is part and parcel of the NVRA. Further, to \nthe extent that any Plaintiff’s NVRA claim is based on an injury in a non-federal election, it fails \na matter of law because the NVRA is limited to challenges by voters harmed in the context of a \nfederal election.  Finally, Plaintiffs’ equal protection claim also fails because they have not—and \ncannot—identify  any  Texas  residents  who  filled  out  a  driver’s  license  change  of  address \napplication online, and were treated differently by the State.  \nA.  Plaintiffs’ NVRA claims fail as a matter of law. \n \n1.  Plaintiffs’  cannot  establish  a  violation  of  the  NVRA  because  the  signature \nrequirement at issue is within the State’s prerogative under the Election Clause \nand do not violate the NVRA. \n \nAs explained above, Texas law requires that voter registration applications “must be in \nwriting and signed by the applicant.” TEX. ELEC. CODE § 13.002(b); Schonhoff Depo. 102:20-21. \nThe same is true of out of county address changes. TEX. ELEC. CODE §15.021. In compliance with \nthe NVRA, Texas provides a voter registration application as part of an application for a motor \nvehicle driver’s license when a voter indicates that he or she wishes to register to vote. For in-\nperson or mail driver license applications, an applicant physically signs the application. Ingram \nDepo. 99:7-99:24; Schonhoff Depo. 123:24-124:5; 119:19-120:15.  \nIn the context of these types of applications, and these types of applications only, Texas \nlaw provides that the applicant may consent to the use of his electronic signature for purposes of \nsubmitting a voter registration application. See TEX. ELEC. CODE §§ 20.063, 20.066. But, unlike \nan in-person or by mail driver license application, an online applicant does not physically—or \n20 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 80   Filed 06/30/17   Page 21 of 25\nelectronically—sign a renewal or change of address driver license application. Ingram Depo. \n99:25-100:3; see also TEX. ELEC. CODE §§ 20.063; 20.066 (applying only to in person and by mail \ntransactions, and referring to consent that an electronic signature be transmitted); Ingram Depo. \n97:4-98:5; Schonhoff  Depo. 49:10-14. \nAs a result, to comply with §§13.002 and 15.021 of the Texas Election Code, online driver \nlicense transactions in which an applicant wants to register to vote are linked to a voter registration \napplication that the applicant has the opportunity to sign and submit. These procedures are \nconsistent both with the relevant State statutes, and the NVRA. See 52 U.S.C. §§20504(c)(2)(B) \n(State’s voter registration application may include information needed to “enable State election \nofficials to assess the eligibility of the applicant and to administer voter registration and other parts \nof  the  election  process.);  20504(c)(2)(C)(iii)  (application  must  require  the  signature  of  the \napplicant,  under  penalty  of  perjury);  20504(c)(2)(A)  (applications  may  require  a  “second \nsignature”); TEX. ELEC. CODE §§13.002, 15.021, 20.063, 20.066.  \nNevertheless,  Plaintiffs  claim  that  the  NVRA  required  Texas  to  update  their  voter \nregistration information “simultaneously” with their online requests to change the addresses on \ntheir driver licenses, and further claim that Texas violated the law by requiring them to submit a \nphysical signature when requesting a change to their voter registration information. Doc. 1, ¶¶2, \n26, 39.8  Plaintiffs erroneously claim that “the exact same information is submitted online” as is \nsubmitted by an individual updating or renewing their driver license in person, notwithstanding \nthe clear difference that an individual updating or renewing in person (or for that matter, by mail) \n                                                 \n8 Notably, no Plaintiff has claimed he attempted to renew a a Texas driver license online in \nconnection with the allegations in this case. See Doc. 1, ¶¶46-49. Thus, Defendants re-urge and \nincorporate by reference the arguments raised in their Motion to Dismiss, that the Court lacks \njurisdiction to consider online driver license renewals under the NVRA. Doc. 7. \n21 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 80   Filed 06/30/17   Page 22 of 25\nis providing a physical signature at that time. See Doc. 1 ¶ 43. And they make this claim despite \nthe fact that §20504 explicitly does not apply if the “applicant fails to sign the voter registration \napplication” as is undisputedly the case here. 52 U.S.C. §20504(a)(1).  \n Plaintiffs  would  further  have  states  treat  all  “driver’s  license  change-of-address \ntransactions as updates for voter registration purposes,” even where the applicant “states on the \nform that the change of address is not for voter registration purposes.” Compare Doc. 1, Count III \n(capitalization altered) with 52 U.S.C. §20504(d). The NVRA imposes no such requirement. Scott, \n771 F.3d at 831-40 (Louisiana did not violate the NVRA by informing applicant in NVRA-covered \ntransaction that, if they answered “no” to voter registration question, they would not be registered \nto vote, even where Louisiana did not provide voter registration application to applicants who \nanswered “no”). \nAccordingly, judgment as a matter of law is warranted on Plaintiffs’ NVRA claim. \n2.  Plaintiffs’ claims fail to the extent they do not establish an injury connected to a \nfederal election. \n \nPlaintiffs’ NVRA claims should also be dismissed to the extent they are not premised on \nviolations made in the context of a federal election. In particular, Woods should be dismissed from \nthe suit because he has not suffered the type of injury that can maintain a claim under the NVRA. \nRather, the NVRA by its own “terms applies to voters registrations for ‘elections for Federal \noffice.’” 52 U.S.C. §20504(a)(1)(emphasis added). Conversely, the federal statute does not apply \nto state or local elections as the authority to regulate federal elections “does not give Congress the \npower to directly regulate state voter registration procedures in state elections or state ballot \nissues.” Dobrovolny v. Nebraska, 100 F. Supp. 2d 1012, 1028 (D. Neb. 2000). Here, Woods’s \nclaims fail as a matter of law because he cannot show that the alleged violation impacted his \nparticipation in a federal election. \n22 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 80   Filed 06/30/17   Page 23 of 25\nNotably, this is not the first time a court has dismissed allegations that online driver license \ntransactions in Texas violate 52 U.S.C. §20504. Both Judge Rosenthal and the Fifth Circuit \nconsidered this issue in Broyles. There, the plaintiffs alleged the State violated the NVRA when \none of the plaintiffs “changed his driver’s license and updated his voter registration on the DPS \nwebsite” in 2007 but did not receive an updated voter registration card and therefore was not \neligible to vote in a 2008 local election. Broyles, 618 F. Supp. 2d at 678. Judge Rosenthal noted \nthat the NVRA claim failed because plaintiffs did not timely provide pre-suit notice, divesting \nthem of standing to maintain a private right of action. Id. at 691 (“If notice was optional, the 90-\nday cure period would be superfluous.”). The court also held that the NVRA is limited to the \ncontext of a federal election. Id. And, because the alleged delay and failure to update the Broyles \nvoter’s registration information was only alleged to have affected a local election, there was no \nviable “cause of action under the NVRA.” Id. This was so despite the allegation that the voter \nregistration information was not updated at the same time the voter completed changed his driver \nlicense information online. Id. The Fifth Circuit affirmed, and specifically held the district court \nwas correct to conclude that the plaintiffs did not state a claim under the NVRA. Broyles, 381 Fed. \nApp’x at 373. \nAt minimum, Broyles compels dismissal of Woods’s claims. Woods’ entire case rests on \nan alleged attempt to vote on “Election Day 2015,” after he moved from West Virginia to Houston \na few months earlier. Doc. 1, ¶ 49. But Woods admits that he did not attempt to cast a ballot in a \n2015 federal election. Ex. C (Request for Admission # 15). Thus, the NVRA is not implicated. \nTo the extent Hernandez or Stringer alleges a non-mooted NVRA claim based—not on \ntheir voting registration status—but an alleged statutory right to “simultaneous” voter registration, \nBroyles makes clear that this is insufficient to maintain a claim under the NVRA, absent connection \n23 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 80   Filed 06/30/17   Page 24 of 25\nto a federal election. Here, it is undisputed that each Plaintiff was able to cast a ballot in the 2016 \nfederal general election, and is currently registered at his current address. \nAs a result, judgment as a matter of law is warranted on all of Plaintiffs’ NVRA claims. \nB.  Plaintiffs’ equal protection claim fails as a matter of law. \nPlaintiffs’ equal protection claims have no more merit than those under the NVRA. \nCritically, to establish an equal protection claim, a plaintiff must establish that a similarly-situated \ncomparator was treated differently. City of Cleburne, Tex. v. Cleburne Living Ctr., 473 U.S. 432, \n439 (1985). In this circuit, the term “similarly-situated” is a “stringent standard” that is defined \nnarrowly  and  requires  the  comparator  to  be  treated  more  favorably  in  “nearly  identical” \ncircumstances. Hockman v. Westward Comm., LLC, 282 F.Supp.2d 512, 527–28 (E.D. Tex. 2003); \nWheeler v. BL Dev. Corp., 415 F.3d 399, 405 (5th Cir. 2005).  \nPlaintiffs are Texas voters who changed the addresses on their Texas driver licenses online, \nbut did not complete the portion of the application that would update their voter registration \ninformation. Plaintiffs’ constitutional claims fail as a matter of law because there is no allegation—\nmuch less admissible evidence—that other voters who completed the same online transaction were \ntreated differently by Defendants. See Baranowski v. Hart, 486 F.3d 112, 123 (5th Cir. 2007) (As \na prerequisite to an equal protection claim, “the plaintiff must prove that similarly situated \nindividuals were treated differently.”). Instead, the law at issue is facially neutral to all similarly-\nsituated applicants. See Vill. of Arlington Heights v. Metro. Hous. Dev. Corp., 429 U.S. 252, 264-\n66 (1977) (holding that an equal protection claim premised on an outwardly neutral law requires \nproof of both a discriminatory effect and a discriminatory purpose). These undisputed facts defeat \nPlaintiffs’ equal protection claims as a matter of law.  \n \n24 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 80   Filed 06/30/17   Page 25 of 25\nConclusion \n \nThe Court should dismiss all of Plaintiffs’ claims with prejudice. \nRespectfully submitted, \n \nKEN PAXTON \nAttorney General of Texas \n \nJEFFREY C.

By refusing to offer \nsimultaneous voter registration to those who renew or update their driver’s licenses online, the \nState is intentionally excluding thousands of eligible Texas voters from the democratic process \neach election cycle. Unless and until Defendants reform their registration practices, large \nnumbers of Texas voters will continue to be disenfranchised.  \nWithout any persuasive legal precedents or policy reasons to justify their actions, \nDefendants do their best to distract the Court from this grave reality—making jurisprudential \narguments that have no basis in case law, offering a disingenuous description of their own \npolicies and exaggerating the remedy sought by the Plaintiffs. Thus, and for all of the reasons set \nforth below, Plaintiffs respectfully request that the Court deny Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss \nUnder Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6) (ECF No. 7) (the “Motion” or \n“MTD”), and allow this matter to proceed to discovery.   \nBACKGROUND \nA.  Legal Background \n1.  The National Voter Registration Act \nAfter finding that unfair and discriminatory voter registration procedures “have a direct \nand damaging effect on voter participation,” 52 U.S.C. § 20501(a)(3), Congress enacted the \nNational Voter Registration Act (“NVRA”) with the express purpose of “increas[ing] the number \nof eligible citizens who register to vote in elections for Federal Office,” id. at (b)(1). Under the \nNVRA, states must provide three categories of voter registration procedures: (1) voter \nregistration simultaneous with any driver’s license application, renewal, or change-of-address \ntransaction (the “Motor Voter” provisions, 52 U.S.C. § 20504); (2) voter registration by mail \n1 \n \n\nusing a standard, federal form, id. § 20505; and (3) voter registration at designated voter \nregistration agencies, id. § 20506.  \nPlaintiffs allege that Defendants’ current practices violate the Motor Voter provisions, \nwhich require the Texas Department of Public Safety (“DPS”) to simultaneously offer voter \nregistration with driver’s license transactions, without requiring additional or duplicative \ninformation other than what is required by law.1 Compl. ¶ 2. Specifically:  \n  Each state driver’s license application—including any renewal application—must also serve \nas an application for voter registration, unless the applicant fails to sign the application, 52 \nU.S.C. § 20504(a)(1), (c)(1); \n  The voter registration portion of the driver’s license application may not require any \nduplicative information, other than what is required by law, 52 U.S.C. § 20504(c)(2); \n  The voter registration portion must be promptly transmitted to the appropriate state election \nofficial, 52 U.S.C. § 20504(e), 20507(a)(1)(A); and  \n  Any driver’s license change-of-address form must be used to update the voter registration \nrolls, unless the applicant states on the form that the change of address is not for voter \nregistration purposes, 52 U.S.C. § 20504(d). \n \n2.  Texas’ Voter Registration Laws \nTexas’ Election Code was amended shortly after the enactment of the NVRA to comport \nwith federal law. See generally Tex. Elec. Code §§ 20.061–20.066.2 In order to offer the \nsimultaneous registration required by the NVRA, DPS must use “a form and procedure that \n                                                 \n1 Under Section 5 of the NVRA, Congress intended States to ideally create a system that “should \nbe so designed as to include the voter registration application as a simultaneous, automatic part \nof the overall process with the duplication of information requested and forms to be completed \nheld to an absolute minimum.” S. Rep. No. 103-6, at 6 (1993). Although Congress believed \nSection 5 of the NVRA would allow some discretion to States “as to how to administer th[e] \nprocess and how to integrate it with [each State’s] drivers license process,” discretion would be \nlimited by the requirement for simultaneous registration and the prohibition on duplicative \ninformation. Id. at 5-6. Congress specifically envisioned “a fully integrated, automated process, a \nsingle application form for use by both agencies requiring minimal duplication of information, or \nseparate application forms to be completed as part of a single, simultaneous application process \nat the driver’s license agency.” Id.; see also H. Rep. No. 103-9, at 9 (1993). \n2 These provisions of the Election Code were enacted in the mid-1990s and set forth registration \nprocedures for applicants who interact with DPS in person or by mail—they do not address \nonline transactions. See id. § 20.063. \n2 \n \n\ncombines the department’s application form for a license or card with an officially prescribed \nvoter registration application form,” id. § 20.062(a), and “a change of address form and \nprocedure that combines department and voter registration functions,” id. § 20.062(b). The \nchange-of-address form “must allow a licensee or cardholder to indicate whether the change of \naddress is also to be used for voter registration purposes.” Id. Each business day, DPS must \nelectronically transfer voter registration information to the Secretary of State (“SOS”). Id. § \n20.065(b).  \nWhile DPS uses separate paper forms for in-person license renewals versus change-of-\naddress transactions,3 it chose to combine renewal and change-of-address applications into a \nsingle process online. Compl. ¶¶ 34-42; see also Compl. Ex. A at 1-2. Thus, while the NVRA \ntreats driver’s license renewal and change of address procedures differently, 52 U.S.C. § \n20504(a)(1), (d), (c)(1),  the State makes no such distinction with respect to online transactions; \nonline applicants use the exact same process—and answer the same voter registration question—\nin renewing their license, changing their address, or completing both transactions. As Defendants \nnote, applicants are only eligible to use DPS’ online system if they have previously appeared in \nperson at a DPS office and meet other enumerated criteria. MTD at 4. \n3.  Provisional Voting Laws \nUnder federal law, when a voter’s eligibility cannot be determined at the polls, that voter \nhas a right to cast a provisional ballot that election officials will examine after the election. 52 \nU.S.C. § 21082. In Texas, local election officials must offer a provisional ballot to any voter who \nis not listed on the registration rolls for that county or who appears to vote at the wrong precinct, \n                                                 \n3 DPS, DL-64L Application for Change of Address on Valid Texas Driver License (DL) & \nIdentification Card (ID) (Rev. 3/16), https://www.txdps.state.tx.us/internetforms/Forms/DL-\n64.pdf; DPS, DL-43 Application for Renewal/Replacement/Change of a Texas Driver License or \nIdentification Card  (Rev. 9/15), https://www.txdps.state.tx.us/internetforms/Forms/DL-43.pdf.  \n3 \n \n\neven if properly registered within the county. Tex. Elec. Code §§ 63.006, 63.009.4 Local election \nofficials must use the information provided by a voter on the provisional ballot to register that \nvoter to vote or to update her registration records. See Tex. Elec. Code. § 65.056(a).   \nB.  Factual Background \nThe parties agree that Texas does not offer simultaneous voter registration or address \nupdates when an applicant states “yes . . . I want to register to vote” during an online DPS \ntransaction. MTD at 17; Compl. ¶¶ 3, 38, 42. It is also undisputed that each Plaintiff attempted to \nupdate his or her registration during an online change-of-address transaction with DPS, and that \neach Plaintiff believed that his or her voter registration was updated as a result. Compl. ¶¶ 46-50. \nWhile DPS received the information each Plaintiff submitted online—and used it to update each \nPlaintiff’s driver’s license—DPS failed to transmit their updated address information to the SOS. \nAs a result, the registration rolls were incorrect when Plaintiffs appeared to vote, and each \nPlaintiff was unable to cast a regular ballot in a recent election. Compl. ¶¶ 11-13.  \nDefendants also do not deny that they received complaints from more than 1,800 voters \nbetween September 2013 and May 2015 who were unable to cast a regular ballot after attempting \nto update their voter registration through an online DPS transaction, Compl. ¶¶ 9, 55, or that \nDefendants have been aware of widespread confusion—and disenfranchisement—caused by \ntheir policies since at least 2012. Compl. ¶ 57, Compl. Ex. C at 7-12. Defendants do not claim to \nhave taken any meaningful steps to address these issues. See generally MTD.  \nAs required by the NVRA, Plaintiffs Benjamin Hernandez and Totysa Watkins provided \nNotice to Defendants of the State’s NVRA violations on May 27, 2015.5 52 U.S.C. § 20510 (b); \n                                                 \n4 See also Texas Secretary of State, Qualifying Voters On Election Day: Handbook for Election \nJudges and Clerks, 15-16 (2016), \nhttp://www.sos.state.tx.us/elections/forms/election_judges_handbook.pdf. \n4 \n \n\nCompl. ¶¶ 12, 33, Compl. Ex. C at 2-21. Plaintiffs Stringer and Wood gave notice of their claims \nin Supplemental Notice Letters later that year. Compl. Ex. C. at 171-72, 195-96.6  \nARGUMENT \nA.  Standard of Review \nDefendants move to dismiss under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and \n12(b)(6). MTD at 1. The Court should only grant a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter \njurisdiction “if it appears certain that the plaintiff cannot prove any set of facts in support of his \n[or her] claim that would entitle plaintiff to relief.” Ramming v. United States, 281 F.3d 158, 161 \n(5th Cir. 2001) (citing Home Builders Ass’n of Miss., Inc. v. City of Madison, Miss., 143 F.3d \n1006, 1010 (5th Cir.1998)). Where a defendant challenges a plaintiff’s statutory standing, courts \napply the Rule 12(b)(6) standard, which requires the defendant to show that the plaintiff failed to \nstate a claim upon which relief can be granted. Harold H. Huggins Realty, Inc. v. FNC, Inc., 634 \n                                                                                                                                                             \n5 In addition to identifying the allegations in the instant lawsuit, the Notice described two other \nareas where the State was violating the NVRA—during in-person transactions at DPS offices \nand by failing to treat voter registration as the default choice. Compl. Ex. C at 5-12, 15-16. In \nresponse, the State agreed to implement “a policy of defaulting to registering an individual in \ncertain ambiguous cases,” and represented that it researched the names of 11 the voters listed in \nthe notice letter and found that “each . . . currently appears on the rolls of the county in which \n[the] Letter alleges they tried to register.” Compl. Ex. C at 22, 25. The parties subsequently met \nin person on July 20, 2015, Compl. Ex. C at 32, 40, and—after exchanging additional \ncorrespondence—ultimately reached agreement on several matters related to the State’s \ncompliance with the NVRA during in-person transactions at DPS. See Compl. Ex. C at 197-199. \nAccordingly, because Defendants agreed to reform policies and procedures related to in-person \ntransactions and to treating voter registration as the default choice, the instant case only concerns \nonline transactions. \n6 Defendants assert that Plaintiffs’ counsel “refused” to provide information necessary for the \nState to verify Plaintiffs’ registration status. MTD at n.4, 12-13. In reality, Defendants did verify \nthat each individual in the original letter—including Plaintiffs Hernandez and Watkins—was \nregistered, Compl. Ex. C at 25, and after meeting and reaching a partial agreement with respect \nto the in-person transaction violations, the parties subsequently conferred to again confirm that \nthe six individuals who transacted in-person with DPS were registered. Compl. Ex. C at 32, 34, \n41, 197-198. Undersigned counsel subsequently sent two Supplemental Notice Letters notifying \nthe State of NVRA violations on behalf of Plaintiffs Stringer and Woods, Compl. Ex. C. at 171-\n72, 195-96, but never received a response from the State requesting additional information or in \nany way “attempting compliance” with respect to these Plaintiffs.  \n5 \n \n\nF.3d 787, 795 n.2 (5th Cir. 2011). Courts do not require a plaintiff to provide a “heightened fact \npleading of specifics, but only enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.” \nBell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007). “Asking for plausible grounds does not \nimpose a probability requirement at the pleading stage; it simply calls for enough fact to raise a \nreasonable expectation that discovery will reveal evidence of [the violating conduct].” Id at 556. \nB.  Plaintiffs Have Standing under the NVRA7 \n“Congress . . . intended to extend standing under the [National Voter Registration] Act to \nthe maximum allowable under the constitution.” Ass’n. of Cmty. Orgs. for Reform Now v. \nFowler, 178 F.3d 350, 363 (5th Cir. 1999). As the Fifth Circuit recently affirmed, to establish \nArticle III standing, each plaintiff must demonstrate “that he or she has suffered injury in fact, \nthat the injury is fairly traceable to the actions of the defendant, and that the injury will likely be \nredressed by a favorable decision.” Scott v. Schedler, 771 F.3d 831, 837 (5th Cir. 2014) (internal \nquotation marks and citation omitted).   \nDefendants do not—and cannot—argue that Plaintiffs fail to adequately allege an injury \nin fact. Here, each Plaintiff advances specific allegations that he or she was denied a statutory \nright under the Motor Voter law to update voter registration through a DPS transaction, and was \ndisenfranchised as a result. As the Fifth Circuit has recognized, “[w]hen a person alleges a \nconcrete, particularized, and individual injury by virtue of the operation of a statute . . . Article \nIII standing to challenge that statute’s execution usually obtains.” Adar v. Smith, 597 F.3d 697, \n                                                 \n7 Defendants do not claim that Plaintiffs lack standing to bring their Equal Protection claims, so \nour standing discussion is limited to Plaintiffs’ claims under the NVRA. It is clear, however, that \nby alleging DPS’ policies make voter registration more difficult for prospective voters who \nengage in online transactions rather than in-person transactions, Plaintiffs sufficiently allege that \nthey have been denied equal treatment. NE Florida Chapter of Associated Gen. Contractors of \nAm. v. City of Jacksonville, Fla., 508 U.S. 656, 666, 113 (1993) (“The ‘injury in fact’ in an equal \nprotection case . . . is the denial of equal treatment resulting from the imposition of [a \ngovernmental] barrier, not the ultimate inability to obtain the benefit.”).  \n6 \n \n\n706 (5th Cir. 2010), overruled on other grounds but aff’d as to standing, 639 F.3d 146 (5th Cir. \n2011) (finding standing when registrar refused to issue birth certificate to same-sex parents). \nIndeed, it is well established that a state’s alleged failure to comply with the NVRA causes a \ncognizable injury to affected voters. Arcia v. Florida Sec’y of State, 772 F.3d 1335, 1341 (11th \nCir. 2014); Charles H. Wesley Educ. Found., Inc. v. Cox, 408 F.3d 1349, 1352 (11th Cir. 2005); \nJudicial Watch, Inc. v. King, 993 F. Supp. 2d 919, 924 (S.D. Ind. 2012); Common Cause of \nColorado v. Buescher, 750 F. Supp. 2d 1259, 1271-72 (D. Colo. 2010).  \nRather than challenging allegations of injury, Defendants attempt to argue that Plaintiffs \nfail to meet Article III’s causation and redressibility requirements. MTD at 7-10. But Plaintiffs’ \nComplaint plausibly alleges that Defendants’ unlawful policies, and not any inaction by \nPlaintiffs, caused their ongoing injuries. Policy reforms are necessary to redress their injuries.  \n1.  Plaintiffs’ injuries were caused by Defendants’ failure to comply with the NVRA  \nDefendants cite just one case, Westfall v. Miller, to support their position that Plaintiffs’ \ninjuries are “the result of their own behavior” and not traceable to Defendants’ NVRA violations. \nMTD at 7 (citing Westfall v. Miller, 77 F.3d 868 (1996)). But Westfall—a case about exhausting \nstatutory procedures—is inapposite. There, the plaintiff wished to purchase a machinegun. \nFederal law required that the plaintiff first submit an application to the Bureau of Alcohol, \nTobacco and Firearms (ATF), including a law enforcement agent’s certification that the weapon \nwould not be used for unlawful purposes. The plaintiff failed to obtain certification from local \nofficials, but filed suit against ATF in an attempt to have his machine gun application processed \nanyway. The district court dismissed the case for lack of standing, finding that—under the \nexpress terms of the applicable federal law—the plaintiff could not establish a cognizable injury \nuntil he had exhausted the process for obtaining certification. Westfall, 77 F.3d at 871-72. As the \n7 \n \n\ncourt pointed out, the plaintiff “will not have an injury of which to complain if [an official] \nprovides the requested certification,” because the ATF would presumably approve his \napplication. Id. at 872.  \nHere, Defendants do not argue that the Plaintiffs failed to exhaust any procedures \nrequired by the NVRA. Instead, Defendants maintain that Plaintiffs failed to follow instructions \nprovided by DPS—an argument that has nothing to do with the Westfall case or with Plaintiffs’ \nability to sue. MTD at 9. Plaintiffs need not comply with DPS procedures that violate the NVRA \nin order to establish standing to challenge the State’s failure to comply with the NVRA. Instead, \neach Plaintiff did exactly what the NVRA requires to trigger the State’s obligation to update their \nvoter registration file: Each submitted a change-of-address form to DPS and each indicated on \nthe form that “yes . . . I want to register to vote.” Compl. ¶ 5. Defendants failed to treat these \nonline transactions as “notification[s] of change of address for voter registration,” 52 U.S.C. § \n20504(d), and as a result of Defendants’ unlawful policies, each Plaintiff was unable to cast a \nregular ballot in an election. Compl. ¶¶ 38, 46-53.  \n2.  Requiring Defendants to comply with the NVRA will redress Plaintiffs’ injury \nRemarkably, Defendants assert that because they disenfranchised Plaintiffs in a past \nelection and because Plaintiffs do not allege that their registration records remain outdated, their \ninjuries are not redressable. MTD at 9-10. But this argument is based on a fundamental \nmisunderstanding of the NVRA. Under the NVRA, Plaintiffs have a statutory right to have \n“[a]ny change of address form submitted in accordance with State law for purposes of a State \nmotor vehicle driver’s license . . . serve as notification of change of address for voter \nregistration,” 52 U.S.C. § 20504(d); Plaintiffs also have a statutory right to be offered \nsimultaneous voter registration when they renew their drivers’ license, id. § 20504(c). Each \n8 \n \n\nPlaintiff is an eligible voter and Texas driver’s license holder who must continue to interact with \nDPS to renew and update his or her license, and plans to continue transacting with DPS online. \nCompl. ¶¶ 46-53. Thus, the injunctive relief requested, forcing Defendants to comply with the \nNVRA, is the only way to redress the ongoing harm alleged.8   \nIndeed, in similar cases, federal courts have recognized that injunctive relief forcing \ncompliance with the NVRA is the appropriate way to redress injuries caused by alleged NVRA \nviolations, and have rejected the argument that “fixing” an individual’s registration records can \nalone suffice. In Charles H. Wesley Education Foundation v. Cox, for example, one plaintiff \nattempted to update her address for voter registration purposes by using the standard voter \nregistration form that the NVRA requires states to accept, 52 U.S.C. § 20505(a)(1), but the \nGeorgia Secretary of State rejected it. 408 F.3d at 1351. Georgia argued that the plaintiff lacked \nstanding because she was an “already registered voter” so “she suffered no injury that can be \ntraced to the state.” Id.  Rejecting this position, the Eleventh Circuit found that her injury—the \nstatutory right under the NVRA to use the federal form to change her address—would be \nredressed by the relief requested, an injunction to “permanently withdraw[] the additional \nregistration requirements that Defendants seek to impose on her.” Id. at 1352 n.3; see also Arcia, \n772 F.3d at 1341 (finding that individual voters removed from rolls in violation of Section 8 of \nNVRA had standing to sue for prospective relief even after they were reinstated, because of \n“realistic probability” that ongoing violations could again affect their registration status). \n                                                 \n8 Plaintiffs request an order enjoining the Defendants from violating the NVRA and mandating \ncompliance with the NVRA by, inter alia, “providing for the electronic transfer of voter \nregistration information collected through online transactions [with DPS] to the Secretary of \nState, similar to the existing system to transfer voter registration information collected through \nin-person transactions.” Compl. Request for Relief, ¶¶ iii, iv. The requested relief would not only \nredress the statutory injury suffered by Plaintiffs under the NVRA, but it would redress the \ninjuries suffered under the Equal Protection Clause as well.  \n9 \n \n\nC.  A Live Controversy Remains  \nDefendants also argue that because the Plaintiffs were subsequently registered to vote, \nthere is no live controversy and the case is thus moot. MTD at 10-11. They are incorrect for a \nnumber of reasons.  \nTo start, as the Supreme Court recently reaffirmed:  \n[A] suit becomes moot when the issues presented are no longer ‘live’ or the \nparties lack a legally cognizable interest in the outcome . . . only when it is \nimpossible for a court to grant any effectual relief whatever to the prevailing \nparty. As long as the parties have a concrete interest, however small, in the \noutcome of the litigation, the case is not moot.  \n \nChafin v. Chafin, 133 S. Ct. 1017, 1023 (2013) (citations and internal quotations omitted). Here, \nthe unlawful policies that caused Plaintiffs’ injuries are ongoing. Defendants have made clear \nthat they will not change their voter registration procedures unless forced to by the Court.  \nBy arguing that the case became moot when Plaintiffs’ registration records were updated, \nDefendants “confuse[] mootness with the merits,” id. at 1024—and try to render useless the \nNVRA’s private right of action. Plaintiffs did not learn of the State’s NVRA violations until they \nattempted to vote and learned that their registration records had not been updated. Compl. ¶ ¶ 46-\n53. At the polls, each Plaintiff, except for Mr. Stringer, was given a provisional ballot as \nmandated by state and federal law. See Tex. Elec. Code. § 65.056(a); 52 U.S.C. § 21082; Compl. \n¶¶ 46-53. County election officials used those provisional ballots to update Plaintiffs’ registration \nrecords after the election. Tex. Elec. Code. § 65.056(a). If Defendants are correct, almost no one \nwould be able to sue after being disenfranchised on Election Day because, as a direct result of \nbeing disenfranchised, their registration records would have been updated by having to cast a \nprovisional ballot.  \n10 \n \n\n  Moreover, as the Fifth Circuit and other federal courts have found, an exception to \nmootness applies here.   \nThe  “capable  of  repetition,  yet  evading  review”  exception  to  the  mootness \ndoctrine applies where (1) the challenged action is in its duration too short to be \nfully  litigated  prior  to  cessation  or  expiration,  and  (2)  there  is  a  reasonable \nexpectation that the same complaining party will be subject to the same action \nagain. Davis v. FEC, 554 U.S. 724, 735, 128 S.Ct. 2759, 2769–70, 171 L.Ed.2d \n737 (2008) (quotation marks omitted) (rejecting mootness argument despite fact \nthat election had passed).  \n \nArcia, 772 F.3d at 1343 (rejecting that NVRA claim was moot post-election); Ctr. for Individual \nFreedom v. Carmouche, 449 F.3d 655, 661-62 (5th Cir. 2006) (rejecting that election law claim \nwas moot post-election). Due to the inherent time constraints involved with election-related \nlitigation, the Fifth Circuit has found that such cases present “the paradigmatic circumstances in \nwhich the Supreme Court has found that full litigation can never be completed before the precise \ncontroversy (a particular election) has run its course.” Carmouche, 449 F.3d at 661. Accordingly, \n“[s]uits challenging the validity of state election laws are classic examples of cases in which the \nissues are ‘capable of repetition, yet evading review.’” Id. (quoting Morial v. Judiciary Comm’n, \n565 F.2d 295, 297 n. 3 (5th Cir.1977)) (alterations in original).  \nThe Carmouche case is particularly illustrative. There, after reaffirming that election law \ncontroversies satisfy the first “capable of repetition, yet evading review” prong, the Fifth Circuit \nwent on to explain that “the Court does not always focus on whether a particular plaintiff is \nlikely to incur the same injury,” but asks whether other similarly situated voters could be \naffected. 449 F.3d at 662. The court concluded that “even if it were doubtful that the [plaintiff] \nwould again attempt to engage in [the same conduct], precedent suggests that this case is not \nmoot, because other individuals certainly will be affected by the continuing existence of the \n[allegedly unlawful law].” Id.  \n11 \n \n\nPlaintiffs’ allegations clearly satisfy the relevant inquiry. First, each Plaintiff believed \nthat he or she had properly updated voter registration information by submitting a change-of-\naddress form online to DPS and indicating “Yes . . . I want to register to vote.” Each Plaintiff \nonly learned that the State failed to update his or her record at the polls, and thus had no ability \nto bring this litigation prior to the election. Compl. ¶¶ 46-52. Second, as noted supra, page 9, \neach Plaintiff must continue to interact with DPS to renew and update his or her license and \nplans to do so online; thus, each Plaintiff is likely to suffer ongoing and future injuries. \nMoreover, Defendants have admitted to receiving complaints from thousands of other voters \nwho have been disenfranchised due to the policies challenged in this lawsuit. Compl. ¶¶ 9, 55, \n57, Ex. C at 7-12. Thus, “the issues properly presented” here “will persist as [Defendants’ \npolicies] are applied in future elections,” preventing mootness. Storer v. Brown, 415 U.S. 724, n. \n8 (1974); accord Arcia, 772 F.3d at 1343.9 \nD.  Plaintiffs Provided Proper Notice \nPlaintiffs provided extensive notice to Defendants of their failures to comply with the \nNVRA, and Defendants do not challenge the sufficiency of that notice under 52 U.S.C. § 20510. \nInstead, Defendants argue they are immune from suit because they allegedly made genuine, pre-\nsuit attempts to comply with the Motor Voter mandates after receiving Plaintiffs’ Notice. MTD \nat 11-13. In fact, Defendants only attempted to verify two of the four Plaintiffs’ voter registration \nstatus after they were disenfranchised as a result of Defendants’ NVRA violations. MTD at 13; \nsee also supra note 6.  This cannot constitute “attempting compliance” with the NVRA. If states \n                                                 \n9 Ignoring Carmouche and other relevant case law, Defendants try to argue that, because \nPlaintiffs can anticipate that Defendants will continue to violate the NVRA, any future injuries \nwill be a result of Plaintiffs’ failure to avail themselves of other means to register to vote “rather \nthan any conduct of the Defendants.” MTD at 11. That is absurd. Plaintiffs need not avoid \nengaging in NVRA-covered transactions because they now know that Defendants’ treatment of \nthose transactions violates their rights.  \n12 \n \n\ncould immunize themselves from suit by simply checking a complainant’s registration status or \noffering to register them after the fact, no individual voter could ever enforce compliance with \nthe NVRA, frustrating Congress’ intent to create a private right of action. 52 U.S.C. § 20510. \nDefendants have thus neither attempted nor achieved “compliance” with respect to Plaintiffs, and \nthere is no evidence that they have done so with respect to the thousands of similarly-situated \ncomplainants that have come forward as of May 2015. Compl. ¶¶ 9, 55.10 \nTo support their position, Defendants point to one distinguishable subsection of Georgia \nState Conference of NAACP. v. Kemp, 841 F. Supp. 2d 1320 (N.D. Ga. 2012), a case that, in fact, \nsupports Plaintiffs’ NVRA allegations. The dispute in Kemp concerned Section 7 of the NVRA, \nwhich applies to social service agencies and, unlike the Motor Voter provisions, does not require \nsimultaneous voter registration. 52 U.S.C. § 20506; Kemp, 841 F.Supp.2d at 1329. As noted \ninfra, page 18, the Kemp court found that the NVRA’s social service mandates reach online \ntransactions, relying upon the plain meaning of the terms “each application” and “each \nrecertification, renewal, or change of address form” in Section 7. 841 F. Supp. 2d at 1329.  \nThe Kemp court also found, however, that Georgia “attempted to comply with” Section 7 \nof the NVRA by mailing one complainant a voter registration form and taking other steps that \namounted to “more than an empty gesture” to comply with in-person registration requirements. \nId. at 1336. Here, as described supra, note 5, Plaintiffs do not challenge the State’s procedures \nfor voter registration with in-person DPS transaction, because the State agreed to make \nmeaningful changes to those policies. But the State has refused to reform its policies with regard \nto online transactions. Mere attempts “to verify the registration status” of two out of the four \n                                                 \n10 As explained above, each Plaintiff other than Mr. Stringer submitted a provisional ballot, \nwhich under Texas law was subsequently treated at the county level—not by Defendants—as a \nvoter registration application. See Tex. Elec. Code. § 65.056(a)10; Compl. ¶ ¶ 46-53. \n13 \n \n\nPlaintiffs are insufficient to “attempt compliance” under any section of the NVRA, let alone the \nMotor Voter provisions, for the reasons set supra, note 6 and page 10.11   \nE.  Plaintiffs State Cognizable Claims under the NVRA \n1.  Texas misstates its own policies and procedures \nAs the State has previously explained, to obtain a new Texas driver’s license, one must \ngo to a DPS location in person and complete a form “that combines the department’s application \nform for a license . . . with an officially prescribed voter registration application form.” Compl. \nEx. C at 133. This form, the “Application for Texas Driver License or Identification Card,”12 \nincludes Question Number 2, which asks, “If you are a US citizen, would you like to register to \nvote? If registered, would you like to update your voter information?” It also states that:   \nBy  providing  my  electronic  signature,  I  understand  the  personal \ninformation on my application form and my electronic signature will be \nused  for  submitting  my  voter’s  registration  application  to  the  Texas \nSecretary of State’s office. Wanting to register to vote, I authorize the \nDepartment of Public Safety to transfer this information to the Texas \nSecretary of State.13 \n \nBy law, the prospective voter’s information—including his or her electronic signature—\nmust be inputted “into the department’s electronic data system” and promptly transferred to the \nSecretary of State. Tex. Elec. Code § 20.066. Ultimately, as the State notes, MTD at 15, this \nelectronic signature is filed with county officials and used for verifying the voter at the polls.  \n                                                 \n11 Even if the State had sent each Plaintiff a separate voter registration form, as Georgia did in \nKemp, it would be insufficient to “attempt compliance” under Section 5, 52 U.S.C. § 20504. \nUnder the Motor Voter provisions of the NVRA, the State must use a simultaneous application \nand cannot require duplicative information; a wholly separate application requiring duplicative \ninformation is not sufficient. Id. § 20504(a)(2)(A). \n12 DPS, DL-14-A Application for Texas Driver License or Identification Card (Rev. 10/16), \nhttp://www.dps.texas.gov/internetforms/Forms/DL-14A.pdf. \n13 DPS’s paper driver’s license renewal form, DL-43, contains identical language.  DPS, DL-43 \nApplication for Renewal/Replacement/Change of a Texas Driver License or Identification Card, \nhttps://www.txdps.state.tx.us/internetforms/Forms/DL-43.pdf. \n14 \n \n\nIn order to be eligible to use DPS’ online system in the first place, a driver’s license \nholder must have previously visited DPS in person and signed the joint driver’s license/voter \nregistration application, MTD at 4, causing her electronic signature to go to election officials and \nto be placed in her DPS file. In addition to expressly using electronic signatures for voter \nregistration purposes, DPS apparently uses them to satisfy the signature requirement for driver’s \nlicense renewals. 37 Tex. Adm. Code § 15.21.  Given that applicants, like Plaintiffs, who attempt \nto register to vote or update information online with DPS have electronic signatures already on \nfile with DPS, and that these electronic signatures are deemed sufficient for other DPS \ntransactions, it is disingenuous for Defendants to claim that Plaintiffs failed to provide a \nsignature with their online transactions.14  \nMoreover, it cannot be, as the State argues, that by stating “Yes . . . I want to register to \nvote,” a prospective voter is somehow conveying that “the change of address is not for voter \nregistration purposes.” MTD at 15-16. Not only does this interpretation defy common sense and \nturns the NVRA on its head, it ignores our Plaintiffs’ credible allegations that, by selecting “Yes \n. . . I want to register to vote” they wished to have their registration records updated.  \n2.  Precedent Supports Plaintiffs’ Reading of the NVRA \nAs the Fifth Circuit has repeatedly explained, to ascertain the meaning of a law, “the \ncourt must look to the particular statutory language at issue, as well as the language and design \nof the statute as a whole.” Salazar v. Maimon, 750 F.3d 514, 518 (5th Cir. 2014) (internal \nquotation marks and citations omitted). Words must be afforded their “ordinary, contemporary, \nand common meaning.” Contender Farms, L.L.P. v. U.S. Dep't of Agric., 779 F.3d 258, 268 (5th \n                                                 \n14 At the very least, Defendants’ fact-laden argument cannot be the basis for dismissal at this \nearly juncture. Smith v. Regional Transit Authority, 756 F.3d 340, 347 (5th Cir. 2014) (“disputed \nquestions of fact are anathema to Rule 12(b)(6) jurisprudence, unless those disputed facts are \nimmaterial to the outcome”). \n15 \n \n\nCir. 2015). The law’s plain language is controlling, and the court will not look beyond that \nlanguage except in those “rare instances where using the plain meaning of the text creates an \nabsurd result.” Peter v. GC Servs. L.P., 310 F.3d 344, 351 (5th Cir. 2002). \nHere, the plain meaning of the relevant statutory language of 52 U.S.C. § 20504 is clear:  \n  “Each State motor vehicle driver’s license application (including any renewal application) \nsubmitted to the appropriate State motor vehicle authority under State law shall serve as an \napplication for voter registration . . .  unless the applicant fails to sign the voter registration \napplication[.]”  \n  “Any change of address form submitted in accordance with State law for purposes of a State \nmotor vehicle driver’s license shall serve as notification of change of address for voter \nregistration . . .  unless the registrant states on the form that the change of address is not for \nvoter registration purposes[.]” \n \nId. § 20504(a), (d) (emphasis added). “Each” and “any” are commonly understood to be \ninterchangeable with the terms “every” and “all.”  For instance, Webster’s New World College \nDictionary defines: “all” as “every one of” and “any whatsoever”; “any” as “every”; “each” as \n“every one of two or more considered separately”; and “every” as “each, and including all.” \nWebster’s New World College Dictionary, 36, 64, 446, 493 (4th ed. 1999). Thus, the NVRA’s \nplain language includes no limitation on transaction type—every driver’s license renewal and \nchange-of-address transaction must be used for voter registration, including online transactions.    \nDefendants offer no real explanation for why they refuse to use every renewal and \nchange-of-address transaction, including online transactions, for voter registration purposes as \nmandated by 52 U.S.C. § 20504(d). Instead, they contend that “[u]nder the ‘plain meaning’ of 52 \nU.S.C. § 20504(a)(1), (c)(1), without a signed voter registration application, driver license \nrenewals do not amount to applications for voter registration.” MTD at 17. But this argument \nmisses the mark for at least three reasons.  \nFirst, as described supra, pages 14–15, Defendants ignore that each Plaintiff has an \nelectronic signature on file, because each originally applied for a driver’s license in person at a \n16 \n \n\nDPS office. Second, Defendants misread the Motor Voter mandates. States must offer \nsimultaneous voter registration to any applicant who submits a renewal application or change-of-\naddress form “under State law”—meaning that the driver’s license transaction is properly \nsubmitted under law and otherwise valid. See 52 U.S.C. § 20504(a)-(b). Texas allows electronic \nsignatures that were created when applicants first applied for a driver’s license to be seamlessly \nused for subsequent renewal applications and change-of-address submissions, Tex. Elec. Code § \n63.002, and nothing in the NVRA or in the Texas Election Code impose any further \nrequirements when those same signatures are used for voter registration.  \nThird, as Defendants concede, MTD at 17, Scott v. Schedler, 771 F.3d 831 (5th Cir. \n2014) concerns specific language in Section 7 of the NVRA and does not address the Motor \nVoter provisions at all.15 Moreover, read fairly, the logic of Scott affirms the Plaintiffs’ positions. \nThe Scott court’s emphasis on applying the plain meaning of the NVRA supports the argument \nthat online transactions are covered by the Motor Voter mandates for the reasons described in \nDefendants’ Motion at 16. Indeed, the Fifth Circuit in Scott did not disturb the lower court’s \ninterpretation of 52 U.S.C. § 20506(a)(6), which applied Section 7 of the NVRA to online \ntransactions with Louisiana social service agencies.  \nIn reaching that conclusion, the District Court found that the Congress’ use of the word \n“each” in the NVRA was significant—unlike the word “at,” which “clearly denotes a specific \n                                                 \n15 The Scott plaintiffs claimed that Louisiana failed to comply with Section 7 of the NVRA, \nwhich requires social service agencies register their customers to vote, “unless the applicant, in \nwriting, declines to register to vote.” 771 F.3d at 841. Section 7 expressly requires social service \nagencies use a form with the language, “IF YOU DO NOT CHECK EITHER BOX, YOU WILL \nBE CONSIDERED TO HAVE DECIDED NOT TO REGISTER TO VOTE AT THIS TIME.” \nId. Relying upon the plain text of this provision, codified at 52 U.S.C. ¶ 20506, the Scott court \nrejected the plaintiffs’ challenge and upheld Louisiana’s decision not to register applicants who \nfailed to check either box. 771 F.3d at 841-42. \n17 \n \n\nlocation,” the word “each” has no “locational limitation.” Ferrand v. Schedler, No. CIV.A. 11-\n926, 2012 WL 1570094, at *10 (E.D. La. May 3, 2012). It also explained that: \n. . . Congress’s purpose in enacting the NVRA was to ensure that all \nAmericans are affirmatively provided an opportunity to register to vote. \nCongress made this intent clear when it uses such language as ‘in addition’ \nand ‘each.’  Thus, the reading of [52 U.S.C. § 20506(a)(6)] as applying to \nevery transaction, whether it be in person or remote, serves to accomplish \nthe clear goal of Congress. \n \nId. at *11; accord Kemp, 841 F. Supp. 2d at 1329 (reaching same conclusion). Tellingly, the \nDepartment of Justice—an agency charged by statute with enforcing the NVRA—has reached \nthe same conclusion. DOJ guidance confirms that when a state allows residents to apply for, \nrenew or update address information via the Internet, those remote transaction must \nsimultaneously allow for voter registration, just like in-person transactions.16 \n3.  This lawsuit is not about universal online voter registration \nThe State erroneously conflates what the NVRA requires—simultaneous voter \nregistration with all lawful driver’s license transactions—with universal, online voter \nregistration. MTD at 17-18.17 In doing so, the State exaggerates the remedy sought by Plaintiffs.  \nThe State is correct that the NVRA does not require states to offer driver’s license \ntransactions online. Plaintiffs agree that, pursuant to the NVRA, Texas could lawfully require all \ndrivers’ license holders to appear at DPS in person to renew their license or update their address. \nBut, because the State permits certain driver’s license transactions to occur online, Defendants \nmust ensure that these online transactions comply with the NVRA.  \n                                                 \n16 See U.S. Dep’t of Justice, The National Voter Registration Act of 1993: Questions and \nAnswers, http://www.justice.gov/crt/about/vot/nvra/nvra_faq.php (last visited May 27, 2016). \n17 Defendants show even greater confusion by citing a law discussing research by the Election \nAssistance Commission on “voting through the Internet”—an issue that has no bearing on the \nNVRA’s voter registration mandates. MTD at 17, n.11 (emphasis added).   \n18 \n \n\nThe remedy Plaintiffs seek would permit just a subsection of Texas driver’s license \nholders to register to vote or update their voter-registration address information online, as \nopposed to universal, online voter registration, which would apply to a far larger population of \nvoters.18 Texas law only permits online renewals for U.S. citizens with a Social Security number \nand electronic signature on file who most recently renewed in person, MTD at 4, thereby sharply \nlimiting the number of individuals who can renew their license online and, by extension, register \nto vote in that manner. Online change-of-address transactions are permitted for a greater number \nof users, but transmitting this data would merely serve to update a voter’s existing voter \nregistration files—ensuring that the State’s voter rolls are more accurate and thus more secure, \nconsistent with the purposes of the NVRA. See 52 U.S.C. § 20501(b)(3), (4).  \nFar from asking the State to impose any radical new program, Plaintiffs seek to use \nexisting DPS processes to comply with clear, longstanding federal law. Again, DPS already \nelectronically captures the information necessary to register a voter or to update a voter’s address \ninformation. DPS also already asks each driver’s license holder if he or she would like to register \nto vote during each online renewal and change-of-address transaction. Contrary to the State’s \ncharacterization, Plaintiffs’ position is straightforward: In order to comply with the NVRA, DPS \nmust transmit the registration information it already receives to election officials. \nF.  Plaintiffs State Cognizable Equal Protection Claims  \n “[A] citizen has a constitutionally protected right to participate in elections on an \nequal basis with other citizens in the jurisdiction.” [Dunn v. Blumstein, 405 U.S. \n330, 336 (1972)]. “Having once granted the right to vote on equal terms, the State \nmay not, by later arbitrary and disparate treatment, value one person's vote over \nthat of another.” [Bush v. Gore, 531 U.S. 98, 104-105 (2000)]. \n                                                 \n18 For instance, under House Bill 76, which failed to pass in the 2015 legislative session, any \nperson with a driver’s license or personal ID card would have been able to register to vote \nonline—a much larger population.  H.B. 76, 84th Leg., Reg. Sess. (Tex. 2015), available at \nhttp://www.legis.state.tx.us/tlodocs/84R/billtext/pdf/HB00076I.pdf#navpanes=0. \n19 \n \n\n \nObama for Am. v. Husted, 697 F.3d 423, 428 (6th Cir. 2012). Accordingly, the Equal Protection \nClause applies when the “state either classifies voters in disparate ways” or “places restrictions \non the right to vote.” Id. (citations omitted). Here, Plaintiffs have plausibly alleged that \nDefendants subjected them to disparate treatment, causing them to be disenfranchised, for no \nreason other than how they choose to complete a valid DPS transaction. Compl. ¶¶ 33-57.   \nDefendants wrongly assert that Plaintiff’s Equal Protection claims are invalid because \nPlaintiffs fail to adequately allege that two similarly situated groups of citizens were treated \ndifferently by the State’s voter registration policies at DPS. MTD at 18-19. But there is no \ndispute that Plaintiffs submitted a valid change-of-address form for purposes of updating their \nlicenses, or that, had those Plaintiffs submitted their change-of-address forms in person, the State \nwould  have  updated  their  registration  records.  Instead,  Defendants  repackage  their  flawed \narguments about Plaintiffs’ supposed failures to sign the registration applications, see MTD at \n19,  which  fail  for  the  reasons  set  forth  above.  Defendants  have  offered  no  non-arbitrary \njustification for unlawfully burdening Plaintiffs’ right to vote.  \nCONCLUSION \nFor all of these reasons, Plaintiffs request that this Court deny Defendants’ Motion in full.  \n   \n20 \n \n\nDated: May 31, 2016         Respectfully submitted,  \nPeter A.

Statement of Inquiry \n \n1.  I have been asked to assess the capacity of the state of Texas to update voter \nregistration records based on information that Texans provide to the Department of \nPublic Safety (DPS) through an online portal when they renew their drivers’ licenses \nor submit a change of address.  When Texans perform these tasks in person at a motor \nvehicle office, DPS transmits the information to the Secretary of State (SOS) to \nupdate voter records. However, when the same tasks are performed online, the voter’s \nnew information is not supplied to the SOS. The question in why. It is plausible that \nthere are technical, logistical, political, and legal reasons that Texas does not update \nits files in this way. As a scholar who studies voter registration systems, I have been \nasked to review depositions from state officials and offer an assessment of the \nlogistical challenges that may explain Texas’s policy decision in this matter. \n \nII.  Background and Qualifications \n2.  I am an assistant professor of political science and a resident fellow of the Institution \nfor Social and Policy Studies at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut. I joined \nthe faculty at Yale in 2011. I received my PhD in government from Harvard \nUniversity in 2011.  \n3.  The expertise I bring to bear on this case is specifically my familiarity with voter \nregistration systems and my prior work in linking records of drivers licenses to voter \nregistration databases.  \n  2 \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 67-1   Filed 06/06/17   Page 3 of 16\n4.  My scholarly research focuses on the topic of U.S. elections, specifically on voter \nbehavior, election administration, and political campaigns. My methodological focus \nis in using individual-level data such as digitized voter registration records to study \npolitics. Peer-reviewed articles such as “The Primacy of Race in the Geography of \nIncome-Based Voting” (American Journal of Political Science, 2016), “Democratic \nand Republican Physicians Provide Different Care on Politicized Health Issues” \n(Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 2016), “The Dynamic Election: \nPatterns of Early Voting Across Time, State, Party, and Age,” (Election Law Journal, \n2016), “Movers, Stayers, and Registration: Why Age is Correlated with Registration \nin the US” (Quarterly Journal of Political Science, 2012), and others all utilize voter \nregistration records to study politics. In addition, I have written about the quality of \nrecords in state voter systems (“Voter Registration: The Process and Quality of \nLists,” in The Measure of American Elections, 2014) and the use of voter registration \ndatabases in campaign politics (Hacking the Electorate, 2015). \n5.  I have been deposed as an expert witness in Judicial Watch, et al. v. King, et al., an \nNVRA case involving the state of Indiana. I have also been deposed in Fish v. \nKobach, a voter registration case currently underway in Kansas. I have also served as \nan expert consultant in Texas v. Holder and Veasey v. Perry, two cases involving a \nvoter identification law in the state of Texas.  \n6.  I am compensated for my work at a rate of $200 per hour. \n7.  A copy of my current CV is attached as Exhibit A to this Report. \n8.  A list of the materials I reviewed is attached as Exhibit B to this Report. \n  3 \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 67-1   Filed 06/06/17   Page 4 of 16\n9.  A list of my non-academic published writing in addition to the publications listed in \nmy CV that I’ve published in the previous 10 years is attached as Exhibit C to this \nReport.  \n \nIII.  Policy Landscape \n \n10. With the widespread adoption of the Internet, governments are increasingly moving \nservices online that had previously been available only in person or by mail. For \ninstance, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, all but twelve \nstates already have online voter registration or are in the process of implementing \nsuch a policy. In eleven of the 38 states with online registration, the policy was \nadopted without any legislation, but simply as a technological upgrade to an existing \ngovernment function.1 \n11. The trend to online services is, of course, not unique to voter registration. For \ninstance, in complying with the Truth in Mileage Act, a federal statute that requires \nthe collection of a signature on an odometer disclosure form, the state of Texas \npetitioned the federal government to substitute the signature requirement and allow \nfor an online transaction without a signature. The state asked the federal government \nto allow individuals to authenticate their identity by providing personal information. \nThe state “assert[ed] that its proposal provides a level of security equivalent to that of \n                                                           \n1 “Online Voter Registration,” National Conference of State Legislatures,” January 31, 2017. Accessed \nMarch 27, 2017. http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/electronic-or-online-voter-\nregistration.aspx \n  4 \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 67-1   Filed 06/06/17   Page 5 of 16\nan existing disclosure on secure paper titles and that on-line identity authentication \nacts in lieu of an actual signature on the title.”2  \n12. Citizens are also increasingly interacting online with state agencies such as the \nDepartments of Motor Vehicles (DMV) and assistance agencies. When states shift to \nonline transactions, they may choose to authenticate an individual’s identity by asking \nthe person to report information like their driver’s license number and part of their \nsocial security as an alternative to signatures. For example, the state of Texas allows \nthis alternative form of authentication when residents conduct certain transactions on \nTexas.gov, like renewing licenses online through the Department of Public Safety.3  \nErin Hutchins, general manager and director of portal operations for Texas NIC, \nexplained the online authentication system used for DPS transactions, whereby a user \nenters in personal information, and then “Texas.gov sends a real-time authentication \nand eligibility request to DPS and DPS, essentially, sends back a real-time yes or \nno.”4 \n13.  In other settings, Texas.gov authenticates online users not through a real-time \nprocess, but through regularly-updated extract files containing personal data that state \nagencies share with NIC, the Texas.gov vendor. For example, the Department of State \nHealth Services uses this Texas Online Authentication System (TOAS) to allow users \nto authenticate and request their vital records (Hutchins deposition p. 26:7-28:9). \n                                                           \n2 See U.S. Department of Transportation, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 49 CFR Part \n580, Docket No. NHTSA 2009 0174 Notice 2.

According to the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA), state agencies like DMVs \nare required to incorporate voter registration into their services. When these agencies \nmove to online transactions, they may fail to comply with the NVRA by not \nincorporating voter registration seamlessly into their online systems.5  As the \nbipartisan Presidential Commission on Election Administration noted in its 2014 \nreport, agencies that are required under the NVRA to offer opportunities for citizens \nto register to vote violate the NVRA when they offer services online but “voter \nregistration is left out of the online portals and website designs of these agencies.”6 \nHowever, as I describe, some states have found straightforward solutions to comply \nwith the law online. \n15. The technology clearly exists for state motor vehicle authorities that allow online \ntransactions (e.g. renewals and changes of address) to share the user’s updated \ninformation with the election administration in an automated fashion. For instance, \nwhen a resident of California uses the state’s online system to submit an address \nchange, a message states, “You may authorize DMV to notify the Secretary of State \nof a voter change of address if you are already registered to vote.”7  \n                                                           \n5 The NVRA references State motor vehicle authorities. While some states administer driver licenses \nthrough DMVs, Texas administers its driver licenses through the Department of Public Safety. \n6 See Robert F. Bauer and Benjamin L. Ginsberg, co-chairs, “The American Voting Experience: Report \nand Recommendations of the Presidential Commission on Election Administration,” January 2014. \nhttps://law.stanford.edu/publications/the-american-voting-experience-report-and-recommendations-of-\nthe-presidential-commission-on-election-administration/ \n7 State of California, Department of Motor Vehicles, Change of Address System.

Even states that, like Texas, do not offer online voter registration, comply with \nNVRA requirements in online transactions. In Michigan, for example, the state \nwebsite explains:  \nWhen you move, you must change the address on your driver's license as soon as \npossible. A change of address may be submitted at a Secretary of State office, online \nthrough ExpressSOS or by mail using the change-of-address form. By changing the \naddress on your driver's license, all driver, vehicle and voter registration files in your \nSecretary of State Record will be updated with your new address.8  \nIn North Carolina, another state that, like Texas, does not offer voter registration \nonline, a similar process is used and explained to citizens. When a citizen of North \nCarolina navigates to the online DMV system for license renewal, a message states, \n“You can use this service to submit voter registration information, which DMV will \nsend to state elections officials.”9 \n \nA.  Texas System of Online Transactions \n17. The Texas DPS’s system for online transactions is different from these examples \nabove. But before describing how Texas processes online transactions, it is useful to \nexamine how Texas incorporates voter registration into its in-person motor vehicle \ntransactions.  When an individual changes their address or renews their license in \nperson, they fill out a physical form and give the form to a customer service \nrepresentative who inputs the information into the computer system. One question on \nthe form asks, “If you are a US citizen, would you like to register to vote? If \n                                                           \n8 State of Michigan, Address Change on a Registration, Accessed March 27, 2017, \nhttp://www.michigan.gov/sos/0,4670,7-127-1585_1587_1590-25230--,00.html \n9 North Carolina Division of Motor Vehicles, “Login to Renew Your Driver License,” Accessed March \n27, 2017 https://edmv.ncdot.gov/DriverLicenseRenewal \n  7 \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 67-1   Filed 06/06/17   Page 8 of 16\nregistered, would you like to update your voter information?” If the person responds \naffirmatively, DPS electronically transmits the individual’s personal information to \nthe Secretary of State’s office. No further action is required by the registrant.  \n18. The Department of Public Safety shares information with SOS in two files. In the \ndaily update file, DPS informs the SOS of any new record or any change to existing \nrecords. In the daily voter registration file, DPS informs the SOS of information of \nnew registrations or updated address information for changed addresses. In other \nwords, for in-person transactions, DPS informs the SOS when personal data in its file \nhas been added or changed (daily update file) and also informs DPS of new voter \nregistrations or changes in personal data such as an updated address (voter \nregistration file).  \n19. Now consider Texas’s online procedure. When citizens of Texas renew their license \nonline or process a change of address, they are presented with the option to select Yes \nor No in response to a prompt stating, “I want to register to vote.” But they are told \nthat “selecting Yes does not register you to vote.” Instead of DPS sharing the voter’s \ninformation with the election administration, as other states do and as Texas does for \nin-person and mail transactions, the Texas online portal directs the user to an external \nwebsite where he or she can download an unpopulated registration application and \nmail it to the election office themselves.  \n20. Texas’s online process seems incongruent with the language of Section 5 of the \nNVRA entitled “Simultaneous Application for Voter Registration and Application for \nMotor Vehicle Driver’s License,” which requires that each driver’s license \n  8 \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 67-1   Filed 06/06/17   Page 9 of 16\napplication serves as an application for voter registration.10 The statute explains that \n“the voter registration application portion of an application for a State motor vehicle \nlicense may not require any information that duplicates information required in the \ndriver’s license portion of the form.” The statute further states that “Any change of \naddress form submitted in accordance with State law for purposes of a State motor \nvehicle driver’s license shall serve as a notification of change of address for voter \nregistration.” Texas does not appear to comply with the statute when customers \ncomplete transactions online.  Moreover, the process has generated confusion among \nTexans, with hundreds or thousands of inquiries or complaints recorded with DPS.11 \n21. Even though the Texas DPS does not share information with the SOS about a voter’s \nnew address, the DPS does inform election officials on a nightly basis that voters are \nno longer at their old address (if they registered a change of address). By obtaining \ndaily information that an old address may no longer be valid for a voter, election \nofficials may be able to gain insight into obsolete records on the voter rolls, which in \nturn they may purge. By not similarly obtaining information through a daily \ntransaction about new addresses, election officials are less likely to learn about a \ncurrent registrant’s new address.  \n22. Importantly, DPS prefers eligible license holders to use the online portal rather than \ncome into a DPS branch office. As DPS representative Sheri Gipson notes, use of the \nonline system “reduces traffic within the office and reduces overall wait times.”12 \nDPS promotes the use of its online system through online advertisements. Use of \n                                                           \n10 52 U.S.C. § 20504 \n11 See Deposition of Sheri Gipson, January 31, 2017, pp. 290-293. See also Exhibit C, page 7, of Case \n5:16-cv-00257-OLG, Document 1-4, Filed March 14, 2016. \n12 See 30(b)(6) deposition of Sheri Gipson, March 7, 2017, p. 96:20-25. See also Exhibit Y to 30(b)(6) \ndeposition of Sheri Gipson. \n  9 \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 67-1   Filed 06/06/17   Page 10 of 16\nonline transactions is also likely to increase. According to Ms. Gipson, there are two \nto three times as many transactions now than just a few years ago. Currently, only \nabout 30% of eligible license-holders are utilizing the online system. It is reasonable \nto expect, particularly with DPS’s deliberate advertising campaign, that use of the \nonline system will increase.13  \nIV.  Reasons Why DPS does not Transmit Certain Data from Online Transactions to \nSOS \nA.  Technical challenges do not prevent DPS from transmitting data to SOS \n \n23. There are a number of reasons why interactions between the online DPS system and \nSOS might, theoretically, differ from the offline system. One could imagine a number \nof reasons a state might argue that it is burdensome to transfer voter registration \ninformation to SOS in the same manner online as it does in person. For example, it is \nconceivable that a state could exclusively rely on a paper-record transfer for \ninteractions between a state motor vehicle authority and an election office that would \nnot be easy to adapt to an online record.  As another example, it is conceivable that \npersonal identifiers necessary to link DPS records to SOS records are not the same in \nonline and offline systems or that the systems are incompatible. If there were \ntechnical obstacles like these, there would likely be an added financial cost associated \nwith transferring records from an online system. Thus, a state may argue that costs \npresent a challenge.  \n24. However, in reviewing depositions by John Crawford, manager of license services \napplication for DPS and by Sheri Gipson, Deputy Assistant Director of Headquarters \nOperations at DPS, it is apparent that in the case of Texas there are not obvious \n                                                           \n13 See Deposition of Sheri Gipson, January 31, 2017, pp. 288:12-289:23. \n  10 \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 67-1   Filed 06/06/17   Page 11 of 16\ntechnical challenges (except for one as described below) that prevent DPS from \nsharing registration updates with SOS. All that is required is for DPS to obtain \ninformation from Texas.gov’s vendor, NIC and to send it to SOS. Customers already \nsubmit a response on Texas.gov indicating whether they would like to register to \nvote. NIC could then transmit data to DPS of individuals who request the updates to \ntheir voter record. Once DPS has this information, it could transmit updated \nregistration information to SOS just as it processes the information when it comes via \nin-person transactions. \n25. Ms. Gipson, in her 30(b)(6) deposition, confirmed that DPS could inform NIC that \nDPS would like to receive the information about whether an individual requested to \nupdate their voter registration information (p.207:1-18). In his deposition, Mr. \nCrawford confirmed that DPS could store the information (p. 92:14-19). In her \ndeposition, Erin Hutchins, of Texas NIC, also confirmed that there is no technical \nobstacle to NIC transmitting the information to DPS (p.120:21-121:3). It is already \nclear that DPS has the capability of transmitting updates electronically on a daily \nbasis to election officials. Thus, the basis of the decision not to send registration \nupdates from online transactions is a policy decision based on an interpretation of \nstatute rather a logistical decision based on technical capacity. Because the technical \ncapacity is already in place, it does not appear the cost would be significant. In \nprinciple, online transmission of registration updates should be a cost savings for \nelection officials. Consider that under the current system, many individuals who \nchange their address online through the Texas.gov portal must separately update their \nvoter registration record through an application that must be keyed into a computer \n  11 \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 67-1   Filed 06/06/17   Page 12 of 16\nsystem by an election official. The costs savings of automation is the most important \nreason why governments and industry have moved to automation for so many \nfunctions. Automation would almost surely save time and money for Texas state and \ncounty officials in this context. \nB. Electronic Transmission of Signatures is Feasible in Texas \n26. SOS claims one plausible technical hurdle with respect to being able to accept new or \namended voter registration records that originate from an online portal. Mr. Keith \nIngram, Texas Director of Elections, argued that a voter registration application was \nrequired to be signed.14 In the online system currently used by the state, no digital \nsignature is obtained from a user. Instead, users authenticate their identity by entering \nin personal information such as part of their social security number and identifiers \nlisted on their drivers’ licenses. \n27. While the state argues that it cannot comply with the signature requirement in its \nonline system, the Secretary of State does process voter registration applications \nwithout obtaining signature information in other settings, such as the case of change-\nof-address applications submitted to DPS via mail. When an individual submits \nchange of address information by mail, they sign the change-of-address form. \nHowever, when the form is processed by DPS, DPS transmits to SOS a previously-\nobtained digital signature that has been stored on file. Because all license holders \nhave performed an in-person transaction (e.g. to obtain their original license), DPS \nhas signatures for all license holders on file. When an individual changes their \naddress by mail, DPS transmits the old electronic signature on file. This process has \nbeen described in depositions by DPS’s John Crawford and Sheri Gipson and has also \n                                                           \n14 Deposition of Keith Ingram, March 22, 2017, p. 102:15-24. \n  12 \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 67-1   Filed 06/06/17   Page 13 of 16\nbeen acknowledged by Betsy Schonhoff, the voter registration manager for the \nSecretary of State. In fact, Mr. Crawford notes that the Secretary of State’s office \nwould not necessarily know if a signature transmitted from DPS was signed \nconcurrently when the registration information was updated (as in an in-person \ntransaction) or signed in years prior (as in a by-mail transaction) (p.102:24-103:6).  \n28. Texas’ differential treatment of mail transactions and online transactions is not the \nresult of a technical hurdle. Texas clearly admits previously-recorded digital \nsignatures as valid signatures for voter registration applications that come through \nmail change-of-address forms to DPS, but Texas does not admit previously-recorded \ndigital signatures as valid signatures for online transactions. According to depositions, \nthe state is technically able to a.) determine whether a user who is submitting an \nonline renewal or change-of-address process would like to update registration \ninformation, b.) transmit the updates to SOS as part of its daily registration file, and \nc.) pass on to SOS a previously recorded digital signature that it has on file. Again, \nthe state’s decision not to perform this function for online transactions appears to be \nthe result of a policy decision rather than a technical limitation.  \n29. Moreover, the policy decision in this context is different from the state’s position on \nonline authentication for state purposes, as in the case of the policy to use TOAS \nauthentication for non-DPS transactions (see again Texas Government Code \n2054.271) and to use a real-time authentication for DPS transactions. As Judge Garcia \nnotes in his March 31, 2017 order, “defendants deemed these [online authentication] \nsubmissions sufficient to update drivers’ license information – transactions that state \nlaw also requires to be verified by an applicant’s signature (p. 15).”  The state’s \n  13 \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 67-1   Filed 06/06/17   Page 14 of 16\npolicy decision is also inconsistent with the state’s position on online authentication \nfor federal purposes, as in the case of Texas’s compliance with the Truth in Mileage \nAct as reported above. \n30. Signatures can be used as a form of authentication, to ensure that an individual is not \npresenting themselves as a different person. However, authentication does not seem \nto be the purpose of signatures in DPS. For instance, when a new digital signature is \ncaptured in an in-person transaction, DPS does not appear to use signature \nverification or matching software to determine if the captured signature matches a \nprevious signature. Additionally, DPS processes online transactions without \nsignatures. As mentioned above, the Secretary of State also processes transactions \nwithout concurrent signatures as well, so long as it has a signature on file.  \n31. SOS receives from DPS an electronic signature for all registrants including those who \noriginally registered in person at a DPS office. County election officials can then \naccess the information to generate a voter registration form using the information on \nfile, including the electronic signature (Ingram depo p. 47:16-48:12).  The county can \nuse this signature if it is deemed necessary to compare with a voter's signature \nobtained at the polls. As Judge Garcia notes in his order, “It is unclear why an \nadditional signature provided with a change of address form is necessary to enable \ncomparison between the signature provided at the time of initial registration and the \nsignature provided at the polls. (p. 16).” Indeed, Texas SOS does not make use of an \nadditional signature in the case of mail forms or in-county online forms.  \n32. Conclusion \n  14 \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 67-1   Filed 06/06/17   Page 15 of 16\n33. Based on my reading of the testimony cited above, it does not seem that there are \nsubstantial technical (and therefore financial) barriers to DPS transmitting registration \ninformation to the SOS from online transactions. In fact, automation in this setting, as \nin other domains, would likely generate cost savings. DPS could comply with the \nNVRA when customers transact online by simply instructing Texas.gov to collect the \nanswer to the voter registration question and then transmitting such information along \nwith a previously captured digital signature to SOS. In short, Texas could choose to \ntreat the online response to the voter registration question in the same manner it treats \nthe in-person response. Such a transmission from DPS to SOS would be consistent \nwith how DPS currently transmits information from mail-in change of address forms. \nFurthermore, DPS already transmits digital signatures, even when a customer \nregisters to vote during a driver license transaction at a DPS office. The reason that \nDPS does not transmit information from online transactions does not appear to be \nprimarily about signatures, costs, or about other technical hurdles, but rather it is \nbased on the established policy for how DPS, in conjunction with SOS, interprets the \nTexas election statute and the National Voter Registration Act. In my view, Texas’ \npolicy for not incorporating voter registration updates into its online DPS transactions \nis inconsistent with the language of the NVRA. \nI reserve the right to amend my report as discovery is not yet complete. \n \nDATED this 15th Day of April, 2017 \n  15 \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 67-1   Filed 06/06/17   Page 16 of 16\n________________________ \n              Eitan Hersh \n  16 ",

Because no genuine issue of fact remains in dispute, it is appropriate for the \nCourt to enter judgment as a matter of law, and to do so in Defendants’ favor. \nARGUMENT & AUTHORITY \nI.  Plaintiffs’ response to Defendants’ Summary Judgment Motion does not establish \nstanding. \n \nA.  There is no evidence that Woods’ rights were impacted in any federal election, \nproviding an independent basis that he lacks standing under the NVRA. \n \nRemarkably, Plaintiffs claim “[t]hat Dr. Woods was subsequently registered to vote for \nfederal elections following his attempt to cast a ballot in a state election does not negate his original \ninjury under the NVRA.” Doc. 85 (citing Arcia v. Fla. Sec’y of State, 772 F.3d 1335, 1341 (11th Cir. \n2014)). But this is precisely the consequence of Woods’ failure to present “evidence of [] problems \n                                                 \n1 On Friday, August 4, 2017, counsel mistakenly filed an incorrect document as Defendants’ Reply in Support of Motion \nfor Summary Judgment. After conferring with the Court and opposing counsel, counsel files this corrected version, which \nhas not been changed since August 4, other than the addition of this footnote, and the date on the Certificate of Service. \n1 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 89   Filed 08/07/17   Page 2 of 12\nthat affected [his] right to vote in a federal election.” Broyles v. Texas, 618 F. Supp. 2d 661, 691 (S.D. \nTex. 2009). It is not enough, as Plaintiffs assert, for Woods to assert “injury under the NVRA.” Doc. \n85 at 4. He must specifically claim interference with his rights in a federal election, and that claim \nmust be supported by evidence. E.g., Young v. Fordice, 520 U.S. 273, 275-76 (1997). Woods has \nmade no such claim, and presented no such evidence, here. Doc. 1 ¶49; Doc. 82-1 Ex. C, Woods’ \nResp. to RFA 15 (“there was no federal general election in Texas in 2015.”). \nB.  Plaintiffs have not satisfied the notice and opportunity to cure requirement of the \nNVRA’s remedial scheme.  \n \nPlaintiffs’  standing  arguments  demonstrate  confusion  about  the  nature  of  Article  III \njurisdiction. Plaintiffs assert standing as follows: “because the State failed to update Plaintiffs’ voter \nregistration for elections for federal office after each indicated they wished to register to vote during \nan online driver’s license transaction, they have been ‘aggrieved by a violation’ of the NVRA.” Doc. \n85.2 They argue that “each Plaintiff…was injured at the moment the State failed to provide a \nsimultaneous voter registration application with an online driver’s license transaction.” Id. (citing \nDkt. 25 at 4). But as Defendants have briefed and as the record proves, Plaintiffs do not meet the \nnotice and opportunity to cure requirements of the NVRA’s remedial scheme, because any alleged \nviolations of that statute were cured within the applicable notice period.3 The additional arguments \n                                                 \n2 Even if this assertion were sufficient to establish NVRA standing, it finds no support in the factual record. No Plaintiff \nclaims to have submitted a written, signed request to update his voter registration information between counties, which \nTexas law requires in order to update voter registration information. See Doc. 86, Response to Plaintiffs’ Statement of \nFacts and citations therein. Even if Texas law did not impose such a requirement, or were preempted, no Plaintiff has \npresented actual evidence that he did, in fact, “indicate [he] wished to register to vote during an online driver’s license \ntransaction.” Doc. 85. By contrast, the record contains evidence that each Plaintiffs indicated, in changing his address \nonline, that said change “was not for voter registration purposes.” See, e.g., Doc. 1-2, Ex. A at 2 (each Plaintiff \nacknowledged that “[s]electing ‘Yes’ does not register you to vote.”) Cf. 52 U.S.C. §20504(d) (“[a]ny change of address \nform submitted in accordance with State law for purposes of a State motor vehicle driver’s license shall serve as \nnotification of change of address for voter registration with respect to elections for Federal office for the registrant \ninvolved unless the registrant states on the form that the change of address is not for voter registration purposes.”) \n(emphasis supplied). It further contains evidence that no Plaintiff signed a request to register, or update registration \ninformation, when moving between counties. Hernandez Depo. 39:10-15; Stringer Depo. 49:1-9; Woods Depo. 74:12-\n75:7. Cf. Doc. 86, Response to Plaintiffs’ Statement of Facts and citations therein. \n3 See, e.g., Docs. 82 at 12-15; 86 at 4-8. \n2 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 89   Filed 08/07/17   Page 3 of 12\nPlaintiffs raise in response to Defendants’ summary judgment motion also fail. \nPlaintiffs disregard Scott, commenting that their allegations involve “Section 5 of the NVRA, \na provision of the statute wholly distinct from that which was addressed in Scott.” Doc. 85 at 5. This \nignores the fact that the NVRA’s presuit notice requirement—upon which Congress conditioned the \nprivate right of action—is the same regardless of the section of the NVRA under which a private \nplaintiff wishes to sue. This limited waiver of the immunity that Defendants otherwise enjoy4 plainly \ngoverns private claims under the entire NVRA: “[a] person who is aggrieved by a violation of this \nchapter may provide written notice of the violation to the chief election official of the State involved.” \n52 U.S.C. §20510(b)(1) (emphasis supplied). If, and only “[i]f the violation is not corrected within 90 \ndays after receipt of a notice” may “the aggrieved person may bring a civil action in an appropriate \ndistrict court for declaratory or injunctive relief.” Id. §20510(b)(2). And such suit is expressly \nlimited—the private plaintiff may only file suit “with respect to the violation” in the notice. Id. \nPlaintiffs also assert that requiring them to satisfy the presuit requirements of the NVRA’s \nremedial scheme “frustrates Congress’s intent to create a private right of action.” Doc 85 at 5 (citation \nomitted). The opposite is true. It is Plaintiffs, not Defendants, who would eliminate Congress’ explicit \nrequirement that states have notice and an opportunity to cure before facing litigation under the \nNVRA. Contra Scott v. Schedler, 771 F.3d 831, 836 (5th Cir. 2014) (emphasizing that Plaintiff Scott \nlacked standing because putative notice did not “provide Schedler with ‘an opportunity to attempt \ncompliance’ as to Scott ‘before facing litigation.”) (citation omitted) (emphasis supplied).5 \n                                                 \n4 See, e.g., Docs. 82 at 13; 86 at 5-8. \n5 See also Ga. State Conf. of NAACP v. Kemp, 841 F. Supp. 2d 1320, 1335-36 (N.D. Ga. 2012) (citing ACORN v. Miller, \n129 F.3d 833, 838 (6th Cir. 1997)). Defendants are mindful that the Court distinguished Kemp insofar as “defendants in \nthat case did not learn of [plaintiff Murphy’s] claim until service of the complaint.” Doc. 52 at 9. Defendants cite Kemp \nhere to the extent that it emphasizes the individualized, plaintiff-specific nature of NVRA standing. The Northern District \nof Georgia that “Georgia ha[d] attempted to comply with” the NVRA “insofar as Murphy was aggrieved,” and \nemphasized “the State of Georgia’s attempt to comply with the NVRA with regard to Murphy” in assessing his standing. \n841 F. Supp. 2d at 1335, 1336 (emphasis supplied). \n3 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 89   Filed 08/07/17   Page 4 of 12\nPlaintiffs’ discussion of cases involving organizational standing further emphasizes their \nmisunderstanding of standing doctrine. Defendants do not—as Plaintiffs imagine—dispute Plaintiffs’ \nstanding “because they are not organizational plaintiffs.” Doc. 85 at 6. And Plaintiffs do not claim \nthat “only organizational plaintiffs may seek relief that benefits others.” Doc. 85 at 6. Rather, \norganizational standing is a type of standing that exists separate and apart from individual standing. \nFor example, “‘an organization has standing to sue on its own behalf where it devotes resources to \ncounteract a defendant’s allegedly unlawful practices.’” Scott, 771 F.3d at 837 (quoting ACORN v. \nFowler, 178 F.3d 350, 360 (5th Cir. 1999)). Similarly, “[a]n association has standing to bring suit on \nbehalf of its members when its members would otherwise have standing to sue in their own right, the \ninterests at stake are germane to the organization’s purpose, and neither the claim asserted nor the \nrelief requested requires the participation of individual members in the lawsuit.” Friends of the Earth, \nInc. v. Laidlaw Envtl. Servs., Inc., 528 U.S. 167, 181 (2000). \nPlaintiffs here are individuals, not organizations, and do not claim to have organizational \nstanding. As the record shows, no Plaintiff has established individual standing in his own right. See \nDocs. 82 at 12-19; 86 at 5-12. As such, these Plaintiffs are “not entitled to seek relief for others.” \nScott, 771 F.3d at 836. The issue is not who Plaintiffs believe will benefit from the relief requested. \nContra Doc. 85 at 6 (“nothing in the NVRA or Scott prevents Plaintiffs from requesting injunctive \nrelief that would benefit millions of other Texans.”) Rather, the issue is Plaintiffs’ failure to meet \ntheir burden to establish the Court’s jurisdiction. \nPlaintiffs read the NVRA’s opportunity to cure requirement out of the statute—and read the \nfact that the any NVRA violation alleged here was cured out of the record—based upon Arcia v. \nFlorida Secretary of State, 772 F.3d 1335, 1341 (11th Cir. 2014). Plaintiffs describe Arcia as “finding \nthat individual voters removed from the rolls in violation of Section 8 of the NVRA had standing to \nsue for prospective relief even after they were reinstated.” Doc. 85 at 4. But Arcia neither binds this \n4 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 89   Filed 08/07/17   Page 5 of 12\nCourt nor supports Plaintiffs’ standing, because the Arcia defendants did not contest that the plaintiffs \nhad satisfied the NVRA’s notice and opportunity to cure requirements. See generally, Arcia v. Fla. \nSec’y of State, 772 F.3d 1335; Arcia v. Detzner, 2012 WL 12845178 (S.D. Fla. October 12, 2012). \nC.  Plaintiffs have not established Article III standing. \nPlaintiffs assert that “Defendants challenge only causation and rederessability,” and do not \ncontest that Plaintiffs have an injury in fact. Doc. 85 at 7. This ignores dozens of pages of briefing in \nthis cause, which explain why Plaintiffs have not suffered an injury in fact because (1) the NVRA is \nnot being violated, and because even if it were, (2) Plaintiffs have not been aggrieved by those \nviolations within the meaning of the NVRA. E.g., Docs. 82 at 19-24; 86 at 12-20; 7. Defendants \nreiterate their arguments that Plaintiffs have not suffered an injury in fact sufficient to confer standing.  \nPlaintiffs also cannot establish causation.  The only authority Plaintiffs offer to support \ncausation is the Court’s ruling on Defendants’ motion to dismiss. Doc. 85 at 7.6 Now, on summary \njudgment, the evidence defeats causation, because no Plaintiff has presented evidence to separate \nalleged lack of updated registration from his own failure to heed the requirement to submit a written \nsigned request for such update, made plain during the online process. Hernandez Depo. 39:10-15; \nStringer Depo. 49:1-9; Woods Depo. 74:12-75:7;7 see also, e.g., Doc. 52 at 1. \nPlaintiffs’ own authority demonstrates that their inaction severs the required causal link. The \nindividual plaintiffs in Arcia, for example, were improperly removed from Florida voter rolls because \nFlorida erroneously identified them as non-citizens due to a faulty data-matching process. 772 F.3d \nat 1341. These individuals had standing because, through no action or inaction on their part, they \nwere removed from the rolls, and without changes to Florida’s flawed data-matiching process, might \n                                                 \n6 Throughout their response to Defendants’ summary judgment motion, Plaintiffs’ improperly treat the Court’s ruling on \nDefendants’ Motion to Dismiss as dispositive at this summary judgment stage. \n7 Deposition citations herein refer to the proof filed with Defendants’ summary judgment motion, Doc. 82-1. \n5 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 89   Filed 08/07/17   Page 6 of 12\nbe removed again. 772 F.3d at 1341. This is distinct from the failure of Plaintiffs here to submit a \nrequest to change their voter registration in writing, and signed.  \nAs Plaintiffs’ failure to marshal any on point caselaw suggests, Plaintiffs are—in effect—\nseeking an impermissible advisory opinion. They at least implicitly concede as much in arguing that \n“numerous individual plaintiffs have brought suit successfully under the NVRA since its enactment \nin 1993, achieving injunctive relief that has led to policy change.” Doc. 85 at 6 (citing Arcia v. Fla. \nSec’y of State, 772 F.3d 1335, 1341 (11th Cir. 2014); Arizona v. Inter Tribal Council of Arizona, Inc., \n133 S.Ct. 2247, 2252 (2013)). As set forth above, Arcia is distinguishable on multiple grounds. And \nin Arizona v. Inter Tribal Council, there was a direct conflict between State and federal law, which—\nas set forth in the next section—does not exist here. \nII.  The NVRA does not preempt any provision of Texas law that is relevant here, \nbecause there is no direct conflict. \n \nPlaintiffs have not, until their summary judgment motion, argued preemption (and have not \nmeaningfully briefed the issue to date), so Defendants address it here. See Doc. 85 at 13-15. The \nElections Clause “‘functions as a default provision; it invests the States with responsibility for the \nmechanics  of  congressional  elections,  but  only  so  far  as  Congress  declines  to  pre-empt  state \nlegislative choices.’” Arizona v. Inter Tribal Council of Arizona, Inc., 133 S.Ct. at 2253 (quoting \nFoster v. Love, 522 U.S. 67, 69 (1997)). Congress may enact laws that preempt state election laws \nconcerning federal elections, but such preemption occurs only to the extent that state laws “directly \nconflict with federal election laws on the subject.” Voting for Am., Inc. v. Steen, 732 F.3d 382, 399 \n(5th Cir. 2013) (citations and quotation marks omitted). Plaintiffs fail to establish that there is any \ndirect conflict between the NVRA and Texas law sufficient to preempt any State law relevant here.8 \nPlaintiffs assert that (1) the NVRA’s “in accordance with State law” requirement applies only \n                                                 \n8 Defendants also note that Plaintiffs have not pleaded any challenge to any provision of Texas law. See Doc. 1.  \n6 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 89   Filed 08/07/17   Page 7 of 12\nto driver license transactions, and not to voter registration transactions, and (2) a customer who \nrenews his driver license or changes his address online has done so in accordance with State law. \nThus, Plaintiffs reason, online transactions must result in new registrations or updates to voter \nregistration information, otherwise they violate the NVRA. Doc. 85 at 13. Based upon this reasoning, \nPlaintiffs argue that Texas’ requirement that a customer submit a signature when requesting a new \nvoter registration or update to his voter registration, absent statutory exception, “is inconsistent \nwith—and therefore pre-empted by—the NVRA.” Doc. 85 at 14 (citing 52 U.S.C. §20504, Dkt. 52 \nat 11, 14). Plaintiffs insist that “neither the NVRA nor Texas law requires that these online driver’s \nlicense change-of-address notifications include a signature,” and therefore claim that “Defendants’ \ninsistence upon one is a plain violation of the NVRA.” Doc. 85 at 15. \nThis does not establish the “direct conflict” necessary to find preemption. Rather, “the \nreasonable assumption is that the statutory text accurately communicates the scope of Congress’s pre-\nemptive intent.” Arizona Inter Tribal Council, 133 S. Ct. at 2257. Here, it is undisputed that the \nNVRA itself requires a signature for each voter registrant and is silent on the procedure for obtaining \nsuch signatures. 52 U.S.C. §20504(a)(1); (c)(2)(C)(iii). Texas law provides the procedure for such \nsignatures.  Texas  Election  Code  §§13.002(b)  and  15.021(a)  make  clear  that  voter  registration \napplications and changes of address must be “in writing and signed by the applicant” unless a specific \nenumerated statutory exception applies. These include (1) in county changes of address through \nTexas.gov, as provided for under §15.021(d), and (2) the transmission of an electronic signature when \na physical signature is also provided when the applicant makes an in person or mail with DPS, as \nprovided for under §20.066(a).9 None of these provisions directly conflicts with the NVRA.  \n                                                 \n9 “If a person completes a voter registration application as provided by Section 20.063, the Department of Public Safety \nshall: (1) input the information provided on the application into the department's electronic data system; and (2) inform \nthe applicant that the applicant's electronic signature provided to the department will be used for submitting the applicant's \nvoter registration application” \n7 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 89   Filed 08/07/17   Page 8 of 12\nPlaintiffs acknowledge that, “under state law, a voter registration application must be in \nwriting and signed by the applicant.” Doc. 85 at 15 n.52 (citing Dkt. 82 at 8-10). Plaintiffs complain \nthat this “ignores the fact that DPS customers do not, in fact, actually sign a voter registration form.” \nId. But this is precisely the point—unless a customer makes a written, signed request or an exception \napplies—State law does not authorize changes to the voter rolls in the context of these transactions. \nPlaintiffs cannot show that this is in direct conflict with the NVRA.10 \nIII.  Plaintiffs’ Equal Protection challenge fails under Anderson-Burdick or any other \nstandard. \n \nPlaintiffs claim that Anderson-Burdick governs their Equal Protection claim, and that under \nAnderson-Burdick, they need not identify a similarly situated comparator to prevail. Doc. 85 at 16 \nBut the Equal Protection clause requires a Plaintiff to plead and prove State interference with a \nfundamental right—under Anderson-Burdick, in the context of an election. Plaintiffs have not done \nso here, nor have they challenged any Texas law under the Equal Protection Clause. See Doc. 1. \nThat is, Plaintiffs have identified no authority for the proposition that a process which treats \nall similarly situated voters the same way violates Equal Protection—under Anderson-Burdick or any \nother standard. Doc. 85 at 16-17 Anderson v. Celebrezze, for example, was a First Amendment ballot \naccess challenge to an Ohio law setting an early filing deadline for independent candidates based on \nthe associational rights of their supporters. 460 U.S. 780 (1983). In finding an Equal Protection \nviolation through the First Amendment, the Court explicitly did not engage in a separate Equal \nProtection analysis. 460 U.S. at 786 n.7 (1983). Burdick v. Takushi found that Hawaii’s statutory \nprohibition on write-in voting did not violate a voter’s First Amendment right to remain free from \nespousing positions he did not support, and did not raise any Equal Protection claim at all. 504 U.S. \n                                                 \n10 Even if there were a direct conflict between Texas law and the NVRA, the NVRA sets out the exclusive remedial \nscheme for violations thereof, so this case must be dismissed for want for jurisdiction. See infra part I(B); Doc. 86 at 5-\n8. \n8 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 89   Filed 08/07/17   Page 9 of 12\n428, 438 (1992).11 And in Obama for America v. Husted, the Sixth Circuit concluded that plaintiffs \nwere likely to succeed on the merits of their Equal Protection challenge to an Ohio law setting a \ndifferent early voting deadline for military and non-military voters. 697 F.3d at 432. Applying a \n“clearly erroneous” standard, the court noted that “[b]ecause the district court found that Plaintiffs’ \nright to vote was burdened, it properly applied the Anderson-Burdick standard.” Id. at 431.12 \nCrawford v. Marion County Election Board is particularly instructive. 553 U.S. 181 (2008). \nThere, the Court rejected an Equal Protection challenge to Indiana’s photo ID requirement, noting \nthat “the inconvenience of making a trip to the BMV, gathering the required documents, and posing \nfor a photograph surely does not qualify as a substantial burden on the right to vote, or even represent \na significant increase over the usual burdens of voting.” 553 U.S. at 198. The Court reached this result \ndespite the fact that “a somewhat heavier burden may be placed on a limited number of persons,” \nincluding “elderly persons born out of State, who may have difficulty obtaining a birth certificate; \npersons who because of economic or other personal limitations may find it difficult either to secure a \ncopy of their birth certificate or to assemble the other required documentation to obtain a state-issued \nidentification; homeless persons; and persons with a religious objection to being photographed.” Id.13 \nPlaintiffs’ final citation in support of their Equal Protection claim—Northeast Ohio Coalition \nfor the Homeless v. Husted—is also instructive here, insofar as the Court determines that Anderson-\nBurdick is the appropriate standard. 696 F.3d 580 (6th Cir. 2012). Applying Anderson-Burdick, the \n                                                 \n11 The Court did note in Burdick that it had “previously ejected an equal protection challenge to a system that provided \nalternative means of ballot access for members of established political parties and other candidates, concluding that the \nsystem was constitutional because it did not operate to freeze the political status quo.” 504 U.S. at 437 n.4 (citing Jenness \nv. Fortson, 403 U.S. 431, 438 (1971). \n12 The court went on to note that rational basis is appropriate for generally applicable, nondiscriminatory election \nregulations. Id. at n.4 (citations omitted). \n13 Even if Anderson did apply, a plaintiff must demonstrate the propriety of the remedy requested. Crawford, 553 U.S. at \n203 (where “petitioners have not demonstrated that the proper remedy—even assuming an unjustified burden on some \nvoters—would be to invalidate the entire statute. When evaluating a neutral, nondiscriminatory regulation of voting \nprocedure, [w]e must keep in mind that [a] ruling of unconstitutionality frustrates the intent of the elected representatives \nof the people.”) (citations and quotation marks omitted) (alterations original). \n9 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 89   Filed 08/07/17   Page 10 of 12\nSixth Circuit found that an organizational plaintiff was likely to prevail on the merits of its Equal \nProtection challenge for voters who cast their ballots in the right polling location but wrong precinct \ndue to poll worker error. 696 F.3d at 597. By contrast, it found that the same plaintiff was not likely \nto succeed on its Equal Protection challenge to Ohio’s statutory ballot affirmation requirement where \n“all of the identified deficiencies arise from voters’ failure to follow the form’s rather simple \ninstructions: (1) print name, (2) provide identification, and (3) sign the affirmation appearing at the \nbottom.” 696 F.3d at 599-600 (citations omitted).  \nFinally, the Equal Protection Clause involves interference with fundamental rights. Plaintiffs \ndo not allege that Texans have a fundamental right to submit inter-county changes to their voter \nregistration information over the internet. And as the Court has noted, nothing in the NVRA requires \nDefendants to accept renewals and changes of address over the internet. Doc. 52 at 20. Thus, the \nappropriate standard is rational basis review, where the “question before [the Court] is whether there \nis any conceivable rational basis justifying this distinction.” Plaintiffs have not put forward any \nevidence that this contemporaneous signature requirement is arbitrary or unreasonable. \n Finally, regardless of the standard, the State’s interests in requiring a voter to submit a written, \nsigned request to update voter registration between counties is justified, in light of its minimal burden. \nThe burden is slight—signing and mailing in a form is, in some ways, even less burdensome than \nmaking an in-person visit to a DPS office, and in any event can hardly be said to be more onerous \nthan the regular burdens of voting. See Crawford, 553 U.S. at 198. Moreover, As briefed in this case \nand as shown on the record, the process Plaintiffs challenge here serves Defendants’ interest in \ncomplying with State law and the NVRA, maintaining county-based voter rolls, and allowing \nsignatures to be compared when there is a potential problem. It also allows Defendants to serve the \nmaximum number of driver license customers as efficiently and effectively as possible, by reducing \nwait times in DPS field offices. \n10 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 89   Filed 08/07/17   Page 11 of 12\nCONCLUSION  \nDefendants respectfully move the to enter summary judgment in their favor. \nRespectfully submitted, \n             \n              KEN PAXTON \nAttorney General of Texas \n \nJEFFREY C.

Plaintiffs have established a strong likelihood of success on the merits, including a \nstrong likelihood of success in establishing standing to seek their requested relief. \nDefendants’ Response to Plaintiffs’ Emergency Application for a Preliminary Injunction \n(“Resp.”) contends that Plaintiffs have not established a likelihood of success on the merits, but it \ndoes  not  actually  address  any  of  the  facts  or  legal  arguments  that  Stringer  II  Plaintiffs \nindependently raise in their Emergency Application for a Preliminary Injunction (“Application”).1 \nDefendants’ only substantive attempt to address the merits is an oblique reference to Stringer I \nPlaintiffs’  lack  of  standing  under  different  circumstances.  Individual,  Organizational,  and \nAssociational Plaintiffs in Stringer II fit squarely within Fifth Circuit standing caselaw. \n“To have Article III standing, a plaintiff must show an injury in fact that is fairly traceable \nto the challenged action of the defendant and likely to be redressed by the plaintiff’s requested \nrelief.” Stringer v. Whitley, 942 F.3d 715, 720 (5th Cir. 2019) (citing Lujan v. Defs. of Wildlife, \n504 U.S. 555, 560-61 (1992)). These elements are commonly broken down into three distinct \ncomponents: (i) injury-in-fact; (ii) causation; and (iii) redressability. Id. The injury-in-fact must be \n“(2) ‘concrete and particularized,’ not abstract; and (3) ‘actual or imminent, not ‘conjectural’ or \n‘hypothetical.’” Id. (citing Susan B. Anthony List, 573 U.S. 149, 158 (2014)). Additionally, to have \nstanding for declaratory and injunctive relief, Plaintiffs must suffer a continuing injury-in-fact or \nfuture injury-in-fact rather than a past injury. Id (citing City of Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95, \n105  (1983)).  All  Plaintiffs—individual,  organizational,  and  associational—suffer  continuing \ninjuries  directly  caused  by  Defendants’  failure  to  allow  simultaneous  voter  registration \n \n1 Due to the complicated posture of the present case, we respectfully ask the Court to make an \nindependent ruling on the likelihood of success on the merits as it pertains to the instant Plaintiffs, \nand to make its preliminary findings based solely on the record presented in Plaintiffs’ Application \nand this Reply.  \n2 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 44   Filed 01/28/20   Page 3 of 13\n \n \napplications with online driver’s license transactions. These injuries will be directly redressed by \nthe relief they seek. \nA.  Individuals have standing to pursue the preliminary and permanent relief they \nrequest because they suffer the continuing injury of not being registered to vote at their \ncorrect address.2 \n Plaintiffs Stringer, Gomez, and Harms all transacted with DPS online in order to update \ntheir driver’s licenses. Appendix to Plaintiffs’ Application for Preliminary Injunction (“1/17/20 \nApp’x”) at 178, ¶¶ 4-8; 185, ¶ 4; 182, ¶¶ 6-7. These transactions did not serve as simultaneous \napplications. Id. at 178, ¶¶ 4-8; 185, ¶ 5; 183, ¶ 9. As a result, at the time of filing and continuing \nthrough to present day, each Individual Plaintiff remains incorrectly registered to vote at the wrong \naddress. Declaration of Joaquin Gonzalez at ¶¶ 8-10 (attached hereto as Ex. 10). Plaintiffs Stringer \nand Harms are not even registered in the correct county. Needless to say, being not properly \nregistered to vote is a concrete injury because a person cannot fully exercise their franchise if they \nare  not  properly  registered  to  vote  in  their  correct  precinct.  See  United  States  v.  Students \nChallenging Regulatory Agency Procedures (SCRAP), 412 U.S. 669, 689 n.14 (1973) (noting that \nthe Court has upheld standing where plaintiffs have “no more at stake in the outcome of an action \nthan a fraction of a vote, . . . a $5 fine and costs, . . . and a $1.50 poll tax”) (internal citations \nomitted); Charles H. Wesley Educ. Found., Inc. v. Cox, 408 F.3d 1349, 1352 (11th Cir. 2005) \n(“[Plaintiff’s] alleged injuries flow directly from the denial of her registration form.”); Williams v. \nSalerno, 792 F.2d 323, 328 (2d Cir. 1986) (holding that the application of “more vigorous \nregistration requirements than are generally applied” constituted judicially cognizable injury). \n \n2 Although  all  Individual  Plaintiffs  suffer  the  same  injury,  Plaintiff  Harms’  online  driver’s \ntransaction occurred more than 120 days before a federal election, which may necessitate a longer \n90-day notice period rather than the 20-day notice period applicable to Plaintiffs Stringer and \nGomez. Though there is supportive caselaw suggesting exceptions to this timeline, to avoid \nprocedural complications at the preliminary stage, Plaintiff Harms moves for relief solely on his \nconstitutional claim.  \n3 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 44   Filed 01/28/20   Page 4 of 13\n \n \nSimply having to jump through an extraneous hoop to register to vote, in contravention of the \nNVRA,  itself  constitutes  an  injury-in-fact.  See  Warth  v.  Seldin,  422 U.S.  490,  514  (1975) \n(“Congress may create a statutory right or entitlement the alleged deprivation of which can confer \nstanding to sue . . . .”); see also Common Cause of Colorado v. Buescher, 750 F. Supp. 2d 1259, \n1271 (D. Colo. 2010). (“Any burden on the right to vote, even if it is no more than the cancellation \nof a voter's records in violation of the NVRA, constitutes an injury-in-fact for standing purposes.”). \nIndividual Plaintiffs’ injury is particularized rather than generalized because it applies to \nthem specifically as a result of their online driver’s license transactions and affects them personally. \nLujan v. Defs. of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 561 (1992). Their injuries will be redressed by the \nrequested relief. The preliminary relief requested—that they be properly registered to vote in time \nto vote in the March 3, 2020 Primary Election—will satisfy their current continuing injury.3  \nIn addition to the continuing injury of not being properly registered, Plaintiff Stringer faces \nan “imminent” threat of future injury because he has concrete plans to move no later than August \n25, 2020. 1/17/20 App’x at 179, ¶ 12. This differs from the non-Plaintiff specific, probabilistic \nfuture injury found insufficient in Stringer I. See Stringer, 942 F.3d at 721-23. \nB.  Organizational Plaintiffs have standing to pursue systemic relief because they divert \nresources from their regular activities to counteract Defendants’ legal violations. \n“[A]n organization has standing to sue on its own behalf where it devotes resources to \ncounteract a defendant’s allegedly unlawful practices.” ACORN v. Fowler, 178 F.3d 350, 360. If \na defendant’s actions perceptibly impair an organization in such a way, “there can be no question \nthat the organization has suffered injury in fact.” Havens Realty Corp. v. Coleman, 455 U.S. 363, \n379 (1982). “[T]he injury in fact requirement under Article III is qualitative, not quantitative, in \n \n3 Granting that relief will not moot out their request for a permanent injunction, as that inquiry \nonly requires plaintiffs to show “some cognizable danger of recurrent violation.” Shanks v. City of \nDallas, Tex., 752 F.2d 1092, 1097 (5th Cir. 1985). \n4 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 44   Filed 01/28/20   Page 5 of 13\n \n \nnature,” and “need not measure more than an ‘identifiable trifle.’” OCA-Greater Houston, 867 \nF.3d at 612 (citing Fowler, 178 F.3d at 357–58) (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted).  \nIn the instant case, Organizational Plaintiffs have demonstrated that they expend significant \nresources counteracting the states’ failures, thereby frustrating their organizational missions. Both \norganizational plaintiffs—MOVE Texas (“MOVE”) and the League of Women Voters of Texas \n(“LWVTX”)—suffer two distinct injuries-in-fact: First, they must register voters whose DPS \ntransactions should have acted as simultaneous voter registration applications when transacting \nwith DPS online. 1/17/20 App’x at 162-63, ¶ 10-11; 168-69, ¶ 4-5, 7-10; 173-74, ¶ 10-13; 189-\n192, ¶ 4, 10, 18, 19. They conduct voter registration drives in a variety of public forums, registering \ntens of thousands of voters over the course of a year. 1/17/20 App’x at 163-64, ¶ 6, 13; 167-68, ¶ \n3, 7. In particular, they register voters in regions where people frequently relocate from other Texas \ncounties. 1/17/20 App’x at 162, ¶ 5; 167-68, ¶¶ 1,3; 189-90, ¶¶ 3-5, 8, 12; 196-197, ¶¶ 4, 8. Both \nthe League and MOVE’s deputy registrars are active on college campuses in major metro areas, \nwhere they register students who recently moved to the area and were unable to apply to register \nthrough DPS online. See id. \nSecond,  Plaintiffs  divert  resources  to  educate  voters  who  mistakenly  thought  they \nregistered through DPS online.  See OCA-Greater Houston, 867 F.3d at 612 (Texas statute at issue \n“‘perceptibly impaired’ [the organization’s] ability to ‘get out the vote’” when the organization \n“went out of its way to counteract the effect of Texas’[] allegedly unlawful” statute by “educat[ing] \nvoters” on how to avoid being negatively impacted by the statute.”). It’s a virtually universal \nexperience that deputy voter registrars for these organizations come across people who mistakenly \nthought they applied to register or updated their voter registration when using DPS’s online \ndriver’s license system. 1/17/20 App’x at 189-91, ¶¶ 4, 8, 12, 18; 196, 197-98 at ¶¶ 5, 9, 10;163-\n5 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 44   Filed 01/28/20   Page 6 of 13\n \n \n64 at ¶¶ 11,13; 168-69 at ¶¶ 4-5, 7-8. Both MOVE and the League must check the voter registration \nstatuses of individuals who mistakenly believe they registered through DPS online, and spend time \nexplaining to those individuals that it is not possible to do so, and then re-register those individuals. \n1/17/20 App’x at 163-64, ¶¶ 11-12, 15; 168-69, ¶¶ 4-5, 10, 12; 189-90, ¶¶ 5, 9, 10; 196-98, ¶¶5-7, \n10. The League specifically spends time during public presentations educating the public about \nthe common misconception that individuals can register through online DPS transactions. 1/17/20 \nApp’x at 174, ¶ 12; 192, ¶¶ 20-23.  \nC.  Plaintiff LWVTX also has associational standing to seek systemic relief.  \nThe Plaintiff LWVTX has an identifiable member who would have standing to sue in their \nown right because she moved from Travis County to Harris County, changed the address on her \ndriver’s  license  online,  yet  remains  unregistered  to  vote  in  Harris  County.4 Supplemental \nDeclaration of Grace Chimene at ¶¶ 3-7 (attached hereto as Ex. 9). The interests of ensuring \ncompliance with the NVRA are germane to LWVTX’s purpose, see 1/17/20 App’x at 17, ¶ 3. and \nLWVTX’s requested injunctive relief can be granted without the participation of individual \nmembers.   \nII.  Plaintiffs have demonstrated numerous irreparable injuries which are amplified by the \ncoming federal elections. \n \nIn  the  Application,  each  Plaintiff  describes  multiple  irreparable  injuries  suffered  or \nthreatened by the State’s ongoing conduct and amplified by the upcoming election. See App. at \n \n4 To establish associational standing, Plaintiff LWVTX  must show:  \n(a) its members would otherwise have standing to sue in their own right; (b) the \ninterests it seeks to protect are germane to the organization’s purpose; and (c) \nneither the claim asserted nor the relief requested requires the participation of \nindividual members in the lawsuit.  \nHunt v. Wash. St. Apple Adver. Comm’n, 432 U.S. 333, 343 (1977). \n6 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 44   Filed 01/28/20   Page 7 of 13\n \n \n34-42. The Individual Plaintiffs are currently denied their rights to register in compliance with \nfederal law; if they are not registered to vote by Monday, February 3, they will also suffer the \nextraordinary injury of losing their right to vote in the upcoming primary election. The voter \nregistration, education and mobilization activities of the Organizational Plaintiffs are heightened \nin a federal election year and critical in the weeks before voter registration deadlines and voting \nperiods. See., e.g., 1/17/20 App’x at 164, ¶ 13; id. at 165, ¶ 15; id. at 174, ¶ 13; id. at 175, ¶ 18. \nDuring these times, the State’s unlawful practices are acutely disruptive for Organizational \nPlaintiffs, forcing them to divert scarce resources to  register and educate voters who were \nimproperly denied registration with drivers’ license transactions and dramatically undercutting \ntheir missions when they mobilize persons to vote who, as a result of the State’s failures, cannot \ncast a ballot that counts. Moreover, because Plaintiff LWVTX has individual members, it suffers \nadditional harms when its members’ rights are violated by the State’s practices.5  \n  Of course, nothing in  the State’s Response undermines the  extensive  factual  record \nPlaintiffs present in support of their claims of irreparable injury. See Resp. at 9-14. Instead, without \nciting any case law, the State suggests that the Individual Plaintiffs could be made whole by simply \nabandoning their statutory and constitutional rights to simultaneous voter registration and finding \nanother way to register before Monday’s deadline. This position overlooks extensive precedent \nconfirming that any “restriction on the fundamental right to vote . . . constitutes irreparable injury,” \nincluding unlawful burdens on the manner of registration or voting that will not necessarily cause \ndisenfranchisement. Obama for Am. v. Husted, 697 F.3d 423, 436 (6th Cir. 2012) (emphasis added) \n \n5 As noted, as of this filing, at least one LWVTX member remains unregistered to vote after \nmoving residences, updating her driver’s license address online with DPS, but being denied her \nright to simultaneous voter registration—threatening acute irreparable harm. 1/17/20 App’x at 175, \n¶ 17.     \n7 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 44   Filed 01/28/20   Page 8 of 13\n \n \n(issuing preliminary injunction against reduction in early voting days for certain voters); see also \nLeague of Women Voters of N. Carolina v. North Carolina, 769 F.3d 224, 247 (4th Cir. 2014) \n(finding that “[c]ourts routinely deem restrictions on fundamental voting rights irreparable injury” \nand upholding preliminary injunction of several state law practices); Williams v. Salerno, 792 F.2d \n323, 326 (2d Cir. 1986) (issuing preliminary injunction against rejecting student voter registration \nforms, even though most could presumably register at their parents’ home address). \n  The State also accuses the Organizational Plaintiffs of “substantial delay” in bringing this \nlawsuit, measured from when their organizations became aware of the State’s unlawful practices, \nand claims that this delay “precludes a finding of irreparable injury” on their behalf. Resp. at 10; \nsee also id. at 10-12. This argument fails too. First, the State relies on seven cases, all of which are \ninapposite. Indeed, five are trademark or patent cases and involve the very different situation of a \nplaintiff seeking to enjoin the business practices of a competitor on the grounds that such practices \nare hurting the plaintiff’s business.6 Under those very different fact patterns—which did not \ninvolve constitutionally protected rights—courts explained that a delay in bringing suit after the \ndiscovery of the alleged violation may undercut claim that money damages are insufficient.  \n  Second, far from sitting on their hands, Organizational Plaintiffs were closely watching the \nStringer I litigation and, in the meantime, taking significant measures to counteract the State’s \nunlawful practices. They initiated the instant lawsuit within weeks of the Fifth Circuit’s decision \n \n6 See High Tech Med. Instrumentation, Inc. v. New Image Indus., 49 F.3d 1551 (Fed. Cir. 1995); \nTough Traveler, Ltd. v. Outbound Prods., 60 F.3d 964 (2d Cir. 1995); Marks Org., Inc. v. Joles, \n784 F. Supp. 2d 322 (S.D.N.Y. 2011); GoNannies, Inc. v. GoAuPair, Inc., 464 F. Supp. 2d 603 \n(N.D. Tex. 2006); Kensington Partners v. Cordillera Ranch, Ltd., No. 98-121, 1998 WL 1782540 \n(W.D. Tex. June 16, 1998). Rimkus Consulting Grp., Inc. v. Cammarata, 255 F.R.D. 417 (S.D. \nTex.  2008)  involves  the  attempted  last-minute  enforcement  of  an  unenforceable  employee \nnoncompete agreement and Boire v. Pilot Freight Carriers, Inc., 515 F.2d 1185 (5th Cir. 1975) \narises under particular procedures dictated by the Taft-Hartley Act.  \n8 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 44   Filed 01/28/20   Page 9 of 13\n \n \nin Stringer I, when they became concerned that a new lawsuit was necessary to prevent irreparable \nharm in this critical election year. They then moved for this preliminary injunction within days. \nFinally, federal courts have repeatedly granted preliminary injunctive relief against longstanding \nstate election law, rejecting laches arguments. See, e.g., Democratic Exec. Comm. of Fla. v. Lee, \n915 F.3d 1312, 1326 (11th Cir. 2019) (refusing to stay preliminary injunction against mail-in-\nballot law, noting prior similar litigation as one reason for plaintiffs’ delay in bringing suit); Martin \nv. Kemp, 341 F. Supp. 3d 1326, 1336 (N.D. Ga. 2018) (granting TRO against 15-year old mail-in-\nballot law), appeal dismissed sub nom., Martin v. Sec’y of State of Georgia, No. 18-14503-GG, \n2018 WL 7139247 (11th Cir. Dec. 11, 2018).  \nIII.  Plaintiffs’ amended preliminary requested relief is proper and reasonable.   \n \nIn response to the Court’s January 24 Order and in consideration of Defendants’ Response, \nPlaintiffs filed an Amended Proposed Order Granting Preliminary Injunction on January 27, 2020. \nIn addition, at approximately 5:00 p.m. on January 27, Counsel for Plaintiffs described their \nupdated requested remedy in a phone call with Counsel for Defendants, in hopes of gaining the \nState’s consent prior to the hearing.    \nPlaintiffs’ Amended Proposed Order seeks two main forms of relief. First, it requires \nDefendant DPS to send information relevant to voter registration from each Individual Plaintiff’s \nlast online driver’s license transaction to Defendant SOS and requires that Defendant SOS ensure \neach Individual Plaintiff is registered to vote by 6:00 p.m. on Friday, January 31, 2020. Second, \nbeginning no later than 60 days from the date of the Order, it requires Defendant DPS to promptly \nmail a pre-populated voter registration application to every applicant who checks “yes” in response \nto the voter registration application question currently posed by Defendant DPS during an online \ndriver’s license transaction, with postage prepaid to return the application directly to Defendant \nSOS. \n9 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 44   Filed 01/28/20   Page 10 of 13\n \n \n  Plaintiffs’ Amended Proposed Order meets all the requirements of Rule 65(1). Pursuant to \nsubsection (1)(A), Plaintiffs explain that the order must be issued due to Defendants’ committed \nrefusal to comply with the NVRA and U.S. Constitution. Pursuant to subsection (1)(B), Plaintiffs \nlay out the specific and narrow terms for relief while this matter is pending. And pursuant to \nsubsection (1)(C), Plaintiffs describe in detail, without referring to the Complaint in this matter or \nany other document, actions each Defendant must take to comply with the order.7 \nIV.  Defendants’ harm is de minimus.  \nAs an initial matter, Defendants do not even identify a harm as to the requested individual \nrelief of registering three voters by the end of Friday. As to the other interim relief described above, \nPlaintiffs do not, at this stage, seek “sweeping technological and procedural changes” before the \nMarch election. Resp. at 14. No changes to the DPS website or SOS’s statewide voter registration \nprocesses are required at this time. Indeed, DPS already sends out voter registration applications \nby  mail  with  its  driver’s  license  renewal  notifications,  Excerpts  of  Mar.  7,  2017  30(b)(6) \nDeposition of Sheri Gipson at 49:18-24 (attached hereto as Ex. 6), 50:17-51:21 (attached hereto as \n \n7 In light of Plaintiffs’ Amended Proposed Order, the arguments Defendants raise in their Response \nas to feasibility and scope are moot. The others are not persuasive. To start, Defendants claim that \nthe phrase “voter registration applications in elections for Federal office” is nonsensical because \n“voter registration applications are not tied to particular elections.” Resp. at 21. However, the \nNVRA itself states that each State motor vehicle driver’s license application “. . . shall serve as an \napplication for voter registration with respect to elections for Federal office . . .” Plaintiffs included \nsuch language in order to confine the scope of the Amended Proposed Order to the mandates of \nthe NVRA, pursuant to Rule 65(1). In addition, Defendants contend that neither Defendant “has \nthe ability to register any voter at all.” Resp. at 21. But Plaintiffs’ Amended Proposed Order only \nrequires Defendant DPS to But Plaintiffs’ Amended Proposed Order only requires Defendant DPS \nto track and record information relevant to voter registration for each Individual Plaintiff, send \nsaid information  to Defendant SOS, and requires Defendant SOS, thereafter, to ensure each \nIndividual Plaintiff is registered to vote. Section 8 of the NVRA specifically requires Defendant \nSOS, as the chief election officer of the State, ensure voter registration for online driver’s license \napplicants who wish to register to vote. 52 U.S.C § 20507(a)(1)(A); Tex. Elec. Code § 31.001(a). \n \n10 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 44   Filed 01/28/20   Page 11 of 13\n \n \nEx. 11); 1/17/20 App’x at 51-53, and SOS already receives, sorts, and mails these same paper voter \nregistration applications to counties. Additional Excerpt of Mar. 22, 2017 Deposition of Keith at \n132:5-11 (attached hereto as Ex. 8). \n  This is a far cry from “last-minute sweeping changes to the State’s voter registration system \non the eve of an election.” Resp. at 15. Instead, Plaintiffs are asking DPS to take information it \nalready gathers—driver’s license applicants’ information submitted to DPS online—and print it \non a form that it already sends to DPS applicants in the mail. The DPS applicants would then be \nable to mail it to SOS, which already collects and sends these same voter registration forms to \ncounties to ensure that DPS applicants are registered. There is no reason that doing the same for \nthe additional DPS applicants who select “Yes” in response to the voter registration question \nduring an online transaction with DPS would, as Defendants suggest, result in uncertainty among \nvoters or county registrars. Further, any incremental burden on the Defendants in doing for online \nDPS applicants what they already do for other DPS applicants—with the additional step on DPS’s \npart of pre-populating the form with information submitted to it by eligible applicants—is certainly \noutweighed  by  the  Individual  Plaintiffs’  affected  LWVTX  members’  threatened \ndisenfranchisement and the Organizational Plaintiffs’ hampered voter registration, education, and \nmobilization efforts, as well as their diversion of resources in this critical time. See, e.g., Fish v. \nKobach, 189 F. Supp. 3d 1107, 1149-1150 (D. Kan. 2016).8   \n \n8 Defendants do not dispute Plaintiffs’ argument that protecting “franchise-related rights is without \nquestion in the public interest.” Charles H. Wesley Educ. Foundation, Inc., 408 F.3d at 1355. \nInstead, Defendants claim that “[w]hen a statute is enjoined, the State necessarily suffers the \nirreparable harm of denying the public interest in the enforcement of its laws.” Resp. 16-17 (citing \nby citing Planned Parenthood of Greater Texas Surgical Health Services v. Abbott, 734 F.3d 406, \n419 and Maryland v. King, 133 S. Ct. 1, 3 (2012)). However, the cases Defendants cite are \ninapposite to this case. In both Planned Parenthood of Greater Texas Surgical Health Services \nand Maryland, the courts indicate that the party moving for a preliminary injunction was unlikely \nto succeed on the merits.

      "text": "Case 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 60   Filed 03/16/20   Page 1 of 26\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS \nSAN ANTONIO DIVISION \n \n \n    § \nJARROD STRINGER, et al.,    § \nPlaintiffs,    § \n    § \nv.    §  No. SA-20-CV-46-OG \n    §     \nRUTH R. HUGHS, et al.,        § \nDefendants.         §   \n \nDEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO DISMISS \n \n  Pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6), Defendants \nrespectfully request that the Court dismiss the complaint filed by Jarrod Stringer, \nNayeli Gomez, John Harms, MOVE Texas Civic Fund (“MOVE Texas”), and League \nof Women Voters of Texas (“LWVTX”), Dkt. 1 (“Compl.”). \nBACKGROUND \nThe Court is well familiar with the long procedural and factual history of this \nmatter, and Defendants need not recount it in its entirety. See, e.g., Dkts. 36, 56; see \nalso Stringer v. Whitley (“Stringer I”), 942 F.3d 715 (5th Cir. 2019).  \nPlaintiffs allege that Defendants violate the National Voter Registration Act \n(“NVRA”), 52 U.S.C. §§ 20501-11, and the US Constitution based on the handling of \ndriver license renewals and changes of address that occur on the Department of \nPublic Safety (“DPS”) website. Defendants have established a process for individuals \nto register to vote during these transactions in compliance with State law, and \nDefendants  maintain—and  have  always  maintained—that  such  process  is  fully \n1 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 60   Filed 03/16/20   Page 2 of 26\ncompliant with both the NVRA and the Fourteenth Amendment. But for Plaintiffs, \nthe current process is insufficient because it does not satisfy their true aim: the \nimposition of online voter registration in Texas. The Texas Legislature has thus far \ndeclined to provide for online voter registration in the State, and neither the NVRA \nnor the US Constitution requires Texas to provide for online voter registration. The \nCourt should reject Plaintiffs’ attempt to achieve their preferred policy via litigation \nand dismiss this case. \nARGUMENT AND AUTHORITY \n  Plaintiffs’ complaint should be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction because they \nhave each failed to allege sufficiently that they have standing to proceed. And even if \nthey  had  standing,  Plaintiffs’  claims  fail  on  the  merits  because  Texas  law  and \nDefendants’ processes are compliant with the NVRA and the US Constitution.  \nI.  The Court lacks jurisdiction over Plaintiffs’ claims. \n \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) governs motions to dismiss for lack of \nsubject-matter jurisdiction. E.g., Hooks v. Landmark Indus., Inc., 797 F.3d 309, 312 \n(5th  Cir.  2015).  “Subject-matter  jurisdiction”  refers  to  “the  courts’  statutory  or \nconstitutional power to adjudicate the case.” Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env’t, \n523 U.S. 83, 89 (1998). Subject-matter jurisdiction is “a threshold issue that must be \nresolved before any federal court reaches the merits of the case before it.” Perez v. \nUnited States, 312 F.3d 191, 194 (5th Cir. 2002); Steel Co., 523 U.S. at 94-95.  \n“[S]tanding is perhaps the most important of the jurisdictional doctrines.” \nFW/PBS, Inc. v. City of Dallas, 493 U.S. 215, 231 (1990) (internal quotation omitted). \n2 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 60   Filed 03/16/20   Page 3 of 26\nTo establish Article III standing, a plaintiff must show: (1) an actual or imminent, \nconcrete  and  particularized  “injury-in-fact”;  (2)  that  is  fairly  traceable  to  the \nchallenged action of the defendant (causation); and (3) that is likely to be redressed \nby a favorable decision (redressability). Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Envt’l. \nServs.  (TOC),  Inc.,  528  U.S.  167,  180-81  (2000).  All  three  elements  are  “an \nindispensable part of the plaintiff’s case” and each plaintiff bears the burden to \nestablish them. E.g., Lujan v. Defs. of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 561 (1992). \nA. The Individual Plaintiffs lack standing. \n \nThe Fifth Circuit in Stringer I was clear about the burden the Individual \nPlaintiffs must satisfy in order to meet the three-element test for standing: \nRequests for injunctive and declaratory relief implicate the intersection \nof the redressability and injury-in-fact requirements. The redressability \nrequirement limits the relief that a plaintiff may seek to that which is \nlikely to remedy the plaintiff’s alleged injuries. Because injunctive and \ndeclaratory  relief  “cannot  conceivably  remedy  any  past \nwrong,” plaintiffs seeking injunctive and declaratory relief can satisfy \nthe  redressability  requirement  only  by  demonstrating  a  continuing \ninjury or threatened future injury. That continuing or threatened future \ninjury, like all injuries supporting Article III standing, must be an injury \nin fact. To be an injury in fact, a threatened future injury must be (1) \npotentially suffered by the plaintiff, not someone else; (2) “concrete and \nparticularized,” not  abstract; and  (3)  “actual  or  imminent,  not \n‘conjectural’ or ‘hypothetical.’” The purpose of the requirement that the \ninjury be “imminent” is “to ensure that the alleged injury is not too \nspeculative for Article III purposes.” For a threatened future injury to \nsatisfy the imminence requirement, there must be at least a “substantial \nrisk” that the injury will occur. \n \n942 F.3d at 720-21 (footnotes omitted). \nBut  notwithstanding  this  clear  instruction  from  the  Fifth  Circuit,  the \nIndividual Plaintiffs have failed to allege facts sufficient to demonstrate that they \n3 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 60   Filed 03/16/20   Page 4 of 26\nhave  suffered  a  redressable  injury-in-fact.  Moreover,  Plaintiffs  also  cannot \ndemonstrate that their injuries are traceable to Defendants. \n1.  Jarrod Stringer \n \n  Stringer—who  failed  to  demonstrate  standing  in  his  earlier  lawsuit—has \nagain failed to demonstrate that this Court has jurisdiction over his claims. He \nalleges two past harms: his failure to update his voter registration address prior to \nStringer I after he moved from Arlington to San Antonio, and his alleged failure to \nupdate his voter registration address again in November 2019 after he moved from \nSan Antonio to Houston. Compl. ¶¶ 49-50. Each of these is “not a continuing or \nthreatened future injury, but a past injury.” Stringer I, 942 F.3d at 721; see also, e.g., \nMcGregor v. LSU Bd. of Sup’rs, 3 F.3d 850, 867 (5th Cir. 1993) (“We must be careful \nnot to confuse continuous violations with a single violation followed by continuing \nconsequences; only continuous unlawful acts can form the basis of a continuous \nviolation.”). Accordingly, these alleged past harms cannot form the basis for standing \nto obtain prospective injunctive relief. \n  Stringer’s standing, then, must come from an alleged “substantial risk” that \nthe injury will recur. See Stringer I, 942 F.3d at 721 (“Standing also does not follow \nfrom the conclusion that the injunctive relief sought by a plaintiff would prevent the \nplaintiff from suffering the same injury in the future, which is always true when a \nplaintiff seeks an injunction prohibiting a defendant from repeating an action that \ninjured  the  plaintiff  in  the  past.”).  Perhaps  aware  of  this  problem,  Stringer’s \ncomplaint adds the following allegations: \n4 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 60   Filed 03/16/20   Page 5 of 26\nMr. Stringer plans to move residences again in 2020. Specifically, Mr. \nStringer and his wife plan to move out of their rental apartment into a \nnew residence by August 25, 2020 at the latest. When he moves to his \nnew address, Mr. Stringer intends to use the online DPS system to \nupdate his driver’s license address. \n \nCompl. ¶ 50. But this is not sufficient to constitute a “substantial risk.” As an initial \nmatter, “standing is not created by a declaration in court pleadings.” Miss. State \nDemocratic Party v. Barbour, 529 F.3d 538, 545 (5th Cir. 2008). Stringer’s allegations \nregarding his “substantial risk” of reinjury amount to nothing more than his own ipse \ndixit, and without any supporting facts, cannot establish standing. \nMoreover, Stringer does not allege that he intends to move out of Harris \nCounty. A voter who moves within the same county—i.e., within the jurisdiction of \nthe same voter registrar—can update their address online through Texas.gov. See \nTex. Elec. Code § 15.021(d). If the voter fails to make this change within 30 days of \nan election, the voter can still vote “in the election precinct in which the voter is \nregistered if the voter resides in the county in which the voter is registered and, if \napplicable: (1)  resides in the political subdivision served by the authority ordering \nthe election if the political subdivision is other than the county;  or (2)  resides in the \nterritory covered by the election in a less-than-countywide election ordered by the \ngovernor  or  a  county  authority.”  Tex.  Elec.  Code  §  63.0011(b);  see  also  Did \nYou Change Something?, https://www.votetexas.gov/register-to-vote/did-you-change-\nsomething.html (last visited March 15, 2020). Accordingly, without the allegation \nthat Stringer intends to leave his life in Harris County behind and move to the \njurisdiction  of  another  voter  registrar—and  that  there  is  no  suggestion  that  he \n5 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 60   Filed 03/16/20   Page 6 of 26\nintends  to  do  so—Stringer  cannot  demonstrate  that  he  faces  any  future  harm \nwhatsoever, must less a “substantial risk” of future harm that is necessary for him to \ndemonstrate  Article  III  standing.  Accordingly,  Stringer  fails  to  satisfy  both  the \ninjury-in-fact and the redressability prongs of the standing test. \n   Stringer also fails to demonstrate that any alleged injury to his right to vote \nis traceable to any conduct by either Defendant. The cause of any failure to have his \nvoter registration reflect his current address—a failure which does not impact his \nright or ability to vote, as described above—was his own inaction, and not the action \nof Defendants. If Stringer’s address was not updated as a result of the alleged \nNovember 23, 2019 online driver license transaction, it was because he failed to follow \nthe plain instructions on the website upon completion of his driver license update: \nsubmit a signed application to update their voter registration information. See, e.g., \nStringer I, 942 F.3d at 719. Accordingly, Stringer has failed to meet any of the three \nelements of the standing inquiry. \n2.  Nayeli Gomez \n \n  Gomez fails to demonstrate that she has standing for substantially the same \nreasons that Stringer fails to do so. Her alleged injury, if any, is a past injury, and \nthere is no suggestion that she will be injured again in the future; like the plaintiffs \nin Stringer I, she only alleges that she plans to interact with DPS online again in the \nfuture, see Compl. ¶ 51 (“Next time she changes addresses or needs to renew her \ndriver’s license and is eligible, Ms. Gomez intends to do so through the DPS online \nsystem.”), which does not constitute “a substantial risk that [she] will attempt to \n6 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 60   Filed 03/16/20   Page 7 of 26\nupdate [her] voter registration[] using the DPS System and be injured by [her] \ninability to do so.” Stringer I, 942 F.3d at 723. Gomez therefore fails to allege facts \nsufficient to demonstrate either an injury in fact or redressability. \nMoreover, Gomez has suffered no injury because she alleges only that she \nmoved within Bexar County. See Compl. ¶ 51. Thus, like Stringer, Gomez is both \neligible to change her voter registration address online and eligible to vote in her \nformer  precinct.  See  Tex.  Elec.  Code  §§  15.021(d),  63.0011(b);  see  also  Did \nYou Change Something?, https://www.votetexas.gov/register-to-vote/did-you-change-\nsomething.html (last visited March 15, 2020). Gomez’s right and ability to vote is \nsimply unaffected by Defendants’ conduct. \nFinally, Gomez’s alleged injury, if any, is not traceable to Defendants; she \nchose not to register when given the opportunity to do so using the process provided \nduring her online driver license transaction. The website was clear about what she \nneeded to do to register, and she simply failed to do it. Accordingly, and for the same \nreasons as Stringer, Gomez fails to satisfy each of the three elements of the standing \ntest. \n3.  John Harms \n \n  Harms fails to demonstrate standing for similar reasons. Like Gomez and the \nStringer I plaintiffs, Harms only alleges that he plans to interact with DPS online \nagain in the future, see Compl. ¶ 51 (“Next time he changes addresses or needs to \nrenew her [sic] driver’s license and is eligible, Mr. Harms intends to do so through \nthe DPS online system.”), which does not constitute “a substantial risk that [he] will \n7 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 60   Filed 03/16/20   Page 8 of 26\nattempt to update [his] voter registration[] using the DPS System and be injured by \n[his] inability to do so.” Stringer I, 942 F.3d at 723. Harms has therefore failed to \ndemonstrate a redressable injury in fact. Likewise, Harms has failed to demonstrate \nthat any alleged injury is traceable to Defendants, as explained above. Accordingly, \nHarms has also failed to establish any of the three elements of standing. \nB. The Organizational Plaintiffs lack standing. \n \nMOVE  Texas  and  LWVTX  (collectively,  “Organizational  Plaintiffs”)  lack \nArticle III standing to sue in their own right because they have not pleaded an injury \nin fact, and lack standing to sue on behalf of their members because they have not \nalleged individuals among their membership who are subject to an injury in fact, or \nthat such individuals’ participation is not required to maintain this case. And even if \nthey had Article III standing, their claims in Count III should still be dismissed \nbecause they lack statutory standing. \n1.  Organizational Standing \n \nAn  organization  has  standing  to  sue  if  it  satisfies  the  same  Article  III \nrequirements of injury in fact, causation, and redressability applicable to individuals. \nNAACP v. City of Kyle, Texas, 626 F.3d 233, 237 (5th Cir. 2010) (citing Lujan, 504 \nU.S. at 560-61). “[A]n organization may establish injury in fact by showing that it had \ndiverted  significant  resources  to  counteract  the  defendant’s  conduct;  hence,  the \ndefendant’s conduct significantly and ‘perceptibly impaired’ the organization’s ability \nto” conduct its routine “‘activities—with the consequent drain on the organization’s \nresources[.]’” Id. (quoting Havens Realty Corp. v. Coleman, 455 U.S. 363, 379 (1982)). \n8 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 60   Filed 03/16/20   Page 9 of 26\n“Not every diversion of resources to counteract [a] defendant’s conduct, however, \nestablishes an injury in fact.” Id. at 238. Rather, any “[s]uch injury must be ‘concrete \nand demonstrable.’” Id.  \nThus, to establish standing, “an organizational plaintiff must explain how the \nactivities it undertakes in response to the defendant’s conduct differ from its ‘routine \n[] activities,’” and must “identify ‘specific projects that [it] had to put on hold or \notherwise curtail in order to respond to’ the defendant’s conduct.” Def. Distributed v. \nU.S. Dep’t of State, No. 1:15-CV-372-RP, 2018 WL 3614221, at *4 (W.D. Tex. July 27, \n2018) (quoting City of Kyle, 626 F.3d at 238); see also, e.g., ACORN v. Fowler, 178 \nF.3d 350, 358 (5th Cir. 1999) (holding that organization’s expenditures must be \n“caused by an[] action by” the defendant that the organization “claims is illegal, as \nopposed to part of the normal, day-to-day operations of the group” to confer standing) \n(citing Fair Hous. Council of Suburban Philadelphia v. Montgomery Newspapers, 141 \nF.3d 71, 78 & n.5 (3d Cir. 1998)).1 \nThe Organizational Plaintiffs do not meet this standard. MOVE Texas alleges \nthat  \n•  it “is a grassroots nonpartisan, nonprofit organization building power in \nunderrepresented  youth  communities  through  civic  education, \nleadership development, and issue advocacy,” Compl. ¶¶ 21, 58; \n \n•  it “conducts voter registration in multiple counties in Texas, including \non college campuses, where MOVE Texas employees and volunteers \noffer  college  students  and  other  would-be  voters  the  opportunity  to \n                                            \n1 See also, e.g., Advocacy Ctr. v.

See Compl. ¶¶ 54-57. \nEven  if  these  allegations  were  true,  they  do  not  demonstrate  that  any \nOrganizational  Plaintiff  “diverted  significant  resources  to  counteract  the \ndefendant’s  conduct”  such  that  any  “defendant’s  conduct  significantly  and \n‘perceptibly impaired’ the organization’s ability to” conduct its routine “‘activities—\nwith the consequent drain on the organization’s resources[.]’” City of Kyle, 626 F.3d \nat 237 (quoting Havens, 455 U.S. at 379) (emphasis added). As explained in City of \nKyle, “[n]ot every diversion of resources to counteract [a] defendant’s conduct [] \nestablishes an injury in fact.” City of Kyle, 626 F.3d at 238 (quoting Havens, 455 U.S. \nat 379). Rather, any “[s]uch injury must be ‘concrete and demonstrable.’” Id.  \nThe  Organizational  Plaintiffs  fail  to  meet  this  standard.  Instead,  voter \nregistration, education, and outreach are already central to these organizations’ \n11 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 60   Filed 03/16/20   Page 12 of 26\n“routine activities.” Id.; Compl. ¶¶ 21, 22, 58, 61. Engaging in GOTV and voter \neducation efforts in Texas in which they would participate regardless of Defendants’ \nallegedly unlawful conduct does not amount to “concrete and demonstrable” injury to \nMOVE Texas or LWVTX. Havens, 455 U.S. at 379; City of Kyle, 626 F.3d at 238. And \nboth MOVE Texas and LWVTX fail to “identify ‘specific projects that [it] had to put \non hold or otherwise curtail in order to respond to’ the defendant’s conduct.” Def. \nDistributed, 2018 WL 3614221, at *4 (quoting City of Kyle, 626 F.3d at 238). Although \neach  generically  states  that  it  would  pursue  other  activities  absent  the  alleged \nconduct, those other activities are of the very same kind and character that each \nOrganizational Plaintiff routinely engages in. See Compl. ¶¶ 60, 63. Put differently, \nneither Organizational Plaintiff claims that voter outreach efforts fall outside the \n“normal, day-to-day operations of the group.” Cf. ACORN v. Fowler, 178 F.3d at 358. \nThus,  neither  of  the  Organizational  Plaintiffs  has  alleged  an  injury-in-fact  as \nrequired to show standing. \nIndeed, the “injury-in-fact” element of standing “serves to distinguish a person \nwith a direct stake in the outcome of a litigation—even though small—from a person \nwith  a  mere  interest  in  the  problem.”  United  States  v.  Students  Challenging \nRegulatory  Agency  Procedures,  412  U.S.  669,  689  n.14  (1973).  Because  the \nOrganizational Plaintiffs have at most alleged that they are interested in what they \nview as “the problem” in Stringer I, this Court should dismiss them from this case for \nfailure to allege injury-in-fact in their own right.2 \n                                            \n2 Moreover, as with the Individual Plaintiffs, the Organizational Plaintiffs fail to demonstrate \ntraceability because the alleged harm here—“frustration” of their “missions” and “thwarting” of their \n12 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 60   Filed 03/16/20   Page 13 of 26\n2.  Associational Standing \n \nUnder the doctrine of associational standing, an association may have standing \nto bring suit on behalf of its members when: “[1] its members would otherwise have \nstanding to sue in their own right; [2] the interests it seeks to protect are germane to \nthe organization’s purpose; and [3] neither the claim asserted nor the relief requested \nrequires the participation of individual members in the lawsuit.” Nat’l Rifle Ass’n of \nAm., Inc. v. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, & Explosives, 700 F.3d 185, 191 \n(5th Cir. 2012) (quoting Ass’n of Am. Physicians & Surgeons, Inc. v. Tex. Med. Bd., \n627 F.3d 547, 550 (5th Cir.2010)) (citation omitted). The Organizational Plaintiffs do \nnot allege facts to establish any of these factors. \nAs to the first prong, a plaintiff cannot have associational standing unless one \nof its members would have standing to sue individually. See Hunt v. Wash. State \nApple Advert. Comm’n, 432 U.S. 333, 343 (1977); Ctr. for Biological Diversity v. EPA, \n937 F.3d 533, 536 (5th Cir. 2019). Thus, each Organizational Plaintiff must “identify \nmembers who have suffered the requisite harm” for injury-in-fact. Summers v. Earth \nIsland Inst., 555 U.S. 488, 499 (2009); United Food & Comm. Workers Union Loc. 751 \nv. Brown Grp., Inc., 517 U.S. 544, 555 (1996) (An “association ‘can establish standing \nonly as representatives of those of their members who have been injured in fact, and \nthus could have brought suit in their own right.’”) (quoting Simon v. E. Ky. Welfare \nRights Org., 426 U.S. 26, 40 (1976)). \n                                            \n“efforts”—is not the result of Defendants’ conduct, but rather a result of voters’ failure to follow the \nprocess and instructions presented to them as they transact online regarding their driver license. \n13 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 60   Filed 03/16/20   Page 14 of 26\nThe Organizational Plaintiffs do not allege the existence of specific members—\nlet alone specific members who would have standing in their own right. MOVE Texas \ndoes  not  allege  that  it  has  members  at  all,  which  is  fatal  to  any  assertion  of \nassociational standing. See Compl. ¶¶ 21, 58-60; see also Hunt, 432 U.S. at 344 \n(requiring “indicia of membership in an organization” for associational standing); City \nof Olmsted Falls v. FAA, 292 F.3d 261, 267-68 (D.C. Cir. 2002). \n For LWVTX, the failure to identify any member with specificity is equally fatal \nto an assertion of associational standing. See, e.g., Summers v. Earth Island Inst., 555 \nU.S. at 498 (requiring “specific allegations establishing that at least one identified \nmember had suffered or would suffer harm” if all members would not be harmed) \n(emphasis added); City of Kyle, 626 F.3d at 237 (requiring evidence of “a specific \nmember”); Ga. Republican Party v. SEC, 888 F.3d 1198, 1203 (11th Cir. 2018); Draper \nv. Healey, 827 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 2016) (dismissing under Rule 12(b)(1) because \nplaintiff did not identify a member affected by the challenged regulation); Fund \nDemocracy, LLC v. S.E.C., 278 F.3d 21, 26 (D.C. Cir. 2006). \nAnd even if the Organizational Plaintiffs had alleged any specific member, they \nhave not pleaded “a continuing or threatened future injury” as required to establish \nstanding here. Cf. Stringer I, 942 F.3d at 721. As the Fifth Circuit explained in \nStringer I, to establish standing, a plaintiff “must demonstrate a sufficient probability \nthat [they] will use” the challenged “driver’s license services again.” Id. at 722. Where \n“Plaintiffs do not point to any Plaintiff-specific evidence suggesting that they will \nbecome unregistered and eligible to renew their driver’s licenses using the DPS \n14 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 60   Filed 03/16/20   Page 15 of 26\nSystem,” they “have not established a substantial risk that they will attempt to \nupdate their voter registrations using the DPS System and be injured by their \ninability to do so.” Id. at 723. “As a result,” such “Plaintiffs have not established an \ninjury in fact sufficient to confer standing to pursue the declaratory and injunctive \nrelief that they seek.” Id. \nTo be sure, Stringer I was an appeal from cross-motions for summary judgment \nafter the development of an evidentiary record. But even at the pleading stage, a \nlitigant must at least allege facts which would demonstrate standing if true. See, e.g., \nLujan, 504 U.S. at 561. And here, MOVE Texas does not allege that it has members \nat all, and LWVTX merely alleges having members who have interacted online with \nDPS. Thus, even if all their factual allegations were proven, the Organizational \nPlaintiffs still could not “establish[] a substantial risk that” any member “will attempt \nto update their voter registrations using the DPS System and be injured by their \ninability to do so.” Id. at 723. \nAs to the second prong, Defendants do not concede that either Organizational \nPlaintiff has satisfied or can satisfy the second element of associational standing, and \nreserve all rights to seek dismissal on that basis. Finally, as to the third prong, the \nOrganizational Plaintiffs also fail because the participation of individual members is \nrequired to obtain the relief they request. It is not enough to allege the existence of \nmembers eligible to transact with DPS online. They still must bring a claim that is \n“not particular to any individual” and “thus properly resolved in a group context.” \nGulf Restoration Network, Inc. v. Salazar, 683 F.3d 158, 168 (5th Cir. 2012). They \n15 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 60   Filed 03/16/20   Page 16 of 26\ncannot do so where, as here, individual voter registrations are at the heart of their \nchallenge. Cf., e.g., Church of Scientology v. Cazares, 638 F.2d 1272, 1276-80 (5th Cir. \n1981) (individual participation not required where “the claim asserted and the relief \nrequested affect the membership as a whole”); Familias Unidas v. Briscoe, 619 F.2d \n391, 398 n. 2 (5th Cir. 1980) (“[T]he declaratory relief sought, inuring as it would to \nthe benefit of all members, is ideally suited to allowing ‘associational standing.’”) \n(citation  omitted).  Accordingly,  the  Organizational  Plaintiffs  cannot  establish \nassociational standing. \n3.  Statutory Standing \n \nEven if the Organizational Plaintiffs had Article III standing, they would still \nlack statutory standing to bring their claim for a constitutional violation under Count \nIII of their complaint. See Lexmark Int’l, Inc. v. Static Control Components, Inc., 572 \nU.S. 118, 128 n.4 (2014) (explaining statutory standing). Section 1983 provides a \ncause  of  action  only  when  the  plaintiff  suffers  “the  deprivation  of  any  rights, \nprivileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws.” 42 U.S.C. § 1983. It \ndoes not provide a cause of action to plaintiffs claiming an injury based on the \nviolation of a third party’s rights. See Coon v. Ledbetter, 780 F.2d 1158, 1160 (5th Cir. \n1986) (“[L]ike all persons who claim a deprivation of constitutional rights, [plaintiffs] \nwere required to prove some violation of their personal rights.”); David P. Currie, \nMisunderstanding Standing, 1981 Sup. Ct. Rev. 41, 45. \nThus, § 1983 follows the general rule that a plaintiff “must assert [her] own \nlegal rights and interests, and cannot rest [her] claim to relief on the legal rights or \n16 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 60   Filed 03/16/20   Page 17 of 26\ninterests of third parties.” Danos v. Jones, 652 F.3d 577, 582 (5th Cir. 2011) (quoting \nWarth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 499 (1975)) (alterations original). When “[t]he alleged \nrights at issue” belong to a third party, rather than the plaintiff, the plaintiff lacks \nstatutory standing, regardless of Article III standing. Id.; see also Conn v. Gabbert, \n526 U.S. 286, 292-93 (1999) (lawyer “clearly had no standing” to bring § 1983 claim \nfor injury suffered as a result of “the alleged infringement of the rights of his client” \nbecause a plaintiff “generally must assert his own legal rights and interests, and \ncannot rest his claim to relief on the legal rights or interests of third parties.”) \nThe Organizational Plaintiffs do not have voting rights. See, e.g., Concerned \nHome Care Providers, Inc. v. Cuomo, 783 F.3d 77, 91 (2d Cir. 2015) (“Plaintiffs—five \ncorporations and a not-for-profit trade organization—are not entitled to vote and have \nno right to equal representation in the legislature.”); see also Vieth v. Pennsylvania, \n188 F. Supp. 2d 532, 546 (M.D. Pa. 2002) (“It goes without saying that political \nparties, although the principal players in the political process, do not have the right \nto vote.”). The Organizational Plaintiffs are necessarily asserting the rights of third \nparties, and lack statutory standing to sue under § 1983. \nII.  Plaintiffs  have  failed  to  state  a  claim  upon  which  relief  may  be \ngranted. \n \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) “authorizes a court to dismiss a claim \non the basis of a dispositive issue of law.” Neitzke v. William, 490 U.S. 319, 326 (1989) \n(citations omitted). “This procedure, operating on the assumption that the factual \nallegations  in  the  complaint  are  true,  streamlines  litigation  by  dispensing  with \nneedless discovery and factfinding.” Id. at 326-27. Thus, the issue under Rule 12(b)(6) \n17 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 60   Filed 03/16/20   Page 18 of 26\nis whether the Complaint alleges “enough facts to state a claim to relief that is \nplausible on its face,” assuming that the allegations are true. Bell Atlantic Corp. v. \nTwombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007). Notably, “[t]he tenet that a court must accept as \ntrue  all  of  the  allegations  contained  in  a  complaint  is  inapplicable  to  legal \nconclusions.” Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (citing Twombly, 550 U.S. at \n555).  \nPlaintiffs assert violations of the NVRA and the US Constitution. As set forth \nsupra, not one of the Plaintiffs has standing to pursue such claims in their own right \nor  as  an  association  representing  its  members.  But  even  if  standing  could  be \nestablished, such claims would fail on the merits. \nA.  Online driver license renewal procedures in Texas comply with \nthe NVRA (Count I). \n \nPlaintiffs claim that Texas violates the NVRA by not treating online driver’s \nlicense  renewals  or  changes  of  address  as  “simultaneous”  voter  registration \ntransactions. See Compl. ¶¶ 67-73. But this claim is defeated by the NVRA’s plain \nlanguage.  A  driver’s-license  renewal  must  permit  voter  registration  “unless  the \napplicant fails to sign the voter registration application.” 52 U.S.C. § 20504(a)(1) \n(emphasis added). And the NVRA expressly requires that “[t]he voter registration \napplication portion of an application for a State motor vehicle driver’s license,” which \nincludes any renewal request, “shall include a statement that . . . requires the \nsignature of the applicant, under penalty of perjury.” Id. § 20504(c)(2)(C)(iii). The \nState cannot obtain a written signature in an online transaction, and nothing in the \n18 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 60   Filed 03/16/20   Page 19 of 26\nstatutory text forbids the State to collect the necessary signature by providing for the \n“voter registration application portion” of the transaction on paper.  \nThe NVRA does not require that the State accept electronic signatures related \nto different documents (here, the driver’s-license application, which also required a \nseparate  written  signature)  in  lieu  of  a  signature  on  the  voter-registration \napplication. The plain language suggests just the opposite—the statute expressly \nrequires not only that the voter-registration application be signed, but that the voter-\nregistration portion of any driver’s-license application or renewal require a signature \nunder penalty of perjury. 52 U.S.C. § 20504(a)(1), (c)(2)(C)(iii). Nothing in the text \ncompels the States to accept electronic signatures, and given that the NVRA was \nenacted  in  1993,  before  the  ubiquity  of  the  Internet,  it  is  likely  that  Congress \nenvisioned what Texas requires—a writing. \nBecause Texas law complies with § 20504(a), there can be no violation of the \nduplicate-information requirement of § 20504(c) or the time-period requirements of \n§§ 20504(e) and 20507, because these requirements are simply not implicated by \nTexas’s process. Accordingly, as Texas law and Defendants’ procedures comply fully \nwith the NVRA, Count I should be dismissed. \nB.  Online  driver  license  change-of-address  transactions  in  Texas \ncomply with the NVRA (Count II). \n \nPlaintiffs also claim that Texas violates the NVRA by not allowing online voter \nregistration when an individual changes the address on his or her driver license with \nDPS online. See Compl. ¶¶ 74-79. But this claim too is not supported by the text of \nthe statute, which plainly permits—and in fact requires—a signature on the voter-\n19 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 60   Filed 03/16/20   Page 20 of 26\nregistration portion of a driver’s-license application or renewal form. See 52 U.S.C. \n§§ 20504(a)(2),  (c)(2)(C)(iii).  Given  that  the  NVRA  explicitly  requires  a  separate \nsignature  for  a  driver’s-license  application  to  function  as  a  voter-registration \napplication, there is no basis to infer that Congress intended a mere change-of-\naddress form to have the same effect with no signature at all.  \nThe  NVRA  was  adopted  in  1993,  when  the  use  of  the  Internet  for  such \ntransactions  was  likely  not  contemplated.  Subsection  (d)’s  requirement  that  an \nindividual be able to “state[] on the form” that the change of address is not for voter-\nregistration purposes presents difficulty when the form in question consists of specific \nfields on an Internet application. Id. § 20504(d). Moreover, subsection (d) does not \npurport to preempt any state law that would require a signature on change-of-address \nforms. Texas’s solution—providing a link to a written application that will comply \nwith state law after explaining that the applicant cannot register to vote online—is a \nreasonable  synthesis  of  state  and  federal  law  in  a  situation  not  previously \ncontemplated by Congress. \nAs with Count I, because Texas law complies with § 20504(d), there can be no \nviolation of the duplicate-information requirement of § 20504(c) or the time-period \nrequirements of §§ 20504(e) and 20507, as these requirements are not implicated by \nTexas’s process. Accordingly, because Texas law and Defendants’ procedures comply \nfully with the NVRA, Count II should be dismissed. \n \n \n20 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 60   Filed 03/16/20   Page 21 of 26\nC.  None of Defendants’ alleged conduct violates the U.S Constitution \n(Count III). \n \nNeither the Organizational Plaintiffs nor the Individual Plaintiffs are being \nsubjected a violation of their constitutional rights under the Fourteenth Amendment, \nbecause neither group of plaintiffs is subject to disparate or discriminatory treatment. \nDefendants address each set of plaintiffs in turn. \na.  The Organizational Plaintiffs \n \nTexas’s handling of online transactions with DPS does not violate the Equal \nProtection Clause with respect to the Organizational Plaintiffs. An equal protection \nclaim  involving  voting  rights  requires  allegation  of  “intentional  discrimination \nagainst an identifiable political group and an actual discriminatory effect on that \ngroup.” Republican Party of N.C. v. Martin, 980 F.2d 943, 955 (4th Cir. 1992) (citation \nomitted); see also, e.g., Veasey v. Abbott, 830 F.3d 216, 230 (5th Cir. 2016) (en banc) \n(stating that “[p]roof of racially discriminatory intent or purpose is required to show \na violation of the Equal Protection Clause” (quoting Village of Arlington Hts. v. Metro. \nHous. Dev. Corp., 429 U.S. 252, 265 (1977))). Plaintiffs have not plausibly alleged \nintentional or purposeful discrimination in which one class is favored over another. \nStatutes  providing  neutral  rules,  which might  benefit  any  group,  are  not \nrendered discriminatory by the fact that they benefit one group when applied in \nparticular circumstances.  See Rodriguez v. Popular Democratic Party, 457 U.S. 1, 10 \nn.10  (1982)  (holding  that  “a  statute  providing  that  all  such  vacancies  [in  the \nlegislature] be filled by appointment does not have a special impact on any discrete \ngroup of voters or candidates” and thus is not discriminatory for equal-protection \n21 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 60   Filed 03/16/20   Page 22 of 26\npurposes).  Here,  the  Organizational  Plaintiffs  do  not  even  allege  that  Texas’s \nhandling  of  online  driver  license  and  change  of  address  transactions \ndisproportionately impacts them. And they certainly do not allege that it is the result \nof “intentional discrimination” against any group. Cf. Republican Party of N.C. v. \nMartin, 980 F.2d at 955. \nThe Organizational Plaintiffs fail to state an equal protection claim. \nb.  Individual Voters \n \nEven if any of the Plaintiffs had standing to pursue claims on their own behalf \nor on behalf of any other individual voter—which they do not—Texas’s handling of \nonline driver license transactions does not violate any individual’s constitutional \nrights.  This  is  because  Texas’s  written-signature  requirement  for  new  voter-\nregistration applications and requests to update voter-registration information—\nwhich prevents online voter-registration transactions—applies equally to everyone \nand does not impose an unconstitutional burden on the right to vote. See TEX. ELEC. \nCODE §§ 13.002(b), 15.021(a); see also id. § 20.066(a)(1). \nIn evaluating an alleged burden on voting rights, the Anderson/Burdick test \nrequires courts to “first consider the character and magnitude of the asserted injury \nto the rights protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments that the plaintiff \nseeks to vindicate.” Voting for Am., Inc. v. Steen, 732 F.3d 382, 387 (5th Cir. 2013) \n(quoting Anderson, 460 U.S. at 789). Then, the Court “must identify and evaluate the \nprecise interest put forward by the State as justifications for the burden imposed by \nits rule.” Id. (quoting Anderson, 460 U.S. at 789). Finally, the Court weighs the \n22 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 60   Filed 03/16/20   Page 23 of 26\n“character and magnitude of the asserted in-jury” against the “precise interests put \nforward by the State,” taking into consideration “the extent to which those interests \nmake it necessary to burden the plaintiff’s rights.” Id. at 387-88 (quoting Burdick, \n504 U.S. at 434). When a state election law provision imposes only “reasonable, \nnondiscriminatory restrictions” upon the First and Fourteenth Amendment rights of \nvoters, “the state’s important regulatory interests are generally sufficient to justify” \nthe restrictions. Anderson, 460 U.S. at 788.  \nAs  to  the  “character  and  magnitude  of  the  asserted  injury  to  the  rights \nprotected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments” at issue, Plaintiffs assert that \nindividuals who choose to transact with DPS online are burdened because—unlike \nindividuals who choose to transact with DPS in person or by mail—online users \ncannot simply check a box to become registered to vote or change their registration \naddress. See generally Compl. Texans can register to vote in several ways: in person, \nby  mail,  or  by  fax.  TEX. ELEC. CODE §  13.002(a).  Texas  law  also  permits  voter \nregistration in conjunction with a driver’s license transaction (either in person or by \nmail). But because of Texas’s written signature requirement, id. § 13.002(b), Texas \nhas never permitted online voter registration. \nBeing treated like everyone else—making a written, signed request to register \nto vote or update voter-registration information—does not burden any individual’s \nright to equal protection. If an individual desires the simplicity of checking a single \nbox, they may register using a paper registration form. Stated differently, providing \nmultiple options for individuals to register to vote is not a violation of the Equal \n23 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 60   Filed 03/16/20   Page 24 of 26\nProtection Clause even if Plaintiffs consider some options to be less convenient than \nothers. \nThe interests of the State in requiring written signatures, which necessarily \nforecloses  online  registration,  include  maintaining  accurate  voting  rolls  and \ncombatting fraud. It cannot be debated that States have an interest in requiring a \nsignature from voters. See, e.g., 52 U.S.C. § 20504(c). And Texas can use written \nsignatures in cases of fraud, identity theft, and consideration of absentee ballots. See, \ne.g., Husted v. A. Philip Randolph Inst., 138 S. Ct. 1833, 1838 (2018) (“It has been \nestimated that 24 million voter registrations in the United States—about one in \neight—are either invalid or significantly inaccurate.”) (citation omitted). \nThe Fifth Circuit has also recognized that preventing voter-registration fraud \nis a permissible state interest that warrants some limits on voter registration. Voting \nfor Am., 732 F.3d at 394-95. It is not necessary for Defendants to produce specific \nevidence of fraud to justify preventative measures. Id. (citing Crawford v. Marion \nCty. Election Bd., 553 U.S. 181, 196 (2008) (plurality op.)).3 \nA State may act to prevent potential fraud, as “[a]ny corruption in voter \nregistration affects a state’s paramount obligation to ensure the integrity of the \n                                            \n3 See also Short v. Brown, 893 F.3d 671, 679 (9th Cir. 2018) (finding “general interest in increasing \nvoter turnout” sufficient to justify experimental use of mail-in ballots in specific counties); Tripp v. \nScholz, 872 F.3d 857, 866 (7th Cir. 2017) (finding “speculative concern” sufficient to justify ballot-\naccess limitation); Ohio Democratic Party v. Husted, 834 F.3d 620, 632 (6th Cir. 2016) (holding that \nwhen a regulation is “not unduly burdensome,” a State need not “prove” that evidence supports its \ninterest; the court may defer to legislature’s findings); cf. Husted, 138 S. Ct. at 1847 (cautioning that \ncompliance with the NVRA did not require the State to make “a wise policy judgment” or “have some \nparticular quantum of evidence of a change of residence” before taking steps to verify a voter’s address); \nMunro v. Socialist Workers Party, 479 U.S. 189, 195 (1986) (“Legislatures . . . should be permitted to \nrespond to potential deficiencies in the electoral process with foresight rather than reactively . . . .”). \n24 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 60   Filed 03/16/20   Page 25 of 26\nvoting process and threatens the public’s right to democratic government.” Voting for \nAm., 732 F.3d at 394. Balancing individual voter equal-protection rights against the \nState’s interests reveals no unconstitutional burden on the right to vote. The State \nhas provided several options to register to vote, all of which satisfy the State’s \nwritten-signature  requirement.  Whether  to  permit  online  registration  is  a \nquintessentially state-law function, absent a preemptive federal law requiring it. U.S. \nCONST. art. I, § 4, cl. 1. No such law exists. The Equal Protection Clause does not \nrequire what Plaintiffs demand, and no individual’s right to vote is unconstitutionally \nburdened by Texas’s written-signature requirement for voter registration. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n25 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 60   Filed 03/16/20   Page 26 of 26\nCONCLUSION & PRAYER \n  Plaintiffs’ claims should be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction and for failure to \nstate a claim on which relief may be granted. \nRespectfully submitted. \n \nKEN PAXTON \nAttorney General of Texas \n \nJEFFREY C.

P. 25(d). \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 28   Filed 01/21/20   Page 2 of 12\nto vote solely because they choose to utilize DPS's online portal for renewal and change of address \ntransactions rather than accomplishing these tasks in person or by mail. Texas voters will continue \nto be  shut out of the democratic process unless  and until Defendants reform their registration \npractices. \n2.  Defendants permit certain Texas driver's license holders to renew their license \nand/or update the address on their license online on DPS' website at www.txdps.state.tx.us. While \nthere have been many different iterations of this online process over the years, see Stringer v. \nFablos, 320 F. Supp. 3d 862, 869, 871, 876,  (W.D. Tex. 2018), none have offered any means for \nsimultaneous voter registration. Today, despite years of litigation over this issue before this Court, \nDefendants still fail to allow for simultaneous registration with online renewals and changes of \naddress. See Press Release, Ken Paxton, Attorney General of Texas, Fifth Circuit Rules in Favor \nof  Texas  Voter  Registration  System  in  \"Motor  Voter\"  Lawsuit  (Nov.  14,  2019), \nhttps://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/news/releases/fifth-circuit-rules-favor-texas-voter- \nregistration-system-motor-voter-lawsuit (\"Currently,  Texans  who  use  the  DPS  driver  license \nrenewal and change-of-address website are sent to a separate page  administered by the Texas \nSecretary of State  where they can complete an online application, print it out, sign it, and mail it \nto their county voter registrar to ensure their ability to vote in upcoming elections.\"). \n3.  In  contrast to the  multi-step process required for  a driver using DPS's online \nsystems to update their voter registration, DPS's in-person driver's license applications, ECF No. \n93, exh. A-7, in-person renewal/replacement/change of address forms, ECF No. 93, exh. A-8, and \nmail in change of address forms, ECF No. 93, ex. A-9, serve as simultaneous voter registration \napplications. \n2 \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 28   Filed 01/21/20   Page 3 of 12\n4.  Defendants' current practices treat similarly situated voters differently based solely \non how those voters choose to transact with DPS without any adequate justification, in violation \nof the U.S. Constitution's requirement of equal protection. \n5.  Defendants  must  not  be  permitted  to  continue  to  ignore  constitutional  Jaw. \nIntervenor-Plaintiffs respectfully request that this Court enjoin Defendants from further violations \nof the law and grant the relief set forth below. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n6.  Intervenor-Plaintiffs  sue  under  42  U.S.C.  §  1983  and  1988  to  redress  the \ndeprivation under color of state law of rights secured by the United States  Constitution. \n7.  This Court has original jurisdiction over the subject of this action under 28 U.S.C. \n1331 and 1343 because the matters in controversy arise under the Constitution and laws of the \n§ \nUnited States. \n8.  This Court has personal jurisdiction over Defendants, who are citizens of the State \nof Texas and sued in their official capacity  only. \n9.  Venue is proper in this Court under 28 U.S.C. §  139 1(b) because a substantial part \nof the events that caused Intervenor-Plaintiffs' claims occurred in this judicial  district, and each \nDefendant conducts business in this district. \n10.  This  Court  has  the authority to  enter a  declaratory judgment  and to  provide \ninjunctive relief under Rules 57 and 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and 28 U.S.C. \n2201 and 2202. \n§ \nPARTIES \n11.  Plaintiff the  Texas  Democratic Party  (\"TDP\")  is  the  statewide  organization \nrepresenting Democratic candidates and voters throughout the State of Texas within the meaning \n3 \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 28   Filed 01/21/20   Page 4 of 12\nof Section 117 of Texas's Election Code and all other applicable provisions of the election laws. \nTDP's purpose is to elect Democratic Party candidates to public office throughout Texas. To \naccomplish  its  purpose,  TDP  engages  in  vitally  important  activities,  including  supporting \nDemocratic  Party  candidates  in  national,  state,  and  local  elections  through  ftindraising  and \norganizing; protecting the legal rights of voters; and ensuring that all voters have a meaningful \nability to cast ballots in Texas. TDP has millions of members and constituents from across Texas, \nincluding millions of Texans who are registered with the Texas Department of State's Division of \nElections as Democrats, millions of Texans who are drivers who interact with DPS, and many \nother Texans who regularly support and vote for candidates affiliated with the Democratic Party. \n12.  Plaintiff DSCC is the national senatorial committee of the Democratic Party, as \ndefined by 52 U.S.C.  30101(14), and its mission is to elect candidates of the Democratic Party \n§ \nto the United States Senate, including in Texas. DSCC works to accomplish its mission across the \ncountry  and in  Texas by, among  other things,  assisting state parties  throughout the  country, \nincluding in Texas.  In 2018, DSCC made contributions and expenditures in the tens of millions \nof dollars to persuade and mobilize voters to support Democratic Senate candidates.  In 2020, \nDSCC expects to invest millions in support of the Democratic candidate selected as the nominee \nto  run  against Republican  Senator  John  Comyn. Texas's  conduct  directly harms DSCC  by \nfrustrating its mission of, and efforts in, electing the Democratic Party candidate to the U.S. Senate \nin Texas by suppressing the access of eligible Texas citizens to the franchise. DSCC is aware of \nTexas's online portal system and will have to expend and divert additional funds and resources on \nensuring that eligible citizens are not misled into believing that they have effectively registered to \nvote, and are in fact registered to vote, as well as to support GOTV, voter persuasion efforts, and \n4 \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 28   Filed 01/21/20   Page 5 of 12\nother activities in Texas, at the expense of its other efforts to defeat Senator Cornyn, as well as its \nefforts in other states, to combat the effects of Texas's conduct. \n13.  Plaintiff DCCC is the national congressional committee of the Democratic Party, \nas defined by 52 U.S.C.  30101(14). DCCC's mission is electing Democratic candidates to the \n§ \nU.S. House of Representatives from congressional districts across the United States, including \nfrom Texas's 36 congressional districts. DCCC works to accomplish its mission across the country \nand in Texas by, among other things, assisting state parties throughout the country, including in \nTexas in its efforts to elect Democrats to public office.  Tn 2018, DCCC made contributions and \nexpenditures  in  the tens  of millions  of dollars  to persuade  and  mobilize  voters  to  support \nDemocratic  congressional  candidatesseveral million  dollars of which were  spent for those \npurposes in Texas. For 2020, DCCC has identified at least eight congressional districts in Texas \n(Congressional Districts 7, 10, 21, 22, 23, 24, 31, and 32) as targeted races, in which it will expend \nresources to support the  Democratic candidate, including  specifically through expenditures on \nvoter registration efforts. Overall, in 2020, DCCC expects to make contributions and expenditures \nin the millions of dollars to persuade and mobilize voters to support Democratic candidates in \ncongressional  elections  around the country, including  in Texas.  Defendants' conduct  directly \nharms DCCC by forcing DCCC to spend additional money on voter registration instead of other \ncritical priorities. Defendants' conduct also frustrates DCCC mission of, and efforts in, electing \nDemocratic Party candidates to the U.S. Congress in Texas by suppressing the access of eligible \nTexas citizens to the franchise. DCCC is aware of Texas's unconstitutional online portal system \nand will have to expend and divert additional funds and resources on voter registration and on \nensuring that eligible citizens are not misled into believing that they have effectively registered to \nvote when they have not. Additional resources will need to be allocated to these efforts at the \n5 \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 28   Filed 01/21/20   Page 6 of 12\nexpense of DCCC's other efforts to elect Democrats to Congress from Texas, as well as its efforts \nin other states, in order to combat the effects of Defendants' conduct. \n14.  Defendant RUTH HUGHS is sued in her official capacity as the Secretary of State \nof Texas. The Secretary is a person within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and acts under color \nof state law in her official capacity. The Secretary's official responsibilities include serving as the \nChief Election Officer for Texas, assisting county election officials and ensuring the uniform \napplication and interpretation of election  laws throughout Texas. See Tex. Elec.  Code Ann.  § \n31.001(a).  As the head  of the Elections  Division of her office, the Secretary is  charged with \nadministering the Texas Election Code. \n15.  Defendant STEVEN C.  MCCRAW is the Director of DPS,  and is sued  in his \nofficial capacity. DPS is Texas' motor vehicle bureau. DPS operates offices around the state, issues \ndriver's licenses and other state identification cards, and is responsible under state and federal law \nfor providing voter registration services and transmitting voter registration information to the \nTexas Secretary of State. See 52 U.S.C. §  20503-20504; Tex. Elec. Code Ann. §  20.063, 20.066. \nSTATEMENT OF FACTS AND LAW \nA. The Fourteenth Amendment \n16.  The Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause is implicated any time a \nstate subjects voters to disparate treatment or places arbitrary restrictions upon the right to vote. \nU.S. Const. amend. XIV, § 1. \n17.  There is no \"litmus test for measuring the severity of a burden that a state law \nimposes on.  an individual voter, or a discrete class of voters. However slight that burden may \n.  . \nappear,  it must be justified by relevant and legitimate state interests 'sufficiently weighty to \n.  .  . \njustiIi the limitation.\" Crawford v. Marion Cly. ElectionBd., 553 U.S. 181, 191 (2008) (Stevens, \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 28   Filed 01/21/20   Page 7 of 12\nJ., announcing judgment of Court); accord ObamaforAm. v. Husted, 697 F.3d 423, 429 (6th Cir. \n2012)  (\"When a plaintiff alleges that a state has burdened  voting rights through the disparate \ntreatment of voters,  we review the claim using the flexible standard outlined  in Anderson v. \nCelebrezze  courts must weigh the burden on voters against the state's asserted justifications \n.  .  . \nand make the hard judgment that our adversary system demands.\" (quotation marks and citations \nomitted)). \nB. Texas Election Code \n18.  Texas state law specifies that DPS must use \"a form and procedure that combines \nthe department's  application  form  for  a  license  or  card  with  an  officially prescribed  voter \nregistration application form.\" Tex. Elec. Code Ann. § 20.062(a). \n19.  DPS must also provide a \"change of address form and procedure that combines \ndepartment and voter registration functions,\" id. § 20.062(b), so that when a voter submits a change \nof address, that \"serves as a change of address for voter registration\" as well, unless the individual \nindicates otherwise. Id.  20.063(c). \n§ \n20.  In addition, if a \"correct driver's license number or personal identification card \nnumber\" or  if \"correct residence address or mailing address\"  information  is  missing from  a \nregistration  application,  DPS  employees  have  a  duty  to  correct  the  voter's  application  by \n\"enter[ing] the information on the application.\" Id. § 20.063(d). \n21.  Finally,  voter  registration  applications  and  change-of-address  forms  must  be \npromptly delivered to election officials. Specifically, \"[n]ot later than the fifth day after the date a \nperson completes  a voter registration  application and provides  an electronic  signature to  the \ndepartment, [DPS] shall electronically transfer the applicant's voter registration data, including the \napplicant's signature, to the [Texas Secretary of State].\" Id.  § 20.066(b); see also id. § 20.065. \n7 \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 28   Filed 01/21/20   Page 8 of 12\nC. DPS  does  not provide  simultaneous  voter  registration  with  online transactions \ndespite doing so with mail and in-person transactions \n22.  DPS's in-person driver's license applications, ECF No.  93,  exh. A-7,  in-person \nrenewal/replacement/change  of address forms, ECF No.  93, exh. A-8,  and mail in change-of- \naddress forms, ECF No. 93, ex. A-9, serve as simultaneous voter registration applications. \n23.  DPS encourages Texans to use a number of online services through its website, \nwww.txdps.state.tx.us,  an official governmental website for the State of Texas. \n24.  DPS invites  many Texas driver's license holders to renew their license and/or \nupdate the address information associated with their license online through a portion of its website \nentitled \"Driver License Renewal, Replacement, Change of Address or Change of Emergency \nContacts,\" available at https ://txapps.texas.gov/tolapp/txdl/. \n25.  This website page provides a single online portal for qualified holders of a Texas \ndriver's license to renew their driver's licenses, update the address listed on their driver's licenses, \nor both. \n26.  The online process involves nine \"Steps to Complete,\" including the following \nsteps: Welcome, Login, Select Services, Enter Address, Select Options, Review Order, Submit \nPayment, Emergency Contacts, and Receipt. \n27.  Unlike Defendants' simultaneous voter registration services for license renewal or \naddress update applications submitted in-person at a DPS office or through the mail, Defendants \ndo not provide for simultaneous voter registration at any point during the online license renewal \nor  address  update  process.  Instead  of providing  any  simultaneous  opportunity  for  voter \nregistration, the DPS website directs voters to an entirely different website, where voters must \ncomplete an online application, print it out, sign it, and mail it to their county voter registrar to \nensure their ability to vote in upcoming elections. \n8 \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 28   Filed 01/21/20   Page 9 of 12\n28.  Even though Defendants refuse to use information from online change-of-address \ntransactions to properly register voters at their new addresses, they are certainly capable of using \nthis information to do so. In fact, Defendants may use the same online information to cancel a \nvoter's prior registration record even though they fail to give voters any notice of this possibility. \nSee Tex. Elec. Code Ann. § 16.03 1. \nD. Defendants' Voter Registration Failures Harm Countless Texas Voters \n29.  As  a result of Defendants'  failure to register eligible voters equally,  countless \neligible Texas residents have been denied the right to voter registration. \n30.  According  to  data  already  in  the  factual  record  before  this  Court,  between \nSeptember 2013  and February 2015, the Secretary's Elections Division confirmed over 1,700 \nincidents reported by voters who checked \"yes\" on their drivers'  license applications at DPS, \nindicating they wanted to register to vote at that time, but did not appear on the voter rolls. ECF \nNo. 1-4 at 7. \n31.  The voters who complained almost certainly represent just a fraction of the total \naffected during that time frame. Indeed, the State's records capture only those voters who contacted \nelection workers, specifically complained about registration problems at DPS, and had their files \ninvestigated  surely, not all affected voters complained; others may have reported problems but \nhad their complaints disregarded by election workers. Further, this data comes from just 123 of \nTexas' 254 counties, strongly suggesting that the data set itself is incomplete. See ECF No. 1-3; \nECF No. 1-4 at 9. \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 28   Filed 01/21/20   Page 10 of 12\nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nCOUNT I \nViolation of Fourteenth Amendment: Disparate Treatment \nU.S. Const. amend. XIV; 42 U.S.C. § 1983; 28 U.S.C. §  2201, 2202 \n32.  Intervenor-Plaintiffs  reallege  and  incorporate  by  reference  all  previous  and \nsubsequent paragraphs as though set forth herein. \n33.  By arbitrarily subjecting eligible voters to disparate voter registration standards, \nDefendants have denied voters an equal opportunity to participate in federal and state elections in \nviolation of Section  of the Fourteenth Amendment. As a result of this disparate treatment, \n1 \nIntervenor-Plaintiffs were directly harmed in their mission to elect Democratic representatives, \nand those among their membership harmed through disenfranchisement. \n34.  No legitimate state interest could justify the state's differential treatment, which \ncreates arbitrary distinctions among Texas voters based on how they choose to interact with DPS. \n35.  Absent relief, DSCC, DCCC, and TDP along with its members and constituents, \nwill be denied an equal opportunity to participate in Texas's elections. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Intervenor-Plaintiffs respectfully request this Court enter judgment: \n(a)  declaring,  under the authority  granted to this  Court by 28 U.S.C.  § 2201, that \nDefendants have violated Section  of the Fourteenth  Amendment by denying \n1 \nvoters an equal opportunity to participate in federal and state elections; \n(b)  permanently  enjoining Defendants, their respective agents, officers, employees, \nand successors, and all persons acting in concert with each or any of them, from \nimplementing practices  and procedures  that  likewise  violate  Section  1  of the \nFourteenth Amendment; \n(c)  directing Defendants, under a court-approved plan with appropriate reporting and \nmonitoring requirements, to take all appropriate measures necessary to remedy the \nharm  caused by their violation, including, but not  limited to providing  for the \nelectronic  transfer  of voter  registration  information  collected  through  online \ntransactions to the Secretary of State, similar to the existing system to transfer voter \nregistration information collected through in-person transactions; \n10 \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 28   Filed 01/21/20   Page 11 of 12\n(d)  awarding Intervenor-Plaintiffs their costs, disbursements, and reasonable attorneys' \nfees incurred in bringing this action under 42 U.S.C. § 1988 and other applicable \nlaws; \n(e)  retaining jurisdiction over this action to ensure that Defendants continue to comply \nwith their obligations under Section  of the Fourteenth Amendment; and \n1 \n(f)  granting such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper. \nDated: December 20, 2019.

CASCOS, IN HIS OFFICIAL    § \nCAPACITY AS THE TEXAS SECRETARY OF   § \nSTATE and STEVEN C. McCRAW, IN HIS  § \nOFFICIAL CAPACITY AS THE DIRECTOR OF  § \nTHE TEXAS DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC    § \nSAFETY            § \n              § \nDefendants.      § \n \nPLAINTIFFS’ ORIGINAL COMPLAINT \nNATURE OF THE ACTION \n1.  This action seeks declaratory and injunctive relief to redress Defendants’ systemic \nand ongoing violations of the “Motor Voter” provisions of the National Voter Registration Act of \n1993 (“NVRA”), enacted as Public Law 103-31 and codified at 52 U.S.C. §§ 20501-20511. \nDefendants’  conduct  also  violates  the  U.S.  Constitution’s  guarantee  of  equal  protection, \npreserved by Section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment. As a result, Plaintiffs, who are eligible \nTexas voters, have been disenfranchised — just like the thousands of similarly situated voters \nwho complained to election officials about these same problems when their ballots were not \ncounted. Texas voters will continue to be shut out of the democratic process unless and until \nDefendants reform their registration practices.  \n2.  After finding that “discriminatory and unfair registration laws and procedures can \nhave a direct and damaging effect on voter participation,” and that state governments have a \n“duty” to promote voting and voter registration, Congress enacted the NVRA to “establish \n1 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 1   Filed 03/14/16   Page 2 of 19\n \n \nprocedures that will increase the number of eligible citizens who register to vote in elections for \nFederal office.” 52 U.S.C. § 20501. Through its Motor Voter provisions, the NVRA imposes \nvoter registration obligations upon state motor vehicle bureaus. Specifically,  every time an \neligible voter obtains, renews, or updates his or her driver’s license with the Texas Department \nof Public Safety (“DPS”), the State must simultaneously offer to register that person to vote or to \nupdate the voter’s registration record.  \n3.  The Motor Voter provisions require DPS to simultaneously treat: (a) “each . . .  \ndriver’s license application (including any renewal application)” as an “application for voter \nregistration,” 52 U.S.C. § 20504(a)(1); and (d) “any change of address form” as a “notification of \nchange of address for voter registration,” 52 U.S.C. § 20504. Defendants have a legal duty to \nensure that every eligible voter who submits a driver’s license application or renewal, or updates \nhis or her address with DPS, is duly registered to vote. 52 U.S.C. § 20507(a)(1)(A).  \n4.  The  Motor  Voter  provisions  apply  to  “each”  renewal  application  and  “any” \nchange-of-address form submitted to DPS, unless the voter “fails to sign the voter registration \napplication” or “states on the form that the change of address is not for voter registration \npurposes.” 52 U.S.C. § 20504. Accordingly, outside of those two narrow exceptions, all driver’s \nlicense transactions are covered by the Motor Voter law, regardless of the method by which a \nvoter applies, renews or updates his or her driver’s license — the NVRA does not discriminate \nagainst voters who choose one transaction method over another. Online renewals and change-of-\naddress transactions are thus expressly covered by the NVRA’s plain text.   \n5.  The State of Texas permits certain Texas driver’s license holders to renew their \nlicense  and/or  update  the  address  on  their  license  online  on  DPS’  website  at \nwww.txdps.state.tx.us. See Ex. A, at 1. During the online process, these individuals are asked to \n2 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 1   Filed 03/14/16   Page 3 of 19\n \n \ncheck “yes” or “no” in response to the statement, “I want to register to vote.” See Ex. A, at 2; Ex. \nC, at 19. It is undisputed that, even after an eligible voter checks “yes,” Defendants fail to offer \nany means for simultaneous voter registration and fail to update the registration records of voters \nwho change their address.  \n6.  Even though the State does not use information from online change-of-address \ntransactions to properly register a voter at his or her new address, these transmissions may be \nused to cancel a voter’s prior registration record. See Tex. Elec. Code § 16.031.  \n7.  In addition to violating the NVRA, Defendants’ current practices treat similarly \nsituated voters differently based solely on how those voters choose to transact with DPS. The \nNVRA, which makes no distinction between transaction methods, cannot be used to justify this \narbitrary discrimination.   \n8.  As a result of Defendants’ failure to comply with the NVRA, each Plaintiff in this \naction was not able to cast a regular ballot in a recent election. Each Plaintiff was thus denied the \nright to voter registration that is guaranteed by the NVRA and denied an equal opportunity to \nparticipate in a federal election — for no reason other than the method through which they \ntransacted with DPS.  \n9.  Between September 2013 and May 26, 2015, the State recorded complaints from \nmore than 1,800 voters who completed an online transaction with DPS and mistakenly believed \nthat their registration records were updated too. See Ex. B. These voters certainly represent a \nmere fraction of the total number of Texas voters injured by Defendants’ conduct.   \n10.  Defendants must not be permitted to ignore constitutional and federal law. We \nrespectfully request that this Court enjoin Defendants from further violations of applicable law \nand grant Plaintiffs the relief set forth below.   \n3 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 1   Filed 03/14/16   Page 4 of 19\n \n \n  JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n11.  This case arises under the U.S. Constitution and the NVRA, a law of the United \nStates. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction of this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331 and \n28 U.S.C. § 1343(a)(4). \n12.  Defendants have received detailed notice of these violations of federal law and \nhave failed to correct the violations alleged herein within 90 days. Plaintiffs therefore have a \nprivate right of action under 52 U.S.C. § 20510(b) to enforce the NVRA. Exhibit C contains the \noriginal notice provided to Defendants on May 27, 2015 and all correspondence between the \nparties thereafter. \n13.  This Court has jurisdiction to grant both declaratory and injunctive relief pursuant \nto 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 and 2202. \n14.  This Court has personal jurisdiction over Defendants because each is a citizen of \nthe State of Texas. \n15.  Venue is proper because a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise \nto the claim occurred in this district, and each Defendant conducts business in this district. 28 \nU.S.C. § 1391(b). \nPARTIES \nPlaintiffs \n16.  Plaintiffs  —Benjamin  Hernandez,  Jarrod  Stringer,  Totysa  Watkins,  and  John \nWoods — are eligible Texas voters who were directly and individually harmed by Defendants’ \nconduct.   \n \n \n \n \n4 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 1   Filed 03/14/16   Page 5 of 19\n \n \nDefendants \n17.  Defendants are the state officials charged with ensuring Texas’ compliance with \nSections 4 and 5 of the NVRA. \n18.  Defendant Carlos H. Cascos (“Mr. Cascos”) is the Texas Secretary of State, and is \nsued in his official capacity. As Secretary of State, Mr. Cascos serves as Texas’ Chief Election \nOfficer. Tex. Elec. Code § 31.001(a). Each state’s chief election official is responsible for \ncoordinating that state’s compliance with the NVRA. 52 U.S.C. § 20509.  \n19.  Defendant Steven C. McCraw is the Director of DPS, and is sued in his official \ncapacity. DPS is Texas’ motor vehicle bureau. DPS operates offices around the state, issues \ndriver’s licenses and other state identification cards, and is responsible under state and federal \nlaw for providing voter registration services and transmitting voter registration information to the \nTexas Secretary of State. See 52 U.S.C. §§ 20503-20504; Tex. Elec. Code §§ 20.063, 20.066. \nAPPLICABLE LAW \nThe Fourteenth Amendment \n20.  The Fourteenth Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause is implicated any time a \nstate subjects voters to disparate treatment or places arbitrary restrictions upon the right to vote. \nU.S. Const. amend. XIV, § 1. \n21.  There is no “litmus test for measuring the severity of a burden that a state law \nimposes on . . . an individual voter, or a discrete class of voters. However slight that burden may \nappear, . . . it must be justified by relevant and legitimate state interests ‘sufficiently weighty to \njustify the limitation.’” Crawford v. Marion County Election Board, 553 U.S. 181, 191 (2008) \n(Stevens, J., announcing judgment of Court); accord Obama for America v. Husted, 697 F.3d \n423, 429 (6th Cir. 2012) (“When a plaintiff alleges that a state has burdened voting rights \n5 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 1   Filed 03/14/16   Page 6 of 19\n \n \nthrough  the  disparate  treatment  of  voters,  we  review  the  claim  using  the  flexible  standard \noutlined in Anderson v. Celebrezze . . . courts must weigh the burden on voters against the state’s \nasserted justifications and make the hard judgment that our adversary system demands.” (internal \nquotation marks and citations omitted)).  \nNational Voter Registration Act of 1993 \n22.  A “principal purpose” of the NVRA is to “increase the number of eligible citizens \nwho register to vote.” 52 U.S.C. § 20501(b)(1); Ferrand v. Schedler, No. 11-926, 2012 WL \n1570094 at *10 (E.D. La. May 3, 2012) (citing H.R. Rep. No. 103–66, at 19 (1993) (Conf. Rep.), \nreprinted in 1993 U.S.C.C.A.N. 140, 144); Ass’n of Cmty. Organizations for Reform Now v. \nFowler, 178 F.3d 350, 354 (5th Cir. 1999). A Senate Report on the law “makes clear that, in \nimplementing the NVRA, the ‘[g]overnment should do all it can to make registration widely and \neasily available.’” Ferrand v. Schedler, No. 11-926, 2012 WL 1570094 at *11 (E.D. La. May 3, \n2012) (citing S. Rep. No. 103–6, at 14 (1993)). \n23.  The NVRA’s “Motor Voter” provisions were meant to streamline the federal \nvoter registration process and increase voter registration accessibility: \n[I]ncorporating voter registration into the drivers licensing process provides a \nsecure and convenient method for registering voters; an effective means of \nreaching groups of individuals generally considered hard-to-reach for voting \npurposes . . .; and a procedure for keeping rolls current through contact with \nlicensees who change addresses.  \n \nS. Rep. 103-6, at 5 (1993). \n \n24.  Indeed, under the Motor Voter provisions, every time an eligible Texas voter \nobtains, renews, or updates his or her driver’s license with DPS, the State must simultaneously \nregister that person to vote or update that voter’s registration records, unless the person fails to \n6 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 1   Filed 03/14/16   Page 7 of 19\n \n \nsign the registration form or attests that the change-of-address information is not for voter \nregistration purposes. 52 U.S.C. §§ 20503, 20504; 20507.  \n25.  In relevant part, 52 U.S.C § 20504 provides that: \nEach  State  motor  vehicle  driver’s  license  application  (including  any  renewal \napplication) submitted to the appropriate State motor vehicle authority under State \nlaw shall serve as an application for voter registration with respect to elections for \nFederal office unless the applicant fails to sign the voter registration application . . \n. any change of address form submitted in accordance with State law for purposes \nof a State motor vehicle driver’s license shall serve as notification of change of \naddress for voter registration with respect to elections for Federal office for the \nregistrant involved unless the registrant states on the form that the change of \naddress is not for voter registration purposes.  \n \n26.  The State may not “require any information that duplicates information required \nin the driver’s license portion of the form,” other than extra information expressly enumerated by \nstatute.  Id.  at  §  20504(c)(2)(A).  Instead,  the  NVRA  demands  that  eligible  voters  shall  be \nregistered to vote “simultaneously” with the submission of any driver’s license application, \nrenewal or change-of-address form. See id. at § 20503(a)(1)(1).  \n27.  DPS  must  promptly  transmit  completed  voter  registration  applications  and \nchange-of-address information to election officials; generally, transmission must occur no later \nthan 10 days after receipt. See id. at § 20504(e). \nTexas Election Code \n28.  Shortly after the NVRA was enacted in 1993, the State of Texas updated the \nTexas Election Code to reinforce the NVRA’s Motor Voter mandates. See generally Tex. Elec. \nCode §§ 20.061-66. \n29.  For instance, state law specifies that DPS must use “a form and procedure that \ncombines the department’s application form for a license or card with an officially prescribed \nvoter registration application form.” Id. at § 20.062(a).   \n7 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 1   Filed 03/14/16   Page 8 of 19\n \n \n30.  DPS must also provide a “change of address form and procedure that combines \ndepartment and voter registration functions,” so that when a voter submits a change of address, \nthat “serves as a change of address for voter registration” as well, unless the individual indicates \notherwise. Id. at § 20.063(c); id. at § 20.062(a).  \n31.  In addition, if a “correct driver’s license number or personal identification card \nnumber” or if “correct residence address or mailing address” information is missing from a \nregistration  application,  DPS  employees  have  a  duty  to  correct  the  voter’s  application  by \n“enter[ing] the information on the application.” Id. at § 20.063(d). \n32.  Finally,  voter  registration  applications  and  change-of-address  forms  must  be \npromptly delivered to election officials. Specifically, “[n]ot later than the fifth day after the date \na person completes a voter registration application and provides an electronic signature to the \ndepartment, [DPS] shall electronically transfer the applicant’s voter registration data, including \nthe applicant’s signature, to the [Texas Secretary of State].” Id. at § 20.066; see also id. at § \n20.065.  \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \n33.  Exhibit C contains the original notice provided to Defendants on May 27, 2015 \nand all correspondence between the parties thereafter. The factual allegations set forth in those \nletters are incorporated by reference in this Complaint.  \nDPS Does Not Provide Simultaneous Voter Registration with Online Transactions \n34.  DPS encourages Texans to use a number of online services through its website, \nwww.txdps.state.tx.us, an official governmental website for the State of Texas.  \n35.  DPS invites many Texas driver’s license holders to renew their license and/or \nupdate the address information associated with their license online through a portion of its \n8 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 1   Filed 03/14/16   Page 9 of 19\n \n \nwebsite  entitled  “Driver  License  Renewal  and  Change  of  Address,”  available  at \nhttps://txapps.texas.gov/tolapp/txdl/.  \n36.  Defendants’  Driver  License  Renewal  and  Change  of  Address  website  page \nprovides a single online portal for qualified holders of a Texas driver’s license to renew their \ndriver’s licenses, update the address listed on their driver’s licenses, or both.  \n37.  The online process involves eight “Steps to Complete,” including the following \nsteps: Welcome, Login, Select Services, Enter Address, Select Options, Review Order, Submit \nPayment, and Receipt. See Ex. A, at 1; Ex. C, at 19. \n38.  When users reach Step 5 of this online process, Defendants prompt the users to \nanswer whether they want to register to vote. See Ex. A, at 2; Ex. C, at 19. If, however, an \neligible voter checks “yes” under the statement “I want to register to vote,” Defendants do not \nregister that voter to vote and do not update that voter’s registration records.  \n39.  Unlike Defendants’ simultaneous voter registration services for license renewal or \naddress update applications submitted in-person at a DPS office, Defendants do not provide for \nsimultaneous voter registration as required by the NVRA at any point during the online license \nrenewal or address update process. Rather than providing any simultaneous opportunity for voter \nregistration, the DPS website directs voters to an entirely different website, where voters must \n“download[] or request[]” a physical voter registration form.1  \n40.  Specifically, Step 5 includes the following statement: \nSelecting “Yes” does not register you to vote. A link to the Secretary of State \nVoter website (where a voter application may be downloaded or requested) will \nbe available on your receipt page. \n \n                                                 \n1 “Simultaneous” means “existing or occurring at the same time: exactly coincident.” Definition of Simultaneous by \nMerriam-Webster, Merriam-Webster, http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/simultaneous (last visited March \n8, 2016).  \n9 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 1   Filed 03/14/16   Page 10 of 19\n \n \n41.  Then, in order to register to vote, or to update address information, following an \nonline transaction, an eligible voter must complete a number of additional steps. He or she must \ncomplete a separate voter registration form, print it out (if using a PDF version), and mail the \nform  to  the  appropriate  county  registrar  (after  looking  up  that  address)  before  the  voter \nregistration deadline. \n42.  Defendant Secretary of State’s publication, 32nd Annual Election Law Seminar \nHandbook2 confirms that “[i]f the [DPS] transaction was made online, then the person is not \nregistered to vote.” According to this handbook, “[b]y selecting ‘yes’ when updating information \nthrough DPS online renewal [the voter] is merely  requesting a link to a voter registration \napplication on the individual’s receipt page.”  \n43.  This process stands in stark contrast to DPS’ procedures for registering eligible \nTexas residents who renew a driver’s license and/or update address information in person at a \nDPS office. As DPS recently confirmed, for in-person customers who wish to register to vote, \nDPS “electronically transfer[s] to the Secretary of State (SOS) the name and relevant data \nregarding each applicant who is of voting age and a United States citizen who affirmatively \nanswered  the  voter  registration  question”  at  the  end  of  each  business  day.  Ex.  C,  at  134. \nHowever, when the exact same information is submitted online by an eligible voter who is \nidentically situated but chose to use DPS’ online system rather than visit the office in person, that \nvoter’s “name and relevant data” is never transferred to election officials.  \n44.  Even though Defendants refuse to use information from online change-of-address \ntransactions to properly register voters at their new addresses, they are certainly capable of using \nthis information to do so. In fact, Defendants may use the same online information to cancel a \n                                                 \n2 On file with Counsel for Plaintiffs. \n10 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 1   Filed 03/14/16   Page 11 of 19\n \n \nvoter’s prior registration record even though they fail to give voters any notice of this possibility. \nSee Tex. Elec. Code § 16.031. \n45.  Defendants  further  confuse  voters  like  Plaintiffs  with  the  portion  of  DPS’ \nwebpage that provides answers to frequent inquiries about the online renewal and change-of-\naddress  processes.  Defendants  fail  to  indicate  here  that  voter  registration  files  are  not \nsimultaneously updated. See Ex. E. DPS also fails to explain on its website that completing DPS’ \nonline change-of-address form may jeopardize a voter’s registration status at his or her former \nresidence. Id.  \nDefendants’ Conduct Injures Each Plaintiff \n \n46.  Benjamin  Hernandez:  Mr.  Hernandez  moved  to  Dallas  County  from  Ector \nCounty in February 2013. That month, he updated his driver’s license address online, and \nbelieved that his voter registration records were updated as well. On Election Day 2014, Mr. \nHernandez attempted to vote in Dallas County, but was told that his name was not on the rolls in \nDallas County. Mr. Hernandez cast a provisional ballot, but later received notice that his vote \nwas not counted. \n47.  Jarrod Stringer: Mr. Stringer moved from Tarrant County to Bexar County on \nAugust 1, 2014. Within the same week, Mr. Stringer updated his driver’s license address online, \nand believed that his voter registration records were updated as well. Mr. Stringer attempted to \nvote early in the 2014 general election, but was told that his name was not on the rolls in Bexar \nCounty. Mr. Stringer then called Bexar County election officials, and was told that he was not \nregistered in Bexar and could only vote a limited ballot with state-wide candidates, because he \nwas still registered at his former address. When Mr. Stringer explained that he had changed his \n11 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 1   Filed 03/14/16   Page 12 of 19\n \n \naddress through DPS’ website, the election officials with whom he spoke told Mr. Stringer that \nthe county was aware of “problems at DPS.”  \n48.  Totysa Watkins: Ms. Watkins moved from Denton County to Dallas County in \n2011. After moving, she changed her driver’s license address online, and believed that her voter \nregistration records were updated as well. In September 2013, Ms. Watkins moved within Irving, \nwhich is in Dallas County, and once again changed her driver’s license address and attempted to \nupdate her voter registration online through DPS’ website. Ms. Watkins attempted to vote on \nElection Day 2014, but was told by an election worker that she was not registered in Dallas \nCounty.  She  cast  a  provisional  ballot.  A  few  weeks  later,  Ms.  Watkins  received  a  notice \nindicating that her vote was not counted and then received two new voter registration cards.  \n49.  John Woods: Dr. Woods moved from Travis County to Harris County in June \n2015. In September 2015, Dr. Woods changed his driver’s license address online, and believed \nthat his voter registration records were updated as well. Shortly thereafter, Dr. Woods went to a \nlocal  library,  where  he  was  offered  an  opportunity  to  register  to  vote.  He  declined  that \nopportunity, however, because he believed that his voter registration records had already been \nupdated. Dr. Woods called Harris County on Election Day 2015, trying to identify his polling \nlocation. Dr. Woods was informed that he was not registered in Harris County, but was still \nregistered in Travis County, and that any provisional ballot cast in Harris County would likely \nnot be counted. Nonetheless, Dr. Woods went to his local polling location and cast a provisional \nballot.  \n50.  Each Plaintiff believed that he or she was properly registered because he or she \ncompleted an online transaction with DPS, attempted to update his or her registration records, \nand later received an updated driver’s license in the mail.   \n12 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 1   Filed 03/14/16   Page 13 of 19\n \n \n51.  Plaintiffs only learned of DPS’ registration failures when they arrived at the polls \nand were denied a regular ballot.   \n52.  No Plaintiff was informed that completing DPS’ online change-of-address form \ncould jeopardize his or her registration status at his or her former residence pursuant to current \nlaw.  \n53.  The  conduct  that  harmed  Plaintiffs  is  ongoing.  Moreover,  Defendants  have \nrepeatedly maintained that they are unwilling to change the policies and practices that caused the \ninjuries described herein. See Ex. C.     \nDefendants’ Voter Registration Failures Harm Countless Texas Voters \n \n54.  As a result of Defendants’ failure to comply with the NVRA, countless eligible \nTexas residents have been denied the right to voter registration, which is guaranteed by the \nNVRA.  \n55.  Indeed, according to its own data, between September 2013 and May 26, 2015, \nthe State recorded complaints from more than 1,800 voters who completed an online transaction \nwith DPS and mistakenly believed that their registration records were updated as well.  \n56.  For all of the reasons laid out in Plaintiffs’ May 27, 2015 notice letter, Exhibit C, \nat 2-21, the voters who complained almost certainly represent just a fraction of the total affected \nduring that time frame. Indeed, the State’s records capture only those voters who contacted \nelection workers, specifically complained about registration problems at DPS, and had their files \ninvestigated — surely, not all affected voters complained; others may have reported problems \nbut had their complaints disregarded by election workers. Further, the data provided by the State \ncomes from just 123 of Texas’ 254 counties, strongly suggesting that the data set itself is \nincomplete. See Ex. B; Ex. C, at 9. \n13 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 1   Filed 03/14/16   Page 14 of 19\n \n \n57.  Notably, numerous emails, obtained through public records requests, establish \nthat DPS officials and high-ranking employees in the Secretary of State’s office have had actual \nknowledge of the significant and widespread confusion caused by the State’s treatment of online \nDPS transactions since at least 2012. See Ex. C, at 15; Ex. D. But, to date, Defendants have taken \nno significant steps to remedy these problems.  \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nCount I \nSubjecting Plaintiffs to Arbitrary Treatment in Violation  \nof the Right to Equal Protection \n \n58.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference the allegations contained in Paragraphs 33 \nthrough 57 as if fully set forth herein. \n59.  By  arbitrarily  subjecting  Plaintiffs  to  disparate  voter  registration  standards, \nDefendants  have  denied  Plaintiffs  an  equal  opportunity  to  participate  in  federal  and  state \nelections in violation of Section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment. As a result of this disparate \ntreatment, Plaintiffs were denied their right to vote.   \nCount II \nFailure to Treat Driver’s License Renewal Transactions  \nas Voter Registration Applications  \n \n60.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference the allegations contained in Paragraphs 33 \nthrough 57 as if fully set forth herein. \n61.

McCraw, in his official capacity as Director of the Texas Department of Public  \nSafety (“DPS”), (“Defendants”), hereby move the Court for summary judgment in their favor on \nall of Plaintiffs’ claims. \nINTRODUCTION \n  This case concerns the application of the National Voter Registration Act (“NVRA”), 52 \nU.S.C. §§20501-20511, to Texas’s online service offerings for licensed drivers in the State.  \nPlaintiffs are three Texas residents who allege that Defendants did not “simultaneously” update \ntheir voter registration information in connection with an online change of address each Plaintiff \nmade to his Texas driver license.  Plaintiffs allege that Defendants have violated the NVRA and \n                                                 \n1 When this lawsuit was filed, Carlos H. Cascos was Texas’s Secretary of State. On January 5, 2017, Rolando Pablos \ntook over this position. Secretary Pablos is therefore now listed as the Defendant in this cause. See FED. R. CIV. P. \n25(d), “[a]n action does not abate when a public officer who is a party in an official capacity dies, resigns, or otherwise \nceases to hold office while the action is pending. The officer’s successor is automatically substituted as a party. Later \nproceedings should be in the substituted party’s name[.]” \n1 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 82   Filed 07/18/17   Page 2 of 25\nthe Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution. They make this claim despite the \nfact  that  no  Plaintiff  provided  a  written,  signed  request  to  update  his  voter  registration \ninformation—as Texas law requires—in connection with his online changes of address.   \nNotably, this is not a case of first impression. NVRA claims related to alleged voter \nregistration delays occurring in the context of online driver license change of address applications \nhave previously been considered and dismissed by Judge Lee Rosenthal and the Fifth Circuit for \nincurably failing to state a claim on which relief could be granted. Broyles v. Texas, 618 F. Supp. \n2d 661, 690 (S.D. Tex. 2009) (dismissing plaintiffs’ claim against the State because they did not \nprovide notice and the alleged voter registration delays did not affect votes in a federal election) \naff’d 381 F. App’x 370 (5th Cir. 2010). The same analysis compels the dismissal of the Plaintiffs’ \nclaims here because they have not complied with the NVRA’s mandatory notice provision. \nMoreover, and any conceivable, non-mooted injury is insufficient to support an actionable NVRA \nclaim because it is undisputed that each Plaintiff is currently registered to vote in upcoming federal \nelections at his current residence.  \nAs discussed below, Plaintiffs’ claims fail as a matter of law for a variety of independent \nreasons. First, Plaintiffs lack statutory standing because it is undisputed that—following their \npurported “notice” letters2 to the State—Defendants offered their assistance in confirming each \nPlaintiffs’ voter registration and assisting any Plaintiff that wanted to update his information. \nSecond, Plaintiffs also lack Article III standing because they cannot establish that their claims are \ntraceable to Defendants’ conduct or redressable. In particular, it is undisputed that all of the \nPlaintiffs have had their voter registration information updated, and each testified that they intend \n                                                 \n2 Mr. Hernandez was individually identified in a May 27, 2015 letter purporting to provide notice. See Doc. 1, Ex. C \nat pp. 2-17 Mr. Stringer and Dr. Woods were not individually identified until Plaintiffs sent additional letters on \nOctober 23, 2015, and November 18, 2015, respectively. Id. at pp. 171-72; 195-96 . The Original Complaint was filed \non March 14, 2016. \n2 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 82   Filed 07/18/17   Page 3 of 25\nto submit the written, signed request required by State law, should he wish to update his voter \nregistration information in the future. Accordingly, Plaintiffs’ claims are moot, and are not subject \nto the capable-of-repetition, but evading review exception to mootness. Third, Plaintiffs claims \nalso fail on their merits as the NVRA expressly incorporates state law into the provisions under \nwhich Plaintiffs assert their claims. And relevant Texas law—which Plaintiffs do not challenge—\nrequires individuals who wish to update their voter registration information to submit a written, \nsigned request to do so. The only exception to this requirement exists in the context of online \nchanges of address for voter registration purposes within a single county, and this exception is \nexpressly provided for by State law. TEX. ELEC. CODE §15.021(d). Plaintiffs’ claims also fail to \nthe extent any non-mooted injury is not related to voting in a federal election. Finally, the equal \nprotection claims fail because Plaintiffs have not—and cannot—identify any similarly-situated \ncomparator who was treated differently when completing the same online change of address \ntransaction. For these reasons, judgment as a matter of law in favor of Defendants is warranted on \nall of Plaintiffs’ claims.  \nSTATEMENT OF RELEVANT UNDISPUTED FACTS \nI.  The Elections Clause of the Constitution Provides the State Authority to Prescribe \nthe Time, Places, and Manner in Conducting Federal Elections. \n \nThe Elections Clause of the United States Constitution provides, “[t]he Times, Places and \nManner of holding Elections for Senators and Representatives, shall be prescribed in each State \nby the  Legislature thereof; but the Congress may  at  any time by  Law make or alter such \nRegulations, except as to the places of chusing Senators.” U.S. CONST. art. I, §4 cl. 1. “The \nElections Clause has two functions. Upon the States it imposes the duty (‘shall be prescribed’) to \nprescribe the time, place, and manner of electing Representatives and Senators; upon Congress it \n3 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 82   Filed 07/18/17   Page 4 of 25\nconfers the power to alter those regulations or supplant them altogether.” Arizona v. Inter Tribal \nCouncil of Arizona, Inc., 133 S. Ct. 2247, 2253 (2013) (citation omitted). \nThis yields States significant latitude, absent specific Congressional directive. Indeed, \n“[t]he Clause’s substantive scope is broad. ‘Times, Places, and Manner,’ [the Supreme Court has] \nwritten, are ‘comprehensive words,’ which ‘embrace authority to provide a complete code for \ncongressional elections,’ including[,]” as relevant here, “regulations relating to ‘registration.’” Id. \nat 2253 (quoting Smiley v. Holm, 285 U.S. 355, 366 (1932)) (citing Roudebush v. Hartke, 405 U.S. \n15, 24–25, (1972) (recounts); United States v. Classic, 313 U.S. 299, 320 (1941) (primaries)). \nII.  Voter Registration in Texas \nThe Defendants each play a part in implementing the NVRA in Texas. TEX. ELEC. CODE \n§31.001(a) (SOS is chief election officer); id. §§20.061 et seq. (DPS is a voter registration \nagency).3 Voter registration in Texas is, and has historically been, a county-based system. TEX. \nELEC. CODE §12.001 (“The county tax assessor-collector is the voter registrar for the county unless \nthe position of county elections administrator is created or the county clerk is designated as the \nvoter registrar.”). DPS and SOS work within this county-based system to implement the NVRA’s \nrequirement that each State “establish procedures to register to vote in elections for Federal office \nby application made simultaneously with an application for a motor vehicle driver’s license \npursuant to [§]20504 of this title.” 52 U.S.C. §20503(a)(1). \nPlaintiffs contend that there are two types of motor vehicle driver license transactions at \nissue in this case: changes of address and renewals; however, it is undisputed that no Plaintiff is \n                                                 \n3 SOS also works with other designated voter registration agencies. See TEX. ELEC. CODE Ch. 20. \nThose agencies are not addressed here because they are not named in this case. \n4 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 82   Filed 07/18/17   Page 5 of 25\nasserting they were injured due to a renewal transaction. Doc. 1, ¶¶ 5, 46, 47, 49. With respect to \nrenewals, the NVRA provides that \n[e]ach State motor vehicle driver’s license application (including any renewal \napplication) submitted to the appropriate State motor vehicle authority under State \nlaw shall serve as an application for voter registration with respect to elections for \nFederal office unless the applicant fails to sign the voter registration application.  \n \n52 U.S.C. §20504(a)(1) (emphasis supplied). \nWith respect to changes of address, the NVRA further provides that \nany change of address form submitted in accordance with State law for purposes of \na State motor vehicle driver’s license shall serve as notification of change of address \nfor voter registration with respect to elections for Federal office for the registrant \ninvolved unless the registrant states on the form that the change of address is not \nfor voter registration purposes. \n \nId. §20504(d) (emphasis supplied).  It is undisputed that under the NVRA in order to be registered \nto vote or submit a change of address, the person must “sign the registration form or attest[] that \nthe change-of-address information is not for voter registration purposes.”  See Doc. 1, ¶ 24. \nThe NVRA also specifies certain “forms and procedures” for voter registration applications \nsubject to the Act. Such applications in connection with DPS transactions may require the \n“minimum amount of information necessary to prevent duplicate voter registrations and enable \nState election officials to assess the eligibility of the applicant and to administer voter registration \nand other parts of the election process.” Id. §20504(c)(2)(B). These applications further “shall \ninclude  a  statement  that—(i)  states  each  eligibility  requirement  (including  citizenship);  (ii) \ncontains an attestation that the applicant meets each such requirement; and (iii) requires the \nsignature of the applicant, under penalty of perjury.” Id. §20504(c)(2)(C)(iii). They may also \nrequire a “second signature.”  Id. §20504(c)(2)(A).   \nCompleted applications “shall be made available (as submitted by the applicant, or in \nmachine readable or other format) to the appropriate State election official as provided by State \n5 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 82   Filed 07/18/17   Page 6 of 25\nlaw.” Id. §20504(c)(2)(E). Information collected in connection with both changes of address and \nonline renewals “shall be transmitted to the appropriate State election official not later than 10 \ndays after the date of acceptance.” Id. §20504(e)(1). \nThe Texas Legislature has provided for NVRA implementation at DPS through in person \nor by mail transactions as follows: \nThe Department of Public Safety shall provide to each person who applies in person \nat the department’s offices for an original or renewal of a driver’s license, a personal \nidentification card, or a duplicate or corrected license or card an opportunity to \ncomplete a voter registration application form. \n \nWhen  the  department  processes  a  license  or  card  for  renewal  by  mail,  the \ndepartment shall deliver to the applicant by mail a voter registration application \nform. \n \nA change of address that relates to a license or card and that is submitted to the \ndepartment in person or by mail serves as a change of address for voter registration \nunless  the  licensee  or  cardholder  indicates  that  the  change  is  not  for  voter \nregistration purposes. \n \nTEX. ELEC. CODE §20.063(a)-(c). \nTexas law further provides, as to in person and by mail transactions only: \nAt the end of each day a [DPS] office is regularly open for business, the manager \nof the office shall deliver by mail or in person to the voter registrar of the county in \nwhich  the  office  is  located  each  completed  voter  registration  application  and \napplicable change of address submitted to a department employee. \n \nEach weekday the department is regularly open for business, the department shall \nelectronically transfer to the secretary of state the name of each person who \ncompletes  a  voter  registration  application  submitted  to  the  department.  The \nsecretary shall prescribe procedures necessary to implement this subsection. \n \nOn the weekday the [SOS] is regularly open for business following the date the \nsecretary receives information under Subsection (b), the secretary shall inform the \nappropriate voter registrar of the name of each person who completes a voter \nregistration application submitted to the department. The registrar may verify that \nthe registrar has received each application as indicated by the information provided \nby the secretary under this subsection. \n \n6 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 82   Filed 07/18/17   Page 7 of 25\nId.  §20.065(a)-(c).  Finally,  Texas  law  further  provides,  as  to  by  mail  and  in  person  DPS \ntransactions only \nIf a person completes a voter registration application as provided by Section 20.063, \nthe Department of Public Safety shall: (1)  input the information provided on the \napplication  into  the  department's  electronic  data  system;  and  (2)    inform  the \napplicant that the applicant's electronic signature provided to the department will \nbe used for submitting the applicant's voter registration application. \n \nId. §20.066(a) (emphasis supplied).   \n \nThus, in the context of by person and by mail  types of applications through DPS, and these \ntypes of applications only, Texas law provides for the applicant to consent to use of an electronic \nsignature in submitting a voter registration application. See TEX. ELEC. CODE § 20.066.  Section \n13.002 of the Texas Election Code, however, still applies to these applications.  It provides, among \nother things, in (b), that “[a] registration application must be in writing and signed by the \napplicant.”  See also Ingram Depo. 97:4-98:5; Schonhoff II Depo. 49:10-14 (“It has to do with \n13.002, which the NVRA grants states the right to come up with procedures for implementing the \nNVRA in its totality.  And that 13.002 is the signature component that [Dr. Hersh] disregards in \nits entirety.”).  For in-person or mail driver license’s applications, an applicant physically signs a \ndocument. Ingram Depo. 99:7-99:24; Schonhoff Depo. 123:24-124:5 (“Q. When an individual \nchanges their address by mail at DPS, does the form they mail in to request that change have to be \nsigned?  A.  Yes.  Under 20.063, if it’s not signed it’s not eligible for registration.  Under 20.066, \nif it’s not signed, then it doesn’t get – then they are not eligible to have the signature transmitted.”’); \nSchonhoff Depo. 119:19-120:15 (“Q.  So I just want to be very clear on the record about what \nhappens in a DPS office in the context of how Mr. Herse is characterizing it in Paragraph 17 here.  \nWhen an individual is in the DPS office and they respond affirmatively to the voter registration \nquestion, how many signatures do they provide and how do they provide those signatures?  A.  \n7 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 82   Filed 07/18/17   Page 8 of 25\nOkay.  So it’s my understanding that they will provide one signature on the DPS application that \nalso serves as a voter registration application.  That is under 13.002.  20.063 allows for that \napplication to be completed in person with the form – combined form for DPS.  The requirements \nare 13.002, which means written and signed at the time that they’re trying to register to vote.  When \nthey turn that form over, then the DPS agent will enter the information on the form provided and \nhave the person sign the keypad or the signature capture pad to provide the physical signature, \nwhich is electronically captured.  Q.  So there are two signatures provided in the DPS office under \nsuch circumstances? A. That’s correct.”)  \nWhile some licensees may renew their license or change their address online, there is no \nspecific  statutory  provision  which  directly  addresses  online  transactions  at  DPS  and  voter \nregistration, but like all voter registrations in Texas (including those in person and by mail at DPS), \nSection 13.002 of the Texas Election Code also applies, and thus in writing, signature requirements \napply.4  Similarly, for change of address forms, the Texas Election Code is very specific that a \nsignature must be provided, with one exception not relevant to any of the Plaintiffs here.  Section \n15.021 of the Texas Election Code provides, in relevant part: \n(a)  If a voter discovers incorrect information on the voter's registration certificate or if any \nof the information becomes incorrect because of a change in circumstances, the voter shall \npromptly submit to the registrar a written, signed notice of the incorrect information and \nthe corresponding correction. \n… \n(d)  A voter who continues to reside in the county in which the voter is registered may \ncorrect information under this section by digital transmission of the information under a \nprogram  administered  by  the  secretary  of  state  and  the  Department  of  Information \nResources. \n(e)  The secretary of state shall adopt rules to: (1) approve technologies for submitting \nchanges of registration information by digital transmission under this section; and (2)  \n                                                 \n4 As an example, an applicant for voter registration may fax his or her application for registration under 13.002 and \n13.143 (d-2) of the Texas Election Code, but the original must follow by mail, thereby maintaining the requirement \nthat there be a physical signature.  See TEX. ELEC. CODE §§ 13.002; 13.143(d-2); Schonhoff Depo. 53:4-6 (“There’s \na fax option, but the original has to come by mail, which leads to an original signature.”) \n8 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 82   Filed 07/18/17   Page 9 of 25\nprescribe  additional  procedures  as  necessary  to  implement  a  system  for  the  digital \ntransmission of changes in registration information. \n \n(emphasis supplied).  Therefore, Texas law only permits in county changes of address, which do \nnot relate to any allegation by the Plaintiffs, to be transmitted without a signature; out of county \nchanges of address like those alleged by the Plaintiffs must be in writing and signed. \nOnline renewal and changes of address with DPS are permitted if, among other things, the \napplicant is a U.S. Citizen with a Social Security number on file who most recently renewed in \nperson. Importantly, it is undisputed that there is no physical signature provided by the individual \nat the time the voter completes an online change of address or renewal transaction with DPS, unlike \nas there is for in person or by mail transactions with DPS.  Moreover, there is no such language in \nthe Texas Election Code relating to consent to use of an electronic signature for transactions \nconducted online with DPS, unlike as there is for in person or by mail transactions with DPS. \nIngram  Depo.  99:25-100:3  (“In  an  online  transaction,  there  is  no  physical  signature  made, \nelectronically captured or otherwise.”). Because Texas.gov’s online interface does not capture an \nimage of a voter’s signature, those who utilize it receive a link to a voter registration application \nthey must print, sign and mail in order to update their voter registration. Compare Doc. 1, Ex. A \nat p. 2 (“Selecting ‘yes’ does not register you to vote. A link to the [SOS] voter website (where a \nvoter application may be downloaded or requested) will be available on your receipt page.”) \n(emphasis original) with id., Ex. D. at p. 25 (voter registration application requiring signature). See \nalso, e.g., TEX. ELEC. CODE §§ 13.002; 15.021; 52 U.S.C. §20504(c)(2)(C)(iii) (voter registration \napplications must be signed); id. §20504(c)(2)(A) (applications may require second signature); id. \n§20504(a)(1) (renewal is not for voter registration purposes if applicant “fails to sign the voter \nregistration application” or  does not meet other State requirements).  The primary purpose of these \nsignatures is to comply with requirements for registration, although physical signatures may be \n9 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 82   Filed 07/18/17   Page 10 of 25\nused in the context of verifying signatures on absentee ballots.  See Schonhoff Depo. 101:3 – 15; \n102:20-21 (“The primary purpose of the signature is registration.”) \nIII.  Plaintiffs’ Allegations \nA.  Plaintiffs can present no evidence that they completed the steps that Texas law \nrequires of any individual who wishes to update voter registration information.  \n \nPlaintiffs are three Texas residents who allege that they completed online transactions in \n2014 or 2015 on Texas.gov to change the address on their driver licenses. Doc. 1, ¶¶ 46-47, 49. At \nthat time, the Texas.gov interface contained a box asking the driver license holder whether they \nwanted to register to vote or update their voter registration information. Doc. 1, Ex. A at p. 2. The \nTexas.gov interface further made clear that “[s]electing ‘yes’ does not register you to vote. A link \nto the [SOS] voter website (where a voter application may be downloaded or requested) will be \navailable on your receipt page.” Id. No Plaintiff has alleged or provided evidence that he completed \nthe SOS voter application. See, e.g., Doc. 1, ¶¶ 46-49; Hernandez Depo. 28:16-28:19; Stringer \nDepo. 32:2-32:19; Woods Depo. 55:14-55:16.  \nB.  Plaintiff Woods has not been denied the ability to cast a vote in a federal election, each \nPlaintiff is registered to vote at his desired address, and no Plaintiff was denied the \nopportunity to cast ballot in the 2016 federal general election. \n \nPlaintiffs bring this action based on particular driver license changes of address made \nthrough Texas.gov, each in connection with a particular move.  Hernandez moved in 2013 from \nEctor to Dallas County. Hernandez Depo. 28:16-22. Stringer moved from Tarrant to Bexar County \nin August 2014. Stringer Depo. 31:1-31:8. In 2015, Woods moved from West Virginia to Houston, \nTexas and changed his driver’s license address from an old address in Austin to his new address \nin Houston.  Woods Depo. 62:11-63:9. None of the Plaintiffs renewed his driver license in \nconnection with these moves. See Hernandez Depo. 28:16-28:19; Stringer Depo. 32:2-32:19; \nWoods Depo. 55:14-55:16.  \n10 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 82   Filed 07/18/17   Page 11 of 25\nHernandez alleges that he was forced to cast a provisional ballot in a 2014 election. Doc. \n1, ¶46. Likewise, Stringer alleges that he could only vote for state and local ballot questions in a \n2014 election. Id.  On the other hand, Woods only brings this cause of action based upon a non-\nfederal 2015 election. Id. at ¶ 49; see also Ex. C (Answer to Request for Admission # 15).  \nPlaintiffs purported to provide the State with pre-suit “notice” of their alleged claims. \nDefendants offered assistance to each Plaintiff (and any other individual with voter registration \nquestions  of  whom  Plaintiffs  or  their  counsel  was  aware)—including  to  confirming  voter \nregistration status, assisting with updating voter registration information, and answering any other \nquestions about the voter registration process.  See Exs. A, B, C (Answers to Requests for \nAdmission #9). See also, e.g., Doc. 1 Ex. C at 27-28; 45. Today,  as was the case prior to the end \nof the “notice period, each Plaintiff is registered to vote at the address where he wishes to be \nregistered, and each was able to cast a ballot in the 2016 federal general election.

Legal Standard for Summary Judgment \n \nSummary judgment is appropriate if no genuine issue of material fact exists and the moving \nparty is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. See Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323 \n(1986). For this analysis, the evidence is examined in the light most favorable to the nonmovant. \nColson v. Grohman, 174 F.3d 498, 506 (5th Cir. 1999). But “[w]here critical evidence is so weak \nor tenuous on an essential fact that it could not support a judgment in favor of the nonmovant, or \nwhere it is so overwhelming that it mandates judgment in favor of the movant, summary judgment \nis appropriate.” Alton v. Texas A&M Univ., 168 F.3d 196, 199 (5th Cir. 1999). “If the record as a \nwhole could not lead a rational jury to find for the nonmoving party, there is no genuine issue for \ntrial and summary judgment is warranted.” Wheeler v. Miller, 168 F.3d 241, 247 (5th Cir. 1999).  \nII.  Plaintiffs Have Not Established Standing for Any of Their Claims. \nA.  Plaintiffs lack statutory standing, because Defendants addressed all of their voter \nregistration concerns once aware of them.  \n \n12 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 82   Filed 07/18/17   Page 13 of 25\nAs an initial matter, Plaintiffs lack standing because it is undisputed that, during the notice \nperiod, Defendants took action to correct any alleged voter registration issue each Plaintiff had.  \nCongress’s abrogation of Defendants’ immunity is conditioned on a plaintiff’s compliance \nwith the NVRA’s notice provision. 52 U.S.C. §20510(b)(1)-(2). The statute provides, in relevant \npart, that before a plaintiff can file suit, he or she must “provide written notice of the violation to \nthe chief election official of the State involved.” Id.  “[T]he purpose of the notice requirement was \nto  ‘provide  states...an  opportunity  to  attempt  compliance  before  facing  litigation.’”  Scott  v. \nSchedler, 771 F.3d 831, 835-36 (5th Cir. 2014) (quoting ACORN v. Miller, 129 F.3d 833, 838 (6th \nCir.1997)) (alterations in Scott). A state then has 90 days to attempt to correct the violation. 52 \nU.S.C. §20510(b)(1)-(2).5 Critically, a plaintiff does not have standing to sue if the alleged \nviolation is corrected during the notice period. Id.; Scott, 771 F.3d at 836. \nIn determining what action a state can take to correct an alleged violation, the Fifth \nCircuit’s decision in Scott is instructive. There, the NCAAP and an individual plaintiff (Scott) \nalleged  that  Louisiana  public  assistance  offices  were  committing  systemic  and  continuing \nviolations of NVRA in handling responses to the voter registration question on applications for \npublic benefits. Scott, 771 F.3d at 833. Prior to suit, the NCAAP provided notice of the alleged \nviolations, but Scott’s name was not included in the notice. Id. at 835. As a result, the Fifth Circuit \nruled that Scott could not piggyback on the NCAAP’s notice and establish standing in his own \nright. Id. at 836. Critically, in finding that Scott lacked standing, the Court noted that when \nLouisiana was provided notice of Scott’s allegation, it “attempted to provide Scott with voter \nregistration forms” and that this attempt was “‘exactly’” what the “‘pre-litigation notice was meant \nto encourage.’” Id. (quoting Ga. State Conf. of NAACP v. Kemp, 841 F.Supp.2d 1320, 1336 (N.D. \n                                                 \n5 A shorter notice period of 20 days applies where a plaintiff alleges that a violation that took place within 120 days \nof a federal election. 52 U.S.C. § 20510(b)(2). \n13 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 82   Filed 07/18/17   Page 14 of 25\nGa. 2012)).  Ultimately, the Fifth Circuit held that due to his failure to comply with the NVRA’s \nnotice provision  he lacked standing to seek relief for himself or “for others, either.” Id. \nThe same rationale defeats Plaintiffs’ standing here.  They lack standing for the simple fact \nthat each Plaintiffs’ alleged voter registration issues6 were corrected prior to the end of the notice \nperiod. See Ex. I (Hernandez TEAM Record, showing an Effective Date of Registration of \nDecember 14, 2014; Stringer TEAM Record, showing an Effective Date of Registration of May \n23, 2015, and Woods TEAM Record, showing an Effective Date of Registration of December 3, \n2015).   Indeed, this fact is undisputed—each Plaintiff admits that Defendants offered to confirm \nhis voter registration status, and assist in updating his voter registration information. See Exs. A, \nB, C (at Requests for Admission #9); see also Doc. 1, Ex. C. Further, each Plaintiff is currently \nregistered to vote at his desired location and was able to vote in the 2016 federal general election. \nSee  Exs.  A  (Request  for  Admission  #17),  B  Request  for  Admission  #17),  C  (Request  for \nAdmission #16); Stringer Depo. 48:2-7; Woods Depo. 72:22-74:11; Hernandez Depo. 39:4-9; Ex. \nI. As multiple courts have held, this type of voter registration assistance is “exactly” what the \nNVRA “pre-litigation notice was meant to encourage.” Scott, 771 F.3d at 836 (citation omitted). \nPlaintiffs concede that Defendants attempted to verify the voter registration status and \nupdate the voter registration information of each Plaintiff. See Exs. A, B, C (Requests for \nAdmission #9). Yet, Plaintiffs continue to claim standing based on the allegation that the parties \nhave  a  larger  disagreement  about  what  the  NVRA  requires,  which  Plaintiffs  claim  affects \nthousands of non-parties. Doc. 9, p. 20. But this argument conflicts with Fifth Circuit’s analysis in \nScott, where the state’s issuance of a voter registration form in response to an individual’s \npurported claim was exactly the type of action that would correct a violation under the notice \n                                                 \n6 Although for the reasons explained herein, those issues were not the result of violations of the NVRA in any event. \n14 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 82   Filed 07/18/17   Page 15 of 25\nprovision, despite the fact that it arose in the context of a larger dispute about the NVRA’s \nrequirements. 771 F.3d at 836. And Plaintiffs have not brought this suit through an organization \nthat has standing to assert claims on behalf of others. As a result, under Scott, Plaintiffs’ contention \nthat other voters will be affected by the State’s interpretation of the NVRA under State law is \ninsufficient to confer statutory standing. If an individual plaintiff does not have standing under the \nnotice provision to seek relief for himself, “he is not entitled to seek relief for others, either.” Id.  \nAccordingly, Plaintiffs’ claims lack standing under the NVRA’s notice provision.  \nB.  Plaintiffs lack Article III standing. \nPlaintiffs also cannot establish the Court’s subject-matter jurisdiction because they cannot \nestablish standing under Article III of the United States Constitution. To establish Article III \nstanding, a plaintiff must show: (1) an injury-in-fact; (2) that is traceable to the defendant’s \nchallenged conduct (causation); and (3) that is likely to be redressed by a favorable decision in the \ndistrict court (redressability). Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Envtl. Servs., Inc., 528 U.S. \n167, 180–81 (2000); see also Tex. Democratic Party v. Benkiser, 459 F.3d 582, 585–86 (5th Cir. \n2006). These elements are “an indispensable part of the plaintiff’s case.” Lujan v. Defs. of Wildlife, \n504 U.S. 555, 561 (1992). The party seeking to invoke federal jurisdiction bears the burden of \nestablishing all three elements. Id. If a party lacks standing to bring a claim, the court lacks subject-\nmatter jurisdiction over that claim. See Crane v. Johnson, 783 F.3d 244, 251 (5th Cir. 2015). Here, \nthe Plaintiffs lack standing because they have established neither causation nor redressability. \n1.  Plaintiffs’ injuries are not fairly traceable to any Defendant’s conduct, but are \ninstead the result of their own behavior. \n \nHere it is undisputed that no Plaintiff submitted a written, signed request to update his voter \nregistration information when changing the address on his Texas driver license using Texas.gov, \nas asserted in the Complaint. As a result, the alleged injuries related to their voter registration status \n15 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 82   Filed 07/18/17   Page 16 of 25\nor their rights under the NVRA—which requires covered voter registration applications to conform \nto applicable state law—is traceable not to Defendants’ conduct, but rather to their own inaction. \nAs a result, Plaintiffs’ alleged injuries do not satisfy the causation element necessary to establish \nArticle III standing. See Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560 (for an injury-in-fact to be fairly traceable to the \nchallenged action of the defendant, “there must be a causal connection between the injury and the \nconduct complained of.”); Westfall v. Miller, 77 F.3d 868, 871-73 (5th Cir. 1996) (injury stemming \nfrom plaintiff’s own inaction severs causal link between that injury and any conduct of defendant). \n2.  Plaintiffs’ claims are moot. \nFurther, Plaintiffs claims are moot. Mootness is “the doctrine of standing in a time frame.” \nCtr. for Individual Freedom v. Carmouche, 449 F.3d 655, 661 (5th Cir. 2006). If the controversy \nbetween a plaintiff and defendant has been “resolved to the point that they no longer qualify as \nadverse parties with sufficient legal interests to maintain the litigation,” a court lacks jurisdiction. \nStauffer v. Gearhart, 741 F.3d 574, 582 (5th Cir. 2014). That is, “[t]he requisite personal interest \nthat must exist at the commencement of litigation (standing) must continue throughout its existence \n(mootness).”United States Parole Comm’n v. Geraghty, 445 U.S. 388, 397 (1980). Federal courts \n“have no power under Article III to decide the merits of a case that is moot when it comes before” \nthem. Goldin v. Bartholow, 166 F.3d 710, 718 (5th Cir. 1999). A “controversy becomes moot \nwhere, as a result of intervening circumstances, there are no longer adverse parties with sufficient \nlegal interests to maintain the litigation.” Perschall v. Louisiana, 174 F.3d 197 (5th Cir. 1999) \n(citation omitted).  \nHere, it is undisputed that Plaintiffs are currently registered to vote at their desired \naddresses, and intend to make future updates to their voter registration in accordance with Texas \nlaw. As a result, their claims are moot and not capable of repetition. \n16 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 82   Filed 07/18/17   Page 17 of 25\ni.  There is no current controversy with any Plaintiff, because it is undisputed \nthat each is currently registered to vote at his desired address.  \n \nPlaintiffs’ deposition testimony establishes that each is currently registered to vote at his \ndesired address. Further, while Plaintiffs contend that their voter registration status has affected \ntheir ability to vote in previous elections, those elections have passed.  Dep’t of Tex., Veterans of \nForeign Wars v. Tex. Lottery Comm’n, 760 F.3d 427, 432 (5th Cir. 2014) (For an injury to be \nredressable, a plaintiff must show that a favorable decision would likely remedy it). In addition, in \nresponse to Plaintiffs’ pre-suit notice, Defendants offered assistance to Plaintiffs and worked to \nprovide information to allow  for the correction the alleged violations as to the specific parties and \nPlaintiffs were able to, and in fact did, cast a ballot in the 2016 federal election. See Exs. A, B, C, \nI. In fact, each Plaintiff was registered at his desired address during or prior to the notice period.  \nStringer Depo. 48:2-7; Woods Depo. 72:22-74:11; Hernandez Depo. 39:4-9; Ex. I. As a result, \nPlaintiffs lack the personal interest in this suit required to establish a case or controversy. \nii.  Because there is no competent evidence these Plaintiffs’ alleged injury will \nrecur, the capable-of-repetition exception to mootness is inapplicable.   \n \nA moot case may still be justiciable, if the underlying dispute is “capable of repetition, yet \nevading review.” Spencer v. Kemna, 523 U.S. 1, 17-18 (1998) (citations omitted).  This exception \napplies “only in exceptional situations.” Id. In the absence of a class action, a controversy is \ncapable of repetition, yet evading review where both of the following two requirements are met: \n“(1) the challenged action [is] in its duration too short to be fully litigated prior to its cessation or \nexpiration, and (2) there [is] a reasonable expectation that the same complaining party [will] be \nsubjected to the same action again.” Weinstein v. Bradford, 423 U.S. 147, 149 (1975) (per curiam). \n Here, there is no reasonable expectation that any Plaintiff will suffer any injury alleged \nhere in the future. Indeed, each Plaintiff testified that in the future, if he had to change addresses, \n17 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 82   Filed 07/18/17   Page 18 of 25\nhe planned to update his voter registration by submitting a signed, written request to do so. \nHernandez Depo. 39:10-15; Stringer Depo. 49:1-9; Woods Depo. 74:12-75:7. And this is precisely \nwhat Texas law requires. See, e.g., Tex. Elec. Code § 13.002(b); Tex. Elec. Code § 20.066; Tex. \nElec. Code §15.021.  \nAccordingly, whether Plaintiffs’ claims fall under the capable-of-repetition exception to \nmootness  depends  upon  how  the  Court  applies  the  “same  complaining  party”  requirement. \nDefendants note that this issue presents the Court with a cluttered canvas. 7 In election cases, the \nFifth Circuit has required that the same complaining party have a reasonable expectation that they \nwill face the same injury again. See Smith v. Winter, 782 F.2d 508, 510 (5th Cir. 1986) (election \nlaw challenge held moot because elected officials prevailed in recall election at ballot box). In \ncertain circumstances it has expanded the complaining party requirement to encompass likely \ninjuries to non-parties. See Ctr. For Individual Freedom v. Carmouche, 449 F.3d 655, 662 (5th \nCir. 2006); Kucinich v. Tex. Democratic Party, 563 F.3d 161, 164 (5th Cir. 2009). That said, \nWinter, as the earliest of the cited Fifth Circuit decisions, controls and requires the dismissal of \nPlaintiffs’ suit on standing grounds. See, e.g., Rios v. City of Del Rio, Tex., 444 F.3d 417, 425 n.8 \n(5th Cir. 2006) (stating rule of orderliness). \n                                                 \n7 Like the Fifth Circuit, other courts have also struggled to reconcile the Supreme Court’s capable-of-repetition \ninstructions in election cases. For example, the Second Circuit in Van Wie v. Pataki, 267 F.3d 109, 114 (2d Cir. 2001), \nnoted the “tension” in Supreme Court election cases applying the second prong of the capable-of-repetition exception. \n267 F.3d 109, 114 (2d Cir. 2001) (comparing Norman v. Reed, 502 U.S. 279, 288 (1992) (examining whether the \n“same parties” would face similar, future injury); Ill. State Bd. of Elections v. Socialist Workers Party, 440 U.S. 173, \n187-88 (1979); with Storer v. Brown, 415 U.S. 724, 737 n.8 (1974) (finding that the case was not moot post-election \nchallenge to state law regarding candidate eligibility was not moot because challenged law's \"effects on independent \ncandidacies[] will persist as [they] are applied in future elections.\"); Rosario v. Rockefeller, 410 U.S. 752, 756 n.5 \n(1973); Dunn v. Blumstein, 405 U.S. 330, 333 n.2 (1972)).  \n \nUltimately, the Second Circuit “adopted” approach of the Supreme Court’s election cases that hold “that, in the \nabsence of a class action, there must be a reasonable expectation that the same complaining party would encounter the \nchallenged action in the future.” Van Wie, 267 F.3d at 114 (emphasis in original). In light of the same cases, and the \nFifth Circuit’s decision in Smith v. Winter, 782 F.2d 508, 510 (5th Cir. 1986), Defendants would urge the Court to \nadopt the same approach here and focus the second prong solely the likelihood of the same injury on the same \ncomplaining parties.  \n18 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 82   Filed 07/18/17   Page 19 of 25\nIn Winter, the plaintiffs were elected officials who were subjected to recall elections under \nMississippi law. 782 F.2d at 509. They alleged the defendants’ actions and a state statute violated \nthe Voting Rights Act and their constitutional rights. Id. The plaintiffs ultimately prevailed in their \nelections before the case was decided. Id. at 510. As a result, the court found that their claims were \nproperly dismissed as moot. Id. In examining whether plaintiffs met the second prong of the \ncapable-of-repetition exception to mootness, the Fifth Circuit focused solely on whether the same \nplaintiffs established whether they would be subjected to the same action again, and held that the \n“second prong does not apply because there is no allegation or showing otherwise that [the \nplaintiffs] will be subjected to another recall petition.” Id.  To the extent Winter conflicts with any \nsubsequent panel’s decision, Winter’s analysis should control under Fifth Circuit precedent, and \nrequires dismissal of Plaintiffs’ claims in this case for lack of Article III standing.  \nIII.  Plaintiffs’ Claims Fail on the Merits. \n \nPlaintiffs’ NVRA and equal protection claims also fail on their merits, as they ignore or \nmisunderstand key provisions of both federal and state law. First, the NVRA provisions at issue \nincorporate Texas law by requiring that driver license applications and changes of address covered \nunder the Act must also comply with applicable state law. 52 U.S.C. §§20504(a)(1), 20504(d) the \nNVRA further requires that such applications be signed. Id. §20504(c)(2)(C)(iii). Texas law also \nrequires a voter registration application to be signed. TEX. ELEC. CODE §13.002(b), and only \nprovides for the transmission of an electronic signature when there is also an accompanying \nphysical signature, and in the case of DPS, only for in-person or by mail applications.  See TEX. \nELEC. CODE §§ 20.063; 20.066.  Texas law also requires out-of-county changes of address to be in \nwriting and signed.  TEX. ELEC. CODE § 15.021.  But, driver license’s renewal or change of address \ntransactions done online are not physically signed. As a result, in an online transaction, Texas law \n19 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 82   Filed 07/18/17   Page 20 of 25\nthat requires a driver license applicant who also wishes to register to vote sign and submit a voter \nregistration application. \nSince the relevant section of the NVRA requires the application to be completed in \naccordance with state law, compliance with Texas law is part and parcel of the NVRA. Further, to \nthe extent that any Plaintiff’s NVRA claim is based on an injury in a non-federal election, it fails \na matter of law because the NVRA is limited to challenges by voters harmed in the context of a \nfederal election.  Finally, Plaintiffs’ equal protection claim also fails because they have not—and \ncannot—identify  any  Texas  residents  who  filled  out  a  driver’s  license  change  of  address \napplication online, and were treated differently by the State.  \nA.  Plaintiffs’ NVRA claims fail as a matter of law. \n \n1.  Plaintiffs’  cannot  establish  a  violation  of  the  NVRA  because  the  signature \nrequirement at issue is within the State’s prerogative under the Election Clause \nand do not violate the NVRA. \n \nAs explained above, Texas law requires that voter registration applications “must be in \nwriting and signed by the applicant.” TEX. ELEC. CODE § 13.002(b); Schonhoff Depo. 102:20-21. \nThe same is true of out of county address changes. TEX. ELEC. CODE §15.021. In compliance with \nthe NVRA, Texas provides a voter registration application as part of an application for a motor \nvehicle driver’s license when a voter indicates that he or she wishes to register to vote. For in-\nperson or mail driver license applications, an applicant physically signs the application. Ingram \nDepo. 99:7-99:24; Schonhoff Depo. 123:24-124:5; 119:19-120:15.  \nIn the context of these types of applications, and these types of applications only, Texas \nlaw provides that the applicant may consent to the use of his electronic signature for purposes of \nsubmitting a voter registration application. See TEX. ELEC. CODE §§ 20.063, 20.066. But, unlike \nan in-person or by mail driver license application, an online applicant does not physically—or \n20 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 82   Filed 07/18/17   Page 21 of 25\nelectronically—sign a renewal or change of address driver license application. Ingram Depo. \n99:25-100:3; see also TEX. ELEC. CODE §§ 20.063; 20.066 (applying only to in person and by mail \ntransactions, and referring to consent that an electronic signature be transmitted); Ingram Depo. \n97:4-98:5; Schonhoff  Depo. 49:10-14. \nAs a result, to comply with §§13.002 and 15.021 of the Texas Election Code, online driver \nlicense transactions in which an applicant wants to register to vote are linked to a voter registration \napplication that the applicant has the opportunity to sign and submit. These procedures are \nconsistent both with the relevant State statutes, and the NVRA. See 52 U.S.C. §§20504(c)(2)(B) \n(State’s voter registration application may include information needed to “enable State election \nofficials to assess the eligibility of the applicant and to administer voter registration and other parts \nof  the  election  process.);  20504(c)(2)(C)(iii)  (application  must  require  the  signature  of  the \napplicant,  under  penalty  of  perjury);  20504(c)(2)(A)  (applications  may  require  a  “second \nsignature”); TEX. ELEC. CODE §§13.002, 15.021, 20.063, 20.066.  \nNevertheless,  Plaintiffs  claim  that  the  NVRA  required  Texas  to  update  their  voter \nregistration information “simultaneously” with their online requests to change the addresses on \ntheir driver licenses, and further claim that Texas violated the law by requiring them to submit a \nphysical signature when requesting a change to their voter registration information. Doc. 1, ¶¶2, \n26, 39.8  Plaintiffs erroneously claim that “the exact same information is submitted online” as is \nsubmitted by an individual updating or renewing their driver license in person, notwithstanding \nthe clear difference that an individual updating or renewing in person (or for that matter, by mail) \n                                                 \n8 Notably, no Plaintiff has claimed he attempted to renew a a Texas driver license online in \nconnection with the allegations in this case. See Doc. 1, ¶¶46-49. Thus, Defendants re-urge and \nincorporate by reference the arguments raised in their Motion to Dismiss, that the Court lacks \njurisdiction to consider online driver license renewals under the NVRA. Doc. 7. \n21 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 82   Filed 07/18/17   Page 22 of 25\nis providing a physical signature at that time. See Doc. 1 ¶ 43. And they make this claim despite \nthe fact that §20504 explicitly does not apply if the “applicant fails to sign the voter registration \napplication” as is undisputedly the case here. 52 U.S.C. §20504(a)(1).  \n Plaintiffs  would  further  have  states  treat  all  “driver’s  license  change-of-address \ntransactions as updates for voter registration purposes,” even where the applicant “states on the \nform that the change of address is not for voter registration purposes.” Compare Doc. 1, Count III \n(capitalization altered) with 52 U.S.C. §20504(d). The NVRA imposes no such requirement. Scott, \n771 F.3d at 831-40 (Louisiana did not violate the NVRA by informing applicant in NVRA-covered \ntransaction that, if they answered “no” to voter registration question, they would not be registered \nto vote, even where Louisiana did not provide voter registration application to applicants who \nanswered “no”). \nAccordingly, judgment as a matter of law is warranted on Plaintiffs’ NVRA claim. \n2.  Plaintiffs’ claims fail to the extent they do not establish an injury connected to a \nfederal election. \n \nPlaintiffs’ NVRA claims should also be dismissed to the extent they are not premised on \nviolations made in the context of a federal election. In particular, Woods should be dismissed from \nthe suit because he has not suffered the type of injury that can maintain a claim under the NVRA. \nRather, the NVRA by its own “terms applies to voters registrations for ‘elections for Federal \noffice.’” 52 U.S.C. §20504(a)(1)(emphasis added). Conversely, the federal statute does not apply \nto state or local elections as the authority to regulate federal elections “does not give Congress the \npower to directly regulate state voter registration procedures in state elections or state ballot \nissues.” Dobrovolny v. Nebraska, 100 F. Supp. 2d 1012, 1028 (D. Neb. 2000). Here, Woods’s \nclaims fail as a matter of law because he cannot show that the alleged violation impacted his \nparticipation in a federal election. \n22 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 82   Filed 07/18/17   Page 23 of 25\nNotably, this is not the first time a court has dismissed allegations that online driver license \ntransactions in Texas violate 52 U.S.C. §20504. Both Judge Rosenthal and the Fifth Circuit \nconsidered this issue in Broyles. There, the plaintiffs alleged the State violated the NVRA when \none of the plaintiffs “changed his driver’s license and updated his voter registration on the DPS \nwebsite” in 2007 but did not receive an updated voter registration card and therefore was not \neligible to vote in a 2008 local election. Broyles, 618 F. Supp. 2d at 678. Judge Rosenthal noted \nthat the NVRA claim failed because plaintiffs did not timely provide pre-suit notice, divesting \nthem of standing to maintain a private right of action. Id. at 691 (“If notice was optional, the 90-\nday cure period would be superfluous.”). The court also held that the NVRA is limited to the \ncontext of a federal election. Id. And, because the alleged delay and failure to update the Broyles \nvoter’s registration information was only alleged to have affected a local election, there was no \nviable “cause of action under the NVRA.” Id. This was so despite the allegation that the voter \nregistration information was not updated at the same time the voter completed changed his driver \nlicense information online. Id. The Fifth Circuit affirmed, and specifically held the district court \nwas correct to conclude that the plaintiffs did not state a claim under the NVRA. Broyles, 381 Fed. \nApp’x at 373. \nAt minimum, Broyles compels dismissal of Woods’s claims. Woods’ entire case rests on \nan alleged attempt to vote on “Election Day 2015,” after he moved from West Virginia to Houston \na few months earlier. Doc. 1, ¶ 49. But Woods admits that he did not attempt to cast a ballot in a \n2015 federal election. Ex. C (Request for Admission # 15). Thus, the NVRA is not implicated. \nTo the extent Hernandez or Stringer alleges a non-mooted NVRA claim based—not on \ntheir voting registration status—but an alleged statutory right to “simultaneous” voter registration, \nBroyles makes clear that this is insufficient to maintain a claim under the NVRA, absent connection \n23 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 82   Filed 07/18/17   Page 24 of 25\nto a federal election. Here, it is undisputed that each Plaintiff was able to cast a ballot in the 2016 \nfederal general election, and is currently registered at his current address. \nAs a result, judgment as a matter of law is warranted on all of Plaintiffs’ NVRA claims. \nB.  Plaintiffs’ equal protection claim fails as a matter of law. \nPlaintiffs’ equal protection claims have no more merit than those under the NVRA. \nCritically, to establish an equal protection claim, a plaintiff must establish that a similarly-situated \ncomparator was treated differently. City of Cleburne, Tex. v. Cleburne Living Ctr., 473 U.S. 432, \n439 (1985). In this circuit, the term “similarly-situated” is a “stringent standard” that is defined \nnarrowly  and  requires  the  comparator  to  be  treated  more  favorably  in  “nearly  identical” \ncircumstances. Hockman v. Westward Comm., LLC, 282 F.Supp.2d 512, 527–28 (E.D. Tex. 2003); \nWheeler v. BL Dev. Corp., 415 F.3d 399, 405 (5th Cir. 2005).  \nPlaintiffs are Texas voters who changed the addresses on their Texas driver licenses online, \nbut did not complete the portion of the application that would update their voter registration \ninformation. Plaintiffs’ constitutional claims fail as a matter of law because there is no allegation—\nmuch less admissible evidence—that other voters who completed the same online transaction were \ntreated differently by Defendants. See Baranowski v. Hart, 486 F.3d 112, 123 (5th Cir. 2007) (As \na prerequisite to an equal protection claim, “the plaintiff must prove that similarly situated \nindividuals were treated differently.”). Instead, the law at issue is facially neutral to all similarly-\nsituated applicants. See Vill. of Arlington Heights v. Metro. Hous. Dev. Corp., 429 U.S. 252, 264-\n66 (1977) (holding that an equal protection claim premised on an outwardly neutral law requires \nproof of both a discriminatory effect and a discriminatory purpose). These undisputed facts defeat \nPlaintiffs’ equal protection claims as a matter of law.  \n \n24 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 82   Filed 07/18/17   Page 25 of 25\nConclusion \n \nThe Court should dismiss all of Plaintiffs’ claims with prejudice. \nRespectfully submitted, \n \nKEN PAXTON \nAttorney General of Texas \n \nJEFFREY C.

McCRAW,  in  his  official  § \ncapacity  as  the  Director  of  the  Texas  § \nDepartment of Public Safety,  § \n  § \n                                  Defendants  § \n \nPLAINTIFFS’ REPLY IN SUPPORT OF  \nPLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \n  In their Response to Plaintiffs’ Motion for Summary Judgment (“Response”) Defendants \nassert, remarkably, that this case concerns their violation of Texas election laws—which they \nconfusingly also claim “Plaintiffs do not challenge”—during Defendants’ administration of the \nNVRA.1 In the pages that follow, it’s unclear whether Defendants are genuinely confused about \nthe nature of this case or actively trying to mislead the Court. In any event, as this Court has \nalready recognized, this case concerns Texas’s violations of the NVRA, not the state’s election \nlaws, and to the extent that Texas’s election laws conflict with the NVRA, state law must yield to \ncontrolling  federal  authority.2  For  the  reasons  included  in  Plaintiffs’  Motion  for  Summary \nJudgment (“MSJ”), in Plaintiffs’ Response in Opposition to Defendants’ MSJ, and herein, the \nCourt should grant Plaintiffs’ MSJ and require Defendants to comply with the NVRA without \n                                                 \n1 Dkt. 86 at 1-2. \n2 Dkt. 85 at 14. \n1 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 87   Filed 08/04/17   Page 2 of 10\nfurther delay.3 \nARGUMENT \nI.  All three Plaintiffs have validly invoked the NVRA’s abrogation of states’ \nsovereign immunity. \nFollowing an extraneous discussion of Ex parte Young, Defendants acknowledge that it \ndoes not apply here because the plain language of the NVRA contains a private cause of action.4 \nBased on that plain language of the NVRA, the Fifth Circuit and other federal courts have \nconfirmed that Congress intended for individuals be able to sue under the NVRA. ACORN v. \nFowler,  178  F.3d  350,  364  (5th  Cir.  1999).  Here,  Plaintiffs  satisfied  the  pre-suit  notice \nrequirements of the NVRA and Defendants subsquently failed to cure the violation,5 thereby \nabrogating immunity under the statutory scheme prescribed by Congress.6  \nDefendants (once again) also argue that they are immune from suit by virtue of belatedly \nattempting to assist Plaintiffs in registering to vote after originally failing to do so with their \nNVRA-covered online driver’s license transactions. But, Defendants (once again) overlook the \ncontinuing  violation  of  Plaintiffs’  statutory  right  to  “[s]imultaneous  application  for  voter \n                                                 \n3 Plaintiffs fully incorporate herein their Response in Opposition to Defendants’ MSJ, Dkt. 85. \n4 Dkt. 86 at 5-6. (1). At 52 U.S.C. § 20510(b), the NVRA states: A person who is aggrieved by a \nviolation of this chapter may provide written notice of the violation to the chief election official \nof the State involved. . . If the violation is not corrected within 90 days after receipt of a notice \nunder paragraph (1), or within 20 days after receipt of the notice if the violation occurred within \n120 days before the date of an election for Federal office, the aggrieved person may bring a civil \naction in an appropriate district court for declaratory or injunctive relief with respect to the \nviolation. \n5 Dkt. 77 at 4. Defendants again argue that Dr. Woods does not have standing because the first \nelection to occur after Defendants failed to update his voter registration information after an \nNVRA-covered transaction, was a state, rather than federal, election. Plaintiffs fully briefed this \nargument, explaining in detail why it is incorrect, in their Response. Dkt. 85 at 2-4. \n6 Plaintiffs also satisfy the Ex parte Young doctrine, as they have alleged “an ongoing violation \nof federal law and seek[] relief properly characterized as prospective.” Fish v. Kobach, 189 F. \nSupp. 3d 1107, 1125 (D. Kan.) (quoting Va. Office for Protection & Advocacy v. Stewart, 563 \nU.S.  247,  255  (2011)), aff'd, No.  16-3147,  2016  WL  5791539  (10th  Cir.  Sept.  30,  2016), \nand aff'd, 840 F.3d 710 (10th Cir. 2016).  \n2 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 87   Filed 08/04/17   Page 3 of 10\nregistration and … driver’s license” that this Court identified in its Order Denying Defendants’ \nMotion to Dismiss.7 Because Defendants have still not corrected this violation of the NVRA, \nPlaintiffs have statutory standing to pursue declaratory and injunctive relief under the plain terms \nof the statute.  \nII.  Plaintiffs have Article III standing to challenge Defendants’ failures to provide \nsimultaneous  voter  registration  application  for  online  change-of-address  and \nrenewals.  \n \nAs they did in their Motion to Dismiss (“MTD”), Defendants argue this Court should \nonly  grant  relief  with  respect  to  online  driver’s  license  change-of-address  transactions,  not \nrenewals. But, as the Court has recognized, Defendants provide one online system for both \nchanges of address and renewals, and Plaintiffs would not have received a different result had \nthey renewed their driver’s license at the same time or instead of changing their address.8 \nAccordingly, this Court can and should grant Plaintiffs’ MSJ with respect to both online driver’s \nlicense change-of-address and renewal transactions.  \nWith respect to Defendants’ other standing arguments, to avoid duplicative briefing, \nPlaintiffs fully incorporate their Response in Opposition to Defendants’ MSJ wherein Plaintiffs \ndemonstrate that they each possess Article III standing.9 \nIII.   As the record demonstrates, Defendants’ failure to treat online driver’s license \ntransactions as voter registration applications violates the NVRA.10  \n \nA.  Plaintiffs’ online driver’s license change-of-address  forms were submitted to \nDPS in accordance with the relevant state laws, and they did not state that their \ndriver’s  license  change-of-address  forms  were  not  for  voter  registration \npurposes. \n                                                 \n7 Dkt. 52 at 12. \n8 Dkt. 52 at 7. \n9 Dkt. 85 at 7-13. \n10 Defendants’ remaining NVRA arguments are wrong for the reasons provided in Plaintiffs’ \nprior briefing in response to the State’s MTD, in Plaintiffs’ MSJ, and in Plaintiffs’ Response in \nOpposition to Defendants’ MSJ. Dkts. 9, 77, and 85, and in the interest of brevity, Plaintiffs do \nnot further address them here. \n3 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 87   Filed 08/04/17   Page 4 of 10\n \nIn their Response, Defendants persist in their “circular and self-defeating reading of the \nNVRA[,]”11 once more claiming that the NVRA’s change-of-address provision applies only \nwhere the driver’s license change-of-address form is submitted in accordance with their reading \nof Texas’s voter registration laws, as opposed to the laws governing driver’s license change-of-\naddress transactions.12 For the reasons articulated by the Court in its Order denying Defendants’ \nMTD13  and  argued  by  Plaintiffs  in  their  Response  in  Opposition  to  Defendants’  MSJ,14 \nDefendants are wrong.  \nThe Fifth Circuit’s holding in Scott v. Schedler does not compel a different result. In \nScott, the court construed 52 U.S.C. § 20506(a)(6)(A)—which requires that public assistance \nagencies provide voter registration forms to applicants for public assistance unless they decline \nto  register  to  vote  in  writing—with  §  20506(a)(6)(B)(iii)—which  explicitly  mandates  that \napplicants be advised that failure to check “yes” or “no” in response to the application’s voter \nregistration question constitutes a declination to register to vote. 771 F.3d 831, 840 (5th Cir. \n2014). In this context, the court held that Louisiana did not violate the NVRA in failing to \nprovide voter registration forms to public assistance applicants who failed to check “yes” or “no” \nas provided by § 20506(a)(6)(B)(iii), because failing to check either box constitutes a declination \nto register to vote under § 20506(a)(6)(A). Id.  \nIn the Scott case, Louisiana’s form tracked with the NVRA-required language for public \nassistance forms and gave applicants a clear choice between registering to vote and declining to \ndo so. Here, however, Defendants refuse to treat online changes of address as notifications of \nchange of address for voter registration no matter whether the applicant selects “yes”—as each \n                                                 \n11 Dkt. 52 at 15. \n12 Dkt. 86 at 14. \n13 Dkt. 52 at 15. \n14 Dkt. 85 at 13-16. \n4 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 87   Filed 08/04/17   Page 5 of 10\nPlaintiff here did—or “no” to the prompt “I want to register to vote.” That is, in contrast to the \nchoice provided to applicants in Scott, here under no circumstance does a change-of-address \nform submitted online to DPS serve as a notification of an address change for voter registration. \nThis is a plain violation of the NVRA, and Plaintiffs are therefore entitled to judgment as a \nmatter of law on Count III of their Complaint.  \nB.  In order to register to vote, Texas requires DPS customers to provide SOS with \ninformation duplicative of the information they provided to DPS during their \nonline driver’s license transactions. \n \n  As set out fully in Plaintiffs’ MSJ, SOS requires that voter registration applicants provide \nat least six (and sometimes nine) of the same data points driver’s license customers provide to \nDPS  during  their  online  change-of-address  and  combined  change-of-address  and  renewal \napplications, and require two duplicative data points for online renewals.15 Defendants claim, \nhowever, that the state may require this duplicative information if it is the minimum amount \nnecessary under 52 U.S.C. § 20504(c)(2)(B).16 This argument conflates the NVRA’s prohibition \non requiring duplicative information with its mandate that states only collect the minimum \namount of information necessary. Indeed, the plain language of the pertinent section of the \nNVRA states that “[t]he voter registration application portion of the application for a State motor \nvehicle driver’s license (A) may not require any information that duplicates information required \nin the driver’s license portion of the form (other than a second signature or other information \nnecessary  under  subparagraph  (C)).”17  The  subparagraph  referenced  by  Defendants  is \nsubparagraph B, which is not an exception to the prohibition against requiring duplicative \ninformation.18 Texas’s requirement that online DPS customers provide duplicative information \n                                                 \n15 Dkt. 77 at 9-10.  \n16 Dkt. 86 at 16-17. \n17 52 U.S.C. 20504(c)(2)(A). \n18 52 U.S.C. § 20504(c)(2)(B). \n5 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 87   Filed 08/04/17   Page 6 of 10\nfor voter registration after submitting the exact same information during an online transaction is \na clear violation of section 20504(c)(2)(A) of the NVRA.  \nC.  Defendants already import customer data points and electronic signatures for \nvoter registration applications originating from in-person and mail-in change-of-\naddress  driver’s  license  transactions  and  should  do  the  same  for  online \ntransactions.  \n \n  Defendants again attempt to confuse the issue by stating that they are not required to \ntransmit  voter  registration  information  submitted  during  online  driver’s  license  transactions \nbecause  Texas  law  requires  that  voter  registration  forms  be  in  writing  and  signed  by  the \napplicant.19 This argument blatantly and misleadingly ignores the fact that in-person and mail-in \nchange-of-address DPS customers do not actually fill out or sign what the State uses as their \nvoter registration form. Rather, as the process currently works, relevant data points (including the \ncustomer’s electronic signature) are pulled from the DPS database, sent to the SOS’s database, \nand used to populate a voter registration form the DPS customer never sees, fills out, or signs.20 \nThis is exactly the system that, pursuant to the NVRA, Defendants could and should utilize for \nonline driver’s license transactions. \nVI.  Defendants violate the Equal Protection Clause as to DPS customers who choose \nto engage in driver’s license transactions online. \nIn their Response to Plaintiffs’ MSJ, Defendants fail again to consider, analyze, or even \nacknowledge the Anderson-Burdick test, despite the Supreme Court, the Fifth Circuit, and this \nCourt recognizing its applicability to  Equal Protection claims involving the right to vote.21 \n                                                 \n19 Dkt. 86 at 17-18. \n20 See Dkt. 77-1, Appx. 98 (Ex. 13, SOS’s Suppl. Resps. to Jarrod Stringer’s First RFAs, No. \n13); Dkt. 77-1, Appx. 43 (Ex. 6, Ingram 30(b)(6) Dep. 173:9-10); Dkt. 77-1, Appx. 110 (Ex. 14, \nExcerpt from Secretary of State’s 32nd Annual Election Law Seminar, Voter Registration 102 \npresentation,  P003060,  Voter  Registration  Presentation,  slide  14,  P003982  at  P003995) \n(produced  to  Plaintiffs  as  Bates  number  D_00008318-8354,  which  Defendants  marked  as \n“confidential” and so Plaintiffs did not attach to their MSJ). \n21 Dkt. 86, at 19-20; Dkt. 52, at 20-21. \n6 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 87   Filed 08/04/17   Page 7 of 10\nCrawford v. Marion Cty. Election, 553 U.S. 181, 190-191 (2008); Kucinich v. Texas Democratic \nParty, 563 F.3d 161, 168 n.6 (5th Cir. 2009). Ignoring the proper test, Defendants rely instead \nupon inapposite Equal Protection cases to claim that “[u]nless a plaintiff identifies a comparator \nwho is similarly situated in all relevant respects, but was treated differently, he cannot recover \nunder  the  Equal  Protection  Clause.”22  As  explained  in  detail  in  Plaintiff’s  Response  to \nDefendants’  MSJ,  however,  because  the  Anderson-Burdick  test  controls,  Plaintiffs  are  not \nrequired to identify a “comparator who is similarly situated . . . but was treated differently.”23 \nInstead, Defendants must identify a legitimate interest sufficiently weighty to justify the burden \nthey impose on Texans’ right to vote. See Northeast Ohio Coal. for the Homeless v. Husted, 837 \nF.3d 612, 633 (6th Cir. 2016) (applying the Anderson-Burdick standard to nondiscriminatory \nrestriction, and holding that the restriction violated the Equal Protection Clause, in part, because \nOhio failed to explain “why its interest in preventing voter fraud by mail makes it ‘necessary to \nburden’ the plaintiffs’ voting rights”), cert. denied, 2017 WL 881266 (U.S. June 19, 2017). \nBecause they have repeatedly failed to do so,24 Plaintiffs are entitled to judgment as a matter of \nlaw on their Equal Protection claims. \nV.   The Court should impose the remedies requested in Plaintiffs’ MSJ. \n  Defendants  argue  that  Plaintiffs  request  an  overly-broad  “catch-all”  injunction. \nDefendants, again, are wrong. In their MSJ, as in their Complaint, Plaintiffs ask the Court to \ndeclare  that  Defendants  violate  the  NVRA  “by  failing  to  provide  for  simultaneous  voter \n                                                 \n22 Dkt. 86, at 19.  \n23 Dkt. 85, at 16-17; Dkt. 86, at 19. \n24  Defendants  imply  that  the  handwritten  signature  requirement  is  necessary  because  it  is \nrequired by Texas law and allows “counties to fulfill their obligation to maintain copies of voter \nregistration applications of all active voters.” Dkt. 86, at 3, 20. Defendants’ argument that Texas \nlaw requires a handwritten signature is fundamentally flawed, since they do not even use a \nhandwritten signature for other DPS based voter registration applicants. See supra Part III. Thus, \nthis basis is insufficiently weighty to justify the burden imposed. \n7 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 87   Filed 08/04/17   Page 8 of 10\nregistration with online driver’s license renewal. . . [and] online change-of-address forms” and to \nenjoin them from “implementing practices and procedures that likewise violate the NVRA[.]”25  \nIn other words, Plaintiffs request that the Court enter  an injunction that would specifically \nprohibit Defendants from violating the sections of the NVRA at issue in this case. Defendants’ \nargument—that a  yet-to-be-ordered injunction would be overbroad  and vague—makes little \nsense. Of course, Plaintiffs request the Court order an injunction that is sufficiently specific to \ncomply with Fed. R. Civ. Pro 65. \nDefendants also claim that because they will comply with any injunction ordered by this \nCourt, reporting and monitoring is unwarranted until such time that they demonstrate refusal to \ncomply. This is a bold statement, given the State’s refusal to comply with the NVRA for years, \ndespite actual knowledge of thousands of voters’ complaints, and its bad faith conduct in this \nlitigation, resulting in sanctions from this Court. Moreover, monitoring is a common mechanism \nto ensure NVRA compliance. Indeed, as discussed in United States v. Louisiana, a case cited \nfavorably by Defendants, \nWhere a state or its subordinate agencies openly and plainly refuse to \ncomply with the NVRA, such monitoring may be proper. Indeed, other \nplaintiffs  have  requested  it,  and  other  courts  have  recognized  this \nparticular’s  remedy  special  value  to  securing  the  NVRA’s  aims. \nHistorically, when NVRA violations have been suitably proven, as they \nhave been here, courts have not hesitated to compel states to submit plans \nfor full and prompt compliance.26 \n \nSo too here, Defendants have openly and stubbornly refused to treat any online driver’s license \ntransactions as voter registration applications. Thus, if the Court determines, as it has before and \n                                                 \n25 Complaint, Dkt. 1 at 17-18 and Dkt. 77 at 25 (emphasis added). \n26 196 F. Supp. 3d 612, 676 (M.D. La. July 26, 2016) (internal quotations and citations omitted). \nThe court in Louisiana declined to order monitoring not, as Defendants contend, because it was \ninappropriate, but because the extent of the NVRA violations was not ascertainable without a \ntrial. Id. at 676-677. Here, for the reasons articulated in Plaintiffs’ MSJ and their briefing in \nresponse to Defendants’ MSJ, the extent of Defendants’ NVRA violations is clear on the record \nbefore the Court, and trial is not necessary. \n8 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 87   Filed 08/04/17   Page 9 of 10\nas  it  should  again,  that  Texas’s  policies  violate  the  NVRA,  an  injunction  combined  with \nmonitoring and reporting requirements are warranted and necessary. \nCONCLUSION \nPlaintiffs have demonstrated in their MSJ, in their Response in Opposition to Defendants’ \nMSJ, and herein that Defendants violated the NVRA and continue to do so with respect to online \ndriver’s  license  transactions  in  Texas.  The  Court  should  grant  Plaintiffs’  MSJ  and  deny \nDefendants’ MSJ, declaring Defendants in violation of the NVRA’s mandates with respect to \nthese transactions, enjoin them from continued violations of the relevant NVRA provisions at \nissue here, and require them to report to the Court under an appropriate monitoring plan to \nensure compliance with the injunction. \n \nDated: August 4, 2017.

SA-16-CV-257-OG \n  §     \nROLANDO PABLOS, et al.,  § \n  § \nDefendants.  §   \n_____________________________________  § \n  § \nJARROD STRINGER, et al.,  §   \n  § \nPlaintiffs,  § \n  § \nv.  §  CIVIL NO. SA-20-CV-46-OG \n  §     \nRUTH HUGHS, et al.,  § \n  § \nDefendants.  §   \n______________________________________________________________________________ \n \n \nDEFENDANTS’ OPPOSITION TO PLAINTIFFS’ \nEMERGENCY APPLICATION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION AND \nREQUEST FOR HEARING \n______________________________________________________________________________ \n \nAny eligible Texan who wishes to vote in the upcoming election still has ample time to \nregister,  and  this  Court’s  refusal  to  enter  an  unmerited  preliminary  injunction  will  not \ndisenfranchise any voter. Contrary to what Plaintiffs would have the Court believe, the right to \nvote in Texas does not depend on this Court’s entry of an extraordinarily onerous and unnecessary \npreliminary injunction against Defendants. The sole question before this Court is whether Plaintiffs \nhave carried their heavy burden of proving their entitlement to “emergency” relief. The answer is \nthat they have not. \nThis litigation is not a continuation of the 2016 claims by Plaintiff Stringer. Those claims \n1 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 36   Filed 01/27/20   Page 2 of 23\nwere dismissed due to a lack of subject matter jurisdiction, and the parties’ positions on the merits \nwere never adjudicated by the appellate court. As this Court has already recognized, the litigation \nmust “begin anew” because there are new claims, brought by new parties, and due process requires \nthat Defendants are given a full and fair opportunity to defend themselves against this new lawsuit. \nInstead, Plaintiffs would prefer to shortcut the judicial process. They would have this Court grant \nthem an unwarranted victory at the outset rather than test the merits of their claims in the normal \ncourse of litigation.  \nTo invoke such an exceptional use of this Court’s authority, Plaintiffs must meet an \nexceptionally high burden, and they have failed to do so. First, Plaintiffs cannot demonstrate that \nthey will suffer irreparable harm absent an “emergency” intervention by this Court. They have \nunjustifiably delayed in bringing their claims, and every eligible individual is readily capable of \nprotecting their own right to vote without intervention by the Court. Second, Plaintiffs cannot show \nthat the entry of a preliminary injunction would serve the public interest or outweigh the harm \ndone to the State of Texas by a sweeping injunction on the eve of an election. Third, Plaintiffs’ \nsuccess on the merits cannot be assumed. And fourth, Plaintiffs’ proposed injunction is improper \nand insufficient, as this Court has already recognized. \nFor  these  reasons,  the  Court  should  deny  Plaintiffs’  emergency  application  for  a \npreliminary injunction and allow the parties to litigate this case in the normal course.1 \n                                                 \n1 Defendants respectfully submit this opposition as ordered by the Court, but they do so with a full \nreservation of rights, without waiving and subject to their objections to the Court’s jurisdiction and \nto the improper consolidation of Stringer v. Pablos (Stringer I), CIVIL NO. SA-16-CV-257-OG, \nand Stringer v. Hughs (Stringer II), CIVIL NO. SA-20-CV-46-OG, as explained in their motion \nto sever. Likewise, Defendants have waived service of the complaint and summons in Stringer II \nand will timely file their responsive pleading. Defendants reserve all arguments and all grounds \nfor dismissal under Rule 12(b) for their responsive pleading, including but not limited to lack of \njurisdiction (due to a lack of standing, failure to comply with NVRA notice provisions, or any \nother reason) and failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. \n2 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 36   Filed 01/27/20   Page 3 of 23\nBACKGROUND \nI.  The National Voter Registration Act \nThe U.S. Constitution guarantees to the States the right to choose the time, place, and \nmanner of elections, absent federal law to the contrary. U.S. Const. art. I, § 4, cl. 1. Acting pursuant \nto this authority, Congress passed the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA) in 1993. 52 U.S.C. \n§§ 20501-11. The NVRA was intended to increase the number of citizens eligible to vote while \nprotecting the integrity of the electoral process. Id. § 20501(b).  \nThe NVRA provides that “each State shall establish procedures to register to vote in \nelections for Federal office . . . by application made simultaneously with an application for a motor \nvehicle driver’s license pursuant to section 20504 of this title.” Id. § 20503(a). Section 20504 \ndescribes, in detail, when States are required to treat driver’s-license transactions as voter-\nregistration  transactions.  Under  §  20504(a)(1),  “[e]ach  State  motor  vehicle  driver’s  license \napplication (including any renewal application) submitted to the appropriate State motor vehicle \nauthority under State law shall serve as an application for voter registration with respect to \nelections for Federal office unless the applicant fails to sign the voter registration application.” \n(emphasis added). Relatedly, § 20504(c) generally prohibits States from requiring duplicate \ninformation  on  the  voter-registration  portion  of  a  driver’s-license  application.  Subsection \n(c)(2)(C)(iii)  does,  however,  provide  that  “[t]he  voter-registration  application  portion  of  an \napplication for a State motor vehicle driver’s license . . . shall include a statement that . . . requires \nthe signature of the applicant, under penalty of perjury.” (emphasis added). When a driver \nchanges the address on his driver’s license, § 20504(d) provides that the change-of-address form \n“shall serve as notification of change of address for voter registration with respect to elections for \nFederal office for the registrant involved unless the registrant states on the form that the change of \n3 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 36   Filed 01/27/20   Page 4 of 23\naddress is not for voter registration purposes.” \nThe NVRA is enforceable by the U.S. Attorney General, id. § 20510(a), but it also creates \na private right of action for individuals “aggrieved” by violations of the NVRA. An aggrieved \nperson must first provide written notice of the violation to the chief election official of the State. \nId. § 20510(b)(1). The State then has 90 days to correct the violation, or 20 days if the violation \noccurs within 120 days of an upcoming federal election. Id. § 20510(b)(2). If the violation is not \ncorrected, the aggrieved person may bring a civil action for declaratory or injunctive relief “with \nrespect to the violation.” Id. \nII.  Texas Law \nThe Texas Legislature has adopted detailed statutes governing voter registration. Crucially, \n“[a] registration application must be in writing and signed by the applicant.” Tex. Elec. Code \n§ 13.002(b); see also id. § 65.056(a) (allowing the affidavit on a provisional ballot to serve as a \nvoter-registration application if it contains the necessary information). Likewise, any change to \nvoter-registration information must also be in writing and signed. Id. § 15.021(a). \nThe only exception to the signature requirement is when a voter moves within a single \ncounty. In that case, Texas law permits the voter to change his voter-registration address online. \nSee Tex. Elec. Code § 15.021(d). If, however, the voter moves between counties, he must fill out \na voter-registration form, sign it, and submit it to the voter registrar of his new county of \nregistration. See id. § 15.021(a). This is because Texas uses a county-based voter-registration \nsystem, where the sole and exclusive authority to accept or reject voter registrations rests with each \ncounty’s voter registrar. See Tex. Elec. Code §§ 12.001, 13.071.  \nIn accordance with the NVRA, Texas has integrated its driver’s-license transactions with \nits voter-registration transactions with respect to paper applications. Paper applications for driver’s \n4 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 36   Filed 01/27/20   Page 5 of 23\nlicenses,  renewal  of  driver’s  licenses,  and  changes  of  address  on  driver  licenses  all  allow \nindividuals to choose whether they want to register to vote or change their address, and all paper \napplications require a signature. See Tex. Elec Code § 20.062. DPS also electronically captures \nthe handwritten signature of each applicant, and that image is sent to the Secretary of State for \nvoter-registration  purposes  pursuant  to  specific  statutory  authorization.  See  id.  §  20.066(a). \nHowever, with respect to online renewal of driver licenses and online changes of addresses with \nDPS, individuals log in to the DPS website from their homes, and no signature is collected at the \ntime of that transaction. Voters who wish to register to vote or change their voting address are \nprovided a link to a voter registration form.  \nII.  Stringer v. Pablos (Stringer I), Civil No. SA-16-CV-257-OG \nOn March 14, 2016, Plaintiff Stringer and other individuals brought claims under the \nNVRA  and  the  Equal  Protection  clause  challenging  the  State’s  system  of  managing  voter \nregistration information in the context of these online DPS transactions. See Stringer I, Compl. \n[ECF No 1]. No plaintiff sought a preliminary injunction or temporary restraining order, and after \nthe normal course of litigation, including extensive discovery, this Court ruled in favor of plaintiffs \non cross-motions for summary judgment. See, e.g., id., March 30, 2018 Order [ECF No. 103]. The \nCourt entered a final judgment on May 18, 2018. See id., Final Judgment [ECF No. 109]. \nDefendants sought an emergency stay of the final judgment in Stringer I from both this \nCourt and the Fifth Circuit, and on May 31, 2018, the Fifth Circuit granted the motion, preventing \nthe injunction from taking effect. See Stringer I, May 31, 2018 Order [ECF No. 118]. On \nNovember 13, 2019, the Fifth Circuit ruled that none of the plaintiffs had proven the essential \nprerequisites of standing, and therefore concluded that the Court had been without jurisdiction to \nenter its order. Stringer v. Whitley, 942 F.3d 715 (5th Cir. 2019) [ECF No. 122]. The Fifth Circuit \n5 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 36   Filed 01/27/20   Page 6 of 23\ndid not reach the merits of the plaintiffs’ claims, and it remanded the case to this Court “with \ninstructions to dismiss Plaintiffs’ claims for lack of standing.” Id. at 725. \nAfter remand, the Texas Democratic Party, DCCC, and DSCC filed a motion to intervene \ninto Stringer I, which Defendants opposed. See Stringer I, ECF Nos. 124, 133, 134. \nIII.  Stringer v. Hughs (Stringer II), Civil Action No. SA-20-CV-46-OG \nOn December 19, 2019, Plaintiffs sent what purports to be an NVRA notice letter to \nDefendant Hughs regarding the same DPS online voter registration procedure that was at issue in \nStringer I. See Stringer II, Compl. Ex. B [ECF Nos. 1-3]. On January 14, 2020, Plaintiffs filed \ntheir complaint alleging NVRA and Equal Protection violations. See Stringer II, Compl. [ECF No. \n1]. Plaintiff Stringer was a party to the Stringer I litigation. Accompanying him in Stringer II are \ntwo new Individual Plaintiffs and two Organizational Plaintiffs, MOVE Texas Civic Fund (MOVE \nTexas) and the League of Women Voters of Texas (LWVTX). See id. ¶¶ 18-22. Defendants have \nwaived service of summons and of the complaint and will timely file a responsive pleading on or \nbefore March 16, 2020. \nOn January 17, 2020, after business hours on the eve of a holiday weekend, Plaintiffs filed \ntheir motion for preliminary injunction. See Stringer II, Mot. [ECF No. 5]. Plaintiffs’ request \nenvisions systemic changes to Defendants’ voter-registration practices, via a federal injunction \noverriding Texas state law, prior to the February 3, 2020 deadline for voters to register in time to \nparticipate in the upcoming primary election on March 3, 2020. See, e.g., id. at 6. \nOn January 21, 2020, the Court took the following actions: (1) sua sponte consolidated \nStringer II into Stringer I and directed the parties to file all pleadings into the consolidated case \n[ECF No. 135]; (2) granted the Intervenor-Plaintiffs’ motion to intervene into Stringer I, and \nentered the complaint in intervention onto the docket [ECF Nos. 136, 137]; (3) set a preliminary \n6 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 36   Filed 01/27/20   Page 7 of 23\ninjunction hearing for January 28, 2020, at 1:30 PM [ECF No. 138]; (4) dismissed all of the original \nplaintiffs’ claims in Stringer I [ECF No. 139]; and (5) ordered Defendants to file a written response \nto Plaintiffs’ motion on or before January 27, 2020, at 1:30 P.M. [ECF No. 140]. \nOn the afternoon of January 24, 2020, the Court entered a three-page order directing the \nparties to prepare responses to at least sixteen (16) factual and legal questions (including subparts) \nfor presentation to the Court at the preliminary injunction hearing. See ECF No. 141. \nSTANDARD OF LAW \n “A preliminary injunction is an extraordinary remedy.” Miss. Power & Light Co. v. United \nGas Pipe Line Co., 760 F.2d 618, 621 (5th Cir. 1985). This is particularly true when a party seeks \nan order directing state officials to perform or discontinue certain conduct. Morrow v. Harwell, \n768 F.2d 619, 627 (5th Cir. 1985). The decision to grant a preliminary injunction is to be treated \nas “the exception rather than the rule.”2 Texas v. Seatrain Int’l, S.A., 518 F.2d 175, 179 (5th Cir. \n1975); Canal Auth. of the State of Fla. v. Callaway, 489 F.2d 567, 576 (5th Cir. 1974). \nA party seeking a preliminary injunction must show: “(1) a substantial likelihood of success \non the merits; (2) a substantial threat that plaintiffs will suffer irreparable injury if the injunction \nis not granted; (3) that the threatened injury outweighs any damage that the injunction might cause \nthe defendant; and (4) that the injunction will not disserve the public interest.” Planned Parenthood \nof Hous. & Se. Tex. v. Sanchez, 403 F.3d 324, 329 (5th Cir. 2005). An injunction should not be \ngranted unless the movant “has clearly carried the burden of persuasion on all four requirements.” \nPlanned Parenthood Ass’n of Hidalgo Cnty., Tex., Inc. v. Suehs, 692 F.3d 343, 348 (5th Cir. 2012).  \n“In considering whether to grant or deny preliminary injunctive relief, the district court \n                                                 \n2 Legal determinations made at the preliminary injunction stage are subject to plenary review on \nappeal. Griffin v. Box, 910 F.2d 255, 259 (5th Cir. 1990). \n7 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 36   Filed 01/27/20   Page 8 of 23\n‘must remember that a preliminary injunction is an extraordinary and drastic remedy,’ and that \n‘[t]he movant has a heavy burden of persuading the district court that all four elements are \nsatisfied.’” Enterprise Int’l, Inc. v. Corporacion Estatal Petrolera Ecuatoriana, 762 F.2d 464, 472 \n(5th Cir. 1985) (alteration in original) (footnotes omitted) (quoting Callaway, 489 F.2d at 573, and \nHardin v. Hous. Chronicle Publ’g Co., 572 F.2d 1106, 1107 (5th Cir. 1978)). “Thus, if the movant \ndoes not succeed in carrying its burden on any one of the four prerequisites, a preliminary \ninjunction may not issue and, if issued, will be vacated on appeal.” Id. (citing Clements Wire & \nMfg. Co. v. NLRB, 589 F.2d 894, 897 (5th Cir. 1979)).  \nAdditionally, considerations of federalism weigh heavily against interference by federal \ncourts through the issuance of preliminary injunctions against state agencies. Parrott v. Livingston, \nNo. 15-866, 2016 WL 4487918, at *1 (E.D. Tex. June 29, 2016); accord Gibson v. Leblanc, No. \n16-354, 2016 WL 5796897, at *2 (M.D. La. Sept. 30, 2016). “‘[E]specially where governmental \naction is involved, courts should not intervene unless the need for equitable relief is clear, not \nremote or speculative.’” Machete Prods., L.L.C. v. Page, 809 F.3d 281, 288 (5th Cir. 2015) \n(quoting Eccles v. Peoples Bank, 333 U.S. 426, 431 (1948)). \nMoreover, while a typical preliminary injunction seeks simply to maintain the status quo \npending a resolution on the merits of the case, here Plaintiffs seek to force Defendants to act. See, \ne.g., Stringer II, Pls.’ Proposed Order at 1 [ECF No. 5-2] (asking the Court to direct “Defendants \nto take all appropriate measures”). Mandatory injunctions are “particularly disfavored,” and \nPlaintiffs must sustain an even higher burden. Roark v. Individuals of the Fed. Bureau of Prisons, \nFormer and Current, 558 F. App’x 471, 472 (5th Cir. 2014) (quoting Martinez v. Matthews, 544 \nF.2d 1233, 1243 (5th Cir. 1976)); accord Exhibitors Poster Exchange, Inc. v. Nat’l Screen Serv. \nCorp., 441 F.2d 560, 561-62 (5th Cir. 1971); Miami Beach Fed. Sav. & Loan Ass’n v. Callander, \n8 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 36   Filed 01/27/20   Page 9 of 23\n256 F.2d 410, 415 (5th Cir. 1958). A mandatory preliminary injunction “should not be granted \nexcept in rare instances in which the facts and law are clearly in favor of the moving party.” Miami \nBeach Fed. Sav. & Loan, 256 F.2d at 415; accord Tate v. Am. Tugs, Inc., 634 F.2d 869, 870 (5th \nCir. 1981) (“‘Only in rare instances is the issuance of  a mandatory  preliminary injunction \nproper.’”) (quoting Harris, 596 F.2d at 679); Travelers Cas. v. Padron, No. 15-200, 2016 WL \n1064650, at *7 (W.D. Tex. Mar. 14, 2016); Serna v. Tex. Dep’t of State Health Servs., No. 15-446, \n2015 WL 10818655, at *11 (W.D. Tex. Oct. 16, 2015); Saucedo v. Enders, No. 03-433, 2004 WL \n911309, at *2 (W.D. Tex. Apr. 16, 2004).  \nARGUMENT \nPlaintiffs cannot sustain the “heavy burden” that they face under typical preliminary \ninjunction  standards,  much  less  the  heightened  “rare  instances”  showing  required  for  the \nmandatory relief that they seek. Accordingly, the Court should deny the requested mandatory \npreliminary injunction. \nI.  Plaintiffs Have Failed to Demonstrate Irreparable Harm. \nPlaintiffs simultaneously assert that they are seeking to change a State process that has \nbeen in place for years and that they need “emergency” relief. But their substantial delay in \nbringing their motion for a preliminary injunction undermines the urgency of their request. \nMoreover, any eligible voter who wants to vote in the upcoming March election may do so by \nregistering with their local election officials via any of the methods available to them. Accordingly, \nit is simply untrue that Plaintiffs’ alleged harm is entirely unavoidable absent extraordinary relief \nfrom this Court, and Plaintiffs’ motion should therefore be denied. \nA.  Plaintiffs’ Delay in Bringing Their “Emergency” Motion is Fatal to \nTheir Allegation of Irreparable Injury. \n \nPlaintiffs repeatedly assert and admit that the alleged problems of which they complain \n9 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 36   Filed 01/27/20   Page 10 of 23\nhave been in place for years, claiming that the State has been on notice of these alleged violations \nsince at least 2013, and certainly by 2015. See, e.g., Mot. at 8, 11; Stringer I, Compl. Ex. C (May \n27, 2015 notice letter from Plaintiffs’ counsel). Throughout their motion, Plaintiffs contend that \nDefendants have been out of compliance with the NVRA “[f]or far too long.” Id. at 6; see also id. \nat 11 (“Texas has known for years that its online driver’s license practices disenfranchise large \nnumbers of voters.”). Despite the allegedly long-standing nature of the Defendants’ conduct, \nPlaintiffs have brought to this Court an “emergency” motion. But the “emergency” is of Plaintiffs’ \nown making, not a result of Defendants’ actions. \nPlaintiffs’ substantial delay of many years in bringing their “emergency” motion precludes \na finding of irreparable injury. Kensington Partners v. Cordillera Ranch, Ltd., No. 98-121, 1998 \nWL 1782540, at *11 (W.D. Tex. June 16, 1998) (“Delay in bringing suit may preclude a finding \nof irreparable injury, which would then preclude the granting of preliminary injunctive relief.”). \n“The law is well-established that . . . [d]elay in seeking a remedy is an important factor bearing on \nthe need for a preliminary injunction. Absent a good explanation, a substantial period of delay \nmilitates against the issuance of a preliminary injunction by demonstrating that there is no apparent \nurgency to the request for injunctive relief.”  GoNannies, Inc. v. GoAuPair, Inc., 464 F. Supp. 2d \n603, 609 (N.D. Tex. 2006); see also High Tech Med. Instrumentation, Inc. v. New Image Indus., \n49 F.3d 1551, 1557 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (“[D]elay in seeking a remedy is an important factor bearing \non the need for a preliminary injunction.”). Unjustified delay on its own is sufficient to “preclude \nthe granting of preliminary injunctive relief, because the failure to act sooner undercuts the sense \nof urgency that ordinarily accompanies a motion for preliminary relief and suggests that there is, \nin fact, no irreparable injury.” Tough Traveler, Ltd. v. Outbound Prods., 60 F.3d 964, 968 (2d Cir. \n1995) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted); see also Rimkus Consulting Grp., Inc. v. \n10 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 36   Filed 01/27/20   Page 11 of 23\nCammarata, 255 F.R.D. 417, 438 (S.D. Tex. 2008). Here, Plaintiffs’ years of delay establish that \nthere is no urgency for the Court to enter the vague and systemic relief that they seek, and therefore, \nthere is no irreparable injury.  \nCourts have found that substantially shorter periods of delay have undone the urgency that \nis required to justify granting preliminary injunctive relief. See, e.g., Boire v. Pilot Freight \nCarriers, Inc., 515 F.2d 1185, 1193 (5th Cir. 1975) (affirming denial of temporary mandatory \nrelief where the movant “waited three months before petitioning the district court for temporary \nrelief”); Marks Org., Inc. v. Joles, 784 F. Supp. 2d 322, 333 (S.D.N.Y. 2011) (“The Second Circuit \nhas found delays of ‘as little as ten weeks’ sufficient to defeat the presumption of irreparable \nharm.”) (quoting Weight Watchers Int’l v. Lugino’s, Inc., 423 F.3d 137, 145 (2d Cir. 2005)); \nGoNannies, 464 F. Supp. 2d at 609 (holding that an undue delay of six months between discovery \nof the injury and the filing of the motion was “sufficient to rebut any possible presumption of \nirreparable harm”).   \nThe  Organizational  Plaintiffs  in  particular  have  no  excuse  for  their  failure  to  seek \n“emergency” relief before now. MOVE Texas has been in existence since 2013,3 and it claims to \nengage in voter registration and get-out-the-vote activities throughout the State. See Stringer II, \nCompl. ¶ 21; Pls.’ Ex. 21, Decl. of Hilliard Drew Galloway ¶ 4. As part of its activities, MOVE \nTexas alleges that it trains and educates voters and staff regarding the process afforded by the DPS \nonline driver license system. See Pls.’ Ex. 21, Galloway Decl. ¶¶ 10-12. Accordingly, MOVE \nTexas cannot seriously contend that it has acted with the urgency consistent with a claim of \nirreparable harm. See also, e.g., Pls.’ Ex. 22, Decl. of Erica Elliott ¶ 7 (describing an incident \n                                                 \n3 See About, MOVE Texas, https://movetexas.org/about/ (last visited Jan. 24, 2020). \n \n11 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 36   Filed 01/27/20   Page 12 of 23\nduring the 2018 General Election regarding the DPS website). \nSimilarly, LWVTX has existed since 1919,4 long before the NVRA was enacted, and \nLWVTX alleges that it too “conducts voter education and get-out-the-vote efforts.” Stringer II, \nCompl. ¶ 22; see also Pls.’ Ex. 23, Decl. of Grace Chimene ¶¶ 6-9. LWVTX claims to “provide[] \npublic trainings which include cautioning voters about the fact that the DPS online driver’s license \nsystem does not register customers to vote.” Pls.’ Ex. 23, Chimene Decl. ¶ 12; see also Pls.’ Ex. \n28, Decl. of Sharon E. Walther (explaining interactions with voters who have used the DPS online \nsystem). Accordingly, as with MOVE Texas, LWVTX cannot contend that it acted urgently to \nbring its claims to this Court, because it has known about the operation of the Texas Election Code \nfor years without pursuing such claims. \nPlaintiffs can offer no “good explanation” for failing to bring their claims earlier, see \nGoNannies, 464 F. Supp. 2d at 609, and the “emergency” they allege has nothing to do with any \nrecent action by the State. Rather, Plaintiffs—and the Organizational Plaintiffs in particular—have \nelected to do nothing about the alleged harm for years. Plaintiffs’ failure to act urgently is fatal to \ntheir assertion of irreparable harm. \nB.  Any Harm that the Individual Plaintiffs Will Suffer Related to the \nMarch Election Will Be the Result of Their Own Inaction. \n \nPlaintiffs claim that a preliminary injunction is the only means by which they will be able \nto vindicate their rights and avoid disenfranchisement. See, e.g., Mot. at 35-36, 44. This is false. \nAny of the individual plaintiffs can register to vote with their local voter registrar in time to vote \nin the March election via several different methods. See, e.g., Where to Get an Application, \nVoteTexas.gov,  https://www.votetexas.gov/register-to-vote/where-to-get-an-application-2.html \n                                                 \n4 History, LWV, https://my.lwv.org/texas/history (last visited Jan. 24, 2020). \n12 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 36   Filed 01/27/20   Page 13 of 23\n(last visited Jan. 25, 2020). For example, voters can register in person at the county voter registrar’s \noffice; by mail, with either an application printed at home or picked up from “libraries, government \noffices, or high schools”; or by requesting a postage-paid application from the local voter registrar. \nSee id.; see also, e.g., “Secretary Hughs Reminds Texans To Register And Prepare To Vote,” \nTexas  Secretary  of  State,  https://www.sos.state.tx.us/about/newsreleases/2020/012320.shtml \n(January  23,  2020);  Register  to  Vote,  Bexar  County  TX  Elections  Department, \nhttps://www.bexar.org/1702/Register-to-Vote (last visited Jan. 25, 2020) (noting that applications \ncan be printed from the SOS website, that voters may “[c]all the Voter Registration office at 210-\n335-VOTE (8683) and request a voter registration application to be sent to you,” and that “[y]ou \ncan also find voter registration applications at libraries, government offices, or high schools to be \nfilled out, signed, and mailed”). Accordingly, there is ample opportunity for any eligible Texan to \nregister to vote in time to participate in the March election.5 \nPlaintiffs’ alleged harm is not irreparable because it is entirely within their control whether \nthey  will  be  registered  to  vote  for  the  March  election.  Each  of  the  alleged  roadblocks  to \nregistration—such as Plaintiff Gomez’s alleged lack of a home printer, see Mot. at 36—can be \nsurmounted by means other than the extraordinary relief of a federal mandatory injunction against \nagencies of the sovereign State of Texas. Indeed, SOS regularly aids voters seeking to register to \nvote, and those resources are available to the Plaintiffs. See, e.g., Register to Vote, VoteTexas.gov, \nhttps://www.votetexas.gov/register-to-vote/index.html (last visited Jan. 25, 2020). Accordingly, \nwith many other avenues available to ensure that Plaintiffs may register to vote in time for the \n                                                 \n5 Whether the Individual Plaintiffs should have to use one of these methods to register themselves \nto vote is a question for the merits of the dispute. Defendants contend that the State process is \nlawful,  but  that  question  has  no  bearing  on  the  narrow  issue  of  whether  Plaintiffs  have \ndemonstrated an irreparable injury sufficient to justify the entry of a mandatory preliminary \ninjunction by this Court. \n13 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 36   Filed 01/27/20   Page 14 of 23\nMarch election, it cannot be said that Plaintiffs face a substantial threat of irreparable harm “if the \ninjunction is not granted.” Sanchez, 403 F.3d at 329. Without such a showing, Plaintiffs’ motion \nmust fail. \nII.  The Damage Done by Plaintiffs’ Requested Injunction Outweighs Any Alleged \nHarm, and Granting Plaintiffs’ Motion Will Disserve the Public Interest. \n \nPlaintiffs  have  failed  to  engage  in  an  adequate  analysis  of  the  potential  negative \nramifications of their requested injunction, arguing instead that there can be no harm to Defendants \nbecause Plaintiffs will prevail on the merits, see Mot. at 42-44, and that the public interest will be \nserved by a preliminary injunction because it is Plaintiffs’ preferred policy outcome, see id. at 44-\n45.6 But the sweeping technological and procedural changes envisioned by Plaintiffs cannot be \naccomplished before the March election, and any attempt to do so would be fraught with the \npotential for technical errors, inconsistency, and uncertainty among the county voter registrars who \nmaintain the voter rolls throughout the State. \nIt is not possible for Defendants to implement the technical changes contemplated by \nPlaintiffs before the March election. As an initial matter, any changes to the DPS driver license \nrenewal website cannot be accomplished by either of the Defendants. The Texas Department of \nInformation Resources (DIR) is responsible for maintaining Texas.gov and working with the \nState’s vendors, and it would take DIR a minimum of 90 days to complete its work with respect to \nany changes. See Decl. of Jennifer Buass, attached hereto as Exhibit A. Likewise, DPS estimates \nthat its work in this regard could take at least 7-11 weeks and would require close coordination \nwith DIR. See Decl. of Sheri Gipson, attached hereto as Exhibit B. Furthermore, modifications to \n                                                 \n6 The two factors of “assessing the harm to the opposing party and weighing the public interest . . . \nmerge when the Government is the opposing party.” Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 435 (2009). \nAccordingly, it is appropriate for the Court to consider these factors together, as Defendants are \nofficials acting in their official capacities as agents of the State. \n14 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 36   Filed 01/27/20   Page 15 of 23\nDPS’s systems may also necessitate changes to SOS’s processes, which may take at least 60 days \nto prepare depending on the scope and complexity of the changes implemented by DIR and DPS. \nSee Decl. of Brian Keith Ingram, attached hereto as Exhibit C. Additionally, SOS could have to \nprovide additional training to county voter registrars, who have the sole authority to approve or \nreject voter registration applications. See id. Accordingly, Defendants cannot implement the kinds \nof changes Plaintiffs envision before the March election. \nPlaintiffs cite snippets of deposition testimony from Stringer I for the proposition that \nmaking changes to these processes is as simple and straightforward as flipping a few switches. \nSee, e.g., Mot. at 24-25; see also Mot. at 42 (dismissing the hardship to Defendants as “at most[] \nadministrative inconvenience”). But as Defendants successfully argued to the Fifth Circuit in \nseeking a stay of the Court’s final judgment in Stringer I, and as attested to here, the process of \nimplementing any changes to DPS’s online driver license system is one that requires care, \nplanning, forethought, and most importantly, time. Attempting to rush these processes in order to \nmeet Plaintiffs’ timeline, even if it were possible, would invite errors due to inadequate time to \nproperly code, review, and test any technical changes. The harm that may be done to the State’s \nvoter registration system could be substantial. \nPlaintiffs also fail to account for the uncertainty that would likely result from last-minute \nsweeping changes to the State’s voter registration system on the eve of an election. Plaintiffs \nassume that the public interest would be served by a preliminary injunction because it would be \ntheir preferred policy outcome. See Mot. at 45. But a systemic change in a process of registering \nvoters less than a week before the voter registration deadline for the March election could cause \nuncertainty among voters, who may not know whether their information from prior online driver \nlicense transactions had been successfully transmitted to their county voter registrar, as well as \n15 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 36   Filed 01/27/20   Page 16 of 23\nuncertainty among county voter registrars, who might be inundated with voluminous data during \nthe final week of voter registration. Furthermore, although Plaintiffs assert that complaints to DPS \n“about this issue will [] end,” id., they make no effort to explain how an eleventh-hour change in \nlong-standing voter registration procedures would do anything but raise more questions and \nuncertainty  for  the  public.  Simply  put,  Plaintiffs  have  failed  to  consider  the  full  range  of \nconsequences that could flow from their requested injunction, and therefore Plaintiffs have failed \nto demonstrate that the public interest would not be disserved by their proposed injunction. \nIn essence, Plaintiffs’ arguments regarding the factors of harm to Defendants and the public \ninterest are based on little more than their allegation that Defendants are violating the law, \neffectively collapsing these factors into the consideration of likelihood of success on the merits. \nSee id. at 42 (contending that any harm to Defendants is outweighed because “Defendants are \nactively engaging in the violation of federal law”); id. at 44 (asserting that the public interest factor \nis met because the requested injunction “requir[es] Defendant to follow Federal law”). But \nPlaintiffs cannot unilaterally absolve themselves of their burden as to any of the four factors that \nthis Court must consider. See Enterprise Int’l, 762 F.2d at 472 (stating that a preliminary injunction \nshould not issue if the applicant fails to carry its burden on “any one of the four prerequisites”); \nsee also Miss. Power & Light, 760 F.2d at 633 (“The public interest standard is a hurdle which \nmust be overcome before employing the drastic remedy of interim injunctive relief, not a clarion \ncall for action before reaching final judgment.”).  \nMoreover, the Court must keep in mind that Plaintiffs are requesting that the Court enjoin \nthe operation of duly enacted laws of the State of Texas. “When a statute is enjoined, the State \nnecessarily suffers the irreparable harm of denying the public interest in the enforcement of its \nlaws.” Planned Parenthood of Greater Tex. Surgical Health Servs. v. Abbott, 734 F.3d 406, 419 \n16 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 36   Filed 01/27/20   Page 17 of 23\n(5th Cir. 2013). “‘[A]ny time a State is enjoined by a court from effectuating statutes enacted by \nrepresentatives of its people, it suffers a form of irreparable injury.’” Maryland v. King, 133 S. Ct. \n1, 3 (2012) (quoting New Motor Vehicle Bd. of Cal. v. Orrin W. Fox Co., 434 U.S. 1345, 1351 \n(1977) (Rehnquist, J., in chambers)). This harm cannot be entirely discounted simply because \nPlaintiffs allege a constitutional violation, particularly because the parties and the Court have not \nhad the benefit of the Fifth Circuit’s opinion as to the voter registration practices at issue.  \nPlaintiffs have failed to sufficiently analyze the potential harm to Defendants from being \nordered to comply with an impossible injunction, and they have failed to account for the harm to \nthe public interest that could come from this Court’s imposition of systemic change on the eve of \nan election. Accordingly, Plaintiffs have failed to satisfy their burden with respect to each of these \nfactors, and their motion should be denied.  \nIII.  Plaintiffs Have Not Demonstrated a Substantial Likelihood of Success on the \nMerits. \n \nDefendants have not yet responded to Plaintiffs’ claims—they will do so in due course \nwith a motion to dismiss. As the Court has rightly recognized, this case “will begin anew with \nJarrod Stringer’s 2020 claims, as well as the new claims” of the other, new Plaintiffs. Order of \nDismissal at 1-2 [ECF No. 139] (emphasis added). Although the Court is familiar with some of \nthe facts and law relevant to this set of claims, they are new claims. For example, nothing is yet \nknown about any of the new Plaintiffs beyond what is alleged in their pleadings. Particularly in \nlight of the failure to prove standing in Stringer I, it should not be assumed that these Plaintiffs \nwill necessarily fare any better. Likewise, the Court should consider anew Defendants’ arguments \nthat the Texas Election Code is compliant with the NVRA, and that Plaintiffs have failed to state \na claim under the NVRA or the Equal Protection clause. The Fifth Circuit did not address the \nmerits of the lawsuit in Stringer I, and Defendants have a right to be heard on their substantive \n17 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 36   Filed 01/27/20   Page 18 of 23\narguments by this Court and, if necessary, on appeal. The Court’s views on the merits of the \nprevious litigation are not dispositive of the merits of this litigation, and Defendants do not concede \nanything that was decided against them by this Court in Stringer I. \nIn any event, even if the Court finds that Plaintiffs have met their heavy burden with respect \nto this factor, a substantial likelihood of success on the merits is only one of the showings that \nPlaintiffs must make in order to demonstrate their entitlement to the mandatory preliminary \ninjunction that they seek. Because Plaintiffs fail to meet their burden as to each of the other \nrequired showings, the Court should deny Plaintiffs’ motion. \nIV.  Plaintiffs’ Requested Injunction Is Improper and Insufficient. \nAs the Court has correctly recognized, Plaintiffs have utterly failed to specify the relief that \nthey are seeking. See Jan. 24, 2020 Order ¶ 6 [ECF No. 141] (“Plaintiffs must explain the scope \nof preliminary injunctive relief they are seeking and submit a proposed order setting out that \nrelief.”). Defendants are unduly prejudiced by Plaintiffs’ deficient proposed order and therefore \nhave not been afforded an opportunity to respond fully to Plaintiffs’ extraordinary request for \nemergency relief. Whatever explanation Plaintiffs offer to the Court at the January 28 hearing, \nDefendants will be hearing it for the first time, deprived of their right to know in advance what is \nbeing asked of them, and deprived of the process to which they are entitled in responding to \nPlaintiffs’ motion. Plaintiffs’ attempt to ambush Defendants should not be countenanced by the \nCourt. \nPlaintiffs’ failure to provide an adequate proposed order also constitutes independent \ngrounds for rejection of their motion, because even if Plaintiffs had carried their heavy burden to \nshow their entitlement to relief—which they have not—the injunction that they have requested \nfrom this Court is improper and insufficient. Rule 65(d)(1) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure \n18 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 36   Filed 01/27/20   Page 19 of 23\nrequires that “[e]very order granting an injunction and every restraining order must: (A) state the \nreasons why it issued; (B) state its terms specifically; and (C) describe in reasonable detail—and \nnot by referring to the complaint or other document—the act or acts restrained or required.” These \n“specificity provisions of Rule 65(d) are no mere technical requirements. The Rule was designed \nto prevent uncertainty and confusion on the part of those faced with injunctive orders, and to avoid \nthe possible founding of a contempt citation on a decree too vague to be understood.” Schmidt v. \nLessard, 414 U.S. 473, 476 (1974); (citing Int’l Longshoremen’s Ass’n, Local 1291 v. Philadelphia \nMarine Trade Ass’n, 389 U.S. 64, 74-76 (1967))7; accord Scott v. Schedler, 826 F.3d 207, 212 \n(5th Cir. 2016). “A general inunction which in essence orders a defendant to obey the law is not \npermitted.” Meyer v. Brown & Root Constr. Co., 661 F.2d 369, 373 (5th Cir. 1981); see also In re \nRodriguez, 695 F.3d 360, 369 (5th Cir. 2012) (“Injunctions are problematic when they order a \ndefendant to obey the law but do not simultaneously indicate what law the defendant needs to \nobey.”). \nCourts have denied other plaintiffs’ requests for injunctive relief because their proposed \ninjunctions failed to meet Rule 65(d)’s requirements. See, e.g., Randolph v. E. Baton Rouge Parish \nSch. Bd., No. 15-654, 2016 WL 3579224, at *3 (M.D. La. June 28, 2016) (rejecting a plaintiff’s \nrequest for injunctive relief in part because “[t]he request to enjoin Defendants from bullying, \nharassing, intimidating, or depriving administrators of due process is essentially an ‘obey the law’ \ninjunction” that “is improper” because “[t]hese words are too general  and vague”);  Epicor \nSoftware Corp. v. Alternative Tech. Solutions, Inc., No. 13-448, 2013 WL 12130254, at *3 (C.D. \nCal. May 20, 2013) (rejecting a plaintiff’s request for a TRO in part because the requested relief \n                                                 \n7 “The requirement of specificity in injunction orders performs a second important function. Unless \nthe trial court carefully frames its orders of injunctive relief, it is impossible for an appellate \ntribunal to know precisely what it is reviewing.” Schmidt, 414 U.S. at 477. \n19 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 36   Filed 01/27/20   Page 20 of 23\n“cannot be crafted with sufficient specificity to fairly notify the subjects of the order of what \nconduct it prohibits”); Versata Software, Inc. v.

Goldberg, 812 F. Supp. 403, 411 (S.D.N.Y. 1993) (denying a \npreliminary injunction in part because “[i]njunctions with the degree of vagueness and ambiguity \nof that requested by [the plaintiff] do not meet this [Rule 65(d)] standard and are inappropriate”); \nsee also In re Xerox Corp. ERISA Litig., 483 F. Supp. 2d 206, 221 (D. Conn. 2007) (dismissing a \nportion of the complaint’s prayer for relief because it failed to satisfy the requirements of Rule \n65(d)); Reinholdson v. Minnesota, No. Civ.011650(RHK/JMM), 2002 WL 32658480, at *4-5 (D. \nMinn. Nov. 21, 2002) (same). \nIn the absence of an adequate proposed order from Plaintiffs, Defendants can only respond \nto what they have been given: a wholly inadequate and unacceptably vague proposed injunction \nwith which Defendants could not possibly comply. First, Plaintiffs ask that the Court order \nDefendants “to take all appropriate measures necessary to remedy the harm caused by their \nnoncompliance with the [NVRA] and the U.S. Constitution”—without specifying what measures \nare appropriate or necessary, and without explaining which alleged harms are meant to be remedied \nby this injunction. See Pls.’ Prop. Order at 1 [ECF No. 5-2]. Though Plaintiffs also request that the \nCourt order Defendants to “provid[e] and accept[] simultaneous voter registration applications in \nelections for Federal office” from those who engage in specified online transactions with DPS, id., \n20 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 36   Filed 01/27/20   Page 21 of 23\nthis  request  is  both  nonsensical—voter  registration  applications  are  not  tied  to  particular \nelections—and impossible to comply with in the immediate timeframe suggested by Plaintiffs’ \nmotion (i.e., before the March election), as explained above. \nSecond, Plaintiffs ask this Court to enjoin “Defendants, and all those associated with them, \nfrom discriminating against, harassing, or interfering with” the alleged rights of “each Individual \nPlaintiff, affected members of Associational Plaintiff,8 and other eligible Texans.” Id. at 1-2. This \nis a vague and impermissible injunction which at most amounts to a directive to “follow the law,” \nfailing to meet the requirements of Rule 65(d). See Schmidt, 414 U.S. at 476. At least one court \nhas rejected substantially similar language for this reason. See, e.g., Randolph, 2016 WL 3579224, \nat *3 (rejecting a plaintiff’s request for injunctive relief in part because “[t]he request to enjoin \nDefendants from bullying, harassing, intimidating, or depriving administrators of due process is \nessentially an ‘obey the law’ injunction” that “is improper” because “[t]hese words are too general \nand vague”). This requested injunction simply does not adequately specify what it is that Plaintiffs \nseek, or what law Defendants are to refrain from violating, and therefore it fails to satisfy the \nspecificity requirements of Rule 65. \nFinally, Plaintiffs ask this Court to order Defendants “to register to vote or update voter \nregistration information for each Individual Plaintiff using their most recent online driver’s license \ntransaction.” Pls.’ Prop. Order at 2. Compliance with this request is impossible. Plaintiffs fail to \nacknowledge that neither DPS nor SOS has the ability to register any voter at all—Texas law gives \nthat authority solely to county voter registrars. See Tex. Elec. Code. §§ 12.001, 13.071; Ingram \nDecl. ¶ 8. Similarly, even if Defendants could determine the full extent of the changes that \nPlaintiffs are seeking, Plaintiffs ignore that the changes to state systems required by this injunction \n                                                 \n8 It is unclear from the proposed order which Plaintiff is referenced here. \n21 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 36   Filed 01/27/20   Page 22 of 23\ncannot be completed in the timeframe they suggest, as discussed above. Moreover, this proposed \ninjunction is not necessary to avoid an impact to the Individual Plaintiffs’ ability to vote in the \nMarch election, as there are several other means available to them if they wish to register vote. \nPlaintiffs’  proposed  injunction  is  improper  and  insufficient  as  a  matter  of  law  and \ncompliance would be impossible. This Court has already recognized that Plaintiffs’ submission \nwith their motion is inadequate. See Jan. 24, 2020 Order ¶ 6. Accordingly, even if Plaintiffs had \nproven that they are entitled to a mandatory preliminary injunction—which they have not—their \nrequested relief should still be denied. \nCONCLUSION \nPlaintiffs have failed to satisfy the “heavy burden” that they must meet in order to obtain a \npreliminary injunction, and they have fallen well short of the heightened “rare instances” showing \nrequired for the mandatory relief that they seek. Moreover, to the extent that Plaintiffs’ proposed \ninjunction has any content at all, Defendants could not possibly implement the systemic changes \nPlaintiffs envision before the March election. Accordingly, for the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs’ \nmotion for a preliminary injunction should be denied.   \n22 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 36   Filed 01/27/20   Page 23 of 23\nRespectfully submitted. \n \nKEN PAXTON \nAttorney General of Texas \n                                                                    \nJEFFREY C.

It’s Sara Schaumburg, S-A-R-A\n12 S-C-H-A-U-M-B-U-R-G.\n13      Q.   Thank you.\n14               My name is Anna Mackin.  I’m an attorney\n15 with the Texas AG’s Office, and I represent the\n16 Defendants in the case.  I’m going to be taking your\n17 deposition today.  Have you been deposed before?\n18      A.   Yes.\n19      Q.   Okay.  So you’re probably familiar with the\n20 basic ground rules, but I want to touch on a couple of\n21 high points before we get into the meat of the\n22 questions.  Since we are using this remote means, please\n23 try to give a verbal answer to my questions, a \"yes\" or\n24 a \"no,\" as opposed to \"uh-huh\" or \"huh-uh.\"  That’s\n25 because Debbie is writing down everything we say, and so\nIntegrity Legal Support Solutions\nwww.integrity-texas.com\n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 86   Filed 06/15/20   Page 8 of 150\nDSCC - 4/30/2020\n7\n1 that way we can get a clear and accurate record.  Okay?\n2      A.   Yes.\n3      Q.   Okay.  And please let me finish my question\n4 before you answer.  I will also endeavor to let you\n5 finish your answer before I ask my next question.\n6 Again, this is especially important that we avoid\n7 speaking over today to give the court reporter time to\n8 get everything down.\n9               If you don’t understand one of my\n10 questions, will you agree to tell me so that I can\n11 rephrase it?\n12      A.   Yes.\n13      Q.   Thank you.\n14               And this is not an endurance contest.\n15 You are the talent.  If you need a break to use the\n16 restroom, stretch your legs at any time, just let me\n17 know.  I’ll have you answer any question that is pending\n18 at the time; but then you can go ahead and take that\n19 break.  Okay?\n20               Any reason that you might not be able to\n21 answer my questions honestly, completely, and accurately\n22 today?\n23      A.   No.\n24      Q.   And now that the deposition is underway,\n25 please tell me if you communicate via text, e-mail, or\nIntegrity Legal Support Solutions\nwww.integrity-texas.com\n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 86   Filed 06/15/20   Page 9 of 150\nDSCC - 4/30/2020\n8\n1 any other means about [sic] your counsel about the\n2 substance of your testimony between now and when I\n3 conclude the deposition.  Okay?\n4      A.   Yes.\n5      Q.   Do you have any documents in front of you?\n6      A.   No.\n7      Q.   Okay.  I’m going to be showing you some\n8 documents today; but since we’re situated remotely, if\n9 you refer to any document or any website to aid you in\n10 answering my questions, please let me know that.  Okay?\n11      A.   And just to -- sorry.  I do have a hard copy\n12 of the Complaint.\n13      Q.   Okay.\n14      A.   And the -- and my declaration.\n15      Q.   Okay.  Thank you for that.\n16               Also during our conversation today, when\n17 I say DSCC, I will be referring to the Democratic\n18 Senatorial Campaign Committee; and when you say DSCC, I\n19 will also understand you to be referring to the\n20 Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.  Is that fair?\n21      A.   Yes.\n22      Q.   Okay.  So during today’s deposition, I’m going\n23 to be showing you some documents.  We can do this one of\n24 two ways.  I can share documents on my screen, or I can\n25 send a link in the chat box to allow you to click and\nIntegrity Legal Support Solutions\nwww.integrity-texas.com\n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 86   Filed 06/15/20   Page 10 of 150\nDSCC - 4/30/2020\n9\n1 download the document.  Do you have a preference?  Would\n2 one of those be easier for you?\n3      A.   Probably the link.\n4      Q.   Okay.  Let’s go ahead, then, and practice with\n5 what’s going to be Exhibit 1.\n6               (Exhibit 1 marked.)\n7      Q    (BY MS. MACKIN)  So I’m placing a document in\n8 the chat box.  Did that go through okay?\n9      A.   It did.\n10      Q.   Okay.  And if you wouldn’t mind opening that\n11 up, take a look at it and let me know when you are ready\n12 to discuss it.\n13      A.   Okay.\n14      Q.   Have you seen this document before,\n15 Ms. Schaumburg?\n16      A.   Yes.  My only hesitation is just the date is\n17 different than the one that I was familiar with.  I\n18 thought one -- I’m looking at one, so I’m just -- or the\n19 one that I have is from December.  This one is from\n20 January, but I think I am generally familiar with this\n21 document.\n22      Q.   Okay.  And what is it?\n23      A.   This is our Complaint in this case.\n24      Q.   Okay.  And did you review the document before\n25 it was filed?\nIntegrity Legal Support Solutions\nwww.integrity-texas.com\n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 86   Filed 06/15/20   Page 11 of 150\nDSCC - 4/30/2020\n10\n1      A.   Yes.\n2      Q.   Okay.  How much time would you say that DSCC\n3 staff spent reviewing this document before it was filed?\n4      A.   Personally, I probably spent about an hour or\n5 two looking over it before it was filed.  I can’t speak\n6 to others.\n7      Q.   Do you know if anyone else with DSCC reviewed\n8 it before it was filed?\n9      A.   I believe so, but I don’t know for sure.\n10      Q.   Okay.  That’s all that I have on that\n11 document.\n12               MS. MACKIN:  I’m going to share another\n13 document in the chat box.\n14               (Exhibit 2 marked.)\n15      Q.   (BY MS. MACKIN)  Please let me know if that’s\n16 come through okay, and let me know when you’re ready to\n17 discuss it.  And, obviously, take all the time you need\n18 to look it over.\n19      A.   Okay.\n20      Q.   All right.  Have you seen this document\n21 before?\n22      A.   Yes.\n23      Q.   And what is it?\n24      A.   This is the Notice of my deposition and the\n25 deposition topics.\nIntegrity Legal Support Solutions\nwww.integrity-texas.com\n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 86   Filed 06/15/20   Page 12 of 150\nDSCC - 4/30/2020\n11\n1      Q.   Okay.  And so you understand that you are here\n2 today pursuant to this Deposition Notice?\n3      A.   Yes.\n4      Q.   And you understand that this document says\n5 that DSCC is directed to designate one or more persons\n6 to testify on its behalf on the topics of this Notice?\n7      A.   Yes.\n8      Q.   And so do you understand that your testimony\n9 today is on behalf of DSCC, and your answers will bind\n10 DSCC?\n11      A.   Yes.\n12      Q.   Okay.  And, again, taking all the time you\n13 need to review the topics listed in the Notice, have you\n14 been designated as DSCC’s representative on each topic\n15 in Exhibit 2?\n16      A.   That’s my understanding, yes.\n17      Q.   Okay.  How did you prepare for today’s\n18 deposition?\n19               MS. BRAILEY:  I’m going to object on the\n20 attorney-client privilege.\n21               Sara, you can answer as long as you don’t\n22 reveal any conversation with me on that.\n23      A.   I’ve had two sessions with counsel.  I spoke\n24 with some other employees at the DSCC about our\n25 involvement in Texas, and I reviewed some of the filings\nIntegrity Legal Support Solutions\nwww.integrity-texas.com\n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 86   Filed 06/15/20   Page 13 of 150\nDSCC - 4/30/2020\n12\n1 in the case and the documents that the DSCC has produced\n2 in the case.\n3      Q.   Who did you meet with at DSCC to prepare for\n4 today’s deposition?\n5      A.   I spoke briefly with Allison Wright and Ben\n6 Walden.\n7      Q.   And what is Ms. Wright’s position with DSCC?\n8               MS. BRAILEY:  I’m going to object on the\n9 First Amendment to the extent that any of your answers\n10 would include strategic information.\n11               But you can answer at a high level.\n12      A.   She handles our compliance.\n13      Q.   (BY MS. MACKIN)  So, like, one of her job\n14 duties is filing your filings with the FEC, for example?\n15      A.   That, I don’t know.\n16      Q.   Oh, okay.  No problem.\n17               And then what is Mr. Walden’s role with\n18 DSCC?\n19               MS. BRAILEY:  The same objection.  I’m\n20 going to just object on the First Amendment.\n21               You can answer at a high level as long as\n22 you don’t reveal strategic information.\n23      A.   He’s the director of Candidate Services.\n24      Q.   (BY MS. MACKIN)  So did you meet with anyone\n25 else at DSCC to prepare for today’s deposition besides\nIntegrity Legal Support Solutions\nwww.integrity-texas.com\n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 86   Filed 06/15/20   Page 14 of 150\nDSCC - 4/30/2020\n13\n1 Ms. Wright and Mr. Walden?\n2      A.   No.\n3      Q.   Okay.  And why did you meet with Ms. Wright to\n4 prepare for today’s deposition?\n5      A.   To make sure I had a complete understanding of\n6 our investments and involvement in Texas in the Texas\n7 Senate race.\n8      Q.   And how about Mr. Walden, why did you meet\n9 with him?\n10      A.   I’m sorry.  I said for the same reason as\n11 Ms. Wright.\n12      Q.   Okay.  Thank you for that.\n13               And you mentioned that you met with your\n14 counsel twice?\n15      A.   Correct.\n16      Q.   Okay.  And, again, I’m not asking for the\n17 substance of those communications or what you discussed,\n18 nothing privileged, just kind of the nuts and bolts of\n19 how long were each of those meetings?\n20      A.   A couple of hours.\n21      Q.   All right.  And so are you adequately\n22 familiarized with the facts to testify as DSCC’s\n23 representative on the topics in the Notice?\n24      A.   Yes.\n25      Q.   Okay.  Did you review -- well, let’s see.  You\nIntegrity Legal Support Solutions\nwww.integrity-texas.com\n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 86   Filed 06/15/20   Page 15 of 150\nDSCC - 4/30/2020\n14\n1 mentioned that you reviewed the filings in this lawsuit,\n2 not all of them, some of them, and the documents that\n3 DSCC has produced to us.  Did you review any other\n4 documents to prepare for today’s deposition?\n5               MS. BRAILEY:  I’m just going to object to\n6 preserve the attorney-client privilege.\n7               You can answer as long as none of this\n8 involves our conversations.\n9      A.   No.\n10      Q    (BY MS. MACKIN)  So your counsel has provided\n11 some documents to us that are Bates numbered DSCC 1\n12 through DSCC 906.  Are you aware of that?\n13               MS. BRAILEY:  Objection.\n14               Anna, just so you know, it goes to 911 is\n15 the final Bates number.\n16               MS. MACKIN:  I apologize.  911.  I guess\n17 the last document is titled 906, but it’s several pages.\n18               MS. BRAILEY:  Right.\n19               MS. MACKIN:  I appreciate that.  Thank\n20 you, Emily.\n21      Q    (BY MS. MACKIN)  And so are you familiar with\n22 the fact that those documents have been provided to us,\n23 Ms. Schaumburg?\n24      A.   I understand that counsel produced this set of\n25 documents in advance of this.\nIntegrity Legal Support Solutions\nwww.integrity-texas.com\n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 86   Filed 06/15/20   Page 16 of 150\nDSCC - 4/30/2020\n15\n1      Q.   And is it your understanding that the\n2 documents were provided as DSCC’s response to the\n3 subpoena on page 6 of Exhibit 2?\n4      A.   Yes.\n5      Q.   Okay.\n6               MS. MACKIN:  And I’m going to attach a\n7 copy of that production to this deposition as Exhibit 3.\n8               (Exhibit 3 marked.)\n9               MS. MACKIN:  I can try to share it in the\n10 chat box.  Let me see if it will go through.  No, it’s\n11 not letting me do that; but I’ll provide them to all\n12 parties after the deposition.  Plaintiffs are welcome --\n13 sorry.  Intervenors are welcome to verify that it is, in\n14 fact, the production.\n15               MS. BRAILEY:  And, Anna, if you’re going\n16 to use specific ones, will you puts those specific pages\n17 in the chat.\n18               MS. MACKIN:  Yes, yes.\n19               MS. BRAILEY:  Okay.\n20      Q    (BY MS. MACKIN)  And, Ms. Schaumburg, did you\n21 review the documents that were produced to us before\n22 they were produced?\n23      A.   I believe so.\n24      Q.   Okay.  And do you know the names of the DSCC\n25 staff members who searched for documents to respond to\nIntegrity Legal Support Solutions\nwww.integrity-texas.com\n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 86   Filed 06/15/20   Page 17 of 150\nDSCC - 4/30/2020\n16\n1 the subpoena?\n2               MS. BRAILEY:  I’m going to object on both\n3 attorney-client privilege because of our conversations\n4 and also on the First Amendment to the strategic\n5 information.\n6               You can answer to the extent that you\n7 know and don’t reveal strategic or privileged\n8 communications.\n9      A.   No, I don’t know.\n10      Q    (BY MS. MACKIN)  Okay.  All right.  So I’d\n11 just like to briefly go through the list on page 6 of\n12 Exhibit 2.  The first category of documents, did DSCC\n13 provide documents in response to this request?\n14      A.   So I was not involved in putting together the\n15 production, but it’s -- just looking at it, it’s my\n16 understanding that the DSCC searched for and produced\n17 documents in consultation with counsel and that those\n18 documents satisfied the request.\n19      Q.   Okay.  And would that be your answer with\n20 respect to all five categories of documents listed on\n21 page 6 of Exhibit 2?\n22      A.   Yes.\n23      Q.   Okay.  In preparation for today’s deposition,\n24 did you review any documents that have not been produced\n25 to us?\nIntegrity Legal Support Solutions\nwww.integrity-texas.com\n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 86   Filed 06/15/20   Page 18 of 150\nDSCC - 4/30/2020\n17\n1               MS. BRAILEY:  I’m going to object on\n2 attorney-client privilege.\n3               You can answer to the extent that you\n4 don’t reveal privileged conversations.\n5      A.   Did I review any -- other than the filings\n6 that I mentioned, no.\n7      Q    (BY MS. MACKIN)  Okay.  And so you are\n8 currently employed by DSCC; is that right?\n9      A.   Yes.\n10      Q.   And that is a national party committee of the\n11 Democratic Party?\n12      A.   That’s correct.\n13      Q.   Okay.  What is your job title?\n14      A.   I’m the Director of Voter Protection and the\n15 Deputy Policy Director.\n16      Q.   And how long have you held that position?\n17      A.   Since early November of 2019.\n18      Q.   And before that, what was your job?\n19      A.   I was a litigation associate at WilmerHale.\n20      Q.   I cannot believe you got out of the game.\n21               So what are your job duties in your\n22 current role at DSCC?\n23      A.   So on the voter protection side, I work to\n24 manage and oversee the DSCC’s voter protection efforts.\n25 A lot of that entails working with the state voter\nIntegrity Legal Support Solutions\nwww.integrity-texas.com\n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 86   Filed 06/15/20   Page 19 of 150\nDSCC - 4/30/2020\n18\n1 protection directors in the Senate battleground states\n2 to advise and provide guidance on their voter protection\n3 programs and helping them identify issues as they come\n4 up, identify opportunities to expand voting access, and\n5 eliminate barriers and obstacles to voting.\n6               And on the policy side, a lot of it\n7 involves tracking federal legislation, what’s going on\n8 on the Senate floor, and helping our campaigns and\n9 candidates understand and follow that process and\n10 develop their policy platforms.\n11      Q.   You mentioned sort of liaising with state\n12 voter protection directors.  Is there a voter protection\n13 director for the state of Texas?\n14      A.   Yes.\n15      Q.   And what is that person’s name?\n16      A.   Rose Clouson.\n17               (Reporter requests spelling.)\n18               THE WITNESS:  C-L-O-U-S-O-N.\n19      Q    (BY MS. MACKIN)  And who do you report to\n20 within the DSCC organizational structure?\n21      A.   In the voter protection role, I would report\n22 to our executive director.\n23      Q.   What is the executive director’s name?\n24      A.   Scott Fairchild.\n25      Q.   Okay.  And then in the policy role?\nIntegrity Legal Support Solutions\nwww.integrity-texas.com\n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 86   Filed 06/15/20   Page 20 of 150\nDSCC - 4/30/2020\n19\n1      A.   I would report to the policy director.\n2      Q.   And what is that person’s name?\n3      A.   Hazeen Ashby.  I spell that.  H-A-Z-E-E-N.\n4 The last name is Ashby, A-S-H-B-Y.\n5      Q.   Does anyone report to you?\n6      A.   No.\n7      Q.   Okay.  Do you enjoy your job?\n8      A.   Yes, I do.\n9      Q.   Good.\n10               And I just briefly want to cover your\n11 educational background, starting with the most advanced\n12 degree obtained.  I assume you went to law school?\n13      A.   I did.\n14      Q.   And where did you go to law school?\n15      A.   I graduated from Harvard Law School.\n16      Q.   In what year?\n17      A.   2016.\n18      Q.   And then how about undergraduate?  Where did\n19 you go to undergraduate?\n20      A.   University of Pennsylvania.\n21      Q.   And what did you study?\n22      A.   Political science.\n23      Q.   And what year did you graduate?\n24      A.   2007.\n25      Q.   Okay.  What did you do in between college and\nIntegrity Legal Support Solutions\nwww.integrity-texas.com\n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 86   Filed 06/15/20   Page 21 of 150\nDSCC - 4/30/2020\n20\n1 law school?\n2      A.   So in 2006 I took time off of college and\n3 worked on a House race in Pennsylvania.  I continued to\n4 work on that after graduation in the ’08 and 2010\n5 cycles.  Although in 2009, in January 2009, I went to\n6 the official side for a while; and I was a Congressional\n7 staffer, a legislative aide, focused primarily on\n8 healthcare policy.  And then towards the end of the\n9 campaign cycle, I went back to the campaign side as the\n10 communications director.\n11               After 2010 -- we lost that race -- I went\n12 to work for another congressman, then Congressman Ed\n13 Markey, from Massachusetts.  I was with him through June\n14 2013.  And then went to law school in that fall.\n15      Q.   And so you mentioned working for Congressman\n16 Markey; and then, before that, you talked about a couple\n17 of roles with campaigns and then on the official side.\n18 Was that all for the same person?\n19      A.   Yes.\n20      Q.   And who was that?\n21      A.   Patrick Murphy.\n22      Q.   All right.\n23      A.   I should say on the campaign side, I served as\n24 a field organizer and also was the deputy finance\n25 director for a cycle; and then my final role was as the\nIntegrity Legal Support Solutions\nwww.integrity-texas.com\n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 86   Filed 06/15/20   Page 22 of 150\nDSCC - 4/30/2020\n21\n1 comms director.\n2      Q.   I worked on a couple of campaigns.  I know\n3 that sometimes you can wear many hats.\n4               All right.  So jumping over to the topics\n5 in the Notice, I’m just going to start with Topic 1.\n6 What is DSCC’s mission?\n7      A.   So the DSCC is the National Senatorial\n8 Committee of the Democratic Party’s organization that’s\n9 responsible for the day-to-day operations of the Party\n10 at a national level, and its mission is just to elect\n11 Democrats, Democratic candidates to the United States\n12 Senate, including candidates from Texas.\n13      Q.   And has that mission changed over time?\n14      A.   Not that I know of.\n15      Q.   Okay.  When was DSCC first established?  And\n16 I’ll say I understand that from the FEC filings, some of\n17 them say Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee; and\n18 some of them just say DSCC.  I’m referring to the same\n19 organization.\n20      A.   I would have to check.\n21      Q.   Okay.  What percentage of DSCC’s activities,\n22 just approximately, would you say are focused on voter\n23 registration?\n24               MS. BRAILEY:  I’m going to object on the\n25 First Amendment.\nIntegrity Legal Support Solutions\nwww.integrity-texas.com\n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 86   Filed 06/15/20   Page 23 of 150\nDSCC - 4/30/2020\n22\n1               You can answer at a high level.\n2      A.   So I don’t think I could give that a\n3 percentage.  It doesn’t exactly -- that’s not how we\n4 would break down our operations.  I mean, the core of\n5 what the DSCC does is working with campaigns and state\n6 parties to support a range of different activities,\n7 including field; and that would, you know, be voter\n8 registration, voter turnout, GOTV.  So it’s definitely a\n9 core part of the GOTV’s mission and activities, but\n10 it’s -- I cannot put a percentage on it.\n11               I can’t -- I don’t know if something\n12 happened with the sound.\n13      Q.   Can you hear me?\n14      A.   I can now.\n15      Q.   Okay.  I didn’t really say anything.  I said,\n16 \"Fair enough\" but kind of to myself.\n17      A.   I saw the mouth moving, but I couldn’t hear\n18 you.\n19      Q.   Sorry.\n20               Would you say at a high level that DSCC’s\n21 focus on voter registration activities has been the same\n22 over time, or has it changed?\n23               MS. BRAILEY:  Again -- I know you said\n24 \"high level,\" but just to preserve it, object on the\n25 First Amendment.\nIntegrity Legal Support Solutions\nwww.integrity-texas.com\n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 86   Filed 06/15/20   Page 24 of 150\nDSCC - 4/30/2020\n23\n1               You can answer to the extent you don’t\n2 reveal internal strategic decisions.\n3      A.   I think it’s definitely been a focus of the\n4 DSCC’s mission.  I think, you know, our focus depends --\n5 like, it will vary.  Depending on the cycle, depending\n6 on the state and what race you’re talking about, there’s\n7 different -- you know, each state is different and\n8 presents different challenges.\n9               You know, in a situation where we’re\n10 dealing with a state that has put in place a lot of\n11 obstacles to voter registration, like in Texas, then it\n12 will be an even greater focus for the DSCC if there’s --\n13 you know, if you have a situation like we have here,\n14 where the State’s not allowing simultaneous online\n15 registration, then we know that voter registration’s\n16 going to have to be a higher priority than it might be\n17 in another state where it’s easier to register folks.\n18      Q.   And would you say that -- well, strike that.\n19               Okay.  Moving on to Topic 2, DSCC’s\n20 organizational structure, how many employees does DSCC\n21 have?\n22      A.   (Inaudible.)\n23      Q.   Okay.\n24               (Reporter requests repeat.)\n25               THE WITNESS:  Roughly, a rough\nIntegrity Legal Support Solutions\nwww.integrity-texas.com\n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 86   Filed 06/15/20   Page 25 of 150\nDSCC - 4/30/2020\n24\n1 approximation, 50; but I don’t have an exact number.\n2      Q.   (BY MS. MACKIN)  Does DSCC have any parent or\n3 sibling entities?\n4               MS. BRAILEY:  I’m just going to object on\n5 First Amendment.\n6               But, obviously, you know, answer to the\n7 extent that you know it at a high level.\n8      A.   I’m not sure what you mean by -- what did you\n9 say, sister?\n10      Q.   (BY MS. MACKIN)  Sibling.\n11      A.   What do you mean by that?\n12      Q.   Well, I think we can actually explore that\n13 with an exhibit later on.  So we can move along from\n14 that.\n15               DSCC is a 501(c)(4), though, correct?\n16               MS. BRAILEY:  I’m going to object on a\n17 legal conclusion.\n18               You can answer to the extent that you\n19 know.\n20      A.   I believe that’s correct.\n21      Q    (BY MS. MACKIN)  Okay.  All right.  I want to\n22 jump down to Topic 4 and talk about DSCC’s activities in\n23 Texas.  I’d like to get a sense of the general\n24 categories, types of activities that DSCC is engaged in.\n25 So I know that it can change from cycle to cycle; and\nIntegrity Legal Support Solutions\nwww.integrity-texas.com\n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 86   Filed 06/15/20   Page 26 of 150\nDSCC - 4/30/2020\n25\n1 I’m not trying to get overly granular, just kind of --\n2 one of the things you mentioned earlier was candidate\n3 services might be, like, one bucket of activity.  How\n4 would you kind of describe the main categories of\n5 activities that DSCC conducts in Texas?\n6      A.   So the DSCC engages in a range of activities;\n7 and, again, it will depend on the particular state and\n8 particular race.  But we advise candidates and state\n9 parties to support their programs and operations.\n10               We raise and spend tens of millions of\n11 dollars that we use to support individual Senate\n12 campaigns, either via direct contributions or by making\n13 investments on behalf of the campaigns, a lot to the\n14 limit.\n15               We transfer down funding to state parties\n16 that’s used part of the coordinated campaign to hire key\n17 staffers, invest in field and turnout operations.  So\n18 that would include voter registration, persuasion, GOTV.\n19               And we invest in communications tools\n20 that would make it easier for campaigns and -- for\n21 campaigns to contact voters, like texting, dialing, that\n22 would help our candidates expand their voter\n23 registration and turnout efforts.\n24      Q.   Okay.  So, again, with the understanding that,\n25 you know, I’m not expecting you to list every discreet\nIntegrity Legal Support Solutions\nwww.integrity-texas.com\n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 86   Filed 06/15/20   Page 27 of 150\nDSCC - 4/30/2020\n26\n1 activity but just to get a sense of, like, the broad\n2 categories, what I have, based on your answer, seems to\n3 fall into -- and correct me if I’m wrong; I’m just\n4 trying to make a list -- state party support, candidate\n5 support, the coordinated campaign, and investments in\n6 communication tools.  Did I miss something,\n7 mischaracterize it?\n8      A.   When you say the state party -- I mean, the\n9 transfers down are used to support the coordinated, so.\n10      Q.   Okay.  So that’s kind of like one bucket,\n11 like, state party support, the coordinated campaign\n12 would fall within that?\n13      A.   Sure.\n14      Q.   Okay.  And so what types of -- and I know you\n15 gave some examples; but now I do want to dive a little\n16 deeper, again, with the understanding that I’m not\n17 expecting, you know, like, \"We ran this ad on March 1st\"\n18 or whatever.  But what types of activities does the DSCC\n19 engage in that you would characterize as state party\n20 support?\n21               MS. BRAILEY:  And I’ll object on the\n22 First Amendment.\n23               You can answer at a high level.\n24      A.   So we transferred down funding to the state\n25 parties; and, again, that’s used to support and finance\nIntegrity Legal Support Solutions\nwww.integrity-texas.com\n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 86   Filed 06/15/20   Page 28 of 150\nDSCC - 4/30/2020\n27\n1 activities that are part of a coordinated campaign which\n2 supports Democratic candidates up and down the ballot.\n3 And so that’s the things I’ve listed before.  It would\n4 include hiring staff, supporting field and turnout,\n5 things like that.\n6      Q.   And would you categorize voter-registration\n7 efforts as falling under that state party support\n8 umbrella?\n9      A.   In part at least.\n10      Q.   And what else might voter-registration\n11 efforts -- well, you said voter-registration efforts\n12 could, in part, be characterized as state party support.\n13 How else could they be characterized?\n14      A.   I mean, again, the communication tools that we\n15 invest in help candidates expand their voter-contact\n16 efforts, to include voter registration.\n17      Q.   And so what types of voter-registration\n18 efforts does the DSCC engage in?\n19               MS. BRAILEY:  I’ll object on the First\n20 Amendment.\n21               You can answer at a high level.\n22      A.   Sorry.  I’m just trying to distinguish from\n23 what I’ve -- what you’ve already asked.  I mean, we\n24 provide support for state parties, which is the\n25 coordinated, and comms tools.  I think that is primarily\nIntegrity Legal Support Solutions\nwww.integrity-texas.com\n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 86   Filed 06/15/20   Page 29 of 150\nDSCC - 4/30/2020\n28\n1 how we would support voter registration.\n2      Q    (BY MS. MACKIN)  So it would be like -- oh, I\n3 see.  So, like, the support that you provide to the\n4 state party, some of that is used by the state party for\n5 voter-registration efforts?  Is that what you’re saying?\n6      A.   As part of a coordinated campaign.\n7      Q.   Okay.  And then you also make investments in\n8 these tools that you make available to state parties and\n9 the tools can assist the state parties with voter\n10 registration; is that right?\n11      A.   My understanding is that the communications\n12 tools are something we provide to individual campaigns.\n13 I’m not sure if we provide that to the state party.\n14      Q.   So I’m getting a sense that the ways that DSCC\n15 support voter-registration efforts are, Number 1, by\n16 providing funds to state parties, which then use those\n17 funds for voter-registration efforts.  And, Number 2, by\n18 providing communications tools to campaigns, which the\n19 campaigns can then use for voter-registration efforts;\n20 is that right?\n21      A.   It also provides funding to individual\n22 campaigns that might use that for voter registration.\n23      Q.   Okay.  And when you provide funds to a state\n24 party, do you -- I want to say earmark; but I know that\n25 has, like, a legal connotation in a campaign finance\nIntegrity Legal Support Solutions\nwww.integrity-texas.com\n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 86   Filed 06/15/20   Page 30 of 150\nDSCC - 4/30/2020\n29\n1 context.  So that’s not really what I mean.  Like, when\n2 you provide funds to state parties, do you specify, \"Use\n3 these funds for voter registration\"; or is up to the\n4 party to take the funds that it receives from DSCC and\n5 then decide to use them for voter registration?\n6               MS. BRAILEY:  I’m going to object on the\n7 First Amendment.\n8               You can answer at high level.\n9               But I’m also going to object on form that\n10 it’s vague and compound.\n11      A.   Yeah.  Can I -- sorry.  Can I ask you to\n12 rephrase?\n13      Q    (BY MS. MACKIN)  Sure.  So -- actually, I kind\n14 of forgot my question.\n15               MS. MACKIN:  Debbie, would you mind\n16 reading it back, just to remind me; and then I will\n17 rephrase it.\n18               THE REPORTER:  Okay.\n19               MS.

MACKIN:  Now I remember.\n2      Q    (BY MS. MACKIN)  So when the DSCC provides\n3 funds to a state party, will it ever specify that those\n4 funds are to be used for voter registration?\n5               MS. BRAILEY:  Objection on the First\n6 Amendment.\n7               You can answer at a high level.\n8      A.   Specify in what way?\n9      Q    (BY MS. MACKIN)  In any way.\n10      A.   My understanding is that we would not.  And I\n11 don’t -- you know, that we provide funding to the state\n12 party; but it’s not designated for particular specific\n13 purposes.\n14      Q.   Okay.\n15      A.   I think the -- you know, in deciding -- well,\n16 I’ll leave it at that.\n17      Q.   Okay.  Thank you.\n18               And then when DSCC provides support to\n19 campaigns, will it ever designate the funds it provides\n20 for voter registration activities?\n21               MS. BRAILEY:  Objection on the First\n22 Amendment.\n23               You can answer at a high level.\n24               And, also, an objection to a legal\n25 conclusion.\nIntegrity Legal Support Solutions\nwww.integrity-texas.com\n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 86   Filed 06/15/20   Page 32 of 150\nDSCC - 4/30/2020\n31\n1               So just answer to the extent that you\n2 know in your experience.\n3      A.   Not to my knowledge.\n4      Q    (BY MS. MACKIN)  Okay.  And when the DSCC\n5 makes communication tools available to campaigns, will\n6 it ever designate those tools to be used specifically\n7 for voter registration purposes?\n8               MS. BRAILEY:  Same objection, First\n9 Amendment.\n10               You can answer at a high level.\n11               And legal conclusion.\n12               If you know what it means in your\n13 experience.\n14      A.   I’m not really sure -- I’m not sure I totally\n15 understand the question.  I mean, there are\n16 communication tools which are, by definition, meant to\n17 communicate with voters for doing -- for voter-contact\n18 activities which would include voter registration.  So I\n19 think it’s sort of inherent to the nature of the tool.\n20      Q.   (BY MS. MACKIN)  But the tool can be used for\n21 multiple purposes, right?\n22      A.   It’s for voter contact.\n23      Q.   Okay.  And just to make sure I’m clear, does\n24 DSCC itself conduct voter registration activities in\n25 Texas?\nIntegrity Legal Support Solutions\nwww.integrity-texas.com\n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 86   Filed 06/15/20   Page 33 of 150\nDSCC - 4/30/2020\n32\n1               MS. BRAILEY:  Objection on the First\n2 Amendment.\n3               Answer at a high level.\n4      A.   Other than what I’ve described?\n5      Q    (BY MS. MACKIN)  Other than by providing\n6 support to candidates and campaigns who can then conduct\n7 voter-registration activities.\n8      A.   I mean, I think that there could be instances\n9 where DSCC staff advise, whether by training or other\n10 guidance, on voter-registration activities, in addition\n11 to everything that we’ve already talked about.\n12      Q.   Okay.  Anything else?\n13      A.   On?  I’m sorry.  Anything else...\n14      Q.   Does DSCC conduct any other voter-registration\n15 activities in Texas besides the support it provides to\n16 state parties, the support it provides to campaigns; and\n17 then you mentioned the possibility of DSCC staff\n18 providing guidance or training on voter registration?\n19      A.   That’s all I can think of.\n20      Q.   Okay.  How often would you say DSCC’s staff\n21 has provided guidance on voter registration in Texas?\n22      A.   How often?\n23      Q.   Uh-huh.\n24      A.   What do you mean by, like --\n25      Q.   Well, you mentioned that it might happen.  And\nIntegrity Legal Support Solutions\nwww.integrity-texas.com\n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 86   Filed 06/15/20   Page 34 of 150\nDSCC - 4/30/2020\n33\n1 so I’m just trying to get a sense of whether that has,\n2 in fact, happened or it’s more of a hypothetical\n3 possibility.\n4      A.   I mean, it has certainly happened.  It’s\n5 hard -- I’m not sure how -- how often.  You know, like I\n6 said, they would advise as needed.  It depends, again,\n7 on the other needs of the campaign and what’s going on\n8 in a particular state.\n9      Q.   Okay.\n10      A.   But we certainly do provide guidance and\n11 training and, you know, expertise on all things field\n12 and voter contact; and voter registration is a big part\n13 of that.\n14      Q.   Any other voter-registration activities that\n15 DSCC has engaged in in Texas?\n16      A.   Again, that’s all I can think of.\n17      Q.   Okay.  How much did DSCC spend on voter\n18 registration in Texas in 2014?\n19               MS. BRAILEY:  Objection on the First\n20 Amendment.\n21               Just answer at a high level.\n22      A.   It’s not like there’s a line item for\n23 voter-registration efforts, so it’s hard for me to\n24 answer that.\n25      Q    (BY MS. MACKIN)  And would your answer be the\nIntegrity Legal Support Solutions\nwww.integrity-texas.com\n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 86   Filed 06/15/20   Page 35 of 150\nDSCC - 4/30/2020\n34\n1 same for the years 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019?\n2      A.   My answer to the question of how much did the\n3 DSCC spend on voter registration?  Yes.\n4      Q.   And would that also be your answer for how\n5 much the DSCC spent on voter registration in 2020?\n6      A.   I mean, again, there’s no line item for voter\n7 registration.  So in 2020 we’ve made investments in\n8 Texas and we expect to make significantly more, given\n9 the state of that race; but there’s not a particular --\n10 there’s not a specific, like, line item for voter\n11 registration in the budget or something like that.\n12      Q.   Okay.  What investments have you made in\n13 Texas?\n14               MS. BRAILEY:  Again, I’ll object to the\n15 First Amendment.\n16               But you can answer at a high level.\n17      A.   What time period are you talking about?\n18      Q    (BY MS. MACKIN)  In 2020.\n19      A.   Like, in the 2020 cycle?\n20      Q.   Well, sure.\n21      A.   Okay.  Because that would be 2019, too.\n22      Q.   Okay.  Fair enough.\n23      A.   So for this cycle, it’s my understanding that\n24 we have invested nearly $200,000 in Texas in various\n25 ways.  I know we’ve max’ed out to the MJ for Senate\nIntegrity Legal Support Solutions\nwww.integrity-texas.com\n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 86   Filed 06/15/20   Page 36 of 150\nDSCC - 4/30/2020\n35\n1 Campaign.  We’ve done $25,000 in transfer downs and\n2 roughly a hundred thousand in polling.\n3      Q.   And do you know if any of those investments\n4 have been used for voter-registration activities?\n5      A.   So I do know that TDP is -- as you might be\n6 aware, is undertaking the biggest voter registration\n7 initiative in the history of the state party.  And so\n8 it’s my understanding that, again, the funding that we\n9 provide to the state party is used for coordinated\n10 campaign expenses; and so that would all be part of\n11 those efforts.\n12      Q.   All right.  Other than the funds that DSCC\n13 transferred down to TDP, do you know if any of its other\n14 investments in the 2019-2020 cycle in Texas have been\n15 used for voter registration?\n16      A.   So I don’t know specifically; but I do want to\n17 make two points, just to make sure this is clear so --\n18 as far as the funding goes, because you’re asking about\n19 what we’ve done so far.  As far as transfer down\n20 funding, it’s very early in the cycle to be assessing\n21 the level of transfer down funding.  You know, a lot of\n22 those investments are things you wouldn’t expect to see\n23 until later in the cycle, with early voting not starting\n24 for six months.\n25               So we’ve done, you know, what we’ve done\nIntegrity Legal Support Solutions\nwww.integrity-texas.com\n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 86   Filed 06/15/20   Page 37 of 150\nDSCC - 4/30/2020\n36\n1 so far; but on a related note, you know, we intend to\n2 spend significantly more in Texas than what we’ve seen\n3 already, easily into the millions, given the\n4 competitiveness of the race and the fact that the DSCC\n5 is aware of several obstacles that Texas has put in\n6 place to turning out voters, including the failure to\n7 allow for simultaneous online registration.  So I just\n8 wanted to make sure that was clear.\n9      Q.   Okay.  Thank you for that.\n10               But so far in the 2019-2020 cycle, you\n11 mentioned that the DSCC has transferred money to the TDP\n12 that might be used for voter registration.  Other than\n13 that, has the DSCC made any other investments in the\n14 2019-2020 cycle that can be used for voter registration?\n15      A.   So I listed all of the investments that we’ve\n16 made in Texas that I’m aware of; and, again, we’ll just\n17 stress that the DSCC intends to make significantly more\n18 investments as the cycle progresses.\n19      Q.   Sure.  Fair enough.  But to date.\n20               MS. BRAILEY:  I’m going to object on the\n21 form.\n22               You can answer if you understand.\n23      A.   So I think I’ve answered it.  I’ve listed the\n24 investments in Texas in this cycle that I’m aware of.\n25      Q.   (BY MS. MACKIN)  Right.  And I’m sorry if my\nIntegrity Legal Support Solutions\nwww.integrity-texas.com\n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 86   Filed 06/15/20   Page 38 of 150\nDSCC - 4/30/2020\n37\n1 question wasn’t clear.  I was asking which of those\n2 investments have been used for voter registration.\n3               MS. BRAILEY:  I’m going to object on form\n4 again.\n5      A.   So we contributed to the MJ for Senate.  I’m\n6 not -- I can’t -- I don’t know what exactly that is\n7 being used for; but we have provided the maximum amount\n8 that we are able to, to her campaign directly, which I\n9 think could be used for voter registration.\n10               We’ve given 25,000 to the coordinated,\n11 which engages in voter-registration efforts and intend\n12 to do more -- anticipate doing more through the\n13 coordinated.\n14      Q.   (BY MS. MACKIN)  Okay.  And do you know how\n15 much of that 25,000 to the coordinated has been used for\n16 voter registration?\n17      A.   Sitting here, I couldn’t give you a specific\n18 amount.  Again, I don’t -- I can’t speak to TDP’s, you\n19 know, recordkeeping; but, like, the DS, as I said\n20 before, it’s not like there’s a line item for voter\n21 registration.  But I do know that TDP is undertaking a\n22 huge voter-registration effort, in part, to compensate\n23 for some of the unique challenges that it faces in the\n24 state.\n25      Q.   Okay.  So now I’m a little bit confused.

No, to the -- sorry.\n5      Q.   No, please go ahead.  I’m trying to\n6 understand, so correct me.\n7      A.   The funding to the state party is -- when I\n8 say \"transfer down,\" that’s funding that we transfer\n9 down from the DSCC to the state party that is used for\n10 the coordinated campaign expenses.\n11      Q.   Okay.  So I’ve got funds to TDP and funds to\n12 MJ for Senate; is that -- is that right?  Sorry.  That’s\n13 a terrible question.\n14               For your investments in Texas in the\n15 2019-2020, I’ve got funds to TDP and funds to MJ for\n16 Senate.  Is there anything else?\n17      A.   I also mentioned the polling.\n18      Q.   Polling.  Okay.  Tell me about that.\n19               MS. BRAILEY:  Objection, vague.\n20      A.   Can you clarify?\n21      Q    (BY MS. MACKIN)  What do you mean by\n22 \"polling\"?  I don’t --\n23      A.   Like, what is polling?\n24      Q.   Like, you say you have invested in polling.\n25 Do you know if any of your investments in -- so if you\nIntegrity Legal Support Solutions\nwww.integrity-texas.com\n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 86   Filed 06/15/20   Page 40 of 150\nDSCC - 4/30/2020\n39\n1 invested in polling, those funds would not be used for\n2 voter registration, right?  They’d be used for polling?\n3      A.   Yes.\n4      Q.   Okay.  And then, so other than the funds to\n5 TDP, the funds to MJ for Senate, and the investments in\n6 polling, have you made any other investments in Texas in\n7 the 2019 to 2020 cycle so far?\n8               MS. BRAILEY:  Objection in that it\n9 mischaracterizes the testimony.\n10      Q.   (BY MS. MACKIN)  And if I’ve got it wrong,\n11 please tell me.  I’m just trying to get the list.\n12      A.   Can you repeat the question?\n13      Q.   Sure.  So in the 2019 to 2020 cycle, DSCC has\n14 invested in Texas in the following ways:  Funds to TDP,\n15 fund to MJ for Senate, and investments in polling.  Is\n16 there anything else so far?\n17      A.   It this --\n18               THE WITNESS:  I’m sorry.  Emily, did\n19 you...\n20      A.   At this stage of the cycle, that’s my\n21 understanding of our investments in the state.\n22      Q.   (BY MS. MACKIN)  Thank you for that.\n23               All right.  And jumping back to the\n24 previous cycle, 2017 to 2018, did DSCC make any\n25 investments in voter registration in Texas in the 2017-\nIntegrity Legal Support Solutions\nwww.integrity-texas.com\n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 86   Filed 06/15/20   Page 41 of 150\nDSCC - 4/30/2020\n40\n1 2018 cycle?\n2      A.   So I don’t -- I mean, as far as expenditures\n3 that the DSCC made to Texas in the 2018 cycle, I’m aware\n4 that I believe we spent, like, $35,000 on polling.  I’m\n5 not aware of specific, like, itemized expenditures.\n6 That’s not to say that -- like, there could have been\n7 staff time spent on supporting voter-registration\n8 efforts, but not that I’m aware of.\n9      Q.   Okay.  In the 2015 to 2016 cycle, are you\n10 aware of DSCC making any investments in voter\n11 registration in Texas?\n12      A.   When you say \"investments,\" can you -- like,\n13 what are you...\n14      Q.   I’m tracking the language in your Complaint.\n15 So if there’s a better way to describe it, please let me\n16 know.\n17      A.   So I’m not aware of expenditures that the DSCC\n18 made to Texas in the 2016 cycle.\n19      Q.   So there weren’t any that you’re aware of?\n20               MS. BRAILEY:  Objection, mischaracterizes\n21 the testimony.\n22      A.   I’m not aware of expenditures that the DSCC\n23 made in Texas in 2016.\n24      Q    (BY MS.

If you’re asking -- 2015 would be part of the\n2 2016 cycle, so --\n3      Q.   Okay.\n4      A.   -- my answer was to the 2016 cycle.\n5      Q.   Okay.  And so that includes 2015 as well?\n6      A.   Calendar year 2015 would be part of the 2016\n7 election cycle.\n8      Q.   Okay.  And then, are you aware of the DSCC\n9 making any expenditures for voter registration in Texas\n10 in the 2014 cycle?\n11      A.   As with the 2016 cycle, I’m not aware of DSCC\n12 expenditures in Texas in the 2014 cycle.\n13      Q.   Okay.\n14               MS. BRAILEY:  Anna, are we getting to a\n15 point where we might be able to take a break?  We’re\n16 about at the hour.\n17               MS. MACKIN:  Yeah, that’s fine.  We can\n18 take a quick break now.  How long --\n19               Let’s go off the record.\n20               THE REPORTER:  Going off the record at\n21 11:11 a.m.\n22               (Off the record from 11:11 to 11:26 a.m.)\n23               THE REPORTER:  Going back on the record\n24 at 11:26 a.m.\n25               MS. MACKIN:  I’m sharing a document in\nIntegrity Legal Support Solutions\nwww.integrity-texas.com\n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 86   Filed 06/15/20   Page 43 of 150\nDSCC - 4/30/2020\n42\n1 the chat box -- two documents, actually; and they are\n2 Bates numbered -- the first one begins at DSCC 796 and\n3 goes through 797; and the second one begins at DSCC 798\n4 and goes through 799.\n5      Q.   (BY MS. MACKIN)  Please take a look at those\n6 documents and let me know when you’re ready to discuss\n7 them.\n8      A.   Okay.\n9      Q.   So the page labeled DSCC 796 through 797, do\n10 you recognize this document?\n11      A.   I think it was -- I recognize it as -- I\n12 believe as part of the production.\n13      Q.   Okay.  Have you seen it before?\n14      A.   Before right now?\n15      Q.   Yes.\n16      A.   Again, I reviewed the production before it\n17 went out.  So I think -- I believe this is part of\n18 production, so I would have seen it then.\n19      Q.   Okay.  Do you recall whether you saw it before\n20 reviewing the production?\n21      A.   I don’t.\n22      Q.   Okay.  Based on your experience with the DSCC,\n23 what does this e-mail appear to be?\n24      A.   It appears to be an e-mail asking a survey\n25 question.\nIntegrity Legal Support Solutions\nwww.integrity-texas.com\n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 86   Filed 06/15/20   Page 44 of 150\nDSCC - 4/30/2020\n43\n1      Q.   And do you know whether the document that\n2 begins at 798 reflects a question that was asked on the\n3 survey linked in the e-mail, labeled 796?\n4      A.   I wouldn’t be able to tell you.\n5      Q.   Okay.  At a high level, what is the purpose of\n6 sending out a survey to -- here it says, \"The audience\n7 of highly reliable Democrats\"?\n8               MS. BRAILEY:  Objection on the First\n9 Amendment.\n10               You can answer at a high level to the\n11 extent you don’t reveal internal strategic decisions.\n12      A.   Generally speaking, the DSCC wants to hear\n13 from Democratic voters around the country, understand\n14 what their priorities are, what folks’ concerns are, and\n15 just get a sense of that.  And so I think that outreach\n16 like this would be an attempt to obtain that insight.\n17      Q.   (BY MS. MACKIN)  Do you know approximately how\n18 often DSCC conducts surveys like this?\n19      A.   I don’t.  I mean, I would say it’s not\n20 infrequently; but it’s hard for me to be more specific.\n21      Q.   And then, turning to the page -- well,\n22 actually, that’s all I have on those.\n23               MS. MACKIN:  All right.  I am pulling\n24 up -- well, I’m sharing in the chat box an exhibit -- a\n25 document, rather; and it will be a page from Exhibit 3,\nIntegrity Legal Support Solutions\nwww.integrity-texas.com\n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 86   Filed 06/15/20   Page 45 of 150\nDSCC - 4/30/2020\n44\n1 the document marked DSCC 800.\n2      Q.   (BY MS. MACKIN)  Please take a look at that\n3 document, and let me know when you are ready to discuss\n4 it.\n5      A.   Okay.\n6      Q.   This is an e-mail dated April 18th, 2020 that\n7 appears to have been sent from info@DSCC.org, with the\n8 name Chuck Schumer; is that right?\n9      A.   Yes.\n10      Q.   Okay.  And at a high level, what is the\n11 purpose of an e-mail like this?\n12               MS. BRAILEY:  Objection on the First\n13 Amendment.\n14               You can answer to the extent it doesn’t\n15 reveal internal strategic decisions.\n16      A.   This is a fundraising e-mail.\n17      Q.   (BY MS. MACKIN)  Okay.  And about halfway down\n18 the page there’s a paragraph that begins, \"We’re already\n19 putting your funds to work making crucial investments\n20 that will make the difference on Election Day.  Your\n21 support is funding things like advertising to boost our\n22 Democratic Senate candidates and registering a record\n23 number of new voters in swing states.\"  Did I read that\n24 correctly?\n25      A.   Yes.\nIntegrity Legal Support Solutions\nwww.integrity-texas.com\n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 86   Filed 06/15/20   Page 46 of 150\nDSCC - 4/30/2020\n45\n1      Q.   And this mention of registering a record\n2 number of new voters in swing states, does that include\n3 the -- well, is that a reference to any activities in\n4 Texas?\n5      A.   I’m not sure what the drafter of this e-mail\n6 is specifically referring to, but certainly we have\n7 made investments in Texas that will further voter-\n8 registration efforts.  And so -- I’ll leave it at that.\n9               But I can’t -- I don’t know what the\n10 person who drafted this was specifically referring to,\n11 if they had Texas in mind.\n12      Q.   And so it also mentions a record number of new\n13 voters.  I guess I’m -- can you help me understand what\n14 is meant by \"a record number\" in this context?\n15      A.   So, again, I didn’t draft this; and I don’t\n16 know exactly what the drafter meant.  But, generally, a\n17 record number means more than have been registered\n18 through our efforts before.\n19      Q.   Okay.\n20      A.   And as I said earlier, again, TDP is in the\n21 midst of a massive voter registration campaign that\n22 transfer down funding from the DS would help to support,\n23 so.\n24      Q.   All right.  Thank you.\n25               All right.  That’s all I have on that.\nIntegrity Legal Support Solutions\nwww.integrity-texas.com\n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 86   Filed 06/15/20   Page 47 of 150\nDSCC - 4/30/2020\n46\n1               MS.

I don’t believe I’ve seen this document\n10 before.\n11      Q.   Okay.  Based on looking at it, what does it\n12 appear to be?\n13      A.   The title of the document is Statement of\n14 Organization.\n15      Q.   And it is a Federal Election Commission form\n16 that appears to have been submitted by the DSCC to the\n17 Federal Election Commission?\n18      A.   That seems right.\n19      Q.   Okay.  And scrolling down to page 3 of this\n20 document, there is a box for \"Name of Any Connected\n21 Organization, Affiliated Committee, Joint Fundraising\n22 Representative or Leadership PAC Sponsor.\"  And beneath\n23 that it says, \"Colorado Senate Victory 2016.\"  Are you\n24 familiar with Colorado Senate Victory 2016?\n25      A.   No.\nIntegrity Legal Support Solutions\nwww.integrity-texas.com\n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 86   Filed 06/15/20   Page 48 of 150\nDSCC - 4/30/2020\n47\n1      Q.   Okay.  Do you know if it is active in Texas?\n2               MS. BRAILEY:  Objection that this calls\n3 for a legal conclusion and is outside of the scope of\n4 the Deposition Notice.\n5               But you can answer to the extent that you\n6 know.\n7               MS. MACKIN:  And I’ll just note that the\n8 Notice does include all activities in Texas.  And so if\n9 this entity has acted in Texas, I think it would fall\n10 within the scope of the Notice.\n11               MS. BRAILEY:  Same objection.\n12               But you can answer.\n13      A.   I’m not aware.  I’m not familiar with the\n14 entity.\n15      Q.   (BY MS.

I’m not familiar with it, no.\n25      Q.   (BY MS.

Scrolling down to\n10 page 7 there’s an entry for \"Pennsylvania Senate 2016.\"\n11 It’s listed as a Joint Fundraising Representative by the\n12 box indicated on the form.  Are you familiar with\n13 Pennsylvania Senate 2016?\n14               MS.

So if we’re going to go page by page, can I\n25 say that I’m going to make the same objection to these\nIntegrity Legal Support Solutions\nwww.integrity-texas.com\n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 86   Filed 06/15/20   Page 50 of 150\nDSCC - 4/30/2020\n49\n1 pages so that I don’t interrupt you; or I can just keep\n2 making the same objection?\n3               MS. MACKIN:  I’m fine with that.\n4               MS. BRAILEY:  So for the record, I’ll\n5 make the same objection, legal conclusion and outside\n6 the scope for each of the pages 8 through 14 on\n7 Exhibit 4.\n8               You can answer.\n9      A.   No.  And I’ll have the same answer for the\n10 rest of the pages.\n11      Q    (BY MS.

No.  I mean, we can go through it but...\n18      Q.   I mean, we don’t have to.  If you’re not\n19 familiar, I don’t need to burn anybody’s time.\n20               All right.  We will X out of that one.\n21               MS. MACKIN:  Okay.  I am sharing a\n22 document in the chat box that will be Exhibit 5 to this\n23 deposition.\n24               (Exhibit 5 marked.)\n25      Q    (BY MS. MACKIN)  And your counsel provided\nIntegrity Legal Support Solutions\nwww.integrity-texas.com\n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 86   Filed 06/15/20   Page 51 of 150\nDSCC - 4/30/2020\n50\n1 this to us via a link.  Please go ahead and open up that\n2 document, and let me know when you are ready to discuss\n3 it.\n4      A.   Okay.\n5      Q.   Your counsel has represented to us this list\n6 reflects all of the transfers DSCC has made to the Texas\n7 Democratic Party between 2014 and the present; is that\n8 accurate?\n9      A.   I’m sorry.  What date was this sent?\n10      Q.   Yesterday, so --\n11      A.   It’s my understanding that, like, maybe\n12 yesterday or the day before, I think there was an\n13 additional transfer.\n14      Q.   Okay.\n15      A.   But it’s all public.  So if you go on FEC’s\n16 website and you look up DSCC’s disbursements to the\n17 Texas Democratic Party, you can find it.\n18      Q.   Okay.  And does it appear that the criteria\n19 that were used to pull this report would pull all the\n20 transfers DSCC has made to the Texas Democratic Party\n21 between 2014 and the date that the report is run?\n22               MS. BRAILEY:  Objection to form.\n23      A.   Yeah.  Sorry.  You say criteria?\n24      Q.   (BY MS. MACKIN)  So at the top -- sure.  It\n25 says, \"Disbursements.\"  And then it says, \"Viewing\nIntegrity Legal Support Solutions\nwww.integrity-texas.com\n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 86   Filed 06/15/20   Page 52 of 150\nDSCC - 4/30/2020\n51\n1 filtered results.\"  And underneath, there are some what\n2 appear to be filters that were input into the FEC\n3 website to pull this data.  So if I were to enter these\n4 filters and run this report, let’s say, today, as long\n5 as an additional disbursement had been processed, it\n6 would appear on that report, right?\n7               MS. BRAILEY:  Objection to form.\n8      A.   If you searched for the spender as the DSCC\n9 and the recipient as the Texas Democratic Party, that’s\n10 all public.  Everything that the DSCC brings in and\n11 every penny that the DSCC spends is public, and that’s\n12 what the FEC filings would reflect.\n13      Q    (BY MS. MACKIN)  Okay.  Thank you.\n14               Does DSCC have members who are eligible\n15 to vote in Texas?\n16               MS. BRAILEY:  Objection, that it calls\n17 for a legal conclusion.\n18               You can answer to the extent that you\n19 know.\n20      A.   What do you mean by members?\n21      Q.   (BY MS. MACKIN)  Well, does DSCC have members?\n22               MS. BRAILEY:  Again, objection to a legal\n23 conclusion.\n24               You can answer.\n25      A.   What do you mean by members?\nIntegrity Legal Support Solutions\nwww.integrity-texas.com\n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 86   Filed 06/15/20   Page 53 of 150\nDSCC - 4/30/2020\n52\n1      Q    (BY MS. MACKIN)  I guess whatever that means\n2 to you.  I mean, is DSCC a -- is DSCC comprised of --\n3 does it represent the Democratic members of the Senate?\n4 Would those folks be regarded by DSCC as its members?\n5               MS. BRAILEY:  Objection to a legal\n6 conclusion.\n7               But you can answer.\n8      A.   I don’t know what our corporate filings would\n9 say about members.  I mean, to the extent that you’re\n10 asking how does DSCC interact with or associate with\n11 Democratic voters around the country, I mean, we have\n12 folks who sign up for our Listserv.  We have people who\n13 donate to the DSCC.  You know, I don’t know that we have\n14 a set term for them.  I think we call them \"people on\n15 the Listserv\" or \"donors\" or \"supporters.\"\n16      Q.   Okay.\n17               MS. MACKIN:  I think that this is\n18 probably all I have; but do you mind if we go off the\n19 record for, like, five minutes for me to just take a\n20 look at my notes and make sure that I’ve covered\n21 everything?\n22               MS. BRAILEY:  Yeah, absolutely.\n23               THE REPORTER:  Going off the record at\n24 11:48 a.m.\n25               (Off the record from 11:48 to 11:58 a.m.)\nIntegrity Legal Support Solutions\nwww.integrity-texas.com\n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 86   Filed 06/15/20   Page 54 of 150\nDSCC - 4/30/2020\n53\n1               THE REPORTER:  Going back on the record\n2 at 11:58 a.m.\n3      Q    (BY MS. MACKIN)  All right.  Just a few more\n4 questions, Ms. Schaumburg.\n5               Has the DSCC developed any voter\n6 registration training materials?\n7               MS. BRAILEY:  Objection on the First\n8 Amendment.\n9               You can answer at a high level.\n10      A.   What do you mean by \"training materials\"?\n11      Q    (BY MS. MACKIN)  Sure.  Any documents that you\n12 might provide to campaigns or DSCC staff to assist in\n13 voter-registration efforts.\n14      A.   So sitting here, I can’t tell you.  I’d have\n15 to check.\n16      Q.   Does the DSCC ever communicate with individual\n17 voters to assist them with voter registration?\n18      A.   Generally, the DSCC supports voter-\n19 registration efforts in states through the means that\n20 we’ve talked about, less on an individual basis, not\n21 that it wouldn’t happen; but we provide support,\n22 funding, resources to state parties, to the campaigns\n23 for their grounding.\n24      Q.   Rather than DSCC actually communicating with\n25 the individual voter?\nIntegrity Legal Support Solutions\nwww.integrity-texas.com\n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 86   Filed 06/15/20   Page 55 of 150\nDSCC - 4/30/2020\n54\n1      A.   Not that we couldn’t.\n2      Q.   Are you aware of it ever happening?\n3      A.   Of -- sorry.  Am I aware of...\n4      Q.   Are you aware of the DSCC ever communicating\n5 directly with an individual voter to assist them with\n6 their voter registration in Texas?\n7      A.   So in a sense that, yeah, I mean, the DSCC had\n8 staff on the ground.  Again, like, DSCC funded\n9 positions.  You know, those staffers could be in charge\n10 of working on voter registration.  So in that sense,\n11 sure.\n12      Q.   Okay.  But what I’m trying to get at is a DSCC\n13 employee specifically.  Are you aware of a DSCC employee\n14 ever communicating with a Texas voter to assist them\n15 with their voter registration?\n16               MS. BRAILEY:  Objection.  I think that\n17 was just asked and answered from her last answer.\n18      Q.   (BY MS. MACKIN)  I was just hoping for a \"yes\"\n19 or \"no,\" like a clear answer.\n20      A.   So I think your first question was about Texas\n21 specifically.  So can you rephrase your question?\n22      Q.   It was, but I’ll ask it again.  Are you aware\n23 of any DSCC employee directly communicating with a Texas\n24 voter to assist them with their voter registration?\n25      A.   So I think generally the DSCC supports voter-\nIntegrity Legal Support Solutions\nwww.integrity-texas.com\n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 86   Filed 06/15/20   Page 56 of 150\nDSCC - 4/30/2020\n55\n1 registration activities by the things we’ve talked\n2 about.\n3      Q.   And would that be a \"no\"?\n4      A.   It’s possible that they have.\n5      Q.   Are you aware of any specific instance?\n6      A.   Sitting here today, can I name a specific\n7 instance, like, a date and time?  Not to that level of\n8 specificity.  But the DSCC provides voter registration\n9 guidance, and it’s -- you know, we do interact with\n10 individual voters in certain situations.  So it’s\n11 just...\n12      Q.   So I guess I’m still just looking for, like, a\n13 \"yes\" or a \"no.\"\n14               MS. BRAILEY:  I’m going to object, again,\n15 on form.\n16      Q    (BY MS.

Just going over the subpoena duces\n6 tecum, the documents that were subpoenaed for today’s\n7 deposition, Category 1, which requests documents\n8 sufficient to substantiate certain factual allegations\n9 in your Complaint, do you know whether any documents\n10 were withheld in responding to this request on the basis\n11 of privilege?\n12               MS.

Ms. Schaumburg, earlier today counsel asked\n21 you about money that the DSCC transferred to the Texas\n22 Democratic Party.  Do you remember that?\n23      A.   Yes.\n24      Q.   And then I believe she also asked you\n25 questions about money that the DSCC transferred to the\nIntegrity Legal Support Solutions\nwww.integrity-texas.com\n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 86   Filed 06/15/20   Page 59 of 150\nDSCC - 4/30/2020\n58\n1 Texas Democratic Party specifically this cycle.  Do you\n2 remember that?\n3      A.   Yes.\n4      Q.   Okay.  For that money that was transferred to\n5 TDP for this cycle, did T -- was that money used by TDP\n6 for voter-persuasion efforts?\n7      A.   That’s my understanding.\n8      Q.   And was is it used for voter-registration\n9 efforts?\n10      A.   That’s my understanding, yes.\n11      Q.   And was it used for Get-Out-the-Vote efforts?\n12      A.   So it’s my understanding that it will be used\n13 for Get-Out-the-Vote efforts.  It’s, you know, a program\n14 that would ramp up closer to election day.\n15      Q.   And how do you know that the money transferred\n16 to TDP in this cycle from DSCC is used in these ways?\n17      A.   I mean, we -- we work closely with the state\n18 parties in our -- in the Senate states, including with\n19 the Texas Democratic Party, on programming, on advising\n20 them on various aspects of their campaign.  And so, you\n21 know, we share our -- the DS and its employees share\n22 their insight and their expertise on how to manage a\n23 campaign, what the priorities should look like.  And\n24 certainly voter registration is one of those top\n25 priorities and, you know, that the TDP’s budget, what\nIntegrity Legal Support Solutions\nwww.integrity-texas.com\n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 86   Filed 06/15/20   Page 60 of 150\nDSCC - 4/30/2020\n59\n1 they prioritize, the more funding that they have from\n2 whatever sources, the more they can invest in those\n3 activities.  And so, you know, I think by providing,\n4 we’ve conveyed that voter registration is one of our\n5 priorities; and, you know, the more budget that TDP has\n6 to spend, the more they can invest in activities around\n7 that.\n8      Q.   Great.  Thank you.\n9               MS. BRAILEY:  Those are all my questions.\n10 I’ll pass the witness.\n11               MS. MACKIN:  All right.  And I’d just\n12 like to note that we are going to hold this deposition\n13 open to the extent that there is any subsequent\n14 delinquent production of documents; and once we have an\n15 opportunity to evaluate the claims of privilege.

DSCC, AND \nDCCC'S COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \nNATURE OF THE CASE \n1.  This  action  seeks  declaratory  and  injunctive  relief  to  redress  Defendants' \nsystematic and continuing violation of the U.S.  Constitution's  guarantee of equal protection. \nIntervenor-Plaintiffs, whO have invested á'nd plan to invest substantially in voter registration efforts \nthroughout the state and  among whose membership are eligible Texas voters  who utilize the \nDepartment  of Public  Safety's  (\"DPS\")  online  portal  for  renewal  and  change  of address \ntransactions, have been  injured by Defendants'  continuing unconstitutional treatment of these \nindividuals, who are arbitrarily subject to differential treatment regarding their efforts to register \n1 Intervenor-Plaintiffs have substituted the name of the current Texas Secretary of State in this case \npursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 25(d). \nExhibit             \nSara Schaumburg\n1\n4/30/20  DC\n\nCCaassee 5 5:2:106--ccvv--0000024567--OOLLGG     D Dooccuummeennt t8 163  7 F   ilFeidle 0d6 0/115/2/210/2  0 P   aPgaeg 6e5 2 o of f1 1520\nto vote solely because they choose to utilize DPS's online portal for renewal and change of address \ntransactions rather than accomplishing these tasks in person or by mail. Texas voters will continue \nto be  shut out of the democratic process unless  and until Defendants reform their registration \npractices. \n2.  Defendants permit certain Texas driver's license holders to renew their license \nand/or update the address on their license online on DPS' website at www.txdps.state.tx.us. While \nthere have been many different iterations of this online process over the years, see Stringer v. \nFablos, 320 F. Supp. 3d 862, 869, 871, 876,  (W.D. Tex. 2018), none have offered any means for \nsimultaneous voter registration. Today, despite years of litigation over this issue before this Court, \nDefendants still fail to allow for simultaneous registration with online renewals and changes of \naddress. See Press Release, Ken Paxton, Attorney General of Texas, Fifth Circuit Rules in Favor \nof  Texas  Voter  Registration  System  in  \"Motor  Voter\"  Lawsuit  (Nov.  14,  2019), \nhttps://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/news/releases/fifth-circuit-rules-favor-texas-voter- \nregistration-system-motor-voter-lawsuit (\"Currently,  Texans  who  use  the  DPS  driver  license \nrenewal and change-of-address website are sent to a separate page  administered by the Texas \nSecretary of State  where they can complete an online application, print it out, sign it, and mail it \nto their county voter registrar to ensure their ability to vote in upcoming elections.\"). \n3.  In  contrast to the  multi-step process required for  a driver using DPS's online \nsystems to update their voter registration, DPS's in-person driver's license applications, ECF No. \n93, exh. A-7, in-person renewal/replacement/change of address forms, ECF No. 93, exh. A-8, and \nmail in change of address forms, ECF No. 93, ex.

Defendants' current practices treat similarly situated voters differently based solely \non how those voters choose to transact with DPS without any adequate justification, in violation \nof the U.S. Constitution's requirement of equal protection. \n5.  Defendants  must  not  be  permitted  to  continue  to  ignore  constitutional  Jaw. \nIntervenor-Plaintiffs respectfully request that this Court enjoin Defendants from further violations \nof the law and grant the relief set forth below. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n6.  Intervenor-Plaintiffs  sue  under  42  U.S.C.  §  1983  and  1988  to  redress  the \ndeprivation under color of state law of rights secured by the United States  Constitution. \n7.  This Court has original jurisdiction over the subject of this action under 28 U.S.C. \n1331 and 1343 because the matters in controversy arise under the Constitution and laws of the \n§ \nUnited States. \n8.  This Court has personal jurisdiction over Defendants, who are citizens of the State \nof Texas and sued in their official capacity  only. \n9.  Venue is proper in this Court under 28 U.S.C. §  139 1(b) because a substantial part \nof the events that caused Intervenor-Plaintiffs' claims occurred in this judicial  district, and each \nDefendant conducts business in this district. \n10.  This  Court  has  the authority to  enter a  declaratory judgment  and to  provide \ninjunctive relief under Rules 57 and 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and 28 U.S.C. \n2201 and 2202. \n§ \nPARTIES \n11.  Plaintiff the  Texas  Democratic Party  (\"TDP\")  is  the  statewide  organization \nrepresenting Democratic candidates and voters throughout the State of Texas within the meaning \n3 \n\nCCaassee 5 5:2:106--ccvv--0000024567--OOLLGG     D Dooccuummeennt t8 163  7 F   ilFeidle 0d6 0/115/2/210/2  0 P   aPgaeg 6e7 4 o of f1 1520\nof Section 117 of Texas's Election Code and all other applicable provisions of the election laws. \nTDP's purpose is to elect Democratic Party candidates to public office throughout Texas. To \naccomplish  its  purpose,  TDP  engages  in  vitally  important  activities,  including  supporting \nDemocratic  Party  candidates  in  national,  state,  and  local  elections  through  ftindraising  and \norganizing; protecting the legal rights of voters; and ensuring that all voters have a meaningful \nability to cast ballots in Texas. TDP has millions of members and constituents from across Texas, \nincluding millions of Texans who are registered with the Texas Department of State's Division of \nElections as Democrats, millions of Texans who are drivers who interact with DPS, and many \nother Texans who regularly support and vote for candidates affiliated with the Democratic Party. \n12.  Plaintiff DSCC is the national senatorial committee of the Democratic Party, as \ndefined by 52 U.S.C.  30101(14), and its mission is to elect candidates of the Democratic Party \n§ \nto the United States Senate, including in Texas. DSCC works to accomplish its mission across the \ncountry  and in  Texas by, among  other things,  assisting state parties  throughout the  country, \nincluding in Texas.  In 2018, DSCC made contributions and expenditures in the tens of millions \nof dollars to persuade and mobilize voters to support Democratic Senate candidates.  In 2020, \nDSCC expects to invest millions in support of the Democratic candidate selected as the nominee \nto  run  against Republican  Senator  John  Comyn. Texas's  conduct  directly harms DSCC  by \nfrustrating its mission of, and efforts in, electing the Democratic Party candidate to the U.S. Senate \nin Texas by suppressing the access of eligible Texas citizens to the franchise. DSCC is aware of \nTexas's online portal system and will have to expend and divert additional funds and resources on \nensuring that eligible citizens are not misled into believing that they have effectively registered to \nvote, and are in fact registered to vote, as well as to support GOTV, voter persuasion efforts, and \n4 \n\nCCaassee 5 5:2:106--ccvv--0000024567--OOLLGG     D Dooccuummeennt t8 163  7 F   ilFeidle 0d6 0/115/2/210/2  0 P   aPgaeg 6e8 5 o of f1 1520\nother activities in Texas, at the expense of its other efforts to defeat Senator Cornyn, as well as its \nefforts in other states, to combat the effects of Texas's conduct. \n13.  Plaintiff DCCC is the national congressional committee of the Democratic Party, \nas defined by 52 U.S.C.  30101(14). DCCC's mission is electing Democratic candidates to the \n§ \nU.S. House of Representatives from congressional districts across the United States, including \nfrom Texas's 36 congressional districts. DCCC works to accomplish its mission across the country \nand in Texas by, among other things, assisting state parties throughout the country, including in \nTexas in its efforts to elect Democrats to public office.  Tn 2018, DCCC made contributions and \nexpenditures  in  the tens  of millions  of dollars  to persuade  and  mobilize  voters  to  support \nDemocratic  congressional  candidatesseveral million  dollars of which were  spent for those \npurposes in Texas. For 2020, DCCC has identified at least eight congressional districts in Texas \n(Congressional Districts 7, 10, 21, 22, 23, 24, 31, and 32) as targeted races, in which it will expend \nresources to support the  Democratic candidate, including  specifically through expenditures on \nvoter registration efforts. Overall, in 2020, DCCC expects to make contributions and expenditures \nin the millions of dollars to persuade and mobilize voters to support Democratic candidates in \ncongressional  elections  around the country, including  in Texas.  Defendants' conduct  directly \nharms DCCC by forcing DCCC to spend additional money on voter registration instead of other \ncritical priorities. Defendants' conduct also frustrates DCCC mission of, and efforts in, electing \nDemocratic Party candidates to the U.S. Congress in Texas by suppressing the access of eligible \nTexas citizens to the franchise. DCCC is aware of Texas's unconstitutional online portal system \nand will have to expend and divert additional funds and resources on voter registration and on \nensuring that eligible citizens are not misled into believing that they have effectively registered to \nvote when they have not. Additional resources will need to be allocated to these efforts at the \n5 \n\nCCaassee 5 5:2:106--ccvv--0000024567--OOLLGG     D Dooccuummeennt t8 163  7 F   ilFeidle 0d6 0/115/2/210/2  0 P   aPgaeg 6e9 6 o of f1 1520\nexpense of DCCC's other efforts to elect Democrats to Congress from Texas, as well as its efforts \nin other states, in order to combat the effects of Defendants' conduct. \n14.  Defendant RUTH HUGHS is sued in her official capacity as the Secretary of State \nof Texas. The Secretary is a person within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and acts under color \nof state law in her official capacity. The Secretary's official responsibilities include serving as the \nChief Election Officer for Texas, assisting county election officials and ensuring the uniform \napplication and interpretation of election  laws throughout Texas. See Tex. Elec.  Code Ann.  § \n31.001(a).  As the head  of the Elections  Division of her office, the Secretary is  charged with \nadministering the Texas Election Code. \n15.  Defendant STEVEN C.  MCCRAW is the Director of DPS,  and is sued  in his \nofficial capacity. DPS is Texas' motor vehicle bureau. DPS operates offices around the state, issues \ndriver's licenses and other state identification cards, and is responsible under state and federal law \nfor providing voter registration services and transmitting voter registration information to the \nTexas Secretary of State. See 52 U.S.C. §  20503-20504; Tex. Elec. Code Ann. §  20.063, 20.066. \nSTATEMENT OF FACTS AND LAW \nA. The Fourteenth Amendment \n16.  The Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause is implicated any time a \nstate subjects voters to disparate treatment or places arbitrary restrictions upon the right to vote. \nU.S. Const. amend. XIV, § 1. \n17.  There is no \"litmus test for measuring the severity of a burden that a state law \nimposes on.  an individual voter, or a discrete class of voters. However slight that burden may \n.  . \nappear,  it must be justified by relevant and legitimate state interests 'sufficiently weighty to \n.  .  . \njustiIi the limitation.\" Crawford v. Marion Cly. ElectionBd., 553 U.S. 181, 191 (2008) (Stevens, \n\nCCaassee 5 5:2:106--ccvv--0000024567--OOLLGG     D Dooccuummeennt t8 163  7 F   ilFeidle 0d6 0/115/2/210/2  0 P   aPgaeg 7e0 7 o of f1 1520\nJ., announcing judgment of Court); accord ObamaforAm. v. Husted, 697 F.3d 423, 429 (6th Cir. \n2012)  (\"When a plaintiff alleges that a state has burdened  voting rights through the disparate \ntreatment of voters,  we review the claim using the flexible standard outlined  in Anderson v. \nCelebrezze  courts must weigh the burden on voters against the state's asserted justifications \n.  .  . \nand make the hard judgment that our adversary system demands.\" (quotation marks and citations \nomitted)). \nB. Texas Election Code \n18.  Texas state law specifies that DPS must use \"a form and procedure that combines \nthe department's  application  form  for  a  license  or  card  with  an  officially prescribed  voter \nregistration application form.\" Tex. Elec. Code Ann. § 20.062(a). \n19.  DPS must also provide a \"change of address form and procedure that combines \ndepartment and voter registration functions,\" id. § 20.062(b), so that when a voter submits a change \nof address, that \"serves as a change of address for voter registration\" as well, unless the individual \nindicates otherwise. Id.  20.063(c). \n§ \n20.  In addition, if a \"correct driver's license number or personal identification card \nnumber\" or  if \"correct residence address or mailing address\"  information  is  missing from  a \nregistration  application,  DPS  employees  have  a  duty  to  correct  the  voter's  application  by \n\"enter[ing] the information on the application.\" Id. § 20.063(d). \n21.  Finally,  voter  registration  applications  and  change-of-address  forms  must  be \npromptly delivered to election officials. Specifically, \"[n]ot later than the fifth day after the date a \nperson completes  a voter registration  application and provides  an electronic  signature to  the \ndepartment, [DPS] shall electronically transfer the applicant's voter registration data, including the \napplicant's signature, to the [Texas Secretary of State].\" Id.  § 20.066(b); see also id. § 20.065. \n7 \n\nCCaassee 5 5:2:106--ccvv--0000024567--OOLLGG     D Dooccuummeennt t8 163  7 F   ilFeidle 0d6 0/115/2/210/2  0 P   aPgaeg 7e1 8 o of f1 1520\nC. DPS  does  not provide  simultaneous  voter  registration  with  online transactions \ndespite doing so with mail and in-person transactions \n22.  DPS's in-person driver's license applications, ECF No.  93,  exh. A-7,  in-person \nrenewal/replacement/change  of address forms, ECF No.  93, exh. A-8,  and mail in change-of- \naddress forms, ECF No. 93, ex. A-9, serve as simultaneous voter registration applications. \n23.  DPS encourages Texans to use a number of online services through its website, \nwww.txdps.state.tx.us,  an official governmental website for the State of Texas. \n24.  DPS invites  many Texas driver's license holders to renew their license and/or \nupdate the address information associated with their license online through a portion of its website \nentitled \"Driver License Renewal, Replacement, Change of Address or Change of Emergency \nContacts,\" available at https ://txapps.texas.gov/tolapp/txdl/. \n25.  This website page provides a single online portal for qualified holders of a Texas \ndriver's license to renew their driver's licenses, update the address listed on their driver's licenses, \nor both. \n26.  The online process involves nine \"Steps to Complete,\" including the following \nsteps: Welcome, Login, Select Services, Enter Address, Select Options, Review Order, Submit \nPayment, Emergency Contacts, and Receipt. \n27.  Unlike Defendants' simultaneous voter registration services for license renewal or \naddress update applications submitted in-person at a DPS office or through the mail, Defendants \ndo not provide for simultaneous voter registration at any point during the online license renewal \nor  address  update  process.  Instead  of providing  any  simultaneous  opportunity  for  voter \nregistration, the DPS website directs voters to an entirely different website, where voters must \ncomplete an online application, print it out, sign it, and mail it to their county voter registrar to \nensure their ability to vote in upcoming elections. \n8 \n\nCCaassee 5 5:2:106--ccvv--0000024567--OOLLGG     D Dooccuummeennt t8 163  7 F   ilFeidle 0d6 0/115/2/210/2  0 P   aPgaeg 7e2 9 o of f1 1520\n28.  Even though Defendants refuse to use information from online change-of-address \ntransactions to properly register voters at their new addresses, they are certainly capable of using \nthis information to do so. In fact, Defendants may use the same online information to cancel a \nvoter's prior registration record even though they fail to give voters any notice of this possibility. \nSee Tex. Elec. Code Ann. § 16.03 1. \nD. Defendants' Voter Registration Failures Harm Countless Texas Voters \n29.  As  a result of Defendants'  failure to register eligible voters equally,  countless \neligible Texas residents have been denied the right to voter registration. \n30.  According  to  data  already  in  the  factual  record  before  this  Court,  between \nSeptember 2013  and February 2015, the Secretary's Elections Division confirmed over 1,700 \nincidents reported by voters who checked \"yes\" on their drivers'  license applications at DPS, \nindicating they wanted to register to vote at that time, but did not appear on the voter rolls. ECF \nNo. 1-4 at 7. \n31.  The voters who complained almost certainly represent just a fraction of the total \naffected during that time frame. Indeed, the State's records capture only those voters who contacted \nelection workers, specifically complained about registration problems at DPS, and had their files \ninvestigated  surely, not all affected voters complained; others may have reported problems but \nhad their complaints disregarded by election workers. Further, this data comes from just 123 of \nTexas' 254 counties, strongly suggesting that the data set itself is incomplete. See ECF No. 1-3; \nECF No. 1-4 at 9. \n\nCCaassee  55::1260--ccvv--0000205476--OOLLGG      DDooccuummeenntt  18367    F  Fileiledd 0 061/1/251/2/200    P  Paaggee 7 130 o of 1f 1520\nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nCOUNT I \nViolation of Fourteenth Amendment: Disparate Treatment \nU.S. Const. amend.

By arbitrarily subjecting eligible voters to disparate voter registration standards, \nDefendants have denied voters an equal opportunity to participate in federal and state elections in \nviolation of Section  of the Fourteenth Amendment. As a result of this disparate treatment, \n1 \nIntervenor-Plaintiffs were directly harmed in their mission to elect Democratic representatives, \nand those among their membership harmed through disenfranchisement. \n34.  No legitimate state interest could justify the state's differential treatment, which \ncreates arbitrary distinctions among Texas voters based on how they choose to interact with DPS. \n35.  Absent relief, DSCC, DCCC, and TDP along with its members and constituents, \nwill be denied an equal opportunity to participate in Texas's elections. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Intervenor-Plaintiffs respectfully request this Court enter judgment: \n(a)  declaring,  under the authority  granted to this  Court by 28 U.S.C.  § 2201, that \nDefendants have violated Section  of the Fourteenth  Amendment by denying \n1 \nvoters an equal opportunity to participate in federal and state elections; \n(b)  permanently  enjoining Defendants, their respective agents, officers, employees, \nand successors, and all persons acting in concert with each or any of them, from \nimplementing practices  and procedures  that  likewise  violate  Section  1  of the \nFourteenth Amendment; \n(c)  directing Defendants, under a court-approved plan with appropriate reporting and \nmonitoring requirements, to take all appropriate measures necessary to remedy the \nharm  caused by their violation, including, but not  limited to providing  for the \nelectronic  transfer  of voter  registration  information  collected  through  online \ntransactions to the Secretary of State, similar to the existing system to transfer voter \nregistration information collected through in-person transactions; \n10 \n\nCCaassee  55::1260--ccvv--0000205476--OOLLGG      DDooccuummeenntt  18367    F  Fileiledd 0 061/1/251/2/200    P  Paaggee 7 141 o of 1f 1520\n(d)  awarding Intervenor-Plaintiffs their costs, disbursements, and reasonable attorneys' \nfees incurred in bringing this action under 42 U.S.C. § 1988 and other applicable \nlaws; \n(e)  retaining jurisdiction over this action to ensure that Defendants continue to comply \nwith their obligations under Section  of the Fourteenth Amendment; and \n1 \n(f)  granting such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper. \nDated: December 20, 2019.

Soon after the approval of two articles of impeachment by the \nDemocrat-controlled House of Representatives in December, top Republicans in the Senate signaled that \nthey would  to subpoena new witnesses and documents in the trial phase, a significant \ndeparture from previous impeachment proceedings. Gardner voted to defeat eleven Democratic proposals to \ncall witnesses and obtain documents from the Trump administration on January 21, and with a final vote on \ntrial procedure expected within the next few days, has appeared unlikely to break with the GOP majority. \n\"We've heard a lot of impeachment witnesses,\" Gardner told reporters on Capitol Hill last week, just before \na  spared him from further questions. \nAspen Daily News:============= \nWe are writing to you as local elected officials in Colorado. As such, we share representation with you for \ncitizens throughout the State. Along with many in the United States, we are closely watching the Senate \nImpeachment trial of Mr. Trump. As local elected officials we have a duty and a legal requirement to conduct \nour governing business as transparently as possible. We urge you to demand transparency as a top priority \nduring the Senate Impeachment trial. Our shared constituents have a right to see our elected officials conduct \ntheir business. The heightened importance of this process with respect to the stability of our democracy \nmakes transparency critical.  As local decision makers we must ensure that we have all relevant information \navailable to us before we make a decision that will affect our constituents. Any evidence related to the Articles \nof Impeachment, including the testimony of Ambassador John Bolton, must be made available to the members \nof the Senate so that you can make an informed decision. Again, the heightened importance of this process \nmakes the provision of any relevant evidence critical. \nNYTimes (Opinion): =~=!-1-.=~=~::-::.::.==::;::;.i. \nBy David Leonhardt \nPresident Trump lost Colorado by 5 percentage points in 2016, and he's on pace to lose it by more this year. \nHis most recent approval rating there was 39 percent, according to  His unpopularity creates \na problem for Cory Gardner, a first-term Republican senator from Colorado, who will be running for re-election \nthis year - which makes Gardner's behavior during the impeachment trial especially striking. Rather than act \nas the senator he is, with his own power to shape events, Gardner has served as a Trump loyalist. Gardner \nhas not expressed skepticism about the obvious lies Trump's lawyers are telling. Gardner doesn't seem \nconcerned about Trump perverting foreign policy for his own personal interests. And Gardner has shown no \ninterest in hearing all the relevant evidence by calling witnesses to testify. We now know that John Bolton, \nTrump's former national security adviser, heard the president demand the precise quid pro quo that he has \nsince denied. For Bolton to be called to testify, however, at least four Republican senators would have to join \nwith the 47 Democrats and independents to create a majority. \nAtlanta Journal Constitution:==~======~~=============~~ \nBy Maya T.

John Cornyn and Ted Cruz, like many other GOP jurors in the ongoing trial, rejected the need to \nput Bolton under oath despite a report that his forthcoming memoir recounts in detail that Trump froze military \naid to pressure Ukraine to dig for dirt on the Bidens. \nBut a handful of GOP senators were working behind the scenes - when they weren't stuck at their desks \nDSCC_000064 \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 86   Filed 06/15/20   Page 146 of 150\nwithout access to electronics - on a deal that could bring both Hunter Biden and Bolton to the trial as part of a \none-for-one deal on witnesses sought by each side. \nBolton's account, which surfaced Sunday, ramped up pressure on Republican senators to allow witnesses and \nhung over the trial throughout the day Monday as the Trump team continued to deliver its case. \nKen Starr, the special counsel whose investigation of Bill Clinton led to the last presidential impeachment, in \n1998, asserted that \"tragically,\" the effort to remove Trump is an unjustified, partisan effort from a \"runaway \nHouse.\" \nThe former law school dean and Baylor University president argued that impeachment should be a \"once in a \ncentury phenomenon,\" pursued only with bipartisan support, when a specific crime is alleged, as \"truly a \nmeasure of last resort,\" and not during an election year when voters could soon pass judgment on a president's \nconduct. \nAlthough we won't vote on additional witnesses in impeachment trial until Friday, House managers need to \nknow that both sides will have same chance to identify potential witnesses to call. Obvious choices are Adam \nSchiff, Joe Biden and Hunter Biden for starters. \nBolton's allegations go to the heart of abuse of power allegations in the first article of impeachment. His \ntestimony would provide behind-the-scenes insight into Trump's statements and motives that Trump's \ndefenders have insisted were missing from the House inquiry. \nHouse managers blame that gap on Trump, for ordering Bolton, acting White House chief of staff Mick \nMulvaney, then Energy Secretary Rick Perry and every other member of his administration not to cooperate. \n\"The press loves to obsess over the latest bombshell,'' Cruz said during a break in the trial. \"I don't know what \nJohn Bolton's book says or doesn't say ... but at the end of the day, it doesn't impact the legal issue before this \nSenate\" which is \"whether the president has the authority to investigate corruption.\" \nHe reiterated his demand for testimony from Hunter Biden but flat-out rejected the need to put Bolton under \noath, calling whatever he has to say irrelevant - an assertion that Democrats vehemently dispute. \n\"I don't believe the testimony is necessary,'' Cruz said. \nThe New York Times reported the contents of Bolton's memoir on Sunday night, triggering the fresh frenzy \nover whether he should testify - and recriminations from Trump and his defenders, who cast it as an attempt to \ndistract from the defense case. \nIn a prime-time presentation Monday night, famed Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz hit head-on the \nallegations that his colleagues on the defense team had ignored all day. \n\"Nothing in the Bolton revelations, even if true, would rise to the level of an abuse of power or an impeachable \noffense,\" Dershowitz told senators during an erudite review of the history and jurisprudence of impeachment. \nHe challenged senators to apply a \"shoe on the other foot\" test, and assess whether they would feel the same \nway if the allegations were leveled against a president of the other party. And he maintained that he would \nreject the House charges without regard to his views of Trump. \nGOP senators crowded around him after the session to thank and congratulate him on acompelling presentation. \nI NEVER told John Bolton that the aid to Ukraine was tied to investigations into Democrats, including the \nDSCC_000065 \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 86   Filed 06/15/20   Page 147 of 150\nBidens. In fact, he never complained about this at the time of his very public termination. If John Bolton said \nthis, it was only to sell a book. With that being said, the ... \n\"The timing is a little interesting, isn't it?\" Cornyn said on Fox News, shrugging off Bolton's allegations as old \nnews. \"It's nothing different than what we've already heard. No crimes were alleged, and these events never \nactually occurred - the withholding of aid and the investigation.\" \nCornyn complained that if the Senate were to subpoena witnesses, the cloud and distraction of impeachment \nwould linger for months as the issue plays out in court. \n\"It goes on forever and ever and ever,\" Comyn said. \nBolton reportedly writes that he tried to talk Trump out of withholding military aid to Ukraine, and that Trump \nrefused to let go of a belief, debunked by the U.S. intelligence community, that Ukraine meddled in the 2016 \nelection. \nTrump, in the Oval Office with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, insisted that Bolton's claims are \n\"totally false.\" \nTrump's case \nTrump lawyer Jay Sekulow reminded senators that Speaker Nancy Pelosi used numerous pens to sign the \nformal articles of impeachment, and handed them as souvenirs to key players in the House inquiry - an \nunseemly display of gloating and partisanship, he said. \nWithout mentioning Bolton, he seemed to shrug off the revelations: \"We do not deal with speculation.\" \nDemocrats marveled at the defense team's ability to ignore the elephant in the room. \n\"This session was surreal,\" said Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn. \"The rest of America is talking about John \nBolton .... This bombshell has just struck .... The White House lawyers are in a bubble of denial.\" \nInside the Senate, the focus was indeed elsewhere for most of the day. \nAs expected, the defense sought to put Biden on trial, hoping to dispel the allegation that Trump abused his \noffice in seeking a corruption probe from Ukraine aimed at the Bidens. \nIf they could show that Trump had good reason to believe that Biden himself had acted corruptly - by \npressuring Ukraine's government to fire a prosecutor who was investigating Burisma, an energy company that \nhad hired his son Hunter Biden - that would refute the House managers' allegations. \nPam Bondi, a former Florida attorney general, led senators through the argument on behalf of the president, \nnoting that the accusers invoked Biden or Burisma over 400 times in their presentation last week. \n\"They say sham. They say baseless.\" But she said, \"This is fiction.\" \nTrump's team also focused at Barack Obama, arguing that under the House Democrats' view of impeachment \npower, he committed a far more egregious offense that Trump in 2012, when he was caught on a hot mic telling \nRussian President Dmitri Medvedev that he would have more flexibility to negotiate on missile defense after his \nreelection. \nDeputy White House counsel Patrick Philbin took aim at Article 2 of the impeachment, which accuses Trump of \nDSCC_000066 \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 86   Filed 06/15/20   Page 148 of 150\nobstructing Congress by refusing to cooperate with the House inquiry. \nHouse managers argued last week that if a president can stymie an investigation of his own misdeeds, the \nConstitution's impeachment clause has no teeth. \nIf that argument prevails, Philbin asserted, presidents could be impeached for withholding any information from \nCongress. \n\"Virtually every president has asserted at one time or another these constitutional prerogatives,\" he said. \nRepublican senators seized on the defense team's discussion of Hunter Biden and Burisma as irrefutable proof \nthat Trump did not abuse his office. \n\"The White House counsel has done a brilliant job in really shredding the House managers' case,\" Iowa Sen. \nJoni Ernst said. \nPossible deal on witnesses \nUtah Sen. Mitt Romney, a rare GOP voice for calling Bolton to testify, told reporters that with the new \nrevelations, \"it's increasingly likely that other Republicans will join those of us who think we should hear from \nJohn Bolton.\" \nSen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., was reportedly leading an effort to hammer out a witness swap. \nThe defense team used two hours of its 24-hour allotment on Saturday, and has until Tuesday night to finish its \npresentation. The next two days will be devoted to written questions from senators, with a decision expected \nFriday on whether to move to a vote on conviction or acquittal. \nIf witnesses are called, the Senate likely would conduct depositions first, prolonging the trial by days or weeks. \nIt takes a two-thirds vote to remove a president from office. Republicans control 53 seats. \nRep. John Ratcliffe, R-Heath, part of the president's defense team -House members who provide off-the-floor \nadvice and advocate his case for the cameras - likewise shrugged off the Bolton allegations. \n\"The president said it's not true. The attorney general has come out today and said specifically, it's not true,\" \nRatcliffe said. \"Every time things don't go the Democrats' way, they try to change the narrative and selectively \nleak information.\" \nHe and other Trump defenders sidestepped the issue of whether Bolton's knowledge is relevant to the case \nagainst the president, focusing on the claim that it's too late because the House didn't force him to testify before \napproving articles of impeachment. \n\"The president ordered everyone with first-hand knowledge of his actions not to testify,\" Minority Leader \nChuck Schumer said, accusing any senator who votes against ordering testimony from Bolton of being an \naccomplice to a cover-up. \nRep. Adam Schiff, the lead prosecutor for the House, noted that Bolton had refused to testify before the House. \n\"We would still be in court trying to get John Bolton's testimony ... but at the end of the day the senators \ncannot hide from a relevant witness who has come forward willing to testify,\" he said, accusing the White \nHouse of trying to suppress Bolton's manuscript, noting that he submitted it for review a month ago. \nDSCC_000067 \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 86   Filed 06/15/20   Page 149 of 150\nSen. John Kennedy, R-La., said the allegations would be more credible from someone other than Bolton, who \nwas forced from his post and is now peddling a book. He counseled medically-assisted patience before asking \nthe Senate to decide about witnesses. \n\"I think everybody ought to pop a Zoloft, take their meds and let's wait,\" Kennedy said. \n1/27 Cornyn: Bolton Revelations 'Nothing Different Than What We've Already Heard' by JEFF POOR \n[Breitbart] \nMonday during an appearance on Fox News, Sen. John Comyn (R-TX) dismissed the so-called bombshell \nrevelations in former National Security Advisor John Bolton's forthcoming book, as reported by The New York \nTimes. \nComyn pointed to the timing but said nothing changed in his view from what has already been put forth. \n\"Yes, the timing is a little interesting, isn't it?\" he said. on \"Fox & Friends.\" \"But the best I can tell from what's \nreported in The New York Times - it's nothing different than what we've already heard. And as I said, the -\nno crimes were alleged and these events never actually occurred, the withholding of aid and the investigations. \nSo it's - I'm trying to get my head around exactly what is the impeachment manager's theory of the case and \nwhy they should provoke this constitutional crisis.\" \n1/27 Largest Texas labor union backs progressive Cisneros over incumbent Rep.

R. Evid. 201(b)(2). Courts routinely take judicial notice of \ninformation contained on government websites. See Kitty Hawk Aircargo, Inc. v. Chao, 418 F.3d \n453, 457 (5th Cir. 2005) (taking judicial notice of representation on agency website); Coleman v. \nDretke, 409 F.3d 665, 667 (5th Cir. 2005) (taking judicial notice of Texas state agency’s website); \nsee also United States v. Garcia, 855 F.3d 615, 621-22 (4th Cir. 2017) (holding that district court \n2 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 6   Filed 01/17/20   Page 3 of 5\ndid not abuse its discretion in taking judicial notice of information on USCIC  website). Moreover, \ncourts may take judicial notice of government website information that is admissible under the \npublic records exception to the hearsay rule. Fed. R. Evid. 803(8); see, e.g., Kew v. Bank of Am., \nN.A., No. CIV.A. H-11-2824, 2012 WL 1414978, at *3 n.4 (S.D. Tex. Apr. 23, 2012) (holding that \na printout from the Harris County Appraisal district’s website was a public record under Rule \n803(8) and that the court could take judicial notice of the same).  Likewise, “United States census \ndata is an appropriate and frequent subject of judicial notice.” Hollinger v. Home State Mut. Ins. \nCo., 654 F.3d 564, 571–72 (5th Cir. 2011) (considering census data related to the rate at which \npeople move from Texas to another state). \nJudicial notice expedites proceedings by simplifying the process of proving matters on \nwhich there can be no reasonable dispute. “When a party requests that the Court take judicial notice \nof a fact and supplies it with the necessary information, the Federal Rules of Evidence provide that \nthe Court must judicially notice the fact in question.” Cleven v. Mid-Am. Apartment Communities, \nInc., No. 1:16-CV-820-RP, 2017 WL 4276534, at *3 (W.D. Tex. Sept. 26, 2017) (citing Fed. R. \nEvid. 201(b)).  Here, the accuracy of Defendants’ own web pages and commonly available census \ndata cannot be reasonably questioned. Recognizing this, the District Court previously took judicial \nnotice of these exact or previous versions of these materials in an earlier, related case.  See Stringer \nI, No. 5:16-cv-00257-OLG at Doc. #104 (W.D. Tex. Apr. 26, 2018) (order). \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs respectfully request this Court take judicial notice of \nattachments A-1 through A-11 and the content therein. \nDated: January 17, 2020        Respectfully submitted,  \n  \n /s/___Rebecca Harrison Stevens________   \n3 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 6   Filed 01/17/20   Page 4 of 5\nMimi Marziani \nTexas Bar No. 24091906 \nmimi@texascivilrightsproject.org \nRebecca Harrison Stevens \nTexas Bar No. 24065381 \nbeth@texascivilrightsproject.org \nHani Mirza \nTexas Bar No. 24083512 \nhani@texascivilrightsproject.org \nRyan Cox \nTexas Bar No. 24074087 \nryan@texascivilrightsproject.org \nJoaquin Gonzalez* \nTexas Bar No. 24109935  \njoaquin@texascivilrightsproject.org  \n \nTEXAS CIVIL RIGHTS PROJECT \n1405 Montopolis Drive \nAustin, Texas 78741 \nTel.

Plaintiffs’ Emergency Application for \nPreliminary Injunction, Doc. 5 (Jan. 17, 2020); Plaintiffs’ Supplementary Brief in Support of \nPreliminary Injunction, Doc. 69 (May 13, 2020); Order, Doc. 46 (Jan. 30, 2020). One issue relevant \nto the current proceeding is the imminence of injury to Plaintiff Stringer both for the purposes of \nestablishing standing and to demonstrate irreparable injury to warrant a preliminary injunction. \nAccordingly, Plaintiffs respectfully submit the attached Declaration of Plaintiff Jarrod Stringer and \nhis accompanying notice of non-renewal of lease which he submitted to his landlord on June 18, \n2020. Exhibit A. Mr. Stringer has previously testified as to his intent to move on or before the end \nof his current lease, which expires on August 24, 2020. See Excerpts of Apr. 29 Deposition of \nJarrod Stringer at 35:6–36:24, Doc. 69-1 at 72-73. The attached notice of non-renewal further \n1 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 91   Filed 06/29/20   Page 2 of 7\n \n \ndemonstrates that Mr. Stringer has concrete and imminent plans to move, and that he will once \nagain be in a position to update his driver’s license address online in the near future. Mr. Stringer \nhas also testified that he will once again update his driver’s license address online when he is in \nthe position to do so, and, if able, will simultaneously update his voter registration information. \nSee id. at 36:25-37:15, Doc. 69-1 at 73-74. These actions would be consistent with his past conduct, \nand all the more necessary due to the infeasibility of in-person transactions due to the COVID-19 \npandemic.  \nAs this Court is aware, Mr. Stringer has previously been injured on two separate occasions \nby Defendants’ refusal to offer simultaneous voter registration application opportunities with \nonline driver’s license transactions and has been forced into litigation to vindicate his rights. If \nthere is not a system in place for individuals to simultaneously apply to register to vote while \nconducting driver’s license transactions online, in compliance with the mandates of the National \nVoter  Registration  Act,  Mr.  Stringer  will  have  his  legal  rights  violated  for  a  third  time. \nAdditionally, the organizational and associational Plaintiffs in this case continue to experience \ndaily irreparable injury as a result of Defendants’ legal violations. Defendants have consistently \nindicated that they still believe substantial time may be required to completely finalize the \nremaining technological steps necessary to provide a simultaneous voter registration application \nexperience.  See  Defendants’  Supplemental  Brief  in  Opposition  to  Plaintiffs’  and  Plaintiff-\nIntervenors’ Request for Preliminary Injunction at 12-13, Doc. 74 (May 22, 2020). Therefore, \nPlaintiffs offer this additional information to support the standing and irreparable injury faced by \nMr. Stringer, and respectfully urge consideration of their request for a preliminary injunction with \nrelief granted as soon as practicable and in any event with sufficient time such that Plaintiff \nStringer will be fully able to exercise his legal right to simultaneously change his voter registration \n2 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 91   Filed 06/29/20   Page 3 of 7\n \n \naddress while updating his driver’s license address online when he moves on or before August 24, \n2020. \n \nDated: June 29, 2020       Respectfully submitted,  \n  \n /s/ Mimi Marziani \nMimi Marziani \nTexas Bar No. 24091906 \nmimi@texascivilrightsproject.org  \nHani Mirza \nTexas Bar No. 24083512 \nhani@texascivilrightsproject.org \nRyan Cox \nTexas Bar No. 24074087 \nryan@texascivilrightsproject.org \nJoaquin Gonzalez \nTexas Bar No. 24109935  \nJoaquin@texascivilrightsproject.org  \n \nTEXAS CIVIL RIGHTS PROJECT \n1405 Montopolis Drive \nAustin, Texas 78741 \nTel.

      "text": "Case 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 86   Filed 07/28/17   Page 1 of 23\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS \nSAN ANTONIO DIVISION \n \nJARROD STRINGER, et al.,    § \n  Plaintiffs,  § \n  § \nV.  §   NO. 5:16-CV-00257 \n  § \nROLANDO PABLOS, IN HIS OFFICIAL CAPACITY  § \nAS THE TEXAS SECRETARY OF STATE AND  § \nSTEVEN C. MCCRAW, IN HIS OFFICIAL CAPACITY  § \nAS THE DIRECTOR OF THE TEXAS DEPARTMENT OF § \nPUBLIC SAFETY,  § \nDefendants.  § \n \n \nDEFENDANTS’ RESPONSE TO PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT1 \n \n \nPlaintiffs cannot meet their summary judgment burden under either the NVRA or the Equal \nProtection Clause. Rather, as set forth in Defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment, Doc. 82, all \nof Plaintiffs’ claims fail as a matter of law. The Court should deny Plaintiffs’ Motion for Summary \nJudgment, Doc. 77, and enter summary judgment in Defendants’ favor on all claims. \nRESPONSE TO PLAINTIFFS’ STATEMENT OF FACTS2 \nThis case arises from Plaintiffs’ insistence that Defendants violate Texas election laws (which \nPlaintiffs do not challenge) in their administration of the federal National Voter Registration Act \n(which can be applied harmoniously therewith). Understanding these provisions of Texas law is \nessential to properly assessing this case, yet they are absent from the statement of facts in Plaintiffs’ \nsummary judgment motion. Defendants, therefore, begin by explaining those provisions. \n                                                 \n1 Defendants file this 22 page Response subject to Doc. 83, their July 21, 2017 Motion for Leave to Exceed Page Limit. \n2 Defendants note that the “Preliminary Statement” and “Background” sections of Plaintiffs’ summary judgment motion \nare rife with unsupported assertions. Doc. 77 at 1-4. To the extent they cite authority or evidence, these sections are \nfrequently incomplete and misleading. For these reasons, the “Preliminary Statement” and “Background” portions of \nPlaintiffs’ summary judgment motion should not be relied upon in disposing of the same. Ragas v. Tenn. Gas Pipeline \nCo., 136 F.3d 455, 458 (5th Cir. 1998) (“[U]nsubstantiated assertions are not competent summary judgment evidence.”). \n1 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 86   Filed 07/28/17   Page 2 of 23\nIt provides helpful context to consider that, in Texas, voter rolls are maintained by counties. \nE.g., TEX. ELEC. CODE §12.001 et seq.. Each county voter registrar must “maintain a file containing \nthe approved registration applications of the registered voters of the county,” and “[e]ach application \nshall be retained on file during the time the registration is effective.” Id. §13.101(a), (c). “A person \ndesiring to register to vote must submit an application to the registrar of the county in which the \nperson resides,” and such “registration application must be in writing and signed by the applicant.” \nId. §13.002(a), (b). Changes to voter registration information, too, typically must be in writing and \nsigned by the voter when he requests the change. In particular, “[i]f a voter discovers incorrect \ninformation on the voter’s registration certificate or if any of the information becomes incorrect \nbecause of a change in circumstances, the voter shall promptly submit to the registrar a written, signed \nnotice of the incorrect information and the corresponding correction.” TEX. ELEC. CODE §15.021(a). \nThe sole exception applies to a voter changing his address within a county: “[a] voter who continues \nto reside in the county in which the voter is registered may correct information under this section by \ndigital transmission of the information under a program administered by the secretary of state and the \nDepartment of Information Resources.” Id. §15.021(d). \nThus, in framing this case, it is helpful to think about inter-county changes to voter registration \ninformation as new applications for voter registration, in the sense that voter rolls are maintained at \nthe county level, and each county must maintain an approved voter registration application on file for \neach registered voter. E.g., id. §13.101. And, as set forth above, Texas law requires that original \napplications for voter registration—as well as any requests to change that information that are not \nsubject to a statutory exception—be made in writing and signed by the applicant in order to be valid. \nId. §§13.002(a), (b). Plaintiffs have not argued or put on evidence that anything about these statutory \nrequirements—or their exception—violates the Equal Protection Clause or the NVRA. \nMoreover, though Defendants need not justify Texas’s “in writing and signed” requirement, \n2 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 86   Filed 07/28/17   Page 3 of 23\nthese provisions, among other things, allow counties to fulfill their obligation to maintain copies of \nvoter registration applications of all active voters. TEX. ELEC. CODE §13.101(a), (c); §15.021(a). The \nexception for changes of address within a single county in Election Code §15.021(d), makes sense, \ngiven this backdrop—the county in question already has received an original, signed application from \nthe individual changing his address. See id. §13.002(1); cf. id. §15.021.3  \nTo implement the NVRA, Texas law requires that DPS field offices “shall provide to each \nperson who applies in person at the department’s offices for an original or renewal of a driver’s \nlicense, a personal identification card, or a duplicate or corrected license or card an opportunity to \ncomplete a voter registration application form.” TEX. ELEC. CODE §20.063(a). “When the department \nprocesses a license or card for renewal by mail, the department shall deliver to the applicant by mail \na voter registration application form.” Id. §20.063(b). “A change of address that relates to a license \nor card and that is submitted to the department in person or by mail serves as a change of address for \nvoter  registration  unless  the  licensee  or  cardholder  indicates  that  the  change  is  not  for  voter \nregistration purposes.” Id. §20.063(c).  \nIn person and mail applications are completed in writing and signed, then submitted to the \nCSR, or by post, respectively, by the individual who wants to register or update his registration \ninformation. Ingram Depo. 99:7-99:24; Schonhoff Depo. 101:3 – 15; 102:20-21; 119:19-120:15; \n123:24-124:5.4 For applications governed by §20.063 in particular, “[i]f a person completes a voter \nregistration application as provided by [§]20.063, the [DPS] shall input the information provided on \nthe application into the department’s electronic data system; and inform the applicant that the \n                                                 \n3 The NVRA acknowledges (in the context of list maintenance) that there is a difference between changes to voter \nregistration information within a single jurisdiction, and changes made from one jurisdiction to another. 52 U.S.C. \n§20507(f) (“Change of voting address within a jurisdiction. In the case of a change of address, for voting purposes, of a \nregistrant to another address within the same registrar’s jurisdiction, the registrar shall correct the voting registration list \naccordingly, and the registrant’s name may not be removed from the official list of eligible voters by reason of such a \nchange of address except as provided in subsection (d).”) \n4 Deposition citations herein refer to the proof filed with Defendants’ summary judgment motion, Doc. 82-1. \n3 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 86   Filed 07/28/17   Page 4 of 23\napplicant’s electronic signature provided to the department will be used for submitting the applicant’s \nvoter registration application.” TEX. ELEC. CODE §20.066(a). The legislature granted SOS authority \nto “prescribe additional procedures as necessary to implement this section.” Id. §20.066(c). See also \nIngram Depo. 99:25-100:3; 97:4-98:5; Schonhoff Depo. 49:10-14. \nBut unlike an in person or mail driver license applicant, an online customer does not provide \na physical signature—either in ink, or for electronic capture using a stylus—over the internet. Ingram \nDepo. 99:25-100:3; Ingram Depo. 97:4-98:5; Schonhoff Depo. 49:10-14. And Texas law does not \nauthorize  DPS  to  use  a  physical  signature  electronically  captured  on  a  previous  occasion  for \nsubmitting an applicant’s voter registration application when an individual changes his address or \nrenews online. Cf. TEX. ELEC. CODE §§20.066(a); 20.066. As a result, to comply with Texas Election \nCode §§13.002 and 15.021, online driver license transactions in which an applicant wants to register \nto vote or change voter registration information provide a voter registration application for the \napplicant to sign and submit. In this way, these transactions can be effected “in accordance with State \nlaw,” as the NVRA requires. 52 U.S.C. §20504(d). \nPlaintiffs do not contest that these are the requirements of Texas law. Rather, they contend \nthat, in their view, it would be more expedient if Defendants ignored them. This does not provide a \nbasis to enter summary judgment in their favor on any claim here. \nARGUMENT AND AUTHORITY \nI.  The record shows that the Court lacks jurisdiction, and should therefore enter judgment as \na matter of law in Defendants’ favor. \n \nAs a threshold matter, Plaintiffs have not demonstrated standing to assert any of their claims, \nas required for the Court to exercise jurisdiction. To establish standing, Plaintiffs must prove that they \nhave validly invoked the limited waiver of immunity that Congress provided for under the NVRA, \nand also must satisfy the remaining elements of Article III standing. They fail in both respects. \n4 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 86   Filed 07/28/17   Page 5 of 23\nA.  The Court lacks jurisdiction because Plaintiffs have failed to validly invoke the \nNVRA’s limited waiver of immunity, and they lack statutory standing. \n \nThe Eleventh Amendment bars official capacity suits against state officials in federal court \nabsent a valid waiver of immunity. U.S. CONST. amend. XI; Pennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. v. \nHalderman, 465 U.S. 89, 102 (1984); Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S. 651, 663-69 (1974). Under the \nnarrow Ex parte Young exception to immunity a federal court may, consistent with the Eleventh \nAmendment, enjoin state officials to conform their future conduct to requirements of federal law.5 \nPennhurst, 465 U.S. at 102-103; Quern v. Jordan, 440 U.S. 332, 337 (1979). The relief that may be \nawarded under Young is limited to prospective injunctive relief from an ongoing violation of federal \nlaw. Edelman, 415 U.S. at 666–69, 677 (retroactive relief barred by Eleventh Amendment).6 \n“Where Congress has prescribed a detailed remedial scheme for the enforcement against a \nState of a statutorily created right, a court should hesitate before casting aside those limitations and \npermitting an action against a state officer based upon Ex parte Young.” Seminole Tribe v. Fla., 517 \nU.S. 44, 74 (1996). Where Congress has created such remedial scheme, courts lack jurisdiction under \nEx parte Young unless the statute contains an “explicit reference to the Eleventh Amendment,” and \n“clearly indicates that Congress specifically intended to permit suits against states within the bounds \nof the Amendment.” Cox v. City of Dallas, 256 F.3d 281, 309 (5th Cir. 2001) (citations omitted). The \nFifth Circuit has recognized the NVRA as a statute which, “‘itself, provides an exclusive remedy for \nviolations of its own terms,’” and is therefore not subject to an exercise of jurisdiction under Young. \nACORN v. Fowler, 178 F.3d 350, 367 n.11 (5th Cir. 1999) (citations omitted). \nThe substance of the NVRA’s remedial scheme confirms this. Congress waived immunity for \n                                                 \n5 Moreover, for the reasons in Defendants’ summary judgment motion, and those here, the record demonstrates that no \nongoing violation of Federal law exists here. Doc. 82 at 20-24. \n6 And, although Plaintiffs do not challenge any provision of Texas law, it is worth noting that the Ex parte Young exception \nto immunity does not apply to claims against a state on the basis of state law. Pennhurst, 465 U.S. at 103-06 \n5 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 86   Filed 07/28/17   Page 6 of 23\nNVRA suits against state officials filed by the United States Attorney General. 52 U.S.C. §20510(a). \nBut it provided for private causes of action only under the following circumstances: \n [a] person who is aggrieved by a violation of this chapter may provide written notice \nof the violation to the chief election official of the State involved. If the violation is \nnot corrected within 90 days after receipt of a notice…the aggrieved person may bring \na civil action in an appropriate district court for declaratory or injunctive relief with \nrespect to the violation. \n \nId. §20510(b)(1)-(2) (emphasis supplied).7 Unless the requirements of notice and an opportunity to \ncure are satisfied, the NVRA does not waive state official immunity to lawsuits by private plaintiffs. \nThe summary judgment record proves that Plaintiffs do not meet this standard here, because any \nNVRA violation by which they claim to have been aggrieved was cured within the notice period. \nThe Fifth Circuit’s ruling in Scott v. Schedler, a challenge to Louisiana’s implementation of \nan NVRA requirement applicable to public assistance agencies, is instructive in this standing context. \n771 F.3d 831, 840 (5th Cir. 2014). There, the Court held that, to confer standing to bring a private \ncause  of  action,  putative  notice  had  to  “provide  Scheduler  with  ‘an  opportunity  to  attempt \ncompliance’ as to Scott ‘before facing litigation.” 771 F.3d at 836 (quoting ACORN v. Miller, 129 \nF.3d 833 (6th Cir. 1997)). The Court found Scott’s attempted notice insufficient to allow the State \nthe required opportunity to cure, which was “fatal to his suit.” Id. at 836. The Court went on to note \nthat, even if Scott had provided proper notice, the State had “attempted to provide Scott with voter \nregistration forms,” which was “‘exactly’” what the “‘pre-litigation notice was meant to encourage.’” \nId. at 836 (quoting Ga. State Conf. of NAACP v. Kemp, 841 F.Supp.2d 1320, 1336 (N.D. Ga. 2012)). \nThis two-pronged test was also applied in Georgia State Conference of NAACP v. Kemp, \nwhere the court found that a plaintiff lacked standing because—upon receipt of notice—“Georgia \nha[d] attempted to comply with” the relevant NVRA provisions “insofar as [the given plaintiff] was \n                                                 \n7 Less notice is required if the violation occurs closer to an election. 52 U.S.C. §20510(b)(2)-(3). \n6 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 86   Filed 07/28/17   Page 7 of 23\naggrieved[.]” 841 F. Supp. 2d 1320, 1335-36 (N.D. Ga. 2012) (citing ACORN v. Miller, 129 F.3d at \n838). The court noted “the State’s letter to [plaintiff’s] counsel, which included a voter registration \napplication [and] offer[ed] the assistance of the Secretary of State’s office,” and observed that “the \nletter and application appear to be more than an empty gesture.” Id. Instead, these were “Georgia’s \nattempt to comply with the NVRA with regard to [plaintiff]. The pre-litigation notice was meant to \nencourage exactly this sort of compliance attempt.” Id. \nThe Plaintiffs here lack standing because the record shows that Defendants have cured all \nalleged NVRA violations insofar as Stringer, Hernandez and Woods claim to have been aggrieved. \nPlaintiffs contend that the Court “rejected” this argument in ruling on Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss. \nSee Doc. 77, at 29. But that ruling made under Rule 12(b), construing Plaintiffs’ allegations as true \nwithout the benefit of a factual record. See, e.g., Doc. 82 at 12 (summary judgment standard). The \n(sizable) record developed in discovery makes is clear that, even if Plaintiffs were injured, such injury \nwas cured—and was cured well before the end of the notice period. Registration information for \nHernandez and Stringer was already current at the time they provided their purported notice, and \ninformation for Woods was updated within 15-days of the letter sent to Defendants’ counsel on his \nbehalf.8 Moreover, Defendants have repeatedly and in good faith offered to assist Plaintiffs in \nregistering to vote or verifying their voter registration status, conferred with Plaintiffs’ counsel about \npotential common-sense reforms, and even implemented some of Plaintiffs’ suggestions. E.g., Doc. \n88 at 14 and citations to summary judgment proof therein. \nThis is, indeed, “exactly: what the “pre-litigation notice was meant to encourage.” Scott, 771 \nU.S. at 836 (citation omitted). As explained in Defendants’ summary judgment motion, “the purpose \n                                                 \n8 Hernandez’s voter registration was updated on December 14, 2014. See Doc. 82-1, Ex. I. Stringer’s voter registration \nwas updated on May 23, 2015. Id. Woods’ was updated December 3, 2015. Id. Hernandez was individually identified in \na May 27, 2015 letter purporting to provide notice. See Doc. 1, Ex. C at pp. 2-17. Stringer and Woods were identified in \nlater putative notice letters sent on October 23, 2015, and November 18, 2015, respectively. Id. at pp. 171-72; 195-96. \n7 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 86   Filed 07/28/17   Page 8 of 23\nof the notice requirement was to ‘provide states...an opportunity to attempt compliance before facing \nlitigation.’” Id. at 835-36 (quoting ACORN v. Miller, 129 F.3d at 838) (alterations in Scott). Elsewise, \nimmunity is not waived. E.g., Cox v. City of Dallas, 256 F.3d at 309; ACORN v. Fowler, 178 F.3d at \n367 n.11. Here, by providing notice of registration “violations” that had already been corrected, \nPlaintiffs  are  attempting  a  thinly  veiled  end-run  around  Congress’s  notice  requirement—a \nprerequisite to invoking the NVRA’s limited waiver of immunity. Because the record establishes that \nany NVRA violation alleged by Hernandez, Stringer and Woods was cured within the notice period, \nthe Plaintiffs do not have standing to seek relief, and the Court lacks jurisdiction under the NVRA’s \nspecific remedial scheme. \nIt is also worth emphasizing, as the Fifth Circuit did in Scott, that NVRA standing must be \nsatisfied as to each plaintiff. Since Scott had not provided the required notice and opportunity to cure, \nhe had no basis to seek relief on his own behalf. 771 F.3d at 836. “[C]onsequently, he [wa]s not \nentitled to seek relief for others, either.” Id. Because a plaintiff who does not have statutory standing \nin his own right cannot assert a private right of action on behalf of others—and because Hernandez, \nStringer and Woods all lack standing—this case should be dismissed for want of jurisdiction. \nB.  Woods also lacks standing because he failed to provide notice of an NVRA violation. \nTo assert a cause of action under the NVRA, a plaintiff must prove that the alleged violation \noccurred in the context of a federal election. Broyles v. Texas, 618 F. Supp. 2d 661, 690 (S.D. Tex. \n2009); see also, e.g., 52 U.S.C. §20503(a). Woods has not even alleged—much less provided \nevidence—that any NVRA violation impacted his participation in a federal election. Rather, Woods \nonly provided putative notice of alleged violations in the context of a 2015 non-federal election. See \nDoc. 1, Ex. C at pp. 171-72; Doc. 80, Ex. C. This is an independent reason that he lacks standing,9 \n                                                 \n9 Woods’ claims also must fail on the merits, as a matter of law, given the undisputed fact that his rights were not impacted \nin the context of any federal election. Id.; 52 U.S.C. §20503. \n8 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 86   Filed 07/28/17   Page 9 of 23\nand his claims must be dismissed. E.g., Broyles, 618 F. Supp. 2d at 690. \nC.  Plaintiffs cannot establish Article III standing. \n \nThe purpose of the standing doctrine is to “give meaning to Article III’s case-or-controversy \nrequirement.” Sample v. Morrison, 406 F.3d 310, 312 (5th Cir. 2005). Standing is an essential component \nof subject-matter jurisdiction. Id. To establish Article III standing, a plaintiff must show: (1) an injury-\nin-fact; (2) that is traceable to the defendant’s challenged conduct (causation); and (3) that is likely \nto be redressed by a favorable decision in the district court (redressability). Friends of the Earth, Inc. \nv. Laidlaw Envtl. Servs., Inc., 528 U.S. 167, 180–81 (2000); see also Tex. Democratic Party v. \nBenkiser, 459 F.3d 582, 585–86 (5th Cir. 2006). These elements are “an indispensable part of the \nplaintiff’s case.” Lujan v. Defs. of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 561 (1992). The party seeking to invoke \nfederal jurisdiction bears the burden of establishing all three elements. Id. If a party lacks standing to \nbring a claim, the court lacks subject-matter jurisdiction over that claim. See Crane v. Johnson, 783 \nF.3d 244, 251 (5th Cir. 2015). Plaintiffs’ case should be dismissed on summary judgment because \nthey have established neither causation nor redressability. \n1.  Plaintiffs’ claims are not traceable to any conduct by Defendants, but are instead \nthe result of their own behavior. \n \nThe record demonstrates that there is no causal link between the Defendants and the Plaintiffs \nalleged injuries, as required to establish Article III standing. That is, even assuming an injury in fact, \nsuch injury must be fairly traceable to a defendant’s challenged action. Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560. The \nFifth Circuit has held that claimed constitutional injury stemming from a plaintiff’s own inaction \nsevers the causal link between the alleged injury and any conduct of the defendant. Westfall v. Miller, \n77 F.3d 868, 871-73 (5th Cir. 1996). So, too, here. \nIn Westfall, a prospective machine gun buyer challenged a federal requirement that machine \ngun transferees submit a form to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (“ATF”). Id. at 869-\n9 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 86   Filed 07/28/17   Page 10 of 23\n70. The form required a certification from a local law enforcement official, which Westfall requested \nfrom all such officials within a five-mile radius of his home, but all refused. See id. at 869-70. ATF \ninformed Westfall of other officials from whom he could seek the certification, but Westfall “made \nno effort to obtain certifications from [those] officials[.]” Id. at 872. The Court concluded that \nWestfall lacked standing to challenge the constitutionality of the certification requirement, since \nWestfall’s own inaction—making no effort to obtain the certification from other officials, despite \nbeing told specifically from whom he could request it—caused any injury he claimed to have suffered. \nId. at 871-72. The Court also noted that the certification process may have been “cumbersome, \nfrustrating, and inconvenient for the plaintiff,” but was nonetheless required by applicable law. Id. \nA similar analysis is appropriate here. Plaintiffs’ alleged injury occurred when each changed \ninformation on his driver license online, and believed that his voter registration information would be \nupdated. But the website each Plaintiff used required him to acknowledge “[s]electing ‘Yes’ does not \nregister you to vote” and indicated that his voter registration information would not be updated until \nhe submitted a written, signed request form. E.g., Doc. 1-2, Ex. A at 2. No Plaintiff claims to have \nsubmitted a request to update voter registration information in writing, and signed, as Texas law \nrequires. Hernandez Depo. 39:10-15; Stringer Depo. 49:1-9; Woods Depo. 74:12-75:7. See supra, \n“Response to Plaintiffs’ Statement of Facts” and citations therein. Thus, the cause of Plaintiffs’ \nalleged injuries—like the cause of the injuries alleged in Westfall—was Plaintiffs’ inaction. Their \ncomplaints about inability to vote at a location where they never took the necessary steps to register \nare not fairly traceable to any conduct of Defendants. \n2.  Plaintiffs’ claims are moot. \n \nIn their summary judgment motion, Defendants explain why Plaintiffs’ claims are moot. Doc. \n82 at 16-19. Nothing in Plaintiffs’ summary judgment motion changes this result. That is, Plaintiffs \noffer no evidence to refute Defendants’ summary judgment proof, which establishes that each \n10 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 86   Filed 07/28/17   Page 11 of 23\nPlaintiff is currently registered at his desired address, and will submit a written, signed request next \ntime he wishes to make a change to his voter registration information. See id. and summary judgment \nproof cited therein. Thus, each Plaintiff lacks the personal interest in this suit required to establish a \njusticiable case or controversy. E.g., Dep’t of Tex., Veterans of Foreign Wars v. Tex. Lottery Comm’n, \n760 F.3d 427, 432 (5th Cir. 2014) (For an injury to be redressable, a plaintiff must show that a \nfavorable decision would likely remedy it). Since no order from the Court would remedy any injury \nPlaintiffs claim to have suffered, the Court should enter summary judgment dismissing this case. \nD.  If Plaintiffs have standing, it extends only to claims related to online changes of address. \n \nPlaintiffs have only presented evidence that they sought to change their addresses online, not \nthat they sought to renew their driver licenses online. Doc. 77 at 10-12. Yet, they seek declaratory \nand injunctive relief in connection with online driver license renewals, in addition to online changes \nof address. Doc. 77 at 25 (request for relief). It is a bedrock principle of standing that alleged injury \nmust be particularized, and “[f]or an injury to be ‘particularized,’ it ‘must affect the plaintiff in a \npersonal and individual way.’” Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins, 136 S. Ct. 1540, 1548 (2016), as revised (May \n24, 2016) (collecting cases) (citations omitted). \nThe NVRA context is no different. Indeed, the statutory authorization for private rights of \naction under 52 U.S.C. §20510(b)(1) limits relief to “[a] person who is aggrieved by a violation of \nthis chapter[.]” And such persons—assuming they provide notice and the violation is not corrected—\n“may bring a civil action in an appropriate district court for declaratory or injunctive relief,” but only \n“with respect to the violation” by which that individual claims to have been aggrieved. 52 U.S.C. \n§20510(b)(2), (1). See also, e.g., Scott, 771 F.3d at 835 n.8 (“Scott’s counsel conceded at oral \nargument that Scott lacks Article III standing on the remote transactions issue. Because all his \ntransactions were in person, he suffered no injury relating to remote transactions.”); cf. id. at 837 \n(Though NAACP had organizational standing, it only had such standing as to those transactions on \n11 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 86   Filed 07/28/17   Page 12 of 23\nwhich it had “expended [resources] to counteract Schedler’s allegedly illegal conduct.”). The only \ntransactions by the Plaintiffs that the record reflects are online changes of address. Doc. 77-1. Thus, \nif Plaintiffs have standing at all, it is limited to those transactions, because it is only those transactions \nby which Plaintiffs claim to have been aggrieved. E.g., id. at 835, 837; 52 U.S.C. §20510(b)(1)-(2). \nII.  The record shows that Defendants process online DPS transactions in a manner that \ncomplies with the NVRA. \n \nIn their summary judgment motion, Plaintiffs allege that Defendants have violated the NVRA \nin five ways, each of which Defendants address in turn. Doc. 77 at 14-19. \nFirst, Plaintiffs allege that “Defendants fail to treat online driver’s license renewal applications \nas  ‘simultaneous’  voter  registration  applications  in  violation  of  52  U.S.C.  §§20503(a)(1), \n20504(a)(1), and 20504(a)(2).” Doc. 77 at 15. To begin, the word “simultaneous” appears in the \nspecific context of driver license applications. In that context, the NVRA requires states to “establish \nprocedures to register to vote in elections for Federal office by application made simultaneously with \nan application for a motor vehicle driver’s license pursuant to [§]20504 of this title.” Id. §20503(a)(1) \n(emphasis supplied). That is, states are tasked with establishing procedures that give individuals an \nopportunity to “make application” to register to vote at the same time they apply for a driver license.10 \n The NVRA continues, “[e]ach State motor vehicle driver’s license application (including any \nrenewal application) submitted to the appropriate State motor vehicle authority under State law shall \nserve as an application for voter registration with respect to elections for Federal office unless the \napplicant fails to sign the voter registration application.” Id. §20504(a)(1) (emphasis supplied). And \nunder §20504(a)(2), “[a]n application for voter registration submitted under paragraph (1) shall be \nconsidered as updating any previous voter registration by the applicant.” \n                                                 \n10 This portion of the NVRA does not say anything about renewals—and certainly says nothing of changes of address—\nbut speaks generally of applications. Notably, Defendants do not permit first-time applicants for driver licenses to submit \nsuch applications online, and first-time driver license applications are not at issue here. See generally, Docs. 1, 77. \n12 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 86   Filed 07/28/17   Page 13 of 23\nPlaintiffs do not dispute that they did not sign the voter registration application when they \nchanged their addresses online. Hernandez Depo. 39:10-15; Stringer Depo. 49:1-9; Woods Depo. \n74:12-75:7. And, in any event, Defendants do not run afoul of the NVRA by failing to register \nindividuals who fail to sign the voter registration application. Rather, they are not empowered to \nregister individuals to vote who do not sign the voter registration application, under either the NVRA \nor Texas law.11 TEX. ELEC. CODE §§13.002(a), (b); 15.021(a); cf. id. §15.021(d). See also id. \n§§20.063(a)-(c); 20.066(a)-(c); 52 U.S.C. §20504(c)(2)(C). Moreover—though they exaggerate its \nonerousness—Plaintiffs do not dispute that, in transacting with DPS online, customers have an \nopportunity to complete a voter registration application. See Doc. 77 at 7-10. Texas has—as required \nby the NVRA—established a “procedure to register to vote…by application made simultaneous with \nan application” for a driver license. See supra “Response to Plaintiffs’ Statement of Facts”; 52 U.S.C. \n§20503(a)(1).12 \nPlaintiffs present no evidence that they applied for or renewed a driver license, no evidence \nthat they signed a voter registration form and were not registered to vote, and no evidence that they \nwere not provided with a voter registration form when they changed the address on their Texas driver \nlicenses online. See Doc. 77-1. They also present no evidence that Defendants fail to offer applicants \nfor driver licenses an opportunity—during an online transaction with DPS—to complete a voter \nregistration application. Plaintiffs claim only that they failed to sign the voter registration application. \nTheir claims under 52 U.S.C. §§20503(a)(1), 20504(a)(1), and 20504(a)(2) fail as a matter of law. \n                                                 \n11 Plaintiffs attempt to analogize online transactions to in person and mail transactions falls flat, because—in those \ncircumstances—the customer provides a signed request to register or update registration information when they are \nrequesting that registration or change, as Texas law requires. E.g., Ingram Depo. 53:1-14. \n12 To the extent Plaintiffs assert that requiring procedures for simultaneous application requires simultaneous registration, \nthis is wrong. See, e.g., 52 U.S.C. §20504(e)(1) (applicant information “shall be transmitted to the appropriate State \nelection official not later than 10 days after the date of acceptance”); Ferrand v. Schedler, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 61862 \n(E.D. La. May 3, 2012) (in enacting predecessor to 52 U.S.C. §20506, NVRA provision applicable to other state voter \nregistration agencies, “it is evident to this Court that Congress was concerned with making sure that every person was \ngiven the opportunity to register to vote.”) (emphasis supplied). \n13 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 86   Filed 07/28/17   Page 14 of 23\nSecond, Plaintiffs allege that “Defendants fail to treat online driver’s license change-of-\naddress applications as notifications for voter registration in violation of 52 U.S.C. §20504(d).” Doc. \n77 at 17. Under that statute: \n[a]ny change of address form submitted in accordance with State law for purposes of a \nState motor vehicle driver’s license shall serve as notification of change of address for \nvoter registration with respect to elections for Federal office for the registrant involved \nunless the registrant states on the form that the change of address is not for voter \nregistration purposes. \n \n52 U.S.C. §20504(d) (emphasis supplied). Texas law provides that “[a] change of address that relates \nto a license or card and that is submitted in person or by mail serves as a change of address for voter \nregistration unless the licensee or cardholder indicates that the change is not for voter registration \npurposes.” TEX. ELEC. CODE §20.063(c) (emphasis supplied). Texas law further requires a signature, \naffirming  under  penalty  of  perjury  that  the  individual  making  a  change  to  voter  registration \ninformation is eligible to vote. Id. §63.002. So, too, does the NVRA. 52 U.S.C. §20504(c)(2)(C)(iii). \nThe record reflects two independent reasons why Plaintiffs’ claims under §20504(d) fail as a \nmatter of law. First, Plaintiffs did not submit a change of address in person or by mail;13 did not \nsubmit a written, signed request to update voter registration information;14 and did not submit a \nchange to voter registration information under any statutory exception to the written, signed request \nrequirement. 15 Cf. TEX. ELEC. CODE §§13.002(a), (b); 15.021(a), (d); 20.063(a)-(c); 20.066(a)-(c); 52 \nU.S.C. §20504(c)(2)(C). Thus, the transactions upon which Plaintiffs seek to recover are not properly \nregarded as “notification[s] of change of address for voter registration,” because they were not \nsubmitted “in accordance with State law.” 52 U.S.C. §20504(d). \nMoreover, even if such changes of address could properly be regarded as being submitted “in \n                                                 \n13 Doc. 82-1 at Exs. A, Hernandez Resp. to Rog. 2; B, Stringer Resp. to Rog. 2; C, Woods Resp. to Rog. 2. \n14 Hernandez Depo. 39:10-15; Stringer Depo. 49:1-9; Woods Depo. 74:12-75:7. \n15 E.g., Doc.1 (All of Plaintiffs’ allegations arising out of inter-county, rather than intra-county, moves). \n14 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 86   Filed 07/28/17   Page 15 of 23\naccordance with State law”—or, if State law were of no import—16the record shows that Plaintiffs \ndid, indeed, “state on the form that the change of address” they made online was “not for voter \nregistration  purposes.”  In  particular,  the  change-of-address  website  Plaintiffs  used  states  that \n“[s]electing ‘Yes’ does not register you to vote.” Doc. 1-2, Ex. A at 2. Scott v. Schedler, the most \nanalogous controlling authority in this context, demonstrates that the inclusion of this language on \nthe online interface functions, for purposes of the NVRA, as a “state[ment] on the form that the \nchange of address is not for voter registration purposes.” 771 F.3d at 840; 52 U.S.C. §20504(d). \nScott challenged Louisiana’s implementation of an NVRA requirement that public assistance \nagencies “provide each applicant with voter registration forms ‘unless the applicant, in writing, \ndeclines to register to vote.’” 771 F.3d at 840 (citation omitted). The NVRA required these “voter \nregistration agencies to provide all applicants with declination forms, which read: ‘If you are not \nregistered to vote…would you like to apply to register to vote here today?’” Id. Louisiana’s form \ncontained “two boxes to check: yes or no,” and stated “‘IF YOU DO NOT CHECK EITHER BOX, \nYOU WILL BE CONSIDERED TO HAVE DECIDED NOT TO REGISTER TO VOTE AT THIS \nTIME.’” Id. Individuals who checked neither box did not receive a voter registration application. The \nScott plaintiffs alleged that this violated the NVRA’s requirement to provide a form “‘unless the \napplicant, in writing, declines to register to vote.’” Id. (citation omitted). \nBut the Fifth Circuit disagreed, holding “that an applicant handing back a form with neither \nbox checked has created documentation ‘in writing’ showing that he did not wish to register.” Id. at \n840 (citation omitted). The Court \nrel[ied] on the plain meaning of ‘IF YOU DO NOT CHECK EITHER BOX, YOU \nWILL BE CONSIDERED TO HAVE DECIDED NOT TO REGISTER TO VOTE AT \nTHIS TIME.’ The capital letters mandated by the NVRA drive home the importance \nof the message: not checking either box equals a decision not to register to vote. \n \n                                                 \n16 See infra pp.18-19. \n15 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 86   Filed 07/28/17   Page 16 of 23\nId. (citation omitted). It concluded, “[r]equiring that a declination be ‘in writing,’ rather than oral, \ncreates evidence showing that the state complied with the NVRA despite not distributing a voter \nregistration form.” Id. (citation omitted). \nAlthough Scott arose under NVRA provisions applicable to public benefits offices—rather \nthan 52 U.S.C. §20504(d) —the Fifth Circuit’s analysis informs Plaintiffs’ allegations. Just as “an \napplicant handing back a form with neither box checked has created documentation ‘in writing’ \nshowing that he did not wish to register,” a customer checking “yes” or “no” under a prompt that \nstates “[s]electing ‘yes’ does not register you to vote[,]” states that the change of address is not for \nvoter registration purposes. Scott, 771 F.3d at 840 (citation omitted); 52 U.S.C. §20504(d). This is \nemphasized by the fact that, as online Texas DPS customers, Plaintiffs were presented with the bolded \ntext: “[s]electing ‘yes’ does not register you to vote[,]” just as Louisiana public assistance applicants \nwho are told “YOU WILL BE CONSIDERED TO HAVE DECIDED NOT TO REGISTER TO \nVOTE AT THIS TIME,” in all caps. P’s Ex. A at 2; Scott, 771 F.3d at 840. Under Scott, Plaintiffs \nstated that their changes of address were not for voter registration purposes. \nPlaintiffs failed to submit their desired changes to voter registration information in accordance \nwith state law. Plaintiffs also stated that their changes of address were not for voter registration \npurposes. Each of these undisputed facts provides an independent reason why Plaintiffs’ claims under \n52 U.S.C. §20504(d) fail as a matter of law. \nThird, Plaintiffs contend that requiring submission of a written, signed request for voter \nregistration  “upon  completion  of  online  transactions  violates  the  NVRA’s  prohibition  against \nrequiring duplicative information, 52 U.S.C. §20504(c)(2).” Doc. 77 at 17. But the NVRA makes \nplain that duplicative information is permissible, so long as that information is limited to the \n“minimum amount of information necessary to prevent duplicate voter registrations and enable State \nelection officials to assess the eligibility of the applicant and to administer voter registration and other \n16 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 86   Filed 07/28/17   Page 17 of 23\nparts of the election process.” 52 U.S.C. §20504(c)(2)(B). And the summary judgment record reflects \nthat the written, signed request for voter registration, and changes to voter registration information, \nis necessary “to prevent duplicate voter registrations and enable State election officials to assess the \neligibility of the applicant and to administer voter registration and other parts of the election process” \nwhen Texans move from one county to another. Id.; see also supra, “Response to Plaintiffs’ Statement \nof Facts” and citations therein; see generally  \nWhat’s  more,  the  NVRA  requires  that  voter  registration  applications  “shall  include  a \nstatement  that  requires  the  signature  of  the  applicant,  under  penalty  of  perjury.”  52  U.S.C. \n§20504(c)(2)(C).  Such  applications  specifically  may  require  a  “second  signature.”  Id. \n§20504(c)(2)(A). The NVRA leaves these determinations to the states, consistent with their time, \nplace, and manner prerogative and discretion to implement the NVRA in the context of their voter \nregistration framework. See, e.g., Arizona v. Inter Tribal Council of Arizona, Inc., 133 S. Ct. 2247, \n2253 (2013). Plaintiffs, in fact, acknowledge that the NVRA was intended to afford states discretion \n“‘as to how to administer th[e] process and how to integrate it with [each State’s] drivers license \nprocess.’” Doc. 9 at 2 n.1 (quoting S. Rep. No. 103-6, at 5-6 (1993) (alteration original)). Thus, \nPlaintiffs’ claims under 52 U.S.C. §20504(c)(2) fail as a matter of law. \nFourth, Plaintiffs contend that Defendants “fail[] to transmit voter registration information \nsubmitted during online driver’s license transactions,” in violation of 52 U.S.C. §20504(e). Doc. 77 \nat 18. Under that statute: \n(1) Subject to paragraph (2), a completed voter registration portion of an application \nfor a State motor vehicle driver’s license accepted at a State motor vehicle authority \nshall be transmitted to the appropriate State election official not later than 10 days after \nthe date of acceptance. \n \n(2) If a registration application is accepted within 5 days before the last day for \nregistration to vote in an election, the application shall be transmitted to the appropriate \nState election official not later than 5 days after the date of acceptance. \n \n17 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 86   Filed 07/28/17   Page 18 of 23\n52 U.S.C. §20504(e). But here again, pursuant to Texas law, a voter registration application is not \n“complete” unless it is submitted in writing, and signed by the applicant (or subject to the intra-county \nexception inapplicable here). E.g., TEX. ELEC. CODE §13.002; also supra, “Response to Plaintiffs’ \nStatement of Facts” and citations therein. And, in any event, Plaintiffs have presented no summary \njudgment evidence to support a claim valid Texas voter registration applications submitted to DPS \nare not transmitted to SOS, and then on to the counties, as required by Texas and federal law. This \nclaim fails as a matter of law. \nFifth, Plaintiffs assert that SOS “fail[s] to ensure that eligible applicants are registered to vote \nupon completion of the voter registration portion of online driver’s license change-of-address and \nrenewal,” and that this “violates 52 U.S.C. §20507(a)(1)(A).” Doc. 77 at 18. That provision states: \nIn the administration of voter registration for elections for Federal office, each State \nshall ensure that any eligible applicant is registered to vote in an election in the case of \nregistration with a motor vehicle application under section 20504 of this title, if the \nvalid voter registration form of the applicant is submitted to the appropriate State motor \nvehicle authority not later than the lesser of 30 days, or the period provided by State \nlaw, before the date of the election[.] \n \n52 U.S.C. §20507(a)(1)(A) (emphasis supplied). Thus, this statute presupposes submission of a valid \nvoter registration form. In Texas, voter registration forms are valid when they are “in writing and \nsigned by the applicant,” unless an exception applies. TEX. ELEC. CODE §13.002; see also supra, \n“Response to Plaintiffs’ Statement of Facts” and citations therein. Moreover, Plaintiffs have provided \nno evidence of SOS’s alleged “fail[ure] to ensure that eligible applicants are registered to vote” upon \nsubmission of a valid voter registration form to DPS. \n  Finally, in response to all of Plaintiffs’ allegations of NVRA violations, it is worth noting that \nthe provisions of Texas law requiring the procedures about which Plaintiffs complain are not \npreempted by the NVRA, because they do not directly conflict with it. Under the Election Clause, \nCongress may enact laws that preempt state election laws concerning federal elections. Foster v. Love, \n18 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 86   Filed 07/28/17   Page 19 of 23\n522 U.S. 67, 69 (1977). “When it does, the federal legislation renders any conflicting state laws \ninoperative. To this end, state election laws cannot directly conflict with federal election laws on the \nsubject.” Voting for Am., Inc. v. Steen, 732 F.3d 382, 399 (5th Cir. 2013) (citations and quotation \nmarks omitted). As the Court recognized in Steen, a state law may conflict with the NVRA where it \n“impos[es] additional conditions…on its acceptance of voter registrations.” 732 F.3d at 400 (citing \nArizona v. Inter Tribal Council of Arizona, 133 S. Ct. 2247). As set forth above, all of the NVRA \nprovisions under which Plaintiffs seek relief can be read consistent with the NVRA. With respect to \nthe signature issue in particular, the NVRA itself requires a signature, and does not directly conflict \nwith Texas law that governs how and when that signature is provided.17 \nIII.  Plaintiffs’ Equal Protection claim fails as a matter of law. \n \n “The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment commands that no State shall \n‘deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws,’ which is essentially a \ndirection that all persons similarly situated should be treated alike.” City of Cleburne. v. Cleburne \nLiving Ctr., 473 U.S. 432, 439 (1985) (citation omitted). Unless a plaintiff identifies a comparator \nwho is similarly situated in all relevant respects, but was treated differently, he cannot recover under \nthe Equal Protection Clause. Nordlinger v. Hahn, 505 U.S. 1, 10 (1992). \nPlaintiffs have not even attempted to offer evidence of any individual who was similarly \nsituated to them in all relevant respects, but treated differently under the law. That is, Plaintiffs have \nnot identified other individuals who (1) failed to make a written, signed request to update their voter \nregistration, and (2) had their voter registration information updated after moving from one county to \n                                                 \n17 Moreover, to the extent the NVRA itself is inconsistent, “[the Court] must interpret [the NVRA] in a way that avoids \nintroducing an inconsistency into the statute.” Scott, 771 F.3d at 840 (citation omitted). \n19 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 86   Filed 07/28/17   Page 20 of 23\nanother. At this summary judgment stage, this is fatal to their Equal Protection claim. Nordlinger v. \nHahn, 505 U.S. at 10.18 \nAnd as a factual matter, there is nothing “disparate” about requiring all individuals to provide \na signature at the time they request changes to their voter registration information between counties. \nAnd despite Plaintiffs’ breathless protestations that “Defendants have not explained, and cannot \nexplain, how the handwritten signature requirement is necessary,” Doc. 77 at 22, Texas law requires \nindividuals who wish to change their voter registration information from one county to another to \nmake that request in writing, and sign it. It is not Defendants’ burden, in defeating an Equal Protection \nclaim, to “explain how the [challenged] requirement is necessary.” Id. Rather, Plaintiffs must identify \na similarly situated comparator who was treated differently under the law. They cannot do so here. \nMoreover, although the Equal Protection Clause imposes no “necessity” requirement on \nchallenged legislation, as Plaintiffs suggest, Defendants refer Plaintiffs to the response to Plaintiffs’ \nStatement of Facts. This sets forth why Texas law operates the way it does, and how those laws bind \nDefendants’ actions. In short, the legislature requires all changes of address between counties to be \nsubmitted in writing, and signed by the applicant.19 And this requirement applies to all individuals, \nconsistent with Texas law, regardless of the artificial distinction Plaintiffs attempt to create here. \nTheir Equal Protection claim fails as a matter of law.20 \nIV.  If the Court finds that the Plaintiffs have carried their burden of proof, its remedy \nshould be limited. \n \nIf the Court decides that the Plaintiffs have carried their burden of proof, in whole or in part, \nthere are two important limits on the Court’s remedial authority. \n                                                 \n18 Defendants reiterate the argument, urged supra, that the NVRA’s own remedial scheme provides the exclusive list of \nremedies for alleged violations thereof. \n19 Moreover, it is wholly consistent with the NVRA for States to require signatures contemporaneous with requests to \nupdate voter registration information. \n20 Plaintiffs attempt to characterize Texas voter registration law as a “burden” on the right to vote, but cite no authority \nfor this proposition, and fail to explain how it is relevant to their Equal Protection claim. \n20 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 86   Filed 07/28/17   Page 21 of 23\nFirst, any injunctive relief extended to the named parties “must be narrowly tailor[ed]…to \nremedy the specific action which gives rise to the order.” John Doe 1 v. Veneman, 280 F.3d 807, 818 \n(5th Cir. 2004). As the pleadings indicate, the sole matter in issue is whether Defendants’ handling \nof online driver license transactions violates 52 U.S.C. §§20503, 20504, and/or 20507. See Doc. 77. \nAccordingly, to be proper under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65, any injunction must be narrowly \ntailored to address conduct related to those laws. Veneman, 280 F.3d at 818 (injunction that is vague \nor overbroad violates Rule 65). Plaintiffs’ proposed “catch-all” injunction would violate Rule 65 on \nits face as it is untethered to any conduct at issue. Doc. 77 at 30 (seeking to enjoin “Defendants, their \nagents and successors in office, and all customers working in concert with them, from implementing \npractices and procedures that likewise violate the NVRA.”). It would also be impermissibly vague, \nas it would not adequately inform an ordinary person exactly what conduct is proscribed. U.S. Steel \nCorp. v. United Mine Workers of Am., 519, F.2d 1236, 1246 n. 20 (5th Cir. 1975). \nSecond, Plaintiffs’ request for monitoring is not an appropriate remedy and is unwarranted \nhere. Rather, such relief is the “most intrusive of remedies,” which should be considered within Rule \n65’s requirement that a remedy must be narrowly tailored to “achieve the federal law’s ends in the \nleast obtrusive possible manner.” United States v. Louisiana, 196 F. Supp. 3d 612, 677 (M.D. La. \nJuly 26, 2016) (granting United States’ motion for summary judgment on whether Louisiana violated \nthe NVRA but denying the federal government’s request to order monitoring and reporting to ensure \ncompliance). This is particularly true in the context of functions—such as the conduct of elections—\nthat the Constitution assigns to state and local governments. Indeed, remedies like monitoring “are to \nbe reserved for extreme cases of demonstrated noncompliance with milder measure.” ACORN v. \nEdgar, 56 F.3d 791, 798 (7th Cir. 1995). “They are last resorts, not first.” Id.  \nShould the Court find for the Plaintiffs, an injunction delineating with particularity the steps \nrequired of the Defendants is the proper remedy. Id. “But until it appears that the state will not comply \n21 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 86   Filed 07/28/17   Page 22 of 23\nwith such an injunction, there is no occasion for the entry of a complicated decree that treats the state \nas an outlaw and requires it to do even more than the ‘motor voter’ law requires.” Id. \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, Defendants respectfully move the Court to deny Plaintiffs’ \nMotion for Summary Judgment and, for the reasons stated in Defendants’ Motion for Summary \nJudgment, render judgment for Defendants on all claims and dismiss this case entirely.  \nRespectfully submitted, \n             \n              KEN PAXTON \nAttorney General of Texas \n \nJEFFREY C.

Defendants \nerroneously claim that such a ruling is required by the Federal Rule on intervention. It is not. The \nFifth Circuit Court of Appeals has previously permitted intervention in circumstances similar to \nthose present here, and Intervenors meet all of the necessary prerequisites for both intervention as \nof right and permissive intervention under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24. The procedural \nposture of this case does nothing to alter those realities. Accordingly, Intervenors respectfully \nrequest that this Court grant their motion to intervene.  \nI. ARGUMENT \nA. Intervenors have independent grounds of jurisdiction to support this lawsuit. \nIntervenors’ have independent Article III standing to continue this lawsuit when plaintiffs \nare dismissed. Article III standing is not necessarily a prerequisite to intervention, see Diamond v. \nCharles, 476 U.S. 54, 68 (1986), and an intervenor who does not possess standing cannot intervene \nin a jurisdictionally defective case because they cannot provide the court with jurisdiction. But \nintervenors who have Article III standing are different, as they ensure that the court has jurisdiction \nand can allow an otherwise foreclosed action to continue. This principle explains why intervenors \nwho have Article III standing are commonly permitted to continue litigating an action when the \nparty on whose side they intervened does not wish to continue: “an intervenor’s right to continue \na suit in the absence of the party on whose side intervention was permitted is contingent upon a \nshowing by the intervenor that he fulfills the requirements of Art. III.” Id. Similarly, Intervenors’ \nindependent bases for jurisdiction permit this action to proceed, allowing the court to treat their \n1 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 134   Filed 01/17/20   Page 5 of 10\n \npleadings as a separate action to promote efficiency and avoiding unnecessary delay. See 7C \nCharles Alan Wright & Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure § 1917 (3d ed.).  \nIn Hunt Tool Co. v. Moore, Inc., 212 F.2d 685 (5th Cir. 1954), the Fifth Circuit permitted \nprecisely what the Intervenors seek here: intervention to allow an intervenor to “cure[] the \njurisdictional defects of the original action” when such defects would otherwise require dismissal. \nId. at 688. In Hunt, the jurisdictional defect was a lack of diversity of citizenship, cured by \ndismissing the non-diverse parties. Id. Here, Intervenors seek “to cure[] the jurisdictional defect” \nof lack of a party with Article III standing. That the intervenors in Hunt sought intervention at a \ndifferent time in the case than Intervenors here do is of no moment. See Defs.’ Br. 4-6. The Fifth \nCircuit has detailed what it requires for a motion for intervention to be “timely” under the Federal \nRules, and Intervenors meet that standard. See supra at 3-4. Defendants’ repeated references to the \ncurrent posture of the case are merely an attempt to impose a different timeliness standard on \nIntervenors out of thin air. The court should reject this effort. \nB. Allowing intervention would not defy the Fifth Circuit’s mandate.  \nDefendants attempt to overstate the Fifth Circuit’s mandate, but its plain language permits \nIntervenors’ action here.  As Defendants acknowledge, the Fifth Circuit remanded this case with \nonly the following mandate: “dismiss Plaintiffs’ claims for lack of standing.” Stringer v. Whitley, \n942 F.3d 715, 725 (5th Cir. 2019). While that mandate requires dismissal of the current plaintiffs’ \nclaims, it says nothing about Intervenors’ claims. This Court’s decision to allow the intervention \nof the Intervenors would not contravene the Fifth Circuit’s mandate, and the mere fact that the \nFifth Circuit mandated dismissal of the current Plaintiffs’ claims does not—standing alone—\nrequire that this case conclude. See N.Y. State Nat. Org. for Women v. Pataki, 228 F. Supp. 2d 420, \n428  (S.D.N.Y.  2002)  (indicating  that  an  appellate  court’s  mandate  for  dismissal  does  not \n2 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 134   Filed 01/17/20   Page 6 of 10\n \nnecessarily signal the end of the case on remand). Contrary to Defendants’ assertions, Intervenors \nseek to have the court adjudicate the merits of their claims, not those of the current plaintiffs, and \nthe cases cited by Defendants do not capture this distinction.1  \nC.  Intervenors meet the requirements to intervene as of right.   \n Intervenors have satisfied Rule 24(a)(2)’s requirements for intervention as of right, and \nDefendants’ arguments to the contrary are meritless. First, Defendants mischaracterize the law and \nthe facts of this case to argue that Intervenors’ motion is untimely. Defs.’ Br. 10. For purposes of \ntimeliness, what matters is when intervenors know their interests are no longer adequately \nrepresented. United Airlines, Inc. v. McDonald, 432 U.S. 385, 394 (1977); see also Edwards v. \nCity of Houston, 78 F.3d 983, 1000 (5th Cir. 1996) (“The timeliness clock runs . . . from the time \nhe became aware that his interest would no longer be protected by the existing parties. . . .”). \nIntervenors’ interests were adequately protected throughout the litigation in this Court, and \nultimately the Court found in favor of those interests. The Fifth Circuit’s ruling that the current \nplaintiffs lacked standing was the first time that Intervenors’ interests were no longer adequately \nprotected. Accordingly, Intervenors moved to intervene shortly after that decision. Defendants \nmiss the mark by arguing that intervenors must intervene the moment they have an interest in a \ncase. That cannot be true under the Federal Rules, as intervention as of right is unavailable when \n“existing parties adequately represent [an intervenors’] interest.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(a)(2). Until \nthe Fifth Circuit found Plaintiffs’ standing lacking, Intervenors lacked a right to intervene. A ruling \n                                                            \n1 The Supreme Court has held that a district court may not revisit “questions which the mandate \nlaid to rest,” Sprague v. Ticonic Nat. Bank, 307 U.S. 161, 780 (1939), but this does not speak to \nissues not encompassed in the mandate. Id. at 781 (“While a mandate is controlling as to matters \nwithin its compass, on the remand a lower court is free as to other issues.”). Intervenors ask the \ndistrict court to consider the merits of their claims because their claims were not “laid to rest” by \nthe Fifth Circuit. The Fifth Circuit’s mandate is based on its standing analysis and, because \nIntervenors have Article III standing, the district court can adjudicate the merits of the claims.  \n3 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 134   Filed 01/17/20   Page 7 of 10\n \notherwise would force parties such as Intervenors into a no-win situation: move to intervene early, \nand get denied intervention because you lack the right to intervene, or intervene once your right \nmaterializes, but be told you waited too long. Neither the Rules nor precedent require this result. \nDefendants also argue they will be prejudiced by the intervention itself, but that is not the \ncorrect analysis under the Federal Rules. The Court only considers the potential prejudice to the \nparties caused by the delay in intervening, not the prejudice that may result from the intervention \nitself. Edwards, 78 F.3d at 1002; see also Stallworth v. Monsanto Co., 558 F.2d 257, 265 (5th Cir. \n1977).  As  noted  above,  Intervenors  moved  to  intervene  at  the  earliest  permissible  point; \naccordingly, Defendants have not been prejudiced by Intervenors’ timing. \nDefendants also erroneously contend that Intervenors fail to show impairment because they \n“concede” that they can bring a new action against Defendants. Defs.’ Br. 9. Defendants cite the \nfact that the Intervenors in this case are plaintiffs in a related case bringing different claims—Texas \nDemocratic Party, et al. v. Hughs, No. 5:20-cv-00008 (W.D. Tex. Jan. 6, 2020)—as evidence of \nIntervenors’ lack of impairment. Defendants’ points are unconvincing. First, the other case \nreferenced by Defendants does not impact Intervenors’ ability to pursue the claims about which \nthey seek to intervene. Even if Intervenors are granted intervention here, they will still pursue both \nlitigations, which raise different claims about related but different subject matters. Intervenors’ \ninvolvement in a separate lawsuit has nothing to do with their ability to intervene in this one. To \nclaim that any case filed by the same party divests that party of the right to intervene in a wholly \nseparate action is unsupported by the law. Second, the Fifth Circuit has permitted intervention \ndespite an intervenor’s ability to pursue additional litigation. Gaines v. Dixie Carriers, Inc., 434 \nF.2d 52, 54 (5th Cir. 1970). Third, Intervenors will be impaired if they are not allowed to intervene \nhere. As stated in Intervenors’ motion, if Intervenors are forced to bring a new suit, they will be \n4 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 134   Filed 01/17/20   Page 8 of 10\n \nprejudiced because any potential remedy will encounter further, unnecessary delays. See Int. Mot. \nat 7. By allowing this lawsuit to continue with Intervenors, “the [C]ourt can avoid the senseless \ndelay and expense of a new suit, which at long last will merely bring the parties to the point where \nthey now are.” Fuller v. Volk, 351 F.2d 323, 329 (3d Cir. 1965) (quotations and citations omitted). \n Intervenors’ motion is also supported by the unusual circumstances in this case. See Fed. \nR. Civ. P. 24(a)(2). Intervenors raise the exact same Equal Protection claims that the current \nplaintiffs have already successfully litigated. The Court has already reviewed the record in this \ncase and adjudicated the merits. Yet, Defendants continue to violate the law. Intervenors seek \nnothing more than to reinstitute the Court’s merits ruling, a ruling that directly impacts Intervenors \nand would alleviate Defendants’ denial of voting rights protections to millions of Texas voters.  \nD. In the alternative, the Court should grant Intervenors’ request for permissive \nintervention.  \nDefendants’ argument against permissive intervention fails for the same reasons as their \narguments against intervention as of right. To permissively intervene, Intervenors’ claims and \ndefenses must have questions of law and fact in common and intervention cannot unduly delay or \nprejudice the original parties. Stallworth, 558 F.2d at 269; Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(b)(1)(B), (3). As \ndiscussed above, Intervenors’ motion is timely. Moreover, Intervenors’ equal protection claim, \nlike Plaintiffs’, turns on Texas’ disparate treatment of eligible voters who utilize DPS’s online \nportal for driver’s license transactions. Intervenors therefore meet the requirements of Rule 24(b), \nand the Court should exercise its broad discretion in allowing intervention. Kneeland v. Nat’l \nCollegiate Athletic Ass’n, 806 F.2d 1285, 1289 (5th Cir. 1987).  \nII. CONCLUSION \nIntervenors respectfully request that this Court grant their Motion to intervene as a matter \nof right under Rule 24(a)(2) and for permissive intervention under Rule 24(b). \n5 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 134   Filed 01/17/20   Page 9 of 10\n \nDated: January 17, 2020.

McCraw, in his official capacity as Director of the Texas Department of Public Safety, \n(“Defendants”) move to dismiss this case pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) \nand 12(b)(6), for lack of jurisdiction, and failure to state a claim on which relief may be granted. \nINTRODUCTION \n  This case concerns the application of the National Voter Registration Act (“NVRA”) to \nTexas’s online service offerings for licensed drivers in the State. It presents a narrow question: \nwhen a State offers online driver license renewals and changes of address, does the NVRA also \nrequire  that  State  to  offer  online  voter  registration?  Because  the  NVRA  contains  no  such \nrequirement, this case should be dismissed for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be \ngranted. In fact, the Court need not even address the merits of this case, because none of the \nPlaintiffs has standing to bring it—either under traditional standing principles, or under the \nNVRA’s notice requirement. This case should therefore be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. \n1 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 7   Filed 05/16/16   Page 2 of 21\nLEGAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND \nI.  Voter Registration in Texas \nThe  Defendants—the  Texas  Secretary  of  State  (“SOS”)  and  Director  of  the  Texas \nDepartment of Public Safety (“DPS”)—each play a part in implementing the NVRA in Texas. \nTEX. ELEC. CODE §31.001(a) (SOS is chief election officer); id. §§20.061 et seq. (DPS is a voter \nregistration agency).1 Voter registration in Texas is, and has historically been, a county-based \nsystem. TEX. ELEC. CODE Chapter 12; Id. §12.001 (“The county tax assessor-collector is the voter \nregistrar for the county unless the position of county elections administrator is created or the county \nclerk is designated as the voter registrar.”). DPS and SOS work within this county-based system \nto implement the NVRA’s requirement that each State “establish procedures to register to vote in \nelections for Federal office by application made simultaneously with an application for a motor \nvehicle driver’s license pursuant to [§]20504 of this title.” 52 U.S.C. §20503(a)(1). \nThere are two types of motor vehicle driver license transactions at issue in this case: \nchanges of address and renewals. Compl. ¶5. With respect to renewals, the NVRA provides that \n[e]ach State motor vehicle driver’s license application (including any renewal \napplication) submitted to the appropriate State motor vehicle authority under State \nlaw shall serve as an application for voter registration with respect to elections for \nFederal office unless the applicant fails to sign the voter registration application.  \n \n52 U.S.C. §20504(a)(1) (emphasis supplied). \nWith respect to changes of address, the NVRA further provides that \nany change of address form submitted in accordance with State law for purposes of \na State motor vehicle driver’s license shall serve as notification of change of address \nfor voter registration with respect to elections for Federal office for the registrant \ninvolved unless the registrant states on the form that the change of address is not \nfor voter registration purposes. \n \n                                                 \n1 SOS also works with other designated voter registration agencies. See TEX. ELEC. CODE Ch. 20. \nThose agencies are not addressed here because they are not named in this case. \n2 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 7   Filed 05/16/16   Page 3 of 21\nId. §20504(d) (emphasis supplied). \n \nThe NVRA also specifies certain “forms and procedures” for voter registration applications \nunder the Act. Such applications may require the “minimum amount of information necessary \nto prevent duplicate voter registrations and enable State election officials to assess the eligibility \nof the applicant and to administer voter registration and other parts of the election process.” Id. \n§20504(c)(2)(B). Applications further “require[] the signature of the applicant, under penalty of \nperjury.” Id. §20504(c)(2)(C)(iii). Completed applications “shall be made available (as submitted \nby the applicant, or in machine readable or other format) to the appropriate State election official \nas provided by State law.” Id. §20504(c)(2)(E). Information collected in connection with both \nchanges of address and online renewals “shall be transmitted to the appropriate State election \nofficial not later than 10 days after the date of acceptance.” Id. §20504(e)(1). \nThe Texas Legislature has provided for NVRA implementation at DPS as follows: \nThe Department of Public Safety shall provide to each person who applies in person \nat the department’s offices for an original or renewal of a driver’s license, a personal \nidentification card, or a duplicate or corrected license or card an opportunity to \ncomplete a voter registration application form. \n \nWhen  the  department  processes  a  license  or  card  for  renewal  by  mail,  the \ndepartment shall deliver to the applicant by mail a voter registration application \nform. \n \nA change of address that relates to a license or card and that is submitted to the \ndepartment in person or by mail serves as a change of address for voter registration \nunless  the  licensee  or  cardholder  indicates  that  the  change  is  not  for  voter \nregistration purposes. \n \nTEX. ELEC. CODE §20.063(a)-(c). \nTexas law further provides: \nAt the end of each day a [DPS] office is regularly open for business, the manager \nof the office shall deliver by mail or in person to the voter registrar of the county in \nwhich the office is located each completed voter registration application and \napplicable change of address submitted to a department employee. \n3 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 7   Filed 05/16/16   Page 4 of 21\n \nEach weekday the department is regularly open for business, the department shall \nelectronically transfer to the secretary of state the name of each person who \ncompletes  a  voter  registration  application  submitted  to  the  department.  The \nsecretary shall prescribe procedures necessary to implement this subsection. \n \nOn the weekday the [SOS] is regularly open for business following the date the \nsecretary receives information under Subsection (b), the secretary shall inform the \nappropriate voter registrar of the name of each person who completes a voter \nregistration application submitted to the department. The registrar may verify that \nthe registrar has received each application as indicated by the information provided \nby the secretary under this subsection. \n \nId. §20.065(a)-(c). \n \nSome licensees may renew their license or change their address online. This is permitted \nif, among other things, the applicant is a U.S. Citizen with a Social Security number on file who \nmost recently renewed in person.2 Because DPS’ online interface cannot capture an image of a \nvoter’s signature, those who utilize it receive a link to a voter registration application they must \nprint, sign and mail in order to update their voter registration. Compare P’s Ex. A at 2 (“Selecting \n‘yes’ does not register you to vote. A link to the [SOS] voter website (where a voter application \nmay be downloaded or requested) will be available on your receipt page.”) (emphasis original) \nwith P’s Ex. D. at 25 (voter registration application requiring signature). See also, e.g., 52 U.S.C. \n§20504(c)(2)(C)(iii) (voter registration applications must be signed); id. §20504(a)(1) (renewal is \nnot for voter registration purposes if applicant “fails to sign the voter registration application” or  \ndoes not meet other State requirements). \nII.  Plaintiffs’ Allegations \nPlaintiffs Benjamin Hernandez, Jarrod Stringer, Totysa Watkins, and John Woods claim to \nbe “eligible Texas voters who were directly and individually harmed by Defendants’ conduct.” \n                                                 \n2 Renew Online or by Phone, STATE OF TEXAS, https://www.txdps.state.tx.us/DriverLicense/ \ndlfork.aspx?action=renew (last accessed 16 May 2016). \n4 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 7   Filed 05/16/16   Page 5 of 21\nCompl. ¶16. Hernandez and Stringer claim that, after moving from one Texas county to another, \neach “updated his driver’s license address online, and believed that his voter registration records \nwere updated as well.” Compl. ¶¶46, 47. Watkins and Woods claim that, after moving from one \nTexas county to another, each “changed his [or her] driver’s license address online, and believed \nthat his [or her] voter registration records were updated as well.” Compl. ¶¶48, 49. \nNo Plaintiff claims to have submitted a signed voter registration application with updated \ninformation to DPS. Instead, Plaintiffs used the DPS website, which they describe as containing \neight steps. Compl ¶37. Step 5 requires the licensee to select “yes” or “no” beneath the statement \n“I want to register to vote.” Compl. ¶38, P’s Ex. A at 2. “Step 5 includes the following statement: \nSelecting ‘yes’ does not register you to vote. A link to the [SOS] voter website (where a voter \napplication may be downloaded or requested) will be available on your receipt page.” Compl ¶40; \nP’s Ex. A at 2 (emphasis original). Nevertheless, Plaintiffs claim they were unaware their voter \nregistration information was not updated after these online transactions. \nIn particular, Mr. Hernandez complains of having to cast a provisional ballot on Election \nDay 2014. Compl. ¶46. Mr. Stringer complains that he was unable to vote early in Bexar County \nin the 2014 election, and was only able to vote a statewide ballot. Compl. ¶47. Ms. Watkins \ncomplains she was not registered to vote in Dallas County on Election Day 2015. Compl. ¶48. Mr. \nWoods claims he cast a provisional ballot in Harris County on Election Day 2015.

Standards for Dismissal Under Rule 12(b) \nFederal Rule of Procedure 12(b)(1) governs motions to dismiss for lack of subject-matter \njurisdiction. When a court lacks the statutory or constitutional power to adjudicate a case, the case \nmust be dismissed for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. Hooks v. Landmark Indus., Inc., 797 F.3d \n309, 312 (5th Cir. 2015). The party asserting jurisdiction bears the burden of proving its existence. \nExelon Wind 1, L.L.C. v. Nelson, 766 F.3d 380, 388 (5th Cir. 2014). A court can find a lack of \nsubject-matter jurisdiction based on “(1) the complaint alone; (2) the complaint supplemented by \nundisputed facts; or (3) the complaint supplemented by undisputed facts plus the court’s resolution \nof disputed facts.” Johnson v. United States, 502 F. App’x 412, 414 (5th Cir. 2012). \nDismissal is proper under Federal Rule of Procedure 12(b)(6) when a complaint fails to \nstate a claim upon which relief can be granted. When reviewing a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, the court \naccepts all well-pleaded facts as true and views them in the light most favorable to the non-movant. \nCuvillier v. Sullivan, 503 F.3d 397, 401 (5th Cir. 2007). To survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, the \ncomplaint must provide “more than labels and conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of a cause \nof action’s elements.” Funk v. Stryker Corp., 673 F. Supp. 2d 522, 525 (S.D. Tex. 2009), aff’d 631 \nF.3d 777 (5th Cir. 2011) (citing Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007)). Instead, \nthe factual allegations must be enough to “raise a right of relief above the speculative level,” on \nthe assumption that the factual allegations are true. Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555. \nII.  This case should be dismissed under Rule 12(b)(1) for lack of jurisdiction. \n \nArticle III of the United States Constitution limits federal courts’ jurisdiction to actual “cases” \nand “controversies.” U.S. CONST. art. III, § 2; see also Breaux v. U.S. Postal Serv., 202 F.3d 820, 820 \n(5th Cir. 2000). It is settled that, “[i]n our system of government, courts have no business deciding \n6 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 7   Filed 05/16/16   Page 7 of 21\nlegal disputes or expounding on law in the absence of such a case or controversy.” Already, LLC v. \nNike, Inc., 133 S. Ct. 721, 726 (2013) (quotation marks omitted). The Supreme Court has “repeatedly \nheld that an ‘actual controversy’ must exist not only ‘at the time the complaint is filed,’ but through \n‘all stages’ of the litigation.” Id. (citing Alvarez v. Smith, 558 U.S. 87, 92 (2009); Arizonans for \nOfficial  English  v.  Arizona, 520  U.S.  43,  67  (1997).  In  addition  to  these  traditional standing \nrequirements, the NVRA imposes further standing requirements of its own. \na.  Plaintiffs lack Article III standing. \n \nThe purpose of the standing doctrine is to “give meaning to Article III’s case-or-controversy \nrequirement.” Sample v. Morrison, 406 F.3d 310, 312 (5th Cir. 2005). Standing is an essential \ncomponent of subject-matter jurisdiction. Id. To establish Article III standing, a plaintiff must show: \n(1) an injury-in-fact; (2) that is traceable to the defendant’s challenged conduct (causation); and \n(3) that is likely to be redressed by a favorable decision in the district court (redressability). Friends \nof the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Envtl. Servs., Inc., 528 U.S. 167, 180–81 (2000); see also Tex. \nDemocratic Party v. Benkiser, 459 F.3d 582, 585–86 (5th Cir. 2006). These elements are “an \nindispensable part of the plaintiff’s case.” Lujan v. Defs. of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 561 (1992). \nThe party seeking to invoke federal jurisdiction bears the burden of establishing all three elements. \nId. If a party lacks standing to bring a claim, the court lacks subject-matter jurisdiction over that \nclaim. See Crane v. Johnson, 783 F.3d 244, 251 (5th Cir. 2015). Here, the Plaintiffs lack standing \nbecause they have established neither causation nor redressability. \n1.  Plaintiffs’  alleged  injuries  are  not  fairly  traceable  to  conduct  of  the \nDefendants, and are instead the result of their own behavior. \n \nPlaintiffs’ alleged injuries do not satisfy the causation element necessary to establish \nArticle III standing. For an injury-in-fact to be fairly traceable to the challenged action of the \ndefendant, “there must be a causal connection between the injury and the conduct complained of.” \n7 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 7   Filed 05/16/16   Page 8 of 21\nLujan, 504 U.S. at 560. Relevant here, the Fifth Circuit has held that injury stemming from a \nplaintiff’s own inaction severs the causal link between that injury and any conduct of the defendant. \nWestfall v. Miller, 77 F.3d 868, 871-73 (5th Cir. 1996). So, too, here. \nIn  Westfall,  a  prospective  machine  gun buyer  challenged  a  federal  requirement  that \nmachine gun transferees submit a form to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (“ATF”). \nId. at 869-70. The form required certification from a local law enforcement official that the official \nhad no reason to believe the transferee would use the machine gun unlawfully. Id. Westfall \nrequested this certification from all law enforcement officials within a five-mile radius of his home, \nbut all refused. See id. at 869-70. ATF informed Westfall of other officials from whom he could \nseek the certification, but he “made no effort to obtain certifications from [those] officials[.]” Id. \nat 872. The Fifth Circuit concluded that Westfall lacked standing to challenge the constitutionality \nof the certification requirement. Id. at 871-72. The court reasoned that Westfall’s own inaction—\nmaking no effort to obtain the certification from other officials, despite being told specifically from \nwhom he could request it—caused any injury he claimed to have suffered. Id. at 872. The court \nnoted that the certification process may have been “cumbersome, frustrating, and inconvenient for \nthe plaintiff,” but was nonetheless required by applicable law. Id. \nAlthough the regulation challenged in Westfall involved different subject matter, a similar \nanalysis is appropriate here. Plaintiffs’ alleged injury occurred when each changed information on \nhis or her driver license online. Compl. ¶¶46-49. Each believed that his or her voter registration \nrecords would be updated the moment they made these changes. Id. Each apparently maintained \nthis belief despite the fact that the website they used required them to acknowledge that “[s]electing \n‘Yes’ does not register you to vote.” Compl. ¶40. \n8 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 7   Filed 05/16/16   Page 9 of 21\nBut Plaintiffs ignored the express indication that their voter registration information would \nnot be updated the moment they changed their driver license information online.3 They ignored \nthe instruction to print and mail a signed voter registration application. Yet, they blame Defendants \nfor the fact that this information was not updated. They do this despite their understanding that, \n“in order to register to vote, or to update address information, following an online transaction, an \neligible voter must…complete a [] voter registration form, print it…and mail it to the appropriate \ncounty registrar.” Compl. ¶41. Thus, the cause of Plaintiffs’ alleged injuries—like the cause of the \ninjuries  alleged  in  Westfall—was  their  own  inaction.  Plaintiffs  failed  to  follow  the  plain \ninstructions on the website upon completion of their driver’s license update: submit a signed \napplication to update their voter registration information. Thus, Plaintiffs’ subsequent allegations \nof inability to vote on Election Day are not fairly traceable to any conduct of Defendants.  \n2.  Because Plaintiffs allege only past injury, their claims are not redressable. \n \nFor an injury to be redressable, a plaintiff must show that a favorable decision would likely \nremedy it. Dep’t of Tex., Veterans of Foreign Wars v. Tex. Lottery Comm’n, 760 F.3d 427, 432 \n(5th Cir. 2014) (citation omitted). But the election in which each Plaintiff complains he or she was \nunregistered to vote has passed. Compl. ¶¶46-49. Defendants have made their best efforts to ensure \nthe Plaintiffs have all the information and assistance they might need in registering to vote.4 No \n                                                 \n3 Plaintiffs’ assertion that “eligible voters shall be registered to vote ‘simultaneously’ with the \nsubmission of any driver’s license application, renewal or change-of-address form,” Compl. ¶26 \n(citing 52 U.S.C. § 20503(a)(1)(1)), misstates the law. Instead, the NVRA requires each state to \n“establish procedures to register to vote in elections for Federal office by application made \nsimultaneously with an application for a motor vehicle driver’s license.” 52 U.S.C. §20503(a)(1). \nRequiring procedures for simultaneous application is not the same thing as requiring simultaneous \nupdates to the rolls. See also id. §20504(e)(1) (applicant information “shall be transmitted to the \nappropriate State election official not later than 10 days after the date of acceptance.”) \n4 In response to letters from Plaintiffs’ counsel alleging NVRA violations, SOS offered to verify \nindividuals’ voter registration statuses, “consistent with applicable confidentiality provisions[,]” \n9 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 7   Filed 05/16/16   Page 10 of 21\nPlaintiff has alleged that, today, he is not registered to vote in the county where he or she wishes \nto be registered. As a result, no relief from the Court could redress any harm alleged. \nb.  Plaintiffs’ claims are moot.  \n \nPlaintiffs lack the personal interest in this suit required to establish a case or controversy. \nMootness is “the doctrine of standing in a time frame.” Ctr. for Individual Freedom v. Carmouche, \n449 F.3d 655, 661 (5th Cir. 2006). If the controversy between a plaintiff and defendant has been \n“resolved to the point that they no longer qualify as adverse parties with sufficient legal interests \nto maintain the litigation,” a court lacks jurisdiction. Stauffer v. Gearhart, 741 F.3d 574, 582 (5th \nCir. 2014). That is, “[t]he requisite personal interest that must exist at the commencement of \nlitigation (standing) must continue throughout its existence (mootness).”United States Parole \nComm’n v. Geraghty, 445 U.S. 388, 397 (1980). Federal courts “have no power under Article III \nto decide the merits of a case that is moot when it comes before” them. Goldin v. Bartholow, 166 \nF.3d 710, 718 (5th Cir. 1999). A “controversy becomes moot where, as a result of intervening \ncircumstances, there are no longer adverse parties with sufficient legal interests to maintain the \nlitigation.” Perschall v. Louisiana, 174 F.3d 197 (5th Cir. 1999) (citation omitted).  \nPlaintiffs have not pleaded that they remain unregistered to vote. They have only pleaded \nthat they were not registered at a given address in the past (despite their mistaken belief to the \ncontrary). Defendants have worked diligently to ensure that each Plaintiff is registered where he \nor she wishes, and has ample information about voter registration in Texas. See generally P’s Ex. \n                                                 \nand to otherwise assist with questions about registration. P’s Ex. C at 27-28. Plaintiffs’ counsel \nprovided the information necessary to verify the registration status of some, but not all, of the \nindividuals named in their letters, and SOS again offered to assist. P’s Ex. C at 45. See also, e.g., \nP’s Ex. C at 47-48, Election Advisory No. 2015-07 (describing Defendants’ online portal where \ncounties may inquire about individual voters’ registration statuses, and reminding county election \nofficials about the portal’s operation). \n10 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 7   Filed 05/16/16   Page 11 of 21\nC.  Thus,  Plaintiffs  lack  concrete  or  continuing  injury  stemming  from  transactions  which, \nimproperly executed, Plaintiffs claim impacted their past ability to vote.5 Their claims are moot. \nIn an attempt to overcome mootness, Plaintiffs might invoke the “capable-of-repetition” \nexception to mootness, which applies “only in exceptional situations.” Spencer v. Kemna, 523 U.S. \n1, 17-18 (1998) (citations omitted). The capable-of-repetition exception applies where “(1) the \nchallenged action [is] in its duration too short to be fully litigated prior to cessation or expiration, \nand (2) there [is] a reasonable expectation that the same complaining party [will] be subject to the \nsame action again.” Id. This exception does not apply to this case, because it is not reasonable to \nexpect that the Plaintiffs will, in the future, again misunderstand the statement “Selecting ‘yes’ \ndoes not register you to vote.” Compl. ¶40. Thus, to the extent the alleged injuries are capable of \nrepetition, such repetition will similarly stem from the Plaintiffs’ future inaction, rather than any \nconduct of the Defendants. \nc.  Even if Plaintiffs otherwise had standing, the NVRA does not provide for \njurisdiction over this case. \n \nThe States and their officials—including the Defendants here—generally enjoy Eleventh \nAmendment immunity to suit in federal court, absent congressional waiver thereof. E.g., Pennhurst \nState School and Hospital v. Halderman, 465 U.S. 89, 97–98 (1984); Seminole Tribe of Florida v. \nFlorida, 517 U.S. 44, 64 (1996). The NVRA waives immunity for a suit filed by the United States \nAttorney General. 52 U.S.C. §20510(a). It waives immunity for private litigants as follows: \n[a] person who is aggrieved by a violation of this chapter may provide written \nnotice of the violation to the chief election official of the State involved. If the \nviolation is not corrected within 90 days after receipt of a notice…the aggrieved \nperson may bring a civil action in an appropriate district court for declaratory or \ninjunctive relief with respect to the violation. \n                                                 \n5 If Plaintiffs failed to avail themselves of the opportunity to properly register, their claims are not \nredressable. See infra Part II(a)(2). \n11 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 7   Filed 05/16/16   Page 12 of 21\n \nId. §20510(b)(1)-(2).6 \nEach individual plaintiff wishing to sue must give the requisite 90 day notice.7 Scott v. \nSchedler, 771 F.3d 831, 835-36 (5th Cir. 2014) (where NAACP provided notice to Louisiana \nSecretary of State, but individual plaintiff did not, the individual lacked standing under NVRA); \nACORN v. Fowler, 178 F.3d 350, 367 (5th Cir. 1999) (ACORN lacked standing to sue on behalf \nof its members where it had not shown any individual member had standing in his own right). \n“[T]he purpose of the notice requirement was to ‘provide states...an opportunity to attempt \ncompliance before facing litigation.’” Scott v. Schedler, 771 F.3d at 836 (quoting ACORN v. \nMiller, 129 F.3d 833, 838 (6th Cir.1997)) (alterations in Scott). \nNo Plaintiff has NVRA standing here because, to the extent any Plaintiff remains aggrieved \nby the Defendants’ actions, he or she has not provided the Defendants the opportunity to attempt \ncompliance. That is, Defendants have done all that they can to identify the putative NVRA \nviolations Plaintiffs allege in this lawsuit. Plaintiffs’ Exhibit C demonstrates Defendants’ repeated, \nconsistent, and good faith efforts to ensure that, in every regard, they are not only compliant with \nthe NVRA, but also that each individual voter who wished to register had every opportunity to do \nso. Some of the individuals on whose behalf Plaintiffs’ counsel wrote the Defendants refused to \n                                                 \n6 Less notice is required if the violation occurs closer to an election. 52 U.S.C. §20510(b)(2)-(3). \n7 The only exception is when a state has “‘clearly indicate[d] that [it] would continue to refuse to \ncomply with the [NVRA] until forced to do so by judicial intervention[.]’” Scott, 771 F.3d at 836 \n(quoting ACORN v. Miller, 129 F.3d at 838) (alterations in Scott). In ACORN v. Miller, for \nexample, notice was not required because a governor issued an executive order that state agencies \nwould not provide voter registration until federal funds were made available. Id. Where, as here, \nthe state “demonstrated desire to comply,” each plaintiff must give notice. Scott at 836. \n12 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 7   Filed 05/16/16   Page 13 of 21\nprovide the information that would allow SOS to verify their voter registration status, and SOS \nduly confirmed the other individuals’ registration status.8 \nUnder the NVRA’s limited waiver of immunity, Plaintiffs cannot merely refuse to allow \nthe State to attempt compliance, and insist upon federal court jurisdiction. Instead, where a state \nhas attempted to comply with the NVRA with respect to a particular plaintiff—so long as such \nattempt is not an “empty gesture”—that plaintiff does not have standing to invoke the Act’s limited \nwaiver of Eleventh Amendment immunity. \nIn this regard, Georgia State Conference of NAACP. v. Kemp is instructive. 841 F. Supp. \n2d 1320, 1335-36 (N.D. Ga. 2012) (citing Miller, 129 F.3d at 838). There, a given plaintiff lacked \nNVRA standing because—upon receipt of notice—“Georgia ha[d] attempted to comply with” the \nrelevant provisions of the NVRA “insofar as [the given plaintiff] was aggrieved[.]” Id. The court \nnoted “the State’s letter to [the plaintiff’s] counsel, which included a voter registration application \n[and] offer[ed] the assistance of the Secretary of State’s office.” Id. The court concluded that “the \nletter and application appear to be more than an empty gesture,” but instead were “Georgia’s \nattempt to comply with the NVRA with regard to [that plaintiff]. The pre-litigation notice was \nmeant to encourage exactly this sort of compliance attempt.” Id. \nSo, too, here. Any Plaintiff who provided the information necessary to verify his or her \nvoter registration status lacks standing, because he or she is either registered to vote, or has been \ngiven every opportunity to register. If a Plaintiff refused to provide information sufficient to verify \nhis or her registration, that Plaintiff necessarily did not provide the notice the NVRA requires, and \nlack standing to assert a claim under the Act. \n                                                 \n8 See supra n.4. Defendants made these efforts despite Plaintiffs’ counsel’s attempt to abuse this \nconciliation process to obtain impermissible pre-suit discovery from the public servants who were \nattempting to assist their clients. P’s Ex. C at 45-46. \n13 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 7   Filed 05/16/16   Page 14 of 21\nIII.  Plaintiffs do not state a claim under the NVRA or the Equal Protection Clause. \n \nThe allegations in the Complaint violate neither the NVRA nor the Equal Protection \nClause. Thus, even if the Court had jurisdiction, dismissal is appropriate because Plaintiffs have \nfailed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. FED. R. CIV. P. 12(b)(6). \nThe Elections Clause of the United States Constitution provides, “[t]he Times, Places and \nManner of holding Elections for Senators and Representatives, shall be prescribed in each State \nby the Legislature thereof; but the Congress may at any time by  Law make or alter such \nRegulations, except as to the places of chusing Senators.” U.S. CONST. art. I, §4 cl. 1. “The \nElections Clause has two functions. Upon the States it imposes the duty (‘shall be prescribed’) to \nprescribe the time, place, and manner of electing Representatives and Senators; upon Congress it \nconfers the power to alter those regulations or supplant them altogether.” Arizona v. Inter Tribal \nCouncil of Arizona, Inc., 133 S. Ct. 2247, 2253 (2013) (citation omitted). \nThis yields States significant latitude, absent specific Congressional directive. Indeed, \n“[t]he Clause’s substantive scope is broad. ‘Times, Places, and Manner,’ [the Supreme Court has] \nwritten, are ‘comprehensive words,’ which ‘embrace authority to provide a complete code for \ncongressional elections,’ including[,]” as relevant here, “regulations relating to ‘registration.’” Id. \nat 2253 (quoting Smiley v. Holm, 285 U.S. 355, 366 (1932)) (citing Roudebush v. Hartke, 405 U.S. \n15, 24–25, (1972) (recounts); United States v. Classic, 313 U.S. 299, 320 (1941) (primaries)). \na.  The conduct alleged in the Complaint does not violate the NVRA. \n \n“States employ different methods of identifying eligible voters at the polls.” Crawford v. \nMarion County Election Bd., 553 U.S. 181, 197 (2008). Some states “require voters to present \nregistration cards or other documentation before they can vote; some require voters to sign their \nnames so their signatures can be compared with those on file; and in recent years an increasing \n14 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 7   Filed 05/16/16   Page 15 of 21\nnumber of States have relied primarily on photo identification.” Id. Texas, among other things, \nrequires voters to sign a poll book. TEX. ELEC. CODE §63.002. In order to administer this provision \nof Texas law, an image of each voter’s signature must be on file with the county registrar, “so the \nsignature can be compared with those on file.” Crawford v. Marion County Election Bd., 553 U.S. \nat 197. See also TEX. ELEC. CODE §63.002; 1 TEX. ADMIN. CODE §81.58 (“a voter’s signature may \nbe captured by an electronic device for the signature roster. An ‘Electronic Signature’ is defined \nas a digitized image of a handwritten signature.”) Plainly, an image of a voter’s signature is \nnecessary “to enable State election officials to assess the eligibility of the applicant and to \nadminister voter registration and other parts of the election process,” 52 U.S.C. §20504(c)(2)(B). \nDefendants may therefore collect this image as they administer the NVRA. \nNevertheless, Plaintiffs claim that the NVRA required Texas to register them to vote \n“simultaneously” with their online driver license transactions. Compl. ¶26.9 They make this claim \ndespite the fact that none of them signed a voter registration application, and despite the fact that \nall of them indicated through the online interface that his or her change of address was not for \nvoter registration purposes. Compl ¶¶37-40, P’s Ex. A at 2. In other words, under Plaintiffs’ \nreading of the law, Texas must treat all “driver’s license renewal transactions as voter registration \napplications,” even where the applicant “fails to sign the voter registration application.” Compare \nCompl. Count II (capitalization altered) with 52 U.S.C. §20504(a)(1). Plaintiffs would further have \nstates treat all “driver’s license change-of-address transactions as updates for voter registration \npurposes,” even where the applicant “states on the form that the change of address is not for voter \n                                                 \n9 No Plaintiff claims to have renewed a license online. See Compl. ¶¶46-49 (Hernandez and \nStringer each claim to have “updated his driver’s license address online,” while Watkins and \nWoods each claim to have “changed his [or her] driver’s license address online”). Nevertheless, \nDefendants demonstrate that Plaintiffs’ arguments in this regard are without merit, should the \nCourt choose to exercise jurisdiction over those arguments. \n15 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 7   Filed 05/16/16   Page 16 of 21\nregistration  purposes.”  Compare  Compl.  Count  III  (capitalization  altered)  with  52  U.S.C. \n§20504(d). The NVRA does not provide for such a requirement. \nThe Fifth Circuit’s recent ruling in Scott v. Schedler is instructive here. 771 F.3d 831. The \ncourt considered whether Louisiana’s Secretary of State complied with NVRA’s requirement that \nvoter registration agencies administering public benefits “provide each applicant with voter \nregistration forms ‘unless the applicant, in writing, declines to register to vote.’” Id. at 840 (citing \nNVRA §7(a)(6)(A)) (codified at 52 U.S.C. §20506). The NVRA required the “voter registration \nagencies [administering public benefits] to provide all applicants with declination forms, which \nread: ‘If you are not registered to vote…would you like to apply to register to vote here today?’” \nId. On Louisiana’s form, “[t]here are then two boxes to check: yes or no.” Id. The form stated “‘IF \nYOU DO NOT CHECK EITHER BOX, YOU WILL BE CONSIDERED TO HAVE DECIDED \nNOT TO REGISTER TO VOTE AT THIS TIME.’” Id. The voter registration agencies governed \nby §7(a)(6)(A) did not provide individuals who did not check either box with a voter registration \napplication. Id. The Scott plaintiffs alleged that this violated the NVRA. \nIn rejecting this claim, the Fifth Circuit concluded, “[w]e hold that an applicant handing \nback a form with neither box checked has created documentation ‘in writing’ showing that he did \nnot wish to register.” Id. at 840 (citation omitted). The court “rel[ied] on the plain meaning of ‘IF \nYOU DO NOT CHECK EITHER BOX, YOU WILL BE CONSIDERED TO HAVE DECIDED \nNOT TO REGISTER TO VOTE AT THIS TIME.’ The capital letters mandated by the NVRA \ndrive home the importance of the message: not checking either box equals a decision not to register \nto vote.” Id. The court concluded, “[r]equiring that a declination be ‘in writing,’ rather than oral, \ncreates evidence showing that the state complied with the NVRA despite not distributing a voter \nregistration form.” Id. \n16 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 7   Filed 05/16/16   Page 17 of 21\nAlthough Scott arose under the NVRA provisions applicable to public benefits offices—\nrather than its “motor voter” provisions—the Fifth Circuit’s analysis in that case is instructive. \nUnder  the  “plain  meaning”  of  52  U.S.C.  §20504(a)(1),  without  a  signed  voter  registration \napplication, driver license renewals do not amount to applications for voter registration. It is \nsimilarly plain that, where a licensee changes their address and indicates that the change is not for \nvoter registration purposes, the change is not for voter registration purposes. Id. §20504(d). Texas \napplicants who acknowledge that “[s]electing ‘yes’ does not register you to vote[,]” like Louisiana \napplicants who are told “YOU WILL BE CONSIDERED TO HAVE DECIDED NOT TO \nREGISTER TO VOTE AT THIS TIME,” need not be registered. P’s Ex. A at 2; Scott, 771 F.3d \nat 840. Plaintiffs, therefore, have failed to articulate a plausible claim under the NVRA. \nGiven the jurisdictional bars to this lawsuit Plaintiffs may be motivated by a desire for \nTexas to implement an online voter registration program. But the NVRA contains no such \nrequirement. According to a recent survey, thirty-one states and the District of Columbia offered \nonline voter registration as of May 9, 2016.10 Legally, however, the NVRA does not require states \nto accept voter registrations over the internet.11 In fact, the United States Congress has considered \nseveral bills which would make online voter registration a requirement under the NVRA, and yet \nnone has become law.12 Obviously, if the NVRA already required States to provide online voter \n                                                 \n10 Online Voter Registration, NATIONAL CONFERENCE OF STATE LEGISLATURES, http://www. \nncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/electronic-or-online-voter-registration.aspx#table (last \naccessed 16 May 2016). \n11 Compare 52 U.S.C. §20501, et seq. (no provision for “remote” or online voter registration) with \nid. §20961 (establishing a “Technical Guidelines Development Committee” to assist in the \ndevelopment of “voluntary voting system guidelines” which include “remote access voting, \nincluding voting through the internet.”) (emphasis supplied). \n12 See, e.g., Voter Empowerment Act of 2015, H.R. 12, 114th Cong. (2015); Voter Empowerment \nAct of 2012, H.R. 5799/S. 3608, 112th Cong. (2012). \n17 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 7   Filed 05/16/16   Page 18 of 21\nregistration, such legislation would not continue to be proposed. Similarly, the Texas Legislature \nconsidered several online voter registration bills this past session (as well as their projected fiscal \nimpacts) and none became law.13 \nPlainly, Congress is aware that online voter registration exists, and that an increasing \nnumber of states have chosen to offer it to their citizens. Congress has not, however, required states \nto implement online voter registration under the NVRA. Leaving this choice to the states is \nconsistent with the broad election administration authority vested in them under the Constitution’s \nElections Clause, and a long line of Supreme Court precedent. E.g., Arizona v. Inter Tribal Council \nof Arizona, Inc., 133 S. Ct. 2247. Like the multiple other states that do not have online voter \nregistration, Texas is within its “time place and manner” prerogative in thus far declining to do so. \nThus, because Plaintiffs do not allege an NVRA violation, the Court should dismiss this \ncase for failure to state a claim. \nb.  The conduct alleged in the Complaint does not violate the Equal Protection \nClause, either. \n \nPlaintiffs seek relief under the Equal Protection Clause based upon the allegation that \nDefendants are “arbitrarily subjecting Plaintiffs to disparate voter registration standards[.]” Compl. \n¶59. “The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment commands that no State shall \n‘deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws,’ which is essentially a \ndirection that all persons similarly situated should be treated alike.” City of Cleburne, Tex. v. \nCleburne Living Ctr., 473 U.S. 432, 439 (1985) (quoting Plyler v. Doe, 457 U.S. 202, 215 (1982)). \nAs an initial matter, Plaintiffs have not identified similarly situated individuals who have \nbeen treated differently from them. That is, Plaintiffs have not identified other individuals who (1) \n                                                 \n13 See, e.g., H.B. 76, 84th Reg. Leg. Sess. (Tex. 2014); H.B. 953, 84th Reg. Leg. Sess. (Tex. 2014); \nS.B. 385, 84th Reg. Leg. Sess. (Tex. 2014). \n18 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 7   Filed 05/16/16   Page 19 of 21\nfailed to provide a signature, and (2) had their voter registration information updated after moving \nfrom one county to another. This is fatal to an equal protection claim. Nordlinger v. Hahn, 505 \nU.S. 1, 10 (1992). Moreover, as a factual matter, there is nothing “disparate” about requiring \nindividuals to provide a signature in order for the rolls to be updated. This requirement applies to \nall individuals, regardless of the artificial distinction Plaintiffs attempt to create here. \nIndeed, Plaintiffs claim that “Defendants’ current practices treat similarly situated voters \ndifferently based solely on how those voters choose to transact with DPS. The NVRA, which \nmakes  no  distinction  between  transaction  methods,  cannot  be  used  to  justify  this  arbitrary \ndiscrimination.” Compl. ¶7. Yet, the NVRA does require that voter registration applications be \nsigned. 52 U.S.C. §20504(c)(2)(C); id. §20504(a)(1). The NVRA further provides that transactions \nunder the Act also comport with State law. Id. §20504(d); TEX. ELEC. CODE §63.002; 1 TEX. \nADMIN. CODE §81.58. And State law expressly may impose a signature requirement. 52 U.S.C. \n§20504(c)(2)(C); Crawford v. Marion County Election Bd., 553 U.S. at 197. Because Texas law \ncontains such a requirement, it may require a signature in connection with a change of address. \nThus, it is not the fact that Plaintiffs utilized the website that caused their voter registration \ninformation not to be updated, it is the fact that they did not sign a voter registration application—\nas required for online changes between counties. Requiring all citizens to comply with the very \nsame requirement does not amount to a violation of the Equal Protection Clause. Thus, Plaintiffs \nhave not stated a claim under that Clause. \n \n \n \n \n19 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 7   Filed 05/16/16   Page 20 of 21\nCONCLUSION & PRAYER \nThe Court should dismiss this case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and for failure \nto state a claim upon which relief may be granted. \nRespectfully submitted, \n \nKEN PAXTON \nAttorney General of Texas \n \nJEFFREY C.

HUGHS, et al.,  § \nDefendants.  §   \n \n \n \nDEFENDANTS’ SUPPLEMENTAL BRIEF IN OPPOSITION TO PLAINTIFFS’ AND PLAINTIFF-\nINTERVENORS’ REQUEST FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \n \n \n  Plaintiffs and Plaintiff-Intervenors1 lack standing, and their claims are meritless. Plaintiffs’ \nsupplemental briefing (“Supp. Br.”) (ECF No. 69) does not present any new facts to alter this \nconclusion: they lack standing and their claims fail on the merits, they do not face irreparable harm, \nthe harm to the State from an expanded injunction would be substantial, and the public interest \nwould be disserved by granting Plaintiffs’ request.2 Accordingly, Defendants maintain that the \nCourt should not have entered the limited preliminary injunction that it did, and the Court should \nrefuse to entertain any further requests for injunctive relief, vacate its previous preliminary \ninjunction, and grant Defendants’ motions to dismiss as to all claims by all parties. \n                                            \n1 The Intervenors’ supplemental brief only addresses the issue of their standing. See ECF No. 70. \nDefendants have already filed a brief in support of their motion to dismiss which sets forth the \nevidence demonstrating that Intervenors should be dismissed. See ECF No. 73. Accordingly, this \nsupplemental brief is directed to the evidence regarding the original Plaintiffs’ standing and their \nrequest for preliminary injunction. \n \n2 See, e.g., Planned Parenthood of Hous. & Se. Tex. v. Sanchez, 403 F.3d 324, 329 (5th Cir. 2005) \n(listing the four preliminary injunction factors). \n1 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 74   Filed 05/22/20   Page 2 of 14\nI.  The Evidence \nA.  The Individual Plaintiffs \nJohn Harms had no plans to change his residence at the time he filed his declaration in this \nmatter or at the time of his deposition. See Harms Depo. at 34:2-7, 34:22-35:4 (attached hereto as \nExhibit A). He is currently registered to vote, and he has never been denied the ability to vote due \nto a registration issue. See id. at 19:12-16, 35:21-24. \nNayeli Gomez lives in a home that she owns, after having lived with family for over a \ndecade, and she has no plans to move. See Gomez Depo. at 13:13-15:6, 34:20-23 (attached hereto \nas Exhibit B). She is registered to vote at her current address. See id. at 29:23-30:10, 33:12-15. \nJarrod Stringer is also currently registered to vote. See Stringer Depo. at 21:17-18 (attached \nhereto as Exhibit C). But when he moved to Houston, he did not personally attempt to register to \nvote; rather, his wife did so for both of them. See id. at 27:21-28:4. Stringer had no knowledge of \nwhat his wife read or did during that process. See id. at 28:13-15, 30:21-24. Although Stringer says \nthat he intends to move, he has not yet given notice of terminating his lease at his current residence, \nand has not made any definite plans. See id. at 35:3-20. Though he does not know whether he or \nhis wife will update their voter registrations if they do ultimately move, Stringer will do whatever \nis necessary to register himself to vote. See id. at 37:5-7, 37:16-24. \nB.  League of Women Voters of Texas (“LWVTX”) \nVoter registration is a “vital part” of LWVTX and permeates every activity that the \norganization conducts. See LWVTX Depo. at 114:23-115:11 (attached hereto as Exhibit D). \nLWVTX’s  budget  does  not  separately  reflect  voter  registration  costs,  and  LWVTX  cannot \nseparately account for what it spends on its voter registration activities. See id. at 115:13-23, \n130:22-131:22. LWVTX’s outreach events are designed to have LWVTX volunteers interact with \n2 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 74   Filed 05/22/20   Page 3 of 14\nas many potential voters as possible, and volunteers will talk to anyone who approaches them, with \nno pre-screening or targeting of any kind—and no particular focus on individuals who may have \ntransacted with DPS online. See id. at 140:11-143:1. LWVTX does not track the method by which \nindividuals registered or attempted to register, see id. at 159:11-23, and therefore cannot quantify \nhow often its volunteers interact with someone who transacted with DPS online. Although \nLWVTX purports to have members, see, e.g., id. at 33:17-36:16, 44:24-48:20, it produced no \nevidence that suggests any of their members face a substantial risk of future injury from the \ncomplained-of conduct.3 \nC.  MOVE Texas  \nOne of MOVE’s primary aims is to engage in voter registration activities, and its volunteers \nand employees will help anyone who approaches them. See MOVE Texas Depo. at 111:19-22, \n138:20-139:1, 139:21-140:5, 142:19-143:5 (attached hereto as Exhibit E). MOVE does not track \nwhether the people that it registers to vote have recently moved (between counties or otherwise). \nSee id. at 88:15-23. It also does not separately track the amounts that it spends on voter registration \nactivities or the resources that it dedicates to registering individuals who may have transacted with \nDPS online. See id. at 37:14-21, 38:8-15, 39:8-21, 40:1-41:1, 123:24-124:3. And it has no record \nof ever assisting an individual who transacted with DPS online in registering to vote. Id. at 135:25-\n136:12. MOVE Texas does not purport to be a membership organization. \n \n                                            \n3 LWVTX produced a document that purports to show the number of members who have moved. \nSee LWVTX Depo. at 168:3-170:25; see also id. at Ex. 7 (Bates no. LWV-000327). This \ninformation  did  not  originate  from  LWVTX,  and  LWVTX  cannot  provide  any  additional \ninformation about any of these moves, such as the name of the member or where they moved. See \nid. And LWVTX offered no evidence whatsoever about the likelihood that any of its members will \nmove again in the future, be eligible to transact online with DPS, and choose to do so. See id.; see \nalso id. at 163:13-164:5. \n3 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 74   Filed 05/22/20   Page 4 of 14\nII.  Plaintiffs Cannot Demonstrate a Substantial Likelihood of Success \nAs explained in Defendants’ motion to dismiss, incorporated herein as if restated in full, \nsee ECF No. 60, this Court lacks jurisdiction over Plaintiffs’ claims and Plaintiffs have failed to \nstate a claim upon which relief may be granted. The evidence developed since that motion was \nfiled further supports Defendants’ position, particularly as it relates to Plaintiffs’ lack of standing. \nA.  The Individual Plaintiffs Lack Standing \nThe Fifth Circuit in Stringer I described the burden that the Individual Plaintiffs bear in \norder to demonstrate their standing: “Because injunctive and declaratory relief ‘cannot conceivably \nremedy any past wrong,’ plaintiffs seeking injunctive and declaratory relief can satisfy the \nredressability requirement only by demonstrating a continuing injury or threatened future injury.” \nStringer v. Whitley (Stringer I), 942 F.3d 715, 720 (5th Cir. 2019) (footnote omitted). “[W]hether \ncompliance with the NVRA would prevent future injury to others is irrelevant; plaintiffs seeking \ninjunctive relief must show a continuing or threatened future injury to themselves.” Id. at 721. The \nfact that the Individual Plaintiffs were not previously registered to vote when they transacted with \nDPS online to change their address or renew their driver licenses is irrelevant to their standing,4 \nbecause that alleged injury “was not a continuing or threatened future injury, but a past injury.” Id. \nAnd “evidence that Plaintiffs moved in the past” such that they needed to update their voter \nregistration “does not establish a substantial risk that they will do so in the future.” Id. at 722. \nHarms and Gomez have not expressed any intention to move in the future, as discussed \nabove, and they certainly did not have any such intention at the time they initiated this lawsuit. \n                                            \n4 And it is registering to vote—not the right to vote itself—that is at issue in this litigation. Nothing \nabout the process of interacting with DPS online prevents anyone from voting or from registering \nto vote in accordance with Texas law, and the Individual Plaintiffs’ right to vote is not impacted \nin any way by Defendants’ process for handling online DPS interactions. \n4 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 74   Filed 05/22/20   Page 5 of 14\nAccordingly, for the same reasons that the plaintiffs in Stringer I did not have standing, Harms \nand Gomez also lack standing. See id. (“Notably, no Plaintiff has expressed any intention to move \nin the future.”). With respect to Stringer, he does say that he intends to move again, but he has no \nconcrete plans to do so and has not yet given notice to terminate his lease. Moreover, Stringer does \nnot know whether he “will attempt to update [his] voter registrations using the DPS System and \nbe injured by [his] inability to do so.” Id. at 723. As he explained in his deposition, his wife may \nbe the one to interact with DPS online, as with their most recent move; he or his wife may choose \nto register by some other means; or he may be ineligible to transact with DPS online, if and when \nhe does change his residence. In light of this uncertainty, it cannot be said that Stringer has \n“established a substantial risk” that he will be injured again in the future, and therefore he has “not \nestablished an injury in fact sufficient to confer standing to pursue the declaratory and injunctive \nrelief that [he] seek[s].” Id.  And all three  Individual Plaintiffs are now registered to  vote. \nAccordingly, each Individual Plaintiff should be dismissed from this litigation for lack of standing. \nB.  The Organizational Plaintiffs Lack Standing \n1.  Neither Organization Has Standing in Its Own Right \nThe Organizational Plaintiffs are required to prove to this Court that they have suffered a \n“concrete and demonstrable injury to the organization’s activities—with the consequent drain on \nthe organization’s resources [that] constitutes far more than simply a setback to the organization’s \nabstract social interests.” Havens Realty Corp. v. Coleman, 455 U.S. 363, 379 (1982). “Not every \ndiversion of resources to counteract [a] defendant’s conduct, however, establishes an injury in \nfact.” NAACP v. City of Kyle, 626 F.3d 233, 238 (5th Cir. 2010). The alleged injury must be in \nsome way “different from the plaintiffs’ daily operations.” OCA-Greater Hous. v. Texas, 867 F.3d \n604, 612 (5th Cir. 2017) (citing City of Kyle, 626 F.3d 233); see also Common Cause/Ga. v. \n5 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 74   Filed 05/22/20   Page 6 of 14\nBillups, 554 F.3d 1350 (11th Cir. 2009) (holding that an organization can show standing if it \ndemonstrates that it “will divert resources from its regular activities” to counteract defendants’ \nallegedly illegal conduct). Mere “[f]rustration of an organization’s objectives is the type of abstract \nconcern that does not impart standing.” Ctr. for Law & Educ. v. Dep’t of Educ., 396 F.3d 1152, \n1161-62 (D.C. Cir. 2005) (quotation omitted). \nMoreover, Plaintiffs must show an explicit connection between the challenged practice and \nthe alleged injury. For example, in ACORN v. Fowler, 178 F.3d 350 (5th Cir. 1999), the plaintiff \norganization brought three claims challenging Louisiana’s voter registration practices on the \ntheory that they violated the NVRA. ACORN demonstrated that it “engages in voter registration \ndrives in Louisiana, that it provides voter registration applications to unregistered potential \nmembers, and that it makes voter registration applications available at housing fairs that it attends \nthroughout the year.” Id. at 359. ACORN also demonstrated that it “hired staff” to conduct voter \nregistration training, “coordinated voter registration drives,” and supervised staff, among other \nsimilar activities. Id. And ACORN claimed “that its efforts registering voters in  Louisiana \ncounteract the appellees’ failure to properly implement the NVRA.” Id. at 360. \nThe Fifth Circuit found that with respect its first two claims, ACORN had not demonstrated \nan injury. The court discounted much of ACORN’s evidence regarding its staff hiring and \nsupervision because ACORN did not show that these activities were “a direct result of Louisiana’s \nalleged failure to properly implement the NVRA.” Id. at 360. The court also doubted “ACORN’s \nallegations  of  injury  due  to  including  voter  registration  applications  with  its  membership \napplications or ‘set[ting] up’ a voter registration table at housing fairs that it already attends,” and \nfound that such activities did not constitute a perceptible impairment caused by the “purported \nfailure to implement the NVRA.” Id. (citing Havens Realty, 455 U.S. at 379). None of these \n6 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 74   Filed 05/22/20   Page 7 of 14\nactivities were held to have the requisite connection to the challenged activity that is necessary to \ndemonstrate organizational standing. See id. \nACORN was found to have raised a genuine issue of material fact regarding its third claim \nbecause it “concentrated” one voter registration drive to target specifically “a population directly \naffected  by  one  of  the  NVRA  requirements  that  ACORN  claims  Louisiana  has  failed  to \nimplement.” Id. at 361. The court found that ACORN was injured by having to conduct this highly \ntargeted voter registration effort because those resources were expended to register voters in a way \nthat specifically “counteract[ed] Louisiana’s alleged failure to implement the [NVRA].” Id. This \nwas the only injury that the court found to be “concrete and demonstrable” for standing purposes. \nId. at 362. But with respect to all of ACORN’s other voter registration activities, “[t]here is simply \nno suggestion in the record that anyone it has registered through its voter registration drives would \nalready have been registered to vote if Louisiana implemented the NVRA requirements that form \nthe basis of its first two claims.” Id. \nThe  evidence  does  not  demonstrate  that  any  of  the  Organizational  Plaintiffs’  voter \nregistration activities are conducted specifically to counteract Defendants’ alleged practices. \nUnlike ACORN’s evidence regarding its third claim, which suggested that it may have been \ninjured to the limited extent that some of its efforts were “concentrated” to reach a specific group, \nsee id. at 361, neither LWVTX nor MOVE Texas conduct targeted voter registration activities \ndirected at individuals who transacted with DPS online. Instead, as discussed above, the evidence \ndemonstrates that any voter registration activities the Organizational Plaintiffs undertake are \ndesigned to reach as many people as possible, and nobody who wants to engage with LWVTX’s \nor MOVE Texas’s volunteers or employees is ever turned away. Accordingly, their activities are \nnot specifically connected to the challenged practices. \n7 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 74   Filed 05/22/20   Page 8 of 14\nVoter registration activities are a key aspect of all of LWVTX’s and MOVE Texas’s \nactivities. Accordingly, the Organizational Plaintiffs cannot show that any of their activities are “a \ndirect result of [Texas’s] alleged failure to properly implement the NVRA.” Id. at 360 (emphasis \nadded). None of the evidence shows any voter registration activities directed at those who \ntransacted online with DPS. Indeed, neither LWVTX nor MOVE Texas can offer proof showing \nhow many individuals—if any at all—“would already have been registered to vote if [Texas] \nimplemented the NVRA requirements that form the basis of its . . . claims.” Id. at 362; see supra, \nPart I. Nor can they state in any “concrete and demonstrable” way what resources they have \ndevoted to counteracting Defendants’ conduct. \nThe  Organizational  Plaintiffs  essentially  argue  that  because  they  engage  in  voter \nregistration activities generally, they have standing to challenge any voter registration practice \nwith which they disagree or which does not align with their preferred policy. But this is not the \nlaw. LWVTX and MOVE Texas must each show a “concrete and demonstrable” injury, Havens \nRealty, 455 U.S. at 379, yet they cannot identify even one dollar that was spent or one voter that \nwas registered as a result of their efforts to counteract this particular practice. None of their \npurported activities constitute anything other their routine “daily operations,” OCA-Greater Hous., \n867 F.3d at 612, and they will continue to engage in these voter registration activities regardless \nof whether Defendants change their conduct. Accordingly, the Organizational Plaintiffs have not \nshown that they have suffered a concrete and demonstrable injury as a result of Defendants’ \npractices, and they do not have standing to bring their claims. \n  2.  LWVTX Does Not Have Associational Standing \nTo the extent that LWVTX claims standing to vindicate its members’ injuries, it also fails. \n“‘Standing,’  [the  Supreme  Court  has]  said,  ‘is  not  ‘an  ingenious  academic  exercise  in  the \n8 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 74   Filed 05/22/20   Page 9 of 14\nconceivable’ . . . [but] requires . . . a factual showing of perceptible harm.’” Summers v. Earth \nIsland Inst., 555 U.S. 488, 499 (2009) (quoting Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 566 \n(1992)). The Supreme Court “has required plaintiffs claiming an organizational standing to \nidentify members who have suffered the requisite harm.” Id. But LWVTX cannot identify any \nsuch member. The evidence it produced shows, at most, that it has some members in Texas who \nhave moved residences in the past. It is not enough for LWVTX to speculate that because its \nmembers have moved in the past, they may move in the future. See Stringer I, 942 F.3d at 722.  \nLWVTX does not possess the required substantial risk of harm, because even if it is “possible—\nperhaps even likely—that one individual will meet all of these criteria, that speculation does not \nsuffice.” Summers, 555 U.S. at 499. Without an identified or identifiable member that has standing, \nLWVTX’s assertion of associational standing must fail. \nIII.  Plaintiffs Have Not Shown Irreparable Harm \nAs explained in Defendants’ opposition to Plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunction, \nECF No. 36 (“PI Opp.”), any eligible Texan who wishes to vote has ample time and means to \nregister,  and  this  Court’s  declination  to  enter  an  unmerited  preliminary  injunction  will  not \ndisenfranchise any voter. LWVTX even explains on its website that “[v]oters who move to a new \naddress within the same county or changed your name while remaining in the same county . . . can \nupdate your information online,” and “[y]ou may fill out a voter registration application and have \nit mailed to you at register2vote.org or from the Secretary of State.” “Register to Vote,” LWV.org, \nhttps://my.lwv.org/texas/voting-elections/register-vote (last visited May 22, 2020). \nMOVE Texas’s assertion that it is “forced to expend money to mail voter registration \napplications,” Supp. Br. at 11, is therefore patently false, because anyone can request from the \nSecretary of State a postage-paid voter registration application, free of charge. See “Where to Get \n9 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 74   Filed 05/22/20   Page 10 of 14\nan  Application,”  VoteTexas.gov,  https://www.votetexas.gov/register-to-vote/where-to-get-an-\napplication-2.html (last visited May 22, 2020); “Request for Postage-Paid Voter Registration \nForm,”  Texas  Secretary  of  State,  https://webservices.sos.state.tx.us/vrrequest/index.asp  (last \nvisited May 22, 2020).  \nMoreover, Plaintiffs’ substantial delay in pursuing this supposedly “emergency” relief has \nonly been magnified over the four months since they first moved for a preliminary injunction, \neliminating any pretense that Plaintiffs will be irreparably injured if they are forced to litigate their \nclaims in the normal course. See PI Opp. at 9-12. The extraordinary relief of a mandatory \npreliminary injunction against the officials of a sovereign state is not warranted here, where the \nstatus quo has been in place for years and where individuals have ample means and opportunity to \nregister to vote. See, e.g., Machete Prods., L.L.C. v. Page, 809 F.3d 281, 288 (5th Cir. 2015); \nRoark v. Individuals of the Fed. Bureau of Prisons, Former and Current, 558 F. App’x 471, 472 \n(5th Cir. 2014). Accordingly, Plaintiffs cannot satisfy their burden with respect to demonstrating \nirreparable harm. \nIV.  The Other Relevant Factors Weigh Against Preliminary Injunctive Relief \nThe harm to the State that would be caused by an expanded preliminary injunction \noutweighs any alleged harm to Plaintiffs (none of which is legally cognizable, as described above), \nand the public interest would be disserved by granting Plaintiffs’ requested relief.5 The Supreme \nCourt “has repeatedly emphasized that lower federal courts should ordinarily not alter the election \nrules on the eve of an election.” Republican Nat’l Comm. v. Democratic Nat’l Comm., 140 S. Ct. \n                                            \n5 The two factors of “assessing the harm to the opposing party and weighing the public interest . . . \nmerge when the Government is the opposing party.” Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 435 (2009). \nAccordingly, it is appropriate for the Court to consider these factors together, as Defendants are \nofficials acting in their official capacities as agents of the State.   \n10 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 74   Filed 05/22/20   Page 11 of 14\n1205, 1207 (2020). “Court orders affecting elections . . . can themselves result in voter confusion \nand consequent incentive to remain away from the polls. As an election draws closer, that risk will \nincrease.” Id. at 4-5. This Court has already recognized, at least implicitly, that the proximity to an \nelection—now  the  July  primary  runoff  elections,  see  Supp.  Br.  at  16—weighs  in  favor  of \nexercising restraint. See ECF No. 46 at 7. Particularly after Plaintiffs’ extended and unjustifiable \ndelay in even bringing their claims, Plaintiffs’ request for this Court to enter systemic relief in the \nmidst of a presidential election cycle ignores the Supreme Court’s measured warning. \nThe State and its citizens also have a weighty interest in the enforcement of Texas law. \nMaryland v. King, 567 U.S. 1301, 1303 (2012) (“[A]ny time a State is enjoined by a court from \neffectuating statutes enacted by representatives of its people, it suffers a form of irreparable \ninjury.”) (quoting New Motor Vehicle Bd. of Cal. v. Orrin W. Fox Co., 434 U.S. 1345 (1977)). The \n“inability [for a State] to enforce its duly enacted [laws] clearly inflicts irreparable harm on the \nState.” Abbott v. Perez, 138 S. Ct. 2305, 2324 n.17 (2018); Planned Parenthood of Greater Tex. \nSurgical Health Servs. v. Abbott, 734 F.3d 406, 419 (5th Cir. 2013) (recognizing that, when a duly \nenacted law cannot be enforced, “the State necessarily suffers the irreparable harm of denying the \npublic interest in the enforcement of its laws”). This interest cannot be discounted simply because \nPlaintiffs read the NVRA to require something Texas law does not contemplate, particularly \nbecause Texas law and practice fully comport with the NVRA and the U.S. Constitution. See, e.g., \nECF No. 60 at 17-25. \nForcing the State to accept online transactions that are not themselves done under the \nsignature of the voter registration applicant—a requirement that exceeds the State’s obligations \nunder the NVRA—undermines the will of the people as expressed through their duly elected \nlegislators. Especially where, as here, the current laws and system have been in place for years, \n11 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 74   Filed 05/22/20   Page 12 of 14\nthe Court should not disregard Texas law and risk injecting more turmoil into an election cycle \nthat is already presenting immense and unprecedented challenges resulting from the COVID-19 \npandemic. Accordingly, the equitable factors also weigh against the entry of a preliminary \ninjunction. \nV.  Plaintiffs’ Requested Relief \nEven if the Court were to entertain the possibility of expanding its previous preliminary \ninjunction—which it should not—the relief requested by Plaintiffs continues to be problematic. \nThankfully they have abandoned their expensive, time-consuming, and unworkable request for \ncourt-ordered, pre-populated mailings. See, e.g., Supp. Br. at 2. But Plaintiffs still are under the \nimpression that Defendants can register someone to vote. See id. at 18-19 ¶ 3 (requesting an order \nthat Defendants “ensure” individuals are “properly registered”). Defendants cannot comply with \nthis proposed requirement—registering voters is an authority entrusted solely to local voter \nregistrars under state law. See Tex. Elec. Code. §§ 12.001, 13.071; see also ECF No. 36-3 ¶ 8 \n(Ingram Decl.). Defendants were previously ordered only to provide information and instruction \nto the county voter registrars, see ECF No. 46 at 17, and that is what Defendants did, see ECF No. \n48.  But  Defendants  cannot  compel  a  county  voter  registrar  to  accept  a  voter  registration \napplication. \nSimilarly, Plaintiffs continue to ignore uncertainties and minimize work that would need \nto be performed to achieve what they ask. For example, Plaintiffs allude vaguely to “a not-fully-\nautomatic process” without any explanation of what is meant, see Supp. Br. at 17, and Plaintiffs \nseek to impose a June 5, 2020 deadline without any explanation of how that could be accomplished, \nsee id. at 19 ¶ 4. Defendants have in good faith provided explanations and information to Plaintiffs \nand to the Court about their projections regarding what work may be required for Plaintiffs’ \n12 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 74   Filed 05/22/20   Page 13 of 14\nproposed modifications and about estimations of the time needed to perform that work. But \nuncertainty nonetheless remains, and Defendants have been forthcoming about known areas of \nuncertainty. See, e.g., Supp. Br. at 6 & n.16 (noting SOS has explained that additional changes to \na database may be necessary depending on the scope of any relief that may be ordered). If the \nCourt does decide to expand its preliminary injunction—which it should not—then it should at \nleast order only relief that is possible, based on an achievable timeframe and recognizing that the \nunexpected may arise. \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court should refuse to entertain any further requests for \ninjunctive relief, vacate its previous preliminary injunction, and grant Defendants’ motions to \ndismiss as to all claims by all parties. \n   \n13 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 74   Filed 05/22/20   Page 14 of 14\nRespectfully submitted. \n \nKEN PAXTON \nAttorney General of Texas \n \nJEFFREY C.

HUGHS, et al.,  § \nDefendants.  §   \n \nDEFENDANTS’ RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION TO INTERVENORS’ MOTION FOR SUMMARY \nJUDGMENT AND COUNTER-MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT DISMISSING INTERVENORS \n \nIntervenors1 lack standing and their sole claim is meritless. Their Motion for Summary \nJudgment, Dkt. 77—which presents no new facts or authority to alter this conclusion—should be \ndenied, and the Court should enter summary judgment dismissing Intervenors from this case.  \nFACTUAL BACKGROUND \nI.  Texas Voter Registration  \nVoter  registration  in  Texas  is  governed  by  a carefully  considered  statutory  framework. \nImportantly here, “[a] registration application must be in writing and signed by the applicant.” TEX. \nELEC. CODE § 13.002(b); see also id. § 65.056(a) (allowing the affidavit on a provisional ballot to serve \nas a voter-registration application if it contains the necessary information). Likewise, any request to \nchange voter-registration information must also be in writing and signed.  Id. § 15.021(a). The \nsignatures may then be used for, inter alia, investigations of fraud or identity theft, consideration of \nabsentee ballots, or if there are any problems with electronically captured signatures. Stringer I, No. \n5:16-cv-00257 (W.D. Tex.) (“Stringer I”), Dkt. 77-1 at 82; 80-1 at 61, 71-72.2  \n                                            \n1  “Plaintiff-Intervenors”  or  “Intervenors”  refers  to  the  Democratic  Senatorial  Campaign  Committee  (“DSCC”), \nDemocratic Congressional Campaign Committee (“DCCC”), and Texas Democratic Party (“TDP”).  \n2 See also, e.g., TEX. ELEC. CODE §§ 87.041(e), (f); 87.027(i) (providing for use of voter-registration signatures to verify \nauthenticity of signatures provided with mail-in-ballots). \n1 \n \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 78   Filed 06/12/20   Page 2 of 22\n \nThe only exception to the signature requirement is when a voter moves within a single county, \nin which case Texas law provides for the voter to change his voter-registration address online. TEX. \nELEC. CODE § 15.021(d). If, however, a voter moves between counties, he must fill out a voter-\nregistration form, sign it, and submit it to his new county of registration. Id. § 15.021(a); see also Stringer \nI, Dkt. 105 at 17-18. This is because Texas uses a county-based voter-registration system: the voter \nregistrar in each county is the county tax assessor-collector, county elections administrator, or county \nclerk. TEX. ELEC. CODE § 12.001. Each registrar is tasked with accepting and rejecting voter-\nregistration applications and maintaining files of voter-registration applications. Id. § 13.071, .101. \nTexans have multiple options for registering to vote and updating existing registrations, \nincluding by having a postage-paid voter-registration form mailed to them at no cost.3, Texans can \nalso register to vote and update existing registrations while applying for, renewing, or changing the \naddress on a driver license with the Department of Public Safety (“DPS”). Paper applications for new \nlicenses, renewals, or changes of address contain boxes allowing the individual to check “Yes” or \n“No” regarding whether he wants to register to vote or change his registration address, and require \nthe signature of the applicant. Stringer I, Dkt. 77-1 at 53-60; see also TEX. ELEC. CODE § 20.062. \nAn original application for a Texas driver license must be made in person, TEX. TRANSP. CODE \n§ 521.142, and the applicant must provide his signature on the paper application, 37 TEX. ADMIN. \nCODE § 15.21. The applicant must also provide a written signature on a device that electronically \ncaptures the image of that signature.  Stringer  I,  Dkt. 80-1 at 74-75.  Texas law authorizes this \nelectronically captured signature to be sent to the Secretary of State (“SOS”), which provides it to the \nappropriate county for voter-registration purposes. TEX. ELEC. CODE § 20.066(a); Stringer I, Dkt. 77-\n                                            \n3 See “Request for Postage-Paid Voter Registration Form,” Texas Secretary of State, https://webservices.sos.state.tx.us/ \nvrrequest/index.asp (last visited June 12, 2020). \n2 \n \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 78   Filed 06/12/20   Page 3 of 22\n \n1 at 53-57. The previously captured signature is also sent to SOS when an individual later registers to \nvote when renewing his license or changes his address by mail. Id., Dkt. 105 at 13-14. \nEach weekday, DPS electronically transfers to SOS information about each applicant who is \nof voting age, a United States citizen, and affirmatively answers the voter-registration question through \nan in-person or mail-in driver license transaction. Id., Dkt. 105 at 4, 9. The signature that is transferred \nto SOS is the electronic signature captured during the individual’s last in-person transaction in a driver-\nlicense office. Id., Dkt. 94-8 at 12; 94-10 at 9.  \nThough original license applications must be submitted in person, Texans who meet statutory \neligibility criteria have the option to renew or change the address on their driver license online through \nthe DPS website. Id., Dkt. 77-1 at 143.4 Individuals who conduct an online transaction also have an \nopportunity to register to vote or update an existing registration. The online interface asks the \nindividual “Do you want to request a voter application?” Id., Dkt. 77-1 at 146. Next to the box marked \n“Yes,” it states, “This does not register you to vote.” Id. Instead, the website explains, “You will receive \na link to a voter application on your receipt page.” Id. When the individual completes his online \ntransaction, a notice in red appears at the top of the page stating, “You are not registered to vote until \nyou have filled out the online application, printed it, and mailed it to your local County Voter \nRegistrar.” Id., Dkt. 77-1 at 149. The notice also contains a link to download, complete, and mail a \nvoter-registration application. Id.  \nII.  The Intervenors \n  Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss, Dkt. 73, incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein, \nsets out evidence regarding Intervenors. Defendants summarize but do not belabor that evidence here. \n                                            \n4 For brevity, online driver license renewals and changes of address are hereinafter referred to as “online transactions.” \n3 \n \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 78   Filed 06/12/20   Page 4 of 22\n \nTDP is a partisan political organization whose singular mission is to elect Democrats to public \noffice. TDP Dep. 22:1-13 (attached hereto as Exhibit A). In the course of its efforts to elect \nDemocrats, TDP works to register voters who TDP thinks—based on sophisticated, proprietary data \nanalytics—will vote for Democrats. Id. 48:1-2 & 17, 57:2-11, 64:6-18. TDP undertakes these efforts \nnot to register voters who have transacted with DPS online, but to “win an election” by targeting \nDemocratic voters. Id. 69:2-6; see also id. 48:1-2 & 17, 57:2-11, 64:6-18, 69:2-6. TDP has no evidence \nthat it has registered even a single voter after a DPS online transaction. Id. 101:18-22. \nTDP also cannot identify any specific activity it would pursue if it did not work to register \nDemocratic voters, and it is impossible for TDP to determine the resources expended on these efforts. \nId. 45:14-21, 101:1-4. No TDP donor has contributed funds specified for voter-registration efforts—\nnor could they. Id. 59:21-60:3. And even if TDP could be regarded as a “membership” organization \n(it cannot, see infra, I(C)), it cannot identify a single member who plans to renew or change the address \non their driver license through an online transaction (or has done so in the past). Id. 108:21-109:6. \nDCCC is a national organization whose purpose is to elect Democrats to the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives. DCCC Dep. 6:19-24, 42:16-43:2 (attached hereto as Exhibit B). DCCC claims to \nhave supported voter-registration activities but cannot identify any resources used for such activities \nin past election cycles. Id. 77:10-18, 78:23-79:20. For this election cycle, DCCC speculates that funds \nit provided to TDP and to a vendor for consulting and training services could have supported voter-\nregistration efforts. Id. 81:5-14, 82:10-22. But DCCC’s sole targets for voter registration are “voters \nwho are likely to support Democratic candidates or vote for Democrats.” Id. 89:4-16. DCCC has no \nevidence that, in the course of pursuing its mission to elect Democrats to Congress, it has registered \neven a single voter who completed a DPS online transaction. Id. 98:2-8, 101:17-21. \nDCCC does not know what percentage of its staff’s time is spent on voter-registration efforts, \nwhich are commingled with other organizational objectives targeted to elect Democratic congressional \n4 \n \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 78   Filed 06/12/20   Page 5 of 22\n \ncandidates, such as voter persuasion. Id. 84:8-10, 85:22-86:23. Nor can DCCC identify the cost of \nregistering any new voter. Id. 88:8-24. DCCC considers its members to be the Democratic members \nof Congress, id. 108:2-109:5, and it has produced no evidence that any of those members are eligible \nand intend to conduct online transactions with DPS. \nDSCC’s sole mission is to elect Democratic candidates to the U.S. Senate. DSCC Dep. 21:6-\n14  (attached  hereto  as  Exhibit  C).  DSCC  accomplishes  this  mission  by,  among  other  things, \ntransferring funds to state-level Democratic Party organizations, which may use that money however \nthey wish. Id. 30:2-13. DSCC did not transfer any funds to TDP in past election cycles. Id. 39:23-40:8. \nAnd it provided no evidence that any funds invested in Texas in past election cycles were used for \nvoter-registration efforts. Id. 39:23-40:8, 41:8-12. \nDSCC has made three investments in Texas this election cycle, but there is no evidence that \nany of those funds were used for voter registration. Id. 39:13-21. Instead, DSCC supported polling \nefforts unrelated to voter registration, id. 38:24-39:3, and contributed the maximum amount to the MJ \nHegar campaign, to be used at the campaign’s discretion, id. 30:17-31:3. It did not contribute anything \nto TDP until after filing this lawsuit, id. Ex. 5, and it cannot show that any of those funds were used \nto register voters (let alone how much, or whether any funds were used to register voters who had \ninteracted with DPS online), id. 30:2-13. Moreover, DSCC produced no evidence regarding whether \nit has any members at all, and certainly has not identified any members who are eligible and intend to \nengage in an online transaction with DPS. \nSUMMARY JUDGMENT STANDARD \nSummary judgment is appropriate if no genuine issue of material fact exists and the movant is \nentitled to judgment as a matter of law. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322–23 (1986). A movant \nwho would not bear the burden of proof at trial need not present evidence to put the plaintiff’s claims \nin issue. Id. at 325. Rather, a defendant need only “point[ ] out…that there is an absence of evidence \n5 \n \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 78   Filed 06/12/20   Page 6 of 22\n \nto support the nonmoving party’s case.” Id. Once the defendant meets this obligation, the burden \nshifts to the plaintiff to produce competent evidence. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 256–\n57 (1986). To survive summary judgment, a plaintiff must demonstrate a genuine issue of material fact \nas to each element of every disputed claim. Id. at 247–48. A genuine issue of material fact exists “if \nthe evidence is such that a reasonable jury could enter a verdict for the nonmoving party.” Id. \nTo meet her summary judgment burden, a plaintiff cannot rely on unsupported or conclusory \nassertions, speculation, or subjective belief. Lawrence v. Fed. Home Loan Mortg. Corp., 808 F.3d 670, 673 \n(5th Cir. 2015); Auguster v. Vermilion Parish Sch. Bd., 249 F.3d 400, 403 (5th Cir. 2001). Rather, she \n“must go beyond the pleadings and come forward with specific facts” demonstrating a genuine issue \nfor trial —and the evidence must be admissible. Brandon v. Sage Corp., 808 F.3d 266, 270 (5th Cir. 2015) \n(citation and quotation marks omitted); Mersch v. City of Dall., Tex., 207 F.3d 732, 734–35 (5th Cir. \n2000). “Where critical evidence is so weak or tenuous on an essential fact that it could not support a \njudgment in favor of the nonmovant, or where it is so overwhelming that it mandates judgment in \nfavor of the movant, summary judgment is appropriate.” Alton v. Tex. A&M Univ., 168 F.3d 196, 199 \n(5th Cir. 1999). Summary judgment also is proper when a plaintiff’s evidence is “merely colorable” or \nis not “significantly probative.” Anderson, 477 U.S. at 249–50. \nARGUMENT AND AUTHORITY \nI.  Intervenors Lack Standing. \n \nJurisdiction is “a threshold issue that must be resolved before any federal court reaches the \nmerits of the case before it.” Perez v. U.S., 312 F.3d 191, 194 (5th Cir. 2002); Steel Co. v. Citizens for a \nBetter Env’t, 523 U.S. 83, 94–95 (1998). “[S]tanding is perhaps the most important of the jurisdictional \ndoctrines.” FW/PBS, Inc. v. City of Dallas, 493 U.S. 215, 231 (1990) (internal quotation omitted). To \nestablish standing, a plaintiff must show: (1) an actual or imminent, concrete and particularized \n“injury-in-fact”; (2) that is fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant (causation); and \n6 \n \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 78   Filed 06/12/20   Page 7 of 22\n \n(3) that is likely to be redressed by a favorable decision (redressability). Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. \nLaidlaw Envt’l Servs., 528 U.S. 167, 180–81 (2000). Each element is “an indispensable part of the \nplaintiff’s case” which plaintiff bears the burden to establish; otherwise, the plaintiff is dismissed \nfrom the case without regard to the merits. Lujan v. Defs. of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 561 (1992). \nA.  Intervenors Lack Statutory Standing. \n \nIntervenors’ sole claim—violation of the Equal Protection Clause with respect to voting—is \none they lack statutory standing to maintain. See Lexmark Int’l, Inc. v. Static Control Components, Inc., 572 \nU.S. 118, 128 n.4 (2014) (explaining statutory standing). Section 1983 provides a cause of action only \nwhere a plaintiff suffers “the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the \nConstitution and laws.” 42 U.S.C. § 1983. It does not provide a cause of action to plaintiffs claiming \nan injury based on the violation of a third party’s rights. See, e.g., Coon v. Ledbetter, 780 F.2d 1158, 1160 \n(5th Cir. 1986) (“[L]ike all persons who claim a deprivation of constitutional rights, [plaintiffs] were \nrequired to prove some violation of their personal rights.”). \nThus, under § 1983, a plaintiff “must assert [her] own legal rights and interests, and cannot \nrest [her] claim to relief on the legal rights or interests of third parties.” Danos v. Jones, 652 F.3d 577, \n582 (5th Cir. 2011) (quoting Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 499 (1975)). When “[t]he alleged rights at \nissue” belong to a third party, rather than the plaintiff, the plaintiff lacks statutory standing, regardless \nof Article III standing. Id.; see also Conn v. Gabbert, 526 U.S. 286, 292–93 (1999) (holding that lawyer \n“clearly had no standing” to bring § 1983 claim for injury suffered as a result of “the alleged \ninfringement of the rights of his client” because a plaintiff “generally must assert his own legal rights \nand interests, and cannot rest his claim to relief on the legal rights or interests of third parties.”). \nAs artificial entities, TDP, DCCC, and DSCC do not have voting rights. “It goes without \nsaying that political parties, although the principal players in the political process, do not have the right \nto vote.” Vieth v. Pennsylvania, 188 F. Supp. 2d 532, 546 (M.D. Pa. 2002); see also Concerned Home Care \n7 \n \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 78   Filed 06/12/20   Page 8 of 22\n \nProviders, Inc. v. Cuomo, 783 F.3d 77, 91 (2d Cir. 2015) (“But Plaintiffs—five corporations and a not-\nfor-profit trade organization—are not entitled to vote and have no right to equal representation in the \nlegislature.”) Since Intervenors are asserting third parties’ rights, they lack standing under § 1983. \nB.  Intervenors Lack Organizational Standing. \n \nThat an organization has an “interest in a problem . . . is not sufficient” for standing, “no \nmatter how longstanding the interest and no matter how qualified the organization is in evaluating the \nproblem.” Sierra Club v. Morton, 405 U.S. 727, 739 (1972). Rather, an organization has standing only if \nit satisfies the same Article III requirements of injury-in-fact, causation, and redressability applicable \nto individuals. NAACP v. City of Kyle, Texas, 626 F.3d 233, 237 (5th Cir. 2010) (citing Lujan, 504 U.S. \nat 560–61). And each plaintiff must have standing not only throughout the life of the litigation, but at \nthe time they filed suit. Pluet v. Frasier, 355 F.3d 381, 386 (5th Cir. 2004); Soc’y of Separationists, Inc. v. \nHerman, 959 F.2d 1283, 1288 (5th Cir. 1992).5 Intervenors fail this analysis on at least two factors.6 \ni.  Injury-in-fact \nIntervenors allege injury on the theories of (1) injury to the “electoral prospects of their \ncandidates,”  and  (2)  “diversion  of  [Intervenors’]  resources.”  Both  fail.  As  to  the  first  theory, \nIntervenors offer no evidence of any impact whatsoever on the electoral prospects of any Democratic \ncandidate. But even if they had, an interest in increasing turnout for particular groups is akin to a \n“generalized partisan preference[],” which the Supreme Court held insufficient to establish Article III \nstanding. Gill v. Whitford, 138 S. Ct. 1916, 1933 (2018). Rather, “[a]n organization’s general interest in \nits  preferred  candidates  winning  as  many  elections  as  possible  is  still  a  ‘generalized  partisan \npreference[]’ that federal courts are ‘not responsible for vindicating.’” Jacobson v. Fla. Sec’y of State, 957 \n                                            \n5 See also, e.g., Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Envtl. Servs., 528 U.S. at 191 (recognizing that, unlike mootness, “[s]tanding \nadmits of no similar exception; if a plaintiff lacks standing at the time the action commences, the fact that the dispute is \ncapable of repetition yet evading review will not entitle the complainant to a federal judicial forum.”). \n6 Defendants do not concede that Intervenors have established redressability and reserve all rights to test Intervenors’ \nevidence regarding this factor. \n8 \n \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 78   Filed 06/12/20   Page 9 of 22\n \nF.3d 1193, 1206 (11th Cir. 2020) (quoting Gill, 138 S. Ct. at 1933). Thus, Intervenors’ allegation about \nimpact on the “electoral prospects” of unspecified candidates would not establish Article III injury, \neven if there were any evidence to support it. \nSecond, Intervenors allege injury based upon resources they expend to register voters who \nIntervenors predict will vote for Democrats. Dkt. 77 at 13-14.7 “[A]n organization may establish injury \nin fact by showing that it had diverted significant resources to counteract the defendant’s conduct; \nhence, the defendant’s conduct significantly and ‘perceptibly impaired’ the organization’s ability to” \nconduct its routine “‘activities—with the consequent drain on the organization’s resources [that] \nconstitutes far more than simply a setback to the organization’s abstract social interests.’” City of Kyle, \n626 F.3d at 238 (quoting Havens Realty Corp. v. Coleman, 455 U.S. 363, 379 (1982)). To constitute injury-\nin-fact, an organization’s “diversion of resources” must be directed “to counteract [a] defendant’s \nconduct,” id. at 238, and must be “diverted” to activities that are in some way “different from the \nplaintiffs’ daily operations,” OCA-Greater Hous. v. Texas, 867 F.3d 604, 612 (5th Cir. 2017) (citing City \nof Kyle, 626 F.3d 233). Mere “[f]rustration of an organization’s objectives is the type of abstract concern \nthat does not impart standing.” Ctr. for Law & Educ. v. Dep’t of Educ., 396 F.3d 1152, 1161-62 (D.C. \nCir. 2005) (quotation omitted). Organizations cannot assert “standing based solely on the baseline \nwork they are already doing,” and cannot “convert ordinary program costs into an injury in fact.” \nCommon Cause Indiana v. Lawson, 937 F.3d 944, 955 (7th Cir. 2019) (punctuation marks omitted). \nThus, to establish organizational standing, the organization must show an explicit connection \nbetween a defendant’s challenged conduct and its alleged injury. The Fifth Circuit has made clear that \nin the voting context, if an organization’s regular activities merely have some connection to the alleged \nharm, this is insufficient; rather, the organization’s activities must be specifically directed at addressing \n                                            \n7 See also TDP Dep. 22:1-13; DCCC Dep. 6:19-24, 42:16-43:2; DSCC Dep. 21:6-14. \n9 \n \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 78   Filed 06/12/20   Page 10 of 22\n \nthe alleged wrong and reaching the allegedly affected voters. See ACORN v. Fowler, 178 F.3d 350, 359 \n(5th Cir. 1999); see also Dkt. 73 at 6-7 (discussing Fowler). In other words, an organization’s expenditures \nmust be “caused by an[] action by” the defendant that the organization “claims is illegal, as opposed \nto part of the normal, day-to-day operations of the group,” to confer standing. See Fowler, 178 F.3d at \n358 (citing Fair Hous. Council of Suburban Philadelphia v. Montgomery Newspapers, 141 F.3d 71, 78 & n.5 \n(3d Cir. 1998)). Moreover, a plaintiff “cannot manufacture standing by choosing to make expenditures \nbased on” an alleged harm that is not itself an injury-in-fact. Clapper v. Amnesty Intern. USA, 568 U.S. \n398, 402 (2013). A diversion of resources is not a cognizable injury in fact unless the plaintiff “would \nhave suffered some other injury if it had not diverted resources to counteracting the problem.” La \nAsociacion de Trabajadores de Lake Forest v. City of Lake Forest, 624 F.3d 1083, 1088 (9th Cir. 2010). \nIntervenors cannot meet this standard. Instead, the evidence shows that Intervenors dedicate \nresources to identifying and registering people likely to support Democrats when they believe that \ndoing so will help elect Democrats to office—and that they would engage in the exact same activities \nregardless of how Defendants handle online driver license transactions.8 \nIntervenors simply target Democratic voters, with no knowledge of whether they have \ntransacted with DPS online.9 There is no competent evidence that they have undertaken any activity \nspecifically because of the Defendants’ challenged conduct. They have not proven that they have had \nto forgo any specific activities because of the challenged conduct, and they have not proven they \nwould act any differently at all if they were successful in this litigation. Thus, to the extent that the \nIntervenors  engage  in  voter-registration  activities,  those  activities  are  wholly  untethered  to \nDefendants’ allegedly unlawful practices. Intervenors have therefore failed to show that they “diverted \nsignificant resources to counteract the [Defendants’] conduct” such that “the [Defendants’] conduct \n                                            \n8 See, e.g., TDP Dep. 22:2-13; DCCC Dep.14:2-8; DSCC Dep. 41:8-12. \n9 TDP Dep. 101:18-22; 108:21-109:6; DCCC Dep. 89:4-16, 98:2-8, 101:17-21; DSCC Dep. 39:13-21, 30:2-13, Ex. 5. \n10 \n \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 78   Filed 06/12/20   Page 11 of 22\n \nsignificantly and ‘perceptibly impaired’ the organization’s ability to” engage in its “routine activities,” \nas required to show organizational standing. City of Kyle, 626 F.3d at 238. Quite the contrary—voter \nregistration targeted to help Democratic candidates is already central to these organizations’ “routine \nactivities.”10 Intervenors have not suffered any “concrete and demonstrable” injury. Havens Realty Corp. \nv. Coleman, 455 U.S. at 379; City of Kyle, 626 F.3d at 238.  \nMoreover, to the extent that the record reflects that Intervenors expended any specific \nresources on voter registration in Texas, there is no evidence that they did so until after joining this \nlawsuit.11 The fact that the sole activities Intervenors rely upon to support their standing post-date their \ninvolvement in this lawsuit provides an additional and independent basis why they lack standing. See, \ne.g., Pluet v. Frasier, 355 F.3d at 386; Soc’y of Separationists, Inc. v. Herman, 959 F.2d at 1288. \nii.  Causation \nIntervenors also lack standing because they cannot establish causation as to either of their \nalleged injuries. Whether or not a voter completes the steps Texas law sets out to register to vote or \nupdate an existing registration depends on that voter. Thus, even if Intervenors presented evidence of \nan impact on their electoral prospects or a diversion of resources away from their routine activities \n(they have not), Defendants’ conduct cannot have been the cause. Rather, any such outcome is the \nresult of independent action by individual Texas voters, and does not satisfy the causation element \nnecessary to establish Article III standing. See Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560 (for an injury-in-fact to be fairly \ntraceable to the challenged action of the defendant, “there must be a causal connection between the \ninjury and the conduct complained of.”); Westfall v. Miller, 77 F.3d 868, 871-73 (5th Cir. 1996) (injury \nstemming from plaintiff’s own inaction severs causal link between that injury and any conduct of \n                                            \n10 TDP Dep. 22:2-13; DCCC Dep.14:2-8; DSCC Dep. 41:8-12. \n11 See, e.g,, DSCC Dep. Ex. 5 (reflecting that DSCC’s first transfer to TDP took place on January 10, 2020); DCCC Dep. \nEx. 3 (affidavit filed January 28, 2020,  referring to a “recent” contract to pay a consultant for voter-outreach activities in \nCongressional District 23); TDP Dep. Ex. 2 at TDP_000063 (January 15, 2020 email noting future plans to launch a voter-\nregistration program.). \n11 \n \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 78   Filed 06/12/20   Page 12 of 22\n \ndefendant). This Court should “decline to abandon [the] usual reluctance to endorse standing theories \nthat rest on speculation about the decisions of independent actors,” and should conclude that \nIntervenors lack standing. Clapper v. Amnesty Int’l USA, 568 U.S. at 414. \nMoreover, Intervenors concede that it is impossible for them to trace what resources were \nexpended on voting efforts.12 Thus, it strains credulity to assert that—even if this amounts to injury—\nit can be “fairly traced” to anything in particular, much less Texas law. See, e.g., id. at 413-14 (discussing \ntraceability requirement for causation). \nC.  Intervenors Lack Associational Standing. \n \nIntervenors’ assertion of associational standing, Dkt. 77 at 19-21, also fails. An association has \nstanding to sue on its members’ behalf when: (1) its members would have standing to sue in their own \nright; (2) the interests it seeks to protect are germane to the organization’s purpose; and (3) neither \nthe claim asserted nor the relief requested requires the participation of individual members. Texans \nUnited for a Safe Econ. Educ. Fund v. Crown Cent. Petroleum Case Corp., 207 F.3d 789, 792 (5th Cir. 2000) \n(citing Hunt v. Washington St. Apple Advert. Comm’n, 432 U.S. 333, 343 (1977); Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. \nChevron Chem. Co., 129 F.3d 826, 827–28 (5th Cir. 1997)). Intervenors argue that they have standing to \nsue “on behalf of Democratic Texas voters (their members and constituents) who are not able to \nregister to vote when they update their addresses or renew their licenses with DPS,” including \nindividual plaintiff “John Harms, who voted in the March [2020] Democratic primary.” Dkt. 77 at 20. \nThis does not meet Intervenors’ burden to show associational standing for at least three reasons. \nFirst, there is no evidence that any Intervenor has members within the meaning of the \nassociational standing test. See Hunt v. Wash. State Apple Advert. Comm’n, 432 U.S. at 344 (requiring \n“indicia of membership”). To meet this standard, an organization must have members who “elect \n                                            \n12 TDP Dep. 45:14-21, 101:1-4; DCCC Dep. 84:8-10, 85:22-86:23; DSCC Dep. 30:2-13. \n12 \n \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 78   Filed 06/12/20   Page 13 of 22\n \nleadership, serve as the organization’s leadership, and finance the organization’s activities, including \nthe case’s litigation costs.” Tex. Indigenous Council v. Simpkins, No. 5:11-cv-315, 2014 WL 252024, at *3 \n(W.D. Tex. Jan. 22, 2014); see also Hunt, 432 U.S. at 344-45 (describing indicia of membership). \nIntervenors’  own  summary  judgment  evidence  shows  only  that  TDP  regards  “approximately \n2,084,000 Texans who voted in the March 3rd Democratic primary” as its members; that DSCC’s \nmembers are the Democrats elected to Congress; and that DCCC does not regard Democratic voters \nas their members. Dkt. 77 at 19 (citing Dkt. 77-1 at Appx. 466, 594, 672). This falls far short of \ndemonstrating the “indicia of membership” required for an association to establish standing as such. \nCf. Ass’n for Retarded Citizens of Dall. v. Dall. Cnty. Mental Health & Mental Retardation Ctr. Bd. of Trustees, \n19 F.3d 241, 244 (5th Cir. 1994) (finding that an organization is not a “membership” group eligible to \nassert  associational  standing  under  Hunt  unless  its  members  “participate  in  and  guide  the \norganization’s efforts.”) \nSecond,  even  if  any  Intervenor  were  a  “membership”  organization  for  purposes  of \nassociational standing, they still must identify at least one specific member of the organization with \nstanding in their own right. See City of Kyle, 626 F.3d at 238-39. The only individual voter Intervenors \neven mention is John Harms, who testified that he voted in the 2020 Democratic primary. Dkt. 77 at \n20 (citing Dkt. 77-1, Interv. MSJ App.466). As Defendants have already briefed, Mr. Harms himself \nlacks standing to maintain his claims in this case. See Dkt. 60 at 7-8. But even if Mr. Harms did have \nstanding, no Intervenor could ride his coattails to Article III jurisdiction. Indeed, Texas is an open-\nprimary state, meaning that any eligible voter may participate in the primary election of either major \nparty. Intervenors offer no evidence that Mr. Harms is, in fact, a member of TDP, DSCC, or DCCC—\nor even that he is a Democrat. Mr. Harms has not alleged as much, either. See Dkt. 1. And Intervenors \ncertainly make no effort to demonstrate that Mr. Harms is a member within the meaning of Hunt—\n13 \n \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 78   Filed 06/12/20   Page 14 of 22\n \nthere is no evidence he participates in electing the organization’s members, serving in the organization, \nand financing its activities. Cf. Hunt, 432 U.S. at 344-45. \nThird, even under Intervenors’ expansive definition of a membership organization, there is no \nevidence  that  any  of  their  purported  “members”  has  standing  to  sue.  This  requires  evidence \n“establishing that at least one identified member had suffered or would suffer harm.” Summers v. Earth \nIsland Inst., 555 U.S. 488, 498 (2009) (citations omitted); see also Funeral Consumers All. v. Serv. Corp. Int’l, \n695 F.3d 330, 344 (5th Cir. 2012). The Fifth Circuit has carefully and particularly described the \nstanding burden that a plaintiff must carry in this litigation. See Stringer v. Whitley, 942 F.3d 715 (5th \nCir. 2019). Intervenors have not even attempted to do so. Thus, they lack associational standing. \nII.  Collateral Estoppel is Inapposite. \n \nIntervenors assert that “Defendants are precluded from relitigating the equal protection claim \nunder the doctrine of collateral estoppel, which promotes judicial economy by preventing ‘needless \nlitigation,’” Dkt. 77 at 22 (citation omitted).  In support, they rely solely upon Stringer I—a case that \ndid not involve them—asserting in essence that Defendants are not entitled to mount a defense to \nIntervenor’s lawsuit. Dkt. 77 at 22-24. They also ignore that Stringer I did not involve any organizational \nplaintiffs at all, but solely dealt with individual rights under the NVRA. Far from being “needless,” \nthis  is  Defendants’  first  opportunity  to  test  Intervenors’  claim  and  theories—including  their \nboundless, overreaching, and erroneous conceptions of standing and equal protection. The notion \nthat collateral estoppel would apply to Intervenors’ claim defies common sense. \nIntervenors’  legal  analysis  of  collateral  estoppel  (or  “issue  preclusion”)  also  egregiously \nmisstates this foundational doctrine. Id. Intervenors first cite Winters v. Diamond Shamrock Chem. Co., \n149 F.3d 387, 396 (5th Cir. 1998), which held that a litigant was not entitled to use collateral estoppel \noffensively to bar relitigation of an issue in the removal context. This has nothing to do with the facts \nhere.  Second, they cite Langley v. Price, 926  F.3d 145  (5th Cir. 2019), which  noted the  rather \n14 \n \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 78   Filed 06/12/20   Page 15 of 22\n \nunremarkable proposition that, “[w]hen a judgment is partially reversed on appeal, ‘[t]here is no \npreclusion as to the matters vacated or reversed.” Dkt. 77 at 18 (quoting Langley, 926 F.3d at 167).  \nIndeed. “[A] civil judgment generates issue preclusion only when it’s ‘valid and final.’” Langley, \n926 F.3d at 164 (quoting Restatement (Second) of Judgments § 27 (Am. Law Inst. 1982)). “[O]nce a \ncivil judgment is reversed on appeal, it’s obviously no longer ‘valid’ and retains zero preclusive effect.” \nId. The Fifth Circuit reversed and vacated the judgment in Stringer I in its entirety because the plaintiffs \nwho brought that case lacked standing; no part of that order survived. See Stringer v. Whitley (Stringer I), \n942 F.3d 715 (5th Cir. 2019). Accordingly, that prior judgment “retains zero preclusive effect.” Langley, \n926 F.3d at 164. Collateral estoppel has nothing to do with this case.  \nIII.  Defendants are Entitled to Summary Judgment Dismissing Intervenors’ Claim. \n \nIntervenors’ merits argument on summary judgment, remarkably, relies solely upon citations \nto Stringer I and a smattering of cursory references to Anderson-Burdick. Dkt. 77 at 18-20. This will not \ndo. See, e.g., Lawrence v. Fed. Home Loan Mortg. Corp., 808 F.3d at 673 (to meet summary judgment \nburden, plaintiff cannot rely on unsupported or conclusory assertions, speculation, or subjective belief \nbut must instead put forward specific facts). Instead, the evidence shows that Intervenors suffer no \nequal protection violation. Thus, if the Court determines that it has jurisdiction over Intervenors’ claim \nat all, it should enter summary judgment dismissing that claim because Intervenors have not even \nstated—let alone proven—a violation of the Equal Protection Clause. \nA. Intervenors Have Not Stated a Violation of the Equal Protection Clause. \n \nTo maintain an equal protection claim, a political party must allege “intentional discrimination \nagainst an identifiable political group and an actual discriminatory effect on that group.” Republican \nParty of N.C. v. Martin, 980 F.2d 943, 955 (4th Cir. 1992) (citation omitted); see also, e.g., Veasey v. Abbott, \n830 F.3d 216, 230 (5th Cir. 2016) (en banc) (stating that “[p]roof of racially discriminatory intent or \npurpose is required to show a violation of the Equal Protection Clause”) (quoting Village of Arlington \n15 \n \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 78   Filed 06/12/20   Page 16 of 22\n \nHeights v. Metro. Hous. Dev. Corp., 429 U.S. 252, 265 (1977)). Intervenors do not even allege purposeful \ndiscrimination in which any class—let alone a political one—is favored over another.  \nStatutes providing neutral rules, which might benefit any political party, are not rendered \ndiscriminatory by the fact that they benefit one party when applied in particular circumstances. See \nRodriguez v. Popular Democratic Party, 457 U.S. 1, 10 n.10 (1982) (holding that “a statute providing that \nall such vacancies [in the legislature] be filled by appointment does not have a special impact on any \ndiscrete group of voters or candidates” and thus is not discriminatory for equal-protection purposes). \nIntervenors offer no argument that Defendants’ handling of online transactions disproportionately \nimpacts them. And they certainly do not allege that it is the result of “intentional discrimination” \nagainst Democrats. Cf. Republican Party of N.C. v. Martin, 980 F.2d at 955. \nBecause Intervenors have not even met this threshold pleading standard, Defendants re-urge \nand incorporate by reference their argument that this claim should be dismissed on its face without \nreference to the record. See, e.g., Dkt. 56. But the record readily confirms this result. \nB.  Intervenors Have Not Proven an Equal Protection Violation. \n \ni.  The Legal Standard \n \n“[T]he Constitution of the United States protects the right of all qualified citizens to vote, in \nstate as well as in federal elections.” Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U.S. 533, 554 (1964). “It does not follow, \nhowever, that the right to vote in any manner . . . [is] absolute.” Burdick v. Takushi, 504 U.S. 428, 433 \n(1992). To that end, Anderson-Burdick’s “flexible standard” generally governs First and Fourteenth \nAmendment challenges predicated on voting rights. Burdick, 504 U.S. at 434; see also Anderson v. \nCelebrezze, 460 U.S. 780 (1983). Under that standard, courts “weigh the character and magnitude of \nthe asserted injury to the rights protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments against the precise \ninterests put forward by the State as justifications for the burden imposed by its rule.” Tex. Indep. Party \nv. Kirk, 84 F.3d 178, 182 (5th Cir. 1996) (citing Burdick, 504 U.S. at 434; Anderson, 460 U.S. at 789). \n16 \n \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 78   Filed 06/12/20   Page 17 of 22\n \n“The rigorousness of the inquiry into the propriety of the state election law depends upon the \nextent to which the challenged regulation burdens First and Fourteenth Amendment rights.” Id. (citing \nBurdick, 504 U.S. at 434). Strict scrutiny applies only when the right to vote is “subjected to ‘severe’ \nrestrictions.” Burdick, 504 U.S. at 434. Where a law “imposes only reasonable, nondiscriminatory \nrestrictions upon the First and Fourteenth Amendment rights of voters, the State’s important \nregulatory interests are generally sufficient to justify the restrictions.” Id.; see also Anderson, 460 U.S. at \n788. Courts consider a state’s election regime in its entirety, including aspects which mitigate the \nburdens of any challenged provision. See, e.g., Crawford v. Marion Cty. Election Bd., 553 U.S. 181, 199 \n(2008); Ohio Democratic Party v. Husted, 834 F.3d 620, 627-28 (6th Cir. 2016) (noting that numerous \nopportunities available to cast a ballot mitigate burden of early voting requirements).  \nLast week, the Fifth Circuit addressed the standard for voting-related equal protection claims: \nunless plaintiffs “‘are in fact absolutely prohibited from voting by the State,’” it held, “the right to vote \nis not ‘at stake,’ and rational-basis review follows.” Texas Democratic Party v. Abbott, No. 20-50407, 2020 \nWL 2982937, at *10 (5th Cir. June 4, 2020) (applying rational basis review to statute allowing voters \n65 or older to vote by mail without extending that opportunity to voters under 65) (quoting McDonald \nv. Bd. of Election Comm’rs of Chi., 394 U.S. 802, 808 n.7, 807, 807–11 (1969)).13 Accordingly, under the \nflexible standard that applies to Intervenors’ claim, as stated by the Fifth Circuit, Defendants need \nonly pass a rational basis review. But even if a higher standard applies, Intervenors’ claim still fails. \nii.  Texas’s written signature requirement survives rational basis review. \n \nBecause “the right to vote is not ‘at stake,’” rational basis review applies. Texas Democratic Party \nv. Abbott, 2020 WL 2982937, at *10. Under this standard, “statutory classifications will be set aside \nonly if no grounds can be conceived to justify them,” and “[t]he law need only ‘bear some rational \n                                            \n13 See also, e.g., Biener v. Calio, 361 F.3d 206, 214 (3d Cir. 2004) (ballot access restriction); Michigan State A. Philip Randolph \nInst. v. Johnson, 749 F. App’x 342, 350 (6th Cir. 2018) (straight-ticket voting). \n17 \n \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 78   Filed 06/12/20   Page 18 of 22\n \nrelationship to a legitimate state end.’” Id. (citations omitted). In other words, “a court must uphold \nthe law if there is any conceivable basis for it.” Id. (citing Box v. Planned Parenthood of Ind. & Ky., Inc., 139 \nS. Ct. 1780, 1782 (2019) (per curiam)). It cannot be debated that States have an interest in requiring a \nsignature from voters—the NVRA itself recognizes that voter-registration applications must be signed \nunder penalty of perjury. 52 U.S.C. § 20504(c). This provides ample justification for Texas’s statutory \nrequirement that “[a] registration application must be in writing and signed by the applicant.” TEX. \nELEC. CODE § 13.002(b). \niii.  Even  under  a  more  stringent  standard,  Texas’s  written  signature \nrequirement does not violate the Equal Protection Clause. \n \nUnder Anderson-Burdick, we turn first to the “character and magnitude of the asserted injury \nto the rights protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments” at issue. Intervenors assert (by \nreference to the plaintiffs’ filings in Stringer I) that Texans who choose online transactions are \nburdened because—unlike those who choose to visit DPS in person or mail a voter-registration \napplication to their county—online users cannot simply check a box to become registered to vote \nor change their registration address. Instead, individuals who engage in an online transaction must \nprint out a voter-registration form, fill it out, sign it, and mail it, which satisfies Texas’s written-\nsignature requirement. But neither Intervenors nor the Plaintiffs whose arguments they rely upon \nexplain how being treated like everyone else—supplying a written signature in order to register or \nupdate an existing registration—is a burden on their equal-protection rights. If a Texan desires the \nsimplicity of checking a single box, she may fill out a paper registration form. Put differently, \nproviding multiple options for individuals to register to vote is not a violation of the Equal Protection \nClause even if Intervenors consider some options more convenient than others. \nThe precise interest of the State in requiring written signatures, which necessarily forecloses \nonline voter registration in a new county, is in maintaining accurate voting rolls and combatting \n18 \n \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 78   Filed 06/12/20   Page 19 of 22\n \nfraud. And Texas can use the written signatures in cases of fraud, identity theft, consideration of \nabsentee ballots, and when there are problems with electronically captured signatures. See, e.g., Stringer \nI, Dkt. 77-1 at 82; 80-1 at 61, 71-72; see also Husted v. A. Philip Randolph Inst., 138 S. Ct. 1833, 1838 \n(2018) (“It has been estimated that 24 million voter registrations in the United States—about one in \neight—are either invalid or significantly inaccurate. Pew Center on the States, Election Initiatives \nIssue Brief (Feb. 2012).”). \nThis Fifth Circuit has also recognized that preventing voter-registration fraud is a permissible \nstate interest that warrants some limits on voter registration. Voting for Am., 732 F.3d at 394-95. It is \nnot necessary for Defendants to produce specific evidence of fraud to justify preventative measures. \nId. (citing Crawford v. Marion Cty. Election Bd., 553 U.S. at 196 (plurality op.)); see Short v. Brown, 893 \nF.3d 671, 679 (9th Cir. 2018) (finding “general interest in increasing voter turnout” sufficient to \njustify experimental use of mail-in ballots in specific counties); Tripp v. Scholz, 872 F.3d 857, 866 (7th \nCir. 2017) (finding “speculative concern” sufficient to justify ballot-access limitation); Ohio Democratic \nParty v. Husted, 834 F.3d at 632 (holding that when a regulation is “not unduly burdensome,” a State \ndoes not have to “prove” that evidence supports its interest; the court may defer to the legislature’s \nfindings); Munro v. Socialist Workers Party, 479 U.S. 189, 195 (1986) (“Legislatures . . . should be \npermitted to respond to potential deficiencies in the electoral process with foresight rather than \nreactively . . . .”). A State may act to prevent potential fraud, as “[a]ny corruption in voter registration \naffects a state’s paramount obligation to ensure the integrity of the voting process and threatens the \npublic’s right to democratic government.” Voting for Am., 732 F.3d at 394. “There should be ‘no \nquestion about the legitimacy or importance of the State’s interest in counting only the votes of \neligible voters.’” Tex. Democratic Party v. Abbott, 2020 WL 2982937, at *18 (Ho, J., concurring) (quoting \nCrawford, 553 U.S. at 196). \n19 \n \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 78   Filed 06/12/20   Page 20 of 22\n \nAs noted above, Intervenors have no equal protection right at stake here. But even if they \ncould assert one, the State’s interest would outweigh it. Texas provides multiple options to register \nto vote, some of which particular Texans might find more or less convenient, but all of which satisfy \nthe State’s written-signature requirement to register in a new county. Determining whether to permit \nonline voter registration is a quintessentially state-law function, absent a preemptive federal law \nrequiring it. U.S. CONST. art. I, § 4, cl. 1. Congress and the Texas Legislature have considered \nmandating online voter registration but, to date, neither legislative body has required it. See, e.g., Voter \nEmpowerment Act of 2015, H.R. 12, 114th Cong. (2015); Voter Empowerment Act of 2012, H.R. \n5799/S. 3608, 112th Cong. (2012); Tex. H.B. 953, 84th Leg., R.S., (2015); Tex. S.B. 385, 84th Leg., \nR.S. (2015). The Equal Protection Clause does not require online voter registration either. \nNo  person’s  right  to  vote  is  unconstitutionally burdened  by  Texas’s  written-signature \nrequirement for voter registration. Consequently, Intervenors are not entitled to what they demand. \niv.  Intervenors request unworkable relief. \nDefendants re-urge that injunctive relief is not warranted here, but without conceding this \noption, note that any injunctive relief must, at the very least, minimize additional programming \nrequirements and be consistent with the existing strictures of the DPS and SOS systems. Intervenors’ \nproposed order is not. DPS’s current in-office renewal or change-of-address form, the DL-14A, asks \nthe applicant “If you are a U.S. citizen, would you like to register to vote? If registered, would you like \nto update your voter information?” Exhibit D. By contrast, Intervenors ask the Court to order DPS \nto ask customers who renew or change their address online—not simply the question on the DL-\n14A—but different questions. In particular, Intervenors’ proposed order would require registered voters \nto “opt out” of updating their voter registration address. Dkt, 77-1, Interv. MSJ Appx. 774. By \ncontrast, customers interacting with DPS in person are asked, “If you are a U.S. citizen, would you \nlike to register to vote? If registered, would you like to update your voter information?” Exhibit D. \n20 \n \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 78   Filed 06/12/20   Page 21 of 22\n \nRequiring registered voters to “opt-out” rather than answer “yes” or “no” makes Intervenors’ \nproposed new online process different from the in-office process they argue it must match. This would \nrequire additional programming, testing, and implementation time, none of which was explored or \ncontemplated by any of the parties during discovery. Moreover, Intervenors offer no basis to conclude \nthat this proposed opt-out process is required by the Equal Protection Clause. \nCONCLUSION \n  This Court should dismiss Intervenors from this case with prejudice. \n \nRespectfully submitted. \n \nKEN PAXTON \nAttorney General of Texas \n \nJEFFREY C.

They respectfully ask the Court to render final summary judgment against \nDefendants and order the State of Texas to take immediate steps to adhere to the Constitution \nand federal law.  \nPRELIMINARY STATEMENT \nThe central fact of this case has never been disputed: When eligible Texans update their \ndriver’s licenses online with the Department of Public Safety (DPS), they are not offered a \nsimultaneous application to register to vote or update their voter registration information.1 As \nthis Court has already held, the NVRA requires that each driver’s license application, including \nany renewal application, simultaneously serve as an application for voter registration, and that \neach change-of-address form be used to update the voter’s registration records. \nTexas’s refusal to integrate voter registration into its online driver’s license renewal and \nchange-of-address process affects nearly 1.5 million Texans annually, including the Plaintiffs \nhere. Each Plaintiff moved within Texas, changed his driver’s license address using DPS’s \nonline driver license renewal and change-of-address website, indicated “Yes” in response to the \nprompt “I want to register to vote,” but was not registered to vote. Each Plaintiff, although \neligible  to  do  so,  was  prevented  from  fully  exercising  his  fundamental  right  to  vote  in  a \nsubsequent election due to his outdated registration record.  \n                                                 \n1 As Defendants put it, “[t]he key facts of this case are not disputed.” Defs.’ Reply in Supp. of \nMot. to Dismiss, Dkt. 12 at 6; see also Joint Report on Alternative Dispute Resolution, Dkt. 22 at \n2 (stating that the parties agree “that their primary dispute is legal, rather than factual”). \n1 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 77   Filed 06/30/17   Page 7 of 32\n \nTexas  has  known  for  years  that  its  online  driver’s  license  transaction  practices \ndisenfranchise  large  numbers  of  voters.  Between  September  2013  and  February  2015,  for \ninstance, more than 1,800 Texans complained about Texas’ failure to register individuals to vote \nthrough the DPS online driver's license application, according to the State’s own records. Yet \nTexas  took  no  meaningful  steps  to  fix  its  process.  Instead,  adding  insult  to  injury,  DPS \nencourages the use of the online system over in-person transactions, resulting—predictably—in \na dramatic uptick in online transactions and, by extension, injured prospective voters. \nThe State does not claim that NVRA compliance would be too expensive or burdensome. \nInstead, Texas seeks to contort the plain language of the law to justify its current processes. \nAccording to the Defendants, even though the NVRA provides “simultaneous application for \nvoter registration” by requiring that “each . . . driver’s license application . . .  serve as an \napplication for voter registration,” 52 U.S.C. § 20504, what it means is something else entirely. \nThe State asserts that it must offer nothing more than a simultaneous opportunity to register to \nvote during an online driver’s license transaction, which can be satisfied by forcing online DPS \ncustomers  to  retrieve,  print,  complete,  and  mail  an  entirely  separate  and  duplicative  voter \nregistration application after finishing their online transaction. This Court rightfully rejected that \nreading of the NVRA, holding that the law clearly prohibits Texas’s procedure because the \nNVRA requires not only “that the applications be simultaneous, but discusses them in terms of a \nsingle transaction.”2 Accordingly, and as this Court found, Texas’s refusal to treat online driver’s \nlicense  renewal  and  change-of-address  forms  as  voter  registration  applications  violates  the \nNVRA.  \nNo doubt recognizing the weakness of its “simultaneous opportunity” argument, the State \nmakes another, even bolder argument—that the NVRA gives states the prerogative to legislate \n                                                 \n2 Order, Dkt. 52 at 11 (citing 52 U.S.C. §§ 20504(a)(1), 20504(c)(1), 20504(d)).  \n2 \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 77   Filed 06/30/17   Page 8 of 32\n \naway the law’s mandates if a state determines that the NVRA conflicts with state law. Since \nTexas law requires a voter’s signature on a voter registration form, Defendants claim that the \nNVRA permits Texas to flout the statute’s simultaneous-application requirement and require \nDPS customers to fill out and sign an entirely separate voter registration form after providing \nidentical information to DPS during an NVRA-covered transaction. The NVRA, of course, \npermits no such thing. As a federal law, long upheld against constitutional challenge, it preempts \nany conflicting state requirements. Voting Rights Coal. v. Wilson, 60 F.3d 1411, 1415–16 (9th \nCir. 1995); Ass'n of Cmty. Organizations for Reform Now (ACORN) v. Edgar, 56 F.3d 791, 794-\n795 (7th Cir. 1995).3 Moreover, as this Court noted, this argument is a red herring: In fact, \nanyone using DPS’s online driver license renewal and change-of-address system has already \nprovided the state with his signature, which Texas already uses to update their voter registration \nfiles in some circumstances.4  \n“The  right  to  vote  freely  for  the  candidate  of  one’s  choice  is  of  the  essence  of  a \ndemocratic  society,  and  any  restrictions  on  that  right  strike  at  the  heart  of  representative \ngovernment.” Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U.S. 533, 555 (1964). Too many Texas voters have been \nunlawfully denied voter registration, just like the Plaintiffs, because of the State’s longstanding \nfailure to comply with the NVRA.  Another federal election cycle is fast approaching; the \ndeadline to register to vote for the March primary election is a little more than seven months \naway.5 Given that the fundamental right to vote is at stake for millions of Texas voters, the Court \nshould order immediate compliance with the NVRA and the Constitution. The State should be \n                                                 \n3 See also Dkt. 52 at 14-16. \n4 Id. at 16-18. \n5 The deadline for the March 2018 primaries is February 5, 2018.

Defendants, \non the other hand, purposely delayed responding to Plaintiffs’ discovery requests for months \nafter  the  documents  were  due,  requiring  Plaintiffs  to  obtain  a  Court  Order  compelling \nDefendants’  responses—an  Order  Defendants  were  ultimately  sanctioned  for  intentionally \nviolating.  Since  their  initial  pre-litigation  communications  in  May  2015,  Plaintiffs  have \ncontinued to emphasize the need to resolve this matter as soon as possible, well before the 2018 \nelection, but Defendants have repeatedly, purposefully delayed.  \nUNDISPUTED FACTS \n  DPS  operates  offices  around  the  state  and  issues  driver’s  licenses  and  other  state \nidentification cards.

A DPS customer who decides to or is required to transact with DPS in person must \nfill out the relevant driver’s license form with personal information in order to obtain, update, or \nrenew his driver’s license.13 DPS uses different forms depending on the type of transaction: form \nDL-14A  for  an  original  (in-person)  Application  for  Texas  Driver  License  or  Identification \n                                                 \n8 Appx. 31 (Ex. 4, Texas Department of Public Safety Implementation Plan, D_00021063 at \nD_00021065); \n9 Appx. 33 (Ex. 5, Excerpt, Texas Secretary of State Elections Division 34th Annual Election \nLaw Seminar, “DPS Voter Inquiry Web Portal” 669, D_00014211 at slide 3).  \n10 52 U.S.C. § 20509, Tex.

Jarrod Stringer \nPlaintiff Jarrod Stringer moved from Tarrant County to  Bexar County in August of \n2014.39 Prior to his move, Mr. Stringer was registered to vote in Tarrant County.40 After moving, \nMr. Stringer updated his driver’s license address online, checking “yes” to the voter registration \nquestion  and  intending  to  update  his  voter  registration.41  Thereafter,  he  believed  his  voter \nregistration records were updated.42 Mr. Stringer attempted to vote early in the 2014 general \nelection, but was told that he was not registered.43 Mr. Stringer then called Bexar County election \nofficials and was told that he was not registered in Bexar County and could only vote a limited \nballot with statewide candidates.44 When Mr. Stringer explained that he had changed his address \nthrough DPS’s website, the election officials with whom he spoke told Mr. Stringer that the \ncounty was aware of “problems through DPS.”45  \n3.  John Woods \nPlaintiff Dr. John O. Woods III changed his residence from Travis County to Harris \nCounty in June 2015.46 Prior to this move, Dr. Woods was registered to vote in Travis County.47 \n                                                 \n37 Appx. 161 and 158-159 (Id. at 37:8-13, 32:23-33:19). \n38 Appx. 159-160 (Id. at 33:20-34:11); Defs.’ Dkt. 57 at ¶ 46.

DPS is technologically capable of collecting and transmitting voter-registration \ninformation from online transactions to SOS and doing so would not be cost \nprohibitive. \n \nThe change Plaintiffs request—requiring DPS to record and transfer the registration \ninformation it already collects and confirms during online driver’s license renewal or change-of-\naddress to the SOS, along with the customer’s previously-obtained electronic signature, and \nrequiring SOS to transfer the voter registration information to local voter registrars—is possible \nand would not be overly burdensome.55 Director of Elections Keith Ingram, SOS’s 30(b)(6) \ndesignee, essentially drilling down to Defendants’ core defense, testified, “This is a very possible \n                                                                                                                                                             \n47 Appx. 197 (Ex. 23, Woods Dep. 34:06-25). \n48 Appx. 195-196 (Id. 25:16-26:2). \n49 Appx. 194-196 (Id. 22:03-13; 25:22-26:5); Appx. 103 (Ex. 13, SOS’s Suppl.

Moreover, implementing Plaintiffs’ request would be \neven easier than the current process for in-person and mail-in change-of-address transactions \nbecause DPS customers would be entering their data into the system instead of DPS customer \nservice representatives \nNor  do  Defendants  claim  that  the  cost  of  Plaintiffs’  requested  remedy  would  be \nprohibitive. Mr. Ingram opined that it would not cost a lot of money for DPS to send the \npreviously obtained electronic signature to SOS, and further estimated that the cost of a fully \nonline voter registration program, which goes beyond what Plaintiffs seek, would be $182,000.57  \nLEGAL STANDARD \n  Summary judgment is warranted if “the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as \nto any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.”58 A dispute as to \na material fact is genuine if the evidence is sufficient to permit a reasonable factfinder to return a \nverdict for the nonmoving party. Crowe v. Henry, 115 F.3d 294, 296 (5th Cir. 1997). A fact is \nmaterial  if its resolution  could  affect  the outcome of the action under  governing law, and \n“[f]actual disputes that are irrelevant or unnecessary will not be counted.” Anderson v. Liberty \nLobby, Inc., 447 U.S. 242, 248 (1986). Summary judgment is proper, then, if under governing \nlaw there is only one reasonable conclusion as to the verdict. Id. at 249. \nARGUMENT \nThe right to vote is fundamental, and Texas’s violations injured and will continue to \ninjure Plaintiffs and many more eligible Texas voters. Arcia v. Florida Sec’y of State, 772 F.3d \n                                                 \n56 Appx. 46 (Ex. 6, Ingram 30(b)(6) Dep. 186:5-13).  \n57 Appx. 45-46 (Id.184:12-185:5, 186:21-187:24). \n58 Fed.

Wesley Educ. Found., Inc. v. Cox, 408 F.3d 1349, 1352 (11th Cir. 2005) (“A \nplaintiff need not have the franchise wholly denied to suffer injury… [State resident’s] alleged \ninjuries flow directly from the denial of her registration form.”); Ferrand v.

Ga. 2012). \nIt is undisputed that (1) Plaintiffs are eligible Texas voters who changed their driver’s \nlicense addresses online and checked “yes” in response to the question “I would like to register \nto vote,” and (2) Defendants did not treat this transaction as a simultaneous voter registration \napplication. The material facts are settled. Summary judgment is warranted here because these \nundisputed facts establish as a matter of law that Defendants violate the NVRA and the Equal \nProtection  Clause  by  failing  to  treat  online  driver’s  license  renewals  or  change-of-address \napplications as simultaneous applications to register to vote or update voter registration, in \nglaring contrast to the way that in-person and mail transactions are treated. For these reasons, \nPlaintiffs are entitled to summary judgment in their favor on all claims. \nA.  Texas’ failure to treat online DPS transactions as voter registration applications \nviolates the NVRA \n \n1.  The plain language of the NVRA controls \n \n“Statutory construction, of course, begins with the plain language of statute.” In re Dale, \n582 F.3d 568, 573 (5th Cir. 2009). Where the plain language of the statute is clear, federal courts \nare compelled to apply the statute’s mandate. Multiple courts have struck down state policies in \nviolation of the plain language mandates of the NVRA. Action NC v. Strach, 216 F. Supp. 3d \n597, 633-634 (M.D. N.C. 2016) (finding that a plain language interpretation of Section 5 of the \n14 \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 77   Filed 06/30/17   Page 20 of 32\n \nNVRA includes remote driver’s license transactions);  Fish v. Kobach, 840 F.3d 710, 732-740 \n(10th Cir. 2016) (upholding plain language interpretation of Section 5 of the NVRA to preempt \nstate  law  requiring  more  than  “minimum  amount  of  information  necessary”  for  voter \nregistration); Project Vote/Voting for Am., Inc. v. Long, 682 F.3d 331, 335 (4th Cir. 2012) \n(upholding plain language interpretation of Section 8 of the NVRA to allow for disclosure of \nvoter registration applications); Action NC v. Strach, 216 F. Supp. 3d 597, 633-634 (M.D. N.C. \n2016) (finding that a plain language interpretation of Section 5 of the NVRA includes remote \ndriver’s license transactions); Ga. State Conference of N.A.A.C.P., 841 F. Supp. 2d at 1329, \n1330, 1335 (finding, in part, that plain language interpretation of Section 7 of the NVRA requires \nan assistance office supplying an application for assistance to distribute voter registration and \nvoter preference forms regardless of whether the application was made in person). In its Order \ndenying Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss, this Court found the state violates the plain language of \nthe  NVRA  in  failing  to  allow  online  DPS  transactions  to  serve  as  voter  registration \napplications.59  \n2.  Defendants  fail  to  treat  online  driver’s  license  renewal  applications  as \n“simultaneous”  voter  registration  applications  in  violation  of  52  U.S.C.  §§ \n20503(a)(1), 20504(a)(1), and 20504(a)(2). \n \nThe NVRA requires that “each” driver’s license application, including “any” renewal \napplication, simultaneously serve as an application for voter registration.60 Moreover, the NVRA \nmandates that each voter registration application submitted to the state motor vehicle authority as \npart of a driver’s license application, including any renewal application, update any previous \nregistration by the applicant.61   \n                                                 \n59 Dkt. 52 at 14. \n60 52 U.S.C. §§ 20503(a)(1), 20504(a)(1), 20504(c)(1); Dkt. 52 at 11, 18. \n61 52 U.S.C. § 20504(a)(2). \n15 \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 77   Filed 06/30/17   Page 21 of 32\n \nAs set out above, Defendants do not, and cannot, dispute that the NVRA applies to all \ndriver’s license application transactions, including online transactions. Action NC v. Strach, 216 \nF.Supp.3d at 622-23 (holding that “the words “each” and “any” in Section 5 require voter \nregistration  services  to  be  provided  with  all  covered  transactions[,]”  including  remote \napplication, renewal, and change-of-address transactions). Nor do they dispute that in Texas, \ndriver’s license renewal applications submitted to DPS online do not serve as simultaneous \napplications for voter registration, or that Defendants do not treat driver’s license change-of-\naddress  applications  submitted  to  DPS  online  as  updating  an  applicant’s  previous  voter \nregistration.  Instead,  Defendants  claim  that  the  NVRA  merely  requires  a  “simultaneous \nopportunity to  apply to register vote,”  contorting the plain language  of the  NVRA.  Under \nDefendants’ reading of the law, states are allowed to force voters to take additional steps to \nregister to vote after completing their DPS transaction. \nThis Court considered and rejected Texas’s argument, concluding that while a voter’s \nregistration need not be “effected simultaneously with their NVRA-covered driver’s license \ntransaction,” the NVRA requires that the actual application for voter registration be simultaneous \nwith the NVRA-covered driver’s license application in “a single transaction.”62 Accordingly, \n“[w]here, as here, Defendants have chosen to offer an online forum for NVRA-covered driver’s \nlicense transactions, the NVRA thus  requires them to  accept  voter registration applications \nthrough that forum simultaneously with the NVRA-covered driver’s license submissions that \nforum supports.”63   \n \n \n                                                 \n62 Dkt. 52 at 11. \n63 Id. at 20. \n16 \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 77   Filed 06/30/17   Page 22 of 32\n \n3.  Defendants fail to treat online driver’s license change-of-address applications as \nnotifications for voter registration in violation of 52 U.S.C. § 20504(d). \n \nUnder the NVRA, all change-of-address forms submitted “in accordance with State law \nfor purposes of a State motor vehicle driver’s license” must also serve as a notification of \nchange-of-address for voter registration purposes “unless the registrant states on the form that the \nchange-of-address is not for voter registration purposes.”64 Driver’s license “change-of-address \nforms must have equal effect as voter registration change-of-address forms[.]”65 DPS concedes \nthat a customer who has changed his driver’s license address online—like each of the Plaintiffs \nhere—has done so in accordance with state law, which does not impose a signature requirement \non changes of address. It is undisputed that Defendants do not treat these online submissions to \nDPS as notifications of change-of-address for voter registration purposes. As this Court found, \nthis “is inconsistent with the plain language of the NVRA.”66  \n4.  Defendants’  requirement  that  applicants  submit  a  separate  voter  registration \napplication upon completion of online transactions violates the NVRA’s prohibition \nagainst requiring duplicative information, 52 U.S.C. § 20504(c)(2).  \n \nThe NVRA states that the voter-registration section of driver’s license application forms \n“may not require any information that duplicates information required in the driver’s license \nportion of the form[.]”67 This Court held that Defendants’ procedures violate the NVRA’s limits \non duplicative information requirements, as the separate voter registration form that DPS directs \nits customers to complete after an online transaction duplicates almost entirely the information \nrequired by DPS’ online change-of-address form and combined change-of-address and renewal \nform.68 “Indeed, it is the same form that prospective voters would use if they had not submitted \nan online change-of-address form at all, and merely applied to the Secretary of State for voter \n                                                 \n64 52 U.S.C. § 20504(d); Dkt. 52 at 11. \n65 Id. at 14. \n66 Id. \n67 52 U.S.C.§ 20504(c)(2); Dkt. 52 at 12. \n68 Dkt. 52 at 12. \n17 \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 77   Filed 06/30/17   Page 23 of 32\n \nregistration in person or by mail in the first instance.”69 To comply with the NVRA, then, \nDefendants must allow customers who complete online change-of-address and license renewal \nforms to apply to register to vote as part of the same application.70  \n5.  Defendants’ failure to transmit voter registration information submitted during \nonline driver’s license transactions violates 52 U.S.C. § 20504(e).  \nThe NVRA mandates that states transmit completed voter-registration portions of driver’s \nlicense applications “to the appropriate State election official not later than 10 days after the date \nof acceptance[,]” or, if the application is completed within 5 days before the last day of a \nregistration period, “not later than 5 days after the date of acceptance.”71 It is undisputed that \nDPS does not even record—and therefore cannot transmit—applicants’ responses to the voter \nregistration question on the online driver’s license renewal and change-of-address application. \nFurther, despite collecting from each online customer the personal information necessary for \nvoter registration, DPS does not transmit this information to SOS for those customers who wish \nto register or update their voter registration. Defendants’ failure to do so violates the clear \nmandate of the NVRA.  \n6.  SOS’s  failure  to  ensure  that  eligible  applicants  are  registered  to  vote  upon \ncompletion of the voter registration portion of online driver’s license change-of-\naddress and renewal applications violates 52 U.S.C. § 20507(a)(1)(A).  \n \nBeing responsible for Texas’s compliance with the NVRA, SOS must ensure that eligible \napplicants  are registered to  vote in  an election “if the valid voter registration form  of the \napplicant is submitted to the appropriate State motor vehicle authority not later than the lesser of \n30 days, or the period provided by State law, before the date of the election.”72 As set out above \nand in this Court’s previous ruling, under the NVRA, online driver license renewal and change-\nof-address forms are valid voter registration applications. Thus, individuals who indicate that \n                                                 \n69 Id. \n70 Id. \n71 52 U.S.C. §§ 20504(e)(1)-(2). \n72 52 U.S.C. § 20507(a)(1)(A). \n18 \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 77   Filed 06/30/17   Page 24 of 32\n \nthey want to register to vote during an online driver’s license transaction should be registered to \nvote.  \nIt is undisputed that Texas does not, in fact, register eligible customers who indicate they \nwish to register to vote or update their voter registration during an online driver’s license renewal \nor change-of-address transaction. SOS’s failure to ensure that Texas does so constitutes a plain \nviolation of the NVRA. \nB.  Texas’ failure to treat online DPS transactions as voter registration applications \nviolates the Equal Protection Clause \n \n1.  The Equal Protection Clause protects against restrictions that place unreasonable \nburdens on the right to vote. \nThe right to vote is a fundamental right protected under the Equal Protection Clause of \nthe Fourteenth Amendment. Harper v. Va. State Bd. of Elections, 383 U.S. 663, 670 (1966). \n“The  right  to  vote  is  protected  in  more  than  the  initial  allocation  of  the  franchise.  Equal \nprotection applies as well to the manner of its exercise.” Bush v. Gore, 531 U.S. 98, 104 (2000). \nSpecifically,  the  “Equal  Protection  Clause  applies  when  a  state  either  classifies  voters  in \ndisparate ways… or places restrictions on the right to vote.” Obama for Am. v. Husted, 697 F.3d \n423, 428 (6th Cir. 2012). When assessing an Equal Protection Clause challenge to a state \nrestriction on the right to vote, courts use the standard laid out in Anderson v. Celebrezze, 460 \nU.S. 780 (1983) and Burdick v. Takushi, 504 U.S. 428, 434 (1992). Under the Anderson-Burdick \nstandard, a court  \nmust weigh “the character and magnitude of the asserted injury to the rights \nprotected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments that the plaintiff seeks to \nvindicate” against “the precise interests put forward by the [s]tate as justifications \nfor the burden imposed by its rule,” taking into consideration “the extent to which \nthose interests make it necessary to burden the plaintiff's rights.”  \n \nBurdick, 504 U.S. at 434 (quoting Anderson, 460 U.S. at 789). \nIn Crawford v. Marion County Election Bd., the Supreme Court, applying the Anderson-\nBurdick standard, noted that “rather than applying any ‘litmus test’ that would neatly separate \n19 \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 77   Filed 06/30/17   Page 25 of 32\n \nvalid from invalid restrictions, …a court must identify and evaluate the interests put forward by \nthe State as justifications for the burden imposed by its rule, and then make the ‘hard judgment’ \nthat our adversary system demands.” 553 U.S. 181, 190 (2008). The Court further explained that, \nhowever slight a burden a state restriction on an individual voter may appear, “it must be \njustified by relevant and legitimate state interests ‘sufficiently weighty to justify the limitation.’” \nCrawford, 553 U.S. at 191 (citing Norman v. Reed, 502 U.S. 279, 288–89 (1992)). A sufficiently \nweighty justification is the difference between a reasonable and an unreasonable restriction. \nCrawford at 190 (citing Burdick, 504 U.S. at 434).  \nDefendants  fail  to  provide  any  rational  reason—much  less  a  “sufficiently  weighty” \njustification—for the burden they impose on the right to vote in Texas. Therefore, Defendants’ \ntreatment of online DPS transactions violates the Equal Protection Clause.      \n2.  Defendants’  refusal  to  treat  online  driver’s  license  transactions  as  voter \nregistration applications unduly burdens Plaintiffs’ right to vote.  \n \nPlaintiffs are eligible Texas voters who changed their driver’s license address online, and \nthose online transactions were not used to register Plaintiffs to vote. There is no dispute that \nTexas treats some driver’s license applications as applications to register to vote, and also does \nnot treat other driver’s license applications (online) as applications to register to vote. And there \nis no dispute that Texas refuses to provide a simultaneous voter registration application for \npeople who are similarly situated to in-person or mail-in applicants in every way but one—they \ncompleted their transactions online.   \nInstead of using the information customers already provide to DPS to register them to \nvote or update their voter registration information, Texas burdens customers who transact with \nDPS online with a requirement that they retrieve, complete, print, and mail an entirely separate \nvoter registration form in order to register or update their voter registration information. This \nburden is borne by online customers; DPS customers who apply for or change their license \n20 \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 77   Filed 06/30/17   Page 26 of 32\n \ninformation in person, or change their address by mail, are not required to complete a separate, \nadditional voter registration application in order to register or update their voter registration \ninformation. This burden is a restriction on the fundamental right to vote that warrants “the \ndemonstration  of  a  corresponding  interest  sufficiently  weighty  to  justify  the  limitation.” \nDefendants have no such justification.  \n3.  Defendants’ asserted interest in requiring handwritten signatures is insufficient to \njustify the burdens created by their treatment of online DPS transactions.  \n \nDefendants’ only justification for this burden is that DPS’s online customers cannot sign \nthe online driver’s license form, and they claim that such a handwritten signature is necessary to \n“later check that signature against the poll book.” 73 The record, however, demonstrates that the \nstate  does  not  even  use  handwritten  signatures  for  voter  registration  or  voter  verification \npurposes.  Instead,  DPS  collects  and  SOS  and  counties  use  electronic  signatures  of  voters. \nIndeed, even though a DPS customer who indicates he wishes to register to vote on a mail-in \nchange-of-address form provides DPS with a handwritten signature on that mail-in form, the \nsignature DPS sends to SOS for voter registration purposes—and the signature SOS transmits to \ncounty election officials for voter registration—is the previously-provided electronic signature \ncollected during the customer’s most recent in-person transaction. \nAlthough the state has an interest in verifying voter identity at the polls, this interest has \nnothing  to  do  with  the  handwritten  signatures  collected  by  DPS  during  driver’s  license \ntransactions, since the state only collects uses electronic signatures on DPS customers’ voter \nregistration  applications.  This  interest  is  therefore  irrelevant  to  and  insufficient  to  justify \nDefendants  restriction  on  Plaintiffs  registering  to  vote  during  an  online  driver’s  license \ntransaction.   \n                                                 \n73 Defs. Reply in Supp. of Mot. to Dismiss, Dkt. 12 pp 2-3.  \n21 \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 77   Filed 06/30/17   Page 27 of 32\n \nDefendants also claim that they treat everyone equally because the signature requirement \napplies  to  everyone,  and  that  everyone  who  fails  to  sign  a  change-of-address  or  renewal \napplication  is  not  registered  to  vote.  Defendants  fundamentally  misunderstand  the  Equal \nProtection Clause’s application to state-imposed burdens on the right to vote. Crawford, 553 \nU.S. at 190, 191. The Equal Protection Clause requires states to justify the burden they impose \non the right to vote. Burdick, 504 U.S. at 434 (quoting Anderson, 460 U.S. at 789). Defendants’ \nhandwritten signature argument is insufficient to justify the burden that the state applies to online \nDPS customers. \n4.  DPS’s signature requirement as to online transactions is unreasonable. \n  As pointed out by the Court, Defendants have not explained, and cannot explain, how the \nhandwritten signature requirement is necessary.74 As the Court observed, because DPS collects \nelectronic signatures during every in-person driver’s license transaction—including customers’ \nfirst applications for a Texas driver’s license—DPS already has a signature on file for every \nperson who subsequently renews or changes their driver’s license address.75 Indeed, Defendants \nadmitted that the handwritten signature on DPS forms is scanned and stored in a third-party \nvendor’s system for identity-verification use only when fraud is suspected. For DPS purposes \nand  voter  registration  purposes,  Defendants  simply  use  and  store  the  signature  that  was \nelectronically captured in the most recent previous in-person transaction. Defendants cannot \nshow why handwritten signatures are necessary to confirm voter identity at the polls when \ncollected, stored, and easily-accessible electronically-captured signatures do the same thing just \nas well, if not more efficiently, and when Texas already uses these electronic signature for this \npurpose for in-person and mail-in DPS applications. Anderson, 460 U.S. at 806 (quoting Kusper \nv. Pontikes, 414 U.S. 51, 59 (1973) (“If the [s]tate has open to it a less drastic way of satisfying \n                                                 \n74 Dkt. 52 at 21. \n75 Id. at 17, 21. \n22 \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 77   Filed 06/30/17   Page 28 of 32\n \nits legitimate interests, it may not choose a legislative scheme that broadly stifles the exercise of \nfundamental personal liberties.”); Northeast Ohio Coalition for the Homeless v. Husted, 837 F.3d \n612, 633 (6th Cir. 2016), (cert. denied, 2017 WL 881266 (U.S. June 19, 2017) (restriction \npurportedly imposed to combat voter fraud was unjustified, in part, because the state already had \na policy in place that sufficiently protected against voter fraud).  \nMoreover, as set out above, DPS’s online system utilizes a four-point data verification \nprocess, which, as the Court points out, allows an online customer to verify his identity at login, \ninstead of using a handwritten signature.76 This verification process ensures that the individual \ntransacting online is the person who previously provided an electronic signature during his last \nin-person transaction with DPS, and would likewise ensure that the electronic signature used for \nvoter registration and voter verification belongs to the proper individual. With no sufficient \njustification for the state’s restrictions on online transactions, the burden on Plaintiffs’ right to \nvote is unreasonable.  \nC.  Defendants’ Affirmative Defenses are Not Supported by Evidence \nDefendants assert the following affirmative defenses: (1) failure to state a claim upon \nwhich relief can be granted, (2) Eleventh Amendment immunity and sovereign immunity, (3) \nstatute of limitations, (4) all actions by Defendants relevant to the claims and causes of action by \nPlaintiffs were done in good faith and without malice, willfulness, or intent, (5) lack of standing \nand  failure  to  demonstrate  injury-in-fact,  causation,  or  redressability  necessary  to  establish \nstanding, (6) Plaintiffs have not exhausted administrative requirements for filing suit, (7) failure \nto satisfy the conditions precedent required to invoke the Court’s jurisdiction over their claims, \nincluding  the  pre-suit  notice  requirements  of  the  NVRA,  52  U.S.C.  §  20510(b)(1)-(2),  (8) \n                                                 \n76 Id. at 18. Confusingly, the SOS allows voters to change their voter registration address online \nwithout a signature if they have moved within a county. The state only requires a signature when \na voter moves from one county to another. Appx. 97 (Ex. 13, SOS’s Suppl. Resps. to Stringer’s \nFirst RFAs, No. 10). \n23 \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 77   Filed 06/30/17   Page 29 of 32\n \nmisrepresentation, (9) Plaintiffs’ claims are moot, (10) the Court lacks jurisdiction, and (11) \nDefendants’ actions were reasonable and proper under the laws of the United States and the State \nof Texas. Defendants have put forth no evidence to support their affirmative defenses. In fact, \nsome of the listed defenses bear no logical explanation for pleading (e.g., statute of limitations). \nFurther, some of the claimed defenses were summarily rejected by this Court in its ruling on the \nMotion  to  Dismiss:  the  state’s  standing  arguments,77  the  state’s  arguments  regarding  the \nNVRA’s notice requirement,78 and the state’s “failure to state a claim” arguments.79  \nD.  Defendants should be required to correct their violations of the NVRA within three \nmonths of the Court’s ruling. \n \n  The next federal voter registration deadline is February 5, 2018, in advance of the March \nprimary  elections—just  over  seven  months  from  the  date  of  this  filing.  For  far  too  long, \nDefendants have defied the NVRA and denied millions of Texas the right to register or update \ntheir voter registration through an online transaction with DPS. Plaintiffs, and eligible Texas \nvoters who are similarly situated, are entitled to immediate relief, before the start of another \nfederal election cycle. Accordingly, the Court should require Defendants to update their systems \nto allow for compliance with the NVRA as to online driver’s license transactions immediately, \nwith full implementation within three months after the Court’s ruling and no later than January 1, \n2018.  \nMoreover,  the  public  interest  is  served  by  requiring  Defendants  to  immediately \nimplement this plan. Namely, the almost 1.5 million customers who transact online with DPS \neach year will be irreparably injured if Defendants continue to defy federal law and the United \nStates  Constitution.  The  requested  relief  is  the  only  way  to  correct  Defendants’  continued \n                                                 \n77 Dkt. 52 at 3-7.  \n78 Id. at 7-9. \n79 Id. at 9-21. \n24 \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 77   Filed 06/30/17   Page 30 of 32\n \nviolations  of  the  NVRA  and  Equal  Protection  Clause  with  regard  to  these  transactions. \nMonitoring to ensure compliance will be necessary.  \nCONCLUSION \nPlaintiffs respectfully request for the Court to enter an order: \n1.  Declaring, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2201 and 52 U.S.C. § 20510(b)(2), that Defendants \nhave violated the NVRA and the Equal Protection Clause by failing to provide for \nsimultaneous voter registration application with online driver’s license renewal; \n2.

Permanently  enjoining  Defendants,  their  agents  and  successors  in  office,  and  all \ncustomers working in concert with them, from implementing practices and procedures \nthat likewise violate the NVRA;  \n4.

HUGHS, et al.,         § \nDefendants.          §   \n \nDEFENDANTS’ REPLY TO TEXAS DEMOCRATIC PARTY, DSCC, AND DCCC’S  \nCONSOLIDATED REPLY IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT AND IN \nOPPOSITION TO DEFENDANTS’ CROSS-MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT \n \nPlaintiff-Intervenors1 fail in their final attempt to demonstrate standing because they cannot \novercome the facts: they have not suffered any legally cognizable injury and they have not proven they \nhave members who would have standing to bring this claim. Rather than demonstrate to the Court \nspecifically how Defendants’ practices have affected them or describe the particular measures that \nthey have taken to counteract those effects, Intervenors are content simply to recount their normal \nvoter  registration  efforts.  But  this  is  insufficient  for  them  to  prove  their  standing.  Likewise, \nIntervenors make little effort to demonstrate their membership structure beyond providing self-\nserving and uncorroborated declarations. But Intervenors have not proven that they have membership \nthat meets Article III requirements or that any purported member has standing. \nEven if Intervenors did have standing (they do not), their Equal Protection claim still fails. \nThe weighty State interests in maintaining the integrity of elections and the voter rolls defeat \nIntervenors’ claim. Accordingly, the Court should deny Plaintiff-Intervenors’ Motion for Summary \nJudgment,  grant  Defendants’  Counter-Motion  for  Summary  Judgment,  and  dismiss  Plaintiff-\nIntervenors’ claims. \n \n1 “Plaintiff-Intervenors” or “Intervenors” refers to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (“DSCC”), \nDemocratic Congressional Campaign Committee (“DCCC”), and Texas Democratic Party (“TDP”).  \n1 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 92   Filed 07/03/20   Page 2 of 11\nI.  Plaintiff-Intervenors’ Improper Declarations Should Be Disregarded \nIntervenors flout the Court’s orders and their discovery obligations by submitting improper \ndeclarations at the eleventh hour in a vain effort to salvage their claims. But this evidence is too little \nand too late, and the Court should disregard Intervenors’ declarations. \nThe Court ordered an expedited discovery period that ended on April 30, 2020, which allowed \nDefendants to explore Plaintiff-Intervenors’ standing. See, e.g., Dkt. No. 61. Each of the Intervenors \nwas  served  with  substantially  identical  discovery  that  requested  them  to  produce  all  evidence \nsupporting “[t]he allegations in their Complaint and the factual bases therefor,” among many other \ndetailed requests. See Dkt. No. 78-1 at 118-124; Dkt. No. 85-1 at 35-40; Dkt. No. 86 at 76-81. \nIntervenors did not produce the documents that they now attach as exhibits to their late-filed \ndeclarations, and Intervenors did not testify to the facts that they now explain via declaration. Plaintiff-\nIntervenors then filed their motion for summary judgment, to which they attached none of the \nevidence that they now submit. Despite this gamesmanship, Plaintiff-Intervenors make no attempt to \nexplain or justify their failure to produce this evidence during discovery. \nThe Court should not countenance Intervenors’ disregard for their obligation to provide \ncomplete discovery responses, and it should not reward their behavior by considering this improper, \neleventh-hour evidence that Defendants were denied the opportunity to test during discovery. These \ndeclarations  contradict  Intervenors’  deposition  testimony,2  improperly  expand  their  discovery \nresponses,3 and weaponize Intervenors’ vague privilege objections by attempting to use the First \nAmendment and the attorney-client relationship as both a shield and a sword.4 Yet Intervenors make \n \n2 For example, TDP testified that the donations they received could not be earmarked for specific purposes, \nsee, e.g., TDP Depo. at 59:21-60:3 (Dkt. No. 78-1), yet they now have produced evidence suggesting that this \nwas inaccurate, see, e.g., Dkt. No. 90-2 at 7-30. \n3 For example, Intervenors did not produce any evidence from Jada Thompson or Alicia Sisneros, nor did they \neven disclose their identities. Compare Dkt Nos. 90-1, 90-4 with Dkt. Nos. 78-1, 85, 86, 87. \n4 Intervenors hid behind vague and spurious privilege objections throughout all their depositions, including, \nfor example, a refusal to answer even basic questions about the work being performed by the very consultant \n2 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 92   Filed 07/03/20   Page 3 of 11\nno attempt to justify their earlier non-disclosure. See, e.g., Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(c)(1) (“If a party fails to \nprovide information [during discovery], the party is not allowed to use that information or witness to \nsupply evidence on a motion, at a hearing, or at a trial . . . .”); In re Itron, Inc., 883 F.3d 553, 558 (5th \nCir. 2018) (“[P]rivilege cannot ‘be used as both sword and shield.’”). Accordingly, Defendants submit \nthat the Court should not give these declarations any weight whatsoever.  \nBut even if the Court does consider this evidence—which it should not—Intervenors have \nstill failed to demonstrate standing, as discussed below. \nII.  Plaintiff-Intervenors Cannot Demonstrate Standing \n  A.  There Is No Organizational Injury-in-Fact \nPlaintiff-Intervenors have no standing to sue in their own right because they have not suffered \na cognizable injury-in-fact. Under any theory that they have put forward, Intervenors’ assertion of \nstanding falls short. \n    1.  Alleged Diversion of Resources \nTo the extent that Plaintiff-Intervenors rely on a diversion-of-resources theory, Intervenors’ \nvoter registration efforts are not, and have never been, designed to counteract the practices at issue \nhere, and they have never targeted a voter with their registration efforts because that voter transacted \nonline regarding their driver license. Intervenors’ improper affidavits and soaring prose boil down to \nthe same unavailing argument that because some people who have transacted online regarding their \ndriver license may be swept up in Intervenors’ voter registration efforts, they have standing to \nchallenge the laws and practices at issue. But Intervenors have never sought to target such voters and \nwould engage in the same conduct regardless of Defendants’ practices. See, e.g., Dkt. No. 90-2 ¶ 4 \n(“Registering new voters is one of the TDP’s principal purposes.”).  \n \nwhose declaration they now submit. See, e.g., DCCC Depo. at 82:15-19, 98:21-99:22, 100:19-101:6, 102:7-15 \n(Dkt. No. 85); see also Dkt. No. 43-2 ¶ 7. \n3 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 92   Filed 07/03/20   Page 4 of 11\nThis is a dispositive distinction according to the Fifth Circuit, see ACORN v. Fowler, 178 F.3d \n350 (5th Cir. 1999), yet Intervenors make no serious effort to engage with it. Instead, they merely seek \nto substitute a different kind of voter. For the first time, Intervenors argue that they “seek to register \nvoters who have recently moved,” Dkt. No. 89 at 4, and that TDP is “seeking to register every voter \nwho lives in an apartment complex,” including by placing “voter registration applications and \ninstructions on the doors of 65,000 apartments in Travis County in January 2020.” Dkt. No. 89 at 5. \nThey further argue that TDP’s deputy registrars educate voters about “how online driver license \ntransactions interact with voter registration,” and that DCCC’s consultant spends time to “train its \ndeputy registrars to inform voters that online DPS transactions do not update a voter’s registration.” \nDkt. No. 89 at 5. But the online transaction itself informs a voter of this. See, e.g., Dkt. No. 1-4 at 5, \n10-11, 16. And it is not an injury to instruct volunteers about particular means of voter registration \nwhen they are being trained in voter registration procedures already. See, e.g., Fair Elections Ohio v. \nHusted, 770 F.3d 456, 459-60 (6th Cir. 2014) (“[I]t is not an injury to instruct election volunteers about \nabsentee voting procedures when the volunteers are being trained in voting procedures already.”). \nIntervenors argue that they need not quantify the resources diverted for such diversion to \nconfer standing. But even if that is so, the diversion still must be “identifiable.” See OCA-Greater Hous. \nv. Texas, 867 F.3d 604, 612 (5th Cir. 2017). Intervenors still point only to their expenditures on voter \nregistration  generally,  without  identifying  resources  dedicated  specifically  to  voters  who  have \ntransacted with DPS online. See Dkt. No. 89 at 14-17. Simply put, Intervenors’ voter registration \nefforts constitute their “daily operations.” OCA-Greater Hous., 867 F.3d at 612. And they have done \nnothing to target those activities specifically toward remedying the alleged wrong, which is fatal to \ntheir assertion of injury based on a diversion-of-resources theory. See Fowler, 178 F.3d at 359. \n \n \n4 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 92   Filed 07/03/20   Page 5 of 11\n    2.  Purported Harm to Electoral Prospects \nPlaintiff-Intervenors’ attempt to predicate injury on an alleged harm to electoral prospects \nsimilarly fails. Intervenors rely on only two things to support this theory: Ms. Thompson’s declaration \nexpressing an unfulfilled desire to vote for Beto O’Rourke in a 2018 election, and the 1.6 percent \nmargin of victory by which Senator Ted Cruz defeated Congressman O’Rourke therein. See Dkt. No. \n89 at 23. This is entitled to no weight because Ms. Thompson’s declaration was disclosed far too late \nto be considered, and Intervenors never produced or indicated they were relying on the third-party \nwebsite that they now cite at the eleventh hour. Moreover, even if properly before the Court, this \nwould prove nothing about any harm to any future electoral prospects. There is nothing to suggest \nthat the particular practices Intervenors challenge had any significant impact on any past election. And \nmore importantly, Intervenors have no evidence that these particular practices will harm any future \nelection, which is the relevant inquiry for the prospective injunctive relief that they seek.  \nIn the absence of any factual record to support their electoral-prospects theory, Intervenors \ninstead rely on distinguishable and non-binding authority. See Dkt. No. 89 at 22-24. Intervenors’ sole \nFifth Circuit case, Texas Democratic Party v. Benkiser, 459 F.3d 582 (5th Cir. 2006), is wholly inapposite \nbecause it addressed the removal and replacement of one of TDP’s opponents on the eve of an \nelection, supported by specific witness testimony about that particular contest. See id. at 586-87. \nConversely, Intervenors’ alleged harm here is based on the diffuse and unproven effects of their voter \nregistration efforts—none of which have been targeted at voters transacting online regarding their \ndriver license—and in the absence of any specificity regarding the voters, resources, or election \ncontests that may be harmed. Intervenors’ other authorities are similarly unavailing.5 The most that \n \n5 For example, in Pavek v. Simon, No. 19-CV-3000 (SRN/DTS), 2020 WL 3183249, (D. Minn. June 15, 2020), \na challenge to a ballot-order statute, there was “undisputed expert evidence [] that the primacy effect exists and \nhas benefitted every major political party in Minnesota over the last 36 years,” and there was also “undisputed \nexpert evidence [] that the primacy effect ‘almost always’ occurs for the first-listed candidate solely as a result \n5 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 92   Filed 07/03/20   Page 6 of 11\ncan be said, then, is that Intervenors’ have an “interest in a problem” and a “generalized partisan \npreference” that is not sufficient to demonstrate standing. See Gill v. Whitford, 138 S. Ct. 1916, 1933 \n(2018); Sierra Club v. Morton, 405 U.S. 727, 739 (1972). \nB.  Plaintiff-Intervenors Cannot Assert Associational Standing on Behalf of \nAny Member \n \nBecause Intervenors cannot demonstrate that they have standing to proceed as organizations, \nthey must show that an identified member would have standing to proceed in their own right and on \nwhose behalf Intervenors can bring a claim. It is unsurprising that Intervenors complain about being \naccountable to the requirements of Article III standing as “exalt[ing] form over substance,” see Dkt. \nNo.  89  at  18,  because  they  have  failed  to  demonstrate  that  an  identifiable  member  of  their \norganizations would have standing to sue in their own right. Instead Intervenors point to provisions \nof the Texas Election Code that have nothing to do with Article III standing, cf. Tex. Elec. Code \n§ 162.001 (describing the effects of affiliation), and they discuss at length who they “consider” to be \ntheir members,6 see Dkt. No. 89 at 17-22. But Intervenors do not point to any authority suggesting \nthat either of these bases is sufficient to satisfy Article III’s standing requirements. Indeed, the \nSupreme Court has expressly rejected the contention that standing can be established by “‘accepting \nthe organization’s self-description of the activities of its members’ and determining that ‘there is a \nstatistical probability that some of those members are threatened with concrete injury.’” Funeral \nConsumers All., Inc. v. Serv. Corp. Int’l, 695 F.3d 330, 343-44 (5th Cir. 2012) (quoting Summers v. Earth \nIsland Inst., 555 U.S. 488, 497 (2009)). And the mere fact that individuals may donate to the Intervenors \nis insufficient. See Hunt v. Washington St. Apple Advert. Comm’n, 432 U.S. 333, 343-44 (1977). \n \nof their first-listed position.” Id. at *14. Intervenors’ ability to provide the caliber of evidence that was before \nthe Minnesota district court only highlights the inexcusable inadequacy of their factual showing in this litigation. \n6 These late assertions about whom Intervenors consider their members—which should be disregarded entirely, \nfor the reasons stated above—either directly contradict the deposition testimony or are entirely without support \nin the record, at least with respect to DCCC and DSCC. See, e.g., DCCC Depo. at 108:2-109:5 (Dkt. No. 85). \n6 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 92   Filed 07/03/20   Page 7 of 11\nEven if any of the individuals that Intervenors point to could be construed as Intervenors’ \nmembers, none of them has standing to sue in their own right. Defendants have repeatedly briefed \nfor this Court the reasons why the Individual Plaintiffs in this litigation do not have standing, and \ntherefore will not repeat those arguments here. See, e.g., Dkt. Nos. 60, 74. With respect to Ms. \nThompson, as discussed above, her declaration and all of the other evidence about her was not \nproduced during the Court-ordered expedited discovery period, despite its obvious responsiveness to \nseveral of Defendants’ discovery requests and deposition questions, and therefore any evidence related \nto her should not be considered. But even if the Court did consider Ms. Thompson’s declaration, and \neven if the Court found that she was a member of any of the Intervenor organizations, she would not \nhave standing under the clear standard set forth by the Fifth Circuit in Stringer I. See Stringer v. Whitley \n(Stringer I), 942 F.3d 715 (5th Cir. 2019). Ms. Thompson is registered to vote at her current address \nwith no present intention to change residence, see Dkt. No. 90-1 ¶¶ 13-14, and therefore Intervenors \nhave not demonstrated “a substantial risk that [she] will attempt to update [her] voter registration[] \nusing the DPS System and be injured by [her] inability to do so.” Stringer I, 942 F.3d at 723. Because \nnone of the Intervenors have identified a member who would have standing to bring Intervenors’ \nclaims, they cannot proceed on behalf of any of their members. \nFinally, as Intervenors’ own briefing demonstrates, they also fail to establish associational \nstanding because their standing to bring any claim cannot be litigated without participation of the \nindividual members themselves. See Texans United for a Safe Econ. Educ. Fund v. Crown Cent. Petroleum \nCase Corp., 207 F.3d 789, 792 (5th Cir. 2000) (citing Hunt, 432 U.S. at 343; Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. \nChevron Chem. Co., 129 F.3d 826, 827-28 (5th Cir. 1997)). Intervenors rely on declarations by the people \nwho Intervenors hold out as members, and testing each of those individuals’ assertions of standing is \na fact-intensive inquiry that requires discovery into their individual circumstances. Because of the \nstandard described by the Fifth Circuit in Stringer I, 942 F.3d at 723, individual participation is required \n7 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 92   Filed 07/03/20   Page 8 of 11\nto litigate Intervenors’ claims, thereby defeating any assertion of associational standing based on \nmembership. \nIII.  Plaintiff-Intervenors’ Constitutional Claim is Meritless \nAlthough the Court should not reach the substance of Plaintiff-Intervenors’ allegations \nbecause they lack standing, Intervenors’ Equal Protection claim is meritless.7 \nApplying the correct standard of review is not a “distraction.” Dkt. No. 89 at 29. Intervenors’ \nderision of the Fifth Circuit opinion in Texas Democratic Party v. Abbott, 961 F.3d 389 (5th Cir. 2020), is \nunderstandable given that it is fatal to their claims. Intervenors are simply wrong when they assert that \nDefendants’ alleged conduct here disenfranchises any voter. All eligible voter registration applicants \nare subject to the same rules, and there is no ambiguity as to what a voter must do in order to register \nto vote. There are many different ways in which a voter can register, and all Texans must exercise one \nof those options before they may exercise the franchise. This is not a “blame the voter” argument, as \nIntervenors may claim, cf. Dkt. No. 89 at 24, but rather a recognition that requirements that are on par \nwith “the usual burdens of voting” do not impose an unconstitutional burden on the right to vote. \nCrawford v. Marion Cnty. Election Bd., 553 U.S. 181, 198 (2008). And where, as here, “the right to vote is \nnot ‘at stake,’” rational basis review applies. Texas Democratic Party v. Abbott, 961 F.3d at 404. \nPlaintiff-Intervenors’ attacks on the State interest in having voter registration applications \nsigned by the applicant are unavailing. Whether Defendants have a previous version of a voter’s \nsignature—collected  at  a  different  time  and  for  a  different  purpose—simply  has  no  bearing \nwhatsoever on whether the State is constitutionally permitted to require a signature on a voter \nregistration application. Submitting a voter registration application is itself a legally significant act that \n \n7 Defendants have nothing further to add to their prior briefing regarding collateral estoppel except to note \nIntervenors’ continued refusal to acknowledge the dispositive fact that the Stringer I opinion was vacated in \nentirety, meaning that it cannot have any preclusive effect. See Langley v. Price, 926 F.3d 145, 164 (5th Cir. 2019) \n(holding that a judgment reversed on appeal “retains zero preclusive effect”). \n8 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 92   Filed 07/03/20   Page 9 of 11\nTexas may lawfully require voters to undertake under signature. See, e.g., Dkt. No. 87 at 2 (noting on \nthe voter registration section of a driver license application that “giving false information to procure \na voter registration is perjury, and a crime under state and federal law”). Yet Intervenors insist that it \nis unconstitutional to require that signature for voters if they choose to transact with DPS online. \nTheir claim is simply incorrect and fails under rational basis review. \nBut even if a more stringent standard applies, Plaintiff-Intervenors’ constitutional claim still \nfails. Intervenors maintain that voter fraud is a “fiction” and combating it is an illegitimate state \ninterest, see, e.g., Dkt. No. 89 at 29 n.7, but they fail to address the substantial weight of authority \nagainst them. See, e.g., Voting for Am., Inc. v. Steen, 732 F.3d 382, 394 (5th Cir. 2013) (“Any corruption \nin voter registration affects a state’s paramount obligation to ensure the integrity of the voting process \nand threatens the public’s right to democratic government. . . . Texas need not show specific local \nevidence of fraud in order to justify preventive measures.”); see also, e.g., O’Brien v. Skinner, 414 U.S. \n524, 534 (1974) (Marshall, J., concurring) (“[P]rotection of the integrity of the ballot box is surely a \nlegitimate state concern.”); Texas Democratic Party v. Abbott, 961 F.3d at 413 (Ho, J., concurring) (“There \nshould be ‘no question about the legitimacy or importance of the State’s interest in counting only the \nvotes of eligible voters.’”) (quoting Crawford, 553 U.S. at 196). The State’s interests here outweigh \nwhatever burden is imposed by allowing voters to register via one of the many methods that Texans \nhave been using for years. Accordingly, although the Court should not reach the substance of \nIntervenors’ claim because they lack standing, Intervenors’ constitutional claim also fails on its merits. \nIV.  Plaintiff-Intervenors Are Not Entitled to Their Requested Relief \nThough no relief is warranted for the reasons explained above, even if Intervenors’ claims had \nmerit, they have not proven that their proposed injunction should be entered. Intervenors glibly \ndismiss Defendants’ concerns in ensuring that any relief that the Court may impose takes account of \nthe important State interests of the continued feasibility of its election-administration and driver-\n9 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 92   Filed 07/03/20   Page 10 of 11\nlicensing machinery. Intervenors wrongly characterize Defendants’ testimony regarding the costs and \ntiming of certain specific, targeted changes as a carte blanche for the imposition of any modifications \nthat they desire. Cf. Dkt. No. 89 at 31. But Intervenors ignore that the relief they have requested goes \nwell beyond anything that was discussed during any deposition in this litigation or that would be \nrequired to address the purported harms. See, e.g., Dkt. No. 77-1 at 793 ¶ 3(a) (requiring website \nchanges); id. at 794 ¶ 5 (requiring a public education campaign). Even if the Court were to find in \nIntervenors’ favor, which it should not, Intervenors have not proven that their requested relief is \nwarranted or feasible. Accordingly, Plaintiff-Intervenors are not entitled to their proposed injunction. \nCONCLUSION \n  For the foregoing reasons, the Court should deny Plaintiff-Intervenors’ Motion for Summary \nJudgment,  grant  Defendants’  Counter-Motion  for  Summary  Judgment,  and  dismiss  Plaintiff-\nIntervenors’ claims. \n \n   \n10 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 92   Filed 07/03/20   Page 11 of 11\nRespectfully submitted. \n \nKEN PAXTON \nAttorney General of Texas \n \nJEFFREY C.

Docket nos. 5-7, 40, 44, 69, 70, 75, 76, 91, 96. Defendants \nhave responded. Docket nos. 36, 74. On January 28, 2020, the Court held a hearing and offered \nboth sides the opportunity to present oral argument and live witnesses. Docket nos. 31, 45, 57. \nBoth sides declined to call live witnesses but did offer evidence by submission and neither side \nchallenged the admissibility of the evidence. Based on the undisputed facts, the Court granted the \n1 \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 97   Filed 08/28/20   Page 2 of 68\nmotion in part, ordered partial injunctive relief, and took the rest under advisement pending \ndiscovery and a review of the record. Stringer v. Pablos, 2020 WL 532937 (W.D. Tex. Jan. 30, \n2020); docket no. 46 (the \"first order\"). On February 2, 2020, Defendants advised the Court that \nthey had complied with the injunctive relief set forth in the Court's first order. Docket no. 48. \nAfter giving the parties an opportunity to conduct discovery and supplement the record, and upon \nfurther review, the Court finds that the remainder of the request for preliminary injunctive relief \nshould be granted for the reasons that follow. \nI. \nStatement of the case \nThis is the second of two related cases concerning Texas's compliance with the National \nVoter Registration Act (NVRA) (also known as the \"motor voter law\"), 52 U.S.C. § 20501, et. \nseq., which was enacted in 1993 under the Elections Clause to make the voter registration \nprocess easier and more convenient, thus increasing voter registration and participation. See 52 \nU.S.C.  20501(b)(1) (\"to establish procedures that will increase the number of eligible citizens \n§ \nwho register to vote\").1 This Court resolved the first case on the merits, based on largely \nuncontested facts, but the Fifth Circuit found that the individual plaintiffs lacked standing and \nnever reached the merits. See Stringer v. Pablos, 320 F. Supp. 3d 862 (W.D. Tex. 2018), rev'd \nand remanded, Stringer v.  Whitley, 942 F.3d 715 (5th Cir. 2019) (Stringer I). In this case, the \nsame underlying facts are still uncontested and remain unchanged. Thus, while the Court has \nconsidered new evidence on standing, which the Fifth Circuit found to be lacking in the first \ncase, it has relied on the facts in the Stringer I record to determine a likelihood of success on the \n'The only six states exempt from the NVRA' s requirements are those that have no voter \nregistration or allow election day voter registration at the polls. 52 U.S.C.  20503(b). Texas is not one of \n§ \nthem. See https://w'ww.justice.gov/crt/national-voter-registration-act-  993-nvra. \n1 \n2 \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 97   Filed 08/28/20   Page 3 of 68\nmerits. \nAgain, due to the timing of this case (which has been litigated under the constraints of a \npandemic) and the deadlines faced in the current election cycle, this is the second order \naddressing Plaintiffs' motion for preliminary injunctive relief. See docket no. 46. The first order \ngranted Plaintiffs' motion in part to ensure that the individual plaintiffs were registered to vote \nprior to the deadline for the primary election. This second order is entered prior to the voter \nregistration deadline for the general election to avoid further injury as a result of continuing \nnoncompliance with the NVRA. \nII. \nBackground of litigation \nA.  Stringer I \nJarrod Stringer, Benjamin Hemandez, and John Woods (\"Stringer I plaintiffs\") were \neligible Texas voters who engaged in NVRA-covered online driver's license transactions but \nwere denied simultaneous voter registration applications and thereafter disenfranchised. They \nbrought suit in 2016 asserting that the State of Texas, by and through the Department of Public \nSafety and the Secretary of State, engages in a practice that deprives Texans of their federal right \nto register to vote or update their voter registration simultaneously with their online driver's \nlicense renewal and change of address transactions. The plaintiffs alleged that this practice, \ndating back several years, violates the NYRA and Equal Protection clause. Although advised of \nthe violation, and admittedly able to change its practice and procedure, the State of Texas refused \nto integrate voter registration into its online driver's license renewal and change of address \nprocess to ensure compliance with federal law. \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 97   Filed 08/28/20   Page 4 of 68\nThe Stringer I plaintiffs sought summary judgment on their claims that Defendants' \nonline process violates the NVRA and Equal Protection clause. They also sought summary \njudgment on Defendants' affirmative defenses, including immunity, standing, and mootness. \nDefendants admitted that the key facts of the case were undisputed and argued that state law \nprevented them from complying with federal law. Defendants sought summary judgment on \nstanding, mootness, and on the merits  based on their interpretation of the NVRA, state election \nlaw, and the Equal Protection clause. \nIn May 2018, this Court granted declaratory and injunctive relief in favor of the Stringer I \nplaintiffs. The Court found, based on largely uncontested facts, that Defendants violated the \nNational Voter Registration Act, 52 U.S.C.  20503(a)(l), 20504(a), (c), (d), and (e), and \n§ \n20507(a)(l)(A), and the Equal Protection Clause, U.S. Const. amend. XIV, § 1, by failing to \npermit simultaneous voter registration with online driver's license renewal and change-of- \naddress transactions. The Court permanently enjoined Defendants from continuing to violate the \nNVRA and Equal Protection Clause and ordered them to establish procedures that treat each \nonline driver's license renewal or change-of-address application as a simultaneous application for \nvoter registration which must then be submitted to the Secretary of State. Defendants appealed to \nthe Fifth Circuit, which held that the plaintiffs did not have standing to seek prospective \ninjunctive relief because they had not shown a continuing or threatened future injury to their \nconstitutional right to vote. Chief Judge Owen wrote: \nPlaintiffs contend that they have demonstrated a substantial risk that they will suffer a \nfuture injury as a result of the DPS System's noncompliance with the NVRA and Equal \nProtection Clause. As Plaintiffs concede, to do so, they must demonstrate \"a sufficient \nprobability that each Plaintiff will use the noncompliant driver's license services again.\" \nAll three Plaintiffs declared that they \"plan to continue transacting online with [DPS] in \nthe future whenever [they are] required to renew or change the address on [their] driver's \nlicense and [are] eligible to do so.\" However, each Plaintiff will have the occasion to use \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 97   Filed 08/28/20   Page 5 of 68\nthe DPS System to update his voter registration only if(1) he moves within Texas, in \nwhich case he might wish use the DPS System to change his address on file with DPS \nand his county voter registrar, or (2) he becomes both unregistered to vote and eligible to \nrenew his driver's license using the DPS System, in which case he might wish to use the \nDPS System to renew his driver's license and register to vote. \nPlaintiffs rely on two types of evidence that they contend demonstrate a substantial risk \nthat they will move again. The first is evidence of their prior movesHernandez and \nWoods have each moved once in the past five years, and Stringer has moved several \ntimes. However, evidence that a plaintiff has taken an action in the past does not, by \nitself, demonstrate a substantial risk that the plaintiff will take the action in the future; \nthere must be some evidence that the plaintiff intends to take the action again. \nAccordingly, evidence that Plaintiffs moved in the past does not establish a substantial \nrisk that they will do so in the future. Notably, no Plaintiff has expressed any intention to \nmove in the future. \nThe second type of evidence cited by Plaintiffs is data from the United States Census \nBureau showing that Americans can expect to move 11.7 times in their lifetimes. This \ngeneral data also does not establish a substantial risk that Plaintiffs themselves will move \nagain; Plaintiff-specific evidence is needed before Plaintiffs' claims can be properly \ncharacterized as an attempt to remedy an imminent injury to Plaintiffs instead of a \ngeneralized grievance available to all Texans. \nPlaintiffs also have not demonstrated a substantial risk that they will attempt to use the \nDPS System to renew their driver's licenses and simultaneously update their voter \nregistrations. Plaintiffs contend that Texas's requirement that driver's licenses must be \nrenewed every six years and the existence of Texas laws providing multiple avenues for \nthe cancellation of a voter's registration create a \"sufficient probability\" that, at some \npoint in the future, Plaintiffs will be both unregistered to vote and eligible to renew their \ndriver's licenses using the DPS System. However, Plaintiffs do not point to any Plaintiff- \nspecific evidence suggesting that they will become unregistered and eligible to renew \ntheir driver's licenses using the DPS System. \nIn light of the absence of any Plaintiff-specific evidence, the evidence in the record does \nnot demonstrate a substantial risk that Plaintiffs will become unregistered and eligible to \nrenew their driver's licenses online. Plaintiffs cite Texas laws that provide for the \ncancellation of voter registration in four relatively uncommon situations: (1) when a \nvoter's registration card is returned as undeliverable, the voter does not return a \nconfirmation notice, and the voter does not vote in two consecutive general elections; (2) \nwhen a registrar finds a voter to be ineligible after an investigation; (3) when another \nvoter from the same county successfully challenges a voter's registration; and (4) when a \nvoter cancels his or her voter registration. There is no evidence in the record that suggests \nthat any Plaintiff is likely to fall within the ambit of these provisions. Furthermore, \nTexans are only required to renew their driver's licenses every eight years, and every \nother renewal must be accomplished in person. Chances are slim that Plaintiffs will \nbecome unregistered around the time that they need to renew their driver's licenses and \nare eligible to do so using the DPS System. \n5 \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 97   Filed 08/28/20   Page 6 of 68\nIn sum, Plaintiffs have not established a substantial risk that they will attempt to update \ntheir voter registrations using the DPS System and be injured by their inability to do so. \nAs a result, Plaintiffs have not established an injury in fact sufficient to confer standing to \npursue the declaratory and injunctive relief that they seek. \nStringer v.  Whitley, 942 F.3d at 72 1-23 (emphasis added). \nJudge Ho, concurring, stated: \nI agree with my colleagues that we are not at liberty to decide the merits in this case, \nbecause none of these Plaintiffs have standing to seek injunctive relief here. They all \nsecured their right to vote by the 2016 election cycle. And they claim no future injury that \nwe can redress today.  But although we have no occasion to decide the merits of \n.  .  . \nPlaintiffs' claim due to their lack of a future injury, that does not prevent us from \nacknowledging that Plaintiffs have indeed endured an injury in the past. They were \nunable to exercise their right to vote in past election cycles. And it is a right they will \nnever be able to recover. As citizens, we can hope it is a deprivation they will not \nexperience again  even if the law does not afford them a remedy from this court at this \ntime. \nStringer v.  Whitley, 942 F.3d at 726 (emphasis in original). \nB.  Stringer II \nAlthough the Fifth Circuit found, based on the facts in the record at that time, that Mr. \nStringer had not proven he would likely sustain another injury in the future, it did happen again. \nBefore November 23, 2019, Mr. Stringer moved from a residence in Bexar County to a new \nresidence in Harris County. On November 23, 2019, Mr. Stringer had his wife visit the DPS \nwebsite to change the address on his driver's license. He would have also had his wife update his \nvoter registration online when updating his driver's license, but was not given the option. Thus, \nhe remained registered at his old address in Bexar County when this lawsuit was filed. \nCo-plaintiff John Harms, who was not a plaintiff in Stringer I, was a resident of Bastrop \nCounty prior to July 2019. At that time, he was registered to vote and did vote in Bastrop County. \nIn mid July 2019, Mr. Harms moved from Bastrop County to Travis County, where he signed a \none-year lease on a house. On or about October 8, 2019, he visited the DPS online system and \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 97   Filed 08/28/20   Page 7 of 68\ncompleted the process to change the address on his driver's license to his new residence in Travis \nCounty. If he had been provided the option to simultaneously update his voter registration, he \nwould have done so. He was not provided that option, and he remained unregistered to vote in \nTravis County when this lawsuit was filed. \nCo-plaintiff Nayeli Gomez, who was not a plaintiff in Stringer I, moved from one \nresidence in Bexar County to a new residence in Bexar County in the Summer of 2019. On \nDecember 9, 2019, she visited the DPS online system to change the address on her driver's \nlicense to her new address but she was unable to simultaneously update her voter registration. \nShe would have simultaneously updated her voter registration if she had been given the option, \nbut she was not given that option. She remained registered at her old address when this lawsuit \nwas filed. \nIn Stringer II, current and former plaintiff Jarrod Stringer, along with current co-plaintiffs \nNayeli Gomez, John Harms, MOVE Texas Civil Fund, and League of Women Voters of Texas \nand Intervenor-plaintiffs Texas Democratic Party, DCCC, and DSCC, assert the same causes of \naction litigated in Stringer I because the Defendants have not changed their practices and new \nviolations are occurring and resulting in a continuing injury and/or threatened future injury. \nDocket no.  1. \nAt the time Plaintiffs filed this lawsuit, and at the time of the preliminary injunction \nhearing in January 2020, the following was clear: First, Mr. Stringer was suffering a second \ninjury as the result of Defendants' noncompliance with the NVRA. If Mr. Stringer's voter \nregistration was not updated before February 3, 2020, he would not be able to vote in the March \n2020 primary election in the county and precinct where he resided. Mr. Stringer also showed, in \nhis uncontested sworn declaration, that he had plans to move residences again in August 2020. \n7 \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 97   Filed 08/28/20   Page 8 of 68\nSpecifically, he and his wife planned to move out of their rental apartment and into a new \nresidence by August 25, 2020 at the latest. Docket no. 5-1, Appx. 178-180. Thus, not only was \nMr. Stringer's second injury occurring when suit was filed, but there remained a substantial risk \nof a third injury when Mr. Stringer moved again and would not be registered to vote pursuant to \nthe NVRA before the voter registration deadline for the 2020 general election. Second, Mr. \nHarms was suffering an injury as a result of Defendants' conduct that would result in \ndisenfranchisement if his voter registration was not updated before February 3, 2020 because he \nwould not be able to vote in the March 2020 primary election. Mr. Harms' sworn declaration was \nalso uncontested. Docket no. 5-1, Appx. 182-183. And third, Ms. Gomez was suffering an injury \nas a result of Defendants' noncompliance that would ultimately result in disenfranchisement \nbecause she would not be able to vote in her home precinct in the March 2020 primary election if \nher registration was not updated before February 3, 2020. Docket no. 5-1, Appx. 185-186. \nAt the same time, Defendants admitted that their practices had not changed. See docket \nno. 57 Tr. at 5:20-23 (\"I don't think that the facts have changed materially or relevantly since \nStringer one and I think a[s] they've laid them out overall we don't have an objection to their \ncharacterization of the process.\"); 58:19-21 (\"There have been no material changes with our \npractices with respect to online driver's license renewal and DPS.\"); 59:5-6 (\"The practices and \nlaw hasn't changed.\"). Moreover, despite any repeated or recurring injury to Plaintiffs, \nDefendants have insisted, at various stages of this litigation, that changes to come into \ncompliance with the NVRA would take too long. Thus, according to Defendants, Plaintiffs \nwould just need to figure out another way to get registered to vote. See docket no 46, pp. 9-10. \nAfter reviewing the evidence, the Court entered its first order granting emergency relief to \nthe individual plaintiffs, and abated the rest, to ensure that Stringer, Harms, and Gomez would be \n8 \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 97   Filed 08/28/20   Page 9 of 68\nregistered to vote by the deadline and would not be disenfranchised in the upcoming primary \nelection. However, relying on defense counsel's representations about the length of time it would \ntake to implement corrective measures, the Court fashioned an interim remedy to address the \nmost immediate harm. As the Court explained: \nThe temporary relief being ordered herein is narrowly tailored, and the Court orders no \nmore than what the law clearly and unequivocally requires of Defendants. There is an \nexpectation, under the notice provisions of the NVRA, that if a designated voter \nregistration agency such as DPS violates the NYRA, the chief election official of the \nState  upon notification  will correct the violation. That is all the Court is ordering \nherein. Compliance with this order will ensure that the individual plaintiffs herein will \nnot be forced to suffer a continuing or threatened future injury. \nFor the reasons stated herein, which are based on a preliminary review, the Court \nORDERS that pursuant to 52 U.S.C.  20504(d), the last change of address forms \n§ \nsubmitted by the individual plaintiffs for purposes of updating the address on their \ndriver's license \"shall serve as notification of change of address for voter registration with \nrespect to elections for Federal office for the registrant involved.\" Defendant DPS must \nimmediately submit the information contained in the previously completed forms, along \nwith the individual plaintiffs' stored electronic signatures, as necessary, to the Texas \nSecretary of State. The Secretary of State will then immediately submit the same \ninformation to the correct county voter registrars, along with a copy of this injunction \norder and written instructions to immediately register these individual plaintiffs to vote. \nThe Secretary of State must confirm that all three individual plaintiffs are registered to \nvote before the deadline to register to vote so they may participate in the upcoming \nprimary elections. When that confirmation is received, Defendants must file a written \nadvisory with the Court no later than 2:00 p.m. on February 3 confirming that all three \nindividual plaintiffs are timely registered to vote in the county and precinct in which they \nreside. If Defendants must designate one or more employees, agents, or representatives to \ncarry out this order, they are expected to do so. \nDocket no. 46, pp. 16-17. Defendants complied with the court-ordered relief, reporting back to \nthe Court as follows: \nDefendants received the Court's order on the afternoon of January 30, 2020. DPS \nimmediately began taking steps to ensure compliance. DPS collected the information \ncontained in the individual plaintiffs' driver record from their previously completed \nchange-of-address transactions, and such information was delivered to SOS on the \nmorning of January 31, 2020. Likewise, upon receipt of the Court's order, SOS \nimmediately began taking steps to ensure compliance. The information received from \nDPS was submitted to the correct county voter registrars, along with a copy of the Court's \ninjunction order and written instructions to immediately register the individual plaintiffs \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 97   Filed 08/28/20   Page 10 of 68\nto vote, as specified in the order. On January 31, 2020, the county voter registrars \nconfirmed to SOS that the individual plaintiffs had been registered to vote before the \ndeadline to register to vote so they may participate in the upcoming primary elections. \nAdditionally, on February 2, 2020, SOS verified in the State's voter registration system \nthat the individual voters were actively registered to vote at their new addresses. \nAccordingly, Defendants advise the Court that all three individual plaintiffs are timely \nregistered to vote in the county and precinct in which they reside. \nDocket no. 48. Defendants did not seek an interlocutory appeal of the first order, which fell short \nof ordering full compliance with the NVRA due to time restraints but ensured that the individual \nplaintiffs would not be disenfranchised. After giving the parties additional time to conduct \ndiscovery and submit supplemental briefing, the Court now addresses the remainder of the \npending motion for preliminary \ninjunction.2 \nIII. \nStandard and process of review \nTo obtain a preliminary injunction, movants must establish each of the following four \nfactors: \n(1) a substantial likelihood of success on the merits; \n(2) a substantial threat of irreparable injury if the injunction is not issued; \n(3) the threatened injury if the injunction is denied outweighs any harm that will result if \nthe injunction is granted; and \n(4) granting an injunction will not disserve the public interest. \nTexas v.  United States, 809 F.3d 134, 150 (5th Cir. 2015). In many cases, a preliminary \ninjunction serves  to preserve the relative positions of the parties until a trial on the merits can be \nheld. Univ. of Texas v. Camenisch, 451 U.S. 390, 395 (1981). Preliminary injunctions that would \n2Because the DPS Sytem has not changed since Stringer I, the recent discovery focused on \nstanding and the length of time it would take for Defendants to make the necessary changes to come into \ncompliance with the NVRA. \n10 \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 97   Filed 08/28/20   Page 11 of 68\nchange, rather than maintain, the status quo are generally disfavored and should not issue unless \nthe facts and law clearly favor the moving party. Martinez v. Mathews, 544 F.2d 1233, 1243 (5th \nCir. 1976). On the other hand, \"[a] fundamental principle of preliminary injunctions [is that] [a]n \ninjunction is of no help if one must wait to suffer injury before the court grants it.\" Texas v.  US., \n809 F.3d at 173 n. 137 (citing Un ited States v. Emerson, 270 F.3d 203, 262 (5th Cir. 2001)). \nDenying injunctive relief and maintaining the status quo at this juncture of these proceedings \nwould mean that Mr. Stringer would remain unregistered and ineligible to vote in the precinct \nwhere he resides while violations of the NVRA continue unabated.3 The Court need not wait for \nMr. Stringer to suffer further injury before considering preliminary injunctive relief. Id. Given \nthe limited purpose of a preliminary injunction, and given the haste that is often necessary in \nconsidering the relief being sought, \"a preliminary injunction is customarily granted on the basis \nof procedures that are less formal and evidence that is less complete than in a trial on the merits.\" \nCamenisch, 451 U.S. at 395. Ultimately, the decision to grant preliminary injunctive relief rests \nin the sound discretion of the district court, and is \"often dependent as much on the equities of \n[the] case as the substance of the legal issues it presents.\" Trump v. Int'l Refugee Assistance \n-, -, \nProject,  U.S.  137 S.Ct. 2080, 2087 (2017). \nIv. \nArticle III standing \nAgain, as they have claimed at every stage of the proceedings in both Stringer I and \nStringer II, Defendants claim none of the Plaintiffs or Intervenor-Plaintiffs have standing to seek \n3As explained infra, the Court's focuses on Mr. Stringer's injuries because it has not yet \ndetermined the standing of all Plaintiffs and Intervenor-Plaintiffs and Mr. Stringer's standing to seek \npreliminary injunctive relief is indisputable. \n11 \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 97   Filed 08/28/20   Page 12 of 68\ninjunctive \nrelief.4 \nIn a lawsuit for injunctive relief, the presence of one party with standing is sufficient to \nsatisf  Article III's case or controversy requirement. Rumsfield v. Forum for Acad. & \nInstitutional Rights, Inc., 547 U.S. 47, 52 n. 2 (2006); Texas v.  United States, 945 F.3d 355, 377- \n378 (5th Cir. 2020). Moreover, \"the injury alleged as an Article III injury-in-fact need not be \n... \nsubstantial; it need not measure more than an 'identifiable trifle,'  [t]his is because the \n[requirement] under Article III is qualitative, not quantitative, in nature.\" OCA-Greater Houston \nv.  Texas, 867 F.3d 604, 612 (5th Cir. 2017) (citing Ass 'n of Cmty Orgs. For Reform Now v. \nFlowler, 178 F.3d 350, 358 (5th Cir. 1999)). \nTo establish standing under Article III, a plaintiff must demonstrate (1) that he or she \nsuffered an injury in fact that is concrete, particularized, and actual or imminent, (2) that the \ninjury was caused by the defendant, and (3) that the injury would likely be redressed by the \n-, \nrequested judicial relief. Thole v.  US. Bank NA.,  U.S.  140 S.Ct. 1615, 1618 (2020); \nFriends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Environmental Services, 528 U.S. 167, 180-8 1  (2000); \nLujan v. Defenders of Wild! ife, 504 U.S. 555, 560-61, 112 S.Ct. 2130 (1992). Standing is to be \ndetermined as of the commencement of suit. Lujan, 504 U.S. at 570 n. 5. In this case, the Court \nhas already determined that the individual plaintiffs have Article III standing, as reflected in its \norder entered January 30th granting partial preliminary injunctive relief (docket no. 46). As the \nCourt explained: \nIt is undisputed that Plaintiffs Stringer, Gomez, and Harms were not simultaneously \nregistered to vote (i.e., their voter registration was not updated) at the time of their online \ntransactions with DPS, a designated voter registration agency. It is undisputed that they \nare still unregistered to vote and will be disenfranchised on March 3 if they are not \nregistered to vote by the deadline  February 3. This continuing injury (lack of voter \n4Unlike Stringer I, Defendants have not raised immunity and mootness defenses. They only \nchallenge Article III standing. \n12 \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 97   Filed 08/28/20   Page 13 of 68\nregistration as a result of Defendants' unlawful procedure) and threatened future injury \n(disenfranchisement) more than satisfies the standing necessary for injunctive relief. See \nStringer v.  Whitley, 942 F.3d at 720 (\"plaintiffs seeking injunctive []relief can satisfy the \nredressability requirement only by demonstrating a continuing injury or threatened future \ninjury.\"). The Plaintiffs' continuing and threatened future injury will be (1) potentially \nsuffered by these plaintiffs, not someone else; (2) \"concrete and particularized,\" not \nabstract; and (3) \"actual or imminent, not 'conjectural' or 'hypothetical.\" Id. at 720-21. \nWith the deadline for voter registration in just a few days, and the primary election thirty \ndays thereafter, there is a \"substantial risk\" that the individual plaintiffs will be \ndisenfranchised if they are not registered to vote; thus, threatened future injury is \nindisputably \"imminent.\" Moreover, Plaintiffs' continuing and future threatened injury is \n\"fairly traceable\" to the challenged action of Defendants. But for Defendants failure to \ncomply with the NVRA, and the unjustified burden on Plaintiffs' constitutional rights, \nPlaintiffs would already be registered to vote in the county and precinct where they \nreside. \nThe future injury  disenfranchisement  is irreparable. The right to vote is a fundamental \nright, and the deprivation of such right is something Plaintiffs \"will never be able to \nrecover.\" Stringer v.  Whitley, 942 F.3d at 726. (Ho, J., concurring). But the injury that \nwill occur between now and March 3 is still redressable with immediate, temporary \ninjunctive relief. These individual plaintiffs should not be forced to wait and suffer a \nconstitutional deprivation when it can be avoided by granting temporary injunctive relief. \nTexas v.  US., 809 F.3d at 173 n. 137 (citing United States v. Emerson, 270 F.3d 203, 262 \n(5th Cir. 2001)). \nDocket no. 46, pp. 14-15. \nThus, the question becomes whether anything has changed. After determining that the \nindividual plaintiffs had standing, the Court ordered the Secretary to register the individual \nplaintiffs to vote to avoid disenfranchisement in the primary election. Docket no. 46. The \nSecretary complied with the court-ordered temporary relief and as a result \"all three individual \nplaintiffs [were] timely registered to vote in the county and precinct in which they reside.\" \nDocket no. 48. Ironically, the individual plaintiffs were registered to vote solely as a result of a \ncourt order, rather than any voluntary action by the Secretary, yet Defendant now claims the \nindividual plaintiffs lack standing because they are registered to vote. Docket no. 74, p. 5 (\"all \nthree Individual Plaintiffs are now registered to vote. Accordingly, each Individual Plaintiff \nshould be dismissed from this litigation for lack of standing.\"). Even more ironically, the court- \n13 \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 97   Filed 08/28/20   Page 14 of 68\nordered voter registration was a temporary measure out of deference to Defendants who \nrepresented to the Court at the time of the injunction hearing that full compliance with the NVRA \nwould be impossible to achieve before the voter registration deadline on February 3, 2020. See \ndocket nos. 36, 46, 47. \nThere are notable deficiencies with Defendants' challenge to the individual plaintiffs' \nstanding at this stage of the proceedings. First, Defendants cite no authority for the proposition \nthat plaintiffs who have standing when a lawsuit is initiated and at the time of court-ordered \ninterim relief are thereafter divested of standing as a result of court-ordered interim  In \nrelief.5 \nvoting rights cases, interim injunctive relief is often necessary because litigation may last longer \nthan an election cycle. But interim relief is not final relief, and if interim relief divested plaintiffs \nof standing, many voting rights cases would abruptly end before the Court could ever reach the \nmerits or consider the ultimate relief being sought. In this case, compliance with the NVRA and \nthe Equal Protection clause is the ultimate relief being sought. The court-ordered interim relief in \nJanuary merely accomplished the manual task of getting the individual plaintiffs registered to \nvote by alternative means. But getting the individual plaintiffs registered to vote to avoid \nimminent disenfranchisement by no means addressed the ultimate relief being sought in this \nlawsuit. \nSecond, Defendants seem to conflate standing with mootness, but they make no argument \nthat the court-ordered interim relief rendered all of the individual plaintiffs' claims moot. Even \nvoluntary cessation of a challenged conduct does not ordinarily render a case or controversy moot \n5Almost the entire focus of Defendants' post-discovery brief (docket no. 74) is on standing. \nDefendants have never disputed the facts. Approximately one page in Defendants' brief is devoted to the \nstanding of the individual plaintiffs, and the only authority cited is Stringer I. But the Stringer I plaintiffs' \nlack of standing, as determined by the Fifth Circuit, does not dictate the standing of the individual \nplaintiffs in this case, which must be based on current facts and circumstances. \n14 \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 97   Filed 08/28/20   Page 15 of 68\nand there has been no voluntary cessation in this case as Defendants have failed to come into \ncompliance with the NYRA. As this Court noted in Stringer I, voting-related lawsuits do not \nbecome moot just because an election has passed. Ctr. for mdiv. Freedom v. Carmouche, 449 \nF.3d 655, 662 (5th Cir. 2006) (\"Controversy surrounding elections laws.  is one of the \n.  . \nparadigmatic circumstances in which the Supreme Court has found that full litigation can never \nbe completed before the precise controversy (a particular election) has run its course.\"). Although \nthe Fifth Circuit touched on the issue of mootness in Stringer I, the issue was never reached \nbecause the Court determined that the Stringer I plaintiffs lacked standing at the time the lawsuit \nwas initiated. Stringer v.  Whitley, 942 F.3d at 724. The circumstances for all three individual \nStringer II plaintiffs are different because they did have standing when this lawsuit was initiated \nand they had standing when the Court issued its first order granting injunctive relief. Even if \nmootness is now implicated for the claims of Mr. Harms and Ms. Gomez, Mr. Stringer's \ncircumstances have shown that this is exactly the type of violation that is capable of repetition yet \nevading review. See Spencer v. Kemna, 523 U.S. 1, 17-18 (1998) (the doctrine applies when the \nchallenged action is in its duration too short to be fully litigated prior to cessation or expiration \nand there is a reasonable expectation that the same complaining party will be subject to the same \naction again). Defendants have thus far refused to change their online process to allow \nsimultaneous voter registration applications. And now, the same injury is likely to occur again. \nWhen a controversy is truly moot, there is nothing left to remedy. In this case, Defendants' \nnoncompliance with the NVRA has continued unabated, and the challenged action continues. \nAlthough they do not couch their argument in terms of mootness, Defendants claim that \nbecause they complied with the Court's January order and registered the individual plaintiffs to \nvote, none of the individual plaintiffs have a claim and their lawsuit should be dismissed. But \n15 \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 97   Filed 08/28/20   Page 16 of 68\nDefendants were simply being ordered by the Court to cany out the duties that federal law \nrequires of them. See 52 U.S.C.  20506 (a)(4)(A),(6)(C) (A voter registration agency shall \n§ \nprovide assistance to each applicant in completing voter registration forms unless the applicant \nrefuses such assistance). Again, the underlying violations that form the basis of the complaint \nhave not been corrected and continue unabated. The DPS online renewal and change of address \ntransactions do not serve as \"simultaneous\" applications for voter registration, in violation of 52 \nu.s.c. §  20503(a)(l), 20504(a)(1); the separate SOS voter registration process is not \"part of' \nthe DPS online driver's license transaction, as required by 52 U. S.C.  20504(c)( 1); information \n§ \nrequired by SOS for a separate voter registration transaction \"duplicates\" the information \nrequired by DPS for an online renewal or change of address transaction, in violation of 52 U.S.C. \n20504(c)(2)(A); and the online change of address transaction does not \"serve as notification of \n§ \nchange of address for voter registration,\" as required by 52 U.S.C. § 20504(d).6 \nDefendants' argument also overlooks the true nature of the Plaintiffs' cause of action. \nPlaintiffs are claiming that the State's process is itself unlawful and violates their federal right to \n\"[s}imultaneous application for voter registration and  ..  driver's license[.]\" 52 U.S.C.  20504. \n.  § \nThis cause of action remains cognizable regardless of whether the individual plaintiffs have been \nregistered to vote by alternative means and pursuant to court order. See Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins, \n136 S.Ct. 1540, 1549 (2016), as revised (May 24, 2016) (\"Congress has the power to define \ninjuries and articulate chains of causation that will give rise to a case or controversy where none \n6The mandates of the NVRA dictate exactly the opposite of what Defendants want Texans to do \nto personally ensure they are registered to vote: engage in a second transaction that requires a separate \napplication with duplicate information and the burden of downloading, printing, and mailing or personal \ndelivery. Congress lifted these burdens to make voter registration easier, yet Defendants have ignored the \nNVRA mandate and impose requirements which result in disenfranchisement if voters do not jump \nthrough all the hoops. \n16 \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 97   Filed 08/28/20   Page 17 of 68\nexisted before.\"); Wendt v. 24 Hour Fitness USA, Inc., 821 F.3d 547, 552 (5th Cir. 2016) (\"{t]he \nactual or threatened injury required by Art.

Fowler, 178 F.3d 350, 363 (5th Cir. \n1999) (the NVRA' s private right of action \"extend[s] standing under the Act to the maximum \nallowable under the Constitution\"); Arcia v. Florida Sec 'y of State, 772 F.3d 1335, 1341 (11th \nCir. 2014) (\"Even though they were ultimately not prevented from voting, an injury like theirs \n[being erroneously identified as a non-citizen and removed from the voter rolls] is sufficient to \nconfer standing.\"); Common Cause/Georgia v. Billups, 554 F.3d 1340, 1351 (11th Cir. 2009) (\"A \nplaintiff need not have the franchise wholly denied to suffer injury.\"). \nFinally, and perhaps most importantly, even if Mr. Harms and Ms. Gomez received all the \nrelief to which they were entitled in this Court's interim order (because they were registered to \nvote) and, as Defendants suggest, they were subsequently \"divested of standing\" to pursue any \nfurther relief (compliance with the NVRA and the Equal Protection clause), only one plaintiff \nmust have Article III standing for the Court to consider injunctive relief. The record clearly \nindicates that Mr. Stringer had standing when this lawsuit was initiated; he had standing at the \ntime the Court entered interim relief in January; and Mr. Stringer continues to have standing \ntoday. \nIn Stringer I, the Fifth Circuit determined that Mr. Stringer lacked standing because \nalthough he was not registered to vote when he used the noncompliant driver's license services, \nhe \"became registered prior to bringing [the] lawsuit\" and he failed to show that his injury was \ncontinuing or that he faced a threat of future injury. Stringer v.  Whitley, 942 F.3d at 724. To show \na threat of future injury, the Court explained, Stringer must demonstrate \"a sufficient probability \nthat [he] will use the noncompliant driver's license services again.\" Id.  at 722. For example, \n17 \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 97   Filed 08/28/20   Page 18 of 68\nStringer \"will have the occasion to use the DPS System to update his voter registration.  if he \n.  . \nmoves within Texas, in which case he might wish [to] use the DPS System to change his address \non file with DPS and his county voter registrar.  .\". Id. \n. \nAlthough the Fifth Circuit found that Mr. Stringer had not shown he would move again \nand use the DPS System to change his address and update his voter registration again, the \nevidence now shows that it did happen again. In late 2019, Mr. Stringer moved from his \nresidence in Bexar County to a new residence in Harris County. On November 23, 2019, he used \nthe DPS System to change the address on his driver's license. He would have simultaneously \nupdated his voter registration, but was not given the option. Thus, unlike the circumstances in \nStringer I, Mr. Stringer was unregistered to vote in Harris County when this lawsuit was flied. He \nclearly had standing when suit was initiated. Docket no. 1; Docket no. 5-1, appx. 178-180. \nSoon after suit was filed, Plaintiffs again sought preliminary injunctive relief. Docket no. \n5. Because  Mr. Stringer was suffering a second injury as the result of Defendants' \nnoncompliance with the NVRA, and he would not be able to vote in the March 2020 primary \nelection in the county and precinct where he resided, the Court ordered that Mr. Stringer's voter \nregistration be updated before February 3, 2020. Docket no. 46. Defendants complied with the \nCourt's order and manually updated Mr. Stringer's voter registration so he could vote in the \nprimary election. Docket no. 48. However, the court-ordered voter registration did not \"divest\" \nMr. Stringer of standing to pursue future injunctive relief, or render his claims moot, because he \nhad concrete plans to move again in August 2020 and would once again use the DPS System to \nchange his address and update his voter registration. Docket no. 5-1, appx. 178-180; docket no. \n69-1, pp. 72, 74 (Deposition of J. Stringer at 35:6-15, 37:1-4); docket no. 91, exh. A. \n18 \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 97   Filed 08/28/20   Page 19 of 68\nThose plans have now come to fruition. Mr. Stringer moved to a new residence on \nAugust 15, 2020, and he fully intends to use the DPS System to again change his address and \nsimultaneously update his voter registration. Docket no. 96. Thus, absent injunctive relief, Mr. \nStringer will have his rights violated a third time. Applying the standard set forth in Stringer I, \nthe uncontested facts in the record clearly demonstrate \"a sufficient probability that [Mr. \nStringer] will use the noncompliant driver's license services again\" and there is a \"substantial \nrisk\" that he will be injured by his inability to simultaneously register to vote as required by the \nNVRA. There is also a \"substantial risk\" that Mr. Stringer will be disenfranchised in the general \nelection if injunctive relief is not ordered.7 \nAgain, the NVRA's private right of action \"extend[s] standing under the Act to the \nmaximum allowable under the Constitution.\" ACORNv. Fowler, 178 F.3d at 363. The presence \nof one party with standing is sufficient to satisfi Article III. Rumsfeld v. Forum for Academic & \nInstitutional Rights, 547 U.S. at 52 n. 2; Texas v.  US., 787 F.3d at 747. And a threat of \nimpending injury is sufficient to satisfy Article III standing. See Wendt, 821 F.3 d at 552 (\"[t]he \nactual or threatened injury required by Art. III may exist solely by virtue of statutes creating legal \nrights, the invasion of which creates standing\"). Here, Mr. Stringer has presented undisputed \nevidence of not only past violations but an imminent threat of future injury. Despite the NVRA \nbeing in existence for almost thirty years, and Defendants' knowledge that they are not in \ncompliance with the NYRA, Defendants have failed to take the necessary steps to cure ongoing \nstatutory violations and come into compliance. The immediate threat of additional injury to Mr. \nStringer continues because Defendants have not altered their practices. \n7As Mr. Stringer has noted in his recent sworn declaration, he currently resides in a different \ncongressional district than the district in which he resided when this lawsuit was initiated. Docket no. 96. \n19 \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 97   Filed 08/28/20   Page 20 of 68\nBecause the Court finds that Mr. Stringer has standing to seek injunctive relief, and the \ninjunctive relief he seeks is the same relief sought by the organizational plaintiffs and intervenor- \nplaintiffs, the Court finds it unnecessary at this juncture to determine the standing of each \norganization to seek injunctive relief 8 \nSubstantial likelihood of success on the merits \nThe Court has twice addressed the merits of the claims, and incorporates those findings \nherein. At the risk of repetition, the Court restates the facts, which are based on the Stringer I \nrecord as well as the record submitted by the parties herein. \nA.  How the DPS System works \nAs previously explained, each of Mr. Stringer's personal, experiences with DPS 's online \nprocess are consistent with the testimony of State officials and employees with knowledge of \nhow the process worked in the past and how it currently works. DPS operates offices around the \nState and issues driver's licenses and other state identification cards. DPS is also a designated \nvoter registration agency, pursuant to 52 U.S.C.  20506. DPS's in-person driver's license \n§ \napplications (DL-14A),9 in-person renewal/replacement/change of address forms (DL-43),'° and \nmail-in change of address forms (DL-64)\" currently serve as simultaneous voter registration \n81f the Court did not face time restraints, it would address the standing of each organization. \nHowever, given the calendar days remaining before the voter registration deadline, it is in the best \ninterest of the parties to simply address the standing of Mr. Stringer at this juncture. \n9Stringer I docket no. 93, exh.

The form will also inform the applicant that the applicant's \n.  . \nelectronic signature provided to the department will be used for submitting the applicant's voter \nregistration application.\" Stringer I docket no  77, appx. 30 (emphasis added).'4 The \nimplementation plan further states that the \"department will use a change of address form and \nprocedure that combines department and voter registration functions. The change of address form \nsubmitted in person will allow a licensee or cardholder to indicate whether the change of address \nis also to be used for registration purposes.\" Id. (emphasis added). On \"[e]ach weekday the \nDepartment is regularly open for business, the Department will electronically transfer to the \nSecretary of State (SOS) the name and relevant data regarding each applicant who is of voting \n12Until May 2015, DL-64 did not include any question about whether the applicant wanted to \nregister to vote. Stringer I docket no. 77, appx. 116 (admission no. 21). \n'3The process for driver's license change of address and renewal is \"combined online  it's one \nsystem interface.\"  Stringer I docket no. 94-12, deposition of S. Gipson, at 37:10-16; docket no. 77, appx. \n117, admission no. 5 (\"the [Texas.gov] website provides a single online process for qualified applicants \nto renew their driver's license, update the address listed on their driver's license, or complete both \nprocesses in a single online transaction\"). But voter registration is a completely separate transaction that \nmust be done through SOS. Stringer I docket no. 94-12, deposition of S. Gipson, at 78:1-9; 94:1-4; see \nalso Stringer I docket no. 77, appx. 118 (admission nos. 10, 11). \n'4The form states: \"By providing my electronic signature, I understand the personal information \non my application form and my electronic signature will be used for submitting my voter's registration \napplication to the Texas Secretary of State's office. Wanting to register to vote, I authorize the \nDepartment of Public Safety to transfer this information to the Texas Secretary of State.\" Stringer I \ndocket no. 77, appx. 40, deposition of K. Ingram (SOS) at 62:18-63:1. \n21 \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 97   Filed 08/28/20   Page 22 of 68\nage and a United States citizen who affirmatively answered the voter registration question.\" \nStringer I docket no. 77, appx. 31 (emphasis added). This plan was implemented after the \nenactment of the NVRA and confirms Texas's understanding that the driver's license/voter \nregistration process must be \"combined\" in one simultaneous transaction and that electronic \nsignatures would be used for voter registration purposes. \nWhen an individual applies for a Texas driver's license the first time, he must appear in \nperson. During the transaction he signs a key pad which captures his electronic signature.15 After \na driver's license is issued, subsequent transactions (for renewal, replacement, or change of \naddress) may be handled by mail, online, or even by phone. For voter registration purposes, the \nchange of address forms submitted by mail have been handled in the same manner as \nrenewal/change of address forms submitted in person. In both form DL-43 (the in-person \napplication for renewal/replacement/change of address) and form DL-64 (the mail-in application \nfor change of address) the driver's license and voter registration applications have been \nintegrated or combined into one simultaneous transaction so that a customer need only check a \nsingle box indicating that he/she would like to register or update his/her voter information. After \nchecking the box during the transaction, no further steps are necessary.16 DPS receives the \ninformation and the individual's previously stored electronic signature, along with all other \nidentifying data, is electronically submitted to SOS to be used for voter registration purposes)7 \n'5See Stringer I docket no. 94-8, deposition of S. Gipson (DPS), at 234:11-24. \n16j  other words, there is no need to go to SOS to obtain, print, complete, sign, and mail a \nseparate voter registration application. \n17Stringer I docket no. 94-7, deposition of Betsy Schonhoff, SOS voter registration manager, at \n28:3-4 (\"We get application files from them on a daily basis for voter registration\"); Stringer I docket no. \n77, appx. 117, RFA 26 (\"Admits that the information DPS transmits to SOS about each applicant for \nvoter registration includes a digital image of the applicant's signature\"). \n22 \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 97   Filed 08/28/20   Page 23 of 68\nUpon receipt, the SOS then transmits the data to local registrars for completion of the voter \nregistration process.'8 Although the in-person and mail-in renewal/change of address forms \ncontain a blank for a signature, neither DPS nor SOS use the signature on paper. 19 Instead, DPS \nand SOS use the previously stored electronic signature.2° In fact, SOS admits that it never uses \npaper signatures obtained through DPS transactions  it uses only previously imaged electronic \nsignatures for voter registration purposes.2' As Keith Ingram, the SOS 30(b)(6) representative, \n'8As B. Schonhoff further explained: \nQ: So DLS is the diver's license system, correct? \nA: That's what I understand, right. \nQ: And how does that system function within that process, the transfer process? \nA: It's my understanding that when the operator enters an application into the DLS system and \nindicates that a person wants to be a registered voter, that information is then warehoused, if you \nwill, at the State, and every night the State groups up those applications and send them  well, we \nget them as a single file. So depending on  for the DPS applications, I think we actually go pull \nthey produce the file, and then we go pull it and process it through our system on a daily basis. \nQ: What do you mean by \"our system\"? \nA: I'm sorry, the voter registration system, the team database system where we actually part the \naddresses and give that information out to the voter registrars of the county. \n(Stringer I docket no. 94-7, deposition of B. Schonhoff, at 68:1-20). \n'9See Stringer I docket no. 94-8, deposition of S.

It's used for the signature that's required in the \nTexas Election Code. You read me the section. Is that right? \nA: That's right. \nQ: What's the ink signature on the DPS's physical forms used for as far as voter \nregistration? \nA: I don't know. I don't know if it's used for anything. Once they've applied in person at \nthe office, they've signed it electronically. \n*  *  * \nQ: On the. .  . driver's license forms. .  .  it says, \"By providing my electronic signature, I \nunderstand the personal information on my application form and my electronic signature \nwill be used for submitting my voter registration application to the Secretary of State's \nOffice.\" Correct? \nA: That's what it says. \nQ. Okay. And so that's indicating to the prospective voter that the electronic signature is \nwhat's used as the signature that's compliant with the Texas Election Code? \nA: The physical signature that's electronically captured, yes. \nQ: Okay. Back to your point about the online transactions not containing a signature, the \nDPS does use the prior provided electronic signature that  for the driver's license that \nthey  the customer used  provided the last time they were in person. Correct? \nA: Presumably, yes. \nQ: The same goes for the mail-in change of address transaction  are you looking at your \ndriver's license there? \n24 \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 97   Filed 08/28/20   Page 25 of 68\nA: Yeah. Because this one was renewed online, and so I guess that I wrote that signature \nat their signature capture device quite a while ago... \nQ: For the mail-in change of address form that.  DPS receives that has the voter \n.  . \nregistration question, there is not an electronic signature or a  use your phrase  the \nphysical signature provided on a keypad provided for that change of address interaction. \nCorrect? \nA: No. There's a physical signature on the  on the address change application. \nQ: Right. But the information that gets sent on to the voter registrars through the \nSecretary of State's Office is the data that's pulled from that form and then the electronic \nsignature that was previously provided by the customer in person at a DPS office? \nA: That's my understanding, yes. \nQ: Well, is that the Secretary of State's understanding? \nA: That is the Secretary of State's understanding. You bet. \nStringer I docket no. 94-il, appx. 39, 42, deposition of K. Ingram, at 50:1-11; 95:14-97:14. \nSheri Gipson with DPS also testified: \nQ: So the signature that is sent for an in-person transaction where someone answers \"yes\" \nto the voter registration question and  and similarly when someone changes their address \nexcuse me  address via the mail, the signature that's sent for both of those voter \nregistration applications, that's the electronic signature; is that right? \nA: That is correct. \nQ: And that's sent to the Secretary of State? \nA: That is correct. \nQ: Okay. The ink signature is never sent to the Secretary of State, correct? \nA: That is correct. \n25 \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 97   Filed 08/28/20   Page 26 of 68\n*  *  * \nQ: Does anyone go through and compare these two? \nno.... \nA: Not typically, \n*  *  * \nQ: Okay. So then the mail-in signatures are never compared [with the stored electronic \nsignatures]. \nA: During the routine process, it would never be compared.  When I say \"routine \n.  .  . \nprocess,\" what I'm talking about is the individual that's processing that mail renewal \napplication, they would never compare that signature. \nStringer I docket no. 77, appx. 69, deposition of S. Gipson, at 203:19-204:7; appx. 79 at 234:25- \n235:1; 236:19-237:9. \nBecause preexisting electronic signatures, rather than signatures on paper, are used for \npaper (in-person and mail-in) renewal and change of address transactions, it would seem logical \nthat preexisting electronic signatures would be used for paperless (online) transactions. Yet \nDefendants claim that, under Texas law, renewal and change of address transactions performed \nonline require a signature on paper for voter registration purposes. As Mr. Ingram testified: \nQ: So in that same way, the online transaction could utilize the previously provided \nelectronic signature that was provided in person by the customer for the voter registration \napplication form that gets to the voter registrar in the same way that the change of address \nmail-in occurs? \nA: It could if the law allowed it, but the law doesn't allow it, so it can't. \nQ: What portion of the [Texas] law doesn't allow it? \nA: 13.002(b). \nStringer I docket no. 94-11, deposition of K. Ingram, at 97:15-24; Stringer I docket no. 77, appx. \n26 \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 97   Filed 08/28/20   Page 27 of 68\n42. Because Defendants assert that Texas law requires a signature on paper, and a signature on \npaper during a paperless transaction is not possible, Defendants essentially claim they should be \nexcused from compliance with the NVRA when it comes to online renewal and change of \naddress \ntransactions.22 \nPrior to 2013, a person who engaged in an online/paperless transaction for a driver's \nlicense renewal or change of address would provide the same in-depth identifying information \nrequired for an in-person or mail-in transaction, but when reaching the question of whether he \nwould like to register to vote or update his voter information, checking the \"yes\" box would \nautomatically default to \"no.\" Thus, while the user may have been led to believe that his \"yes\" \nanswer would result in updating his voter information, and there was the appearance of \ncompliance with the NVRA, there was never an intent on the part of DPS or SOS to actually \nupdate the voter registration information. Thus, the answer to the question regarding voter \nregistration was completely meaningless. SOS was aware of the NVRA requirements. SOS was \nalso aware that the online voter registration question, programmed to automatically default to \n\"no,\" was completely meaningless.23 As Mr. Ingram testified: \nQ: Why is there a voter registration question on the online DPS transaction  application? \nExcuse me. \nA: Well, I imagine it's because of Section 5 of the National Voter Registration Act of \n1993. \n22As Ms. Gipson explained, for online transactions, Texas has decided that a previously captured \nelectronic signature is sufficient for driver's license purposes, but they've refused to accept the same \nelectronic signature for voter registration purposes. Stringer I docket no. 77, appx. 70, deposition of S. \nGipson, at 215:21-216:7. \n230r worse, it could have led to voter registration data being purged. Legislative history suggests \nthat a key concern when enacting the NVRA was abuse of the purging efforts, so Congress specifically \nprevented states from removing voters from the rolls for failure to vote or failure to respond to a change- \nof-address notification. See H.R. Rep. No. 103-9, at 16 (1993), reprinted in 1993 U.S.C.C.A.N. 105, 120. \n27 \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 97   Filed 08/28/20   Page 28 of 68\nQ: Could you elaborate on that a little bit? \nA: Sure. The National Voter Registration Act of 1993 required that motor vehicle \nagencies, in our case the DPS, whenever a person has a driver's license transaction \ndriver's license transaction, that they should simultaneously offer the right  the ability to \nupdate their voter registration or register to vote for the first time. That's why the NVRA \nis called the Motor Voter law. \n*  *  * \nQ: Okay. So in  back in 2012, the Secretary of State's office was aware that the answer \nto the \"do you want to register to vote\" question online was defaulting to no. Is that \ncorrect? \nA: Right. \nQ: Was there any  any discussion at that point with the Department of Public Safety to \nto make that change? \nA: Not that I recall. \nStringer I docket no. 77, appx. 40-4 1, deposition of K. Ingram at 62:4-17; 84:24-85:8. \nAs explained in Mr. Ingram's deposition, the automatic default to \"no\" for voter \nregistration was the subject of a 2012 complaint by an unidentified motor voter. Stringer I docket \nno. 77, appx. 41, deposition of K. Ingram at 83:15-85:3. SOS responded: \"That is something we \ncan discuss with DPS in the future.\" Stringer I docket no. 77, appx. 41, deposition of K. Ingram \nat 84:16-18. Mr. Ingram did not recall any subsequent discussions. After some passage of time, \nDPS did remove the automatic default to \"no.\" Stringer I docket no. 77, appx. 41, deposition of \nK. Ingram at 82:7-13. \nThereafter, until February 27, 2016, Step 5 of the online renewal and change of address \ninterface was changed to prompt the applicant to select \"yes\" or \"no\" beneath the statement \"I \n28 \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 97   Filed 08/28/20   Page 29 of 68\nwant to register to vote.\" It no longer defaulted to \"no,\" but selecting \"yes\" did not provide a \nsimultaneous voter application. Instead, it gave the user a link to the SOS voter registration \nwebsite for a completely separate application process. Stringer I docket no. 77, appx. 118, \nadmission no. 7. \nAfter February 27, 2016, Step 5 of the online renewal and change of address interface was \nchanged to prompt the applicant to select \"yes\" or \"no\" to answer the question \"Do you want to \nrequest a voter application?\" Stringer I docket no. 77, appx. 118, admission 8, 9. While the \nonline process currently accepts a \"yes\" answer to the voter application  question, the transaction \nstill ends there. The user is still not provided a simultaneous application for voter registration \npurposes. Instead, when a user responds with a \"yes\" answer to the voter application question, \nthe user is simply given a website link to the SOS office.24 See Stringer I Stipulation no. 10. If the \nuser goes to the SOS website, he must request and fill out a completely separate voter registration \napplication as if there had been no DPS transaction at  For an in-county change of address, \nall.25 \nSOS will handle the transaction but it is still a completely separate process from the DPS \ntransaction. For an out-of-county change of address, the application must be retrieved, printed, \nfilled out, and mailed or delivered in person to the county registrar in order to update the voter \nregistration. The application seeks the same information required by DPS for an online driver's \nlicense change of address but the applicant must go through a completely different governmental \nentity (SOS) with a completely separate application process.26 Thus, it is indisputable that the \n24See Stringer I docket no. 77, appx. 45, deposition of K. Ingram at 182:5-10 (\"When they select \nyes to voter reg online, they are merely presented with a link and has no indication of whether or not they \nactually registered to vote\"). \n25See Stringer I docket no. 77, appx. 78, deposition of S. Gipson at 136:20-137:2 1 (the voter \nregistration process \"is separate\"). \n26See Stringer I docket no. 94-7, deposition of B. Schonhoff (SOS), at 157:19-158:18 (they would \nhave to fill the same information out twice). \n29 \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 97   Filed 08/28/20   Page 30 of 68\nonline DPS renewal/change of address transaction and SOS voter registration transaction are not \nsimultaneous, but rather entirely separate application procedures conducted through separate \nagencies.27 If an individual does not take these extra steps  go to the SOS website, request an \napplication, print out the application, fill out and sign the application, and then mail or hand \ndeliver it to the country registrar  he will not be registered to vote. \nBoth DPS and SOS claim they cannot comply with the NVRA and integrate DPS online \nrenewal/change of address with SOS voter registration to provide a simultaneous application \nbecause the Texas Election Code requires a signature.

Yet SOS admits that it uses previously stored electronic \nsignatures for all voter registration applications that originate with DPS regardless of whether \nthose applications are paper transactions. As Betsy Schonhoff testified: \nQ: The signature that Secretary of State is currently using for voter registration \napplications is an electronic signature that is provided when a person goes in person to a \nDPS office; is that right? \nA: When they are  when they are in the application file, you mean? \n27See Stringer I docket no. 94-7, deposition of B.

That's my understanding. \nQ: Turning your attention to the mail-in change of address. You acknowledge that the \nSecretary of State does receive voter registration applications from change of address \nmail-ins that DPS processes; is that correct? \nA: That's correct. \nQ: Yes. \nA: It is my understanding they treat in-person just like  mail just the same as in person. \nQ: But the mail-in  correct me if I am wrong  the mail-in address to the application for \nupdate with DPS, the signature that's on that form is not extracted and somehow the \nSecretary of State gets access to it; is that correct? \nA: That's my understanding. \nQ: .  .  . It is your understanding that the current law requires a signature for the voter \nregistration application.  Do I have that right? \nA: Yes. \nQ: The mail-in forms that you all are getting information from, from DPS, uses the prior \nprovided electronic signature from that customer; is that right? \nA: That's my understanding. \nStringer I docket no. 94-7, deposition of B. Schonhoff, at 195:18-196:25. \nDefendants also stipulate that DPS uses electronic signatures for all online driver's \nlicense renewal or change of address transactions. Stringer I docket no. 94, Stipulation 11 (\"The \nsignature that appears on the license generated as a result of a customer's online driver's license \nrenewal or change of address transaction is an image of the applicant's physical signature, \nelectronically captured during the applicant's most recent in-person transaction in a DPS field \n31 \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 97   Filed 08/28/20   Page 32 of 68\noffice (On the DL-14A and DL-43 forms this is referred to as the applicant's 'electronic \nsignature')\"). Defendants admit that they even use electronic signatures for driver's license \ntransactions conducted over the telephone. See Stringer I docket no. 94-12, deposition of S. \nGipson, at 175:2-23 (\"Telephone transactions are handled in the same manner as an online \ntransaction. . .

Hutchins, at 99:22-100:2; Stringer I docket no. 94-10, \ndeposition of J. Crawford, at 142:6-18; 143:12-144:2  (DLS could send all the information it \n1 \ncurrently obtains to the Secretary of State's office, and \"it could also send the previously \nprovided electronic signature from that customer, just like it does with a mail-in change of \naddress\").29 While feasible, Defendants refuse to use the voter information and technology \ncurrently available because they claim the Texas Election Code does not allow the use of \npreviously captured electronic signatures for online transactions  even though they already use \nthem for mail-in and in-person transactions. Plaintiffs disagree with Defendants' legal argument \nand assert that because SOS uses previously captured electronic signatures for voter registration \npurposes in all other instances, there is no reason why Defendants cannot use those same \nelectronic signatures for online transactions. \nB.  The NVRA \nThe NVRA was enacted in 1993 pursuant to Congress's constitutional authority under the \nElections clause to \"make or alter regulations\" which have an effect upon federal elections. U.S. \nCONST. art. 1, § 4, cl. 1. Specifically, Congress found that \n(1)  the right of citizens of the United States to vote is a fundamental right; \n(2)  it is the duty of the Federal, State, and local governments to promote the exercise of \nthat right; and \n(3)  discriminatory and unfair registration laws and procedures can have a direct and \ndamaging effect on voter participation in elections for Federal office and \n29When individuals submit a mail-in a change of address form, a DPS employee manually inputs \nall of the responses into the DLS via computer, including the response to the question of whether he or \nshe would like to register to vote (Stringer I docket no. 77, appx. 120, RFA 23) and the stored electronic \nsignature is used. Thus, there is no real distinction in processing of online transactions and mail-in \ntransactions other than the physical signature on the mail-in form, which is not compared with the \nelectronic signature, not used for DPS purposes, and not forwarded to SOS for voter registration \npurposes. \n34 \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 97   Filed 08/28/20   Page 35 of 68\ndisproportionately harm voter participation by various groups, including racial minorities. \n52 U.S.C.  20501(a)(1)-(3). \n§ \nThe stated purposes of the Act are \n(1) to establish procedures that will increase the number of eligible citizens who register \nto vote in elections for Federal office; \n(2) to make it possible for Federal, State, and local governments to implement this \nchapter in a manner that enhances the participation of eligible citizens as voters in \nelections for Federal office; \n(3) to protect the integrity of the electoral process; and \n(4) to ensure that accurate and current voter registration rolls are maintained. \n52 U.S.C.  2050 l(b)(l)-(4). \n§ \nBased on these findings and for these stated purposes, Congress imposed national \nprocedures for voter registration for elections for federal office as follows: \n(a) In general \nExcept as provided in subsection (b), notwithstanding any other Federal or State law, in \naddition to any other method of voter registration provided for under State law, each State \nshall establish procedures to register to vote in elections for Federal office \n(1) by application made simultaneously with an application for a motor vehicle driver's \nlicense pursuant to section 20504 of this title; \n(2) by mail application pursuant to section 20505 of this title; and \n(3) by application in person \n(A) at the appropriate registration site designated with respect to the residence of the \napplicant in accordance with State law; and \n(B) at a Federal, State, or nongovernmental office designated under section 20506 of this \n35 \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 97   Filed 08/28/20   Page 36 of 68\ntitle. \n52 U.S.C.  20503 (emphasis added). \n§ \nSection 20504 specifically describes the requirements for a simultaneous application for \nvoter registration and motor vehicle driver's license: \n(a) In general \n(1) Each State motor vehicle driver's license application (including any renewal \napplication) submitted to the appropriate State motor vehicle authority under State law \nshall serve as an application for voter registration with respect to elections for Federal \noffice unless the applicant fails to sign the voter registration application. \n(2) An application for voter registration submitted under paragraph (1) shall be \nconsidered as updating any previous voter registration by the applicant. \n*  *  * \n(c) Forms and procedures \n(1) Each State shall include a voter registration application form for elections for Federal \noffice as part of an application for a State motor vehicle driver's license \n(2) The voter registration application portion of an application for a State motor vehicle \ndriver's license \n(A) may not require any information that duplicates information required in the driver 's \nlicense portion of the form (other than a second signature or other information necessary \nunder subparagraph (C)); \n(B) may require only the minimum amount of information necessary to \n(i) prevent duplicate voter registrations; and \n(ii) enable State election officials to assess the eligibility of the applicant and to \nadminister voter registration and other parts of the election process; \n36 \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 97   Filed 08/28/20   Page 37 of 68\n(C) shall include a statement that \n(i) states each eligibility requirement (including citizenship); \n(ii) contains an attestation that the applicant meets each such requirement; and \n(iii) requires the signature of the applicant, under penalty of perjury; \n*  *  * \n(d) Change of address \nAny change of address form submitted in accordance with State law for purposes of a \nState motor vehicle driver's license shall serve as notification of change of address for \nvoter registration with respect to elections for Federal office for the registrant involved \nunless the registrant states on the form that the change of address is not for voter \nregistration purposes. \n52 U.S.C.  20504 (emphasis added). \n§ \nSection 20506(a)(5)(C) further states that \"A person who provides service.  shall not \n. . \n\"take any action the purpose or effect of which is to discourage the applicant from \nregistering to vote.\" \nAnd finally, Section 20510 provides civil enforcement by the Attorney General and a \nprivate right of action for any person \"who is aggrieved by a violation of this chapter,\" 52 U.S.C. \n§ 2051 0(a)-(b), and the \"rights and remedies.. .  are in addition to all other rights and remedies \nprovided by law,\" 52 U.S.C.  205 10(d). \n§ \nThe notice provision in  205 10(b) further states: \n§ \n(1) A person who is aggrieved by a violation of this chapter may provide written notice of \nthe violation to the chief election officials of the State involved. \n(2) If the violation is not corrected within 90 days after receipt of a notice under \nparagraph (1), or within 20 days after receipt of the notice if the violation occurred within \n37 \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 97   Filed 08/28/20   Page 38 of 68\n120 before the date of an election for Federal office, the aggrieved person may bring a \ncivil action in an appropriate district court for declaratory or injunctive relief with respect \nto the violation. \n(3) If the violation occurred within 30 days before the date of an election for Federal \noffice, the aggrieved person need not provide notice to the chief election official of the \nState under paragraph (1) before bringing a civil action under paragraph (2). \n52 U.S.C.  205 10(b)(2)-(3). \n§ \nThe NVRA expressly reminds us that \"it is the duty of the Federal, State, and local \ngovernments to promote the exercise of [the fundamental right to vote].\" 52 U.S.C. \n§ \n20501 (a)(2). And it is the duty of \"Federal, State, and local governments to implement this \nchapter. .  .\". 52 U.S.C. § 2050 1(b)(2). The State of Texas has combined state and federal voter \nregistration; thus, the ability to vote in state and local elections will be affected by any federal \nviolation in the registration process. See ACORNv. Miller, 129 F.3d 833, 837 (6th Cir. 1997) \n(explaining that NVRA registration requirements will affect state and local elections). More \nimportantly, there is nothing in the NYRA stating that a voter must be disenfranchised in a \nfederal election before they can bring an enforcement action. In fact, nothing in the NVRA states \nthat a voter must be disenfranchised at all.  See 52 U.S.C.  20510 (b)(1) (\"A person who is \n§ \naggrieved by a violation of this chapter. \n. \nC.  Past arguments not raised herein \n1.  Sovereign immunity \nIn Stringer I, Defendants asserted that Plaintiffs failed to validly invoke the NVRA' s \nlimited waiver of immunity and were not entitled to bring an action under the Ex parte Young \nexception to immunity. Defendants have not invoked sovereign immunity in Stringer II, but the \nCourt addresses the issue in the event it is raised again at some juncture. The NVRA imposed \n38 \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 97   Filed 08/28/20   Page 39 of 68\nvoter registration requirements on the states to ensure that all practical barriers that make voter \nregistration more restrictive or inconvenient are removed.  More than thirty years later, there are \nstates like Texas that still refuse to comply with its mandates. Congress's abrogation of immunity \nunder the NVRA is clear and unequivocal. When a state fails to comply with the Act, the Act \nauthorizes judicial intervention. The Attorney General can seek declaratory or injunctive relief, \nand the Act establishes a private right of action for individuals aggrieved by a violation under the \nAct. 52 U.S.C. § 205 10(a)-(b), (d). Defendants have admitted that they \"each play a part in \nimplementing the NVRA in Texas.\" Stringer I docket no. 82, p. 4. The Secretary of State is chief \nelection officer, and DPS is a voter registration agency. Id. As such, they may be sued in any \nenforcement action arising from violations. The evidence clearly shows that Defendants have had \nample notice and opportunity to cure and come into compliance. Moreover, the Supreme Court \nhas long recognized Equal Protection claims of this nature against state officials tasked with \ncarrying out laws that affect the rights of voters. Crawford v. Marion County, 553 U.S. 181 \n(2008) (Equal Protection claim against the Indiana Secretary of State and others challenging state \nvoter ID law); Burdick v.  Takishi, 504 U.S. 428 (1992) (voter's Equal Protection claim against \nHawaii Director of Elections and others challenging state write-in voting prohibition). Thus, \nsovereign immunity is not an issue herein. \n2.  Renewal v. change of address \nIn Stringer I, Defendants also alleged that Plaintiffs' challenge should be restricted to \nonline change of address transactions, not online renewal transactions, because Plaintiffs' \ntransactions were for a change of address rather than renewal. Again, this argument has not been \nraised in Stringer II. As noted previously, however, this argument seems to go to the underlying \nreason for the transaction, rather than the lawfulness of the process being challenged. Regardless \nof whether a Texan seeks to change his address or renew his driver's license online, the process \n39 \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 97   Filed 08/28/20   Page 40 of 68\nis the same and the outcome is the same. DPS uses the same website (Texas.gov) and the same \n\"Driver's License Renewal and Change of Address\" system, which authenticates users, detects \neligibility, and processes data in the same manner for both renewals and changes of address. \nStringer I docket no. 94-9, deposition of E. Hutchins, at 30:4-31:16; 33:8-34:1; Stringer I docket \nno. 94-12, deposition of S. Gipson, at 37:10-16 (the process is combined online, \"it's one system \ninterface\"); Stringer I docket no. 93, website links and exh. A-i, A-2, A-10 (DPS!Driver' s \nLicense Division online process for driver's license renewal and/or change of address). Neither \ntype of transaction, using the same online process, allows simultaneous applications for voter \nregistration as required by the NVRA. Stringer I docket no. 94-12, deposition of S. Gipson, at \n37:10-40:5. Given that Defendants have chosen to combine the online process and use the same \nsystem for both change of address and renewal transactions, a change in programming to allow \nonline simultaneous voter registration would mean a change for both types of transactions. \nLikewise, an NVRA violation in online change of address transactions imputes a violation in \nonline renewal transactions because Defendants admit that the online process (which \nencompasses both) does not allow simultaneous voter registration. Having combined the online \nprocess for both types of transactions, both types of transactions fall within the same mandates \nunder 52 U.S.C.  20503(a)(1) and 20504 and will be affected by any relief granted herein. \n§ \nAccord Miller, 129 F.3d at 837 (the State chose, as a matter of convenience, to implement one \nvoter registration process for federal, state, and local elections; thus, the registration obligations \nimposed by the Act affect registration procedures associated with state and local elections). For \nthese reasons, the real issue is whether DPS' s online process for driver's license renewal and \nchange of address violates the NYRA by failing to allow simultaneous applications for voter \nregistration. \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 97   Filed 08/28/20   Page 41 of 68\nD.  Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits of their NYRA claims \nPlaintiffs' NVRA claims have not changed since Stringer I. First, Plaintiffs contend \nDefendants have violated and continue to violate the NVRA by failing to provide simultaneous \napplications for voter registration during online driver's license transactions. Second, Plaintiffs \ncontend Defendants have violated and continue to violate the NVRA by requiring persons who \nuse the online process to take additional steps to update their voter registration and separately \nsubmit information through a different transaction with a different agency that duplicates \ninformation required in the driver's license transaction. And third, Plaintiffs allege that \nDefendants have violated the NVRA by failing to ensure eligible applicants are registered to vote \nand to transmit voter registration information submitted online to the appropriate State election \nofficial within the statutorily required time frame. \n1.  Statutory interpretation \nIn Stringer I, the parties disagreed on the meaning of some of the applicable provisions in \nthe NVRA. Assuming their positions remain unchanged, the Court reviews the governing \nprinciples of statutory construction. The first step is to determine whether the statutory text, when \nconsidered in context, is plain and unambiguous. If the statutory language is plain, the Court \nmust enforce it according to its terms. King v. Burwell, 135 S.Ct. 2480, 2489 (2015) (citing \nHardt v. Reliance Standard Life Ins. Co., 560 U.S. 242, 251 (2010)). \"[O]ftentimes the \"meaning \nor ambiguity  of certain words may only become evident when placed in context.\" Id. (citing \nFDA v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 529 U.S. 120, 132 (2000)). \"So when deciding \nwhether the language is plain, we must read the words 'in their context and with a view to their \nplace in the overall statutory scheme.\" Id. (quoting, in part, Brown & Williamson, 529 U.S. at \n133). \"Our duty, after all, is 'to construe statutes, not isolated provisions.\" Id. (quoting, in part, \nGraham County Soil and Water Conservation Dist. v.  United States ex rel.  Wilson, 559 U.S. 280, \n41 \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 97   Filed 08/28/20   Page 42 of 68\n290 (2010)). \"A provision that may seem ambiguous in isolation is often clarified by the \nremainder of the statutory scheme..  because only one of the permissible meanings produces a \n. \nsubstantive effect that is compatible with the rest of the law.\" King v. Burwell, 135 S .Ct. at 2492 \n(quoting United Say. Assn. of Tex v.  Timbers of Inwood Forest Associates, Ltd., 484 U.S. 365, \n371(1988)). The Court cannot interpret a federal statute in a manner that negates its own stated \npurpose. See id. at 2495; see also New York State Dept. of Social Servs. v. Dublino, 413 U.S. \n405, 419-20 (1973). \n2.  The NVRA applies to motor voter transactions conducted online \nThe requirements in the NVRA clearly apply to online transactions (also known as \nelectronic, remote, or internet transactions). There is nothing in the statute that expressly or \nimpliedly excludes online transactions; instead, the plain language of the NVRA indicates that it \napplies to all transactions. See 52 U.S.C.  20504 (a)(1) (\"Each State motor vehicle driver's \n§ \nlicense application. . .\") and (d) (\"any change of address form. .  .\") (emphasis added). \nNumerous courts have determined that the NVRA applies to online or remote transactions with \nthe same force as it applies to in person and mail transactions. See, e.g, Action NC v.  Strach, 216 \nF.Supp. 3d 597, 622-23 (M.D.N.C. 2016) (\"[the] words 'each' and 'any' as used in NVRA \nprovision requiring that each state motor vehicle driver's license application serve as application \nfor voter registration and that any change of address form submitted shall serve as notification of \nchange of address for voter registration were unambiguous and reflected Congress' intent to \nmake the NVRA applicable to 'each' and 'every' covered transaction, irrespective of whether the \ntransaction occurred remotely or in person\"); Kemp, 841 F. Supp. 2d at 133 1-32 (explaining that \nthe NVRA cannot be read to cover only in-person transactions and Georgia's limited \ninterpretation and implementation that excluded internet transactions conflicted with its \nacknowledgment that noncompliance likely led to decline in voter registration as more applicants \n42 \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 97   Filed 08/28/20   Page 43 of 68\nprefer to apply remotely). \nDefendants have not argued that the NVRA does not apply to online or remote \ntransactions. In fact, they have admitted that compliance with the NVRA is required for online \ntransactions. See Stringer I docket no. 77, appx. 65, deposition of S. Gipson (DPS), at 94:5-12 \n(Q: Why does DPS include a voter registration question during the online renewal and change of \naddress portion? A: So it is part of the plan between the Secretary of State and Department of \nPublic Safety in compliance with the voter registration question being combined as part of the \napplication process for a diver license or ID\"); 95:5-15 (Q: What requires you to do that? A: \nbasically the NVRA and Chapter 20 of the Election Code and Texas Statute.); Stringer I docket \nno. 94-8, deposition of S. Gipson at 136:20-23 (Q: Why does DPS require customers to answer \nthat question if they don't even retain the answer? A: The  because we need to offer them the \navailability of the application); Stringer I docket no. 94-11, deposition of K. Ingram (SOS), at \n62:4-8 (Q: Why is there a voter registration question on the online DPS transaction \napplication?.. . A: Well, I imagine it's because of Section 5 of the National Voter Registration \nAct of 1993. Q: Could you elaborate on that a little bit? A: Sure. The National Voter Registration \nAct of 1993 required that motor vehicle agencies, in our case the DPS, whenever a person has a \ndriver's license transaction  driver's license transaction, that they should be simultaneously \noffered the right  the ability to update their voter registration or register to vote for the first time. \nThat's why the NVRA is called the Motor Voter law.\"). Yet Defendants' compliance with the \nNVRA falls short when it comes to online transactions. Texans have repeatedly complained \nabout DPS's failure to process voter registration information through its online system, but \nDefendants have refused to correct the deficiencies. Thus, rather than furthering the purpose of \nthe NVRA by \"establish[ing] procedures that will increase the number of eligible citizens who \n43 \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 97   Filed 08/28/20   Page 44 of 68\nregister to vote,\"30 the State is thwarting the efforts of Texans who wish to register to vote. \n3.  The \"simultaneous application\" requirement \nCongress was not subtle about requiring DPS, a voter registration agency, to provide a \nsimultaneous application for voter registration. The terms are used more than once in the statute, \nand its plain meaning is clear and unambiguous. Section 20503, titled \"National procedures for \nvoter registration for elections for Federal office,\" directs that \"each State shall establish \nprocedures to register to vote.  by application made simultaneously with an application for a \n.  . \nmotor vehicle driver's license.\" 52 U.S.C.  20503(a)(l). Defendants do not dispute the meaning \n§ \nof \"simultaneous,\" which is defined as \"existing or occurring at the same time; exactly \ncoincident,\"31 or \"happening or being done at exactly the same time,\"32 or  \"occurring, operating, \nor done at the same \ntime.\"33 \nSection 20504, titled \"Simultaneous application for voter registration and application for \nmotor vehicle driver's license\" explains this requirement as one simultaneous application form \nthat serves dual purposes  driver's license and voter registration. This section, when read in \ncontext, not only requires that the applications be simultaneous, but discusseS them in terms of a \nsingle transaction. Under subsection (a), each State motor vehicle driver's license application \n\"(including any renewal application).  shall serve as an applicationf or voter registration\" \n.  . \nand \"[a]n application for voter registration.  shall be considered as updating any previous \n.  . \nvoter registration by the applicant.\" Under subsection (c), \"[e]ach State shall include a voter \n°52 U.S.C.  20501(b)(1) \n§ \n31https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/simultaneous \n32https://dictionary.cambridge.orglus/dictionary/english/simultaneous \n33https://en.oxforddictionaries.comidefinitionlsimultaneous \n44 \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 97   Filed 08/28/20   Page 45 of 68\nregistration application form. . . as part of an application for a State motor vehicle driver's \nlicense,\" and the \"voter registration application portion of an application for a State motor \nvehicle driver's license. . . may not require any information that duplicates information required \nin the driver's license portion of the form.\" 52 U.S.C.  20504(a),(c). Under subsection (d), \n§ \n\"[a]ny change of address form\".  for purposes of a State motor vehicle driver's license shall \n.  . \nserve as notification of change of address for voter registration.  unless the registrant states on \n.  . \nthe form that the change of address is not for voter registration purposes.\" 52 U.S.C.  20504(d). \n§ \nIn Stringer I, Defendants seemed to have a clear understanding of what the statute \nrequires, yet they distorted the statutory language in the interpretations they proposed. For \nexample, Mr. Ingram with SOS testified that \"the NVRA requires a simultaneous opportunity to \nregister to vote.\" See Stringer I docket no. 77, appx. 40, deposition of K. Ingram, at 63:15-16; \n64:24-25; see also appx. 113, RFA no. 4 (inserted the word \"opportunity\" when asked to admit \ntheir legal obligations under the NVRA). In Stringer I, defense counsel used the same \n\"simultaneous opportunity\" argument in their briefs. But the NVRA plainly and unequivocally \nrequires DPS, a voter registration agency, to provide a simultaneous application  not merely a \n\"simultaneous opportunity\" to go through a second duplicate application process with SOS. \n\"Opportunity\" could mean many things, but we do not need to speculate about what it means \nbecause the NVRA does not use that term. Likewise, Ms. Gipson testified that DPS \"need[s] to \noffer them the availability of the application.\" Stringer I docket no. 94-8, deposition of S. \nGipson, at 136:20-23. But the NYRA requires more than simply making voter registration \napplications \"available.\" Again, making applications \"available\" could mean many things but the \nNVRA does not use that term. The operative terms in the NYRA are much more commanding \nand specific: it clearly and unequivocally requires a \"simultaneous application\" with DPS (the \nvoter registration agency), not a mere \"opportunity\" to go through a wholly separate, non- \n45 \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 97   Filed 08/28/20   Page 46 of 68\nsimultaneous application process with SOS. If the Court were to accept the argument that DPS \ncan simply direct Texans to SOS to obtain, fill out, sign, and mail in or deliver in person a wholly \nseparate voter registration form, the language in the NVRA would be rendered meaningless. \nPlaintiffs have been correct in their assertion that this central fact has never been disputed: when \neligible Texans update their driver's licenses online with DPS, they are not provided a \nsimultaneous application to register to vote or update their voter registration information. The \nNVRA' s requirement that DPS, a voter registration agency, provide a simultaneous application \nfor both driver's license and voter registration purposes is plain and unambiguous and the facts in \nthe record confirm that Texans are being deprived of this statutory right. Stringer I docket no. 77, \nappx. 118, admission no. 8 (Defendants admit that now when applicants reach Step 5 of the \nonline process, they are asked \"Do you want to request a voter application?\"); admission no.  11 \n(Defendants admit that if an eligible voter checks \"yes\" under the question \"Do you want to \nrequest a voter application?,\" they are not registered to vote..  unless they submit an image of \n. \ntheir signature, either by submitting a signed application by mail, or providing an electronic \nimage of their physical signature in person at a DPS location) (emphasis added); appx. 121, \nadmission no. 9 (Defendants admit that a \"Yes\" answer during an online transaction is never \nentered as a response in the Voter Field for purposes of forwarding the information to SOS); \nappx. 123, admission nos. 21, 23 (Defendants admit that when an eligible voter who updates his \nor her driver's license information on the current DPS website responds \"yes\" under the \nstatement \"Request a voter registration application,\" DPS does not transfer his or her data to \nSOS); appx. 96, admission no. 8 (Defendants admit that an eligible voter who changes the \naddress on her non-commercial Texas driver's license online must submit a signed voter \nregistration application in person or by mail in order for his voter registration information to be \nupdated.

Thus, it is clear that \nDefendants are violating 52 U.S.C.  20503 and 20504 by failing to comply with the \n§ \nsimultaneous application requirement. \n4.  The duplicate information prohibition \nTo further the simultaneous application requirement, Congress saw fit to prohibit the \nstates from requiring duplicate information. The prohibition against duplicate information is \nplain and unambiguous, leaving no room for argument as to its meaning. Section 20504(c)(2)(A) \nclearly states that \"{tjhe voter registration application portion of an application for a State motor \nvehicle driver's license may not require any information that duplicates information required in \nthe driver's license portion of the form.\" This prohibition reinforces the simultaneous application \nrequirement because an application that is truly simultaneous does not require duplication. On \nthe other hand, any process that requires duplication of information is an indication that the voter \nregistration \"portion\" of an application for a State motor vehicle driver's license is not truly \nsimultaneous. The NVRA does permit states to seek a \"minimum amount\" of additional \ninformation that may be necessary for \"State election officials to assess the eligibility of the \napplicant\" for voter registration purposes. 52  20504 (c)(2)(B),(C). But the minimum \n§ \n47 \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 97   Filed 08/28/20   Page 48 of 68\ninformation necessary to verify voter registration eligibility cannot duplicate the information \nalready provided for driver's license purposes. For example, some states do not require \ncitizenship to obtain a driver's license, so those states could include a citizenship question in the \nvoter registration portion of the application without violating the duplicate information \nprohibition. But Texas DPS requires an applicant to answer a citizenship question for driver's \nlicense purposes; thus, another duplicate question about citizenship for voter registration \npurposes would violate this prohibition. \nDefendants' violation of the duplicate information prohibition is indisputable, and has \ncontinued unabated. Defendants admit that none of the information in the online application for \ndriver's license renewal or change of address is used for voter registration purposes. At the end \nof the DPS transaction, a \"yes\" answer does not mean that the information already provided will \nbe used for voter registration purposes pursuant to the NVRA. Instead, the DPS transaction ends, \nnone of the information already provided is forwarded to SOS, and the user is directed to SOS \nfor an entirely separate voter registration application that requires the same information already \nprovided to DPS in the driver's license transaction. It is a separate and distinct transaction with a \nseparate office (SOS) which requires a separate and distinct application with duplicate \ninformation. Stringer I docket no. 77, appx. 96, admission no. 8 (Defendants admit that upon \ncompletion of the DPS transaction, a voter must follow the link to SOS and then \"request that a \nvoter registration be mailed to them.  and [the portal] contains language indicating that the \n.  . \nseparate form must be filled out in order to complete the voter's registration\"); appx. 132 (change \nof address transaction informs users that their DPS transaction does not register them to vote and \nthey must follow link to SOS website where a separate voter application form can be downloaded \nor requested); appx. 134 (separate voter registration application provided by SOS that must be \nprinted, signed, and mailed); Stringer I docket no. 93, exh.

Gipson, at 218:2-219:16 (explaining that at end of DPS transaction, \nthe customer is directed to SOS if he wants to register to vote or update his voter registration \ninformation). \nIn Texas, DPS requires applicants seeking a renewal and/or change of address to provide \nseveral pieces of information, including their name, address, driver's license number, date of \nbirth, and the last four digits of their Social Security number. Stringer I docket no. 94-8, \ndeposition of S. Gipson, at 234:2-9; Stringer I docket no. 94-9, deposition of E. Hutchins, at \n25:11-22; Stringer I docket no. 77, appx. 130. When customers finish their transaction with DPS \nand then go to SOS to fill out a completely separate application for voter registration purposes, \nthey must provide the same information  name, address, driver's license number, date of birth, \n: \nand the last four digits of their Social Security number. Stringer I docket no. 77, appx. 134 (voter \nregistration application); Stringer I docket no. 94-7, deposition of B. Schonhoff, at 157:19- \n158:18 (both the DPS change of address form and SOS voter registration form ask the person's \nname, date of birth, and address; applicants would have to fill this information out twice). \nRequiring motor voters to go to a different agency (SOS) to obtain and fill out a separate \napplication that requires the same information violates the prohibition against duplicate \ninformation set forth in 52 U.S.C.  20504(c). \n§ \n5.  The timely submission requirement \nThe NYRA also requires that \"a completed voter registration portion of an application for \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 97   Filed 08/28/20   Page 50 of 68\na State motor vehicle driver's license accepted at a State motor vehicle authority shall be \ntransmitted to the appropriate State elections official not later than 10 days after the date of \nacceptance.\" 52 U.S.C. § 20504(e)(1). The deadline for transmittal is shorter (five days) if the \nvoter registration application is accepted within five days before the last day for registration to \nvote in an election. 52 U.S.C. § 20504(e)(2). Because the evidence in the record shows that DPS \ndoes not provide simultaneous voter registration as part of the online driver's license renewal and \nchange of address process, DPS does not transmit to SOS any voter registration information in \nconnection with such transactions. In fact, it is undisputed that DPS does not even record, and \ntherefore cannot transmit, responses to the voter registration question in the online driver's \nlicense renewal and change of address application. Stringer I docket no. 94-8, deposition of S. \nGipson at 136:10-19; Stringer I docket no. 77, appx. 67, deposition of S. Gipson at 102:10- \n19:103:16-25; Stringer I docket no. 94-7, deposition of B. Schonhoff at 159:23-160:3; 220:18-23. \nAs a voter registration agency, DPS has a statutory duty to provide motor voters with \nsimultaneous voter registration applications and transmit the applications to SOS within 10 days \nafter acceptance. DPS admits it does not submit voter registration information to SOS for online \ntransactions conducted by motor voters \"[b}ecause [theyl have not been advised by the Secretary \nof State that providing that through the online process is permissible at this point.\" Stringer I \ndocket no. 77, appx. 67, deposition of S. Gipson at 103:16-25. The NVRA's timely submission \nrequirement continues to be violated in every online renewal and change of address transaction. \n6.  State law must yield to federal law \nThe uncontested facts in the record lead to only one conclusion: DPS, a voter registration \nagency, does not provide a simultaneous voter registration application to individuals who engage \nin online driver's license transactions. Instead, motor voters are simply directed to SOS, which \n50 \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 97   Filed 08/28/20   Page 51 of 68\nrequires them to fill out a completely separate voter registration application with duplicate \ninformation, and then print, mail, and/or hand deliver it to the voter registrar. But Defendants \nhave refused to change their practice, claiming that Texas election law does not allow the \nprocedure dictated by the NVRA. This argument is fatally flawed. \nDefendants have claimed that the NVRA incorporates Texas election law, making it \nsubject to state law, and rely on the following provisions: \n(a)  In general \n(1)  Each State motor vehicle driver's license application (including any \nrenewal application) submitted to the appropriate State motor vehicle \nauthority under State law shall serve as an application for voter \nregistration. \n*  *  * \n(d)  Change of address \nAny change of address form submitted in accordance with State law for purposes \nof a State motor vehicle driver 's license shall serve as notification of change of \naddress for voter registration. \n52 U.S.C.  20504(a)(l), (d). \n§ \nThese provisions neither incorporate Texas election law nor make it subject thereto. \nInstead, the plain language of these provisions, when considered in context and with a view to \ntheir place in the overall statutory scheme, simply mean that driver's license applications \nsubmitted in accordance with state driver's license laws, i.e., the Texas Transportation Code, \nshall also serve as applications for voter registration purposes. The reference to state law in these \nprovisions cannot be interpreted to mean the NVRA is dictated by the election laws of 50 \n51 \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 97   Filed 08/28/20   Page 52 of 68\ndifferent states, as it would be contrary to the plain language of the statute, require the Court to \ntake it out of context, and render the NVRA entirely meaningless. The NVRA was enacted under \nthe Elections clause, U.S. Const. Art. I § 4, ci. 1, which gives Congress the broad power to \npreempt, alter, and supplant state law when it comes to federal voter registration practices. \nArizona v. InterTribal County ofArizona, Inc., 570 U.S. 1, 133 S. Ct. 2247, 2253-57 (2013). \n(\"The Clause's substantive scope is broad\" and \"Elections Clause legislation, so far as it extends \nand conflicts with the regulations of the State, necessarily supersedes them\"). To the extent state \nvoter registration procedures are inconsistent with the NVRA, they are superseded. Id. at 2253-54 \n(\"the state law, so far as the conflict extends, ceases to be operative\"). On the other hand, the \nNVRA does not supplant state driver's license laws. Thus, interpreting the provisions in 52 \nU.S.C. § 20504(a)(1) and (d) to mean that driver's license applications submitted in accordance \nwith the Texas Transportation Code shall also serve as applications for voter registration \npurposes is consistent with the purpose of the Act and the entire statutory scheme. \nDefendants have consistently argued that DPS, the voter registration agency tasked with \ncarrying out the mandates of the NVRA, cannot provide individuals with simultaneous driver's \nlicense - voter registration applications because Texas election law requires a physical signature \nor \"wet signature.\" In other words, Defendants claim that a physical signature written by hand is \nnecessary to comply with Texas election law; therefore, although online driver's license \ntransactions are legally valid, a simultaneous voter registration application would be legally \ninvalid. Again, this argument is flawed for several reasons. \nFirst, Texas law cannot be used as an excuse for failing to comply with the NYRA. To the \nextent it is inconsistent with the NYRA, the Texas Election Code must yield to the NVRA. \nMoreover, Defendants have simply cherry-picked the provisions they believe justify their \n52 \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 97   Filed 08/28/20   Page 53 of 68\ncontinued noncompliance. Defendants believe sections 13.002(b) and 15.02 1(a) of the Texas \nElection Code (requiring an application to be \"signed\") support their position,34 but they ignore \nsection 20.062 (requiring DPS to use a form and procedure that combines driver's license! \nrenewal/change of address with voter registration), which does not support their \nposition.35 \nDefendants' reliance on Texas election law as an excuse for federal noncompliance is misplaced \nbecause it is preempted, altered, and supplanted by the mandates in the NVRA. But even if Texas \nelection law was not preempted, there is nothing in the law that precludes the use of electronic \nsignatures. \nSecond, the NVRA does state that a simultaneous driver's license-voter registration \napplication and any renewal application \"requires the signature of the applicant.\" See 52 U.S.C. \n§ \n20504(a)( 1), (c)(2)(C)(iii). The NVRA's change of address provision is separate, and does not \nstate that a signature is necessary for a simultaneous driver's license-voter registration change of \naddress. 52 U.S.C. § 20504(d). But even in renewal transactions that require a signature, neither \nthe NVRA nor Texas election law defines or limits the type of signature that is required for voter \nregistration renewal or change of address applications, and Defendants cite no authority for the \nproposition that it must be a physical ink or wet signature written on paper by hand. With twenty- \nfirst century technology and legislation such as the Global and National Commerce Act (E-Sign \nAct) and Uniform Electronic Transactions Act (UETA), electronic signatures are legally \n34Stringer I docket no. 94-11, deposition of K. Ingram, at 97:15-24; docket no. 77, appx. 42 (Q: \nWhat portion of the law doesn't allow it? A: 13.002(b)). \n35Section 20.062(a) states: The Department of Public Safety shall prescribe and use a form and \nprocedure that combines the department's application form for a license or card with an officially \nprescribed voter registration application form. Section 20.062(b) states: The department shall prescribe \nand use a change of address form and procedure that combines department and voter registration \nfunctions. The form must allow a licensee or cardholder to indicate whether the change of address is also \nto be used for voter registration purposes. \n53 \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 97   Filed 08/28/20   Page 54 of 68\nrecognized and widely used. 15 U.S.C.  7001 et. seq.; Unif. Electronic Transactions Act, U.L.A. \n§ \n(1999). Under the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act, which has been adopted by Texas and \n46 other states, the medium in which a signature is created, presented or retained does not affect \nits legal significance. See UETA § 7; Tex. Bus. & Corn. Code Ann. § 322.007(a),(c),(d) (Vernon \n2015) (TUETA). As these provisions explain: \n(a)  A record or signature may not be denied legal effect or enforceability solely \nbecause it is in electronic form. \n(c)  If a law requires a record to be in writing, an electronic record satisfies the law. \n(d)  If a law requires a signature, an electronic signature satisfies the law. \nInterpreting the signature requirement in the NVRA to include electronic signatures is consistent \nwith the purpose of the Act and the overall statutory scheme. Accord Kemp, 208 F. Supp. 3d at \n1335-36 (Georgia SOS argued that the \"records\" requirement in the NVRA was limited to \nphysical records; the court determined that the requirement includes electronic records). Mr. \nIngram, the 30(b)(6) representative for SOS, admits that an electronic signature complies with \nthe signatures requirements under the N\\TRA. Stringer I docket no. 77, appx. 40, deposition of K. \nIngram at 62:18-63:1 (\"DPS' s compliance with [the NVRA] for in-person transactions is \n[satisfied by] the question.  on the DPS forms, 'Do you want to register to vote? I've agreed to \n.  . \nprovide my electronic signature, and it can be sent to the Secretary of State's Office.\"). If an \nelectronic signature is legally sufficient under the NVRA for paper transactions, it is legally \nsufficient for online transactions. The NVRA established procedures to remove barriers to voter \nregistration, to make the process easier and more convenient, and to increase voter participation. \nInterpreting the \"signature\" requirement to allow only physical, manual, or wet ink signatures \nwritten by hand on paper would be inconsistent with the plain language of the NVRA and the \n54 \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 97   Filed 08/28/20   Page 55 of 68\nentire statutory scheme. And while Defendants continue to rely on Texas election law as a excuse \nfor noncompliance with the NVRA, there is nothing in Texas law that precludes the use of \nelectronic records and electronic signatures. On the contrary, Texas law permits SOS and DPS to \naccept electronic records and electronic signatures. See Tex. Bus. & Corn. Code § 322.017 (each \nstate agency has the option to accept electronic records and electronic signatures);36 Tex. Bus. & \nCorn. Code § 322.007 (\"If a law requires a signature, an electronic signature satisfies the law.\").37 \nAnd it is undisputed that Texas is already using voter registration signatures in electronic form. \nSee Tex. Election Code § 20.066 (for in person and mail transactions, the information provided is \ninput \"into the department's electronic data system\"; the applicant is informed \"that the \napplicant's electronic signature\" will be used; and the department \"electronically transfer[s] the \napplicant's voter registration data, including the applicant's [electronic] signature, to the \nsecretary of state\"); 1  Tex. Admin. Code § 81.58 (allowing a voter's signature to be captured by \nan electronic device for the signature roster). Defendants provide no legal justification for failing \nto comply with the NVRA when it comes to online renewal and change of address transactions. \nFinally, Plaintiffs are not asserting that all signature requirements be tossed out or \nignored. Instead, they are asserting that Defendants already retain electronic signatures for every \n36AS Eiten Hersh (an expert in Stringer I) noted, the refusal to accept electronic signatures \nappears to have been a state policy decision. See Stringer I docket no. 94-13, deposition of E. Hersh, at \n12 1:23-122:25. But state policy  like state law  must yield to the mandatory requirements under the \nNVRA. \n37See also Tex.

Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits of the Fourteenth Amendment claim \nPlaintiffs also assert that Defendants' refusal to provide voter registration applications \nsimultaneously with online driver's license renewal and change of address transactions \nconstitutes a violation of their Equal Protection rights under the Fourteenth Amendment.39 The \nright to vote is a fundamental right protected under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth \nAmendment. Harper v.  Va. State Bd. of Elections, 383 U.S. 663, 670 (1966). \"The right to vote \nis protected in more than the initial allocation of the franchise. Equal protection applies as well to \nthe manner of its exercise.\" Bush v. Gore, 531 U.S. 98, 104 (2000) (per curiam). The Equal \nProtection Clause applies when state procedures restrict voters' rights. Bush v.

The Court must review the merits in \ndetermining preliminary injunctive relief, so it addresses the issue again. In Stringer I, the \nplaintiffs asserted that the Anderson-Burdick4° standard applies (Stringer I docket no. 77, pp. 19- \n23; Stringer I docket no. 85, pp. 16-17), while Defendants asserted that an Arlington Heights41 \n39\"The rights and remedies established by [the NVRA] are in addition to all other rights and \nremedies provided by law.\" 52 U.S.C.  205 1O(d)(1). \n§ \n40Anderson v.

Persons who renew or change their driver's license in person or by mail need only check \na single box indicating that he would like to register or update his voter information. After \nchecking the box on the driver's license form, no further steps are necessary. DPS sends the \nupdated information to SOS in nightly batches, so the voter registration is updated timely and \nefficiently. However, persons who renew or change their driver's license online are denied the \nsame process. They first go through the steps to renew or change the address on their license \nonline, then must end their DPS driver's license transaction before going to SOS to obtain, print, \nand complete a separate voter registration application which requires duplicate information. Once \nthe additional application is complete, it must be mailed or hand delivered. DPS, a voter \nregistration agency, maintains a procedure that accepts simultaneous voter registration \napplications for some, while rejecting them for others. This type of restriction on voter \nregistration imposes a burden on the fundamental right to vote that warrants the demonstration of \na corresponding interest sufficiently weighty to justify the limitation. \nDefendants'  only justification for the voter registration burden imposed on motors voters \nis the \"signature\" requirement under Texas election law. However, neither federal nor state law \nlimits the signature requirement to physical hand written signatures on paper (or \"wet \nsignatures\"). Electronic signatures and electronic records are legally recognized and widely used, \n59 \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 97   Filed 08/28/20   Page 60 of 68\neven by Defendants, and Defendants offer no reason for refusing to accept them for online \ntransactions. DPS already uses electronic records and previously imaged electronic signatures for \nevery Texan that uses the online system for driver's license renewal or change of  And \naddress.44 \nSOS already uses electronic records and previously imaged electronic signatures for voter \nregistration purposes and admits that electronic signatures comply with signature requirements \nunder the NVRA and Texas Election Code.45 SOS admits it never uses physical, manual, or wet \nink handwritten signatures on paper for voter registration purposes.46 DPS already has, in its \npossession and control, an electronic signature of every motor voter that has been issued a \nlicense. With motor voters' electronic signatures already in the voter registration agency's \npossession, there is no reason why Defendants cannot use them in an online driver's license-voter \nregistration transaction when it already uses them in mail and in-person transactions. \nNeither the law nor the facts support Defendants' alleged justification for limiting \nsimultaneous voter applications to in-person and mail transactions and refusing simultaneous \nvoter applications for persons that renew or change their driver's license online. Because the \n44Stringer I docket no. 77, appx. 70, deposition of S. Gipson at 215:21-216:7 (for online \ntransactions, Texas has decided that a previously captured electronic signature is sufficient for driver's \nlicense purposes, but they refuse to accept the same signature for voter registration purposes); Stringer I \nStipulation no. 11 (\"The signature that appears on the license generated as a result of a customer's online \ndriver's license renewal or change of address transaction is an image of the applicant's physical \nsignature, electronically captured during the applicant's most recent in-person transaction\"). \n45Stringer I docket no. 77, appx. 39-40, 42, K.

Defendants fail to demonstrate a corresponding interest sufficiently weighty to justify \nthe limitation on voters' rights. \nNot oniy have Defendants failed to justify their actions, but they also acknowledge that \npermitting simultaneous voter applications for individuals that renew or change their driver's \nlicense online would be technologically very feasible and the cost would be minimal. See \nStringer I docket no. 77, appx. 45-46, deposition of K. Ingram at 184:19-185:2 (it's \"technically \npossible\" and \"I don't think it would cost a lot of money\"), 186:15-16 (\"I'm not contesting the \nlogistics of it\"); Stringer I docket no. 77, appx. 90, deposition of J. Crawford (from an IT \nperspective, DLS is currently capable of sending the voter data and electronic signature to SOS); \nsee also Stringer I docket no. 94-13, deposition of E. Hersh at 110:6-10 (it would be a \"massive \ncost savings\");  111:10-13 (the savings would be statewide); Stringer I report of E. Hersh at pp. 6, \n12-15 (the technology clearly exists for state motor vehicle authorities that allow online \ntransactions). In fact, the undisputed testimony reflects that changing the online process to \ninclude simultaneous voter registration applications would very likely lead to greater efficiency \nfor the State and increased voter registration for Texans. See Stringer I docket no. 94-13, \ndeposition of E. Hersh at 114:8-10; 114:24-115:14 (having people filling out information by \nhand and then having state employees key that information in electronically leads to more errors); \nStringer I report of E.

Even assuming the State had legitimate interests, which it \nhas not shown, if the State also has open to it a less drastic way of satisfying those interests it \n61 \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 97   Filed 08/28/20   Page 62 of 68\nmay not choose a scheme that restricts the right to vote. Anderson, 460 U.S. at 806. \nBased on the facts before the Court, there is a substantial likelihood that Plaintiffs will \nsucceed on the merits of their NVRA and Equal Protection claims. \nVI. \nSubstantial threat of irreparable injury \nIt is undisputed that the individual plaintiffs were not simultaneously registered to vote at \nthe time of their online transactions with DPS, a designated voter registration agency. It is \nundisputed that they remained unregistered to vote at the time this suit was filed, and they were \nonly registered prior to the primary election as a result of court order. It is undisputed that as a \nresult of Mr. Stringer's move to a new residence on August 15, 2020, he is again unregistered to \nvote in the precinct in which he resides. Mr. Stringer's declarations and deposition testimony, \nwhich are uncontested, demonstrate a substantial risk that Mr. Stringer will use the online DPS \nSystem prior to the October 5 voter registration deadline to change the address on his driver's \nlicense and update his voter registration. By Defendants' own admissions, their system does not \nprovide simultaneous voter registration, and their failure to change the system to come into \ncompliance unequivocally demonstrates a substantial risk that Mr. Stringer will be injured by his \ninability to simultaneously update his voter registration when he uses the DPS System to change \nthe address on his driver's license. Mr. Stringer will remain unregistered to vote after using the \nDPS System, and he will remain unregistered after the October 5 voter registration deadline, \nwhich will result in disenfranchisement in the November 3 general election. This threatened \nfuture injury  lack of simultaneous voter registration as a result of Defendants' unlawful process \nand resulting disenfranchisement  more than satisfies the standing necessary for preliminary \ninjunctive relief See Stringer v.  Whitley, 942 F.3d at 720 (\"plaintiffs seeking injunctive [  relief \n] \n62 \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 97   Filed 08/28/20   Page 63 of 68\ncan satisfy the redressability requirement only by demonstrating a continuing injury or threatened \nfuture injury.\"). Mr. Stringer's threatened future injury will be (1) potentially suffered by him, \nnot someone else; (2) \"concrete and particularized,\" not abstract; and (3) \"actual or imminent, \nnot 'conjectural' or 'hypothetical.' \"Id. at 720-21. With the deadline for voter registration on \nOctober 5, and the general election less than thirty days thereafter, there is a substantial risk that \nMr. Stringer will be disenfranchised if he is not registered to vote; thus, the threatened future \ninjury is indisputably \"imminent.\" Moreover, Mr. Stringer's future threatened injury is \"fairly \ntraceable\" to Defendants' continued failure to comply with the NVRA and the unjustified burden \non Mr. Stringer's statutory and constitutional rights. \nThe future injury  disenfranchisement  is irreparable, The right to vote is a fundamental \nright, and the deprivation of such right is something Mr. Stringer \"will never be able to recover.\" \nStringer v.  Whitley, 942 F.3d at 726. (Ho, J., concurring). But the injury that will occur between \nnow and October 5, the voter registration deadline, is still redressable with immediate injunctive \nrelief. Mr. Stringer has already been injured twice and he should not be forced to wait and suffer \na third constitutional deprivation when it can be avoided by granting temporary injunctive relief. \nTexas v.  US., 809 F.3d at 173 n.  137 (citing United States v. Emerson, 270 F.3d 203, 262 (5th \nCir. 200 1)). \nVII. \nBalance of harm and public interest \nThe harm to Mr. Stringer  the inability to register to vote pursuant to the NVRA and \nbeing disenfranchised as a result  clearly outweighs the minimal burden that will be placed on \n47As Judge Ho warned, \"[a]s citizens, we can hope it is a deprivation they will not experience \nagain.. .\".). Defendants failed to heed Judge Ho's warning and it is happening again. At some point a \nknown violation must be addressed. \n63 \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 97   Filed 08/28/20   Page 64 of 68\nDefendants by simply being ordered to comply with the NVRA, a federal law that has been in \nexistence since 1993. Defendants have been on notice of their continuous violation of the NVRA \nsince at least 2016 (the commencement of Stringer I), yet Defendants' practices have remained \nunchanged. The public clearly has a paramount interest in removing voter registration barriers \nand having procedures that encourage rather than discourage voter registration. Defendants have \noffered no factual or legal argument that would justify denying the simultaneous voter \nregistration to which Mr. Stringer is legally entitled. As Defendants have admitted, there are no \ntechnological barriers to compliance and corrective measures would not be costly. Uncontested \nexpert testimony shows that a compliant DPS system would very likely lead to great efficiency, \nless human error, a massive saving in costs, and increased voter registration. \nVIII. \nInjunctive relief is appropriate \nSince 2016, and every time that injunctive relief has been considered, defense counsel has \nargued that compliance with the NVRA would take too long for the time frame in question \neven though the time frame has been different every time. At this juncture, the evidence does not \nsupport such representations. \nWhen permanent injunctive relief was being considered in Stringer I, Defendants alleged \nthat corrective measures would take 90 days to implement. However, when this lawsuit was \ninitiated, and it was apparent nothing had changed, the Court ordered the parties to meet and \nconfer with persons who understand the technology and then conduct discovery on the feasability \nand time frame for implementation of corrective measures. The Court also ordered that \nDefendants track, retain, and preserve the following information: (1) since November 2016, the \ntotal number of persons who renewed or updated their driver's license online, answered \"yes\" to \n64 \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 97   Filed 08/28/20   Page 65 of 68\nthe voter registration/application question or indicated that they wanted to register to vote or \nupdate their voter registration as part of the same transaction, and were not simultaneously \npermitted to register to vote or update their voter registration; and (2) since November 2016, the \nnumber of persons who renewed or updated their driver's license online, answered \"yes\" to the \nvoter registration/application question or indicated that they wanted to register to vote or update \ntheir voter registration as part of the same transaction, were not simultaneously registered to vote \nor their voter registration was not updated, and are still not registered to vote and/or their voter \nregistration has not been updated as a result.\" Docket nos. 31, 47. Defendant began capturing \nand retaining such data on or about February 14, 2020.48 DPS also planned to begin accepting \nonline voter registration information from the online portal, processing the information into the \nDriver's License System database, updating the individuals' driver's license records with that \ninformation, and transmitting the data to SOS on May 17, 2020.  DPS worked with SOS on \ndeveloping the format and transmission process for the voter registration data it will be sending, \nand SOS approved the plans.5° This information will be transmitted to SOS in precisely the same \nformat and layout that voter registration information is already sent from DPS to SOS for in- \nperson and by-mail driver's license transactions, and will only include information for \nindividuals who answer \"yes\" to the online voter registration application question.51 These files \nwill include the electronic signature image for each DPS customer in the same format and \n48Docket no. 69, appx. 19, deposition of S. Gipson, at 67:19-21. \n49Docket no. 69, appx. 17-18, 21-22, deposition of S. Gipson, at 40:22-41:6; 70:23-71:11. \n50Docket no. 69, appx. 22-23, deposition of S. Gipson, at 71:12-72:8. \n51Docket no. 69, appx. 12-14, deposition of S. Gipson, at 27:2-29:16. \n65 \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 97   Filed 08/28/20   Page 66 of 68\nprocess those images are sent for in-person and by-mail transactions.52 The files also have fields \nfor including answers to additional questions that are asked on paper voter registration forms \n(such as whether the individual would like to serve as an election judge), but the fields will \npresently be left blank pending further orders.53 The only changes needed by DPS in order to \nfinish a complete systemic fix are to implement simple front-end changes to the website to \ninclude additional language mirroring a paper voter registration application. This includes adding \na question about serving as an election judge, what type of voter registration it is (a new \nregistration or an update), and language, including attestation language, to make clear that the \napplicant is applying to register to vote.54 Most of these changes have already been approved and \nmocked up and should only take one to two weeks to implement if and when directed to do \nso.55 \nDPS is waiting further direction before proceedings with these changes.56 Even if the front-end \nchanges are not already entirely ready to roll out, these types of changes would take two or at \nmost three weeks to implement.57 \nThe evidence now suggests that the cost to SOS to begin processing such data is \nnegligible or non-existent.58 This is because SOS already receives nightly files from DPS that \ninclude the relevant information for processing a voter registration application for in-person DPS \n52Docket no. 69, appx.  14, deposition of S. Gipson, at 29:18-24. \n53Docket no. 69, appx. 15-17, deposition of S. Gipson, at 38:19-40:21. \n54Docket no. 69, appx  15-17, 30-32, deposition of S. Gipson, at 38:19-40:21; 93:21-95:5. \n55Docket no. 69, appx. 24, deposition of G. Gipson, at 74:1-9. \n56Docket no. 69, appx. 31, deposition of S. Gipson, at 94:2-8. \n57Docket no. 69, appx. 25, deposition of S. Gipson, at 79:1-5. \n58Docket no. 69, appx. 44-45, 53-54, deposition of K. Ingram, at 71:25-72:3; 118:2-119:20. \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 97   Filed 08/28/20   Page 67 of 68\ntransactions, and when DPS has implemented the changes outlined herein, the information for \nindividuals transacting with DPS online will reach SOS in the same format and be \nindistinguishable from in-person transactions. In fact, implementing a full fix to the online \ndriver's license portal would save money for the Secretary of State. As a result of this process \nthat has already been put into place  which the Court commends  the State would need \napproximately two weeks to complete the process and provide a fully simultaneous, non- \nduplicative voter registration application to online driver's license customers. This updated \nsystem would be the simplest and least burdensome form of relief, address the violations asserted \nherein, and provide a remedy for the imminent, irreparable harm to Mr. Stringer. \nIx. \nConclusion \nDPS encourages Texans to use its online services to renew their driver's license and \nchange their address because it is easier and more convenient.59 It cannot, at the same time, deny \nsimultaneous voter registration applications when those online services are used. DPS is legally \nobligated, as a designated voter registration agency under the NVRA, to permit a simultaneous \nvoter registration application with every transaction. Defendants are violating § § 20503 (a)( 1); \n20504(a),(c),(d), and (e); 20506(4)(A)(iii), and (d); and 20507(a)(l)(A) of the NYRA and their \nexcuses for noncompliance are not supported by the facts or the law. Plaintiffs are also being \ndenied equal protection under the law. Although the Court does not reach the issue of standing as \nto each plaintiff and intervenor-plaintiff, only one plaintiff must have Article III standing for the \nCourt to consider injunctive relief. Mr. Stringer has shown he has standing to seek preliminary \ninjunctive relief and he is entitled to the relief being sought herein. \n59Stringer I docket no. 94-9, deposition of E. Hutchins, at 38:18-23; 39:12-19. \n67 \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 97   Filed 08/28/20   Page 68 of 68\nIt is therefore ORDERED that Plaintiffs' Motion for Preliminary Injunction (Docket no. \n5) is GRANTED. Defendants are ORDERED to immediately take all remaining steps necessary \nto come into compliance with the NVRA and the U.S. Constitution and establish a DPS System \nthat treats each online driver's license renewal or change-of-address application as a \nsimultaneous application for voter registration. Defendants must complete this process and the \nDPS system must be fully operable for public use on or before September 23, 2020. Mr. Stringer \nmust be able to use the online DPS System to change the address on his driver's license and \nsimultaneously update his voter registration no later than September 30, 2020 to ensure that his \nvoter registration information is transmitted to the Secretary of State and he is registered in a \ntimely manner. See 52 U.S.C. § 20504(e)(l),(2). The Secretary of State must file an advisory \nwith this Court no later than October 2, 2020 confirming that it has fully complied with the \nCourt's order and that Mr. Stringer has been registered to vote through the updated DPS System. \nSIGNED this 28th day of August, 2020. \nORLANDO L.

HILTON:\n6      Q.   Good morning, Ms. Newman.\n7      A.   Hi.\n8      Q.   Could you please state and spell your name one\n9 more time for the record?\n10      A.   Sure.  It’s Jacqueline Newman,\n11 J-A-C-Q-U-E-L-I-N-E N-E-W-M-A-N.\n12      Q.   And you’re here on behalf of DCCC to testify\n13 as their representative today, right?\n14      A.   I am.\n15      Q.   Before starting to prepare for this, I\n16 truthfully didn’t know a whole lot about the DCCC and\n17 what it does.  I think I’m still pretty murky on the\n18 details, and I’m hoping you can explain for me so I can\n19 kind of understand more today.  Can you just start me\n20 off with kind of an overview about what the DCCC is,\n21 what its purpose is, what it does?\n22      A.   Sure.  The DCCC is the national party tasked\n23 with electing Democrats to the U.S. House of\n24 Representatives.\n25      Q.   You said it’s a party?\nIntegrity Legal Support Solutions\nwww.integrity-texas.com\n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 85   Filed 06/15/20   Page 8 of 100\nDCCC - 4/28/2020\n7\n1      A.   Yes.\n2      Q.   Is it separate from, like, the Democratic\n3 Party; or how does that work?\n4      A.   Yes.  I mean, we are part of the Democratic\n5 Party.  We are separate from the Democratic National\n6 Committee, which is often what people think of when they\n7 think of the National Democratic Party.\n8      Q.   So you’re separate from the Democratic\n9 National Committee.  Is it a subordinate role, is it a\n10 partnership; or what’s the relationship there?\n11      A.   I would say we’re affiliated, but we are\n12 not -- we are not interlinked in any way.  And we are\n13 also not their subordinate.\n14      Q.   Okay.  And, I mean, I just didn’t know.  Do\n15 you have a separate Party platform, or how does that\n16 work?\n17      A.   Yes, I mean, we don’t necessarily have a\n18 platform as the DCCC.\n19      Q.   Okay.  And why is that?\n20      A.   That’s just not something we set out to do.\n21      Q.   So what do you set out to do?  I mean, is it\n22 primarily fundraising; or just what is, you know?\n23      A.   We -- again, we’re trying to elect Democrats\n24 to the U.S. House of Representatives; and so we support\n25 campaigns in a variety of ways and functions.\nIntegrity Legal Support Solutions\nwww.integrity-texas.com\n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 85   Filed 06/15/20   Page 9 of 100\nDCCC - 4/28/2020\n8\n1      Q.   Okay.  Well, we’ll go through some of the\n2 details of some of that later.  I guess I would like to\n3 start, also, with understanding a little bit more about\n4 you and your background.  So you’re currently employed\n5 by the DCCC; is that right?\n6      A.   I am.\n7      Q.   And what’s your role?\n8      A.   I’m the Deputy Executive Director and Chief\n9 Operating Officer.\n10      Q.   Okay.  And what are the responsibilities for\n11 those roles?\n12      A.   I oversee all the administrative and\n13 operations functions for the building -- or for the\n14 committee, that includes the building itself, our Human\n15 Resources functions, our budgets, our legal activity,\n16 just making sure everything is functioning as it should.\n17      Q.   How many employees does DCCC have?\n18      A.   Right now we are roughly at about 265\n19 employees.\n20      Q.   So these are folks that receive a paycheck\n21 from DCCC?\n22      A.   Yes.\n23      Q.   And where are they located, and what kind of\n24 work do they engage in?  I’m trying to get a sense of,\n25 you know, who’s out there.\nIntegrity Legal Support Solutions\nwww.integrity-texas.com\n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 85   Filed 06/15/20   Page 10 of 100\nDCCC - 4/28/2020\n9\n1      A.   Sure.  They -- our employees are located\n2 across the country.  The majority are based in DC.  We\n3 have several employees that are on the ground in Texas\n4 as it relates to this case.\n5      Q.   Uh-huh.  And as far as your job, Deputy\n6 Executive Director -- did I get that right?\n7      A.   Yes.\n8      Q.   How long have you had that role?\n9      A.   I think I’ve had this title since September.\n10 I’ve been with the committee in some fashion since 2014,\n11 and I was previously with the committee in 2012.\n12      Q.   And what about the COO title, how long have\n13 you had that?\n14      A.   About two and a half years.\n15      Q.   Okay.  Who -- what’s the reporting -- what’s,\n16 I guess, the leadership structure?  You’re the Deputy\n17 Executive Director, so I assume you report to an\n18 Executive Director.  Is there anyone else you report to,\n19 other folks that report to you?  Can you give me a sense\n20 of that?\n21      A.   Yes, you’re right.  There’s an Executive\n22 Director who oversees all the day-to-day functions of\n23 the committee; and then we also have a Chair of the\n24 committee, Congresswoman Cheri Bustos.\n25      Q.   Anyone else that you report to?\nIntegrity Legal Support Solutions\nwww.integrity-texas.com\n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 85   Filed 06/15/20   Page 11 of 100\nDCCC - 4/28/2020\n10\n1      A.   No.\n2      Q.   And then who reports to you?\n3      A.   I have a team below me, a Chief Administrative\n4 Officer, IT Director.\n5      Q.   Is that it, there’s two people that report to\n6 you?\n7      A.   Oh, I’m sorry.  Then there’s some junior-level\n8 staffers below them who are kind of the senior team and\n9 then HR and Administration Manager.\n10      Q.   Okay.  How many people would you say report to\n11 you directly?\n12      A.   I think it’s about eight or nine people.\n13      Q.   Okay.  Are there any other deputy executive\n14 directors, or are you the only one?  Like, a lot of\n15 agencies have, like, multiple deputy commissioners in\n16 charge of certain things.\n17      A.   Sure.  There are two other deputy executive\n18 directors.\n19      Q.   What are their names, and what are their\n20 responsibilities?\n21      A.   One is Ryan Hedgepeth, and he is our Deputy\n22 Executive Director for Member Engagement.  He works\n23 directly with members of our caucus, members of\n24 Congress.  And Mike Smith is also a Deputy Executive\n25 Director, and he oversees our fundraising operations.\nIntegrity Legal Support Solutions\nwww.integrity-texas.com\n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 85   Filed 06/15/20   Page 12 of 100\nDCCC - 4/28/2020\n11\n1      Q.   Has there been any change to that structure in\n2 the time that you’ve been with the DCCC?\n3      A.   The Deputy Executive Director structure?\n4      Q.   Yes, yeah.\n5      A.   Yes, there has.\n6      Q.   So what were the changes and when did they\n7 occur, again, just kind of focusing on this top-level\n8 structure?\n9      A.   Sure.  So I’m sorry.  Could you -- did you say\n10 this year or during my entire time at the DCCC?\n11      Q.   Just since you’ve been at DCCC.\n12      A.   Sure.  So each cycle, which is a two-year\n13 election period, the DCCC goes through the process of --\n14 at one point it was appointing and now it’s electing a\n15 Chair of the committee.  And each Chair that comes in is\n16 able to kind of re-image the structure as they see\n17 necessary in order to carry out their goals for the\n18 cycle.  And so with that, I would say each cycle there\n19 has been a slightly different leadership structure.\n20      Q.   Can you give me some examples, maybe?  Maybe\n21 if it changes every two years regularly, we don’t have\n22 to go through every one; but if you could, kind of give\n23 me a sense of what type of changes that there are.\n24      A.   Sure.  So usually -- I think in the past few\n25 cycles there has been a Deputy Executive Director, at\nIntegrity Legal Support Solutions\nwww.integrity-texas.com\n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 85   Filed 06/15/20   Page 13 of 100\nDCCC - 4/28/2020\n12\n1 least one or a few.  And last cycle there was one Deputy\n2 Executive Director, and they reported to the Executive\n3 Director.  In other cycles there have been a few deputy\n4 executive directors that kind of oversee a few key\n5 functions of the building and then report back to the\n6 Executive Director.  Again, it just kind of depends on\n7 the Executive Director and the Chair at the time.\n8      Q.   How are the Executive Director and the Chair\n9 chosen?\n10      A.   Currently -- and this is a somewhat recent\n11 change -- the Chair of the committee is elected by the\n12 Democratic Caucus, and the Executive Director is hired\n13 by the Chair.\n14      Q.   Okay.  And so you’ve been with DCCC since 2014\n15 and then another stint before then.  Is it typical to\n16 have a long tenure, you know, for employees to be\n17 tenured that length of time; or is there a lot of\n18 turnover with these two-year cycles?\n19      A.   Yeah, it’s definitely more common that people\n20 work a cycle and then they move on to another\n21 opportunity.  There’s a lot of turnover usually.\n22      Q.   Is some of that top down?  I mean, does the\n23 Executive Director bring in their own people every year\n24 or...\n25      A.   No.  I think it’s more just the nature of\nIntegrity Legal Support Solutions\nwww.integrity-texas.com\n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 85   Filed 06/15/20   Page 14 of 100\nDCCC - 4/28/2020\n13\n1 campaigns that every two years people are moving on to\n2 something else.  I think you would see -- and this\n3 partially explains why I’ve been here longer than most\n4 people, but the administrative functions are the people\n5 who tend to stay cycle to cycle.  And the people who\n6 work kind of in different parts of the committee are\n7 often moving on to other campaigns or other\n8 organizations.\n9      Q.   So that would be more typical of the folks who\n10 do the fundraising or the -- I forget how you put it --\n11 the direct interfacing with the caucus members?\n12      A.   Yes.\n13      Q.   Okay.  You’ve been here, you know, at DCCC\n14 quite a while.  I take it you enjoy your job?\n15      A.   I do.\n16      Q.   What do you enjoy about your job?\n17      A.   I think the work we do is important, and I\n18 like the values we represent.\n19      Q.   Okay.  What values?\n20      A.   I think electing Democrats to the U.S. House\n21 of Representatives -- you know, the House, I think,\n22 impacts a lot of change within this country; and it’s\n23 important that we expand and protect our majority.\n24      Q.   You’ve mentioned that a couple of times\n25 already and we’re going to talk -- you know, one of the\nIntegrity Legal Support Solutions\nwww.integrity-texas.com\n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 85   Filed 06/15/20   Page 15 of 100\nDCCC - 4/28/2020\n14\n1 missions of DCCC and we’re going to talk more about that\n2 throughout; but is that the best statement of the\n3 mission, to elect Democrats?\n4      A.   Definitely.\n5      Q.   Is there any other component of that, or is\n6 that really what it’s all about?\n7      A.   I think everything ties back to electing\n8 Democrats.\n9      Q.   Okay.\n10               MR. HILTON:  I’m going to send out\n11 through the chat what’s actually -- I’m going a little\n12 out of order.  I kind of prenumbered some of these.  So\n13 I’m going to send out Exhibit 5 now, and then we’ll come\n14 back to the other ones.\n15               (Exhibit 5 discussed.)\n16      Q    (BY MR. HILTON)  So let me know if you’re able\n17 to access Exhibit 5; and once you’ve had a chance to\n18 pull it up and review it, let me know.\n19      A.   Okay.  I have it open.\n20      Q.   Is that your LinkedIn page, at least part of\n21 it?\n22      A.   Yes.\n23      Q.   And I should say -- I forgot to mention this\n24 before -- other than the documents that I send you and\n25 then the Bates numbered documents that your counsel\nIntegrity Legal Support Solutions\nwww.integrity-texas.com\n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 85   Filed 06/15/20   Page 16 of 100\nDCCC - 4/28/2020\n15\n1 provided to you that were the DCCC’s production, do you\n2 have any other documents in front of you, with you?  Are\n3 you referring to any other documents?\n4      A.   No, I don’t.\n5      Q.   Okay.  I’ll ask for you to continue not to do\n6 that; and if you do refer to another document, please\n7 let me know.  And I think the same thing goes with\n8 talking to other people, including by e-mail, text, you\n9 know, anything like that.  Please refrain from doing\n10 that, you know, until the deposition is over.  And if\n11 you do do that, I’d ask that you please, you know, let\n12 me know.\n13               All right.  So turning to Exhibit 5,\n14 which is at least a portion of your LinkedIn page, it\n15 has employment history for you going back to May 2008.\n16 I was kind of hoping you could walk me through each of\n17 these positions, starting with May 2008, and explain to\n18 me -- obviously, we don’t have to go into a huge amount\n19 of detail for all of these; but if you could, explain to\n20 me just kind of generally what the company was or what\n21 the organization was, what your role was, and kind of\n22 give me a sense of the evolution of your career.  That’s\n23 my goal here.\n24               So if you could just kind of start from\n25 GIS Specialist at the Timmons Group and work your way\nIntegrity Legal Support Solutions\nwww.integrity-texas.com\n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 85   Filed 06/15/20   Page 17 of 100\nDCCC - 4/28/2020\n16\n1 through, I think that’s the most efficient way to go\n2 about it.\n3      A.   Okay.  Sure.  So in 2008 I worked with the\n4 Timmons Group, which is an engineering firm.  I was a\n5 GIS Specialist at the time, Geographic Information\n6 Systems.\n7      Q.   What is a Geographic Information System?\n8      A.   It’s like a lot of building kind of digital\n9 maps.  That’s what I did, usually, for local governments\n10 that were hoping to convert to a modern era, if you\n11 will.\n12      Q.   In what sense?\n13      A.   Like, the work I did was taking, like, paper\n14 documents, land parcels, and I was digitizing them.\n15      Q.   Oh, I see.  So any kind of, you know, records\n16 or whatever, just trying to make it into a modern\n17 electronically-accessible system?\n18      A.   Yeah, yeah, basically.\n19      Q.   Got it.  Any particular projects that stand\n20 out from that time?  I don’t mean to make you go all the\n21 way back through your career.\n22      A.   Oh, sure.  No, no.  So most of the work I\n23 specialized in, we worked with a lot of rural, I guess,\n24 counties and locations; and they were in the process of\n25 trying to basically get up and running a system that --\nIntegrity Legal Support Solutions\nwww.integrity-texas.com\n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 85   Filed 06/15/20   Page 18 of 100\nDCCC - 4/28/2020\n17\n1 where people in their location can call 9-1-1 and it\n2 would be linked to their home, which I think is\n3 something that, especially in urban and suburban areas,\n4 people take for granted that you call 9-1-1 and they\n5 know where you’re calling from.  So that required\n6 digitizing all of the maps and then linking each, like,\n7 land parcel to the phone information we had for people\n8 living there.  That was the majority of the work I did\n9 at Timmons.\n10      Q.   Okay.  And I’m sorry to dwell on this, but it\n11 looks like your career kind of takes a more political --\n12 or politically-oriented turn from here.  Did you do any\n13 political type work or redistricting or anything like\n14 that when you were with Timmons Group?\n15      A.   I didn’t do any political work with Timmons.\n16 I was involved through my school; and while I was\n17 working at Timmons, I took on a side project, which is a\n18 strong majority the role I did above it.  And so I was\n19 kind of doing that in my spare time.\n20      Q.   All right.  Well, I know I asked you to just\n21 kind of walk me through this and let you explain it; and\n22 then I immediately interrupted you.  So sorry about\n23 that, but maybe you can pick it up from there and\n24 continue to walk me through the rest of your career.\n25      A.   Sure.  So for a strong majority, I was their\nIntegrity Legal Support Solutions\nwww.integrity-texas.com\n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 85   Filed 06/15/20   Page 19 of 100\nDCCC - 4/28/2020\n18\n1 Compliance Director.  I basically oversaw their\n2 bookkeeping and was responsible for accounting and\n3 reporting through the Virginia State Board of Elections,\n4 just maintaining their compliance.\n5               And then I found myself in Indiana, where\n6 I was hired as the Deputy Director of Compliance and\n7 Operations; and in that role -- you will sense a theme\n8 here -- but I oversaw the HR, the operations and the\n9 bookkeeping budgets and compliance for the Indiana\n10 Democratic Party.\n11      Q.   And I’m sorry to interrupt you one more time,\n12 at least.  I should have started with this, but I\n13 forgot.  What was your -- what education did you have\n14 that led you into all these roles?  Like, I think you\n15 mentioned you were still in school when you started with\n16 Timmons.  Now, what were you in school for?  What\n17 degree, if any, did you attain?\n18      A.   Sure.  I went to school, and I received a\n19 bachelor’s degree in geography.\n20      Q.   And I know as a component of that, there’s a\n21 lot of, you know, technical and software and all sorts\n22 of stuff like that that kind of led you to be able to do\n23 the more technical side of things that you’re doing?\n24      A.   Yes.\n25      Q.   Okay.  All right.  I interrupted you again.\nIntegrity Legal Support Solutions\nwww.integrity-texas.com\n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 85   Filed 06/15/20   Page 20 of 100\nDCCC - 4/28/2020\n19\n1 I’m sorry.  Let’s try it again.\n2      A.   No problem.  So I was in Indiana briefly.  I\n3 stayed through the end of the election cycle and moved\n4 back to Virginia.  In April of 2011 I started with\n5 Protect Your Care and Know Your Care as their Director\n6 of Operations.  Again, I kind of oversaw the budget\n7 aspects, the compliance, HR.  After --\n8      Q.   I’m sorry.  What is that group?\n9      A.   It was a 501(c)(3) and (c)(4) organized around\n10 educating people on Obamacare --\n11      Q.   Okay.\n12      A.   -- and the Affordable Care Act.\n13      Q.   Okay.\n14      A.   In 2012 I took a job with the DCCC as their\n15 Director of Operations on their 2012 Independent\n16 Expenditure Program; and in that role, I managed the\n17 administrative functions for the IE, which is a large\n18 paid media campaign.\n19      Q.   And when you say a paid media campaign, can\n20 you elaborate a little bit on that?\n21      A.   Sure.  It’s mostly a bunch of TV ads that the\n22 DCCC puts out.\n23      Q.   And what was the nature of the ads?  What was\n24 the purpose?\n25      A.   To elect Democrats to the U.S. House.\nIntegrity Legal Support Solutions\nwww.integrity-texas.com\n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 85   Filed 06/15/20   Page 21 of 100\nDCCC - 4/28/2020\n20\n1      Q.   Anywhere in particular?  Any particular type\n2 of ad; or was it just, you know, all House members?\n3      A.   It was certainly focused in our targeted\n4 races.  I don’t know how much that was off the top of my\n5 head; but I would say, ballpark, it probably covered\n6 about 30 races across the country.\n7      Q.   And -- okay.  I think that’s enough for now.\n8 I’ll let you continue.\n9      A.   Following 2012 I took a job with Terry\n10 McAuliffe’s campaign for governor in Virginia; and I\n11 operated largely in the same capacity for that roll,\n12 overseeing all the operations functions, HR, budgets,\n13 legal.\n14      Q.   Was that a successful campaign?\n15      A.   It was a successful campaign.\n16      Q.   He’s still governor, right?  Did he get re-\n17 elected since then or...\n18      A.   He is not still governor --\n19      Q.   Oh, okay.\n20      A.   -- but he is always around.\n21      Q.   Okay.\n22      A.   So you feel like he’s still governor.\n23               And then, following his successful\n24 campaign, after his inauguration I returned to the DCCC\n25 as Deputy Chief Operating Officer and over the years\nIntegrity Legal Support Solutions\nwww.integrity-texas.com\n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 85   Filed 06/15/20   Page 22 of 100\nDCCC - 4/28/2020\n21\n1 have slowly progressed.\n2      Q.   You’ve stayed around and stayed in a couple\n3 different roles, and I know how it goes when you stay at\n4 a place for a long time.\n5               I guess the only other one I wanted to\n6 ask you about specifically was Interim Executive\n7 Director from July of 2019 to September 2019.  How did\n8 you come to have that role, and the way you’re\n9 describing -- I guess my other question is, as your\n10 primary viewpoint, you know, if it goes in two-year\n11 election cycles, is that a down period since the 2018\n12 election had just been over?\n13               What was -- I guess I was saying all of\n14 that to say -- I’ll give you an actual question that you\n15 can answer.  How did you come to get that role, what did\n16 you do during that period, and how did that relate to\n17 the cyclical nature of DCCC’s work?\n18      A.   Sure.  So we had a leadership transition in\n19 the middle of our cycle this year, which actually isn’t\n20 common.  Usually an Executive Director would be hired in\n21 December or January and stay for two years or longer in\n22 some cases.  So there was a leadership transition.  In\n23 that moment I stepped up to be the Interim Executive\n24 Director, and largely I ran the entire process to find a\n25 permanent Executive Director.\nIntegrity Legal Support Solutions\nwww.integrity-texas.com\n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 85   Filed 06/15/20   Page 23 of 100\nDCCC - 4/28/2020\n22\n1      Q.   And you say there was a leadership transition.\n2 I’m assuming that someone had signed up to do the role\n3 and then moved on to take another opportunity\n4 unexpectedly?\n5      A.   Yes.\n6      Q.   Okay.  And you may have mentioned this.  I\n7 just don’t recall.  Where did you say you went to, got\n8 your bachelor’s?\n9      A.   I went to the University of Mary Washington in\n10 Fredericksburg, Virginia.\n11      Q.   Well, I appreciate all that.  It’s always\n12 helpful to know.  Even though you’re a representative on\n13 DCCC’s behalf, it’s extremely helpful to know your\n14 perspective, your background, and your expertise.  So I\n15 appreciate you walking me through that.  I know talking\n16 about the full length of one’s career is not necessarily\n17 the most exciting, but I appreciate it.\n18               I would like to turn now to talk a little\n19 bit about how you -- you know, about the depo itself and\n20 how you prepared for this deposition today.  So I guess\n21 start there.  What did you do to prepare for the\n22 deposition today?\n23      A.   Sure.  Well, I discussed with my counsel.  I\n24 reviewed the Complaint that we had filed and reviewed\n25 the Deposition Notice topics.  I also reviewed a\nIntegrity Legal Support Solutions\nwww.integrity-texas.com\n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 85   Filed 06/15/20   Page 24 of 100\nDCCC - 4/28/2020\n23\n1 declaration that a member of my team had submitted in\n2 response to this.\n3      Q.   Any other documents?\n4      A.   I gathered information related to the\n5 deposition topics, but that was it.\n6      Q.   How did you gather information?\n7      A.   I guess searching through DCCC documents.\n8      Q.   Okay.  Did you search through e-mails or some\n9 other source of documents?\n10      A.   I think mostly just documents that are on our\n11 drive, like on --\n12      Q.   Did you use search terms, or did you just\n13 browse through them?\n14               MS. BRANCH:  I want to just object to the\n15 extent that it calls for attorney-client privileged\n16 information.\n17               But you can answer as long as you’re not\n18 revealing any of the content of our conversations.\n19      Q.   (BY MR. HILTON)  Yeah.  And particularly in\n20 this prep area it gets kind of close to that.  I am not\n21 asking you for content of any conversations with your\n22 attorneys.  So please do not provide that information.\n23 I don’t want it.  It is privileged, so.\n24               All right.  So you said that you were\n25 just browsing through files, I guess, based on your\nIntegrity Legal Support Solutions\nwww.integrity-texas.com\n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 85   Filed 06/15/20   Page 25 of 100\nDCCC - 4/28/2020\n24\n1 knowledge and familiarity with the files of the\n2 organization?\n3      A.   Yes, that’s correct.\n4      Q.   Did you speak to anyone other than your\n5 attorneys?\n6      A.   Just our -- yes, with our attorneys.\n7      Q.   But no other employees of DCCC or anyone else\n8 other than your attorneys?\n9      A.   Right.\n10               (Exhibit 1 discussed.)\n11      Q.   (BY MR. HILTON)  Okay.  I’d like to turn to\n12 Exhibit 1, which I had sent out previously via the Zoom\n13 chat.  And do you recognize Exhibit 1?\n14      A.   Yes.\n15      Q.   And what is it?\n16      A.   These are the deposition topics you sent in a\n17 Notice for this role.\n18      Q.   Right.  And so let’s turn to page 5 of\n19 Exhibit 1.  The heading is 30(b)(6) Corporate\n20 Representative Deposition Topics?\n21      A.   Yes.\n22      Q.   Are you prepared to testify as to all these\n23 topics today?\n24      A.   I am.\n25      Q.   And then I’d like to go to page 6.  The\nIntegrity Legal Support Solutions\nwww.integrity-texas.com\n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 85   Filed 06/15/20   Page 26 of 100\nDCCC - 4/28/2020\n25\n1 heading is Attachment B.  These are the document\n2 requests that we sent in connection with this Notice; is\n3 that right?\n4      A.   Yes.\n5      Q.   And it sounds like you searched for documents\n6 that were responsive to these requests?\n7      A.   I worked with my counsel on this.\n8      Q.   Okay.  Did DCCC produce documents responsive\n9 to these requests?\n10      A.   Yes.\n11      Q.   So did DCCC comply with these requests?\n12      A.   Yes.\n13               (Exhibit 2 discussed.)\n14      Q.   (BY MR. HILTON)  Okay.  The next one is going\n15 to be Exhibit 2, which, hopefully, is the Complaint in\n16 this matter.\n17      A.   Yes.\n18      Q.   So you have Exhibit 2 in front of you?\n19      A.   I do.\n20      Q.   And have you seen this document before?\n21      A.   I have.\n22      Q.   Did you review it before it was filed?\n23      A.   Yes.\n24      Q.   How much time did you spend reviewing it,\n25 before it was filed, I mean?\nIntegrity Legal Support Solutions\nwww.integrity-texas.com\n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 85   Filed 06/15/20   Page 27 of 100\nDCCC - 4/28/2020\n26\n1      A.   Before it was filed?\n2      Q.   Yes.\n3      A.   Probably -- to be clear, you mean the\n4 Complaint itself or in preparation for the Complaint?\n5      Q.   I’m breaking it into two parts.  So the first\n6 part is:  How much time did you spend reviewing the\n7 Complaint before it was filed?  And then the next part\n8 will be:  Did you review it again for this deposition,\n9 and how much time did you spend reviewing it?\n10      A.   I probably spent about 30 minutes reviewing\n11 the Complaint before it was filed.\n12      Q.   Okay.  And you said you reviewed it again to\n13 prepare for the deposition today.  How much time did you\n14 spend then?\n15      A.   Probably about an hour.\n16      Q.   Okay.  I’m going to send out the next exhibit,\n17 Exhibit 3, hopefully.\n18               (Exhibit 3 discussed.)\n19      A.   Okay.\n20      Q    (BY MR. HILTON)  Do you recognize what I’m\n21 marking as Exhibit 3 to the deposition?  It says\n22 Exhibit B on the first page of it, but I’m going to\n23 refer to it as Exhibit 3.\n24      A.   Yes.\n25      Q.   Okay.  And what is Exhibit 3?\nIntegrity Legal Support Solutions\nwww.integrity-texas.com\n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 85   Filed 06/15/20   Page 28 of 100\nDCCC - 4/28/2020\n27\n1      A.   This is a Declaration from Alexander Edelman\n2 in support of the Plaintiff’s motion.\n3      Q.   Who is he?\n4      A.   He’s DCCC’s National Field Director.\n5      Q.   Do you know Mr. Edelman?\n6      A.   I do.\n7      Q.   And how do you know him?\n8      A.   He’s my colleague at the DCCC.\n9      Q.   And can you describe exactly what a National\n10 Field Director does?\n11      A.   Sure.  The National Field Director oversees\n12 the entire field program for the DCCC.\n13      Q.   What is a field program?\n14               MS. BRANCH:  I’m going to object to the\n15 extent that this calls for information that would be\n16 protected by the First Amendment.\n17               But you may answer at a high level.\n18      A.   Sure.  Our field program is geared at\n19 mobilizing and persuading voters, usually directly on\n20 the ground in our targeted districts.\n21      Q.   (BY MR. HILTON)  And how does the field\n22 program go about accomplishing that?\n23      A.   We usually work with coordinated campaigns,\n24 which is a collaboration between national parties and\n25 state parties to elect Democrats up and down the ballot.\nIntegrity Legal Support Solutions\nwww.integrity-texas.com\n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 85   Filed 06/15/20   Page 29 of 100\nDCCC - 4/28/2020\n28\n1 So in Texas we work with the Texas Democratic Party,\n2 along with the other national party committees and, you\n3 know, each state sometimes looks a little bit different;\n4 but usually we are running Get-Out-the-Vote programs,\n5 voter registration programs, engaging our voters\n6 directly on the ground through canvasses.\n7      Q.   And how does the DCCC’s support for that kind\n8 of program play out in practice?  I mean, I guess, is it\n9 just providing funding?  Do you provide manpower as\n10 well, or what other resources do you provide?\n11      A.   Yeah, so it’s all of the above.  We provide\n12 funding.  We transfer money to the State Party to be\n13 used for the Coordinated Campaign.  We also have our own\n14 direct investments in people on the ground in some\n15 cases.  In Texas, for example, we have four offices\n16 opened; and we have staff in those offices.\n17      Q.   All right.  Well, I’m getting a little ahead\n18 of myself.  We’ll get into more details of that later,\n19 but I realize I forgot to ask:  You said -- you\n20 mentioned you reviewed a declaration in connection with\n21 this matter to prepare for the deposition today.  Was\n22 this the declaration you were referring to?\n23      A.   Yes, it was.\n24      Q.   All right.  So we’ll leave that to the side\n25 for now and come back to it.\nIntegrity Legal Support Solutions\nwww.integrity-texas.com\n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 85   Filed 06/15/20   Page 30 of 100\nDCCC - 4/28/2020\n29\n1               (Exhibit 4 discussed.)\n2      Q.   (BY MR. HILTON)  The next group of documents\n3 that I’m going to designate as Exhibit 4 to the\n4 deposition is going to be the DCCC’s production in\n5 response to our subpoena duces tecum.  So that’s Bates\n6 Numbers DCCC 000001 through 805.  Do you have those\n7 documents available to you?\n8      A.   Yes, I do.\n9      Q.   And are you familiar with those documents?\n10      A.   I am.\n11      Q.   Okay.  Did you review all of them before the\n12 deposition today?\n13      A.   Yes.\n14      Q.   How much time did you spend reviewing them?\n15      A.   Probably about an hour.\n16      Q.   Who gathered these documents?\n17               MS. BRANCH:  I’m going to object to the\n18 extent that this calls for conversations between\n19 attorney and client or attorney work product.\n20               MR. HILTON:  It does not.  I’m asking for\n21 an identity of the person who collected the documents.\n22               MS. BRANCH:  You can answer that, Jacqui.\n23      A.   This specific group of documents?\n24      Q    (BY MR.

These came from my counsel.\n2      Q.   But who collected them?\n3      A.   Initially in this process?\n4      Q.   Yeah, who at DCCC gathered the documents for\n5 production?\n6      A.   Staff.  And, I mean, I think several people\n7 collected documents related to this production based\n8 on -- based on the request and the search terms guided\n9 by our counsel.\n10      Q.   What were the search terms?\n11               MS. BRANCH:  Objection, attorney-client\n12 privilege.\n13      Q.   (BY MR. HILTON)  You can answer.\n14               MS. BRANCH:  I’m instructing you not to\n15 answer that.\n16               It’s clearly search terms that we worked\n17 with them and communicated with them to find the\n18 documents.  If there’s specific documents you want to\n19 ask about, I think we can do that; but...\n20               MR. HILTON:  I would like to know the\n21 search terms.  Will you provide them to me, Aria?\n22               MS. BRANCH:  We can talk off the record\n23 about that.\n24               MR.

BRANCH:  I don’t have them in front\n3 of me, but we can discuss that.  They are search terms\n4 that were created based on the subpoena.\n5               MR.

I feel like I\n10 have to ask my question again, Ms. Newman.  What were\n11 the search terms that were used?\n12               MS. BRANCH:  And I’m going to assert the\n13 same objection and instruct the witness not to answer.\n14      Q    (BY MR. HILTON)  Are you going to abide by\n15 that instruction?\n16      A.   Yes, I am.\n17      Q.   Do you know what the search terms are?\n18      A.   Not off the top of my head.\n19      Q.   Did you at one point know what they were?\n20      A.   Yes.\n21      Q.   Did you refer to something else and refresh\n22 your memory as to what the search terms are?\n23      A.   I could refer to my conversations with my\n24 counsel.\n25      Q.   So you could give me the search terms if you\nIntegrity Legal Support Solutions\nwww.integrity-texas.com\n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 85   Filed 06/15/20   Page 33 of 100\nDCCC - 4/28/2020\n32\n1 were required to do so?\n2               MS.

And\n5 I’m trying to question the witness, and you cannot\n6 answer for the witness.\n7      Q.   (BY MR.

Who ran the search terms?\n12      A.   A combination of our staff and our IT\n13 Director.\n14      Q.   And you mentioned earlier as well that several\n15 people assisted in gathering the documents.  Did I\n16 understand your testimony correctly?\n17      A.   Yes.\n18      Q.   What are the names of each person who assisted\n19 in gathering these documents?\n20      A.   I don’t know that information.  I would have\n21 to check.\n22               MR.

So I’m going to ask --\n11               MS. BRANCH:  I think we can have that\n12 conversation.  I don’t think that Jacqui knows; and I\n13 also think that it infringes on the privilege, so.\n14      Q    (BY MR. HILTON)  Well, Ms. Newman, do you know\n15 the identities of the individuals who ran these search\n16 terms?\n17      A.   It’s a wide group, I think.\n18      Q.   Okay.  Do you know the identity of those\n19 individuals in that wide group?\n20      A.   I have it somewhere.  I do not know right now.\n21      Q.   But you could get me that information if you\n22 were required to do is?\n23      A.   I believe so.\n24      Q.   And you mentioned that several people helped\n25 gather the documents.  Were you referring to just\nIntegrity Legal Support Solutions\nwww.integrity-texas.com\n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 85   Filed 06/15/20   Page 35 of 100\nDCCC - 4/28/2020\n34\n1 running the search terms, or was there some other way in\n2 which documents were gathered?\n3               MS. BRANCH:  Again, I think this calls\n4 for attorney-client privileged information in that it\n5 goes to the communications we had on how to formulate\n6 the search for documents.\n7      Q.   (BY MR. HILTON)  I am not asking about the\n8 content of any communication that you or anyone at DCCC\n9 had with your counsel, Ms. Newman.  I want to be very\n10 clear about that.  But I would like to know the method\n11 by which these documents were gathered, and I want\n12 clarity on your earlier testimony.  Earlier you said\n13 that several people helped gather the documents.  Do I\n14 have that correct?\n15      A.   Yes.\n16      Q.   And you also mentioned that there was a wide\n17 group of people who ran search terms.  Do I have that\n18 correct?\n19      A.   I believe so.  Like I said, I would have to\n20 check.\n21      Q.   Okay.  And I want to know:  Is that the same\n22 group you were referring to, or are there two different\n23 groups of individuals that you’re referring to in your\n24 testimony?\n25               MS. BRANCH:  Same objection.  I think\nIntegrity Legal Support Solutions\nwww.integrity-texas.com\n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 85   Filed 06/15/20   Page 36 of 100\nDCCC - 4/28/2020\n35\n1 asked and answered.  She’s answered the question.\n2               MR. HILTON:  With respect, Aria, it has\n3 not been answered.  I want to understand who searched\n4 for what and how, and I’m entitled to that information.\n5      Q.   (BY MR. HILTON)  So Ms. Newman, who -- was\n6 there another method of gathering documents other than\n7 running search terms?\n8               MS. BRANCH:  Again, it’s privileged.  I\n9 mean, these -- what you’re asking -- I understand where\n10 you’re coming from, but what you’re asking is asking for\n11 the content of the communications we had with them in\n12 terms of how to comply with the subpoena.\n13               MR. HILTON:  Can you read back my\n14 question?\n15               MS. BRANCH:  I’m going to instruct the\n16 witness not to answer, and I’m hopeful that we can maybe\n17 move on to another topic.\n18               MR. HILTON:  Can you read back the\n19 question, Debbie, that I asked?  I’d like you to read\n20 the question.\n21               THE REPORTER:  Yes.\n22               (The requested material was read as\n23 follows:\n24               \"QUESTION:  Okay.  And I want to know:\n25 Is that the same group you were referring to, or are\nIntegrity Legal Support Solutions\nwww.integrity-texas.com\n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 85   Filed 06/15/20   Page 37 of 100\nDCCC - 4/28/2020\n36\n1 there two different groups of individuals that you are\n2 referring to in your testimony?\")\n3               MS. BRANCH:  Objection, vague.\n4               You may answer if you are able to.\n5      A.   I don’t really understand the question.\n6      Q    (BY MR. HILTON)  Well, I don’t really\n7 understand your testimony.  You said earlier that there\n8 was a group of -- that there were several people who\n9 gathered documents, correct?  That’s what you first\n10 said?\n11      A.   Well -- and I would like to clarify.  We might\n12 have asked several people.  That does not mean several\n13 people had documents to gather, and I do not know that\n14 information right now.\n15      Q.   All right.  I’m going to ask you one more\n16 time:  Who collected the documents for DCCC?\n17               MS. BRANCH:  Objection, asked and\n18 answered.\n19               You can repeat the same answer.\n20               MR. HILTON:  I would appreciate it, Aria,\n21 if you didn’t instruct your witness how to answer my\n22 questions.  Okay?  That’s a speaking objection.  It’s\n23 not permitted.  You can state the basis of your\n24 objection, and you can either instruct her to answer or\n25 not.\nIntegrity Legal Support Solutions\nwww.integrity-texas.com\n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 85   Filed 06/15/20   Page 38 of 100\nDCCC - 4/28/2020\n37\n1               MS. BRANCH:  I think I’ve done that now.\n2               MR. HILTON:  Debbie, can you please read\n3 back my question?\n4               (The requested material was read as\n5 follows:\n6               \"QUESTION:  I’m going to ask you one more\n7 time:  Who collected the documents for DCCC?\")\n8      A.   We would have requested documents from a group\n9 of staff and our IT Director.\n10      Q    (BY MR. HILTON)  What’s the name of your IT\n11 Director?\n12               MS. BRANCH:  Objection.\n13               MR. HILTON:  What is the basis of your\n14 objection?\n15               MS. BRANCH:  I think this is -- we’re\n16 getting into attorney-client privileged discussions in\n17 terms of preparing for the -- for this.\n18      Q    (BY MR. HILTON)  Ms. Newman, my question is:\n19 What is the name of DCCC’s IT Director?\n20      A.   David Winston.\n21               MR. HILTON:  I just want to, again, make\n22 clear on the record that I think this document\n23 production is insufficient.  We’re going to reserve all\n24 rights to pursue whatever remedies we think we need to.\n25               I’m asking questions that clearly are not\nIntegrity Legal Support Solutions\nwww.integrity-texas.com\n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 85   Filed 06/15/20   Page 39 of 100\nDCCC - 4/28/2020\n38\n1 calling for any privileged information, and you’re\n2 instructing the witness not to answer.  That’s improper.\n3 I believe I’m entitled to the answers to these questions\n4 to understand whether this document collection effort\n5 was sufficient.  Clearly it was not.\n6      Q    (BY MR. HILTON)  Ms. Newman, I apologize.\n7 I’ve gotten a little heated during this part of the\n8 questioning.  I want you to understand I have no quarrel\n9 with you whatsoever.  I’m just trying to get the\n10 information that I need to represent my clients.  And so\n11 I’m trying --\n12               MS. BRANCH:  And I’m happy -- sorry.  I\n13 didn’t mean to cut you off.\n14               MR. HILTON:  Go ahead.\n15               MS. BRANCH:  Well, I’m happy to have, you\n16 know, a further conversation about the document\n17 production.  I do think that several of the requests\n18 infringe upon the First Amendment privilege.  We’ve\n19 produced documents responsive to the requests to the\n20 extent they’re not privileged.  And the client has\n21 stated that they undertook efforts to respond to the\n22 subpoena.\n23               If you want to meet and confer, have a\n24 separate conversation about that, we can off the record.\n25 It’s probably not as fruitful to do with Ms. Newman,\nIntegrity Legal Support Solutions\nwww.integrity-texas.com\n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 85   Filed 06/15/20   Page 40 of 100\nDCCC - 4/28/2020\n39\n1 given that she doesn’t have vision over the entire\n2 process.  And I do think that some of the questions,\n3 when you’re talking about search terms, do infringe upon\n4 communications that we’ve had with our client.\n5               MR. HILTON:  Sorry.  Well, if you can\n6 find a case that says the search terms are going to be\n7 privileged in this context, I’d love to see it.\n8               And I think Ms. Newman testified that she\n9 could answer all these questions if you had properly\n10 prepared her; and clearly, you didn’t.  So, anyway...\n11      Q.   (BY MR. HILTON)  And, again, Ms. Newman,\n12 that’s no point against you.  I just think your\n13 counsel’s not done what they should have done with\n14 respect to the document production, but we’ll move on.\n15               MS. BRANCH:  I think that she’s prepared\n16 for this deposition.  She’s prepared on the topics; and,\n17 you know, we’ve produced her here to answer the\n18 questions on the topics.  And we produced documents\n19 responsive to the extent that they were not privileged.\n20      Q    (BY MR. HILTON)  Did you review any other\n21 documents other than the ones that we’ve already\n22 discussed today in preparation for your deposition,\n23 Ms. Newman?\n24      A.   I don’t believe so.\n25      Q.   Okay.  You mentioned that you met with counsel\nIntegrity Legal Support Solutions\nwww.integrity-texas.com\n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 85   Filed 06/15/20   Page 41 of 100\nDCCC - 4/28/2020\n40\n1 to prepare for this deposition, correct?\n2      A.   Yes.\n3      Q.   When?\n4               MS. BRANCH:  Just -- I’m going to just\n5 assert the objection.\n6               This particular question is not\n7 privileged; but I just want to be clear, Jacqui, that\n8 you don’t have to disclose anything that we discussed.\n9 But you may answer the question.\n10               MR. HILTON:  Ms. Branch, again, please\n11 refrain from speaking objections.  You just spoke\n12 without an objection, and that’s improper.\n13      Q    (BY MR. HILTON)  Ms. Newman, when did you meet\n14 with your attorneys?\n15               MS. BRANCH:  The objection, just for the\n16 record, is attorney-client privilege.\n17               But you may answer to the extent that\n18 you’re not disclosing our communications.\n19      A.   I met with counsel regarding this deposition\n20 yesterday and last week.\n21      Q.   (BY MR. HILTON)  So on two occasions?\n22      A.   Yes.\n23      Q.   How long were those meetings, again, without\n24 disclosing the content?\n25      A.   I think roughly about an hour each.\nIntegrity Legal Support Solutions\nwww.integrity-texas.com\n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 85   Filed 06/15/20   Page 42 of 100\nDCCC - 4/28/2020\n41\n1      Q.   Who was in attendance at those meetings?\n2      A.   My counsel, Aria and Rachel.\n3      Q.   And yourself.  Anyone else?\n4      A.   Yeah, myself.  We met with another member of\n5 my team, too, Alex Edelman.\n6      Q.   That’s the same person who signed that\n7 Declaration that’s Exhibit 3?\n8      A.   Yes.\n9      Q.   Okay.\n10               MR. HILTON:  All right.  I’d like to take\n11 a short break if that’s all right.  I will need about\n12 five minutes; but if y’all want to take a longer break,\n13 that’s fine.\n14               THE WITNESS:  Can we have ten minutes?\n15               MR. HILTON:  Sure.\n16               THE WITNESS:  Thank you.\n17               THE REPORTER:  Going off the record at\n18 11:02 a.m.\n19               (Off the record from 11:02 to 11:14 a.m.)\n20               THE REPORTER:  We’re back on the record\n21 at 11:14 a.m.\n22               MR. HILTON:  And as we’ve done in the\n23 other depositions, I’m fine waiving the additional read-\n24 on every time we go back on, as long as y’all are fine\n25 with that.\nIntegrity Legal Support Solutions\nwww.integrity-texas.com\n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 85   Filed 06/15/20   Page 43 of 100\nDCCC - 4/28/2020\n42\n1               MS. BRANCH:  I’m good.  Thank you.\n2      Q.   (BY MR. HILTON)  Ms. Newman, I, again, just\n3 wanted to, you know, apologize that you had to get\n4 dragged into that discussion between counsel and I.  I\n5 hate to do that kind of stuff in depositions; sometimes\n6 it happens.  But just, you know, I’m going to try and\n7 move on and get through the substance of what I have to\n8 ask you about kind of as painlessly as possible as I\n9 can.\n10               You know, I just want to, again, make\n11 clear that I’m not asking for you to reveal any\n12 privileged information with any of my questions.  Of\n13 course, your counsel will instruct you or object, you\n14 know, as necessary.  But I just want to make that clear.\n15 I’m not intending to ask for privileged information.\n16               So I want to turn back to the DCCC and\n17 just talking about the organization’s background and\n18 activities and that kind of thing.  And I can’t remember\n19 if I asked you this or not before:  When was the DCCC\n20 first established?\n21      A.   It was established over 150 years ago.  I\n22 think it’s 1866.\n23      Q.   Wow.  And has its mission changed over time?\n24      A.   I don’t believe so.\n25      Q.   But electing Democrats is the name of the game\nIntegrity Legal Support Solutions\nwww.integrity-texas.com\n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 85   Filed 06/15/20   Page 44 of 100\nDCCC - 4/28/2020\n43\n1 since 1866?\n2      A.   I think that’s about right.\n3      Q.   We talked a little bit earlier about the\n4 relationship between DCCC and the DNC, and I kind of\n5 want to explore similar issues in relation to an exhibit\n6 that I just sent out in the Zoom chat.  This is\n7 something I found on the FEC’s website.  That’s the\n8 Federal Election Commission.  Are you familiar with the\n9 FEC?\n10      A.   Yes, I am.\n11      Q.   I would imagine that you would be.\n12               (Exhibit 6 discussed.)\n13      Q.   (BY MR. HILTON)  Do you have Exhibit 6 in\n14 front of you?\n15      A.   Yes, I do.\n16      Q.   And do you recognize Exhibit 6?\n17      A.   Yes, I do.\n18      Q.   And what is it?\n19      A.   This is a Statement of Organization filed with\n20 the FEC.\n21      Q.   And I guess before we dig into it, I’m\n22 curious:  Are you responsible for, you know, making sure\n23 that the FEC filings get done?\n24      A.   I am not responsible for those.\n25      Q.   Who has that responsibility?\nIntegrity Legal Support Solutions\nwww.integrity-texas.com\n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 85   Filed 06/15/20   Page 45 of 100\nDCCC - 4/28/2020\n44\n1      A.   Our Chief Financial Officer.\n2      Q.   And who is that?\n3      A.   Jackie Forte-Mackay.\n4      Q.   Yeah, her name pops up on some of this stuff,\n5 I think.  She’s on this one.\n6               Are you familiar with FEC filings for the\n7 DCCC?\n8      A.   Yes, I am.\n9      Q.   Do you review them before they get filed?\n10      A.   I do not.\n11      Q.   How are you familiar with them, then?\n12      A.   I have an awareness -- a top-line awareness of\n13 our filings before they are filed; and if there’s any\n14 questions or concerns, sometimes I am a part of those\n15 conversations.\n16      Q.   So just in the course of your job, you have\n17 occasion to refer to them and work with them?\n18      A.   Yes.\n19      Q.   Did you review any FEC filings before the\n20 deposition today?\n21      A.   I reviewed some of our FEC filings that show\n22 our work in Texas.\n23      Q.   Which filings?\n24      A.   I believe Aria shared these with you; but,\n25 basically, the money that we sent to the Texas\nIntegrity Legal Support Solutions\nwww.integrity-texas.com\n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 85   Filed 06/15/20   Page 46 of 100\nDCCC - 4/28/2020\n45\n1 Democratic Party.\n2      Q.   Well, let’s skip ahead so I don’t lose the\n3 thread of this.  I’m going to send out what I’m marking\n4 as Exhibit 8 to the deposition.  This is an Excel\n5 spreadsheet.\n6               (Exhibit 8 discussed.)\n7      Q    (BY MR. HILTON)  And this was, you know, my\n8 attempt to export the data from the FEC link that your\n9 counsel provided.  So let me know once you have the\n10 spreadsheet open.\n11      A.   Okay.  I have this open.\n12      Q.   I hesitate to ask:  Do you recognize what you\n13 are looking at here in Exhibit 8?\n14      A.   Yes, I do.\n15      Q.   Okay.  And what is this?\n16      A.   This appears to be a document showing\n17 transfers from the Democratic -- or from the DCCC to the\n18 Texas Democratic Party, dating back to 2014.\n19      Q.   Is this the FEC filings that you were\n20 referring to when you said you reviewed some FEC\n21 information prior to the deposition?\n22      A.   Yes, this looks like it.\n23      Q.   There’s another version on the web page that\n24 looks a little better.  I prefer to use this version if\n25 you can manage to work with it because this is the\nIntegrity Legal Support Solutions\nwww.integrity-texas.com\n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 85   Filed 06/15/20   Page 47 of 100\nDCCC - 4/28/2020\n46\n1 version that you get when you export the data from the\n2 FEC; but if it just becomes unworkable, we have that as\n3 an option.  And I can try to do a little screen share.\n4 But, again, this is the data from the link that your\n5 counsel provided to me last night; and is that what it\n6 appears to be to you as well?\n7      A.   Yes.\n8      Q.   Okay.  I think you already said that, but I\n9 just wanted to make that clear.\n10               Since we’re here, I might as well ask you\n11 the questions I have on this document.  What information\n12 can I glean about what the purpose of these funds was\n13 from Exhibit 8?\n14               MS. BRANCH:  Objection, vague.\n15               You may answer the question.\n16      A.   You can learn how much money we transferred to\n17 the Texas Democratic Party and on what dates.\n18      Q.   (BY MR. HILTON)  Can I learn what the funds\n19 were for?\n20      A.   No.\n21      Q.   I can’t learn which activities they supported?\n22               MS. BRANCH:  Objection.\n23      A.   No.\n24      Q    (BY MR. HILTON)  Is there another document\n25 that I could refer to that would allow me to determine\nIntegrity Legal Support Solutions\nwww.integrity-texas.com\n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 85   Filed 06/15/20   Page 48 of 100\nDCCC - 4/28/2020\n47\n1 what these fund transfers were used for?\n2      A.   No.\n3      Q.   So no document exists that would allow me to\n4 determine what any of these fund transfers were used for\n5 in the possession of DCCC?\n6      A.   I mean, our internal budgets and plans may\n7 share information -- or have information related to\n8 these transfers.\n9      Q.   And were those documents produced?\n10               MS. BRANCH:  Objection.  This is\n11 attorney-client privilege, and you’re asking questions\n12 that call for information protected by the First\n13 Amendment privilege.\n14      Q.   (BY MR. HILTON)  I’m not intending to call for\n15 privileged information.  I just want to understand if\n16 the documents that you were just referring to,\n17 Ms. Newman, were included in the production which I’ve\n18 marked as Exhibit 4 to this deposition, Bates Number\n19 DCCC 1 through 805.\n20               MS. BRANCH:  And I think those documents\n21 were privileged.  So whatever she’s referring to, that\n22 would be the reason why they were not produced.\n23               MR. HILTON:  Ms. Branch, I’m sorry.  I’d\n24 like to hear the answer from the witness.\n25      Q.   (BY MR. HILTON)  Ms. Newman, were those\nIntegrity Legal Support Solutions\nwww.integrity-texas.com\n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 85   Filed 06/15/20   Page 49 of 100\nDCCC - 4/28/2020\n48\n1 documents that you were just referring to included in\n2 Bates Number DCCC 1 through 805?\n3      A.   I’m not sure.\n4      Q.   Well, you have those documents in front of\n5 you.  If you want to look through that and see if\n6 they’re in there, you can do that.\n7      A.   Oh, sorry.  They are not in Exhibit 4.\n8      Q.   Okay.  So those documents that would show me\n9 what activities these funds were spent on, those have\n10 not been produced?\n11      A.   That’s my understanding.\n12      Q.   Okay.  And, again, I want you to be sure.  You\n13 have all the documents that were produced in front of\n14 you.  So I would kind of like a definitive answer to\n15 that.\n16               MS. BRANCH:  Objection, asked and\n17 answered.\n18      A.   I don’t believe that they are included in that\n19 document.  They are strategic information and documents\n20 related to our work.\n21      Q    (BY MR. HILTON)  Okay.  So they were not\n22 produced?\n23      A.   Right.\n24      Q.   All right.  I think we are done with\n25 Exhibit 8.\nIntegrity Legal Support Solutions\nwww.integrity-texas.com\n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 85   Filed 06/15/20   Page 50 of 100\nDCCC - 4/28/2020\n49\n1               Can we turn back to Exhibit 6, which is\n2 where I think this digression started?  Do you still\n3 have that in front of you, Ms. Newman?\n4      A.   Yes, I do.\n5      Q.   Had you seen Exhibit -- when was the last time\n6 you’ve seen Exhibit 6, or have you seen Exhibit 6\n7 before?\n8      A.   Yes.  It’s probably been several months since\n9 I’ve seen this.\n10      Q.   Okay.  So you didn’t review it to prepare for\n11 the deposition?\n12      A.   I did not.\n13      Q.   And it has a list of what I’ll refer to as\n14 affiliated committees/organizations.  And each of those\n15 appear to have an affiliated relationship code that\n16 describes them as a joint fundraising representative.\n17 Do I have that about right?\n18      A.   Yes.\n19      Q.   And so can you explain to me what an\n20 affiliated relationship code is and what a joint\n21 fundraising representative is?\n22      A.   Again, I don’t file these reports.  So I’m not\n23 deeply familiar, but I believe an affiliated\n24 relationship code is an FEC term to qualify the\n25 relationship here.  And a joint -- and these are all\nIntegrity Legal Support Solutions\nwww.integrity-texas.com\n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 85   Filed 06/15/20   Page 51 of 100\nDCCC - 4/28/2020\n50\n1 committees that we have joint fundraising committees\n2 with.\n3      Q.   Is that what joint fundraising representative\n4 means?  It means you do joint fundraising activities?\n5      A.   Yes.\n6      Q.   Which of these listed groups relates to\n7 activities in Texas?\n8      A.   The Blue Texas Fund is related to Texas.  It\n9 is possible the New Wave Women’s Fund -- I believe that\n10 also has a Texas connection.\n11      Q.   Any others?\n12      A.   I believe that’s it.  There’s also a chance\n13 the Red to Blue Victory Fund may have a connection to\n14 Texas, but I’m not aware of that at this time.\n15      Q.   Okay.  So sitting here today, you don’t know\n16 for sure whether Red to Blue Victory Fund has a Texas\n17 connection?\n18      A.   Correct.\n19      Q.   But Blue Texas Fund, I assume, does.  And New\n20 Wave Women, you also think has a Texas connection.  Do I\n21 have that about right?\n22      A.   Yes.\n23      Q.   Okay.  Let’s start with Blue Texas Fund.  What\n24 is it?\n25      A.   This is a joint fundraising agreement with\nIntegrity Legal Support Solutions\nwww.integrity-texas.com\n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 85   Filed 06/15/20   Page 52 of 100\nDCCC - 4/28/2020\n51\n1 campaigns in Texas.\n2      Q.   Any campaigns in particular?\n3      A.   I believe the Fletcher campaign in Texas 7 and\n4 the Allred campaign in Texas 32.\n5      Q.   Any others?\n6      A.   I would need to confirm.\n7      Q.   Do you know if that information is reflected\n8 in any of the documents that were produced to us?\n9      A.   Yes, I believe it is.\n10      Q.   All right.  I think -- I think that we will\n11 get there later.  So I think we can leave that for now.\n12               But what activities does the Blue Texas\n13 Fund engage in specifically?\n14      A.   Fundraising.\n15      Q.   And how is that conducted?\n16      A.   I’m sorry.  Could you repeat the question?\n17      Q.   You said Blue Texas Fund, the only activity\n18 you said was fundraising; is that right?\n19      A.   Yes.\n20      Q.   Okay.  No other purpose for Blue Texas Fund?\n21 Nothing else that it does?\n22      A.   Correct.\n23      Q.   And so how does Blue Texas Fund go about its\n24 fundraising activities?\n25               MS.

It’s mostly a direct mail fundraising\n6 campaign.\n7      Q    (BY MR. HILTON)  So sending mail solicitations\n8 to people for donations?\n9      A.   Yes.\n10      Q.   And you said \"mostly.\"  Are you aware of any\n11 other fundraising activities that the Blue Texas Fund\n12 engages in?\n13      A.   No.  I believe it’s direct mail.\n14      Q.   And what’s DCCC’s involvement in those\n15 activities?\n16      A.   We help facilitate the direct mail, the copy,\n17 getting it out.\n18      Q.   I don’t think I understand what you mean by\n19 facilitate and help getting it out.  Can you describe\n20 that a little more specifically?\n21      A.   Sure.\n22               MS.

We -- we work with, you know, whoever else is\n3 in the fund and work on the creative printing and direct\n4 mailing of the mail solicitations.\n5      Q.   (BY MR.

Actual manpower.\n10      Q.   I’m sorry.  Go ahead.\n11      A.   Oh, no.\n12      Q.   And you said you worked with whoever else is\n13 in the fund.  Is that the two campaigns you referred to\n14 earlier?\n15      A.   Yes.\n16      Q.   And then whoever else you can’t recall, but\n17 it’s in the documents?\n18      A.   Yes.\n19      Q.   And the direct mail Blue Texas Fund engages\n20 in, is that purely a solicitation for donations; or is\n21 there anything else that these, you know, mailers are\n22 trying to accomplish?\n23      A.

No.\n2      Q.   And how about New Wave Women, what is -- you\n3 know, what is that?\n4      A.   It’s very similar to the Blue Texas Fund\n5 except it is a joint fundraising agreement highlighting\n6 our frontline women candidates.\n7      Q.   And who is that fundraising agreement with?\n8 Is it also with campaigns in Texas?\n9      A.   Again, I would need to check on who that\n10 agreement is with.  I believe it’s broader than Texas.\n11      Q.   Understood.  You did say that earlier.  You’re\n12 right.\n13               Do you know who the participants from\n14 Texas in the New Wave Women group are?\n15      A.   Again, I would need to check.\n16      Q.   Is that in the document that was produced?\n17      A.   If it is related to Texas, I think it would be\n18 in the production.\n19      Q.   I’m going to pull up a document that I had\n20 prepared to talk about with you, and I want to see if\n21 this is going to show me the information that we’re kind\n22 of circling around here.  So I’m going to send it out\n23 again through the group chat.  This is a portion of\n24 Exhibit 4, which is the document production that was\n25 given to us.  This is a file labeled DCCC 661.  That’s\nIntegrity Legal Support Solutions\nwww.integrity-texas.com\n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 85   Filed 06/15/20   Page 56 of 100\nDCCC - 4/28/2020\n55\n1 the beginning Bates number.  It’s a two-page document.\n2 Let me know when you have that in front of you.\n3      A.   Okay.  I have it open.\n4      Q.   What is this document?\n5      A.   This is a release of our House Majority\n6 Battlefield and the first twelve candidates named to the\n7 DCCC’s Red to Blue program.\n8      Q.   Does this document show the participants in\n9 the Blue Texas Fund or New Wave Women?\n10      A.   No, it does not.\n11      Q.   Okay.  Well, maybe let’s do this, because I\n12 would like to know who in Texas is involved with those\n13 funds.  I’d like to understand the relationships that\n14 DCCC has with affiliates who work in Texas.  And so\n15 maybe the next time that we take a break would be an\n16 appropriate time for you to look through Exhibit 4 and\n17 find those documents that you’re referring to.\n18      A.   Okay.\n19               MS. BRANCH:  Yes, I think we did produce\n20 information on the Blue Texas Fund.  So we can pull up\n21 those documents after the break for sure.\n22               MR. HILTON:  Yeah.  Let’s -- if that’s\n23 all right with y’all, let’s just do that on the next\n24 break.  I’m going to make a note real quick to come back\n25 to that.\nIntegrity Legal Support Solutions\nwww.integrity-texas.com\n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 85   Filed 06/15/20   Page 57 of 100\nDCCC - 4/28/2020\n56\n1      Q.   (BY MR. HILTON)  And, Ms. Newman, if you\n2 happen to, you know, as we’re going through other\n3 stuff -- if you happen to come across these documents as\n4 we’re going through stuff, you know, holler at me; and\n5 we can take care of it right then so we don’t have to\n6 come back to it.\n7      A.   Will do.\n8      Q.   I think that’s all I have for Exhibit 6.\n9               I’m going to move now to Exhibit 7.\n10               (Exhibit 7 discussed.)\n11      Q    (BY MR. HILTON)  I’ve just sent it out via\n12 Zoom chat.  I gave this a file name that I thought it\n13 was, but I actually really don’t know what I’m looking\n14 at here.  So please let me know once you have this in\n15 front of you.  And once you do, if you know, if you\n16 could, tell me what is that we’re looking at here.\n17      A.   Sure.  This appears to be the summary page for\n18 an amended year-end report from the DCCC.\n19      Q.   And are you familiar with these year-end\n20 reports?\n21      A.   Yes.\n22      Q.   Did you review any year-end reports in\n23 preparation for your deposition?\n24      A.   I did not.\n25      Q.   What is your familiarity with these reports?\nIntegrity Legal Support Solutions\nwww.integrity-texas.com\n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 85   Filed 06/15/20   Page 58 of 100\nDCCC - 4/28/2020\n57\n1 Is it similar to the first one we looked at where it\n2 just comes up in the course of your work?\n3      A.   Yes, it is.\n4      Q.   And I don’t mean to speak for you, but any\n5 other differences compared to what we looked at before?\n6 Anything else I should know about your familiarity with\n7 this report?\n8      A.   No.  I mean, we talked about it from a high\n9 level; but I do not review the reports.\n10      Q.   Got it.  And you said this is just a summary\n11 page.  Do you know what other information is included\n12 with these forms, these reports?\n13      A.   Yes.  So this is the summary, the overview of\n14 mostly cash on hand, total money in, and total money\n15 out.  And then on the FEC website itself, you would be\n16 able to click through these filings and see all of the\n17 receipts and disbursements itemized.  And at least with\n18 the disbursements, that also shows, like, the vendor and\n19 a purpose.\n20      Q.   So on page 1 of Exhibit 7, there are some\n21 links there.  It says, \"Summary Page, Detailed Summary\n22 Page.\"  And then describes Schedule A, B, and D filings.\n23 Are those the attachments to the schedules that you’re\n24 referring to?\n25      A.   Yes.\nIntegrity Legal Support Solutions\nwww.integrity-texas.com\n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 85   Filed 06/15/20   Page 59 of 100\nDCCC - 4/28/2020\n58\n1      Q.   And I did not include those in Exhibit 7.\n2 That’s not my normal practice; but when I tried to\n3 download them all, it was something like almost 50,000\n4 pages.  So I don’t intend to go through 50,000 pages\n5 with you today; but, you know, what I’m -- I’m hoping\n6 maybe you can tell me if I were to look at the itemized\n7 disbursements in Schedule B, you mentioned that it\n8 included the description of the purpose for the\n9 disbursement.  Did I hear you correctly?\n10      A.   Yes.\n11      Q.   And what -- can you give me an example of what\n12 that might look like?\n13      A.   Yes.  So for all the disbursements, it usually\n14 shows who the expense is disbursed to, what the vendor\n15 name is, the date of the disbursement; and then there is\n16 an amount related to that expense, as well as a\n17 description for the expense itself.\n18      Q.   Well, what kind of information will be\n19 contained in the description field or maybe --\n20               MS. BRANCH:  I’m going to object on the\n21 basis that this is all public, and the documents speak\n22 for themselves.\n23               You may answer to the extent that you can\n24 describe this.\n25      A.   Sure.  I mean, it depends on the expense; but\nIntegrity Legal Support Solutions\nwww.integrity-texas.com\n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 85   Filed 06/15/20   Page 60 of 100\nDCCC - 4/28/2020\n59\n1 it’s usually a general descriptor.  So if it’s office\n2 space, it might say \"rent.\"  If it’s, you know,\n3 staples.com, it would say \"office supplies.\"\n4      Q.   (BY MR. HILTON)  But -- okay.  That’s helpful.\n5 That’s what I assumed that it was going to be, kind of a\n6 high level of detail; and that’s what it sounds like\n7 you’re describing.  It sounds like if I look at those\n8 Schedule B filings, it will not tell me, you know,\n9 \"Funds spent in Bexar County related to voter\n10 registration efforts in Precinct 3\"?  It won’t be that\n11 level of detail; is that right?\n12               MS. BRANCH:  Objection, public\n13 information.  The document speaks for itself.\n14               You may answer.\n15      A.   Yes, I would agree with that.\n16      Q    (BY MR. HILTON)  Okay.  I’d like to focus\n17 on -- turn back to Exhibit 7.  I’d like to focus on\n18 page 2 in the disbursements section.\n19      A.   Yes.\n20      Q.   What I was hoping you could do for me is\n21 explain to me what each of these types of disbursements\n22 are.  It sounds like, you know, dealing with these\n23 filings and putting them together is not your primary\n24 job duty.  So, you know, to the extent that you can, if\n25 you have an understanding of any of these categories,\nIntegrity Legal Support Solutions\nwww.integrity-texas.com\n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 85   Filed 06/15/20   Page 61 of 100\nDCCC - 4/28/2020\n60\n1 I’d like to know what your understanding is.\n2               MS. BRANCH:  And I’m just going to object\n3 to the extent that this calls for a legal conclusion\n4 since some of these are legal terms.\n5               Jacqui, you may answer.\n6               MR. HILTON:  And, again, I think it’s\n7 going to go smoother if you could just limit the\n8 speaking objections.  I’d appreciate it.\n9      A.   Yeah, I’m happy to share my non-expert opinion\n10 on these.  So each line item the FEC calls for relates\n11 to a slightly different kind of expenditure.  Line 21 is\n12 our operating expenditures; 22 are transfers to\n13 affiliated or other party committees.  So, actually,\n14 what you see in Column A, the 45,360 number, that is\n15 money that we transferred to Texas at the end of the\n16 year, to the Texas Democratic Party.  And any money we\n17 transfer to party committees would show up on that line\n18 item.  Twenty-three is contributions to federal\n19 candidates or other party -- or other political --\n20      Q.   (BY MR. HILTON)  I’m sorry.  I had a question\n21 for you on 22 there.\n22      A.   Sure.\n23      Q.   I’m looking at Column A.  It’s 45,360.  You\n24 said that represented funds transferred to the Texas\n25 Democratic Party?\nIntegrity Legal Support Solutions\nwww.integrity-texas.com\n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 85   Filed 06/15/20   Page 62 of 100\nDCCC - 4/28/2020\n61\n1      A.   Yes.\n2      Q.   And how do you know that?\n3      A.   Well, it’s -- usually, we don’t transfer a lot\n4 of money in the off year.  And so I’m aware that we had\n5 transferred money to Texas in December, and I also came\n6 across that again in preparation for that -- for this\n7 deposition.\n8      Q.   Okay.  And so there are two columns here.  One\n9 of them says, \"Column A, This Period.\"  And that’s where\n10 the 45,360 appears.  There’s also Column B that says,\n11 \"Calendar Year.\"  And that number’s quite a bit higher,\n12 885,821.16.  Do you see that?\n13      A.   Yes.\n14      Q.   What’s the difference between those two\n15 numbers?\n16      A.   Column B refers to amounts that were filed in\n17 previous reports.  So it’s the total amount that we\n18 transferred that calendar -- in 2019.  And we had\n19 transferred the 45,360, I believe, in December, which\n20 was the report filing in question for this time.\n21      Q.   Oh, okay.  So this is -- what I’ve given you,\n22 I think, is the second amended year-end report.  I\n23 guess -- tell me if I have this correctly -- Column B\n24 would be the total of transfers to affiliated or other\n25 party committees that appear on all of the year-end\nIntegrity Legal Support Solutions\nwww.integrity-texas.com\n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 85   Filed 06/15/20   Page 63 of 100\nDCCC - 4/28/2020\n62\n1 reports then?\n2      A.   Yes.  It’s the total we transferred to other\n3 party committees in the year 2019.\n4      Q.   Okay.  Okay.  And you just happen to know that\n5 this 45,360 was the Texas Democratic Party because of\n6 the timing, and you just happen to know?\n7               MS. BRANCH:  Objection.  This is all\n8 public.\n9      A.   Yes.  And in Exhibit 8 that you shared\n10 earlier, you can see that transfer as well.\n11      Q.   (BY MR. HILTON)  Okay.  Great.  That’s\n12 helpful.\n13               But I wouldn’t be able to tell that from\n14 the face of Exhibit 7?\n15      A.   No.\n16               MS. BRANCH:  Objection.  Vague.\n17      Q    (BY MR. HILTON)  Let’s go down to -- all\n18 right.  Well, let’s -- sorry to interrupt you again\n19 there; but that was helpful to help me understand the\n20 difference between Column A and Column B here.\n21               Can you -- I guess we were on Line 23\n22 then; and maybe you could pick back up with, you know,\n23 explaining to me what these -- your categories of\n24 disbursement are.\n25      A.   So Line 23 is contributions to federal\nIntegrity Legal Support Solutions\nwww.integrity-texas.com\n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 85   Filed 06/15/20   Page 64 of 100\nDCCC - 4/28/2020\n63\n1 candidates or other political committees.\n2               Twenty-four would show any disbursements\n3 we made that are considered to be independent\n4 expenditures.\n5      Q.   And what does that mean?\n6      A.   An independent expenditure is an expenditure\n7 that’s made kind of without any coordination.  So those\n8 are expenses that would not be working directly with a\n9 campaign or another party.\n10      Q.   Could it be an expenditure related to a\n11 campaign?\n12      A.   Yes.\n13               MS.

HILTON)  So if you -- this is a\n18 hypothetical example; I don’t know whether it’s\n19 happened -- but if DCCC wanted to run ads in support of,\n20 you know, Wendy Davis in her campaign and didn’t\n21 coordinate with that campaign prior to running the ads,\n22 just kind of did it on its own, would that be an\n23 independent expenditure?\n24               MS.

In a very simple view, yes.  It’s a little bit\n3 more complicated than that because it requires us to\n4 meet certain standards to prove that we haven’t\n5 coordinated with the campaign.  We’re not using any\n6 campaign information.\n7      Q    (BY MR. HILTON)  Yeah, understood.  When\n8 lawyers are involved, it’s never going to be that\n9 simple.  So I get that.  But that’s helpful to help me\n10 kind of understand what we’re looking at.\n11               All right.  So that was 24, independent\n12 expenditures.  How about 25?\n13      A.   This is coordinated expenditures made by a\n14 party committee, so that’s almost the opposite of an\n15 independent expenditure.\n16      Q.   Sure.\n17      A.   Twenty-six is loan repayments made.\n18 Twenty-seven is --\n19      Q.   Is that 16 million on loan repayments made?\n20      A.   Yes.\n21      Q.   And what was that payment?\n22               MS. BRANCH:  Objection to the extent that\n23 this calls for information privileged by the First\n24 Amendment.\n25               But if you can answer that without\nIntegrity Legal Support Solutions\nwww.integrity-texas.com\n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 85   Filed 06/15/20   Page 66 of 100\nDCCC - 4/28/2020\n65\n1 revealing strategic information, you may do so.\n2      A.   As you can see in the publicly available\n3 findings -- or filings, the DCCC took a line of credit\n4 for $16 million.\n5      Q.   From who?\n6      A.   Bank of America.\n7      Q.   And what were those funds used for?\n8               MS. BRANCH:  Objection, same one.\n9               You can answer at a high level.\n10      A.   Our expenditures.\n11      Q    (BY MR. HILTON)  Which expenditures?\n12      A.   Just generally.\n13      Q.   Can you give me an example?\n14      A.   Well, this loan was taken in the 2018 cycle,\n15 so it was for expenditures that occurred in 2018.\n16      Q.   So, like what?\n17               MS. BRANCH:  Objection to the extent that\n18 this calls for strategic information.  I don’t know the\n19 relevance.  Is there a specific relation to this case on\n20 this question?\n21               MR. HILTON:  I would like to know an\n22 example of what this money was spent on in the 2018\n23 campaign.\n24               MS. BRANCH:  Okay.  I think the fact that\n25 they took out a loan is public, but I instruct the\nIntegrity Legal Support Solutions\nwww.integrity-texas.com\n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 85   Filed 06/15/20   Page 67 of 100\nDCCC - 4/28/2020\n66\n1 witness not to answer specific information about what\n2 the loan was used for.\n3               MR.

BRANCH:  I think you can answer at a\n8 high level, Jacqui.\n9               I think she’s already done that, but...\n10      Q    (BY MR. HILTON)  I just want to know an\n11 example of an expenditure that came from the $16 million\n12 during the 2018 campaign.\n13      A.   Yeah, we -- I definitely can’t point to, like,\n14 \"This expense was paid for by this loan.\"  It’s kind of\n15 all of our activities and expenditures grouped together.\n16      Q.   I don’t understand.\n17               MS. BRANCH:  Is there a question?\n18      Q.   (BY MR. HILTON)  Can you please elaborate on\n19 your answer because I don’t understand?\n20      A.   I would just say the loan generally applied to\n21 our activities in the 2018 cycle.\n22      Q.   So --\n23      A.   There’s not a specific expense.\n24      Q.   So it was a 16-million-dollar line of credit,\n25 you said?\nIntegrity Legal Support Solutions\nwww.integrity-texas.com\n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 85   Filed 06/15/20   Page 68 of 100\nDCCC - 4/28/2020\n67\n1      A.   Yes.\n2      Q.   And my understanding of how lines of credit\n3 work -- maybe this one is different -- is that you have\n4 to make the decision to draw down on that line of\n5 credit, correct?\n6      A.   Yes.\n7      Q.   It’s not like Bank of America just handed you\n8 a check for $16 million; and it got thrown into a common\n9 account, correct?\n10      A.   Correct.\n11      Q.   Okay.  So can you give me an example of when\n12 the DCCC -- let’s do it this way:  How about an example\n13 from an expenditure that was made in Texas from this\n14 line of credit?\n15               MS. BRANCH:  Again, same objection on the\n16 First Amendment.\n17               But, Jacqui, you can talk about the 2018\n18 spending in Texas at a high level.\n19      A.   Sure.  Well, we, the DCCC, invested over\n20 $6.7 million in Texas in the 2018 cycle.  Again, I can’t\n21 point to any expense that this loan went directly to\n22 fund other than to say it allowed us to complete all of\n23 our activities in 2018.\n24      Q.   (BY MR. HILTON)  Who would know how this line\n25 of credit was used?\nIntegrity Legal Support Solutions\nwww.integrity-texas.com\n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 85   Filed 06/15/20   Page 69 of 100\nDCCC - 4/28/2020\n68\n1               MS.

Yes, I am.\n6      Q.   You mentioned DCCC has a CFO?\n7      A.   Yes.\n8      Q.   What’s that person’s name?\n9               MS.

HILTON:  Ms. Branch, please limit\n14 your speaking objections.\n15      Q.   (BY MR. HILTON)  I would like to know the name\n16 of the CFO of the DCCC.\n17      A.   Jackie Forte-Mackay.\n18      Q.   Would she know how this expenditure was used,\n19 how this line of credit was used?\n20               MS. BRANCH:  Objection, First Amendment.\n21 Vague.  I’m going to instruct the witness not to answer.\n22 Again, the strategic decisionmaking of the DCCC and use\n23 of that loan is protected by the First Amendment; and\n24 the witness is not going to answer further questions on\n25 that.\nIntegrity Legal Support Solutions\nwww.integrity-texas.com\n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 85   Filed 06/15/20   Page 70 of 100\nDCCC - 4/28/2020\n69\n1               So we can keep objecting and you can take\n2 offense to my speaking objections, but I’m going to put\n3 that on the record and I want that to be clear.  I also\n4 want to make clear on the record that your tone earlier\n5 with respect to my objection and then cutting me off has\n6 been hostile.  So I want that to be reflected.\n7               But, again, I’m going to continue to make\n8 that objection; and we can kind of do that all day.  I\n9 don’t think it’s directly relevant to the DCCC’s\n10 standing, but we can proceed.\n11               MR.

HILTON:  And, Ms. Branch, again, I’m\n19 not offended by your speaking objections; but they’re\n20 not permissible under the rules.  And so I’d just ask\n21 you to limit them.\n22               MS. BRANCH:  I’m trying to limit them as\n23 much as possible, and I understand.  I don’t want to\n24 testify.  Jacqui’s here to testify.\n25               MR.

No.  No, because Exhibit 7 is showing our 2019\n6 year-end report.\n7      Q.   If we were to look at the same form for 2018,\n8 the year-end, you know, report, would that show the\n9 expenditures in Texas?\n10               MS. BRANCH:  Objection.  Public.\n11               But you can answer to the extent that you\n12 know.  It’s all published information.\n13      A.   It would show all of the money that we\n14 transferred to State Party committees and other\n15 expenditures made at a general level.\n16      Q.   (BY MR.

Yes, and you would have to look at all of the\n20 reports, probably.\n21      Q.   Okay.  Did you look at any of those reports in\n22 preparation for your deposition?\n23      A.   I did not.\n24      Q.   And I’m so sorry.

It was used for persuasion and mobilization of\n9 voters in support of our campaigns in Texas.\n10      Q.   Voter persuasion and mobilization of\n11 campaigns?\n12               MS.

Yes.\n18      Q.   Is that what you said?\n19      A.   Yes.\n20      Q.   Is that what you said?  I just didn’t hear it.\n21      A.   Yes.\n22      Q.   Anything else that it was used for?\n23      A.   I think that encompasses a lot of activities,\n24 but...\n25      Q.   Are there any other types of activities that\nIntegrity Legal Support Solutions\nwww.integrity-texas.com\n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 85   Filed 06/15/20   Page 73 of 100\nDCCC - 4/28/2020\n72\n1 that doesn’t encompass?\n2               MS. BRANCH:  Objection, vague.\n3               You may answer.\n4      A.   You know, again, I think everything is --\n5 everything we do is to an end of mobilizing and\n6 persuading voters.\n7      Q    (BY MR. HILTON)  I’m going to ask you to pull\n8 up Exhibit 1, which was sent out earlier.  It’s the\n9 Deposition Notice, and I’d like to turn to page 5 of the\n10 Notice.\n11      A.   Okay.\n12      Q.   And I’m looking at Topic 4, section --\n13 subsection (b).  And starting with the year 2014, what\n14 were the total funds spent on voter persuasion efforts\n15 in Texas during the year 2014?\n16      A.   So I looked into our spending in the past\n17 cycles and I can share with you what we’ve spent in\n18 Texas, but this doesn’t necessarily align with how we\n19 track or know our spending.\n20      Q.   How do you track your spending?\n21      A.   It’s more general than this because, again,\n22 we’re kind of thinking of everything in terms of\n23 everything is a voter persuasion effort or GOTV effort.\n24      Q.   So the entirety of the 6.8 million, or\n25 whatever the number was that you spent in Texas in 2018,\nIntegrity Legal Support Solutions\nwww.integrity-texas.com\n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 85   Filed 06/15/20   Page 74 of 100\nDCCC - 4/28/2020\n73\n1 for example, that was all spent on voter persuasion and\n2 Get Out the Vote?\n3      A.   Yes.\n4      Q.   What about voter registration efforts, can you\n5 break that out?\n6      A.   For past cycles I cannot.\n7      Q.   That relates to 2014 through 2019, I suppose?\n8      A.   Through 2018.  I can speak to our voter\n9 registration efforts this cycle.\n10      Q.   Well, let’s leave this cycle aside for a\n11 second; and let’s stick on the past ones then.  So what\n12 were the total funds spent on all activities in Texas in\n13 the year 2014?\n14      A.   It was just over $3.1 million.\n15      Q.   And that was all spent on voter persuasion and\n16 Get-Out-the-Vote efforts?\n17      A.   Yes.\n18      Q.   And you can’t tell me what portion was spent\n19 on voter registration efforts?\n20      A.   Correct.\n21               MS. BRANCH:  Objection.  She’s asked and\n22 answered.  To the extent that these questions call for\n23 strategic information, I’m going to object on the basis\n24 of the First Amendment.\n25               But you may answer at a high level.\nIntegrity Legal Support Solutions\nwww.integrity-texas.com\n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 85   Filed 06/15/20   Page 75 of 100\nDCCC - 4/28/2020\n74\n1      Q.   (BY MR. HILTON)  Are there any activities\n2 other than voter persuasion, Get Out the Vote, or voter\n3 registration activities on which DCCC spent money in\n4 2014?\n5      A.   In Texas?\n6      Q.   In Texas.\n7      A.   Not to my knowledge.\n8      Q.   How about the year 2015, what was the total\n9 amount of funds spent on all activities in Texas?\n10               MS. BRANCH:  Same objection.\n11               But you may answer at a high level.\n12               First Amendment.\n13               MR. HILTON:  I’m sorry.  What’s the\n14 objection?\n15               MS. BRANCH:  First Amendment.\n16               You may answer at a high level.\n17               I think the witness --\n18      Q.   (BY MR. HILTON)  The question is the total\n19 funds spent on all activities in Texas in the year 2015.\n20      A.   So we -- and I apologize if I didn’t mention\n21 this earlier.  We look at all of our spending on a\n22 cyclical basis.  So the years 2015 and 2016 would be\n23 grouped together.  So I don’t know exactly how much we\n24 spent in 2015.  I would actually guess it’s little to\n25 nothing, just because it’s the off year; and most of our\nIntegrity Legal Support Solutions\nwww.integrity-texas.com\n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 85   Filed 06/15/20   Page 76 of 100\nDCCC - 4/28/2020\n75\n1 spending is in the on year.  But I can tell you in 2016\n2 the DCCC spent just over $6 million in Texas.\n3      Q.   And you did mention the two-year cyclical\n4 nature earlier, and now it’s starting to make a little\n5 more sense.  What kind of activities and expenditures do\n6 occur in the off year?\n7               MS. BRANCH:  Objection to the extent it\n8 calls for First Amendment privileged information.\n9               You may answer at a high level.\n10      A.   It’s generally limited; but if coordinated\n11 campaigns are beginning to get set up, there might be\n12 Coordinated Campaign expenses we’re transferring to the\n13 Party.  Voter registration may begin in an off year.\n14 That is usually it.  The bulk of our spending takes\n15 place in the on year, usually, as we get closer in to\n16 the election.\n17      Q.   (BY MR. HILTON)  Are you withholding\n18 information in your answer based on your instruction\n19 from counsel?\n20               MS. BRANCH:  Objection.\n21               You may answer.\n22               MR. HILTON:  What’s the basis?\n23               MS. BRANCH:  Attorney-client privilege.\n24 I mean, she answered on the record.  You asked her\n25 earlier.\nIntegrity Legal Support Solutions\nwww.integrity-texas.com\n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 85   Filed 06/15/20   Page 77 of 100\nDCCC - 4/28/2020\n76\n1      Q.   (BY MR. HILTON)  Let me explain my question a\n2 little more.  Your counsel instructed you -- objected on\n3 the basis of a First Amendment privilege and stated that\n4 you could answer to the extent it doesn’t reveal\n5 privileged information and that you could answer at a\n6 high level.\n7               MR. HILTON:  Is that a fair\n8 characterization of your objection, Ms. Branch?\n9               MS. BRANCH:  It is.\n10      Q.   (BY MR. HILTON)  Okay.  You heard that\n11 objection, Ms. Newman?\n12      A.   I did.\n13      Q.   And did your answer change on the basis of\n14 that objection?\n15      A.   It did not.\n16      Q.   So you would have given me the same answer\n17 regardless of whether your counsel objected?\n18      A.   Yes.\n19      Q.   Okay.  That’s all I’m asking.  I just want to\n20 know if there actually is something being withheld when\n21 your counsel makes these objections, or not.  So that’s\n22 all I was trying to ask.  Thank you for clarifying that.\n23               All right.  So let’s go back to the\n24 questions from the topics, and we’re dealing with this\n25 is in the two-year cycles; that’s how y’all account for\nIntegrity Legal Support Solutions\nwww.integrity-texas.com\n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 85   Filed 06/15/20   Page 78 of 100\nDCCC - 4/28/2020\n77\n1 it.  And so in the 2016 election cycle, you spent just\n2 over 6 million on all activities in Texas.  Do I\n3 remember that correctly?\n4      A.   Yes, that’s correct.\n5      Q.   What was the total amount spent on voter\n6 persuasion efforts in that election cycle?\n7      A.   Similar to what I said before.  It is all kind\n8 of part of the same bucket of voter persuasion/GOTV\n9 efforts.\n10      Q.   And how much was spent on voter registration\n11 efforts?\n12      A.   I can’t speak to that.\n13      Q.   Is that because you don’t know?\n14      A.   Yes.\n15      Q.   And that’s because DCCC doesn’t track that\n16 information?\n17      A.   Yes, it has not been tracked like this in the\n18 past.\n19      Q.   Are there any other, you know, broad\n20 categories or buckets of activities other than voter\n21 persuasion, Get Out the Vote, and voter registration\n22 efforts on which DCCC spent money in the 2016 election\n23 cycle?\n24      A.   Spent money in general or spent money in\n25 Texas?\nIntegrity Legal Support Solutions\nwww.integrity-texas.com\n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 85   Filed 06/15/20   Page 79 of 100\nDCCC - 4/28/2020\n78\n1      Q.   I’m sorry.  In Texas.\n2      A.   No, it’s just this.\n3      Q.   Okay.  How about the 2018 election cycle?  So\n4 I understand that to mean from the -- you know, the\n5 presidential election in 2016 to the presidential\n6 election in or -- I’m sorry -- for the federal election,\n7 the congressional election in 2016, to the congressional\n8 election in 2018.  That’s how I’m thinking of the\n9 two-year cycle.  Is that how y’all measure it as well?\n10      A.   Yeah, more or less.  I mean, we kind of\n11 started at January 1st.\n12      Q.   Okay.  So it would be -- it’s really the\n13 calendar years 2017 and 2018?\n14      A.   Yeah.\n15      Q.   Okay.  So for that period, 2017 to 2018, or\n16 the 2018 election cycle, what was the total amount spent\n17 on all activities in Texas?\n18      A.   It was over $6.7 million.\n19      Q.   And how much of that was spent on voter\n20 persuasion efforts?\n21      A.   Again, it’s -- that 6.7 covers all of our\n22 voter persuasion and GOTV efforts in the 2018 cycle.\n23      Q.   And how much of that just over 6.7 million, I\n24 think you said, was spent on voter registration efforts?\n25      A.   I don’t know.\nIntegrity Legal Support Solutions\nwww.integrity-texas.com\n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 85   Filed 06/15/20   Page 80 of 100\nDCCC - 4/28/2020\n79\n1      Q.   And that’s because DCCC doesn’t have that\n2 information?\n3      A.   Yeah.  And I’m not being deliberately vague\n4 here.  It’s most likely -- you know, we kind of see it\n5 all as one bucket of money that is going towards this\n6 cause; and we are, as mentioned before, transferring\n7 money to the Texas Democratic Party for the Coordinated\n8 Campaign where a lot of those voter registration efforts\n9 are taking place.\n10      Q.   And I’m not making a judgment as to whether\n11 you should or should not have this information or how\n12 you track it.  I understand, you know, how y’all view\n13 it.  It seems like it’s all one bucket of activity that\n14 goes towards electing Democrats for the House, right?\n15               MS. BRANCH:  Objection, mischaracterizes\n16 the testimony.  I think you should let the witness\n17 testify, so.\n18      Q.   (BY MR. HILTON)  Is that a fair\n19 characterization of your testimony?\n20      A.   Yes, I think generally that’s it.\n21      Q.   Okay.  So I think we’ve finished 2018.\n22               How about the current election cycle,\n23 what’s the total amount that’s been spent so far in the\n24 current election cycle?\n25      A.   So, so far this cycle, we’ve spent -- and you\nIntegrity Legal Support Solutions\nwww.integrity-texas.com\n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 85   Filed 06/15/20   Page 81 of 100\nDCCC - 4/28/2020\n80\n1 can see this in -- I think, it’s Exhibit 8, our\n2 transfers to the Texas Democratic Party.  We’ve\n3 transferred over $145,000 to the Texas Democratic Party.\n4 The DCCC has spent directly in Texas over $1.1 million,\n5 and I believe over $550,000 of that is directly related\n6 to voter registration in Texas.\n7      Q.   $550,000 of what has been spent so far is\n8 related to voter registration?\n9      A.   Yes.\n10      Q.   And how do you know that?\n11      A.   Because we have been working with the Texas\n12 Democratic Party on voter registration, and we have --\n13 directly, the DCCC has engaged in voter registration on\n14 the ground.  And I believe there -- I believe we have\n15 produced documents showing that commitment, but...\n16      Q.   So I guess my question is:  In previous\n17 election cycles, DCCC can’t separate out exactly what\n18 was spent on voter registration; but for the current\n19 election cycle, you can.  And I’m trying to understand\n20 why that’s the case.\n21      A.   Sure.  Well, I mean, one, I think there is a\n22 large voter registration effort in Texas right now in\n23 particular; and so it’s easy for us to identify that.\n24 You know, as I mentioned earlier, we have a lot of\n25 turnover each cycle; and so a lot of the people behind\nIntegrity Legal Support Solutions\nwww.integrity-texas.com\n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 85   Filed 06/15/20   Page 82 of 100\nDCCC - 4/28/2020\n81\n1 spending decisions from past cycles aren’t here to speak\n2 to how we spent money in the past.  And, you know, I’ve\n3 directly been involved with some of these transactions\n4 and expenses, so I can speak to them.\n5      Q.   And how are you able to get such a precise\n6 number for this year’s expenditures on voter\n7 registration efforts?\n8      A.   On the voter registration efforts?\n9      Q.   Yes.\n10      A.   Well, the 145K that we have transferred to the\n11 Texas Democratic Party to date, that has all been to the\n12 Coordinated Campaign to support voter registration and\n13 then what we -- what I know we have spent on voter\n14 registration.\n15      Q.   Do you make any other transfers to any\n16 other -- does DCCC make any other transfers to any other\n17 groups for voter registration activities?\n18      A.   To other state parties?\n19      Q.   Any other groups in Texas.  I’m sorry.  And\n20 I’m doing a poor job of clarifying that, so I appreciate\n21 you noting that.  I’m trying to ask about activities in\n22 Texas.\n23      A.   To my knowledge, we have transferred the money\n24 to the Texas Democratic Party’s Coordinated Campaign for\n25 voter registration and, again, we have engaged a vendor\nIntegrity Legal Support Solutions\nwww.integrity-texas.com\n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 85   Filed 06/15/20   Page 83 of 100\nDCCC - 4/28/2020\n82\n1 ourselves to do voter registration efforts on the ground\n2 in Texas.\n3      Q.   I think that was mentioned in your colleague’s\n4 Declaration, the vendor, if I remember that correctly.\n5 That’s Exhibit 3.\n6      A.   Yes.\n7      Q.   And it looks like that’s Paragraph 7 of the\n8 Declaration in Exhibit 3?\n9      A.   Yes.\n10      Q.   Agreement for nearly $400,000 for a consultant\n11 to provide voter registration services in Texas\n12 Congressional District 23.  That’s what you’re referring\n13 to?\n14      A.   Yes.\n15      Q.   And so what services is that consultant going\n16 to provide?\n17               MS. BRANCH:  Objection to the extent that\n18 this calls for strategic party information.\n19               You may answer at a high level.\n20      A.   They help us go through our process of\n21 training staff on the ground to try to learn how to\n22 register people to vote in Texas.\n23      Q.   (BY MR. HILTON)  And what does that training\n24 look like?\n25      A.   I am not very familiar on the details, but I\nIntegrity Legal Support Solutions\nwww.integrity-texas.com\n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 85   Filed 06/15/20   Page 84 of 100\nDCCC - 4/28/2020\n83\n1 know that all -- anyone who is registering voters in\n2 Texas needs to be trained and deputized in order to do\n3 so.\n4      Q.   And who are the staff that you are training,\n5 like staff of whom?\n6      A.   So it depends, I think.  You know, we hired a\n7 consultant who ran some of these efforts that’s laid out\n8 in Exhibit 3.  In that case the consultant has employees\n9 who are helping this effort in Texas.\n10               We have -- with the money that we have\n11 sent to the Texas Democratic Party, I believe at least\n12 two people have been hired with the express purpose of\n13 assisting voter registration efforts.\n14               And then we also have staff on the ground\n15 who work directly for the DCCC whose roles involve a lot\n16 of community engagement and help with voter\n17 registration.\n18      Q.   Do you know what -- so community engagement\n19 and voter registration, are those two different things?\n20      A.   I think so.  I think maybe community\n21 engagement is an overarching bucket that could involve\n22 voter registration.\n23      Q.   What are the other types of buckets of\n24 activities that your direct staff in Texas are engaging\n25 in this cycle?\nIntegrity Legal Support Solutions\nwww.integrity-texas.com\n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 85   Filed 06/15/20   Page 85 of 100\nDCCC - 4/28/2020\n84\n1      A.   They’re organizing events.  They are meeting\n2 with our constituents in the districts.  They are\n3 following events of our challengers, as well, and\n4 reporting back to the team on what’s happening on the\n5 ground in Texas.\n6      Q.   Anything else?\n7      A.   I think that’s the bulk of it.\n8      Q.   Do you know what percentage of their time is\n9 devoted to voter registration efforts?\n10      A.   I don’t.\n11      Q.   Does anyone at DCCC?\n12      A.   I think our field team would.  I also think it\n13 probably shifts throughout the cycle.  You know, early\n14 on, when there is time to register voters, that is a\n15 bigger focus.  I also think that we would be doing a lot\n16 of voter registration right now if we were not in the\n17 current situation we are in, speaking from our homes.\n18      Q.   Yeah.  Yeah, I can only imagine how much that\n19 has kind of thrown a wrench in everything.  And so,\n20 yeah.\n21               Well, let me ask you this:  Turning back\n22 to Exhibit 3, Paragraph 6, the last sentence of that,\n23 the second sentence of that paragraph, it says, \"DCCC\n24 uses voter registration not only to expand the pool of\n25 individuals who are eligible to vote for Democratic\nIntegrity Legal Support Solutions\nwww.integrity-texas.com\n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 85   Filed 06/15/20   Page 86 of 100\nDCCC - 4/28/2020\n85\n1 candidates but also to have important conversations with\n2 people about the importance of voting and important\n3 causes to the Democratic Party.\"  Did I read that\n4 correctly?\n5      A.   Yes.\n6      Q.   Can you explain what is meant by this?\n7      A.   Sure.  I think in the process of registering\n8 people to vote, people who are not currently registered\n9 or participating in the voting process, it allows you to\n10 start a dialogue about why it’s important for people to\n11 register and to show up and make a plan about voting on\n12 Election Day, which is what getting out the vote is all\n13 about.\n14      Q.   And how about important causes to the\n15 Democratic Party?  How does that piece of it play into\n16 these voter registration efforts?\n17      A.   I think that usually the important causes tie\n18 back to what somebody’s motivation might be to vote.\n19      Q.   How do all of these purposes get accomplished\n20 when you’re engaging in efforts to register voters?\n21      A.   I’m sorry.  Could you clarify the question?\n22      Q.   Well, it seems to me there’s a few different\n23 purposes to DCCC’s voter registration efforts, as\n24 explained in Paragraph 6 of Exhibit 3.  And as you’re\n25 explaining to me now, it’s to expand the pool of\nIntegrity Legal Support Solutions\nwww.integrity-texas.com\n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 85   Filed 06/15/20   Page 87 of 100\nDCCC - 4/28/2020\n86\n1 individuals, to have important conversations with people\n2 about the importance of voting, and conversations about\n3 important causes to the Democratic Party.  I’m trying to\n4 understand how all of those purposes are accomplished.\n5 So how do the voter registration activities address all\n6 of those purposes?  What do you do to achieve those\n7 purposes in the context of your voter registration\n8 efforts?\n9      A.   I think that this is all part of one\n10 conversation that naturally flows together where, you\n11 know, it might look something like, \"Hey, are you\n12 registered to vote?  Would you like to register to vote?\n13 And do you know there’s an election coming in November?\n14 If you register to vote now, you can participate in that\n15 or if there’s a primary coming up, you can participate\n16 in that\" and why it might be important to a voter to\n17 participate in that election and register at this time.\n18 I really think of it as all one conversation, not\n19 necessarily three different or a few different goals.\n20      Q.   Okay.  So this is -- all of these things are\n21 part of every conversation with someone who you’re\n22 trying to engage with; is that what you’re saying?\n23      A.   Yes.\n24      Q.   Okay.  That is helpful.  Thank you for\n25 clarifying that.\nIntegrity Legal Support Solutions\nwww.integrity-texas.com\n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 85   Filed 06/15/20   Page 88 of 100\nDCCC - 4/28/2020\n87\n1               Is there -- sorry.  I have a few\n2 follow-up questions on this, so I was trying to organize\n3 my thoughts.  How does DCCC track the success of these\n4 kinds of voter registration efforts?\n5               MS. BRANCH:  Object to the extent this\n6 calls for strategic information.\n7               But you may answer at a high level.\n8      A.   We certainly want to know how many voters\n9 we’ve registered.\n10      Q    (BY MR. HILTON)  So number of voters who get\n11 registered, how is that tracked?\n12      A.   I am not familiar with the specifics, but\n13 usually the people who are tasked with registering\n14 voters report back the top-line numbers.\n15      Q.   The top-line number being the total number of\n16 people who are registered?\n17      A.   Yes.\n18      Q.   Is that tracked for the whole cycle or by\n19 activity or by location?  What are some of the ways in\n20 which that’s broken down?\n21      A.   Yeah --\n22               MS. BRANCH:  Again, I’m going to assert\n23 the same objection on First Amendment grounds.\n24               You can answer at a high level.\n25      A.   I think it depends based on who’s in charge of\nIntegrity Legal Support Solutions\nwww.integrity-texas.com\n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 85   Filed 06/15/20   Page 89 of 100\nDCCC - 4/28/2020\n88\n1 the program, but it could be any of those things.  It\n2 could be just number of people or by the specific\n3 activity, like, \"This is how many people got registered\n4 today at this event\" or in a place.\n5      Q    (BY MR. HILTON)  Are there any other ways in\n6 which it’s tracked?\n7      A.   Not that I can think of.\n8      Q.   Can DCCC apportion a cost to register each new\n9 voter?\n10      A.   I guess it’s possible.\n11      Q.   Is that something that DCCC has already done?\n12      A.   No.\n13      Q.   That’s not data that DCCC has?\n14      A.   Correct.\n15      Q.   And when you said it was possible, what did\n16 you mean by that?\n17      A.   I mean, I think you could come up with some\n18 metric of how much money we are spending as it relates\n19 to how many people we are able to register to vote.\n20      Q.   But DCCC does not have any such metric\n21 currently?\n22               MS. BRANCH:  Objection, asked and\n23 answered.\n24      A.   No, not to my knowledge.\n25      Q    (BY MR. HILTON)  Has DCCC had a metric like\nIntegrity Legal Support Solutions\nwww.integrity-texas.com\n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 85   Filed 06/15/20   Page 90 of 100\nDCCC - 4/28/2020\n89\n1 that at any time from the beginning of 2014 to the\n2 present?\n3      A.   Not to my knowledge.\n4      Q.   How does the DCCC decide which voters to\n5 target?\n6               MS. BRANCH:  Objection, First Amendment\n7 privilege.\n8               You can answer at a high level to the\n9 extent you can.  We can’t disclose targeting and\n10 strategic information.\n11      A.   There are ways that we’re able to identify\n12 voters who are likely to support Democratic candidates\n13 or vote for Democrats.\n14      Q.   (BY MR. HILTON)  So that’s the target group,\n15 is folks you expect to vote Democratic?\n16      A.   Yes.\n17      Q.   How does DCCC decide which types of voter\n18 registration efforts to pursue?\n19               MS. BRANCH:  Again, same objection.\n20               You can answer at a high level.\n21               And that’s to First Amendment, to\n22 clarify.\n23      A.   I think it’s probably a variety of factors\n24 based on where our targeted races are as far as priority\n25 districts for the DCCC and where we are able to make an\nIntegrity Legal Support Solutions\nwww.integrity-texas.com\n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 85   Filed 06/15/20   Page 91 of 100\nDCCC - 4/28/2020\n90\n1 effort and a successful activity out of registering\n2 voters.\n3      Q.   (BY MR. HILTON)  Does DCCC adjust its\n4 activities based on a success rate?\n5      A.   Yeah.  I want to be clear that I don’t know if\n6 there’s necessarily, like, a success rate or a\n7 definition; but, you know, we certainly aren’t going to\n8 engage in efforts where -- in voter registration efforts\n9 where it’s not possible because of, like, geographic or\n10 logistics.\n11      Q.   Who makes those kinds of decisions?\n12               MS. BRANCH:  Objection, First Amendment\n13 privilege.  I’m going to instruct the witness not to\n14 answer that.\n15               MR. HILTON:  And so to be clear, my\n16 question is:  Who at the DCCC decides whether to adjust\n17 voter registration activities and how they do that.  And\n18 you’re instructing the witness not to answer?\n19               MS. BRANCH:  I mean, I think that you\n20 have that information.  If you want to pursue a high-\n21 level line of questioning, I’m okay with that; but my --\n22 what I think we’re doing is going into the strategy of\n23 how the D-Trip targets voters for voter registration.\n24 And that is protected by the First Amendment.\n25               So, Jacqui, if you want to answer that\nIntegrity Legal Support Solutions\nwww.integrity-texas.com\n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 85   Filed 06/15/20   Page 92 of 100\nDCCC - 4/28/2020\n91\n1 question, that’s fine.\n2               And maybe we can have the court reporter\n3 read that back; but beyond that, I’m going to object.\n4               MR. HILTON:  I’ll restate my question.\n5      Q.   (BY MR. HILTON) Who at DCCC adjusts which\n6 voter registration efforts that the group is going to\n7 engage in?\n8      A.   I think that a lot of that responsibility\n9 falls on the National Field Director.\n10      Q.   And how are those decisions made?\n11               MS. BRANCH:  Objection.  I’m going to\n12 instruct the witness not to answer.\n13               Is now maybe a good time to break for\n14 lunch?  I don’t mean to interrupt.\n15               MR. HILTON:  Well, I think now is a good\n16 time to take a break.  I need, like, ten minutes; but if\n17 y’all want to take longer, that’s fine, whatever y’all\n18 want to do.\n19               MS. BRANCH:  Can we do -- well, can I ask\n20 you how long you may have after lunch, if you have a\n21 rough estimate?\n22               MR. HILTON:  I don’t know.  I need the\n23 ten minutes to figure out what I’m going to do next.\n24               MS. BRANCH:  Okay.  Well, I think we\n25 need -- Jacqui, is 30, 45 minutes good for a you?\nIntegrity Legal Support Solutions\nwww.integrity-texas.com\n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 85   Filed 06/15/20   Page 93 of 100\nDCCC - 4/28/2020\n92\n1               THE WITNESS:  Yeah, 30 minutes should be\n2 fine for me.\n3               MS.

We can go off\n5 the record.\n6               THE REPORTER:  Going off the record at\n7 12:29 p.m.\n8               (Off the record from 12:30 to 1:05 p.m.)\n9               THE REPORTER:  We’re back on the record\n10 at 1:05 p.m.\n11      Q    (BY MR. HILTON)  All right.  Ms. Newman,\n12 before we broke we were talking about voter registration\n13 activities and expenditures.  And we, I think, had\n14 covered most of what I wanted to cover; but I just have\n15 a few -- couple of things to make sure I’m tying up all\n16 that that I want to discuss with you today.\n17               So for the 2018 cycle, which is the cycle\n18 where DCCC has some more insight into specific\n19 expenditures on voter registration, I just want to make\n20 sure that I have everything that you’ve told me so far\n21 correct.  You’ve given money to -- DCCC has given money\n22 to the Texas Democratic Party that’s earmarked for voter\n23 registration.  DCCC has hired a vendor to help with\n24 voter registration efforts, which we discussed earlier\n25 in connection with the Declaration, which I think is\nIntegrity Legal Support Solutions\nwww.integrity-texas.com\n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 85   Filed 06/15/20   Page 94 of 100\nDCCC - 4/28/2020\n93\n1 Exhibit 3.  Is there -- has anything else been spent\n2 that’s been earmarked for voter registration efforts for\n3 the 2018 election?\n4      A.   Sorry.  To be clear, I think -- I think the\n5 money we are talking about right now is for the current\n6 cycle, the 2020 cycle.\n7      Q.   Sorry.  Yes, I misspoke.  For the current\n8 cycle, the 2020 cycle.  So the TDP money that is\n9 earmarked and then the vendor for the 2020 cycle.  Is\n10 there anything else at this time?\n11      A.   Specifically on voter registration at this\n12 time, I don’t believe there is more money I can\n13 identify.  I mean, I think I mentioned earlier we’ve\n14 spent up to -- or a little bit over 1.1 million in Texas\n15 alone; and that includes our offices and our staff on\n16 the ground.  And, of course, you know, our staff is\n17 engaging in this, you know, community engagement; and\n18 they are out talking to voters and possibly registering\n19 voters as part of their daily activities.  And that is,\n20 you know, like, wrapped up in their salary.  It’s not\n21 necessarily identified in the other money I identified\n22 for voter registration.\n23               And I -- you know, I would say that we\n24 are still several months out from the election; and we\n25 will continue to make spending decisions as things\nIntegrity Legal Support Solutions\nwww.integrity-texas.com\n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 85   Filed 06/15/20   Page 95 of 100\nDCCC - 4/28/2020\n94\n1 develop and get closer and that some of the difficulties\n2 we face just around, you know, confusion that Texas\n3 voters might have around changing their address or\n4 renewing their information online and not being able to\n5 simultaneously register to vote will inevitably lead us\n6 to have to spend more money on voter registration and\n7 more time making sure we are educating voters, that they\n8 know that they might not have been registered to vote or\n9 had their address updated if they changed any\n10 information online through the DPS website.\n11      Q.   (Inaudible.)\n12               THE REPORTER:  I’m sorry.  Something’s\n13 happened to your audio.\n14               MR. HILTON:  (Inaudible.)  Better?\n15               THE REPORTER:  Not really.\n16               THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  Something has gone\n17 wrong with your audio.\n18               MR. HILTON:  (Inaudible.)\n19               THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  It’s a bandwidth\n20 issue.  Yeah, it sounds like you’re having bandwidth\n21 issues.

Nothing\n23 has changed on my end (echoing audio.)\n24               THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  We had the same\n25 problem the other day with Mr. Geise.

Should I drop off\n6 and reconnect (echoing audio)?\n7               THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  Let’s try that, yeah,\n8 just kind of an if you restarted your computer type of\n9 situation.  Just log out and then log back in and see if\n10 that doesn’t correct the issue.\n11               THE REPORTER:  I’m going to take us off\n12 the record at 1:10 p.m.\n13               (Off the record from 1:10 to 1:12 p.m.)\n14               THE REPORTER:  We are back on the record\n15 at 1:12 p.m.\n16      Q    (BY MR. HILTON)  Ms. Newman, how much more\n17 time and money will you have to spend?\n18      A.   I think it’s hard to say at this point as,\n19 again, we’re several months out from the election.  I\n20 also think, you know, the current COVID-19 crisis we’re\n21 in may have an outside impact on this because fewer\n22 people will be able to go into DPS in person and change\n23 their information and update their voter registration.\n24               So I think it’s too far out to put a\n25 number on it; but given that we’ve already invested, you\nIntegrity Legal Support Solutions\nwww.integrity-texas.com\n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 85   Filed 06/15/20   Page 97 of 100\nDCCC - 4/28/2020\n96\n1 know, over a half a million dollars to date, you know, I\n2 do not think that it is a small -- small investment.\n3      Q.   How much more do you plan to spend on voter\n4 registration efforts in Texas?\n5               MS. BRANCH:  Objection to the extent that\n6 this calls for strategic information.\n7               If you know, you can answer.\n8      A.   I -- you know, again, I don’t know if that has\n9 been decided yet.  I think it will depend as things\n10 shape up with the current environment; and as we get\n11 closer to the election, those expenditures are usually\n12 decided.\n13      Q.   (BY MR. HILTON)  How much money did DCCC spend\n14 on voter registration efforts in Texas for this election\n15 cycle prior to January 21st, 2020?\n16      A.   At least 40, $45,000.  $45,630.\n17      Q.   That was the transfer to TDP that we looked at\n18 earlier on one of the exhibits?\n19      A.   Yes.  And, you know, I would ad that we’ve had\n20 our staff on the ground in Texas in 2019.  So they were\n21 beginning to engage in these activities.\n22      Q.   And I appreciate you mentioning that when I\n23 was trying to get my arms around all the voter\n24 registration activities for the staff.  And we talked\n25 about earlier you couldn’t really break down what\nIntegrity Legal Support Solutions\nwww.integrity-texas.com\n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 85   Filed 06/15/20   Page 98 of 100\nDCCC - 4/28/2020\n97\n1 percentage of their duties were related to voter\n2 registration.  Am I remembering that correctly?\n3      A.   Yes, that’s correct.\n4      Q.   Okay.  Are there any other activities for\n5 this -- or expenditures of funds for the 2020 election\n6 cycle that we haven’t touched on yet?\n7               MS. BRANCH:  Objection, vague.  Is that\n8 related to voter registration or just expenditures\n9 generally?\n10               MR. HILTON:  I’m sorry.  I thought I said\n11 voter registration.\n12      A.   No, I think we’ve basically covered it.\n13      Q.   (BY MR. HILTON)  How much of that money has\n14 gone to try to register voters who change their address\n15 or renew their driver’s license online with DPS?\n16      A.   I don’t know if there’s a specific dollar\n17 amount associated with that.  I think that’s just part\n18 of our ongoing voter education effort to make sure when\n19 we’re talking to voters, \"Are you registered to vote?\"\n20 Making sure they are aware that if they’ve moved\n21 recently, depending on how they conducted that\n22 transaction online, that if it was online versus in\n23 person, that their information is treated differently\n24 than going in person to change that and that they might\n25 not, in fact, be registered to vote at their current\nIntegrity Legal Support Solutions\nwww.integrity-texas.com\n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 85   Filed 06/15/20   Page 99 of 100\nDCCC - 4/28/2020\n98\n1 address.\n2      Q.   Does DCCC keep track of the number of people\n3 who it talks to who change their address or renew their\n4 driver’s license online with DPS?\n5               MS. BRANCH:  Objection to the extent that\n6 this calls for strategic information.\n7               But you may answer.\n8      A.   Not that I’m aware of.\n9      Q    (BY MR. HILTON)  Do you have any -- does DCCC\n10 have any training materials that reflect those kinds of\n11 conversations that you were just referring to?\n12               MS. BRANCH:  Objection, vague, First\n13 Amendment privilege.\n14      A.   Not that I’m aware of.  I think, you know, the\n15 information required is part of the reason why we engage\n16 a consultant on the ground to run some of this.  You\n17 know, it’s difficult to register voters in Texas; and it\n18 requires a high level of expertise.  I think a lot of\n19 these activities also go through the Texas Democratic\n20 Party for these reasons.\n21      Q.   (BY MR. HILTON)  Okay.  So leaving aside what\n22 the Texas Democratic Party might have, DCCC doesn’t have\n23 any training materials reflecting how to have these\n24 conversations beyond what a vendor might have?\n25               MS. BRANCH:  Objection.  I think that’s\nIntegrity Legal Support Solutions\nwww.integrity-texas.com\n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 85   Filed 06/15/20   Page 100 of 100\nDCCC - 4/28/2020\n99\n1 been asked and answered.  I also think that it calls for\n2 internal materials in the content of what’s reflected in\n3 those.  So I’m going to instruct the witness not to\n4 answer that question.\n5      Q.   (BY MR. HILTON)  So my question is:  Does DCCC\n6 have any materials that reflect training with respect to\n7 how to have these kinds of conversations for voter\n8 registration efforts?\n9      A.   I don’t believe we have any public materials.\n10      Q.   Do you have any non-public materials?\n11               MS. BRANCH:  Again, I maintain the\n12 objection and instruct the witness not to answer.\n13               MR. HILTON:  Okay.  So you won’t allow\n14 the witness to answer as to the existence of such\n15 materials?\n16               MS. BRANCH:  She’s already answered the\n17 question.\n18      Q.   (BY MR. HILTON)  Do such materials exist,\n19 Ms. Newman?\n20      A.   I’m not going to answer.\n21      Q.   And is that at counsel’s instruction?\n22      A.   Yes.\n23      Q.   Okay.  And no such materials were produced to\n24 us?\n25      A.   Correct.\nIntegrity Legal Support Solutions\nwww.integrity-texas.com",

DPS seamlessly integrates voter registration into its mail-in change-of-address and in-\nperson driver’s license applications. ............................................................................................. 12 \nII.  Defendants do not provide simultaneous voter registration applications with online \ntransactions, but instead require additional steps and duplicative information before an applicant \ncan register or update their voter registration information. .......................................................... 14 \nIII.  Plaintiffs moved, transacted with DPS online to update their driver’s license information, \nand yet Defendants failed to update their voter registration information. .................................... 18 \nA.

Defendants’ Conduct Injures Each Organizational Plaintiff .......................................... 20 \ni.  MOVE Texas Civic Fund ............................................................................................... 21 \nii.  League of Women Voters of Texas ............................................................................ 22 \nIV.  DPS is technologically capable of collecting and transmitting voter-registration \ninformation from online transactions to SOS and doing so would not be cost prohibitive. ......... 24 \nARGUMENT ................................................................................................................................ 25 \nI.  Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits of their claims that Defendants are violating the \nNVRA and the U.S. Constitution by failing to provide simultaneous voter registration \napplications during online driver’s license change-of-address and renewal transactions ............ 25 \nA.  Texas’s failure to treat online DPS transactions as simultaneous voter registration \napplications violates the NVRA ................................................................................................ 26 \ni.  The plain language of the NVRA controls ..................................................................... 26 \nii.  Defendants fail to treat online driver’s license renewal applications as “simultaneous” \nvoter registration applications in violation of 52 U.S.C. §§ 20503(a)(1), 20504(a)(1), and \n20504(a)(2). .......................................................................................................................... 27 \niii.  Defendants fail to treat online driver’s license change-of-address applications as \nnotifications for voter registration in violation of 52 U.S.C. § 20504(d). ............................ 28 \n2 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 5   Filed 01/17/20   Page 3 of 48\n \n \niv.  Defendants’ requirement that applicants submit a separate voter registration \napplication upon completion of online driver’s license transactions violates the NVRA’s \nprohibition against requiring duplicative information, 52 U.S.C. § 20504(c)(2). ................ 28 \nv.  Defendants’ failure to transmit voter registration information submitted during online \ndriver’s license transactions violates 52 U.S.C. § 20504(e). ................................................ 29 \nvi.  SOS’s failure to ensure that eligible applicants are registered to vote upon completion \nof the voter registration portion of online driver’s license change-of-address and renewal \napplications violates 52 U.S.C. § 20507(a)(1)(A). ............................................................... 29 \nB.  Texas’s failure to treat online DPS transactions as voter registration applications \nviolates the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution .................................. 30 \ni.  The First and Fourteenth Amendments protect against restrictions that place \nunreasonable burdens on the right to vote. ........................................................................... 30 \nii.  Defendants’ refusal to treat online driver’s license transactions as voter registration \napplications unduly burdens Plaintiffs’ right to vote. ........................................................... 31 \niii.  Defendants’ previously asserted interest in requiring handwritten signatures is \ninsufficient to justify the burdens created by their treatment of online DPS transactions. ... 32 \niv.  DPS’s handwritten signature requirement as to online transactions is unreasonable. 33 \nII.  Plaintiffs will suffer irreparable injury absent a preliminary injunction and have no adequate \nremedy at law. ............................................................................................................................... 34 \nA.  Defendants’ failure to simultaneously register Individual Plaintiffs constitutes an \nirreparable injury and must be remedied by February 3, 2020 in order to be effective for the \nMarch 3, 2020 Presidential Primary Election. .......................................................................... 35 \nB.  Defendants’ legal violations cause irreparable harm to Organizational Plaintiffs by \ncausing them to divert resources, undermining their core missions, and impeding their \nindividual members’ voting rights. ........................................................................................... 36 \ni.  Organizational Plaintiffs are irreparably harmed by being forced to divert their limited \nresources to register voters who were denied the opportunity to register when transacting \nwith DPS online. ................................................................................................................... 37 \nii.  Defendants’ legal violations cause confusion and disenfranchisement at the polls, \nthus irreparably harming Organizational Plaintiffs by undermining their voter engagement \nefforts. ................................................................................................................................... 39 \niii.  Plaintiff LWVTX has individual members who are irreparably injured by \nDefendants’ violations by being unable to register to vote or update their registrations when \ntransacting with DPS online. ................................................................................................. 41 \nIII.

Instead of \ncomplying with the NVRA’s mandates by providing voter registration applications to almost 1.5 \nmillion Texans every year, the State continues to thumb its nose at the law and its own voters. \nNow, within 120 days of the March 3, 2020 Presidential Primary Election, a federal election1, the \nState is still violating the voting rights of the Plaintiffs in this case and, unless this Court acts \nswiftly, will continue to violate those rights to the detriment of the Plaintiffs and the public at large.  \nIndividual Plaintiffs and affected members of Associational Plaintiff in this case must have \ntheir voter registrations acknowledged no later than February 3, 2020 in order to be effective to \nvote in the March 3, 2020 Primary Election. Each day that passes, thousands of Texans are \ndeprived of their right to register to vote, and Organizational Plaintiffs are deprived of time and \nresources they will never be able to recuperate trying to remedy the harm created by the State’s \nviolations. Therefore, Plaintiffs respectfully submit this Emergency Application for Preliminary \nInjunction, pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 65, to prevent Defendants from further violating the NVRA, \n52 U.S.C. §§ 20501-20511. \nNATURE AND STAGE OF THE PROCEEDINGS \nPlaintiffs filed their Complaint in this action on January 14, 2020 (Dkt. 1). Through this \nmotion, Plaintiffs now seek a preliminary injunction against Defendants. \n                                                 \n1 App’x  9  (Ex.  5,  Texas  Secretary  of  State,  Important  2020  Election  Dates.);  see  also, \nhttps://www.sos.state.tx.us/elections/voter/2020-important-election-dates.shtml (last visited Jan. \n16, 2020). \n6 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 5   Filed 01/17/20   Page 7 of 48\n \n \nSUMMARY OF ISSUES \n To obtain a preliminary injunction the movant must show: (1) a substantial likelihood of \nsuccess on the merits, (2) a substantial threat of irreparable injury if the injunction is not issued, \n(3) that the threatened injury if the injunction is denied outweighs any harm that will result if the \ninjunction is granted, and (4) that the grant of an injunction will not disserve the public interest.  \nByrum v. Landreth, 566 F.3d 442, 445 (5th Cir. 2009).  \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nPlaintiffs are entitled to a preliminary injunction. First, Plaintiffs are virtually certain to \nsucceed on the merits. Although overturned on standing grounds, this Court previously recognized \nthe merits of Plaintiffs’ argument, Stringer v. Pablos, 320 F. Supp. 3d 862 (W.D. Tex. 2018), rev’d \nand remanded sub nom. Error! Bookmark not defined., and even State officials have not seriously \ndisputed  that  the  NVRA’s  plain  text  requires  all  driver’s  license  transactions  to  serve  as \nsimultaneous  voter  registration  opportunities.  Individual  Plaintiffs  and  affected  members  of \nAssociational Plaintiff will suffer irreparable injury if they are not granted a preliminary injunction \nordering Defendants to register them to vote by February 3, 2020—the registration deadline for \nthe March 3, 2020 Primary Election. Individual Plaintiffs and affected members of Associational \nPlaintiff will also suffer an irreparable injury if Defendants do not treat their future online driver’s \nlicense transactions as voter registration applications. Organizational Plaintiffs will suffer an \nirreparable injury absent an injunction ordering Defendants to treat all online DPS transactions as \nvoter registration applications for eligible Texans who wish to simultaneously register to vote. \nThis injury accrues with each day that they must compensate for Defendants’ failure to register \nvoters in compliance with the NVRA, and with each voter who is eventually disenfranchised due \nto this failure. The time and resources these organizations expend can never be recouped nor are \n7 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 5   Filed 01/17/20   Page 8 of 48\n \n \nthey fully compensable by monetary damages. The serious and irreparable harm that Plaintiffs face \nabsent  injunctive  relief  greatly  outweighs  the  non-existent  harm  that  Defendants  face  by \ncomplying with federal law. Defendants have no viable interest in maintaining their current illegal \nscheme and have previously acknowledged the technological ease with which they can comply \nwith the NVRA’s Motor Voter provisions. Defendants already use electronic signatures for voter \nregistration purposes when it comes to in-person and mail-in driver’s license transactions, and \nnothing prevents them from doing so for online driver’s license transactions. Finally, as Congress \nrecognized by passing the NVRA in the first place, the public interest is served by greater civic \nparticipation.  \nBACKGROUND2 \nCase Background \nIn 2015, the State of Texas was put on notice that it was violating the voting rights of \nhundreds of thousands of Texans by willfully ignoring its obligations under the NVRA, a decades-\nold federal law. After the State still refused to comply, several Texas voters, including Jarrod \nStringer, a Plaintiff in the instant action, filed suit (“Stringer I”). After years of litigation and untold \namounts of wasted taxpayer dollars, the State remains steadfast in its refusal to correct these \nfailures—despite having the funds and technologic ability to do so. To this day, the NVRA rights \nof nearly 1.5 million Texans are violated yearly, each time one of those individuals interacts online \nwith the Department of Public Safety (“DPS”) driver’s license system to renew or update their \nlicense. See Dkt. 1, Ex. A (2016 DPS transaction totals). \nUnder the NVRA, each time an eligible resident obtains, renews, or updates his or her \ndriver’s  license  with  DPS,  the  State  must  ensure  that  the  driver’s  license  application \n                                                 \n2 Plaintiffs filed this lawsuit on January 14, 2020, and incorporate herein all allegations contained \nwithin their Original Complaint (Dkt. 1). \n8 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 5   Filed 01/17/20   Page 9 of 48\n \n \nsimultaneously serves as a voter registration application. 52 U.S.C. § 20503(a)(1).  In 2018, Chief \nJudge Orlando Garcia ruled on cross motions for summary judgment in Stringer I, finding, inter \nalia,  \nThe  NVRA’s  requirement  that  DPS,  a  voter  registration  agency,  provide  a \nsimultaneous application for both driver’s license and voter registration purposes is \nplain and unambiguous and the facts in the record confirm that Texans are being \ndeprived of this statutory right. \n \nStringer v. Pablos, 320 F. Supp. 3d 862, 891 (W.D. Tex. 2018), rev’d and remanded sub nom. \n  \nIn accordance with this finding, the Court entered judgment enjoining the State’s ongoing \nNVRA violations. The State appealed and, in November of 2019, the Fifth Circuit Court of \nAppeals  reversed  this  Court’s  decision,  finding  that  the  plaintiffs  failed  to  satisfy  standing \nrequirements. Notably, the Fifth Circuit did not disturb the merits of the lower court’s decision. \nIndeed, without deciding the merits, Judge James Ho observed that, “[o]n the plain text of the \nstatute, the rule seems simple enough: If it’s good enough for motorist licensing, then it ought to \nbe good enough for voter registration.” Judge Ho went on, lamenting: \n. . . Plaintiffs have indeed endured an injury . . . they were unable to exercise their \nright to vote in past election cycles. And it is a right they will never be able to \nrecover. As citizens, we can hope it is a deprivation they will not experience again \n. . . \n \nStringer v. Whitley, 942 F.3d 715, 726 (5th Cir. 2019) (Ho, J., concurring). \n \nAnd yet, Mr. Stringer and countless other Texas voters have again been injured by \nDefendants’ legal violations. The State continues to flout its obligations under 52 U.S.C. § 20504, \nmeaning that millions of Texans are still denied their right to register to vote when they use DPS’s \nonline system. As a result, eligible Texas voters either did not appear on the voter rolls or appeared \nwith incorrect address information when they attempted to exercise their franchise in 2018—and \nwere disenfranchised as a result. Countless more stand to be similarly impacted during the Primary \n9 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 5   Filed 01/17/20   Page 10 of 48\n \n \nand General Elections in 2020. Even more Texans will simply not show up to vote in the first place \nafter realizing they remain unregistered because they were never provided their legal right to \nregister to vote when transacting with DPS online.  \nFactual Background \nThe central fact of this case has never been disputed: When eligible Texans update their \ndriver’s licenses online with DPS they are not offered a simultaneous application to register to vote \nor update their voter registration information.3 As this Court has already held, the NVRA requires \nthat each driver’s license application, including any renewal application, simultaneously serve as \nan application for voter registration, and that each change-of-address form be used to update the \nvoter’s registration records. See Stringer v. Pablos, 320 F. Supp. 3d 862, 891 (W.D. Tex. 2018), \nrev’d and remanded sub nom.  \nTexas’s refusal to integrate voter registration into its online driver’s license renewal and \nchange-of-address process affects nearly 1.5 million Texans annually, Dkt. 1 Ex. A, including the \nPlaintiffs in this case. Each Individual Plaintiff is an eligible Texas voter who transacted with \nDPS’s online system to change their driver’s license address and was denied the right to register \nor update their voter registration. Each Individual Plaintiff remains unregistered as of now and is \ndirectly and individually harmed by Defendants’ conduct. As a result of Defendants’ failure to \ncomply with the NVRA, each Individual Plaintiff is being denied their federal right to register to \nvote through an online transaction with DPS. They are also denied an equal opportunity to \nparticipate  in  a  federal  election—for  no  reason  other  than  the  method  through  which  they \n                                                 \n3 As Defendants put it in Stringer I, “[t]he key facts of this case are not disputed.” Defs.’ Reply in \nSupp. of Mot. to Dismiss at 6, Stringer I, No. 5:16-cv-00257-OLG (Jun. 06, 2016); see also Joint \nReport on Alternative Dispute Resolution at 2, Stringer I, No. 5:16-cv-00257-OLG (Sep. 9, 2016) \n(stating that the parties agree “that their primary dispute is legal, rather than factual”). \n10 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 5   Filed 01/17/20   Page 11 of 48\n \n \ntransacted with DPS. Impacted members of the Plaintiff League of Women Voters of Texas \n(“LWVTX”) have been, are, and/or will be denied these same rights. \n  Each Organizational Plaintiff is forced to expend resources to counteract Defendants’ \nfailure to comply with the NVRA in a myriad of ways and is further harmed by the frustration of \ntheir mission that occurs because of Defendants’ failure to comply.  \nTexas has known for years that its online driver’s license practices disenfranchise large \nnumbers of voters. Between September 2013 and February 2015, for instance, more than 1,800 \nTexans complained about Texas’s failure to register individuals to vote through the DPS online \ndriver's license application, according to the State’s own records. Dkt. 1 Ex. D. Yet Texas took no \nmeaningful steps to fix its process. Instead, adding insult to injury, DPS encourages the use of the \nonline system over in-person transactions, resulting—predictably—in a dramatic uptick in online \ntransactions and, by extension, injured prospective voters. Organizational Plaintiffs, through their \nGet-Out-The-Vote (“GOTV”) efforts, encounter disenfranchised voters who attempt to vote \nmistakenly believing they had registered to vote when submitting their online driver’s license \napplication. \n  DPS  operates  offices  around  the  state  and  issues  driver’s  licenses  and  other  state \nidentification cards. DPS’s in-person application forms and mail-in change-of-address forms \ncurrently serve as simultaneous voter registration applications as required under the NVRA.4 \nDPS’s online renewal and change-of-address form does not, however, serve as a simultaneous \nvoter registration application.5  \n                                                 \n4 App’x 48-50 (Ex. 12, Texas Department of Public Safety Implementation Plan, D_00021063 at \nD_00021065); Stringer I, 320 F.

App’x 178 (Ex. 24, Declaration of Jarrod Stringer (“Stringer Dep.”) at ¶ \n2). Mr. Stringer initially filed a lawsuit against the State in 2016. After moving from Arlington to \nSan Antonio, Mr. Stringer updated the address on his driver’s license online using the DPS website \non August 1, 2014. Id. at ¶ 3. The State failed to simultaneously update his voter registration, as \nrequired by the NVRA, during Mr. Stringer’s transaction. Id. Due to the confusing setup of the \nonline driver’s license portal, Mr. Stringer, like countless other Texans, mistakenly believed that \nhe had updated his voter registration. Id. As a result of Defendants’ failure to simultaneously \nregister him to vote, Mr. Stringer was unable to cast a full ballot in the 2014 General Election. Id.  \nMr.  Stringer  is  now,  again,  being  harmed  by  Defendants’  violations.  On  or  around \nNovember  23,  2019,  the  State  again  refused  to  provide  a  simultaneous  voter  registration \napplication when, after moving from San Antonio to Houston, his driver’s license address was \nupdated online using the DPS website.

Moreover, with just weeks remaining until the voter registration \ndeadline for the March primary elections, none are currently registered to vote at their current \naddress. Defendants have repeatedly maintained that they are unwilling to change the policies and \npractices that caused the injuries described herein.29 Since Defendants refuse to correct the \nviolations at issue in this lawsuit for future transactions, Individual Plaintiffs also face the \nadditional harm of being denied their NVRA-protected right to simultaneously submit a voter \nregistration application when each Individual Plaintiff changes the address on or renews their \ndriver’s license online in the future. \nB.  Defendants’ Conduct Injures Each Organizational Plaintiff \n \nEach Organizational Plaintiff is harmed by the State’s failure to comply with the NVRA \nand the Constitution in at least three distinct ways: first, Organizational Plaintiffs must expend \nadditional resources to register people to vote who would have otherwise been able to register to \nvote or to update their voter registrations through the DPS’s online driver’s license system. Second, \nOrganizational Plaintiffs must expend additional resources to educate DPS applicants who update \nthe address on and/or renew their driver’s license through the DPS website and mistakenly believe \ntheir online DPS transaction also registered them to vote that they are not in fact registered to vote. \nThird, Organizational Plaintiffs’ GOTV efforts are thwarted when a voter whom they convinced \nto show up to the polls is denied the chance to cast a ballot that counts because they were not \n                                                 \n29 Stringer I, 320 F.

DPS is technologically capable of collecting and transmitting voter-registration \ninformation from online transactions to SOS and doing so would not be cost \nprohibitive. \n \nThe change Plaintiffs call for—requiring DPS to record and transfer the registration \ninformation it already collects and confirms during online driver’s license renewal or change-of-\naddress to the SOS, along with the applicant’s previously-obtained electronic signature, and \nrequiring SOS to transfer the voter registration information to local voter registrars—is possible \nand would not be overly burdensome.30 As Director of Elections Keith Ingram, SOS’s 30(b)(6) \ndesignee in the previous litigation, testified, “This is a very possible thing to do. . . .”31 In his \ntestimony, Mr. Ingram went on to express a doubt about the legality under state law of doing so; \nhowever, as described below, see infra 29-32, and as this Court previously observed, Stringer I, \n320 F. Supp. 3d at 895-97, the State’s supposed concerns are unavailing, as state procedures are \nsuperseded to the extent they conflict with the NVRA. In fact, DPS and SOS already do for in-\nperson and mail-in change-of-address transactions exactly that which Plaintiffs request this Court \nto order for online transactions. Moreover, implementing Plaintiffs’ request would be even easier \nthan the current process for in-person and mail-in change-of-address transactions because DPS \napplicants  would  be  entering  their  data  into  the  system  instead  of  DPS  applicant  service \nrepresentatives. \nNor have Defendants claimed that the cost of Plaintiffs’ requested remedy would be \nprohibitive. Mr. Ingram opined that it would not cost a lot of money for DPS to send the previously \n                                                 \n30 App’x 104 (Ex. 16, Gipson 30(b)(6) Dep. at 175:24-176:8; Stringer I, No. 16-CA-257-OG, Dkt. \n77-1 at 68); App’x 126 (Ex. 18, Crawford Dep. 143:25-144:21; Stringer I, No. 16-CA-257-OG, \nDkt. 77-1 at 90). \n31 App’x 66 (Ex. 14, Ingram 30(b)(6) Dep. 186:5-13; Stringer I, No. 16-CA-257-OG, Dkt. 77-1 at \n46).  \n24 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 5   Filed 01/17/20   Page 25 of 48\n \n \nobtained electronic signature to SOS, and further estimated that the cost of a fully online voter \nregistration program, which goes beyond what Plaintiffs seek, would be $182,000.32  \nARGUMENT \nIndividual Plaintiffs, Organizational Plaintiffs, and Associational Plaintiff are all entitled to a \npreliminary injunction. \n \nI.  Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits of their claims that Defendants are \nviolating the NVRA and the U.S. Constitution by failing to provide simultaneous \nvoter registration applications during online driver’s license change-of-address and \nrenewal transactions \n \nThe right to vote is fundamental, and Texas’s violations of that right injures, have injured, \nand will continue to injure Plaintiffs.

Texas, 867 F.3d at 604, 612 (5th Cir. 2017). \nThe  facts  establish  that  Defendants  unequivocally  violate  the  NVRA  and  the  U.S. \nConstitution by failing to treat online driver’s license renewals or change-of-address applications \nas simultaneous applications to register to vote or update voter registration, in glaring contrast to \n                                                 \n32 Id.184:12-185:5, 186:21-187:24. \n25 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 5   Filed 01/17/20   Page 26 of 48\n \n \nthe way that in-person and mail transactions are treated. Individual Plaintiffs and impacted \nmembers of Associational Plaintiff LWVTX are Texans eligible to register to vote who changed \nthe address on and/or renewed their driver’s license online, but whose transaction Defendants \nrefused to treat as a simultaneous voter registration application. Organizational Plaintiffs LWVTX \nand MOVE Texas instruct, educate, and register to vote eligible Texans who have been injured by \nDefendants’ legal violations. For these reasons, Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits of \ntheir claims. \nA.  Texas’s failure to treat online DPS transactions as simultaneous voter registration \napplications violates the NVRA \n \ni.  The plain language of the NVRA controls \n \n“Statutory construction, of course, begins with the plain language of statute.” In re Dale, \n582 F.3d 568, 573 (5th Cir. 2009). Where the plain language of the statute is clear, federal courts \nare compelled to apply the statute’s mandate. Multiple courts—including this one—have struck \ndown state policies in violation of the plain language mandates of the NVRA. Stringer v. Pablos, \n320 F. Supp. 3d 862 (W.D. Tex. 2018) rev’d on other grounds sub nom.; Action NC v. Strach, 216 \nF.

State Conference of N.A.A.C.P., 841 F. Supp. 2d at 1329, 1330, \n1335 (finding, in part, that plain language interpretation of Section 7 of the NVRA requires an \n26 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 5   Filed 01/17/20   Page 27 of 48\n \n \nassistance office supplying an application for assistance to distribute voter registration and voter \npreference forms regardless of whether the application was made in person).  \nii.  Defendants  fail  to  treat  online  driver’s  license  renewal  applications  as \n“simultaneous” voter registration applications in violation of 52 U.S.C. §§ \n20503(a)(1), 20504(a)(1), and 20504(a)(2). \n \nThe NVRA requires that “each” driver’s license application, including “any” renewal \napplication, serve as a simultaneous application for voter registration.  52 U.S.C. §§ 20503(a)(1), \n20504(a)(1), 20504(c)(1); Stringer v. Pablos, 320 F. Supp. 3d 862, 890 (W.D. Tex. 2018) rev’d \non other grounds sub nom. Moreover, the NVRA mandates that each voter registration application \nsubmitted to the state motor vehicle authority as part of a driver’s license application, including \nany  renewal  application,  update  any  previous  registration  by  the  applicant.  52  U.S.C.  § \n20504(a)(2); Stringer I, 320 F. Supp. 3d at 890.  \nAs set out above, Defendants cannot dispute that the NVRA applies to all driver’s license \napplication transactions, including online transactions. Stringer I, 320 F. Supp. 3d at 889; Action \nNC, 216 F. Supp. 3d at 622-23 (holding that “the words “each” and “any” in Section 5 require \nvoter registration services to be provided with all covered transactions[,]” including remote \napplication, renewal, and change-of-address transactions). Nor can they dispute that in Texas, \ndriver’s license renewal applications submitted to DPS online do not serve as simultaneous \napplications for voter registration, or that Defendants do not treat driver’s license change-of-\naddress  applications  submitted  to  DPS  online  as  updates  to  an  applicant’s  previous  voter \nregistration.  \nWhile a voter’s registration need not be “effected simultaneously with their NVRA-\ncovered driver’s license transaction,” the NVRA requires that the actual application for voter \nregistration be simultaneous with the NVRA-covered driver’s license application in “a single \n27 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 5   Filed 01/17/20   Page 28 of 48\n \n \ntransaction.” Stringer I, 274 F. Supp. 3d at 595. Accordingly, “[w]here, as here, Defendants have \nchosen to offer an online forum for NVRA-covered driver’s license transactions, the NVRA thus \nrequires them to accept voter registration applications through that forum simultaneously with the \nNVRA-covered driver’s license submissions that forum supports.” Id. at 601; see also Stringer I, \n320 F. Supp. 3d at 889. \niii.  Defendants fail to treat online driver’s license change-of-address applications \nas notifications for voter registration in violation of 52 U.S.C. § 20504(d). \n \nUnder the NVRA, all change-of-address forms submitted “in accordance with State law \nfor purposes of a State motor vehicle driver’s license” must also serve as a notifications of change-\nof-address for voter registration purposes “unless the registrant states on the form that the change-\nof-address is not for voter registration purposes.” 52 U.S.C. § 20504(d); Stringer I, 320 F. Supp. \n3d at 890. Driver’s license “change-of-address forms must have equal effect as voter registration \nchange-of-address forms[.]” Stringer I, 274 F. Supp. 3d at 597. An applicant who has changed his \ndriver’s license address online has done so in accordance with state law, which does not impose a \nsignature requirement on changes of address. It is undisputed that Defendants do not treat these \nonline submissions to DPS as notifications of change-of-address for voter registration purposes. \nAs this Court found, this “is inconsistent with the plain language of the NVRA.” Id.; see also \nStringer I, 320 F. Supp. 3d at 889. \niv.  Defendants’ requirement that applicants submit a separate voter registration \napplication upon completion of online driver’s license transactions violates the \nNVRA’s prohibition against requiring duplicative information, 52 U.S.C. § \n20504(c)(2).  \n \nThe NVRA states that the voter-registration section of driver’s license application forms \n“may not require any information that duplicates information required in the driver’s license \nportion of the form[.]” 52 U.S.C.§ 20504(c)(2); Stringer I, 320 F. Supp. 3d at 892.This Court held \n28 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 5   Filed 01/17/20   Page 29 of 48\n \n \nthat Defendants’ procedures violate the NVRA’s limits on duplicative information because the \nseparate voter registration form that DPS directs its applicants to complete after an online \ntransaction duplicates almost entirely the information required by DPS’ online change-of-address \nform and combined change-of-address and renewal form. See Stringer I, 320 F. Supp. 3d at 892-\n93. As this Court noted,  \n[r]equiring motor voters to go to a different agency (SOS) to obtain and fill out a \nseparate application that requires the same information violates the prohibition \nagainst duplicate information set forth in 52 U.S.C. § 20504(c).  \n \nId. at 893. To comply with the NVRA, then, Defendants must allow applicants who complete \nonline change-of-address and license renewal forms to apply to register to vote as part of the same \napplication. Id. at 892-93.  \nv.  Defendants’  failure  to  transmit  voter  registration  information  submitted \nduring online driver’s license transactions violates 52 U.S.C. § 20504(e).  \nThe NVRA mandates that states transmit completed voter-registration portions of driver’s \nlicense applications “to the appropriate State election official not later than 10 days after the date \nof acceptance[,]” or, if the application is completed within 5 days before the last day of a \nregistration period, “not later than 5 days after the date of acceptance.” 52 U.S.C. §§ 20504(e)(1)-\n(2). DPS does not even record—and therefore cannot transmit—applicants’ responses to the voter \nregistration question on the online driver’s license renewal and change-of-address application. \nFurther, despite collecting from each online applicant the personal information necessary for voter \nregistration, DPS does not transmit this information to SOS for those applicants who wish to \nregister or update their voter registration. Defendants’ failure to do so violates the clear mandate \nof the NVRA.  \nvi.  SOS’s failure to ensure that eligible applicants are registered to vote upon \ncompletion of the voter registration portion of online driver’s license change-\nof-address and renewal applications violates 52 U.S.C. § 20507(a)(1)(A).  \n \n29 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 5   Filed 01/17/20   Page 30 of 48\n \n \nBeing responsible for Texas’s compliance with the NVRA, SOS must ensure that eligible \napplicants are registered to vote in an election “if the valid voter registration form of the applicant \nis submitted to the appropriate State motor vehicle authority not later than the lesser of 30 days, or \nthe period provided by State law, before the date of the election.” 52 U.S.C. § 20507(a)(1)(A). As \nset out above and in this Court’s previous rulings, under the NVRA, online driver license renewal \nand change-of-address forms are valid voter registration applications. Thus, individuals who \nindicate that they want to register to vote during an online driver’s license transaction are required \nto be registered to vote. However, SOS does not ensure that eligible applicants who indicate they \nwish to register to vote or update their voter registration during an online driver’s license renewal \nor change-of-address transaction are registered to vote.  This constitutes a plain violation of the \nNVRA. \nB.  Texas’s failure to treat online DPS transactions as voter registration applications \nviolates the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution \ni.  The First and Fourteenth Amendments protect against restrictions that place \nunreasonable burdens on the right to vote. \nWhen assessing a challenge to a state restriction on the right to vote, courts use the standard \nlaid out in Anderson v. Celebrezze, 460 U.S. 780 (1983) and Burdick v. Takushi, 504 U.S. 428, \n434 (1992). Under the Anderson-Burdick standard, a court  \nmust weigh “the character and magnitude of the asserted injury to the rights \nprotected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments that the plaintiff seeks to \nvindicate” against “the precise interests put forward by the [s]tate as justifications \nfor the burden imposed by its rule,” taking into consideration “the extent to which \nthose interests make it necessary to burden the plaintiff's rights.”  \n \nBurdick, 504 U.S. at 434 (quoting Anderson, 460 U.S. at 789). \nIn Crawford v. Marion County Election Bd., the Supreme Court, applying the Anderson-\nBurdick standard, noted that  \n30 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 5   Filed 01/17/20   Page 31 of 48\n \n \nrather than applying any ‘litmus test’ that would neatly separate valid from invalid \nrestrictions, . . . a court must identify and evaluate the interests put forward by the \nState as justifications for the burden imposed by its rule, and then make the ‘hard \njudgment’ that our adversary system demands. \n \n553 U.S. 181, 190 (2008). The Supreme Court further explained that, however slight of a burden \na state restriction on an individual voter may appear, “it must be justified by relevant and legitimate \nstate interests ‘sufficiently weighty to justify the limitation.’” Crawford, 553 U.S. at 191 (citing \nNorman v. Reed, 502 U.S. 279, 288–89 (1992)). A sufficiently weighty justification is the \ndifference between a reasonable and an unreasonable restriction. Crawford at 190 (citing Burdick, \n504 U.S. at 434).  \nDefendants  cannot  provide  any  rational  reason—much  less  a  “sufficiently  weighty” \njustification—for the burden they impose on the right to vote in Texas. Therefore, Defendants’ \ntreatment of online DPS transactions violates the U.S. Constitution.    \nii.  Defendants’  refusal  to  treat  online  driver’s  license  transactions  as  voter \nregistration applications unduly burdens Plaintiffs’ right to vote.  \n \nTexas treats some driver’s license applications as applications to register to vote, and also \ndoes not treat other driver’s license applications as applications to register to vote. And there is no \ndispute that Texas refuses to provide a simultaneous voter registration application for people who \nare similarly situated to in-person or mail-in applicants in every way but one—they completed \ntheir transactions online.  \nInstead of using the information applicants already provide to DPS to register them to vote \nor update their voter registration information, Texas burdens applicants who transact with DPS \nonline with a requirement that they retrieve, complete, print, and mail an entirely separate voter \nregistration form in order to register or update their voter registration information. This burden is \nborne exclusively by online applicants; DPS applicants who apply for or change their license \n31 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 5   Filed 01/17/20   Page 32 of 48\n \n \ninformation in person, or change their address by mail, are not required to complete a separate, \nadditional voter registration application in order to register or update their voter registration \ninformation. This burden is a restriction on the fundamental right to vote that warrants “the \ndemonstration  of  a  corresponding  interest  sufficiently  weighty  to  justify  the  limitation.” \nDefendants have no such justification. Crawford, 553 U.S. at 191 (citing Norman v. Reed, 502 \nU.S. 279, 288–89 (1992)). \niii.  Defendants’ previously asserted interest in requiring handwritten signatures \nis insufficient to justify the burdens created by their treatment of online DPS \ntransactions.  \n \nIn Stringer I, Defendants’ justification for this burden was that DPS’s online applicants \ncannot sign the online driver’s license form by hand, and that handwritten signatures are necessary \nto later check against the signature on the poll book. 320 F. Supp. 3d at 899. The record in Stringer \nI,  however,  demonstrates  that  the  state  does  not  even  use  handwritten  signatures  for  voter \nregistration or voter verification purposes. Id. at 899 n.54. Instead, DPS collects and SOS and \ncounties use electronic signatures of voters. Id. 899-900. Indeed, even though a DPS applicant \nwho indicates he wishes to register to vote on a mail-in change-of-address form provides DPS with \na handwritten signature on that mail-in form, the signature DPS sends to SOS for voter registration \npurposes—and the signature SOS transmits to county election officials for voter registration—is \nthe previously-provided electronic signature collected during the applicantr’s most recent in-\nperson transaction. \nAlthough the state has an interest in verifying voter identity at the polls, this interest has \nnothing  to  do  with  the  handwritten  signatures  collected  by  DPS  during  driver’s  license \ntransactions, since the State only collects and uses electronic signatures on DPS applicants’ voter \nregistration  applications.  This  interest  is  therefore  irrelevant  to  and  insufficient  to  justify \n32 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 5   Filed 01/17/20   Page 33 of 48\n \n \nDefendants restriction on eligible Texans registering to vote during an online driver’s license \ntransaction.  \nIn Stringer I, Defendants also claimed that they treat everyone equally because the \nsignature requirement applies to everyone, and that everyone who fails to sign a change-of-address \nor renewal application is not registered to vote. Defendants fundamentally misunderstood the \nAnderson-Burdick application to state-imposed burdens on the right to vote. Crawford, 553 U.S. \nat 190, 191. The standard requires states to justify the burden they impose on the right to vote. \nBurdick, 504 U.S. at 434 (quoting Anderson, 460 U.S. at 789). Defendants’ handwritten signature \nargument is insufficient to justify the burden that the state applies to online DPS applicants. \niv.  DPS’s  handwritten  signature  requirement  as  to  online  transactions  is \nunreasonable. \n  As pointed out by the Court previously in Stringer I, Defendants have not explained, and \ncannot explain, how the handwritten signature requirement is necessary. 320 F. Supp. 3d at 899-\n900. As the Court observed, because DPS collects electronic signatures during every in-person \ndriver’s license transaction—including applicants’ first applications for a Texas driver’s license—\nDPS already has a signature on file for every person who subsequently renews or changes their \ndriver’s license address. Id. For both driver’s license purposes and voter registration purposes, \nDefendants simply use and store the signature that was electronically captured in the most recent \nprevious in-person DPS transaction. Id. at 899 n.52. Defendants cannot show why handwritten \nsignatures are necessary to confirm voter identity at the polls when collected, stored, and easily-\naccessible electronically-captured signatures do the same thing just as well, if not more efficiently, \nand when Texas already uses these electronic signature for this purpose for in-person and mail-in \nDPS applications. Anderson, 460 U.S. at 806 (quoting Kusper v. Pontikes, 414 U.S. 51, 59 (1973) \n33 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 5   Filed 01/17/20   Page 34 of 48\n \n \n(“If the [s]tate has open to it a less drastic way of satisfying its legitimate interests, it may not \nchoose a legislative scheme that broadly stifles the exercise of fundamental personal liberties.”). \nMoreover, DPS’s online system utilizes a data verification process, which, as Defendants \nhave admitted, allows an online applicant to verify their identity at login, instead of using a \nhandwritten signature. Stringer I, 320 F. Supp. 3d at 878 (“Defendants admit that the personal \ninformation required for authenticating online transactions is equal to or even more rigorous than \nthe identifying information used for in-person and mail-in transactions”). This verification process \nensures that the individual transacting online is the person who previously provided an electronic \nsignature during his last in-person transaction with DPS and would likewise ensure that the \nelectronic signature used for voter registration and voter verification belongs to the proper \nindividual. With no sufficient justification for the State’s restrictions on online transactions, the \nburden on Plaintiffs is unreasonable.  \nII.  Plaintiffs will suffer irreparable injury absent a preliminary injunction and have no \nadequate remedy at law. \n \n“An irreparable injury is one that cannot be undone by monetary damages.” Heil Trailer \nInt'l Co. v. Kula, 542 F. App'x 329, 335 (5th Cir. 2013) (citing DFW Metro Line Servs. v. Sw. Bell, \n901 F.2d 1267, 1269 (5th Cir.1990). Defendants’ arbitrary discrimination against individuals who \nuse Texas’s online driver’s license system irreparably injures Plaintiffs by burdening their voting \nrights, including their right to register to vote under the NVRA. The right to vote, and be properly \nregistered to vote, is one of the most important constitutionally protected rights because it is \n“preservative of all rights,”  Yick Wo v. Hopkins, 118 U.S. 356, 370 (1886), and, “[w]hen an alleged \ndeprivation of a constitutional right is involved, most courts hold that no further showing of \nirreparable injury is necessary.”  Opulent Life Church v. City of Holly Springs, Miss., 697 F.3d \n279, 295 (5th Cir. 2012) (citing 11A Federal Practice and Procedure § 2948.1 (2d ed. 1995)). See \n34 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 5   Filed 01/17/20   Page 35 of 48\n \n \nalso League of Women Voters of United States v. Newby, 838 F.3d 1, 9 (D.C. Cir. 2016) (finding \nthat the challenged electoral practices “unquestionably” made it “more difficult” for plaintiff \norganizations “to accomplish their primary mission of registering voters” and therefore “provide \ninjury for purposes both of standing and irreparable harm”); Charles H. Wesley Educ. Found. Inc. \nv. Cox, 324 F. Supp. 2d 1358, 1368 (N.D. Ga. 2004), aff’d, 408 F.3d 1349 (11th Cir. 2005) (“[N]o \nmonetary award can remedy the fact that [a voter] will not be permitted to vote in the precinct of \nher new residence.”); Williams v. Salerno, 792 F.2d 323, 326 (2d Cir. 1986) (“The registration \napplicants in this case would certainly suffer irreparable harm if their right to vote were impinged \nupon.”). Defendants’ violations of the U.S. Constitution and the NVRA impinge on individual and \norganizational Plaintiffs’ right to vote and register to vote in numerous distinct ways, each of which \nconstitutes an irreparable injury. \nA.  Defendants’ failure to simultaneously register Individual Plaintiffs constitutes an \nirreparable injury and must be remedied by February 3, 2020 in order to be \neffective for the March 3, 2020 Presidential Primary Election. \n \nIndividual Plaintiffs injury-in-fact will become irreparable on February 3, 2020, when they \nwill either be forced to forego their legal right to register to vote under the NVRA or will be totally \nor partially disenfranchised -- in the case of Plaintiff Stringer, for a second time. The NVRA grants \nPlaintiffs a clear right to have their online driver’s license transactions serve to update their voter \nregistrations. Plaintiffs’ successful update of their Texas driver’s license address information using \nthe  DPS  website  should  have  resulted  in  a  simultaneous  application  to  update  their  voter \nregistration  information.  Since  Defendants  have  still  not  updated  Plaintiffs’  registration, \nDefendants continue to violate their legal rights. The violation of Plaintiffs’ rights under the NVRA \nand  U.S.  Constitution  is  quintessentially  non-compensable—  being  forced  to  jump  through \nextraneous hoops in order to exercise a fundamental right has no price tag. The burden is \n35 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 5   Filed 01/17/20   Page 36 of 48\n \n \nparticularly pronounced for Plaintiff Gomez, who owns no home printer to print the off-site voter \nregistration form that DPS links online users to. App’x 185 (Gomez Dep. at ¶ 5). Defendants’ \nviolations disenfranchised Plaintiff Stringer in a previous election and will continue to harm \nindividual Plaintiffs in future election cycles. App’x 179-80 (Stringer Dep. at ¶¶ 11-13); App’x \n186 (Gomez Dep. at ¶ 10); App’x 183 (Harms at ¶ 14).   \nIn order for Plaintiffs’ voter registrations to be effective in time to participate in the March \n3, 2020 Primary Election, they must be considered submitted no later than February 3, 2020. Tex. \nElec. Code § 13.143(e). If Plaintiffs’ updated registration applications are not submitted by the \nrequisite deadline, they will be unable to vote in the March primary elections in which they are \nentitled to vote. Countless Texans just like Plaintiff Stringer in Stringer I are also disenfranchised \neach election because of Defendants’ actions. App’x 190-91 (Finnemore Dep. at ¶¶ 12-15); App’x \n197-98 (Walther Dep. at ¶ 10); App’x 164 (Galloway Dep. at ¶ 14); App’x 168-69 (Elliot Dep. at \n¶ 7); Dkt. 1 Ex. D (Complaints about confusion over online DPS/voter registration system).  \nBecause “there can be no ‘do-over’ or redress of a denial of the right to vote after an election,” an \nNVRA violation that inhibits voting “weighs heavily in determining” irreparable harm absent an \ninjunction. Fish v. Kobach, 840 F.3d 710, 752 (10th Cir. 2016); see also Elrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. \n347, 373 (1976) (election case noting that the loss of constitutional rights “for even minimal \nperiods of time, unquestionably constitutes irreparable injury”). Based on the evidence presented \nwith this Motion, Defendants’ refusal to change the policies and procedures that caused Plaintiffs \ninjury also harmed and will continue to harm similarly situated persons in future elections. \nB.  Defendants’ legal violations cause irreparable harm to Organizational Plaintiffs by \ncausing them to divert resources, undermining their core missions, and impeding \ntheir individual members’ voting rights. \n \n36 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 5   Filed 01/17/20   Page 37 of 48\n \n \ni.  Organizational Plaintiffs are irreparably harmed by being forced to divert \ntheir limited resources to register voters who were denied the opportunity to \nregister when transacting with DPS online.  \n \nDefendants’ NVRA violations result in a distinct irreparable harm because they force \nOrganizational Plaintiffs to divert their resources to ensure individuals who should otherwise be \nproperly registered to vote through DPS online are in fact properly registered. League of Women \nVoters of United States v. Newby, 838 F.3d 1, 9 (D.C. Cir. 2016) (finding that the challenged \nelectoral practices “unquestionably” made it “more difficult” for Organizational Plaintiffs “to \naccomplish their primary mission of registering voters” and therefore “provide injury for purposes \nboth of standing and irreparable harm”). The present case is similar to Action NC vs. Strach, which \nheld that organizational plaintiffs’ diversion of resources away from “voter mobilization and voter \neducation efforts” before Election Day was sufficient to show irreparable harm at the preliminary \ninjunction  stage.  216  F.  Supp.  3d  597,  642–43  (M.D.N.C  2016).  Monetary  relief  cannot \ncompensate for the harm to Plaintiffs’ organizational missions of increasing voter engagement and \nparticipation. Indeed, courts have found that conduct limiting “an organization’s ability to conduct \nvoter registration activities constitutes an irreparable injury,” Project Vote, Inc. v. Kemp, 208 F. \nSupp. 3d 1320, 1350 (N.D. Ga. 2016), “because when a plaintiff loses an opportunity to register a \nvoter, the opportunity is gone forever.” League of Women Voters of Florida v. Browning, 863 F. \nSupp. 2d 1155, 1167 (N.D. Fla. 2012); see also Newby, 838 F.3d at 12-13 (reversing denial of \npreliminary injunction). Each week that Defendants continue to violate the law results in tens of \nthousands  of  individuals  failing  to  be  properly  registered  to  vote33,  and  each  minute  that \n                                                 \n33 Based on roughly 1.5 million Texans renewing their driver’s licenses online or changing their \ndriver’s license addresses online each year, Dkt. 1 Ex. A, which equates to an average of 28,846 \nindividuals a week. The vast majority of these individuals will be eligible voters because anyone \nwho uses the online driver’s license system must be 18 years old and a United States citizen. Texas \n37 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 5   Filed 01/17/20   Page 38 of 48\n \n \nOrganizational Plaintiffs spend helping a person who should have been registered through DPS is \none less minute spent helping other unregistered eligible voters or accomplishing other core \norganizational  activities.  The  fact  that  Plaintiff  LWVTX  is  purely  a  volunteer  organization \nunderscores that the harm caused by Defendants is not monetarily compensable and is hence \nirreparable. App’x 172, 175 (Chimene Dep. at ¶¶ 5, 18).  \nSpecifically, LWVTX spends considerable time and resources assisting voters who have \ninteracted  with  DPS  online  but who  either  remain  unregistered  or  do  not  have  their  voter \nregistration address updated automatically as NVRA Section 5 requires. App’x 173-74 (Chimene \nDep. at ¶ 10, 11); App’x 190-92 (Finnemore Dep. at ¶¶ 4-9, 18-19); App’x 196-98 (Walther Dep. \nat ¶¶ 5-7, 9-11). Voter registration efforts by LWVTX require significant volunteer member hours. \nApp’x 173, 175 (Chimene Dep. at ¶¶ 7-9, 18); App’x 188, 189 (Finnemore Dep. at ¶¶ 3, 6); App’x \n196 (Walther Dep. at ¶ 5). LWVTX members frequently register students on college and university \ncampuses and find these populations particularly vulnerable to harm from Defendants’ violations \nbecause they lack access to printers and are accustomed to transacting all of their business online. \nApp’x 189-90 (Finnemore Dep. at ¶¶ 3-5, 12); App’x 196, 197 (Walther Dep. at ¶¶ 4, 8). LWVTX \nmembers are also active in communities, such as the Texas Hill Country, where many individuals \nfrequently move from other Texas counties and need to be registered to vote because they were \nunable to do so when updating their driver’s licenses. App’x 189 (Finnemore Dep. at ¶¶ 6-8). If \nthe Defendants ceased violating the law, LWVTX would be able to expend less time and money \nensuring that Texas residents who renew or update their address with DPS online are properly \nregistered at the correct address, and would instead be able to spend this time registering more \n                                                 \nDepartment of Public Safety, Change Your Address Online, DPS.Texas.gov (last visited Jan. 12, \n2020), http://www.dps.texas.gov/DriverLicense/dlfork.aspx?action=change. \n38 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 5   Filed 01/17/20   Page 39 of 48\n \n \nvoters. App’x 175 (Chimene Dep. at ¶ 18); App’x 192 (Finnemore Dep. at ¶ 24); App’x 198 \n(Walther Dep. at ¶ 11). Further, LWVTX would be able to dedicate more resources on its other \nactivities, including educating and informing voters about ballot measures, issues and candidates, \nand pursuing policy and advocacy goals in other issue areas. See, e.g., App’x 172-75 (Chimene \nDep. at ¶¶ 6, 8, 13, 14, 18); App’x 190-92 (Finnemore Dep. at ¶¶ 11-24). \nSimilarly, Plaintiff MOVE Texas must divert their resources to fill the gap caused by \nDefendants’ violations, particularly because MOVE Texas assists voters who move frequently—\nnamely young voters. App’x 162-64 (Galloway Dep. at ¶¶ 3, 6-9, 11-12); App’x 167-68 (Elliot \nDep. at ¶ 3). MOVE Texas has expended time and resources working with numerous individuals \nwho have moved and updated their address with DPS online, but whose voter registration address \nwas not automatically updated by the SOS. App’x 163-65 (Galloway Dep. at ¶¶ 9-13, 15); App’x \n168-70 (Elliott Dep. at ¶¶ 4-5, 7-10, 12). The time and resources MOVE Texas expends on address \nupdates acutely reduces the work it can do in other areas, such as engaging in GOTV activities, \neducating voters about important issue areas and candidates, leadership-building in young voter \ncommunities, and advocating for workers’ rights. App’x 165 (Galloway Dep. at ¶ 15); App’x 170 \n(Elliott Dep. at ¶ 12). And it greatly reduces the time that MOVE Texas can spend registering new \nvoters who are not already registered to vote. Because Defendants continue to violate the law, \nMOVE Texas’s diversion of resources to compensate for this harm will be ongoing, and the harm \nto MOVE Texas’s GOTV and voter-education activities will be highest as the March 2020 Primary \nElection gets closer. \nii.  Defendants’ legal violations cause confusion and disenfranchisement at the \npolls, thus irreparably harming Organizational Plaintiffs by undermining \ntheir voter engagement efforts. \n \n39 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 5   Filed 01/17/20   Page 40 of 48\n \n \nDue to Defendants’ illegal online driver’s license application process, countless individuals \neach election are disenfranchised when they show up to vote mistakenly believing they registered \nthrough DPS online. App’x 190-91 (Finnemore Dep. at ¶¶ 12-15); App’x 164 (Galloway Dep. at \n¶ 13); App’x 168-69 (Elliot Dep. at ¶ 7); App’x 197-98 (Walther Dep. at ¶ 10); Dkt. 1 Ex. D \n(Complaints  about  confusion  over  online  DPS/voter  registration  system).  This  directly  and \nirreparably harms Organizational Plaintiffs by undermining their core missions and undoing the \nwork they put into voter education, GOTV, and election protection efforts.  \nIt is commonplace for Organizational Plaintiffs  to encounter individuals who mistakenly \nbelieve they registered to vote or updated their registrations through DPS online. App’x 189-91 \n(Finnemore Dep. at ¶¶ 4, 8, 12, 18); App’x 196, 197-98 (Walther Dep. at ¶¶ 5, 9, 10); App’x 163-\n64 (Galloway Dep. at ¶¶ 11,13); App’x 168-69 (Elliot Dep. at ¶¶ 4-5, 7-8). So much so that \nOrganizational Plaintiffs  have developed training protocols and produced educational materials \naimed at informing the public that DPS does not— contrary to how it may seem— offer online \nvoter registration services, and actively spend time training their members and disseminating this \ninformation to the public. App’x 164 (Galloway Dep. at ¶ 12); App’x 169 (Elliot Dep. at ¶ 10); \nApp’x 174 (Chimene ¶ 12); App’x 190-91 (Finnemore Dep. at ¶ 12). Organizational Plaintiffs \noften come across individuals who have been disenfranchised in the past as a result of mistakenly \nbelieving they registered through DPS online. App’x 190-91 (Finnemore Dep. at ¶¶ 12-15); App’x \n197-98 (Walther Dep. at ¶ 10); App’x 164 (Galloway Dep. at ¶ 12); App’x 168-69 (Elliot Dep. at \n¶ 7).  Many of the individuals who mistakenly believe they registered or updated their registrations \nend  up  casting  provisional  ballots.  App’x  190-91  (Finnemore  Dep.  at  ¶  12).  The  harm  is \ncompounded in Texas, because—unlike other states such as Arizona, Ohio, California, and New \nYork—Texas does not allow provisional ballots to be partially counted if they were submitted \n40 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 5   Filed 01/17/20   Page 41 of 48\n \n \noutside the correct voting jurisdiction. National Conference of State Legislatures, Provisional \nBallots,  NCSL.Org  (Oct.  15,  2018),  https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-\ncampaigns/provisional-ballots.aspx. Organizational Plaintiffs contact many individuals through a \nvariety of direct and indirect means and are not able to verify the registration status of each would-\nbe voter they contact. App’x 164 (Galloway Dep. at ¶ 13); App’x 168 (Elliott Dep. at ¶ 6); App’x \n172-74 (Chimene ¶¶ 6-9, 13). Organizational Plaintiffs’ missions of mobilizing the electorate, and \nthe resources they expend on voter education, GOTV efforts, and election protection efforts are \nirreparably  injured  when  voters  that  they  have  contacted  show  up  to  vote  only  to  be \ndisenfranchised. App’x 164-65 (Galloway Dep. at ¶ 13, 15); App’x 168-70 (Elliott Dep. at ¶¶ 7, \n12); App’x 174-75 (Chimene ¶¶ 13, 14, 18); App’x 190-91 (Finnemore Dep. at ¶ 12-13).  \niii.  Plaintiff LWVTX has individual members who are irreparably injured by \nDefendants’ violations by being unable to register to vote or update their \nregistrations when transacting with DPS online. \n \nFinally, individual members of Plaintiff LWVTX are among the approximately 1.5 million \nTexans harmed each and every year by Defendants’ ongoing NVRA violations. Dkt. 1 Ex. A. With \napproximately 3,000 members statewide, App’x 172, 175 (Chimene Dep. at ¶¶ 4, 15), numerous \nmembers every year move or renew their driver’s license. As the State continues to push people to \nuse its online driver’s license services, it is inevitable that more and more LWV members will \ncontinuously have their rights violated by Defendants’ failures to comply with the law. For \nexample, one individual member of LWV who has moved from one Texas county to another, \nupdated their driver’s license address online, and has yet to have their voter registration updated. \nApp’x 175 (Chimene Dep. ¶ 17). Moreover, they also have members with Texas driver’s licenses \nwho are likely to move in the future, or will need to renew their driver’s licenses, and will be \n41 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 5   Filed 01/17/20   Page 42 of 48\n \n \nharmed by Defendants’ failure to ensure that their voter registration address is updated anytime \nthey report a move or renew their licenses online. App’x 175 (Chimene Dep. at ¶¶ 15, 16).  \nThe harm caused by Defendants’ failure to comply with the NVRA is very real to \nIndividual Plaintiffs, Organizational Plaintiffs, individual members of Associational Plaintiff and \nto  countless  other  Texas  voters.  It  not  only  imposes  a  heavy  burden  on  these  voters  and \norganizations, but also presents a threat of disenfranchisement. In the absence of preliminary relief, \nPlaintiffs and other Texans, therefore, face irreparable harm. Every election is important. The \ninability to participate in an election cannot be compensated for after the fact or assuaged by the \nability to participate in the next election. Irreparable harm will inevitably result without the \npreliminary injunctive relief Plaintiffs seek. Defendants’ failure to remedy ongoing violations of \nthe NVRA, despite Plaintiffs’ notice, demonstrates that the SOS will not take action to protect the \nright to vote in the 2020 Primary or General Election absent injunctive relief from this Court. \nFurther, without injunctive relief, Defendants’ violations of the NVRA will indelibly impact the \n2020 Primary and General Election—denying certain voters the ability to participate in the \npolitical process and unwarrantedly consuming precious resources. \nIII.  The threatened injury to Plaintiffs far outweighs any potential harm to Defendants \n \nThe balance of hardships weighs heavily in favor of Plaintiffs’ requested preliminary \ninjunction. Defendants are actively engaging in the violation of federal law. Defendants are \nviolating  Plaintiffs’  and  countless  eligible  Texas  voters’  statutory  and  constitutional  rights. \nCharles H. Wesley Educ. Foundation, Inc., 408 F.3d at 1355 (protection of Plaintiffs’ franchise-\nrelated rights is “significant”). The harm resulting from these violations and the potential denial of \nan injunction is severe and irreparable, while any hardship to Defendants should the injunction be \ngranted amounts to, at most, administrative inconvenience. \n42 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 5   Filed 01/17/20   Page 43 of 48\n \n \nThe sheer number of voters negatively impacted because of Defendants’ actions could mar \nthe integrity of the election process as a whole. Absent a preliminary injunction, potentially 50,000 \nor more eligible Texans who completed online DPS transactions and could have been registered \nto vote before the Primary Election and at least 1 million eligible Texans who could have been \nregistered to vote before the Presidential Election will not receive this federally-mandated option \nfrom Defendants.34 Additionally, because the online DPS driver’s license system continues to \nconfuse eligible Texans into mistakenly thinking that they have registered to vote after using the \nsystem, a segment of the voters who use the DPS online driver’s license system before the Primary \nElection or the Presidential Election will ultimately suffer disenfranchisement. App’x 190-91 \n(Finnemore Dep. at ¶¶ 12-15); App’x 197-98 (Walther Dep. at ¶ 10); App’x 164 (Galloway Dep. \nat ¶ 13); App’x 168-69 (Elliott Dep. at ¶ 7); see also Obama for Am. v. Husted, 697 F.3d 423, 436 \n(6th Cir. 2012) (potential disenfranchisement “outweighs any corresponding burden on the State, \nwhich has not shown that [it] will be unable to cope” with plaintiffs’ requested relief).  \n Allowing an online driver’s license change-of-address or renewal application to also serve \nas a voter registration application—whenever a DPS applicant requests that option—will not \nrequire additional safeguards because use of these online applications is already restricted to U.S. \nCitizens who are at least 18 years of age, two factors that track with the core requirements for \nvoting. The only harm Defendants would suffer—specifically the administrative inconvenience of \nimplementing a simple, quick, and inexpensive fix—pales in comparison to the harm imposed by \ntheir  legal  violations.  See  Taylor  v.  Louisiana,  419  U.S.  522,  535  (1975)  (“administrative \nconvenience” cannot justify the deprivation of a constitutional right). In Stringer I, Defendants \nacknowledged “that permitting simultaneous voter applications for motor voters that renew or \n                                                 \n34 Based on 1.5 million individuals renewing or updating their driver’s license online each year.  \n43 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 5   Filed 01/17/20   Page 44 of 48\n \n \nchange their driver's license online would be technologically very feasible and the cost would be \nminimal.” 320 F. Supp. 3d at 900 n.55 (“from an IT perspective, DPS is currently capable of \nsending the voter data and electronic signature to SOS”). In the unlikely event that Defendants \nlater prevail, it will be an easy matter for them to restart the implementation of their current policy, \nwhich can be switched back as simply, quickly, and inexpensively as it can be brought into \ncompliance with the NVRA.  \nIV. The injunction will not disserve the public interest. \n  “The right to vote freely for the candidate of one's choice is of the essence of a democratic \nsociety, and any restrictions on that right strike at the heart of representative government.” \nReynolds v. Simms, 377 U.S. 533, 544 (1964). Requiring Defendant to follow Federal law and \nuphold Plaintiffs’ “franchise-related rights is without question in the public interest.”  Charles H. \nWesley Educ. Foundation, Inc., 408 F.3d at 1355; see also Obama for America., 697 F.3d 423, \n436 (“[T]he public has a strong interest in exercising the fundamental political right to vote.”) \n(internal quotation marks and citations omitted). There is extraordinary public interest in protecting \nthe fundamental right to vote. See, e.g., Wesberry v. Sanders, 376 U.S. 1, 17 (1964), 376 U.S. at \n17; League of Women Voters U.S. v. Newby, 838 F.3d 1, 12 (2016) (“The public has a ‘strong \ninterest in exercising the fundamental political right to vote . . . .’”) (quoting Purcell v. Gonzalez, \n549 U.S. 1, 4 (2006)); see also Jackson Women’s Health Org. v. Currier, 760 F.3d 448, 458 n.9 \n(5th Cir. 2014) (district court did not abuse its discretion in finding injunction would not disserve \npublic interest because it will prevent constitutional deprivations); De Leon v. Perry, 975 F. Supp. \n2d 632, 665 (W.D. Tex. 2014), aff’d sub nom. De Leon v. Abbott, 791 F.3d 619 (5th Cir. 2015). A \npreliminary injunction would further that interest by preventing voter disenfranchisement and \npermitting participation of eligible voters in the upcoming elections. See, e.g., Newby, 838 F.3d at \n12 (concluding that public interest favors preliminary relief where, absent such relief “there is a \n44 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 5   Filed 01/17/20   Page 45 of 48\n \n \nsubstantial risk that citizens will be disenfranchised” in upcoming elections); League of Women \nVoters of N. Carolina v. North Carolina, 769 F.3d 224, 247–48 (4th Cir. 2014) (quoting Obama \nfor Am. v. Husted, 697 F.3d 423, 437 (6th Cir. 2012)) (“By definition, ‘[t]he public interest ... \nfavors permitting as many qualified voters to vote as possible.’”). Using online driver’s license \napplications for voter registration purposes will protect the voting rights of countless individuals, \nlimit  voter  disenfranchisement,  make  voter  registration  more  accessible,  and  foster  a  more \ndemocratic elections process. Complaints to DPS from Plaintiffs and many similarly situated \npersons about this issue will also end. Therefore, a preliminary injunction would best serve the \npublic interest. \nCONCLUSION AND PRAYER FOR RELIEF \n  For all the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs respectfully request a hearing on this matter and \nfor this Court to issue a preliminary injunction directing Defendants to take all appropriate \nmeasures necessary to remedy the harm caused by their noncompliance with the National Voter \nRegistration  Act  and  the  U.S.  Constitution  by  providing  and  accepting  simultaneous  voter \nregistration applications in elections for Federal office from driver’s license applicants who wish \nto register to vote while renewing or changing the address on their driver’s license through the \nDepartment of Public Safety website.  \nPlaintiffs further respectfully request this Court to issue a preliminary injunction preventing \nDefendants,  and  all  those  associated  with  them,  from  discriminating  against,  harassing,  or \ninterfering with the right of each Individual Plaintiff, affected members of Associational Plaintiff, \nand other eligible Texans to simultaneously apply to register to vote when submitting a renewal or \nchange-of-address driver’s license application through the Department of Public Safety website.  \n45 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 5   Filed 01/17/20   Page 46 of 48\n \n \nPlaintiffs further respectfully request this Court to issue a preliminary injunction directing \nDefendants to register to vote or update voter registration information for each Individual Plaintiff \nusing their most recent online driver’s license transaction and deem each Individual Plaintiff’s \nvoter registration through their most recent online driver’s license transaction as submitted on the \ndate each Individual Plaintiff completed said transaction, and as effective 30 days thereafter.   \n  Plaintiffs also pray that this Court grant all additional relief to which he may be entitled, at \nlaw or equity.  \n \nDated: January 17, 2020        Respectfully submitted,  \n  \n /s/ Mimi Marziani   \nMimi Marziani \nTexas Bar No. 24091906 \nmimi@texascivilrightsproject.org \nRebecca Harrison Stevens \nTexas Bar No. 24065381 \nbeth@texascivilrightsproject.org \nHani Mirza \nTexas Bar No. 24083512 \nhani@texascivilrightsproject.org \nRyan Cox \nTexas Bar No. 24074087 \nryan@texascivilrightsproject.org \nJoaquin Gonzalez \nTexas Bar No. 24109935  \nJoaquin@texascivilrightsproject.org  \n \nTEXAS CIVIL RIGHTS PROJECT \n1405 Montopolis Drive \nAustin, Texas 78741 \nTel.

McCRAW, in his official \ncapacity as Director of the Texas Department \nof Public Safety \nJARROD STRINGER, et. al. \nV. \nV \nRUTH HUGHS, in her official capacity  CIVIL NO. SA-20-CV-46-OG \nas Texas Secretary of State and STEVEN C \nMcCRAW, in his official capacity as \nDirector of the Texas Department of \nPublic Safety \nORDER \nIn response to Defendants' objection to consolidation, the Court has considered the issue of \nseverance. As noted in the consolidation order, the claims before the Court are identical to the claims \nin Stringer I.  Defendants' practices and procedures have not changed, and the only new issue is \nwhether the current plaintiffs have standing. Thus, it is anticipated that both the Court and the parties \nwill refer to and rely upon much of the evidence in Stringer i in resolving the merits. To avoid the \nwaste ofjudicial resources, the Court consolidated the two cause numbers. Yet Defendants continue \nto argue that the Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over the current claims, due in part to the \nconsolidation. To be clear, the Court's subject matterjurisdiction does not arise from a cause number \nassigned by the Clerk of Court. Docketing the current claims under  6-CV-257 or 20-C V.46 makes \n1 \nno difference whatsoever. However, the waste of time and resources on the issue of consolidation \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 13   Filed 02/13/20   Page 2 of 2\nis exactly what the Court attempted to avoid. \nIt is therefore ORDERED that the above styled cause numbers are SEVERED. This order \nshall be docketed in both 16-CV  -257 and 20-C V-46, and the following docket entries in 16-C V-257 \nshall be duplicated and docketed in 20-C V-46 by the Clerk of the Court: 123-134, 136-138, 140-167, \nand all text orders within this docket entry range.' The motion to intervene was construed as a \nrequest to intervene in the Stringer II claims, and was granted on that basis; thus, it shall be deemed \npart of the record in 20-C V-46. \nIt is further ORDERED that the parties may continue to refer to evidence in  6-CV-257 as \n1 \nnecessary and appropriate, rather than filing duplicate copies of such evidence. All future filings will \nbe docketed under 20-C V-46. \nSIGNED and ENTERED this  \"  day of February, 2020. \nORLANDO L. GARCIA \nCHIEF U.S. DISTRICT JUDGE \n1The Court has omitted docket no. 135, the consolidation order, because it was docketed in both \ncause numbers and docket no. 139, which dismisses the Stringer I claims pursuant to the Fifth Circuit's \njudgment and mandate. Docketing all other documents in 20-.CV-46 imposes a burden on the Clerk of the \nCourt but alleviates the burden on the parties to re-file documents they have already filed. \n2 ",

By refusing to offer a simultaneous voter \nregistration application to those who renew or update their driver’s licenses online, Defendants \nintentionally exclude thousands of eligible Texas voters from the democratic process each election \ncycle. Until Defendants are forced to reform their registration practices, large numbers of Texas \nvoters will continue to remain unregistered and be disenfranchised. Defendants continually attempt \nto distract the Court from this grave reality with arguments lacking any basis in law and by offering \ndisingenuous  descriptions  of  their  own  policies  and  exaggerations  of  Plaintiffs’  proposed \n1 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 64   Filed 03/30/20   Page 2 of 34\n \n \nremedies. Defendants’ arguments in their motion to dismiss are no exception, and have largely \nbeen rejected by this Court in a previous iteration of this case. See Order Denying Motion To \nDismiss, Stringer v. Pablos, No. 5:16-cv-00257, Doc. 52 (Mar. 31, 2017).  For all the reasons \nbelow, Plaintiffs respectfully request that the Court deny Defendants’ motion to dismiss. \n \nBACKGROUND \n \nThe central fact of this case has never been disputed: when eligible Texans update their \ndriver’s licenses online with the Texas Department of Public Safety (“DPS”), they are not offered \na simultaneous application to register to vote or update their voter registration information.1 As \nthe Court previously held, the NVRA requires that each driver’s license application, including any \nrenewal application, simultaneously serve as an application for voter registration, and that each \nchange-of-address form be used to update the voter’s registration records. See Stringer v. Pablos, \n320 F. Supp. 3d 862, 891 (W.D. Tex. 2018), rev’d and remanded on other grounds, 942 F.3d 715 \n(5th Cir. 2019). \n  DPS  operates  offices  around  the  state  and  issues  driver’s  licenses  and  other  state \nidentification cards. DPS’s protocol for providing voter registration to applicants who interact with \nDPS in person and for applicants who utilize DPS’s mail-in change-of-address form is in line with \nNVRA requirements. 2  DPS’s online renewal and change-of-address form does not, however, \nserve as a simultaneous voter registration application.3 DPS in-person applicants must fill out the \n                                                \n1 As Defendants put it, “[t]he key facts of this case are not disputed.” Defs.’ Reply in Supp. of Mot. \nto Dismiss at 6, Stringer I, No. 5:16-cv-00257 (Jun. 06, 2016); see also Joint Report on Alternative \nDispute Resolution at 2, Stringer I, No. 5:16-cv-00257-OLG (Sep. 9, 2016) (stating that the parties \nagree “that their primary dispute is legal, rather than factual”). \n2 See Doc. 5-1 at 51-53 (Texas Department of Public Safety Implementation Plan, D_00021063 at \nD_00021065); Stringer I, 320 F.

In fact voter registration forms and the \nrelevant DPS online transactions both require: date of birth, Texas driver’s license number, \nresidence address, residence city, residence zip code, residence county and, if it differs from \n                                                \n15 Doc. 5-1 at 153 (Ex. 20, DPS’s Suppl.

Standard of Review \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a)(2) requires only “a short and plain statement of the \nclaim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.” See Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombley, 550 U.S. \n544 (2007); Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662 (2009).

First, the Court should \nonly grant a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction “if it appears certain that the \nplaintiff cannot prove any set of facts in support of his [or her] claim that would entitle plaintiff to \nrelief.” Ramming v. United States, 281 F.3d 158, 161 (5th Cir. 2001) (citing Home Builders Ass’n \nof Miss., Inc. v. City of Madison, Miss., 143 F.3d 1006, 1010 (5th Cir.1998)). Second, motions to \ndismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) are generally “viewed with disfavor and [are] rarely granted.” Leal v. \nMcHugh, 731 F.3d 405, 410 (5th Cir. 2013). Where a defendant challenges a plaintiff’s statutory \nstanding, courts apply the Rule 12(b)(6) standard, which requires the defendant to show that the \nplaintiff failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. Harold H. Huggins Realty, Inc. \nv. FNC, Inc., 634 F.3d 787, 795 n.2 (5th Cir. 2011). \nII. The Court has jurisdiction. \na.  Individual Plaintiffs have standing. \nDefendants  are  correct  that  standing  requires  (1)  an  actual  or  imminent,  concrete, \nparticularized injury-in-fact that is (2) fairly traceable to Defendants’ conduct and (3) redressable \nby plaintiffs’ requested relief. MTD at 3 (citing Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Envt’l. Servs. \n(TOC), Inc., 528 U.S. 167, 180-81 (2000). They collapse the injury-in-fact and redressability \ncomponents, claiming that Individual Plaintiffs’ injuries are not redressable because they were \nsuffered  in  the  past  and  are  not  ongoing  or  imminent.  This  stems  from  Defendants’ \nmischaracterization of Plaintiffs’ injuries. Further, they claim Plaintiffs’ injuries are not traceable \n8 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 64   Filed 03/30/20   Page 9 of 34\n \n \nto Defendants because Plaintiffs could have found alternative means for registering to vote—an \nargument this Court has already considered and soundly rejected.  \nDefendants mischaracterize Individual Plaintiffs injuries by failing to recognize that “[t]he \nexistence of federal jurisdiction ordinarily depends on the facts as they exist when the complaint \nis filed.” Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 569 n.4 (emphasis in original). The crucial \nfact establishing a redressable injury is that “it is undisputed that Plaintiffs Stringer, Gomez, and \nHarms were not simultaneously registered to vote (i.e., their voter registration was not updated) at \nthe time of their online transactions with DPS, a designated voter registration agency[, and it] is \nundisputed that they [were] still unregistered to vote [at the time of filing] and [would] be \ndisenfranchised on March 3 if they [were] not registered to vote by the deadline - February 3.”  \nOrder, Stringer v. Whitley, No.: 5:16-cv-00257-OLG, Doc. 156 at 14–15 (W.D. Tex.  Jan. 30, \n2020); see also Doc.1 at ¶¶ 49-53. Defendants entirely elide this fact because it is prima facie clear \nthat not being properly registered to vote constitutes a concrete, continuing injury sufficient to \nconfer standing. See generally Charles H. Wesley Educ. Found., Inc. v. Cox, 408 F.3d 1349, 1352 \n(11th Cir. 2005) (“[Plaintiff’s] alleged injuries flow directly from the denial of her registration \nform.”); Common Cause of Colorado v. Buescher, 750 F. Supp. 2d 1259, 1271 (D. Colo. 2010). \n(“Any burden on the right to vote, even if it is no more than the cancellation of a voter’s records \nin violation of the NVRA, constitutes an injury-in-fact for standing purposes.”). Simply having to \njump through an extraneous hoop to register to  vote,  in  contravention of the NVRA, itself \nconstitutes an injury-in-fact. See Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 514 (1975) (noting that “Congress \nmay create a statutory right . . . the alleged deprivation of which can confer standing to sue . . . .”); \nWilliams v. Salerno, 792 F.2d 323, 328 (2d Cir. 1986) (holding that applying “more vigorous \nregistration requirements than are generally applied” constituted judicially cognizable injury).  \n9 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 64   Filed 03/30/20   Page 10 of 34\n \n \nIn Stringer I, the Fifth Circuit held that the past circumstance of having transacted with \nDPS online without a simultaneous opportunity to register to vote did not suffice to confer standing \nwhen plaintiffs had already cured their situation by registering to vote at their correct address \nbefore filing suit. See Stringer v. Whitley, 942 F.3d 715, 719-21 (5th Cir. 2019). That decision \nunderscores that Plaintiffs here have proper standing, as they were still not properly registered at \nthe time of filing their suit due to Defendants’ illegal conduct. Further, Plaintiffs have standing \nbecause,  when  they  filed  suit,  they  faced  the  immediate  threat  of  complete  or  partial \ndisenfranchisement in the March 3, 2020 Primary Election. See Stringer v. Whitley, 942 F.3d 715, \n720-21  (5th  Cir.  2019)  (“[P]laintiffs  seeking  injunctive  and  declaratory  relief  can  satisfy  the \nredressability requirement . . . by demonstrating a . . .threatened future injury. . . . For a threatened \nfuture injury to satisfy the imminence requirement, there must be at least a “substantial risk” that the \ninjury will occur.”).23 \nFurther,  Individual  Plaintiffs’  injuries  are  directly  traceable  to  Defendants’  conduct, \nbecause “but for Defendants failure to comply with the NVRA, and the unjustified burden on \nPlaintiffs’ constitutional rights, Plaintiffs would already [have been] registered to vote in the \n                                                \n23 Though Defendants do not raise the issue, it should be noted that Plaintiffs have not lost standing \nto pursue a permanent injunction for a complete systemic fix simply because this Court, subsequent \nto the filing of this suit, ordered Defendants’ to register them to vote; nor is their case moot. See \nUnited States v. W. T. Grant Co., 345 U.S. 629, 633 (1953) (“The necessary determination [to \ncontinue for consideration of a permanent injunction] is that there exists some cognizable danger \nof recurrent violation, something more than the mere possibility which serves to keep the case \nalive.”); Turner v. Rogers, 564 U.S. 431, 439–40 (2011) (“A dispute falls into th[e capable of \nrepetition yet evading review] category, and a case based on that dispute remains live, if “(1) the \nchallenged action [is] in its duration too short to be fully litigated prior to its cessation or expiration, \nand (2) there [is] a reasonable expectation that the same complaining party [will] be subjected to \nthe same action again.”). These standards are lower than the “substantial risk” standard for \ninitiating a suit. Each Individual Plaintiff alleged (and later declared) they intend to use the Texas \nonline driver’s license system to change their address or renew their driver’s license in the future \nand would use the system to update their voter registration or re-register should their registration \nhave become ineffective. Plaintiff Stringer has concrete plans to move again within the year. Doc. \n1 at ¶ 50. \n10 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 64   Filed 03/30/20   Page 11 of 34\n \n \ncounty and precinct where they reside.” Stringer v. Whitley, Doc. 156 at 14–15 (W.D. Tex. Jan. \n30, 2020) (order). Defendants contend that they did not cause Plaintiffs’ injuries because Plaintiffs \ncould have registered to vote through alternative means. However, this Court previously made \nclear:  \nThe mandates of the NVRA dictate exactly the opposite of what Defendants now \nsuggest Plaintiffs should do to avoid being disenfranchised on March 3: engage in \na second transaction with another agency, which requires a separate application \nwith  duplicate  information  and  the  burden  of  mail,  postage,  and/or  personal \ndelivery. Congress lifted these burdens to make voter registration easier, not more \nconfusing and difficult. \n \nId. at 10. For these same reasons, the fact that Plaintiffs’ future moves might be within the same \ncounty, see MTD at 6–7, is of no consequence because they will still have to take extra measures—\nincluding visiting a separate website, printing out a form, filling it out, and mailing it at their own \nexpense—to register to vote at their correct address or be forced to vote in the wrong precinct \n(which would likely result in voting in electoral contests for candidates who do not represent them). \nFinally, Defendants attempt to cast doubt on the sufficiency of Plaintiffs’ evidence as it \nrelates to establishing individual standing. See, e.g., MTD at 5 (quoting Miss. State Democratic \nParty v. Barbour, 529 F.3d 538, 545 (5th Cir. 2008) (“‘[S]tanding is not created by a declaration \nin court pleadings.’ Stringer’s allegations regarding his ‘substantial risk’ of reinjury amount to \nnothing  more  than  his  own  ipse  dixit,  and  without  any  supporting  facts,  cannot  establish \nstanding.”). Even at a later stage of litigation, the undisputed facts would suffice to establish \nstanding; but here, at the pleading stage a court assumes the facts alleged in the Complaint as true. \nSee supra Section I.  \nb.  MOVE Texas Civic Fund and the League of Women Voters of Texas (collectively \n“Organizational Plaintiffs”) Have Organizational Standing. \n \ni.  Organizational Plaintiffs Satisfy the Injury-in-Fact Requirement for Their Claims. \n11 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 64   Filed 03/30/20   Page 12 of 34\n \n \nPlaintiffs MOVE Texas Civic Fund (“MOVE”) and the League of Women Voters of Texas \n(“LWVTX”) allege an injury-in-fact on their own behalf as to their NVRA and constitutional \nclaims against Defendants. “[T]he injury in fact requirement under Article III is qualitative, not \nquantitative, in nature.” OCA-Greater Houston v. Texas, 867 F.3d 604, 612 (5th Cir. 2017) (citing \nAss’n of Cmty. Organizations for Reform Now v. Fowler, 178 F.3d 305, 357–58) (5th Cir. 1999)) \n(internal quotation marks and brackets omitted). So while an injury-in-fact must be (a) concrete \nand particularized and (b) actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical, “it need not measure \nmore than an ‘identifiable trifle.’” OCA-Greater Houston, 867 F.3d at 612 (quoting Fowler, 178 \nF.3d at 358). Applying this understanding in the context of organizational standing, the Fifth \nCircuit has explained that “an organization has standing to sue on its own behalf where it devotes \nresources to counteract a defendant’s allegedly unlawful practices.” Fowler, 178 F.3d at 360. If a \ndefendant’s actions perceptibly impair an organization in such a way, “there can be no question \nthat the organization has suffered injury in fact.” Havens Realty Corp. v. Coleman, 455 U.S. 363, \n379 (1982).  \nThus, in OCA-Greater Houston, the Fifth Circuit held that an advocacy organization—the \nOrganization for Chinese Americans (OCA)—had standing to challenge a Texas law restricting \nthe “interpretation assistance that English-limited voters may receive.” 867 F.3d at 606, 612. The \ncourt held that the organization had suffered an injury-in-fact, even though the “injury was not \nlarge,” because the Texas statute at issue “‘perceptibly impaired’ [the organization’s] ability to \n‘get out the vote’” when the organization “went out of its way to counteract the effect of Texas’s \nallegedly unlawful” statute by educating voters on how to avoid being negatively impacted by the \nstatute. Id. at 612. And in Ass’n of Cmty. Organizations for Reform Now v. Fowler, the Fifth Circuit \nheld  that  an  advocacy  and  voter  registration  organization—the  Association  of  Community \n12 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 64   Filed 03/30/20   Page 13 of 34\n \n \nOrganizations for Reform Now (ACORN)—had standing to challenge the state’s violation of \nSection 7 of the NVRA. 178 F.3d at 360-62. The court held that ACORN had suffered an injury-\nin-fact because  \nACORN . . . presented evidence that it . . . expended resources registering voters in \nlow registration areas who would have already been registered if the [state] had \ncomplied with the requirement under the NVRA that [the state] must make voter \nregistration material available at public aid offices. \n \nId. at 360. \nJust like the organizational plaintiffs in OCA-Greater Houston and Fowler, Plaintiffs have \nstanding to challenge Defendants’ actions. As alleged in the Complaint, Organizational Plaintiffs \nhave  gone  “out of  [their]  way  to  counteract  Texas’s  allegedly  unlawful  [voter  registration \nrestriction  on  online  DPS  customers],”  by  diverting  resources  from  their  activities  toward \n“educat[ing] DPS customers who update the address on and/or renew their driver’s license through \nthe DPS website and mistakenly believe their online DPS transaction simultaneously registered \nthem to vote that they are not in fact registered to vote.” Compl. ¶¶ 56, 59, 60, 62, 63;24 See OCA-\nGreater Houston, 867 F.3d at 606, 612 ([Plaintiff] undertook to educate voters about Texas’s \n[violations]—an undertaking that consumed its time and resources in a way they would not have \nbeen spent absent the Texas law.).

Defendants  Misinterpret  the  Injury-in-Fact  Requirements  for  Organizational \nStanding. \n \nDefendants mischaracterize the Fifth Circuit’s decision in N.A.A.C.P. v. City of Kyle as \nrequiring that an organizational plaintiff must identify “‘specific projects that [it] had to put on \n                                                \n26 See also Doc. 5-1 at 168 ¶ 12, 175-76 ¶ 18; 182 ¶ 12, 192 ¶ 24. \n27 See also Doc. 5-1 at 165-68; 170-73; 175-79, 191-96. \n28 See also Doc. 5-1 at 166-68 ¶¶ 10, 11, 15; 171-73 ¶¶ 5, 7, 9, 12; 176-82 ¶¶ 10, 11, 18; 193-95 \n¶¶ 10, 19, 24. \n29 See Doc. 5-1 at 168 ¶ 12; 178-79 ¶ 18; 182 ¶ 12; 195 ¶ 24. \n30 See Doc. 5-1 at 165-68; 170-73;175-79; 191-96. \n \n14 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 64   Filed 03/30/20   Page 15 of 34\n \n \nhold or otherwise curtail in order to respond to’ the defendants conduct” to establish standing. See \nMTD at  9 (quoting 626 F.3d 233, 238 (5th Cir. 2010)) (citation omitted)). Indeed, the Fifth Circuit \nin OCA-Greater Houston disagreed with this very interpretation of the language from City of Kyle \nand clarified that the court’s “remark [in City of Kyle] . . . was not a heightening of the Lujan \nstandard, but an example of how to satisfy it by pointing to a non-litigation-related expense.” 867 \nF.3d at 612. Defendants also incorrectly claim that City of Kyle requires an organizational plaintiff \nto divert “significant resources to counteract the defendant’s conduct such that any defendant’s \nconduct significantly . . . impaired the organization’s ability to conduct its routine activities.” MTD \nat 11 (quoting City of Kyle, 626 F.3d at 237) (emphasis, quotation marks, and citation omitted). \nHowever, the OCA-Greater Houston panel explained that “the Supreme Court has commanded \nthat, in determining whether an organization has organizational standing, ‘we conduct the same \ninquiry as in the case of an individual,’” which requires that an “injury alleged as an Article III \ninjury-in-fact need not be substantial.” 867 F.3d at 612 (quoting Havens Realty Corp., 455 U.S. at \n378; citing Fowler, 178 F.3d at 358) (“to the extent that Texas would read City of Kyle as imposing \na higher burden on organizations seeking to establish standing, we must disagree.”). \nDefendants additionally claim that because “voter registration, education, and outreach are \nalready central to these organizations’ ‘routine activities,’” Organizational Plaintiffs’ activities do \n“not amount to a ‘concrete and demonstrable’ injury.” MTD at 12. But Organizational Plaintiffs’ \nefforts need not fall outside the scope of their mission or central initiatives to be actions that \ncounteract Defendants’ unlawful conduct. See, e.g., Fla. State Conf. of N.A.A.C.P. v. Browning, \n522 F.3d 1153, 1165 (11th Cir. 2008) (quoting Crawford v. Marion Cty. Election Bd., 472 F.3d \n949, 951 (7th Cir. 2007) (“[A]n organization suffers an injury in fact when a statute ‘compel[s]’ it \nto divert more resources to accomplishing its goals” and “‘[t]he fact that the added cost has not \n15 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 64   Filed 03/30/20   Page 16 of 34\n \n \nbeen estimated and may be slight does not affect standing, which requires only a minimal showing \nof injury.’”)). For instance, even though in Havens Realty Corp. v. Coleman the organizational \nplaintiff HOME’s “activities included the operation of a housing counselling service[] and the \ninvestigation and referral of complaints concerning housing discrimination,” HOME sufficiently \nalleged an injury-in-fact because the defendant’s actions “frustrated . . . [HOME’s] efforts to assist \nequal access to housing through counseling and other referral services,” requiring HOME to make \n“duplicative efforts”31 to “identify and counteract the defendant’s” actions. 455 U.S. at 368, 379; \nsee also Martin v. Kemp, 341 F. Supp. 3d 1326, at 1335 (holding that plaintiffs met their burden \nunder the organizational standing rubric where they had to “divert more resources towards warning \nvoters about the risk of a signature mismatch” when officials reviewed their mail ballots). \nFurthermore, the injury in OCA-Greater Houston is especially similar to the injury suffered \nby Organizational Plaintiffs, particularly in how it relates to OCA’s mission and central initiatives. \nEven though “[o]ne of [OCA’s] primary missions [was] to promote civic participation and provide \ncivic education, which it carrie[d] out through a ‘Get Out the Vote’ initiative,” the Fifth Circuit \nfound it alleged an injury-in fact because, through its educational efforts, OCA had to advise voters \non how to “reduce the chance” of denial of their choice of interpreter due to the existence of the \nTexas law at issue. OCA-Greater Houston, 867 F.3d at 609, 612. Here, although Organizational \nPlaintiffs generally participate in voter registration, education, and outreach, were Defendants to \ncomply with the law, Organizational Plaintiffs would not have to educate and correct DPS \ncustomers who mistakenly think they registered through their online driver’s license transactions.  \n                                                \n31 “In order to compensate for the misinformation it received from Havens, HOME was forced to \nemploy its white staff in duplicative efforts in order to determine whether the information given \nby Havens to HOME’s black staff was accurate and complete.” Br. for Resp’ts at 36, Havens \nRealty Corp., 455 U.S. 363 (1982) (No. 80–988).   \n16 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 64   Filed 03/30/20   Page 17 of 34\n \n \nLikewise, the injury that conferred standing in Fowler is similar to the injury suffered by \nOrganizational Plaintiffs here as it relates to organizational mission and central initiatives. Even \nthough voter registration was one of ACORN’s central initiatives, the Fifth Circuit found that it \nalleged an injury-in fact because it “expended resources registering voters . . . who would have \nalready been registered if the [state] had complied with the requirement under the NVRA that [the \nstate] must make voter registration material available at public aid offices.” 178 F.3d at 361. \nSpecifically, ACORN’s registration drives focused on “registering people at ‘welfare waiting \nrooms, unemployment offices, and on Food Stamp lines’” and ACORN   \nconcentrated [its] voter registration campaign in areas where the percentages of all \nfood stamp participant households registered to vote, a population directly affected \nby one of the NVRA requirements that ACORN claims Louisiana has failed to \nimplement, are among the lowest in Louisiana.  \n \nId. at 360-61. Similarly, Organizational Plaintiffs frequently have to register and will continue to \nhave to register online DPS customers who should have been registered by Defendants pursuant \nto Section 5 of the NVRA; and Organizational Plaintiffs target voter registration activities toward \npopulations with large numbers of people who move frequently or have recently moved, such as \nstudents and people living in localities experiencing growth.32 Although Organizational Plaintiffs \nall generally participate in voter registration, education, and outreach, none would have to register \nonline DPS customers to vote absent Defendants’ unlawful conduct. Id. at 361 (“It is . . . wasted \nresources [counteracting the state’s violation], which ACORN could have put to use registering \nvoters that the NVRA, even properly implemented, would not have reached (or which ACORN \ncould have put toward any other use it wished), that provide ACORN with standing”). \n                                                \n32 See Doc. 5-1 at 165-68; 170-73;175-79; 191-96. \n17 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 64   Filed 03/30/20   Page 18 of 34\n \n \nIf DPS complied with the law, Organizational Plaintiffs could spend the time and resources \nthey  currently  spend  registering,  educating,  and  reaching  out  to  online  DPS  customers  on \nregistering, educating, and reaching out to eligible Texans who are not online DPS customers. \nAccordingly, it is clear that Organizational Plaintiffs sufficiently allege an injury-in-fact as to each \nof their claims.33 \nc.  Plaintiff LWVTX34 has associational standing. \nIn addition to the organizational standing described above, LWVTX also has “associational \nstanding” on behalf of its members who were being harmed by Defendants’ unlawful actions at \nthe time this suite was filed, and who will continue to be harmed.  LWVTX has alleged that \nas a membership organization, [it] has individual members who are harmed by \nDefendants’ violations because they transact with DPS’s online driver’s license \nsystem and are not provided a simultaneous voter registration application, nor a \nsimultaneous update to their voter registration address when they change their \ndriver’s license address through the system.   \n \nCompl., Doc. 1 at ¶ 66. \n \nDefendants are correct that to maintain a cause of action based on associational standing a \nplaintiff association must allege facts to show that: \n(a) its members would otherwise have standing to sue in their own right; (b) the \ninterests it seeks to protect are germane to the organization’s purpose; and (c) \n                                                \n33 In their motion to dismiss, Defendants make a conclusory claim that: “Organizational Plaintiffs \nfail to demonstrate traceability because the alleged harm here . . . is not the result of Defendants’ \nconduct, but rather a result of voters’ failure to follow the process and instructions presented to \nthem as they transact online regarding their driver license.” See Def.s’ Mot. to Dismiss n.2 12-13. \nAs explained above, “[b]ut for Defendants failure to comply with the NVRA [these customers] \nwould already [have been] registered to vote in the county and precinct where they reside.”  Order, \nStringer II, No.: 5:16-cv-00257-OLG, Doc. 156 at 14–15. \n34 Defendants correctly point out that MOVE has not alleged that it is a membership organization \nor that its members are harmed by Defendants’ conduct, see MTD at 14, 15. MOVE does not claim \nto have associational standing. Rather, MOVE’s claims are based on direct injury caused to the \norganization itself, as opposed to any “members,” as described in the sections above.  LWVTX is \nthe only Plaintiff that has associational standing deriving from injury to its individual members.  \n18 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 64   Filed 03/30/20   Page 19 of 34\n \n \nneither the claim asserted nor the relief requested requires the participation of \nindividual members in the lawsuit.  \n \nHunt v. Wash. St. Apple Advert. Comm’n, 432 U.S. 333, 343 (1977).  Defendants contend that \nLWVTX  has  failed  to  plead  sufficient  facts  to  satisfy  the  first  and  third  requirements  for \nassociational standing outlined above.35 See MTD at 13–16. \nFirst, Defendants contend that LWVTX was required to identify a specific member with \nstanding at the time the suit was filed.  However, this proposition—that an association must “name \nnames” to demonstrate associational standing at the pleading stage—was squarely rejected by the \nFifth Circuit in Hancock County Bd. of Supervisors v. Ruhr, where the court considered a similar \nargument: \n[A]ppellees offer no authority for the proposition that an [association] must identify \na particular [association] member at the  pleading stage. We are aware of no \nprecedent holding that an association must set forth the name of a particular \nmember in its complaint in order to survive a Rule 12(b)(1) motion to dismiss based \non a lack of associational standing. \n \n487 F.

Dec. 23, 2019) (order) (holding pleadings sufficient \nfor associational standing where the “organization[] is comprised in significant part by individuals \n                                                \n35 As to the second requirement of associational standing relating to organizational purpose, \nDefendants’ motion states merely that “Defendants do not concede that either Organizational \nPlaintiff has satisfied or can satisfy the second element of associational standing, and reserve all \nrights  to  seek  dismissal  on  that  basis,”  but  Defendants  make  no  argument  about  specific \ndeficiencies  in  Plaintiffs  allegations  that  would  indicate  a  failure  to  plead  facts  relating  to \norganizational purpose, nor do Defendants cite any authority or make any specific argument that \nPlaintiffs’ claims should be dismissed on this basis.  See MTD at 15.  LWVTX has clearly pled \nthat its mission relates to the subject matter of its claims and this is sufficient for purposes of \nassociational standing.  See Ass'n of Am. Physicians & Surgeons, Inc. v. Texas Med. Board, 627 \nF.3d 547, 550 n.2 (5th Cir. 2010) (“[T]he germaneness requirement [for associational standing] is \n‘undemanding’ and requires ‘mere pertinence’ between the litigation at issue and the organization's \npurpose.”). \n19 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 64   Filed 03/30/20   Page 20 of 34\n \n \nwho are likely to be impacted by the relevant policies at issue”).  This standard is not contradicted \nby any authority cited in Defendants’ motion, the majority of which involve determinations on \nstanding after discovery, evidentiary hearings, and/or fact development was completed.  See, e.g., \nNat’l Rifle Ass’n of Am., Inc. v. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, & Explosives, 700 F.3d \n185, 188, 191 (5th Cir. 2012); NAACP v. City of Kyle, 700 F.3d 185, 188, 191 (5th Cir. 2012); \nSummers v. Earth Island Institute, 555 U.S. 488, 491-492 (2009); Tex. Democratic Party v. \nBenkiser, 459 F.3d 582, 585 (5th Cir. 2006).  Only two cases cited by Defendants actually address \nsufficiency of allegations at the pleading stage.  First, in Fund Democracy, LLC v. S.E.C., the court \naffirmed a dismissal because the plaintiff organization did not actually have members at all, so \ncould not possibly name a member with standing at any later stage.  278 F.3d 21, 26 (D.C. Cir. \n2006).  Second, in Draper v. Healey, the court’s ruling was premised on submitted affidavit \nevidence, as well as the plaintiff-association’s failure to plead that an individual member with \nstanding existed at all, not just that the pleading failed to identify that member by name. 827 F.3d \n1, 3 (1st  Cir. 2016).  Neither of these cases  applies  here, where LWVTX  is a  membership \norganization and has specifically alleged the existence of  one or more  members injured by \nDefendants’ conduct and the specific ways they are injured.36 \nAdditionally, LWVTX need not ever identify an individual member with standing if \nidentifiable portions of its membership are necessarily injured by the Defendants’ conduct.  In \nNat’l Rifle Ass’n of Am., Inc., the Fifth Circuit explained that the plaintiff established associational \nstanding simply by showing that specific segments of the organization’s membership would \n                                                \n36 Though not necessary at this stage, and in hearsay form, it is worth noting that LWVTX actually \nhas  identified  an  individual  member  with  standing  as  part  of  the  preliminary  injunction \nproceedings.  See  App’x  to  Plaintiffs’  Reply  at  160-61,  No.  5:16-cv-00257,  Doc.  154-1 \n(Supplemental Declaration of Grace Chimene). \n20 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 64   Filed 03/30/20   Page 21 of 34\n \n \nnecessarily be injured by the defendants’ actions, and the plaintiff was therefore not required to \nidentify any individual members with standing. Nat’l Rifle Ass’n of Am., Inc. v. Bureau of Alcohol, \nTobacco, Firearms, & Explosives, 700 F.3d 185, 191–92 & n.5 (5th Cir. 2012). The Fifth Circuit’s \nholding  is  consistent  with  Supreme  Court  precedent  excusing  associations  from  identifying \nindividual members, but effectively expands the doctrine to cases in which merely identifiable \nsubsets of members are necessarily injured.  Compare Summers v. Earth Island Institute, 555 U.S. \n488, 498–99 (2009) (“This requirement of naming the affected members has . . . been dispensed \nwith . . . where all the members of the organization are affected by the challenged activity.” \n(emphasis in original)), with Nat’l Rifle Ass’n of Am., Inc. 700 F.3d at 191–92 & n.5 (holding the \nNRA had satisfied associational standing requirements because otherwise-unidentified “18-to-20-\nyear-old NRA members have standing to sue in their own right”).  In this case, LWVTX has \nidentified a subset of its members—those that interact with DPS online—that both exist and are \nnecessarily injured by Defendants failure to provide a simultaneous opportunity to submit a voter \nregistration application with their DPS transaction. \nNotwithstanding all of this, the evidence in the record in this case already identifies the \nfollowing:  (1) “With more than 3000 members statewide, LWVTX constantly has members who \nare relocating or need to update their drivers licenses,” and (2) “LWVTX has at least one member \nwho has updated their driver’s license online but was unable to update their voter registration \naddress and remains unregistered to vote at the correct address.” See Pl.s’ Emergency App. for \nPrelim. Inj., Doc. 5, Ex. 23 (Declaration of Grace Chimene).  Unlike the Plaintiffs in Stringer I, \nupon which Defendants’ motion focuses, LWVTX has sufficiently alleged the existence of a \nmember that had interacted with DPS and had not subsequently submitted a voter registration \napplication at the time the suit was filed. \n21 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 64   Filed 03/30/20   Page 22 of 34\n \n \nFinally, Defendants argue that LWVTX has not alleged facts sufficient to meet the third \nrequirement for associational standing—that “neither the claim asserted nor the relief requested \nrequires the participation of individual members in the lawsuit.”  See Hunt, 432 U.S. at 343.   For \nthis contention, Defendants argue that the claims and/or relief requested by LWVTX are not \nsuitable  for  “group  relief”  because  “individual  voter  registrations  are  at  the  heart  of  their \nchallenge.”  However, LWVTX requests declaratory and injunctive relief that subsumes any relief \nthat could be requested by an LWVTX member. A systemic fix to the online driver’s license \nsystem would necessarily prevent all future injuries to LWVTX’s individual members. Nor does \nLWVTX seek money damages for individual injuries caused to individual members that would \nrequire the type of fact development contemplated in Hunt.  The Supreme Court recognized in \nHunt that these were appropriate circumstances for “group relief”:   \nIf in a proper case the association seeks a declaration, injunction, or some other \nform of prospective relief, it can reasonably be supposed that the remedy, if granted, \nwill inure to the benefit of those members of the association actually injured. \nIndeed, in all cases in which we have expressly recognized standing in associations \nto represent their members, the relief sought has been of this kind. \n \nHunt, 432 U.S. at 343; see also Texas Democratic Party v. Benkiser, 459 F.3d 582, 588 (5th Cir. \n2006) (citing Int’l Union v. Brock, 477 U.S. 274, 287–88 (1986)).  Additionally, the questions in \nthis case are primarily legal, about the meaning of the NVRA as it relates to Defendants’ statewide \nprocedures, and therefore do not require direct participation of LWVTX members. Each LWVTX \nmember’s injury derives from the identical conduct of the Defendants and is redressed by  identical \nrelief requested by LWVTX.   \nd.  Organizational Plaintiffs have standing to bring their constitutional claims. \nNext, Defendants’ contend that Organizational Plaintiffs lack standing because their claims \nderive from “third parties.” They are wrong. It is well settled that an organizational plaintiff meets \n22 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 64   Filed 03/30/20   Page 23 of 34\n \n \nall standing requirements so long as the violations by the state injure an organizational plaintiff’s \nvoting-related resources or capabilities and/or an association’s members (who are not considered \n“third parties”). Third party standing, as that phrase is used in Supreme Court precedent, is not \napplicable here, and instead is utilized when a plaintiff brings a claim on behalf of a third person, \nnot, as here, where the plaintiff themselves  have suffered their own cognizable  injury.  See \nKowalski v. Tesmer, 543 U.S. 125, 125–126 (2004). The Supreme Court has long permitted \norganizations to bring civil rights claims if the organization suffers a separate, but concrete injury \nresulting from the violations. See, e.g., Havens Realty Corp. v. Coleman, 455 U.S. 363, 379 (1982) \n(“[C]oncrete and demonstrable injury to the organization’s activities—with the consequent drain \non the organization’s resources—constitutes far more than simply a setback to the organization’s \nabstract social interests.”). And the Fifth Circuit has explicitly rejected the proposition that \nassociations cannot bring claims under civil rights statutes on behalf of their members, recognizing  \nthat  the standard for associational standing outlined in Hunt determines whether “group relief” is \nappropriate. See Church of Scientology v. Cazares, 638 F.2d 1272, 1279–80 (5th Cir. 1981); \nMemphis Am. Fed’n of Teachers v. Board of Educ., 534 F.2d 699 (6th Cir. 1976); 1 Martin A. \nSchwartz, Section 1983 Litigation: Claims and Defenses § 201[C][3] (2020-1 Supp.) (“[I]f an \norganization satisfies the Supreme Court’s test for organizational standing, it should be allowed to \nmaintain suit under § 1983 to redress the rights of its members.”). \nThat use of organizational and associational standing doctrines is the proper analysis is \nevident  in  numerous  voting  rights  cases  finding  organizations  had  standing,  but  nowhere \naddressing the third party doctrine. See Crawford v. Maryland, 553 U.S. 181, 180, n.7 (2008) \n(agreeing  with  appellate  court  that  political  party  had  standing  to  challenge  state  law  on \nconstitutional grounds; no discussion of third party standing); see also ACORN, 178 F.3d at 360-\n23 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 64   Filed 03/30/20   Page 24 of 34\n \n \n61 (organization had standing to assert violations of the NVRA); Harkless v. Brunner, 545 F.3d \n445, 458-59 (6th Cir. 2008) (organization had standing to assert violations of the NVRA, third \nparty standing not mentioned); Browning, 522 F. 3d at 1164-66 (organizations had standing to \nchallenge voter registration procedures; third party standing not mentioned).  \nIII. Plaintiffs have adequately plead their NVRA and Constitutional claims. \na.  Plaintiffs’ state cognizable claims under the NVRA.  \ni.  Renewals \nWithout citing any support whatsoever, Defendants argue that Texas’s online driver’s \nlicense renewal application complies with the NVRA because the NVRA requires that DPS collect \nsignatures on renewal applications, and “the State cannot obtain a written signature in an online \ntransaction[.]” MTD at 18 (emphasis added). Further, the argument goes, because the statute was \nenacted in 1993, Congress likely intended it to require written, not electronic, signatures. Id. at 19. \nThis argument—already rejected by this Court in Stringer I, 320 F. Supp. 3d at 895–98—fails for \nseveral reasons.  \nFirst, the Court need not speculate as to whether Congress envisioned electronic signatures \nwhen it enacted the NVRA because the statute’s unequivocal language reflects Congress’s intent \nthat “each” type of renewal application serve as a simultaneous voter registration application. 52 \nU.S.C. § 20504(a)(1) (“Each State motor vehicle driver’s license application (including any \nrenewal application). . . shall serve as an application for voter registration. . . unless the applicant \nfails to sign the voter registration application.”) (emphasis added); accord Action NC v. Strach, \n216 F. Supp. 3d 597, 622-23 (M.D. N.C. 2016) (holding that the NVRA applies to remote \ntransactions); Georgia State Conference v. Kemp, 841. F. Supp. 2d 1320, 1331-32 (N.D. Ga. 2012) \n(same).  \n24 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 64   Filed 03/30/20   Page 25 of 34\n \n \nTexas cannot evade this clear requirement by selectively choosing to define “signature” in \na way that excludes all online driver’s license transactions from the NVRA’s reach. Instead, Texas \nlaw already recognizes—and Texas already widely uses—electronic signatures in lieu of written \nones. See, e.g., TEX. BUS. & COM. CODE § 322.017 (state agencies may accept electronic records \nand electronic signatures); TEX. BUS. & COM. CODE § 322.007(a), (c), (d) (providing that electronic \nsignatures are enforceable, electronic records satisfy laws requiring them to be “in writing,” and \nelectronic signatures satisfy laws requiring a signature). And, of course, DPS and SOS already use \nelectronic signatures for voter registration, including mail-in driver license renewal forms. TEX. \nELEC. CODE § 20.066(a)(2), (b) (providing that for applicants applying or renewing in person or \nby mail, the electronic signatures collected during their in-person driver’s license transaction are \nused for submitting voter registration, and that DPS provides the electronic signatures to SOS).  \nSecond, to the extent Defendants object to being required to “accept electronic signatures \nrelated to  different documents . .  . in  lieu of  a signature on the [online]  voter-registration \napplication,” Mot. at 19, that is a problem of their own making. As set out above, Texas law allows \nthem to collect and use electronic records and signatures; DPS has simply declined to offer \napplicants a way to enter an electronic signature on its online renewal application. See Screenshots \nfrom Online Application, Exhibit C to Complaint, Doc. No. 1-4. In any event, Defendants already \nuse electronic signatures “related to different documents”—those collected during an applicant’s \nprevious in-person transaction—to register applicants who change their driver’s license address \nby mail, and could therefore do the same for applicants who renew online.37 Their refusal to do so \nfor online transactions is without any legal justification, and violates the NVRA. \n                                                \n37 As set out above, in order to be eligible to use the online application system in the first place, \nthe DPS applicant must have previously completed an in-person driver’s license application and \nprovided an electronic signature for DPS and SOS to use for voter registration.  \n25 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 64   Filed 03/30/20   Page 26 of 34\n \n \nii.  Change of Address \nIncredibly, Defendants claim the NVRA requires DPS to collect a signature for online \nchange-of-address transactions, and that “there is no basis to infer that Congress intended a mere \nchange-of-address form to [function as a voter-registration application] with no signature at all.” \nMot. 19-20. This is plainly wrong, and confuses change-of-address transactions, during which an \nalready-licensed applicant merely notifies the state of her new address, 52 U.S.C. § 20504(d), with \ninitial and renewal applications, where an applicant seeks to apply for or renew her driver’s license. \nId. at § 20504(a)(1).   \nContrary to Defendants’ claim, the NVRA clearly only requires signatures for initial and \nrenewal  driver’s  license  applications,  not  change-of-address  forms.  Id.  at  §§  20504(a)(1), \n(c)(2)(A), (c)(2)(C). “The NVRA’s change of address provision is separate, and does not state that \na signature is necessary for a simultaneous driver’s license-voter registration change of address.” \nStringer I, 320 F. Supp. 3d at 895 (citing 52 U.S.C. § 20504(d)). Instead, the change-of-address \nprovision clearly states that all driver’s license change-of-address forms must also update voter \nregistration information, unless the applicant opts out: \nAny change of address form submitted in accordance with State law for purposes \nof a State motor vehicle driver’s license shall serve as notification of change of \naddress for voter registration . . . unless the registrant states on the form that the \nchange of address is not for voter registration purposes. \n \n52 U.S.C. § 20504(d) (emphasis added).  \n  An applicant using Texas’s official website to change her driver’s license address plainly \ndoes so “in accordance with State law.” And while Defendants claim that subsection (d) does not \npreempt any state law that would require a signature on change-of-address forms, MTD at 20, they \n26 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 64   Filed 03/30/20   Page 27 of 34\n \n \nneglect to mention that there is no state law that contains such a signature requirement for driver’s \nlicense change-of-address forms.38  \n  Finally, Defendants’ claim that it “presents difficulty” for DPS to allow online applicants \nto “state[] on the form that the change of address is not for voter registration purposes” is neither \ntrue nor relevant. MTD at 20. There is no reason DPS could not modify the fields on the online \napplication to allow applicants to simply check a box indicating whether their address change is \nfor voter registration purposes. See, e.g., Exhibit C to Complaint, Doc. No. 1-4 at p. 5 (showing \ncurrent voter registration question asking applicants to select “Yes” or “No” in response to the \nquestion “Do you want to request a voter application?”). Because DPS’s online change-of-address \napplication fails to allow applicants to update their addresses for voter registration purposes, \nDefendants’ motion to dismiss Count II must be denied.  \niii.  Duplicate information and time period requirements \nDefendants argue that to the extent Texas’s online driver’s license renewal and change-of-\naddress application complies with §§ 20504(a) and (d), it  also complies  with the NVRA’s \nprohibition on requiring duplicative information, § 20504(c)(2)(A), and the requirement that \nDefendants transmit voter registration information and ensure eligible applicants are registered in \na specified time period. Id. at §§ 20504(e) and 20507. Mot. at 19-20. They are wrong.  \nFirst, as set out above, the online application does violate §§ 20504(a) and (d). Second, it \ndirects applicants to complete a second form with duplicative information in order to register \nthemselves to vote or update their voter registration, in violation of Section 20504(c)’s plain \nlanguage. Doc. 1 at ¶¶ 9, 44; see also Stringer I, 320 F. Supp. 3d at 892-93. Third, because DPS \n                                                \n38 Of course, if there was such a state law, the NVRA would preempt it. Stringer I, 320 F. Supp. \n3d at 894-95. Further, each of the millions of online driver’s license change-of-address transactions \ncompleted each year would violate it.  \n27 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 64   Filed 03/30/20   Page 28 of 34\n \n \ndoes not provide simultaneous voter registration with its online application, it does not send SOS \nany  voter registration  information  in  connection  with  these  NVRA-covered  transactions,  in \nviolation of its obligation to do so within the time period specified at § 20504(e). Likewise, because \nSOS does not receive this information from DPS, it does not ensure that the online applicants are \ntimely registered as required by § 20507. Accordingly, Defendants’ motion to dismiss Plaintiffs’ \nduplicative-information and time-period allegations should be denied.  \nb.  Plaintiffs’ state a cognizable Constitutional claim. \nDefendants confuse the legal standard required for the Constitutional claim brought in the \ninstant case, first arguing that Plaintiffs must show intentional discrimination in order to prevail \nand then seemingly acknowledging that the Anderson-Burdick test controls. MTD at 21-22. \nDefendants’ argument that Plaintiffs must show intentional discrimination in this case is flat \nwrong. When assessing a challenge to a state restriction on the right to vote, courts use the standard \nprovided in Anderson v. Celebrezze, 460 U.S. 780 (1983) and Burdick v. Takushi, 504 U.S. 428, \n434 (1992). Under the Anderson-Burdick standard, a court  \nmust weigh “the character and  magnitude of the asserted injury to the rights \nprotected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments that the plaintiff seeks to \nvindicate” against “the precise interests put forward by the [s]tate as justifications \nfor the burden imposed by its rule,” taking into consideration “the extent to which \nthose interests make it necessary to burden the plaintiff's rights.”  \n \nBurdick, 504 U.S. at 434 (quoting Anderson, 460 U.S. at 789). \nIn Crawford v. Marion County Election Bd., the Supreme Court explained that, however \nslight of a burden a state restriction on an individual voter may appear, “it must be justified by \nrelevant and legitimate state interests ‘sufficiently weighty to justify the limitation.’” 553 U.S. at \n191 (citing Norman v. Reed, 502 U.S. 279, 288–89 (1992)). A sufficiently weighty justification is \nthe difference between a reasonable and an unreasonable restriction. Crawford at 190 (citing \n28 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 64   Filed 03/30/20   Page 29 of 34\n \n \nBurdick,  504  U.S.  at  434).  Defendants  do  not  provide  any  rational  reason—much  less  a \n“sufficiently weighty” justification—for the burden they impose on the right to vote in Texas. \nTherefore, Defendants’ treatment of online DPS transactions violates the U.S. Constitution.    \ni.  Defendants’ refusal to treat online driver’s license transactions as voter registration \napplications unduly burdens Plaintiffs’ right to vote. \n \nTexas treats some driver’s license applications as applications to register to vote, and also \ndoes not treat other driver’s license applications as applications to register to vote. And it refuses \nto provide a simultaneous voter registration application for people who are similarly situated to in-\nperson or mail-in applicants in every way but one—they completed their transactions online.  \nInstead of using the information applicants already provide to DPS to register them to vote \nor update their voter registration information, Texas burdens applicants who transact with DPS \nonline with a requirement that they retrieve, complete, print, and mail an entirely separate voter \nregistration form in order to register or update their voter registration information. This burden is \nborne exclusively by online applicants; DPS applicants who apply for or change their license \ninformation in person, or change their address by mail, are not required to complete a separate, \nadditional voter registration application in order to register or update their voter registration \ninformation.  \nii.  Defendants’ asserted interest in requiring handwritten signatures is insufficient to \njustify the burdens created by their treatment of online DPS transactions. \n \nDefendants’  justification  for the  burden  imposed on online  DPS  customers  “include \nmaintaining accurate voting rolls and combatting fraud.” MTD at 24. They further state, “Texas \ncan use written signatures in cases of fraud, identity theft, and consideration of absentee ballots.” \nId. But these justifications ignore a fundamental point:  for in-person DPS transactions and mail-\nin change-of-address transactions, the state does not even use handwritten signatures for voter \n29 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 64   Filed 03/30/20   Page 30 of 34\n \n \nregistration or voter verification purposes. See, e.g., Stringer I, 320 F. Supp. 3d at 899 n.54. \nInstead, DPS collects and SOS and counties use the electronic signatures of voters. Id. 899-900. \nThese facts remain uncontested now. Indeed, even though a DPS applicant who indicates he wishes \nto register to vote on a mail-in change-of-address form provides DPS with a handwritten signature \non that mail-in form, the signature DPS sends to SOS for voter registration purposes—and the \nsignature SOS transmits to county election officials for voter registration—is the previously-\nprovided electronic signature collected during the applicant’s most recent in-person transaction.  \nAlthough the state has an interest in verifying voter identity at the polls, this interest has \nnothing  to  do  with  the  handwritten  signatures  collected  by  DPS  during  driver’s  license \ntransactions, since the state only collects and uses electronic signatures on DPS applicants’ voter \nregistration applications. Additionally, under state law, an individual can have any number of \nrelated persons fill out and sign registration applications on their behalf, TEX. ELEC. CODE § \n13.003, undermining the notion that a person’s original hand-written signature can or is used as \nany sort of reliable fraud-prevention measure. This interest is therefore irrelevant and insufficient \nto justify Defendants’ refusal to allow eligible Texans to register to vote during online driver’s \nlicense transactions.  \nDefendants also claim that they treat everyone equally because the signature requirement \napplies to everyone, and that everyone who fails to sign a change-of-address or renewal application \nis not registered to vote.  MTD at 23-24. First, Defendants do not tell the full truth here since, as \nnoted above, the handwritten signature requirement is not applied to in-person DPS customers and \nmail-in change-of-address DPS customers. Second, even if Defendants did treat everyone equally, \nAnderson-Burdick requires them to justify the burden they impose on the right to vote. Burdick, \n30 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 64   Filed 03/30/20   Page 31 of 34\n \n \n504 U.S. at 434 (quoting Anderson, 460 U.S. at 789). Because they cannot do so, their motion to \ndismiss should be denied.  \niii.  DPS’s handwritten signature requirement for online transactions is unreasonable. \n  As pointed out by the Court previously in Stringer I, Defendants have not explained, and \ncannot explain, how the handwritten signature requirement is necessary. 320 F. Supp. 3d at 899-\n900. As the Court observed, because DPS collects electronic signatures during every in-person \ndriver’s license transaction—including applicants’ first applications for a Texas driver’s license—\nDPS already has a signature on file for every person who subsequently renews or changes their \ndriver’s license address. Id. For both driver’s license purposes and voter registration purposes, \nDefendants simply use and store the signature that was electronically captured in the most recent \nprevious in-person DPS transaction. Id. at 899 n.52. Defendants cannot show why handwritten \nsignatures are necessary to confirm voter identity at the polls when collected, stored, and easily-\naccessible electronically-captured signatures do the same thing just as well, if not more efficiently, \nand when Texas already uses these electronic signature for this purpose for in-person and mail-in \nDPS applications. Anderson, 460 U.S. at 806 (quoting Kusper v. Pontikes, 414 U.S. 51, 59 (1973) \n(“If the [s]tate has open to it a less drastic way of satisfying its legitimate interests, it may not \nchoose a legislative scheme that broadly stifles the exercise of fundamental personal liberties.”). \nMoreover, DPS’s online system utilizes a data verification process, which, as Defendants \nhave admitted, requires an online applicant to verify their identity at login, instead of using a \nhandwritten signature. Stringer I, 320 F. Supp. 3d at 878 (“Defendants admit that the personal \ninformation required for authenticating online transactions is equal to or even more rigorous than \nthe identifying information used for in-person and mail-in transactions”).

INTRODUCTION \nDuring discovery, Intervenors Texas Democratic Party (“TDP”), DCCC, and DSCC, \nproperly and more than adequately responded to Defendants’ document requests and questions \nposed to their witnesses in multiple depositions, responding to Defendants’ inquiries related to \nIntervenors’ standing to bring their claims in this case. Intervenors have subsequently responded \nat length to Defendants’ arguments regarding their standing and do not repeat those arguments \nhere. Intervenors submit this sur-reply for the limited purpose of responding to new and improper \nevidentiary arguments set forth by Defendants in their reply brief. ECF No. 92.  \nII.  ARGUMENT \nI.  Defendants’ reply brief is an improper, veiled motion to strike and attempt to file \n  a discovery motion outside of the discovery period.  \n   Defendants repeatedly argue that the Court should not consider the declarations of Jada \nThompson and Alicia Sisneros or the publicly available Federal Election Commission (“FEC”) \nfilings that were attached to Intervenors’ declarations, but Defendants noticeably fail to file a \nmotion to strike that evidence. It is improper to hide a motion to strike in a reply brief, and for \ngood reason: doing so does not afford the opposing party any meaningful chance to respond. See \nStephens v. C.I.T. Grp./Equip. Fin., Inc., 955 F.2d 1023, 1026 (5th Cir. 1992) (holding parties \ncannot raise new issues in a reply brief). Had Defendants filed a motion to strike, Intervenors \nwould have had a fair opportunity to respond, and it would have been clear that there is no basis \nto strike this evidence here.  \n  Defendants’ reply is also an improper attempt to raise objections to Intervenors’ discovery \nmonths after the discovery period has ended. Defendants claim to have outstanding objections to \nIntervenors’ document productions and depositions, but they failed to raise those objections with \nthe Court prior to the end of discovery.  Nor did they move to compel any evidence that they now \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 95   Filed 07/17/20   Page 3 of 10\n \nargue Intervenors improperly withheld on privilege grounds. Discovery motions must be made \nduring the discovery period; as a result, Defendants have now waived any objections they may \nhad. See, e.g., Suzlon Wind Energy Corp. v. Shippers Stevedoring Co., 662 F. Supp. 2d 623, 661 \n(S.D. Tex. 2009) (denying motion to compel deposition because it was filed two weeks after \ndiscovery deadline expired); Days Inn Worldwide, Inc. v. Sonia Invs., 237 F.R.D. 395 (N.D. Tex. \n2006) (in determining whether motion to compel is timely filed, most courts look to discovery \ndeadline, and motion was untimely where filed two weeks after discovery deadline); see also  \nLocal Rule CV-16(d) (“Absent exceptional circumstances, no motions relating to discovery, \nincluding motions under Rules 26(c), 29, and 37, shall be filed after the expiration of the discovery \ndeadline, unless they are filed within 7 days after the discovery deadline and pertain to conduct \noccurring during the final 7 days of discovery.”).  \n  To be clear: Defendants’ objections are meritless. Intervenors more than adequately \nresponded to Defendants’ document requests that explicitly “did not seek all documents” and were \non their face limited to only “the minimum number of documents sufficient” to respond to each \nrequest. See, e.g., ECF No. 85-1 at 40. Intervenors also produced multiple witnesses to sit for \ndepositions and in those depositions responded more than sufficiently to the questions posed by \ndefense counsel. Where Defendants’ counsel attempted to obtain granular and unnecessary details \nabout confidential political strategy and the innerworkings of the Democratic Party, Intervenors \nproperly preserved First Amendment objections to those questions. See, e.g., The Ohio Org. \nCollaborative v. Husted, No. 2:15-CV-01802, 2015 WL 7008530, at *3 (S.D. Ohio Nov. 12, 2015) \n(recognizing the First Amendment privilege protects disclosure of a “wealth of financial, donor, \nmembership, and strategic information” because the “compelled disclosure of such sensitive \ninformation  in  the  context  of  highly  charged  litigation  involving  issues  of  great  political \n2 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 95   Filed 07/17/20   Page 4 of 10\n \ncontroversy would have a chilling effect on plaintiffs' freedom of association by adversely \nimpacting their ability to organize, promote their message(s), and conduct their affairs”); see also \nDemocratic Nat’l Comm. v. Arizona Sec’y of State’s Office, CV-16-01065, PHX-DLR, 2017 WL \n3149914 (D. Ariz. July 25, 2017) (denying motion to compel documents protected by the First \nAmendment privilege). But even then, in almost every case, Intervenors’ counsel instructed the \nwitnesses to answer the question to the degree they could do so without revealing confidential First \nAmendment  information,  and  they  did  so.  Nevertheless,  the  time  for  raising  objections  to \nIntervenors’ discovery responses with this Court has long passed.  \nII.  The evidence submitted by Intervenors is proper and should be considered by the \n  Court.  \n \n  The evidence to which Defendants object was properly filed in response to Defendants’ \ncross-motion  for  summary  judgment,  which  argues  that  Intervenors  lack  standing.  Because \nIntervenors have the burden to prove their standing in response, Intervenors were required to \nprovide the Court with all relevant evidence to aid in its determination at this stage, including \ninformation that supports it that came to light after the close of discovery. Indeed, the Local Rules \nof the Western District of Texas provide that discovery may continue after the discovery cutoff, \n“provided that discovery does not delay other pretrial preparations or the trial setting.” Local Rule \nCV-16(d).  Further,  federal  authority  requires  parties  to  “submit  affidavits  and  comparable \nevidence” in response to a motion for summary judgment. See, e.g., Ass’n of Cmty. Orgs. for \nReform Now v. Fowler, 178 F.3d 350, 357 (5th Cir. 1999) (quoting Cramer v. Skinner, 931 F.2d \n1020, 1025 (5th Cir. 1991) (emphasis added).  \n  Intervenors’ declarations respond directly to Defendants’ arguments that Intervenors’ \nactivities are not undertaken to counteract Defendants’ conduct, and that they lack members. And, \nIntervenors’ declarations are entirely consistent with the evidence. Defendants are wrong when \n3 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 95   Filed 07/17/20   Page 5 of 10\n \nthey say that this is the first time Intervenors have stated they seek to register voters who have \nrecently moved. Mr. Maxey testified to that specific point in his deposition. See ECF No. 77-1 at \n425 (TDP) (“If that were the case in Texas, we would not be spending the time and effort to go \ndoor to door, to table, to mail out voter registration applications to newly -- new arrivals in Texas \nor people who moved in”) (emphasis added); id. at 442-43 (“And so using cutting-edge data, we \ncan figure out approximately 30,000 Democrats move to Texas each month that we need to get \nregistered to vote.”) (emphasis added).  \n  Similarly, Ms. Newman testified during her deposition that she could not quantify the value \nof the staff time spent on registering voters who change their address or renew their driver’s license \nonline with Department of Public Safety because time spent on such voter registration is:  \npart of our ongoing voter education effort to make sure when we’re \ntalking to voters, ‘Are you registered to vote?’ Making sure they are \naware  that  if  they’ve  moved  recently,  depending  on  how  they \nconducted  that  transaction  online  versus  in  person,  that  their \ninformation is treated differently than going in person to change that \nand that they might not, in fact, be registered to vote at their current \naddress. \n \nECF No. 77-1 at 593-94 (DCCC). Ms. Newman’s and Ms. Sisneros’ declarations are entirely \nconsistent with that testimony. They discuss registering voters who have recently moved, and the \ntime spent educating voters as a result of Defendants’ unconstitutional activity. ECF Nos. 90-3 at \n¶¶ 10, 11, 14; 90-4 at ¶ 7. Moreover, all three Intervenors stated in their depositions that they \nconsider Democratic voters to be members and constituents of Intervenor political parties. ECF \nNo. 77-1 at 476 (TDP), 604 (DCCC), 682 (DSCC).    \n  Defendants also mischaracterize Intervenors’ deposition testimony by suggesting that their \ndeclarations  contradict it. In  making  this  argument,  Defendants  offer a  specific example: \nDefendants claim that Mr. Maxey testified that “donations . . . could not be earmarked for specific \n4 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 95   Filed 07/17/20   Page 6 of 10\n \npurposes,” yet have “produced evidence suggesting that this was inaccurate.” ECF No. 92 at \n2 n.2. Though Mr. Maxey did testify to his understanding that a donor cannot legally restrict the \nuse of their donations for specific purposes, ECF No. 77-1 at 437 (TDP), he was clear that if a \ndonation was made, and the donor wished that money would go to a specific program, TDP “can \nthen choose to use it for that program or not.” Id. at 438. That is, donors do not specifically earmark \ntheir contributions for certain purposes, but that does not mean they lack total awareness of how \nfunds are generally used. Thus, when DCCC and DSCC transfer funds to TDP they generally \nunderstood that among the TDP programs that would be supported were voter registration efforts. \nSee, e.g., ECF No. 73-2 at 27:23-28:6 (DCCC). On behalf of TDP, Mr. Maxey has now confirmed \nthat, indeed, some of their funds have been used to support voter registration efforts. ECF No. 90-\n2 at ¶¶ 30-31. There is nothing inconsistent about this evidence.  \n  As for Alicia Sisneros’ declaration, Defendants offered it to provide the Court with \nadditional evidence of the DCCC’s voter registration activities. Since the beginning of Intervenors’ \ninvolvement in this litigation, they have asserted that DCCC paid a consultant nearly $400,000 to \nperform voter registration activities in Texas. ECF No. 41-1 at 8. Ms. Newman, DCCC’s corporate \nrepresentative, testified to that effect during her deposition. ECF No. 77-1 at 577-78 (DCCC). And, \nduring discovery, in addition to the documents produced by DCCC, counsel for Intervenors \nprovided counsel for Defendants with links to the specific entries on DCCC’s Federal Election \nCommission (“FEC”) reports—reports that are publicly available and therefore just as readily \navailable to Defendants as Intervenors—that clearly showed (a) the amounts of the payments made \nby DCCC to Sisneros Strategies, (b) the dates of those payments, and (c) clearly identified Sisneros \nStrategies as the recipient of those payments. Defendants’ request for the Court to ignore publicly \navailable FEC reports should be rejected because these public records are as readily available to \n5 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 95   Filed 07/17/20   Page 7 of 10\n \nDefendants as Intervenors. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b); see also Honeywell Intern. Inc. v. Acer \nAmerica Corp., 655 F. Supp. 2d 650, 656-57 (E.D. Tex. 2009) (granting motion to compel in large \npart because the information sought was not available on public websites).1 \n  As for Jada Thompson, Intervenors were not aware that she had been disenfranchised by \nDefendants’ conduct in 2018 until after the close of discovery. During discovery, Defendants \ndeposed TDP’s corporate witness, Glen Maxey, and asked him whether TDP could identify a \nspecific member “eligible to use the DPS website.” ECF No. 77-1 at 486, 487 (TDP). At the time \nof the deposition, Mr. Maxey could not identify a specific member, other than Plaintiffs in this \ncase, who were eligible to interact with the DPS website or who had interacted with the website, \nthough Mr. Maxey knew that such a member certainly existed. Id. at 109:15-22. On June 22, after \nthe close of discovery, Intervenors learned that Ms. Thompson is a member who had been \ndisenfranchised  by  Defendants’  conduct  in  2018.  See  generally,  ECF  90-1.  Although  Ms. \nThompson was not previously available to be deposed or even available to offer a declaration in \nsupport of Intervenors’ motion for summary judgment, Intervenors have offered it to the Court to \nassure it that Intervenors are aware of members (in addition to the individual Plaintiffs) who have \nbeen disenfranchised due to Defendants’ conduct.2  \n                                                            \n1 Despite the fact that Intervenors disclosed during discovery the dates on which the DCCC paid \nSisneros Strategies for voter registration, clearly showing that DCCC expended funds to Sisneros \nStrategies prior to intervening in this lawsuit, that did not stop Defendants from incorrectly \nasserting that Intervenors had provided no evidence that they expended specific resources on voter \nregistration in Texas prior to joining this lawsuit. See ECF No. 78 at 11 n. 11.  \n \n2 There is case law indicating that Intervenors need not identify a specific member to establish \nassociational standing, especially at the preliminary stages.

INTRODUCTION \n“The right to vote freely for the candidate of one’s choice is of the essence of a democratic \nsociety, and any restrictions on that right strike at the heart of representative government.” \nReynolds v. Sims, 377 U.S. 533, 555 (1964). This Court has already determined that Defendants’ \nrefusal to treat online driver’s license transactions the same as those undertaken in person or by \nmail—where  in-person  and  mail  interactions  offer  the  opportunity  for  simultaneous  voter \nregistration, but online interactions do not—restricts the right to vote in violation of the Equal \nProtection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. See Stringer v. Pablos, \n320 F. Supp. 3d 862, 900-901 (W.D. Tex. 2018) (“Stringer I”). That holding was based on a robust \nfactual  record  wherein  “the  key  facts  of  th[e]  case  [were]  undisputed,”  and  Defendants’ \njustification for the difference in treatment unfounded. Id. at 868. On appeal, the Fifth Circuit \nreversed because it found that the original individual voter plaintiffs lacked standing, but in doing \nso, it expressly did not reach the merits. See Stringer v. Whitley, 942 F.3d 715, 726 (5th Cir. 2019) \n(“Stringer I”).1  \nRather than taking the opportunity to voluntarily correct their unconstitutional conduct, \nDefendants  have  persisted  in  maintaining  this  unlawful  voter  registration  regime,  which \nunjustifiably treats similarly situated voters differently, with resulting injuries to countless Texans’ \nmost fundamental constitutional rights. Intervenors are political party organizations that have both \ndirect organizational and associational standing to proceed with this action, and which sought and \nwere granted leave to participate in this action as Plaintiffs, in order to cure the standing issue. \nNothing has changed regarding the merits of this case since it was previously before the Court on \n                                                           \n1 The individual voter plaintiffs who originally brought this action, and whose injuries were the \nsubject of the Fifth Circuit’s decision are referred to throughout this brief as the “Original \nPlaintiffs.” \n1 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 77   Filed 05/29/20   Page 8 of 29\n \nplaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment in Stringer I, and the relevant facts remain undisputed. \nSpecifically, it is not in dispute that Defendants still do not provide simultaneous updates to voter \nregistration information for voters who update their driver’s license information with the Texas \nDepartment of Public Safety (“DPS”) online. And Defendants’ justifications for their actions also \nremain the same: they continue to erroneously assert that compliance with a handwritten signature \nrequirement under state law justifies their illegal conduct, even though they admittedly still rely \non  electronically  captured  signatures  for  driver’s  license  transactions  and  voter  registration \napplications.2 It also remains true that providing a simultaneous voter registration application to \nonline driver’s license customers would be a simple and cost-effective task for Defendants.  \nWith the standing issue now addressed, Intervenors are entitled to judgment as a matter of \nlaw under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56. Because the Fifth Circuit’s decision did not address \nthe merits of Intervenors’ Equal Protection claim, which were already fully and fairly litigated in \nStringer I, Defendants are barred by the doctrine of collateral estoppel from relitigating the \nquestion of whether their conduct violates equal protection. In the alternative, Intervenors move \nfor summary judgment based on the record before this Court in Stringer I and the record developed \nin this litigation (referred to as Stringer II) thus far. \nII.  FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND \nOn May 10, 2018, following more than two years of litigation, this Court granted summary \njudgment for Plaintiffs, holding that Defendants’ failure to provide simultaneous voter registration \nfor voters who updated their driver’s license information online violated the National Voter \n                                                           \n2 See Defs.’ Supp. Br. in Opp. to Pls.’ & Pl.-Intervenors’ Req. for Prelim. Inj. (“Defs.’ Supp. Br.”), \nECF No. 74 at 11 (arguing Plaintiffs and Intervenors are trying to “force the State to accept online \ntransactions that are not themselves done under the signature of the voter registration applicant”).  \n \n2 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 77   Filed 05/29/20   Page 9 of 29\n \nRegistration Act (“NVRA”) and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. \nStringer I, 320 F. Supp. 3d at 900-901, rev’d and remanded sub nom. Stringer I, 942 F.3d at 715. \nThis Court’s ruling was based on an extensive and robust record, which is incorporated in the 204-\npage appendix filed by Plaintiffs in support of their motion for summary judgment and adopted \nand incorporated herein. See Appx. 1-204, Ex. A. \n  The Fifth Circuit’s reversal of this Court’s order in Stringer I was based entirely on its \nconclusion that the Original Plaintiffs lacked standing; the panel expressly did not reach the merits. \nSee 942 F.3d at 720-23. The Fifth Circuit’s mandate was issued on December 5, 2019, returning \nthe case to this Court. Appx. 268-283, Ex. C. Because Defendants have since refused to bring their \nvoter registration practices into compliance with the requirements of the U.S. Constitution and the \nNVRA, a combination of some Original Plaintiffs and new plaintiffs (“Stringer II Plaintiffs”) \ncommenced this litigation and moved for a preliminary injunction. Intervenors moved to intervene \nin this litigation, and this Court granted their motion on January 21, 2020. See ECF No. 27 \n(granting intervention under both Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(a)(2) and 24(b)). One week later, the Court \ngranted Intervenors’ motion to join Plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction. ECF No. 40. \nThat same day, the Court heard argument on that preliminary injunction motion, and Intervenors \nmoved for leave to file a motion for summary judgment, which Defendants opposed in large part \nbecause they had not yet conducted discovery on Intervenors’ standing. See Defs.’ Resp. in Opp. \nto Intervenors’ Mot. for Leave to File Mot. for Summ. J., ECF No. 50. \n  During the Court’s January 28th hearing on the preliminary injunction motion, Defendants \nadmitted that their conduct has not changed since this Court decided Stringer I, but they again \nconjured up imaginative difficulties and impediments to swiftly bringing their voter registration \nactivities into compliance. Further, Defendants’ counsel repeatedly conceded that none of the \n3 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 77   Filed 05/29/20   Page 10 of 29\n \nmaterial facts have changed, stating: “Your Honor, I don’t think that the facts have changed \nmaterially or relevantly since Stringer One, and I think as [Plaintiffs] laid them out, overall we \ndon’t have an objection to their characterization of the process,” Appx. at 688. Defense counsel \nreiterated this repeatedly. See id. at 741 (“There have been no material changes with our practices \nwith respect to online driver’s license renewal and DPS.”); id. at 742 (“The practices and law \nhasn’t changed.”). \n  Subsequently, at Plaintiffs’ request, the Court ordered the parties to engage in discovery \non a timeline for Defendants to implement a remedy. ECF No. 14. The Court also permitted \nDefendants to conduct discovery on Intervenors’ standing. Id. The expedited discovery period \nended nearly a month ago on April 30. Because there are no material facts in dispute, and \nDefendants have now had the opportunity to take that discovery, Intervenors submit that there is \nno reason to delay consideration of their motion for summary judgment in accordance with Fed. \nR. Civ. P. 56(b). \nIII.  RELEVANT LEGAL STANDARDS \nA.  Summary Judgment Standard \nA court must grant a motion for summary judgment if “the movant shows that there is no \ngenuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.” \nFed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). Once the moving party has met its initial burden of proving that no genuine \nissue of material fact exists, the burden shifts to the opposing party to establish otherwise. \nMatsushita Elec. Indus. Co., Ltd. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 585-86 (1986). To avoid \nsummary judgment, the opposing party must go beyond the pleadings to designate specific facts \nestablishing a genuine issue for trial. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323 (1986). In so \ndoing, the opposing party “must do more than simply show that there is some metaphysical doubt \n4 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 77   Filed 05/29/20   Page 11 of 29\n \nas to the material facts.” Matsushita, 475 U.S. at 586. In other words, “[m]ere allegations of a \nfactual dispute between the parties will not defeat an otherwise proper motion for summary \njudgment.” Pye v. Oil States Energy Servs., LLC, 233 F. Supp. 3d 541, 548 (W.D. Tex. 2017). \nB.  Equal Protection Clause  \nWhen a state election law is challenged on First or Fourteenth Amendment grounds, courts \napply the Anderson-Burdick balancing test. Tex. Indep. Party v. Kirk, 84 F.3d 178, 182 (5th Cir. \n1996). That standard requires the Court to “weigh ‘the character and magnitude of the asserted \ninjury to the rights . . . the plaintiff seeks to vindicate’ against ‘the precise interests put forward by \nthe State as justifications for the burden imposed by its rule,’ taking into consideration ‘the extent \nto which those interests make it necessary to burden the plaintiff’s rights.’” Burdick v. Takushi, \n504 U.S. 428, 434 (1992) (quoting Anderson v. Celebrezze, 460 U.S. 780, 789 (1983)). It is a \n“flexible” sliding scale, where “the rigorousness of [the court’s] inquiry . . . depends upon the \nextent to which [the challenged law] burdens [voting rights].” Id. When a law subjects voting rights \nto a “severe” restriction, it “must be narrowly drawn to advance a state interest of compelling \nimportance.” Norman v. Reed, 502 U.S. 279, 280 (1992). Less severe burdens must be balanced: \n“[h]owever slight” the burden on voting rights “may appear,” “it must be justified by relevant and \nlegitimate state interests ‘sufficiently weighty to justify the limitation.’” Crawford v. Marion Cty. \nElection Bd., 553 U.S. 181, 191 (2008) (controlling op.) (quoting Norman, 502 U.S. at 288-89). \nIV.  ARGUMENT \nIntervenors have standing and are entitled to summary judgment because, by Defendants’ \nown admission,3 just as in Stringer I, there are no real genuine issues of material fact in dispute. \n                                                           \n3 See Jan. 30 Order, ECF No. 46 at 1 (“The facts are uncontested and neither side challenges the \nadmissibility of the preliminary injunction evidence.”); see also Appx. at 688, 741, 742.  \n \n5 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 77   Filed 05/29/20   Page 12 of 29\n \nDefendants still engage in the same illegal conduct for the same illegitimate reasons, in violation \nof equal protection. Stringer I, 320 F. Supp. 3d at 900-901. This time, they are barred by the \ndoctrine of collateral estoppel from arguing otherwise. But even if the Court were to decline to \napply the doctrine of collateral estoppel, Intervenors are entitled for summary judgment based on \nthe Stringer I and Stringer II records, as set forth herein and in the Appendix to the Motion.  \nA.  Intervenors have standing. \nIntervenors have briefed the arguments and authorities in support of their standing multiple \ntimes before this Court. Rather than repeat those arguments again here, Intervenors incorporate by \nreference their briefing in support of their Motion for Preliminary Injunction (ECF Nos. 40, 70, \n76) and in opposition to Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss (ECF No. 71) herein. For the avoidance \nof doubt, however, Intervenors briefly summarize their standing arguments below.   \nIntervenors  satisfy  Article  III’s  requirements  for  both  organizational  standing  and \nassociational standing. Defendants’ previous arguments to the contrary—including their assertions \nregarding statutory standing—have no merit.4 To establish Article III standing, a plaintiff must \nshow (1) an “injury in fact” that is concrete, particularized, and actual or imminent; (2) that the \ninjury is “fairly traceable” to the challenged conduct of the defendant; and (3) that it is likely, not \nmerely speculative, that the injury can be redressed by a favorable decision. Lujan v. Def. of \nWildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560-61 (1992); Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Envtl. Servs., 528 U.S. \n167, 180-81 (2000). It is, of course, axiomatic that “one party with standing is sufficient to satisfy \nArticle III’s case-or-controversy requirement.” Rumsfeld v. Forum for Acad. & Institutional \nRights, Inc., 547 U.S. 47, 52 n.2 (2006); Texas v. United States, 945 F.3d 355, 377–78 (5th Cir. \n                                                           \n4 Defendants argued in  their Motion to Dismiss that  Intervenors lacked statutory standing. \nIntervenors fully addressed that baseless argument in their Opposition to Defendants’ Motion to \nDismiss, ECF No. 71 at 14-15, and do not address it further here.  \n6 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 77   Filed 05/29/20   Page 13 of 29\n \n2019) (quotation and citation omitted). Here, all three Intervenors easily meet this bar. \n1.  Intervenors have direct organizational standing.  \n  First, as the Fifth Circuit recognized in Tex. Democratic Party v. Benkiser, 459 F.3d 582, \n587  &  n.4  (5th  Cir.  2006),  “[v]oluminous  persuasive  authority”  holds  that  political  party \norganizations have standing to challenge state laws that threaten the electoral prospects of their \ncandidates. Intervenors’ missions are to elect Democratic candidates, and one of the ways they \nachieve that is by increasing the number of eligible Democratic voters who are registered to vote, \nparticularly in the upcoming 2020 elections. See Appx. at 447-448 (explaining TDP has a goal of \nregistering the 2.6 million unregistered voters in Texas who are likely to vote Democratic); id. at \n575-76 (DCCC identifies voters who are likely to vote Democratic and seeks to register them to \nincrease the number of voters who “are likely to support Democratic candidates or vote for \nDemocrats”); id. at 677-79 (DSCC anticipates transferring significant sums to TDP to spend on \nfield programs, which will involve voter registration efforts to help elect Democratic candidates \nto national office). Intervenors have standing to challenge Defendants’ continuing illegal conduct, \nwhich makes it exponentially harder for voters who would support them to register to vote, and \nthus directly threatens the electoral prospects of the candidates they support. See Green Party of \nTenn. v. Hargett, 767 F.3d 533, 543-44 (6th Cir. 2014); LaRoque v. Holder, 650 F.3d 777, 786 \n(D.C. Cir. 2011); Smith v. Boyle, 144 F.3d 1060, 1061–63 (7th Cir. 1998); Schulz v. Williams, 44 \nF.3d 48, 53 (2d Cir. 1994); Owen v. Mulligan, 640 F.2d 1130, 1132–33 (9th Cir. 1981); Schiaffo \nv. Helstoski, 492 F.2d 413, 417 (3d Cir. 1974).  \nSecond, Intervenors satisfy Article III because Defendants’ conduct forces them to divert \nresources from their usual activities to lessen the harm caused by their conduct, which causes \ninjury to Intervenors’ missions, as well as their members or constituencies. See, e.g., Havens Realty \nCorp. v. Coleman, 455 U.S. 363, 379 (1982); see also Hunt v. Wash. State Apple Adver. Comm’n, \n7 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 77   Filed 05/29/20   Page 14 of 29\n \n432 U.S. 333, 345 (1977). The Fifth Circuit has made clear that the impact to an organization’s \nactivities or resources does not need to be large to establish standing; even a slight impairment to \nits activities is sufficient to establish standing. See OCA-Greater Houston v. Texas, 867 F.3d 604, \n610-12 (5th Cir. 2017). Furthermore, “an organization suffers an injury in fact when a statute \n‘compel[s]’ it to divert more resources to accomplishing its goals,” and “‘[t]he fact that the added \ncost has not been estimated and may be slight does not affect standing, which requires only a \nminimal showing of injury.’” Fla. State Conference of N.A.A.C.P. v. Browning, 522 F.3d 1153, \n1165 (11th Cir. 2008) (citation omitted). Moreover, the activities undertaken by an organization \nto counteract a challenged state action need not fall outside the scope of the organization’s mission \nor central initiatives to constitute a diversion of resources sufficient to establish standing. See OCA-\nGreater Houston, 867 F.3d at 610 (finding OCA’s primary mission is voter outreach and civic \neducation, and the challenged laws forced OCA to expend more resources on those activities to \neducate voters about Texas’s restrictions on interpretation assistance for English-limited voters). \nHere, the evidence demonstrates that Intervenors have diverted resources in the past to \ncounter Defendants’ unconstitutional actions. And without an injunction, Intervenors will be \nforced to divert more resources in the future. See, e.g., ECF No. 43-1 at ¶ 10-11 (TDP); ECF No. \n43-2 at ¶ 7 (DSCC); ECF No. 43-2 at ¶ 11 (DCCC). Intervenors are spending more money than \never before on voter registration and get-out-the-vote (“GOTV”) efforts in Texas, in order to \ncounteract the difficulties imposed by Defendants’ illegal conduct. See Appx., Exs. G, H, I. TDP, \nfor example, is engaging in the largest voter registration program in the history of the state of \nTexas, with a goal of registering about 2.6 million unregistered, eligible Democratic voters, in \nlarge part because of Defendants’ failure to comply with the NVRA and equal protection. ECF \nNo. 43-1 ¶ 11, Appx. at 351, ¶ 16 (TDP).  \n8 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 77   Filed 05/29/20   Page 15 of 29\n \nIn addition to making it substantially (and unjustifiably) harder for a significant number of \nthese people to be registered to vote, Defendants’ conduct has caused and is likely to continue to \ncause confusion that itself will result in disenfranchisement among Texas voters who have \ninteracted with DPS online. In response, TDP is devoting significant funds and personnel time to \npreemptively mass mail voter registration applications to voters who may have attempted to \nregister online through DPS, Appx. at 436-37, and to educate voters on the confusing pitfalls of \nTexas’s voter registration requirements. TDP’s voter registration program has required more \nresources than it would have if Defendants’ voter registration practices were constitutional. See \nalso id. at 450 (“And most of this we wouldn’t have to do if people could update their registration \nwhen people got their driver’s license updates.”). This is because Defendants’ conduct limits the \neffectiveness of TDP’s registration program, as TDP must try to register more voters than it would \notherwise due to its valid concern that registered individuals will be disenfranchised. ECF No. 28 \n¶ 12.  \n Defendants’ conduct has similarly caused DCCC and DSCC to divert resources from other \nefforts to elect Democrats to the U.S. House of Representatives and U.S. Senate, respectively. Both \ndirectly and through its support of the TDP, DCCC will have to divert resources from its other \nwork to increasing its voter registration and GOTV efforts in Texas. Moreover, DCCC is spending \nmore money in Texas on voter registration and GOTV efforts than it otherwise would. See Appx. \n580 (DCCC stating that Defendants’ violations “will inevitably lead us to have to spend more \nmoney on voter registration and more time making sure we are educating voters, that they know \nthat they might not have been registered to vote or had their address updated if they changed any \ninformation online through the DPS website”). For example, DCCC has already spent nearly \n$400,000 this election cycle to compensate a consultant, Sisneros Strategies, to conduct a robust \n9 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 77   Filed 05/29/20   Page 16 of 29\n \nprogram to register Texas voters. Appx. at 363, ¶ 6; id. at 568-69. DCCC has opened four offices \nin Texas, id. at 514, and hired staff on the ground to both engage with and register voters. Id. at \n568-69. DCCC anticipates ultimately spending millions of dollars to register and mobilize voters \nin Texas in advance of the 2020 elections. ECF No. 43-2 ¶ 6; Appx. at 363, ¶ 7. Neither DCCC \nnor DSCC have unlimited funds, and because both are national party committees, they have had \nto, and will continue to have to, divert resources from other states to voter registration and GOTV \nprograms in Texas because “voter registration’s going to have to be a higher priority than it might \nbe in another state where it’s easier to register folks.” Appx. at 643; id. at 586 (DCCC explaining \nthe importance of voter registration in Texas). DCCC, for example, could have spent the $400,000 \n(or some portion thereof) that it paid for voter registration to Sisneros Strategies on digital voter \npersuasion efforts to protect swing districts within Texas and nationwide. \nIn addition, DCCC and DSCC actively support TDP’s voter registration and GOTV efforts \nthrough financial and staffing resources, ECF No. 43-2 ¶ 9. Through a program called the \n“coordinated campaign,” DCCC and DSCC each plan to transfer a significant amount of funds to \nTDP to support Democratic candidates in Texas in races up and down the Democratic ticket. This \nelection cycle especially, given the difficulties caused by Defendants’ conduct, DCCC and DSCC \nwill transfer funds to the coordinated campaign to help fund TDP’s voter education and voter \nengagement programs on the ground. DCCC has already transferred over $145,000 to TDP for \nvoter registration this election cycle, Appx. at 567, 569 (“We have – with the money that we have \nsent to the Texas Democratic Party, I believe at least two people who have been hired with the \nexpress purpose of assisting voter registration efforts.”). And, DCCC anticipates transferring more, \ngiven its need to help support TDP’s voter registration program to achieve its mission, which, as \nexplained, is substantially more costly because of Defendants’ illegal conduct. Appx. at 363, ¶ 8. \n10 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 77   Filed 05/29/20   Page 17 of 29\n \nIn advance of the 2020 elections, DSCC intends to give significant sums to TDP to spend on its \nfield program, which will necessarily involve, among many things, voter registration efforts, to \nhelp elect Democratic candidates from Texas to national office. Appx. at 657, 665, 677-79. Thus \nfar this election cycle, DSCC has transferred $25,000 to the TDP. Id. at 657. DCCC and DSCC \nsupport TDP’s field programs because they increase the number of registered Democratic voters \nin Texas and the number of voters who support DCCC’s and DSCC’s endorsed candidates. Appx. \nat 565, 586.  \nDCCC and DSCC are injured by Defendants’ conduct in the same way that TDP is injured: \ntheir voter registration and GOTV efforts are rendered ineffective when a voter they convinced to \nshow up to the polls to vote is denied the right to cast a ballot that will be counted because the \nvoter was not registered to vote during their online driver’s license transaction. That voters will be \ndisenfranchised by Defendants’ violation is a certainty at this point; indeed, it already happened \nwith the original plaintiffs in this case. See Stringer I, 942 F.3d at 726 (Ho, J., concurring) (noting \nthat Original Plaintiffs were injured by Defendants’ conduct because “[t]hey were unable to \nexercise their right to vote in past election cycles. And it is a right they will never be able to \nrecover.”) (emphasis in original). The only reason that the parties are not able to identify the precise \nnumber of voters who have indicated they wish to apply to register to vote while transacting with \nDPS online is because DPS (which is the only entity that could potentially identify all of those \nvoters) had not ascertained that number during discovery. ECF. No. 69-1 at 20, 64-65. Intervenors \nmust spend additional funds and allocate more resources to educate and register those who \nmistakenly believe they registered to vote through DPS’s website and are denied the right to vote \nat the polls. They must also persuade additional voters to turn out to vote in order to compensate \nfor voters who are disenfranchised due to Defendants’ conduct. ECF No. 43-3 ¶ 7; Appx. 367, ¶ \n11 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 77   Filed 05/29/20   Page 18 of 29\n \n5; id. at 655-56, 657.  \n These examples of ways in which Intervenors have been forced to divert resources to \ncombat and address Defendants’ actions are more than sufficient to satisfy Article III’s standing \nrequirement for political party entities like Intervenors in a case such as this. See, e.g., Democratic \nNat’l Comm. v. Reagan, 329 F. Supp. 3d 824, 841 (D. Ariz. 2018), aff’d, 904 F.3d 686 (9th Cir. \n2018), reh’g en banc granted, 911 F.3d 942 (9th Cir. 2019),  rev’d on other grounds and remanded, \nDemocratic Nat’l Comm. v. Hobbs, 948 F.3d 989 (9th Cir. 2020) (finding plaintiffs DNC, DSCC, \nand Arizona Democratic Party had direct organizational standing to challenge election laws that \nwill require them “to retool their GOTV strategies and divert more resources to ensure that low-\nefficacy voters are returning their early mail ballots . . . [and] to educate their voters” on those \nlaws); Lee v. Va. State Bd. of Elections, 188 F. Supp. 3d 577, 584 (E.D. Va. 2016), aff’d, 843 F.3d \n592 (4th Cir. 2016) (finding Democratic Party of Virginia “has shown sufficient injury primarily \nin the form of diversion of time, talent, and resources to educate their voters and implement the \nrequirements  of  the  Virginia  voter  identification  law”);  Democratic  Party  of  Ga.,  Inc.  v. \nCrittenden, 347 F. Supp. 3d 1324, 1337 (N.D. Ga. 2018) (holding Democratic Party of Georgia’s \n“diversion of resources from preparation for the upcoming runoff elections to assisting individuals \nimpacted by the handling of absentee and provisional ballots is all the injury needed to meet the \ninjury-in-fact requirement”); Ohio Org.

Husted, 834 F.3d 620 \n(6th Cir. 2016) (holding Ohio Democratic Party had shown injury-in-fact because “the challenged \nprovisions will force [it] to divert resources from ensuring their members and constituents vote to \ncounteracting the negative effects of the challenged provisions.”).  \n \n12 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 77   Filed 05/29/20   Page 19 of 29\n \n2.  Intervenors have associational standing. \n \nIn addition to establishing standing based on injuries sustained by the organizations \nthemselves, Intervenors have standing based on the injuries suffered by their members and \nconstituents. An organization may bring suit on behalf of its members or constituents when: (1) its \nmembers and constituents would otherwise have standing to sue as individuals; (2) the interests at \nstake are germane to the group’s purpose; and (3) neither the claim made nor relief requested \nrequires the participation of individual members or constituents in the suit. Benkiser, 459 F.3d at \n587 (citing Hunt, 432 U.S. at 345). An organization is not required to have a formal membership \nstructure in order to assert standing on behalf of its constituents or supporters. See Hunt, 432 U.S. \nat 345 (holding an organization that possessed the indicia of membership and was responsive to \nthose constituents could assert associational standing); see also Friends for the Earth, Inc. v. \nChevron  Chem.  Co.,  129  F.3d  826,  829  (5th  Cir.  1997)  (finding  nonprofit  environmental \norganization  had  associational  standing  even  though  it  did  not  have  formal  membership \nrequirements). But in any event, Intervenors have sufficiently alleged that they do have members, \nwhom they consider to be Democratic voters and supporters. ECF No. 28 at ¶¶ 11-13; App. at 466, \n594, 672.  \nCourts  have  repeatedly  held  that  political  party  committees  like  Intervenors  have \nassociational standing on behalf of their voter members when they have challenged state laws that \nmake it more difficult for their members to engage in the political process. See, e.g., Crawford v. \nMarion Cty Election Bd., 472 F.3d 949, 951 (7th Cir. 2007) (finding the “Democratic Party also \nhas standing to assert the rights of those of its members who will be prevented from voting by the \nnew [photo ID] law”); Fla. Democratic Party v. Scott, 215 F. Supp. 3d 1250, 1254 (N.D. Fla. \n2016) (holding Florida Democratic Party had standing on behalf of voters “who intend[ed] to \n13 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 77   Filed 05/29/20   Page 20 of 29\n \nregister  as  Democrats  and  who  will  be  barred  from  voting”  given  state’s  closure  of  voter \nregistration).5 Indeed, in a voting case brought recently to address burdens imposed on voters by \nWisconsin state election laws in the context of the current public health crisis, a federal district \ncourt found that both the DNC and the Democratic Party of Wisconsin had standing to sue on \nbehalf of their voter members who would face undue burdens on their right to vote in elections \nheld during the pandemic. Democratic Nat’l Comm. v. Bostelmann, No. 20-CV-249-WMC, 2020 \nWL 1320819, at *3 (W.D. Wis. Mar. 20, 2020).6 \nHere, Intervenors have standing to challenge Defendants’ unconstitutional conduct on \nbehalf of Democratic Texas voters (their members and constituents) who are not able to register \nto vote when they update their addresses or renew their licenses with DPS using its online system, \nincluding at least one of the individual Stringer II Plaintiffs, John Harms, who voted in the March \nDemocratic primary. ECF No. 74-1 35:5-11. Any of these voters could sue in their own right, and \nIntervenors have standing to carry this lawsuit forward to protect their interests. Moreover, \nIntervenors seek systemic changes to the online driver’s license system so that all eligible voters \namong their membership who update their driver’s licenses online will have an opportunity to \nsimultaneously register to vote. Intervenors’ requested declaratory and injunctive relief does not \nrequire  individual  voters  to  participate  in  this  lawsuit.  Benkiser,  459  F.3d  at  588  (finding \n                                                           \n5 See also, e.g., Reagan, 329 F. Supp. 3d at 831; Ga. Republican Party v. Sec. & Exch. Comm’n, \n888 F.3d 1198, 1203 (11th Cir. 2018); Sandusky Cty. Democratic Party v. Blackwell, 387 F.3d \n565, 573-74 (6th Cir. 2004); Bay Cty. Democratic Party v. Land, 347 F.

Supp. 3dat 1254. \n \n6 This standing decision was not disturbed by either the Seventh Circuit or the Supreme Court, \nboth of which issued orders in subsequent emergency appellate proceedings. See Democratic Nat’l \nComm. v. Republican Nat’l Comm., No. 20-1538 (7th Cir. Apr. 3, 2020), Republican Nat’l Comm. \nv. Democratic Nat’l Comm., 140 S.Ct. 1205 (2020). \n14 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 77   Filed 05/29/20   Page 21 of 29\n \nassociational standing on behalf of TDP’s members, proven in part by the type of relief sought, \ni.e. an injunction, which benefits the whole group).  \n3.  Intervenors’ injuries are directly traceable to Defendants’ conduct. \n \nIntervenors easily demonstrate that their injuries are traceable to Defendants. Article III \ndoes not “require a showing of proximate cause or that ‘the defendant’s actions are the very last \nstep in the chain of causation,’” Inclusive Cmtys. Project, Inc. v. Dep’t of Treasury, 946 F.3d 649, \n655  (5th  Cir.  2019).  It  is  satisfied  where  it  is  shown  that  the  defendants’  conduct  has  a \n“determinative or coercive effect upon the action of someone else.” Id. Here, Defendants’ \ncontinued violations have already caused the disenfranchisement of the original plaintiffs in this \naction and are all but certain to cause further disenfranchisement in upcoming elections if \nDefendants are not forced to comply with the law. The disenfranchisement of Intervenors’ \nmembers and constituents, and the diversion of their resources to combat this disenfranchisement \ninjures Intervenors as described above, see supra at 6-14, and satisfies Article III’s requirements.  \n4.  Intervenors’ injuries can be redressed by a favorable decision. \n \nAn injunction that requires Defendants to take affirmative steps to comply with the Equal \nProtection Clause would redress Intervenors’ injuries. “To satisfy redressability, a plaintiff must \nshow that ‘it is likely, as opposed to merely speculative, that the injury will be redressed by a \nfavorable decision,’” and “[t]he relief sought needn’t completely cure the injury . . . it’s enough \nif the desired relief would lessen.” Inclusive Cmtys. Project, 946 F.3d at 655 (citation omitted). \nThis Court need not search far to determine that a favorable ruling would redress Intervenors’ \ninjuries, as the Court’s previous Final Order in this litigation would do precisely that. See Appx. \n285-291, Ex. D. Intervenors have satisfied the standard for redressability under Article III. \n \n15 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 77   Filed 05/29/20   Page 22 of 29\n \nB.  The doctrine of collateral estoppel precludes Defendants from relitigating the \nmerits of this case. \n \nDefendants are precluded from relitigating the equal protection claim under the doctrine of \ncollateral  estoppel,  which  promotes  judicial  economy  by  preventing  “needless  litigation.” \nParklane Hosiery Co., Inc., v. Shore, 439 U.S. 322, 326 (1979). It is ironic that Defendants \ncomplain that Intervenors waste the Court’s time by arguing that the doctrine of collateral estoppel \napplies, see ECF No. 73 at 10, when Defendants have dragged their feet since this litigation \ncommenced. Defendants are not entitled to a second bite at the apple to relitigate issues that have \nalready been thoroughly briefed and examined, and that were not disturbed on appeal. When \ndetermining whether the doctrine of collateral estoppel applies, federal courts analyze whether “(1) \nthe issue under consideration is identical to that litigated in the prior action; (2) the issue was fully \nand vigorously litigated in the prior action; (3) the issue was necessary to support the judgment in \nthe prior case; and (4) there is no special circumstance that would make it unfair to apply the \ndoctrine.” Winters v. Diamond Shamrock Chem. Co., 149 F.3d 387, 391 (5th Cir. 1998). This case \nsatisfies each factor.  \n  First, Intervenors’ Complaint sets forth the exact same equal protection claim that the \nparties have already litigated. Compare ECF No. 28 (Intervenors’ Complaint), with Stringer I, \nAppx. 293-311, Ex. E at ¶¶ 1, 20-21, 59. There can be no doubt that Intervenors satisfied the first \nfactor necessary to apply collateral estoppel.  \n  Second, the equal protection claim was fully and vigorously litigated in the previous action. \nThat Intervenors were not parties in Stringer I makes no difference because collateral estoppel \napplies against Defendants, and Defendants were parties to the prior suit and had a full and fair \nopportunity to defend their actions. Defendants argued then, as they do now, that “state law \nprevent[ed] them from complying with federal law.” Stringer I, 320 F. Supp. 3d at 868. Defendants \n16 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 77   Filed 05/29/20   Page 23 of 29\n \nnever disputed the underlying facts; in fact, they conceded—as they still do—that eligible voters \nwere renewing their licenses and changing their addresses online and that these transactions did \nnot simultaneously accomplish voter registration. See id. at 878 (“This is a very possible thing to \ndo what you’re saying if it was legal, and it’s not legal . . . So I’m not contesting the logistics of it. \nWe can agree that it’s a possible thing to do.”); see also ECF No. 69-1 at 44-45, 53-54 (Secretary \nof State Division Director, stating “what I said is I don’t think it’s going to require a change [to \nthe SOS electronic voter registration database]. . . . And [if a change is necessary,] the cost won’t \nbe very much, and it will only be a one-time cost, but I just don’t know if it’s even going to be \nnecessary”). The Court’s ultimate order in Stringer I turned squarely on whether Texas law \nprevented Defendants from allowing simultaneous registration for online transactions with DPS, \nand after extensive analysis, found that Texas must allow for simultaneous registration for online \ntransactions with DPS. Stringer I, 320 F. Supp. 3d at 900-901.  \n  Third, the issues underlying Intervenors’ equal protection claim were necessary to support \nthe Court’s initial judgment. See, e.g., Winters, 149 F.3d at 392 (finding this factor met when the \nissue “was integrally related to—indeed, it constituted the crux of—the particular judgment”). The \nissue underlying Intervenors’ equal protection claim is whether Texas must allow for simultaneous \nvoter registration when eligible voters complete renewal or change of address applications with \nDPS online. See generally ECF No. 28. It is indisputable that the determination of the issue—that \nis, whether Texas must allow for simultaneous online voter registration—was necessary and \nessential to this Court’s resulting judgment. See Restatement (Second) of Judgments § 27, cmt. j \n(1982) (instructing collateral estoppel should be applied when “the issue was actually recognized \nby the parties as important and by the trier as necessary to the first judgment”).  \n  Finally, there are no other circumstances that would otherwise make it unfair to apply \n17 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 77   Filed 05/29/20   Page 24 of 29\n \ncollateral estoppel. In particular, collateral estoppel applies here despite the Fifth Circuit’s reversal \nin Stringer I because that decision did not address the merits and thus does not control the \nsubstance of the Court’s original judgment. See Langley v. Price, 926 F.3d 145, 167 (5th Cir. 2019) \n(“When a judgment is partially reversed on appeal, ‘[t]here is no preclusion as to the matters \nvacated or reversed.”).  \nC.  Intervenors are entitled to summary judgment for the reasons detailed in \nPlaintiffs’ previous motion for summary judgment.  \n \n  Even if the Court declines to apply the doctrine of collateral estoppel, Intervenors are \nnonetheless entitled to summary judgment for the reasons detailed in Plaintiffs’ Motion for \nSummary Judgment in Stringer I. Intervenors expressly adopt Plaintiffs’ motion for summary \njudgment and appendix in support from Stringer I, which are included in the Appendix to this \nMotion. See Appx. 1-204, 313-344, Exs. A, F.  \n  As previously noted, Defendants had a full and fair opportunity to litigate on that record \nand, perhaps even more importantly, have conceded that the facts have not changed “materially or \nrelevantly since” Stringer I, that Plaintiffs have accurately laid those facts out, and that Texas’s \n“practices” and implementation of the law (as it views it) have not changed. Appx. at 688, 741, \n742. Requiring the parties to go through the charade of putting together again what would \neffectively be the exact same evidentiary record would only serve to waste everyone’s—including \nthe Court’s—time, entirely unnecessarily. Indeed, even Defendants appear to acknowledge as \nmuch. See ECF No. 50 (defense counsel conceding it may be “appropriate to rely upon portions \nof the factual record developed in Stringer I in the interests of judicial and party economy”). \n  Intervenors’ equal protection claim is properly evaluated under the legal test derived from \nAnderson, 460 U.S. 780, and Burdick, 504 U.S. 428. The Anderson-Burdick test requires courts to \nweigh “the character and magnitude” of the alleged burden, against the “precise interests put \n18 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 77   Filed 05/29/20   Page 25 of 29\n \nforward by the State.” Burdick, 504 U.S. at 434. This assessment must “tak[e] into consideration \nthe extent to which those interests make it necessary to burden the [P]laintiffs’ rights.” Id. at 428. \nAny  burden,  however  slight,  “must  be  justified  by  relevant  and  legitimate  state  interests \nsufficiently weighty to justify the limitation.” Stringer I, 320 F. Supp. 3d at 898. \n  Defendants’ conduct fails the Anderson-Burdick test and violates equal protection. Id. at \n899-901. Eligible voters are unduly burdened by Texas’s refusal to allow for simultaneous online \nvoter registration, and these burdens are not outweighed by any state interests. Id. The State’s \npurported interest, described in Defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment, id. at ECF No. 80, \nand response to Plaintiffs’ Motion for Summary Judgment, id. at ECF No. 86, is that the Texas \nElection  Code  requires  a  physical  signature.  Defendants  concede  that  this  remains  their \njustification for not complying with federal law. Appx. at 691 (Defendants argue that “[s]tate law \nrequires that a voter registration application be in writing and signed by the registrant.”). \n  This justification is insufficient to justify the burdens on eligible voters for several reasons. \nAs this Court previously held, “neither federal nor state law limits the signature requirement to \nphysical hand written signatures on paper.” Stringer I, 320 F.Supp.3d at 899. Moreover, “DPS \nalready uses electronic records and previously imaged electronic signatures for every Texan that \nuses the online system for driver’s license renewal or change of address,” and the Secretary of \nState uses those electronic signatures, admitting “it never uses physical, manual, or wet ink \nhandwritten signatures on paper for voter registration purposes.” Id.; see also Appx. at 39, 42, 45-\n46. Defendants’ use of previously imaged electronic signatures for DPS transactions and voter \nregistration purposes has not changed since  Stringer I. See  Appx. at 698 (defense counsel \nexplaining the signature captured during in-person transactions at DPS is “done on an electronic \npad, so an image of that handwritten signature is captured”). Therefore, it remains true that “neither \n19 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 77   Filed 05/29/20   Page 26 of 29\n \nthe law nor the facts support Defendants’ alleged justification for limiting simultaneous voter \napplications to in-person and mail motor voter transactions and refusing simultaneous voter \napplications for motor voters that renew or change their driver’s license online.” Stringer I, 320 F. \nSupp. 3d at 900. \n  The additional discovery taken in this case has made clear that Defendants can take the \nremaining necessary steps to provide a fully simultaneous, non-duplicative voter registration \napplication to voters who update their driver’s license information online in a matter of weeks. See \nStringer II, SA-20-CV-46, ECF No. 69. And, the cost to Defendants to implement this system is \nnegligible or non-existent. ECF No. 69-1 at 44-45, 53-54 (Secretary of State Division Director, \nstating “what I said is I don’t think it’s going to require a change [to the SOS electronic voter \nregistration database]. . . . And [if a change is necessary,] the cost won’t be very much, and it will \nonly be a one-time cost, but I just don’t know if it’s even going to be necessary”). This Court \nshould order Defendants to implement a fully compliant system permanently, so that all future \nTexas motor voters are protected from the disenfranchisement that is presently resulting from \nand—absent this Court’s intervention, will continued to result from—Defendants’ long-standing \nviolations. \nV.  CONCLUSION \n  For the foregoing reasons, Intervenors respectfully ask the Court to grant their Motion for \nSummary Judgment. A slight modification of the Court’s previous injunction would be sufficient \nhere. Plaintiffs have accordingly attached both a proposed final order, Appx. 780-87, Ex. O, as \nwell as a redline comparing their proposal to the Court’s previous order. Appx.771-78, Ex.

EV____ \nDPTY \nCLEW \nPlaint ffs \nCivil No. 5:16-CV-257-OLG \nV. \nROLANDO PABLOS, in his official capacity \nas Texas Secretary of State, and \nSTEVEN C. McCRAW, in his official \ncapacity as Director of the \nTexas Department of Public Safety \nDefendants \nPending before the Court is Defendants' motion to dismiss for lack ofjurisdiction and \nfailure to state a claim (docket no. 7). The Court has considered the motion, Plaintiffs' response \n(docket no. 9) and Defendants' reply (docket no. 12).1 Upon consideration of the arguments \nsubmitted by the parties and the applicable law, the Court concludes that Defendants' motion \nshould be DENIED for the reasons set forth below. \nBackground \nPlaintiffs are four Texas voters who, after moving, completed change-of-address \ntransactions through the Texas Department of Public Safety's (DPS) online Texas Driver License \nRenewal and Change of Address system (the DPS online system). Docket no.  at ¶J 16, 46-50. \n1 \nDuring those transactions, they checked a box to indicate that \"I want to register to vote.\" Docket \nno.  at  36-3 8, 46-49. Thereafter, they believed that their voter registration had been updated. \n1  ¶IJ \nDocket no. 1  at ¶ 50. However, as the DPS online system advises users, checking the box to \n1 Plaintiffs later filed a Notice of Supplemental Authority (docket no. 18), which the Court has \nalso considered. \nof2l \n1 \n\nindicate that \"I want to register to vote\" does not actually register users to vote or update their \nvoter registration. Docket nos. 1  at ¶ 40; 1-2 at 2. Rather, the receipt page that appears when \nusers complete their transaction provides a link that users can follow to a destination page where \nthey can download a physical voter registration form, which they must then print, complete, and \nsubmit either in person or by mail. Docket no.  1 at ¶ 40-42. As a result of their outdated voter \nregistration, Plaintiffs were unable to vote using regular ballots in elections held in 2014, and, in \none Plaintiff's case, 2015. Docket no.  at  46-52. Three Plaintiffs were only able to cast \n1  ¶IJ \nprovisional ballots, and two of them were later notified that their ballots had not been counted. \nDocket no. 1 at ¶J 46, 48, 49. The fourth Plaintiff was permitted to vote only for state-wide \ncandidates. Docket no. 1  at ¶ 47. \nPlaintiffs claim that Defendants' administration of voter registration through the DPS \nonline system violates National Voter Registration Act (NVRA) \"motor voter\" provisions that \nrequire \"[s]imultaneous application for voter registration and application for motor vehicle \ndriver's license[.]\" 52 U.S.C.  20504 (2012); Docket no.  at  59, 62-67, 70-74. Plaintiffs also \n§  1  ¶IJ \nraise a claim under the Equal Protection clause. Docket no. 1  at ¶J 5 8-59. In their motion \nseeking dismissal of Plaintiffs' claims, Defendants argue that Plaintiffs lack standing because \ntheir improper voter registration was caused by their own failure to complete and submit physical \nvoter registration forms after completing their transactions through the DPS online system; \nbecause they have not pleaded that they remain unregistered to vote at their new addresses; and \nbecause Plaintiffs have not provided the required pre-suit notice of their claims. Docket no. 7 at \n7-13. Defendants also argue that Plaintiffs have failed to state claims because they acknowledge \nnot having submitted signed voter registration applications with their updated addresses; the \n2 of2l \n\nNVRA does not require states to provide online voter registration; and because Plaintiffs have \nnot identified similarly situated individuals who were treated differently than them. \nLegal Standards and Analysis \nA.  Standing \nWhen a court lacks statutory or constitutional power to hear a case, including for reasons \nof mootness or lack of standing, a party may move for dismissal under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1) \nfor lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. Hooks v. Landmark Indus., Inc., 797 F.3d 309, 312 (5th \nCir. 2015). A plaintifr s failure to show their standing, the case's ripeness, and the court's subject \nmatter jurisdiction may be established by the complaint alone, the complaint supplemented by \nundisputed facts, or the complaint supplemented by undisputed facts plus the court's resolution \nof disputed facts. Robinson v.  TCl/US W.  Commc'ns Inc., 117 F.3d 900, 904 (5th Cir. 1997); \nRamming v.  United States, 281 F.3d 158, 161  (5th Cir. 2001). To establish Article III standing, a \nplaintiff must show an \"injury in fact4' that is concrete, particularized, and actual or imminent; \nthat the injury in fact is \"fairly traceable\" to the challenged conduct of the defendant; and that it \nis likely, not merely speculative, that the injury can be redressed by a favorable decision. Friends \nof the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Envtl. Servs. ('TOG), Inc., 528 U.S. 167, 181 (2000). \nDefendants argue that Plaintiffs have failed to establish the causation element necessary \nfor Article III standing because Plaintiffs' injury stemmed from their own failure to print, \ncomplete, and submit physical voter registration forms as instructed during their online \ntransactions. Defendants rely upon the holding of the Fifth Circuit in Westfall v. Miller. In that \ncase, the court found a lack of standing where the plaintiff's \"inaction has caused any injury he \nhas suffered\" because he sued over a requirement that he obtain law enforcement certification \nbefore being permitted to purchase a machine gun after unsuccessfully seeking the certification \nof2l \n3 \n\nfrom only some of the officials who could provide it. 77 F.3d 868, 871 (5th Cir. 1996). However, \nWestfall is distinguishable. In that case, the plaintiff failed to follow the statutory procedure for \nobtaining the law enforcement certification, and then sought a writ of mandamus, and brought a \nclaim under the Administrative Procedures Act, seeking a court order that the Bureau of Alcohol, \nTobacco and Firearms approve his application anyway. The court concluded that, as to his non- \nconstitutional claims, plaintiff lacked standing because he sought a court order dictating the \noutcome of a statutory process that he had not completed. Westfall, 77 F.3d at 872. Westfall did \nalso raise constitutional challenges to the validity of the law enforcement certification \nrequirement, but the court found separately that those claims failed \"because the law \nenforcement certification requirement did not violate the Constitution.\" Westfall, 77 F.3d at 870. \nIn this case, Plaintiffs challenge the validity of the state's registration process, and the Court \nfinds no basis to dismiss that challenge. Defendants' argument that Plaintiffs are responsible for \ntheir own injury because they failed to complete the state's registration process overlooks the \ntwo-fold nature of Plaintiffs' claimed injury. Plaintiffs contend that state's registration process is \nitself unlawful, and thus allege not only disenfranchisement, but also a violation of their statutory \nright to \"[s]imultaneous application for voter registration and  driver's license[.]\" 52 U.S.C. \n. .  .  § \n20504. This statutory injury remains cognizable regardless of whether Plaintiffs completed the \nvoter registration process that they challenge.2 \n2 Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins, 136 S. Ct. 1540, 1549 (2016), as revised (May 24, 2016) \n(\"Congress has the power to define injuries and articulate chains of causation that will give rise \nto a case or controversy where none existed before.\"); Wendt v.  24 Hour Fitness USA, Inc., No. \n15-10309, 2016 WL 1458989, at *2 (5th Cir. Apr. 13, 2016) (\"[t]he actual or threatened injury \nrequired by Art. III may exist solely by virtue of 'statutes creating legal rights, the invasion of \nwhich creates standing.\"); Ass 'n of Cmty.  Organizations for Reform Now v. Fowler, 178 F.3d \n350, 363 (5th Cir. 1999) (the NVRA's private right of action \"extend[s] standing under the Act \nto the maximum allowable under the Constitution\"); Arcia v. Florida Sec 'y of State, 772 F.3d \n1335, 1341 (11th Cir. 2014) (\"Even though they were ultimately not prevented from voting, an \n4 of 21 \n\nDefendants also argue that Plaintiffs' injuries are not redressable and their claims are \nmoot because they were disenfranchised only in past elections and their voter registration was \ncorrected using the provisional ballots that they submitted. Defendants argue that the \"capable- \nof-repetition\" exception to mootness does not apply because there is not a reasonable expectation \nthat Plaintiffs will be disenfranchised in this manner in the future. Docket no. 7 at 11 (citing \nSpencer v. Kemna, 523 U.S. 1, 17-18 (1998) (capable of repetition yet evading review exception \nto mootness applies where \"(1) the challenged action [is] in its duration too short to be fully \nlitigated prior to cessation or expiration, and (2) there [is] a reasonable expectation that the same \ncomplaining party [will] be subject to the same action again.\")). \nHowever, voting-related lawsuits do not become moot merely because an election has \npassed. Freedom v.  Carmouche, 449 F.3d 655, 662 (5th Cir. 2006) (\"Controversy surrounding \nelection laws.  is one of the paradigmatic circumstances in which the Supreme Court has found \n. . \nthat full litigation can never be completed before the precise controversy (a particular election) \nhas run its course.\"). Furthermore, the likelihood of recurring injury is not strictly limited to \nwhether these particular plaintiffs will likely suffer the same injury again, but may be assessed in \nterms of \"other individuals [who] will be affected by the continuing existence\" of the challenged \npractice. Carmouche, 449 F.3d at 662. Since Plaintiffs' injuries consist of both NYRA violations \nand the disenfranchisement that followed, their injuries are capable of redress by the injunctive \nrelief they seekregardless of whether they had actually been prevented from voting or whether, \nabsent this relief, they would be disenfranchised in the future. Charles H Wesley Educ. Found., \nInc. v.  Cox, 408 F.3d 1349, 1352 n.3, 1354 (11th Cir. 2005) (injunctive relief to correct an \ninjury like theirs [being erroneously identified as a non-citizen and removed from the voter rolls] \nis sufficient to confer standing.\"); Common Cause/Georgia v. Billups, 554 F.3d 1340, 1351 (11th \nCir. 2009) (\"A plaintiff need not have the franchise wholly denied to suffer injury.\"). \nof2l \n5 \n\nunlawful practice is an appropriate remedy for injury caused by NVRA violation); Arcia v. \nFlorida Sec'y of State, 772 F.3d 1335, 1341 (11th Cir. 2014). Other individuals will certainly be \naffected by the practices that Plaintiffs challenge in this case. Storer v. Brown, 415 U.S. 724, 737 \n(1974) (jost-election challenge to state law regarding candidate eligibility was not moot because \nchallenged law's \"effects on independent candidacies[] will persist as [they] are applied in future \nelections.\"). Indeed, Plaintiffs have produced evidence that thousands of Texans submitted \ncomplaints to the state that related in some way to DPS  processing of voter registration \n'S \ninformation through its website. Docket nos.  at  9, 55;  1-3 at 1-108. For these reasons, the \n1  ¶IJ \nCourt need not resort to speculation about the possibility that some of the named Plaintiffs might \nmove and again seek to update their voter registration through the DPS online system. Rather, on \nthe record presented, the Court can conclude that Plaintiffs have articulated an injury that is \ncapable of redress by the Court. The passing of an election and subsequent update(s) of \nPlaintiffs' voter registration based on their provisional ballots does not change the nature of this \ncontroversy as one which \"is capable of repetition, yet evading review.\"  United States v. \nLouisiana, 196 F. Supp. 3d 612, 663 (M.D. La. 2016). \nDefendants also argue that the Court should limit its jurisdiction in this case to reviewing \nonline changes of address, rather than online driver's license renewal, because \"Plaintiffs have \nonly alleged that they sought to change their addresses online, not that they sought to renew their \ndriver licenses online.\" Docket nos. 7 at 15 n.9; 12 at 5-6. The Court does not agree. Defendants \nacknowledge that each Plaintiff alleges that they sought to, respectively, \"update[]\" or \n\"change[]\" their driver license address online, and that following that transaction, they \"received \nan updated driver's license in the mail.\" Docket no.  1  at ¶J 46-50. The record indicates that \nPlaintiffs did so through the single online system\"the Texas Driver License Renewal and \nof2l \n6 \n\nChange of Address system\"that Defendants use to process both driver license renewals and \nchanges of address. Docket nos.  1-2 at 1; 9 at 3. Plaintiffs allege that that system fails to comply \nwith the \"[s]imultaneous application for voter registration and  driver's license\" requirement \n. .  . \nof 52 U.S.C.  20504. Defendants do not contend that Plaintiffs would have encountered a \n§ \ndifferent result if their change of address transactions happened to coincide with the expiration of \ntheir driver's license. If they had coincided, Plaintiffs' injuries would be no less concrete, \nparticularized, or traceable to that system's inadequacy. This confounds the distinction that \nDefendants now seek to draw between driver license renewal transactions and change of address \ntransactions. Regardless of how the transaction is characterized, a user of Defendants' system \nwho selected the \"I want to register to vote\" box but did not complete and submit a separate \nvoter registration application could claim a violation of their right to \"[s]imultaneous application \nfor voter registration and  ..  driver's license\" under 52 U.S.C.  20504. Assuming any previous \n.  § \nregistration not corrected by the next election, such an individual would also suffer \ndisenfranchisement that would be fairly traceable to the alleged inadequacy of the DPS online \nsystem. \nFor these reasons, the Court rejects Defendants' standing arguments. \nB.  The NVRA's notice requirement \nDefendants argue Plaintiffs did not comply with the NVRA's pre-suit notice requirement. \nThe private right of action that Congress established for enforcement of the NVRA provides that \nplaintiffs who claim NVRA violations may sue only if the violations were not corrected ninety \ndays after they provided notice of those violations. 52 U.S.C. § 20510 (2012); Scott v. Schedler, \n771 F.3d 831, 835-36 (5th Cir. 2014). On June 23, 2015, Defendants acknowledged receipt of a \nletter, dated May 27, 2015, that detailed claims of the state's NVRA violations. Docket no. 1-4 at \nof2l \n7 \n\n2-17, 22. That letter was sent on behalf of a group of eleven Texas voters that included two of \nthe four Plaintiffs in this case, and described several claimed NVRA violations, including the \nclaims at issue in this case. The parties thereafter exchanged substantial correspondence and \nresolved many of the NVRA deficiencies alleged in that letter, though not the claims raised here \nabout the DPS online system. See, e.g., docket no. 1-4 at 40-46, 49-50. In that correspondence, \nDefendants confirmed that six of the eleven voters named in the May 27 letter were registered at \ntheir correct address, but could not confirm the voter registrations of the remaining individuals \nbecause they did not provide their addresses. Docket no. 1-4 at 45. Thereafter, on October 23 and \nNovember 18, 2015, Plaintiffs' counsel sent supplemental letters providing notice of the claims \nraised by the two remaining named Plaintiffs. Docket no. 1-4 at 17 1-72, 195-96. Plaintiffs \nfollowed these letters with a \"renewed request to negotiate\" on November 30, 2015. Docket no. \n1-4 at 197-201. Defendants do not dispute the sufficiency of the notice that Plaintiffs provided \nmore than ninety days before bringing their claims. Rather, Defendants argue that they have done \nall they can do to resolve Plaintiffs claims because they verified the registration status of some \npotential plaintiffs, and because, to the extent that Plaintiffs suffer a continuing injury, they have \nnot been provided an opportunity to attempt compliance. Docket no. 7 at 12. The record shows, \nhowever, that Plaintiffs notified Defendants of their belief that the DPS online system violated \nthe NYRA, the parties discussed this matter extensively, and came to a disagreement about what \nthe NYRA requires. By June 23, 2015, Defendants had reviewed Plaintiffs' contentions and \nflatly refused to take the steps that Plaintiffs contend are required by the NVRA. Docket no.  1-4 \nat 25-27, 45-46. Thus, with the passage of ninety days, this established a conflict about the \nmeaning of the NYRA that is not barred by Section 205 10(b)(2). \nof2l \n8 \n\nDefendants rely upon Georgia State Conference 0fNAACP. v. Kemp to argue that the \nNVRA's notice provision bars Plaintiffs from proceeding with their claims because Defendants \n\"attempted to comply with\" the relevant provisions of the NVRA. 841 F. Supp. 2d 1320, 1335 \n(N.D. Ga. 2012). In that case, however, the plaintiff in question claimed that he had not been \nprovided with a voter registration application as required by the NVRA, but the defendants in \nthat case did not learn of this claim until service of the complaint. At that point, they provided \nthat plaintiff's counsel with the voter registration application, a step that the court found to be \n\"exactly th[e] sort of compliance attempt\" that is required by the NVRA. Kemp, 841 F. Supp. 2d \nat 1324, 1336.  In this case, more than ninety days before the complaint was filed and after an \nextensive, prolonged, and fruitful compliance attempt, the parties identified a remaining \"central \nissue still in dispute\" as Defendants flatly refused to take steps that Plaintiffs insist are required \nby the NVRA. Docket no. 1-4 at 45-46. The notice requirements of the NVRA are intended to \nencourage parties to pursue pre-litigation resolution of their NVRA disputes, but they do not \nimmunize a defendant from suit merely because the defendant claims to have attempted some \ncompliance. Nor does Section 20510 or Kemp create a categorical rule that a defendant may \nextinguish any NVRA claim simply by sending a voter registration form. \nFor these reasons, the Court rejects Defendants' NVRA notice arguments. \nC.  Failure to State a Claim: The NVRA \nAs an initial matter, Defendants argue that Plaintiffs' claims should be dismissed because \n\"all of them indicated through the online interface that his or her change of address was not for \nThe Fifth Circuit's opinion in Scott v. Schedler, which discusses Kemp, is also \ndistinguishable. In that case, the appeals court rejected an individual plaintiff's argument that he \ndid not need to individually comply with the NVRA notice requirement because an \norganizational plaintiff had already provided notice of the type of NVRA violations alleged. 771 \nF.3d 831, 836 (5th Cir. 2014) (individual plaintiff \"cannot piggyback on the [organizational \nplaintiff's] notice for several reasons\"). \n9 of2l \n\nvoter registration purposes.\" Docket no. 7 at 15. Defendants argue that \"Plaintiffs would.  have \n. . \nstates treat all 'driver's license change-of-address transactions as updates for voter registration \npurposes,' even where the application 'states on the form that the change of address is not for \nvoter registration purposes.\" Docket no. 7 at 15-16. It is true that, for reasons Plaintiffs have not \nexplained, exhibit 2 of their Complaint, a screenshot of step 5 of the DPS online system, depicts \na selection not to register to vote. Docket no.  1-2 at 2. Nonetheless, the complaint incorporates \nallegations contained within the notices provided to Defendants that each Plaintiff, in addition to \n\"chang[ing]  [their] address\" through DPS's website, also \"attempted to update [their] voter \nregistration online through DPS' website.\" Docket nos. 1  at ¶ 33; 1-4 at 14, 171, 195; see also \nTellabs, Inc. v.  Makor Issues & Rights, Ltd., 551 U.S. 308, 322 (2007) (review of 12(b)(6) \nmotion \"must consider.  documents incorporated into the complaint by reference\"). Plaintiffs' \n.  . \nsubsequent arguments against Defendants' motion to dismiss further clarify that that they do \ncontend that the online change-of-address forms that they submitted to DPS \"indicat[ed] 'Yes. \nI want to register to vote.\" Docket no. 9 at 12. Therefore, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have \nsufficiently alleged that their online submissions to DPS indicated their desire to update their \nvoter registration information. \nNext, Defendants dispute Plaintiffs' claim that the NVRA requires that voter registration \nbe \"simultaneous\" with submission of a driver license application, renewal application, or \nchange of address form. Docket nos. 7 at 15; 12 at 7 & n.5. Defendants argue that the NVRA \nmerely requires states to establish \"procedures to register to vote.  by application made \n.  . \nsimultaneously\" with a driver license application, and expressly permits voter registration to be \nnon-simultaneous with the driver license application by allowing the state motor vehicle \nauthority up to 10 days to transmit the voter registration information to the appropriate state \nof2l \n10 \n\nelection official. 52 U.S.C.  20503(a)(1) and 20504(e)(1) (2012). Therefore, Defendants argue, \n§ \nthe NVRA merely requires that states provide \"a simultaneous opportunity to apply to register to \nvote\" when a prospective voter submits an NVRA-covered driver's license transaction. Docket \nno. 12 at 8. This argument blurs a crucial distinction: the NVRA does not require that the voter's \nactual registration be effected simultaneously with their NVRA-covered driver's license \ntransaction, but does require that their application for voter registration be made simultaneous \nwith that transaction. Section 20504captioned \"[s]imultaneous application for voter \nregistration and application for motor vehicle driver's license\"not only requires that the \napplications be simultaneous, but discusses them in terms of a single transaction. See, e.g., 52 \nU.S.C.  20504(a)(1) (each driver's license application \"shall serve as an application for voter \n§ \nregistration\"), (c)( 1) (\"Each State shall include a voter registration application form for elections \nfor Federal office as part of an application for a State motor vehicle driver's license\"), (d) \n(change of address form \"shall serve as notification of change of address for voter registration\") \nA similar construction is used in the NVRA provision that specifically discusses change of \naddress forms, requiring that a change of address form submitted \"in accordance with State law \nfor purposes of a State motor vehicle driver's license\" also serve as a change of address for voter \nregistration purposes. 52 U.S.C.  20504(d). It is only after the simultaneous application is \n§ \naccepted that the state motor vehicle authority may take up to 10 days to transmit the voter \nregistration portion of that application to the appropriate state election official. 52 U.S.C. \n§ \n20503(e)(1). \nDefendants also argue that requiring submission of a mail or in-person application for \nvoter registration in addition to an online DPS transaction does not violate the NVRA' s limits on \nduplicative information requirements. Docket no. 12 at 7 n.5. Again, the language of the NVRA \nof2l \n11 \n\nindicates otherwise. The NVRA limits the voter registration portion of the application to \"the \nminimum amount of information necessary\" to prevent duplicative voter registrations and allow \nstate election officials to assess voter eligibility and administer the voter's registrationand it \nspecifically provides that the voter registration portion \"may not require any information that \nduplicates information required in the driver's license portion of the form[.]\" 52 U.S.C. \n§ \n205 04(c)(2). The record in this case shows that nearly all of the information required by the voter \nregistration application that Defendants direct users to complete after they have completed their \nonline transaction is duplicative of information they provided during that online transaction. \nDocket nos. 1-5 at 25-26; 7 at 4. Indeed, it is the same form that prospective voters would use if \nthey had not submitted an online change-of-address form at all, and merely applied to the \nSecretary of State for voter registration in person or by mail in the first instance. But cf 52 \nU.S.C.  20504 (a)(l) and (c)(l) (state shall include voter registration form \"as part of an \n§ \napplication for a State motor vehicle driver's license\"; \"driver's license application\" \"include[es] \nany renewal application\") \nDefendants' central argument, however, is that Plaintiffs have failed to state an NVRA \nclaim because imposing a signature requirement, and declining to update voter information based \non online submissions absent a separate, signed application, is within the discretion afforded by \nthe Federal Constitution's Elections Clause4 and NVRA language that Defendants argue \nincorporates requirements of state law into the NVRA's requirements for effective voter \nregistration applications. Docket no. 12 at 2 (quoting 52 U.S.C.  20504(a)(1) and (d) that the \n§ \nU.S. Const. art. I, § 4, ci. 1; see also Arizona v. Inter Tribal Council ofArizona, Inc., \n133 5. Ct. 2247, 2253 (2013) (\"The Clause's substantive scope is broad. Times, Places, and \nManner,.  are comprehensive words, which embrace authority to provide a complete code for \n.  . \ncongressional elections, including.  regulations relating to registration.\") (internal quotation \n.  . \nmarks omitted). \nof2l \n12 \n\nNVRA applies to transactions completed \"in accordance with State law\"). Under Texas law, a \nprospective voter's signature is captured when the voter completes their voter registration \napplication. Tex. Elec. Code Ann.  20.066 (West 2010). That initial signature is entered into \n§ \nDPS's electronic data system and transmitted to the Secretary of State, and is used to verify the \nvoter's identity when they appear to vote by comparing it to a signature that the voter provides at \ntheir polling place. Id.; Tex. Elec. Code Ann.  63.002 (West 2010 & 2015 Supp.);  Tex. \n§  1 \nAdmin. Code Ann.  81.58 (West); Crawford  Marion Cly. Election Bd., 553 U.S. 181, 197 \n§  V. \n(2008); Docket nos. 7 at 14-15; 9 at 21-22. The state statute that sets forth the change of address \nprocedure for voter registration does not include an explicit signature requirement, but only \npermits submissions to be made in person or by mail in most circumstances. Tex. Elec. Code \nAnn.  20.063(c) (West 2010). However, \"registered voters who move within a single county \n§ \nmay change their addresses online and, in so doing, automatically update their voter registration \naddress\" but they \"must re-register to vote if they move to a new county.\" Docket no.  1-4 at 25; \nsee also Tex. Elec. Code Ann.  15.021(d) (West 2010) (\"A voter who continues to reside in the \n§ \ncounty in which the voter is registered may correct information under this section by digital \ntransmission of the information\"). \nIn Arizona v. Inter Tribal Council ofArizona, Inc., the Supreme Court considered the \nvalidity of a state voter registration scheme that sought to safeguard the integrity of the voting \nprocess by use of a mechanism that conflicted with the NVRA's registration requirements. See \n133 S. Ct. 2247 (2013). In that case, the Court reviewed an Arizona statute that prohibited county \nrecorders from accepting any voter registration application submitted by mail and not \naccompanied by documentation of the applicant's citizenship, where the NVRA requires states to \naccept and use a mail application registration form that requires only an attestation of citizenship. \nof2l \n13 \n\nInter Tribal Council of Arizona, Inc., 133 S. Ct. at 2252, 2254 (comparing Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. \n16-166(F) with NVRA provision now codified at 52 U.S.C.  20505(a)(l) (2012)). In that case, \n§  § \nthe Court engaged in a textual analysis and found that the limitations imposed by the Arizona \nstatute were incompatible with, and thus preempted by, the NVRA requirements with respect to \nmail-in registration applications. Inter Tribal Council ofArizona, Inc., 133 S. Ct. at 2254-56. \nSimilarly, in this case, assuming the truth of Plaintiff's allegations, the Court finds that \nDefendants' procedures of refusing to update voter registration information based on online \nchange-of-address submissions is inconsistent with the plain language of the NVRA. The NVRA \nrequires that driver's license applications, renewal applications, and change of address forms that \nare submitted in accordance with state law \"shall serve\" as applications for voter registration or \nnotifications of change of address for purposes of voter registration. 52 U.S.C.  20504(a)(1) and \n§ \n(d). Defendants' policies have established one category of NVRA-covered driver's license \ntransactions--online change of address and driver's license renewal submissionsthat do not \nalso serve as applications for or updates to voter registration. Defendants' policies require users \nwho complete these online transactions and wish to update their voter registration to complete a \nsecond transaction that is almost completely duplicative of the first, just as if they had submitted \nno online change of address form at all. This violates the NVRA's requirements that voter \nregistration applications be integrated into driver's license renewal applications, 52 U.S.C. \n§ \n20504(c)(1), that driver's license renewal and change of address forms have equal effect as voter \nregistration change of address forms,  at (a)( 1) and (d), and that the voter registration portions \nid. \nof the form not require information that duplicates the driver's license portion,  at (c)(2). \nid. \nThe Court is not persuaded by Defendants' argument that the NVRA conditions its \napplication on a prospective voter's compliance with state law in completing voter registration \n14 of 21 \n\ntransactions. Docket no. 12 at 8 n.6. This circular and self-defeating reading of the NVRA is \ncontrary to the statutory text, which imposes the \"in accordance with state law\" requirement not \nupon voter registration transactions, but upon the driver's license transactions with which they \nmust be simultaneous. 52 U.S.C.  20504(a)(1) (simultaneous application requirement applies to \n§ \ndriver's license applications and renewal applications \"submitted to the appropriate State motor \nvehicle authority under State law\"); (d) (\"[amy change of address form submitted in accordance \nwith State law for purposes of a State motor vehicle driver's license\" must also be effective as to \nvoter registration). The Court is also not persuaded by Defendants' argument that they are \nexcused from processing online voter registration change of address submissions by language in \nthe NVRA that creates an exception to the simultaneous application requirement for driver's \nlicense applications and renewal applications where \"the applicant fails to sign the voter \nregistration application.\" 52 U.S.C.  20504(a)(l). As an initial matter, although Defendants \n§ \nprocess driver's license renewals and change of address submissions through a single combined \nonline system, the NVRA separately addresses change of address transactions and establishes no \nexplicit exemption from the simultaneous application requirement where they are unsigned. 52 \nU.S.C.  20504(d). Second, it is not disputed that each Plaintiff completed a submission through \n§ \nthe DPS online system, which required them to verify their identity at login and to execute an \naffirmation of citizenship before completing their submission. Defendants deemed these \nsubmissions sufficient to update driver's license informationtransactions that state law also \nrequires to be verified by an applicant's signature. 37 Tex. Admin. Code  15.21 (West). \n§ \nDefendants' online system does not provide a manner in which users may provide an additional \nsignature for the voter registration component of their submission, notwithstanding the NVRA's \nrequirement that the voter registration portion of the application must \"require[] the signature of \nof2l \n15 \n\nthe applicant, under penalty of perjury[.]\" 52 U.S.C.  20504(c)(2)(C)(iii). Defendants can hardly \n§ \nnow complain that Plaintiffs failed to sign the voter registration portion of the change of address \nsubmissionor argue that the NVRA does not apply to those submissionswhen Defendants \nthemselves, in violation of the NVRA, have made it impossible for Plaintiffs to do so. \nMoreover, the record in this case undercuts Defendants' claim that their heightened \nsignature requirement for voter registration renewal transactions is necessary to their system of \nsignature-based voter identity verification. The parties do not dispute that, because an initial \napplication for a driver's license cannot be submitted online, any prospective voter eligible to use \nthe DPS online system will have already provided the state with their signature when they made \ntheir initial application for a driver's license. Tex. Elec. Code Ann.  20.066. It is unclear why an \n§ \nadditional signature provided with a change of address form is necessary to enable comparison \nbetween the signature provided at the time of initial registration and the signature provided at the \npolls. Indeed, as Defendants have acknowledged, they do not require physical signatures to \nupdate voter registration change-of-address submissions in some circumstances. Docket no. 1-4 \nat 25 (\"registered voters who move within a single county may change their addresses online \nand, in so doing, automatically update their voter registration address\"); Tex. Elec. Code Ann. \n§ \n15.02 1(d) (West 2010) (\"A voter who continues to reside in the county in which the voter is \nregistered may correct information under this section by digital transmission of the \ninformation\"). This brings a crucial distinction into view. Defendants require that inter-county \nvoter registration change-of-address forms be signed not because that signature is necessary for \nthe state's signature-matching voter verification mechanismthe state is already in possession \nof2l \n16 \n\nof an electronic rendering of the voter's signature provided with their initial registration5but in \norder to avoid the expense and logistical burden of transmitting the voter's signature to the \ncounty of the voter's updated registration. Defendants note that \"[v]oter registration in Texas is, \nand has historically been, a county-based system\" and \"Defendants have not received a \nlegislative appropriation to provide for [the signature's] collection electronically [i.e., through \nthe DPS online system].\" Docket nos. 1-4 at 25; 7 at 2; 12 at 6. However, Defendants overlook \nthe fact that state law already requires the voter's signature to be collected electronically at the \ntime of their initial registration, Tex. Elec. Code Ann.  20.066, and that state law also already \n§ \nrequires the Secretary of State to maintain a statewide database of voter registration information \nthat must \"be available to any election official in the state through immediate electronic access.\"6 \nIf an applicant does not complete the voter registration portion of their initial driver's \nlicense applicationand thus seeks to submit an initial voter registration application with a \nrenewal driver's license applicationthe state is nonetheless already in possession of the \nsignature on the applicant's initial driver's license application, and can obtain the applicant's \nauthorization to use that signature for voter registration purposes, just as they would for the \nsignature provided on a mail-in voter registration renewal form. This is the approach taken by \nunsuccessful online voter registration proposals introduced in the Texas Legislature, \nsee, e.g., \nTex. H.B. 953, 84th Leg., R.S. (2015), as well as by the majority of the 38 U.S. states (plus the \nDistrict of Columbia) that currently permit online voter registration or have passed legislation to \ndo so. See, e.g., Cal. Elec.

Docket no. 1-4 at 26 & n.3. That estimate commented that \"the bill would \n17 of 21 \n\nTex. Elec. Code Ann.  18.061 (West 2010 & 2015 Supp.). In any event, Defendants cannot \n§ \nescape compliance with the NVRA because of a lack of state appropriations to fund compliance. \nVoting Rights Coal. v.  Wilson, 60 F.3d 1411, 1415 (9th Cir. 1995) (Congress' Election Clause \npower is \"intended to be borne by the states without compensation.\"). The Court is also not \npersuaded by Defendants' argument that its heightened signature requirement for voter \nregistration transactions is necessary for the integrity of those transactions. As noted above, the \nDPS online system includes identity verification measures and requires a user's affirmation of \ntheir eligibility to use the system, which the state deems sufficient to meet the signature \nrequirement for driver's license transactions. 37 Tex. Admin. Code  15.21. And the signature \n§ \nrequirement for voter registration changes is selectively applied to inter-county changes of \naddress, but not intra-county changes. \nThe straightforward reading of the statutory text makes the simultaneous application \nrequirement clear. That requirement applies to \"any renewal application\" as well as change of \naddress formsincluding the online submissions at issue in this case. 52 U.S.C.  20504(a)(1) \n§ \nand (d). This understanding of the NVRA's simultaneous application requirement does not \ncontradict the holding of the Fifth Circuit in Scott v. Schedler, which involved provisions of the \nNVRA that are not at issue here.7 It is consistent with the understanding of the NVRA's \nrequire [the Secretary of State] to obtain a digital copy of the applicant's signature from the \nDepartment of Public Safety (DPS)... [and] would require [the Secretary of State] to adopt... \nrules to provide for additional security measures[,]\" which would require two contractors at $100 \nper hour for 1040 hours, a projected expense of $208,000.

Ct. at 2253-54, 2256-59 (Elections Clause \n\"functions as a default provision; it invests the States with responsibility for the mechanics of \ncongressional elections, but only so far as Congress declines to pre-empt state legislative \nchoices.\"). It does not invalidate Texas's signature-matching voter verification mechanism, or \nTexas's signature requirement, but rather prohibits Texas from administering that requirement in \na manner that is inconsistent with its obligations under the NVRA. And as noted above, this \nunderstanding of the NVRA's simultaneous application requirement does not mean that states \nare required to establish online voter registration or online voting, docket no. 7 at 17-18; merely \nthat voter registration be offered equally with, and integrated into, driver's license applications, \nCir. 2014). The court held that, in light of a neighboring NVRA provision requiring that \nprospective voters be issued a check-box form to indicate whether they wished to register to vote \nand that advised that checking neither box would be \"deemed to constitute a declination to \nregister[,]\" a prospective voter who checked neither box had thus declined, \"in writing,\" to \nregister.

Where, as here, Defendants have \nchosen to offer an online forum for NVRA-covered driver's license transactions, the NVRA thus \nrequires them to accept voter registration applications through that forum simultaneously with \nthe NVRA-covered driver's license submissions the forum supports. \nIn short, the Court is not persuaded by Defendants' argument that they should be excused \nfrom the NVRA' s simultaneous application requirements with respect to certain transactions \nbecause the legislature has not provided them with the funding necessary to comply with a self- \nimposed heightened signature requirement that is only selectively applied to begin with. For \nthese reasons, the Court rejects Defendants' arguments and finds that Plaintiffs have stated a \nclaim under the NVRA. \nD.

Takushi, 504 U.S. 428, 434 (1992) (internal quotation marks omitted).9 In this case, \nthe state asserts that the burden on voter registration imposed by its policy of disallowing online \nThe Fifth Circuit has affirmed, without specifically ruling on, a district court's \napplication of the Burdick balancing analysis to equal protection claims raised in the context of \nvoting procedures. Kucinich v.  Texas Democratic Party, 563 F.3d 161, 168 n.6 (5th Cir. 2009). \nThe Sixth Circuit has explicitly held that this balancing test applies to equal protection claims \nthat involve burdening of voting rights through disparate treatment of voters. Obama for Am. v. \n20 of2l \n\nvoter registration changes of address is justified by its interest in verifying voter identity through \nsignature-matching at the poiis. This explanation is undercut by Defendants' failure, discussed \nabove, to explain how the signature on change of address forms is necessary to that signature- \nmatching verification, or to the integrity of the voter registration change-of-address process, \ngiven that existing state law requires that the state be in possession of the signature of each \neligible user of the DPS online system. Indeed, Defendants' arguments in this case suggest that \ntheir asserted interest is not in obtaining a signature on change of address forms, but in avoiding \nthe expense of transmitting the signature they already have to election officials in the county \nwhere the voter registers. This interest is insufficient to justify the burden imposed on voters, \nparticularly since the policy it seeks to justify, for the reasons discussed above, is contrary to the \nNVRA's simultaneous application requirements. \nConclusion \nFor these reasons, the Court finds that standing has been established and that Plaintiffs \nhave stated claims upon which relief can be granted under both the NVRA and the Equal \nProtection Clause. Therefore, Defendants' motion to dismiss (docket no. 7) is DENIED. \nIT IS SO ORDERED this 31st day of March, 2017. \nORLANDO L.

Further, this case has always involved the same legal question: \ndoes the NVRA require Defendants to provide a simultaneous and seamless voter registration \napplication during online driver’s license transactions? As this Court held in its Order, the \nanswer is clearly “yes.”3 For these reasons and as set out below, Defendants’ MSJ should be \ndenied.  \nARGUMENT \nI.  Plaintiffs have statutory and Article III standing. \nDefendants once again claim that Plaintiffs lack standing, asserting, at times verbatim, \nmany of the same arguments they put before the Court in their MTD. The parties fully briefed \nthis issue at that time, and the Court denied Defendants’ motion, rejecting the same standing \narguments raised again in Defendants’ MSJ. The Court should reject Defendants’ arguments \nonce more.  \n                                                 \n1 Compare generally MTD, Dkt. 7, and Defendants’ MSJ, Dkt. 82. Incredibly, there is not a \nsingle mention of the Court’s Order on the MTD in the State’s MSJ. \n2 Dkt. 9. \n3 By their conduct, Defendants have also violated Plaintiffs’ Fourteenth Amendment right to \nequal protection. \n1 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 85   Filed 07/28/17   Page 6 of 23\nA.  Plaintiffs have standing under the NVRA because Defendants failed to correct \nthe NVRA violations after Plaintiffs provided proper notice. \n1.  Plaintiffs  have  standing  under  the  NVRA  because  each  was  aggrieved  by \nTexas’s failure to register them to vote in elections for federal office.  \n \nDefendants claim that because Dr. Woods’ first opportunity to cast a ballot following his \nonline driver’s license transaction was in a state election, not a federal one, he has no claim \nunder the NVRA.4 Disenfranchisement in a federal election is not, however, the only cognizable \ninjury under the NVRA.  Instead,  each Plaintiff—including Dr. Woods—was injured  at the \nmoment the State failed to provide a simultaneous voter registration application with an online \ndriver’s license transaction with the Department of Public Safety (“DPS”).5 \nMoreover, the State’s argument relies on a false dichotomy that does not exist in Texas. \nAlthough the NVRA governs voter registration for elections “for federal office”—as opposed to \nelections for state office—where, as here, a state combines voter registration procedures for \nfederal and state elections, the combined procedure is necessarily governed by the NVRA.6 In \nthis case, because the State failed to update Plaintiffs’ voter registration for elections for federal \n                                                 \n4 Defendants mischaracterize Dr. Woods’ address history. Dr. Woods lived in Austin from 2007 \nuntil 2014, when he moved to West Virginia to live temporarily while working at West Virginia \nUniversity as a postdoctoral fellow, with the intent of maintaining Austin as his home and \nresidence.  In  2015,  after  accepting  a  job  offer,  Dr.  Woods  moved  to  Harris  County,  and \nthereafter transacted with DPS online to update his driver’s license address.  Appx. 8-13 (Ex. 1, \nExcerpts from May 5, 2017 Deposition of John Woods (“Woods Dep.”)  18:4-7; 19:14-20; 32:3-\n33:1; 62:11-22; 77:4-17). \n5 Dkt. 25 at 4. \n6 See Dkt. 77-1, Appx. 137-138 (Ex. 19, Texas Voter Registration Application) (Texas’s general \nform for voter registration—for both federal and state elections); see also Ass’n of Cmty. Orgs. \nfor Reform Now v. Miller, 129 F.3d 833, 837 (6th Cir. 1997) (noting that, although the NVRA \ndoes not prohibit states from adopting separate registration requirements for the election of state \nofficials, the NVRA will affect registration procedures for state and local elections to the extent \nstates combine these registration procedures with federal registration procedures as a matter of \nconvenience).  \n  2 \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 85   Filed 07/28/17   Page 7 of 23\noffice after each indicated they wished to register to vote during an online driver’s license \ntransaction, they have been “aggrieved by a violation” of the NVRA.7  \n  The  cases  cited  by  Defendants  do  not  support  a  contrary  result.  In  Dobrovolny  v. \nNebraska, 100 F. Supp. 2d 1012 (D. Neb. 2000), plaintiffs sought to place an initiative on \nNebraska’s  general  election  ballot.  When  they  could  not  obtain  a  sufficient  percentage  of \nsignatures from voters registered in the state to qualify the initiative for placement on the ballot, \nthey challenged the state’s voter-registration-list maintenance procedures under the NVRA.  Id. \nat 1018-1020. It is in this context that the court observed that the Elections Clause “does not give \nCongress the power to directly regulate state voter registration procedures in state elections or \nstate ballot issues.” Id. at 1028 (citation omitted). Here, Plaintiffs are not challenging voter list \nmaintenance or anything to do with “state elections or state ballot issues.” Rather, they are \nchallenging Texas’s refusal to register eligible voters for elections for federal office during \nonline driver’s license transactions in violation of the NVRA. Each has standing under the \nNVRA to do so.  \n  In Broyles v. Texas, 618 F. Supp. 2d, 661, 677 (S.D. Tex. 2009), the plaintiffs alleged, \ninter alia, that they were unable to vote on a “municipal incorporation issue” after attempting to \nupdate their voter registration during driver’s license transactions online. The court held that, \nbecause the Plaintiffs did not allege or present “evidence of registration problems that affected \ntheir right to vote in a federal election or on any issue beyond the incorporation issue[,]” they did \nnot have a cause of action under the NVRA. Id. at 691. The Fifth Circuit affirmed, holding that \nthe district court applied the correct standard in ruling on Defendants’ Rule 12(b)(6) motion, and \nfinding that the dismissal of the NVRA claims was not in error.  Broyles v. Texas, 381 Fed. \nAppx. 370, 372, 373 n.1 (5th Cir. 2010). \n                                                 \n7 52 U.S.C. § 20510(b)(1). \n  3 \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 85   Filed 07/28/17   Page 8 of 23\nIn this case, Plaintiffs allege, and the record proves, that Texas violates the NVRA in \nseveral ways, including by “failing to establish procedures ‘to register to vote in elections for \nFederal office . . . by application made simultaneously with an application for a motor vehicle \ndriver’s license pursuant to section 20504” of the NVRA.8 Therefore, each Plaintiff suffered an \ninjury  under  the  NVRA  when  the  State  failed  to  offer  a  simultaneous  voter  registration \napplication during an online driver’s license transaction. That Dr. Woods was subsequently \nregistered to vote for federal elections following his attempt to cast a ballot in a state election \ndoes not negate his original injury under the NVRA. See Arcia v. Florida Sec’y of State, 772 \nF.3D 1335, 1341 (11th Cir. 2014) (finding that individual voters removed from the rolls in \nviolation of Section 8 of the NVRA had standing to sue for prospective relief even after they \nwere reinstated). Similarly, that Mr. Stringer and Mr. Hernandez were subsequently registered to \nvote for future federal elections following their inability to cast a full ballot in the 2014 federal \nelection  does  not  support  Defendants’  claim  that  they  were  not  aggrieved  by  Defendants’ \nviolation of the NVRA. \n2.  Defendants  did  not  correct  their  NVRA  violations  by  offering  to  update \nPlaintiffs’ voter registration. \nThe NVRA provides a private cause of action to address state violations of its mandates.9 \nIn order to sue a state for violating the NVRA, Plaintiffs are first required to send “written notice \n[of violations of the NVRA] to the chief election official of the state.”10 “If a violation is not \ncorrected within 90 days after receipt of a notice . . . the aggrieved person may bring a civil \naction in an appropriate district court for declaratory or injunctive relief with respect to the \nviolation.”11  \n                                                 \n8 Complaint, Dkt. 1 at ¶ 62; see generally Plaintiffs’ MSJ, Dkt. 77. \n9 52 U.S.C. § 20510(b). \n10 Id. at § 20510(b)(1). \n11 Id. at § 20510(b)(2). \n  4 \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 85   Filed 07/28/17   Page 9 of 23\nHere, Defendants do not argue that Plaintiffs failed to notify the Secretary of State \n(“SOS”) that Texas violates the NVRA. Instead, Defendants insist that Plaintiffs lack standing \nbecause Defendants “took action to correct any alleged voter registration issue each Plaintiff \nhad.”12 Just as they did in the MTD, Defendants rely on Scott v. Schedler, 771 F.3d 831 (5th Cir. \n2014), to support this proposition.13 Scott, however, centered on noncompliance with Section 7 \nof the NVRA, which requires certain state agencies to provide mail voter registration application \nforms along with applications for public benefits unless the applicant declines, in writing, to \nregister to vote.14 Here, the State’s violations are of the “Motor Voter” requirements of Section 5 \nof the NVRA, a portion of the statute wholly distinct from that which was addressed in Scott. \nIn this case, Texas cannot correct its NVRA violations by merely providing a mail-in \nvoter registration form or offering to correct voter registration as to each Plaintiff.15 In order to \ncorrect the violations Plaintiffs complained of in their notice letters, Defendants must allow for \nonline driver’s license applications to also serve as voter registration applications.16 Indeed, if \nstates could immunize themselves from suit in the way Defendants urge, no individual voter \ncould ever enforce compliance with Section 5 of the NVRA, frustrating Congress’ intent to \ncreate a private right of action.17  Instead, as this Court stated in denying Defendants’ MTD, \n“[t]he  notice  requirements  of  the  NVRA  are  intended  to  encourage  parties  to  pursue  pre-\nlitigation resolution of their NVRA suits, but they do not immunize a defendant from suit merely \nbecause the defendant claims to have attempted some compliance.”18 Because Defendants have \n                                                 \n12 Dkt. 82 at 13. \n13 Dkt. 82 at 13-14. \n14 52 U.S.C. § 20506(a)(6)(A)(i). \n15 See id. at § 20510(b)(2). \n16 Id. at § 20504(a). \n17 Id. at § 20510. \n18 Order, Dkt. 52 at 9.  \n  5 \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 85   Filed 07/28/17   Page 10 of 23\nyet to correct the NVRA violations Plaintiffs complain of, Plaintiffs have statutory standing \npursuant to the plain terms of the NVRA. \nDefendants also claim that Plaintiffs do not have standing to assert claims on behalf of \nothers under the NVRA because they are not organizational plaintiffs.19 The NVRA, however, \ndoes  not specifically address organizational standing whatsoever, and  instead gives explicit \nauthority for an individual to bring suit for state violations of the NVRA so long as that person \nhas been aggrieved by the violation and has given the state the requisite pre-suit notice.20 \nAccordingly, numerous individual plaintiffs have brought suit successfully under the NVRA \nsince its enactment in  1993, achieving injunctive relief that has led to policy  change. See \ngenerally Arcia v. Fla. Sec’y of State, 772 F.3d 1335, 1341 (11th Cir. 2014); Arizona v. Inter \nTribal Council of Arizona, Inc., 133 S.Ct. 2247, 2252 (2013).  \nMoreover, nothing in Scott (or any other case) supports Defendants’ wild claim that only \norganizational plaintiffs may seek relief that benefits others; instead, Scott merely affirmed the \nwell-known principle that an organization has standing to sue on its own behalf where it satisfies \nstatutory and Constitutional criteria. 771 F.3d 837-840. Additionally, Defendants attempt to \nconfuse the issue at hand by alleging Plaintiffs do not have standing to bring suit on behalf of \nothers because they lack standing themselves. This is wrong—as demonstrated above, Plaintiffs \nhave standing to assert their own claims under the NVRA and nothing in the NVRA or Scott \nprevents Plaintiffs from requesting injunctive relief that would benefit millions of other Texans. \nAs noted previously, because Plaintiffs were each aggrieved by Defendants’ continued violations \nof Section 5 of the NVRA and provided the proper pre-suit notice, Plaintiffs have standing.  \n                                                 \n19 Dkt. 80 at 14-15. \n20 52 U.S.C. 20510(b)(2).  \n  6 \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 85   Filed 07/28/17   Page 11 of 23\nB.  Plaintiffs have Article III standing. \n  Both parties and this Court agree that Article III standing requires three elements: (1) an \ninjury-in-fact; (2) causation; and (3) redressability. Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Envtl. \nServs.  (TOC),  Inc.,  528  U.S.  167,  181  (2000).  Defendants  challenge  only  causation  and \nredressability  in  both  their  MTD  and  their  MSJ.21  And  this  Court  previously  rejected \nDefendants’ MTD arguments on these issues.22 \n1.  Plaintiffs’  injuries  were  caused  by  Defendants’  failure  to  comply  with  the \nNVRA. \nAs they did in their MTD, Defendants again argue that Plaintiffs caused their own \ninjuries, and that they lack Article III standing as a result. This Court has already found that \n“Defendants’ argument that Plaintiffs are responsible for their own injury because they failed to \ncomplete the state’s registration process overlooks the two-fold nature of Plaintiffs’ claimed \ninjury.”23  As  the Court noted,  Plaintiffs  allege  that  the  state’s  registration  process  is  itself \nunlawful, and thus allege not only disenfranchisement, but also a violation of their statutory right \nto “[s]imultaneous application for voter registration and…driver’s license[.]”24  \nThe Court thus held that Plaintiffs’ “statutory injury remains cognizable regardless of \nwhether  Plaintiffs  completed  the  voter  registration  process  that  they  challenge.”25  That  is, \nPlaintiffs were not required to retrieve, print, complete, and mail a separate voter registration \napplication in order to challenge the legality of Texas’s failure to register them during their \nonline driver’s license transactions. It is this failure by Defendants, and not the Plaintiffs, that \n                                                 \n21 See Dkt. 7 at 7; Dkt. 82 at 15. \n22 Dkt. 52 at 3-7. \n23 Dkt. 52 at 4. \n24 Id. (citing 52 U.S.C. § 20504). \n25 Dkt. 52 at 4. Just as in their MTD, Defendants again rely only on Westfall v. Miller for the \nproposition that “injury stemming from plaintiff’s own inaction severs causal link between injury \nand any conduct by the defendant.” 77 F.3d 868, 871 (5th Cir. 1996). This is a misleading \nsummary of this case and even so, Westfall v. Miller is distinguishable from the case at hand, as \nthis Court noted in its Order Denying Defendants’ MTD. Dkt. 52 at 4. \n  7 \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 85   Filed 07/28/17   Page 12 of 23\ncaused  Plaintiffs’  injuries.  Defendants  raise  no  new  arguments  justifying  a  different  result.  \nAccordingly, in the interest of brevity, Plaintiffs refer the Court back to their briefing in response \nto Defendants’ MTD, specifically discussing why Defendants arguments once again fail.26 \n2.  Plaintiffs’ claims present a live, redressable controversy. \na.  Plaintiffs’ claims are not moot.  \nPlaintiffs’ claims were live when they filed their Complaint,27 and they remain so today, \nas the central facts have not changed. Defendants claim that this case is moot because Plaintiffs \nare currently registered to vote at their desired addresses, and do not intend to try to update their \nvoter registration via online transaction with DPS.28 Defendants’ position is, frankly, completely \nwrong—unsupported by the NVRA, case law or common sense. In fact, the unlawful policies \nthat caused Plaintiffs injuries are ongoing, and Defendants have indicated, in no uncertain terms, \nthat they will not change their processes unless the Court intervenes. Because Defendants made \nthis  exact  argument  in  their  MTD,  Plaintiffs  incorporate  fully  their  arguments  from  their \nResponse to Defendants’ MTD.29  \nb.  The capable-of repetition exception to mootness applies. \nEven  if,  arguendo,  Plaintiffs’  claims  were  somehow  now  moot  under  a  standard \nmootness  analysis,  this  Court  has  already  held  that  the  capable-of-repetition  exception  to \nmootness applies to this case.30  The exception applies where “(1) the challenged action is in its \nduration  too  short  to  be  fully  litigated  prior  to  cessation  or  expiration,  and  (2)  there  is  a \nreasonable expectation that the same complaining party will be subject to the same action again.” \n                                                 \n26 Dkt. 9 at 6-9.  \n27 Dkt. 52 at 5. \n28 Dkt. 82 at 16. Plaintiffs do intend to transact online with DPS in the future and, if the State \nwere compelled to comply with the NVRA, would update their voter registration through future \nonline transactions with DPS. See Appx. 16-17 (Ex. 2, Aff. of Jarrod Stringer); Appx. 19-20 (Ex. \n3, Aff. of Benjamin Hernandez); Appx. 22-23 (Ex. 4, Aff. of John Woods). \n29 Dkt. 9 at 11-12. \n30 Dkt. 52 at 6. \n  8 \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 85   Filed 07/28/17   Page 13 of 23\nDavis v. Fed. Election Comm’n, 554 U.S. 724, 735 (2008) (rejecting mootness argument despite \nthe fact that an election had passed).  \nThe  Supreme  Court  and  the  Fifth  Circuit  have  held  that  the  capable-of-repetition \nexception to the mootness doctrine is particularly applicable to election law cases, and have thus \nrepeatedly allowed lawsuits to proceed even where the election has passed and petitioners were \nregistered to vote. Rosario v. Rockefeller, 410 U.S. 752, 756 n.5 (1973) (noting that although the \nelection at issue was completed and petitioners would be eligible to vote in the next election, the \ncase was not moot since the capable-of-repetition exception applied); Dunn v. Blumstein, 405 \nU.S. 330, 333 n.2 (1972) (agreeing with the district court’s finding that a voter’s issue was not \nmoot despite the fact that he could vote at the time of the decision because the problem to voters \nposed  by  the  state’s  voting  requirements  was  capable-of-repetition,  but  evading  review); \nKucinich v. Tex.

Brown, 415 U.S. 724, 737 n.8 \n(1974)).  \nPlaintiffs satisfy both prongs of the capable-of-repetition exception. Defendants do not \ndispute that Plaintiffs meet the first prong; rather they claim that Plaintiffs do not satisfy the \n“same complaining party” standard of the second prong.31 This argument fails for the reasons \nthat follow.  \ni.  Plaintiffs meet the “same complaining party” standard. \n  With regard to Article III standing, Defendants add a single new argument: they urge this \nCourt  to  strictly  apply  the  “same  complaining  party”  requirement  of  the  second  prong  for \n                                                 \n31 Dkt. 82 at 17-19. \n  9 \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 85   Filed 07/28/17   Page 14 of 23\ncapable-of-repetition  exception  to  mootness.32  For  the  reasons  set  out  below,  Defendants’ \nargument here is misplaced, and in any event, Plaintiffs satisfy even a narrow view of “same \ncomplaining party” standard as they will continue to suffer the same injury at issue in this case. \nDefendants argue that Plaintiffs will not be subject to the same injuries again because \nthey each testified that in the future, they will not attempt to update their voter registration \ninformation during an online transaction with DPS.33 But standing does not depend on whether \nPlaintiffs will attempt to do the impossible—update their voter registration through the DPS’s \nonline driver’s license update and renewal process—when they know it will not work. The real \nquestion is whether Plaintiffs will continue to suffer the same injury at issue in this case. As \nexplained below, they most assuredly will. \nDefendants’ assertions on this point are misleading—intentionally so. It is due to lack of \nopportunity, of course, rather than lack of desire, that Plaintiffs will not attempt to update their \nvoter registration in this way. Knowing now that the State failed to update their voter registration \ninformation  in  connection  with  their  NVRA-covered  online  driver’s  license  transactions, \nPlaintiffs will not fruitlessly attempt to update their voter registration through DPS’s online \ndriver’s license change-of-address and renewal system in the future, unless and until that system \nis brought into compliance with the NVRA.34 Importantly, Plaintiffs do intend to continue using \nTexas’s online system for driver’s license change-of-address and renewals35 and therefore will \nsuffer  future  violations  of  their  statutory  right  to  a  “[s]imultaneous  application  for  voter \n                                                 \n32 Dkt. 82 at 18.  \n33 Dkt. 82 at 17-18. \n34 See Appx. 16-17 (Ex. 2, Aff. of Jarrod Stringer); Appx. 19-20 (Ex. 3, Aff. of Benjamin \nHernandez); Appx. 22-23 (Ex. 4, Aff. of John Woods). \n35 See Appx. 16-17 (Ex. 2, Aff. of Jarrod Stringer); Appx. 19-20 (Ex. 3, Aff. of Benjamin \nHernandez); Appx. 22-23 (Ex. 4, Aff. of John Woods). \n  10 \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 85   Filed 07/28/17   Page 15 of 23\nregistration and. . . driver’s license.”36 Thus, Texas’s enduring failure to comply with Section 5 \nof  the  NVRA,  by  refusing  to  allow  online  DPS  transactions  to  serve  as  voter  registration \napplications, will continue to harm each Plaintiff until the State is forced to comply.  \nii.  The Court should construe the “same complaining party” requirement \nliberally. \nIf there were any question—and there is not—that Plaintiffs themselves might not be \ninjured by Defendants’ violations of the NVRA, Plaintiffs still meet the “same complaining \nparty” prong of the capable-of-repetition exception to mootness because other Texans will suffer \nfrom Defendants’ continued violations. As discussed more fully below, the Supreme Court has \nrelaxed the “same complaining party” requirement in election law cases, many times finding the \nprong is satisfied even where the plaintiffs do not assert that they will suffer future injury. \nDefendants point to Smith v. Winter, 782 F.2d 508, 510 (5th Cir. 1986), to argue that the \nFifth Circuit has construed the “same complaining party” requirement narrowly, and to insist that \nthis Court should do the same by reviewing only whether the individual Plaintiffs will continue \nto suffer the injury complained of here.37 Winter is, however, both distinguishable from the \npresent  case  and  outdated—subsequent  case  law  construes  the  “same  complaining  party” \nrequirement more liberally.  \nWinter was brought by elected officials subjected to a recall election, which they won \nbefore the court came to a decision. The Fifth Circuit held that the case was moot because the \nPlaintiffs did not satisfy either prong of the capable-of-repetition exception, finding “there is no \n                                                 \n36 52 U.S.C. § 20504, Dkt. 52 at 4.  \n37 Dkt. 52 at 18. Defendants assert that the Court should rely on Winter because, as the earliest \ncited Fifth Circuit case, it controls. The Fifth Circuit’s “earliest opinion” rule directs that “where \ntwo previous holdings or lines of precedent conflict, the earlier opinion controls and is the \nbinding precedent in this Circuit, absent an intervening holding to the contrary by the Supreme \nCourt or this court en banc.” See Rios v. City of Del Rio, Tex., 444 F.3d 417, 425, 425 n.8 (5th \nCir. 2006) (emphasis added). As is evident from the discussion herein, Defendants’ reliance on \nthis rule is misplaced. \n  11 \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 85   Filed 07/28/17   Page 16 of 23\nallegation or showing otherwise that appellants will be subjected to another recall petition.” 782 \nF.2d at 510. The specific and rare occurrence of a recall election cannot be compared with the \nvoter registration processes at DPS, which are ongoing and affect up to 1.4 million Texans \nannually.38 Plaintiffs, along with millions of other Texans, will certainly need to renew their \ndriver’s licenses or change their addresses (and therefore their voter registration) at some future \ntime,  and  millions  of  those  same  individuals,  including  Plaintiffs,  will  transact  with  DPS \nonline.39  \nAs Defendants acknowledge, the Fifth Circuit has in fact declined to find a claim moot \nwhere a Plaintiff “would be governed by the same flawed law in the next election.” Kucinich , \n563 F.3d at 164. In Kucinich, a former candidate for President challenged the Democratic Party’s \nrequirement that prospective candidates commit to supporting the Democratic Party’s eventual \nnominee. Id. at 163. Although the election had already passed, and the Plaintiff did not state any \nplan to run again, the Fifth Circuit applied Supreme Court precedent and declined to hold the \ncase  moot  when  “the  issues  properly  presented,  and  their  effects  [  ],  will  persist  as  the \n[restrictions] are applied in future elections.” Id. at 164-65 (quoting Storer  415 U.S. at 737 n.8). \nThe Fifth Circuit recently affirmed this approach in Wilson v. Birnberg, noting: \nWe concluded in Kucinich that in election-law cases, the Supreme Court has not \nalways required that there be a likelihood that the same complaining party will be \nsubject to the challenged action later. On some occasions, the Court has dispensed \nwith the same-party requirement and focused instead upon the great likelihood \nthat the issue will recur between the defendant and other members of the public at \nlarge. We agree with a Sixth Circuit judge that the Supreme Court, this Court, and \nseveral of this Court’s sister circuits have relaxed the same party requirement in \nthe election law context.  \n \n                                                 \n38 See Appx. 25 (Ex. 5, DPS Transactions Summary Chart, Produced as Ex. 3-Y to Mar. 7, 2017 \n30(b)(6) Deposition of Sheri Gipson showing 1,448,941 customers transacted with DPS online in \n2016); Appx. 31 (Ex. 6, Excerpts from Gipson 30(b)(6) Dep., 140:12-14, 141:8-12). \n39 Id.; Appx. 16-17 (Ex. 2, Aff. of Jarrod Stringer); Appx. 19-20 (Ex. 3, Aff. of Benjamin \nHernandez); Appx. 22-23 (Ex. 4, Aff. of John Woods).  \n  12 \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 85   Filed 07/28/17   Page 17 of 23\n667 F.3d 591, 596 (2012) (internal quotations and citations omitted). \n  The injury at issue here will certainly recur, not only between Plaintiffs and Defendants, \nbut also between Defendants and millions of similarly situated Texans—a point this Court has \nalready recognized.40 Just between September 2013 and February 2015, more than 1,800 Texans \nformally complained about the issues addressed in this case,41 and the State admits that almost \n1.5 million people are affected annually.42 Ultimately, this Court has already found Plaintiffs’ \ncontroversy to be one “which is capable of repetition, yet evading review,”43 and it should \nreassert that finding.  \nC.  There is no state-law loophole in the NVRA. \n  In their MSJ, Defendants claim that the NVRA incorporates conflicting Texas law by \nrequiring that NVRA-covered transactions “also comply with applicable state law[,]” including \nTexas’s requirement that voter registration applications be signed.44 This Court has already \nrejected this precise argument, holding that Defendants’ “circular and self-defeating reading of \nthe NVRA is contrary to the statutory text, which imposes the ‘in accordance with state law’ \nrequirement not upon voter registration transactions, but upon the driver’s license transactions \nwith which they must be simultaneous.”45  Here, because it is undisputed that a customer who \nrenews his driver’s license or changes his address during an online transaction with DPS has \ndone so “in accordance with state law”—which does not require that the customer provide a new \nsignature during that transaction—the NVRA requires that Defendants accept voter registration \n                                                 \n40 Dkt. 52 at 6. \n41 Answer, Dkt. 57 at ¶ 9. \n42 Appx. 25 (Ex. 5, DPS Transactions Summary Chart, Produced as Ex. 3-Y to Gipson 30(b)(6) \nDep.) \n43 Dkt. 52 at 6. \n44 Dkt. 82 at 19-20. In their MSJ, Defendants cite Betsy Schonhoff’s testimony to support their \nlegal arguments regarding the NVRA’s operation when applied alongside conflicting state law. \nSee Dkt. 82. However, these legal conclusions are squarely and more appropriately within the \npurview of this Court to decide. \n45 Dkt. 52 at 15 (citing 52 U.S.C. §§ 20504(a)(1), (d)) (emphasis added). \n  13 \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 85   Filed 07/28/17   Page 18 of 23\napplications  and  updates  to  voter  registration  files  simultaneously  with  these  online \ntransactions.46  \n  Defendants’ claim that the Elections Clause gives Texas the prerogative to impose voter \nregistration requirements for NVRA-covered transactions that conflict with those set out in the \nNVRA itself is, likewise, simply wrong. Instead, “the power the Elections Clause confers is none \nother than the power to pre-empt[,]”Inter Tribal Council, 133 S.Ct. at 2257, and the NVRA does \njust that, pre-empting any state voter registration laws that are inconstant with its mandates. Id. \n(“When  Congress  legislates  with  respect  to  the  ‘Times,  Places  and  Manner’  of  holding \ncongressional elections, it necessarily displaces some element of a pre-existing legal regime \nerected by the States.”) (emphasis in original).47 Since the NVRA requires states to provide voter \nregistration applications simultaneous with and as part of driver’s license applications, any Texas \nlaw or rule requiring that customers transacting with DPS online complete a second, separate \ntransaction with SOS in order to register to vote or update their voter registration information is \ninconsistent with—and therefore pre-empted by—the NVRA.48  \nIn fact, anticipating this exact argument from states, Congress considered procedures like \nTexas’s and deemed them inadequate: \nIt would not be sufficient under the terms of this legislation for a State motor \nvehicles office merely to make a voter registration application available upon \nrequest to a license applicant . . . Likewise, it would not be sufficient to provide a \nvoter registration application separate from the license application.49 \n                                                 \n46 Tex. Transp. Code §§ 521.054 (requiring that license holders notify DPS of a new address and \napply for a duplicate license within 30 days), 521.146(c) (allowing applicants for duplicate \nlicenses  to  apply  “over  the  Internet”),  521.274(a)  (allowing  license  holders  to  renew  their \ndriver’s licenses “over the Internet”); Appx. 32 (Ex. 6, Gipson 30(b)(6) Dep. 203:17-18 (“for the \nonline process, we are not collecting a new signature as part of that process.”)); see also Dkt. 52 \nat 20. \n47 See also Dkt. 52 at 14; Dkt. 77 at 2-3. \n48 52 U.S.C. § 20504, Dkt. 52 at 11, 14.  \n49 S.

As set out in Plaintiffs’ MSJ and in this Court’s Order, the NVRA mandates that any \nchange-of-address transaction sufficient under state law to notify the state of a change of address \nfor driver’s license purposes should also notify the state of the change for voter registration \npurposes, unless the customer says otherwise.51 Since neither the NVRA nor Texas law requires \nthat these online driver’s license change-of-address notifications include a signature, Defendants’ \ninsistence upon one is a plain violation of the NVRA.  \nFurthermore,  every  customer  renewing  his  driver’s  license  online  (or  changing  his \naddress online, for that matter) has already provided his electronic signature—the signature used \nby Defendants and county registrars for voter registration purposes—to DPS.52 To the extent \n                                                 \n50 Dkt. 82 at 21. \n51 Contrary to Defendants’ claims, Plaintiffs would not have states treat all driver’s license \nchange-of-address  transactions  as  updates  for  voter  registration  purposes.  Instead,  where  a \ncustomer “states on the form that the change of address is not for voter registration purposes,” \nhis voter registration should not be updated with his new address. 52 U.S.C. § 20504(d); Dkt. 77 \nat 17. Previously, the response to the prompt “I want to register to vote” on DPS’s online driver’s \nlicense forms defaulted to “no.” Dkt. 77 at n. 26. Now, however, DPS does not even allow \ncustomers to indicate that they do or do not wish to register to vote during an online driver’s \nlicense transaction. See Dkt. 77-1 at Appx. 143 (Ex. 20, Driver’s License Renewal and Change-\nof-Address screen shots).  \n52 Indeed, a customer “who does not have a digital image (e.g. photograph or signature) on file \nwith the department” is not even eligible to renew his driver’s license online. 37 Tex. Admin. \nCode 15.59(e)(7). To support their claim that online DPS customers must fill out and sign a \nphysical voter registration form, Defendants point out that, under state law, a voter registration \napplication must be in writing and signed by the applicant. Dkt. 82 at 8-10. This argument, \nhowever, ignores the fact that DPS customers do not, in fact, actually sign a voter registration \nform. Rather, as the process currently works, relevant data points (including the customer’s \nelectronic signature) are pulled from the DPS database, sent to the SOS’s database, and used to \npopulate a voter registration form the DPS customer never even sees, fills out, or signs. See Dkt. \n77-1, Appx. 98 (Ex. 13, SOS’s Suppl. Resps. to Jarrod Stringer’s First RFAs, No. 13); Dkt. 77-1, \n  15 \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 85   Filed 07/28/17   Page 20 of 23\nDefendants contend the NVRA would require them to collect a second signature during an online \ndriver’s license renewal transaction, they can hardly claim that because they make it impossible \nfor customers to provide such a second signature, the transactions escape the NVRA’s clear \nmandate.53  Instead,  because  they  offer  NVRA-covered  renewal  and  change-of-address \ntransactions  online,  Defendants  must  conform  them  to  the  NVRA’s  requirement  that  they \nsimultaneously serve as applications for or updates to voter registration. \nD.  Defendants violate the Equal Protection Clause as a matter of law.  \n1.  The Anderson-Burdick test controls. \nIn their MSJ, Defendants continue to misunderstand how the Equal Protection Clause \napplies in cases involving the right to vote. As they did in their MTD, Defendants argue that “to \nestablish an equal protection claim, a plaintiff must establish that a similarly-situated comparator \nwas treated differently.”54 Defendants fail to cite any Equal Protection Clause cases that involve \nstate burdens on the right to vote to support their argument.55  \nAs  set  out  in  Plaintiffs’  MSJ,  courts  use  the  standard  established  in  Anderson  v. \nCelebrezze, 460 U.S. 780 (1983) and Burdick v. Takushi, 504 U.S. 428 (1992) when assessing an \n                                                                                                                                                             \nAppx. 43 (Ex. 6, Ingram 30(b)(6) Dep. 173:9-10); Dkt. 77-1, Appx. 110 (Ex. 14, Excerpt from \nSecretary of State’s 32nd Annual Election Law Seminar, Voter Registration 102 presentation, \nP003060, Voter Registration Presentation, slide 14, P003982 at P003995) (produced to Plaintiffs \nas  Bates  number  D_00008318-8354,  which  Defendants  marked  as  “confidential”  and  so \nPlaintiffs’ did not attach to their MSJ).  \n53 Dkt. 52 at 15-16. \n54 Dkt. 82 at 24. Defendants also claim that “the term ‘similarly-situated’ is a ‘stringent standard’ \nthat is defined narrowly and requires the comparator to be treated more favorably in ‘nearly \nidentical’  circumstances.”  Id.  The  cases  Defendants  rely  on  to  define  the  term  “similarly-\nsituated” are not Equal Protection cases, but employment discrimination cases involving Title \nVII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 or 42 U.S.C. § 1981. Dkt. 82 at 24 (citing Hockman v. \nWestward Comm., LLC, 282 F. Supp. 2d 512, 527–28 (E.D. Tex. 2003); Wheeler v. BL Dev. \nCorp., 415 F.3d 399, 405 (5th Cir. 2005)). Additionally, “nearly identical” is not used to define \nthe term “similarly-situated.” Dkt. 82 at 24; Wheeler v. BL Dev. Corp., 415 F.3d 399, 405 (5th \nCir. 2005) (citing Mayberry v. Vought Aircraft Co., 55 F.3d 1086, 1090 (5th Cir. 1995) (“To \nestablish disparate treatment, a plaintiff must demonstrate that a ‘similarly situated’ employee \nunder ‘nearly identical’ circumstances, was treated differently.”)). \n55 Dkt. 82 at 24. \n  16 \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 85   Filed 07/28/17   Page 21 of 23\nEqual Protection Clause challenge to a state burden on the right to vote. Crawford v. Marion Cty. \nElection, 553 U.S. 181, 190-191 (2008). Under the Anderson-Burdick standard, when a state \nrestriction burdens the right to vote, the state must identify relevant and legitimate state interests \nsufficiently weighty to justify the burden. Crawford, 553 U.S. at 190; Obama for Am. v. Husted, \n697  F.3d  423,  428  (6th  Cir.  2012).  Courts  apply  the  Anderson-Burdick  standard  even  to \nnondiscriminatory restrictions by which a state burdens not only a plaintiff’s right to vote, but \nalso the right to vote of all other voters. Burdick, 504 U.S. at 434 (applying Anderson’s balancing \napproach  to  nondiscriminatory  state  restriction);  Northeast  Ohio  Coal.  for  the  Homeless  v. \nHusted,  837  F.3d  612,  633  (6th  Cir.  2016)  (applying  the  Anderson-Burdick  standard  to \nnondiscriminatory  state  restriction,  and  holding  that  the  state  restriction  violated  the  Equal \nProtection Clause) (cert. denied, 2017 WL 881266 (U.S. June 19, 2017)).  \n2.  The Anderson-Burdick test mandates judgment in Plaintiffs’ favor on their \nEqual Protection claims.  \n As explained in Plaintiffs’ MSJ, there is no dispute that Texas treats some driver’s \nlicense applications as applications to register to vote, and also does not treat other driver’s \nlicense applications (online) as applications to register to vote.56 Texas burdens customers who \ntransact with DPS online with a requirement that they retrieve, complete, print, and mail an \nentirely separate voter registration form in order to register or update their voter registration \ninformation.57 As explained in detail in Plaintiffs’ MSJ, Texas’s burden on those who transact \nwith DPS online and wish to register to vote lacks a rational reason—much less a sufficiently \nweighty justification. It thus violates the Equal Protection Clause because the burden is arbitrary \nand unreasonable.58  \nCONCLUSION \n                                                 \n56 Dkt. 77 at 20. \n57 Id. \n58 Dkt. 77 at 19-23. \n  17 \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 85   Filed 07/28/17   Page 22 of 23\n  Contrary to Defendants’ arguments, there is no state-law exception to the NVRA’s clear \nand unambiguous mandates, and Equal Protection Clause claims involving the right to vote \nrequire Anderson-Burdick analysis. Because Plaintiffs have statutory and Article III standing, \nbecause it is undisputed that online driver’s license transactions do not simultaneously serve as \napplications  for  or  updates  to  voter  registration  in  Texas,  and  because  in  their  own  MSJ, \nPlaintiffs demonstrate Defendants’ violations of the NVRA and the Equal Protection clause, this \nCourt should deny Defendants’ MSJ and grant Plaintiffs’ MSJ. \n \n Dated:  July 28, 2017.

United States, 809 F.3d 134, 150 (5th Cir. 2015). In many cases, a preliminary injunction serves \nto preserve the relative positions of the parties until a trial on the merits can be held. Univ. of Texas v. \nCamenisch, 451 U.S. 390, 395 (1981). Preliminary injunctions that would change, rather than maintain, \nthe status quo are generally disfavored and should not issue unless the facts and law clearly favor the \nmoving party.  Martine< v. Mathews,  544 F.2d 1233, 1243  (5th Cir.  1976). On the other hand, \"[a] \nfundamental principle of preliminary injunctions [is that] [a]n injunction is of no help if one must wait \nto suffer injury before the court grants it.\" Texas v.  U.S., 809 F.3d at 173 n. 137 (citing United States v. \nEmerson, 270 F.3d 203, 262 (5th Cir. 2001)). In this case, maintaining the status quo would mean the \nindividual plaintiffs would remain unregistered and ineligible to vote in the county and precinct where \nthey reside. The Court need not wait for the individual plaintiffs to suffer disenfranchisement before \nconsidering preliminary injunctive relief. Id. Given the limited purpose of a preliminary injunction, and \ngiven the haste that is often necessary in considering the relief being sought, \"a preliminary injunction \nis customarily granted on the basis of procedures that are less formal and evidence that is less complete \n2 \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 156   Filed 01/30/20   Page 3 of 17\n3953 \nthan in a trial on the merits.\" Camenisob, 451 U.S. at  Ultimately, the decision to grant preliminary \ninjunctive relief rests in the sound discretion of the district court, and is \"often dependent as much on \nthe equities of [the] case as the substance of the legal issues it presents.\" Trump v. Int'l Refugee Assistance \n-, -, \nPivject,  U.S.  137 S.Ct. 2080, 2087 (2017). \nII. \nBackground of the case \nIn May 2018, this Court granted declaratory and injunctive relief in favor of Plaintiff Jarrod \nStringer and former plaintiffs Benjamin Hernandez andJohn Woods. The Court found, based on largely \nuncontested  facts,  that Defendants  violated the  National  Voter  Registration Act,  52 U.S.C.  §j \n20503(a)(1), 20504(a), (c), (d), and (e), and 20507(a)(1)(A), and the Equal Protection Clause, U.S. Const. \namend. XW,  1, by failing to permit simukaneous voter registration with online driver's license renewal \nand change-of-address transactions. The Court permanently enjoined Defendants from continuing to \nviolate the NVRA and Equal Protection Clause and ordered them to establish procedures that treat each \nonline driver's license renewal or change-of-address application as a simultaneous application for voter \nregistration which must then be submitted to the Secretary of State. Stringerv. Pablos, 320 F.Supp. 3d 862 \n(W.D. Tex. 2018), rev'd and remanded, Stringer v. W/hitley, 942 F.3d 715 (5th Cir. 2019) (\"Stringer I\"). \nDefendants appealed to the Fifth Circuit, which held that Plaintiffs did not have standing to seek \nprospective injunctive relief because they had not shown a continuing or threatenedfuture injury to their \n31n  fact, the Court may rely upon otherwise inadmissible evidence when considering a preliminary \ninjunction. Sierra Club, Lone Star Chapter v. FDIC, 992 F.2d 545,551(5th Cit. 1993); Tex. CommerceBankNat'lAss'n \nv. State ofF lorida, 1997 WL 181532, at *4 (N.D. Tex. Apr. 9, 1997) (in a preliminary injunction proceeding, \"the \ncourt may rely on hearsay evidence and may even give inadmissible evidence some weight\"), afi'd, 138 F.3d 179 \n(5th Cit. 1998). \n3 \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 156   Filed 01/30/20   Page 4 of 17\nconstitutional right to vote. Chief Judge Owen wrote: \nPlaintiffs contend that they have demonstrated a substantial risk that they will suffer a future \ninjury as a result of the DPS System's noncompliance with the NYRA and Equal Protection \nClause. As Plaintiffs concede, to do so, they must demonstrate \"a sufficient probability that \neach Plaintiff will use the noncompliant driver's license services again.\" All three Plaintiffs \ndeclared that they \"plan to continue transacting online with [DPS] in the future whenever \n[they are] required to renew or change the address on [their] driver's license and [are] eligible \nto do so.\" However, each Plaintiff will have the occasion to use the DPS System to update \nhis voter registration only if (1) he moves within Texas, in which case he might wish use the \nDPS System to change his address on file with DPS and his county voter registrar, or (2) he \nbecomes both unregistered to vote and eligible to renew his driver's license using the DPS \nSystem, in which case he might wish to use the DPS System to renew his driver's license and \nregister to vote. \nPlaintiffs rely on two types of evidence that they contend demonstrate a substantial risk that \nthey will move again. The first is evidence of their prior movesHemandez and Woods \nhave each moved once in the past five years, and Stringer has moved several times. \nHowever, evidence that a plaintiff has taken an action in the past does not, by itself, \ndemonstrate a substantial risk that the plaintiff will take the action in the future; there must \nbe some evidence that the plaintiff intends to take the action again. Accordingly, evidence \nthat Plaintiffs moved in the past does not establish a substantial risk that they will do so in \nthe future. Notab/y, no Plaintiff has expressed aiy intention to move in the future. \nThe second type of evidence cited by Plaintiffs is data from the United States Census Bureau \nshowing that Americans can expect to move 11.7 times in their lifetimes. This general data \nalso does not establish a substantial risk that Plaintiffs themselves will move again; Plaintiff- \nspecific evidence is needed before Plaintiffs' claims can be properly characterized as an \nattempt to remedy an imminent injury to Plaintiffs instead of a generalized grievance \navailable to all Texans. \nPlaintiffs also have not demonstrated a substantial risk that they will attempt to use the DPS \nSystem to renew their driver's licenses and simultaneously update their voter registrations. \nPlaintiffs contend that Texas's requirement that driver's licenses must be renewed every six \nyears and the existence of Texas laws providing multiple avenues for the cancellation of a \nvoter's registration create a \"sufficient probability\" that, at some point in the future, \nPlaintiffs will be both unregistered to vote and eligible to renew their driver's licenses using \nthe DPS System. However, Plaintiffs do not point to any Plaintiff-specific evidence \nsuggesting that they will become unregistered and eligible to renew their driver's licenses \nusing the DPS System. \nIn light of the absence of any Plaintiff-specific evidence, the evidence in the record does not \ndemonstrate a substantial risk that Plaintiffs will become unregistered and eligible to renew \ntheir driver's licenses online. Plaintiffs cite Texas laws that provide for the cancellation of \nvoter registration in four relatively uncommon situations: (1) when a voter's registration card \nis returned as undeliverable, the voter does not return a confirmation notice, and the voter \ndoes not vote in two consecutive general elections; (2) when a registrar fmds a voter to be \nineligible after an investigation; (3) when another voter from the same county successfully \nchallenges a voter's registration; and (4) when a voter cancels his or her voter registration. \n4 \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 156   Filed 01/30/20   Page 5 of 17\nThere is no evidence in the record that suggests that any Plaintiff is likely to fall within the \nambit of these provisions. Furthermore, Texans are only required to renew their driver's \nlicenses every eight years, and every other renewal must be accomplished in person. Chances \nare slim that Plaintiffs will become unregistered around the time that they need to renew \ntheir driver's licenses and are eligible to do so using the DPS System. \nIn sum, Plaintiffs have not established a substantial risk that they will attempt to update their \nvoter registrations using the DPS System and be injured by their inability to do so. As a \nresult, Plaintiffs have not established an injury in fact sufficient to confer standing to pursue \nthe declaratory and injunctive relief that they seek. \nStringer v. W/hitleji, 942 F.3d at 721-23 (emphasis added). \nJudge Ho, concurring, stated: \nI agree with my colleagues that we are not at liberty to decide the merits in this case, because \nnone of these Plaintiffs have standing to seek injunctive relief here. They all secured their \nright to vote by the 2016 election cycle. And they claim no future injury that we can redress \ntoday.. .  . But although we have no occasion to decide the merits of Plaintiffs' claim due to \ntheir lack of a future injury, that does not prevent us from acknowledging that Plaintiffs have \nindeed endured an injury in the past. They were unable to exercise their right to vote in past \nelection cycles. And it is a right they will never be able to recover. As citizens, we can hope it \n- \nis a deprivation they will not experience again  even if the law does not afford them a \nremedy from this court at this time. \nStringer v. W/hitlej, 942 F.3d at 726 (emphasis in original). \nIII. \nFacts giving rise to the current claims \nAlthough the Fifth Circuit found, based on the facts in the record at that time, that Mr. \nStringer had not proven he would likely sustain another injury in the future, it has happened again. \nBefore November 23, 2019, Mr. Stringer moved from a residence in Bexar County to a new \nresidence in Harris County. On November 23, 2019, Mr. Stringer had his wife visit the DPS website \nto change the address on his driver's license. He would have also had his wife update his voter \nregistration online when updating his driver's license, but was not given the option. Thus, he \nremains registered at his old address in Bexar County. If his registration is not updated before \nFebruary 3, 2020, he will not be able to vote in the March 2020 primary election in the county and \nprecinct where he resides. Mr. Stringer also states, in his uncontested sworn declaration, that he \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 156   Filed 01/30/20   Page 6 of 17\nplans to move residences again in 2020. Specifically, he and his wife plan to move out of their \ncurrent rental apartment and into a new residence by August 25, 2020 at the latest. Docket no. 5-1, \nAppx. 178-180. \nCo-plaintiff John Harms, who was not a plaintiff in Stringer I, was a resident of Bastrop \nCounty prior to July 2019. At that time, he was registered to vote and did vote in Bastrop County. In \nmid-July 2019, Mr. Harms moved from Bastrop County to Travis County, where he signed a one- \nyear lease on a house. On or about October 8, 2019, he visited the DPS online system and \ncompleted the process to change the address on his driver's license to his new residence in Travis \nCounty. If he had been provided the option to simultaneously update his voter registration, he \nwould have done so. He was not provided that option, and he remains unregistered at this time to \nvote in Travis County. If Mr. Harms' voter registration is not updated before February 3, 2020, he \nwill not be able to vote in the March 2020 primary election. Mr. Harms' sworn declaration is also \nuncontested. Docket no. 5-1, Appx. 182-183. \nCo-plaintiff Nayeli Gomez, who was not a plaintiff in Stringer I, moved from one residence \nin Bexar County to a new residence in Bexar County in the Summer of 2019. On December 9, 2019, \nshe visited the DPS online system to change the address on her driver's license to her new address \nbut she was unable to simultaneously update her voter registration. She would have simultaneously \nupdated her voter registration if she had been given the option, but she was not given that option. \nShe remains registered at her old address and will not be able to vote in her home precinct in the \nMarch 2020 primary election if her registration is not updated before February 3, 2020. Docket no. \n5-1, Appx. 185-1 86. \nCurrent and former plaintiff Jarrod Stringer, along with current plaintiffs Nayeli Gomez, \nJohn Harms, MOVE Texas Civil Fund, and League of Women Voters of Texas and Intervenor- \nplaintiffs Texas Democratic Party, DCCC, and DSCC, now assert the same causes of action at issue \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 156   Filed 01/30/20   Page 7 of 17\nin Stringer I because Defendants have not changed their practices and new violations have occurred, \ni; \nresulting in a continuing injury and/or threatened future injury. Docket no.  Docket no. 137. \nIv. \nThe scope of relief currently being considered \nPlaintiffs' Emergency Application for Preliminary Injunction was filed three days after the \nfiling of Plaintiffs' original complaint. After filing their motion, Plaintiffs significantly narrowed the \ntemporary injunctive relief they are seeking. Within that scope of relief, the continuing injury and/or \nthreatened future injury suffered by the individual plaintiffs is the most urgent, given the February 3 \ndeadline for Texans to register to vote and/or update their voter registration. The temporary \ninjunctive relief sought by these individuals should also be easily redressable before the February 3 \ndeadline. Thus, due to strict time restraints, the Court is currently considering only the very narrow \ntemporary relief sought by the three individuals plaintiffs. The remaining relief sought in the \nEmergency Application for Preliminary Injunction has been taken under advisement, but is held in \nabeyance at this time. \nV. \nStanding to seek temporary injunctive relief \nand substantial likelihood of success on the merits \nA.  What Plaintiffs must show to have standing \nIn Stringer I, the Fifth Circuit set forth the applicable standard for determining whether the \nindividual plaintiffs have Article III standing: \nTo have Article III standing, a plaintiff must show an injury in fact that is fairly traceable to \nthe challenged action of the defendant and likely to be redressed by the plaintiff's requested \nrelief. Courts have divided this rule into three components: injury in fact, causation, and \nredressability. The party seeking to invoke federal jurisdiction, in this case the Plaintiffs, \nbears the burden of establishing all three elements. \n4Docketed in 20-CV-46. \n7 \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 156   Filed 01/30/20   Page 8 of 17\nRequests for injunctive [] relief implicate the intersection of the redressability and injury-in- \nfact requirements. The redressability requirement limits the relief that a plaintiff may seek to \nthat which is likely to remedy the plaintiffs alleged injuries. Because injunctive  relief \n[  ] \n\"cannot conceivably remedy any past wrong,\" plaintiffs seeking injunctive  relief can \n[  ] \nsatisfy the redressability requirement only by demonstrating a continuing injury or threatened \nfuture injury. That continuing or threatened future injury, like all injuries supporting Article \nIII standing, must be an injury in fact. To be an injury in fact, a threatened future injury must \nbe (1) potentially suffered by the plaintiff not someone else; (2) \"concrete and \nparticularized,\" not abstract; and (3) \"actual or imminent, not 'conjectural' or 'hypothetical.\" \nThe purpose of the requirement that the injury be \"itnniinent\" is \"to ensure that the alleged \ninjury is not too speculative for Article III purposes.\" For a threatened future injury to \nsatisfy the imminence requirement, there must be at least a \"substantial risk\" that the injury \nwill occur. \nStringer v. Whitley, 942 F.3d at 720-21 (internal citations omitted). \nB. The challenged action \nThe challenged action in question is Defendants' violation of the National Voter \nRegistration Act (N\\TRA), 52 U.S.C. § 20501, et. seq. and the Equal Protection clause, U.S. const. \namend. XW,  1. For purposes of seeking temporary injunctive relief, Plaintiffs Jarrod Stringer and \n§ \nNayeli Gomez seek relief under both the NVRA and the Fourteenth Amendment. Mr. Harms \nasserts his right to temporary injunctive relief under an Equal Protection claim only. \nIt is undisputed that on the dates in question, Stringer and Gomez were denied the right to \nsimultaneously update their voter registration when they updated the address on their drivers license \nthrough DPS' online procedure. This is a violation of the NVRA, 52 U.S.C.  20503(a)(1) \n§ \n(\"notwithstanding any other Federal or State law, in addition to any other method of voter \nregistration provided for under State law, each State shall establish procedures to register to vote in \n- \nelections for Federal office  (1) by application made simuitaneons/y with an application for a motor \nvehicle driver's license\"). It is undisputed that on the dates in question the applications completed by \nStringer and Gomez for updating their driver's license did not serve as applications for voter \nregistration. This is a violation of the NYRA, 52 U.S.C.  20504(a) (1),(2) (\"Each State motor vehicle \n§ \ndriver's license application (including any renewal application) submitted to the appropriate State \n8 \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 156   Filed 01/30/20   Page 9 of 17\nmotor vehicle authority under State law shall serve as an application for voter registration.\"). It is \nundisputed that the DPS form completed by Stringer and Gomez does not include voter registration \nas part thereof; and registering to vote elsewhere would require information that duplicates \ninformation provided in the DPS driver's license form. This is a violation of the NVRA, 52 U.S.C. \n20504(c) (1),(2), and (d) (\"Each State shall include a voter registration application form for elections \nfor Federal office as part of an application for a State motor vehicle driver's license  The voter \n- \nregistration applicationportion of an application for a State motor vehicle driver's license  ma  not \nrequire anji information that duplicates information required in the driver'c license portion oft he form. .  .

At the hearing, Defendants suggested that Plaintiffs can just \ngo somewhere else to update their registration by February 3. The mandates of the NVRA dictate \nexactly the opposite of what Defendants now suggest Plaintiffs should do to avoid being \ndisenfranchised on March 3: engage in a second transaction with another agency, which requires a \nseparate application with duplicate information and the burden of mail, postage, and/or personal \ndelivery. Congress lifted these burdens to make voter registration easier, not more confusing and \ndifficult.6 \nDefendants essentially claim that when it comes to online services they cannot comply with \nthe NYRA because it conflicts with state law. The Court previously addressed this asserted \njustification in Stringer I, which the Fifth Circuit did not reach. Thus, the Court has re-visited the \nissue and reaches the same conclusion.7 First, the provisions of the NVRA neither incorporate Texas \nelection law nor make it subject thereto.8 Second, Texas election law cannot be used as an excuse for \n52 U.S.C.  20510(b)(2)-(3). \n6The Court also notes that Mr. Stringer is reportedly chronically ill. Docket no. 10 (docketed in \n20-CV-46). Again,  the NVRA was intended to remove barriers that make voter registration more \nrestrictive or inconvenient for all voters, but this is especially important for voters like Mr. Stringer. 52 \nU.S.0  20506(a)(5)(C) states that agencies designated to provide voter registration services shall not. \n\"take any action the purpose or effect of which is to discourage the applicant from registering to \nvote.\" DPS and SOS cannot simply tell Texans to go somewhere else to register to vote. \n7Because time is of the essence, the Court's written analysis to determine \"likelihood of success\" \nat this juncture is necessarily less extensive than the merits analysis in 2018. However, the parties have \nagreed that neither the law nor Defendants' practices have changed since the Court's merits analysis in \n2018. \n8just briefly, in 52 U.S.C.  20504(a) (1) and (d), for example, the reference to state law means \nthe driver's license laws (i.e. the Texas Transportation Code). The NVRA was enacted under the Elections \nclause, U.S. Const. Art. I  4, ci. 1, which gives Congress the broad power to preempt, alter, and supplant state \n§ \nlaw when it comes to federal voter registration practices. Arizona ii. InterTribal County ofAri<ona, Inc., 570 U.S. 1, \n133 S. Ct. 2247, 2253-57 (2013). (\"The Clause's substantive scope is broad\" and \"Elections Clause legislation, \nso far as it extends and conflicts with the regulations of the State, necessarily supersedes them\"). To the extent \nstate voter registration procedures are inconsistent with the NVRA, they are superseded. Id. at 2253-54 (\"the state \n'Eli \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 156   Filed 01/30/20   Page 11 of 17\nfailing to comply with the NVRA. To the extent it is inconsistent with the NYRA, Texas election \nlaw must yield to the NVRA.9 And third, there in nothing in either the NYRA or state law that \nprecludes the use of electronic signatures in online driver's license-voter registration transactions. It \nis undisputed that the State of Texas already has preexisting electronically stored signatures for every \nperson that uses the online service, and could use them for both driver's license and voter \nregistration. Defendants already use electronically stored signatures for every in-person and mail \ndriver's license-voter registration transaction, which makes their refusal to accept them in online \ntransactions unexplainable.10 \nTo be clear, the NYRA does not require DPS to offer online driver's license transactions, \nbut DPS has made the choice to utilize and promote such a process. Having made this choice, and \nbecause the NVRA covers all driver's license applications, renewals, and change of address \nlaw, so far as the conflict extends, ceases to be operative\"). On the other hand, the NYRA does not supplant \nstate driver's license laws. Thus, interpreting the provisions in 52 U.S.C.  20504(a)(1) and (d) to mean that \n§ \ndriver's license applications submitted in accordance with the Texas Transportation Code shall also serve as \napplications for voter registration purposes is consistent with the purpose of the Act and the entire statutory \nscheme. \n9See n. 8. \n101t is worth noting that with twenty-first century technology and legislation such as the Global and \nNational Commerce Act (E-Sign Act) and Uniform Electronic Transactions Act (UETA), electronic signatures \nare legally recognized and widely used. 15 U.S.C.  7001 et. seq.; Unif. Electronic Transactions Act, U.L.A. (1999). \n§ \nUnder the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act, which has been adopted by Texas and 46 other states, the \nmedium in which a signature is created, presented or retained does not affect its legal significance. See UETA § \n7; Tex. Bus. & Corn. Code Ann.  322.007(a),(c),(d) (Vernon 2015) (TUETA). As these provisions explain: a \n§ \nrecord or signature may not be denied legal effect or enforceability solely because it is in electronic form; if a law \nrequires a record to be in writing, an electronic record satisfies the law; if a law requires a signature, an electronic \nsignature satisfies the law. Texas law permits SOS and DPS to accept electronic records and electronic signatures. \nSee Tex. Bus. & Corn. Code § 322.017 (each state agency has  the option to accept electronic records and \nelectronic signatures); Tex. Bus. & Corn. Code  322.007 (\"If a law requires a signature, an electronic signature \n§ \nsatisfies the law.\"); see also Tex. Bus. & Corn. Code § 322.008(a) (\"If parties have agreed to conduct a transaction \nby electronic means and a law requires a person to provide, send, or deliver information in writing to another \nperson, the requirement is satisfied if the information is provided, sent, or delivered, as the case may be, in an \nelectronic record .  .  .\"); Tex. Bus. & Com. Code § 322.012 (\"if a law requires that a record be retained, the \nrequirement is satisfied by retaining an electronic record\"); Tex. Govt Code  2054.060 (\"digital signature may \n§ \nbe used to authenticate a written electronic communication sent to a state agency\"); I Tex. Admin. Code  203.24 \n§ \n(describing technology that may be acceptable for use by state agencies). \n11 \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 156   Filed 01/30/20   Page 12 of 17\ntransactions, the online change of address transactions must be treated no differently than the in- \nperson and mail transactions. See 52 U.S.C. § 20504(a)(1) (\"Each State motor vehicle driver's \napplication.  .\"). Defendants have offered no viable defense to the statutory violations in question \n. \nor their continued refusal to comply with the NYRA. Based on the facts currently before the court, \nthere is a substantial likelihood that Plaintiffs Stringer and Gomez will succeed on the merits of their \nNVRA claims. \nPlaintiffs Stringer, Gomez, and Harms also assert that Defendants' refusal to provide voter \nregistration applications simultaneously with online driver's license transactions constitutes a \nviolation of their Equal Protection rights under the Fourteenth Amendment)' The right to vote is a \nfundamental right protected under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. \nHarperu.  Va. State Bd. ofE  lections, 383 U.S. 663, 670 (1966). \"The right to vote is protected in more \nthan the initial allocation of the franchise. Equal protection applies as well to the manner of its \nexercise.\" Bush v. Gore, 531 U.S. 98, 104 (2000) (per curiam). The Equal Protection Clause applies \nwhen state procedures restrict voters' rights. Bush v. Gore, 531 U.S. at 103 (Supreme Court found that \nFlorida's failure to institute reliable recount procedures violated the Equal Protection Clause); Obama \nforAm. v. Husted, 697 F.3d 423, 436-37 (6th Cir. 2012)  (Circuit court found that Ohio law that \nprevented casting of early ballots by non-military voters violated the Equal Protection Clause). The \nAnderson-B urdick standard will apply herein. Burdicle v. Tukushi, 504 U.S. 428 (1992).12  Under this \n11\"The rights and remedies established by [the NVRA] are in addition to all other rights and \nremedies provided by law.\" 52 U.S.C.  20510(d) (1). \n§ \n'2See VotinsforAm., Inc. v. Steen, 732 F.3d 382 (5th Cir. 2013) (Fifth Circuit applied Anderson- \nBurdick analysis in challenge to state law regulating volunteer deputy registrars); Tex. Democratic Party v. \nWilliams, 285 Fed. Appx. 194, 195 (5th Cir. 2008)  (per curiam)  (noting that district court properly \napplied Anderson-Burdick balancing test to the constitutional claims challenging use of eSlate voting \nmachines), cert. denied, 555 U.S. 1100 (2009); Faas v. Cascos, 225 F. Supp. 3d 604, 610 (S.D. Tex. 2016) \n(State election laws \"could hardly serve their legitimate purposes if they were routinely subject to strict \nscrutiny... [thus], [t]he United States Supreme Court recognized the need for a more flexible analytical \n12 \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 156   Filed 01/30/20   Page 13 of 17\nstandard, \"[a] court considering a challenge to a state election law must weigh the character and \nmagnitude of the asserted injury to the rights protected by the [Constitution] that the plaintiff seeks \nto vindicate against the precise interests put forward by the State as justification for the burden \nimposed by its rule, taking into consideration the extent to which those interests make it necessary \nto burden the plaintiff's rights.\" Burdick, 504 U.S. at 434 (internal quotes omitted). \"However slight \nthe burden [to the voters] may appear,.  it must be justified by relevant and legitimate state \n.  . \ninterests sufficiently weighty to justify the limitation.\" Crawford v. Marion Cry. Elec. Bd., 553 U.S. 181, \n191 (2008). \n\"{V]oting is of the most fundamental significance under our constitutional structure,\" \nBurdick, 504 U.S. at 433, and unfair registration procedures can have a direct and damaging effect on \nvoter participation. See 52 U.S.C.  20501(a)(3) (Congressional findings). While the State can impose \nreasonable restrictions, those restrictions must be justified by specific interests that outweigh the \nburden on voters. It is undisputed that Defendants permit simultaneous voter applications for \npersons who renew or change their driver's license in person or by mail, but refuse simultaneous \nvoter applications for persons who renew or change their driver's license online. Persons who renew \nor change their driver's license in person or by mail need only check a single box indicating that he/she \nwould like to register or update his/her voter information. After checking the box on the driver's license \nform, rio further steps are necessary. DPS sends the updated information to SOS in nightly batches, so the \nvoter registration is updated timely and efficiently. However, persons who renew or change their driver's \nlicense online are denied the same process. They first go through the steps to renew or change the address \non their license online, then must end their DPS driver's license transaction before going to SOS to obtain, \nprint, and complete a separate voter registration application which requires duplicate information. Once the \nframework in two landmark cases: Anderson and Burdick\"). \n13 \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 156   Filed 01/30/20   Page 14 of 17\nadditional application is complete, it must be mailed or hand delivered. DPS, a voter registration agency, \nmaintains a procedure that accepts simultaneous voter registration applications for some, while rejecting \nthem for others. This type of restriction on voter registration imposes a burden on the fundamental right to \nvote that warrants the demonstration of a corresponding interest sufficiently weighty to justify the limitation. \nAgain, Defendants' only justification for the voter registration burden imposed these voters is the \n\"signature\" requirement under Texas election law. However, neither federal nor state law limits the signature \nrequirement to physical hand written signatures on paper (or \"wet\" signatures). Electronic signatures and \nelectronic records are legally recognized and widely used, and Defendants offer no reason for refusing to \naccept them for online transactions. DPS already uses electronic records and previously imaged electronic \nsignatures for every Texan that uses the online system for driver's license renewal or change of address. And \nthe Secretary of State already uses electronic records and previously imaged electronic signatures for voter \nregistration purposes. There is no reason why Defendants cannot use them in an online driver's license-voter \nregistration transaction when it already uses them in mail and in-person transactions. \nNeither the law nor the facts support Defendants' alleged justification for limiting simultaneous \nvoter applications to in-person and mail transactions and refusing simultaneous voter applications for \npersons that renew or change their driver's license online. Because the alleged justification is not legitimate, \nthere is no state interest that outweighs the burden imposed on voters. Defendants fail to demonstrate a \ncorresponding interest sufficiently weighty to justify the limitation on voters' rights. \nBased on the facts currently before the Court, there is a substantial likelihood that Plaintiffs \nStringer, Gomez, and Harms will succeed on the merits of their Equal Protection claims. \nVI. \nInjury in fact, causation, redressability. and irreparable harm \nIt is undisputed that Plaintiffs Stringer, Gomez, and Harms were not simultaneously \nregistered to vote (i.e., their voter registration was not updated) at the time of their online \n14 \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 156   Filed 01/30/20   Page 15 of 17\ntransactions with DPS, a designated voter registration agency. It is undisputed that they are still \nunregistered to vote and will be disenfranchised on March 3 if they are not registered to vote by the \n- \ndeadline  February 3. This continuing injury (lack of voter registration as a result of Defendants' \nunlawful procedure) and threatened future injury (disenfranchisement) more than satisfies the \nstanding necessary for injunctive relief. See Stringer v. W/hitleji, 942 F.3d at 720 (\"plaintiffs seeking \ninjunctive  relief can satisfy the redressability requirement only by demonstrating a continuing \n[ ] \ninjury or threatened future injury.\"). The Plaintiffs' continuing and threatened future injury will be \n(1) potentially suffered by these plaintiffs, not someone else; (2) \"concrete and particularized,\" not \nabstract; and (3) \"actual or imminent, not 'conjectural' ot 'hypothetical.' \"Id. at 720-21. With the \ndeadline for voter registration in just a few days, and the primary election thirty days thereafter, there \nis a \"substantial risk\" that the individual plaintiffs will be disenfranchised if they are not registered to \nvote; thus, threatened future injury is indisputably \"imminent.\" Moreover, Plaintiffs' continuing and \nfuture threatened injury is \"fairly traceable\" to the challenged action of Defendants. But for \nDefendants failure to comply with the NVRA, and the unjustified burden on Plaintiffs' \nconstitutional rights, Plaintiffs would already be registered to vote in the county and precinct where \nthey reside. \n- \nThe future injury  disenfranchisement  is irreparable. The right to vote is a fundamental \nright, and the deprivation of such right is something Plaintiffs \"wifi never be able to recover.\" Stringer \nv. Whitlej, 942 F.3d at 726. (Ho, J., concurring). But the injury that will occur between now and \nMarch 3 is still redressable with immediate, temporary injunctive relief. These individual plaintiffs \nshould not be forced to wait and suffer a constitutional deprivation when it can be avoided by \ngranting temporary injunctive relief. Texas v.  U.S., 809 F.3d at 173 n. 137 (citing United States v. \nEmerson, 270 F.3d 203, 262 (5th Cir. 2001)). \n15 \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 156   Filed 01/30/20   Page 16 of 17\nVII. \nBalance of harm and public interest \n- \nThe harm to the individual plaintiffs  being disenfranchised  clearly outweighs the minimal \nburden, if any, that will be placed on Defendants by simply being ordered to perform their duties \nand take the necessary steps to ensure that these three individuals are registered to vote. The public \nclearly has a paramount interest in removing voter registration barriers and having procedures that \nencourage rather than discourage voter registration. Defendants have offered no factual or legal \nargument that would justify denying the simultaneous voter registration to which these individual \nplaintiffs are entitled. \nVIII. \nTemporary relief being ordered \nThe temporary relief being ordered herein is narrowly tailored, and the Court orders no \nmore than what the law clearly and unequivocally requires of Defendants. There is an expectation, \nunder the notice provisions of the NVRA, that if a designated voter registration agency such as DPS \n- \nviolates the NVRA, the chief election official of the State  upon notification  will correct the \nviolation.13 That is all the Court is ordering herein. Compliance with this order will ensure that the \nindividual plaintiffs herein will not be forced to suffer a continuing or threatened future injury. \nFor the reasons stated herein, which are based on a preliminary review, the Court \nORDERS that pursuant to 52 U.S.C.  20504(d), the last change of address forms submitted \n§ \nby the individual plaintiffs for purposes of updating the address on their driver's license \n\"shall serve as notification of change of address for voter registration with respect to \n13To be clear, Defendants could have avoided this type of emergency relief by simply agreeing to assist \nplaintiffs in getting their voter registration updated  a duty and obligation they already have under the law. \n16 \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 156   Filed 01/30/20   Page 17 of 17\nelections for Federal offlce for the registrant involved.\" Defendant DPS must immediately \nsubmit the information contained in the previously completed forms, along with the \nindividual plaintiffs stored electronic signatures, as necessary, to the Texas Secretary of \nState.14 The Secretary of State will then immediately submit the same information to the \ncorrect county voter registrars, along with a copy of this injunction order and written \ninstructions to immediately register these individual plaintiffs to vote. The Secretary of State \nmust confirm that all three individual plaintiffs are registered tovote before the deadline to \nregister to vote so they may participate in the upcoming primary elections. When that \nconfirmation is received, Defendants must file a written advisory with the Court no later \nthan 2:00 p.m. on February 3 confirming that all three individual plaintiffs are timely \nregistered to vote in the county and precinct in which they reside. If Defendants must \ndesignate one or more employees, agents, or representatives to carry out this order, they are \nexpected to do so. \nThe Emergency Application for Preliminary Injunction is GRANTED in part, and the rest \nof the preliminary injunctive relief being sought is held in abeyance. \n/ \nSIGNED and ENTERED this  day of January, 2020 at  o'clock  [. m.. \nORLANDO L. GARCIA \nCHIEF U.S. DISTRICT JUDGE \n141n other words, DPS and SOS will treat it the same way they would treat an in-person or mail- \nin change of address form and follow generally the same submission process set forth in 52 U.S.C. \n20504(e)(2),  but on an expedited basis so that completion of voter registration occurs before the \ndeadline. \n17 ",

Stringer I was litigated to final judgment in this Court. On appeal from that \nfinal  judgment,  the  Fifth  Circuit  held  that  this  Court  lacked  subject  matter \n                                            \n1 The Court is familiar with the factual background, so Defendants do not reiterate it here. \n1 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 167   Filed 02/11/20   Page 2 of 21\njurisdiction and remanded with instructions to dismiss for lack of standing. Stringer \nv. Whitley, 942 F.3d 715, 725 (5th Cir. 2019). After remand, the Democratic Party \nIntervenors moved to intervene in Stringer I. Dkt. 124. Defendants opposed that \nintervention. Dkt. 133. On January 21, 2020, this Court sua sponte consolidated \nStringer I and Stringer II, Dkt. 135, and granted the Motion to Intervene that the \nDemocratic Party Intervenors filed in Stringer I. Dkt. 136. This Court then dismissed \nthe Stringer I Plaintiffs’ claims from the newly consolidated case. Dkt. 139. \nThe Democratic Party Intervenors allege that Texas “arbitrarily subject[s] \neligible voters to disparate voter registration standards” and has “denied voters an \nequal opportunity to participate in federal and state elections in violation of Section \n1 of the Fourteenth Amendment.” Dkt. 137, ¶ 33. They further allege that, “[a]s a \nresult of this disparate treatment, Intervenor-Plaintiffs were directly harmed in their \nmission to elect Democratic representatives, and those among their membership \nharmed  through  disenfranchisement.”  Id.  The  cause  of  these  alleged  harms, \naccording  to  Plaintiffs,  is  Texas’s  written-signature  requirement  for  voter-\nregistration applications and changes to voter-registration addresses. \nARGUMENT AND AUTHORITY \n  The Democratic Party Intervenors’ complaint should be dismissed for lack of \njurisdiction  because  the  Court  did  not  have  authority  to  grant  the  motion  to \nintervene, and because the Intervenors fail to allege injury-in-fact to themselves or \nto their members. They also lack statutory standing to bring an equal protection \nclaim. Even if they had standing, the Democratic Party Intervenors’ claim fails on the \n2 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 167   Filed 02/11/20   Page 3 of 21\nmerits  because  they  allege  neither  a  discriminatory  intent  nor  effect  on  an \nidentifiable  political  group,  and  because  Texas’s  written-signature  requirement \napplies equally to all voters.  \nI.  The Democratic Party Intervenors should be dismissed under Rule \n12(b)(1) for lack of jurisdiction. \n \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) governs motions to dismiss for lack of \nsubject-matter jurisdiction. E.g., Hooks v. Landmark Indus., Inc., 797 F.3d 309, 312 \n(5th  Cir.  2015)).  “Subject-matter  jurisdiction”  refers  to  “the  courts’  statutory  or \nconstitutional power to adjudicate the case.” Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env’t, \n523 U.S. 83, 89 (1998). Subject-matter jurisdiction is “a threshold issue that must be \nresolved before any federal court reaches the merits of the case before it.” Perez v. \nU.S., 312 F.3d 191, 194 (5th Cir. 2002); Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env’t, 523 \nU.S. at 94-95. \nA. The  Court  lacked  jurisdiction  to  allow  the  Democratic  Party \nIntervenors to intervene in Stringer I. \n \nAs explained in Defendants’ Response in Opposition to the Motion to Intervene, \nDkt. 133,2 once the Court of Appeals declared Stringer I jurisdictionally defective, \nthere  ceased  to  be  an  existing  suit  within  this  Court’s  jurisdiction  in  which  to \nintervene. Instead, Stringer I should have been dismissed and closed by this Court. \nIt is well-settled that “[a]n existing suit within the court’s jurisdiction is a \nprerequisite of an intervention.” Kendrick v. Kendrick, 16 F.2d 744, 745 (5th Cir. \n1926), cert. denied, 273 U.S. 758 (1927) (denying intervention where court did not \n                                            \n2 Defendants re-urge and incorporate by reference Dkt. 133 as if fully set forth herein. \n3 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 167   Filed 02/11/20   Page 4 of 21\nhave jurisdiction over original lawsuit for lack of indispensable parties). Thus, “a \nperson  may  not  intervene  if  the  original,  underlying  case  was  jurisdictionally \ndefective.” Odle v. Flores, 899 F.3d 344, 348 (5th Cir. 2017) (citing Non Commissioned \nOfficers Ass’n v. Army Times Publ’g Co., 637 F.2d 372, 373 (5th Cir. 1981)); see also \nid. (“‘[T]here is no right . . . to intervene in a [jurisdictionally] defective suit.’”) \n(quoting Truvillion v. King’s Daughters Hosp., 614 F.2d 520, 526 (5th Cir. 1980)). \nWhether there is an existing suit within the court’s jurisdiction is assessed \nbased upon “when the motion to intervene was filed.” Krim v. PCOrder.com, 402 F.3d \n489, 502 (5th Cir. 2005); see also id. (“The ‘prerequisite of an intervention’ that there \nbe ‘an existing suit within the Court’s jurisdiction’ depends here on the individual \nclaims. That none of the individual claims remained viable . . . when the motion to \nintervene was filed, disposes of the attempt at intervention.”) (quoting Army Times \nPubl’g Co., 637 F.2d at 373). \nWhen the Court of Appeals issued its mandate on December 5, 2019, there \nceased to be “an existing suit within the Court’s jurisdiction” because—at that point— \n“none of the individual claims” upon which Plaintiffs invoked this Court’s jurisdiction \n“remained  viable.”  E.g.,  Krim,  402  F.3d  at  502;  see  also,  e.g.,  Ericsson  Inc.  v. \nInterDigital Commc’ns Corp., 418 F.3d 1217, 1222 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (rejecting the \nargument that—because  the district court retained jurisdiction to entertain a motion \nfor relief from final judgment under Rule 60(b)—there was “an existing suit within \nthe court’s jurisdiction” for purposes of intervention) (citing Kendrick, 16 F.2d at 745). \n4 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 167   Filed 02/11/20   Page 5 of 21\nThus, this Court lacked jurisdiction to grant the Motion to Intervene—both as \na jurisdictional matter and in accordance with the mandate rule. “Jurisdiction is \npower to declare the law, and when it ceases to exist, the only function remaining to \nthe court is that of announcing the fact and dismissing the cause.” Steel Co. v. Citizens \nfor a Better Env’t, 523 U.S. at 94 (quoting Ex parte McCardle, 74 U.S. 506, 514 (1868)). \n“Compliance with an order to relinquish jurisdiction necessarily precludes the lower \ncourt from taking any further action other than dismissal, for to do so would involve \nretaining jurisdiction.” Stamper v. Baskerville, 724 F.2d 1106, 1108 (4th Cir. 1984). \nAs the Fifth Circuit has explained, “[t]he mandate rule requires a district court on \nremand to effect our mandate and to do nothing else.” Gen. Universal Sys., Inc. v. \nHAL, Inc., 500 F.3d 444, 453 (5th Cir. 2007).  \nThe Democratic Party Intervenors’ claims should be dismissed because this \nCourt lacked jurisdiction to grant the motion to intervene. \nB. The Democratic Party Intervenors lack standing. \n \nEven  if  the  Court  had  jurisdiction  to  grant  the  Motion  to  Intervene,  the \nDemocratic Party Intervenors fail to allege facts which, if true, would establish their \nstanding. “[S]tanding is perhaps the most important of the jurisdictional doctrines.” \nFW/PBS, Inc. v. City of Dallas, 493 U.S. 215, 231 (1990) (internal quotation omitted). \nTo establish Article III standing, a plaintiff must show: (1) an actual or imminent, \nconcrete  and  particularized  “injury-in-fact”;  (2)  that  is  fairly  traceable  to  the \nchallenged action of the defendant (causation); and (3) that is likely to be redressed \nby a favorable decision (redressability). Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Envt’l. \n5 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 167   Filed 02/11/20   Page 6 of 21\nServs.  (TOC),  Inc.,  528  U.S.  167,  180-81  (2000).  All  three  elements  are  “an \nindispensable part of the plaintiff’s case” and each plaintiff bears the burden to \nestablish them. E.g., Lujan v. Defs. of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 561 (1992). \nThe Democratic Party Intervenors lack organizational standing because they \nhave not plead injury-in-fact. They similarly and lack associational standing to sue \non behalf of their members because they have not alleged injury-in-fact to individuals \namong their membership, because they have not identified an interest germane to \ntheir purpose, and because the claim asserted requires the participation of individual \nmembers. Moreover, even if they had Article III standing, the Democratic Party \nIntervenors’ case should still be dismissed because they lack statutory standing. \n1.  Organizational Standing \n \nAn  organization  has  standing  to  sue  if  it  satisfies  the  same  Article  III \nrequirements  of  injury-in-fact,  causation,  and  redressability  applicable  to \nindividuals. NAACP v. City of Kyle, Tex., 626 F.3d 233, 237 (5th Cir. 2010) (citing \nLujan, 504 U.S. at 560-61). “[A]n organization may establish injury in fact by showing \nthat it had diverted significant resources to counteract the defendant’s conduct; \nhence,  the  defendant’s  conduct  significantly  and  ‘perceptibly  impaired’  the \norganization’s ability to” conduct its routine “‘activities—with the consequent drain \non the organization’s resources[.]’” Id. (quoting Havens Realty Corp. v. Coleman, 455 \nU.S. 363, 379 (1982)). “Not every diversion of resources to counteract [a] defendant’s \nconduct, however, establishes an injury in fact.” Id. at 238. Rather, any “[s]uch injury \nmust be ‘concrete and demonstrable.’” Id. \n6 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 167   Filed 02/11/20   Page 7 of 21\nThus, to establish standing, “an organizational plaintiff must explain how the \nactivities it undertakes in response to the defendant’s conduct differ from its ‘routine \n[] activities,’” and must “identify ‘specific projects that [it] had to put on hold or \notherwise curtail in order to respond to’ the defendant’s conduct.” Def. Distributed v. \nUnited States Dep’t of State, No. 1:15-CV-372-RP, 2018 WL 3614221, at *4 (W.D. Tex. \nJuly 27, 2018) (quoting City of Kyle, 626 F.3d at 238). See also, e.g., ACORN v. Fowler, \n178 F.3d 350, 358 (5th Cir. 1999) (holding that organization’s expenditures must be \n“caused by an[] action by” the defendant that the organization “claims is illegal, as \nopposed to part of the normal, day-to-day operations of the group” to confer standing) \n(citing Fair Hous. Council of Suburban Philadelphia v. Montgomery Newspapers, 141 \nF.3d 71, 78 & n.5 (3d Cir. 1998)).3 \nThe Democratic Party Intervenors do not meet this standard. TDP alleges that  \n•  it “is the statewide organization representing Democratic candidates \nand voters throughout the State of Texas within the meaning of Section \n117 of Texas’s Election Code;”4 \n \n•  its “purpose is to elect Democratic Party candidates to public office \nthroughout Texas;” and \n \n•  its  activities  “include[]  supporting  Democratic  Party  candidates  in \nnational, state, and local elections through fundraising and organizing; \nprotecting the legal rights of voters; and ensuring that all voters have a \nmeaningful ability to cast ballots in Texas.” \n \nDkt. 137, ¶11.  \n                                            \n3 See also, e.g., Advocacy Ctr. v. La. Tech Univ., No. CV 18-0934, 2019 WL 1303212, at *4 (W.D. La. \nMar. 6, 2019) (“[A]lthough an organization conceivably could have standing if it incurred [] costs [], the \norganization still must show that it would not have incurred these costs in the absence of defendant’s \nillegal conduct.”), report and recommendation adopted, 2019 WL 1301983 (W.D. La. Mar. 21, 2019) \n(citing Fowler, 178 F.3d at 357-58). \n4 Texas’s Election Code does not contain any “Section 117.” Accord, TEX. ELEC. CODE § 1.001, et seq. \n7 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 167   Filed 02/11/20   Page 8 of 21\nDSCC, for its part, asserts that \n•  it “is the national senatorial committee of the Democratic Party, as \ndefined by 52 U.S.C. § 30101(14);” \n \n•  its mission is “to elect candidates of the Democratic Party to the United \nStates Senate, including in Texas;” \n \n•  its activities include “assisting state parties throughout the country, \nincluding in Texas;” \n \n•  in 2020, it “expects to invest millions in support of the Democratic \ncandidate selected as the nominee to run against Republican Senator \nJohn Cornyn;” \n \n•  “Texas’s conduct directly harms DSCC by frustrating its mission of, and \nefforts in, electing the Democratic Party candidate to the U.S. Senate in \nTexas  by  suppressing  the  access  of  eligible  Texas  citizens  to  the \nfranchise;”  \n \n•  it “is aware of Texas’s online portal system and will have to expend and \ndivert additional funds and resources on ensuring that eligible citizens \nare not misled into believing that they have effectively registered to vote, \nand are in fact registered to vote, as well as to support GOTV, voter \npersuasion efforts, and other activities in Texas, at the expense of its \nother efforts to defeat Senator Cornyn, as well as its efforts in other \nstates, to combat the effects of Texas’s conduct.”5 \n \nDkt.  137,  ¶12.  DCCC  makes  essentially  the  same  allegations  with  respect  to \nCongressional (as opposed to Senatorial) races. Dkt. 137, ¶13. \n  Even if these allegations were true, they do not state that any Democratic \nParty  Intervenor  “diverted  significant  resources  to  counteract  the  defendant’s \nconduct” such that any “defendant’s conduct significantly and ‘perceptibly impaired’ \nthe organization’s ability to” conduct its routine “‘activities—with the consequent \n                                            \n5 It is unclear what is meant by “Texas’s online portal system,” but for purposes of this motion, \nDefendants assume the phrase refers to the process for renewing or changing the address on a Texas \ndriver license online. \n8 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 167   Filed 02/11/20   Page 9 of 21\ndrain on the organization’s resources[.]’” City of Kyle, 626 F.3d at 237 (quoting Havens \nRealty Corp., 455 U.S. at 379). Indeed, TDP does not allege diversion of any resources \nat all to combat Defendants’ allegedly unlawful conduct. Cf. id. \nDSCC’s and DCCC’s cursory allegation of efforts to “combat the effects of \nTexas’s conduct” also fails to establish injury-in-fact. As explained in City of Kyle, \n“[n]ot every diversion of resources to counteract [a] defendant’s conduct [] establishes \nan injury in fact.” 626 F.3d at 238 (quoting Havens Realty Corp., 455 U.S. at 379). \nRather, any “[s]uch injury must be ‘concrete and demonstrable.’” Id. And, plainly, \nDSCC and DCCC do not state that they have “diverted significant resources to \ncounteract  the  [Defendants’]  conduct”  such  that  “the  [Defendants’]  conduct \nsignificantly and ‘perceptibly impaired’ the organization’s ability to” engage in its \n“routine activities,” as required to allege organizational standing. City of Kyle, 626 \nF.3d at 238. \nInstead,  voter  education  and  outreach  are  already  central  to  these \norganizations’  “routine  activities.”  Id.;  Dkt.  137,  ¶¶11-13.  GOTV  and  voter-\nengagement efforts that these entities would engage in regardless of Defendants’ \nallegedly unlawful conduct do not amount to “concrete and demonstrable” injury to \nDSCC or DCCC. Havens Realty Corp., 455 U.S. at 379; City of Kyle, 626 F.3d at 238. \nPut differently, neither DSCC nor DCCC claims  that voter outreach efforts fall \noutside the “normal, day-to-day operations of the group.” Cf. Fowler, 178 F.3d at 358. \nNone of the Democratic Party Intervenors has alleged injury-in-fact as required to \nshow standing. \n9 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 167   Filed 02/11/20   Page 10 of 21\nThe “injury-in-fact” element of standing “serves to distinguish a person with a \ndirect stake in the outcome of a litigation—even though small—from a person with a \nmere interest in the problem.” United States v. Students Challenging Regulatory \nAgency Procedures, 412 U.S. 669, 689 n.14 (1973). Because the Democratic Party \nIntervenors have at most alleged that they are interested in the issues raised in \nStringer I, this Court should dismiss them from this case for failure to allege injury-\nin-fact in their own right. \n2.  Associational Standing \n \nUnder the doctrine of associational standing, an association may have standing \nto bring suit on behalf of its members when: \n[1] its members would otherwise have standing to sue in their own right; \n[2] the interests it seeks to protect are germane to the organization's \npurpose; and [3] neither the claim asserted nor the relief requested \nrequires the participation of individual members in the lawsuit. \n \nNat'l Rifle Ass'n of Am., Inc. v. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, & Explosives, \n700 F.3d 185, 191 (5th Cir. 2012) (quoting Ass’n of Am. Physicians & Surgeons, Inc. \nv. Tex. Med. Bd., 627 F.3d 547, 550 (5th Cir.2010)) (citation omitted). The Democratic \nParty Intervenors do not allege facts to establish any of these factors. \n  As to the first prong, a plaintiff cannot have associational standing unless one \nof its members would have standing to sue individually. See Hunt v. Wash. State \nApple Advert. Comm’n, 432 U.S. 333, 343 (1977); Ctr. for Biological Diversity v. EPA, \n937 F.3d 533, 536 (5th Cir. 2019). Thus, each intervenor must “identify members who \nhave suffered the requisite harm” for injury-in-fact. Summers v. Earth Island Inst., \n555 U.S. 488, 499 (2009); United Food & Comm. Workers Union Loc. 751 v. Brown \n10 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 167   Filed 02/11/20   Page 11 of 21\nGrp., Inc., 517 U.S. 544, 555 (1996) (An “association ‘can establish standing only as \nrepresentatives of those of their members who have been injured in fact, and thus \ncould have brought suit in their own right.’”) (quoting Simon v. E. Ky. Welfare Rights \nOrg., 426 U.S. 26, 40 (1976)). \nDSCC and DCCC do not allege the existence of specific members—let alone \nspecific members who would have standing in their own right. See Dkt. 137. Not \nhaving  members  is  fatal  to  associational  standing.  See  Hunt,  432  U.S.  at  344 \n(requiring “indicia of membership in an organization” for associational standing); City \nof Olmsted Falls v. FAA, 292 F.3d 261, 267–68 (D.C. Cir. 2002). TDP does allege that \nit “has millions of members and constituents from across Texas.” Dkt. 137, ¶11. It \nfurther states that those members “include[] millions of Texans who are registered \nwith the Texas Department of State’s Division of Elections as Democrats, millions of \nTexans who are drivers who interact with DPS, and many other Texans who regularly \nsupport and vote for candidates affiliated with the Democratic Party.” Dkt. 137, ¶11.6 \nBut  TDP’s  failure  to  identify  any  member  with  specificity  is  fatal  to  its \nassociational standing. See, e.g., City of Kyle, 626 F.3d at 237 (requiring evidence of \n“a specific member”); Ga. Republican Party v. SEC, 888 F.3d 1198, 1203 (11th Cir. \n2018); Draper v. Healey, 827 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 2016) (dismissing under Rule 12(b)(1) \nbecause plaintiff did not identify a member affected by the challenged regulation). \nAnd even if TDP had identified a specific member, it did not plead “a continuing \nor threatened future injury” as required to establish standing here. Cf. Stringer v. \n                                            \n6 Texas does not have a “Department of State,” and will presume for purposes of this Motion that TDP \nrefers to the Texas “Secretary of State.” \n11 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 167   Filed 02/11/20   Page 12 of 21\nWhitley, 942 F.3d at 721. As the Fifth Circuit explained in Stringer I, to establish \nstanding, a plaintiff “must demonstrate a sufficient probability that [they] will use” \nthe challenged “driver’s license services again.” Id. at 722. Where “Plaintiffs do not \npoint to any Plaintiff-specific evidence suggesting that they will become unregistered \nand eligible to renew their driver’s licenses using the DPS System,” they “have not \nestablished  a  substantial  risk  that  they  will  attempt  to  update  their  voter \nregistrations using the DPS System and be injured by their inability to do so.” Id. at \n723. “As a result,” such “Plaintiffs have not established an injury in fact sufficient to \nconfer standing to pursue the declaratory and injunctive relief that they seek.” Id. \nTo be sure, Stringer v. Whitley was an appeal from cross-motions for summary \njudgment after the development of a record. But even at the pleading stage, a litigant \nmust at least allege facts which would demonstrate standing if true. E.g., Lujan, 504 \nU.S. at 561. And here, TDP merely alleges having members who “interact with DPS.” \nThus, even if all their factual allegations were proven, they still could not “establish[] \na substantial risk that” any member “will attempt to update their voter registrations \nusing the DPS System and be injured by their inability to do so.” Id. at 723. \nThe  Democratic  Party  Intervenors  also  fail  the  second  prong  of  the \nassociational standing analysis, as they have not identified any interest germane to \ntheir purpose that is to be served by this litigation. While their missions are to elect \nDemocratic candidates, this lawsuit seeks to compel Texas to register voters and \nupdate  existing  registrations  absent  a  written,  signed  request  from  the  voter. \nCompare Dkt. 137 at 10-11 (“Prayer for Relief”) with Dkt. 137 ¶¶11-13. Despite the \n12 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 167   Filed 02/11/20   Page 13 of 21\nfact  that  “[t]he  germaneness  requirement  is  ‘undemanding’  and  requires  ‘mere \npertinence’ between the litigation at issue and the organization’s purpose,” at least \nthat pertinence is still required. Ass’n of Am. Physicians & Surgeons, Inc. v. Tex. Med. \nBd., 627 F.3d at 551 n. 2. The records of all voters (regardless of political affiliation) \nwho move between Texas counties and transact with DPS online is not “pertinent” to \nthe Democratic Party Intervenors’ specific mission to elect Democratic candidates. \nThe  Democratic  Party  Intervenors  also  fail  the  third  prong,  because  the \nparticipation of individual members is required to obtain the relief they request. It is \nnot enough to allege the existence of members eligible to transact with DPS online. \nThey still must bring a claim that is “not particular to any individual” and “thus \nproperly resolved in a group context.” Gulf Restoration Network, Inc. v. Salazar, 683 \nF.3d 158, 168 (5th Cir. 2012). They cannot do so where, as here, individual voter \nregistrations are at the heart of their challenge. Cf., e.g., Church of Scientology v. \nCazares, 638 F.2d 1272, 1276-80 (5th Cir. 1981) (individual participation not required \nwhere  “the  claim  asserted  and  the  relief requested  affect  the  membership  as a \nwhole”); Familias Unidas v. Briscoe, 619 F.2d 391, 398 n. 2 (5th Cir. 1980) (“the \ndeclaratory relief sought, inuring as it would to the benefit of all members, is ideally \nsuited to allowing ‘associational standing.’”) (citation omitted). \n3.  Statutory Standing \n \nEven if the Democratic Party Intervenors had Article III standing, they would \nstill lack statutory standing. See Lexmark Int’l, Inc. v. Static Control Components, \nInc.,  572  U.S.  118, 128  n.4  (2014) (explaining  statutory  standing).  Section 1983 \n13 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 167   Filed 02/11/20   Page 14 of 21\nprovides a cause of action only when the plaintiff suffers “the deprivation of any \nrights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws.” 42 U.S.C. \n§ 1983. It does not provide a cause of action to plaintiffs claiming an injury based on \nthe violation of a third party’s rights. See Coon v. Ledbetter, 780 F.2d 1158, 1160 (5th \nCir.  1986)  (“[L]ike  all  persons  who  claim  a  deprivation  of  constitutional  rights, \n[plaintiffs] were required to prove some violation of their personal rights.”); David P. \nCurrie, Misunderstanding Standing, 1981 Sup. Ct. Rev. 41, 45. \nThus, § 1983 follows the general rule that a plaintiff “must assert [her] own \nlegal rights and interests, and cannot rest [her] claim to relief on the legal rights or \ninterests of third parties.” Danos v. Jones, 652 F.3d 577, 582 (5th Cir. 2011) (quoting \nWarth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 499 (1975)) (alterations original). When “[t]he alleged \nrights at issue” belong to a third party, rather than the plaintiff, the plaintiff lacks \nstatutory standing, regardless of Article III standing. Id.; see also Conn v. Gabbert, \n526 U.S. 286, 292–93 (1999) (holding that lawyer “clearly had no standing” to bring \n§ 1983 claim for injury suffered as a result of “the alleged infringement of the rights \nof his client” because a plaintiff “generally must assert his own legal rights and \ninterests, and cannot rest his claim to relief on the legal rights or interests of third \nparties.”) \nThe Democratic Party Intervenors assert an equal protection claim in the \ncontext of voter registration. But, as artificial entities, the TDP, DCCC, and DSCC do \nnot have voting rights. “It goes without saying that political parties, although the \nprincipal players in the political process, do not have the right to vote.” Vieth v. \n14 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 167   Filed 02/11/20   Page 15 of 21\nPennsylvania, 188 F. Supp. 2d 532, 546 (M.D. Pa. 2002); see also Concerned Home \nCare Providers, Inc. v. Cuomo, 783 F.3d 77, 91 (2d Cir. 2015) (“But Plaintiffs—five \ncorporations and a not-for-profit trade organization—are not entitled to vote and have \nno  right  to  equal  representation  in  the  legislature.”)  The  Democratic  Party \nIntervenors are necessarily asserting the rights of third parties, and lack statutory \nstanding to sue under § 1983. \nII.  The Democratic Party Intervenors should be dismissed under Rule \n12(b)(6) for failure to state a cognizable Equal Protection claim. \n \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) “authorizes a court to dismiss a claim \non the basis of a dispositive issue of law.” Neitzke v. William, 490 U.S. 319, 326 (1989) \n(citations omitted). “This procedure, operating on the assumption that the factual \nallegations  in  the  complaint  are  true,  streamlines  litigation by  dispensing  with \nneedless discovery and factfinding.” Id. at 326-27. Thus, the issue under Rule 12(b)(6) \nis whether the Complaint alleges “enough facts to state a claim to relief that is \nplausible on its face,” assuming that the allegations are true. Bell Atlantic Corp. v. \nTwombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007). Notably, “[t]he tenet that a court must accept as \ntrue  all  of  the  allegations  contained  in  a  complaint  is  inapplicable  to  legal \nconclusions.” Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (citing Bell Atlantic Corp. v. \nTwombly, 550 U.S. at 555).  \nNone of the Democratic Party Intervenors alleges a violation of the NVRA. See \nDkt. 137. Instead, they allege a violation of the Equal Protection Clause. As set forth \nsupra, none has standing to pursue such a claim in its own right or as an association \n15 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 167   Filed 02/11/20   Page 16 of 21\nrepresenting its members. But even if standing could be established, the Democratic \nParty Intervenors’ equal protection claim would fail on the merits. \nA.  Democratic Party Intervenors \n \nTexas’s handling of online transactions with DPS does not violate the Equal \nProtection  Clause  with  respect  to  the  Democratic  Party  Intervenors.  An  equal \nprotection  claim  involving  voting  rights  requires  allegation  of  “intentional \ndiscrimination against an identifiable political group and an actual discriminatory \neffect on that group.” Republican Party of N.C. v. Martin, 980 F.2d 943, 955 (4th Cir. \n1992) (citation omitted); see also, e.g., Veasey v. Abbott, 830 F.3d 216, 230 (5th Cir. \n2016) (en banc) (stating that “[p]roof of racially discriminatory intent or purpose is \nrequired to show a violation of the Equal Protection Clause”) (quoting Village of \nArlington  Heights  v.  Metro.  Hous.  Dev.  Corp.,  429  U.S.  252,  265  (1977)).  The \nDemocratic Party Intervenors have not plausibly alleged intentional or purposeful \ndiscrimination in which one class is favored over another. \nStatutes providing neutral rules, which might benefit any political party, are \nnot rendered discriminatory by the fact that they benefit one party when applied in \nparticular circumstances. See Rodriguez v. Popular Democratic Party, 457 U.S. 1, 10 \nn.10  (1982)  (holding  that  “a  statute  providing  that  all  such  vacancies  [in  the \nlegislature] be filled by appointment does not have a special impact on any discrete \ngroup of voters or candidates” and thus is not discriminatory for equal-protection \npurposes). Here, the Democratic Party Intervenors do not even allege that Texas’s \nhandling  of  online  driver  license  renewal  and  change  of  address  transactions \n16 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 167   Filed 02/11/20   Page 17 of 21\ndisproportionately impacts them. And they certainly do not allege that it is the result \nof “intentional discrimination” against Democrats. Cf. Republican Party of N.C. v. \nMartin, 980 F.2d at 955. \nThe Democratic Party Intervenors fail to state an equal protection claim. \nB.  Individual Voters \n \nConsideration of the equal protection rights of individual voters would require \nassociational standing, which the Democratic Party Intervenors have not alleged. See \nsupra, Part I(B)(2). But even if they had, Texas’s handling of online driver license \nrenewal and change of address transactions does not violate any individual’s right to \nequal protection. This is because Texas’s written-signature requirement for new \nvoter-registration  applications  and  requests  to  update  voter-registration \ninformation—which prevents online voter-registration transactions—applies equally \nto everyone and does not impose an unconstitutional burden on the right to vote. See \nTEX. ELEC. CODE §§ 13.002(b), 15.021(a), (d); see also id. § 20.066(a)(1). \nIn evaluating an alleged burden on voting rights, the Anderson/Burdick test \nrequires the Court to “first consider the character and magnitude of the asserted \ninjury to the rights protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments that the \nplaintiff seeks to vindicate.” Voting for Am., Inc. v. Steen, 732 F.3d 382, 387 (5th Cir. \n2013) (quoting Anderson, 460 U.S. at 789). Then, the Court “must identify and \nevaluate the precise interest put forward by the State as justifications for the burden \nimposed by its rule.” Id. (quoting Anderson, 460 U.S. at 789). Finally, the Court \nweighs the “character and magnitude of the asserted in-jury” against the “precise \n17 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 167   Filed 02/11/20   Page 18 of 21\ninterests put forward by the State,” taking into consideration “the extent to which \nthose interests make it necessary to burden the plaintiff’s rights.” Id. at 387-88 \n(quoting Burdick, 504 U.S. at 434). When a state election law provision imposes only \n“reasonable,  nondiscriminatory  restrictions”  upon  the  First  and  Fourteenth \nAmendment rights of voters, “the state’s important regulatory interests are generally \nsufficient to justify” the restrictions. Anderson, 460 U.S. at 788.  \nAs  to  the  “character  and  magnitude  of  the  asserted  injury  to  the  rights \nprotected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments” at issue, Democratic Party \nIntervenors  assert  that  individuals  who  choose  to  use  DPS’s  online  system  are \nburdened because—unlike individuals who choose to interact with DPS in person or \nby mail—online users cannot simply check a box to become registered to vote or \nchange their registration address. See generally Dkt. 137. Instead, individuals using \nDPS’s online system must print out a voter-registration form, fill it out, sign it, and \nmail it, which satisfies Texas’s written-signature requirement. \nTexans can register to vote in several ways: in person, by mail, or by fax. TEX. \nELEC. CODE § 13.002(a). Texas law also permits voter registration in conjunction with \na driver’s license transaction (either in person or by mail). But because of Texas’s \nwritten signature requirement, id. § 13.002(b), Texas has never permitted online \nvoter registration. \nBeing treated like everyone else—making a written, signed request to register \nto vote or update voter-registration information—does not burden any individual’s \nright to equal protection. If an individual desires the simplicity of checking a single \n18 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 167   Filed 02/11/20   Page 19 of 21\nbox, they may fill out a paper registration form. Stated differently, providing multiple \noptions for individuals to register to vote is not a violation of the Equal Protection \nClause even if the Democratic Party Intervenors consider some options to be less \nconvenient than others. \nThe interests of the State in requiring written signatures, which necessarily \nforecloses  online  registration,  include  maintaining  accurate  voting  rolls  and \ncombatting fraud. It cannot be debated that States have an interest in requiring a \nsignature from voters. See, e.g., 52 U.S.C. § 20504(c). And Texas can use written \nsignatures in cases of fraud, identity theft, and consideration of absentee ballots. See, \ne.g. Husted v. A. Philip Randolph Inst., 138 S. Ct. 1833, 1838 (2018) (“It has been \nestimated that 24 million voter registrations in the United States—about one in \neight—are either invalid or significantly inaccurate.”) (citation omitted). \nThe Fifth Circuit has also recognized that preventing voter-registration fraud \nis a permissible state interest that warrants some limits on voter registration. Voting \nfor Am., 732 F.3d at 394-95. It is not necessary for Defendants to produce specific \nevidence of fraud to justify preventative measures. Id. (citing Crawford v. Marion \nCty. Election Bd., 553 U.S. 181, 196 (2008) (plurality op.)); see Short v. Brown, 893 \nF.3d 671, 679 (9th Cir. 2018) (finding “general interest in increasing voter turnout” \nsufficient to justify experimental use of mail-in ballots in specific counties); Tripp v. \nScholz, 872 F.3d 857, 866 (7th Cir. 2017) (finding “speculative concern” sufficient to \njustify ballot-access limitation); Ohio Democratic Party v. Husted, 834 F.3d 620, 632 \n(6th Cir. 2016) (holding that when a regulation is “not unduly burdensome,” a State \n19 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 167   Filed 02/11/20   Page 20 of 21\ndoes not have to “prove” that evidence supports its interest; the court may defer to \nthe legislature’s findings); cf. Husted, 138 S. Ct. at 1847 (cautioning that compliance \nwith the NVRA did not require the State to make “a wise policy judgment” or “have \nsome particular quantum of evidence of a change of residence” before taking steps to \nverify a voter’s address); Munro v. Socialist Workers Party, 479 U.S. 189, 195 (1986) \n(“Legislatures . . . should be permitted to respond to potential deficiencies in the \nelectoral process with foresight rather than reactively . . . .”). \nA State may act to prevent potential fraud, as “[a]ny corruption in voter \nregistration affects a state’s paramount obligation to ensure the integrity of the \nvoting process and threatens the public’s right to democratic government.” Voting for \nAm., 732 F.3d at 394. Balancing individual voter equal-protection rights against the \nState’s interests reveals no unconstitutional burden on the right to vote. The State \nhas provided several options to register to vote, all of which satisfy the State’s \nwritten-signature  requirement.  Whether  to  permit  online  registration  is  a \nquintessentially state-law function, absent a preemptive federal law requiring it. U.S. \nCONST. art. I, § 4, cl. 1. No such law exists. The Equal Protection Clause does not \nrequire what the Democratic Party Intervenors demand, and no individual’s right to \nvote is unconstitutionally burdened by Texas’s written-signature requirement for \nvoter registration. \n \n \n \n20 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 167   Filed 02/11/20   Page 21 of 21\nCONCLUSION & PRAYER \n  The Democratic Party Intervenors’ complaint should be dismissed for lack of \njurisdiction and for failure to state a claim on which relief may be granted. \nRespectfully submitted, \n \nKEN PAXTON \nAttorney General of Texas \n \nJEFFREY C.

Additionally, Defendants must provide the Court with the following: \na.  If Defendants' practices have changed since Stringer I, describe each change, why it \nwas made, when it was made, and who decided to make such change(s). If no \nchanges occurred, whether there have been any discussions about making changes.3 \nb.

Explain why this language in Step 5 of the online \nprocess is different than the language contained in DL-14A, DL-43, and DL-64, as \nreflected on page 13 of Plaintiffs' Emergency Application for Preliminary Injunction. \nc.  Since the inception of online services, the number of persons who, like Jarrod \nStringer, have more than once renewed or updated their driver's license online \nthrough DPS, answered \"yes\" to the voter registration/application question or \nindicated that they wanted to register to vote or update their voter registration as \npart of the same transaction, and were not simultaneously permitted to do so. \nd.

See Dkts. 124; 124-2. Putative Intervenors allege1 that they are “a \nstatewide organization and national committees that are invested in the success of \nDemocratic candidates, including in Texas,” and that Defendants’ handling of online \ndriver license transactions violates equal protection and “frustrate[s] these efforts, \nforcing Intervenors to devote additional resources to combat Defendants’ ongoing \nviolations  that  could  otherwise  be  allocated  to  different  portions  of  Intervenors’ \nmission.” Dkt. 124 at 3-4. Putative Intervenors seek to intervene as a matter of right \nunder Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24(a)(2) or, in the alternative, permissively \nunder 24(b)(1)(B). Dkt. 124. \n                                            \n1 Courts accept a movant’s non-conclusory factual allegations as true for purposes of an intervention \nrequest. Mendenhall v. M/V Toyota Maru No. 11, 551 F.2d 55, 56 n.2 (5th Cir. 1977) (citation omitted). \n1 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 133   Filed 01/10/20   Page 2 of 13\nThe motion to intervene should be denied for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction \nbecause  there  is  no  longer  a  live  case  or  controversy  in  which  to  intervene. \n“Jurisdiction is power to declare the law, and when it ceases to exist, the only function \nremaining to the court is that of announcing the fact and dismissing the cause.” Steel \nCo. v. Citizens for a Better Env’t, 523 U.S. 83, 94 (1998) (quoting Ex parte McCardle, \n74 U.S. 506 (1868)). Thus, once the Court of Appeals issued its mandate remanding \nthe case with “instructions to dismiss Plaintiffs’ claims for lack of standing,” Stringer \nv. Whitley, 942 F. 3d 715, 725 (5th Cir. 2019), any action otherwise would exceed this \nCourt’s jurisdiction and violate the Court of Appeals’ mandate. \nBut even if—despite the appellate finding of no jurisdiction—the Court could \nentertain the intervention motion, such relief would be improper because Putative \nIntervenors failed to timely pursue intervention. Timeliness is a requirement of both \nmandatory and permissive intervention. But Putative Intervenors failed to pursue \nintervention until nearly four years after suit was filed. The decision, year after year, \nnot  to  intervene  was  certainly  the Putative  Intervenors’  to  make.  They  cannot, \nhowever,  undo  that  decision  at  this  late  hour,  with  no  live  Article  III  case  or \ncontroversy before the Court. \n \n \n \n \n \n2 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 133   Filed 01/10/20   Page 3 of 13\nARGUMENT AND AUTHORITY \nI.  The Court lacks jurisdiction to permit or allow intervention. \n \nA. Once the Court of Appeals declared Plaintiffs’ case \njurisdictionally defective, there ceased to be an existing suit \nwithin this Court’s jurisdiction in which to intervene. \n \nIt has been settled law for nearly a century that “[a]n existing suit within the \ncourt’s jurisdiction is a prerequisite of an intervention.” Kendrick v. Kendrick, 16 F.2d \n744, 745 (5th Cir. 1926), cert. denied, 273 U.S. 758 (1927) (denying intervention where \ncourt did not have jurisdiction over original lawsuit because of lack of indispensable \nparties). Thus, “a person may not intervene if the original, underlying case was \njurisdictionally defective.” Odle v. Flores, 899 F.3d 344, 348 (5th Cir. 2017) (citing \nNon Commissioned Officers Ass’n v. Army Times Publ’g Co., 637 F.2d 372, 373 (5th \nCir. 1981)); see also id. (“‘[t]here is no right . . . to intervene in a [jurisdictionally] \ndefective suit.’”) (quoting Truvillion v. King’s Daughters Hosp., 614 F.2d 520, 526 (5th \nCir. 1980)) (alteration in Odle). \nThe question of whether there is an existing suit within the court’s jurisdiction \nis based upon “when the motion to intervene was filed.” Krim v. PCOrder.com, 402 \nF.3d 489, 502 (5th Cir. 2005); see also id. at 502 (“The ‘prerequisite of an intervention’ \nthat there be ‘an existing suit within the Court’s jurisdiction’ depends here on the \nindividual claims. That none of the individual claims remained viable . . . when the \nmotion to intervene was filed, disposes of the attempt at intervention.”) (quoting \nArmy Times Publ’g Co., 637 F.2d at 373). \n3 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 133   Filed 01/10/20   Page 4 of 13\n  When the Court of Appeals issued its mandate on December 5, 2019, there \nceased to be “an existing suit within the Court’s jurisdiction” because—at that point—\n“none of the individual claims” upon which Plaintiffs invoked the Court’s jurisdiction \n“remained viable.” E.g., Krim v. PCOrder.com, 402 F.3d at 502. See also, e.g., Ericsson \nInc. v. InterDigital Communs. Corp., 418 F.3d 1217, 1222 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (rejecting \nthe argument that—because the district court retained jurisdiction to entertain a \nmotion for relief from final judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b), \nthere  was  “an  existing  suit  within  the  court’s  jurisdiction”  for  purposes  of \nintervention) (citing Kendrick, 16 F.2d at 745). \nB. Putative Intervenors’ authorities do not support a different \nresult. \n \nPutative Intervenors assert that they have “independent bases for standing to \nassert the equal protection claims brought by Plaintiffs” which “provide the Court \njurisdiction to continue this action.” Dkt. 124 at 1. But they cite only one case as direct \nsupport for the proposition that “intervenors with independent grounds to maintain \nan action may cure jurisdictional defects even after the action is dismissed.” Dkt. 124 \nat 6 (citing Hunt Tool Co. v. Moore, Inc., 212 F.2d 685, 688-89 (5th Cir. 1954)). And \nHunt does not support the proposition that a post-judgment, post-appeal motion to \nintervene can cure a jurisdictionally defective case. \nThe intervenor in Hunt, a dispute over oil leasehold rights, intervened well \nbefore  the  district  court  entered  final  judgment  (and  certainly  before  any  post-\njudgment appeal). 212 F. 2d at 686. After the intervention, the trial court dismissed \nthe lawsuit between the original parties on their request after they settled it in a \n4 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 133   Filed 01/10/20   Page 5 of 13\nparallel state court action. Id. at 686. The remaining defendant then sought to \ndismiss the intervention for lack of diversity jurisdiction. Id. at 687.  \nThe Fifth Circuit found that “[w]hen the intervention was filed the requisite \ndiversity  of  citizenship  was  not  present,”  but  concluded  that  the  intervenor’s \nvoluntary dismissal of “all defendants from the intervention save Moore, Inc., a \nGeorgia corporation, cured the jurisdictional defects . . . since the defendants whom \nintervener dismissed were not indispensable parties.” Id. at 688. Thus, it found that \nthe district court erred in granting the defendant’s motion to dismiss for lack of \ndiversity jurisdiction. Id. \nUnlike  Putative  Intervenors  here,  the  Hunt  intervenor  “cured  the \njurisdictional defects” in the case. Id. And it did so not just prior to appeal, but before \nthe district court passed on the jurisdictional arguments. Id. at 686. Because Hunt \ndid not contemplate a situation like this one—where jurisdiction is already defeated \nbefore intervention is sought—it does not support Putative Intervenors’ position. \nPutative Intervenors also cite cases about political party standing generally. \nDkt. 124 at 3-4. These, too, are inapposite. The cases about political party standing \nall involved political party litigants who had initiated the action as an original party. \nSee Crawford v. Marion Cty. Elec. Bd., 553 U.S. 181, 186-187 (2008); Tex. Democratic \nParty v. Benkiser, 459 F.3d 582, 585 (5th Cir. 2006)); Legislative Black Caucus v. \nAlabama, 575 U.S. 254 (2015), accord Ala. Legislative Black Caucus v. Alabama, 989 \nF. Supp. 2d 1227, 1234 (M.D. Ala. 2013) (party and party-affiliated plaintiffs initiated \nlawsuit); Sandusky Cty. Democratic Party v. Blackwell, 387 F.3d 565, 570 at n.2 (6th \n5 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 133   Filed 01/10/20   Page 6 of 13\nCir. 2004) (intervenors were individuals, not party or party affiliate); Fla. Democratic \nParty v. Scott, 215 F. Supp. 3d 1250 (N.D. Fla. 2016) (intervenors were Mi Familia \nVota  Education  Fund,  New  Florid  Majority,  and  Andra  del  Castillo);  Bay  Cty. \nDemocratic Party v. Land, 347 F. Supp. 2d 404, 418 (E.D. Mich. 2004) (denying motion \nto intervene by voter and county and municipal clerks in their official capacities). \nNone of these cases involved intervention in a case after remand to the district \ncourt for dismissal for lack of jurisdiction. And Putative Intervenors did not file this \nlawsuit as original plaintiffs or seek to intervene while it ran its course. These \nauthorities are therefore unhelpful. \nThe  remaining  two  cases  Putative  Intervenors  cite  in  support  of  their \njurisdictional argument similarly miss the mark. Dkt. 124 at 5. Summit Office Park, \nInc. v. U.S. Steel Corp., 639 F.2d 1278, 1282 (5th Cir. 1981), discussed the propriety \nof pre-judgment leave to amend a complaint in class action, and therefore has nothing \nto do with this case. Simmons v. I.C.C., 716 F.2d 40, 46 (D.C. Cir. 1983), which \nconsidered  who  could  properly  intervene  in  action  for  judicial  review  of \nadministrative order subject to the Hobbs Act, is similarly unrelated to the facts here. \nThe motion to intervene should be denied for lack of jurisdiction.2 \nII.  Intervention would defy the Court of Appeals’ mandate.  \n \nThe last sentence of the court of appeals’ opinion remanded the case to this \nCourt “with instructions to dismiss Plaintiffs’ claims for lack of standing.” Stringer v. \nWhitley, 942 F. 3d at 725. The judgment of the court of appeals, issued as its mandate, \n                                            \n2 It is worth noting that, as stated in the discussion of discovery below, Defendants do not concede \nthat Putative Intervenors have standing. \n6 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 133   Filed 01/10/20   Page 7 of 13\ninstructed this Court to act “in accordance with the opinion” of the Fifth Circuit. Dkt. \n122-1. When the mandate requires dismissal for lack of jurisdiction, “[c]ompliance \nwith an order to relinquish jurisdiction necessarily precludes the lower court from \ntaking any further action other than dismissal, for to do so would involve retaining \njurisdiction.” Stamper v. Baskerville, 724 F.2d 1106, 1108 (4th Cir. 1984). \nThe Court may not reconsider the court of appeals’ jurisdictional ruling or \navoid its mandate. Under law-of-the-case doctrine, “the district court on remand, or \nthe appellate court on a subsequent appeal, abstains from reexamining an issue of \nfact or law that has already been decided on appeal.” United States v. Teel, 691 F.3d \n578, 582 (5th Cir. 2012). A corollary of the law-of-the-case doctrine is the mandate \nrule, which “requires a district court on remand to effect [the court’s] mandate and to \ndo nothing else.” Gen Universal Sys., Inc. v. HAL, Inc., 500 F.3d 444, 453 (5th Cir. \n2004) (citation and quotation marks omitted). \nThe only exceptions to the mandate rule are “(1) [t]he evidence at a subsequent \ntrial is substantially different; (2) there has been an intervening change of law by a \ncontrolling authority; and (3) the earlier decision is clearly erroneous and would work \na manifest injustice.” Demahy v. Schwarz Pharma, Inc., 702 F.3d 177, 184-85 (5th \nCir. 2012). Only if one of these three circumstances is present may an appellate court \nrevisit  previously-decided  matters,  or  a  district  court  can  exceed  a  mandate  on \nremand. Id. at 185 (citing United States v. Lee, 358 F.3d 315, 320 (5th Cir. 2004)); see \nalso United States v. Matthews, 312 F.3d 652, 657 (5th Cir. 2002) (describing same \nthree scenarios under which departure from mandate is permissible). But none of \n7 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 133   Filed 01/10/20   Page 8 of 13\nthese exceptions applies where, as here, a case has ceased to exist due to jurisdictional \ndefect.  \nIntervention should be denied to comply with the mandate rule. \nIII.  Even if this Court had jurisdiction to consider the motion to \nintervene, it would fail on the merits. \n \nAs set forth above, Putative Intervenors cite no authority for the proposition \nthat—on remand from the Court of Appeals with instructions to dismiss all live \nclaims in the case for lack of jurisdiction—a district court has authority to consider a \nmotion to intervene. But even if there were support for this proposition, the Putative \nIntervenors have not established that they are entitled to intervene as a matter of \nright under Rule 24 (a)(2) or that permissive intervention under Rule 24 (b)(1)(B) is \nproper.  \nA. Putative Intervenors have not shown entitlement to intervene \nas a matter of right. \n \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 24(a)(2) governs mandatory intervention. A \nparty  seeking  to  intervene  as  of  right  must  satisfy  four  requirements:  (1)  the \napplication must be timely; (2) the applicant must have an interest relating to the \nproperty or transaction that is the subject of the action; (3) the applicant must be so \nsituated that the disposition of the action may, as a practical matter, impair or \nimpede its ability to protect its interest; and (4) the applicant’s interest must be \ninadequately represented by the existing parties to the suit. Brumfield v. Dodd, 749 \nF.3d 339, 341 (5th Cir. 2014) (citation omitted); see FED. R. CIV. P. 24(a)(2). “Failure \nto satisfy one requirement precludes intervention of right.” Haspel & Davis Milling \n8 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 133   Filed 01/10/20   Page 9 of 13\n& Planting Co. Ltd. v. Bd. of Levee Comm’rs of the Orleans Levee Dist., 493 F.3d 570, \n578 (5th Cir. 2007). The Putative Intervenors fail to satisfy at least two of these \nrequirements. \nFirst, their allegation that they will be impaired or impeded in protecting any \nequal protection interest they assert fails of its face, given their admission that they \n“can bring a new action” against Defendants. Dkt. 124 at 7. Indeed, less than three \nweeks after filing their motion to intervene, the Putative Intervenors filed a new \nlawsuit against the Texas Secretary of State, bringing an equal-protection claim \nregarding Texas’s requirement of “wet” signatures on voter registration applications. \nSee Tex. Dem. Party v. Hughs, No. 5:20-CV-0008 (filed Jan. 6, 2020, and arguing it is \nrelated to this suit). \nSecond, the motion to intervene is not timely. In this Circuit, the timeliness of \na motion to intervene turns on four factors: \n(1) The length of time during which the would-be intervenor actually \nknew or reasonably should have known of its interest in the case \nbefore it petitioned for leave to intervene; \n \n(2) the extent of the prejudice that the existing parties to the litigation \nmay suffer as a result of the would-be intervenor’s failure to apply \nfor intervention as soon as it knew or reasonably should have known \nof its interest in the case; \n \n(3) the extent of the prejudice that the would-be intervenor may suffer \nif intervention is denied; and \n \n(4) the  existence  of  unusual  circumstances  militating  either  for  or \nagainst a determination that the application is timely. \n \nSierra Club v. Espy, 18 F.3d 1202, 1205 (5th Cir. 1994). \n9 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 133   Filed 01/10/20   Page 10 of 13\nWith respect to the first factor, Plaintiffs sent their statutorily required NVRA \npresuit notice letter alleging noncompliance with the NVRA in 2015, and Putative \nIntervenors acknowledge awareness of this lawsuit—if not upon its filing, then soon \nafter. E.g., Dkt. 124 (“Until the Fifth Circuit’s ruling, Plaintiffs had been adequately \nrepresenting and protecting Intervenors’ interests, so Intervenors had neither the \nnecessity nor the right to intervene.”) For purposes of timeliness, “[w]hat matters is \nnot when [a putative intervenor] knew or should have known that his interests would \nbe adversely affected but, instead, when he knew that he had an interest in the case.” \nSommers v. Bank of Am., N.A., 835 F.3d 509, 513 (5th Cir. 2016). Given the delay in \nseeking intervention, the first factor favors denial of the motion. \nTo the extent it is even proper to consider prejudice to “existing parties” after \nclaims are dismissed for lack of jurisdiction, this factor also favors denial. Throughout \nthe life of this litigation, the only Plaintiffs have been individuals who did not claim \nany harm to Putative Intervenor’s “mission to elect Democratic representatives.” Dkt. \n124-2 at ¶33. But rather than intervene at any point during the past four years to \nvindicate this asserted injury (or allow Defendants to argue against it), Putative \nIntervenors stood by as the parties conducted discovery and filed multiple dispositive \nmotions, and as the Court considered and ruled upon these arguments and fashioned \nan injunction. Throughout, Defendants made no secret of their belief that Plaintiffs \nlacked standing. See, e.g., Dkts. 7 at 6-13; 12 at 1-5; 57 at 17; 82 at 12-19; 86 at 4-11; \n88 at 4-11. Still, Defendants did not seek to intervene, even as the parties briefed and \nargued an appeal. \n10 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 133   Filed 01/10/20   Page 11 of 13\nYet, Putative Intervenors appear to wish to deny Defendants the opportunity \nto conduct discovery on their claims. See Dkt. 124 at 7 (“Intervenors are not seeking \nto  reopen  discovery  but  instead  merely wish  to  file  a  dispositive  motion.”).  But \nDefendants have the right to conduct discovery, as a suit claiming harm to three \nindividuals is vastly different from a suit claiming harm across the State. This \nlawsuit  is  over;  reopening  the  discovery  process  (as  will  be  required  to  allow \nDefendants to adequately defend their laws) will require additional time and expense, \nprejudicing Defendants. The second factor favors denial of the motion. \nBy contrast, with respect to the third factor, putative intervenors concede that \nthey will not be prejudiced in the ability to urge their claims if they cannot intervene. \nDkt. 124 at 7 (stating that Putative Intervenors “can bring a new action” against \nDefendants). And, as noted above, they have already filed a lawsuit that Putative \nIntervenors contend is related to this case. The third factor also favors denial of the \nmotion. \nFinally, in considering any “unusual circumstances” of the case, it is worth \nnoting that Putative Intervenors have only sought to involve themselves now that the \nCourt is without jurisdiction. As the inapposite authorities Putative Intervenors cite \nin their motion make clear, an attempt to intervene at this stage is unusual indeed. \nAnd  it  bears  repeating  that  “[a]  person  may  not  intervene  as  of  right  in  a \n‘jurisdictionally or procedurally defective’ suit.” Sommers v. Bank of Am., N.A., 835 \nF.3d 509, 513 n.5 (5th Cir. 2016) (quoting Truvillion v. King's Daughters Hosp., 614 \nF.2d 520, 526 (5th Cir. 1980)). \n11 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 133   Filed 01/10/20   Page 12 of 13\nB. Permissive Intervention is also inappropriate here. \n \nRule 24 also authorizes permissive intervention. The portion of the Rule upon \nwhich Putative Intervenors rely provides, in relevant part: “On timely motion, the \ncourt may permit anyone to intervene who has a claim or defense that shares with \nthe main action a common question of law or fact.” FED. R. CIV. P. 24(b)(1)(B). But a \nfinding that a motion for intervention as of right is untimely applies equally to a \nmotion for permissive intervention. Lucas v. McKeithen, 102 F.3d 171, 173 (5th Cir. \n1996). Thus, for the same reasons intervention of right is untimely, permissive \nintervention is also untimely. See supra, Part A. \nCONCLUSION AND PRAYER \nThe Court should dismiss the motion to intervene for lack of subject-matter \njurisdiction. In the alternative, the motion should be denied as untimely. \nRespectfully submitted, \n \nKEN PAXTON \nAttorney General of Texas \n \nJEFFREY C.

U.S; DISTRICT \nWESTERN DIS  EXAS \nJARROD STRINGER, et. al. \nCIVIL NO. SA-16-CA-257-OG \nV. \nROLANDO PABLOS, in his official \ncapacity as Texas Secretary of State \nand STEVEN C. McCRAW, in his official \ncapacity as Director of the Texas Department \nof Public Safety \nORDER \nPending before the Court is Plaintiffs' Motion for Summary Judgment (docket no. 77) \nand also Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment (docket no. 82). The parties have filed \nresponses (docket nos. 85, 88) and replies (docket nos. 87, 89). The Court has reviewed the \nrecord and the applicable law, and finds that Plaintiffs' motion should be granted and \nDefendants' motion should be denied. \nI. \nStatement of the case \nThis case concerns Texas's compliance with the National Voter Registration Act \n(NVRA) (also known as the \"motor voter law\"), 52 U.S.C.  20501, et. seq., which was enacted \n§ \nin 1993 under the Elections Clause to make the voter registration process easier and more \nconvenient, thus increasing voter registration and participation.' The only six states exempt from \n'See 52 U.S.C. § 2050 1(b)(l) (\"to establish procedures that will increase the number of \neligible citizens who register to vote\"). \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 105   Filed 05/10/18   Page 2 of 61\nits requirements are those that have no voter registration or allow election day voter registration \nat the polls.2 Texas is not one of them.3 \nII. \nApplicable standard \nSummary judgment is proper when the evidence shows \"there is no genuine dispute as to \nany material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" FED. R. CIV. P. \n56(a); Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 250-52 (1986). Rule 56 \"mandates the \nentry of summary judgment, after adequate time for discovery and upon motion, against a party \nwho fails..  to establish the existence of an element essential to that party's case, and on which \n. \nthat party will bear the burden of proof at trial.\" Curtis v. Anthony, 710 F.3d 587, 594 (5th Cir. \n2013) (quoting Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322 (1986)). \nThe Court must draw reasonable inferences and construe evidence in favor of the \nnonmoving party. Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587 (1986). \nAlthough the evidence is viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, a \nnonmovant may not rely on \"conclusory allegations, unsubstantiated assertions, or only a scintilla \nof evidence\" to create a genuine issue of material fact sufficient to survive summary judgment. \nFreeman v.  Tex. Dep 't of Criminal Justice, 369 F.3d 854, 860 (5th Cir. 2004). \nIII. \nThe claims, defenses, and underlying facts \nPlaintiffs are eligible Texas voters who engaged in NVRA-covered online driver's license \ntransactions but were denied simultaneous voter registration applications and thereafter \n252 U.S.C.  20503(b) \n§ \n3See https://www.justice.gov/crt/national-voter-registration-act- 1 993-nvra \n2 \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 105   Filed 05/10/18   Page 3 of 61\ndisenfranchised. They assert that the State of Texas, by and through the Department of Public \nSafety and the Secretary of State, engages in a practice that deprives Texans of their federal right \nto register to vote or update their voter registration simultaneously with their online driver's \nlicense renewal and change of address transactions. Plaintiffs allege that this practice, dating \nback several years, violates the NVRA and Equal Protection clause. Although advised of the \nviolation, and admittedly able to change its practice and procedure, the State of Texas has refused \nto integrate voter registration into its online driver's license renewal and change of address \nprocess to ensure compliance with federal law. \nPlaintiffs seek summary judgment on their claims that Defendants' online process \nviolates the NVRA and Equal Protection clause. They also seek summary judgment on \nDefendants' affirmative defenses, including immunity, standing, and mootness. \nDefendants admit that the key facts of this case are undisputed4 and essentially argue that \nstate law prevents them from complying with federal law. Defendants seek summary judgment \non the following grounds: Article III standing, statutory standing, mootness, and on the merits \nbased on their interpretation of the NYRA, state election law, and the Equal Protection clause. \nThe parties have stipulated to the following facts: \n1.  Defendant Rolando Pablos is the Texas Secretary of State (\"SOS\") and, under Texas \nElection Code §31.001(a), serves as the State's Chief Election Officer. \n4The Court has taken judicial notice of the evidence attached to Plaintiffs' Request for \nJudicial Notice (docket no. 93). Defendants did not oppose the Court taking judicial notice of the \nofficial government web pages cited in the order. Defendants did question the relevancy of \nexhibit A-6, which is simply a hard copy of screen shots that may be found on the official \ngovernment website in question. The Court considered the screen shots in exhibit A-6 that are \nrelevant to the issues herein and consistent with the undisputed evidence in the record. Many of \nthe documents attached to Plaintiffs' Request for Judicial Notice are in other parts of the record \nwith no objection thereto. \n3 \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 105   Filed 05/10/18   Page 4 of 61\n2.  Defendant Steven C. McCraw is the Director of the Texas Department of Public Safety \n(\"DPS\"). DPS operates offices around the State and issues Texas driver's licenses. All \nreferences to \"driver's licenses\" herein refer to Texas driver's licenses issued by DPS. \n3.  DPS is responsible for transmitting information to SOS about eligible driver's license \napplicants who  during covered driver's license transactions with DPS  indicate they \nwish to (1) register to vote, or (2) update their voter registration information. This \ninformation is transmitted by DPS to SOS in the voter registration extract file. \n4.  Plaintiffs Jarrod Stringer, Benjamin Hemandez, and John 0. Woods, III (collectively, \n\"Plaintiffs\") changed their addresses on their DPS-issued driver's licenses through online \ntransactions on Texas.gov. \n5.  Plaintiffs' counsel sent the Secretary of State letters dated May 27, 2015, October 23, \n2015, and November 18, 2015, describing the change of address transactions in paragraph \n4, and stating their allegation that DPS's and SOS's handling of these transactions \nviolated the National Voter Registration Act. \n6.  Among other requirements, an applicant must be a U.S. citizen to be eligible to renew his \ndriver's license or change the address on his driver's license online. \n7.  An applicant completing an online transaction to renew his driver's license must enter his \ndriver's license number, date of birth, the last four digits of his social security number, \nand the audit number on his driver's license. \n8.  An applicant completing an online transaction to change the address on his driver's \nlicense  or an applicant who changes the address on his driver's license when renewing \nit online  must enter his driver's license number, date of birth, the last four digits of his \nsocial security number, the audit number on his driver's license, his home address (street, \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 105   Filed 05/10/18   Page 5 of 61\ncity,  state, zip code, and county) and, if different than his home address, his mailing \naddress (street, city, state, zip code, county, and country). \n9.  The voter registration application on the SOS voter website is found here: \nhttps://webservices.sos.state.tx.us/vrapp/index.asp \n10.  Between April 2013 and February 26, 2016, Step 5 of the online renewal and change of \naddress interface prompted the applicant to select \"yes\" or \"no\" beneath the statement \"I \nwant to register to vote. Selecting 'yes' does not register you to vote. A link to the [SOS] \nvoter website (where a voter application may be downloaded or requested) will be \navailable on your receipt page.\" (emphasis original) \n11.  The signature that appears on the license generated as a result of a customer's online \ndriver's license renewal or change of address transaction is an image of the applicant's \nphysical signature, electronically captured during the applicant's most recent in-person \ntransaction in a DPS field office. (On the DL-14A and DL-43 forms this is referred to as \nthe applicant's \"electronic signature\") \n12.  Plaintiffs did not submit a change of address that relates to a Texas driver's license in \nperson during the change of address transactions that form the basis of Plaintiffs' claims \nin this lawsuit. \n13.  Plaintiffs did not submit a change of address that relates to a Texas driver's license by \nmail during the change of address transactions that form the basis of Plaintiffs' claims in \nthis lawsuit. \n14.  Plaintiffs did not complete a voter registration application on the Secretary of State's \nwebsite through the link provided on the receipt page at the end of the change of address \ntransactions that form the basis of Plaintiffs' claims in this lawsuit. \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 105   Filed 05/10/18   Page 6 of 61\n15.  After receiving the letters described in Stipulation 5, Defendants offered, through \nPlaintiffs' attorneys, to confirm Plaintiffs' voter registration status and provide assistance \nin updating their voter registration if they desired. \n16.  Plaintiffs did not attempt to renew their Texas driver's license online during the change of \naddress transactions that form the basis of Plaintiffs' claims in this lawsuit. \n17.  Plaintiffs are currently registered to vote in the counties where in the letters referenced in \nStipulation 5 each Plaintiff indicated they wished to be registered. \n18.  Plaintiff Jarrod Stringer did not attempt to cast a ballot in the federal general election in \n2012. \n19.  Plaintiff Jarrod Stringer was able to cast a ballot in the 2016 federal general election. \n20.  Plaintiff John Woods was able to cast a ballot in the 2012 and 2016 federal general \nelections. \n21.  Plaintiff Benjamin Hernandez was able to cast a ballot in the 2012 and 2016 federal \ngeneral elections. \n22.  There were no special federal elections in Texas in 2013 and 2015. \n(Docket no. 94, Exh. A). \nThe record reflects the following additional facts. Although these facts are not stipulated, \nthey are generally undisputed: \nEach named Plaintiff moved within Texas, changed his driver's license address using the \nonline driver's license renewal and change-of-address website,5 indicated \"yes\" in response to the \n5The official website for the State of Texas, referred to as Texas.gov, was established for \nDPS and other state agencies to \"put their services online\" and provides \"easy access to \ngovernment information and.  secure online services.  through a public-private partnership \n.  .  .  . \nbetween the State of Texas and Texas NICUSA,.  the nation's leading provider of official \n.  . \ngovernment portals, online services, and secure payment processing solutions.\" Docket no. 93-6, \np.11. \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 105   Filed 05/10/18   Page 7 of 61\nprompt \"I want to register to vote,\" but was not registered to vote. Each Plaintiff was prevented \nfrom fully exercising his fundamental right to vote in a subsequent election due to his outdated \nvoter registration record. \nBenjamin Hernandez had been a registered voter in Ector County, Texas since the age of \n18. He retired from his job with the City of Odessa in February 2013 and moved to Dallas \nCounty. He went online to change his driver's license address. After inputting his information, \nMr. Hernandez checked \"yes\" to the voter registration question and believed his voter \nregistration would be updated and he would thereafter be registered to vote in Dallas County. On \nelection day in 2014, Mr. Hernandez attempted to vote but was told his name was not on the rolls \nin Dallas County. He was allowed to cast a provisional ballot but later received notice that his \nvote was not counted because he was not registered to vote in Dallas County. See docket no. 94- \n4, deposition of B. Hemandez, at 16:11-17, 21-24; 18:6-12; 19:2-8, 21-22; 27:18-20; 28:2-6, 16- \n25; 29:1-2, 8-11; 32:2-6, 17-22; 34:8-11, 23-25; 37:1-13. See also docket no. 77,  appx.149-165. \nDr. John Woods III changed his residence from Travis County to Harris County in June \n2015. He went online to change his driver's license address. After inputting his identifying \ninformation, he checked the box to register to vote. By checking \"yes,\" Dr. Woods believed his \nvoter registration had been updated with the new address. But that did not happen. On election \nday in 2015, Dr. Woods called Harris County to identify his polling location. He was told that he \nwas still registered in Travis County, rather than Harris County, and any provisional ballot cast in \nHarris County would likely not be counted. Dr. Woods went to the polling location anyway, cast \nhis vote, and was later informed in writing that his provisional ballot was not counted. See docket \nno. 94-6, deposition of John Woods, at 22:8-13; 25:16-25; 26:1-5; 52:7-25; 53:1-6; 62:3-6; 63:3- \n25; 64:1-15; 65:1-9; 66:6-11. See also docket no. 77, appx. 188-204. \n7 \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 105   Filed 05/10/18   Page 8 of 61\nJarrod Stringer moved from Tarrant to Bexar County and sought to change his address for \ndriver's license and voter registration purposes. He thought that the DPS website would enable \nhim to change his voter registration at the same time he changed his driver's license. Mr. Stringer \nwent online and input all the requested information. There was a box he could check if he wanted \nto register to vote and he did so. Mr. Stringer believed he had \"done the necessary steps to \nbecome a registered voter in Bexar County.\" He then attempted to vote in November 2014 and \nwas told by poll workers that his name was not on the rolls. Mr. Stringer called Bexar County \nand was told he could vote only for statewide elections because he wasn't registered to vote in \nBexar County. See docket no. 94-5, deposition of J. Stringer, at 15:8-24; 16:16-25; 17:1-5; 31:1- \n5, 19-24; 32:16-33:1; 45:7-46:22; 47:8-17. See also docket no. 77, appx. 167-186. \nPlaintiffs' testimony regarding their personal experiences with DPS's online process is \nconsistent with the testimony of State officials and employees with knowledge of how the \nprocess worked in the past and how it currently works. DPS operates offices around the State and \nissues driver's licenses and other state identification cards. DPS is also a designated voter \nregistration agency, pursuant to 52 U.S.C.  20506. DPS's in-person driver's license applications \n§ \n(DL-14A),6 in-person renewal/replacement/change of address forms (DL-43),7 and mail-in \nchange of address forms (DL-64)8 currently serve as simultaneous voter registration applications \nas required under the NVRA.9 However, DPS has not integrated voter registration into its online \nprocess for driver's license renewal and change of address; thus, the driver's license application \n6Docket no. 93, exh.

The form will also inform the applicant that the applicant's \n.  . \nelectronic signature provided to the department will be used for submitting the applicant's voter \nregistration application.\" Docket no. 77, appx. 30 (emphasis added).1' The implementation plan \nfurther states that the \"department will use a change of address form and procedure that combines \ndepartment and voter registration functions. The change of address form submitted in person will \nallow a licensee or cardholder to indicate whether the change of address is also to be used for \nregistration purposes.\" Id. (emphasis added). On \"[e]ach weekday the Department is regularly \nopen for business, the Department will electronically transfer to the Secretary of State (SOS) the \nname and relevant data regarding each applicant who is of voting age and a United States citizen \nwho affirmatively answered the voter registration question.\" Docket no. 77, appx. 31  (emphasis \nadded). This plan was implemented after the enactment of the NVRA and confirms Texas's \n'°The process for driver's license change of address and renewal is \"combined online \nit's one system interface.\"  Docket no. 94-12, deposition of S.

Schonhoff further explained: \nQ: So DLS is the diver's license system, correct? \nA: That's what I understand, right. \nQ: And how does that system function within that process, the transfer process? \nA: It's my understanding that when the operator enters an application into the DLS \nsystem and indicates that a person wants to be a registered voter, that information is then \nwarehoused, if you will, at the State, and every night the State groups up those \napplications and send them  well, we get them as a single file. So depending on  for the \nDPS applications, I think we actually go pull  they produce the file, and then we go pull \nit and process it through our system on a daily basis. \nQ: What do you mean by \"our system\"? \nA: I'm sorry, the voter registration system, the team database system where we actually \npart the addresses and give that information out to the voter registrars of the county. \n(Docket no. 94-7, deposition of B.

It's used for the signature that's required in the \nTexas Election Code. You read me the section. Is that right? \nA: That's right. \nQ: What's the ink signature on the DPS's physical forms used for as far as voter \nregistration? \nA: I don't know. I don't know if it's used for anything. Once they've applied in person at \nthe office, they've signed it electronically. \n*  *  * \nQ: On the. .  . driver's license fonns. .  . it says, \"By providing my electronic signature, I \nunderstand the personal information on my application form and my electronic signature \nwill be used for submitting my voter registration application to the Secretary of State's \nOffice.\" Correct? \nA: That's what it says. \nOkay.

Back to your point about the online transactions not containing a signature, the \nDPS does use the prior provided electronic signature that  for the driver's license that \nthey  the customer used  provided the last time they were in person. Correct? \nA: Presumably, yes. \nQ: The same goes for the mail-in change of address transaction  are you looking at your \ndriver's license there? \nA: Yeah. Because this one was renewed online, and so I guess that I wrote that signature \nat their signature capture device quite a while ago. \nQ: For the mail-in change of address form that.  DPS receives that has the voter \n.  . \nregistration question, there is not an electronic signature or a  use your phrase  the \nphysical signature provided on a keypad provided for that change of address interaction. \nCorrect? \nA: No. There's a physical signature on the  on the address change application. \nQ: Right. But the information that gets sent on to the voter registrars through the \nSecretary of State's Office is the data that's pulled from that form and then the electronic \nsignature that was previously provided by the customer in person at a DPS office? \nA: That's my understanding, yes. \nQ: Well, is that the Secretary of State's understanding? \nA: That is the Secretary of State's understanding. You bet. \nDocketno. 94-11, appx. 39, 42, depositionofK.

The ink signature is never sent to the Secretary of State, correct? \nA: That is correct. \n*  *  * \nQ: Does anyone go through and compare these two? \nA: Not typically, no. \n*  *  * \nQ: Okay. So then the mail-in signatures are never compared [with the stored electronic \nsignatures]. \nA: During the routine process, it would never be compared. .. . When I say \"routine \nprocess,\" what I'm talking about is the individual that's processing that mail renewal \napplication, they would never compare that signature. \nDocket no. 77, appx. 69, deposition of S. Gipson, at 203:19-204:7; appx. 79 at 234:25-235:1; \n236:19-237:9. \nBecause preexisting electronic signatures, rather than signatures on paper, are used for \npaper (in-person and mail-in) renewal and change of address transactions, it would seem logical \nthat preexisting electronic signatures would be used for paperless (online) transactions. Yet \nDefendants claim that, under Texas law, renewal and change of address transactions performed \nonline require a signature on paper for voter registration purposes. As Mr. Ingram testified: \n14 \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 105   Filed 05/10/18   Page 15 of 61\nQ: So in that same way, the online transaction could utilize the previously provided \nelectronic signature that was provided in person by the customer for the voter registration \napplication form that gets to the voter registrar in the same way that the change of address \nmail-in occurs? \nA: It could if the law allowed it, but the law doesn't allow it, so it can't. \nQ: What portion of the [Texas] law doesn't allow it? \nA: 13.002(b). \nDocket no. 94-11, deposition of K. Ingram, at 97:15-24; docket no. 77, appx. 42. \nBecause Defendants assert that Texas law requires a signature on paper, and a signature on paper \nduring a paperless transaction is not possible, Defendants essentially claim they should be \nexcused from compliance with the NVRA when it comes to online renewal and change of \naddress \ntransactions.19 \nPrior to 2013, a motor voter who engaged in an online/paperless transaction for a driver's \nlicense renewal or change of address would provide the same in-depth identifying information \nrequired for an in-person or mail-in transaction, but when reaching the question of whether he \nwould like to register to vote or update his voter information, checking the \"yes\" box would \nautomatically default to \"no.\" Thus, while the user may have been led to believe that his \"yes\" \nanswer would result in updating his voter information, and there was the appearance of \ncompliance with the NVRA, there was never an intent on the part of DPS or SOS to actually \nupdate the voter registration information. Thus, the answer to the question regarding voter \n'9As Ms. Gipson explained, for online transactions, Texas has decided that a previously \ncaptured electronic signature is sufficient for driver's license purposes, but they've refused to \naccept the same electronic signature for voter registration purposes. Docket no. 77, appx. 70, \ndeposition of S. Gipson, at 215:21-216:7. \n15 \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 105   Filed 05/10/18   Page 16 of 61\nregistration was completely meaningless. SOS was aware of the NVRA requirements. SOS was \nalso aware that the online voter registration question, programmed to automatically default to \n\"no,\" was completely meaningless.2° As Mr. Ingram testified: \nQ: Why is there a voter registration question on the online DPS transaction  application? \nExcuse me. \nA: Well, I imagine it's because of Section 5 of the National Voter Registration Act of \nIvIJ \nQ: Could you elaborate on that a little bit? \nA: Sure. The National Voter Registration Act of 1993 required that motor vehicle \nagencies, in our case the DPS, whenever a person has a driver's license transaction \ndriver's license transaction, that they should simultaneously offer the right  the ability to \nupdate their voter registration or register to vote for the first time. That's why the NVRA \nis called the Motor Voter law. \n*  *  * \nQ: Okay. So in  back in 2012, the Secretary of State's office was aware that the answer \nto the \"do you want to register to vote\" question online was defaulting to no. Is that \ncorrect? \nA: Right. \nQ: Was there any  any discussion at that point with the Department of Public Safety to \nto make that change? \n200r worse, it could have led to voter registration data being purged. Legislative history \nsuggests that a key concern when enacting the NVRA was abuse of the purging efforts, so \nCongress specifically prevented states from removing voters from the rolls for failure to vote or \nfailure to respond to a change-of-address notification. See H.R. Rep. No. 103-9, at 16 (1993), \nreprinted in 1993 U.S.C.C.A.N. 105, 120. \n16 \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 105   Filed 05/10/18   Page 17 of 61\nA: Not that I recall. \nDocket no. 77, appx. 40-41, deposition of K. Ingram at 62:4-17; 84:24-85:8. \nAs explained in Mr. Ingram's deposition, the automatic default to \"no\" for voter \nregistration was the subject of a 2012 complaint by an unidentified motor voter. Docket no. 77, \nappx. 41, deposition of K. Ingram at 83:15-85:3. sos responded: \"That is something we can \ndiscuss with DPS in the future.\" Docket no. 77, appx. 41, deposition of K. Ingram at 84:16-18. \nMr. Ingram did not recall any subsequent discussions. After some passage of time, DPS did \nremove the automatic default to \"no.\" Docket no. 77, appx. 41, deposition of K. Ingram at 82:7- \n13. \nThereafter, until February 27, 2016, Step 5 of the online renewal and change of address \ninterface was changed to prompt the applicant to select \"yes\" or \"no\" beneath the statement \"I \nwant to register to vote.\" It no longer defaulted to \"no,\" but selecting \"yes\" did not provide a \nsimultaneous voter application. Instead, it gave the user a link to the SOS voter registration \nwebsite for a completely separate application process. Docket no. 77, appx. 118, admission no. 7. \nAfter February 27, 2016, Step 5 of the online renewal and change of address interface was \nchanged to prompt the applicant to select \"yes\" or \"no\" to answer the question \"Do you want to \nrequest a voter application?\" Docket no. 77, appx. 118, admission 8, 9. While the online process \ncurrently accepts a \"yes\" answer to the voter application  question, the transaction still ends there. \nThe user is still not provided a simultaneous application for voter registration purposes. Instead, \nwhen a user responds with a \"yes\" answer to the voter application question, the user is simply \ngiven a website link to the SOS office.2' See Stipulation no.  10, p. 5, supra. If the user goes to the \n21See Docket no. 77, appx. 45, deposition of K.

For \nan out-of-county change of address, the application must be retrieved, printed, filled out, and \nmailed or delivered in person to the county registrar in order to update the voter registration. The \napplication seeks the same information required by DPS for an online driver's license change of \naddress but the motor voter must go through a completely different governmental entity (SOS) \nwith a completely separate application process.23 Thus, it is indisputable that the online DPS \nrenewal/change of address transaction and SOS voter registration transaction are not \nsimultaneous, but rather entirely separate application procedures conducted through separate \nagencies.24 If the motor voter does not take these extra steps  go to the SOS website, request an \n22See docket no. 77, appx. 78, deposition of S.

Yet SOS admits that it uses previously stored electronic signatures for all \nvoter registration applications that originate with DPS regardless of whether those applications \nare paper transactions. As Betsy Schonhoff testified: \nQ: The signature that Secretary of State is currently using for voter registration \napplications is an electronic signature that is provided when a person goes in person to a \nDPS office; is that right? \nA: When they are  when they are in the application file, you mean? \nQ: Yes, the voter registration application. \nA: Yes, It's what they have signed on that signature pad. That's my understanding. \nQ: Turning your attention to the mail-in change of address.  You acknowledge that the \nSecretary of State does receive voter registration applications from change of address \nmail-ins that DPS processes; is that correct? \nA: That's correct. \nQ: Yes. \nA: It is my understanding they treat in-person just like  mail just the same as in person. \nQ: But the mail-in  correct me if! am wrong  the mail-in address to the application for \nupdate with DPS, the signature that's on that form is not extracted and somehow the \n19 \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 105   Filed 05/10/18   Page 20 of 61\nSecretary of State gets access to it; is that correct? \nA: That's my understanding. \nQ:  It is your understanding that the current law requires a signature for the voter \n.  . . \nregistration application.  Do I have that right? \nQ: The mail-in forms that you all are getting information from, from DPS, uses the prior \nprovided electronic signature from that customer; is that right? \nA: That's my understanding. \nDocket no. 94-7, deposition of B. Schonhoff, at 195:18-196:25. \nDefendants also stipulate that DPS uses electronic signatures for all online driver's \nlicense renewal or change of address transactions. Docket no. 94, Stipulation 11 (\"The signature \nthat appears on the license generated as a result of a customer's online driver's license renewal or \nchange of address transaction is an image of the applicant's physical signature, electronically \ncaptured during the applicant's most recent in-person transaction in a DPS field office (On the \nDL-  4A and DL-43 forms this is referred to as the applicant's 'electronic signature')\") \n1 \nDefendants admit that they even use electronic signatures for driver's license transactions \nconducted over the telephone.

U.S. \nCONST. art. 1, § 4, cl. 1. Specifically, Congress found that \n(1) the right of citizens of the United States to vote is a fundamental right; \n(2)  it is the duty of the Federal, State, and local governments to promote the exercise of \nthat right; and \n(3)  discriminatory and unfair registration laws and procedures can have a direct and \ndamaging effect on voter participation in elections for Federal office and \ndisproportionately harm voter participation by various groups, including racial minorities. \n52 U.S.C.  2050 1(a)(1)-(3). \n§ \nThe stated purposes of the Act are \n(1) to establish procedures that will increase the number of eligible citizens who register \nto vote in elections for Federal office; \nwhich is not compared with the electronic signature, not used for DPS purposes, and not \nforwarded to SOS for voter registration purposes. \n23 \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 105   Filed 05/10/18   Page 24 of 61\n(2) to make it possible for Federal, State, and local governments to implement this \nchapter in a manner that enhances the participation of eligible citizens as voters in \nelections for Federal office; \n(3) to protect the integrity of the electoral process; and \n(4) to ensure that accurate and current voter registration rolls are maintained. \n52 U.S.C.  20501(b)(1)-(4). \n§ \nBased on these findings and for these stated purposes, Congress imposed national \nprocedures for voter registration for elections for federal office as follows: \n(a) In general \nExcept as provided in subsection (b), notwithstanding any other Federal or State law, in \naddition to any other method of voter registration provided for under State law, each State \nshall establish procedures to register to vote in elections for Federal office \n(1) by application made simultaneously with an application for a motor vehicle driver's \nlicense pursuant to section 20504 of this title; \n(2) by mail application pursuant to section 20505 of this title; and \n(3) by application in person \n(A) at the appropriate registration site designated with respect to the residence of the \napplicant in accordance with State law; and \n(B) at a Federal, State, or nongovernmental office designated under section 20506 of this \ntitle. \n52 U.S.C.  20503 (emphasis added). \n§ \nSection 20504 specifically describes the requirements for a simultaneous application for \nvoter registration and motor vehicle driver's license: \n24 \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 105   Filed 05/10/18   Page 25 of 61\n(a) In general \n(1) Each State motor vehicle driver's license application (including any renewal \napplication) submitted to the appropriate State motor vehicle authority under State law \nshall serve as an application for voter registration with respect to elections for Federal \noffice unless the applicant fails to sign the voter registration application. \n(2) An application for voter registration submitted under paragraph (1) shall be \nconsidered as updating any previous voter registration by the applicant. \n*  *  * \n(c) Forms and procedures \n(1) Each State shall include a voter registration application form for elections for Federal \noffice as part of an application for a State motor vehicle driver's license \n(2) The voter registration application portion of an application for a State motor vehicle \ndriver's license \n(A) may not require any information that duplicates information required in the driver 's \nlicense portion of the form (other than a second signature or other information necessary \nunder subparagraph (C)); \n(B) may require only the minimum amount of information necessary to \n(i) prevent duplicate voter registrations; and \n(ii) enable State election officials to assess the eligibility of the applicant and to \nadminister voter registration and other parts of the election process; \n(C) shall include a statement that \n(i) states each eligibility requirement (including citizenship); \n(ii) contains an attestation that the applicant meets each such requirement; and \n25 \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 105   Filed 05/10/18   Page 26 of 61\n(iii) requires the signature of the applicant, under penalty of perjury;

Statutory standing/notice \nDefendants claim that Plaintiffs lack statutory standing for failure to comply with the \nnotice provision in the NYRA, 52 U.S.C.  20510. On May 27, 2015, Plaintiffs' counsel sent a \n§ \nnotice letter on behalf of Benjamin Hernandez and others explaining in detail the applicable law, \nthe NVRA violation made the basis of this lawsuit, and why the complainants believed their \nrights were being violated. Docket no. 77, appx. 2. On October 23, 2015, Plaintiffs' counsel sent \na supplemental notice letter on behalf of Jarrod Stringer, explaining how the continuing violation \naffected him and urging correction and compliance. Docket no. 77, appx. 23. On November 18, \n2015, a second supplemental notice letter was sent on behalf of Dr. Woods, explaining his \nexperience and urging compliance with NVRA mandates and correction of the continuing \nviolations with online transactions. Docket no. 77, appx. 26. Defendants refer to the letters as \n\"purported notice\" and claim that Plaintiffs \"have not complied with the NVRA's mandatory \nnotice provision.\" Docket no. 82, pp. 2, 11. But Defendants do not explain why the letters should \nbe considered ineffective for notice purposes. The statute merely requires that \"a person who is \n27 \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 105   Filed 05/10/18   Page 28 of 61\naggrieved by a violation of this chapter may provide written notice of the violation.\" 52 U.S.C. \n§ \n2051 0(b)( 1).  This requirement has been satisfied. \nIn response to the notice letters, the parties exchanged several written communications \nover a six month period, met in person, and attempted to work out the non-compliance issues \nraised in the notice  Plaintiffs did ultimately get registered to vote, but Defendants \nletters.27 \ndisagreed with Plaintiffs about what the NVRA requires and refused to take the steps that \nPlaintiffs contend are required by the NVRA to cure the underlying violations. Plaintiffs filed \nthis lawsuit on March 14, 2016, more than 90 days after receipt of notice and an opportunity to \ncorrect the violations. Docket no. \nDefendants rely on Scott v. Schedler, 771 F.3d 831 (5th Cir. 2014), for the proposition \nthat they cannot be sued if the aggrieved person is registered to vote within 90 days after notice \nof a violation.29 Neither the NVRA nor the holding in Scott supports this broad proposition, and \nDefendants' argument ignores the underlying violations that occurred when Plaintiffs were not \nprovided simultaneous voter registration applications as required by the NYRA. In the Scott case, \nthe individual plaintiff, Luther Scott, Jr., never sent a notice letter. The NAACP sent a notice \nletter to the Louisiana SOS, but never mentioned Scott. On appeal, Scott admitted that he himself \ndid not provide notice but claimed notice was not required from him personally because the \nNAACP provided notice. Without reaching the merits of Scott's claim, the Fifth Circuit held that \n27Docket no. 77, appx. 99; admission no. 23. \n28More than two years has now passed. The online process has still not changed and \nDefendants have indicated a refusal to make any changes. \n29Docket no. 82, p. 2 (\"Plaintiffs lack statutory standing because it is undisputed that \nfollowing their purported 'notice' letters to the State  Defendants offered their assistance in \nconfirming each Plaintiffs' voter registration and assisting any Plaintiff that wanted to update his \ninformation.\"). \n28 \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 105   Filed 05/10/18   Page 29 of 61\n\"Scott's failure to provide notice is fatal to his suit.\" Scott, 771 F.3d at 836. \nPlaintiffs in this case did not fail to provide notice and Defendants have not corrected the \nviolations made the basis of Plaintiffs' complaint. Defendants' broad assertion  that offering \nregistration assistance after receiving notice excuses the prior/ongoing violation, strips the \nplaintiff of standing, and precludes suit regardless of the nature of the violation  ignores the \nmandates of the NVRA, the facts and holding in the Scott case, and the facts and underlying \nviolations in this  Plaintiffs have complied with the statutory notice requirements and have \ncase.3° \nstanding to pursue their claims under the NVRA.31 \n301n the Scott case, the individual plaintiff (who was intermittently homeless) complained \nthat he was not given a voter registration form when he visited the Louisiana Department of \nChildren and Family Services (LCFS) in person. 771 F.3d at 833. Scott did not give written \nnotice and his claim was dismissed on that basis alone. Id. (\"We dismiss Scott's claim on \nstanding and notice grounds.\"). The LCFS did try to provide Mr. Scott with voter registration \nforms in an attempt to cure the alleged violation which the Fifth Circuit noted, in dicta, was the \nsort of response that pre-litigation notice was meant to encourage. Id. at 836. At the same time, \nthe Fifth Circuit considered the NAACP's claims which alleged violations far broader than the \nnarrow focus of Scott's individual claim and which the defendants had failed to cure after \nreceiving notice. In this case, Plaintiffs have complained that they were deprived of their \nstatutory right to a simultaneous voter registration application during their online transactions \nwith Texas DPS. In other words, Defendants failed to treat their online driver's license \napplications as simultaneous voter registration applications and required them to subsequently \nsubmit duplicate information for voter registration that was separate and apart from information \nsubmitted during their driver's license transactions. See docket no.  1. Defendants were given pre- \nlitigation notice, but the violations in issue  which are rooted in the failure to provide \nsimultaneous voter registration applications during online transactions  have not been cured and \nDefendants have not demonstrated a willingness to cure the violations. See Scoff, 771 F.3d at 836 \n(discussing futility argument when there is no demonstrated desire to comply with the NVRA). \n31Defendants also cite Georgia State Conference v. Kemp, 841 F. Supp. 2d 1320 (N.D. \nGa. 2012) for the proposition that \"attempt[ing] to comply\" with the relevant NVRA provisions \nafter receiving notice, if \"more than an empty gesture,\" precludes litigation. Docket no. 88, pp. 6- \n7. The violation in Kemp was the systemic failure to provide voter registration to persons seeking \npublic assistance. Simultaneous voter registration was honored for persons obtaining a hunting, \nfishing, or trapping license, but not for persons seeking public assistance benefits. The court \nfound that the plaintiffs had stated a viable claim. Moreover, the court found all plaintiffs  with \nthe exception of Mr. Murphy  had complied with the notice provision. \"Murphy's particular \nsituation was not made known to the defendants until they were served with the amended \n29 \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 105   Filed 05/10/18   Page 30 of 61\nB.  Article III standing/mootness \nTo establish Article III standing, a plaintiff must show an \"injury in fact\" that is concrete, \nparticularized, and actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical; that the injury is \"fairly \ntraceable\" to the challenged conduct of the defendant; and that it is likely, not merely speculative, \nthat the injury can be redressed by a favorable decision. Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.s. \n555, 560-61 (1992); Friends of the Earth, Inc. v.  Laidlaw Environmental Services, 528 U.S. 167, \n180-81(2000). Here, Plaintiffs were deprived of their individual right to simultaneous voter \nregistration applications at the time they engaged in the online DPS transactions to change their \ndriver's licenses. Plaintiffs would have been properly registered to vote in time for the following \nelection if Defendants had complied with the NVRA. The violation itself and the resulting \ndisenfranchisement is fairly traceable to Defendants' noncompliance with the NVRA. Plaintiffs \nhave articulated and shown an individualized dispute, rather than a generalized complaint. Court- \nordered compliance with the NYRA would prevent repetition of the same injury to Plaintiffs and \nothers. \nDefendants claim that their offer of assistance in updating Plaintiffs' voter information \ncomplaint.\" 841 F. Supp. 2d at 1335. Thus, Murphy did not have standing. The court did note \nthat Georgia attempted to comply \"with regard to Mr. Murphy\" but that was not the basis for \ndismissal.  Instead, Mr. Murphy's claim was dismissed for failing to comply with the notice \nrequirement. Id. at 1335-36. The court refused to dismiss the remaining claims because the other \nplaintiffs did provide notice, their claims were much broader, and Georgia's \"efforts\" to change \nits practices were insufficient to render the controversy moot. Id. at 1338-39. In this case, \nPlaintiffs have satisfied the notice requirement and Defendants have refused to modify their \npractices. The NVRA plainly states that a violation must be \"corrected,\" not just attempted. 52 \nU.S.C.  2051 0(b)(2). In this case, Plaintiffs were subsequently provided voter registration \n§ \napplications, but they were not provided simultaneous applications as required by the NYRA. \nThe failure to provide Texans with simultaneous applications during online DPS transactions still \npersists. The State has refused to correct the violations made the basis of Plaintiffs' complaint \nand, based on the deposition testimony of SOS and DPS officials, they have no plans to correct \nthe violations being asserted herein. \nIJ \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 105   Filed 05/10/18   Page 31 of 61\nand/or confirming their registration status after the violation renders this controversy moot. But \nDefendants were simply providing the assistance that they are required by law to provide to \nvoters. See 52 U.S.C. § 20506 (a)(4)(A),(6)(c) (A voter registration agency shall provide \nassistance to each applicant in completing voter registration forms unless the applicant refuses \nsuch assistance). And compliance with one provision of the law does not render moot violations \nof other provisions of the law. The underlying violations that form the basis of Plaintiffs' \ncomplaint have not been corrected and continue unabated. The DPS online renewal and change \nof address transactions do not serve as \"simultaneous\" applications for voter registration, in \nviolation of 52 U.S.C.  20503(a)(l), 20504(a)(l); the separate SOS voter registration process is \n§ \nnot \"part of' the DPS online driver's license transaction, as required by 52 U.S.C.  20504(c)(1); \n§ \ninformation required by SOS for a separate voter registration transaction \"duplicates\" the \ninformation required by DPS for an online renewal or change of address transaction, in violation \nof 52 U.S.C.  20504(c)(2)(A); and the online change of address transaction does not \"serve as \n§ \nnotification of change of address for voter registration,\" as required by 52 U.S.C.  20504(d). \n§ \nThese are the violations that form the basis of Plaintiffs' complaint and these violations have not \nbeen corrected despite notice and the ability to do so. \nDefendants' mootness argument also overlooks the two-fold nature of Plaintiffs' cause of \naction. Plaintiffs contend that the State's online process itself is unlawful under the NYRA; thus, \nthey allege not only disenfranchisement, but also a violation of the statutory right to a \nsimultaneous application for both voter registration and driver's license renewal and change of \naddress. Defendants' assertion  that post-notice voter registration assistance effectively cures \nany NVRA violation  ignores the clear mandates of the NVRA. The lack of voter registration \nand resulting disenfranchisement were merely the symptoms of the underlying violation, and \n31 \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 105   Filed 05/10/18   Page 32 of 61\ntreating the symptoms does not cure the underlying violation. Thus, the controversy is not moot \njust because Plaintiffs were ultimately registered to vote. \nDefendants also argue that Plaintiffs' injuries are not redressable and their claims are \nmoot because they were disenfranchised only in past elections and the \"capable of repetition\" \nexception to mootness does not apply because there is not a reasonable expectation that Plaintiffs \nwill be disenfranchised in this manner in the future. Voting-related lawsuits do not become moot \njust because an election has passed.  Ctr. for mdiv. Freedom v. Carmouche, 449 F.3d 655, 662 \n(5th Cir. 2006) (\"Controversy surrounding elections laws.  is one of the paradigmatic \n.  . \ncircumstances in which the Supreme Court has found that full litigation can never be completed \nbefore the precise controversy (a particular election) has run its course.\"). Because this \ncontroversy is not moot, the case does not necessarily turn on the \"capable of repetition\" \nexception to mootness. But this is exactly the type of violation that is capable of repetition yet \nevading review. See Spencer v. Kemna, 523 U.S. 1, 17-18 (1998) (the doctrine applies when the \nchallenged action is in its duration too short to be fully litigated prior to cessation or expiration \nand there is a reasonable expectation that the same complaining party will be subject to the same \naction again). Defendants have refused to change their online process to allow simultaneous \nvoter registration applications. Thus, if these Plaintiffs (or others) were to relocate tomorrow, and \nengage in an online DPS transaction to change their address, they would be deprived of their \nright to simultaneously change their voter registration information. And unless these Plaintiffs (or \nothers) took further steps on their own, which the NVRA protects against, they would be \ndisenfranchised.32 Thus, whether the focus is on these particular Plaintiffs or others, the same \n32The mandates of the NYRA dictate exactly the opposite of what Defendants want \nTexans to do to personally ensure they are registered to vote: engage in a second transaction that \nrequires a separate application with duplicate information and the burden of downloading, \nprinting, and mailing or personal delivery. Congress lifted these burdens to make voter \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 105   Filed 05/10/18   Page 33 of 61\ninjury is likely to occur again. See Carmouche, 449 F.3d at 662 (citing Storer v. Brown, 417 U.s. \n926 (1974) and Dunn v.  Blumstein, 403 U.S. 330 (1972) for the proposition that a case is not \nmoot if other individuals will be affected by the action being challenged). When a controversy is \ntruly moot, there is nothing left to remedy. In this case, Defendants' noncompliance with the \nNVRA has continued unabated, and although resulting disenfranchisement may cease prior to a \nremedy, the challenged action continues. \nDefendants further argue that Plaintiffs have failed to establish Article III standing \nbecause their injuries stem from their own failure to take the extra steps to print, complete, and \nmail paper voter registration forms through SOS as instructed in their online driver's license \ntransactions with DPS. The irony of this argument does not go unnoticed. In sum, Defendants \nclaim that Plaintiffs and others should never have Article III standing to sue for the State's \nnoncompliance with the NVRA if they do not follow the State registration process that allegedly \nviolates the NVRA. As Plaintiffs explained in their deposition testimony, they believed their \nchange of address transaction for driver's license purposes also served to update their voter \nregistration. They showed up at the polls to vote in the following election only to discover that \ntheir registration had not been updated. Even if they did not complete the SOS registration \nprocess (which they believed they had done), the failure to complete the extra steps put in place \nby the State does not strip them of Article III standing to pursue a claim under federal law. \nNothing in the NVRA requires Plaintiffs or others to exhaust a state process before pursuing a \nfederal claim  especially when the state process itself is alleged to violate the federal law being \nenforced. \nregistration easier, yet Defendants ignore the NVRA mandate and impose requirements which \nresult in disenfranchisement if voters do not jump through all the hoops. \n33 \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 105   Filed 05/10/18   Page 34 of 61\nDefendants rely upon the holding of the Fifth Circuit in Westfall v. Miller, 77 F.3d 868 \n(5th Cir. 1996). In that case, the court found a lack of standing because the plaintiff was \nchallenging a federal requirement that he obtain law enforcement certification before being \npermitted to purchase a machine gun and he unsuccessfully sought certification from some, but \nnot all, of the officials who could provide it. Id. at 871. Westfall is distinguishable because the \nplaintiff therein was challenging a federal regulation that required a specific process. In this case, \nPlaintiffs are not challenging the NVRA; they are seeking to enforce it. And the state process that \nPlaintiffs are challenging is not a federal process that the NVRA requires. Instead, the NVRA \nmandates against the state process. Again, Defendants' argument that Plaintiffs are responsible \nfor their own injury because they failed to complete the State's registration process overlooks \nPlaintiffs' claim that the State's registration process is itself unlawful, and thus they allege not \nonly disenfranchisement, but also a violation of their federal right to \"[s]imultaneous application \nfor voter registration and  driver's license[.]\" 52 U.S.C.  20504. This statutory injury \n. .  .  § \nremains cognizable regardless of whether Plaintiffs completed the state registration process that \nthey challenge under federal law. See Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins, 136 S.Ct. 1540, 1549 (2016), as \nrevised (May 24, 2016) (\"Congress has the power to define injuries and articulate chains of \ncausation that will give rise to a case or controversy where none existed before.\"); Wendt v. 24 \nHour Fitness USA, Inc., 821 F.3d 547, 552 (5th Cir. 2016) (\"[t]he actual or threatened injury \nrequired by Art. III may exist solely by virtue of statutes creating legal rights, the invasion of \nwhich creates standing.\"); ACORNv. Fowler, 178 F.3d 350, 363 (5th Cir. 1999) (the NVRA's \nprivate right of action \"extend[s] standing under the Act to the maximum allowable under the \nConstitution\"); Arcia v. Florida Sec 'y of State, 772 F.3d 1335, 1341 (11th Cir. 2014) (\"Even \nthough they were ultimately not prevented from voting, an injury like theirs [being erroneously \nidentified as a non-citizen and removed from the voter rolls] is sufficient to confer standing.\"); \n34 \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 105   Filed 05/10/18   Page 35 of 61\nCommon Cause/Georgia v. Billups, 554 F.3d 1340, 1351 (11th Cir. 2009) (\"A plaintiff need not \nhave the franchise wholly denied to suffer injury.\"). \nC.  Dr. Woods' standing \nDefendants also claim that Dr. Woods does not have standing individually to pursue a \nclaim under the NVRA because he was disenfranchised only in the 2015 election and the ballot \ndid not include any federal contests.33 This standing argument against Dr. Woods individually \nmay present a closer question than the standing challenges against Plaintiffs collectively. In \nBroyles v.  Texas, 618 F. Supp. 2d 661, 690-92 (S.D. Tex. 2009) the district court found the \nNVRA inapplicable because the plaintiffs therein complained about irregularities in a municipal \nspecial purpose election. The plaintiffs in Broyles did not allege or present \"any evidence of \nregistration problems that affected their right to vote in a federal election or on any issue beyond \nthe [municipal] incorporation issue.\"  Id.  Although the Broyles court found that the NVRA did \nnot apply, it did explain that even if the NVRA did apply to municipal registration issues, the \nplaintiffs therein did not satisfy the prerequisite notice requirement.  Id. at 691. They waited until \nafter the municipal incorporation vote and then simply filed suit.  618 F. Supp. 2d 691 (\"the \n'notice' came in the form of a Summons and Original Complaint\"). \nThe Court believes that deciding this issue based on whether a subsequent election is state \nor federal and whether the plaintiff was disenfranchised in whole or in part is inconsistent with \ntraditional notions of standing. First, the NVRA' s private right of action \"extend[s] standing \nunder the Act to the maximum allowable under the Constitution.\" ACORN v. Fowler, 178 F.3d at \n363. Second, the presence of one party with standing is sufficient to satisfy Article III. Rumsfeld \nv. Forum for Academic & Institutional Rights, Inc., 547 U.S. 47, 52 n. 2 (2006); Texas v. US., \n331t is undisputed that both Stringer and Hernandez were disenfranchised in 2014, a \nfederal election year. Thus, although Defendants repeatedly refer to \"Plaintiffs\" in making this \nargument, it applies only to Dr. Woods. \n35 \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 105   Filed 05/10/18   Page 36 of 61\n787 F.3d 733, 747 (5th Cir. 2015). Third, a threat of impending injury is sufficient to satisfy \nArticle III standing. See Wendt, 821 F.3d at 552 (\"[t]he actual or threatened injury required by \nArt. III may exist solely by virtue of statutes creating legal rights, the invasion of which creates \nstanding\"). Here, Plaintiffs have presented undisputed evidence of violations and immediate \ninjury (a failure to provide simultaneous applications for voter registration) that occurred at the \ntime of their online DPS transactions. They complied with the NVRA pre-litigation notice \nrequirements but Defendants failed to take the necessary steps to cure the statutory violation and \ncome into compliance. The threat of injury to Plaintiffs and others continues because Defendants \nhave refused to alter their practices. \nThe statutory violation and requisite injury occurred at the moment Dr. Woods was \ndenied a simultaneous voter registration application. This should be sufficient to confer standing. \nLater disenfranchisement (regardless of the nature of the election) furthered the injury, but the \nviolation and immediate injury had already occurred during the online transaction with DPS. \nNVRA expressly reminds us that \"it is the duty of the Federal, State, and local governments to \npromote the exercise of [the fundamental right to votej.\" 52 U.S.C.  2050 1(a)(2). And it is the \n§ \nduty of \"Federal, State, and local governments to implement this chapter.  .\". 52 U.S.C. \n.  § \n20501 (b)(2). The State of Texas has combined state and federal voter registration; thus, the \nability to vote in state and local elections will be affected by any federal violation in the \nregistration process. See ACORNv. Miller, 129 F.3d 833, 837 (6th Cir. 1997) (explaining that \nNVRA registration requirements will affect state and local elections). More importantly, there is \nnothing in the NVRA stating that a voter must be disenfranchised in a federal election before \nthey can bring an enforcement action. In fact, nothing in the NVRA states that a voter must be \ndisenfranchised at all.  See 52 U.S.C.  20510 (b)(1) (\"A person who is aggrieved by a violation \n§ \nof this chapter.  .\"). The courts have recognized organizational plaintiffs' standing under the \n. \n36 \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 105   Filed 05/10/18   Page 37 of 61\nNVRA to sue states with unlawful registration procedures and they do not require the \norganizational members to be disenfranchised. See, e.g., Scott, 771 F.3d at 837 (standing \nconferred because organization expended resources on voter register drives outside public \nassistance agencies); Fowler, 178 F.3d at 360-61 (same). To require more from an individual \nvoter like Dr. Woods who personally went through the process is inconsistent with the plain \nlanguage of the statute and basic principles of standing. \nD.  Waiver of immunity \nDefendants also assert that Plaintiffs have failed to validly invoke the NVRA's limited \nwaiver of immunity and are not entitled to bring an action under the Ex parte Young exception to \nimmunity. \nThe NVRA imposed voter registration requirements on the states to ensure that all \npractical barriers that make voter registration more restrictive or inconvenient are removed. \nMore than thirty years later, there are states that still refuse to comply with its mandates. \nCongress's abrogation of immunity under the NYRA is clear and unequivocal. When a state fails \nto comply with the Act, the Act authorizes judicial intervention. The Attorney General can seek \ndeclaratory or injunctive relief, and the Act establishes a private right of action for individuals \naggrieved by a violation who meet the Act's notice requirement. 52 U.S.C.  205 10(a),(b). \n§ \nDefendants admit that they \"each play a part in implementing the NVRA in Texas.\" Docket no. \n82, p. 4. sos is chief election officer, and DP5 is a voter registration agency. Id. As such, they \nmay be sued in any enforcement action arising from violations. The evidence in this record \nclearly shows that Plaintiffs met the Act's notice requirement and gave Defendants an \nopportunity to cure. This private enforcement action is now appropriately before the Court. \nMoreover, the Supreme Court has long recognized Equal Protection claims of this nature against \nstate officials tasked with carrying out laws that affect the rights of voters. Crawford v. Marion \n37 \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 105   Filed 05/10/18   Page 38 of 61\nCounty, 553 U.S. 181 (2008) (Equal Protection claim against the Indiana Secretary of State and \nothers challenging state voter ID law); Burdick v. Takishi, 504 U.S. 428 (1992) (voter's Equal \nProtection claim against Hawaii Director of Elections and others challenging state write-in voting \nprohibition). \nE.  Renewal v. change of address \nDefendants also allege that Plaintiffs' challenge should be restricted to online change of \naddress transactions, not online renewal transactions, because Plaintiffs' transactions were for a \nchange of address rather than renewal. However, this argument seems to go to the underlying \nreason for the transaction, rather than the lawfulness of the process being challenged. Regardless \nof whether a Texan seeks to change his address or renew his driver's license online, the process \nis the same and the outcome is the same. DPS uses the same website (Texas.gov) and the same \n\"Driver's License Renewal and Change of Address\" system, which authenticates users, detects \neligibility, and processes data in the same manner for both renewals and changes of address. \nDocket no. 94-9, deposition of E. Hutchins, at 30:4-31:16; 33:8-34:1; docket no. 94-12, \ndeposition of S. Gipson, at 37:10-16 (the process is combined online, \"it's one system \ninterface\"); docket no. 93, website links and exh. A-i, A-2, A- 10 (DPS/Driver' s License \nDivision online process for driver's license renewal and/or change of address). Neither type of \ntransaction, using the same online process, allows simultaneous applications for voter \nregistration as required by the NYRA. Docket no. 94-12, deposition of S. Gipson, at 37:10-40:5. \nGiven that Defendants have chosen to combine the online process and use the same system for \nboth change of address and renewal transactions, a change in programming to allow online \nsimultaneous voter registration would mean a change for both types of transactions. Likewise, an \nNVRA violation in online change of address transactions imputes a violation in online renewal \ntransactions because Defendants admit that the online process (which encompasses both) does \n38 \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 105   Filed 05/10/18   Page 39 of 61\nnot allow simultaneous voter registration. Having combined the online process for both types of \ntransactions, both types of transactions fall within the same mandates under 52 U.S.C. \n§ \n20503(a)(1) and 20504 and will be affected by any relief granted herein. Accord Miller, 129 F.3d \nat 837 (the State chose, as a matter of convenience, to implement one voter registration process \nfor federal, state, and local elections; thus, the registration obligations imposed by the Act affect \nregistration procedures associated with state and local elections). For these reasons, the issue to \nbe examined is whether DPS' s online process for driver's license renewal and change of address \nviolates the NVRA by failing to allow simultaneous applications for voter registration. \nIn sum, the jurisdictional challenges and defenses raised in Defendants' motion for \nsummary judgment are virtually identical to those raised in their motion to dismiss, which the \nCourt previously denied. Docket no. 52. Nothing in the law or the record compels a different \nconclusion at this stage of the proceedings. \nF.  Merits of the NVRA claims \nFirst, Plaintiffs contend Defendants have violated and continue to violate the NVRA by \nfailing to provide simultaneous applications for voter registration during online driver's license \ntransactions. Second, Plaintiffs contend Defendants have violated and continue to violate the \nNVRA by requiring motor voters who use the online process to take additional steps to update \ntheir voter registration and separately submit information through a different transaction with a \ndifferent agency that duplicates information required in the driver's license transaction. And \nthird, Plaintiffs allege that Defendants have violated the NVRA by failing to ensure eligible \napplicants are registered to vote and to transmit voter registration information submitted online to \nthe appropriate State election official within the statutorily required timeframe. Docket no. 1, pp. \n15-17. \n39 \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 105   Filed 05/10/18   Page 40 of 61\n1.  Statutory interpretation \nBecause the parties disagree on the meaning of some of the applicable provisions in the \nNVRA, the Court is guided by the governing principles of statutory construction. The first step is \nto determine whether the statutory text, when considered in context, is plain and unambiguous. If \nthe statutory language is plain, the Court must enforce it according to its terms. King v. Burwell, \n135 S.Ct. 2480, 2489 (2015) (citing Hardt v.  Reliance Standard Li:fe Ins. Co., 560 U.S. 242, 251 \n(2010)). \"[O]ftentimes the \"meaning  or ambiguity  of certain words may only become evident \nwhen placed in context.\" Id.  (citing FDA v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 529 U.S. 120, \n132 (2000)). \"So when deciding whether the language is plain, we must read the words 'in their \ncontext and with a view to their place in the overall statutory scheme.\" Id. (quoting, in part, \nBrown & Williamson, 529 U.S. at 133). \"Our duty, after all, is 'to construe statutes, not isolated \nprovisions.\" Id. (quoting, in part, Graham County Soil and Water Conservation Dist. v.  United \nStates ex rel.  Wilson, 559 U.S. 280, 290 (2010)). \"A provision that may seem ambiguous in \nisolation is often clarified by the remainder of the statutory scheme.  because only one of the \n.  . \npermissible meanings produces a substantive effect that is compatible with the rest of the law.\" \nKing v. Burwell, 135 S.Ct. at 2492 (quoting United Say. Assn. of Tex v.  Timbers of Inwood \nForest Associates, Ltd., 484 U.S. 365, 371 (1988)). The Court cannot interpret a federal statute in \na manner that negates its own stated purpose. See id. at 2495; see also New York State Dept. of \nSocial Servs. v. Dublino, 413 U.S. 405, 4 19-20 (1973). \n2.  The NVRA applies to motor voter transactions conducted online \nThe requirements in the NVRA clearly apply to online transactions (also known as \nelectronic, remote, or internet transactions). There is nothing in the statute that expressly or \nimpliedly excludes online transactions; instead, the plain language of the NVRA indicates that it \napplies to all transactions. See 52 U.S.C. §  20504 (a)(1) (\"Each State motor vehicle driver's \nD1 \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 105   Filed 05/10/18   Page 41 of 61\nlicense application. . .\") and (d) (\"any change of address form. .  .\") (emphasis added). \nNumerous courts have determined that the NVRA applies to online or remote transactions with \nthe same force as it applies to in person and mail transactions. See, e.g., Action NC v. Strach, 216 \nF.Supp. 3d 597, 622-23 (M.D.N.C. 2016) (\"[the] words 'each' and 'any' as used in NVRA \nprovision requiring that each state motor vehicle driver's license application serve as application \nfor voter registration and that any change of address form submitted shall serve as notification of \nchange of address for voter registration were unambiguous and reflected Congress' intent to \nmake the NVRA applicable to 'each' and 'every' covered transaction, irrespective of whether the \ntransaction occurred remotely or in person\"); Kemp, 841 F. Supp. 2d at 1331-32 (explaining that \nthe NVRA cannot be read to cover only in-person transactions and Georgia's limited \ninterpretation and implementation that excluded internet transactions conflicted with its \nacknowledgment that noncompliance likely led to decline in voter registration as more applicants \nprefer to apply remotely). \nDefendants have not argued that the NVRA does not apply to online or remote \ntransactions. In fact, they have admitted that compliance with the NVRA is required for online \ntransactions. See docket no. 77, appx. 65, deposition of S. Gipson (DPS), at 94:5-12 (Q: Why \ndoes DPS include a voter registration question during the online renewal and change of address \nportion? A: So it is part of the plan between the Secretary of State and Department of Public \nSafety in compliance with the voter registration question being combined as part of the \napplication process for a diver license or ID\"); 95:5-15 (Q: What requires you to do that? A: \nbasically the NVRA and Chapter 20 of the Election Code and Texas Statute.); docket no. 94-8, \ndeposition of S. Gipson at 136:20-23 (Q: Why does DPS require customers to answer that \nquestion if they don't even retain the answer? A: The  because we need to offer them the \navailability of the application); docket no. 94-11, deposition of K. Ingram (SOS), at 62:4-8 (Q: \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 105   Filed 05/10/18   Page 42 of 61\nWhy is there a voter registration question on the online DPS transaction  application?.  A: \n. . \nWell, I imagine it's because of Section 5 of the National Voter Registration Act of 1993. Q: \nCould you elaborate on that a little bit? A: Sure. The National Voter Registration Act of 1993 \nrequired that motor vehicle agencies, in our case the DPS, whenever a person has a driver's \nlicense transaction  driver's license transaction, that they should be simultaneously offered the \nright  the ability to update their voter registration or register to vote for the first time. That's \nwhy the NYRA is called the Motor Voter law.\"). Yet Defendants' compliance with the NVRA \nfalls short when it comes to online transactions. Texans have repeatedly complained about DPS's \nfailure to process voter registration information through its online system, but Defendants still \nrefuse to correct the deficiencies. Thus, rather than furthering the purpose of the NVRA by \n\"establish[ing] procedures that will increase the number of eligible citizens who register to \nvote,\"34 the State is thwarting the efforts of Texans who wish to register to vote. \n3.  The \"simultaneous application\" requirement \nCongress was not subtle about requiring DPS, a voter registration agency, to provide a \nsimultaneous application for voter registration. The terms are used more than once in the statute, \nand its plain meaning is clear and unambiguous. Section 20503, titled \"National procedures for \nvoter registration for elections for Federal office,\" directs that \"each State shall establish \nprocedures to register to vote. .  .  by application made simultaneously with an application for a \nmotor vehicle driver's license.\" 52 U.S.C.  20503(a)(1). Defendants do not dispute the meaning \n§ \n52 U.S.C.  2050 1(b)(1) \n§ \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 105   Filed 05/10/18   Page 43 of 61\nof \"simultaneous,\" which is defined as \"existing or occurring at the same time; exactly \ncoincident,\"35 or \"happening or existing at exactly the same time,\"36 or  \"occurring, operating, \nor done at the same time.\"37 \nSection 20504, titled \"Simultaneous application for voter registration and application for \nmotor vehicle driver's license\" explains this requirement as one simultaneous application form \nthat serves dual purposes  driver's license and voter registration. This section, when read in \ncontext, not only requires that the applications be simultaneous, but discusses them in terms of a \nsingle transaction. Under subsection (a), each State motor vehicle driver's license application \n\"(including any renewal application).  shall serve as an applicationf or voter registration\" \n.  . \nand \"[am  application for voter registration. .  . shall be considered as updating any previous \nvoter registration by the applicant.\" Under subsection (c), \"[ejach State shall include a voter \nregistration application form.  as part of an application for a State motor vehicle driver's \n.  . \nlicense,\" and the \"voter registration application portion of an application for a State motor \nvehicle driver's license.  may not require any information that duplicates information required \n.  . \nin the driver's license portion of the form.\" 52 U.S.C.  20504(a),(c). Under subsection (d), \n§ \n\"[amy change of address form\".  for purposes of a State motor vehicle driver's license shall \n.  . \nserve as notification of change of address for voter registration.  unless the registrant states on \n.  . \nthe form that the change of address is not for voter registration purposes.\" 52 U.S.C.  20504(d). \n§ \nDefendants seem to have a clear understanding of what the statute requires, yet they \ndistort the statutory language in the interpretations they propose. For example, Mr. Ingram with \nSOS testified that \"the NVRA requires a simultaneous opportunity to register to vote.\" See \n35https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/simultaneous \n36https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english!simultaneous \n37https://en.oxforddictionaries.comldefinitionlsimultaneous \n43 \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 105   Filed 05/10/18   Page 44 of 61\ndocket no. 77, appx. 40, deposition of K. Ingram, at 63:15-16; 64:24-25; see also appx. 113, \nRFA no. 4 (inserted the word \"opportunity\" when asked to admit their legal obligations under the \nNVRA). Defense counsel uses the same \"simultaneous opportunity\" argument in their briefs. But \nthe NVRA plainly and unequivocally requires DPS, a voter registration agency, to provide a \nsimultaneous application  not merely a \"simultaneous opportunity\" to go through a second \nduplicate application process with SOS. \"Opportunity\" could mean many things, but we do not \nneed to speculate about what it means because the NVRA does not use that term. Likewise, Ms. \nGipson testified that DPS \"need[s] to offer them the availability of the application.\" Docket no. \n94-8, deposition of S. Gipson, at 136:20-23. But the NVRA requires more than simply making \nvoter registration applications \"available.\" Again, making applications \"available\" could mean \nmany things but the NVRA does not use that term. The operative terms in the NYRA are much \nmore commanding and specific: it clearly and unequivocally requires a \"simultaneous \napplication\" with DPS (the voter registration agency), not a mere \"opportunity\" to go through a \nwholly separate, non-simultaneous application process with SOS. If the Court were to accept the \nargument that DPS can simply direct Texans to SOS to obtain, fill out, sign, and mail in or \ndeliver in person a wholly separate voter registration form, the language in the NVRA would be \nrendered meaningless. Plaintiffs are correct in their assertion that the central fact of this case has \nnever been disputed: when eligible Texans update their driver's licenses online with DPS, they \nare not provided a simultaneous application to register to vote or update their voter registration \ninformation. The NVRA's requirement that DPS, a voter registration agency, provide a \nsimultaneous application for both driver's license and voter registration purposes is plain and \nunambiguous and the facts in the record confirm that Texans are being deprived of this statutory \nright. Docket no. 77, appx. 118, admission no. 8 (Defendants admit that now when applicants \nreach Step 5 of the online process, they are asked \"Do you want to request a voter application?\"); \n44 \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 105   Filed 05/10/18   Page 45 of 61\nadmission no. 11 (Defendants admit that if an eligible voter checks \"yes\" under the question \"Do \nyou want to request a voter application?,\" they are not registered to vote.  unless they submit \n.  . \nan image of their signature, either by submitting a signed application by mail, or providing an \nelectronic image of their physical signature in person at a DPS location) (emphasis added); appx. \n121, admission no. 9 (Defendants admit that a \"Yes\" answer during an online transaction is never \nentered as a response in the Voter Field for purposes of forwarding the information to SOS); \nappx.  123, admission nos. 21, 23 (Defendants admit that when an eligible voter who updates his \nor her driver's license information on the current DPS website responds \"yes\" under the \nstatement \"Request a voter registration application,\" DPS does not transfer his or her data to \nSOS); appx. 96, admission no. 8 (Defendants admit that an eligible voter who changes the \naddress on her non-commercial Texas driver's license online must submit a signed voter \nregistration application in person or by mail in order for his voter registration information to be \nupdated. The DPS and Texas.gov online interface links such voters to an application they may \nprint out, sign, and mail, and also gives such voters the option to request that a voter registration \napplication be mailed to them, postage paid, and contains language indicating that the separate \nform must be filled out in order to complete the voter's registration) (emphasis added); appx. 98, \nadmission no. 12 (information voters submit to the DPS change of address online portal relating \nto voter registration is not transmitted to SOS); see also docket no. 77, appx. 33, DPS Voter \nInquiry Web Portal (informing the public that online registration is not possible, and persons \nseeking voter registration must print, sign, and deliver the application to the voter registrar in \ntheir county); appx. 133, driver's license renewal and change of address receipt (showing that a \nseparate voter registration application may be requested). Thus, it is clear that Defendants are \nviolating 52 U.S.C.  20503 and 20504 by failing to comply with the simultaneous application \n§ \nrequirement. \n45 \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 105   Filed 05/10/18   Page 46 of 61\n4.  The duplicate information prohibition \nTo further the simultaneous application requirement, Congress saw fit to prohibit the \nstates from requiring duplicate information. The prohibition against duplicate information is \nplain and unambiguous, leaving no room for argument as to its meaning. Section 20504(c)(2)(A) \nclearly states that \"[t]he voter registration application portion of an application for a State motor \nvehicle driver's license may not require any information that duplicates information required in \nthe driver's license portion of the form.\" This prohibition reinforces the simultaneous application \nrequirement because an application that is truly simultaneous does not require duplication. On \nthe other hand, any process that requires duplication of information is an indication that the voter \nregistration \"portion\" of an application for a State motor vehicle driver's license is not truly \nsimultaneous. The NVRA does permit states to seek a \"minimum amount\" of additional \ninformation that may be necessary for \"State election officials to assess the eligibility of the \napplicant\" for voter registration purposes. 52  20504 (c)(2)(B),(C). But the minimum \n§ \ninformation necessary to verify voter registration eligibility cannot duplicate the information \nalready provided for driver's license purposes. For example, some states do not require \ncitizenship to obtain a driver's license, so those states could include a citizenship question in the \nvoter registration portion of the application without violating the duplicate information \nprohibition. But Texas DPS requires an applicant to answer a citizenship question for driver's \nlicense purposes; thus, another duplicate question about citizenship for voter registration \npurposes would violate this prohibition. \nDefendants' violation of the duplicate information prohibition is indisputable, and has \ncontinued unabated. Defendants admit that none of the information in the online application for \ndriver's license renewal or change of address is used for voter registration purposes. At the end \nof the DPS transaction, a \"yes\" answer does not mean that the information already provided will \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 105   Filed 05/10/18   Page 47 of 61\nbe used for voter registration purposes pursuant to the NVRA. Instead, the DPS transaction ends, \nnone of the information already provided is forwarded to SOS, and the user is directed to SOS \nfor an entirely separate voter registration application that requires the same information already \nprovided to DPS in the driver's license transaction. It is a separate and distinct transaction with a \nseparate office (SOS) which requires a separate and distinct application with duplicate \ninformation. Docket no. 77, appx. 96, admission no. 8 (Defendants admit that upon completion \nof the DPS transaction, a voter must follow the link to SOS and then \"request that a voter \nregistration be mailed to them.  and [the portal] contains language indicating that the separate \n. . \nform must be filled out in order to complete the voter's registration\"); appx. 132 (change of \naddress transaction informs users that their DPS transaction does not register them to vote and \nthey must follow link to SOS website where a separate voter application form can be downloaded \nor requested); appx. 134 (separate voter registration application provided by SOS that must be \nprinted, signed, and mailed); docket no. 93, exh. A-3 (same); exh. A-4 (SOS information page \nexplaining: a) voter registration application forms can be accessed online through SOS (not DPS, \nthe voter registration agency); b) the application can be filled out on the computer, printed, and \nmailed to the voter registrar in the voter's county of residence; and c) informing voters that they \nwill not be registered until all steps are completed); docket no. 94-12, deposition of S. Gipson, at \n218:2-219:16 (explaining that at end of DPS transaction, the customer is directed to SOS if he \nwants to register to vote or update his voter registration information). \nIn Texas, DPS requires applicants seeking a renewal and/or change of address to provide \nseveral pieces of information, including their name, address, driver's license number, date of \nbirth, and the last four digits of their Social Security number. Docket no. 94-8, deposition of S. \nGipson, at 234:2-9; docket no. 94-9, deposition of E. Hutchins, at 25:11-22; docket no. 77, appx. \n130. When customers finish their transaction with DPS and then go to SOS to fill out a \n47 \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 105   Filed 05/10/18   Page 48 of 61\ncompletely separate application for voter registration purposes, they must provide the same \ninformation  name, address, driver's license number, date of birth, and the last four digits of \n: \ntheir Social Security number. Docket no. 77, appx. 134 (voter registration application); docket \nno. 94-7, deposition of B. Schonhoff, at 157:19-158:18 (both the DPS change of address form \nand SOS voter registration form ask the person's name, date of birth, and address; applicants \nwould have to fill this information out twice). Requiring motor voters to go to a different agency \n(SOS) to obtain and fill out a separate application that requires the same information violates the \nprohibition against duplicate information set forth in 52 U.S.C.  20504(c). \n§ \n5.  The timely submission requirement \nThe NVRA also requires that \"a completed voter registration portion of an application for \na State motor vehicle driver's license accepted at a State motor vehicle authority shall be \ntransmitted to the appropriate State elections official not later than 10 days after the date of \nacceptance.\" 52 U.S.C.  20504(e)(1). The deadline for transmittal is shorter (five days) if the \n§ \nvoter registration application is accepted within five days before the last day for registration to \nvote in an election. 52 U.S.C.  20504(e)(2). Because the evidence in the record shows that DPS \n§ \ndoes not provide simultaneous voter registration as part of the online driver's license renewal and \nchange of address process, DPS does not transmit to SOS any voter registration information in \nconnection with such transactions. In fact, it is undisputed that DPS does not even record, and \ntherefore cannot transmit, motor voters' responses to the voter registration question in the online \ndriver's license renewal and change of address application. Docket no. 94-8, deposition of S. \nGipson at 136:10-19; docket no. 77, appx. 67, deposition of S. Gipson at 102:10-19:103:16-25; \ndocket no. 94-7, deposition of B. Schonhoff at 159:23-160:3; 220:18-23. \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 105   Filed 05/10/18   Page 49 of 61\nAs a voter registration agency, DPS has a statutory duty to provide motor voters with \nsimultaneous voter registration applications and transmit the applications to SOS within 10 days \nafter acceptance. DPS admits it does not submit voter registration information to SOS for online \ntransactions conducted by motor voters \"[b]ecause [they] have not been advised by the Secretary \nof State that providing that through the online process is permissible at this point.\" Docket no. \n77, appx. 67, deposition of S. Gipson at 103:16-25. The NVRA's timely submission requirement \ncontinues to be violated in every online renewal and change of address transaction. \n6.  State law must yield to federal law \nThe facts in the record lead to only one conclusion: DPS, a voter registration agency, does \nnot provide a simultaneous voter registration application to motor voters who engage in online \ndriver's license transactions. Instead, motor voters are simply directed to SOS, which requires \nthem to fill out a completely separate voter registration application with duplicate information, \nand then print, mail, and/or hand deliver it to the voter registrar. But Defendants have refused to \nchange their practice, claiming that Texas election law does not allow the procedure dictated by \nthe NYRA. This argument is fatally flawed. \nDefendants claim that the NYRA incorporates Texas election law, making it subject to \nstate law, and rely on the following provisions: \n(a)  In general \n(1)  Each State motor vehicle driver 's license application (including any \nrenewal application) submitted to the appropriate State motor vehicle \nauthority under State law shall serve as an application for voter \nregistration. \n. \n*  *  * \n49 \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 105   Filed 05/10/18   Page 50 of 61\n(d)  Change of address \nAny change of address form submitted in accordance with State law for purposes \nof a State motor vehicle driver 's license shall serve as notification of change of \naddress for voter registration. \n52 U.S.C.  20504(a)(l), (d). \n§ \nThese provisions neither incorporate Texas election law nor make it subject thereto. \nInstead, the plain language of these provisions, when considered in context and with a view to \ntheir place in the overall statutory scheme, simply mean that driver's license applications \nsubmitted in accordance with state driver's license laws (i.e., the Texas Transportation Code), \nshall also serve as applications for voter registration purposes. The reference to state law in these \nprovisions cannot be interpreted to mean the NVRA is dictated by the election laws of 50 \ndifferent states, as it would be contrary to the plain language of the statute, require the Court to \ntake it out of context, and render the NVRA entirely meaningless. The NVRA was enacted under \nthe Elections clause, U.S. Const. Art. I § 4, ci. 1, which gives Congress the broad power to \npreempt, alter, and supplant state law when it comes to federal voter registration practices. \nArizona v. InterTribal County ofArizona, Inc., 570 U.S. 1, 133 S. Ct. 2247, 2253-57 (2013). \n(\"The Clause's substantive scope is broad\" and \"Elections Clause legislation, so far as it extends \nand conflicts with the regulations of the State, necessarily supersedes them\"). To the extent state \nvoter registration procedures are inconsistent with the NVRA, they are superseded. Id. at 2253-54 \n(\"the state law, so far as the conflict extends, ceases to be operative\"). On the other hand, the \nNVRA does not supplant state driver's license laws. Thus, interpreting the provisions in 52 \nU.S.C.  20504(a)(1) and (d) to mean that driver's license applications submitted in accordance \n§ \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 105   Filed 05/10/18   Page 51 of 61\nwith the Texas Transportation Code shall also serve as applications for voter registration \npurposes is consistent with the purpose of the Act and the entire statutory scheme. \nDefendants have consistently argued that DPS, the voter registration agency tasked with \ncarrying out the mandates of the NVRA, cannot provide motor voters with simultaneous driver's \nlicense - voter registration applications because Texas election law requires a physical signature. \nIn other words, Defendants claim that a physical signature written by hand is necessary to comply \nwith Texas election law; therefore, although online driver's license transactions are legally valid, \na simultaneous voter registration application would be legally invalid. Again, this argument is \nflawed for several reasons. \nFirst, Texas law cannot be used as an excuse for failing to comply with the NVRA. To the \nextent it is inconsistent with the NVRA, the Texas Election Code must yield to the NVRA. \nMoreover, Defendants have simply cheny-picked the provisions they believe justify their \ncontinued noncompliance. Defendants believe sections 13.002(b) and 15.02 1(a) of the Texas \nElection Code (requiring an application to be \"signed\") support their position,38 but they ignore \nsection 20.062 (requiring DPS to use a form and procedure that combines driver's license! \nrenewal/change of address with voter registration), which does not support their \nposition.39 \nDefendants' reliance on Texas election law as an excuse for federal noncompliance is misplaced \nbecause it is preempted, altered, and supplanted by the mandates in the NVRA. But even if Texas \n38Docket no. 94-11, deposition of K. Ingram, at 97:15-24; docket no. 77, appx. 42 (Q: \nWhat portion of the law doesn't allow it? A: 13.002(b)). \n39Section 20.062(a) states: The Department of Public Safety shall prescribe and use a \nform and procedure that combines the department's application form for a license or card with an \nofficially prescribed voter registration application form. Section 20.062(b) states: The department \nshall prescribe and use a change of address form and procedure that combines department and \nvoter registration functions. The form must allow a licensee or cardholder to indicate whether the \nchange of address is also to be used for voter registration purposes. \n51 \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 105   Filed 05/10/18   Page 52 of 61\nelection law was not preempted, there is nothing in the law that precludes the use of electronic \nsignatures. \nSecond, the NVRA does state that a simultaneous driver's license-voter registration \napplication and any renewal application \"requires the signature of the applicant.\" See 52 U.S.C. § \n20504(a)(1), (c)(2)(C)(iii). The NYRA's change of address provision is separate, and does not \nstate that a signature is necessary for a simultaneous driver's license-voter registration change of \naddress. 52 U.S.C.  20504(d). But even in renewal transactions that require a signature, neither \n§ \nthe NVRA nor Texas election law defines or limits the type of signature that is required for voter \nregistration renewal or change of address applications, and Defendants cite no authority for the \nproposition that it must be a physical ink signature written on paper by hand. With twenty-first \ncentury technology and legislation such as the Global and National Commerce Act (E-Sign Act) \nand Uniform Electronic Transactions Act (UETA), electronic signatures are legally recognized \nand widely used. 15 U.S.C.  7001 et. seq.; Unif. Electronic Transactions Act, U.L.A. (1999). \n§ \nUnder the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act, which has been adopted by Texas and 46 other \nstates, the medium in which a signature is created, presented or retained does not affect its legal \nsignificance. See UETA  7; Tex. Bus. & Com. Code Ann.  322.007(a),(c),(d) (Vernon 2015) \n§  § \n(TUETA). As these provisions explain: \n(a)  A record or signature may not be denied legal effect or enforceability solely \nbecause it is in electronic form. \n(c)  If a law requires a record to be in writing, an electronic record satisfies the law. \n(d)  If a law requires a signature, an electronic signature satisfies the law. \nInterpreting the signature requirement in the NVRA to include electronic signatures is consistent \nwith the purpose of the Act and the overall statutory scheme. Accord Kemp, 208 F. Supp. 3d at \n52 \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 105   Filed 05/10/18   Page 53 of 61\n133 5-36 (Georgia SOS argued that the \"records\" requirement in the NVRA was limited to \nphysical records; the court determined that the requirement includes electronic records). Mr. \nIngram, the 30(b)(6) representative for SOS, admits that an electronic signature complies with \nthe signatures requirements under the NVRA. Docket no. 77, appx. 40, deposition of K. Ingram \nat 62:18-63:1 (\"DPS' s compliance with [the NVRA] for in-person transactions is [satisfied by] \nthe question.  on the DPS forms, 'Do you want to register to vote? I've agreed to provide my \n.  . \nelectronic signature, and it can be sent to the Secretary of State's Office.\"). If an electronic \nsignature is legally sufficient under the NYRA for paper transactions, it is legally sufficient for \nonline transactions. The NVRA established procedures to remove barriers to voter registration, to \nmake the process easier and more convenient, and to increase voter participation. Interpreting the \n\"signature\" requirement to allow only physical, manual, or wet ink signatures written by hand on \npaper would be inconsistent with the plain language of the NVRA and the entire statutory \nscheme. And while Defendants continue to rely on Texas election law as a excuse for \nnoncompliance with the NVRA, there is nothing in Texas law that precludes the use of electronic \nrecords and electronic signatures. On the contrary, Texas law permits SOS and DPS to accept \nelectronic records and electronic signatures. See Tex. Bus. & Corn. Code  322.017 (each state \n§ \nagency has the option to accept electronic records and electronic signatures);4° Tex. Bus. & Corn. \nCode  322.007 (\"If a law requires a signature, an electronic signature satisfies the law.\").4' And \n§ \n40As Eiten Hersh noted, the refusal to accept electronic signatures appears to have been a \nstate policy decision. See docket no. 94-13, deposition of E. Hersh, at 121:23-122:25. But state \npolicy  like state law  must yield to the mandatory requirements under the NVRA. \n41See also Tex. Bus. & Corn. Code § 322.008(a) (\"If parties have agreed to conduct a \ntransaction by electronic means and a law requires a person to provide, send, or deliver \ninformation in writing to another person, the requirement is satisfied if the information is \nprovided, sent, or delivered, as the case may be, in an electronic record.  .\"); Tex. Bus. & Corn. \n. \nCode  322.012 (\"if a law requires that a record be retained, the requirement is satisfied by \n§ \nretaining an electronic record\"); Tex. Govt Code  2054.060 (\"digital signature may be used to \n§ \nauthenticate a written electronic communication sent to a state agency\");  Tex. Admin. Code \n1  § \n53 \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 105   Filed 05/10/18   Page 54 of 61\nit is undisputed that Texas is already using voter registration signatures in electronic form. See \nTex. Election Code  20.066 (for in person and mail transactions, the information provided is \n§ \ninput \"into the department's electronic data system\"; the applicant is informed \"that the \napplicant's electronic signature\" will be used; and the department \"electronically transfer[s] the \napplicant's voter registration data, including the applicant's [electronic] signature, to the \nsecretary of state\");  Tex. Admin. Code  81.58 (allowing a voter's signature to be captured by \n1  § \nan electronic device for the signature roster). Defendants provide no legal justification for failing \nto comply with the NVRA when it comes to online renewal and change of address transactions. \nFinally, Plaintiffs are not asserting that all signature requirements be tossed out or \nignored. Instead, they are asserting that Defendants already retain electronic signatures for every \nlicensed motor voter in Texas and currently use those electronic signatures for both driver's \nlicense and voter registration purposes; thus, there is no reason for refusing to use those same \nsignatures for online renewal and change of address transactions. See docket no. 77, appx. 39, 42, \ndeposition of K. Ingram at 50:1-11; 95:14-97:14; docket no. 77, appx. 69, 70, 79, deposition of \nS. Gipson at 203:19-204:7; 215:21-216:7; 234:21-235:1; 236:19-237:9. Even when a signature is \nrequired, that requirement may be satisfied with the electronic signature that is on file for every \nTexas motor voter.42 There is no legal impediment to using electronic signatures, and there is no \ntechnological barrier to online transactions that allow simultaneous renewal and change of \naddress for driver's license and voter registration. See docket no. 94-7, deposition of B. \nSchonhoff, at 222:9-22; docket no. 77, appx. 45, deposition of K. Ingram at 184:12-185:1; 186:5- \n203.24 (describing technology that may be acceptable for use by state agencies). \n42Because every Texan must provide an electronic signature when they obtain their \noriginal driver's license, and the online process only involves the renewal of an existing driver's \nlicense or a change of address on an existing driver's license, it is undisputed that the State of \nTexas already has preexisting electronic signatures for every motor voter that uses the online \nsystem. \n54 \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 105   Filed 05/10/18   Page 55 of 61\n16; docket no. 94-9, deposition of E. Hutchins at 99:22-100:2; docket no. 94-10, deposition of J. \nCrawford at 142:6-18; 143:12-144:2  (DLS could send all the information it currently obtains to \n1 \nthe Secretary of State's office, and \"it could also send the previously provided electronic \nsignature from that customer, just like it does with a mail-in change of address\"); docket no. 94- \n13, deposition of Eitan Hersh at 34:20-23 (\"my opinion is that there are no obvious substantial \ntechnical reasons why Texas does not do that or financial situations why Texas does not do \nthat\"); 110:6-111:13  \"it [could] transmit, just as it does now for mail and in-person \n(. .  . \ntransactions, the previously-recorded digital signature of the voter because everyone who is \nrenewing or changing their address online has a digital signature stored at the DPS\"); 115:15-25 \n(38 other states have an online process for voter registration). \nG.  Merits of the Fourteenth Amendment claim \nPlaintiffs also assert that Defendants' refusal to provide voter registration applications \nsimultaneously with online driver's license renewal and change of address transactions \nconstitutes a violation of their Equal Protection rights under the Fourteenth Amendment.43 The \nright to vote is a fundamental right protected under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth \nAmendment. Harper v.  Va. State Bd. of Elections, 383 U.S. 663, 670 (1966). \"The right to vote \nis protected in more than the initial allocation of the franchise. Equal protection applies as well to \nthe manner of its exercise.\" Bush  Gore, 531 U.S. 98, 104 (2000) (per curiam). The Equal \nv. \nProtection Clause applies when state procedures restrict voters' rights. Bush  Gore, 531 U.S. at \nv. \n103 (Supreme Court found that Florida's failure to institute reliable recount procedures violated \nthe Equal Protection Clause); Obama for Am. v. Husted, 697 F.3d 423, 436-3 7 (6th Cir. 2012) \n43\"The rights and remedies established by [the NYRA] are in addition to all other rights \nand remedies provided by law.\" 52 U.S.C.  205 10(d)(1). \n§ \n55 \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 105   Filed 05/10/18   Page 56 of 61\n(Circuit court found that Ohio law that prevented casting of early ballots by non-military voters \nviolated the Equal Protection Clause). \n1.  Applicable standard \nThe parties disagree on the applicable standard of review. Plaintiffs assert that the \nAnderson-Burdick44 standard applies (docket no. 77, pp. 19-23; docket no. 85, pp. 16-17), while \nDefendants assert that an Arlington Heights45 strict scrutiny analysis or City of Cleburne46 \nheightened scrutiny analysis applies (docket no. 82, p. 24; docket no. 88, pp. 19-20). Because this \ncase involves a challenge to a state voter registration procedure that is alleged to unfairly restrict \nthe right to vote and harm voter participation, the more flexible A nderson-Burdick standard \napplies. Burdick v.  Tukushi, 504 U.S. 428, 433 (1992) (\"to subject every voting regulation to \nstrict scrutiny and to require that the regulation be narrowly tailored to advance a compelling \nstate interest, as petitioner suggests, would tie the hands of States seeking to assure that elections \nare operated equitably and efficiently\").47 Under this standard, \"[a] court considering a challenge \nto a state election law must weigh the character and magnitude of the asserted injury to the rights \nprotected by the [Constitution] that the plaintiff seeks to vindicate against the precise interests \n44Anderson v. Celebrezze, 460 U.S. 780 (1983) and Burdickv. Takushi, 504 U.S. 428 \n(1992). \n45Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Dev.  Corp., 429 U.S. 252 (1977). \n46City of Cleburne, Texas v. Cleburne Living Center, 473 U.S. 432 (1985). \n47See also Votingfor Am., Inc. v. Steen, 732 F.3d 382 (5th Cir. 2013) (Fifth Circuit \napplied Anderson-Burdick analysis in challenge to state law regulating volunteer deputy \nregistrars); Tex. Democratic Party v.  Williams, 285 Fed. Appx. 194, 195 (5th Cir. 2008) (per \ncuriam) (noting that district court properly applied A nderson-Burdick balancing test to the \nconstitutional claims challenging use of eSlate voting machines), cert. denied, 555 U.S. 1100 \n(2009); Faas v. Cascos, 225 F. Supp. 3d 604, 610 (S.D. Tex. 2016) (State election laws \"could \nhardly serve their legitimate purposes if they were routinely subject to strict scrutiny... [thus], \n[t]he United States Supreme Court recognized the need for a more flexible analytical framework \nin two landmark cases: Anderson and Burdick\"). \n56 \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 105   Filed 05/10/18   Page 57 of 61\nput forward by the State as justification for the burden imposed by its rule, taking into \nconsideration the extent to which those interests make it necessary to burden the plaintiff's \nrights.\" Burdick, 504 U.S. at 434 (internal quotes omitted). \"However slight the burden [to the \nvoters] may appear, . .  . it must be justified by relevant and legitimate state interests sufficiently \nweighty to justify the limitation.\" Crawford v. Marion Cty. Elec. Bd., 553 U.S. 181, 191 (2008). \n2.  Analysis \n\"[V]oting is of the most fundamental significance under our constitutional structure,\" \nBurdick, 504 U.S. at 433, and unfair registration procedures can have a direct and damaging \neffect on voter participation. See 52 U.S.C.  2050 l(a)(3) (Congressional findings). While the \n§ \nState can impose reasonable restrictions, those restrictions must be justified by specific interests \nthat outweigh the burden on voters. The undisputed facts show that Defendants permit \nsimultaneous voter applications for motor voters that renew or change their driver's license in \nperson or by mail, but refuse simultaneous voter applications for motor voters that renew or \nchange their driver's license online. Motor voters that renew or change their driver's license in \nperson or by mail need only check a single box indicating that he would like to register or update \nhis voter information. After checking the box on the driver's license form, no further steps are \nnecessary. DPS sends the updated information to SOS in nightly batches, so the voter registration \nis updated timely and efficiently. However, motor voters that renew or change their driver's \nlicense online are denied the same process. Online motor voters must end their DPS driver's \nlicense transaction, and then go to SOS to obtain, print, and complete a separate voter registration \napplication which requires duplicate information.48 Once the additional application is complete, it \n48See generally pp.  17-19, supra. \n57 \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 105   Filed 05/10/18   Page 58 of 61\nmust be mailed or hand delivered.49 DPS, a voter registration agency, maintains a procedure that \naccepts simultaneous voter registration applications for some, while rejecting them for others. \nThis type of restriction on voter registration imposes a burden on the fundamental right to vote \nthat warrants the demonstration of a corresponding interest sufficiently weighty to justify the \nlimitation. \nDefendants' only justification for the voter registration burden imposed on motors voters \nis the \"signature\" requirement under Texas election law. However, neither federal nor state law \nlimits the signature requirement to physical hand written signatures on paper.5° Electronic \nsignatures and electronic records are legally recognized and widely used, and Defendants offer no \nreason for refusing to accept them for online motor voter transactions.51 DPS already uses \nelectronic records and previously imaged electronic signatures for every Texan that uses the \nonline system for driver's license renewal or change of address.52 SOS admits that electronic \nsignatures comply with signature requirements under the NVRA and Texas Election Code.53 SOS \nadmits it never uses physical, manual, or wet ink handwritten signatures on paper for voter \n49See id. \n50See pp. 52-55, supra. \n51See id. \n52Docket no. 77, appx. 70, deposition of S. Gipson at 215:21-216:7 (for online \ntransactions, Texas has decided that a previously captured electronic signature is sufficient for \ndriver's license purposes, but they refuse to accept the same signature for voter registration \npurposes); Stipulation no. 11, p. 5, supra (\"The signature that appears on the license generated as \na result of a customer's online driver's license renewal or change of address transaction is an \nimage of the applicant's physical signature, electronically captured during the applicant's most \nrecent in-person transaction\"). \n53Docket no. 77, appx. 39-40, 42, K. Ingram deposition at 50:1-6; 62:4-63:1; 97:4-14. \n58 \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 105   Filed 05/10/18   Page 59 of 61\nregistration purposes.54 DPS already has, in its possession and control, an electronic signature of \nevery motor voter that has been issued a license. With motor voters' electronic signatures already \nin the voter registration agency's possession, there is no reason why Defendants could not \nregister them to vote in a simultaneous online transaction. \nNeither the law nor the facts support Defendants' alleged justification for limiting \nsimultaneous voter applications to in-person and mail motor voter transactions and refusing \nsimultaneous voter applications for motor voters that renew or change their driver's license \nonline. Because the alleged justification is not legitimate, there is no state interest that outweighs \nthe burden imposed on voters. Defendants fail to demonstrate a corresponding interest \nsufficiently weighty to justify the limitation on voters' rights. \nNot only have Defendants failed to justify their actions, but they also acknowledge that \npermitting simultaneous voter applications for motor voters that renew or change their driver's \nlicense online would be technologically very feasible and the cost would be minimal.55 In fact, \nthe undisputed testimony reflects that changing the online process to include simultaneous voter \n54Docket no. 77, appx. 39, K.

Ingram at 184:19-185:2 (it's \n\"technically possible\" and \"I don't think it would cost a lot of money\"), 186:15-16 (\"I'm not \ncontesting the logistics of it\"); docket no. 77, appx. 90, deposition of J. Crawford (from an IT \nperspective, DLS is currently capable of sending the voter data and electronic signature to SOS); \nsee also docket no. 94-13, deposition of E. Hersh at 110:6-10 (it would be a \"massive cost \nsavings\"); 111:10-13 (the savings would be statewide); report of E. Hersh at pp. 6, 12-15 (the \ntechnology clearly exists for state motor vehicle authorities that allow online transactions). \n59 \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 105   Filed 05/10/18   Page 60 of 61\nregistration applications would very likely lead to greater efficiency for the State and increased \nvoter registration for Texans.56 See Anderson, 460 U.S. at 806 (even if the State has legitimate \ninterests, if the State also has open to it a less drastic way of satisfying those interests it may not \nchoose a scheme that restricts the right to vote). \nVI. \nConclusion \nDPS encourages Texans to use its online services to renew their driver's license and \nchange their address because it is easier and more convenient.57 It cannot, at the same time, deny \nsimultaneous voter registration applications when those online services are used. DPS is legally \nobligated, as a designated voter registration agency under the NVRA, to permit a simultaneous \nvoter registration application with every transaction. Asking motor voters whether they are \ninterested in voter registration and sending them to SOS for an entirely separate application \nprocess is not enough. The NVRA demands much more from voter registration agencies. \nDefendants are violating §  20503(a)(l); 20504(a),(c),(d), and (e); 20506(4)(A)(iii), and (d); and \n20507(a)(1)(A) of the NVRA and their excuse for noncompliance is not supported by the facts or \nthe law. Plaintiffs are also being denied equal protection under the law. Plaintiffs are entitled to \nthe relief they are seeking herein. \nIt is therefore ORDERED Plaintiffs' Motion for Summary Judgment (docket no. 77) is \nGRANTED and Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment (docket no. 82) is DENIED.

INTRODUCTION \nTEXAS DEMOCRATIC PARTY (“TDP”), DSCC, and DCCC (“Intervenors”) seek to \nenter this case pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(a)(2) and 24(b)(1)(B) to ensure that Defendants may \nnot avoid their obligation to follow constitutional law to the detriment of eligible voters throughout \nTexas, simply because the original Plaintiffs to this action were deemed to not have standing. \nDefendants encourage Texas driver’s license holders to renew and/or update their addresses online \nat the website of the Department of Public Safety (“DPS”) while disenfranchising these same \nTexans through an unlawful online process which does not permit users to simultaneously register \nto vote while deceiving them into believing they are doing so. This is in stark contrast to the process \nfor mail or in-person transactions, where Defendants permit simultaneous voter registration. \nThis Court previously determined that these practices violate both the National Voter \nRegistration Act and equal protection. Defendants appealed and the Fifth Circuit reversed, holding \nthat the original Plaintiffs to this action lacked standing. However, as Judge Ho noted in his \nconcurrence, it did not pass on the merits of this Court’s previous determination, saying nothing \nabout the legitimacy of Plaintiffs’ claims, or the legality of Texas’s current procedure. \nIntervenors, a state-wide organization and national committees invested in the success of \nDemocratic candidates, share Plaintiffs’ equal protection claims but not their standing infirmities, \nand seek intervention to permit the merits of this claim to be fully adjudicated. If granted, \nintervention would not be ancillary to the action of the original Plaintiffs. Rather, Intervenors have \nindependent grounds to prosecute this matter and to invoke the Court’s jurisdiction over the merits. \nIntervenors thus have a right to intervene under Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(a)(2). But they also fulfill the \nrequirements of permissive intervention under Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(b)(1)(B), and principles of \njudicial  economy  should  compel  the  court to  exercise  its  considerable  discretion  to  permit \n1 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 124   Filed 12/20/19   Page 6 of 16\nintervention on that basis as well. If the motion to intervene is denied, Intervenors would have \nevery right to bring this action instead as a new, independent complaint and pursue relief on the \nmerits against Defendants on the same equal protection grounds here. Denying intervention would \ncause unnecessary delay and waste the resources of the Court and the parties.  \nThe Fifth Circuit has previously held that intervenors with independent grounds to maintain \nan action may cure jurisdictional defects even after the action is dismissed. See Hunt Tool Co. v. \nMoore, Inc., 212 F.2d 685, 688-89 (5th Cir. 1954). This is because when there is an independent \nbasis for jurisdiction with regard to the intervenor’s claim, the court has discretion to treat its \npleadings as a separate action to adjudicate the claims efficiently and to avoid unnecessary delay. \nSee 7C Charles Alan Wright & Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure § 1917 (3d ed.).  \nHere, Intervenors possess an independent basis to invoke the Court’s jurisdiction and seek \nto bring a claim the Court already decided on the merits. Granting intervention would streamline \nthe procedure through which this case ultimately gets resolved. Denying intervention would slow \nresolution, but not alter the result. The equities also strongly favor permitting Intervenors to pursue \nthis action by intervention, because of the important fundamental rights at stake, and every day \nthat Defendants are permitted to continue with their unconstitutional action is a day in which \neligible Texans have their right to access the franchise unconstitutionally burdened. \nII.  FACTUAL BACKGROUND \n  On May 10, 2018, this Court issued an opinion granting summary judgment for \nPlaintiffs on their claims that Defendants’ administration of voter registration through Texas’s \nDPS online system violated the NVRA and the equal protection clause. Stringer v. Pablos, 320 F. \nSupp. 3d 862, 900-901 (W.D. Tex. 2018). Plaintiffs alleged that Defendants “deprive[] Texans of \ntheir federal right to register to vote or update their voter registration simultaneously with their \n2 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 124   Filed 12/20/19   Page 7 of 16\nonline driver’s license renewal and change of address transactions,” and Defendants “admit that \nthe key facts of this case are undisputed.” Id. at 868. Defendants did not allow for simultaneous \nvoter registration or registration updates online despite permitting simultaneous voter registration \nfor mail and in-person transactions. Id. at 872-73. Defendants continue to engage in these practices \ntoday. See Ex. A, Paxton Press Release (Nov. 14, 2019), at 1-2 (“Currently, Texans who use the \nDPS  driver  license  renewal  and  change-of-address  website  are  sent  to  a  separate  page  – \nadministered by the Texas Secretary of State – where they can complete an online application, \nprint it out, sign it, and mail it to their county voter registrar to ensure their ability to vote in \nupcoming elections.”). \n  The Fifth Circuit reversed this Court’s ruling on November 13, 2019, finding Plaintiffs did \nnot have standing because they became registered prior to filing and because they failed to \ndemonstrate a substantial likelihood of future injury from Defendants’ conduct. Stringer, 942 F.3d \nat 721-22, 724-25. The Fifth Circuit’s mandate, returning the case to this Court, issued on \nDecember 5. ECF No. 122-1. The Fifth Circuit did not reach the merits of Plaintiffs’ claims or \npass on the Court’s judgment.  \nIII.  ARGUMENT \nA.  Intervenors  have  independent  grounds  of  jurisdiction  to  support  this \n  lawsuit \n  The Court may properly grant the motion for intervention because Intervenors have \nindependent grounds of jurisdiction to support an equal protection claim. Intervenors are a state-\nwide  organization  and  national  committees  that  are  invested  in  the  success  of  Democratic \ncandidates, including in Texas. Intervenors’ Compl. at ¶¶ 11-13. Defendants’ continuing equal \nprotection violations frustrate these efforts, forcing Intervenors to devote additional resources to \ncombat Defendants’ ongoing violations that could otherwise be allocated to different portions of \n3 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 124   Filed 12/20/19   Page 8 of 16\nIntervenors’ mission. Id. The Supreme Court and the Fifth Circuit have held similar injuries \nsufficient to grant organizational standing, including in a case brought by TDP itself. See, e.g., \nCrawford v. Marion Cty. Election Bd., 553 U.S. 181, 189 n.7 (2008) (agreeing with Seventh Circuit \nthat state Democratic party had standing to challenge law requiring government-issued photo \nidentification to vote); Tex. Democratic Party v. Benkiser, 459 F.3d 582, 585-86 (5th Cir. 2006) \n(holding TDP had standing to challenge unconstitutional state action based on diversion of \nresources and harmed electoral prospects). \nIntervenors, as political organizations, also have standing to assert the rights of their \nmembers, some number of whom will inevitably be injured by Defendants’ continuing arbitrary \npolicies. This provides these organizations with representational standing to bring their members’ \nclaims. Alabama Legislative Black Caucus v. Alabama, 575 U.S. 254, 268-271 (2015) (reversing \nholding that Alabama Democratic Conference lacked standing to bring the claims of its members \nin racial gerrymandering case); Sandusky Cty. Democratic Party v. Blackwell, 387 F.3d 565, 574 \n(6th Cir. 2004) (holding political party had associational standing to assert the rights of its \nsupporters even though plaintiffs did not identify a specific voter that would be prospectively \nharmed; that some voters would be harmed was “inevitable”); Fla. Democratic Party v. Scott, 215 \nF. Supp. 3d 1250, 1254 (N.D. Fla. 2016) (“[P]olitical parties have standing to assert, at least, the \nrights of its members who will vote in an upcoming election. That [i]s so even [when] the political \nparty c[an] not identify specific voters that would be affected; it is sufficient that some inevitably \nwould.”); Bay Cty. Democratic Party v. Land, 347 F. Supp. 2d 404, 422 (E.D. Mich. 2004) \n(“[P]olitical parties and candidates have standing to represent the rights of voters.”). \nIntervenors’ independent bases for standing to assert the equal protection claims brought \nby Plaintiffs provide the Court jurisdiction to continue this action. Hunt, 212 F.2d at 688 (reversing \n4 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 124   Filed 12/20/19   Page 9 of 16\ndistrict court’s judgment dismissing intervention because intervenors had independent grounds of \njurisdiction to support the action); cf. Summit Office Park, Inc. v. U.S. Steel Corp., 639 F.2d 1278, \n1282 (5th Cir. 1981) (holding that “where a plaintiff never had standing to assert a claim against \nthe defendants, [that plaintiff] does not have standing to amend the complaint and control the \nlitigation by substituting new plaintiffs” (emphasis added)); Simmons v. I.C.C., 716 F.2d 40, 46 \n(D.C. Cir. 1983) (“An intervener lacking an independent jurisdictional basis cannot maintain suit \nwhere the court lacked original subject matter jurisdiction.”) (emphasis added); Wright, supra \n(“[I]f there is an independent basis for jurisdiction with regard to the intervenor’s claim, the court \nhas discretion to treat those pleadings as a separate action [] to adjudicate the claims raised by the \nintervenor.”).  \nBy allowing the lawsuit to continue with Intervenors, “the [C]ourt can avoid the senseless \ndelay and expense of a new suit, which at long last will merely bring the parties to the point where \nthey now are.” Fuller v. Volk, 351 F.2d 323, 329 (3d Cir. 1965) (quotations and citations omitted). \nB.  Intervenors are entitled to intervene as of right \nIntervenors meet the Fifth Circuit’s liberal test for intervention as of right. In re Lease Oil \nAntitrust Litig., 570 F.3d 244, 248 (5th Cir. 2009) (holding that intervention is liberally construed, \nand any doubts are resolved in favor of intervenors). Intervenors’ application is timely, they have \na direct interest in the subject matter of this lawsuit, disposing of this action will practically impair \ntheir ability to protect their interests, and Plaintiffs can no longer adequately represent Intervenors’ \ninterests. Haspel & Davis Milling & Planting Co. v. Bd. Of Levee Comm’rs. of The Orleans Levee \nDist. & State Of Louisiana, 493 F.3d 570, 578 (5th Cir. 2007); see also Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(a)(2). \n1.  Intervenors’ motion to intervene is timely \nIntervenors’ motion is timely under the Fifth Circuit’s four-part test. The Court has broad \n5 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 124   Filed 12/20/19   Page 10 of 16\ndiscretion in considering: “(1) the length of time between the would-be intervenor’s learning of \nhis interest and his petition to intervene, (2) the extent of prejudice to existing parties from allowing \nlate intervention, (3) the extent of prejudice to the would-be intervenor if the petition is denied, \nand (4) any unusual circumstances.” In re Lease Oil Antitrust Litig., 570 F.3d at 247–48. These \nfactors are not dispositive but merely provide a framework for the analysis. Edwards v. City of \nHouston, 78 F.3d 983, 1000 (5th Cir. 1996).  \nIntervenors’ motion is timely because they filed slightly more than two weeks after this \ncase returned to the district court following the Fifth Circuit’s ruling, which rendered Plaintiffs \nunable to continue protecting Intervenors’ interest. Edwards, 78 F.3d at 1000 (“The timeliness \nclock runs . . . from the time he became aware that his interest would no longer be protected by \nthe existing parties to the lawsuit.”); see also ECF 122. Until the Fifth Circuit’s ruling, Plaintiffs \nhad been adequately representing and protecting Intervenors’ interests, so Intervenors had neither \nthe necessity nor the right to intervene. See Fed. R. Civ. P. R. 24 (a)(2). Indeed, this Court’s \nfavorable  decision  is  particularly  salient  evidence  that  Plaintiffs  adequately  represented \nIntervenors’  interests.  When  the  Fifth  Circuit  dismissed  Plaintiffs’  suit  based  on  standing, \nIntervenors were suddenly faced with inadequate representation, and quickly pursued this motion. \nSee Stallworth, 558 F.2d at 267 (“By filing their petition less than one month after learning of their \ninterest in this case, the appellants discharged their duty to act quickly.”). \nThe existing parties will not be prejudiced if Intervenors’ motion is granted. The Court \nonly considers the potential prejudice to the parties caused by the delay in intervening, not the \nprejudice that may result from the intervention itself. Edwards, 78 F.3d at 1002; see also Stallworth \nv. Monsanto Co., 558 F.2d 257, 265 (5th Cir. 1977). The delay between the matter returning to \nthis Court and the intervention sought here—a day over two weeks—has not harmed the parties; \n6 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 124   Filed 12/20/19   Page 11 of 16\nthe docket shows that the parties have not pursued any action in this case since the Fifth Circuit’s \nmandate issued on December 5, 2019. This factor, too, weighs in favor of intervention.   \nBy contrast, Intervenors will be significantly prejudiced if the Court denies this motion. \nThe Court addressed the very same equal protection claim Intervenors seek to raise in its order on \nthe parties’ motions for summary judgment, finding that Defendants’ conduct violated equal \nprotection. See Stringer, 320 F. Supp. 3d at 901. Although it did not reach the merits of those \nclaims on appeal, the Fifth Circuit’s conclusion that Plaintiffs lacked standing resulted in reversal \nof that judgment. To protect their equal protection interests here, Intervenors are left with only two \noptions: they can intervene in this lawsuit and pursue the merits of the Court’s judgment, or they \ncan bring a new action raising the same claim against the same Defendants. If Intervenors are \nforced to bring a new suit, they will necessarily duplicate the efforts of the existing parties, and \nwill be significantly prejudiced as any potential remedy will encounter further, unnecessary delays. \nSee Stallworth, 558 F.2d at 267 (finding intervention appropriate when it “concern(ed) the same \nevidence, memories, and witnesses as the subject matter of the original class suit.” (citation and \nquotation marks omitted)). This factor, too, weighs in favor of intervention.  \nIntervenors’  motion  is  further  supported  by  the  unusual  circumstances  in  this  case. \nIntervenors seek to raise the exact same equal protection argument Plaintiffs successfully raised. \nThe Court is familiar with the facts and record and would not expend many judicial resources if it \ngranted this motion. Similarly, Defendants have already defended their position and would not \nneed to expend many resources if the Court permitted Intervenors to enter the lawsuit as plaintiffs. \nIntervenors are not seeking to reopen discovery but instead merely wish to file a dispositive \nmotion. Should this case proceed again on appeal, the Fifth Circuit will have the opportunity to \ndecide it on its merits, addressing questions Defendants have already briefed and argued.  \n7 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 124   Filed 12/20/19   Page 12 of 16\n2.  Intervenors have a strong interest in this action \n  Intervenors meet the second requirement for intervention as of right because they have both \norganizational and associational standing to bring the equal protection claims at issue here. To \nmeet this prong, Intervenors need only demonstrate an interest that substantive law recognizes as \nbelonging  to  them,  Edwards,  78  F.3d  at  1004,  which  is  “direct,  substantial,  [and]  legally \nprotectable.” Piambino v. Bailey, 610 F.2d 1306, 1321 (5th Cir.) (citations omitted), cert. denied, \n449 U.S. 1011 (1980). “[T]he ‘interest’ test is primarily a practical guide to disposing of lawsuits \nby involving as many apparently concerned persons as is compatible with efficiency and due \nprocess.” Ceres Gulf v. Cooper, 957 F.2d 1199, 1203 n.10 (5th Cir. 1992). As noted above, supra \nat 3-5, Intervenors have separate Article III standing to proceed with this matter, clearing this low \nbar. See Diamond v. Charles, 476 U.S. 54, 68-69 (1986) (noting that interest required for \nintervention under Rule 24(a)(2) is less burdensome than the requirements of Article III standing). \n3.  Disposition of this matter would impair Intervenors’ ability to protect \ntheir interest as a practical matter \n  Intervenors’ equal protection interest would practically be impaired by disposition of this \nmatter because Intervenors would have to pursue additional litigation to protect their interests. The \n“practical impairment” standard does not require that an intervenor demonstrate that they will be \nbound by disposition of the action, but rather permits intervention more liberally, Edwards, 78 \nF.3d at 1005, and the decision on whether an interest might be practically impaired “can only be \nmade with reference to the facts and procedural posture of the case.” United States v. City of \nJackson, Miss., 519 F.2d 1147, 1151 (5th Cir. 1975). The Fifth Circuit has, for example, permitted \nintervention when the practical impairment raised by the intervenor was the burden of pursuing \nadditional litigation. Gaines v. Dixie Carriers, Inc., 434 F.2d 52, 54 (5th Cir. 1970). \n  Intervenors face a practical impairment similar to that of the intervenors in Gaines, where \n8 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 124   Filed 12/20/19   Page 13 of 16\nintervention as of right was permitted because of the practical impairment of pursuing additional \nlitigation. There, a firm which had previously been part of a lawsuit filed a motion to intervene to \nprotect a claimed interest in the attorney’s fees at issue in the lawsuit, which it could have pursued \nin  a  separate  litigation.  Id.  at  54.  The  Fifth  Circuit  reversed  the  district  court’s  denial  of \nintervention, holding that despite the ability to bring a separate lawsuit disposition of the current \naction would practically impair or impede the ability to protect that interest. Id. \n  The procedural posture of this case and the facts unique to political parties and the harm \nhere enhance this practical impairment. Each day that passes without a resolution results in more \nof Intervenors’ members being unknowingly disenfranchised and causes Intervenors to have to \ndevote greater resources to combat that harm. Requiring Intervenors to pursue needless additional \nlitigation over many months merely to arrive at the same merits determination this Court already \nmade would be a significant practical impairment to Intervenors’ interest in this litigation. \n4.  Intervenors’ interests are inadequately represented by the existing \nparties \n \n  Intervenors also meet the last requirement because the Fifth Circuit’s decision renders \nexisting Plaintiffs unable to adequately represent Intervenors’ interests. Establishing inadequate \nrepresentation is a “minimal” burden which can be surmounted by “show[ing] that representation \nof [a putative intervenor’s] interest ‘may be’ inadequate.” Haspel, 493 F.3d at 578. If intervention \nis prohibited here, representation of Intervenors’ interests in this matter will be nonexistent. \nC.  Intervenors are also entitled to permissive intervention \nIn addition to intervention as of right, Intervenors are entitled to permissive intervention \nbecause their equal protection claim shares the exact same questions of law and fact as current \nplaintiffs’ equal protection claim, and the only undue delay and prejudice here will occur if \nIntervenors are forced to file a new lawsuit to advance this claim. To permissively intervene, \n9 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 124   Filed 12/20/19   Page 14 of 16\nIntervenors’ claims and defenses must have questions of law and fact in common and intervention \ncannot unduly delay or prejudice the original parties. Stallworth, 558 F.2d at 269; Fed. R. Civ. P. \n24(b)(1)(B), (3). Intervenors’ equal protection claim, like Plaintiffs’, turns on Texas’ disparate \ntreatment of eligible voters who utilize DPS’s online portal for driver’s license transactions. \nIntervenors meet the requirements of Rule 24(b), and the Court should exercise its broad \ndiscretion in allowing intervention. Kneeland v. Nat’l Collegiate Athletic Ass’n, 806 F.2d 1285, \n1289 (5th Cir. 1987) (“Permissive intervention ‘is wholly discretionary with the [district] court[.]’” \n(citation omitted)). In exercising that discretion, courts may consider if “the intervenors’ interests \nare adequately represented by other parties and whether intervention will unduly delay the \nproceedings  or  prejudice  existing  parties.”  Id.  (citation  omitted).  Plaintiffs  can  no  longer \nadequately represent Intervenors’ interests. And, undue delay and prejudice will only arise if this \nmotion is denied because Intervenors will file a separate lawsuit advancing the same equal \nprotection claim already decided here. See, e.g., Martinez v. United States, No. DR-05-CA-055, \n2005 WL 8155760, at *6 (W.D. Tex. Dec. 12, 2005) (“[I]f Plaintiffs’ and Applicants’ claims are \nall litigated in one action, the [Defendant] will not be subject to offensive use of non-mutual \ncollateral estoppel with respect to issues determined in this action.”). \nIV.  CONCLUSION \nThe Court already found that Texas’ online registration system violates equal protection. \nStringer, 320 F. Supp. 3d at 901. Judge Ho signaled that the Fifth Circuit may be inclined to agree. \nSee Stringer v. Whitley, 942 F.3d 715,726 (5th Cir. 2019) (“If it’s good enough for motorist \nlicensing, then it ought to be good enough for voter registration.”) (J. Ho, concurring). It defies \ncommon sense to force the parties and the Court to restart this lawsuit when the issues are primed \nfor decision. Intervenors respectfully request that the Court grant their motion to intervene.  \n10 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 124   Filed 12/20/19   Page 15 of 16\nDated: Dec. 20, 2019.

DSCC, AND \nDCCC'S COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \nNATURE OF THE CASE \n1.  This  action  seeks  declaratory  and  injunctive  relief  to  redress  Defendants' \nsystematic and continuing violation of the U.S.  Constitution's  guarantee of equal protection. \nIntervenor-Plaintiffs, whO have invested á'nd plan to invest substantially in voter registration efforts \nthroughout the state and  among whose membership are eligible Texas voters  who utilize the \nDepartment  of Public  Safety's  (\"DPS\")  online  portal  for  renewal  and  change  of address \ntransactions, have been  injured by Defendants'  continuing unconstitutional treatment of these \nindividuals, who are arbitrarily subject to differential treatment regarding their efforts to register \n1 Intervenor-Plaintiffs have substituted the name of the current Texas Secretary of State in this case \npursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 25(d). \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 137   Filed 01/21/20   Page 2 of 12\nto vote solely because they choose to utilize DPS's online portal for renewal and change of address \ntransactions rather than accomplishing these tasks in person or by mail. Texas voters will continue \nto be  shut out of the democratic process unless  and until Defendants reform their registration \npractices. \n2.  Defendants permit certain Texas driver's license holders to renew their license \nand/or update the address on their license online on DPS' website at www.txdps.state.tx.us. While \nthere have been many different iterations of this online process over the years, see Stringer v. \nFablos, 320 F. Supp. 3d 862, 869, 871, 876,  (W.D. Tex. 2018), none have offered any means for \nsimultaneous voter registration. Today, despite years of litigation over this issue before this Court, \nDefendants still fail to allow for simultaneous registration with online renewals and changes of \naddress. See Press Release, Ken Paxton, Attorney General of Texas, Fifth Circuit Rules in Favor \nof  Texas  Voter  Registration  System  in  \"Motor  Voter\"  Lawsuit  (Nov.  14,  2019), \nhttps://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/news/releases/fifth-circuit-rules-favor-texas-voter- \nregistration-system-motor-voter-lawsuit (\"Currently,  Texans  who  use  the  DPS  driver  license \nrenewal and change-of-address website are sent to a separate page  administered by the Texas \nSecretary of State  where they can complete an online application, print it out, sign it, and mail it \nto their county voter registrar to ensure their ability to vote in upcoming elections.\"). \n3.  In  contrast to the  multi-step process required for  a driver using DPS's online \nsystems to update their voter registration, DPS's in-person driver's license applications, ECF No. \n93, exh. A-7, in-person renewal/replacement/change of address forms, ECF No. 93, exh. A-8, and \nmail in change of address forms, ECF No. 93, ex. A-9, serve as simultaneous voter registration \napplications. \n2 \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 137   Filed 01/21/20   Page 3 of 12\n4.  Defendants' current practices treat similarly situated voters differently based solely \non how those voters choose to transact with DPS without any adequate justification, in violation \nof the U.S. Constitution's requirement of equal protection. \n5.  Defendants  must  not  be  permitted  to  continue  to  ignore  constitutional  Jaw. \nIntervenor-Plaintiffs respectfully request that this Court enjoin Defendants from further violations \nof the law and grant the relief set forth below. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n6.  Intervenor-Plaintiffs  sue  under  42  U.S.C.  §  1983  and  1988  to  redress  the \ndeprivation under color of state law of rights secured by the United States  Constitution. \n7.  This Court has original jurisdiction over the subject of this action under 28 U.S.C. \n1331 and 1343 because the matters in controversy arise under the Constitution and laws of the \n§ \nUnited States. \n8.  This Court has personal jurisdiction over Defendants, who are citizens of the State \nof Texas and sued in their official capacity  only. \n9.  Venue is proper in this Court under 28 U.S.C. §  139 1(b) because a substantial part \nof the events that caused Intervenor-Plaintiffs' claims occurred in this judicial  district, and each \nDefendant conducts business in this district. \n10.  This  Court  has  the authority to  enter a  declaratory judgment  and to  provide \ninjunctive relief under Rules 57 and 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and 28 U.S.C. \n2201 and 2202. \n§ \nPARTIES \n11.  Plaintiff the  Texas  Democratic Party  (\"TDP\")  is  the  statewide  organization \nrepresenting Democratic candidates and voters throughout the State of Texas within the meaning \n3 \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 137   Filed 01/21/20   Page 4 of 12\nof Section 117 of Texas's Election Code and all other applicable provisions of the election laws. \nTDP's purpose is to elect Democratic Party candidates to public office throughout Texas. To \naccomplish  its  purpose,  TDP  engages  in  vitally  important  activities,  including  supporting \nDemocratic  Party  candidates  in  national,  state,  and  local  elections  through  ftindraising  and \norganizing; protecting the legal rights of voters; and ensuring that all voters have a meaningful \nability to cast ballots in Texas. TDP has millions of members and constituents from across Texas, \nincluding millions of Texans who are registered with the Texas Department of State's Division of \nElections as Democrats, millions of Texans who are drivers who interact with DPS, and many \nother Texans who regularly support and vote for candidates affiliated with the Democratic Party. \n12.  Plaintiff DSCC is the national senatorial committee of the Democratic Party, as \ndefined by 52 U.S.C.  30101(14), and its mission is to elect candidates of the Democratic Party \n§ \nto the United States Senate, including in Texas. DSCC works to accomplish its mission across the \ncountry  and in  Texas by, among  other things,  assisting state parties  throughout the  country, \nincluding in Texas.  In 2018, DSCC made contributions and expenditures in the tens of millions \nof dollars to persuade and mobilize voters to support Democratic Senate candidates.  In 2020, \nDSCC expects to invest millions in support of the Democratic candidate selected as the nominee \nto  run  against Republican  Senator  John  Comyn. Texas's  conduct  directly harms DSCC  by \nfrustrating its mission of, and efforts in, electing the Democratic Party candidate to the U.S. Senate \nin Texas by suppressing the access of eligible Texas citizens to the franchise. DSCC is aware of \nTexas's online portal system and will have to expend and divert additional funds and resources on \nensuring that eligible citizens are not misled into believing that they have effectively registered to \nvote, and are in fact registered to vote, as well as to support GOTV, voter persuasion efforts, and \n4 \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 137   Filed 01/21/20   Page 5 of 12\nother activities in Texas, at the expense of its other efforts to defeat Senator Cornyn, as well as its \nefforts in other states, to combat the effects of Texas's conduct. \n13.  Plaintiff DCCC is the national congressional committee of the Democratic Party, \nas defined by 52 U.S.C.  30101(14). DCCC's mission is electing Democratic candidates to the \n§ \nU.S. House of Representatives from congressional districts across the United States, including \nfrom Texas's 36 congressional districts. DCCC works to accomplish its mission across the country \nand in Texas by, among other things, assisting state parties throughout the country, including in \nTexas in its efforts to elect Democrats to public office.  Tn 2018, DCCC made contributions and \nexpenditures  in  the tens  of millions  of dollars  to persuade  and  mobilize  voters  to  support \nDemocratic  congressional  candidatesseveral million  dollars of which were  spent for those \npurposes in Texas. For 2020, DCCC has identified at least eight congressional districts in Texas \n(Congressional Districts 7, 10, 21, 22, 23, 24, 31, and 32) as targeted races, in which it will expend \nresources to support the  Democratic candidate, including  specifically through expenditures on \nvoter registration efforts. Overall, in 2020, DCCC expects to make contributions and expenditures \nin the millions of dollars to persuade and mobilize voters to support Democratic candidates in \ncongressional  elections  around the country, including  in Texas.  Defendants' conduct  directly \nharms DCCC by forcing DCCC to spend additional money on voter registration instead of other \ncritical priorities. Defendants' conduct also frustrates DCCC mission of, and efforts in, electing \nDemocratic Party candidates to the U.S. Congress in Texas by suppressing the access of eligible \nTexas citizens to the franchise. DCCC is aware of Texas's unconstitutional online portal system \nand will have to expend and divert additional funds and resources on voter registration and on \nensuring that eligible citizens are not misled into believing that they have effectively registered to \nvote when they have not. Additional resources will need to be allocated to these efforts at the \n5 \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 137   Filed 01/21/20   Page 6 of 12\nexpense of DCCC's other efforts to elect Democrats to Congress from Texas, as well as its efforts \nin other states, in order to combat the effects of Defendants' conduct. \n14.  Defendant RUTH HUGHS is sued in her official capacity as the Secretary of State \nof Texas. The Secretary is a person within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and acts under color \nof state law in her official capacity. The Secretary's official responsibilities include serving as the \nChief Election Officer for Texas, assisting county election officials and ensuring the uniform \napplication and interpretation of election  laws throughout Texas. See Tex. Elec.  Code Ann.  § \n31.001(a).  As the head  of the Elections  Division of her office, the Secretary is  charged with \nadministering the Texas Election Code. \n15.  Defendant STEVEN C.  MCCRAW is the Director of DPS,  and is sued  in his \nofficial capacity. DPS is Texas' motor vehicle bureau. DPS operates offices around the state, issues \ndriver's licenses and other state identification cards, and is responsible under state and federal law \nfor providing voter registration services and transmitting voter registration information to the \nTexas Secretary of State. See 52 U.S.C. §  20503-20504; Tex. Elec. Code Ann. §  20.063, 20.066. \nSTATEMENT OF FACTS AND LAW \nA. The Fourteenth Amendment \n16.  The Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause is implicated any time a \nstate subjects voters to disparate treatment or places arbitrary restrictions upon the right to vote. \nU.S. Const. amend. XIV, § 1. \n17.  There is no \"litmus test for measuring the severity of a burden that a state law \nimposes on.  an individual voter, or a discrete class of voters. However slight that burden may \n.  . \nappear,  it must be justified by relevant and legitimate state interests 'sufficiently weighty to \n.  .  . \njustiIi the limitation.\" Crawford v. Marion Cly. ElectionBd., 553 U.S. 181, 191 (2008) (Stevens, \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 137   Filed 01/21/20   Page 7 of 12\nJ., announcing judgment of Court); accord ObamaforAm. v. Husted, 697 F.3d 423, 429 (6th Cir. \n2012)  (\"When a plaintiff alleges that a state has burdened  voting rights through the disparate \ntreatment of voters,  we review the claim using the flexible standard outlined  in Anderson v. \nCelebrezze  courts must weigh the burden on voters against the state's asserted justifications \n.  .  . \nand make the hard judgment that our adversary system demands.\" (quotation marks and citations \nomitted)). \nB. Texas Election Code \n18.  Texas state law specifies that DPS must use \"a form and procedure that combines \nthe department's  application  form  for  a  license  or  card  with  an  officially prescribed  voter \nregistration application form.\" Tex. Elec. Code Ann. § 20.062(a). \n19.  DPS must also provide a \"change of address form and procedure that combines \ndepartment and voter registration functions,\" id. § 20.062(b), so that when a voter submits a change \nof address, that \"serves as a change of address for voter registration\" as well, unless the individual \nindicates otherwise. Id.  20.063(c). \n§ \n20.  In addition, if a \"correct driver's license number or personal identification card \nnumber\" or  if \"correct residence address or mailing address\"  information  is  missing from  a \nregistration  application,  DPS  employees  have  a  duty  to  correct  the  voter's  application  by \n\"enter[ing] the information on the application.\" Id. § 20.063(d). \n21.  Finally,  voter  registration  applications  and  change-of-address  forms  must  be \npromptly delivered to election officials. Specifically, \"[n]ot later than the fifth day after the date a \nperson completes  a voter registration  application and provides  an electronic  signature to  the \ndepartment, [DPS] shall electronically transfer the applicant's voter registration data, including the \napplicant's signature, to the [Texas Secretary of State].\" Id.  § 20.066(b); see also id. § 20.065. \n7 \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 137   Filed 01/21/20   Page 8 of 12\nC. DPS  does  not provide  simultaneous  voter  registration  with  online transactions \ndespite doing so with mail and in-person transactions \n22.  DPS's in-person driver's license applications, ECF No.  93,  exh. A-7,  in-person \nrenewal/replacement/change  of address forms, ECF No.  93, exh. A-8,  and mail in change-of- \naddress forms, ECF No. 93, ex. A-9, serve as simultaneous voter registration applications. \n23.  DPS encourages Texans to use a number of online services through its website, \nwww.txdps.state.tx.us,  an official governmental website for the State of Texas. \n24.  DPS invites  many Texas driver's license holders to renew their license and/or \nupdate the address information associated with their license online through a portion of its website \nentitled \"Driver License Renewal, Replacement, Change of Address or Change of Emergency \nContacts,\" available at https ://txapps.texas.gov/tolapp/txdl/. \n25.  This website page provides a single online portal for qualified holders of a Texas \ndriver's license to renew their driver's licenses, update the address listed on their driver's licenses, \nor both. \n26.  The online process involves nine \"Steps to Complete,\" including the following \nsteps: Welcome, Login, Select Services, Enter Address, Select Options, Review Order, Submit \nPayment, Emergency Contacts, and Receipt. \n27.  Unlike Defendants' simultaneous voter registration services for license renewal or \naddress update applications submitted in-person at a DPS office or through the mail, Defendants \ndo not provide for simultaneous voter registration at any point during the online license renewal \nor  address  update  process.  Instead  of providing  any  simultaneous  opportunity  for  voter \nregistration, the DPS website directs voters to an entirely different website, where voters must \ncomplete an online application, print it out, sign it, and mail it to their county voter registrar to \nensure their ability to vote in upcoming elections. \n8 \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 137   Filed 01/21/20   Page 9 of 12\n28.  Even though Defendants refuse to use information from online change-of-address \ntransactions to properly register voters at their new addresses, they are certainly capable of using \nthis information to do so. In fact, Defendants may use the same online information to cancel a \nvoter's prior registration record even though they fail to give voters any notice of this possibility. \nSee Tex. Elec. Code Ann. § 16.03 1. \nD. Defendants' Voter Registration Failures Harm Countless Texas Voters \n29.  As  a result of Defendants'  failure to register eligible voters equally,  countless \neligible Texas residents have been denied the right to voter registration. \n30.  According  to  data  already  in  the  factual  record  before  this  Court,  between \nSeptember 2013  and February 2015, the Secretary's Elections Division confirmed over 1,700 \nincidents reported by voters who checked \"yes\" on their drivers'  license applications at DPS, \nindicating they wanted to register to vote at that time, but did not appear on the voter rolls. ECF \nNo. 1-4 at 7. \n31.  The voters who complained almost certainly represent just a fraction of the total \naffected during that time frame. Indeed, the State's records capture only those voters who contacted \nelection workers, specifically complained about registration problems at DPS, and had their files \ninvestigated  surely, not all affected voters complained; others may have reported problems but \nhad their complaints disregarded by election workers. Further, this data comes from just 123 of \nTexas' 254 counties, strongly suggesting that the data set itself is incomplete. See ECF No. 1-3; \nECF No. 1-4 at 9. \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 137   Filed 01/21/20   Page 10 of 12\nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nCOUNT I \nViolation of Fourteenth Amendment: Disparate Treatment \nU.S. Const. amend. XIV; 42 U.S.C. § 1983; 28 U.S.C. §  2201, 2202 \n32.  Intervenor-Plaintiffs  reallege  and  incorporate  by  reference  all  previous  and \nsubsequent paragraphs as though set forth herein. \n33.  By arbitrarily subjecting eligible voters to disparate voter registration standards, \nDefendants have denied voters an equal opportunity to participate in federal and state elections in \nviolation of Section  of the Fourteenth Amendment. As a result of this disparate treatment, \n1 \nIntervenor-Plaintiffs were directly harmed in their mission to elect Democratic representatives, \nand those among their membership harmed through disenfranchisement. \n34.  No legitimate state interest could justify the state's differential treatment, which \ncreates arbitrary distinctions among Texas voters based on how they choose to interact with DPS. \n35.  Absent relief, DSCC, DCCC, and TDP along with its members and constituents, \nwill be denied an equal opportunity to participate in Texas's elections. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Intervenor-Plaintiffs respectfully request this Court enter judgment: \n(a)  declaring,  under the authority  granted to this  Court by 28 U.S.C.  § 2201, that \nDefendants have violated Section  of the Fourteenth  Amendment by denying \n1 \nvoters an equal opportunity to participate in federal and state elections; \n(b)  permanently  enjoining Defendants, their respective agents, officers, employees, \nand successors, and all persons acting in concert with each or any of them, from \nimplementing practices  and procedures  that  likewise  violate  Section  1  of the \nFourteenth Amendment; \n(c)  directing Defendants, under a court-approved plan with appropriate reporting and \nmonitoring requirements, to take all appropriate measures necessary to remedy the \nharm  caused by their violation, including, but not  limited to providing  for the \nelectronic  transfer  of voter  registration  information  collected  through  online \ntransactions to the Secretary of State, similar to the existing system to transfer voter \nregistration information collected through in-person transactions; \n10 \n\nCase 5:16-cv-00257-OLG   Document 137   Filed 01/21/20   Page 11 of 12\n(d)  awarding Intervenor-Plaintiffs their costs, disbursements, and reasonable attorneys' \nfees incurred in bringing this action under 42 U.S.C. § 1988 and other applicable \nlaws; \n(e)  retaining jurisdiction over this action to ensure that Defendants continue to comply \nwith their obligations under Section  of the Fourteenth Amendment; and \n1 \n(f)  granting such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper. \nDated: December 20, 2019.

McCRAW, in his official \ncapacity as Director of the Texas Department \nof Public Safety \nJARROD STRINGER, et. al. \nV. \nRUTH HUGHS, in her official capacity  CIVIL NO. SA-20-CV-46-OG \nas Texas Secretary of State and STEVEN C. \nMcCRAW, in his official capacity as \nDirector of the Texas Department of \nPublic Safety \nORDER \nOn January 17, 2020, Plaintiffs filed an Emergency Application for Preliminary Injunction and \n51 \nRequest for Hearing. Docket no.  On January 27, 2020, Defendants Hughs and McCraw filed a \nresponse. Docket no.  146.2 On January 28, 2020, Plaintiff-Intervenors filed a motion to join in the \nmotion for preliminary injunction, and their motion to join was granted. Docket no. 150. The same day, \nPlaintiffs filed their reply and supplemented their evidence. Docket no. 154. The Court held a hearing \non January 28, 2020. \nAfter filing their motion, Plaintiffs significantly narrowed the temporary injunctive relief they \nare seeking. Within that scope of relief, the continuing injury and/or threatened future injury suffered \nby the individual plaintiffs was the most Urgent, given the February 3 deadline to register to vote. Thus, \n1Docketed in 20-CV-46. \n2Docketed in 1 6-CV-257. Unless stated otherwise, all docket references are to the docket in 1 6-CV-257. \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 47   Filed 02/03/20   Page 2 of 3\nthe Court first considered, and granted, the very narrow temporary relief sought by the three individual \nplaintiffs. Docket no. 156.  The urgency of the temporary relief already granted does not minimize the \nimminent nature of the relief still being sought. However, because the remaining relief being sought had \nproposed deadlines in March 2020, the Court found it prudent to first address the relief that had a \nFebruary 3 deadline. \nThe relief ultimately sought by Plaintiffs and Intervenor-Plaintiffs is full compliance with the \nNVRA. In Stringer I, Defendants represented to the Court that implementation of corrective measures \nto come into compliance is technologically feasible and would take approximately 90 days. See docket \nno. 109 n. i.  The temporary injunctive relief movants are currently proposing is much less than full \ncompliance. It appears to be an interim measure that would not fix the NVRA violations being asserted \nherein but may alleviate, to some extent, the concern that persons who engage in online transactions \nwith DPS remain unregistered to vote. See docket no. 152, proposed amended order. At the hearing, \ndefense counsel indicated that Defendants do not fully understand what movants are seeking, but \nnevertheless indicated that they would not agree to such interim measure. Additionally, defense counsel \nstated that \"what they're asking here is not a matter of weeks. It's a matter of months if not a year if not \nmore.\" Tr. 47. It is difficult to believe that full compliance with the NYRA could be accomplished in \n90 days, yet this interim measure would take months, a year, or more. What does seem clear is that both \nsides should meet and confer to discuss this proposed interim measure with persons in attendance who \nunderstand the technology that would be required and can determine, with reasonable accuracy, how \nlong it would take to implement this type of interim measure. After meeting, conferring, and considering \nthis or similar interim measures, both sides must provide the Court with sworn declaration(s) from \nperson(s) who can attest to the feasability of this (or similar) interim measures and the length of time \nit would take to implement this or similar interim measures. \n3Although judgment was vacated, Defendants' representations are part of the record. \n2 \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 47   Filed 02/03/20   Page 3 of 3\nIt is therefore ORDERED that the parties meet and confer on or before February 7, 2020 to \ndiscuss this proposed or similar interim measure with persons in attendance (on both sides) who \nunderstand the technology that would be required and can determine, with reasonable accuracy, how \nlong it would take to implement this type of interim measure. After meeting, conferring, and considering \nthis or similar interim measures, both sides must provide the Court with sworn declaration(s)  from \nperson(s) who can attest to the feasability of this (or similar) interim measures and the length of time \nit would take to implement this or similar interim measures. These sworn declarations must be filed on \nor before February 10, 2020. \nIt is further ORDERED that for the duration of this case, Defendants must track, retain, and \npreserve the information that the Court requested in paragraphs 5d and Se of its order entered on \nJanuary 24, 2020. Docket no. 141. It is highly relevant to the issues herein, and Defendants' decision \nnot to track, record, or preserve such information at this juncture, after four years of litigation, is \nconcerning.

After the State still \nrefused to comply, several Texas voters, including Jarrod Stringer, filed suit (“Stringer I”). After \nyears of litigation and untold amounts of wasted taxpayer dollars, the State remains steadfast in its \nrefusal to correct these failures—despite having the funds and technologic ability to do so. To this \nday, the NVRA rights of nearly 1.5 million Texans are violated each year, each time one of those \nindividuals interacts online with the Department of Public Safety (“DPS”) driver’s license system \nto renew or update their license. \n \n1 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046   Document 1   Filed 01/14/20   Page 2 of 23\n \n \n  Under the NVRA, each time an eligible resident obtains, renews, or updates his or \nher  driver’s  license  with  DPS,  the  State  must  ensure  that  the  driver’s  license  application \nsimultaneously serves as a voter registration application.1  In 2018, Chief Judge Orlando Garcia \nruled on cross motions for summary judgment in Stringer I, finding, inter alia,  \nThe NVRA’s requirement that DPS, a voter registration agency, provide a \nsimultaneous application for both driver’s license and voter registration \npurposes is plain and unambiguous and the facts in the record confirm that \nTexans are being deprived of this statutory right. \n \nStringer v. Pablos, 320 F. Supp. 3d 862, 891 (W.D. Tex. 2018), rev’d and remanded sub \nnom. \n  \n  In accordance with this finding, the Court entered judgment enjoining the State’s \nongoing NVRA violations. The State appealed and, in November of 2019, the Fifth Circuit Court \nof Appeals reversed Judge Garcia’s decision, finding that the plaintiffs failed to satisfy standing \nrequirements. Notably, the Fifth Circuit did not disturb the merits of the lower court’s decision. \nIndeed, Judge James Ho wrote in his concurrence:  \n. . . Plaintiffs have indeed endured an injury . . . they were unable to exercise \ntheir right to vote in past election cycles. And it is a right they will never be \nable to recover. As citizens, we can hope it is a deprivation they will not \nexperience again . . .  \n \nStringer v. Whitley, 942 F.3d 715, 726 (5th Cir. 2019) (Ho, J., concurring). \n \n  And yet, it has happened again to Mr. Stringer, and to countless other Texas voters. \nThe State still is not compliant with its obligations under 52 U.S.C. § 20504, meaning that millions \nof Texans are still denied their right to register to vote when they use DPS’s online system.  As a \nresult, large numbers of eligible Texas voters either did not appear on the voter rolls or appeared \nwith incorrect address information when they attempted to exercise their franchise in 2018—and \n                                                 \n1 52 U.S.C. § 20503(a)(1). \n2 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046   Document 1   Filed 01/14/20   Page 3 of 23\n \n \nwere disenfranchised as a result. Countless more stand to be similarly impacted during the primary \nand general elections in 2020.  \n  The  Individual  and  Organizational  Plaintiffs  here  now  file  this  lawsuit, \ndemonstrating the ongoing nature of the State’s violation of the NVRA and the United States \nConstitution, as well as Plaintiffs’ current and ongoing injuries due to those violations. \nNVRA Background \n \n  In  1993,  after  finding  that  “discriminatory  and  unfair  registration  laws  and \nprocedures  can  have  a  direct  and  damaging  effect  on  voter  participation,”  and  that  state \ngovernments have a “duty” to promote voting and voter registration, Congress enacted the NVRA \nto “establish procedures that will increase the number of eligible citizens who register to vote in \nelections for Federal office.” 52 U.S.C. § 20501. Through its so-called “Motor Voter” provisions, \n52 U.S.C. § 20504, the NVRA imposes voter registration obligations on state motor vehicle \nbureaus. Specifically, each time an eligible resident obtains, renews, or updates his or her driver’s \nlicense with DPS, Texas’s motor vehicle bureau, the State must ensure that the driver’s license \napplication simultaneously serves as an application to register to vote or to update the voter’s \nregistration record. 52 U.S.C. § 20504(a)(1). \n  The Motor Voter provisions require DPS to simultaneously treat: (a) “each . . .  \ndriver’s license application (including any renewal application)” as an “application for voter \nregistration,” 52 U.S.C. § 20504(a)(1); and (b) “any change of address form” as a “notification of \nchange of address for voter registration.” 52 U.S.C. § 20504(d). Defendants have a legal duty to \nensure that every eligible voter who submits a driver’s license application or renewal, or updates \nhis or her address with DPS not less than 30 days before an election, is registered to vote. 52 U.S.C. \n§ 20507(a)(1)(A).  \n3 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046   Document 1   Filed 01/14/20   Page 4 of 23\n \n \n  The Motor Voter provisions apply to “each” renewal application and “any” change \nof address form submitted to DPS, unless the applicant “fails to sign the voter registration \napplication” or “states on the form that the change of address is not for voter registration purposes.” \n52 U.S.C. § 20504(a)(1). Accordingly, outside of those two narrow exceptions, all driver’s license \ntransactions are covered by the Motor Voter law, regardless of the method by which an applicant \napplies, renews, or updates his or her driver’s license—the NVRA does not discriminate against \napplicants who choose one transaction method over another. Online renewals and change-of-\naddress transactions are thus expressly covered by the NVRA’s plain text.   \nTexas’s System \n \n  The State of Texas permits certain Texas driver’s license holders to renew their \nlicense  and/or  update  the  address  on  their  license  online  on  DPS’s  website  at \nhttps://txapps.texas.gov/tolapp/txdl/. When these individuals wish to register to vote or update \ntheir voter registration through the same application, they are unable to do so. Rather, at the end \nof the online driver’s license transaction, the applicant is sent to a page on the Secretary of State’s \nwebsite (https://webservices.sos.state.tx.us/vrapp/index.asp)—which is altogether separate and \ndistinct from the DPS online system—and is there required to fill out a new form with duplicate \ninformation, print that form, and then sign and mail it to the proper authority, all before becoming \nregistered  to  vote.  Defendants  fail  to  offer  any  means  for  simultaneous  voter  registration \napplication and fail to update the voter registration records of individuals who change their driver’s \nlicense address through DPS’s online system.  \n  In addition to violating the NVRA, Defendants’ current practices treat similarly \nsituated driver’s license applicants differently based solely on how those applicants choose to \ntransact with DPS. The NVRA makes no distinction between transaction methods and cannot be \n4 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046   Document 1   Filed 01/14/20   Page 5 of 23\n \n \nused to justify such arbitrary discrimination, which offends basic notions of equal protection under \nlaw.   \n  It is particularly important that state officials in Texas adhere to the address update \nrequirements of 52 U.S.C. § 20504. The U.S. Census Bureau estimates that between 2013 and \n2017, more than 2.5 million Texans moved within the same county, and more than 1 million \nTexans  moved  from  one  Texas  county  to  another  Texas  county.  United  States  Census \nBureau, County-to-County Migration Flows: 2013-2017 ACS, Census.gov (last revised Aug. 22, \n2019),  https://www.census.gov/data/tables/2017/demo/geographic-mobility/county-to-county-\nmigration-2013-2017.html.  \n  The failure to update an applicant’s voter registration address has devastating \nconsequences on their right to cast a ballot. Each year, almost 1.5 million Texans use DPS’s online \ndriver’s license system. Exhibit A contains a document produced by DPS as Ex. 3-Y to the Mar. 7, \n2017 30(b)(6) Deposition of DPS taken in Stringer I, showing 1,448,941 customers transacted with \nDPS online in 2016. Would-be voters who show up to vote in their new precinct or county but \nwhose registration has not been updated due to Defendants’ failure to treat their online driver’s \nlicense transaction as a registration application will either be completely disenfranchised or forced \nto cast a limited ballot. \n  JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n  This case arises under the U.S. Constitution and the NVRA, a law of the United \nStates. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction of this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331 and \n28 U.S.C. § 1343(a)(4). \n  Defendants have received detailed notice of these violations of federal law and have \nfailed to correct the violations alleged herein within 20 days. Plaintiffs therefore have a private \nright of action under 52 U.S.C. § 20510(b) to enforce the NVRA and may file suit after 20 days’ \n5 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046   Document 1   Filed 01/14/20   Page 6 of 23\n \n \nnotice pursuant to 52 U.S.C. § 20510(b)(2)(1). Exhibit B contains the original notice provided to \nDefendants on December 19, 2019. \n  This Court has jurisdiction to grant both declaratory and injunctive relief pursuant \nto 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 and 2202. \n  This Court has personal jurisdiction over Defendants because each is a citizen of \nthe State of Texas. \n  Venue is proper because a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to \nthe claim occurred in this district, and each Defendant conducts business in this district. 28 U.S.C. \n§ 1391(b). \nPARTIES \nPlaintiffs \n  Plaintiff Jarrod Stringer is an eligible Texas voter who is directly and individually \nharmed by Defendants’ conduct.  As a result of Defendants’ failure to comply with the NVRA, \nMr. Stringer is being denied his federal right to register to vote through an online transaction with \nDPS. He is thus denied the right to voter registration that is guaranteed by the NVRA and denied \nan equal opportunity to participate in a federal election—for no reason other than the method \nthrough which he transacted with DPS.  \n  Plaintiff Nayeli Gomez is an eligible Texas voter who is directly and individually \nharmed by Defendants’ conduct.  As a result of Defendants’ failure to comply with the NVRA, \nMs. Gomez is being denied her federal right to register to vote through an online transaction with \nDPS. She is thus denied the right to voter registration that is guaranteed by the NVRA and denied \nan equal opportunity to participate in a federal election—for no reason other than the method \nthrough which she transacted with DPS.  \n6 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046   Document 1   Filed 01/14/20   Page 7 of 23\n \n \n  Plaintiff John Harms is an eligible Texas voter who is directly and individually \nharmed by Defendants’ conduct.  As a result of Defendants’ failure to comply with the NVRA, \nMr. Harms is being denied his federal right to register to vote through an online transaction with \nDPS. He is thus denied the right to voter registration that is guaranteed by the NVRA and denied \nan equal opportunity to participate in a federal election—for no reason other than the method \nthrough which he transacted with DPS.  \n  Plaintiff MOVE Texas Civic Fund (“MOVE Texas”) is a non-profit organization, \ntax exempt under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Review Code, with its principal place of \nbusiness in San Antonio, Texas.  MOVE Texas is a grassroots nonpartisan, nonprofit organization \nbuilding  power  in  underrepresented  youth  communities  through  civic  education,  leadership \ndevelopment, and issue advocacy.  MOVE Texas conducts voter registration in multiple counties \nin Texas, including on college campuses, where MOVE Texas employees and volunteers offer \ncollege students and other would-be voters the opportunity to register to vote.  During and in the \nlead up to federal, state and local elections MOVE Texas also conducts get-out-the-vote efforts. \n  Plaintiff the League of Women Voters of Texas (“LWVTX”) is a non-profit \norganization, tax exempt under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, with its principal \nplace of business in Austin, Texas. LWVTX’s mission includes empowering voters, defending \ndemocracy, and envisioning a democracy where every person has the desire, the right, the \nknowledge, and the confidence to participate. LWVTX registers eligible individuals to vote across \nTexas.  LWVTX has members and chapters across the state.  During and in the lead up to federal, \nstate and local elections LWVTX also conducts voter education and get-out-the-vote efforts. \n \n \n \n \n7 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046   Document 1   Filed 01/14/20   Page 8 of 23\n \n \nDefendants \n  Defendants are state officials charged with ensuring Texas’s compliance with 52 \nU.S.C. § 20504. \n  Defendant Ruth Hughs is the Texas Secretary of State and is sued in her official \ncapacity. As Secretary of State, Hughs serves as Texas’s Chief Election Officer. Tex. Elec. Code \n§  31.001(a).  Each  state’s  chief  election  official  is  responsible  for  coordinating  that  state’s \ncompliance with the NVRA. 52 U.S.C. § 20509.  \n  Defendant Steven C. McCraw is the Director of DPS and is sued in his official \ncapacity. DPS is Texas’s motor vehicle bureau. DPS operates offices around the state, issues \ndriver’s licenses and other state identification cards, and is responsible under state and federal law \nfor providing voter registration services and transmitting voter registration information to the \nTexas Secretary of State. See 52 U.S.C. §§ 20503-20504; Tex. Elec. Code §§ 20.063, 20.066. \nAPPLICABLE LAW \nThe First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution \n  The First and Fourteenth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution are implicated \nanytime a state law, policy, or practice burdens the fundamental right to vote. See, e.g., Burdick v. \nTakushi, 504 U.S. 428, 433 (1992) (quoting Anderson v. Celebrezze, 460 U.S. 780, 789 (1983)) \n(“A court considering a state election law challenge ‘must weigh the character and magnitude of \nthe asserted injury to the First and Fourteenth Amendment rights that the plaintiff seeks to \nvindicate against the precise interests put forward by the State as justification for the burden \nimposed by its rule.’”). \n  There is no “litmus test for measuring the severity of a burden that a state law \nimposes on . . . an individual voter, or a discrete class of voters. However slight that burden may \n8 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046   Document 1   Filed 01/14/20   Page 9 of 23\n \n \nappear, . . . it must be justified by relevant and legitimate state interests ‘sufficiently weighty to \njustify the limitation.’” Crawford v. Marion County Election Board, 553 U.S. 181, 191 (2008) \n(Stevens, J., announcing judgment of Court); accord Obama for America v. Husted, 697 F.3d 423, \n429 (6th Cir. 2012) (“When a plaintiff alleges that a state has burdened voting rights through the \ndisparate treatment of voters, we review the claim using the flexible standard outlined in Anderson \nv. Celebrezze . . . courts must weigh the burden on voters against the state’s asserted justifications \nand make the hard judgment that our adversary system demands.” (internal quotation marks and \ncitations omitted)).  \n  Further, as referenced by Judge Garcia in Stringer I, “[w]hile the State can impose \nreasonable restrictions, those restrictions must be justified by specific interests that outweigh the \nburden  on  voters.  The  undisputed  facts  show  that  Defendants  permit  simultaneous  voter \napplications for motor voters that renew or change their driver's license in person or by mail, but \nrefuse simultaneous voter applications for motor voters that renew or change their driver's license \nonline.” Stringer I, 320 F. Supp. 3d at 899 (W.D. Tex. 2018). \nNational Voter Registration Act of 1993 \n  A principal purpose of the NVRA is to “increase the number of eligible citizens \nwho register to vote.” 52 U.S.C. § 20501(b)(1); Ferrand v. Schedler, No. 11-926, 2012 WL \n1570094 at *10 (E.D. La. May 3, 2012) (citing H.R. Rep. No. 103–66, at 19 (1993) (Conf. Rep.), \nreprinted in 1993 U.S.C.C.A.N. 140, 144); Ass’n of Cmty. Organizations for Reform Now v. \nFowler, 178 F.3d 350, 354 (5th Cir. 1999). A Senate Report on the law “makes clear that, in \nimplementing the NVRA, the ‘[g]overnment should do all it can to make registration widely and \neasily available.’” Ferrand v. Schedler, No. 11-926, 2012 WL 1570094 at *11 (E.D. La. May 3, \n2012) (citing S. Rep. No. 103–6, at 14 (1993)). \n9 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046   Document 1   Filed 01/14/20   Page 10 of 23\n \n \n  The NVRA’s “Motor Voter” provisions were meant to streamline the federal voter \nregistration process and increase voter registration accessibility: \n[I]ncorporating voter registration into the drivers licensing process \nprovides a secure and convenient method for registering voters; an \neffective means of reaching groups of individuals generally considered \nhard-to-reach for voting purposes . . .; and a procedure for keeping rolls \ncurrent through contact with licensees who change addresses.  \n \nS. Rep. 103-6, at 5 (1993). \n \n  Indeed, under the Motor Voter provisions, each time an eligible Texas applicant \nobtains,  renews,  or  updates  his  or  her  driver’s  license  with  DPS,  the  State  must  provide \nsimultaneous voter registration application or update that applicant’s voter registration records, \nunless  the  person  fails  to  sign  the  registration  form  or  attests  that  the  change-of-address \ninformation is not for voter registration purposes. 52 U.S.C. §§ 20503, 20504, 20507.  \n  In relevant part, 52 U.S.C § 20504 provides that: \nEach  State  motor  vehicle  driver’s  license  application  (including  any \nrenewal  application)  submitted  to  the  appropriate  State  motor  vehicle \nauthority under State law shall serve as an application for voter registration \nwith respect to elections for Federal office unless the applicant fails to sign \nthe voter registration application . . . any change of address form submitted \nin accordance with State law for purposes of a State motor vehicle driver’s \nlicense shall serve as notification of change of address for voter registration \nwith respect to elections for Federal office for the registrant involved unless \nthe registrant states on the form that the change of address is not for voter \nregistration purposes.  \n \n  The State may not “require any information that duplicates information required in \nthe driver’s license portion of the form,” other than extra information expressly enumerated by \nstatute. Id. at § 20504(c)(2)(A). Instead, the NVRA demands that eligible applicants shall be \nregistered to vote “simultaneously” with the submission of any driver’s license application, \nrenewal or change-of-address form. See id. at § 20503(a)(1)(1).  \n10 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046   Document 1   Filed 01/14/20   Page 11 of 23\n \n \n  DPS must promptly transmit completed voter registration applications and change-\nof-address information to election officials. Generally, transmission must occur no later than 10 \ndays after receipt. See id. at § 20504(e). \nTexas Election Code \n  Shortly after the NVRA was enacted in 1993, the State of Texas updated the Texas \nElection Code to reinforce the NVRA’s Motor Voter mandates. See generally Tex. Elec. Code \n§§ 20.061-66. \n  For instance, state law specifies that DPS must use “a form and procedure that \ncombines the department’s application form for a license or card with an officially prescribed voter \nregistration application form.” Id. at § 20.062(a).   \n  DPS must also provide a “change of address form and procedure that combines \ndepartment and voter registration functions,” so that when a voter submits a change of address, \nthat “serves as a change of address for voter registration” as well, unless the individual indicates \notherwise. Id. at § 20.063(c); id. at § 20.062(a).  \n  In addition, if a “correct driver’s license number or personal identification card \nnumber” or if “correct residence address or mailing address” information is missing from a \nregistration application, DPS employees have a duty to correct the applicant’s application by \n“enter[ing] the information on the application.” Id. at § 20.063(d). \n  Finally,  voter  registration  applications  and  change-of-address  forms  must  be \npromptly delivered to election officials. Specifically, “[n]ot later than the fifth day after the date a \nperson completes a voter registration application and provides an electronic signature to the \ndepartment, [DPS] shall electronically transfer the applicant’s voter registration data, including the \napplicant’s signature, to the [Texas Secretary of State].” Id. at § 20.066; see also id. at § 20.065.  \n11 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046   Document 1   Filed 01/14/20   Page 12 of 23\n \n \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \n  Exhibit B contains the original notice provided to Defendants on December 19, \n2019. The factual allegations set forth in those letters are incorporated by reference in this \nComplaint.  \nDPS Does Not Provide Simultaneous Voter Registration with Online Transactions \n  DPS encourages Texans to use its online services to renew and change the address \non their driver’s licenses. Stringer I, 320 F. Supp. 3d at 900 (W.D. Tex. 2018). \n  DPS’s Driver License Renewal and Change of Address website page provides a \nsingle, combined online interface for qualified holders of a Texas driver’s license to renew their \ndriver’s licenses, update the address listed on their driver’s licenses, or both. Stringer I, 320 F. \nSupp. 3d at n.10 (W.D. Tex. 2018). \n  The online process involves eight “Steps to Complete,” including the following \nsteps: Welcome, Login, Select Services, Enter Address, Select Options, Review Order, Submit \nPayment, and Receipt. See Exhibit C, which contain screen shots from the online DPS system. \n  Applicants are never given the opportunity to tell the State whether they want to \nregister to vote. See Exhibit C at 5. Rather, when they reach Step 5 of this online process, the \nwebsite prompts the applicants to answer whether they want to download a separate voter \nregistration application. Id. If an eligible applicant checks “yes” to this question, Defendants \nmerely provide a link to a website maintained by SOS, a wholly different and distinct website from \nDPS’s online driver’s license application. See Exhibit C at 10. The SOS website prompts the \napplicant to fill out an entirely new form with duplicative information, print, sign, and mail the \nform to the proper voter registration authority. See Exhibit C at 11-17; see also Stringer I, 320 F. \n12 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046   Document 1   Filed 01/14/20   Page 13 of 23\n \n \nSupp.  3d  at  876-77  (W.D.  Tex.  2018).  This  process  is  anything  but  a  simultaneous  voter \nregistration application process.   \n  Additionally,  this  process  stands  in  stark  contrast  to  DPS’s  procedures  for \nregistering eligible Texas residents who renew a driver’s license and/or update address information \nthrough  non-online  processes.  “DPS’s  in-person  driver's  license  applications…in-person \nrenewal/replacement/change of address forms . . ., and mail-in change of address forms . . . \ncurrently serve as simultaneous voter registration applications as required under the NVRA.” \nStringer I, 320 F. Supp. 3d at 871 (W.D. Tex. 2018) (internal citations omitted). \n  Between April 2013 and February 26, 2016, Step 5 of the online renewal and \nchange of address interface prompted the applicant to select “yes” or “no” beneath the statement \n“I want to register to vote. Selecting ‘yes’ does not register you to vote. A link to the [SOS] voter \nwebsite (where a voter application may be downloaded or requested) will be available on your \nreceipt page.” (emphasis original) Stringer I, 320 F. Supp. 3d at 869 (W.D. Tex. 2018). \n  Between September 2013 and May 26, 2015, the State recorded complaints from \nmore than 1,800 voters who completed an online transaction with DPS and mistakenly believed \nthat their registration records were updated too. Exhibit D, Response to Public Information Act \nRequest  from  Lindsey  E.  Wolf  to  Mimi  Marziani  (March  02,  2015)  (providing  record  of \ncomplaints  made  to  the  State  about  confusion  over  dual  driver’s  license/voter  registration \ntransactions).  \n  Even after 2016, when the state changed the language regarding voter registration \non the online driver’s license application, many individuals were and are confused by the online \ndriver’s license portal system and mistakenly believed or believe they registered to vote when \ncompleting their DPS transaction.  \n13 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046   Document 1   Filed 01/14/20   Page 14 of 23\n \n \n \nDefendants’ Conduct Injures Each Individual Plaintiff \n \n  The State’s violations of the NVRA have harmed Plaintiff Jarrod Stringer multiple \ntimes. Mr. Stringer initially filed a lawsuit against the State in 2016. After moving from Arlington \nto San Antonio, Mr. Stringer updated the address on his driver’s license online using the DPS \nwebsite on August 1, 2014. The State failed to simultaneously update his voter registration, as \nrequired by the NVRA, during Mr. Stringer’s transaction. Due to the confusing setup of the online \ndriver’s license portal, Mr. Stringer, as do countless Texans, mistakenly believed that he had \nupdated his voter registration. As a result of Defendants’ failure to simultaneously register him to \nvote, Mr. Stringer was unable to cast a full ballot in the 2014 General Election.  \n  Mr. Stringer is now, again, being harmed by Defendants’ violations. On or around \nNovember 23, 2019, the State again refused to simultaneously update his voter registration when, \nafter moving from San Antonio to Houston, the address on his driver’s license was updated online \nusing the DPS website. Mr. Stringer remains unregistered to vote in Harris County, his current \ncounty of residence. Further, Mr. Stringer plans to move residences again in 2020. Specifically, \nMr. Stringer and his wife plan to move out of their rental apartment into a new residence by August \n25, 2020 at the latest. When he moves to his new address, Mr. Stringer intends to use the online \nDPS system to update his driver’s license address. \n  Nayeli Gomez is aggrieved by the State’s violations of the NVRA because her voter \nregistration was not simultaneously updated when she updated her driver’s license. On December \n09, 2019, Ms. Gomez updated her driver’s license address online after moving to a new address \nwithin Bexar County. Because it was impossible for her to simultaneously update her voter \nregistration during this transaction, she did not do so. Ms. Gomez remains registered to vote at the \nincorrect address and wishes for her online driver’s license application to serve as a simultaneous \n14 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046   Document 1   Filed 01/14/20   Page 15 of 23\n \n \nvoter registration application. Next time she changes addresses or needs to renew her driver’s \nlicense and is eligible, Ms. Gomez intends to do so through the DPS online system. \n  John Harms is aggrieved by the State’s violations of the NVRA because he was not \noffered the opportunity to simultaneously update his voter registration to his new county of \nresidence when he updated his driver’s license through DPS’s website on or around October 08, \n2019. Mr. Harms updated his driver’s license because he moved from Bastrop County to Travis \nCounty. Because it was impossible for him to simultaneously update his voter registration during \nthis transaction, he did not do so. Mr. Harms remains unregistered to vote in Travis County, his \ncurrent county of residence, and wishes for his online driver’s license application to serve as a \nsimultaneous voter registration application. Next time he changes addresses or needs to renew her \ndriver’s license and is eligible, Mr. Harms intends to do so through the DPS online system. \n  The conduct that harmed Individual Plaintiffs is ongoing. All are being denied, on \na continual basis, their NVRA-protected right to simultaneous voter registration with an online \ndriver’s license transition. Moreover, with just weeks remaining until the voter registration \ndeadline for the March primary elections, none are currently registered to vote at their current \naddress. Defendants have repeatedly maintained that they are unwilling to change the policies and \npractices that caused the injuries described herein. Stringer I, 320 F. Supp. 3d at 884 (W.D. Tex. \n2018); see also Exhibit E, Press Release from Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton (Nov. 14, \n2019).  Since  Defendants  refuse  to  correct  the  violations  at  issue  in  this  lawsuit  for  future \ntransactions, Individual Plaintiffs also face the additional harm of being denied their NVRA-\nprotected right to simultaneous voter registration again when each Individual Plaintiff changes the \naddress on or renews their driver’s license online in the future. \nDefendants’ Conduct Injures Each Organizational Plaintiff \n \n15 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046   Document 1   Filed 01/14/20   Page 16 of 23\n \n \n  Each Organizational Plaintiff is harmed by the State’s failure to comply with the \nNVRA and the Constitution in at least three distinct ways: \n  Organizational Plaintiffs must expend additional resources to register people to \nvote who would have otherwise been able to register to vote or to update their voter registrations \nthrough the DPS’s online driver’s license system,  \n  Organizational  Plaintiffs  must  expend  additional  resources  to  educate  DPS \ncustomers who update the address on and/or renew their driver’s license through the DPS website \nand mistakenly believe their online DPS transaction simultaneously registered them to vote that \nthey are not in fact registered to vote.  \n  Organizational Plaintiffs’ get-out-the-vote efforts are thwarted when a voter whom \nthey convinced to show up to the polls is denied the chance to cast a ballot that counts because \nthey were not registered to vote after an online driver’s license transaction due to the State’s failure \nto comply with the NVRA.  \n  MOVE Texas is a grassroots nonpartisan, nonprofit organization building power in \nunderrepresented youth communities through civic education, leadership development, and issue \nadvocacy.  MOVE Texas conducts voter registration in multiple counties in Texas, including on \ncollege campuses, where MOVE Texas employees and volunteers offer college students and other \nwould-be voters the opportunity to register to vote.  During and in the lead up to federal, state and \nlocal elections, MOVE Texas also conducts get-out-the-vote efforts.  \n  MOVE Texas is forced to divert resources to register people to vote who should \nhave been registered or had their voter registration address updated through DPS’s online driver’s \nlicense system. MOVE Texas must divert resources to educate voters who use the online DPS \nsystem and mistakenly believe they are registered to vote by informing those voters that the DPS \n16 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046   Document 1   Filed 01/14/20   Page 17 of 23\n \n \ntransaction  does  not  register  them  to  vote.  MOVE  Texas  provides  training  which  includes \ncautioning voters about the fact that online voter registration does not exist in Texas and the DPS \nonline driver’s license system does not register customers to vote. MOVE Texas’s get-out-the-vote \nefforts are thwarted when a voter whom they convinced to show up to the polls is denied the chance \nto cast a ballot that counts because they were not registered to vote during their online driver’s \nlicense renewal or change-of-address transactions due to the State’s failure to comply with the \nNVRA. The State’s violations, outlined in this Complaint, frustrate MOVE Texas’s mission. \n  The time and resources that MOVE Texas spends registering voters who were not \nable to register or update their registrations during online transactions with DPS would otherwise \nbe spent on MOVE Texas activities including registering more voters, building leadership in \nunderrepresented youth communities, issues advocacy,  and getting out the vote.  \n  LWVTX’s  mission  includes  empowering  voters,  defending  democracy  and \nenvisioning a democracy where every person has the desire, the right, the knowledge and the \nconfidence to participate.  LWVTX registers eligible individuals to vote across Texas and during \nand in the lead up to federal, state, and local elections, LWVTX also conducts get-out-the-vote \nefforts.  \n  LWVTX is forced to divert resources to register people to vote who should have \nbeen registered or had their voter registration address updated through DPS’s online driver’s \nlicense system. LWVTX must divert resources to educate voters who use the online DPS system \nand mistakenly believe they are registered to vote by informing those voters that the DPS \ntransaction does not register them to vote. LWVTX then must check those voters’ registration \nstatus with the voters and register those voters anew when they are either unregistered or \n17 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046   Document 1   Filed 01/14/20   Page 18 of 23\n \n \nimproperly registered. LWVTX provides public trainings that include cautioning voters about the \nfact that the DPS online driver’s license system does not register customers to vote. \n  The time and resources that LWVTX spends registering voters who were not able \nto register or update their registrations during online transactions with DPS would otherwise be \nspent on LWVTX activities including registering other voters, educating voters on issues and \ncandidates, and getting out the vote.  \n  LWVTX’s get-out-the-vote efforts are thwarted when a voter whom they convinced \nto show up to the polls is denied the chance to cast a ballot that counts because they were not \nproperly  registered  to  vote  by  their  online  driver’s  license  renewal  or  change-of-address \ntransactions due to the State’s failure to comply with the NVRA. The State’s violations, outlined \nin this Complaint, frustrate LWVTX’s mission of empowering voters, defending democracy and \nenvisioning a democracy where every person has the desire, the right, the knowledge and the \nconfidence to participate. \n  LWVTX has members across the state and is harmed when those members seek to \nsimultaneously register to vote or update their voter registration while renewing and/or updating \nthe address on their driver’s license during an online DPS transaction.   \n  Further, LWVTX, as a membership organization, has individual members who are \nharmed by Defendants’ violations because they transact with DPS’s online driver’s license system \nand are not provided a simultaneous voter registration application, nor a simultaneous update to \ntheir voter registration address when they change their driver’s license address through the system. \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \n \nCount I \n \nFailure to Treat Driver’s License Renewal Transactions  \nas Voter Registration Applications  \n18 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046   Document 1   Filed 01/14/20   Page 19 of 23\n \n \n \n  Plaintiffs have a private right of action pursuant to 52 U.S.C. § 20510(b).

Stringer \nv. Whitley, 942 F.3d 715, 725 (5th Cir. 2019). After remand, the Democratic Party \nIntervenors moved to intervene in Stringer I. Dkt. 124. Defendants opposed that \nintervention. Dkt. 133. On January 21, 2020, this Court sua sponte consolidated \nStringer I and Stringer II, Dkt. 135, and granted the Motion to Intervene that the \nDemocratic Party Intervenors filed in Stringer I. Dkt. 136. This Court then dismissed \nthe Stringer I Plaintiffs’ claims from the newly consolidated case. Dkt. 139. \nThe Democratic Party Intervenors allege that Texas “arbitrarily subject[s] \neligible voters to disparate voter registration standards” and has “denied voters an \nequal opportunity to participate in federal and state elections in violation of Section \n1 of the Fourteenth Amendment.” Dkt. 137, ¶ 33. They further allege that, “[a]s a \nresult of this disparate treatment, Intervenor-Plaintiffs were directly harmed in their \nmission to elect Democratic representatives, and those among their membership \nharmed  through  disenfranchisement.”  Id.  The  cause  of  these  alleged  harms, \naccording  to  Plaintiffs,  is  Texas’s  written-signature  requirement  for  voter-\nregistration applications and changes to voter-registration addresses. \nARGUMENT AND AUTHORITY \n  The Democratic Party Intervenors’ complaint should be dismissed for lack of \njurisdiction  because  the  Court  did  not  have  authority  to  grant  the  motion  to \nintervene, and because the Intervenors fail to allege injury-in-fact to themselves or \nto their members. They also lack statutory standing to bring an equal protection \nclaim. Even if they had standing, the Democratic Party Intervenors’ claim fails on the \n2 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 56   Filed 02/11/20   Page 3 of 21\nmerits  because  they  allege  neither  a  discriminatory  intent  nor  effect  on  an \nidentifiable  political  group,  and  because  Texas’s  written-signature  requirement \napplies equally to all voters.  \nI.  The Democratic Party Intervenors should be dismissed under Rule \n12(b)(1) for lack of jurisdiction. \n \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) governs motions to dismiss for lack of \nsubject-matter jurisdiction. E.g., Hooks v. Landmark Indus., Inc., 797 F.3d 309, 312 \n(5th  Cir.  2015)).  “Subject-matter  jurisdiction”  refers  to  “the  courts’  statutory  or \nconstitutional power to adjudicate the case.” Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env’t, \n523 U.S. 83, 89 (1998). Subject-matter jurisdiction is “a threshold issue that must be \nresolved before any federal court reaches the merits of the case before it.” Perez v. \nU.S., 312 F.3d 191, 194 (5th Cir. 2002); Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env’t, 523 \nU.S. at 94-95. \nA. The  Court  lacked  jurisdiction  to  allow  the  Democratic  Party \nIntervenors to intervene in Stringer I. \n \nAs explained in Defendants’ Response in Opposition to the Motion to Intervene, \nDkt. 133,2 once the Court of Appeals declared Stringer I jurisdictionally defective, \nthere  ceased  to  be  an  existing  suit  within  this  Court’s  jurisdiction  in  which  to \nintervene. Instead, Stringer I should have been dismissed and closed by this Court. \nIt is well-settled that “[a]n existing suit within the court’s jurisdiction is a \nprerequisite of an intervention.” Kendrick v. Kendrick, 16 F.2d 744, 745 (5th Cir. \n1926), cert. denied, 273 U.S. 758 (1927) (denying intervention where court did not \n                                            \n2 Defendants re-urge and incorporate by reference Dkt. 133 as if fully set forth herein. \n3 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 56   Filed 02/11/20   Page 4 of 21\nhave jurisdiction over original lawsuit for lack of indispensable parties). Thus, “a \nperson  may  not  intervene  if  the  original,  underlying  case  was  jurisdictionally \ndefective.” Odle v. Flores, 899 F.3d 344, 348 (5th Cir. 2017) (citing Non Commissioned \nOfficers Ass’n v. Army Times Publ’g Co., 637 F.2d 372, 373 (5th Cir. 1981)); see also \nid. (“‘[T]here is no right . . . to intervene in a [jurisdictionally] defective suit.’”) \n(quoting Truvillion v. King’s Daughters Hosp., 614 F.2d 520, 526 (5th Cir. 1980)). \nWhether there is an existing suit within the court’s jurisdiction is assessed \nbased upon “when the motion to intervene was filed.” Krim v. PCOrder.com, 402 F.3d \n489, 502 (5th Cir. 2005); see also id. (“The ‘prerequisite of an intervention’ that there \nbe ‘an existing suit within the Court’s jurisdiction’ depends here on the individual \nclaims. That none of the individual claims remained viable . . . when the motion to \nintervene was filed, disposes of the attempt at intervention.”) (quoting Army Times \nPubl’g Co., 637 F.2d at 373). \nWhen the Court of Appeals issued its mandate on December 5, 2019, there \nceased to be “an existing suit within the Court’s jurisdiction” because—at that point— \n“none of the individual claims” upon which Plaintiffs invoked this Court’s jurisdiction \n“remained  viable.”  E.g.,  Krim,  402  F.3d  at  502;  see  also,  e.g.,  Ericsson  Inc.  v. \nInterDigital Commc’ns Corp., 418 F.3d 1217, 1222 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (rejecting the \nargument that—because  the district court retained jurisdiction to entertain a motion \nfor relief from final judgment under Rule 60(b)—there was “an existing suit within \nthe court’s jurisdiction” for purposes of intervention) (citing Kendrick, 16 F.2d at 745). \n4 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 56   Filed 02/11/20   Page 5 of 21\nThus, this Court lacked jurisdiction to grant the Motion to Intervene—both as \na jurisdictional matter and in accordance with the mandate rule. “Jurisdiction is \npower to declare the law, and when it ceases to exist, the only function remaining to \nthe court is that of announcing the fact and dismissing the cause.” Steel Co. v. Citizens \nfor a Better Env’t, 523 U.S. at 94 (quoting Ex parte McCardle, 74 U.S. 506, 514 (1868)). \n“Compliance with an order to relinquish jurisdiction necessarily precludes the lower \ncourt from taking any further action other than dismissal, for to do so would involve \nretaining jurisdiction.” Stamper v. Baskerville, 724 F.2d 1106, 1108 (4th Cir. 1984). \nAs the Fifth Circuit has explained, “[t]he mandate rule requires a district court on \nremand to effect our mandate and to do nothing else.” Gen. Universal Sys., Inc. v. \nHAL, Inc., 500 F.3d 444, 453 (5th Cir. 2007).  \nThe Democratic Party Intervenors’ claims should be dismissed because this \nCourt lacked jurisdiction to grant the motion to intervene. \nB. The Democratic Party Intervenors lack standing. \n \nEven  if  the  Court  had  jurisdiction  to  grant  the  Motion  to  Intervene,  the \nDemocratic Party Intervenors fail to allege facts which, if true, would establish their \nstanding. “[S]tanding is perhaps the most important of the jurisdictional doctrines.” \nFW/PBS, Inc. v. City of Dallas, 493 U.S. 215, 231 (1990) (internal quotation omitted). \nTo establish Article III standing, a plaintiff must show: (1) an actual or imminent, \nconcrete  and  particularized  “injury-in-fact”;  (2)  that  is  fairly  traceable  to  the \nchallenged action of the defendant (causation); and (3) that is likely to be redressed \nby a favorable decision (redressability). Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Envt’l. \n5 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 56   Filed 02/11/20   Page 6 of 21\nServs.  (TOC),  Inc.,  528  U.S.  167,  180-81  (2000).  All  three  elements  are  “an \nindispensable part of the plaintiff’s case” and each plaintiff bears the burden to \nestablish them. E.g., Lujan v. Defs. of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 561 (1992). \nThe Democratic Party Intervenors lack organizational standing because they \nhave not plead injury-in-fact. They similarly and lack associational standing to sue \non behalf of their members because they have not alleged injury-in-fact to individuals \namong their membership, because they have not identified an interest germane to \ntheir purpose, and because the claim asserted requires the participation of individual \nmembers. Moreover, even if they had Article III standing, the Democratic Party \nIntervenors’ case should still be dismissed because they lack statutory standing. \n1.  Organizational Standing \n \nAn  organization  has  standing  to  sue  if  it  satisfies  the  same  Article  III \nrequirements  of  injury-in-fact,  causation,  and  redressability  applicable  to \nindividuals. NAACP v. City of Kyle, Tex., 626 F.3d 233, 237 (5th Cir. 2010) (citing \nLujan, 504 U.S. at 560-61). “[A]n organization may establish injury in fact by showing \nthat it had diverted significant resources to counteract the defendant’s conduct; \nhence,  the  defendant’s  conduct  significantly  and  ‘perceptibly  impaired’  the \norganization’s ability to” conduct its routine “‘activities—with the consequent drain \non the organization’s resources[.]’” Id. (quoting Havens Realty Corp. v. Coleman, 455 \nU.S. 363, 379 (1982)). “Not every diversion of resources to counteract [a] defendant’s \nconduct, however, establishes an injury in fact.” Id. at 238. Rather, any “[s]uch injury \nmust be ‘concrete and demonstrable.’” Id. \n6 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 56   Filed 02/11/20   Page 7 of 21\nThus, to establish standing, “an organizational plaintiff must explain how the \nactivities it undertakes in response to the defendant’s conduct differ from its ‘routine \n[] activities,’” and must “identify ‘specific projects that [it] had to put on hold or \notherwise curtail in order to respond to’ the defendant’s conduct.” Def. Distributed v. \nUnited States Dep’t of State, No. 1:15-CV-372-RP, 2018 WL 3614221, at *4 (W.D. Tex. \nJuly 27, 2018) (quoting City of Kyle, 626 F.3d at 238). See also, e.g., ACORN v. Fowler, \n178 F.3d 350, 358 (5th Cir. 1999) (holding that organization’s expenditures must be \n“caused by an[] action by” the defendant that the organization “claims is illegal, as \nopposed to part of the normal, day-to-day operations of the group” to confer standing) \n(citing Fair Hous. Council of Suburban Philadelphia v. Montgomery Newspapers, 141 \nF.3d 71, 78 & n.5 (3d Cir. 1998)).3 \nThe Democratic Party Intervenors do not meet this standard. TDP alleges that  \n•  it “is the statewide organization representing Democratic candidates \nand voters throughout the State of Texas within the meaning of Section \n117 of Texas’s Election Code;”4 \n \n•  its “purpose is to elect Democratic Party candidates to public office \nthroughout Texas;” and \n \n•  its  activities  “include[]  supporting  Democratic  Party  candidates  in \nnational, state, and local elections through fundraising and organizing; \nprotecting the legal rights of voters; and ensuring that all voters have a \nmeaningful ability to cast ballots in Texas.” \n \nDkt. 137, ¶11.  \n                                            \n3 See also, e.g., Advocacy Ctr. v. La. Tech Univ., No. CV 18-0934, 2019 WL 1303212, at *4 (W.D. La. \nMar. 6, 2019) (“[A]lthough an organization conceivably could have standing if it incurred [] costs [], the \norganization still must show that it would not have incurred these costs in the absence of defendant’s \nillegal conduct.”), report and recommendation adopted, 2019 WL 1301983 (W.D. La. Mar. 21, 2019) \n(citing Fowler, 178 F.3d at 357-58). \n4 Texas’s Election Code does not contain any “Section 117.” Accord, TEX. ELEC. CODE § 1.001, et seq. \n7 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 56   Filed 02/11/20   Page 8 of 21\nDSCC, for its part, asserts that \n•  it “is the national senatorial committee of the Democratic Party, as \ndefined by 52 U.S.C. § 30101(14);” \n \n•  its mission is “to elect candidates of the Democratic Party to the United \nStates Senate, including in Texas;” \n \n•  its activities include “assisting state parties throughout the country, \nincluding in Texas;” \n \n•  in 2020, it “expects to invest millions in support of the Democratic \ncandidate selected as the nominee to run against Republican Senator \nJohn Cornyn;” \n \n•  “Texas’s conduct directly harms DSCC by frustrating its mission of, and \nefforts in, electing the Democratic Party candidate to the U.S. Senate in \nTexas  by  suppressing  the  access  of  eligible  Texas  citizens  to  the \nfranchise;”  \n \n•  it “is aware of Texas’s online portal system and will have to expend and \ndivert additional funds and resources on ensuring that eligible citizens \nare not misled into believing that they have effectively registered to vote, \nand are in fact registered to vote, as well as to support GOTV, voter \npersuasion efforts, and other activities in Texas, at the expense of its \nother efforts to defeat Senator Cornyn, as well as its efforts in other \nstates, to combat the effects of Texas’s conduct.”5 \n \nDkt.  137,  ¶12.  DCCC  makes  essentially  the  same  allegations  with  respect  to \nCongressional (as opposed to Senatorial) races. Dkt. 137, ¶13. \n  Even if these allegations were true, they do not state that any Democratic \nParty  Intervenor  “diverted  significant  resources  to  counteract  the  defendant’s \nconduct” such that any “defendant’s conduct significantly and ‘perceptibly impaired’ \nthe organization’s ability to” conduct its routine “‘activities—with the consequent \n                                            \n5 It is unclear what is meant by “Texas’s online portal system,” but for purposes of this motion, \nDefendants assume the phrase refers to the process for renewing or changing the address on a Texas \ndriver license online. \n8 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 56   Filed 02/11/20   Page 9 of 21\ndrain on the organization’s resources[.]’” City of Kyle, 626 F.3d at 237 (quoting Havens \nRealty Corp., 455 U.S. at 379). Indeed, TDP does not allege diversion of any resources \nat all to combat Defendants’ allegedly unlawful conduct. Cf. id. \nDSCC’s and DCCC’s cursory allegation of efforts to “combat the effects of \nTexas’s conduct” also fails to establish injury-in-fact. As explained in City of Kyle, \n“[n]ot every diversion of resources to counteract [a] defendant’s conduct [] establishes \nan injury in fact.” 626 F.3d at 238 (quoting Havens Realty Corp., 455 U.S. at 379). \nRather, any “[s]uch injury must be ‘concrete and demonstrable.’” Id. And, plainly, \nDSCC and DCCC do not state that they have “diverted significant resources to \ncounteract  the  [Defendants’]  conduct”  such  that  “the  [Defendants’]  conduct \nsignificantly and ‘perceptibly impaired’ the organization’s ability to” engage in its \n“routine activities,” as required to allege organizational standing. City of Kyle, 626 \nF.3d at 238. \nInstead,  voter  education  and  outreach  are  already  central  to  these \norganizations’  “routine  activities.”  Id.;  Dkt.  137,  ¶¶11-13.  GOTV  and  voter-\nengagement efforts that these entities would engage in regardless of Defendants’ \nallegedly unlawful conduct do not amount to “concrete and demonstrable” injury to \nDSCC or DCCC. Havens Realty Corp., 455 U.S. at 379; City of Kyle, 626 F.3d at 238. \nPut differently, neither DSCC nor DCCC claims  that voter outreach efforts fall \noutside the “normal, day-to-day operations of the group.” Cf. Fowler, 178 F.3d at 358. \nNone of the Democratic Party Intervenors has alleged injury-in-fact as required to \nshow standing. \n9 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 56   Filed 02/11/20   Page 10 of 21\nThe “injury-in-fact” element of standing “serves to distinguish a person with a \ndirect stake in the outcome of a litigation—even though small—from a person with a \nmere interest in the problem.” United States v. Students Challenging Regulatory \nAgency Procedures, 412 U.S. 669, 689 n.14 (1973). Because the Democratic Party \nIntervenors have at most alleged that they are interested in the issues raised in \nStringer I, this Court should dismiss them from this case for failure to allege injury-\nin-fact in their own right. \n2.  Associational Standing \n \nUnder the doctrine of associational standing, an association may have standing \nto bring suit on behalf of its members when: \n[1] its members would otherwise have standing to sue in their own right; \n[2] the interests it seeks to protect are germane to the organization's \npurpose; and [3] neither the claim asserted nor the relief requested \nrequires the participation of individual members in the lawsuit. \n \nNat'l Rifle Ass'n of Am., Inc. v. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, & Explosives, \n700 F.3d 185, 191 (5th Cir. 2012) (quoting Ass’n of Am. Physicians & Surgeons, Inc. \nv. Tex. Med. Bd., 627 F.3d 547, 550 (5th Cir.2010)) (citation omitted). The Democratic \nParty Intervenors do not allege facts to establish any of these factors. \n  As to the first prong, a plaintiff cannot have associational standing unless one \nof its members would have standing to sue individually. See Hunt v. Wash. State \nApple Advert. Comm’n, 432 U.S. 333, 343 (1977); Ctr. for Biological Diversity v. EPA, \n937 F.3d 533, 536 (5th Cir. 2019). Thus, each intervenor must “identify members who \nhave suffered the requisite harm” for injury-in-fact. Summers v. Earth Island Inst., \n555 U.S. 488, 499 (2009); United Food & Comm. Workers Union Loc. 751 v. Brown \n10 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 56   Filed 02/11/20   Page 11 of 21\nGrp., Inc., 517 U.S. 544, 555 (1996) (An “association ‘can establish standing only as \nrepresentatives of those of their members who have been injured in fact, and thus \ncould have brought suit in their own right.’”) (quoting Simon v. E. Ky. Welfare Rights \nOrg., 426 U.S. 26, 40 (1976)). \nDSCC and DCCC do not allege the existence of specific members—let alone \nspecific members who would have standing in their own right. See Dkt. 137. Not \nhaving  members  is  fatal  to  associational  standing.  See  Hunt,  432  U.S.  at  344 \n(requiring “indicia of membership in an organization” for associational standing); City \nof Olmsted Falls v. FAA, 292 F.3d 261, 267–68 (D.C. Cir. 2002). TDP does allege that \nit “has millions of members and constituents from across Texas.” Dkt. 137, ¶11. It \nfurther states that those members “include[] millions of Texans who are registered \nwith the Texas Department of State’s Division of Elections as Democrats, millions of \nTexans who are drivers who interact with DPS, and many other Texans who regularly \nsupport and vote for candidates affiliated with the Democratic Party.” Dkt. 137, ¶11.6 \nBut  TDP’s  failure  to  identify  any  member  with  specificity  is  fatal  to  its \nassociational standing. See, e.g., City of Kyle, 626 F.3d at 237 (requiring evidence of \n“a specific member”); Ga. Republican Party v. SEC, 888 F.3d 1198, 1203 (11th Cir. \n2018); Draper v. Healey, 827 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 2016) (dismissing under Rule 12(b)(1) \nbecause plaintiff did not identify a member affected by the challenged regulation). \nAnd even if TDP had identified a specific member, it did not plead “a continuing \nor threatened future injury” as required to establish standing here. Cf. Stringer v. \n                                            \n6 Texas does not have a “Department of State,” and will presume for purposes of this Motion that TDP \nrefers to the Texas “Secretary of State.” \n11 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 56   Filed 02/11/20   Page 12 of 21\nWhitley, 942 F.3d at 721. As the Fifth Circuit explained in Stringer I, to establish \nstanding, a plaintiff “must demonstrate a sufficient probability that [they] will use” \nthe challenged “driver’s license services again.” Id. at 722. Where “Plaintiffs do not \npoint to any Plaintiff-specific evidence suggesting that they will become unregistered \nand eligible to renew their driver’s licenses using the DPS System,” they “have not \nestablished  a  substantial  risk  that  they  will  attempt  to  update  their  voter \nregistrations using the DPS System and be injured by their inability to do so.” Id. at \n723. “As a result,” such “Plaintiffs have not established an injury in fact sufficient to \nconfer standing to pursue the declaratory and injunctive relief that they seek.” Id. \nTo be sure, Stringer v. Whitley was an appeal from cross-motions for summary \njudgment after the development of a record. But even at the pleading stage, a litigant \nmust at least allege facts which would demonstrate standing if true. E.g., Lujan, 504 \nU.S. at 561. And here, TDP merely alleges having members who “interact with DPS.” \nThus, even if all their factual allegations were proven, they still could not “establish[] \na substantial risk that” any member “will attempt to update their voter registrations \nusing the DPS System and be injured by their inability to do so.” Id. at 723. \nThe  Democratic  Party  Intervenors  also  fail  the  second  prong  of  the \nassociational standing analysis, as they have not identified any interest germane to \ntheir purpose that is to be served by this litigation. While their missions are to elect \nDemocratic candidates, this lawsuit seeks to compel Texas to register voters and \nupdate  existing  registrations  absent  a  written,  signed  request  from  the  voter. \nCompare Dkt. 137 at 10-11 (“Prayer for Relief”) with Dkt. 137 ¶¶11-13. Despite the \n12 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 56   Filed 02/11/20   Page 13 of 21\nfact  that  “[t]he  germaneness  requirement  is  ‘undemanding’  and  requires  ‘mere \npertinence’ between the litigation at issue and the organization’s purpose,” at least \nthat pertinence is still required. Ass’n of Am. Physicians & Surgeons, Inc. v. Tex. Med. \nBd., 627 F.3d at 551 n. 2. The records of all voters (regardless of political affiliation) \nwho move between Texas counties and transact with DPS online is not “pertinent” to \nthe Democratic Party Intervenors’ specific mission to elect Democratic candidates. \nThe  Democratic  Party  Intervenors  also  fail  the  third  prong,  because  the \nparticipation of individual members is required to obtain the relief they request. It is \nnot enough to allege the existence of members eligible to transact with DPS online. \nThey still must bring a claim that is “not particular to any individual” and “thus \nproperly resolved in a group context.” Gulf Restoration Network, Inc. v. Salazar, 683 \nF.3d 158, 168 (5th Cir. 2012). They cannot do so where, as here, individual voter \nregistrations are at the heart of their challenge. Cf., e.g., Church of Scientology v. \nCazares, 638 F.2d 1272, 1276-80 (5th Cir. 1981) (individual participation not required \nwhere  “the  claim  asserted  and  the  relief requested  affect  the  membership  as a \nwhole”); Familias Unidas v. Briscoe, 619 F.2d 391, 398 n. 2 (5th Cir. 1980) (“the \ndeclaratory relief sought, inuring as it would to the benefit of all members, is ideally \nsuited to allowing ‘associational standing.’”) (citation omitted). \n3.  Statutory Standing \n \nEven if the Democratic Party Intervenors had Article III standing, they would \nstill lack statutory standing. See Lexmark Int’l, Inc. v. Static Control Components, \nInc.,  572  U.S.  118, 128  n.4  (2014) (explaining  statutory  standing).  Section 1983 \n13 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 56   Filed 02/11/20   Page 14 of 21\nprovides a cause of action only when the plaintiff suffers “the deprivation of any \nrights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws.” 42 U.S.C. \n§ 1983. It does not provide a cause of action to plaintiffs claiming an injury based on \nthe violation of a third party’s rights. See Coon v. Ledbetter, 780 F.2d 1158, 1160 (5th \nCir.  1986)  (“[L]ike  all  persons  who  claim  a  deprivation  of  constitutional  rights, \n[plaintiffs] were required to prove some violation of their personal rights.”); David P. \nCurrie, Misunderstanding Standing, 1981 Sup. Ct. Rev. 41, 45. \nThus, § 1983 follows the general rule that a plaintiff “must assert [her] own \nlegal rights and interests, and cannot rest [her] claim to relief on the legal rights or \ninterests of third parties.” Danos v. Jones, 652 F.3d 577, 582 (5th Cir. 2011) (quoting \nWarth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 499 (1975)) (alterations original). When “[t]he alleged \nrights at issue” belong to a third party, rather than the plaintiff, the plaintiff lacks \nstatutory standing, regardless of Article III standing. Id.; see also Conn v. Gabbert, \n526 U.S. 286, 292–93 (1999) (holding that lawyer “clearly had no standing” to bring \n§ 1983 claim for injury suffered as a result of “the alleged infringement of the rights \nof his client” because a plaintiff “generally must assert his own legal rights and \ninterests, and cannot rest his claim to relief on the legal rights or interests of third \nparties.”) \nThe Democratic Party Intervenors assert an equal protection claim in the \ncontext of voter registration. But, as artificial entities, the TDP, DCCC, and DSCC do \nnot have voting rights. “It goes without saying that political parties, although the \nprincipal players in the political process, do not have the right to vote.” Vieth v. \n14 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 56   Filed 02/11/20   Page 15 of 21\nPennsylvania, 188 F. Supp. 2d 532, 546 (M.D. Pa. 2002); see also Concerned Home \nCare Providers, Inc. v. Cuomo, 783 F.3d 77, 91 (2d Cir. 2015) (“But Plaintiffs—five \ncorporations and a not-for-profit trade organization—are not entitled to vote and have \nno  right  to  equal  representation  in  the  legislature.”)  The  Democratic  Party \nIntervenors are necessarily asserting the rights of third parties, and lack statutory \nstanding to sue under § 1983. \nII.  The Democratic Party Intervenors should be dismissed under Rule \n12(b)(6) for failure to state a cognizable Equal Protection claim. \n \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) “authorizes a court to dismiss a claim \non the basis of a dispositive issue of law.” Neitzke v. William, 490 U.S. 319, 326 (1989) \n(citations omitted). “This procedure, operating on the assumption that the factual \nallegations  in  the  complaint  are  true,  streamlines  litigation by  dispensing  with \nneedless discovery and factfinding.” Id. at 326-27. Thus, the issue under Rule 12(b)(6) \nis whether the Complaint alleges “enough facts to state a claim to relief that is \nplausible on its face,” assuming that the allegations are true. Bell Atlantic Corp. v. \nTwombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007). Notably, “[t]he tenet that a court must accept as \ntrue  all  of  the  allegations  contained  in  a  complaint  is  inapplicable  to  legal \nconclusions.” Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (citing Bell Atlantic Corp. v. \nTwombly, 550 U.S. at 555).  \nNone of the Democratic Party Intervenors alleges a violation of the NVRA. See \nDkt. 137. Instead, they allege a violation of the Equal Protection Clause. As set forth \nsupra, none has standing to pursue such a claim in its own right or as an association \n15 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 56   Filed 02/11/20   Page 16 of 21\nrepresenting its members. But even if standing could be established, the Democratic \nParty Intervenors’ equal protection claim would fail on the merits. \nA.  Democratic Party Intervenors \n \nTexas’s handling of online transactions with DPS does not violate the Equal \nProtection  Clause  with  respect  to  the  Democratic  Party  Intervenors.  An  equal \nprotection  claim  involving  voting  rights  requires  allegation  of  “intentional \ndiscrimination against an identifiable political group and an actual discriminatory \neffect on that group.” Republican Party of N.C. v. Martin, 980 F.2d 943, 955 (4th Cir. \n1992) (citation omitted); see also, e.g., Veasey v. Abbott, 830 F.3d 216, 230 (5th Cir. \n2016) (en banc) (stating that “[p]roof of racially discriminatory intent or purpose is \nrequired to show a violation of the Equal Protection Clause”) (quoting Village of \nArlington  Heights  v.  Metro.  Hous.  Dev.  Corp.,  429  U.S.  252,  265  (1977)).  The \nDemocratic Party Intervenors have not plausibly alleged intentional or purposeful \ndiscrimination in which one class is favored over another. \nStatutes providing neutral rules, which might benefit any political party, are \nnot rendered discriminatory by the fact that they benefit one party when applied in \nparticular circumstances. See Rodriguez v. Popular Democratic Party, 457 U.S. 1, 10 \nn.10  (1982)  (holding  that  “a  statute  providing  that  all  such  vacancies  [in  the \nlegislature] be filled by appointment does not have a special impact on any discrete \ngroup of voters or candidates” and thus is not discriminatory for equal-protection \npurposes). Here, the Democratic Party Intervenors do not even allege that Texas’s \nhandling  of  online  driver  license  renewal  and  change  of  address  transactions \n16 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 56   Filed 02/11/20   Page 17 of 21\ndisproportionately impacts them. And they certainly do not allege that it is the result \nof “intentional discrimination” against Democrats. Cf. Republican Party of N.C. v. \nMartin, 980 F.2d at 955. \nThe Democratic Party Intervenors fail to state an equal protection claim. \nB.  Individual Voters \n \nConsideration of the equal protection rights of individual voters would require \nassociational standing, which the Democratic Party Intervenors have not alleged. See \nsupra, Part I(B)(2). But even if they had, Texas’s handling of online driver license \nrenewal and change of address transactions does not violate any individual’s right to \nequal protection. This is because Texas’s written-signature requirement for new \nvoter-registration  applications  and  requests  to  update  voter-registration \ninformation—which prevents online voter-registration transactions—applies equally \nto everyone and does not impose an unconstitutional burden on the right to vote. See \nTEX. ELEC. CODE §§ 13.002(b), 15.021(a), (d); see also id. § 20.066(a)(1). \nIn evaluating an alleged burden on voting rights, the Anderson/Burdick test \nrequires the Court to “first consider the character and magnitude of the asserted \ninjury to the rights protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments that the \nplaintiff seeks to vindicate.” Voting for Am., Inc. v. Steen, 732 F.3d 382, 387 (5th Cir. \n2013) (quoting Anderson, 460 U.S. at 789). Then, the Court “must identify and \nevaluate the precise interest put forward by the State as justifications for the burden \nimposed by its rule.” Id. (quoting Anderson, 460 U.S. at 789). Finally, the Court \nweighs the “character and magnitude of the asserted in-jury” against the “precise \n17 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 56   Filed 02/11/20   Page 18 of 21\ninterests put forward by the State,” taking into consideration “the extent to which \nthose interests make it necessary to burden the plaintiff’s rights.” Id. at 387-88 \n(quoting Burdick, 504 U.S. at 434). When a state election law provision imposes only \n“reasonable,  nondiscriminatory  restrictions”  upon  the  First  and  Fourteenth \nAmendment rights of voters, “the state’s important regulatory interests are generally \nsufficient to justify” the restrictions. Anderson, 460 U.S. at 788.  \nAs  to  the  “character  and  magnitude  of  the  asserted  injury  to  the  rights \nprotected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments” at issue, Democratic Party \nIntervenors  assert  that  individuals  who  choose  to  use  DPS’s  online  system  are \nburdened because—unlike individuals who choose to interact with DPS in person or \nby mail—online users cannot simply check a box to become registered to vote or \nchange their registration address. See generally Dkt. 137. Instead, individuals using \nDPS’s online system must print out a voter-registration form, fill it out, sign it, and \nmail it, which satisfies Texas’s written-signature requirement. \nTexans can register to vote in several ways: in person, by mail, or by fax. TEX. \nELEC. CODE § 13.002(a). Texas law also permits voter registration in conjunction with \na driver’s license transaction (either in person or by mail). But because of Texas’s \nwritten signature requirement, id. § 13.002(b), Texas has never permitted online \nvoter registration. \nBeing treated like everyone else—making a written, signed request to register \nto vote or update voter-registration information—does not burden any individual’s \nright to equal protection. If an individual desires the simplicity of checking a single \n18 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 56   Filed 02/11/20   Page 19 of 21\nbox, they may fill out a paper registration form. Stated differently, providing multiple \noptions for individuals to register to vote is not a violation of the Equal Protection \nClause even if the Democratic Party Intervenors consider some options to be less \nconvenient than others. \nThe interests of the State in requiring written signatures, which necessarily \nforecloses  online  registration,  include  maintaining  accurate  voting  rolls  and \ncombatting fraud. It cannot be debated that States have an interest in requiring a \nsignature from voters. See, e.g., 52 U.S.C. § 20504(c). And Texas can use written \nsignatures in cases of fraud, identity theft, and consideration of absentee ballots. See, \ne.g. Husted v. A. Philip Randolph Inst., 138 S. Ct. 1833, 1838 (2018) (“It has been \nestimated that 24 million voter registrations in the United States—about one in \neight—are either invalid or significantly inaccurate.”) (citation omitted). \nThe Fifth Circuit has also recognized that preventing voter-registration fraud \nis a permissible state interest that warrants some limits on voter registration. Voting \nfor Am., 732 F.3d at 394-95. It is not necessary for Defendants to produce specific \nevidence of fraud to justify preventative measures. Id. (citing Crawford v. Marion \nCty. Election Bd., 553 U.S. 181, 196 (2008) (plurality op.)); see Short v. Brown, 893 \nF.3d 671, 679 (9th Cir. 2018) (finding “general interest in increasing voter turnout” \nsufficient to justify experimental use of mail-in ballots in specific counties); Tripp v. \nScholz, 872 F.3d 857, 866 (7th Cir. 2017) (finding “speculative concern” sufficient to \njustify ballot-access limitation); Ohio Democratic Party v. Husted, 834 F.3d 620, 632 \n(6th Cir. 2016) (holding that when a regulation is “not unduly burdensome,” a State \n19 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 56   Filed 02/11/20   Page 20 of 21\ndoes not have to “prove” that evidence supports its interest; the court may defer to \nthe legislature’s findings); cf. Husted, 138 S. Ct. at 1847 (cautioning that compliance \nwith the NVRA did not require the State to make “a wise policy judgment” or “have \nsome particular quantum of evidence of a change of residence” before taking steps to \nverify a voter’s address); Munro v. Socialist Workers Party, 479 U.S. 189, 195 (1986) \n(“Legislatures . . . should be permitted to respond to potential deficiencies in the \nelectoral process with foresight rather than reactively . . . .”). \nA State may act to prevent potential fraud, as “[a]ny corruption in voter \nregistration affects a state’s paramount obligation to ensure the integrity of the \nvoting process and threatens the public’s right to democratic government.” Voting for \nAm., 732 F.3d at 394. Balancing individual voter equal-protection rights against the \nState’s interests reveals no unconstitutional burden on the right to vote. The State \nhas provided several options to register to vote, all of which satisfy the State’s \nwritten-signature  requirement.  Whether  to  permit  online  registration  is  a \nquintessentially state-law function, absent a preemptive federal law requiring it. U.S. \nCONST. art. I, § 4, cl. 1. No such law exists. The Equal Protection Clause does not \nrequire what the Democratic Party Intervenors demand, and no individual’s right to \nvote is unconstitutionally burdened by Texas’s written-signature requirement for \nvoter registration. \n \n \n \n20 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 56   Filed 02/11/20   Page 21 of 21\nCONCLUSION & PRAYER \n  The Democratic Party Intervenors’ complaint should be dismissed for lack of \njurisdiction and for failure to state a claim on which relief may be granted. \nRespectfully submitted, \n \nKEN PAXTON \nAttorney General of Texas \n \nJEFFREY C.

HUGHS, et al.,        § \nDefendants.          §   \n \n \nDEFENDANTS’ REPLY IN SUPPORT OF MOTION TO DISMISS \n \n \n  The Democratic Party Intervenors1 do not have standing to assert their claims and their \nparticipation adds nothing to this litigation. They are partisan political organizations whose sole \npurpose is to see their candidates elected, and they are attempting to use this Court as a platform \nto achieve a policy outcome, not vindicate a legal right. The Intervenors cannot show any concrete \nand particularized injury that stems from Defendants’ conduct, nor have they presented evidence \nthat any of their members have been aggrieved. Article III Courts are not a forum for the airing of \ngeneralized grievances. Accordingly, because the Democratic Party Intervenors lack standing and \nhave failed to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, the Court should grant Defendants’ \nmotion to dismiss. See ECF No. 56 (“Mot.”). \nI.  The Evidence \nA.  The Texas Democratic Party (“TDP”) \nTDP is a partisan political organization whose singular mission is to elect Democrats to \npublic office—not to register Texas voters who interacted with DPS online. See TDP Depo. at \n \n1 “Democratic Party Intervenors” or “Intervenors” means the Texas Democratic Party (“TDP”), \nthe Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (“DCCC”), and the Democratic Senatorial \nCampaign Committee (“DSCC”), collectively. \n1 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 73   Filed 05/21/20   Page 2 of 11\n \n22:1-13 (attached hereto as Exhibit A). Although TDP purports to conduct voter registration \nefforts, it is impossible for TDP to determine what it has spent on these efforts, what it takes to \nregister a new voter, or what activities TDP would be engaging in but-for the complained-of \nconduct. See id. at 45:14-21, 101:1-4. Any funds that it receives are spent at its sole discretion, and \nnothing that is given by a donor can be earmarked for any particular purpose (voter registration or \notherwise). See id. at 59:21-60:3. None of TDP’s voter registration outreach efforts are targeted \ntoward individuals who may have transacted online with DPS; instead, TDP targets voters that \nTDP thinks—based on sophisticated data analytics—will vote for Democrats. See id. at 57:2-11, \n64:6-18. In fact, TDP has no idea whether it has registered even a single person who transacted \nwith DPS online. See id. at 101:18-22. And TDP produced no evidence regarding whether any of \nits members are eligible and intend to interact with DPS online to change their address or renew \ntheir driver license. See id. at 108:21-109:6. \nB.  DCCC \nDCCC is a national organization whose purpose is to elect Democrats to the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives. See DCCC Depo. at 6:19-24, 42:16-43:2 (attached hereto as Exhibit B). DCCC \ncannot specify how much of its political expenditures are used for voter registration efforts during \npast election cycles. See id. at 77:10-18, 78:23-79:20. Although DCCC speculated that some of \nthe expenditures it made this election cycle might have been used for activities related to voter \nregistration, the record shows that those funds were given to TDP and to a vendor to provide \nconsulting and training services. See id. at  81:5-14, 82:10-22. DCCC does not  know what \npercentage of its staff’s time is spent on voter registration efforts, which are commingled with \nother organizational objectives targeted to elect democratic congressional candidates, such as voter \npersuasion. See id. at 84:8-10, 85:22-86:23. Nor does DCCC know how much it costs to register a \n2 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 73   Filed 05/21/20   Page 3 of 11\n \nnew voter. See id. at 88:8-24. DCCC’s sole target group for its voter registration efforts are \npotential Democratic voters. See id. at 89:4-16. DCCC does not even track the number of people \nit interacts with who transact with DPS online, and it cannot identify any such voters. See id. at \n98:2-8, 101:17-21. DCCC considers its members to be the Democratic members of the U.S. House \nof Representatives, see id. at 108:2-109:5, and it has produced no evidence regarding whether any \nof them are eligible and intend to interact with DPS online to change their address or renew their \ndriver license. \nC.  DSCC \nDSCC’s sole mission is to elect Democratic candidates to the U.S. Senate. See DSCC \nDepo. at 21:6-14 (attached hereto as Exhibit C). DSCC accomplishes this mission by, among other \nthings, transferring funds to state-level democratic party organizations, who may use that money \nhowever they wish. Id. at 30:2-13. DSCC did not transfer any funds to TDP in past election cycles. \nId. at 39:23-40:8. And it provided no evidence that any funds invested in Texas in past election \ncycles were used for voter registration efforts. See id. at 39:23-40:8, 41:8-12. DSCC has made \nthree investments in Texas this election cycle, but there is no evidence that any of those funds were \nused for voter registration efforts. See id. at 39:13-21. Instead, DSCC supported polling efforts \nunrelated to voter registration, id. at 38:24-39:3, and contributed the maximum amount to the MJ \nHegar campaign, to be used at the campaign’s discretion, id. 30:17-31:3. It did not contribute \nanything to TDP until after filing this lawsuit, id. at Ex. 5, and it cannot show that any of those \nfunds were used to register voters (let alone how much), id. at 30:2-13. Moreover, DSCC produced \nno evidence regarding whether it has any members at all, and certainly has not identified any \nmembers who are eligible and intend to interact with DPS online to change their address or renew \ntheir driver license. \n3 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 73   Filed 05/21/20   Page 4 of 11\n \nII.  The Democratic Party Intervenors Cannot Demonstrate Standing \nNothing that the Democratic Party Intervenors produced during discovery was sufficient \nto demonstrate that they have standing to bring their claims. Defendants continue to maintain their \nchallenge to all aspects of the Intervenors’ assertion of standing, on which Intervenors bear the \nburden of proof at all stages of the litigation. But the Intervenors’ evidence with respect to \norganizational and associational standing is particularly lacking, as described below, and this alone \nprovides ample basis for the Court to dismiss their claims. \n  A.  Organizational Standing \nAs explained in Defendants’ motion to dismiss, the Democratic Party Intervenors failed to \nallege facts sufficient to constitute an injury-in-fact. See Mot. at 6-10. After discovery, it is clear \nthat they cannot demonstrate any legally cognizable injury. Accordingly, the Democratic Party \nIntervenors lack standing to proceed in their own right. \nThe Democratic Party Intervenors are required to prove to this Court that they have \nsuffered a “concrete and demonstrable injury to the organization’s activities—with the consequent \ndrain on the organization’s resources [that] constitutes far more than simply a setback to the \norganization’s abstract social interests.” Havens Realty Corp. v. Coleman, 455 U.S. 363, 379 \n(1982).  “Not  every  diversion  of  resources  to  counteract  [a]  defendant’s  conduct,  however, \nestablishes an injury in fact.” NAACP v. City of Kyle, 626 F.3d 233, 238 (5th Cir. 2010). The \nalleged injury must be in some way “different from the plaintiffs’ daily operations.” OCA-Greater \nHous. v. Texas, 867 F.3d 604, 612 (5th Cir. 2017) (citing City of Kyle, 626 F.3d 233); see also \nCommon Cause/Ga. v. Billups, 554 F.3d 1350 (11th Cir. 2009) (holding that an organization can \nshow standing if it demonstrates that it “will divert resources from its regular activities” to \ncounteract defendants’ allegedly illegal conduct). And, importantly, a plaintiff must have standing \n4 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 73   Filed 05/21/20   Page 5 of 11\n \nnot only throughout the life of the litigation, but at they time they filed suit. See, e.g., Pluet v. \nFrasier, 355 F.3d 381, 386 (5th Cir. 2004); Soc’y of Separationists, Inc. v. Herman, 959 F.2d 1283, \n1288 (5th Cir. 1992).2 \nCourts are “not responsible for vindicating generalized partisan preferences.”  Gill v. \nWhitford, 138 S. Ct. 1916, 1933 (2018). “Frustration of an organization’s objectives is the type of \nabstract concern that does not impart standing.” Ctr. for Law & Educ. v. Dep’t of Educ., 396 F.3d \n1152, 1161-62 (D.C. Cir. 2005) (quotation omitted). Mere “hope of achieving a Democratic \nmajority in the legislature . . . is a collective political interest, not an individual legal interest,” and \ndoes not constitute an injury-in-fact for standing purposes. Gill, 138 S. Ct. at 1932. “Harm to an \norganization’s generalized partisan preferences describes only ‘a setback to [its] abstract social \ninterests,’ which is insufficient to establish a concrete injury in fact.” Jacobson v. Fla. Sec’y of \nState, No. 19-14552, 957 F.3d 1193, at *8 (11th Cir. Apr. 29, 2020) (quoting Havens Realty, 455 \nU.S. at 379). “An organization’s general interest in its preferred candidates winning as many \nelections as possible is still a ‘generalized partisan preference[]’ that federal courts are “not \nresponsible for vindicating[.]’” Id. (quoting Gill, 138 S. Ct. at 1933). Each of the Democratic Party \nIntervenors is clear that their sole mission is to elect Democratic candidates, as discussed above. \nAccordingly, the sole interest they seek to vindicate constitutes a mere “generalized partisan \npreference” that cannot form the basis of an injury-in-fact for standing purposes. \nMoreover, the Democratic Party Intervenors must show an explicit connection between the \nchallenged practice and the alleged injury. For example, in ACORN v. Fowler, 178 F.3d 350 (5th \n \n2 See also, e.g., Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Envtl. Servs., 528 U.S. 167, 191 (2000) \n(recognizing that, unlike mootness, “[s]tanding admits of no similar exception; if a plaintiff lacks \nstanding at the time the action commences, the fact that the dispute is capable of repetition yet \n \nevading review will not entitle the complainant to a federal judicial forum”)\n5 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 73   Filed 05/21/20   Page 6 of 11\n \nCir.  1999),  the  plaintiff  organization  brought  three  claims  challenging  Louisiana’s  voter \nregistration practices on the theory that they violated the NVRA. ACORN demonstrated that it \n“engages in voter registration drives in Louisiana, that it provides voter registration applications \nto unregistered potential members, and that it makes voter registration applications available at \nhousing fairs that it attends throughout the year.” Id. at 359. ACORN also demonstrated that it \n“hired staff” to conduct voter registration training, “coordinated voter registration drives,” and \nsupervised  staff,  among  other  similar  activities.  Id.  And  ACORN  claimed  “that  its  efforts \nregistering voters in Louisiana counteract the appellees’ failure to properly implement the NVRA.” \nId. at 360. \nThe Fifth Circuit found that with respect its first two claims, ACORN had not demonstrated \nan injury. The court discounted much of ACORN’s evidence regarding its staff hiring and \nsupervision because ACORN did not show that these activities were “a direct result of Louisiana’s \nalleged failure to properly implement the NVRA.” Id. at 360. The court also doubted “ACORN’s \nallegations  of  injury  due  to  including  voter  registration  applications  with  its  membership \napplications or ‘set[ting] up’ a voter registration table at housing fairs that it already attends,” and \nfound that such activities did not constitute a perceptible impairment caused by the “purported \nfailure to implement the NVRA.” Id. (citing Havens Realty, 455 U.S. at 379). None of these \nactivities were shown to have the requisite connection to the challenged activity that is necessary \nto demonstrate organizational standing. See id. \nACORN was found to have raised a genuine issue of material fact regarding its third claim \nbecause it “concentrated” one voter registration drive to specifically target “a population directly \naffected  by  one  of  the  NVRA  requirements  that  ACORN  claims  Louisiana  has  failed  to \nimplement.” Id. at 361. The court found that ACORN was injured by having to conduct this highly \n6 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 73   Filed 05/21/20   Page 7 of 11\n \ntargeted voter registration effort because those resources were expended to register voters in a way \nthat specifically “counteract[ed] Louisiana’s alleged failure to implement the [NVRA].” Id. This \nwas the only injury that the court found to be “concrete and demonstrable.” Id. at 362. But with \nrespect to all of ACORN’s other voter registration efforts, “[t]here is simply no suggestion in the \nrecord that anyone it has registered through its voter registration drives would already have been \nregistered to vote if Louisiana implemented the NVRA requirements that form the basis of its first \ntwo claims.” Id. \nThe Democratic Party Intervenors’ evidence does not demonstrate that any of their voter \nregistration activities are conducted specifically to counteract Defendants’ alleged practices. \nUnlike ACORN’s evidence regarding its third claim, which suggested that it may have been \ninjured to the limited extent that some of its efforts were “concentrated” to reach a specific group, \nsee id. at 361, the Democratic Party Intervenors do not target voter registration activities directed \nat  individuals  who  transacted  with  DPS  online.  Instead,  as  discussed  above,  the  evidence \ndemonstrates that any voter registration efforts they undertake are carefully calculated to reach \nvoters likely to vote for Democrats. Accordingly, their efforts are not specifically connected to the \nchallenged practices. \nTo the extent any Intervenor has evidence that it engages in voter registration efforts in \nTexas, those are activities that they would have engaged in regardless of Defendants’ alleged \nconduct, and the Intervenors have not shown that any of their activities are “a direct result of \n[Texas’s] alleged failure to properly implement the NVRA.” Id. at 360 (emphasis added). None of \nthe materials that they produced in discovery discuss any particular efforts directed at those who \ntransacted online with DPS. Indeed, none of the Democratic Party Intervenors can offer proof \nshowing how many individuals—if any at all—“would already have been registered to vote if \n7 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 73   Filed 05/21/20   Page 8 of 11\n \n[Texas] implemented the NVRA requirements that form the basis of its . . . claims.” Id. at 362; see \nsupra, Part I. \nThe Democratic Party Intervenors essentially argue that because they engage in some voter \nregistration efforts, they have standing to challenge any voter registration practice with which they \ndisagree or which does not align with their preferred policy. But this is not the law. The Democratic \nParty Intervenors must show a “concrete and demonstrable” injury, Havens Realty, 455 U.S. at \n379, yet they cannot identify even one dollar that was spent or one voter that was registered as a \nresult of their efforts to counteract this particular practice. None of their purported activities \nconstitute anything other their routine “daily operations.” OCA-Greater Hous., 867 F.3d at 612. \nAccordingly, the Democratic Party Intervenors have not shown that they have suffered a concrete \nand demonstrable injury as a result of Defendants’ practices, and they do not have standing to \nbring their claims. \n  B.  Associational Standing \nTo the extent that the Democratic Party Intervenors claim standing to vindicate their \nmembers’ injuries, they also fail. “‘Standing,’ [the Supreme Court has] said, ‘is not ‘an ingenious \nacademic exercise in the conceivable’ . . . [but] requires . . . a factual showing of perceptible \nharm.’” Summers v. Earth Island Inst., 555 U.S. 488, 499 (quoting Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, \n504 U.S. 555, 566 (1992)). The Supreme Court “has required plaintiffs claiming an organizational \nstanding to identify members who have suffered the requisite harm.” Id. at 499. The Democratic \nParty Intervenors have not identified any such member or demonstrated facts that show how even \none  of  their  members  has  been  aggrieved  by  the  Defendants’  conduct.  Accordingly,  the \nDemocratic Party Intervenors do not have standing. \n8 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 73   Filed 05/21/20   Page 9 of 11\n \nThe Democratic Party Intervenors rely on Hancock County Board of Supervisors v. Ruhr, \n487 F. App’x 189 (5th Cir. 2012), for the proposition that they do not need to identify a specific \naggrieved member. See ECF No. 71 at 12 (“Opp.”). But whatever the relevance of Hancock—\nneither it nor the Intervenors cite or discuss the clear pronouncement in Summers on the issue—\nthe lessened pleading standard that it describes is both irrelevant in this case because the parties \nhave  now  conducted  discovery,  and  legally  untenable  because  the  Supreme  Court  recently \nreaffirmed that “the essential elements of a claim remain constant through the life of a lawsuit.” \nComcast Corp. v. Nat’l Ass’n of African American-Owned Media, 140 S. Ct. 1009, 1014 (2020). \nThe Democratic Party Intervenors’ failure to demonstrate with evidence that any of its members \nwould have standing is therefore fatal to their assertion of associational standing. \nThe Democratic Party Intervenors alternatively rely on the expansive argument that any \nvoter who casts a ballot for a Democrat is one of their members for standing purposes. See Opp. \nat 11. Even if Intervenors were not required to allege and demonstrate a formal membership \nstructure, they must show that their constituents “possess all of the indicia of membership in an \norganization,” such as electing the organization’s members, serving in the organization, and \nfinancing its activities. Hunt v. Wash. State Apple Advertising Comm’n, 432 U.S. 333, 344-45 \n(1977). The evidence here falls well short of this standard. And in any event, Intervenors have \nfailed to demonstrate that any one of their members would have standing in their own right, even \nunder this expansive definition. Accordingly, any assertion of associational standing fails. \nIII.  Collateral Estoppel is Inapplicable \nDefendants  have  explained  in  their  motion  to  dismiss  why  the  Democratic  Party \nIntervenors’  equal  protection  claim  is  without  merit,  and  their  opposition  adds  nothing  of \nsubstance. See Opp. at 20. Instead, the Intervenors rely solely on the Court’s prior rulings in \n9 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 73   Filed 05/21/20   Page 10 of 11\n \nStringer I—a case which did not involve them—and assert that collateral estoppel precludes \nDefendants  from  even  mounting  a  defense.  See  Opp.  at  16-19.  But  the  Democratic  Party \nIntervenors egregiously misconstrue the doctrine of collateral estoppel, also known as issue \npreclusion, which has no application to this litigation whatsoever. \n“[A] civil judgment generates issue preclusion only when it’s ‘valid and final.’” Langley \nv. Price, 926 F.3d 145, 164 (5th Cir. 2019) (quoting Restatement (Second) of Judgments § 27 (Am. \nLaw Inst. 1982)). “[O]nce a civil judgment is reversed on appeal, it’s obviously no longer ‘valid’ \nand retains zero preclusive effect.” Id. The Fifth Circuit reversed and vacated the judgment in \nStringer I in its entirety due to the plaintiffs’ lack of standing; no part of that order survived. See \nStringer v. Whitley (Stringer I), 942 F.3d 715 (5th Cir. 2019). Accordingly, that prior judgment \n“retains zero preclusive effect.” Langley, 926 F.3d at 164. The Democratic Party Intervenors waste \nthis Court’s time in suggesting otherwise. \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court should grant Defendants’ motion to dismiss. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n10 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 73   Filed 05/21/20   Page 11 of 11\n \nRespectfully submitted. \n \nKEN PAXTON \nAttorney General of Texas \n \nJEFFREY C.

Rather, the State’s substantive arguments relate \nonly to the Plaintiffs’ standing—apparently arguing that if the plaintiffs in Stringer I lacked \nstanding, that no plaintiffs will ever have standing to challenge their unlawful practices. However, \nthe evidence already presented to this Court clearly demonstrates that the individual Plaintiffs in \n1 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 75   Filed 05/24/20   Page 2 of 9\nthis  case  meet  the  standing  requirements  set  out  in  Stringer  I,  and  the  organizational  and \nassociational plaintiffs also have standing independent of the individual Plaintiffs.  \n1.  Individual Plaintiffs \nDefendants continue to ignore that “[t]he existence of federal jurisdiction ordinarily \ndepends on the facts as they exist when the complaint is filed.” See Plaintiffs’ Resp. to MTD, Doc. \n64 (Mar. 30, 2020) at 9 (quoting Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 569 n.4 (emphasis \nin original)). Individual Plaintiffs in this case were not registered to vote due to Defendants’ NVRA \nviolations at the time they instituted this suit, making their injuries on-going and “continuing \ninjuries” at the time of filing. See id.  Plaintiff Stringer’s concrete future plans to move again also \nsuffice to establish the likelihood of future injury sufficient to confer standing. See Plaintiffs’ \nSupplemental Brief, Doc. 69 at n.25-27 and accompanying text (May 13, 2020); App’x, Doc. 69-\n1 at 72-74 (May 13, 2020). Texas law expressly allows an individual’s spouse to register them to \nvote, so it is of no consequence that Stringer’s wife may be the one transacting on his behalf with \nDPS  online  upon  their  future  move.  See  TEX.  ELEC.  CODE  §  13.003.  Further,  contrary  to \nDefendants’ claim, Plaintiff Stringer did affirm a concrete intention to simultaneously update both \nhis driver’s license and voter registration online upon moving in August, if Defendants permit him \nto do so. Plaintiffs’ Supplemental Brief, Doc. 69 at n.27 (May 13, 2020); App’x, Doc. 69-1 at 73-\n74 (May 13, 2020). \n2.  Organizational Plaintiffs \nDefendants make much of the fact that Plaintiffs LWVTX and MOVE do not keep separate \nbudgetary accounting for how much they spend specifically on registering voters who were harmed \nby Defendants’ violations. But this fundamentally misunderstands the well-established principle \nthat “the injury in fact requirement under Article III is qualitative, not quantitative, in nature.” \nOCA-Greater Houston v. Texas, 867 F.3d 604, 612 (5th Cir. 2017) (citing Ass’n of Cmty. \n2 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 75   Filed 05/24/20   Page 3 of 9\nOrganizations for Reform Now v. Fowler, 178 F.3d 305, 357–58) (5th Cir. 1999)) (internal \nquotation marks and brackets omitted); see Plaintiffs Response to Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss \nat 12 (Mar. 30, 2020). So, while an injury-in-fact must be (a) concrete and particularized and (b) \nactual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical, “it need not measure more than an ‘identifiable \ntrifle.’” OCA-Greater Houston, 867 F.3d at 612 (quoting Fowler, 178 F.3d at 358).  \nRegardless, Plaintiffs have identified far more than a trifle of an injury. Defendants’ \nSupplemental Brief entirely elides the significant evidence that Plaintiffs previously produced of \ndirect resource diversion caused by Defendants’ violations, which includes, inter alia, specifically \neducating members of the public about the problem with online driver’s license transactions during \npublic presentations, and members and staff routinely expending resources registering voters who \nwere unable to register to vote when transacting with DPS online. See Response to Defendants’ \nMotion to Dismiss, Doc. 64 at 11-18 (Mar. 30, 2020) (citing App’x to Plaintiffs’ Emergency App. \nfor Preliminary Injunction and Request for Hearing, Doc. 5-1 at 161-176 and 187-198 (Jan. 17, \n2020)). It is indisputable that if Plaintiffs’ members and staff did not have to divert resources \neducating the public and registering or re-registering individuals who transacted with DPS online, \nthey would allocate those resources to their other core activities, including, but not limited to, \nregistering even greater numbers of unregistered voters. See id. \n3.  Associational Plaintiffs \nDefendants continue to claim that Plaintiff LWVTX has not and cannot produce evidence \nof an individual member who is harmed by Defendants’ conduct. But LWVTX already has \nidentified a member who had standing at the time the suit was initiated, and evidence of this \nspecific member’s membership status was also the subject of documents produced and deposition \ntestimony elicited by Defendants. See App’x to Plaintiffs’ Reply to Defendants’ Opposition, Doc. \n44-1 at 160-61 (Jan. 28, 2020) (identifying an individual member by name); see also Plaintiffs’ \n3 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 75   Filed 05/24/20   Page 4 of 9\nSupplemental Brief, Doc. 69 at n.40 and accompanying text (May 13, 2020). \nIrreparable Harm \n“An irreparable injury is one that cannot be undone by monetary damages.” Heil Trailer \nInt'l Co. v. Kula, 542 F. App'x 329, 335 (5th Cir. 2013) (citing DFW Metro Line Servs. v. Sw. Bell, \n901 F.2d 1267, 1269 (5th Cir.1990)). Plaintiffs—in particular LWVTX, MOVE, and Stringer—\nhave no adequate remedy at law to remedy their injuries caused by Defendants’ ongoing and future \nviolations, and, by the terms of the NVRA itself, Plaintiffs’ only recourse is injunctive and \ndeclaratory relief. The fact that Plaintiffs have been suffering these injuries daily for many years \nand months while litigation plays out does not undercut the irreparability or severity of their \ninjuries. \nPlaintiffs have previously documented the irreparable harm they suffer. With regard to the \nnew evidence from expedited discovery, Defendants contend that MOVE does not need to spend \nmoney mailing voter registration applications because SOS allows applicants to request their own \npre-paid voter registration applications online. Defendants’ Supplemental Brief, Doc. 74 at 9-10 \n(May 23, 2020). This misses the point. First, MOVE would need to contact the individuals just to \ninform them of the existence of the Secretary of State’s website. Second, if the unregistered \nindividuals were already engaging with the SOS’s website, they would not be unregistered in the \nfirst place, and hence MOVE would not need to contact them about registering. The fact of the \nmatter is, MOVE mails voter registration applications to eligible but unregistered, or improperly \nregistered, individuals to make it easy and convenient for them to register, and this universe of \nunregistered voters would be substantially smaller if individuals were properly able to apply to \nregister simultaneously when transacting with DPS online. See Plaintiffs’ Supplemental Brief, \nDoc. 69 at n.31-32 and accompanying text (May 13, 2020); App’x, Doc. 69-1 at 81-82, 92-93 \n(May 13, 2020). \n4 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 75   Filed 05/24/20   Page 5 of 9\nDefendants’ laches-type argument—that Plaintiffs should be denied equitable relief due to \ndelay in bringing suit and the subsequent “four months since,” Defendants’ Supplemental Brief, \nDoc. 74 at 10—fails to acknowledge that its Defendants’ refusal to comply with the NVRA that \nhas caused this delay. There has been ongoing litigation on this issue since 2016. Early this year, \nwithin a matter of weeks after the Fifth Circuit issued its reversal of this Court’s previous \njudgment, Plaintiffs, including previous Plaintiff Stringer, initiated legal proceedings. Plaintiffs \nrequested immediate relief in Stringer II, and Defendants objected to the quick timeline that was \nproposed for a full fix. Defendants now attempt to have it both ways: they vigorously dispute in \nprotracted litigation that any individuals or organizations have standing to remedy their legal \nviolations and complain that any proposed remedy is burdensome and time-consuming, while in \nthe same breath attempting to blame Plaintiffs for not being quick enough in requesting their relief.  \nIn any event, Plaintiffs have diligently and urgently pursued the relief they seek. They \nproceeded on an extremely expedited discovery schedule, which was only slightly extended by \nunprecedented COVID-related delays, and filed their advisory to the Court within a week of the \nclose of depositions.  \nBurden on the State/Public Interest \n  Given they cannot continue to rely on the administrative and technical burdens previously \nasserted, Defendants’ sole identified burden at this point is that its alleged interest in enforcing its \nown laws. Defendants’ Supplemental Brief, Doc. 74 at 11-12 (May 23, 2020). This argument takes \nfor  granted  that  they  will  succeed  on  the  underlying  merits  of  the  legal  issue—a  dubious \nproposition as this Court has previously noted.  \nAdditionally, Defendants contend that preliminary relief would be improper here because \n“[t]he Supreme Court ‘has repeatedly emphasized that lower federal courts should ordinarily not \nalter the election rules on the eve of an election.’” Id. at 10-11 (quoting Republican Nat’l Comm. \n5 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 75   Filed 05/24/20   Page 6 of 9\nv. Democratic Nat’l Comm., 140 S. Ct. 1205, 1207 (2020)).  First, this rule should not be applied \nhere because it is concerned with election administration procedures that would result in confusion \nat the polls or in some other way “change the rules of the game.” See Republican Nat’l Comm., \n140 S. Ct. at 1207 (considering the legal deadline for sending and receiving mail ballots). Simply \nallowing more voters to register in accordance with their federal rights does not “change the rules” \nsufficient to invoke this rule, and any Texas voter registered in accordance with the NVRA still \nhas to comply with the rule that they apply to be registered 30 days before an election—no \nsignificant changes to the actual administration of an election are involved in any way.  Second, \nDefendants fail to explain how DPS updating its website to be less misleading will possibly result \nin confusion on the part of voters. To the contrary, such updates will lead to less confusion at the \npolls because individuals will not mistakenly believe they have registered to vote through DPS \nonline. See App’x to Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction, Doc. 5-1 at Ex. D (Jan. 17, \n2020). Third, in Republican Nat’l Comm, the Supreme Court stayed a district court order entered \nfive days before an election that required immediate compliance by state election officials. 140 S. \nCt. at 1206-1207.  Here, Plaintiffs request compliance by June 4th, 40 days before the July 14th \nPrimary Runoff Election and 153 days before the November 3rd Presidential Election.   \nFeasibility of Requested Relief \nFinally,  Defendants’  contend  that  Plaintiffs’  requested  relief  “continues  to  be  problematic” \nDefendants’ Supplemental Brief, Doc. 74 at 12 (May 23, 2020). But Plaintiffs request only three \neminently reasonable actions, specifically that the Court order:  \n  DPS to update the front end of the website within the time frame they themselves stated was \npossible (“one to two weeks”). See Plaintiffs’ Supplemental Brief, Doc. 69 at n.13 and \naccompanying text. \n \n  DPS to send the information from the voters who interact with the website from that date \ngoing forward to SOS. DPS is already prepared to do so, and, indeed, was scheduled to have \nbegun doing so on May 17, 2020. See id. at 4-7. Defendants do not indicate DPS failed to meet \n6 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-00046-OLG   Document 75   Filed 05/24/20   Page 7 of 9\nthis goal.  \n \n  SOS to ensure that the eligible individuals who apply to register to vote through DPS online \nbetween the time DPS makes its front-end changes and June 15 are registered with correct \neffective registration dates in time for the July 14 runoff, and that going forward SOS \ncontinues to ensure that other voter registration applications through DPS online be processed \nas required by law. This is SOS’s legal duty, and, even if it does not directly register \nindividuals to vote, it has the authority to compel county voter registrars to do so, and, as a \npractical matter has already demonstrated its ability to ensure registration in this very case. \nSee Defendants’ Advisory, Doc. 48 (Feb. 14, 2020). \n \nPlaintiffs maintain that these requests are reasonable considering the ongoing violations, and have \nattempted in good faith to identify a practicable timeline and implementation plan, and trust in the \nwisdom of this Court to enforce any order in a just way that balances holding Defendants \naccountable while allowing for the possibility of legitimate, insurmountable problems that might \nprevent Defendants from—in good faith—complying with court-ordered timelines. \n \nDated: May 24, 2020.

Cascos, in his official capacity as Texas Secretary of State, and Steven C. \nMcCraw,  in  his  official  capacity  as  Director  of  the  Texas  Department  of  Public  Safety, \n(“Defendants”), file this reply in support of their motion to dismiss under Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6) (ECF 7) (“MTD”). Defendants incorporate the arguments raised \nin that motion, and reply to Plaintiffs’ response to that motion (ECF 9) (“Response”) as follows: \nI.  Plaintiffs’ attempts to establish standing are unavailing. \nAs set forth in Defendants’ motion to dismiss, Plaintiffs lack standing to bring this case \nalleging violations of the National Voter Registration Act (“NVRA”).1 This is because (1) they \ncan establish neither causation nor redressability; (2) their claims are moot; and (3) they have not \nprovided the notice the NVRA requires. MTD at 6-13. Plaintiffs’ Response cannot cure these \njurisdictional defects. \n                                                 \n1 Codified at 52 U.S.C. §§ 20501-20511. \n1 \n \n\na.  Defendants’ causation argument would abrogate the requirement that \nindividuals  wishing  to  register  to  vote  comply  with  valid  State  voter \nregistration law—which the NVRA expressly incorporates. \n \nIt is Plaintiffs’ failure to submit a signed change of address form, rather than any conduct \nby Defendants, that caused the alleged injury in this case. MTD at 7-9. Plaintiffs downplay their \nfailure to show causation because “Defendants do not argue that Plaintiffs failed to exhaust any \nprocedures required by the NVRA. Instead, Defendants maintain that Plaintiffs failed to follow \ninstructions provided by DPS.” Response at 8 (emphasis original). Plaintiffs claim that their failure \nto follow these “instructions provided by DPS…has nothing to do with the Westfall case [setting \nout the test for causation for purposes of standing to bring a constitutional claim] or with Plaintiffs’ \nability to sue.” Id. (emphasis deleted). This is wrong. \nThe “instructions provided by DPS” at which Plaintiffs scoff are necessary to comply with \nState law—which is part and parcel of the NVRA—and with the NVRA itself. That is, the NVRA, \nby its terms, covers “[e]ach State motor vehicle driver’s license application (including any renewal \napplication) submitted to the appropriate State motor vehicle authority under State law,” and “any \nchange of address form submitted in accordance with State law[.]” 52 U.S.C. §20504(a)(1); (d) \n(emphasis supplied).2 Texas law provides that “[a] change of address that relates to a license or \ncard and that is submitted in person or by mail serves as a change of address for voter registration \nunless the licensee or cardholder indicates that the change is not for voter registration purposes.” \nTEX.  ELEC.  CODE  §20.063(c)  (emphasis  supplied).  Texas  law  further  requires  a  signature, \naffirming under penalty of perjury that the individual making a change to voter registration \ninformation (and later, the individual who shows up to vote) is eligible to vote. TEX. ELEC. CODE \n                                                 \n2 Plaintiffs do not challenge any provision of Texas law in this case. In fact, they acknowledge that the NVRA was \nintended to afford States discretion “‘as to how to administer th[e] process and how to integrate it with [each State’s] \ndrivers license process.’” Response at 2 n.1 (quoting S. Rep. No. 103-6, at 5-6 (1993) (alteration original)). \n2 \n \n\n§63.002;  1  TEX.  ADMIN.  CODE  §81.58.  The  NVRA  requires  this,  too.  52  U.S.C. \n§20504(c)(2)(C)(iii). Thus, the “in person or by mail” requirement of Election Code §20.063(c) \nallows the State to verify the individual’s identity for voter registration purposes, to later check \nthat signature against the poll book, and to effectuate the NVRA’s signature requirement.  \nAs explained in Defendants’ motion to dismiss, a requirement that individuals provide a \nphysical signature when renewing or changing their voter registration information is wholly \nconsistent with the NVRA. MTD at 14-18.3 The in-person or by mail submission provided for in \nthe  Election  Code  is,  at  present,  the  only  means  to  effectuate  Texas’s  physical  signature \nrequirement. See P’s Ex. C (ECF 1-4) at 25-27. Plaintiffs acknowledge that their alleged injury \narises from their failure to follow the “instructions provided by DPS,” which require this in-person \nor by mail physical signature submission. Response at 8. Because Defendants may require such \nsubmission, and because Plaintiffs did not satisfy this requirement, their inability to cast a regular \nballot on Election Day is not fairly traceable to the Defendants. Instead, it is a result of their own \nfailure to comply with “instructions provided by DPS,” which are plainly incorporated into the \nNVRA. Indeed, to conclude otherwise would be to eviscerate all State requirements for voter \nregistration, which would violate the states’ time, place, and manner prerogative. See, e.g., \nCrawford v. Marion County Election Bd., 553 U.S. 181, 197 (2008). \nb.  Plaintiffs do not satisfy the NVRA’s notice requirement. \n \nThe NVRA specifically guarantees States an “‘opportunity to attempt compliance’ as to \n[each particular Plaintiff] ‘before facing litigation.’” Scott v. Schedler, 771 F.3d 831, 836 (5th Cir. \n                                                 \n3 Plaintiffs do not dispute that the online process provides individuals with a conspicuous warning that, if they do not \ncomplete and submit the mail-in form, their voter registration information will not be updated. Compl ¶40; P’s Ex. A \nat 2 (“Selecting ‘yes’ does not register you to vote. A link to the [SOS] voter website (where a voter application may \nbe downloaded or requested) will be available on your receipt page.”) (emphasis original). This, too, is consistent with \nthe NVRA. 52 U.S.C. §20504(d) (voter registration information need not be updated in change of address transaction \nwhere “the registrant states on the form that the change of address is not for voter registration purposes”). \n3 \n \n\n2014) (citation omitted). Plaintiffs did not provide that opportunity here. As noted in the motion \nto dismiss, the Scott panel concluded that “[p]roviding a potential plaintiff with a voter registration \nform is ‘exactly [the] sort of compliance attempt’ that [the NVRA’s] ‘pre-litigation notice was \nmeant to encourage.’” Id. (quoting Georgia State Conference of NAACP v. Kemp, 841 F.Supp.2d \n1320, 1336 (N.D.Ga. 2012)). Providing voter registration forms is precisely what the Defendants \nhave already done here. See, e.g., P’s Ex. A (ECF 1-2) at 2; Compl. ¶41. Moreover, Defendants \nhave made Plaintiffs’ counsel aware that they “remain happy to provide [] confirmation [of voter \nregistration status] should [Plaintiffs] choose to share address or other identifying information \nwhich would allow [SOS] to identify these individuals with particularity.” P’s Ex. C at 45, see also \nKemp, 841 F.Supp.2d at 1336 (letter that “offers the assistance of the Secretary of State’s office” \nalso demonstrates attempt to comply with the NVRA). Yet such information has not been \nforthcoming. Instead, Plaintiffs have stridently refused to permit the attempt at conciliation that \nthe NVRA contemplates. Thus, their attempts to establish notice are disingenuous. As in Scott, \n“[t]o the extent that [Plaintiffs] seek[] relief for [themselves] in this action, [they] ha[ve] no basis \nfor relief because [they] did not file notice. And consequently, [they are] not entitled to seek relief \nfor others, either.” 771 F.3d at 836. Without providing Defendants the opportunity to cure the \nviolations alleged, Plaintiffs have not provided the notice the NVRA requires. \nPlaintiffs diminish Defendants’ good-faith efforts to assist them in understanding the \nsignature requirement and verifying registration status, arguing that “[i]f states could immunize \nthemselves from suit by simply checking a complainant’s registration status or offering to register \nthem after the fact, no individual voter could ever enforce compliance with the NVRA, frustrating \nCongress’ intent to create a private right of action.” Response at 13 (citing 52 U.S.C. §20510) \n(emphasis supplied). Plaintiffs miss the point that Congress’ “intent” in enacting the NVRA was \n4 \n \n\nnot to embolden the plaintiffs’ bar or to encourage a litigious approach to policy reform. Rather, it \nwas to provide a meaningful mechanism to ensure NVRA compliance where suit would frequently \notherwise be barred by the states’ sovereign and Eleventh Amendment immunity. Pennhurst State \nSchool and Hospital v. Halderman, 465 U.S. 89, 97–98 (1984); Seminole Tribe of Florida v. \nFlorida, 517 U.S. 44, 64 (1996); 52 U.S.C. §20510(b)(1)-(2) (delineating a narrow waiver of state \nimmunity for private litigants who satisfy enumerated criteria). In the Fifth Circuit—from which \nPlaintiffs cite precious little authority—offering the assistance of the Secretary of State and \n“[p]roviding a potential plaintiff with a voter registration form is ‘exactly [the] sort of compliance \nattempt’ that ‘pre-litigation notice was meant to encourage.’” Scott, 771 F.3d at 863 (citation \nomitted). This is precisely what Defendants have done here. See, e.g., P’s Ex. A at 2. Plaintiffs’ \nrefusal to permit Defendants this opportunity divests them of NVRA standing for lack of notice. \nc.  If Plaintiffs have any standing at all, it is limited to the context of online \nchanges of address. \n \nIf the Court is to exercise any jurisdiction over this case, that jurisdiction must be limited \nto the context in which the Plaintiffs themselves claim to have suffered particularized injury—\nonline changes of address. That is, Plaintiffs have only alleged that they sought to change their \naddresses online, not that they sought to renew their driver licenses online. See Compl. ¶¶46-49 \n(Hernandez and Stringer each claim to have “updated his driver’s license address online,” while \nWatkins and Woods each claim to have “changed his [or her] driver’s license address online”). \nYet, they seek declaratory and injunctive relief in connection with online driver license renewals, \nin addition to online changes of address. It is a bedrock principle of standing that alleged injury \nmust be particularized, and “[f]or an injury to be ‘particularized,’ it ‘must affect the plaintiff in a \npersonal and individual way.’” Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins, 136 S. Ct. 1540, 1548 (2016), as revised \n(May 24, 2016) (collecting cases) (citations omitted). Online changes of address are the only \n5 \n \n\ncontext in which Plaintiffs themselves claim to have been denied any right. Thus, they have \nstanding only in that context, to the extent they have any standing at all.  \nII.  The Response does not save this case from dismissal for failure to state a claim. \n \nThe key facts of this case are not disputed. By law, Defendants require individuals who \nwish to change their voter registration information to submit an image of their physical signature, \neither in person or by mail. TEX. ELEC. CODE §20.063(c). Based upon the Defendants’ available \nresources and the requirements of State law, this signature can only be collected in person or by \nmail; Defendants have  not received a legislative appropriation to provide for its collection \nelectronically. P’s Ex. C at 25-27. Nevertheless, Defendants allow individuals to update their \ndriver license addresses online, which the Plaintiffs here claim to have done. During those \ntransactions, Plaintiffs were provided with a link to a voter registration application, and instructed \nto sign and mail the application in order to update their addresses for voter registration purposes. \nCompl. ¶¶40-41; P’s Ex. A at 2. Plaintiffs did not do this, thus, Defendants did not update their \nvoter registration information. On this basis, Plaintiffs seek declaratory relief that “Defendants \nhave violated the NVRA by failing to provide for simultaneous voter registration with online \ndriver’s license renewal [and] change-of-address forms.” Compl. at 17, Requests for Relief i, ii. \nThis relief cannot be granted on the facts alleged.4  \na.  Neither the NVRA’s text, legislative history, nor precedent imposes the \n“simultaneous registration” requirement Plaintiffs claim they were denied. \n \nIn their Response, Plaintiffs doggedly insist that states must provide “voter registration \nsimultaneous with any driver’s license application, renewal, or change-of-address transactions.” \n                                                 \n4 The remaining requests for relief set forth in the Complaint, likewise, depend upon an award of requests i and ii.  \n6 \n \n\nResponse at 1.5 They claim that Defendants are “refusing to offer simultaneous voter registration \nto those who renew or update their driver’s licenses online.” Reply at 1. This does not state a \nviolation  of  the  NVRA  for  two  independent  reasons.  First,  the  NVRA  does  not  require \n“simultaneous registration.” 52 U.S.C. §20504(a)(1); (c)(1). Instead, the NVRA provides for each \nstate to “establish procedures to register to vote in elections for Federal office by application made \nsimultaneously with an application for a motor vehicle driver’s license.” Id. §20503(a)(1). In fact, \nthe NVRA expressly contemplates that information collected in connection with changes of \naddress and renewals “shall be transmitted to the appropriate State election official not later than \n10 days after the date of acceptance.” Id. §20504(e)(l). Congress would not have specifically \nprovided state voter registration agencies with 10 days to transmit such information to State \nelection officials—who are responsible for updating that voter registration information—had the \nAct required instantaneous updates to the voting rolls. It is unsurprising, then, that Plaintiffs \n                                                 \n5 Compare, e.g., Response at 2 (mentioning “the simultaneous registration required by the NVRA”) (no citation in \nResponse), with Response at 2 n.1 (“Congress intended States to ideally create a system that ‘should be so designed \nas to include the voter registration application as a simultaneous, automatic part of the overall process…’”) (quoting \nS. Rep. No. 103-6 at 6 (1993)). See also Response at 1 (claiming NVRA requires “voter registration simultaneous \nwith  any  driver’s  license  application”),  Response  at  2  n.  1  (referring  to  “the  requirement  for  simultaneous \nregistration”), Response at 4 (explaining that Plaintiffs are suing because “Texas does not offer simultaneous voter \nregistration or address updates…”), Response at 8 (mentioning a “statutory right to be offered simultaneous voter \nregistration”), Response at 17 (claiming that “States must offer simultaneous voter registration to any applicant who \nsubmits a renewal application or change-of-address form…”), Response at 18 (asserting that “the NVRA requires [] \nsimultaneous voter registration with all lawful driver’s license transactions.”) See also Compl. at 9 n.1 “‘Simultaneous’ \nmeans ‘existing or occurring at the same time: exactly coincident.’” (citation omitted). \n \nSimilar imprecision is pervasive in Plaintiffs’ response. For instance, they also claim that “the State must use a \nsimultaneous application and cannot require duplicative information,” Response at 14 n.11. But the NVRA makes \nplain that duplicative information is permissible, so long as that information is limited to the “minimum amount of \ninformation necessary to prevent duplicate voter registrations and enable State election officials to assess the eligibility \nof  the  applicant  and  to  administer  voter  registration  and  other  parts  of  the  election  process.”  52  U.S.C. \n§20504(c)(2)(B). The NVRA leaves this determination to the states, consistent with their time, place, and manner \nprerogative and discretion to implement the NVRA in the context of their voter registration framework. See, e.g., \nArizona v. Inter Tribal Council of Arizona, Inc., 133 S. Ct. 2247, 2253 (2013), Response at 2 n.1 (quoting S. Rep. No. \n103-6, at 5-6 (1993). \n7 \n \n\nidentify no authority to support their bold and unprecedented reading that the NVRA requires \n“simultaneous registration” the moment an NVRA-covered transaction takes place. \nPlaintiffs emphasize a duty to construe statutes according to their plain meaning. Response \nat 16-17. Defendants agree that statutes should be applied based upon their plain meaning, but this \napproach undercuts Plaintiffs’ argument. That is, when the NVRA was enacted in 1994, the idea \nthat it would ever apply to online transactions would not have occurred to Congress. In 1994, the \ninternet was in its infancy, and few government functions were computerized to the point where \nthey  took  place  in  that  medium.  Plaintiff’s  argument  that  Congress  specified  particular \nrequirements for online, NVRA-covered transactions defies the plain meaning of the text as \nwritten. This is particularly so when the Act is considered in the of its 1994 enactment.6 \nThe NVRA’s plain meaning requires a simultaneous opportunity to apply to register to vote \n(or renew or change voter information), not a right to have such registration, renewal, or change \naffected  instantaneously.  Even  under  this  meaning,  Plaintiffs  still  have  not  stated  a  claim. \nPlaintiffs’ own allegations demonstrate that they were offered an opportunity to update their voter \nregistration information when updating their driver license addresses online. Compl. ¶40; P’s Ex. \nA at 2. That they did not complete the steps necessary to do so does not amount to any NVRA \nviolation by the Defendants, who have done what the NVRA requires. Indeed, the NVRA does not \nspecify a particular way that it must be applied in the context of online transactions—it did not \neven contemplate such transactions. And, in any event, Plaintiffs were not denied the opportunity \nto update their voter registration information when they interacted with DPS. They have therefore \nfailed to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. \n                                                 \n6 The NVRA specifically provides that, in order to be covered, Motor Voter transactions must also comply with state \nlaw. Because Texas law must be ignored in order to grant the relief requested, Plaintiffs’ “plain meaning” arguments \nfurther work against them. See supra, Part I(a). \n8 \n \n\nb.  Plaintiffs’ attempt to escape the signature requirement under Texas law \nand the NVRA is unpersuasive.  \n \nPlaintiffs attempt to avoid this inevitable result with a tepid suggestion that “applicants, \nlike Plaintiffs, who attempt to register to vote or update information online with DPS have \nelectronic signatures already on file with DPS, and that these electronic signatures are deemed \nsufficient for other DPS transactions.” Response at 15. This misunderstands what it means to state \na claim under the NVRA. That is, Plaintiffs did not submit an image of their signature, as Texas \nlaw requires for voter registration purposes. 1 TEX. ADMIN. CODE §81.58 (“a voter’s signature \nmay be captured by an electronic device for the signature roster. An ‘Electronic Signature’ is \ndefined as a digitized image of a handwritten signature.”)7 Texas’ requirements for driver licenses \nare irrelevant for purposes of voter registration, as NVRA-covered transactions still must comply \nwith relevant state voter registration law. 52 U.S.C. §20504(a)(1); (d). Plaintiffs’ arguments about \nwhat Texas considers sufficient for driver licensing, therefore, do not revive their lawsuit. \nNevertheless, Plaintiffs persist in their attempts to continue this case to discovery with the \nbizarre suggestion that Defendants plain statement of the applicable statutes—applied in the \ncontext of Plaintiffs’ factual allegations—makes a “fact-laden argument” that “cannot be the basis \nfor dismissal at this early juncture.” Response at 15 (citing Smith v. Regional Transit Auth., 756 \nF.3d  340,  347  (5th  Cir.  2014)  (“disputed  questions  of  fact  are  anathema  to  Rule  12(b)(6) \njurisprudence, unless those facts are immaterial to the outcome.”) Plaintiffs do not, however, \nidentify any question of fact that is disputed. Instead, they are displeased with the result the facts \n                                                 \n7 To the extent the Court chooses to exercise jurisdiction over Plaintiffs’ claims related to voter registration renewals, \nsupra, Part I(c), the NVRA requires a signature, too. 52 U.S.C. §§20504(c)(2)(C)(iii) (requiring, for voter registration \npurposes, “the signature of the applicant, under penalty of perjury”). See also, e.g., 139 Cong. Rec. S5642-01 (daily \ned. May 6, 1993) (statement of Sen. Ford) (“This bill [the NVRA] requires that, on every application for registration, \nthe requirements for eligibility must be clearly set forth, including citizenship. And every applicant signs a statement \nthat they meet each and every requirement, and that statement is signed under penalty of perjury.”) \n9 \n \n\ncompel—they have failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, and this case should \nbe dismissed.  \nc.  Requiring that updates to voter information be accompanied by a physical \nsignature—and therefore submitted in person or by mail—does not violate \nthe Equal Protection Clause. \n \nThe Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment commands that no State shall \n“deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws,’ which is essentially a \ndirection that all persons similarly situated should be treated alike.” City of Cleburne v. Cleburne \nLiving Ctr., Inc., 473 U.S. 432, 439 (1985). In the context of voting, the Supreme Court held in \nDunn v. Blumstein that citizens enjoy “a constitutionally protected right to participate in elections \non an equal basis with other citizens in the jurisdiction.” 405 U.S. 330, 336 (1972). The Court was \nquite clear—“[t]his ‘equal right to vote,’ is not absolute; the States have the power to impose voter \nqualifications, and to regulate access to the franchise in other ways.” Id. (citations omitted).  \nPlaintiffs claim that Defendants have violated the Equal Protection Clause “[b]y arbitrarily \nsubjecting Plaintiffs to disparate voter registration standards[.]” Compl. ¶59. But the requirement \nthe State has imposed—a physical signature, which must be submitted by mail when individuals \nchoose to update their driver licenses online—is required of all Texans who wish to update their \ndriver license information for voter registration purposes, no matter how they choose to do so. \nPlaintiffs do not claim that other individuals who changed their addresses online and did not mail \nin the form had their information updated. They have therefore failed to state an Equal Protection \nclaim. See, e.g., Cordi–Allen v. Conlon, 494 F.3d 245, 251 (1st Cir. 2007) (“[T]he proponent of \nthe equal protection violation must show that the parties with whom he seeks to be compared have \nengaged in the same activity vis-a-vis the government entity without such distinguishing or \n10 \n \n\nmitigating circumstances as would render the comparison inutile.”). Thus, as with the NVRA, \nPlaintiffs have failed to state a claim under the Equal Protection Clause. \nCONCLUSION \nPlaintiffs claim that, if Defendants do not read an instantaneous registration requirement \ninto the NVRA—while also reading out the signature requirement of Texas law and the NVRA \nitself—they are disenfranchising voters. This is preposterous. For the reasons set forth herein and \nin Defendants’ motion to dismiss, the Plaintiffs’ case should be dismissed in its entirety for lack \nof jurisdiction, and in the alternative, for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. \nRespectfully submitted, \n \nKEN PAXTON \nAttorney General of Texas \n \nJEFFREY C.
