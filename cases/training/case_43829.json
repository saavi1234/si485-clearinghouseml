    "summary": "<p>This case concerns the City of Atlanta&rsquo;s acquisition of property near Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport and its impact on the voting population of the City of College Park, a municipality separate of Atlanta near the airport and with a majority African-American population.&nbsp; On April 18, 2008, the plaintiffs, the City of College Park and a councilperson in College Park&rsquo;s fourth ward, represented by private counsel, filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia against the City of Atlanta, Shirley Franklin, in her capacity as Mayor of the City of Atlanta, and the State of Georgia. &nbsp;The case was assigned to Judge Julie Carnes.</p>\r\n<p>Plaintiff alleged that defendant used its statutory powers under Georgia law to operate Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport to acquire property near the airport, clear that property of any structures or voters, and then allow it to lie fallow indefinitely.&nbsp; Plaintiff alleged that by doing so, defendant fundamentally altered the territorial boundaries of College Park for electoral purposes; diminished the voting population of College Park; and changed the racial composition of the voting population of College Park.&nbsp; Specifically, Plaintiffs alleged that defendant's planned acquisition of Wynterbrook Apartments, a multi-family apartment complex in College Park and other multi-family complexes in College Park, was a <em>de facto</em> annexation of portions of College Park and a change in the &ldquo;standard, practice, or procedure with respect to voting&rdquo; within College Park.&nbsp; Plaintiff alleged that defendant had not sought preclearance for these changes as required by Section 5 of the Voting Right Act of 1965, 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1973c(a).&nbsp; Plaintiff sought declaratory and injunctive relief to remedy defendant&rsquo;s alleged violations of the preclearance procedures of the Voting Rights Act.&nbsp; Plaintiff also asked the Court to apply to the Chief Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit to appoint a three-judge court to hear the case. Plaintiff was represented by three private law firms. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The case involved the complicated relationship between noise abatement laws found in the Aviation Safety and Noise Abatement Act of 1979 (ANSA), 49 U.S.C. &sect; 47501 et seq., and Part 150 of Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations, a municipality's authority to acquire property, and the Voting Rights Act.&nbsp; Notably ANSA provided grants to facilitate defendant's acquisition of property. &nbsp; By accepting the grants, however, defendant was precluded from using the property for residential purposes. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The Complaint alleged that defendant had been steadily acquiring property within College Park since the 1960s. &nbsp;At the time plaintiff filed its Complaint in 2008, defendant owned 36% of College Park.&nbsp; The population of College Park steadily decreased from 28,203 in the 1970s to 18,414 at the time the Complaint was filed. &nbsp;For the first forty years of its acquisition activity in College Park, defendant acquired only single-family residences.&nbsp; Starting in 2006, however, defendant began acquiring multi-family dwellings in College Park. The Complaint alleged that defendant proposed to acquire Wynterbrook Apartments and several other multi-family complexes that had the same noise exposure from the airport. &nbsp; &nbsp;Since defendant planned to use ANSA grants to acquire these properties, none of them could be used for residential purposes. &nbsp;According to the Complaint, these acquisitions would increase defendant&rsquo;s ownership of College Park to approximately 38%, and decrease the voter base of College Park&rsquo;s fourth ward by approximately 3,000 voters, almost all of whom were African-American. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>At the same time plaintiff filed its complaint, plaintiff also filed a Motion for Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) to prevent defendant from acquiring Wynterbrook Apartments or any other property in College Park until further briefing on the matter of injunctive relief and on the propriety of a three-judge court. The Court granted the TRO on April 18, 2008 but also vacated as moot part of the Order that same day because defendant represented that it had completed its acquisition of the Wynterbrook site before the Court entered the TRO.&nbsp; The Court maintained the part of the Order that barred defendant from acquiring any other property in College Park.</p>\r\n<p>On April 21, 2008, the Court held a status conference denying injunctive relief at that time.&nbsp; The Court further ordered plaintiff to file a detailed pleading as to their likelihood of success on the merits.&nbsp; Defendant was granted thirty days to file a response to plaintiff's supplement.&nbsp; The parties agreed to a six-week injunctive period prohibiting defendant from razing any property in College Park.&nbsp; Thereafter, plaintiff filed its supplemental brief and defendant filed its answer.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On June 2, 2008, the Court issued a Consent Order dismissing the State of Georgia from the case without prejudice.&nbsp; On September 4, 2008, plaintiff filed a Motion for Leave to File a First Amended Complaint.&nbsp; &nbsp;Defendant opposed plaintiff's Motion.&nbsp; &nbsp;No further substantive activity occurred for several months.</p>\r\n<p>On March 31, 2009, the Court issued [i] an Order and Opinion; and [ii] Judgment, ruling on plaintiff's Request for Three-Judge Court and Motion for Leave to File First Amended Complaint.&nbsp; The Court denied these motions, dismissed the case in its entirety, and vacated its previous injunction. Regarding the Request for a Three-Judge Court, which the Court construed as a Motion, the Court denied the Motion because plaintiffs did not meet the requirements for declaratory relief and plaintiffs' allegations did not give rise to claims under Section 5.&nbsp; The Court ruled that Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act did not apply to a purchase of land under the facts alleged in the Complaint because defendant's purchase of land within College Park's boundaries did not change the composition of the electorate that may vote for candidates in a given office.&nbsp; Defendant had not altered municipal boundaries in College Park, which could only be altered through annexation or de-annexation procedures as defined by State law.&nbsp; With no jurisdiction over College Park, it was not possible for defendant to change College Park's boundaries.&nbsp; The Court noted that Plaintiffs had cited no case, nor had the Court found any case, in which an entity's purchase of property in a separate governmental voting jurisdiction violated Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act.&nbsp; The Court also found no case in which a plaintiff had successfully sued a jurisdiction that had no power over the electoral process in another jurisdiction. The Court also described Plaintiffs' Section 5 claim as \"pretextual\" because Plaintiffs' real grievances had nothing to do with voting rights; rather, the majority of plaintiffs' concerns related to other issues, such as loss of taxes, loss of utility payments, loss of contractual and business relationships, and loss of property values.&nbsp; Finding Plaintiffs' claims \"wholly insubstantial\" and \"completely without merit,\" the Court denied the Motion for a Three-Judge Court.</p>\r\n<p>The Court also rejected Plaintiffs' Motion for Leave to Amend the Complaint.&nbsp; Under Rule 15(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, a court may deny a motion for leave to amend when the amendment is \"futile,\" <em>i.e.,</em> subject to dismissal.&nbsp; Here, the amendment would be futile because Plaintiffs failed to state a claim for relief under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act.&nbsp; The Court also noted that even if Section 5 allowed a Court to undo Atlanta's land purchases over the last forty years, there were several practical problems with attempting to undo old land purchases, such as who would buy the land and at what price. Since the land had been purchased under ANSA, the land could not be used for residential purposes, a condition with which plaintiff would have to abide if it became the owner of the property.&nbsp; Thus, the Court questioned how the litigation would have helped plaintiff since voters could not occupy the property. While the Court recognized plaintiffs' frustration with defendant's land purchases in College Park over the years, the Court held that plaintiffs' quarrel with defendant should be waged before Congress, and that Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act \"provides no solace\" for addressing plaintiffs' concerns.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On April 30, 2009, plaintiff appealed the Court&rsquo;s Order and Opinion to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit (docket 09-12255-FF) and moved to restore the injunction pending the appeal. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On September 10, 2009, pursuant to a directive from the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, the parties mediated the case and reached a tentative settlement. &nbsp;On May 24, 2010, the parties filed a Joint Motion for Relief from Order and Opinion with the District Court. &nbsp;On August 2, 2010, the District Court entered a consent order which dismissed the case and set forth the terms of the settlement. Among other things, the settlement required defendant to invite and allow one representative to attend planning meetings and advance notice of any proposed action that, in the good faith determination of Atlanta, could materially affect the interests of College Park or a significant number of its citizens.&nbsp; The settlement also requires defendant to give plaintiff the option to purchase the Wynterbrook site at fair market value. &nbsp;If plaintiff declined to purchase the Wynterbrook site, defendant was required to engage an economic development specialist/land planner to assist it in returning the Wynterbrook site to productive use.&nbsp; Defendant further agreed to modify its Part 150 program to eliminate authorization to acquire any apartment complex within College Park other than one complex located at 3800 Herschel Road.&nbsp; Defendant further agreed to consult with plaintiff on what properties, identified in its existing and future Part 150 documents as eligible for receipt of noise mitigation funds, are mitigated and the timing of the mitigations. The Consent Order further required plaintiff to dismiss with prejudice two other lawsuits pending in Fulton County Superior Court.</p>\r\n<p>While the Consent Order ended all litigation between the parties, the Consent Order remains effective until further order of the Court or for fifty years, whichever shall first occur. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

    "summary_short": "In 2008, the City of College Park sued the City of Atlanta in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia for alleged violations of the pre-clearance provisions of Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act.  The case arose from Atlanta's acquisition of real property in College Park, a majority African American muncipality near Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport.  Through decades of land acquisitions, Atlanta owned approximately 36% of College Park.  According to the Complaint, these acquisitions changed the \"standard, practice or procedure with respect to voting\" in College Park, but Atlanta had not sought preclearance for these changes as required by the Voting Rights Act.  In 2010, the parties reached a settlement, contained in a Consent Order, that required Atlanta to, among other things, give College Park advance notice of actions that, in the good faith determination of Atlanta, could materially affect the interests of College Park or a significant number of its citizens.  The Consent Order remains in effect until further order of the Court, or for fifty years, whichever shall first occur.",

Phillips, Sr.\n(collectively \"Plaintiffs\") and file this Brief in Support of Motion for Temporary\nRestraining Order seeking a temporary injunction until a three judge court can be\nconvened', showing the Court as follows:\nI. STATEMENT OF FACTS\nDefendant City of Atlanta (\"Atlanta\") has been steadily eroding the voting\npopulation of the City of College Park by acquiring property in College Park that is\n' A single court judge has the authority to issue a temporary restraining order pending\nconsideration by a three judge court. Eastern States Petroleum Carp. v. Rof4Lrs, 265 F.2d 593,\n596 (D.C. Cir 1959).\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01464-JEC   Document 3-2   Filed 04/18/08   Page 2 of 11\naffected by aircraft noise related to Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International\nAirport. More specifically, Atlanta is using O.C.G.A. § 6-3-20, a state statute that\ngrants it certain powers with respect to the Airport, to acquire property within the\ngeographical limits of College Park, clear that property of structures and voters,\nand then allow it to lie fallow indefinitely . Although Atlanta has the discretion to\nrehabilitate (soundproof) such properties, it has instead chosen to systematically\nand continuously acquire and demolish them .\nWhereas Atlanta owned approximately seven percent of College Park in the\n1960s, it now owns approximately thirty-six percent of College Park . At the same\ntime, College Park's population has decreased from a high of 28,203 in the 1970s\nto only 18,414 today. This acquisition of College Park property, and elimination\nof College Park voters, is: (1) fundamentally altering the territorial boundaries of\nCollege Park for electoral purposes; (2) diminishing the voting population of\nCollege Park; and (3) changing the racial composition of that voting population.\nWithin the last two years, Atlanta has accelerated the pace of its acquisition\nof College Park property, and elimination of College Park voters, by acquiring\nmulti-family dwellings within College Park. Atlanta is currently in the process of\nacquiring Wynterbrook Apartments, a several hundred unit multi-family housing\ncomplex in College Park, along with other similar housing complexes along\n\"Frontage Road\" in College Park.\n-2-\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01464-JEC   Document 3-2   Filed 04/18/08   Page 3 of 11\nWith its acquisition of Wynterbrook Apartments and other multi-family\ncomplexes in College Park, Atlanta will irreparably harm College Park by\neffecting a de facto deannexation of portions of College Park and changing a\n\"standard, practice, or procedure with respect to voting\" within College Park .\nAtlanta, however, has not sought precf earance for this change as required by § 5 of\nthe Voting Rights Act of 1965, codified at 42 U.S.C. § 1973c(a). Accordingly,\nAtlanta's acquisition of this property is in violation of federal law .\nConcurrently with this Motion, Plaintiffs have filed their Verified Complaint\nfor Declaratory Judgment and Injunctive Relief against the City of Atlanta and the\nState of Georgia, asking the Court to: (1) convene a three judge court to hear this\ncase and determine whether Atlanta is required to seek preclearance under § 5 of\nthe Voting Rights Act prior to acquiring the Wynterbrook Apartments ; (2) declare\nthat Atlanta must seek and obtain preclearance under the Voting Rights Act before\nacquiring Wynterbrook Apartments ; and (3) enjoin Atlanta from acquiring the\nWynterbrook Apartments, or any other property within the City of College Park\nuntil it obtains such preclearance .\nIn the interim, Plaintiffs respectfully request the Court enter a temporary\nrestraining order enjoining Atlanta from acquiring the Wynterbrook Apartments, or\nany other property within the City of College Park, until either such acquisition is\n-3-\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01464-JEC   Document 3-2   Filed 04/18/08   Page 4 of 11\nprecleared in accordance with § 5 or the three judge court determines that such\npreclearance is not required.\nII. ARGUMENT AND CITATION TO AUTHORITY\nThe standard for obtaining a temporary restraining order (\"TRO\") in the\nEleventh Circuit is the same as that for obtaining a preliminary injunction . See\nParker v. State Bd. of Pardons and Paroles, 275 F .3d 1032, 1034-35 (11th Cir.\n2001). \"A TRO or preliminary injunction is appropriate where the movant\ndemonstrates that: (a) there is a substantial likelihood of success on the merits; (b)\nthe TRH or preliminary injunction is necessary to prevent irreparable injury; (c)\nthe threatened injury outweighs the harm that the TRO or preliminary injunction\nwould cause to the non-movant; and (d) the TRO or preliminary injunction would\nnot be adverse to the public interest.\" Id. (citing Zardui-Quintana v. Richard, 768\nF.2d 1213, 1216 (1 1 th Cir. 1985)).\nThe decision to grant or deny injunctive relief is within the sound discretion\nof the trial court. See Cafe 207, Inc. v. St. Johns County, 989 F.2d 1136, 1137\n(1 lth Cir. 1993). However, a district court \"must exercise its discretion in light of\nthe four prerequisites.\" Church v. City of Huntsville, 30 F .3d 1332, 1342 (11th\nCir. 1994). Accordingly, Plaintiffs simply must demonstrate to the Court that each\nof the four requirements is met so that the Court may issue a TRO . This Court\n-4-\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01464-JEC   Document 3-2   Filed 04/18/08   Page 5 of 11\nshould grant Plaintiffs' Motion because all four of the required elements are\nsatisfied. Each of these is addressed in more detai l below.\nA. Plaintiffs Have a Substantial Likelihood of Success on the Merits\nPlaintiffs are substantially likely to succeed on the merits of the case because\nthere is little question that Atlanta has violated Plaintiffs' rights under the § 5 of\nthe Voting Rights Act of 1965, codified at 42 U.S.C. § 1973c(a). Section 5 of the\nVoting Rights Act requires a political jurisdiction covered by the Act such as\nAtlanta, as a political subunit of Georgia-to obtain either judicial or\nadministrative preclearance before implementing changes in a \"standard, practice,\nor procedure with respect to voting\" different from that in force or effect on\nNovember 1, 1964. See Georgia v. Ashcroft, 539 U.S. 461, 461 (2003)\n(confirming that Georgia is a covered jurisdiction under § 5). In addition, the\nUnited States Supreme Court has held that \"[c]hanging boundary lines by\nannexations which enlarge the city's number of eligible voters also constitutes a\nchange of a `standard, practice, or procedure with respect to voting .\"' Perkins v.\nMatthews, 400 U.S. 379, 388 (1971).\nHere, through its purchase Wynterbrook Apartments and the other\ncomplexes, Atlanta will continue to alter the minority voting population and racial\ncomposition of College Park. These boundary changes are unquestionably changes\nin a standard, practice, or procedure with respect to voting rights. Nonetheless,\n-5-\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01464-JEC   Document 3-2   Filed 04/18/08   Page 6 of 11\nAtlanta has not filed preclearance for these changes are required by 42 U .S.C. §\n1973 c(a). Accordingly, Atlanta is operating in violation of federal law, and should\nbe temporarily restrained from closing on Wynterbrook Apartments and any other\nCollege Park property until it obtains the requisite preclearance or the three judge\ncourt determines that such preclearance is not required .\nB. An Injunction is Necessary to Prevent Plaintiffs from Suffering\nIrreparable Injury\nWithout restraining Atlanta's acquisition of Wynterbrook Apartments and\nthe other complexes, Plaintiffs will be irreparably injured. Once the property is\nsold, the land is cleared and the voters relocated . In the short run, if these\ntransactions are completed, Atlanta will increase its ownership of College Park to\napproximately thirty-eight percent, and decrease the voter base of College Park's\nfourth ward, which currently is comprised of approximately 4,900 voters, by\napproximately 3,000 voters, almost all of whom are African-American. In the long\nrun, if Atlanta is allowed to continue its campaign unabated, it will eliminate the\nvoters the voters of College Park and destroy the city .\nAlso, if this Court does not enter an injunction, Plaintiffs will be denied their\nrights under 42 U.S.C. § 1973c(a), which is irreparable harm itself. \"As to\nirreparable harm, it is well-settled that the claimed deprivation of a constitutional\nright such as the right to a meaningful vote or to the full and effective participation\nin the political process is in and of itself irreparable harm.\" Puerto Rican Legal\n-6-\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01464-JEC   Document 3-2   Filed 04/18/08   Page 7 of 11\nDefense and Educ. Fund, Inc. v. City of New York, 769 F. Supp. 74, 79 (E.D.N.Y.\n1991) (citing Reynolds V. Sims, 377 U.S. 533, 562, 565 (1964)). Atlanta's\nacquisition of Wynterbrook and the other complexes will essentially wipe out one\nof College Park's four wards, substantially diminishing the minority voting\npopulation and eliminating significant minority voting opportunities .\nC. The Injury Plaintiffs Will Suffer from Atlanta's Acquisition of\nWynterbrook Outweighs any Harm that the Injunction Would\nCause Atlanta\nThe injury Plaintiffs will suffer from Atlanta's acquisition of Wynterbrook\nor any other College Park property outweighs any potential harm Atlanta would\nsuffer from an injunction delaying or preventing the acquisition . College Park will\nsuffer by Atlanta depriving College Park's citizens of their rights under the Voting\nRights Act as well as losing voters and its property . Atlanta, by contrast, will\nsuffer only by being required to comply with federal law before attempting to\nacquire Wynterbrook and or any other College Park property which falls under 42\nU.S.C. § 1973c(a). Further, because Atlanta is prohibited by the terms of the\nfederal grant used for this acquisition, it can not use the property for residential\npurposes. Therefore, it will suffer no injury as a result of this injunction.\nD. An Injunction Would Not be Adverse to the Public Interest\nThere is no evidence to suggest that this Court's granting of Plaintiffs'\nMotion would harm the public interest . If anything, halting the attempted\n-7-\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01464-JEC   Document 3-2   Filed 04/18/08   Page 8 of 11\nacquisition of Wynterbrook until Atlanta complies with federal law would benefit\nthe public interest, especially the 3,000 minority citizens who comprise much of\nCollege Park's fourth ward and need this Court's intervention.\nIII. CONCLUSION\nFor all these reasons, Plaintiffs respectfully request this Court grant its\nMotion for Temporary Restraining Order and enter an Order preventing Atlanta\nfrom acquiring Wynterbrook Apartments or any other College Park property\nwithout obtaining preclearance under 42 U .S.C. § 1973c(a) or the three judge court\ndetermines that such preclearance is not required .\n_g_\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01464-JEC   Document 3-2   Filed 04/18/08   Page 9 of 11\nRespectfully submitted this 18th day of April, 2008 .\nr\nMichael J.

Phillips, Sr.\n(collectively \"Plaintiffs\") and file this Complaint, showing the Court as follows:\nIntroduction\nThe City of Atlanta (\"Atlanta\") is using O.C.G.A. § 6-3-20, a state statute\nthat grants it certain powers with respect to Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta\nInternational Airport, to acquire property within College Park, clear that property\nof any structures or voters, and then allow it to lie fallow indefinitely. By its\naction, Atlanta is: (1) fundamentally altering the territorial boundaries of College\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01464-JEC   Document 1   Filed 04/18/08   Page 2 of 15\nPark for electoral purposes; (2) diminishing the voting population of College Park ;\nand (3) changing the racial composition of that voting population.\nAtlanta is currently in the process of acquiring Wynterbrook Apartments, a\nmulti-family apartment complex located in the City of College Park, from Camp\nCreek, LLC. With its acquisition of Wynterbrook Apartments and other multi-\nfamily complexes in College Park, Atlanta is effecting a de facto deannexation of\nportions of College Park and a change in the \"standard, practice, or procedure with\nrespect to voting\" within College Park . Atlanta, however, has not sought\npreclearance for these changes as required by § 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 ,\ncodified at 42 U.S.C. § 1973c(a). Accordingly, Atlanta's acquisition of this\nproperty is in violation of federal law.\nAccordingly, Plaintiffs seek: (1) a declaratory judgment that Atlanta must\nobtain preclearance as required by § 5 of the Voting Rights Act before each\nindividual acquisition of property within College Park, including, but not limited\nto, the acquisition of the Wynterbrook Apartments ; and (2) an injunction\nprohibiting Atlanta from acquiring any additional property within College Park,\nincluding, but not limited to the Wynterbrook Apartments, prior to receiving such\n§ 5 preclearance.\n-2-\n\nE\nCase 1:08-cv-01464-JEC   Document 1   Filed 04/18/08   Page 3 of 15\nPersonal Jurisdiction and Venue\n1 .\nPlaintiff City of College Park is a Georgia municipal corporation, situated\nwithin Fulton County, and incorporated under the laws of the State of Georgia.\n2.\nPlaintiff Charles E. Phillips, Sr. is a citizen, voter, and council person of\nCollege Park, Georgia, domiciled in College Park's fourth ward .\n3.\nDefendant City of Atlanta is a municipal corporation incorporated under the\nlaws of the State of Georgia. It is a proper Defendant in this action for purposes of\nenforcement of the Voting Rights Act. Atlanta owns and operates Hartsfield-\nJackson Atlanta International Airport (\"H-JAIA\"), which is situated partially\nwithin the corporate limits of College Park. Service of process against Atlanta can\nbe pefected by serving its Mayor, Shirley Franklin, at her office, located at 55\nTrinity Avenue, Atlanta, Georgia, 30303 .\n4.\nDefendant Georgia is one of the United States. It is a proper Defendant in\nthis action for purposes of enforcement of the Voting Rights Act .

True and correct copies of maps depicting the portion\nof the City of College Park owned by Atlanta in each of these decades are attached\nhereto as Exhibit A.\n21 .\nAt the same time, College Park's population has decreased from a high of\n28,203 in the 1970s to only 18,414 today.\n22.\nFor the first forty years of such acquisitions, Atlanta acquired only single\nfamily homes in College Park.\n23 .\nWithin the last two years, however, Atlanta has accelerated the pace of its\nownership of College Park by acquiring multi-family dwellings within College\nPark as well.\n. _\n.7\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01464-JEC   Document 1   Filed 04/18/08   Page 8 of 15\n24.\nTo that end, Atlanta recently amended its NCP to include the acquisition of\nmulti-family dwellings that are affected by aircraft noise.\n25.\nAs approved, Atlanta has the discretion to acquire and demolish these\ndwellings or to acquire and rehabilitate such properties .\n26.\nAtlanta is now attempting to acquire Wynterbrook Apartments, a multi-\nfamily apartment complex located at 2600 Camp Creek Parkway, located within\nCollege Park, which has a DNL of approximately 70 dB noise exposure from the\nairport.\n27.\nBecause Atlanta has agreed to accept ASNA grants for that acquisition, it is\nprecluded from using that property for residential purposes.\n28.\nIn addition to acquiring Wynterbrook Apartments, Atlanta also plans to\nacquire several other multi-family complexes along a street known as \"Frontage\nRoad,\" which all received the same noise exposure from the airport .\n29.\nThe City intends to acquire Wynterbrook Apartments and the other\ncomplexes on the basis that the area's 70dB DNL qualifies the property for land\n-8-\n\nz Case 1:08-cv-01464-JEC   Document 1   Filed 04/18/08   Page 9 of 15\nacquisition under federal and state law.\n30.\nAs with Wynterbrook Apartments, Atlanta will be precluded from using\nthese other apartment complexes for residential purposes.\n31 .\nBy acquiring all of these apartment complexes, Atlanta would increase its\nownership of College Park to approximately 38%, and decrease the voter base of\nCollege Park's fourth ward, which currently is comprised of approximately 4,900\nvoters, by approximately 3,000 voters, almost all of whom are African-American.'\n32.\nOn or around April 1, 2008, the Atlanta City Council approved the\nappropriation of $2,000,000 in City funds to match approximately $8,000,000 in\nfederal funds granted from the FAA for the purchase of Wynterbrook Apartments .\nCOUNT I\nVIOLATION OF THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT\n33 .\nPlaintiffs incorporate Paragraphs 1 through 32 as though set forth fully\nherein.\nIn 2000, there were 20,382 people, 7,810 households, and 4,600 families residing in the\nCity of College Park. See http://censtats.census.2ovldata/GA/16013177?6.Qd£ The racial\nmakeup of the City was 81 81 % African American, 12 .39% White, 0.17% Native American,\n0.61% Asian, 3.33% from other races, and 1.69% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of\nany race were 6.86% of the population.\n-9-\n\n1 Case 1:08-cv-01464-JEC   Document 1   Filed 04/18/08   Page 10 of 15\nf\n34.\nSection 5 of the Voting Rights Act requires a political jurisdiction covered\nby the Act to obtain either judicial or administrative preclearance before\nimplementing any change in a \"standard, practice, or procedure with respect to\nvoting\" different from that in force or effect on November 1, 1964 .\n35.\nThe State of Georgia and its political subunits, including Atlanta, are\npolitical jurisdictions covered by the Voting Rights Act.\n36.\nAtlanta is using O.C.G.A. § 6-3-20, a state statute that grants it certain\npowers with respect to Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, to acquire\nproperty within the geographical limits of College Park, clear that property, and\nthen allow it to lie fallow indefinitely.\n37.\nAtlanta is currently in the process of acquiring Wynterbrook Apartments, a\nmufti-family apartment complex located in the City of College Park, from Camp\nCreek, LLC for that very purpose.\n38.\nWith each acquisition of property in College Park, Atlanta is fundamentally\naltering the territorial boundaries for electoral purposes, the voting population, and\nthe racial composition of that population within the City of College Park .\n-10-\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01464-JEC   Document 1   Filed 04/18/08   Page 11 of 15\n39.\nBy its action, Atlanta is effecting a de facto deannexation of portions of\nCollege Park, reducing College Park's eligible minority voter base, and changing\nthe \"standards, practices, or procedures with respect to voting\" within College\nPark.\n40.\nBecause these acquisitions constitute a change in the \"standards, practices,\nor procedures with respect to voting\" within College Park, Atlanta must preclear\neach proposed acquisition, either by submitting it to the U.S. Attorney General for\napproval, or securing a declaratory judgment from the District Court for the\nDistrict of Columbia, that the change does not have a racially discriminatory\npurpose or effect.\n41 .\nAtlanta has not sought preclearance for these changes from the Attorney\nGeneral of the United States or the United States District Court for the District of\nColumbia, as required by § 5 of the Voting Rights Act the Voting Rights Act.\n42.\nUntil Atlanta receives the required preclearance, acquisition of any\nadditional property within College Park is unlawful at this time.\n-11-\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01464-JEC   Document 1   Filed 04/18/08   Page 12 of 15\n43.\nPlaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law to challenge the unconstitutional\nacquisition of College Park property, and Plaintiffs will be irreparably harmed if\nAtlanta acquires Wynterbrook Apartments and other property within College Park\nwithout complying with § 5 of the Voting Rights Act.\n44.\nIf Atlanta is allowed to proceed on its current course, it will inevitably\ndestroy the City of College Park by eliminating all of its voters .\n45.\nFor each of these reasons, Plaintiffs are entitled to declaratory judgment that\nAtlanta must obtain preclearance before closing on Wynterbrook Apartments or\nany other property with the geographic boundaries of the City of College Park.\n46.\nFor each of these reasons, Plaintiffs are also entitled to injunctive relief\nrequiring Atlanta to seek preclearance before attempting to acquire additional\nproperty within the City of College Park .\nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully pray that this Court grant the\nfollowing relief:\n(a) Assume jurisdiction of this case ;\n(b) Make application to the Chief Judge of the Circuit to appoint a three-\n12-\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01464-JEC   Document 1   Filed 04/18/08   Page 13 of 15\njudge court to hear this case and determine whether Atlanta is required to seek\npreclearance under § 5 of the Voting Rights Act prior to aquiring any additional\nproperty, including but not limited to the Wynterbrook Apartments, within the City\nof College Park;\n(c) Enter a declaratory judgment that Atlanta must seek and obtain\npreclearance under the Voting Rights Act before acquiring any additional property,\nincluding but not limited to the Wynterbrook Apartments, within the City of\nCollege Park;\n(d) Enter an Order enjoining Atlanta from acquiring any additional\nproperty, including but not limited to the Wynterbrook Apartments, within the City\nof College Park until it seeks and obtains pryclearance in accordance with § 5 the\nVoting Rights Act; and\n(e) All such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper .\n- 13-\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01464-JEC   Document 1   Filed 04/18/08   Page 14 of 15\nRespectfully submitted this 1 8th day of April, 2008 .\nMichael J.

Because Atlanta did not preclear\nits recent purchase of an apartment complex in College Park,\nplaintiffs contend that this purchase, must- be undone until the\nDepartment completes the necessary preclearance procedures . As .any.\nnon-frivolous claim alleging a failure to comply with Section 5 must\nbe heard by a three-judge panel, plaintiff has requested that this\ncourt convene such a panel so that the latter may resolve the merits\nof plaintiffs' ultimate claim seeking a requirement of preclearance\non any future purchases .\nPlaintiffs in this case are the City of College Park, which is\na municipal corporation in_Fulton County, Georgia, and Charles E :\nPhillips, Sr ., \"a citizen, voter, and : council person of College\nPark .\" (Compl .

The ASNA permits cities to. reduce incompatible\nland uses in the vicinity of airports where airplane noise has\nrendered the land less desirable for residential use .\nIn April 2008, Atlanta purchased an apartment complex within the\nmunicipal boundaries of College Park--Wynterbrook Apartments\n(\"Wynterb.rook\")--as .part of this federally approved noise abatement\nprogram .

Thus, plaintiffs contend that Atlanta's purchase of property in\nCollege Parkconstitutes a \"de facto de[-]annexation\" that results in\nthe change of the boundaries of a voting unit . (See Comp1 .

Clearly, Atlantaa has no power to annex or alter the\nboundaries of another jurisdiction . Both state and federal law\nsanction Atlanta's past purchases of property near the airport .\nWhile such purchases in the future may change somewhat the makeup of\nproperty owners in College Park, they do not contract College Park's\nterritorial boundaries so as to result in a de-annexation .\nMoreover, to prevail on a claim that College Park property .has\nbeen de-annexed, plaintiffs must allege that College Park's municipal\nboundaries in existence on November 1, 1964 were altered. - See\nPresley, 502 U .S . at 495.

In order to rule that Atlanta be required to pre-\nclear its noise abatement purchases of property, this Court- would\nhave to make a huge leap that would expand the kind of action covered\nby Section 5 beyond that previously recognized by any other court .\nIf the Court determined that a referral to a three-judge. panel were\nnecessary, a limitless number of factual scenarios that were not\ncontemplated by the statute would be referred to three-judge panels . .\nSuch a resultwould greatly burden the federal court system, as well\nas local governments, whose decision--making would be subject to\nincreased micromanagement by the federal government .\nAdditionally, plaintiffs' Section Five claim seems pretextual,\nas their real grievances have nothing to do with voting rights .

(See, e . g., Pls .'\nSupplemental Br . [23] at 3-4 .) However, nowhere does the aviation\nstatute require an entity to consider a soundproofing option before\nrazing ., Likewise, plaintiffs' argument that Atlanta should acquire\nsingle-family homes rather-than multiple-family homes is also beside\nthe point .
