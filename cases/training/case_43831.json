    "summary": "<p>This is a case about a registered voter's issue with the Democratic National Convention's decision to eliminate the number of delegates that the state of Florida had to the national convention unless the Florida Democratic Party modified the date of its primary elections to comply with the Democratic National Convention's rules.</p>\r\n<p>On August 30, 2007, a registered Democratic voter in the state of Florida filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court in the Middle District of Florida. The plaintiff sued the Democratic National Committee and the Florida Democratic Party under the Equal Protection Clause under the Fourteenth Amendment and under Article II of the Constitution. Represented by counsel, the plaintiff sought a declaratory judgment determining the rights and obligations of the parties. He claimed that his constitutional rights were violated when the Democratic National Committee imposed its sanction for violating its rule.</p>\r\n<p>Pursuant to the rules of the Democratic National Committee (\"DNC\"), no state presidential preference primary election may be held prior to the first Tuesday in February or after the second Tuesday in June, in the calendar year of the national convention, except for in the states of New Hampshire, Iowa, Nevada, and South Carolina. The rules also provide that the DNC may impose sanctions for violations by a state of these rules, including elimination of the number of delegates the state has to the national convention. In 2007, the State of Florida enacted a law which provided that political parties shall, on the last Tuesday in January in each year the number of which is a multiple of four, \"elect one person to be the candidate for nomination of such part for President of the United Staes or select delegates to the national nominating convention, as provided by party rule.\" In 2008, that date would be January 29th. Because such a law violates the DNC rule that primary elections be held prior to the first Tuesday in February, on August 25, 2008, the DNC members voted not to allow Florida to seat delegates at the national convention unless the State Democratic Party moved its contest back at least seven days from the current January 29, 2008 date. The plaintiff's complaint alleged that the DNC imposing such sanctions \"may be violating his rights under Article II and the 14th Amendment of the United States Constitution.\" He further alleged that the Florida Democratic Party had an obligation to its members in the state to ensure that its members are represented at the national convention and are allowed to participate in selecting the Democratic nominee for president. Plaintiff also stated in his complaint that the DNC rule that permits its members to adopt an alternative delegate system selection that does not violate its rules (selecting a new, earlier date) \"may or may not violate the Plaintiff&rsquo;s right to vote in a Presidential primary election as provided for in the laws of the state where he resides.\" The plaintiff's complaint concluded by writing that if the decision of the DNC violated his constitutional rights, \"it would be appropriate for this court to make such a finding\" and if they did not violate his constitutional rights, it would be appropriate for the court to determine whether the DNC and Florida Democratic Party may implement an alternative delegate selection system that complies with DNC rules.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Less than one week after filing his complaint, the plaintiff filed a motion for summary judgment on September 5, 2007. In the motion, the plaintiff asked the court to declare that he was legally entitled to vote on January 29, 2008 in the party's statewide presidential preference primary, and that the delegates elected on that date are legally entitled to vote at the party's national nominating convention. He argued that action by the defendants were \"governmental actions\" for purposes of enforcing Article II and Amendment 14 of the U.S. Constitution. Specifically, he argued that both the Florida Democratic Party and the DNC \"are agents of the state insofar as they determine the participants in a primary election (as well as the general election), and must not violate the constitutional rights of the Plaintiff in performing their duties.\" That same day, the Court denied the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment for two reasons. First, the Court lacked personal jurisdiction over the defendants because he had not affected service of process on the defendants. Second, a party seeking a declaratory judgement may not move for summary judgment until after 20 days from the commencement of the action.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On September 25, 2007, the defendants both filed motions to dismiss the plaintiff's complaint. The DNC argued as follows: (1) the facts stated in the complaint did not establish that DNC acted under color of state law and therefore, it could not violate the 14th Amendment; (2) it was well-established that the national political parties have a constitutionally-protected right to determine the method of selection of delegates to their national conventions and states did not have the power to require parties to recognize the results of state-run primaries in the selection of delegates; and there was no countervailing right on the part of an individual voter to dictate the method of delegate selection or to use the courts to do so; and (3) the plaintiff was not entitled to a declaratory judgment because he did not assert that the DNC's actions actually violated any law or that he has been injured by such action, rather, he asked for an advisory opinion. The Florida Democratic Party argued in its motion to dismiss that the plaintiff lacked standing because he failed to establish injury in fact from any action taken by the Florida Democratic Party and any allegations were mere speculation as to whether or not his constitutional rights have been violated. The Florida Democratic Party asserted that the plaintiff himself even alleged that the Florida Democratic Party had no obligation to ensure compliance with the rules of the DNC and the DNC was a private association that may choose to define their associational rights by limiting who can participate in any delegate selection process. The Florida Democratic Party also argued that the plaintiff failed to state a claim because Article II does not confer any type of actionable right upon an individual voter and the Florida Democratic Party was a private actor and thus cannot be subject to actions brought under the 14th Amendment.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On October 5, 2007, the Court granted the defendants' motions to dismiss and dismissed the plaintiff's complaint with prejudice, finding that allowing him to amend to cure the deficiencies would be an exercise in futility. The Court held that the plaintiff did not have standing to bring his complaint. For the plaintiff to have had standing, he would have had to have suffered an injury in fact, which means an invasion of a legally protected interest which is concrete and particularized and actual or imminent as opposed to conjectural or hypothetical. It must also be likely, not speculative, that the plaintiff's injury will be redressed by a favorable decision by the court. The fact that the plaintiff in this action invoked the Declaratory Judgment Act in support of relief from the Court did not relieve him of the burden of satisfying the constitutional prerequisite for standing. The plaintiff in this case did not assert any actual or real controversy with the defendants, but instead, wrote that they \"may or may not\" be violating his rights. Such allegations are mere speculation. The plaintiff also is asking the Court for an advisory opinion with respect to actions and obligations of the defendants, which is not the function of the Court. The Court also held that even if the plaintiff did have standing, he failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. Article II of the U.S. Constitution does not confer any actionable right on any individual voter, instead, it directs state legislatures to determine the manner in which electors for the offices of President and Vice President shall be appointed and provides the manner in which those electors shall perform their duties. With respect to the plaintiff's equal protections right claim, the Court found that the DNC and the Florida Democratic Party do not exercise any power conferred or delegated by the state of Florida, rather they are private actors. Finally, the Supreme Court has consistently and repeatedly recognized that national political parties have a constitutionally protected right to manage and conduct their own internal affairs, including the enforcement of delegate selection rules and the decision as to which state delegates it will recognize, under the First Amendment&rsquo;s right to freedom of association, and that associational right generally prevails over any countervailing state interest or the interest of any individual voter.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On October 10, 2007, the plaintiff filed a notice of appeal to the Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit (docket no. 07-14816). On March 21, 2008, the 11th Circuit affirmed the dismissal of the plaintiff's complaint for lack of standing. However, the 11th Circuit held that such dismissal should have been without prejudice. The 11th Circuit held that the plaintiff lacked standing because he never alleged that he actually voted, nor even so much suggested that he intended to vote in the Florida Democratic Primary. to the contrary, he simply alleged that his rights \"may or may not\" have been violated. However, a dismissal for lack of standing, as the case here, the dismissal is necessarily without prejudice. On April 8, 2008, the district court amended its order dated October 5, 2007 to reflect that the plaintiff's complaint is dismissed without prejudice.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The case is now closed.&nbsp;</p>",

This is an action for declaratory relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยงยง 1331,1343  \nand 2201.  \n2.  Venue  is  proper  in  this  judicial  district  pursuant  to  28  U.S.C.  ยง  1391(b) \nbecause  a  substantial  part  of  the  real  and  immediate  harm  faced  by  the \nPlaintiff is threatened in this judicial  district . \n3.  Defendant, Democratic National Committee (hereinafter National Party) is the \nofficial representative entity of the Democratic Party, and is responsible for, \namong  other  things,  promulgating  delegate  selection  rules  for  the  2008 \nDemocratic National Convention. \n4.  Defendant, Florida Democratic Party (hereinafter State Party) is the official \nrepresentative entity of the Democratic Party in the state of Florida, and is \nresponsible for, among other things, ensuring compliance with the rules of the \n\nCase 8:07-cv-01552-RAL-MAP     Document 1     Filed 08/30/07     Page 2 of 4 PageID 2\nNational  Party  regarding  the  delegate  selection  process  for  the  2008 \nDemocratic National Convention. \n5.  Plaintiff is an adult citizen of Hillsborough County, Florida,  a registered \nvoter, and has selected the Democratic Party as the political party with whom \nhe chooses to be affiliated \n6.  Rules  of  the  National  Party  provide  that  no  state  presidential  preference \nprimary election may be held prior to the first Tuesday in February or after the \nsecond Tuesday in June, in the calendar year of the national convention, \nexcept for the states of New Hampshire, Iowa, Nevada, and South Carolina. \nAttached hereto is a copy of said rules, marked exhibit โAโ and made a part \nhereof by reference. \n7.  The  aforesaid  rules  further  provide  that  the  National  Party  may  impose \nsanctions for violations by a state of these rules, including the reduction or \nelimination of the number of delegates to the national convention. \n8.  In 2007, the State of Florida,  enacted a law (now titled F.S. 103.101), which \nprovided for, among other things, that  โ Each political party other than a \nminor political party shall, on the last Tuesday in January in each year the \nnumber of which is a multiple of 4, elect one person to be the candidate for \nnomination of such party for President of the United States or select delegates \nto the national nominating convention, as provided by party ruleโ \n9.  On or about August 25, 2008, the Defendantโs national committee members \nvoted not to allow Florida to seat delegates at the national convention, because \n  2\n\nCase 8:07-cv-01552-RAL-MAP     Document 1     Filed 08/30/07     Page 3 of 4 PageID 3\nof the enactment of the law moving Floridaโs primary to a date which violates \nthe national rules, unless within 30 days the State Democratic Party moves its \ncontest back at least seven days from the current Jan. 29, 2008 date. \n10.  Plaintiff posits that by imposing sanctions of refusing to recognize the results \nof Floridaโs primary election, pursuant to Florida Statute 103.101, and by \nrefusing  to  seat  the  Florida  delegation  so  elected,  the  Defendant  may  be \nviolating his rights under Article II and the 14th Amendment   of the United \nStates Constitution. \n11.  Plaintiff further posits the State Party has an obligation to its members in the \nstate of Florida, to ensure that its members are represented at the national \nconvention and are allowed to participate in selecting the Democratic nominee \nfor president \n12.  While  the  Defendant,  National  Party,  is  a  private  organization,  and  may, \nspeaking through their rules, choose to define their associational rights by \nlimiting who can participate in any binding process leading to the selection of \ntheir delegates to their National Convention, they may or may not refuse to \nseat delegates who are members of their party and were elected according to \ntheir rules, because the state in which the electors of the delegates resided, \nscheduled its primary election earlier than as provided for in the National \nPartyโs rules.  \n13.  The rules of the National Party provide that a state party may be required by a \nvote of the DNC Executive Committee upon recommendation of the DNC \n  3\n\nCase 8:07-cv-01552-RAL-MAP     Document 1     Filed 08/30/07     Page 4 of 4 PageID 4\nRules and Bylaws Committee to adopt and implement an alternative Party-run \ndelegate selection system which does not conflict with their rules. These rules \nmay or may not violate the Plaintiffโs right to vote in a Presidential primary \nelection as provided for in the laws of the state where he resides. \n14.  If the decision of the National Party violates the Plaintiffโs constitutional \nrights, it would be appropriate for this court to make such a finding. \n15.  If  the  decision  of  the  National  Party  does  not  violate  the  Plaintiffโs \nconstitutional rights, it would be appropriate for this court to make such a \nfinding and to further determine whether the National Party and State Party \nmay implement an alternative Party-run delegate selection system which does \nnot conflict with the National Party rules, without running afoul of the laws of \nthe state of Florida. \nWherefore,  the  Plaintiff,  Victor  DiMaio,  requests  that  this  court  assume \njurisdiction  and  enter  a  declaratory  judgment    determining  the  rights  and \nobligations of the parties herein. \nRespectfully Submitted,  \n              s/Michael A.

As  fully  demonstrated  below,  and  in  the  accompanying \nmemorandum and exhibits, Plaintiff is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law. \nPreliminary Statement: \nThis case pertains to the legality of threatened actions of a national political party \nto disallow participation of duly elected delegates from the State of Florida, to its national \nnominating convention, in selecting its nominee to be a candidate for President of the \nUnited States.  \n  Florida Statute 103.101 explicitly provides that on the last Tuesday in January in \neach year, the number of which is a multiple of four, each party shall elect one person to \n\nCase 8:07-cv-01552-RAL-MAP     Document 4     Filed 09/05/07     Page 2 of 10 PageID 49\nbe the candidate for nomination of such party for President of the United States or select \ndelegates to the national nominating convention, as provided by party rule. The statute \ndoes not provide for an alternate method for the state party branch of the national \npolitical party to select delegates. \n  The aforesaid statute further provides that the state executive committee of each \nparty, by rule adopted at least 120 days prior to the presidential preference primary \nelection, shall determine the number, and establish procedures to be followed in the \nselection of delegates and delegate alternates from each candidateโs supporters. A copy of \nany rule adopted by the executive committee shall be filed with the Department of State \nwithin seven days after its adoption and shall become a public record. The Department of \nState shall review the procedures and shall notify the state executive committee of each \npolitical party of any ballot limitation. The Department of State may promulgate rules for \nthe orderly conduct of the presidential preference primary ballot.  \n  Rules of the National Party provide that no state presidential preference primary \nelection may be held prior to the 1st Tuesday in February or after the 2nd Tuesday in June, \nin the calendar year of the national convention, except for the States of New Hampshire, \nIowa, Nevada, and South Carolina. These rules further provide that the National Party \nmay impose sanctions for violations by a state of these rules, including the reduction or \nelimination of the number of delegates to the national convention. In addition, the rules of \nthe National Party provide that a state party may be required by a vote of the DNC \nExecutive Committee, upon recommendation of the DNC rules and bylaws committee, to \nadopt and implement an alternate party-run delegate selection, which does not conflict \n\nCase 8:07-cv-01552-RAL-MAP     Document 4     Filed 09/05/07     Page 3 of 10 PageID 50\nwith their rules. The Plaintiff seeks a declaration as to the rights and obligation of the \nparties herein. \nSTANDING \nThe Plaintiff contends that this court has standing to enter a declaratory judgment \npursuant to 28 U.S.C. 2201, which provides in part, that โin a case of actual controversy \nwithin its jurisdiction... any court of the United States, upon the filing of an appropriate \npleading, may declare the rights and other relations of any interested party seeking such \ndeclaration, whether or not, further relief is or could be sought. Any such declaration \nshall have the force and effect of a final judgment or decree and shall be reviewable as \nsuch.โ  Article III section 2 of the United States Constitution grants jurisdiction to this \ncourt of cases arising under the United States Constitution.  \nArticle  III  standing  requires  a  party  to  show  actual  injury,  a  causal  relation \nbetween that injury and the challenged conduct, and the likelihood that a favorable \ndecision by the court will redress the alleged injury Lugan v. Defenders of Wildlife 504 \nU.S. 555, 560-61 (1992.) \nWhen government action or inaction is challenged by a party who is a target or \nobject of that action, as in this case, โthere is ordinarily little question that the action or \ninaction has caused him injury and that a judgment preventing or requiring the action will \nredress itโ Lugan, 504 U.S. at 561. \nIn the case of Cousins v. Wigoda 419 U.S. 477 (1975), following a primary, \nCousins brought a declaratory judgment action seeking a ruling that he was duly elected \nto the Democratic Nominating Convention in accordance with Illinois law and sought an \ninjunction  against  Respondent  to  prohibit  them  from  interfering  or  impeding  the \n\nCase 8:07-cv-01552-RAL-MAP     Document 4     Filed 09/05/07     Page 4 of 10 PageID 51\nfunctioning of the Petitioner  a duly elected delegate. In that case, the District Court \nassumed jurisdiction. \n  In the case of Terry v. Adams 345 U.S. 461 (1953), Plaintiffs were Blacks who \ninstituted an action against a political party in district court for declaratory and injunctive \nrelief.  The district court assumed jurisdiction and entered an order declaring Plaintiffs \nwere legally entitled to vote in the partyโs primary election.  \n  The Plaintiff herein has instituted an action against a political party asking the \ncourt to declare that he is legally entitled to vote on January 29, 2008 in the partyโs \nstatewide presidential preference primary, and that the delegates elected on that date, are \nlegally entitled to vote at the partyโs national nominating convention. \n  While the outcome of how the court should decide will be addressed below, it is \nclear that this court has jurisdiction, plaintiffs have standing, and that the issue is ripe. \nIs action by a national political party โgovernmental actionโ for purposes of \nenforcing Article II and Amendment 14 of the United States Constitution? \n  In the case of Smith v. Allwright 321 U.S. 649 (1944), the Supreme Court of the \nUnited Stated declared that the right to vote in a primary election for the nomination of \ncandidates, without discrimination by the state, like the right to vote in the general \nelection, is a right secured by the constitution. \n  The Supreme Court held that a state is free to conduct her elections as she may \ndeem wise, unless her actions are prohibited by the United States Constitution or in \nconflict with powers delegated to and exercised by the federal government. \n  The Respondents in that case contended that the Democratic Party of Texas was a \nvoluntary  organization  with  members  banded  together  for  the  purpose  of  selecting \n\nCase 8:07-cv-01552-RAL-MAP     Document 4     Filed 09/05/07     Page 5 of 10 PageID 52\nindividuals of the group representing the common political beliefs as candidates in the \ngeneral  election.  They  further  contended  that  as  such  a  voluntary  organization,  the \nDemocratic Party was free to select its own membership and limit to whites participation \nin the party primary. They finally argued that elections are political party affairs, handled \nby the party and not government officers.  \n  The court examined whether the action of the party was state action or private \naction.  It  was  determined  that  since  primaries  were  conducted  by  the  party  under \nstatutory authority, the party was an agency of the state insofar as it determined the \nparticipants in a primary election. The party took its character as a state agency from the \nduties imposed upon it by state statutes, and the duties did not become matters of private \nlaw, because they were performed by a political party. \n  Therefore, the Plaintiff posits that both the State Party and National Party are \nagents of the state insofar as they determine the participants in a primary election (as well \nas the general election), and must not violate the constitutional rights of the Plaintiff in \nperforming their duties. \nWould an order declaring that the National party must accept the delegates selected \nby the voters of the State of Florida in the Presidential Preference Primary Election \nscheduled for January 29, 2008, violate the National partyโs constitutional rights? \n  In Democratic Party of U.S. v. Wisconsin 450 U.S. 107 (1991), the court stated \nthat โThe question in this case is not whether Wisconsin may conduct an open primary \nelection if it chooses to do so or whether the National Party may require Wisconsin to \nlimit its primary election to publicly declared democrats. Rather, the question is whether, \nonce Wisconsin has opened its democratic presidential preference primary to voters who \n\nCase 8:07-cv-01552-RAL-MAP     Document 4     Filed 09/05/07     Page 6 of 10 PageID 53\ndo not publicly declare their party affiliation, it may then bind the National Party to honor \nthe binding primary results, even though those results were reached in a manner contrary \nto the National Party rules.โ In that case the court cited the case of Cousins v. Wigoda \n419 U.S. 477, which stated that โthe National Democratic Party and its adherents enjoy a \nconstitutionally protected right of political association.  The First Amendment freedom to \ngather and associate for the purpose of advancing shared beliefs is protected by the \nFourteenth Amendment from infringement by any state. The freedom to associate for the \ncommon advancement of political beliefs necessarily presupposes the freedom to identify \nthe people who constitute the association, and to limit the association to those people \nonly.โ \n  The Supreme Court in Democratic Party of U.S. v. Wisconsin went on to state \nโHere, the members of the National Party, speaking through their rules, choose to define \ntheir associational rights by limiting those who could participate in the process leading to \nthe selection of delegates to their national convention. On several occasions this court has \nrecognized that the inclusion of persons unaffiliated with the political party may seriously \ndistort its collective decisions, thus imparting the partyโs essential functions, and that \npolitical party may accordingly protect themselves from intrusion by those with adverse \npolitical principals.โ \n  The case herein is different from both the Smith and the Wisconsin case. In this \ncase, it is the National party rather than the State party which is engaging or threatening \nto engage in the conduct at issue. The discrimination is against all the voters of a state, \nrather than against persons due to race, gender, or national origin. The discrimination \nhere, unlike Wisconsin, is not due to the ideology of the voter, but because the state \n\nCase 8:07-cv-01552-RAL-MAP     Document 4     Filed 09/05/07     Page 7 of 10 PageID 54\nlegislature of that state enacted a law to conduct its primary election, where democratic \nnominating convention delegates would be selected, on a date other than the date selected \nby the National Party.  \n  The  National  Party  rules  permit  the  citizens  of  other  states  to  conduct  their \nprimaries prior to February 5, 2007, to wit: Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, and \nNevada. \n  The question herein, is therefore, whether Article II of the Constitution implicitly \ngives states the rights to determine how delegates to the national nominating convention \nare elected and whether the National Party must accept those delegates, unless the state \nlaws violate the partyโs right to free speech and political association. \n  The second question is whether the National Party must afford its members equal \nprotection pursuant to the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.  \n  While unimaginable today, assuming arguendo, that this case took place in the \n1940โs and the National Party rules provided that only white delegates could participate \nin the national nominating convention, would the argument that the National Party had an \nabsolute right to determine the manner  in  which the delegates to the national convention \nare chosen, be sustainable under the law?  If so, then this court should rule that regardless \nof Florida law, the National Party has the unfettered right to make rules as to how the \nnomination  of  its  presidential  candidate  is  selected.  If  not,  then  this  court  should \ndetermine whether the threatened actions of the National Party would violate the stateโs \nrights in determining the time and manner of its election of presidential electors and its \ncitizenโs Fourteenth Amendment rights to equal protection under the Constitution of the \nUnited States.  \n\nCase 8:07-cv-01552-RAL-MAP     Document 4     Filed 09/05/07     Page 8 of 10 PageID 55\nLastly, this court must determine, if the National Party may exclude the delegates \nelected as a result of Floridaโs presidential preference primary on January 29, 2008, does \nthe  State  party  have  the  authority  to  adopt  and  implement  an  alternative  party-run \ndelegate selection system, without running afoul of the laws of the State of Florida. \nFlorida statutes section 103.091 establishes the right and responsibilities of each political \nparty of the state. Florida statutes section 100.051 states that the Supervisor of Elections \nof each county shall print on ballots...the names of candidates who have been nominated \nby a political party. \n  The  action  of  the  National  Party  and  the  State  Party,  for  ballot  placement \npurposes, is as an agent for the state, and must not violate the rights and privileges of \ncitizens of the United States. \n  The Plaintiff is asking this court to determine whether it is unlawful for the State \nparty to select delegates, other than as set forth in the Florida statutes. If by agreement \nwith the National Party, the State party attempts to do so, would that violation of state \nlaw preclude the Democratic Party from placing the name of its candidate, nominated at \nthe Democratic Nominating Convention, on the state ballot in the general election? If so, \nit is of great importance that this court enters a declaratory judgment, well prior to the \nanticipated  January  29,  2008  presidential  preference  primary  election  in  Florida,  to \ndetermine the rights and obligations of the parties herein. \nCONCLUSION \n  Plaintiff posits that there are no material facts in dispute and that a ruling in this \ncase can be made as a matter of law. The Plaintiff requests that this court find that it has \njurisdiction and authority to enter a declaratory judgment to determine the rights and \n\nCase 8:07-cv-01552-RAL-MAP     Document 4     Filed 09/05/07     Page 9 of 10 PageID 56\nresponsibilities of the parties herein and that the issues are ripe. The Plaintiff further \nrequests that this court enter a declaratory judgment determining whether the National \nparty must accept and seat delegates elected by the State of Florida at its Presidential \npreference primary scheduled for January 29, 2008, regardless of National party rules and \ndecisions to the contrary.  \n              Respectfully Submitted, \n \n              s/ Michael A.

CASE NO: 8:07-cv-1552-T-26MAP\nDEMOCRATIC NATIONAL \nCOMMITTEE and FLORIDA \nDEMOCRATIC PARTY,\nDefendants.\n                                                                  /\nO R D E R\nThe Court has for its consideration Plaintiffโs motion for summary judgment and\nincorporated supporting memorandum of law.  After review, the Court concludes that the\nmotion is due to be denied for two reasons: the Court lacks personal jurisdiction over\nDefendants and, assuming the existence of such jurisdiction, the motion is premature.\nPlaintiff filed his complaint against Defendants on August 30, 2007, requesting a\ndeclaratory judgment under 28 U.S.C. ยง 2201.  He specifically seeks a judgment\ndeclaring that the recently announced policy of Defendant Democratic National\nCommittee not to seat delegates elected by voters of the State of Florida at the next\nDemocratic national convention violates his rights under Article II and the Fourteenth\nAmendment of the United States Constitution.  Although the clerk issued Plaintiff\n\nCase 8:07-cv-01552-RAL-MAP     Document 5     Filed 09/05/07     Page 2 of 3 PageID 59\nsummons to be served on Defendants the same day as the filing of the complaint, a review\nof the court file does not reflect service of process on either Defendant.\nPlaintiff, less than 20 days after he commenced this action, now moves for\nsummary judgment under the auspices of Rule 56(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil\nProcedure.1  He has forwarded copies of the motion through the United States mail\nservice to each Defendant in care of their respective chairpersons.  Plaintiffโs motion, as\nstated, is due to be summarily denied for two basic reasons.\nFirst, until such time as Plaintiff effects service of process on each Defendant, this\nCourt is without personal jurisdiction over them.  As the United States Supreme Court has\nobserved, โ[b]efore a federal court may exercise personal jurisdiction over a defendant,\nthe procedural requirement of service of summons must be satisfied.โ  Omni Capital Intโl\nv. Rudolf Wolff & Co., 484 U.S. 104, 108 S.Ct. 404, 409, 98 L.Ed.2d 415 (1987).  Mere\nnotice to a defendant is insufficient to satisfy the requirement of service of process and to\nbestow personal jurisdiction over that defendant.  Id.; accord Prewitt Enter., Inc. v.\nOrganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, 353 F.3d 916, 924-25 (11th Cir. 2003). \nConsequently, these Defendants are not obliged to engage in this litigation until such time\nas they are notified of this action by formal process brought under this Courtโs authority. \nSee Murphy Bros., Inc. v. Michetti Pipe Stringling, Inc., 526 U.S. 344, 347, 119 S.Ct.\n1322, 1325, 143 L.Ed.2d 448 (1999); accord Prewitt, 353 F.3d at 925.   \n1   Because Plaintiff is a party seeking to obtain a declaratory judgment, the proper\nrule designation should be Rule 56(a).\n-2-\n\nCase 8:07-cv-01552-RAL-MAP     Document 5     Filed 09/05/07     Page 3 of 3 PageID 60\nSecond, even assuming proper service of process on Defendants, Plaintiffโs motion\nis premature.  Rule 56(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure unambiguously provides\nin pertinent part that โ[a] party seeking . . . to obtain a declaratory judgment may, at any\ntime after the expiration of 20 days from the commencement of the action . . . move with\nor without supporting affidavits for a summary judgment in the partyโs favor upon all or\nany part thereof.โ  In this case, Plaintiff filed his motion six days after commencement of\nthe case in clear violation of the time constraints of the rule.\nACCORDINGLY, for the reasons expressed, it is ORDERED AND\nADJUDGED that Plaintiffโs Motion for Summary Judgment (Dkt. 4) is denied.\nDONE AND ORDERED at Tampa, Florida, on September 5, 2007.\n     s/Richard A.

As fully demonstrated below, and in the accompanying \nmemorandum and exhibits, Plaintiff is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law. \nPRELIMINARY STATEMENT: \nThis case involves the decision of the Democratic National Committee to disallow \nany delegates from the State of Florida to be seated or participate in the 2008 Democratic \nNominating  Convention,  because  the  State  of  Florida  enacted  a  law  designating  a \npresidential preference primary date (at which time it would be determined how many \ncommitted delegates a presidential candidate would be awarded) for a date earlier than \n  1\n\nCase 8:07-cv-01552-RAL-MAP     Document 13     Filed 09/26/07     Page 2 of 13 PageID 94\nthe rules of the Democratic National Committee permitted. Attached hereto is a copy of a \nletter from the DNC to the FDP containing said decision. This letter is marked exhibit \nโAโ and made a part hereof by reference. \nThe  Plaintiff  is  a  registered  Democrat  and  resident  of  Hillsborough  County \nFlorida, who believes that this action of the Democratic National Committee may be \nunconstitutional in that it violates his rights, and the rights of other Democratic voters in \nthe State of Florida, to equal protection under the 14th amendment to the United States \nConstitution.  \nI.     Do actions of DNC constitute โstate actionโ? \nPlaintiff agrees with the Defendant, Democratic National Committee (hereinafter \nDNC) that the first step in deciding whether the action of the DNC violates the Plaintiffโs \nconstitutional rights is to determine whether the actions of the party constitute โstate \nactionโ.  In order to succeed in a claim that a Defendant violated a Plaintiffโs right under \nthe 14th amendment, the conduct must constitute state action NCAA v. Tarkanian, 488 \nU.S. 179, 182 (1985).   \nIn  the  case  of  Smith  v.  Allwright,  321  U.S.  649  (1944),  Petitioner  was  an \nindividual voter, who was denied the right to vote in a primary election conducted by a \npolitical party. The political party adopted a rule that all white citizens of the State of \nTexasโฆ shall be eligible for membership in the Democratic party, and, as such, entitled \nto participate in its deliberations.  As a result of that rule, Petitioner, a negro, was not \npermitted to vote in the primary election conducted by the party. \nAs  in  this  case,  the  party  argued  that  the  Democratic  party  of  Texas  was  a \nvoluntary organization and free to select its own membership and to limit to whites, \n  2\n\nCase 8:07-cv-01552-RAL-MAP     Document 13     Filed 09/26/07     Page 3 of 13 PageID 95\nparticipation in the party primary.  They further asserted that the 14th amendment only \napplied to general elections and that primaries are political affairs handled by party, not \ngovernmental officers. \nThe Supreme Court reaffirmed that section 4 of article 1, of the Constitution \nauthorized Congress to regulate primaries, as well as general elections U.S. v. Classic  \n313 U.S. 299 at 316, 317. The court went on to state โthe question as to whether the \nexclusionary action of the party was the action of the state persists as the determinative \nfactorโ. \nThe court concluded that while membership in party was of no concern to the \nstate,  when  that  privilege  was  also  the  essential  qualification  for  voting  to  select \nnominees for a general election, the state makes the action of the party, the action of the \nstate.   \nIn Terry v. Adams, 345 U.S. 461 (1953), petitioners, qualified negro voters of a \nTexas county, sued to determine the legality of their being excluded, solely because of \ntheir race and color, from voting in elections held by an association consisting of all \nqualified white voters in the county.  In that case, the associationโs elections, as in the \ncase at bar, were not governed by state laws.  The District Court issued a declaratory \njudgment holding invalid racial discrimination in a pre-primary election. \nIn the case of Georgia v. National Democratic Party, 447 F. 2d 1271 (D.C. Cir. \n1971) the Court found state action in the formulas the national parties used to allocate \ndelegates to a national nominating convention.  The court concluded that by placing the \nnominee of the convention on the ballot, the states โhave adopted this narrowing process \nas a necessary adjunct of their election proceduresโ Id. at 1276. \n  3\n\nCase 8:07-cv-01552-RAL-MAP     Document 13     Filed 09/26/07     Page 4 of 13 PageID 96\nIn the case of Bode v. National Democratic Party, 452 F. 2d. 1304 (D.C. Cir. \n1972), the same court held that the DNCโs adoption of a formula for the allocation of \ndelegates to its 1972 National Convention was โtantamount to a decision of the states \nacting in concert and therefore subject to constitutional standards, applicable to state \nactionโ. \nHowever, in Brown v. OโBrien, 469 F.2d 563 (D.C. Cir. 1972), when the Circuit \nCourt  for  the  District  of  Columbia  found  that  a  delegate  seating  decision  by  the \nCredentials Committee constituted state action, and that the actions against the State of \nCalifornia  were  unconstitutional,  the  Supreme  Court  stayed  the  order.    While  the \nSupreme Court did not decide the issue, it found that there was a highly important \nquestion to be answered to wit: โWhether the action of the Credentials Committee was \nstate actionโ.  In this case, the court stated โthis is not a case in which claims are made \nthat injury arises from invidious discrimination based on race in a primary contest within \na single stateโ.   \nIn the case of Cousins v. Wigoda, 419 U.S. 477 (1975) the court held that an \nIllinois court had unconstitutionally attempted to enjoin delegates selected pursuant to \nDemocratic Party rules from taking their seats at the 1972 National Convention.  Because \nthe case arose in the context of a state court injunction, the court found state action was \nclear and it was not necessary to determine whether the decisions of a national party in \nthe area of delegate selection constitutes state or governmental action 419 U.S. 483.   \nIn Ripon Society v. National Republican Party, 525 F.2nd 567 (D.C. Cir. 1975) the \ncourt pointed out โthe nexus between the states and the delegate allocation formula is \nopen to question, since the Supreme Court in Cousins v. Wigoda, 419 U.S. 477 (1975) \n  4\n\nCase 8:07-cv-01552-RAL-MAP     Document 13     Filed 09/26/07     Page 5 of 13 PageID 97\nheld that an individual state is without power to interfere with the delegate selection \nprocedures of a National Convention. The court concluded that since the case failed on its \nmerits, they declined to decide the state action question Id. at 576. \nBut in Morse v. Republican Party of Virginia, 517 U.S. 186 (1996), the Supreme \nCourt stated the party was the โstateโ for purpose of the Voting Rights Act.  Justice \nStevens pointed out that the State of Virginia reserved the top two positions for the major \nparties to fill with their nominees, thus delegating to the parties the power to determine \npart of the field of candidates from which the voters must choose. \nThe Supreme Courtโs holding in Morse, however, only addresses whether the \nVirginia Republican Partyโs action were those of a state or political subdivision under the \nVoting Rights Act, and not whether those of a state under the Constitution.  \nFlorida Statute 101.2512 states โthe supervisor of elections of each county shall \nprint on ballots to be used in the county at the next general election, the names of \ncandidates who have been nominated by a political party and the candidates who have \notherwise obtained a position on the general  election  ballot  in  compliance  with  the \nrequirements of this codeโ.  The State of Florida has given the candidate that emerges \nfrom the Democratic Nominating Convention preference in access to the stateโs general \nelection ballots.  In Mrazek v. Suffolk County Board of Elections, 630 F.2d 840, 894 (2d \nCir.  1980),  the  court  suggested  that  nominating  procedures  must  conform  to \nconstitutional requirements, because ensured access to the ballot may constitute a form of \nstate action.   \nFurthermore, Title 26 U.S.C. 9008(b) provides that the National Committee of a \nmajor  party  shall  be  entitled  to  payments  to  conduct  its  Presidential  nominating \n  5\n\nCase 8:07-cv-01552-RAL-MAP     Document 13     Filed 09/26/07     Page 6 of 13 PageID 98\nconvention in amounts up to 4 million dollars.  By accepting federal funds, the DNC is \ninextricably intertwined with the United States Government and clearly the nominating \nconvention is state action for purposes of selecting a candidate for President. \n \nII.     Assuming โstate actionโ will Plaintiffโs 14th amendment \nrights be violated? \n \nAssuming,  arguendo,  state  action,  the  next  matter  to  resolve  is  whether  the \nDefendant, DNC, is required to accept the results of the Florida Presidential Preference \nPrimary election on January 29, 2008, and assign to presidential candidates, entitlement \nto  committed  delegates,  based  on  the  percentage  of  votes  each  candidate  receives \n(provided the percentage reaches a certain threshold).   \nIn the case of Cousins v. Wigoda, 419 U.S. 477 (1975), delegates had been \nelected in the state-run Illinois primary as delegates to the 1972 Democratic Nominating \nConvention, but another group of delegates (Cousins) chosen at caucuses, successfully \nchallenged the seating of the Wigoda delegates before the Credentials Committee. \nThe Supreme Court held that the DNC enjoyed a constitutionally protected right \nof political association and that Illinoisโ  interest in ensuring that its primary results were \nhonored,  cannot  be  deemed  compelling  in  the  context  of  selecting  delegates  to  the \nNational Party Convention, Id at 491. \nIn Wisconsin v. DNC, 450 U.S. 107 (1981), the Supreme Court held that a state \nmay not compel the National Party to seat a delegation chosen in a way that violates the \nrules of the party.  It must be noted, however, in Cousins and in Wisconsin, the court \nbased its decision on the DNCโs constitutional rights of association and free speech.  In \n  6\n\nCase 8:07-cv-01552-RAL-MAP     Document 13     Filed 09/26/07     Page 7 of 13 PageID 99\nboth  cases,  the  issue  was  not  which  presidential  candidate  would  be  entitled  to  be \nassigned what percentage of committed delegates, but whether the National Party had the \nright to exclude delegates who were chosen in such a way so as to violate party rules with \nrespect to the selection of delegates. \nIn the case herein, the DNCโs qualm is not with respect to the voters who elect the \ndelegates  (as  in  Wisconsin)  or  in  the  demographic  makeup  of  the  delegates  (as  in \nCousins), but with the timing of the Presidential Preference Primary, at which time it \nwould be decided what percentage of the committed delegates would be assigned to the \npresidential candidates. \nThe Plaintiff posits that the actions of the state, in scheduling its Presidential \nPreference Primary on January 29, 2008, in no way violates any constitutional right of the \nparty to association or speech. \nIn Ripon Society v. National Republican Party, 525 F.2d 567 (D.C. Cir. 1975) the \nDC Circuit Court found that the Plaintiffโs Equal protection interest in the delegate \nselection rules of a political party was โoffset by the 1st Amendment rights exercised by \nthe party in choosing the delegate allocation formula that it didโ.  They concluded that \neven if the party were a state actor, the constitution was satisfied if the party rules \nrationally  advanced  some  legitimate  interest  of  the  party  in  winning  elections  or \notherwise achieving its political goals.   \nIn this case, there are no racial, gender, or national origin classifications as in the \nwhite primary cases, but likewise, there are no 1st amendment rights of the party at issue \neither.  Instead, there is disparity in the rules governing the date an election may be held \nin some states versus other states.  Clearly, there is unequal treatment of the electorate of \n  7\n\nCase 8:07-cv-01552-RAL-MAP     Document 13     Filed 09/26/07     Page 8 of 13 PageID 100\nthe various states.  The question to be resolved then, is what level of scrutiny is to be \napplied in this situation in determining whether the actions of the National Party violate \nthe Plaintiffโs 14th amendment rights. \nThe  Plaintiff  posits  that  the  National  Party  derives  its  privilege  to  have  its \nnominee  placed  on  the  Florida  ballot,  from  Florida  Law.    Florida  Statute  101.2512 \nprovides that the supervisor of elections shall print on the general election ballot the \nnames of candidates nominated by primary election โฆ pursuant to the requirements of \nthis code.  The key phrase in this statute is โpursuant to the requirements of this codeโ.  If \nthe National Party does not comply with state law in the nomination of its presidential \ncandidate, the party loses its privilege to have the name of its candidate placed on the \ngeneral election ballot.  Of course, the candidate could otherwise qualify to appear on the \nballot or run as a write-in candidate, but for all practical purposes, unless the candidate is \nentitled  to  placement  on  the  ballot  as  the  nominee  of  a  political  party,  it  greatly \ndiminishes his or her ability to win the electoral votes for the state. \nThe Plaintiff posits that if by enforcing Florida Law, the state would violate the \nconstitutional rights of the National Party, the State of Florida may not exclude the \nNational  Partyโs  nominee  from  the  ballot,  as  long  as  the  National  Party  otherwise \ncomplied with Florida Law.  On the other hand, if the National Party violates the Equal \nProtection Rights of citizens of the State of Florida, and does not recognize the allocation \nof committed delegates resulting from the Presidential Preference Primary election, the \nstate is within its rights to exclude the Defendantโs nominee from it ballot.   \nThe  Plaintiff  further  posits  that  the  National  Party,  through  its  executive \ncommittee, is without authority to engage in such conduct so as to deprive its members of \n  8\n\nCase 8:07-cv-01552-RAL-MAP     Document 13     Filed 09/26/07     Page 9 of 13 PageID 101\nequal protection under the 14th amendment and that a member has the right to bring a \nโderivativeโ action where the conduct of the executive committee constitutes malfeasance \nand breach of fiduciary duty so as to seriously jeopardize the chance of any nominee \nselected at the National Convention, of being elected president.   \nIII.  If the DNC did not violate Plaintiffโs 14th amendment rights, \nwhat is the duty of the State Party? \n \nPlaintiff  posits  that  the  State  Party,  as  an  agent  of  the  National  Party  and \nrepresentative of the Plaintiff, has a fiduciary duty to ensure compliance with National \nParty rules, if said rules would not result in a violation of the Plaintiffโs constitutional \nrights,  and  would  not  disqualify  the  eventual  party  nominee  from  appearing  on  the \ngeneral election ballot.   \nIf this court finds that the National Party is within its rights to strip Florida of all \nof its delegates to the National Nominating Convention, unless it conducts an alternate \ndelegate selection system, which is in compliance with national rules, but that by doing \nso, this action would result in the eventual nomineeโs name not appearing on the general \nelection ballot, as the Partyโs candidate, the Defendant state party is in a precarious \nposition.  On the one hand, its inaction will result in the state not being represented at the \nDemocratic Nominating Convention, but on the other hand, its compliance with the \nNational Party would result in the partyโs nominee almost certainly not winning the \nelectoral votes from Florida in the general election, due to its candidateโs name not \nappearing on the ballot as the partyโs candidate. \nBut if the court finds that the National Party is within its right to strip Florida of \nits  delegates  due  to  the  scheduling  of  its  Presidential  Preference  Primary  prior  to \n  9\n\nCase 8:07-cv-01552-RAL-MAP     Document 13     Filed 09/26/07     Page 10 of 13 PageID 102\nFebruary 5, 2008, and that Florida may not refuse to place the name of the Defendantโs \nnominee on its ballot, even though it would have conducted a delegate selection process \ndifferently than as set forth in the Florida Statutes, then Defendant, State Democratic \nParty, would be breaching its duty to Plaintiff and to the DNC, by not conducting an \nalternative delegate selection process in compliance with National Party rules. \nIV.                            STANDING \nThe Plaintiff contends that this court has standing to enter a declaratory judgment \npursuant to 28 U.S.C. 2201, which provides in part, that โin a case of actual controversy \nwithin its jurisdiction... any court of the United States, upon the filing of an appropriate \npleading, may declare the rights and other relations of any interested party seeking such \ndeclaration, whether or not, further relief is or could be sought. Any such declaration \nshall have the force and effect of a final judgment or decree and shall be reviewable as \nsuch.โ  Article III section 2 of the United States Constitution grants jurisdiction to this \ncourt of cases arising under the United States Constitution.  \nArticle  III  standing  requires  a  party  to  show  actual  injury,  a  causal  relation \nbetween that injury and the challenged conduct, and the likelihood that a favorable \ndecision by the court will redress the alleged injury Lugan v. Defenders of Wildlife 504 \nU.S. 555, 560-61 (1992.) \nWhen government action or inaction is challenged by a party who is a target or \nobject of that action, as in this case, โthere is ordinarily little question that the action or \ninaction has caused him injury and that a judgment preventing or requiring the action will \nredress itโ Lugan, 504 U.S. at 561. \n  10\n\nCase 8:07-cv-01552-RAL-MAP     Document 13     Filed 09/26/07     Page 11 of 13 PageID 103\nIn the case of Cousins v. Wigoda 419 U.S. 477 (1975), following a primary, \nCousins brought a declaratory judgment action seeking a ruling that he was duly elected \nto the Democratic Nominating Convention in accordance with Illinois law and sought an \ninjunction  against  Respondent  to  prohibit  them  from  interfering  or  impeding  the \nfunctioning of the Petitioner  a duly elected delegate. In that case, the District Court \nassumed jurisdiction. \n  In the case of Terry v. Adams 345 U.S. 461 (1953), Plaintiffs were Blacks who \ninstituted an action against a political party in district court for declaratory and injunctive \nrelief.  The district court assumed jurisdiction and entered an order declaring Plaintiffs \nwere legally entitled to vote in the partyโs primary election.   \nThe Plaintiff herein is not seeking a mere advisory opinion.  He has clearly shown \na โsubstantial continuing controversy between parties having adverse legal interest and \nthat the controversy is real and immediate. \n  As of the date of this pleading, Plaintiff is faced with the threat that his vote in the \nPresident Preference Primary election will not count in the nomination process.  It is \ndisingenuous for the DNC to assert that Plaintiff is not being deprived of his right to vote \nin a meaningful way.  What Plaintiff is clearly asserting is that he does not know who is \ndepriving him of a right to a meaningful vote, the National Party or the State party. \nCONCLUSION \nPlaintiff posits that there are no material facts in dispute and that a ruling in this \ncase can be made as a matter of law.  The Plaintiff requests that this court find that it has \njurisdiction and authority to enter a declaratory judgment to determine the rights and \nresponsibilities of the parties herein, and that the issues are ripe.

The Court is also of the view that allowing Plaintiff to\namend to cure the deficiencies of his complaint would be an exercise in futility. \n1   See dockets 1, 10, 11, and 13.\n\nCase 8:07-cv-01552-RAL-MAP     Document 18     Filed 10/05/07     Page 2 of 13 PageID 117\nConsequently, the Court will dismiss the case with prejudice and direct the Clerk to enter\njudgment for Defendants.\nBACKGROUND\nThis is an action for declaratory relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยงยง 1331, 1343, and\n2201.  Plaintiff Victor DiMaio (โDiMaioโ) is a citizen of Hillsborough County, Florida,\nand a registered Democrat.  Defendant Democratic National Committee (โDNCโ) is the\nofficial representative entity of the Democratic Party which is responsible for\npromulgating the Delegate Selection Rules for the 2008 Democratic National Convention\n(โthe Rulesโ).2  Defendant Florida Democratic Party (โFDPโ) is the official representative\nentity of the Democratic Party in the State of Florida which is responsible for ensuring\ncompliance with the Rules of the DNC regarding the delegate selection process for the\n2008 Democratic National Convention (โthe Conventionโ). \nThe Rules of the DNC provide that no state presidential preference primary\nelection may be held prior to the first Tuesday in February or after the second Tuesday in\nJune, in the calendar year of the Convention, except for the states of New Hampshire,\nIowa, Nevada, and South Carolina.3  The Rules further provide that the DNC may impose\nsanctions for violations by a state of these rules, including the reduction or elimination of\nthe number of delegates to the Convention.4  \n2   See docket 1, Exhibit A.\n3   See docket 1, Exhibit A, Rule 11(A).\n4   See docket 1, Exhibit A, Rule 20(C)(1)(a) and (C)(5) and (6). \n-2-\n\nCase 8:07-cv-01552-RAL-MAP     Document 18     Filed 10/05/07     Page 3 of 13 PageID 118\nIn 2007, the Florida legislature amended section 103.101(a) of the Florida Statutes\nto advance the presidential preference primary from the second Tuesday in March to the\nlast Tuesday in January.  The amendment now mandates that โ[e]ach political party other\nthan a minor political party shall, on the last Tuesday in January in each year the number\nof which is a multiple of 4, elect one person to be the candidate for nomination of such\nparty for President of the United States or select delegates to the national nominating\nconvention, as provided by party rule.โ  On or about August 25, 2007, according to\nDiMaioโs complaint, the DNCโs Rules and Bylaws Committee voted not to allow the\nState of Florida to seat delegates at the Convention because of the enactment of the\namendment moving the State primary to a date which violates the Rules, unless within 30\ndays the FDP moves its primary back at least seven days from the current January 29,\n2008 date.5  \nARGUMENTS\nDiMaio argues that by refusing to recognize the results of the State of Floridaโs\npresidential primary election, held in accord with section 103.101(a), and by refusing to\nseat the Florida delegation so elected, the DNC may or may not violate his rights under\nArticle II and the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment to the United States\nConstitution.  DiMaio further asserts that the FDP has an obligation to its members in the\nState of Florida to ensure that they are represented at the Convention and are allowed to\n5   See docket 1, paragraph 9.\n-3-\n\nCase 8:07-cv-01552-RAL-MAP     Document 18     Filed 10/05/07     Page 4 of 13 PageID 119\nparticipate in selecting the Democratic nominee for United States President.  DiMaio\nfurther posits that if the decision of the DNC does in fact violate his constitutional rights,\nit would be appropriate for this Court to make a finding to that effect.  In the alternative,\nand if the Court finds that the decision of the DNC does not violate his constitutional\nrights, DiMaio requests that the Court determine whether the FDP must implement an\nalternative party-run delegate selection system which neither conflicts with the DNC rules\nnor runs afoul of the laws of the State of Florida. \nThe DNC and the FDP, in turn, seek an order dismissing the complaint pursuant to\nRule 12(b)(1), Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, based on DiMaioโs lack of standing\nunder Article III of the Constitution,6 as well as lack of subject matter jurisdiction. They\nalso contend, in reliance on Rule 12(b)(6), Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, that DiMaio\nhas wholly failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.  As noted, after\ncarefully reviewing the partiesโ submissions, the Court determines that DiMaioโs\ncomplaint is due to be dismissed with prejudice.\n6   This constitutional provision limits the jurisdiction of the federal courts to actual\ncases or controversies between enumerated entities.  \n-4-\n\nCase 8:07-cv-01552-RAL-MAP     Document 18     Filed 10/05/07     Page 5 of 13 PageID 120\nANALYSIS \nIn the words of the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals, โ[s]tanding is a threshold\njurisdictional question which must be addressed prior to and independent of the merits of\na partyโs claims.โ  Dillard v. Baldwin County Commโrs, 225 F.3d 1271, 1275 (11th Cir.\n2000).  As the Eleventh Circuit has further explained, it is a doctrine that stems directly\nfrom Article IIIโs case or controversy requirement and implicates a courtโs subject matter\njurisdiction to such a critical extent that without standing a court is powerless to act.  See,\ne.g., Bochese v. Town of Ponce Inlet, 405 F.3d 964, 975-76 (11th Cir. 2005).  \nIn Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560-61, 112 S.Ct. 2130, 2136,\n119 L.Ed.2d 351 (1992), the Supreme Court, speaking through Justice Scalia,\nsummarized its prior precedent in terms of what a plaintiff must establish at an irreducible\nconstitutional minimum to enjoy standing under Article III.  First, a plaintiff must have\nsuffered an injury in fact which translates into an invasion of a legally protected interest\nwhich is concrete and particularized and actual or imminent as opposed to conjectural or\nhypothetical.  Second, there must be a causal connection between the injury of which the\nplaintiff complains and the conduct of the defendant such that plaintiffโs injury is fairly\ntraceable to the challenged acts of the defendant and not the independent acts of a third\nparty not before the court.  Third, it must be likely, as opposed to merely speculative, that\nplaintiffโs injury will be redressed by a favorable decision from the court.  The fact that a\nplaintiff, such as DiMaio, invokes the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. ยง 2201, in\nsupport of relief from a court does not relieve him of the burden of satisfying the\n-5-\n\nCase 8:07-cv-01552-RAL-MAP     Document 18     Filed 10/05/07     Page 6 of 13 PageID 121\nconstitutional prerequisites for standing.  See Emory v. Peeler, 756 F.2d 1547, 1552 (11th\nCir. 1985).  Indeed, as noted by the court in Emory, ยง 2201(a) echoes the case or\ncontroversy requirement of Article III and provides that a declaratory judgment may only\nbe issued by a federal court โ[i]n a case of actual controversy within its jurisdiction . . .โ \nId. (citing ยง 2201).\nMeasured against these legal standards, DiMaio wholly fails to satisfy the\nconstitutional criteria for standing under Article III with regard to the first element.  His\ncomplaint does not assert any actual or real controversy with the DNC or the FDP. \nDiMaio โpositsโ that by imposing sanctions on the FDP, the DNC โmay be violating his\nrights under Article II and the 14th Amendment.โ7  Similarly, he alleges that\nimplementation of the DNCโs Rules โmay or may not violate Plaintiffโs right to vote in a\nPresidential primary election ....โ8  DiMaio concludes by suggesting that, โif the decision\nof the National Party violates the Plaintiffโs constitutional rights, it would be appropriate\nfor this court to make such a finding.โ9  These allegations amount to nothing more than\nsheer speculation on the part of DiMaio that his constitutional rights are being violated. \nConsequently, he is merely asking the Court for an advisory opinion with respect to the \nactions and obligations of the DNC and the FDP.  It is well-established, however, that\nโ[t]he federal courts established pursuant to Article III of the Constitution do not render\n7   See docket 1, paragraph 10 (emphasis added).\n8   See docket 1, paragraph 13 (emphasis added).\n9   See docket 1, paragraph 14 (emphasis added).\n-6-\n\nCase 8:07-cv-01552-RAL-MAP     Document 18     Filed 10/05/07     Page 7 of 13 PageID 122\nadvisory opinions.  For adjudication of constitutional issues, concrete legal issues,\npresented in actual cases, not abstractions, are requisite.  This is as true of declaratory\njudgments as any other field.โ  United Public Workers of America v. Mitchell, 330 U.S.\n75, 89, 67 S.Ct. 556, 564, 91 L.Ed. 754 (1947).  The Court concludes, therefore, that\nbecause DiMaio has no standing to bring this lawsuit, the Court lacks subject matter\njurisdiction and is powerless to act.  See Bochese, 405 F.3d at 974 (observing that\nstanding is perhaps the most important jurisdictional doctrine and as with any\njurisdictional requisite we are powerless to hear a case when it is lacking).\nEven if DiMaio was able to make the requisite showing for standing, his complaint\nfails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.  In determining whether to grant a\n12(b)(6) motion, a court should not dismiss a complaint if it includes โenough facts to\nstate a claim for relief that is plausible on its face.โ  Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 127\nS.Ct. 1955, 1974 (2007) (dismissing complaint because plaintiffs had not โnudged their\nclaims across the line from conceivable to plausibleโ).  In making this determination, a\ncourt takes the well-pled facts of the complaint as true and construes the facts favorably\nto the plaintiff.  See 5A Charles A.Wright & Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice and\nProcedure ยง 1368 (1990).  While a complaint attacked by a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to\ndismiss does not need detailed factual allegations, โa plaintiff's obligation to provide the\n'grounds' of his 'entitlement to relief' requires more than labels and conclusions, and a\nformulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do.\"  Twombly, 127 S.\nCt. at 1964-65.  To survive a motion to dismiss under Twombly, a complaintโs factual\n-7-\n\nCase 8:07-cv-01552-RAL-MAP     Document 18     Filed 10/05/07     Page 8 of 13 PageID 123\nallegations, if assumed to be true, โmust be enough to raise the right to relief above the\nspeculative level.โ  Id. at 1965. \nAs previously stated, DiMaio argues that the actions of the DNC may be violating\nhis rights under Article II of the United States Constitution.  However, no provision of\nthat Article confers any actionable right on any individual voter.  Instead, Article II\ndirects state legislatures to determine the manner in which electors for the offices of\nPresident and Vice President shall be appointed and provides the manner in which those\nelectors shall perform their duties.  See U.S. Const. Art. II, ยง 1, cl. 2. \nDiMaio next argues that the DNC may be violating his equal protection rights\nunder the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution.  To that end, he\ninvokes the provisions of 28 U.S.C. ยง 1343.  Section 1343 is the jurisdictional counterpart\nto claims brought under the nationโs federal civil rights laws.  See Lynch v. Household\nFinance Corp., 405 U.S. 538, 92 S.Ct. 1113, 31 L.Ed.2d 424 (1972).  It authorizes private\ncivil actions to โredress the deprivation, under color of any State law, statute, ordinance,\nregulation, custom, or usage, of any right, privilege or immunity secured by the\nConstitution of the United States or by an Act of Congress providing for equal rights of\ncitizens or of all persons within the jurisdiction of the United States.โ  28 U.S.C.\nยง 1343(3) (emphasis added).  Therefore, ยง 1343(3) grants to the federal courts jurisdiction\nto hear only those โclaims alleging official state deprivation of constitutional rights.โ \nFountain v. Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Auth., 678 F.2d 1038, 1042 n. 7 (11th\nCir. 1982) (emphasis added).\n-8-\n\nCase 8:07-cv-01552-RAL-MAP     Document 18     Filed 10/05/07     Page 9 of 13 PageID 124\nIn this case, DiMaio fails to state a cause of action because the DNC and the FDP\ndo not exercise any power conferred or delegated by the State of Florida; rather, they are\nprivate actors.  As the DNC and FDP correctly argue, the State of Florida plays no role at\nall in the allocation or selection of delegates to the Convention.  DiMaio himself even\nalleges that the FDP remains free to run its own private, alternative process for allocating\nand selecting delegates and, if that process complies with the DNCโs rules, the FDP will\nbe able to send a full delegation to the Convention.10  The DNC, in enforcing its delegate\nselection rules, is simply refusing to recognize the results of that primary in the allocation\nof delegates to the Convention.  This does not amount to state action.\nFinally, even if DiMaio could somehow overcome the standing and state action\nrequirements, the Supreme Court has consistently recognized that national political\nparties have a constitutionally protected right to manage and conduct their own internal\naffairs, including the enforcement of delegate selection rules and the decision as to which\nstate delegates it will recognize, under the First Amendmentโs right to freedom of\nassociation, and that associational right generally prevails over any countervailing state\ninterest or the interest of any individual voter.  See California Democratic Party v. Jones,\n530 U.S. 567, 120 S.Ct. 2402, 147 L.Ed.2d 502 (2000); Tashjian v. Republican Party of\nConnecticut, 479 U.S. 208, 107 S.Ct. 544, 93 L.Ed.2d 514 (1986); Democratic Party of\nthe United States v. Wisconsin ex rel. LaFollette, 450 U.S. 107, 101 S.Ct. 1010, 67\n10   See docket 1, paragraph 13.\n-9-\n\nCase 8:07-cv-01552-RAL-MAP     Document 18     Filed 10/05/07     Page 10 of 13 PageID 125\nL.Ed.2d 82 (1981); Cousins v. Wigoda, 419 U.S. 477, 95 S.Ct. 541, 42 L.Ed.2d 595\n(1975).   In LaFollette, for example, the Supreme Court specifically stressed that โa State,\nor a court, may not constitutionally substitute its own judgment for that of the Party.  A\npolitical partyโs choice among the various ways of determining the makeup of a Stateโs\ndelegation to the partyโs national convention is protected by the Constitution.โ  450 U.S.\nat 123-24, 101 S.Ct. at 1020 (footnote omitted).  The Court in LaFollette also observed\nthat a state must demonstrate a โcompellingโ interest to warrant interference with the\npartyโs constitutionally-protected associational rights and that the State of Wisconsin had\nnot met its burden of establishing such a compelling state interest.  450 U.S. at 126, 101\nS.Ct. at 1021.  Therefore, in the absence of a compelling state interest, which in this case\nDiMaio has not even alleged, the Court cannot require Florida delegates to the\nConvention to vote there in accordance with the primary results where the primary\nviolates the DNCโs rules.  In the Courtโs view, and in light of the cited Supreme Court\ndecisions, the DNC can insist that the FDP choose delegates through a method that\ncomplies with DNC Rules or else not send any delegates to the Convention at all.  \nFurthermore, DiMaio, as an individual voter, has no more right than the State of\nFlorida itself to compel the DNC to seat delegates in violation of its own Rules.  See\nBachur v. Democratic Natโl Party, 836 F.2d 837, 841-42 (4th Cir. 1987) (determining that\nthe voterโs right to vote for delegates was outweighed by the โbroad, encompassing First\nand Fourteenth Amendment protection enjoyed by the National Partyโ in the\nestablishment of delegate selection rules).  Besides, DiMaio makes no allegation that he\n-10-\n\nCase 8:07-cv-01552-RAL-MAP     Document 18     Filed 10/05/07     Page 11 of 13 PageID 126\nwill not be permitted to vote.  The State of Florida will hold its presidential primary on\nJanuary 29, 2008, and he will be entirely free to vote in that primary for the Democratic\npresidential candidate of his choice.  \nAlthough DiMaio relies upon the Supreme Courtโs holdings in Smith v. Allwright,\n321 U.S. 649, 64 S.Ct. 757, 88 L.Ed. 987 (1944) and Terry v. Adams, 345 U.S. 461, 73\nS.Ct. 809, 97 L.Ed. 1152 (1953), in asking the Court to declare the DNCโs actions\nunconstitutional, his reliance is misplaced.  The factual issues and questions of law\npresented in this case are clearly distinguishable from those cases.  Smith and Terry\ninvolved claims that the rules of two Democratic parties in the State of Texas, which were\nprescribed by the State, were racially discriminatory because they excluded blacks from\neven voting in the partyโs primaries and thus violated the Fifteenth Amendment.11 \nDiMaio, on the other hand, fails to allege that he will be barred from voting based on his\nrace or color and, furthermore, fails to demonstrate any state action.  Instead, his\ncomplaint merely sets out a speculative claim of unequal treatment based upon the DNCโs\nrefusal to recognize the results of Floridaโs primary election and refusal to seat the Florida\ndelegation.\nIn closing, the Court would echo the words of the Supreme Court that this is a case\nin which the Convention, and not a court, is the proper forum for determining this intra-\n11   Section 1 of the Fifteenth Amendment provides that โ[t]he right of citizens of\nthe United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any\nState on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude.โ  Section 2 confers on\nCongress the โpower to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.โ\n-11-\n\nCase 8:07-cv-01552-RAL-MAP     Document 18     Filed 10/05/07     Page 12 of 13 PageID 127\nparty dispute with regard to the seating of the State of Floridaโs delegates.  See Cousins,\n419 U.S. at 491, 95 S.Ct. at 549 (citing OโBrien v. Brown, 409 U.S. 1,4, 92 S.Ct. 2718,\n2720, 34 L.Ed. 2d 1 (1972)).  In the Courtโs view, and in light of the specific allegations\nof DiMaioโs complaint measured against controlling Supreme Court precedent, it is a\nmatter of foregone conclusion that this Court is not the appropriate entity to decide\nwhether the Florida delegation to the Convention should be seated in the event the State\nof Florida proceeds to hold its presidential primary on the date specified in section\n103.101(a).  See Wymbs v. Republican State Executive Comm. of Florida, 719 F.2d\n1072, 1082 (11th Cir. 1983).12\n12   The Court is aware as a matter of public knowledge that another lawsuit was\njust filed in the Northern District of Florida challenging the DNCโs decision not to seat\nFlorida delegates to the Convention selected in compliance with section 103.101(a).  The\nCourt emphasizes that its decision in this case is framed only by the allegations of\nDiMaioโs complaint.\n-12-\n\nCase 8:07-cv-01552-RAL-MAP     Document 18     Filed 10/05/07     Page 13 of 13 PageID 128\nACCORDINGLY, it is ORDERED AND ADJUDGED as follows:\n1) Defendantsโ Motions to Dismiss the Complaint (Dkts. 10 & 11) are granted. \n2) This case is dismissed with prejudice.\n3)       The clerk is directed to enter judgment in favor of Defendants, terminate any\npending motions/deadlines, and to CLOSE this case.\nDONE AND ORDERED at Tampa, Florida, on October 5, 2007.\n     s/Richard A.

Vizza, Deputy Clerk\nCopies furnished to:\nCounsel of Record\nUnrepresented Parties\n\nCase 8:07-cv-01552-RAL-MAP     Document 19     Filed 10/09/07     Page 2 of 2 PageID 130\nCIVIL APPEALS JURISDICTION CHECKLIST\n1. Appealable Orders: Courts of Appeals have jurisdiction conferred and strictly limited by statute:\n(a) Appeals from final orders pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Section 1291: Only final orders and judgments of district courts, or final orders of bankruptcy\ncourts which have been appealed to and fully resolved by a district court under 28 U.S.C. Section 158, generally are appealable.  A final decision\nis one that โends the litigation on the merits and leaves nothing for the court to do but execute the judgment.โ  Pitney Bowes, Inc. V. Mestre, 701\nF.2d 1365, 1368 (11th Cir. 1983).  A magistrate judgeโs report and recommendation is not final and appealable until judgment thereon is entered\nby a district court judge. 28 U.S.C. Section 636(c).\n(b) In cases involving multiple parties or multiple claims, a judgment as to fewer than all parties or all claims is not a final, appealable decision\nunless the district court has certified the judgment for immediate review under Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b), Williams v. Bishop, 732 F.2d 885, 885-86\n(11th Cir. 1984).  A judgment which resolves all issues except matters, such as attorneysโ fees and costs, that are collateral to the merits, is\nimmediately appealable. Budinich v. Becton Dickinson & Co., 486 U.S. 196, 201, 108 S. Ct. 1717, 1721-22, 100 L.Ed.2d 178 (1988); LaChance\nv. Duffyโs Draft House, Inc., 146 F.3d 832, 837 (11th Cir. 1998).\n(c) Appeals pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Section 1292(a):  Appeals are permitted from orders โgranting, continuing, modifying, refusing or dissolving\ninjunctions or refusing to dissolve or modify injunctions...โ and from โ[i]nterlocutory decrees...determining the rights and liabilities of parties\nto admiralty cases in which appeals from final decrees are allowed.โ  Interlocutory appeals from orders denying temporary restraining orders are\nnot permitted.\n(d) Appeals pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Section 1292(b) and Fed.R.App.P.5:  The certification specified in 28 U.S.C. Section 1292(b) must be obtained\nbefore a petition for permission to appeal is filed in the Court of Appeals.  The district courtโs denial of a motion for certification is not itself\nappealable.\n(e) Appeals pursuant to judicially created exceptions to the finality rule: Limited exceptions are discussed in cases including, but not limited\nto: Cohen V. Beneficial Indus. Loan Corp., 337 U.S. 541,546,69 S.Ct. 1221, 1225-26, 93 L.Ed. 1528 (1949); Atlantic Fed. Sav. & Loan Assโn\nv. Blythe Eastman Paine Webber, Inc., 890 F. 2d 371, 376 (11th Cir. 1989); Gillespie v. United States Steel Corp., 379 U.S. 148, 157, 85 S. Ct.\n308, 312, 13 L.Ed.2d 199 (1964).\n2. Time for Filing: The timely filing of a notice of appeal is mandatory and jurisdictional.  Rinaldo v. Corbett, 256 F.3d 1276, 1278 (11th Cir. 2001).  In civil\ncases, Fed.R.App.P.4(a) and (c) set the following time limits:\n(a) Fed.R.App.P. 4(a)(1): A notice of appeal in compliance with the requirements set forth in Fed.R.App.P. 3 must be filed in the district court within\n30 days after the entry of the order or judgment appealed from.  However, if the United States or an officer or agency thereof is a party, the notice\nof appeal must be filed in the district court within  60 days after such entry.  THE NOTICE MUST BE RECEIVED AND FILED IN THE\nDISTRICT COURT NO LATER THAN THE LAST DAY OF THE APPEAL PERIOD - no additional days are provided for mailing.\nSpecial filing provisions for inmates are discussed below.\n(b) Fed.R.App.P. 4(a)(3): โIf one party timely files a notice of appeal, any other party may file a notice of appeal within 14 days after the date when\nthe first notice was filed, or within the time otherwise prescribed by this Rule 4(a), whichever period ends later.โ\n(c) Fed.R.App.P.4(a)(4): If any party makes a timely motion in the district court under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure of a type specified in\nthis rule, the time for appeal for all parties runs from the date of entry of the order disposing of the last such timely filed motion.\n(d) Fed.R.App.P.4(a)(5) and 4(a)(6): Under certain limited circumstances, the district court may extend the time to file a notice of appeal.  Under\nRule 4(a)(5), the time may be extended if a motion for an extension is filed within 30 days after expiration of the time otherwise provided to file\na notice of appeal, upon a showing of excusable neglect or good cause.  Under Rule 4(a)(6), the time may be extended if the district court finds\nupon motion that a party did not timely receive notice of the entry of the judgment or order, and that no party would be prejudiced by an extension.\n(e) Fed.R.App.P.4(c): If an inmate confined to an institution files a notice of appeal in either a civil case or a criminal case, the notice of appeal is\ntimely if it is deposited in the institutionโs internal mail system on or before the last day for filing.  Timely filing may be shown by a declaration\nin compliance with 28 U.S.C. Section 1746 or a notarized statement, either of which must set forth the date of deposit and state that first-class\npostage has been prepaid.\n3. Format of the notice of appeal: Form 1, Appendix of Forms to the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, is a suitable format.  See also Fed.R.App.P. 3(c).\nA pro se notice of appeal must be signed by the appellant\n4. Effect of a notice of appeal: A district court loses jurisdiction (authority) to act after the filing of a timely notice of appeal, except for actions in aid of\nappellate jurisdiction or to rule on a timely motion of the type specified in Fed.R.App.P. 4(a)(4).\nRev.: 4/04\n-2-",

This court found that Plaintiff did not properly allege standing, but even if he \nwere able to properly allege standing, based on the facts set forth in the complaint, he \nwould  be  unable  to  state  a  cause  of  action,  and  therefore,  dismissed  the  case  with \nprejudice. \n  The Plaintiff appealed the judgment to the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals. The \ncourt rendered a decision on March 21, 2008, affirming this courtโs decision to dismiss \nthe case for failure to properly allege standing, however, found it was error to consider \n\nCase 8:07-cv-01552-RAL-MAP     Document 25     Filed 03/24/08     Page 2 of 3 PageID 141\nthe  substantive  questions  presented  by  the  case,  stating  the  case  should  have  been \ndismissed on jurisdictional grounds only, and without prejudice. \n  Plaintiff wishes to file an amended complaint, based on similar facts, but which \nhe believes will properly allege standing. Attached hereto is Plaintiffโs proposed amended \ncomplaint, which Plaintiff would request that this Court deem filed, in the event this \nmotion is granted.  \n  While the order of the Appeals Court is silent as to whether the order of dismissal \nwithout prejudice may or shall include leave to amend, it would be appropriate for this \ncourt to dismiss Plaintiffโs case without prejudice with leave to amend, if this court \ndetermines Plaintiff could properly allege standing, even if this court determines Plaintiff \ncould  not  prevail  on  the  merits,  so  that  a  decision  on  the  merits  can  be  made  as \nexpeditiously as possible.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nRespectfully Submitted,  \n              s/Michael A.

See ___ F.3d ___, 2008 WL 744430, at *4 (11th Cir. 2008).  As of today, the\nEleventh Circuit has yet to issue its mandate pursuant to Rule 41 of the Federal Rules of\nAppellate Procedure.  Consequently, this Court lacks jurisdiction to proceed in this case. \nSee Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Gill, 306 F.2d 902, 905 (5th Cir. 1962)\n(observing that โ[i]n the absence of any action by the Supreme Court, a Court of Appeals\nretains jurisdiction, and none is relinquished to the district court, until a mandate or\n\nCase 8:07-cv-01552-RAL-MAP     Document 26     Filed 03/24/08     Page 2 of 3 PageID 239\njudgment is issued.โ) (citations omitted);1 see also United States v. Young, 2008 WL\n583810, at *1 (11th Cir. March 5, 2008) (commenting that a โdistrict court re-acquires\njurisdiction over the case once a mandate remanding the case to the district court issues.โ)\n(citation omitted).\nEven though the Eleventh Circuit has yet to issue its mandate in conformity with\nits recently issued opinion in this case, Plaintiff has nevertheless filed a motion requesting\nthis Court to enter a judgment dismissing his complaint without prejudice and allowing\nhim to file an amended complaint, which he has attached to the motion.2  In light of the\nEleventh Circuit precedent just cited, this Court has no jurisdiction to consider the\nmotion.  Plaintiff can rest assured, however, that once the Eleventh Circuit issues its\nmandate, the Court will obey its terms.  See Young, 2008 WL 583810, at *1 (stating that\nonce โthe appeals court issues a specific mandate, the district court must obey: the\nmandate is not subject to interpretation.โ) (citation omitted).3\n1   In Bonner v. City of Prichard, 661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir. 1981) (en banc)\nthe Eleventh Circuit adopted as binding precedent all decisions of the former Fifth Circuit\nannounced prior to October 1, 1981).\n2   See docket 25.\n3   The Court notes that this is the second instance in this case in which Plaintiff\nhas acted prematurely in seeking relief from the Court.  See docket 5 (denying motion for\nsummary judgment because Plaintiff filed motion prematurely).\n-2-\n\nCase 8:07-cv-01552-RAL-MAP     Document 26     Filed 03/24/08     Page 3 of 3 PageID 240\nACCORDINGLY, it is ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that Plaintiffโs Motion\nfor Entry of Order Dismissing Case Without Prejudice With Leave to Amend (Dkt. 25) is\ndenied without prejudice.\nDONE AND ORDERED at Tampa, Florida, on March 24, 2008.\n     s/Richard A.
