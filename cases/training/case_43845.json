    "summary": "<p>This is a case about allegations of racial gerrymandering in Michigan. On March 23, 2022, twelve Black Michigan voters filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Michigan against the Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson and the Independent Citizens Redistricting Commission, including each Commissioner in their official capacity, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>In November 2018, Michigan voters approved a state constitutional amendment that gave the Michigan Independent Citizens Redistricting Commission the power to draw state legislative districts, instead of the legislature. Mich. Const. Art. IV, &sect; 6. Plaintiffs alleged that the Commission drew House and Senate Districts as racial gerrymanders in violation of &sect; 2 of the Voting Rights Act (Counts I and II) and the Equal Protection Clause of the U.S. Constitution (Counts III and IV) by diluting the voting strength of Black voters.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>In their complaint, plaintiffs alleged that House and Senate District maps for southeastern Michigan had been drawn for nearly half a century to maintain Black voting age populations (BVAP) above 50% to comply with the Voting Rights Act, giving Black voters the opportunity to elect their candidates of choice. They requested that the Court establish a reasonable deadline by which Defendants must redraw maps, adopt Plaintiffs&rsquo; proposals, or appoint a special master to draw &ldquo;constitutionally compliant&rdquo; maps.</p>\r\n<p>The Commission's redistricting plans, explained below, were referred to as the Hickory Plan and the Linden Plan.</p>\r\n<p>The Hickory Plan (House): After the 2010 U.S. Census was released, Michigan legislative districts were drawn to create 10 Black voter majority-minority districts. In comparison, the adoption of the Hickory Plan in 2021 reduced the number of majority-minority districts to 6. Plaintiffs alleged that the Commission lowered the BVAP from Districts with high BVAP to those with far lower BVAPs. Under the 2010 plan, the BVAP among the ten majority-minority districts with the highest BVAPs ranged from 53.4% in District 6 to 94.3% in District 7. Under the Hickory Plan, in contrast, six majority-minority districts have BVAPs ranging from 54.0% in District 18 to 56.8% in District 4.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The Linden Plan (Senate): The ten highest BVAP Senate Districts in 2010 included two Black voter majority-minority districts. In comparison, the Commission&rsquo;s adoption of the Linden plan resulted in no Black voter majority-minority districts. Those two majority-minority districts previously had a BVAP of 54.3% in District 5 and 51.1% in District 2. Under the Linden Plan, the two districts with the highest BVAP have 46.3% in District 7 and 43.7% in District 3.</p>\r\n<p>Plaintiffs alleged that replacing Black majority-minority districts with &ldquo;influence districts&rdquo; dilute Black voter power by relying on the phenomenon of &ldquo;white crossover voting&rdquo; by which white voters and Black voters comprise a District majority that votes for the desired candidate among Black voters. Plaintiffs critiqued the Commission&rsquo;s expert&rsquo;s report (the Handley Report) for relying on data from general elections where white candidates were presumed to be the Black voter candidate of choice, but failing to incorporate models where the favored candidate among Black voters was non-white. Additionally, plaintiffs thought that a proper analysis would focus on the relationship between the BVAP and Democratic primary results rather than general election results.</p>\r\n<p>Plaintiffs alleged that the Commission drew House and Senate district maps with race as the &ldquo;predominant consideration.&rdquo; Plaintiffs generated &ldquo;race blind&rdquo; models that tracked race but did not use it as a constraint; these maps contained House districts yielding BVAPs of about 93%. Because the Hickory Plan&rsquo;s highest district BVAP was 56.8%, plaintiffs alleged that the Commission moved white voters from districts with a moderate BVAP to districts with a high BVAP to dilute Black voting strength. Similarly, had race not been a predominant consideration, plaintiffs claimed the Linden Plan would have produced at least three Black voter majority-minority senate districts in certain counties with high non-white populations. Instead, it produced none.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &sect; 2284, plaintiffs requested a three-judge panel to hear this case as it concerns the constitutionality of the apportionment of congressional districts or any statewide legislative body. On March 29, 2022, Chief Judge of the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals Jeffrey S. Sutton convened a three-judge panel to preside over this case: Circuit Judge of the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, Raymond M. Kethledge, and District Judges of the Western District of Michigan, Janet T. Neff and Paul L. Maloney.</p>\r\n<p>Almost one month later, on April 13, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint that expanded the plaintiffs from twelve to twenty voters.</p>\r\n<p>Circuit Judge Kethledge denied the Secretary of State&rsquo;s motion to dismiss on September 21, 2022. Her primary argument was that plaintiffs lacked standing to sue her because her actions are &ldquo;administrative&rdquo; since the Commission alone draws districts. Circuit Judge Kethledge reasoned that her role as the state&rsquo;s &ldquo;chief election officer&rdquo; makes her responsible for implementing the maps and placing voters into new districts.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On May 9, 2023, the parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. Three months later, on August 29, the court denied the plaintiffs&rsquo; motion and granted the Commission&rsquo;s motion in part. The court held that the plaintiffs lacked standing to challenge House District 13 because the plaintiffs that had lived there later moved to District 9, and the court denied the plaintiffs' motion to amend their complaint to substitute District 9 with District 13. The court also held that res judicata barred the plaintiffs' challenges to House District 26 and Senate District 5 because the Michigan Supreme Court had previously rejected challenges to those districts by some of the same plaintiffs in <em>Detroit Caucus v. Indep. Citizens Redistricting Comm&rsquo;n</em>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The court also granted the Commission&rsquo;s motion for summary judgment on the VRA claims with regard to several districts because the plaintiffs did not establish the preconditions required for a Section 2 VRA claim: the court dismissed the challenge to House District 2 because the plaintiffs in that district failed to show that redistricting would place them in a majority-minority district, and dismissed the challenge to House Districts 8 and 11 and Senate Districts 10 and 11 because the plaintiffs failed to show that Black voters in those districts were politically cohesive. &nbsp;Finally, the court dismissed the plaintiffs&rsquo; Equal Protection challenge to House District 2 because the plaintiffs did not show that the district could have been drawn to contain more Black voters.</p>\r\n<p>Secretary Benson did not take a position on the merits of the claims made by the plaintiffs, but she requested that the court grant her summary judgment for the claims in which the Commission was also granted summary judgment, so it did so.</p>\r\n<p>After the summary judgment ruling, the surviving claims were the challenges to House Districts 1, 7, 10, 12, and 14, and Senate Districts 1, 3, 6, and 8. The court held a bench trial from November 1 to November 8, 2023 on these claims.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On December 21, 2023, the court held that the Michigan Independent Citizens Redistricting Commission drew lines that unconstitutionally separated voters on the basis of race. Specifically, the court found that, based on the transcripts from the Commission, its members had explicitly decided to limit the percentage of Black voters in particular districts based on the assumption that too high a percentage would violate the Voting Rights Act by &ldquo;packing&rdquo; Black voters into fewer districts. The court also held that the use of race in redistricting here did not pass strict scrutiny because it did not serve a compelling governmental interest. The court rejected the Voting Rights Act justification as legally speculative, and noted that the worry about &ldquo;packing&rdquo; would only apply where there were significant majorities of Black voters in a district, which was not the case here. Further, the court found that the Commission lacked evidence for its claim that the districts it created would still allow Black voters to elect their preferred candidates. Therefore, the court held that all the challenged districts violated the Equal Protection Clause and ruled that Michigan could not use those districts in future elections. 2023 WL 8826692.</p>\r\n<p>As of January 3, 2024, the case is ongoing, with the court determining a remedy.</p>",

The plaintiffs sued the Michigan Independent Citizens Redistricting Commission for depriving them of their rights under the United States Constitution and Section 2 of the VRA. The plaintiffs requested that the districts be redrawn using less restrictive means that provide plaintiffs with an opportunity to participate equally in the political process. They claimed that the Redistricting Commisson’s use of race-based discrimination employed while drawing districts denied them equal protection under the law. On December 21, 2023, the Court ruled that the Commission drew the boundaries of plaintiffs' districts based on the race of the voters and that it was a violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the U.S. Constitution.

But they disagree as to how that should occur. Plain-\ntiffs contend that, because Detroit-area voting exhibits a degree of racial polarization, the \nVRA mandates majority-minority districts with Black voting-age populations (BVAPs) above \n50%. And because many district BVAPs in this region in the Commission’s plans fall below \nthat proposed majority-minority threshold, Plaintiffs claim the Commission violated the VRA \nand the Equal Protection Clause. \nThat position is legally wrong. It is constitutionally erroneous to “mechanically rely \nupon numerical percentages,” divorced from the “circumstances” of local voting patterns, in \nassessing whether a plan affords equal electoral opportunity. Alabama Legislative Black Caucus \nv. Alabama, 575 U.S. 254, 277 (2015). The VRA analysis is “functional,” not mechanical. Id. \nat 276 (citation omitted). The statute mandates majority-minority districts only where “effec-\ntive white-bloc voting exists,” meaning that enough white voters vote against Black-preferred \ncandidates to “thwart black voters’ preferences.” Cooper v. Harris, 581 U.S. 285, 304 (2017). \nAccordingly, redistricting authorities must account for “pattern[s] of white crossover voting,” \ni.e., voting by members of the white majority for candidates preferred by the minority, which \ncan obviate the need for majority-minority districts. Id. at 304. \nThe Michigan Independent Citizens Redistricting Commission (the Commission) em-\nployed exactly the kind of functional analysis commanded in precedent. Its data-driven ap-\nproach may be the most thorough and precise a federal court has ever seen in any redistricting \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 69,  PageID.639   Filed 05/09/23   Page 8 of 41\n \ncase. The Commission relied on a comprehensive election analysis and determined that white \ncrossover voting can facilitate equal Black opportunity without majority-minority districts. Its \nplans delivered results in the 2022 elections, sending more Black-preferred candidates to the \nstate legislature from greater Detroit than Plaintiffs’ demonstrative plans could even arguably \nhave achieved. None of this is amenable to a genuine dispute of fact, and summary judgment \nis warranted in the Commission’s favor. \nBACKGROUND \nA.  Factual Background \n1.   After each decennial census, “[s]tates must redistrict to account for any changes \nor shifts in population.” Georgia v. Ashcroft, 539 U.S. 461, 489 n.2 (2003). For most of Michi-\ngan’s history, redistricting was the responsibility of the state legislature. During the 2011 re-\ndistricting, the Republican Party “had a trifecta” in the state government, controlling “the \nHouse, Senate, and governorship.” Joint Appendix (JA) 00486, Trende Dep. 31:20–22.1 This \nenabled Republican politicians to craft and enact redistricting plans to benefit their own elec-\ntoral fortunes “at least to some extent,” JA00486, Trende Dep. 31:22–23, and a federal court \nfound that the legislature “packed” Democratic voters into Detroit-area districts, “making the \nsurrounding districts . . . more Republican.” See League of Women Voters of Mich. v. Benson, 373 \nF. Supp. 3d 867, 882–93 (E.D. Mich. 2019), vacated sub nom, 140 S. Ct. 429 (2019). \nThat was not difficult. Michigan’s Black population is concentrated in a few metropol-\nitan areas, including Detroit. See JA00318–20, Trende Rep. 11–13. Race and political prefer-\nence correlate in Michigan, with Black voters consistently preferring Democratic candidates \nin general elections. JA00334, Trende Rep. 27; see also JA00489–90, Trende Dep. 44:24–45:3. \n \n1 Sean Trende, a senior elections analyst for the website RealClear Politics, JA00309, Trende \nRep. 2, is Plaintiffs’ principal expert witness, whose opinions they offer on all threshold Sec-\ntion 2 elements and all equal-protection issues. See JA00313, Trende Rep. 6–7. \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 69,  PageID.640   Filed 05/09/23   Page 9 of 41\n \nAs a result, drawing compact districts wholly within Detroit will naturally “pack” voters who \nare Black and lean Democratic and dilute their voting strength elsewhere, to Republican \nstatewide benefit. JA00232–37, Rodden Rep. 6–11. The Michigan legislature did that in 2011. \nJA00243, Rodden Rep. at 17. It defended this approach by claiming the VRA commands this \nconcentration of Black voters into a few districts with high BVAPs. Id. In the 2011 state house \nplan, 11 districts were majority-Black, including districts with BVAPs as high as 92% (HD7), \n90% (HD8), 88% (HD3), and 72% (HD9). JA00326, Trende Rep. 19. In the state senate plan, \none or two districts were majority-Black (depending on the calculation).2 JA00329, Trende \nRep. 22. \nBetween 2011 and 2020, Black voters did not need majority-Black districts to elect \ntheir preferred candidates in legislative elections. In the state house, Black-preferred candi-\ndates frequently won elections in districts from 26.53% to 47% BVAP. See JA00049, 2021 \nHandley Rep. 25. In state senate elections, Black-preferred candidates also won in districts \nbelow 50% BVAP, including SD6 (21.29% BVAP), SD11 (35.48%), SD4 (47%), and SD3 \n(48.14%). JA00050, 2021 Handley Rep. 26; see also JA00034, 2021 Handley Rep.  10. \n2.  In 2018, “voters in . . . Michigan approved [a] constitutional amendment[] cre-\nating [a] multimember commission[] that [is] responsible . . . for creating and approving dis-\ntrict maps for congressional and legislative districts.” Rucho v. Common Cause, 139 S. Ct. 2484, \n2507 (2019) (citing Mich. Const. art. IV, § 6). The amendment “transferred the power to draw \n \n2 From the census, there are “slightly different” ways of calculating a district’s BVAP, “de-\npend[ing] upon whether the total number of blacks includes those people who self-identify as \nboth black and a member of another minority group, such as Hispanic.” Georgia, 539 U.S. at \n474 n.1. The Commission’s principal VRA expert, Dr. Lisa Handley, utilized a method ex-\ncluding persons who identify as both Black and Hispanic, see JA00003, 2023 Handley Report \n3 n.5, and Plaintiffs’ expert, Sean Trende, utilized different measures at different points of his \nreport. The differences are minor (about one or one-and-a-half percentage points) and imma-\nterial to any case issue. This memorandum states BVAPs according to the source material \ncited in each given instance. \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 69,  PageID.641   Filed 05/09/23   Page 10 of 41\n \nthose lines from the State Legislature to a newly created” Commission, Banerian v. Benson, \n597 F. Supp. 3d 1163, 1165 (W.D. Mich.) (three-judge court), appeal dismissed, 143 S. Ct. 400 \n(2022), which is composed of 13 registered voters, randomly selected by the secretary of state, \nfour of whom identify as Republicans, four of whom identify as Democrats, and five of whom \naffiliate with neither major party. Mich. Const. art. IV, § 6(2)(f).  \nThe amendment directs the Commission to draw districts according to seven redis-\ntricting criteria in descending “order of priority.” Banerian v. Benson, 589 F. Supp. 3d 735, 736–\n37 (W.D. Mich. 2022) (three-judge court) (quoting Mich. Const. art. IV, § 6(13)). These in-\nclude that districts comply with federal law, be contiguous, “reflect the state’s diverse popu-\nlation and communities of interest,” “not favor or disfavor an incumbent elected official or a \ncandidate,” and “reflect consideration of county, city, and township boundaries.” Mich. \nConst. art. IV, § 6(13). The fourth-ranked criterion dictates that “[d]istricts shall not provide \na disproportionate advantage to any political party.” Id. § 6(13)(d). The provision explains \nthat “[a] disproportionate advantage to a political party shall be determined using accepted \nmeasures of partisan fairness.” Id. This criterion is above, and superior to, the consideration \nof political-subdivision boundaries and compactness. Cf. Banerian, 589 F. Supp. 3d at 738. \n3.  The Commission first convened in September 2020 in preparation for its inau-\ngural redistricting. But this decade’s redistricting proved uniquely challenging. The Commis-\nsion found itself in “the difficult and unenviable position of undertaking its inaugural redis-\ntricting cycle without the full benefit of tabulated decennial census data,” because the U.S. \nCensus Bureau released the necessary redistricting data “six months late” due to the global \npandemic. In re Indep. Citizens Redistricting Comm’n for State Legislative & Cong. Dist.’s Duty to \nRedraw Districts by Nov. 1, 2021, 507 Mich. 1025, 961 N.W.2d 211, 212 (Mich. 2021) (Welch, \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 69,  PageID.642   Filed 05/09/23   Page 11 of 41\n \nJ., concurring). This delay made it impossible for the Commission to achieve its constitutional \nduty to prepare and enact plans by November 1. Mich. Const. art. IV, § 6(7).  \nDespite these challenges, the Commission “act[ed] diligently pursuant to its constitu-\ntional mandate.” In re Indep. Citizens Redistricting Comm’n, 961 N.W.2d at 212 (Welch, J., con-\ncurring). The Commission met or surpassed every metric of public observation and participa-\ntion, holding nearly 140 public meetings as of the time it adopted redistricting plans and re-\nceiving nearly 30,000 public comments. See Banerian, 597 F. Supp. 3d at 1166. \n4.  To ensure its plans would “comply with the voting rights act and other federal \nlaws,” Mich. Const. art. IV, § 6(13)(a), the Commission engaged accomplished VRA experts. \nThe Commission hired an internationally recognized expert, Dr. Lisa Handley, who has in \nher career of more than 30 years advised redistricting authorities across the nation, the U.S. \nDepartment of Justice Voting Rights Section (the Voting Rights Section), and civil-rights or-\nganizations. JA00016–17, 2023 Handley Rep., CV at 1–2. The Commission also retained a \nnationally recognized voting-rights attorney, Bruce Adelson, who formerly worked with the \nVoting Rights Section and has also advised redistricting authorities. Mr. Adelson or Dr. \nHandley (or both) spoke at 36 Commission meetings between April and December 2021.3 Dr. \nHandley provided the Commission with written presentations in September and November \n2021 and submitted a final report in late December 2021.4 \n \n3 The specific dates included April 8, June 28 and 30, July 8 and 9, August 6 and 19, Septem-\nber 1, 2, 9, 14, 20, 21, 22, 23, 27, 28, 29, and 30, October 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 27, 28, 29, \nNovember 1, 3, 4, 5, and December 2 and 28, 2021. See Meeting Notices & Materials Archives, \nMichigan Indep. Citizens Redistricting Comm’n, https://www.michigan.gov/micrc/meet-\ning-notices-and-materials-archives (last visited May 4, 2023). \n4 The report was finalized as of January 4, 2022, but is referred to here as Dr. Handley’s “2021 \nReport” because the Commission had a near final version as of December 28, 2021. Dr. Hand-\nley also submitted an expert report in this case, referred to as her “2023 Report,” JA00001, \nwhich incorporates the 2021 Report as Appendix A, JA00024.  \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 69,  PageID.643   Filed 05/09/23   Page 12 of 41\n \nDr. Handley conducted a polarized voting analysis of every county in Michigan hav-\ning large enough minority populations to accurately estimate voting preferences. JA00029, \n2021 Handley Rep. 5. Because of the secret ballot, voting preferences of different racial or \nethnic groups cannot be discerned from precinct-level returns, and experts must infer them by \nstatistical means. JA00026, 2021 Handley Rep. 2; JA00565, Sept. 2, 2021 Tr. 20. To do this, \nDr. Handley used industry standard methods, ecological inference (EI) and ecological regres-\nsion (ER). JA00026–27, 2021 Handley Rep. 2–3. Dr. Handley analyzed all federal and \nstatewide general election contests from 2012 through 2020, including the only statewide \nDemocratic  primary  in  the  prior  decade  (the  2018  gubernatorial  race).  JA00029–30, \n2021 Handley Rep. 5–6. Dr. Handley found consistent (but not uniform) polarization be-\ntween Black and white voters, meaning that Black and white voters generally prefer different \ncandidates in both general and Democratic primary elections.5 JA00030–36, 2021 Handley \nRep. 6–12. Dr. Handley concluded: “Because voting in Michigan is racially polarized, dis-\ntricts that provide minority voters with an opportunity to elect their candidates of choice must \nbe drawn.” JA00041, 2021 Handley Rep. 17. \nHowever, both Dr. Handley and Mr. Adelson advised the Commission not to “choose \nan arbitrary target” of BVAP for these districts, such as that “50% voting age population is \nwhat we need to maintain these minority districts.” JA00567, Sept. 2, 2021 Tr. 25; see also \nJA00569, Sept. 2, 2021 Tr. 29, MICRC_005388 (Adelson). Instead, they advised the Com-\nmission to rely on “a District specific functional analysis in each area.” JA00567, Sept. 2, \n2021 Tr. 25. Dr. Handley examined “estimates of participation rates[,] minority cohesion[,] \nand white cross over” voting for Black-preferred candidates. JA00567, Sept. 2, 2021 Tr. 25; \nJA00041–48, 2021 Handley Rep. 17–24. Dr. Handley also looked to election results from the \n \n5 Very few Black voters participate in Republican primaries, so those elections are not in-\nformative as to Black voting preferences. \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 69,  PageID.644   Filed 05/09/23   Page 13 of 41\n \nprior decade in districts ranging between 20% and more than 90% BVAP. JA00048–50, 2021 \nHandley Rep. 24–26. Dr. Handley concluded that white crossover voting affords Black voters \nan equal opportunity to elect their representatives of choice in districts with BVAPs below a \nmajority, and she advised the Commission that “in no county is a 50% BVAP district required \nfor the Black-preferred candidates to carry the district in a general election.” JA00045, 2021 \nHandley Rep. 21. Dr. Handley’s analysis shows that districts of 35% BVAP or higher in \nWayne and Genesee Counties, and of 40% BVAP or higher in Oakland and Saginaw Coun-\nties, would preserve equal Black electoral opportunity. See id.  \nDrawing  districts  of  significantly  higher  BVAPs  would,  Dr.  Handley  observed, \n“pack[]” Black voters into a few districts and dilute their voting strength in neighboring dis-\ntricts. JA00565, Sept. 2, 2021 Tr. 20. Dr. Handley observed the 2011 state house districts with \nhigh BVAPs and concluded: “Those are packed.” JA00568, Sept. 2, 2021 Tr. 28.  \n5.  The Commission relied on this advice. In their draft plans, Commission mem-\nbers did not carry forward Detroit-area districts with 70%, 80%, and 90% BVAPs. The plans \nthe Commission ultimately adopted were the Hickory plan (for the state house) and the Lin-\nden plan (for the state senate). Plaintiffs’ expert, Sean Trende, reports that the Hickory plan \ncontains 16 districts in the Detroit metropolitan region above 35% BVAP, ranging from 35.8% \nBVAP (HD26) to 55.6% BVAP (HD4), JA00326, Trende Rep. 19, and Dr. Handley’s report \nshows similar (slightly higher) BVAPs for the same districts, JA00011, 2023 Handley Rep. \n11, table 4; see note 2, supra. The Linden plan contains six Detroit-area districts within the \nrange Dr. Handley identified as affording equal electoral opportunity. JA00329, Trende Rep. \n22. Both plans contain districts that fall below BVAP majorities but are within the ranges \ndemonstrated by Dr. Handley to afford equal Black opportunity in conjunction with reliable \nwhite crossover voting. In redistricting parlance, these are called “crossover districts.” See \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 69,  PageID.645   Filed 05/09/23   Page 14 of 41\n \nCooper, 581 U.S. at 303; Bartlett v. Strickland, 556 U.S. 1, 13 (2009) (plurality opinion). The \nCommission looked to Dr. Handley’s report, and past election results recompiled within the \nnew district boundaries, to ensure that these districts would likely ensure equal Black electoral \nopportunity. See JA00050–51, 2021 Handley Rep. 26–27. \nThis was not the Commission’s only goal. Among many other things, the Commission \ntook care to avoid affording a “disproportionate advantage” to any political party. Mich. \nConst. art. IV, § 6(13)(d). Toward that end, Dr. Handley provided guidance to the Commis-\nsion on partisan-fairness analyses in addition to her racial-bloc-voting analysis, identifying \nstandard measures of partisan fairness and acceptable ranges of fairness under those stand-\nards. JA00052–57, 2021 Handley Rep. 28–33. Commissioners worked to achieve neutral par-\ntisan-fairness scores—i.e., scores that do not favor one major party over the other—and they \navoided packing Democratic voters into a few Detroit-area districts. JA00579–84, Commis-\nsion Rep. 26–31; JA00592–602, Commission Rep. 45–55; JA00239, Rodden Rep. 13, Tbl. 1. \nB.  Procedural History \n1.  The Commission adopted the Linden and Hickory plans on December 28, \n2021. Its plans drew legal challenges from across the political spectrum. One group of Black \nvoters and an advocacy group filed suit in the Michigan Supreme Court, contending that the \nHickory and Linden plans (as well as the Commission’s congressional plan) lack a sufficient \nnumber of majority-minority districts to satisfy the VRA. Detroit Caucus v. Indep. Citizens Re-\ndistricting Comm’n, 969 N.W.2d 331, 331 (Mich.), reconsideration denied, 509 Mich. 859, 969 \nN.W.2d 515 (2022). The Michigan Supreme Court denied relief, concluding that evidence \nshowed “significant white crossover voting for Black-preferred candidates that had the effect \nof affording Black voters an equal opportunity to elect representatives of their choice even in \nthe absence of 50%+ majority-minority districts.” Id. at 333. The Michigan Supreme Court \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 69,  PageID.646   Filed 05/09/23   Page 15 of 41\n \nrejected the plaintiffs’ argument that “the mere absence of an equivalent number of race-\nbased, majority-minority districts in the adopted plans as compared to Michigan’s existing \ncongressional and state legislative districts” is “the measure of vote dilution under the VRA.” \nId. at 332. \nIn a separate case, the League of Women Voters and other advocacy organizations \nchallenged the Linden plan’s compliance with the Michigan Constitution’s partisan-fairness \nrequirement, contending that the plan was improperly biased in favor of Republican Party \nelectoral interests, and the Michigan Supreme Court rejected that challenge as well.6 See \nLeague of Women Voters of Michigan v. Indep. Citizens Redistricting Comm’n, 509 Mich. 885, 971 \nN.W.2d 595 (Mich. 2022). \n2.  Plaintiffs in this case are Black Michigan voters who live in the Detroit metro-\npolitan region. They filed the original complaint on March 23, 2022, and the operative \namended complaint (the Complaint) on April 13, 2022. ECF No. 8, PageID.83. In four causes \nof action, the Complaint challenges 10 Detroit-region house districts (HD1, HD2, HD7, \nHD8, HD10, HD11, HD12, HD13, HD14, and HD26) and seven Detroit-region senate dis-\ntricts (SD1, SD3, SD5, SD6, SD8, SD10, and SD11) under VRA Section 2 and the Equal \nProtection Clause. Compl. ¶¶ 147–212, PageID.135–51. Most of the challenged districts are \ncrossover districts falling within the BVAP ranges Dr. Handley identified as affording equal \nopportunity; Plaintiffs do not challenge the seven majority-minority districts in the Hickory \nplan, see JA00326, Trende Rep. 19. However, three challenged districts (HD2, SD5 and SD11) \nhave respective BVAPs of around 11%, 18%, and 19%—well below the majority-minority \nline. JA00326, JA00329, Trende Rep. 19, 22; see also JA00578, JA00589, Commission Rep. \n24, 41. \n \n6 The 2022 elections confirmed that the Commission’s plans do not disproportionately favor \nRepublican electoral interests. \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 69,  PageID.647   Filed 05/09/23   Page 16 of 41\n \nIn their VRA claims, Plaintiffs contend that the challenged districts must be configured \nas majority-minority districts to satisfy the VRA. See Compl. ¶¶ 147–180, PageID.135–42. In \ntheir equal-protection claims, Plaintiffs contend that the Commission’s choice to configure \nthese districts within BVAP ranges supported by Dr. Handley’s report amounts to racially \npredominant redistricting and that the Commission “cannot argue that Section 2 VRA com-\npliance satisfies strict scrutiny because the [Challenged] Districts are not in compliance.” \nCompl. ¶¶ 193, 208, PageID.146, PageID.150. \n3.  In August and November 2022, the Hickory and Linden plans were used in \nprimary and general elections. Black-preferred candidates won every general-election contest \nin Detroit-area districts with a BVAP greater than 25%. JA00010, 2023 Handley Rep. 10. In \nthe Democratic primaries, candidates preferred by Black voters won 16 of 22 state legislative \ncontests in the Detroit-area, including in districts with BVAPs of 25.5% (SD2), 34% (HD3), \n39.7% (HD1), and 39.8% (HD13). JA00013, 2023 Handley Rep. 13. Meanwhile, the Black-\npreferred candidate did not succeed in one of the Hickory plan’s majority-minority districts \n(HD5 (56.9%)), and Black voters did not cohesively support Black candidates who lost in \nother districts. Id. As a result of these elections, five senate and 14 house candidates preferred \nby Black voters in the Detroit-area are now seated in the Michigan legislature. See JA00011, \n2023 Handley Rep. 11. In only three of 17 challenged districts (SD8, HD26, and SD1) did a \ncohesive Black voting bloc not succeed in electing its preferred candidate in a Democratic \nprimary. Id.  \n4.  This case has been in discovery since November 2022. Plaintiffs did not depose \nany Commission members or any of the Commission’s disclosed experts, including Dr. Hand-\nley. Plaintiffs rely on the expert opinions of Mr. Trende, who prepared alternative plans re-\nconfiguring Detroit-area house and senate districts to include 10 majority-minority house \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 69,  PageID.648   Filed 05/09/23   Page 17 of 41\n \ndistricts—including districts with BVAPs of 92%, 81%, 74% and 63%, JA00331, Trende Rep. \n24—and five majority-minority Senate districts—for an increase of three (arguably four) ma-\njority-minority districts from the 2011 senate plan, JA00390, Trende Rep. 83. The “thrust” of \nPlaintiffs’ claims is that the Linden and Hickory plans are legally infirm because they fall short \nof these demonstrative plans in providing Black electoral opportunity. See JA00496, Trende \nDep. 80:1–5. \nTHE LEGAL STANDARD \n“Summary judgment is appropriate where there is ‘no genuine dispute as to any ma-\nterial fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.’” Romans v. Michigan \nDep’t of Hum. Servs., 668 F.3d 826, 835 (6th Cir. 2012) (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a)). The \nmoving party “bears the initial responsibility of informing the district court of the basis for its \nmotion” and “demonstrat[ing] the absence of a genuine issue of material fact.” Harvey v. \nCampbell Cnty., Tenn., 453 F. App’x 557, 560 (6th Cir. 2011) (quoting Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, \n477 U.S. 317, 323 (1986)).  \nWhere the moving party does not bear the ultimate trial burden, the threshold sum-\nmary-judgment “burden may be discharged by ‘showing—that is, pointing out to the district \ncourt—that there is an absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party’s case.’” Gen. \nMotors Corp. v. Lanard Toys, Inc., 468 F.3d 405, 412 (6th Cir. 2006) (citation omitted). If that \nshowing is made, “the nonmoving party must ‘go beyond the pleadings and by her own affi-\ndavits, or by the depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, designate \n‘specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.’” Harvey, 453 F. App’x at 560 \n(quoting Celotex, 477 U.S. at 325) (internal quotation marks omitted). “[T]he facts and any \ninferences that can be drawn from those facts, must be viewed in the light most favorable to \nthe non-moving party.” Gen. Motors, 468 F.3d at 412 (citation omitted). \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 69,  PageID.649   Filed 05/09/23   Page 18 of 41\n \nARGUMENT \nI.  Threshold Deficiencies Preclude Plaintiffs’ Claims Against Three Challenged Dis-\ntricts (HD13, HD26, and SD5) \nPlaintiffs’ claims cannot be established as to three districts (HD13, HD26, and SD5) \nbased on threshold deficiencies. \nA.  Article III Jurisdiction \nPlaintiffs lack a continued basis of standing to challenge HD13. “Article III of the U.S. \nConstitution permits federal courts to adjudicate ‘cases or controversies,’ not any political \ndispute that happens to arise” among willing litigants. Arizona v. Biden, 40 F.4th 375, 383 (6th \nCir. 2022). To have standing to challenge a law, plaintiffs “must show that they have suffered \nan ‘injury in fact’ ‘caused’ by the [law] that a favorable decision would ‘redress.’” Id. (quoting \nLujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560–561 (1992)). Applying that standard to racial-\ngerrymandering claims, the Supreme Court held in United States v. Hays, 515 U.S. 737 (1995), \nthat a plaintiff who “resides in a racially gerrymandered district” has standing to challenge \nthat district, but a plaintiff who “does not live in such a district” generally does not. Id. at 745–\n46. Subsequently, the Supreme Court extended that rule to claims of vote dilution. See Gill v. \nWhitford, 138 S. Ct. 1916, 1930 (2018); see also, e.g., Petteway v. Galveston Cnty., -- F. Supp. 3d \n--, 2023 WL 2782704, *5 (S.D. Tex. Mar. 30, 2023) (holding that voter who did not reside in \na challenged district lacked standing to bring VRA vote-dilution claim).7 \nHere, no Plaintiff resides in HD13, and any challenge to it is, at best, “a generalized \ngrievance against governmental conduct . . . .” Gill, 138 S. Ct. at 1930 (citation omitted). Alt-\nhough two Plaintiffs formerly resided in HD13, both have since moved and no longer reside \nthere. Compl. ¶ 18, PageID.89 (Bennett); Compl. ¶ 19, PageID.90 (Black, Jr.); JA00537, Pl. \n \n7 Because redistricting claims proceed district-by-district, the Commission has provided a \nchart appended to this brief clarifying which of its discrete arguments apply to each respective \nchallenged district. \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 69,  PageID.650   Filed 05/09/23   Page 19 of 41\n \nBennett’s Objs. & Responses to ROG No. 1 (now resident of HD14); JA00542, Pl. Black, Jr.’s \nObjs. & Responses to ROG No. 1 (now resident of HD9). As a result, HD13’s configuration \ndoes not impose “individual harm,” and an injunction would not “vindicate the individual \nrights” of any Plaintiff. Gill, 138 S. Ct. at 1932–33. Because “[p]laintiffs must maintain their \npersonal interest in the dispute at all stages of litigation,” TransUnion LLC v. Ramirez, 141 S. \nCt. 2190, 2208 (2021), and establish the elements of standing “with the manner and degree of \nevidence required at the successive stages of the litigation,” Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561, these \nPlaintiffs no longer have standing to challenge HD13. See Shaw v. Hunt, 517 U.S. 899, 904 \n(1996) (Shaw II) (holding that claim could proceed only as to plaintiffs who resided in alleg-\nedly racially gerrymandered district and only against that district); Sinkfield v. Kelley, 531 U.S. \n28, 29–30 (2000) (dismissing entire action on this basis). Moreover, any prior claim to stand-\ning no longer presents a live controversy, and the claims against HD13 are moot. See Chen v. \nCity of Houston, 9 F. Supp. 2d 745, 749 (S.D. Tex. 1998), aff’d, 206 F.3d 502 (5th Cir. 2000) \n(finding moot claims by voters who moved from challenged districts).  \nB.  Res Judicata \nPlaintiffs’ claims against HD26 and SD5 are barred by res judicata. Under the Consti-\ntution’s Full Faith and Credit Clause, U.S. Const. art. IV, § 1, and the Full Faith and Credit \nAct, 28 U.S.C. § 1738, “federal courts are to give the judgments of state courts the same pre-\nclusive effect as would be given in the state in which the judgment was rendered.” Osborn v. \nAshland Cnty. Bd. of Alcohol, Drug Addiction & Mental Health Servs., 979 F.2d 1131, 1133 (6th \nCir. 1992). In this case, the only Plaintiff residing in HD26 and SD5 was a plaintiff in Detroit \nCaucus, which rejected a claim asserting that the Commission’s state legislative and congres-\nsional redistricting plans are dilutive “in violation of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.” 969 \nN.W.2d at 931. \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 69,  PageID.651   Filed 05/09/23   Page 20 of 41\n \nUnder Michigan law, “a second, subsequent action” is barred by a prior action “when \n(1) the prior action was decided on the merits, (2) both actions involve the same parties or \ntheir privies, and (3) the matter in the second case was, or could have been, resolved in the \nfirst.” Adair v. State, 470 Mich. 105, 121, 680 N.W.2d 386, 396 (Mich. 2004). These elements \nare met here as to HD26 and SD5. The Detroit Caucus case was decided on the merits, as the \nMichigan Supreme Court rejected the claims for relief. Detroit Caucus, 969 N.W.2d at 331 \n(“[T]he relief requested is DENIED”). Both actions involve the same plaintiff: the Plaintiff \nresiding in HD26 and SD5 (Norma McDaniel) was a plaintiff in Detroit Caucus.

And the Detroit Caucus case involved challenges to \nthe Linden and Hickory plans, which sound in the same VRA § 2 theory tendered in this case. \nJA00554–559, Detroit Caucus First Amend. Verified Compl., ¶¶ 40–57. \nAlthough the Detroit Caucus plaintiffs formally brought their VRA challenge as fun-\nneled through the Michigan Constitutional requirement that Commission plans “comply with \nthe voting rights act and other federal laws,” see 969 N.W.2d at 331 (quoting Mich. Const. \nart. 4, § 6(13)(a)), and although they presented no racial-gerrymandering claim, that is imma-\nterial. Michigan Supreme Court precedent “has taken a broad approach to the doctrine of res \njudicata, holding that it bars not only claims already litigated, but also every claim arising \nfrom the same transaction that the parties, exercising reasonable diligence, could have raised \nbut did not.” Adair, 470 Mich. at 121, 680 N.W.2d at 396. With reasonable diligence, the \nplaintiffs in Detroit Caucus could have formally stated a VRA claim and joined to it a racial-\ngerrymandering claim. See Tafflin v. Levitt, 493 U.S. 455, 458–59 (1990) (“[S]tate courts have \ninherent authority . . . to adjudicate claims arising under the laws of the United States.”). \nThey did not. This element, too, is satisfied. \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 69,  PageID.652   Filed 05/09/23   Page 21 of 41\n \nFinally, no other Plaintiffs have standing to challenge HD26 and SD5, as they do not \nreside there. See § I.A, supra. Thus, through a combination of res judicata and Article III stand-\ning doctrine, the claims against these districts must be dismissed. \nII.  Plaintiffs’ Claims Under the VRA Fail as a Matter of Law \nPlaintiffs have alleged that 10 Michigan house districts (HD1, HD2, HD7, HD8, \nHD10, HD11, HD12, HD13, HD14, and HD26) and seven Michigan senate districts (SD1, \nSD3,  SD5,  SD6,  SD8,  SD10,  and  SD11)  violate  the  VRA.  See  Compl.  ¶¶ 147–80, \nPageID.135–42. However, they cannot create a triable question of fact on these claims. \nA.  The Legal Standard \nVRA § 2 prohibits any voting “standard, practice, or procedure” that “results in a de-\nnial or abridgement of the right of any citizen of the United States to vote on account of race \nor  color.”  52  U.S.C.  § 10301(a).  Such  a  violation  occurs  if  “members  of  a  [protected] \nclass . . . have less opportunity than other members of the electorate to participate in the po-\nlitical process and to elect representatives of their choice.” Id. § 10301(b). A redistricting plan \nmay violate § 2 if it results in “the dispersal of blacks into districts in which they constitute an \nineffective minority of voters or . . . the concentration of blacks into districts where they con-\nstitute an excessive majority.” Thornburg v. Gingles, 478 U.S. 30, 46 n.11 (1986) (plurality \nopinion). \nPlaintiffs advancing a vote-dilution theory under VRA § 2 must prove “three threshold \nconditions”: that (1) the relevant minority group is “‘sufficiently large and geographically \ncompact to constitute a majority’ in some reasonably configured legislative district”; (2) that \nthe group is “politically cohesive”; and (3) that the white majority votes “‘sufficiently as a \nbloc’ to usually ‘defeat the minority’s preferred candidate.’” Cooper, 581 U.S. at 301–02 (quot-\ning Gingles, 478 U.S. at 50–51). “If a plaintiff makes that showing, it must then go on to prove \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 69,  PageID.653   Filed 05/09/23   Page 22 of 41\n \nthat, under the totality of the circumstances, the district lines dilute the votes of the members \nof the minority group.” Abbott v. Perez, 138 S. Ct. 2305, 2331 (2018).  \nB.  The First Gingles Precondition \nPlaintiffs cannot create a triable question of fact under the first precondition in three \ndistinct respects.   \n1.  There is no triable question whether an “alternative to the districting decision \nat issue would . . . enhance the ability of minority voters to elect the candidates of their \nchoice.” Abbott, 138 S. Ct. at 2332. Because a plaintiff cannot establish that an existing elec-\ntoral procedure abridges the right to vote without “a hypothetical alternative” demonstrating \n“what the right to vote ought to be,” Reno v. Bossier Par. Sch. Bd., 528 U.S. 320, 334 (2000), the \nfirst Gingles precondition “dictates that the issue of remedy is part of the plaintiff’s prima facie \ncase,” Nipper v. Smith, 39 F.3d 1494, 1530 (11th Cir. 1994); see also Hines v. Mayor & Town \nCouncil of Ahoskie, 998 F.2d 1266, 1273 (4th Cir. 1993). A Section 2 challenger must establish \nthat at least “another opportunity district is possible at the present time.”8 Abbott, 138 S. Ct. \nat 2333. \nFor example, in Abbott, a Section 2 challenger’s illustrative remedial plan created a \nsecond majority-Latino district in a county where the challenged plan created only one. Id. \nBut the evidence failed to establish that the second district would be a “performing Latino \ndistrict,” and the Supreme Court therefore reversed the lower court’s finding of Section 2 \nliability. Id. at 2332–34. Following Abbott, the Fifth Circuit in Harding v. County of Dallas, \nTexas, 948 F.3d 302 (5th Cir. 2020), rejected a Section 2 claim because the “plaintiffs did not \noffer any evidence at trial that would show how” candidates preferred by the allegedly \n \n8 Although some courts locate this requirement under the totality-of-the-circumstances in-\nquiry, rather than the first Gingles precondition, see Fusilier v. Landry, 963 F.3d 447, 462 (5th \nCir. 2020), the requirement of proof is the same regardless of labelling, see id. (rejecting claim \non this basis). \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 69,  PageID.654   Filed 05/09/23   Page 23 of 41\n \naggrieved racial group “would fare in commissioner elections under their Remedial Plan.” Id. \nat 311; see also id. at 308–15.  \nThere is no triable fact question under this standard here. Plaintiffs’ expert, Mr. \nTrende, prepared alternative, demonstrative configurations of the greater Detroit metropoli-\ntan area containing more majority-Black districts than the Linden and Hickory plans. But \nPlaintiffs have no evidence to show how candidates preferred by the Black community would \nfare in elections under their demonstrative plans. The mere inclusion of majority-Black dis-\ntricts  proves nothing. “[T]he creation of majority-minority districts[] does not invariably min-\nimize or maximize minority voting strength. Instead, it can have either effect or neither.” \nVoinovich v. Quilter, 507 U.S. 146, 154 (1993). “Which effect the practice has, if any at all, \ndepends entirely on the facts and circumstances of each case.” Id. Accordingly, a Section 2 \nplaintiff must show that an alternative scheme will functionally enhance minority electoral \nopportunity. Harding, 948 F.3d at 310. Plaintiffs have no evidence to show this. \nMr. Trende did not analyze whether the majority-minority districts in his illustrative \nplans will provide minority opportunity that does not exist under the challenged plans. \nJA00500–01, Trende Dep. Tr. 157:18–24, 158:3–17. Mr. Trende also did not analyze whether \nthe majority-minority districts in his illustrative plans will perform (i.e., enable Black voters \nto elect candidates of their choice). JA00491–92, Trende Dep. 51:24–52:6.9 Improved minor-\nity opportunity cannot be assumed in this way: “an alternative map containing an additional \nmajority-minority district does not necessarily establish an increased opportunity.” Harding, \n948 F.3d at 310. As in Abbott and Harding, Plaintiffs have nothing but BVAP percentages and \nbald assertions. \n \n9 In addition to demonstrative plans, Mr. Trende produced computer-simulated plans, but he \ndid not analyze whether they would improve minority opportunity. JA00501, Trende Dep. \n158:11–23. \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 69,  PageID.655   Filed 05/09/23   Page 24 of 41\n \nMoreover, the record shows that the 50% BVAP mark carries no electoral significance. \nBlack-preferred candidates can prevail, even in Democratic primaries, in districts below 50% \nBVAP, as the 2022 elections show, see JA00011–13, 2023 Handley Rep. 11–13, and as Mr. \nTrende concedes, see JA00487–88, Trende Dep. 32:23–33:1. And, sometimes, Black-preferred \ncandidates lose in districts above 50% BVAP (as occurred in HD5, a majority-minority district \nnot challenged in this case). JA00011–12, 2023 Handley Rep. 11–12. The number 50% is not \na talismanic divide between effective and ineffective districts. The question of performance is \ninstead an evidentiary one. No evidence sustains Plaintiffs’ burden to show that their illustra-\ntive districts are likely to perform, and there is otherwise “an absence of evidence” on this \nelement. Gen. Motors, 468 F.3d at 412. By failing to analyze district performance, Plaintiffs \nhave established “only that lines could have been drawn elsewhere, nothing more.” Johnson \nv. De Grandy, 512 U.S. 997, 1015 (1994). \n2.  Even if it were assumed (against the law and evidence) that majority-minority \ndistricts will per se perform as opportunity districts, there is still no evidence that Mr. Trende’s \nplans will outperform the Linden and Hickory plans, which were configured to ensure equal \nelectoral opportunity in light of observed voting patterns. The Hickory and Linden plans have \nalready matched and even outperformed the minority opportunity Mr. Trende’s demonstra-\ntive plans could ever purport to deliver. \nAlthough VRA § 2 does not require that redistricting authorities create crossover dis-\ntricts, the Supreme Court has signaled that states may voluntarily create them “as a matter of \nlegislative choice or discretion.” Bartlett, 556 U.S. at 23 (plurality opinion). Indeed, Supreme \nCourt precedent encourages crossover districts because they “may serve to diminish the sig-\nnificance and influence of race by encouraging minority and majority voters to work together \ntoward a common goal.” Id. at 23. Majority-minority districts “rely on a quintessentially race-\n18 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 69,  PageID.656   Filed 05/09/23   Page 25 of 41\n \nconscious calculus aptly described as the ‘politics of second best,’” and the Supreme Court \nhas discouraged them in “communities in which minority citizens are able to form coalitions \nwith voters from other racial and ethnic groups, having no need to be a majority within a \nsingle district in order to elect candidates of their choice.” Johnson, 512 U.S. at 1020 (citation \nomitted). For this reason, the Court has explained that “States can—and in proper cases \nshould—defend against alleged § 2 violations by pointing to crossover voting patterns and to \neffective crossover districts.” Bartlett, 556 U.S. at 24. To compel states to draw majority-mi-\nnority districts even where crossover districts perform would “tend to entrench the very prac-\ntices and stereotypes the Equal Protection Clause is set against.” Johnson, 512 U.S. at 1029 \n(Kennedy, J., concurring in part and concurring in the judgment). Yet that is the constitution-\nally problematic compulsion Plaintiffs advocate. \nHere, the Linden and Hickory plans have delivered as much as, if not more, minority \nsuccess than Mr. Trende’s demonstrative plans purport to facilitate, and they have done so \nwithout the “deliberate segregation” involved in majority-minority districts, Shaw v. Reno, 509 \nU.S. 630, 641 (1993) (Shaw I). The Hickory plan provides 16 Detroit-area districts above 35% \nBVAP, JA00326, Trende Rep. 19, compared to 11 in Mr. Trende’s demonstrative house plan, \nJA00331–33, Trende Rep. 24–26, and the Linden plan provides six such districts, JA00329, \nTrende Rep. 22, compared to Mr. Trende’s five. JA00390, Trende Rep. 83. According to the \nevidence-based approach of Dr. Handley—employing the “functional” approached endorsed \nby the Supreme Court, Bethune-Hill v. Virginia State Bd. of Elections, 580 U.S. 178, 187 (2017)—\nMr. Trende’s plans pack Black voters into a limited number of districts and “minimize their \ninfluence in the districts next door.” Johnson, 512 U.S. at 1007. The 2022 election outcomes \nconfirm that the Commission’s approach is at least as good if not better for Black voters. In \nthe Hickory plan, at least 14 candidates who were preferred by Detroit-area Black voters in \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 69,  PageID.657   Filed 05/09/23   Page 26 of 41\n \nboth primary (if applicable) and general elections prevailed in 2022. JA00011, 2023 Handley \nRep. 11. Under the Linden plan, at least five candidates who were preferred by Detroit-area \nblack voters in both primary (if applicable) and general elections prevailed. Id. Mr. Trende \nrepresented that the “whole thrust of the Voting Rights Act challenge here” is Plaintiffs’ con-\ntention that the Commission must “have ten districts” in the house “that will regularly elect \nthe minority candidate of choice” and five in the senate. JA00496, Trende Dep. 80:1–5. But \nthe indisputable evidence shows 14 Black-preferred-candidate wins in the house and five in \nthe senate, so the plans already do what Plaintiffs insist they must do. \nEven if Mr. Trende’s majority-minority districts were assumed to perform (without \nevidence), his demonstrative plans would still, at best, fall short of the Hickory plan and match \nthe Linden plan. There is no record evidence to the contrary. This is a case where “crossover \nvoting patterns and . . . effective crossover districts” are a defense to a Section 2 claim, Bartlett, \n556 U.S. at 24, because majority-minority districts can do no better and likely would fare \nworse for Black voters. Moreover, “States retain broad discretion in drawing districts to com-\nply with the mandate of § 2.” League of United Latin Am. Citizens v. Perry, 548 U.S. 399, 429 \n(2006) (plurality opinion) (citation omitted). On this record, with no possibility of showing \nmeaningful improvement, Plaintiffs have no room to challenge the Commission’s lawful dis-\ncretion in securing minority opportunity through crossover districts.  \n3.  All that aside, Plaintiffs cannot create a triable question of fact as to three dis-\ntricts they challenge, HD2, SD5, and SD11, because they cannot reasonably be redrawn as \nmajority-minority districts. As noted, a Section 2 plaintiff “must be able to demonstrate that \nit is sufficiently large and geographically compact to constitute a majority in a single-member \ndistrict.” Gingles, 478 U.S. at 50. That is, the group must, at a minimum, show that it could \nbe “a group concentrated within a hypothetical single-member district” to achieve at least a \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 69,  PageID.658   Filed 05/09/23   Page 27 of 41\n \nmajority of the VAP. Hall v. Virginia, 385 F.3d 421, 428–29 (4th Cir. 2004). That showing \ncannot be made as to HD2, SD5, and SD11. Each of these has a BVAP between 11% and \n19%, which is far from the majority-minority line. JA00578, JA00589, Commission Rep. 24, \n41. They cannot be reasonably reconfigured into a majority-minority districts, so any asser-\ntion of dilution would, at best, be targeted to neighboring districts. \nEach occupies territory that is not embraced by a majority-minority district in Mr. \nTrende’s demonstrative configurations. HD2 (11.04% BVAP) occupies territory redrawn by \nMr. Trende as HD11 (13.2% BVAP) and HD12 (11.6% BVAP). See JA00324–26, Trende \nRep. 17–19; JA00330–31, Trende Rep. 23–24; see also JA00429–30, Trende App’x C 12–13. \nMr. Trende’s report demonstrates that HD2 “cracks” no Black community. See JA00353, \nTrende Rep. 46.  \nSD5 (18.25% BVAP) primarily occupies territory redrawn by Mr. Trende as SD8 \n(8.88% BVAP) and SD7 (13.68% BVAP). See JA00327–29, Trende Rep. 20–22; JA00389–90, \nTrende Rep. 82–83; see also JA00432–35, Trende App’x C 67–68 & 70–71. While small por-\ntions of SD5 overlap with territory Mr. Trende reconfigures into majority-minority districts \n(demonstratives SD4 (50.01% BVAP) and SD5 (50.16% BVAP)), that area of overlap is not \nthe location of the compact Black communities grouped in those demonstrative districts, and \nSD5 does not “crack” any minority community. See JA00403, Trende Rep. 96. Districts \nneighboring SD5 to the east (SD1, SD2, and SD6) contain the BVAP supporting Mr. Trende’s \ndemonstrative majority-minority districts (SD4 and SD5). See id. JA00389, JA00403, Trende \nRep. 82, 96.  \nSD11 (19.19% BVAP) is anchored in Macomb County, which does not have a large \nconcentration of Black voting-age persons and is reconfigured in Mr. Trende’s plan primarily \nas SD12 (11.33%) and SD 13 (4.60%).

Although a small \nportion of SD11 is brought into Mr. Trende’s demonstrative SD1 (50.60% BVAP), that district \nis a redrawing of the Linden plan’s SD10 (40.4% BVAP), and Mr. Trende has not demon-\nstrated that, if SD10 is raised to more than 50% BVAP, as Plaintiffs demand, its neighbor \nSD11 could also cross that line. JA00389, JA00403, Trende Rep. 82, 96. No reasonable trier \nof fact could conclude that districts so far below the majority-minority line might reasonably \nbe reconfigured as majority-minority districts, and the Section 2 claims against these districts \npresent no triable fact question. \nC.  The Second and Third Gingles Preconditions \nPlaintiffs create no triable fact question as to 12 out of 17 challenged districts under \nthe second and third Gingles preconditions, which together relate to “racially polarized vot-\ning.” Gingles, 478 U.S. at 56. The second precondition asks “whether minority group members \nconstitute a politically cohesive unit,” and the third asks “whether whites vote sufficiently as \na bloc usually to defeat the minority’s preferred candidates.” Id. Each of these preconditions \nmust be independently shown as to each challenged district. See League of United Latin Am. \nCitizens v. Abbott, 604 F. Supp. 3d 463, 496 (W.D. Tex. 2022) (three-judge court) (“It bears \nemphasizing that each of these preconditions must be shown on a district-by-district basis.”); \nCousin v. Sundquist, 145 F.3d 818, 823 (6th Cir. 1998) (“[A] Section 2 claim cannot proceed \nunless all three Gingles pre-conditions are satisfied.”).  \nPlaintiffs’ record fails to create a triable question of fact as to the vast majority of chal-\nlenged districts. For districts HD1, HD7, HD10, HD12, HD13, HD14, SD3, and SD6, no \nevidence plausibly shows the third precondition, which requires proof that “a white bloc vote \nthat normally will defeat the combined strength of minority support plus white ‘crossover’ \nvotes.” Gingles, 478 U.S. at 56. In each district, the candidate all experts’ estimates identified \n22 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 69,  PageID.660   Filed 05/09/23   Page 29 of 41\n \nas Black preferred won the 2022 Democratic primary.10 JA00011, 2023 Handley Rep. 11; see \nalso JA00349, JA00396, Trende Rep. 42, 89. Plaintiffs cannot create a triable fact question on \nthe third precondition based solely on evidence of Black-preferred-candidate victories, since \nthat precondition requires them to prove that Black-preferred candidates usually lose. See Cano \nv. Davis, 211 F. Supp. 2d 1208, 1235 (C.D. Cal. 2002) (three-judge court), aff’d, 537 U.S. 1100 \n(2003) (granting summary judgment because all evidence showed “SD 27 is a district in which \nLatino candidates and other candidates preferred by Latino voters can win”). \nLikewise, for two districts, HD8 and HD11, there is no triable question under the sec-\nond precondition, which requires proof “that a significant number of minority group members \nusually vote for the same candidates.” Gingles, 478 U.S. at 56. Because “[p]olitical cohe-\nsion . . . implies that the group generally unites behind a single political ‘platform’ of common \ngoals,” this element is not established “if their votes are split among several different minority \ncandidates for the same office.” Levy v. Lexington Cnty., S.C., 589 F.3d 708, 720 (4th Cir. 2009) \n(citation omitted). The 2022 Democratic primary contests in HD8 and HD11 were fractured, \nwith five candidates in HD8 and nine in HD11. All expert analysis shows that not even a \nclear plurality of the minority community supported a single candidate. JA00012–13, 2023 \nHandley Rep. 12–13; see also JA00349, Trende Rep. 42. In HD8, Dr. Handley reports that the \ntop two choices of Black voters “each receiv[ed] about 32% of the Black vote,” with the elec-\ntion’s winner receiving “slightly less than 25% of the Black vote.” JA00012, 2023 Handley \nRep. 12. In HD11, “Black voters primarily spread their votes across four candidates,” with \n \n10 Plaintiffs assert that only primary elections are relevant to Section 2 claims. That is legally \nincorrect. See Gingles, 478 U.S. at 52–53, 80 (looking to both primary and general elections); \nLewis v. Alamance Cnty., N.C., 99 F.3d 600, 614–16 (4th Cir. 1996) (rejecting the argument \n“that Democrats should be treated as black-preferred only if they were also black-preferred in \nthe primary election”). But to demonstrate clearly the absence of any material fact dispute, \nthe Commission assumes only primary election results are relevant for the purpose of this \nsection of this motion only. \n23 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 69,  PageID.661   Filed 05/09/23   Page 30 of 41\n \nsupport levels of 24.2%, 22.2%, 18.7%, and 17.1%, respectively. JA00013, 2023 Handley Rep. \n13. A racial group is considered cohesive only if a “significant number of [its] members usu-\nally vote for the same candidates.” Gingles, 478 U.S. at 31. A fracturing of Black voters among \nmultiple candidates, as occurred in these two districts, falls short of the mark, even if Black \nvoters do not prefer a candidate or candidates preferred by white voters, Levy, 589 F.3d at 720 \n(quoting Monroe v. City of Woodville, Miss., 881 F.2d 1327, 1332 (5th Cir.1989)).  \nFor two other districts, SD10 and SD11, there is no evidence supporting Plaintiffs’ \nclaims on either polarization factor. In SD10, no Democratic primary occurred in 2022, and \na Democratic candidate prevailed in the general election. JA00396, Trende Rep. 89. Mr. \nTrende acknowledges that Democratic candidates are Black-preferred, so even assuming gen-\neral elections are irrelevant, no evidence could prove the second or third preconditions. Like-\nwise, Mr. Trende omitted any analysis of polarization of SD11 from his report, and Dr. \nPalmer’s analysis of Mr. Trende’s data likewise shows that SD11 was not polarized in 2022 \nbecause, when taking into account statistical uncertainty, there was not evidence that a ma-\njority of Black voters supported the same candidate. JA00134, Palmer Rep. ¶ 47. With no \nevidence at all, Plaintiffs cannot create a triable fact question on either the second or third \npreconditions. “Section 2 ‘does not assume the existence of racial bloc voting; plaintiffs must \nprove it.’” Growe v. Emison, 507 U.S. 25, 42 (1993) (citation omitted). \nIII.  Plaintiffs’ Racial-Gerrymandering Claims Fail as a Matter of Law \nSummary judgment is warranted on the racial-gerrymandering claims (Counts III and \nIV). See Compl. ¶¶ 181–212, PageID.143–51. The challenged districts do not violate the Equal \nProtection Clause, and no trial is necessary to see why that is so.  \n24 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 69,  PageID.662   Filed 05/09/23   Page 31 of 41\n \nA.  The Legal Standard \n“The Equal Protection Clause prohibits a State, without sufficient justification, from \n‘separating its citizens into different voting districts on the basis of race.’” Bethune-Hill, 580 \nU.S. at 187 (citation and edit marks omitted). However, “redistricting differs from other kinds \nof state decisionmaking in that the legislature always is aware of race when it draws district \nlines.” Shaw I, 509 U.S. at 646. The “evidentiary difficulty” of distinguishing awareness from \npurpose, “together with the sensitive nature of redistricting and the presumption of good faith \nthat must be accorded legislative enactments, requires courts to exercise extraordinary caution \nin adjudicating claims that a State has drawn district lines on the basis of race.” Miller v. John-\nson, 515 U.S. 900, 916 (1995). \nAccordingly, it is the “plaintiff’s burden . . . to show . . . that race was the predominant \nfactor motivating the legislature’s decision to place a significant number of voters within or \nwithout a particular district.” Id. “Race must not simply have been a motivation for the draw-\ning of a majority-minority district, but the predominant factor motivating the legislature’s dis-\ntricting decision.” Easley v. Cromartie, 532 U.S. 234, 241 (2001) (Cromartie II) (internal citations \nand quotation marks omitted). This is a “demanding” standard, id., that “applies district-by-\ndistrict,” Alabama Legislative Black Caucus, 575 U.S. at 262. “Where a challenger succeeds in \nestablishing racial predominance, the burden shifts to the State to ‘demonstrate that its dis-\ntricting legislation is narrowly tailored to achieve a compelling interest.’” Bethune-Hill, 580 \nU.S. at 193 (quoting Miller, 515 U.S. at 920), which includes “complying with operative pro-\nvisions of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.” Cooper, 581 U.S. at 292; accord Abbott, 138 S. Ct. at \n2315. \nA racial-gerrymandering claim is “analytically distinct” from a vote dilution claim. \nShaw I, 509 U.S. at 652. The vote-dilution question is whether an electoral scheme enables \n25 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 69,  PageID.663   Filed 05/09/23   Page 32 of 41\n \n“white bloc voting” to “‘minimize or cancel’ black voters’ ability to elect representatives of \ntheir choice.” Gingles, 478 U.S. at 56 (internal citation omitted). The question in a racial-\ngerrymandering claim, by contrast, is whether a “racial classification[]” was utilized and, if \nso, whether that classification is “benign” because it “satisfies strict scrutiny.” Shaw I, 509 \nU.S. at 653. The racial-gerrymandering doctrine therefore turns on whether a redistricting \nauthority has “good reasons to believe” the use of race is “required,” not whether the actions \nwere actually “necessary for statutory compliance.” Alabama Legislative Black Caucus, 575 U.S. \nat 278. \nB.  Predominance \nPlaintiffs cannot create a triable question under the threshold predominance standard. \nSee Miller, 515 U.S. at 916. \n1.  Plaintiffs have admitted that the Commission’s political considerations were its \npredominant motive for creating the challenged districts, and this admission precludes a find-\ning that race predominated. In racial-gerrymandering cases, “[c]aution is especially appropri-\nate . . . where the State has articulated a legitimate political explanation for its districting de-\ncision, and the voting population is one in which race and political affiliation are highly cor-\nrelated.” Cromartie II, 532 U.S. at 242. In such cases, it is the challenger’s burden to prove \n“that race rather than politics predominantly explains” each challenged district’s “bounda-\nries.” Id. at 243. \nHere, the Commission offers a legitimate political explanation for the challenged dis-\ntricts’ boundaries. The Michigan Constitution provides that “[d]istricts shall not provide a \ndisproportionate advantage to any political party,” as “determined using accepted measures \nof partisan fairness.” Mich. Const. art. 4, § 6(13)(d). The Commission interpreted this provi-\nsion to demand an effort to avoid a partisan effect favoring either major party. And it faced a \n26 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 69,  PageID.664   Filed 05/09/23   Page 33 of 41\n \ndistinct challenge because Democratic constituents are concentrated in a few cities; to create \ndistricts with high levels of Democratic constituents in the Detroit metropolitan area would \ndilute statewide Democratic voting strength under accepted partisan-fairness measures.11 \nJA232–37, Rodden Rep. 6–11. The parties agree that Black voters support Democratic can-\ndidates at high levels, so this is a case where “race and political affiliation are highly corre-\nlated.” Cromartie II, 532 U.S. at 242. \nThe Complaint alleges that the Commission removed Black voters from the challenged \ndistricts  for  predominantly  racial  reasons,  see,  e.g.,  Compl.  ¶¶ 66,  72,  PageID.113, \nPageID.116, but “politics is as good an explanation as is race for the district[s’] boundaries.” \nCromartie II, 532 U.S. at 252. As the Commission’s expert Dr. Rodden demonstrates, it is \nequally plausible that the comparative reduction of BVAP as measured by the 2011 plans \nresulted from the Commission’s obligation to avoid concentrating Democratic supporters into \na few districts and otherwise dilute their voting strength statewide. See JA00237, Rodden Rep. \n16. As a result, the difference in racial demographics between the Linden and Hickory plans, \non the one hand, and other comparators Plaintiffs cite (such as the 2011 plans and plans sim-\nulated by their expert, Mr. Trende), on the other hand, does not show that race rather than \npolitics predominated. JA00242–59, JA00263–67, Rodden Rep. 16–33, 37–41. \nPlaintiffs have made a binding judicial admission that politics predominated, and that \nforecloses any fact dispute on this question. In response to requests to admit the Commission \npropounded, Plaintiffs stated: “it appears inescapable that the Commission’s primary motiva-\ntion was to increase the number of Democratic-majority districts at the expense of Detroit-\narea Black voters.” JA00547–48, Pls.’ Objs. & Responses to RFA No. 8. By this admission, \nthe fact that politics predominated “is conclusively established.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 36(b). This \n \n11 Indeed, the Commission was accused of doing too little to even the proverbial playing field \nfor Democratic Party interests. See League of Women Voters, 509 Mich. 885, 971 N.W.2d 595. \n27 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 69,  PageID.665   Filed 05/09/23   Page 34 of 41\n \nadmission compels summary judgment on the racial-gerrymandering claims. See Tillamook \nCountry Smoker, Inc. v. Tillamook Cnty. Creamery Ass’n., 333 F. Supp. 2d 975, 983–84 (D. Or. \n2004), aff’d, 465 F.3d 1102 (9th Cir. 2006) (summary judgment warranted where binding ad-\nmission forecloses fact dispute on dispositive question). \n2.  At a minimum, there is no evidence of racial predominance as to HD2, SD5, \nand SD11. As discussed, these districts have respective BVAPs of 11.04%, 18.25%, and \n19.19%. JA00578, Commission Rep. 24; JA00589, Commission Rep. 41. But Plaintiffs’ the-\nory is that the Commission “intentionally lowered BVAP by placing Black voters in Districts \nwhere it is predicted that the District majority will vote for the Black voter candidate of \nchoice,” based on “white crossover voting.” Compl. ¶ 86, PageID.121. Dr. Handley did not \npredict that any districts would perform as crossover districts at BVAPs of less than 20%, and \nthere is no evidence that the Commission purposefully configured any districts below 20% \nBVAP for any racial reasons, let alone predominantly racial reasons. Accordingly, there is no \ntriable question of fact related to these districts. \nC.  Narrow Tailoring \nEven if race were presumed to predominate in some or all challenged districts, they \nwould not violate the Equal Protection Clause because the Commission’s racial considera-\ntions were narrowly tailored to the compelling interest of VRA compliance. Because the VRA \n“obviously demand[s] consideration of race,” the Supreme Court has assumed “that compli-\nance with the VRA may justify the consideration of race in a way that would not otherwise \nbe allowed.” Abbott, 138 S. Ct. at 2315; see Bethune-Hill, 580 U.S. at 193 (rejecting challenge \nto district that was narrowly tailored to VRA compliance). The Supreme Court has recognized \nthat “[t]he law cannot lay a trap for an unwary legislature” and holds that “the narrow tailor-\ning requirement insists only that the legislature have a ‘strong basis in evidence’ in support of \n28 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 69,  PageID.666   Filed 05/09/23   Page 35 of 41\n \nthe (race-based) choice that it has made.” Alabama Legislative Black Caucus, 575 U.S. at 278 \n(citation omitted). “[T]he requisite strong basis in evidence exists when the legislature has \n‘good reasons to believe’ it must use race in order to satisfy the Voting Rights Act, ‘even if a \ncourt does not find that the actions were necessary for statutory compliance.’” Bethune-Hill, \n580 U.S. at 194 (quoting Alabama Legislative Black Caucus, 575 U.S. at 278). This inquiry is \nmade based on the record before the redistricting authority at the time of redistricting. See \nCooper, 581 U.S. at 302–03; Covington v. North Carolina, 316 F.R.D. 117, 166–67 (M.D.N.C. \n2016) (three-judge court), aff’d, 137 S. Ct. 2211 (2017). \n1.  There can be no doubt that the Commission had a compelling interest in VRA \ncompliance. A compelling interest exists under Section 2 if the redistricting authority “has \ngood reason to think that all the ‘Gingles preconditions’ are met.” Cooper, 581 U.S. at 302.  \nThe Commission had good reasons to conclude this. First, it understood that the Black \npopulation of the Detroit metropolitan region “is heavily concentrated in the Metro Detroit \narea, particularly in western Detroit, southern Wayne County, and around Pontiac.” Compl. \n¶ 78, PageID.119. It is undisputed that many majority-minority districts can be created in this \nregion in house and senate plans. See JA00329, JA00388–89, Trende Rep. 22, 81–82. Second, \nthe Commission had good reasons to believe the second and third Gingles preconditions could \nbe met from the expert report of Dr. Handley, who concluded that Detroit-area voting exhibits \nsufficient racial polarization that white bloc voting would usually defeat Black-preferred can-\ndidates in the absence of districts drawn to ensure equal Black opportunity. JA00041, 2021 \nHandley Rep. 17; see also JA00566, Sept. 2, 2021 Tr. 24. Mr. Trende testified that he has \nlocated no inaccuracies or errors in Dr. Handley’s analysis. JA00493–95, JA00498–99, \nTrende Dep. 60:6–15, 61:4–9, 61:16–62:1, 140:16–141:3. Finally, although the Supreme \nCourt has not identified it as a strict requirement, the Commission also had good reasons to \n29 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 69,  PageID.667   Filed 05/09/23   Page 36 of 41\n \nbelieve a Section 2 claim could be made out under the totality of the circumstances, as its \nattorney, Bruce Adelson, presented a memorandum establishing ongoing effects of past dis-\ncrimination. JA00438, Adelson Rep. Plaintiffs’ expert, Dr. Lockerbie, endorses that report. \nJA00473–74, Lockerbie Dep. 36:20–37:20. \n2.  There is no triable question on the narrow-tailoring inquiry. The Commission \nensured that BVAPs in Detroit-area districts were neither too low, such that the Black vote \nwould be “cracked” across districts, nor too high, such that it would be “packed” into a few \ndistricts. Gingles, 478 U.S. at 46 n.11. Its data-driven approach may be the most thorough and \nprecise a federal court has ever seen in any redistricting case. \nA redistricting authority’s use of race is narrowly tailored if it adheres to “a functional \nanalysis of the electoral behavior within the particular election district.” Bethune-Hill, 580 U.S. \nat 194 (citation and edit marks omitted). The Commission, in reliance on its advisors, con-\nducted and adhered to “a District specific functional analysis in each area.” JA00567, Sept. \n2, 2021 Tr. 25; see JA00569, Sept. 2, 2021 Tr. 29 (Adelson). To avoid the twin evils of cracking \nand packing, the Commission relied on Dr. Handley’s exhaustive analysis, which examined \nlevels of minority turnout, minority cohesion, and white crossover voting. The challenged \ndistricts’ BVAPs fall near or above the ranges Dr. Handley identified as sufficient to ensure \nequal electoral opportunity, JA00326, JA00329, Trende Rep. 19, 22, and Plaintiffs in fact \nalleged this, see Compl. ¶¶ 76–86, PageID.119–21. The Commission’s basis in evidence was \nconsiderably more robust than the approach approved in Bethune-Hill, where the Supreme \nCourt upheld a district based on legislative discussions about the BVAP need it needed to \npreserve minority opportunity, even though “that analysis was not memorialized in writing” \nand involved no data analysis. 580 U.S. at 195; see also id. at 194–96. \n30 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 69,  PageID.668   Filed 05/09/23   Page 37 of 41\n \nThere is no room for a material fact dispute. Although Plaintiffs advocate majority-\nminority districts, see Compl. ¶¶ 88–89, PageID.122, they present no functional analysis \ndemonstrating that they are necessary. Instead, they “mechanically rely upon numerical per-\ncentages,” which the Supreme Court condemned in Alabama Legislative Black Caucus, 575 U.S. \nat 277. Moreover, Plaintiffs’ expert, Mr. Trende, has no material quarrel with Dr.  Handley’s \npolarized voting analysis. His analysis is “just replicating what Dr. Handley did.” JA00497, \nTrende Dep. 131:10–11. Even if Mr. Trende disagrees with Dr. Handley’s conclusion that “in \nno county is a 50% BVAP district required for the Black-preferred candidates to carry the \ndistrict in a general election,” JA00045, 2021 Handley Rep. 21, such a dispute would not \nspeak to whether the Commission had “good reasons” for its choice “under these circum-\nstances,” Bethune-Hill, 580 U.S. at 196. The narrow tailoring analysis does not require a redis-\ntricting authority to “determine precisely what percent minority population” a district needs to \nperform. Id. at 195 (citation omitted). There would, then, be no purpose for a trial to decide \nthat question. To second guess it at this time, on this record, would “ask too much from state \nofficials charged with the sensitive duty of reapportioning legislative districts.” Id. If the Com-\nmission cannot satisfy strict scrutiny while relying on a gold-standard analysis of a renowned \nexpert, it is hard to see how any redistricting authority could ever satisfy that standard. But see \nBethune-Hill, 580 U.S. at 194–96 (finding that standard satisfied). \n3.  Plaintiffs’ quarrels with the Commission are legal, not factual. They appear to \nbelieve that, once the Commission had a strong basis to avoid Section 2 liability, it had to \nutilize majority-minority districts toward that end. That view is incorrect. \nThe Supreme Court rejected Plaintiffs’ position in Cooper, where it invalidated a ma-\njority-minority congressional district because the legislature that enacted it failed to consider \na “pattern of white crossover voting in the area.” 581 U.S. at 304. The Court observed that \n31 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 69,  PageID.669   Filed 05/09/23   Page 38 of 41\n \n“in five successive general elections” in the prior decade’s district, which was “around 48% \nBVAP,” “the candidates preferred by most African–American voters won their contests.” Id. \nat 294. That crossover-voting pattern mattered because only “a white bloc vote that normally \nwill defeat the combined strength of minority support plus white ‘crossover’ votes rises to the level \nof legally significant white bloc voting.” Gingles, 478 U.S. at 56 (emphasis added). Where \nwhite crossover voting permits a minority group an equal opportunity to elect its preferred \ncandidates at a given level of the voting-age population, the district creating that opportunity \nsatisfies Section 2, even if it is not a majority-minority district, Bartlett, 556 U.S. at 24, because \nwhite bloc voting in that instances does not usually prevent the election of minority-preferred \ncandidates, Gingles, 478 U.S. at 56. A redistricting authority therefore must evaluate white \ncrossover voting to ascertain whether a majority-minority district is tailored to secure equal \nopportunity (and thus to avoid unjustified racial classifications). To unnecessarily create or \nmaintain majority-minority districts violates the Equal Protection Clause rather than vindi-\ncates it. See Jacksonville Branch of NAACP v. City of Jacksonville, 3:22-cv-493, 2022 WL 7089087, \nat *9–48 (M.D. Fla. Oct. 12, 2022), appeal dismissed, 2023 WL 2966338 (11th Cir. Jan. 12, \n2023) (enjoining redistricting plan drawn to maintain prior packed minority districts). \nIn Cooper, crossover voting would facilitate equal Black opportunity at less than a nu-\nmerical BVAP majority, so the legislature’s majority-minority district was not narrowly tai-\nlored. 581 U.S. at 303–05. The Supreme Court recognized that, in Bartlett, it held that only \ngroups sufficiently numerous and compact to constitute numerical voting-age population ma-\njorities are entitled to Section 2 protection. Id. at 305 (discussing Bartlett, 556 U.S. at 8). But \nthe Court in Cooper clarified that Section 2 may nonetheless be “satisfied by crossover districts,” \nsuch that creating majority-minority districts is unnecessary and, by consequence, not nar-\nrowly tailored to Section 2 compliance. Id. Subsequently, the Supreme Court affirmed a three-\n32 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 69,  PageID.670   Filed 05/09/23   Page 39 of 41\n \njudge trial court’s decision invalidating more than 30 majority-minority districts on the \nground that the legislature failed to consider “the differing levels of non-African-American \ncrossover voting” to assess whether majority-BVAP districts were necessary. Covington, 316 \nF.R.D. at 171. \nThis case presents the Cooper and Covington fact pattern, but the roles are reversed. \nHere, the Commission undertook the analyses the legislatures in Cooper and Covington failed \nto undertake, and it configured districts according to observed voting patterns. That is pre-\ncisely the “functional analysis” Supreme Court precedent demands. Bethune-Hill, 580 U.S. at \n801. By contrast, Plaintiffs present no functional analysis. They insist that 50% BVAP should \nhave been the Commission’s floor even though no evidence supports it, and the Commission \nwas advised—based on a report not challenged here—that majority-minority districts are un-\nnecessary. Plaintiffs demand the very “mechanically numerical view” Supreme Court prece-\ndent rejects, Alabama Legislative Black Caucus, 575 U.S. at 277, under the very circumstances \nwhere Supreme Court precedent holds that majority-minority districts are racial gerryman-\nders, Cooper, 581 U.S. at 305; Covington, 316 F.R.D. at 171. Plaintiffs are on the wrong side of \nthis narrow-tailoring debate. Had the Commission done what Plaintiffs demand, then its \nchoices would not have been narrowly tailored.  \nIn short, Plaintiffs asks this Court to force the Commission into the very “legal mis-\ntake” condemned in Cooper. 581 U.S. at 306. Their position, in effect, is that “whenever a \nlegislature can draw a majority-minority district, it must do so—even if a crossover district \nwould also allow the minority group to elect its favored candidates.” Id. at 305. The argument \nfares no better here than in Cooper and Covington. Plaintiffs cannot credibly demand racial \ngerrymandering through the vehicle of a racial-gerrymandering claim. \n33 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 69,  PageID.671   Filed 05/09/23   Page 40 of 41\n \nCONCLUSION \nThe Court should grant summary judgment in the Commission’s favor and dismiss \nPlaintiffs’ claims. \n   \nDated: May 9, 2023  Respectfully submitted, \n/s/ David H.

Twenty Michigan voters sued Michigan’s Secretary of State \nand the Michigan Independent Citizens Redistricting Commission, claiming that Michigan’s \nlegislative districts had been racially gerrymandered.  The plaintiffs argue that these districts \nviolate the Constitution’s Equal Protection Clause and Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, 52 \nU.S.C. § 10301.  The parties have filed cross-motions for summary judgment.  We deny the \nplaintiffs’ motion and grant the Commission’s motion in part.   \nI. \nA. \nOnce every decade, states must redraw their electoral districts “to account for any changes \nor shifts in population.”  Georgia v. Ashcroft, 539 U.S. 461, 489 n.2 (2003).  State legislatures \nhave long used that process to consolidate partisan power.  See Rucho v. Common Cause, 139 S. \nCt. 2484, 2495 (2019).  Until recently, Michigan was no exception.  In November 2018, however, \nMichigan voters approved a state constitutional amendment that shifted the power to draw state \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 81,  PageID.2030   Filed 08/29/23   Page 2 of 16\nlegislative  districts  from  the  legislature  to  the  Michigan  Independent  Citizens  Redistricting \nCommission.  Mich. Const. art. IV, § 6.  As amended, the Michigan Constitution required the \nCommission to “abide by the following criteria in proposing and adopting” new redistricting plans, \n“in order of priority:” \n(a) Districts  shall  be  of  equal  population  as  mandated  by  the  United  States \nconstitution, and shall comply with the voting rights act and other federal laws. \n(b) Districts shall be geographically contiguous. Island areas are considered to be \ncontiguous by land to the county of which they are a part. \n(c) Districts shall reflect the state’s diverse population and communities of interest. \nCommunities of interest may include, but shall not be limited to, populations \nthat  share  cultural  or  historical  characteristics  or  economic  interests. \nCommunities of interest do not include relationships with political parties, \nincumbents, or political candidates. \n(d) Districts shall not provide a disproportionate advantage to any political party. \nA disproportionate advantage to a political party shall be determined using \naccepted measures of partisan fairness. \n(e) Districts shall not favor or disfavor an incumbent elected official or a candidate. \n(f) Districts shall reflect consideration of county, city, and township boundaries. \n(g) Districts shall be reasonably compact. \nMich. Const. art. IV, § 6(13). \nSecretary of State Jocelyn Benson formed the new Commission by randomly selecting 13 \ncandidates—four Democrats, four Republicans, and five independents—out of a group of qualified \napplicants.  The Commission thereafter began holding public meetings to solicit community input.  \nIn late 2020, the Commission began drafting new redistricting plans.   \nIn doing so, the Commission retained a Voting Rights Act expert, Dr. Lisa Handley, and a \nvoting-rights attorney, Bruce Adelson.  Handley concluded that voting in Michigan was racially \npolarized—meaning that white and black voters tend to support different candidates—and advised \nthe Commission to create so-called “opportunity districts” in which minority voters could elect \ntheir candidates of choice.  Whether minority voters can do so, in districts with mostly Democratic \nvoters,  depends  on  whether  candidates  favored  by  minority  voters  prevail  in  the  primary \nelections—because in such districts the Democratic nominee will very likely win the general.   \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 81,  PageID.2031   Filed 08/29/23   Page 3 of 16\n  The Commission eventually adopted the “Hickory Map” for the state house, and the \n“Linden Map” for the state senate.  These maps reconfigured Detroit-area districts to include voters \nfrom the suburban counties—thereby lowering the percentage of black voters in those districts to \n35-55%.  In the old map, by contrast, the black voting-age population in some districts in Detroit \nexceeded 90%.   \nAccording to the Commission and its experts, the proposed maps scored substantially better \nthan the old plans on accepted measures of partisan fairness.  But they also reduced the number of \nmajority-black districts (“majority-minority” districts) from eleven to seven for the state house, \nand from two to zero for the senate.   \n  In 2022, a group of black voters, including some of the current plaintiffs, brought suit in \nthe Michigan Supreme Court, alleging violations of the Voting Rights Act.  They argued that the \nHickory and Linden maps had diminished the ability of black voters to elect their candidates of \nchoice in the Democratic primaries.  See Detroit Caucus v. Indep. Citizens Redistricting Comm’n, \n969 N.W.2d 331, 332 (Mich. 2022).  The court disagreed and dismissed the case.  Id.   \nThe plaintiffs in this case—Detroit-area black voters who vote in Democratic primary \nelections—then filed this federal suit against the Commission and Secretary of State Jocelyn \nBenson.  They likewise claim that ten Detroit-area House Districts—namely, House Districts 1, 2, \n7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 26—and seven Detroit-area Senate Districts—namely, Senate Districts \n1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 10, 11—violate the Voting Rights Act and the Equal Protection Clause.  Before us are \nthe plaintiffs’ and the Commission’s cross-motions for summary judgment.  Secretary Benson \ntakes no position as to the merits of plaintiffs’ claims; but she requests that, as to any claim on \nwhich the Commission is granted summary judgment, she be granted the same.   \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 81,  PageID.2032   Filed 08/29/23   Page 4 of 16\nII. \n  “Summary judgment is appropriate only when there is no genuine issue of material fact \nand the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.”  Tlapanco v. Elges, 969 F.3d 638, \n646 (6th Cir. 2020).   \nA. \n1.  \n  As an initial matter, the Commission argues that none of the plaintiffs has standing to assert \na claim against House District 13.  Voting-rights injuries are “district specific,” so individual voters \nhave standing to challenge only the district in which they live.  Gill v. Whitford, 138 S. Ct. 1916, \n1930 (2017).   Moreover, “plaintiffs must maintain their personal interest in the dispute at all stages \nof litigation.”  See TransUnion LLC v. Ramirez, 141 S. Ct. 2190, 2208 (2021).  Here, two plaintiffs \nlived in House District 13 when the complaint was filed, but both have since moved to other \ndistricts.  Their challenge against their former district is therefore moot.  Id.  And no other plaintiff \ncan assert any injury resulting from House District 13.  Gill, 138 S. Ct. at 1930.  Thus, as plaintiffs \nconceded at oral argument, we lack jurisdiction over any claims involving that district.  \nRelatedly, plaintiffs seek leave to amend their complaint to replace their challenge against \nDistrict 13 with claims related to District 9 (to which one of the former District 13 plaintiffs has \nmoved).  But plaintiffs’ asserted injury is a lack of majority-minority districts—and District 9 \nalready is such a district.  Nor have the plaintiffs explained what other claims they would seek to \nassert.  We therefore deny the motion to amend.  See Courie v. Alcoa Wheel & Forged Prod.’s, \n577 F.3d 625, 633 (6th Cir. 2009). \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 81,  PageID.2033   Filed 08/29/23   Page 5 of 16\n2. \nThe Commission next argues that res judicata bars plaintiffs’ claims as to House District \n26 and Senate District 5—because, it says, the Michigan Supreme Court finally decided those \nclaims in Detroit Caucus.   \nFederal courts must afford a state judgment “the same preclusive effect that the judgment \nwould have in state court.”  In re Fordu, 201 F.3d 693, 703 (6th Cir. 1999); 28 U.S.C. § 1738.  In \nMichigan, res judicata bars a second action “when (1) the prior action was decided on the merits, \n(2) both actions involve the same parties or their privies, and (3) the matter in the second case was, \nor could have been, resolved in the first.”  Adair v. State, 680 N.W.2d 386, 396 (Mich. 2004). \nHere, plaintiffs concede that—as to these two districts—the parties in this suit are the same \nas in Detroit Caucus.  And the earlier case concerned the same Voting Rights Act (VRA) claim \nthat plaintiffs assert here.  See Detroit Caucus, 969 N.W.2d at 331.  Moreover, though plaintiffs \ndid not bring their equal-protection claim in state court, they plainly could have, since that claim \nrelies on the same set of facts as their VRA claim.  Adair, 680 N.W.2d at 396–98.  Thus, the only \nquestion here is whether the Michigan Supreme Court decided that case “on the merits.”  Id. at \n396. \nPlaintiffs argue that the Michigan Supreme Court “declined to address the merits of the \nDetroit Caucus’s sole VRA claim.”  We disagree: the Michigan Supreme Court expressly rejected \nplaintiffs’ claims on the merits when it decided “that plaintiffs have not made the threshold \nshowing of white bloc voting required by Gingles.”  Detroit Caucus, 969 N.W.2d at 333.    \n  Plaintiffs relatedly argue that the Michigan Supreme Court’s decision did not satisfy “the \nminimum procedural requirements of the Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process Clause.”  Kremer \nv. Chem. Constr. Corp., 456 U.S. 461, 481 (1982).  In support, however, plaintiffs assert only that \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 81,  PageID.2034   Filed 08/29/23   Page 6 of 16\nthe court should have permitted discovery.  But the plaintiffs themselves conceded in Detroit \nCaucus that “further factual development is unnecessary for resolution of the case.”  Detroit \nCaucus, 969 N.W.2d at 334.  They cannot argue now that such development was constitutionally \nrequired.   Res judicata bars their challenges to House District 26 and Senate District 5.   \nB. \nThat leaves claims against House Districts 1, 2, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, and 14, and Senate Districts \n1, 3, 6, 8, 10 and 11.  Plaintiffs challenge those districts under section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, \narguing that the district boundaries prevent them from electing their candidates of choice during \nthe Democratic primary elections.  \nSection 2 protects minority voters from “electoral structure[s]” that “minimize or cancel \nout [their] ability to elect their preferred candidates.”  Gingles, 478 U.S. at 48; Allen v. Milligan, \n143 S. Ct. 1487, 1503 (2023).  As the Supreme Court recently reiterated, plaintiffs must establish \nthree “preconditions” to prove a section 2 claim: \nFirst, the minority group must be sufficiently large and geographically compact to \nconstitute  a  majority  in  a  reasonably  configured  district.  A  district  will  be \nreasonably configured, our cases explain, if it comports with traditional districting \ncriteria, such as being contiguous and reasonably compact. Second, the minority \ngroup must be able to show that it is politically cohesive. And third, the minority \nmust be able to demonstrate that the white majority votes sufficiently as a bloc to \nenable it to defeat the minority's preferred candidate. \nAllen, 143 S. Ct. at 1503 (cleaned up).  Plaintiffs who establish all three preconditions must also \nshow that, “under the totality of the circumstances,” the challenged district or political process “is \nnot equally open to minority voters.”  Id. \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 81,  PageID.2035   Filed 08/29/23   Page 7 of 16\n1.  \n  To establish the first precondition, each plaintiff need only show that he or she could be \nplaced in a “reasonably configured district” in which a majority of the voting-age population is \nblack.  See id.; Bartlett v. Strickland, 556 U.S. 1, 18 (2009).   \na. \n  Plaintiffs argue they are entitled to summary judgment as to the first precondition.  That \ncondition would seem relatively easy to meet here: the plaintiffs are Detroit-area voters, and \nDetroit’s voting-age population is significantly more than 50% African-American.  Yet plaintiffs’ \nexpert, Sean Trende, does not explain whether his proposed map would place each plaintiff in a \nmajority-minority district.  Rather, Trende shows only that his proposed maps would include more \nmajority-minority districts than the Commission’s map does.  That is not enough to establish the \nfirst condition as a matter of law.  See Gill, 139 S. Ct. at 1930; Bartlett, 556 U.S. at 18.   \nNor have the plaintiffs yet shown that their expert’s proposed districts are “reasonably \nconfigured.”  Specifically, they point to no  evidence that their proposed map accounts for \ncommunities of interest, partisan fairness, or the effect on incumbents.  See Mich. Const. Art. IV, \n§ 6(13)(c), (d), (e).  Thus, plaintiffs are not entitled to summary judgment on this precondition. \nb. \n  The Commission, for its part, argues that it is entitled to summary judgment as to this \nprecondition on two grounds.  The first would apply to every district at issue here.  Specifically, \nthe Commission argues that the plaintiffs must show not only that they could be placed in a \nreasonably configured majority-minority district, but also that the plaintiffs’ proposed districts \nwould afford black voters a better chance to elect their candidates of choice than the current \ndistricts do.  But that argument collapses the ultimate question in a section 2 case—vote dilution—\n7 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 81,  PageID.2036   Filed 08/29/23   Page 8 of 16\ninto the first precondition of the plaintiffs’ claim.   See Gingles, 478 U.S. at 51; Perez, 138 S. Ct. \nat 2332; Milligan, 143 S. Ct. at 1503.  And the Supreme Court’s definition of the showing required \nfor a section 2 claim could hardly be clearer.  Milligan, 143 S. Ct. at 1503.  The first precondition \nis simply that: plaintiffs need only show that they could be placed in a reasonably configured \nmajority-minority district.  The Commission’s argument is meritless.  \nThe Commission also argues that House District 2 and Senate District 11 cannot be \nreasonably reconfigured into majority-minority districts because only a very small percentage of \ntheir voting-age population is black.  But Trende’s demonstrative maps would move plaintiff Gail \nLondon from Senate District 11 into a new Senate District 1—which would be 50.6% black.  See \nECF No. 76-3; ECF No. 71-1, PID1070; ECF No. 8, PID98.  Thus, London—like other black \nvoters in her community—could become a member of a majority-minority district.  That is enough \nfor her to proceed with her claim.  Cf. Gill, 139 S. Ct. at 1930.   \nConversely, plaintiffs cannot make out a claim against House District 2. Trende’s map \nwould move both plaintiffs in that district—Donald Agee and Davonte Sherard—into proposed \nDistrict 12, which would have a black voting-age population of 11.63%.  ECF No. 76-2; ECF No. \n71-1, PID1011; ECF No. 8, PID103.  Thus, the plaintiffs in House District 2 lack evidence creating \na  genuine  issue  as  to  whether  they  could  be  part  of  a  majority-minority  district,  and  the \nCommission is entitled to summary judgment as to that district.  \n2. \na. \n  The second precondition requires plaintiffs to establish that black voters in each challenged \ndistrict are politically cohesive—meaning they generally support the same candidate.  Gingles, \n478 U.S. at 51.  Plaintiffs seek summary judgment on this issue and assert, plausibly enough, that \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 81,  PageID.2037   Filed 08/29/23   Page 9 of 16\nblack voters around Detroit are politically cohesive as a general matter.  Yet the Supreme Court \nhas said again and again that courts must analyze section 2 claims district-by-district.  See, e.g., \nPerez, 138 S. Ct. at 2332 (“We have made clear that redistricting analysis must take place at the \ndistrict level”) (citations omitted); Wisconsin Legislature v. Wisconsin Elections Comm’n, 142 S. \nCt. 1245, 1250 (2022) (“Rather than carefully evaluating evidence at the district level, the court \nimproperly  relied  on  generalizations  to  reach  the  conclusion  that  the  preconditions  were \nsatisfied.”).  And for whatever reason, plaintiffs have made no attempt to prove political cohesion \ndistrict-by-district here.  \nInstead, plaintiffs rely on Handley’s report to the Commission, which concluded that \n“voting in Michigan is racially polarized.”  But that reliance is mistaken twice over.  First, \nHandley’s conclusion applied to voting in general elections, while plaintiffs’ challenge concerns \nvoting in the primaries.  Second, racial polarization is different from political cohesion.  A district \nis racially polarized when black and white voters tend to support different candidates.  That can \nhappen even where black voters are split between multiple candidates—and thus lack political \ncohesion.  See Levy v. Lexington Cnty., S.C., 589 F.3d 708, 720 (4th Cir. 2009).  Conversely, black \nand white voters alike might support the same candidate in a particular district—meaning the \ngroups are cohesive but not polarized.  Thus, plaintiffs cannot rely on polarization to show \ncohesion.  Plaintiffs have not established their entitlement to summary judgment as to this \nprecondition.  \nb. \n  Meanwhile, the Commission seeks summary judgment on this precondition only as to \nHouse Districts 8 and 11, and Senate Districts 10 and 11—arguing that plaintiffs lack evidence of \ncohesion there.   In the two house districts, the black vote was almost evenly split between two \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 81,  PageID.2038   Filed 08/29/23   Page 10 of 16\nprimary candidates during the 2022 elections.  Thus, in the only election conducted with the \nchallenged maps, black voters in those districts were not cohesive.  Nor does the 2022 election \nshow cohesion in either senate district: the incumbent ran unopposed in District 10, and plaintiffs \nprovide no evidence at all about District 11.  \n  Plaintiffs could have remedied this problem with analysis of prior election returns in the \nprecincts that now comprise these four districts, if those returns suggested that black voters’ lack \nof cohesion in 2022 was unusual.  But plaintiffs’ experts provide no such analysis here.  By way \nof example, what is now House District 8 occupies parts of former Districts 3, 7, 26, and 27.  \nTrende lists two election results for former Districts 3 and 7 without analyzing them, and does not \nmention former Districts 26 and 27.  This report therefore lacks a sufficient basis for any \nconclusions about past cohesion in those districts.  Trende’s analysis of House District 11 and \nSenate District 10 suffers from the same problems, and Senate District 11 is absent from his report \naltogether.  And a jury could not infer cohesion in these districts without expert analysis.   \n  Plaintiffs counter that white voters cohesively rejected black candidates of choice in these \ndistricts.  But that goes to the third precondition—white-bloc voting—rather than the second.  See \nGingles, 578 U.S. at 51 (“the minority group must be able to show that it is politically cohesive”) \n(emphasis added).  And plaintiffs’ anecdotal evidence of racial polarization in the Detroit area is \nnot meaningful evidence of cohesion in these districts.  Thus, as to these four districts, plaintiffs \nhave not offered any evidence from which a jury could infer cohesion.  The Commission is \ntherefore entitled to summary judgment as to House Districts 8 and 11 and Senate Districts 10 and \n11.  \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 81,  PageID.2039   Filed 08/29/23   Page 11 of 16\n3. \na. \n  The third precondition requires plaintiffs “to demonstrate that the white majority votes \nsufficiently as a bloc to enable it to defeat the minority’s preferred candidate.”  Milligan, 143 S. \nCt. at 1503 (cleaned up); see also Perez, 138 S. Ct. at 2330-31.  Whether plaintiffs can satisfy that \nprecondition is the core factual dispute in this case.  According to the Commission and its experts, \n“majority Black districts are not necessary to provide Black voters with an opportunity to elect \ntheir candidates of choice” in Democratic primaries—because, the Commission says, those black-\npreferred candidates enjoy substantial support from white voters.  ECF No. 71, PID692.  By \ncontrast, plaintiffs and their expert predict that—even in districts where the black candidate of \nchoice prevailed in 2022—support for black candidates of choice will decline precipitously in the \ncoming  years.    On  summary  judgment,  we  cannot  weigh  these  competing  opinions;  this \ndisagreement between the parties’ experts creates a genuine issue of material fact as to the degree \nof white cross-over voting in the remaining districts.  See Rodgers v. Monumental Life Ins. Co., \n289 F.3d 442, 449 (6th Cir. 2002).    \nb. \n  Nor can either party obtain summary judgment on this factor by focusing on only the last \nelection.  The Commission says that it is entitled to summary judgment as to every district where \nthe black candidate of choice prevailed in 2022.  But plaintiffs need only show that a white majority \nis “usually” able to defeat candidates supported by the black minority.  Gingles, 478 U.S. at 49.  \nAnd plaintiffs have offered expert evidence suggesting that, as incumbents retire, black candidates \nwill face greater difficulty being elected in the future.   \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 81,  PageID.2040   Filed 08/29/23   Page 12 of 16\nMeanwhile,  plaintiffs  seek  summary  judgment  as  to  every  district  where  the  black \ncandidate of choice lost in 2022.  They emphasize, correctly, that some of those election results \nsuggest a remarkably cohesive white majority—as in Senate District 8, where 96% of white voters \nsupported a candidate other than the black candidate of choice.  But a single election loss, even if \nstark, does not prove as a matter of law that the black candidate of choice will usually lose.  See \nGingles, 478 U.S. at 49.  And the Commission offers expert evidence here suggesting that the 2022 \nresult in Senate District 8 was anomalous.  See ECF No. 71, PID812.  Thus, neither side is entitled \nto summary judgment on this precondition. \n4. \nFor the plaintiffs to prevail on their section 2 claim, as noted above, they must also show \nthat, “under the totality of the circumstances, the district lines dilute the votes of the members of \nthe minority group.”  Perez, 138 S. Ct. at 2331.  That determination depends on a variety of \ncircumstances, such as any history of voting-related discrimination in the state, the effects of past \ndiscrimination, and the use of racial appeals in political campaigns.  See Gingles, 478 U.S. at 44-\n45; Johnson v. DeGrandy, 512 U.S. 997, 1101 n.9 (1994).  Plaintiffs seek summary judgment on \nthis issue as well; but we cannot evaluate the totality of the circumstances when genuine issues of \nmaterial fact remain as to each Gingles precondition.  See Milligan, 143 S. Ct. at 1503.  Thus, \nsummary judgment is inappropriate as to this issue.  \n  In sum, neither side is entitled to summary judgment on plaintiffs’ VRA claims as to House \nDistricts 1, 7, 10, 12, and 14, and Senate Districts 1, 3, 6, and 8.  Those claims should therefore \nproceed to trial. \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 81,  PageID.2041   Filed 08/29/23   Page 13 of 16\nC.  \n  Plaintiffs also challenge their districts on equal-protection grounds.  The Fourteenth \nAmendment’s Equal Protection Clause “limits racial gerrymanders in legislative redistricting \nplans.”  Cooper v. Harris, 581 U.S. 285, 291-92 (2017).  Here, to prove an unconstitutional racial \ngerrymander,  plaintiffs  must  prove  that  race  was  “the  predominant  factor”  in  drawing  the \nboundaries for their districts.  Id.  If plaintiffs prove that, the districts “cannot be upheld unless \nthey are narrowly tailored to achieving a compelling state interest.” Wisconsin Legislature, 142 S. \nCt. at 1248; see also Bethune-Hill v. Virginia State Bd. of Elections, 137 S. Ct. 788, 800 (2017).  \nMoreover, the parties must make these showings district-by-district.  Wisconsin Legislature, 142 \nS. Ct. at 1250. \n1. \n  Plaintiffs seek summary judgment on their equal-protection claims as to every district.  \nAccording to plaintiffs, the Commission established a 40% “ceiling” on districts’ black voting-age \npopulation.  As evidence, plaintiffs point to a dissenting report from Commissioner Szetala, who \nwrote that the Commission’s counsel had aggressively pushed the Commission “to reduce the \n[black voting-age population] numbers as close to the general election percentages (35% to 45%) \nas possible.”  ECF No. 71-3, PID1292.  At one meeting, Szetala says, counsel directed the \nCommission to “identify ‘anything that is higher than 40% for the black voting age population’” \nso that those districts could be “dealt with.”  Id. at PID1293. \n   Plaintiffs argue that Szetala’s dissent shows, as a matter of law, that race predominated in \nthe Commission’s redistricting decisions.  In fact, however, the Commission ultimately drew many \ndistricts with a black voting-age population greater than 40%—thirteen for the House, and four for \nthe Senate.  Thus, the record shows that the Commission did not implement a 40% racial ceiling \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 81,  PageID.2042   Filed 08/29/23   Page 14 of 16\nacross the map.  That does not make the Szetala dissent irrelevant to plaintiffs’ claims.  But it does \nmean that her dissent alone does not establish that race predominated when the Commission drew \nplaintiffs’ districts.  Nor, suffice it to say, do the opinions of plaintiffs’ experts entitle them to \nsummary judgment on their equal-protection claims.  \n2.  \na. \n  As to these same claims, the Commission seeks summary judgment on several grounds.  \nThe Commission argues, first, that plaintiffs conceded race did not predominate when they \nadmitted, during discovery, that “the Commission’s primary motivation was to increase the \nnumber of Democratic-majority districts at the expense of Detroit-area Black voters.”  But race \ncan predominate “even if the evidence reveals that a legislature elevated race to the predominant \ncriterion in order to advance other goals, including political ones.”  Cooper, 581 U.S. at 291 n.1.  \nPlaintiffs’ admission therefore does not control the outcome here.   \n  The Commission also argues that plaintiffs lack evidence of racial predominance because, \n“when  race  and  political  affiliation  are  highly  correlated”—as  everyone  agrees  they  are  in \nDetroit—courts  “must  exercise  extraordinary  caution”  before  attributing  racial  intent  to  a \nredistricting body.  Easley v. Cromartie, 532 U.S. 234, 242 (2001).  Moreover, the Commission \nsays, its experts opine that considerations of political fairness—not race—best explain the Hickory \nand Linden maps.  Cf. Cooper, 581 U.S. at 320.  According to Trende, however, the new-district \nboundaries cross the Wayne County boundary in ways designed “to take portions of the Black \ncommunity and then stretch the districts out into the suburbs.”  ECF No. 71-1, PID1033.  By way \nof example, Trende says that District 7 “reaches deeply into Detroit, but then carefully avoids high \n[black voting-age population] precincts in Oakland County.”  On this issue as well, therefore, the \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 81,  PageID.2043   Filed 08/29/23   Page 15 of 16\ncompeting expert opinions raise a genuine issue of fact as to the Commission’s motivation.  See \nHunt v. Cromartie, 526 U.S. 541, 529 (1999).   \nb. \n  The Commission also seeks summary judgment as to plaintiffs’ equal-protection claims \nregarding House District 2 and Senate District 11 in particular.  Specifically, the Commission \nargues, the plaintiffs have offered no evidence that the Commission could have drawn those \ndistricts with a higher black voting-age population.  We agree as to House District 2: the current \nblack voting-age population in that district is 11.04%, and plaintiffs’ proposed map would place \nthe same black community in a district with a black voting-age population of 11.63%.  Moreover, \nTrende’s report shows that the black voting-age population was similarly low in the 2011 districts \nin this area.  ECF No. 71-1, PID1004.  Thus, plaintiffs have not offered any evidence that the \nCommission gerrymandered District 2 to reduce its black voting-age population.   \nBut the same is not true as to Senate District 11.  According to Trende, that district “cracks” \nthe black community in Detroit by connecting it to suburban white areas further north.  And \nTrende’s map shows that the black community in District 11 could have been connected with \nneighboring communities to form a majority-minority district.  Unlike District 2, District 11 could \ntherefore have been drawn to have a much higher black voting-age population.  Trende’s opinions \ntherefore create a genuine issue of fact as to District 11.  \nThe Commission finally argues that, even if race had been its predominant motive, it should \nprevail under strict scrutiny as a matter of law.  But that argument is plainly premature here.  By \nway of background, the Supreme Court has assumed, without deciding, that compliance with the \nVRA can be a compelling interest that supports drawing districts along racial lines.  Bethune-Hill, \n580 U.S. at 193.  Whether the Commission could show that compelling interest, if need be, \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 81,  PageID.2044   Filed 08/29/23   Page 16 of 16\ntherefore depends on whether they had good reason to think that the lines drawn in the Linden and \nHickory maps—as opposed to maps that reduced the black-voter percentages to, say, 55% rather \nthan 45%—were necessary to comply with the VRA.  And setting aside the “reason to think” issue, \nthe question whether the Commission went too far in lowering black voter percentages in Detroit-\narea districts is what the trial in this case will be about.   \n* *  *\nPlaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment is denied.  We dismiss, for lack of jurisdiction, \nplaintiffs’ VRA and Equal Protection claims challenging House District 13.  The Commission’s \nmotion for summary judgment is granted, on res judicata grounds, as to plaintiffs’ VRA and Equal \nProtection claims challenging House District 26 and Senate District 5.  The Commission’s motion \nfor summary judgment is also granted as to plaintiffs’ VRA claims challenging House Districts 2, \n8, 11, 13, 26 and Senate Districts 5, 10, and 11, and as to plaintiffs’ Equal Protection claim against \nHouse District 2.  We grant summary judgment to Secretary Benson as to all the claims on which \nwe grant the same to the Commission.  The Commission’s motion is denied as to plaintiffs’ \nremaining claims. \nIT IS SO ORDERED. \nDate:  August 29, 2023  ___/s_/_  _R_a_y_m__o_n_d_ M__. _K_e_t_h_le_d_g_e______ \nRaymond M.

The  Michigan  Independent  Citizens  Redistricting  Commission  (hereafter  the \n“Commission”) is comprised of thirteen citizens of this State who are charged with the exclusive \nauthority to adopt voting district boundaries for the Michigan Senate and Michigan House of \nRepresentatives.   \n2.  On December 28, 2021, the Commission adopted district boundary maps for the \nMichigan Senate and Michigan House of Representatives. \n3.  The Commission drew Michigan Senate Districts 1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 10, and 11 (hereafter \nthe “Senate Districts” and/or the “Linden Plan”) and Michigan House of Representatives Districts \n1, 2, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 26 (hereafter the “House Districts” and/or the “Hickory Plan”) \n(hereafter collectively referred to as the “Districts,” and/or the “District Plans,” and/or some \nsimilar variation thereof) in violation of Section 2 of the federal Voting Rights Act, 52 U.S.C. § \n10301, (hereafter “VRA”) and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the \nUnited States Constitution, U.S. Const. amend. XIV, § 1 (hereafter “Equal Protection Clause”). \n4.  For nearly a half-century, the Senate and House district maps located in southeast \nMichigan were drawn such that the Black voting age populations (hereafter “BVAPs”) were \nsufficiently above 50% in order to comply with the VRA, and specifically to ensure that Black \nvoters would have the opportunity to elect their candidates of choice. \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 8,  PageID.86   Filed 04/13/22   Page 4 of 70\n \n5.  The Commission has deprived Black voters in the surrounding area of Metropolitan \nDetroit (hereafter “Metro Detroit”)1 of this protected opportunity.  \n6.  The Commission reduced the amount of Black voter majority-minority House \nDistricts (i.e., districts with BVAPs over 50%) from ten (10) to six (6). \n7.   The Commission reduced the amount of Black voter majority-minority Senate \nDistricts from two (2) to complete elimination (0). \n8.  The  Commission  created  the  Senate  and  House  Districts  with  race  as  the \npredominant consideration. \n9.  Compliance with the applicable laws and standards was neither impossible nor \nonerous. Plaintiffs will provide an illustrative remedy map in the course of these proceedings that \nwill show the Commission had ample ability to draw the Districts in such a way to comply with \nthe Equal Protection Clause and Section 2 of the VRA. \n10.  Because the Defendants deprived each of them their voting rights secured under \nSection 2 of the VRA and/or the Equal Protection Clause, Plaintiffs bring this Amended Complaint \nfor declaratory relief and request that this Court order the maps be reconfigured to comply with \nthe applicable law. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n11.

Article I, Section 2 of the United States Constitution provides that the State of \nMichigan has the “primary responsibility for apportionment of their federal congressional and state \nlegislative districts.” Growe v. Emison, 507 U.S. 25, 34 (1993) (citing U.S. Const. art. I, § 2).   \n58.  Prior  to  2018,  the  Michigan  Legislature  (hereafter  the  “Legislature”)  was \nresponsible for adopting congressional and state legislature district boundaries. Mich. Const. art. \nIV, § 6(1).  \n59.  The Michigan legislative districts were redrawn following the release of the 2010 \nUnited States Census (hereafter the “2010 Districts”).  \n60.  The 2010 Districts were effective until the Commission adopted the Hickory and \nLinden Plans on December 28, 2021.  \n61.  The 2010 Districts relevant to this action are largely contained within county lines, \nare extremely compact, and result in the creation of multiple Black voter majority-minority \ndistricts.  \n29 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 8,  PageID.112   Filed 04/13/22   Page 30 of 70\n \n62.  The below maps represent the BVAP and white voting age population (hereafter \n“WVAP”) for Detroit voting precincts in the 2020 election.2  \n \nThe Hickory Plan \n63.  Of the eighteen (18) highest BVAP 2010 House Districts in the area surrounding \nMetro Detroit, ten (10) were Black voter majority-minority districts.  \n64.  Black voters in these 2010 House Districts were given an adequate opportunity to \nelect the candidate of their choice. \n65.  The Commission did not think including as many Black voter majority-minority \ndistricts was as important when it adopted the Hickory Plan, reducing this amount to six (6). \n                                                 \n2 These maps cover both the House and Senate Districts. \n30 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 8,  PageID.113   Filed 04/13/22   Page 31 of 70\n \n66.  The Commission significantly lowered the BVAP of the eighteen (18) highest \nBVAPs House Districts near Metro Detroit.  \n67.  In crafting the Hickory Plan, the Commission lowered the BVAP from Districts \nwith an already high BVAP and redistricted Black voters to Districts with far lower BVAPs. \n \n31 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 8,  PageID.114   Filed 04/13/22   Page 32 of 70\n \n \n \n   \n \n32 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 8,  PageID.115   Filed 04/13/22   Page 33 of 70\n \n \n \n \n \n33 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 8,  PageID.116   Filed 04/13/22   Page 34 of 70\n \nThe Linden Plan \n68.  Of the ten (10) highest BVAP 2010 Senate Districts in the area surrounding Metro \nDetroit, two (2) were Black voter majority-minority districts. \n69.  Black voters in these 2010 Senate Districts were given an adequate opportunity to \nelect the candidate of their choice. \n70.  During the span of elections from 2012-2020, each of these two (2) Senate Districts \nsaw the Black voter candidate of choice win the Democratic Party Primary Election in addition to \nthe general election. \n71.  The Commission decided to eliminate all of the Black voter majority-minority \ndistricts when it adopted the Linden Plan. \n72.  As it did with the Hickory Plan, the Commission significantly lowered the BVAP \nof the ten (10) highest BVAPs Senate Districts near Metro Detroit. \n73.  District BVAPs in the Linden Plan are reduced by keeping the same number of \nDistricts with a BVAP of at least 40% while eliminating those above a BVAP over 46%. \n74.  The Commission redistricted Black voters outward from the City of Detroit towards \nand into suburban areas with a traditionally higher WVAP. \n \n \n \n    \n        \n \n \n \n34 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 8,  PageID.117   Filed 04/13/22   Page 35 of 70\n \n \n35 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 8,  PageID.118   Filed 04/13/22   Page 36 of 70\n \n \n \n \n36 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 8,  PageID.119   Filed 04/13/22   Page 37 of 70\n \n75.  The above maps and charts illustrate that the Commission’s intentions in creating \nthe Linden Plan was to replace Black voter majority-minority districts with so-called “influence \ndistricts.” \nThe Commission’s Unlawful Drawing Process   \n76.  Pursuant to the 2018 ballot proposal, the Michigan Constitution was amended to \nestablish the Commission (hereafter the “Amendment”). Mich. Const. art. IV, § 6(1). \n77.  According to the United States Census Bureau, 61.6% of Michigan voters identified \ntheir race as white alone in 2020. Another 12.4% identified their race as Black alone, while 18.7% \nidentified their ethnicity as Hispanic. Asian residents constituted 6% of the population, while \nAmerican Indians constituted 1.1% of the population. Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders were 0.2% \nof  the  population.  8.4%  of  residents  identified  as  “Some  Other  Race,”  while  10.2%  of \nMichiganders responded that they identified with two or more races.3  \n78.  Michigan’s non-white population is heavily concentrated in the Metro Detroit area, \nparticularly in western Detroit, southern Wayne County, and around Pontiac. \n79.  The Commission considered six total proposed Senate District plans prior to \nadopting the Linden Plan.4   \n80.  The Commission considered four total proposed House District plans prior to \nadopting the Hickory Plan.5   \n                                                 \n3 Note that these numbers do not add up to 100, because “Hispanic” is considered a separate, \nnon-racial category.  Thus, a Michigan resident may identify as Hispanic White, non-Hispanic \nWhite, Hispanic Black, non-Hispanic Black, and so forth. \n4 https://www.michigan.gov/micrc/0,10083,7-418-107190_109075---,00.html \n5 https://www.michigan.gov/micrc/0,10083,7-418-107190_109075---,00.html \n \n37 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 8,  PageID.120   Filed 04/13/22   Page 38 of 70\n \n81.  The Commission hired Dr. Lisa Handley, a consultant with the ACE Electoral \nKnowledge Network,6 to determine if the proposed maps would comply with Section 2 of the \nVRA. \n82.  In  her  report  (hereafter  the  “Handley  Report”),  Dr.  Handley  informed  the \nCommission that a district with a 35% - 40% BVAP would allow Black voters in the area \nsurrounding Metro Detroit to elect the candidate of their choice.7 \n83.  Accepting the Handley Report’s threshold for BVAPs, the Commission lowered \nthe amount of Black voter majority-minority House districts from ten (10) to six (6). The Linden \nPlan eliminates all Black voter majority-minority Senate districts.  \n                                                 \n6 https://aceproject.org/electoral-advice/author/handley \n7  Handley, Lisa, Report to the Michigan Independent Citizens Redistricting Commission \n(hereafter “Handley Report”), p. 22. \nhttps://www.michigan.gov/documents/micrc/MICRC_Dr_Handley_Final_Report_744296_7.pdf \n \n38 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 8,  PageID.121   Filed 04/13/22   Page 39 of 70\n \n \n84.  Per the findings from the Handley Report, the Commission replaced the deleted \nBlack voter majority-minority House and Senate Districts with so-called “Minority Opportunity \nDistricts.”8 \n85.  These Districts are also known, per Defendant Benson, as “influence districts.” \n86.  The Commission’s Minority Opportunity Districts intentionally lowered BVAP by \nplacing Black voters in Districts where it is predicted that the District majority will vote for the \nBlack voter candidate of choice. The Handley Report describes this as “white crossover voting.”9   \n87.  White crossover voting is accomplished by “cracking” or “unpacking” Black voters \ninto the desired Districts.

As noted by Defendant Benson, there are “dangers in allowing influence districts \nto replace majority-minority districts[.]”10 Specifically, Defendant Benson has explained that \nwhile some “believe that a decrease in racially polarized voting makes it possible for communities \nof color to elect their candidates of choice by building coalitions with white voters, [Professor \nPamela] Karlan argues it is still nearly impossible for minority candidates to elect the candidate of \ntheir choice outside of districts where more than 50% of the voting age population is a combination \nof minority groups. Karlan’s arguments are supported by current empirical evidence.”11 That’s \nwhy Defendant Benson “proposed a ban on reductions below 55% of covered minority populations \nin any currently majority-minority district, unless the jurisdiction can present convincing evidence \nthat racially polarized voting is nonexistent or that minority voters’ participation rates will remain \nunaffected.”12  \n89.  The  decision  and  support  for  relying  on  white  crossover  voting  is  flawed, \nspeculative, contrary to Sixth Circuit precedent, and will deny Black voters the opportunity to elect \ntheir candidate of their choice.  \n90.  The Commission adopted the approach from the Handley Report despite other \nreadily available data.  \na.  A non-partisan report conducted by the Michigan State University Institute for \nPublic Policy and Social Research (the “MSU Report”) found that most of the \ncomputer-generated models available to the Commission could “feature at least \n                                                 \n10 Turning Lemons into Lemonade: Making Georgia v.

The MSU Report found that most of the computer-generated models available to \nthe Commission could feature “at least two and probably three Michigan Senate” \nmajority-minority districts.14 \n91.  The Handley Report relies on conclusions on general election data where white \ncandidates are assumed to be the Black voter candidate of choice. In theory white voters vote as a \nbloc  to  elect  the  Black  voter  candidate  of  choice,  thus  resulting  in  outcomes  not  racially \npolarized.15  \n92.  These models do not consider elections that feature a Black candidate on the ballot \nrunning against the presumed white voter candidate of choice.  \n93.  The Handley Report fails to consider the possibility of racial polarization resulting \nin white-block voting where the candidate of choice for Black voters is non-white. \n94.  The 2018 Michigan Gubernational Democratic Primary provides an example. \na.  In the Metro Detroit area, Gretchen Whitmer was the candidate of choice among \nwhite voters, winning upwards of 60% of their vote in most of the House \nDistricts.  \nb.  On the other hand, Sri Thanedar, who is non-white, was the Black voter \ncandidate of choice and received little support from white voters in the same \nDistricts. \n                                                 \n13 Michigan Redistricting Map Analysis, Institute for Public Policy and Social Research \n(hereafter the “MSU Report”), at p. 119 https://ippsr.msu.edu/sites/default/files/SOSS/data-\npublications/FINALInterimReportWebUpdated22-compressed.pdf \n14 Id. at p. 109. \n15 Handley Report at pp. 19-21. \n41 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 8,  PageID.124   Filed 04/13/22   Page 42 of 70\n \nc.  Thanedar carried House Districts 4, 5, 7, 8, and 9. When evaluating these results \nunder the Hickory Plan, Thanedar does not prevail in any of these Districts \nbecause the BVAP is too low. \nd.  Thus, adopting the white crossover theory can result in Black voters seeing their \nvote diluted, greatly increasing the probability that they will not have the \nadequate opportunity to elect the candidate of their choice.   \n95.  The Sixth Circuit has already squarely rejected the Commission’s application of the \nusing the white crossover theory to evaluate whether Black voters can elect the candidate of their \nchoice.  \n96.  Data that considers elections featuring Black or non-white candidates provides \nevidence that is most probative. Rural W. Tennessee Afr.-Am. Affs. Council v. Sundquist, 209 F.3d \n835, 837 (6th Cir. 2000).  \na.  In this case, the Sixth Circuit held that the election outcomes of Black candidates \nvs. white candidates offers more probative evidence of vote dilution than the \noutcomes of elections featuring a white candidate vs. other white candidates. Id. \nb.  Stated differently, in determining whether a white voter majority in a district \nvotes sufficiently as a bloc to enable it to usually defeat the Black voter’s \npreferred candidate, it is best to examine how Black candidates fair in elections \nfeaturing white candidates.  \nc.  If the Black candidate prevails more often, there is not likely a white voter voting \nblock preventing Black voters an adequate opportunity to elect the candidate of \nchoice.  \n42 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 8,  PageID.125   Filed 04/13/22   Page 43 of 70\n \nd.  But, as was the case in the Gubernatorial Democratic Primary Election of 2018, \nracially polarized elections resulting in the routine victory of the white voter \ncandidate of choice shows that Black voters cannot elect their candidate of \nchoice.   \n97.  The Handley Report, and therefore the Commission, also erroneously relies on data \nfrom general elections. General election data is irrelevant and unreliable in determining if Black \nvoters have an adequate opportunity to elect their candidate of choice.  \n98.  Each of the Districts with a BVAP of 35% or higher routinely and overwhelmingly \nelects the Democratic candidate in the general election.  \n99.  Because  Black  voters  have  historically  and  consistently  voted  cohesively  for \nDemocratic candidates, the Black candidate of choice will almost certainly win the general \nelection. \n100.  Thus, the proper analysis is whether the Black voter candidate of choice can prevail \nin a Democratic Primary Election.  \n101.  In the course of these proceedings, Plaintiffs will submit an expert report by Sean \nP. Trende (hereafter “Expert Report), which uses a statistical technique known as ecological \nregression to examine how varying levels of BVAP may predict the success rate of the Black voter \ncandidate of choice in a Democratic Primary Election.  \n102.  While the Handley Report engages in similar analysis to estimate group voting \nbehavior from aggregate data, it fails to consider, let alone justify the BVAPs levels in the Hickory \nand Linden Plans. \n103.  This  is  especially  troublesome  given  the  increased  difficulty  facing  Black \ncandidates in Democratic Primary Elections in these Districts. \n43 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 8,  PageID.126   Filed 04/13/22   Page 44 of 70\n \n104.  Yet the Commission relies on BVAP levels with no proven record of success in \nelecting Black candidates of choice.  \na.  The 2010 House District Maps contain one (1) District with a BVAP between 36% \nand 53%. Ten (10) of the 2010 House Districts contain a BVAP over 53%, with the \nhighest being 94.3% \ni.  The Hickory Plan features ten (10) Districts with a BVAP between \n36% and 53%, with only six (6) Districts exceeding 53%, and the \nhighest being 56.8%. \nb.  The 2010 Senate District Maps contain only one (1) District with a BVAP between \n35.5% and 47%. \ni.  The Linden Plan features six (6) Districts with BVAP level between \n35.5% and 47% (and no districts with a BVAP in excess of 47%). \n105.  The Commission’s decision to lower the BVAP from the 2010 District Maps across \nthe board in the Hickory and Linden Plans will result in Black candidates struggling to find success \nin future elections. \n106.   As a result, Black voters will not have an adequate opportunity to elect the \ncandidate of their choice. \n107.  Examining past Democratic Primary Elections illustrates this. \nSenate Primary Elections \n108.  A Black voter candidate of choice (Vincent Gregory) prevailed in District 11 \n(35.5% BVAP) during the 2014 Democratic Senate Primary Election by 0.4% over the white \ncandidates. \n44 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 8,  PageID.127   Filed 04/13/22   Page 45 of 70\n \n109.  However, Senator Gregory’s vote share mirrored the Black voter share of the \nelectorate. In keeping with Sixth Circuit precedent and assigning probative value to candidate race, \nit is likely that had the BVAP been lower, or had the white voter vote been less divided between \nthe two white candidates, Senator Gregory would not have prevailed. \n110.  In District 4 (47% BVAP), the Black candidate (Virgil Smith) prevailed narrowly \nover a Middle Eastern candidate and a white candidate in the 2014 Democratic Senate Primary \nElection. But again, his vote share followed the BVAP closely. If the BVAP were lower than 47%, \na Black candidate may have lost against unified opposition. \n111.  District 5 contained the highest BVAP (54.3%) and featured three (3) Black \ncandidates. Yet the Black voter candidate of choice did not prevail in 2014 Democratic Primary \nElection. The total vote share for the Black candidates was 61%, about seven (7) points higher \nthan the BVAP, suggesting that a BVAP of less than 43% would make it difficult for Black \ncandidates to prevail. \n112.  The 2018 Democratic Senate Primary Election for District 1 (44.7% BVAP) saw \nthe white voter candidate of choice (who the Handley Report estimates won 77% of the white vote \nbut just 23% of the Black vote) won a near-majority of the vote. Note that this District has a higher \nBVAP than all but one of the newly drawn Senate Districts. \n45 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 8,  PageID.128   Filed 04/13/22   Page 46 of 70\n \n \n \n \n \n46 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 8,  PageID.129   Filed 04/13/22   Page 47 of 70\n \n113.  The following table summarizes Democratic Senate Primary Elections in the Metro \nDetroit area that features a competitive race and racial polarization amongst the electorate: \n \n114.  This table shows three (3) occasions where the Black voter candidate of choice \nprevailed. These victories were not by large margins. The vote share for the Black voter candidate \nof choice closely mirrored the respective BVAPs. \n115.  The totality of this evidence illustrates that the Black voter candidate of choice has \nnot been successful in any racially polarized election in the greater Metro Detroit area where the \nBVAP is below 47% and have even lost where the BVAP exceeds this percentage. \n116.  Because the Linden Plan creates only two (2) districts with BVAP over 42% and \ndoes not create any district with a BVAP that has historically allowed Black candidates to succeed \nin Democratic Senate Primary Elections, it will deprive Black voters an adequate opportunity to \nelect their candidate of choice. \nHouse Primary Elections \n117.  There is no evidence to conclude that the Black voter candidate of choice can \nroutinely prevail in a racially polarized Democratic House Primary Election in a district with a \n47 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 8,  PageID.130   Filed 04/13/22   Page 48 of 70\n \nBVAP below 47%. Yet the Hickory Plan creates twelve (12) Districts with a BVAP range from \n36% to 47%. \n118.  To help justify the BVAP of these districts the Commission relied on a single \nexample from the Handley Report, the 2018 District 11 Democratic House Primary Election. The \nBlack voter candidate of choice was an incumbent, who was initially selected by district delegates \nvia special election. \n119.  While historical examples from Democratic House Primary Elections are not as \nconclusive because they often feature multiple candidates, Black voters already face difficulty in \nelecting the candidate of their choice.  \n120.   For example, the 2018 Democratic House Primary Election for District 2 (60.3% \nBVAP) featured a crowded field of candidates. The winner prevailed with nearly 67% white voter \nsupport and roughly 10% of support from Black voters. Here, white voters coalesced behind a \ncandidate while Black voters spread their support among multiple candidates. \n121.  Yet, the Commission lowered the BVAP across the board despite the data from \nprevious elections showing that Black voters cannot routinely elect their candidate of choice in \nDistricts with BVAPs from 30% to roughly 45%, and still may struggle in Districts in the 50% \nrange. \nThe Commission’s Predominant Consideration of Race \n122.  The Amendment created rules of which the Commission must adhere to when \ncreating each district. Article IV, Section 6(13) of the Michigan Constitution provides that the \ncommissioners must abide “by the following criteria in proposing and adopting each plan, in order \nof priority”:  \nA.  Districts shall be of equal population as mandated by the United \nStates  Constitution,  and  shall  be  geographically  contiguous. \n48 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 8,  PageID.131   Filed 04/13/22   Page 49 of 70\n \nIsland areas are considered to be contiguous by land to the \ncounty of which they are a part. \nB.  Districts  shall  reflect  the  state’s  diverse  population  and \ncommunities of interest. Communities of interest may include, \nbut shall not be limited to, populations that share cultural or \nhistorical characteristics or economic interests. Communities of \ninterest  do  not  include  relationships  with  political  parties, \nincumbents, or political candidates. \nC.  Districts shall not provide a disproportionate advantage to any \npolitical party. A disproportionate advantage to a political party \nshall  be  determined  using  accepted  measures  of  partisan \nfairness. \nD.  Districts shall not favor or disfavor an incumbent elected official \nor a candidate. \nE.  Districts shall reflect consideration of county, city, and township \nboundaries. \nF.  Districts shall be reasonably compact. \n123.  As will be shown by the simulation analysis described in Plaintiffs’ forthcoming \nExpert Report, the Commission clearly drew the House and Senate District maps with race as the \npredominant consideration over others. \n124.  This analysis involves generating numerous models (an “ensemble”) of voting \ndistrict maps. The ensemble is created without reference to a particular fixed factor, also known \nas a constraint of interest. In other words, it also allows the user to specify constraints under which \ndistrict lines are drawn, such as compactness, population equality, and respect for municipal lines. \nThe ensemble is then compared to the reference maps to determine if the constraint of interest was \nconsidered when created. \n125.  For example, if a district map resembles the ensemble maps without reference to a \nspecific constraint of interest factor, it is a reasonable conclusion that it was not a dominant \nconsideration by the Commission.  If, however, the ensemble is an outlier when compared to the \n49 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 8,  PageID.132   Filed 04/13/22   Page 50 of 70\n \nCommission’s drawing, the logical conclusion is that the Commission’s maps were likely drawn \nwith respect to that factor. \n126.  Plaintiffs’ analysis generated models as “race blind.” In other words, racial data \nwas tracked but was not used as a constraint. The results show that the Hickory and Linden Plans \nwere drawn with race as the predominant consideration over the criteria in Section 6(13) and other \ntraditional, race-neutral considerations.  \nRacial Predominance in the Hickory Plan \n127.  To ensure that the ensemble generated the same number of districts as the Hickory \nPlan and to reflect the basic locations of potential race-based districting, Plaintiffs’ analysis \nseparates all Michigan House Districts into three divisions. The first division includes all precincts \nlocated within districts that were contained, in whole or in part, in Wayne, Macomb, Oakland, \nMonroe or Washtenaw counties. House Districts 1-33, 46-49, 51-63, 65, and 66 were included in \nthis division. Two House Districts located in the northwest portion of Oakland were excluded as \ncore districts for the second division. \n128.  The results reveal that House Districts 1, 2, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 26 were \ndrawn with race as the predominate factor.  \n129.  A district drawn without consideration of race would ordinarily yield a BVAP \nbetween 93% and 94.5%. The lowest BVAP in a racially neutrally drawn district would yield a \nBVAP of 77.5%, this representing the outlier. \n130.  The Hickory Plan’s highest district BVAP generated to 56.8%, roughly fourteen \n(14) standard deviations away from the average BVAP of the highest BVAP map produced in the \nensemble. \n50 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 8,  PageID.133   Filed 04/13/22   Page 51 of 70\n \n131.  Without question, the Hickory Plan should have included a seventh Black voter \nmajority-minority District. It would be reasonable to draw an eighth or a ninth. Instead, the Hickory \nDistricts with the seventh, eighth, and ninth highest BVAPs are 47%, 44%, and 44%, respectively. \n132.  A tenth Black voter majority-minority could also be drawn, though it would \nrepresent an outlier. \n133.  Districts 10-21 include a much higher WVAP than would be expected if drawn with \nracially neutral considerations. \n134.  Thus, the Hickory Plan Districts with higher BVAPs were constructed with racial \nconsiderations as the predominant factor. However, the Hickory Districts with a higher WVAP \nwere drawn with racially neutral considerations. \n135.  The Commission moved white voters from Districts with a moderate BVAP to \nDistricts with a high BVAP to dilute Black voter voting strength. \nRacial Predominance in the Linden Plan \n136.  Analysis of the Linden Plan reveals the same conclusion. Had race not been a \npredominant consideration, the Linden Plan would have produced at least three Black voter \nmajority-minority districts from Wayne and the adjoining counties. Instead, it produced zero. \n137.  Districts in the Linden Plan with the four highest BVAPs significantly decreased, \nwhile the next five districts saw an increase in WVAP.  \n138.  When  ensembles  were  adjusted  to  consider  other  race-neutral  factors,  racial \nconsiderations were still apparent in the Linden Plan. \n \n \n \n51 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 8,  PageID.134   Filed 04/13/22   Page 52 of 70\n \nPublic Comments from Commissioners \n139.  Comments from several commissioners during the meeting to adopt to Hickory and \nLinden Plans likewise reveal that the Districts were drawn with race as the predominant factor. \n140.  Defendant Lange expressed that more consideration was given to “certain groups” \nsuch that the Districts may have issues with VRA compliance.16  \n141.  Agreeing  with  Defendant  Lange's  comment,  Defendant  Wagner  proposed  the \nCommission spend more time on developing the Hickory Plan.17 \n142.  In Defendant Kellom’s view, “I also happen to think we could do better for the City \nof Detroit and for people of color all over the State of Michigan in terms of representation to have \na more equitable map.”18  \n143.  Defendant Szetela remarked that the Commission “received very vigorous public \ncomment particularly around VRA issues and particularly with primaries and democratic primaries \nand are these maps representative and do they actually provide the Black community in Detroit \nwith the ability to elect.”19 \n144.  Following public comment, Defendant Lange summarized by saying “I think the \nconsensus with the public comment is everybody wants the maps to be fair. They want more \nconsideration given to communities of interest. More consideration given to VRA.”20 \n \n                                                 \n16 Michigan Independent Citizens Redistricting Committee Dec 28. 2021 Meeting Transcript, \nhttps://www.michigan.gov/documents/micrc/MICRC_Mtg_Transcript_12_28_21_745567_7.pdf  \np. 30. \n17 Id. \n18 Id. at p. 33. \n19 Id. \n20 Id. at p. 30. \n \n52 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 8,  PageID.135   Filed 04/13/22   Page 53 of 70\n \n \nBlack Voters Disapprove \n145.  There  is  clearly  a  lack  of  trust  among  Black  voters.   In  February  2022,  the \nGlengariff Group conducted a survey of 600 Michigan voters and identified a racial divide between \nhow white voters and Black voters view the Hickory and Linden Plans.21  \n146.  53%  of  white  voters  approved  of  the  Commission’s  attempts  to  consider \ncommunities of interest, while 54% of Black voters disapproved.22 Richard Czuba, president of \nthe Glengariff Group, referred to this racial discrepancy as “a very sharp statistical difference.”23 \nCOUNT I  \nViolation of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act  \nHouse VRA Plaintiffs  \n(House Districts 1, 2, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 26) \n \n147.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference all preceding allegations as if fully restated \nherein.  \n148.  The VRA prohibits any “State or political subdivision” to impose, or cause to be \napplied, any voting “standard, practice, or procedure” which “results in a denial or abridgment of \nany right of any citizen of the United States to vote on account of race or color.” 52 U.S.C § 10301. \n149.  To prevail on a claim under Section 2 of the VRA, House VRA Plaintiffs have the \nburden to prove the following three preconditions, as articulated by the United States Supreme \nCourt  in  Thornburg  v.  Gingles,  478  U.S.  30,  50-51  (1986):  1)  that  the  minority  group  is \n“sufficiently large and  geographically  compact to  constitute a majority  in  a single-member \n                                                 \n21 Hendrickson, Clara, Voters generally satisfied with change to redistricting process, poll shows, \nDetroit Free Press, (Feb. 24, 2022, 4:42 PM), \nhttps://www.freep.com/story/news/politics/2022/02/24/michigan-redistricting-poll/6925021001/ \n22 Id. \n23 Id. \n53 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 8,  PageID.136   Filed 04/13/22   Page 54 of 70\n \ndistrict,” 2) that the minority group is “politically cohesive,” and 3) that the rest of the electorate, \nor the white majority, votes sufficiently cohesively as a bloc to defeat the candidate preferred by \nthe minority.  \n150.  Once  these  preconditions  are  established,  courts  examine  the  totality  of \ncircumstances. Id.  \n151.  Factors encompassing the totality of the circumstances include, but are not limited \nto, the extent to which the minority group members are affected by discrimination in education, \nemployment and health, and the extent to which discrimination hinders effective participation in \nelections. Id. at 36-37. \n152.  House VRA Plaintiffs have satisfied the first precondition.  \n153.  Prior to the Hickory Plan, there were ten (10) Black voter majority-minority House \nDistricts in the Metro Detroit area, providing Black voters the opportunity to elect candidates of \ntheir choice and facilitating the House’s membership interests in the Michigan Legislative Black \nCaucus.  \n154.  The Commission lowered this amount to six (6) Districts even though they could \nhave feasibly drafted ten (10). \n155.  House VRA Plaintiffs have also established the second precondition. Historically, \nMichigan Black voters have voted cohesively, first in favor of the pro-abolitionist Republican \nParty following the Civil War, and then transitioning to the Democrat Party following the New \nDeal in the 1930s and increasing with the civil rights legislation signed into law by United States \nPresidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Jonson, to the point that by 2016, only 8% of Black \n54 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 8,  PageID.137   Filed 04/13/22   Page 55 of 70\n \nvoters identified as Republicans, and 70% as Democrats. In the 2016 Presidential Election, 88% \nof Black voters voted for the Democratic nominee.24 \n156.  Black voters in the Metro Detroit area vote “politically cohesively,” as exhibited \nby  the  fact  that  94%  of  Detroit  electorate  voted  for  the  Democratic  nominee  in  the  2020 \nPresidential Election. Black voters encompass 71% of Detroit’s population. The Democratic \nnominee received 50.6% of the statewide vote.25  \n157.  The political cohesiveness is further exemplified by the fact that Black voters \naccount for 14% of Michigan’s statewide population, but account for 20% of the Democratic \nvote.26  \n158.  The Commission has even confirmed the political cohesiveness of Michigan Black \nvoters, stating in a memorandum prepared by its attorney, that “[p]ursuant to the VRA and Gingles, \nDr. Lisa Handley conducted a racially polarized voting analysis for the Michigan Independent \nCitizens Redistricting Commission in which she concluded that racial bloc voting exists in \nMichigan.”27   \n                                                 \n24 See Black Party Affiliation, BLACK DEMOGRAPHICS: THE AFRICAN AMERICAN POPULATION, \n(last accessed Feb. 1, 2022), https://blackdemographics.com/culture/black-politics/. \n25 Warikoo, Niraj, Black Voters in Detroit key for Joe Biden and Gary Peters’ Victories, \nAdvocates Say, DETROIT FREE PRESS, (Pub.

Most importantly, there is cohesive voting among Black voters in favor the Black \nor non-white candidate in the Democratic Primary Elections for House Districts 1, 2, 7, 8, 10, 11, \n12, 13, 14, and 26. \n160.  The  third  precondition  is  also  met.  As  discussed  herein  and  detailed  in  the \nforthcoming Expert Report, white voters generally vote as a bloc to defeat Black voters’ candidate \nof choice, here being the Black candidate in House Democratic Primary Elections.   \n161.  Because each of the Districts with a BVAP of at least 35% historically elects \nDemocratic candidates at an overwhelming rate, the proper analysis is whether the Black voter \ncandidate of choice can prevail in a House Democratic Primary Election. \n162.  The Commission’s actions in lowering the BVAP in each of these Districts dilutes \nthe ability of the House VRA Plaintiffs’ ability to elect candidates of their choice in future House \nDemocratic Primary Elections. \n163.  The totality of the circumstances likewise establishes that the House Districts \nviolate Section 2 of the VRA. Black voters have historically borne the effects of discrimination in \neducation, health, education, and employment opportunities, and continue to bear the effect of this \ndiscrimination, hindering their  ability to effectively participate in the political process.  The \nfollowing demonstrate the historical and continuation of racial discrimination and inequality in \nMichigan: \nA.  Black persons were enslaved in Detroit until 1815.28 \nB.  The initial Michigan Constitution prohibited African-Americans from voting. 29 \n                                                 \n28 Banerjee, Mandira, Detroit’s Dark Secret: Slavery, Michigan Today, (Feb. 19, 2018), \nhttps://michigantoday.umich.edu/2018/02/19/detroits-dark-secret-slavery/. \n29 Jaehnig, Chris, African American Michigan: The Reconstruction Era, The Daily Mining \nGazette, (May 9, 2020), \n \n56 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 8,  PageID.139   Filed 04/13/22   Page 57 of 70\n \nC.  Detroit was a stronghold for the Ku Klux Klan in the early 20th century, and a \nsplinter group called the Black Legion continued to operate in Detroit until the \n1930s.30 \nD.  It was not until 1885 that Michigan enacted a statute to make “discrimination in \npublic places illegal,” and not until 1925 that the statute was enforced.31 \nE.  Today, racially restrictive covenants and redlining practices denying low interest \nmortgages to Black persons are illegal, but have continued segregating effects, \nas they are still dissuaded from buying properties with old restrictive covenants \nand are still denied mortgages that are routinely given to white persons with \nsimilar credentials and circumstances.32 \nF.  As a result, Detroit is the most segregated city in the United States, and the \nGreater Detroit Area is the fourth most segregated metropolitan area in the \ncountry. 33 \n                                                 \nhttps://www.mininggazette.com/news/features/2020/05/african-american-michigan-the-\nreconstruction-era/. \n30 Bak, Richard, The Dark Days of the Black Legion, HOUR DETROIT, (February 23, 2009), \nhttps://www.hourdetroit.com/community/the-dark-days-of-the-black-legion/. \n31 Michigan Legal Milestones 22.

Additionally, because property ownership is a primary method of accumulating \nwealth,  denying  ownership  to  Black  persons  can  lead  to  increased  wealth \ndisparity between Black and white persons.34 This in turn affects voting, as \npersons with lower socioeconomic status are less likely to vote. \nH.  Black persons, Indigenous Persons, and Hispanic persons also suffer disparities \nand unequal treatment in education.  These groups are between 13% and 11% \nless likely to obtain a bachelor’s degree than their white counterparts.35 \nI.  At  the  grade  school  lever,  low  income,  urban  public  schools,  which  are \npredominantly Black, suffer from resource disparities.  \n164.

The  totality  of  circumstances  coupled  with  the  establishment  of  the  three \npreconditions prove House Districts 1, 2, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 26 violate Section 2 of the \nVRA. \nCOUNT II \nViolation of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act \nSenate VRA Plaintiffs \n(Senate Districts 1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 10, and 11) \n \n166.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference all preceding allegations as if fully restated \nherein.  \n167.  To prevail on a claim under Section 2 of the VRA, Senate VRA Plaintiffs have the \nburden to prove the following three preconditions, as articulated by the United States Supreme \nCourt  in  Thornburg  v.  Gingles,  478  U.S.  30,  50-51  (1986):  1)  that  the  minority  group  is \n“sufficiently large and  geographically  compact to  constitute a majority  in  a single-member \ndistrict,” 2) that the minority group is “politically cohesive,” and 3) that the rest of the electorate, \nor the white majority, votes sufficiently cohesively as a bloc to defeat the candidate preferred by \nthe minority.  \n168.  Once  these  preconditions  are  established,  courts  examine  the  totality  of \ncircumstances to determine if a proposed redistricting map violates Section 2 of the VRA. Id.  \n169.  Factors encompassing the totality of the circumstances include, but are not limited \nto, the extent to which the minority group members are affected by discrimination in education, \nemployment and health, and the extent to which discrimination hinders effective participation in \nelections. Id. at 36-37. \n170.  Senate VRA Plaintiffs have satisfied the first precondition.  \n171.  Prior to the Commission’s redistricting, there were two (2) Black voter majority-\nminority Senate Districts in the Metro Detroit area. \n59 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 8,  PageID.142   Filed 04/13/22   Page 60 of 70\n \n172.  The Linden Plan eliminates all Black voter majority-minority Senate Districts in \nthis area.  \n173.  The Linden Plan could have included at least three minority-majority districts. \n174.  Thus,  Black  voters  in  these  Senate  Districts  are  sufficiently  large  and \ngeographically compact to produce a majority. \n175.  Senate  VRA  Plaintiffs  have  also  met  the  burden  of  establishing  the  second \nprecondition.  \n176.  In addition to voting in a politically cohesive matter for Democratic candidates \nnationally, as a state, and in the challenged Senate Districts surrounding Metro Detroit, the data \ndiscussed herein shows Black voters vote in a politically-cohesive manner for Black candidates in \nDemocratic Primary Elections. The Commission disregarded this.  \n177.  The  third  precondition  is  also  met.  As  discussed  herein  and  detailed  in  the \nforthcoming Expert Report, white voters generally vote as a bloc to defeat Black voters’ candidate \nof choice.   \n178.  Because each of the Districts with a BVAP of at least 35% historically elects \nDemocratic candidates at an overwhelming rate, the proper analysis is whether the Black voter \ncandidate of choice can prevail in a Senate Democratic Primary Election.  \n179.  The Commission’s actions in eliminating Black voter majority-minority Districts \ndilutes the ability of Black voters’ ability to elect candidates of their choice, specifically in future \nSenate Democratic Primary Elections. \n180.  The  totality  of  circumstances  coupled  with  the  establishment  of  the  three \npreconditions prove Senate Districts 1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 10, and 11 violate Section 2 of the VRA. \n60 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 8,  PageID.143   Filed 04/13/22   Page 61 of 70\n \nCOUNT III \nViolation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United \nStates Constitution – Racial Gerrymandering \nHouse Equal Protection Plaintiffs \n(House Districts 1, 2, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 26) \n \n181.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference all preceding allegations as if fully restated \nherein. \n182.  House Equal Protection Plaintiffs are entitled to the equal protection of law under \nthe Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution, which provides that no state shall \n“deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.”  \n183.  An Equal Protection violation arises when persons are treated disparately or in an \narbitrary fashion under the law.   \n184.  The Equal Protection Clause prohibits government from treating citizens along \nracial lines, including when it comes creating voting districts. Miller v. Johnson, 515 U.S. 900, \n911, 115 S. Ct. 2475, 2485, 132 L. Ed. 2d 762 (1995). \n185.  Under  the  Equal  Protection  Clause,  district  maps  that  have  been  racially \ngerrymandered  are  “constitutionally  suspect  .  .  .  whether  or  not  the  reason  for  the  racial \nclassification is benign or the purpose remedial.”  Shaw v. Hunt, 517 U.S. 899, 905 (1996).   \n186.  In drafting the House Districts, the Commission subordinated traditional, race-\nneutral  principles, such as compactness,  contiguity, and respect  for political  subdivision  or \ncommunities to race as the predominant consideration for drawing district lines. See Miller v. \nJohnson, 515 U.S. 900, 915, 115 S.Ct. 2475 (1995); see also Easley v. Cromartie, 532 U.S. 234, \n241, 121 S.Ct. 1452 (2001). \n187.  The  Commission  stacked  Black  voters  into  districts  that  traditionally  have  a \nmajority white VAP with the intent to have the lowest BVAP as could be rationalized. \n61 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 8,  PageID.144   Filed 04/13/22   Page 62 of 70\n \n188.  The Commission’s actions discriminate against House Equal Protection Plaintiffs \non the basis of race in one or more of the ways set forth below, each sufficient to demonstrate race-\nbased discrimination used to include or exclude House Equal Protection Plaintiffs in these House \nDistricts with race being the predominant consideration: \n(a) As evidenced by the demographics of the plan as a whole, the Commission drafted the \nHouse Districts with a racially discriminatory purpose; \n(b) The House Districts were drafted with a discriminatory purpose evidenced by the fact \nthat traditional redistricting principles and natural population shifts were ignored in favor \nof a racial classification used to artificially manipulate the BVAP of each district. \ni.  In its analysis of the proposed House Districts, the MSU Report acknowledges \nthat the Commission ignored traditional redistricting principles in forming \noddly shaped, non-compact maps: “Viewers can confirm, by visual inspection, \nthat compactness was not a guiding factor in the design of these maps.”37  \nii.  The MSU report further concludes that the “cross-city, cross-county districts,” \nwith “elongated, serrated, tool-like or key-like shapes” and “intertwining” arms \nwere  “racially motivated” to  split  the BVAP that  had existed in  the two \nmajority-Black districts.38   \niii. The “non-compact, earmuff-shaped districts” do not reflect Communities of \nInterest within the state.39  \n                                                 \n37 MSU Report at p. 129. \n38 Id. \n39 Id. at p. 130. \n \n62 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 8,  PageID.145   Filed 04/13/22   Page 63 of 70\n \niv. Furthermore, the House Districts create a large number of districts with large \npopulations of Black voters that nevertheless fall short of creating majority \ndistricts by arranging the districts so that Black voters were divided into the \nneighboring suburban areas, thus diluting their voting strength.40 \n(c) The Commission’s purpose in enacting the House Districts, either in whole or in part, \nwas motivated by race and/or the goal of drawing the House Districts with a specific racial \ncomposition in each district; \ni.  According  to  the  MSU  Report,  the  Hickory  Plan  arranges  the  House \nDistricts with a high BVAP in such a way that “urban Black majorities get \npartially  diluted  to  smaller  majorities  in  these  hybrid  urban-suburban \ndistricts.”41 \n(d) The shape of the House Districts disregards existing county lines and are drawn so \nirrational that they can only be explained as a race-based gerrymander. \n189.  Because House Equal Protection Plaintiffs have established that the Commission \nused race as the predominant factor in creating the House Districts, the redistricting scheme is \nsubject to strict scrutiny. Miller, 515 U.S. at 916, 115 S.Ct. 2475.  \n190.  The use of race in creating the House Districts is not narrowly tailored to achieve a \ncompelling governmental interest.  \n191.  The Commission cannot provide adequate justification for its racial discrimination \nagainst House Equal Protection Plaintiffs.  \n                                                 \n40 Id. at p. 137. \n41 Id. \n63 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 8,  PageID.146   Filed 04/13/22   Page 64 of 70\n \n192.  While remedying past discrimination may serve as a compelling state interest, the \nCommission has not, and cannot, provide strong evidence of such a remedy. See Id. at 922, 115 \nS.Ct. 2475. Mere compliance with federal antidiscrimination laws alone will not always serve as \na compelling governmental interest. Id. at 921, 115 S.Ct. 2475.  \n193.  The Commission cannot argue that Section 2 VRA compliance satisfies strict \nscrutiny because the House Districts are not in compliance.  \n194.  The Commission’s use of race in drawing the House Districts is not the least \nrestrictive means available to give House Equal Protection Plaintiffs an opportunity to participate \nequally in the political process. \n195.  House Equal Protection Plaintiffs will provide an illustrative remedy map in the \ncourse of these proceedings that will show the Commission had ample ability to draw the Districts \nwith less restrictive means that provide House Equal Protection Plaintiffs with an opportunity to \nparticipate equally in the political process.  \n196.  House Equal Protection Plaintiffs have been, and continue to be, denied equal \nprotection under the law and injured by the Commission’s race-based discrimination. \n197.  House Equal Protection Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law other than the \njudicial relief sought here. Implementation of these House Districts will irreparably harm House \nEqual Protection Plaintiffs by violating their constitutional and statutory rights. \nCOUNT IV \nViolation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the \nUnited States Constitution – Racial Gerrymandering  \nSenate Equal Protection Plaintiffs \n(Senate Districts 1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 10, and 11) \n \n198.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference all preceding allegations as if fully restated \nherein.  \n64 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 8,  PageID.147   Filed 04/13/22   Page 65 of 70\n \n199.  Senate Equal Protection Plaintiffs are entitled to the equal protection of law under \nthe Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution, which provides that no state shall \n“deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.”  \n200.  An Equal Protection violation arises when persons are treated disparately or in an \narbitrary fashion under the law.   \n201.  The Equal Protection Clause prohibits government from treating citizens along \nracial lines, including when it comes creating voting districts. Miller v. Johnson, 515 U.S. 900, \n911, 115 S. Ct. 2475, 2485, 132 L. Ed. 2d 762 (1995). \n202.  Under  the  Equal  Protection  Clause,  district  maps  that  have  been  racially \ngerrymandered  are  “constitutionally  suspect  .  .  .  whether  or  not  the  reason  for  the  racial \nclassification is benign or the purpose remedial.”  Shaw v. Hunt, 517 U.S. 899, 905 (1996).   \n203.  The Commission’s redistricting of the Senate Districts discriminates against Senate \nEqual Protection Plaintiffs on the basis of race in one or more of the ways set forth below, each \nsufficient to demonstrate race-based discrimination used to include or exclude Senate Equal \nProtection Plaintiffs from these Senate Districts with race being the predominant consideration: \n(a) The Senate Districts have a discriminatory purpose evidenced by the demographics of \nthe plan as a whole; \n(b) The Senate Districts were drafted with a discriminatory purpose evidenced by the fact \nthat traditional redistricting principles and natural population shifts were ignored in favor \nof a racial classification used to artificially manipulate the BVAP of each district; \ni.  The MSU Report concludes that at least three majority-minority \ndistricts could have been included, yet the Commission included \n65 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 8,  PageID.148   Filed 04/13/22   Page 66 of 70\n \nnone. Plaintiffs’ forthcoming Expert Report will provide the same \nconclusion.   \nii.  The Commission divides Black voters in a way that creates urban-\nsuburban cross-county districts, thus diluting their vote.   \niii.  According to the MSU Report, the “intent appears to be to create \nmore total  districts” with Black voters, in  an “unconventional” \nway42 to comply with Section 2 of the VRA. \niv.  The MSU Report further expresses that there is insufficient data to \nknow if districts with Black VAP under 45% will allow Black voters \nan opportunity to elect candidates of their choice, amounting to a \nSection 2 VRA violation,43 suggesting that “the MICRC reevaluate \nits approach towards compliance with the Voting Rights Act.”44  \n(c) The Senate Districts have a discriminatory purpose evidenced by their irregular shape \nand ignore traditional redistricting principles and natural population shifts in favor of a \nracial classification used to artificially manipulate the BVAP of each district:  \ni.  The Senate Districts feature elongated districts and are less compact \nthan districts in the rest of the State and the two previous Senate \nDistrict Maps. \nii.  District 1 is elongated and oddly shaped, wrapping around the \nSouthern and Eastern sides of District 2, with curved projections \nextending from the main body of the district. \n                                                 \n42 MSU Report at p. 109. \n43 Id. \n44 Id. \n66 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 8,  PageID.149   Filed 04/13/22   Page 67 of 70\n \niii.  District 2 is oddly shaped, with a myriad of arms or tentacle-like \nprojections extending into the surrounding districts.  \niv.  District  3  is  elongated  and  oddly  shaped,  with  tentacle-like \nprojections extending into the surrounding districts. \nv.  District 4 is elongated and oddly shaped, with a pronounced indent \nto accommodate oddly shaped District 1.  \nvi.  District 5 is oddly shaped with a jigsaw-like boarder with District 6.  \nvii.  District  9 is  oddly shaped  with  a boot-like shape and  a broad \nprojection on its eastern side. \nviii.  District 11 is oddly shaped and diagonally splits Macomb County \nwith jigsaw-like projections.  \nix.  The Senate Districts move large concentrations of Black voters to \ndistricts with a significant higher WVAP, thus diluting their vote.  \nx.  The Senate Districts are so oddly shaped that the Commission could \nnot have drawn them to protect communities of interest.45  \n(d) The Commission’s purpose in enacting the Senate Districts, either in whole or in part, \nwas motivated by race and/or the goal of drawing the Senate Districts with specific racial \ncomposition in each district; \ni.  There is not a single BVAP majority-minority Senate District, even \nthough there could have been at least three (3). Instead, Senate Equal \nProtection Plaintiffs were moved to Senate Districts with lower \nBVAPs. \n                                                 \n45 MSU Report at p. 108. \n67 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 8,  PageID.150   Filed 04/13/22   Page 68 of 70\n \nii.  The MSU Report states that the Senate Districts were drawn with \nrace  as  the  primary  motivating  factor.46  Plaintiffs’  forthcoming \nExpert Report will likewise establish that race was the primary \nmotivating factor.  \niii.  The  MSU  Report  found  it  “striking”  and  “unusual”  that  “no \nmajority-minority district survive[d].”47 \n(e) The shape of the Senate Districts is so irrational that they can only be explained as a \nrace-based gerrymander. \n204.  Because Senate Equal Protection Plaintiffs have established that the Commission \nused race as the predominant factor in creating the Senate Districts, it is subject to strict scrutiny. \nMiller, 515 U.S. at 916, 115 S.Ct. 2475.  \n205.  The Commission’s use of race in drawing the Senate Districts is not narrowly \ntailored to achieve a compelling governmental interest.  \n206.  The Commission cannot provide adequate justification for its racial discrimination \nagainst Senate Equal Protection Plaintiffs.  \n207.  While remedying past discrimination may serve as a compelling state interest, the \nCommission has not, and cannot, provide strong evidence of such a remedy. See Id. at 922, 115 \nS.Ct. 2475. Mere compliance with federal antidiscrimination laws alone will not always serve as \na compelling governmental interest. Id. at 921, 115 S.Ct. 2475. \n208.  The Commission cannot argue that Section 2 VRA compliance satisfies strict \nscrutiny because the Senate Districts are not in compliance. \n                                                 \n46 MSU Report at 108. \n47 MSU Report at pp. 95-96. \n68 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 8,  PageID.151   Filed 04/13/22   Page 69 of 70\n \n209.  The Commission’s use of race in drawing the Senate Districts is not the least \nrestrictive means available to give Senate Equal Protection Plaintiffs an opportunity to participate \nequally in the political process. \n210.  Senate Equal Protection Plaintiffs will provide an illustrative remedy map in the \ncourse of these proceedings that will show the Commission had ample ability to draw the Districts \nwith less restrictive means that provide Senate Equal Protection Plaintiffs with an opportunity to \nparticipate equally in the political process. \n211.  Senate Equal Protection Plaintiffs have been, and continue to be, denied equal \nprotection under the law and injured by the Commission’s race-based discrimination. \n212.  Senate Equal Protection Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law other than the \njudicial relief sought here. Implementation of the redistricted Senate Districts will irreparably harm \nSenate Equal Protection Plaintiffs by violating their constitutional and statutory rights. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully request this Court: \nA.  Declare that the and House and Senate District maps violate Section 2 of the Voting \nRights Act (Counts I – II) and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth \nAmendment to the United States Constitution (Counts III – VI); \nB.  Establish a reasonable deadline by which Defendants must redraw the House and \nSenate  District  maps  and/or  adopt  Plaintiffs’  proposed  Remedy  Map,  or, \nalternatively, should Defendants fail to meet the Court’s deadline, that the Court \nassume jurisdiction, appoint a special master, and draw constitutionally compliant \nHouse and Senate District maps; \n69 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 8,  PageID.152   Filed 04/13/22   Page 70 of 70\n \nC.  Award Plaintiffs their costs, expenses, disbursements, and reasonable attorneys’ \nfees incurred as a result of filing this action to defend their constitutionally and \nstatutorily protected voting rights, in accordance with 52 U.S.C. § 10310(e); \nD.

Twenty  Michigan  voters  argue  that  the  State’s  new \nlegislative districts have been racially gerrymandered.  They bring claims under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 \nand Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, 52 U.S.C. § 10301, seeking declaratory and injunctive \nrelief.  Michigan’s Secretary of State filed this motion to dismiss, arguing that she lacks any \nmeaningful connection to the new districting plans. We deny the motion.  \nI. \n  In November 2018, Michigan voters approved a state constitutional amendment that shifted \nthe power to draw state legislative districts from the legislature to the “Michigan Independent \nCitizens Redistricting Commission.”  Mich. Const. art. IV, §6. The amendment also directed the \nMichigan Secretary of State to serve as the Commission’s non-voting secretary.  Id. at §6(4).  In \n2021, the Commission redesigned the districts for the State Senate and House of Representatives.  \nThe Secretary of State implemented the Commission’s plans by updating the State’s “qualified \nvoter file,” thereby placing voters into the new districts. Plaintiffs then brought this suit against \nthe Secretary of State, the Commission, and each of the Commissioners in their official capacities, \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 29,  PageID.387   Filed 09/21/22   Page 2 of 4\nchallenging the new plans under the Voting Rights Act and the federal Equal Protection Clause.  \nThe Secretary now moves to dismiss the complaint for lack of standing and failure to state a claim. \nII. \nA. \nThe Secretary argues primarily that the plaintiffs lack standing to sue her.  “We take as true \nthe well-pleaded allegations in the complaint and ask whether plaintiffs plausibly alleged their \nstanding to sue.” Universal Life Church Monastery Storehouse v. Nabors, 35 F.4th 1021, 1031 \n(6th Cir. 2022). Standing has three elements: (i) an injury in fact that is (ii) fairly traceable to the \ndefendant’s conduct and (iii) redressable by a favorable decision. Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, \n504 U.S. 555, 560-61 (1992). Plaintiffs must establish standing separately as to each claim, as to \neach defendant, and as to each form of relief sought. See Universal Life Church, 35 F.4th at 1031.   \nHere, the Secretary concedes that the plaintiffs have adequately pled an injury in fact, \nnamely the alleged abridgement on racial grounds of their right to vote.  She focuses on the second \nelement of standing and argues that the plaintiffs’ injury cannot be fairly traced to her actions, \nwhich she characterizes as merely “administrative.”  But the Secretary is Michigan’s “chief \nelection officer.”  Mich. Comp. Laws §168.21.  Only she can place voters in the districts \nestablished  by  the  Commission.    Mich.  Comp.  Laws  §168.509o(1).    And  the  Secretary \nacknowledges that she implemented the districting plans at issue here by updating the State’s \nqualified-voter file.  Had she not done so, the plaintiffs would not have been placed in the new, \nallegedly  unlawful  districts.    Thus,  the  plaintiffs  allege,  they  find  themselves  in  racially \ngerrymandered districts because the Secretary put them there.  Hence their alleged injury is \ntraceable to her.  \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 29,  PageID.388   Filed 09/21/22   Page 3 of 4\nThe Secretary also argues that the plaintiffs’ injury is not redressable in a lawsuit against \nher in particular.  Specifically, she says that the plaintiffs have chosen the wrong defendant, since \nthe Commission alone can draw new legislative districts.  But the Commission’s maps are \nmeaningless unless the Secretary implements them.  Cf. Lavin v. Husted, 689 F.3d 543, 546 (6th \nCir. 2012).  Thus, if the plaintiffs prove that the current district plan is unlawful, they could seek \nto enjoin her to implement a lawful one.  See Universal Life Church, 35 F.4th at 1032.  The \nplaintiffs therefore have standing to sue her. \nB.  \n  The Secretary argues on similar grounds that she is entitled to immunity under the Eleventh \nAmendment and that the plaintiffs have failed to state a claim against her under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.  \nThese arguments are meritless. Sovereign immunity “does not stand in the way of a lawsuit against \na public official actively involved with administering the alleged violation.”  McNeil v. Cmty. \nProb. Serv’s., LLC., 945 F.3d 991, 995 (6th Cir. 2019) (internal quotation marks omitted).  And a \nstate official who by virtue of her office has “some connection with the alleged unconstitutional \nact or conduct” is a proper defendant in a § 1983 action.  See Top Flight Entertainment, Ltd. v. \nSchuette, 729 F.3d 623, 634 (6th Cir. 2013).  The Secretary concedes that she has an active role in \nthe implementation of new legislative districts.  Hence she is a proper defendant here.  See McNeil, \n945 F.3d at 995. \n  Finally, the Secretary points out that the plaintiffs could obtain complete relief even if she \nwere not a defendant in this case.  That may be true, but it is irrelevant.  The plaintiffs “are free to \nstructure their complaint as they wish.”  McNeil, 945 F.3d at 996.  Absent some other bar, they are \nfree to sue the Secretary.

The  Michigan  Independent  Citizens  Redistricting  Commission  (hereafter  the \n“Commission”) is comprised of thirteen citizens of this State who are charged with the exclusive \nauthority  to  adopt  district  boundaries  for  the  Michigan  Senate  and  Michigan  House  of \nRepresentatives.   \n2.  On December 28, 2021, the Commission adopted district boundary maps for the \nMichigan Senate and Michigan House of Representatives. \n3.  The Commission drew Michigan Senate Districts 1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 10, and 12 (hereafter \nthe “Senate Districts” and/or the “Linden Plan”) and Michigan House of Representatives Districts  \n2, 8, 10, 11, 13, 14, 16, and 26 (hereafter the “House Districts” and/or the “Hickory Plan”) \n(collectively  referred to  as the “Districts”, and/or the “District  Plans”, and/or some similar \nvariation thereof) in violation of Section 2 of the federal Voting Rights Act, 52 U.S.C. § 10301, \n(hereafter “VRA”) and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United \nStates Constitution, U.S. Const. amend. XIV, § 1 (hereafter “Equal Protection Clause”). \n4.  For nearly a half-century, the Senate and House district maps located in southeast \nMichigan were drawn such that the Black voting age populations (hereafter “BVAPs”) were \nsufficiently above 50% in order to comply with the VRA, and specifically to ensure that Black \nvoters would have the opportunity to elect their candidates of choice. \n5.  The Commission has deprived Black voters in the surrounding area of Metropolitan \nDetroit (hereafter “Metro Detroit”)1 of this protected opportunity.  \n                                                 \n1 The specific House and Senate Districts relevant to this action are located within this area.  \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-SJB   ECF No. 1,  PageID.4   Filed 03/23/22   Page 4 of 48\n \n6.  The Commission reduced the amount of Black voter majority-minority House \nDistricts (i.e., districts with BVAPs over 50%) from ten (10) to six (6). \n7.   The Commission reduced the amount of Black voter majority-minority Senate \nDistricts from two (2) to complete elimination (0). \n8.  The Commission created the Senate and House Districts  with race being the \npredominant consideration. \n9.  Compliance with the applicable laws and standards was neither impossible nor \nonerous. Plaintiffs will provide an illustrative remedy map in the course of these proceedings that \nwill show the Commission had ample ability to draw the Districts in such a way to comply with \nthe United States Constitution, Section 2 of the VRA, and the Michigan Constitution. \n10.  Because the Commission deprived each of them their voting rights secured under \nSection 2 of the VRA and the Equal Protection Clause, Plaintiffs bring this Complaint for \ndeclaratory relief and request that this Court order the maps be reconfigured to comply with \napplicable law. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n11.  Jurisdiction is proper with this Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331 and 28 U.S.C. \n§ 1343.

Venue is proper as one or more of the Defendants resides in this District. 28 U.S.C. \n§ 1391(b). \nTHREE-JUDGE COURT REQUESTED \n13.   A three-judge panel to hear and determine this case is proper pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \n§ 2284. “A district court of three judges shall be convened . . . when an action is filed challenging \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-SJB   ECF No. 1,  PageID.5   Filed 03/23/22   Page 5 of 48\n \nthe constitutionality of the apportionment of congressional districts or the apportionment of any \nstatewide legislative body.” 28 U.S.C. § 2284(a). \nPARTIES \n14.

Article I, Section 2 of the United States Constitution provides that the State of \nMichigan has the “primary responsibility for apportionment of their federal congressional and state \nlegislative districts.” Growe v. Emison, 507 U.S. 25, 34 (1993) (citing U.S. Const. art. I, § 2).   \n45.  Prior  to  2018,  the  Michigan  Legislature  (hereafter  the  “Legislature”)  was \nresponsible for adopting congressional and state legislature district boundaries. Mich. Const. art. \nIV, § 6(1).  \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-SJB   ECF No. 1,  PageID.9   Filed 03/23/22   Page 9 of 48\n \n46.  The Michigan legislative districts were redrawn following the release of the 2010 \nUnited States Census (hereafter the “2010 Districts”).  \n47.  The 2010 Districts were effective until the Commission adopted the Hickory and \nLinden Plans on December 28, 2021.  \n48.  The 2010 Districts relevant to this action are largely contained within county lines, \nare extremely compact, and result in the creation of multiple Black voter majority-minority \ndistricts.  \n49.  The below maps represent the BVAP and white voting age population (hereafter \n“WVAP”) for Detroit voting precincts in the 2020 election.2  \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n2 These maps cover both the House and Senate Districts. \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-SJB   ECF No. 1,  PageID.10   Filed 03/23/22   Page 10 of 48\n \nThe Hickory Plan \n50.  Of the eighteen (18) highest BVAP 2010 House Districts in the area surrounding \nMetro Detroit, ten (10) were Black voter majority-minority districts.  \n51.  Black voters in these 2010 House Districts were given an adequate opportunity to \nelect the candidate of their choice. \n52.  The Commission did not think including as many Black voter majority-minority \ndistricts was as important when it adopted the Hickory Plan, reducing this amount to six (6). \n53.  The Commission significantly lowered the BVAP of the eighteen (18) highest \nBVAPs House Districts near Metro Detroit.  \n54.  In crafting the Hickory Plan, the Commission lowered the BVAP from Districts \nwith an already high BVAP and redistricted Black voters to Districts with far lower BVAPs. \n \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-SJB   ECF No. 1,  PageID.11   Filed 03/23/22   Page 11 of 48\n \n \n \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-SJB   ECF No. 1,  PageID.12   Filed 03/23/22   Page 12 of 48\n \n   \nThe Linden Plan \n55.  Of the ten (10) highest BVAP 2010 Senate Districts in the area surrounding Metro \nDetroit, two (2) were Black voter majority-minority districts. \n56.  Black voters in these 2010 Senate Districts were given an adequate opportunity to \nelect the candidate of their choice. \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-SJB   ECF No. 1,  PageID.13   Filed 03/23/22   Page 13 of 48\n \n57.  During the span of elections from 2012-2020, each of these two (2) Senate Districts \nsaw the Black voter candidate of choice win the Democratic Party Primary Election in addition to \nthe general election. \n58.  The Commission decided to eliminate all of the Black voter majority-minority \ndistricts when it adopted the Linden Plan. \n59.  As it did with the Hickory Plan, the Commission significantly lowered the BVAP \nof the ten (10) highest BVAPs Senate Districts near Metro Detroit. \n60.  District BVAPs in The Linden Plan are reduced by keeping same number of \nDistricts with a BVAP of at least 40% while eliminating those above a BVAP over 46%. \n61.  The Commission redistricted Black voters outward from the City of Detroit towards \nand into suburban areas with a traditionally higher WVAP. \n \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-SJB   ECF No. 1,  PageID.14   Filed 03/23/22   Page 14 of 48\n \n    \n  \n        \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-SJB   ECF No. 1,  PageID.15   Filed 03/23/22   Page 15 of 48\n \n \n62.  The above maps and charts illustrate that the Commission’s intentions in creating \nthe Linden Plan was to replace Black voter majority-minority districts with so-called “influence \ndistricts.” \nThe Commission’s Unlawful Drawing Process   \n63.  Pursuant to the 2018 ballot proposal, the Michigan Constitution was amended to \nestablish the Commission (hereafter the “Amendment”). Mich. Const. art. IV, § 6(1). \n64.  According to the United States Census Bureau, 61.6% of Michigan voters identified \ntheir race as white alone in 2020. Another 12.4% identified their race as Black alone, while 18.7% \nidentified their ethnicity as Hispanic. Asian residents constituted 6% of the population, while \nAmerican Indians constituted 1.1% of the population. Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders were 0.2% \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-SJB   ECF No. 1,  PageID.16   Filed 03/23/22   Page 16 of 48\n \nof  the  population.  8.4%  of  residents  identified  as  “Some  Other  Race,”  while  10.2%  of \nMichiganders responded that they identified with two or more races.3  \n65.  Michigan’s non-white population is heavily concentrated in the Metro Detroit area, \nparticularly western Detroit, in southern Wayne County, and around Pontiac. \n66.  The Commission considered six total proposed Senate District plans prior to \nadopting the Linden Plan.4   \n67.  The Commission considered four total proposed House District plans prior to \nadopting the Hickory Plan.5   \n68.  The Commission hired Dr. Lisa Handley, a consultant with the ACE Electoral \nKnowledge Network,6 to determine if the proposed maps would comply with Section 2 of the \nVRA. \n69.  In  her  report  (hereafter  the  “Handley  Report”),  Dr.  Handley  informed  the \nCommission that a district with a 35% - 40% BVAP would allow Black voters in the area \nsurrounding Metro Detroit to elect the candidate of their choice.7 \n                                                 \n3 Note that these numbers do not add up to 100, because “Hispanic” is considered a separate, \nnon-racial category.  Thus, a Michigan resident may identify as Hispanic White, non-Hispanic \nWhite, Hispanic Black, non-Hispanic Black, and so forth. \n4 https://www.michigan.gov/micrc/0,10083,7-418-107190_109075---,00.html \n5 https://www.michigan.gov/micrc/0,10083,7-418-107190_109075---,00.html \n6 https://aceproject.org/electoral-advice/author/handley \n7  Handley, Lisa, Report to the Michigan Independent Citizens Redistricting Commission \n(hereafter “Handley Report”), p. 22. \nhttps://www.michigan.gov/documents/micrc/MICRC_Dr_Handley_Final_Report_744296_7.pdf \n \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-SJB   ECF No. 1,  PageID.17   Filed 03/23/22   Page 17 of 48\n \n70.  Accepting the Handley Report’s threshold for BVAPs, the Commission lowered \nthe amount of Black voter majority-minority House districts from ten (10) to six (6). The Linden \nPlan eliminates all Black voter majority-minority Senate districts.  \n \n \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-SJB   ECF No. 1,  PageID.18   Filed 03/23/22   Page 18 of 48\n \n   \n71.  Per the findings from the Handley Report, the Commission replaced the deleted \nBlack voter majority-minority House and Senate Districts with so-called “Minority Opportunity \nDistricts.”8 \n72.  These Districts are also known, per Defendant Benson, as “influence districts.” \n73.  The Commission’s Minority Opportunity Districts intentionally lowered BVAP by \nplacing Black voters in Districts where it is predicted that the District majority will vote for the \nBlack voter candidate of choice. The Handley Report describes this as “white crossover voting.”9   \n74.  White crossover voting is accomplished by “cracking” or “unpacking” Black voters \ninto the desired Districts. See, i.e., Gill v. Whitford, 138 S. Ct. 1916, 1920, 201 L. Ed. 2d 313 \n(2018). \n                                                 \n8 Handley Report at pp. 17-18.  \n9 Id. at p. 19. \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-SJB   ECF No. 1,  PageID.19   Filed 03/23/22   Page 19 of 48\n \n75.  As noted by Defendant Benson, there are “dangers in allowing influence districts \nto replace majority-minority districts[.]”10 Specifically, Defendant Benson has explained that \nwhile some “believe that a decrease in racially polarized voting makes it possible for communities \nof color to elect their candidates of choice by building coalitions with white voters, [Professor \nPamela] Karlan argues it is still nearly impossible for minority candidates to elect the candidate of \ntheir choice outside of districts where more than 50% of the voting age population is a combination \nof minority groups. Karlan’s arguments are supported by current empirical evidence.”11 That’s \nwhy Defendant Benson “proposed a ban on reductions below 55% of covered minority populations \nin any currently majority-minority district, unless the jurisdiction can present convincing evidence \nthat racially polarized voting is nonexistent or that minority voters’ participation rates will remain \nunaffected.”12  \n76.  The  decision  and  support  for  relying  on  white  cross  over  voting  is  flawed, \nspeculative, contrary to Sixth Circuit precedent, and will deny Black voters the opportunity to elect \ntheir candidate of their choice.  \n77.  The Commission adopted the approach from the Handley Report despite other \nreadily available data.  \na.  A non-partisan report conducted by the Michigan State University Institute for \nPublic Policy and Social Research (the “MSU Report”) found that most of the \ncomputer-generated models available to the Commission could “feature at least \n                                                 \n10 Turning Lemons into Lemonade: Making Georgia v.

The MSU Report found that most of the computer-generated models available to \nthe Commission could feature “at least two and probably three Michigan Senate” \nmajority-minority districts.14 \n78.  The Handley Report relies on conclusions on general election data where white \ncandidates are assumed to be the Black voter candidate of choice. In theory white voters vote as a \nbloc  to  elect  the  Black  voter  candidate  of  choice,  thus  resulting  in  outcomes  not  racially \npolarized.15  \n79.  These models do not consider elections that feature a Black candidate on the ballot \nrunning against the presumed white voter candidate of choice.  \n80.  The Handley Report fails to consider the possibility of racial polarization resulting \nin white-block voting where the candidate of choice for Black voters is non-white. \n81.  The 2018 Michigan Gubernational Democratic Primary provides an example. \na.  In the Metro Detroit area, Gretchen Whitmer was the candidate of choice among \nwhite voters, winning upwards of 60% of their vote in most of the House \nDistricts.  \nb.  On the other hand, Sri Thanedar, who is non-white, was the Black voter \ncandidate of choice and received little support from white voters in the same \nDistricts. \n                                                 \n13 Michigan Redistricting Map Analysis, Institute for Public Policy and Social Research \n(hereafter“MSU Report”), at p. 119 https://ippsr.msu.edu/sites/default/files/SOSS/data-\npublications/FINALInterimReportWebUpdated22-compressed.pdf \n14 Id. at p. 109. \n15 Handley Report at pp. 19-21. \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-SJB   ECF No. 1,  PageID.21   Filed 03/23/22   Page 21 of 48\n \nc.  Thanedar carried House Districts 4, 5, 7, 8, and 9. When evaluating these results \nunder the Hickory Plan, Thanedar does not prevail in any of these Districts \nbecause the BVAP is too low. \nd.  Thus, adopting the white crossover theory can result in Black voters seeing their \nvote diluted and greatly increasing the probability that they will not have the \nadequate opportunity to elect the candidate of their choice.   \n82.  The Sixth Circuit has already squarely rejected the Commission’s application of the \nusing the white crossover theory to evaluate whether Black voters can elect the candidate of their \nchoice.  \n83.  Data that considers elections featuring Black or non-white candidates provides \nevidence that is most probative. Rural W. Tennessee Afr.-Am. Affs. Council v. Sundquist, 209 F.3d \n835, 837 (6th Cir. 2000).  \na.  In this case, the Sixth Circuit held that the election outcomes of Black candidates \nvs. white candidates offers more probative evidence of vote dilution than the \noutcomes of elections featuring white candidate vs. other white candidates. Id. \nb.  Stated differently, in determining whether a white voter majority in a district \nvotes sufficiently as a bloc to enable it to usually defeat the Black voter’s \npreferred candidate, it is best to examine how Black candidates fair in elections \nfeaturing white candidates.  \nc.  If the Black candidate prevails more often, there is not likely a white voter voting \nblock preventing Black voters an adequate opportunity to elect the candidate of \nchoice.  \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-SJB   ECF No. 1,  PageID.22   Filed 03/23/22   Page 22 of 48\n \nd.  But, as was the case in the Gubernatorial Democratic Primary Election of 2018, \nracially polarized elections resulting in the routine victory of the white voter \ncandidate of choice shows that Black voters cannot elect their candidate of \nchoice.   \n84.  The Handley Report, and therefore the Commission, also erroneously relies on data \nfrom general elections. General election data is irrelevant and unreliable in determining if Black \nvoters have an adequate opportunity to elect their candidate of choice.  \n85.  Each of the Districts with a BVAP of 35% or higher routinely and overwhelmingly \nelects the Democratic candidate in the general election.  \n86.  Because  Black  voters  have  historically  and  consistently  voted  cohesively  for \nDemocratic candidates, the Black candidate of choice will almost certainly win the general \nelection. \n87.  Thus, the proper analysis is whether the Black voter candidate of choice can prevail \nin a Democratic Primary Election.  \n88.  In the course of these proceedings, Plaintiffs will submit an expert report by Sean \nP. Trende (hereafter “Expert Report), which uses a statistical technique known as ecological \nregression to examine how varying levels of BVAP may predict the success rate of the Black voter \ncandidate of choice in a Democratic Primary Election.  \n89.  While the Handley Report engages in similar analysis to estimate group voting \nbehavior from aggregate data, it fails to consider, let alone justify the BVAPs levels in the Hickory \nand Linden Plans. \n90.  This  is  especially  troublesome  given  the  increased  difficulty  facing  Black \ncandidates in Democratic Primary Elections in these Districts. \n22 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-SJB   ECF No. 1,  PageID.23   Filed 03/23/22   Page 23 of 48\n \n91.  Yet the Commission relies on BVAP levels with no proven record of success in \nelecting Black candidates of choice.  \na.  The 2010 House District Maps contain one (1) District with a BVAP between 36% \nand 53%. \ni.  The Hickory Plan features ten (10) Districts with a BVAP between \n36% and 53%, with six (6) Districts exceeding 53%. \nb.  The 2010 Senate District Maps contain only one (1) District with a BVAP between \n35.5% and 47%. \ni.  The Linden Plan features six (6) Districts with BVAP level between \n35.5% and 47%. \n92.  The Commission’s decision to lower the BVAP from the 2010 District Maps across \nthe board in the Hickory and Linden Plans will result in Black candidates struggling to find success \nin future elections. \n93.   As a result, Black voters will not have an adequate opportunity to elect the \ncandidate of their choice. \n94.  Examining past Democratic Primary Elections illustrates this. \nSenate Primary Elections \n95.  A Black voter candidate of choice (Vincent Gregory) prevailed in District 11 \n(35.5% BVAP) during the 2014 Democratic Senate Primary Election by 0.4% over the white \ncandidates. \n96.  However, Senator Gregory’s vote share mirrored the Black voter share of the \nelectorate. In keeping with Sixth Circuit precedent and assigning probative value to candidate race, \n23 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-SJB   ECF No. 1,  PageID.24   Filed 03/23/22   Page 24 of 48\n \nit is likely that had the BVAP been lower, or had the white voter vote been less divided between \nthe two white candidates, Senator Gregory would not have prevailed. \n97.  In District 4 (47% BVAP), the Black candidate (Virgil Smith) prevailed narrowly \nover a Middle Eastern candidate and a white candidate in the 2014 Democratic Senate Primary \nElection. But again, his vote share followed the BVAP closely. If the BVAP were lower than 47%, \na Black candidate may have lost against unified opposition. \n98.  District 5 contained the highest BVAP (54.3%) and featured three (3) Black \ncandidates. Yet the Black voter candidate of choice did not prevail in 2014 Democratic Primary \nElection. The total vote share for the Black candidates was 61%, about seven (7) points higher \nthan the BVAP, suggesting that a BVAP of less than 43% would make it difficult for Black \ncandidates to prevail. \n99.  In the 2018 Democratic Senate Primary Election, District 1 (44.7% BVAP) saw the \nwhite voter candidate of choice (who the Handley Report estimates won 77% of the white vote but \njust 23% of the Black vote) won a near-majority of the vote. Note that this District has a higher \nBVAP than all but one of the newly drawn Senate Districts. \n100.  The following table summarizes Democratic Senate Primary Elections in the Metro \nDetroit area that features a competitive race and racial polarization amongst the electorate: \n24 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-SJB   ECF No. 1,  PageID.25   Filed 03/23/22   Page 25 of 48\n \n \n101.  This table shows three (3) occasions where the Black voter candidate of choice \nprevailed. These victories were not by large margins. The vote share for the Black voter candidate \nof choice closely mirrored the respective BVAPs. \n102.  The totality of this evidence illustrates that the Black voter candidate of choice has \nnot been successful in any racially polarized election in the greater Metro Detroit area where the \nBVAP is below 47% and have even lost where the BVAP exceeds this percentage. \n103.  Because the Linden Plan creates only two (2) districts with BVAP over 42% and \ndoes not create any district with a BVAP that has historically allowed Black candidates to succeed \nin Democratic Senate Primary Elections, it will deprive Black voters an adequate opportunity to \nelect their candidate of choice. \nHouse Primary Elections \n104.  There is no evidence to conclude that the Black voter candidate of choice can \nroutinely prevail in a racially polarized Democratic House Primary Election in a district with a \nBVAP below 47%. Yet the Hickory Plan creates twelve (12) Districts with a BVAP range from \n36% to 47%. \n25 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-SJB   ECF No. 1,  PageID.26   Filed 03/23/22   Page 26 of 48\n \n105.  To help justify the BVAP of these districts the Commission relied on a single \nexample from the Handley Report, the 2018 District 11 Democratic House Primary Election. The \nBlack voter candidate of choice was an incumbent, who was initially selected by district delegates \nvia special election. \n106.  While historical examples from House Democratic Primary Elections are not as \nconclusive because they often feature multiple candidates, it is clear that Black voters already face \ndifficulty in electing the candidate of their choice.  \n107.   For example, the 2018 Democratic House District 2 Primary Election (60.3% \nBVAP), featured a crowded field of candidates. The winner prevailed with nearly 67% white voter \nsupport and roughly 10% of support from Black voters. Here, white voters coalesced behind a \ncandidate while Black voters spread their support among multiple candidates. \n108.  Yet, the Commission lowered the BVAP across the board despite the data from \nprevious elections showing that Black voters cannot routinely elect their candidate of choice in \nDistricts with BVAPs from 30% to roughly 45%, and still may struggle in Districts in the 50% \nrange. \nThe Commission’s Predominant Consideration of Race \n109.  The Amendment created rules of which the Commission must adhere to when \ncreating each district. Article IV, Section 6(13) of the Michigan Constitution provides that the \ncommissioners must abide “by the following criteria in proposing and adopting each plan, in order \nof priority”:  \nA.  Districts shall be of equal population as mandated by the United \nStates  Constitution,  and  shall  be  geographically  contiguous. \nIsland areas are considered to be contiguous by land to the \ncounty of which they are a part. \nB.  Districts  shall  reflect  the  state’s  diverse  population  and \ncommunities of interest. Communities of interest may include, \n26 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-SJB   ECF No. 1,  PageID.27   Filed 03/23/22   Page 27 of 48\n \nbut shall not be limited to, populations that share cultural or \nhistorical characteristics or economic interests. Communities of \ninterest  do  not  include  relationships  with  political  parties, \nincumbents, or political candidates. \nC.  Districts shall not provide a disproportionate advantage to any \npolitical party. A disproportionate advantage to a political party \nshall  be  determined  using  accepted  measures  of  partisan \nfairness. \nD.  Districts shall not favor or disfavor an incumbent elected official \nor a candidate. \nE.  Districts shall reflect consideration of county, city, and township \nboundaries. \nF.  Districts shall be reasonably compact. \n110.  As will be shown by the simulation analysis described in Plaintiffs’ forthcoming \nExpert Report, the Commission clearly drew the House and Senate District maps with race as the \npredominant consideration over others. \n111.  This analysis involves generating numerous models (an “ensemble”) of voting \ndistrict maps. The ensemble is created without reference to a particular fixed factor, also known \nas a constraint of interest. In other words, it also allows the user to specify constraints under which \ndistrict lines are drawn, such as compactness, population equality, and respect for municipal lines. \nThe ensemble is then compared to the reference maps to determine if the constraint of interest was \nconsidered when created. \n112.  For example, if a district map resembles the ensemble maps without reference to a \nspecific constraint of interest factor, it is a reasonable conclusion that it was not a dominant \nconsideration by the Commission.  If, however, the ensemble is an outlier when compared to the \nCommission’s drawing, the logical conclusion is that the Commission’s maps were likely drawn \nwith respect to that factor. \n27 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-SJB   ECF No. 1,  PageID.28   Filed 03/23/22   Page 28 of 48\n \n113.  Plaintiffs’ analysis generated models as “race blind.” In other words, racial data \nwas tracked but was not used as a constraint. The results show that the Hickory and Linden Plans \nwere drawn as race as the predominant consideration over the criteria in Section 6(13) and other \ntraditional race-neutral considerations.  \nRacial Predominance in the Hickory Plan \n114.  To ensure that the ensemble generated the same number of districts as the Hickory \nPlan and to reflect the basic locations of potential race-based districting, Plaintiffs’ analysis \nseparates all Michigan House Districts into three divisions. The first division includes all precincts \nlocated within districts that were contained, in whole or in part, in Wayne, Macomb, Oakland, \nMonroe or Washtenaw counties. House Districts 1-33, 46-49, 51-63, 65, and 66 were included in \nthis division. Two House Districts located in the northwest portion of Oakland were excluded as \ncore districts for the second division. \n115.  The results reveal that House Districts 2, 8, 10, 11, 13, 14, 16, and 26 were drawn \nwith race as the predominate factor.  \n116.  A district drawn without consideration of race would ordinarily yield a BVAP \nbetween 93% and 94.5%. The lowest BVAP in a racially neutrally drawn district would yield a \nBVAP of 77.5%, this representing the outlier. \n117.  The Hickory Plan’s highest district BVAP generated to 56.8%, roughly fourteen \n(14) standard deviations away from the average BVAP of the highest BVAP map produced in the \nensemble. \n118.  The Hickory Plan should have without question included a seventh Black voter \nmajority-minority District. It would be reasonable to draw an eighth or a ninth. Instead, the Hickory \n28 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-SJB   ECF No. 1,  PageID.29   Filed 03/23/22   Page 29 of 48\n \nPlan Districts with the seventh, eighth, and ninth highest BVAPs are 47%, 44%, and 44% Black, \nrespectively. \n119.  A tenth Black voter majority-minority could also be drawn, though it would \nrepresent an outlier. \n120.  Districts 10-21 include a much higher WVAP than would be expected if drawn with \nracially neutral considerations. \n121.  Thus, the Hickory Plan Districts with higher BVAPs were constructed with racial \nconsiderations as the predominant factor. However, the Hickory Plan Districts with a higher \nWVAP were drawn with racially neutral considerations. \n122.  The Commission moved white voters from Districts with a moderate BVAP to \nDistricts with a high BVAP to dilute Black voter voting strength. \nRacial Predominance in the Linden Plan \n123.  Analysis of the Linden Plan reveals the same conclusion. Had race not been a \npredominant consideration, the Linden Plan would have produced at least three Black voter \nmajority-minority districts from Wayne and adjoining counties. Instead, it produced zero. \n124.  Districts in the Linden Plan with the four highest BVAPs significantly decreased, \nwhile the next five districts saw an increase in WVAP.  \n125.  When  ensembles  were  adjusted  to  consider  other  race-neutral  factors,  racial \nconsiderations were still present in the Linden Plan. \nPublic Comments from Commissioners \n126.  Comments from several commissioners during the meeting to adopt to Hickory and \nLinden Plans likewise reveal that the Districts were drawn with race as the predominant factor. \n29 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-SJB   ECF No. 1,  PageID.30   Filed 03/23/22   Page 30 of 48\n \n127.  Defendant Lange expressed that more consideration was given to “certain groups” \nsuch that the Districts may have issues with VRA compliance.16  \n128.  Agreeing  with  Defendant  Lange's  comment,  Defendant  Wagner  proposed  the \nCommission spend more time on developing the Hickory Plan.17 \n129.  In Defendant Kellom’s view “I also happen to think we could do better for the City \nof Detroit and for people of color all over the State of Michigan in terms of representation to have \na more equitable map.”18  \n130.  Defendant Szetela remarked that the Commission “received very vigorous public \ncomment particularly around VRA issues and particularly with primaries and democratic primaries \nand are these maps representative and do they actually provide the Black community in Detroit \nwith the ability to elect.”19 \n131.  Following public comment, Defendant Lange summarized by saying “I think the \nconsensus with the public comment is everybody wants the maps to be fair. They want more \nconsideration given to communities of interest. More consideration given to VRA.”20 \nCOUNT I  \nViolation of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act  \n(House Districts 2, 8, 10, 11, 13, 14, 16, and 26) \n \n132.

The VRA prohibits any “State or political subdivision” to impose, or cause to be \napplied, any voting “standard, practice, or procedure” which “results in a denial or abridgment of \nany right of any citizen of the United States to vote on account of race or color.” 52 USC § 10301. \n134.  To prevail on a claim under Section 2 of the VRA, Plaintiffs have the burden to \nprove the following three preconditions, as articulated by the United States Supreme Court in \nThornburg v. Gingles, 478 U.S. 30, 50-51 (1986): 1) that the minority group is “sufficiently large \nand geographically compact to constitute a majority in a single-member district,” 2) that the \nminority group is “politically cohesive,” and 3) that the rest of the electorate, or the white majority, \nvotes sufficiently cohesively as a bloc to defeat the candidate preferred by the minority.  \n135.  Once  these  preconditions  are  established,  courts  examine  the  totality  of \ncircumstances. Id.  \n136.  Factors encompassing the totality of the circumstances include, but are not limited \nto, the extent to which the minority group members are affected by discrimination in education, \nemployment and health, and the extent to which discrimination hinders effective participation in \nelections. Id. at 36-37. \n137.  Plaintiffs have satisfied the first precondition.  \n138.  Prior to the Hickory Plan, there were ten (10) Black voter majority-minority House \nDistricts in the Metro Detroit Area, providing Black voters the opportunity to elect candidates of \ntheir choice and facilitating the House’s membership interests in the Michigan Legislative Black \nCaucus.  \n139.  The Commission lowered this amount to six (6) Districts even though they could \nhave feasibly drafted ten (10). \n31 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-SJB   ECF No. 1,  PageID.32   Filed 03/23/22   Page 32 of 48\n \n140.  Plaintiffs have also established the second precondition. Historically, Michigan \nBlack  voters  have  voted  cohesively,  first  in  favor  of  the  pro-abolitionist  Republican  Party \nfollowing the Civil War, and then transitioning to the Democrat Party following the New Deal in \nthe 1930s and increasing with the civil rights legislation enacted by United States Presidents John \nF. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Jonson, to the point that by 2016, only 8% of Black voters identified \nas Republicans, and 70% as Democrats. In the 2016 Presidential Election, 88% of Black voters \nvoted for the Democratic nominee.21 \n141.  Michigan Black voters have voted “politically cohesively,” as exhibited by the fact \nthat 94% of Detroit electorate voted for Democratic nominee in the 2020 Presidential Election. \nBlack voters encompass 71% of Detroit’s population.  The Democratic nominee received 50.6% \nstatewide.22  \n142.  The political cohesiveness is further exemplified by the fact that Black voters \naccount for 14% of Michigan’s statewide population, but account 20% of Democratic vote.23  \n143.  The Commission has even confirmed the political cohesiveness of Michigan Black \nvoters, stating in a memorandum prepared by its attorney, that “[p]ursuant to the VRA and Gingles, \nDr. Lisa Handley conducted a racially polarized voting analysis for the Michigan Independent \n                                                 \n21 See Black Party Affiliation, BLACK DEMOGRAPHICS: THE AFRICAN AMERICAN POPULATION, \n(last accessed Feb. 1, 2022), https://blackdemographics.com/culture/black-politics/. \n22 Warikoo, Niraj, Black Voters in Detroit key for Joe Biden and Gary Peters’ Victories, \nAdvocates Say, DETROIT FREE PRESS, (Pub.

Most importantly, there is cohesive voting among Black voters in favor the Black \nor non-white candidate in Democratic Primary Elections in House Districts 2, 8, 10, 11, 13, 14, \n16, and 26. \n145.  The  third  precondition  is  also  met.  As  discussed  herein  and  detailed  in  the \nforthcoming Expert Report, white voters generally vote as a bloc to defeat Black voters’ candidate \nof choice, here being the Black candidate in Democratic Primary Elections.   \n146.  Because each of the Districts with a BVAP of at least 35% historically elects \nDemocratic candidates at an overwhelming rate, the proper analysis is whether the Black voter \ncandidate of choice can prevail in a Houses Democratic Primary Election. \n147.  The Commission’s actions in lowering the BVAP in each of these Districts dilutes \nthe ability of Plaintiffs’ ability to elect candidates of their choice in future House Democratic \nPrimary Elections. \n148.  The totality of the circumstances likewise establishes that the House Districts \nviolate Section 2 of the VRA. Black voters have historically born the effects of discrimination in \neducation, health, education, and employment opportunities, and continue to bear the effect of this \ndiscrimination, hindering their ability to effectively participate in the political process.  The \nfollowing demonstrate the historical and continuation of racial discrimination and inequality in \nMichigan: \nA.

As a result, Detroit is the most segregated city in the United States, and the \nGreater Detroit Area is the fourth most segregated metropolitan area in the \ncountry. 30 \nG.  Additionally, because property ownership is a primary method of accumulating \nwealth,  denying  ownership  to  Black  persons  can  lead  to  increased  wealth \ndisparity between Black and white persons.31 This in turn affects voting, as \npersons with lower socioeconomic status are less likely to vote. \nH.  Black persons, Indigenous Persons, and Hispanic persons also suffer disparities \nand unequal treatment in education.  These groups are between 13% and 11% \nless likely to obtain a bachelor’s degree than their white counterparts.32 \nI.  At  the  grade  school  lever,  low  income,  urban  public  schools,  which  are \npredominantly Black, suffer from resource disparities.  \n149.

Prior to the Commission’s redistricting, there were two (2) Black voter majority-\nminority Senate Districts in the Metro Detroit Area. \n157.  The Linden Plan eliminates all Black voter majority-minority Senate Districts in \nthis area.  \n158.  The Linden Plan could have included at least three minority-majority districts. \n159.  Thus,  Black  voters  in  these  Senate  Districts  are  sufficiently  large  and \ngeographically compact to produce a majority. \n160.  Plaintiffs have also met the burden of establishing the second precondition.  \n161.  In addition to voting in a politically cohesive matter for Democratic candidates \nnationally, as a state, and in the challenged Senate Districts surrounding Detroit, the data discussed \nherein  shows  Black  voters  vote  in  a  politically-cohesive  manner  for  Black  candidates  in \nDemocratic Primary Elections. The Commission disregarded this.  \n162.  The  third  precondition  is  also  met.  As  discussed  herein  and  detailed  in  the \nforthcoming Expert Report, white voters generally vote as a bloc to defeat Black voters’ candidate \nof choice.   \n163.  Because each of the Districts with a BVAP of at least 35% historically elects \nDemocratic candidates at an overwhelming rate, the proper analysis is whether the Black voter \ncandidate of choice can prevail in a Democratic primary.  \n164.  The Commission’s actions in eliminating Black voter majority-minority Districts \ndilutes the ability of Black voters’ ability to elect candidates of their choice, specifically in future \nDemocratic Primary Elections. \n165.  The  totality  of  circumstances  coupled  with  the  establishment  of  the  three \npreconditions prove Senate Districts 1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 10, and 12 violate Section 2 of the VRA. \n37 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-SJB   ECF No. 1,  PageID.38   Filed 03/23/22   Page 38 of 48\n \nCOUNT III \nViolation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United \nStates Constitution – Racial Gerrymandering \n(House Districts 2, 8, 10, 11, 13, 14, 16, and 26) \n \n166.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference all preceding allegations as if fully restated \nherein. \n167.  Plaintiffs  are  entitled  to  the  equal  protection  of  law  under  the  Fourteenth \nAmendment of the United States Constitution, which provides that no state shall “deny to any \nperson within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.”  \n168.  An Equal Protection violation arises when persons are treated disparately or in an \narbitrary fashion under the law.   \n169.  The Equal Protection Clause prohibits government from treating citizens along \nracial lines, including when it comes creating voting districts. Miller v. Johnson, 515 U.S. 900, \n911, 115 S. Ct. 2475, 2485, 132 L. Ed. 2d 762 (1995). \n170.  Under  the  Equal  Protection  Clause,  district  maps  that  have  been  racial \ngerrymandered  are  “constitutionally  suspect  .  .  .  whether  or  not  the  reason  for  the  racial \nclassification is benign or the purpose remedial.”  Shaw v. Hunt, 517 U.S. 899, 905 (1996).   \n171.  In drafting the House Districts, the Commission subordinated traditional race-\nneutral  principles, such as compactness,  contiguity, and respect  for political  subdivision or \ncommunities to race as the predominant consideration for drawing district lines. See Miller v. \nJohnson, 515 U.S. 900, 915, 115 S.Ct. 2475 (1995); see also Easley v. Cromartie, 532 U.S. 234, \n241, 121 S.Ct. 1452 (2001). \n172.  The  Commission  stacked  Black  voters  into  districts  that  traditionally  have  a \nmajority white VAP with the intent to have the lowest BVAP as could be rationalized. \n38 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-SJB   ECF No. 1,  PageID.39   Filed 03/23/22   Page 39 of 48\n \n173.  The House Districts discriminate against Plaintiffs on the basis of race in one or \nmore of the ways set forth below, each sufficient to demonstrate race-based discrimination used to \ninclude  or  exclude  Plaintiffs  in  these  House  Districts  with  race  being  the  predominant \nconsideration: \n(a) As evidenced by the demographics of the plan as a whole, the Commission drafted the \nHouse Districts with a racially discriminatory purpose; \n(b) The House Districts were drafted with a discriminatory purpose evidenced by the fact \nthat traditional redistricting principles and natural population shifts were ignored in favor \nof a racial classification used to artificially manipulate the BVAP of each district. \ni.  In its analysis of the proposed House Districts, the MSU Report acknowledges \nthat the Commission ignored traditional redistricting principles in forming \noddly shaped, non-compact maps: “Viewers can confirm, by visual inspection, \nthat compactness was not a guiding factor in the design of these maps.”34  \nii.  The MSU report further concludes that the “cross city, cross-county districts,” \nwith “elongated, serrated, tool-like or key-like shapes” and “intertwining” arms \nwere  “racially motivated” to  split  the BVAP that  had existed in  the two \nmajority-Black districts.35   \niii. The “non-compact, earmuff-shaped districts” do not reflect Communities of \nInterest within the state.36  \niv. Furthermore, the House Districts create a large number of districts with large \npopulations of Black voters that nevertheless fall short of creating majority \n                                                 \n34 MSU Report at p. 129. \n35 Id. \n36 Id. at p. 130. \n39 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-SJB   ECF No. 1,  PageID.40   Filed 03/23/22   Page 40 of 48\n \ndistricts by arranging the districts so that Black voters were divided into the \nneighboring suburban areas, thus diluting their voting strength.37 \n(c) Defendants’ purpose in enacting the House Districts, either in whole or in part, was \nmotivated  by  race  and/or  the  goal  of  drawing  House  Districts  with  specific  racial \ncomposition in each district; \ni.  According  to  the  MSU  Report,  the  Hickory  Plan  arranges  the  House \nDistricts with a high BVAP in such a way that “urban Black majorities get \npartially  diluted  to  smaller  majorities  in  these  hybrid  urban-suburban \ndistricts.”38 \n(d) The shape of the House Districts disregards existing county lines and are drawn so \nirrational that they can only be explained as a race-based gerrymander. \n174.  Because  Plaintiffs  have  established  that  the  Commission  used  race  as  the \npredominant factor in creating the House Districts, the redistricting scheme is subject to strict \nscrutiny. Miller, 515 U.S. at 916, 115 S.Ct. 2475.  \n175.  The use of race in creating the House Districts is not narrowly tailored to achieve a \ncompelling governmental interest.  \n176.  The Commission cannot provide adequate justification for its racial discrimination \nagainst Plaintiffs.  \n177.  While remedying past discrimination may serve as a compelling state interest, the \nCommission has not, and cannot, provide strong evidence of such a remedy. See Id. at 922, 115 \n                                                 \n37 Id. at p. 137. \n38 Id. \n40 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-SJB   ECF No. 1,  PageID.41   Filed 03/23/22   Page 41 of 48\n \nS.Ct. 2475. Mere compliance with federal antidiscrimination laws alone will not alone always \nserve as a compelling governmental interest. Id. at 921, 115 S.Ct. 2475.  \n178.  The Commission cannot argue that Section 2 VRA compliance satisfies strict \nscrutiny because the House Districts are not in compliance.  \n179.  The Commission’s’ use of race in drawing the House Districts is not the least \nrestrictive means available to give Plaintiffs an opportunity to participate equally in the political \nprocess. \n180.  Plaintiffs will provide an illustrative remedy map in the course of these proceedings \nthat will show the Commission had ample ability to draw the Districts with less restrictive means \nthat provide Plaintiffs with an opportunity to participate equally in the political process.  \n181.  Plaintiffs have been, and continue to be, denied equal protection under the law and \ninjured by the Commission’s use of race-based discrimination. \n182.  Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law other than the judicial relief sought here. \nImplementation  of  these  House  Districts  will  irreparably  harm  Plaintiffs  by  violating  their \nconstitutional and statutory rights. \nCOUNT IV \nViolation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the \nUnited States Constitution – Racial Gerrymandering  \n(Senate Districts 1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 10, and 12) \n \n183.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference all preceding allegations as if fully restated \nherein.  \n184.  Plaintiffs  are  entitled  to  the  equal  protection  of  law  under  the  Fourteenth \nAmendment of the United States Constitution, which provides that no state shall “deny to any \nperson within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.”  \n41 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-SJB   ECF No. 1,  PageID.42   Filed 03/23/22   Page 42 of 48\n \n185.  An Equal Protection violation arises when persons are treated disparately or in an \narbitrary fashion under the law.   \n186.  The Equal Protection Clause prohibits government from treating citizens along \nracial lines, including when it comes creating voting districts. Miller v. Johnson, 515 U.S. 900, \n911, 115 S. Ct. 2475, 2485, 132 L. Ed. 2d 762 (1995). \n187.  Under  the  Equal  Protection  Clause,  district  maps  that  have  been  racial \ngerrymandered  are  “constitutionally  suspect  .  .  .  whether  or  not  the  reason  for  the  racial \nclassification is benign or the purpose remedial.”  Shaw v. Hunt, 517 U.S. 899, 905 (1996).   \n188.  The  Commission’s  redistricting  of  the  Senate  Districts  discriminates  against \nPlaintiffs on the basis of race in one or more of the ways set forth below, each sufficient to \ndemonstrate race-based discrimination used to include or exclude Plaintiffs from these Senate \nDistricts with race being the predominant consideration: \n(a) The Senate Districts have a discriminatory purpose evidenced by the demographics of \nthe plan as a whole; \n(b) The Senate Districts were drafted with a discriminatory purpose evidenced by the fact \nthat traditional redistricting principles and natural population shifts were ignored in favor \nof a racial classification used to artificially manipulate the BVAP of each district; \ni.  The MSU Report concludes that at least three majority-minority \ndistricts could have been included, yet the Commission included \nnone. Plaintiffs’ forthcoming Expert Report will provide the same \nconclusion.   \nii.  The Commission divides Black voters in a way that creates urban-\nsuburban cross-county districts, thus diluting their vote.   \n42 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-SJB   ECF No. 1,  PageID.43   Filed 03/23/22   Page 43 of 48\n \niii.  According to the MSU Report, the “intent appears to be to create \nmore total  districts” with Black voters, in  an “unconventional” \nway39 to comply with Section 2 of the VRA. \niv.  The MSU Report further expresses that there is insufficient data to \nknow if districts with African-American VAP under 45% will allow \nBlack voters an opportunity to elect candidates of their choice, \namounting to a Section 2 VRA violation,40 suggesting that “the \nMICRC reevaluate its approach towards compliance with the Voting \nRights Act.”41  \n(c) The Senate Districts have a discriminatory purpose evidenced by their irregular shape \nthat ignore traditional redistricting principles and natural population shifts in favor of a \nracial classification used to artificially manipulate the BVAP of each district:  \ni.  The Senate Districts feature elongated districts and are less compact \nthan districts in the rest of the State and the two previous Senate \nDistrict Maps. \nii.  District 1 is elongated and oddly shaped, wrapping around the \nSouthern and Eastern sides of District 2, with curved projections \nextending from the main body of the district. \niii.  District 2 is oddly shaped, with a myriad of arms or tentacle like \nprojections extending into the surrounding districts.  \n                                                 \n39 MSU Report at p. 109. \n40 Id. \n41 Id. \n43 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-SJB   ECF No. 1,  PageID.44   Filed 03/23/22   Page 44 of 48\n \niv.  District  3  is  elongated  and  oddly  shaped  with  tentacle  like \nprojections extending into the surrounding districts. \nv.  District 4 is elongated and oddly shaped, with a pronounced indent \ninto the district to accommodate oddly shaped District 1.  \nvi.  District 5 is oddly shaped with a jigsaw like boarder with District 6.  \nvii.  District  9  is  oddly  shaped,  looking  like  a  boot  with  a  broad \nprojection on its eastern side. \nviii.  District 11 is oddly shaped, and diagonally splits Macomb County, \nwith a lot of jigsaw like projections.  \nix.  The Senate Districts move large concentrations of Black voters to \ndistricts with a significant higher amount of WVAP, thus diluting \ntheir vote.  \nx.  The Senate Districts are so oddly shaped that the Commission could \nnot have drew them to protect communities of interest.42  \n(d) The Commission’s purpose in enacting the Senate Districts, either in whole or in part, \nwas motivated by race and/or the goal of drawing Senate Districts with specific racial \ncomposition in each district; \ni.  There is not a single BVAP majority-minority district, even though \nat least three could have been drawn. Instead, Plaintiffs were moved \nto districts with lower BVAPs. \n                                                 \n42 MSU Report at p. 108. \n44 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-SJB   ECF No. 1,  PageID.45   Filed 03/23/22   Page 45 of 48\n \nii.  The MSU Report that the Senate Districts were drawn with race as \nthe  primary  motivating  factor.43  Plaintiffs’  forthcoming  Expert \nReport will likewise establish that race was the primary motivating \nfactor.  \niii.  The  MSU  Report  found  it  “striking”  and  “unusual”  that  “no \nmajority-minority district survive[d].”44 \n(e) The shape of the Senate Districts is so irrational that they can only be explained as a \nrace-based gerrymander. \n189.  Because  Plaintiffs  have  established  that  the  Commission  used  race  as  the \npredominant factor in creating the Senate Districts, it is subject to strict scrutiny. Miller, 515 U.S. \nat 916, 115 S.Ct. 2475.  \n190.  The Commission’s use of race in drawing the Senate Districts is not narrowly \ntailored to achieve a compelling governmental interest.  \n191.  The Commission cannot provide adequate justification for its racial discrimination \nagainst Plaintiffs.  \n192.  While remedying past discrimination may serve as a compelling state interest, the \nCommission has not, and cannot, provide strong evidence of such a remedy. See Id. at 922, 115 \nS.Ct. 2475. Mere compliance with federal antidiscrimination laws alone will not alone always \nserve as a compelling governmental interest. Id. at 921, 115 S.Ct. 2475. \n193.  The Commission cannot argue that Section 2 VRA compliance satisfies strict \nscrutiny because the Senate Districts are not in compliance. \n                                                 \n43 MSU Report at 108. \n44 MSU Report at pp. 95-96. \n45 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-SJB   ECF No. 1,  PageID.46   Filed 03/23/22   Page 46 of 48\n \n194.  The Commission’s’ use of race in drawing the Senate Districts is not the least \nrestrictive means available to give Plaintiffs an opportunity to participate equally in the political \nprocess. \n195.  Plaintiffs will provide an illustrative remedy map in the course of these proceedings \nthat will show the Commission had ample ability to draw the Districts with less restrictive means \nthat provide Plaintiffs with an opportunity to participate equally in the political process. \n196.  Plaintiffs have been, and continue to be, denied equal protection under the law and \ninjured by the Commission’s use of race-based discrimination. \n197.  Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law other than the judicial relief sought here. \nImplementation of the redistricted Senate Districts will irreparably harm Plaintiffs’ by violating \ntheir constitutional and statutory rights. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully request this Court: \nA.  Convene a three-judge district court panel to hear and determine Plaintiffs’ claims; \nB.  Declare that the and House and Senate District maps violate Section 2 of the Voting \nRights Act (Counts I – II) and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth \nAmendment to the United States Constitution (Counts III – VI); \nC.

NEFF, J., delivered a separate concurring opinion.  \n \nOPINION AND ORDER \n \nKETHLEDGE, Circuit Judge.  “Under the Equal Protection Clause, districting maps that \nsort voters on the basis of race are by their very nature odious.”  Wisconsin Legislature v. \nWisconsin Elections Commission, 595 U.S. 398, 401 (2022) (per curiam) (internal quotation marks \nomitted).  The plaintiffs here are nineteen African-American Detroiters who live in thirteen \ndifferent Michigan House and Senate districts that each include a portion of Detroit.  They contend \nthat—in Michigan’s 2021 redistricting of its state legislative districts—the boundaries of their \ndistricts were drawn predominantly on the basis of race.  Those district lines were drawn by the \nnewly created Michigan Independent Citizens Redistricting Commission—a body of 13 citizens, \nchosen at random, who came to their task with no experience in redistricting and no knowledge of \nelection law.  But they hired experts to guide them—notably their “voting rights act legal counsel,” \nBruce Adelson, and a political scientist, Dr. Lisa Handley, along with their general counsel, \nJulianne Pastula.   \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 131,  PageID.4705   Filed 12/21/23   Page 2 of\n116\nNo. 1-22-cv-272 \nAgee et al. v. Benson et al. \nLegislative redistricting is usually performed by state legislatures, which usually do not \ncreate a contemporary record of their every move during that process.  But here the Commission \ndid create such a record: every decision they made, every word they spoke, was recorded in real \ntime in a body of transcripts that runs some 10,000 pages.  In that respect the record here is unique \namong  redistricting  cases  litigated  in  federal  court.    That  record  makes  clear  that  the \ncommissioners relied heavily on their experts’ advice, particularly with regard to compliance with \nthe federal Voting Rights Act, 52 U.S.C. § 10301.  And the record shows, overwhelmingly, that \nthose experts—Adelson, especially—expressly told the commissioners, scores if not hundreds of \ntimes, to sort Detroit-area voters into different districts on the basis of race.   \nSpecifically, Adelson and Pastula told the commissioners that, to comply with the Voting \nRights Act (“VRA”), they must limit the “black voting age population”—known as “BVAP” in \nredistricting jargon—to  approximately 35-45%.   That proposition is without support in the \nSupreme Court’s VRA caselaw.   Yet the record further shows that the commissioners did as their \nexperts said—with great difficulty, and misgivings throughout, and over the vociferous objections \nof Detroit residents at the time—so that, in the end, the Commission limited the percentages of \nblack voters, in the districts at issue here, to the racial targets their experts had given them.  And \nso—in a city whose African-American population is almost 80%—the BVAPs of every Detroit-\narea district here, with one exception, fell within 35-45%.  The exception was Senate District 11, \nwhich has a BVAP of 19.19%; but the record shows that most of the African-American voters in \nthat district were put there to lower the BVAP of an adjacent district to the target range.     \nThe record here shows overwhelmingly—indeed, inescapably—that the Commission drew \nthe boundaries of plaintiffs’ districts predominantly on the basis of race.  We hold that those \ndistricts were drawn in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the U.S. Constitution. \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 131,  PageID.4706   Filed 12/21/23   Page 3 of\n116\nNo. 1-22-cv-272 \nAgee et al. v. Benson et al. \nI. \n \nA. \n \n1. \n \nEvery ten years, after a federal census mandated by the Constitution, the states redraw their \nelectoral districts “to account for any changes or shifts in population.”  U.S. Const. art. I, § 2; \nGeorgia v. Ashcroft, 539 U.S. 461, 489 n.2 (2003).  State legislatures usually draw the new district \nlines.  See Rucho v. Common Cause, 139 S. Ct. 2484, 2495 (2019).  Until recently, Michigan was \nno exception.  Following the 2010 decennial census, for instance, the legislature drafted and \nadopted maps for the state senate and house.  In Detroit, where 77.9% of residents are black, these \nmaps included two senate and ten house districts with black-voter populations greater than 50%. \nIn November 2018, however, Michigan voters approved a state constitutional amendment \nthat vested the power to redraw legislative-district lines in an “Independent Citizens Redistricting \nCommission” of citizen laypersons.  Mich. Const. art. IV, § 6.  As amended, the Michigan \nConstitution required the Commission to “abide by the following criteria in proposing and \nadopting” new redistricting plans, “in order of priority:” \n(a) Districts  shall  be  of  equal  population  as  mandated  by  the  United  States \nconstitution, and shall comply with the voting rights act and other federal laws. \n \n(b) Districts shall be geographically contiguous. Island areas are considered to be \ncontiguous by land to the county of which they are a part. \n \n(c) Districts shall reflect the state’s diverse population and communities of interest. \nCommunities of interest may include, but shall not be limited to, populations \nthat  share  cultural  or  historical  characteristics  or  economic  interests. \nCommunities of interest do not include relationships with political parties, \nincumbents, or political candidates. \n \n(d) Districts shall not provide a disproportionate advantage to any political party. \nA disproportionate advantage to a political party shall be determined using \naccepted measures of partisan fairness. \n \n(e) Districts shall not favor or disfavor an incumbent elected official or a candidate. \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 131,  PageID.4707   Filed 12/21/23   Page 4 of\n116\nNo. 1-22-cv-272 \nAgee et al. v. Benson et al. \n \n(f) Districts shall reflect consideration of county, city, and township boundaries. \n \n(g) Districts shall be reasonably compact. \nMich. Const. art. IV, § 6(13).  (We will refer to these criteria as the “Michigan criteria.”) \nIn 2020, Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson formed the new Commission by randomly \nselecting 13 candidates—four Democrats, four Republicans, and five independents—out of a \ngroup of more than 9,000 applicants who had expressed an interest in serving on it.  Redrawing \nlegislative-district lines (i.e., “redistricting”) is complicated business, both legally and factually.  \nSo the Commission began to hire staff, including specialists in mapping software, an executive \ndirector, and a general counsel, Julianne Pastula.  In September 2020, the Commission began \nholding meetings; all of them (save one toward the end of the process) were open to the public—\nand all of them were transcribed.  \n2. \nThe Michigan constitution makes compliance with federal law—including the Voting \nRights Act and the federal constitution—a categorical imperative in Michigan redistricting.  Mich. \nConst. art. IV, § 6(13)(a).  And the federal constitution’s Supremacy Clause, U.S. Const. Art. VI, \ncl. 2, itself would invalidate any district lines drawn in violation of federal law.  See Armstrong v. \nExceptional Child Ctr., Inc., 575 U.S. 320, 324 (2015).  The Commission, for its part, recognized \nearly on that Michigan’s demographics—particularly Detroit’s heavily concentrated African-\nAmerican population—would require close attention to the VRA in the redistricting process.  As \nthe Supreme Court has put it, § 2 of the VRA requires that—when a minority group is large and \ncompact enough to elect its preferred candidates, as black voters obviously are in Detroit—those \nvoters cannot be broken up and “submerged in a larger white voting population” that usually \ndefeats the minority group’s preferred candidates.  Cooper v. Harris, 581 U.S. 285, 301-02 (2017) \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 131,  PageID.4708   Filed 12/21/23   Page 5 of\n116\nNo. 1-22-cv-272 \nAgee et al. v. Benson et al. \n(cleaned up).  Separately, the federal Equal Protection Clause bars a state—absent an extremely \ngood reason—from “separating its citizens into different voting districts on the basis of race.”  \nBethune-Hill v. Virginia State Bd. of Elections, 580 U.S. 178, 187 (2017) (cleaned up).   \nIn February 2021, the Commission held a hearing in which it heard from practitioners of \nfederal election law.  Among them was Leah Aden of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, who \nwarned that partisan justifications might be used to break up majority-black legislative districts: \n[Y]ou’re going to hear people say vote dilution is not happening. This is about \nparty. This is not about race . . . . You’re also going to hear we can’t create this \ngeographically compact minority community. . . . And I want it to be in your head \nthat if minority voters are harmed to achieve partisan power or partisan power is an \nexcuse to harm minority voters, each of those can run afoul of the Constitution and \nthe voting rights act. \n \nMICRC Tr. at 2102. \n \nThe Commission also heard from David Becker, formerly of the Department of Justice’s \nCivil Rights Division.  By way of background, as a practical matter, in “safe” Democratic \ndistricts—like districts in and around Detroit—the dispositive election is the Democratic primary, \nnot the general election; for whoever wins the primary will win the general.  (The same dynamic \nholds, of course, for safe Republican seats.)  Whether black voters in Democratic districts can elect \ntheir preferred candidates, therefore, depends on whether those candidates can win the Democratic \nprimary elections.  Becker therefore urged the Commission as follows: \nAnother thing I really want to stress to you it’s really going to be important to look \nat primary election results.  It’s not just going to be about general elections.  As we \nknow there are places in every state, certainly Michigan, where the outcome of the \nprimary is determinative of the general election. . . . And in those places, you have \nto look at primary elections. \n \nId. at 2106. \n \nLater, the Commission retained Dr. Lisa Handley, an expert in analyzing voting data for \npurposes of compliance with the VRA.  The Commission also retained Bruce Adelson as its \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 131,  PageID.4709   Filed 12/21/23   Page 6 of\n116\nNo. 1-22-cv-272 \nAgee et al. v. Benson et al. \n“voting rights act legal counsel.”  Adelson began practicing law in 1984, worked in the Department \nof Justice from 2000 to 2006, and was counsel to the Arizona redistricting commission in 2011.    \nB. \n \nThe Michigan constitution required the Commission to draft and approve legislative maps \nno later than November 1, 2021.  Mich. Const. art. IV, § 6(7).  But the COVID-19 pandemic \ndelayed the Census Bureau’s release of its 2020 census data; and so the Commission did not begin \nany drafting until August 2021, when that data arrived. \n1. \nThe Commission’s September 2, 2021 meeting.  This meeting set the course for a great deal \nof what followed in the next two months.  During this meeting, Handley and Adelson alike sought \nto advise the Commission about the VRA’s requirements.  Handley addressed the commissioners \nfirst, and went through a power-point presentation in which she said that “redistricting plans cannot \ncrack or pack a geographically concentrated minority community across districts or within a \ndistrict in a manner than dilutes their voting strength.”  See Def.’s Ex. 48 at 3.  Cracking occurs \nwhen a racial group’s members are dispersed “into districts in which they constitute an ineffective \nminority of voters.”  Cooper, 581 U.S. at 292 (cleaned up).  As an example of unlawful “cracking,” \nHandley cited (ironically enough, given what shortly followed) the example of a compact racial \ngroup that had been broken into five districts, in each of which the group’s members constituted \nonly 35% of the district’s voters: \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 131,  PageID.4710   Filed 12/21/23   Page 7 of\n116\nNo. 1-22-cv-272 \nAgee et al. v. Benson et al. \n \nSee Def.’s Ex. 48 at 3.  As an example of unlawful “packing,” Handley offered the example of the \nsame compact racial group—this time packed into a district where it constitutes 100% of voters, \nthereby denying the group potential majorities in two other districts: \n \nId.  Rather than crack or pack districts with large numbers of minority voters, Handley said, the \nCommission should draw districts that “provide minority voters with the opportunity to elect their \ncandidates of choice.”  MICRC Tr. at 5383-84.  To do otherwise—in areas (like Detroit) where \nminority voters had previously succeeded in electing their preferred candidates—would likely \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 131,  PageID.4711   Filed 12/21/23   Page 8 of\n116\nNo. 1-22-cv-272 \nAgee et al. v. Benson et al. \nviolate the VRA.  Id. at 5378-86.  Handley therefore sought to identify the BVAP necessary for \nblack voters to have that “opportunity.”  Id. at 5384. \n  That number in part depended on the percentage of white voters, in particular districts, who \nvote as a “bloc”—meaning they usually prefer white-preferred candidates over black-preferred \nones—as opposed to white voters who “cross over” to support black-preferred candidates.  Id. at \n5379, 5384.  The greater the white-bloc voting, the higher the BVAP necessary for black voters to \nelect their preferred candidates; and the greater the “white crossover” voting, the lower the BVAP \nnecessary to elect black-preferred candidates.   \n  Handley’s role in advising the Commission was to analyze election data and then to \ndetermine, for different districts, what those necessary black-voter percentages might be.  To that \nend, as relevant here, Handley said she had analyzed the election results in two counties—Wayne \n(which includes Detroit) and Oakland—for 14 statewide elections in Michigan since 2012 (e.g., \nthe presidential elections in 2016 and 2020).  (Handley did not analyze any election results for \nMacomb County because black voters are scarce there.)  But only one of Handley’s 14 elections, \nthe 2018 Democratic gubernatorial primary, was a primary election—which, as the DOJ’s David \nBecker had explained, is the election that determines the winning candidate for “safe” seats.  Id. \nat 5381.  And that primary election played no role in Handley’s analysis because black voters had \nnot shown any clear preference in it.  See R.108 at PageID 3287.  Meanwhile, the other 13 elections \nthat Handley analyzed were all general elections—in which voters (black or white) affiliated with \nthe same party usually vote for the same candidate, regardless of what their preferences might have \nbeen in the primary.  MICRC Tr. at 5381-82. \nBased only on that general-election data, however, Handley told the Commission that it \nneed not create majority-black districts in order to comply with the VRA.  Instead—without any \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 131,  PageID.4712   Filed 12/21/23   Page 9 of\n116\nNo. 1-22-cv-272 \nAgee et al. v. Benson et al. \nmention of the differences between primary and general elections in Detroit-area districts—\nHandley said that black voters in Oakland and Wayne counties could consistently elect their \npreferred candidate in districts with BVAPs as low as 35 and 40%:  \nIn Oakland County, 35% is going to work.  40 percent looks like it might work. In \nWayne County where we have a lot more white crossover vote 35% might well \nwork. I’m not advocating that you draw the districts at this amount. I’m advocating \nthat you keep in mind that the districts do not have to be majority-minority in \ncomposition[.] \n \nId. at 5386. \n \nBruce Adelson then addressed the Commission—and he did advocate, then and ever after, \nthat the Commission “draw the districts” at the BVAPs that Handley had specified.  Adelson said \nthat Handley’s analysis would be “very crucial” and “very important” “going forward for the \nCommission[.]”  Id. at 5389.  He added: \nBut  to  the  point  about  packing,  remember  that  the  [sic]  if  a  district  can  be \nestablished through analysis to be able to elect candidates of choice of the minority \ncommunity at, let’s say 40%, if you add on population to that, the courts constitute \nthat as packing. \n \nA commissioner asked, “how do we ensure that we don’t unpack it and then it becomes \ncracked?  And therefore, we are not in compliance in the other direction?  How do we ensure that?”  \nId. at 5390.  Handley responded: \nyou look at the recompiled election results to make sure that the districts you have \ndrawn are effective minority districts.  So those four contests I mentioned earlier as \nbellwether contests [namely, the 2012 U.S. presidential, the 2014 secretary of state, \nthe 2018 gubernatorial, and 2020 U.S. presidential general elections] will be in the \nredistricting package and as you draw . . . you can hit the button that will tell you \nhow those candidates are doing in the proposed district. \n \nId.  The “recompiled election results” to which Handley referred, however, came from the general \nelections she had analyzed.  The “button” for measuring how black-preferred candidates “are doing \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 131,  PageID.4713   Filed 12/21/23   Page 10 of\n116\nNo. 1-22-cv-272 \nAgee et al. v. Benson et al. \nin the proposed districts,” therefore, would measure their success only in general elections, not \nDemocratic primaries.      \n  General Counsel Pastula added that “Dr. Handley’s analysis and her findings and Mr. \nAdelson’s  conclusions  he  is  able  to  draw  from  those  findings  will  certainly  impact  the \n[Commission’s] critical work going forward in redistricting.”  Id. at 5391.  And software consultant \nKim Brace told the Commission about another piece of information that would be available to \nthem throughout the districting process:  “when you draw you will have the racial percentages on \nthe districts as they are being created so you will see what is the racial characteristics of the \nDistrict.”  Id. at 5393. \n2. \n  Map-drawing begins.  About a week later, the Commission began drawing Detroit-area \nsenate districts.  At first, the Commission focused on a variety of the Michigan criteria when \nmapping, including communities of interest (or “COIs”).  For example, Commissioner Rebecca \nSzetela expressed concerns about the “complex demands of COIs” around Hamtramck including \nthe “Latin X community” and the “environmental concerns” common to communities in southwest \nDetroit.  Id. at 5672.  And Commissioner Anthony Eid recommended keeping together several \ncommunities near where he had grown up.  Id. at 5675.  But the Commission was also worried \nabout “packing” black voters—as its experts had recently defined that term—into districts.  On \nSeptember 9, Commissioner MC Rothhorn asked the mapping specialists to pull up the “layer with \nthe dots that allow[] you to see the racial composition of the areas.”  Id. at 5676.  Adelson \nconcurred, since they were then mapping in “one of the counties that Dr. Handley analyzed to say \nthere is racially polarized voting, I think we need to have the dots.”  Id. at 5677.   \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 131,  PageID.4714   Filed 12/21/23   Page 11 of\n116\nNo. 1-22-cv-272 \nAgee et al. v. Benson et al. \n  The Commission soon began to wrestle with the tension between preserving communities \nof interest, on the one hand, and what they understood—again, based on what their experts had \ntold them—as “VRA compliance,” on the other.  On September 13, for example, Rothhorn asked \nthe other commissioners to “watch those numbers [i.e., racial percentages] as we add districts.”  \nId. at 5733.  Eid acknowledged the difficulty of drawing districts in an area with a “very large \nminority population,” and said, “I don’t know a way to get around it unless we start drawing these \ndistricts into the suburbs.”  Id.  Likewise, Commissioner Douglas Clark said that “the only way to \nresolve that is to go into the suburbs but that is not what the people want. . . That is what I heard \nin the two town halls or public hearings we had in Detroit.”  Id.  General Counsel Pastula \nresponded: \nThe districts . . . do not appear to be able to be unpacked unless you go in the \nsuburbs. . . . And while I certainly acknowledge and respect the public comment \nreceived, the Voting Rights Act being the first criteria is going to need to be \nrespected and adhered to.  \n \nId. at 5734.   \n \nLater, Commissioner Szetela echoed this advice.   Clark had emphasized that residents of \nsome Detroit neighborhoods near Grosse Pointe—a wealthy, mostly white city next door—had \nsaid specifically “during the hearings that they don’t want to be associated with Grosse Pointe \nbecause all the money tends to or all the influence tends to flow to Grosse Pointe because they \nhave more money.”  Id. at 5747.  Szetela responded that “I’m trying to balance the Voting Rights \nAct” against those concerns “because [the] Voting Rights Act is our number one” criterion and “I \ndon’t want to have a super concentrated District.”  Id.  When she finished drawing, she told the \nCommission to look “at the percentages of African/Americans in District 8.  It’s just below 50% \nso it’s still a minority majority District based on Dr. Handley’s reporting but it’s not packing people \nin which is exactly what I was trying to accomplish.”  Id. at 5748.   \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 131,  PageID.4715   Filed 12/21/23   Page 12 of\n116\nNo. 1-22-cv-272 \nAgee et al. v. Benson et al. \nLater in the same meeting, Rothhorn told Clark to use the racial-dots tool while mapping \nbecause “this is another VRA area and we may want to be aware of the Black white” population.  \nId. at 5765.  At the end of the day on September 13, the Commission saved a draft senate map \n(Draft Map 162) that included three majority-minority districts.  As relevant here, the districts that \nbecame Senate Districts 1, 3, 6, 8, 10, and 11 had the following BVAPs: \nDistrict    1  3  6  8  10  11 \nNo.  \n  Date  BVAP  BVAP  BVAP  BVAP  BVAP  BVAP \nSenate  9/13/2021  10.98  50.82  76.56  63.77  18.1  7.8 \nMap  Plan \n162 \n \nThat evening, Pastula sent Szetela—who had just been elected Chair of the Commission—\nan email in which she expressed “Significant Concerns” that she and Adelson shared about that \nday’s mapping session.   Specifically, Pastula told Szetela:  \nBruce [Adelson] and I are very concerned and alarmed about the drafting of the \npacked districts that is occurring during today’s mapping session.  While the work \nis preliminary and future steps can be taken to remediate—this will become much \nmore difficult the more packed districts that are drawn.  In addition to not being \nable to justify the numbers coming out of today to a court, these drafts also create \nexpectations on behalf of the public that will also be difficult to address moving \nforward. \n \nPl.’s Ex. 5 at 45.  Pastula added that it would be “critical” for the Commission to use the bellwether-\nelections tool in the “areas where the VRA was implicated,” and that the “Commission is running \nout of time and [has] an enormous amount of work to do.”  Id. \n  The next morning, the mapping specialists installed the “bellwether-elections” tool and \ntaught the Commission how to use it.  See MICRC Tr. at 5803-05.  Adelson then went into a long \nmonologue in which he emphasized the following: \nOne of the things that I would strongly advise and something that we will be talking \na lot about over the next couple of weeks is really study and internalize, Lisa \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 131,  PageID.4716   Filed 12/21/23   Page 13 of\n116\nNo. 1-22-cv-272 \nAgee et al. v. Benson et al. \nHandley’s, Dr. Handley’s PowerPoint. . . . I have read her Power Point virtually \nevery day for the last few weeks. . . .   \n \nPacking means adding or including additional minority voters [beyond] the ones \nneeded to elect what we call candidates of choice. . . .  \n \nSo look at the percentages here [in Handley’s presentation].  Black VAP and \npercent of the vote and you kind of get a sense of [sic] to highlight in a real way \nand again going back to the vitality of Dr. Handley’s PowerPoint how the districts \nare created and how many people from which backgrounds are included. . . .  \n \nAnd what I would suggest in moving forward in the areas where you are now, \ntypically aim for Black populations in the 40-45% range.  It’s a rough estimate. . . . \n[A]nd remember that the aim, the requirement of the law is to avoid packing \nminorities  into  districts  above  and  beyond  the  percentage  at  which  analysis \n[meaning Handley’s analysis] is determined they need to elect candidates of choice.   \n \nId. at 5810-12 (emphasis added). \n  Over the next two days, the Commission tried to “unpack” Detroit’s majority-black \ndistricts.  For example, Commissioner Brittni Kellom—herself a Detroiter—said she was “thinking \nabout utilizing Bruce to look at the Metro Detroit area and kind of unpack.”  Id. at 5825.  Adelson \nresponded that she should “remember Dr. Handley’s analysis” because “there is good general \nwhite cross over support in Wayne County.”  Id. at 5826.  He also said the 36% black-voter \npopulation in a draft district was “close to the line” and “I always like to be cautious and not do it \nexactly 35%, 36% right on the nose.  I like to build in a little bit of a cushion.”  Id.  Clark advised \nKellom to follow a road boundary while drafting, because that would help to “dilute the Black \npopulation.”  Id. at 5842.  Later, as Commissioner Cynthia Orton drafted districts in western \nDetroit, Adelson said that “District 13 is 71% over all minority and 62% Black population.  So I \nwould suggest that all will need to be looked at as well.”  Id. at 5871.  Chair Szetela suggested \ndrawing in Detroit narrowly, “like a spoke coming out” from downtown, so that the Commission \ncould “balance” and “get rid of the highly concentrated [African-American] districts.”  Id. at 5872. \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 131,  PageID.4717   Filed 12/21/23   Page 14 of\n116\nNo. 1-22-cv-272 \nAgee et al. v. Benson et al. \nOn September 15, Rothhorn imitated the “spoke” concept and explained that he was trying \nto “decrease the minority percentage [] to have a more balanced Black-white ratio.”  Id. at 5896-\n5902.  The Commission also began to employ the bellwether-elections tool to see whether black-\npreferred candidates would prevail in the draft districts—which they always did, because the tool \nmeasured the success of Democratic candidates in general elections for Democratic safe seats.  \nSee, e.g., id. at 5876. \n  Yet some commissioners expressed concern with the way they were drawing maps.  \nCommissioner Juanita Curry—who was herself from Detroit—said, “I’m just a little off on \nkeeping some places whole and some places not . . . . For instance like Detroit we split it up some.”  \nSzetela responded that Adelson had directed the Commission to split up the city to comply with \nthe VRA:   \n[W]e specifically split up Detroit because our expert, Bruce Adelson had—was \nuncomfortable with the districts we originally came up with because they were \nhighly concentrated African/American communities to the point where he said that \nit would likely violate the [VRA].  And so he had indicated that we should try to \nget those percentages down to maybe 40% African/American population.   \n \nId. at 5937. \n  By September 15, the Commission had completed its first full senate map (Draft Map 165) \nwhich reduced the number of black-majority districts in Detroit from three to two: \nDistrict    1  3  6  8  10  11 \nNo.  \n  Date  BVAP  BVAP  BVAP  BVAP  BVAP  BVAP \nSenate  9/13/2021  10.98  50.82  76.56  63.77  18.1  7.8 \nMap Plan \n162 \nSenate  9/15/2021  34.86  44.87  51.99  59.06  49.38  11.02 \nMap Plan \n165 \n \n3. \n \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 131,  PageID.4718   Filed 12/21/23   Page 15 of\n116\nNo. 1-22-cv-272 \nAgee et al. v. Benson et al. \n  Mapping continues. Beginning five days later, from September 20 to 28, the Commission \ndrafted its initial Detroit-area house map.  Adelson reiterated at the outset that “[a]ny district that \nhas majority-minority VAP I think you should aim to let’s see what we can do to kind of potentially \nunpack that based on Dr. Handley’s analysis. . . . Because just as Dr. Handley said if you can elect \n[at] 35%, 40% then why would you add 40, 50% minority population?”  Id. at 6204.  Yet the \nCommission struggled to do what Adelson said.  Commissioner Eid, for instance, said, “So I’m \njust trying to think about how we are going to do this because I mean the population density [of] \nAfrican/Americans is so high in Detroit it’s probably going to cause a problem with packing unless \nwe have some districts that people may view as oddly shaped[.]”  Id. at 6205.  Szetela agreed:  “I \ndon[’t] really know what to do because the Senate districts you saw we sort of stretched them out \nand I don’t know how to do it with House Districts and I don’t know how we can avoid having \nhouse [districts] that are going to be like 75, 85% African/American[.]”  Id. at 6205-06. \n  Rothhorn—who had just been elected Vice Chair—then began mapping the area that \nbecame House District 1 in southwest Detroit.  At first he drew boundaries based on communities \nof interest, such as “Greektown” and the “Latin X community[.]” Id. at 6210-12.  But Rothhorn \nchecked the draft district’s racial percentages continually as he drew.  Id. at 6213.  Then Szetela \ndrew what became House District 2—which had a “Bengali community” that she did not “want to \nsplit[.]”  Id. at 6219.  But that made the district’s BVAP too high:  “now the problem is it’s 77% \nAfrican/American.  I think that’s where the challenge is.  So is there anything I can do about that?”  \nId. at 6219.  Adelson responded, “I think that [] in exploring the other areas around this District \nand downtown and greater Detroit there may be other populations that either you could include, \nyou could take some of two and add them to other parts of the City.”  Id. at 6219.  Rothhorn echoed \nAdelson, telling Szetela “that Hamtramck could be another spoke heading north” and that this \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 131,  PageID.4719   Filed 12/21/23   Page 16 of\n116\nNo. 1-22-cv-272 \nAgee et al. v. Benson et al. \n“will dilute the Black population.  I shouldn’t say dilute right.  It would be more balanced.”  Id. at \n6220. \nSzetela took that advice, and found that “making that change makes a difference.  It brings \n[it] down [] to 54% African/American from where it was.”  Id. at 6220.  Adelson approved, saying \nthe Commission had done: \na substantial job with [the] percentage of the Black population.  It kind of shows \nyou that there are ways to approach it.  Wherever you find the population east, west \nor north because I mean you brought it down, I think almost 25% without doing too \nmany adjustments.  So I think that you’ll find other ways going forward so that [] \nwith this concept of whether it’s going north or whatever direction I think you will \nbe able to find population to balance the District.  \n \nId. at 6221.  Rothhorn noted the map’s new configuration:  “Detroit has spokes.”  Id. at 6222.  \nSzetela finished drawing the district and explained that she tried to “draw a District that is \ncompliant with the Voting Rights Act by not packing the African/American community.”  Id. at \n6223. \nThe Commission thereafter repeatedly used the racial-dots tool to identify high-density \nAfrican-American communities and then to dilute them using the spoke method.  For example, \nSzetela and Clark collaborated to draw what became House District 10.  Clark feared that “[w]e \nare going to end up with an African/American population that is going to be pretty significant.”  \nId. at 6410.  Szetela recommended “grabbing population” from “the Grosse Pointes[.]”  Id. at 6411.  \nClark countered, “that eastern part of Detroit specifically said they don’t want to be part of Grosse \nPointe.”  Id.  But Szetela said “we have to remember that VRA is first on our list.  And so we have \nto look at accommodating VRA first.  And if that requires Grosse Pointe to do it, I think that is \nwhere we need to look first.”  Id.  The Commission then added several Gross Pointe communities \nto the map, with Adelson assuring them that “the west of Grosse Pointe park does elect [minority] \ncandidates of choice[.]”  Id. at 6411-16.  But Adelson later said that the BVAP in an adjacent \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 131,  PageID.4720   Filed 12/21/23   Page 17 of\n116\nNo. 1-22-cv-272 \nAgee et al. v. Benson et al. \ndistrict—what  became  House  District  11—was  still  too  high,  and  that  having  a  “minority \npopulation that is so in excess of [Dr. Handley’s] opportunity to elect percentage would be difficult \nto justify.”  Id. at 6420, 6426, 6433.  Clark adjusted the district lines and explained that “what I’m \ntrying to do is reduce the Black population.”  Id. at 6434.  \nAdelson frequently used the bellwether-elections tool to check the Commission’s draft \ndistricts for “VRA compliance.”  See, e.g., 6454-56, 6467-68, 6474.  Vice Chair Rothhorn, for \ninstance, finished drawing what became House District 15 and said that he had been “mostly \nconcerned about vote dilution.”  Id. at 6440.  Adelson then used the bellwether-elections tool and \nreported that, in the district, “across the board the candidates of choice win.”  Id. at 6441.  \n  Later, Orton drafted what became House Districts 12 and 13.  She initially focused on \nDistrict 12 and tried to keep certain neighborhoods together, such as Eastpointe and Detroit.  Id. \nat 6476.  But soon she asked the mapping specialist:  “Can we also put on the African/American \ntheme,” i.e., the racial-dots tool.  Id.  Then Orton said, “I don’t think we are going to be able to get \nup into lower[-percentage] minority areas.  So that might be a problem.  So it looks to me like in \norder to try to balance it more racially, we would have to split this into two [districts] and do two \nspokes up.”  Id.  Commissioner Kellom agreed with that approach.  Id.  Orton then continued \ndrafting.  In what became District 12, she retained a precinct because it added “a little more white \npopulation in to balance it.”  Id. at 6479.  Adelson again used the bellwether-elections tool to \nconfirm that the district elected African-American candidates of choice “across the board.”  Id. at \n6481.   \nRothhorn summarized the Commission’s work—in what became House Districts 12, 13, \nand 14—as “trying to peel off pieces or create spokes, chutes and ladders to create a, yeah, a more \nracially balanced District.”  Id. at 6515.  Adelson said the Commission was trying “not to pack \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 131,  PageID.4721   Filed 12/21/23   Page 18 of\n116\nNo. 1-22-cv-272 \nAgee et al. v. Benson et al. \nvoters of color, Black voters beyond the point at which they can elect candidates of choice,” but \nurged the Commission to “please be aware of the terminology” it used to describe its work.  Id. at \n6515-16.   \nAs mapping continued, some commissioners became concerned with how the Commission \nwas breaking up communities of interest to create racially balanced districts.  For example, \nRothhorn said, “We are being challenged here in our House District and you know with sincere \napologies to breaking up a COI but I think we had to do that with Grosse Pointes like we are going \nto have to make hard choices.”  Id. at 6573.  Orton added, “I’m really uncomfortable with all the \ncommunities of interest we are cutting up.”  Id.  Adelson acknowledged those concerns, but said \n“if you look at those districts that were created, I mean there were some hard choices that were \nmade.  And acute awareness of what the imperatives were but you created some districts that right \nnow seem pretty strong. As far as Voting Rights Act issues and maintaining the ability to elect.”  \nId. at 6575.  Orton remained concerned:  “So my feeling is I’m uncomfortable with the amount of \ncommunities and communities of interest that were are splitting up [] from a Voting Rights Act \nperspective.”  Id. at 6619.  Adelson responded at length: \nYou know, just this discussion the last couple minutes really shows you know kind \nof being on the knife’s edge in the sense of that I understand is very clear that you’re \nweighing, competing considerations.  And I think that the issues about communities \nof interest and keeping sort of communities together are I’ve read a lot of public \ncomments in general and I understand that that is a significant consideration. . . But \nI think it is very important from a compliance standpoint to look at the ranked \ncriteria and the number one criteria is the U.S. Constitution and Federal law. \n \nId. at 6618-19.   \n  On September 23, Commissioner Steven Lett drafted what became House District 26, west \nof downtown Detroit.  He asked for the racial-dots “thematic,” drew the district boundaries, and \nended with a black-voter population of 34.5%.  Id. at 6724, 6726.  Rothhorn said that percentage \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 131,  PageID.4722   Filed 12/21/23   Page 19 of\n116\nNo. 1-22-cv-272 \nAgee et al. v. Benson et al. \nwas “a little bit low,” but Lett responded that Handley’s report had said districts with those \npercentages “elected a candidate of choice.”  Id. at 6727.  Adelson interjected that in “Wayne \nCounty, the percentage of the vote where a Black candidate would win at 35% VAP. Yes. Wayne \nCounty performs in that respect . . . . So I think to your point, yes, according to Dr. Handley’s \nanalysis that in Wayne County, Wayne County can elect candidates of choice at 35% VAP.”  Id. \nat 6727.   \n  Then came a dissonant note, as Adelson conceded the importance of data from party \nprimaries.  He said: \noften in areas where there is a propensity to elect minority candidates of choice, the \nelections are often decided in the primary.  Rather than the general.  So having \nprimary results to not compare with but to supplement general results is really \nimportant.  In my experience it’s certainly something I’ve always been able to look \nat.  We had a lot of primary results in Arizona for example.  So I think that it is \nimportant to have.  \n \nId. at 6729.  Orton asked, “will we get that information?”  Id.  But the discussion meandered \nelsewhere and she did not get an answer. \nThat same day—September 23—General Counsel Pastula reminded the Commission that \n“partisan fairness” was another criterion to consider.  She explained, though, that “partisan fairness \nis measured on a statewide plan.”  Id. at 6712.  That meant the Commission could measure partisan \nfairness only when it finished a statewide plan, rather than as it went along.  Nor did the \nCommission yet have a software tool to evaluate partisan fairness.  See R.112 at PageID 3675.   \nIn that same meeting, Pastula gave the Commission some more specific BVAP numbers \nthat it should strive to meet:  “for Saginaw County looking at notes I have 40% to 45, Genesee was \n35-40%. Saginaw is 40% so I wanted to make sure that I updated that from my prior statement.  \nAnd Oakland County I wrote 42-43% just to be different there but for Saginaw County 40% would \nbe the appropriate measure.”  MICRC Tr. at 6768.  Orton said that recently she “could not get to \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 131,  PageID.4723   Filed 12/21/23   Page 20 of\n116\nNo. 1-22-cv-272 \nAgee et al. v. Benson et al. \nthat threshold of the 35-40% or maybe it was 40% in that County”; Pastula responded that she \n“would encourage the Commission to do their best efforts at this time.”  Id. \nFor the next several days, the Commission almost exclusively mapped outside of Detroit.  \nOn September 28, the Commission completed its draft house map and saved it as Draft Map 183.  \nAs relevant here, the districts that became House Districts 1, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, and 14 had the \nfollowing BVAPs: \nDistrict    1  7  8  10  11  12  14 \nNo.  \n  Date  BVAP   BVAP   BVAP  BVAP  BVAP  BVAP  BVAP \nHouse  9/28/2021  28.62  79.04  54.09  42.74  65.66  43.74  38.33 \nMap \nPlan 183 \n \n4. \n  September 29 to 30:  Revisions to House map.  The Commission then revised its initial \nmaps with the aim of what Pastula called “compliance analysis.”  Id. at 7168.  The Commission \nbegan with areas outside of Detroit, and discussed making changes based on the Michigan criteria \nof “communities of interest,” “partisan fairness,” and not favoring incumbents.  Id. at 7162-63.  \nAdelson then interjected:  “I also wanted to make the point that as you recall . . . I believe these \nwere the State House districts in the Wayne County area.  That several of them are . . . have the \nappearance of being packed.  And that is something that must be addressed.  That is one of the \nchanges I envision.”  He added, “I don’t have a list of things . . . [an] inclusive list [that] must be \naddressed.  But the [p]acked districts are [an] absolute.”  Id. at 7164.   \nThe discussion then returned to mapping outside of Detroit, to different ways of measuring \npartisan fairness, and to Dr. Handley’s upcoming visit to the Commission—her first since the \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 131,  PageID.4724   Filed 12/21/23   Page 21 of\n116\nNo. 1-22-cv-272 \nAgee et al. v. Benson et al. \noutset of its map-drawing—to give a presentation on partisan fairness.  But Adelson again steered \nthe Commission back to “packing” and the VRA:   \nyour legal team agrees that Friday is significant in that Dr. Handley will hopefully \nbe able to present partisan fairness.  But it is important and I’m sorry I’m going to \nspeak for you.  I will speak in one voice that the legal team strongly believes there \nare issues in addition of course to the partisan fairness.  There are many voting \nrights issues and just in talking about the packed districts in Wayne County . . . So \nthere are other considerations.  Certainly we agree with the partisan fairness and \nthat is significant.  But there are other issues.   \n \nId. at 7167. \nAt this point, the Commission began to revise house districts in the Detroit area, which \nSzetela called “bacon strip districts,” based on their shapes extending to the northern suburbs.  Id. \nat 7194.  She then made changes to draft House Districts 14, 15, and 17—west of downtown \nDetroit—and noted that she had lowered those districts’ BVAPs:  “So you can see that [District \n14] dropped from 74% African American to 61 . . . And then 15 dropped from 62.7 to 50.2.  And \n17 dropped from 69.29 to 56.4.”  Id. at 7198.  Adelson responded that the “percentages are still \nhigher than Dr. Handley’s analysis but I think that is a good start to adjusting and to be more in \nline with her racially polarized voting analysis and the ability to elect.  So while . . . the Black \npopulation is still higher than her analysis determined it is still significantly improved from what \nit had been previously.”  Id.  Rothhorn asked, “Do we need to look at the election results?”  Id. at \n7199.  Adelson responded, “as far as the election results, as I recall these districts all proved out \npretty well.  I think that I would recommend focusing on percentages and comparing them to Dr. \nHandley’s [BVAP] percentages for Wayne County which as I recall is 35-40%[.]”  Id.  He added \nthat  the  Wayne  County  districts  required  “additional  tinkering”  which  “is  going  to  impact \ncommenters’ preferences on keeping communities whole.”  Id.  “But,” he reminded them, “the \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 131,  PageID.4725   Filed 12/21/23   Page 22 of\n116\nNo. 1-22-cv-272 \nAgee et al. v. Benson et al. \nVoting Rights Act is the number one criterion together with the one person one vote in the U.S. \nConstitution.”  Id.   \nThe Commission followed Adelson’s guidance, concluding that the only way to reach the \nBVAPs in Handley’s report was to continue to stretch districts into predominately white suburbs.  \nId. at 7199-7200.  For several Wayne County house districts Rothhorn suggested changes that \nwould “better comply with [the] VRA bringing down the Black voting age population to a range \nthat is closer to 40%.”  Id. at 7201.  Adelson approved, saying the Commission was “figuring out \nthe percentages [corresponding] with Dr. Handley’s analysis.”  Id. at 7202.   \nAgain, however, some commissioners raised concerns about the lengths they had gone \ntoward that end.  For example, Commissioner Dustin Witjes asked, “Looking at the districts we \nhave, how much thinner can they get and how much further can they exten[d] out before they are \none precinct or one actual voting precinct wide?”  Id. at 7219.  Commissioner Orton then expressed \nthat she thought the house map was already “VRA compliant” in Detroit and that they should “pay \nattention to communities of interest” going forward.  Id. at 7222.  Commissioner Janice Vallette \nagreed.  Id. at 7222-23.  But Adelson said that the district that became House District 11 had a \n“64% non-Hispanic Black voting age population” and that the BVAP for what became House \nDistrict 7 was “almost 77% non-Hispanic Black voting age population . . . these numbers are well \nin [ex]cess of what Dr. Handley analyzed.  And in [ex]cess of what I’ve advised the Commission.”  \nId. at 7223.  Pastula agreed and “strongly encourage[d]” the Commission to “start fixing them.”  \nId. at 7224. \nBut  Commissioner  Rhonda  Lange  was  still  focused  on  communities  of  interest.  \nSpecifically, she said, “I understand VRA []comes above other criteria but we have a criteria of \ncommunity of interest so if we receive input of community of interest that says they absolutely do \n22 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 131,  PageID.4726   Filed 12/21/23   Page 23 of\n116\nNo. 1-22-cv-272 \nAgee et al. v. Benson et al. \nnot want to be split and that drives up the African/American population, then is there leeway in \nthat VRA because we are accommodating for a community of interest which is also part of our \nstate Constitution?”  Id. at 7225.  Adelson responded:  \nyour  question  goes  right  to  the  core  of  one  aspect  of  redistricting  there  are \ncompeting values and there will be people who may be satisfied or not satisfied.  \nBut the bottom line is that if keeping communities of interest, not splitting them, \nhaving them implicates the packing of minority voters, the dilution of minority \nvoters then the number one criteria is the Federal criteria . . . . the bottom line is the \nFederal criteria are the absolute priority.  And there may be communities of interest \nthat are not able to be included in certain districts because they implicate Voting \nRights Act problems. \n \nId. at 7225.   \nPastula then recommended that the Commission identify any district “that is higher than \n40% for the Black voting age population[,]” so that “those quote unquote fixes can be dealt with \nand then this map can be ready for the partisan fairness analysis. . . . I would recommend that \nanything with higher than 40% Black voting age population be looked at.”  Id. at 7226-27.  Szetela \nsaid, “I think what she is suggesting [is] we just go down the districts one by one and anything that \nis over 40% look if we can rebalance it.”  Id. at 7228.  Orton said, “this is a densely populated \nminority population City so does that mean anything above 40% is not VRA compliant?”  Id. at \n7229.  Szetela said, “Commissioner Lange, that is my understanding of what we are looking for is \nwe are trying to bring things down to 35-40%[.]”  Id.  Pastula then referenced Dr. Handley’s report \nand again offered concrete guidance:  “the range for Detroit was 35-40%, Oakland County was \nabove  40%.    So  it’s  based  on  the  area  you  were  in,  that  is  why,  that’s  why  \n. . . I flagged the 40%.”  Id. at 7230.  She recommended that the Commission could “just make a \nlist and then go back and start fixing them.”  Id. \nThe Commission then resumed mapping.  It started by revising what later became House \nDistricts 7 and 11 because they had the “highest” black-voter percentages at 76% and 64%, \n23 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 131,  PageID.4727   Filed 12/21/23   Page 24 of\n116\nNo. 1-22-cv-272 \nAgee et al. v. Benson et al. \nrespectively.   Id. at 7232.  Commissioner Curry first revised  what became District 7,  and \nacknowledged that she needed to “reduce” the black-voter population there to “40, 45” percent.  \nId. at 7234.  Curry made adjustments that “took out a lot of African/American population.”  Id. at \n7235.  Yet the BVAPs remained high, so Curry determined that the “only way to go is up north” \nto reduce them.  Id. at 7239.  She did so and reduced the BVAP for that district from “over 75% \nto about 60%.”  Id. at 7240.  Commissioner Eid said that result was “not perfect but headed in the \nright direction.”  Id. \nEid then revised what became House District 11, adding predominately white suburban \nareas, including Grosse Pointe Woods—which reduced the district’s BVAP from 64% to 53%.  Id. \nat 7241.  But several commissioners again complained that they had disregarded what the public \nhad said about preserving communities of interest in that area.  Id. at 7241-42.  Commission Orton, \nfor instance, said “I still think we should try and keep the communities of interest together . . . . I \nhate to split them up.”  Id. at 7242.  Eid responded, “I agree with you.  And I hate to split them up \nbut I think for this house map I don’t see another way to do it because that is where the white \npopulation is around Detroit . . . . we need to get [the map] to be compliant.”  Id.  Commissioner \nClark echoed Orton’s critique saying, “that Section of Detroit at the public hearings [said] they did \nnot want to be connected with Grosse Pointe.”  Id.  But General Counsel Pastula responded that \nthey should continue to strive to reach their “goal” of reducing the districts’ BVAPs to the \npercentages listed Handley’s analysis.  Id. at 7243.  Eid responded that “I will just continue to \nfinish fixing this.”  Id. \nAround this time, Adelson and Pastula had sidebar conversations with Chair Szetela and \nVice Chair Rothhorn.  According to Szetela, “the hammer came down on the Commission” and \nAdelson and Pastula said the Commission needed to “stop thinking about communities of interest, \n24 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 131,  PageID.4728   Filed 12/21/23   Page 25 of\n116\nNo. 1-22-cv-272 \nAgee et al. v. Benson et al. \nto stop thinking about keeping municipal boundaries together” and instead “solely focus on race \nbecause we needed to bring these districts down.”  R.112 at PageID 3662-63.   \nAccordingly, Szetela then developed an alternative map that brought “percentages down \nin most districts below 40%.”  MICRC Tr. at 7270-71.  She presented this map to the Commission \nand said she “did what Mr. Adelson asked and tried to lower the numbers,” but acknowledged that, \nto do so, she had created “some crazy sho[e] string districts.”  Id. at 7271.   \nThe Commission thereafter continued working on what became House Districts 10 and 11.  \nSome commissioners observed that the districts had not yet reached the “35-40%” goal for Wayne \nCounty.  Id. at 7277.  Adelson responded that the changes were an “improvement” and that the \nCommission was “moving in the right direction” but was not “finished.”  Id.  He encouraged the \nCommission to continue its “systematic approach” of “going down the list literally of the districts \nand looking at the voting age population.”  Id. at 7279. \nLater, Commissioner Kellom revised what became House District 8, reducing its black-\nvoter percentage to 56.  Id. at 7279-80.  Adelson encouraged her:  “Well look at what you’ve done \nin just a few minutes.  You are diversifying the district and addressing [] the compliance concerns.”  \nId.  He then told the Commission to “keep to that systematic approach.”  Id. at 7281.  But some \ncommissioners sought further guidance.  Commissioner Eid, for instance, asked, “What is the \nhighest percentage [a district] can be to fend off legal challenges in the future?”  Id. at 7283.  \nAdelson, referring to what became House District 8, said “there is no like absolute magic bullet  \n. . . but 53.85% yes, it’s an improvement.”  He added, “my feeling is that there is more to be done \nhere.  Because I am [loth] to just say creating 54, 55, 56% majority minority districts in an area \nthat analysis is determined, Black voters can elect at percentages lower.  I’m not prepared to do \nthat.”  Id. at 7283.  \n25 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 131,  PageID.4729   Filed 12/21/23   Page 26 of\n116\nNo. 1-22-cv-272 \nAgee et al. v. Benson et al. \nThe Commission then reduced the black-voter population in several districts by connecting \ndowntown African-American communities with still more suburban ones.  That led Szetela to tell \nthe Commission that “I think we can accomplish what Mr. Adelson is suggesting we do.  It’s just \ngoing to require a little creativity.”  Id. at 7343-44.  Later, Commissioner Clark commented on the \ndevelopment of the map:  “we took those spokes and went so far north and so far west. . . . But it’s \na tradeoff.  I mean we have to get compliant so we have to do something and we made the decision \nto go the route with the spokes.”  Id. at 7348.  By the end of the day on September 30, the \nCommission had produced Draft Map 193. \nDistrict    1  7  8  10  11  12  14 \nNo.  \n  Date  BVAP  BVAP  BVAP  BVAP  BVAP  BVAP  BVAP \nHouse  9/28/2021  28.62  79.04  54.09  42.74  65.66  43.74  38.33 \nMap \nPlan 183 \nHouse  9/30/2021  36.58  66.54  50.37  58.44  49.23  43.74  39.21 \nMap \nPlan 193 \n \nThe next day, the Commission paused mapping while Dr. Handley gave a presentation on \npartisan fairness.  She provided several metrics to measure partisan fairness and presented “some \npolitical fairness scores for some of the plans” the Commission had already drawn.  Id. at 7375.  \nHandley said she was “surprised and pleased” to see that their efforts “to adjust the VRA numbers” \nwere “producing better measures” for partisan fairness.  Id. at 7410.  She also explained that the \nmapping specialists were developing a partisan-fairness tool that “was almost ready” and which \nwould allow it to “run political fairness reports whenever you have a plan that you want to run it \non.”  Id. at 7375.  \nDr. Handley also reiterated Pastula’s point that this analysis “can only be done off of a \ncomplete plan.”  Id. at 7380.  And Handley, Adelson, and Szetela reminded the Commission that \n26 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 131,  PageID.4730   Filed 12/21/23   Page 27 of\n116\nNo. 1-22-cv-272 \nAgee et al. v. Benson et al. \nthe state constitution elevated other criteria, including “compliance” with the Voting Rights Act, \nover partisan fairness.  Id. at 7382, 7386-87.  \n5. \n  October  4:    Revisions  to  Senate  map.    On  October  4,  the  Commission  began  its \n“compliance analysis” of the senate map.  At first some commissioners were confused, thinking \nthey had already drawn a VRA-“compliant” senate map.  Adelson was absent at this time, but \nGeneral Counsel Pastula said that Adelson “didn’t sign off” on the senate plan and that it would \nbe “an excellent use of time” to “get those Metro Detroit districts closer to the 30 to 40% [BVAP] \nrange.”  Id. at 7436, 7440.  She reiterated her earlier guidance: \nI wanted to also address again the narrative that 50% minority is the—that is not \nthe courts have not supported that wholesale adoption of 50% or 51%.  What Dr. \nHandley’s racial bloc voting analysis has given the Commission is the benchmarks \nand the guide rails for each of the Counties that need to be adjusted.  [In] Wayne \nCounty [it] is 35-40%.  Genessee is 35-40.  Saginaw is 40-45%. And Oakland \nCounty is 42, 43%. Again that would provide the opportunity to elect.  So you don’t \nneed districts with 60% minority voting age population in any of those four \nCounties to achieve compliance. \n \nId. at 7440.  Pastula referred to these percentages as “the goals identified [] by your racial bloc \nvoting analysis. And the interpretation by your Voting Rights Act counsel,” meaning Adelson.  Id. \nat 7441.  Clark expressed frustration with this goal, responding: “Now [I] know they want it lower \nbut sometimes you just can’t do that because of the distribution of the people.”  Id. at 7439.  \nRothhorn replied:  “I think what we can interpret from [our legal counsel’s] advice is if we don’t \ntry to get to 35%, we have not done our due diligence and therefore we may be exposing ourselves \nto a legal risk we might be able to defend ourselves against but can’t guarant[ee] that.”  Id. \n  The Commission duly started to revise its senate map.  Commissioner Vallette worked on \nwhat became Senate District 10, employing the spoke technique to stretch the district “back up \nnorth” to reduce its black-voter population.  Id. at 7441-42.  Rothhorn approved:  “Looks like [the \n27 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 131,  PageID.4731   Filed 12/21/23   Page 28 of\n116\nNo. 1-22-cv-272 \nAgee et al. v. Benson et al. \ndistrict] has reduced from 47.3 to 45.8 so you are definitely heading in the right direction, Janice.”  \nId. at 7442.  Rothhorn also asked Vallette to consider communities of interest as she drew the \ndistrict.  Id. at 7444.  But Witjes interjected:  “Don’t worry” about the “community of interest \n. . . That should [] not [be] something we’re looking at.  We should be going into looking at just \ncomplying with the Voting Rights Act.”  Id.  Commissioner Vallette soon finished working on the \ndistrict, and Szetela said:  “Brought your African/American [population] below 40%.  So now you \nare perfectly in the sweet spot of 35-40.”  Id. at 7446. \n  Next, Commissioner Richard Weiss adjusted what became Senate District 3.  Rothhorn \nsaid  “we are currently at 43.25 so you want to try to get it to 35-40” BVAP, and reminded him \nthat “we are not focusing on COI.”  Id. at 7446-47.  Szetela also suggested that Weiss try and find \n“more white populations” and that his “best bet is going to look up along the border into Oakland \nCounty.”  Id. at 7447.  Weiss did so; as he reached into Oakland County, Commissioner Lett \ninterjected, “What’s the target for Macomb? Oakland[.]”  Rothhorn responded, “Oakland County \nthe target is 42 to 43ish.”  Id. at 7449.  Weiss reduced the black-voter population, finished drafting, \nand again Szetela said, “you are in the sweet spot at this point.”  Id. at 7450. \nCommissioner Witjes then revised what became Senate Districts 6 and 8.  Id.  As with the \nother districts, he sought to dilute the black-voter population in each by “going north.”  Id.  In what \nbecame District 8, for instance, he drew the district north to include the entire the city of \nBirmingham—one of the wealthiest communities in Michigan, where the median household \nincome is $151,556—thereby uniting it with portions of Detroit, where the median household \nincome  is  $37,761.    Birmingham  city,  Michigan,  U.S.  Census  Bureau, \nhttps://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/birminghamcitymichigan/PST045222  (last  visited \nDec.  21,  2023);  Detroit  city,  Michigan,  U.S.  Census  Bureau, \n28 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 131,  PageID.4732   Filed 12/21/23   Page 29 of\n116\nNo. 1-22-cv-272 \nAgee et al. v. Benson et al. \nhttps://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/detroitcitymichigan,MI/PST045222  (last  visited \nDec. 21, 2023). \nCommissioner Clark was alarmed, saying, “When  you go into Birmingham, we are \nstretching this thing all the way from mid-Detroit all the way up there.”  Id. at 7451.  Szetela \nreplied, “What other way is [there] to get VRA [compliance]?”  Id.  Rothhorn observed:  “Started \n[at] 57.32 now we are 44.13 nice work.”  Id. at 7453.  Witjes asked, “What does it need to go down \nto?”  Id.  Szetela answered, “Wayne is 40 ideally.  35-40%.”  Id.  Witjes then reduced what became \nDistrict 8’s black-voter population to 41.77%, and began working on what became District 6.  Id. \nat 7455.  Szetela said he should “balance” the district by going north:  “you’re going to bring it \ninto Farmington and that will reduce your African/American population.”  Id.  Witjes managed to \nreduce the district’s black-voter population to 40.7%.  Id. at 7464.  He explained:  the “rationale \nfor these adjustment[s] this is taking into account the Voting Rights Act and looking at the voting \nage population and the Black voting age population to make them so that they . . . so the districts \nare able to elect candidates of choice.”  Id. \nAt this point, as before, some commissioners aired concerns.  Eid said, “I don’t like \nsplitting up Canton and I don’t like splitting up Farmington . . . . if we have to split both of them, \nwe have to split it but I would rather them be whole.”  Id. at 7468.  Curry added that what became \nSenate District 1 looked “crazy” and “terrible,” and said, “I mean it just looks like somebody just \nsaid well we don’t care about Detroit.”  Id. at 7469.  Rothhorn responded, “I think the reason it’s \ndrawn if my understanding is correct Commissioner Curry it’s related to the VRA.  Right where \nthe white and Black populations are balanced.”  Curry retorted, “It may be balanced but it looks \ntoo crazy.”  Id.  Sarah Reinhardt, attending on behalf of the Michigan Secretary of State’s office, \n29 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 131,  PageID.4733   Filed 12/21/23   Page 30 of\n116\nNo. 1-22-cv-272 \nAgee et al. v. Benson et al. \nthen reminded the Commission that compactness was the state constitution’s “lowest ranked \ncriteri[on].”  Id.  at 7470.   \nThe Commission thereafter revised what became Senate Districts 5, 6, and 13.  Id. at 7470.  \nBecause the districts bordered one another, the black-voter population fluctuated as commissioners \nmade changes.  See e.g., id. at 7470-76.  Ultimately, though, the Commission continued to lower \nthe percentages towards the goals provided by Adelson and Pastula.  As this process went on, \nCommissioner Curry continued to express concern about splitting up communities of interest.  But \nRothhorn responded that, “the reason I think we are trying to split it is we are trying to get the \nnumbers that we were given from Dr. Handley at 35% with the Black voting age population that \nis 35%[.]”  Id. at 7480.  Adelson agreed, saying “as you know it’s very important if not essential \nthat Dr. Handley’s analysis be followed for compliance.”  Id. at 7481.  He added, “the Supreme \nCourt has made it very clear that if you pack voters, if voters are put in a District in [ex]cess of \nwhat racial bloc voting analysis shows, that’s an issue.  And I know we have talked about that.  \nAnd we are going to continue to adhere to it.”  Id. \nAdelson later said the Commission should not try to adhere to single number of “35%, \n45%”; instead, he said, “having a range, 35-40%, 40-45%, yeah, I think that’s more advisable.”  \nId. at 7482.  Eid then responded with his own doubts about the premises of Handley’s analysis:   \nI’m becoming increasingly uncomfortable with this direction that we’re going \nunder.  Because while it is unpacking the districts you know we don’t have any \nDistrict that is close to 90%, 70% or even 60%.  But you know the numbers that we \nare hitting it just makes me question how is that going to work with actually electing \na  candidate  of  choice.    And  I  think  part  of  the  problem  I  have  with  this \nunderstanding is the analysis did not include primary election results.  So like if we \nlook at District 17 here.  We have it at 35.14% Black voting age population.  If you \nhave a primary election where there is two Black candidates and a white candidate \nhow is it that you know the candidate of choice is actually going to get elected? I \nunderstand that in the general election, yes.  All of these districts that we draw are \ngoing to be democratic districts.  But that's not where the choice actually happens \nin these areas.   \n30 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 131,  PageID.4734   Filed 12/21/23   Page 31 of\n116\nNo. 1-22-cv-272 \nAgee et al. v. Benson et al. \n \nId. at 7483.  Adelson acknowledged that the Commission had data for only one statewide primary \nelection—“the 2018 gubernatorial primary,” which Handley had said was not probative in her \nanalysis—but Adelson said “we have to work with what we have.”  Id. at 7485.  He added that this \ncircumstance “is something that is a little different for me.  I really have not been in a situation \nwhere so few contested primary elections are on the table.”  Id. \n  Later, Adelson used the bellwether-elections tool (which one could fairly call a “general-\nelections  tool”)  to  check  the  Commission’s  work.    Again  he  found  that  African-American \n“candidates of choice prevail” in what became Senate District 10.  And again he said that “it’s \nimportant to remember the U.S. Supreme Court has been absolutely clear that if you put additional \nminority voters into a District beyond what is needed to elect candidates of choice that’s an issue.”  \nId. at 7489.  (Adelson never provided any legal support for that assertion.)   \nDuring this process, Adelson approved the “42-43%” goal for Oakland County, calling it \na “good kind of benchmark guidepost.”  Id. at 7495.  He also told the Commission that—unlike  \nCongressional plans, for which the Supreme Court requires the population of each district to be \nvery nearly the same—the Commission had “a lot more leeway” to deviate from that rule in \ndrawing state legislative districts.  Id. at 7500.  Adelson also said he approved of changes the \nCommission had recently made.  See, e.g., id. at 7509.  Eid said the opposite:  “I don’t like the \nchanges at all,” adding, “while it’s better for or might be better for VRA reasons it’s really much \nworse for community of interest reasons.”  Id. at 7510.  But Rothhorn reminded him that the \n“VRA” was “criteria number one,” adding, “I know it hurts believe me.”  Id.   \nThe Commission then determined that it had achieved its VRA compliance goals.  Only \nthen did it turn to partisan fairness and “compactness” considerations.  In doing so, however, the \nCommission focused almost exclusively on districts outside of the Detroit area.  \n31 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 131,  PageID.4735   Filed 12/21/23   Page 32 of\n116\nNo. 1-22-cv-272 \nAgee et al. v. Benson et al. \nThe Commission accordingly made no further changes to the Detroit-area districts and \nsaved its new draft as Draft Map 199.  The number of districts with black-voter population \npercentages above 50% now stood at zero—making Draft Map 199 “an almost final map.”  R.112 \nat PageID 3677. \nDistrict    1  3  6  8  10  11 \nNo.  \n  Date  BVAP  BVAP  BVAP  BVAP  BVAP  BVAP \nSenate  9/13/2021  10.98  50.82  76.56  63.77  18.1  7.8 \nMap Plan \n162 \nSenate  9/15/2021  34.86  44.87  51.99  59.06  49.38  11.02 \nMap Plan \n165 \nSenate  10/04/2021  36.73  43.35  40.03  42.45  41.20  18.42 \nMap Plan \n199 \n \n6. \n  More house revisions.  The House map still had some districts with BVAPs above 50%, \nhowever, and on October 5, the Commission returned to revising it.  The Commission decided to \nuse the “same process” it did in the senate, “going District by District looking at VRA[.]”  MICRC \nTr. at 7639.  As before, the commissioners used the “African/American dots” tool to help them see \nblack-voter populations as they mapped.  Id. at 7640.  The first to draft that day, Commissioner \nWeiss, told the mapping specialist he did not want to use the software’s neighborhoods overlay—\na tool for keeping neighborhoods whole if the Commission so chose—because “we are looking at \nVRA.”  Id. at 7642.  He then adjusted the district based primarily on its black-voter population \npercentage.  Id.   \nNext up, Commissioner Witjes worked on what became House District 10.  Id.  He too \nfocused on bringing the black-voter population in line with Adelson’s prior guidance.   Id.  Szetela \n32 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 131,  PageID.4736   Filed 12/21/23   Page 33 of\n116\nNo. 1-22-cv-272 \nAgee et al. v. Benson et al. \ncommented on his adjustments: “Brought it down quite a bit,” and “we have room to go north.”  \nId. at 7463.  Witjes brought the percentage “below 40%” and asked whether the “40% sweet spot \nstill appl[ies].”  Id. at 7644.  Adelson replied, “I think providing leeway, a little cushion here . . . is \nimportant.”  Id.  In what became District 11, however, Witjes’ changes had increased the black-\nvoter population above 50%.  Id. at 7646.  Clark asked, “Would it be acceptable to keep it that \nway?”  Id.  Adelson responded, “Looking at [what] the law says and what Dr. Handley analyzed \nand Dr. Handley’s analysis is in Wayne County BVAP and Black voters can elect candidates of \nchoice at 35% . . . . if you make a District a majority minority District . . . you get into more \ninvolved attempts at justification.”  Id.  Clark replied, “But you can’t change the places where \nthese people are living.  I mean it’s so concentrated.”  Id.  Adelson answered, “there are some \nlimitations about what you can do.  But having a population that is more than 20 points above what \nDr. Handley analyzed [] raises my eyebrow.  So to the extent it can be done absolutely.  And if it’s \nimpossible or unreasonabl[e] then that is [a] justification [we] have to deal with but until that point, \nI think making reasonable efforts at what the Voting Rights Act and the courts say and what Dr. \nHandley analyzed I think that that’s important.”  Id.  Witjes then continued mapping, sought to \nbring the percentages in both districts into line with Adelson’s directives, and succeeded.  See id. \nat 7647-48.  Adelson then checked the districts using the bellwether-elections tool and (as in every \nother instance) confirmed that “they all performed.”  Id. at 7650-51.  \nAs commissioners continued to revise the other Detroit-area districts, Adelson and Pastula \nrepeatedly reminded them of their targeted black-voter population percentages.  See e.g., id. at \n7652.  Adelson, for example, said, “remember it’s 35-40% in Wayne County.  40-45% in \nOakland.”   Id. at 7653.  The commissioners commented along the same lines as they worked.  For \nexample, Szetela told Clark that “when you add African/American population” to a district “you \n33 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 131,  PageID.4737   Filed 12/21/23   Page 34 of\n116\nNo. 1-22-cv-272 \nAgee et al. v. Benson et al. \nhave to take some off somewhere else.”  Id. at 7655.  Clark followed her advice and Szetela \nobserved, “you are down to 48 now 47” percent black-voter population.  Id. at 7656.  Adelson \napplauded the effort:  “Commissioner Clark, I think your adjustments have really made a lot of—\nhave  a  lot  of  positive  effect.”    Id.    The  Commission  then  worked  further  to  “dilute,”  as \nCommissioner Lett put it, the black-voter populations in what became Districts 1, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, \nand 14.  See id. at 7642-7679. \nAt this point, Dr. Handley joined the meeting remotely and gave the Commission a second, \nbrief presentation on partisan fairness.  For the most part she discussed some other states’ plans \nthat scored badly on various partisan-fairness metrics.  Pastula said, “none of the plans that the \nMICRC has put through have come close to those numbers . . . so that is very good news for the \nCommission indeed.”  Id. at 7683.  The Commission then returned to revising house districts \noutside the Detroit area.  At the end of the day on October 5, the Commission saved their House \nmap as Draft Map 204.  By that point, they had reduced the number of Detroit-area districts with \nBVAPs above 50% to zero. \nDistrict    1  7  8  10  11  12  14 \nNo.  \n  Date  BVAP  BVAP  BVAP  BVAP  BVAP  BVAP  BVAP \nHouse  9/28/2021  28.62  79.04  54.09  42.74  65.66  43.74  38.33 \nMap \nPlan 183 \nHouse  9/30/2021  36.58  66.54  50.37  58.44  49.23  43.74  39.21 \nMap \nPlan 193 \nHouse  10/05/2021  41.63  39.85  40.72  42.68  47.37  49.89  42.80 \nMap \nPlan 204 \n \n  The Commission completed further revisions to the house maps on October 6, but these \ndid not affect the Detroit-area districts.  See id. at 7726-34. \n34 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 131,  PageID.4738   Filed 12/21/23   Page 35 of\n116\nNo. 1-22-cv-272 \nAgee et al. v. Benson et al. \n \n7. \n“Compliance” analyses.  From October 6 to 11, the Commission did a partisan-fairness \nand population-deviation “compliance analysis” of its draft house and senate maps.  See, e.g., id. \nat 7733-34.  It began with the draft house map.  From the start, the Commission recognized that \nby “achieving VRA compliance we did get better partisan fairness scores.”  Id. at 7735.  It then \ndecided to take a “systematic approach” to improve those scores.  Id.  In doing so, however, the \nCommission also decided that since the districts in Detroit were “drawn that way for VRA reasons \n[it] might be a better idea to look at the other areas outside of Metro Detroit” to improve those \nmetrics.  See id. at 7737-81; 7867-77.  Later, Adelson echoed this point:  “my suggestion is we \navoid districts that have VRA implications” and that the Commission work on “districts that are \nnot in the Metro Detroit area.”  Id. at 7781.  The Commission followed this guidance:  “we do not \nwant to mess with 17, 14, because those are the VRA districts”, id. at 7782; “The reason I didn’t \n[change those districts] is because they are two VRA districts”, id. at 7785; “This was a VRA \nDistrict that we tried really hard to get it as high as possible African/American vote.  And we had \nlots of comments from Mr. Adelson that we should keep it as good as we got it”, id. at 7802; “I \ndon’t want to go back into Detroit.  I think it’s a spider’s web to try to sort out again.  I think we \ngot it as I recall the way we want it”, id. at 7816.  This approach worked and changes in other areas \nimproved the maps’ partisan fairness metrics.  See id. at 7826. \nThe Commission simultaneously addressed population deviations in their draft plans.  As \nto the so-called “VRA districts,” however, Adelson repeatedly told the Commission not to worry \ntoo much about population deviations, reiterating that “VRA compliance is a legitimate rationale \nfor population[] deviations.”  Id. at 7835.  He then recommended “looking at districts first that are \n35 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 131,  PageID.4739   Filed 12/21/23   Page 36 of\n116\nNo. 1-22-cv-272 \nAgee et al. v. Benson et al. \nout of the VRA semicircle . . . . And then we can see where we are at that point.”  Id.  Again, the \nCommission followed his advice and reduced the population deviations in districts outside of the \nDetroit-metro area.  See, e.g., id. at 7836-52; 7896-7902. \nThe Commission then turned to the draft senate map, addressing partisan fairness and \npopulation deviations simultaneously “to kill two birds with one stone.”  Id. at 7960.  As before, \nthe Commission sought to avoid significant changes to VRA districts:  “14 was drawn that way \nwith Pontiac for VRA reasons so we might not want to change that one too much”, id. at 7960; \n“Are we identifying also VRA districts where we want to not change the deviation?”, id. at 7961; \n“Before any changes are made maybe we should jot down the VRA numbers just to make sure we \ndon’t mess something up”, id.; “That is a VRA let’s put a check on it and move on”, id. at 7976; \n“We decided we had that as good as we could possibly get it for VRA and did not want to touch \nthat at all.  So I think we have to undo that”, id. at 7983; “there was something about 11 that we \nneed to be careful of.  But it does not seem to be a VRA District”, id. at 8044; “District 11 did not \nhave a significant Black age voting population, right?”, id.; “I just wanted to point out that several \nof these districts are delicately balanced as far as minority population . . . . Just as an FYI as the [] \nadjustments are being made”, id. at 8046; “we are not going to be able to get [perfect partisan-\nfairness scores] because of how we have drawn some of the VRA districts to be compliant . . . . So \nI think this is a good map”, id. at 8053.  The Commission eventually made small changes to what \nbecame Senate Districts 1, 3, 10, and 11.  See id. at 7987-88.  As it did so, however, the \nCommission continually checked its racial-percentages tool to ensure that it did not compromise \nits VRA goals.  See, e.g., id. at 7991-94.   \nLater, the Commission returned to the draft house map and made further revisions to \nimprove partisan fairness and population deviation.  Id. at 8074.  Again it focused on districts \n36 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 131,  PageID.4740   Filed 12/21/23   Page 37 of\n116\nNo. 1-22-cv-272 \nAgee et al. v. Benson et al. \noutside of Detroit.  See, e.g., 8074-8081.  The Commission was careful to avoid moving black-\nvoter population percentages out of the target ranges.  See, e.g., id. at 8081-86.  But it found (as \nOrton pointed out) that the “VRA districts that we worked so hard on” had caused the largest \npopulation deviations.  See id. at 8087-88.  Orton said “I just have to accept [the deviations in VRA \ndistricts] . . . I mean we may be able to make some improvements but I don’t think we will be able \nto change the plan deviation.”  Clark agreed.  But Adelson again reassured the Commission that \n“compliance with the Voting Rights Act” was a “legitimate state justification” for the deviations.  \nId.  \nYet Szetela thought they could reduce deviations in VRA districts without “making \nchanges to the VRA levels[,]” because “we know where the African/American population is” \naround those districts.  Id. at 8089.  Witjes pushed back, saying these districts “were carefully \ncrafted with VRA in mind.  So if we were to start messing with that, we could be opening up \nanother can of worms.”  Id.  at 8090.  Szetela persisted and she (and other commissioners) later \nmade small changes to what became House Districts 10 and 11, among others.  See id. at 8090-91.  \nBut the Commission made sure those changes did not move the black-voter population percentages \nbeyond Adelson’s numbers.  See, e.g., id. at 8090-8102.  Throughout this process, commissioners \nfrequently used the racial-dots tool and referred to the “African/American” or “Black voting \npopulation.”  See id. at 8102-03.  After one such reference, Adelson (seemingly for the purpose of \nthe record) interjected:  “The changes that are being made have nothing to do with race.  Race is \nnot predominating these decisions as you are trying to equalize your population deviation.”  Id. at \n8103.   \nRemarkably, by negative implication, Adelson then suggested that race could lawfully \npredominate when drawing the so-called VRA districts:  “So if decisions were being made[,] if \n37 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 131,  PageID.4741   Filed 12/21/23   Page 38 of\n116\nNo. 1-22-cv-272 \nAgee et al. v. Benson et al. \nrace was the primary consideration without having anything to do with the VRA, that is another \nissue.” Id. at 8104 (emphasis added.)  But these changes, Adelson said, were “deviation related.”   \nId.  \nBy the end of October 8, the Commission had completed Draft House Plan 227, which it \nlater named “Pine.”   \nDistrict    1  7  8  10  11  12  14 \nNo.  \n  Date  BVAP  BVAP  BVAP  BVAP  BVAP  BVAP  BVAP \nHouse  10/08/2021  41.63  39.85  40.72  42.05  48.00  49.89  42.80 \nMap, \nPine \n \nThe Commission had also completed Draft Senate Plan 220, which later it named “Cherry.” \nDistrict    1  3  6  8  10  11 \nNo.  \n  Date  BVAP  BVAP  BVAP  BVAP  BVAP  BVAP \nSenate  10/07/2021  37.04  42.84  40.64  42.45  36.63  20.02 \nMap,  \nCherry \n \nNeither map had any Detroit-area districts with black-voter populations above 50%. \nC. \n  Public reaction to the draft plans.  The Commission then commenced a new round of \npublic hearings throughout Michigan; the one that matters here was held in Detroit, at the TCF \nCenter, on October 20.  Before that hearing, however, Detroit-area current and former state \nlawmakers, along with other community leaders, held a press conference in which they sharply \ncriticized the Commission’s proposed maps.  See Pl.’s Ex. 130 at 2.  A news publication reported \nthat one legislator said, “[t]he commission has drawn zero [black majority districts], and that’s an \nunacceptable change . . . . That doesn’t elect Black candidates, it doesn’t do Black people any \n38 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 131,  PageID.4742   Filed 12/21/23   Page 39 of\n116\nNo. 1-22-cv-272 \nAgee et al. v. Benson et al. \ngood, it is not helpful to our community, it is not helpful to our issues.”  Id. at 3.  Another legislator \nsaid, “The current plans have diluted our voting bloc . . . .  It will potentially take away all Black \nrepresentation, potentially all Detroit representation.”  Id. at 4.  The president of the Detroit Branch \nof the NAACP added, “We want maps that reflect who we are.”  Id. \n  Likewise, in the days before the TCF hearing, Michigan State University’s Institute for \nPublic Policy and Social Research published an analysis of the Commission’s proposed plans.  Its \nconclusions were unequivocal.  The draft Senate plans, it said \nare  extremely  unusual  in  engineering  maps  without  a  single  majority-Black \ndistrict. . . . These maps appear to deliberately dilute concentrations of Black voting \nage population above 50%, to create instead as many districts as possible in which \nthe Black vote constitutes a large majority above 35%. . . . [T]he probability that \nplans like these without a Black-majority district arise by chance are remote.  \nRather, these plans’ outcome with no majority-Black district, and twice as many \ndistricts with a large minority of Black voters as in most other plans, is attained by \ndesign, following the advice to the Commission formulated by its VRA Legal \nCounsel [i.e., Adelson] and its VRA Consultant [i.e., Handley].   \n \nSee  Jon  X.  Eguia,  “Michigan  Redistricting  Draft  Map  Analysis,”  at  46, \nhttps://ippsr.msu.edu/sites/default/files/SOSS/IPPSRRedistrictingReportvOct20v1.1.pdf  (last \nvisited Dec. 21, 2023).   \nThe MSU Institute’s assessment of the House plans was similar: \nThe 2011 redistricting map arguably packed Black voters around Metro Detroit so \nthat the number of such Black-majority districts increased to eleven . . . These \n[proposed] plans go in the opposite direction to an extraordinary extreme, arguably \ncracking the large majorities of Black voters to studiously avoid configuring a \nsingle district that would cross the 50% threshold of Black voters.  By diluting the \nconcentration of Black voters in the districts with the greatest share of them, these \nplans manage to generate an improbably high number of districts with over 40% \nand over 35% of Black voters. \n \nId. at 64.  In summary, the Institute concluded, the “absence of majority-Black districts is \n \nextraordinary, and impossible to arise except by careful design.”  Id. at 75. \n39 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 131,  PageID.4743   Filed 12/21/23   Page 40 of\n116\nNo. 1-22-cv-272 \nAgee et al. v. Benson et al. \n  The reaction of Detroit residents at the TCF hearing itself, one can fairly say, was \nvociferous.  Over the course of nine hours, more than 200 residents commented on the proposed \nplans.  Most commenters were highly critical; a plurality of them complained specifically about \ncracking and the absence of any black-majority districts.  A handful of examples are enough to \nconvey the hearing’s tenor.  A former state legislator said, “it was not for you to peel off parts of \nDetroit and throw them in communities we have nothing in common with. Bloomfield Hills, \nBirmingham, Canton, Farmington, Madison Heights, New Baltimore and Sterling Heights.  How \ncan we advocate for the community when we are cracked into eight parts[?]”  Id. at 8223.  Another \ncommenter said, “Your plan for the next ten years denies Black [and] Brown [people] in Michigan \nthe opportunity to select representatives from their neighborhoods to send to Lansing.”  Id. at 8218.  \nAnother said: \nI’m really outraged at the way these maps are breaking up the north end and \neliminating the political power of the people in the City of Detroit. . . .  It’s unfair.  \nPut  the north end back together. Keep it intact. Boston Edison, Hamtramck, \nHighland Park east side of Detroit, Senate District 2 now includes even the Grosse \nPointe areas.  Don’t immigrate us to negate us and leave Black districts intact.   \n \nId. at 8256-57.  Another Detroiter said:  “We know that you can draw better maps for Black \nMichiganders.  Honor the Voting Rights Act to ensure Black people are able to elect leaders that \nlook like themselves.  Let’s not return to the Jim [C]row politics of old.”  Id. at 8215.  Another \nsaid, “we want to ensure that Black folks are kept [a] majority minority [in] our districts.”  Id. at \n8220; see also, e.g., id. at 8233, 8241, 8261, 8320.  Another cut to the heart of their complaints, \nsaying a “majority of Black Detroit deserves the chance to be represented by Detroiters.  Not just \npeople that might share [a] political party.”  Id. at 8222.     \n40 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 131,  PageID.4744   Filed 12/21/23   Page 41 of\n116\nNo. 1-22-cv-272 \nAgee et al. v. Benson et al. \nSome commenters made legal observations.  The Executive Director of the Michigan Civil \nRights Commission, for example, told the commissioners that its draft Detroit-area districts \n“violate Federal civil rights law”: \nThey dilute majority minority districts and strip the ability for minority voter to \nelect  legislatures  [that]  reflect  their  community  and  effect  any  meaningful \nopportunity to impact public policy and law making.  If you approve any of your \nmaps, we believe that you will be violating both Federal statutory and case law.   \n \nId. at 8264.  And an NAACP member cited a legal rule about which the Commission had heard \nvery little during its own meetings:  “[W]e do not appreciate the way the maps have been drawn \nto date.  We want to remind you that the 14th [A]mendment prohibits legislatures and this \nCommission from engaging in both intentional and race[] based voter dilution and racial sorting.”  \nId. at 8303.   \nD. \n  The “closed session.” On October 27—nine days before its November 5 deadline for \npublishing maps ahead of the 45-day public comment period—the Commission held its first \nmeeting after the TCF hearing.  It promptly voted to go into “closed session” (meaning closed to \nthe public)—something it had never done before—to discuss two purportedly “privileged and \nconfidential” memoranda from Adelson.  Id. at 8754.  The meeting was not transcribed at the time; \nbut it was recorded.  (The Michigan Supreme Court later ordered the recording to be made public.) \n  General Counsel Pastula began the meeting by announcing the “rules of the closed \nsession,” namely that “none of the discussion topics or documents may be shared outside of this \nroom.”  R.126-1 at PageID 4571.  The commissioners had been told to sign a confidentiality \nagreement:  Pastula said, “everyone [has] received the confidentiality agreement,” and told the \ncommissioners to return to their signed copies to her or Sue Ann Hammersmith, the Commission’s \n41 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 131,  PageID.4745   Filed 12/21/23   Page 42 of\n116\nNo. 1-22-cv-272 \nAgee et al. v. Benson et al. \nExecutive Director.  Id.  Adelson—who did not attend the TCF hearing—then took the floor, \nsaying among other things:   \nWe [i.e., himself and Pastula] have become concerned that there is so much \nmisinformation out there.  We wanted to have an opportunity to set the record \nstraight in a sense, provide our advice, provide you with information about what \nthe law actually says[.]”  \n \nId. at PageID 4573.   \n \n   Adelson insisted that the VRA “does not require any numerical amount of majority-\nminority districts; indeed, does not even require majority-minority districts at all.”  Id. at PageID \n4572.  The public comments to the contrary at the TCF hearing, Adelson said, were “woefully \nmisleading.”  Id. at PageID 4578.  Throughout the closed session, Adelson and Pastula variously \ndescribed these comments as “infused with either misinformation or lack of information,” based \non “specific agendas,” and “flat out incorrect.”  Id. at PageID 4578, 4596, 4608.   \n  Adelson also discussed the lack of primary data available to the Commission during its \nmapping process.  But he reassured the commissioners that, “while primaries can provide useful \ninformation, please be advised that . . . they’re not necessarily dispositive.”  Id. at PageID 4577.  \nAdelson also discussed the importance of the Commission’s record for the purpose of any future \nlitigation challenging the maps, saying: \none of the things we have to stress, emphasize, insist on, plead, beg and say please, \nplease don’t use phrases about adding black people, subtracting black people, \nadding white people, subtracting white people.   \n \nId. at PageID 4579.  He added, “one of the reasons we wanted to have this session is that in looking \nto the future, looking over the next eight days, we don’t want to give people out there specific \npaths  to  challenge  what  you’re  doing.    Remember  .  .  .  legally,  race  cannot  predominate \nredistricting.  It can be one factor of many.”  Id.   \n42 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 131,  PageID.4746   Filed 12/21/23   Page 43 of\n116\nNo. 1-22-cv-272 \nAgee et al. v. Benson et al. \n  Adelson then referenced one of the Commission’s earlier decisions to keep together \ncommunities of interest in the Flint area.  Id. at PageID 4580-81.  He said that “a path forward” \nfor the Commission might be to mimic that approach in the Detroit-area districts, “rather than \nfocus on race predominantly.”  Id.   Eid asked, “so, how do we do that without packing the \ndistricts?”  Id.  Commissioner Kellom replied: \nI think what I hear Bruce saying is the rhetoric and language that we use to justify.  \nSo, like, what we’re actually doing in reunifying folks is of course, we’re putting \ncertain races together, we know that.  But then what we say is that we’re observing \nthe fact that these areas are uniquely different, like when we think about Detroit.  \nSo we’re not using the language that is going to question the maps when it gets to \nthat point.  So I think if we go back and look at the cultural aspects and the \nneighborhoods . . . the places that are completely black [laughing] just saying it like \nthat, um, will be, the undertones will be accomplishing what folks want but doing \nit in a way that still upholds our criterion. \n \nId. at PageID 4581-82.  Adelson suggested that the commissioners focus their future discussions \non keeping “neighborhoods” and “communities” whole.  See id. at PageID 4582-86.  Orton echoed \nhis advice:  “when we’re talking about this, if we choose to put anything together that we currently \nhave separated, we go back to the communities of interest, it’s a communities of interest thing not \na VRA thing.”  Id. at PageID 4588.  Clark then replied to Adelson: \nDetroit’s different.  And so your comments were—it appears to be a neighborhood \nissue and they want to have the neighborhoods consolidated.  So we can do that and \nmake minor modifications to the districts we’ve done.  But that to me doesn’t fix \nthe problem that they [Black voters] were complaining about.  The problem they \nwere complaining about was, in my mind, was that the districts didn’t give them \n[Black voters] the opportunity to elect.  And so changing just the neighborhoods, \nit’s not going to change that problem.  So the way to change that would be to make \nthe districts compress them so that more of the blacks are in Detroit. \n \nId. at PageID 4594.  Commissioner Lett offered a suggestion about how the Commission could \nmake changes to Detroit-area districts: \n[C]ommunities of interest was created as a nebulous criteria that the redistricting \ncommission could use later as cover for whatever map it draws. Communities of \ninterest is a will-o’-the-wisp.  It’s a wreath of smoke. It can be whatever is \n43 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 131,  PageID.4747   Filed 12/21/23   Page 44 of\n116\nNo. 1-22-cv-272 \nAgee et al. v. Benson et al. \nnecessary, the crucial thing is who decides what a community of interest is that gets \npreserved.  The answer?  The Commission does.  Who gets to review that?  Frankly, \nnobody does.  It’s up to them.  Was it originally intended?  Yes.  It was built in as \nnailing Jell-O to the wall. . . . that’s what we can use now to justify what we’re \ndoing.  And it’s in the amendment. They put it in there.  So let’s use what we got. \n \nId. at PageID 4602.  Lett concluded by saying the Commission could use communities of interest \nto  “provide  ourselves  with  cover.    We  can  do  it.    Tomorrow.”    Id.  at  PageID  4602-03.  \nCommissioner Eid responded:  “I agree with everything Steve [Lett] just said.”  Id. at PageID \n4603-04. \n  But Kellom said, “I can’t ignore the people that are talking about how Southfield is ripped \nup, and that is true.  How Palmer Park is ripped up, and that is true . . . . the Detroit area is jacked \nup and we need to change it.  And I don’t want us to sit here and start think about ways we can \nkeep it the same.”  Id. at PageID 4607.  Lett reassured Kellom: “Nobody in this room is saying we \ncan’t go in and make changes.  The only thing that we are saying is when we make those changes, \nwe need to be cognizant of the VRA and how we’re doing that.”  Id. at PageID 4612.  Pastula \nadded, “I would strongly advise you to listen to your lawyers” on this topic.  Id. at PageID 4613.  \nOrton agreed and reminded Kellom:  “remember the wording.  This can fall under communities of \ninterest.”  Id. \nAs the closed session wound up, Clark then reminded the other commissioners:  “Anything \ndiscussed in this room today should stay in this room period . . . . Not discussed with anybody.” \nId.  at  PageID  4617.    Pastula  then  reminded  them  all  to  return  their  signed  confidentiality \nagreements.  Id. \nE. \n  Post-TCF changes.  Over the next week, the Commission finalized its draft senate and \nhouse maps.  The Commission made minimal changes to the draft senate maps, none of which \n44 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 131,  PageID.4748   Filed 12/21/23   Page 45 of\n116\nNo. 1-22-cv-272 \nAgee et al. v. Benson et al. \nsubstantially affected the BVAPs in Detroit-area districts.  See R.112 at PageID 3677-78; MICRC \nTr at 8919-47, 9003-15.  According to Szetela, however, Kellom and Rothhorn came to her and \nsaid they “wanted to increase the black voting age population” some Detroit-area house districts \nand that they had “had a discussion with Bruce Adelson that they could do that as long as they \nused neighborhoods as the basis.”  R.112 at PageID 3718. \nOn November 2, the Commission began revising the draft house maps.  See MICRC Tr. at \n9157.  At first, commissioners made only “small changes” to improve metrics such as population \ndeviation.  See, e.g., id. at 9164-9200.  But then Rothhorn announced that he and Kellom had been \n“working together” on an “overlay” that included some “major changes” to certain Detroit-area \ndistricts.  Id. at 9199-9201.  Kellom and Rothhorn said that they had done so because they were \nconcerned about the comments the Commission had received at the TCF hearing, and wanted to \n“honor[] our third criteria of diversity and COIs.”  Id. at 9199-9204.  Orton asked whether the map \naffected “VRA districts.”   Id. at 9202.  Kellom responded, “yes”; but Rothhorn said, “yes and no \nwe don’t know if we got it right.  It’s more communities of interest changes.”  Id. \n  The Commission decided to create an alternate map based on Kellom and Rothhorn’s \noverlay.  To do so, it deleted most of the districts in Detroit and drew new ones based on the \noverlay.  Id. at 9202.  As the draft progressed, Kellom explained that their map “honors the COIs” \nby reuniting “some of the [Detroit] neighborhoods.”  Id. at 9206-07.  She also said that Adelson \nhad told them that, with that rationale, they “could increase BVAP” in Detroit-area districts.   Id. \nat 9204.  \nSzetela responded that Kellom’s suggestion “was not consistent with what I was hearing \nfrom Detroit.  I don’t remember [] individual commenters saying they wanted neighborhoods put \nback together.  I remember a lot of comments about wanting minority majority districts with more \n45 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 131,  PageID.4749   Filed 12/21/23   Page 46 of\n116\nNo. 1-22-cv-272 \nAgee et al. v. Benson et al. \nthan  50% African/American and  I don’t remember much of  anything about neighborhoods \nhonestly.”  Id. at 9207.   \nPastula interjected, “I think what I hear Commissioner Kellom discuss is, again, the third \ncriteria of diversity and communities of interest” and that “the focus of uniting neighborhoods that \n. . . I hear Commissioner Kellom attempting to do . . . . wouldn’t have VRA implications . . . . \nwould not have a Voting Rights Act component.”  Id. at 9207.  Pastula added that if “the comments \nwere advocating more than 50% majority minority districts based on VRA,” then that “would \nlikely be held to constitute racial gerrymandering.  And, again, that would create VRA issues.  \nWhat—where I see this conversation happening is not rooted or anchored in the VRA at all.”   Id.  \nIn the same vein, Kellom said, “this whole week I’ve been talking about neighborhoods.  I \nspecifically did not mention the VRA.”  Id. at 9208.  Curry added, “communities of interest is all \nabout neighborhoods.”  Id. \n  Chair Szetela was skeptical:  “I think to me the biggest issue is you’re mentioning these \ncommunities  of  interest  but  when  we  collaboratively  mapped,  we  discussed  many,  many \ncommunities  of  interest,”  but  “what  is  happening  here  is  that  you  and  [Rothhorn]  and \nCommissioner Curry have individually decided which communities of interest you think are \nimportant for this area.  And you’re asking us as a collective to just accept them without \nconsideration[.]”  Id. at 9209.  But Lett responded, “I think [Rothhorn] is trying to do what Detroit \nwants done.”  Id. at 9217. \nThe Commission moved ahead with the new draft.  Kellom and Rothhorn’s overlay guided \nthe mapping process, but the Commission also continued to rely on the racial-dots tool and their \nknowledge of the racial makeup of the area as they mapped:  “I think the dots are good”, id. at \n9217; “they are also pretty much the Black African neighborhoods too”, id. at 9218; “when you \n46 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 131,  PageID.4750   Filed 12/21/23   Page 47 of\n116\nNo. 1-22-cv-272 \nAgee et al. v. Benson et al. \nlook at Finkle and Dexter they are predominately Black African/Americans”, id. at 9219; “if it \ncomes down to deciding between neighborhoods it might be a good idea to think about which of \nthe minority groups in the neighborhood vote the same way”, id. at 9225; “7 is 68% nonwhite”, \nid. at 9237.  But Commissioner Kellom continued to try and justify the changes on other grounds \nwhile the mapping progressed:  “This is about the Detroit community,” so “open up your hearts \nand your minds.  This comes from a very sincere place.”  Id. at 9230. \nThe new draft revised what became House Districts 1, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, and 14.  See, e.g., \nid. at 9240, 9253.  The Commission eventually reached a stopping place and decided to check the \nmap’s “demographics,” i.e., black-voter percentages.  Some other Detroit-area house districts now \nhad BVAPs above 50%.   Adelson commented on these changes:   \nThis is—as you know we have discussed the VRA analysis and Dr. Handley’s \nanalysis. And there has been nothing that I’m aware of where any of you have said \nwe need to put more Black people in a certain area beyond what the Voting Rights \nAct says. When you take that and then look at the reunifying neighborhoods that is \na different consideration. . . . I think the numbers are an improvement in the sense \nof responding to concerns about that I took to be community based. So those are \nmy thoughts. \n \nId. at 9256.   \n  Szetela asked, “So you’re okay with 55%, 54.9% Black VAP . . . I just want to confirm \nthat you think that is acceptable.”  Id.  Adelson answered, “I’m fine with that from the perspective \nof what was discussed today.”  Id. at 9256-57.   \nThe Commission’s meeting the next day, November 3, began with a short public-comment \nperiod.  A regular observer of the Commission’s meetings, Sarah Howard of the AFL-CIO Fair \nMaps Project, commented on the revisions made the day before.  Specifically, she questioned why \ncommunities of interests had been honored then but not before: \nLast night Mr. Adelson said districts can go as high as 55% BVAP as long as it is \na side effect of recognizing a community of interest and not an explicit attempt to \n47 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 131,  PageID.4751   Filed 12/21/23   Page 48 of\n116\nNo. 1-22-cv-272 \nAgee et al. v. Benson et al. \ncreate a majority minority District. This is frankly [] an astonishing reversal. You \nmust reassess all VRA districts based on community of interest testimony. We \ndoubt for example that Birmingham and Detroit are a genuine community of \ninterest. And find it very objectionable they had to protest the low BVAP targets. \nYou missed out on a ton of community of interest data because they were under the \nincorrect impression their communities of interest didn’t matter for this analysis.   \n \nId. at 9264-65.  The Commission thanked her for comments and moved on.   \nOver the next two days, the Commission revised house districts in other areas of Michigan.  \nNone of these changes, however, substantially affected the November 2 adjustments to the Detroit \ndistricts.  See id. at 9399-9400 (pointing out that the Commission imported all the November 2 \nDetroit-area districts into the map finalized on November 4).  On November 4, the Commission \nmade its final edits to the Detroit-area house districts.  In doing so, it again reviewed black-voter \npopulations and “VRA compliance” for many of those districts.  (E.g., “That is an Oakland County \nVRA District where we are trying to keep it above 40”, id. at 9406; “This is one of our VRA \ndistricts we did not want to mess with”, id. at 9407; “Black voting age population is 44.17”, id. at \n9410; “District 18 is now 45.34% Black”, id. at 9419.)  \nAt  the  close  of  their  work  on  November  4,  the  Commission  named  its  house  map \n“Hickory,” renumbered its districts, and advanced it to a 45-day public comment period.  See id. \nat 9484-85.  The Commission also renamed its last senate draft “Linden,” renumbered its districts, \nand advanced it to public comment.  Id. at 9503.

Is this possible?”  R.114-6 at Page ID 3982.  \n49 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 131,  PageID.4753   Filed 12/21/23   Page 50 of\n116\nNo. 1-22-cv-272 \nAgee et al. v. Benson et al. \nApparently that discussion took place within a day or so, by way of a “Teams” meeting; \nbecause the next day Pastula sent an email to the Commission’s “Legal Team” of outside counsel \n(all or most of them litigators, including three who have represented the Commission in this case).  \nPastula referred back to Handley’s September 2 presentation to the Commission—which provided \nthe “analysis” on which all the Commission’s BVAP efforts had been based—and reported the \nfollowing: \nI did want to circulate the information from the Teams meeting and we can \naddress/more fully discuss when appropriate how to present this information to our \nclient [i.e., the Commission] prior to their vote.  As indicated during the call, the \npercentage ranges provided by Dr. Handley in her September presentation/charts \nand utilized during drafting did not correspond to the information she shared today.  \nThe lack of primary election data generally as well as promised information \nregarding whether the white candidates are candidates of choice . . . are relevant.  \n \n  R.114-7 at PageID 3984 (emphasis added). \n \nApparently one of the participants in the “Teams” meeting told Chair Szetela about it; \nbecause on December 15 she emailed Pastula as follows: \nI am deeply concerned to have learned that you personally became aware of critical \nissues with Dr. Handley’s VRA analysis earlier this week and, in addition to not \nnotifying the Commission about this alarming development, have also directed staff \nmembers, vendors, and the [Secretary of State staff] not to alert Commissioners as \nto the issue until the week of December 28th—almost two weeks away.  It’s my \nunderstanding that Dr. Handley has informed you, staff, vendors, and members of \nthe [Secretary of State staff] that her analysis was deeply flawed and that, as a result \nof her flawed analysis, not a single one of our Senate maps are VRA compliant.  \n. . .  In addition, it’s my understanding that you were hoping to conceal this \ninformation from the public by having yet another closed session the week of the \n28th, which contradicts our mission, vision, and values.   \n \nPl.’s Ex. 5 at 69.  \n \nOn December 27, Szetela also emailed Handley directly, and pointedly asked whether “for \nthe Michigan State Senate, districts with BVAP of 47% or lower” are “able to elect candidates of \n50 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 131,  PageID.4754   Filed 12/21/23   Page 51 of\n116\nNo. 1-22-cv-272 \nAgee et al. v. Benson et al. \nchoice.”  Id. at 21-22.   Handley replied that the “minority preferred candidate wins all of the \ngeneral election[s] above 35%” black-voter population.  But she added: \nUnfortunately, we do not have sufficient information to anticipate what might \nhappen in the future Democratic primaries in the proposed districts.  The reason is \nthat we have only one statewide Democratic primary for which we can recompile \nresults and minority voters were not cohesive in this primary.  We simply do not \nknow what would happen in a primary in which minority voters are cohesive.   \n \nId. at 21. \n \n2. \nOn December 28, at 10 a.m., the Commission reconvened to approve the final senate and \nhouse maps.  Some commissioners said they were unhappy with the maps; others said they were \nhappy with them.  Szetela suggested that “we make some changes to accommodate public \ncomments . . . particularly around VRA issues and particularly with primaries and democratic \nprimaries and are these maps representative and do they actually provide the Black community in \nDetroit with the ability to elect.  I think these are things we need to think seriously about[.]”  Id. at \n9877.  Eid and Pastula alike said there was no time for that.  So did Secretary of State Benson’s \nrepresentative at the meeting.  See MICRC Tr. at 9875, 9878-80.   \nApparently, Dr. Handley had provided the Commission with her “report” an hour or two \nbefore (she undisputedly gave it to them that same day).  Rothhorn’s impression of the report was \nthat further “analysis must be undertaken” to confirm that black-preferred candidates could \nactually prevail in districts with the BVAP numbers that Handley had given them on September 2.  \nId. at 9880.  Adelson gave a lengthy response in which (to summarize) he said that “I have no \nconcerns based on her analysis that there are VRA compliance issues, issues that need to be \naddressed.”   Id. at 9881.  Szetela replied: \nSo, Mr. Adelson, so my specific concern reading Dr. Handley’s report is that when \nwe were in Detroit . . .  the comment we heard over and over and over again is you \n51 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 131,  PageID.4755   Filed 12/21/23   Page 52 of\n116\nNo. 1-22-cv-272 \nAgee et al. v. Benson et al. \nhave to look at the primaries and we all know this is true especially in Districts that \nare heavily leaning democratic or republican the primary is where the real action is \nat for the election, whoever wins the primary is going to win the seat in that \nparticular District.  \n \nAnd so we heard that very specific comments that we have to look at the primaries \nand very specific concerns about voter turnout which is also addressed in Handley’s \nreport as well and specifically the concern that when you have 35% or less than a \ncertain number in districts which are supposedly VRA districts, those percentages \nfor the Black community are not going to translate to the ability to win primary \nelections. And what I’m seeing in Dr. Handley’s report is she has since validated \nthat concern.  \n \nId. at 9882-83.  Adelson answered: \nI disagree with your characterization of Dr. Handley’s report she did not say 48% \nBVAP is required for bloc voters to elect candidates of choice. Much of the \ncontrary. . . And  her  conclusion  is  that,  yes,  without—with  the  absence  of \nadditional primary election data we have to rely on what we have. What we have \nare general election results, recompiled election results, the gubernatorial primary \nfrom 2018.  \n \nId. at 9883-84.   \nSzetela said that Dr. Handley’s report “was a canary in the coal mine” and that she \n“continue[d] to have concerns because I want to make sure we do right by Detroit. I want to make \nsure we do right by the Black population, with our ability to elect who they want to elect.”  Id. at \n9884-85.  Kellom said she had “the same concern.”  Id.  But Adelson said that “this is not October \nor early November.  And there are issues that have been discussed with the reality of the calendar.  \nSo you know I appreciate your comments and your including me in the discussion.”  Id. at 9888. \nThe Commission proceeded to adopt—as its final redistricting plans—the “Linden” plan \nfor the Senate and the “Hickory” plan for the House.  The Linden plan reduced the number of \nmajority-black senate districts in the Detroit area from two to zero; the Hickory plan reduced the \nsame numbers for the House from ten to six.  None of the districts challenged here have BVAPs \nat 50% or higher. \n52 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 131,  PageID.4756   Filed 12/21/23   Page 53 of\n116\nNo. 1-22-cv-272 \nAgee et al. v. Benson et al. \nG. \n  In March 2022, plaintiffs brought this suit against the Commission and Michigan Secretary \nof State Jocelyn Benson.  In their complaint, plaintiffs challenged seven Detroit-area senate \ndistricts (1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 10, and 11) and ten Detroit-area house districts (1, 2, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, \nand 26) under both the U.S. Constitution’s Equal Protection Clause and § 2 of the Voting Rights \nAct.   The parties thereafter filed cross-motions for summary judgment.  We denied plaintiffs’ \nmotion and granted defendants’ motion in part.  Specifically—on various grounds, some of them \njurisdictional—we granted summary judgment to defendants on four of plaintiffs’ equal-protection \nclaims (against House Districts 2, 13, and 26, and Senate District 5) and on eight of plaintiffs’ \nVRA claims (against House Districts 2, 8, 11, 13, and 26, and Senate Districts 5, 10, and 11).  We \ndenied summary judgment to defendants on thirteen of plaintiffs’ equal-protection claims (namely, \nagainst House Districts 1, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, and 14, and Senate Districts 1, 3, 6, 8, 10, and 11).  All \nthose claims proceeded to a six-day bench trial, held in November 2023.  \n  At trial, the parties called eleven fact witnesses, including six commissioners (Szetela, \nRothhorn, Curry, Lange, Wagner, and Eid), Bruce Adelson, Dr. Lisa Handley, Virgil Smith (a \nformer state senator from Detroit), and LaMar Lemmons III (a former house representative from \nDetroit).  We discuss their testimony as relevant below.  The parties also presented the testimony \nof five experts:  Sean Trende, Dr. Handley, Dr. Brad Lockerbie, Dr. Maxwell Palmer, and Dr. \nJonathan Rodden, all of whom submitted an expert report (Trende also submitted a supplemental \nreport).  Their testimony, as it turns out, is less important to our decision here.  The parties also \nsubmitted more than 100 exhibits as evidence, including a complete transcript of the Commission’s \nproceedings, which totaled 10,603 pages.  About 1800 pages of that transcript are particularly \n53 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 131,  PageID.4757   Filed 12/21/23   Page 54 of\n116\nNo. 1-22-cv-272 \nAgee et al. v. Benson et al. \nimportant here.  This court has reviewed all the evidence in the record, including every page of the \nCommission’s transcript. \nII. \nThe Fourteenth Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause “limits racial gerrymanders in \nlegislative redistricting plans.”  Cooper, 581 U.S. at 291.  Specifically—absent some compelling \ninterest which a racial gerrymander is narrowly tailored to serve—the Equal Protection Clause \nbars a State “from ‘separating its citizens into different voting districts on the basis of race.’”  Id. \n(quoting Bethune-Hill, 580 U.S. at 187).   \nTo prove an unconstitutional racial gerrymander, a plaintiff must prove that “‘race was the \npredominant factor motivating’” the State’s “‘decision to place a significant number of voters \nwithin or without a particular district.’” Cooper, 581 U.S. at 291 (quoting Miller v. Johnson, 515 \nU.S. 900, 916 (1995)).  To make that showing, a plaintiff must show that the State “subordinated \nother factors” to “racial considerations.”  Id. (cleaned up).  A plaintiff can make that showing \n“even if the evidence reveals that [the State] elevated race to the predominant criterion in order to \nadvance other goals, including political ones.”  Id. at 291 n.1; see also Miller, 515 U.S. at 914 \n(stating that the “use of race as a proxy” for “political interest[s]” is “prohibit[ed]”).   \nWe determine predominance district-by-district, though a plaintiff, “of course, can present \nstatewide evidence in order to prove racial gerrymandering in a particular district.”  Ala. Legis. \nBlack Caucus v. Alabama, 575 U.S. 254, 263 (2015) (emphasis omitted).  A plaintiff can show \nracial predominance “though ‘direct evidence’” of the State’s intent, or circumstantial evidence, \nor “a mix of both.”  Cooper, 581 U.S. at 291.  Evidence of “an announced racial target that \nsubordinated other districting criteria” is important evidence “that race predominated” in drawing \na district.  Id. at 300-01; see also Ala. Legis. Black Caucus, 575 U.S. at 267.     \n54 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 131,  PageID.4758   Filed 12/21/23   Page 55 of\n116\nNo. 1-22-cv-272 \nAgee et al. v. Benson et al. \nA. \nThe record here is almost oceanic in its direct evidence of intent.  The relevant state actor \nin  this  case  is  the  Commission.    And  the  entirety  of  the  Commission’s  proceedings—the \ncommissioners’ every word, as they drew every district, line-by-line, and often precinct-by-\nprecinct—was transcribed.  The thousands of pages of those transcripts reveal not only the \ncommissioners’ every move as they drew and redrew legislative-district lines; it reveals also their \nreasoning, their motivations, their misgivings, in real time as they worked.  In that respect this case \nis singular.  We have carefully considered all the evidence in the record, including the testimony \nof six commissioners at trial, some two years after the fact.  But the transcripts of the Commission’s \nproceedings are by far the most important and most probative evidence in the record here.  Our \nfindings based on this record now follow. \n1. \n  Our first group of findings concern the Commission’s mapping process for Detroit-area \ndistricts generally. \na. \nBVAP targets for Detroit-area districts.  First, the Commission plainly acted under the \nconstraint of across-the-board racial targets as it drew the boundaries of Detroit-area districts.  By \nway  of  background,  and  to  reiterate  somewhat,  Dr.  Handley  advised  the  Commission—on \nSeptember 2, 2021, at the outset of its map-drawing process—about the BVAPs necessary for \nblack voters to be able consistently to elect their “candidates of choice.”  Specifically, she said, \n“[i]n Oakland County, 35% is going to work.  40 percent looks like it might work.  In Wayne \nCounty where we have a lot more white crossover vote 35% might well work.”  MICRC Tr. at \n5386.  (Those percentages were based only on general-election data, which rendered them close \n55 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 131,  PageID.4759   Filed 12/21/23   Page 56 of\n116\nNo. 1-22-cv-272 \nAgee et al. v. Benson et al. \nto useless in predicting the success of black-preferred candidates in contested primary elections; \nbut neither she nor Adelson flagged that distinction for the Commission.  See, e.g., Def.’s Ex. 48 \nat 16-17.)  Bruce Adelson then told the Commission that Handley’s analysis would be “very \ncrucial[,] very important” for the Commission’s map-drawing in those counties.  More to the point, \nAdelson treated those BVAPs as a ceiling, not a floor, in drawing districts in those counties.  \nSpecifically—on September 2, in his capacity as the Commission’s “voting rights act legal \ncounsel”—Adelson told the commissioners that BVAPs higher than Handley’s numbers would \namount to “packing” in violation of the VRA.  He told them on September 2:  \nBut  to  the  point  about  packing,  remember  that  the  [sic]  if  a  district  can  be \nestablished through analysis to be able to elect candidates of choice of the minority \ncommunity at let’s say 40%, if you add on population to that, the courts constitute \nthat as packing.  \n \nMICRC Tr. at 5389. \n \n  Handley’s numbers—plus what Adelson sometimes called a “cushion” of about 5%—\nyielded target BVAPs of 35-40% in Wayne County and about 40-45% (sometimes narrowed to \n42-43%) in Oakland County.  See, e.g., id. at 7230 (“the range for Detroit was 35-40%, Oakland \nCounty was above 40%.”); id. at 7440 (“What Dr. Handley’s racial bloc voting analysis has given \nthe Commission is the benchmarks and the guide rails for each of the Counties that need to be \nadjusted.  [In] Wayne County [it] is 35-40% . . . . And Oakland County is 42, 43%.”); id. at 7495 \n(“Dr. Handley in her analysis referenced Oakland County as having a 40% approximately [sic] \nthreshold, not 35% . . . . 42-43% . . . . That is a good kind of benchmark guidepost.”); id. at 7563 \n(“remember it’s 35-40% in Wayne County.  40-45% in Oakland.”).  And Adelson thereafter told \nthe commissioners, more than 100 times—sometimes directly, sometimes more obliquely—that \nBVAPs in excess of those targets, in districts in those counties, would potentially violate the VRA.  \nSee, e.g., MICRC Tr. at 5810 (“One of the things that I would strongly advise and something that \n56 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 131,  PageID.4760   Filed 12/21/23   Page 57 of\n116\nNo. 1-22-cv-272 \nAgee et al. v.

That her threshold is the 35-40%.  Which is I agree with that.”); id. at 7199 (“I \nthink that I would recommend focusing on the percentages and comparing them to Dr. Handley’s \npercentages for Wayne County which as I recall is 35-40%.”); id. at 7481 (“And it is the Supreme \nCourt has made it very clear that if you pack voters, if voters are put in a District in [ex]cess of \nwhat racial bloc voting analysis shows, that’s an issue.

Admittedly, the \nCommission’s BVAP target ranges were not always perfectly clear as the commissioners and their \ncounsel referred to them throughout the Commission’s work on these districts.  Those targets did \nnot take the form of positive law.  But those references always fell within a BVAP range of 35-\n45%, which tracks Handley’s original numbers plus Adelson’s “cushion.”  And though Detroit’s \npopulation is almost 80% African-American, 12 of the 13 districts at issue here ended up with \nBVAPs between 35.03% and 44.29%.  The only exception is Senate District 11, which has a BVAP \nof 19.19%.  And most of the African-American voters in that district were put there in order to \nlower the BVAP of an adjacent district.

Benson et al. \nb. \n    Subordination of other criteria.  We also find that the Commission subordinated all other \nredistricting criteria to their target BVAPs in Detroit-area districts.  Indeed, commissioners did so \nexpressly. \nFirst, the commissioners subordinated the criterion of “partisan fairness” to hitting their \nBVAP targets in Detroit-area districts.  Partisan fairness ranks fourth in the hierarchy of the \nMichigan redistricting criteria, well after compliance with federal law (and specifically the VRA), \nwhich comes first.  Mich. Const. art. IV, § 6(13).  And (as noted above) the Commission equated \nhitting their BVAP targets with VRA compliance.  Meanwhile, the Commission could not measure \npartisan fairness without a completed draft map (house or senate) for the entire State.  Dr. Handley \nherself told the Commission as much when she presented to the Commission on October 1.  \nMICRC Tr. at 7380 (“And you have to have a complete plan.  This can only be done off a complete \nplan.”).  Thus, partisan fairness is barely mentioned in the Commission’s meetings until October \n6, when the Commission began its first partisan-fairness assessment (of its first completed drafts \nof house and senate maps).   \n  When the Commission did turn to this criterion, they expressly avoided making any \nsubstantial partisan-fairness revisions to the Detroit-area districts, for fear of upsetting their “VRA \ncompliance” (for which, again, hitting the BVAP targets was a proxy).  On October 6, as the \nCommission began its “partisan fairness” assessment, Adelson advised the Commission not to \nmake changes to Detroit-area districts on account of partisan fairness:  \n[M]y suggestion is we avoid districts that have VRA implications.  We have a list \nof  several  other  districts  and  some  other  possibilities.    So  in  the  interest  of \nfacilitating the partisan fairness adjustments our recommendation would be to move \nto districts that are not in the Metro Detroit area.  And address other districts as we \ncan.   \n64 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 131,  PageID.4768   Filed 12/21/23   Page 65 of\n116\nNo. 1-22-cv-272 \nAgee et al. v. Benson et al. \n. . .  \nOur recommendation is we avoid those [Detroit-area districts].  Because adjusting \nin those areas will just make things unnecessarily complicated.  I think that there \nare a lot of areas that potentially we can look at that just don’t implicate these \nconsiderations, thank you. \n \nId. at 7781-82; see also id. at 6189 (“[I]f you can achieve other goals that are lower down on the \nlist of criteria [than VRA], that’s a policy choice for you all.  If they conflict, the Voting Rights \nAct, the 14th amendment win.”); id. at 7167 (“[Y]our legal team agrees that Friday is significant \nin that Dr. Handley will hopefully be able to present partisan fairness.  But it is important and I’m \nsorry I’m going to speak for you.  I will speak in one voice that the legal team strongly believes \nthere are issues in addition of course to the partisan fairness.  There are many voting rights issues \nand  just  in  talking  about  the  packed  districts  in  Wayne  County  .  .  .  .  So  there  are  other \nconsiderations.  Certainly we agree with the partisan fairness and that is significant.  But there are \nother issues.”); id. at 7784, 7785-86, 7904. \nDr. Handley likewise reminded the Commission that, whereas “it’s going to be a balancing \nact between voting rights and partisan fairness,” it is “not an equal balance because the Voting \nRights Act trumps partisan fairness.”  Id. at 7409 (emphasis added); see also id. at 7386 (stating \nwith regard to partisan fairness:  “But especially, again, you have the Voting Rights Act and other \nthings you have to consider.”); id. at 7387 (“Again this is probably a legal question more, but it \nseems to me the [Michigan] Constitution does prioritize for you. And you know what comes first \nand what comes next.”); see also id. at 7382. \nThe Commissioners followed this guidance.

Probably five as well just because \nof how it looks drawn.”); id. at 7785 (Eid: “The reason I didn’t [change these districts is] because \nthey are two VRA districts.”); id. at 7785 (Orton: “We spent so many hours getting those balanced \n65 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 131,  PageID.4769   Filed 12/21/23   Page 66 of\n116\nNo. 1-22-cv-272 \nAgee et al. v.

Indeed, the \ncommissioners frequently expressed their unhappiness about it.  See, e.g., id. at 5747 (Szetela: “I \nappreciate and I did give it some thought but I’m trying to balance the Voting Rights Act against \npreferences because Voting Rights Act is our number one so I’m trying to make sure we don’t get \nconcentrated populations like we have in District nine . . . we received public commentary saying \nthey did not want to be with Grosse Pointe and it’s kind of mixed but doing it this way will us a \nmore balanced from a voting rights and secondary is communities of interest.”); id. at 6429 (Orton: \n“Looking at this overall, I have a comment which I think will be very unpopular.

Because the only \nplaces I see are Hamtramck, Dearborn, Dearborn [H]eights, and the Grosse Points that you know \nshow as not African/American.

Benson et al. \n2. \n   The  Commission  (in  this  litigation)  disputes  that  finding  on  various  grounds.    The \nevidentiary bases, for most of the Commission’s arguments as to racial predominance generally, \nare a modest number of citations to the trial transcripts.  The Commission has little to say about \nthe  10,000-page  contemporary  record  of  its  actions,  or  about  the  voluminous  evidence  of \npredominance catalogued above.  But we address its handful of arguments in turn. \na. \n  The Commission first argues—citing trial testimony that in total runs just over two pages—\nthat “[f]our commissioners attested [at trial] that race did not predominate.”  R.115 at PageID \n4015.  But as an initial matter, the Commission’s chair, Rebecca Szetela, testified before those \nfour commissioners did; and since their testimony refers to hers, we briefly recite some of hers \nfirst.   \nSzetela’s testimony echoed in large part the Commission’s hearing transcripts themselves.  \nAt trial, Szetela testified that—after Dr. Handley provided the Commission with the results of her \nracially polarized voting analysis on September 2—Adelson repeatedly told the commissioners \nthat the “requirement of the law is to avoid packing minorities into districts above and beyond the \npercentage at which analysis is determined they need to elect candidates of choice.”  R.112 at \nPageID 3640; compare, e.g., MICRC Tr. at 5810 (Adelson: “Packing means adding or including \nadditional minority voters typically the ones needed to elect what we call candidates of choice.”). \n Szetela also testified that, “[o]nce we had received that analysis from Lisa Handley it \nbecame all about race . . . . At the direction of Mr. Adelson.”  R.112 at PageID 3652; compare, \ne.g., MICRC Tr. at 7439 (Rothhorn: “I think what we can interpret from [our legal counsel’s] \nadvice is if we don’t try to get to 35%, we have not done our due diligence and therefore we may \n68 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 131,  PageID.4772   Filed 12/21/23   Page 69 of\n116\nNo. 1-22-cv-272 \nAgee et al. v. Benson et al. \nbe exposing ourselves to a legal risk [for a VRA violation] we might be able to defend ourselves \nagainst  but  can’t  guarant[ee]  that.”).    Relatedly,  Szetela  testified  that—with  Adelson’s \nencouragement—the Commission drew districts that stretched into areas where it knew “that white \nvoters” lived.  R.112 at PageID 3646.  She also testified, as to the line-drawing process, “we’re \njust focused on bringing down the black population in Detroit, stretching those districts out into \nthe suburbs surrounding Detroit to add white voters, making the districts thinner and skinnier \nwithin Detroit to reduce black voters and trying to hit those targets of 35 to 40 percent and 45 to \n50 percent.”  Id. at PageID 3651.  That districting strategy was necessary, Szetela testified, \n“[b]ecause the population is just so concentrated that if you pull black people out of one \nneighborhood and move them into another neighborhood in Detroit, it’s just not going to fix the \nproblem because that’s where people live.”  Id. at 3684.  The results of the line-drawing process \nitself support all those assertions.   \nSzetela also testified that, “[a]ny time there was a conflict between a community of interest \nand Voting Rights, the Voting Rights Act prevailed.” Id. at 3663-64; compare, e.g., MICRC Tr. at \n6619-20 (Adelson: “I think that the issues about communities of interest and keeping sort of \ncommunities together as I’ve read a lot of public comments in general . . . . But I think it is very \nimportant from a compliance standpoint to look at the ranked criteria and the number one criteria \nis the U.S. Constitution and Federal law.”); id. at 7242 (Eid: “So, I mean, I’d be welcome to any \nadvice from anybody to figure out a way to not split it up but I think right now what we’ve heard \nis this map is currently not compliant and we need to get it to be compliant.”).  For example, \nSzetela testified that, when the Commission drafted Senate District 8, it “grab[bed] Birmingham, \nwhich is an extraordinarily wealthy [and] white area,” and “pulled [it] into Detroit.”  R.112 at \nPageID 3734; compare, e.g., MICRC Tr. at 7451 (Clark: “When you go into Birmingham, we are \n69 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 131,  PageID.4773   Filed 12/21/23   Page 70 of\n116\nNo. 1-22-cv-272 \nAgee et al. v. Benson et al. \nstretching this all the way from mid-Detroit all the way up there.”  Szetela:  “What other way is it \nto get VRA [compliance]?”).  She likewise testified that, as to Senate District 3, the Commission \ndrew the lines from inner Wayne County to “out farther into Macomb and Oakland counties” to \nadd white voters.  R.112 at PageID 3741-42; compare e.g., MICRC Tr. at 7449 (Szetela: “I think \nit’s good.  I think you brought [the BVAP] down . . . you are right in the sweet spot at this point.”). \nYet Anthony Eid—the first of the four commissioners whose testimony the Commission \nnow cites—disagreed with Szetela’s testimony.  Eid was the Commission’s principal fact witness \nat trial.  In testimony that the Commission now cites, Eid said that “there was no BVAP target and \nwe could not use a target” in the Commission’s map-drawing in Detroit-area districts.  R.104 at \nPageID 2852.  But that assertion is belied not only by hundreds of citations to the contemporary \nrecord cited above, but by Eid’s own statements during the mapping process.  For example, on \nSeptember 30, 2021, alone, Eid said all of the following:   \nWhat is the Black VAP on [draft house district] 21 currently?  Still 64 so it’s still \nhigh, higher than I think we would like it to be. \n \nI hate to split them [i.e., a Grosse Pointe COI] up but I think for this house map I \ndon’t see another way to do it because that is where the white population is around \nDetroit. \n \nMICRC Tr. at 7241-42. \n \nI think the purpose [of some changes Eid had just made to the map] was to shift the \nBlack voting age percentage from District 4 I’m sorry District 6 which was at 67% \nlower.  So now instead of having one District way over on the percent we [ne]ed to \nhit we have two that are close to being around the 45-55% range which I think is \nmore in line with what we need to get than the 68% range it was at before. \n \nId. at 7277. \n \nwhat is the actual target we need to hit.  As you said earlier, we are not going to be \nable to get to 35-40 percent for every one of these Detroit districts I mean I don’t \nsee a way to do it. \n \nId. at 7283.  Similarly, on October 4, Eid said: \n70 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 131,  PageID.4774   Filed 12/21/23   Page 71 of\n116\nNo. 1-22-cv-272 \nAgee et al. v. Benson et al. \nMr. Adelson, I appreciate all of the advice that you give us but I got to be honest \nI’m  becoming  increasingly  uncomfortable  with  this  direction  we’re  going \nunder. . . . But it’s just making me a little uncomfortable having to hit these \npercentages that are low I would be more comfortable with 45% but 35% thank you \nCommissioner Curry.  (Who then says:  “Absolutely I’m in full agreement with \nyou.”). \n \nId. at 7483.  The Commission also cites the following testimony from Eid with regard to \npredominance: \nThis was a multi-factorial and multi-variable process that included many different \nvariables, as we’ve talked about today and will talk about over the next few days, \nand it created a situation where we took a holistic view at all of the variables and \nnot just one.  There was not one issue that predominated over this process. \n \nR.104 at PageID 2845.  Eid’s testimony as to racial predominance, however, was palpably rote \nand rehearsed.  He repeated over a dozen times, for example, that the Commission had “many \nreasons” for its line-drawing decisions in the districts at issue here.  See id. at PageID 2867, 2869, \n2872, 2874, 2876, 2877, 2879, 2882, 2885, 2892, 2895, 2900, 2905, 2912.  All that testimony was \nmore scripted than probative.    \nFinally, though we take no pleasure in mentioning it, cross-examination revealed that—the \nyear before Eid joined the Commission—another public entity had formally sanctioned Eid for \ndishonesty.  Id. at PageID 2943, 2945-47.  And Eid’s testimony before us was by turns implausible \nand evasive.  In demeanor and substance alike, Eid was not a credible witness. \nThe other three commissioners whom the Commission cites now were on the whole \ncredible witnesses.  Commissioner MC Rothhorn, for example, was an open, direct, and engaging \nwitness.  In testimony the Commission cites here—and in response to a question whether “the \nCommission let issues of race dominate this  criteria”—Rothhorn  answered,  “[m]y personal \nmemory is no, and it sure seemed like it when [Szetela’s] testimony was being given, but my \nmemory is no.”  R.112 at PageID 3771.  A few minutes before, however, Rothhorn testified that \n71 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 131,  PageID.4775   Filed 12/21/23   Page 72 of\n116\nNo. 1-22-cv-272 \nAgee et al. v. Benson et al. \nhis memory on this issue was “foggy” and that “[Szetela’s] memory was really great.”  Id. at \nPageID 3766.  And in nearly the same breath Rothhorn testified that, “I think with the first criteria \nbeing population and the Voting Rights Act, it was very important to get that one right first.”  Id.  \nRothhorn also agreed that many of the Commission’s revisions to its maps involved “lowering the \nblack voting age population,” and that the purpose of those revision was “I think to comply with \nthe Voting Rights Act.”  Id. at PageID 3765.  Relatedly, Rothhorn testified that the Commission \nhad used the “spoke” concept in mapping, and that its purpose was to “[m]ove out of the Detroit \narea where the black population is into the suburbs where the white population is.”  Id. at PageID \n3776.    And when asked “[w]ere you ever yelled at for drawing districts in Detroit that had BVAP \nlevels that were too high[,]” Rothhorn answered: \nSo, I certainly appreciate the sentiment.  I don’t—I honestly don’t remember, but I \nremember extreme tension and feelings of—yeah, that feeling of being yelled at \nor—yeah.       \n \nId. at PageID 3772.     \n \nIn the contemporary record, too, Rothhorn regularly discussed the Commission’s BVAP \ntarget.  For example, on one occasion he told a commissioner, “[w]e are currently at 43.25 so you \nwant to try to get it to 35-40” percent BVAP and reminded him that “we are not focusing on” \ncommunities of interest.  MICRC Tr. at 7446-47.  Later, he told another commissioner that in \n“Oakland County the target is 42 to 43ish.”   Id. at 7449.  He also said, “I think what we can \ninterpret from [our legal counsel’s] advice is if we don’t try to get to 35%, we have not done our \ndue diligence and therefore we may be exposing ourselves to a legal risk we might be able to \ndefend ourselves against but can’t guarant[ee] that.”  Id. at 7439.   \nThe Commission also cites the testimony of Juanita Curry.  Specifically—in response to \nthe question whether “the Commission let issues of race dominate in its application of this \n72 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 131,  PageID.4776   Filed 12/21/23   Page 73 of\n116\nNo. 1-22-cv-272 \nAgee et al. v. Benson et al. \ncriteria”—Curry testified that, “[t]o my knowledge, I was not even thinking on that level at all \nthroughout my whole process.  It never dawned on me that we would even do anything like that \nso, no.”  R.112 at PageID 3789.  But Curry’s memory of the Commission’s proceedings was \nperceptibly shaky at trial.  See, e.g., id. at PageID 3784-85.  And during the Commission’s meetings \nthemselves,  for  example,  her  revisions  to  one  district  “took  out  a  lot  of African/American \npopulation.”  MICRC Tr. at 7235.  Yet the BVAP for that district remained high, and she said the \n“only way to go is up north” to reduce it.  Id. at 7239. \nFinally, the Commission cites the testimony of Erin Wagner.  Specifically—in response to \na  question  whether  “the  Commission  allowed  partisan  fairness  to  take  priority  over  other \nconsiderations”—she testified: \nI think, yes, we did—we did do that, but I also think that we just—we were 13 \ncitizens that didn’t know what we were doing, and we were looking to people that \nwere, you know, told—we were told were experts, so of course you’re going to lean \non expert’s opinion.   \n \nR.112 at PageID 3807. \n \nBut Wagner also testified that she had felt like mapping Detroit-area districts was like \nplaying “Blackjack,” explaining:   \nwe were listening to all the people in Detroit and all the African American people \nstate what their communities of interest were, and I was under the assumption, like \n[Rothhorn], that communities of interest was the main thing, but when we were \ngiven the percentages that we had to get down by, we were constantly having to \ndrop those BVAP percentages down. \n \nId. at PageID 3803-04.   \n  The testimony of none of these witnesses remotely displaces any of our findings based on \nthe voluminous record evidence catalogued above. \n73 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 131,  PageID.4777   Filed 12/21/23   Page 74 of\n116\nNo. 1-22-cv-272 \nAgee et al. v. Benson et al. \nb. \n  The Commission also asserts that “[p]olitics better explains the lines” of the districts at \nissue here.  R.115 at PageID 4016.  As support, the Commission invokes not a word from the \ncontemporary  record  of  its  work.    And  the  Commission  concedes  that—unlike  the  racial-\npercentages tool, which the Commission employed on its mapping software from day one—its \npartisan-fairness tool was not activated until early October 2021.  Id. at PageID 4018.  Yet the \nCommission asserts that “the Commission” evaluated “every single” one of its completed maps \nfor partisan fairness as they worked in September.  Id. (alteration omitted).  As support, the \nCommission cites the following testimony from Eid, which reads in full: \nEvery single time we completed a map, before we got our own internal partisan \nfairness tool, I would upload our completed maps into [third-party online] software \nto figure out if we were on the right track or not. \n \nR.104 at PageID 2829.  \n \nWe have no reason to doubt that Eid did as he said—on that point his testimony was \ncredible—but to say on the basis of this testimony that “the Commission” did these evaluations is \nan overstatement.  And meanwhile the commissioners said hardly a word about partisan fairness \nduring their September mapping. \nThe Commission otherwise cites the testimony of one of its expert witnesses, Jonathan \nRodden.  Specifically, quoting Dr. Rodden, the Commission says that, “[b]ecause ‘Democrats in \nMichigan’ are ‘concentrated’ in Detroit, ‘a plan that’s drawn without regards for partisanship will \ngenerate extremely Democratic districts,’ which in turn ‘makes for an inefficient distribution of \nsupport across districts.’”  R.115 at PageID 4017 (citing R.106 at PageID 3120-21).  But the \nevidence afforded by Rodden’s testimony was purely circumstantial:  his point, simply stated, was \n74 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 131,  PageID.4778   Filed 12/21/23   Page 75 of\n116\nNo. 1-22-cv-272 \nAgee et al. v. Benson et al. \nthat the district lines at issue here improved the partisan fairness of the Commission’s maps, and \nthus one might infer that partisan fairness was the object of the Commission’s map-drawing.   \nSo far as the direct evidence of the Commission’s intent was concerned, however, Rodden \nhad nothing to say.  He admitted on cross-examination that he had not “read the transcripts of the \nCommission meetings” or done anything else to learn about the direct evidence available in this \ncase.  R.106 at PageID 3175-76, 3186.  He also admitted that the statements of “the map drawers \nthemselves, can provide critical evidence” of what predominated in their decision-making.  Id. at \nPageID 3188.   More to the point, Rodden said he had testified in another redistricting case—the \nBethune-Hill case that the Supreme Court eventually decided in 2017.  Id. at PageID 3176.  And \nRodden admitted that, in Bethune-Hill, he did review the contemporary record of the map drawers’ \nwork “in painstaking[] detail,” and indeed made that record the basis of his testimony there.  Id. at \nPageID 3180.  But Rodden did none of that work here.  (In fairness to Rodden, he explained that \nthe Commission’s counsel had not asked him to review the contemporary record, which itself \nyields an inference.)  Rodden’s testimony was therefore an abstraction, without any connection to \nthe Commission’s record.  His testimony does nothing to rebut the direct evidence that partisan \nfairness was subordinated to racial line-drawing for the districts at issue here. \nAll that said, the Commission did strive to improve partisan fairness in districts outside the \nDetroit area.  But when the Commission drew Detroit-area (or “VRA”) districts, as shown above, \nit pointedly did not allow considerations of partisan fairness to intrude.  The boundaries of the \ndistricts at issue here—stretching far into Oakland County and even beyond M-59 in Macomb—\ndid improve the 2021 maps’ partisan-fairness scores.  But that was merely a byproduct of the \nCommission’s racial line-drawing.  What improved those scores was the Commission’s decision \nintentionally to distribute African-American voters across a greater number of districts around \n75 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 131,  PageID.4779   Filed 12/21/23   Page 76 of\n116\nNo. 1-22-cv-272 \nAgee et al. v. Benson et al. \nDetroit.  That racial line-drawing reduced Democratic majorities in general elections, leading to \nhigher partisan-fairness scores—to the detriment, plaintiffs say, of their ability to elect their \npreferred candidates in Democratic primaries.  Partisan fairness had little to do with the boundaries \nof the districts at issue here. \nc. \n  The  Commission’s  next  argument  as  to  predominance  is  that  it  “gave  overriding \nconsideration to communities defined by actual shared interests.”  R.115 at PageID 4019-21 \n(internal quotation marks omitted).  As support, the Commission does rely on 18 citations—most \nof them to only a page or two—to the Commission’s meeting transcripts.  Id. at PageID 4020.  \nSeven of those citations are to discussions about communities of interests in areas well outside \nDetroit, including Muskegon County (near Lake Michigan, north of Grand Rapids), Lansing, Ann \nArbor (some 45 miles away from Detroit), and Monroe County (ditto).  See MICRC Tr. at 5514-\n17, 5526, 5559, 5562, 5576-77, 5596-97, 5603.  Those discussions are irrelevant here.   \nThe remaining 11 citations are to discussions among commissioners on a single day—\nnamely September 9, 2021, which was the Commission’s first day of drafting its Detroit-area \nsenate maps.  See id. at 5661-65, 5667-70, 5680, 5683-85, 9986-96, 9999, 10001-02, 10004, \n10008, 10011-13, 10019.  Two of those 11 citations are to discussions about communities of \ninterests that the Commission eventually split up—such as the Downriver community of interest \nwhose fragmentation, four days later, distressed Commissioner Witjes.  Compare id. at 5680 with \n5912; see also id. at 10004.  Those discussions likewise do not support the Commission’s point. \nThat leaves nine citations to different parts of the September 9 transcript.  The Commission \noffers no explanation as to why these discussions (or any of the discussions it cites) support its \nassertion that communities of interest were an “overriding consideration” or even on par with the \n76 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 131,  PageID.4780   Filed 12/21/23   Page 77 of\n116\nNo. 1-22-cv-272 \nAgee et al. v. Benson et al. \nCommission’s BVAP targets as it drafted Detroit-area districts.  Instead we just get the bare cites.  \nNor do we see these discussions as supportive of the Commission’s point.  In two of them, rather, \nAdelson or a commissioner warns the group to be mindful of the districts’ BVAPs.  See id. at \n10008, 10013.  And the remaining seven citations are simply to pages where a commissioner talks \nabout a community of interest.  None of these seven discussions involve talk of any tradeoff \nbetween COIs and the BVAP targets, or between COIs and any other criteria at all.  Moreover, at \nthe end of the mapping process, not a single one of the Commission’s Detroit-area Senate districts \nhad a BVAP exceeding the 35-45% target range.  None of these 18 citations to the meeting \ntranscripts, therefore, undermine our conclusion—based on all the evidence cited above—that the \nCommission subordinated communities of interest to hitting its BVAP targets. \nTwo other points bear mention regarding the Commission’s assertion about “communities \ndefined by actual shared interests.”  At trial, two former state legislators from Detroit—Virgil \nSmith and Lamar Lemmons III—provided a ground-level perspective on what some of these \nDetroit-area districts were like.  In 2022, Smith was the campaign manager for an incumbent state \nsenator, Marshall Bullock of Detroit, who ran in the Democratic primary in the newly drawn \nSenate District 8.  R.102 at PageID 2748.  That district reaches north to include all of Birmingham.  \nAnd in that election white voters rejected Bullock by a margin of 96% to 4%—which allowed their \npreferred candidate, from a Detroit suburb, to win the primary and then the general election.  R.71-\n1 at PageID 1076.  Smith testified about the difficulty that black candidates have campaigning in \npredominantly white suburbs—where, he explained, “the issues [that voters care about] are \ncompletely different.”  R.102 at PageID 2750.  Smith testified that “the more affluent the territory \ngot” as Bullock’s supporters were canvassing,  the less likely it was that voters would answer the \ndoor.  Id. at PageID 2754.  He testified:  “We have a hard time getting them to answer the door for \n77 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 131,  PageID.4781   Filed 12/21/23   Page 78 of\n116\nNo. 1-22-cv-272 \nAgee et al. v. Benson et al. \nus, and if we can’t get them to answer the door for us, how can we sell ourselves as a candidate to \nthe new voters?” Id. at PageID 2750.  And the attitude of some voters, he testified, was that “we \nhave no business being out there.”  Id.  Lemmons testified similarly, saying that he would hire \nwhite canvassers to cover those areas.  Id. at PageID 2773. \nSecond, as a circumstantial matter, that the Commission put cities like Gross Pointe, \nBloomfield Hills, and Birmingham—some of the wealthiest cities in Michigan, where Porsches \nand Range Rovers are commonplace, and Cadillacs more numerous than Chevrolets—in the same \ndistricts as some of the poorest neighborhoods in Detroit, itself belies the idea that “communities \nof interest” were paramount in drawing these districts.  We reject the Commission’s argument on \nthis point also. \nd. \n  More briefly, we likewise reject the Commission’s argument—to which it devotes a single \nparagraph in its brief—that the reason the Commission extended its Detroit-area districts into \nOakland and Macomb County was that the population in Detroit had declined since the 2010 \ncensus.  See R.115 at PageID 4019.  Nowhere in the contemporary record do we see any of the \ncommissioners saying anything to that effect.  Instead, they uniformly said they drew those \n“spokes”—as far north as Bloomfield Hills in Oakland County, and all the way to M-59 in \nMacomb—to reduce the percentages of black voters in those districts.  See, e.g., MICRC Tr. at \n5902, 6157, 6482.  The Commission’s characterizations of its actions in this regard are post hoc. \nIn sum, therefore, we reject the Commission’s contention that it did not adopt racial targets \nthat predominated over other criteria in drawing Detroit-area districts. \n78 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 131,  PageID.4782   Filed 12/21/23   Page 79 of\n116\nNo. 1-22-cv-272 \nAgee et al. v. Benson et al. \ne. \nFinally, in the interest of completeness, we do address one argument that the Commission \nhas not made:  namely, that inclusion of six black-majority districts in its final House Plan (called \n“Hickory”) tends to show that the Commission did not have a 35-45% BVAP target in drawing \nDetroit-area districts.  By way of background (and to reiterate somewhat), the Commission \nreleased its proposed House and Senate plans for public comment on October 11.  See id. at 8164, \n8169.  In both those plans the number of majority-black districts in Detroit stood at zero.  Nine \ndays later, on October 20, the Commission held its public hearing at the TCF Center.  And there—\nnot to put too fine a point on it—the Commission endured a nine-hour pounding from Detroit \nresidents who were distressed, above all, about the proposed absence of any majority-black \ndistricts for their city.   \nA week later, before resuming any of its mapping work, the Commission (at the urging of \nits lawyers) took the extraordinary step of going into a closed session, where everything they said, \nPastula announced, must remain confidential.  During that session, Adelson said that “one of the \nthings we have to stress, emphasize, insist on, plead, beg and say please, please don’t use phrases \nabout adding black people, subtracting black people, adding white people, subtracting white \npeople.”  R.126-1 at PageID 4579.  He then said that “a path forward” for the Commission—\ntoward what, he did not expressly say, but the context, before and after, makes clear enough that \nhe was alluding to raising the BVAPs in some districts—would be to invoke “communities of \ninterest.”  Id. at PageID 4572.  Kellom and Orton understood his point, with Orton saying, “when \nwe’re talking about this, if we choose to put anything together that we currently have separated, \nwe go back to communities of interest.  It’s a community of interest thing, not a VRA thing.”  Id. \nat PageID 4588.  Lett then spoke more directly, saying that the Commission could define \n79 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 131,  PageID.4783   Filed 12/21/23   Page 80 of\n116\nNo. 1-22-cv-272 \nAgee et al. v. Benson et al. \ncommunities of interest however it likes, and so COIs could give the Commission “cover.”  Id. at \nPageID 4603. \nSzetela testified that, before the Commission’s meeting the next day, Rothhorn and Kellom \nspoke to her and said that “they wanted to fix Detroit and they wanted to increase the black voting \nage population and that they had had a discussion with Bruce Adelson that they could do that as \nlong as they used neighborhoods as the basis.”  R.112 at PageID 3718.  (Adelson had many sidebar \ndiscussions with commissioners.  See, e.g., id. at PageID 3767 (Rothhorn); id. at PageID 3611 \n(Szetela)).  Based  in  part  on  what  followed,  we  find  that  testimony  credible.    During  the \nCommission’s meeting on November 2—the first day it worked on its house maps after the TCF \nhearing—Adelson told the commissioners the following: \n[G]oing higher with the BVAP as you’re reuniting the neighborhoods, as we were \ndoing earlier, that is fine under the Michigan Constitution with the criteria number \nthree.  The diverse communities and the communities of interest.  I just wanted to \nmake that clarification. \n \nMICRC Tr. at 9188. \n    \nRothhorn then said that he and Kellom had been working on some “major changes” to the \nhouse maps.  Id. at 9199-9201. Kellom explained that “we are offering this as a way to move \nforward in the Detroit area” and “reunite some of the neighborhoods.”  Id. at 9206-07.  Szetela \nobjected, saying “I don’t remember Commissioner or individual commenters saying that they \nwanted neighborhoods put back together.  I remember a lot of comments about wanting minority \nmajority districts with more than 50% African/American and I don’t remember much of anything \nabout  neighborhoods  honestly.”    Id.  at  9207.    Pastula  interjected:    “I  think  what  I  hear \nCommissioner Kellom discuss is, again, the third criteria of diversity and communities of interest \n. . . [and] the focus of uniting neighborhoods[.]”  Id.  \n80 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 131,  PageID.4784   Filed 12/21/23   Page 81 of\n116\nNo. 1-22-cv-272 \nAgee et al. v. Benson et al. \nThe Commission then moved forward with revisions according to Rothhorn and Kellom’s \nproposal.  Then they checked the BVAPs for the house districts.  That showed two things.  First, \nthat in five House Districts—namely, House Districts 4, 5, 6, 9, 16, and 18 (districts not challenged \nhere), the BVAP rose up above 50%.  Second, that in House Districts 1, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, and 14 \n(which are challenged here), the BVAPs remained relatively stable—and indeed in House Districts \n1, 10, 11, 12, and 14, the BVAPs dropped even further (though still within the 35-45% range).  \nWhen they were done, Adelson said:  “So the numbers to me I think I’m good with them. The I \nthink the numbers are an improvement in the sense of responding to concerns about that I took to \nbe community based. So those are my thoughts.”  Id. at 9256. \nFrom  this  sequence  of  events—beginning  with  the  criticism  the  commissioners  had \nendured at the TCF hearing—one could easily conclude that they invoked “neighborhoods” \n(mentioned 125 times in that day’s meeting) and “communities of interest” (mentioned 99 times) \nas pretexts, or “cover” (as Lett had said), for simply wanting to raise the BVAPs in some house \ndistricts.  (Six of them, as it turned out in the final house plan.)  And thus one could easily conclude \nthat raising those BVAPs amounted to just so much more racial-line drawing.   \nBut  we  need  not  make  that  determination  here.    For  even  if  one  accepts  the \n“neighborhoods” rationale for those changes, that would mean only that the Commission carved \nout an exception—in those six house districts—to the BVAP targets that predominated in the \nCommission’s mapping process for Detroit-area districts generally.  None of the BVAPs in the \nCommission’s Detroit-area senate districts changed materially after the TCF hearing.  Those \ndistricts lines were thus still based on the BVAP targets that predominated before.  The same is \ntrue for the seven house districts at issue here.  It remains true, therefore, that the Commission \n81 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 131,  PageID.4785   Filed 12/21/23   Page 82 of\n116\nNo. 1-22-cv-272 \nAgee et al. v. Benson et al. \ndrew its Detroit-area district lines—including the lines for every house and senate district at issue \nhere—based predominantly on its racial targets.    \n3. \nRacial gerrymandering claims apply “to the boundaries of individual districts.”  Ala. Legis. \nBlack Caucus, 575 U.S. at 262.  Yet what we have already said, in the preceding 81 pages, should \nbe enough to decide this case:  the Commission generally drew its Detroit-area districts based \npredominantly on race, and the districts here were no exception.  But again, in the interest of \ncompleteness (and with apologies for some repetition) we will examine the evidence specific to \neach district at issue here.  That evidence only confirms that race predominated in drawing each \nof these districts.   \na. \n  We begin with Senate Districts 1, 3, 6, 8, 10, and 11.  The Commission drafted those \ndistricts (and others in Detroit) principally on September 9, 13, 14, and 15, 2021, on October 4, \n11, 28, and 29, 2021, and on November 5, 2021.  The Commission adopted the final version of the \nplan—renamed the Linden plan—on December 28, 2021.  As enacted, each district’s black-voter \npercentage (apart from SD11) fell within the range prescribed by Bruce Adelson. \nDistrict    1  3  6  8  10  11 \nNo.  \n  Date  BVAP   BVAP   BVAP  BVAP  BVAP  BVAP \nLinden  12/28/2021  35.03  42.09  39.15  40.25  40.43  19.19 \nPlan \n \n82 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 131,  PageID.4786   Filed 12/21/23   Page 83 of\n116\nNo. 1-22-cv-272 \nAgee et al. v. Benson et al. \n(i) \n  Senate District 1.  This district (which began as Senate District 17) is located entirely in \nWayne County, and has a black-voting age percentage of 35.03.      \n \nAs initially drafted (on September 13), this district ran from Melvindale and River Rouge \n(at its north end) down along the Detroit River through Trenton and Gibraltar (at its south end).  \nSo drafted, its black-voter percentage was 10.98.  But the Commission thereafter looked for other \ndistricts—with lower BVAPs—where it could put black voters to “balance out the population in \nDetroit.”  MICRC Tr. at 5912.  This district was one of them.   \n  Specifically, the Commission removed from this district mostly white neighborhoods \nfurther south (“Downriver”) and added mostly black neighborhoods in central Wayne County \n(including part of Davison-Schoolcraft and Dexter Linwood).  See id. at. 5911-12.  But when it \nfirst did so (on September 15), Commissioner Witjes objected:  \nSzetela: Go down . . . and try to fix that quickly.  By taking off some of the Down \nRiver community.  So we are going to work from the bottom. Go to the Township \nlevel. Commissioner Witjes? \n \n83 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 131,  PageID.4787   Filed 12/21/23   Page 84 of\n116\nNo. 1-22-cv-272 \nAgee et al. v. Benson et al. \nWitjes: Why exactly are we messing with the down river community on the south \nborder based on all the praise that we receive that that’s basically a perfect District \nfrom everyone that lives there.  \n \nSzetela: Because we are going to have to, to balance out the population in Detroit.  \n \nWitjes: I disagree completely.  \n \nSzetela: Okay.  \n \nWitjes: I mean where are you drawing this conclusion from out of curiosity? \nBecause I don’t see it.  \n \nSzetela: From what our voting rights expert indicated our populations were too \npacked.  \n \nId. at 5912.  Those changes and similar ones increased the district’s BVAP from 10.98% to \n34.86%.  Yet on October 4, once the district had taken form, Commissioner Curry complained \nabout its “crazy” and “terrible” shape.  This exchange followed: \nRothhorn:  I  think  the  reason  it’s  drawn  if  my  understanding  is  correct \nCommissioner Curry it’s related to the VRA.  Right where the white and Black \npopulations are balanced so yeah. \n \nCurry: It may be balanced but it looks too crazy. \n \nId.  at  7469.    The  Commission’s  Secretary,  Sarah  Reinhardt,  then  reminded  Curry  that \n“compactness” was the Commission’s “lowest ranked criteria.”  Id. at 7470.  But Curry again \nobjected, this time speaking more generally about how the Commission had “chopped up Detroit.”  \nId. at 7479.  Rothhorn again tried to explain why the Commission had “split Detroit”: \nThe reason I think we are trying to split it is we are trying to get the numbers that \nwe were given from Dr. Handley at 35% with the Black voting age population that \nis 35% so we did our best to try to draw that with that kind of understanding that \nthe Black voting age population can elect a candidate of choice.  I don’t think there \nare any districts even though they may not look like it.  And it looks like it’s \nsplintered.  But there is no District in here with a Black community cannot elect its \ncandidate of choice. \n \n84 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 131,  PageID.4788   Filed 12/21/23   Page 85 of\n116\nNo. 1-22-cv-272 \nAgee et al. v. Benson et al. \nId. at 7480.  When the Commission completed Senate Plan 199 (on October 4), the district that \nbecame Senate District 1 had a black-voter percentage of 36.73.  The Commission thereafter made \nonly minor adjustments to the senate maps; and the enacted version of this district—Senate District \n1—has a black-voter percentage of 35.03.   \n(ii) \nSenate District 3.  This district has a black-voter percentage of 42.09 and encompasses \nparts of Wayne, Oakland, and Macomb County.   \n \nThe district runs from the Detroit River (including Belle Isle) through Hamtramck, all the \nway up to 14 Mile Road—where it combines at its north end parts of Clawson (in Oakland County) \nand parts of Warren (in Macomb County).   \nHere, too, the contemporary record shows that race predominated when the Commission \ndrew this district.  In its initial form, Senate District 3 (which began as Senate District 8) was \nmajority-black, with a BVAP of 50.82%.  But the Commission thereafter deliberately reduced that \nnumber to comport with Adelson’s directive.  On October 4, for instance, while Commissioner \nWeiss was leading the mapping session, he asked: \n85 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 131,  PageID.4789   Filed 12/21/23   Page 86 of\n116\nNo. 1-22-cv-272 \nAgee et al. v. Benson et al. \nWeiss: All right, I guess I’m looking here and are we going to try to do something \nwith [this district]?  \n \nRothhorn: Yes. We are currently at 43.25 [BVAP] so you want to try to get it down \nto 35-40.  \n \nWeiss: Yes, I don’t think my eraser is big enough.  \n. . . . \nSzetela:  Just  for  the  public  listening,  MC  Rothhorn  was  discussing  with \nCommissioner Weiss the populations we are looking at . . . [including what became \nSenate District 3] . . . . And just directing him those are the districts we are trying \nto remedy and bring into compliance.  \n \nWeiss: All right my suggestions from anybody? I guess I need some help on this \none. \n. . .  \nRothhorn:  I can help too.  One of the things I believe that District [] is where again \nwe are not focusing on [communities of interest] so I want to offer this as a way to \n. . . decrease non-Hispanic Black . . . . And increasing our VRA compliance. \n \nId. at 7446-47.  Rothhorn thereafter suggested moving the district slightly north (into what was \nthen Senate District 16).  Commissioner Weiss did so, namely, by “add[ing] a little more of \nClawson”—an Oakland County suburb with a white population over 91%.  Id. at 7448; see \nClawson  city,  Michigan,  U.S.  Census  Bureau, \nhttps://www.census.gov/quickfacts/clawsoncitymichigan (last visited Dec. 21, 2023).  After Weiss \ndid so, Commissioner Lett asked: \nLett: What’s the target for Macomb? Oakland.  \n \nRothhorn: Oakland County the target is 42 to 43ish.  \n \nLett: We are kind of splitting the difference right now.  \n \nSzetela: Yep.  \n \nMICRC Tr. at 7449.  The black-voter percentage dropped accordingly, and Szetela remarked: “I \nthink it’s good.  I think you brought it down so as [Lett] said you are right in the sweet spot at this \npoint.”  Id.   \n86 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 131,  PageID.4790   Filed 12/21/23   Page 87 of\n116\nNo. 1-22-cv-272 \nAgee et al. v. Benson et al. \nThat same afternoon, Rothhorn asked Adelson  to “help” the Commission determine \nwhether this district, with its African-American population, still provided black voters with the \nopportunity to elect their candidates of choice.  He explained:  \n[W]e deliberately tried to unpack [several districts, including what became Senate \nDistrict 3] because those are the highest percentages. And we brought them down \nsignificantly.  And if you would like those numbers, I can give those to you. \n \nId. at 7487.  Adelson agreed, remarking:  \nWe talked about a systematic approach to compliance and that is very important for \nthe record and record keeping in general so I would like to . . . work our way down \nthe list.  \n \nId.  When the Commission got to what became Senate District 3—which at that point had a black-\nvoting percentage of 43.35—Adelson confirmed that “all reveals candidates of choice being \nelected . . . [a]cross the board so I think for now let’s put an okay and go to our next District.”  Id. \nat 7493. \nThe Commission thereafter made only minor adjustments to this district—and the black \nvoting age percentage stayed virtually frozen; as adopted by the Commission, Senate District 3 \nhas a black-voter percentage of 42.09. \n87 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 131,  PageID.4791   Filed 12/21/23   Page 88 of\n116\nNo. 1-22-cv-272 \nAgee et al. v. Benson et al. \n(iii) \n \nSenate  District  6.    This  district  has  a  black-voting  age  population  of  39.15%  and \nencompasses parts of both Wayne and Oakland County.   \n \nThe Commission reached that BVAP in Senate District 6 (which began as Senate District \n9) by moving Southfield (a predominantly black city) into what became Senate District 7 (which \nin an earlier map was Senate District 14).  Simultaneously, it brought Farmington (a predominately \nwhite city) into Senate District 6. \nWhen the Commission began mapping on October 4, the black-voter percentage in this \ndistrict was 51.99:  \nSzetela:  I think you need to take Black population at this point.  What you can do \nby bringing [this district] down. \n. . .  \nOrton: Well from what I think [what became Senate District 6] is overpopulated . . \n. . So . . . we want to reduce the African/American population in [this district] so \nwhat if we took all of Southfield and put it up into [another district] wouldn’t that \npossibility take care of all those problems?  \n \nRothhorn: I think that is what Commissioner Lett was suggesting too. \n \nSzetela: Right.  So you will bring [another district] down [into Southfield] and \nprobably when you do that might have to take [what became Senate District 6] into \nFarmington a little bit.  It’s like you are working at a puzzle here. Shifting things \naround. \n. . .  \n88 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 131,  PageID.4792   Filed 12/21/23   Page 89 of\n116\nNo. 1-22-cv-272 \nAgee et al. v. Benson et al. \nSzetela: Yes, balance [it] out and then you’re going to bring it into Farmington and \nthat will reduce your African/American population. \n. . .  \nEid: And I’ll point out too because [what became Senate District 6] is mostly in \nOakland County we can probably get away with that 43% [BVAP] instead of going \ndown to the 40% number.  \n \nSzetela: That’s true.  \n \nId. at 7452-59.  By removing Southfield (mostly black) and adding Farmington (mostly white), \nthe black-voter percentage fell by over 10%—down to 40.03%.  Later on October 4, Rothhorn \nconfirmed that these adjustments had the desired effect: “Correct so [this District] went from 50 \nto 40.7[%] so that is excellent.”  Id. at 7464.  Commissioner Witjes replied:  \nYep, perfect.  So I think I’m done at this particular point then for rationale these \nadjustments [are] taking into account the Voting Rights Act and looking at the \nvoting age population and the Black voting age population to make them so that  \n. . . the districts are able to elect candidates of choice and by definition . . . we are \ntaking into account diverse population of the State of Michigan.  Erasers down. \n \nId.  At trial, Szetela testified specifically about this district, confirming what the contemporary \nrecord shows:  \nWe reconfigured [this District] to bring it farther over into kind of the Livonia area, \nbring in white voters there, because Southfield has a significant black population \nso we needed to go west on that one to reduce the BVAP.  And so, again, we’re just \nstretching things out into areas where we know that white voters are making these \ndistricts in Detroit skinner, narrower to cut down the black population. \n \n R.112 at PageID 3645-46. \n89 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 131,  PageID.4793   Filed 12/21/23   Page 90 of\n116\nNo. 1-22-cv-272 \nAgee et al. v. Benson et al. \n(iv) \nSenate District 8.  This district has a black-voting age population of 40.25% and crosses \nthe county line between Wayne and Oakland County.   \n \nWhen the Commission first drafted this district (which began as Senate District 13), its \nshape  was  wide—stretching  mostly  east  to  west—and  it  encompassed  large  portions  of \npredominantly black neighborhoods in Southfield and Lathrup Village (both in Oakland County).  \nSo drafted, its black-voter percentage was 63.77.  But on September 15—two days after Pastula \ntold Szetela that she and Adelson were “alarmed” by that number—the Commission reduced the \nblack-voter percentage by narrowing the district and stretching it north to south.  See Pl.’s Ex. 5 at \n45.  That day, Rothhorn explained their “rationale,” saying, “the reason I’m doing this . . .  is to \ndecrease the minority percentage, right, to have a more balanced Black-white ratio and not just \nBlack and white but nonwhite and white balance.”  Id. at 5898.  He further explained: \nI’m comparing it and we reduced it and it’s relatively high and it’s important – what \nI’m thinking about is flagging this in terms of VRA right in terms of the notes that \nwe will follow-up with Bruce on it but this is in terms of, yeah and it’s too high, the \npercentage is too high and want to chip away at it. What I found is trying to improve \n90 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 131,  PageID.4794   Filed 12/21/23   Page 91 of\n116\nNo. 1-22-cv-272 \nAgee et al. v. Benson et al. \nthe percentage of 13. . . .  So moving west. I wasn’t able to improve the minority \npercentage.  \n \nWe have high minority populations in Lathrup Village and Southfield and definitely \nin the Detroit area so [another district] we have to go further north. And so what \nI’m going to do is suggest in [what became Senate District 8] any way we, yeah, I \nguess I’m going to suggest that we have to keep it but I want to get closer to the \npopulation. So I want to take off the northern so I think the southern end we have \nto keep unless other people have ideas. This is where you know again to decrease \nthe minority percentage and increase the white or you know the people of color are \ntoo high at this point.  \n \nId. at 5899.  A few minutes later, however, Lett told Rothhorn, “looking at the percentages on \nvoting whites and Blacks . . . it appears to me there is a lot of work that’s got to be done to get the \npercentages down under 50.”  Id. at 5903.  Rothhorn responded:  \nYeah, so maybe so what I’m hearing you say [Lett] which acknowledges [this \nDistrict] is not good. . . . let’s keep playing because we know this one has to change. \n. . . [this District] is not okay. \n \nId. at 5904.   \nYet at the end of that day’s mapping session, the Commission had reduced the black-voter \npercentage to 59.06—just four points lower than it had been two days before.  Thus, on October \n4, the Commission again sought to reduce that percentage.  They did so by further narrowing its \nshape and driving north into predominantly white suburbs—indeed as far as Birmingham, which \nis 87% white, and whose residents have a median household income of $151,556: \nWitjes: Let’s go – let’s keep going north . . . . Go as far into Birmingham. Anyone \nhave a thought? \n \nSzetela: I’m sorry could you repeat that.  \n \nWitjes: [This District] extending north into Birmingham.  \n \nSzetela: Why not. We got to get the VRA right and that is number one so.  \n \nMr. Morgan: Birmingham not Troy?  \n \n91 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 131,  PageID.4795   Filed 12/21/23   Page 92 of\n116\nNo. 1-22-cv-272 \nAgee et al. v. Benson et al. \nClark: When you go into Birmingham, we are stretching this thing all the way from \nmid-Detroit all the way up there.  \n \nSzetela: What other way is it to get VRA.  \n \nCurry: That is okay. You can do that.  \n \nClark: I know we can do it.  \n \nId.  at  7450-51;  see  also  Birmingham  city,  Michigan,  U.S.  Census  Bureau, \nhttps://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/birminghamcitymichigan/PST045222  (last  visited \nDec. 21, 2023). \nThat change reduced the black-voter percentage significantly, from almost 60% down to \n48%.  See MICRC Tr. at 7452 (Witjes: “So . . . 48% Black voting age population so it’s going \ndown.”).  But it also increased the district’s overall voting-age population, making it overpopulated \n(for purposes of achieving “equal population” in all districts) by roughly 36,000 people.  Id.  \nCommissioner Witjes therefore suggested a solution—namely, to remove “piece[s]” of Detroit, so \nthat both the total voter-percentage and the black-voter percentage decreased simultaneously.  See \nMICRC Tr. at 7452-53.  Those changes had the desired effect:  \nWitjes:  And what was the percentage that [this District] should go down.  \n \nRothhorn:  Started 57.32 now we are 44.13 nice work.  \n \nWitjes: What does it need to go down to? \n \nSzetela:  Wayne is 40 ideally.  35-40%.  \n \nId. at 7453.  By the end of the day on October 4, the Commission had reduced the black-voter \npercentage slightly more, to 42.45%.  And after October 4, the Commission made only minor \nchanges  to  the  district;  as  enacted,  Senate  District  8  has  black-voter  percentage  of  40.25.  \nCommissioner Szetela explained at trial what the contemporary record shows:  \n92 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 131,  PageID.4796   Filed 12/21/23   Page 93 of\n116\nNo. 1-22-cv-272 \nAgee et al. v. Benson et al. \n[This District] was originally entirely up in Oakland County with just a very small \namount in Detroit.  We’ve now brought it down, almost half of it into Detroit. . . . \nAnd so, again, we’re just stretching things out into areas where we know white \nvoters are making these districts in Detroit skinnier, narrower to cut down the black \npopulation. \n \nR.112 at PageID 3645-46. \n(v) \nSenate District 10.  This district encompasses parts of Wayne and Macomb County and \nhas a black-voter percentage of 40.43.  Its shape is irregular, running north to south—from roughly \n19 Mile Road down to 8 Mile Road—where its southernmost portion hooks east into Wayne \nCounty. \n \nOn October 4, this district (which began as Senate District 6) had a black-voter percentage \nof 49.38.  As a result, Szetela identified this district as one where “we [] still have some VRA work \nto do[.]”  MICRC Tr. at 7438.  Rothhorn agreed, reminding the group to keep Dr. Handley’s \nracially polarized voting analysis in mind: \nIt might help Commissioners if you are looking at Lisa Handley’s presentation Page \n20 the map that shows the State House districts and the State Senate districts for \n93 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 131,  PageID.4797   Filed 12/21/23   Page 94 of\n116\nNo. 1-22-cv-272 \nAgee et al. v. Benson et al. \nthe 2010 maps what she shows on that Page 20 is the areas that are packed and what \nshe describes as the most packed is 50% to 70% meaning if we are in 50%, we are \nnot unpacked [] and if we are 40%, we have not unpacked it.   \n \nThe map shows where we should target.  All those districts [including what became \nSenate District 10] are all in the area if we are 50% range it’s just as packed as it \nwas in 2010.  That’s kind of the map I’m reading here. \n \nId.   \nCommissioner  Vallette  then  led  the  mapping  session  during  which  the  Commission \nmodified this district’s boundaries.  To reduce the black-voting age percentage, Vallette narrowed \nthe district and extended its northern edge further into Macomb County—all the way up into \nSterling Heights and past 19 Mile Road.  Id. at 7443.  Those changes reduced the BVAP to a “hair \nover 40%”; but (as with Senate District 8) they also caused an increase in the district’s overall \nvoting age population, making it overpopulated by roughly 7,000 people.  Id. at 7445.  Szetela \nnoted, however, that the district as amended had “accomplished” VRA compliance and that—\nthough still slightly overpopulated—it fell “within” an appropriate “deviation.”  Id.  But then Orton \nsuggested a simple solution: \nOrton:  [I]f you took some . . . more of the higher Black population [in this District] \n. . . and put it [another district] that’s going to decrease the population over all and \nit will make [the BVAP] under 40% probably. \n \nId.  Vallette thereafter moved a predominantly black precinct “south of 8 mile” into the district \nadjacent (which became Senate District 11).  As a result, both the total voter-percentage and the \nblack-voter percentage decreased: \nVallette: I think I’m good.  \n \nRothhorn: Yes you are.  \n. . . . \nSzetela: Brought your African/American below 40%.  So now you are perfectly in \nthe sweet spot of 35-40.  All right. \n \n94 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 131,  PageID.4798   Filed 12/21/23   Page 95 of\n116\nNo. 1-22-cv-272 \nAgee et al. v. Benson et al. \nId. at 7446.  Senate District 10 thereafter changed only slightly; in the map completed on October \n4, its black-voter percentage was 41.2.  As enacted in the Linden plan, that number is 40.43.   \n(vi) \n  Senate District 11.  This district (which began as Senate District 5) has a black-voter \npercentage of 19.19 and is located almost entirely in Macomb County.  \n \nIts shape is long and narrow, stretching from just south of 8 Mile Road (in Wayne County) \nall the way past 24 Mile Road in Macomb Township.  As the Commission did with Senate District \n1, it looked for other districts to add black voters to “balance out” Detroit.  MICRC Tr. at 5912.  \nThis district was one of them.  As Szetela testified at trial: “So, again, we’re trying to reduce black \npopulation [in other districts] and that requires us to grab more white population, and that also \nshifts some of the black population into a district where there’s very little black population.  So we \n[took] Eastpoint[e] . . . which is predominantly black, [out of Senate District 10], and we put it \ninto a mostly white district [Senate District 11].”  R.112 at PageID 3737.  And when asked,  “So \nif you’re black and you live in Eastpoint[e], why did the Commission put you in an 80 percent \n95 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 131,  PageID.4799   Filed 12/21/23   Page 96 of\n116\nNo. 1-22-cv-272 \nAgee et al. v. Benson et al. \nwhite district[,]”  Szetela answered: “[b]ecause we had to reduce the black voting population in \nthe district adjacent to it.”  Id. at PageID 3739. \nThe contemporary record confirms the accuracy of Szetela’s testimony.  For example, on \nOctober 4, Commissioner Vallette “[took] the top tier from Eastpointe” out of what became Senate \nDistrict 10 and put it into what became Senate District 11—which, Rothhorn observed, “reduced” \nthe BVAP in Senate District 10 “from 47.3 to 45.8 so you are definitely heading in the right \ndirection.”  MICRC Tr. at 7442; see also id. (“Okay so at this point you have most of Eastpointe \n[in what became Senate District 11].”); id. at 7443 (“Again Janice for context you started 47.83 \nnon-Hispanic Black age population [in what became Senate District 10] so you are definitely \nworking in the right direction.”). \nThus, the Commission moved a substantial number of voters into this district based on their \nrace.  And as enacted in the Linden plan, the black-voter percentage in Senate District 11 is 19.19.  \nb. \n \nWe next consider House Districts 1, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12 and 14.  The Commission drafted those \ndistricts (and others in Detroit) principally on September 20, 21, 22, 29, and 30, 2021, on October \n5, and 8, 2021, and on November 2, 3, 4, and 5, 2021.  The Commission adopted the final version \nof its house plan—the Hickory plan—on December 28, 2021.  As enacted, each district’s black-\nvoter percentage fell within the range prescribed by Bruce Adelson. \nDistrict    1  7  8  10  11  12  14 \nNo.  \n  Date  BVAP   BVAP   BVAP  BVAP  BVAP  BVAP  BVAP \nHickory  12/28/2021  38.03  44.29  43.70  38.79  42.82  40.99  41.11 \nPlan \n \n96 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 131,  PageID.4800   Filed 12/21/23   Page 97 of\n116\nNo. 1-22-cv-272 \nAgee et al. v. Benson et al. \n(i) \nHouse District 1.  This district has a black-voter percentage of 38.03.  \n \n  On September 30—the day that Pastula advised the Commission to review its draft districts \none-by-one to ensure that their BVAPs fell in the range specified by Dr. Handley’s report—the \nCommission skipped over House District 1 because, at that point, its black-voter percentage was \nonly 36.58.  See id. at 7226-39.   \n  When the Commission sought to revise the house districts for “VRA compliance” (on \nOctober 5), Weiss said that House District 1 “looks good.”  Id. at 7639.   But he also noticed that \nan adjacent district—which became House District 2—was “a little high”, so suggested the \nCommission “maybe . . . swap some stuff out here[.]”  Id.  Szetela soon asked, “Just to be clear \nyou’re trying to increase the African/American population in one and reduce it in two is that what \nI’m understanding you’re trying to do?”  Id. at 7641.  Weiss replied: “Yes at least that’s what I’m \nthinking.    Any  suggestions  Chairperson?”    Id.    Szetela  then  suggested  that,  based  on  her \n“familiar[ity]” with Detroit, “if you take population from two up at the top and put it into one, \n97 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 131,  PageID.4801   Filed 12/21/23   Page 98 of\n116\nNo. 1-22-cv-272 \nAgee et al. v. Benson et al. \nyou’re adding more African/American into one . . . . [s]o that might enable you to balance it[.]”  \nId. at 7641.  Weiss thereafter did so, and the black-voter percentage rose to nearly 40.  Id. at 7642 \n(“now we are 39.9”). \nThe  Commission  thereafter  used  the  bellwether-election  tool  to  confirm  that  black \ncandidates could still elect their candidate of choice (in general elections, given its limitations); \nand unsurprisingly, it showed that black candidates of choice (Democrats) won in landslides.  See \nid. at 7649 (“District 1 is for the election results as configured now 87 for Biden, 13 for Trump, \n91 for Clinton, 9 for Trump, Obama 94, Romney 6 . . . .”).  Adelson utilized this as a teaching \nmoment, to again remind the Commissioners about the dangers of “packing”: \nElection results are all uniform and play out and indicate this is a [district] that \nperforms where minority candidates of choice can be elected but going back a little \nbit to my discussion [from earlier] . . . . Here this is a district where the margins are \nvery strong.  So rhetorically if you were going to add additional minority population \nhere, wouldn’t that be packing? That’s not necessary to elect candidates of choice. \nThat’s the key metric.   \n \nSo the margins were close like 50.1 to 49.9, yeah, I think that that would make \nsense.  But when you have margins like this, the difficulty is in justifying it why \ndid you do that? What would be constitutional rationale?  If you will so that is part \nof seeing in real time since the election results all play out strongly, that’s the \nVoting Rights Act metric, ability to elect. \n \nId.  at 7649-50.   \nThe black-voter percentage thereafter stayed remarkably stable; as enacted in the Hickory \nPlan, House District 1 has black-voter percentage of 38.03. \n98 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 131,  PageID.4802   Filed 12/21/23   Page 99 of\n116\nNo. 1-22-cv-272 \nAgee et al. v. Benson et al. \n(ii) \nHouse District 7.  This district has a black-voter percentage of 44.29.  It is long and narrow, \nstretching from Davison-Schoolcraft (in Wayne County) through Royal Oak (in Oakland County) \nup to 12 Mile Road. \n \nWhen the Commission began mapping on September 30, the district that became House \nDistrict 7 had a black-voter percentage of over 75—and Adelson therefore identified it as a \n“serious  district[]”  that  “has[s]  significantly  more  [black]  population  than  Dr.  Handley \nrecommended in her analysis.”  Id. at 7223.  Rothhorn confirmed as much a few minutes later, \nsaying, “I think I heard [what became House District 7] for example is one that needs to be fixed.”  \nId. at 7224.  So did Curry:  “I think . . .  Bruce said that it was [the district that became House \nDistrict 7] . . . [that was] over packed and maybe we could look [at it].”  Id. at 7231.  Pastula \nsuggested that the Commission “scroll” down the list and identify “anything that is higher than \n99 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 131,  PageID.4803   Filed 12/21/23   Page 100 of\n116\nNo. 1-22-cv-272 \nAgee et al. v. Benson et al. \n40% for the Black voting age population”; she also noted that House District 7 was one she \n“anticipate[d]” the Commission would fix.  Id. at 7226.  A few minutes later, Pastula again told \nthe Commission to look at the district that became House District 7 (among others) to see how the \nblack-voter percentage “can be minimized.”  Id. at 7229; see also id. at 7243 (Pastula) (“The data \nfor [what became House District 7] is . . . 76.72 Black VAP [which] would be considered a packed \nDistrict so what we were trying to do is utilizing the racial bloc voting, which the Commission \nwith the percentage by which the minority voting population would have the opportunity to elect \ncandidates of choice . . . . so I hope that was helpful in what the goal is.”).   \nSzetela thereafter suggested that the Commission start there: “So [this district] is definitely \nthe highest,” it “has 76% African/American. . . . We can certainly start with [what became House \nDistrict 7].”  Id. at 7232.  As Curry began to lead the mapping session, Rothhorn gave her a \nreminder:  \nRothhorn: I think our goal Commissioner Curry is to reduce [the BVAP].  \nCurry: 40, 45.  \n \nRothhorn: Correct, yep. \n \nId. at 7234.   Curry thereafter made several adjustments, one of which was to “put[] some of the \nAfrican/American population from Detroit” into an adjacent district.  Id. at 7234.  Curry then asked \n“so we need to get rid of about how many more, unpack how many more?”  Id. at 7325.   Rothhorn \nexplained that, consistent with the “spoke concept,” the Commission would need to draw the \ndistrict further north: “[S]o we have taken away the Black population now add a white population \nin order to significantly reduce [the BVAP] and it looks like based on” the black-voter “theme” “it \nneeds to be north to Berk[ley] and I don’t know what you think about as far as Berk[ley] being \nable to fit with this District and I think that is part of what we are struggling with.”  Id. at 7236. \n100 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 131,  PageID.4804   Filed 12/21/23   Page 101 of\n116\nNo. 1-22-cv-272 \nAgee et al. v. Benson et al. \n  Curry then made some additional adjustments whose specifics are unclear from the record, \nbut in any event the BVAP went down as result.  Rothhorn confirmed:  “Going to watch the \nnumbers for the . . . Black voting age population so we reduced it by 13% .”  Id. at 7239.  Rothhorn \nthen added, in apparent frustration how the district was drawn, “Mr. Adelson is asking us to \nexperiment and don’t want to sacrifice people’s lives in the way they want their districts drawn \nbut we do need to try it.”  Id.  By the end of the day on September 30, the district that became \nHouse District 7 had a black-voter percentage of 66.54. \n  On October 5, the Commission shifted what became House District 7 further east, thereby \nreducing the black-voter percentage substantially, to 39.85.  In November, however, the BVAP for \nthis district increased slightly.  Clark said that a higher BVAP for this district “would further \nsupport what I heard at the TCF center of having more higher percentage African/American \npopulation that they have today so I think that would help what I heard at TCF.”  Id. at 9416.  As \napproved in the Hickory Plan, House District 7 has a black-voter percentage of 44.29.  \n(iii) \nHouse District 8.  This district has a black-voter percentage of 43.7.  It is long and narrow, \nrunning from Midtown Detroit (in Wayne County) through Madison Heights (in Oakland County) \nand up to 14 Mile Road.   \n101 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 131,  PageID.4805   Filed 12/21/23   Page 102 of\n116\nNo. 1-22-cv-272 \nAgee et al. v. Benson et al. \n \nOn September 30, Adelson advised specifically that House District 8, which at that time \nhad a black-voter percentage of 53.85 and was far more compact, was “still a little on the high \nside,” so he suggested “go[ing] back and see if we can make some further refinements.”  Id. at \n7282.  But Eid was apparently confused, so he asked Kellom (who was leading the mapping \nsession) for clarification, saying, “We are saying eight is still on the high side being at 53.85%?”  \nId.  That led to the following exchange: \nKellom:  So Commissioner Eid I was getting mixed messages I heard what Bruce \nsaid about that. And because I thought that 53 was high.  But he said it’s not that \nhigh considering so I was going to stop my turn.  But then we got more hands so \nI’m going to stop talking and I want a specific direction in terms of what to do.  \n \nAdelson:  Commissioner Kellom, I don’t want you to use the term direction but I \nwill say I wish you and I continued our collaboration with District eight to further \nour compliance refinement.  And that the population that we will need to adjust \nfrom 8, that will you know obviously affect the connected districts.  But I think that \n102 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 131,  PageID.4806   Filed 12/21/23   Page 103 of\n116\nNo. 1-22-cv-272 \nAgee et al. v. Benson et al. \n– my recommendation is you and I continue with eight to see how we can further \nimprove the population[.] \n. . . . \nRothhorn:  I think through the actions of Mr. Adelson and Kellom they will try to \nexperiment to see if they can get it lower. \n. . . . \nAdelson:  But 53.85% yes, it’s an improvement.  Yes, it is moving in the right \ndirection.  But my feeling is that there is more to be done here.  Because I am just \n[loth] to say creating 54, 55, 56%  majority minority districts in an area that analysis \nis determined, Black voters can elect at percentages lower.  I’m not prepared to do \nthat.  So the axiom that Commissioner Rothhorn with all due respect kind of said \nin my head is try.  There is still more trying to do.  We are not at the end of the line \nyet. \n \nId. at 7283-84.  Kellom thereafter continued to reduce the black-voter population, during which \nAdelson suggested “there may be places to adjust to the north . . . . Which I think . . . does not have \na significant BVAP population so that is just the suggestion [as] another place to look for \nadjustments.”  Id. at 7284.  Kellom did so, drawing the district further north in Oakland County \n(namely, into Royal Oak and Madison Heights); that “adjustment” reduced the black-voter \npercentage from 54 to 50, which Adelson said was “a big improvement.”  Id. at 7285, 7287. \nOn October 5, while the Commission worked on other house districts south and west of \nHouse District 8 to ensure compliance, it “[a]ccidentally” “balanced” the black-voter percentage \nin House District 8—namely, by reducing it further, to 35.71.  Id. at 7648 (Rothhorn: “I think you \nmay have balanced 8 it was 53.9[.]”).  The Commission thereafter reviewed this district with \nAdelson, and Clark asked: “So eight is another this is going to be in Wayne County and Macomb \nCounty I believe yeah so [what] are [we] focusing towards here?  Wayne, we said 35 to 40% \nMacomb had nothing [and] we are currently at 35.71 . . . so if we raised it to 40, I think we will be \nokay.” Id. at 7657.  Adelson replied: “Commissioner Clark and particularly if you are moving \npopulation from Wayne County areas, I think that is the zone to look for[.]”  Id.  He added, \nhowever, that “this District is underpopulated [as a whole] so there is some room to grow here.”  \n103 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 131,  PageID.4807   Filed 12/21/23   Page 104 of\n116\nNo. 1-22-cv-272 \nAgee et al. v. Benson et al. \nId.  Commissioner Clark thereafter “put the Black population on the screen” and suggested \n“add[ing]” from what became House District 14 “into” House District 8.  That change slightly \nincreased the black-voter percentage in House District 8, to 37.98.  Id.  Szetela then asked Adelson:  \nSzetela:  8 with 37.98 and we have ten with 42.53 so I mean we could try to balance them \nmore but they are still both going to be about 40 is that acceptable? \n \nAdelson: Is that mainly in Wayne County?  \n. . . . \nSzetela: Eight I would say is more in Oakland County.  \n  \nClark: Eight goes a little further north than Oakland . . . . \n \nSzetela: Eight does come all the way down so yeah, I would say they are 50/50. . . . \n \nAdelson: [W]e can see if there are some additional judgments to make with the aim of \nhitting Dr. Handley’s marks and then we can look at the elections. \n \nId. at 7658.  Commissioner Clark then “move[d] some” non-black population into what became \nHouse District 10 to “increase” the black voter-percentage in House District 8.  Id.  \nIn November, however, the Commission noticed that House District 8 was overpopulated.  \nSee id. at 9406 (Rothhorn: “The District that has the most to give is House District 8.”).  But \nSzetela reminded the group that House District 8 is an “Oakland County VRA district where we \nare trying to keep it above 40.”  Id.  Accordingly, the Commission increased House District 8’s \nblack-voter population slightly by removing white portions of Madison Heights in Oakland \nCounty.  See id. at 9410 (Kellom:  “sorry I was just double checking the African/American \npopulation in Madison Heights and it’s 8.51% so yes that is fine”); id. (Rothhorn: “Black voting \npopulation increased with that change.  And may reflect what our fellow Detroiters were asking \nfor. . . . And yeah, I think we are going to go with that.”).  As finally approved, the black-voter \npercentage in House District 8 is 43.70. \n104 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 131,  PageID.4808   Filed 12/21/23   Page 105 of\n116\nNo. 1-22-cv-272 \nAgee et al. v.

This district has a black-voter percentage of 38.79.   \n \n  The Commission began drafting House District 10 (which began as House District 4) on \nSeptember 21.  Clark immediately noted that, since “[w]e’ve got a large portion of Detroit left  \n. . . . We are going to end up with an African/American population that is going to be pretty \nsignificant.”  Id. at 6410.  Szetela recommended that they draw a “spoke” which (she said) would \ncreate more “balance[].”  Id.  But Clark responded that it made little sense to group together “that \neastern part of Detroit” with Grosse Pointe, which has the “majority of the money.”  Id. at 6411.   \nSzetela  reminded  Clark  that  “that  VRA  is  first  on  our  list.    And  so  we  have  to  look  at \naccommodating VRA first.  And if that requires [uniting those neighborhoods] to do it, I think that \nis where we need to look first.”  Id.  The Commission thereafter modified several other districts, \nand by September 28 the black-voter percentage for this district was 42.74.   Yet on September 30, \nthe Commission adjusted several districts south and west of House District 10, and in doing so \nincreased the black-voter percentage to 58—which was “substantially more out of the range than \nwe wanted.”  Id. at 7277 (Orton: “Okay, so before you did this . . . the voting age Black population \nin District 4 was 41.2% which is quite a bit closer to the target that we are going for.  Now it’s a \nlot higher . . . . I thought we were going 35-40% so [it is] way out from what I’m thinking.”). \n105 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 131,  PageID.4809   Filed 12/21/23   Page 106 of\n116\nNo. 1-22-cv-272 \nAgee et al. v. Benson et al. \n  Thus, on October 5, the Commission stretched this District farther north to reduce its black-\nvoter percentage.  As Witjes explained, “I would imagine we would have to go north, correct? We \ngot to take away some too.”  Id. at 7642.  The Commission thereafter narrowed the lower half of \nthis district, and then extended its reach up to the Wayne-Macomb County border, which reduced \nthe black-voter percentage substantially—all the way to 40%.  See id. at 7643 (Szetela:  “Brought \nit down quite a bit.”).  Witjes then asked Adelson: “as District Four is below 40%.  And 40% sweet \nspot still apply?”  Adelson replied: “As we talked about yesterday, I think providing some leeway, \na little cushion here I think that is important.”  Id. at 7644.  The Commission then made a few \nmore adjustments, which (by the end of that day’s mapping session) increased this District’s BVAP \nto 42.68%. \n  The Commission thereafter made only minor adjustments in November, which decreased \nthe black-voter percentage further, to 38.79. \n(v) \nHouse District 11.  This district has a black-voter percentage of 42.82.  \n106 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 131,  PageID.4810   Filed 12/21/23   Page 107 of\n116\nNo. 1-22-cv-272 \nAgee et al. v. Benson et al. \n \nWhen the Commission began mapping on September 30, House District 11 (which began \nas House District 6) had a black-voter percentage of over 65.66.  Adelson therefore identified it as \na  “serious  district”  that  “ha[s]  significantly”  more  black  “population  than  Dr.  Handley \nrecommended in her analysis.”  Id. at 7223.  Pastula thereafter advised the Commission to “start \nagain with the list at District 1 and look at [] the Black VAP, if it’s above that 40% particularly in \nthe Metro Detroit area how that can be minimized and I know from the chart . . . it’s also [what \nbecame House District 11].”  Id. at 7229.  Szetela then noted that what became House District 11 \n“definitely” had one of the “highest” black-voter populations.  Id. at 7232.  The Commission \nthereafter began adjusting other districts, but Eid suggested “go[ing] to” what became House \nDistrict 11, since it was “64%” BVAP.  Id. at 7241.  Accordingly, the Commission added to this \nDistrict a significant portion of Grosse Pointe Woods (to the north), and removed a portion of \nHarper Woods (to the south), which brought this district’s BVAP “significantly lower.”  Id. at \n107 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 131,  PageID.4811   Filed 12/21/23   Page 108 of\n116\nNo. 1-22-cv-272 \nAgee et al. v. Benson et al. \n7241, 7277.  By the end of the day on September 30, the Commission had adjusted the black-voter \npercentage down to 49.23. \nOn October 5, the Commission again identified each house district with black-voter \npercentages higher than 40-45, and thereafter sought to reduce those percentages.  See, e.g., id.  at  \n7639.  In what became House District 11, the Commission accomplished that goal by again \n“expand[ing] [the district] north” further into Macomb County, as far as St. Clair Shores.  Id. at \n7644; id. at 7643 (Szetela: “With . . .[what became House District 11] we have room to go north” \nbecause it “kind of lead[s] out of Detroit.”); id. at 7644 (Witjes: “now [what became House District \n11] needs to expand north”).  Those changes and others reduced this district’s BVAP a little more, \nto 47.37.  See id. at 7665 (Szetela:  “What about taking a little bit of St. Clair shoes that western \nedge . . . isn’t that primarily white along there.  Add a little more white to bring down your \nAfrican/American?”). \nIn November, the Commission modified the district again by adding more white population \nin Macomb County, thereby reducing the black-voter population to 42.82—where it remained \nwhen the Commission adopted the Hickory Plan in December. \n108 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 131,  PageID.4812   Filed 12/21/23   Page 109 of\n116\nNo. 1-22-cv-272 \nAgee et al. v. Benson et al. \n(vi) \nHouse District 12.  This district has a black-voter percentage of 40.99. \n \nThroughout the mapping process, the black-voter percentage in House District 12 (which \nbegan as House District 11) remained right around 43.  On October 5, however, the Commission \nmodified several adjacent districts, and the BVAP in what became House District 12 exceeded \n50%.  See id. at 7663 (Rothhorn: “the Black voting age population [in what became House District \n12 was] 51.58 and went up to 61 so we are back down again”).  Thus, the Commission sought to \nreduce it—specifically, by extending the district farther north to include more white population.  \nId. at 7664 (Lett:  “The only thing I’m trying to do right now is get the percentage down on [what \nbecame House District 12].”); id. (Orton:  “Well I’m thinking if you just add a little bit more into” \nthe district adjacent “since it is [] a little bit under populated, that’s taking African/American \npopulation out [so] that will help the number [what became House District 12], I think.”); id. at \n7665 (Clark: “That is the concept move more white into [this District].”).  Those adjustments and \n109 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 131,  PageID.4813   Filed 12/21/23   Page 110 of\n116\nNo. 1-22-cv-272 \nAgee et al. v. Benson et al. \nothers, which Adelson remarked moved “the numbers . . . in a positive direction” reduced the black \nvoter percentage to 49.89, which Szetela noted was still “a hair high.”  Id. at 7666.  \nIn  November—after  Adelson’s  admonition  at  the  closed  session  meeting—the \nCommission modified what became House District 12 by extending it even farther north, through \nRoseville and up to 13 Mile Road in Macomb County.  The Commission ostensibly aimed in part \nto keep the “Roseville community together,” in its effort to “mend some of these neighborhoods.”  \nId. at 8773.  The Commission also excised portions of House District 12’s southern end in Wayne \nCounty.  Those changes together reduced the black voter percentage down to 40.99. \n(vii) \nHouse District 14.  This district has a black-voter percentage of 41.11 and encompasses \nparts of Wayne and Macomb County. \n \nThroughout September and October, House District 14 (which began as House District 10) \nextended from the western half of Warren (in Macomb County) all the way down to just north of \nEastern Market in Detroit (in Wayne County).  For much of that time, this district’s BVAP \n110 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 131,  PageID.4814   Filed 12/21/23   Page 111 of\n116\nNo. 1-22-cv-272 \nAgee et al. v. Benson et al. \nremained just below 40.  But on October 5, that number increased slightly because the Commission \nreduced the black-voter population in districts to the east and south.  See, e.g., id. at 7643 (Orton:  \n“It seems like [what became House District 14 is] now really high.”); id. (Witjes:  “That [increase] \nhappened because of how we are adjusting.”).  The Commission thereafter sought to bring the \nBVAP for this district back down.  See id. at 7657 (Clark:  “Okay so [what became House District \n14] is overpopulated so let’s take a look at the border of 8 and [what became House District 14] \nand let’s see if we can move some Black population.  We may impact [what became House District \n14] by doing that percentage wise.”); id. at 7658 (Clark:  “Go to the top and Madison Heights and \nmove some from eight into [what became House District 14] . . . . And that will bring non-Black \npopulation into [what became House District 14] which should reduce it a little.”).  After the \nCommission made a few more changes that reduced this District’s BVAP further, Adelson \napproved: “I think the percentages there has been some positive movement . . . with the percentages \nbut that is my only offhand thought.”  Id. at 7660.  By the end of the day on October 5, the black-\nvoter percentage in what became House District 14 was 42.8.   \nIn November, however, the Commission modified the district when it incorporated the \n“draft overlay” map proposed by Rothhorn and Kellom.  Rothhorn nevertheless reminded the \nCommission that what became House District 14 was “one of those VRA districts.”  Id. at 9410.  \nAs enacted in the Hickory Plan, House District 14 has a black-voter percentage of 41.11. \nc. \n  Based on all the evidence cited above—including both the Commission’s race-based \ntargets in drafting the Detroit area, and the district-specific evidence just described—we conclude \n111 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 131,  PageID.4815   Filed 12/21/23   Page 112 of\n116\nNo. 1-22-cv-272 \nAgee et al. v. Benson et al. \nthat  the boundaries of all the districts at issue here were drawn predominantly on the basis of race.  \nIndeed the record before us permits no other conclusion. \nB. \nWe make shorter work of the Commission’s backup argument that its race-based line-\ndrawing can survive strict scrutiny.  Plaintiffs have shown that the lines for their districts were \ndrawn predominantly on the basis of race, which means those districts “cannot be upheld unless \nthey are narrowly tailored to achieving a compelling state interest.”  Wis. Legis., 595 U.S. at 401 \n(quoting Miller, 515 U.S. at 904).  The Supreme Court has assumed, without deciding, that \ncompliance with the VRA can be a compelling interest that supports drawing districts along racial \nlines.  Id.  To that end, the Commission first asserts that, in the 2011 plan, Detroit-area districts \nhad been “packed” in potential violation of the VRA.  (Notably, no Detroit voters themselves ever \nchose to challenge the districts.)  And the Commission argues that it had “good reasons to think” \nthat Section 2 of the VRA itself required the Commission to reduce the BVAPs of plaintiffs’ \ndistricts to between 35-45%.   See Cooper, 581 U.S. at 293.   \nThat argument is meritless.  The Commission repeats to us what Adelson so often told the \ncommissioners:  that BVAPs above 35-45% in these districts would amount to “packing” African-\nAmerican voters in violation of the VRA.  The Supreme Court recognized the possibility of \npacking claims in Thornburg v. Gingles, when it said that a state could violate § 2 by concentrating \nblack voters “into districts where they constitute an excessive majority.”  478 U.S. 30, 46 n.11 \n(1986).  In the 37 years since, however, the Court has yet to hold that any district violated § 2 on \ngrounds of packing.  \nThe Commission had little reason to think these districts could be the first.  Begin with \nwhat the Supreme Court actually said in Thornburg:  that an “excessive majority” of black voters \n112 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 131,  PageID.4816   Filed 12/21/23   Page 113 of\n116\nNo. 1-22-cv-272 \nAgee et al. v. Benson et al. \ncould amount to packing in violation of the VRA.  Id. (emphasis added).  Yet here the racial targets \nlimited these plaintiffs to a political minority in their districts.  True, in one case—30 years ago—\nthe plaintiffs argued that the VRA required the state to change a majority-minority district to a \nminority-minority one.  But the Supreme Court did not recognize that as a valid theory under § 2 \nthen—it decided the case on other grounds—and it has not done so since.  Voinovich v. Quilter, \n507 U.S. 146, 154 (1993).  Moreover, in every case where the Supreme Court has found vote \ndilution in violation of § 2, it ordered the creation of a majority-minority (e.g., majority-black) \ndistrict—rather  than  a  minority-minority  one,  which  is  what  (per  Adelson’s  advice)  the \nCommission confined itself to here.  And the Commission’s theory would make the BVAP floor \nnecessary for “opportunity” districts under the VRA also a BVAP ceiling in those same districts.  \nSee MICRC Tr. at 5810-12.  The Supreme Court has never said anything like that.  \n Thus, the Commission’s theory of potential liability, at best, is highly speculative.  And \nspeculative reasons are not “good reasons for thinking that the [VRA] demanded” the racial line-\ndrawing employed here.  Wis. Legis., 595 U.S. at 404 (emphasis in original; internal quotation \nmarks omitted).  \nNor did the Commission have anywhere near an adequate basis for the factual premise of \nits theory:  namely, that black voters could in fact elect their preferred candidates at the BVAP \nlevels prescribed for the districts here.  Everyone agrees that the elections in these districts are \ndecided in the Democratic primaries, not the general election.  Yet Handley’s analysis lacked any \nprimary-election  data  that  was  relevant  to  whether  black  voters  could  elect  their  preferred \ncandidates at these BVAP levels.  Even Adelson admitted as much.  And Handley herself admitted \nto Szetela, at the eleventh hour, that “we simply do not know” how black-preferred candidates \nwould fare in Democratic primaries.  Yet these experts told the commissioners again and again—\n113 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 131,  PageID.4817   Filed 12/21/23   Page 114 of\n116\nNo. 1-22-cv-272 \nAgee et al. v. Benson et al. \nbased on general-election data alone—that black-preferred candidates would “perform well” in \nthese districts.  That was a grave disservice to everyone involved with this case, above all the \nvoters themselves.   \nAll the districts in this case were drawn in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the \nU.S. Constitution.  Finally, given that holding, we need not reach plaintiffs’ § 2 claim under the \nVRA. \n*  *  * \n  We enjoin the Secretary of State from holding further elections in these districts as they \nare currently drawn.  And we will direct that the parties appear before this court in early January \nto discuss how to proceed with redrawing them. \n  IT IS SO ORDERED. \nDate:  December 21, 2023  /s/ Raymond M.

Benson et al. \nNEFF, District Judge, concurring in the result. \nAlthough the majority reaches the correct result, I write separately because I believe the \nopinion is unnecessarily harsh to the Commission, Bruce Adelson, and Lisa Handley.   \n“Redistricting is never easy,” Abbott v. Perez, 138 S. Ct. 2305, 2314 (2018), and is \ngenerally accomplished behind closed doors, either by legislators or the courts so there is no way \nto watch it being done.  In 2018, the people of Michigan overwhelmingly voted to open the doors \nand take the politicians out of the redistricting process with the ultimate goal of creating more fair \nmaps.  To that end, the Michigan Independent Redistricting Commission—comprised of thirteen \nrandomly selected lay citizens—is now entrusted with making the reapportionment decisions in \nMichigan.  The process is conducted in full view of the public, the media, and any interested group \nor individual.  The majority opinion makes that point throughout, quoting extensively from the \n10,000+ page transcript of the Commission’s work and uses the commissioners’ own words to \nestablish that the process was fatally flawed. \nThe thirteen civic-minded commissioners had a difficult job with scant preparation and \nnearly no experience in the reapportionment process.  A difficult task became nearly impossible \nfor the Commission when the pandemic hit in 2020.  The Michigan Constitution required the \nCommission to publish proposed redistricting plans no later than September 17, 2021, and to adopt \nfinal plans by November 1, 2021.  Mich. Const. art. IV, §§ 6(7) and 6(14)(b).  The pandemic \ncaused a six-month delay in the census data, and the Commission did not start map-drawing until \nmid-August 2021.   \nCommissioner Erin Wagner succinctly described the difficulty facing the commissioners, \n“we were 13 citizens that didn’t know what we were doing, and so we were looking to people that \n. . . we were told were experts, so of course you’re going to lean on an expert’s opinion.” (ECF \nNo. 112 at PageID.3807.)  The Commission’s experts—Mr. Adelson and Dr. Handley—are highly \n115 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00272-PLM-RMK-JTN   ECF No. 131,  PageID.4819   Filed 12/21/23   Page 116 of\n116\nNo. 1-22-cv-272 \nAgee et al. v. Benson et al. \nrespected in the redistricting field.  Dr. Handley is one of the leading experts and has testified about \nredistricting and voting rights in numerous courts across the nation.  Here, she provided her racial \nbloc analysis but readily admitted that she did not have the most probative primary elections results \nuntil very late in the process.  (ECF No. 106 at PageID.3219.)  Mr. Adelson also has an extensive \nresume,  including  acting  as  the  Voting  Rights  Act  counsel  for  the  Arizona  Independent \nRedistricting Commission in 2011.   \nIn the face of such a daunting task, the extensive quotes of the Commission’s work reflected \nall the best that could be expected: they took the work seriously, they worked hard to learn the job, \nthey cooperated and collaborated, and they wanted to do the job well and right.  Any suggestion \notherwise  does  a  disservice  to  the  men  and  women  who  undertook  a  very  difficult  and \nunprecedented task.  There was no history to follow or learn from and no role model to lead the \nway and to set a standard. \nI do not believe that there was any ill intention by any individual in this case.  In many \nrespects, the adopted maps may have accomplished the ultimate goal of being more “fair.”  \nPrevious maps commonly divided districts based on lines of historical segregation.  (See ECF No. \n102 at PageID.2653.) Were these old districts drawn predominately based on race or for another \nlegitimate reason? We  will never know because everything happened  behind closed doors.  \nEverything is public now.  And the unique circumstances of this reapportionment process led to \nan extensive record of race predominating in the line drawing of certain districts.  This finding, \nhowever, should not take away from the fact that the Commission worked extensively hard \nthroughout this extremely difficult process to do what it thought was right.  \n \n \n \n116 \n ",
