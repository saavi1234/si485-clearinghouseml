    "summary": "<p>On October 26, 2017, three individuals from New Orleans, represented by private counsel, filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against Uber Technologies, Inc. and its subsidiary, Rasier LLC (Collectively, &ldquo;Uber&rdquo;). The plaintiffs alleged that Uber violated its legal obligations under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), the California Disabled Persons Act (CDPA), and California&rsquo;s Unfair Competition Law (UCL) by failing to provide wheelchair-accessible rides through the Uber app. The complaint also included a theory that Uber was a &ldquo;place of public accommodation&rdquo; because it had organized a concert at a secret location that was accessible only by Uber. The case was originally assigned to District Judge Maxine M. Chesney, but shortly thereafter the case was related to a similar lawsuit (<a href=\"../../../../case/43465/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Crawford v. Uber Technologies, Inc.</a>) and reassigned to District Judge Richard Seeborg, who was presiding over the Crawford case.</p>\r\n<p>Uber moved to compel the New Orleans Plaintiffs to arbitration on January 23, 2018. They argued that the plaintiffs couldn&rsquo;t show they had been injured because they hadn&rsquo;t actually downloaded the Uber app and so lacked standing under Title III of the ADA. They further argued that, if Plaintiffs did have standing, they should be prevented from avoiding the arbitration agreement in the Uber app&rsquo;s terms and conditions under a theory of equitable estoppel&mdash;essentially that the plaintiffs couldn&rsquo;t seek to benefit from an agreement while refusing to abide by its terms. One of the three New Orleans Plaintiffs had actually downloaded the Uber app.</p>\r\n<p>On April 13, 2018, Judge Seeborg granted Uber&rsquo;s motion with respect to that Plaintiff but denied it with respect to the other Plaintiff because Uber&rsquo;s argument was based on contract law, and Plaintiffs sought to enforce the ADA against Uber, not the terms and conditions agreement. 315 F. Supp. 3d 1124.</p>\r\n<p>With their claims surviving, the plaintiffs amended their complaint on May 8, 2018 &nbsp;to remove the California state law claims (in response to a ruling in the Crawford case). Uber initiated an appeal to the ruling on the motion to compel arbitration on May 16, 2018 and filed a motion to dismiss the plaintiffs&rsquo; first amended complaint on May 22, 2018. In the motion, Uber argued that the plaintiffs never formally requested the modification they are seeking, a requirement under the ADA. Uber also disputed that it was a place of public accommodation under the ADA simply because it had organized a concert.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On July 17, 2018 the plaintiffs agreed to consolidate their fact discovery with the Crawford case&rsquo;s, but each set of plaintiffs continued to file motions separately and remained docketed separately.</p>\r\n<p>On October 3, 2018, Judge Seeborg granted Uber&rsquo;s motion to dismiss with respect to the plaintiffs&rsquo; public accommodation theory&mdash;holding that the concert venue was the public accommodation, not Uber&mdash;and with respect to the &ldquo;formal request&rdquo; requirement. The complaint survived on the auxiliary aid and removal of barriers provisions of the ADA, and the plaintiffs were given leave to amend their complaint to properly allege that they had requested that Uber modify its service. The plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint on October 11, 2018. 2018 WL 7200717.</p>\r\n<p>The parties jointly proposed orders to stay the proceedings for 12 months on October 30, 2018, which Judge Seeborg granted on November 5. On October 24, 2019, the Jackson Plaintiffs and Uber jointly proposed an order to stay their proceedings for an additional 6 months, which the court granted the following day.</p>\r\n<p>On December 17, 2019, Uber filed a motion to dismiss the New Orleans Plaintiffs&rsquo; second amended complaint. They argued that the Plaintiffs lacked a private right of action under Title III because they didn&rsquo;t allege they were being presently discriminated against (since they had never downloaded the Uber app). They also argued that Plaintiffs&rsquo; requested modifications were unreasonable and that Plaintiffs didn&rsquo;t allege any facts to suggest they were denied auxiliary aids and that the complaint didn&rsquo;t implicate any failure to remove barriers.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Judge Seeborg denied in part and granted in part the motion to dismiss on March 12, 2020. He held that the ADA provides a right of action to anyone who has reasonable grounds to believe a person is &ldquo;about to be&rdquo; subjected to discrimination on the basis of disability, which does not require the Plaintiffs to be active users of the Uber app. He granted Uber&rsquo;s motion with regard to the auxiliary aid and removal of barriers theories, holding that those provisions did not apply to individuals with mobility impairments. 444 F. Supp. 3d 1136.</p>\r\n<p>On May 14, 2020, Uber&rsquo;s appeal of the District Court&rsquo;s ruling on the motion to compel arbitration was argued in the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit before Circuit Judges J. Clifford Wallace and Ryan D. Nelson as well as District Judge Frederic Block of the Eastern District of New York sitting by designation. On August 24, 2020, in a decision authored by Judge Nelson, the Ninth Circuit affirmed the District Court&rsquo;s ruling. The Court held that the plaintiffs did not need to go through the motions of a &ldquo;futile gesture&rdquo; to obtain standing under the ADA and that the terms and conditions did not apply because the plaintiffs were never party to that contractual agreement. 971 F.3d 1088.</p>\r\n<p>For the remainder of the case, the New Orleans and Jackson Plaintiffs generally filed identical motions but the cases remained docketed separately. Uber in turn filed separate, identical motions in each case. The court&rsquo;s orders addressed both sets of plaintiffs together but appeared in both dockets.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The remainder of this case&rsquo;s summary can be found in the <a href=\"../../../../case/43465/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Crawford v. Uber Technologies, Inc. entry</a> on the clearinghouse.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

INTRODUCTION \ns ri\net\ntatDis 16    Stephen Namisnak and Francis Falls bring this action against Uber Technologies, Inc. and \n Sn \ndr\nee 17  its subsidiary Rasier, LLC for failure to make reasonable accommodations under federal disability \nth\nnirt\nUo\nN 18  law. The case was stayed for a year while the parties attempted mediation. Defendants now move \n19  to dismiss the Second Amended Complaint (“SAC”), arguing plaintiffs have no private right of \n20  action, have not been denied reasonable modifications, and have otherwise failed to state a claim. \n21  Pursuant to Civil Local Rule 7-1(b), the motion is suitable for disposition without oral argument, \n22  and the hearing set for April 2, 2020 is vacated. For the reasons set forth below, the motion to \n23  dismiss is granted in part and denied in part. \n24  II.  BACKGROUND \n25  Uber operates a ride-for-hire service that utilizes a mobile phone application (“app”) to \n26  connect riders with drivers who have signed up with the app. The Uber app offers users services \n27  which vary from locality to locality. In some cities, such as Portland, San Francisco, Los Angeles, \n28  and Washington, D.C., the app displays an icon called “Uber Access.” When a user taps on the \n\nCase 3:17-cv-06124-RS   Document 102   Filed 03/13/20   Page 2 of 12\n \n1  icon, two options appear: “UberASSIST” and “UberWAV.” UberASSIST connects app users with \n2  specially trained drivers who will assist riders into vehicles and can accommodate folding \n3  wheelchairs, walkers, and scooters. UberWAV offers app users the option to call a wheelchair-\n4  accessible vehicle, i.e. a “WAV.” \n5  Plaintiffs are persons with disabilities who live in New Orleans. Falls has paraplegia as the \n6  result of a spiral cord injury and is missing his right arm. Namisnak has muscular dystrophy. Both \n7  use electric wheelchairs for mobility. These wheelchairs cannot be folded or stored in the trunk of \n8  a car, because they are too heavy. Because plaintiffs cannot drive, they use public transportation to \n9  get around. Since the Uber app in New Orleans does not provide UberWAV, plaintiffs are unable \n10  to use the service.1 Accordingly, plaintiffs allege, Uber has violated its obligations under the \n11  Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”). \n12  Plaintiffs have never downloaded the Uber app because they are aware UberWAV is not \na \nrt ni\nouor 13  offered, and their electric wheelchairs do not fit into standard cars. If Uber were to offer in New \nCif\nt al\ncC 14  Orleans a service, such as UberWAV, which accommodated electronic wheelchairs, plaintiffs \ni\nstrof \nDict  15  would use it. They seek declaratory and injunctive relief under Title III of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. § \ns ri\net\ntatDis 16  12181 et seq. \n Sn \ndr\nee 17  III.  LEGAL STANDARD \nth\nnirt\nUo\nN 18    Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) governs motions to dismiss for failure to state a \n19  claim. A complaint must contain a short and plain statement of the claim showing the pleader is \n20  entitled to relief. Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a). While “detailed factual allegations” are not required, a \n21  complaint must have sufficient factual allegations to “state a claim to relief that is plausible on its \n22  face.” Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (quoting Bell Atlantic v. Twombly, 550 U.S. \n23  544, 570 (2007)). A Rule 12(b)(6) motion tests the legal sufficiency of the claims alleged in the \n24  complaint. See Parks Sch. of Bus., Inc. v. Symington, 51 F.3d 1480, 1484 (9th Cir. 1995). Thus, \n25 \n \n26  1 UberASSIST is also unavailable in New Orleans. However, plaintiffs allege they could not use \nUberASSIST, even if it were an option, because that service does not accommodate non-folding, \n27  electric wheelchairs. \n28  ORDER \nCASE NO.  17-cv-06124-RS \n2 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-06124-RS   Document 102   Filed 03/13/20   Page 3 of 12\n \n1  dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) may be based on either the “lack of a cognizable legal theory” or on \n2  “the absence of sufficient facts alleged” under a cognizable legal theory. UMG Recordings, Inc. v. \n3  Shelter Capital Partners LLC, 718 F.3d 1006, 1014 (9th Cir. 2013). When evaluating such a \n4  motion, courts generally “accept all factual allegations in the complaint as true and construe the \n5  pleadings in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.” Knievel v. ESPN, 393 F.3d 1068, \n6  1072 (9th Cir. 2005). However, “[t]hreadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action, \n7  supported by mere conclusory statements, do not suffice.” Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678. \n8  IV.  DISCUSSION \n9  A.  Private Right of Action \n10  Title III of the ADA authorizes suits by two classes of private persons: (i) “any person who \n11  is being subjected to discrimination on the basis of disability in violation of [Title III]” and (ii) \n12  “any person…who has reasonable grounds for believing that such person is about to be subjected \na \nrt ni\nouor 13  to discrimination in violation of section 12183 of this title.” 42 U.S.C. § 12188(a)(1) (emphasis \nCif\nt al\ncC 14  added). In other words, any person who has been or is being subjected to discrimination on the \ni\nstrof \nDict  15  basis of disability may sue under any provision of Title III, but a person who is “about to be \ns ri\net\ntatDis 16  subjected” to discrimination may only sue for discrimination under section 12183, which concerns \n Sn \ndr\nee 17  the design, construction or alteration of commercial facilities. Id.  \nth\nnirt\nUo\nN 18  Here, plaintiffs allege that they have been and are being subjected to discrimination2 \n19  because they are denied access to Uber’s service for routine activities, such as attending doctor’s \n20  appointments or civic engagement events, and running errands. They have not downloaded or \n21  attempted to use the Uber app because they have “personal knowledge” that UberWAV is not \n22  available in New Orleans and “chose not to engage in a process they know to be futile with Uber.” \n23  SAC at 30. Defendants argue plaintiffs do not have a private right of action because their \n24  allegations cannot establish that they have experienced discrimination if they have not downloaded \n25 \n \n26  2 The parties agree that allegations plaintiffs are “about to be subjected” to discrimination would \nnot be sufficient in this case, as plaintiffs are not suing for discrimination concerning the design, \n27  construction, or alteration of commercial facilities, as provided under section 12183. \n28  ORDER \nCASE NO.  17-cv-06124-RS \n3 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-06124-RS   Document 102   Filed 03/13/20   Page 4 of 12\n \n1  the app. Plaintiffs contend it would be pointless “to bump their wheelchairs into inaccessible Uber \n2  vehicles.” Plaintiffs’ Memorandum in Opposition, ECF No. 100, at 11.  \n3  A person with a disability is not required to “engage in a futile gesture if such person has \n4  actual notice that a person or organization covered by this subchapter does not intend to comply \n5  with its provisions.” 42 U.S.C. § 12188(a)(1). Under Ninth Circuit precedent, plaintiffs suing \n6  under Title III are not required to engage in a “futile gesture” in order to show actual injury under \n7  the ADA. See Pickern v. Holiday Quality Foods Inc., 293 F.3d 1133, 1136–37 (9th Cir. 2002). \n8  The Ninth Circuit has explicitly rejected the requirement that ADA plaintiffs “personally \n9  encounter” barriers in order to sue. See Civil Rights Educ. & Enf’t Ctr. v. Hosp. Props. Trust, 867 \n10  F.3d 1093, 1099 (9th Cir. 2017) (“It is the plaintiff’s ‘actual knowledge’ of a barrier, rather than \n11  the sources of that knowledge, that is determinative.”). This principle was discussed thoroughly in \n12  several recent cases in which Uber was a defendant. Crawford v. Uber Techs., Inc., No. 17-cv-\na \nrt ni\nouor 13  02664, 2018 WL 1116725, at *2 (N.D. Cal. Mar. 1, 2018); O’Hanlon v. Uber Techs., Inc., No. 19-\nCif\nt al\ncC 14  cv-00675, 2019 WL 5895425, at *5 (W.D. Pa. Nov. 12, 2019) (“[A]n individual’s standing to \ni\nstrof \nDict  15  bring a claim for disability discrimination under the ADA is not dependent on his/her undertaking \ns ri\net\ntatDis 16  futile gestures…such plaintiffs have their own standing; their deterrence-based injury is actual, \n Sn \ndr\nee 17  cognizable and their own.”); Access Living of Metro. Chicago v. Uber Techs., Inc., 351 F. Supp. \nth\nnirt\nUo\nN 18  3d 1141, 1150 (N.D. Ill. 2018) (“Garcia and Cooper did not have to download the app and request \n19  an Uber ride to be injured. They saw the app, learned of the lack of wheelchair-accessible rides, \n20  and want to use the app in the future but reasonably believe they cannot. That is sufficient.”); \n21  Ramos v. Uber Techs., Inc., No. 14-cv-00502, 2015 WL 758087, at *7 (W.D. Tx. Feb. 20, 2015) \n22  (“[A]n ADA plaintiff need not request services as long as they have actual notice that they would \n23  be denied services or treated in a discriminatory manner and they are being deterred from \n24  attempting to obtain the services by such knowledge.”). \n25  Plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged past and present discrimination; they need not engage in \n26  the “futile gesture” of downloading the Uber app to confirm they cannot use it. Namisnak and \n27  Falls have pled actual knowledge that the Uber app in New Orleans does not have a mechanism \n28  ORDER \nCASE NO.  17-cv-06124-RS \n4 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-06124-RS   Document 102   Filed 03/13/20   Page 5 of 12\n \n1  for summoning a WAV vehicle. They have stated they “want to use Uber’s transportation system, \n2  but have been deterred because they know that if they tried, they would not be able to call a \n3  WAV.” SAC at 9, 22, 28–30. They have also pled that “they plan to use Uber if and when it \n4  becomes accessible for persons with motorized wheelchairs in New Orleans.” Id. at 10. At the \n5  pleading stage, plaintiffs are not required to do more than they already have in order to \n6  demonstrate past and present discrimination.   \n7  B.  Failure to Provide Reasonable Modifications \n8  Defendants also argue plaintiffs have failed to allege plausibly they were denied \n9  “reasonable modifications” as defined by Title III of the ADA. Section 12184 of Title III prohibits \n10  discrimination “on the basis of disability in the full and equal enjoyment of specified public \n11  transportation services.” 42 U.S.C. § 12184(a). Under this section, discrimination includes, inter \n12  alia, failure to make reasonable modifications consistent with section 12182(b)(2)(A)(ii). Id. § \na \nrt ni\nouor 13  12184(b)(2)(A). To prevail under section 12182(b)(2)(A)(ii), the plaintiff must show the defendant \nCif\nt al\ncC 14  failed to make a “requested reasonable modification…necessary to accommodate the plaintiff’s \ni\nstrof \nDict  15  disability.” Karczewski v. DCH Mission Valley LLC, 862 F.3d 1006, 1010 (9th Cir. 2017) (quoting \ns ri\net\ntatDis 16  Fortyune v. Am. Multi-Cinema, Inc., 364 F.3d 1075, 1082 (9th Cir. 2004)).  \n Sn \ndr\nee 17  Plaintiffs here contend they requested reasonable modifications in a September 2018 letter. \nth\nnirt\nUo\nN 18  See Exhibit E, SAC, ECF No. 92-5. In that letter, they asked Uber to “utilize its resources, internal \n19  knowledge, and business know-how to change its operational policies and provide WAV service \n20  in New Orleans.” Id. The letter further communicated plaintiffs’ expectation that Uber would, \n21  within seven days of receiving it, “begin providing WAV service in New Orleans” and “ensure \n22  that a fleet of approximately 30–60 WAV vehicles are available in New Orleans” such that “any \n23  UberWAV service Uber provides in New Orleans meet the equivalency standard of 49 C.F.R. § \n24  37.105.” Id. The letter conceded that plaintiffs “cannot tell Uber how it must change its internal \n25  business practices and operations to provide WAV service in New Orleans,” because “[t]he ADA \n26  does not require [plaintiffs]…to tell Uber how to run its business.” Id. After a year-long stay in \n27  this case, Uber responded to the letter in November 2019, explaining its belief that Uber has no \n28  ORDER \nCASE NO.  17-cv-06124-RS \n5 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-06124-RS   Document 102   Filed 03/13/20   Page 6 of 12\n \n1  affirmative obligation to provide accessible rides, but it is nevertheless “voluntarily” \n2  experimenting with UberWAV in “pilot markets.” See Exhibit A, Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss, \n3  ECF No. 98-1.3 Instead of making plaintiffs’ requested modifications, the response letter referred \n4  them to five alternative WAV service providers in the New Orleans area. Id. Uber still does not \n5  provide UberWAV in New Orleans. \n6  Plaintiffs must demonstrate both that they requested modifications, and that those requests \n7  were reasonable. In Karczewski v. DCH Mission Valley, 862 F.3d at 1006, the Ninth Circuit held a \n8  requested modification could not be deemed unreasonable for purposes of a motion to dismiss \n9  because, at this stage, a plaintiff’s plausible allegations must be credited as true, id. at 1011. \n10  Plaintiffs in Karczewski were requesting a car dealership install hand controls in some of its \n11  vehicles so mobility-limited potential buyers could test drive them. Id. at 1008. Defendants \n12  identified several potential challenges which, they argued, made the requested modification \na \nrt ni\nouor 13  difficult, expensive, and unreasonable to implement. Id. at 1011. The Ninth Circuit found that, \nCif\nt al\ncC 14  even if plaintiffs’ request was revealed to be unreasonable at the summary judgment stage, it could \ni\nstrof \nDict  15  not be deemed so at the motion to dismiss stage because the necessary facts had yet to be \ns ri\net\ntatDis 16  developed. Id. (citing Fortyune, 364 F.3d at 1083 (“[W]hether a particular modification is \n Sn \ndr\nee 17  ‘reasonable’ involves a fact-specific, case-by-case inquiry that considers, among other factors, the \nth\nnirt\nUo\nN 18  effectiveness of the modification in light of the nature of the disability in question and the cost to \n19  the organization that would implement it.”)). \n20  Similarly, in the present case, plaintiffs’ plausible allegations, taken as true, establish their \n21  requested modifications are not unreasonable. Plaintiffs have presented evidence that Uber \n22  provides UberWAV services in other cities, using UberWAV fleets larger than what they \n23  requested in New Orleans. They have pled that Uber can modify its app to provide additional \n24 \n \n25  3 Uber’s response letter is attached to the SAC. Matters outside the pleadings are usually \ninadmissible for the purposes of deciding a Rule 12(b)(6) motion. Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(d). However, \n26  because the response letter’s authenticity is not contested, and because the SAC “necessarily \nrelies” on it—the back-and-forth letters form the basis for plaintiffs’ “reasonable modification” \n27  theory—it may be considered. Lee v. City of Los Angeles, 250 F.3d 668, 688 (9th Cir. 2001). \n28  ORDER \nCASE NO.  17-cv-06124-RS \n6 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-06124-RS   Document 102   Filed 03/13/20   Page 7 of 12\n \n1  services—as it has done with UberPUPPIES and UberDONUTS—in far less time than the almost \n2  three years since this case was filed. Furthermore, they have pled that Uber contracted with \n3  companies in some cities, and paid them support fees, in order to provide UberWAV in those \n4  markets. In other cities, Uber has advertised directly to drivers and incentivized them to provide \n5  UberWAV service. While the reasonableness of plaintiffs’ requested modifications may be \n6  challenged at a later stage, for purposes of a motion to dismiss, their allegations are plausible and \n7  must be taken as true. They establish Uber could reasonably assemble a fleet of WAVs in New \n8  Orleans and modify its app to provide UberWAV. \n9  In Uber’s response letter, the company referred plaintiffs to other WAV providers in New \n10  Orleans. Defendants argue this response was reasonable as a matter of law. A covered entity may \n11  refer a disabled individual to another entity when the individual seeks “services outside of the \n12  referring [entity]’s area of specialization.” 28 C.F.R. § 36.302(b)(1). The regulation provides an \na \nrt ni\nouor 13  example: a doctor who specializes in a certain practice area may refer a disabled patient seeking \nCif\nt al\ncC 14  treatment in another practice area to a doctor who specializes thereto without running afoul of the \ni\nstrof \nDict  15  ADA, if the referring doctor would do the same for a non-disabled patient. 28 C.F.R. § \ns ri\net\ntatDis 16  36.302(b)(2). That is, for example, a cardiologist can refer a disabled patient with a broken arm to \n Sn \ndr\nee 17  an orthopedist, just as she would a non-disabled patient. Defendants, however, refer plaintiffs to \nth\nnirt\nUo\nN 18  other transportation providers not because they would do the same for non-disabled riders, but \n19  because they simply do not want to accept the logistical and financial cost of serving them. A \n20  cardiologist may not send a disabled patient with a heart murmur to an orthopedist, and Uber \n21  cannot refer plaintiffs to other transportation companies. Put differently, Uber’s claim that it is \n22  “not a transportation company” strains credulity, given the company advertises itself as a \n23  “transportation system.” See SAC at 7–8. Plaintiffs are simply asking Uber to provide a service \n24  similar or identical to one it already provides: UberWAV. UberWAV cannot, by definition, lie \n25  outside the company’s “area of specialization.” \n26  Moreover, defendants’ fixation on their alleged non-obligation to provide “equivalent \n27 \n28  ORDER \nCASE NO.  17-cv-06124-RS \n7 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-06124-RS   Document 102   Filed 03/13/20   Page 8 of 12\n \n1  service” is misplaced.4 Sections 12184(b)(3) and (b)(5) of Title III provide that vehicles purchased \n2  or leased for “specific public transportation” systems must be “readily accessible to or usable by \n3  individuals with disabilities, including individuals who use wheelchairs,” unless the provider “can \n4  demonstrate that the [transportation] system…when viewed in its entirety, provides a level of \n5  service…equivalent to the level of service provided to the general public.” 42 U.S.C. § \n6  12184(b)(3); 42 U.S.C. § 12184(b)(5); 49 C.F.R. § 37.103. Defendants point out they do not \n7  themselves purchase or lease vehicles, and thus argue the “equivalent service” requirement does \n8  not apply to them. However, they have “not pointed to anything suggesting that an entity must \n9  own or lease vehicles to be subject to section 12184.” Access Living, 351 F. Supp. at 1159. Their \n10  citations to Toomer v. City Cab, 443 F.3d 1191, 1195 (10th Cir. 2006), and Noel v. New York City \n11  Taxi & Limousine Comm’n, 687 F.3d 63, 65 (2d Cir. 2012), are misguided; not only are those \n12  cases not binding authority, but they also did not even consider claims presented under section \na \nrt ni\nouor 13  12184(b)(2). Put differently, even if defendants were correct that they are not subject to sections \nCif\nt al\ncC 14  12184(b)(3) and (5), they have not presented any evidence that they would not be subject to \ni\nstrof \nDict  15  section 12184(b)(2), as discussed above. As was held in a related case, “Uber’s fixation on \ns ri\net\ntatDis 16  whether WAVs are specifically required by statute is unavailing in light of the broad language of \n Sn \ndr\nee 17  the ADA.” Crawford, 2018 WL 1116725, at *4. “A covered entity under Section 12184 is subject \nth\nnirt\nUo\nN 18  not just to the narrow requirements associated with the purchase of new vehicles, but the statute’s \n19  broader anti-discrimination mandate.” Id. \n20  C.  Failure to Provide Auxiliary Aids  \n21  Defendants next argue plaintiffs have failed to allege plausibly a failure to provide \n22  auxiliary aids. Section 12184 requires covered entities to “provide auxiliary aids and services,” 42 \n23  U.S.C. § 12184(b)(2)(B), to disabled individuals, unless doing so would “fundamentally alter” the \n24  nature of the provided service or “result in an undue burden,” id. § 12182(b)(2)(A)(iii). Plaintiffs \n25 \n \n26  4 Defendants argue in their reply brief that plaintiffs have forfeited their claim to equivalent \nservice by failing to address it in the response brief. Plaintiffs, however, do address the “equivalent \n27  service” issue. See Plaintiffs’ Memorandum in Opposition, ECF No. 100, at 14 n.78. \n28  ORDER \nCASE NO.  17-cv-06124-RS \n8 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-06124-RS   Document 102   Filed 03/13/20   Page 9 of 12\n \n1  allege UberWAV is an “auxiliary aid or service” which defendants were obligated to, and did not, \n2  provide. Defendants argue instead that this provision of the ADA is only intended to protect the \n3  hearing and vision impaired—a group into which plaintiffs do not fall. In support of their position, \n4  defendants cite a Department of Justice rule which expressly excludes individuals with mobility \n5  impairments from the “auxiliary aids and services” provisions of the ADA. See 56 Fed. Reg. \n6  35,544-01, 35,566 (July 26, 1991) (“DOJ Rule”). \n7  The DOJ Rule was issued after a notice-and-comment process and thus is owed Chevron \n8  deference. Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 842 (1984). “First, \n9  always, is the question whether Congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue. If the \n10  intent of Congress is clear, that is the end of the matter; for the court, as well as the agency, must \n11  give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress.” Id. at 842–43. If congressional \n12  intent is not clear, the court must determine at step two “whether the agency’s answer is based on \na \nrt ni\nouor 13  a permissible construction of the statute.” Id. at 843 (emphasis added). The agency’s interpretation \nCif\nt al\ncC 14  must be deferred to unless it is unreasonable. Id. at 845. \ni\nstrof \nDict  15  At step one, the first guide to Congress’s intent is the text of the statute. The ADA reads, in \ns ri\net\ntatDis 16  relevant part: \nd Srn   \nee 17 \nth The term “auxiliary aids and services” includes— \nnirt\nUo (A) qualified interpreters or other effective methods of making aurally \nN 18 \ndelivered materials available to individuals with hearing impairments; \n19  (B)  qualified  readers,  taped  texts,  or  other  effective  methods  of \nmaking  visually  delivered  materials  available  to  individuals  with \n20  visual impairments; \n(C) acquisition or modification of equipment or devices; and \n21 \n(D) other similar services and actions. \n \n22 \n42 U.S.C. § 12103(1). \n23 \n  In interpreting this text, each party offers a canon of statutory interpretation. Plaintiffs \n24 \nemploy the rule against surplusage, which they say dictates that, if subpart (A) governs individuals \n25 \nwith hearing impairments, and (B) those with visual impairments, then (C) and (D) must be about \n26 \nother disabled individuals, such as those with limited mobility, or they would be duplicative of (A) \n27 \n28  ORDER \nCASE NO.  17-cv-06124-RS \n9 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-06124-RS   Document 102   Filed 03/13/20   Page 10 of 12\n \n1  and (B). Defendants bring noscitur a sociis to the table, which they say requires subparts (C) and \n2  (D) to be interpreted in the context of the accompanying words, i.e. subparts (A) and (B), which \n3  limit the scope to individuals with hearing and visual impairments. Put differently, plaintiffs argue \n4  each subpart covers a type of disability; defendants assign each subpart to a means of \n5  accommodating disability. These statutory interpretations are equally reasonable. Substantive \n6  disagreements aside, then, these competing conclusions evince merely that the text is ambiguous. \n7  While other parts of the ADA—including section 12184(b)(2)(A), which covers \n8  “reasonable modifications,” as discussed above—contemplate accommodations which must be \n9  provided to those with mobility impairments, they do not foreclose that section 12184(b)(2)(B), \n10  which covers “auxiliary aids and services,” does so as well. Section 12184(b)(2)(A) is not \n11  explicitly or exclusively about individuals with mobility impairments. It could conceivably \n12  encompass the “reasonable modifications” necessary to accommodate those with hearing and \na \nrt ni\nouor 13  visual impairments as well. Neither party has cited any statutory text, legislative history, or \nCif\nt al\ncC 14  caselaw to the contrary. Therefore, section 12184(b)(2)(B) may be similarly wide-reaching. \ni\nstrof \nDict  15  The legislative history cited by plaintiffs also does not provide clarity. The Ninth Circuit \ns ri\net\ntatDis 16  allows legislative history to be consulted “cautiously” at step one of Chevron analysis but \n Sn \ndr\nee 17  precludes its use to “enforce a principle…that has no statutory reference point.” United Cook Inlet \nth\nnirt\nUo\nN 18  Drift Ass’n v. Nat’l Marine Fisheries Serv., 837 F.3d 1055, 1063 n.1 (9th Cir. 2016) (internal \n19  citations and quotations omitted). One cited portion of the legislative history indicates section \n20  12184(b), generally, applies to individuals with mobility impairments. H.R. Rep. No. 101-336, at \n21  401 (1990). It does not, however, specifically discuss the “auxiliary aids and services” \n22  requirement. Another cited provision clarifies that the examples provided in section 12103(1) are \n23  just examples, not an exhaustive list of “auxiliary aids and services.” Id. at 161. Again, however, \n24  that does not clarify how far past the list the term does extend. The final cited provision is perhaps \n25  plaintiffs’ best case: it uses the example of how a bookstore must be made accessible to \n26  wheelchair-bound individuals in the context of defining “auxiliary aids and services.” Id. at 161–\n27  62. However, even this piece of history does not go so far as to state affirmatively that “auxiliary \n28  ORDER \nCASE NO.  17-cv-06124-RS \n10 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-06124-RS   Document 102   Filed 03/13/20   Page 11 of 12\n \n1  aids and services” are not limited to hearing- and vision-impaired individuals. It is hardly “clear \n2  evidence” which “illuminate[s] ambiguous text.” Milner v. Dep’t of Navy, 562 U.S. 562, 572 \n3  (2011). See also Azar v. Allina Health Servs., 139 S. Ct. 1804, 1814 (2019) (declining to follow \n4  legislative history which was “ambiguous at best”). Thus, congressional intent is not clear. \n5  Moving on to Chevron step two, the DOJ Rule must be deferred to unless it is \n6  unreasonable. The Rule clearly provides that the provisions of the ADA encompassing “auxiliary \n7  aids and services” do not apply to individuals with mobility impairments because they are covered \n8  by other parts of the ADA, such as reasonable modifications. See DOJ Rule. Because the ADA \n9  requires “auxiliary aids and services” to be offered proactively, while “reasonable modifications” \n10  must be requested, plaintiffs point out the DOJ Rule creates two types of disabilities: those that \n11  must be affirmatively accommodated (hearing and vision impairments), and those that need not be \n12  accommodated absent a request (all other disabilities). While this system may not be what \na \nrt ni\nouor 13  plaintiffs prefer, “or even the reading the court would have reached if the question initially had \nCif\nt al\ncC 14  arisen in a judicial proceeding,” Chevron, 467 U.S. at 843 n.11, plaintiffs have not explained how \ni\nstrof \nDict  15  it is unreasonable. The DOJ might reasonably have considered, for example, that those who suffer \ns ri\net\ntatDis 16  from hearing and vision impairments may have more difficulty even communicating their need for \n Sn \ndr\nee 17  an accommodation than those with other disabilities. It seems the DOJ simply chose “among \nth\nnirt\nUo\nN 18  competing reasonable interpretations” of the ADA. Michigan v. E.P.A., 135 S. Ct. 2699, 2708 \n19  (2015). The courts have no authority to second-guess it. Thus plaintiffs, as a matter of law, cannot \n20  plausibly allege an “auxiliary aids and services” claim. \n21  Finally, defendants argue plaintiffs have failed to allege plausibly a failure to remove \n22  barriers, 42 U.S.C. § 12184(b)(2)(C), or a failure to communicate, 49 C.F.R. § 37.167(f). Plaintiffs \n23  did not respond to those arguments. Furthermore, when defendants’ reply indicated they \n24  considered plaintiffs’ nonresponses to amount to forfeiture of the arguments, plaintiffs did not \n25  move to clarify if they did not intend to do so. Plaintiffs’ theories regarding failure to remove \n26  barriers and failure to communicate are therefore dismissed. See Ardente, Inc. v. Shanley, No. 07-\n27  cv-04479, 2010 WL 546485, at *6 (N.D. Cal. Feb. 10, 2010) (“Plaintiff fails to respond to this \n28  ORDER \nCASE NO.  17-cv-06124-RS \n11 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-06124-RS   Document 102   Filed 03/13/20   Page 12 of 12\n \n1  argument and therefore concedes it through silence.”). \n2  V.  CONCLUSION \n3    For the reasons set forth above, the motion to dismiss is granted in part and denied in part. \n4  Plaintiffs have plausibly alleged a private right of action and a requested reasonable modification. \n5  However, they cannot plausibly allege a failure to provide auxiliary aids and have failed to \n6  respond to defendants’ arguments regarding a failure to remove barriers or to communicate. Those \n7  theories are therefore dismissed with prejudice. With these modifications, the SAC shall proceed \n8  as the operative complaint. \n9   \n10  IT IS SO ORDERED. \n11   \n12  Dated: March 12, 2020 \na \nrt ni\nouor 13  __________________________________________________________________________________ \nCif\nt al RRIICCHHAARRDD  SSEEEEBBOORRGG \ncC 14 \nstriof  UUniittedd SSttattes DDiisttriictt JJuddge \nDict  15   \ns ri\ntateDist 16   \n Sn \ndr\nee 17 \nth\nnirt\nUo\nN 18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28  ORDER \nCASE NO.  17-cv-06124-RS \n12 ",

INTRODUCTION \n \n2  1.  STEPHAN NAMISNAK is a person with a disability who lives in New Orleans, \n3  Louisiana. MR. NAMISNAK has Muscular Dystrophy.  \n4  2.  FRANCIS  FALLS  is  a  person  with  a  disability  who  lives  in  New  Orleans, \n5  Louisiana. MR. FALLS is afflicted with paraplegia as a result of a spinal cord injury. MR. FALLS \n6  is also missing his right arm.  \n7  3.  MITCHELL MIRAGLIA is a person with a disability who lives in New Orleans, \n8  Louisiana. MR. MIRAGLIA is a quadriplegic who has cerebral palsy and requires a wheelchair \n9  for mobility.  \n10  4.  Each of the named Plaintiffs use an electric wheelchair to get from place to place. \n11  Plaintiffs  can  do  practically  everything  a  non-disabled  person  can  do  with  the  appropriate \n12  accommodations for their disability – work, travel, and enjoy life. However, Plaintiffs are not able \n13  to drive. As a result, Plaintiffs primarily rely on public transportation to get around the New \n14  Orleans metro area.  \n15  5.  Defendants  Uber  Technologies,  Inc.  and  Rasier,  LLC  (collectively,  “Uber”) \n16  provide a mobile-phone app service that allows users to call a car to drive them from point A to \n17  point B for a fee. The app also allows people who own cars to sign up as drivers to provide those \n18  rides.  \n19  6.  Uber is operating a nation-wide demand-responsive transportation system.  \n20  7.  In  some  cities,  Uber  has  options  for  disabled  users  who  use  wheelchairs.  For \n21  example, if a user is in San Francisco, Portland, or Washington, D.C., they are shown an icon in the \n22  Uber app for “Uber Access.” By selecting that icon, those users shown options – UberASSIST \n23  and/or UberWAV. UberASSIST allows a person with a disability to hail a driver who has been \n24  specifically trained to assist riders into vehicles and who can accommodate folding wheelchairs, \n- 2 -   COMPLAINT            \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-06124-JSC   Document 1   Filed 10/26/17   Page 3 of 25\n \n1  walkers,  and  scooters.  UberWAV  allows  a  person  with  a  disability  to  hail  a  driver  with  a \n2  wheelchair-accessible vehicle. \n3  8.  Due to Plaintiffs’ need for a heavy electric wheelchair that cannot be folded up and \n4  placed in a car’s trunk, they are unable to utilize UberASSIST. However, Plaintiffs could benefit \n5  and utilize UberWAV – if it was available in New Orleans.  \n6  9.  Unfortunately, Defendants have refused to make the UberWAV program available to \n7  New Orleans users. \n8  10.  As a result of Uber’s refusal to make UberWAV available in New Orleans, persons \n9  with disabilities in New Orleans have no ability to call an accessible vehicle through the Uber app \n10  that will accommodate their needs. Even if there are drivers on the road who have such a vehicle or \n11  training, there is no way for a New Orleans users to find an UberWAV vehicle through the app. For \n12  this reason, Plaintiffs are excluded from Uber’s transportation services and application.  \n13  11.  Under the Americans With Disabilities Act, Uber is required to make reasonable \n14  modifications to its services, provide auxiliary aids and services, and remove barriers that deter \n15  persons with disabilities. Uber is plainly able to do these things – as evidenced by the fact that they \n16  offer UberWAV elsewhere. Furthermore, Uber’s ability to revise their app is evident by their \n17  periodic special promotions in which they alter the app to connect users to puppies, cake, and \n18  donuts for a single day.  For example, on the evening of the filing of this Complaint, Uber is hosting \n19  a free, “secret” music concert in New Orleans that can only be reached by taking an Uber – and is \n20  therefore completely inaccessible to Plaintiffs. Despite their clear ability to alter the app, defendants \n21  have chosen not to provide sufficient wheelchair-accessible services in New Orleans, Louisiana.  \n22  12.  As  such,  Uber  has  violated  their  legal  obligations  under  the  Americans  With \n23  Disabilities  Act  (“ADA”),  42  U.S.C.  §  12181,  et  seq.,  the  California  Disabled  Persons  Act, \n24 \n- 3 -   COMPLAINT            \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-06124-JSC   Document 1   Filed 10/26/17   Page 4 of 25\n \n1  California Civil Code § 54 et seq. (“CDPA”), and California's Unfair Competition Law (“UCL”) \n2  (Business & Professions Code § 17200 et seq.)  \n3  13.  According to the U.S. Department of Justice, Title III lawsuits over inaccessible \n4  transportation go “to the very heart of the ADA’s goals ‘to assure equality of opportunity, full \n5  participation, independent living, and economic self-sufficiency’ for individuals with disabilities.”1 \n6  Plaintiffs seek to vindicate the promises of federal and state law. \n7  II. JURISDICTION AND PARTIES \n8  14.  Jurisdiction: This is an action for relief pursuant to Title III of the Americans With \n9  Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12181 et seq. This Court is vested with original jurisdiction pursuant \n10  to 28 U.S.C. § 1331 and 1343. This court is vested with supplemental jurisdiction over Plaintiff’s \n11  state  law  claims  pursuant  to  28  U.S.C.  §  1367  as  this  claim  arises  out  of  the  same  case  or \n12  controversy as the federal claim. \n13  15.  Intradistrict Assignment: Because the claims described infra arose in the County of \n14  San Francisco, this case should be assigned to the San Francisco or Oakland Division of the \n15  Northern District of California per Local Rule 3-2(d). \n16  16.  Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b) because Defendants \n17  are headquartered in San Francisco, California.    \n18  17.  Plaintiff  STEPHAN  NAMISNAK  is  a  citizen  and  resident  of  New  Orleans, \n19  Louisiana. He uses an electric wheelchair for mobility. He is disabled within the meaning of the \n20  ADA. Mr. Namisnak’s motorized wheelchair cannot be folded into the trunk of a car. \n21  18.  Plaintiff FRANCIS FALLS is a citizen and resident of New Orleans, Louisiana. He \n22  uses an electric wheelchair for mobility. He is disabled within the meaning of the ADA. He requires \n23 \n                                                 \n24  1 National Federation of the Blind of California v. Uber Technologies, Inc., N. D. Cal. 14-cv-4086, \nR.

He uses a motorized wheelchair that cannot be \n2  folded into the trunk of a car. \n3  19.  Plaintiff  MITCHELL  MIRAGLIA  is  a  citizen  and  resident  of  New  Orleans, \n4  Louisiana. He uses an electric wheelchair for mobility. He is disabled within the meaning of the \n5  ADA. Mr. Miraglia’s motorized wheelchair cannot be folded into the trunk of a car. \n6  20.  Defendant UBER TECHNOLOGIES, INC. is a foreign corporation, organized \n7  under the laws of the  State of Delaware,  with  its principal  place of  business  located in  San \n8  Francisco, California. Uber Technologies, Inc.’s subsidiary, Rasier, LLC is registered with the \n9  Louisiana Secretary of State as charter number 41604705F.  \n10  21.  Defendant RASIER, LLC is a foreign corporation, organized under the laws of the \n11  State of Delaware, with its principal place of business located in San Francisco, California. Rasier, \n12  LLC is registered with the Louisiana Secretary of State as charter number 41585719Q. \n13  22.  Together,  Defendants  provide  an  extremely  popular  vehicles-for-hire  service \n14  whereby Uber drivers pick up customers and provide them with transportation in an automobile. \n15  Defendants  do not provide vehicles-for-hire services to mobility-impaired consumers  in  New \n16  Orleans  who  require  wheelchair-accessible  transportation  vehicles  that  can  accommodate  an \n17  electric wheelchair.  \n18  III.  FACTS \n19  Defendants Operate a Vehicle-for-Hire Transportation System in New Orleans  \n20  23.  Uber pioneered the vehicle-for-hire market across the United States. Anyone with \n21  access  to  a  smartphone  can  request  travel  services  from  Uber.  Uber’s  customers  use  a \n22  smartphone application to locate, schedule, and pay for their travel. Consumers enter into contracts \n23  and  business  relationships  by contacting  Uber  via electronic notification  using an  application \n24  downloaded to their smartphone (hereinafter known as the “Uber Application”). Upon receipt of a \n- 5 -   COMPLAINT            \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-06124-JSC   Document 1   Filed 10/26/17   Page 6 of 25\n \n1  request from a customer, Uber then dispatch a driver and vehicle to pick up the customer for \n2  transport to their desired location. Through use of the Uber Application, consumers agree to pay \n3  for the services with a credit card via their smartphone.  These charges may include safety fees, \n4  municipal fees, and other fees.   \n5  24.  Unlike taxi vehicles in New Orleans, where the fare rate is set by the New Orleans \n6  City Council, the fare rates for Uber customers is set by Uber according to Uber’s confidential and \n7  secret algorithm. Pursuant to Uber’s confidential and secret algorithm, Uber can charge more for its \n8  services depending on the time of day, number of drivers, or estimated profitability. The decision \n9  on the price displayed on the Uber Application is set solely by Uber.  \n10  25.  Upon information and belief, Uber can deduct fare from a driver if a rider complains \n11  about his/her safety, the professionalism of the driver, cleanliness of the vehicle, or incorrect \n12  designation and/or charges, among other issues.  \n13  26.  Uber requires that riders provide a “rating” of their driver prior to the next trip; Uber \n14  requests that drivers provide a “rating” of their rider prior to the next trip. These rating facilitate the \n15  transportation experience and provide valuable data and information to Uber.  \n16  27.  Uber has the ability and option to temporarily or permanently deactivate a rider’s \n17  account. \n18  28.  Uber has the ability and option to temporarily or permanently deactivate a driver’s \n19  account.  \n20  29.  Uber has the ability to charge a rider a “post-ride” fee (i.e. a cleaning fee) at the \n21  request of a rider.  \n22  30.  In the New Orleans area, Uber has the ability to “geo-lock” certain locations and \n23  prevent drivers from visiting those geographic areas.  \n24  31.  Upon information and belief, in the New Orleans area Uber has actually utilized its \n- 6 -   COMPLAINT            \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-06124-JSC   Document 1   Filed 10/26/17   Page 7 of 25\n \n1  ability to “geo-lock” certain locations. \n2  32.  Upon  information  and  belief,  Uber  has  the  ability  to  exclude  drivers  based  on \n3  personal features – such as how many years they have had a driver’s license in the United States.  \n4  33.  Upon information and belief, Uber has a policy against allowing individuals who \n5  have had a driver’s license in the United States for less than one year for driving for Uber in the \n6  New Orleans area.  \n7  34.  Upon information and belief, Uber has (or had in the recent past) a policy against \n8  allowing individuals with non-Louisiana license plates from driving for Uber in the New Orleans \n9  area.  \n10  35.  Upon information and belief, Uber assists, or has assted, drivers with purchasing \n11  new cars via co-signing leases and/or ownership agreements (i.e.   \n12  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-Jx6G68Wpo). \n13  36.  Uber’s  prior  CEO  wrote  on  Uber’s  official  blog:  “We  are  ‘Everyone's  Private \n14  Driver.’ We are Uber and we're rolling out a transportation system in a city near you.” \n15  37.  Upon  information  and  belief,  would-be  drivers  are  required  to  pass  a  “city \n16  knowledge test” and attend a brief interview with an employee of Uber. Upon information and \n17  belief, Uber has previously referred to itself as an “On– Demand Car Service.” \n18  38.  As one court summed it up:  \n19  Uber is deeply involved in marketing its transportation services, qualifying and \nselecting drivers, regulating and monitoring their performance, disciplining (or \n20  terminating)  those  who  fail  to  meet  standards,  and  setting  prices.2 \n \n21  39.  Uber has explicitly declared itself to be a “transportation system” over and over \n22  again. A few examples: \n23  A.  Decemember 5, 2011: “We are ‘Everyone's Private Driver.’ We are Uber \n24                                                   \n2 O'Connor v. Uber Techs., Inc., 82 F. Supp. 3d 1133, 1137 (N.D. Cal. 2015).  \n- 7 -   COMPLAINT            \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-06124-JSC   Document 1   Filed 10/26/17   Page 8 of 25\n \n1  and  we're  rolling  out  a  transportation  system  in  a  city  near  you.”3 \n \n2  B.  March 8, 2012: “So today could eventually be considered historical for \nthe city of Angels because it is today that Uber LA  is officially rolling \n3  out its transportation system in this fine city.  Now, how is some on-\ndemand town car service calling itself a transportation system? And \n4  how are a bunch of limos going to make this city better?  We’ve got a \nbunch of examples for you, but let me start with this: for every well \n5  utilized UberCar on the road, we’re taking 6 cars off the road and out of \nparking garages.”4  \n6     \nC.  June 8, 2012: Uber seeks to deliver the “World’s Finest Transportation \n7  System”5 \n \n8  D.  August  2,  2013:  “We're  finally  giving  this  city  the transportation \nsystem that it deserves.”6  \n9   \nE.  Uber engineers’ code “will contribute to accelerating the growth of a \n10  transportation system that will directly affect the lives of more than \nthree million people every single day.”7   \n11   \nF.  August  22:  2014:  Uber  “provides  the  city  with  a  more  efficient \n12  transportation system.”8   \n \n13  G.  December 14, 2014: “Uber platform allows for safe and reliable rides, \nsupporting and extending New Jersey’s public transportation system.”9\n14     \n \n15  H.  June  17,  2015:  “Uber  is  proud  to  support  the  Taxi  and  Limousine \nCommission’s  revised  rules  which  allow  tech  innovation  to  continue \n16  making New York City’s transportation system more progressive for all \nriders and drivers and ensure that drivers and passengers are protected.”10 \n17   \nI.  July 22, 2015: “Together, we can build an even better, more reliable \n18  transportation  system.  This  is  great  news  for  all  New  Yorkers, \nincluding Uber riders and drivers.”11   \n19   \n \n20                                                   \n3 https://newsroom.uber.com/take-ubers-new-logo-for-a-spin/ \n21  4 https://newsroom.uber.com/us-california/uber-la-officially-launched/ \n5 https://newsroom.uber.com/us-california/san-diego-launch/ \n22  6 https://newsroom.uber.com/mexico/uber-has-launched-in-mexico-city/ \n7 https://join.uber.com/engineering \n23  8 https://newsroom.uber.com/indonesia/delivering-a-new-choice-to-jakarta/ \n9 https://www.uber.com/blog/new-jersey/uber-improves-public-transportation-in-new-jersey/ \n24  10 https://newsroom.uber.com/us-new-york/statement-on-revised-tlc-rules/ \n11 https://newsroom.uber.com/us-new-york/statement-from-uber-nyc-general-manager-josh-mohrer/ \n- 8 -   COMPLAINT            \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-06124-JSC   Document 1   Filed 10/26/17   Page 9 of 25\n \n1   \n40.  Given Paragraphs 18 through 39, Uber is a transportation system and is engaged in \n2 \nthe provision of a transportation service and is therefore obligated to comply with the transportation \n3 \nstatutes and regulations of the ADA, found at 42 U.S.C § 12184 and 49 C.F.R. §§ 37.1-105.  \n4 \n41.  Given Paragraphs 18 through 39, as the provider of a transportation system, Uber is \n5 \nobligated to comply with the equivalent service standard set forth at 49 C.F.R. § 37.105. \n6 \nPlaintiffs are Unable to Use Defendants’ New Orleans App and Transportation Services in Their \n7  Current Form \n \n8  42.  STEPHAN NAMISNAK, FRANCIS FALLS, and MITCHELL MIRAGLIA desire \n9  service  from  vehicles  for  hire  to  run  errands,  attend  community  meetings,  reach  medical \n10  appointments, access medical services, engage in recreational activities, and to participate in civic \n11  engagement events. Plaintiffs are able to utilize some aspects of public transportation services. \n12  However,  access  to  Uber’s  transportation  services  would  provide  Plaintiffs  with  a  level  of \n13  convenience not afforded by public transportation.   \n14  43.  STEPHAN NAMISNAK, FRANCIS FALLS, and MITCHELL MIRAGLIA cannot \n15  successfully use Uber transportation services because Uber has completely failed to provide a \n16  button, option, or icon on the Uber Application for the New Orleans metro market which would \n17  allow a wheelchair user to summon a van-equipped vehicle. \n18  44.  STEPHAN  NAMISNAK,  FRANCIS  FALLS,  and  MITCHELL  MIRAGLIA  are \n19  aware that UberASSIST exists, but are is also aware that UberASSIST would not provide them with \n20  the ability to hail a lift-equipped vehicle. Without a lift-equipped vehicle Plaintiffs are unable to \n21  patronize Uber’s services. Accordingly, Plaintiffs FALLS and NAMISNAK are presently deterred \n22  from downloading the Uber application.   \n23 \n24 \n- 9 -   COMPLAINT            \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-06124-JSC   Document 1   Filed 10/26/17   Page 10 of 25\n \n1  45.  Plaintiff  MITCHELL  MIRAGLIA  previously  downloaded  the  Uber  application. \n2  Upon downloading the application, he messaged Uber asking if wheelchair accessible service was \n3  available.  \n4  46.  Upon information and belief, Uber sent a response message stating that wheelchair \n5  accessible service was not available.  \n6  47.  Upon information and belief, after learning that Uber does not provide accessible \n7  service in New Orleans, Plaintiff MITCHELL MIRAGLIA deleted the Uber application.  \n8  48.  By failing to provide service to MITCHELL MIRAGLIA, Uber was in total breach \n9  of any agreement or contract entered into with MITCHELL MIRAGLIA. By and through its total \n10  breach of the agreement, MITCHELL MIRAGLIA had sufficient grounds for recission of the \n11  contract.  \n12  49.  By deleting the Uber application, MITCHELL MIRAGLIA rescinded any agreement \n13  or contract he entered into with Uber.  \n14  50.  STEPHAN  NAMISNAK,  FRANCIS  FALLS,  and  MITCHELL  MIRAGLIA  are \n15  presently aware that if they tried to install and use the Uber Application that they would experience \n16  serious difficulty accessing the goods and utilizing the services offered by that service as a result of \n17  Uber’s (1) failure to provide a button, option, or icon which provides access to an accessible vehicle \n18  capable of transporting an electric wheelchair, (2) failure to provide  auxiliary  aids and services \n19  necessary to allow full use and enjoyment of its transportation services, and (3) failure to ensure \n20  that a minimum number of accessible vehicles in Uber’s fleet are wheelchair-accessible.  \n21  51.   STEPHAN NAMISNAK, FRANCIS FALLS, and MITCHELL MIRAGLIA desire \n22  to use the Uber Application, but fear that they will experience serious difficulty in utilizing the \n23  application due to the discrimination detailed herein.  \n24 \n- 10 -   COMPLAINT            \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-06124-JSC   Document 1   Filed 10/26/17   Page 11 of 25\n \n1  52.  An accessible transportation option through the Uber app would make STEPHAN \n2  NAMISNAK, FRANCIS FALLS, and MITCHELL MIRAGLIA more independent.  \n3  53.  The ADA violations detailed herein exclude FRANCIS STEPHAN NAMISNAK, \n4  FRANCIS  FALLS,  and  MITCHELL  MIRAGLIA  from  the  programs,  services,  and \n5  accommodations offered by Defendants to the public.  \n6  54.  STEPHAN NAMISNAK, FRANCIS FALLS, and MITCHELL MIRAGLIA plan to \n7  and will attempt to use the Uber Application and Uber’s programs, services, and accommodations \n8  in the future as patrons should those programs, services, and accommodations become wheelchair-\n9  accessible.  \n10  55.  STEPHAN  NAMISNAK,  FRANCIS  FALLS,  and  MITCHELL  MIRAGLIA \n11  presently fear that they will encounter the mobility-related barriers which exist within  Uber’s \n12  Application and services.  \n13  56.  STEPHAN NAMISNAK, FRANCIS FALLS, and MITCHELL MIRAGLIA desire \n14  to utilize the Uber Application and service, but will continue to experience serious difficulty until \n15  the ADA violations detailed herein are removed. \n16  57.  STEPHAN NAMISNAK, FRANCIS FALLS, and MITCHELL MIRAGLIA intend \n17  to and will attempt to utilize Uber’s programs, services, and accommodations in the future, but fear \n18  that Uber will continue to discriminate against them by failing to bring their Uber Application and \n19  transportation services into compliance with the requirements of the ADA. \n20  58.  Upon information and belief, making the programs, services, and accommodations \n21  offered through the Uber Application accessible to persons with mobility-related disabilities is \n22  readily achievable, reasonably feasible, and easily accomplished, and would not place an undue \n23  burden on Uber. \n24 \n- 11 -   COMPLAINT            \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-06124-JSC   Document 1   Filed 10/26/17   Page 12 of 25\n \n1  59.  Upon information and belief, making the programs, services, and accommodations \n2  offered  through  the  Uber  Application  accessible  would  provide  STEPHAN  NAMISNAK, \n3  FRANCIS FALLS, and MITCHELL MIRAGLIA with an equal opportunity to participate in, or \n4  benefit from, the programs, services, and accommodations which Uber offers to the general public. \n5  60.  The  harm  sustained  by  Plaintiffs  –  the  inability  to  access  the  services  and \n6  accommodations offered by Uber – is the expected and foreseeable consequence of Uber’s failure \n7  to  comply  with  the  requirements  and  mandates  of  the  ADA.  The  statute  and  accompanying \n8  regulations  exist  to  ensure  that  those  with  mobility-related  limitations  will  have  full  use  of \n9  transportation services. If Uber failed to adhere to its legal obligations under these regulations, it \n10  was imminently foreseeable that individuals with disabilities would sustain the exact harms alleged \n11  by Plaintiffs in this lawsuit.    \n12  61.  STEPHAN NAMISNAK, FRANCIS FALLS, and MITCHELL MIRAGLIA have \n13  been obligated to retain the undersigned counsel for the filing and prosecution of this action. \n14  STEPHAN NAMISNAK, FRANCIS FALLS, and MITCHELL MIRAGLIA are entitled to have \n15  their reasonable attorneys’ fees, costs, and expenses paid by Uber, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 12205.  \n16  Uber’s History of App Modifications \n17  62.  Upon  information  and  belief,  modification  of  the  programs,  services,  and \n18  accommodations  offered  through  the  Uber  Application  could  be  easily  accomplished,  as  is \n19  evidenced by the various promotions and modifications which are commonly made by Uber during \n20  the regular course of their operations.  \n21  63.  On January 5, 2015, Uber ran a promotion in New Orleans known as “Uber King \n22  Cakes.”  During  this  promotion,  the  Uber  Application  would  display  a  small  King  Cake.12 \n23  Customers could select this “King Cake” icon and have drivers deliver a King Cake to them for a \n24                                                   \n12 See Exhibit “A.” \n- 12 -   COMPLAINT            \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-06124-JSC   Document 1   Filed 10/26/17   Page 13 of 25\n \n1  fee. This change to the Uber Application was only present for one day. At the conclusion of the \n2  promotion, Uber restored the Uber Application to its original state.  \n3  64.  On Thursday, August 27, 2015, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania Uber ran a promotion \n4  known as “UberPUPPIES.”13 During this promotion customers could utilize the Uber Application \n5  to have drivers deliver a live Puppy to their office for “15 minutes of puptastic playtime.” Upon \n6  information and belief, at the end of the “UberPUPPIES” promotion, the Uber Application returned \n7  to its original state.  \n8  65.  On  April  13,  2016,  in  New  Orleans,  Uber  ran  a  promotion  known  as \n9  “UberDONUTS.”14 From 10:00am to 12:00pm, users could select a donut icon in their Uber app to \n10  have a driver deliver two free donuts to their door. At the end of the “UberDONUTS” promotion, \n11  the Uber Application returned to its original state.  \n12  66.  The  above  examples  demonstrate  how  easy  it  would  be  for  Uber  to  provide  a \n13  wheelchair-accessible icon or button on its Uber Application for the New Orleans metro market, as \n14  it does in other cities. Despite the ease with which Uber could make its service available to persons \n15  in a wheelchair, Uber has intentionally chosen to not provide services to persons who use electric \n16  wheelchairs in New Orleans.  \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n                                                 \n24  13 See Exhibit “B.” \n14 https://newsroom.uber.com/us-louisiana/uberversary-donuts-on-demand/ \n- 13 -   COMPLAINT            \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-06124-JSC   Document 1   Filed 10/26/17   Page 14 of 25\n \n1  67.  In some limited locations, Uber have installed an icon on its Uber Application in an \n2  attempt to comply with the ADA. In some cities, including San Francisco, Los Angeles, Portland, \n3  and Washington D.C., Uber have installed on its Uber Application an icon known as Uber Access. \n4  (See Figure One, infra.). \n5  68.  Once a user selects the Access icon, one or two of two options appear: UberASSIST \n6  and UberWAV.   \n7  69.  UberASSIST, according to Uber, “is designed to provide additional assistance to \n8  seniors  and  people  with  disabilities.  Driver-partners  are  specifically  trained  by  Open  Doors \nFig. 1:  An image of Uber Access, available in some cities – but \n9  Organization to assist ridersn oint tNo evweh Oicrlleesa nasn,d L cAa.n   accommodate folding wheelchairs, walkers, and \n(Source: https://newsroom.uber.com/canada/uberwav/) \n10  scooters.”15 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n70.  However,  according  to  Uber,  “Note:  ASSIST  vehicles  do  not  have  accessible \n19 \nramps.”16 \n20 \n71.  Persons who use an electric wheelchair are unable to use UberASSIST as they \n21 \nrequire transportation with a ramp.  \n22 \n23 \n                                                 \n24  15 See Exhibit “C” \n16 Id.  \n- 14 -   COMPLAINT            \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-06124-JSC   Document 1   Filed 10/26/17   Page 15 of 25\n \n1  72.  Upon  information  and  belief,  in  San  Francisco,  Los  Angeles,  and  other  cities, \n2  Defendants offers UberWAV, which provides wheelchair accessible vehicles. \n3  73.  Upon information and belief, Uber can remove their accessible icons at any time, \n4  thereby creating a significant need for injunctive relief. On September 2, 2014, Uber issued a press \n5  release stating that it was offering accessible transportation services in Houston, Texas.  \n6  74.  Upon information and belief, Uber began offering accessible transportation service \n7  in Houston, Texas called UberACCESS. \n8  75.  As of May 6, 2017, the Uber Application for Houston, Texas does not feature or \n9  display UberACCESS. (See Figure 2, Infra). \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20   \nFig. 2:  An image of Uber’s app available in Houston, Texas as \n21    of May 6, 2017.  \n(Source: Screenshot taken by plaintiff’s counsel) \n22   \n23  76.  Upon information and belief, Uber either discontinued its UberACCESS service in \n24  Houston, Texas or no longer publicly displays the UberACCESS option. This demonstrates that \n- 15 -   COMPLAINT            \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-06124-JSC   Document 1   Filed 10/26/17   Page 16 of 25\n \n1  Uber has the capability to reduce or eliminate its accessibility options at will, and evidences the \n2  need for injunctive relief.  \n3  77.  On information and belief, when a driver with a wheelchair-accessible vehicle in a \n4  city without UberWAV contacts Uber, they are told that they cannot participate in UberWAV. \n5  78.  The actions committed by Uber which resulted in this lawsuit have their genesis or \n6  origin in the San Francisco, California.  \n7  79.  Upon information and belief, Uber created and performs modifications to the Uber \n8  Application from San Francisco, California. \n9  80.  Upon  information  and  belief,  Uber  enacts  and  supervises  its  policies  from  San \n10  Francisco, California. \n11  81.  Upon information and belief, Uber exert significant control over the implementation \n12  of its policies from San Francisco, California. \n13  82.  Upon information and belief, a majority of Uber’s supervision of its drivers occurs \n14  from San Francisco, California. \n15  Uber’s Free Galantis Show and Exclusion of Plaintiffs \n16  83.  On Tuesday, October 24, 2017, Uber sent out an email to its customers entitled \n17  “Shhh. Galantis has a secret show Thursday night.” \n18  84.  The top of the email contained a photographs of the band Galantis. Immediately \n19  below the photograph was an image of Uber logo and the following text: \n20  “This Thursday night, we’re going to give you something to do–we’re hosting a \n21  secret show featuring Galantis! \n22  Wanna run away to an exclusive performance? Your ticket is in your Uber app.” \n23  85.  Information about Uber’s free Galantis show was widely publicized over the \n24 \n- 16 -   COMPLAINT            \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-06124-JSC   Document 1   Filed 10/26/17   Page 17 of 25\n \n1  internet, including through Uber’s Blog17, through River Beats, a broadcasting and media \n2  production company in New Orleans18, and through social media. (See Exhibit D.)  \n3  86.  Based on available information, on Thursday, October 26, 2017, at 6:00 p.m., Uber’s \n4  application will change and will display an option for “Galantis.” Based on the information \n5  provided by Uber, customers who select this option will be picked up (along with 3 guests) and will \n6  brought to a secret show for an exclusive intimate performance by Galantis. \n7  87.  Unfortunately, due to the lack of any options for the summoning of a Wheelchair \n8  Accessible Vehicles through the Uber application, Plaintiffs are completely excluded from the free, \n9  secret Galantis show that is hosted by Uber.  \n10  88.  Further, due to the “secret” nature of Uber’s event featuring Galantis, Plaintiffs are \n11  unable to otherwise attend or patronize the event.  \n12  89.  All three named Plaintiffs were aware of the free Galantis show hosted by Uber and \n13  are deterred from making an attempt to patronize this show due to Uber’s complete failure to \n14  provide Wheelchair Accessible Vehicles or another means of accessing the event.   \n15  90.  Given Paragraphs 83 through 89, Uber is also operating a place of public \n16  accommodation and is therefore was obligated to comply with the statutes and regulations for \n17  places of public accommodation, namely 42 U.S.C § 12182 and 28 C.F.R. § 36.101-310. \n18  IV. CAUSES OF ACTION \n19  COUNT I – VIOLATION OF TITLE III  \nOF THE AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT \n20   \n91.  Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference the above allegations set forth in the \n21 \nComplaint as if fully set forth herein. \n22 \n23 \n                                                 \n24  17 https://www.uber.com/blog/new-orleans/galantis-secret-show/ (last accessed on 10/25/2017).  \n18 https://riverbeats.life/galantis-teams-uber-launch-secret-show-new-orleans/ (last accessed on 10/25/2017).  \n- 17 -   COMPLAINT            \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-06124-JSC   Document 1   Filed 10/26/17   Page 18 of 25\n \n1  92.  Title III of the ADA prohibits discrimination against persons with disabilities by \n2  places  of  public  accommodation  and  by  private  entities  providing  certain  services,  including \n3  specified public transportation services. Spector v. Norwegian Cruise Line Ltd., 545 U.S. 119, 128 \n4  (2005) (“Title III of the ADA prohibits discrimination against the disabled in the full and equal \n5  enjoyment of public accommodations, 42 U.S.C. § 12182(a), and public transportation services, § \n6  12184(a).”); 42 U.S.C. § 12182 (“Prohibition of discrimination by public accommodations”); 42 \n7  U.S .C. § 12184 (“Prohibition of discrimination in specified public transportation services provided \n8  by private entities”). \n9  93.  “The term ‘specified public transportation’ means transportation by bus, rail, or any \n10  other conveyance (other than by aircraft) that provides the general public with general or special \n11  service (including charter service) on a regular and continuing basis.” 42 U.S.C. § 12181(10). \n12  Public transportation services include “demand responsive systems,” which means “any system of \n13  providing transportation of individuals by a vehicle, other than a system which is a fixed route \n14  system.” 42 U.S.C. § 12181(3). \n15  94.  In  addition,  regulations  promulgated  by  the  United  States  Secretary  of \n16  Transportation provide that: “No entity shall discriminate against an individual with a disability in \n17  connection with the provision of transportation service.” 49 C.F.R. § 37.5(a).  \n18  95.  Defendants provide a demand responsive transportation system as defined by 42 \n19  U.S.C. § 12181. Defendants have been held to be a covered entity under Title III of the ADA. \n20  See, e.g., Ramos v. Uber Technologies, 2015 WL 758087 at *5-6 (W.D. Tex., Feb. 20, 2015). \n21  96.  Under Section 12184(a)(2) of the ADA, discrimination includes the failure of an \n22  entity to: \n23  (A)   make reasonable modifications consistent with those required under section \n12182(b)(2)(A)(ii) of this title; \n24  (B)   provide auxiliary aids and services consistent with the requirements of section \n12182(b)(2)(A)(iii) of this title; and \n- 18 -   COMPLAINT            \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-06124-JSC   Document 1   Filed 10/26/17   Page 19 of 25\n \n1  (C)   remove barriers consistent with the requirements of section 12182(b)(2)(A) of \nthis title and with the requirements of section 12183(a)(2) of this title; \n2   \n97.  Under Section 12182(b)(2)(C)(i) of the ADA, discrimination can also include: “a \n3 \nfailure of a private entity which operates a demand responsive system and which is not subject to \n4 \nsection 12184 of this title to operate such system so that, when viewed in its entirety, such system \n5 \nensures  a  level  of  service  to  individuals  with  disabilities,  including  individuals  who  use \n6 \nwheelchairs, equivalent to the level of service provided to individuals without disabilities.” \n7 \n98.  “Equivalent” is defined under the ADA’s regulations at 49 CFR § 37.105 to mean \n8 \n“equivalent  to  the  service  provided  other  individuals  with  respect  to  the  following  service \n9 \ncharacteristics: \n10 \n(a)   (1) Schedules/headways (if the system is fixed route); \n11    (2) Response time (if the system is demand responsive); \n(b) Fares; \n12  (c) Geographic area of service; \n(d) Hours and days of service; \n13  (e) Availability of information; \n(f) Reservations capability (if the system is demand responsive); \n14  (g) Any constraints on capacity or service availability; \n  (h) Restrictions priorities based on trip purpose (if the system is demand responsive). \n15 \n99.  Defendants and their service providers have failed to provide any mechanism by \n16 \nwhich  to  adequately  serve  mobility-impaired  individuals  such  as  Plaintiffs  or  others  similarly \n17 \nsituated.  Moreover,  Defendants  have  refused  to  make  reasonable  accommodations  in  policies, \n18 \npractices, and procedures or to provide auxiliary aids and services necessary to allow full use and \n19 \nenjoyment of their transportation services by Plaintiffs. Defendants have failed to remove the \n20 \nbarriers to Plaintiffs’ use of their services.  \n21 \n100.  Defendants have discriminated and are discriminating against Plaintiffs in violation \n22 \nof the ADA by failing to provide accessible transportation services. \n23 \n101.  Defendants  continue  to  discriminate  against  the  Plaintiffs  by  failing  to  make \n24 \nreasonable  modifications  in  policies,  practices  or  procedures,  when  such  modifications  are \n- 19 -   COMPLAINT            \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-06124-JSC   Document 1   Filed 10/26/17   Page 20 of 25\n \n1  necessary to afford accessible transportation services to individuals with disabilities; and by failing \n2  to take such efforts that may be necessary to ensure that no individual with a disability is excluded, \n3  denied  goods  and  services,  segregated  or  otherwise  treated  differently  than  other  individuals \n4  because of the absence of auxiliary aids and services. \n5  102.  Additionally, by failing to provide access options to New Orleans users who require \n6  an electric wheelchair, Defendants have failed to meet the requirements of 49 C.F.R. § 37.167 that \n7  “the entity shall make available to individuals with disabilities adequate information concerning \n8  transportation  services,  [which]  includes  making  adequate  communications  capacity  available, \n9  though accessible formats and technology, to enable users to obtain information and schedule \n10  service.”  \n11  103.  Defendants have discriminated and are discriminating against Plaintiffs in violation \n12  of the ADA by failing to make a place a public accommodation accessible to Plaintiffs. Namely, \n13  Defendants have failed to provide a means by which Plaintiffs can access the free, secret Galantis \n14  show. This show is available and accessible to persons who do not have a disability that requires \n15  them to utilize an electric wheelchair.    \n16  104.  Plaintiffs have been injured by the discrimination they encountered when they were \n17  deterred from using Defendants’ transportation services and they continue to be injured by their \n18  inability to patronize Defendants’ services. They have additionally been injured by the stigma of \n19  Defendants’ discrimination. \n20  105.  Plaintiffs’ injuries are traceable to Defendants’ discriminatory conduct, policies, or \n21  lack of policies alleged herein and will be redressed by the relief requested. Plaintiffs have been \n22  injured and will continue to be injured by Defendants’ failure to comply with the ADA and \n23  Defendants’ ongoing, continued acts of discrimination. \n24 \n- 20 -   COMPLAINT            \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-06124-JSC   Document 1   Filed 10/26/17   Page 21 of 25\n \n1  106.  Defendants  have  control  over  their  drivers’  ADA  compliance.  For  example,  a  \n2  term of the contract between Uber and its drivers bars drivers from denying users who have service \n3  animals:  \n4  You understand and agree that you have a legal obligation under the Americans \nwith  Disabilities  Act  and  similar  state  laws  to  transport  Users  with  Service \n5  Animals (as defined by applicable state and federal law), including guide dogs for \nthe blind and visually impaired Users, and there is no exception to this obligation \n6  for allergies or religious objections. Your knowing failure to transport a User with \na Service Animal shall constitute a material breach of this Agreement. You agree \n7  that a “knowing failure” to comply with this legal obligation shall constitute \neither: (1) a denial of a ride where you state the denial was due to a Service \n8  Animal;  or  (2)  there  is  more  than  one  (1)  instance  in  which  a  User  or  the \ncompanion of a User alleges that you cancelled or refused a ride on the basis of a \n9  Service Animal.   \n \n10  107.  The Uber contract with drivers does not, however, have a provision barring drivers \n11  from denying service to wheelchair users.  \n12  108.  As a result of their inability to use Defendants’ services, Plaintiffs are suffering \n13  irreparable harm. \n14  109.  Although Plaintiffs have not downloaded or used the Uber Application, Title III of \n15  the ADA does not “require a person with a disability to engage in a futile gesture if such person has \n16  actual notice that a person or organization covered by this subchapter does not intend to comply \n17  with its provisions.” 42 U.S.C. § 12188; Pickern v. Holiday Quality Foods, Inc., 293 F.3d 1133, \n18  1136–37  (9th  Cir.2002)  (“under  the  ADA,  once  a  plaintiff  has  actually  become  aware  of \n19  discriminatory conditions existing at a public accommodation, and is thereby deterred from visiting \n20  or patronizing that accommodation, the plaintiff has suffered an injury,” and “[s]o long as the \n21  discriminatory conditions continue, and so long as a plaintiff is aware of them and remains deterred, \n22  the injury under the ADA continues”). \n23  110.  Here, Plaintiffs are being deterred from patronizing Defendants’ services as a result \n24  of their personal knowledge of the violations stated above. Defendants’ refusal to provide service to \n- 21 -   COMPLAINT            \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-06124-JSC   Document 1   Filed 10/26/17   Page 22 of 25\n \n1  people with disabilities in New Orleans is a topic of conversation among Plaintiffs’ community. \n2  Plaintiffs are aware that UberWAV is offered in other cities but not in New Orleans.   \n3  111.  Plaintiffs have experienced the difficulty and frustration of past denials of services, \n4  including transportation services, in other contexts, and so chose not to engage in a process they \n5  know to be futile with Uber.  \n6  112.  Pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 12188, this Court has authority to grant Plaintiffs’ injunctive \n7  relief, including an Order that Defendants’ transportation services are in violation of the ADA and \n8  requiring  Defendants’  to  alter  the  Uber  Application  to  make  it  accessible  to  and  useable  by \n9  individuals with mobility disabilities to the full extent required by Title III of the ADA. \n10   \n11   \n12  COUNT II - VIOLATION OF THE  \nCALIFORNIA DISABLED PERSONS ACT \n13   \n113.  Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference the above allegations set forth in the \n14 \nComplaint as if fully set forth herein. \n15 \n114.  Pursuant to the remedies, procedures, and rights set forth in Cal. Civ. Code § 52, \n16 \nPlaintiffs pray for judgment as set forth below. \n17 \n115.  Defendants operate, within the jurisdiction of the State of California, places of public \n18 \naccommodation and/or places to which the general public is invited and, as such, is obligated to \n19 \ncomply with the provisions of the California Disabled Persons Act (CDPA), Cal. Civ. Code § 54, et \n20 \nseq.  \n21 \n116.  The conduct alleged herein violated the CDPA, including without limitation Cal. \n22 \nCiv. Code, § 54.1, et seq. The CDPA guarantees, inter alia, that persons with disabilities are \n23 \nentitled to full and equal access, as other members of the general public, to accommodations, \n24 \nadvantages, facilities, and privileges of covered entities. \n- 22 -   COMPLAINT            \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-06124-JSC   Document 1   Filed 10/26/17   Page 23 of 25\n \n1  117.  Defendants have violated the CDPA by, inter alia, denying Plaintiff and members of \n2  the proposed class, as persons with disabilities, full and equal access, as other members of the \n3  general public, to accommodations, advantages, and facilities offered by Defendants. \n4  118.  Defendants have violated the CDPA by, inter alia, failing to operate their services \n5  on  a  nondiscriminatory  basis  and  failing  to  ensure  that  persons  with  disabilities  have \n6  nondiscriminatory access to their transportation services. \n7  119.  In committing the acts and/or omissions alleged herein, Defendants wrongfully and \n8  unlawfully denied access to their transportation services to individuals with disabilities and acted \n9  with knowledge of the effect their conduct was having on persons with physical disabilities. \n10  120.  Defendants have violated the CDPA by being, as listed above, in violation of both \n11  California Standards and the ADA.  Plaintiffs are not required to prove intent or actual damages to \n12  recover minimum statutory damages under the CPDA. \n13  121.  Plaintiffs are deterred  from patronizing Defendants’ transportation services as  a \n14  result of their actual knowledge of the violations stated above. \n15  122.  Pursuant to the remedies, procedures, and rights set forth in California law, including \n16  Cal. Civ. Code § 54, Plaintiff prays for judgment as set forth below. \n17  COUNT III – VIOLATION OF CALIFORNIA’S UNFAIR COMPETITION LAW  \n18  123.  Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference the above allegations set forth in the \n19  Complaint as if fully set forth herein. \n20  124.  California's  Unfair  Competition  Law  (“UCL”)  (Business  &  Professions  Code  § \n21  17200  et  seq.) bars  “unfair  competition,”  which  includes  any  “unlawful,  unfair  or  fraudulent \n22  business act or practice and unfair, deceptive, untrue or misleading advertising.” \n23  125.  In passing the UCL, the legislature “intended to permit courts to enjoin ongoing \n24  wrongful business conduct in whatever context such activity might occur.” Comm. on Children’s \n- 23 -   COMPLAINT            \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-06124-JSC   Document 1   Filed 10/26/17   Page 24 of 25\n \n1  Television, Inc. v. Gen. Foods Corp., 35 Cal. 3d 197, 210 (1983). \n2  126.  The UCL  “‘borrows’ violations of other laws  and treats  these violations, when \n3  committed pursuant to business activity, as unlawful practices independently actionable under [the \n4  UCL].” Farmers Ins. Exch. v. Super. Ct., 2 Cal. 4th 377, 383 (1992); Clerkin v. MyLife.com, Inc., \n5  No. C 11– 00527 CW, 2011 WL 3607496, at *6 (N.D. Cal. Aug. 16, 2011) (“Violation of almost \n6  any federal, state or local law may serve as the basis for a UCL claim.”). \n7  127.  Defendants business practices described above are unfair competition under the UCL \n8  because they violate the ADA and CDPA. \n9  128.  Defendants business practices described above are unfair competition also because \n10  Defendants’  failure  to  provide  accommodations  gives  them  an  unfair  advantage  relative  to \n11  traditional taxi cab companies.  \n12  129.  As a result of Defendants unfair competition business practices described above, \n13  Plaintiffs have suffered injury in fact and have lost money. For example, they have been forced to \n14  take more expensive taxi cabs, thus losing money.  \n15  V. JURY DEMAND \n16  130.  Plaintiffs request a trial by jury.  \n17  VI. RELIEF REQUESTED \n18    WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs demand judgment against Defendants, and request the following \n19  relief: \n20  A.  that this Court declare that Defendants’ policies, procedures, and services have been \n21  provided in a discriminatory manner which violates the ADA, the California Disabled \n22  Persons Act, and California’s Business & Professions Code § 17200;  \n23  B.  that this Court declare that Defendants’ violations of the anti-discrimination statutes of \n24  California were intentional; \n- 24 -   COMPLAINT            \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-06124-JSC   Document 1   Filed 10/26/17   Page 25 of 25\n \n1  C.  that this Court Order injunctive relief to require Defendants to bring their transportation \n2  service into compliance and remain in compliance with state and federal anti-discrimination \n3  statutes;  \n4  D.  that this Court award damages in restitution to Plaintiffs;  \n5  E.  that this Court award reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs (including expert fees) and other \n6  expenses of suit; and    \n7  F.  that this Court award such other and further relief as it deems necessary, just, proper, and \n8  appropriate.   \n9  Respectfully submitted, this the twenty-sixth day of October, 2017, \n \n10  By Plaintiffs, by and through their counsel, \n \n11 \nBIZER & DEREUS, LLC \n12  Garret S.

INTRODUCTION   \ns ri\net\ntatDis 16    This case involves a dispute over the application of the Americans with Disabilities Act \nd Srn \nee 17  (“ADA”) to the Uber rideshare service. Invoking federal question jurisdiction, plaintiffs Stephan \nth\nnirt\nUo\nN 18  Namisnak and Francis Falls (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) filed this action against defendants Uber \n19  Technologies, Inc. and Raiser, LLC (collectively, “Uber”). 28 U.S.C. § 1331. Uber moves to \n20  dismiss Plaintiffs’ First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) in its entirety for failure to state a claim \n21  under section 12184 or section 12182. 42 U.S.C. §§ 12182, 12184. Uber argues Plaintiffs fail to \n22  state a claim under section 12184 because they have not requested an accommodation, as required \n23  under section 12182(b)(2)(A)(ii) (referenced by way of section 12184(b)(2)(A)). Uber further \n24  argues Plaintiffs fail to state a claim under section 12182 because Uber does not qualify as a place \n25  of public accommodation. For the reasons set forth below, the motion to dismiss is denied in part \n26  and granted in part, with leave to amend.  \n27 \n28 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-06124-RS   Document 84   Filed 10/03/18   Page 2 of 11\n \n1  II. BACKGROUND1 \n2    Uber operates a vehicle-for-hire service that uses a mobile phone application (the “Uber \n3  App”). The Uber App allows users to request and pay for rides or other services through their \n4  credit card linked Uber account. Through this application, Uber offers various rideshare request \n5  options and has occasionally offered promotional services allowing users to order a free delivery \n6  of cake, doughnuts, or even puppies to their location. In certain major cities, Uber offers an option \n7  called “uberWAV” which enables riders to request a wheelchair accessible vehicle through the \n8  Uber App. Uber does not currently offer uberWAV in New Orleans, Louisiana.  \n9    Plaintiffs are persons with disabilities who reside in New Orleans. Both plaintiffs use \n10  electric wheelchairs and rely on public transportation services to get around. While Plaintiffs \n11  would like to use Uber’s transportation service, they cannot because the Uber App does not offer \n12  uberWAV in New Orleans. On October 24, 2017, Uber emailed customers in the New Orleans \n a\n rtni\nouor 13  area about an exclusive show featuring the band Galantis. As explained in Uber’s promotional \nCif\nt al\ncC 14  materials, on the day of the show, the Uber App would display an option called “Galantis” which \ni\nstrof \nDict  15  would summon a car to take the user to the “secret” location of the concert. Because the Uber App \ns ri\net\ntatDis 16  did not allow users to request a wheelchair accessible vehicle, Plaintiffs insist they had no way to \nd Srn \nee 17  get to the concert. \nth\nnirt\nUo\nN 18  Plaintiffs have not downloaded the Uber App because they know it would not allow them \n19  to request a vehicle that could accommodate their electric wheelchairs. If Uber were to offer a ride \n20  service that could accommodate electric wheelchairs, Plaintiffs would attempt to use the service \n21  and participate in Uber’s promotional events. By failing to provide a mechanism to serve \n22  individuals who use electric or otherwise non-foldable wheelchairs, Plaintiffs assert, Uber has \n23  violated its obligations under Title III of the ADA. See 42 U.S.C. §§ 12182, 12184. Plaintiffs seek \n24  declaratory and injunctive relief. 42 U.S.C. § 12188. \n25 \n                                                 \n26 \n1 Except where noted, the facts in this section are drawn from Plaintiffs’ FAC and are taken as true \n27  for the purpose of deciding the motion to dismiss. \n28  ORDER GRANTING IN PART AND DENYING IN PART MOTION TO DISMISS \nCASE NO.  17-cv-06124-RS \n2 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-06124-RS   Document 84   Filed 10/03/18   Page 3 of 11\n \n1  III. LEGAL STANDARD \n2  A complaint must contain “a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the \n3  pleader is entitled to relief.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2). While Rule 8 “does not require detailed \n4  factual allegations,” a complaint must have sufficient factual allegations to “state a claim to relief \n5  that is plausible on its face.” Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (citing Bell Atlantic v. \n6  Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555, 570 (2007)) (internal quotations omitted). A claim is facially \n7  plausible “when the pleaded factual content allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that \n8  the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.” Id. This determination is a context-specific \n9  task requiring the court “to draw on its judicial experience and common sense.” Id. at 679. \n10    A motion to dismiss a complaint under Rule 12(b)(6) tests the legal sufficiency of the \n11  claims alleged in the complaint. See Parks Sch. of Bus., Inc. v. Symington, 51 F.3d 1480, 1484 (9th \n12  Cir. 1995). Dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) may be based on either the “lack of a cognizable legal \n a\n rtni\nouor 13  theory” or on “the absence of sufficient facts alleged under a cognizable legal theory.” Balistreri v. \nCif\nt al\ncC 14  Pacifica Police Dep’t, 901 F.2d 696, 699 (9th Cir. 1990). When evaluating such a motion, the \ni\nstrof \nDict  15  court must accept all material allegations in the complaint as true, even if doubtful, and construe \ns ri\net\ntatDis 16  them in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.

DISCUSSION \n21  In a single claim for relief, Plaintiffs allege Uber violated Title III of the ADA under two \n22  independent theories. First, Plaintiffs argue Uber is a specified public transportation service that \n23  discriminates against persons with disabilities by failing to provide wheelchair accessible service, \n24  in violation of section 12184. Second, Plaintiffs contend Uber is operating a place of public \n25  accommodation that similarly discriminates against persons with disabilities, in violation of \n26  section 12182. \n27 \n28  ORDER GRANTING IN PART AND DENYING IN PART MOTION TO DISMISS \nCASE NO.  17-cv-06124-RS \n3 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-06124-RS   Document 84   Filed 10/03/18   Page 4 of 11\n \n1  A.  Plaintiffs’ Theories for Relief under 42 U.S.C. § 12184  \n2  Section 12184 prohibits discrimination “on the basis of disability in the full and equal \n3  enjoyment of specified public transportation services.” 42 U.S.C. § 12184(a). Under this section, \ndiscrimination includes failure to: (A) make reasonable modifications consistent with section \n4 \n12182(b)(2)(A)(ii); (B) provide auxiliary aids and services consistent with section \n5 \n12182(b)(2)(A)(iii); and (C) remove barriers consistent with sections 12182(b)(2)(A) and \n6 \n12183(a)(2). 42 U.S.C. § 12184(b)(2).  \n7 \n1.  Reasonable Modification under Section 12184(b)(2)(A) \n8 \nAccording to Uber, Plaintiffs fail to state a claim under section 12184 because neither of \n9 \nthem requested a modification of Uber’s polices, practices, or procedures prior to filing suit. \n10 \nUnder section 12184(b)(2)(A), discrimination is defined as failure to make “reasonable \n11 \nmodifications” consistent with the requirements of section 12182(b)(2)(A)(ii). Furthermore, to \n12 \n a\n rtni prevail under section 12182(b)(2)(A)(ii), a plaintiff must show, inter alia, the defendant failed to \nouor 13 \nt Calif make a “requested reasonable modification.” Karczewski v. DCH Mission Valley LLC, 862 F.3d \ncC 14 \ni\nstrof  1006, 1010 (9th Cir. 2017) (quoting Fortyune v. Am. Multi-Cinema, Inc., 364 F.3d 1075, 1082 \nDict  15 \ns ri (9th Cir. 2004). As the Central District of California has noted, the precise meaning of “requested” \net\ntatDis 16 \nd Srn  is not entirely clear. See Galvez v. Auto. Club of S. Cali., No. SA CV 16-0887-DOC, 2017 WL \nee 17 \nnitrth 4586934, at *4 (C.D. Cal. 2017).  \nUo\nN 18 \nIn Fortyune, a wheelchair-using plaintiff asked the defendant movie theater to remove a \n19 \npatron from a designated companion seat so his wife could sit next to him. 364 F.3d at 1078-79. \n20 \nThe movie theater refused. Id. at 1079. The Ninth Circuit noted that “Fortyune asked both [the \n21 \ndefendant] and the district court to ensure that he could be seated next to his wife or another \n22 \ncompanion,” Id. at. 1083, creating ambiguity as to whether the term “requested reasonable \n23 \nmodification” required a pre-suit request or simply referred to the relief sought in the suit itself. \n24 \nSee Galvez, 2017 WL 4586934, at *4. In Karczewski, a paraplegic plaintiff asked the defendant \n25 \ncar dealership temporarily to install vehicle hand controls to enable him to test drive a car. \n26 \nKarczewski, 862 F.3d at 1007. The dealership refused. Id. There, the court proceeded to discuss \n27 \n28  ORDER GRANTING IN PART AND DENYING IN PART MOTION TO DISMISS \nCASE NO.  17-cv-06124-RS \n4 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-06124-RS   Document 84   Filed 10/03/18   Page 5 of 11\n \n1  the reasonableness of the plaintiff’s “requested modification” but did not specifically analyze the \n2  request requirement. \n3  Despite this ambiguity, district courts in the Ninth Circuit have interpreted Karczewski and \n4  Fortyune to require a plaintiff to ask a defendant to change its policy before filing suit. See Razavi \n5  v. Coti, No. 17-cv-04341-BLF, 2018 WL 2867575, at *3 (N.D. Cal. 2018); Galvez, 2017 WL \n6  4586934, at *4; Mannick v. Kaiser Foundation Health Plan, Inc., No. 03-5905-PJH, 2006 WL \n7  2168877, at * 4 (N.D. Cal. 2006). While Plaintiffs need not “say the magic words,” they must \n8  request an accommodation before they claim a defendant has refused to modify its policy, \n9  practices or procedures in violation of 12182(b)(2)(A)(ii). Galvez, 2017 WL 4586934, *4. \n10  The FAC does not allege Plaintiffs requested an accommodation from Uber. Plaintiffs \n11  argue the court can infer the request requirement was satisfied during the mandatory General \n12  Order No. 56 settlement conference between Plaintiffs and Uber. The court, however, is not free to \n a\n rtni\nouor 13  speculate as to a fact not pleaded in the complaint. Rather, the complaint must contain sufficient \nCif\nt al\ncC 14  factual allegations to “state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.” Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678. \ni\nstrof \nDict  15  Accordingly, Plaintiffs have not pleaded sufficient facts to support their reasonable modification \ns ri\net\ntatDis 16  theory under section 12182(b)(2)(A)(ii) via section 12184(b)(2)(A). \nd Srn \nee 17  2.  All Other Theories for Relief under 42 U.S.C. § 12184 \nth\nnirt\nUo\nN 18  While Uber argues Plaintiffs have failed to state a claim under section 12184, it points to \n19  no authority requiring Plaintiffs to make a request for modification prior to suing under the \n20  auxiliary aid provision of section 12184(b)(2)(B), or the removal of barriers provision of section \n21  12184(b)(2)(C). Accordingly, Uber’s motion to dismiss the FAC in its entirety cannot succeed.  \n22  B.  Plaintiffs’ Theories for Relief under 42 U.S.C. § 12182 \n23  Section 12182 prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in the equal enjoyment of \n24  the goods and services of a place of public accommodation. 42 U.S.C. § 12182(a). Plaintiffs \n25  advance two arguments under section 12182 in support of their claim. First, Plaintiffs argue \n26  Uber’s rideshare service qualifies as a place of public accommodation and is therefore subject to \n27  section 12182. Alternatively, Plaintiffs contend Uber’s free rideshare service to the Galantis \n28  ORDER GRANTING IN PART AND DENYING IN PART MOTION TO DISMISS \nCASE NO.  17-cv-06124-RS \n5 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-06124-RS   Document 84   Filed 10/03/18   Page 6 of 11\n \n1  concert bears a close “nexus” to the Galantis concert venue and therefore falls under section \n2  12182. \n3  1.  Uber’s Rideshare Service as a Place of Public Accommodation \n4  Section 12181 provides a list of places of public accommodation. 42 U.S.C. § 12181. \n5  Based on these enumerated locales and the principle of noscitur a sociis, the Ninth Circuit has \n6  held that a place of public accommodation must be an “actual, physical place[] where goods or \n7  services are open to the public.” Weyer v. Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp., 198 F.3d 1104, 1114 \n8  (9th Cir. 2000). Accordingly, websites are not generally considered places of public \n9  accommodation. See Earll v. eBay, Inc., 599 F. App’x 695, 696 (9th Cir. 2015) (unpublished); \n10  Cullen v. Netflix, 600 Fed. App’x 508, 509 (9th Cir. 2015) (unpublished); see also Young v. \n11  Facebook, 790 F. Supp. 2d 1110, 1115-16 (N.D. Cal. 2011). \n12  Uber argues the Uber App, like a website, is not a physical place and therefore does not \n a\n rtni\nouor 13  qualify as a place of public accommodation. Plaintiffs argue Uber’s business does qualify, namely \nCif\nt al\ncC 14  as a “travel service.” 42 U.S.C. § 12181(7)(F). Furthermore, Plaintiffs argue the physical place \ni\nstrof \nDict  15  requirement runs contrary to congressional intent that the ADA be broadly construed, Mary Jo C. \ns ri\net\ntatDis 16  v. New York State and Local Ret. Sys., 707 F.3d 144, 160 (2d Cir. 2013), and point to First Circuit \nd Srn \nee 17  precedent holding that a “travel service” can qualify as a place of public accommodation even if it \nth\nnirt\nUo\nN 18  lacks a physical office space, Carparts Distribution Ctr., Inc. v. Auto. Wholesaler’s Ass’n of New \n19  England, 37 F.3d 12, 19 (1st Cir. 1994). Finally, Plaintiffs contend, Uber’s rideshare service \n20  satisfies the physical place requirement in any event because the service sends physical vehicles to \n21  fetch customers and transport them to their desired location in the material world.  \n22  While “travel service” is listed as a place of public accommodation under section \n23  12181(7)(F), the Ninth Circuit’s binding precedent limits the term “places of public \n24  accommodation” to “actual, physical places.” Weyer, 198 F.3d at 1114. Neither appeals to \n25  congressional intent nor out-of-circuit caselaw can justify a departure from binding precedent. \n26  Therefore, the question remains whether Uber’s transportation services involve an “actual, \n27  physical place[] where goods or services are open to the public.” See Weyer, 198 F.3d at 1114. \n28  ORDER GRANTING IN PART AND DENYING IN PART MOTION TO DISMISS \nCASE NO.  17-cv-06124-RS \n6 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-06124-RS   Document 84   Filed 10/03/18   Page 7 of 11\n \n1  The fact that Uber sends cars to pick up customers at their desired location and drop them \n2  off at different locations is insufficient to qualify Uber’s rideshare service as a place of public \n3  accommodation. In Weyer, the Ninth Circuit referred to insurance offices and book stores as the \n4  types of places where goods or services were open to the public. See Weyer, 198 F.3d at 1113-14. \n5  Neither the street corner where a customer hails a car-for-hire nor the cars themselves fit in the \n6  same category as the locations contemplated by Weyer. Other district court have similarly held \n7  cars, vans, or other types of vehicles do not qualify as places of public accommodation. See, e.g., \n8  Cottrell v. United Parcel Service, No. 16–1689, 2017 WL 1363307, at * 2 (D.N.J 2017); J.H. by \n9  and through Holman v. Just for Kids, Inc., 248 F. Supp. 3d 1210, 1222 (D. Utah 2017). \n10  Accordingly, Plaintiffs cannot show Uber’s transportation service is a place of public \n11  accommodation. \n12  2.  Discrimination in Uber’s Service of the Galantis Concert \n a\n rtni\nouor 13  According to Plaintiffs, even if Uber’s rideshare service does not qualify as a place of \nCif\nt al\ncC 14  public accommodation, it is subject to section 12182 because the lack of wheelchair accessible \ni\nstrof \nDict  15  rideshare options prevented Plaintiffs from enjoying the services of a place of public \ns ri\net\ntatDis 16  accommodation, i.e. the Galantis concert. Uber advances three counterarguments. First, Uber \nd Srn \nee 17  contends the Uber App does not bear a close enough nexus to the Galantis concert to give rise to \nth\nnirt\nUo\nN 18  liability. Second, Uber argues Plaintiffs lack standing to claim discrimination with respect to the \n19  Galantis concert venue. Third, Uber argues the FAC lacks sufficient facts showing Uber operated \n20  the Galantis concert venue. \n21  a.  The Nexus Between Uber’s Rideshare Service and the Galantis Concert \n22  The protections of section 12182 are not limited to the four walls of a place of \n23  accommodation. Rather, section 12182 forbids discrimination in the services of a place of public \n24  accommodation, not just the services offered in the place of public accommodation. 42 U.S.C. \n25  § 12182(a). Thus, the protections of section 12182 may apply where there is nexus between the \n26  service at issue and the physical place of public accommodation. Weyer, 198 F.3d at 1114. In \n27  Weyer, the insurance policy purchased by the plaintiff through his employer did not bear a \n28  ORDER GRANTING IN PART AND DENYING IN PART MOTION TO DISMISS \nCASE NO.  17-cv-06124-RS \n7 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-06124-RS   Document 84   Filed 10/03/18   Page 8 of 11\n \n1  sufficiently close nexus to the physical insurance office to give rise to a claim under section \n2  12182. Id. at 114-15. By contrast, the decision whether to install ramps or elevators to enable \n3  disabled persons to get into an insurance office is closely related to the physical place of public \n4  accommodation. See id. \n5  Applying this rule, the district court in National Fed.’n of the Blind v. Target Corp. held \n6  there was a sufficient nexus between Target.com and the physical Target stores because the \n7  website was “heavily integrated” with, and served as a gateway to, the stores. 452 F. Supp. 2d 946, \n8  955 (N.D. Cal. 2006). In particular, the Target website allowed customers to refill prescriptions, \n9  order photo prints to pick up at the store, print coupons to redeem at the store, purchase many of \n10  the items offered in the store, and find information about store hours and locations. Id. at 949. By \n11  contrast, in Stern v. Sony Corp. of Am., the Ninth Circuit held the plaintiff’s inability to enjoy a \n12  video game due to his disability did not have a sufficient nexus with a marketing event associated \n a\n rtni\nouor 13  with the game. 459 Fed. App’x 609, 611 (9th Cir. 2011) (unpublished). \nCif\nt al\ncC 14  Plaintiffs argue Uber’s rideshare service bears a close nexus to the Galantis concert venue \ni\nstrof \nDict  15  because it was the only way to get to the secret concert location. According to Plaintiffs, this \ns ri\net\ntatDis 16  presents an even more compelling case than does Target because Uber was “quite literally the \nd Srn \nee 17  physical gatekeeper of the concert.” Opp. Mot. Dismiss 15. Uber argues Stern is more instructive, \nth\nnirt\nUo\nN 18  where the nexus between the purportedly inaccessible video game and a promotional event for the \n19  video game was too tenuous. Uber further contends the Galantis concert is better characterized as \n20  a benefit of using Uber, rather than Uber’s rideshare being considered a service of the Galantis \n21  concert. \n22  Practices that prevent disabled persons from physically accessing places of public \n23  accommodation are precisely the sort of activities Weyer described as closely related to a physical \n24  place of public accommodation. Weyer, 198 F.3d at 1114. Furthermore, like in Target, the Uber \n25  App and rideshare service are functioning as a gateway to the Galantis concert venue. Without \n26  access to Uber’s rideshare services, it would be difficult, if not impossible, for Plaintiffs to enjoy \n27  the goods and services offered at the physical Galantis concert venue. Uber’s comparison to Stern \n28  ORDER GRANTING IN PART AND DENYING IN PART MOTION TO DISMISS \nCASE NO.  17-cv-06124-RS \n8 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-06124-RS   Document 84   Filed 10/03/18   Page 9 of 11\n \n1  is inapposite. In Stern, the plaintiff alleged he was unable to enjoy fully the marketing event \n2  because the video game itself was inaccessible, yet, he never claimed he was prevented from \n3  gaining entry to the marketing event due to his disability. According to the FAC and attached \n4  exhibits, Uber’s rideshare service was the only means of gaining access to the Galantis concert. \n5  Therefore Plaintiffs have plausibly alleged Uber’s rideshare service to the Galantis concert bears a \n6  sufficiently close nexus to the physical location to fall within the ambit of section 12182. \n7  b.  Plaintiffs’ Standing with Respect to the Galantis Promotional Concert  \n8  Plaintiffs seek injunctive relief under § 12188. To have standing to seek such relief, \n9  Plaintiffs must plausibly allege a “real and immediate threat of repeated injury” in the future. \n10  Chapman v. Pier 1 Imports, Inc., 631 F.3d 939, 946 (9th Cir. 2011). Plaintiffs’ FAC alleges only \n11  one concert hosted by Uber which they were unable to attend due to lack of wheelchair accessible \n12  options—the Galantis concert. In their opposition to the motion to dismiss, Plaintiffs mention two \n a\n rtni\nouor 13  other parties hosted by Uber in the New Orleans area. Plaintiffs assert that they would participate \nCif\nt al\ncC 14  in Uber’s promotional events and use Uber’s other services if these events and services were made \ni\nstrof \nDict  15  accessible. \ns ri\net\ntatDis 16  A single promotional event does not show a real and immediate prospect that Uber will \nd Srn \nee 17  host more “secret” events which Plaintiffs will be unable to attend. The two other promotional \nth\nnirt\nUo\nN 18  parties mentioned in Plaintiffs’ opposition to the motion to dismiss were not discussed in the FAC \n19  and therefore cannot be considered. Furthermore, Plaintiffs cannot plausible claim they want to \n20  attend Uber’s future promotional events without at least establishing the nature or subject of these \n21  activities. Accordingly, the FAC does not allege sufficient facts to show Plaintiffs plausibly have \n22  standing to seek injunctive relief with respect to Uber’s rideshare service to the Galantis concert. \n23  c.  Whether Uber Operated the Galantis Concert Venue \n24  Even if Plaintiffs had standing with respect to Uber’s rideshare service to the Galantis \n25  concert, the FAC does not plausibly allege Uber operated the Galantis concert venue. The anti-\ndiscrimination provisions of section 12182 only apply to an entity that “owns, leases (or leases to), \n26 \nor operates a place of public accommodation.” 42 U.S.C. § 12182(a). In this context, the term \n27 \n28  ORDER GRANTING IN PART AND DENYING IN PART MOTION TO DISMISS \nCASE NO.  17-cv-06124-RS \n9 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-06124-RS   Document 84   Filed 10/03/18   Page 10 of 11\n \n1  “operate” means to keep in operation, control or direct the functioning of, conduct the affairs of, or \n2  to manage. Pickern v. Pier 1 Imports, 457 F.3d 963, 966 (9th Cir. 2006). A person may \ntemporarily operate a place of public accommodation if the party exercises sufficient control over \n3 \nthe venue and the configuration of facilities with regard to accessibility. Disabled Rights Action \n4 \nComm. v. Las Vegas Events, Inc., 375 F.3d 861, 878 (9th Cir. 2004). \n5 \nPlaintiffs’ FAC alleges Uber “hosted” a secret concert featuring the band Galantis and \n6 \ntherefore operated a place of public accommodation. FAC ¶ 77-80. Plaintiffs, however, provide no \n7 \nfacts indicating Uber controlled the concert venue or facilities, as required under the definition of \n8 \nthe term “to operate.” The allegation Uber “hosted” a concert, without more, is insufficient to \n9 \nsupport a reasonable inference that Uber operated the Galantis concert.  \n10 \nC.  Leave to Amend \n11 \nIf a court dismisses a complaint, it “should grant leave to amend even if no request to \n12 \n a\n ourtorni 13  amend the pleading was made, unless it determines the pleading could not possibly be cured by \nCif\nt al the allegation of other facts.” Lopez v. Smith, 203 F.3d 1122, 1127 (9th Cir. 2000). In making this \ncC 14 \ni\nstrof \nDict  15  determination, the court should consider such factors as “the presence or absence of undue delay, \ns ri\net\ntatDis 16  bad faith, dilatory motive, repeated failure to cure deficiencies by previous amendments, undue \nd Srn  prejudice to the opposing party and futility of the proposed amendment.” See Moore v. Kayport \nee 17 \nth\nnirt\nUo Package Express, 885 F.2d 531, 538 (9th Cir. 1989). \nN 18 \nThe FAC and the briefing related to this motion to dismiss do not indicate bad faith on the \n19 \npart of Plaintiffs. Furthermore, this is the first motion to dismiss entertained in this suit. While it is \n20 \nnot apparent Plaintiff will be able to plead adequately all the theories advanced in the FAC, leave \n21 \nto amend is granted. \n22 \nV. CONCLUSION \n23 \nFor the foregoing reasons, Uber’s motion to dismiss is granted in part and denied in part. \n24 \nIn particular, Plaintiffs’ claim survives under the auxiliary aid provision of section 12184(b)(2)(B) \n25 \nand the removal of barriers provision of section 12184(b)(2)(C). All other theories are dismissed \n26 \nwith leave to amend.

BACKGROUND \n24  Namisnak, Falls, and Miraglia are persons with disabilities who live in New Orleans, \n25  Louisiana. As a result of their physical limitations, they are dependent on electric wheelchairs for \n26  mobility. One service they cannot utilize is Uber’s ride-sharing service, which allows mobile \n27  phone app users to call a car to get from one place to another. Because the Uber App in New \n28  Orleans does not provide an option for riders to call a wheelchair-accessible vehicle, plaintiffs are \n\nCase 3:17-cv-06124-RS   Document 49   Filed 04/13/18   Page 2 of 7\n \n1  unable to use the service. Accordingly, plaintiffs allege, Uber has violated its obligations under the \n2  Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”), the California Disabled Persons Act (“CDPA”), and \n3  the California Unfair Competition law (“UCL”).  \n4  When customers sign up to use Uber’s services, they must first create an account using the \n5  Uber App. The app user’s registration page displays the phrase, “by creating an uber account, you \n6  agree to our terms & conditions and privacy policy,” which is hyperlinked so the registrant may \n7  view the agreement. Creating an account requires the customer to accept Uber’s terms and \n8  conditions, including a mandatory arbitration provision.  \n9  In 2016, Miraglia used a smartphone to access the Uber App and create a rider account. As \n10  part of the registration process, as described above, Miraglia was required to agree to Uber’s terms \n11  and conditions and privacy policy. Uber asserts that Miraglia is bound by the terms of that \n12  agreement and must submit his claims to arbitration pursuant to its arbitration provision.  \n a\n rtni\nouor 13  Falls and Namisnak never downloaded the Uber App or created an Uber account. As a \nCif\nt al\ncC 14  consequence, neither plaintiff manifested agreement to Uber’s terms and conditions or had the \ni\nstrof \nDict  15  opportunity to review any provisions contained therein. Nonetheless, Uber argues that because \ns ri\net\ntatDis 16  plaintiffs rely upon Uber’s terms and conditions in bringing this action, they are equitably \nd Srn \nee 17  estopped from challenging the agreement’s arbitration requirement.  \nth\nnirt\nUo\nN 18  III. LEGAL STANDARD \n19  Uber’s terms and conditions agreement is “a contract evidencing a transaction involving \n20  commerce” subject to the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”). 9 U.S.C. § 2; Chiron Corp. v. Ortho \n21  Diagnostic Sys., Inc., 207 F.3d 1126, 1130 (9th Cir. 2000). “The FAA provides that any arbitration \n22  agreement within its scope ‘shall be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable,’ . . . and permits a party \n23  ‘aggrieved by the alleged . . . refusal of another to arbitrate’ to petition any federal district court \n24  for an order compelling arbitration in the manner provided for in the agreement.” Chiron, 207 \n25  F.3d at 1130 (quoting 9 U.S.C. § 4) (second omission in original). The FAA “leaves no place for \n26  the exercise of discretion by a district court, but instead mandates that district courts shall direct \n27  the parties to proceed to arbitration on issues as to which an arbitration agreement has been \n28  ORDER GRANTING IN PART AND DENYING IN PART MOTION TO COMPEL ARBITRATION \nCASE NO. 17-cv-06124-RS \n2 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-06124-RS   Document 49   Filed 04/13/18   Page 3 of 7\n \n1  signed.” Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. v. Byrd, 470 U.S. 213, 218 (1985) (citing 9 U.S.C. §§ 3, 4). \n2  The role of a district court under the FAA “is therefore limited to determining (1) whether a valid \n3  agreement to arbitrate exists and, if it does, (2) whether the agreement encompasses the dispute at \n4  issue.” Chiron, 207 F.3d at 1130 (internal citations omitted). “If the response is affirmative on \n5  both counts, then the [FAA] requires the court to enforce the arbitration agreement in accordance \n6  with its terms.” Id. \n7  IV. DISCUSSION \n8  “Before a party to a lawsuit can be ordered to arbitrate . . . there should be an express, \n9  unequivocal agreement to that effect. Only when there is no genuine issue of fact concerning the \n10  formation of the agreement should the court decide as a matter of law that the parties did or did not \n11  enter into such an agreement.” Three Valleys Mun. Water Dist. v. E.F. Hutton & Co., 925 F.2d 1136, \n12  1141 (9th Cir. 1991) (internal quotations omitted). In deciding whether there is a genuine issue of fact \n a\n rtni\nouor 13  concerning formation of an agreement, the party opposing arbitration shall receive “the benefit of all \nCif\nt al\ncC 14  reasonable doubts and inferences.” Id. (internal quotations omitted). “When deciding whether the \ni\nstrof \nDict  15  parties agreed to arbitrate a certain matter . . . courts generally . . . should apply ordinary state-law \ns ri\net\ntatDis 16  principles that govern the formation of contracts.” First Options of Chicago, Inc. v. Kaplan, 514 U.S. \nd Srn \nee 17  938, 944 (1995). Under California law, mutual assent is the key to contract formation. See Binder v. \nth\nnirt\nUo\nN 18  Aetna Life Ins. Co., 75 Cal. App. 4th 832, 850 (Ct. App. 1999). In the context of an electronic \n19  consumer transaction, the occurrence of mutual assent ordinarily turns on whether the consumer had \n20  reasonable notice of a merchant’s terms of service agreement. See, e.g., Nguyen v. Barnes & Noble \n21  Inc., 763 F.3d 1171, 1173 (9th Cir. 2014) (“We agree with the district court that Barnes & Noble did \n22  not provide reasonable notice of its Terms of Use, and that Nguyen therefore did not unambiguously \n23  manifest assent to the arbitration provision contained therein.”). \n24  The parties do not dispute that the appearance of a terms and services link on the Uber App \n25  registration screen provided sufficient notice of the arbitration agreement. Rather, Namisnak and Falls \n26  deny being bound by an arbitration agreement to which they did not assent, seeing as neither plaintiff \n27  ever downloaded the Uber App or had the opportunity to review its terms and conditions. Miraglia \n28  ORDER GRANTING IN PART AND DENYING IN PART MOTION TO COMPEL ARBITRATION \nCASE NO. 17-cv-06124-RS \n3 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-06124-RS   Document 49   Filed 04/13/18   Page 4 of 7\n \n1  contends that although he initially agreed to Uber’s terms and conditions, the arbitration provision is \n2  unenforceable against him because he deleted the Uber App. In the alternative, he argues that he \n3  cannot be compelled to submit his claims to arbitration because the defendants named in this action \n4  were not parties to the terms and conditions contract. \n5  A.  Falls and Namisnak \n6  Generally, parties who have not assented to an arbitration agreement cannot be compelled \nto arbitrate under its terms. E.E.O.C. v. Waffle House, 534 U.S. 279, 293 (2002); Volt Info. Sci., \n7 \nInc. v. Bd. of Tr. of Leland Stanford Junior Univ., 489 U.S. 468, 478 (1989) (“the FAA does not \n8 \nrequire parties to arbitrate when they have not agreed to do so”). Having never downloaded the \n9 \nUber App, Falls and Namisnak lacked notice of Uber’s terms and conditions, including its \n10 \nembedded arbitration provision, and never manifested their intention to be bound.  \n11 \nNevertheless, Uber argues that Falls and Namisnak are subject to the arbitration agreement \n12 \n a\n rtni as a matter of California substantive law. “[S]ubstantive federal law [governs] the enforceability of \nouor 13 \nCif\nt al arbitration agreements” but does not “purport[] to alter background principles of state contract law \ncC 14 \ni\nDistrct of  15  regarding the scope of agreements (including the question of who is bound by them).” Arthur \ns ri\ntateDist 16  Anderson LLP v. Carlisle, 556 U.S. 624, 630 (2009). According to Uber, plaintiffs are precluded \nd Srn  from refusing to arbitrate by the doctrine of equitable estoppel, which permits enforcement of an \nee 17 \nth\nUniort arbitration agreement against a nonsignatory under certain circumstances. Id. at 631. In California, \nN 18 \n“[w]hen a plaintiff brings a claim which relies on contract terms against a defendant, the plaintiff \n19 \nmay be equitably estopped from repudiating the arbitration clause contained in that agreement.” \n20 \nJSM Tuscany, LLC v. Superior Court, 123 Cal. Rptr. 3d 429, 443 (Ct. App. 2011). “When that \n21 \nplaintiff is suing on a contract—on the basis that, even though the plaintiff was not a party to the \n22 \ncontract, the plaintiff is nonetheless entitled to recover for its breach, the plaintiff should be \n23 \nequitably estopped from repudiating the contract’s arbitration clause.” Id. When determining \n24 \nwhether equitable estoppel is appropriate, courts must look to the nature of the claims being \n25 \nasserted to determine whether they are “intimately founded in and intertwined with the underlying \n26 \ncontract obligations.” Id. at 442-43. \n27 \n28  ORDER GRANTING IN PART AND DENYING IN PART MOTION TO COMPEL ARBITRATION \nCASE NO. 17-cv-06124-RS \n4 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-06124-RS   Document 49   Filed 04/13/18   Page 5 of 7\n \n1  As Uber views it, plaintiffs’ standing to sue is based on allegations that they would have \n2  used the Uber App but for Uber’s discriminatory policies. Had Falls and Namisnak downloaded \n3  and used the Uber App, they would have been required to agree to Uber’s terms and conditions, \n4  including the arbitration provision. Therefore, Uber reasons, plaintiffs necessarily rely on the \n5  agreement in bringing this suit and should be equitably estopped from avoiding its obligations. \n6  This argument is unpersuasive. The fact that Uber’s terms and conditions are implicated in the \n7  averments of the complaint does not by itself indicate that plaintiffs are claiming some privilege or \n8  benefit derived from Uber’s terms and conditions, or that they are seeking to use the terms and \n9  conditions against Uber.  \n10  The purpose of equitable estoppel is to prevent parties from invoking the terms of a \n11  contract as the basis for suit while avoiding a corresponding contractual obligation to arbitrate. \n12  Goldman v. KPMG LLP, 92 Cal. Rptr. 3d 534, 543-44 (Ct. App. 2009). “The linchpin for \n a\n rtni\nouor 13  equitable estoppel is equity—fairness,” and “the application of the doctrine is fact-specific.” Id. at \nCif\nt al\ncC 14  555 (internal quotations omitted) (quoting Grigson v. Creative Artists, LLC, 210 F.3d 524, 528 \ni\nstrof \nDict  15  (5th Cir. 2000). Falls and Namisnak assert claims against Uber based on rights created by the \ns ri\net\ntatDis 16  ADA, which are not dependent upon or bound up in the terms and obligations of Uber’s service \nd Srn \nee 17  agreement. It is Uber’s alleged refusal to comply with the requirements of the ADA, not the \nth\nnirt\nUo\nN 18  requirements of its consumer agreements, which form the basis of this lawsuit. See Goldman 92 \n19  Cal. Rptr. 3d at 543 (holding that plaintiff signatories were not equitably estopped from refusing to \n20  arbitrate under the terms of an agreement because their “allegations depend solely on the actions \n21  of [defendant nonsignatories], not on the terms of the operating agreements, for their success.”). \n22  Therefore, it does not offend the principles of equity and fairness to conclude that Uber’s \n23  arbitration agreement is not binding upon Falls and Namisnak.  \n24  Uber cannot use its consumer arbitration agreements so expansively as to block all \n25  prospective ADA plaintiffs from seeking relief in federal court. Because Falls and Namisnak never \n26  agreed to arbitrate claims against Uber and are not equitably estopped from refusing to do so, \n27  Uber’s motion to compel arbitration is denied as to their claims.  \n28  ORDER GRANTING IN PART AND DENYING IN PART MOTION TO COMPEL ARBITRATION \nCASE NO. 17-cv-06124-RS \n5 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-06124-RS   Document 49   Filed 04/13/18   Page 6 of 7\n \n1  B.  Miraglia \n2  Unlike Falls and Namisnak, Miraglia does not deny agreeing to Uber’s terms and conditions \n3  when he created an Uber account. Instead, Miraglia contends that he rescinded the agreement by \n4  deleting the Uber App, rendering the agreement’s arbitration clause unenforceable against him. In \n5  response, Uber argues that rescission is an issue of disputed fact that must itself be arbitrated, for \n6  “unless the challenge is to the arbitration clause itself, the issue of the contract’s validity is considered \n7  by the arbitrator in the first instance.” Buckeye Check Cashing, Inc. v. Cardegna, 546 U.S. 440, 445-46 \n8  (2006). Because Miraglia asserts a challenge to the validity of his contract with Uber, not the validity \n9  of the specific arbitration provision contained therein, the question of rescission must go to arbitration. \n10  Alternatively, Miraglia claims that Uber Technologies, Inc. and Raiser, LLC cannot enforce \n11  the arbitration provision against him because they are not parties to the terms and conditions \n12  agreement. The agreement purports to create a contract between the Uber App user and “Uber USA, \n a\n rtni\nouor 13  LLC and its subsidiaries and affiliates (collectively ‘Uber’).” In California, “[a] corporation is an \nCif\nt al ‘affiliate’ of, or a corporation is ‘affiliated’ with, another specified corporation if it directly, or \ncC 14 \ni\nstrof \nDict  15  indirectly through one or more intermediaries, controls, is controlled by or is under common \ns ri\ntateDist 16  control with the other specified corporation.” Cal. Corp. Code § 150.1 Uber explains that Uber \nd Srn  Technologies, Inc. is the parent company that controls Uber USA, LLC and Raiser, LLC. Thus, \nee 17 \nth\nnirt Uber Technologies, Inc. and Raiser, LLC are affiliates of Uber USA, LLC, and parties to the \nUo\nN 18 \narbitration agreement embedded in Uber’s terms and conditions.  \n19 \nMiraglia asserts that defendants in this matter are not affiliated with Uber USA, LLC, \n20 \nbecause that entity does not appear on Uber’s certification of interested entities. See Dkt. No. 12. \n21 \nThe Federal Rules, however, only require Uber to disclose a parent or controlling entity. See Fed. \n22 \nR. Civ. Proc. 7.1. Because Uber Technologies, Inc. is the parent company, it was not required to \n23 \ndisclose Uber USA, LLC. The relevant local rules require disclosure of any entity which has “(i) a \n24 \nfinancial interest of any kind in the subject matter in controversy or in a party to the proceeding; or \n25 \n                                                 \n26 \n1 Uber’s consumer contracts contain a choice of law provision selecting California law. Barajas Decl. \n27  Exh. 1 § 7. \n28  ORDER GRANTING IN PART AND DENYING IN PART MOTION TO COMPEL ARBITRATION \nCASE NO. 17-cv-06124-RS \n6 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-06124-RS   Document 49   Filed 04/13/18   Page 7 of 7\n \n1  (ii) any other kind of interest that could be substantially affected by the outcome of the \n2  proceeding.” Civ. Loc. R. 3-15. Uber denies that Uber USA, LLC has a financial interest or any \nother kind of interest that might be affected by the outcome of this litigation, and Miraglia has \n3 \npointed to no evidence indicating otherwise. Therefore, the failure to list Uber USA, LLC on the \n4 \ncertification disclosure does not demonstrate that Uber USA, LLC, Uber Technologies, Inc., and \n5 \nRaiser, LLC are not affiliates who are all parties to the arbitration agreement that binds Miraglia.  \n6 \nNot only is the arbitration agreement enforceable against Miraglia, his ADA dispute with \n7 \nUber is within the scope of the agreement. The 2016 terms and services arbitration agreement, \n8 \nwhich was in effect when Miraglia created his Uber account, is drafted broadly to cover “any \n9 \ndispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination, \n10 \nenforcement, interpretation or validity thereof or the use of the Services.” Barajas Decl. Exh. 1 § 6 \n11 \n(emphasis added). Miraglia’s ADA claim, which arises out of his inability to access and use \n12 \n a\n rtni Uber’s transportation services, is within the scope of the agreement. Accordingly, Uber’s motion \nouor 13 \nCif to compel arbitration of Miraglia’s claims is granted. \nt al\ncC 14 \ni\nstrof  V. CONCLUSION \nDict  15 \ns ri For the aforementioned reasons, Uber’s motion to compel arbitration is granted as to \net\ntatDis 16 \nd Srn  claims brought by Miraglia, and denied as to claims brought by Falls and Namisnak. \nee 17 \nth\nnirt  \nUo\nN 18 \nIT IS SO ORDERED. \n19 \n \n20 \nDated: April 13, 2018 \n21 \n______________________________________ \n22  RICHARD SEEBORG \nUnited States District Judge \n23 \n \n24   \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28  ORDER GRANTING IN PART AND DENYING IN PART MOTION TO COMPEL ARBITRATION \nCASE NO. 17-cv-06124-RS \n7 ",
