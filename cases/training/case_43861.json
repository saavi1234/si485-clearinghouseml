Defense counsel reports he is unavailable to meet and confer during the time period March 13-19, but he does not explain why he is not available today or tomorrow. Nevertheless, the court will attempt to craft a remedy. Deposition discovery will close on March 15, as presently scheduled, except for the proposed depositions of the Secretary and Under-secretary (only). The parties are ordered to meet and confer by telephone on either March 19 or 20 regarding the depositions. If the parties are unable to agree, they are directed to contact the court for a status conference. The court hopes that will not be necessary, and sanctions may be imposed if the court finds the parties did not confer in good faith. No other deadline is extended as a result of this order, and none will be. Signed by Magistrate Judge Mark L Hornsby on 3/10/2020. (jud,Hornsby, Mark) (Entered: 03/10/2020)"

If video conferencing is not feasible, and these Plaintiffs must be transported in person to the courthouse, counsel are to notify the Court as soon as possible, but no later than May 7, 2021, so that appropriate arrangements can be made. Plaintiffs' counsel has provided Defendants with a proposed consent judgment. Defendants' counsel will respond to that proposal no later than May 7, 2021. Plaintiffs' proposed consent judgment and Defendants' response/counter-proposal must also be provided to the undersigned no later than May 11, 2021.

    "summary": "<p>On February 20, 2018, several individuals incarcerated in extended lockdown at the David Wade Correctional Center (DWCC), represented by the MacArthur Justice Center and Disability Rights Louisiana (the Protection and Advocacy organization in Louisiana), filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Louisiana against the DWCC, the Louisiana Department of Corrections (LDOC), and individual employees in their official capacity. The plaintiffs brought this action under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), the Rehabilitation Act, and 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1983 to remedy violations of the Eighth Amendment, on behalf of a putative class: all others currently held, or who would in the future be held, in extended lockdown in DWCC. The putative subclass was all incarcerated individuals with disabilities related to mental health, or who were perceived as having such disabilities, currently held, or who would in the future be held, in extended lockdown at DWCC. The lawsuit alleged that the defendants violated the plaintiffs' Eighth Amendment constitutional rights by subjecting them to cruel and debilitating conditions, including imposing severe punishment for mentally ill incarcerated individuals. Further, the complaint alleged that the defendants had violated the plaintiffs&rsquo; rights under the ADA and Rehabilitation Act by discriminating against the plaintiffs by failing to provide reasonable accommodations for their disabilities and placing them in extended lockdown, thereby depriving them of adequate mental health care and subjecting them to punishment for disability-related symptoms.</p>\r\n<p>Specifically, the complaint alleged that in the South Compound of the DWCC, people in extended lockdown and solitary confinement were subjected to long periods of little to no external stimuli&mdash;social interaction, books, or fresh air&mdash;in restrictive and unheated cells, without regard for whether the person was already at risk for mental illness, decompensation, or self-harm. The extreme conditions in the South Compound allegedly caused and/or exacerbated mental illness. Some incarcerated people heard voices, engaged in acts of extreme self-harm, or tried to commit suicide while in extended lockdown. The complaint alleged that instead of providing care to the incarcerated people, the staff used restraints and chemical sprays on incarcerated persons and took away access to the outdoor yard, reading materials, mattresses, and clothing. They further alleged that mental health care for people on extended lockdown was inconsistent and poorly administered. The plaintiffs brought the action for injunctive and declaratory relief and attorneys&rsquo; fees.</p>\r\n<p>The case was assigned to Judge Elizabeth E. Foote and Magistrate Judge Karen L. Hayes. Magistrate Judge Mark L. Hornsby replaced Judge Hayes shortly thereafter. From 2018 to 2021, the parties engaged in discovery disputes. On April 30, 2018, the plaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary injunction regarding the creation and potential spoliation of security camera evidence. The court held an evidentiary hearing on the motion in June of that year. In the ensuing report and recommendation, Judge Hornsby recommended that the plaintiffs&rsquo; motion for preliminary injunction be denied because granting it would require the <em>creation </em>of video recordings by the defendant, because the evidence related to individual claims not central to plaintiffs&rsquo; core claims, and because claims of spoliation were not ripe for decision.</p>\r\n<p>Judge Foote issued an order on November 14, 2018, denying the plaintiffs&rsquo; motion for preliminary injunction but declining to adopt the reasoning of the report and recommendation of the Magistrate Judge. Instead, Judge Foote held that at this stage of litigation, before plaintiffs&rsquo; proposed class had been certified, the discovery request was disproportionate. Specifically, the security camera footage was relevant because it could establish that correctional officers were using excessive force as retaliation against potential class members. Thus, the requested footage would be relevant to establishing that retaliation had in fact occurred, which was an issue for a later stage of litigation, i.e., the stage post-class certification.</p>\r\n<p>On January 31, 2019, the plaintiffs filed a motion for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction, after the defendants denied plaintiffs&rsquo; counsel visiting privileges to putative class members. This motion was dismissed as moot on March 8, 2019, after the court ordered the defendants to provide plaintiffs&rsquo; counsel with a reasonable opportunity to conduct interviews with potential class members. The court also granted the defendants&rsquo; January 25, 2019 motion to approve putative class communication, allowing the defendants to speak with incarcerated individuals not currently represented by the plaintiffs&rsquo; counsel.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On March 25, 2019, Anthony Tellis was dismissed as the named plaintiff and representative of the putative class. The plaintiffs then moved to amend their motion for class certification and add the Advocacy Center&mdash;the state&rsquo;s Protection and Advocacy organization&mdash;as a plaintiff to replace Tellis, which the court granted. Before the amended complaint was filed, another plaintiff withdrew from the suit. The court then ordered a settlement conference for September 2019, but due to the posture of the case, settlement negotiations were pushed back to May 2020. In the meantime, on January 13, 2020, the court granted the plaintiffs&rsquo; motion to strike the defendants&rsquo; jury demand, holding that the defendants did not have a constitutional right to a jury trial, and the complexities of the case and the injunctive nature of the relief sought were best suited for a bench trial.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs filed their second amended complaint on March 13, 2020, which added the Advocacy Center and new private plaintiffs to the complaint. A settlement conference in May 2021 was unsuccessful. On June 18, 2021, the defendants filed motions for summary judgment on the plaintiffs&rsquo; ADA and Rehabilitation Act claims and their Eighth Amendment claims, arguing that the plaintiffs lacked factual allegations of discrimination, failure to provide accommodations to the plaintiffs, or serious harm caused by conditions of confinement. The court later denied both motions for summary judgment on January 6, 2022, holding that the plaintiffs had adequately put the defendants on notice as to the factual basis for their claims and had stated a claim for relief. Specifically, the court held that summary judgment on the plaintiffs&rsquo; Eighth Amendment claims would be inappropriate because the defendants had relied on inadmissible evidence&mdash;conditions of confinement after the March 2020 discovery cutoff date&mdash;and the serious issues presented by the plaintiffs&rsquo; evidence would be best determined at the bench trial stage, with a fuller record and ability to cross-examine the parties&rsquo; expert witnesses.</p>\r\n<p>The court concluded the plaintiffs had also sufficiently stated a claim for relief under the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act because the complaint detailed the stories of several incarcerated individuals with ADA-defined disabilities who were not provided accommodations for their mental disabilities and were excluded from programs, such as group counseling and therapy. In addition, the complaint detailed DWCC staff disciplining incarcerated individuals for behavior linked to mental illness, rather than treating such behavior as a mental health symptom. The court found that these allegations stated a claim for relief sufficient to satisfy the summary judgment standard.</p>\r\n<p>Meanwhile, on September 20, 2021, the court granted the plaintiffs&rsquo; motion for class certification. The court certified a class of all prisoners who were or would be subjected to extended lockdown at DWCC and a subclass consisting of all individuals on extended lockdown at DWCC who had or were perceived as having a qualifying disability related to mental health, as defined by the ADA. On October 4, 2021, the defendants filed a motion to stay pending appeal on the class certification ruling, which the court denied on October 13, 2021, writing that the defendants had not shown they were likely to succeed. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit denied the defendants&rsquo; motion for leave to appeal on the grant of class certification on April 26, 2022.</p>\r\n<p>A bench trial began in front of Judge Foote on January 10, 2022. On November 1, 2022, the court issued its opinion, finding that the defendants had violated the Eighth Amendment rights of the class, and the ADA and Rehabilitation Act rights of the subclass. The court found that the conditions in the South Compound of the DWCC rose to the level of an Eighth Amendment violation because of the psychological harms of solitary confinement, the physical composition of the South Compound, the length of time an inmate remained on extended lockdown, the treatment of the mentally ill, and DWCC&rsquo;s disciplinary practices. Further, the court found Eighth Amendment violations in mental health screening and evaluation processes, treatment options (and the lack thereof), the lack of adequate staffing, the lack of safeguards for the administration of psychotropic medications, the inaccuracy and insufficiency of medical records, and the failures of the suicide prevention program. The evidence at trial also supported the plaintiffs&rsquo; ADA and Rehabilitation Act claims that there were no reasonable accommodations in extended lockdown for inmates with mental illness, and that there were no reasonable accommodations related to discipline and use of force on those with mental illness. The court found that the plaintiffs were entitled to injunctive relief. At the remedy phase, the defendants were to show the court that they had instituted effective changes to remedy the violations. Following the remedy phase, the court would grant injunctive relief to the extent any violations had not been cured.</p>\r\n<p>The bench trial on the remedy phase began on January 30, 2023 and concluded on February 9, 2023. On July 18, 2024, the court addressed the remedy phase of the litigation, finding that plaintiffs demonstrated by a preponderance of the evidence that the Eighth Amendment, ADA, and RA violations for which they sought protection had continued since the liability phase of trial and would continue into the future. They reasoned that defendants were continuing to violate the Eighth Amendment rights of the Class through unconstitutional confinement conditions and inadequate mental health services. The court enjoined the defendants from continuing to violate the inmates' Eighth Amendment, ADA and RA rights.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On August 2, 2024, defendants filed a notice of appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. The case is ongoing as of April 2025.</p>",

CIVIL ACTION NO. 18-541   \n \nVERSUS  JUDGE ELIZABETH E. FOOTE \n \nJAMES M. LEBLANC, ET AL.  MAGISTRATE JUDGE HORNSBY \n \nREMEDIAL ORDER \nFor the reasons previously enunciated by the Court,  \nDefendants are hereby ENJOINED from the following: 1) continuing to violate the \nEighth  Amendment rights of all inmates  in extended lockdown—the Class—through  the \nunconstitutional  conditions  of  confinement  and  the  deficient  provision  of  mental  health \nservices; and 2) continuing to violate the rights of inmates with a qualifying mental illness—\nthe Subclass—under Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”) and Section 504 \nof the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (“RA”).  \nDefendants are ORDERED to remedy the constitutional, ADA, and RA violations as \nenumerated by the Court.  \nAdditionally, the Court ORDERS the following remedial measures: \nI.  Special Masters \na.  The Court will appoint three Special Masters: one correctional psychiatrist; one \nindividual  with  experience  working  in  prisons  with  segregated  housing \npopulations; and one individual with knowledge and expertise in disability access \nand accommodations, especially those pertaining to mental health.  \n1 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 755   Filed 07/18/24   Page 2 of 18 PageID #:  55334\nb.  The Special Masters will be appointed to: determine whether there have been any \nchanges at DWCC that cure the Eighth Amendment, ADA, and RA violations \nenumerated by the Court since the August 30, 2022, discovery cut-off date; \ndevelop a remedial plan that is compliant with the below requirements; make \nrecommendations regarding the implementation of the remedial plan; monitor \nthe implementation of the remedial plan; provide periodic status reports to the \nCourt; and ensure the enforcement of the remedial plan in order to cure and \neliminate the constitutional, ADA, and RA violations.  \nc.  The parties shall meet and confer within fourteen days of the signing of this \nremedial  order  to  identify  and  discuss  potential  Special  Masters  with  the \nqualifications set forth herein. Within thirty days of this remedial order, the \nparties shall submit to the Court the names of the proposed Special Masters for \neach position. If the parties are unable to agree on the proposed Special Masters, \neach party will submit to the Court up to three proposed names for each position, \nalong with his/her most recent curriculum vitae.  \nII.

See \nRecord Documents 447, 645, 738, and 745. Defendants contend that the evidence they seek to \nintroduce will prove that the constitutional and statutory violations previously enunciated by \nthe Court have been remedied. It will be the responsibility of the Special Masters to evaluate \nwhether any of the deficiencies have, in fact, been remedied since the August 30, 2022, \ndiscovery cut-off date. The Special Masters shall develop and implement a schedule that sets \n2 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 755   Filed 07/18/24   Page 3 of 18 PageID #:  55335\ndeadlines for this process and to which the parties must comply. Within fourteen days of their \nappointment, Defendants shall provide the Special Masters with any evidence they believe \nproves that the previously enunciated deficiencies have been remedied. Plaintiffs will have the \nright to request additional discovery as to the existence and effectiveness of these alleged \nremedies according to the schedule fashioned by the Special Masters. Plaintiffs will then have \nthe right to submit their own evidence to the Special Masters in accordance with that schedule.  \nIII.

Introduction \nInmates at David Wade Correctional Center (“DWCC”) filed this class action suit \nfor  injunctive  and  declaratory  relief,  challenging  the  conditions  of  confinement  and \ndelivery of mental health services on extended lockdown.1 Defendants are correctional \nofficials  at  DWCC  and  the  Louisiana  Department  of  Public  Safety  and  Corrections \n(“DOC”). Plaintiffs allege that the policies and practices in place at DWCC violate the \nEighth Amendment of the United States Constitution,2 Title II of the Americans with \nDisabilities Act (“ADA”),3 and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (“RA”).4 \nThe Court bifurcated the trial of this matter into a liability phase and a remedy phase. \nThe Court issued an opinion on the liability phase, holding that: 1) Defendants violated the \nEighth Amendment by housing inmates—including those with a diagnosed mental illness–\nin inhumane conditions while on extended lockdown and by failing to provide those \ninmates adequate mental health care; and 2) Defendants have violated the ADA and RA by \nfailing to make reasonable accommodations for inmates with mental disabilities and by \nemploying unlawful methods of administration.  \n \n1 The Court defines “extended lockdown” below. See supra pp. 7-8.  \n2 The Eighth Amendment claim is brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983. Section 1983 \nprovides  a  federal  cause  of  action  for  “the  deprivation  of  any  rights,  privileges,  or \nimmunities secured by the Constitution and laws” of the United States against any person \nacting under color of state law. 42 U.S.C. § 1983. Qualified immunity is not at issue in this \ncase  because  Plaintiffs  only  seek  prospective  equitable  relief—i.e.,  injunctive  and \ndeclaratory relief and not monetary relief—and because Plaintiffs have sued Defendants \nonly in their official capacities. Singleton v. Cannizzaro, 956 F.3d 773, 778 n.3 (5th Cir. \n2020). \n3 42 U.S.C. § 12131, et seq. \n4 29 U.S.C. § 794. \n1 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 754   Filed 07/18/24   Page 4 of 172 PageID #: \n55164\nThis opinion addresses the remedy phase of the litigation. The Court’s task in this \nphase was to determine whether the violations identified in the liability phase were still \noccurring and would continue to occur into the future, and what remedies would eliminate \nthese violations to the extent practicable.  \nFor the reasons below and considering the credible testimony and evidence at trial, \nthe pre- and post-trial briefs, and the stipulations of the parties, the Court finds that \nPlaintiffs have satisfied their burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that \nthe Eighth Amendment, ADA, and RA violations for which they seek protection have \ncontinued since the liability phase of trial and will continue into the future.  \nII.  Procedural Background5 \nAs a reminder, Plaintiffs are  Disability Rights Louisiana (“Disability Rights”) \n(formerly known as Advocacy Center of Louisiana) and a group of inmate representatives \nwho were housed on extended lockdown at DWCC at the time of the lawsuit’s filing—\nBruce  Charles,  Carlton  Turner,  Larry  Jones,  and  Ronald  Brooks—(collectively, \n“Plaintiffs”).  See  Record  Document  316.  Defendants  are  Secretary  James  LeBlanc \n(“Secretary LeBlanc”), Warden Jerry Goodwin (“Warden Goodwin”), Dr. Gregory Seal \n(“Dr. Seal”), Deputy Warden Deborah Dauzat (“Deputy Warden Dauzat”), Steve Hayden \n(“Hayden”), Aerial Robinson (“Robinson”), Johnie Adkins (“Adkins”),6 Vincent Coleman \n(“Coleman”), all in their official capacities; and the DOC.  \n \n5 All of the Court’s findings of fact discussed in the liability phase opinion not explicitly \ndiscussed herein are incorporated.  \n6 During the liability phase of trial, Adkins testified via deposition in lieu of live testimony. \nSee Ex. P-YYY-3 [Record Document 564-258]. At the time, Adkins was the prison \n2 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 754   Filed 07/18/24   Page 5 of 172 PageID #: \n55165\nPreviously, the Court granted Plaintiffs’ motion for class certification. Record \nDocument 462. In doing so, it certified a class of all prisoners who are or will be subjected \nto extended lockdown at DWCC that will pursue the Eighth Amendment claims (the \n“Class”) and a subclass consisting of all individuals on extended lockdown at DWCC who \nhave or are perceived as having a qualifying disability related to mental health—as defined \nby the ADA—that will pursue the ADA and RA claims (the “Subclass”). Id. The Class and \nthe Subclass are represented by the Named Plaintiffs, though the Named Plaintiffs did not \ntestify at either phase of trial.  \nAs stated above, considering the nature and extent of Plaintiffs’ claims, the Court \nbifurcated the matter into two separate phases: liability and remedy. The liability phase \ncame before the Court during a seventeen-day bench trial beginning January 10, 2022. The \nCourt views the liability phase as capturing a snapshot in time during which Eighth \nAmendment, ADA, and RA violations were found to have taken place up through March \n15, 2020. The remedy phase came before the Court during a fourteen-day trial beginning \nJanuary 17, 2023.7 During the remedy phase of trial, the Court heard from twenty-six \nwitnesses—including corrections officials, expert witnesses, and inmates—who testified \n \nchaplain who provided mental health services from a pastoral background and who would \nsometimes conduct the initial intake screening and evaluate inmates on suicide watch. Id. \nat  11:23-12:24,  27:7-16.  Adkins  did  not  testify  during  the  remedy  phase  of  trial. \nFurthermore, none of the parties moved to terminate Adkins as a party, nor did they offer \nany facts or legal arguments about Adkins, his role at DWCC, or the services he may \nprovide to inmates. Plaintiffs have not met their burden in showing that they require \ninjunctive relief from Adkins. Accordingly, all claims against Adkins are DISMISSED \nWITH PREJUDICE. The Court of Clerk is ordered to terminate Adkins as a party. \n7 Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and other logistical issues, the trial was held by Zoom \nvideo conference.  \n3 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 754   Filed 07/18/24   Page 6 of 172 PageID #: \n55166\nregarding the conditions of confinement on extended lockdown at DWCC between March \n15, 2020 (the cut-off date for prison conditions at the liability phase of trial), and August \n30, 2022, and regarding the remedies required to cure those conditions. After trial, the \nCourt permitted the parties to submit post-trial briefs after which the Court took the matter \nunder advisement.  \nIn its liability phase ruling, the Court found not just sporadic instances where the \nconstitutional rights of a particular inmate were violated, but rather systemic deficiencies \nin the policies and procedures that affect all inmates housed on extended lockdown at \nDWCC during that snapshot in time. Specifically, the Court determined that Plaintiffs \nsatisfied their burden of proving that Defendants violated the Eighth Amendment. First, \nthe Court held that the conditions, policies, and practices on extended lockdown—which \nincluded the deprivation of basic psychological needs, social isolation, enforced idleness, \nand conditions of confinement—constituted cruel and unusual punishment. Additionally, \nDefendants were deliberately indifferent in the ways in which they house these inmates, in \nviolation of the Eighth Amendment. Record Document 641 at 60. Second, the Court found \nthere to be systemic deficiencies and deliberate indifference in six areas of mental health \ncare  at  DWCC—screening  and  evaluations,  mental  health  treatment,  staffing,  the \nprescription and distribution of psychotropic medications, record keeping, and the suicide \nprevention program. Id. at 118-124.  \nThe Court also held that Plaintiffs proved that DWCC violated the ADA and RA \nbecause it failed to: 1) consider an inmate’s mental illness before placing him on extended \nlockdown for an indefinite period of time or before employing discipline; 2) modify \n4 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 754   Filed 07/18/24   Page 7 of 172 PageID #: \n55167\nexisting policies or practices for inmates with a mental illness on the South Compound, \nresulting in those inmates’ exclusion from various programs, activities, and services; and \n3) maintain an adequate system by which an inmate may request and obtain reasonable \naccommodations for his qualifying mental illness.8 Id. at 144. In some instances, for those \ninmates in confinement, the Court’s findings as to Plaintiffs’ Eighth Amendment claims \noverlapped with its findings as to Plaintiffs’ ADA and RA claims.  \nDuring the remedy phase of trial, the Court evaluated the current conditions at \nDWCC, which it defined as the time period from March 15, 2020 (the cut-off date for \nprison conditions at the liability phase of trial), through August 30, 2022. See Ex. JR-60 at \n¶ 2; see also Record Document 675 at 3-4. Trial began on January 17, 2023. Thus, only \nfour and a half months elapsed between the August 30, 2022, discovery cut-off date and \nthe beginning of trial. Defendants objected to this time frame and filed four separate \nmotions  to  supplement  the  record  with  evidence  of  current  conditions.  See  Record \nDocuments 447, 645, 738, 745. These motions were filed before and after the remedy phase \nof trial. As the Court explained to the parties, allowing Defendants to introduce evidence \nof new conditions which allegedly remedied the constitutional and statutory deficiencies \nwould necessitate additional discovery and trial testimony, leading to an endless cycle of \ndefense assertions, Plaintiffs’ discovery, and new trial testimony. The Court made it clear \n \n8  Lastly,  the  Court  found  that  Plaintiffs  failed  to  meet  their  burden  in  proving  that \nDefendants opened their outgoing and incoming legal mail or retaliated against them as a \nresult of the information contained therein, in violation of their First Amendment Rights. \nId. at 163. Those claims are therefore DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE.  \n \n5 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 754   Filed 07/18/24   Page 8 of 172 PageID #: \n55168\nthat any improvements made by Defendants after the August 30, 2022, cutoff date will not \nbe ignored by the Court but will serve as evidence of the fulfillment of the injunctive relief \nordered by the Court in its remedial order, which is forthcoming.  \nPursuant to Rule 52(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the Court sets out \nits findings of fact and conclusions of law below. If a fact was controverted, the Court \nweighed the evidence accordingly. \nIII.  Burden of Proof \nThe Court will briefly address the issue of the burden of proof at the remedy phase \nof trial. In a prison injunction case, the jurisprudence instructs that a plaintiff must establish \nthat the defendant officials “knowingly and unreasonably disregard[ed] an objectively \nintolerable risk of harm, and that they will continue to do so . . . during the remainder of \nthe litigation and into the future.” Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 846 (1994); see also \nValentine v. Collier, 993 F.3d 270, 282 (5th Cir. 2021).  \nAs discussed during the pretrial conference before the remedy phase of trial, “[t]he \njurisprudence provides no guidance as to who has this burden when there is a bifurcated \ntrial where the Court has already found constitutional and ADA/RA violations.” Record \nDocument 675 at 5. As such, the Court had to determine which party had the burden of \nproving that the harms alleged by the Plaintiff—and found by the Court during the liability \nphase—existed during the remedy phase of trial and would continue to exist into the future \nwithout the Court’s intervention.  \nThe Court relied upon the Supreme Court’s holding in Farmer, 511 U.S. at 845-46, \nalong with guidance from Judge Dick in Lewis v. Cain, No. 3:15-CV-318 (M.D. La. May \n6 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 754   Filed 07/18/24   Page 9 of 172 PageID #: \n55169\n20, 2015). In Farmer, the Supreme Court held that in demonstrating that harm is likely to \ncontinue and persist in the future, “the inmate may rely, in the district court’s discretion, \non developments that postdate the pleadings and pretrial motions, as the defendants may \nrely on such developments to establish that the inmate is not entitled to an injunction.” 511 \nU.S. at 846. In applying Farmer to the present case, the Court determined that Defendants \nhad the burden of showing that the deficiencies in DWCC’s policies and procedures had \nbeen remedied since the liability phase. At the same time, Plaintiffs had the ultimate burden \nof  demonstrating  that  Defendants’  remedies  were  insufficient  and  failed  to  cure  the \nconstitutional and statutory violations that exist and will continue to exist into the future. \nThis standard is similar to the burden of proof employed in Lewis, a class action \nprisoner civil rights case regarding the provision of adequate medical care at the Louisiana \nState Penitentiary. In that case, which was also bifurcated into liability and remedy phases, \nJudge Dick held that plaintiffs must “prov[e] the need for equitable relief by demonstrating \nthat the unlawful and unconstitutional conditions found following the liability trial persist \nand are likely to persist in the future. To the extent that Defendants have implemented new \npolicies, procedures, or other remedial measures, the Defendants bear the burden of proof.” \nLewis, No. 3:15-CV-318 (M.D. La. May 20, 2015), Record Document 713, p.3. \nIV.  Background Facts \nA. Important Terms \nIn  its  liability  phase  opinion,  the  Court  defined  restrictive  housing,  extended \nlockdown, segregation, and solitary confinement. See id. at 8. Because those terms are used \ninconsistently and interchangeably even within the prison industry, the Court will use the \n7 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 754   Filed 07/18/24   Page 10 of 172 PageID #: \n55170\nterminology in accordance with the stipulations and witness testimony, as it did in the \nliability phase opinion. During the first phase of trial, the parties stipulated that restrictive \nhousing refers to housing prisoners separately from the general population of a correctional \ninstitution and imposing restrictions on their movement, behavior, and privileges. Record \nDocument 524 at ¶ 21. Extended lockdown is a subset of restrictive housing. Id. Extended \nlockdown refers to housing prisoners separately from the general population for twenty-\ntwo or more hours per day in a cell. Id. at ¶ 22. The testimony was not always consistent \nwith regard to the use of this terminology. To clarify, the Court treats solitary confinement \nas a synonym for extended lockdown and segregated housing as a synonym for restrictive \nhousing.  \nThe  Court  also  provided  an  in-depth  explanation  regarding  the  level  of  care \n(“LOC”) designations in its liability phase opinion. See Record Document 641 at 15-18. \nBecause these LOC designations play such a significant role in the provision of mental \nhealth services to inmates on the  South Compound, the  Court will recount  its prior \nexplanation below:  \nInmates designated LOC-1 have a significant disability primarily due \nto their mental health condition. These inmates must be housed in a special \nmental health housing unit with constant monitoring by mental health staff. \nDWCC does not have the capabilities to house inmates classified as LOC-1.  \n  Inmates classified as LOC-2 have been diagnosed with a serious \nmental illness and are presently unstable—that is, inmates with a diagnosed \nserious mental illness who have been in remission for less than six months \nor have displayed a pattern of instability. One example is an inmate on forced \nmedication. Although LOC-2s can be housed at DWCC per policy, the DOC \navoids assigning LOC-2s to DWCC because DWCC lacks the necessary \nresources to safely care for those inmates.  \nInmates  who  have  been  designated  as  LOC-3  have  a  diagnosed \nserious mental illness but have been in remission or stable for at least six \n8 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 754   Filed 07/18/24   Page 11 of 172 PageID #: \n55171\nmonths. Stable means “there are not symptoms that are disrupting your \nfunctioning at that point in time.” In other words, the inmate can function \ndespite having some symptoms—potentially by developing coping skills. Dr. \nGregory Seal (“Dr. Seal”), DWCC’s contract psychiatrist, described stable \nas meaning “unchanging,” which indicates that the treatment is working.  \nLOC-4 is assigned to inmates who are diagnosed with mental illness \nand may be taking medication but are not diagnosed with a serious mental \nillness. . . . LOC-5 simply means the inmate does not have mental health \nissues. . . . DWCC typically only houses inmates designated as LOC-3, -4, \nor -5. LOC-3s and -4s comprise most of the mental health caseload at \nDWCC.  \nId. at 15-17 (internal citations omitted). When the Court discusses a LOC designation, the \nCourt is relying upon this description.  \nB. DWCC Overview \nDWCC is a maximum-security institution located in Claiborne Parish, Louisiana. \nId. at ¶ 26. The South Compound is comprised of five buildings, four of which—N-1, N-\n2, N-3, and N-4—are the subject of this litigation. Ex. JR-60 at ¶ 6 [Record Document 715-\n54]. Each building is made up of four tiers—A, B, C, and D. Id. Each tier has sixteen cells, \nthe first two of which are camera cells that allow for the observation of inmates on suicide \nwatch. Id. All of the cells located in N-4C are also camera cells. Id. All inmates housed in \nN-1D, N-2D, and N-4 are housed in single bunked cells; every tier contains cells that can \ndouble bunk inmates. Id. There have been some changes to the overall structure of the tiers \nat DWCC, which the Court will briefly enumerate below. \ni.  N-1 \nPrisoners in the N-1 tier are classified as “medium custody,” though as will be \ndiscussed in greater depth, there are conflicting expert opinions regarding whether the \nDWCC inmates housed in those dorms are living a true medium custody lifestyle. Pacholke \n9 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 754   Filed 07/18/24   Page 12 of 172 PageID #: \n55172\nLiability Trial Tr. vol. VIII at 609:23-610:1 [Record Document 542]. It could be regarded \nas a transitional unit. Burns Remedy Trial Tr. vol. VII at 1611:15-19 [Record Document \n710]. As of August 30, 2022, N-1 housed sixty-four beds, Ex. JR-60 at ¶ 13 [Record \nDocument 715-54], a fifty percent reduction from the liability phase of trial because the \nprison no longer double bunks the cells, Ex. J-21 at 9 [Record Document 565-49]. There \nare televisions on the tier, and prisoners are allowed to maintain personal possessions in \ntheir cell, including tablets. Ex. JR-60 at ¶ 16 [Record Document 715-54]. The tablets can \nbe used to make phone calls; prisoners without a tablet are allowed at least sixteen calls \nper  month.  Id.  at  ¶  22.  In  the  afternoons,  Plaintiffs  are  allowed  to  attend  group \nprogramming, eat their meals in the dining area, and are allowed two hours of exercise per \nday on the yard. \nii.  N-2A, N-2B, N-3, and N-4 \nInmates housed in the N-2A, N-2B, N-3, and N-4 tiers are classified in one of the \nfollowing  “maximum  custody”  groups:9  investigative  segregation,  disciplinary \n \n9 Inmates on investigative segregation are held in segregated housing for approximately \nseventy-two hours as  they await a disciplinary hearing for a rule infraction.  Record \nDocument 641 at 13 (citing Baird Liability Trial Tr. vol. XIV at 1059:13-19 [Record \nDocument 555]). If they are found to be guilty, inmates should be sentenced to disciplinary \nsegregation for a period prescribed by the disciplinary matrix. Id. As the Court will describe \nin greater depth, the disciplinary matrix is a new implementation by DWCC as of July \n2022.  After  an  inmate  completes  his  sentence  on  disciplinary  segregation,  he  may \nnonetheless  remain  on  extended  lockdown  in  preventative  segregation,  an  indefinite \nassignment without objective criteria for removal.

JR-60 at ¶ 7 [Record Document 715-\n54]. Inmates housed in these tiers are confined to their cells for twenty-three hours per day \nduring the week and twenty-four hours per day during the weekend. Id. at ¶ 9. There are \n128 single bunked dorms in N-311 and N-4; N-2A and N-2B also have the capacity to be \ndouble bunked. Ex. JR-60 at ¶ 6, 10 [Record Document 715-54]. Inmates housed in these \ntiers are allowed to spend ten dollars per week at the canteen and do not have access to \ntelevisions, radios, radio cassettes, CD players, or AM/FM tuners. Ex. JR-25 at 6-7 [Record \nDocument 715-20]; see also, Ex. JR-26 at 3 [Record Document 715-21]. They are allowed \nfour, fifteen-minute phone calls per month, Ex. JR-60 at ¶ 20 [Record Document 715-54], \nand one hour of exercise in the restrictive recreational area five times per week, id. at ¶ 9. \nInmates are permitted no-contact visits on the weekends. Id. at ¶ 19.  \niii.  N-2C \nInmates housed in the N-2C tier are assigned to working segregation, typically for \na period of forty-five to ninety days. Ex. JR-60 at ¶¶ 13, 15 [Record Document 715-54]. \nWorking segregation is a new inmate classification at DWCC that has been implemented \nsince the liability phase of trial. Id. at ¶ 4. It could also be considered a transitional program \nto general population. Burns Remedy Trial Tr. vol. VII at 1580:5-20 [Record Document \n710]. There are thirty-two beds in this tier. Ex. JR-60 at ¶11 [Record Document 715-54]. \n \n10 The classifications have not changed since the liability phase of trial. As the Court \nexplained in its first opinion, DWCC implemented a new classification policy, which \naltered some of the terminology used in restrictive housing.  \n11 Though N-3 has the capacity to be double bunked, the parties stipulated that the dorms \nare now single bunked. Ex. JR-60 at ¶¶ 6-10 [Record Document 715-54]. \n11 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 754   Filed 07/18/24   Page 14 of 172 PageID #: \n55174\nIndividuals on this tier are permitted to possess radios, cassette tape players, or CD players \nand may purchase receivers to listen to the television on the tier. Id. at ¶ 15. Inmates here \nare permitted to eat in the dining hall, exercise in the non-restrictive recreational area for \ntwo hours per day, and attend group programming Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays for \ntwo hours and forty-five minutes. Id. Inmates assigned to working segregation are not \nactually assigned a job; instead, they attend their group programming and enjoy increased \naccess to yard time. Coleman Remedy Trial Tr. vol. I at 24:16-20 [Record Document 704]. \nThey are also permitted to attend religious services. Id. Inmates on working segregation \nmay spend forty dollars per week at the canteen. Id.  \niv.  N-2D \nInmates housed in the N-2D tier are assigned to CCR protective segregation. Ex. \nJR-60  at  ¶  7  [Record  Document  715-54].  Protective  segregation  is  a  non-punitive \nclassification  that  is  meant  to  protect  inmates  for  health  or  safety  reasons.  Record \nDocument 641 at 11 (citing Ex. J-3 at 8 [Record Document 564-285]). There are sixteen \nbeds in N-2D. Id. at ¶ 12. Inmates on CCR are in their cells for over twenty-two hours per \nday. Record Document 641 at 11. Inmates who are housed in N-2D for more than ninety \ndays are allowed one contact visit per month. Ex. JR-60 at ¶ 19 [Record Document 715-\n54]. Inmates on CCR are permitted to possess a radio, cassette tape player, or a CD player. \nEx. JR-26 at 6 [Record Document 715-21]. Inmates in CCR are permitted to possess \ntablets. Goodwin Remedy Trial Tr. vol. XI at 2588:6-9 [Record Document 717]. However, \nas of the remedy phase of trial, the N-2D tier did not possess wireless internet, making the \n12 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 754   Filed 07/18/24   Page 15 of 172 PageID #: \n55175\ntablets not functional.

Id. at 2559:6-9.  As the Court \nmentioned in the liability opinion, Secretary LeBlanc is the final policy maker for the DOC \nand is responsible for establishing policies and practices related to the mental health care \nservices provided to prisoners in its custody. Record Document 641 at 18-19 (citing Record \nDocument 524 ¶ 144; Secretary LeBlanc Liability Trial Tr. vol. XI at 2562:18-22 [Record \nDocument 545]). Secretary LeBlanc was polished and politic.  \nSeth Smith (“Chief Smith”) serves as the Chief of Operations for the DOC and \nreports to Secretary LeBlanc. Smith Remedy Trial Tr. vol.

Chief Smith directly supervises Blake LeBlanc and Warden \nGoodwin. Smith Remedy Trial Tr. vol. VII at 1433:7-11 [Record Document 710]. As Chief \nof Operations, Chief  Smith oversees  all of  the DOC’s adult facilities, mental health \ndepartments, and medical departments, among other departments and functions within the \n13 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 754   Filed 07/18/24   Page 16 of 172 PageID #: \n55176\nDOC. Id. at 1432:20-1433:3.12 The Court found Chief Smith to be forthcoming in his \ntestimony. He was professional and demonstrated a genuine concern for the well-being of \ninmates. \nBlake LeBlanc13 is the Mental Health Director for the DOC and has served in that \ncapacity  since  March  2020.  Blake  LeBlanc  Remedy  Trial  Tr.  vol.  VI  at  1311:7-10, \n1313:13-16 [Record Document 709]. He has his undergraduate degree in psychology, a \nmaster’s degree in social work, is a licensed clinical social worker, and is a board approved \nclinical supervisor. Id. at 1311:13-1312:14. His job responsibilities include reviewing \ndepartmental  mental  health  policies  and  procedures  to  ensure  compliance  with  the \nAmerican Correctional Association’s (“ACA”) standards; coordinating inmate transfers for \nmental health purposes; consulting with facilities on “difficult cases;” reviewing parts of a \nfacility’s C-05 reporting;14 hosting quarterly meetings with mental health directors from \nthe DOC’s facilities; and serving on the Governor’s drug policy advisory board. Id. at \n1314:6-1315:8. Blake LeBlanc’s credibility was hurt by his defense of the DOC even in \nthe face of obvious systemic deficiencies. For example, he insisted that Hayden—who has \na master’s degree in industrial and organizational psychology, and who lacks any mental \n \n12 Chief Smith assumed oversight responsibility over the DOC’s medical and mental health \ndepartments  around  May  2022.

Id. at 1433:4-6.  \n13 To prevent confusion with Secretary LeBlanc, the Court will refer to Blake LeBlanc \nusing his full name. Secretary LeBlanc and Blake LeBlanc do not appear to be related to \none another. \n14 As the Court will explain further, a C-05 report is a monthly report, submitted to the \nDOC by its institutions’ wardens, that summarizes activity and other unusual occurrences \nat their institutions. See e.g., Ex.

VIII at 1746:12-1747:10 [Record Document 722]. Warden \nGoodwin is a long-time DWCC employee ensconced in the DOC system. His testimony \nwas well-prepared and coached by counsel. Nevertheless, the Court was surprised by \nWarden Goodwin’s lack of general knowledge on the processes and policies at DWCC.16 \n \n15 The Court learned from another case before it that Warden Goodwin is no longer the \nwarden at DWCC. See Labit, et al., v. LeBlanc, et al., No. 5:22-cv-00371.  \n16 The Court notes that during twenty-four distinct lines of questioning, Warden Goodwin \nresponded that he did not know the answer to a question asked by counsel. See Goodwin \nRemedy Trial Tr. vol. VIII at 1753:6, 1769:1, 1773:14, 1826:21, 1851:24, 1864:1 [Record \nDocument 722]; Goodwin Remedy Trial Tr. vol.

For example, Warden Goodwin did not disclose the existence \nof this litigation to the ACA during its April 2022 audit of DWCC. See Goodwin Remedy \nTrial Tr. vol. IX at 1932:8-1935:16 [Record Document 712]. Indeed, in response to a direct \nquestion during the audit as to whether there was ongoing litigation involving DWCC, \nWarden Goodwin answered that there had been no hearings, despite the four-week liability \nphase trial having taken place only a few months before. Id. Warden Goodwin’s lack of \ncandor with the ACA undercuts not only his own credibility, but also the credibility of \nDWCC’s ACA certification.  \nDeputy Warden Dauzat has served as deputy warden over the operations of mental \nhealth since January 2020 and has worked with the DOC since 1999.17 Dauzat Liability \nTrial Tr. vol.

Dauzat Liability Trial Tr. vol. XV at 3304:21-3305:3 [Record \nDocument 556]. The Court found Deputy Warden Dauzat to be very professional. She \nattempted to answer the questions to the best of her ability. She was a credible witness—\nthough at times not fully informed of the processes at DWCC—and demonstrated a genuine \nwillingness to learn and grow from this process.  \nAssistant  Warden  Sherman  has  served  as  the  Assistant  Warden  over  the \nclassification, education, and re-entry departments since March 2020. Sherman Remedy \nTrial Tr. vol. II at 333:13-340:7 [Record Document 705]. She supervises the ARDC \nspecialists, or classification officers. Id. at 333:22-24. Assistant Warden Sherman holds a \nbachelor’s degree in psychology and a master’s degree in counseling. Id. at 339:12-13. \nBefore assuming her current role, Assistant Warden Sherman worked in DWCC’s mental \nhealth department, served on a central risk review panel and a sex offender assessment \npanel, and was responsible for re-entry services. Id. at 339:25-340:8. Assistant Warden \nSherman answered the questions honestly and to the best of her ability, but she seemed to \nlack knowledge of material components of her role. For example, although she supervises \nthe ARDC specialists, Assistant Warden Sherman could not enunciate what ARDC stands \nfor. Id. at 333:25-334:2.  \nAssistant Warden Acklin oversees records, pre-classification, and human resources, \nand she serves as the ADA Coordinator.18 Ex.

Assistant  Warden  Acklin’s \nresponsibilities as ADA Coordinator include “receiv[ing] any concerns an offender may \nhave or an employee may have concerning any accommodations that they think may be \nneeded for them to live or work [at DWCC].” Id. at 11:13-17. While the Court found some \nof her contextual testimony to be helpful, Assistant Warden Acklin lacked knowledge of \nthe ADA-required policies and procedures. \nAssistant Warden Tyrone Mays (“Assistant Warden Mays”) oversees security at \nDWCC.

Hayden was slightly more \nresponsive in his testimony during this phase of the proceedings than he was in the first, \nsee Record Document 641 at 22 nn. 22-25, but was still defensive, evasive in his responses, \nand had to be admonished to answer questions.21  \nJames Burgos (“Burgos”) is a professional counselor at DWCC, having served in \nthat capacity since before March 2020.

Id. at 689:10-25. Since September 2022—after the discovery \ncutoff date—Burgos became responsible for N-3 and N-4 tiers. Id. at 690. Burgos was \nprofessional and demonstrated a genuine care for the inmates and a willingness to learn \nfrom this process but the Court determined that he does not challenge status quo policies \nand procedures that are below the requisite standard.  \nRobinson is a social worker at DWCC, where she has worked since September 2016. \nRobinson Remedy Trial Tr. vol. IX at 2026:23-2027:11 [Record Document 712]. Robinson \nholds bachelor’s and master’s degrees in social work and is a licensed clinical social \nworker. Id. at 2027:5-9. Robinson is primarily responsible for H-1, H-2, and H-5, and is \navailable to provide support on the South Compound as needed. Id. at 2028:6-16. She also \nis responsible for creating the heat duty status lists, LOC-3 lists, and she compiles an \ninmate’s  medical  records  ahead  of  his  psychiatric  appointment  with  Dr.  Seal.  Id.  at \n2029:13-19,  2031:11-2032:3,  2036:8-15.  Hayden  directly  supervises  Robinson.  Id.  at \n2027:14-15. Robinson was professional and demonstrated a genuine care for DWCC’s \ninmates. For example, Robinson seems to demonstrate a higher caliber of documenting \ninmate interactions. However, like Burgos, Robinson appears to focus solely on complying \nwith current policies and procedures as to DWCC’s provision of mental health care without \nany challenge to those status quo policies and procedures that are below the requisite \n \n23 The “H” tiers are located on the North Compound, which is not at issue in the present \naction.  \n20 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 754   Filed 07/18/24   Page 23 of 172 PageID #: \n55183\nstandard.  She also seems unaware  of how  her actions and responsibilities  affect  the \nprisoners. For example, even though she creates the lists for those on heat duty status and \nfor those classified as LOC-3 and provides those lists to the key room officers, she did not \nknow how these lists were used, if at all. \nDr. Seal is the contract psychiatrist for DWCC. Seal Remedy Trial Tr. vol. III at \n617:18-20 [Record Document 706]. Dr. Seal is board-certified in general psychiatry, \nhaving received his medical degree from Louisiana State University School of Medicine \nin Shreveport and completed his residency at the United States Air Force’s Wilford Hall \nMedical Center. Seal Liability Trial Tr. vol. XVII at 3844:6-25 [Record Document 561]. \nDr. Seal has been performing contract psychiatry for the DOC since 2009. Id. at 3848:25-\n3849:3. In early 2021, Dr. Seal’s contracted hours increased from eight in-person hours \nevery other week to four hours of telemedicine twice a week. Seal Remedy Trial Tr. vol. \nIII at 618:19-620:25 [Record Document 706]. The Court finds that Dr. Seal’s credibility \nwas called into question after he falsely testified about his schedule and how many days he \nworks. The evidence showed that he had failed to fulfill the terms of his contract and had \nnot worked the requisite shifts and/or hours per week. See ex. id. at 621:3-622:14, 631:7-\n632:5.  Dr.  Seal  perceives  his  duties  as  limited  to  seeing  the  inmates  for  their  brief \nappointments with him in which he only prescribes medicine. He does not take any \ninitiative or responsibility for areas outside of these visits that would impact his patients’ \nquality of care. For example, as this Court will enunciate in greater depth, he had no \nknowledge of the conditions of segregated housing nor of the conditions of treatment \n21 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 754   Filed 07/18/24   Page 24 of 172 PageID #: \n55184\nsegregation. Moreover, he did not know what other modalities of mental health treatment, \nif any, were available to his inmate patients.  \nColeman is the security colonel for the South Compound at DWCC, having assumed \nthat role in May 2020. Coleman Remedy Trial Tr. vol. I at 15:22-16:3 [Record Document \n704]. He has worked at DWCC since 2002, working himself up to the position of security \ncolonel from cadet. Id. at 1539:20-22. In his capacity as security colonel, Coleman oversees \nall security personnel in the N-1, N-2, N-3, and N-4 buildings; he is supervised by Assistant \nWarden Mays. Coleman Remedy Trial Tr. vol. I at 16:4-10 [Record Document 704]. \nDuring trial, Coleman’s responses were focused on his responsibilities as they relate to \nDWCC’s security and operations to the point that he appeared to actively ignore what else \nmay be going on around him. In his view, his responsibility is limited solely to security \noperations; any issues of how security affects those inmates experiencing mental health \nissues are not his responsibility or concern. Additionally, he failed to appreciate the impact \nof mental illness on an inmate’s behavior. He exhibited a greater amount of knowledge of \nthe mental health department during his remedy phase testimony than his liability phase \ntestimony. Coleman was well-prepared by counsel and relied on stock/conclusory answers \nto many questions. One example of this was Coleman’s repeated use of the phrase “safety \nand stability of the institution” in replying to questioning without any further context or \nexplanation. Id. at 121:10-11.   \nRyan Kimball (“Kimball”) is an ARDC specialist and classification officer for all \nprisoners housed in the N-1, N-2, N-3, and N-4 buildings, having served in that position \nsince October 2020. Kimball Remedy Trial Tr. vol.

Id. at 189:15-17. ARDC specialists are \nprimarily responsible for “assist[ing] in the stability of the institution through proper \nplacement of prison housing jobs and custody status.” Id. at 189:11-13. Kimball appeared \nto have a genuine concern for inmate well-being. However, he did not challenge the status \nquo when it fell below the requisite standards. His testimony was couched in statements of \nwhat he specifically does or what “could happen,” but he was unable to enunciate the \nrequired processes as outlined by policy or what standard procedure is at DWCC. For \nexample, Kimball testified that during a meeting before the classification review board, he \ntypically does not look past one year’s worth of rule violations reports (“RVRs”) when \nconsidering an inmate’s assignment; however, he was not able to point to a specific written \npolicy governing this process. Kimball Remedy Trial Tr. vol.

Prior to assuming his \ncurrent role, Nail served as the colonel over the South Compound.24 Id. at 143:5-7. In total, \nNail has been employed at DWCC for over thirty years in different capacities. But, during \nhis testimony, Nail demonstrated an unfamiliarity with DWCC policies and procedures, \n \n24 Nail explained that he worked for DWCC from 1991 to 2019, when he left the DOC. \nNail Remedy Trial Tr. vol. I at 143:15-17. He began working for DWCC again in March \n2020, coming back in a “worked as employed” capacity.

The Court found Nail’s \ntestimony to be illustrative of the culture of DWCC’s long-time employees—he was \ndefensive,  evasive  in  his  responses,  and  was  admonished  by  the  Court  to  answer \nquestions.25  \nMichelle Norris (“Norris”) is the Director of Nursing at DWCC and has occupied \nthat role since late 2020.26 Ex.

These officers are \nnew to their roles since the liability phase of trial.  \nD. Expert Witnesses \nThe Court was aided by the testimony of the same five expert witnesses who \ntestified at the liability phase of trial: Dan Pacholke, Dr. Craig Haney, and Dr. Kathryn \nBurns served as Plaintiffs’ experts, while Dr. John Thompson and James Upchurch served \nas Defendants’ experts.29 This section provides a brief introduction to each expert, their \nmethodology, and the Court’s impressions of their testimony.   \ni.  Dan Pacholke \nDan Pacholke (“Secretary Pacholke”) appeared as an expert for Plaintiffs. Secretary \nPacholke’s qualifications and curriculum vitae have not materially changed since the \nliability  phase  of  trial.  Secretary  Pacholke  worked  in  prison  operations  with  the \nWashington State Department of Corrections for over thirty-three years, serving in various \ncapacities including Superintendent, Director of the Prisons Fivision, and even Secretary \nof the Washington State Department of Corrections. Pacholke Liability Trial Tr. vol.

II at 451:6-8 [Record Document 705].  \nIn preparing his remedy phase expert report, Secretary Pacholke reviewed a “wide \nrange” of documents, including institutional and departmental policies on segregation, \nDWCC post  orders,  C-05 reports, classification review  board forms, inmate records, \ntraining documents, and new inmate orientation materials. Pacholke Remedy Trial Tr. vol. \nII at 454:18-455:4 [Record Document 705]. He also conducted a three-day site visit to \nDWCC in June 2022. Id. at 455:5-18. During that visit, Secretary Pacholke visited “all \nplaces where an inmate in segregation might be.” Id. at 455:19-23. Those places include \nthe visiting area, infirmary, cells, recreation area, and almost all tiers on the N-1, N-2, N-\n3, and N-4 units. Id. at 455:23-456:6. Secretary Pacholke testified that he spoke to forty-\ntwo inmates at the cell-front and twelve inmates in a one-on-one setting; these inmates \nwere chosen from “all types of segregated housing.” Id. at 456:7-15.  \nThe Court found Secretary Pacholke to be  a credible  expert witness. He was \nforthright,  did  not  shy  away  from  or  attempt  to  avoid  answering  questions,  and \ndemonstrated extensive knowledge and expertise regarding a wide breadth of authorities \nin his designated area.  \nii.  Dr. Craig Haney \nCraig Haney, Ph.D., J.D., (“Dr. Haney”), appeared as an expert for Plaintiffs. At \nboth the liability and remedy phases of trial, the Court accepted Dr. Haney as an expert in \n26 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 754   Filed 07/18/24   Page 29 of 172 PageID #: \n55189\nsocial psychology30 and solitary confinement.

Dr. Haney holds a Ph.D. in psychology from Stanford University \nand a J.D. from Stanford Law School.31 Haney Liability Trial Tr. vol. XII at 2846:16-23 \n[Record Document 553]. He has been a Professor of Psychology at the University of \nCalifornia at Santa Cruz for over forty years, specializing in the intersection of psychology \nand law, and has published articles on the topics of solitary confinement and imprisonment \nthroughout his career. Id. at 2847:24-2851:7.  \nDr. Haney visited DWCC in late June 2022 to assist in the preparation of his expert \nreport. He visited the South Compound units—including N-1, N-2, N-3, and N-4—the \nvisiting area, and the infirmary. Haney Remedy Trial Tr. vol. X at 2178:25-2179:15 \n[Record  Document  713].  Dr.  Haney  conducted  thirty-four  cell-front  interviews  with \ninmates  chosen  at  random,  id.  at  2179:19-25,  and  eleven  confidential,  individual \ninterviews,  see  PR-AA-1  ¶¶  87-102  [Record  Document  716-159].  Of  those  eleven \nindividuals, three were follow-up interviews with inmates Dr. Haney had seen in 2019 and \neight were chosen from the cell-front interviews. Id. at ¶¶ 87, 91; see also, Haney Remedy \n \n30 As explained in the liability phase opinion, social psychology “is the study of how people \nare changed and affected by the settings or the situations or the environments in which they \nfind themselves, and we study a range of different kinds of environments.” See Record \nDocument 641 at 25-26 (citing Haney Liability Trial Tr. vol.

However, his practice in prison settings has been very limited, and he has not \nperformed personal research on the questions at issue in this lawsuit.  \nIn this remedy phase of trial, Dr. Thompson spent most of his testimony quarrelling \nwith the Court’s fact findings from the liability phase ruling. Specifically, during the \nliability phase of trial, Dr. Thompson took the position that long-term stays on extended \nlockdown do not have any adverse psychological effects on prisoners, whether or not they \nsuffer from a mental illness. In its liability phase opinion, the Court weighed the expert and \nfact testimony and found to the contrary. But Dr. Thompson’s testimony in the remedy \nphase continued to argue his prior position. He had to be reminded by the Court that the \nissue had been decided. These considerations, as well as Dr. Thompson’s lack of expertise \nand experience as compared with Plaintiffs’ experts, affected the weight that the Court \ncould afford his testimony in this case.  \nv.

Upchurch Remedy Trial Tr. vol. XII at 2713:11-15 [Record \nDocument  719].  During  that  visit,  Upchurch  spent  much  of  his  time  on  the  South \nCompound, touring the N-1, N-2, N-3, and N-4 tiers and their exercise areas, and testified \nthat he was able to observe Hayden’s mental health intake process, a meeting of the \nclassification review board, and a meeting of the multi-disciplinary review board. Id. at \n2713:16-2714:10, 2721:19.

Ex. DR-7 at 3-6 [Record Document \n718-3]. \nThe Court did not find Upchurch to be a reliable expert witness. Upchurch stumbled \nthrough testimony, rambled, could not locate pages within his own report, and gave the \n33 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 754   Filed 07/18/24   Page 36 of 172 PageID #: \n55196\noverall impression that he was unfamiliar with basic processes and procedures at DWCC. \nFor example, Upchurch indicated that he attended what he thought could have been the \ninitial classification boards for inmates, though he was not sure of the nature of those \nmeetings  he  attended  and  thought  they  were  perhaps  a  meet-and-greet  with  Warden \nGoodwin.  See  Upchurch  Remedy  Trial  Tr.  vol.  XII  at  2729:2-2731:18  15  [Record \nDocument 719]. As such, the Court was unable to determine what kind of  meeting \nUpchurch attended. Certainly, there was no testimony by any other witness—for the \nPlaintiffs or the Defendants—that there is a meet-and-greet with Warden Goodwin as part \nof the intake process. Upchurch’s testimony is telling as to both his lack of understanding \nof the procedures at DWCC and as to the unstructured nature of the initial classification \nboard meetings. The Court also notes that Upchurch’s background is highly centered upon \nprison operations, and more specifically, prison security, and as a result, the Court found \nthat he had little insight into the mental health aspect of this case.  \nV.  Eighth Amendment Claims \nA. Eighth Amendment Standard \nPlaintiffs bring their Eighth Amendment claims pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983.34 \n“Central to all other corrections goals is the institutional consideration of internal security \n \n34 Section 1983 provides a federal cause of action for “the deprivation of any rights, \nprivileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws” of the United States against \nany person acting under color of state law. 42 U.S.C. § 1983. Section 1983 does not create \nsubstantive rights but provides remedies to the rights established in the United States \nConstitution and other federal laws. See Graham v. Connor, 490 U.S. 386, 393-94 (1989); \nCity of Okla. City v. Tuttle, 471 U.S. 808, 816 (1985). To assert a claim for damages under \nthis statute, a plaintiff must demonstrate “(1) a deprivation of a right secured by federal \n34 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 754   Filed 07/18/24   Page 37 of 172 PageID #: \n55197\nwithin the corrections facilities themselves.” Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 546-47 (1979) \n(quoting Pell v. Procunier 417 U.S. 817, 823 (1974)). Prison officials are afforded wide \ndiscretion “in the application of policies and practices designed to maintain security and \npreserve internal order.” McCord v. Maggio, 910 F.2d 1248, 1251 (5th Cir. 1990). This \nincludes separating inmates from other inmates, imposing discipline, and using reasonable \nforce. See id.; see also Turner v. Lynaugh, 1994 WL 652587, at *4 (5th Cir. 1994) (per \ncuriam).  \nAt the same time, the Eighth Amendment grants all persons the right to be free from \n“cruel and unusual punishments.” U.S. Const. amend. VIII (“Excessive bail shall not be \nrequired, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted.”). \nAlthough the Eighth Amendment “does not mandate comfortable prisons,” Rhodes v. \nChapman, 452 U.S. 337, 349 (1981), “[p]rison officials must provide humane conditions \nof confinement; they must ensure that inmates receive adequate food, clothing, shelter, and \nmedical care, and must take reasonable measure to ensure the safety of the inmates,” Gates \nv. Cook, 376 F.3d 323, 332 (5th Cir. 2004). “[M]ental health needs are no less serious than \nphysical needs.” Id. “While the prison administration may punish, it may not do so in a \nmanner that threatens the physical and mental health of prisoners.” Young v. Quinlan, 960 \nF.2d 351, 364 (3d Cir. 1992) (cleaned up) (emphasis added).  \nAs stated above, the Eighth Amendment mandates inmates be housed in humane \nconditions, though not necessarily comfortable ones. Rhodes, 452 U.S. at 349; Cook, 376 \n \nlaw (2) that occurred under color of state law, and (3) was caused by a state actor.” Victoria \nW. v. Larpenter, 369 F.3d 475, 482 (5th Cir. 2004). \n35 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 754   Filed 07/18/24   Page 38 of 172 PageID #: \n55198\nF.3d at 332. In determining whether prison officials have violated the Eighth Amendment, \ncourts must apply a two-part test. The first part is an objective test; courts must consider \nwhether the alleged constitutional deprivation is of a “sufficiently serious” nature. See \nWilson v. Seiter, 501 U.S. 294, 298 (1991) (summarizing the objective component as \nasking whether the deprivation was “sufficiently serious”). To be sufficiently serious, the \nalleged deprivation must result in the denial of the “minimal civilized measure of life’s \nnecessities,” Rhodes, 452 U.S. at 347, or result in inmates being housed under conditions \nthat pose a substantial risk of serious harm, Farmer, 511 U.S. at 834. See also Helling v. \nMcKinney, 509 U.S. 25, 35 (1993). The United States Supreme Court has made clear that \nthese standards are not static but should be based on “the evolving standards of decency \nthat mark the progress of a maturing society.” Rhodes, 452 U.S. at 346 (quoting Trop v. \nDulles, 356 U.S. 86, 101 (1958)); see also Farmer, 511 U.S. at 833-34.   \nThe second part of the test is subjective; the fact finder must determine whether the \ndefendants were deliberately indifferent to an inmate’s health and safety. “A prison official \ndisplays deliberate indifference only if he (1) ‘knows that inmates face a substantial risk of \nserious bodily harm’ and (2) ‘disregards that risk by failing to take reasonable measures to \nabate it.’” Arenas v. Calhoun, 922 F.3d 616, 620 (5th Cir. 2019) (quoting Gobert v. \nCaldwell, 463 F.3d 339, 346 (5th Cir. 2006)). An obvious risk could be sufficient to allow \na fact finder to conclude that prison officials knew of the risk. Hinojosa v. Livingston, 807 \nF.3d 657, 667 (5th Cir. 2015) (citing Cook, 376 F.3d at 340); see Farmer, 511 U.S. at 842; \nHarris v. Hegmann, 198 F.3d 153, 159 (5th Cir. 1999). Willful blindness is not a defense. \nSee Farmer, 511 U.S. at 843 n.8 (stating a defendant “would not escape liability if the \n36 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 754   Filed 07/18/24   Page 39 of 172 PageID #: \n55199\nevidence  showed  that  he  merely  refused  to  verify  underlying  facts  that  he  strongly \nsuspected to be true, or declined to confirm inferences of risk that he strongly suspected to \nexist”). “The long duration of a cruel prison condition may make it easier to establish \nknowledge and hence some form of intent . . .” Wilson, 501 U.S. at 300.  \nB. Conditions of Confinement \nIn its prior ruling, the Court determined that Plaintiffs were able to meet their burden \nin proving that the conditions, policies, and practices in place on the South Compound \nconstituted cruel and unusual punishment and that Defendants were deliberately indifferent \nin housing inmates under such conditions without taking any reasonable steps to alleviate \nthose conditions. Moreover, the Court held that Defendants’ actions violated the Eighth \nAmendment. Specifically, the Court found that DWCC confined its inmates in extremely \nsmall cells for twenty-three to twenty-four hours per day with little to no meaningful human \ncontact, mental stimulation, and exercise, sometimes for years at a time. This practice, \ncombined  with  DWCC’s  use  of  strip  cell  status,  subjected  inmates  to  extreme \npsychological pain and suffering.  Additionally, for inmates  diagnosed with a mental \nillness, the conditions of extended lockdown and assignment to strip cell status only \nexacerbated their mental health symptoms. As a result, Defendants showed a wanton \ndisregard for the mental health of the inmates on the South Compound.  \ni.  Substantial Risk of Serious Harm \nThe Court turns first to the objective test to determine whether DWCC’s treatment \nof  inmates  housed  on  extended  lockdown  continues  to  constitute  cruel  and  unusual \npunishment and will continue to constitute cruel and unusual punishment into the future. \n37 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 754   Filed 07/18/24   Page 40 of 172 PageID #: \n55200\n“There is a line where solitary confinement conditions become so severe that its use is \nconverted from a viable prisoner disciplinary tool to cruel and unusual punishment.” Gates \nv. Collier, 501 F.2d 1291, 1304 (5th Cir. 1974). “[A] remedy for unsafe conditions need \nnot await a tragic event.” Helling, 509 U.S. at 33. “Conditions of confinement may \nestablish an Eighth Amendment violation ‘in combination’ when each would not do so \nalone, but only when they have a mutually enforcing effect that produces the deprivation \nof a single, identifiable human need.” Cook, 376 F.3d at 333 (citation omitted). “It goes \nwithout question that an incarceration that inflicts daily, permanently damaging, physical \ninjury and pain is unconstitutional. . . . [T]he same standards that protect against physical \ntorture  prohibit  mental  torture  as  well—including  the  mental  torture  of  excessive \ndeprivation.” Ruiz v. Johnson, 37 F. Supp. 2d 855, 914 (S.D. Tex. 1999), rev’d on other \ngrounds, Ruiz v. United States, 243 F.3d 941 (5th Cir. 2001) (citation omitted). “Mental \nhealth, just as much as physical health, is a mainstay of life. Indeed, it is beyond any serious \ndispute that mental health is a need as essential to a meaningful human existence as other \nbasic physical demands our bodies may make for shelter, warmth or sanitation.” Madrid v. \nGomez,  889  F.  Supp.  1146,  1264  (N.D.  Cal.  1995).  If  “the  particular  conditions  of \nsegregation being challenged are such that they inflict a serious mental illness, greatly \nexacerbate mental illness, or deprive inmates of their sanity, then defendants have deprived \ninmates of a basic necessity of human existence—indeed, they have crossed into the realm \nof psychological torture.” Id. at 1264. \n \n \n38 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 754   Filed 07/18/24   Page 41 of 172 PageID #: \n55201\n1.  Psychological Harms of Solitary Confinement \nIn its liability phase opinion, the Court concluded that the severity of the conditions \nand length of time an inmate spends on extended lockdown put that inmate at a serious risk \nof harm. Record Document 641 at 38-43. During that trial, Dr. Haney—who spent over \nforty years of his career studying the psychological effects of solitary confinement—opined \nthat a lack of meaningful human contact and social isolation for extended periods of time \ncould result in permanent psychological and physical harm. Id. at 39-40. Dr. Burns testified \nregarding a consensus within the field of correctional psychiatry that inmates with mental \nillness are at a greater risk of decompensation because the conditions of restrictive housing \ncan exacerbate their mental illness. Id. at 40-41. Dr. Thompson challenged Plaintiffs’ \nexperts’ opinions by citing to the Colorado Study, a one-year study into Colorado’s prison \nsystem. Id. at 41-42. Ultimately, the Court was not convinced by the Colorado Study’s \napplicability to conditions of confinement at DWCC, finding that inmates in Colorado were \nallowed various privileges that inmates at DWCC were not. Id. at 42.  \nDuring the remedy phase of trial, Defendants, however, maintained their position \nthat long-term incarceration on extended lockdown does not result in psychological harm \nto inmates with or without a mental illness. The Court permitted the parties to present \nadditional evidence of the psychological harms of solitary confinement. The experts’ \ntestimony  on  the  psychological  harms  of  solitary  confinement  mainly  consisted  of \nreiterations of the same literature and studies discussed during the liability phase of trial. \nAs such, the Court sees no reason to depart from its prior finding that solitary confinement \n39 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 754   Filed 07/18/24   Page 42 of 172 PageID #: \n55202\ncan have permanent, long-lasting effects on inmates, especially those suffering from mental \nillness. \nAlthough not offered into evidence by the parties, the Court’s own experience with \nfederal prisons allows it to take judicial notice of the Federal Bureau of Prison’s (“BOP”) \nposition on restrictive housing. This position is reflected in a recent joint statement by \nColette Peters, Director of the BOP, and Nancy La Vigne, Director of the National Institute \nof Justice: \nOur decades-long experience as a correctional leader and policy researcher \nhave made us keenly aware of the harms that restrictive housing may cause \nto a person’s mental, emotional, and physical well-being. NIJ-sponsored \nresearch on restrictive housing has found that it is not an effective deterrent, \nwith  studies  yielding  mixed  results  on  its  impact  on  misconduct  and \nrecidivism and generally finding that it does not reduce institutional-level \nmisconduct or violence. In fact, two studies sponsored by NIJ found evidence \nof an increased likelihood of recidivism after release from incarceration that \ninvolved restrictive  housing  compared to those  who did not experience \nrestrictive housing. \nColette  Peters,  Nancy  La  Vigne,  Restrictive  Housing  Practices  Statement  of  Work, \nFEDERAL BUREAU OF PRISONS (May 5, 2023), \nhttps://www.bop.gov/resources/news/20230505_research_on_restrictive_housing.jsp (last \nvisited June 11, 2024).  \nFor these reasons, the Court’s opinion regarding the harmful effect of both the \nlength of time and the conditions of segregated housing on inmates, especially on those \nwith mental illness, is unchanged.  The Court finds in general  that this harm, which \nDefendants have been unable to remedy, continues and will continue to persist into the \nfuture.  \n40 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 754   Filed 07/18/24   Page 43 of 172 PageID #: \n55203\n2.  Conditions on the South Compound \nIn its liability phase opinion, the Court held that the physical composition of the \ncells on extended lockdown, the social isolation and enforced idleness, the length of time \nthat inmates spend on extended lockdown, and the available disciplinary sanctions all put \ninmates on extended lockdown at a substantial risk of physical and emotional harm. The \nCourt will evaluate whether Defendants were able to remedy the deficiencies in each of \nthese areas in turn.  \na.  Physical Composition and Environment \nPreviously, the Court found that the physical composition of the tiers on the South \nCompound were “designed to reduce activity and positive stimulation,” noting the small \nsize of the cells, the double bunking of cells, the lack of visual stimulation, the fluctuating \nnoise levels, and the lack of adequate climate controls. Record Document 641 at 43-46. \nThe Court will address each below. \ni.  Size of the Cell \nPreviously, the Court determined that the cells in restrictive housing were too small \nand non-compliant with ACA standards. Id. at 43. Specifically, the Court held that: \nThe cells in buildings N-1 through N-4 are stark and extremely small—\napproximately  fifty-six  square  feet,  which  is  non-compliant  with  the \nAmerican Correctional Association standards for cell size and substantially \nsmaller than other isolation units throughout the country. . . . The cells have \neither a single or a double built-in bunk, a toilet-sink unit, a mirror, and a \nmetal footlocker for storing items. \nId. (internal citations omitted). The parties stipulated that the size of the cells on extended \nlockdown have not changed since the liability phase of trial. See Ex. JR-60 at ¶ 8 [Record \n41 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 754   Filed 07/18/24   Page 44 of 172 PageID #: \n55204\nDocument 715-54]. As such, the Court finds that Defendants have failed to remedy this \ndeficient condition. Plaintiffs were able to prove that the deficient condition persists and \nwill continue to persist into the future.   \nii.  Double Bunking \nThe Court also held that the practice of double bunking inmates in one small cell \ncontributed to the physical restrictions of inmates on the tiers. Specifically, the practice of \nhousing two or more inmates in such tight quarters had a negative impact on inmates’ \nmental health. Id. at 44 n.35. As Dr. Haney previously explained, “unavoidably close \ncontact is potentially very dangerous in a different way because of the possibility that \nconflict will arise between people who are housed under those conditions with virtually \nnothing to do and virtually no opportunity to get away from one another.” Haney Liability \nTrial Tr. vol. XIII at 2989:1-5 [Record Document 553]. \nDefendants  contend  that  they  have  drastically  reduced  the  practice  of  double \nbunking in the tiers, an assertion that Plaintiffs did not dispute. During his testimony, \nWarden Goodwin stated that all the cells in the N-3 and N-4 tiers are now single bunked, \nGoodwin Remedy Trial Tr. vol. XI at 2569:14-17 [Record Document 717], a practice \nwhich both parties’ experts concluded to be an improvement, see Haney Remedy Trial Tr. \nvol. X at 2289:1-13 [Record Document 713]; Haney Remedy Trial Tr. vol. XIII at 2863:4-\n2865:14 [Record Document 720]. Warden Goodwin also testified that it was DWCC’s \nintent to completely eliminate the practice of double bunking in the N-2A and N-2B tiers, \nand yet, there were still approximately four double bunked cells in those tiers at the time \n42 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 754   Filed 07/18/24   Page 45 of 172 PageID #: \n55205\nof  his  testimony.  Id.  at  2571:15-19.  While  double  bunking  has  not  been  eliminated \ncompletely, the Court does find that the practice has been reduced on extended lockdown.35  \nWhile it may not be feasible for the prison to reconfigure all the cells on extended \nlockdown to meet the ACA’s standards relating to the physical size of the cell itself, \nDWCC’s decision to reduce the number of double bunked cells in some extended lockdown \ntiers proves that it is not only feasible but easy to eliminate double bunking across all cells. \nThus, Defendants have not carried their burden in proving that the issue of crowding in the \ncells has been eliminated. Plaintiffs were able to prove that the double bunking of cells is \na deficient practice that continues to persist and will continue to persist in the future.  \niii.  Lack of Visual Stimulation \nDuring  the  liability  phase  of  trial,  the  Court  held  that  inmates  lacked  visual \nstimulation, noting that “[a]ll cells on the South Compound are open front cells that face \nconcrete walls and the outer windows; the cell doors are made of perforated metal, which \nsignificantly blocks vision out of the cell.” Record Document 641 at 44. Contributing to \nthis lack of visual stimulation is the enforced idleness, discussed in more detail below. \n \n35 Upchurch opined that the number of inmates in segregated housing has decreased by \ntwenty-eight percent since the liability phase of trial. Upchurch Remedy Trial Tr. vol. XII \nat  2740:5-8  [Record  Document  719].  However,  the  Court  is  not  satisfied  with  the \nmethodology that he used to arrive at that number. In coming to twenty-eight percent, \nUpchurch simply compared the number of inmates in segregated housing in February 2021 \nto the number of inmates in segregated housing in August 2022. Id. at 2741:5-19. However, \nhe did not compare the percentage of inmates in segregated housing to the percentage of \ninmates in general population for these two dates. Id. at 2741:24-25. In other words, \nUpchurch was unable to conclusively answer whether the population of segregated housing \nwas actually reduced because of efforts taken by DWCC to decrease the number of inmates \nin restrictive housing or if there was a general decrease in DWCC’s inmate population that \nthen resulted in an overall reduction in these numbers.  \n43 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 754   Filed 07/18/24   Page 46 of 172 PageID #: \n55206\nBasically, inmates are stuck in these small cells with nothing to do and nothing to look at. \nThe parties stipulated that the physical makeup and layout of the cell has not changed since \nthe liability phase of trial. See Ex. JR-60 at ¶ 8 [Record Document 715-54]. The persistence \nof enforced idleness is discussed below. As a result, Defendants have failed to remedy the \nlack of visual stimulation in the cells.  Plaintiffs have proved that the  lack of visual \nstimulation continues to persist and will continue to persist into the future.  \niv.  Fluctuating Noise Levels \nDuring the liability phase of trial, the Court determined that the noise levels on the \ntiers fluctuate between “complete silence and loud chaos.” Id. This is because inmates \nwould consistently scream and shout, despite DWCC policy mandating that the inmates \nspeak to one another in low conversational tones. See Ex. P-JJJ-24 at 2 [Record Document \n564-203]. The only evidence that the parties advanced on this topic pertained to the \naddition of more fans on the tiers. However, the testimony on this issue was conflicting. \nSecretary Pacholke opined that the fans increased the noise level on the tier. Pacholke \nRemedy Trial Tr. vol. III at 509:2-19 [Record Document 706]. One inmate testified that \nthe fans did not affect the sound level on the tier, Belton Remedy Trial Tr. vol. II at 427:18-\n428:1 [Record Document 705], whereas a different inmate testified that the fans did make \nthe noise level on the tier louder, but not too loud to disturb a phone conversation, Dempster \nRemedy Trial Tr. vol. at 1494:10-16, 1500:10-17 [Record Document 710]. Considering the \nforegoing information, the Court finds that Defendants were unable to establish that they \nremedied the issue of the fluctuating noise levels on the tier. Plaintiffs have proved that the \ncondition continues to persist and will continue to persist into the future. \n44 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 754   Filed 07/18/24   Page 47 of 172 PageID #: \n55207\nv.  Lack of Adequate Climate Controls \nThe South Compound contains no air conditioning or central heating.  Record \nDocument 641 at 45-46. During the liability phase of trial, the Court held that officials at \nDWCC subject inmates on restricted housing to both excruciatingly hot and extremely cold \ntemperatures. Id. During that trial, inmates testified about the extreme measures they took \nto cool off during the summer, including sticking their feet into their toilets, laying on the \nfloor, and removing their jumpsuits. Id. Inmates testified that the oscillating fans provided \nlittle to no relief from the cruel Louisiana heat. Id. They also testified that during the winter \nit was so cold that they could see their own breath. Id. at 46. Yet, without any blankets, \nthey were forced to live in cells that had open and/or broken windows. Id. at 46.  \nDefendants contend that they have remedied the lack of climate controls on the tiers. \nSpecifically, they argue that they have increased the number of oscillating fans on each tier \nfrom four to eight. See Record Document 733 at 18; see also Belton Remedy Trial Tr. vol. \nII at 426:24-427:7 [Record Document 705]; Dempster Remedy Trial Tr. vol. VII at 1500:7-\n9 [Record Document 710]. Plaintiffs argue that Defendants were unable to provide any \nevidence that these additional fans have provided the inmates with any respite from the \nheat. Record Document 732 at ¶ 29.  \nThe Court acknowledges that the number of fans on the tiers increased from four to \neight. However, Defendants were unable to prove that the fans remedied the issue of the \nhigh temperatures on the tiers. Defendants did not provide any data or evidence to establish \nthat those fans have been effective in remedying the issue. Further, Defendants did not \neven address the issue of the cold temperatures during the winter. In sum, the Court finds \n45 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 754   Filed 07/18/24   Page 48 of 172 PageID #: \n55208\nthat Defendants were unable to prove that they have remedied the extreme temperatures on \nthe tiers throughout the year.  \nb.   Social Isolation and Enforced Idleness \nDuring the liability phase of trial, the Court determined that DWCC’s policies and \nprocedures resulted in inmates being deprived of any meaningful human contact and \nopportunities for mental stimulation. Record Document 641 at 46. Defendants contend that \nthey have implemented changes at DWCC that have remedied the social isolation and \nidleness on extended lockdown. Record Document 733 at 17. Plaintiffs maintain that \ninmate isolation and idleness have not been remedied. Record Document 732 at ¶ 25.  \ni.  Social Isolation \nIn its liability phase opinion, the Court held that inmates on extended lockdown \nspent anywhere between twenty-three to twenty-four hours per day locked in their cells. \nRecord Document 641 at 46. Specifically, the Court found that: 1) inmates were only \nafforded approximately one hour outside of their cell to shower and/or use the recreation \ncages; 2) inmates ate every meal in their cells; 3) inmates were denied attendance to any \nout-of-cell programming or classes; 4) inmates were permitted only non-contact visitation \nthrough a telephone; and 5) inmates were permitted only one ten-minute phone call per \nmonth. Id. at 46-47.  \nFirst, as to recreation, the Court previously determined that DWCC did not provide \ninmates with an adequate amount of time for recreation. Id. at 46. During the remedy phase \nof trial, the Court reviewed Offender Posted Policy #35, implemented on April 13, 2022, \nand which details the privileges and restrictions in place for inmates housed in maximum \n46 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 754   Filed 07/18/24   Page 49 of 172 PageID #: \n55209\ncustody. See Ex. JR-25 [Record Document 715-20]. According to the policy, inmates in \nthe  N-2A,  N-2B,  N-3,  and  N-4  tiers—investigative,  preventative,  and  disciplinary \nsegregation—are allowed one hour of recreation per day, five days a week. Id. at 3. Dr. \nHaney observed that no modifications to the recreation area were made since his first visit; \nin other words, DWCC still utilized exercise cages that lacked weather protection, exercise \nequipment, or any areas for seating. Haney Remedy Trial Tr. vol. X at 2217:11-2218:17 \n[Record Document 713]. The only improvement is that Defendants no longer take away an \ninmate’s recreation time as a behavioral sanction.36 Pacholke Remedy Trial Tr. vol. III at \n578:21-24 [Record Document 706].  \nInmates housed in N-1, N-2C (working segregation), and N-2D (CCR) are permitted \ntwo hours of recreational time in the yard. See Ex. JR-25 at 3 [Record Document 715-20]. \nWhile this is certainly an improvement for inmates housed in those tiers, Defendants have \nfailed to prove that they have remedied the issue of the insufficient amount and quality of \nrecreational privileges for inmates in N-2A, N-2B, N-3, and N-4. \n  Second,  inmates  in  investigative,  disciplinary,  and  preventative  segregation \ncontinue to eat their meals alone in their cells. Ex. JR-60 at ¶ 9 [Record Document 715-\n54]. This has not been remedied. However, inmates in N-1 and working segregation are \npermitted to eat their meals in the dining hall, which is an improvement. Id. at ¶¶ 15-16. \nThe parties did not offer any evidence regarding where inmates on CCR eat their meals.  \n \n36 However, per Department Regulation IS-B-4, the termination of an inmate’s access to \nrecreational privileges is an approved sanction for behavioral issues. See Ex. JR-1 at 12 \n[Record Document 715-1].  \n47 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 754   Filed 07/18/24   Page 50 of 172 PageID #: \n55210\nThird, inmates in investigative, disciplinary, and preventative segregation are still \nnot permitted to attend religious services, id. at ¶ 9, or attend any out-of-cell classes or \ngroup programming, Burgos Remedy Trial Tr. vol. IV at 832:11-22 [Record Document \n707]. Inmates housed in these tiers are still only permitted to partake in correspondence \ncourses37 or receive tutoring38 through the cell door. Sherman Remedy Trial Tr. vol. II at \n375:9-13 [Record Document 705]. This has not changed since the liability phase of trial.  \nHowever,  there  have  been  some  changes  regarding  the  provision  of  group \nprogramming and classes on N-1, N-2C (working segregation) and N-2D (CCR). In June \n2022, inmates housed in working segregation became eligible to attend out-of-cell classes. \nBurgos Remedy Trial Tr. vol. IV at 830:12-14, 831:7-11 [Record Document 707]. Inmates \nin working segregation attend classes in the North Compound’s chapel from 8:30 a.m. to \n10:00 a.m. on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. Id. at 830:15-20. Inmates in working \nsegregation may participate in programming on topics like anger management, victim \n \n37 Secretary Pacholke testified regarding the benefits of in-person classes and programming \non this segment of DWCC’s inmate population. First, Secretary Pacholke opined that in-\nperson programming provides a more effective means for an inmate to learn the material, \nreduces social isolation, and gives prison officials an opportunity to determine which \ninmates continue to pose a threat to the prison and inmate population. Pacholke Remedy \nTrial Tr. vol. III at 522:5-22 [Record Document 706].  \n38  Assistant  Warden  Sherman  testified  that  inmate  tutors—who  are  certified  by  the \neducation department—have been available for private tutoring since the liability phase of \ntrial. Sherman Remedy Trial Tr. vol. II at 376:8-19 [Record Document 705]. However, the \nparties did not present any evidence to support this assertion. These tutors help inmates as \nthey study for their High School Equivalency Test, which an inmate can take after he is \nreclassified into general population. Id. at 376:20-377:2. The tutors do not go inside the \ncell with the inmate but rather conduct any tutoring from the cell front. Id. at 377:3-11. \nInmate tutors are available upon request, though Assistant Warden Sherman indicated that \nit is not a frequently utilized resource. Id. at 377:12-23.  \n48 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 754   Filed 07/18/24   Page 51 of 172 PageID #: \n55211\nawareness, and problem solving. Id. 830:21-24. In August 2020, group programming \nbecame available to inmates housed in CCR, id. at 822:1-3, although the only curriculum \navailable is victim awareness.39 Id. at 825:7-9. Inmates on the N-1 tier can access group \nprogramming in the afternoon. Ex. JR-60 at ¶ 16 [Record Document 715-54]. \nFourth,  the  Court  previously  found  that  inmates  on  extended  lockdown  were \nallowed noncontact visitation by a telephone and through a glass window with other \ninmates sitting next to them in that room for their own visitations. Record Document 641 \nat 47. The parties stipulate that the availability and procedures for visitation have not \nmaterially changed since the liability phase of trial. Inmates in the N-2A, N-2B, N-3, and \nN-4 tiers are only permitted noncontact visits on the weekend. Ex. JR-60 at ¶ 19 [Record \nDocument 715-54]. An inmate housed in CCR is permitted one contact visit per month if \nhe has been housed there for at least three months, while an inmate in working segregation \nis allowed two contact visits per month. Id.  \nFifth, the Court previously found that inmates housed on extended lockdown were \npermitted only a single phone call every month for ten minutes, available to them at \nirregular intervals. Record Document 641 at 47. Since March 2020, DWCC has increased \nthe number of phone calls permitted to inmates housed on extended lockdown. According \nto Offender Posted Policy #35, inmates in investigative, disciplinary, preventative, and \nworking segregation are now able to use the phones two times per month for fifteen minutes \n \n39 Victim awareness teaches inmates about the “potential consequences their actions have \non . . . victims, whether it be other family members or actual victims of their crimes . . . .” \nBurgos Remedy Trial Tr. vol. IV at 825:15-19 [Record Document 707]. \n49 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 754   Filed 07/18/24   Page 52 of 172 PageID #: \n55212\neach. Ex. JR-25 at 2 [Record Document 715-20]. Inmates in CCR are permitted three thirty-\nminute phone calls per week, id., and inmates in N-1 are permitted sixteen calls per month, \nEx. JR-60 at 5 [Record Document 715-54]. Additionally, inmates are now afforded a phone \ncall upon initial placement into extended lockdown so that they can inform their families \nthat their communication will be reduced. Pacholke Remedy Trial Tr. vol. II at 458:22-24 \n[Record Document 705].  \nDr. Haney testified that inmates on extended lockdown should be provided with \nmore phone privileges because “they have no other or very little other normal meaningful \nsocial contact with people.” Haney Remedy Trial Tr. vol. X at 2225:20-2226:15 [Record \nDocument 713]. As a result, Dr. Haney suggested that inmates on extended lockdown be \ngranted the same amount of phone privileges as those in N-1—four times per week. Id. at \n2228:11-18.  \nAdditionally, conversations between an inmate and his loved one are not private. \nTo use the phone, a DWCC official will roll a phone cart down the tier and will leave the \ncart outside of the inmate’s cell. Pacholke Remedy Trial Tr. vol. II at 471:19-472:7 [Record \nDocument 705]. Secretary Pacholke argued that it is imperative that inmates be permitted \nto have private conversations because it allows them: \n. . . to talk about . . . [their] struggles, I guess, with [their] family or [their] \nloved ones, talk about, you know, what is going on with [them], whether it is \nconcerning [their] release, whether it could be medication. It could be, you \nknow, visits with mental health staff. It could be perceptions around, you \nknow, what they might perceive as abusive conditions or abusive treatment. \nYou know, they simply might want to have a conversation confidentially \nwith a family member or a loved one that is not subject to being heard by, \nyou know, everyone on that tier. And it may restrict their conversation to a \ncertain degree. \n50 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 754   Filed 07/18/24   Page 53 of 172 PageID #: \n55213\nId. at 472:10-20. Secretary Pacholke ultimately opined that the rolling carts—while not \nideal—were an improvement over inmates having to be escorted to the front of the tier for \nphone  conversations.  Pacholke  Remedy  Trial  Tr.  vol.  II  at  471:19-472:7  [Record \nDocument 705]; Haney Remedy Trial Tr. vol. X at 2227:4-2228:7 [Record Document 713].  \nii.  Enforced Idleness \nDuring  the  liability  phase  of  trial,  the  Court  found  that  inmates  on  extended \nlockdown were permitted only “minimal” personal belongings. Record Document 641 at \n48. Specifically, the Court found that inmates were permitted “one religious book, three \nother books or magazines, [] some legal work for mental stimulation. . . . [And] very limited \naccess to the canteen—otherwise known as the commissary—for personal care items, \npaper, flex pens, envelopes, and stamps.” Id. Additionally, the Court found that inmates on \nextended lockdown were not permitted to use televisions, radios, or crafts. Id.  \nAs the parties stipulated, the policies surrounding possessions have not changed \nsince the liability phase of trial for inmates housed in investigative, disciplinary, and \npreventative segregation. Ex. JR-60 at ¶ 18 [Record Document 715-54]. These inmates are \nstill only permitted to spend ten dollars at the canteen once a week; possess a single book \nor magazine at once; and have no access to televisions, radios, or crafts. Id  \nInmates on N-1 are permitted the same possessions as those inmates in medium \ncustody, including a tablet and access to a television on the tier. Id. at ¶ 16. Inmates in CCR \nand working segregation are permitted a radio, CD player, or a CD player that can access \nthe radio. Ex. JR-26 at 6 [Record Document 715-21]. They are also allowed to possess up \nto six books or magazines, id., and have access to televisions on the tiers, Ex. JR-25 at 3 \n51 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 754   Filed 07/18/24   Page 54 of 172 PageID #: \n55214\n[Record Document 715-20]. Inmates in CCR may also access crafts but are limited to those \ncrafts that are “non-toxic/non-flammable.” Id.  \nOverall, the Court finds that the conditions of confinement on extended lockdown \ncontinue to expose inmates to a substantial risk of harm. Inmates are confined to incredibly \nsmall spaces with no visual or mental stimulation and with inadequate opportunities for \nphysical activity. And, as discussed in the next section, these conditions persist not just for \na day or two, but for indefinite time periods which may be months or, for some inmates, \nyears. While some effort was made as detailed above, Defendants were unable to remedy \nthe social isolation and enforced idleness imposed upon inmates housed on extended \nlockdown. Plaintiffs have proven that the conditions of confinement on extended lockdown \ncontinue to persist and will continue to persist into the future.  \nc.  Length of Time on Extended Lockdown \nIn Hutto v. Finney, the Supreme Court held that “the length of confinement cannot \nbe ignored in deciding whether the confinement meets constitutional standards. A filthy, \novercrowded cell and a diet of ‘grue’ might be tolerable for a few days and intolerably \ncruel for a few weeks or months.” 437 U.S. 678, 686-687 (1978), abrogated on other \ngrounds by Dep’t of Agric. Rural Dev. Rural Hous. Serv. v. Kirtz, 601 U.S. 42, 53 (2024). \nOther factors that a court may consider include diet, overcrowding, violence, or a “lack of \nprofessionalism and good judgment on the part of maximum security personnel.” Id. at 687 \n(citation omitted). Additionally, in the due process context, the Fifth Circuit has found that \na “prisoner has no liberty interest in his custodial classification” and that “prison officials \nshould be accorded the widest possible deference in classifying prisoners’ custodial status \n52 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 754   Filed 07/18/24   Page 55 of 172 PageID #: \n55215\nas necessary to maintain security and preserve internal order.” See Wilkerson v. Goodwin, \n774 F.3d 845, 852 (5th Cir. 2014) (quoting Hernandez v. Velasquez, 522 F.3d 556, 562 \n(5th Cir. 2008)). However, in cases of “atypical and significant hardship,” the Fifth Circuit \nconsiders the “duration of the solitary confinement, the severity of the restrictions, and \ntheir effectively indefinite nature” in assessing whether a prison is violating the due process \nrights of an inmate for confining them on extended lockdown for an indefinite period of \ntime. Id. at 853-55.  \nThe Court interprets the jurisprudence as allowing a district court to consider the \nlength  of  time  that  an  inmate  spends  on  extended  lockdown,  along  with  any  other \nconditions of confinement that may result in the violation of the inmate’s constitutional \nrights. In other words, in cases where a plaintiff alleges that his Eighth Amendment rights \nare being violated, a court may consider the indefinite nature of an inmate’s stay on \nextended lockdown as a condition of his overall confinement.  \nDuring the liability phase of trial, the Court found that DWCC subjects its inmates \nto extended lockdown for an indefinite length of time. Record Document 641 at 49. This \nfact has not changed. In its liability phase opinion, the Court noted that a September 2019 \nreport showed that over 200 inmates had been housed on extended lockdown for over thirty \ndays. Id. at 50. The Court also cited to several examples of inmates who had been housed \non extended lockdown for years, including Damion Williams, Jackie Sampson, and Theron \nNelson, each of whom had been housed on extended lockdown for almost five years; \nMatthew Carrol, who had been housed there for over three years; and Tyler Blanchard and \nCarlton Turner who had spent just under three years on extended lockdown. Id. Defendants \n53 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 754   Filed 07/18/24   Page 56 of 172 PageID #: \n55216\nclaim that inmates are housed on extended lockdown only for as long as they “pose a direct \nthreat to the safety of people or a clear threat to the safe and secure operations of the \nfacility.” Record Document 733 at 13. Plaintiffs contend that “Defendants continue to \nhouse prisoners in solitary confinement conditions for months and . . . years.” Record \nDocument 733 at 6.  \nDuring the remedy phase of trial, Plaintiffs presented evidence in support of their \nposition, including testimony regarding the continuous confinement reports that track how \nlong each inmate has been housed on extended lockdown. During his testimony, Kimball \nwalked the Court through three of the continuous confinement reports that were drafted for \nWarden  Goodwin.40  See  Kimball  Remedy  Trial  Tr.  vol.  I  at  232:10-239:17  [Record \nDocument 704]. The first report showed that 174 inmates had been housed on extended \nlockdown for over 30 days, 1 of whom had been on extended lockdown for approximately \n3.5 years, 2 for nearly 3 years, 1 for approximately 2.5, 3 for 2 years, 3 for nearly a year \nand a half, and 1 for approximately a year. See Record Document PR-L-1 at 5 [Record \nDocument 716-97]. A second report, dated November 4, 2020, demonstrated that 176 \ninmates had been housed on extended lockdown for over 30 days, 1 inmate had been on \nextended lockdown for almost 4 years, 1 inmate for over 3.5 years, 3 inmates for over 2.5 \nyears, 2 inmates for over 1.5 years, and 28 inmates for about a year. See Record Document \nPR-L-9 at 5 [Record Document 716-105]. A third report, dated June 6, 2022, showed that \n \n40 Kimball’s predecessor, Rodney Long, drafted the first report. Kimball Remedy Trial Tr. \nvol. I at 233:2-10 [Record Document 704]. Kimball drafted the other two reports. Id. at \n233:16-235:12.  \n54 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 754   Filed 07/18/24   Page 57 of 172 PageID #: \n55217\n142 inmates were housed on extended lockdown for longer than 30 days, 1 of whom had \nbeen housed on extended lockdown for 5.5 years, 4 for approximately 2.5 years, 5 for \nnearly 2 years, 7 for approximately a year and a half, and 19 for at least a year. See Record \nDocument PR-L-28 at 5 [Record Document 716-124].41 \nThe numbers reflect that DWCC did reduce the population of inmates on extended \nlockdown  for  longer  than  thirty  days  by  twenty-nine  percent.  This  is  certainly  an \nimprovement. However, because no evidence was presented regarding the total inmate \npopulation at DWCC, the Court cannot independently determine whether this decrease was \nthe result of efforts made by officials to reduce the length of an inmate’s assignment to \nextended housing or whether the overall population at DWCC had decreased as a result of \nthe  COVID-19  pandemic.  In  other  words,  the  Court  cannot  ascertain  the  scale, \nproportionality, or basis for the decrease in the extended lockdown population. The Court \nalso observes that from March 2020 to June 2022, the percentage of inmates housed on \nextended  lockdown  for  a  period  of  approximately  one  year  or  more  increased  from \napproximately six percent to approximately twenty-five percent.  \nFurthermore, DWCC has not remedied the policy statements and practices which \nallow for an inmate to be housed on extended lockdown for a potentially indefinite amount \nof time. As the Court learned during the remedy phase, when an inmate commits an \ninfraction, he is housed in disciplinary segregation for up to seventy-two hours, at which \n \n41 These numbers do not include those inmates who were housed on extended lockdown \nfor refusing a tuberculosis test.

Kimball Remedy Trial Tr. vol. I at 209:11-\n22 [Record Document 704]; Ex. JR-11 at 9 [Record Document 715-11]. If an inmate is \nfound  guilty  of  having  committed  that  infraction,  he  is  sentenced  to  disciplinary \nsegregation  for  a  period  of  time  determined  by  the  disciplinary  matrix,  a  new \nimplementation since the liability phase of trial. Kimball Remedy Trial Tr. vol. I at 209:22-\n210:2 [Record Document 704]. For example, the disciplinary matrix specifies that an \ninmate who committed a first-time property destruction offense can be sentenced to a \nperiod of zero to ten days in disciplinary segregation. See Ex. JR-2 at 18 [Record Document \n715-2].  The  disciplinary  matrix—which  the  Court  will  further  discuss  below—is  an \nimprovement on these generalized criteria, but the decision for placement still remains the \nsubjective decision of the security guard. \nAt the end of his sentence in disciplinary segregation, the inmate appears before the \nmulti-disciplinary  review  board.  The  board  can  either  return  the  inmate  to  extended \nlockdown in preventative segregation or transfer him to the working segregation tier. \nKimball Remedy Trial Tr. vol. I at 210:3-20 [Record Document 704]. However, this \ndecision is governed by the most general of criteria. The policy provides that an inmate \nwill be placed in preventative segregation if his “continued presence in general population \nis a danger to the good order and discipline of the facility and/or whose presence poses a \ndanger to himself, other offenders, staff, or the general public.” Ex. JR-10 at 10-11 [Record \nDocument 715-10].  \nIn March 2020, a mental health clinician was added to the multi-disciplinary review \nboard, which is certainly an improvement. Coleman Remedy Trial Tr. vol. I at 44:17-45:4 \n56 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 754   Filed 07/18/24   Page 59 of 172 PageID #: \n55219\n[Record Document 704]. Kimball testified that the multi-disciplinary review board has \naccess to an offender’s classification records—minus those from Dr. Seal—from the past \nyear.  See  Kimball  Remedy  Trial  Tr.  vol.  II  at  286:288:13  [Record  Document  705]. \nHowever,  the  multi-disciplinary  review  board  does  not  consult  these  documents  for \nguidance or insight on an inmate’s mental health. In fact, Kimball testified that an inmate’s \nmental health diagnosis “wouldn’t change our decision for placement in a less restrictive \nhousing.” Id. at 288:19-21.   \nAfter an inmate goes before the multi-disciplinary review board, he is provided with \na copy of the final classification decision. Kimball Remedy Trial Tr. vol. I at 231:5-8 \n[Record Document 704]. The form provided to the inmate lists the type of review, the date, \nthe housing assignment, and has check boxes where a clinician can indicate whether the \ninmate is eligible for review. See ex. Ex. PR-G-2 [Record Document 716-83]. There are \nsix entirely subjective and broad reasons why an inmate may be deemed ineligible for \nreassignment, which include: “1. Poor Attitude[;] 2. Serious nature of past offenses[;] 3. \nDisciplinary reports received during current confinement[;] 4. Pending street charges[;] 5. \nLength/number of times on Extended Lockdown[;] [and] 6. Other” Id. The Court deems \nthese reasons to be inappropriate and/or subjective. There are no written policies or \nguidelines informing the multi-disciplinary review board what criteria they are to consider \nin making these decisions. These deficiencies result in a misuse and overuse of preventative \nsegregation. \nThe form filled out by the multi-disciplinary review board to reflect its decision is \ndeficient. It provides check boxes by a listing of the subjective and broad criteria listed \n57 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 754   Filed 07/18/24   Page 60 of 172 PageID #: \n55220\nabove and also provides a few lines for comments. But, the comment sections are rarely \nfilled out by a member of the board. In fact, the multi-disciplinary review board provides \nan inmate with no insight, guidance, or information regarding the behaviors or actions he \ncould take if he wanted to qualify for reassignment, nor do they explain what specific \nactions or offenses led him to be ineligible for reassignment. This failure thwarts and \ndiscourages any improvement in the inmate’s behavior. Kimball testified that the inmates \nare told of the multi-disciplinary board’s decision “right then and there,” but there was no \nevidence to confirm that this practice occurs. Kimball Remedy Trial Tr. vol. II at 293:16-\n294:21 [Record Document 705].  \nThe lack of specific policies and practices outlining the decision-making processes \nand criteria by which inmates are assigned to segregated housing; the failure to provide \ninmates  with any  specific  explanation regarding  their  assignment or reassignment  to \npreventative segregation; and the failure to provide inmates with any formal or written \nguidance explaining the steps required for them to matriculate out of extended lockdown  \ncollectively result in the housing of inmates on extended lockdown for an indefinite period \nof time. There is no policy which caps the amount of time an inmate may spend on extended \nlockdown, nor is there any meaningful review or audit of the multi-disciplinary board’s \ndecisions at the administrative level.  \nDefendants did not prove that they have remedied their practice of housing inmates \non extended lockdown for an indefinite period of time. Moreover, Plaintiffs met their \nburden in proving that the practice of housing inmates indefinitely on extended lockdown \ncontinues and will continue into the future.   \n58 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 754   Filed 07/18/24   Page 61 of 172 PageID #: \n55221\nd.  Discipline  \nDuring  the  liability  phase  of  trial,  Plaintiffs  presented  evidence  regarding  a \ndisciplinary practice employed at DWCC  known as  “strip cell status.” This practice \ncontinues at DWCC, with only the slightest of review requirements added since the liability \nphase. Tellingly, DWCC is the only Louisiana DOC prison that employs such a practice. \nSmith Remedy Trial Tr. vol. VII at 1447:19-23 [Record Document 710]. Strip cell status \nis an institutional practice wherein an inmate is subjected to solitary confinement with \nnothing but a paper gown and no possessions in his cell. Record Document 641 at 52. This \nmay include the removal of an inmate’s mattress and bedding. Id. During the liability phase \nof trial, inmates testified about the profound impact that strip cell status had on their \nphysical and mental health, including increased feelings of depression and bruising from \nsleeping on a concrete floor. Id. at 56. The experts agreed that the use of strip cell status \nviolated modern correctional practices and minimum standards. Id. The Court found that \nDWCC’s use of strip cell status—the informality of the institution of strip cell status, the \nlength of time an inmate can remain on strip cell status, the lack of possessions, the lack of \nproper attire, the removal of bedding, the use of the restraint chair, and the lack of mental \nhealth reviews by mental health staff—constituted cruel and unusual punishment. Id. at 57. \nDuring the remedy phase of trial, the Court learned that DWCC still maintains strip cell \nstatus. Coleman Remedy Trial Tr. vol. I at 71:25-72:1 [Record Document 704]. The Court \nwill address each deficient aspect of strip cell status below in turn.  \nFirst, the Court previously found that inmates could be placed on strip cell status \nwithout going through the typical disciplinary processes. Id. at 52. During the remedy \n59 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 754   Filed 07/18/24   Page 62 of 172 PageID #: \n55222\nphase of trial, the Court learned that this practice has changed. Since July 24, 2022, the \ndisciplinary court must consult the disciplinary matrix to sanction or punish an inmate for \nhis behavior. Smith Remedy Trial Tr. vol. VII at 1466:25-1467:8 [Record Document 710]. \nDepartment Regulation OP-C-1, known as the “disciplinary matrix,” is “the department’s \ndisciplinary rules and procedures for adult offenders” and was implemented to promote \nconsistency in disciplinary sanctions across the DOC’s prisons. Id. at 1466:9-1468:25. So, \nfor example, if an inmate is written up for the first time for possessing a cell phone, he may \nbe sentenced for up to sixty days in disciplinary segregation. Id. at 1469:5-13; see also Ex. \nJR-2 at 5 [Record 715-2].  \nHowever, strip cell status is not a sanctioned discipline under the disciplinary \nmatrix, despite some of the qualifying behaviors for strip cell status being listed as an \noffense on the matrix for other punishments. The behaviors that can result in the imposition \nof strip cell status—which have not changed since the liability phase—include: throwing \nhuman waste and bodily fluids (including spit); storing weapons, human feces, and urine \nin a container; throwing “any item” outside of the cell; throwing items that may cause a \nsafety  hazard,  including  soap  and  water;  creating  barricades;  threatening  violence  to \nsomeone while in possession of an item that can be used as a weapon; intentionally flooding \nthe cell; violence; and contributing to a “major disturbance.”42 Ex. JR-24 at 3 [Record \n \n42 As the policy explains, strip cell status is meant to be a “last resort” and only employed \nto “prevent violence, protect lives and property.” See Ex. JR-24 at 3 [Record Document \n715-19]. If this were true, then strip cell status should only be employed with defined time \nlimits against inmates who have committed an egregious rule violation. Some of the \npotential behaviors that can result in the imposition of strip cell status are not consistent \n60 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 754   Filed 07/18/24   Page 63 of 172 PageID #: \n55223\nDocument 715-19]. As mentioned above, several of the rule infractions on the disciplinary \nmatrix for which there are specified non-strip cell punishments are also actions that could \nland an inmate in strip cell, such as: aggravated fighting, battery of a correctional officer, \nand aggravated sex offenses to name a few. Ex. JR-2 at 5 [Record Document 715-2]. The \ndecision to not include strip cells status as a possible sanction in the disciplinary matrix \nmeans that there is no way to ensure that strip cell status is being consistently and uniformly \napplied  against  inmates.  Likewise,  the  overlap  of  offenses  that  are  included  on  the \ndisciplinary matrix with offenses that can result in strip cell status illustrates the lack of \nconsistency and uniformity of DWCC’s policies and their enforcement. And, as Secretary \nPacholke highlighted during his testimony, there are no checks and balances governing the \nprocess. Pacholke Remedy Trial Tr. vol. III at 550:24-25 [Record Document 706].    \nDuring the liability phase of trial, the Court found that prison officials could keep \nan inmate with a “documented pattern of behavior” on strip cell status for an undetermined \nlength of time. Record Document 641 at 52. The Court learned that most inmates’ strip cell \nstatus was reviewed every four hours by a shift supervisor. See Ex. P-JJJ-13 at 5 [Record \nDocument 565-47]. However, an inmate who was determined to have a “documented \npattern of behavior” could remain under strip cell status for an undetermined amount of \ntime to be reviewed by the unit manager and a classification officer every thirty days. Id. \nThe Court found that mental health staff did not play a role in the process of placing an \ninmate on strip cell status or in these reviews. Record Document 641 at 52.  \n \nwith the policy’s purpose. For example, the Court wonders how throwing water or a bar of \nsoap warrants the imposition of strip cell status.  \n61 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 754   Filed 07/18/24   Page 64 of 172 PageID #: \n55224\nDuring the remedy phase of trial, the Court learned that inmates continue to have \ntheir strip cell status reviewed every four hours by a shift supervisor, who then documents \nhis findings in a UOR. See Ex. JR-24 at 5 [Record Document 715-19]. To keep an inmate \non strip cell status for more than twenty-four hours requires the approval of a unit manager \nand a UOR that outlines the “clear reasons and justification for continuing this status.” Id. \nHowever,  inmates  with  a  “documented  pattern  of  behavior”—a  term  which  remains \nundefined by the policy—are still subject to strip cell status for an indeterminate amount \nof  time.  According  to  the  latest  version  of  Offender  Posted  Policy  #34,  which  was \nimplemented on August 5, 2021, an inmate’s strip cell status is now reviewed every seven \ndays. Id. at 5. Despite a more frequent review period, the policy explicitly warns that \n“[c]ontinued  violent  behavior  as  outlined  in  this  policy[]  may  result  in  the  offender \nremaining in this status.” Id. The unit manager and the classification officer are tasked with \nreviewing the imposition of strip cell status. This has not changed. Id. Mental health \nclinicians still do not play a role in the process of putting an inmate on strip cell status nor \nin the reviews. Thus, there are no mechanisms by which officials can gauge an inmate’s \nmental status. As Secretary Pacholke opined, inmates typically do not throw feces or urine \nin  general  population  and  “oftentimes  it  is  a  sign  of  some  broader  form  of  mental \ndecompensation.” Pacholke Remedy Trial Tr. vol. III at 551:23-552:3 [Record Document \n706]. Upchurch opined that strip cell status is only used for “as long as necessary to diffuse \nor make the situation to where it is not a danger to the staff, inmate, or so forth.” Upchurch \nRemedy Trial Tr. vol. XII at 2775:9-12 [Record Document 719]. Despite this, Upchurch \n62 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 754   Filed 07/18/24   Page 65 of 172 PageID #: \n55225\nstill agreed that, as written, the policy permits the use of strip cell status for extended \nperiods of time. Id. at 2775:16-18.  \nDuring the liability phase of trial, the Court learned that inmates on strip cell status \nare deprived of their limited possessions—including their clothing—and their recreation \ntime. Record Document 641 at 52. Inmates are placed on strip cell status in nothing but a \npaper gown. Id. Inmates on strip cell status with a “documented pattern of behavior” lost \ntheir mattresses from 5 a.m. to 9 p.m. and were frequently required to sleep on the concrete \nbunk or metal rack because the mattresses were not returned timely. Id. One improvement \nsince the liability phase of trial is that Policy #34 now places more checks on the removal \nof an inmate’s mattress. Specifically, the policy states that mattresses will only be removed \nif they are being used as a barricade or shield. See Ex. JR-24 at 4 [Record Document 715-\n19]. A shift supervisor will review the inmate’s conduct every four hours to determine \nwhether the mattress can be returned to the inmate. Id. This must be documented in an \nUOR. However, if a mattress must remain out of the cell for more than eight hours, the \nshift supervisor must receive “concurrence from the Unit Manager.” Id. The policy does \nnot provide a maximum time for which an inmate can be without a mattress.  \nSecretary Pacholke—who reviewed the changes DWCC has made to its strip cell \nstatus policy—opined that the practice still constitutes torture.43 Pacholke Remedy Trial \n \n43 Secretary Pacholke expressed that it was difficult for him to discuss strip cell status \nbecause of how dehumanizing the practice is. Pacholke Remedy Trial Tr. vol. III at 550:19-\n21 [Record Document 706]. \n63 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 754   Filed 07/18/24   Page 66 of 172 PageID #: \n55226\nTr. vol. III at 548:2-5 [Record Document 706]. Specifically, Secretary Pacholke testified \nthat \nI think it is cruel and it is torture, and I can’t imagine any one of us sitting \nhere today that would be in a concrete bunker with a steel bunk with nothing \non but a paper gown, and be asked to stand there with nothing. And somehow \nthis  is  supposed  to  communicate  that  I  am  going  to  get  better  in  this \nenvironment, this is going to fix my underlying issue if you leave me in a cell \nnaked with a paper gown on a concrete floor. It is a throw-back to probably \nbefore I started my career in 1982. I have never seen anything like it except \nfor now I have seen it in two systems. But this is cruel. This is dehumanizing. \nThis is treating people in a way in which they are subhuman. It is -- it is a \nterrible practice, and it does not -- this kind of practice goes directly against \nwhat makes institutions safe. This kind of illegitimate practice potentially \ncompromises the safety of your staff as well as the offender population. \nId. at 548:5-21.  \nThe Court is convinced by Secretary Pacholke’s assessment of strip cell status. It \nwould also note that Warden Goodwin testified that in 2021, there were discussions \nregarding the elimination of strip cell status altogether. Goodwin Remedy Trial Tr. vol. IX \nat 1922:19-23 [Record Document 712]. Chief Smith also testified that DWCC was the only \nDOC prison that employs such a practice. Smith Remedy Trial Tr. vol. VII at 1447:19-23. \n[Record Document 710]. Taking this evidence and  testimony into consideration, and \ndespite the small improvements made, Defendants have failed to prove that they have \nremedied the prior deficiencies regarding strip cell status. Additionally, Plaintiffs met their \nburden in proving that the deficiencies continue to persist and will continue to persist into \nthe future.  \n \n \n64 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 754   Filed 07/18/24   Page 67 of 172 PageID #: \n55227\n3.  Manifestation of Harm at DWCC \nDuring the liability phase of trial, Plaintiffs presented evidence that the harms \nsuffered by inmates are more than theoretical. Defendants could not rebut this evidence. \nRecord Document 641 at 57-58. The Court specifically cited to Dr. Haney’s observations \nduring his first visit to DWCC of signs of mental anguish and potential decompensation. \nId.  \nThe Court heard similar testimony by the experts during the remedy trial. During \nhis second visit, Dr. Haney observed several inmates housed on extended lockdown who \nwere  “utterly  incoherent  and  in  a  severe  state  of  mental  deterioration”  and  required \nintervention. Haney Remedy Trial Tr. vol. X at 2242:10-16 [Record Document 713]. Dr. \nBurns also observed inmates who were experiencing hallucinations, manic symptoms, self-\ninjurious  behavior,  and  suicidal  tendencies,  all  of  whom  required  mental  health \nintervention. Burns Remedy Trial Tr. vol. VII at 1551:7-1558:4 [Record Document 710].  \nDefendants did not present any testimony or evidence to prove that they have \nremedied some of the ways in which harm manifests itself in inmates placed on extended \nlockdown. In fact, DWCC’s own policies on required mental health evaluations and suicide \nprevention for inmates in restrictive housing explicitly acknowledged that inmates are at a \nsubstantial risk of harm when they are placed in restrictive housing. Despite Defendants’ \ncontinuing position that extended lockdown does not lead to harm, these policies belie that \nposition. For example, DWCC policy mandates segregated housing evaluations for inmates \nwith a mental illness who have been assigned to segregated housing for a period greater \nthan thirty days. See Ex. J-7 at 8-9 [Record Document 565-13]. The suicide prevention \n65 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 754   Filed 07/18/24   Page 68 of 172 PageID #: \n55228\npolicy twice warns DWCC staff of the harms caused by social isolation. First, DWCC \nrequires that “[i]f an offender is placed in a single man cell, frequent conversation with the \noffender shall be attempted by security to reduce possible suicide attempts due to the lack \nof a cellmate . . . .” Ex. JR-14 at 5 [Record Document 715-14] (emphasis added). Further \nin the policy, DWCC staff are instructed that “offenders who are suicidal should be placed \nin the least restrictive setting possible and should not be isolated unless their behavior \nindicates otherwise.” Id. at 6 (emphasis added).  \nIn summary, the evidence presented at trial—including DWCC’s own policies and \nthe expert testimony—demonstrated that the unconstitutional conditions of confinement \nthat are imposed upon inmates on extended lockdown continue to subject inmates to \nphysical and mental torture and will continue to subject inmates to physical and mental \ntorture into the future to which, as the Court will further enunciate, DWCC and Defendants \nhave shown themselves to be deliberately indifferent.  \nii.  Deliberate Indifference  \nAs stated previously, in addition to proving that Defendants’ actions put inmates at \nsubstantial risk of serious harm, Plaintiffs must also demonstrate that correction officials \nhad a subjectively culpable state of mind—that is, they were deliberately indifferent. \nPlaintiffs can carry that burden by showing that Defendants had subjective knowledge of \nthe risk of harm and then failed to take reasonable steps to abate such harm. Additionally, \nthe mere fact that a risk was obvious is sufficient to infer deliberate indifference. Cook, \n376 F.3d at 340. Deliberate indifference can be established if evidence is presented that \nproves that the substantial risk of a particular action was “longstanding, pervasive, well-\n66 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 754   Filed 07/18/24   Page 69 of 172 PageID #: \n55229\ndocumented, or expressly noted by prison officials in the past, and the circumstances \nsuggest that the defendant-official being sued had been exposed to information concerning \nthe risk and thus must have known about it . . .” Farmer, 511 U.S. at 842-43 (internal \nquotation marks and citations omitted). \nDuring the liability phase of trial, the Court found that correctional officials—from \nthe institutional level up to the departmental level—were aware of the conditions on the \nSouth Compound and the extent of harm to which inmates housed in those tiers were \nexposed. Record Document 641 at 59. The Court’s opinion highlighted testimony by \nSecretary LeBlanc, where he admitted that the DOC had intended to cease the practice of \nrestrictive housing before the COVID-19 pandemic hit. Id.  \nDuring the remedy phase of trial, Secretary LeBlanc acknowledged the DOC’s \nawareness of the extent of harm posed by extended lockdown. Secretary LeBlanc again \nconceded that the DOC had intended to eliminate the practice of restrictive housing at \nDWCC. Secretary LeBlanc Remedy Trial Tr. vol. X at 2166:11-14 [Record Document \n713]. He also testified that the DOC had made changes to the conditions of extended \nlockdown at different DOC prisons across the state. Id. at 2148:1-2149:9. Among those \nchanges include the closing of the restrictive housing unit, “Camp J,” at the Louisiana State \nPenitentiary (also referred to as “Angola”); improvements in the conditions of confinement \nfor death row inmates housed at Angola, including congregated exercise time; and changes \nto the types of in-person programming available to inmates on restrictive housing at Elayn \nHunt Correctional Center (“EHCC”). Id. at 2137:8-2139:6. In fact, Secretary LeBlanc \nadmitted that it is better to allow inmates more time out of the cell than less. Id. at 2137:4-\n67 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 754   Filed 07/18/24   Page 70 of 172 PageID #: \n55230\n7.  Despite  this,  DWCC  has  made  no  significant  effort  to  remedy  the  constitutional \nviolations that were outlined in the Court’s prior ruling, nor have there been any attempts \nto introduce any of these pilot programs or policies at DWCC.   \nUltimately, officials at the DOC and DWCC still draft, amend, implement, and \nenforce the policies and practices that govern restrictive housing at DWCC. And yet, \ndespite their knowledge of the harms caused by these policies, DWCC has made no effort \nto change or remedy them.   \niii.  Conclusion as to Conditions of Confinement  \nIn summary, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have met their burden in proving that \nDefendants continue to subject inmates to mental torture and will continue to subject \ninmates to mental torture into the future by housing them in unconstitutional conditions on \nextended lockdown. In so doing, Plaintiffs have satisfied both the objective and subjective \ncomponents of the Eighth Amendment inquiry. As to the objective component, the Court \nholds that Plaintiffs have proven that Defendants failed to remedy the policies, practices, \nand procedures that subject inmates to cruel and unusual punishment. Moreover, the Court \nfinds that Defendants have failed to make any substantive changes to improve or mitigate \nthe psychological harms of extended lockdown, the harsh conditions of confinement, the \nindefinite length of time on extended lockdown, and the unconstitutional disciplinary \nprocedures in practice. These policies, practices, and procedures—which include: double \nbunking; the deprivation of any meaningful social interaction; the confinement of inmates \nto  their  cells  for  twenty-three  to  twenty-four  hours  a  day;  the  lack  of  meaningful \nrecreational activity; the lack of mental stimulation; the indefinite periods of assignment to \n68 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 754   Filed 07/18/24   Page 71 of 172 PageID #: \n55231\nextended housing; and the use of strip cell status—cause inmates, and especially those \nalready suffering from mental illness, to experience psychological pain and put them at risk \nof mental decompensation. By failing to remedy these policies, practices, and procedures, \nofficials at DWCC have demonstrated a wanton disregard for inmate health and safety.  \nThe Court finds that Plaintiffs are entitled to injunctive relief to remedy these \nunconstitutional conditions of confinement.  \nC. Delivery of Mental Health Services \nIn the liability phase ruling, the Court determined that Plaintiffs proved that DWCC \nprovided inmates housed on the South Compound with a constitutionally deficient level of \nmental health care and services. The Court held that DWCC failed to provide mental health \ncare that reached even a basic level of care, and identified systemic deficiencies in six areas \nof the mental health program: 1) screening and evaluations; 2) mental health treatment; 3) \nthe  staffing  of  the  mental  health  department;  4)  the  prescription  of  psychotropic \nmedications; 5) the record keeping practices; and 6) the suicide prevention program. The \nCourt also found that Defendants exhibited a wanton disregard for the mental health of \ninmates housed on the South Compound.  \nIn Estelle v. Gamble, the Supreme Court held that “deliberate indifference to a \nprisoner’s serious illness or injury states a cause of action under § 1983” because it \n“constitutes  the  unnecessary  and  wanton  infliction  of  pain  proscribed  by  the  Eighth \nAmendment.” 429 U.S. 97, 104-05 (1976) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \nThe inquiry is whether Defendants were “deliberate[ly] indifferen[t] to serious medical \nneeds.” Id. at 104.   \n69 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 754   Filed 07/18/24   Page 72 of 172 PageID #: \n55232\n“Medical treatment that is merely unsuccessful or negligent does not constitute \ndeliberate indifference, nor does a prisoner’s disagreement with his medical treatment, \nabsent exceptional circumstances.” Arenas, 922 F.3d at 620 (internal quotation marks and \ncitations omitted). “Rather, an inmate must show that the officials refused to treat him, \nignored his complaints, intentionally treated him incorrectly, or engaged in any similar \nconduct that would clearly evince a wanton disregard for any serious medical needs.” Id. \nat 620-21 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).   \nSystemic deficiencies in a prison’s mental healthcare system could support a finding \nof deliberate indifference at the institutional level. See Cook, 376 F.3d at 333 (“Conditions \nof confinement may establish an Eighth Amendment violation ‘in combination’ when each \nwould not do so alone, but only when they have a mutually enforcing effect that produces \nthe deprivation of a single, identifiable human need . . .” (citation omitted)). Plaintiffs can \nmeet their burden by showing “repeated examples of negligent acts which disclose a pattern \nof conduct by the prison medical staff . . . or by proving there are such systemic and gross \ndeficiencies in staffing, facilities, equipment, or procedures that the inmate population is \neffectively denied access to adequate medical care.” Ramos v. Lamm, 639 F.2d 559, 575 \n(10th Cir. 1980) (citations omitted). \ni.  Substantial Risk of Harm \nThe Court turns first to the objective test to determine whether DWCC’s deficient \nmental health services continue to constitute cruel and unusual punishment, and if so, \nwhether  these  constitutional  violations  are  likely  to  continue  into  the  future.  “The \ncomponents of a minimally adequate mental health treatment program may be ascertained \n70 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 754   Filed 07/18/24   Page 73 of 172 PageID #: \n55233\nby resort to judicial precedent in previous prison cases, by consideration of the expert \ntestimony in the instant case, and by applying the basic principles of minimally adequate \ncare to the specific problem of mental health care.” Ruiz v. Estelle, 503 F. Supp. 1265, 1339 \n(S.D. Tex. 1980), aff’d in part, rev’d in part on other grounds, 679 F.2d 1115 (5th Cir. \n1982). Ruiz identified the minimum criteria required for mental health care as: systematic \nscreening and evaluation; treatment that is more than mere seclusion or close supervision; \nparticipation by trained mental health professionals in appropriate numbers; safeguards \nagainst  psychotropic  medications  that  are  prescribed  in  dangerous  amounts,  without \nadequate supervision or otherwise inappropriately administered; accurate, complete, and \nconfidential records; and a suicide prevention program. Id. As has already been discussed, \nthe Court has identified systemic deficiencies in all of these areas in DWCC’s mental health \nprogram. The Court will address whether those deficiencies have been remedied below.  \n1.  Screening and Evaluation \nIn its liability phase opinion, the Court identified systemic deficiencies in the three \ndifferent  categories  of  screening  and  evaluations  available  to  inmates  in  segregated \nhousing: 1) intake screenings; 2) screenings during mental health rounds; and 3) screenings \nduring periodic evaluations, which include the mental health evaluations for inmates with \na LOC-2, -3, and -4 designation and the segregated housing interviews. Record Document \n641 at 63-64. After considering the evidence and testimony presented during the remedy \nphase of trial, the Court finds that DWCC failed to remedy the previously enunciated \ndeficiencies identified with each type of screening or evaluation. Plaintiffs proved that \nthese deficiencies continue to persist and will continue to persist into the future.   \n71 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 754   Filed 07/18/24   Page 74 of 172 PageID #: \n55234\na.  Screening and Evaluation During Intake \nDuring the liability phase of trial, the Court held that there were “severe systemic \ndeficiencies” in the intake screening and evaluations conducted at DWCC because: 1) \nHayden lacked the training and certification to complete the screenings; 2) Deputy Warden \nDauzat failed to conduct routine, timely, and thorough audits of Hayden’s screenings; 3) \nthe were no discussions or investigations into the discrepancies between the records from \nEHCC and the information that was self-reported by the inmates; 4) the referrals to Dr. \nSeal were inconsistent; and 5) inmates’ needs were not individually considered upon \nintake, especially those whose mental health conditions may have exacerbated without \nproper attention. Id. at 74.  \nAs the Court detailed in its liability phase opinion, both the inter-system44 and intra-\nsystem transfer inmates must receive a mental health screening upon arrival at DWCC. Id. \nat 64. During the remedy phase of trial, the parties stipulated that the processes and \nprocedures to complete the intra-system intake screening were the same as those described \nduring the liability phase. Ex. JR-60 at ¶ 50. As the Court outlined in that opinion,  \nThe process begins with Hayden observing the inmates as they get off the bus \nthat transported them to DWCC. Intra-system transfers arrive at the facility \nwith their records, which are directly loaded into “medical.” Hayden then \nindividually  observes  each  inmate  as  they  make  it  through  the  security \nprocess. At the top of an intra-system inmate’s mental health screening form \nis  a  series  of  pre-populated  background  information  from  the  CAJUN \n \n44 The parties did not present any evidence or testimony regarding the inter-system intake \nscreenings  at  DWCC.  However,  inter-system  transfers  and  intra-system  transfers  are \nprovided with the same mental health screening upon their immediate arrival at DWCC. \nSee Record Document 641 at 64. As such, the Court finds that the deficiencies in the inter-\nsystem screening exist to the same extent they exist in the intra-system intake screening \nprocess.  \n72 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 754   Filed 07/18/24   Page 75 of 172 PageID #: \n55235\ndatabase, including the “Mental Health Code Upon Arrival.” Those codes are \n“SH”  or  suicidal  history,  “DD”  or  developmental  disability,  “SA”  or \nsubstance abuse, “SX” or designation as an adjudicated sex offender, “AX” \nor Axis I diagnosis (which means a diagnosis of a mental health condition that \nmay be treated by medication), “PM” or current prescription of psychotropic \nmedications, and “LOC” to designate which Level of Care this individual was \nidentified as requiring. There is also a label after those codes to indicate their \napplicability  to  the  inmate.  “P”  stands  for  present,  indicating  that  the \nindividual has that classification, “d” stands for dependency, and “x” stands \nfor “none indicated.” Hayden testified that he then notes any observations \nregarding behavior and intelligence and will conduct a “verbal interview,” \nwhere he asks questions about past and present suicidal ideation/behavior and \ncurrent mental health symptoms. The answers to those specific questions are \nself-reported, and there is no way for Hayden to verify the information for \naccuracy. Hayden then testified that he will only refer an inmate to Dr. Seal \nfor further consultation if he finds that there are “red flags,” like a present \nmental health diagnosis or prescription of psychotropic medications. Hayden \ngenerally refers all patients to general population, regardless of their level of \ncare; however, it is the classification review board, a group with no mental \nhealth staff involvement, that ultimately decides where an inmate is housed.  \nRecord Document 641 at 66-67 (internal citations omitted).  \nThe only change made to the intake process is that the medical and mental health \nrecords  from  the  inmate’s  previous  institution  and/or  from  the  receiving/diagnostic \ninstitution are available to the mental health clinician before the inmate’s intake screening. \nHayden Remedy Trial Tr. vol. V at 993:18-994:7 [Record Document 708]. Otherwise, \nthere have been no other changes made to the intake process. Id. at 994:17-19; Burgos \nRemedy Trial Tr. vol. III at 698:7-12 [Record Document 706]. Hayden continues to be the \nprimary  individual  tasked  with  the  intake  process,  despite  his  lack  of  credentials  or \nlicensing to be qualified to do so. Hayden Remedy Trial Tr. vol. V at 993:14-17 [Record \nDocument 708]. Burgos will conduct intake interviews “as needed.” Burgos Remedy Trial \nTr. vol. III at 698:7-10 [Record Document 706]. \n73 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 754   Filed 07/18/24   Page 76 of 172 PageID #: \n55236\nPreviously, the Court found that Hayden lacked the training and certification to \ncomplete the initial intake screenings. Specifically, the Court determined that Hayden’s \ndegree in industrial psychology was irrelevant to his role at DWCC. Id. at 67-68. Hayden \ntestified that he has not acquired any new licenses or certifications or earned any additional \ndegrees since the liability phase of trial. Hayden Remedy Trial Tr. vol. V at 960:20-25 \n[Record Document 708]. As such, Plaintiffs proved that Hayden is still unqualified to \nconduct the intake interviews. DWCC has not remedied this issue.45 \nThe  Court  also  found  that  the  actual  screening  process  itself,  as  well  as  the \ncorresponding documentation, were “wholly inadequate.” Record Document 641 at 70. \nSpecifically, Dr. Burns credibly established that there were defects in: the form used by \nHayden to document the intake screening; the manner in which Hayden filled out the form; \nand the adequacy of the screening’s assessment. Id. Hayden testified that there have been \nno changes to the actual form that he fills out during an intake screening.46 Hayden Remedy \n \n45 In its liability phase opinion, the Court identified several instances in which it was \nobvious that Hayden’s lack of training and education impacted his ability to adequately \ncomplete intake screenings. The first was when he misdiagnosed an offender with major \ndepressive disorder, as opposed to Dr. Seal’s diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder. Record \nDocument  641 at 68.  Hayden  was also unable to properly identify the “oriented x” \ndesignations. Id. at 70. Dr. Burns opined that the misdiagnosis was emblematic of Hayden’s \nlack of understanding of medical convention, psychiatric symptoms and diagnoses, and \ntreatment. Id. at 68-70.  \n46 Plaintiffs did not contest this assertion; however, the Court questions whether there was \na change made to the form in 2018, a change that was not addressed during the liability \nphase of trial. Only a single mental health screening form was admitted into evidence \nduring the remedy phase of trial, a form that appears different from any other that the Court \nhad reviewed during the liability phase of trial. The previous iteration of the form that the \nCourt reviewed—which appears to have been enacted in February 2003—prompts the \nintake  officer  to  note  an  inmate’s  sentence  length;  LOC;  education;  whether  he  is \nexperiencing hallucinations or delusions; his speech; his intelligence; and the inmate’s \n74 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 754   Filed 07/18/24   Page 77 of 172 PageID #: \n55237\nTrial Tr. vol. V at 995:17-19 [Record Document 708]. Defendants have failed to cure the \ndeficient form used during intake and that Plaintiffs proved that the deficiencies with the \nform continue to persist and will continue to persist into the future.  \nThe Court also finds that Hayden has not remedied the deficient manner in which \nhe fills out the intake forms. Previously, the Court determined that Hayden’s input on the \nforms was inconsistent with the information prepopulated from the CAJUN database and \nthat Hayden would not ask any follow-up questions to probe into the discrepancies between \nthe information provided by the CAJUN system and the inmate’s own responses. Record \nDocument 641 at 71. During the remedy phase of trial, Plaintiffs offered an intake form \nfilled out by Hayden on October 26, 2020. The form indicates that inmate B.H.47 was \ndiagnosed with a “mood disorder” in 2020 at EHCC and was prescribed Buspar to treat it. \nEx. PR-B-16 [Record Document 716-25]. The form also indicates that B.H. had a history \nof attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), with which he was diagnosed in 1995 \nand  was  prescribed  Ritalin.  Id.  However,  Hayden  did  not  provide  any  additional \ninformation regarding the nature of B.H.’s “mood disorder,” any further context about \nthese diagnoses, any indication that the inmate sought or received therapy or counseling to \n \nmental health code upon arrival (e.g., whether an inmate is experiencing or has had a \nhistory of substance abuse, etc.). See Ex. P-DD-01 [Record Document 564-108]. The form \nthat the Court reviewed during the remedy phase of trial does not include those questions. \nCompare id., with Ex. PR-B-16 [Record Document 716-25]. The Court observes that the \nmental health screening it reviewed during the remedy phase of trial was less thorough and \nasked less questions about the inmate’s mental health than the forms it evaluated during \nthe liability phase of trial. \n47 Out of respect to the sensitive nature of this discussion and the information it reveals \ntherein, the inmate’s name will not be disclosed here. \n75 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 754   Filed 07/18/24   Page 78 of 172 PageID #: \n55238\nmitigate symptoms, or any information as to the effectiveness of the medication he was \nprescribed to treat his mood disorder.  \nIn its liability phase opinion, the Court determined that a qualified official at \nDWCC, namely, Deputy Warden Dauzat, needed to timely and routinely audit Hayden’s \nintake screenings because he lacked the requisite training and certification to complete \nthem. Record Document 641 at 68. Despite this, the Court found that no official at DWCC \nconducted a thorough audit of Hayden’s work. Id. Instead, the Court found that Deputy \nWarden Dauzat simply wrote “follow up per policy” on each and every one of Hayden’s \nintake screenings. Id. at 73.  \nDuring the remedy phase of trial, the Court observed that Deputy Warden Dauzat \ncontinued to simply mark “follow up per policy” on Hayden’s intake forms. See Ex. PR-\nB-16  [Record  Document  716-25].  This  failure  to  audit  an  unqualified  mental  health \npractitioner’s work puts inmates—especially those who are already exhibiting signs of \nmental decompensation—at a significant risk of harm.  \nb.  Evaluation During Weekly Mental Health Rounds \nDuring the liability phase of trial, the Court learned that DWCC did not conduct or \ndocument its weekly mental health rounds as required by policy. This blatant disregard of \nwritten policy can put an inmate and those around him at risk and demonstrates deliberate \nindifference to the mental health needs of the inmates on extended lockdown. Record \nDocument 641 at 78. The Court held that weekly rounds and the evaluation process that \noccurred during those weekly rounds were systemically deficient. Specifically, the Court \nfound that mental health staff did not individually visit with each LOC-3 or LOC-4 inmate \n76 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 754   Filed 07/18/24   Page 79 of 172 PageID #: \n55239\nat least once a week through weekly rounds as required by policy and held that the practice \nof merely walking through the tier did not satisfy this requirement.  \nDuring the remedy phase of trial, the Court learned that the process by which the \nmental health clinicians conduct their weekly rounds has not materially changed. As \nBurgos explained, every week he conducts weekly rounds on the tiers to which he is \nassigned. Burgos Remedy Trial Tr. vol. V at 918:11-919:13 [Record Document 708]. He \nonly documents when he has “a specific conversation with an individual.” Id. at 919:14-\n19. If this occurs, Burgos will fill out a Form 350.48 Id. at 919:20-22. If an inmate requests \nprivacy, or if Burgos gets the impression that the subject is sensitive in nature, he might \nhave the discussion in a private setting; otherwise, all conversations take place cell front. \nId. at 920:17-921:6. Burgos stated that the new badge swipe system will record his presence \non the tier if he does not speak to any inmate during a round that would require any \ndocumentation.49 Id. at 919:9-13. \nDr.  Burns  testified  that  inmates  saw  mental  health  staff  on  the  tiers  “more \nconsistently” since the liability phase of trial. Burns Remedy Trial Tr. vol. VII at 1640:18-\n23 [Record Document 710].  However, as  Burgos’s testimony highlights, there  is no \nindication or documentation that mental health clinicians take the time to stop at every cell \n \n48 The mental health department began utilizing a new form, known as the Form 350, in \nJune 2022. Hayden Remedy Trial Tr. vol. V at 1061:14-23 [Record Document 708]. The \nCourt will discuss the Form 350 in greater depth in a later section. \n49 The badge system, known as BadgePass, is new to DWCC since the liability phase of \ntrial. Goodwin Remedy Trial Tr. vol. IX at 1896:18-1897:11. However, as the Court will \nfurther enunciate, the mere fact that it electronically records when the mental health \nclinicians are on the tiers is insufficient to prove that the deficiencies with the weekly \nrounds has been cured.  \n77 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 754   Filed 07/18/24   Page 80 of 172 PageID #: \n55240\nand/or attempt to engage, even briefly, with each inmate. As Dr. Burns testified, DWCC \nofficials “did not describe stopping at every cell to check in with every inmate. They \nstopped when someone called them over to talk with them as opposed to stopping at every \ncell, inquiring how people were doing, making eye contact, looking at the contents of the \ncell, et cetera.” Id. 1544:11-15. According to Dr. Burns, mental health staff should be \nstopping at every cell because \n. . . when people who have a serious mental illness are decompensating, \nsometimes they take less care about their personal appearance, their hygiene. \nThey become withdrawn. They’re not taking care of their property. And so \nthe condition of the cell, particularly if something changes, like all along the \ncells look fine, and then suddenly there is leftover food in there, there is a \npaper on the floor, the bed is not made, everything is dirty, it . . . can be an \nindication of some social withdrawal and isolation and a manifestation of a \nserious mental illness. You would also ask about whether the person is \nroutinely going out for recreation, whether they are participating in groups. \nYou often spend time with the tier officer to ask if people are sleeping, if \nanybody’s up all night keeping other people up. So you want to try and get a \npicture of how the person is doing from the records that are kept and \nmaintained by the department, the observations of the officers, as well as \nyour own observations about how the person is taking care of [himself]. \nId. at 1544:18-1545:12. \nIn summary, the Court finds that Defendants have failed to meet their burden in \nproving that the previously enunciated deficiencies with the weekly rounds have been \nremedied. In fact, the only evidence that Defendants presented was proof of a newly \nimplemented badge system, which merely tracks who is on the tier. It does not record the \nnature  of  the  visit  or  with  whom  the  individual  actually  met.  Plaintiffs  successfully \ndemonstrated that the deficient conditions continue to persist and will continue to persist \ninto the future.  \n78 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 754   Filed 07/18/24   Page 81 of 172 PageID #: \n55241\nc.  Periodic Evaluations \nDuring the liability phase of trial, the Court found there to be systemic deficiencies \nin the ways in which DWCC conducts its periodic evaluations of inmates in restrictive \nhousing. Record Document 641 at 78-86. There are two types of periodic evaluations that \nmental health clinicians at DWCC must conduct: 1) mandatory mental health evaluations \nfor  inmates  designated  as  LOC-2,  -3,  or  -4;  and  2)  mandatory  segregated  housing \nevaluations for inmates who have been assigned to segregated housing for a period greater \nthan thirty days. The Court will address each in turn below. \ni.  Mandatory Mental Health Evaluations \nIn its liability phase opinion, the Court held that DWCC did not conduct the \nmandatory mental health evaluations of its inmates with a LOC-2, LOC-3, and LOC-4 \nclassification. Record Document 641 at 78. DWCC policy required that mental health staff \nmake individualized contact with inmates designated as LOC-2, -3, or -4 every 30, 90, and \n180 days, respectively. Id. at 79.  These mental health assessments were supposed to be \nconducted separate and apart from the mandatory periodic segregated housing interviews. \nImpeding the ability to conduct these mandatory mental health evaluations was the fact \nthat DWCC failed to maintain a list or roster of inmates on the mental health caseload to \ntrack the tier to which the inmate was assigned. Id.  \nDuring the remedy phase of trial, the Court learned that mental health staff are still \nrequired to make individualized contact with LOC-2, -3, and -4 inmates every 30, 90, and \n180 days, respectively. See Ex. JR-15 at 6-7 [Record Document 715-15]. Defendants claim \nthat inmates are provided with these individual contacts within the prescribed period.  \n79 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 754   Filed 07/18/24   Page 82 of 172 PageID #: \n55242\nIn June 2022, the mental health staff began documenting all meetings with inmates, \nregardless of their purpose, on a new version of the Form 350. Hayden Remedy Trial Tr. \nvol. V at 1061:14-23 [Record Document 708]. That is, the same form is used for both the \nmandatory mental health evaluations for those inmates assigned to a LOC-2, -3, and -4, \nand for those inmates who are in segregated housing for more than thirty days. The Form \n350 offers a primary and secondary purpose for the meeting which the mental health \nclinician can choose from a drop-down list. See e.g.., Ex. PR-S-1 at 535 [Record Document \n716-132]. The clinician can then provide a summary of the purpose of the visit. Id. The \nform then gives the clinician a list to check off his objective findings, before providing a \nspot for the assessment and plan. Id. \nHowever, as the Court learned, mental health clinicians use one meeting with an \ninmate to claim that several types of mandatory evaluations or assessments took place \nduring that contact without any narrative or documentation to reflect or support this \nassertion. When asked by the Court whether a Form 350 reflected that a segregated housing \ninterview or a LOC follow-up interview took place, Hayden simply responded that “it was \nboth” that had taken place. Hayden Remedy Trial Tr. vol. V at 1063:17-21 [Record \nDocument 708]. This practice of using one visit by a mental health clinician to complete \ntwo different, required sessions is also one that is reflected in the Form 350s themselves. \nSee e.g., Ex. PR-S-1 at 485, 518, 519, 535, 581, 593, 625, 699 [Record Documents 716-\n132 and 716-134]. Not only do the forms indicate that the  meeting served multiple \npurposes, but the narrative notes also leave it unclear whether there were specific questions \nasked pertaining to the inmate’s level of care. In fact, the only indication that a LOC or \n80 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 754   Filed 07/18/24   Page 83 of 172 PageID #: \n55243\nsegregated housing evaluation took place would be on the drop-down menu or under the \n“plan.”  Otherwise,  the  forms  are  non-specific  and  do  not  provide  any  substantive \ninformation other than the inmate’s immediate appearance and general disposition. They \ndo not indicate whether the level of care is appropriate; they do not document whether there \nare any signs of decompensation as a result of segregated housing status; and they do not \nmention progress towards the completion of treatment plan goals. In summary, while the \nForm 350s certainly memorialize that an interaction took place, the actual notes and \ndocumentation of those meetings do not clarify the true substance or nature of the meetings.  \nDr.  Burns  opined  that  documenting  all  inmate  contacts  on  the  Form  350s  is \n“problematic because not all contacts are the same.” Burns Remedy Trial Tr. vol. VII at \n1546:7-14 [Record Document 710]. For example, Dr. Burns testified that “if you are doing \nan individual counseling session, you would expect there would be some detail about what \nthe counseling session was about, as opposed to just that form with those check-off boxes.” \nId. at 1547:5-8. In other words, because different types of evaluations and inmate meetings \ninvolve different assessments and levels of documentation, to rely upon a universal form \nfor documentation will necessarily mean that the questions and assessments that are \nrequired for each individual meeting will not be included in the form. Id. at 1546:14-\n1547:21. As such, the Court does not find that the implementation of the Form 350 proves \nthat the mandatory mental health evaluations actually take place.  \nThe Court was not provided with any evidence that the LOC interviews took place \nprior to the implementation of the Form 350 in June 2022. There was no mention of the \nindividualized interviews on the mental health form nor did the summaries of the meetings \n81 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 754   Filed 07/18/24   Page 84 of 172 PageID #: \n55244\nallude to any questions or conversations that would indicate that the meeting was meant to \nserve the purpose of a mental health evaluation. See e.g., Ex. PR-S-1 at 392 [Record \nDocument 716-133]. In other words, prior to the implementation of the Form 350s in June \n2022, there was still no indication that these LOC interviews were taking place.  \nNext, the Court will turn to the LOC lists.50 During the remedy phase of trial, the \nCourt learned that Robinson provided the key officer with a “LOC list.” To compile the \nlist, Robinson generates a list of inmates from the face sheets on the Lotus Notes database. \nRobinson Remedy Trial Tr. vol. IX at 2031:19-24, 2032:8-20 [Record Document 712]. \nRobinson then distributes the list weekly. Id. at 2032:6-7. However, in their remedy trial \ntestimony, Deputy Warden Dauzat and Robinson disagreed as to which LOC designations \nshould  be  included  on  that  list.  Deputy  Warden  Dauzat  was  unable  to  conclusively \narticulate which LOC classifications needed to be included in the list provided to security \nstaff. For example, she first testified that a list of all individuals classified as LOC-3 and \nLOC-4 needed to be sent to security staff every Monday; however, she later testified that \nonly those inmates with a LOC-3 designation are included on the list. Compare Dauzat \nRemedy Trial Tr. vol. VI at 1279:8-11 [Record Document 709], with Dauzat Remedy Trial \nTr. vol. VI at 2468:2-10 [Record Document 717]. Meanwhile, Robinson testified that she \nonly provided security and medical staff with a list of those inmates classified as LOC-3. \nRobinson Remedy Trial Tr. vol. IX at 2031:11-16 [Record Document 712]. \n \n50 As a reminder, the LOC lists are different from the heat pathology lists provided to \nsecurity personnel, which the Court will address in greater depth in a later section of this \nopinion.  \n82 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 754   Filed 07/18/24   Page 85 of 172 PageID #: \n55245\nThe evidence supports Defendants’ assertion that it is now providing security staff \nwith a list of inmates who are classified as LOC-3; however, the testimony also made it \nclear that security staff are not provided with a list of inmates on LOC-4. There is also not \nan adequate level of oversight over that process. As such, the Court finds that DWCC has \nfailed to remedy this issue as it pertains to the inmates with a LOC-4 designation.   \nIn summary, the Court does not find that Defendants have met their burden in \nproving that they have remedied the lack of individualized mental health evaluations for \ninmates who are classified as LOC-2, -3, and -4. First, the Court finds that DWCC does \nnot provide security staff with a list of inmates classified as LOC-4. Additionally, it is not \nclear that the individualized contacts actually take place as mandated by policy. Certainly, \nas of June 2022, the mental health clinicians were checking a drop-down menu to show \nthat a meeting served that purpose; however, none of the actual narratives showed any \ndiscussions pertaining to level of care or otherwise indicated that these meetings actually \ntook place. Instead, it appears as though the mental health staff were using one meeting \nwith an inmate to essentially check off any meetings required within that same period. Prior \nto that, there is no documentation to reflect that these meetings were taking place. In other \nwords,  Defendants  were  not  able  to  produce  any  evidence  that  these  mental  health \nevaluations actually take place other than them being a selectable option in the drop-down \nmenu. It is clear that the meetings are not serving any therapeutic or evaluative function. \nAs noted above, the Court had identified these deficiencies in its liability opinion. Despite \nthese findings, the only change that was made was the creation of a new multi-purpose \nform.  Thus,  the  Court  finds  that  Defendants  have  failed  to  remedy  these  systemic \n83 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 754   Filed 07/18/24   Page 86 of 172 PageID #: \n55246\ndeficiencies. And importantly, Defendants; failure illustrates a lack of commitment to the \ntrue provision of mental health services mandated by its own policies. Instead, Defendants \nhave concentrated their efforts on documentation, and have failed at this task as well with \nan inadequate, multi-purpose form. Moreover, Plaintiffs successfully demonstrated that \nthese deficiencies continue to persist and will continue to persist into the future.  \nii.  Mandatory Segregated Housing Evaluations \nAs to the second type of periodic evaluation, the mandatory segregated housing \nevaluation, the Court previously identified systemic deficiencies in the following three \nareas: 1) Hayden’s lack of qualification to conduct the interviews and the lack of audit \nand/or oversight over his work; 2) the non-confidential nature of the cell-front interviews; \nand  3)  the  inadequacy  of  the  assessments  themselves  and  their  corresponding \ndocumentation. Record Document 641 at 80-86. Inmates on extended lockdown with a \n“diagnosed behavioral health disorder” will receive a “behavioral health assessment” at \nleast every thirty days. Id. at 10. Inmates without a diagnosed behavioral health disorder \nwill receive a behavioral health assessment every ninety days.51 Id.  \nAs it mentioned, the Court previously found that Hayden lacked the qualifications \nto conduct the segregated inmate interviews; additionally, his work was not supervised or \noverseen by a qualified mental health clinician. As evidenced by the Form 350s reviewed \n \n51 The Court finds that the existence of this policy belies Defendants’ continued assertion \nthat a prolonged stay in segregated housing does not adversely impact an inmate’s mental \nhealth.  If  this  was  the  case,  then  why  would  DWCC  require  routine  mental  health \nevaluations for inmates in segregated housing, both for those with and those without a \ndiagnosed mental illness.  \n84 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 754   Filed 07/18/24   Page 87 of 172 PageID #: \n55247\nby the Court, Hayden still conducts segregated housing interviews. See e.g., Ex. PR-S-1 at \n32, 155, 233, 381, 535-36, 593-94, and 625-26 [Record Document 716-132]. There is no \nindication  that  Burgos  or  Deputy  Warden  Dauzat—individuals  who  are  certified  to \nsupervise other mental health clinicians—signed off on Hayden’s work, nor was there any \ntestimony to show that his work is audited. As such, Defendants have failed to remedy this \nissue.  \nThe Court also identified the non-confidential nature of the segregated housing \ninterviews as a practice that precludes an inmate from obtaining mental health treatment. \nDuring the liability phase, the Court learned that the segregated housing interviews took \nplace cell-front. Record Document 641 at 82-83. The Court agreed with Dr. Burns’s \nopinion that these interviews would be better suited in a confidential environment to ensure \nthat the inmate is free to discuss the state of his mental health without revealing private \ninformation and/or without fear of retaliation. Id. at 82.  \nDefendants did not offer any evidence to prove that they have remedied the issue of \nthe non-confidential nature of the segregated housing interviews. As Dr. Burns testified, \nthe forms do not make it clear where the contacts are taking place. Burns Remedy Trial Tr. \nvol. VII at 1549:3-1550:3 [Record Document 710]. She further opined that something \ncould  easily  be  implemented  on  a  form  to  demonstrate  whether  the  meetings  are \nconfidential, such as a “check-off box about why it was in cell or out of cell, and if it is in \ncell, the rationale for why it was in cell should be provided.” Id. at 1549:20-22. From an \noperations and security standpoint, this would help security staff know the number of staff \nrequired to accompany mental health clinicians during their sessions. Id. at 1549:22-\n85 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 754   Filed 07/18/24   Page 88 of 172 PageID #: \n55248\n1550:03. From a mental health treatment standpoint, this gives inmates an “opportunity for \nprivacy in their mental health contacts and treatment interventions.” Id. The Court was \npersuaded by Dr. Burns’s opinion. Certainly, there was no mention of the confidential \nnature of the interviews on the Form 350s or prior versions of the interview forms. Nor did \nthe clinicians indicate that they were only holding sessions in a confidential environment. \nAs such, the Court finds that Defendants were unable to prove that they have remedied this \ndeficiency. Plaintiffs proved that the deficiency persists and is likely to persist into the \nfuture.  \nFinally, the Court turns to the adequacy of the assessments themselves and the \ncorresponding  documentation.  These  deficiencies  exist  in  addition  to  the  already \nenumerated systemic problems. See supra pp. 75-76. During the liability phase of trial, the \nCourt determined that there was no documented evidence of any actual mental health status \nexamination having taken place during the thirty- and ninety-day segregated housing \ninterviews.  Record  Document  641  at  83.  Specifically,  the  Court  found  the  periodic \nassessments occurred en masse, with clinicians completing dozens of assessments on the \nsame date. Record Document 641 at 85. Moreover, the assessments lacked any substantive \ninformation about the inmates’ conditions or mental health status. Id. at 83-84.  \nThe Court holds that, as of the close of the August 2022 discovery period, the \nsegregated housing assessments were still being completed en masse. That is, clinicians \ncontinue to fill out a large number of forms on many different inmates in one day, as \nopposed to filling out the forms to document a specific evaluation. This evidence confirms \nthat the evaluations are not taking place as required. For example, on March 2, 2022, \n86 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 754   Filed 07/18/24   Page 89 of 172 PageID #: \n55249\nBurgos completed fifty-three segregated housing assessments. See Record Document PR-\nS-1 at 392-444 [Record Document 716-133]. As Dr. Burns testified during the liability \nphase of trial, each of these assessments should take at least ten to fifteen minutes in order \nto ask all the required questions and complete all the requisite assessments, excluding the \ntime it would take an inmate to be escorted to and from a confidential setting. Burns \nLiability Trial Tr. vol. V at 1320:1-6 [Record Document 539]. Clearly, Burgos is not \nspending this amount of time with the inmates; if so, he would have spent over eight hours \ncompleting ten-minute segregated housing assessments, excluding how long it would take \nto then document every interaction. The forms from these visits are also nearly identical, \nif not identical.  The almost identical nature of the content from one inmate’s assessment \nto another belies Defendants’ assertion that these assessments are individualized. \nIn  summary,  the  Court  finds  that  Defendants  failed  to  remedy  the  previously \nidentified  systemic  deficiencies  pertaining  to  the  segregated  housing.  Conversely, \nPlaintiffs have met their burden in demonstrating that these systemic deficiencies with \nregard to the screenings and evaluations at DWCC continue to persist and will continue to \npersist into the future.  \n2.  Mental Health Treatment \na.  Individualization of Treatment \nDuring the liability phase, the Court found that DWCC failed to create meaningful, \nindividualized treatment plans for its inmates with a diagnosed mental illness. Record \nDocument  641  at  89.  Specifically,  the  Court  learned  that  DWCC  did  not  create \n87 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 754   Filed 07/18/24   Page 90 of 172 PageID #: \n55250\nindividualized  treatment  plans  for  its  inmates,  despite  DWCC  policy  requiring  their \nimplementation. Id. at 88.  \nDuring the remedy phase of trial, Defendants presented evidence that they claimed \nproved that treatment plans have been individualized since 2021. See e.g., Burgos Remedy \nTrial Tr. vol. III at 700:7-9 [Record Document 706]. According to Burgos, a mental health \nprovider is tasked with creating the mental health treatment plans for the inmates classified \nas a LOC-3 or -4 on his caseload. Burgos Remedy Trial Tr. vol. III at 698:16-699:1 [Record \nDocument 706]. Individualized treatment plans must list the inmate’s diagnosis, outline \ngoals, list any prescribed medication(s), and indicate whether there are any issues with \nmedication non-compliance. Id. at 699:21-700:6.  \nThe Court finds that the implementation and use of these treatment plans are \ncertainly an improvement. However, as it will further explain below, the Court does not \nbelieve that the current versions of the treatment plans are adequate and have remedied the \ndeficiencies that were enunciated in the liability phase of trial. Instead, the Court finds that \nthis implementation of those treatment plans is another example of DWCC’s tendency to \nsimply “go through the motions.”  \nFirst, the Court finds that the treatment plans are not sufficiently individualized. The \nCourt reviewed several treatment plans. The top of the plan lists the inmate’s name, \ndiagnostic impression, LOC classification, and service code. See e.g., Ex. PR-B-1 at 74 \n[Record Document 716-11]. The plans contain four columns, wherein a need area is \nidentified, goals are created to treat that need area, an action plan is implemented to attain \nthose goals, and the staff members who are relevant to that action plan are identified. Id. \n88 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 754   Filed 07/18/24   Page 91 of 172 PageID #: \n55251\nAt the bottom of the page is a place to notate the implementation date, the date of the next \nreview, a signature line for the inmate, the name and signature from the assigned mental \nhealth clinician, and a signature from the supervisor who reviewed the plan. Id.  \nInmate B.A.’s mental health records provide an example of these inadequate mental \nhealth treatment plans. On May 20, 2021, Burgos created the mental health treatment plan \nfor B.A. Id. B.A. was identified as having schizoaffective disorder and was classified as a \nLOC-3. Id. The plan then lists B.A.’s need areas, goals, action plans, and the responsible \nDWCC staff members who—apart from the mental health clinician—did not provide any \nfeedback or opinion regarding the inmate’s treatment plan. Id. To better illustrate its \nfindings, the Court includes a portion of the mental health treatment plan below:  \n \nId. The treatment plan was signed by B.A., reviewed by Hayden, and sets a review date of \nMay 20, 2022. Id.  \n89 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 754   Filed 07/18/24   Page 92 of 172 PageID #: \n55252\nOn December 16, 2021, Burgos implemented a second treatment plan for inmate \nB.A. See Ex. PR-B-1 at 1 [Record Document 718-21]. On this plan, inmate B.A. is \ndiagnosed with panic disorder—not schizoaffective disorder—and is classified as a LOC-\n4.  Id. According to Burgos, changes to treatment plans outside of the one-year review \nperiod occur when there has been a change in diagnosis, symptomatic behaviors, or \nmedication compliance, to name a few. Burgos Remedy Trial Tr. vol V at 933:4-14 [Record \nDocument 708]. In B.A.’s case, the second treatment plan was created when Dr. Seal \nchanged B.A.’s diagnosis from schizoaffective disorder to panic disorder. Id. at 935:8-\n936:4. The Court includes the same portion of B.A.’s changed treatment plan below:  \n \nSee Ex. PR-B-1 at 1 [Record Document 718-21]. The only changes between the May and \nDecember treatment plans pertain to B.A.’s change in diagnosis. And even then, a majority \nof the goals and the action plans remained the same.  \n90 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 754   Filed 07/18/24   Page 93 of 172 PageID #: \n55253\n  The Court was also provided with the treatment plan for inmate D.O. See Ex. PR-\nB-27 at 1 [Record Document 716-34]. At the time, inmate D.O. was diagnosed with \nschizophrenia disorder and was classified as LOC-3. Id. The plan, implemented on April \n13, 2022, was signed by D.O. and Burgos, and was reviewed by Hayden. Id. The Court \nincludes a portion of D.O.’s treatment plan below: \n \nId. In comparing the May 2021 goals from B.A.’s treatment plan to D.O.’s April 2022 \ntreatment plan, the Court observes that many of the need areas, goals, and action plans are \nsimilar to one another. Many of the goals are copy and paste and use almost identical \nlanguage and abbreviations. The Court doubts the extent to which an inmate’s input is truly \nconsidered or how individualized these plans are to the needs of each inmate.  \n  The Court also learned that members of the mental health department were not \nprovided any training on these treatment plans. Dauzat Remedy Trial Tr. vol. VI at 1199:9-\n12 [Record Document 709]. As such, there is no written or formalized documentation that \nenunciates how the treatment plans should be filled out or that standardizes the content of \nthe meetings with inmates. This is not just an issue at the institutional level, but at the \n91 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 754   Filed 07/18/24   Page 94 of 172 PageID #: \n55254\ndepartmental  level  as  well.  According  to  Deputy  Warden  Dauzat,  the  DOC  has  not \nimplemented a standard form across all facilities that mandates how treatment plans are \ncreated. Id. at 1198:14-21. In summary, DWCC does not implement base-level standards \ngoverning their treatment plans, which can result in variations between different inmates’ \ncare, nor is there a mechanism by which the DOC is able to audit or regulate the treatment \nplans in place at the institutional level.  \n  Furthermore, despite multiple prison officials being listed as responsible staff, and \ndespite the necessary diagnosis from Dr. Seal, the only two individuals that take part in \ncrafting the treatment plan are the mental health clinician and the inmate. Nor does Dr. Seal \nreview the treatment plans in preparation for an appointment with an inmate. Seal Remedy \nTrial Tr. vol. III at 669:11-13 [Record Document 706]. There was no evidence presented \nthat would prove that Dr. Seal has ever reviewed a treatment plan. Dr. Burns recommended \nthat all members of that inmate’s treatment team—including Dr. Seal—be involved in the \ndevelopment of his treatment plan. Burns Remedy Trial Tr. vol. VII at 1582:7-15 [Record \nDocument 710]. In other words, the treatment plans do not contain the most comprehensive \ninput regarding the goals that would best promote an inmate’s success.  \n  Additionally, as this Court has already observed, Hayden signs off as the supervisor \napproving the mental health treatment plans. In fact, despite being head of the mental health \ndepartment, Deputy Warden Dauzat does not sign off on any of the treatment plans and has \nnot since 2021. Dauzat Remedy Trial Tr. vol. VI at 1197:7-17 [Record Document 709]. \nHowever, as this Court has already enunciated, Hayden is not qualified to supervise the \nother clinicians’ work.  \n92 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 754   Filed 07/18/24   Page 95 of 172 PageID #: \n55255\n  Finally, the treatment plans fail to include any metrics or key performance indicators \nto measure an inmate’s success in meeting the goals or action plans that are listed on the \ntreatment plan. The lack of these metrics and/or basic data collection does not allow an \ninmate to know the extent to which he has progressed in his treatment plans, nor is an \ninmate made aware when he has failed to make progress towards his treatment plan’s goals \nand action plans. In other words, the annual review is the only mechanism by which the \ninmate is guaranteed a meeting regarding the status of his treatment plan, and even so, an \ninmate may not receive any substantive feedback on his progress. This is another example \nof how inmates are oftentimes left unaware and uninformed of the requirements needed to \nbe completed so that they may transition out of segregated housing. Certainly, the Court \ncould envision that an inmate who is compliant with his treatment plan would be eligible \nto transition out of segregated housing, and yet, there is no evidence that this is the case.  \nDr.  Burns  also  opined  that  the  treatment  plans  do  not  include  measurable  or \nachievable goals. Burns Remedy Trial Tr. vol. VII at 1584:12-18 [Record Document 710]. \nNor did she observe any follow-up by a mental health clinician when an inmate’s “general \ngoals” were not attained. Id. at 1584:19-1585:5. For example, an inmate may have a general \ngoal  of  “medication  compliance,”  a  goal  for  any  inmate  taking  medication.  But  his \ntreatment plan will not indicate whether an inmate has refused medication and at what \nfrequency; whether medication compliance counseling is provided in instances of non-\ncompliance; or whether there were specific objectives to help an inmate attain that goal. \nId. In conclusion, the treatment plans lack any means by which the mental health clinicians \n93 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 754   Filed 07/18/24   Page 96 of 172 PageID #: \n55256\ncan meaningfully and substantively determine an inmate’s disciplinary and mental health \nprogress.   \n  In summary, the Court finds that Defendants failed to prove that they remedied the \nlack of individualized treatment plans since the liability phase of trial. However, Plaintiffs \nproved that there are deficiencies with inmate treatment plans that continue to exist and \nwill continue to exist into the future. The treatment plans are devoid of any: 1) true \nindividualization; 2) input from institutional stakeholders; 3) meaningful audit or review \nby a qualified mental health professional; 4) metrics to measure inmate growth, decline, or \nsuccess; and 5) standards, with accompanying staff training, of this standard to ensure that \ntreatment plans are compliant with departmental policy and are consistent across the \ninstitution.  \nb.  Types of Treatment Available to Inmates \nPreviously, the Court held that the only mental health treatment provided to inmates \nwas  the  prescription  of  psychotropic  medication,  which  only  further  proved  the \ndeficiencies in the institution’s provision of mental health care. Record Document 641 at \n89. DWCC did not offer individual therapy. Id. at 90. The Court finds that DWCC still \nrelies upon the prescription of medication as the sole therapeutic service to inmates with \nmental health issues on the South Compound.  \nDefendants contend that they have remedied the limited treatment afforded through \nthe provision of counseling services to inmates in restrictive housing. Towards the end of \n2021,  DWCC  employed  psychologist  Dr.  Julia  Wood  to  provide  clinical  services  to \nindividuals on the North and South Compound. Burgos Remedy Trial Tr. vol IV at 804:12-\n94 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 754   Filed 07/18/24   Page 97 of 172 PageID #: \n55257\n22 [Record Document 707]. Hayden was Dr. Wood’s supervisor;52 despite this, he did not \nknow the dates when she was employed at DWCC. Hayden Remedy Trial Tr. vol. V at \n975:13-976:10, 982:24-25 [Record Document 708]. Dr. Wood left DWCC after only a few \nmonths because “the environment at [DWCC] was not right for her . . . .” Id. at 976:16-19; \nBurgos Remedy Trial Tr. vol IV at 804:12-22 [Record Document 707]. As of August 2022, \nDr. Wood’s position had not been filled. Dauzat Remedy Trial Tr. vol. VI at 1190:11-13 \n[Record Document 709]. Deputy Warden Dauzat testified that DWCC was advertising for \nthe position, as well as for another part-time psychologist position, but had not received \nany applications for those roles. Id. at 1192:10-1193:12.  \nWhen she began her role at DWCC, Dr. Wood requested to use the format that she \ntypically used to take notes in practice. Id. at 1190:1-4. DWCC did not provide her with \nany guidance as to the content or format of her notes. Id. at 1189:23-25. Dauzat did not \nreview  all  of  Dr.  Wood’s  clinician  notes.  Id.  at  1191:18-23.  If  Dr.  Wood  listed \nrecommendations in her notes, it would be up to her to report that information and any \nother relevant findings to the appropriate mental health clinician. Id. at 1193:12-23. If that \nrecommendation involved a referral to Dr. Seal, then the mental health clinician would \nneed to follow up with Dr. Seal. Id. at 1193:23-1194:1.  \nDr. Burns opined that Dr. Wood’s notes provide an example of what a clinician’s \nnotes should look like after a counseling session with an inmate. Burns Remedy Trial Tr. \nvol. VII at 1566:1-10. Dr. Burns found that the notes provided a reason for a referral, \n \n52 Again, the Court notes that Hayden would not have been qualified to supervise Dr. \nWood.  \n95 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 754   Filed 07/18/24   Page 98 of 172 PageID #: \n55258\n“background of the person, what they focused on [in their session], [and] what their \ncondition was. She gave them some homework, and then they came back and followed up \nwith those types of things. That is what you would expect to see in a counseling type note.” \nId.  \nThe Court reviewed Dr. Wood’s clinician notes and agrees that her counseling \nsessions with inmates are a clear-cut example of the types of mental health services that \nshould be offered to inmates in restrictive housing. For example, the Court was provided \nwith psychological service notes summarizing three of Dr. Wood’s meetings with inmate \nD.H. See Ex. PR-U-1 at 1-3 [Record Document 716-137]. At the top of the page, Dr. Wood \nexplains why she met with that inmate. The notes indicate that D.H. was initially referred \nto Dr. Wood “due to repeated need for segregation.” Id. at 3. He subsequently requested \ntwo follow-up appointments. Dr. Wood then explained what the inmate reported, provided \nher  own  narrative  of  the  session  and  her  observations,  and  then  created  a  plan  for \nsubsequent sessions. Id. at 1-3. In inmate D.H.’s case, Dr. Wood provided homework and \ndiscussed her observations as to his physical appearance and emotional state in a detailed, \nmeticulous manner and in such a way that the Court could understand and picture the \ninmate when reading her narrative. This appeared to be consistent throughout her clinician \nnotes. While some sentences were copy and pasted, such as “[i]mpulse control  was \nlimited,” compare id. at 3, with id. at 4, she also incorporated direct quotes from the inmates \nduring their sessions.  \nCertainly, if Dr. Wood had continued working at DWCC, or if DWCC had been \nable to find a similarly qualified mental health professional, then the Court would have \n96 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 754   Filed 07/18/24   Page 99 of 172 PageID #: \n55259\nfound that Defendants had made major strides in remedying the deficiencies in the mental \nhealth services provided to segregated inmates. However, this is not the case. DWCC no \nlonger employs a psychologist for counseling sessions. And, even when Dr. Wood was \nemployed, she still was not employed for enough hours to serve the entire mental health \ncaseload  on  the  South  Compound.  Nonetheless,  Dr.  Wood’s  brief  stint  at  DWCC \ndemonstrates what is not only possible but what is feasible in the area of mental health \nservices.  \nDefendants further argue that they have remedied the limited treatment afforded to \ninmates through the creation of treatment segregation. Treatment segregation is a new type \nof segregation classification implemented at DWCC since the liability phase of trial. \nSherman Remedy Trial Tr. vol. II at 342:17-23 [Record Document 705]. Per DOC policy \nIS-B-4, inmates who are “actively psychotic or who need to be segregated from the general \npopulation for medical purposes may be placed in treatment segregation by the appropriate \nstaff.” Ex. JR-1 at 8 [Record Document 715-1]. This does not include inmates who are \ndisplaying depressive symptoms; rather, only those inmates who are unable to perform \nday-to-day functions can be assigned to treatment segregation. Burgos Remedy Trial Tr. \nvol. IV at 745:17-746:3 [Record Document 707]. An inmate can only be assigned to \ntreatment  segregation  at  the  order  of  a  “physician  or  other  appropriate  healthcare \npractitioner/provider.”  Ex.  JR-1  at  8  [Record  Document  715-1].  The  DOC  does  not \nconsider treatment segregation to be a type of restrictive housing. Id. Inmates may be \nassigned to treatment segregation “only for as long as a medical or mental health risk \ncontinues,” at which point “[t]he physician or appropriate clinical staff shall discontinue \n97 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 754   Filed 07/18/24   Page 100 of 172 PageID #: \n55260\ntreatment segregation.” Id. As understood by DWCC personnel, in treatment segregation, \nthe  inmate  receives  twenty-four-hour  supervision  by  medical  staff  in  the  infirmary. \nSherman Remedy Trial Tr. vol. II at 347:3-11 [Record Document 705]. The main goal of \ntreatment segregation is to ensure that an inmate “gets his proper medications so that \n[DWCC] can get him back to where he needs to be.” Id. at 347:9-11. Mental health staff \nvisit inmates in segregated housing at least once every twenty-four hours. Burgos Remedy \nTrial Tr. vol. IV at 875:11-17 [Record Document 707]. \nAs  of  August  2022,  only  two  individuals  had  been  assigned  to  treatment \nsegregation.  Id.  at  876:13-16.  Inmate  D.O.  was  housed  in  treatment  segregation  for \napproximately three weeks after having lost the ability to perform his daily functions; he \nstopped consuming water and food and would not respond to prison officials. Id. at 876:24-\n877:9. After the three weeks in treatment segregation, D.O. was reassigned to H-4 on the \nNorth Compound. Id. 877:13-21. The second individual, inmate A.E., was transferred from \nN-4 to treatment segregation for about a week after exhibiting signs of active psychosis. \nDauzat Remedy Trial Tr. vol. VI at 1251:16-1252:16 [Record Document 709].  \nDr. Burns called treatment segregation an “oxymoron because a person is still held \nin a cell by themselves, so it is not really treatment. It is still segregation. . . . [And] they’re \nkind of opposite of each other.” Burns Remedy Trial Tr. vol. VII at 1573:19-23 [Record \nDocument 710]. She further observed that: \n[t]hey don’t get out for recreation. They have someone come and stand at the \ncell door. . . . [I]t’s only been used in two instances, as of the end of August. \nAnd in those two instances, it was not clear at all that either of them saw Dr. \nSeal, that he had any involvement in the decision to place them there, that he \nhad any involvement in the decision of when they left, that there was any \n98 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 754   Filed 07/18/24   Page 101 of 172 PageID #: \n55261\nother intervention beyond mental health staff stopping by twice a day to \ncheck on the person. Nursing staff did keep an eye on people. I understand \nthat there [are] big windows to be able to see the person. But that is not really \ntreatment. It’s monitoring. I think it is an improvement if it is where you are \nheld while you are waiting to go to Elayn[] Hunt for actual treatment. \nId. at 1573:19-1574:13.  \nThe Court was convinced by Dr. Burns’s assessment of treatment segregation. First, \nDr. Seal admitted that he had no knowledge or meaningful understanding of treatment \nsegregation: he does not know where treatment segregation is located; he does not know \nthe criteria for placing an inmate on treatment segregation; he has not recommended that \nan inmate be placed on treatment segregation; he has not been asked to opine as to an \nindividual’s placement on treatment segregation; he does not know the services available \nto an inmate in treatment segregation; he does not know how many inmates have been \nplaced in treatment segregation since its implementation; and he only learns of an inmate’s \nprior placement in treatment segregation when and if a mental health clinician informs him \nof that information during an appointment. Seal Remedy Trial Transcript vol. III at 674:6-\n675:4 [Record Document 706].  \nAdditionally,  Hayden  was  unable  to  provide  the  Court  with  any  information \npertaining to treatment segregation, despite the fact that he and those he supervises are able \nto refer someone for placement in treatment segregation. For example, Hayden could not \nremember the only inmate whom he referred for placement; whether inmates in treatment \nsegregation are allowed any out-of-cell or recreational time; where inmates in treatment \nsegregation eat their meals; or the differences in mental health services to be offered to \n99 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 754   Filed 07/18/24   Page 102 of 172 PageID #: \n55262\ninmates on treatment segregation and those offered in regular segregation. Hayden Remedy \nTrial Tr. vol. V at 1098:17-1105:18 [Record Document 708].  \nThe Court finds that  the very fact that neither the prison psychiatrist nor the \nsupervising  mental  health  clinician  could  enunciate  any  specifics  regarding  the \nrequirements and conditions of treatment segregation proves that its purpose is not to \nprovide inmates with mental health treatment, but rather, to medically monitor the inmate \nand to ensure his medication compliance. In this way, treatment segregation is merely an \nextension of DWCC’s policy and focus on medication as the only available treatment for \nan inmate’s mental health treatment.  \nIn summary, the Court finds that DWCC still relies upon prescription medication as \nthe sole treatment for inmates with mental illness on the South Compound. Defendants do \nnot provide meaningful individual or group counseling sessions. Furthermore, treatment \nsegregation  is  merely  a  mechanism  to  ensure  that  an  inmate  in  active  psychosis  is \nmonitored as his medication is administered to him. Defendants failed to meet their burden \nin proving that DWCC has remedied the deficiencies in the mental health treatment \nprovided  to  inmates  on  extended  lockdown.  Plaintiffs  proved  that  these  deficiencies \ncontinue to exist and will continue to exist into the future.  \nc.  Appointments with Dr. Seal \nThe  Court  previously  held  that  the  manner  in  which  Dr.  Seal  conducted  his \nappointments prevented inmates from receiving adequate treatment at DWCC. See Record \nDocument 641 at 91-93. The Court determined that the location of the meetings—the \n100 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 754   Filed 07/18/24   Page 103 of 172 PageID #: \n55263\ncourtroom that is used for disciplinary proceedings—and the lack of privacy represented \nthe antithesis of what proper therapy and treatment require. Id. at 92.  \nAs will be explained in-depth further below, in 2020, Dr. Seal began to offer his \nappointments exclusively through Zoom videoconference. Seal Remedy Trial Tr. vol. III \nat 621:14 [Record Document 706]. Despite this, Dr. Seal’s telehealth appointments are still \nconducted in the courtroom and a member of the mental health department attends the \nappointment.53 See Burgos Remedy Trial Tr. vol. IV at 798:21-799:18 [Record Document \n707]. But, the provision of psychiatric services solely by videoconference has increased \nthe deficiencies in the provision of psychiatric services at DWCC as discussed below. \nDWCC has made no provisions for increasing the confidentiality of the psychiatric visits \nif and when they return to in-person.  \nAdditionally, Dr. Seal’s psychiatric notes continue to be illegible. See Ex. PR-T-3 \n[Record Documents 716-167, 716-168, and 716-169]. Because the mental health staff \ncannot  read  Dr.  Seal’s  notes,  a  mental  health  clinician  still  attends  the  psychiatric \nappointments and creates a second progress note from that meeting. Burgos Remedy Trial \nTr. vol. IV at 799:13-24 [Record Document 707]. Dr. Seal will then scan and send his notes \n \n53 During the liability phase of trial, the Court learned that a security officer is present in \nthe room for the psychiatric appointments. Record Document 641 at 92-93. Defendants \naverred that an inmate could request that the security officer leave; however, there was no \nevidence presented at trial that would indicate that this actually took place. During the \nremedy phase of trial, the Court was not presented with any evidence regarding whether \nthis practice continues. Regardless, because the provision of psychiatric services solely by \nvideo conference is inadequate and because DWCC has not determined what would happen \nif the services were provided in person, the Court finds that DWCC has not remedied the \nlack of confidentiality. \n101 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 754   Filed 07/18/24   Page 104 of 172 PageID #: \n55264\nback to the mental health department. Id. at 799:25-800:2. Dr. Burns opined that Dr. Seal \nshould either type or dictate his appointment notes to ensure that they are accessible to \nmental health and medical staff at DWCC. Burns Remedy Trial Tr. vol. VII at 1571:1-4 \n[Record Document 710]. According to Dr. Burns,  \n[i]t’s  important  that  the  mental  health  staff  be  able  to  read  them.  It’s \nimportant that the mental health staff who might be covering a suicide watch \nor something be able to read what the doctor said about it. The nurses need \nto be able to read it who are covering on the weekends. The physician, the \nmedical director needs to be -- everybody needs to be able to read his notes. \nThat is why it is written down. If it was not important, it would not have to \nbe written down. It is important for continuity of care and to communicate \nacross shifts, days, and people. \nId. at 1571:4-14.  \nAccordingly, the Court finds that Defendants failed to meet their burden in proving \nthat they remedied the deficiencies concerning the appointments with Dr. Seal, which \ninclude the lack of confidentiality during appointments, the lack of legible records from \nappointments, and—as will be discussed in further depth—the overall inadequacies of the \nprovision of psychiatric services which are exacerbated by Dr. Seal’s failure to comply \nwith the terms of his contract and his lack of knowledge pertaining to the conditions of \nconfinement. Plaintiffs proved that these deficiencies continue to exist and will continue to \nexist into the future.  \nd.  Therapeutic Materials \nAs the Court has already mentioned, inmates assigned to investigative, disciplinary, \nand preventative segregation do not attend group classes or programming. During the \nliability  phase  of  trial,  the  Court  found  that  DWCC  failed  to  provide  inmates  with \n102 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 754   Filed 07/18/24   Page 105 of 172 PageID #: \n55265\n“meaningful and helpful therapeutic materials.” Record Document 641 at 93. In fact, the \nonly evidence to support Defendants’ assertion that they provide inmates with therapeutic \nmaterials was a curriculum for an anger management course, which was appropriate for a \ncounselor but not an inmate. Id. Not only did Defendants fail to offer any additional \nevidence that they provide inmates housed on the South Compound with therapeutic \nmaterials, but the one document they did introduce proved to be of negligible value to an \ninmate unless he possessed a certain level of education or had experience working in a \nmental health setting. Id. at 93-94.  \nDuring the remedy phase of trial, Kimball testified that in 2022, inmates housed in \npreventative, disciplinary, and investigative segregation were given correspondence access \nto therapeutic programming by the mental health department.54 Kimball Remedy Trial Tr. \nvol. II at 291:10-20 [Record Document 705]. Those therapeutic correspondence classes are \ncomprised of handouts that are provided to inmates on the North Compound as part of the \nin-person classes that they attend. Robinson Remedy Trial Tr. vol. IX at 2055:4-10 [Record \nDocument 712]. According to Burgos, inmates on the South Compound can be provided \nwith the handouts, which they can complete on their own in their cell and mail back to the \nmental health department for any feedback. Burgos Remedy Trial Tr. vol. III at 707:10-\n710:17 [Record Document 706]; Robinson Remedy Trial Tr. vol. IX at 2053:9-2054:7 \n[Record Document 712].   \n \n54 This is different than the educational correspondence courses offered by external parties, \nwhich have been available for over thirty years to “everybody” willing to pay the requisite \nenrollment fee. Sherman Remedy Trial tr. vol. II at 380:11-21 [Record Document 705]. \n103 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 754   Filed 07/18/24   Page 106 of 172 PageID #: \n55266\nHowever, Dr. Burns did not personally witness an inmate with any such materials \nduring her visit. Burns Remedy Trial Tr. vol. VII at 1568:11-12 [Record Document 710]. \nShe also opined that some inmates would not benefit from correspondence courses because \nthey lacked the focus or skills to individually complete the work. Id. at 1556:11-16. She \nalso noted that there is no evidence that a mental health clinician performs a follow up \nsession  with  the  inmate  to  discuss  the  materials  or  to  discuss  the  results  of  their \nassignments.  Id.  at  1568:2-10.  Furthermore,  an  inmate’s  completion  of  these \ncorrespondence courses is not noted in his individual treatment plan. Id.  \nThe  Court  finds  that  Defendants  failed  to  prove  that  they  have  remedied  the \npreviously enunciated deficiencies with regard to the provision of therapeutic materials. \nDefendants have been able to prove that there are a variety of correspondence classes of \nwhich inmates are able to take advantage. This is certainly an improvement. However, \nthese correspondence classes are still inaccessible to much of the segregated housing \npopulation and require a trained professional to either counsel or teach them the materials \npresented  therein.  See  Exs.  JR-28-JR-60  [Record  Documents  715-23-54].  These \ncorrespondence  courses  would  be  difficult  for  any  layperson  to  understand  without \nprofessional guidance. Without proper follow-up or guidance, inmates who complete these \ncorrespondence courses are not able to independently digest the key takeaways or derive \nany benefit. In summary, Defendants have failed to prove that they have remedied this \ndeficiency since the liability phase of trial. Plaintiffs proved that these deficiencies continue \nto exist and will continue to exist into the future. \n \n104 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 754   Filed 07/18/24   Page 107 of 172 PageID #: \n55267\n3.  Staffing of the Mental Health Department \nDuring the liability phase of trial, the Court found that inadequate staffing at DWCC \ncontributed to the facility’s inability to provide adequate mental health care to inmates. \nRecord Document 641 at 94. The inadequate staffing included the lack of access to the \nprison psychiatrist and the lack of mental health clinicians. Id.  \nAs to access to Dr. Seal, during the liability phase of trial, the Court learned that \nDWCC contracted with Dr. Seal to provide eighteen hours of psychiatric services per \nmonth, time which included his travel from Shreveport to Homer. Id. The Court found this \namount of time to be below the standard of constitutional care and insufficient considering \nthe number of inmates requiring psychiatric intervention at DWCC. Id. at 95. Likewise, \nbased on Dr. Burns’s testimony, the Court found that the amount of time that Dr. Seal spent \nwith each patient (three to five minutes for a check-up and ten minutes for new patients) \nwas inadequate. Id.  \nDuring the remedy phase of trial, the Court learned that there was no improvement \nin the amount of time spent by Dr. Seal with inmates, despite a change in his contract to \nattempt to increase the provision of psychiatric services. Additionally, the Court finds that \nDefendants and Dr. Seal misrepresented the amount of time Dr. Seal spent in service to the \ninmates. As the Court has already explained, Dr. Seal began to provide telepsychiatry in \n2020. Seal Remedy Trial Tr. vol. III at 618:13-621:14 [Record Document 706]. Dr. Seal \ntestified that from March 2020 through early 2021, he conducted those Zoom appointments \ntwo Thursdays per month for the entire facility. The evidence submitted by Plaintiffs—a \ncompilation of all dates on which Dr. Seal had a documented psychiatric appointment at \n105 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 754   Filed 07/18/24   Page 108 of 172 PageID #: \n55268\nDWCC—showed that in 2020, Dr. Seal worked a single, four-hour shift at DWCC in \nJanuary, three shifts in June, and two shifts each month during the remaining ten months. \nSee PR-T-2 at 1 [Record Document 716-136]. \nIn early 2021, DWCC expanded the terms of its contract with Dr. Seal to include \ntwo, four-hour shifts via Zoom video conference per week. Seal Remedy Trial Tr. vol. III \nat 621:14 [Record Document 706]. Under the extended contract hours, Dr. Seal would host \nhis psychiatric clinic for inmates on the North Compound on Wednesday and on the South \nCompound on Thursdays. Id. at 623:1-7. Dr. Seal reported that on Thursdays, he typically \nmet with six to twenty inmates during his four-hour shift. Id. at 623:24-624:2. Thus, \naccording to the contract and Dr. Seal’s own testimony, he would conduct eight to nine \nfour-hour sessions per month beginning in 2021. While the contract and his testimony \nmight suggest an increase in the time available for psychiatric services to inmates, the \nevidence at trial showed that Dr. Seal did not fulfill the contract terms and that the time he \nactually spent with inmates was much less than his contract required. In fact, in 2021, Dr. \nSeal worked the following number of shifts for the months listed: January (2); February \n(2); March (3); April (2); May (2); June (2); July (3); August (3); September (5); October \n(7); November (2); and December (4). Id. at 2. In 2022, Dr. Seal worked the following \nnumber of shifts for the months listed: January (3); February (3); March (2); April (6); May \n(6); June (9). Id. at 3. In enumerating Dr. Seal’s shifts at DWCC since the liability phase \nof trial, the Court aims to demonstrate that Dr. Seal’s contractual duties are rarely fulfilled. \nThe infrequency of his visits  results in  a lack of mental health  services  to inmates, \nespecially  when  the  provision  of  psychotropic  medication  continues  to  be  the  sole \n106 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 754   Filed 07/18/24   Page 109 of 172 PageID #: \n55269\ntreatment provided to inmates at DWCC. These facts also point out not only Dr. Seal’s \ndeliberate indifference to his duties but a disturbing lack of administrative oversight over \nthe sole provision of treatment available to inmates on the South Compound.  \nA further deficiency in the provision of psychiatric services is that all visits with Dr. \nSeal are by video conference. The Court understands that this practice might have been \nnecessary  as  an  emergency  measure  in  2020  and  early  2021  due  to  the  COVID-19 \npandemic, but the practice continued as of August 30, 2022. There was no testimony from \nanyone at DWCC that there were any plans to change this practice. Dr. Burns enunciated \nher concerns about Dr. Seal’s conducting all psychiatric appointments via Zoom. During \nthe liability phase of trial, when Dr. Seal was conducting his visits in person at the facility, \nthe Court learned that Dr. Seal did not know anything about the conditions of strip cell \nstatus, standard suicide watch, or extreme suicide watch. Record Document 641 at 96. \nReferencing his lack of understanding and knowledge, Dr. Burns opined that the Zoom \nnature of Dr. Seal’s psychiatric visits further limited Dr. Seal’s ability to understand the \nconditions of confinement that may be impacting the inmate. Burns Remedy Trial Tr. vol. \nVII at 1568:22-1569:8 [Record Document 710]. Specifically, Dr. Burns testified that it is \nhelpful for the practitioner to know about his client’s environment because it helps to \n“solidify [his] thinking about the environment and the conditions and . . . where the person \nlived [and] . . . what it was like for them.” Id. at 1569:16-18. Without understanding the \nconditions of confinement that his inmates experience, Dr. Seal is unable to fully grasp the \nimpacts to and cause of inmates’ mental health status in restricted housing.  \n107 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 754   Filed 07/18/24   Page 110 of 172 PageID #: \n55270\nWhile  the  spread  of  the  COVID-19  virus  during  2020  and  2021  may  have \nnecessitated the use of Zoom for these psychiatric visits, the Defendants offered no reason \nwhy in-person visits have not resumed. The Court is persuaded by Dr. Burns’s testimony \nthat the continuation of Zoom visits exacerbates Dr. Seal’s lack of understanding of the \nconditions of confinement that directly affect the mental health of his patients.  \nIn its liability phase opinion, the Court determined that the mental health department \nat DWCC was inadequately staffed. Record Document 641 at 97. At the time, Hayden and \nBurgos were the primary mental health practitioners responsible for delivering mental \nhealth services to inmates on the South Compound. Id. at 98. The Court deemed the staffing \nat DWCC to be inadequate because of Hayden’s lack of qualifications; the approximate \nsize of the South Compound’s mental health case load; and the substantial number of \nresponsibilities on the North Compound that each man had concurrent with his South \nCompound responsibilities. Id.  \nDuring the remedy phase of trial, the Court learned that DWCC hired two new social \nworkers, Julia Spivey and Lisa Wells, to provide care to inmates housed on the North \nCompound. Ex. JR-60 at ¶ 38 [Record Document 715-54]. This allows Burgos and Hayden \nto “focus on the South Compound.” Id. Robinson primarily supports the North Compound, \nid., although she testified that will assist Burgos and Hayden with their South Compound \nresponsibilities as needed, Robinson Remedy Trial Tr. vol. IX at 2028:13-16 [Record \nDocument  728].  It  is  worth  noting,  however,  that  Burgos  and  Hayden  do  not  work \nweekends, resulting in an inmate having to wait through the weekend to speak with a \nmental health practitioner should he experience mental health problems.  \n108 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 754   Filed 07/18/24   Page 111 of 172 PageID #: \n55271\nDWCC appears to acknowledge that it is severely understaffed. From August to \nDecember 2021, as mentioned above, DWCC employed a psychologist named Dr. Julia \nWood. Dauzat Remedy Trial Tr. vol. VI at 1190:5-7 [Record Document 709]. Dr. Wood \nprimarily  worked  with  inmates  housed  on  the  South  Compound.  Id.  at  1189:17-19. \nHowever, Dr. Wood left DWCC because she did not find it to be a comfortable working \nenvironment. Id. at 1190:8-10. DWCC has been unable to fill her position in the year since \nshe left. Id. at 1190:11-13. According to Deputy Warden Dauzat, as of August 2022, \nDWCC was seeking to hire two new psychologists. Id. at 1192:10-1193:11. One would be \na full-time, contract psychologist, while the other would be a part-time civil service \npsychologist whose time would be split with another DOC program. Id. However, these \ntwo positions are still vacant and therefore the South Compound inmates are still suffering \nfrom  inadequate  staffing.  Thus,  considering  Hayden’s  lack  of  qualifications  and  the \ninability of DWCC to hire extra staff, the Court finds that DWCC has been unable remedy \nthis inadequate staffing.  \nConsidering the evidence presented by the parties at trial, the Court finds that \nDefendants failed to remedy the inadequate staffing at DWCC, with respect to both the \npsychiatric services as well as the mental health department. This inadequate staffing \nfurther demonstrates the systemic deficiencies in the mental health program available to \ninmates  housed  on  the  South  Compound.  Plaintiffs  were  able  to  prove  that  these \ndeficiencies in staffing continue to exist and will continue to exist into the future.  \n \n \n109 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 754   Filed 07/18/24   Page 112 of 172 PageID #: \n55272\n4.  Administration of Psychotropic Medication \nDuring the liability phase of trial, the Court found that there were widespread \nsystemic deficiencies with respect to the administration of psychotropic medication that \nrose to the level of a constitutional violation, including: the lack of adequate training \nprovided to Pill Call Officers; the failure to provide Pill Call Officers with adequate written \nguidance or other written materials; the absence of reporting systems; the lack of follow-\nup for medication non-compliance; the failure to audit or provide quality assurance of the \nPill Call Officers’ job performance; and the failure to provide the prison psychiatrist, Dr. \nSeal, with access to the Electronic Medication Administration Records (“E-MAR”) system. \nRecord Document 641 at 98. The Court will address each issue in turn.   \nPreviously, DWCC employed Sgt. Paul Pitts (“Pitts”) as the Pill Call Officer for the \nSouth Compound. Record Document 641 at 99. Prior to beginning the role, Pitts received \none to two days of training from a DWCC nurse on the “Pill Pass Policy,” which was a \nbrief PowerPoint Presentation that detailed the procedures for administering medication \nand the reasons why those procedures were important. Id. Since the liability phase of trial, \nPitts was replaced with Austin Burns and Rimmer, both of whom serve as Pill Call Officers \non the South Compound. Ex. JR-60 at ¶ 58 [Record Document 669]. Austin Burns’s \ntestimony highlighted a similar training experience to that outlined by Pitts. Specifically, \nBurns testified that he received hands-on training by the medical staff on the intricacies of \nmedication administration, including the time that medication is dispensed, procedures for \ndispensing the medications, and which medications an offender was prescribed. Ex. PR-\nBB-2 at 9:5-20 [Record Document 714-2]. Rimmer, however, testified that his hands-on \n110 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 754   Filed 07/18/24   Page 113 of 172 PageID #: \n55273\ntraining was conducted by “the previous [P]ill [C]all [O]fficer, Matt Wiese,” and the \ntraining on the E-MAR was conducted by Austin Burns—notably, not medical staff. Ex. \nPR-BB-3 at 9:9-10:1 [Record Document 714-3]. Both men testified that they receive \nannual training every February by medical staff and that the PowerPoint displayed during \nthat training is provided to them for reference. See id. at 9:16-23; see also Ex. PR-BB-2 at \n9:5-20 [Record Document 714-2]. This annual training was in effect during the liability \nphase of trial. As will become apparent in this section, the Court finds that DWCC has \nfailed  to  remedy  the  previously  enunciated  deficiencies  in  its  administration  of \npsychotropic medication.  \nAs the Court previously mentioned, Austin Burns has a criminal justice background. \nDefendants did not introduce any evidence to suggest that he has any medical training or \neducation. Yet, DWCC tasked Austin Burns—who had only assumed the Pill Call Officer \nrole a few months prior to Rimmer—with providing Rimmer the requisite “hands-on” \ntraining relating to sensitive topics such as proper procedures for medication administration \nand the effects of medication non-compliance. Austin Burns was not qualified to provide \nRimmer with that training and could not properly advise Rimmer of what medical side \neffects or symptoms might warrant intervention by the medical staff, especially considering \nhis tenure in the position at the time. Only a medical professional would have been qualified \nto provide that training.  \nDr. Burns recommended that medication administration be completed by nursing \nstaff, as is the common practice in general population. Burns Remedy Trial Tr. vol. VII at \n1565:3-6 [Record Document 710]. Defendants had no explanation for why less qualified \n111 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 754   Filed 07/18/24   Page 114 of 172 PageID #: \n55274\nindividuals  were  tasked  with  medication  administration  on  the  South  Compound,  a \npopulation with a greater overall percentage of inmates who are diagnosed with mental \nhealth issues and more complicated medication administration issues.  \nAustin Burns and Rimmer also testified regarding the processes for administering \nmedication on the South Compound, which are the same as those outlined by Pitts during \nthe liability phase of trial with a few significant exceptions. Compare Ex. PR-BB-3 at \n11:16-14:3 [Record Document 714-3], and Ex. PR-BB-2 at 13:4-14:23 [Record Document \n714-2], with Record Document 641 at 99-100. First, Austin Burns and Rimmer conduct \ntheir morning, lunch time, and evening rounds at 6:00 a.m., 12:00 p.m., and 2:00 p.m., \nrespectively, despite the policy dictating that the evening round should be conducted at \n4:00 p.m. Id. at 20:22-21:1; Ex. PR-BB-2 at 19:2-21 [Record Document 714-2]. The Pill \nCall Officers testified that they have been administering the evening medication at 2:00 \np.m. since they assumed their duties. Id. at 19:19-21 [Record Document 714-2]; Ex. PR-\nBB-3 at 21:2-3 [Record Document 714-3].   \nDr. Burns testified this is a direct violation of DWCC policy.55 Burns Remedy Trial \nTr.  vol.  VII  at  1559:15-17  [Record  Document  710].  Dr.  Burns  further  opined  that \nadministering an evening medication at 2:00 p.m. negatively impacts an inmate. Id. at \n1559:24. First, taking the medication at 2:00 p.m. will result in the inmate being unable to \nexperience  the  effects  of  that  medication  later  in  the  evening.  Id.  at  1559:19-24. \nAdditionally, the early administration of medication means that inmates who are prescribed \n \n55 The parties did not offer this policy into evidence for the Court to review independently.  \n112 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 754   Filed 07/18/24   Page 115 of 172 PageID #: \n55275\npsychotropic medications that require blood monitoring—like lithium—will not have an \naccurate reading because their blood is not drawn at the correct time. Id. at 1560:6-21. As \nDr. Burns explained,  \n[There  are]  ramifications,  as  we  talked  about  before,  where  things  like \nlithium, the level is supposed to be drawn 12 hours after the last dose. If they \nget their evening dose at 2 p.m., that means their blood level should be drawn \nat 2 a.m, in the morning. But it is not. It’s drawn later. And it might even be \ndrawn after 5:00 when they have their morning dose. So the level is going to \nlook either really low, because it is now 15 hours or 16 hours after the last \ndose, or elevated because they got another dose in the meantime before the \nlevel was drawn. And most medicines are measured at their -- or their low \nlevel. And so it has ramifications, not only for the impact on the person for \nwhom  you  are  prescribing  something  to  help  them  sleep,  but  also  in \nmanaging blood levels and interpreting them correctly, and then adjusting \nmedicine based on that interpretation. \nId. The Court is persuaded by Dr. Burns’s opinion regarding the potential harms that are \nposed by administering the evening medication at 2:00 p.m. and finds that the practice \ndisplays further evidence of the deliberate indifference that DWCC displays towards this \nrisk of harm.  \n  During the liability phase of trial, the Court heard testimony regarding the process \nthat the Pill Call Officer took to record medication non-compliance. Prior to March 2020, \nthe Pill Call Officer would record an inmate’s consumption of medication in the E-MAR \nsystem after each round. Record Document 641 at 100. If an inmate refused the medication, \nthe Pill Call Officer would input an “R” in the E-MAR system; if the medication was not \nrequested, he would input an “N” in the system. Id. However, after reviewing a group of \nE-MAR sheets, the Court found there to be widespread inaccuracies in the records kept by \nthe Pill Call Officers  and no follow-up by medical or  mental health staff regarding \n113 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 754   Filed 07/18/24   Page 116 of 172 PageID #: \n55276\nmedication non-compliance. Id. at 103-104. For example, as is discussed in more detail \nbelow, Dr. Seal did not have access to the E-MAR and did not know whether a printed \ncopy of the E-MAR (known as a “MAR”) was in each relevant inmate’s chart. Instead, he \nhad access to older records printed off at the end of each prior month. He also testified that \nhe did not know what the “N” and “R” in the MARs indicated. Id. at 104. In a situation \nwhere medication administration is the only treatment being afforded to inmates with \nmental illness, it is startling that such inadequacies existed around its administration.  \nDuring the remedy phase of trial, the Court learned that the Pill Call Officers \ncontinue  to  use  that  same  process  to  indicate  whether  an  inmate  has  refused  his \nmedication.56 Ex. PR-BB-2 at 24:5-28:1 [Record Document 714-2]; Ex. PR-BB-3 at 27:4-\n29 :7 [Record Document 714-3]. Dr. Burns testified that DWCC “reported that they were \nmore closely monitoring” medication non-compliance. Burns Remedy Trial Tr. vol. VII at \n1564:16-19 [Record Document 710]. But it was not clear from the testimony exactly what \nthat meant. Deputy Warden Dauzat testified that she reviews the E-MAR for medication \ncompliance at irregular intervals; however, those reviews have never triggered any follow-\nup or changes to DWCC policy. Dauzat Remedy Trial Tr. vol. VI at 1264:1-12 [Record \n \n56 During the remedy phase of trial, the Court heard testimony about a new medication \nadministration system that DWCC was attempting to implement, known as the sMARt \nsystem.  Burgos  Remedy  Trial  Tr.  vol.  IV  at  815:24-817:7  [Record  Document  707]. \nHowever, even as of January 2023, the system was not operational because of system \nfailures and inaccuracies. Id. Dr. Burns opined that, so long as DWCC could ensure that its \ndata was reliable, the sMARt system would be a positive change because it allows for the \ncontemporaneous administration and documentation of medication. Burns Remedy Trial \nTr. vol. VII at 1563:4-1564:2 [Record Document 710]. She argued that this automated \ndocumentation could ensure a more efficient and accurate way of administering and \nrecording medication administration and non-compliance. Id.  \n114 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 754   Filed 07/18/24   Page 117 of 172 PageID #: \n55277\nDocument 709]. The parties did not offer any MARs into evidence for the Court to \nindependently review. Considering this information, the Court finds that the medication \nadministration is being handled by improperly trained and credentialed individuals, is \nbeing administered at improper times, and is not properly reviewed by the administration \nor by medical staff for medication non-compliance. As it highlighted in its liability phase \nopinion, the Court found that these inadequacies put inmates at risk of further mental health \ndecompensation. Record Document 641 at 104.   \nDuring the liability phase of trial, as noted above, Dr. Seal testified that he did not \nhave access to the E-MAR and did not know whether a physical copy of the MAR was in \nan inmate’s chart. Id. He also did not understand what the “N” and “R” designations on the \nMAR printouts indicated. Id. During the remedy phase of trial, the Court learned that Dr. \nSeal still does not have access to the E-MAR and is not provided a physical copy of an \ninmate’s MAR for his appointments. Robinson Remedy Trial Tr. vol. IX at 2038:11-15 \n[Record Document 712]. Instead, Robinson testified that Dr. Seal must rely upon a staff \nmember to tell him that an inmate has not been taking his medication. Id. at 2038:15-18. \nRobinson explained that it was her own practice to speak with an inmate before his \npsychiatric appointment regarding his medication non-compliance, but no evidence was \npresented to confirm that these conversations actually take place. Id. at 2038:22-2039:3. \nNeither Burgos nor Hayden testified that they follow these same procedures. Nor was the \nCourt presented with any testimony that Robinson or Hayden reviewed the E-MAR prior \nto appointments with Dr. Seal. Burgos testified only that he reviewed the E-MAR more \n115 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 754   Filed 07/18/24   Page 118 of 172 PageID #: \n55278\nfrequently for medication compliance than he had previously. Burgos Remedy Trial Tr. \nvol. IV at 817:8-25 [Record Document 707].    \nThe Court finds that officials at DWCC have not remedied the deficiencies in the \nadministration of psychotropic medication, including: the lack of adequate guidance and \ntraining; the absence of reporting systems; the unqualified Pill Call Officers tasked with \nadministering the inmates’ medication; the lack of processes or procedures to review a Pill \nCall  Officer’s  documentation  of  medication  non-compliance;  the  inadequate \nadministration of medications including administration at the wrong times; and the lack of \nfollow-up for medication non-compliance including the fact that Dr. Seal is not notified of \nand his inability to review an inmate’s medication non-compliance. Again, in a system \nwhere  the only treatment for mental illness is medication, such deficiencies  show a \ndeliberate indifference as to the health and safety of inmates with mental illness. Plaintiffs \nproved that these systemic deficiencies persist and will continue to persist into the future.   \n5.  Lack of Accurate and Adequate Records \nDuring the liability phase of trial, the Court found there to be deficiencies in \nDWCC’s record keeping practices and procedures. In addition to the issues with record \nkeeping that have already been addressed—including duplicate records, the lack of detail \nand attention in maintaining medical and mental health records, inconsistencies between \nreporting procedures and records, and illegible writing—the Court held that Dr. Seal did \nnot maintain the requisite quality and quantity of record keeping that his role requires to \nprotect and treat inmates. Record Document 641 at 105-06. Additionally, the medical \nrecords were devoid of any indication that inmates sign consent forms or receive any \n116 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 754   Filed 07/18/24   Page 119 of 172 PageID #: \n55279\ndocumentation outlining the risks and benefits of the medications that Dr. Seal prescribes. \nId. at 106. During the remedy phase of trial, Defendants did not provide any evidence to \nprove that these deficiencies have been remedied.  \nIn its liability phase opinion, the Court held that that the inmates’ records lack any \ndocumentation that would show that Dr. Seal actively participated in treatment team \nmeetings or intervention development, which Dr. Burns claimed was a responsibility of a \nprison psychologist. Id. During the remedy phase of trial, the Court learned that this had \nnot been remedied. First, there is no prison psychologist. In such absence, not only did Dr. \nSeal not participate in the creation of an inmate’s treatment plan, but he also was not \ninvolved in the development of the treatment plan form, nor did he review an inmate’s \ntreatment plan prior to a clinical visit. Seal Remedy Trial Tr. vol III at 669:3-20 [Record \nDocument 706]. However, his diagnoses are used by the mental health clinicians when \ncreating the plan. Id. at 669:19-20. In sum, Dr. Seal’s records do not show that he plays \nany active role in an inmate’s treatment plan, other than to indicate whether an inmate has \nbeen diagnosed with a mental illness.   \n6.  Suicide Prevention Program \nCourts have held that prisons must have adequate suicide prevention policies to \nprovide constitutional care. Ruiz, 503 F. Supp. at 1339; Braggs v. Dunn, 257 F. Supp. 3d \n1171,  1219  (M.D.  Ala.  2017);  Madrid,  889  F.  Supp.  at  1258.  “[T]he  identification, \ntreatment, and supervision of inmates with suicidal tendencies is a necessary component \nof any mental health treatment program.” Ruiz, 503 F. Supp. at 1339. During the liability \nphase, the Court found that the suicide prevention program at DWCC failed to provide \n117 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 754   Filed 07/18/24   Page 120 of 172 PageID #: \n55280\ninmates with the requisite level of care, especially because the policies resulted in a failure \nto identify, treat, and supervise inmates with suicidal tendencies. Record Document 641 at \n107. As will be elaborated upon further, the Court finds that Defendants have failed to \nremedy  the  constitutionally  inadequate  policies  and  processes  governing  the  suicide \nprevention program at DWCC.  \na.  Punitive Nature of the Suicide Prevention Program \nAs the Court discussed in depth in its liability phase opinion, an inmate may be \nassigned to two different types of suicide watch: standard and extreme. Id. Specifically, the \nCourt learned that “standard suicide watch is for the management of offenders who are at \nrisk for suicide but do not present a clear and continual risk of self-injurious behavior(s),” \nwhereas extreme suicide watch is for “the management of offenders who present a clear \nand continual risk of self-injurious behavior.” Id. (quotation marks and citations omitted). \nThose definitions have not changed since the liability phase of trial.  \nIn that opinion, the Court found that the conditions of standard suicide watch mirror \nthe conditions of strip cell status because inmates were deprived of all personal property—\nincluding clothing and mattresses—and were only permitted to wear paper gowns. Id. at \n108. DWCC also informally placed some inmates on “manipulative suicide watch,” which \noccurred when an inmate displayed self-injurious behavior because he was “looking for a \ncell move” or was aggravated with the staff. Id. According to Hayden, an inmate placed on \nmanipulative suicide watch was stripped of his property, while those who were deemed \nlegitimately suicidal were allowed to keep a few possessions. Id. This demonstrated to the \n118 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 754   Filed 07/18/24   Page 121 of 172 PageID #: \n55281\nCourt that inmates were not stripped of their personal belongings to ensure their security \nor the security of the facility but rather to impose a punitive sanction on the individual. Id.  \n  During the remedy phase of trial, the Court learned that a new policy governing the \nsuicide prevention program at DWCC went into effect on March 21, 2022. See Record \nDocument JR-14 at 1 [Record Document 715-14]. The policy itself does not represent any \nchange to the actual conditions of standard suicide watch, despite instructing DWCC’s staff \nto use the least restrictive measures necessary to ensure that the inmate does not harm \nhimself. Id. at 8. Nor did testimony from DWCC officials indicate that the conditions of \nstandard suicide watch have been remedied. See ex. Hayden Remedy Trial Tr. vol. V at \n1035:21-24  [Record  Document  708].  Hayden  testified  that  it  must  be  specifically \ndocumented in a management order that an inmate on suicide watch may receive a suicide \nmattress or remain with any of his property. Id. at 1033:10-16. Hayden further represented \nto the Court that it was his general practice to ensure that inmates on suicide watch were \nprovided with mattresses. Id. at 1033:17-19. However, the Court reviewed only a single \nmanagement order wherein Hayden explicitly permitted an inmate on suicide watch to \npossess any belongings or a mattress. See Ex. PR-B-4 at 182 [Record Document 716-154 \nat 8]. In summary, DWCC has failed to remedy this deficiency in its suicide prevention \nprogram.  \n  The Court also finds that Plaintiffs were able to carry their burden in proving that \nsuicide watch continues to be used to punish inmates. The strongest example of this was \n119 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 754   Filed 07/18/24   Page 122 of 172 PageID #: \n55282\nexhibited in an interaction between security staff and inmate J.B.57 According to an UOR, \nfiled in conjunction with this incident, J.B. was pepper sprayed and placed in leg shackles \nby security staff for refusing to drop to his knees at his cell front and for subsequently \nbiting a security officer. Ex. PR-C at 4 [Record Document 716-40]. After being escorted \nto the courtroom to speak with Assistant Warden Mays, Coleman, Hayden, and a member \nof the nursing staff, J.B. was placed on standard suicide watch. Id. After removal from \nstandard suicide watch, Hayden ordered that the inmate be placed on strip cell status. Id. \nNone of the UORs relating to this incident provide a reason why J.B. was placed on \nstandard suicide watch and then strip cell status. See generally id. Certainly, the narrative \ndoes not demonstrate that J.B. made any concerning statements or engaged in self-injurious \nbehavior during his meeting with staff, as it is reported several times that J.B. refused to \nspeak. Id. at 4, 13.  \nConsidering this, the Court finds Hayden’s assignment of J.B. to standard suicide \nwatch was punitive—and not preventative—in nature. First, there was no indication that \nJ.B. had threatened to commit suicide; additionally, there is no record that J.B. was \nengaging in self-injurious behavior. Certainly, the narrative of events indicates that J.B. \nwas not following the directives given by security staff. However, mere non-compliance—\nthough perhaps a security concern—does not mean that J.B. was suicidal. This finding is \nsupported by the fact that J.B. was assigned to strip cell status immediately thereafter.  \n \n57 Out of respect for the sensitive nature of this discussion and the information it reveals \ntherein, the inmate’s name will not be disclosed. This J.B. is different from the inmate \npreviously discussed. See infra p. 135. \n120 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 754   Filed 07/18/24   Page 123 of 172 PageID #: \n55283\nIn another example discussed during the remedy phase of trial, on March 22, 2021, \ninmate  T.D.  submitted  a  complaint  through  the  Administrative  Remedy  Procedure \n(“ARP”) reporting that he was pepper sprayed while placed on extreme suicide watch in a \nblack  box  with  handcuffs,  waist  chains,  and  shackles  for  engaging  in  self-injurious \nbehavior. Ex. PR-M-1 at 1 [Record Document 716-125-1]. In the ARP, the inmate recounts \nthe following narrative: \nI was on suicide watch (extreme watch) placed in full alternative restraints . . \n. due to self-mutilation apx. 2 hours before [the] [] incident . . . I notified them \nthat I wasn’t in my right state of mind, due to not consistently taking my \nmental health medication and that I wanted to see the social worker. He told \nme that I wasn’t seeing anybody and deployed chemical agent while I was \nfully restrained and in a suicide gown in the cell. I then continued to notify \nthem that I wanted to see somebody. Chemical agent was deployed a second \ntime. . . . I was forced to sit in the cell fully restrained, with the same suicide \ngown on full of mace, never given a shower or mattress either, until apx. 12 \nhours later when the next shift came on. \nId.  \nDanny Henshaw’s UOR relating to the incident confirms, in part, T.D.’s narrative \nof events. According to Henshaw’s UOR, Henshaw was dispatched to an incident in N-1, \nwhere  it  was  reported  that  T.D.,  who  was  on  extreme  suicide  watch  in  “alternative \nrestraints,” was “banging his head on the wall and on the top bunk.” Id. at 9. Because he \nwas banging his head, a chemical agent was deployed. Id. A second burst of chemical agent \nwas deployed after T.D. continued to scream and failed to comply with the officer’s orders. \nId. Henshaw claims that T.D. was escorted to the lobby to visit with a nurse, where he was \noffered, but refused, an eye wash, given a clean paper gown, and placed back in his \ncleansed cell in restraints. Id. This incident highlights the punitive nature of suicide watch \n121 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 754   Filed 07/18/24   Page 124 of 172 PageID #: \n55284\nat DWCC. Certainly, pepper spraying an inmate for exhibiting self-injurious behavior—\none who is already in restraints for cutting himself—is not going to remedy the situation \nor improve his mental health, and clearly, this is not an instance where security staff utilized \nthe least amount of force necessary for terminating the behavior. \n  During the liability phase of trial, the Court learned that inmates assigned to extreme \nsuicide watch were subjected to the same conditions as standard suicide watch, with the \nexception that those on extreme suicide watch could be placed in restraints. Those restraints \nincluded: \n(1) four-point restraints, which consist of both hands being cuffed with the \nchain for the cuffs connected to a box at the mid-section, designed to prevent \nmovement or tampering, a belly chain connected to the handcuff chain, and \nshackles on the ankles; (2) placing a prisoner in a restraint chair, which \nattaches each limb to the chair; or (3) the placing of the prisoner in a restraint \nchair, as above, with a helmet to prevent spitting and head banging. \nRecord Document 641 at 109 (citation omitted).  \nConsidering the compelling testimony by both parties’ experts, the Court found that \nthe policies and practices surrounding the use of restraints on inmates housed on extreme \nsuicide watch rose to the level of an Eighth Amendment violation. Id. at 111. First, the \nCourt found that the use of the restraint chair for indefinite periods of time and without \nconstant supervision was a deviation from DWCC’s own policies, was a practice that fell \nwell below the minimum standard of mental health care, and put inmates at risk of serious \nmedical complications, including death. Id. at 110-111.  \nDespite Hayden’s testimony to the contrary, see Hayden Remedy Trial Tr. vol. V at \n1014:5-1021:23, Plaintiffs presented evidence during the remedy phase of trial that DWCC \n122 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 754   Filed 07/18/24   Page 125 of 172 PageID #: \n55285\ncontinues to utilize the restraint chair, see Ex. PR-B-33 at 313 [Record Document 716-37]; \nPR-C-1 at 719 [Record Document 716-43]. The Court reviewed a UOR detailing another \nexample entered into evidence of cruel and unusual punishment in the suicide prevention \nprogram. On August 21, 2021, inmate N.B. was placed on extreme suicide watch by \nHayden and a physician. Ex. PR-C-1 at 719 [Record Document 716-43]. According to the \nUOR, inmate N.B. was in the restraint chair in the lobby being seen by a nurse for a self-\ninflicted cut to his inner thigh. Id. As a reminder, inmates in the restraint chair are shackled \nat their wrists and feet. The officer claims that N.B. became “combative and violent” as the \nnurse attempted to treat the wound. Id. The officer claims that N.B. was given “several \ndirect verbal orders” to discontinue his actions, which N.B. disregarded. Id. As a result, \nN.B. was pepper sprayed, while restrained in the chair. Id. The narrative then describes that \nN.B. was unstrapped from the restraint chair and restrained for a shower, at which time it \nwas discovered that he had a razor blade in his mouth. Id.   \nSince the liability phase of trial, DWCC purchased a restraint bed to be used for \ninmates on extreme suicide watch. Coleman Remedy Trial Tr. vol. I at 100:12-15 [Record \nDocument 704]. Though procured in early September of 2021, the bed did not become \noperational until October of that year. Dauzat Remedy Trial Tr. vol. VI at 1204:6-20 \n[Record Document 709]. DWCC utilizes leather restraints to secure an inmate to the bed. \nColeman Remedy Trial Tr. vol. I at 101:1-4 [Record Document 704]. When utilized, the \nrestraint bed is placed in the inmate’s cell. Burgos Remedy Trial Tr. vol. IV at 750:14-19 \n[Record Document 707]. Nail provided staff with training on the proper use of the restraint \nbed. Dauzat Remedy Trial Tr. vol. VI at 1211:1-3 [Record Document 709]. \n123 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 754   Filed 07/18/24   Page 126 of 172 PageID #: \n55286\nBody camera footage dated December 11, 2021, shows the restraint bed in use with \ninmate N.B. See Ex. PR-D-46 [Record Document 48]. The video, which is one minute and \nten seconds in length, shows N.B. laying on the restraint bed in his cell. Id. The bed is \nplaced in a slightly diagonal position, with N.B.’s head towards the entrance of his cell and \nhis feet down by the toilet and sink. Id. The diagonal positioning suggests that the restraint \nbed is too long to fit into the cell. Despite being called a restraint bed, there appears to be \nno mattress on the fixture, which has a solid, plastic-type appearance. Id. N.B. is restrained \nat his ankles and wrists with the leather restraints. Id. In the video, a nurse converses with \nN.B. and checks what appears to be a leg wound. Id. N.B. appears to struggle against the \nrestraints a bit but is only able to lift his head into a half-crunch position and only slightly \nbend his knees. Id.  \nDr. Burns opined that the restraint bed is an improvement over the metal restraints \npreviously used but stated that the restraint bed’s appropriate use is “in a health care \nsetting.”  Burns  Remedy  Trial  Tr.  vol.  VIII  at  1679:13-21  [Record  Document  722]. \nHowever, as the Court’s summary of the video demonstrates, the bed is not utilized in a \nhealthcare setting but in the inmate’s own cell. In fact, in all six instances where the \nrestraint bed had been used, the inmate was left in his cell. Dauzat Remedy Trial Tr. vol. \nXI at 2396:1-10 [Record Document 717]. As Plaintiffs’ experts testified during the liability \nphase of trial, an inmate should only be placed in full restraints in a health care setting \nbecause he requires monitoring by the requisite health care professionals. See Record \nDocument 641 at 110-111 (citing Burns Liability Trial Tr. vol. V at 1371:14-1372:17 \n124 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 754   Filed 07/18/24   Page 127 of 172 PageID #: \n55287\n[Record Document 539]; Pacholke Liability Trial Tr. vol. XII at 2750:11-2751:16 [Record \nDocument 553]).  \nThe Court finds that DWCC has continued to employ practices and procedures \nagainst inmates on standard and extreme suicide watch that subject some of its most \nvulnerable inmates to mental and emotional torture. Officials at DWCC continue to use \nsuicide watch to punish inmates. This is explicitly demonstrated by the fact that inmates \nare  deprived  of  their  personal  property  for  extended  periods  of  time  without  proper \njustification; inmates are assigned to suicide watch for misbehaving or exhibiting signs of \nmental decompensation; inmates are pepper sprayed while in restraints; and restraints are \nused  on extreme suicide watch outside of  a heath care  setting.  Because  it has been \nestablished that DWCC continues to use standard and extreme suicide watch as a means of \npunishing—not protecting—its inmates, the Court has determined that Defendants failed \nto remedy the deficiencies enunciated in its previous ruling. Plaintiffs proved that the \ndeficiencies continue to persist and will continue to persist into the future.  \nb.  Lack of Meaningful Treatment \nThe Court previously held that there were no meaningful opportunities for treatment \navailable to inmates housed on suicide watch; that inmates were not assessed before being \nplaced on suicide watch; that inmates were not provided with treatment while on suicide \nwatch; that inmates were not provided with a mental health evaluation prior to assignment \nto suicide watch; and that there is no treatment or assessment provided to inmates removed \nfrom suicide watch. See Record Document 641 at 111.  \n125 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 754   Filed 07/18/24   Page 128 of 172 PageID #: \n55288\nFirst, the Court found that DWCC failed to conduct a suicide risk assessment \ngauging the inmate’s needs and mental health history before placing him on suicide watch. \nId.  Defendants  failed  to  provide  any  evidence  proving  that  they  have  remedied  this \ndeficiency. Instead, Plaintiffs provided evidence demonstrating that officials at DWCC do \nnot conduct these assessments. The Court reviewed mental health management orders \nwhere a mental health professional ordered that an inmate be placed on suicide watch. See \ne.g., Ex. PR-B-10 at 38, 104. The Court did not see any mention of or reference to any \nassessment made before those mental health management orders occurred, nor do these \norders indicate that an assessment was conducted. In short, Defendants have failed to \nprovide evidence that they have remedied this issue.  \nSecond, during the liability phase of trial, the Court learned that inmates were not \nprovided treatment while on suicide watch. Record Document 641 at 113. Specifically, the \nCourt found that the only treatment available to inmates on suicide watch was the provision \nof psychotropic medication. Id. Dr. Seal was not involved in an inmate’s placement on \nsuicide  watch.  Id.  And  inmates  on  suicide  watch  were  not  given  an  opportunity  to \nparticipate in individual or group programming or therapy. Id. Defendants did not present \nany evidence that proved these issues have been remedied since the liability phase of trial \nor that inmates receive any additional treatment other than the prescription of psychotropic \nmedications.  \nDuring the liability phase of trial, the Court learned that Dr. Seal “did not make any \ndecisions regarding the conditions on suicide watch, did not decide when an inmate should \nbe removed from suicide watch, and did not know the differences between standard and \n126 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 754   Filed 07/18/24   Page 129 of 172 PageID #: \n55289\nextreme suicide watch.” Id. Defendants did not provide any evidence to suggest that Dr. \nSeal now plays an active role in the decision regarding whether to place an inmate on \nsuicide watch. Dr. Seal did testify that it was his “understanding” that inmates on suicide \nwatch are “sometimes” assigned to his next clinic. Seal Remedy Trial Tr. vol. III at 643:2-\n16 [Record Document 706]. Thus, an inmate on suicide watch gets no other psychiatric \nevaluation of his current condition, past mental health symptoms, or help unless he just \nhappens to be assigned to Dr. Seal’s next clinic. However, at that clinic visit, Dr. Seal is \nnot provided records that would give a narrative of the events that led to the inmate’s \nassignment to suicide watch. In other words, as Dr. Seal testified, during the clinic he is \nonly “verbally” informed by the mental health personnel that the inmate is on suicide \nwatch. Id. at 643:17-644:13. Dr. Seal could not enunciate a date when this practice of oral \nreporting began. See id. at 644:14-17. The Court also learned during Dr. Seal’s testimony \nthat it is not his typical practice to make a note in his record of whether an inmate he is \nseeing has been on suicide watch. See id. at 641:14-642:1. In summary, it appears as though \nDr. Seal’s claim during the liability phase of trial—that his “job is only to diagnose and to \nprovide medication”—continues to be true in the present day. See Record Document 641 \nat 113. Furthermore, the lack of information about an inmate’s status on suicide watch calls \ninto question Dr. Seal’s ability to effectively diagnose and treat an inmate’s mental illness.  \nDefendants reference language in the suicide prevention policy that requires that an \ninmate on standard and/or extreme suicide watch be evaluated every twenty-four and \ntwelve hours, respectively. Ex. JR-14 at 8 [Record Document 715-14]. The fact that an \nevaluation is conducted does not mean that an inmate is actually receiving any form of \n127 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 754   Filed 07/18/24   Page 130 of 172 PageID #: \n55290\ntherapy with a qualified mental health clinician, only that the policy requires that an inmate \nbe visited by a mental health clinician within a prescribed period. The Court did not review \nany documentation to indicate that an inmate on suicide watch received any substantive \ntherapy or treatment, either individually or in a group setting. Nor did Defendants provide \nany evidence to suggest that inmates on suicide watch were allowed to attend any group \nprogramming. As in the liability phase, the DWCC policy and procedures center on \n“checking boxes” rather than providing treatment.  \nThere  was  also  an  absence  of  evidence  regarding  any  specific  evaluation \nadministered and documented to remove an inmate from suicide watch. During the liability \nphase of trial, Hayden testified that inmates were removed from suicide watch when they \ntold him that they were no longer suicidal. Record Document 641 at 116 (citing Hayden \nLiability Trial Tr. vol. III at 581:6-18 [Record Document 536]). This practice continues. \nFinally,  Defendants  did  not  provide  any  evidence  to  suggest  that  inmates  are \nassessed after they are removed from suicide watch. The suicide prevention policy requires \nthat “follow-up contact” be made with the inmate by a member of the mental health staff \nwithin seven days of suicide watch being discontinued “to assess the offender’s current \nmental status and suicide intent.” Ex. JR-14 at 7. However, Defendants did not present any \ntestimony to prove whether this “follow-up contact” takes place and if it does, what that \nassessment is comprised of.  \nIn short, the Court finds that officials at DWCC continue to provide inadequate \nmental health treatment to inmates on standard and extreme suicide watch. Defendants do \nnot conduct a risk assessment of inmates prior to their assignment to suicide watch; Dr. \n128 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 754   Filed 07/18/24   Page 131 of 172 PageID #: \n55291\nSeal  is  not  notified  that  his  patient  is  assigned  to  suicide  watch;  inmates  are  not \nautomatically seen by Dr. Seal immediately upon their assignment to suicide watch or even \nduring his next clinic; inmates are not provided any individual or group therapy or allowed \nto attend any group programming during or after placement on suicide watch; and there are \nno evaluations or assessments conducted to remove an inmate from suicide watch or after \nhe  is  removed  from  suicide  watch.  In  short—in  continuing  to  rely  on  psychotropic \nmedication without any sort of treatment or therapy—Defendants failed to remedy these \ndeficiencies. Plaintiffs proved that inmates continue to be put at substantial risk of harm \nand will continue to be at risk of harm into the future.  \nc.  Failures in Observing Inmates on Suicide Watch \nIn  its  liability  phase  opinion,  the  Court  held  that  there  were  failures  in  the \nobservation of inmates on suicide watch that rose to the level of a constitutional violation. \nRecord Document 641 at 116. Specifically, the Court identified issues with DWCC’s \nprocesses in monitoring inmates on suicide watch. Id. at 116-118. During the liability phase \nof trial, the Court learned that DWCC policy mandated that inmates either received \nconstant monitoring via the surveillance camera or through in-person rounds by a tier \nofficer every fifteen minutes. Id. at 117. Despite this policy, the Court learned that the \ncameras on these tiers were frequently inoperable, and the cameras that were functional \nwere not angled to capture a proper vantage point of the cell. Further, expert testimony \nfrom the liability phase showed that even if the cameras were operable, they should only \nbe used as a supplement to face-to-face observations. Id. at 117.  \n129 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 754   Filed 07/18/24   Page 132 of 172 PageID #: \n55292\nSince  the  liability  phase  of  trial,  there  have  been  no  changes  to  the  camera \nsurveillance used at DWCC or the frequency with which a security team member conducts \nhis  rounds.  However,  since  the  liability  phase  of  trial—specifically,  sometime  after \nOctober 2021—DWCC began to utilize inmate tier walkers to monitor individuals who are \non suicide watch.58 Ex. JR-60 at ¶ 72 [Record Document 715-54]. Tier walkers are inmates \nwho observe the inmates housed on suicide watch. Ex. JR-18 at 3 [Record Document 715-\n17]. Tier walkers are utilized twenty-four hours a day while an inmate is on suicide watch. \nEx. JR-60 at ¶ 72 [Record Document 715-54]. Characterized as another tool of security—\nand not of the mental health department—the tier walkers sit in a chair close to the inmates \non suicide watch. Sherman Remedy Trial Tr. vol. II at 399:4-16 [Record Document 705]. \nShould an inmate begin to engage in self-injurious behavior, the tier walker is advised to \nalert security “within [the security’s] 15-minute round.” Id.   \nAssistant Warden Sherman oversees the tier walker program at DWCC and the \nselection of inmate participants, though other prison personnel typically complete the first \nstep in recommending an inmate for the program. Id. at 397:15-24 [Record Document 705]. \nA mental health clinician will perform a records review on a recommended inmate and \nthen  Assistant  Warden  Sherman  determines  whether  that  inmate  meets  the  criteria \nenumerated in the tier walker policy, titled Employee Policy Memorandum #03-02-010. \nId. at 398:3-11. To qualify as a tier walker under EPM #03-02-010, an inmate must either \n \n58 Although the implementation of a tier walker program did not take place until late 2021, \nDWCC’s policy on suicide prevention dated May 17, 2019—formally, Employee Policy \nMemorandum #03-02-010—allowed for the utilization of tier walkers “to supplement staff \nobservation.” Ex. J-10 at 1-5 [Record Document 565-17].  \n130 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 754   Filed 07/18/24   Page 133 of 172 PageID #: \n55293\nbe designated as a LOC-4 or -5, must not have been under a mental health management \norder in the past three years, must not pose a security concern, must be deemed “medically \nappropriate,” must have no enemy concerns, and must not have been reviewed for a PREA \ndesignation. Ex. JR-18 at 7 [Record Document 715-17]. An inmate who meets all of the \ncriteria and passes the record review is then offered an interview with Assistant Warden \nSherman. Sherman Remedy Trial Tr. vol. II at 397:21-3989:11 [Record Document 705]. \nInmates who are hired as tier walkers must then complete tier walker training. Ex. \nJR-18 at 2-3 [Record Document 715-17]. A mental health clinician and a member of the \nnursing staff train the inmate. Id. at 3. As of August 2022, Burgos was the primary person \nconducting the training, though Robinson was able and available to conduct the training in \nhis absence. Burgos Remedy Trial Tr. vol IV at 774:7-12 [Record Document 707]. The \nmental health component of the training includes: 1) a discussion wherein the inmate is \ninformed of his clearance for the role; 2) the expectations and responsibilities of the role, \nwhich encompass observing and reporting potentially harmful activity and changes in the \nobserved inmate’s physical status and providing peer support; 3) the potential manipulation \ntactics of a monitored inmate and how to avoid “risky situations”; 4) the importance of the \ntier walker to a monitored inmate’s “team plan”; and 5) the liabilities the inmate may incur \nin this role—there are none. Ex. JR-18 at 5-6 [Record Document 715-17]. A member of \nnursing staff will then train the inmate on communicable diseases and the importance of \ntaking any necessary protections; the proper use of personal protective equipment; and how \nto clean up or dispose of human waste, including blood and/or other bodily fluids. Id. at 6.  \n131 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 754   Filed 07/18/24   Page 134 of 172 PageID #: \n55294\nDr. Burns opined that—although a useful and helpful supplementary tool at security \nstaff’s disposal—tier walkers should not act as a substitute for security staff’s observation \nof an inmate on suicide watch. Burns Remedy Trial Tr. vol. VIII at 1682:8-1683:21 \n[Record Document 722]. Specifically, Dr. Burns testified that: \nSo having someone right there on-site who has been trained to basically get \nhelp if the person is engaging in self-harm or attempting self-harm sooner \nthan that 15-minute round by the officer, when the key room officer is \npreoccupied with doing the other things that the key room officer has to do, \nthat is a supplement to staff supervision, but it doesn’t totally replace it \nbecause the tier walker still has to get the attention of the correctional staff \nto do anything. I mean, he can yell and shout and tell the guy to stop it, but -\n- but he still has to either run over to the key room if the door is open or \npound on the door. So there is still some delay[]. \nId. at 1683:7-18. In fact, DWCC’s own suicide policy echoes Dr. Burns’s assessment that \ntier walkers are only a supplemental aid to the prison’s obligation to monitor inmates on \nsuicide watch. Specifically, the policy states that tier walkers may be used to “supplement \nstaff observation. . . . [The] use of tier walkers shall not relieve security officers of their \nobligation to observe and document offender behaviors at regular intervals.” Ex. JR-14 at \n7 [Record Document 715-14].  \nAdditionally, Dr. Burns testified that she would expect tier walkers to be trained on \nthe importance of confidentiality in their role. Burns Remedy Trial Tr. vol. VII at 1595:19-\n1596:4 [Record Document 710]. Moreover, a mentoring program would assist a tier walker \nbecause the job can be “overwhelming,” and it would be useful for the inmate to be able to \nask a fellow tier walker about the role and to discuss any concerns. Id. at 1596:5-10. \nUltimately, Dr. Burns opined that the use of tier walkers does not remedy the issues she \nidentified during the liability phase concerning DWCC’s failure to observe its inmates on \n132 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 754   Filed 07/18/24   Page 135 of 172 PageID #: \n55295\nsuicide watch. She reurged her opinion that these inmates should be placed in a health care \nsetting with medical monitoring systems. Id. at 1595:2-3.  \nDespite the implementation of the tier walker program, the Court finds that the \ncontinued use of suicide watch without adequate monitoring is a continuing systemic \ndeficiency that Defendants have failed to remedy. Plaintiffs proved that this deficiency \ncontinues to exist and will continue to exist into the future.   \nd.  Inadequate Reporting Mechanisms \nDuring the remedy phase, the Court learned of the inadequate systems of reporting \ndata regarding suicidal behavior to the DOC. Warden Goodwin submits monthly C-05 \nReports  to  the  DOC.  Goodwin  Remedy  Trial  Tr.  vol.  VIII  at  1768:13-15  [Record \nDocument 722]. C-05 reports document three categories of incidents that occur at DWCC. \n“Category A” incidents include escapes, deaths that occur as a result of something other \nthan a natural cause, and assaults resulting in a life-threatening injury. These Category A \nincidents must be reported with appropriate documentation to Chief Smith within twenty-\nfour hours. Id. at 1768:16-1769:10. “Category B” incidents include assaults resulting in a \n“significant injury,” hunger strikes, and suicide attempts. Id at 1769:11-14; see PR-E-1 at \n3. Those incidents must be reported with the relevant documentation to Chief Smith within \nseventy-two hours. Id. at 1769:15-20. Finally, “Category C” incidents include sex offenses, \nassaults resulting in a minor injury, and suicidal gestures. See PR-E-1 at 3. \nAccording to the C-05 reports submitted by Warden Goodwin, there were no suicide \nattempts or suicidal gestures at DWCC between March 2020 and May 2022. See Ex. PR-\nE-28 at 1-2. If these reports are accurate, than the Court wonders why anyone was placed \n133 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 754   Filed 07/18/24   Page 136 of 172 PageID #: \n55296\non suicide watch during this time period. But these reports are not accurate. The reports \nare inconsistent with the UORs and inmate mental health records that the Court reviewed. \nFor example, on November 4, 2021, inmate J.W. was placed on suicide watch after he tied \nhis sheet to the bars of his cell and wrapped it around his neck. See PR-B-17 at 438-439, \n479 [Record Document 716-27]. In a UOR, Officer Need detailed that a “Hoffman knife” \nwas required to remove the sheet from inmate J.W.’s neck and from the bars. Id. at 479. \nDespite  this,  the  incident  was  not  recorded  on  the  C-05  reporting  for  the  month  of \nNovember. Warden Goodwin acknowledged eleven other suicidal-type incidents that he \nfailed  to  report  as  required  in  the  C-05  reports,  despite  DWCC’s  internal  records \n“documenting the incidents.” See Goodwin Remedy Trial Tr. vol. VIII at 1798:5-1848:16 \n[Record Document 722].  \nThis testimony makes it clear that DWCC underreported the number of suicidal \nattempts and gestures that occur at its facility. Warden Goodwin claimed that Deputy \nWarden Dauzat reviews the documents with a member of the medical staff to determine \nwhether an incident constitutes a suicidal attempt or gesture. Id. at 802:3-7. He further \nasserted that there is no benefit to underreporting or underestimating the numbers of \nincidents in the C-05 reports. Id. at 1844:23-1845:18.  \nThe  Court  will  not  speculate  as  to  why  DWCC  has  underestimated  and \nunderreported  the  number  of  suicidal  gestures  and  attempts  in  these  C-05  reports. \nCertainly, the Court has reviewed enough records over the course of the past two trials to \nconclude that this data is inaccurate and flawed. It is immaterial whether this is intentional \nor simply another example of DWCC’s inability to adequately  report and document \n134 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 754   Filed 07/18/24   Page 137 of 172 PageID #: \n55297\npertinent inmate information. Simply put, DWCC fails to report these serious incidents to \nthe DOC. The DOC needs accurate information to support its institutions. Certainly, the \nCourt would hope that the DOC would provide DWCC with resources and institutional \nsupport if it recognized that DWCC had a high volume of suicide attempts and gestures \nover the course of several months. At a minimum, it would at least give DWCC important \ndata points to track the effectiveness of the mental health programs that are offered to \ninmates.  \nIn summary, DWCC has exhibited, yet again, a blatant disregard for the health and \nwell-being of its inmates. Defendants have failed to remedy its inadequate reporting \nmechanisms. Plaintiffs proved that this deficiency continues to exist and will continue to \nexist into the future.   \n7.  Manifestations of Harm \nFor the above reasons, the Court has already found that DWCC puts its inmates at \nrisk of substantial risk of harm. However, this harm is not merely theoretical. The Court \nfinds that, in addition to all of the previously enunciated examples wherein an inmate’s \nphysical and mental health has been harmed while in DWCC’s care, the two completed \nsuicides at DWCC are representative of the extent of the severe risk of harm in which these \ndeficient policies and procedures place victims. These two suicides are illustrative of the \ndeficient policies and procedures discussed above.    \n135 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 754   Filed 07/18/24   Page 138 of 172 PageID #: \n55298\na.  J.B.59 \nThe first inmate to commit suicide since the liability phase of trial was J.B. The \nCourt will provide a synopsis of what J.B.’s medical, mental health, and prison records \nrevealed about the weeks leading up to his death. On December 13, 2021, J.B. was placed \nin investigative segregation after receiving a series of rule infractions. Ex. PR-B-4 at 79 \n[Record Document 716-13 at 1]. According to the disciplinary report, J.B. got into a \nphysical altercation with another inmate while in the North Compound’s kitchen. Id. at 81. \nDespite  being  placed  in  restraints,  J.B.  continued  to  act  belligerently  by  screaming \nprofanities,  threatening  individuals,  striking  an  officer,  making  sexual  gestures,  and \nclaiming to be high. Id. Alma Burns, the officer who separated the inmates, stated that J.B. \nappeared to be “in a daze,” was unable to articulate where he was, and had “redness in his \neyes.” Id. Coleman and Nail responded to the altercation. Id. at 79. At several points, Nail \nplaced his hand on J.B.’s shoulder to escort him out of the office, and J.B. jerked away. Id. \nChemical spray was then employed in order to help the officers “regain[] compliance” of \nJ.B. because “[n]o offender shall obstruct or resist staff in the performance of their duties.” \nId. From this incident, J.B. received three rule violations: one infraction for intoxication \nand two for defiance. Id. at 79-81.  \nHayden visited J.B. that same day. On the mental health progress note documenting \nthat interaction, Hayden noted that J.B. was angry, hostile, aggressive, spoke at a loud \n \n59 Out of respect to the sensitive nature of this discussion and the information it reveals \ntherein, the inmate’s name will not be disclosed. This J.B. is different from the inmate \npreviously discussed. See supra p. 120.  \n136 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 754   Filed 07/18/24   Page 139 of 172 PageID #: \n55299\nvolume, and exhibited poor judgment. Ex. PR-B-4 at 181-82 [Record Document 716-14 at \n7-8]. Hayden did not check any of the boxes indicating that J.B. vocalized or exhibited any \nsuicidal ideations or behaviors. Id. at 182. Nevertheless, Hayden assigned J.B. to standard \nsuicide watch for “voicing suicidal ideations.” Id.  \nAlthough placed on standard suicide watch, J.B. was not seen by Dr. Seal until \nDecember 22, 2021, nine days after the incident. Id. at 164. The accompanying mental \nhealth  progress  note  by  Hayden,  who  was  present  for  the  psychiatric  appointment, \nexplained that J.B. had been on standard suicide watch for nine days. Id. at 165. Hayden \nalso indicated that J.B. claimed to be “alright;” that he was “alert, oriented, and actively \nparticipated in the interview showing no signs indicative of psychiatric distress;” that he \ndenied “thoughts of self-harm or harm to others and no evidence to the contrary was \nobserved;” and that “[J.B.’s] recent suicide watch placement was due to an adverse reaction \nto ‘Mojo’ and [J.B.] request[ed] to be removed [from suicide watch].” Id. Dr. Seal’s \nprogress notes from that appointment are completely illegible. See Ex. PR-T-3 at 378 \n[Record Document 716-169 at 78]. \nOn  December  23,  2021,  J.B.  pled  guilty  to  four  rule  infractions  in  DWCC’s \ndisciplinary  court.60  Ex.  PR-B-4  at  159  [Record  Document  716-14  at  1].  For  these \nviolations,  J.B.  was  sentenced  to  disciplinary  segregation.  Id.  On  his  mental  health \nrestrictive housing appraisal, J.B. was classified as LOC-5, with no noted mental health \n \n60 There are no disciplinary reports that explain the origin of the fourth violation, which \nwas listed as a Rule 10 violation.  \n137 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 754   Filed 07/18/24   Page 140 of 172 PageID #: \n55300\nproblems, concerns, complaints, or symptoms.  Id. His behavior was deemed  “within \nnormal limits.” Id. at 159-160. In the additional comments section, Hayden wrote: \nHis grooming was appropriate and he appeared to be adequately nourished. \nHe  actively  engaged  in  our  conversation  though  his  overall  mood  was \ndysphoric. His thought process was positive and goal oriented as evidenced \nby his voicing plans to, ‘[j]ust put all this bullshit behind me and get back \nhere.’  He  denies  thoughts of  harm to himself or others and refused the \nrecommendation for a follow up visit with Dr. Seal.  \nId. at 160. Under the follow up plan, Hayden wrote “[o]ffender was informed that a follow \nup appointment with Dr. Seal is available upon his request. He was instructed to report \nemerging symptoms or distress to mental health staff.” Id. Hayden then described J.B. as \nbeing “dysphoric,” positive, and goal oriented. Dysphoria is commonly recognized as a \nsymptom of mental illness and signifies that an individual is feeling unhappy or unwell. \nHayden gave no explanation for his contradictory findings.61 \n  On December 29, 2021, Hayden had a follow up visit with J.B. Ex. PR-B-4 at 161 \n[Record Document 716-14 at 3]. On the mental health progress note for that visit, Hayden \nagain selected the box to indicate “dysphoric” mood, but also selected the box to indicate \na positive attitude and being within normal limits of other behavioral indicators. Id. at 162. \nIn the clinical notes section, Hayden wrote:  \nOffender was seen while standing at his cell bars peering onto the tier in \nwhich he was housed. His grooming was appropriate and he appeared to be \nadequately nourished. He actively engaged in our conversation though his \noverall mood was dysphoric. His thought process was positive and goal \noriented as evidenced by his voicing plans to, ‘[j]ust put all this bullshit \nbehind me and get back here.’ He did express remorse for his actions that \n \n61 During the remedy phase of trial, Hayden was able to accurately define “dysphoric” as \n“unpleasant, just not happy with the situation,” Hayden Remedy Trial Tr. vol. VI at \n1165:22-1166:6 [Record Document 709].  \n138 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 754   Filed 07/18/24   Page 141 of 172 PageID #: \n55301\nwarranted his segregation placement. Particularly the treatment of his friend \nin which he attacked. He denies thoughts of harm to himself or others and \nrefused the recommendation for a follow up visit with Dr. Seal. Offender was \ninformed that a follow up appointment with Dr. Seal is available upon his \nrequest. He was instructed to report emerging symptoms or distress to mental \nhealth.  \nId. In comparing Hayden’s notes from December 23 and 29, it is clear that Hayden did not \npartake in a meaningful visit with J.B. Hayden’s notes on December 29 are merely a copy \nand paste recitation from the visit the week prior, but with a few sentences added. This is \nfurther demonstrated by the continued misuse of the word “dysphoric,” as well as the exact \nsame “quote” from J.B. There are no further documented interactions between J.B. and \nmental health or security staff between December 29, 2021, and January 6, 2022.  \nOn January 6, 2022, J.B. committed suicide. See PR-H-2 at 1 [Record Document \n716-85]. According to the death report, on the morning of his death, J.B. made a sick call \nfor “twitching and feeling bad.” Id. The death report does not indicate the time the sick call \nwas made or whether J.B. was able to visit with medical staff to address his sick call prior \nto his death. At 9:24 p.m., J.B. was “found with a ligature around his neck and had hanged \nhimself.” Id. Body camera footage from when J.B. was discovered shows that he hung \nhimself with a rope or similar material. See Ex. PR-D-05 at 01:28. As the officer arrives at \nJ.B.’s cell, J.B. is seen on his knees with his body and face pressed up against the cell front. \nId. at 0:00-0:06. An officer kicks the cell door twice and screams “hey!” Id. For over a \nminute, the two officers stand outside of J.B.’s cell, communicating on their radios and \nyelling to other officers off-camera that an inmate has hung himself. After one minute and \neleven seconds, a third officer is finally able to open J.B.’s cell. Id. at 0:00-1:11. It is worth \n139 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 754   Filed 07/18/24   Page 142 of 172 PageID #: \n55302\nnoting that none of the men appear to be in any sort of rush or acting with any urgency \nduring this time. From the time J.B. was discovered, it takes one minute and forty-nine \nseconds for one of the officers to call for a medic. Id. at 1:11-1:49. Once in the cell, it takes \nofficers an additional forty-seven seconds to cut the rope from J.B.’s neck. Id. at 1:11-1:58. \nAnd, it takes a total of two minutes from the start of the video before an officer begins chest \ncompressions. Id. at 2:00. J.B. was pronounced dead at 10:00 p.m. See PR-H-2 at 1 [Record \nDocument 716-85]. \nColonel Nail was tasked with investigating J.B.’s suicide, which is one of his job \nresponsibilities as the internal affairs investigations officer. Nail Remedy Trial Tr. vol. I at \n151:25-152:2 [Record Document 704]. Despite this, Nail testified at the remedy phase trial \nthat he was only “somewhat familiar” with DWCC’s suicide prevention policy, and he \nwould  be  unable  to  identify  it  if  shown.62  Id.  at  153:1-3;  154:14-156:16.  Nail’s \ninvestigation identified only a single deficiency: an officer was late in conducting his \nrounds. Id. Nail concluded that the officer was two minutes late in conducting his rounds \non J.B.’s tier because he was assisting a nurse on a different tier. Id. at 180:2-10. Policy \nmandated that another officer in the unit should have made that round if the officer was \nlate; however, this did not occur. Id. at 180:11-17. Officers did not receive any additional \ntraining as a result of Nail’s findings, other than the standard annual training. Id. at 180:18-\n \n62 Although he is the internal affairs investigations officer whose job is to determine if \nemployees have violated policy, he testified that he was not familiar with the disciplinary \nmatrix.

Plaintiffs presented evidence64 that in the months leading up to his suicide, he was \ntreated by Dr. Seal for his mental illness, while the medical staff was tasked with treating \nhis “seizure disorder.” Seal Remedy Trial Tr. vol. IX at 2007:5-21 [Record Document 712]. \nAccording to his mental health records, J.D. was struggling with his mental health for \n \n63 Out of respect to the sensitive nature of this discussion and the information it reveals \ntherein, the inmate’s name will not be disclosed. \n64 The Court was forced to rely upon the reports and witness testimony from this incident \nbecause there was no body camera footage offered into evidence. \n141 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 754   Filed 07/18/24   Page 144 of 172 PageID #: \n55304\nmonths prior to his suicide. The earliest record provided to the Court, dated April 21, 2020, \nis an individual progress note by Burgos. See PR-B-38 at 110-111 [Record Document 716-\n39]. Burgos saw J.D. “per staff request” after he “expressed suicidal ideations while \nmaking rounds.” Id. at 111. Burgos explained that J.D. “stated he felt extremely anxious \nand stated he felt his medication was ineffective. In plain view were bedsheets torn into \nstrips, however, offender denied suicidal ideation. Security removed the torn bedsheets \nprior to my departure of the area. Will follow-up per policy.” Id. Despite displaying a \nsuicidal gesture, Burgos did not assign J.D. to suicide watch. There was no documentation \nadmitted into evidence, nor was there testimony at trial to indicate whether mental health \nstaff followed up with J.D. “per policy,” or if he was referred to or seen by Dr. Seal after \ncomplaining about his medication. \nThe next records are two requests for mental health services addressed to the mental \nhealth department and Hayden, dated May 22, 2020, and May 26, 2020, respectively. See \nPR-B-38 at 107, 109 [Record Document 716-38]. These requests were sent by medical \nstaff at DWCC. Id. The first request states that “[o]ffender requests to be seen by mental \nhealth staff due to having numerous episodes of anxiety.” Id. at 109. The second request \nstates “C/O ANXIETY MEDS ARE NOT WORKIN[G]. C/O SLEEPING ALL DAY \nAND NOT ABLE TO SLEEP AT NIGHT. C/O A BUZZING NOISE IN HIS HEAD.” Id. \nat 107. Both referrals were received by Hayden on May 26, 2020, who summarized the \ncomplaints as “[o]ffender reports daily seizures causing him blackouts and stress.” Id. at \n107, 109. Defendants offered no evidence to explain the inconsistency between J.D.’s \ncomplaints and Hayden’s summary. The follow-up plan for both of those requests was to \n142 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 754   Filed 07/18/24   Page 145 of 172 PageID #: \n55305\n“[r]efer to medical and follow up per policy.” Id. Again, there was no evidence or testimony \nthat would signify that mental health staff followed up with J.D., or that he was referred to \nor seen by Dr. Seal during Dr. Seal’s next shift at DWCC, or that he was seen by other \nmedical staff. \nIndeed, the records show that it was not until several weeks later, on June 18, 2020, \nthat Dr. Seal saw J.D. Id. at 114. However, Dr. Seal’s offender progress note is almost \ncompletely illegible. In fact, the Court was only able to independently ascertain the date, \nthe phrase “2 weeks,” and a diagnosis of “Bipolar I.”65 Id. There is also an incomplete \nprogress note by Hayden appearing to have been filled out during an appointment with Dr. \nSeal; however, there is no date listed to indicate when this appointment took place. Id. at \n106.  \nThe  final  record  admitted  into  evidence66  is  a  July  16,  2020,  note  from  J.D. \nrequesting medical treatment. Id. at 78. In the note, J.D., who was assigned to N-4-D-5 at \nthe time, writes, “can I be put back on my crazy mental health medicine I don’t know the \nname. It’s a tan, football pill I have been out of my medicine almost a month I need it.” Id. \nThe member of medical staff referred J.D. to the mental health department, noting that his \nmedications were “stopped a month ago.” Id. Again, there was no evidence presented to \nindicate that a mental health clinician ever followed up with J.D. or that his request for \n \n65 The Court has already discussed the issues with Dr. Seal’s illegible notes. See supra pp. \n101-02; accord Record Document 641 at 106.  \n66 Not all of J.D.’s medical or mental health records were offered into evidence. The Court \nonly relied upon the records admitted into evidence when making its factual findings.   \n143 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 754   Filed 07/18/24   Page 146 of 172 PageID #: \n55306\nmedication was fulfilled. There was also no explanation provided regarding why his \nmedication was discontinued despite a diagnosis of Bipolar I.  \nJ.D.  died  by  suicide  on  October  28,  2020,  while  still  in  custody  at  DWCC. \nAccording to Warden Goodwin, the institutional investigation into J.D.’s suicide found no \nwrongdoing. Goodwin Remedy Trial Tr. vol. IX at 1916:19-22 [Record Document 712].  \n  The Court identifies the following non-exhaustive list of previously enunciated \ndeficiencies visible in a review of J.D.’s record: 1) the illegibility of Dr. Seal’s records; 2) \nmedication non-compliance; 3) inadequate administration of medication; 4) inadequate \nrecord keeping practices; 4) the lack of mental health treatment; 5) the lack of psychiatric \ntreatment;  6)  Hayden’s  lack  of  qualifications  and  training;  and  7)  the  failure  of  the \ninstitution to accurately investigate and assess its own actions. \nii.  Deliberate Indifference \nThe Court turns next to the deliberate  indifference  of the Eighth Amendment \ninquiry,  having  determined  that  Plaintiffs  met  their  burden  in  proving  that  systemic \ndeficiencies continue to exist in the policies and procedures in all six areas of mental health \ntreatment at DWCC, including: screening and evaluations; effective and individualized \ntreatment; staffing; safeguards to the administration of psychotropic medications; accurate \nrecord  keeping;  and  the  maintenance  of  an  effective  suicide  prevention  program.  In \napplying Ruiz, the Court finds that correctional officials at DWCC continue to demonstrate \nnon-compliance with DWCC’s own policies and have demonstrated a clear and wanton \ndisregard of inmates’ mental health status and treatment. \n \n144 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 754   Filed 07/18/24   Page 147 of 172 PageID #: \n55307\n1.  Failure to Comply with Policy \nDuring the liability phase of trial, the Court held that Defendants and other staff at \nDWCC “consciously decided not to comply with its policies.” Record Document 641 at \n119. First, the Court determined that mental health staff did not comply with Employee \nPolicy Memorandum #03-02-003 (“EPM #03-02-003”). Id. This policy requires DWCC \nstaff to complete weekly rounds; provide inmates classified as LOC-2, -3, or -4 with a \nmental  health  evaluation  every  30,  90,  and  180  days;  create  and  annually  review \nindividualized mental health treatment plan for inmates with those LOC designations; and \nprovide mental health services to inmates upon request. Id.  \nEPM #03-02-003 was updated on March 22, 2022. See Ex. JR-15 at 1 [Record \nDocument 715-15]. The policy added provisions for treatment segregation and made \nchanges to the requirements for assigning an inmate to segregated housing. Compare id., \nwith Ex. J-7 [Record Document 565-13]. However, the requirements regarding weekly \nrounds, mental health evaluations, treatment plans, and the provision of mental health \nservices remain the same. And, as the Court has already discussed in depth, Defendants \nhave  not  remedied  the  previously  enunciated  deficiencies  in  these  areas.  As  such, \nDefendants are still not compliant with EPM #03-02-003.  \nAdditionally, during the liability phase, the Court found that Defendants failed to \ncomply with Employee Policy Memorandum #03-02-001 (“EPM #03-02-001”), which \nrequired that mental health staff “utiliz[e] the least restrictive management necessary to \nprevent an inmate’s self-harm,” provide inmates in the restraint chair with the requisite \n145 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 754   Filed 07/18/24   Page 148 of 172 PageID #: \n55308\nnumber of breaks, and observe offenders  who are  housed on suicide watch. Record \nDocument 641 at 120 (citing Ex. J-10 at 6-8 [Record Document 565-17]).  \nEPM #03-02-001 was updated on March 21, 2022. See Ex. JR-14 at 1 [Record \nDocument 715-14]. The policy added a provision for treatment segregation and the tier \nwalker program. Compare id., with Ex. J-10 at 6-8 [Record Document 565-17]. Plaintiffs \ndid not provide the Court with any evidence that the restraint chair is being utilized without \naffording inmates the requisite number of breaks. As such, there is no indication that \nDefendants are violating this aspect of the policy. However, Defendants have not remedied \nthe previously enunciated deficiencies regarding the use of least restrictive management \nnecessary or the observation of inmates on suicide watch. As such, the Court finds that \nDefendants continue to act in non-compliance with EPM #03-02-001.  \nDWCC fails to comply with Employee Policy Memorandum #03-01-001 (“EPM \n#03-01-001”). EMP #03-01-001 states that inmates with “serious mental illness shall not \nbe placed in segregate housing . . . unless . . . [they are] [c]leared by appropriate [m]ental \n[h]ealth professional and reviewed by a psychiatrist/psychologist at earliest possible date.” \nEx. JR-10 at 4-5. However, as the Court has already discussed, there was no evidence \npresented that would prove that an inmate’s mental health considered before he is placed \nin segregated housing, despite the presence of a mental health clinician on the multi-\ndisciplinary review board. See supra pp. 56-58. Additionally, Dr. Seal admitted that his \nsole function at DWCC is to diagnose inmates with mental illness and to manage an \ninmate’s prescription of psychotropic medication. In other words, Dr. Seal does not review \n146 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 754   Filed 07/18/24   Page 149 of 172 PageID #: \n55309\nan inmate’s placement into segregated housing, as required by policy. As such, DWCC \ndoes not comply with EPM #03-01-001.  \nFinally, in the liability phase, the Court found that Defendants disregarded the risks \nand harms outlined in its training for medication administration, entitled the Pill Call \nTraining for Correctional Employees. Record Document 641 at 121. Specifically, the \nCourt  noted  that  “[t]he  policy  acknowledges  those  risks  and  cautions  employees  of \nmedication non-compliance, and yet, the policy itself shows that there is no procedure or \nprocess in place to further avoid or to mitigate these harms.” Id. Defendants have not \nremedied the previously articulated issues with the administration of medication, and as a \nresult, are still not compliant with their own policy.  \nIn summary, the Court finds that the evidence presented at trial demonstrates that \nofficials at DWCC continue to act with deliberate indifference toward inmate mental health \nby failing to comply with DWCC’s own policies that govern its practices and procedures.  \n2.  Wanton Disregard for Inmate Health and Safety \nDuring the liability phase of trial, the Court held that the mental health staff at \nDWCC exhibits a wanton disregard for inmate health and safety in each of the six Ruiz \ncriteria, Record Document 641 at 121, which, as a reminder, include: systematic screening \nand  evaluation;  treatment  that  is  more  than  mere  seclusion  or  close  supervision; \nparticipation by trained mental health professionals in appropriate numbers; safeguards \nagainst  psychotropic  medications  that  are  prescribed  in  dangerous  amounts,  without \nadequate supervision or otherwise inappropriately administered; accurate, complete, and \nconfidential records; and a suicide prevention program. Ruiz, 503 F. Supp. at 1339.  \n147 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 754   Filed 07/18/24   Page 150 of 172 PageID #: \n55310\nAs to the first Ruiz factor, screening and evaluation, the Court finds that DWCC \ncontinues to exhibit a wanton disregard of inmate health and safety. In support of this \nconclusion, the Court points to: 1) Hayden’s lack of qualifications to conduct the initial \nassessments required by the intake process; 2) the inadequacy of the initial intake forms; \n3)  the  failure  to  ask  meaningful  questions  during  intake  evaluations;  4)  the  lack  of \nmeaningful review of intake evaluations by a qualified mental health professional; 5) the \nlack of timely and meaningful follow-up of intake evaluations by mental health staff; 6) \nthe failure of mental health staff to address an inmate’s individual needs at intake; 7) the \nfailure of the mental health staff to conduct and/or sufficiently document weekly rounds; \n8) Hayden’s lack of qualifications to conduct the thirty- and ninety-day segregated housing \ninterviews and the lack of supervision and audit of his assessments; 9) the failure to conduct \nand/or the untimely nature of the segregated housing interviews; 10) the failure to conduct \nthe evaluation of LOC-2, -3, and -4 inmates; 11) the cell-front, non-confidential nature of \nthe segregated housing interviews; 12) the implementation of a deficient form, the Form \n350; and 13) the inadequate evaluation and documentation of mental health status during \nsegregated housing and LOC-2, -3, and -4 interviews.  \nAs to the second Ruiz factor, the provision of mental health treatment, the Court \nfinds that DWCC continues to exhibit a wanton disregard of inmate health and safety. In \nsupport of this conclusion, the Court points to: 1) the lack of meaningful or substantive \nindividualized treatment plans for inmates diagnosed with mental illness; 2) the lack of \nstaff training on the mental health treatment plans; 3) the failure to consult all relevant \nstakeholders, including the prison psychiatrist, when crafting  any treatment plans; 4) \n148 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 754   Filed 07/18/24   Page 151 of 172 PageID #: \n55311\nHayden’s lack of qualifications to sign-off on all treatment plans; 5) the absence of any \nmetrics to measure an inmate’s progress towards the completion of his treatment plan; 6) \nthe reliance on psychotropic medication as the sole mental health therapy; 7) the lack of \nany individual or group therapy or counseling; 8) the deficiencies in the psychiatric \nservices, including the lack of provisions that would ensure inmate confidentiality during \nany future, in-person psychiatric appointments and the insufficient time spent with inmates \nduring those appointments; 9) the illegibility of Dr. Seal’s notes; and 10) the inadequate \ncorrespondence courses and therapeutic materials offered to inmates.  \nAs to the third Ruiz factor, staffing, the Court finds that DWCC continues to exhibit \na wanton disregard of inmate health and safety. In support of this conclusion, the Court \npoints to: 1) Dr. Seal’s failure to comply with the provisions of his contract and the job \nresponsibilities outlined therein; 2) DWCC’s failure to adequately staff the mental health \ndepartment; and 3) DWCC’s failure to hold its staff accountable for policy violations. \nAs to the fourth Ruiz factor, administration of psychotropic medication, the Court \nfinds that DWCC continues to exhibit a wanton disregard of inmate health and safety. In \nsupport of this conclusion, the Court points to: 1) the failure to create or maintain processes \nby which an inmate’s missed medication can be accurately recorded and tracked; 2) the \nlack of oversight of the Pill Call Officers; 3) the use of security personnel instead of medical \npersonnel for medication administration; 4) the failure to create or maintain processes by \nwhich an inmate’s missed medication can be addressed or remedied; 5) the improper \nadministration of psychotropic medications, including at the wrong time intervals; and 6) \nthe treating psychiatrist’s lack of training on and access to the E-MAR system.  \n149 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 754   Filed 07/18/24   Page 152 of 172 PageID #: \n55312\nAs to the fifth Ruiz factor, an adequate record keeping process, the Court finds that \nDWCC continues to exhibit a wanton disregard of inmate health and safety. In support of \nthis conclusion, the Court points to: 1) the practice of duplicating inmate mental health \nrecords en masse; 2) Dr. Seal’s illegible notes; 3) inaccuracies in various inmate forms and \nmental health evaluations; and 4) the failure to maintain a list of inmates on the mental \nhealth caseload, specifically those designated as LOC-4.  \nAs to the sixth Ruiz factor, the implementation of an adequate suicide prevention \nprogram, the Court finds that DWCC continues to exhibit a wanton disregard of inmate \nhealth and safety. In support of this conclusion, the Court points to: 1) the punitive nature \nof suicide watch; 2) the conditions of standard and extreme suicide watch, including but \nnot limited to the lack of a mattress and the use of restraints; 3) the failure to develop a \nspecific treatment plan for inmates on suicide watch; 4) the lack of an assessment by a \nqualified mental health provider immediately when someone is placed on suicide watch; \n5) the lack of mental health treatment during an inmate’s stay on suicide watch; 6) the lack \nof an assessment by a qualified mental health provider when someone is taken off suicide \nwatch; 7) the failure to routinely notify the treating psychiatrist of the inmate’s placement \non suicide watch, including the facts surrounding the placement and its duration; 8) the \nfailure to observe an inmate at the required intervals as required per policy; 9) the failure \nto adequately investigate UORs which lead to suicide  watch; and  10) the failure to \nadequately report suicide attempts or gestures to the DOC.  \nIn summary, the Court finds that Plaintiffs met their burden in proving that DWCC \nand the DOC continue to act with deliberate indifference to inmate mental health care and \n150 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 754   Filed 07/18/24   Page 153 of 172 PageID #: \n55313\ntreatment at DWCC, and that they will continue to act with this deliberate indifference into \nthe future. Conversely, Defendants failed to present evidence that they no longer act with \ndeliberate indifference to inmate health and safety. Plaintiffs have satisfied the second \nprong of the Eighth Amendment analysis and proved that, absent any injunctive relief, \nDefendants will continue to violate the constitutional rights of inmates housed on the South \nCompound, especially those with a diagnosed mental illness.  \niii.  Conclusion as to Delivery of Mental Health Services \nDuring the liability phase of trial, the Court identified the systemic deficiencies in \nthe six areas of DWCC’s mental health program, which result in the systemic failure to \nprovide  inmates  on  the  South  Compound,  especially  those  with  mental  illness,  with \nadequate  mental health care and  treatment.  In implementing these deficient policies, \npractices, and procedures in its mental health program, officials at DWCC exhibit a wanton \ndisregard for inmate health and safety.  \nThe Court finds that Plaintiffs have met their burden in proving that these systemic \nfailures continue to exist, and without injunctive relief, will continue to exist in the future. \nIn other words, without intervention, inmates at DWCC will continue to be placed at a \nsubstantial risk of harm and will continue to have their Eighth Amendment rights violated. \nFor these reasons, the Court finds that the two-pronged Eighth Amendment inquiry has \nbeen satisfied. Plaintiffs are entitled to injunctive relief to remedy the unconstitutional \nmental health program at DWCC.   \n \n \n151 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 754   Filed 07/18/24   Page 154 of 172 PageID #: \n55314\nD. Conclusion as to the Eight Amendment Claims \nPlaintiffs have met their burden in proving that Defendants presently and will \ncontinue to violate the Eighth Amendment rights of its inmates assigned to extended \nlockdown on DWCC’s South Compound, many of whom suffer from severe mental illness. \nDefendants  violate  those  inmates’  Eighth  Amendment  rights  by  confining  them  in \ninhumane and torturous conditions in segregated housing and by failing to deliver those \ninmates with the requisite level of mental health care. In meeting their burden, Plaintiffs \nhave  proven  that  they  are  entitled  to  relief  to  alleviate  the  following  constitutional \nviolations: \n(1)  The  current  conditions  of  confinement  on  the  South  Compound,  as \ndetailed above, have the mutually enforcing effect of exposing inmates on \nextended lockdown—the Class—to a substantial risk of severe psychological \npain and suffering and depriving those inmates of their sanity in violation of \nthe Eighth Amendment. \n \n(2) DWCC’s systemic failure to deliver adequate mental health services to \ninmates on the South Compound, as detailed above, constitutes cruel and \nunusual punishment. \n \n(3) Separately from above, DWCC violated the Eighth Amendment rights of \ninmates  with  mental  illness  housed  on  the  South  Compound’s  extended \nlockdown tiers because the conditions of confinement expose those inmates \nwith mental illness to a substantial likelihood of even more psychological pain \nand suffering, including the exacerbation of their already diagnosed mental \nillness. \nVI.  ADA and RA Claims \nDuring the liability phase of trial, the Court found there to be systemic failures \nregarding DWCC’s compliance with the ADA and RA. Record Document 641 at 144-145. \nFirst, the Court held that DWCC did not consider an inmate’s mental illness before placing \n152 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 754   Filed 07/18/24   Page 155 of 172 PageID #: \n55315\nhim on extended lockdown for an indefinite period of time, nor does it consider his mental \nhealth before employing various disciplinary tactics. Id. at 145. Moreover, Defendants \nfailed to modify any of DWCC’s policies or practices as to inmates with a mental illness, \nresulting in these inmates’ exclusion from programs, activities, and services. Id. Finally, \nthe Court found that, in using an under-inclusive definition of serious mental illness, \nDWCC did not maintain an adequate system for inmates to request and receive reasonable \naccommodations. Id. As the Court has already mentioned, for inmates in confinement, \nPlaintiffs’ Eighth Amendment claims at times overlap with their ADA and RA claims.  \nA. ADA and RA Standard \nThe ADA provides that “no qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of \nsuch disability, be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services, \nprograms, or activities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any such \nentity.” 42 U.S.C. § 12132. It defines a person with a disability as one who has “a physical \nor mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities . . . .” 42 \nU.S.C. § 12102(1)(A); 28 C.F.R. § 36.105. This includes individuals with historical, but \nnot present, impairments and those who are regarded as having an impairment regardless \nof actual disability. 42 U.S.C. § 12102(1)(B)-(C). The RA states that “[n]o otherwise \nqualified individual with a disability . . . shall, solely by reason of her or his disability, be \nexcluded  from  the  participation  in,  be  denied  the  benefits  of,  or  be  subjected  to \ndiscrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance . . . .” \n29 U.S.C. § 794(a). It defines disability in the same way as the ADA. Kemp v. Holder, 610 \n153 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 754   Filed 07/18/24   Page 156 of 172 PageID #: \n55316\nF.3d 231, 234 (5th Cir. 2010). “The RA and the ADA are judged under the same legal \nstandards, and the same remedies are available under both Acts.” Id. (citations omitted).  \nTo prevail on an ADA claim, a plaintiff must prove “(1) that he has a qualifying \ndisability; (2) that he is being denied the benefits of services, programs, or activities for \nwhich the public entity is responsible, or is otherwise discriminated against by the public \nentity; and (3) that such discrimination is by reason of his disability.” Hale v. King, 642 \nF.3d 492, 499 (5th Cir. 2011). The elements of a claim under the RA are the same, except \nthat the public entity in question must be one which receives federal financial assistance.67 \nSee Kemp, 610 F.3d at 234. Plaintiffs have established, and Defendants do not dispute, that \nthe ADA and RA apply to DWCC.  \nAdditionally,  the  Court  has  already  found  that  the  Subclass  is  comprised  of \n“qualified individuals with disabilities that substantially limit one or more life activities, as \ndefined by the ADA.” Record Document 641 at 128. The Court need not reevaluate this \nfinding in the remedy phase of trial.  \nA defendant’s failure to make reasonable modifications for the unique needs of \ndisabled inmates can qualify as intentional discrimination. See, e.g., Melton v. Dall. Area \nRapid Transit, 391 F.3d 669, 672 (5th Cir. 2004); Garrett v. Thaler, 560 F. App’x 375, 382 \n(5th Cir. 2014). Mental health services have been recognized as “services” that “benefit” \nprisoners. See Pennsylvania Dep’t of Corr. v. Yeskey, 524 U.S. 206, 210 (1998) (“Modern \nprisons  provide  inmates  with  many  recreational  ‘activities,’  medical  ‘services,’  and \n \n67 The RA has certain exceptions that are not applicable to the present case.  \n154 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 754   Filed 07/18/24   Page 157 of 172 PageID #: \n55317\neducational and vocational ‘programs,’ all of which at least theoretically ‘benefit’ the \nprisoners (and any of which disabled prisoners could be ‘excluded from participation \nin’).”); Hernandez v. Cnty. of Monterey, 110 F. Supp. 3d 929, 935-36 (N.D. Cal. 2015) \n(listing mental health services). \nDuring the liability phase of trial, the Court grouped Plaintiffs’ ADA and RA claims \ninto two categories: 1) the failure to accommodate inmates with mental illness and 2) the \nadoption of methods  of administration that discriminate against  inmates with  mental \nillness. Record Document 641 at 129. The Court will address each category in turn below.  \nB. Failure to Accommodate \nDuring the liability phase of trial, the Court found that DWCC did not make any \nreasonable modifications or accommodations for inmates diagnosed with mental illness. \nAdditionally, DWCC failed to make any reasonable accommodations to the disciplinary or \nuse of force practices as applied to inmates with mental illness.68 Record Document 641 at \n130-37.  \n“In addition to their respective prohibitions of disability-based discrimination, both \nthe ADA and the [RA] impose upon public entities an affirmative obligation to make \n \n68 During the liability phase, the Court held that the evidence at trial did not support a \nfinding that DWCC disregards recommendations from the mental health staff that inmates \ndiagnosed with a serious mental illness be placed in general population as opposed to \nrestrictive housing. Record Document 641 at 137. This is because the mental health \ndepartment played no actual role in an inmate’s housing assignment. As such, this claim is \nDISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE. However, as is discussed in more detail in the body \nof this opinion, the failure of the mental health department to play a role in an inmate’s \nhousing assignment, both initially and when an inmate is assigned to segregated housing, \nis a separate issue.  \n155 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 754   Filed 07/18/24   Page 158 of 172 PageID #: \n55318\nreasonable accommodations for disabled individuals.” Cadena v. El Paso Cnty., 946 F.3d \n717, 723 (5th Cir. 2020) (citations omitted); Smith v. Harris Cnty., 956 F.3d 311, 317 (5th \nCir. 2020) (internal quotations marks and citations omitted). Although the ADA “does not \nrequire prisons to provide new services or programs for disabled prisoners,” prisons “do \nhave an affirmative obligation to make reasonable modifications . . . so that a disabled \nprisoner can have meaningful access to existing public services or programs.” Borum v. \nSwisher Cnty., No. 2:14-CV-127-J, 2015 WL 327508, at *9 (N.D. Tex. Jan. 26, 2015).  \nBelow, the Court will address each finding in the context of the remedy phase. \ni.  Affirmative Modifications \nDuring the liability phase of trial, the Court found that officials at DWCC failed to \nmake modifications as to the appropriateness of housing individuals with mental illness on \nthe  South  Compound,  nor  did  they  make  any  modifications  to  the  conditions  of \nconfinement for those individuals. Record Document 641 at 130-131. Considering the risks \nthat solitary confinement poses on inmates’ mental health and safety, the Court found that \n“[e]ven if some inmates’ active mental illness prohibits them from being safely integrated \ninto general population, DWCC’s policies and practices of failing to treat those inmates in \na way that accommodates their mental illness have the effect of excluding those inmates \nfrom many services, activities, and programs.” Id. at 132.  \nThe ADA requires that “[p]ublic entities . . . ensure that inmates or detainees with \ndisabilities are housed in the most integrated setting appropriate to the needs of the \nindividuals.” 28 C.F.R. § 35.152(b)(2). Similarly, the RA requires that “[a] public entity . \n.  .  make  reasonable  modifications  in  policies,  practices,  or  procedures  when  the \n156 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 754   Filed 07/18/24   Page 159 of 172 PageID #: \n55319\nmodifications are necessary to avoid discrimination on the basis of disability, unless the \npublic entity can demonstrate that making the modifications would fundamentally alter the \nnature of the service, program, or activity.” 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(7)(i). The “failure to \nmake reasonable accommodations to the needs of a disabled prisoner may have the effect \nof discriminating against that prisoner because the lack of an accommodation may cause \nthe disabled prisoner to suffer more pain and punishment than non-disabled prisoners.” \nMcCoy v. Tex. Dep’t of Crim. Justice, No. C-05-370, 2006 WL 2331055, at *7 (S.D. Tex. \nAug. 9, 2006). “[A] person with a disability may be the victim of discrimination precisely \nbecause she did not receive disparate treatment when she needed accommodation.” Presta \nv. Peninsula Corridor Joint Powers Bd., 16 F. Supp. 2d 1134, 1136 (N.D. Cal. 1998) \n(citation omitted). “[T]he purpose of the ADA’s reasonable accommodation requirement \nis to guard against the facade of equal treatment when particular accommodations are \nnecessary  to  level  the  playing  field.”  Badalamenti  v.  Louisiana  Dep’t  of  Wildlife  & \nFisheries, 439 F. Supp. 3d 801, 808 (E.D. La. 2020) (quoting McGary v. City of Portland, \n386 F.3d 1259, 1267 (9th Cir. 2004)) (internal quotation marks omitted). \nDuring the remedy phase of trial, Defendants asserted that DWCC “screens for \nADA issues and accommodates them.” Record Document 733 at 62. They represented that \nthe disciplinary board has the ability to “refer cases to mental health rather than prosecute \nrules violations” and  that mental health staff can “intervene  in disciplinary cases  as \nappropriate.” Id. However, Defendants failed to provide any evidence to prove that any of \nthese positive actions actually occurred. The Court reviewed no disciplinary review board \nforms, Form 350s, or interviews with a segregated inmate to indicate that mental health \n157 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 754   Filed 07/18/24   Page 160 of 172 PageID #: \n55320\nstaff intervened or offered any suggestions for modifications in disciplinary cases. Instead, \nas indicated above, Plaintiffs presented evidence that inmates displaying symptomatic \nbehavior—behavior that even a layperson could interpret as a mental health crisis—were \nsubject to punishment with no intervention by a mental health clinician.  \nDWCC also claimed that it provides two lists to the key officers: one for inmates \nwith a “serious mental illness” and one identifying the inmates who are on heat duty status. \nDefendants claim that these lists are ways in which DWCC accommodates inmates with \nmental illness. The Court has already enunciated the deficiencies with the LOC lists, \nnamely, that they do not include those inmates diagnosed as LOC-4.  \nAs to the heat duty status lists, from May to October of each year, Robinson creates \na list of inmates on heat duty status in the same manner in which she creates the list of \ninmates classified as LOC-3. Robinson Remedy Trial Tr. vol. IX at 2029:13-2030:6 \n[Record  Document  712].  This  is  important  because  inmates  who  take  psychotropic \nmedications are more susceptible to complications from exposure to high temperatures, \nand as a result, per written policy, precautions must be taken for those inmates. These heat \nduty status lists are provided to the unit managers, lieutenant colonels, administration, and \nthe nursing staff supervisors. Id. at 2030:9-12. Robinson emails the list weekly but does \nnot know how those individuals maintain the list. Id. at 2030:14-2031:3. Defendants did \nnot provide any evidence to suggest that those lists are consulted by security staff or any \nother official at DWCC before taking specific actions. In other words, just because these \nlists  are  created  does  not  necessarily  mean  that  they  are  used  to  make  reasonable \naccommodations. Other than the provision of the heat duty status lists, DWCC has adopted \n158 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 754   Filed 07/18/24   Page 161 of 172 PageID #: \n55321\nno other process or procedure to ensure that officers are aware of which inmates on their \nunits require additional climate protections. \nAdditionally,  Defendants  have  not  made  any  alterations  to  the  conditions  of \nconfinement for inmates with mental illness when they are assigned to restrictive housing. \nDWCC does not permit the Subclass to participate in the group programming, classes, and \nout-of-cell programming that are offered to inmates housed in general population, nor does \nit create specialized group programming or classes for inmates in segregated housing. \nInmates with mental illness are deprived of their personal property; of access to the \ncommon eating, recreation yard, and contact visitation; and are forced to live in solitude \nand idleness for twenty-three to twenty-four hours per day.  \nAccordingly, the Court finds that Plaintiffs met their burden in proving that DWCC \ncontinues to violate the ADA and RA with respect to affirmative modifications and will \ncontinue to violate the ADA and RA in this manner into the future.  \nii.  Discipline \nDuring the liability phase of trial, the Court found that DWCC failed to consider an \ninmate’s mental illness before disciplining or using force against those who are not posing \nan immediate safety threat. Record Document 641 at 134-37.  \nOther courts have held that the “obligation to provide accommodations applies to \nthe discipline of disabled inmates, as well . . . .” Lewis v. Cain, No. 3:15-CV-318, 2021 \nWL 1219988, at *55 (M.D. La. Mar. 31, 2021) (citation omitted). In the prison context, the \nADA and RA are violated “where a correctional officer could have used less force or no \nforce during the performance of his or her penological duties with respect to a disabled \n159 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 754   Filed 07/18/24   Page 162 of 172 PageID #: \n55322\nperson.” Id. at *56 (quoting Armstrong v. Newsom, No. 94-CV-02307 CW, 2021 WL \n933106, at *25 (N.D. Cal. Mar. 11, 2021)). A “lack of medical oversight in disciplinary \ndecisions for disabled inmates” could support a failure-to-accommodate claim under the \nADA and RA. Id. \nThe Court previously found a “concerning disconnect between security staff and the \nmental health department” and determined that security staff were not concerned with \ninmates’ mental health and routinely employed discipline and/or force without considering \nan inmate’s mental health. Record Document 641 at 135. For example, DWCC enacted a \npolicy which states that a mental health clinician must be called before deploying a \nchemical agent on an inmate on the mental health list—if the inmate is not a security \nconcern—and yet, there was no evidence to prove that security staff has ever done so. \nFurthermore, some underlying “security concerns” justifying the deployment of a chemical \nagent without first calling a mental health clinician include noise levels and kicking a cell \ndoor. Id. Additionally, the Court was presented with evidence that security deployed mace \non inmates in restraints and on suicide watch. Id.  \nThe Court finds that this has not been remedied since the liability phase of trial. \nSecurity staff are still not concerned with inmate mental health, and mental health staff still \nemploy a completely hands-off approach to discipline. First, as Coleman testified, the only \nthing that changed regarding the use of force as it relates to Employee Policy Memorandum \n#02-01-005—DWCC’s use of force policy—is that security staff are now provided with a \nlist of inmates with a diagnosed mental illness. Coleman Remedy Trial Tr. vol. I at 28:18-\n23. But, this testimony is not entirely correct. As stated above, security staff are only \n160 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 754   Filed 07/18/24   Page 163 of 172 PageID #: \n55323\nprovided with a list of inmates classified as LOC-3, which is not inclusive of all inmates \non the mental health list. Moreover, Defendants did not provide any evidence to prove that \nthese lists were actually consulted before security staff disciplines or uses force against an \ninmate. To the contrary, Plaintiffs presented evidence as outlined above that a mental health \nclinician was not consulted.  \nPlaintiffs provided the Court with several incidents where security staff disciplined \nand/or used force against inmates with a mental illness where there was no immediate \nsafety threat and without having first consulted a member of mental health staff. See e.g., \nPR-M-1 [Record Document 716-125] (where inmate T.D. alleged that pepper spray was \nemployed against him while he was on extreme suicide watch); PR-C at 820-825 [Record \nDocument 716-44] (where a chemical agent was employed against an inmate for “being \nloud and disruptive” and for throwing his breakfast tray against the cell bars); PR-C- at \n303-316 [Record Document 716-40] (where security used chemical spray against and \nsubsequently placed on suicide watch an inmate who refused to come to the cell bars).  \nAn egregious example of security staff’s disregard of inmate mental health and its \npractice of employing force against an inmate who is not posing an immediate safety \nconcern is visible in the treatment of inmate J.G. The video, dated March 15, 2022, begins \nwith three officers talking to the camera, one of whom explains that they were asked to \nrespond to the N-4 tier after an inmate was unresponsive to orders. Ex. PR-D-31 at 0:00-\n00:41. The three officers then walk up to the cell, where a naked J.G. appears in the frame. \nId. at 00:41-00:50. In the video, officers order J.G. to put on his jumpsuit and walk to the \nbars to be restrained. Id. at 00:50-01:13. Importantly, J.G. is naked but is otherwise causing \n161 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 754   Filed 07/18/24   Page 164 of 172 PageID #: \n55324\nno disturbance. He does not speak or show any resistance to the orders. Officers repeat \nthese orders as J.G. paces around his cell, attempting to put on his jumpsuit but clearly \nstruggling with the mechanics of how to do so. J.G. is obviously confused and suffering \nfrom some sort of mental decompensation. Id. at 01:13-03:03. The struggle to dress himself \nlasts for a couple of minutes. Id. J.G. does not appear to be maliciously non-compliant but \nrather fully incapable of putting on his jumpsuit, despite attempting to do so several times. \nId.  \nAfter  about  two  minutes,  a  chemical  agent  is  deployed  against  J.G.  for \napproximately two seconds without a mental health clinician being called, against DWCC \npolicy. Id. at 03:07-03:09. At that time, J.G. was not making any noise, was not acting \nviolently towards the officers, and was still simply trying to put on his jumpsuit. The Court \ndid not observe J.G. to be a security threat at the time; instead, he appears disoriented and \nfearful. J.G. gags and attempts to put on his jumpsuit. Id. at 03:09-03:24. As a reminder, \nofficers claim that they do not consult the mental health department before deploying force \nin instances where the health and safety of the institution is at risk, and yet, the officers are \nable to sit back and watch J.G. suffer without any clear or visible threat. J.G. then begins \nto rock in a fetal position on his concrete bed while holding his jumpsuit. Id. at 03:54-\n04:53. He shakes his leg as he lays in the upright fetal position.  \nAs the officers again order him to approach the bars to be restrained, J.G. stands up \nand begins pacing in a disoriented manner. Id. at 04:55-05:00. J.G. returns to his bed, where \nhe remains for a minute until an officer again asks him to approach the bars to be restrained. \nId. at 06:17. J.G. does not comply, and the officer simply watches him from the outside of \n162 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 754   Filed 07/18/24   Page 165 of 172 PageID #: \n55325\nthe cell for minutes. Id. at 06:17-13:38. Officers then deploy chemical agent a second time, \nagain without first consulting a mental health clinician. At this time, J.G. is simply sitting \non  his  bed  staring  ahead,  not  making  any  movement.  Id.  at  13:40.  The  spray  lasts \napproximately two seconds. Id. at 13:40-13:42. J.G. shakes in a ball huddled in the corner \nof his room, before he stands up and proceeds to jump. Id. at 13:42-15:00. Eventually, other \nDWCC security officers arrive and enter his cell. Ex. PR-D-33 at 08:17-08:20. J.G. is \ntransferred out of his cell, with two officers carrying him out by his arms and another \ncarrying his feet. Id. at 09:05-09:22.  \nThe mental health progress note from the incident—filled out by Hayden—did not \nindicate that a mental status exam was given to J.G., and simply provided the following \nnarrative: \nUpon arrival to offenders cell he was on the floor and had removed his issued \njumpsuit and boxer shorts. When attempting conversation, he refused to make \neye contact or acknowledge my presence. Multiple attempts were made to \ngain his attention and eye contact, which he refused to acknowledge. Further \nconversation was not attempted. Offender’s appearance and grooming were \ndisheveled. A visual scan of his cell showed it to be unkempt with urine and \nfeces spread around, his hygiene was poor. In order to gain compliance \nsecurity staff used chemical agent and a cell extraction. He was placed on \nstandard suicide watch for evaluation until seen in psychiatric clinic by Dr. \nSeal. \nEx. DR-12 at 1-2 [Record Document 718-8]. Although Hayden’s mental health progress \nnote purports to describe events that he witnessed before the chemical agent was deployed, \nthe video shows that Hayden did not arrive to speak with J.G. until after the chemical agent \nwas deployed. Ex. PR-D-33 at 01:52.  \n163 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 754   Filed 07/18/24   Page 166 of 172 PageID #: \n55326\nThere is no documentation of any medical or mental health evaluation before J.G. \nis placed on suicide watch. He had an appointment with Dr. Seal two days later, but Dr. \nSeal’s notes are illegible. Id. at 3. J.G. was subsequently transferred to EHCC for treatment, \nhis condition requiring mental health resources beyond those available at DWCC. Seal \nRemedy Trial Tr. vol. IX at 1993:12-17.  \nJ.G. did not pose a security threat to the officers, himself, or his fellow inmates. \nInstead, it was clear to even a lay person that he was suffering from a mental health episode \nand was unable to function and care for himself. This is confirmed by the ultimate decision \nto transfer J.G. to EHCC for treatment. However, instead of calling a mental health \nclinician,  he  was  pepper  sprayed  and  placed  on  suicide  watch.  This  one  incident  is \nillustrative of the disconnect between security and mental health staff. It also typifies the \nsystemic practice that the Court saw throughout the trial: that an inmate’s mental health is \nnot considered before disciplining or employing force against him.  \nAccordingly, Plaintiffs met their burden in proving that DWCC continues to violate \nthe ADA and RA with respect to accommodations to the disciplinary processes and will \ncontinue to violate the ADA and RA in this manner into the future.69  \nC. Methods of Administration \nIn its liability phase opinion, the Court held that Plaintiffs were able to prove that \nDefendants violated the ADA by utilizing methods of administration that had the effect of \ndiscriminating against disabled inmates. Record Document 641 at 137-145. Specifically, \n \n69 For individuals in confinement, these inappropriate disciplinary practices also rise to the \nlevel of a constitutional violation.  \n164 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 754   Filed 07/18/24   Page 167 of 172 PageID #: \n55327\nthe Court found that DWCC violates the ADA by using an under-inclusive definition of \nserious mental illness and by failing to maintain an adequate system for inmates to request \nand obtain reasonable accommodations regarding mental illness.70 Id. at 144-145. The \nADA also recognizes a “methods of administration” claim that prohibits public entities \nfrom using “criteria or methods of administration . . . [that] have the effect of subjecting \nqualified individuals with disabilities to discrimination on the basis of disability.” 28 \nC.F.R. § 35.130(b)(3); see Dunn v. Dunn, 318 F.R.D. 652, 664 (M.D. Ala. 2016). \nA public entity may not . . . utilize criteria or methods of administration . . . \n[t]hat have the effect of subjecting qualified individuals with disabilities to \ndiscrimination on the basis of disability . . . [or] [t]hat have the purpose or \neffect  of  defeating  or  substantially  impairing  accomplishment  of  the \nobjectives of the public entity’s program with respect to individuals with \ndisabilities. \n28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(3)(i) & (ii). “In other words, a public entity cannot actively undercut \nthe ability of a public program to benefit those with disabilities.” Van Velzor v. City of \nBurleson,  43  F.  Supp.  3d  746,  752  (N.D.  Tex.  2014).  “[A]n  omission  as  well  as  a \ncommission can be an actionable method of administration.” Dunn, 318 F.R.D. at 665. \n“The methods-of-administration regulation makes clear that a know-nothing, do-nothing \npolicy of non-administration is a privately actionable violation of the ADA, at least when \n \n70 The Court did not find that Plaintiffs were able to meet their burden with respect to a \nthird claim—that DWCC violates the ADA by failing to identify and track inmates with a \nserious mental illness but who are in remission. Id. at 141-42. The Court found that \nPlaintiff’s only example of an inmate who lost his serious mental illness designation \nbecause he was in a period of remission was not sufficient to prove that a widespread \nviolation  of  the  ADA  and  RA  exists.  As  such,  Plaintiffs’  claim  as  to  that  issue  is \nDISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE. The Court points out that inmates in remission are \ndifferent than chronic illness, which is addressed previously in this opinion.  \n165 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 754   Filed 07/18/24   Page 168 of 172 PageID #: \n55328\nplaintiffs can show that it has the effect of discriminating.” Id. at 665 n.12. Under the ADA, \nprisons must be “proactive.” Id.  \n  The  Court  will  address  below  whether  Defendants  have  remedied  the  under-\ninclusive definition of serious mental illness and the failure to maintain an adequate system \nby which inmates may request accommodations regarding mental illness. \ni.  Under-inclusive Definition of Serious Mental Illness \nDuring the liability phase, the Court held that the DOC utilizes an under-inclusive \ndefinition of disability “by excluding inmates with debilitating mental illnesses by way of \nfunctional impairment from the definition of serious illness.” Record Document 641 at 141. \nIn so doing, the Court determined that there was a “substantial likelihood that inmates with \nserious mental illnesses by way of functional impairment will fall through the cracks and \nwill not be treated accordingly,” which in turn could result in these inmates not being \nprovided with adequate mental health care or appropriate accommodations. Id. The Court \nthus found that Defendants violated the ADA and RA by adopting this under-inclusive \ndefinition of serious mental illness.  \nDefendants did not provide the Court with any evidence that this definition has \nchanged since the liability phase of trial. Plaintiffs, conversely, were able to prove that this \ndefinition has not changed since the liability phase of trial. As Dr. Burns testified, the \nDOC’s definition of serious mental illness (“SMI”) had not changed since March 2020 and \nwas inclusive of only the six same diagnoses previously identified. Burns Remedy Trial \nTr. vol. VII at 1539:9-15 [Record Document 710]. Those six diagnoses were: major \ndepressive disorder, schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, bipolar disorder, unspecified \n166 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 754   Filed 07/18/24   Page 169 of 172 PageID #: \n55329\nschizophrenia spectrum, and severe anxiety disorder. Ex. P-JJJ-25 at 2 [Record Document \n564-204].  \nAccordingly, the Court finds that Plaintiffs met their burden in proving that DWCC \ncontinues to violate the ADA and RA with respect to its under-inclusive definition of \nserious mental illness and will continue to violate the ADA and RA in this manner into the \nfuture.  \nii.  Inadequate Process for Requesting Reasonable Accommodations \nDuring the liability phase of trial, the Court found there to be systemic deficiencies \n“in the ways that DWCC identifies, screens, and tracks ADA requests.” Record Document \n641 at 144. Under the ADA, “employing no system or an inadequate system for prisoners \nto request accommodations and submit grievances regarding non-accommodation” can be \nan unlawful method of administration. Dunn, 318 F.R.D. at 665; see Lewis, 2021 WL \n1219988, at *48-50, 52; Armstrong v. Brown, 857 F. Supp. 2d 919, 933 (N.D. Cal. 2012) \n(finding a violation of the ADA because the county jail lacked “functional and timely \ngrievance procedures . . . to request and obtain disability accommodations”).  \nFirst, the Court found that Deputy Warden Huff—who preceded Assistant Warden \nAcklin—failed to document any ADA interviews that she had with an inmate who utilized \nthe ARP process. Record Document 641 at 142-143. Additionally, only those complaints \nspecifically labeled “ADA complaints” or specifically using the magic words “a request \nfor accommodations” were reviewed by Deputy Warden Huff. Id. at 143. In the preceding \nfive years, she could not recall ever granting a request for accommodations or even \nreviewing a request for accommodations based on mental illness. Id.  \n167 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 754   Filed 07/18/24   Page 170 of 172 PageID #: \n55330\nAccording to Assistant Warden Acklin, the process by which an inmate can request \nan accommodation has not materially changed since the liability phase of trial. Ex. PR-BB-\n1 at 14:20-15:7 [Record Document 714-1]. Assistant Warden Acklin has never distributed \ninformation to inmates on the South Compound regarding the process by which they can \nseek accommodations. Id. at 16:1-8. She testified that intake is the only time an inmate is \ninformed of the process by which he may make a request for a reasonable accommodation. \nId. at 16:9-17. However, Defendants did not provide any evidence to support their assertion \nthat these conversations actually take place. Id. Despite being the ADA Coordinator, \nAssistant Warden Acklin showed a surprising lack of knowledge of her job responsibilities. \nFor example, she testified that she did not provide inmates with any information about \nreasonable accommodations upon intake and was unable to identify the DWCC staff \nmember responsible for doing so. Id. at 17:7-15. She could not enunciate  how it is \ndetermined that an ARP contains a request for a reasonable accommodation. Id. 17:24-\n18:9. She was unaware of any list kept by DWCC tracking the inmates diagnosed with a \ndisability  or  those  who  may  qualify  for  reasonable  accommodations.  Id.  at  23:8-16. \nAssistant Warden Acklin was also unable to articulate whether an inmate needed to be \ndiagnosed with a mental illness to receive reasonable accommodations, a process that is \noutlined in Department Regulation IS-B-4. Assistant Warden Acklin testified that since \nMarch  2020,  she  had  not  approved  even  one  prisoner’s  request  for  a  reasonable \naccommodation. Id. at 21:8-15.   \nAs is apparent from Assistant Warden Acklin’s testimony, DWCC has not remedied \nthe process for requesting reasonable accommodations. Her lack of knowledge about the \n168 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 754   Filed 07/18/24   Page 171 of 172 PageID #: \n55331\nprocess by which an inmate should request accommodations, as well as who would qualify \nfor reasonable accommodations, proves that there is no true system by which an inmate \ncan functionally and timely request accommodations for his disability. Accordingly, the \nCourt finds that Plaintiffs met their burden in proving that DWCC continues to violate the \nADA and RA with respect to its inadequate process for requesting accommodations and \nwill continue to violate the ADA and RA in this manner into the future.  \nD. Conclusion as to ADA and RA Claims \nIn conclusion, Plaintiffs met their burden in proving that there are widespread, \nsystemic violations of the ADA and RA that continue to occur and will continue to occur \ninto the future without the Court’s intervention. DWCC has not remedied its failure to \naccommodate inmates with mental illness before housing them on the South Compound or \nbefore employing force or using discipline against them. Moreover, DWCC violates the \nADA in its methods of administration through its adoption of an under-inclusive definition \nof mental illness and by failing to maintain and implement an adequate system by which \ninmates can request and receive reasonable accommodations for  their mental illness. \nDefendants failed to provide any evidence that they have remedied these deficiencies since \nthe liability phase of trial. Plaintiffs are entitled to injunctive relief to remedy the violations \nof their protections under the ADA and RA.   \nVII.  Conclusion \nFor  the  foregoing  reasons,  the  Court  holds  that  Defendants,  in  their  official \ncapacities, are violating the Eighth Amendment rights of the Class and the ADA and RA \nrights of the Subclass.  \n169 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 754   Filed 07/18/24   Page 172 of 172 PageID #: \n55332\nFor  the  reasons  previously  enunciated  by  the  Court,  Defendants  are  hereby \nENJOINED from the following: 1) continuing to violate the Eighth Amendment rights of \nall inmates in extended lockdown—the Class—through the unconstitutional conditions of \nconfinement and provision of deficient mental health services; and 2) continuing to violate \nthe  ADA  and  RA  rights  of  inmates  with  a  qualifying  mental  illness—the  Subclass. \nAdditionally, Defendants are ORDERED to remedy the constitutional and ADA and RA \nviolations as previously enumerated.   \nThe Court incorporates in this opinion the injunctive and declaratory relief outlined \nin the remedial order and filed in connection with this opinion [Record Document 755].  \nTHUS DONE AND SIGNED this 18th day of July, 2024. \nELIZABETH ERNY FOOTE \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE \n170 ",

Men at David Wade Correctional Center (hereinafter “DWCC”) are being held in \nextreme, abusive conditions.  They are held in prolonged solitary confinement or extended \nlockdown for months and years, often unable to go outside for weeks on end.  There is no \nexternal sensory stimulation—no television, no radio, and little human contact. Men held in these \nconditions are allowed to place one phone call per month to someone in the outside world.  \n2.  These  extreme  conditions  create  mental  illness,  and  exacerbate  pre-existing \nmental illness, causing psychotic decompensation and propensity for acts of self- harm. Some \n1 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 1   Filed 02/20/18   Page 2 of 53 PageID #:  2\npeople hear voices, or talk and scream to themselves. Some engage in cutting themselves and \nattempting suicide to escape the extreme conditions. Two men have sliced open their testicles \nand one attempted to cut off his ear. Another man climbed a barbed-wire fence and attempted \nsuicide by diving off headfirst. Others bang their heads against the walls. The people confined at \nDavid Wade are at immediate risk of harm without this Court’s intervention. \n3.  Prisoners are placed in extended lockdown, either in a double bunk cell or a more \nrestrictive solitary cell, without regard to whether they are already at risk for mental illness, \ndecompensation,  or  self-harm.    Once  on  extended  lockdown,  people  with  mental  illness \ndecompensate and symptoms become more severe. Staff then respond to symptoms of mental \nillness by using restraint chains on people in cells, chaining people to wooden restraint chairs, \nusing chemical spray on people in cells, issuing additional write-ups or criminal charges, taking \naway outdoor time, moving prisoners to more extreme isolation, and taking away all clothing, \nreading material, and mattresses as punishment.  \n4.  Virtually no mental health care is provided to prisoners on extended lockdown, \naside from scattershot, poorly administered and inconsistent medication. What minimal contact \nprisoners at David Wade have with a psychiatrist at the prison occurs once every three to six \nmonths, lasts less than ten minutes and is supervised by a security officer in the room. If \nprisoners at David Wade request mental health care they are placed on “suicide watch” which \nmeans that they are stripped of clothing and belongings, and held in a solitary confinement cell \non the disciplinary tier for weeks. Suicide watch is only provided on the disciplinary tiers. There \nis no lesser intervention provided and no otherwise functioning sick call or grievance system \navailable to seek mental health care.  \n2 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 1   Filed 02/20/18   Page 3 of 53 PageID #:  3\n5.  Plaintiffs bring this action for injunctive and declaratory relief to remedy the \ndestructive cycle imposed by Defendants in which prisoners suffer breakdowns due to untreated \nmental illness under harsh and brutal conditions, Defendants respond with punitive suicide watch \ninstead of treatment, Defendants ignore the worsening symptoms of mental illness, and then \nDefendants punish those who speak out or act out due to lack of treatment.  This cycle continues \nuntil the prisoner is either totally unable to care for himself and has to be transferred out of the \nprison into an acute care facility or is released on to the street.  This lawsuit seeks to enjoin the \nfailed  systems  that  deprive  prisoners  of  their  rights  to  humane,  civilized  conditions  of \nconfinement. \n6.  Plaintiffs Anthony Tellis and Bruce Charles, each an individual with a disability \nand prisoner of DWCC, bring this action under Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act \n(“ADA), 42 U.S.C. § 12131 et seq.; Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (Section 504), 29 \nU.S.C. § 794, and 42 U.S.C. § 1983 to remedy violations of the Eighth Amendment to the United \nStates Constitution.  \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n7.  Plaintiffs bring this action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and 42 U.S.C. § 12131 et \nseq., and 29 U.S.C. § 794. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § \n1331, § 1343, and § 2201. \n8.  Venue is proper in this district pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b), because many of \nthe events or omissions complained of occurred here, the Department of Public Safety and \nCorrections is headquartered here, and the Defendant Secretary resides here.  \n \n \n3 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 1   Filed 02/20/18   Page 4 of 53 PageID #:  4\nPARTIES \nA.   DEFENDANTS \n9.  Defendant James LeBlanc is the Secretary of the Louisiana Department of Public \nSafety and Corrections (“DPS&C”). Secretary LeBlanc is ultimately responsible for the control, \noversight, and functioning of all programs and facilities within the DPS&C, including David \nWade Correctional Center. He formulates, directs, and maintains all regulations of the DPS&C, \nand determines the DPS&C’s policies regarding management, personnel, and total operations. \nThis includes ultimate determination of facilities and conditions in which the DPS&C houses \npeople with mental illness. Defendant LeBlanc directs the DPS&C’s central office and field \nstaff,  which  are  charged  with  carrying  out  the  work  of  the  agency.  He  is  responsible  for \nprotecting the constitutional and statutory rights of all persons held by the DPS&C, including at \nDavid Wade Correctional Center.  Defendant LeBlanc is the final policymaker with regard to the \nconditions at DWCC. He has implemented or supported the implementation of the policies that \ncause harm to Plaintiffs, and has failed to implement additional policies that would prevent harm \nto Plaintiffs. He has oversight authority over DWCC, which he has failed to exercise to prevent \nharm to Plaintiffs.  At all times relevant to this Complaint he was acting under color of law and \nin his official capacity.  \n10.  Defendant Jerry Goodwin is the Warden over David Wade Correctional Center. \nHe is responsible for control over DWCC and makes all final staffing, budget, and administrative \ndecisions that are not otherwise made by Defendant LeBlanc. He is responsible for the safety and \ncare of all persons held at David Wade Correctional Center and is responsible for protecting and \nimplementing prisoners’ statutory and constitutional rights. He oversees disciplinary actions and \ndecisions, housing decisions, and the supervision of and care for people with serious mental \n4 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 1   Filed 02/20/18   Page 5 of 53 PageID #:  5\nillness. He personally sets and implements policies that cause the onset of mental illness, mental \ndecompensation, and harm to Plaintiffs. He is sued in his official capacity.   \n11.  Defendant Lonnie Nail is a Colonel at DWCC. Nail has final authority over \noperations of the “south side” of the facility, which houses the extended lockdown and solitary \nconfinement populations at DWCC, including Plaintiffs and the proposed class members. Upon \ninformation and belief he answers only to Defendants Warden Goodwin and Secretary LeBlanc. \nHe participates in and supervises disciplinary actions and decisions, staffing decisions, housing \ndecisions, and supervision of and care for people with serious mental illness. He personally sets \nand implements policies that cause harm to Plaintiffs, including causing decompensation and the \nonset of mental illness. He is sued in his official capacity.  \n12.  Defendant  Doctor  Gregory  Seal,  M.D.  is  a  contract  psychiatrist  at  DWCC. \nDefendant Seal fails to adequately treat and care for Plaintiffs and proposed class members. He \nimplements treatment and non-treatment decisions that cause mental deterioration and harm to \nPlaintiffs and proposed class members. He is sued in his official capacity.  \n13.  Defendant Assistant Warden Deborah Dauzat is the Mental Health Director at \nDWCC. She is a Licensed Clinical Social Worker and a Board Approved Clinical Supervisor. \nShe participates in hiring of mental health staff. Defendant Dauzat fails to adequately supervise \nthe mental health staff and oversee treatment planning. Defendant Dauzat fails to ensure that \nmental health services and programs are adequate to address the serious needs of Plaintiffs and \nproposed  class  members.  She  implements  treatment  and  non-treatment  decisions  that  cause \nmental deterioration and harm to Plaintiffs and proposed class members. She is sued in her \nofficial capacity.  \n5 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 1   Filed 02/20/18   Page 6 of 53 PageID #:  6\n14.  Defendant Steve Hayden is a Corrections Program Manager 2 at DWCC. He \nholds a Master’s Degree in Industrial Psychology. Defendant Hayden fails to adequately treat \nand care for Plaintiffs and proposed class members, and provides clinical care without being \nlicensed to do so. He implements treatment and non-treatment decisions that cause mental \ndeterioration and harm to Plaintiffs and proposed class members. He is sued in his official \ncapacity.  \n15.  Defendant Aerial Robinson is a Social Services Counselor 1 at DWCC. She \nimplements treatment and non-treatment decisions that cause mental deterioration and harm to \nPlaintiffs  and  proposed  class  members.  Defendant  Robinson  is  a  Licensed  Clinical  Social \nWorker. Defendant Robinson fails to adequately treat and care for Plaintiffs and proposed class \nmembers. She is sued in her official capacity.  \n16.  Defendant Johnie Adkins is employed by DWCC as a Social Services Counselor \nI. In that capacity, he conducts interviews with inmates on suicide watch, conducts PREA \ninterviews following a sexual assault, and informs inmates of the passing of relatives. He fails to \nadequately treat and care for Plaintiffs and proposed class members. He provides clinical care \nwithout being licensed to do so, and his decisions cause harm to Plaintiffs and proposed class \nmembers. He is sued in his official capacity.  \n17.  The  Department  of  Public  Safety  and  Corrections  (“DPS&C”)  is  the \nadministrative arm of the State of Louisiana responsible for administering the state’s correctional \nfacilities, including DWCC where Plaintiffs are incarcerated. The DPS&C is an instrumentality \nof the State of Louisiana. The DPS&C is responsible for each of the actions and inactions \ncomplained of herein. The DPS&C is a recipient of federal funding. The DPS&C as an entity is \nsued pursuant to the ADA and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act only.  \n6 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 1   Filed 02/20/18   Page 7 of 53 PageID #:  7\nB.   PLAINTIFFS  \n18.  Plaintiff Anthony Tellis is a prisoner housed in extended lockdown at DWCC.  \nMr. Tellis first came into DWCC custody in 2008 and has been on extended lockdown since \nFebruary 2016.  He was not diagnosed with a mental illness prior to being incarcerated, but has \nsince developed mental illness.  Mr. Tellis is a person with a disability as defined in 42 U.S.C. § \n12102 and 29 U.S.C. § 705(9).  Mr. Tellis is being exposed to inhumane conditions in violation \nof the Eighth Amendment.  He is also being denied adequate mental health treatment and \nreasonable accommodations for his disabilities under the Americans with Disabilities Act and § \n504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.  Mr. Tellis is a representative of the putative class and \nsubclass. \n19.  Plaintiff Bruce Charles is a prisoner housed in extended lockdown at DWCC.  Mr. \nCharles has been in DWCC custody since June 2016 and has been housed on extended lockdown \nsince then.  He was diagnosed with bipolar disorder prior to his incarceration and that diagnosis \nwas recognized during his placement at the Dixon, Hunt, and Allen state correctional facilities \nprior to his transfer to DWCC.  Mr. Charles is a person with a disability as defined in 42 U.S.C. \n§ 12102 and 29 U.S.C. § 705(9).  Mr. Charles is being exposed to inhumane conditions in \nviolation of the Eighth Amendment.  He is also being denied adequate mental health treatment \nand reasonable accommodations for his disabilities under the Americans with Disabilities Act \nand § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.  Mr. Charles is a representative of the putative class \nas well as the subclass. \n20.  Plaintiffs bring this action under 42 U.S.C. §1983, for violations of the First and \nEighth Amendments to the United States Constitution on behalf of all prisoners currently held, or \n7 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 1   Filed 02/20/18   Page 8 of 53 PageID #:  8\nwho will in the future be held, in extended lockdown at DWCC in the N-1, N-2, N-3, and N-4 \nbuildings. \n21.  Plaintiffs also bring this action under the ADA and Section 504 on behalf of a \nsub-class consisting of all individuals on extended lockdown at David Wade Correctional Center \nwho have or are perceived as having a qualifying disability related to mental health, as defined \nwithin the Americans with Disabilities Act. This sub-class includes all individuals who develop \nsuch a mental illness during the duration of time they are incarcerated in extended lockdown. On \nbehalf of the sub-class, Plaintiffs advance claims pursuant to the First and Eighth Amendments \nas well as the ADA and Section 504.  \n \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \nA. The Physical Plant of Lockdown Units at David Wade Correctional Center \n \n22.  David  Wade  Correctional  Center  is  divided  into  two  compounds:  the  North \nCompound and the South Compound. The South Compound is comprised of five buildings, N-1 \nthrough N-5.    \n23.  The abuses complained of herein occur at the South Compound of the prison, \nbuildings N-1 through N-4, which are solitary confinement and extended lockdown tiers.1  \n24.  For the purposes of the litigation, extended lockdown refers to the confinement in \na cell for 23 to 24 hours per day. Solitary confinement refers to the subset of extended lockdown \nin which a single prisoner is confined alone in a cell with no regular social interaction for 23 to \n24 hours per day. \n                                                 \n1 N-5 is not subject of this litigation as it houses high-profile prisoners in different conditions than the other \nbuildings. \n8 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 1   Filed 02/20/18   Page 9 of 53 PageID #:  9\n25.  Each lockdown building has four linear tiers: A, B, C, and D. The tiers each have \n16 cells. These cells may used as double-man cells, except in the N-4 building, which is the \nsolitary confinement building.  \n26.  Of the 16 cells on each tier in N-4, the first two cells are reserved for individuals \nwho are on suicide watch. There is a camera in each of those cells, as well as in all cells on the \nN-4 C tier.  \n27.  The buildings are not consistently climate controlled. There is no air conditioning. \nFans were installed approximately a year ago. In the summer the cells are very hot, and in the \nwinter they are cold.  \nB.  Conditions in the David Wade Lockdown Units are Brutal and Inhumane. \n28.  All prisoners who are transferred to DWCC are housed in lockdown for a period \nof time prior to being moved to general population. The lockdown units also are used for any \nprisoner in general population who is suicidal or attempts suicide. Finally, the units are used for \nthe disciplinary population: prisoners who have committed a rule violation in general population \nmay be administratively sentenced to serve time in the lockdown buildings.  \n29.  On extended lockdown, individuals are allowed outside for fifty-five minutes per \nday Monday through Friday, unless they are on “yard restriction.” If on yard restriction, one is \nallowed outside for fifty-five minutes on Saturdays and Sundays. Many people are on yard \nrestriction for months or years on end.  Mr. Charles has been on yard restriction for nearly two \nyears. \n30.  People on extended lockdown get one ten-minute phone call per month. That \nphone call is not at a regularly scheduled time and thus there is no way to plan for a family \nmember to be available for the phone call. Staff may refuse a prisoner’s phone call without \n9 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 1   Filed 02/20/18   Page 10 of 53 PageID #:  10\ngiving any reason.  Staff will often refuse the call as retaliation against the individual requesting \nthe call.  Individuals on extended lockdown are unable to make attorney phone calls.   \n31.  Extended lockdown prisoners are not brought for a shower every day. Staff barter \nadditional food in exchange for prisoners waiving their shower time, do not wake sleeping \nprisoners for their showers, or simply ignore the prisoner and record the shower as having been \nwaived. \n32.  Prisoners on extended lockdown are allowed three books. There is no radio, \ntelevision, educational program, self-help program, or any other external stimuli on the tier. \nPrisoners who are not literate or who have become incapable of reading due to mental illness \nhave nothing to occupy their minds on extended lockdown.  \n33.  Prisoners cannot see one another as the cells face concrete walls and the outer \nwindows.  \n34.  Interactions between prisoners are forbidden by the written policy of DWCC, and \nthey may receive a disciplinary write-up for attempting to communicate with one another. \n35.  Prisoners on extended lockdown, especially those in solitary confinement, are \nallowed very little human contact.   \n36.  Most of the individuals serving disciplinary time on the lockdown units have been \ndiagnosed with one or more mental illnesses. Due to the lack of human contact and uncontrolled \nmental  illness,  many  will  scream,  laugh,  and  talk  to  themselves.  Others  rock  in  place  or \ndeteriorate to more severe manifestations of their conditions, such as smearing blood or feces. \nSome are unable to communicate at all.  \n10 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 1   Filed 02/20/18   Page 11 of 53 PageID #:  11\n37.  Prisoners who suffer a major psychiatric episode frequently lose the ability to take \ncare of themselves for the duration of such an episode. When a prisoner in extended lockdown is \nunable to care for himself, he may go weeks or months without a shower.  \n38.  Defendants maintain a policy styled “Offender Posted Policy 34(S),” hereinafter \n“Policy 34,” or “strip cell.” This policy permits staff to strip a prisoner of all belongings, \nincluding his mattress, in response to a perceived rule violation.  \n39.  Policy 34 is independent of any formal disciplinary sentence. It is deployed at \nstaff discretion with no due process protections or hearings. The absence of any procedural \nsafeguards means that a staff member who becomes upset with a prisoner may simply put the \nprisoner on Policy 34 without any showing that the prisoner has violated any institutional rules. \n40.  On Policy 34, prisoners are not allowed a mattress outside of the hours of 9pm to \n5am. Although the policy calls for mattresses to be returned at 9pm, they are frequently not \nreturned timely or at all. Prisoners will be housed this way for thirty days or more, at the whim of \nthe ranking correctional officers. This status is strictly punitive.  \n41.  If a prisoner on lockdown requests mental health care, he will usually be placed \non suicide watch.  \n42.  DWCC has two categories of suicide watch, standard and extreme.   \n43.  Prisoners on standard suicide watch are clothed only in a short paper gown.  The \nprisoner has no access to any property, including mattresses, letters, or books. He can only stand \nor sit in his cell on the concrete in a short paper gown. \n44.  On extreme suicide watch, the suicidal prisoner is housed in a paper gown without \naccess to property, but is additionally placed in restraints while in a cell alone.  Those restraints \nmay be: (1) four-point restraints, which consist of both hands being cuffed with the chain for the \n11 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 1   Filed 02/20/18   Page 12 of 53 PageID #:  12\ncuffs connected to a box to prevent movement or tampering, a belly chain connected to the \nhandcuff chain, and shackles on the ankles, (2) chaining a person to a restraint chair, which \nattaches each limb to the chair, or (3) the restraint chair with a helmet to prevent spitting and \nhead banging. DWCC staff sometimes restrain prisoners in this chair for days at a time, and often \nuse the chair rather than providing actual mental health care. \n45.  DWCC staff engage in targeted punishment of suicidal prisoners. Defendants \nrefuse to allow prisoners on suicide watch to visit with relatives or use the telephone to access \nany  source  of  outside  emotional  support.  Although  the  facility  possesses  suicide  resistant \nmattresses, those mattresses are often not given to prisoners on suicide watch, who must stand \nand sleep on the concrete. \n46.  In the winter, prisoners’ cells can be extremely cold. Prisoners uniformly report \nthat sometimes staff open windows near the suicide watch cells to make conditions even colder. \nBecause they do not have shoes or mattresses people must stand barefoot on concrete in a small \npaper gown.  \n47.  Eleven independent prisoners’ accounts confirmed that windows were left open \nlate December of 2017 and early January of 2018, including January 2, 2018, when temperatures \nin Homer, Louisiana reached a low of 14 degrees Fahrenheit. The use of extreme cold to punish \nbehavior on the tier is not a single isolated incident and occurs so frequently that prisoners have a \nword for it, “bluesing” or “getting bluesed.” \n48.  When a prisoner in extended lockdown decides to self-report a mental health \nneed, one must prepare to spend days and likely weeks without clothing, on a concrete floor, \nwithout a mattress, and without access to any property. Individuals are held in these conditions \n12 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 1   Filed 02/20/18   Page 13 of 53 PageID #:  13\nfor days or weeks at a time, irrespective of the actual risk of harm, whether other treatment \nmethods would be effective, and even once the threat of self-harm has subsided.  \n49.  These conditions function as a deterrent to requesting any mental health care at \nall.  Confining  Plaintiffs  to  suicide  watch  as  a  general  response  to  mental  health  concerns \nsignificantly chills willingness to report signs and symptoms of mental illness to staff. \n50.  The extreme isolation, deprivation of stimuli, severe punishments, and acts of \ntorture all work to create a significant risk of harm to the mental health of the people housed at \nDWCC.  \nC. Defendants Fail to Provide Adequate Mental Health Care and Are Deliberately \nIndifferent to Prisoners’ Mental Health Needs. \n \n51.  Defendants fail to provide any meaningful access to mental health care to the \nprisoners on extended lockdown. First, Defendants fail to identify prisoners with serious mental \nillness and consistently understate the severity of mental illness where it is identified. Second, \neven when an individual with mental illness is identified, every prisoner receives the same \ntreatment plan that calls for nothing except medication management. Third, when the inadequate \ntreatment causes a prisoner to decompensate, the only means Defendants employ to stabilize a \npatient  is  to  simply  place  the  prisoner  on  suicide  watch.  Fourth,  Defendants’  failure  to \nadequately staff the mental health program at the prison contributes to each of these problems.  \n52.  Each of these failed policies put prisoners at severe risk of mental illness and \nphysical harm. As outlined in Part C of this Complaint, these policies have caused actual harm to \neach named Plaintiff and to others housed at DWCC. Defendants act with deliberate indifference \nto these risks. \n \n13 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 1   Filed 02/20/18   Page 14 of 53 PageID #:  14\na.  Defendants’ Inadequate Mental Health Screening Places Prisoners at Risk of  \n    Serious Harm. \n \n53.  Mental health screening at DWCC is a failure at every juncture, including during \nintake, regular screening, and in response to crisis and suicide watch. Where screenings do occur, \nthe inadequacy of the process results in under-diagnoses of serious mental illness. \n54.  Defendants’  failure  to  identify  prisoners  with  serious  mental  illness  exposes \nprisoners  to  significant  risks  of  mental  and  physical  harm  and  deprives  prisoners  of  the \nopportunity to receive needed treatment. \n \n  i.  Defendants Place Prisoners on Extended Lockdown Without Adequate \n      Screening.  \n \n55.  Proper mental health screening is critical to the safety of prisoners.  \n56.  Prisoners sentenced to the DPS&C are often initially assessed at Elayn Hunt \nCorrectional Center (“EHCC”) before being assigned to a specific DPS&C facility for housing. \nEHCC has reception and diagnostic capacities, has a psychiatrist on staff, and has a special \nhousing unit for individuals with severe mental health needs.  \n57.  If a prisoner is placed by DPS&C at DWCC, David Wade staff then perform a \nmental health screening. Inexplicably, these assessments do not take into account the person’s \ninitial DPS&C evaluation or their DPS&C records. These screenings are cursory, unhelpful, and \nproduce results that are plainly contrary to facts already in the DPS&C’s own records. \n58.  The mental health screening is typically performed by Steve Hayden, who is not a \npsychiatrist, psychologist, social worker, or counselor.  \n59.  Prisoners known to the Defendants to have serious mental illnesses, including \nextensive histories of suicidal ideation and behavior, are routinely placed on extended lockdown \nat DWCC.  \n14 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 1   Filed 02/20/18   Page 15 of 53 PageID #:  15\n60.  Placement on extended lockdown further exposes a prisoner with serious mental \nillness  to  significant  risk  of  self-harm.  Defendants’  screening  mechanisms  disregard  the \ninformation available in the prisoners’ mental health records. \n61.  Likewise, when a prisoner is placed on extended lockdown for a disciplinary \nreason, Defendants do not conduct any review of records to identify whether the prisoner has a \nmental health diagnosis that would require treatment or care inconsistent with the extreme \nisolation of solitary confinement or extended lockdown. \n  ii.  Defendants Fail to Conduct Regular Screening for Mental Illness    \n      in Extended Lockdown. \n \n62.  The absence of observation and monitoring of individuals on extended lockdown \nmeans that psychiatric decompensation goes unnoticed, as does the onset of new symptoms. \n63.  Staff  at  DWCC  conduct  segregation  interviews  for  prisoners  in  extended \nlockdown approximately every 90 days. These interviews are conducted primarily by Defendant \nHayden and Defendant Robinson.  \n64.  The  segregation  interviews  that  are  conducted  are  cursory  and  diagnostically \nunhelpful.  The documentation produced as a result of a routine segregation interview will nearly \nuniversally indicate that the prisoner is “within normal limits” in all areas, even for prisoners \nwith serious mental health diagnoses. Interviews also usually indicate that the prisoner engaged \nin minimal conversation. \n65.  Signs and symptoms of serious mental illness remain unidentified or untreated \nand prisoners experiencing crisis manifestations of mental illness are not detected before the \nperson is a significant risk to himself or others. Plaintiffs Charles and Tellis have been harmed \nby the absence of ongoing screening for mental illness while on extended lockdown because they \nhave not been assessed for changes to their condition despite new and worsening symptoms. \n15 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 1   Filed 02/20/18   Page 16 of 53 PageID #:  16\n  iii.  Defendants Do Not Conduct Mental Health Screening in Response  \n      to Mental Health Crisis Situations. \n \n66.  Defendants do not respond to evidence of mental health crisis with any system of \nassessments, diagnostics, counseling, or treatment. \n67.  Defendants do not conduct screenings or make mental health resources available \nto prisoners with a pattern of suicidal ideation, even in the face of repeated mental health crises.  \n68.  Upon release from suicide watch, Defendants’ policy only calls for one follow-up \ninterview, to be conducted one week after the prisoner is taken off suicide watch. The follow-up \ninterview uses the same format as the “Segregation Interview” and does not call for any further \nmental health evaluations or services. \n69.  Other manifestations of illness that fall short of self-harm or suicidal ideation are \ntreated  as  disciplinary  violations  and  produce  no  mental  health  treatment  or  follow-up. \nDefendants  respond  to  yelling,  cursing,  refusing  to  move,  and  other  behavior  potentially \ndiagnostic  of  untreated  mental  illness  as  a  disciplinary  matter  rather  than  a  mental  health \nsymptom. \n70.  The  failure  of  DWCC’s  system  of  intake,  diagnosis,  and  routine  evaluation \nexposes all prisoners to the real risk that a mental illness will be left undiagnosed and untreated.  \nb.  Defendants Provide Inadequate Mental Health Treatment to Prisoners on  \n    Extended Lockdown. \n \n71.  Prisoners on extended lockdown receive virtually no treatment for mental illness. \nThere is no counseling, group therapy, or support group, regardless of an individual’s diagnosis \nor response to medication. \n72.  Prisoners  on  lockdown  in  DWCC  only  have  contact  with  a  contracting \npsychiatrist, Defendant Seal, every three months.  These visits last approximately 3-5 minutes.  \n16 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 1   Filed 02/20/18   Page 17 of 53 PageID #:  17\nA security officer is present in the room at every visit, and thus, if the patient wants to seek \nmental health care related to treatment by security staff, there is no confidentiality or privacy.  \nThese visits lack indicia of either diagnostic or psychotherapeutic purpose due to their short \nduration, infrequency, and lack of confidentiality. Defendant Seal’s signature does not appear on \nany  treatment  plans.  Defendant  Seal  never  prescribes  counseling,  group  therapy,  or  any \nintervention whatsoever other than medication. \n73.  Defendant Seal is retained by DWCC to provide these medication management \nvisits to prisoners.  Defendant Seal provides no other mental health services to prisoners in \nsolitary or lockdown. \n74.  In the event that a prisoner does not receive a prescription for any medication \nfrom Defendant Seal, that individual receives no mental health treatment plan whatsoever.  \n75.  Treatment for many mental health conditions requires more than just medication. \nThe chemical elements of treatment cannot replace therapy and counseling services to assist \npatients in coping with their mental illnesses. \n76.  All treatment plans for prisoners in solitary or extended lockdown at DWCC are \nsubstantively identical. \n77.  This generalized treatment plan that Defendants use to treat all Plaintiffs has no \nvalue. The treatment plan is the same regardless of diagnosis, treatment history, medication \nregimen, and all other individual circumstances.  \n78.  The long-term treatment goals in the treatment plans for everyone on extended \nlockdown are: “Long term treatment goals: 1. Maintain compliance with all institutional rules \nand regulations. 2. Maintain appropriate level of functioning. 3. Increase insight in order to be \nmoved to a less restrictive environment. Date Met: on-going.” \n17 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 1   Filed 02/20/18   Page 18 of 53 PageID #:  18\n79.  The  short-term  objectives  in  the  treatment  plans  for  everyone  on  extended \nlockdown are: “Short Term Objectives: Comply with medications prescribed and advise staff of \nany adverse effects, Identify stressors that create behaviors warranting segregation, Consistently \ndisplay appropriate behavior in accordance to institutional regulations.” \n80.  The treatment methods in the treatment plans for everyone on extended lockdown \nare absent. Each form cryptically states: “Treatment Methods: on-going.”  \n81.  The plans are also completely devoid of any required actions on the part of \nDWCC to provide any monitoring, counseling, or therapy, regardless of any patient’s medical \nhistory, diagnosis, or circumstances.  \n82.  The  Defendants’  treatment  plan  template  indicates  that  a  mechanism  for \nachievement should be coded beside each short-term goal, identifying how Defendants will help \nthe individual to achieve each identified goal. No treatment method codes are ever displayed and \nthere is never any narrative explanation of a treatment method. \n83.  Defendant Steve Hayden signed mental health treatment plans for both named \nPlaintiffs identifying himself as a “therapist.” Mr. Hayden is in fact not licensed by the State of \nLouisiana to provide mental health care in any capacity.  \n84.  The mental health treatment forms are also signed as “Reviewed by Michele \nDauzat, Assist. Warden, LCSW.” Assistant Warden Dauzat did not have any contact with the \nPlaintiffs in the formulation of their treatment plans. She almost never interacts with patients on \nthe lockdown units at DWCC, yet she approves their treatment plans. These plans are non-\nindividualized  and  do  not  reflect  any  individual  assessment  by  a  qualified  psychological \nprofessional.  \n18 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 1   Filed 02/20/18   Page 19 of 53 PageID #:  19\n85.  Plaintiff  Anthony  Tellis  received  a  mental  health  treatment  plan  exactly  as \ndescribed above on April 22, 2016, September 22, 2016, and January 5, 2017.  \n86.  Plaintiff  Bruce  Charles  received  a  mental  health  treatment  plan  exactly  as \ndescribed above on June 9, 2016. \n87.  Mental health care at DWCC consists exclusively of haphazard medication and \nrelegation to restrictive conditions of confinement. When a prisoner has a crisis manifestation of \na mental illness there are no interventions available other than suicide watch. The cursory \ntreatment plans reflect the complete absence of any other interventions.  \nc.  Defendants Deprive Prisoners of Needed Medications. \n88.  Upon transfer to DWCC, Defendants do not continue the medications that were \nbeing  prescribed  and  administered  in  the  facilities  where  the  prisoners  were  confined \nimmediately prior to the transfer.  As a result, a prisoner often waits weeks without necessary \nmedication, until he meets with Defendant Seal, receives a new prescription, and is integrated \ninto the medication distribution rotation. \n89.  Interruptions to mental health medications can trigger behavioral problems or \ncause additional symptoms in the patient’s underlying mental health condition. \n90.  Individuals who refuse medications are diagnosed as “in remission” despite a lack \nof review by a psychiatrist to determine whether the change in medication is appropriate.  \n91.  The record-keeping practices at DWCC are unreliable and dangerous.  Diagnoses \nshift without explanation.  Defendants discontinue or alter drug regimens with little paper trail.   \n92.  Defendant Seal’s clinical notes often indicate that a prisoner has stopped taking \nthe prescribed medication of their own accord. However, Defendant Seal’s clinical notes are \n19 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 1   Filed 02/20/18   Page 20 of 53 PageID #:  20\noften inconsistent with the medication distribution notes, which do not contain documentation of \nrefused medication. \n93.  When  prisoners  do  refuse  psychotropic  medications,  such  refusal  is  rarely \nproperly  documented.  Refusal  does  not  prompt  any  notification  to  a  psychiatrist  or  actual \nmedical  staff,  despite  possible  mental  and  physical  side  effects  of  suddenly  discontinuing \npsychotropic medications.  \n94.  This  failure  to  document  is  despite  the  fact  that  “comply  with  medications \nprescribed” is a goal on all generic treatment plans for prisoners in extended lockdown. \n95.  Mental health staff at DWCC frequently make decisions that are inconsistent with \nindividual health concerns that are clearly apparent in their own records. For example, there is no \nprocess  for  identifying  which  prisoners  are  on  medication  regimens  that  cannot  safely  be \nterminated without a step-down process. \nd.    Defendants Utilize Suicide Watch and Isolation as Substitutes for    \n    Necessary Mental Health Treatment  \n \n96.  There is no mental health treatment unit at David Wade Correctional Center.  \n97.  Due to the lack of general mental health screening and treatment by qualified \nstaff, Defendants use isolation and suicide watch as a response to any urgent request for mental \nhealth services, even if the request does not express suicidal ideation or threats of self-harm.   \n98.  Defendants’ notes from cell-front visits indicate that staff visits to people being \nheld on suicide watch are purely to determine whether the individual remains a threat to himself.  \nThe conversations are short and do not include any attempt to ascertain whether the individual is \nsuffering from worsening mental illness or is experiencing a crisis manifestation of a chronic \nmental illness.  \n20 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 1   Filed 02/20/18   Page 21 of 53 PageID #:  21\n99.  The underlying mental illness causing the self-harm risk is not addressed, due to \nthe complete lack of other mental health treatment and screening.  This often results in prisoners \nreturning to suicide watch multiple times.   \n100.  The harsh conditions of suicide watch and lack of treatment trigger psychiatric \ndeterioration and decompensation of prisoners.  People become trapped in a cycle of suicidal \nthoughts  and  self-harm,  deterioration  in  the  harsh  conditions  of  suicide  watch,  and  new \nbehavioral incidents caused by untreated mental illness. This results in additional disciplinary \nand self-harm actions. This cycle goes on ad infinitum. It prevents people from ever regaining \ntheir mental stability or leaving the disciplinary unit at the prison.  \n101.  Once they request urgent or crisis mental health care, prisoners are usually forced \nonto suicide watch as the only available intervention. If the prisoner refuses suicide watch and \nrequests other care, he may face a disciplinary charge of malingering.  The result is that many \npeople will remain quiet and silently suffer as mental health symptoms worsen to avoid choosing \nbetween the harsh conditions on suicide watch or a disciplinary charge.  \n102.  The putative Class members all face a risk of being subjected to the Defendants’ \npunitive,  non-therapeutic  policies  and  practices  pertaining  to  suicide  watch.    Given  the \nprevalence of under-diagnosed and untreated serious mental illness at DWCC, every prisoner \nhoused on the South Compound is at significant risk of being trapped in an ever-deepening cycle \nof untreated mental illness, crisis manifestations of the chronic mental illness, escalating crises, \nand housing on suicide watch. \ne.  Defendants Maintain Inadequate Mental Health Staffing  \n103.  Mental health services at DWCC are abysmally inadequate. There is one contract \npsychiatrist, Defendant Seal.  He only sees patients every ninety days—in the presence of \n21 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 1   Filed 02/20/18   Page 22 of 53 PageID #:  22\nsecurity staff-- for medication management. Prisoners are unable to otherwise request visits with \nhim.  \n104.  Unlicensed DWCC staff make mental health treatment and housing decisions \nbased upon cursory, uninformed, or limited interaction with prisoners.  \n105.  Defendant Steve Hayden is unqualified and unlicensed to provide mental health \ncare yet he makes most day-to-day decisions about care.  When he does walk-through the \nextended lockdown facilities, he does not provide any counseling services.  \n106.  Assistant Warden Michelle Dauzat is responsible for the mental health program at \nDWCC.    Warden  Dauzat  does  not  regularly  meet  with  prisoners  in  extended  lockdown.  \nHowever, she signs off on paperwork for individuals on extended lockdown without having ever \nseen her putative patients. \nD.  Defendants’ Lack of Mental Health Care Results in Serious Harm. \n \n107.  The  failure  to  provide  mental  health  care  has  substantially  injured  people \nincarcerated at DWCC. They have unnecessarily suffered from the treatable symptoms of mental \nillness, the exacerbation of symptoms of mental illness, increased instances of discipline and \nnon-conforming behavior, the development of new mental illnesses, the increased need for \ntreatment, and the diminished chance of successfully treating the mental illness in the future. The \nabysmal care causes serious and potentially irreversible harm to many of the men housed at \nDWCC.  \n108.  All prisoners on extended lockdown are subjected to the risk that a mental illness \nwill develop and that Defendants will leave it untreated. \n109.  It is well established that solitary confinement and extended cell confinement can \nhave devastating effects on the mental well-being of a person.  The conditions of solitary \n22 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 1   Filed 02/20/18   Page 23 of 53 PageID #:  23\nconfinement  and  extended  lockdown  at  DWCC  are  not  merely  abusive  or  psychologically \npainful, they cause the onset or major deterioration of Plaintiffs’ mental illnesses. \n  a.  Defendants’ Policies and Practices Harmed and Continue to Harm the Named  \n    Plaintiffs. \n \n110.  The Defendants’ policies and practices for screening, treatment, and medication \nof mental illnesses on extended lockdown have harmed, and continue to harm, Anthony Tellis \nand Bruce Charles, the named Plaintiffs to this case. \n111.  These same policies and practices inflict the same harm on other members of the \nputative class and sub-class. \n  i.  Plaintiff Anthony Tellis \n \n112.  Plaintiff Anthony Tellis was processed into the DPS&C on October 1, 2008. Mr. \nTellis was administered a Personality Assessment Inventory at Forcht-Wade Correctional Center. \nThis test indicated that “[t]his inmate’s clinical scale elevation profile suggests that the inmate is \nexperiencing mild to moderate psychiatric distress and impairment.  This distress appears to be \nmanifested in anxiety, character pathology, paranoia, and psychotic symptoms.”   \n113.  The  DPS&C  transferred  Mr.  Tellis  to  David  Wade  Correctional  Center  for \nhousing. Defendants LeBlanc and Goodwin maintain a policy requiring that every individual \narriving at DWCC be housed in one of the extended lockdown units for a period of 90 days \nbefore they are eligible to be moved into general population at the prison.  Some individuals are \nnot transferred into general population and remain on extended lockdown. \n114.   On October 6, 2008 Mr. Tellis received his intake screening at David Wade \nCorrectional Center.  That screening indicated no mental health diagnosis or history. It showed \n23 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 1   Filed 02/20/18   Page 24 of 53 PageID #:  24\nno mental illness and categorized him as Level of Care2 (hereinafter “LOC”) 5 which indicates \nthat he has no mental healthcare needs. This screening is directly contrary to the assessment \nconducted five days earlier.  \n115.  On October 21, 2008, after two weeks in solitary confinement, Anthony Tellis \ncomposed a letter to the mental health department at DWCC.  In this letter he stated, “I need help \nmentally coping with [the] situation at hand” and “I’m being treated like an [sic] death row \nprisoner for no apparent reason.”  He stated that “This matter is causing depression [. . .].”   \n116.  Two days later, on October 23, 2008, program manager and layperson Defendant \nHayden entered a note in Mr. Tellis’ file stating that all of Mr. Tellis’ findings are within normal \nlimits. He noted that Mr. Tellis requested to be moved from extended lockdown.  The form \ncontains no reference to mental health treatment. It only states that Mr. Tellis will be referred to \nclassification and there will be follow-up per policy.   \n117.  Defendant Hayden is not qualified to assess whether an individual needs mental \nhealth care or whether an individual’s mental state is within normal limits. Defendant Hayden’s \nlay opinion effectively ended DWCC’s early inquiry into Mr. Tellis’s mental state in 2008. \nAnthony Tellis never received any further evaluation or follow-up from a licensed mental health \nprofessional. \n118.  Nearly three months later, on January 13, 2009, Mr. Tellis received a visit from \nSteve Hayden. During that visit, Hayden noted that Mr. Tellis made no mental health complaints. \nMr. Tellis did not raise any mental health concerns at that time because he was afraid Hayden \nwould keep him in extended lockdown longer if he raised the mental health issues again. This \n                                                 \n2 The DPS&C categorizes prisoners into five LOC groups, with LOC 1 for the individuals with the most serious \nmental health needs and LOC 5 for individuals with no significant mental health needs. \n24 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 1   Filed 02/20/18   Page 25 of 53 PageID #:  25\nfear was rooted in the fact that DWCC has no mental health unit and that individuals with mental \nillness are often kept indefinitely in extended lockdown. \n119.  Mr. Tellis had no disciplinary record at that time and was only being held in \nextended lockdown pending initial his classification for housing in the general population. Mr. \nTellis received another follow up segregation interview on March 4, 2009 before being released \ninto the general population. \n120.  On December 15, 2009, Mr. Tellis again requested mental health services for \naddiction,  anger  management,  and  parenting  in  writing.  In  general  population,  Mr.  Tellis \nreceived anger management and family group counseling, but no individual counseling.  \n121.  On February 12, 2016, Mr. Tellis assaulted another prisoner. The other prisoner \ndied from pneumonia following injuries from that fight. Mr. Tellis was placed on strip cell \nsubsequent to that altercation. \n122.  On February 18, 2016, Defendant Seal met with Mr. Tellis. In a meeting that \nlasted less than ten minutes, he received no diagnosis.   \n123.  On April 21, 2016, Mr. Tellis was diagnosed with “mood disorder, not otherwise \nspecified”  and  prescribed  Celexa,  a  selective  serotonin  reuptake  inhibitor  used  to  treat \ndepression. \n124.  On November 3, 2016, Mr. Tellis was placed on suicide watch. His existing \nmental health problems had reached a crisis. He remained on suicide watch for approximately 24 \nhours. \n125.  Mr. Tellis has remained on extended lockdown since February 2016.  \n126.  Mr. Tellis currently complains of auditory and visual hallucinations. \n25 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 1   Filed 02/20/18   Page 26 of 53 PageID #:  26\n127.  Mr. Tellis’ situation demonstrates that Defendants do not follow-up on initial \ndiagnostic screenings, and do not provide any counseling or therapy in extended lockdown \nregardless of circumstances, and the severe psychological consequences of prolonged solitary \nconfinement and lockdown. \n  ii.   Plaintiff Bruce Charles \n128.  Plaintiff Bruce Charles was processed into DPS&C custody on February 20, \n2013.  \n129.  On June 2, 2016, he arrived in extended lockdown at DWCC on transfer from \nAllen Correctional Center. \n130.  On June 6, 2016, Mr. Charles received cursory and contradictory intake and \nreview screenings.  \n131.  First, on June 6, 2016, Defendant Hayden completed a “Mental Health Intake \nScreening” for Mr. Charles. Hayden marked that his mood, affect, and thought process were \nwithin normal limits. He noted that Mr. Charles denied any current symptoms, suicidal ideation, \ntreatment, or psychotropic medications. He wrote that “prior treatment” was “none.”  \n132.  The DOC records for Mr. Charles prior to this date show, conversely, that Mr. \nCharles reported a diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder dating back to 2001, has been prescribed \npsychotropic medications since the age of 12, was prescribed Depakote while incarcerated, had \ntreatment plans citing mood instability and depressed mood, and had been placed on mental \nhealth observation several times.  \n133.  Also on June 6, 2016, Defendant Hayden completed a “Level of Care Review” for \nMr. Charles. Under “Axis I diagnosis” he circled “none indicated.” Under “Diagnosis” in the \n“Severe Mental Illness” section, he checked “Bipolar Disorder” and entered a diagnosis date of \n26 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 1   Filed 02/20/18   Page 27 of 53 PageID #:  27\nDecember 10, 2013. He assigned Mr. Charles to LOC 5h. LOC 5 indicates no current mental \nillness, and the modifier “h” indicates a history of mental illness.  \n134.  On June 9, 2016, Mr. Charles saw Defendant Seal for the first time in psychiatric \nclinic.  Defendant  Seal  noted  that  Mr.  Charles  was  not  currently  receiving  medication,  but \npreviously received Valproic acid, Seroquel, Zyprexa, and Risperdal. Mr. Charles reported that \nhe was struggling with sleep. Seal noted Mr. Charles’ mood to be fair, and his affect to be \nflattened. Seal diagnosed Mr. Charles as having Bipolar I and prescribed Depakote, with the \nmedication level to be checked in two weeks.  \n135.  The clinic assessment form documents that Mr. Charles would be scheduled for \nhis next psychiatric clinic in 4-6 months.  \n136.  On the same day, June 9, 2016, another Level of Care Review form was filled out, \nreassigning Mr. Charles from LOC 5 to LOC 3. Under Defendants’ policies, Mr. Charles would \nnot anticipate another encounter with mental health staff for the next 30 days at least, despite the \nfact that he was starting a potent psychotropic medication.  \n137.   On June 12, 2016, within three days of the Level of Care Review, Mr. Charles \nwas placed on extreme suicide watch after he tied a sheet around his neck in an attempt to hang \nhimself. \n138.  Defendant  Assistant  Warden  Dauzat  documented  the  attempted  hanging  in  a \n“Progress Note” but did not enter information for any of the 17 indicators of mental status. Mr. \nCharles was placed on extreme suicide watch following the attempt, and was downgraded to \nstandard suicide watch the next day.  \n139.  On June 14, 2016, Steve Hayden completed a “Progress Note” while visiting Mr. \nCharles on suicide watch. Hayden marked that his affect and mood were angry, his thought \n27 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 1   Filed 02/20/18   Page 28 of 53 PageID #:  28\ncontent was suicidal, his judgment was poor, his attitude was demanding, his behavior was \naggressive, and he had suicidal ideations. Hayden noted that Mr. Charles had a plan to harm \nhimself and begin a hunger strike.  \n140.  On the same day, June 14, 2016, Defendant Adkins also completed a “Progress \nNote” while visiting Mr. Charles. Adkins marked that his mood was normal, his affect was mood \ncongruent, his thought content was normal, his thought process was logical, his judgment was \nnormal, his attitude was cooperative, his behavior was normal, and he showed no significant risk \nof suicide. Defendant Adkins noted that Mr. Charles appeared in good spirits, and did not \ncomplain or try to persuade.  \n141.  On June 14, 2016, two days after Defendant Dauzat wrote a note documenting \nMr.  Charles’  suicide  attempt,  Defendant  Dauzat  signed  his  intake  screening.  This  intake \nscreening showed his level of care as 5h, no Axis I diagnosis, no suicidal ideation, no symptoms, \nno history of treatment, and no current treatment. Her signature follows the statements “The \ninitial  screening  data  have  been  reviewed,  and  needs  for  additional  screening  or \nassessment/consultation, if any, are documented in Section C”, and “Plan: Follow up per policy”. \nThere are no additional notes following this statement of review. Mr. Charles was still on suicide \nwatch when that document was signed. \n142.  On June 17, 2016, Defendant Hayden completed notes stating that Mr. Charles \nstill  had  suicidal  ideations  and  threatened  self-harm.  On  June  17,  2016,  Defendant  Adkins \ncompleted a note stating that Mr. Charles had clear thinking and felt better, and that “other than \nthe heat, all was well”.  \n143.  There is no documentation that Mr. Charles had any encounters with mental \nhealth staff on June 18 or June 19, while he remained on suicide watch.  \n28 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 1   Filed 02/20/18   Page 29 of 53 PageID #:  29\n144.  On June 20, 2016, Defendant Hayden noted that Mr. Charles had no suicidal \nideations or plans to self-harm, and released him from suicide watch. None of the documents \ncreated during this period record any diagnostic batteries, inventories, assessments, or instances \nof staff talking with Mr. Charles about psychosocial factors, support systems, his adjustment to \nmedication, his adjustment to a new environment, coping mechanisms, recognizing risk factors, \nor treatment options.  \n145.  Two weeks later, on July 4, 2016, Mr. Charles again reported suicidal ideations \nand was again placed on suicide watch. There is no documentation that Mr. Charles was seen on \nJuly 5. On July 6, 2016, Mr. Charles tied a sheet around his neck to attempt suicide. He was \nagain placed on suicide watch, and remained on watch until July 11, 2016. He received a \nsegregation interview on July 28. He was not seen again by mental health until October 10. \n146.  This  tangle  of  self-contradictory  progress  notes,  bungled  intake  process,  and \nsuicide watch is the clearly foreseeable result of Defendants’ policies and lack of planning and \navailable mental health resources.  \n147.  This pattern has continued since Mr. Charles arrived in extended cell confinement \nat DWCC with diagnosis of bipolar disorder.  He has since been on suicide watch five times, \nstripped belongings and mattress, clothed only in a short paper gown. He is not directly observed \nduring this time period. Twice, Mr. Charles has been placed on “extreme suicide watch” for \nattempted suicide, meaning he was chained and clothed only in a paper gown in his cell without \naccess to any stimuli or people.  The duration of Mr. Charles’ confinement in extended lockdown \nhas caused his health to deteriorate such that he consistently presents a danger to himself. \n148.  Mr. Charles is currently categorized as LOC 3 by the DPS&C. \n29 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 1   Filed 02/20/18   Page 30 of 53 PageID #:  30\n149.  The DPS&C defines LOC 3 as follows: “LOC 3 shall be assigned to offenders \nwith SMI (“serious mental illness”) and who have been in remission or have been stable for at \nleast six months. These offenders may live in the general housing areas. A SMI diagnosis is \ntypically chronic in nature and the offender will most likely remain diagnosed with SMI for the \nremainder of the offender's life. If they are stable, functional and have no major problem with \ncompliance then they should be designated as LOC 3.” \n150.  Mr. Charles’ condition routinely manifests as self-injurious or suicidal thoughts \nand actions. Because of the lack of screening and treatment, he is simply maintained on extended \nlockdown or suicide watch until the crisis manifestations of the chronic mental illness passes and \nhe temporarily recompensates.   \n151.  Mr. Charles’ diagnoses and behaviors are mismatched with his classification as \nLOC 3. His chronic mental illness has manifested repeatedly as suicidal behavior.  \n152.  Mr. Charles started Depakote, a trade name for valproic acid, in June of 2016. In \nMarch of 2017, Defendant Seal noted that he was “still only sporadically compliant”, determined \nby VPA levels in his system. Charles has no medication refusal forms in his record from this \ntime, and was never written up for having excess medication during shakedowns. If the Depakote \nwas not refused, not in his system, and not in his cell, it stands to reason that the medication was \nnot correctly dosed or delivered. There is no attempt by the Defendants to reconcile this serious \nmedication discrepancy.  \n153.  Mr. Charles reported suicidal ideations on April 12, 2017.  He was seen by the \nnurse on duty and told that because no mental health staff were available at the time, he would be \ntransferred to suicide watch. Mr. Charles did not want to move to suicide watch due to the harsh \nconditions. Staff informed him that if he refused suicide watch, he would receive a prison \n30 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 1   Filed 02/20/18   Page 31 of 53 PageID #:  31\ndisciplinary  charge  of  malingering.  Mr.  Charles  chose  to  accept  a  malingering  charge  and \nreceived a disciplinary action rather than being transferred indefinitely to suicide watch.  \n154.  On May 26, 2017, Mr. Charles again became suicidal due to deaths in his family.  \nHe was transferred to suicide watch. The prison stripped him of his clothes, gave him a paper \ngown and took away all of his possessions.  He received no mental health services to help him to \ncope with his loss or deal with the symptoms of his mental illness during that difficult time. \n155.  In June of 2017, Mr. Charles learned that another of his brothers had just died. In \nprotest against the absence of mental health services available to help him cope with his recent \nlosses, Mr. Charles went on hunger strike on July 7, 2017. Defendants placed Mr. Charles on \nsuicide watch due to his hunger strike. His family tried to visit him during this time and was \ndenied.   \n156.  Mr. Charles’ existing mental illness was greatly exacerbated due to Defendants’ \nuse of extreme isolation from family support and the absence of mental health staff to help deal \nwith his loss. \n157.  Mr. Charles has frequently been placed on suicide watch since his arrival at \nDWCC. No additional mental health diagnostics or screenings have been given to him despite \nhis reoccurring suicidal ideations. \n158.  This series of events clearly illustrates several of Defendants’ problematic policies \nand practices: (1) repeated use of suicide watch does not trigger any alarm bells that a prisoner’s \nmental health condition is not being effectively treated, (2) prisoners so dangerously unstable \nthat they require suicide watch are still considered to be sufficiently “in remission or stable” for \nthe purposes of level of care classification, (3) prisoners with known serious and chronic mental \nillnesses are placed in extended lockdown, (4) even as evidence of a serious mental illness \n31 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 1   Filed 02/20/18   Page 32 of 53 PageID #:  32\nmounts, there is no process for reconsidering whether extended lockdown is an appropriate \nsetting for treatment, and (5) Defendants apply the same schedule for mental health visits to all \nprisoners regardless of individual needs. \n  b.  Defendants’ Policies and Practices Harmed and Continue to Harm the Class  \n    Members. \n \n159.  The named Plaintiffs seek to represent the hundreds of men at risk of serious harm \nthrough Defendants’ policies. As illustrated by the following examples, the experiences of the \nmen at DWCC sadly follow the common experiences of Mr. Tellis and Mr. Charles, and those \nsystemic failures alleged in this Complaint.  \n  i.   Matthew Carroll  \n160.  Matthew Carroll has a history of mental health diagnoses and medication reaching \nback to age eight. While at Elayn Hunt Correctional Center, Mr. Carroll attempted suicide by \nswallowing a razor blade. On August 17, 2015, Mr. Carroll was transferred from EHCC to \nDWCC. Despite the record of those facts available to Defendants upon his arrival at DWCC, he \nreceived no mental health medication for one month following his transfer to DWCC. \n161.  Mr. Carroll received a diagnosis of Depression NOS (“Not Otherwise Specified”) \nupon his arrival at DWCC despite having received a diagnosis of intermittent explosive disorder \nand antisocial personality disorder on July 23, 2015 at EHCC.  Additionally, there are a number \nof notes documented while he was at EHCC that indicate psychotic features to his mental illness \nthat are not indicated in the documentation while he has been at DWCC.  \n162.  Mr. Carroll has a documented history of suicidal ideation and attempts since his \nincarceration, even prior to arriving at DWCC.  Upon his arrival at DWCC, he was placed on \nextended lockdown and has not left.  Mr. Carroll continues to go through cycles of suicidal \n32 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 1   Filed 02/20/18   Page 33 of 53 PageID #:  33\nideation  and  attempts  while  on  extended  lockdown  resulting  from  a  lack  of  treatment  and \nadequate response to requests for help and intervention for a mental health crisis.   \n163.  Mr. Carroll made a suicide attempt on September 22, 2017 in plain view of staff \non  the  tier  by  swallowing  a  handful  of  pills.    The  staff  ignored  Mr.  Carroll  and  did  not \nimmediately intervene to prevent the attempt or to provide immediate medical treatment until \nafter the shift change, between fifteen minutes and half an hour later.   \n164.  Following that attempt, Mr. Carroll was moved to EHCC for reasons unrelated to \nhis mental health. He was returned to DWCC shortly thereafter without any additional treatment \nplanning or diagnostics. \n165.  Following his return to DWCC, Mr. Carroll again attempted suicide by overdose \non or around January 16, 2018 and spent several days on suicide watch.  \n166.  Mr.  Carroll  was  placed  on  suicide  watch  following  his  attempt  but  was  not \nprovided with any therapy or assessments and did not speak with Defendant Seal. Mr. Carroll is \ncategorized as LOC 4, indicating mental illness that is not serious.  Since his arrival at DWCC \nhis diagnosis has been Depression NOS.  This diagnosis and level of care classification is not \nconsistent with his history of mental health treatment since the age of 8 or his persistent suicidal \nideation and behavior. \n  ii.  Prisoner AA \n167.  Prisoner AA is a man with significant mental illness who was held in extended \nlockdown and solitary confinement for an extended period at DWCC. During that period of time, \nhis mental illness deteriorated significantly.  \n168.  Prisoner AA wrote a sick call on February 17, 2016. He was not on DWCC’s \nmental health caseload at that time, despite having reported a history of major depression, and \n33 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 1   Filed 02/20/18   Page 34 of 53 PageID #:  34\nbeing documented as being disoriented, talking to himself, showing bizarre behavior, and having \nan inappropriate affect. The sick call requested help for depression, “heart hurting,” and trauma \nto head when he thinks or speaks too loud.  \n169.  The responder wrote that Prisoner AA was referred to mental health. No mental \nhealth assessment or treatment occurred.  \n170.  On September 27, 2016, Prisoner AA filled out another sick call using incomplete \nsentences, including “Mental, Mind, Brain, Depression. Feeling like my Brain getting strip out \nhead…No Sleep only eyes close…need medication for Depression Direct head attack”. The \nresponder’s assessment was “no suicidal thoughts expressed” and notified mental health.  \n171.  He  was  seen  a  month  later,  on  October  28,  2016,  when  Defendant  Aerial \nRobinson reported “rapid speech and bizarre thought content”, and ordered a psychological \nconsultation. On October 31, 2016, Prisoner AA had a segregation interview, the only form of \nmental health monitoring for prisoners without a diagnosis, and Steve Hayden wrote that he was \n“doing well” and denied any mental health concerns.  \n172.  Prisoner AA was seen by Defendant Seal on November 17, 2016, where he \nreported  depression,  and  requested  Cannabis  and  Ultram,  then  Wellbutrin.  Seal  noted  that \nPrisoner  AA  “didn’t  want  me  to  use  my  medical  judgment”,  he  was  irritable,  with  a \ncircumstantial thought process, but Defendant Seal made no diagnosis of any underlying mental \nhealth condition. Prisoner AA was reaffirmed as LOC 5 in December 2016.  \n173.  On January 3, 2017, Prisoner AA wrote another sick call with illogical language, \nincluding “head inside out need brain scan…having out space problem Aliens!” The responder \nnoted that he complained of space aliens invading his body, and referred to mental health. No \nmental health treatment or evaluation was given.  \n34 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 1   Filed 02/20/18   Page 35 of 53 PageID #:  35\n174.  Prisoner AA wrote a similar sick call on January 5, 2017, noting “trauma to whole \nBrain having problems Body Reality missing”. The responder noted “no medical issues” and \nnotified mental health. No mental health treatment was given.  \n175.  Prisoner AA was seen for a compulsory segregation interview on January 25, \n2017 by Steve Hayden. Hayden noted that Prisoner AA participated in casual conversation and \nreported no mental health concerns.  \n176.  Prisoner AA wrote a nonsensical sick call on March 8, 2017, and the responder \nwrote “unable to determine any specific medical problem” and determined “No tx [treatment] \nneeded”.  \n177.  On April 20, 2017, nurse Michelle Norris emailed Steve Hayden to request mental \nhealth contact because “Offender has rambling speech, flight of ideas.” Hayden responded seven \ndays later, stating that Prisoner AA had already been seen by Defendant Seal and “is seen per \npolicy by mental health”. As a LOC 5, Prisoner AA would only receive a segregation interview \nevery 90 days, per policy.  \n178.  On April 21, 2017, Prisoner AA wrote another sick call that was still nonsensical \nand nearly illegible. The responder noted rambling speech and that Prisoner AA moved all \nextremities with extreme difficulty, and that he had last seen mental health on November 17, \n2016. The responder again referred to mental health. A different writer added a note “make sure \nand reviews these sick call requests”. No mental health treatment was given.  \n179.  On  May  12,  2017,  Prisoner  AA  wrote  yet  another  rambling  sick  call  with \nreferences to the bible and the FBI. The responder noted multiple random complaints, and no \ntreatment  needed.  Hayden  again  documented  a  segregation  interview,  according  the  note, \n35 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 1   Filed 02/20/18   Page 36 of 53 PageID #:  36\nPrisoner AA allegedly participated in conversation and had no complaints, with no apparent \n“acute distress.”  \n180.  Prisoner AA’s level of care was reviewed on May 25, 2017, and changed from 5 \nto 5h. Another segregation interview was completed by Aerial Robinson on May 26, 2017, who \nfound that Prisoner AA was delusional with rapid, pressured speech, and had a preoccupation \nwith conspiracy theories. She referred for psych consult and would “follow up per policy.”  \n181.  Prisoner AA, still without any mental health treatment, wrote another illogical \nsick call on June 14, 2017. The responder noted rambling speech and difficulty moving limbs, \nbut also noted that he had already been referred to mental health on April 20, 2017.  \n182.  On August 24, 2017, months after staff documented their concerns about Prisoner \nAA’s mental status, Defendant Seal saw him again at clinic. Defendant Seal noted that staff \nreported that he seemed manic, talked about “the government,” and worked on blank sheets of \npaper as if he were writing on them. Prisoner AA again asked for Wellbutrin and Ultram, and \nrefused other medication because “he’s worried ‘they will make me crazy.’”  \n183.  Seal recorded that Prisoner AA was hyper-verbal, tangential, and having auditory \nhallucinations, and diagnosed him with Bipolar I.  \n184.  Prisoner AA’s pleas for help resulted only in Defendants’ creation of inadequate, \nself-contradictory reports, often made by staff unlicensed to provide mental health observations \nand assessments. These reporting problems result in his severe mental illness being ignored and \nunderdiagnosed, left to further destabilize and fall deeper into paranoia and delusions.  \n185.  Months  dragged  on  and  more  than  a  year  passed,  with  sick  calls  and  notes \nindicating progressively worse deterioration in expressive ability and clarity of thought. Each \nsick call and clinical visit should have led to the obvious conclusion that Prisoner AA suffers \n36 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 1   Filed 02/20/18   Page 37 of 53 PageID #:  37\nfrom severe mental illness. Defendants did not transfer Prisoner AA to EHCC for mental health \nevaluation and treatment until late 2017. \n  iii.  Carlton Turner \n186.  Carlton Turner has a diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder. In January and June of 2016, \nDefendant  Seal  had  diagnosed  Mr.  Turner  with  only  Major  Depression,  although  he  was \nprescribed both an antipsychotic and an antidepressant. On August 12, 2016, around 8:30AM, \nstaff found Mr. Turner sitting on the floor bleeding due to having cut his own scrotum. He was \ntreated in the infirmary, and visited by Defendant Assistant Warden Dauzat, who noted that he \nrefused to converse. He was ordered into the restraint chair on Extreme Suicide Watch.  \n187.  After 10 hours, Mr. Turner was downgraded to alternative restraints by verbal \norder,  after  nursing  reported  that  he  was  calm  and  not  attempting  to  remove  stitches.  He \nremained in a camera cell, with continued orders to be checked every 15 minutes and at random. \nLieutenant Gary Carter recorded on a suicide watch log that he checked on Mr. Turner at \n10:10AM, and Mr. Turner was laying on his bunk. Lt. Carter completed an unusual incident \nreport stating that, at 10:25AM, he was passing out cups and sporks for mealtime, when he \nobserved Mr. Turner, who was bleeding from his right wrist with a puddle of blood on the floor.  \n188.  Upon receiving a call from nursing that Mr. Turner had cut himself, Defendant \nDauzat again verbally ordered him into the restraint chair. Mr. Turner was again downgraded to \nalternative restraints after 10 hours in the restraint chair, because he had conversed with nursing \nstaff and hadn’t expressed a current intent to harm himself. The following morning, Mr. Turner \nremained  on  Extreme  Suicide  Watch  with  15-minute  observations.  Lieutenant  Gary  Carter \nlogged that he checked on Turner at 6:21AM, and Mr. Turner was sleeping.  \n37 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 1   Filed 02/20/18   Page 38 of 53 PageID #:  38\n189.  Carter  completed  another  Unusual  Occurrence  Report  documenting  that,  four \nminutes later, at 6:25AM, Carter had been passing out cups and sporks when he observed Mr. \nTurner with arms outstretched and blood dripping from his left wrist. Medical was called after \nMr. Turner was escorted to the lobby in full restraints, and he was treated. Defendant Dauzat was \nthen called, and for a third time she verbally ordered Mr. Turner, now with wounds on both \nwrists and his genitals, to be strapped to a chair.  \n190.  At evening shift change 12 hours later, Defendant Dauzat documented that, with \nverbal  concurrence  by  a  staff  physician,  Dr.  Fuller,  due  to  his  self-harm  and  lack  of \ncommunication with staff, he would be left in the restraint chair, while mental health staff went \nhome for the night. The following morning, while Mr. Turner was allowed a break from the chair \nand lay in his cell in other restraints, he repeatedly hit his head against the bunk, causing a \nbloody wound. He refused to converse when visited by Defendant Hayden. This was the first \ntime mental health staff attempted to see or speak with him in three days, after he had spent over \n40 hours with his limbs strapped to a chair and intentionally injured himself four times.  \n191.  Mr. Turner was placed in a helmet and returned to the restraint chair. Hayden \nagain visited at 11:15AM, but Mr. Turner still refused conversation. Hayden observed “no \noutward aggression or attempts at self-injury”, although Mr. Turner was fully immobilized. He \nwas again downgraded to alternative restraints.  \n192.  Hayden visited again later, and alleged that Mr. Turner then reported that his self-\nharm was due to believing that he had been given a write-up, but had discovered that he had not \nreceived a write-up, and didn’t plan to harm himself. He was downgraded to Standard Suicide \nWatch, and released the next day.  \n38 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 1   Filed 02/20/18   Page 39 of 53 PageID #:  39\n193.  Mr.  Turner’s  escalating  suicide  attempts  did  not  prompt  any  mental  health \ntreatment, counseling, or assessment. None of these events triggered any actual diagnostics. \nSatisfied with the explanation that Mr. Turner was upset over a write-up, Defendants ignored the \nobvious evidence that underlying mental illness caused Mr. Turner to mutilate his genitals and \ncut his wrists. \n194.  On September 23, 2017, Mr. Turner attempted suicide on by making a 12-foot \njump over barbed wire and onto concrete. He documented clearly in writing that his plan to \ncommit suicide was due to insufficient mental health treatment, an inability to be transferred to a \nfacility with adequate mental health treatment, and retaliation for speaking with attorneys. He \nreceived a disciplinary write-up for “general disobedience” as a result of the incident. \n195.  While in the hospital, the psychiatric sections of his plan of care, for a span of \nonly three weeks, included 7 goals and 27 modes of intervention. He was seen daily by a \nlicensed psychiatrist and his medication was constantly monitored. The only change to his \nmental health care that followed him back to DWCC was a change in his medication to lithium. \n196.  Mr. Turner has now been returned to extended lockdown. He continues to require \nmultiple surgeries and faces the possibility of amputation of his leg due to injuries sustained in \nhis most recent suicide attempt.  \n  iv.  Terrence Goudeau \n197.  Terrence Goudeau, an individual with serious mental illnesses held on extended \nlockdown, frequently requested mental health evaluation and treatment from Defendants.  He \nnever received any such treatment.  He hanged himself in June 2016.  The death of Goudeau \nillustrates the serious harm that may come from the deliberate indifference of staff at DWCC to \nserious mental illness. \n39 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 1   Filed 02/20/18   Page 40 of 53 PageID #:  40\n  h.  Tyler Blanchard \n198.  Tyler Blanchard is a man who reports a history of Bipolar, PTSD, and OCD. His \nonly diagnosis given by Defendant Seal is Depression. Shortly before 1:00AM on September 16, \n2016, an officer making rounds noticed that Mr. Blanchard was bleeding from his left forearm. \nThe captain was notified, and Mr. Blanchard was placed in full restraints and escorted to the \nlobby, where a nurse cleaned his wounds.  \n199.  Defendant Assistant Warden Dauzat was contacted by the nurse, and verbally \nauthorized Extreme Suicide Watch with verbal concurrence from staff physician Dr. Fuller. \nDefendant Dauzat never saw or spoke to Mr. Blanchard, or offered any type of treatment. Mr. \nBlanchard was then returned to an observation cell while in full restraints. At about 2:45AM, the \nsame officer again noticed Mr. Blanchard bleeding from his arm. Mr. Blanchard was supposed to \nbe on 24-hr camera observation, but no one saw or prevented him from attempting suicide.  \n200.  Mr. Blanchard was again brought to the lobby in restraints to have his wounds \ncleaned. Defendant Dauzat was again called, and she directed that Mr. Blanchard be strapped to \nthe restraint chair, again without seeing him, speaking to him, or offering any type of mental \nhealth treatment to a man who attempted suicide twice in a span of two hours. At 4:03AM, the \nsame officer, while making rounds, noticed that Mr. Blanchard was banging his head against the \nwall. While still on 24-hour camera observation for two consecutive suicide attempts, no other \nstaff noticed his active self-harm.  \n201.  Mr. Blanchard was then wheeled to the lobby, still strapped to the restraint chair, \nwhere a helmet was placed on his head at the authorization of Defendant Dauzat, and he was \nreturned to the cell. Mr. Blanchard was still not given any therapeutic intervention despite doing \neverything within his ability to harm himself.  \n40 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 1   Filed 02/20/18   Page 41 of 53 PageID #:  41\n202.  Later that day, Defendant Adkins, acting as chaplain, visited Mr. Blanchard. \nDuring that visit, Adkins noted that Mr. Blanchard, who had each of his limbs strapped to a \nchair, able to move only his neck, and had been kept there for several hours, was “not readily \ntalkative”. After 12 hours immobilized in the restraint chair, Mr. Blanchard was released by a \nnurse, and downgraded to Standard Suicide Watch.  \n203.  Because it was the weekend, Mr. Blanchard did not see a mental health staff \nmember for another three days. For the three subsequent days, Mr. Blanchard reported thoughts \nof self-harm and suicide, without any therapeutic intervention. On the fourth day, he did not \nreport such thoughts, and was released. Mr. Blanchard spent 32 days on suicide watch during \n2016, and cut himself 5 times.  \n204.  He received no counseling or treatment other than Wellbutrin.  \n205.  Mr. Blanchard reports that he cuts himself to relieve pain and stress, because there \nis no other treatment provided. Mr. Blanchard reports that he continues to harm himself, often by \npunching  his  cell  walls  until  his  hands  become  injured.  Defendants’  only  response  to  this \nbehavior is to threaten him with chemical restraints unless he stops the behavior.  \n206.  Mr. Blanchard states that he would like therapy or counseling to understand why \nhe hurts himself and how to avoid handling his feelings that way. Developing that type of insight \ninto  his  behavioral  problems  is  not  achievable  only  through  medication  and  medication \nmanagement. \n207.  Following this incident, Defendants made no changes to Mr. Blanchard’s mental \nhealth care treatment plan, and provided no counseling or other interventions. Mr. Blanchard \nremains on extended lockdown at DWCC. \n41 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 1   Filed 02/20/18   Page 42 of 53 PageID #:  42\n208.  Defendants  are  deliberately  indifferent  to  the  risks  of  harm  to  which  they \nsubjected Mr. Tellis, Mr. Charles, Mr. Carroll, Mr. Turner, Prisoner AA, and Mr. Blanchard. \nE.  Defendants Respond Brutally to Symptoms of Mental Illness, Requests for Mental \nHealth Treatment, and Attempts to Redress Grievances \n \n209.   There is a culture of cover-up and excessive force at David Wade, including \nexcessive use of chemical agents and force on prisoners with serious mental illness. This culture \nis established and tolerated by each of the named Defendants to this litigation.  \n210.  Prisoners reporting serious mental illness for themselves or others are threatened \nand receive serious disciplinary punishment, including Policy 34 and isolation. \n211.  Defendants have warned Mr. Charles and several putative Class members that \ntheir continued participation in the investigation of mental health conditions at DWCC would \nlead to retaliation. Defendants have offered promises of putting in a “good word” toward a \ntransfer to another facility in exchange for individual cooperation to cease participating in the \ninvestigation.  \n212.  A significant portion of individuals that undersigned counsel has met with over \nthe course of responding to complaints about conditions at DWCC have intentionally been \nmoved out of the prison. This includes many individuals with significant mental illness who \nwere moved to acute care units elsewhere in the DPS&C. \nF.  Defendants Systematically Deny Plaintiffs Delivery of Mail to and from Counsel. \n \n213.  Defendants interfere with counsels’ ability to collect facts and discern legally \nrelevant conditions at DWCC by intentionally denying prisoners the ability to send letters to the \nAdvocacy Center and MacArthur Justice Center. \n214.  The volume of correspondence that prisoners have sent to the Advocacy Center \nand  MacArthur  Justice  Center  but  which  never  arrived  demonstrates  a  clear  pattern  of \n42 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 1   Filed 02/20/18   Page 43 of 53 PageID #:  43\ninterference  directed  at  deliberately  and  systematically  preventing  correspondence  between \nPlaintiffs and their counsel. \n215.  There is no legitimate penological interest in destroying or misplacing mail to \ncounsel.  \n216.  Plaintiffs’ correspondence with counsel in this case is related to non-frivolous \nclaims under the Constitution and federal law.  \n217.  Defendants  additionally  have  a  policy  of  seizing  documents  and  disciplining \nprisoners who bring legal documents to attorney visits if that document has another prisoner’s \nname on it. This practice intimidates potential witnesses, invades the attorney client privilege, \nand interferes with peoples’ access to information and the courts by prejudicing their ability to \ncommunicate with counsel. \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \nPLAINTIFF CLASS AND SUB-CLASS DEFINED \n218.  Plaintiffs bring this action under 42 U.S.C. §1983, for violations of the First and \nEighth Amendments to the United States Constitution on behalf of all prisoners currently held, or \nwho will in the future be held, in extended lockdown at DWCC in the N-1, N-2, N-3, and N-4 \nbuildings. \n219.  Plaintiffs also bring this action under the ADA and Section 504 on behalf of a \nsub-class of all prisoners with disabilities related to mental health, or who are perceived as \nhaving such disabilities, currently held, or who will in the future be held, in extended lockdown \nat DWCC in N-1, N-2, N-3, and N-4.  \n \n \n43 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 1   Filed 02/20/18   Page 44 of 53 PageID #:  44\nA.  The Class Satisfies the Elements of Fed. R. Civ. P. 23 \n  1.  Numerosity \n220.  The members of the class are too numerous and fluid to be joined as individual \nparties to this litigation.  \n221.  The South Compound is comprised of five buildings, N-1 through N-5. Buildings \nN-1 through N-4 are “extended lockdown” units subject to this litigation. In each of the buildings \nthere are four tiers.  On each tier are 16 cells, some of which are individual cells and some of \nwhich are doubled.  In each of the four buildings, there are 64 cells.  At a maximum, if each cell \non a building houses double cells there are 128 individuals in the building.  At a given time, there \ncould be upwards of 500 individuals being housed in the South Compound. \n222.  According to a report issued in 2017 by the Department of Justice’s Bureau of \nJustice Statistics, 37% of prison inmates have a mental health diagnosis.3 That same report \nindicated  that  during  any  given  30-day  period,  approximately  14%  of  prison  inmates  are \nexperiencing  “serious  psychological  distress”  according  to  the  criteria  of  the  study’s \nmethodology.4 \n223.  The number of individuals housed on lockdown at DWCC with mental illness is \nsignificantly higher than these national statistics because of the practices of the Defendants, \noutlined above, which utilize the extended lockdown compound as a substitute mental health unit \nthat in turn creates and exacerbates mental illness.  \n224.  Joinder of the individuals in this Class is impracticable because prisoners are \nroutinely transferred in and out of DWCC as well as transferred between general population and \n                                                 \n3 Department of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics, Indicators of Mental Health Problems Reported by Prisoners \nand Jail Inmates, 2011-12 (2017) http://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=pbdetail&iid=5946 (last visited December 4, \n2017) \n \n4 Id. \n44 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 1   Filed 02/20/18   Page 45 of 53 PageID #:  45\nextended  lockdown.    Regardless  of  the  duration  of  time  an  individual  may  be  housed  on \nextended  lockdown  before  transferring  out,  he  is  still  forced  to  endure  the  inhumane  and \nunlawful conditions cultivated by the Defendants.   \n225.  This Class also contains future members.  \n226.  The sheer number of affected individuals, the fluidity of the Class members, and \nthe  fact  that  the  proposed  Class  contains  future  members  all  militate  toward  a  finding  of \nnumerosity.  \n  2.  Commonality \n227.  The violations of the Eighth Amendment, ADA, and Section 504 alleged herein \nare caused by the policies and systemic practices of the Defendants.  \n228.  Each prisoner held in extended lockdown is harmed by the brutal and inhumane \nconditions inflicted on prisoners in extended lockdown. Every individual housed in DWCC’s \nlockdown  units  is  subjected  to  the  Defendants’  deliberate  indifference  to  unconstitutional \nconditions of confinement and is exposed to the risk of serious mental illness or self-harm.  \n229.  Each  individual  on  extended  lockdown,  and  especially  those  in  solitary \nconfinement, is placed at extreme risk of developing a mental illness due to Defendants’ policies, \npractices and procedures. \n230.  Each claim shares a common core of fact and law: First, there is the factual \nquestion of Defendants’ implementation of the policies and practices as described herein. The \nquestions of fact and law as to whether those policies create an objective risk of serious harm are \nalso shared across the entire Class, regardless of whether each individual Class member exposed \nto the risk developed symptoms. And, finally, the entire Class shares the common question of \n45 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 1   Filed 02/20/18   Page 46 of 53 PageID #:  46\nwhether Defendants’ subjective intent in carrying out these policies was deliberately indifferent \nto the risks. \n  3.  Typicality \n231.  Bruce Charles and Anthony Tellis are both typical members of the Class.  \n232.  Plaintiffs  reallege  the  facts  above  to  show  that  they  have  all  been  failed  by \nDefendants’ system of care, subjected to brutal conditions, and suffered grievous harm. \n233.  The inadequacies of initial screening have harmed Plaintiffs Charles and Tellis. \nPlaintiffs Tellis and Charles were both exposed to significant risks due to failure to identify \nsignificant mental illness. Defendants placed Mr. Tellis extended lockdown without any mental \nhealth services despite indicators of mental illness from his intake at EHCC. Paragraphs 114-\n119.  Mr. Charles was categorized as having no significant mental illness despite having a \ndiagnosis of bipolar disorder and being on suicide watch at the time of his evaluation. Paragraphs \n128-37. \n234.  Requests for mental health treatment and reports of mental health crisis by both \nnamed Plaintiffs were met with little to no response. Paragraphs 115 and 153. \n235.  Following  placement  on  suicide  watch,  neither  named  Plaintiff  received  any \nadditional screenings, diagnostics, or other mental health care as a result of their heightened risk \nof self-harm. \n236.  Like all prisoners on extended lockdown at DWCC, named Plaintiffs are not \nprovided access to counseling, group therapy, or support groups. Any communications with \nDefendant Seal are not confidential and do not promote communication of issues relating to \nmental  illness.    Plaintiffs  are  not  provided  with  individualized  treatment  plans  and  goals.  \n46 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 1   Filed 02/20/18   Page 47 of 53 PageID #:  47\nPlaintiffs Tellis and Charles receive the same treatment plan with the same generalized goals that \nare not tailored to address issues relating to mental illness. Paragraphs 78-84. \n237.  The named Plaintiffs are subjected to suicide watch and extreme suicide watch \nsimply because it is Defendants’ only available response to any mental health issue or crisis. \nParagraphs 124 and 153. \n238.  The  named  Plaintiffs  are  frequently  deprived  of  medications  used  to  treat \nsymptoms of mental illness or are provided medications that are ineffective at treating the \nsymptoms.  Mr. Charles was not provided with medications when he arrived at DWCC until at \nleast after June 9, 2016. After having been deprived of his medication for one week, Mr. Charles \nattempted suicide three days after restarting his medication. Paragraph 128-37. \n239.  Each individual class representative advances the same legal theories, claims, and \nevidence. \n240.  Each individual class representative is seeking the same relief from this Court. \n  4.  Adequacy \n241.  Named Plaintiffs Charles and Tellis are both capable of representing the interests \nof absentee class members.  \n242.  There is no conflict of interest between Plaintiffs and Class members and the \nrepresentatives have common interests with the unnamed members.  All claims of named and \nunnamed members rest upon the policies, procedures, and practices of Defendants as a whole, \nand as such apply to all individuals housed in extended lockdown. \n243.  Class counsel are all members in good standing with the Louisiana Bar and \nMiddle District of Louisiana. Counsel is experienced in the conduct of class action litigation and \nprison litigation.  \n47 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 1   Filed 02/20/18   Page 48 of 53 PageID #:  48\n244.  Class counsel has been conducting an investigation into conditions at DWCC for \nsome  time.    Counsel  successfully  litigated  against  the  officials  of  the  DPS&C  to  address \ncounsel’s access to the prisoners and facilities at DWCC in furtherance of that investigation and \nhave worked with the DPS&C and Defendants to address issues under that settlement agreement. \n245.  Counsel  from  the  Advocacy  Center  is  empowered  under  federal  law  and \nrecognized by the state of Louisiana as the state’s Protection and Advocacy group for individuals \nwith disabilities, including mental illness. The Advocacy Center’s statutory mandate is to protect \nthe human and civil rights of people with disabilities. \nB.  The Sub-Class Satisfies the Elements of Fed. R. Civ. P. 23 \n246.  Each named Plaintiff is a representative of the class as well as the sub-class. \n247.  Each named Plaintiff is a person with a disability, and therefore a member of the \nSub-Class. \n248.  The claims for the violation of the ADA and Section 504, like the claims for the \nviolation of the Eighth Amendment, are based on the allegation that Defendants have been \nviolating the law by following their policies and practices. \n249.  The request for certification of the sub-class is otherwise identical to the request \nfor certification of the Class. \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nA.  Violations of the Eighth Amendment (Cruel and Unusual Punishment)  \n \n250.  By their policies and practices described herein, Defendants deprive Plaintiffs of \ntheir constitutional right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment, protected by the Eighth \nAmendment to the Constitution.  \n48 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 1   Filed 02/20/18   Page 49 of 53 PageID #:  49\n251.  The practices outlined above subject Plaintiffs to a substantial risk of serious harm \nand injury.  \n252.  Defendants are aware of the risks of harm and are deliberately indifferent to those \nrisks.  \n253.  Housing prisoners in these conditions does not serve any legitimate penological \nneed.  \n254.  Defendants  deprive  Plaintiffs  of  basic  human  needs  and  violate  present  day \nconcepts of human dignity.  \n \nB.  Violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act  \n255.  Plaintiffs bring their claims for the violation of the ADA on behalf of the sub-\nclass of individuals in extended lockdown who have mental illness. \n256.  Plaintiffs have disabilities due to mental illness, which interfere with their major \nlife activities. \n257.  Plaintiffs’ needs qualify them to receive mental health care, including therapy and \ncounseling. \n258.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate all allegations above herein.   \n259.  The Defendants knowingly and consistently discriminate against prisoners with \nmental  disabilities  by  failing  to  provide  them  with  reasonable  accommodation  for  their \ndisabilities and punishing them for behavior that is a product of their disabilities.  \n260.  Defendants have further knowingly discriminated against persons with disabilities \nas the result of Defendants’ methods of administration of their solitary confinement, extended \nlockdown, and mental health programs. \n49 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 1   Filed 02/20/18   Page 50 of 53 PageID #:  50\n261.  By placing prisoners with mental illness in extended lockdown, Defendants have \ndenied  prisoners  with  mental  illness  the  benefits  of  the  facility’s  services,  programs,  and \nactivities, including education, programming, recreation, exercise, and mental health treatment \nand services, thus discriminating against persons on the basis of their disability.  \n262.  Discrimination against prisoners with mental illness occurs particularly because \nprisoners do not receive mental health services sufficient to counteract the effects that extended \nlockdown and other forms of punishment have on mentally ill prisoners, which is more severe \nthan the impact it has on prisoners who are not mentally ill.  \n263.  The Defendants discriminate against prisoners with serious mental illness on the \nbasis of their disabilities. The Defendants routinely warehouse prisoners with serious mental \nillness in solitary confinement, and disproportionately place prisoners with serious mental illness \nin extended lockdown and especially solitary confinement.  \n264.  By  placing  prisoners  with  serious  mental  illness  in  extended  lockdown  and \nimposing behavior management plans and other forms of punishment, the Defendants (a) failed \nto furnish reasonable accommodation to prisoners with disabilities, (b) punish prisoners with \nserious mental illnesses for disability-related conduct; and (c) deprive prisoners with mental \nillness of access to adequate mental health care.  \nC.  Violation of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 \n265.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate all allegations above herein.   \n266.  Plaintiffs qualify as individuals with disabilities as defined in Section 504 of the \nRehabilitation Act of 1973. They have mental impairments that substantially limit one or more \nmajor life activity, including but not limited to thinking, concentrating, interacting with others, \n50 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 1   Filed 02/20/18   Page 51 of 53 PageID #:  51\nand controlling their behavior. They have records of having such impairment or are regarded as \nhaving such an impairment.  \n267.  The  Defendants  discriminate  against  prisoners  with  disabilities  by  failing  to \nprovide reasonable accommodation for their disabilities.  \n268.  Defendants discriminate against prisoners with disabilities solely on the basis of \ntheir disabilities in violation of Section 504.  \n269.  In  placing  prisoners  with  serious  mental  illness  in  extended  lockdown  the \nDefendants  have  deprived  prisoners  with  mental  illness  from  the  benefits  of  the  facility’s \nservices, programs, and activities, including education, programming, recreation, exercise, and \nmental health services, thus discriminating against them on the basis of their disabilities.  \nD.  Violation of the First Amendment   \n270.  Defendants  have  taken  extraordinary  steps  to  interfere  with  counsel’s \ninvestigation of conditions at DWCC by systematically interfering with mail sent by prisoners to \ntheir counsel, by punishing prisoners for bringing documents to attorney-client visits, and by \nrefusing counsel the ability to provide written materials prisoners. \n271.  Defendants’  interference  with  Plaintiffs’  communication  with  counsel  and \nretaliation based on the content of privileged documents violates the First Amendment. \n  \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \n272.  Plaintiffs request this court grant them the following relief: \nA.  Declare that this suit is maintainable as a class action pursuant to Federal Rules of \nCivil Procedure 23(a) and (b)(2);  \nB.  Adjudge  and  declare  that  the  acts,  omissions,  policies,  and  practices  of \nDefendants, their agents, employees, officials, and all persons acting in concert with them under \n51 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 1   Filed 02/20/18   Page 52 of 53 PageID #:  52\ncolor of state law or otherwise described herein have violated the rights of prisoner Plaintiffs and \nthe  class  they  represent  under  the  Eighth  Amendment’s  prohibition  on  cruel  and  unusual \npunishment  and  those  rights  protected  by  the  Americans  with  Disabilities  Act  and  the \nRehabilitation Act; \nC.  Enter  injunctive  relief  enjoining  Defendants  and  their  agents  from  subjecting \nPlaintiffs to the illegal and unconstitutional conditions, acts, omissions, policies and practices set \nforth above; \nD.  Award Plaintiffs the costs of this suit, and reasonable attorneys’ fees and litigation \nexpenses pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1988 and other applicable law; \nE.  Retain jurisdiction of this case until all Defendants have fully complied with the \norders of this Court, and there is a reasonable assurance that Defendants will continued to \ncomply in the future absent continuing jurisdiction; and  \nF.

Men at David Wade Correctional Center (hereinafter “DWCC”) are being held in \nextreme, abusive conditions.  They are held in prolonged solitary confinement or extended \nlockdown for months and years, often unable to go outside for weeks on end.  There is no \nexternal sensory stimulation—no television, no radio, and little human contact. Men held in these \nconditions are allowed to place one phone call per month to someone in the outside world.  \n2.  These  extreme  conditions  create  mental  illness,  and  exacerbate  pre-existing \nmental illness, causing psychotic decompensation and propensity for acts of self- harm. Some \n1 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 1   Filed 02/20/18   Page 2 of 53 PageID #:  2\npeople hear voices, or talk and scream to themselves. Some engage in cutting themselves and \nattempting suicide to escape the extreme conditions. Two men have sliced open their testicles \nand one attempted to cut off his ear. Another man climbed a barbed-wire fence and attempted \nsuicide by diving off headfirst. Others bang their heads against the walls. The people confined at \nDavid Wade are at immediate risk of harm without this Court’s intervention. \n3.  Prisoners are placed in extended lockdown, either in a double bunk cell or a more \nrestrictive solitary cell, without regard to whether they are already at risk for mental illness, \ndecompensation,  or  self-harm.    Once  on  extended  lockdown,  people  with  mental  illness \ndecompensate and symptoms become more severe. Staff then respond to symptoms of mental \nillness by using restraint chains on people in cells, chaining people to wooden restraint chairs, \nusing chemical spray on people in cells, issuing additional write-ups or criminal charges, taking \naway outdoor time, moving prisoners to more extreme isolation, and taking away all clothing, \nreading material, and mattresses as punishment.  \n4.  Virtually no mental health care is provided to prisoners on extended lockdown, \naside from scattershot, poorly administered and inconsistent medication. What minimal contact \nprisoners at David Wade have with a psychiatrist at the prison occurs once every three to six \nmonths, lasts less than ten minutes and is supervised by a security officer in the room. If \nprisoners at David Wade request mental health care they are placed on “suicide watch” which \nmeans that they are stripped of clothing and belongings, and held in a solitary confinement cell \non the disciplinary tier for weeks. Suicide watch is only provided on the disciplinary tiers. There \nis no lesser intervention provided and no otherwise functioning sick call or grievance system \navailable to seek mental health care.  \n2 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 1   Filed 02/20/18   Page 3 of 53 PageID #:  3\n5.  Plaintiffs bring this action for injunctive and declaratory relief to remedy the \ndestructive cycle imposed by Defendants in which prisoners suffer breakdowns due to untreated \nmental illness under harsh and brutal conditions, Defendants respond with punitive suicide watch \ninstead of treatment, Defendants ignore the worsening symptoms of mental illness, and then \nDefendants punish those who speak out or act out due to lack of treatment.  This cycle continues \nuntil the prisoner is either totally unable to care for himself and has to be transferred out of the \nprison into an acute care facility or is released on to the street.  This lawsuit seeks to enjoin the \nfailed  systems  that  deprive  prisoners  of  their  rights  to  humane,  civilized  conditions  of \nconfinement. \n6.  Plaintiffs Anthony Tellis and Bruce Charles, each an individual with a disability \nand prisoner of DWCC, bring this action under Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act \n(“ADA), 42 U.S.C. § 12131 et seq.; Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (Section 504), 29 \nU.S.C. § 794, and 42 U.S.C. § 1983 to remedy violations of the Eighth Amendment to the United \nStates Constitution.  \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n7.  Plaintiffs bring this action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and 42 U.S.C. § 12131 et \nseq., and 29 U.S.C. § 794. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § \n1331, § 1343, and § 2201. \n8.  Venue is proper in this district pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b), because many of \nthe events or omissions complained of occurred here, the Department of Public Safety and \nCorrections is headquartered here, and the Defendant Secretary resides here.  \n \n \n3 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 1   Filed 02/20/18   Page 4 of 53 PageID #:  4\nPARTIES \nA.   DEFENDANTS \n9.  Defendant James LeBlanc is the Secretary of the Louisiana Department of Public \nSafety and Corrections (“DPS&C”). Secretary LeBlanc is ultimately responsible for the control, \noversight, and functioning of all programs and facilities within the DPS&C, including David \nWade Correctional Center. He formulates, directs, and maintains all regulations of the DPS&C, \nand determines the DPS&C’s policies regarding management, personnel, and total operations. \nThis includes ultimate determination of facilities and conditions in which the DPS&C houses \npeople with mental illness. Defendant LeBlanc directs the DPS&C’s central office and field \nstaff,  which  are  charged  with  carrying  out  the  work  of  the  agency.  He  is  responsible  for \nprotecting the constitutional and statutory rights of all persons held by the DPS&C, including at \nDavid Wade Correctional Center.  Defendant LeBlanc is the final policymaker with regard to the \nconditions at DWCC. He has implemented or supported the implementation of the policies that \ncause harm to Plaintiffs, and has failed to implement additional policies that would prevent harm \nto Plaintiffs. He has oversight authority over DWCC, which he has failed to exercise to prevent \nharm to Plaintiffs.

PLAINTIFFS  \n18.  Plaintiff Anthony Tellis is a prisoner housed in extended lockdown at DWCC.  \nMr. Tellis first came into DWCC custody in 2008 and has been on extended lockdown since \nFebruary 2016.  He was not diagnosed with a mental illness prior to being incarcerated, but has \nsince developed mental illness.  Mr. Tellis is a person with a disability as defined in 42 U.S.C. § \n12102 and 29 U.S.C. § 705(9).  Mr. Tellis is being exposed to inhumane conditions in violation \nof the Eighth Amendment.  He is also being denied adequate mental health treatment and \nreasonable accommodations for his disabilities under the Americans with Disabilities Act and § \n504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.  Mr. Tellis is a representative of the putative class and \nsubclass. \n19.  Plaintiff Bruce Charles is a prisoner housed in extended lockdown at DWCC.  Mr. \nCharles has been in DWCC custody since June 2016 and has been housed on extended lockdown \nsince then.  He was diagnosed with bipolar disorder prior to his incarceration and that diagnosis \nwas recognized during his placement at the Dixon, Hunt, and Allen state correctional facilities \nprior to his transfer to DWCC.  Mr. Charles is a person with a disability as defined in 42 U.S.C. \n§ 12102 and 29 U.S.C. § 705(9).  Mr. Charles is being exposed to inhumane conditions in \nviolation of the Eighth Amendment.  He is also being denied adequate mental health treatment \nand reasonable accommodations for his disabilities under the Americans with Disabilities Act \nand § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.  Mr. Charles is a representative of the putative class \nas well as the subclass. \n20.  Plaintiffs bring this action under 42 U.S.C. §1983, for violations of the First and \nEighth Amendments to the United States Constitution on behalf of all prisoners currently held, or \n7 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 1   Filed 02/20/18   Page 8 of 53 PageID #:  8\nwho will in the future be held, in extended lockdown at DWCC in the N-1, N-2, N-3, and N-4 \nbuildings. \n21.  Plaintiffs also bring this action under the ADA and Section 504 on behalf of a \nsub-class consisting of all individuals on extended lockdown at David Wade Correctional Center \nwho have or are perceived as having a qualifying disability related to mental health, as defined \nwithin the Americans with Disabilities Act. This sub-class includes all individuals who develop \nsuch a mental illness during the duration of time they are incarcerated in extended lockdown. On \nbehalf of the sub-class, Plaintiffs advance claims pursuant to the First and Eighth Amendments \nas well as the ADA and Section 504.  \n \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \nA. The Physical Plant of Lockdown Units at David Wade Correctional Center \n \n22.  David  Wade  Correctional  Center  is  divided  into  two  compounds:  the  North \nCompound and the South Compound. The South Compound is comprised of five buildings, N-1 \nthrough N-5.    \n23.  The abuses complained of herein occur at the South Compound of the prison, \nbuildings N-1 through N-4, which are solitary confinement and extended lockdown tiers.1  \n24.  For the purposes of the litigation, extended lockdown refers to the confinement in \na cell for 23 to 24 hours per day. Solitary confinement refers to the subset of extended lockdown \nin which a single prisoner is confined alone in a cell with no regular social interaction for 23 to \n24 hours per day. \n                                                 \n1 N-5 is not subject of this litigation as it houses high-profile prisoners in different conditions than the other \nbuildings. \n8 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 1   Filed 02/20/18   Page 9 of 53 PageID #:  9\n25.  Each lockdown building has four linear tiers: A, B, C, and D. The tiers each have \n16 cells. These cells may used as double-man cells, except in the N-4 building, which is the \nsolitary confinement building.  \n26.  Of the 16 cells on each tier in N-4, the first two cells are reserved for individuals \nwho are on suicide watch. There is a camera in each of those cells, as well as in all cells on the \nN-4 C tier.  \n27.  The buildings are not consistently climate controlled. There is no air conditioning. \nFans were installed approximately a year ago. In the summer the cells are very hot, and in the \nwinter they are cold.  \nB.  Conditions in the David Wade Lockdown Units are Brutal and Inhumane. \n28.  All prisoners who are transferred to DWCC are housed in lockdown for a period \nof time prior to being moved to general population. The lockdown units also are used for any \nprisoner in general population who is suicidal or attempts suicide. Finally, the units are used for \nthe disciplinary population: prisoners who have committed a rule violation in general population \nmay be administratively sentenced to serve time in the lockdown buildings.  \n29.  On extended lockdown, individuals are allowed outside for fifty-five minutes per \nday Monday through Friday, unless they are on “yard restriction.” If on yard restriction, one is \nallowed outside for fifty-five minutes on Saturdays and Sundays. Many people are on yard \nrestriction for months or years on end.  Mr. Charles has been on yard restriction for nearly two \nyears. \n30.  People on extended lockdown get one ten-minute phone call per month. That \nphone call is not at a regularly scheduled time and thus there is no way to plan for a family \nmember to be available for the phone call. Staff may refuse a prisoner’s phone call without \n9 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 1   Filed 02/20/18   Page 10 of 53 PageID #:  10\ngiving any reason.  Staff will often refuse the call as retaliation against the individual requesting \nthe call.  Individuals on extended lockdown are unable to make attorney phone calls.   \n31.  Extended lockdown prisoners are not brought for a shower every day. Staff barter \nadditional food in exchange for prisoners waiving their shower time, do not wake sleeping \nprisoners for their showers, or simply ignore the prisoner and record the shower as having been \nwaived. \n32.  Prisoners on extended lockdown are allowed three books. There is no radio, \ntelevision, educational program, self-help program, or any other external stimuli on the tier. \nPrisoners who are not literate or who have become incapable of reading due to mental illness \nhave nothing to occupy their minds on extended lockdown.  \n33.  Prisoners cannot see one another as the cells face concrete walls and the outer \nwindows.  \n34.  Interactions between prisoners are forbidden by the written policy of DWCC, and \nthey may receive a disciplinary write-up for attempting to communicate with one another. \n35.  Prisoners on extended lockdown, especially those in solitary confinement, are \nallowed very little human contact.   \n36.  Most of the individuals serving disciplinary time on the lockdown units have been \ndiagnosed with one or more mental illnesses. Due to the lack of human contact and uncontrolled \nmental  illness,  many  will  scream,  laugh,  and  talk  to  themselves.  Others  rock  in  place  or \ndeteriorate to more severe manifestations of their conditions, such as smearing blood or feces. \nSome are unable to communicate at all.  \n10 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 1   Filed 02/20/18   Page 11 of 53 PageID #:  11\n37.  Prisoners who suffer a major psychiatric episode frequently lose the ability to take \ncare of themselves for the duration of such an episode. When a prisoner in extended lockdown is \nunable to care for himself, he may go weeks or months without a shower.  \n38.  Defendants maintain a policy styled “Offender Posted Policy 34(S),” hereinafter \n“Policy 34,” or “strip cell.” This policy permits staff to strip a prisoner of all belongings, \nincluding his mattress, in response to a perceived rule violation.  \n39.  Policy 34 is independent of any formal disciplinary sentence. It is deployed at \nstaff discretion with no due process protections or hearings. The absence of any procedural \nsafeguards means that a staff member who becomes upset with a prisoner may simply put the \nprisoner on Policy 34 without any showing that the prisoner has violated any institutional rules. \n40.  On Policy 34, prisoners are not allowed a mattress outside of the hours of 9pm to \n5am. Although the policy calls for mattresses to be returned at 9pm, they are frequently not \nreturned timely or at all. Prisoners will be housed this way for thirty days or more, at the whim of \nthe ranking correctional officers. This status is strictly punitive.  \n41.  If a prisoner on lockdown requests mental health care, he will usually be placed \non suicide watch.  \n42.  DWCC has two categories of suicide watch, standard and extreme.   \n43.  Prisoners on standard suicide watch are clothed only in a short paper gown.  The \nprisoner has no access to any property, including mattresses, letters, or books. He can only stand \nor sit in his cell on the concrete in a short paper gown. \n44.  On extreme suicide watch, the suicidal prisoner is housed in a paper gown without \naccess to property, but is additionally placed in restraints while in a cell alone.  Those restraints \nmay be: (1) four-point restraints, which consist of both hands being cuffed with the chain for the \n11 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 1   Filed 02/20/18   Page 12 of 53 PageID #:  12\ncuffs connected to a box to prevent movement or tampering, a belly chain connected to the \nhandcuff chain, and shackles on the ankles, (2) chaining a person to a restraint chair, which \nattaches each limb to the chair, or (3) the restraint chair with a helmet to prevent spitting and \nhead banging. DWCC staff sometimes restrain prisoners in this chair for days at a time, and often \nuse the chair rather than providing actual mental health care. \n45.  DWCC staff engage in targeted punishment of suicidal prisoners. Defendants \nrefuse to allow prisoners on suicide watch to visit with relatives or use the telephone to access \nany  source  of  outside  emotional  support.  Although  the  facility  possesses  suicide  resistant \nmattresses, those mattresses are often not given to prisoners on suicide watch, who must stand \nand sleep on the concrete. \n46.  In the winter, prisoners’ cells can be extremely cold. Prisoners uniformly report \nthat sometimes staff open windows near the suicide watch cells to make conditions even colder. \nBecause they do not have shoes or mattresses people must stand barefoot on concrete in a small \npaper gown.  \n47.  Eleven independent prisoners’ accounts confirmed that windows were left open \nlate December of 2017 and early January of 2018, including January 2, 2018, when temperatures \nin Homer, Louisiana reached a low of 14 degrees Fahrenheit. The use of extreme cold to punish \nbehavior on the tier is not a single isolated incident and occurs so frequently that prisoners have a \nword for it, “bluesing” or “getting bluesed.” \n48.  When a prisoner in extended lockdown decides to self-report a mental health \nneed, one must prepare to spend days and likely weeks without clothing, on a concrete floor, \nwithout a mattress, and without access to any property. Individuals are held in these conditions \n12 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 1   Filed 02/20/18   Page 13 of 53 PageID #:  13\nfor days or weeks at a time, irrespective of the actual risk of harm, whether other treatment \nmethods would be effective, and even once the threat of self-harm has subsided.  \n49.  These conditions function as a deterrent to requesting any mental health care at \nall.  Confining  Plaintiffs  to  suicide  watch  as  a  general  response  to  mental  health  concerns \nsignificantly chills willingness to report signs and symptoms of mental illness to staff. \n50.  The extreme isolation, deprivation of stimuli, severe punishments, and acts of \ntorture all work to create a significant risk of harm to the mental health of the people housed at \nDWCC.  \nC. Defendants Fail to Provide Adequate Mental Health Care and Are Deliberately \nIndifferent to Prisoners’ Mental Health Needs. \n \n51.  Defendants fail to provide any meaningful access to mental health care to the \nprisoners on extended lockdown. First, Defendants fail to identify prisoners with serious mental \nillness and consistently understate the severity of mental illness where it is identified. Second, \neven when an individual with mental illness is identified, every prisoner receives the same \ntreatment plan that calls for nothing except medication management. Third, when the inadequate \ntreatment causes a prisoner to decompensate, the only means Defendants employ to stabilize a \npatient  is  to  simply  place  the  prisoner  on  suicide  watch.  Fourth,  Defendants’  failure  to \nadequately staff the mental health program at the prison contributes to each of these problems.  \n52.  Each of these failed policies put prisoners at severe risk of mental illness and \nphysical harm. As outlined in Part C of this Complaint, these policies have caused actual harm to \neach named Plaintiff and to others housed at DWCC. Defendants act with deliberate indifference \nto these risks. \n \n13 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 1   Filed 02/20/18   Page 14 of 53 PageID #:  14\na.  Defendants’ Inadequate Mental Health Screening Places Prisoners at Risk of  \n    Serious Harm. \n \n53.  Mental health screening at DWCC is a failure at every juncture, including during \nintake, regular screening, and in response to crisis and suicide watch. Where screenings do occur, \nthe inadequacy of the process results in under-diagnoses of serious mental illness. \n54.  Defendants’  failure  to  identify  prisoners  with  serious  mental  illness  exposes \nprisoners  to  significant  risks  of  mental  and  physical  harm  and  deprives  prisoners  of  the \nopportunity to receive needed treatment. \n \n  i.  Defendants Place Prisoners on Extended Lockdown Without Adequate \n      Screening.  \n \n55.  Proper mental health screening is critical to the safety of prisoners.  \n56.  Prisoners sentenced to the DPS&C are often initially assessed at Elayn Hunt \nCorrectional Center (“EHCC”) before being assigned to a specific DPS&C facility for housing. \nEHCC has reception and diagnostic capacities, has a psychiatrist on staff, and has a special \nhousing unit for individuals with severe mental health needs.  \n57.  If a prisoner is placed by DPS&C at DWCC, David Wade staff then perform a \nmental health screening. Inexplicably, these assessments do not take into account the person’s \ninitial DPS&C evaluation or their DPS&C records. These screenings are cursory, unhelpful, and \nproduce results that are plainly contrary to facts already in the DPS&C’s own records. \n58.  The mental health screening is typically performed by Steve Hayden, who is not a \npsychiatrist, psychologist, social worker, or counselor.  \n59.  Prisoners known to the Defendants to have serious mental illnesses, including \nextensive histories of suicidal ideation and behavior, are routinely placed on extended lockdown \nat DWCC.  \n14 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 1   Filed 02/20/18   Page 15 of 53 PageID #:  15\n60.  Placement on extended lockdown further exposes a prisoner with serious mental \nillness  to  significant  risk  of  self-harm.  Defendants’  screening  mechanisms  disregard  the \ninformation available in the prisoners’ mental health records. \n61.  Likewise, when a prisoner is placed on extended lockdown for a disciplinary \nreason, Defendants do not conduct any review of records to identify whether the prisoner has a \nmental health diagnosis that would require treatment or care inconsistent with the extreme \nisolation of solitary confinement or extended lockdown. \n  ii.  Defendants Fail to Conduct Regular Screening for Mental Illness    \n      in Extended Lockdown. \n \n62.  The absence of observation and monitoring of individuals on extended lockdown \nmeans that psychiatric decompensation goes unnoticed, as does the onset of new symptoms. \n63.  Staff  at  DWCC  conduct  segregation  interviews  for  prisoners  in  extended \nlockdown approximately every 90 days. These interviews are conducted primarily by Defendant \nHayden and Defendant Robinson.  \n64.  The  segregation  interviews  that  are  conducted  are  cursory  and  diagnostically \nunhelpful.  The documentation produced as a result of a routine segregation interview will nearly \nuniversally indicate that the prisoner is “within normal limits” in all areas, even for prisoners \nwith serious mental health diagnoses. Interviews also usually indicate that the prisoner engaged \nin minimal conversation. \n65.  Signs and symptoms of serious mental illness remain unidentified or untreated \nand prisoners experiencing crisis manifestations of mental illness are not detected before the \nperson is a significant risk to himself or others. Plaintiffs Charles and Tellis have been harmed \nby the absence of ongoing screening for mental illness while on extended lockdown because they \nhave not been assessed for changes to their condition despite new and worsening symptoms. \n15 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 1   Filed 02/20/18   Page 16 of 53 PageID #:  16\n  iii.  Defendants Do Not Conduct Mental Health Screening in Response  \n      to Mental Health Crisis Situations. \n \n66.  Defendants do not respond to evidence of mental health crisis with any system of \nassessments, diagnostics, counseling, or treatment. \n67.  Defendants do not conduct screenings or make mental health resources available \nto prisoners with a pattern of suicidal ideation, even in the face of repeated mental health crises.  \n68.  Upon release from suicide watch, Defendants’ policy only calls for one follow-up \ninterview, to be conducted one week after the prisoner is taken off suicide watch. The follow-up \ninterview uses the same format as the “Segregation Interview” and does not call for any further \nmental health evaluations or services. \n69.  Other manifestations of illness that fall short of self-harm or suicidal ideation are \ntreated  as  disciplinary  violations  and  produce  no  mental  health  treatment  or  follow-up. \nDefendants  respond  to  yelling,  cursing,  refusing  to  move,  and  other  behavior  potentially \ndiagnostic  of  untreated  mental  illness  as  a  disciplinary  matter  rather  than  a  mental  health \nsymptom. \n70.  The  failure  of  DWCC’s  system  of  intake,  diagnosis,  and  routine  evaluation \nexposes all prisoners to the real risk that a mental illness will be left undiagnosed and untreated.  \nb.  Defendants Provide Inadequate Mental Health Treatment to Prisoners on  \n    Extended Lockdown. \n \n71.  Prisoners on extended lockdown receive virtually no treatment for mental illness. \nThere is no counseling, group therapy, or support group, regardless of an individual’s diagnosis \nor response to medication. \n72.  Prisoners  on  lockdown  in  DWCC  only  have  contact  with  a  contracting \npsychiatrist, Defendant Seal, every three months.  These visits last approximately 3-5 minutes.  \n16 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 1   Filed 02/20/18   Page 17 of 53 PageID #:  17\nA security officer is present in the room at every visit, and thus, if the patient wants to seek \nmental health care related to treatment by security staff, there is no confidentiality or privacy.  \nThese visits lack indicia of either diagnostic or psychotherapeutic purpose due to their short \nduration, infrequency, and lack of confidentiality. Defendant Seal’s signature does not appear on \nany  treatment  plans.  Defendant  Seal  never  prescribes  counseling,  group  therapy,  or  any \nintervention whatsoever other than medication. \n73.  Defendant Seal is retained by DWCC to provide these medication management \nvisits to prisoners.  Defendant Seal provides no other mental health services to prisoners in \nsolitary or lockdown. \n74.  In the event that a prisoner does not receive a prescription for any medication \nfrom Defendant Seal, that individual receives no mental health treatment plan whatsoever.  \n75.  Treatment for many mental health conditions requires more than just medication. \nThe chemical elements of treatment cannot replace therapy and counseling services to assist \npatients in coping with their mental illnesses. \n76.  All treatment plans for prisoners in solitary or extended lockdown at DWCC are \nsubstantively identical. \n77.  This generalized treatment plan that Defendants use to treat all Plaintiffs has no \nvalue. The treatment plan is the same regardless of diagnosis, treatment history, medication \nregimen, and all other individual circumstances.  \n78.  The long-term treatment goals in the treatment plans for everyone on extended \nlockdown are: “Long term treatment goals: 1. Maintain compliance with all institutional rules \nand regulations. 2. Maintain appropriate level of functioning. 3. Increase insight in order to be \nmoved to a less restrictive environment. Date Met: on-going.” \n17 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 1   Filed 02/20/18   Page 18 of 53 PageID #:  18\n79.  The  short-term  objectives  in  the  treatment  plans  for  everyone  on  extended \nlockdown are: “Short Term Objectives: Comply with medications prescribed and advise staff of \nany adverse effects, Identify stressors that create behaviors warranting segregation, Consistently \ndisplay appropriate behavior in accordance to institutional regulations.” \n80.  The treatment methods in the treatment plans for everyone on extended lockdown \nare absent. Each form cryptically states: “Treatment Methods: on-going.”  \n81.  The plans are also completely devoid of any required actions on the part of \nDWCC to provide any monitoring, counseling, or therapy, regardless of any patient’s medical \nhistory, diagnosis, or circumstances.  \n82.  The  Defendants’  treatment  plan  template  indicates  that  a  mechanism  for \nachievement should be coded beside each short-term goal, identifying how Defendants will help \nthe individual to achieve each identified goal. No treatment method codes are ever displayed and \nthere is never any narrative explanation of a treatment method. \n83.  Defendant Steve Hayden signed mental health treatment plans for both named \nPlaintiffs identifying himself as a “therapist.” Mr. Hayden is in fact not licensed by the State of \nLouisiana to provide mental health care in any capacity.  \n84.  The mental health treatment forms are also signed as “Reviewed by Michele \nDauzat, Assist. Warden, LCSW.” Assistant Warden Dauzat did not have any contact with the \nPlaintiffs in the formulation of their treatment plans. She almost never interacts with patients on \nthe lockdown units at DWCC, yet she approves their treatment plans. These plans are non-\nindividualized  and  do  not  reflect  any  individual  assessment  by  a  qualified  psychological \nprofessional.  \n18 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 1   Filed 02/20/18   Page 19 of 53 PageID #:  19\n85.  Plaintiff  Anthony  Tellis  received  a  mental  health  treatment  plan  exactly  as \ndescribed above on April 22, 2016, September 22, 2016, and January 5, 2017.  \n86.  Plaintiff  Bruce  Charles  received  a  mental  health  treatment  plan  exactly  as \ndescribed above on June 9, 2016. \n87.  Mental health care at DWCC consists exclusively of haphazard medication and \nrelegation to restrictive conditions of confinement. When a prisoner has a crisis manifestation of \na mental illness there are no interventions available other than suicide watch. The cursory \ntreatment plans reflect the complete absence of any other interventions.  \nc.  Defendants Deprive Prisoners of Needed Medications. \n88.  Upon transfer to DWCC, Defendants do not continue the medications that were \nbeing  prescribed  and  administered  in  the  facilities  where  the  prisoners  were  confined \nimmediately prior to the transfer.  As a result, a prisoner often waits weeks without necessary \nmedication, until he meets with Defendant Seal, receives a new prescription, and is integrated \ninto the medication distribution rotation. \n89.  Interruptions to mental health medications can trigger behavioral problems or \ncause additional symptoms in the patient’s underlying mental health condition. \n90.  Individuals who refuse medications are diagnosed as “in remission” despite a lack \nof review by a psychiatrist to determine whether the change in medication is appropriate.  \n91.  The record-keeping practices at DWCC are unreliable and dangerous.  Diagnoses \nshift without explanation.  Defendants discontinue or alter drug regimens with little paper trail.   \n92.  Defendant Seal’s clinical notes often indicate that a prisoner has stopped taking \nthe prescribed medication of their own accord. However, Defendant Seal’s clinical notes are \n19 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 1   Filed 02/20/18   Page 20 of 53 PageID #:  20\noften inconsistent with the medication distribution notes, which do not contain documentation of \nrefused medication. \n93.  When  prisoners  do  refuse  psychotropic  medications,  such  refusal  is  rarely \nproperly  documented.  Refusal  does  not  prompt  any  notification  to  a  psychiatrist  or  actual \nmedical  staff,  despite  possible  mental  and  physical  side  effects  of  suddenly  discontinuing \npsychotropic medications.  \n94.  This  failure  to  document  is  despite  the  fact  that  “comply  with  medications \nprescribed” is a goal on all generic treatment plans for prisoners in extended lockdown. \n95.  Mental health staff at DWCC frequently make decisions that are inconsistent with \nindividual health concerns that are clearly apparent in their own records. For example, there is no \nprocess  for  identifying  which  prisoners  are  on  medication  regimens  that  cannot  safely  be \nterminated without a step-down process. \nd.    Defendants Utilize Suicide Watch and Isolation as Substitutes for    \n    Necessary Mental Health Treatment  \n \n96.  There is no mental health treatment unit at David Wade Correctional Center.  \n97.  Due to the lack of general mental health screening and treatment by qualified \nstaff, Defendants use isolation and suicide watch as a response to any urgent request for mental \nhealth services, even if the request does not express suicidal ideation or threats of self-harm.   \n98.  Defendants’ notes from cell-front visits indicate that staff visits to people being \nheld on suicide watch are purely to determine whether the individual remains a threat to himself.  \nThe conversations are short and do not include any attempt to ascertain whether the individual is \nsuffering from worsening mental illness or is experiencing a crisis manifestation of a chronic \nmental illness.  \n20 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 1   Filed 02/20/18   Page 21 of 53 PageID #:  21\n99.  The underlying mental illness causing the self-harm risk is not addressed, due to \nthe complete lack of other mental health treatment and screening.  This often results in prisoners \nreturning to suicide watch multiple times.   \n100.  The harsh conditions of suicide watch and lack of treatment trigger psychiatric \ndeterioration and decompensation of prisoners.  People become trapped in a cycle of suicidal \nthoughts  and  self-harm,  deterioration  in  the  harsh  conditions  of  suicide  watch,  and  new \nbehavioral incidents caused by untreated mental illness. This results in additional disciplinary \nand self-harm actions. This cycle goes on ad infinitum. It prevents people from ever regaining \ntheir mental stability or leaving the disciplinary unit at the prison.  \n101.  Once they request urgent or crisis mental health care, prisoners are usually forced \nonto suicide watch as the only available intervention. If the prisoner refuses suicide watch and \nrequests other care, he may face a disciplinary charge of malingering.  The result is that many \npeople will remain quiet and silently suffer as mental health symptoms worsen to avoid choosing \nbetween the harsh conditions on suicide watch or a disciplinary charge.  \n102.  The putative Class members all face a risk of being subjected to the Defendants’ \npunitive,  non-therapeutic  policies  and  practices  pertaining  to  suicide  watch.    Given  the \nprevalence of under-diagnosed and untreated serious mental illness at DWCC, every prisoner \nhoused on the South Compound is at significant risk of being trapped in an ever-deepening cycle \nof untreated mental illness, crisis manifestations of the chronic mental illness, escalating crises, \nand housing on suicide watch. \ne.  Defendants Maintain Inadequate Mental Health Staffing  \n103.  Mental health services at DWCC are abysmally inadequate. There is one contract \npsychiatrist, Defendant Seal.  He only sees patients every ninety days—in the presence of \n21 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 1   Filed 02/20/18   Page 22 of 53 PageID #:  22\nsecurity staff-- for medication management. Prisoners are unable to otherwise request visits with \nhim.  \n104.  Unlicensed DWCC staff make mental health treatment and housing decisions \nbased upon cursory, uninformed, or limited interaction with prisoners.  \n105.  Defendant Steve Hayden is unqualified and unlicensed to provide mental health \ncare yet he makes most day-to-day decisions about care.  When he does walk-through the \nextended lockdown facilities, he does not provide any counseling services.  \n106.  Assistant Warden Michelle Dauzat is responsible for the mental health program at \nDWCC.    Warden  Dauzat  does  not  regularly  meet  with  prisoners  in  extended  lockdown.  \nHowever, she signs off on paperwork for individuals on extended lockdown without having ever \nseen her putative patients. \nD.  Defendants’ Lack of Mental Health Care Results in Serious Harm. \n \n107.  The  failure  to  provide  mental  health  care  has  substantially  injured  people \nincarcerated at DWCC. They have unnecessarily suffered from the treatable symptoms of mental \nillness, the exacerbation of symptoms of mental illness, increased instances of discipline and \nnon-conforming behavior, the development of new mental illnesses, the increased need for \ntreatment, and the diminished chance of successfully treating the mental illness in the future. The \nabysmal care causes serious and potentially irreversible harm to many of the men housed at \nDWCC.  \n108.  All prisoners on extended lockdown are subjected to the risk that a mental illness \nwill develop and that Defendants will leave it untreated. \n109.  It is well established that solitary confinement and extended cell confinement can \nhave devastating effects on the mental well-being of a person.  The conditions of solitary \n22 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 1   Filed 02/20/18   Page 23 of 53 PageID #:  23\nconfinement  and  extended  lockdown  at  DWCC  are  not  merely  abusive  or  psychologically \npainful, they cause the onset or major deterioration of Plaintiffs’ mental illnesses. \n  a.  Defendants’ Policies and Practices Harmed and Continue to Harm the Named  \n    Plaintiffs. \n \n110.  The Defendants’ policies and practices for screening, treatment, and medication \nof mental illnesses on extended lockdown have harmed, and continue to harm, Anthony Tellis \nand Bruce Charles, the named Plaintiffs to this case. \n111.  These same policies and practices inflict the same harm on other members of the \nputative class and sub-class. \n  i.  Plaintiff Anthony Tellis \n \n112.  Plaintiff Anthony Tellis was processed into the DPS&C on October 1, 2008. Mr. \nTellis was administered a Personality Assessment Inventory at Forcht-Wade Correctional Center. \nThis test indicated that “[t]his inmate’s clinical scale elevation profile suggests that the inmate is \nexperiencing mild to moderate psychiatric distress and impairment.  This distress appears to be \nmanifested in anxiety, character pathology, paranoia, and psychotic symptoms.”   \n113.  The  DPS&C  transferred  Mr.  Tellis  to  David  Wade  Correctional  Center  for \nhousing. Defendants LeBlanc and Goodwin maintain a policy requiring that every individual \narriving at DWCC be housed in one of the extended lockdown units for a period of 90 days \nbefore they are eligible to be moved into general population at the prison.  Some individuals are \nnot transferred into general population and remain on extended lockdown. \n114.   On October 6, 2008 Mr. Tellis received his intake screening at David Wade \nCorrectional Center.  That screening indicated no mental health diagnosis or history. It showed \n23 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 1   Filed 02/20/18   Page 24 of 53 PageID #:  24\nno mental illness and categorized him as Level of Care2 (hereinafter “LOC”) 5 which indicates \nthat he has no mental healthcare needs. This screening is directly contrary to the assessment \nconducted five days earlier.  \n115.  On October 21, 2008, after two weeks in solitary confinement, Anthony Tellis \ncomposed a letter to the mental health department at DWCC.  In this letter he stated, “I need help \nmentally coping with [the] situation at hand” and “I’m being treated like an [sic] death row \nprisoner for no apparent reason.”  He stated that “This matter is causing depression [. . .].”   \n116.  Two days later, on October 23, 2008, program manager and layperson Defendant \nHayden entered a note in Mr. Tellis’ file stating that all of Mr. Tellis’ findings are within normal \nlimits. He noted that Mr. Tellis requested to be moved from extended lockdown.  The form \ncontains no reference to mental health treatment. It only states that Mr. Tellis will be referred to \nclassification and there will be follow-up per policy.   \n117.  Defendant Hayden is not qualified to assess whether an individual needs mental \nhealth care or whether an individual’s mental state is within normal limits. Defendant Hayden’s \nlay opinion effectively ended DWCC’s early inquiry into Mr. Tellis’s mental state in 2008. \nAnthony Tellis never received any further evaluation or follow-up from a licensed mental health \nprofessional. \n118.  Nearly three months later, on January 13, 2009, Mr. Tellis received a visit from \nSteve Hayden. During that visit, Hayden noted that Mr. Tellis made no mental health complaints. \nMr. Tellis did not raise any mental health concerns at that time because he was afraid Hayden \nwould keep him in extended lockdown longer if he raised the mental health issues again. This \n                                                 \n2 The DPS&C categorizes prisoners into five LOC groups, with LOC 1 for the individuals with the most serious \nmental health needs and LOC 5 for individuals with no significant mental health needs. \n24 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 1   Filed 02/20/18   Page 25 of 53 PageID #:  25\nfear was rooted in the fact that DWCC has no mental health unit and that individuals with mental \nillness are often kept indefinitely in extended lockdown. \n119.  Mr. Tellis had no disciplinary record at that time and was only being held in \nextended lockdown pending initial his classification for housing in the general population. Mr. \nTellis received another follow up segregation interview on March 4, 2009 before being released \ninto the general population. \n120.  On December 15, 2009, Mr. Tellis again requested mental health services for \naddiction,  anger  management,  and  parenting  in  writing.  In  general  population,  Mr.  Tellis \nreceived anger management and family group counseling, but no individual counseling.  \n121.  On February 12, 2016, Mr. Tellis assaulted another prisoner. The other prisoner \ndied from pneumonia following injuries from that fight. Mr. Tellis was placed on strip cell \nsubsequent to that altercation. \n122.  On February 18, 2016, Defendant Seal met with Mr. Tellis. In a meeting that \nlasted less than ten minutes, he received no diagnosis.   \n123.  On April 21, 2016, Mr. Tellis was diagnosed with “mood disorder, not otherwise \nspecified”  and  prescribed  Celexa,  a  selective  serotonin  reuptake  inhibitor  used  to  treat \ndepression. \n124.  On November 3, 2016, Mr. Tellis was placed on suicide watch. His existing \nmental health problems had reached a crisis. He remained on suicide watch for approximately 24 \nhours. \n125.  Mr. Tellis has remained on extended lockdown since February 2016.  \n126.  Mr. Tellis currently complains of auditory and visual hallucinations. \n25 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 1   Filed 02/20/18   Page 26 of 53 PageID #:  26\n127.  Mr. Tellis’ situation demonstrates that Defendants do not follow-up on initial \ndiagnostic screenings, and do not provide any counseling or therapy in extended lockdown \nregardless of circumstances, and the severe psychological consequences of prolonged solitary \nconfinement and lockdown. \n  ii.   Plaintiff Bruce Charles \n128.  Plaintiff Bruce Charles was processed into DPS&C custody on February 20, \n2013.  \n129.  On June 2, 2016, he arrived in extended lockdown at DWCC on transfer from \nAllen Correctional Center. \n130.  On June 6, 2016, Mr. Charles received cursory and contradictory intake and \nreview screenings.  \n131.  First, on June 6, 2016, Defendant Hayden completed a “Mental Health Intake \nScreening” for Mr. Charles. Hayden marked that his mood, affect, and thought process were \nwithin normal limits. He noted that Mr. Charles denied any current symptoms, suicidal ideation, \ntreatment, or psychotropic medications. He wrote that “prior treatment” was “none.”  \n132.  The DOC records for Mr. Charles prior to this date show, conversely, that Mr. \nCharles reported a diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder dating back to 2001, has been prescribed \npsychotropic medications since the age of 12, was prescribed Depakote while incarcerated, had \ntreatment plans citing mood instability and depressed mood, and had been placed on mental \nhealth observation several times.  \n133.  Also on June 6, 2016, Defendant Hayden completed a “Level of Care Review” for \nMr. Charles. Under “Axis I diagnosis” he circled “none indicated.” Under “Diagnosis” in the \n“Severe Mental Illness” section, he checked “Bipolar Disorder” and entered a diagnosis date of \n26 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 1   Filed 02/20/18   Page 27 of 53 PageID #:  27\nDecember 10, 2013. He assigned Mr. Charles to LOC 5h. LOC 5 indicates no current mental \nillness, and the modifier “h” indicates a history of mental illness.  \n134.  On June 9, 2016, Mr. Charles saw Defendant Seal for the first time in psychiatric \nclinic.  Defendant  Seal  noted  that  Mr.  Charles  was  not  currently  receiving  medication,  but \npreviously received Valproic acid, Seroquel, Zyprexa, and Risperdal. Mr. Charles reported that \nhe was struggling with sleep. Seal noted Mr. Charles’ mood to be fair, and his affect to be \nflattened. Seal diagnosed Mr. Charles as having Bipolar I and prescribed Depakote, with the \nmedication level to be checked in two weeks.  \n135.  The clinic assessment form documents that Mr. Charles would be scheduled for \nhis next psychiatric clinic in 4-6 months.  \n136.  On the same day, June 9, 2016, another Level of Care Review form was filled out, \nreassigning Mr. Charles from LOC 5 to LOC 3. Under Defendants’ policies, Mr. Charles would \nnot anticipate another encounter with mental health staff for the next 30 days at least, despite the \nfact that he was starting a potent psychotropic medication.  \n137.   On June 12, 2016, within three days of the Level of Care Review, Mr. Charles \nwas placed on extreme suicide watch after he tied a sheet around his neck in an attempt to hang \nhimself. \n138.  Defendant  Assistant  Warden  Dauzat  documented  the  attempted  hanging  in  a \n“Progress Note” but did not enter information for any of the 17 indicators of mental status. Mr. \nCharles was placed on extreme suicide watch following the attempt, and was downgraded to \nstandard suicide watch the next day.  \n139.  On June 14, 2016, Steve Hayden completed a “Progress Note” while visiting Mr. \nCharles on suicide watch. Hayden marked that his affect and mood were angry, his thought \n27 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 1   Filed 02/20/18   Page 28 of 53 PageID #:  28\ncontent was suicidal, his judgment was poor, his attitude was demanding, his behavior was \naggressive, and he had suicidal ideations. Hayden noted that Mr. Charles had a plan to harm \nhimself and begin a hunger strike.  \n140.  On the same day, June 14, 2016, Defendant Adkins also completed a “Progress \nNote” while visiting Mr. Charles. Adkins marked that his mood was normal, his affect was mood \ncongruent, his thought content was normal, his thought process was logical, his judgment was \nnormal, his attitude was cooperative, his behavior was normal, and he showed no significant risk \nof suicide. Defendant Adkins noted that Mr. Charles appeared in good spirits, and did not \ncomplain or try to persuade.  \n141.  On June 14, 2016, two days after Defendant Dauzat wrote a note documenting \nMr.  Charles’  suicide  attempt,  Defendant  Dauzat  signed  his  intake  screening.  This  intake \nscreening showed his level of care as 5h, no Axis I diagnosis, no suicidal ideation, no symptoms, \nno history of treatment, and no current treatment. Her signature follows the statements “The \ninitial  screening  data  have  been  reviewed,  and  needs  for  additional  screening  or \nassessment/consultation, if any, are documented in Section C”, and “Plan: Follow up per policy”. \nThere are no additional notes following this statement of review. Mr. Charles was still on suicide \nwatch when that document was signed. \n142.  On June 17, 2016, Defendant Hayden completed notes stating that Mr. Charles \nstill  had  suicidal  ideations  and  threatened  self-harm.  On  June  17,  2016,  Defendant  Adkins \ncompleted a note stating that Mr. Charles had clear thinking and felt better, and that “other than \nthe heat, all was well”.  \n143.  There is no documentation that Mr. Charles had any encounters with mental \nhealth staff on June 18 or June 19, while he remained on suicide watch.  \n28 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 1   Filed 02/20/18   Page 29 of 53 PageID #:  29\n144.  On June 20, 2016, Defendant Hayden noted that Mr. Charles had no suicidal \nideations or plans to self-harm, and released him from suicide watch. None of the documents \ncreated during this period record any diagnostic batteries, inventories, assessments, or instances \nof staff talking with Mr. Charles about psychosocial factors, support systems, his adjustment to \nmedication, his adjustment to a new environment, coping mechanisms, recognizing risk factors, \nor treatment options.  \n145.  Two weeks later, on July 4, 2016, Mr. Charles again reported suicidal ideations \nand was again placed on suicide watch. There is no documentation that Mr. Charles was seen on \nJuly 5. On July 6, 2016, Mr. Charles tied a sheet around his neck to attempt suicide. He was \nagain placed on suicide watch, and remained on watch until July 11, 2016. He received a \nsegregation interview on July 28. He was not seen again by mental health until October 10. \n146.  This  tangle  of  self-contradictory  progress  notes,  bungled  intake  process,  and \nsuicide watch is the clearly foreseeable result of Defendants’ policies and lack of planning and \navailable mental health resources.  \n147.  This pattern has continued since Mr. Charles arrived in extended cell confinement \nat DWCC with diagnosis of bipolar disorder.  He has since been on suicide watch five times, \nstripped belongings and mattress, clothed only in a short paper gown. He is not directly observed \nduring this time period. Twice, Mr. Charles has been placed on “extreme suicide watch” for \nattempted suicide, meaning he was chained and clothed only in a paper gown in his cell without \naccess to any stimuli or people.  The duration of Mr. Charles’ confinement in extended lockdown \nhas caused his health to deteriorate such that he consistently presents a danger to himself. \n148.  Mr. Charles is currently categorized as LOC 3 by the DPS&C. \n29 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 1   Filed 02/20/18   Page 30 of 53 PageID #:  30\n149.  The DPS&C defines LOC 3 as follows: “LOC 3 shall be assigned to offenders \nwith SMI (“serious mental illness”) and who have been in remission or have been stable for at \nleast six months. These offenders may live in the general housing areas. A SMI diagnosis is \ntypically chronic in nature and the offender will most likely remain diagnosed with SMI for the \nremainder of the offender's life. If they are stable, functional and have no major problem with \ncompliance then they should be designated as LOC 3.” \n150.  Mr. Charles’ condition routinely manifests as self-injurious or suicidal thoughts \nand actions. Because of the lack of screening and treatment, he is simply maintained on extended \nlockdown or suicide watch until the crisis manifestations of the chronic mental illness passes and \nhe temporarily recompensates.   \n151.  Mr. Charles’ diagnoses and behaviors are mismatched with his classification as \nLOC 3. His chronic mental illness has manifested repeatedly as suicidal behavior.  \n152.  Mr. Charles started Depakote, a trade name for valproic acid, in June of 2016. In \nMarch of 2017, Defendant Seal noted that he was “still only sporadically compliant”, determined \nby VPA levels in his system. Charles has no medication refusal forms in his record from this \ntime, and was never written up for having excess medication during shakedowns. If the Depakote \nwas not refused, not in his system, and not in his cell, it stands to reason that the medication was \nnot correctly dosed or delivered. There is no attempt by the Defendants to reconcile this serious \nmedication discrepancy.  \n153.  Mr. Charles reported suicidal ideations on April 12, 2017.  He was seen by the \nnurse on duty and told that because no mental health staff were available at the time, he would be \ntransferred to suicide watch. Mr. Charles did not want to move to suicide watch due to the harsh \nconditions. Staff informed him that if he refused suicide watch, he would receive a prison \n30 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 1   Filed 02/20/18   Page 31 of 53 PageID #:  31\ndisciplinary  charge  of  malingering.  Mr.  Charles  chose  to  accept  a  malingering  charge  and \nreceived a disciplinary action rather than being transferred indefinitely to suicide watch.  \n154.  On May 26, 2017, Mr. Charles again became suicidal due to deaths in his family.  \nHe was transferred to suicide watch. The prison stripped him of his clothes, gave him a paper \ngown and took away all of his possessions.  He received no mental health services to help him to \ncope with his loss or deal with the symptoms of his mental illness during that difficult time. \n155.  In June of 2017, Mr. Charles learned that another of his brothers had just died. In \nprotest against the absence of mental health services available to help him cope with his recent \nlosses, Mr. Charles went on hunger strike on July 7, 2017. Defendants placed Mr. Charles on \nsuicide watch due to his hunger strike. His family tried to visit him during this time and was \ndenied.   \n156.  Mr. Charles’ existing mental illness was greatly exacerbated due to Defendants’ \nuse of extreme isolation from family support and the absence of mental health staff to help deal \nwith his loss. \n157.  Mr. Charles has frequently been placed on suicide watch since his arrival at \nDWCC. No additional mental health diagnostics or screenings have been given to him despite \nhis reoccurring suicidal ideations. \n158.  This series of events clearly illustrates several of Defendants’ problematic policies \nand practices: (1) repeated use of suicide watch does not trigger any alarm bells that a prisoner’s \nmental health condition is not being effectively treated, (2) prisoners so dangerously unstable \nthat they require suicide watch are still considered to be sufficiently “in remission or stable” for \nthe purposes of level of care classification, (3) prisoners with known serious and chronic mental \nillnesses are placed in extended lockdown, (4) even as evidence of a serious mental illness \n31 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 1   Filed 02/20/18   Page 32 of 53 PageID #:  32\nmounts, there is no process for reconsidering whether extended lockdown is an appropriate \nsetting for treatment, and (5) Defendants apply the same schedule for mental health visits to all \nprisoners regardless of individual needs. \n  b.  Defendants’ Policies and Practices Harmed and Continue to Harm the Class  \n    Members. \n \n159.  The named Plaintiffs seek to represent the hundreds of men at risk of serious harm \nthrough Defendants’ policies. As illustrated by the following examples, the experiences of the \nmen at DWCC sadly follow the common experiences of Mr. Tellis and Mr. Charles, and those \nsystemic failures alleged in this Complaint.  \n  i.   Matthew Carroll  \n160.  Matthew Carroll has a history of mental health diagnoses and medication reaching \nback to age eight. While at Elayn Hunt Correctional Center, Mr. Carroll attempted suicide by \nswallowing a razor blade. On August 17, 2015, Mr. Carroll was transferred from EHCC to \nDWCC. Despite the record of those facts available to Defendants upon his arrival at DWCC, he \nreceived no mental health medication for one month following his transfer to DWCC. \n161.  Mr. Carroll received a diagnosis of Depression NOS (“Not Otherwise Specified”) \nupon his arrival at DWCC despite having received a diagnosis of intermittent explosive disorder \nand antisocial personality disorder on July 23, 2015 at EHCC.  Additionally, there are a number \nof notes documented while he was at EHCC that indicate psychotic features to his mental illness \nthat are not indicated in the documentation while he has been at DWCC.  \n162.  Mr. Carroll has a documented history of suicidal ideation and attempts since his \nincarceration, even prior to arriving at DWCC.  Upon his arrival at DWCC, he was placed on \nextended lockdown and has not left.  Mr. Carroll continues to go through cycles of suicidal \n32 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 1   Filed 02/20/18   Page 33 of 53 PageID #:  33\nideation  and  attempts  while  on  extended  lockdown  resulting  from  a  lack  of  treatment  and \nadequate response to requests for help and intervention for a mental health crisis.   \n163.  Mr. Carroll made a suicide attempt on September 22, 2017 in plain view of staff \non  the  tier  by  swallowing  a  handful  of  pills.    The  staff  ignored  Mr.  Carroll  and  did  not \nimmediately intervene to prevent the attempt or to provide immediate medical treatment until \nafter the shift change, between fifteen minutes and half an hour later.   \n164.  Following that attempt, Mr. Carroll was moved to EHCC for reasons unrelated to \nhis mental health. He was returned to DWCC shortly thereafter without any additional treatment \nplanning or diagnostics. \n165.  Following his return to DWCC, Mr. Carroll again attempted suicide by overdose \non or around January 16, 2018 and spent several days on suicide watch.  \n166.  Mr.  Carroll  was  placed  on  suicide  watch  following  his  attempt  but  was  not \nprovided with any therapy or assessments and did not speak with Defendant Seal. Mr. Carroll is \ncategorized as LOC 4, indicating mental illness that is not serious.  Since his arrival at DWCC \nhis diagnosis has been Depression NOS.  This diagnosis and level of care classification is not \nconsistent with his history of mental health treatment since the age of 8 or his persistent suicidal \nideation and behavior. \n  ii.  Prisoner AA \n167.  Prisoner AA is a man with significant mental illness who was held in extended \nlockdown and solitary confinement for an extended period at DWCC. During that period of time, \nhis mental illness deteriorated significantly.  \n168.  Prisoner AA wrote a sick call on February 17, 2016. He was not on DWCC’s \nmental health caseload at that time, despite having reported a history of major depression, and \n33 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 1   Filed 02/20/18   Page 34 of 53 PageID #:  34\nbeing documented as being disoriented, talking to himself, showing bizarre behavior, and having \nan inappropriate affect. The sick call requested help for depression, “heart hurting,” and trauma \nto head when he thinks or speaks too loud.  \n169.  The responder wrote that Prisoner AA was referred to mental health. No mental \nhealth assessment or treatment occurred.  \n170.  On September 27, 2016, Prisoner AA filled out another sick call using incomplete \nsentences, including “Mental, Mind, Brain, Depression. Feeling like my Brain getting strip out \nhead…No Sleep only eyes close…need medication for Depression Direct head attack”. The \nresponder’s assessment was “no suicidal thoughts expressed” and notified mental health.  \n171.  He  was  seen  a  month  later,  on  October  28,  2016,  when  Defendant  Aerial \nRobinson reported “rapid speech and bizarre thought content”, and ordered a psychological \nconsultation. On October 31, 2016, Prisoner AA had a segregation interview, the only form of \nmental health monitoring for prisoners without a diagnosis, and Steve Hayden wrote that he was \n“doing well” and denied any mental health concerns.  \n172.  Prisoner AA was seen by Defendant Seal on November 17, 2016, where he \nreported  depression,  and  requested  Cannabis  and  Ultram,  then  Wellbutrin.  Seal  noted  that \nPrisoner  AA  “didn’t  want  me  to  use  my  medical  judgment”,  he  was  irritable,  with  a \ncircumstantial thought process, but Defendant Seal made no diagnosis of any underlying mental \nhealth condition. Prisoner AA was reaffirmed as LOC 5 in December 2016.  \n173.  On January 3, 2017, Prisoner AA wrote another sick call with illogical language, \nincluding “head inside out need brain scan…having out space problem Aliens!” The responder \nnoted that he complained of space aliens invading his body, and referred to mental health. No \nmental health treatment or evaluation was given.  \n34 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 1   Filed 02/20/18   Page 35 of 53 PageID #:  35\n174.  Prisoner AA wrote a similar sick call on January 5, 2017, noting “trauma to whole \nBrain having problems Body Reality missing”. The responder noted “no medical issues” and \nnotified mental health. No mental health treatment was given.  \n175.  Prisoner AA was seen for a compulsory segregation interview on January 25, \n2017 by Steve Hayden. Hayden noted that Prisoner AA participated in casual conversation and \nreported no mental health concerns.  \n176.  Prisoner AA wrote a nonsensical sick call on March 8, 2017, and the responder \nwrote “unable to determine any specific medical problem” and determined “No tx [treatment] \nneeded”.  \n177.  On April 20, 2017, nurse Michelle Norris emailed Steve Hayden to request mental \nhealth contact because “Offender has rambling speech, flight of ideas.” Hayden responded seven \ndays later, stating that Prisoner AA had already been seen by Defendant Seal and “is seen per \npolicy by mental health”. As a LOC 5, Prisoner AA would only receive a segregation interview \nevery 90 days, per policy.  \n178.  On April 21, 2017, Prisoner AA wrote another sick call that was still nonsensical \nand nearly illegible. The responder noted rambling speech and that Prisoner AA moved all \nextremities with extreme difficulty, and that he had last seen mental health on November 17, \n2016. The responder again referred to mental health. A different writer added a note “make sure \nand reviews these sick call requests”. No mental health treatment was given.  \n179.  On  May  12,  2017,  Prisoner  AA  wrote  yet  another  rambling  sick  call  with \nreferences to the bible and the FBI. The responder noted multiple random complaints, and no \ntreatment  needed.  Hayden  again  documented  a  segregation  interview,  according  the  note, \n35 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 1   Filed 02/20/18   Page 36 of 53 PageID #:  36\nPrisoner AA allegedly participated in conversation and had no complaints, with no apparent \n“acute distress.”  \n180.  Prisoner AA’s level of care was reviewed on May 25, 2017, and changed from 5 \nto 5h. Another segregation interview was completed by Aerial Robinson on May 26, 2017, who \nfound that Prisoner AA was delusional with rapid, pressured speech, and had a preoccupation \nwith conspiracy theories. She referred for psych consult and would “follow up per policy.”  \n181.  Prisoner AA, still without any mental health treatment, wrote another illogical \nsick call on June 14, 2017. The responder noted rambling speech and difficulty moving limbs, \nbut also noted that he had already been referred to mental health on April 20, 2017.  \n182.  On August 24, 2017, months after staff documented their concerns about Prisoner \nAA’s mental status, Defendant Seal saw him again at clinic. Defendant Seal noted that staff \nreported that he seemed manic, talked about “the government,” and worked on blank sheets of \npaper as if he were writing on them. Prisoner AA again asked for Wellbutrin and Ultram, and \nrefused other medication because “he’s worried ‘they will make me crazy.’”  \n183.  Seal recorded that Prisoner AA was hyper-verbal, tangential, and having auditory \nhallucinations, and diagnosed him with Bipolar I.  \n184.  Prisoner AA’s pleas for help resulted only in Defendants’ creation of inadequate, \nself-contradictory reports, often made by staff unlicensed to provide mental health observations \nand assessments. These reporting problems result in his severe mental illness being ignored and \nunderdiagnosed, left to further destabilize and fall deeper into paranoia and delusions.  \n185.  Months  dragged  on  and  more  than  a  year  passed,  with  sick  calls  and  notes \nindicating progressively worse deterioration in expressive ability and clarity of thought. Each \nsick call and clinical visit should have led to the obvious conclusion that Prisoner AA suffers \n36 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 1   Filed 02/20/18   Page 37 of 53 PageID #:  37\nfrom severe mental illness. Defendants did not transfer Prisoner AA to EHCC for mental health \nevaluation and treatment until late 2017. \n  iii.  Carlton Turner \n186.  Carlton Turner has a diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder. In January and June of 2016, \nDefendant  Seal  had  diagnosed  Mr.  Turner  with  only  Major  Depression,  although  he  was \nprescribed both an antipsychotic and an antidepressant. On August 12, 2016, around 8:30AM, \nstaff found Mr. Turner sitting on the floor bleeding due to having cut his own scrotum. He was \ntreated in the infirmary, and visited by Defendant Assistant Warden Dauzat, who noted that he \nrefused to converse. He was ordered into the restraint chair on Extreme Suicide Watch.  \n187.  After 10 hours, Mr. Turner was downgraded to alternative restraints by verbal \norder,  after  nursing  reported  that  he  was  calm  and  not  attempting  to  remove  stitches.  He \nremained in a camera cell, with continued orders to be checked every 15 minutes and at random. \nLieutenant Gary Carter recorded on a suicide watch log that he checked on Mr. Turner at \n10:10AM, and Mr. Turner was laying on his bunk. Lt. Carter completed an unusual incident \nreport stating that, at 10:25AM, he was passing out cups and sporks for mealtime, when he \nobserved Mr. Turner, who was bleeding from his right wrist with a puddle of blood on the floor.  \n188.  Upon receiving a call from nursing that Mr. Turner had cut himself, Defendant \nDauzat again verbally ordered him into the restraint chair. Mr. Turner was again downgraded to \nalternative restraints after 10 hours in the restraint chair, because he had conversed with nursing \nstaff and hadn’t expressed a current intent to harm himself. The following morning, Mr. Turner \nremained  on  Extreme  Suicide  Watch  with  15-minute  observations.  Lieutenant  Gary  Carter \nlogged that he checked on Turner at 6:21AM, and Mr. Turner was sleeping.  \n37 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 1   Filed 02/20/18   Page 38 of 53 PageID #:  38\n189.  Carter  completed  another  Unusual  Occurrence  Report  documenting  that,  four \nminutes later, at 6:25AM, Carter had been passing out cups and sporks when he observed Mr. \nTurner with arms outstretched and blood dripping from his left wrist. Medical was called after \nMr. Turner was escorted to the lobby in full restraints, and he was treated. Defendant Dauzat was \nthen called, and for a third time she verbally ordered Mr. Turner, now with wounds on both \nwrists and his genitals, to be strapped to a chair.  \n190.  At evening shift change 12 hours later, Defendant Dauzat documented that, with \nverbal  concurrence  by  a  staff  physician,  Dr.  Fuller,  due  to  his  self-harm  and  lack  of \ncommunication with staff, he would be left in the restraint chair, while mental health staff went \nhome for the night. The following morning, while Mr. Turner was allowed a break from the chair \nand lay in his cell in other restraints, he repeatedly hit his head against the bunk, causing a \nbloody wound. He refused to converse when visited by Defendant Hayden. This was the first \ntime mental health staff attempted to see or speak with him in three days, after he had spent over \n40 hours with his limbs strapped to a chair and intentionally injured himself four times.  \n191.  Mr. Turner was placed in a helmet and returned to the restraint chair. Hayden \nagain visited at 11:15AM, but Mr. Turner still refused conversation. Hayden observed “no \noutward aggression or attempts at self-injury”, although Mr. Turner was fully immobilized. He \nwas again downgraded to alternative restraints.  \n192.  Hayden visited again later, and alleged that Mr. Turner then reported that his self-\nharm was due to believing that he had been given a write-up, but had discovered that he had not \nreceived a write-up, and didn’t plan to harm himself. He was downgraded to Standard Suicide \nWatch, and released the next day.  \n38 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 1   Filed 02/20/18   Page 39 of 53 PageID #:  39\n193.  Mr.  Turner’s  escalating  suicide  attempts  did  not  prompt  any  mental  health \ntreatment, counseling, or assessment. None of these events triggered any actual diagnostics. \nSatisfied with the explanation that Mr. Turner was upset over a write-up, Defendants ignored the \nobvious evidence that underlying mental illness caused Mr. Turner to mutilate his genitals and \ncut his wrists. \n194.  On September 23, 2017, Mr. Turner attempted suicide on by making a 12-foot \njump over barbed wire and onto concrete. He documented clearly in writing that his plan to \ncommit suicide was due to insufficient mental health treatment, an inability to be transferred to a \nfacility with adequate mental health treatment, and retaliation for speaking with attorneys. He \nreceived a disciplinary write-up for “general disobedience” as a result of the incident. \n195.  While in the hospital, the psychiatric sections of his plan of care, for a span of \nonly three weeks, included 7 goals and 27 modes of intervention. He was seen daily by a \nlicensed psychiatrist and his medication was constantly monitored. The only change to his \nmental health care that followed him back to DWCC was a change in his medication to lithium. \n196.  Mr. Turner has now been returned to extended lockdown. He continues to require \nmultiple surgeries and faces the possibility of amputation of his leg due to injuries sustained in \nhis most recent suicide attempt.  \n  iv.  Terrence Goudeau \n197.  Terrence Goudeau, an individual with serious mental illnesses held on extended \nlockdown, frequently requested mental health evaluation and treatment from Defendants.  He \nnever received any such treatment.  He hanged himself in June 2016.  The death of Goudeau \nillustrates the serious harm that may come from the deliberate indifference of staff at DWCC to \nserious mental illness. \n39 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 1   Filed 02/20/18   Page 40 of 53 PageID #:  40\n  h.  Tyler Blanchard \n198.  Tyler Blanchard is a man who reports a history of Bipolar, PTSD, and OCD. His \nonly diagnosis given by Defendant Seal is Depression. Shortly before 1:00AM on September 16, \n2016, an officer making rounds noticed that Mr. Blanchard was bleeding from his left forearm. \nThe captain was notified, and Mr. Blanchard was placed in full restraints and escorted to the \nlobby, where a nurse cleaned his wounds.  \n199.  Defendant Assistant Warden Dauzat was contacted by the nurse, and verbally \nauthorized Extreme Suicide Watch with verbal concurrence from staff physician Dr. Fuller. \nDefendant Dauzat never saw or spoke to Mr. Blanchard, or offered any type of treatment. Mr. \nBlanchard was then returned to an observation cell while in full restraints. At about 2:45AM, the \nsame officer again noticed Mr. Blanchard bleeding from his arm. Mr. Blanchard was supposed to \nbe on 24-hr camera observation, but no one saw or prevented him from attempting suicide.  \n200.  Mr. Blanchard was again brought to the lobby in restraints to have his wounds \ncleaned. Defendant Dauzat was again called, and she directed that Mr. Blanchard be strapped to \nthe restraint chair, again without seeing him, speaking to him, or offering any type of mental \nhealth treatment to a man who attempted suicide twice in a span of two hours. At 4:03AM, the \nsame officer, while making rounds, noticed that Mr. Blanchard was banging his head against the \nwall. While still on 24-hour camera observation for two consecutive suicide attempts, no other \nstaff noticed his active self-harm.  \n201.  Mr. Blanchard was then wheeled to the lobby, still strapped to the restraint chair, \nwhere a helmet was placed on his head at the authorization of Defendant Dauzat, and he was \nreturned to the cell. Mr. Blanchard was still not given any therapeutic intervention despite doing \neverything within his ability to harm himself.  \n40 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 1   Filed 02/20/18   Page 41 of 53 PageID #:  41\n202.  Later that day, Defendant Adkins, acting as chaplain, visited Mr. Blanchard. \nDuring that visit, Adkins noted that Mr. Blanchard, who had each of his limbs strapped to a \nchair, able to move only his neck, and had been kept there for several hours, was “not readily \ntalkative”. After 12 hours immobilized in the restraint chair, Mr. Blanchard was released by a \nnurse, and downgraded to Standard Suicide Watch.  \n203.  Because it was the weekend, Mr. Blanchard did not see a mental health staff \nmember for another three days. For the three subsequent days, Mr. Blanchard reported thoughts \nof self-harm and suicide, without any therapeutic intervention. On the fourth day, he did not \nreport such thoughts, and was released. Mr. Blanchard spent 32 days on suicide watch during \n2016, and cut himself 5 times.  \n204.  He received no counseling or treatment other than Wellbutrin.  \n205.  Mr. Blanchard reports that he cuts himself to relieve pain and stress, because there \nis no other treatment provided. Mr. Blanchard reports that he continues to harm himself, often by \npunching  his  cell  walls  until  his  hands  become  injured.  Defendants’  only  response  to  this \nbehavior is to threaten him with chemical restraints unless he stops the behavior.  \n206.  Mr. Blanchard states that he would like therapy or counseling to understand why \nhe hurts himself and how to avoid handling his feelings that way. Developing that type of insight \ninto  his  behavioral  problems  is  not  achievable  only  through  medication  and  medication \nmanagement. \n207.  Following this incident, Defendants made no changes to Mr. Blanchard’s mental \nhealth care treatment plan, and provided no counseling or other interventions. Mr. Blanchard \nremains on extended lockdown at DWCC. \n41 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 1   Filed 02/20/18   Page 42 of 53 PageID #:  42\n208.  Defendants  are  deliberately  indifferent  to  the  risks  of  harm  to  which  they \nsubjected Mr. Tellis, Mr. Charles, Mr. Carroll, Mr. Turner, Prisoner AA, and Mr. Blanchard. \nE.  Defendants Respond Brutally to Symptoms of Mental Illness, Requests for Mental \nHealth Treatment, and Attempts to Redress Grievances \n \n209.   There is a culture of cover-up and excessive force at David Wade, including \nexcessive use of chemical agents and force on prisoners with serious mental illness. This culture \nis established and tolerated by each of the named Defendants to this litigation.  \n210.  Prisoners reporting serious mental illness for themselves or others are threatened \nand receive serious disciplinary punishment, including Policy 34 and isolation. \n211.  Defendants have warned Mr. Charles and several putative Class members that \ntheir continued participation in the investigation of mental health conditions at DWCC would \nlead to retaliation. Defendants have offered promises of putting in a “good word” toward a \ntransfer to another facility in exchange for individual cooperation to cease participating in the \ninvestigation.  \n212.  A significant portion of individuals that undersigned counsel has met with over \nthe course of responding to complaints about conditions at DWCC have intentionally been \nmoved out of the prison. This includes many individuals with significant mental illness who \nwere moved to acute care units elsewhere in the DPS&C. \nF.  Defendants Systematically Deny Plaintiffs Delivery of Mail to and from Counsel. \n \n213.  Defendants interfere with counsels’ ability to collect facts and discern legally \nrelevant conditions at DWCC by intentionally denying prisoners the ability to send letters to the \nAdvocacy Center and MacArthur Justice Center. \n214.  The volume of correspondence that prisoners have sent to the Advocacy Center \nand  MacArthur  Justice  Center  but  which  never  arrived  demonstrates  a  clear  pattern  of \n42 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 1   Filed 02/20/18   Page 43 of 53 PageID #:  43\ninterference  directed  at  deliberately  and  systematically  preventing  correspondence  between \nPlaintiffs and their counsel. \n215.  There is no legitimate penological interest in destroying or misplacing mail to \ncounsel.  \n216.  Plaintiffs’ correspondence with counsel in this case is related to non-frivolous \nclaims under the Constitution and federal law.  \n217.  Defendants  additionally  have  a  policy  of  seizing  documents  and  disciplining \nprisoners who bring legal documents to attorney visits if that document has another prisoner’s \nname on it. This practice intimidates potential witnesses, invades the attorney client privilege, \nand interferes with peoples’ access to information and the courts by prejudicing their ability to \ncommunicate with counsel. \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \nPLAINTIFF CLASS AND SUB-CLASS DEFINED \n218.  Plaintiffs bring this action under 42 U.S.C. §1983, for violations of the First and \nEighth Amendments to the United States Constitution on behalf of all prisoners currently held, or \nwho will in the future be held, in extended lockdown at DWCC in the N-1, N-2, N-3, and N-4 \nbuildings. \n219.  Plaintiffs also bring this action under the ADA and Section 504 on behalf of a \nsub-class of all prisoners with disabilities related to mental health, or who are perceived as \nhaving such disabilities, currently held, or who will in the future be held, in extended lockdown \nat DWCC in N-1, N-2, N-3, and N-4.  \n \n \n43 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 1   Filed 02/20/18   Page 44 of 53 PageID #:  44\nA.  The Class Satisfies the Elements of Fed. R. Civ. P. 23 \n  1.  Numerosity \n220.  The members of the class are too numerous and fluid to be joined as individual \nparties to this litigation.  \n221.  The South Compound is comprised of five buildings, N-1 through N-5. Buildings \nN-1 through N-4 are “extended lockdown” units subject to this litigation. In each of the buildings \nthere are four tiers.  On each tier are 16 cells, some of which are individual cells and some of \nwhich are doubled.  In each of the four buildings, there are 64 cells.  At a maximum, if each cell \non a building houses double cells there are 128 individuals in the building.  At a given time, there \ncould be upwards of 500 individuals being housed in the South Compound. \n222.  According to a report issued in 2017 by the Department of Justice’s Bureau of \nJustice Statistics, 37% of prison inmates have a mental health diagnosis.3 That same report \nindicated  that  during  any  given  30-day  period,  approximately  14%  of  prison  inmates  are \nexperiencing  “serious  psychological  distress”  according  to  the  criteria  of  the  study’s \nmethodology.4 \n223.  The number of individuals housed on lockdown at DWCC with mental illness is \nsignificantly higher than these national statistics because of the practices of the Defendants, \noutlined above, which utilize the extended lockdown compound as a substitute mental health unit \nthat in turn creates and exacerbates mental illness.  \n224.  Joinder of the individuals in this Class is impracticable because prisoners are \nroutinely transferred in and out of DWCC as well as transferred between general population and \n                                                 \n3 Department of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics, Indicators of Mental Health Problems Reported by Prisoners \nand Jail Inmates, 2011-12 (2017) http://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=pbdetail&iid=5946 (last visited December 4, \n2017) \n \n4 Id. \n44 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 1   Filed 02/20/18   Page 45 of 53 PageID #:  45\nextended  lockdown.    Regardless  of  the  duration  of  time  an  individual  may  be  housed  on \nextended  lockdown  before  transferring  out,  he  is  still  forced  to  endure  the  inhumane  and \nunlawful conditions cultivated by the Defendants.   \n225.  This Class also contains future members.  \n226.  The sheer number of affected individuals, the fluidity of the Class members, and \nthe  fact  that  the  proposed  Class  contains  future  members  all  militate  toward  a  finding  of \nnumerosity.  \n  2.  Commonality \n227.  The violations of the Eighth Amendment, ADA, and Section 504 alleged herein \nare caused by the policies and systemic practices of the Defendants.  \n228.  Each prisoner held in extended lockdown is harmed by the brutal and inhumane \nconditions inflicted on prisoners in extended lockdown. Every individual housed in DWCC’s \nlockdown  units  is  subjected  to  the  Defendants’  deliberate  indifference  to  unconstitutional \nconditions of confinement and is exposed to the risk of serious mental illness or self-harm.  \n229.  Each  individual  on  extended  lockdown,  and  especially  those  in  solitary \nconfinement, is placed at extreme risk of developing a mental illness due to Defendants’ policies, \npractices and procedures. \n230.  Each claim shares a common core of fact and law: First, there is the factual \nquestion of Defendants’ implementation of the policies and practices as described herein. The \nquestions of fact and law as to whether those policies create an objective risk of serious harm are \nalso shared across the entire Class, regardless of whether each individual Class member exposed \nto the risk developed symptoms. And, finally, the entire Class shares the common question of \n45 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 1   Filed 02/20/18   Page 46 of 53 PageID #:  46\nwhether Defendants’ subjective intent in carrying out these policies was deliberately indifferent \nto the risks. \n  3.  Typicality \n231.  Bruce Charles and Anthony Tellis are both typical members of the Class.  \n232.  Plaintiffs  reallege  the  facts  above  to  show  that  they  have  all  been  failed  by \nDefendants’ system of care, subjected to brutal conditions, and suffered grievous harm. \n233.  The inadequacies of initial screening have harmed Plaintiffs Charles and Tellis. \nPlaintiffs Tellis and Charles were both exposed to significant risks due to failure to identify \nsignificant mental illness. Defendants placed Mr. Tellis extended lockdown without any mental \nhealth services despite indicators of mental illness from his intake at EHCC. Paragraphs 114-\n119.  Mr. Charles was categorized as having no significant mental illness despite having a \ndiagnosis of bipolar disorder and being on suicide watch at the time of his evaluation. Paragraphs \n128-37. \n234.  Requests for mental health treatment and reports of mental health crisis by both \nnamed Plaintiffs were met with little to no response. Paragraphs 115 and 153. \n235.  Following  placement  on  suicide  watch,  neither  named  Plaintiff  received  any \nadditional screenings, diagnostics, or other mental health care as a result of their heightened risk \nof self-harm. \n236.  Like all prisoners on extended lockdown at DWCC, named Plaintiffs are not \nprovided access to counseling, group therapy, or support groups. Any communications with \nDefendant Seal are not confidential and do not promote communication of issues relating to \nmental  illness.    Plaintiffs  are  not  provided  with  individualized  treatment  plans  and  goals.  \n46 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 1   Filed 02/20/18   Page 47 of 53 PageID #:  47\nPlaintiffs Tellis and Charles receive the same treatment plan with the same generalized goals that \nare not tailored to address issues relating to mental illness. Paragraphs 78-84. \n237.  The named Plaintiffs are subjected to suicide watch and extreme suicide watch \nsimply because it is Defendants’ only available response to any mental health issue or crisis. \nParagraphs 124 and 153. \n238.  The  named  Plaintiffs  are  frequently  deprived  of  medications  used  to  treat \nsymptoms of mental illness or are provided medications that are ineffective at treating the \nsymptoms.  Mr. Charles was not provided with medications when he arrived at DWCC until at \nleast after June 9, 2016. After having been deprived of his medication for one week, Mr. Charles \nattempted suicide three days after restarting his medication. Paragraph 128-37. \n239.  Each individual class representative advances the same legal theories, claims, and \nevidence. \n240.  Each individual class representative is seeking the same relief from this Court. \n  4.  Adequacy \n241.  Named Plaintiffs Charles and Tellis are both capable of representing the interests \nof absentee class members.  \n242.  There is no conflict of interest between Plaintiffs and Class members and the \nrepresentatives have common interests with the unnamed members.  All claims of named and \nunnamed members rest upon the policies, procedures, and practices of Defendants as a whole, \nand as such apply to all individuals housed in extended lockdown. \n243.  Class counsel are all members in good standing with the Louisiana Bar and \nMiddle District of Louisiana. Counsel is experienced in the conduct of class action litigation and \nprison litigation.  \n47 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 1   Filed 02/20/18   Page 48 of 53 PageID #:  48\n244.  Class counsel has been conducting an investigation into conditions at DWCC for \nsome  time.    Counsel  successfully  litigated  against  the  officials  of  the  DPS&C  to  address \ncounsel’s access to the prisoners and facilities at DWCC in furtherance of that investigation and \nhave worked with the DPS&C and Defendants to address issues under that settlement agreement. \n245.  Counsel  from  the  Advocacy  Center  is  empowered  under  federal  law  and \nrecognized by the state of Louisiana as the state’s Protection and Advocacy group for individuals \nwith disabilities, including mental illness. The Advocacy Center’s statutory mandate is to protect \nthe human and civil rights of people with disabilities. \nB.  The Sub-Class Satisfies the Elements of Fed. R. Civ. P. 23 \n246.  Each named Plaintiff is a representative of the class as well as the sub-class. \n247.  Each named Plaintiff is a person with a disability, and therefore a member of the \nSub-Class. \n248.  The claims for the violation of the ADA and Section 504, like the claims for the \nviolation of the Eighth Amendment, are based on the allegation that Defendants have been \nviolating the law by following their policies and practices. \n249.  The request for certification of the sub-class is otherwise identical to the request \nfor certification of the Class. \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nA.  Violations of the Eighth Amendment (Cruel and Unusual Punishment)  \n \n250.  By their policies and practices described herein, Defendants deprive Plaintiffs of \ntheir constitutional right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment, protected by the Eighth \nAmendment to the Constitution.  \n48 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 1   Filed 02/20/18   Page 49 of 53 PageID #:  49\n251.  The practices outlined above subject Plaintiffs to a substantial risk of serious harm \nand injury.  \n252.  Defendants are aware of the risks of harm and are deliberately indifferent to those \nrisks.  \n253.  Housing prisoners in these conditions does not serve any legitimate penological \nneed.  \n254.  Defendants  deprive  Plaintiffs  of  basic  human  needs  and  violate  present  day \nconcepts of human dignity.  \n \nB.  Violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act  \n255.  Plaintiffs bring their claims for the violation of the ADA on behalf of the sub-\nclass of individuals in extended lockdown who have mental illness. \n256.  Plaintiffs have disabilities due to mental illness, which interfere with their major \nlife activities. \n257.  Plaintiffs’ needs qualify them to receive mental health care, including therapy and \ncounseling. \n258.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate all allegations above herein.   \n259.  The Defendants knowingly and consistently discriminate against prisoners with \nmental  disabilities  by  failing  to  provide  them  with  reasonable  accommodation  for  their \ndisabilities and punishing them for behavior that is a product of their disabilities.  \n260.  Defendants have further knowingly discriminated against persons with disabilities \nas the result of Defendants’ methods of administration of their solitary confinement, extended \nlockdown, and mental health programs. \n49 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 1   Filed 02/20/18   Page 50 of 53 PageID #:  50\n261.  By placing prisoners with mental illness in extended lockdown, Defendants have \ndenied  prisoners  with  mental  illness  the  benefits  of  the  facility’s  services,  programs,  and \nactivities, including education, programming, recreation, exercise, and mental health treatment \nand services, thus discriminating against persons on the basis of their disability.  \n262.  Discrimination against prisoners with mental illness occurs particularly because \nprisoners do not receive mental health services sufficient to counteract the effects that extended \nlockdown and other forms of punishment have on mentally ill prisoners, which is more severe \nthan the impact it has on prisoners who are not mentally ill.  \n263.  The Defendants discriminate against prisoners with serious mental illness on the \nbasis of their disabilities. The Defendants routinely warehouse prisoners with serious mental \nillness in solitary confinement, and disproportionately place prisoners with serious mental illness \nin extended lockdown and especially solitary confinement.  \n264.  By  placing  prisoners  with  serious  mental  illness  in  extended  lockdown  and \nimposing behavior management plans and other forms of punishment, the Defendants (a) failed \nto furnish reasonable accommodation to prisoners with disabilities, (b) punish prisoners with \nserious mental illnesses for disability-related conduct; and (c) deprive prisoners with mental \nillness of access to adequate mental health care.  \nC.  Violation of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 \n265.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate all allegations above herein.   \n266.  Plaintiffs qualify as individuals with disabilities as defined in Section 504 of the \nRehabilitation Act of 1973. They have mental impairments that substantially limit one or more \nmajor life activity, including but not limited to thinking, concentrating, interacting with others, \n50 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 1   Filed 02/20/18   Page 51 of 53 PageID #:  51\nand controlling their behavior. They have records of having such impairment or are regarded as \nhaving such an impairment.  \n267.  The  Defendants  discriminate  against  prisoners  with  disabilities  by  failing  to \nprovide reasonable accommodation for their disabilities.  \n268.  Defendants discriminate against prisoners with disabilities solely on the basis of \ntheir disabilities in violation of Section 504.  \n269.  In  placing  prisoners  with  serious  mental  illness  in  extended  lockdown  the \nDefendants  have  deprived  prisoners  with  mental  illness  from  the  benefits  of  the  facility’s \nservices, programs, and activities, including education, programming, recreation, exercise, and \nmental health services, thus discriminating against them on the basis of their disabilities.  \nD.  Violation of the First Amendment   \n270.  Defendants  have  taken  extraordinary  steps  to  interfere  with  counsel’s \ninvestigation of conditions at DWCC by systematically interfering with mail sent by prisoners to \ntheir counsel, by punishing prisoners for bringing documents to attorney-client visits, and by \nrefusing counsel the ability to provide written materials prisoners. \n271.  Defendants’  interference  with  Plaintiffs’  communication  with  counsel  and \nretaliation based on the content of privileged documents violates the First Amendment. \n  \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \n272.  Plaintiffs request this court grant them the following relief: \nA.  Declare that this suit is maintainable as a class action pursuant to Federal Rules of \nCivil Procedure 23(a) and (b)(2);  \nB.

The district court \nheld two trials—one on liability and the other on remedies—and concluded \nthat Defendants violated the Eighth Amendment, the Rehabilitation Act of \n1973, and the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”).  Although the \ndistrict court has yet to provide any remedy sought by Plaintiffs, the district \ncourt purported to close the case and enter a “Judgment.”  The district court \nalso entered a “Remedial Order” that contemplates further proceedings to \ndetermine ultimate relief.  This appeal followed, and we stayed the Remedial \nOrder.  \nIn their brief, Defendants asserted that we have appellate jurisdiction \nover the Judgment and Remedial Order pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291.  At \noral argument, Defendants suggested that our jurisdiction instead lies under \n28  U.S.C.  § 1292(a)(1).    Seeking  clarification,  we  ordered  supplemental \nbriefing on whether we have jurisdiction over Defendants’ appeal. \nHaving reviewed the record and the parties’ supplemental briefs, we \nconclude that the district court has not yet entered a final decision appealable \nunder 28 U.S.C. § 1291, nor has it entered an injunction appealable pursuant \nto 28 U.S.C. § 1292(a)(1).  We therefore DISMISS this appeal for lack of \njurisdiction and VACATE the stay of the Remedial Order.1 \n_____________________ \n1  The stay in this case will be vacated once the mandate is issued. \n2 \n\nCase: 23-30825      Document: 182-1     Page: 3     Date Filed: 02/12/2025\nNo. 23-30825 \nI \nWe briefly provide the relevant facts.  Plaintiffs are inmates at LSP.  \nThey filed this class action in 2015 against the warden of LSP, the Louisiana \nDepartment of Public Safety and Corrections, and others.  The district court \nbifurcated the action into liability and remedy phases.  After an eleven-day \nbench trial on liability, the district court found in a 124-page opinion (the \n“Liability Opinion”) that Defendants had been deliberately indifferent to the \ninmates’ serious medical needs in violation of the Eighth Amendment.  See \nLewis v. Cain (Lewis I), No. 3:15-CV-318, 2021 WL 1219988, at *59 (M.D. La. \nMar.  31,  2021).2    The  court  also  found  that  Defendants  violated  the \nRehabilitation Act and the ADA.  Id.  The district court then held a ten-day \ntrial on remedies and concluded, in a 104-page opinion dated November 6, \n2023 (the “Remedial Opinion”), that Plaintiffs had established entitlement \nto permanent injunctive relief.  See Lewis v. Cain (Lewis II), 701 F. Supp. 3d \n361, 441 (M.D. La. 2023).  The district court wrote that it “will enter \nPermanent Injunctive relief by separate order.”  Id. \nThe district court entered two other documents on November 6, \n2023.  One was the Remedial Order.  The Remedial Order said the district \ncourt would appoint three special masters to develop proposed “Remedial \nPlans” (a “Medical Care Remedial Plan” and an “ADA/RA Remedial \nPlan”)  and  monitor  the  plans’  implementation.    The  Remedial  Order \ndirected the parties to submit names of proposed special masters within \nthirty days.  It further directed the special masters, once appointed, to submit \nthe proposed Remedial Plans within a designated amount of time.  The \nRemedial Order lists seven subjects to be addressed by the Medical Care \n_____________________ \n2 On appeal, the caption of this case was changed from Lewis v. Cain to Parker v. \nHooper. \n3 \n\nCase: 23-30825      Document: 182-1     Page: 4     Date Filed: 02/12/2025\nNo. 23-30825 \nRemedial Plan and five to be addressed by the ADA/RA Remedial Plan, \neach tied to deficiencies identified in the Liability and Remedial Opinions.  \nThe district court said it would review the proposed Remedial Plans and \nenter orders “necessary and appropriate to effect remedies.”  The Remedial \nOrder also contemplated that LSP and the Department of Corrections would \nbe required to cooperate with the special masters by, among other things, \nallowing  the  special  masters  access  to  LSP,  access  to  “records  and \ndocuments  appropriate  and  necessary  for  their  tasks,”  and  “reasonable \naccess” to class members. \nThe other document was the “Judgment.”  The Judgment awards no \nrelief; it merely states that judgment “is hereby entered in favor of Class \nPlaintiffs” and “against Defendants.”  The district court purported to close \nthe case but said it would retain jurisdiction “over the procedures set forth” \nin the Remedial Order “and any issues pertaining thereto.”  Defendants \nappealed from the Remedial Order and Judgment. \nII \nWe have a duty to confirm our appellate jurisdiction, regardless of \nwhether the parties have raised the issue.  Castaneda v. Falcon, 166 F.3d 799, \n801  (5th  Cir.  1999)  (stating  that  this  court  “must  address”  appellate \njurisdiction, “sua sponte if necessary”).  Defendants initially invoked our \njurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291, which provides circuit courts \njurisdiction over “appeals from all final decisions of the district courts of the \nUnited States.”  At oral argument, however, Defendants suggested that our \njurisdiction instead lies under 28 U.S.C. § 1292(a)(1), which allows appeals \nfrom  interlocutory  orders  “granting,  continuing,  modifying,  refusing  or \ndissolving injunctions, or refusing to dissolve or modify injunctions.”  In \ntheir  supplemental  brief,  Defendants  return  to  arguing  that  appellate \n4 \n\nCase: 23-30825      Document: 182-1     Page: 5     Date Filed: 02/12/2025\nNo. 23-30825 \njurisdiction exists under § 1291, using § 1292(a)(1) as a backup.3  We discuss \nthese two potential bases for appellate jurisdiction in turn. \nA \nWe start with § 1291, under which “a final judgment is normally \ndeemed not to have occurred until there has been a decision by the District \nCourt that ends the litigation on the merits and leaves nothing for the court \nto do but execute the judgment.”  Midland Asphalt Corp. v. United States, 489 \nU.S. 794, 798 (1989) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  “A \nfinal decision is one by which a district court disassociates itself from a case.”  \nGelboim v. Bank of Am. Corp., 574 U.S. 405, 408 (2015) (internal quotation \nmarks and citation omitted).  The test for finality under § 1291 is “whether \nthe district court intended that its order be effective immediately.”  Ueckert \nv. Guerra, 38 F.4th 446, 450 (5th Cir. 2022) (internal quotation marks and \ncitation omitted).  “Said another way, a court’s ruling is only final if the judge \nintends to have nothing further to do—with the motion (if an interlocutory \nappeal) or the case (if a conventional appeal).”  Id. (internal quotation marks \nand citation omitted). \nHere,  there  is  no  final  decision  sufficient  to  create  appellate \njurisdiction under § 1291.  The Remedial Order makes plain that the district \ncourt did not “intend[] to have nothing further to do.”  Id. (citation omitted).  \nThe order expressly contemplates future district court action, providing that \nthe district court “will appoint three Special Masters to prepare proposed \nRemedial  Plans”  after  submission  by  the  parties  within  thirty  days  of \n“potential  Special  Masters  with  the  qualifications  set  forth  herein” \n_____________________ \n3 Plaintiffs’ supplemental brief argues that we lack appellate jurisdiction under \n§ 1291.  Plaintiffs do not discuss § 1292(a)(1), but Plaintiffs’ silence does not mean we must \naccept Defendants’ contentions regarding § 1292(a)(1).  See Castaneda, 166 F.3d at 801. \n5 \n\nCase: 23-30825      Document: 182-1     Page: 6     Date Filed: 02/12/2025\nNo. 23-30825 \n(emphasis added).  The Remedial Order also provides that the district court \n“will review the proposed Remedial Plans and any requests for amendment \nand  will  enter  Orders  necessary  and  appropriate  to  effect  remedies” \n(emphasis  added).    In  short,  the  district  court  has  certainly  not \n“disassociate[d] itself from [this] case.”  Gelboim, 574 U.S. at 408 (citation \nomitted); see also Ueckert, 38 F.4th at 450 (“[W]e noted . . . that a district \ncourt’s memorandum saying that a preliminary injunction will be issued did \nnot reflect the district court’s intent that the opinion act as an operable \njudgment.” (cleaned up)).   \nDefendants rely on the “Judgment” entered by the district court, but \nthey do not satisfactorily explain how that document, which awards no relief, \n“ends  the  litigation  on  the  merits.”   Midland Asphalt,  489  U.S.  at  798 \n(citation  omitted).    Purporting  to  close  the  case  in  a  document  labeled \n“Judgment” is insufficient to create appellate jurisdiction where it is clear \nthat the case is not actually finished and no substantive relief has been \nentered.  See Sears, Roebuck & Co. v. Mackey, 351 U.S. 427, 437 (1956) (“The \nDistrict Court cannot, in the exercise of its discretion, treat as ‘final’ that \nwhich is not ‘final’ within the meaning of § 1291.”); Hotard v. State Farm \nFire & Cas. Co., 286 F.3d 814, 816 (5th Cir. 2002) (same).  We thus conclude \nthat we lack appellate jurisdiction under § 1291.4 \n_____________________ \n4 We do not agree with Defendants’ arguments that there is “no other ‘final \ndecision’ in sight” and that they will thus be “indefinitely barred” from challenging on \nappeal the district court’s Liability Opinion.  The Remedial Order makes clear that the \ndistrict court “will review the proposed Remedial Plans and any requests for amendment \nand will enter Orders necessary and appropriate to effect remedies.”  In other words, once \nthe district court approves the Remedial Plans and thereby awards substantive relief, there \nwill be an appealable final decision, at which point Defendants can challenge that decision \nand any preceding interlocutory orders. \n6 \n\nCase: 23-30825      Document: 182-1     Page: 7     Date Filed: 02/12/2025\nNo. 23-30825 \nB \nWe turn next to § 1292(a)(1), which allows appeals from interlocutory \ninjunctions.    The  Supreme  Court  has  made  clear  that  a  court  order \n“relat[ing] only to the conduct or progress of litigation before that court \nordinarily is not considered an injunction and therefore is not appealable \nunder § 1292(a)(1).”  Gulfstream Aerospace Corp. v. Mayacamas Corp., 485 \nU.S. 271, 279 (1988).  Where an order “is merely a step in the litigation \nprocess and is in no way directed to the merits of the underlying action,” the \norder “is not appealable under § 1292(a)(1).”  S. Ute Indian Tribe v. Leavitt, \n564 F.3d 1198, 1206 (10th Cir. 2009) (quoting Lewis v. Bloomsburg Mills, Inc., \n608 F.2d 971, 973 (4th Cir. 1979)). \nDefendants  contend  that  the  Remedial  Order,  together  with  the \nJudgment  and  the  Remedial  Opinion,  is  an  injunction  appealable  under \n§ 1292(a)(1), but we disagree.  As an initial matter, Defendants admitted in \ntheir opening brief that the Remedial Order “does not identify the injunctive \nrelief to be granted.”  Now, Defendants complain that the Remedial Order’s \nprovisions  requiring  them  to  cooperate  with  the  special  masters  are \ninjunctive in nature.  But Defendants fail to mention that the district court \nhas not yet appointed a special master.5  Absent the current stay, Defendants’ \nonly current obligation under the Remedial Order would be to propose names \nof potential special masters to the district court.  That is not an injunction; it \n_____________________ \n5 The Remedial Order indicates that the district court plans to appoint three special \nmasters.  Defendants contend that the designation of three special masters violates the \nPrison Litigation Reform Act because, under the provisions of the Act, the district court \nmay  only  appoint  “a”  special  master,  not  multiple  special  masters.    18  U.S.C. \n§ 3626(f)(1)(A).  Because we lack appellate jurisdiction at this time to review the Remedial \nOrder, we do not reach the merits of this argument. \n7 \n\nCase: 23-30825      Document: 182-1     Page: 8     Date Filed: 02/12/2025\nNo. 23-30825 \nis a typical court directive advancing the litigation.  See Gulfstream, 485 U.S. \nat 279. \nThe Remedial Order’s requirements regarding cooperation with the \nspecial master, even if they were currently in effect, are not injunctive, either.  \nJust as parties are routinely ordered to participate in discovery to advance \nlitigation toward trial, Defendants here will be ordered to cooperate in certain \nrespects with the special master to advance the litigation toward a conclusion.  \nSee S. Ute Indian Tribe, 564 F.3d at 1207 (stating that although an order “may \nbe characterized as an order to do something, it is no more an ‘injunction’ \nthan is an order to turn over papers in discovery or submit to a physical \nexamination” (quoting Mercer v. Magnant, 40 F.3d 893, 896 (7th Cir. 1994))).  \nIndeed, the Remedial Order does not impose, nor by its own force will it \nimpose in the future, any substantive obligation upon Defendants regarding \nmedical care, the ADA, or the Rehabilitation Act.  We therefore conclude \nthat we lack jurisdiction under § 1292(a)(1). \nThe Remedial Order’s identification of subjects to be addressed by the \nRemedial Plans merely establishes a framework for the parties to create a \nsolution to any ongoing constitutional violations.  This alone does not render \nthe Remedial Order reviewable.  The district court has deferred judgment on \nthe steps, if any, that will be required to remedy constitutional violations in \nthe narrowest and least intrusive way.  In the meantime, Defendants are \nunder no obligation to change any of their practices.  Indeed, the Remedial \nOrder does not “specif[y] the content of the plan to be submitted such that \nthe content and scope of the remedial scheme is sufficiently clear to enable \nappellate review.”  Parsons v. Ryan, 949  F.3d 443, 473 (9th Cir. 2020) \n(internal quotation marks and citation omitted) (holding that court lacked \njurisdiction  under  §§ 1291  and  1292(a)(1)  over  post-settlement  orders, \nincluding orders requiring briefing on “what procedures were necessary to \ncompel compliance with” a stipulation and requiring defendants “to file a \n8 \n\nCase: 23-30825      Document: 182-1     Page: 9     Date Filed: 02/12/2025\nNo. 23-30825 \nplan to implement the recommendations made by an expert”); see id. (stating \nthat “[a]n order requiring a prison to submit a plan is not a final order under \n§ 1291”  and  that  “an  order  requiring  submission  of  a  remedial  plan  is \ngenerally not an injunction reviewable interlocutorily under § 1292(a)(1)” \n(internal quotation marks and citation omitted)); Balla v. Idaho State Bd. Of \nCorr., 869 F.2d 461, 464–65 (9th Cir. 1989) (collecting cases across judicial \ncircuits);  16  Charles  Alan  Wright,  Arthur  R.  Miller  & \nEdward  H.  Cooper,  Federal  Practice  and  Procedure \n§ 3922.2 (3d ed., June 2024 update) (“Orders that the parties prepare plans \nfor injunctive relief have figured in many attempted appeals.  Jurisdiction \nordinarily is denied, despite . . . substantial burdens that may be involved . . . .  \nEven orders that direct affirmative action out of court to aid in making \nremedial decisions have been held not injunctions.”). \nDefendants’  reliance  on  Brumfield  v.  Louisiana  State  Board  of \nEducation, 806 F.3d 289 (5th Cir. 2015), is misplaced.  Brumfield was an \nappeal following a district court order creating an oversight regime that \nwould be “repeated annually and indefinitely.”  Id. at 297.  In holding that \nappellate jurisdiction existed, we concluded that the oversight regime was \n“unlikely to lead to further judicial proceedings” and created an “endless \n[oversight] process.”  Id.  Here, the Remedial Order expressly contemplates \n“further judicial proceedings” and is not “endless”:  the special master in \nthis case will have only 120 days, at most,6 to submit Remedial Plans for the \ndistrict court’s approval.  Brumfield therefore does not control this case. \nNor do we believe Borel ex rel. AL v. School Board Saint Martin Parish, \n44  F.4th  307  (5th  Cir.  2022),  provides  appellate  jurisdiction  here.    As \n_____________________ \n6 The Remedial Order appears internally inconsistent on this front, designating a \n90-day deadline on page 4 and a 120-day deadline on pages 2 and 3. \n9 \n\nCase: 23-30825      Document: 182-1     Page: 10     Date Filed: 02/12/2025\nNo. 23-30825 \nDefendants point out, in that case we set forth the principle that in the school \ndesegregation context, appellate courts have jurisdiction over orders that \nimpose a continuing supervisory function on the court.  Id. at 312.  The appeal \nin Borel met that standard because the defendant school board had been \nsubject to an earlier injunction for nearly fifty years, and the order underlying \nthe  appeal  awarded  further  equitable  relief,  including  the  closure  of  an \nelementary school.  Id. at 311–12; see also Moore v. Tangipahoa Par. Sch. Bd., \n843 F.3d 198, 200–01 (5th Cir. 2016) (stating that in school desegregation \ncontext,  appellate  courts  can  exercise  jurisdiction  over  “subsequent \ninjunction[s]” flowing from initial equitable decrees).  In other words, there \nwere at least two district court injunctions in Borel.  Here, there are none.7 \nIII \nWe conclude by explaining why the cases cited in the dissenting \nopinion do not establish that appellate jurisdiction exists here. \n_____________________ \n7 Our conclusion that we lack jurisdiction is also not inconsistent with Gates v. Cook, \n376 F.3d 323 (5th Cir. 2004).  Gates was an appeal from an injunction entered by the district \ncourt to alleviate Eighth Amendment violations at the Mississippi State Penitentiary.  Id. \nat 327.  We concluded we had jurisdiction under § 1292(a)(1) because the district court’s \n“Final Judgment” imposed “ten detailed injunctive requirements” on the Mississippi \nDepartment of Corrections.  Id. at 327 n.1.  Unlike the Remedial Order here, the underlying \n“Final Judgment” in Gates imposed substantive “remedial action by the defendants to \ncorrect the Eighth Amendment violations.”  Russell v. Johnson, No. 1:02-CV-261, 2003 WL \n22208029, at *6–8 (N.D. Miss. May 21, 2003), aff’d in part, vacated in part sub nom. Gates, \n376 F.3d at 344.  These obligations included, among others, cleaning a prison cell before \nmoving an inmate to the cell; providing adequate cleaning supplies and equipment to \ninmates; providing fans, ice water, and daily showers to prisoners when the heat index \nreached  a  certain  level;  repairing  cell  windows;  and  upgrading  lighting.    Id.    The \nrequirements took effect immediately.  See generally id.; see also Ueckert, 38 F.4th at 450 \n(stating that interlocutory appeal is only valid if district judge intended order to be \n“effective  immediately”  and  “intend[ed]  to  have  nothing  further  to  do”  with  the \nunderlying request for relief (citations omitted)).   The Remedial Order imposes no \ncomparable obligation on Defendants here. \n10 \n\nCase: 23-30825      Document: 182-1     Page: 11     Date Filed: 02/12/2025\nNo. 23-30825 \nA \nSeeking to establish that the district court has entered an appealable \nfinal decision under § 1291, the dissenting opinion cites Brown Shoe Co. v. \nUnited States, 370 U.S. 294 (1962), and Morales v. Turman (Morales III), 535 \nF.2d 864 (5th Cir. 1976), rev’d on other grounds, 430 U.S. 322 (1977) (per \ncuriam).  In Brown Shoe Co., a Clayton Act challenge to a contemplated \nmerger between the Brown Shoe Co. and the G. R. Kinney Co., the district \ncourt ordered Brown “to divest itself completely of all stock, share capital, \nassets or other interests it held in Kinney” and “to file with the court within \n90 days a plan for carrying into effect the divestiture decreed.”  370 U.S. at \n304.  During oral argument, the Supreme Court sua sponte raised the issue \nof  appellate  jurisdiction,  asking  whether  the  district  court’s  failure  to \nmandate a specific dissolution plan and its solicitation of “suggested plans \nfor implementing divestiture” rendered its judgment insufficiently “final.”  \nId. at 305.  The Supreme Court held that there was jurisdiction under § 1291, \nnoting that “[f]ull divestiture by Brown of Kinney’s stock and assets was \nexpressly  required”  and  that  Brown  “was  permanently  enjoined  from \nacquiring or having any further interest in the business, stock or assets” of \nKinney.  Id. at 308. \nIn  Morales,  the  district  court  preliminarily  enjoined  a  facility  for \njuvenile offenders from, among other things, using physical force against \ninmates or segregating inmates based on race and ordered it to make 24-hour \nnursing care available.  See Morales v. Turman (Morales I), 364 F. Supp. 166, \n175–81 (E.D. Tex. 1973).  The district court later issued a decision extending \nthe effect of the preliminary injunction and setting forth detailed minimum \nstandards for the operation of the facility, including administering specific \ntypes of IQ tests, enlisting a language pathologist to assess each student, \nproviding a coeducational living environment, and hiring psychologists with \nmaster’s or doctorate degrees.  See generally Morales v. Turman (Morales II), \n11 \n\nCase: 23-30825      Document: 182-1     Page: 12     Date Filed: 02/12/2025\nNo. 23-30825 \n383 F. Supp. 53 (E.D. Tex. 1974); see also Morales v. Turman (Morales IV), \n562 F.2d 993, 997 (5th Cir. 1977) (recounting district court proceedings on \nremand from Supreme Court).  The district court did not issue permanent \ninjunctive relief and ordered the parties to submit a comprehensive plan that \nwould satisfy the minimum standards.  Morales III, 535 F.2d at 867 n.6.  In a \nfootnote, we held that we had appellate jurisdiction under § 1291 because the \ndistrict court had finally determined “the minimal content that must be given \nto the ‘right to treatment’ as it applies to virtually every aspect of [the \nfacility’s] operations.”  Id. \nThe  district  court  decisions  in  these  cases  contained  a  crucial \ningredient that is not present here: a substantive remedial holding that ends \nthe dispute on the merits and serves to guide the court and the parties as they \nmove into a “post-closure” phase of the case, in which the holding is merely \nimplemented (rather than contested) and subject to oversight.  In Brown Shoe \nCo., the court gave very specific directions to Brown: it had to divest itself \ncompletely of all interests in Kinney.  370 U.S. at 304.  The court solicited a \nplan for carrying out the divestiture, but the substantive decision (i.e., the \ndecision that divestiture was necessary) had been made.  See id.  Similarly, in \nMorales,  the  district  court  set  forth  “extremely  detailed  minimum \nstandards,” Morales IV, 562 F.2d at 997, determining “the minimal content \nthat must be given to the ‘right to treatment’” as applied to the operations \nof the relevant facility, Morales III, 535 F.2d at 867 n.6.  The parties had to \nsubmit a plan satisfying the minimum standards, but the district court had \nalready decided what those standards were.  See Morales III, 535 F.2d at 867 \nn.6.  The dissenting opinion points to no similar holding, in the Remedial \nOpinion or elsewhere, by the district court here.8 \n_____________________ \n8 The dissenting opinion cites to portions of the Remedial Opinion identifying \ndeficiencies in the care provided to LSP inmates.  Post, at 21 n.3, 24 n.6.  Identifying a \n12 \n\nCase: 23-30825      Document: 182-1     Page: 13     Date Filed: 02/12/2025\nNo. 23-30825 \nIndeed,  “Remedial  Opinion”  is  somewhat  of  a  misnomer;  the \nRemedial Opinion reads more like a second Liability Opinion, as it focuses \nmostly on whether the constitutional violations identified in 2021 in the \nLiability Opinion continued into 2022.  See generally Lewis II, 701 F. Supp. \n3d at 377–440; accord Valentine v. Collier, 993 F.3d 270, 282 (5th Cir. 2021) \n(stating that in prison litigation, inmate can obtain injunction only if inmate \ndemonstrates that deliberate indifference to medical needs continued up to \ntime of judgment and will continue into the future).  The “Remedy” section \nof the Remedial Opinion constitutes three paragraphs of a 104-page opinion \nand  merely  concludes  that  the  district  court  “will”  enter  permanent \ninjunctive relief separately.  Lewis II, 701 F. Supp. 3d at 440–41.  Further, as \nmentioned above, Defendants in their opening brief admitted that the district \ncourt has “not identif[ied] the injunctive relief to be granted.”  To sum up, \nthe district court has not specifically determined “the minimal content that \nmust be given” to Plaintiffs’ right to be free from Eighth Amendment, \nRehabilitation Act, or ADA violations as it applies to their confinement at \nLSP.  Morales III, 535 F.2d at 867 n.6. \n_____________________ \nproblem is obviously much different than setting forth a minimum standard of conduct, let \nalone ordering compliance with such a standard.  The distinction becomes clear upon a \nclose look at the dissenting opinion’s comparison between Morales II and the Remedial \nOrder here.  See post, at 23 n.5.  In Morales II, the court held that juvenile offenders were \n“entitled to care that conforms to the following minimally acceptable professional standards” \nand went on to identify those standards, eight in total, which included, inter alia, “[a] \npsychiatric staff[] consisting of psychiatrists certified by the American Board of Psychiatry \nand Neurology” and “[a] psychological staff” consisting of “psychologists holding either \nMaster’s degrees or Doctorates in psychology and experienced in work with adolescents.”  \n383 F. Supp. at 105 (emphasis added).  The Remedial Order here, on the other hand, directs \nthat  the  proposed  Medical  Care  Remedial  Plan  merely  “address[]”  standards  and \nprocedures for, inter alia, sick call (emphasis added).  The Remedial Order does not set \nforth any “minimally acceptable professional standard[]” that the Medical Care Remedial \nPlan must satisfy with respect to sick call.  Morales II, 383 F. Supp. at 105. \n13 \n\nCase: 23-30825      Document: 182-1     Page: 14     Date Filed: 02/12/2025\nNo. 23-30825 \nB \nSimilar logic distinguishes the cases cited by the dissenting opinion \nunder § 1292(a)(1).  In each of those cases, the district court entered an \ninjunction (or a de facto injunction) forbidding or ordering specific behavior \nimplicating the merits of the litigation.  For example, in Board of Public \nInstruction of Duval County v. Braxton, the district court ordered a school \nboard to desegregate its schools, forbade it from making funds or facilities \navailable for the maintenance of a segregated school system, and prohibited \nit from assigning staff to schools on the basis of race.  326 F.2d 616, 617–18 & \nn.1 (5th Cir. 1964).  The district court postponed the effect of much of the \ninjunction  and  ordered  the  parties  to  meanwhile  submit  a  plan  for \neffectuating the desegregation decree.  Id.  We held that there was appellate \njurisdiction under § 1292(a)(1) because the “ordering of the plan dealing \nexpressly with these prohibited acts amount[ed] to a mandatory injunction.”  Id. \nat 619 (emphasis added).9 \nSimilarly, in Johnson v. Gambrinus Co./Spoetzl Brewery, the district \ncourt entered an injunction ordering the defendant brewery to ensure that \ndisabled persons with guide dogs or other service animals “have the broadest \nfeasible access” to a public tour of the brewery.  116 F.3d 1052, 1056 (5th Cir. \n1997).  In Abbott v. Perez, moreover, the Supreme Court held that a lower \ncourt order was an appealable injunction because the court effectively held \n_____________________ \n9 It is true that, as the dissenting opinion notes, our approach in cases like Braxton \nand Morales III has been grouped with cases adopting “a more expansive approach to \nappeals from orders to submit proposed injunction decrees.”  Post, at 27 n.8 (quoting 16 \nCharles  Alan  Wright,  Arthur  R.  Miller  &  Edward  H.  Cooper, \nFederal Practice and Procedure § 3922.2 (3d ed., June 2024 update)); see also \nid. at 24–25 (discussing the Ninth Circuit’s decision in Balla).  But, as we explain, the \napproach of the dissenting opinion would expand the reach of our appellate jurisdiction \nwell beyond the bounds of even Braxton or Morales III. \n14 \n\nCase: 23-30825      Document: 182-1     Page: 15     Date Filed: 02/12/2025\nNo. 23-30825 \nthat upcoming elections could not proceed under redistricting plans then in \neffect.  585 U.S. 579, 598–99 (2018). \nAs Defendants acknowledged in their opening brief, the district court \nhere has entered no such injunctive relief.  There are not yet any specific \n“prohibited acts,” Braxton, 326 F.2d at 619, associated with the Remedial \nOrder, which (absent the current stay) merely directs Defendants to submit \nto the court names of proposed special masters.  The district court’s order in \nBraxton directing the parties to submit a desegregation plan did not by itself \ncreate appellate jurisdiction; that order was undisputedly connected to an \ninjunction  “prohibit[ing]”  specific  “acts”  implicating  the  merits  of  the \nlitigation, i.e., desegregation of a school system.  Id.10 \nFinally,  the  dissenting  opinion  doubts  that  the  district  court  will \nreconsider its findings in the Liability Opinion and Remedial Opinion.  The \ndissenting opinion urges us not to “wait until the ink is dry on every minute \npoint  in  a  comprehensive  institutional  reform  plan  before  permitting \nappellate review.”  Post, at 31. \nThe dissenting opinion’s worries illustrate why appellate review is \npremature.  The possibility remains that there will be no “comprehensive \ninstitutional reform plan” at all.  The special master—considering, as the law \n_____________________ \n10 The dissenting opinion raises the possibility of a contempt citation for failure to \ncomply with the Remedial Order, but such a possibility does not automatically create \nimmediate appellate jurisdiction.  See A-Mark Auction Galleries, Inc. v. Am. Numismatic \nAss’n, 233 F.3d 895, 899 (5th Cir. 2000) (holding that discovery orders are not appealable \nunder the collateral order doctrine because the subject of the order “may resist that order, \nbe cited for contempt, and then challenge the propriety of the discovery order in the course \nof appealing the contempt citation” (quoting MDK, Inc. v. Mike’s Train House, Inc., 27 F.3d \n116, 121 (4th Cir. 1994))); S. Ute Indian Tribe, 564 F.3d at 1207 (stating that although an \norder “may be characterized as an order to do something, it is no more an ‘injunction’ than \nis an order to turn over papers in discovery or submit to a physical examination” (quoting \nMercer, 40 F.3d at 896)). \n15 \n\nCase: 23-30825      Document: 182-1     Page: 16     Date Filed: 02/12/2025\nNo. 23-30825 \nrequires, prison officials’ “current attitudes and conduct” as of the date any \nRemedial Plan is submitted for the district court’s approval, Valentine, 993 \nF.3d at 282 (quoting Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 845 (1994))—may well \nconclude that LSP has already remedied any preexisting constitutional and \nstatutory violations and that a permanent injunction is no longer necessary.  \nWe trust that on remand, the special master and district court will conduct \nthe appropriate inquiry and design final relief, if any, appropriate to the \ncircumstances existing as of the date it is entered. \nIV \nAccordingly, we DISMISS this appeal and VACATE the stay of the \nRemedial Order.\n16 \n\nCase: 23-30825      Document: 182-1     Page: 17     Date Filed: 02/12/2025\nNo. 23-30825 \nEdith Hollan Jones, Circuit Judge, dissenting: \nI respectfully dissent from the panel’s improper dismissal of this \nappeal.  This litigation concerning allegedly unconstitutional medical care at \nthe Louisiana State Penitentiary (“LSP”) has been pending for ten years.  In \nlate 2023, the district court assumed control of LSP’s medical and disabled \ncare.    The  court’s  opinions,  Remedial  Order,  and  Final  Judgment  just \nignored the requirements of the Prison Litigation Reform Act (“PLRA”) \ngoverning remedial decrees.  18 U.S.C. §§ 3626(a), 3626(f).  Thus, inter alia, \nthe court appointed three “special masters” in lieu of one allowed by the \nPLRA; it ignored the statutory selection process for a single special master; \nit required the state to pay for the “special masters,” though the federal \ncourts bear that cost under the PLRA; and it omitted any discussion about \nhow the multitude of changes required of LSP satisfy the PLRA’s needs-\nnarrowness-intrusiveness limitations on equitable relief. \nYet  my  colleagues  in the  majority  assert  that the  district  court’s \nRemedial Order and Final Judgment,1 incorporating its previous 124-page \nLiability Opinion and later 104-page Remedial Opinion, are not sufficiently \n“final” nor sufficiently “injunctive” to support an appeal under 28 U.S.C. \n§§ 1291 or 1292(a)(1), respectively.  Both holdings are very wrong.  If the \ndismissal is upheld, the Defendants will bear enormous costs to comply with \norders that plainly defy the PLRA.  The violations are so obvious that the \npanel majority, while claiming to have no jurisdiction, hint and smuggle in \n_____________________ \n1 The Judgment states: “Judgment is hereby entered in favor of Class Plaintiffs and \nthe ADA Sub-Class Plaintiffs . . . .  This matter shall be closed . . . ; however, the Court \nretains jurisdiction over the procedures set forth in the Court’s Remedial Order and any issues \npertaining thereto.”  (emphasis added).  The “substance” of liability and relief have been \ndecided, only the details of “procedures” remain for the court to supervise.  See Appendix. \n17 \n\nCase: 23-30825      Document: 182-1     Page: 18     Date Filed: 02/12/2025\nNo. 23-30825 \nnotes about what the district court must change to comply with the PLRA.2  \nIn the meantime, until the majority’s view of finality obtains, the Defendants \nmust play a remedial game contrary to the rules prescribed by Congress.  The \nPLRA’s rules were enacted precisely to curtail intrusive court oversight of \npenal institutions.  Ignoring those rules mandates appellate review now. \nTo  discuss  the  errors  in  the  decision  to  dismiss,  I  survey  the \nlitigation’s  background  and  attach  as  an  Appendix  the  district  court’s \nRemedial Order and Final Judgment.  Next, I address the Supreme Court’s \nand  this  court’s  precedents  explaining  “finality”  and  “injunctions”  in \nregard to institutional reform litigation in the federal courts.  The majority \nelide important details in the district court’s orders to reach their preferred \nresult, and they fail to discuss the most relevant case law.  Finally, because \nappellate jurisdiction exists on either statutory ground, it is imperative to \nexplain how the Remedial Order and Final Judgment violate the PLRA, and \nwhy the Remedial Opinion fails to properly apply the deliberate indifference \nstandard. \nI. \nThe plaintiff prisoner class sued the Defendants in 2015 in the Middle \nDistrict of Louisiana seeking redress for claims that the prison’s medical care \nwas constitutionally inadequate, and its facilities violated the Americans with \nDisabilities Act (“ADA”) and the Rehabilitation Act (“RA”).  The case was \ntried for several weeks in October 2018, but the court rendered a Liability \nOpinion on March 31, 2021.  The Liability Opinion contained extensive \nfindings about LSP’s systemic failure to provide constitutionally adequate  \ninmate medical care and comply with the ADA/RA.  The court held the \ndefendants  liable  under  the  Eighth  Amendment  and  federal  disability \n_____________________ \n2 Ante at 7 n.5, 7–8. \n18 \n\nCase: 23-30825      Document: 182-1     Page: 19     Date Filed: 02/12/2025\nNo. 23-30825 \nstatutes.  In June 2022, three and a half years after the liability trial, the court \nheld another trial to consider the scope and nature of remedies required of \nthe prison.  Its Remedial Opinion was issued more than a year later on \nNovember 6, 2023. \nThe Liability Opinion dwelt on evidence from years before the district \ncourt’s formal rulings.  The Remedial Opinion rested on somewhat updated \nevidence from early 2019 but ignored material developments near the date of \nJudgment.  Yet the Defendants, conscious of the court’s oversight, had been \ntaking  important  strides  to  improve  LSP’s  inmate  medical  care.    For \ninstance, LSP fully introduced electronic medical records management in \nOctober 2022, an innovation critical to the court’s liability and remedy \nfindings.  But although the court was apprised of this development—and \nothers—the court refused to consider them.  Instead, it found the Defendants \nculpable  for  obsolete  practices.    Lewis  v.  Cain  (Remedial  Opinion),  701 \nF. Supp. 3d 361, 389 (M.D. La. 2023) (“The utter and complete disarray of \nthe medical records is emblematic of indifference.”). \nConcurrent with the Remedial Opinion, in November 2023 the court \nissued a Remedial Order and Final Judgment.  The Judgment stated: \nJudgment is hereby entered in favor of Class Plaintiffs and the \nADA Sub-Class Plaintiffs and against Defendants, the current \nWarden of the Louisiana State Penitentiary, et al.  This matter \nshall be closed by the Clerk of Court; however, the Court \nretains jurisdiction over the procedures set forth in the Court’s \nRemedial Order and any issues pertaining thereto. \nFurther, the Remedial Order stated, in pertinent part: \nFor the reasons set forth in the court’s Rulings, dated March \n31,  2021  (‘Liability  Ruling’)  and  November  6,  2023, \n(‘Remedial Ruling’): \nIT IS HEREBY ORDERED: . . . . \n19 \n\nCase: 23-30825      Document: 182-1     Page: 20     Date Filed: 02/12/2025\nNo. 23-30825 \nSix decretal sections of the Remedial Order followed, concerning \nSpecial  Masters;  Remedial  Plans  for  Medical  Care  and  the  ADA; \nCooperation  and  Access  to  require  the  Defendants’  coordination  with \nSpecial Masters or their representatives; Reporting, a timetable for reporting \nto the court; Monitoring Implementation of Remedial Plans and Periodic \nReports to the Court; and Fees and Costs.  Each of these sections has \nnumerous subsections regarding particular deficiencies to be corrected.  The \ndetails of these sections and subsections will be referenced as appropriate.  \nNotably, under the Fees provision, the court required “all costs associated \nwith the work and reporting of the Special Masters” to be “paid by the \nDefendants.”  The Fees provision also authorized Plaintiffs’ counsel to file \nfee  applications  for  the  initial  litigation  as “prevailing  parties”  plus  fee \nrequests at 90-day intervals in the future.  The Remedial Order is attached \nhereto as an Appendix. \nUpon entry of the Judgment, the court administratively closed the \ncase. \nII. \n  This court’s jurisdiction to hear appeals is ordinarily governed by \n28 U.S.C. §§ 1291 and 1292.  “Finality” is the touchstone for § 1291, which \npermits  “appeals  from  all  final  decisions  of  the  district  courts[.]”  \n28 U.S.C. § 1291.  Section 1292(a)(1) permits appeals from “[i]nterlocutory \norders of the district courts . . . granting, continuing, modifying, refusing or \ndissolving injunctions[.]”  28 U.S.C. § 1292(a)(1).  Under either section, this \ncourt has jurisdiction to hear the present appeal.  At the very least, exercising \nappellate jurisdiction is imperative to prevent the district court from forcing \nthe state to engage in actions not required by the PLRA.   \n20 \n\nCase: 23-30825      Document: 182-1     Page: 21     Date Filed: 02/12/2025\nNo. 23-30825 \nA. \nThe  Remedial  Order  is  a  final  judgment  under  § 1291  because  it \nintended to end the litigation regarding LSP’s liability and specify a detailed \nframework  for  the  remedy  going  forward.    The  Final  Judgment  retains \njurisdiction  in  the  district  court  only  over  “procedures  set  forth  in  the \nRemedial Order and any issues pertaining thereto” (emphasis added).  The \nconcurrent Remedial Opinion “enter[ed] judgment in favor of Plaintiffs and \nagainst Defendants.”  Remedial Opinion, 701 F. Supp. 3d at 441 (emphasis \nadded).  These are clear indicia of the district court’s intent to issue a final \njudgment. \nFurther exhibiting its intent of finality, the Remedial Order describes \nthe Plaintiffs as “prevailing parties” entitled to file a fee request.  Despite the \nRemedial Order’s provision for the appointment of special masters, the \ndistrict  court  carefully  articulates  how  unconstitutional  medical  care \nconditions must be cured.  The section titled, “Remedial Plans for Medical \nCare and the ADA” identifies seven areas of “standards and procedures” \nthat must be upgraded: sick call, clinical care, specialty care, infirmary and \nin-patient care, emergency care, medical records management, and medical \nmanagement  and  administration.    Further,  the  Remedial  Opinion, \nincorporated in the Remedial Order, identifies with even greater specificity \nthe allegedly deficient care LSP provided.3  Labels alone cannot make a non-\n_____________________ \n3 For example, as to infirmary and in-patient care, “patients continue to be outside \nof sight or sound of nurses due to the positioning of nurses and black coverings over \nwindows,”  nurses  do  not  round  patients  every  two  hours,  “head-to-toe”  physical \nassessments of patients by nursing staff are not performed sufficiently, infirmary forms do \nnot provide a space for date and time, vital sign flowsheets do not allow for documentation \nof the time vitals were taken, the infirmary does not provide adequate equipment and \nsupplies including “crutches, walkers, or bedside commodes,” and inmate orderlies \nperform  tasks  outside  the  scope  of  their  appropriate  use.    Remedial  Opinion,  701 \nF. Supp. 3d. at 410–11. \n21 \n\nCase: 23-30825      Document: 182-1     Page: 22     Date Filed: 02/12/2025\nNo. 23-30825 \nfinal order final.  Riley v. Kennedy, 553 U.S. 406, 419, 128 S. Ct. 1970, 1981 \n(2008).  Yet the district court’s framing of the litigation as complete, and the \nlevel of detail contained in the Remedial Order and incorporated Remedial \nOpinion,  demonstrate  that  the  court  resolved  the  substantive  issues  in \nlitigation. \nThe majority recites the general rule that “[a] final decision is one by \nwhich a district court disassociates itself from a case,” but it overlooks that \n§ 1291 should be applied without wooden formality.  Ante at 5.  “A pragmatic \napproach to the question of finality has been considered essential to the \nachievement of the just, speedy, and inexpensive determination of every \naction: the touchstones of federal procedure.”  Brown Shoe Co. v. United \nStates, 370 U.S. 294, 306, 82 S. Ct. 1502, 1513 (1962) (internal quotation \nmarks and citation omitted).  In Brown Shoe, the judgment required the \ndefendant “to propose in the immediate future a plan for carrying into effect \nthe court’s order.”  Id. at 308, 82 S. Ct. at 1514.  But the Supreme Court held \nthat the administration of the plan was “sufficiently independent of, and \nsubordinate to, the issues presented by th[e] appeal to make the case in its \npresent posture a proper one for review now.”  Id.  Likewise in this case, as \nin Brown Shoe and many cases involving institutional reforms, the provision \nfor  the  appointment  of  special  masters  should  not  detract  from  the \njudgment’s overwhelming specificity that justifies appellate review. \nTo be clear, the court has finally (1) decided on remedial measures \nthat  flatly  violate  the  PLRA;  (2)  misapplied  the  Eighth  Amendment \nstandards governing the extent of LSP’s liability and permissible judicial \nremedial orders; and (3) inaccurately determined that LSP’s conditions and \nprocedures violate the ADA/RA.  These issues are fully independent of \nfurther “procedures” that, according to the Remedial Order, may arise as \nspecial  masters  enforce  the  remedial  framework  already  created  by  the \ndistrict court. \n22 \n\nCase: 23-30825      Document: 182-1     Page: 23     Date Filed: 02/12/2025\nNo. 23-30825 \nThis court has deemed similar judgments final and appealable.  In a \ncase with substantially the same posture, a district court determined that \npractices at Texas’s juvenile correctional facilities constituted cruel and \nunusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment.  Morales v. Turman, \n535 F.2d 864, 867 (5th Cir. 1976), rev’d on other grounds, 430 U.S. 322, \n97 S. Ct. 1189 (1977).  The plaintiffs maintained there was no final order \nbecause “the judge withheld issuance of permanent injunctive relief pending \nsubmission of a comprehensive plan to be drawn up by the parties.”  Id. at \n867 n.6.  This court had no problem rejecting plaintiffs’ argument.  “The \ndifficulty with this contention is that while some flexibility was left to the \nparties  in  determining  precisely  how  compliance  with  the  minimum \nstandards would be structured, the District Court made it perfectly clear that \nany plan submitted must be consistent with the minimum requirements laid \nout in its opinion.”4  Id.  The minimum standards constituted a “final \nadjudication” for purposes of § 1291.  Id. \nSimilarly, in J W by and through Tammy Williams v. Birmingham Board \nof Education, the district court’s order was final and appealable because it \nincluded detailed factual findings and legal conclusions that constitutional \nrights had been violated, but ordered the parties to “submit a proposed \ntraining and procedure plan that would remedy the constitutional problems \nidentified  in  its  order”  and  included  as  guidance  a  series  of  “general \npractices.”  904 F.3d 1248, 1254–56 (11th Cir. 2018). \nContrary to the majority’s contention, see ante at 11–12, the minimum \nstandards in the Remedial Order are, in large part, more detailed than the \n_____________________ \n4 On further appeal, the Supreme Court simply stated that the district court’s \n“judgment is reviewable on the merits in the Court of Appeals.”  Morales v. Turman, 430 \nU.S. 322, 324, 97 S. Ct. 1189, 1190 (1977) (citing 28 U.S.C. § 1291). \n23 \n\nCase: 23-30825      Document: 182-1     Page: 24     Date Filed: 02/12/2025\nNo. 23-30825 \nminimum standards deemed sufficient for appellate jurisdiction in Morales.5  \nIn Morales, the legally relevant elements of decretal terms like “adequate \ninfirmary facilities” became clear in light of the court’s opinion.  Here, the \nlegally  relevant  elements  of  the  already  specific  Remedial  Order  are \nabundantly clear in light of the Remedial Opinion’s granular explication of \nLSP’s constitutional shortcomings. 6  See Morales, 535 F.2d at 867 n.6.  \nThe  majority  muster  only  out-of-circuit,  non-binding  case  law  to \nsupport their position.  Ante at 8–9 (quoting Parsons v. Ryan, 949 F.3d 443, \n473 (9th Cir. 2020); Balla v. Idaho State Bd. of Corr., 869 F.2d 461, 464–65 \n(9th Cir. 1989)).  It should come as no surprise that the scope of appellate \njurisdiction in Fifth Circuit institutional reform litigation differs from Ninth \nCircuit rulings.  This circuit had significant experience in reviewing such \nrulings during the period that schools and public facilities were desegregated \nfrom the 1960s on.  See Frank T. Read, The Bloodless Revolution: The Role of \n_____________________ \n5 Compare Appendix (plan must address Sick Call standards such as “the sick call \nrequest process, evaluation by a provider, and documentation,” Emergency Care standards \nincluding  “protocols  for  the  appropriate  use  and  training  of  EMTs,”  and  “the \nappointment of a qualified, properly trained ADA Coordinator”), with Morales v. Turman, \n383 F. Supp. 53, 105 (E.D. Tex. 1974) (plan must address “[a]dequate infirmary facilities” \nand “[a]ccess to medical staff without delay or interference”).  \n6 Take, for example, the Remedial Order’s and Opinion’s specific dictates with \nrespect to sick call standards.  The Opinion held that LSP’s sick call is constitutionally \ninadequate because LSP does not review complaints daily, the sick call request form \nprovides no place for the patient to time and date their request or time and date when the \nrequest was received, the triage process is not explained and is not noted in patient charts, \nphysical examinations are performed by EMTs rather than by Nurse Practitioners, and sick \ncalls are at times conducted via telemedicine rather than in-person.  Remedial Opinion, 701 \nF. Supp. 3d. at 392–95.  These are not “mere guidelines subject to further negotiation,” \nbut clear constitutional deficiencies the remedial plan “must be consistent with” and \nremedy.  See Morales, 535 F.2d at 867 n.6.  The Remedial Opinion and Order establish the \nrequirements LSP must satisfy to pass constitutional muster with sufficient specificity to \npermit appellate review.  \n24 \n\nCase: 23-30825      Document: 182-1     Page: 25     Date Filed: 02/12/2025\nNo. 23-30825 \nthe Fifth Circuit in the Integration of the Deep South, 32 Mercer L. Rev. \n1149 (1981).   \nThe Ninth Circuit views “orders requiring the submission of detailed \nplans” as “not final orders appealable” under § 1291.  Parsons, 949 F.3d 443 \n(citation omitted); Balla, 869 F.2d at 464–65.  That is incompatible with our \nholding in Morales that “while some flexibility was left to the parties in \ndetermining precisely how compliance with the minimum standard would be \nstructured,” the required submission of a plan is appealable under § 1291 \nbecause “[i]n circumstances such as these, the requirement of finality must \nbe given a practical construction.”  535 F.2d at 867 n.6.; see also Abbott v. \nPerez, 585 U.S. 579, 601, 138 S. Ct. 2305, 2323 (2018).  In fact, the Balla court \nexplicitly distinguished its view of § 1291 from this circuit’s approach.  869 \nF.2d at 465 (citing United States v. Alabama, 828 F.2d 1532, 1536–38 (11th \nCir. 1987) (“Our decision follows the reasoning of this court’s predecessor \nin Morales v. Turman.”)).  The law of this circuit, not that of the Ninth, \ncontrols our decision.   \nIn this case, neither the appointment of special masters nor the federal \ncourt’s future supervision of the details of compliance deprives the Final \nJudgment of its finality.  The district court “made perfectly clear” that any \nremedial plan must be consistent with the “minimum requirements” of the \nEighth Amendment, ADA, and RA; it defined those requirements in its 104-\npage Remedial Opinion; and it reiterated their scope in the Remedial Order.  \nSee Morales, 535 F.2d at 867 n.6.  The district court’s already-specific opinion \nand judgment may not be enlarged by the special masters’ recommendations.  \nThe concrete issues raised and fully briefed before us are ripe for appellate \nreview.    Accordingly,  the  Remedial  Order  and  accompanying  Remedial \nOpinion and Liability Opinion constitute a final judgment pursuant to § 1291. \n25 \n\nCase: 23-30825      Document: 182-1     Page: 26     Date Filed: 02/12/2025\nNo. 23-30825 \nB. \nEven  if  the  Remedial  Order  is  not  “final”  under  § 1291,  it  is \nsufficiently injunctive to support an appeal under § 1292(a)(1), which grants \ncourts of appeals jurisdiction over “[i]nterlocutory orders of the district \ncourts . . . granting,  continuing,  modifying,  refusing  or  dissolving \ninjunctions[.]”    When  “an  order  has  the  practical  effect  of  granting  or \ndenying an injunction, it should be treated as such for purposes of appellate \njurisdiction.”  Abbott, 585 U.S. at 594, 138 S. Ct. at 2319 (quotation marks \nand citation omitted).  In the context of institutional reform litigation, this \ncourt does not delay our review until the minutiae of a remedial plan are \nmemorialized.  Doing so would undermine the very purpose of § 1292(a)(1).  \nId. at 595, 138 S. Ct. at 2319 (“Much harm can occur before the final decision \nin the district court,” and “[l]awful and important conduct may be barred, \nand unlawful and harmful conduct may be allowed to continue.”).  In this \ncase, the “unlawful and harmful conduct” is the district court’s insistence \non a Remedial Order that plainly violates the PLRA and exceeds the court’s \nlawful authority. \nThe  majority  posit  several  reasons  why  the  Remedial  Order’s \nprovisions are insufficiently injunctive under § 1292(a)(1).  Preliminarily, the \nmajority repeatedly quote the Defendants’ refusals to rest on § 1292(a)(1) as \na jurisdictional basis—until this court required supplemental briefing.  Of \ncourse, we are not bound by the parties’ assertions about jurisdiction, and \nneither party questioned appellate jurisdiction before this court raised the \nissue.  Tellingly, in their supplemental briefing, the Plaintiffs challenge only \nthe Remedial Order’s “finality” under § 1291.  The Plaintiffs do not deny \nthat it is injunctive within § 1292(a)(1).  The Defendants’ claimed admission \nis a red herring.  \n26 \n\nCase: 23-30825      Document: 182-1     Page: 27     Date Filed: 02/12/2025\nNo. 23-30825 \nThe majority also contend that the Remedial Order’s requirements \nare too general and indefinite to constitute injunctive relief.  They assert that \nprovisions, e.g., to “meet and confer” to select three special masters and to \naccommodate plaintiffs’ requests for documents within twenty-four hours, \nare merely steps on the road toward finality.7  Finally, because the Remedial \nOrder allegedly lacks definitive requirements,8 the majority see no prospect \nthat LSP’s failure to comply could garner appealable contempt citations.  \nThese contentions reflect general appellate review principles that might \napply—were it not for our precedent and the facts. \nAs a matter of precedent, this court has routinely found appellate \njurisdiction in institutional reform cases.  For instance, a district court order \nthat the parties submit a “detailed and comprehensive plan” at a future date, \nto enforce generally outlined prohibitions on racial discrimination in the \npublic schools, was appealable as an injunction.  Bd. of Pub. Instruction of \nDuval Cnty. v. Braxton, 326 F.2d 616, 617 (5th Cir. 1964).  In Duval County, \n_____________________ \n7 The majority’s few but inapt citations, see ante at 7–8, include Gulfstream \nAerospace Corp. v. Mayacamas Corp., 485 U.S. 271, 273–79, 108 S. Ct. 1133, 1135–38 (1988) \n(denying a motion to exercise Colorado River abstention), and Lewis v. Bloomsburg Mills, \nInc.,  608  F.2d  971,  972–73  (4th  Cir.  1979) (order  prohibiting  post-certification \ncommunications among class members).  The majority further cite two cases that are \ndistinguishable on the facts.  Mercer v. Magnant, 40 F.3d 893, 897 (7th Cir. 1994), found no \nappellate jurisdiction where the parties’ disagreement about the calculation of an unknown \namount of tax refunds required further district court effort to render a remedy.  And in S. \nUte Indian Tribe v. Leavitt, 564 F.3d 1198, 1200 (10th Cir. 2009), an order requiring the \nparties to negotiate a “self determination contract” with no parameters was held non-final \nbecause the scope of future litigation and any remedy were unknowable. \n8 The majority again cite Parsons, 949 F.3d at 473, and Balla, 869 F.2d at 464-65.  \nAnte at 8–9.  But see 16 Charles Alan Wright & Arthur R. Miller, Federal \nPractice and Procedure § 3921.2 (3d ed. 2024) (citing Fifth Circuit precedent \nadopting  “a  more  expansive  approach  to  appeals  from  orders  to  submit  proposed \ninjunction decrees”) (citing Abbott, 585 U.S. at 594–603, 138 S. Ct. at 2319–24; Morales, \n535 F.2d at 867 n.6; Bd. of Pub. Instruction of Duval Cnty., Fla. v. Braxton, 326 F.2d 616, 617 \n(5th Cir. 1964), cert. denied, 377 U.S. 924, 84 S. Ct. 1223 (1964)). \n27 \n\nCase: 23-30825      Document: 182-1     Page: 28     Date Filed: 02/12/2025\nNo. 23-30825 \nthis court cited previous supporting precedents and noted, “the [district] \nCourt positively and affirmatively directed that a plan be submitted that \nwould provide for carrying out the [order] that [was] to be later effectuated.”  \nId. at 619.  As a result, “the ordering of the plan dealing expressly with these \nprohibited acts amounts to a mandatory injunction.”  Id.   \nIn Morales, supra, this court alternatively held that, “[i]n any event, \nthe order requiring that the parties meet and negotiate a plan complying with \nthe decision is itself a mandatory injunction which is appealable” under \n§ 1292(a)(1).  535 F.2d at 867 n.6.   \nApplying our precedents, this court concluded that an order requiring \nthe parties to meet and negotiate a plan to bring a business into compliance \nwith the ADA was an injunction.  Johnson v. Gambrinus Co./Spoetzl Brewery, \n116 F.3d 1052, 1056–57 (5th Cir. 1997).  The district court determined that \nthe defendant’s “no animals” policy during brewery tours violated the ADA \nand  ordered  the  defendant  to  “submit  a  written  policy \nincorporating . . . guidance” from the government.  Id. at 1057.  The order \n“in effect” required the defendant to consult the government about the \nmodifications,  submit  a  policy  to  the  district  court  incorporating  such \nconsultation,  and  make  the  modifications  in  the  future.    Id.    This  was \nsufficient to establish appellate jurisdiction pursuant to § 1292(a)(1).  Id. \nMore recently, this court held that an order requiring Louisiana to \nreport to the federal government racial data and test scores for each of its \npublic  schools  constituted  an  appealable  injunction  under  § 1292(a)(1).  \nBrumfield  v.  La.  State  Bd.  of  Educ.,  806  F.3d  289,  296  (5th  Cir.  2015).  \nAlthough the order involved only information sharing, it was far from an \nunappealable interlocutory order.  “The content of the [order] ma[de] clear \nthat it is not for discovery.”  Id. at 297.  \n28 \n\nCase: 23-30825      Document: 182-1     Page: 29     Date Filed: 02/12/2025\nNo. 23-30825 \nThis series of authorities refutes each of the majority’s grounds for \ndenying that the Remedial Order is an appealable injunction.  The fact that \ndetails of administration may need to be worked out is no different from the \nfuture implementation of detailed school desegregation plans that this court \nroutinely reviewed on appeal.  See Duval Cnty., 326 F.2d at 617.  The orders \nto  “meet  and  confer,”  provide  documents  and  LSP  personnel  at  the \nmasters’  request,  pay  for  special  masters,  and  redress  the  innumerable \nshortcomings  listed  in  the  Remedial  Opinion  and  incorporated  in  the \nRemedial Order are on point with appellate review decisions in Morales, 535 \nF.2d at 867 n.6, and Johnson, 116 F.3d at 1056-57.  And as in Brumfield, these \nprovisions “make clear” that they are not interim orders subject to alteration \nby the district court, but an outline of the essential parts of the district court’s \nremedial framework.  Further echoing Brumfield, the current requirements of \nthe Remedial Order will subject LSP to a “burdensome, costly, and endless \nprocess,”  and  the  Remedial  Order  contemplates  a  “new  and \ndifferent . . . regime.”  806 F.3d at 297.  See Appendix (requiring special \nmaster reports “at recurring intervals every six months”).  \nThe Supreme Court’s recent decision in Abbott v. Perez confirms what \nthis circuit’s binding law has been for sixty years: “whether any particular \nremedies would have ultimately been ordered by the District Court” does \nnot deprive this court of appellate jurisdiction.  585 U.S. at 601, 138 S. Ct. at \n2323.  In Abbott, a three-judge court held that (1) Texas’s legislative plans \n“violate § 2 and the Fourteenth Amendment,” and (2) these violations \n“must be remedied.”  Id. at 598, 138 S. Ct. at 2321.  If Texas did not intend \nto adopt new plans, the court would hold a subsequent remedial hearing.  Id.  \nThe order did nothing more.  The Supreme Court recognized that the “court \nintended to have new plans ready for use,” and Texas risked “deleterious \nconsequences” if it attempted to implement redistricting plans the court had \njust found unconstitutional.  Id. at 599, 138 S. Ct. at 2322.  The three-judge \n29 \n\nCase: 23-30825      Document: 182-1     Page: 30     Date Filed: 02/12/2025\nNo. 23-30825 \ncourt’s rejection of the status quo was sufficiently injunctive to establish \njurisdiction.  Id. at 601, 138 S. Ct. at 2323.  The Court explicitly rejected the \nnotion “that appellate jurisdiction is lacking . . . because we do not know at \nthis point what a remedy would entail, who it would affect, and when it would \nbe implemented.”  Id. (quotation marks and citation omitted).  \nAs in Abbott, here “[n]othing in the record even hints that the court \ncontemplated the possibility of allowing” the status quo ante at LSP to \ncontinue.  See id. at 599, 138 S. Ct. at 2322.  That the Remedial Order \nprovides a clear outline about required changes is sufficient to establish \nappellate jurisdiction under the “practical effect” given to § 1292(a)(1).  See \nid. at 595, 138 S. Ct. at 2320. \nNot only is the law contrary to the majority’s suppositions, but the \nfacts equally undermine their reasoning.  Although the majority fail to analyze \nits contents, the Remedial Order places specific commands on the state \nDefendants.9  If the state does not abide by these provisions—inter alia, to \nmeet and confer, to agree to three special masters, to pay costs of special \nmasters, to make available personnel, documents, and even prisoners on \nshort  notice—who  would  doubt  that  plaintiffs  would  seek  to  hold  it  in \ncontempt?    See  Abbott,  585  U.S.  at  599,  138  S. Ct.  at  2322  (appellate \njurisdiction  lay  when  “Texas  had  reason  to  believe  that  it  would  risk \ndeleterious consequences if it defied the court”).  Does the appointment of \n_____________________ \n9 The Remedial Order’s requirements include the following: \n•  The parties are “hereby Ordered to meet and confer” to appoint three Special Mas-\nters.   \n•  The state must pay “[a]ll costs associated with the work and reporting of the Special \nMasters[.]”   \n•  The Special Masters “shall have access” to any and all relevant records and the De-\npartment of Corrections “shall provide any records or documents requested without \ndelay[.]”   \n•  The state must designate personnel to work with the Special Masters.   \n30 \n\nCase: 23-30825      Document: 182-1     Page: 31     Date Filed: 02/12/2025\nNo. 23-30825 \nspecial masters mean that the district court’s liability and remedial findings \nare somehow subject to alteration?  Of course not.  The masters are tasked \nwith enforcing the court’s conclusions, a task subject to arguable details but \nplainly under the umbrella of the Remedial Order and the incorporated \nRemedial Opinion’s itemized findings.  See Morales, 535 F.2d at 867 n.6 \n(appellate jurisdiction existed where the district court “require[ed] that the \nparties meet and negotiate a plan complying with the decision” “consistent \nwith the minimum requirements laid out in its opinion”).   \nAs in Abbott, Brumfield, Johnson,  Morales, and Duval County, the \nRemedial Order here changes the state’s permissible conduct and alters its \nability to manage LSP.  To the district court, the status quo at LSP is \nunconstitutional and in violation of federal law.  The court “intend[s] to have \nnew  plans  ready  for  use,”  and  Louisiana’s  noncompliance  would  risk \n“deleterious consequences.”  Abbott, 585 U.S. at 601, 138 S. Ct. at 2323.  The \nRemedial Order, furthermore, mandates Defendants’ cooperation with and \nfooting the bill for three special masters, regardless of what plans are yet to \ncome.  See Johnson, 116 F.3d at 1057.  This court has not required public \nentities subjected to broad, compulsory remedial decrees to wait until the ink \nis dry on every minute point in a comprehensive institutional reform plan \nbefore  permitting  appellate  review.    We  have  jurisdiction  to  review  the \nRemedial Order pursuant to § 1292(a)(1). \nConcomitantly,  we  have  jurisdiction  to  review  the  Remedial  and \nLiability Opinions as briefed by both parties.  Our jurisdiction extends to \n“determining  whether  there  is  any  insuperable  objection,  in  point  of \njurisdiction or merits” to the injunction.  Denver v. N.Y. Trust Co., 229 U.S. \n123,  136,  33  S. Ct.  657,  663  (1913)  (emphasis  added).    Our  review, \nfurthermore, “properly extends to all matters inextricably bound up with the \ninjunction decision.”  16 Charles  Alan  Wright  &  Arthur  R. \nMiller,  Federal  Practice  and  Procedure  § 3921.1  (3d  ed. \n31 \n\nCase: 23-30825      Document: 182-1     Page: 32     Date Filed: 02/12/2025\nNo. 23-30825 \n2024); Abbott, 585 U.S. at 603–07, 138 S. Ct. at 2324–26 (examining merits \nof  district  court  judgment  supporting  injunction);  see  also  Biediger  v. \nQuinnipiac Univ., 691 F.3d 85, 96 (2d Cir. 2012).  Whether the district court’s \ndecree systemically violates the PLRA is plainly cognizable.  It is a threshold \ninquiry necessary to determine the lawfulness of the district court’s Remedial \nOrder.    Also  cognizable  are  issues  surrounding  the  Remedial  Opinion’s \nfindings  of  continued  deliberate  indifference  to  prisoners’  constitutional \nright  to  adequate  medical  care  and  LSP’s  compliance  with  ADA/RA \nrequirements.  Finally, the district court’s liability determination may be \nreviewed in light of the Defendants’ arguments that the court repeatedly \nfailed to apply proper Eighth Amendment and statutory standards under the \naegis of Supreme Court interpretations.10  \nTo repeat, the law of this circuit and the Supreme Court bind this \ncourt.  Abbott, Brumfield, Johnson, Morales, and Duval County control.  Those \nopinions make unmistakably clear that (1) an “order requiring that the parties \nmeet and negotiate a plan complying with the decision is itself a mandatory \ninjunction which is appealable under 28 U.S.C. § 1292(a)(1),” Morales, 535 \nF.2d at 867 n.6 (citing Duval Cnty., 326 F.2d at 618–19), and (2) appellate \njurisdiction is not lacking even if (contrary to the facts here) “we do not know \nat this point what a remedy would entail, who it would affect, and when it \nwould be implemented.”  Abbott, 585 U.S. at 601, 138 S. Ct. at 2323.  The \nRemedial  Order  and  related  Remedial  Opinion  are  appealable  under \n§ 1292(a)(1). \n_____________________ \n10 This dissent opts to cover only the Remedial Order and Opinion, intertwined \nwith PLRA noncompliance.  Although the district court’s liability findings are dubious, \nappellate review is immediately necessary to cabin the district court’s unauthorized \nimposition on prison management during the period that this appeal proceeds. \n32 \n\nCase: 23-30825      Document: 182-1     Page: 33     Date Filed: 02/12/2025\nNo. 23-30825 \nI turn to the Remedial Order’s failure to abide by the PLRA, then to \nthe district court’s Remedial Opinion. \nIII. \nThe district court’s “Remedial Order” violates the PLRA, 18 U.S.C. \n§§ 3626, et seq.  Specifically, the Remedial Order (1) constitutes injunctive \nrelief  regulated  by  the  PLRA,  § 3626(g)(7);  (2)  violates  the  PLRA’s \nprocedures  for  appointment  of  “a”—not  three—special  master(s), \n§ 3626(f)(1); (3) illegally requires the state to pay the expenses of the masters, \n§ 3626(f)(4);  and  (4)  ignores  the  PLRA’s  “needs-narrowness-\nintrusiveness” criteria for remedial orders, § 3626(a)(1).  The majority know \nabout these violations, which were fully briefed before us.  Yet they prefer to \navoid calling out the violations.  Indeed, to shield the district court from later \nreversal, even though they claim we lack jurisdiction, they telegraph the \npunches  that  “a”  special  master,  “not  multiple,”  is  required  and  that \n“intrusive[ness]” must be evaluated.  Ante at 7 n.5, 7–8.  How preposterous.  \nAnd  unauthorized.    The  Supreme  Court  condemned  the  exercise  of \nhypothetical jurisdiction decades ago.  Steel Co. v.

Ct. 250, 256 (1911); Hayburn’s Case, 2 U.S. (2 Dall.) \n408 (1792)). \nOverturning the district court’s Remedial Order for violating the \nPLRA should have been easy.  In 1996, Congress passed the PLRA to limit \nthe oversight of state prisons by federal courts.  See Pub. L. No. 104-134, 110 \nStat. 1321.  The law was enacted “in the wake of a sharp rise in prisoner \nlitigation  in  the  federal  courts,”  and  “contains  a  variety  of  provisions \ndesigned to bring this litigation under control.”  Woodford v. Ngo, 548 U.S. \n81, 84, 126 S. Ct. 2378, 2382 (2006); see also Valentine v. Collier, 993 F.3d 270, \n292–93 (5th Cir. 2021) (Oldham, J., concurring) (observing that in 1984, 24% \n33 \n\nCase: 23-30825      Document: 182-1     Page: 34     Date Filed: 02/12/2025\nNo. 23-30825 \nof state prisons were subject to federal structural injunctions).  To eliminate \nfederal  court  interference  with  state  and  local  prison  management,  the \nPLRA “established standards for the entry and termination of prospective \nrelief in civil actions challenging prison conditions.”  Miller v. French, 530 \nU.S. 327, 331, 120 S. Ct. 2246, 2251 (2000).  The PLRA reinforced the \nSupreme Court’s recognition fifty years ago that “[i]t is difficult to imagine \nan activity in which a State has a stronger interest . . . than the administration \nof its prisons.”  Preiser v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 475, 491–92, 93 S. Ct. 1827, \n1837  (1973).    Still  today,  the  Court  acknowledges  “sensitive  federalism \nconcerns”  when  federal  court  decrees  usurp  a  state’s  sovereignty  and \nauthority over its prisons.  Horne v. Flores, 557 U.S. 443, 448, 129 S. Ct. 2579, \n2593 (2009). \nIn appropriate cases, federal courts must intervene to redress ongoing \nconstitutional violations of the conditions of prisoner confinement.  See, e.g., \nGates v. Cook,  376 F.3d 323 (5th Cir. 2004).  But federal courts are bound to \napply the law Congress enacted, and the PLRA strictly limits federal court \njurisdiction and remedial power.  This court cannot be party to the district \ncourt’s refusal to abide by the PLRA. \nA. \nUnder the PLRA,“prospective relief” in prison conditions cases is \ndefined as “all relief other than compensatory money damages.”  18 U.S.C. \n§ 3626(g)(7).  It is not debatable that the district court’s Remedial Order \nconstituted  “prospective  relief.”    Viewed  most  narrowly,  the  Remedial \nOrder requires the Defendants to take the following steps: expeditiously \ncooperate with the court’s appointment of three special masters; designate \nseveral  contact  persons  between  the  masters  and  the  prison  officials  to \n“coordinate  and  facilitate”  the  special  masters’  work;  make  any  prison \nfacilities available to the special masters on 24 hours’ notice; make all records \n34 \n\nCase: 23-30825      Document: 182-1     Page: 35     Date Filed: 02/12/2025\nNo. 23-30825 \nand documents available “without delay” and within 14 days of request; and \nsecure “reasonable access to” prisoners.11  And by the way, the Remedial \nOrder requires the state of Louisiana to pay for the special masters’ services.  \nAll of these requirements are immediately effective.  The special masters’ \nreport, which will address the subjects identified in the Remedial Order and \nOpinion, just fills in details.  This Remedial Order constituted “prospective \nrelief”  and  had  to  follow  the  PLRA’s  procedural  and  substantive \nrequirements. \nB. \nIn the course of prescribing prospective relief, however, the district \ncourt paid no attention to the PLRA’s procedures for the selection of special \nmasters.  18 U.S.C. § 3626(f).  This was the source of critical errors in the \nappointment  process,  the  excessive  number  of  special  masters,  and  the \nshifting of costs to the Defendants.  Each must be addressed.  \nA “special master” is “any person appointed by a Federal court \npursuant to Rule 53 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure or pursuant to \nany inherent power of the court to exercise the powers of a master, regardless \nof the title or description given by the court.”  Id. § 3626(g)(8) (emphasis \nadded).  Under the PLRA, the special master “may be authorized by a court \nto conduct hearings” or “to assist in the development of remedial plans.”  \nId. §§ 3626(f)(6)(A), (f)(6)(C).12 \n_____________________ \n11 Insofar as it also outlines with specificity the type of defects the court found in \nenumerated areas of prison healthcare, the Defendants are on notice to “cure” the \nviolations.  \n12 In pertinent part, the relevant provisions state: \n(f) Special masters.— \n(1) In general.— \n(A) In any civil action in a Federal court with respect to prison \nconditions, the court may appoint a special master . . . .  \n(2) Appointment.— \n35 \n\nCase: 23-30825      Document: 182-1     Page: 36     Date Filed: 02/12/2025\nNo. 23-30825 \nThe Plaintiffs contend that the three special masters to be named by \nthe district court are not subject to the PLRA because they will not exercise \n“quasi-judicial power.”  See Benjamin v. Fraser, 343 F.3d 35, 39–40 (2d Cir. \n2003), overruled on other grounds by Caiozzo v. Koreman, 581 F.3d 63 (2d Cir. \n2009).13  I disagree.  The Second Circuit may have a different view of the \nroles that special masters play under the PLRA.  In that case it concluded \n_____________________ \n(A) If the court determines that the appointment of a special \nmaster is necessary, the court shall request that the defendant \ninstitution and the plaintiff each submit a list of not more than 5 \npersons to serve as a special master. \n(B) Each party shall have the opportunity to remove up to 3 \npersons from the opposing party’s list. \n(C) The court shall select the master from the persons remaining \non the list after the operation of subparagraph (B). \n(4) Compensation.— \nThe  compensation  to  be  allowed  to  a  special  master  under  this \nsection . . . shall be paid with funds appropriated to the Judiciary. \n(6) Limitations on powers and duties.—A special master appointed under \nthis subsection— \n(A) may be authorized by a court to conduct hearings and prepare \nproposed findings of act, which shall be made on the record; \n      (B) shall not make any findings or communications ex parte; \n(C) may be authorized by a court to assist in the development of \nremedial plans; and  \n(D) may be removed at any time, but shall be relieved of the \nappointment upon the termination of relief. \n(g) Definitions.—As used in this section— . . .  \n(8) the term “special master” means any person appointed by a Federal \ncourt pursuant to Rule 53 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure or \npursuant to any inherent power of the court to exercise the powers of a \nmaster, regardless of the title or description given by the court[.] \n18 U.S.C. § 3626 (emphases removed) (“Special Master Provisions”). \n13 The Plaintiffs additionally cite to a Middle District of Alabama case, Laube v. \nCampbell, 333 F. Supp. 2d 1234, 1239 (M.D. Ala. 2004).  But in that case “all parties \nconcur[red] that the PLRA’s requirements [were] met” and agreed to a settlement.  Id.  \nHere, the State vigorously argues that the PLRA’s requirements were not met and has not \nagreed to settle. \n36 \n\nCase: 23-30825      Document: 182-1     Page: 37     Date Filed: 02/12/2025\nNo. 23-30825 \nthat a consultant appointed by the district court was not subject to the PLRA \nbecause the position “serves a monitoring function; it does not exercise \nquasi-judicial power.”  Id. at 45; see also Handberry v. Thompson, 446 F.3d 335, \n352 (2d Cir. 2006) (the “special monitor” appointed by the court was not a \n“special master” because she had not “been given a mandate to exercise \nquasi-judicial powers”).  But a special master under the PLRA need not \nexercise “quasi-judicial powers.”  The scope of that office is at the court’s \ndiscretion and may specifically include “assist[ing] in the development of \nremedial plans.”  18 U.S.C. § 3626(f)(6)(C).  That is exactly what the court \nordered here.  Congress plainly did not want district courts to creatively \ndefine court-ordered consultants’ or monitors’ positions in order to evade \nthe PLRA.14  The district court’s “special masters,” “regardless of the title \nor description given by the court,” § 3626(g)(8), should have been selected \nin accordance with the PLRA. \nBut even the plaintiffs concede that the Remedial Order does not \nfollow the PLRA’s selection process: \n(A)  [T]he court shall request that the defendant institution and \nthe plaintiff each submit a list of not more than 5 persons to \nserve as a special master. \n(B)  Each party shall have the opportunity to remove up to 3 \npersons from the opposing party’s list. \n(C)  The  court  shall  select  the  master  from  the  persons \nremaining on the list . . . . \n_____________________ \n14 Plaintiffs’ additional effort to recharacterize the special masters as “experts” \nappointed under Federal Rule of Evidence 706 is misguided, because federal court rules are \nsubservient to Acts of Congress.  The district court in any event refused the Plaintiffs’ \nmotion to recharacterize the special masters, in an attempt to remedy the Remedial Order’s \nPLRA violation, after Defendants appealed.  \n37 \n\nCase: 23-30825      Document: 182-1     Page: 38     Date Filed: 02/12/2025\nNo. 23-30825 \n18 U.S.C. § 3626(f)(2).  In other words, courts must accept a list from the \nparties of at most five candidates each, whittled down by them to at least two \neach, and the court will finally select the master.  Here, the district court \nordered the parties to “meet and confer” to agree on one candidate for each \nposition, but if they are unable to agree, to “submit up to three proposed \nnames for each position.”  The district court’s order has no relationship to \nthe governing statute.  \nSecond, the Remedial Order authorizes three special masters, but the \nPLRA  authorizes  a  court  to  appoint  “a”  special  master.    18 U.S.C. \n§ 3626(f)(1)(A).  Plaintiffs attempt to defend the power to appoint three \nspecial masters because the statutory reference to “a” special master should \nenable the court to appoint three under the Dictionary Act.  1 U.S.C. § 1 \n(“[W]ords  importing  the  singular  include  and  apply  to  several  persons, \nparties, or things” “unless the context indicates otherwise[.]”).  But the \nSupreme Court cautioned in Niz-Chavez that “[t]he Dictionary Act does not \ntransform every use of the singular ‘a’ into the plural ‘several.’  Instead, it \ntells us only that a statute using the singular ‘a’ can apply to multiple persons, \nparties or things.”  Niz-Chavez v. Garland, 593 U.S. 155, 164, 141 S. Ct. 1474, \n1482 (2021).   As with all matters of statutory interpretation, context is \nparamount. \nThe Plaintiffs contend that each special master contemplated by the \ndistrict court may be “a” separate special master under the PLRA, because \nthe statute does not limit how many such persons a court may appoint.  \nAgain, “the context indicates otherwise.”  See 1 U.S.C. § 1.  As explained, \nthe PLRA’s elaborate appointment procedures for “the” special master \nrequire the parties to start from a list of ten and whittle down to one selected \nby the court.  Applying these procedures, even if the district court had done \nso, to select each of three masters would range far from the singular statutory \nreference.  Moreover, seven paragraphs in § 3626(f) refer to “a” or “the” \n38 \n\nCase: 23-30825      Document: 182-1     Page: 39     Date Filed: 02/12/2025\nNo. 23-30825 \nspecial master.  18 U.S.C. §§ 3626(f)(1)(A), (f)(1)(B), (f)(2)(A), (f)(3)–(6).  \nChanging  all  of  these  references  to  embrace  multiple  special  masters  is \nfundamentally at odds with the PLRA’s structure that cabins district court \ndiscretion in handling institutional prison litigation.  In sum, the PLRA \nauthorizes only one special master.  \nPlaintiffs also concede that the Remedial Order violates the PLRA by \nrequiring the State to pay the fees of the three special masters.  This is \nincomprehensible.  The PLRA squarely places the burden of compensating \nthe special master on federal funds appropriated to the Judiciary.  18 U.S.C. \n§ 3626(f)(4).  In fact, the special master’s hourly rate may “not [be] greater \nthan the hourly rates established under section 3006A for payment of court-\nappointed special counsel,” together with reasonable costs.  Id.  But the \ndistrict  court  required  the  Louisiana  Department  of  Corrections  to  pay \n“[a]ll” their costs, without limitation.15  Appellee’s Br. at 43 (conceding that \n“the  source  of  the  special  masters’  compensation”  would  need  to  be \nchanged). \nFinally,  and  critically,  the  Remedial  Order  fails  to  acknowledge \nsubstantive  limitations  that  the  PLRA  imposes  on  the  district  court’s \nremedial discretion.  That is,  \n[p]rospective relief . . . shall extend no further than necessary \nto correct the violation of a Federal right of a particular plaintiff \nor plaintiffs.  The court shall not grant or approve prospective \nrelief unless the court finds that such relief is narrowly drawn, \n_____________________ \n15 The State also contends that the Remedial Order violates the PLRA because it \ncalls for ex parte communications.  This complaint may refer to a Remedial Order provision \nthat designates a “Clerk” to “assist the Special Masters in retrieval of documents from the \nrecord if necessary.”  Remedial Order par. III.F.  Any ex parte communications between a \nspecial master and the court are dubious.  But the State’s argument on this point seems \npremature. \n39 \n\nCase: 23-30825      Document: 182-1     Page: 40     Date Filed: 02/12/2025\nNo. 23-30825 \nextends no further than to correct the violation of the Federal \nright, and is the least intrusive means necessary to correct the \nviolation of the Federal right.   \n18 U.S.C. § 3626(a)(1).  This threshold limitation on equitable relief has been \ndeemed  the  needs-narrowness-intrusiveness  standard.    Its  application  to \n“prospective relief” means “relief” defined in the PLRA, which is “all relief \nin  any  form  that  may  be  granted  or  approved  by  the  court . . . .”  \nId. § 3626(g)(9) (emphasis added).  Accordingly, all of the Remedial Order’s \nterms  had  to  be  justified  by  needs-narrowness-intrusiveness  findings \nrequired by § 3626(a)(1).  United States v. Hinds Cnty. Bd. of Supervisors, 120 \nF.4th  1246,  1269–70  (5th  Cir.  2024).    And,  as  with  the  attempt  to \nrecharacterize the special masters as Rule 706 experts, see supra n.14, the \ndistrict court was requested by Plaintiffs, after the Defendants appealed, to \ninclude such findings, but it refused. \nAnother substantive limit is implicit because the PLRA requires that \ninjunctive relief may be ordered only to address “the violation of the Federal \nright.”    18  U.S.C.  § 3626(a)(1)(A) (emphasis  added).    One  court  has \nconstrued this language to require a violation existing at the date relief is \nordered.  Hallett v. Morgan, 296 F.3d 732, 743 (9th Cir. 2002); compare \nDockery v. Cain, 7 F.4th 375, 380 n.4 (5th Cir. 2021) (acknowledging courts \nare split on this interpretation).  The district court here, in any event, refused \nto  consider  the  extremely  important  adoption  of  electronic  medical \nrecordkeeping, which LSP implemented after the remedial hearing but more \nthan a year before the court’s Remedial Order was entered.  As will be seen \nbelow, the availability of electronic medical records throughout LSP is a \nwatershed  occurrence  that  remedied  numerous  violations  found  by  the \ndistrict court.  Yet the court refused to adapt its proposed remedies, or the \nscope of work by special masters, to this and other ongoing reforms instituted \nby LSP. \n40 \n\nCase: 23-30825      Document: 182-1     Page: 41     Date Filed: 02/12/2025\nNo. 23-30825 \n  The district court’s violations of the PLRA are inexcusable.  Absent \nprompt action by the en banc court, the majority’s narrow approach to \nappellate finality will subject LSP to a sweeping federal intrusion into the \nprison’s management in direct violation of a binding federal statute.  And the \nconsequence of the majority’s opinion is not limited to LSP.  Other currently \npending cases exactly replicate the district court’s illegal orders in this case.  \nThe majority’s denial of appellate review makes unmistakably clear that if a \nstate or local entity in the Fifth Circuit becomes subject to a sweeping and \nillegally broad prison reform decree, this court’s doors will be closed until it \nis all but too late.   \nIV. \nAppellate  review,  whether  predicated  on  a  final  judgment  or  the \ninjunctive relief ordered by the court, encompasses the entirety of the district \ncourt’s Liability and Remedial opinions.  At this juncture, however, I will not \naddress flaws in the district court’s Liability Opinion, though the Defendants \nhave briefed their position extensively.  It is more immediately critical to \nrecount the district court’s grave errors in addressing the remedial phase of \nthe case.  The errors are of three types.  First, the Remedial Opinion and \nRemedial  Order  wholly  fail  to  apply  the  needs-narrowness-intrusiveness \nstandards for injunctive relief prescribed by § 3626(a)(1) of the PLRA.  This \ndefault alone ought to require reversal. \nThe  second  and  third  grounds  of  error  pertain  to  constitutional \nstandards for remedial relief articulated by the Supreme Court.  Second, the \ncourt refused to update its remedial analysis with evidence of critical reforms \nthat were made before the Remedial Order was entered in late 2023.  This is \ncontrary to governing Supreme Court and Fifth Circuit law.  Third, the court \napplied the wrong standard to evaluate watershed improvements in every \naspect of LSP’s medical and disabled care after the Liability Opinion issued.  \n41 \n\nCase: 23-30825      Document: 182-1     Page: 42     Date Filed: 02/12/2025\nNo. 23-30825 \nInstead,  the  court  repeatedly  held  that  whatever  the  Defendants  had \naccomplished might be “robust” or partially corrective, but it was “not \nenough” to cleanse them of deliberate indifference or remove the threat of \nDefendants’ backsliding from the improvements made.  The district court’s \napproach  reflects  a  fundamental  misunderstanding  of  the  purpose  of \ninstitutional reform injunctive relief. \n  After  the  Defendants  were  found  liable  for  Eighth  Amendment \nviolations in every aspect of medical and disabled care provided to LSP \ninmates,  they  began  systematically  to  upgrade  the  system.    The  court \nacknowledged ongoing improvements by allowing LSP to offer evidence \nfrom January 1, 2019, to May 31, 2022, before the ten-day remedial hearing \nin June 2022.  \nAnother seventeen months elapsed until the Remedial Order issued.  \nDuring that interval, the Defendants continued to upgrade medical care.  \nThey moved to supplement the record in November 2022, a year before the \ncourt’s Remedial Order, to reflect that (1) LSP implemented electronic \nhealthcare records; (2) LSP was re-accredited by the American Correctional \nAssociation; and (3) LSP hired an additional physician, doubling the number \nof physicians, and significantly raised the number of nurse practitioners.  \nReasoning that its pre-hearing discovery cutoff was just an ordinary exercise \nof trial court discretion, the court refused to consider this vital information.  \nAs a result, many provisions of the Remedial Order had become obsolete as \nsoon as it was entered.  \nThe court’s overarching error lay in this failure to evaluate whether \nprison medical and disabled care required federal court injunctive relief \ndespite continuously improved conditions.  Since the 1970s, the Supreme \nCourt  has  held  that  deliberate  indifference  to  serious  medical  needs  of \nprisoners  constitutes  the  “unnecessary  and  wanton  infliction  of  pain.”  \n42 \n\nCase: 23-30825      Document: 182-1     Page: 43     Date Filed: 02/12/2025\nNo. 23-30825 \nEstelle  v.  Gamble,  429  U.S.  97,  104,  97  S. Ct.  285,  291  (1976) (citation \nomitted).  Such mistreatment amounts to unconstitutional “punishment” \nunder the Eighth Amendment.  Williams v. Hampton, 797 F.3d 276, 281 (5th \nCir.  2015) (en  banc).    To  effectuate  liability  based  on  “punishment,” \nWilliams noted, the Supreme Court’s test for deliberate indifference adopted \na criminal standard of recklessness.  Id. (citing Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. \n925, 839–40, 114 S. Ct. 1970, 1979–80 (1994)).  The test has two parts: \nplaintiffs’ “objective exposure to a substantial risk of serious harm”; and \n“that  prison  officials  acted  or  failed  to  act  with  [subjective]  deliberate \nindifference to that risk.”  Carlucci v. Chapa, 884 F.3d 534, 538 (5th Cir. \n2018).  But, as the Supreme Court16 and this court have consistently held, \nthis quasi-criminal standard is not met for mere negligence or a failure to \nmeet a standard of community care or even gross negligence.17  In essence, \nwhen prison officials have attempted to care for a prisoner’s medical needs, \neven if the care falls short, they have not exhibited subjective deliberate \nindifference.  \n_____________________ \n16 Estelle, 429 U.S. at 105–06, 97 S.

The Supreme Court has made this abundantly clear \nfor decades.  Thus, deliberate indifference “‘should be determined in light \nof the prison authorities’ current attitudes and conduct’: their attitudes and \nconduct at the time suit is brought and persisting thereafter.”  Farmer, 511 \nU.S. at 845, 114 S. Ct. at 1983 (quoting Helling v. Mckinney, 509 U.S. 25, 36, \n113 S. Ct. 2475, 2482 (1993)); see also Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 547–48, \n562, 99 S. Ct. 1861, 1878–79, 1886 (1979).  Further, “to establish eligibility \nfor an injunction, the inmate must demonstrate the continuance of that \ndisregard during the remainder of the litigation and into the future.”  Id. at \n846.  Both sides may rely on ongoing developments in the prison to establish \nthat the inmate is not entitled to an injunction.  Id. \nCiting  Farmer,  this  court  held  that  “[w]hen  there  is  a  possible \nconstitutional violation that is likely to continue over time as in a prison \ninjunction case, we consider the evidence from the time suit is filed to the \njudgment.”  Valentine v. Collier, 993 F.3d 270, 282 (5th Cir. 2021) (emphasis \nadded).  Valentine concluded that “[i]njunctive relief is forward looking, and \ngiven the Defendants’ response [to the Covid pandemic] including actions \ntaken  on  the  eve  of  and  during  trial,  the  permanent  injunction  is  not \nwarranted.”  Id. at 289.  Even more pointedly, this court held that a district \ncourt properly considered conditions after trial when it refused to impose \ninjunctive relief in a Mississippi prison case where extensive improvements \nhad been made in the interim.  Dockery v. Cain, 7 F.4th 375, 379 (5th Cir. \n2021).  This court quoted Farmer’s admonishment that a court “should \napproach  issuance  of  injunctive  orders  with  the  usual  caution”  and \n“may . . . exercise its discretion if appropriate by giving prison officials time \nto rectify the situation before issuing an injunction.”  Id. (quoting Farmer, \n511 U.S.  at  846–47,  114  S. Ct.  at  1984).    And  we  emphasized  Farmer’s \n44 \n\nCase: 23-30825      Document: 182-1     Page: 45     Date Filed: 02/12/2025\nNo. 23-30825 \n“restrained approach” “to prevent federal courts from ‘becoming enmeshed \nin the minutiae of prison operations.’”  Id. (quoting Farmer, 511 U.S. at 847, \n114 S. Ct. at 1984 (citation omitted)).  Finally, Dockery rejected plaintiffs’ \nposition that district courts must make a risk-of-recurrence finding.  7 F.4th \nat 380.18  \nThe district court’s failure to apply these principles is unjustified.  To \nbegin, the court’s refusal to update remedial conditions from May 2022 to \nthe date of its Remedial Order in November 2023 violated Farmer, Valentine, \nand Dockery.  The district court asserted its right to manage its docket, set \ndeadlines, and protect the Plaintiffs from an endless loop of evidence.  In so \ndoing, it relied on the foregoing authorities’ acknowledgement of district \ncourt discretion.  Particularly, the court relied on the Supreme Court’s \ndecision in Brown v. Plata.  563 U.S. 493, 131 S. Ct. 1910 (2011).  Plata, a case \nabout prison overcrowding, refused to require that the state of California’s \nrequest to update remedial evidence be accepted where (1) the state had \nagreed to a pretrial discovery deadline that the lower court enforced; (2) the \nstate failed to show what additional evidence it would have submitted; and \n(3) the state’s prison medical care had been in receivership under a court \ndecree for over a decade.  Id. at 522–24, 131 S. Ct. at 1935–36.  None of the \nfacts relevant in Plata obtains in this case.  On the contrary, in this case, there \nwas an extended delay between the remedial hearing and the Remedial Order \nthat could easily have supported supplemental briefing by both parties.  The \n_____________________ \n18 See also Hallett v. Morgan, 296 F.3d 732, 743 (9th Cir. 2002) (“[I]n the absence \nof a ‘current and ongoing’ violation, there is no occasion to fashion prospective relief to \ncure the violation.  In other words, if a violation no longer exists, the statute [PLRA] does \nnot permit the court to order prospective relief.”) (citing 18 U.S.C. § 3626(a)(1)(A)).  But \ncf. Porter v. Clarke, 923 F.3d 348, 366–68 (4th Cir. 2019); Thomas v. Bryant, 614 F.3d 1288, \n1320 (11th Cir. 2010).  Both Porter and Thomas disagreed with Hallett’s reading of the \nPLRA. \n45 \n\nCase: 23-30825      Document: 182-1     Page: 46     Date Filed: 02/12/2025\nNo. 23-30825 \nDefendants explained exactly what post-hearing remedial measures had been \ntaken, had never agreed to an evidentiary cutoff date, and LSP had not been \nsubjected to court oversight prior to the remedial hearing. \nAs a result, the court’s Remedial Opinion completely ignored that as \nof autumn 2022 LSP had fully installed its electronic health records system, \nand by January 2023, the Defendants hired an additional staff physician and \nincreased the number of Nurse Practitioners from seven to nine.  These \nindisputable facts related directly to deficiencies that the court found in its \nLiability Opinion and continued to assert in the Remedial Opinion.  Indeed, \ndeficiencies in staffing and recordkeeping underlie a large number of the \ncourt’s liability findings.  If the district court’s current injunctive order takes \neffect and requires special masters to address the issues listed in the Remedial \nOrders, a significant portion of those issues were dealt with even before the \nRemedial Order issued.  Any court-appointed masters will be striking at straw \nmen, needlessly interfering with prison authorities’ duties, and running up \nbills  for  no  constitutional  remedial  purpose.    The  court’s  failure  to \nincorporate significant medical care improvements into its Remedial Opinion \nand Remedial Order violated this court’s precedents and constituted an \nabuse of discretion. \n  The court also fatally erred by finding ongoing subjective deliberate \nindifference in support of its broad injunction.  As noted above, “deliberate \nindifference is an ‘extremely high’ standard to meet.”  Brewster v. Dretke, \n587 F.3d 764, 770 (5th Cir. 2009) (quoting Gobert v. Caldwell, 463 F.3d 339, \n346 (5th Cir. 2006)).  Remedial efforts may prove insufficient to cure all the \nidentified institutional problems, but they indicate concern and sincerity on \nthe part of prison officials that negates subjective indifference.  Farmer, 511 \nU.S. at 844, 114 S. Ct. at 1982–83 (“[P]rison officials . . . may be found free \nfrom  liability  if  they  responded  reasonably  to  the  risk,  even  if  the  harm \nultimately was not averted.”) (emphasis added); Hinds Cnty., 120 F.4th at 1261 \n46 \n\nCase: 23-30825      Document: 182-1     Page: 47     Date Filed: 02/12/2025\nNo. 23-30825 \n(“A reasonable response to inadequate prison conditions is indeed sufficient \nto prevent a deliberate-indifference finding even if the County’s attempts \nwere unsuccessful or if the County did not choose the optimal approach to \nthe problem.”).  Yet the district court relied heavily on outdated and out-of-\ncircuit district court cases19 rather than this court’s multiple authorities in \nconcluding that none of LSP’s remedial measures sufficed to narrow, much \nless eliminate the need for broad ongoing injunctive relief.  In the Remedial \nOpinion, the court repeatedly acknowledged, then discounted improvements \nin the following areas of prison medical care.20   \n1. Clinical care.   The court found that LSP had remedied three out of \nfive deficiencies noted in the Liability Order, but the medical records were \nstill “in shambles.”  This problem, of course, was solved after the remedial \nhearing by electronic health records but went unacknowledged by the court.  \nThe court criticized the “episodic treatment” of medical complaints, despite \nthe hiring of an additional Nurse Practitioner and adoption of a web-based \nmedical service.  The court illustrated “constitutionally substandard care” \nby means of three examples of delayed care, “medical errors,” and a holding \n_____________________ \n19 The court quoted Laube v. Haley, 234 F. Supp. 2d 1227, 1251 (M.D. Ala. 2002), \nand cited Braggs v. Dunn, 257 F. Supp. 3d 1171, 1260 (M.D. Ala. 2017), for the proposition \nthat “efforts to correct systemic deficiencies that ‘simply do not go far enough,’ when \nweighed against the risk of harm” constitute deliberate indifference.”  Remedial Opinion, \n701 F. Supp. 3d at 435–36.  But see Hyatt v. Thomas, 843 F.3d 172, 177 (5th Cir. 2016) \n(quoting Farmer, 511 U.S. at 844, 114 S. Ct. at 1982–83) (The subjective inquiry must leave \nroom for the possibility that prison officials “responded reasonably to the risk, even if the \nharm ultimately was not averted.”).  \n20 The court made the same kind of mistakes in regard to LSP’s alleged violations \nof the ADA/RA.  The court’s analysis of “failure to accommodate” and “programmatic \naccommodations” repeatedly substitutes its view of prison management for the statutory \nstandard, which allows some institutional flexibility in providing for disabled prisoners’ \nneeds.  I omit this discussion only for the sake of brevity, not to inferentially approve the \ndistrict court’s conclusions.  \n47 \n\nCase: 23-30825      Document: 182-1     Page: 48     Date Filed: 02/12/2025\nNo. 23-30825 \nthat a “mere encounter with a medical health care provider is not evidence \nof medical care or treatment.”  These findings ignore the very high bar \nrequired to establish ongoing deliberate indifference of the Defendants. See \nDomino v. Tex. Dep’t of Crim. Just., 239 F.3d 752, 756 (5th Cir. 2001); \nValentine, 993 F.3d at 281; see also Mendoza v. Lynaugh, 989 F.2d 191, 192 (5th \nCir. 1993). \n2. Sick call.   After the Liability Opinion issued, LSP completely \noverhauled its sick call procedures to address the Opinion.  As the evidence \nshows,  each  patient  is  being  seen  within  one  day  by  an  EMT,  nurse \npractitioners became available through telemedicine, and medical records \nwere  available.    Nonetheless,  the  court  held  the  changes  had  not \n“transformed  the  system”  and,  in  the  case  of  telemedicine,  were  “not \noptimal.”  This analysis is unmoored to the rigorous Eighth Amendment \nstandard, particularly because it disregarded that substantial improvements \nshould have eliminated any finding of ongoing deliberate indifference.  See \nHinds Cnty., 120 F.4th at 1261 (citing Farmer, 511 U.S. at 844–45, 114 S. Ct. \nat 1982–83); Rasho v. Jeffreys, 22 F.4th 703, 711 (7th Cir. 2022) (Even if a \nprison  “could  have  done  more,”  corrective  efforts  “demonstrate  a \ncommitment  to  addressing  the  problem—the  antithesis  of  the  callous \ndisregard required to make out an Eighth Amendment Claim.”).   \n3. Specialty care.   LSP expanded its onsite specialty clinics from four \nto  thirteen;  made  telemedicine  consultations  available;  substantially \nincreased the number of specialty referrals and appointments and reduced \nthe  number  of  missed  appointments;  took  steps  to  schedule  and  track \nappointments more closely; installed monitors in the disabled dorms to notify \ninmates of upcoming  appointments; and  worked to coordinate care and \nprovide  adequate  follow-up  patient  care  after  specialty  workups.    This \n“framework for constitutionally adequate health care,” as the district court \ndescribed it, was still not enough.  The court instead focused on a handful of \n48 \n\nCase: 23-30825      Document: 182-1     Page: 49     Date Filed: 02/12/2025\nNo. 23-30825 \nspecific cases in which allegedly poor medical treatment occurred.  But the \nfact that some improvements may not have provided “optimal care” does \nnot detract from the important advances that were made by Defendants, \nwhich negated a legitimate finding of ongoing deliberate indifference.  See \nGobert, 463 F.3d at 349. \n4. Emergency care.   The Liability Opinion found staffing in LSP’s \nemergency  care  unit  was  constitutionally  inadequate,  after  which  LSP \nrevised its staffing.  A RN and EMT are now present 24/7, with a nurse \npractitioner either present in the unit or on-call on prison grounds 24/7.  LSP \nalso altered the policy for self-declared emergencies and limited EMTs’ \ndiscretion to ensure proper oversight.  The court acknowledged “improved \nstaffing  in  the  [emergency  unit]”  but  continued  to  find  constitutionally \ndeficient care based on seven patient files.  Again, the court failed to consider \nthat LSP’s response may be less than “transformative” but sufficient to \ndispel the notion of deliberate indifference.  See Hyatt v. Thomas, 843 F.3d \n172, 177 (5th Cir. 2016).  Nor did it apply the case law that disagreements \nover  medical  judgment  or  isolated  negligence  may  constitute  medical \nmalpractice  but  do  not  rise  to  the  level  of  quasi-criminal  deliberate \nindifference.  See Estelle, 429 U.S. at 106, 97 S. Ct. at 292; Williams, 797 F.3d \nat 281; Domino, 239 F.3d at 756. \n5.  Inpatient/Infirmary  care.      The  district  court  “commended” \nDefendants for upgrading staffing in the acute care unit to one RN for every \nten patients and one RN for every fifteen long-term care patients.  Staffing \nshortages, which led to the misuse of orderlies for nursing tasks, was the \ncourt’s concern in the Liability Opinion.  But again, the court found the \nintegration of additional trained nurses inadequate due to occasional lapses.  \nLSP also installed red call buttons outside the door of each prisoner’s locked \nroom to improve communications with nursing staff, and national guidelines \nprescribe that patients be within sight or sound of nurses.  But the court \n49 \n\nCase: 23-30825      Document: 182-1     Page: 50     Date Filed: 02/12/2025\nNo. 23-30825 \nnonetheless found the call buttons inadequate to satisfy its erroneous view of \nconstitutional standards.  See Jeffreys, 22 F.4th at 711. \n6. Medical Leadership/Organizational Structure.   It seems a dubious \nproposition that a federal court may hold that a state institution’s governing \norganizational structure—as opposed to actions of identified leaders in the \nstructure—is unconstitutional.  See Wilson, 501 U.S. at 305, 111 S. Ct. at \n2327.  But that was the import of the district court’s Liability Opinion.  \nResponding to those concerns, however, LSP fired old leaders, hired new \nleaders, and instituted new oversight procedures for prison medical care.  \nThe new healthcare administrator meets regularly with the new Deputy \nWarden, a licensed practical nurse.  LSP implemented a weekly back log \ntracker to identify delays, and the doctors meet daily with nurse practitioners \nand  LSP’s  medical  department  heads.    The  court  discounted  these \ndevelopments because, it claimed, understaffing persists, the improvements \n“simply do not go far enough,” and leadership “disagreed with several of the \nCourt’s liability findings.”  The court disagreed with LSP’s protocol for \nconducting mortality reviews.  The court also discounted changes that were \nmade  to  the  quality  assurance/quality  improvement  (“QA/QI”) \nprogramming due to the Liability Opinion’s criticism; the court held that \nLSP lacks “empirical evidence” that the program is effective.  Finally, the \ncourt  found  the  QA/QI  programming  lacked  attention  to  “remedying \nconstitutional deficiencies.”  Nonsense.  A layman may “disagree” with any \ncourt’s ruling yet not be deliberately indifferent to the patients’ needs.  And \nnothing in the court’s vague critique of the QA/QI programming identified \nexactly which “constitutional deficiencies” had to be addressed by means of \na bureaucratic program.  None of these Remedial Opinion complaints rises \nto the level of showing ongoing deliberate indifference by the Defendants.  \nSee Gobert, 463 F.3d at 346. \n50 \n\nCase: 23-30825      Document: 182-1     Page: 51     Date Filed: 02/12/2025\nNo. 23-30825 \nFor all these reasons, the district court was made aware of a substantial \nrisk of serious legal error that could arise from discounting the Defendants’ \ninnovations and improvements to prison medical care that were made during \nthe remedial phase and post-trial, but it chose to ignore the risk.  Likewise, it \nchose to ignore that ongoing improvements and innovations gave rise to a \nstrong legal likelihood that the Defendants were not guilty of continued \ndeliberate indifference.  The court, in sum, was deliberately indifferent to \nboth the evidentiary and legal framework that bound it.  This court, following \nthe  Supreme  Court,  has  maintained  a  delicate  balance  between  the \nprerogatives of public institutions and the judiciary’s limited remedial role.  \nThe court’s Remedial Order fails as a matter of law.  \nV. \nFor  these  reasons,  I  vigorously  contend  that  we  have  appellate \njurisdiction;  we  must  reverse  the  district  court’s  Remedial  Order  for \nmanifest disregard of the PLRA and governing precedent; we must seriously \nreconsider the district court’s liability findings. \n \n \n51 \n\nCase: 23-30825      Document: 182-1     Page: 52     Date Filed: 02/12/2025\n \n \n \nAppendix \n“A” \n\nCase: 23-30825      Document: 182-1     Page: 53     Date Filed: 02/12/2025\n\nCase: 23-30825      Document: 182-1     Page: 54     Date Filed: 02/12/2025\n\nCase: 23-30825      Document: 182-1     Page: 55     Date Filed: 02/12/2025\n\nCase: 23-30825      Document: 182-1     Page: 56     Date Filed: 02/12/2025\n\nCase: 23-30825      Document: 182-1     Page: 57     Date Filed: 02/12/2025\n\nCase: 23-30825      Document: 182-1     Page: 58     Date Filed: 02/12/2025",

LEBLANC, ET AL  MAGISTRATE JUDGE HORNSBY \n \n \nREPORT AND RECOMMENDATION \n \nIntroduction \n \n  The Advocacy Center, on behalf of inmates at the David Wade Correctional Center \n(“DWCC”), filed this putative class action to seek injunctive relief with respect to the \nmental health care afforded inmates who are held in extended lockdown on the south \ncompound in buildings N-1 through N-4, which are solitary confinement and extended \nlockdown tiers.  Several months before suit was filed, counsel for the Advocacy Center \nwrote DWCC and demanded that it place a litigation hold on relevant evidence, specifically \nincluding video footage from cameras located in the N tiers.   \nDiscussions were held between the Advocacy Center and prison officials about how \nto preserve and transfer the recordings.  In the midst of those discussions, Warden Jerry \nGoodwin elected to disconnect the tier cameras from hard drives that recorded the video, \nleaving the cameras as live view only.  Before the court is the Advocacy Center’s Motion \nfor Preliminary Injunction (Doc. 45) that asks the court to order prison officials to restore \nthe video storage capacity of the tier cameras and provide copies of all video to the \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 93   Filed 08/23/18   Page 2 of 12 PageID #:  1564\nAdvocacy Center.  For the reasons that follow, it is recommended that the motion be \ndenied. \nScope of the Motion and Hearing \n  The motion for preliminary injunction (Doc. 45) and memorandum in opposition \n(Doc. 49) set out the relevant facts in considerable detail and include supporting affidavits \nand other exhibits.  The undersigned held a conference to discuss the motion.  Counsel \nexpressed general agreement that the principal issues—whether the court can and should \norder DWCC to reactivate recording of the tier cameras and provide the plaintiffs copies \nof the recordings—are primarily legal issues.   \nPlaintiffs stated that they would like to present witnesses and evidence relevant to \npotential remedies, such as the relative cost and burden of proposed technical solutions.  \nThey were afforded that opportunity when the court held an evidentiary hearing on June \n28, 2018.  The evidence received at the hearing was largely consistent with the earlier \nwritten submissions.  A summary of the relevant facts are set forth below.   \nThe court also discussed at the prehearing conference that any claim of spoliation \nand related remedies was not at issue in connection with the motion for prospective \ninjunctive relief.  It would be more appropriate to address such matters after motion \npractice and any required factual development that targets the spoliation issues.  Minutes \nat Doc. 56, pg. 2.    \nRelevant Facts \n  DWCC is divided into two compounds: north and south.  The south compound is \ncomprised of five buildings designated as N-1 through N-4, and H-5.  Buildings in N-1 \nPage 2 of 12 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 93   Filed 08/23/18   Page 3 of 12 PageID #:  1565\nthrough N-4 house offenders assigned to restrictive housing or maximum custody due to \ndisciplinary issues or classification designations. \n  These housing units are often referred to as tiers.  They are long hallways with cells \nalong the side.  There is a shower area, referred to by some of the witnesses as a shower \ncage, where restraints are removed after the inmate is inside the shower.  There is also a \nlobby area, and officers control access and communications from a key room or control \nroom. \n  Beginning in the mid-2000’s, the prison installed video cameras to monitor the tiers \nin N-1 through N-4.  The tier cameras were aimed down the hallways and did not capture \nvideo of the inside of cells (except for a few cells set aside for suicide watch).  The cameras \ndo not capture any audio.  Warden Jerry Goodwin and other witnesses testified that the \npurpose of the cameras was to ensure that officers were making rounds at the appropriate \ntimes. The prison was not required by law or DOC policy to maintain the cameras.  Warden \nGoodwin and other prison officials testified that rounds are now monitored by a card swipe \nsystem that requires an officer to swipe an identification card at the end of a tier to mark \nhis presence at a certain time. \n  The tier cameras are motion activated and, until recently, recorded to hard drives in \nfive-minute increments.  Once the hard drives were filled, the cameras automatically began \nto overwrite existing footage with new video footage.  It has often been said that the hard \ndrives stored the last 30 days of footage, but that was a mere estimate that depended on \nhow often the motion sensors activated  to commence a five-minute recording.  Witnesses \ntestified that, beginning in February 2017, oscillating fans were installed in N-1 through \nPage 3 of 12 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 93   Filed 08/23/18   Page 4 of 12 PageID #:  1566\nN-4, and their motion often triggered the sensors on the cameras.  This resulted in the hard \ndrives filling up much faster, so that they held only about 12 to 20 days of recordings. \n  The Advocacy Center is authorized by federal law to investigate abuse and neglect \nof people with disabilities, which disabilities include mental illness. The Center began \ninvestigating complaints of abuse and neglect of inmates with mental illness in solitary \nconfinement and extended lockdown at DWCC.  Counsel for the Advocacy Center sent a \nletter to the prison on July 7, 2017 that advised officials that it was their obligation to \npreserve documents and things for discovery in the dispute, even though a complaint had \nnot yet been filed.  The letter explained that a party who reasonably anticipates litigation \nmust suspend its routine document destruction policy and place a litigation hold to ensure \nthe preservation of relevant documents, lest it be charged with spoliation of evidence.  The \nletter specifically asked the prison to preserve video footage from any cameras located in \nthe N tiers, including but not limited to hallway cameras, from May 26, 2017 and all dates \ngoing forward.  The letter asked that the prison discontinue all data destruction and backup \ntape recycling policies, and that officials preserve relevant hardware unless an exact replica \nof the file was made.  Doc. 45, Exhibit A.  This led to discussions between the Advocacy \nCenter and state officials.   \nThere was also a disagreement about the ability of Advocacy Center attorneys to \naccess DWCC and its prisoners.  That dispute led to a lawsuit in the Middle District of \nLouisiana and, later, a settlement agreement.  The agreement provided that the Advocacy \nCenter and the DOC would establish a protocol for requesting and transferring tier video \nrecordings that were then in possession of the State’s consolidated information technology \nPage 4 of 12 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 93   Filed 08/23/18   Page 5 of 12 PageID #:  1567\nservice  in  the  Division  of  Administration’s  Office  of  Information  Technology.    The \nagreement was based on the Advocacy Center’s belief that the IT office held the video \nrecordings from the DWCC tiers at issue.  It was eventually learned that the tier cameras \nrecorded  only  to  local  hard  drives  at  DWCC  and  were  not  backed  up  or  otherwise \ntransmitted to the IT office.  \n  Additional discussions were had about how the Advocacy Center might obtain \ncopies of the tier recordings.  Prison officials expressed concerns about the time and effort \ninvolved in sending the information to the Advocacy Center lawyers.  The Center proposed \nto send hard drives to the prison that could be programmed to regularly back up the video \nrecordings.  Warden Goodwin requested time to consider the proposal.  When the parties \nmet again, Warden Goodwin said that he had decided to disconnect the tier cameras from \nthe hard drives that stored video.  The only cameras in the area that would continue to \nrecord to a hard drive were those in the suicide cells.  Tier cameras would provide live feed \nonly, and Goodwin said he had put his decision into effect a few days earlier.  \n  Warden Goodwin testified at the hearing that the DOC began, in mid-2017, to \nrequire body cameras or portable cameras be used to record planned use of force incidents.  \nDWCC received body cameras sometime during 2017, although witnesses varied in their \nrecollection of when those body cameras arrived.  The body cameras are small, clip-on \ndevices that record in high definition and capture audio.  All supervisors (meaning captains \nand majors) wear a body camera during their entire shift.  The officers are able to activate \nand deactivate the cameras with a press of a button.  The recordings are downloaded to a \nhard drive and stored at the end of a shift. \nPage 5 of 12 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 93   Filed 08/23/18   Page 6 of 12 PageID #:  1568\n  Warden Goodwin testified at the hearing that his decision to cease storing video \nfrom the tier cameras had nothing to do with this lawsuit.  He said it was based on the fact \nthat tier camera recordings were no longer required to monitor whether officers conducted \ntheir rounds on schedule.  As for use of force incidents, he said that he believed the new \nbody cameras were much better suited for reviewing the incidents. \n  Warden Goodwin said that he initially thought he would move the tier cameras to \nother parts of the prison, such as general population, where there was more traffic and \ngreater need for surveillance.  He then got a grant to buy more cameras, which allowed him \nto place new cameras in the dorms and keep the tier cameras as live feeds.  The tier cameras \nare still in place, but they are now live-feed only with no storage. \n  The court heard testimony from inmates Tyler Blanchard and Jeremy Ricard.  Both \nmen were behavioral problems at other facilities, and each testified that he is bipolar and \nschizophrenic.  They were transferred to DWCC, which is among three state prisons \ndesigned to house the most troublesome inmates.  Both men have lengthy histories of \ndisciplinary write-ups.  Blanchard and Ricard each testified about separate incidents at \nDWCC where chemical spray was applied to them.  Both incidents were recorded by body \ncameras (after the tier cameras were disabled from recording).     \nThe court watched video from the body cameras of both incidents, and it heard \ntestimony from the officers and inmates who were involved.  It is not necessary to explore \nthe details of the incidents.  The main points to be taken from the evidence are that the \nbody cameras do a good job of capturing high-definition video in the direction in which \nthe cameras are pointed.  Other advantages of the body cameras are that they record audio \nPage 6 of 12 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 93   Filed 08/23/18   Page 7 of 12 PageID #:  1569\nand record events that happen inside cells, where witnesses testified most use of force \nincidents occur.  The tier cameras show only a fixed view of the hallway outside the cells, \nand they do not capture audio.   \nPlaintiffs pointed out that recordings from the tier cameras could provide important \ncontext to understand what was happening inside the cells.  For example, time-stamps from \nthe two recording systems could provide information such as how long an officer was \ninside a cell before he activated his body camera.  The tier recordings could also reflect \nmatters such as the allegations of the inmate witnesses that inmates had their heads \nsmashed against the wall or were dragged down the hall, incidents that are not necessarily \ncaptured by the body camera recording because of the close proximity of the camera and \nthe direction in which it is pointing.  The tier recordings would arguably provide better or \nadditional evidence of such incidents. \n  Michael Harvey is a consultant who has worked with the Advocacy Center in its \nefforts to secure copies of recordings from DWCC.  He visited the prison and made copies \nof the drives that were available before they were disabled.  The drives for cameras on N-\n1 and N-2 had significant errors, which made it very time consuming to recover the data.  \nSeveral thousand videos on the N-3 drive were found in a recycle bin.  Plaintiffs suggested \nthat this demonstrated that DWCC’s backup system was not reliable, so the Advocacy \nCenter needs to install its own reliable system to capture the recordings.  \n  Mr. Harvey said that it took him about 40 hours to copy six hard drives.  The 40 \nhours was not all hands-on time, and it included delay due to a computer timing out during \nthe process.  The defense argued that this showed the difficulty of constantly making \nPage 7 of 12 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 93   Filed 08/23/18   Page 8 of 12 PageID #:  1570\nbackups for the Plaintiffs as requested, but Mr. Harvey said that the process he used was a \n“world of difference” from what was proposed for the copying system at issue on this \nmotion.  Defense counsel questioned Mr. Harvey about whether the Advocacy Center’s \nproposal included the means for DWCC to store a copy for itself.  Mr. Harvey said DWCC \nwould need to purchase drives, and he estimated that about 96 terabytes would cover the \ntime at issue.  He conceded that the proposal did not provide for the expense of data \nrecovery or other issues if there were technical problems.  He said his usual charge for such \nwork is $120 per hour, but he is charging only $60 per hour in this case.  There was other \ntestimony that such consultants charge about $150 per hour.  \n  Jacob Trupiano is an IT professional who works for the Division of Administration \nand is primarily stationed at DWCC.  He testified that he bought the last tier cameras in \n2014, and they are models 600TDL.  He testified that the storage required would be much \ngreater than estimated by Mr. Harvey.  He estimated that about 12 terabytes would be used \nevery two weeks or so.  The prison would have to purchase hard drives to store video if it \nwanted to keep a copy of what it gave to the Advocacy Center.  Mr. Trupiano testified that, \ncontrary  to  what  Mr.  Harvey  suggested,  the  camera  system  they  have  could  not \nsimultaneously record video from one camera to two different hard drives (which would \nsimultaneously make a copy for the prison and for the Advocacy Center).  Staff would have \nto copy the hard drives like Mr. Harvey did before, and they would need a third hard drive \nto record from the cameras during that copying process.   \n \n \nPage 8 of 12 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 93   Filed 08/23/18   Page 9 of 12 PageID #:  1571\nAnalysis \n  An initial issue is what law governs the request for relief.  In Humble Oil & Refining \nCompany v. Harang, 262 F. Supp. 39 (E.D. La. 1966), Judge Rubin addressed a request for \na preliminary injunction to prevent a party from destroying records that the plaintiff sought \nin discovery.  The court analyzed the request under the traditional factors relevant to \nwhether a preliminary injunction should issue.  Under current law, a party seeking a \npreliminary injunction must show (1) a substantial likelihood of success on the merits, (2) \na substantial threat of irreparable injury absent an injunction, (3) that the threatened injury \nwould exceed any harm that would flow from the injunction, and (4) that the injunction \nwould not undermine the public interest.  Walgreen Co. v. Hood, 275 F.3d 475, 477 (5th \nCir. 2001).   \n  Some district courts within this circuit have followed that approach.  See, e.g., \nMadden v. Wyeth, 2003 WL 21443404 (N.D. Tex. 2003); Hunter v. Sterling, 2009 WL \n4348660 (M.D. La. 2009).  But other courts have criticized the approach, nothing that \nmotions for preservation of documents and similar discovery orders have become widely \nused in the place of injunctions since the time of Humble Oil.  The four-prong test that \ntypically applies to requests for injunctive relief does not necessarily fit well with a request \nfor  a  preservation  order,  given  that  proof of  probability  of  success  in  litigation  and \nconsideration of the public interest are not consistent with or relevant to such requests.  \nCapricorn Power Co., Inc. v. Siemens Westinghouse Power Corp., 220 F.R.D. 429 (W.D. \nPenn. 2004). \nPage 9 of 12 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 93   Filed 08/23/18   Page 10 of 12 PageID #:  1572\n  Capricorn suggested three factors be used when deciding a motion to preserve \ndocuments or other things:  (1)  the level of the concern the court has for the continuing \nexistence and maintenance of the integrity of the evidence in the absence of an order \ndirecting preservation; (2) any irreparable harm likely to result to the parties seeking the \npreservation of evidence absent the order; and (3) the capability of a party or other person \nto maintain the evidence sought to be preserved, including the financial and other burdens \ncreated by ordering preservation.  Capricorn Power, 220 F.R.D. at 433-34. \n  This case presents a new twist so it does not fit easily under either approach.  \nPlaintiffs are not merely asking that the court order prison officials to preserve evidence \nthat it has in its possession or is routinely generating.  Plaintiffs are asking that the court \norder prison officials to create evidence—recordings—that are no longer being made at \nthe prison.  It is a rather extraordinary request that a defendant be ordered to continually \nrecord its actions on a going-forward basis, make copies of those recordings, and share \nthem with its opponent in litigation.  Plaintiffs have argued why the recordings would be \nhelpful to monitor interactions between inmates and officers, and they urge that the burden \non the Defendants would not be great, but they have not cited any decision where a court \nhas ordered or upheld the granting of similar relief. \n  The scope of the litigation must be kept in mind.  Plaintiffs’ complaint asks for \ncertification of a class of all prisoners who are or will be subjected to extended lockdown \nat DWCC, and a subclass of all individuals on extended lockdown at DWCC who have or \nare perceived as having a qualifying disability related to mental health.  The complaint asks \nfor injunctive relief with respect to the health care afforded such persons.  The matters at \nPage 10 of 12 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 93   Filed 08/23/18   Page 11 of 12 PageID #:  1573\nissue include the adequacy of mental health staffing, screening, and treatment.  The claims \nare based primarily on the Eighth Amendment, the Americans with Disabilities Act, and \nSection 504 of the Rehabilitation Act.   \nThus, the case has a particular scope and focus.  It is not a general forum to litigate \nall perceived wrongs committed at DWCC on the tiers after the complaint was filed.  Yet \nmuch of the argument by Plaintiffs appears to justify their request for recordings based on \nthe ability of the recordings to help establish individual incidents/claims of excessive force \nor retaliation, more than relevance to the adequacy of mental health care at the prison.  \nThere is some overlap among the issues, but access to tier recordings after suit was filed \nwill be of limited benefit in proving the central elements of the claims presented in the \ncomplaint.  \nAs stated above, the issue now before the court is not spoliation, which is not yet \nripe for decision. The issue is also not Warden Goodwin’s credibility about the reason he \nstopped recording with the tier cameras soon after the claims at issue were presented.  That \nassessment will be for the finder of fact at trial.  The only issues are whether the court can \nand should issue an injunction that requires DWCC officials to resume recording with the \ntier cameras and share those recordings with the Advocacy Center attorneys.  The relief \nrequested is extraordinary, and Plaintiffs have cited no decision in which similar relief has \nbeen granted.  The tier recordings would appear to be of limited relevance to the central \nissues presented in the complaint, and similar and often better HD video (with audio) \nrecordings of particular incidents are available via the body camera system now in place. \nPage 11 of 12 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 93   Filed 08/23/18   Page 12 of 12 PageID #:  1574\nConsidering  these  and  the  other  factors  discussed  above,  the  undersigned  finds  that \nPlaintiffs are not entitled to the relief they request in this motion for preliminary injunction.  \n  Accordingly, \n  IT IS RECOMMENDED that Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction \n(Doc. 45) be denied. \nObjections \n \n  Under the provisions of 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1)(C) and Fed.

Men at David Wade Correctional Center (hereinafter “DWCC”) are being held in \nextreme, abusive conditions.  They are held in prolonged solitary confinement or extended \nlockdown for months and years, often unable to go outside for weeks on end.  There is no external \n1 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 316   Filed 03/13/20   Page 2 of 59 PageID #:  5433\nsensory  stimulation—no  television,  no  radio,  and  little  human  contact.  Men  held  in  these \nconditions are allowed to place one phone call per month to someone in the outside world.  \n2.  These extreme conditions create mental illness, and exacerbate pre-existing mental \nillness, causing psychotic decompensation and propensity for acts of self- harm. Some people hear \nvoices, or talk and scream to themselves. Some engage in cutting themselves and attempting \nsuicide to escape the extreme conditions. Two men have sliced open their testicles and one \nattempted to cut off his ear. Another man climbed a barbed-wire fence and attempted suicide by \ndiving off headfirst. Others bang their heads against the walls. The people confined at David Wade \nare at immediate risk of harm without this Court’s intervention. \n3.  Prisoners are placed in extended lockdown, either in a double bunk cell or a more \nrestrictive solitary cell, without regard to whether they are already at risk for mental illness, \ndecompensation,  or  self-harm.    Once  on  extended  lockdown,  people  with  mental  illness \ndecompensate and symptoms become more severe. Staff then respond to symptoms of mental \nillness by using restraint chains on people in cells, chaining people to wooden restraint chairs, \nusing chemical spray on people in cells, issuing additional write-ups or criminal charges, taking \naway outdoor time, moving prisoners to more extreme isolation, and taking away all clothing, \nreading material, and mattresses as punishment.  \n4.  Virtually no mental health care is provided to prisoners on extended lockdown, \naside from scattershot, poorly administered and inconsistent medication. What minimal contact \nprisoners at David Wade have with a psychiatrist at the prison occurs once every three to six \nmonths, lasts less than ten minutes and is supervised by a security officer in the room. If prisoners \nat David Wade request mental health care they are placed on “suicide watch” which means that \nthey are stripped of clothing and belongings, and held in a solitary confinement cell on the \n2 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 316   Filed 03/13/20   Page 3 of 59 PageID #:  5434\ndisciplinary tier for weeks. Suicide watch is only provided on the disciplinary tiers. There is no \nlesser intervention provided and no otherwise functioning sick call or grievance system available \nto seek mental health care.  \n5.  Plaintiffs bring this action for injunctive and declaratory relief to remedy the \ndestructive cycle imposed by Defendants in which prisoners suffer breakdowns due to untreated \nmental illness under harsh and brutal conditions, Defendants respond with punitive suicide watch \ninstead of treatment, Defendants ignore the worsening symptoms of mental illness, and then \nDefendants punish those who speak out or act out due to lack of treatment.  This cycle continues \nuntil the prisoner is either totally unable to care for himself and has to be transferred out of the \nprison into an acute care facility or is released on to the street.  This lawsuit seeks to enjoin the \nfailed systems that deprive prisoners of their rights to humane, civilized conditions of confinement. \n6.  Plaintiff, the Advocacy Center of Louisiana (“Advocacy Center”), Louisiana’s \nprotection and advocacy system for persons with Mental Illness and Plaintiffs Bruce Charles, \nCarlton Turner, Larry Jones, and Ronald Brooks, each an individual with a disability and prisoner \nof DWCC, bring this action under Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA), 42 \nU.S.C. § 12131 et seq.; Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (Section 504), 29 U.S.C. § 794, and \n42 U.S.C. § 1983 to remedy violations of the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution.  \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n7.  Plaintiffs bring this action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and 42 U.S.C. § 12131 et \nseq., and 29 U.S.C. § 794. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § \n1331, § 1343, and § 2201. \n3 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 316   Filed 03/13/20   Page 4 of 59 PageID #:  5435\n8.  Venue is proper in this district pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b), because many of \nthe events or omissions complained of occurred here, the Department of Public Safety and \nCorrections is headquartered here, and the Defendant Secretary resides here.  \nPARTIES \nA.   DEFENDANTS \n9.  Defendant James LeBlanc is the Secretary of the Louisiana Department of Public \nSafety and Corrections (“DPS&C”). Secretary LeBlanc is ultimately responsible for the control, \noversight, and functioning of all programs and facilities within the DPS&C, including David Wade \nCorrectional Center. He formulates, directs, and maintains all regulations of the DPS&C, and \ndetermines the DPS&C’s policies regarding management, personnel, and total operations. This \nincludes ultimate determination of facilities and conditions in which the DPS&C houses people \nwith mental illness. Defendant LeBlanc directs the DPS&C’s central office and field staff, which \nare charged with carrying out the work of the agency. He is responsible for protecting the \nconstitutional and statutory rights of all persons held by the DPS&C, including at David Wade \nCorrectional Center.  Defendant LeBlanc is the final policymaker with regard to the conditions at \nDWCC. He has implemented or supported the implementation of the policies that cause harm to \nPlaintiffs, and has failed to implement additional policies that would prevent harm to Plaintiffs. \nHe has oversight authority over DWCC, which he has failed to exercise to prevent harm to \nPlaintiffs.  At all times relevant to this Complaint he was acting under color of law and in his \nofficial capacity.  \n10.  Defendant Jerry Goodwin is the Warden over David Wade Correctional Center. He \nis responsible for control over DWCC and makes all final staffing, budget, and administrative \ndecisions that are not otherwise made by Defendant LeBlanc. He is responsible for the safety and \n4 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 316   Filed 03/13/20   Page 5 of 59 PageID #:  5436\ncare of all persons held at David Wade Correctional Center and is responsible for protecting and \nimplementing prisoners’ statutory and constitutional rights. He oversees disciplinary actions and \ndecisions, housing decisions, and the supervision of and care for people with serious mental illness. \nHe  personally  sets  and  implements  policies  that  cause  the  onset  of  mental  illness,  mental \ndecompensation, and harm to Plaintiffs. He is sued in his official capacity.   \n11.  Defendant Lonnie Nail is a Colonel at DWCC. Nail has final authority over \noperations of the “south side” of the facility, which houses the extended lockdown and solitary \nconfinement populations at DWCC, including Plaintiffs and the proposed class members. Upon \ninformation and belief he answers only to Defendants Warden Goodwin and Secretary LeBlanc. \nHe participates in and supervises disciplinary actions and decisions, staffing decisions, housing \ndecisions, and supervision of and care for people with serious mental illness. He personally sets \nand implements policies that cause harm to Plaintiffs, including causing decompensation and the \nonset of mental illness. He is sued in his official capacity.  \n12.  Defendant  Doctor  Gregory  Seal,  M.D.  is  a  contract  psychiatrist  at  DWCC. \nDefendant Seal fails to adequately treat and care for Plaintiffs and proposed class members. He \nimplements treatment and non-treatment decisions that cause mental deterioration and harm to \nPlaintiffs and proposed class members. He is sued in his official capacity.  \n13.  Defendant Assistant Warden Deborah Dauzat is the Mental Health Director at \nDWCC. She is a Licensed Clinical Social Worker and a Board Approved Clinical Supervisor. She \nparticipates in hiring of mental health staff. Defendant Dauzat fails to adequately supervise the \nmental health staff and oversee treatment planning. Defendant Dauzat fails to ensure that mental \nhealth services and programs are adequate to address the serious needs of Plaintiffs and proposed \nclass  members.  She  implements  treatment  and  non-treatment  decisions  that  cause  mental \n5 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 316   Filed 03/13/20   Page 6 of 59 PageID #:  5437\ndeterioration and harm to Plaintiffs and proposed class members. She is sued in her official \ncapacity.  \n14.  Defendant Steve Hayden is a Corrections Program Manager 2 at DWCC. He holds \na Master’s Degree in Industrial Psychology. Defendant Hayden fails to adequately treat and care \nfor Plaintiffs and proposed class members, and provides clinical care without being licensed to do \nso. He implements treatment and non-treatment decisions that cause mental deterioration and harm \nto Plaintiffs and proposed class members. He is sued in his official capacity.  \n15.  Defendant Aerial Robinson is a Social Services Counselor 1 at DWCC. She \nimplements treatment and non-treatment decisions that cause mental deterioration and harm to \nPlaintiffs and proposed class members. Defendant Robinson is a Licensed Clinical Social Worker. \nDefendant Robinson fails to adequately treat and care for Plaintiffs and proposed class members. \nShe is sued in her official capacity.  \n16.  Defendant Johnie Adkins is employed by DWCC as a Social Services Counselor I. \nIn that capacity, he conducts interviews with inmates on suicide watch, conducts PREA interviews \nfollowing a sexual assault, and informs inmates of the passing of relatives. He fails to adequately \ntreat and care for Plaintiffs and proposed class members. He provides clinical care without being \nlicensed to do so, and his decisions cause harm to Plaintiffs and proposed class members. He is \nsued in his official capacity.  \n17.  The Department of Public Safety and Corrections (“DPS&C”) is the administrative \narm of the State of Louisiana responsible for administering the state’s correctional facilities, \nincluding DWCC where Plaintiffs are incarcerated. The DPS&C is an instrumentality of the State \nof Louisiana. The DPS&C is responsible for each of the actions and inactions complained of \n6 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 316   Filed 03/13/20   Page 7 of 59 PageID #:  5438\nherein. The DPS&C is a recipient of federal funding. The DPS&C as an entity is sued pursuant to \nthe ADA and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act only.  \nB.   PLAINTIFFS  \nTHE ADVOCACY CENTER \n18.  Plaintiff  ADVOCACY  CENTER  is  a  private,  federally-funded,  non-profit \ncorporation, designated by Louisiana to serve as the State’s protection and advocacy system for \npersons with mental illness. \n19.  Plaintiff Advocacy Center is part of a nationwide network of disability rights \nagencies created under federal law to provide legal representation and other advocacy services on \nbehalf of persons with disabilities (“Protection and Advocacy” organizations). See Protection and \nAdvocacy of Individual Rights Program of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. § 794e \n(2009); Protection and Advocacy for Individuals with Mental Illness (“PAIMI”) Act of 1986, 42 \nU.S.C. §10801 et seq. (2009); Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act of \n2000,  42  U.S.C.  §§15041-45  (2009).  Pursuant  to  these  statutes,  Protection  and  Advocacy \norganizations are authorized to investigate incidents of abuse or neglect of such persons, to enforce \nthe federal and state constitutional and statutory rights of such persons through administrative, \nlegal, and other appropriate remedies, and to provide information and referrals relating to programs \nand services addressing the needs of such persons. \n20.  The  Advocacy  Center  has  associational  standing  to  bring  this  lawsuit.  The \nAdvocacy Center is the functional equivalent of a voluntary membership organization that was \ncreated by Congress to protect and advocate for its Louisiana constituents. The Advocacy Center's \nLouisiana Constituents possess sufficient indicia of membership to represent its constituents in \nthis suit.  These indicia of membership are based on the role of the federally mandated Protection \n7 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 316   Filed 03/13/20   Page 8 of 59 PageID #:  5439\n& Advocacy for Individuals with Mental Illness Advisory Council (hereinafter “PAIMI Council”) \nin guiding the work and priorities of the Advocacy Center.  \n21.  Constituents  of  the  Advocacy  Center  include  DWCC  prisoners  on  extended \nlockdown who have or may have in the future a mental illness or emotional impairment and who \nare being abused, neglected and subject to civil rights violations.  The scope of the harm suffered \nby  the  Advocacy  Center’s  constituents  includes  the  denial  of  Constitutionally  guaranteed \nappropriate mental health treatment and discrimination on the basis of their disabilities.  \n22.  The  Advocacy  Center  publishes  the  annual  PAIMI  Program  Priorities  and \nObjectives on its website inviting Constituents to comment on their relative importance to its \nstatutory charge to protect and advocate for individuals with mental illness. \n23.  The Advocacy Center has a governing board of directors, which is composed of \nmembers who broadly represent and who are knowledgeable about the needs of individuals with \nmental illness. The Advocacy Center's board of directors includes members who have received or \nare receiving mental health services or family members of directors who have received or are \nreceiving mental health services. \n24.  In addition to a governing board, Plaintiff Advocacy Center has an advisory board \nknown as a “PAIMI Council.” At least sixty percent of these PAIMI Council members have \nreceived or are receiving mental health services or are family members of such individuals; the \nPAIMI Council also includes mental health professionals and individuals from the public who are \nknowledgeable about mental illness. Because many people on the PAIMI Council have family \nmembers with mental health issues, it is not surprising that some of those family members have \nended up in the criminal justice system, and inevitable that such involvement will continue. \n8 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 316   Filed 03/13/20   Page 9 of 59 PageID #:  5440\n25.  Plaintiff Advocacy Center has met with persons who have been incarcerated at \nDWCC and has investigated serious claims of abuse. The current litigation at DWCC is the product \nof an investigation by the Advocacy Center under the authority conferred by the federal PAIMI \nstatute into allegations of systemic violations of the basic constitutional and statutory rights of \nprisoners with mental illness on extended lockdown. \n26.  The named Plaintiffs and each member of the sub-class that is defined in this \ncomplaint is a constituent of the Advocacy Center and has suffered, and/or is continuing to suffer, \nan injury that would allow him or her to bring suit in his or her own right. Many of the persons \nincarcerated at DWCC are without either relatives or friends with whom they are in contact while \nin prison and many are not capable of expressing their legal needs or advocating for themselves \ndue to their mental illness. Individuals who cannot advocate for themselves and lack outside \nsupport have no one other than the Advocacy Center to act on their behalf in civil matters. \n27.  Plaintiff Advocacy Center brings this suit as an associational plaintiff on behalf of \nall prisoners with disabilities related to mental health, or who are perceived as having such \ndisabilities, currently held, or who will in the future be held, in extended lockdown at DWCC in \nN-1, N-2, N-3, and N-4. \nCLASS REPRESENTATIVES \n28.  Plaintiff  BRUCE  CHARLES  is  a  prisoner  housed  in  extended  lockdown  at \nDWCC.  Mr. Charles has been in DWCC custody since June 2016 and has been housed on \nextended lockdown since then.  He was diagnosed with bipolar disorder prior to his incarceration \nand that diagnosis was recognized during his placement at the Dixon, Hunt, and Allen state \ncorrectional facilities prior to his transfer to DWCC.  Mr. Charles is a person with a disability as \ndefined in 42 U.S.C. § 12102 and 29 U.S.C. § 705(9).  Mr. Charles is being exposed to inhumane \n9 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 316   Filed 03/13/20   Page 10 of 59 PageID #:  5441\nconditions in violation of the Eighth Amendment.  He is also being denied adequate mental health \ntreatment  and  reasonable  accommodations  for  his  disabilities  under  the  Americans  with \nDisabilities Act and § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.  Mr. Charles is a representative of the \nputative class as well as the subclass. \n29.  Plaintiff CARLTON TURNER is a prisoner housed in extended lockdown at \nDWCC.  Mr. Turner has been in DWCC custody since May 2011 and has been housed on extended \nlockdown continuously since 2016.  He has a history of depression and was diagnosed with \nschizoaffective disorder in 2007.  Mr. Turner is a person with a disability as defined in 42 U.S.C. \n§ 12102 and 29 U.S.C. § 705(9).  Mr. Turner is being exposed to inhumane conditions in violation \nof the Eighth Amendment.  He is also being denied adequate mental health treatment and \nreasonable accommodations for his disabilities under the Americans with Disabilities Act and § \n504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.  Mr. Turner is a representative of the putative class as well \nas the subclass. \n30.  Plaintiff LARRY JONES is a prisoner housed in extended lockdown at DWCC.  \nMr. Jones has been in DWCC custody since November 2017 and has been housed on extended \nlockdown continuously since.  He has a history of depression and bi-polar disorder.  Mr. Jones is \na person with a disability as defined in 42 U.S.C. § 12102 and 29 U.S.C. § 705(9).  Mr. Jones is \nbeing exposed to inhumane conditions in violation of the Eighth Amendment.  He is also being \ndenied adequate mental health treatment and reasonable accommodations for his disabilities under \nthe Americans with Disabilities Act and § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.  Mr. Jones is a \nrepresentative of the putative class as well as the subclass. \n31.  Plaintiff RONALD BROOKS is a prisoner housed in extended lockdown at \nDWCC.  Mr. Brooks has been in DWCC custody since June 2018 and has been housed on extended \n10 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 316   Filed 03/13/20   Page 11 of 59 PageID #:  5442\nlockdown continuously except for approximately two weeks in general population.  He has a \nhistory of depressive episodes with psychotic features and post-traumatic stress disorder.  Mr. \nBrooks is a person with a disability as defined in 42 U.S.C. § 12102 and 29 U.S.C. § 705(9).  Mr. \nBrooks is being exposed to inhumane conditions in violation of the Eighth Amendment.  He is also \nbeing denied adequate mental health treatment and reasonable accommodations for his disabilities \nunder the Americans with Disabilities Act and § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.  Mr. Brooks \nis a representative of the putative class as well as the subclass. \n32.  Plaintiffs bring this action under 42 U.S.C. §1983, for violations of the First and \nEighth Amendments to the United States Constitution on behalf of all prisoners currently held, or \nwho will in the future be held, in extended lockdown at DWCC in the N-1, N-2, N-3, and N-4 \nbuildings. \n33.  Plaintiffs also bring this action under the ADA and Section 504 on behalf of a sub-\nclass consisting of all individuals on extended lockdown at David Wade Correctional Center who \nhave or are perceived as having a qualifying disability related to mental health, as defined within \nthe Americans with Disabilities Act and Section 504. This sub-class includes all individuals who \ndevelop such a mental illness during the duration of time they are incarcerated in extended \nlockdown. On behalf of the sub-class, Plaintiffs advance claims pursuant to the First and Eighth \nAmendments as well as the ADA and Section 504.  \n \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \nA.  The Physical Plant of Lockdown Units at David Wade Correctional Center \n11 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 316   Filed 03/13/20   Page 12 of 59 PageID #:  5443\n34.  David  Wade  Correctional  Center  is  divided  into  two  compounds:  the  North \nCompound and the South Compound. The South Compound is comprised of five buildings, N-1 \nthrough N-5.    \n35.  The abuses complained of herein occur at the South Compound of the prison, \nbuildings N-1 through N-4, which are solitary confinement and extended lockdown tiers.1  \n36.  For the purposes of the litigation, extended lockdown refers to the confinement in \na cell for 23 to 24 hours per day. Solitary confinement refers to the subset of extended lockdown \nin which a single prisoner is confined alone in a cell with no regular social interaction for 23 to 24 \nhours per day. \n37.  Each lockdown building has four linear tiers: A, B, C, and D. The tiers each have \n16 cells. These cells may used as double-man cells, except in the N-4 building, which is the solitary \nconfinement building.  \n38.  Of the 16 cells on each tier in N-4, the first two cells are reserved for individuals \nwho are on suicide watch. There is a camera in each of those cells, as well as in all cells on the N-\n4 C tier.  \n39.  The buildings are not consistently climate controlled. There is no air conditioning. \nFans were installed approximately a year ago. In the summer the cells are very hot, and in the \nwinter they are cold.  \nB.  Conditions in the David Wade Lockdown Units are Brutal and Inhumane. \n40.  All prisoners who are transferred to DWCC are housed in lockdown for a period of \ntime prior to being moved to general population. The lockdown units also are used for any prisoner \nin general population who is suicidal or attempts suicide. Finally, the units are used for the \n                                                \n1 N-5 is not subject of this litigation as it houses high-profile prisoners in different conditions than the other \nbuildings. \n12 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 316   Filed 03/13/20   Page 13 of 59 PageID #:  5444\ndisciplinary population: prisoners who have committed a rule violation in general population may \nbe administratively sentenced to serve time in the lockdown buildings.  \n41.  On extended lockdown, individuals are allowed outside for fifty-five minutes per \nday Monday through Friday, unless they are on “yard restriction.” If on yard restriction, one is \nallowed outside for fifty-five minutes on Saturdays and Sundays. Many people are on yard \nrestriction for months or years on end.  Mr. Charles has been on yard restriction for nearly two \nyears. \n42.  People on extended lockdown get one ten-minute phone call per month. That phone \ncall is not at a regularly scheduled time and thus there is no way to plan for a family member to be \navailable for the phone call. Staff may refuse a prisoner’s phone call without giving any reason.  \nStaff will often refuse the call as retaliation against the individual requesting the call.  Individuals \non extended lockdown are unable to make attorney phone calls.   \n43.  Extended lockdown prisoners are not brought for a shower every day. Staff barter \nadditional food in exchange for prisoners waiving their shower time, do not wake sleeping \nprisoners for their showers, or simply ignore the prisoner and record the shower as having been \nwaived. \n44.  Prisoners  on extended lockdown are allowed three books. There is no radio, \ntelevision, educational program, self-help program, or any other external stimuli on the tier. \nPrisoners who are not literate or who have become incapable of reading due to mental illness have \nnothing to occupy their minds on extended lockdown.  \n45.  Prisoners cannot see one another as the cells face concrete walls and the outer \nwindows.  \n13 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 316   Filed 03/13/20   Page 14 of 59 PageID #:  5445\n46.  Interactions between prisoners are forbidden by the written policy of DWCC, and \nthey may receive a disciplinary write-up for attempting to communicate with one another. \n47.  Prisoners on extended lockdown, especially those in solitary confinement, are \nallowed very little human contact.   \n48.  Most of the individuals serving disciplinary time on the lockdown units have been \ndiagnosed with one or more mental illnesses. Due to the lack of human contact and uncontrolled \nmental illness, many will scream, laugh, and talk to themselves. Others rock in place or deteriorate \nto more severe manifestations of their conditions, such as smearing blood or feces. Some are \nunable to communicate at all.  \n49.  Prisoners who suffer a major psychiatric episode frequently lose the ability to take \ncare of themselves for the duration of such an episode. When a prisoner in extended lockdown is \nunable to care for himself, he may go weeks or months without a shower.  \n50.  Defendants maintain a policy styled “Offender Posted Policy 34(S),” hereinafter \n“Policy 34,” or “strip cell.” This policy permits staff to strip a prisoner of all belongings, including \nhis mattress, in response to a perceived rule violation.  \n51.  Policy 34 is independent of any formal disciplinary sentence. It is deployed at staff \ndiscretion with no due process protections or hearings. The absence of any procedural safeguards \nmeans that a staff member who becomes upset with a prisoner may simply put the prisoner on \nPolicy 34 without any showing that the prisoner has violated any institutional rules. \n52.  On Policy 34, prisoners are not allowed a mattress outside of the hours of 9pm to \n5am. Although the policy calls for mattresses to be returned at 9pm, they are frequently not \nreturned timely or at all. Prisoners will be housed this way for thirty days or more, at the whim of \nthe ranking correctional officers. This status is strictly punitive.  \n14 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 316   Filed 03/13/20   Page 15 of 59 PageID #:  5446\n53.  If a prisoner on lockdown requests mental health care, he will usually be placed on \nsuicide watch.  \n54.  DWCC has two categories of suicide watch, standard and extreme.   \n55.  Prisoners on standard suicide watch are clothed only in a short paper gown.  The \nprisoner has no access to any property, including mattresses, letters, or books. He can only stand \nor sit in his cell on the concrete in a short paper gown. \n56.  On extreme suicide watch, the suicidal prisoner is housed in a paper gown without \naccess to property, but is additionally placed in restraints while in a cell alone.  Those restraints \nmay be: (1) four-point restraints, which consist of both hands being cuffed with the chain for the \ncuffs connected to a box to prevent movement or tampering, a belly chain connected to the \nhandcuff chain, and shackles on the ankles, (2) chaining a person to a restraint chair, which attaches \neach limb to the chair, or (3) the restraint chair with a helmet to prevent spitting and head banging. \nDWCC staff sometimes restrain prisoners in this chair for days at a time, and often use the chair \nrather than providing actual mental health care. \n57.  DWCC staff engage in targeted punishment of suicidal prisoners. Defendants \nrefuse to allow prisoners on suicide watch to visit with relatives or use the telephone to access any \nsource of outside emotional support. Although the facility possesses suicide resistant mattresses, \nthose mattresses are often not given to prisoners on suicide watch, who must stand and sleep on \nthe concrete. \n58.  In the winter, prisoners’ cells can be extremely cold. Prisoners uniformly report that \nsometimes staff open windows near the suicide watch cells to make conditions even colder. \nBecause they do not have shoes or mattresses people must stand barefoot on concrete in a small \npaper gown.  \n15 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 316   Filed 03/13/20   Page 16 of 59 PageID #:  5447\n59.  Eleven independent prisoners’ accounts confirmed that windows were left open late \nDecember of 2017 and early January of 2018, including January 2, 2018, when temperatures in \nHomer, Louisiana reached a low of 14 degrees Fahrenheit. The use of extreme cold to punish \nbehavior on the tier is not a single isolated incident and occurs so frequently that prisoners have a \nword for it, “bluesing” or “getting bluesed.” \n60.  When a prisoner in extended lockdown decides to self-report a mental health need, \none must prepare to spend days and likely weeks without clothing, on a concrete floor, without a \nmattress, and without access to any property. Individuals are held in these conditions for days or \nweeks at a time, irrespective of the actual risk of harm, whether other treatment methods would be \neffective, and even once the threat of self-harm has subsided.  \n61.  These conditions function as a deterrent to requesting any mental health care at all. \nConfining Plaintiffs to suicide watch as a general response to mental health concerns significantly \nchills willingness to report signs and symptoms of mental illness to staff. \n62.  The extreme isolation, deprivation of stimuli, severe punishments, and acts of \ntorture all work to create a significant risk of harm to the mental health of the people housed at \nDWCC.  \nC.  Defendants Fail to Provide Adequate Mental Health Care and Are Deliberately \nIndifferent to Prisoners’ Mental Health Needs. \n \n63.  Defendants fail to provide any meaningful access to mental health care to the \nprisoners on extended lockdown. First, Defendants fail to identify prisoners with serious mental \nillness and consistently understate the severity of mental illness where it is identified. Second, even \nwhen an individual with mental illness is identified, every prisoner receives the same treatment \nplan that calls for nothing except medication management. Third, when the inadequate treatment \ncauses a prisoner to decompensate, the only means Defendants employ to stabilize a patient is to \n16 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 316   Filed 03/13/20   Page 17 of 59 PageID #:  5448\nsimply place the prisoner on suicide watch. Fourth, Defendants’ failure to adequately staff the \nmental health program at the prison contributes to each of these problems.  \n64.  Each of these failed policies put prisoners at severe risk of mental illness and \nphysical harm. As outlined in Part C of this Complaint, these policies have caused actual harm to \neach named Plaintiff and to others housed at DWCC, including constituents of the Advocacy \nCenter. Defendants act with deliberate indifference to these risks. \na.  Defendants’ Inadequate Mental Health Screening Places Prisoners at Risk of  \n    Serious Harm. \n \n65.  Mental health screening at DWCC is a failure at every juncture, including during \nintake, regular screening, and in response to crisis and suicide watch. Where screenings do occur, \nthe inadequacy of the process results in under-diagnoses of serious mental illness. \n66.  Defendants’  failure  to  identify  prisoners  with  serious  mental  illness  exposes \nprisoners to significant risks of mental and physical harm and deprives prisoners of the opportunity \nto receive needed treatment. \n \n  i.  Defendants Place Prisoners on Extended Lockdown Without Adequate \n      Screening.  \n \n67.  Proper mental health screening is critical to the safety of prisoners.  \n68.  Prisoners sentenced to the DPS&C are often initially assessed at Elayn Hunt \nCorrectional Center (“EHCC”) before being assigned to a specific DPS&C facility for housing. \nEHCC has reception and diagnostic capacities, has a psychiatrist on staff, and has a special housing \nunit for individuals with severe mental health needs.  \n69.  If a prisoner is placed by DPS&C at DWCC, David Wade staff then perform a \nmental health screening. Inexplicably, these assessments do not take into account the person’s \n17 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 316   Filed 03/13/20   Page 18 of 59 PageID #:  5449\ninitial DPS&C evaluation or their DPS&C records. These screenings are cursory, unhelpful, and \nproduce results that are plainly contrary to facts already in the DPS&C’s own records. \n70.  The mental health screening is typically performed by Steve Hayden, who is not a \npsychiatrist, psychologist, social worker, or counselor.  \n71.  Prisoners known to the Defendants to have serious mental illnesses, including \nextensive histories of suicidal ideation and behavior, are routinely placed on extended lockdown \nat DWCC.  \n72.  Placement on extended lockdown further exposes a prisoner with serious mental \nillness  to  significant  risk  of  self-harm.  Defendants’  screening  mechanisms  disregard  the \ninformation available in the prisoners’ mental health records. \n73.  Likewise, when a prisoner is placed on extended lockdown for a disciplinary \nreason, Defendants do not conduct any review of records to identify whether the prisoner has a \nmental health diagnosis that would require treatment or care inconsistent with the extreme isolation \nof solitary confinement or extended lockdown. \n  ii.  Defendants Fail to Conduct Regular Screening for Mental Illness    \n      in Extended Lockdown. \n \n74.  The absence of observation and monitoring of individuals on extended lockdown \nmeans that psychiatric decompensation goes unnoticed, as does the onset of new symptoms. \n75.  Staff at DWCC conduct segregation interviews for prisoners in extended lockdown \napproximately every 90 days. These interviews are conducted primarily by Defendant Hayden and \nDefendant Robinson.  \n76.  The  segregation  interviews  that  are  conducted are  cursory  and  diagnostically \nunhelpful.  The documentation produced as a result of a routine segregation interview will nearly \nuniversally indicate that the prisoner is “within normal limits” in all areas, even for prisoners with \n18 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 316   Filed 03/13/20   Page 19 of 59 PageID #:  5450\nserious mental health diagnoses. Interviews also usually indicate that the prisoner engaged in \nminimal conversation. \n77.  Signs and symptoms of serious mental illness remain unidentified or untreated and \nprisoners experiencing crisis manifestations of mental illness are not detected before the person is \na significant risk to himself or others. Each of the named class representatives have been harmed \nby the absence of ongoing screening for mental illness while on extended lockdown because they \nhave not been assessed for changes to their condition despite new and worsening symptoms. \n  iii.  Defendants Do Not Conduct Mental Health Screening in Response  \n      to Mental Health Crisis Situations. \n \n78.  Defendants do not respond to evidence of mental health crisis with any system of \nassessments, diagnostics, counseling, or treatment. \n79.  Defendants do not conduct screenings or make mental health resources available to \nprisoners with a pattern of suicidal ideation, even in the face of repeated mental health crises.  \n80.  Upon release from suicide watch, Defendants’ policy only calls for one follow-up \ninterview, to be conducted one week after the prisoner is taken off suicide watch. The follow-up \ninterview uses the same format as the “Segregation Interview” and does not call for any further \nmental health evaluations or services. \n81.  Other manifestations of illness that fall short of self-harm or suicidal ideation are \ntreated as disciplinary violations and produce no mental health treatment or follow-up. Defendants \nrespond  to  yelling,  cursing, refusing  to  move, and  other  behavior  potentially  diagnostic  of \nuntreated mental illness as a disciplinary matter rather than a mental health symptom. \n82.  The failure of DWCC’s system of intake, diagnosis, and routine evaluation exposes \nall prisoners to the real risk that a mental illness will be left undiagnosed and untreated.  \n19 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 316   Filed 03/13/20   Page 20 of 59 PageID #:  5451\nb.  Defendants Provide Inadequate Mental Health Treatment to Prisoners on  \n    Extended Lockdown. \n \n83.  Prisoners on extended lockdown receive virtually no treatment for mental illness. \nThere is no counseling, group therapy, or support group, regardless of an individual’s diagnosis or \nresponse to medication. \n84.  Prisoners on lockdown in DWCC only have contact with a contracting psychiatrist, \nDefendant Seal, every three months.  These visits last approximately 3-5 minutes.  A security \nofficer is present in the room at every visit, and thus, if the patient wants to seek mental health care \nrelated to treatment by security staff, there is no confidentiality or privacy.  These visits lack indicia \nof either diagnostic or psychotherapeutic purpose due to their short duration, infrequency, and lack \nof confidentiality. Defendant Seal’s signature does not appear on any treatment plans. Defendant \nSeal never prescribes counseling, group therapy, or any intervention whatsoever other than \nmedication. \n85.  Defendant Seal is retained by DWCC to provide these medication management \nvisits to prisoners.  Defendant Seal provides no other mental health services to prisoners in solitary \nor lockdown. \n86.  In the event that a prisoner does not receive a prescription for any medication from \nDefendant Seal, that individual receives no mental health treatment plan whatsoever.  \n87.  Treatment for many mental health conditions requires more than just medication. \nThe chemical elements of treatment cannot replace therapy and counseling services to assist \npatients in coping with their mental illnesses. \n88.  All treatment plans for prisoners in solitary or extended lockdown at DWCC are \nsubstantively identical. \n20 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 316   Filed 03/13/20   Page 21 of 59 PageID #:  5452\n89.  This generalized treatment plan that Defendants use to treat all Plaintiffs has no \nvalue. The treatment plan is the same regardless of diagnosis, treatment history, medication \nregimen, and all other individual circumstances.  \n90.  The long-term treatment goals in the treatment plans for everyone on extended \nlockdown are: “Long term treatment goals: 1. Maintain compliance with all institutional rules and \nregulations. 2. Maintain appropriate level of functioning. 3. Increase insight in order to be moved \nto a less restrictive environment. Date Met: on-going.” \n91.  The  short-term  objectives  in  the  treatment  plans  for  everyone  on  extended \nlockdown are: “Short Term Objectives: Comply with medications prescribed and advise staff of \nany adverse effects, Identify stressors that create behaviors warranting segregation, Consistently \ndisplay appropriate behavior in accordance to institutional regulations.” \n92.  The treatment methods in the treatment plans for everyone on extended lockdown \nare absent. Each form cryptically states: “Treatment Methods: on-going.”  \n93.  The plans are also completely devoid of any required actions on the part of DWCC \nto provide any monitoring, counseling, or therapy, regardless of any patient’s medical history, \ndiagnosis, or circumstances.  \n94.  The  Defendants’  treatment  plan  template  indicates  that  a  mechanism  for \nachievement should be coded beside each short-term goal, identifying how Defendants will help \nthe individual to achieve each identified goal. No treatment method codes are ever displayed and \nthere is never any narrative explanation of a treatment method. \n95.  Defendant Steve Hayden signed all mental health treatment plans for the named \nPlaintiffs identifying himself as a “therapist.” Mr. Hayden is in fact not licensed by the State of \nLouisiana to provide mental health care in any capacity.  \n21 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 316   Filed 03/13/20   Page 22 of 59 PageID #:  5453\n96.  The mental health treatment forms are also signed as “Reviewed by Michele \nDauzat, Assist. Warden, LCSW.” Assistant Warden Dauzat did not have any contact with the \nPlaintiffs in the formulation of their treatment plans. She almost never interacts with patients on \nthe lockdown units at DWCC, yet she approves their treatment plans. These plans are non-\nindividualized  and  do  not  reflect  any  individual  assessment  by  a  qualified  psychological \nprofessional.  \n97.  Plaintiff Carlton Turner received a mental health treatment plan as described above \non November 9, 2017. \n98.  Plaintiff Bruce Charles received a mental health treatment plan exactly as described \nabove on June 9, 2016. \n99.  Mental health care at DWCC consists exclusively of haphazard medication and \nrelegation to restrictive conditions of confinement. When a prisoner has a crisis manifestation of a \nmental illness there are no interventions available other than suicide watch. The cursory treatment \nplans reflect the complete absence of any other interventions.  \nc.  Defendants Deprive Prisoners of Needed Medications. \n100.  Upon transfer to DWCC, Defendants do not continue the medications that were \nbeing prescribed and administered in the facilities where the prisoners were confined immediately \nprior to the transfer.  As a result, a prisoner often waits weeks without necessary medication, until \nhe meets with Defendant Seal, receives a new prescription, and is integrated into the medication \ndistribution rotation. \n101.  Interruptions to mental health medications can trigger behavioral problems or cause \nadditional symptoms in the patient’s underlying mental health condition. \n22 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 316   Filed 03/13/20   Page 23 of 59 PageID #:  5454\n102.  Individuals who refuse medications are diagnosed as “in remission” despite a lack \nof review by a psychiatrist to determine whether the change in medication is appropriate.  \n103.  The record-keeping practices at DWCC are unreliable and dangerous.  Diagnoses \nshift without explanation.  Defendants discontinue or alter drug regimens with little paper trail.   \n104.  Defendant Seal’s clinical notes often indicate that a prisoner has stopped taking the \nprescribed medication of their own accord. However, Defendant Seal’s clinical notes are often \ninconsistent with the medication distribution notes, which do not contain documentation of refused \nmedication. \n105.  When prisoners do refuse psychotropic medications, such refusal is rarely properly \ndocumented. Refusal does not prompt any notification to a psychiatrist or actual medical staff, \ndespite  possible  mental  and  physical  side  effects  of  suddenly  discontinuing  psychotropic \nmedications.  \n106.  This  failure  to  document  is  despite  the  fact  that  “comply  with  medications \nprescribed” is a goal on all generic treatment plans for prisoners in extended lockdown. \n107.  Mental health staff at DWCC frequently make decisions that are inconsistent with \nindividual health concerns that are clearly apparent in their own records. For example, there is no \nprocess  for  identifying  which  prisoners  are  on  medication  regimens  that  cannot  safely  be \nterminated without a step-down process. \nd.    Defendants Utilize Suicide Watch and Isolation as Substitutes for    \n    Necessary Mental Health Treatment  \n \n108.  There is no mental health treatment unit at David Wade Correctional Center.  \n109.  Due to the lack of general mental health screening and treatment by qualified staff, \nDefendants use isolation and suicide watch as a response to any urgent request for mental health \nservices, even if the request does not express suicidal ideation or threats of self-harm.   \n23 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 316   Filed 03/13/20   Page 24 of 59 PageID #:  5455\n110.  Defendants’ notes from cell-front visits indicate that staff visits to people being \nheld on suicide watch are purely to determine whether the individual remains a threat to himself.  \nThe conversations are short and do not include any attempt to ascertain whether the individual is \nsuffering from worsening mental illness or is experiencing a crisis manifestation of a chronic \nmental illness.  \n111.  The underlying mental illness causing the self-harm risk is not addressed, due to \nthe complete lack of other mental health treatment and screening.  This often results in prisoners \nreturning to suicide watch multiple times.   \n112.  The harsh conditions of suicide watch and lack of treatment trigger psychiatric \ndeterioration and decompensation of prisoners.  People become trapped in a cycle of suicidal \nthoughts and self-harm, deterioration in the harsh conditions of suicide watch, and new behavioral \nincidents caused by untreated mental illness. This results in additional disciplinary and self-harm \nactions. This cycle goes on ad infinitum. It prevents people from ever regaining their mental \nstability or leaving the disciplinary unit at the prison.  \n113.  Once they request urgent or crisis mental health care, prisoners are usually forced \nonto suicide watch as the only available intervention. If the prisoner refuses suicide watch and \nrequests other care, he may face a disciplinary charge of malingering.  The result is that many \npeople will remain quiet and silently suffer as mental health symptoms worsen to avoid choosing \nbetween the harsh conditions on suicide watch or a disciplinary charge.  \n114.  The Advocacy Center’s constituents and the putative Class members all face a risk \nof being subjected to the Defendants’ punitive, non-therapeutic policies and practices pertaining \nto suicide watch.  Given the prevalence of under-diagnosed and untreated serious mental illness at \nDWCC, every prisoner housed on the South Compound is at significant risk of being trapped in \n24 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 316   Filed 03/13/20   Page 25 of 59 PageID #:  5456\nan ever-deepening cycle of untreated mental illness, crisis manifestations of the chronic mental \nillness, escalating crises, and housing on suicide watch. \ne.  Defendants Maintain Inadequate Mental Health Staffing  \n115.  Mental health services at DWCC are abysmally inadequate. There is one contract \npsychiatrist, Defendant Seal.  He only sees patients every ninety days—in the presence of security \nstaff-- for medication management. Prisoners are unable to otherwise request visits with him.  \n116.  Unlicensed DWCC staff make mental health treatment and housing decisions based \nupon cursory, uninformed, or limited interaction with prisoners.  \n117.  Defendant Steve Hayden is unqualified and unlicensed to provide mental health \ncare yet he makes most day-to-day decisions about care.  When he does walk-through the extended \nlockdown facilities, he does not provide any counseling services.  \n118.  Assistant Warden Michelle Dauzat is responsible for the mental health program at \nDWCC.  Warden Dauzat does not regularly meet with prisoners in extended lockdown.  However, \nshe signs off on paperwork for individuals on extended lockdown without having ever seen her \nputative patients. \nD.  Defendants’ Lack of Mental Health Care Results in Serious Harm. \n \n119.  The  failure  to  provide  mental  health  care  has  substantially  injured  people \nincarcerated at DWCC. They have unnecessarily suffered from the treatable symptoms of mental \nillness, the exacerbation of symptoms of mental illness, increased instances of discipline and non-\nconforming behavior, the development of new mental illnesses, the increased need for treatment, \nand the diminished chance of successfully treating the mental illness in the future. The abysmal \ncare causes serious and potentially irreversible harm to many of the men housed at DWCC.  \n25 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 316   Filed 03/13/20   Page 26 of 59 PageID #:  5457\n120.  All prisoners on extended lockdown are subjected to the risk that a mental illness \nwill develop and that Defendants will leave it untreated. \n121.  It is well established that solitary confinement and extended cell confinement can \nhave devastating effects on the mental well-being of a person.  The conditions of solitary \nconfinement and extended lockdown at DWCC are not merely abusive or psychologically painful, \nthey cause the onset or major deterioration of Plaintiffs’ mental illnesses. \n  a.  Defendants’ Policies and Practices Harmed and Continue to Harm the Named  \n    Plaintiffs. \n \n122.  The Defendants’ policies and practices for screening, treatment, and medication of \nmental illnesses on extended lockdown have harmed, and continue to harm, Bruce Charles, Carlton \nTurner, Larry Jones, and Ronald Brooks, the named Plaintiffs to this case. \n123.  These same policies and practices inflict the same harm on other members of the \nputative class and sub-class, as well as the constituents of the Advocacy Center. \n  i.   Plaintiff Bruce Charles \n124.  Plaintiff Bruce Charles was processed into DPS&C custody on February 20, 2013.  \n125.  On June 2, 2016, he arrived in extended lockdown at DWCC on transfer from Allen \nCorrectional Center. \n126.  On June 6, 2016, Mr. Charles received cursory and contradictory intake and review \nscreenings.  \n127.  First, on June 6, 2016, Defendant Hayden completed a “Mental Health Intake \nScreening” for Mr. Charles. Hayden marked that his mood, affect, and thought process were within \nnormal  limits.  He  noted  that  Mr.  Charles  denied  any  current  symptoms,  suicidal  ideation, \ntreatment, or psychotropic medications. He wrote that “prior treatment” was “none.”  \n26 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 316   Filed 03/13/20   Page 27 of 59 PageID #:  5458\n128.  The DOC records for Mr. Charles prior to this date show, conversely, that Mr. \nCharles reported a diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder dating back to 2001, has been prescribed \npsychotropic medications since the age of 12, was prescribed Depakote while incarcerated, had \ntreatment plans citing mood instability and depressed mood, and had been placed on mental health \nobservation several times.  \n129.  Also, on June 6, 2016, Defendant Hayden completed a “Level of Care Review” for \nMr. Charles. Under “Axis I diagnosis” he circled “none indicated.” Under “Diagnosis” in the \n“Severe Mental Illness” section, he checked “Bipolar Disorder” and entered a diagnosis date of \nDecember 10, 2013. He assigned Mr. Charles to LOC 5h. LOC 5 indicates no current mental \nillness, and the modifier “h” indicates a history of mental illness.  \n130.  On June 9, 2016, Mr. Charles saw Defendant Seal for the first time in psychiatric \nclinic.  Defendant  Seal  noted  that  Mr.  Charles  was  not  currently  receiving  medication,  but \npreviously received Valproic acid, Seroquel, Zyprexa, and Risperdal. Mr. Charles reported that he \nwas struggling with sleep. Seal noted Mr. Charles’ mood to be fair, and his affect to be flattened. \nSeal diagnosed Mr. Charles as having Bipolar I and prescribed Depakote, with the medication level \nto be checked in two weeks.  \n131.  The clinic assessment form documents that Mr. Charles would be scheduled for his \nnext psychiatric clinic in 4-6 months.  \n132.  On the same day, June 9, 2016, another Level of Care Review form was filled out, \nreassigning Mr. Charles from LOC 5 to LOC 3. Under Defendants’ policies, Mr. Charles would \nnot anticipate another encounter with mental health staff for the next 30 days at least, despite the \nfact that he was starting a potent psychotropic medication.  \n27 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 316   Filed 03/13/20   Page 28 of 59 PageID #:  5459\n133.   On June 12, 2016, within three days of the Level of Care Review, Mr. Charles was \nplaced on extreme suicide watch after he tied a sheet around his neck in an attempt to hang himself. \n134.  Defendant  Assistant  Warden  Dauzat  documented  the  attempted  hanging  in  a \n“Progress Note” but did not enter information for any of the 17 indicators of mental status. Mr. \nCharles was placed on extreme suicide watch following the attempt, and was downgraded to \nstandard suicide watch the next day.  \n135.  On June 14, 2016, Steve Hayden completed a “Progress Note” while visiting Mr. \nCharles on suicide watch. Hayden marked that his affect and mood were angry, his thought content \nwas suicidal, his judgment was poor, his attitude was demanding, his behavior was aggressive, and \nhe had suicidal ideations. Hayden noted that Mr. Charles had a plan to harm himself and begin a \nhunger strike.  \n136.  On the same day, June 14, 2016, Defendant Adkins also completed a “Progress \nNote” while visiting Mr. Charles. Adkins marked that his mood was normal, his affect was mood \ncongruent, his thought content was normal, his thought process was logical, his judgment was \nnormal, his attitude was cooperative, his behavior was normal, and he showed no significant risk \nof suicide. Defendant Adkins noted that Mr. Charles appeared in good spirits, and did not complain \nor try to persuade.  \n137.  On June 14, 2016, two days after Defendant Dauzat wrote a note documenting Mr. \nCharles’ suicide attempt, Defendant Dauzat signed his intake screening. This intake screening \nshowed his level of care as 5h, no Axis I diagnosis, no suicidal ideation, no symptoms, no history \nof treatment, and no current treatment. Her signature follows the statements “The initial screening \ndata have been reviewed, and needs for additional screening or assessment/consultation, if any, \nare documented in Section C”, and “Plan: Follow up per policy”. There are no additional notes \n28 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 316   Filed 03/13/20   Page 29 of 59 PageID #:  5460\nfollowing this statement of review. Mr. Charles was still on suicide watch when that document \nwas signed. \n138.  On June 17, 2016, Defendant Hayden completed notes stating that Mr. Charles still \nhad suicidal ideations and threatened self-harm. On June 17, 2016, Defendant Adkins completed \na note stating that Mr. Charles had clear thinking and felt better, and that “other than the heat, all \nwas well”.  \n139.  There is no documentation that Mr. Charles had any encounters with mental health \nstaff on June 18 or June 19, while he remained on suicide watch.  \n140.  On June 20, 2016, Defendant Hayden noted that Mr. Charles had no suicidal \nideations or plans to self-harm, and released him from suicide watch. None of the documents \ncreated during this period record any diagnostic batteries, inventories, assessments, or instances of \nstaff talking with Mr. Charles about psychosocial factors, support systems, his adjustment to \nmedication, his adjustment to a new environment, coping mechanisms, recognizing risk factors, or \ntreatment options.  \n141.  Two weeks later, on July 4, 2016, Mr. Charles again reported suicidal ideations and \nwas again placed on suicide watch. There is no documentation that Mr. Charles was seen on July \n5. On July 6, 2016, Mr. Charles tied a sheet around his neck to attempt suicide. He was again \nplaced on suicide watch, and remained on watch until July 11, 2016. He received a segregation \ninterview on July 28. He was not seen again by mental health until October 10. \n142.  This tangle of self-contradictory progress notes, bungled intake process, and suicide \nwatch is the clearly foreseeable result of Defendants’ policies and lack of planning and available \nmental health resources.  \n29 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 316   Filed 03/13/20   Page 30 of 59 PageID #:  5461\n143.  This pattern has continued since Mr. Charles arrived in extended cell confinement \nat DWCC with diagnosis of bipolar disorder.  He has since been on suicide watch five times, \nstripped belongings and mattress, clothed only in a short paper gown. He is not directly observed \nduring this time period. Twice, Mr. Charles has been placed on “extreme suicide watch” for \nattempted suicide, meaning he was chained and clothed only in a paper gown in his cell without \naccess to any stimuli or people.  The duration of Mr. Charles’ confinement in extended lockdown \nhas caused his health to deteriorate such that he consistently presents a danger to himself. \n144.  Mr. Charles is currently categorized as LOC 3 by the DPS&C. \n145.  The DPS&C defines LOC 3 as follows: “LOC 3 shall be assigned to offenders with \nSMI (“serious mental illness”) and who have been in remission or have been stable for at least six \nmonths. These offenders may live in the general housing areas. A SMI diagnosis is typically \nchronic in nature and the offender will most likely remain diagnosed with SMI for the remainder \nof the offender's life. If they are stable, functional and have no major problem with compliance \nthen they should be designated as LOC 3.” \n146.  Mr. Charles’ condition routinely manifests as self-injurious or suicidal thoughts and \nactions. Because of the lack of screening and treatment, he is simply maintained on extended \nlockdown or suicide watch until the crisis manifestations of the chronic mental illness passes and \nhe temporarily recompensates.   \n147.  Mr. Charles’ diagnoses and behaviors are mismatched with his classification as \nLOC 3. His chronic mental illness has manifested repeatedly as suicidal behavior.  \n148.  Mr. Charles started Depakote, a trade name for valproic acid, in June of 2016. In \nMarch of 2017, Defendant Seal noted that he was “still only sporadically compliant”, determined \nby VPA levels in his system. Charles has no medication refusal forms in his record from this time, \n30 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 316   Filed 03/13/20   Page 31 of 59 PageID #:  5462\nand was never written up for having excess medication during shakedowns. If the Depakote was \nnot refused, not in his system, and not in his cell, it stands to reason that the medication was not \ncorrectly dosed or delivered. There is no attempt by the Defendants to reconcile this serious \nmedication discrepancy.  \n149.  Mr. Charles reported suicidal ideations on April 12, 2017.  He was seen by the nurse \non duty and told that because no mental health staff were available at the time, he would be \ntransferred to suicide watch. Mr. Charles did not want to move to suicide watch due to the harsh \nconditions. Staff informed him that if he refused suicide watch, he would receive a prison \ndisciplinary charge of malingering. Mr. Charles chose to accept a malingering charge and received \na disciplinary action rather than being transferred indefinitely to suicide watch.  \n150.  On May 26, 2017, Mr. Charles again became suicidal due to deaths in his family.  \nHe was transferred to suicide watch. The prison stripped him of his clothes, gave him a paper gown \nand took away all of his possessions.  He received no mental health services to help him to cope \nwith his loss or deal with the symptoms of his mental illness during that difficult time. \n151.  In June of 2017, Mr. Charles learned that another of his brothers had just died. In \nprotest against the absence of mental health services available to help him cope with his recent \nlosses, Mr. Charles went on hunger strike on July 7, 2017. Defendants placed Mr. Charles on \nsuicide watch due to his hunger strike. His family tried to visit him during this time and was denied.   \n152.  Mr. Charles’ existing mental illness was greatly exacerbated due to Defendants’ \nuse of extreme isolation from family support and the absence of mental health staff to help deal \nwith his loss. \n31 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 316   Filed 03/13/20   Page 32 of 59 PageID #:  5463\n153.  Mr. Charles has frequently been placed on suicide watch since his arrival at DWCC. \nNo  additional  mental  health  diagnostics  or  screenings  have  been  given  to  him  despite  his \nreoccurring suicidal ideations. \n154.  This series of events clearly illustrates several of Defendants’ problematic policies \nand practices: (1) repeated use of suicide watch does not trigger any alarm bells that a prisoner’s \nmental health condition is not being effectively treated, (2) prisoners so dangerously unstable that \nthey require suicide watch are still considered to be sufficiently “in remission or stable” for the \npurposes of level of care classification, (3) prisoners with known serious and chronic mental \nillnesses are placed in extended lockdown, (4) even as evidence of a serious mental illness mounts, \nthere is no process for reconsidering whether extended lockdown is an appropriate setting for \ntreatment, and (5) Defendants apply the same schedule for mental health visits to all prisoners \nregardless of individual needs. \n  ii.  Plaintiff Carlton Turner \n155.  Plaintiff Carlton Turner was processed into DPS&C custody in September 1996. \n156.  Mr. Turner’s diagnosis was listed as Major Depressive Disorder at the time of his \narrival at DWCC despite receiving a diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder in early 2007 while at \nLouisiana State Penitentiary. \n157.  Mr. Turner has an extensive history of self-harm and suicide attempts documented \nwithin his DOC records. \n158.  On May 2, 2011 he arrived in extended lockdown at DWCC on transfer from \nLouisiana State Penitentiary.  \n32 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 316   Filed 03/13/20   Page 33 of 59 PageID #:  5464\n159.  Mr. Turner was classified as level of care 2 at the time he was transferred to DWCC. \nHis  last  psychiatric  evaluation  before  transfer  indicated  diagnoses  of  intermittent  explosive \ndisorder, major depressive disorder, borderline personality disorder, and paraphilia. \n160.  On May 5, 2011, Mr. Turner received his first visit with Dr. Seal.  He received a \ndiagnosis of major depressive disorder.   \n161.  On July 5, 2011, Mr. Turner’s level of care was reviewed and he remained \ncategorized as a level of care 2.    \n162.  Mr. Turner remained on extended lockdown until 2012 when he was moved into \ngeneral population. \n163.  In January and June of 2016, Defendant Seal had diagnosed Mr. Turner with only \nMajor Depression, although he was prescribed both an antipsychotic and an antidepressant. On \nAugust 12, 2016, around 8:30AM, staff found Mr. Turner sitting on the floor bleeding due to \nhaving cut his own scrotum. He was treated in the infirmary, and visited by Defendant Assistant \nWarden Dauzat, who noted that he refused to converse. He was ordered into the restraint chair on \nExtreme Suicide Watch.  \n164.  After 10 hours, Mr. Turner was downgraded to alternative restraints by verbal \norder, after nursing reported that he was calm and not attempting to remove stitches. He remained \nin a camera cell, with continued orders to be checked every 15 minutes and at random. Lieutenant \nGary Carter recorded on a suicide watch log that he checked on Mr. Turner at 10:10AM, and Mr. \nTurner was laying on his bunk. Lt. Carter completed an unusual incident report stating that, at \n10:25AM, he was passing out cups and sporks for mealtime, when he observed Mr. Turner, who \nwas bleeding from his right wrist with a puddle of blood on the floor.  \n33 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 316   Filed 03/13/20   Page 34 of 59 PageID #:  5465\n165.  Defendant Dauzat again verbally ordered Turner into the restraint chair. Mr. Turner \nwas again downgraded to alternative restraints after 10 hours in the restraint chair, because he had \nconversed with nursing staff and hadn’t expressed a current intent to harm himself. The following \nmorning,  Mr.  Turner  remained  on  Extreme  Suicide  Watch  with  15-minute  observations. \nLieutenant Gary Carter logged that he checked on Turner at 6:21AM, and Mr. Turner was sleeping.  \n166.  Lt. Carter completed another Unusual Occurrence Report documenting that, four \nminutes later, at 6:25AM, Carter had been passing out cups and sporks when he observed Mr. \nTurner with arms outstretched and blood dripping from his left wrist. Medical was called after Mr. \nTurner was escorted to the lobby in full restraints, and he was treated. Defendant Dauzat was then \ncalled, and for a third time she verbally ordered Mr. Turner, now with wounds on both wrists and \nhis genitals, to be strapped to a chair.  \n167.  At evening shift change 12 hours later, Defendant Dauzat documented that, with \nverbal concurrence by a staff physician, Dr. Fuller, due to his self-harm and lack of communication \nwith staff, he would be left in the restraint chair, while mental health staff went home for the night. \nThe following morning, while Mr. Turner was allowed a break from the chair and lay in his cell \nin other restraints, he repeatedly hit his head against the bunk, causing a bloody wound. He refused \nto converse when visited by Defendant Hayden. This was the first-time mental health staff \nattempted to see or speak with him in three days, after he had spent over 40 hours with his limbs \nstrapped to a chair and intentionally injured himself four times.  \n168.  Mr. Turner was placed in a helmet and returned to the restraint chair. Hayden again \nvisited at 11:15AM, but Mr. Turner still refused conversation. Hayden observed “no outward \naggression or attempts at self-injury”, although Mr. Turner was fully immobilized. He was again \ndowngraded to alternative restraints.  \n34 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 316   Filed 03/13/20   Page 35 of 59 PageID #:  5466\n169.  Hayden visited again later, and alleged that Mr. Turner then reported that his self-\nharm was due to believing that he had been given a write-up, but had discovered that he had not \nreceived a write-up, and didn’t plan to harm himself. He was downgraded to Standard Suicide \nWatch.  \n170.  Mr.  Turner’s  escalating  suicide  attempts  did  not  prompt  any  mental  health \ntreatment, counseling, or assessment. None of these events triggered any actual diagnostics. \nSatisfied with the explanation that Mr. Turner was upset over a write-up, Defendants ignored the \nobvious evidence that underlying mental illness caused Mr. Turner to mutilate his genitals and cut \nhis wrists. \n171.  Shortly after being taken off of suicide watch, Mr. Turner was returned to general \npopulation. \n172.  On November 17, 2016, Mr. Turner was sent back to extended lockdown due to \ntwo write-up he received from Defendant Robinson. Those write-ups are based on a journal entry \nMr. Turner wrote for the anger management program at the direction of Defendant Robinson.  He \nhas been classified as housed on extended lockdown since, notwithstanding hospital visits and \ninfirmary stays caused by suicide attempts.   \n173.  On August 29, 2017, Mr. Turner is placed on extreme suicide watch in alternative \nrestraints.   \n174.  On September 4, 2017, Defendant Hayden completed a Mental Health Progress \nNote for level of care and suicide watch follow up in which he stated Mr. Turner denied any current \nmental health concerns.  \n35 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 316   Filed 03/13/20   Page 36 of 59 PageID #:  5467\n175.  Two weeks later, on September 18, 2017, Mr. Turner climbed to the top of the 12-\nfoot fence that surrounded the area for yard time and jumped off. His stated intention was to \ncommit suicide. The fall did not result in his death but did cause serious trauma to both of his legs. \n176.  His plan to commit suicide was due to insufficient mental health treatment, an \ninability to be transferred to a facility with adequate mental health treatment, and retaliation for \nspeaking with attorneys. He received a disciplinary write-up for “general disobedience” as a result \nof the suicide attempt. \n177.  Following his suicide attempt, he was taken by ambulance to LSU Shreveport. \nWhile there, the psychiatric sections of his plan of care, for a span of only three weeks, included 7 \ngoals and 27 modes of intervention. He was seen daily by a licensed psychiatrist and his medication \nwas  constantly  monitored.  The  staff  at  LSU  diagnosed  Mr.  Turner  with  bipolar  disorder, \ndepression, and anxiety on admission.  \n178.  Upon Mr. Turner’s discharge on October 5, 2017, the only change to his mental \nhealth care that followed him back to DWCC was a change in his medication to lithium. \n179.  Mr. Turner has now been returned to extended lockdown. He required multiple \nsurgeries and faced the possibility of amputation of his leg due to injuries. The danger of losing \nthe leg has passed, but he has sustained likely permanent functional damage.  \n180.  Despite reports to DWCC staff and hospital staff at LSU that it was a suicide \nattempt, as well as a suicide note he had tucked into his shoe before jumping, Mr. Turner received \na write up for general disobedience. \n181.  On November 9, 2017, Mr. Turner has his first visit with Defendant Seal following \nthe suicide attempt. Defendant Seal’s progress note indicates that Mr. Turner was hospitalized at \n36 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 316   Filed 03/13/20   Page 37 of 59 PageID #:  5468\nLSU following an escape attempt. Defendant Seal changed Mr. Turner’s diagnosis to bipolar from \nmajor depressive disorder. \n182.  After he was returned to DWCC from his stay in the hospital, he was housed in the \ninfirmary until he was returned to extended lockdown. \n183.  There are no records documenting any investigation or incident review following \nMr. Turner’s suicide attempt. \niii.  Plaintiff Larry Jones \n184.  Larry Jones arrived at DWCC on November 29, 2017 and was assigned to extended \nlockdown on arrival. \n185.  On May 14, 2018, at about 5:12pm, Mr. Jones was on suicide watch. Mr. Jones was \nallowed no possessions beyond a paper gown. He has the tattered gown wrapped around his waist \nat the time of the incident.   \n186.  Mr. Jones was unarmed. Mr. Jones was sitting in the back of his cell on his \ncombination toilet-sink. \n187.  Mr. Jones stated to staff that his problem was Defendant Hayden put him on suicide \nwatch but would not take him off. He did not want to continue sleeping on bare concrete because \nof injuries to his back and neck. Mr. Jones stated that Defendant Hayden ignored his request for a \nsuicide mattress.  \n188.  Mr. Jones stated that Defendant Hayden ignored him when he stated that he no \nlonger had suicidal ideation and that Mr. Hayden treated his mental illness like a joke.  \n189.  Mr. Jones stated Defendant Hayden put him on suicide watch rather than treating \nhis mental health issues. Mr. Jones stated his records indicated he had mental health issues that \n37 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 316   Filed 03/13/20   Page 38 of 59 PageID #:  5469\nDefendants were intentionally ignoring. Mr. Jones stated he believed the staff were keeping him \non suicide watch as a punishment. Mr. Jones claimed the mental health staff were threatening him. \n190.  Mr. Jones stated repeatedly he believed he would be sprayed for asking for help. \nMr. Jones said he was having a “bipolar episode” and that he was in fear for his life because he \nfelt threatened and ignored by Defendant Hayden. \n191.  He states “I don’t know what to do.  I feel hopeless.  I’m [going to] hit my head \nagainst the wall and kick my feet on the bars.”   \n192.  Officers ordered Mr. Jones to quiet down. Mr. Jones began to repeat “I don’t know \nwhat else to do.” Mr. Jones was visibly in distress. Correctional officers then broke off discussion \nand sprayed Mr. Jones with chemical spray. \n193.  Mr. Jones coughed and retched until he was brought out of his cell six minutes after \nexposure to the chemical spray.  \n194.  After exposure to the chemical spray, Mr. Jones was led out of his cell and into the \nlobby. Mr. Jones exhibited difficulty walking. Mr. Jones was then made to kneel and face a closed \ndoor. Mr. Jones was then told to get down. Mr. Jones continued coughing and shaking. \n195.  The video then ends. Mr. Jones received no medical attention through the course of \nthe video. Mr. Jones received no decontamination for at least eight minutes. As Mr. Jones was not \nallowed clothing, his skin was covered in a mixture of sweat and chemical spray.  \n196.  Mr. Jones was eventually “decontaminated” by pouring water on his head, which \ncaused the chemical spray to spread over his skin and, due to his lack of clothing, burn his genitals. \n197.  Mr. Jones received a write-up indicating that he stated he was going to start a riot \nand that his level of noise was making it difficult to monitor the tiers.  His write-up was for \nviolation of Rule #29: “No offender shall create or participate in a disturbance. No offender shall \n38 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 316   Filed 03/13/20   Page 39 of 59 PageID #:  5470\nincite any other person to create or participate in a disturbance.  A disturbance is defined as two or \nmore offenders involving acts of force or violence toward persons or property or acts of resistance \nto the lawful authority of Correctional Officers and/or other law enforcement officers under \ncircumstances which present a threat of injury to persons, to property, or to the security and good \norder of the institution.” \n198.  At no point in the video recording does Mr. Jones make any statements that \nencourage or incite any other people on the tier to engage in any of the conduct that defines a \ndisturbance. \n199.  In the N4 building that afternoon, at least six people, including Mr. Jones, from \nthree different tiers were sprayed following this incident. \niv.   Plaintiff Ronald Brooks  \n200.  Mr. Brooks has a history of mental illness dating back to when he was thirteen years \nold.  He arrived at LSP on December 22, 1997. \n201.  On June 7, 2004, Mr. Brooks was placed on standard suicide watch and his level of \ncare was changed from 5 to 2.  Following completion of his social history and meeting with a \npsychiatrist, he was diagnosed with impulse control disorder and prescribed Depakote. \n202.  Mr. Brooks remained at level of care 2 for years, with diagnoses of post-traumatic \nstress disorder and depressive episodes with psychotic features. During the course of his treatment, \nhe was prescribed Celexa, Depakote, Trazadone, Seroquel, and Wellbutrin.  \n203.  Mr. Brooks’ mental illnesses were categorized as “in remission” in 2011. \n204.  On June 22, 2018, Mr. Brooks was transferred to DWCC following a disciplinary \ncharge related to possession of a cell phone at LSP. \n39 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 316   Filed 03/13/20   Page 40 of 59 PageID #:  5471\n205.  On July 23, 2018, Mr. Brooks received a mental health status exam from Defendant \nHayden.  ”Offender reports adjustment issues regarding his segregated status. He denies any S/I, \nH/I or other MH concerns. Follow up per policy.”  No further action based on his concerns about \nadjustment is reflected in his records. \n206.  On September 19, 2018, Mr. Brooks received a segregation interview from Steve \nHayden.  It indicated everything as within normal limits and stated that Mr. Brooks denied any \nmental health concerns. \n207.  On December 19, 2018, the classification board at DWCC moved Mr. Brooks to \nN-1, pending his return to general population. He returned to the general compound approximately \n11 weeks later. \n208.  On March 13, 2019, Mr. Brooks was returned to extended lockdown. \n209.  There is no indication in Mr. Brooks’ mental health records that he received an \ninitial level of care determination or mental health intake assessment at DWCC. Mr. Brooks also \nhas requested mental health care, but Defendants have not responded to this request.  \n \n  b.  Defendants’ Policies and Practices Harmed and Continue to Harm the Class  \n    Members. \n \n210.  The named Plaintiffs seek to represent the hundreds of men at risk of serious harm \nthrough Defendants’ policies. As illustrated by the following examples, the experiences of the men \nat DWCC, all constituents of the Advocacy Center, sadly follow the common experiences of the \nclass representative above, and those systemic failures alleged in this Complaint.  \n  i.   Matthew Carroll  \n211.  Matthew Carroll has a history of mental health diagnoses and medication reaching \nback to age eight. While at Elayn Hunt Correctional Center, Mr. Carroll attempted suicide by \n40 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 316   Filed 03/13/20   Page 41 of 59 PageID #:  5472\nswallowing a razor blade. On August 17, 2015, Mr. Carroll was transferred from EHCC to DWCC. \nDespite the record of those facts available to Defendants upon his arrival at DWCC, he received \nno mental health medication for one month following his transfer to DWCC. \n212.  Mr. Carroll received a diagnosis of Depression NOS (“Not Otherwise Specified”) \nupon his arrival at DWCC despite having received a diagnosis of intermittent explosive disorder \nand antisocial personality disorder on July 23, 2015 at EHCC.  Additionally, there are a number \nof notes documented while he was at EHCC that indicate psychotic features to his mental illness \nthat are not indicated in the documentation while he has been at DWCC.  \n213.  Mr. Carroll has a documented history of suicidal ideation and attempts since his \nincarceration, even prior to arriving at DWCC.  Upon his arrival at DWCC, he was placed on \nextended lockdown and has not left.  Mr. Carroll continues to go through cycles of suicidal ideation \nand attempts while on extended lockdown resulting from a lack of treatment and adequate response \nto requests for help and intervention for a mental health crisis.   \n214.  Mr. Carroll made a suicide attempt on September 22, 2017 in plain view of staff on \nthe tier by swallowing a handful of pills.  The staff ignored Mr. Carroll and did not immediately \nintervene to prevent the attempt or to provide immediate medical treatment until after the shift \nchange, between fifteen minutes and half an hour later.   \n215.  Following that attempt, Mr. Carroll was moved to EHCC for reasons unrelated to \nhis mental health. He was returned to DWCC shortly thereafter without any additional treatment \nplanning or diagnostics. \n216.  Following his return to DWCC, Mr. Carroll again attempted suicide by overdose \non or around January 16, 2018 and spent several days on suicide watch.  \n41 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 316   Filed 03/13/20   Page 42 of 59 PageID #:  5473\n217.  Mr. Carroll was placed on suicide watch following his attempt but was not provided \nwith any therapy or assessments and did not speak with Defendant Seal. Mr. Carroll is categorized \nas LOC 4, indicating mental illness that is not serious.  Since his arrival at DWCC his diagnosis \nhas been Depression NOS.  This diagnosis and level of care classification is not consistent with \nhis history of mental health treatment since the age of 8 or his persistent suicidal ideation and \nbehavior. \n  ii.  Prisoner AA \n218.  Prisoner AA is a man with significant mental illness who was held in extended \nlockdown and solitary confinement for an extended period at DWCC. During that period of time, \nhis mental illness deteriorated significantly.  \n219.  Prisoner AA wrote a sick call on February 17, 2016. He was not on DWCC’s mental \nhealth caseload at that time, despite having reported a history of major depression, and being \ndocumented as being disoriented, talking to himself, showing bizarre behavior, and having an \ninappropriate affect. The sick call requested help for depression, “heart hurting,” and trauma to \nhead when he thinks or speaks too loud.  \n220.  The responder wrote that Prisoner AA was referred to mental health. No mental \nhealth assessment or treatment occurred.  \n221.  On September 27, 2016, Prisoner AA filled out another sick call using incomplete \nsentences, including “Mental, Mind, Brain, Depression. Feeling like my Brain getting strip out \nhead…No Sleep only eyes close…need medication for Depression Direct head attack”. The \nresponder’s assessment was “no suicidal thoughts expressed” and notified mental health.  \n222.  He was seen a month later, on October 28, 2016, when Defendant Aerial Robinson \nreported “rapid speech and bizarre thought content”, and ordered a psychological consultation. On \n42 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 316   Filed 03/13/20   Page 43 of 59 PageID #:  5474\nOctober 31, 2016, Prisoner AA had a segregation interview, the only form of mental health \nmonitoring for prisoners without a diagnosis, and Steve Hayden wrote that he was “doing well” \nand denied any mental health concerns.  \n223.  Prisoner AA was seen by Defendant Seal on November 17, 2016, where he reported \ndepression, and requested Cannabis and Ultram, then Wellbutrin. Seal noted that Prisoner AA \n“didn’t want me to use my medical judgment”, he was irritable, with a circumstantial thought \nprocess, but Defendant Seal made no diagnosis of any underlying mental health condition. Prisoner \nAA was reaffirmed as LOC 5 in December 2016.  \n224.  On January 3, 2017, Prisoner AA wrote another sick call with illogical language, \nincluding “head inside out need brain scan…having out space problem Aliens!” The responder \nnoted that he complained of space aliens invading his body, and referred to mental health. No \nmental health treatment or evaluation was given.  \n225.  Prisoner AA wrote a similar sick call on January 5, 2017, noting “trauma to whole \nBrain having problems Body Reality missing”. The responder noted “no medical issues” and \nnotified mental health. No mental health treatment was given.  \n226.  Prisoner AA was seen for a compulsory segregation interview on January 25, 2017 \nby Steve Hayden. Hayden noted that Prisoner AA participated in casual conversation and reported \nno mental health concerns.  \n227.  Prisoner AA wrote a nonsensical sick call on March 8, 2017, and the responder \nwrote “unable to determine any specific medical problem” and determined “No tx [treatment] \nneeded”.  \n228.  On April 20, 2017, nurse Michelle Norris emailed Steve Hayden to request mental \nhealth contact because “Offender has rambling speech, flight of ideas.” Hayden responded seven \n43 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 316   Filed 03/13/20   Page 44 of 59 PageID #:  5475\ndays later, stating that Prisoner AA had already been seen by Defendant Seal and “is seen per \npolicy by mental health”. As a LOC 5, Prisoner AA would only receive a segregation interview \nevery 90 days, per policy.  \n229.  On April 21, 2017, Prisoner AA wrote another sick call that was still nonsensical \nand nearly illegible. The responder noted rambling speech and that Prisoner AA moved all \nextremities with extreme difficulty, and that he had last seen mental health on November 17, 2016. \nThe responder again referred to mental health. A different writer added a note “make sure and \nreviews these sick call requests”. No mental health treatment was given.  \n230.  On May 12, 2017, Prisoner AA wrote yet another rambling sick call with references \nto the bible and the FBI. The responder noted multiple random complaints, and no treatment \nneeded. Hayden again documented a segregation interview, according the note, Prisoner AA \nallegedly participated in conversation and had no complaints, with no apparent “acute distress.”  \n231.  Prisoner AA’s level of care was reviewed on May 25, 2017, and changed from 5 to \n5h. Another segregation interview was completed by Aerial Robinson on May 26, 2017, who found \nthat Prisoner AA was delusional with rapid, pressured speech, and had a preoccupation with \nconspiracy theories. She referred for psych consult and would “follow up per policy.”  \n232.  Prisoner AA, still without any mental health treatment, wrote another illogical sick \ncall on June 14, 2017. The responder noted rambling speech and difficulty moving limbs, but also \nnoted that he had already been referred to mental health on April 20, 2017.  \n233.  On August 24, 2017, months after staff documented their concerns about Prisoner \nAA’s mental status, Defendant Seal saw him again at clinic. Defendant Seal noted that staff \nreported that he seemed manic, talked about “the government,” and worked on blank sheets of \n44 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 316   Filed 03/13/20   Page 45 of 59 PageID #:  5476\npaper as if he were writing on them. Prisoner AA again asked for Wellbutrin and Ultram, and \nrefused other medication because “he’s worried ‘they will make me crazy.’”  \n234.  Seal recorded that Prisoner AA was hyper-verbal, tangential, and having auditory \nhallucinations, and diagnosed him with Bipolar I.  \n235.  Prisoner AA’s pleas for help resulted only in Defendants’ creation of inadequate, \nself-contradictory reports, often made by staff unlicensed to provide mental health observations \nand assessments. These reporting problems result in his severe mental illness being ignored and \nunderdiagnosed, left to further destabilize and fall deeper into paranoia and delusions.  \n236.  Months dragged on and more than a year passed, with sick calls and notes indicating \nprogressively worse deterioration in expressive ability and clarity of thought. Each sick call and \nclinical visit should have led to the obvious conclusion that Prisoner AA suffers from severe mental \nillness. Defendants did not transfer Prisoner AA to EHCC for mental health evaluation and \ntreatment until late 2017. \n  ii.  Terrence Goudeau \n237.  Terrence Goudeau, an individual with serious mental illnesses held on extended \nlockdown, frequently requested mental health evaluation and treatment from Defendants.  He \nnever received any such treatment.  He hanged himself in June 2016.  The death of Goudeau \nillustrates the serious harm that may come from the deliberate indifference of staff at DWCC to \nserious mental illness. \n  iv.  Tyler Blanchard \n238.  Tyler Blanchard is a man who reports a history of Bipolar, PTSD, and OCD. His \nonly diagnosis given by Defendant Seal is Depression. Shortly before 1:00AM on September 16, \n2016, an officer making rounds noticed that Mr. Blanchard was bleeding from his left forearm. \n45 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 316   Filed 03/13/20   Page 46 of 59 PageID #:  5477\nThe captain was notified, and Mr. Blanchard was placed in full restraints and escorted to the lobby, \nwhere a nurse cleaned his wounds.  \n239.  Defendant Assistant Warden Dauzat was contacted by the nurse, and verbally \nauthorized Extreme Suicide Watch with verbal concurrence from staff physician Dr. Fuller. \nDefendant Dauzat never saw or spoke to Mr. Blanchard, or offered any type of treatment. Mr. \nBlanchard was then returned to an observation cell while in full restraints. At about 2:45AM, the \nsame officer again noticed Mr. Blanchard bleeding from his arm. Mr. Blanchard was supposed to \nbe on 24-hr camera observation, but no one saw or prevented him from attempting suicide.  \n240.  Mr. Blanchard was again brought to the lobby in restraints to have his wounds \ncleaned. Defendant Dauzat was again called, and she directed that Mr. Blanchard be strapped to \nthe restraint chair, again without seeing him, speaking to him, or offering any type of mental health \ntreatment to a man who attempted suicide twice in a span of two hours. At 4:03AM, the same \nofficer, while making rounds, noticed that Mr. Blanchard was banging his head against the wall. \nWhile still on 24-hour camera observation for two consecutive suicide attempts, no other staff \nnoticed his active self-harm.  \n241.  Mr. Blanchard was then wheeled to the lobby, still strapped to the restraint chair, \nwhere a helmet was placed on his head at the authorization of Defendant Dauzat, and he was \nreturned to the cell. Mr. Blanchard was still not given any therapeutic intervention despite doing \neverything within his ability to harm himself.  \n242.  Later that day, Defendant Adkins, acting as chaplain, visited Mr. Blanchard. During \nthat visit, Adkins noted that Mr. Blanchard, who had each of his limbs strapped to a chair, able to \nmove only his neck, and had been kept there for several hours, was “not readily talkative”. After \n46 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 316   Filed 03/13/20   Page 47 of 59 PageID #:  5478\n12  hours  immobilized  in  the  restraint  chair,  Mr.  Blanchard  was  released  by  a  nurse,  and \ndowngraded to Standard Suicide Watch.  \n243.  Because it was the weekend, Mr. Blanchard did not see a mental health staff \nmember for another three days. For the three subsequent days, Mr. Blanchard reported thoughts of \nself-harm and suicide, without any therapeutic intervention. On the fourth day, he did not report \nsuch thoughts, and was released. Mr. Blanchard spent 32 days on suicide watch during 2016, and \ncut himself 5 times.  \n244.  He received no counseling or treatment other than Wellbutrin.  \n245.  Mr. Blanchard reports that he cuts himself to relieve pain and stress, because there \nis no other treatment provided. Mr. Blanchard reports that he continues to harm himself, often by \npunching his cell walls until his hands become injured. Defendants’ only response to this behavior \nis to threaten him with chemical restraints unless he stops the behavior.  \n246.  Mr. Blanchard states that he would like therapy or counseling to understand why \nhe hurts himself and how to avoid handling his feelings that way. Developing that type of insight \ninto  his  behavioral  problems  is  not  achievable  only  through  medication  and  medication \nmanagement. \n247.  Following this incident, Defendants made no changes to Mr. Blanchard’s mental \nhealth care treatment plan, and provided no counseling or other interventions. Mr. Blanchard \nremains on extended lockdown at DWCC. \n248.  Defendants are deliberately indifferent to the risks of harm to which they subjected \nMr. Charles, Mr. Turner, Mr. Jones, Mr. Brooks, Mr. Carroll, Mr. Goudeau, Prisoner AA, and Mr. \nBlanchard. \nE.  Defendants Respond Brutally to Symptoms of Mental Illness, Requests for Mental \nHealth Treatment, and Attempts to Redress Grievances \n47 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 316   Filed 03/13/20   Page 48 of 59 PageID #:  5479\n \n249.   There is a culture of cover-up and excessive force at David Wade, including \nexcessive use of chemical agents and force on prisoners with serious mental illness. This culture \nis established and tolerated by each of the named Defendants to this litigation.  \n250.  Prisoners reporting serious mental illness for themselves or others are threatened \nand receive serious disciplinary punishment, including Policy 34 and isolation. \n251.  Defendants have warned Mr. Charles and several putative Class members, all of \nwhom  are  constituents  of  the  Advocacy  Center,  that  their  continued  participation  in  the \ninvestigation of mental health conditions at DWCC would lead to retaliation. Defendants have \noffered promises of putting in a “good word” toward a transfer to another facility in exchange for \nindividual cooperation to cease participating in the investigation.  \n252.  A significant portion of individuals that undersigned counsel has met with over the \ncourse of responding to complaints about conditions at DWCC have intentionally been moved out \nof the prison. This includes many individuals with significant mental illness who were moved to \nacute care units elsewhere in the DPS&C. \nF.  Defendants Systematically Deny Plaintiffs Delivery of Mail to and from Counsel. \n \n253.  Defendants interfere with ability of the Advocacy Center and its representatives to \ncollect facts and discern legally relevant conditions at DWCC by intentionally denying prisoners \nthe ability to send letters to the Advocacy Center and MacArthur Justice Center. \n254.  The volume of correspondence that prisoners have sent to the Advocacy Center and \nMacArthur Justice Center but which never arrived demonstrates a clear pattern of interference \ndirected at deliberately and systematically preventing correspondence between Plaintiffs and their \ncounsel. \n48 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 316   Filed 03/13/20   Page 49 of 59 PageID #:  5480\n255.  There is no legitimate penological interest in destroying or misplacing mail to \ncounsel.  \n256.  Plaintiffs’ correspondence with counsel in this case is related to non-frivolous \nclaims under the Constitution and federal law.  \n257.  Defendants  additionally  have  a  policy  of  seizing  documents  and  disciplining \nprisoners who bring legal documents to attorney visits if that document has another prisoner’s \nname on it. This practice intimidates potential witnesses, invades the attorney client privilege, and \ninterferes with peoples’ access to information and the courts by prejudicing their ability to \ncommunicate with counsel. \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \nPLAINTIFF CLASS AND SUB-CLASS DEFINED \n258.  Plaintiffs bring this action under 42 U.S.C. §1983, for violations of the First and \nEighth Amendments to the United States Constitution on behalf of all prisoners currently held, or \nwho will in the future be held, in extended lockdown at DWCC in the N-1, N-2, N-3, and N-4 \nbuildings. \n259.  Plaintiffs also bring this action under the ADA and Section 504 on behalf of a sub-\nclass of all prisoners with disabilities related to mental health, or who are perceived as having such \ndisabilities, currently held, or who will in the future be held, in extended lockdown at DWCC in \nN-1, N-2, N-3, and N-4.  \nA.  The Class Satisfies the Elements of Fed. R. Civ. P. 23 \n  1.  Numerosity \n260.  The members of the class are too numerous and fluid to be joined as individual \nparties to this litigation.  \n49 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 316   Filed 03/13/20   Page 50 of 59 PageID #:  5481\n261.  The South Compound is comprised of five buildings, N-1 through N-5. Buildings \nN-1 through N-4 are “extended lockdown” units subject to this litigation. In each of the buildings \nthere are four tiers.  On each tier are 16 cells, some of which are individual cells and some of which \nare doubled.  In each of the four buildings, there are 64 cells.  At a maximum, if each cell on a \nbuilding houses double cells there are 128 individuals in the building.  At a given time, there could \nbe upwards of 500 individuals being housed in the South Compound. \n262.  According to a report issued in 2017 by the Department of Justice’s Bureau of \nJustice Statistics, 37% of prison inmates have a mental health diagnosis.2 That same report \nindicated  that  during  any  given  30-day  period,  approximately  14%  of  prison  inmates  are \nexperiencing  “serious  psychological  distress”  according  to  the  criteria  of  the  study’s \nmethodology.3 \n263.  The number of individuals housed on lockdown at DWCC with mental illness is \nsignificantly higher than these national statistics because of the practices of the Defendants, \noutlined above, which utilize the extended lockdown compound as a substitute mental health unit \nthat in turn creates and exacerbates mental illness.  \n264.  Joinder of the individuals in this Class is impracticable because prisoners are \nroutinely transferred in and out of DWCC as well as transferred between general population and \nextended lockdown.  Regardless of the duration of time an individual may be housed on extended \nlockdown before transferring out, he is still forced to endure the inhumane and unlawful conditions \ncultivated by the Defendants.   \n                                                \n2 Department of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics, Indicators of Mental Health Problems Reported by Prisoners \nand Jail Inmates, 2011-12 (2017) http://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=pbdetail&iid=5946 (last visited December 4, \n2017) \n \n3 Id. \n50 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 316   Filed 03/13/20   Page 51 of 59 PageID #:  5482\n265.  This Class also contains future members.  \n266.  The sheer number of affected individuals, the fluidity of the Class members, and \nthe  fact  that  the  proposed  Class  contains  future  members  all  militate  toward  a  finding  of \nnumerosity.  \n  2.  Commonality \n267.  The violations of the Eighth Amendment, ADA, and Section 504 alleged herein are \ncaused by the policies and systemic practices of the Defendants.  \n268.  Each prisoner held in extended lockdown is harmed by the brutal and inhumane \nconditions inflicted on prisoners in extended lockdown. Every individual housed in DWCC’s \nlockdown  units  is  subjected  to  the  Defendants’  deliberate  indifference  to  unconstitutional \nconditions of confinement and is exposed to the risk of serious mental illness or self-harm.  \n269.  Each  individual  on  extended  lockdown,  and  especially  those  in  solitary \nconfinement, is placed at extreme risk of developing a mental illness due to Defendants’ policies, \npractices and procedures. \n270.  Each claim shares a common core of fact and law: First, there is the factual question \nof Defendants’ implementation of the policies and practices as described herein. The questions of \nfact and law as to whether those policies create an objective risk of serious harm are also shared \nacross the entire Class, regardless of whether each individual Class member exposed to the risk \ndeveloped symptoms. And, finally, the entire Class shares the common question of whether \nDefendants’ subjective intent in carrying out these policies was deliberately indifferent to the risks. \n  3.  Typicality \n271.  Bruce Charles, Carlton Turner, Larry Jones, and Ronald Brooks, (hereinafter “class \nrepresentatives”) are typical members of the Class.  \n51 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 316   Filed 03/13/20   Page 52 of 59 PageID #:  5483\n272.  Plaintiffs  reallege the facts  above  to  show  that  they  have  all  been  failed  by \nDefendants’ system of care, subjected to brutal conditions, and suffered grievous harm. \n273.  The inadequacies of initial screening have harmed the class representatives. The \nclass representatives were all exposed to significant risks due to failure to identify significant \nmental illness. Mr. Charles was categorized as having no significant mental illness despite having \na diagnosis of bipolar disorder and being on suicide watch at the time of his evaluation. Paragraphs \n128-37. Mr. Turner lost his diagnoses of intermittent explosive disorder and borderline personality \ndisorder immediately upon his arrival at DWCC. Paragraphs 160-61.  \n274.  Requests for mental health treatment and reports of mental health crisis by the class \nrepresentatives were met with little to no response. Mr. Charles was repeatedly placed on suicide \nwatch with no meaningful interventions to address the root cause. Paragraphs 135-153.  Mr. Turner \nhas also been repeatedly placed on suicide watch without any meaningful treatment. Paragraphs \n171, 174-76. Mr. Jones’ statement that he was suffering a bipolar episode and that he did not know \nwhat to do resulted in the use of chemical spray and a write-up for incitement to a disturbance. \nParagraph 191-93. Mr. Brooks’ request for help with his trouble adjusting to segregation at DWCC \nwas completely ignored. Paragraph 205. \n275.  Following placement on suicide watch, none of the class representative have ever \nreceived any additional screenings, diagnostics, or other mental health care as a result of their \nheightened risk of self-harm. \n276.  Like all prisoners on extended lockdown at DWCC, the class representatives are \nnot provided access to counseling, group therapy, or support groups. Any communications with \nDefendant Seal are not confidential and do not promote communication of issues relating to mental \nillness.  Plaintiffs are not provided with individualized treatment plans and goals.  Each class \n52 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 316   Filed 03/13/20   Page 53 of 59 PageID #:  5484\nrepresentative with a treatment plan received the same treatment plan with the same generalized \ngoals that are not tailored to address issues relating to mental illness. Paragraphs 78-84. \n277.  The class representatives are subjected to suicide watch and extreme suicide watch \nsimply because it is Defendants’ only available response to any mental health issue or crisis. \nDefendants frequently placed Mr. Charles on suicide watch as an alternative to providing mental \nhealth treatment. Paragraphs 135, 144, and 151-52. Mr. Turner also received suicide watch as a \nsubstitute for mental health treatment. Paragraphs 164, 174. When Mr. Jones experienced a bipolar \nepisode while on suicide watch, there was no further mental health help available at DWCC. \nParagraph 191-93. \n278.  The named Plaintiffs are frequently deprived of medications used to treat symptoms \nof mental illness or are provided medications that are ineffective at treating the symptoms.  Mr. \nCharles was not provided with medications when he arrived at DWCC until at least after June 9, \n2016. After having been deprived of his medication for one week, Mr. Charles attempted suicide \nthree days after restarting his medication. Paragraph 128-37.  \n279.  Each individual class representative advances the same legal theories, claims, and \nevidence. \n280.  Each individual class representative is seeking the same relief from this Court. \n  4.  Adequacy \n281.  The class representatives are capable of representing the interests of absentee class \nmembers.  \n282.  There is no conflict of interest between Plaintiffs and Class members and the \nrepresentatives have common interests with the unnamed members.  All claims of named and \n53 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 316   Filed 03/13/20   Page 54 of 59 PageID #:  5485\nunnamed members rest upon the policies, procedures, and practices of Defendants as a whole, and \nas such apply to all individuals housed in extended lockdown. \n283.  Class counsel are all members in good standing with the Louisiana Bar and Middle \nDistrict of Louisiana. Counsel is experienced in the conduct of class action litigation and prison \nlitigation.  \n284.  Class counsel have been conducting an investigation into conditions at DWCC for \nsome time.  Counsel successfully litigated against the officials of the DPS&C to address counsel’s \naccess to the prisoners and facilities at DWCC in furtherance of that investigation and have worked \nwith the DPS&C and Defendants to address issues under that settlement agreement. \n285.  Counsel from the Advocacy Center is empowered under federal law and recognized \nby the state of Louisiana as the state’s Protection and Advocacy group for individuals with \ndisabilities, including mental illness. The Advocacy Center’s statutory mandate is to protect the \nhuman and civil rights of people with disabilities. \nB.  The Sub-Class Satisfies the Elements of Fed. R. Civ. P. 23 \n286.  Each named Plaintiff is a representative of the class as well as the sub-class. \n287.  Each named Plaintiff is a person with a disability, and therefore a member of the \nSub-Class. \n288.  The claims for the violation of the ADA and Section 504, like the claims for the \nviolation of the Eighth Amendment, are based on the allegation that Defendants have been \nviolating the law by following their policies and practices. \n289.  The request for certification of the sub-class is otherwise identical to the request for \ncertification of the Class. \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \n54 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 316   Filed 03/13/20   Page 55 of 59 PageID #:  5486\nA.  Violations of the Eighth Amendment (Cruel and Unusual Punishment)  \n \n290.  By their policies and practices described herein, Defendants deprive Plaintiffs and \nconstituents of the Advocacy Center of their constitutional right to be free from cruel and unusual \npunishment, protected by the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution.  \n291.  The practices outlined above subject Plaintiffs and constituents of the Advocacy \nCenter to a substantial risk of serious harm and injury.  \n292.  Defendants are aware of the risks of harm and are deliberately indifferent to those \nrisks.  \n293.  Housing prisoners in these conditions does not serve any legitimate penological \nneed.  \n294.  Defendants deprive Plaintiffs and constituents of the Advocacy Center of basic \nhuman needs and violate present day concepts of human dignity.  \n \nB.  Violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act  \n295.  Plaintiffs bring their claims for the violation of the ADA on behalf of the sub-class \nof individuals in extended lockdown who have mental illness. \n296.  Plaintiffs and constituents of the Advocacy Center have disabilities due to mental \nillness, which interfere with their major life activities. \n297.  Plaintiffs’ needs qualify them to receive mental health care, including therapy and \ncounseling. \n298.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate all allegations above herein.   \n299.  The Defendants knowingly and consistently discriminate against prisoners with \nmental disabilities, all of whom are constituents of the Advocacy Center, by failing to provide \n55 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 316   Filed 03/13/20   Page 56 of 59 PageID #:  5487\nthem with reasonable accommodation for their disabilities and punishing them for behavior that is \na product of their disabilities.  \n300.  Defendants have further knowingly discriminated against persons with disabilities, \nand constituents of the Advocacy Center, as the result of Defendants’ methods of administration \nof their solitary confinement, extended lockdown, and mental health programs. \n301.  By placing prisoners with mental illness in extended lockdown, Defendants have \ndenied prisoners with mental illness the benefits of the facility’s services, programs, and activities, \nincluding education, programming, recreation, exercise, and mental health treatment and services, \nthus discriminating against persons on the basis of their disability.  \n302.  Discrimination against prisoners with mental illness occurs particularly because \nprisoners do not receive mental health services sufficient to counteract the effects that extended \nlockdown and other forms of punishment have on mentally ill prisoners, which is more severe than \nthe impact it has on prisoners who are not mentally ill.  \n303.  The Defendants discriminate against prisoners with serious mental illness on the \nbasis of their disabilities. The Defendants routinely warehouse prisoners with serious mental \nillness in solitary confinement, and disproportionately place prisoners with serious mental illness \nin extended lockdown and especially solitary confinement.  \n304.  By  placing  prisoners  with  serious  mental  illness  in  extended  lockdown  and \nimposing behavior management plans and other forms of punishment, the Defendants (a) failed to \nfurnish reasonable accommodation to prisoners with disabilities, (b) punish prisoners with serious \nmental illnesses for disability-related conduct; and (c) deprive prisoners with mental illness of \naccess to adequate mental health care.  \nC.  Violation of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 \n56 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 316   Filed 03/13/20   Page 57 of 59 PageID #:  5488\n305.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate all allegations above herein.   \n306.  Plaintiffs qualify as individuals with disabilities as defined in Section 504 of the \nRehabilitation Act of 1973. They have mental impairments that substantially limit one or more \nmajor life activity, including but not limited to thinking, concentrating, interacting with others, and \ncontrolling their behavior. They have records of having such impairment or are regarded as having \nsuch an impairment.  \n307.  The Defendants discriminate against prisoners with disabilities, all of whom are \nconstituents of the Advocacy Center, by failing to provide reasonable accommodation for their \ndisabilities.  \n308.  Defendants discriminate against prisoners with disabilities solely on the basis of \ntheir disabilities in violation of Section 504.  \n309.  In  placing  prisoners  with  serious  mental  illness  in  extended  lockdown  the \nDefendants have deprived prisoners with mental illness from the benefits of the facility’s services, \nprograms, and activities, including education, programming, recreation, exercise, and mental \nhealth services, thus discriminating against them on the basis of their disabilities.  \nD.  Violation of the First Amendment   \n310.  Defendants have taken extraordinary steps to interfere with counsel’s investigation \nof conditions at DWCC by systematically interfering with mail sent by prisoners to their counsel, \nby punishing prisoners for bringing documents to attorney-client visits, and by refusing counsel \nthe ability to provide written materials prisoners. \n311.  Defendants’  interference  with  Plaintiffs’  communication  with  counsel  and \nretaliation based on the content of privileged documents violates the First Amendment. \n  \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \n57 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 316   Filed 03/13/20   Page 58 of 59 PageID #:  5489\n312.  Plaintiffs request this court grant them the following relief: \nA.  Declare that this suit is maintainable as a class action pursuant to Federal Rules of \nCivil Procedure 23(a) and (b)(2);  \nB.  Adjudge and declare that the acts, omissions, policies, and practices of Defendants, \ntheir agents, employees, officials, and all persons acting in concert with them under color of state \nlaw or otherwise described herein have violated the rights of prisoner Plaintiffs and the class they \nrepresent under the Eighth Amendment’s prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment and those \nrights protected by the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Rehabilitation Act; \nC.  Enter  injunctive  relief  enjoining  Defendants  and  their  agents  from  subjecting \nPlaintiffs to the illegal and unconstitutional conditions, acts, omissions, policies and practices set \nforth above; \nD.  Award Plaintiffs the costs of this suit, and reasonable attorneys’ fees and litigation \nexpenses pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1988 and other applicable law; \nE.  Retain jurisdiction of this case until all Defendants have fully complied with the \norders of this Court, and there is a reasonable assurance that Defendants will continued to comply \nin the future absent continuing jurisdiction; and  \nF.

CLAIMS AND EVIDENCE \n \n7 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 509   Filed 12/30/21   Page 8 of 43 PageID #:  24209\nI.  DEFENDANTS  VIOLATE  THE  EIGHTH  AMENDMENT  TO  THE \nCONSTITUTION BY SUBJECTING THE CLASS TO A SUBSTANTIAL RISK \nOF SERIOUS HARM \n \n19.  To determine if prison conditions satisfy the Eighth Amendment’s objective component \n“[t]he deprivation alleged must be, objectively, sufficiently serious.... [T]he inmate must show that \nhe is incarcerated under conditions posing a substantial risk of serious harm.” Farmer v. Brennan, \n511 U.S. 825, 834 (1994). \n20.  Additionally, the Eighth Amendment requires that “inmates be furnished with the basic \nhuman needs, one of which is reasonable safety.” Helling v. McKinney, 509 U.S. 25, 33 (1993). \n21.  Courts ask whether the conditions are contrary to “the evolving standards of decency that \nmark the progress of a maturing society,” Farmer, 511 U.S. at 833–34, or whether the incarcerated \nperson  has  been  denied  “the  minimal  civilized  measure  of  life’s  necessities.” Rhodes  v. \nChapman, 452 U.S. 337, 347 (1981). \n22.  These standards are not static. Chandler v. Crosby, 379 F.3d 1278, 1289 (11th Cir. 2004). \n23.  The Eighth Amendment not  only  protects  against  risk  of  harm  to  prisoners’  physical \nhealth, but also protects mental health care as a basic human need of which incarcerated people \ncannot be deprived. See, e.g., Calhoun v. DeTella, 319 F.3d 936, 940 (7th Cir. 2003); Meriwether \nv. Faulkner, 821 F.2d 408, 413 (7th Cir. 1987); Gates v. Cook, 376 F.3d 323, 343 (5th Cir. 2004), \nciting Partridge v. Two Unknown Police Officers of Houston, 791 F.2d 1182, 1187 (5th Cir. 1986). \n24.  “The same standards that protect against physical torture prohibit mental torture as well—\nincluding the mental torture of excessive deprivation.” Ruiz v. Johnson, 37 F.Supp.2d 855, 914 \n(S.D.Tex.1999), rev’d on other grounds, 243 F.3d 941 (5th Cir.2001), adhered to on remand, 154 \nF. Supp. 2d 975 (S.D. Tex. 2001). \n8 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 509   Filed 12/30/21   Page 9 of 43 PageID #:  24210\n25.  The Ruiz court, finding that prisoners had been subjected to “a systemic pattern of extreme \nsocial isolation and reduced environmental stimulation,” described the evolving standards of \ndecency recognizing psychological pain as follows: \nIn the past, courts faced with horrendous conditions of confinement have focused \non  the  basic  components  of  physical  sustenance—food,  shelter,  and  medical \ncare. See Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 \n(1994). More recently, in light of the maturation of our society’s understanding of \nthe very real psychological needs of human beings, courts have recognized the \ninhumanity of institutionally-imposed psychological pain and suffering. As the \nThird Circuit stated, “[t]he touchstone is the health of the inmate. While the prison \nadministration may punish, it may not do so in a manner that threatens the physical \nand mental health of prisoners.” Young, 960 F.2d at 364 (emphasis added).  \n \nRuiz, 37 F. Supp. 2d at 914.  \n26.  Like mental health care, social interaction and environmental stimulation are basic human \nneeds. Wilkerson v. Stalder, 639 F. Supp. 2d 654, 678 (M.D. La. 2007); citing Ruiz, 37 F. Supp. \n2d at 855, Rhodes, 452 U.S. at 346.  \n27.  “Conditions  of  confinement  may  establish  an  Eighth  Amendment  violation  ‘in \ncombination’ when each would not do so alone, but only when they have a mutually enforcing \neffect that produces the deprivation of a single, identifiable human need . . . .”. Gates, 376 F.3d at \n333. \n28.  Although certain conditions standing alone might not rise to the level of a constitutional \nviolation, a combination of conditions having a “mutually enforcing effect that produces the \ndeprivation of a single identifiable human need such as food, warmth or exercise—for example, a \nlow cell temperature at night combined with a failure to issue blankets,” may state a claim under \nthe Eighth Amendment. Wilkerson, 639 F. Supp. 2d at 679; citing Wilson v. Seiter, 501 U.S. 294, \n305 (1991). \n9 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 509   Filed 12/30/21   Page 10 of 43 PageID #: \n24211\n29.  Both the Supreme Court and the Fifth Circuit have recognized that certain conditions that \nwould  pass  constitutional  scrutiny  if  imposed  for  a  short  period  of  time  may  be  rendered \nunconstitutional if imposed for an extended period of time. Wilkerson, 639 F. Supp. 2d at 679, \nciting Gates, 376  F.3d  at  333,  Hutto  v.  Finney, 437  U.S.  678,  686–872  (1978),  see \nalso Meriwether, 821 F.2d at 416 (“[T]he duration of a prisoner’s confinement in administrative \nsegregation or under lockdown restrictions is certainly an important factor in evaluating whether \nthe totality of the conditions of confinement constitute cruel and unusual punishment.”).  \n30.  In class actions challenging systemic health care deficiencies, a risk of harm to people’s \nhealth needs may be shown by proving “repeated examples of negligent acts which disclose a \npattern of conduct by the prison medical staff,” or by proving there are such “systemic and gross \ndeficiencies in staffing, facilities, equipment, or procedures” such that the inmate population is \neffectively denied access to adequate medical care. Ramos v. Lamm, 639 F.2d 559, 575 (10th Cir. \n1980) (citations omitted); Williams v. Edwards, 547 F.2d 1206, 1215-16 (5th Cir. 1977); Lawson \nv. Dallas Cnty., 112 F. Supp. 2d 616, 635 (N.D. Tex. 2000). \n31.  The test is whether a cognizable risk of harm exists, not whether the consequences of that \nrisk have manifested as harm; the goal of the courts is to prevent harm where such a risk exists. \nSee Gates, 376 F.3d at 341 (emphasis added) (holding that an Eighth Amendment plaintiff did not \nhave to prove that he was actually injured by exposure to raw sewage, only that such exposure \nposed a serious health risk), Hudson v. McMillian, 503 U.S. 1, 4 (1992) (holding that excessive \nphysical force against a prisoner can constitute cruel and unusual punishment even if the prisoner \ndoes not suffer serious injury). \n32.  The risk associated with placing people in lockdown conditions of the severity of those \nimplemented at David Wade has been widely recognized as unconstitutional by courts. Madrid v. \n10 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 509   Filed 12/30/21   Page 11 of 43 PageID #: \n24212\nGomez, 889 F. Supp. 1146, 1265–66 (N.D. Cal. 1995) (internal citations omitted), Braggs v. Dunn, \n257 F. Supp. 3d 1171, 1192 (M.D. Ala. 2017) (finding mental health programs offered in restrictive \nhousing  by  the  Alabama  Department  of  Corrections  unconstitutional  under  the  Eighth \nAmendment). \nA.  The Defendants’ failure to provide adequate mental health care creates a substantial \nrisk of harm.  \n \n33.  Defendants’  failure  to  appropriately  identify  or  diagnose  mental  illness,  inadequate \nmedication administration practices, harsh conditions of confinement, substandard suicide watch \nconditions, and security practices all combine to create a substantial risk of serious harm.   \n34.  It is anticipated that classification and security staff will provide testimony that all people \nwho are transferred to DWCC are housed in lockdown for a period of time prior to being moved \nto general population. \n35.  Plaintiffs will show through the testimony and medical and mental health records of \nprisoners at DWCC that individuals housed on extended lockdown at DWCC have disabilities due \nto mental illness, which interfere with their major life activities as defined by the Americans with \nDisabilities Act. \n36.  Staff  at  DWCC  are  expected  to  testify  that  the  intake  screenings  performed  by  the \nDefendants are inadequate, and are not reviewed by a licensed mental health care professional.  \n37.  Plaintiffs’ also will enter into evidence the intake screenings performed by staff at DWCC.  \n38.  Prisoner records show that the Defendants rely heavily on information that is gathered at \nEHCC’s reception and diagnostic center (HRDC), even if a prisoner has not been transferred \ndirectly from EHCC, and even if their initial assessment was done some time ago. \n39.  Defendants and staff of the named Defendants are expected to testify that when an \nindividual is placed on extended lockdown for a disciplinary reason, Defendants do not conduct a \n11 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 509   Filed 12/30/21   Page 12 of 43 PageID #: \n24213\nreview of records to identify whether the person has a mental health diagnosis that would require \ntreatment or care inconsistent with the extreme isolation of solitary confinement or extended \nlockdown. \n40.  Documentary evidence will show that if screening mechanisms are conducted before \nplacement  on  extended  lockdown,  Defendants  disregard  the  information  available  in  the \nindividual’s mental health records. \n41.  Defendants’ mental health intake screenings themselves, and testimony from the staff, will \nshow that their intake procedures are inadequate to detect major changes in a person’s mental \nhealth, which is especially dangerous when the person’s HRDC intake screening is old. \n42.  This results in mental health intake screenings failing protect people with mental illness \nfrom the harmful effects of placement on extended lockdown. \n43.  Documentary evidence and testimony will show that people known to the Defendants to \nhave  serious  mental  illnesses  (SMI),  including  extensive  histories  of  suicidal  ideation  and \nbehavior, are routinely placed on extended lockdown at DWCC. \n44.  The absence of observation and monitoring of individuals on extended lockdown means \nthat psychiatric decompensation goes unnoticed, as does the onset of new symptoms. This is \nevidenced by extensive indications of decompensation in prisoners’ medical and mental health \nrecords, their master prison records, and their anticipated testimony.  \n45.  Plaintiffs’ experts will testify that Defendants fail to identify people with serious mental \nillness and consistently understate the severity of mental illness where it is identified.  \n46.  Plaintiffs’ experts will testify and documentary evidence will show that even when an \nindividual with mental illness is identified, every person receives the same treatment plan, which \ndoes not actually provide for treatment. \n12 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 509   Filed 12/30/21   Page 13 of 43 PageID #: \n24214\n47.  Plaintiffs’ experts will testify that Defendants do not provide appropriate treatment for \nthose suffering from mental illness. This results in a substantial risk of serious harm in the form of \nincreased suffering, injury and the possibility of lethality for the Plaintiff class members. \n48.  The expert testimony of the Plaintiffs will show that medication management, on its own, \nis not adequate mental health care. The failure to supplement medication management with other \nforms of mental health care creates a substantial risk of harm to patients. \n49.  Plaintiffs’ experts will testify that in order to meet adequate care, in addition to offering \nmedication and medication management, a mental health program must also contain treatment \noptions such as group counseling, individual counseling, and programming to assist patients in \nmanaging the symptoms of mental illness. \nB.  Defendants do not appropriately provide treatment for mental illness, resulting in \nsuffering and injury to the men at DWCC and creating a substantial risk of serious \nharm. \n \n50.  Testimony will show that people on extended lockdown receive virtually no treatment for \nmental illness. \n51.  Policy documents and testimony will show that there is no individual counseling, group \ntherapy, or support group available for people on extended lockdown, regardless of an individual’s \ndiagnosis or response to medication. \n52.  Testimony and documentary evidence will show that people on lockdown in DWCC only \nhave contact with a contracting psychiatrist, Defendant Seal, every three months, and that: \n53.  People are unable to otherwise request visits with Defendant Seal. \n54.  Visits with the psychiatrist last approximately 3-5 minutes according to testimony. \n13 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 509   Filed 12/30/21   Page 14 of 43 PageID #: \n24215\n55.  A security officer is present in the room at every psychiatrist visit, and thus, if the patient \nwants to seek mental health care related to treatment by security staff, there is no confidentiality \nor privacy. \n56.  Visits with the psychiatrist lack indicia of either diagnostic or psychotherapeutic purpose \ndue to their short duration, infrequency, and lack of confidentiality. \n57.  Defendant Seal is expected to testify that he never prescribes counseling, group therapy, or \nany intervention other than medication management. \n58.  Defendant Seal is retained by DWCC only to provide medication management visits to \npeople. \n59.  Experts will testify that the mental health staffing at DWCC is inadequate to provide a \nminimum of care. \n60.  In the event that a person does not receive a prescription for any medication from \nDefendant Seal, that individual receives no mental health treatment or plan whatsoever. \n61.  The Defendants’ treatment plan template indicates that a mechanism for achievement \nshould be coded beside each short-term goal, identifying how Defendants will help the individual \nto achieve each identified goal. No treatment method codes are ever displayed and there is never \nany narrative explanation of a treatment method. \n62.  The plans themselves show that they are also completely devoid of any required actions on \nthe part of DWCC to provide any monitoring, counseling, or therapy, regardless of any patient’s \nmedical history, diagnosis, or circumstances. \n63.  The treatment methods in the treatment plans for everyone on extended lockdown are \nabsent. Each form cryptically states: “Treatment Methods: on-going.” \n14 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 509   Filed 12/30/21   Page 15 of 43 PageID #: \n24216\n64.  Defendants’ treatment plans will show that Defendant Steve Hayden signed all mental \nhealth treatment plans for the named Plaintiffs identifying himself as a “therapist.” \n65.  Mr. Hayden is not licensed by the State of Louisiana to provide mental health care in any \ncapacity. \nC.  Defendants’  medication  management  practices  are  inadequate  and  create  a \nsubstantial risk of serious harm. \n \n66.  The  Plaintiffs  will  present  testimony  and  documentary  evidence  showing  that  only \nmedication management is provided for individuals who are prescribed medicine and on the mental \nhealth case load. \n67.  In addition, the Plaintiffs will show through the records of the Defendants, the testimony \nof the experts, DWCC staff, and Plaintiff class members that the system for medication distribution \nat DWCC is insufficient and leaves class members at serious risk of harm. \n68.  Some Plaintiff class members are deprived of their medication when they arrive at DWCC \nand their medication is discontinued. Testimony from the staff at DWCC and Plaintiff class \nmembers will show that some class members who arrive at David Wade are taken off of mental \nhealth medication that has long been a part of their treatment plan. \n69.  Documentary evidence and testimony from Plaintiff class members and staff at DWCC \nwill show that other Plaintiff class members are deprived of their medication because of the \nimproper medication administration practices at David Wade. \n70.  This deprivation includes instances of Defendants discontinuing the medications that were \nbeing  prescribed  and  administered  in  the  facilities  where  the  individuals  were  confined \nimmediately prior to the transfer.  \n15 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 509   Filed 12/30/21   Page 16 of 43 PageID #: \n24217\n71.  As a result of the discontinuation of medication upon arrival to DWCC, a person often \nwaits weeks without necessary medication, until he meets with Defendant Seal, receives a new \nprescription, and is integrated into the medication distribution rotation. \n72.  Documentary evidence will show that individuals who refuse medications are diagnosed \nas “in remission” despite a lack of review by a psychiatrist to determine whether the change in \ndiagnosis is appropriate. \n73.  Through  testimony  of  the  staff  that  administers  medication  and  the  Medication \nAdministration Records (MARs) Plaintiffs will show gaping holes in the distribution of medication \nto Plaintiff class members. \n74.  Plaintiffs’ experts will testify that these days and sometimes weeks without mental health \nmedication can cause the Plaintiff class members’ mental illnesses to worsen and for them to \ndecompensate. \n75.  The failure to provide even the bare minimum of mental health treatment in the form of \nmedication leaves class members unnecessarily cycling on and off psychotropic medications, and \ndoing so without any safety net of other care or counseling. \n76.  The evidence will show that pill call officers who administer medications to prisoners on \nextended lockdown are security staff who have received training to pass out medications. \n77.  Defendant Seal’s clinical notes are often inconsistent with the medication distribution \nnotes, as will be demonstrated through testimony and documentary evidence. \n78.  Testimony will show that missed doses of medication do not prompt any notification to a \npsychiatrist  or  medical  staff,  despite  possible  mental  and  physical  side  effects  of  suddenly \ndiscontinuing psychotropic medications. \n16 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 509   Filed 12/30/21   Page 17 of 43 PageID #: \n24218\n79.  Medication distribution documentation improperly and inconsistently note instances of \nrefused medication, including psychotropic medication. \n80.  Documentary evidence will show that medications are marked as having been administered \nto people who are not physically present in the facility. \n81.  Medication administration documentation for the quantity of medication administered does \nnot match the medication refill ordering information. \n82.  Medication administration records show no doses administered for days at a time across \nthe extended lockdown tiers. \n83.  Plaintiffs’ experts will testify that Defendants’ medication administration and record \nkeeping reflects a breakdown in supervision, training, and accountability in the handling of \nmedications. This failure places the patients on extended lockdown at risk. \n84.  Extensive testimony from Plaintiff class members, Plaintiffs’ experts, and documentary \nevidence will show that Defendants do not respond to decompensation or mental health crisis, \ncreating a substantial risk of serious harm. \nD. Defendants’ suicide watch policies create a substantial risk of serious harm. \n \n85.  When the lack of mental health treatment causes some class members to decompensate, \ndisplay self-injurious behavior, or to become suicidal the only remedy provided by Defendants are \nthe stark conditions of suicide watch.  \n86.  Testimony from Plaintiff class members and Plaintiff experts will explain that if a person \non lockdown requests mental health care, he will usually be placed on suicide watch. \n87.  Defendants’ own policies will show that the two forms of suicide watch at David Wade \neach include a stripped-down cell in which class members are left with no mattress, no clothing \nexcept for a paper gown, and no personal items for 24 hours a day. \n17 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 509   Filed 12/30/21   Page 18 of 43 PageID #: \n24219\n88.  During a person’s time on suicide watch there is no additional mental health counseling \nprovided. Plaintiffs will show that the only mental health follow up provided for class members is \nperformed 7 days after they are released from suicide watch.   \n89.  Testimony and documentary evidence will show that DWCC staff sometimes restrain \nindividuals in a restraint chair, used for extreme suicide watch for days at a time, and often use the \nchair rather than providing actual mental health care. \n90.  Plaintiff class member testimony and prisoner records will show DWCC staff engage in \ntargeted punishment of suicidal people. \n91.  Per their own policy Defendants refuse to allow people on suicide watch to visit with \nrelatives or use the telephone to access any source of outside emotional support. \n92.  Testimony from DWCC staff members will show that although the facility possesses \nsuicide resistant mattresses, those mattresses are often not given to people on suicide watch, who \nmust stand and sleep on the concrete without clothing and shoes. \n93.   In the winter, the cells can be extremely cold. \n94.  The testimony will show that staff open windows near the suicide watch cells to make \nconditions even colder. \n95.  When on suicide watch individuals do not have shoes or mattresses, so people must stand \nbarefoot on concrete in a small paper gown. \n96.  Plaintiff experts will opine that the conditions and practices regarding suicide watch work \ntogether to deter people from reporting mental health emergencies, create a substantial risk of harm \nand deprive people of life’s basic necessities. \n18 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 509   Filed 12/30/21   Page 19 of 43 PageID #: \n24220\n97.  In concert with the lack of general mental health screening and treatment by qualified staff, \nDefendants use isolation and suicide watch as a response to any urgent request for mental health \nservices, even if the request does not express suicidal ideation or threats of self-harm. \n98.  Staff  testimony,  Plaintiff  class  member  testimony,  and  documentary  evidence  will \ndemonstrate that staff visits to people being held on suicide watch are purely to determine whether \nthe individual remains a threat to himself. \n99.  The conversations between staff and an individual on suicide watch are at cell-front, short \nand do not include any attempt to ascertain whether the individual is suffering from worsening \nmental illness or is experiencing a crisis manifestation of a chronic mental illness. \n100.  When a person is on suicide watch the underlying mental illness causing the self-harm risk \nis not addressed, because of the complete lack of other mental health treatment and screening. \n101.  As evidenced by the Defendants’ own records, the lack of mental health care at DWCC \noften results in people returning to suicide watch multiple times. \n102.  Plaintiffs’ experts will testify that the harsh conditions of suicide watch and lack of \ntreatment trigger psychiatric deterioration and decompensation of individuals. \n103.  The testimony will show that if a person refuses suicide watch and requests other care, he \nmay face a disciplinary charge of malingering. \n104.  Plaintiffs’ experts will testify that the stark conditions of suicide watch create a substantial \nrisk of serious harm. \n105.  Plaintiffs’ experts will testify that the conditions of suicide watch at David Wade do not \nmeet a penological interest. \nE.  Inadequate record keeping at DWCC creates a substantial risk of serious harm. \n \n19 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 509   Filed 12/30/21   Page 20 of 43 PageID #: \n24221\n106.  The record-keeping practices at DWCC are unreliable and dangerous, as evidenced by the \nrecords themselves. Diagnoses shift without explanation and Defendants discontinue or alter drug \nregimens with little or no paper trail. \n107.  The documentation of segregation interviews show that they are cursory and diagnostically \nunhelpful. \n108.  The documentation produced as a result of a routine segregation interview will nearly \nuniversally indicate that the individual is “within normal limits” in all areas, even for people with \nserious mental health diagnoses, which indicates a failure to conduct a comprehensive segregation \ninterview. \n109.  The documentation will show that these interviews typcially note that the individual \nengaged  in  minimal  conversation,  which  indicates  a  failure  to  conduct  a  comprehensive \nsegregation interview. \n110.  Even when patients have requested mental health care or are presently on suicide watch, \nsegregation interviews fail to document these concerns. \n111.  These records do not include adequate detail to understand the status of the patient. \n112.  This results in the signs and symptoms of serious mental illness remaining unidentified or \nuntreated and people experiencing crisis manifestations of mental illness are not detected before \nthe person is a significant risk to himself or others. \n113.  The testimony will show that Defendants do not conduct screenings or make mental health \nresources available to people with a pattern of suicidal ideation, even in the face of repeated mental \nhealth crises. \n20 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 509   Filed 12/30/21   Page 21 of 43 PageID #: \n24222\n114.  Documentary evidence and testimony will show that manifestations of illness that fall short \nof self-harm or suicidal ideation are treated as disciplinary violations and produce no mental health \ntreatment or follow-up. \n115.  Mental  health  staff  at  DWCC  frequently  make  decisions  that  are  inconsistent  with \nindividual health concerns that are clearly apparent in their own records. \nF.  Defendants’ mental health staffing is inadequate such that it creates a substantial \nrisk of serious harm. \n \n116.  Defendants’ own records show that Defendant Steve Hayden is not licensed to provide \nmental health care, yet he makes most day-to-day decisions about care. \n117.  The evidence and testimony will show that when Defendant Hayden does walk-through \nthe extended lockdown facilities, he does not provide any counseling services or individualized \ncare. \n118.  The documentary evidence will show that Asst. Warden Dauzat authorizes care and \ntreatment for individuals on extended lockdown without having ever seen her putative patients. \n119.  Dr. Seal’s contract, his testimony and his treatment records will show that he is present at \nthe prison for an anemic number of hours to treat the number of Plaintiff class members held in \nextended lockdown. \nG. Defendants security practices create a substantial risk of serious harm. \n \n120.  Defendants’ own policies will show that they employ disciplinary practices that are outside \nthe formal structures of discipline for the prison. \n121.  One such example is Policy 34, which is independent of any formal disciplinary sentence. \n122.  Policy 34, according to the text of the policy, is deployed at staff discretion with no due \nprocess protections or hearings. The absence of any procedural safeguards allows a staff member \n21 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 509   Filed 12/30/21   Page 22 of 43 PageID #: \n24223\nwho becomes upset with an individual to simply put the individual on Policy 34 without any \nshowing that the person has violated any institutional rules. \n123.  On Policy 34, according to the policy itself, people are not allowed a mattress outside of \nthe hours of 9pm to 5am. \n124.  Testimony will show that mattresses are frequently not returned timely or at all. \n125.  Testimony and documentary evidence will also show that people will be housed on Policy \n34 Strip Cell for thirty days or more, at the whim of the ranking correctional officers. \n126.  The foregoing evidence shows that Policy 34 status is strictly punitive. \n127.  The text of Policy 34 shows that is not imposed through DWCC’s disciplinary process. It \nis imposed directly by staff. \n128.  Policy 34 is devoid of language that would subject a decision made under the policy to \nappeals or other processes associated with other disciplinary sanctions. \n129.  Policies from the prison and testimony show that prior to the adoption of the pilot \ndisciplinary  matrix  in  December  2019,  DWCC  would  impose  a  disciplinary  penalty  called \n“isolation” in which a person is not allowed a jumpsuit, mattress, or other personal property. This \npenalty was imposed in 10-day increments. \n130.  Classification documents and DWCC policy show that the classification of “extended \nlockdown”  at  DWCC  is  imposed  until  the  person  is  reclassified  as  medium  custody  and \nrecommended for movement to general population by the classification review board. \n131.  A person whose custody status is being reviewed by the classification review board is not \npresent for the classification review board meeting, as will be shown via prison policies and \ntestimony. \n22 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 509   Filed 12/30/21   Page 23 of 43 PageID #: \n24224\n132.  Testimony  and  documentary  evidence  will  show  that  people  held  in  preventative \nsegregation are housed in the same conditions as are people held on disciplinary segregation. \n133.  The same evidence shows that people held in preventative segregation are afforded the \nsame privileges as are people held on disciplinary segregation. \n134.   Per DWCC policy people held in preventative segregation are housed in their cell for 23 \nhours per day. \n135.  Also, per DWCC policy, people held in preventative segregation are held in preventative \nsegregation until they are reclassified as medium custody by the classification board. \n136.  DWCC policy and records confirm that there is no maximum time limit on a person’s \nplacement in extended lockdown. \n137.  The same evidence shows that there is no maximum time limit for which a person can be \nheld in preventative segregation. \n138.  Testimony from DWCC staff, Plaintiff class members, and the prisons own policies make \nit clear that all people on extended lockdown are held in the same conditions of confinement. \n139.  All people on extended lockdown are held in the same conditions, regardless of individual \nmental health disabilities. \n140.  The evidence will show that Defendants respond to yelling, cursing, refusing to move, and \nother behavior potentially diagnostic of untreated mental illness as a disciplinary matter rather than \na mental health symptom. \nH. The stark conditions of confinement at DWCC create a substantial risk of serious \nharm. \n \n141.  Prison documents and anticipated testimony from prison staff will show that there is no \ndesignated mental health unit or tier at David Wade Correctional Center. \n23 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 509   Filed 12/30/21   Page 24 of 43 PageID #: \n24225\n142.  Policy dictates that, and testimony will confirm that people on extended lockdown are \nallowed one ten-minute phone call per month. \n143.  The one 10-minute phone call per month for individuals on extended lockdown is not at a \nregularly scheduled time and thus there is no way to plan for a family member to be available for \nthe phone call. \n144.  Anticipated testimony will explain how staff may refuse an individual’s phone call without \ngiving any reason. \n145.  Anticipated testimony will describe how staff will often refuse to allow a person to make \na phone call as retaliation against the individual requesting the call. \n146.  The restrictive nature of the housing arrangements on extended lockdown mean that \nindividuals on extended lockdown are unable to make attorney phone calls without first getting \npermission from a security officer. \n147.  Per prison policy, there are no televisions on the tiers in the N2, N3 or N4 buildings and \nprisoners are not permitted access to radios or other music or sound producing devices on the tiers \nin the N2, N3, or N4 buildings. \n148.  People who are not literate or who have become incapable of reading due to mental illness \nhave nothing to occupy their minds on extended lockdown. \n149.  Plaintiffs’ Expert will testify that this lack of mental stimulation creates a substantial risk \nof serious harm for Plaintiff class members. \n150.  Additionally, prisoners housed in the N2, N3, or N4 buildings are permitted very limited \naccess to the canteen/commissary. \n151.  Testimony and master prison records will show that many people are on yard restriction \nfor months or years on end. \n24 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 509   Filed 12/30/21   Page 25 of 43 PageID #: \n24226\n152.  Testimony will show that staff barter additional food in exchange for people waiving their \nshower time, do not wake people who are sleeping for their showers, or simply ignore people and \nrecord the shower as having been waived. \n153.  Interactions between individuals on the tiers are forbidden by the written policy of DWCC, \nand they may receive a disciplinary write-up for attempting to communicate with one another. \n154.  The culmination of these policies and the method of implementation means that people on \nextended lockdown, especially those in solitary confinement, are allowed very little human \ncontact. \n155.  According to prison records, most of the individuals serving disciplinary time on the \nlockdown units have been diagnosed with one or more mental illnesses. \n156.  The testimony will show that due to the lack of human contact and uncontrolled mental \nillness, many individuals will scream, laugh, and talk to themselves. Others rock in place or \ndeteriorate to more severe manifestations of their conditions, such as smearing blood or feces. \n157.  Plaintiffs’ experts will testify that individuals who suffer a major psychiatric episode \nfrequently lose the ability to take care of themselves for the duration of such an episode. \n158.  When a person in extended lockdown is unable to care for himself, he may go weeks or \nmonths without a shower. \n159.  According  to  the  anticipated  testimony  of  Plaintiffs’  experts,  the  extreme  isolation, \ndeprivation of stimuli, severe punishments, and acts of torture all work to create a significant risk \nof harm to the mental health of the people housed at DWCC. \n160.  Plaintiffs’ experts will ultimately testify that the conditions of confinement at DWCC can \ncause mental illness. The conditions of solitary confinement and extended lockdown at DWCC are \n25 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 509   Filed 12/30/21   Page 26 of 43 PageID #: \n24227\nnot merely abusive or psychologically painful, they cause the onset or major deterioration of \nPlaintiffs’ mental illnesses. \nII.  DEFENDANTS HAVE SUBJECTIVE KNOWLEDGE OF THEIR POLICIES \nAND PRACTICES, THEIR DEFICIENCIES, AND THE SERIOUS RISK OF \nHARM  \n \n161.  The Defendants’ own documents and anticipated testimony will demonstrate Defendants’ \nknowledge of the risk of harm. \n162.  The obviousness of the risks involved in keeping people with mental illness confined in \nextreme and austere conditions is also evidence of Defendants’ subjective knowledge. “[A] \nfactfinder may conclude that a prison official knew of a substantial risk from the very fact that the \nrisk was obvious.” Farmer, 511 U.S. at 842. \n163.  The testimony will show that the DPS&C approved the use on Policy 34 on people confined \nat DWCC.  \n164.  The testimony and documentary evidence will show that there is a culture of cover-up and \nexcessive force at David Wade, including excessive use of chemical agents and force on people \nwith serious mental illness. \n165.  The evidence will show that Defendants do not require or make adequate reporting and do \nnot enforce disciplinary policies; from the highest levels of the Department down to the prison unit \nlevel, there is a culture of no accountability.  \n166.  In sum, this culture is established and tolerated by each of the named Defendants to this \nlitigation. \n167.  The testimony and evidence will show that people reporting serious mental illness for \nthemselves or others are threatened and receive serious disciplinary punishment, including Policy \n34 and isolation. \n26 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 509   Filed 12/30/21   Page 27 of 43 PageID #: \n24228\n168.  Testimony will show Defendants have warned several class members that their continued \nparticipation in the investigation of mental health conditions at DWCC would lead to retaliation. \nSee also, First Amendment claim, below.  \n169.  The testimony will show that Defendants have offered promises of putting in a “good \nword” toward a transfer to another facility in exchange for individual cooperation to cease \nparticipating in the investigation. See also, First Amendment claim, below. \n170.  The record clearly shows that two individuals have chosen to withdraw as Plaintiffs in this \nlitigation. See also, First Amendment claim, below. \nIII.  DEFENDANTS  VIOLATE  THE  AMERICANS  WITH  DISABILITIES  ACT \nAND SECTION 504 OF THE REHABILITATION ACT. \n \n171.  Defendants violate the ADA and RA in the following ways: (1) DWCC fails in its \naffirmative duty to identify people with disabilities; (2) where DWCC does identify a person with \na disability, DWCC does not make any reasonable modifications or accommodations for people \nwith mental illness; (3) DWCC fails to track and act upon requests for reasonable accommodation \nmade  by  people  held  on  extended  lockdown;  (4)  DWCC  fails  to  make  any  reasonable \naccommodations to the disciplinary or use of force practices as they are applied to people with \ndisabilities. \nA.  DWCC fails in the affirmative duty to identify people with disabilities. \n \n172.  DWCC has an affirmative duty to identify people with disabilities. “The term ‘disability’ \nmeans, with respect to an individual (A) a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits \none or more major life activities of such individual; (B) a record of such an impairment; or (C) \nbeing regarded as having such an impairment.” 42 U.S.C.A. § 12102. \n173.  The analysis of whether an impairment substantially limits one or more major life activities \nnecessarily requires an assessment of that individual’s level of functioning. \n27 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 509   Filed 12/30/21   Page 28 of 43 PageID #: \n24229\n174.  “The  ADA  seeks  to  prevent  not  only  intentional  discrimination  against  people  with \ndisabilities but also – indeed primarily – discrimination that results from ‘thoughtlessness and \nindifference,’ that is, from ‘benign neglect.’” Brooklyn Cntr for Independence of the Disabled v. \nBloomberg, 980F. Supp.2d 588, 640 (S.D.N.Y. 2013) (quoting, H.R.Rep. No. 101–485(II), at 29 \n(1990)). \n175.  “[P]rison officials have an affirmative duty to assess the potential accommodation needs \nof inmates with known disabilities who are taken into custody and to provide the accommodations \nthat are necessary for those inmates to access the prison’s programs and services, without regard \nto whether or not the disabled individual has made a specific request for accommodation and \nwithout relying solely on the assumptions of prison officials regarding that individual’s needs.” \nPierce v. District of Columbia, 128 F.Supp.3d 250, 272 (D.D.C. 2015). \n176.  DWCC violates this affirmative duty in two ways: first, through an under-inclusive \ndefinition of disability and, second, by failing to identify and track people with chronic mental \nhealth disabilities. \ni)  Defendants’ definition of disability is under-inclusive. \n \n177.  The ADA defines disability on the basis of functional impairment, not stereotypes based \non diagnosis. Pierce, 128 F.Supp.3d at 272. \n178.  The documentary evidence will show that DPSC tracks people with mental illness based \nonly on its internal level of care system and an internal definition of “serious mental illness” or \n“SMI,” which is based solely on diagnosis rather than functional impairment. \n179.  Per  DPS&C  policy,  the  six  enumerated  conditions  are:  major  depressive  disorder, \nschizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, bipolar disorder, unspecified schizophrenia spectrum, and \nsevere anxiety disorder. \n28 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 509   Filed 12/30/21   Page 29 of 43 PageID #: \n24230\n180.  Plaintiffs’ experts will testify that by limiting the definition of SMI to only a list of six \nspecific diagnoses and failing to independently track disability, Defendants under-identify people \nwith disabilities by excluding people with mental illness whose symptoms cause a functional \nimpairment but whose diagnosis is not included on the limited list of six SMI diagnoses. \n181.  The Defendants have enshrined this under-inclusive definition in Department of Public \nSafety  and  Corrections  policy,  including  the  restrictive  housing  classification  program \nimplemented as of March 2020.  \nii)  Defendants fail to identify and track people with chronic mental health disabilities. \n \n182.  “An impairment that is episodic or in remission is a disability if it would substantially limit \na major life activity when active.” 42 U.S.C.A. § 12102(4)(D) (West). \n183.  “The determination of whether an impairment substantially limits a major life activity shall \nbe made without regard to the ameliorative effects of mitigating measures.” 42 U.S.C.A. § \n12102(4)(E)(i). \n184.  Mitigating  measures  include  “medication”  and  “learned  behavioral  or  adaptive \nneurological modifications.” 42 U.S.C.A. § 12102(4)(E)(i); Kemp v. Holder, 610 F.3d 231, 236 \n(5th Cir. 2010). \n185.   Defendants remove the SMI tag from the mental health files for individuals who enter \ntemporary remission in their mental illness according to testimony and documentary evidence. \n186.  Expert testimony will show that it is the consensus of the ACA, National Commission on \nCorrectional Healthcare, and American Psychiatric Association that people with mental health \nconditions, even in remission, should still be tracked and not be placed into restrictive housing, \neven while in remission.  \n29 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 509   Filed 12/30/21   Page 30 of 43 PageID #: \n24231\nB.  Defendants provide no affirmative modifications for people identified as having \nserious mental illness. \n \n187.  The documentary evidence and testimony will show that prisoners who are documented as \nhaving SMI are subject to the same harmful conditions of confinement as every other prisoner on \nextended lockdown at DWCC. \n188.  The three elements of this prima facie case are that (1) individuals with disabilities (2) who \nare qualified participants in a program or service (3) are denied access to that program or service \nby virtue of their disability. \n189.  Testimony and records will show that individuals with a mental health disability often have \nspecific, disability related needs and vulnerabilities.   \n190.  Defendants fail to provide reasonable accommodations due to DWCC’s failure to provide \ntreatment and a setting appropriate to the needs of the individual according to testimony and \ndocumentary evidence. \ni)  DWCC houses people known to have mental health disabilities. \n \n191.  The ADA does not permit an institution to ignore the open and obvious needs of a person \nwith a disability simply because they have not requested a reasonable accommodation. Pierce, 128 \nF.Supp.3d at 272. \n192.  The documentary evidence and testimony will show that even the people who Defendants \nidentify as having SMI receive no reasonable modifications to the conditions at DWCC. \n193.  The evidence will show that people at DWCC have serious needs, the Department is aware \nof those needs, and yet DWCC fails to offer reasonable accommodations to people who are \nexperiencing psychotic episodes, suffering from dementia, or engaging in patterns of serious self-\nharm or suicide attempts. \n30 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 509   Filed 12/30/21   Page 31 of 43 PageID #: \n24232\nii)  Defendants fail to provide treatment and an appropriate setting at DWCC that are \navailable at defendants’ other facilities. \n \n194.  The prima facie case for disability discrimination requires that a person with a disability \nwho is otherwise qualified to participate in a program may not be denied participation in that \nprogram due to disability. \n195.  Under the ADA, “[p]ublic entities shall ensure that inmates or detainees with disabilities \nare housed in the most integrated setting appropriate to the needs of the individuals.” 28 C.F.R. § \n35.152(b)(2). \n196.  Testimony and documentary evidence will show that the DPS&C and practices at DWCC \nrender people with mental health disabilities on extended lockdown unable to access needed \nmental health care for which they are qualified recipients. \n197.  The documentary evidence and testimony will show that services such as psychotherapy \nor other programming which provides the higher level of care necessary for individuals who are \nclassified as maximum security with a mental health disability are unavailable at DWCC. That \ncare is reasonable, practical, and available at other DPS&C institutions, such as EHCC. \n198.  Because patients who are classified as maximum security may access that mental health \ncare at EHCC, those patients are qualified participants in an existing DPS&C program. Testimony \nand documentary evidence will show that DWCC’s refusal to allow individuals with disabilities \naccess to that needed level of mental health care is discriminatory. \niii) DWCC discriminates against people with disabilities by restricting access to \nnecessary care in an appropriate setting based on disability. \n \n31 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 509   Filed 12/30/21   Page 32 of 43 PageID #: \n24233\n199.  DWCC itself not only bars maximum-custody people from most treatment, but also \ndiscriminates on the basis of disability when deciding whether to send a person to a different prison \nwhere treatment is available according to testimony and documentary evidence. \n200.  It is anticipated that Dr. Seal will testify that he rarely recommends people for transfer out \nof DWCC, and then only if they meet his specific criteria. \n201.  This testimony will show that the very narrow and specific set of criteria followed by Dr. \nSeal prevents people with disabilities, even those who have been identified as having SMI by the \nDefendants, from being able to access the care they need while in a maximum-security setting. \n202.  The evidence will show that a decision to transfer individuals to EHCC is not driven by \nany  specific  mental  health  needs,  or  individualized  evaluation  of  security  concerns.  This \ninconsistent practice deprives people with disabilities of access to care without and adequately \nindividualized assessment of the person’s needs. \n203.  Plaintiffs’ experts will testify that in addition to failing to provide needed care, Defendants \nexpose people with disabilities to unique risks by keeping them in restrictive housing indefinitely. \n204.  The evidence will show that Defendants fail to limit the duration of confinement on \nextended lockdown for individuals who have been documented as having SMI, or people with \nfunctional impairment. \n205.  Plaintiffs’ experts will testify at length regarding the dangers of this practice.  \n206.  Dr. Haney’s testimony is expected to mirror his expert declaration which documents the \nextensive literature and scientific support for the proposition that extended lockdown is uniquely \nharmful for people with pre-existing mental illness.  \n32 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 509   Filed 12/30/21   Page 33 of 43 PageID #: \n24234\n207.  Plaintiffs experts will testify that the highly restrictive environment on extended lockdown \nat DWCC prevents people with mental illness from being able to access needed care and exposes \npeople with mental illness to significant dangers. \n208.  Plaintiffs’ experts will testify that those dangers are manifested as repeated acts of serious \nself-harm, suicide attempts, mental deterioration, and serious behavioral problems. \nC.  DWCC fails to provide a process for requesting reasonable accommodations. \n \n209.  “[E]mploying no system or an inadequate system for prisoners to request accommodations \nand submit grievances regarding non-accommodation” is an unlawful method of administration \nunder the ADA. Dunn v. Dunn, 318 F.R.D. 652, 665 (M.D. Ala. 2016), modified sub nom. Braggs \nv. Dunn, No. 2:14CV601-MHT, 2020 WL 2395987 (M.D. Ala. May 12, 2020). \n210.  Public  entities  are  required  to  maintain  a  process  for  requesting  reasonable \naccommodations. 28 C.F.R. § 35.163; see also 28 C.F.R. § 35.106. \n211.  The failure to track these requests for reasonable accommodations, and failure to train, \nsupervise, and set policies for their staff to track requests for reasonable accommodation, has had \nthe “effect of defeating or substantially impairing accomplishment of the objectives of the public \nentity's program with respect to individuals with disabilities.” 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(3)(ii). \n212.  Testimony from DWCC employees is expected to show that DWCC has not received a \nrequest for a reasonable accommodation related to mental illness for a prisoner on extended \nlockdown in the past five years.  \n213.  The  documentary  evidence  will  show  that  Defendants  received  several  requests  for \nreasonable accommodations related to mental illness in the relevant period of this lawsuit, \nincluding formal ARPs. \n33 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 509   Filed 12/30/21   Page 34 of 43 PageID #: \n24235\n214.  Testimony is expected to show a lack of knowledge regarding a process for people to \nrequest reasonable accommodations. \nD. DWCC applies brutal discipline against people with mental illness for behaviors \nrelated to their disability. \n \n215.  The obligation to provide accommodations also applies to the discipline of disabled \nprisoners: “A failure to provide a reasonable accommodation can occur where a correctional \nofficer could have used less force or no force during the performance of his or her penological \nduties with respect to a disabled person. A failure to provide a reasonable accommodation, or \ndiscrimination by reason of disability, constitutes a violation of the ADA[.]’” Lewis v. Cain, No. \n3:15-CV-318, 2021 WL 1219988, at *55 (M.D. La. Mar. 31, 2021). \n216.  “When applied in the prison context, it follows that the second element of a § 12132 claim \ncan be satisfied where a correctional officer could have used less force or no force during the \nperformance of his or her penological duties with respect to a disabled person.” Id. citing \nArmstrong v. Newsom, No. 94-cv-02307 CW, 2021 WL 933106, at *3 (N.D. Cal. Mar. 11, 2021). \n217.  The  court  in  Lewis  found  that  the  “hands  off  approach  to  discipline”  by  the  ADA \ncoordinator and medical staff at LSP violated the ADA. Id.  \n218.  The documentary evidence and testimony are expected to show that Defendants frequently \nemploy force which is inappropriate to the circumstances, especially in situations involving \nprisoners with mental illness. \n219.  The documentary evidence and testimony are expected to show that the use of mace on \npeople who are making noise is endemic. DWCC and the Department both maintain regulations \nwith the goal of preventing the overuse of force on people with mental illness, but those policies \nare no practical barrier to the use of force at DWCC. \n34 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 509   Filed 12/30/21   Page 35 of 43 PageID #: \n24236\n220.  Testimony is expected to show that Defendants maintain a pattern and practice of using \nunrestricted force even where there are objective indicators that a person is in need of mental health \nassistance, such as a direct request for mental health, being on suicide watch, or responding to \nhallucinatory stimuli. \n221.  Plaintiffs’ expert Sec. Dan Pacholke will testify that in addition to the brutal use of force, \nDWCC also employs counterproductive sanctions against people with disabilities. \n222.  Dr. Haney will testify as to the role of forced idleness, social isolation, and sensory \ndeprivation in worsening mental health symptoms for people in solitary confinement. \nIV.  DEFENDANTS’ CONDUCT VIOLATES THE FIRST AMENDMENT TO THE \nCONSTITUTION.  \n \n223.  It  is  long  established  that  prisoners  have  a  right  to  unobstructed  and  confidential \ncommunication with courts and attorneys. Ex parte Hull, 312 U.S. 546, 549 (1941).  \n224.  Unfettered communication between lawyers and their clients is indispensable to the fair \noperation of our system of justice.  \nA.   Protecting the sanctity of legal mail is of particular significance in this case. \n \n225.  Undersigned counsel were retained to challenge the conditions of confinement at David \nWade Correctional Center.  \n226.  David Wade is a maximum-security prison located in a very rural part of Louisiana, \nphysically situated in a national forest.  \n227.  All parties and physical evidence in this proceeding are within the exclusive control of the \nDefendants.  \n228.  Because of the remote location of David Wade, attorneys wishing to communicate with \nmen housed there largely rely upon written legal correspondence.   \n35 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 509   Filed 12/30/21   Page 36 of 43 PageID #: \n24237\n229.  Although opening and reading any attorney’s mail is a serious constitutional problem, the \nunique facts of this case raise a particularly odious specter of interference with the conduct of the \nlitigation.  Evidence  will  show  Defendant  prison  administrators  surveilled  Plaintiff  prisoner \ncorrespondence with counsel engaged to sue the prison, for ongoing conditions at the prison.  \n230.  Prison litigation is unique in that the plaintiffs are in a uniquely vulnerable position vis a \nvis the defendants. Defendant prison administrators control every aspect of Plaintiffs’ lives: \nwhether they eat, how much they eat, whether they shower, whether they are allowed outside, what \ntemperatures they are held in, whether they have access to reading material, whether they receive \nmedication, whether they sleep and every other basic human need. \n231.  If prisoners know their correspondence with counsel about prison conditions is being \nmonitored or read:  \na.  It  deters  many  prisoners  from  writing  to  counsel  at  all,  for  fear  that  in \ncommunicating with Class counsel they will be less favored, manifesting as fewer \nprivileges or more punishment.  \nb.  It forces writers to self-censor or limit disclosures, also for fear of retaliation.  \nc.  It allows the named Defendants in the proceeding to know which class members \nare communicating with counsel, when, and about what.  \n232.  Defendants have the ability to exert all manner of influence—directly and indirectly—over \nthose members of the class.   \n233.  The Court does not need an expert witness to understand the risk inherent in these facts. \nThe potential for complete disruption of the attorney-client relationship is common sense and self-\nevident.  \n36 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 509   Filed 12/30/21   Page 37 of 43 PageID #: \n24238\n234.  The identities of the parties and subject matter of this case militate toward a most rigorous \nscrutiny of interference with legal mail.   \n235.  The interference with legal mail made conduct of this litigation extraordinarily onerous. It \nresulted  in  multiple  class  members  being  intimidated  into  withdrawal  from  the  litigation, \nexponentially compounding the burden on class members, counsel, and the Court.   \nB.  The First Amendment legal framework.  \n \n236.  Prisoners have a right of privacy in their legal communications. This right applies to prison \nvisits, telephone calls, and mail by counsel.    \n237.  “Privileged” mail is entitled to greater confidentiality and freedom from censorship than \ngeneral correspondence.  \n238.  Privileged mail may not be read in the ordinary course of a prison’s routine or practice, \nexcept in the case of an emergency. Reneer v. Sewell, 975 F.2d 258, 260 (6th Cir. 1992); Lemon \nv. Dugger, 931 F.2d 1465, 1467–68 (11th Cir. 1991); Proudfoot v. Williams, 803 F.Supp. 1048, \n1052 (E.D.Pa. 1992); U.S. v. DeFonte, 441 F.3d 92, 95–96 (2d Cir. 2006).  Instead, prison officials \nmust obtain a warrant to conduct such act. Burton v. Foltz, 599 F.Supp. 114, 117 (E.D.Mich. 1984). \n239.  Most courts have held that privileged legal correspondence may not be opened by prison \nofficials  outside  the  prisoner’s  presence.  Wolff  v.  McDonnell,  418  U.S.  539,  577  (1974); \nMerriweather v. Zamora, 569 F.3d 307, 316–17 (6th Cir. 2009); Mitchell v. Peoples, 10 F.4th \n1226,  1230–31 (11th Cir. 2021); Sallier v. Brooks, 343 F.3d 868, 874 (6th Cir. 2003); Davis v. \nGoord, 320 F.3d 346, 351 (2d Cir. 2003); Royse v. Superior Court of State of Washington, 779 \nF.2d 573, 574–75 (9th Cir. 1985); Hinderliter v. Hungerford, 814 F. Supp. 66, 68 (D.Kan. 1993); \nYoung v. Keohane, 809 F.Supp. 1185, 1197 (M.D.Pa. 1992); Burt v. Carlson, 752 F. Supp. 346, \n348  (C.D.Cal.  1990);  Faulkner  v.  McLocklin,  727  F.  Supp.  486,  489–92  (N.D.Ind.  1989); \n37 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 509   Filed 12/30/21   Page 38 of 43 PageID #: \n24239\nMcChriston v. Duckworth, 610 F. Supp. 791, 795–96 (N.D.Ind. 1985); Guyer v. Beard, 907 F.2d \n1424, 1428–29 (3d Cir. 1990); Stone-El v. Fairman, 785 F. Supp. 711, 715 (N.D.Ill. 1991). \n240.  The interference with or invasion of privacy of legal mail potentially violates two rights – \na prisoner’s First Amendment right to free speech and the right of access to the courts. Brewer v. \nWilkinson, 3 F.3d 816, 825 (5th Cir. 1993).  \n241.  Plaintiffs herein do not bring an access-to-courts claim, because Plaintiffs were ultimately \nable to pursue this litigation; Defendants actions created significant burden and delay, but did not \nultimately thwart litigation.   \n242.  Rather, Plaintiffs bring a First Amendment claim based upon the right to communicate \nwith lawyers.  Denius v. Dunlap, 209 F.3d 944, 954 (7th Cir. 2000); Williams v. Price, 25 F. Supp. \n2d 623, 629 – 30 (W.D.Pa. 1998).  \n243.   “Protection  of  an  inmate’s  freedom  to  engage  in  protected  communications  is  a \nconstitutional end in itself.” Mitchell, 10 F.4th at 1230; quoting Wilson v. Blankenship, 163 F.3d \n1284, 1290–91 (11th Cir. 1998).   \n244.  A free speech claim upholds the right to be free from unjustified governmental interference \nwith communication. Brewer, 3 F.3d at 820.  \n245.  Both the Supreme Court and the Fifth Circuit have recognized this right. “Prisoners retain \nfree speech rights consistent ‘with the legitimate penological objectives of the corrections system,’ \nand restrictions on those rights cannot be greater than necessary to protect the correctional interests \ninvolved.” Every v. Jindal, 413 Fed.Appx. 725, 727 (5th Cir. 2011); quoting Brewer, 3 F.3d at \n821–22.  \nC.  Defendants systematically interfered with mail sent by prisoners to their counsel in \nviolation of the First Amendment to the Constitution. (Outgoing Mail). \n \n38 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 509   Filed 12/30/21   Page 39 of 43 PageID #: \n24240\n246.  Outgoing privileged mail may generally be sent unopened. Davidson v. Scully, 694 F.2d \n50, 53 (2d Cir. 1982); Smith v. Shimp, 562 F.2d 423, 424 (7th Cir. 1977); Mawby v. Ambroyer, \n568 F.Supp. 245, 249–50 (E.D.Mich. 1983); Witherow v. Paff, 52 F.3d 264, 265–66 (7th Cir. \n1995); Royse, 779 F.2d at 574–75. \n247.  A prisoner has a right to be free from unlawful interference with his mail, including \noutgoing legal mail. Every, 413 Fed.Appx. at 726.  \n248.  Documentary evidence and testimony will show that Defendants interfered with that right \nby opening Plaintiffs’ outgoing legal mail to counsel.  \n249.  Staff at DWCC are expected to testify to the mail handling and security procedures in place \nat DWCC, which evidence a violation of Plaintiffs’ rights.  \n250.  Through testimony of Plaintiffs’ witnesses and exhibits, Plaintiffs also will show that some \noutgoing legal mail was received at Disability Rights Louisiana only after having been previously \nopened, or was not received by Disability Rights Louisiana at all.  \n251.  Unlike incoming mail, outgoing mail from prisoners does not pose a threat to prison order \nand security. In fact, the Court acknowledged that “the implications of outgoing correspondence \nfor prison security are of a categorically lesser magnitude than the implications of incoming \nmaterials.” Thornburgh v. Abbott, 490 U.S. 401, 411–13 (1989).  \n252.  Defendant’s opening of outgoing legal mail is subjected to heightened legal scrutiny.  \n253.  To hold otherwise would threaten lawyers’ ability to competently represent people who are \nincarcerated.    \n254.  Plaintiffs will show through the DWCC and DPS&C mail handling policies that there is \nno substantial or legitimate penological or government interest served by opening outgoing legal \nmail.  \n39 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 509   Filed 12/30/21   Page 40 of 43 PageID #: \n24241\n255.  There is no substantial or legitimate penological or government interest served by opening \nclearly marked mail addressed to the office of lawyers that prison officials know to be suing them.  \n256.  If any government interest does exist, Defendants’ opening of Plaintiffs’ legal mail clearly \naddressed to counsel does not further any such interest.     \nD. Defendants interfered with Plaintiffs’ First Amendment rights by systematically \ncensoring mail sent by attorneys to prisoners at DWCC. (Incoming Mail). \n \n257.  Prison officials may not censor clearly-marked legal mail. Wolff, 418 U.S. at 574–77. \n258.  Censorship’s effect on free speech “need not be great in order to be actionable.” Keenan v. \nTejeda, 290 F.3d 252, 259 (5th Cir. 2002).  \n259.  It is established that such censorship “sufficiently chills, inhibits, or interferes with [the \ninmate’s] ability to speak, protest, and complain openly to his attorney so as to infringe his right \nto free speech.” Mitchell, 10 F.4th at 1241.  \n260.  “When a prisoner receives confidential legal mail that has been opened and re-sealed, he \nmay understandably be wary of engaging in future communication about privileged matters.” \nHayes v. Idaho Correctional Center, 849 F.3d 1204, 1213 (9th Cir. 2017). \n261.  Documentary evidence and testimony will show that Defendants in this matter have clearly \ninterfered with prisoners’ incoming legal mail at DWCC.  \n262.  Defendant’s opening of incoming legal mail is subjected to heightened legal scrutiny.  \n263.  To hold otherwise would threaten lawyers’ ability to competently represent people who are \nincarcerated.    \n264.  There is no substantial or legitimate penological or government interest served by opening \nincoming  legal  mail  outside  of  the  presence  of  the  recipient.  The  Court’s  own  reasoning, \njurisprudence, and both DWCC and DPS&C policies will confirm this principle.  \n40 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 509   Filed 12/30/21   Page 41 of 43 PageID #: \n24242\n265.  Such  evidence  will  also  show  there  is  no  substantial  or  legitimate  penological  or \ngovernment interest served by opening clearly marked mail addressed from the office of lawyers \nthat prison officials know to be suing them, much less doing so outside of the presence of the \nintended recipient.  \n266.  If any government interest does exist, Defendants’ opening of counsel’s legal mail clearly \naddressed to Class members does not further any such interest.     \n267.  Established legitimate penological interests include “security, good order, or discipline of \nthe institution.” Thornburgh, 490 U.S. at 416.  \n268.  While inspecting incoming mail for safety reasons—such as checking for contraband—is \na valid penological interest, DWCC’s practice of opening legal mail from attorneys suing the \nprison about ongoing conditions and outside of the presence of the recipient violates prisoners’ \nFirst Amendment rights.   \n269.  Any  regulation  restricting  prisoner’s  First  Amendment  rights  must  be  neutral  in  its \nenforcement, not discriminatory to the content of the expression. Turner v. Safley, 482 U.S. 78, 90 \n(1987); citing Pell v. Procunier, 417 U.S. 817, 828 (1974). \n270.  Because of who the parties to the mail at issue are, the nature of these proceedings, the \ntestimony from Plaintiffs and the fact that Defendants were acting in violation of their own mail \npolicies in opening both outgoing and incoming mail, this Court can surmise that Plaintiffs’ mail \nwas targeted for surveillance because of the content of their speech and involvement in this \nlitigation.  \n271.  Such a selection based upon the content of their First Amendment activity triggers strict \nscrutiny analysis.  Defendants cannot pass strict scrutiny analysis on these facts.  \n41 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 509   Filed 12/30/21   Page 42 of 43 PageID #: \n24243\n272.  Plaintiffs and staff of the named Defendants are expected to testify that without access to \nprivileged legal mail, Plaintiffs had no alternative avenues for confidentially communicating with \ncounsel. \n273.  When prisons restrict expression through a valid and justified speech restriction (which \nPlaintiffs’ dispute is present here), they must retain other avenues for prisoner expression. Jones \nv. North Carolina Prisoners’ Union, 433 U.S. 119, 131 (1977), Turner, 482 U.S. at 89. No such \navenues at DWCC exist.    \nE.  Defendants otherwise attempted to interfere with communication with counsel. \n \n274.  Plaintiffs also plan to enter into evidence testimony and exhibits to show prisoners were \npunished for bringing documents to attorney-client visits.  \n275.  Staff seized counsel’s contact information from Plaintiffs and otherwise interfered with \nand refused counsel the ability to provide written materials to prisoners in violation of the First \nAmendment of the Constitution. This will be demonstrated through Plaintiff testimony, \nDefendant’s testimony, as well as documentary evidence.  \n \nRespectfully submitted this 30th day of December, 2021.  \n \nCOUNSEL FOR PLAINTIFFS: \n \n/s/ Emma Lee Douglas________ \nMelanie Bray, La.

Conclusion ........................................................................................................................ 163 \n \nI.  Introduction \nThis class action suit for injunctive and declaratory relief, filed by inmates at David \nWade  Correctional  Center  (“DWCC”),  challenges  the  conditions  of  confinement  for \ninmates on extended lockdown at DWCC, the mental health care provided to inmates on \nextended  lockdown,  DWCC’s  treatment  of  inmates  with  mental  illness  on  extended \nlockdown,  and  the  opening  and  reading  of  prisoner  legal  mail.  Plaintiffs  allege  that \nmultiple  policies  and  practices  in  place  at  DWCC  violate  the  First  and  Eighth \nAmendments to the United States Constitution,1 Title II of the Americans with Disabilities \nAct (“ADA”),2 and section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (“RA”).3 \nThis matter came before the Court for a seventeen-day bench trial from January 10, \n2022,  to  February  3,  2022.4  In  total,  the  Court  heard  testimony  from  thirty-eight \nwitnesses5—including correction officials and staff, inmates, and expert witnesses—who \ntestified about the conditions on extended lockdown at DWCC. After the trial, the Court \n \n1 The First Amendment and Eighth Amendment claims are brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \n§ 1983. Section 1983 provides a federal cause of action for “the deprivation of any rights, \nprivileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws” of the United States \nagainst any person acting under color of state law. 42 U.S.C. § 1983. Qualified immunity \nis not at issue in this case because Plaintiffs only seek prospective equitable relief—i.e., \ninjunctive and declaratory relief and not monetary relief—and because Plaintiffs have \nsued Defendants only in their official capacities. Singleton v. Cannizzaro, 956 F.3d 773, \n778 n.3 (5th Cir. 2020).  \n2 42 U.S.C. § 12131, et seq.  \n3 29 U.S.C. § 794.  \n4 Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the trial was held by Zoom video conference.  \n5 This number includes deposition testimony and stipulated testimony.  \n3 \n   \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 641   Filed 11/01/22   Page 4 of 165 PageID #: \n35230\npermitted the parties to submit simultaneous post-trial briefs after which the Court took \nthe matter under advisement.  \nFor the reasons below, after considering the stipulations of the parties, the credible \ntestimony and evidence at trial, and the pre- and post-trial briefs, the Court finds that \nPlaintiffs  have  failed  to  carry  their  burden  of  proving  that  Defendants  have  been \ninterfering with or censoring the legal mail coming in and out of DWCC or otherwise \nretaliating against inmates for exercising their free speech rights in violation of the First \nAmendment.  However,  the  Court  finds  that  Plaintiffs  have  satisfied  their  burden  of \nproving by a preponderance of the evidence 1) that Defendants6 have been deliberately \nindifferent by a) housing inmates, including the mentally ill, in inhumane conditions while \non extended lockdown and b) failing to provide those inmates adequate mental health care \nin violation of the Eighth Amendment and 2) that Defendants have been violating the \n \n6 The Court has not parsed out liability to individual Defendants as to each cause of action \nfor which the Court has found liability. This is for several reasons. First, Plaintiffs’ briefs \ndo  not  discuss  individual  liability.  See  generally  Record  Document  316.  Nor  do \nDefendants argue that the Court should so parse liability. Additionally, the Court notes \nthat all individual Defendants are sued in their official capacities and that injunctive relief \nis the only type of relief sought; thus, individual liability is not significant. Lastly, the \ncauses of action on which Plaintiffs have prevailed are for the collective failings of a \nsystem to which all Defendants contributed to some degree. The Court’s decision to not \nparse out liability to individual Defendants is also keeping in practice with other district \ncourts that have addressed similar issues. See, e.g., See Lewis v. Cain, No. 3:15-CV-318, \n2021 WL 1219988 (M.D. La. Mar. 31, 2021); Braggs v. Dunn, 257 F. Supp. 3d 1171, \n1180 (M.D. Ala. 2017); Ruiz v. Estelle, 503 F. Supp. 1265, 1339 (S.D. Tex. 1980). The \nCourt does note that the Louisiana Department of Public Safety and Corrections is named \nonly as to the ADA and RA claims. Record Document 316 at ¶ 17. Therefore, the liability \nof that Defendant is limited to the ADA and RA claims for which the Court has found \nliability. Additionally, Colonel Lonnie Nail was terminated as a Defendant in this matter \nand Colonel Vincent Coleman was substituted in his place, in his official capacity. See \nRecord Document 532 at 2. \n4 \n   \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 641   Filed 11/01/22   Page 5 of 165 PageID #: \n35231\nADA and RA by a) failing to make reasonable accommodations for inmates with mental \ndisabilities and b) employing unlawful methods of administration.  \nII.  Procedural Background \nPlaintiffs  in  this  action  are  an  advocacy  center,  Disability  Rights  Louisiana \n(“Disability  Rights”)  f/k/a  Advocacy  Center  of  Louisiana,  and  several  inmate \nrepresentatives who were housed in extended lockdown at DWCC at the time suit was \nfiled (collectively, “Plaintiffs”).  See Record Document 316. These  inmates are  Bruce \nCharles,  Carlton  Turner,  Larry  Jones,  and  Ronald  Brooks  (collectively,  the  “Named \nPlaintiffs”).7 See id.  \nIn  February  2018,  Plaintiffs  filed  suit  against  James  LeBlanc,  in  his  official \ncapacity as the Secretary of the Louisiana Department of Public Safety and Corrections; \nJerry Goodwin, in his official capacity as the Warden of DWCC; Lonnie Nail, in his \nofficial capacity as the Colonel overseeing the South Compound at DWCC;8 Gregory \nSeal, M.D., in his official capacity as the contract psychiatrist at DWCC; Deborah Dauzat, \nin her official capacity as the Deputy Warden at DWCC; Steve Hayden, in his official \ncapacity as a Corrections Program Manager at DWCC; Aerial Robinson, in her official \ncapacity as a Social Services Counselor at DWCC; Johnie Adkins, in his official capacity \n \n7 Anthony Tellis was a Plaintiff at the outset of litigation, but he has since withdrawn from \nthe  case.  See  Record  Documents  1,  174.  At  one  point,  Plaintiffs  also  sought  to  add \nDamonte Henry as a Named Plaintiff, but he requested to withdraw before the Court \nconsidered the merits of the request to add him. See Record Documents 196, 197.  \n8 During the course of this litigation, multiple people served as the Unit Manager over the \nSouth Compound. Vincent Coleman is the current Colonel over the South Compound and \ntherefore has been substituted in Colonel Nail’s place, in his official capacity. See Record \nDocument 532 at 2.   \n5 \n   \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 641   Filed 11/01/22   Page 6 of 165 PageID #: \n35232\nas a Social Services Counselor at DWCC; and the Louisiana Department of Public Safety \nand Corrections9 (collectively, “Defendants”). Plaintiffs seek a declaration that Defendants \nare violating the Eighth Amendment, First Amendment, ADA, and RA and an injunction \nto cure the violations; Plaintiffs do not seek monetary relief.10 \nPreviously, the Court granted Plaintiffs’ motion for class certification and certified \na class of all prisoners who are or will be subjected to extended lockdown at DWCC that \nwill pursue the First Amendment and Eighth Amendment claims (the “Class”) and a \nsubclass consisting of all individuals on extended lockdown at DWCC who have or are \nperceived as having a qualifying disability related to mental health, as defined within the \nADA, that will pursue the ADA and RA claims (the “Subclass”). Record Document 462. \nThe Class and the Subclass are represented by the Named Plaintiffs.11  \nBecause of the nature of this case, the Court bifurcated this matter into two phases: \na liability phase and a remedy phase. The Court held the aforementioned bench trial only \non the liability phase. The issues before the Court during the liability phase were whether, \nas of the discovery cutoff date of March 15, 2020, Defendants are violating the Class’s \nFirst Amendment and Eighth Amendment rights and the Subclass’s rights under the ADA \nand RA.12  \n \n9 As previously mentioned, the Louisiana Department of Public Safety and Corrections is \nnamed as a Defendant only as to the ADA and RA claims. Record Document 316 ¶ 17.  \n10 Plaintiffs do, however, seek attorney’s fees and litigation expenses pursuant to  42 \nU.S.C. § 1988 and other applicable law.   \n11 Bruce Charles and Larry Jones, however, did not testify at trial.  \n12 The Court exercised its discretion to limit the liability determination to the discovery \nperiod. At a motion hearing on August 26, 2021, the Court detailed its reasoning for \ndeclining to consider conditions after March 15, 2020. See Record Document 459; see \n6 \n   \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 641   Filed 11/01/22   Page 7 of 165 PageID #: \n35233\nAs stated above, the Court finds in favor of Plaintiffs in substantial part as to the \nEighth Amendment, ADA, and RA claims. These claims, as detailed below, will proceed \nto the remedy phase. The Court, however, finds in favor of Defendants as to Plaintiffs’ \nFirst Amendment claim; Defendants are entitled to dismissal of this claim. \n Pursuant to Rule 52(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the Court sets out \nits findings of fact and conclusions of law herein. If a fact was controverted, the Court \nweighed the evidence. \nIII.  Background Facts \nBefore turning to the specific claims, the Court will detail the relevant background \nfacts. First, the Court will define important terms that will appear throughout this opinion, \nsuch as restrictive housing and extended lockdown. Second, the Court will give a general \noverview of DWCC—more specifically, the South Compound at DWCC. Third, the Court \nwill provide an overview of restrictive housing at DWCC. Fourth, the Court will describe \nthe  level  of  care  system  utilized  by  the  Louisiana  Department  of  Public  Safety  and \nCorrections (the “DOC”). Fifth, the Court will introduce correctional officials and explain \ntheir role with the DOC or DWCC. Lastly, the Court will introduce the parties’ expert \nwitnesses upon whose expertise the Court relied in understanding correctional practices \nand scientific principles.   \n \nalso Record Document 378. In short, conditions after the discovery cutoff date would not \nbe probative  of liability. For one  thing, the discovery cutoff date coincided with  the \nonslaught of the Covid-19 virus in Louisiana. See Record Document 378 at 2. Temporary \nchanges in housing arrangements were made at the prison to help prevent the spread of the \nvirus, but said changes were irrelevant to this litigation. Additionally, evidence concerning \nconditions at DWCC in March 2020 was the most up-to-date information available to \nPlaintiffs. Changes after the discovery cutoff date will be considered at the remedy phase. \n7 \n   \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 641   Filed 11/01/22   Page 8 of 165 PageID #: \n35234\nA.  Restrictive Housing and Extended Lockdown Defined  \nPlacing  inmates  in  restrictive  housing  is  a  commonly  used  practice  in  prisons \nthroughout the country. Record Document 524 ¶ 73. The parties stipulate that restrictive \nhousing  refers  to  housing  prisoners  separately  from  the  general  population  of  a \ncorrectional  institution  and  imposing  restrictions  on  their  movement,  behavior,  and \nprivileges. Id. ¶ 21. Extended lockdown is a subset of restrictive housing. Id. Extended \nlockdown refers to housing prisoners separately from the general population for twenty-\ntwo or more hours per day in a cell. Id. ¶ 22.   \nThe terminology, however, is not consistent throughout the prison industry. Often, \nrestrictive housing, segregation, extended lockdown, and solitary confinement are used \ninterchangeably.  The  Court  will  generally  use  the  terms  consistent  with  the  parties’ \nstipulations and the experts’ use of the terminology. The Court treats solitary confinement \nas  a  synonym  for  extended  lockdown  and  segregation  as  a  synonym  for  restrictive \nhousing. \nB.  DWCC Overview  \nDWCC  is  a  maximum-security  prison  in  Claiborne  Parish,  Louisiana.  Record \nDocument  524  ¶  26.  As  of  the  discovery  cutoff  date,  DWCC  was  an  American \nCorrectional  Association  (“ACA”)  accredited  institution.  Burns  Trial  Tr.  vol.  VI  at \n1466:16-18 [Record Document 540]. It houses over 1,200 inmates in the custody of the \nDOC.13 The facility is divided into two compounds—the North Compound and the South \n \n13 The exact number was 1,207 as of March 2020. Ex. J-21 at 9 [Record Document 565-\n49]. \n8 \n   \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 641   Filed 11/01/22   Page 9 of 165 PageID #: \n35235\nCompound.  Record  Document  524  ¶  28.  The  South  Compound  houses  inmates  on \nextended lockdown, whereas the North Compound houses inmates in general population. \nSolomon Trial Tr. vol. III at 594:7-14 [Record Document 536]. The South Compound has \nfive buildings—N-1 through N-5, though only buildings N-1 through N-4 are at issue in \nthis case. Record Document 524 ¶ 28.  \nEach South Compound building has four linear tiers: A, B, C, and D; the tiers each \nhave sixteen cells.14 Id. ¶ 29. All cells on the South Compound generally hold two people, \nexcept for cells reserved for camera observations on each tier, N-2D, and all cells in the \nN-4 building, which usually are single-bunked cells. Id. ¶ 31-33. Of the sixteen cells on \neach tier in buildings N-2 through N-4, the first two cells are camera cells for prisoners \nwho are on suicide watch. Id. ¶ 30. There is a camera in each of those cells, as well as in \nall cells on the N-4C tier. Id. These cameras are live feed only; that is, they do not record. \nId. ¶ 44. There is a building lobby that contains the key room—the room in which the Key \nOfficer is stationed to monitor and control traffic in and out of each building and tier. \nGoodwin Trial Tr. vol. X at 2226:22-2228:4 [Record Document 544].  \nBuildings N-1 through N-4 were extended lockdown units at the outset of this \nlitigation. Burns Trial Tr. vol. V at 1256:4-6 [Record Document 539]. In January 2017, \nDWCC housed 344 inmates on extended lockdown. Ex. J-21 at 1 [Record Document 565-\n49]. During this litigation, DWCC began implementing changes to certain buildings and \ntiers on the South Compound, which resulted in a reduction of the number of inmates on \n \n14 The buildings are in the shape of an “H” with the legs and arms of the “H” being the \ntiers and the middle being the connecting lobby area.  \n9 \n   \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 641   Filed 11/01/22   Page 10 of 165 PageID #: \n35236\nextended lockdown. The Court will now detail the specific characteristics of the different \nbuildings and tiers as of March 2020. \n1.  N-2A, N-2B, N-2C, N-3, and N-4 \nTiers A, B, and C of building N-2 and every tier in buildings N-3 and N-4 (the \n“extended lockdown tiers”) house maximum custody inmates. Record Document 524 ¶ \n32. These inmates have been assigned to these units for disciplinary reasons or as an initial \nclassification  decision.  In  essence,  these  are  the  inmates  on  extended  lockdown.  The \nevidence established that inmates on the extended lockdown tiers spend twenty-three to \ntwenty-four hours per day in their cell. As of March 2020, DWCC housed 228 inmates on \nthe extended lockdown tiers.15 Ex. J-21 at 9 [Record Document 565-49]. \n2.  N-1 \nAt some point in 2018, DWCC converted building N-1 into a transitional unit. \nGoodwin Trial Tr. vol. XVIII at 4271:1-12 [Record Document 562]. In other words, \ninmates housed in N-1 are in the process of transitioning to general population on the \nNorth Compound or society outside the prison. It is also used as an overflow or backlog \nunit—that is, for inmates waiting for a bed to open on the North Compound. Id. Inmates in \nN-1 are classified as medium custody. Record Document 524 ¶ 34. As of March 2020, N-\n1 was at capacity with 128 inmates housed on the different tiers. Ex. J-21 at 9 [Record \nDocument 565-49]. Although N-1 is no longer used for disciplinary housing, as detailed \nbelow, it is still a restrictive housing setting.   \n \n15 The Court notes that this number fluctuated. For example, in January 2019, DWCC \nhoused 246 inmates on the extended lockdown tiers. Ex. J-21 at 6-8 [Record Document \n565-49]. \n10 \n   \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 641   Filed 11/01/22   Page 11 of 165 PageID #: \n35237\n3.  N-2D \nLike N-1, inmates housed in N-2D are not there for disciplinary reasons. Instead, \nN-2D houses inmates on closed cell restriction (“CCR”). Record Document 524 ¶ 33. At \nDWCC,  CCR  is  a  protective  custody  status.  Inmates,  however,  are  still  classified  as \nmaximum custody, Ex. J-3 at 8 [Record Document 564-285], and single bunked. Goodwin \nTrial  Tr.  vol.  XVIII  at  4213:24-4214:13  [Record  Document  562].  The  purpose  of \nprotective custody is to separate an inmate from other inmates for reasons of health or \nsafety; it is nonpunitive. Ex. J-3 at 8 [Record Document 564-285].  \nBy way of example, protective housing may be appropriate for an inmate because \nof his former profession, such as being a police officer. Id. Another example is an inmate \nwho cannot live in general population because he is a threat to institutional security based \non prior conduct but has shown improved conduct on extended lockdown and therefore \ndeserves  more  privileges.  Goodwin  Trial  Tr.  vol.  XVIII  at  4213:24-4214:13  [Record \nDocument 562].  \nPlaintiffs do not challenge DWCC’s use of protective custody. They do, however, \nchallenge the overall conditions on the South Compound and the policies in place for \ninmates held in a restrictive housing setting. And as the evidence demonstrated, inmates in \nN-2D remain in their cell for greater than twenty-two hours per day.  \nC.  Restrictive Housing at DWCC \nAt  DWCC,  extended  lockdown  is  primarily  used  to  house  inmates  who  have \ncommitted a rule infraction or who jeopardize the stability of the prison. Upchurch Trial \nTr.  vol.  XIV  at  3201:22-3202:15  [Record  Document  555].  Some  form  of  restrictive \n11 \n   \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 641   Filed 11/01/22   Page 12 of 165 PageID #: \n35238\nhousing is necessary to ensure the safe operations of a prison. Id.; Pacholke Trial Tr. vol. \nXII at 2787:7-11 [Record Document 553].  \nIn December 2019, DWCC began to implement a new DOC classification policy, \nB-02-019. Ex. P-JJJ-42 [Record Document 564-205]. The policy, however, was not in full \neffect as of March 2020. Indeed, the policy underwent multiple changes before being \nfinalized in 2021. At the close of discovery, the only change in effect was that DWCC \naltered certain restrictive housing terminology. Goodwin Trial Tr. vol. XVIII at 4392:4-19 \n[Record  Document  562].  Instead  of  extended  lockdown  or  isolation  status,16  DWCC \nstarted  to  use  the  terms  1)  investigative  segregation,  2)  disciplinary  segregation,  3) \npreventative segregation, and 4) transitional segregation. Record Document 524 ¶ 243. See \nalso Baird Trial Tr. vol. XIV at 1059:8-11 [Record Document 555].17 In other words, \n“disciplinary  detention  isolation”  morphed  into  “disciplinary  segregation”  and \n“disciplinary extended lockdown” became “preventative segregation.” Goodwin Trial Tr. \nvol. XVIII at 4392:4-19 [Record Document 562]. Regardless of  status,  inmates were \nhoused on the extended lockdown tiers under the same conditions. Record Document 524 \n¶ 244. Significantly, DWCC’s use of strip cell status, as discussed in more detail below, \nwas not affected by this new classification system policy.  \n \n16 Inmates could be placed on disciplinary detention isolation status as a sanction from the \nprison’s disciplinary board. Goodwin Trial Tr. vol. XVIII at 4229:16-4230:2 [Record \nDocument  562].  Isolation  status  involves  greater  restrictions  than  extended  lockdown \nstatus. Id. For example, an inmate loses his bedding during the day. Id. at 4328:6-13. As of \nMarch 2020, isolation status was a viable disciplinary sanction. Id. at 4217:21-24.      \n17 Jacob Baird is DWCC’s Deputy Warden of Security. \n12 \n   \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 641   Filed 11/01/22   Page 13 of 165 PageID #: \n35239\nPursuant to the new policy, inmates on investigative, disciplinary, and preventative \nsegregation  are  housed  on  the  extended  lockdown  tiers.  Inmates  on  investigative \nsegregation are those being investigated for a rule infraction, and they are housed on this \nstatus typically for a short period of time, usually no more than seventy-two hours, while \nthe inmate waits to go before the disciplinary board. Baird Trial Tr. vol. XIV at 1059:13-\n19 [Record Document 555]. Inmates found guilty of a rule infraction could be sentenced \nto disciplinary segregation for a determinate period based on the new disciplinary matrix, \nwhich  accompanied  the  new  classification  policy.  However,  there  was  conflicting \ntestimony as to whether the disciplinary matrix was even in place as of March 2020. \nRegardless, after an inmate completes his disciplinary sentence, he remains on extended \nlockdown for an indefinite period under the status of preventative segregation. Baird Trial \nTr. vol. XIV at 1065:19-1066:11 [Record Document 555]; Goodwin Trial Tr. vol. XVIII \nat 4415:14-20 [Record Document 562]. The inmate remains in the same cell and receives \nthe  same  privileges  whether  on  preventative  or  disciplinary  segregation.18  Record \nDocument 524 ¶ 244.  \nAs of March  2020, B-02-019 had no effect on the classification  review  board \nprocess. Goodwin Trial Tr. vol. XVIII at 4392:16-19, 4414:16-4415:8 [Record Document \n562]. The board reviewed the status of inmates on preventative segregation every ninety \n \n18  An  inmate  immediately  placed  on  extended  lockdown  as  an  initial  classification \ndecision  would  be  considered  in  preventative  segregation.  In  effect,  preventative \nsegregation  also  encompasses  what  was  formally  called  administrative  segregation  at \nDWCC. Compare Ex. J-3 at 5 [Record Document 564-285] (describing administrative \nsegregation), with Ex. P-JJJ-42 at 4 [Record Document 564-205] (describing preventive \nsegregation). It appears parts of administrative segregation were partitioned into the new \nterms investigative, transitional, and preventative segregation.  \n13 \n   \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 641   Filed 11/01/22   Page 14 of 165 PageID #: \n35240\ndays.  Ex.  P-JJJ-42  [Record  Document  564-205].  The  inmate  did  not  attend  the \nclassification review, and mental health played no role in the classification review process. \nMays Trial Tr. vol. IX at 2158:8-17 [Record Document 543]. Eventually, if the board \ndetermined that an inmate met the requirements to be moved to general population, he \ncould  be  transferred  to  transitional  segregation  on  N-1  before  returning  to  general \npopulation.19 Goodwin Trial Tr. vol. XVIII at 4415:14-20 [Record Document 562]. In \nshort, despite the lack of clarity as to what components of this policy were in place before \nthe March 15, 2020 discovery cut-off date, it still provides important context regarding the \nlanguage and processes used in segregated and restricted housing at the time.  \nD.  Level of Care \nBefore being assigned to DWCC, inmates in DOC custody typically receive an \ninitial assessment at Elayn Hunt Correctional Center (“EHCC”). Record Document 524 ¶ \n86. EHCC has reception and diagnostic capacities; it has a psychiatrist on staff and has a \nspecial housing unit for prisoners with a serious mental illness.20 Id. ¶ 87. EHCC provides \n \n19 As stated above, N-1 now serves as a transitional unit. \n20 As discussed in detail below, the DOC’s definition of serious mental illness is based on \ndiagnosis  and  includes  six  enumerated  conditions:  major  depressive  disorder  (MDD), \nschizophrenia,  schizoaffective  disorder,  bipolar  disorder,  unspecified  schizophrenia \nspectrum, and severe anxiety disorder. Ex. P-JJJ-25 at 2 [Record Document 564-204]; see \nalso Ex. P-JJJ-42 at 5 [Record Document 564-205]. Separate from the DOC’s definition, \nserious mental illness is also a term of art in the psychiatric field. The definition of serious \nmental illness, as used by psychiatrists, includes the above enumerated conditions but also \nincludes  a  person  with  a  diagnosed  mental  illness  other  than  the  categorical  mental \nillnesses but whose symptoms cause such a functional impairment that the mental illness \nis recognized as serious based on the “duration . . . and the degree of disability that it is \ncaused by.” Burns Trial Tr. vol. V at 1271:22-1273:13 [Record Document 539]; accord \nThompson Trial Tr. vol. XVII at 4113:2-25 [Record Document 561]. Experts for both \nPlaintiffs and Defendants agree that the DOC’s list is underinclusive.

Id. ¶ 88.  \nThe EHCC assessment consists of personality testing, IQ testing, and interviews, \nand results in a DSM-5 diagnosis of prisoners with mental illness; the findings are detailed \nin an “Assessment & Intervention Report” unique to each prisoner. Id. ¶¶ 89-90. The \ninitial assessment also assigns an inmate a Level of Care (“LOC”) designation for mental \nhealth. Id. ¶ 90. The LOC designations range from 5 (no mental illness) to 1 (most severe). \nId. ¶ 94. \nInmates  designated  LOC-1  have  a  significant  disability  primarily  due  to  their \nmental health condition. Ex. J-7 at 1 [Record Document 565-13]; see also Ex. D-14 at 6-7 \n[Record Document 565-12]. These inmates must be housed in a special mental health \nhousing unit with constant monitoring by mental health staff. Ex. J-7 at 5-6 [Record \nDocument 565-13]; see also Ex. D-14 at 6-7 [Record Document 565-12]. DWCC does not \nhave the capabilities to house inmates classified as LOC-1. See Record Document 524 ¶ \n95; Ex. J-7 at 5 [Record Document 565-13]; Ex. D-14 at 7 [Record Document 565-12].  \n  Inmates classified as LOC-2 have been diagnosed with a serious mental illness and \nare presently unstable—that is, inmates with a diagnosed serious mental illness who have \nbeen in remission for less than six months or have displayed a pattern of instability. Ex. J-\n7  at  6  [Record  Document  565-13];  Ex.  D-14  at  7  [Record  Document  565-12].  One \nexample is an inmate on forced medication. Hayden Trial Tr. vol.

Although LOC-2s can be housed at DWCC per policy, the DOC avoids \nassigning LOC-2s to DWCC because DWCC lacks the necessary resources to safely care \nfor those inmates. See Dauzat Trial Tr. vol. XV at 719:9-25 [Record Document 556]; \naccord Hayden Trial Tr. vol. II at 331:1-5 [Record Document 534]. \nInmates who have been designated as LOC-3 have a diagnosed serious mental \nillness but have been in remission or stable for at least six months. Ex. J-7 at 6 [Record \nDocument 565-13]; Ex. D-14 at 7 [Record Document 565-12]; Burns Trial Tr. vol. VI at \n1477:6-9  [Record  Document  540].  Stable  means  “there  are  not  symptoms  that  are \ndisrupting your functioning at that point in time.” Burns Trial Tr. vol. VI at 1477:16-19 \n[Record Document 540]. In other words, the inmate can function despite having some \nsymptoms—potentially by developing coping skills. Id. at 1477:16-1478:2. Dr. Gregory \nSeal  (“Dr.  Seal”),  DWCC’s  contract  psychiatrist,  described  stable  as  meaning \n“unchanging,” which indicates that the treatment is working. Seal Trial Tr. vol. XVII at \n3858:5-8 [Record Document 561].   \nLOC-4 is assigned to inmates who are diagnosed with mental illness and may be \ntaking medication but are not diagnosed with a serious mental illness. Burns Trial Tr. vol. \nVI at 1476:9-12 [Record Document 540]; accord Hayden Trial Tr. vol. II at 331:12-16 \n[Record Document 534]; Ex. J-7 at 6 [Record Document 565-13]; Ex. D-14 at 8 [Record \nDocument 565-12].  \nDOC Health Care Policy No. HC-36 states LOC-5 “shall be assigned to inmates \nwho are not prescribed any psychotropic medication and who have had no mental health \ninterventions  for  more  than  one  year.”  Ex.  D-14  at  8  [Record  Document  565-12] \n16 \n   \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 641   Filed 11/01/22   Page 17 of 165 PageID #: \n35243\n(emphasis  in  original).  DWCC  Employee  Policy  Memorandum  #3-02-003  states  that \nLOC-5 “shall be assigned to offenders not prescribed any psychotropic medication or \ncurrent mental health intervention for more than one year.” Ex. J-7 at 7 [Record Document \n565-13] (emphasis added). Despite the slight difference in wording, LOC-5 simply means \nthe inmate does not have mental health issues. Burns Trial Tr. vol. VI at 1476:13-15 \n[Record Document 540].      \n  Inmates can be assigned two modifiers to their LOC designation: “F” and “H.” Ex. \nJ-7 at 7 [Record Document 565-13]. The modifier “F” means frequent mental health \ninterventions; this modifier can be added to any LOC designation. Id. The modifier “H” \nmay only be assigned to LOC-5s; it means there is a history of mental health issues. Id.  \nDWCC typically only houses inmates designated as LOC-3, -4, or -5. Dauzat Trial \nTr. vol. III at 719:22-25 [Record Document 536]. LOC-3s and -4s comprise most of the \nmental health caseload at DWCC. Hayden Trial Tr. vol. II at 533:19-534:16 [Record \nDocument 534]. About forty to forty-five percent of the inmates in restrictive housing at \nDWCC are diagnosed with a mental illness. Burns Trial Tr. vol.

DWCC often holds new inmates in segregation pending the initial \nclassification decision. Ex. J-3 at 2 [Record Document 564-285]; Thompson Trial Tr. vol. \nXVII at 4131:16-21 [Record Document 561]. And even if an inmate qualifies for general \npopulation, he may sometimes remain in segregation on “backlog” until a bed becomes \navailable in general population. Ex. J-3 at 2, 5 [Record Document 564-285]. The initial \nclassification determination also could result in the inmate being placed immediately on \nextended lockdown on the South Compound. See, e.g., Turner Trial Tr. vol. I at 45:22-\n46:4 [Record Document 533]; accord Moran Trial Tr. vol. I at 197:6-8 [Record Document \n533]; Adams Trial Tr. vol. IV at 960:2-6 [Record Document 538].

Pacholke Trial Tr. vol. \nXII at 2709:1-12 [Record Document 553]. For example, he has toured numerous prisons \nin Alaska, Illinois, Massachusetts, and Florida, and all the prisons in Washington; he has \nalso toured a handful of prisons in other states, including Virginia, Michigan, Nebraska, \nIndiana, California, Montana, New York, and Ohio. Id.  \nIn this case, Secretary Pacholke toured DWCC for two days in October 2019 and \ninterviewed  a  number  of  prisoners  who  were  housed  in  buildings  N-1  through  N-4. \nPacholke Trial Tr. vol. XI at 2614:13-2615:15 [Record Document 545]. He was accepted \nby the Court as an expert in corrections operations. Id. at 2613:12-17. Secretary Pacholke \ncredibly found that the conditions and practices on the South Compound are extremely \nharsh  compared  to  other  prisons  around  the  country  and  inconsistent  with  modern \ncorrectional practices regarding restrictive housing.   \n2.  Dr. Craig Haney  \nCraig Haney, Ph.D., J.D. (“Dr. Haney”), was another expert for Plaintiffs. He has a \nPh.D. in psychology; he also graduated from Stanford Law School. Haney Trial Tr. vol. \nXII  at  2846:16-2847:3  [Record  Document  553].  Dr.  Haney  has  been  employed  as  a \nprofessor of psychology at the University of California, Santa Cruz for over forty years. \nId. at 2847:24-2848:7. Dr. Haney specializes in social psychology and its interaction with \nthe legal system. Id. at 2846:21-2847:9. Dr. Haney testified, “Social psychology is the \nstudy of how people are changed and affected by the settings or the situations or the \nenvironments in which they find themselves, and we study a range of different kinds of \n25 \n   \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 641   Filed 11/01/22   Page 26 of 165 PageID #: \n35252\nenvironments.” Id. at 2847:5-8. Dr. Haney was accepted as an expert in social psychology \nand solitary confinement. Id. at 2853:24-2854:3. \nDr. Haney is not a clinical psychiatrist and does not diagnose.  Id. at 2851:25-\n2852:4. Dr. Haney’s job in this case was to provide a description of the current state of \nknowledge on the effects of solitary confinement, that is, how people are affected by and \nsometimes harmed by the experience of solitary confinement, to evaluate the conditions of \nconfinement in certain areas of DWCC with respect to whether or not they meet the \ndefinition of solitary confinement or restrictive housing, and to evaluate whether or not the \ninmates are suffering any adverse consequences from solitary confinement as defined in \nthe literature. Id. at 2854:13-2855:13. Furthermore, he was asked the narrower question of \nwhether and how people with mental illnesses suffer more and might be more vulnerable \nto the negative or harmful effects of solitary confinement. Id. \nDr.  Haney  visited  DWCC  on  two  separate  occasions:  in  August  2018  and  in \nOctober 2019. Id. at 2859:23-25. While he was there, he toured buildings N-1 through N-4 \nand the outdoor recreation cages. Id. at 2859:14-19. A photographer accompanied Dr. \nHaney  on  at  least  one  of  his  visits  and  photographed  certain  things  that  Dr.  Haney \nobserved. Id. at 2860:10-24. \nAdditionally, Dr. Haney conducted cell-front and individual interviews of inmates \non extended lockdown. Id. at 2168:8-11. Interviewees for confidential interviews were \nchosen in three ways: 1) by Plaintiffs’ attorneys, 2) by personal selection after cell-front \ninterviews,  and  3)  by  a  randomized  roster  of  inmates  on  extended  lockdown.  Id.  at \n2861:14-2862:1.  During  the  interviews,  Dr.  Haney  utilized  individual  questions  in  a \n26 \n   \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 641   Filed 11/01/22   Page 27 of 165 PageID #: \n35253\nstructured interview format that he has perfected over the course of his career. Id. at \n2862:7-12. Essentially, he inquired about their social backgrounds, their mental health \nhistory, and their involvement in the prison system. Id. at 2862:15-2864:11. He asked \nthem questions about things that people experience in solitary confinement and whether \nthese  things  have  bothered  them.  Id.  He  also  reviewed  the  medical  records  of  those \ninterviewed individuals, and he reviewed DWCC and DOC policies. Id. at 2865:11-20. \n  As will be detailed below, Dr. Haney credibly established that prolonged solitary \nconfinement  could  produce  numerous  negative  psychological  effects  that  can  harm \ninmates  mentally and physically and that many inmates on the South Compound are \nexposed to these stressors and reported high levels of suffering from the effects of solitary \nconfinement.  \n3.  Dr. Kathryn Burns \nKathryn Burns, M.D. (“Dr. Burns”), the former chief psychiatrist for the Ohio \nDepartment of Corrections, appeared as an expert witness for Plaintiffs. She was accepted \nby the Court as an expert in the field of clinical psychiatry and corrections systems. Burns \nTrial Tr. vol. V at 1260:2-6 [Record Document 539]. She has extensive experience in \nproviding mental health care in correctional settings, as well as designing and setting \npolicies for the delivery of mental health care. See id. at 1236:15-1251:10. Indeed, much \nof her professional career has been dedicated to the delivery of mental health services to \nincarcerated individuals. Id. Dr. Burns has served as an expert witness in many cases, and \nshe has even been selected as a “special master” in multiple prison litigation suits, where \nshe  became  the  “jointly  agreed  upon  expert  for  monitoring  the  results”  and  “the \n27 \n   \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 641   Filed 11/01/22   Page 28 of 165 PageID #: \n35254\nimplementation of [the] agreement.” Burns Trial Tr. vol. V at 1250:11-1251:10 [Record \nDocument 539].  \nDr. Burns has a Bachelor of Science from Cleveland State University and a medical \ndegree from Case Western Reserve University; she completed her psychiatric residency at \nUniversity Hospitals in Cleveland and completed a forensic fellowship. Id. at 1248:1-6. \nShe has earned a master’s degree in public health from Ohio State University. Id. at \n1248:6-8. She is certified by the American Board of Psychology and Neurology in general \npsychiatry and forensic psychiatry. Id. at 1248:13-20.  \nDr. Burns served two terms as the chief psychiatrist for the Ohio Department of \nRehabilitation and Corrections from 1995 to 1999 and then again from 2013 to 2018. Id. \nat 1240:1-10. On both occasions she was responsible for overseeing the delivery of mental \nhealth  services  to  the  inmates.  Id.  at  1240:12-14.  She  was  responsible  for  policy \ndevelopment and the development of additional levels of care within the department of \ncorrections.  Id.  at  1240:21-1241:2.  She  also  developed  policies  on  residential  care, \ninpatient care, outpatient care, involuntary medication administration, and the transfer of a \npatient from a correctional facility into a psychiatric hospital. Id. Additionally, she was \ncharged  with  recruiting  and  retaining  psychiatric  staff  for  the  Ohio  Department  of \nRehabilitation and  Corrections.  Id.  at 1241:3-5.  Under her leadership,  the department \ncreated crisis stabilization units and suicide prevention policies.  Id. at 1241:5-7 \nIn between stints for the Ohio Department of Corrections, she served as Chief of \nForensics Services at the state hospital in Columbus. Id. at 1244:17-21. She supervised \npsychiatrists and continued to perform competency and sanity evaluations. Id. at 1244:21-\n28 \n   \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 641   Filed 11/01/22   Page 29 of 165 PageID #: \n35255\n1245:1. She also provided direct psychiatric care to inmates at the Franklin County jail \nfacilities in Columbus, Ohio. Id. at 1245:1-6.  \nAs part of this case, Dr. Burns visited DWCC twice—once in August 2018 and \nonce in October 2019. Id. at 1254:21, 1256:2-3. Her focus was to assess the mental health \ncare provided to inmates on extended lockdown at DWCC. Id. at 1255:14-17, 1256:24-\n1257:4. Dr. Burns’s methodology was to review the policies and procedures of the DOC \nand  DWCC.  Dr.  Burns  also  conducted  cell-front  and  individual  interviews  with  the \ninmates  on  extended  lockdown  at  DWCC  and  examined  standards  and  physician \nstatements  from  professional  organizations.  Based  on  her  training,  experience,  and \neducation, Dr. Burns credibly established that DWCC fails to deliver adequate mental \nhealth care to inmates on extended lockdown at DWCC and that these inadequacies harm \ninmates housed there, particularly the mentally ill.     \n4.  Dr. John Thompson  \nJohn Thompson, M.D. (“Dr. Thompson”), appeared as an expert for Defendants. \nDr. Thompson has a medical degree from the University of Texas at San Antonio and did \nhis  residency  training  at  the  University  of  Florida.  Thompson  Trial  Tr.  vol.  XVII  at \n3943:13-21  [Record  Document  561].  He  also  completed  a  forensic  fellowship  in  the \nfourth year of his training. Id. at 3943:21-23. His residency was in psychiatry and forensic \npsychiatry. Id. at 3943:25. He defined forensic psychiatry as the point at which psychiatry \ninterfaces with the law and can include commenting on rules and regulations to legislators, \ncorrectional psychiatry, inpatient state hospital psychiatric care, or medical malpractice. \nId. at 3944:1-13. \n29 \n   \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 641   Filed 11/01/22   Page 30 of 165 PageID #: \n35256\nDr. Thompson is board certified in general psychiatry with added qualifications in \nforensic  psychiatry  and  addiction  psychiatry.  Id.  at  3944:14-17.  He  is  licensed  in \nLouisiana, Alabama, and Colorado. Id. at 3945:3-6. He is affiliated primarily with Tulane \nUniversity Hospital systems and East Louisiana Mental Health System (“ELMHS”), the \nstate hospital in Jackson, Louisiana. Id. at 3945:8-13. Dr. Thompson is Chief of Staff at \nELMHS and the chairman of the Department of Psychiatry at Tulane. Id. at 3945:14-\n3946:25. He has been involved in developing a forensic fellowship program at Tulane. Id. \nat  3947:3-3948:6.  Dr.  Thompson  testified  that  he  has  consulted  before  to  evaluate \ncorrectional systems and has consulted to establish treatment programs within correctional \nsystems over the years but has never testified in a similar case. Id. at 3948:24-3949:4. Part \nof his consulting experience involved supervising three doctors who provided treatment at \nEHCC and the Louisiana Correctional Institute for Women for about three years. Id. at \n3949:16-3950:12. He also supervises a doctor who provides care at the New Orleans \nJustice Center. Id. at 3950:13-17. \nDr. Thompson and two of his direct reports, Dr. Herman Soong and Dr. Sankep \nVyas, have evaluated different prison systems in the past, including the Bridgewater State \nHospital in Massachusetts29 (where they reviewed restraint data) and the Tutwiler Prison \nin Alabama (an all-female prison where they were tasked with assisting the prison in \nmeeting the National Commission on Correctional Health Care’s standards). Id. at 3951:3-\n \n29 It is important to note that Bridgewater State Hospital is not a prison or correctional \nfacility. It is a state hospital. Specifically, Dr. Thompson calls it a “forensic hospital.” \nThompson Trial Tr. vol. XVII at 4104:19-4105:1 [Record Document 561]. Though \nimportant, Dr. Thompson’s experience at the state hospital cannot be equated to \nexperience in the correctional setting.  \n30 \n   \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 641   Filed 11/01/22   Page 31 of 165 PageID #: \n35257\n3953:25, 3963:23-3964:20. For his report, Dr. Thompson, Dr. Soong, and Dr. Vyas visited \nDWCC twice; the first visit being April 29-30, 2019, and the second on January 8, 2020. \nId. at 3964:19-22. The three doctors interviewed a total of fifty-one inmates at DWCC, \nmost of whom were assigned to restricted housing units. Id. at 3965:24-3966:12. Neither \nDr. Soong nor Dr. Vyas testified.  \nThe Court finds that Dr. Burns’s experience in developing policies and procedures \nfor  prisons  as  well  as  her  knowledge  of  treatment  of  the  mentally  ill  at  prisons \novershadows that of Dr. Thompson. Currently, Dr. Thompson does not provide services in \na  prison  setting.  Id.  at  3958:19-21.  Additionally,  Dr.  Thompson  has  never  published \nanything about the effects of solitary confinement on mental health or the effects of \nsocialization on mental health. Id. at 3961:10-17.  \n It is important to note that, while there may be some similarities between the \ntreatment of patients at a hospital like ELMHS, it is a medical setting and not a prison \nsetting. There are key differences between state hospitals for the mentally ill and prisons; \nthese differences include the resources and treatment available to the patient, the use of \ndisciplinary  practices  (including  the  use  of  force),  and  the  overall  purpose  for \ninstitutionalizing these individuals (the emphasis of treatment in a mental health setting \nversus the punitive nature of the prison), to name a few. These differences make Dr. \nBurns’s testimony more reliable and credible than Dr. Thompson’s.  \nThe  Court  declined  to  qualify  Dr.  Thompson  as  an  expert  psychiatrist  in  the \nprovision of mental health care in correctional systems. Instead, the Court qualified him as \n31 \n   \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 641   Filed 11/01/22   Page 32 of 165 PageID #: \n35258\na forensic psychiatrist, which Dr. Thompson admitted is his typical tender. See id. at \n3961:1-3962:7.  \n5.  James Upchurch  \n \nJames  R.  Upchurch  (“Upchurch”)  appeared  as  an  expert  for  the  Defendants. \nUpchurch has a master’s degree in interdisciplinary sciences, which include the study of \nbiology, chemistry, and mathematics. Upchurch Trial Tr. vol. XIV at 3178:12-18 [Record \nDocument 555]. He also has received other certifications in public administration and \nmanagement  through  Arizona  State  University,  the  National  Institute  of  Corrections \n(“NIC”), and the University of Southern California. Id. at 3178:19-23. Upchurch was \naccepted by this Court as an expert in prison operations and security. See id. at 3191:3-\n3192:3.  The  Court  declined  to  certify  Upchurch  as  an  expert  in  segregated  housing \nbecause, although he has some experience in the area, it does not rise to the level of \nmaking him independently qualified as an expert in that area. Id. at 3192:3-10.   \nUpchurch  has  approximately  forty-five  years  of  experience  working  at  various \nlevels and capacities within corrections facilities across Mississippi, Arizona, and Florida. \nId. at 3179:5-3183:24. Over the course of his career, Upchurch has held thirteen different \njob  titles,  with  varying  levels  of  supervisory,  management,  and  decision-making \nresponsibilities,  including  deputy  warden  for  operations  at  the  Mississippi  State \nPenitentiary, unit warden for the Arizona State Prison Complex special management unit, \nthe Chief of Bureau Security Operations for the Florida Department of Corrections, and \nthe  Director  of  Operations  and  Support  Deputy  Assistant  Secretary  for  the  Florida \nDepartment of Corrections. Id.  \n32 \n   \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 641   Filed 11/01/22   Page 33 of 165 PageID #: \n35259\nIn 1997, the NIC asked Upchurch to begin consulting on security auditing and the \nestablishment of security standards. Id. at 3186:13-19. As part of his consulting work with \nthe  NIC,  Upchurch  conducted  on-site  security  audits  and  assessments  on  facility \noperations at correctional institutions across thirty-eight states.  Id.  at 3186:16-3187:5. \nUpchurch also created the staffing analysis program at the NIC. Id. at 3187:19-30. After \nhis  retirement  from  his  role  as  Assistant  Secretary  for  Institutions  with  the  Florida \nDepartment  of  Corrections  in  2015,  Upchurch  began  his  own  consulting  business, \nUpchurch Consulting. Id. at 3183:20-24.  \nAs part of this case, Upchurch conducted an on-site visit to DWCC on January 27 \nand  28,  2020.  Id.  at  3251:5-6.  During  his  visit,  Upchurch  visited  parts  of  the  North \nCompound, though most of his time was spent touring sections of N1, N2, N3, and N4 on \nthe South Compound. Id. at 3227:6-18. He also was able to observe inmate interactions, \nspeak with DWCC staff, visit the “key room” where inmates placed on suicide watch are \nobserved on camera, and converse with Warden Goodwin. See id. at 3278:17-3280:10. As \npart of his methodology, Upchurch reviewed the prison files of three DWCC inmates: \nLarry Jones, Ronald Brooks, and Bruce Charles for the purpose of comparing their watch \nstatus to their medical records. Id. at 3244:29-3245:5. In his testimony, Upchurch stated \nthat he evaluated various DWCC internal policies, but specific reference was only made to \nPolicy 34, e.g., id. at 3253:12-25,30 as well as the American Correctional Association’s \n2019 accreditation audit. Id. at 3213:10-11. Upchurch’s testimony provided contextual \n \n30 During his testimony, other policies are referenced more generally. See, e.g., Upchurch \nTrial Tr. vol. XIV at 3260:10 [Record Document 555] (“the use of force policy”), or e.g., \nid. at 3221:9 (“You’re referring to the draft policy?”).  \n33 \n   \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 641   Filed 11/01/22   Page 34 of 165 PageID #: \n35260\ninformation on the operation of correctional facilities. He also provided his expert opinion \non  the  extent  to  which  DWCC’s  policies  and  operations  were  consistent  with  other \ncorrectional facilities he has observed, see, e.g., id. at 3240:8-25, as well as the standards \noutlined  in  the  fourth  and  fifth  editions  of  the  American  Correctional  Association’s \nrequirements for accreditation. E.g., id. at 3190:22-25.  \nIV.  Eighth Amendment Claims \nA.  Background  \n“Central to all other corrections goals is the institutional consideration of internal \nsecurity within the corrections facilities themselves.” Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 546-\n47 (1979) (cleaned up). Prison officials are afforded wide discretion “in the application of \npolicies and practices designed to maintain security and preserve internal order.” McCord \nv. Maggio, 910 F.2d 1248, 1251 (5th Cir. 1990). This includes separating inmates from \nother inmates, imposing discipline, and using reasonable force. See id.; see also Turner v. \nLynaugh, 40 F.3d 385, 1994 WL 652587, at *4 (5th Cir. 1994) (per curiam).  \nAt the same time, the Eighth Amendment grants all persons the right to be free \nfrom “cruel and unusual punishments.” U.S. Const. amend. VIII (“Excessive bail shall not \nbe required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted.”). \nAlthough the Eighth Amendment “does not mandate comfortable prisons,” Rhodes v. \nChapman, 452 U.S. 337, 349 (1981), “[p]rison officials must provide humane conditions \nof confinement; they must ensure that inmates receive adequate food, clothing, shelter, \nand medical care, and must take reasonable measure to ensure the safety of the inmates,” \nGates v. Cook, 376 F.3d 323, 332 (5th Cir. 2004). “Mental health needs are no less serious \n34 \n   \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 641   Filed 11/01/22   Page 35 of 165 PageID #: \n35261\nthan physical needs.” Id. “While the prison administration may punish, it may not do so in \na manner that threatens the physical and mental health of prisoners.” Young v. Quinlan, \n960 F.2d 351, 364 (3d Cir. 1992) (cleaned up) (emphasis added).  \nPlaintiffs  contend  that  DWCC  violates  the  Eighth  Amendment  because  the \nconditions on the South Compound at DWCC constitute mental torture. Plaintiffs allege \nthat DWCC houses  inmates, many of whom suffer from mental illness, in  inhumane \nconditions  for  months  (sometimes  years)  with  minimal  property  and  little  to  no \nmeaningful social interaction and environmental stimulation. Along with the inhumane \nconditions, Plaintiffs maintain that DWCC fails to provide inmates adequate mental health \ncare while on the South Compound. It is the inhumane conditions and the failure to deliver \nadequate  mental  health  services  that,  Plaintiffs  argue,  cause  inmates  to  undergo \ndecompensation and expose them to a substantial risk of serious harm.  \nB.  Eighth Amendment Standard \nAs stated above, the Eighth Amendment mandates inmates be housed in humane \nconditions, though not necessarily comfortable ones. Rhodes, 452 U.S. at 349; Cook, 376 \nF.3d at 332. In determining whether prison officials have violated the Eighth Amendment, \ncourts must apply a two-part test. The first part is an objective test; courts must consider \nwhether the alleged constitutional deprivation is of a “sufficiently serious” nature. See \nWilson v. Seiter, 501 U.S. 294, 298 (1991) (summarizing the objective component as \nasking whether the deprivation was “sufficiently serious”). To be sufficiently serious, the \nalleged deprivation must result in the denial of the “minimal civilized measure of life’s \nnecessities,” Rhodes, 452 U.S. at 347, or result in inmates being housed under conditions \n35 \n   \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 641   Filed 11/01/22   Page 36 of 165 PageID #: \n35262\nthat pose a substantial risk of serious harm, Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 834 (1995); \nsee also Helling v. McKinney, 509 U.S. 25, 35 (1993). The United States Supreme Court \nhas made clear that these standards are not static but should be based on “the evolving \nstandards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society.” Farmer, 511 U.S. at \n833-34; Rhodes, 452 U.S. at 346.   \n  The second part of the test is subjective; the fact finder must determine whether the \ndefendants  were  deliberately  indifferent  to  an  inmate’s  health  and  safety.  “A  prison \nofficial  displays  deliberate  indifference  only  if  he  (1)  ‘knows  that  inmates  face  a \nsubstantial risk of serious bodily harm’ and (2) ‘disregards that risk by failing to take \nreasonable measures to abate it.’” Arenas v. Calhoun, 922 F.3d 616, 620 (5th Cir. 2019) \n(quoting Gobert v. Caldwell, 463 F.3d 339, 346 (5th Cir. 2006)). An obvious risk could be \nsufficient to allow a fact finder to conclude that prison officials knew of the risk. Hinojosa \nv. Livingston, 807 F.3d 657, 667 (5th Cir. 2015) (citing Cook, 376 F.3d at 340); see \nFarmer, 511 U.S. at 842; Harris v. Hegmann, 198 F.3d 153, 159 (5th Cir. 1999). Willful \nblindness is not a defense. See Farmer, 511 U.S. at 843 n.8 (stating a defendant “would \nnot escape liability if the evidence showed that he merely refused to verify underlying \nfacts that he strongly suspected to be true, or declined to confirm inferences of risk that he \nstrongly suspected to exist”). “The long duration of a cruel punishment condition may \nmake it easier to establish knowledge and hence some form of intent.” Wilson, 501 U.S. at \n300.  \n36 \n   \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 641   Filed 11/01/22   Page 37 of 165 PageID #: \n35263\n  The  Court  will  first  address  Plaintiffs’  claim  that  the  conditions  on  the  South \nCompound are inhumane before moving to their claim regarding the systemic deficiencies \nin the delivery of mental health services to inmates in extended lockdown.  \nC.  Conditions of Confinement  \nPlaintiffs attack the conditions of confinement on the South Compound at DWCC. \nThe evidence at trial showed that inmates on the South Compound are exposed to a \nsubstantial risk of psychological harm by policies causing or related to social isolation, \nenforced  idleness,  and  indefinite  exposure  to  conditions  on  extended  lockdown.  As \ndetailed below, Plaintiffs’ evidence credibly established that the conditions, policies, and \npractices in place on the South Compound subject inmates to a significant risk of severe \npsychological pain by depriving them of meaningful human contact, personal property, \nand mental stimulation for an indefinite period. Furthermore, in spite of their awareness of \nthese unlawful conditions, Defendants have been deliberately indifferent by failing to take \nreasonable steps to alleviate those conditions.     \n1.  Substantial Risk of Serious Harm  \nAlthough the need for segregation is within Defendants’ sound discretion, “there is \na line where [its] conditions [can] become so severe that its use is converted from a viable \nprisoner disciplinary tool to cruel and unusual punishment.” Gates v. Collier, 501 F.2d \n1291, 1304 (5th Cir. 1974). “[A] remedy for unsafe conditions need not await a tragic \nevent.” Helling, 509 U.S. at 33. “Conditions of confinement may establish an Eighth \nAmendment violation ‘in combination’ when each would not do so alone, but only when \nthey have a mutually enforcing effect that produces the deprivation of a single, identifiable \n37 \n   \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 641   Filed 11/01/22   Page 38 of 165 PageID #: \n35264\nhuman need.” Cook, 376 F.3d at 333 (citation omitted). “It goes without question that an \nincarceration  that  inflicts  daily,  permanently  damaging,  physical  injury  and  pain  is \nunconstitutional . . . [T]he same standards that protect against physical torture prohibit \nmental torture as well—including the mental torture of excessive deprivation.” Ruiz v. \nJohnson, 37 F. Supp. 2d 855, 914 (S.D. Tex. 1999). “Mental health, just as much as \nphysical health, is a mainstay of life. Indeed, it is beyond any serious dispute that mental \nhealth is a need as essential to a meaningful human existence as other basic physical \ndemands our bodies may make for shelter, warmth or sanitation.” Madrid v. Gomez, 889 \nF. Supp. 1146, 1261 (N.D. Cal. 1995). If “the particular conditions of segregation being \nchallenged are such that they inflict a serious mental illness, greatly exacerbate mental \nillness, or deprive inmates of their sanity, then [D]efendants have deprived inmates of a \nbasic  necessity  of  human  existence—indeed,  they  have  crossed  into  the  realm  of \npsychological torture.” Id. at 1264. \n(a)  Psychological Harms of Solitary Confinement   \nSolitary confinement31 is “an environment in which prisoners are kept in their cell \nupwards of [twenty-two] or more hours a day” and are “kept away from or not allowed to \nparticipate  in  the  normal  day-to-day  routines  that  prisoners  in  general  population \nparticipate  in,”  such  as  vocational  training,  work  programs,  and  educational  courses. \nHaney Trial Tr. vol. XII at 2867:22-2868:2 [Record Document 553]. Additionally, there \n \n31 As stated above, DWCC refers to solitary confinement as extended lockdown.  \n38 \n   \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 641   Filed 11/01/22   Page 39 of 165 PageID #: \n35265\nare various levels of material deprivations.32 Id. at 2868:6-16. The restricted housing units \nare designed to decrease social interactions and environmental stimulations and enforce \nidleness. \nThere is a consensus in the correctional field and scientific literature that long-term \nsegregation in solitary confinement poses a significant risk of harm to the mental health of \nall inmates and is especially harmful for inmates with mental illness. See id. at 2872:17-\n21; accord Thompson Trial Tr. vol. XVII at 4105:16-4107:3 [Record Document 561]. Dr. \nHaney,  who has spent over forty years  studying the  psychological effects  of  solitary \nconfinement, see generally Ex. P-K-05 [Record Document 564-63], testified that there has \nbeen research on the issue of solitary confinement that goes back a century and a half. \nHaney Trial Tr. vol. XII at 2872:25-2873:3 [Record Document 553]. Related to this body \nof  research  is  the  study  of  the  negative  psychological  and  medical  effects  of  social \nisolation  in  the  world  at  large.  Id.  at  2873:22-2874:1.  In  summarizing  the  literature \nregarding solitary confinement, and social isolation generally, and the effect on mental \nhealth, Dr. Haney unequivocally testified that the absence of meaningful human contact \nand  social  interaction,  along  with  enforced  idleness  for  prolonged  periods  of  time, \nproduces  negative  psychological  effects  that  expose  inmates  to  psychological  and, \nsometimes, physical harm. Id. at 2873:16-2874:17. \n \n32 Some solitary confinement units around the country allow inmates to have access to \ntelevisions, radios, or a tablet. Haney Trial Tr. vol. XII at 2868:6-16 [Record Document \n553]. As detailed below, at DWCC, however, virtually all property is taken away, except \nfor limited reading material.  \n39 \n   \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 641   Filed 11/01/22   Page 40 of 165 PageID #: \n35266\nThe harm can be severe and lead to permanent dysfunction. Dr. Haney testified that \nthe harmful effects “cluster in certain areas of a person’s functioning.” Id. at 2874:18-23. \nSolitary confinement can take a toll on an individual’s emotional well-being, behavioral \nhealth, and cognitive and intellectual functioning. Id. at 2874:23-2876:14. It can also \ndestabilize one’s identity and create long-term distance between the person and others, \neven after he is released from solitary confinement. Id. at 2874:23-2878:10. Specifically, \ninmates  are  placed  at  risk  of  experiencing  disturbances,  severe  anxiety,  a  sense  of \nimpending emotional breakdown, hypersensitivity to stimuli, irritability, aggression, rage, \nloss  of  control,  ruminations,  paranoia,  perceptual  distortions,  cognitive  dysfunction, \nhallucinations,  depression,  self-mutilation,  suicidal  ideation  and  behavior,  and  social \nwithdrawal. See id. at 2877:15-2880:24, 2962:8-2964:25. \nThere  is  also  widespread  agreement  that  restrictive  housing  and  solitary \nconfinement pose an even greater risk of harm to inmates with mental illness. See Burns \nTrial Tr. vol. V at 1266:20-1273:13 [Record Document 539]; accord Haney Trial Tr. vol. \nXII at 2879:18-20 [Record Document 553]; Thompson Trial Tr. vol. XVII at 4105:16-\n4107:3 [Record Document 561]. Dr. Burns, testifying from a clinical perspective, stated \nthat there is agreement among the literature and experts in the field that inmates with \nserious mental illness have a particularly difficult time with the conditions in restrictive \nhousing,33 which include the absence of meaningful social interactions, enforced idleness, \n \n33 Dr. Burns clarified her use of the terms restrictive housing, segregated housing, \nextended lockdown, administrative segregation, and disciplinary segregation, and solitary \nconfinement. She explained that currently in the field of corrections being locked down \nfor more than twenty-two hours a day is referred to as “restrictive housing.” But she \n40 \n   \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 641   Filed 11/01/22   Page 41 of 165 PageID #: \n35267\nsensory deprivations, and the restrictive and oppressive security measures. Burns Trial Tr. \nvol. V at 1265:21-1266:19 [Record Document 539]. Furthermore, inmates with mental \nillness are at a greater risk of decompensating in a restrictive housing setting. Restrictive \nhousing can exacerbate a preexisting mental illness or cause the activation of symptoms \nthat  were  previously  in  remission.  As  a  result,  many  professional  organizations  have \ncondemned the long-term use of solitary confinement for inmates with mental illness.  \nThe American Psychiatric Association issued a position statement in 2012 in which \nit advised against ever keeping a person who is suffering from serious mental illness in \nsolitary confinement for a period of longer than four weeks. Haney Trial Tr. vol. XII at \n2889:7-17 [Record Document 553]. Dr. Haney articulated that the National Commission \non Correctional Health Care, an organization of professional health care administrators \nwho work in correctional settings, issued a position paper in 2016 in which it argued that \nnobody should be housed in solitary confinement for more than fifteen days and that a \nperson  with  a  serious  mental  illness  should  never  be  placed  in  solitary  confinement \nbecause of the heightened risk of harm that vulnerable populations like the mentally ill \nexperience in solitary confinement. Id. at 2889:18-2890:10. \nDefendants challenged Dr. Haney’s conclusions by citing the “Colorado Study.”  \nDr. Thompson testified that the Colorado Study was a longitudinal study of the entire \nColorado prison system to prove that restrictive housing causes or aggravates mental \n \nexplained that the other terms are “subsets” within restrictive housing. She testified that all \nof the inmates on the South Compound are in restrictive housing, with the exception of \nsome individuals on N-1 who are being prepared for release to the community. Burns \nTrial Tr. vol. V at 1264:15-1265:20 [Record Document 539].  \n \n41 \n   \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 641   Filed 11/01/22   Page 42 of 165 PageID #: \n35268\nillness. Thompson Trial Tr. vol. XVII at 4059:11-4060:18 [Record Document 561]. After \nthe one-year study concluded, the researchers found that restrictive housing did not cause \nor worsen mental illness because people acclimate to the environment. Id. at 4060:11-18.  \nThe Court, however, finds Dr. Haney’s testimony credible in that the Colorado \nStudy is an outlier study and  is  flawed.  Haney Trial Tr.  vol.  XII  at 2881:23-2882:7 \n[Record  Document  553].  Indeed,  Colorado  abolished  long-term  solitary  confinement \nnotwithstanding this study. Id. at 2893:4-16. Additionally, Dr. Thompson acknowledged \nthat the results run counter to what many psychiatrists in the field think. See generally \nThompson Trial Tr. vol. XVII at 4061:13-25 [Record Document 561]. More germane, Dr. \nThompson acknowledged that the inmates in Colorado received greater privileges (such as \nprogramming) than inmates at DWCC, and were single celled, so the results could differ \nat DWCC. Id. at 4059:21-4060:3. The Court finds that the factual differences as to the \nconditions of confinement in the Colorado Study and those at DWCC limit the Colorado \nStudy’s  relevance  to  this  litigation.  Dr.  Thompson  bases  his  opinion  that  restrictive \nhousing does not have an adverse effect on inmates’ mental health solely on the basis of \nreciting to the Court what he read in the Colorado Study, as opposed to his own research \nor observation. Finally, the Court finds that Defendants’ contention that extended stays in \nsegregated housing has no adverse effects on mental health is belied by its own policy that \nsegregated inmates must have an evaluation every thirty and ninety days. The segregated \ninmate interviews will be discussed in further depth in a later section.  \nAccordingly, the Court finds that the severity of the conditions and length of the \nstay in restrictive housing or extended lockdown work in tandem to create a serious risk of \n42 \n   \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 641   Filed 11/01/22   Page 43 of 165 PageID #: \n35269\nharm. See Burns Trial Tr. vol. V at 1269:5-1271:5 [Record Document 539]. And, at \nDWCC, the conditions on the South Compound are stark.  \n(b)  Conditions on the South Compound  \nBuildings N-1 through N-4 serve as restrictive housing units at DWCC. As of \nMarch 2020, 366 inmates resided in buildings N-1 through N-4. Ex. J-21 at 9 [Record \nDocument 565-49]. Inmates on the South Compound are stripped of virtually all personal \nbelongings  and  deprived  of  meaningful  human  contact  and  mental  stimulation  for \nindefinite, but often lengthy, periods through policies and practices in place at DWCC. \nThe near total deprivation, however, starts with the physical design and composition of the \ntiers on the South Compound.  \ni.  Physical Composition and Environment  \nThe  evidence  showed  that  the  physical  composition  of  the  tiers  on  the  South \nCompound was designed to reduce activity and positive stimulation. The cells in buildings \nN-1  through  N-4  are  stark  and  extremely  small—approximately  fifty-six  square  feet, \nwhich is non-compliant with the American Correctional Association standards for cell size \nand substantially smaller than other isolation units throughout the country. Haney Trial Tr. \nvol. XIII at 2982:17-2983:3 [Record Document 554]; Upchurch Trial Tr. vol. XIV at \n3213:13-3214:10 [Record Document 555]; see Madrid, 889 F. Supp. at 1228 (describing \ncells that were eighty square feet). The cells have either a single or a double built-in bunk, \na toilet-sink unit, a mirror, and a metal footlocker for storing items.34 See, e.g., Ex. P-\n \n34 In connection with Dr. Haney’s testimony, Plaintiffs admitted multiple photographs as \nExhibit P-GGG, including photographs of the cells. See, e.g., Exs. P-GGG-27 [Record \n43 \n   \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 641   Filed 11/01/22   Page 44 of 165 PageID #: \n35270\nGGG-27 [Record Document 564-185]. Inmates who are double-bunked must share this \nsmall space with other inmates.35  \nThe tiers also provide no visual stimulation. All cells on the South Compound are \nopen front cells that face concrete walls and the outer windows; the cell doors are made of \nperforated metal, which significantly blocks vision out of the cell.36 See Record Document \n524 ¶ 43. Willie Dillon, a testifying inmate, stated that, at times, he could see outside the \ntier windows but could only view the exterior wall of the neighboring housing building. \nSee Dillon Trial Tr. vol. I at 262:1-7 [Record Document 533]. Most of the time, however, \nonly white concrete walls are within the inmates’ visibility. Adams Trial Tr. vol. IV at \n961:4-13 [Record Document 538]. \nThe noise level on the tiers fluctuates between complete silence and loud chaos. \nCarlton  Turner  and  Corey  Adams,  testifying  inmates,  described  how  the  tiers  were \n \nDocument  564-185],  P-GGG-33  [Record  Document  564-186],  P-GGG-34  [Record \nDocument  564-187],  P-GGG-124  [Record  Document  564-195],  P-GGG-147  [Record \nDocument 564-198], P-GGG-149 [Record Document 564-199]. Some of the photographs \nwere sealed for institutional security.  \n35  Dr.  Haney  credibly  explained  that  confining  two  people  in  this  tight  space  for  a \nprolonged period is not meaningful social interaction and can even be more deleterious to \nthe mental health of those inmates, exposing them to a greater risk of harm. Dr. Haney \ntestified, “Even though you are with someone, you are alone in a way. I’ve sometimes said \nthat people who are in these double-celled conditions are both overcrowded and isolated. \nThey’re crowded too close together for too long a period of time.” Haney Trial Tr. vol. \nXIII at 2988:13-17 [Record Document 553]. He further stated that the “unavoidably close \ncontact is potentially very dangerous in a different way because of the possibility that \nconflict will arise between people who are housed under those conditions with virtually \nnothing to do and virtually no opportunity to get away from one another.” Id. at 2989:1-5. \nThe existence of a cellmate in such close quarters thus does not provide for meaningful \nsocial contact. \n36 See Exs. P-GGG-35 [Record Document 564-188], P-GGG-36 [Record Document 564-\n189],  P-GGG-145  [Record  Document  564-196],  P-GGG-146  [Record  Document  564-\n197], P-GGG-149 [Record Document 564-199]. \n44 \n   \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 641   Filed 11/01/22   Page 45 of 165 PageID #: \n35271\nsometimes miserably “quiet.” Id. at 961:21-962:9; accord Turner Trial Tr. vol. I at 47:12-\n17 [Record Document 533]. Per policy, inmates are not permitted to communicate with \ninmates outside of their cell, but if they have a cellmate, they can converse with each other \nin low conversational tones. See Ex. P-JJJ-24 at 2 [Record Document 564-203]. Other \ninmates, however, testified consistently that the tiers would get “very loud” and that there \nwas “a lot of screaming and hollering.” Solomon Trial Tr. vol. III at 596:10-16 [Record \nDocument 534]. Damion Brumfield testified that extended lockdown was loud and filthy \nlike a “zoo” and that every sound “echoes” down the tier.37 Brumfield Trial Tr. vol. I at \n155:1-22 [Record Document 533].  \nAdditionally, inmates have no control over the climate on the tiers. The buildings \non the South Compound have fans and heaters but do not have air conditioning. Baird \nTrial Tr. vol. IV at 1070:18-21 [Record Document 538]. At DWCC, the inmate housing \nunits are the only buildings without air conditioning. Dauzat Trial Tr. vol. XV at 3437:13-\n3439:10 [Record Document 556]. This causes the tiers to become “excruciatingly hot” \nduring the summer. Turner Trial Tr. vol. I at 48:8-10 [Record Document 533]. Inmates \nconsistently testified that the oscillating fans provide no relief from the heat. See, e.g., \nMoran Trial Tr. vol. I at 237:6-22 [Record Document 533]. DWCC only provides inmates \nwith ice at mealtime and damp clothes or paper towels to counter the heat. Id. at 240:1-11. \nAnd so, inmates often have to take extreme measures to cool off. One inmate, Ronald \nBrooks, testified that he stuck his feet in the toilet to cool down. Da’marcus Thomas and \n \n37 Dr. Burns testified that a harmful effect of solitary confinement at DWCC is the “den of \nnoise” that inmates have no control over and can find “difficult to tolerate.” Burns Trial \nTr. vol. V at 1265:23-1266:14, 1271:9-18 [Record Document 539]. \n45 \n   \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 641   Filed 11/01/22   Page 46 of 165 PageID #: \n35272\nJoshua McDowell testified that they laid on the floor to cool off, and in McDowell’s \nparticular case, he removed his jumpsuit and poured water on the floor to lay in it. Thomas \nDep. vol. I at 37:1-12 [Record Document 533]; McDowell Trial Tr. vol. IV at 1012:18-\n1013:11 [Record Document 538].   \nConversely, in the winter, the tiers become “extremely cold.” Quentin Moran, an \ninmate, testified that the tier windows are left open because some are broken, so the cold \nair fills the tier. Moran Trial Tr. vol. I at 199:9-19 [Record Document 533]. McDowell \ntestified that, at times, he could see his own breath and that security did not provide \nblankets until after 4:00 p.m. McDowell Trial Tr. vol. IV at 1010:22-1011:7 [Record \nDocument 538]. \nii.  Social Isolation and Enforced Idleness \nMoving to the policies and practices in place on the South Compound, inmates on \nthe South Compound are deprived of nearly all meaningful human contact and receive \nlittle  to  no  mental  stimulation.38  The  evidence  showed  that  inmates  on  the  extended \nlockdown tiers and N-2D are regularly confined to their cell for twenty-three hours per \nday, Monday through Friday (with one hour for recreation and shower)39 and twenty-four \n \n38  Dr.  Haney  contrasted  meaningful  or  substantive  social  contact  with  incidental  or \nsuperficial  contact,  which  does  not  promote  social  connectivity.  Incidental  contact \nincludes  when  staff  passes  out  food  trays,  when  staff  conducts  pill  or  sick  call,  and \nfleeting “visual contact with another human being.” Haney Trial Tr. vol. XII at 2869:6-\n2871:8 [Record Document 553]. Dr. Haney described meaningful contact to be contact \nunimpeded by bars or walls; it is contact that permits inmates the possibility of forming a \nrelationship  or  bond  under  circumstances  unencumbered  by  the  stress  of  solitary \nconfinement and is considered more than simple routine contact. Haney Trial Tr. vol. XII \nat 2907-10 [Record Document 553]. \n39 Record Document Ex. J-3 at 7 [Record Document 564-285].  \n46 \n   \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 641   Filed 11/01/22   Page 47 of 165 PageID #: \n35273\nhours on the weekend; that inmates exercise alone in individual cages; that those on “yard \nrestriction” are confined to their cell for nearly twenty-four hours per day, except for fifty \nminutes of “yard time” in the recreation cages on Saturday or Sunday;40 that inmates eat \nevery meal in their cell; that inmates are denied all rehabilitative programming or out-of-\ncell classes;41 that inmates are only allowed noncontact visitation by telephone through a \nglass window;42 and that personal phone calls are limited to one ten-minute call per month \nat irregular intervals.43 The Courts also finds that, during the limited times inmates are \nallowed  outside,  they  are  confined  to  empty  cages  that  are  too  small  to  allow  for \nmeaningful physical activity.44 There is no recreational equipment in the cages, and there \nis no shade or covering in the cages to protect inmates from the elements. See Turner Trial \n \n40 Record Document 524 ¶ 36.  \n41 While on extended lockdown, inmates cannot partake in any programming, except for \nin-cell correspondence courses. Dauzat Trial Tr. vol. III at 775:7-10 [Record Document \n536].  One  packet  of  materials,  “Understanding  and  Reducing  Angry  Feelings,”  was \nidentified by Deputy Warden Dauzat as an item that can be provided to an individual upon \nrequest. Id. at 776:3-11; Ex. D-39 [Record Document 564-281]. This was the only packet \nof materials that was admitted into evidence. The cover page states that it is “a collection \nof materials for leading counseling sessions.” These written materials are inappropriate for \nanybody but the course instructor and are not consistent with many inmates’ reading \nlevels on extended lockdown. Burns Trial Tr. vol. V at 1284:7-24 [Record Document \n539]. \n42 Dr. Haney described the visitation room as having no privacy. Haney Trial Tr. vol. XII \nat 2912-13 [Record Document 553]. The picture of the visitation room shows three phones \non the wall. There are no partitions between the chairs or phones.  As such, whatever is \nbeing said can be heard by others. Id.; see Ex. P-GGG-227 [Record Document 564-201]. \n43 See Record Document 524 ¶ 37. Dr. Haney explained that the barriers to meaningful \nhuman contact on the tiers make the importance for maintaining family contact greater. \nDWCC, however, places additional barriers to family contact, such as only allowing one, \nten-minute phone call per month. Haney Trial Tr. vol. XII at 2910-12 [Record Document \n553].  \n44 As part of Dr. Haney’s testimony, he described several photographs of the outside \nrecreation cages. See Exs. P-GGG-02 [Record Document 564-183], P-GGG-73 [Record \nDocument 564-190], P-GGG-74 [Record Document 564-191].  \n47 \n   \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 641   Filed 11/01/22   Page 48 of 165 PageID #: \n35274\nTr. vol. I at 111:5-10 [Record Document 533]; McDowell Trial Tr. vol. IV at 1013:17-\n1014:3 [Record Document 538] (stating that he often skipped recreation because it was \ntoo hot); Record Document 524 ¶ 46 (stipulating that recreation typically occurs after \nlunch). \nAt DWCC, inmates on the extended lockdown tiers are allowed minimal personal \nbelongings to occupy their minds. Inmates are allowed one religious book, three other \nbooks or magazines, and some legal work for mental stimulation. Inmates also have very \nlimited access to the canteen—otherwise known as the commissary—for personal care \nitems, paper, flex pens, envelopes, and stamps. Record Document 524 ¶ 41. There are no \ntelevisions, radios, or crafts on the extended lockdown tiers.45 Id. ¶ 78.  \nTo  DWCC’s  credit,  at  some  point  in  this  litigation,  it  stopped  using  N-1  for \ndisciplinary and preventative segregation.46 Inmates on N-1 are now afforded more out-of-\ncell time and social contact. Inmates in N-1 eat in the common chow hall for each meal; \nthis equates to about twenty minutes of out-of-cell time three times per day. Goodwin \nTrial Tr. vol. XVIII at 4207:21-24 [Record Document 562]. Additionally, inmates housed \nin N-1 are allowed to use the recreation yard and the gymnasium rather than the small \nrecreation cages, and they are provided a phone call on a weekly basis. Record Document \n524 ¶ 45. Warden Goodwin also established through his testimony that inmates housed in \n \n45 Inmates on N-1 and N-2D have access to a television and radios. Record Document 524 \n¶ 38. Inmates do not have access to the television’s audio unless they are able to purchase \na radio from the commissary. Id. ¶ 40. \n46 It is important to note that at the time of the discovery cutoff date, these changes were \ninformal; they differ from the written policies submitted as evidence. At the remedy \nphase, the Court looks forward to hearing testimony about the formal changes \nimplemented and the effect of these changes. \n48 \n   \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 641   Filed 11/01/22   Page 49 of 165 PageID #: \n35275\nN-1 typically receive two hours of “yard time” Monday through Friday instead of the fifty \nminutes of yard time provided to inmates on the extended lockdown units. Goodwin Trial \nTr. vol. XVIII at 4207:10-16 [Record Document 562]. Further, inmates approaching the \nend  of  their  sentence  may  partake  in  reentry  courses  and  other  programming.  Id.  at \n4207:17-4210:21. Although N-1 is no longer used for disciplinary housing, it is still a \nrestrictive housing setting because inmates are segregated from general population and \nhave  their  privileges  greatly  reduced;  inmates  who  do  not  receive  “yard  time”  are \nregularly confined in their cell for twenty-three hours per day. Additionally, inmates who \nare not approaching the end of their sentence cannot partake in courses. \nIn sum, the conditions on N-1 through N-4 expose inmates to a substantial risk of \nharm by policies causing or related to social isolation, reduced environmental stimulation, \nand enforced idleness. Inmates on the extended lockdown tiers are isolated in extremely \nsmall cells for twenty-three to twenty-four hours per day in stark conditions with little to \nno positive stimulation. And inmates remain in these stark conditions indefinitely.  \niii.  Length of Time on Extended Lockdown  \nAs stated above, per policy, inmates remain in extended lockdown for an indefinite \nperiod, subject to a ninety-day review by the classification review board. DWCC creates \ncontinuous confinement reports detailing inmates who have been in extended lockdown \nhousing for longer than thirty days. Goodwin Trial Tr. vol. X at 2268:13-16 [Record \nDocument 544]. Warden Goodwin reviews these reports every month. Id. at 2270:13-\n2271:5.  \n49 \n   \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 641   Filed 11/01/22   Page 50 of 165 PageID #: \n35276\n  In reviewing the September 2019 report, DWCC had over 200 inmates in extended \nlockdown for over thirty days. See Ex. P-I-04 at 12-19 [Record Document 564-59]. When \nreviewing the various reports, there were many inmates who had spent years continuously \nin extended lockdown. See generally Ex. P-I-01 [Record Document 564-57], Ex. P-I-02 \n[Record Document 564-58], Ex. P-I-04 [Record Document 564-59]. Several examples \nshould suffice.  \nDamion Williams, Jackie Sampson, and Theron Nelson were housed in extended \nlockdown continuously for almost five years. Goodwin Trial Tr. vol. X at 2274:8-16, \n2287:1-6 [Record Document 544]. Matthew Carrol was in extended lockdown for over \nthree years. Id. at 2275:10-2276:4. Tyler Blanchard and Carlton Turner spent just short of \nthree  years  in  extended  lockdown.  Id.  at  2288:19-2289:3,  2298:21-2299:6.  These \nexamples are representative of the Class and show that many inmates spend months and, \nsometimes, years continuously in extended lockdown at DWCC. \niv.  Mentally Ill on the South Compound \nMany inmates in extended lockdown suffer from a mental illness. Hayden testified \nthat about twenty-eight to forty percent of the inmates on extended lockdown had a mental \nillness. Hayden Trial Tr. vol. II at 527:3-5 [Record Document 534]. Dr. Burns, Plaintiffs’ \nexpert,  and  Dr.  Thompson,  Defendants’  expert,  both  concurred  in  a  forty  percent \nprevalence rate for mental illness in restrictive housing at DWCC. Burns Trial Tr. vol. VI \nat 1427:23-1428:1 [Record Document 540]; see also Thompson Trial Tr. vol. XVII at \n4070:13-17 [Record Document 561]. Plaintiffs introduced evidence of many inmates with \nmental illnesses and serious mental illnesses, such as bipolar disorder, major depressive \n50 \n   \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 641   Filed 11/01/22   Page 51 of 165 PageID #: \n35277\ndisorder,  schizophrenia,  and  psychosis.  See,  e.g.,  Turner  Trial  Tr.  vol.  I    at  46:2-21 \n[Record Document 533]; Moran Trial Tr. vol. I at 197:1, 209:13-14 [Record Document \n533]; Solomon Trial Tr. vol. III at 593:7-595:17 [Record Document 536]; Adams Trial Tr. \nvol. IV at 951:24, 952:12, 957:9-960:6 [Record Document 538]; McDowell Trial Tr. vol. \nIV at 1012:12-13, 1030:14 [Record Document 538]; Doucet Dep. at 34:17, 35:22, 36:3-8, \n24:20-26:6, 30:22 [Record Document 563-5]. \nDr.  Burns  credibly  established  that  DWCC’s  mental  health  patients  “were \noverrepresented” on the South Compound and remained in restrictive housing for long \nperiods  of  time.  Burns  Trial  Tr.  vol.  VI  at  1427:14-19  [Record  Document  540]. \nAdditionally, inmates with mental illness find it extremely difficult to graduate out of \nextended lockdown because the severe conditions can lead to the activation or worsening \nof their symptoms. Id. at 1451; Haney Trial Tr. vol. XIII at 2947:14-2948:10 [Record \nDocument  554].  DWCC’s  security  staff  typically  treats  the  manifestations  of  these \nsymptoms as disobedience as opposed to symptoms of mental illness. As a result, inmates \nwith mental illness remain on extended lockdown for months and, sometimes, years and \nreturn cyclically when their symptoms recur. \nAccordingly, based on the concerning statistics and findings above, the Court must \nunfortunately conclude that DWCC utilizes extended lockdown as a depository for the \nmentally ill. And the conditions, as detailed above, only cause those inmates even more \npain and suffering, including the worsening of their mental illness.  \n51 \n   \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 641   Filed 11/01/22   Page 52 of 165 PageID #: \n35278\nv.  Discipline \nAs  stated  above,  inmates  could  be  placed  on  extended  lockdown  as  an  initial \nclassification  decision  upon  arrival  at  DWCC  or  as  a  sanction  handed  down  by  the \ndisciplinary board for a rule infraction. Goodwin Trial Tr. vol. XVIII at 4230:6-7 [Record \nDocument 562]; Thompson Trial Tr. vol. XVII at 4131:16-21 [Record Document 561]. \nInmates sentenced to isolation status must relinquish their mattress between 5:00 a.m. and \n9:00 p.m. As will be discussed in further detail below, the length of time an inmate spends \non extended lockdown is indefinite and subject to a ninety-day review by the classification \nreview board, which consists of the unit manager (security) and a classification officer. \nThe mental health department plays no role in either the classification or disciplinary \nprocess for inmates with mental illness.  \nDWCC also has an institutional practice of informally disciplining prisoners on \nextended lockdown. DWCC maintains an institution-specific policy, “Offender Posted \nPolicy 34,” which includes “strip cell status.” See Ex. P-JJJ-13 [Record Document 565-\n47]. The policy provides that an individual may be subjected to solitary confinement with \nno clothing other than a paper gown. Id. at 4. Additionally, an inmate on strip cell status is \nnot allowed any property or recreation time. Id. Per policy, inmates with a documented \npattern of behavior are not allowed a mattress outside of the hours of 9 p.m. to 5 a.m. \n(similar to isolation status). Id. at 5. Mattresses, however, are frequently not returned \ntimely, which results in inmates sleeping on the concrete bunk or metal rack. Solomon \nTrial Tr. vol. III at 607:2-608:5 [Record Document 536]; Brumfield Trial Tr. vol. I at \n52 \n   \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 641   Filed 11/01/22   Page 53 of 165 PageID #: \n35279\n179:25-180:3 [Record Document 533]. In essence, an inmate is naked in a cell—typically \na single cell—with nothing to do. Strip cell status is strictly punitive.  \nInmates with a documented pattern of behavior can be placed on strip cell status for \nan indefinite period with a review scheduled for every thirty days. Ex. P-JJJ-13 at 6 \n[Record Document 565-47]. Those behaviors include throwing human waste; throwing or \nhurling any bodily fluid or substance (including spitting); storing weapons, human feces, \nor urine in any form inside of his cell in a container; throwing any item from the cell at \nany person walking down the tier; throwing item(s) on the tier that might cause a safety \nhazard (soap, water, etc.); using belongings as a barricade or shield to prevent security \nfrom properly performing their duties; making threats of violence against another while in \nimmediate possession of any personal belonging that might be used as a weapon such as a \ncup, bar of soap, pen, pencil, etc.; flooding cells; committing an act of violence on another \nperson; and participating in a major disturbance. Id. at 3-4. The policy provides, “[s]trip \ncell status should be used as a last resort to protect lives and property.” Id. at 3. In reality, \ninmates are placed on strip cell status for actions that do not present an immediate threat to \nthe safety and security of the prison, such as merely throwing a cup on the tier. See Ex. P-\nS-04 [Record Document 564-75].  \nAdditionally, strip cell status can be renewed for additional periods of time; if an \nindividual receives a disciplinary infraction while on strip cell status, he could be given a \nbreak of no defined length and then placed back on strip cell. Nail Trial Tr. vol. VIII at \n1814:13-21 [Record Document 542]. Strip cell status is deployed against inmates with \nmental illness without any consultation with the mental health department. In fact, Hayden \n53 \n   \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 641   Filed 11/01/22   Page 54 of 165 PageID #: \n35280\ntestified that he is not familiar with Policy 34 or strip cell status. Hayden Trial Tr. vol. II \nat 387:4-6 [Record Document 534]. Although he has heard about the policy, he stated that \nit has nothing to do with the mental health department. Id. at 387:11-13. As such, he is not \nfamiliar with the conditions of strip cell status, that is, whether a person has a mattress, \nbecause he has not “reviewed the policy since it is not pertinent to [mental health].” Id. at \n387:14-20. The Court finds Hayden’s testimony incredible in this regard in that the strip \ncells are located on the tiers to which Hayden testified he makes at least weekly rounds. \nHayden’s “blind eye” to the conditions of strip cell status defines deliberate indifference.  \nOnly the Unit Manager of the South Compound, the duty officer, or a warden can \napprove putting an inmate on strip cell status. Nail Trial Tr. vol. VIII at 1813:3-4 [Record \nDocument 542]. Before her retirement, Deputy Warden Huff, in her capacity as duty \nofficer, signed off on uses of strip cell status. Huff Trial Tr. vol. IX at 1939:1-9 [Record \nDocument 543]. Deputy Warden Huff would approve the use of strip cell status after \nasking  security  what  the  person  did,  whether  the  person  has  a  pattern  of  behavioral \nproblems, and how long it had been since the last behavioral issue. Id. at 1947:22-1948:1. \nDeputy Warden Huff asserted that during her entire tenure as assistant warden, she was \nnot responsible for investigating an incident prior to approving the use of strip cell status, \nnor did she ever investigate any incident prior to imposing strip cell status. Id. at 1947:6-\n18. Instead, she relied on the representations of the notifying officer. See id. at 1948:6-22. \nIf  the  Deputy  Warden  was  not  responsible  for  investigating  incidents  and  her  only \nfunction was to rubberstamp the officer’s representations, the Court questions why DWCC \n54 \n   \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 641   Filed 11/01/22   Page 55 of 165 PageID #: \n35281\npolicy required her approval. Deputy Warden Huff’s “hands off” attitude as to strip cell \nstatus further illustrates the deliberate indifference of the institution.  \nStrip cell status is imposed outside of the scope of any regular disciplinary process. \nColeman Trial Tr. vol. VII at 1626:19-23 [Record Document 541]; Nail Trial Tr. vol. XIII \nat  1812:11-24  [Record  Document  554].  It  is  imposed  without  a  hearing  and  is  not \nreviewed by the disciplinary board; it is imposed fully at the discretion of staff. Nail Trial \nTr. vol. XIII at 1816:9-24 [Record Document 554]. This practice deviates from nationally \naccepted standards regarding informal discipline. Pacholke Trial Tr. vol. XII at 2728:10-\n18 [Record Document 553].  \nPolicy 34 was approved by Chief Smith as a delegation of authority from Secretary \nLeBlanc on behalf of the DOC. LeBlanc Trial Tr. vol. XI at 2596:9-16 [Record Document \n545]. Because Policy 34 occurs outside of the disciplinary process, it is untouched by the \nDefendants’ imposition of a new disciplinary and classification system in December 2019 \nand remains in place.  \nInmates testified that strip cell status had a profound impact on their mental state, \nleading to increased feelings of depression and sadness. Solomon Trial Tr. vol. III at \n608:16-609:7 [Record Document 536]; see Brumfield Trial Tr. vol. I at 180:7-14 [Record \nDocument 533]. Christopher Solomon, who had been placed on strip cell status multiple \ntimes, testified that the experience left him uncomfortable and bruised from sleeping on \nconcrete  for  twenty  to  thirty  days.  Solomon  Trial  Tr.  vol.  III  at  605:1-13  [Record \nDocument 536]. \n55 \n   \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 641   Filed 11/01/22   Page 56 of 165 PageID #: \n35282\nSecretary  Pacholke  testified  that  based  on  his  thirty  years  of  experience  in \ncorrections, touring  many prisons throughout his  career  and his understanding of the \nAmerican Correctional Association standards, the generally accepted standard regarding \nthe  provision  of  clothing  for  people  in  restrictive  housing  is  that  it  is  a  right,  not  a \nprivilege. Pacholke Trial Tr. vol. XII at 2729:10-2730:3 [Record Document 553]. The \nconditions  under  strip  cell  status  deviate  from  the  national  standard  regarding  giving \nclothing to prisoners in that no clothing or personal property is permitted, except for a \npaper gown. Id. at 2730:4-16.  \nUpchurch, Defendants’ own expert, stated that in his professional opinion, the fact \nthat strip cell status can be used in thirty-day increments is inconsistent with corrections \npractices today. Upchurch Trial Tr. vol. XIV at 3256:5-9 [Record Document 555]. He \nbelieves that there should be a meaningful review no longer than seventy-two hours after a \nperson is placed on strip cell status. Id. at 3256:12-3257:2. Upchurch also believes that, \nfor an inmate with mental illness, there should be an assessment done by a mental health \nprofessional within twenty-four hours of implementing strip cell status to determine if the \nperson’s behaviors are because of mental illness, or rather, an act of aggression. See id. at \n3257:10-3259:20. Dr. Thompson, Defendants’ other expert, concurred that  the mental \nhealth  department  should  be  involved  in  any  decision  to  deploy  strip  cell  status. \nThompson Trial Tr. vol. XVII at 4057:19-4058:1 [Record Document 561]. \nIn sum, all experts agree that DWCC’s use of strip cell status violates modern \ncorrectional practices and minimum standards and recommend that DWCC substantially \nreform or eliminate the practice. Indeed, the Court finds that DWCC’s use of strip cell \n56 \n   \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 641   Filed 11/01/22   Page 57 of 165 PageID #: \n35283\nstatus—without  any  involvement  by  the  mental  health  department  and  in  thirty-day \nincrements without a formal review—serves to inflict mental and physical torture. As \nimplemented at DWCC, inmates are deprived of all property and clothed in a mere paper \ngown,  which  in  the  wintertime,  leaves  them  exposed  to  extremely  cold  conditions.47 \nAdditionally, inmates suffer physical harm, such as bruising, from sleeping on concrete \nfor prolonged periods. Although Defendants cite to other courts that have found that strip \ncell status for shorter periods, such as twenty-four hours, did not violate constitutional \nstandards,48  the  Court  concludes  that  DWCC’s  particular  use  of  strip  cell  status  is \ndistinguishable. Here, the length of time an inmate is placed on strip cell status, the lack of \nany possessions, the lack of clothing, the lack of bedding, and the failure of the mental \nhealth  staff  to  conduct  periodic  inmate  reviews—constitutes  cruel  and  unusual \npunishment.       \n(c)  Manifestation of Harm at DWCC \nThe harm suffered by inmates in solitary confinement is not merely theoretical. \nDuring his inmate interviews, Dr. Haney observed that inmates were manifesting signs \nand symptoms consistent with the harms associated with prolonged periods in solitary \nconfinement. Dr. Haney summarized his findings as follows: \n \n47  According  to  multiple  inmates,  DWCC  security  engages  in  a  form  of  corporal \npunishment called “bluesing.” Bluesing refers to placing an inmate in a paper gown in the \nwinter (for suicide watch or strip cell) and then opening the tier windows to expose \ninmates to freezing temperatures. The Court, however, finds that Plaintiffs have failed to \nprove a widespread practice of intentional bluesing.  \n48 See James v. LeBlanc, No. 09-CV-1592, 2011 WL 6842516, *7-8 (W.D. La. Nov. 16, \n2011), report and recommendation adopted, No. 09-CV-1592, 2011 WL 6842512 (W.D. \nLa. Dec. 29, 2011) (citing various cases).  \n57 \n   \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 641   Filed 11/01/22   Page 58 of 165 PageID #: \n35284\nThe prisoners [on the South Compound] are manifesting the signs and the \nsymptoms that are consistent with exactly what the literature shows about \nthe harmful effects of solitary confinement. They report suffering. They \nappear to be suffering. They report not just suffering in general but they \nidentify a number of the dimensions of suffering and the dimensions of the \nharm that they’re experiencing, again, consistent with what the literature \ntells us, my own research, and the research of other people happens to \npeople when they’re in severe conditions of solitary confinement.  \n \nHaney Trial Tr. vol. XII at 2866:8-18 [Record Document 553]. Specifically, he observed \nthat  some  inmates  were  unable  to  communicate  with  him  at  all  and  were  exhibiting \nobvious states of distress, such as shaking. Id. at 2895:9-18. Dr. Haney described one \ninmate on suicide watch who could not even tell Dr. Haney his name. Id. at 2993:25-\n2996:5. Dr. Haney testified that inmates, with and without diagnosed mental illnesses, \noverwhelmingly  reported  experiencing  severe  depression,  desperation,  anxiety, \nhallucinations, cognitive impairments, ruminations, and feelings of impending breakdown. \nId. at 2962:8-2964:25. Defendants could not contradict this testimony.  \n2.  Deliberate Indifference  \nAs  stated  above,  in  addition  to  proving  that  officials’  actions  put  inmates  at \nsubstantial risk of serious harm, Plaintiffs must also demonstrate that correction officials \nhad a subjectively culpable state of mind—that is,  they  were  deliberately indifferent. \nPlaintiffs can carry that burden by showing that Defendants had subjective knowledge of \nthe risk of harm and then failed to take reasonable steps to abate such harm. Additionally, \nthe mere fact that a risk was obvious is sufficient to infer deliberate indifference. Cook, \n376 F.3d at 340. Deliberate indifference can be established if evidence is presented that \nproves that the substantial risk of a particular action was “longstanding, pervasive, well-\n58 \n   \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 641   Filed 11/01/22   Page 59 of 165 PageID #: \n35285\ndocumented, or expressly noted by prison officials in the past, and the circumstances \nsuggest that the defendant-official being sued had been exposed to information concerning \nthe risk and thus ‘must have known’ about it.” Farmer, 511 U.S. at 842-43 (internal \nquotation marks and citations omitted). \nThe Court finds, based on the evidence detailed above, that correctional officials \nare aware of the harsh conditions on the South Compound and the resulting psychological \npain experienced by inmates. In fact, Secretary LeBlanc testified that, “Chief Smith and I \nhad a goal of being out of the restrictive housing business by the middle of this year. But \nthat has been . . . put aside because of COVID, hurricanes.” LeBlanc Trial Tr. vol. XVIII \nat 4437:24-4438:3 [Record Document 562]. Clearly, the DOC is aware of the harm caused \nby restricted housing. Nevertheless, DWCC and the DOC continue to house inmates for \ntwenty-three or more hours per day in their cell with very little meaningful social contact \nor mental stimulation. The composition of the tiers on the South Compound was designed \nto cause social isolation, environmental deprivations, and enforced idleness. The policies \nand practices in place were approved by Warden Goodwin, Chief Smith, and/or Secretary \nLeBlanc, which includes Policy 34 and strip cell status. Additionally, the record is replete \nwith examples of inmates submitting ARP grievances regarding the stark conditions of \nconfinement and the resulting psychological harm it is causing them. Huff Trial Tr. vol. \nIX at 1997:22-1999:8 [Record Document 543]; Adams Trial Tr. vol. IV at 976:21-977:19 \n[Record Document 538]; Turner Trial Tr. vol. I at 66:2-68:8 [Record Document 533]. \nDespite this knowledge, neither DWCC officials nor DOC officials made any effort to \ninvestigate  the  conditions  or  determine  whether  the  conditions  were,  in  fact,  causing \n59 \n   \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 641   Filed 11/01/22   Page 60 of 165 PageID #: \n35286\ninmates to experience psychological pain. And, in some instances, DWCC officials and \nstaff displayed willful blindness to the very conditions confronting them on a daily or \nweekly  basis.  The  callous  disregard  for  the  inmates’  mental  well-being  constitutes \ndeliberate indifference. See Johnson, 37 F. Supp. 2d at 913-15.  \n3.  Conclusion as to the Conditions of Confinement \nThe Court finds that Plaintiffs have satisfied both the objective and subjective \ncomponents  of  the  Eighth  Amendment  inquiry.  Plaintiffs  proved  that  the  conditions, \npolicies, and practices in place  on the South Compound constitute cruel and unusual \npunishment and that Defendants have been deliberately indifferent in housing inmates \nunder such conditions without taking any reasonable steps to alleviate the conditions in \nviolation of the Eighth Amendment. The evidence shows that inmates are deprived of \nbasic  psychological  needs  through  policies  and  practices  related  to  social  isolation, \nenforced idleness, severe mental deprivation, and indefinite exposure to such conditions.  \nThe Court finds that the conditions, as detailed above, have the mutually enforcing \neffect of depriving individuals of basic mental health needs and exposing them to mental \ntorture.49 See Cook, 376 F.3d at 333 (citation omitted). Specifically, the Court finds that \nDWCC’s practice of housing inmates continuously for months and years in extremely \nsmall cells for twenty-three to twenty-four hours per day with little to no meaningful \nhuman contact, mental stimulation, and exercise, combined with DWCC’s use of strip cell \n \n49 Although certain conditions and practices may individually constitute cruel and unusual \npunishment, the Court need not make such determination at this time because it finds that \nthe conditions and practices, as detailed above, have the mutually enforcing effect of \ndepriving  inmates  of  a single, identifiable  human need: mental  health. See  Alberti  v. \nKlevenhagen, 790 F.2d 1220, 1225 (5th Cir. 1986). \n60 \n   \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 641   Filed 11/01/22   Page 61 of 165 PageID #: \n35287\nstatus  in  thirty-day  increments  (or  longer),  cause  extreme  psychological  pain  and \nsuffering. Furthermore, the Court finds that DWCC unconstitutionally utilizes extended \nlockdown to house the mentally ill for indefinite periods, which only serves to worsen \ntheir  mental  illness  and  exposes  those  inmates  to  even  greater  pain  and  suffering. \nDefendants have shown a wanton disregard for the mental health of the inmates on the \nSouth Compound. Accordingly, Plaintiffs are entitled to further relief to alleviate the \nunlawful conditions.  \nD.  Delivery of Mental Health Services  \nPlaintiffs also claim that DWCC fails to deliver adequate mental health services to \ninmates on the South Compound. In Estelle v. Gamble, the Supreme Court held that \n“deliberate indifference to a prisoner’s serious illness or injury states a cause of action \nunder  §  1983”  because  it  “constitutes  the  unnecessary  and  wanton  infliction  of  pain \nproscribed by the Eighth Amendment.” 429 U.S. 97, 104-05 (1976) (internal quotation \nmarks  and  citation  omitted).  The  inquiry  is  whether  Defendants  were  “deliberately \nindifferen[t] to serious medical needs.” Id. at 104.   \n “Medical treatment that is merely unsuccessful or negligent does not constitute \ndeliberate indifference, nor does a prisoner’s disagreement with his medical treatment, \nabsent exceptional circumstances.” Arenas, 922 F.3d at 620 (internal quotation marks and \ncitations omitted). “Rather, an inmate must show that the officials refused to treat him, \nignored his complaints, intentionally treated him incorrectly, or engaged in any similar \nconduct that would clearly evince a wanton disregard for any serious medical needs.” Id. \nat 620-21 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).   \n61 \n   \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 641   Filed 11/01/22   Page 62 of 165 PageID #: \n35288\nSystemic  deficiencies  in  a  prison’s  mental  healthcare  system  could  support  a \nfinding of deliberate indifference at the institutional level. See Cook, 376 F.3d at 333 \n(“Conditions  of  confinement  may  establish  an  Eighth  Amendment  violation  ‘in \ncombination’ when each would not do so alone, but only when they have a mutually \nenforcing  effect  that  produces  the  deprivation  of  a  single,  identifiable  human  need.” \n(citation omitted)). Plaintiffs can meet their burden by showing “repeated examples of \nnegligent acts which disclose a pattern of conduct by the prison medical staff . . . or by \nproving there are such systemic and gross deficiencies in staffing, facilities, equipment, or \nprocedures that the inmate population is effectively denied access to adequate medical \ncare.” Ramos v. Lamm, 639 F.2d 559, 575 (10th Cir. 1980) (citations omitted). \n1.  Systemic Deficiencies  \n“The components of a minimally adequate mental health treatment program may be \nascertained by resort to judicial precedent in previous prison cases, by consideration of the \nexpert testimony in the instant case, and by applying the basic principles of minimally \nadequate care to the specific problem of mental health care.” Ruiz v. Estelle, 503 F. Supp. \n1265, 1339 (S.D. Tex. 1980). Ruiz identified the minimum criteria required for mental \nhealth care as: systematic screening and evaluation; treatment that is more than mere \nseclusion or  close supervision; participation by trained mental health professionals in \nappropriate numbers; safeguards against psychotropic medications that are prescribed in \ndangerous  amounts,  without  adequate  supervision  or  otherwise  inappropriately \nadministered;  accurate,  complete  and  confidential  records;  and  a  suicide  prevention \nprogram. Id.  \n62 \n   \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 641   Filed 11/01/22   Page 63 of 165 PageID #: \n35289\nDr. Burns testified to these basic principles of minimally adequate care in the \ncontext of mental health programs in correctional facilities. When speaking to DWCC’s \ncompliance  with  these  industry  standards,  Dr.  Burns  relied  on  a  variety  of  sources, \nincluding:  \n .  .  .  [P]hysician  statements  in  the  World  Health  Organization,  the \nAssociation of State Correctional Administrators. That was in 2013. The \nDepartment of Justice who issued a report about restrictive housing in the \nUnited States. That was in 2016. The World Health Organization talking \nabout  solitary  confinement  as  a  prison  health  issue  is  from  2014.  The \nNational Commission on Correctional Health Care Statement was adopted \nin  April  of  2016.  The  American  Psychiatric  Association  was  in  2012, \npolicy position statement. And then the American Correctional Association \nas standards for the delivery of mental health care in correctional settings, \nthose standards were adopted in August of 2018 with an effective date, \nactually,  of  October  1st,  2020,  but  when  they  were  adopted  and  the \neffective date there were no changes. \nBurns Trial Tr. vol. V at 1261:11-1262:2 [Record Document 539]. Dr. Burns’s extensive \nexperience in providing mental health care in the prison context and her consulting work, \nimpressive academic and professional background, and ability to clearly and succinctly \nexplain her reasoning and understanding  of mental health care treatment  made  her a \ncredible and reliable expert witness. The Court will rely on Dr. Burns’s explanation of the \nminimum standard of care within the industry when relevant.  \nAs detailed below, DWCC fails each category, which results in a systemic failure \nto deliver adequate mental health care to inmates on the South Compound.  \n(a)  Screening and Evaluation \nThe  Court  finds  that  the  evidence  at  trial  showcased  systemic  deficiencies  in \nDWCC’s  screening  and  evaluation  of  inmates.  Screening  and  evaluating  inmates  for \n63 \n   \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 641   Filed 11/01/22   Page 64 of 165 PageID #: \n35290\nmental illness is one aspect of providing sufficient mental health care. At DWCC, there \nare three opportunities to screen an inmate: 1) during intake; 2) during mental health \nrounds; and 3) during periodic evaluations. The Court will address each in turn.  \ni.  Screening and Evaluation During Intake \nInmates  that  arrive  at  DWCC  are  either  inter-system  or  intra-system  transfer \ninmates. See Hayden Trial Tr. vol. XVI at 3555:3-7 [Record Document 560]. Inter-system \ntransfer inmates are those that are new intakes into the prison system. See id. at 3555:11-\n12. These are rarer, as DWCC is not designated to act as a reception center. See Ex. J-5 at \n1 [Record Document 565-15]. Intra-system transfers are inmates who are being transferred \nfrom  one  facility  to  another.  See  Hayden  Trial  Tr.  vol.  XVI  at  3555:11-12  [Record \nDocument  560].  Most  inmates  that  arrive  at  DWCC  are  intra-system  transfers  from \nEHCC. See id. at 3555:14-24. Both inter-system and intra-system transfers require some \nlevel of mental health screening upon arrival to DWCC, per policy. See Ex. J-5 at 7 \n[Record  Document  565-15].  This  is  because  an  individual’s  mental  health  status  can \nchange between screenings, even if one was recently performed at an institution like \nEHCC. Burns Trial Tr. vol. V at 1276:5-1277:8 [Record Document 539].50 For both intra-\nsystem and inter-system transfers, initial mental health screening is typically conducted by \nmental health staff immediately upon an individual’s arrival to the facility. See Ex. J-5 at 7 \n \n50 In her testimony, Dr. Burns explains the different reasons why an individual’s mental \nhealth might change between intake screenings. Those include, but are not limited to, the \nreceipt of bad news from home, difficulty coping with extended restrictive housing, \nfeelings of social isolation from friends and family, the presence of a new mental illness \n(such as schizophrenia) which will manifest at a certain age, and inconsistencies with the \nconsumption of medication. See Burns Trial Tr. vol. V at 1276:5-1277:8 [Record \nDocument 539].  \n64 \n   \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 641   Filed 11/01/22   Page 65 of 165 PageID #: \n35291\n[Record Document 565-15]. However, if intake occurs on a weekend or outside of the \nmental health department’s normal business hours, DWCC policy states that a “qualified \nhealth care provider completing the medical screen will also complete the mental health \nscreen . . . and forward to Mental Health.” Id. at 2-3.  \nIntra-system transfers go through a different process. DWCC has a policy that \nspecifically  enumerates  the  three  overarching  goals  an  intra-system  mental  health \nscreening is meant to accomplish: ask the inmate a list of questions, document a series of \nobservations about the inmate, and assign the inmate a disposition. Id. at 7. The following \nlist  enumerates  the  exact  questions  each  mental  health  screening  should  include,  per \nDWCC policy:  \n1. If the offender is being treated for mental health problems[.] \n2. If the offender is presently prescribed psychotropic medication. \n3. If the offender has a current mental health complaint. \n4. If the offender has present suicide [sic] ideation[.] \n5. If the offender has a history of suicidal behavior[.] \n  6. If the offender has a history of inpatient and outpatient psychiatric \n    treatment[.] \n7. If the offender has a history of substance abuse. \nId. Mental health staff must also document any observations they make pertaining to “1) \ngeneral  appearance  and  behavior,  2)  evidence  of  abuse  and/or  trauma,  3)  current \nsymptoms of psychosis, depression, anxiety, and/or aggression.” Id. Finally, the mental \nhealth staff will determine whether the inmate is sent to general population (with or \nwithout referral for follow-up with mental health) or referred for emergency mental health \ntreatment. Id. at 7.  \n65 \n   \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 641   Filed 11/01/22   Page 66 of 165 PageID #: \n35292\n   Hayden walked the Court through the steps he takes when completing an intra-\nsystem mental health screening. The process begins with Hayden observing the inmates as \nthey get off the bus that transported them to DWCC. Hayden Trial Tr. vol. XVI at 3557:7-\n17 [Record Document 560]. Intra-system transfers arrive at the facility with their records, \nwhich are directly loaded into “medical.” Id. at 3563:20-23. Hayden then individually \nobserves each inmate as they make it through the security process. Id. at 3557:18-20. At \nthe  top  of  an  intra-system  inmate’s  mental  health  screening  form  is  a  series  of  pre-\npopulated  background  information  from  the  CAJUN  database,  including  the  “Mental \nHealth  Code  Upon  Arrival.”  Id.  at  3559:3-12;  see  also,  e.g.,  Ex.  D-59  at  1  [Record \nDocument 565-27]. Those codes are “SH” or suicidal history, “DD” or developmental \ndisability, “SA” or substance abuse, “SX” or designation as an adjudicated sex offender, \n“AX” or Axis I diagnosis (which means a diagnosis of a mental health condition that may \nbe treated by medication), “PM” or current prescription of psychotropic medications, and \n“LOC”  to  designate  which  Level  of  Care  this  individual  was  identified  as  requiring. \nHayden Trial Tr. vol. II at 354:5-355:21 [Record Document 534]. There is also a label \nafter those codes to indicate their applicability to the inmate. “P” stands for present, \nindicating that the individual has that classification, “d” stands for dependency, and “x” \nstands for “none indicated.” See id. at 354:8-13. Hayden testified that he then notes any \nobservations regarding behavior and intelligence and will conduct a “verbal interview,” \nwhere he asks questions about past and present suicidal ideation/behavior and current \nmental  health  symptoms.  See  Hayden  Trial  Tr.  vol.  XVI  at  3564:8-3565:12  [Record \nDocument 560]; see also, e.g., Ex. D-59 at 1 [Record Document 565-27].

Hayden Trial Tr. vol. II at 356:1-3 [Record Document 534]. \nHayden then testified that he will only refer an inmate to Dr. Seal for further consultation \nif he finds that there are “red flags,” like a present mental health diagnosis or prescription \nof  psychotropic  medications.  Hayden  Trial  Tr.  vol.  XVI  at  3569:11-3570:16  [Record \nDocument 560]. Hayden generally refers all patients to general population, regardless of \ntheir level of care, Hayden Trial Tr. vol. II at 385:7-13 [Record Document 534]; however, \nit is the classification review board, a group with no mental health staff involvement, that \nultimately decides where an inmate is housed. See Dauzat Trial Tr. vol. III at 757:25-\n758:24 [Record Document 536].  \n  There  are  several  issues  with  the  intra-system  intake  screening  and  evaluation \nprocesses at DWCC. First, Hayden is not qualified to conduct the intra-system mental \nhealth intake screenings because he does not have the education or training required to \nconduct IQ testing or psychological examinations. Burns Trial Tr., vol. V at 1285:24-\n1286:2 [Record Document 539].51 In order for Hayden to be qualified to conduct the intra-\nsystem  intake  assessments,  he  needs  additional  training;  mentorship;  and  regular, \nthorough, and timely reviews of his intake screenings by Deputy Warden Dauzat. See \nBurns  Trial  Tr.  vol.  V  at  1298:21-1299:5  [Record  Document  539].  As  previously \nmentioned, Hayden’s degree is in industrial psychology, which he describes as a “science \n \n51 Though Dr. Thompson disagrees that Hayden is unqualified to perform these \nscreenings, he did concede that “[h]e does not have an LCSW or a license, and you know, \nyou would prefer to have that, if you could have it.” Thompson Trial Tr. vol. XVII at \n3985:19-23 [Record Document 561].  \n67 \n   \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 641   Filed 11/01/22   Page 68 of 165 PageID #: \n35294\nand research-based degree” that “appl[ies] . . . psychological principles into work and \ngroup settings.” Hayden Trial Tr. vol. II at 315:20-316:4 [Record Document 534]. His \ndegree is not clinical, nor is it specific to the prison context. Though it is a psychology \ndegree, the type of psychology is irrelevant to his job. Without the proper education, and \nwithout audit or regular oversight from a qualified professional, it is inappropriate for \nHayden to be conducting these intra-system health screenings.  \nThere are two examples that demonstrate how Hayden’s lack of proper education \nand training affects his ability to treat inmates. The first example was when Hayden \nchanged an inmate diagnosis by Dr. Seal. On an “Offender Progress Notes” page for \ninmate T.H.52 dated February 4, 2016, Dr. Seal noted that the patient had schizoaffective \ndisorder.  Ex. P-LL-244 [Record Document 564-129]; accord Hayden Trial Tr. vol. III at \n561:16-19  [Record  Document  536].  That  same  day,  Hayden  filled  out  a  “Psychiatric \nClinical  Assessment  Form”  and  listed  the  inmate’s  diagnosis  as  “MDD”  or  major \ndepressive disorder. Ex. P-LL-245 [Record Document 564-130]; accord Hayden Trial Tr. \nvol. III at 560:19-23 [Record Document 536]. When confronted with the discrepancies \nbetween these two forms, Hayden argued with counsel, stating that it is difficult to read \nDr. Seal’s notes. Id. at 564:9-12. However, even though some of the note is illegible, the \nCourt  was  able  to  identify  a  diagnosis  of  schizoaffective  disorder,  along  with  the \nmedications the inmate was prescribed. Illegibility is not an excuse for misdiagnosis. As \nDr. Burns explained, this “is a problem when the people who are responsible for providing \n \n52 This is inmate T.H. Out of respect to the sensitive nature of this discussion and the \ninformation it reveals therein, the inmate’s name will not be disclosed here. \n68 \n   \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 641   Filed 11/01/22   Page 69 of 165 PageID #: \n35295\ntreatment don’t understand psychiatric symptoms, psychiatric diagnoses, and what sorts of \ntreatment  interventions  that  might  be  indicated.”  Burns  Trial  Tr.  vol.  V  at  1304:1-5 \n[Record Document 539].   \nHayden’s lack of credentials was also visible in Ex. P-LL-287 [Record Document \n564-137],  which  is  a  mental  health  progress  note.  The  mental  health  progress  note \nindicates that the inmate was “[o]riented to: xX1” and the clinical note states, “when seen \nhe  lacked  orientation  to  his  surroundings  and  was  unable  to  converse  gainfully  with \nclinician. Discontinue M[ental] H[ealth] O[bservation].” Id. During his testimony, Hayden \nconfirmed the information on the exhibit; he did note that the inmate was “oriented to \ntimes one” and that he removed the inmate from mental health observation. Hayden Trial \nTr. vol. II at 420:20-421:8 [Record Document 534]. Hayden stated that “oriented times \none” means that an inmate is “only able to correctly answer one of my questions . . . do \nyou  know  what  today’s  date  is,  do  you  know  the  month,  and  do  you  know  who  is \npresident.” Id. at 412:12-20. He further testified that an individual being “oriented x one” \ndoes not necessarily mean that an individual is “grossly disoriented.”53 Id. at 418:10-19. \nDeputy Warden Dauzat described “oriented times one” as meaning that the inmate was \n“oriented to one of the factors that is used to assess his orientation . . . basically person, \nplace,  surroundings,  the  environment.”  Dauzat  Trial  Tr.  vol.  III  at  755:3-7  [Record \nDocument 536].  \n \n53 Hayden described “grossly disoriented” to be “if they are not able to even recognize \ntheir surroundings whatsoever, if . . . they can’t even sit on their bed . . . they are starting \nto lose all levels of functioning.” Hayden Trial Tr. vol. II at 418:10-15 [Record Document \n534].  \n69 \n   \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 641   Filed 11/01/22   Page 70 of 165 PageID #: \n35296\nDr.  Burns  was  present  for  Hayden’s  testimony  discussing  the  “oriented  x” \ndesignations on various mental health assessments and progress forms. Burns Trial Tr. \nvol. V at 1323:9-12 [Record Document 539]. Dr. Burns opined that Hayden’s testimony \nwas demonstrative of a lack of familiarity with medical convention. Id. at 1323:24-1324:6. \nThis  is  because  Hayden’s  understanding  of  “oriented  times  one”  is  inconsistent  with \nmedical convention, which defines this as a person who remembers only his name, but not \nthe date, time, or where they are. Id. at 1323:16-23. Dr. Burns stated that an inmate being \nable to remember only his name is concerning because “it is the first thing you learn and it \nis the last thing that you forget.” Id. at 1323:22-23. According to Dr. Burns, failing to \nmake a note of which questions an inmate was unable to answer is problematic and \nindicative of  Hayden’s  incomprehension of the purpose  of the line of questioning in \ngeneral. Id. at 1324:3-6.  \nAdditionally, the actual intra-system screenings and corresponding documentation \nare wholly inadequate. During her testimony, Dr. Burns walked the court through two \ndifferent intra-system transfer records, id. at 1289:11-13, 1294:9-11, which illustrated the \ndeficiencies in the general intake process at DWCC. Burns Trial Tr. vol. V at 1297:18-21 \n[Record Document 539]. Her criticism included the form used; the way the form was \nfilled out; the inadequacy of the screening’s questioning process; the lack of meaningful \nreview by a qualified individual; and the lack of meaningful and prompt follow-up.  \n70 \n   \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 641   Filed 11/01/22   Page 71 of 165 PageID #: \n35297\nShe first examined Ex. P-DD-01 [Record Document 564-108].54 Id. at 1289:8-10. \nThis inmate’s mental health intake screening showed a diagnosis of schizophrenia and the \nprescription of the psychotropic medications Haldol and Depakote. Id. at 1289:14-20; see \nalso Ex. P-DD-01 [Record Document 564-108]. The prepopulated CAJUN information \nalso indicated that there was a present indication of a history of suicide, substance abuse \n“dependency,”  a  present  Axis  I  diagnosis,  a  present  prescription  of  psychotropic \nmedication, and a “LOC-3” designation. See Burns Trial Tr. vol. V at 1290:25-1291:8 \n[Record Document 539]; accord Ex. P-DD-01 [Record Document 564-108]. However, \nHayden’s assessment showed the inmate to be completely within normal limits (“WNL”). \nSee Burns Trial Tr. vol. V at 1290:13-17 [Record Document 539]; accord Ex. P-DD-01 \n[Record Document 564-108]. Dr. Burns  also  highlighted the inconsistency that, upon \narrival, the inmate is listed as having a history of suicidal behavior, whereas the form \nindicates that he has no current presence or history of suicidal ideation. See Burns Trial \nTr. vol. V at 1290:3-1291:12 [Record Document 539]; see also Ex. P-DD-01 [Record \nDocument 564-108]. Furthermore, the form does not reflect that any follow-up questions \nwere asked or that there was any attempt in the assessment to resolve this disparity. See \nBurns Trial Tr. vol. V at 1291:12 [Record Document 539]; see also Ex. P-DD-01 [Record \nDocument  564-108].  For  example,  with  regard  to  the  inconsistency  in  the  history  of \nsuicide,  Dr. Burns indicated that it would  have been necessary  to have asked “some \n \n54 This is inmate B.C. This individual submitted a waiver to allow his medical and mental \nhealth records to be admitted into evidence and utilized during this case. However, out of \nrespect to the sensitive nature of this discussion and the information it reveals therein, the \ninmate’s name will not be disclosed here. \n71 \n   \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 641   Filed 11/01/22   Page 72 of 165 PageID #: \n35298\nquestions about what happened in the past, what helped, what hurt, how were you feeling \nnow, are there plans for the future,” in order to have a more comprehensive understanding \nof the inmate’s current mental state. See Burns Trial Tr. vol. V at 1290:11-13 [Record \nDocument 539]. Dr. Burns also noted that the mental health referral box was unchecked. \nId. at 1291:21-22. Instead, there was a simple statement by Deputy Warden Dauzat to \n“follow-up per policy.”  Id. at 1291:23-25.  \nDr. Burns stated that this is not an adequate plan and that the lack of follow-up is of \nconcern. Id. She noted that “schizophrenia itself has [a] mortality rate for suicide of about \nten  percent,  and  so  it  is  a  high-risk  disorder  .  .  .  you  would  want  some  additional \ninformation about the past attempts, how many, how serious, did it require treatment and \nalso, some assessment of [current] risk factors.” See Burns Trial Tr. vol. V at 1292:17-23 \n[Record Document 539]. The failure of adequate screening poses a serious risk of harm to \nthe  inmate,  including  risk  of  suicide,  self-harm,  assault,  behavioral  issues,  and  the \nnoncompliance with medication (and subsequent destabilization). See id. at 1293:7-19.  \nDr. Burns then examined Ex. P-O-30 [Record Document 564-70].55 The inmate’s \nprepopulated CAJUN information indicated that there was a present indication of a history \nof  suicide,  substance  abuse  “dependency,”  a  present  Axis  I  diagnosis,  a  present \nprescription of psychotropic medication, and a “LOC-4f” designation. See Ex. P-O-30 \n[Record Document 564-70]. Dr. Burns noted that at the time, the inmate’s diagnosis was \n \n55 This is inmate C.A. This individual submitted a waiver to allow his medical and mental \nhealth records to be admitted into evidence and utilized during this case. However, out of \nrespect to the sensitive nature of this discussion and the information it reveals therein, the \ninmate’s name will not be disclosed here.  \n72 \n   \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 641   Filed 11/01/22   Page 73 of 165 PageID #: \n35299\nlisted as a “psychotic disorder not otherwise specified.” See Burns Trial Tr. vol. V at \n1294:6-11 [Record Document 539]; see also Ex. P-O-30 [Record Document 564-70]. \nAdditionally, the record indicated a history of multiple suicide attempts, a history of the \ninmate cutting himself, the prescription of three psychotropic medications (Wellbutrin, \nZyprexa,  and  Haldol),  and  a  change  in  the  inmate’s  LOC  to  LOC-3  upon  arrival  at \nDWCC. See Burns Trial Tr. vol. V at 1295:3-16 [Record Document 539]; see also Ex. P-\nO-30 [Record Document 564-70]. Other than the change in LOC and the record of the \nself-reported history of suicidal ideation and behavior, Hayden found the patient to be \ncompletely WNL.  \nGiven the discrepancies in information and the severity of the inmate’s mental \nhealth history, Dr. Burns felt that the inmate should have been evaluated more often than \nthe standard ninety-day interval.56 Burns Trial Tr. vol. V at 1295:3-16, 1299:8-21 [Record \nDocument 539]. Instead, it took Deputy Warden Dauzat a week to complete her review of \nthe inmate’s initial screening, and all she wrote on the form was “[f]ollow up per policy,” \njust as the other inmate’s record indicated. See Ex. P-O-30 [Record Document 564-70]; \nsee also Ex. P-DD-1 [Record Document 564-108]. Witnesses on both sides testified that \nDeputy Warden Dauzat’s review of these intake forms regularly stated only “follow up \nper policy.” See Burns Trial Tr. vol. V at 1291:21-1292:8 [Record Document 539]; accord \nRobinson Trial Tr. vol. III at 697:22-24 [Record Document 536]; Hayden Trial Tr. vol. II \nat 376:25-377:17 [Record Document 534]. Specifically,  Hayden stated that all of the \nintake forms would have a note from Deputy Warden Dauzat stating “follow up per \n \n56 The ninety-day evaluation will be discussed at greater length below.  \n73 \n   \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 641   Filed 11/01/22   Page 74 of 165 PageID #: \n35300\npolicy” unless “there is an error.” Id. at 409:25-410:3. The Court also notes that every \nintake form it has independently reviewed stated only “follow up per policy” by Deputy \nWarden Dauzat. In light of the gross inadequacies and inaccuracies highlighted by Dr. \nBurns in these completed forms, the review by the licensed and qualified Deputy Warden \nDauzat appears meaningless.  \nIn addition to reviewing this inmate’s medical records, Dr. Burns testified that she \nhad interviewed this inmate. Burns Trial Tr. vol. V at 1295:22-25 [Record Document \n539]. Those interviews revealed that he continued to self-harm and that he had been \nplaced on both standard and extreme suicide watches, which was illustrative of the risk of \nharm posed by an inadequate initial assessment, the lack of timeliness or specificity in \nDeputy Warden Dauzat’s review, the failure to be seen by mental health more frequently, \nand the lack of an individual treatment plan. Id. at 1296:1-4, 1299:8-1300:3.  \nThe Court found Dr. Burns’s testimony to be compelling. Accordingly, the Court \nfinds that the evidence presented at trial demonstrated severe systemic deficiencies in the \nintake screening and evaluations conducted at DWCC. This is evident from 1) Hayden’s \nlack  of  education,  training,  and  certification,  2)  Deputy  Warden  Dauzat’s  failure  to \nconduct  routine,  thorough,  and  timely  audits  of  Hayden’s  intake  screenings,  3)  an \ninadequate amount of discussion or investigation into the discrepancies between EHCC \nrecords and information self-reported by inmates, 4) a seemingly inconsistent system of \nreferrals to the psychiatrist, Dr. Seal, and 5) the mental health department’s failure to \naddress an inmate’s individual needs at intake that may possibly be exacerbated without \nproper attention.  \n74 \n   \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 641   Filed 11/01/22   Page 75 of 165 PageID #: \n35301\nii.  Evaluation During Rounds \nThe Court also found systemic deficiencies in the evaluation process that occurs \nduring weekly rounds. In her testimony, Dr. Burns noted the importance of a correctional \nfacility, like DWCC, conducting weekly rounds. According to Dr. Burns, weekly rounds \nare an important way for the mental health department to monitor inmates with mental \nillness who are placed in restrictive housing. Burns Trial Tr. vol. V at 1304:6-14 [Record \nDocument 539]. Specifically, Dr. Burns testified that \nRounds are a means of surveillance. It is not treatment per se, but a mental \nhealth staff person would walk through a housing unit, restrictive housing \nunit once a week, announce their presence and stop briefly at every cell \ncontaining an inmate and inquire as to how they are doing, make verbal \ncontact, but also look at the condition of the cell, how the person is taking \ncare of themselves, ask if they are doing okay, if they need mental health of \nany sort, and make a note of that in their chart. But they would also, if a \nperson requested services, then schedule a later time to come back and have \na more extensive conversation privately in a confidential setting, with that \nperson about what the issue was.  \nId. at 1310:8-22. Rounds should be done as a proactive measure with the overarching \npurpose of serving as an additional mechanism for screening or surveillance. See id. at \n1310:24-1311:5, 1314:21-23. The failure to conduct rounds could result in the escalation \nof current health issues and a lack of clinical care. Id. at 1314:14-20. \nMental health staff at DWCC are required to complete weekly rounds. Dauzat Trial \nTr.  vol.  XV  at  3354:22-3355:4  [Record  Document  556].  However,  depending  on  an \ninmate’s level of care, some inmates should be seen on rounds more frequently than on a \nweekly basis. Specifically, DWCC’s internal policy requires that LOC-2 designees be \nvisited at least three times per week. Ex. J-7 at 6 [Record Document 565-13]. The purpose \n75 \n   \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 641   Filed 11/01/22   Page 76 of 165 PageID #: \n35302\nof rounds is to check-in with inmates. Dauzat Trial Tr. vol. XV at 3355:17-18 [Record \nDocument 556]. Mental health staff do not review the individual inmate records prior to \nthe completion of rounds. Hayden Trial Tr. vol. II at 323:3-15 [Record Document 534]. \nDuring the process of making rounds, mental health staff are supposed to conduct a cell-\nfront visit with every inmate in each tier. Dauzat Trial Tr. vol. XV at 3355:13-18 [Record \nDocument 556]. During that visit, an inmate can request additional time with mental \nhealth staff; similarly, mental health staff can decide to pursue additional intervention \nbased on the interaction. Id. at 3355:18-24. Mental health notes, known at DWCC as \nmental health progress notes, are only made if there is a “specific request or interaction \nthat warranted it.” Id. at 3356:7-13; see also Burgos Trial Tr. vol. XVI at 3786:24-3787:11 \n[Record Document 553]. Generally, the purpose of keeping a mental health progress note \nis to track an inmate’s care. Robinson Trial Tr. vol. III at 682:19-22 [Record Document \n536]. The mental health professional takes notes on a notepad during the interaction and \nwill fill out the form with that information upon return to his/her desk. Id. at 683:24-\n684:14. \nAccording to Dr. Burns, there is no indication that these rounds are conducted at \nDWCC at all. Burns Trial Tr. vol. V at 1312:9-12 [Record Document 539]. First, she \ntestified that the mental health records she reviewed did not demonstrate that rounds were \nregularly occurring, nor did she see any evidence that “indicated these people had been \nseen  on  rounds.”  Id.  at  1312:17-1313:10.  According  to  Dr.  Burns,  there  are  several \ndifferent ways that rounds can be adequately documented. Id. at 1311:6-8. Some facilities \nplace a card outside of each cell that is initialed and dated every time a mental health \n76 \n   \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 641   Filed 11/01/22   Page 77 of 165 PageID #: \n35303\nprofessional visits the cell-front; others have a guest book that documents each visitor to a \ntier and the duration of their stay. Id. at 1311:7-17. Other facilities have an officer that \ntracks the visits themselves; some correctional facilities keep a list with the name of every \ninmate in a housing unit and require subsequent documentation to correspond with that \nlist. Id. at 1311:18-1312:8.57 DWCC does not implement or require any of these practices. \nDr. Burns also testified that none of the inmates she interviewed reported the occurrence \nof regular rounds, only that “they would sometimes see people walk through, but mostly \nwhen it was predictable was when someone was on a watch, and then the mental health \nperson would come through to talk to the person on the [suicide] watch, but not . . . to stop \nat every cell and speak with everybody.” Id. at 1314:1-7.  \nThe  Court  notes  that  nothing  in  the  testimony  of  Defendants’  witnesses \ncontradicted Dr. Burns’s findings and conclusions. Hayden testified that he conducted \nweekly walk-throughs, but that only some inmates would speak with him. Hayden Trial \nTr. vol. II at 323:3-324:10 [Record Document 534]. Furthermore, he testified that he only \nmade note of a conversation with an inmate if it pertained to a mental health need. Id. at \n324:7-15. In fact, when Hayden was asked whether he documented if he completed rounds \non a tier, generally, he testified that “I don’t document that anywhere.” Id. at 324:7-10. \nRobinson and Steve Burgos described similar processes.  Dauzat  Trial Tr. vol. XV at \n3356:5-13 [Record Document 556]; see also Robinson Trial Tr. vol. III at 680:21-681:3 \n[Record Document 536]; Burgos Trial Tr. vol. XVI at 3607:8-17 [Record Document 560].  \n \n57 Some facilities may even utilize a combination of these strategies. Burns Trial Tr. vol. \nV at 1314:1-7 [Record Document 539]. \n77 \n   \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 641   Filed 11/01/22   Page 78 of 165 PageID #: \n35304\nThe Court finds that there is no evidence in the record that would demonstrate \nDWCC’s adherence to its own internal policies pertaining to rounds. Specifically, there is \nno indication that individuals with a LOC-2 designation were visited three times per week. \nThere is also no indication that inmates with a LOC-3 or LOC-4 designation were visited \nweekly during rounds.58 Additionally, Hayden admitted that he did not meet with every \ninmate during rounds. The existence of a policy—on which the mental health staff was \ntrained—which  mandates  these  rounds  demonstrates  knowledge  of  the  importance  of \nthese rounds to mental health care. The failure to conduct these rounds as per policy, \ncombined  with  the  inadequate  processes  for  documenting  the  rounds,  generally,  only \nfurther demonstrate the extent of systemic deficiencies at DWCC pertaining to screening \nand evaluation. \niii.  Mandatory Mental Health Evaluations \nThe  Court  also  finds  that  DWCC  does  not  conduct  mandatory  mental  health \nevaluations for LOC-2, LOC-3, and LOC-4 inmates. As previously noted, though DWCC \nis not a LOC-2 facility, it will occasionally accept inmates that have been given a LOC-2 \ndesignation at EHCC. Dr. Thompson also noted that some inmates at DWCC “might look \na  little  bit  more  than  three.”  Thompson  Trial  Tr.  vol.  XVII  at  4002:21-24  [Record \nDocument  561].  Employee  Policy  Memorandum  #03-02-003  outlines  the  evaluation \nrequirements for each level of care. Ex. J-7 at 6 [Record Document 565-13]. According to \n \n58  Employee Policy Memorandum #03-02-003 does not require that inmates with a LOC-3 \nor LOC-4 designation are visited during rounds as it does for inmates with a LOC-2 \ndesignation. See Ex. J-7 [Record Document 565-13] However, Deputy Warden Dauzat \ntestified that mental health staff at DWCC are required to complete weekly rounds on \nevery tier. Dauzat Trial Tr. vol. XV at 3354:22-3355:4 [Record Document 556]. \n78 \n   \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 641   Filed 11/01/22   Page 79 of 165 PageID #: \n35305\nDWCC  policy,  inmates  assigned  a  LOC-4  designation  should  have  “individualized \ncontact” with mental health staff every 180 days; LOC-3 and LOC-2 should meet with \nmental health staff every ninety and thirty days, respectively. Id.  \nThe  Court  found  no  indication  that  these  “individualized  contacts”  take  place. \nThere  was  no  testimony,  expert  or  otherwise,  that  indicated  that  these  mental  health \nevaluations occur, nor is there any evidence in the record that would reveal otherwise.59 \nThere  are  segregated  interviews  that  occur  every  thirty  and  ninety  days.  But  these \ninterviews  are  for  all  inmates  in  segregated  housing,  and,  as  discussed  below,  are \ninadequate evaluations of mental health status in both design and execution. Additionally, \nnot all LOC-2, LOC-3, and LOC-4 inmates are in the segregated housing. Some of these \ninmates are housed in general population.60 Additionally, there is no list or roster of \ninmates on the mental health caseload. Without such a list, it would be nearly impossible \nto keep track of where each inmate on the mental health caseload resides, when the last \npoint of contact was, and when the next appointment should be scheduled. This is a clear \nviolation of internal DWCC policy and further indication of the systemic deficiencies in \nthe mental health program.  \n \n59 Dr. Burns testified regarding a thirty-day evaluation policy, but that policy is outside of \nthe March 2020 discovery deadline for the Liability Phase of this trial. See Burns Trial Tr. \nvol. V at 1306:20-22 [Record Document 539].  \n60 The Court recognizes that general population is not within the scope of this case. \nHowever, it is relevant to note that LOC-3 or LOC-4 inmates may be assigned to general \npopulation with no record that they require additional follow-up to check their mental \nhealth status, per DOC and DWCC policy. Again, there is no list that outlines the mental \nhealth caseload.  \n79 \n   \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 641   Filed 11/01/22   Page 80 of 165 PageID #: \n35306\niv.  Mandatory Segregated Housing Evaluations \nFinally, the Court finds there to be systemic deficiencies in the periodic evaluations \nof individuals housed on extended lockdown conducted at DWCC. DWCC policy states \nthat “[a] qualified mental health staff person . . . shall interview and prepare a written \nreport of the findings on any inmate remaining in [extended lockdown] for more than 30 \ndays.  If  segregation  or  detention  continues  for  more  than  30  [sic]  days,  further \nassessments shall be made every three months (90 [sic] days).” Ex. J-7 at 8-9 [Record \nDocument 565-13]. When a person is first admitted to segregated housing, they receive an \nevaluation within thirty days; if an individual stays in “segregation” longer than that, he is \nreevaluated  every  ninety  days.  Hayden  Trial  Tr.  vol.  II  at  487:23-488:6  [Record \nDocument  534].  These  evaluations  are  meant  to  differ  from  rounds  in  that  these \ninteractions  are  a  more  detailed,  structured,  documented  means  of  assessing  how  an \ninmate  is  doing.  Burns  Trial  Tr.  vol.  V  at  1315:14-23  [Record  Document  539]. \nSpecifically, the purpose of these segregated interviews “is to identify people who are in \nneed of mental health treatment and so that they get it, so that they are scheduled for \nmental health treatment or potentially transferred to a higher level of care, if that is what \nthey need.” Id. at 1329:3-8. A failure to properly conduct these assessments can result in \nharm to the individual and those around him, further disciplinary issues, or a decline in \nmental health. Id. at 1329:16-1330:1. \nHayden and Robinson generally conduct the thirty- and ninety-day assessments on \nthe  South  Compound,  and  each  testified  as  to  the  process  of  completing  an  inmate \nevaluation. Generally, an inmate’s individual records and prior segregation interviews are \n80 \n   \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 641   Filed 11/01/22   Page 81 of 165 PageID #: \n35307\nnot reviewed in preparation for the next interview. Robinson Trial Tr. vol. III at 691:7-10 \n[Record Document 536]; see also Hayden Trial Tr. vol. II at 489:10-490:23 [Record \nDocument 534]. The assessments are generally conducted cell-front. Robinson Trial Tr. \nvol. III at 692:3-5 [Record Document 536]. The mental health staff member conducting \nthe evaluation will carry around a notepad to document the assessment and will then \ncomplete a DWCC Mental Health Department Interview of Segregated Inmate form back \nin the office. Hayden Trial Tr. vol. II at 490:24-491:6 [Record Document 534]; see, e.g., \nEx.  P-OOO-20  [Record  Document  564-227].  Robinson  completes  all  her  ninety-day \nreviews every March, June, September, and December. Robinson Trial Tr.  vol. III at \n689:13-16 [Record Document 536]. Hayden testified that he completes his assessments \nninety days from each inmate’s initial thirty-day order. Hayden Trial Tr. vol. II. at 487:8-\n488:1 [Record Document 534].61  \nAgain, the Court found Dr. Burns’s analysis of the periodic  evaluations  to be \ninformative and persuasive. Dr. Burns testified that these periodic interviews of inmates \non segregation at DWCC are inadequate for several reasons. First, Dr. Burns raised the \nissue that Hayden is not qualified to conduct these interviews. As previously discussed, \nHayden lacks the education, training, and certification required to properly diagnose and \nunderstand mental health issues. Additionally, there is a lack of meaningful oversight and \n \n61 When asked by the Court whether he conducts his interviews ninety days from an \ninmate’s initial evaluation or on the March, June, September, December schedule \nRobinson outlined, Hayden responded, “I don’t have a March whatever schedule.” \nHayden Trial Tr. vol. II at 487:14-18 [Record Document 534]. \n81 \n   \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 641   Filed 11/01/22   Page 82 of 165 PageID #: \n35308\naudit by somebody who is qualified to conduct these interviews, like Deputy Warden \nDauzat.  \nSecond, Dr. Burns testified about the nature of the periodic interviews conducted. \nSpecifically, Dr. Burns articulated her reasons for believing that the cell-front interviews \nshould instead be conducted in a confidential area, away from the other inmates and \nsecurity staff. Burns Trial Tr. vol. V at 1315:24-25 [Record Document 539]. This is \nbecause, without confidentiality, there is a  risk that an inmate suffering from serious \nmental health issues will choose not to confide in the mental health professional about the \nstate of his mental health for fear that another inmate would learn deeply personal and \nsensitive information and use it in retaliation. See id. at 1315:24-1316:6. A failure to \ndisclose information could mean that the inmate may not receive the level of care or \nattention that his current mental state requires.  \nDr. Burns testified that requiring these interviews be conducted cell-front is not the \nonly means of ensuring the mental health staff’s security. Id. at 1316:13-1317:6. Instead of \nthe cell-front interviews, Dr. Burns stated that inmates could be taken to a secure location \nwhere the security staff may have visualization of what is happening, such as access to \nview  the  conversation  through  a  window,  but  where  the  inmate  would  be  assured \nconfidentiality in his conversation with staff. Id. at 1316:17-19. Alternatively, DWCC \ncould  procure  high-security  furniture  and  talking  booths  to  be  utilized  during  these \ninteractions. Id. at 1316:19-1317:6. Dr. Burns testified that these would be reasonable \naccommodations for security and safety and could assist in ensuring that mental health \n82 \n   \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 641   Filed 11/01/22   Page 83 of 165 PageID #: \n35309\nstaff are safe during the evaluations, while still offering inmates a confidential and private \nway to discuss their mental health. See id. 1315:24-1317:6.  \nThe Court found Dr. Burns’s analysis to be very compelling here. Specifically, Dr. \nBurns’s testimony outlining the risks posed by non-confidential cell-front interviews—\nincluding the risks to an inmate’s safety and the potential barriers they create to mental \nhealth treatment—was convincing. Dr. Burns also testified that many of the inmates with \nwhom she spoke did not know about the ninety day assessment because of the cell-front, \nnon-confidential nature of the evaluation. Burns Trial Tr. vol. V at 1317:10-20 [Record \nDocument 539]. This is plausible because there does not seem to be much differentiation \nin the duration, location, and nature of questions asked between the mental health rounds \nand the more extensive thirty- and ninety-day assessments.  \nThird,  Dr.  Burns  testified  about  the  inadequacy  of  the  assessments  and  their \ndocumentation. Dr. Burns argued that there was no documented evidence of a mental \nhealth  evaluation  or  true  mental  status  examination  conducted  during  the  thirty-  and \nninety-day segregated housing interviews; instead, the documentation consisted of a one-\npage  checklist  with  “all  of  the  elements  of  the  mental  health  status  exam.”  See  id. \n1318:12-18.  Dr.  Burns  noted  that  many  of  the  records  she  examined  had  the \n“within normal limits” box checked in every category, with no additional details that \nwould indicate differentiations in mental status between the inmates. Id. at 1318:15-24. \nDr. Burns also concluded that the checklists made it apparent that the people doing the \nassessments were doing sixteen to twenty per day. Id. at 1319:1-2. Dr. Burns discussed the \nimpossibility  of  thoroughly,  accurately,  and  confidentially  conducting  that  many \n83 \n   \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 641   Filed 11/01/22   Page 84 of 165 PageID #: \n35310\nevaluations  per  day.  Id.  at  1319:2-7.  In  fact,  to  be  a  useful  record  and  productive \nconversation, Dr. Burns testified that she would expect each evaluation to take between \nten to fifteen minutes, not including the time it took to find an officer available to escort \nthe inmate to a confidential setting. Id. at 1320:1-6.  \nDr.  Burns’s  analysis  of  two  evaluations  of  inmate  “H,”  who  was  housed  on \nsegregated housing at the time, further highlights the deficiencies in reporting.62 These \nevaluations were conducted on the same day, but one was by Hayden and the other by Dr. \nSeal. See Burns Trial Tr. vol. V at 1321:13-1325:24 [Record Document 539]. In reviewing \nHayden’s report, Dr. Burns testified that the document “doesn’t tell me anything about his \ntreatment. It is just that he is going to be followed per policy. It doesn’t say what his \ncondition  is.  It  doesn't  say  what  his  diagnosis  is.  And  so,  it  really  doesn't  tell  me \nanything.”  Id.  at  1322:11-15.  Additionally,  the  assessment  notes  the  inmate  “refused \nfurther conversation.” Id. at 1323:7-8.  Dr. Burns stated that the refusal of conversation \nfails to explain the responses listed in the rest of the report because many of the items on \nthe assessment are only answerable through meaningful conversation to evaluate things \nlike mood and orientation. Id. at 1322:20-1323:23. Dr. Burns stated that Hayden’s report \nis inconsistent with Dr. Seal’s report. Id. at 1325:16-18. According to Dr. Burns, Dr. \nSeal’s evaluation notes indicate that the inmate was speaking with dead relatives and that \nthere were some auditory and visual hallucinations.  Id. at 1325:19-22. It was clear to Dr. \nBurns that the inmate was not WNL as Hayden had noted. Id. at 1325:22-24.  \n \n62 The Court cannot independently review these two documents, Exs. P-LL-87 and P-LL-\n188, because they were not offered into evidence.   \n84 \n   \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 641   Filed 11/01/22   Page 85 of 165 PageID #: \n35311\nDr. Burns also examined Exs. P-OOO-47-66 [Record Document 564-228].63 This \ngroup of exhibits is comprised  of twenty periodic assessments of segregated inmates \nperformed by Robinson on June 13, 2018. Id. Dr. Burns commented,  \n[I]t was surprising to see how many could be done in a single day. That was \nan indication that they were just done at the South Compound as opposed to \nin a confidential setting [and] lots of the assessment [were] the same. They \nwere within normal limits check off over and over and that the person \neither  would  not  speak  or  [refused]  to  answer  questions  or  had  no \ncomplaints, and they were just going to . . . follow up per policy.  \nBurns Trial Tr. vol. V at 1326:23-1327:7 [Record Document 539]. The Court conducted \nits own examination of these twenty documents and confirmed that they are all identical \nexcept for the inmate’s name and inmate number. Indeed, when held up to the light, all the \nlines purportedly filled in individually by Robinson overlap precisely. That is, they appear \nto be exact copies. The most telling sign was the “[c]ontinue to follow-up per policy” note \nthat is multiple spaces away from the beginning of the line. Exs. P-OOO-47-66 [Record \nDocument 564-228]. The Court can only conclude that each of these documents was \ncreated and replicated through the “save as” feature on a computer. Hayden does the same; \nthe Court reviewed twenty-four segregation interviews that are all “WNL” and have the \nsame assessment listed. See, e.g., Exs. P-OOO-20-43 [Record Document 564-227]; see \nalso Hayden Trial Tr. vol. II at 496:2-512:15 [Record Document 534]. Additionally, all \ntwenty-four of Hayden’s segregation interviews contain the same date. Id.  \n \n63 The trial transcript states that these are Exs. P-OOO-47-67. However, the records lists \nthe range as Exs. P-OOO-47-66 [Record Document 564-228]. The Court interprets this as \nan error.  \n85 \n   \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 641   Filed 11/01/22   Page 86 of 165 PageID #: \n35312\n  The Court evaluated the three different types of inmate evaluations completed at \nDWCC—the  initial  intake  screening  and  evaluation,  weekly  rounds,  and  the  periodic \nsegregated  housing  thirty- and ninety-day evaluations—and found there to be several \nsystemic deficiencies present in them all. Additionally, no evidence was presented at trial \nthat a mandatory fourth type of evaluation, the periodic mental health evaluation, occurs at \nall. Accordingly, this Court finds that these deficiencies rise to the level of an Eighth \nAmendment violation.   \n(b)  Mental Health Treatment  \nThe Court finds that the evidence at trial also demonstrated systemic deficiencies in \nDWCC’s mental health treatment. As previously mentioned, an inmate’s mental health \ntreatment  is  imperative  to  inmate  stability  and  health,  as  well  as  preventing  overall \nbehavioral issues and maintaining safety for the inmate, other inmates, and prison staff. \nHowever, there are several aspects of mental health treatment at DWCC that rise to the \nlevel of a constitutional violation, including the failure to individualize treatment plans, \nthe reliance on the prescription of psychotropic medication as the sole treatment, and the \nprovision of inappropriate and inadequate therapeutic materials. The Court will address \neach topic individually below.  \ni.  The Failure to Individualize Treatment \nFirst,  the  Court  found  there  to  be  systemic  deficiencies  in  DWCC’s  inmate \ntreatment plans. According to Dr. Burns: \nA treatment plan is . . . the roadmap of what the person’s condition is, what \ntheir strengths are, what their weaknesses are, and what their symptoms are, \nand how frequently they occur, who is going to provide treatment, what \n86 \n   \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 641   Filed 11/01/22   Page 87 of 165 PageID #: \n35313\nkind of treatment is going to be provided and at what frequency for the \nperson, and then measure at subsequent team meetings  their attainment \ntowards  written  goals  on  the  plan.  So,  it  contains  interventions,  the \nobjectives, the goals, and then you measure how they are doing and adjust \nthings accordingly if they are not moving toward goal attainment.   \nBurns Trial Tr. vol. V at 1330:8-21 [Record Document 539]. The creation of a meaningful \ntreatment plan, with input from all parties who interact with the inmate, is part of the \nminimum  standard  of  care.  Id.  at  1330:25-1331:4.  Individual  treatment  plans  are \nspecifically  tailored  to  address  the  inmate’s  needs  and  medical  history.  The \nimplementation  of  an  individualized  treatment  plan  has  become  a  standard  industry \npractice across the corrections and mental health fields because it helps keep all parties \ninvolved—inmates and staff—aware of all expected services and anticipated outcomes. \nSee  id.  at  1331:5-17.  Experts  for  both  Plaintiffs  and  Defendants  agreed  that  an \nindividualized treatment plan, as opposed to a standard plan that all individuals follow, \nwould  be  their  professional  recommendation.  See  Thompson  Trial  Tr.  vol.  XVII  at \n4125:22-4126:10  [Record  Document  561];  accord  Burns  Trial  Tr.  vol.  V  at  1330:8-\n1331:22 [Record Document 539]. Dr. Thompson commented, “[it] is not an uncommon \nproblem at any system we evaluate, that treatment plans end up being cookie cutter. These \nwere particularly cookie cutter . . . it would be nice if they had . . . better goals and \nobjectives.” Thompson Trial Tr. vol. XVII at 4126:3-10 [Record Document 561].  \nIn fact, DWCC’s own policy requires individualized treatment plans. The post \norder  titled,  Employee  Policy  Memorandum  #03-02-003,  contains  a  section  called \n87 \n   \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 641   Filed 11/01/22   Page 88 of 165 PageID #: \n35314\n“Treatment Planning” that outlines the requirements for inmate treatment plans at DWCC. \nEx. J-7 at 9 [Record Document 565-13].64 The order states: \nAll offenders who are designated as requiring a mental health LOC of 1, 2, \n3, 4 shall be provided an individualized, written mental health treatment \nplan . . . The treatment plan should include the long-term goals, short term \nobjectives, housing assignments, methods of treatment, identification of the  \nmental health and other personnel involved in the care and supervision of \nthe offender, and directions to the mental health staff and other personnel \nregarding their roles in the care [and] supervision of the offender.  \nId. (emphasis added). Deputy Warden Dauzat agreed that DWCC policy requires the \nimplementation of an individualized treatment plan, and in fact, as Deputy Warden, she is \ntasked with assuring compliance. Dauzat Trial Tr. vol. III at 768:6-13 [Record Document \n536].  \nHowever, witnesses for both Plaintiffs and Defendants have agreed that DWCC has \nonly adopted a standard treatment plan. Hayden testified that the “short-term objectives” \nand “long-term goals” were the same on all treatment plans. Hayden Trial Tr. vol. III at \n585:16-21 [Record Document 536]. Deputy Warden Dauzat testified that on the South \nCompound “[t]he treatment plans goals were identical . . . Given the population over \nthere, the goals were pretty much the same.” Dauzat Trial Tr. vol. III at 769:7-13 [Record \nDocument 536]. She further testified that the treatment plans she approved contained \nidentical short-term and long-term goals. Id. at 768:18-769:1. During her review of inmate \nmental  health  records,  Dr.  Burns  also  observed  that  the  treatment  plans  were  not \nindividualized, stating that “[the treatment plan] is the exact same form each and every \n \n64 In Hayden Trial Tr. vol. II at 329:14 [Record Document 534], this is referred to as “J-\n22.” However, it was filed into the record as J-7 [Record Document 565-13].  \n88 \n   \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 641   Filed 11/01/22   Page 89 of 165 PageID #: \n35315\ntime.” Burns Trial Tr. vol. V at 1334:8-21 [Record Document 539]. Further, the standard \nplans are not tailored to address changes in mental health status as they arise. Burns Trial \nTr. vol. V at 1334:8-21 [Record Document 539]. Considering the information presented \nregarding  the  necessity  of  an  individualized  treatment  plan  and  given  that  individual \ntreatment plans are required by DWCC policy, the Court finds that the failure to tailor \neach plan to the individual inmate is just another example of the widespread systemic \ndeficiencies at DWCC.  \nii.  Prescription Medication as Sole Treatment \nThe Court also finds that DWCC’s reliance on the prescription of psychotropic \nmedication as the only type of mental health treatment in place at the facility further \nevidences  systemic  deficiencies.  DWCC’s  post  order  regarding  the  Mental  Health \nProgram states that “mental health services provided at DWCC on an outpatient basis \nshall include detection, diagnosis, and treatment of mental illness. These services shall be \nprovided  by  qualified  mental  health  professionals  and  may  include  comprehensive \nevaluation,  individual  counseling,  psychiatric  consultation,  group  therapy,  or  any \ncombination of the aforementioned.” Ex. J-7 at 1 [Record Document 565-13] (emphasis \nadded). Additionally, special programs must be made available for inmates with a history \nof substance abuse or sexual offenses. Id. at 2. The post order identifies three routes \navailable for an inmate to take advantage of any mental health program: self-referral, \nreferral by staff, or referral by another inmate. Id. at 8. All referrals must be answered \nwithin fourteen days. Id. These services are required offerings.  \n89 \n   \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 641   Filed 11/01/22   Page 90 of 165 PageID #: \n35316\nThough DWCC guarantees the availability of these mental health programs, the \nonly mental health treatment provided to inmates on the South Compound is psychotropic \nmedication prescription and management. See Dauzat Trial Tr. vol. III at 772:19-773:10 \n[Record  Document  536].  Previously,  DWCC  had  implemented  a  pilot  transitional \ntreatment  program  (“TTP”)  with  ten  inmates  that  targeted  the  underlying  causes \nperpetuating  behavior  issues,  but  that  program  has  since  been  discontinued.  Deputy \nWarden Dauzat stated that TTP was discontinued for “lack of participation.” Id. at 726:13-\n731:7.  While  Robinson  also  testified  that  the  program  was  terminated  for  lack  of \nparticipation, she had previously indicated in a deposition that lack of manpower and time \nwere causes for the discontinuation of the program. Robinson Trial Tr. vol. III at 679:5-\n680:10  [Record  Document  536].  There  is  also  no  in-cell  or  out-of-cell  programming \navailable  to inmates in restricted  housing.  See  Dauzat  Trial Tr.  vol. III  at 772:11-15 \n[Record Document 536]. Other correctional systems provide individuals counseling as \npart of their mental health program. Id. at 1339:3-6. The fact that DWCC fails to do so is a \ndeviation from the minimum standard of mental health care. Unfortunately, the use of \nmedication is the only treatment upon which individuals on the South Compound can rely.  \nAccording to Dr. Burns, DWCC’s failure to provide counseling or programming, \nwhich are considered proactive forms of treatment, leaves an inmate at greater risk of self-\nharm. See generally Burns Trial Tr. vol. V at 1343:9-13 [Record Document 539]. This is \nbecause behavioral issues and suicidal ideations that could be mitigated or addressed \nthrough therapy are instead allowed to worsen. Id. at 1343:13-1344:23. Deputy Warden \nDauzat testified that any inmate on the segregated housing unit that requested individual \n90 \n   \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 641   Filed 11/01/22   Page 91 of 165 PageID #: \n35317\ncounseling would receive it. Dauzat Trial Tr. vol. III at 791:18-24 [Record Document \n536]. However, Dr. Burns testified that in the hundreds of restricted housing interviews \nshe reviewed,  she saw no evidence  that counseling sessions had taken place,  despite \nhaving seen places in the record where inmates had requested counseling. See generally \nBurns Trial Tr. vol. V at 1337:25-1340:20 [Record Document 539]. \nDr. Burns testified that either individual or group therapy—ideally both—should be \noffered  to  an  inmate  and  conducted  in  a  private  space  by  a  licensed  and  trained \nprofessional.  Id. at 1337:2-9. An inmate should be assigned homework to ensure he is \ngrasping and engaging with the information learned between sessions. Id. at 1338:8-11. \nThe  treatment  plan  and  medical  records  should  document  the  session’s  logistics,  the \nsubject  covered  in  the  session,  a  discussion  of  counseling’s  logistics,  any  relevant \nhomework, and a progress note documenting the inmate’s overall mental health status. Id. \nat 1337:20-1388:7. None of this occurs at DWCC, despite an obvious need for counseling \nand despite inmates’ affirmative requests for counseling.  \nAccordingly, the Court finds there to be systemic deficiencies in the treatment \noptions available to inmates at DWCC. \niii.  Appointments with Dr. Seal \nThe way in which Dr. Seal conducts his appointments also prevents inmates from \nreceiving adequate treatment and care while at DWCC. On the South Compound, Dr. Seal \nwould meet with inmates in one of the disciplinary courtrooms. Seal Trial Tr. vol. V at \n1116:8-10 [Record Document 539]. The Court reviewed the photo of this courtroom that \nwas admitted into evidence. The courtroom is small, with a raised platform in the corner \n91 \n   \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 641   Filed 11/01/22   Page 92 of 165 PageID #: \n35318\nof the room. Ex. P-GGG-207 [Record Document 564-200]. A basic wooden desk sits on \ntop of the platform. Id. In the photo, Dr. Haney sits at the desk. Despite being seated, the \nraised  platform  makes  it  appear  as  though  that  he  is  angled  slightly  above  the \nphotographer. Id. That is where Dr. Seal would sit for his evaluations. Seal Trial Tr. vol. V \nat 1117:10-12 [Record Document 539]. A member of mental health staff stays in the room \nwith Dr. Seal, and almost always, so does security staff, unless the inmate specifically \nrequests  that  they  leave.  Id.  at  1117:15-1118:23.65  The  inmate  would  typically  be  in \nrestraints. Id. at 1118:1-3According to Dr. Seal, Hayden would provide him a file, which \nDr. Seal would review for a minute or two before an inmate is brought into the courtroom. \nId. at 1120:5-22. During the review period, Dr. Seal would look at his prior notes about \ndiagnosis, medication, symptoms, and prior behaviors. Id. at 1120:23-1122:1. He would \nnot review any disciplinary documentation, relying instead on verbal reports from mental \nhealth staff regarding any behavioral issues. Id. at 1122:3-12. \n  This entire interaction seems to create an environment that is the antithesis of what \nproper therapy and treatment require. First, it is inappropriate for these appointments to be \nheld in the courtroom. The very purpose of the room is for disciplinary hearings, which is \nclear from the layout of the room itself. Dr. Seal sits on a pedestal towering over the \ninmates.  Second, there is a lack of  confidentiality.  The brief appointment is not just \nbetween doctor and patient; the room also has a member of security staff and a member of \nthe mental health staff. As previously mentioned, the fact that an inmate can ask for the \n \n65 Though this is allegedly an option for inmates, there was no testimony to explain what \nsecurity measures would be in place should an inmate request that the officer leave the \nroom.  \n92 \n   \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 641   Filed 11/01/22   Page 93 of 165 PageID #: \n35319\nsecurity guard to leave does not minimize the confidentiality issues; instead, it serves to \nfurther highlight the deficiencies in the system because there is no way for inmates to \nknow they may request to do so. The environment is intimidating and does not promote \nthe vulnerability and trust required in these sensitive appointments to ensure effective \ntreatment.   \niv.  Inadequate Therapeutic Materials \nFinally,  the  Court  finds  that  while  internal  policy  recognizes  that  psychiatric \ntreatment  must  include  therapy,  current  treatment  solely  relies  on  medication \nmanagement.  This  is  further  demonstrated  by  DWCC’s  failure  to  provide  inmates \nmeaningful  and  helpful  therapeutic  materials.  DWCC  purports  to  provide  self-help \nmaterials  to  inmates  struggling  with  their  mental  illness.  Dauzat  Trial  Tr.  vol.  III  at \n774:23-775:2 [Record Document 536]. Deputy Warden Dauzat testified that DWCC’s \ntherapeutic materials address “stress management, anger management, substance abuse, \nAA/NA,  something  relative  to  grief  counseling.”  Id.  at  775:2-6.  However,  Plaintiffs’ \ncounsel contends that only a single document was produced during discovery that can \nsupport  Deputy  Warden  Dauzat’s  testimony.  They  are  correct;  Ex.  D-39  [Record \nDocument 564-281], which is a counselor’s model for a course called “Understanding and \nReducing Angry Feelings,” was the sole document  produced by Defendants. In other \nwords, no other materials were adduced at trial that can support Deputy Warden Dauzat’s \nclaim. This manual was created by the Texas Institute of Behavioral Research at Texas \nChristian  University  and  was  “derived  from  cognitive  behavioral  models  designed \nparticularly for counselors.” Id. It introduces a topic, offers a relevant activity, provides \n93 \n   \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 641   Filed 11/01/22   Page 94 of 165 PageID #: \n35320\nsome information on how to analyze the activity, and gives a “tying up” synopsis at the \nend of the subject.  \nThese materials are clearly inadequate and inappropriate for inmate use. First, the \nmanual is designed for an individual with education and experience teaching in this area. \nThe manual specifically states that it is to be used by “counselors and group facilitators.” \nId. at 2.  This means that these materials will be inappropriate and of little worth to most \ninmates unless an inmate has an educational background or extensive experience working \nin a mental health setting. As Dr. Burns highlighted in her testimony, inmates—especially \nthose with intellectual disabilities—would have difficulty reading and processing these \nmaterials.  Burns  Trial  Tr.  vol.  V  at  1287:8-12  [Record  Document  539].  Therefore, \nalthough Deputy Warden Dauzat stated that DWCC provides therapeutic materials, the \nevidence adduced at trial clearly indicated that no meaningful mental health materials are \nmade available to inmates.  \nThe inappropriate training manuals, the failure to create individualized treatment \nplans, the intimidating and non-confidential appointments with Dr. Seal, and the inability \nto provide adequate treatment through therapy or programming all rise to the level of an \nEighth Amendment violation.  \n(c)  Staffing of the Mental Health Department \nThe Court also finds that DWCC’s mental health department is understaffed, which \ncontributes to DWCC’s failure to provide adequate mental health care to inmates. As \npreviously mentioned, Dr. Seal is the only psychiatrist providing care at DWCC, and his \ncontract is to provide eighteen hours of service per month. Record Document 24 ¶¶ 64-66. \n94 \n   \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 641   Filed 11/01/22   Page 95 of 165 PageID #: \n35321\nThis time includes his travel time from Shreveport to Homer, Louisiana. Id. Dr. Seal visits \nthe prison every two weeks, Seal Trial Tr. vol. XVII at 3857:4-7 [Record Document 561], \nand he is onsite for about five hours each visit after deducting travel time. Seal Trial Tr. \nvol. V at 1110:9-1111:16 [Record Document 539]. Dr. Seal estimated that twenty-five \npercent  of  the  DWCC  population  suffered  from  some  type  of  mental  illness.  Id.  at \n1109:15-20. These individuals would be considered his patients. During a visit, Dr. Seal \nsees about thirty-two patients on both the North and South Compound. Id. at 1115:8-13. \nMedication checks can take about three to five minutes, while an interview with a new \npatient takes an average of ten minutes. Id. at 1123:23-1124:8. \nFirst, the amount of time that Dr. Seal is contracted to spend at DWCC is wholly \ninadequate.66 According to Dr. Burns’s testimony, the American Psychiatric Association’s \nguidelines recommend that there be one full-time psychiatrist (or equivalent) employed to \nserve  every  150-200 inmates,  which is less than the estimated number of inmates at \nDWCC with mental illness. Burns Trial Tr. vol. VI at 1418:9-21 [Record Document 540]. \nDr. Burns stated that because inmates on the South Compound require greater care and \nsecurity measures, she would recommend one full-time psychiatrist for every 150 people. \nId. at 1418:12-1420:2. Dr. Thompson concurred, testifying that “a little more Dr. Seal \nwould [go] a long way,” and suggested increasing Dr. Seal’s contractual hours to half or \n \n66 This is not a criticism of Dr. Seal as a psychiatrist, but a criticism of the terms of his \ncontract. He admitted that he was only contracted for eighteen hours per month for the \npurpose of prescribing medication. At the same time, as a psychiatrist, he should know \nthat inmates would have benefitted from counseling and of the inadequacy of the \ntreatment provided to them. Yet, there is no indication in the record of him expressing \nthese concerns to DWCC.  \n95 \n   \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 641   Filed 11/01/22   Page 96 of 165 PageID #: \n35322\nthree-quarters time. Thompson Trial Tr. vol. XVII at 4078:17-4079:12 [Record Document \n561].  \nIt is also worth noting that Dr. Seal is unaware of the conditions of strip cell status, \nstandard suicide watch, or extreme suicide watch. Dr. Seal testified that he is not able to \nmake decisions about the conditions of suicide watch. Seal Trial Tr. vol. V at 1226:5-7 \n[Record Document 539]. More concerning, however, is Dr. Seal’s testimony that he does \nnot even know the conditions of standard or extreme suicide watch. Id. at 1226:17-21. He \nalso stated that he does not know what circumstances would lead to somebody being \nplaced  in  a  paper  gown  versus  a  jumpsuit.  Id.  at  1227:24-1228:2.  Not  knowing  the \nconditions of strip cell status, standard suicide watch, and extreme suicide watch prevent \nDr. Seal from asking targeted questions to better understand an inmate’s current mental \nstate,  mental  status,  and  mood,  generally.  This  further  highlights  the  inadequacies  of \ntreatment available to inmates at DWCC.  \nAdditionally, Dr. Seal does not spend sufficient time with each inmate. Dr. Burns, \nwho  has  extensive  experience  working  as  a  prison  psychiatrist,  stated  that  inmates \nrequiring  a  simple  medication  check  and  not  exhibiting  any  worrisome  behaviors  or \nindications  of  a  change  in  their  mental  health  status  mental  illness  only  require  a \npsychiatric visit of about ten to fifteen minutes. Burns Trial Tr. vol. VI 1411:23-1412:3 \n[Record Document 540]. However, initial appointments at intake, even those intra-system \ntransfers from EHCC, should take closer to forty-five minutes to one hour because the \npsychiatrist  should  thoroughly  review  the  inmate’s  prison  and  medical  records  and \ncomplete  a  comprehensive  mental  health  evaluation.  Id.  at  1412:3-12.  Her  testimony \n96 \n   \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 641   Filed 11/01/22   Page 97 of 165 PageID #: \n35323\nmakes it clear that the three to ten minutes Dr. Seal spends with his patients are barely \neven adequate for a standard medication check-in. Additionally, Dr. Seal is not able to see \nall inmates on a regular basis, and it can take a few weeks to a few months to be able to \nschedule  an  appointment  with  him.  Id.  at  1424:11-24.  Dr.  Burns  described  the  risks \nassociated with a patient having to wait so long for an appointment with Dr. Seal: \nPeople are going to have symptoms. They are going to decompensate . . . \nthey are going to have behavioral problems. They are going to receive \ndisciplinary reports. They are going to stay in restrictive housing longer as \na  consequence  of  receiving  those  reports.  They  are  at  risk  of  harming \nthemselves or harming other people, and then become at risk of having . . . \nforce used against them and hurting someone else. \nId. at 1424:25-1425:9. Accordingly, the Court concludes that the psychiatric staffing is \nplainly inadequate, which results in delays in treatment and the inability to provide other \ntreatment besides medication management.   \nThe  Court  also  finds  that  there  are  adequacy  issues  with  the  mental  health \ndepartment in general. Dr. Burns was unable to determine exactly how many inmates were \non the mental health caseload due to poor tracking and record keeping. Id. at 1423:21-23. \nBased on the estimated numbers, Dr. Burns testified that she would recommend staffing \none mental health professional for a caseload of sixty inmates. Id. at 1422:1-6. This would \nallow the mental health staff to perform individual and group interventions, conduct the \nthirty- and ninety-day evaluations on every segregated inmate, complete rounds, and be \navailable  for  suicide  watches.  Similarly,  Dr.  Thompson  recommended  two  full-time \nmental health professionals for the DWCC caseload. Thompson Trial Tr. vol. XVII at \n97 \n   \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 641   Filed 11/01/22   Page 98 of 165 PageID #: \n35324\n4071:13-16 [Record Document 561]. DWCC’s mental health department falls far short of \nthese recommendations.  \nAs  previously  stated,  Hayden,  who  is  not  licensed,  and  Burgos,  a  Licensed \nProfessional Counselor, are the primary workers responsible for delivering services to \ninmates on the South Compound. The same issues previously discussed with regards to \nHayden’s training, education, and credentials continue to be of issue here, as he lacks the \nability to diagnose or counsel inmates diagnosed with mental illness. Burns Trial Tr. vol. \nVI  at  1425:23-1426:8  [Record  Document  540].  Regardless,  the  evidence  shows  that \nHayden and Burgos are unable to provide full-time services to the inmates on the South \nCompound because they are also tasked with substantial responsibilities on the North \nCompound. Id. at 1425:14-22. Simply put, it is not possible for Hayden and Burgos to \nprovide adequate services splitting time between the North and South Compounds.  \nThe evidence presented at trial by both Plaintiffs and Defendants demonstrates that \nDWCC’s mental health staffing is severely inadequate given the facility’s population size. \nThis is both with respect to psychiatric services as well as the mental health department \nmore  broadly.  The  Court’s  findings  here  serve  to  further  demonstrate  the  systemic \ndeficiencies visible at DWCC.  \n(d)  Safeguards for Psychotropic Medication  \nAs  noted  in  the  “Mental  Health  Treatment”  subsection,  the  prescription  of \nmedication is the only type of treatment available to inmates at DWCC. Despite being the \nonly  treatment  offered  at  DWCC,  the  Court  nonetheless  finds  there  to  be  systemic \n98 \n   \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 641   Filed 11/01/22   Page 99 of 165 PageID #: \n35325\ndeficiencies  in  the  administration  of  these  psychotropic  medications  for  the  reasons \noutlined below. \nSgt. Paul Pitts (“Sgt. Pitts”) was employed as a Pill Call Officer on the South \nCompound from approximately 2017-2019. Pitts Trial Tr. vol. IV at 866:6-20 [Record \nDocument  538].  Sgt.  Pitts  testified  as  to  the  process  of  administering  psychotropic \nmedication to the inmates. Prior to beginning the role, Sgt. Pitts received one to two days \nof training from a DWCC nurse, where he received hands-on training and the “Pill Pass \nPolicy.” Id. at 869:2-15. The “Pill Pass Policy” or as the PowerPoint Presentation is titled, \nthe “Medication Handling Pill Call Training for Correctional Employees,” is a thirty-one \npage document that discusses medication safety, the process of distributing and reporting \nmedication, and areas of dangers of which the pill call officer must be aware. Ex. P-QQQ-\n03 [Record Document 564-233].  \n  A pill call officer will work seven days, during which he is tasked with distributing \nmedication during all three rounds; the individual is then off duty for seven days, and \nanother pill call officer will work his shifts. Pitts Trial Tr. vol. IV at 875:12-22 [Record \nDocument 538]. There are three pill call rounds per day (during which all buildings will \nbe visited): morning (which begins around 6:00 a.m.), noon, and evening (which begins \naround 4:30-5:00 p.m.). Id. at 874:25-876:1. The nurses provide a list with the names of \neach inmate to receive medication that day. Id. at 887:3-5. The pill call officer pushes the \npill cart with the inmates’ prescription medications. Id. at 879:5-9. He walks through each \ntier, stopping at the  appropriate cells, where he will verify the  inmate’s name,  DOC \nnumber, and ID card before giving medication to the inmate. Id. at 884:12-885:18. The \n99 \n   \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 641   Filed 11/01/22   Page 100 of 165 PageID #: \n35326\npills will  arrive  in a  blister package, which requires  the pill  call  officer  to “pop the \nmedicine out of the blister pack” before administering it to the inmate. Id. at 878:25-\n880:2. The pill call officer then asks the inmate to verify that he has swallowed the \nmedication by asking him to open his mouth, lift his tongue, pull on his gums, lips, and \ncheeks, and show his palms. Id. at 878:24-880:25. The pill call officer will then maintain a \nlist  of  inmates  who  refused  to  take  their  medications  for  later  documentation  in  the \nElectronic Medication Administration Records (“E-MAR”) system. Id. at 887:22-888:10. \nOnce the pill call officer has completed his rounds for the day, the pill cart is locked up in \nthe key room in each building. Id. at 889:1-13. The pill call officer records an inmate’s \nconsumption of medicine (or lack thereof) in the E-MAR system three times per day, after \neach round. Id. 890:22-891:18. Sgt. Pitts stated that during training, he was taught to \nreport medical noncompliance by inputting “N” for “not requested” or “R” for refusal in \nthe E-MAR system. Id. at 911:18-25. Medications may only be discontinued if there is a \n“stop order” in place. Id. at 877:17-22. \nGiven that psychotropic medication is an inmate’s only form of mental health \ntreatment,  it  is  critical  that  its  administration  is  done  correctly.  However,  Dr.  Burns \ntestified that the medication administration program at DWCC fell below the minimum \nstandard  of  care.    See  generally  Burns  Trial  Tr.  vol.  VI  at  1395:8-1407:10  [Record \nDocument 540]. The Court agrees with this for several different reasons. First, there are \ninsufficient mechanisms for reporting a missed dose of medication. The extent of Sgt. \nPitts’s medicine noncompliance reporting was to input the information into the E-MAR \nsystem. Pitts Trial Tr. vol. IV at 896:16-20 [Record Document 538]. Sgt. Pitts would not \n100 \n   \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 641   Filed 11/01/22   Page 101 of 165 PageID #: \n35327\nreport the information to anybody personally. Id. at 896:21-25. He also did not know who, \nif anyone at all, would check the information he input for follow-up, testifying only that \n“I’m guessing medical did.” Id. at 897:1-5. In fact, Dr. Burns recalled that a nurse “who \ndoes the audits, just checks to see that the MAR is actually filed in the chart and [does] not \nlook at what it says.” Burns Trial Tr. vol. VI at 1403:20-1404:2 [Record Document 540].  \nMany inmates at DWCC frequently refuse their medication, as Dr. Burns observed \nduring the review of the medical administration records that are filled out by the pill call \nofficers.  Id. at 1394:17-22. Dr. Burns testified that many of these records indicated that \nthe  medications  were  “refused”  or  “not  requested.”  Id.  at  1394:21-24.  As  Dr.  Seal \nexplained, though it is common for inmates to refuse medication, a missed dose could be \ncause for concern that the medication would not work.67 Seal Trial Tr. vol. V at 1203:25-\n1204:13 [Record Document 539]. The harms associated with medication noncompliance \nare highlighted in the training manual itself; however, the policy stops short of ensuring \nthat there are provisions or requirements  to alleviate that harm.  As illustrated by the \ntestimony of Sgt. Pitts and Dr. Seal outlined below, DWCC has a policy in place that \nrecognizes the importance of regular and consistent medication and administration and has \na method of recording medication administration but has no process by which an inmate’s \n \n67 Dr. Burns agreed with Dr. Seal, noting that “these medications are designed so that they \n. . . be given once a day, and that is important because you want to have a steady state of \nmedication in your bloodstream so that it has the intended effect. If you don’t receive all \nof the doses of medicine, and there were large blocks of time when people didn’t receive \nthe medicine, it can’t have the intended effect.” Burns Trial Tr. vol. VI at 1395:2-12 \n[Record Document 540].  \n101 \n   \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 641   Filed 11/01/22   Page 102 of 165 PageID #: \n35328\nregular or inconsistent medication administration is reported to someone who can address \nthe problem.  \nIndeed,  Sgt.  Pitt’s  testimony  confirmed  this.  During  his  testimony,  Sgt.  Pitts \nreviewed Ex. P-L-124 [Record Document 564-67 at 35], Ex. P-L-122 [Record Document \n564-67 at 33], Ex. P-L-14 [Record Document 564-66 at 14], and Ex. P-L-15 [Record \nDocument 564-66 at 15]. Id. at 920:15-932:11. Ex. P-L-124 [Record Document 564-67 at \n35] is a copy of inmate R.R.’s medication administration records during October 2017. \nSgt. Pitts was questioned regarding R.R.’s Remeron prescription. During the month of \nOctober, R.R. only took seven of thirty-one prescribed doses of Remeron. Id. at 1; see also \nPitts Trial Tr. vol. IV at 921:16-21 [Record Document 538]. Sgt. Pitts testified that he had \nbeen tasked with administering doses that month between October 24, 2017, and October \n29, 2017. Of those six doses, inmate R.R. only took one dose of Remeron. See Ex. P-L-\n124 [Record Document 564-67 at 35]; see also Pitts Trial Tr. vol. IV at 921:16-21 [Record \nDocument 538]. Sgt. Pitts testified that he followed his training by documenting those five \nmissing doses, which is visible in the “N” reported on those given days. Pitts Trial Tr. vol. \nIV  at  922:4-17  [Record  Document  538].  Inmate  T.T.’s  October  2017  medication \nadministration record  provides similar information; T.T. only took his Remeron once \nduring Sgt. Pitt’s six shifts, and eight out of thirty-one doses prescribed for the month. See \nEx. P-L-122 [Record Document 564-67 at 33]; see also Pitts Trial Tr. vol. IV at 923:1-\n924:1 [Record Document 538]. Inmate T.H. took fourteen of sixty-two and fifteen of \nsixty-two prescribed Prolixin and Cogentin doses, respectively, in October 2017. See Exs. \nP-L-14, P-L-15 [Record Document 564-66 at 14, 15]; see also Pitts Trial Tr. vol. IV at \n102 \n   \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 641   Filed 11/01/22   Page 103 of 165 PageID #: \n35329\n926:23-928:25 [Record Document 538]. Sgt. Pitts documented the noncompliance with an \n“N” or “R” in the E-MAR system. See Exs. P-L-14, P-L-15 [Record Document 564-66 at \n14, 15]; see also Pitts Trial Tr. vol. IV at 929:1-6 [Record Document 538]. \nSgt. Pitts indicated in his testimony that he relied on his training to properly record \nmedicine noncompliance. Pitts Trial Tr. vol. IV at 922:4-17 [Record Document 538]. \nHowever, the Louisiana Department of  Correction’s training  materials for medication \nadministration does not provide pill call officers any real guidance in how they should \ntreat  medicine  noncompliance.  The  exact  language  of  the  policy,  titled  “Medication \nHandling  Pill  Call  Training  for  Correctional  Employees,”  states  that  “appropriate \ndocumentation is to be entered on MAR/E-MAR for all refused medications.” Ex. P-\nQQQ-03 at 6 [Record Document 564-233]. On the next page, it states “Psyciatric [sic] \nMedication Non-compliance: 3 consecutive missed doses; and/or an obvious pattern of \nmissed doses. Example: offender misses every other day or evening dose.” Id. at 7. The \npolicy neither outlines what the pill call officer should do with information on medicine \nnoncompliance, nor does it provide a system for reporting this information (e.g., to whom \nthe information should be reported, when should the information be reported, how the \ninformation should be reported, etc.). Thus, the information that pill call officers receive \nduring  their  training  fails  to  provide  adequate  instructions  on  what  to  do  in  these \nsituations.  \nDr. Burns explained that she would typically expect that mental health staff or \nnurses would review inmate records to detect a missed dose of medication. Burns Trial Tr. \nvol.  VI  at  1395:8-1397:12  [Record  Document  540].  The  psychiatrist  would  then  be \n103 \n   \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 641   Filed 11/01/22   Page 104 of 165 PageID #: \n35330\ninformed  after  a  certain  amount  of  missed  doses  so  that  an  appointment  could  be \nscheduled  to  address  medication  noncompliance.  Id.  at  1396:8-1397:18.  Generally, \nintervention  should  occur  as  soon  as  possible,  though  the  exact  timing  would  vary \ndepending on the type of medication. Id. at 1398:18-24. Clearly, this did not occur at \nDWCC; in fact, DWCC’s practices were in derogation of the overall rules governing the \nmedical administration.68 The risk of harm becomes obvious in that not only is there harm \nto the patient who could experience a recurrence or worsening of symptoms, but it can \nalso lead him to be written up or disciplined. See Burns Trial Tr. vol. VI at 1399:13-23 \n[Record Document 540].  This is because “their behavior, which can be symptomatic of \nuntreated mental illness, is being perceived as negative and receiving writeups.” Id. at \n1399:21-26. This also poses a risk to the staff and others at DWCC.   \nNot only was there no follow-up for medical noncompliance, but Dr. Seal did not \neven have access to E-MAR and did not know whether a printed copy of the MAR was in \nevery relevant inmate chart. Seal Trial Tr. vol. V at 1201:14-1202:11 [Record Document \n539]. Instead, he had access to older records printed off at the end of each prior month.  \nHe also did not know what the “N” and “R” in the E-MAR printouts indicated. Id. at \n1202:23-1203:4. This concerned Dr. Burns, and she noted that a failure to understand \nthese notations would make it impossible to interpret the records. Burns Trial Tr. vol. VI \nat  1402:10-15  [Record  Document  540].  Dr.  Burns  opined  that  it  should  be  the \n \n68 Hayden testified that he reviews the printed E-MAR every morning “to see who is \ntaking their medicine and who is not. And if they are not taking their medicine then that is \nsomething that Dr. Seal is made aware of.” Hayden Trial Tr. vol. III at 555:11-18 [Record \nDocument 536]. However, neither Dr. Seal’s testimony, nor the record corroborates this \nstatement. \n104 \n   \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 641   Filed 11/01/22   Page 105 of 165 PageID #: \n35331\nresponsibility of the mental health staff to develop some sort of system that coordinates \nwith medical and pharmacy to ensure that the prescriber, that is Dr. Seal, has access to this \ninformation. Id. at 1402:16-23.  \nFinally, it is evident that the pill call officer is not adequately supervised. Sgt. Pitts \nis not supervised by a nurse or anyone on the mental health staff, but instead, by the \nsecurity captains. See Pitts Trial Tr. vol. IV at 945:5-9 [Record Document 538]. The \ncaptains are the individuals ensuring that Sgt. Pitts is conducting the rounds, filling out the \ntier logs, and is on time to all distributions. Id. at 945:10-21. These individuals are not \ncompetent  to  oversee  medication  management.  Burns  Trial  Tr.  vol.  VI  at  1403:5-15 \n[Record Document 540]. The individuals that would be qualified, that is, the nurses or \nmental health department, simply check to ensure that the MAR is filled out. Thus, there is \nno audit of Sgt. Pitt’s record keeping or his work.  \nThe  Court  finds  that  the  systemic  deficiencies  visible  in  the  administration  of \npsychotropic medications—the lack of adequate guidance through training and relevant \nmaterials, the absence of any systems of reporting or subsequent follow-up for medicine \nnoncompliance, a failure to audit or provide quality assurance of the pill call officers’ job \nperformance or records, and the fact that Dr. Seal does not have access to the E-MAR \nsystem—rise to the level of a constitutional violation.  \n(e)  Lack of Accurate and Adequate Medical Records \nThe Court has already noted several issues with respect to the accuracy of medical \nrecords. These include concerns of duplicating records, the reporting of information in the \nmedical records and medicinal administration records (and lack thereof), inconsistencies \n105 \n   \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 641   Filed 11/01/22   Page 106 of 165 PageID #: \n35332\nbetween records on the same day, and illegible writing within those records. However, the \nbroader topic of Dr. Seal’s own record keeping, and what it indicates, should be addressed \nin further depth. Dr. Burns opined, and this Court agrees, that Dr. Seal does not maintain \nthe requisite quality and quantity of record keeping that his role requires. Patient records \nare missing medical consent forms and documentation outlining the benefits and risks in \ntaking  a  psychotropic  medication.    Burns  Trial  Tr.  vol.  VI  at  1406:14-21  [Record \nDocument 540]. Additionally, there is no documentation that otherwise reflects Dr. Seal’s \nparticipation in any treatment team meetings or intervention development, which would be \nthe  typical  responsibilities  of  a  prison  psychiatrist.  Id.  at  1407:22-1408:4.  Dr.  Burns \ntestified that this is imperative because “the psychiatrist, again, is the person that has the \nmost education and credential and training to do mental health care. And it is important \nthat the person with that be available and mentor other people in that process. They can \nalso make recommendations to improve processes.” Id. at 1408:16-1409:2. Dr. Burns \nstated that she did not see any of Dr. Seal’s recommendations documented in writing. Id. \nat  1409:14-24.  Comparing  inmate  records  to  a  story,  the  lack  of  appropriate \ndocumentation leaves a record riddled with plot holes and inconsistencies. Id. at 1409:23-\n1410:10. Given that Dr. Seal is the only individual qualified to diagnose and prescribe \nmedication, the only type of treatment at DWCC, meticulous documentation is required so \nthat  mental  health  staff  can  carry  out  his  directives.  The  failure  to  accurately  and \nappropriately complete inmate records, in conjunction with the aforementioned record \nkeeping issues, rise to the level of a constitutional violation.  \n106 \n   \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 641   Filed 11/01/22   Page 107 of 165 PageID #: \n35333\n(f)  Suicide Prevention Program \n   Courts have held that prisons must have adequate suicide prevention policies to \nprovide constitutional care. Ruiz, 503 F. Supp. at 1339; Braggs v. Dunn, 257 F. Supp. 3d \n1171,  1219  (M.D.  Ala.  2017);  Madrid,  889  F.  Supp.  at  1258.  “The  identification, \ntreatment, and supervision of inmates with suicidal tendencies is a necessary component \nof  any  mental  health  treatment  program.”  Ruiz,  503  F.  Supp.  at  1339.  The  suicide \nprevention policies at DWCC fail to meet any of these objectives; both Dr. Haney and Dr. \nBurns credibly established that inmates are exposed to cruel conditions on the South \nCompound. Haney Trial Tr. vol. XII at 2735:2-4 [Record Document 553]; see also Burns \nTrial Tr. vol. VI at 1450:9-13 [Record Document 540]. The Court agrees, as evidence \nshows  that  DWCC’s  suicide  prevention  policies  and  practices  are  constitutionally \ninadequate. \ni.  The Punitive Nature of the Suicide Prevention Program \nAt DWCC, there are two forms of suicide watch: standard and extreme. Ex. J-10 at \n6 [Record Document 565-17]. Standard suicide watch is for “the management of offenders \nwho are at risk for suicide but do not present a clear and continual risk of self-injurious \nbehavior(s).” Id. at 4. Extreme suicide watch is “for the management of offenders who \npresent a clear and continual risk of self-injurious behavior.” Id. DWCC’s post order \nrequires mental health staff to utilize the “least restrictive” means necessary to preventing \nan  inmate’s  injury,  and  it  also  requires  consultation  with  mental  health  staff  before \nmodifying  suicide  watch  status.  Id.  at  7-8.  Mental  health  staff  are  also  tasked  with \n“determin[ing] the appropriate security garment(s) that, to the extent possible, promote the \n107 \n   \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 641   Filed 11/01/22   Page 108 of 165 PageID #: \n35334\noffender’s safety in way that is designed to prevent humiliation and degradation.” Ex. J-10 \nat 4 [Record Document 565-17]. The Court finds the nature of the suicide prevention \nprogram  at  DWCC  to  be  punitive,  as  opposed  to  a  realistic  and  practical  form  of \ntreatment. Among the reasons, the rest of which are discussed below, is the identical \nnature of the conditions of suicide watch and strip cell status. \nStandard  suicide  watch  subjects  inmates  to  the  same  conditions  as  strip  cell \nstatus—meaning all property is removed from the cell, including mattresses and clothing; \nall inmates are given paper gowns. Hayden Trial Tr. vol. II at 430:14-431:25 [Record \nDocument 534]; accord Burns Trial Tr. vol. VI at 1357:6-20 [Record Document 540]. \nThis is especially the case for those inmates on “manipulation suicide watch,” which is \nwhen “the offender is looking for a cell move or if they are aggravated with staff . . . and \nif they won’t tell us why they have actually moved and why they have done this, we don’t \nknow exactly what to expect of them.” Id. at 432:9-21. Hayden did not elaborate on the \nmethods of evaluation or assessment tools used by the mental health staff to determine \nwhether an inmate is being manipulative or is legitimately suicidal, which is alarming. \nAccording to Hayden, if it is determined that an inmate should be placed on “manipulative \nsuicide watch,” his property is taken from him; however, if an inmate is determined to be \nlegitimately suicidal, some property will be given to him. Id. at 432:9-433:20. This makes \nno logical sense and clearly demonstrates that the allowance or removal of property is not \nan  individualized  determination  based  on  personal  security,  but  instead,  is  another \ndisciplinary  tactic  used  to  punish  inmates,  further  highlighting  the  punitive  nature  of \nsuicide watch.  \n108 \n   \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 641   Filed 11/01/22   Page 109 of 165 PageID #: \n35335\nDr.  Haney  testified  that  the  removal  of  the  inmate’s  clothing  was  “cruel,” \nineffective, and “delegitimizes the formal disciplinary system.” Haney Trial Tr. vol. XII at \n2735:2-9  [Record Document 553]. Dr. Burns testified that the conditions  of standard \nsuicide watch mirror that of strip cell status such that one cannot tell the status of the \ninmate by merely looking at him, signaling to inmates that suicide watch is a punitive \nsetting and dissuades inmates from accurately reporting suicidal ideation. Burns Trial Tr. \nvol. VI at 1360:1-20 [Record Document 540].  \nOn extreme suicide watch, inmates are clothed in a paper gown and have no access \nto any property, including mattresses, letters, or books. Record Document 524 ¶ 107. \nAdditionally, prisoners on extreme suicide watch may be placed in restraints while in a \ncell alone. See id. at ¶¶ 108, 110. Restraints used on extreme suicide watch include: \n(1) four-point restraints, which consist of both hands being cuffed with the \nchain  for  the  cuffs  connected  to  a  box  at  the  mid-section,  designed  to \nprevent movement or tampering, a belly chain connected to the handcuff \nchain, and shackles on the ankles; (2) placing a prisoner in a restraint chair, \nwhich attaches each limb to the chair; or (3) the placing of the prisoner in a \nrestraint  chair,  as  above,  with  a  helmet  to  prevent  spitting  and  head \nbanging.  \nRecord Document 524 ¶ 108.  The restraint chair may be used for up to twelve hours if \napproved through the adequate channels. Id. at ¶ 113. During that twelve-hour window, an \ninmate  must  be  released  every  two  hours  “for  toilet,  sanitation,  and  nourishment \nfunctions.” Id. at ¶ 115. After twelve hours, mental health staff must conduct a medical \nand mental health assessment to determine whether the restraint chair must continue to be \nused, modified in its use, or terminated. Id. at ¶114. If an inmate cannot safely be released \n109 \n   \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 641   Filed 11/01/22   Page 110 of 165 PageID #: \n35336\nfrom the restraint chair after five, two-hour cycles, the policy requires that he be restrained \nin a different way before returning him back to the chair. Id. at ¶ 116.  \nDWCC’s extreme suicide practices plainly deviate from its own internal policies. \nRecord Document 524 ¶¶ 111-16. By way of example, inmate C.T. testified as to his \nexperience  on  extreme  suicide  watch,  describing  a  three-day  cycle  where  he  was \nrestrained in the chair, he was taken off the chair and put into his cell alone in restraints, \nand then he attempted suicide. Turner Trial Transcript vol. I at 94:16-101:12 [Record \nDocument 533]. During that time, C.T. testified that he spent “no less than 24 hours, no \nmore than 30 hours” in the restraint chair. Id. at 100:11-16.  C.T.’s experience in the \nrestraint chair ran afoul of internal policy.  \nNot  only  do  DWCC’s  extreme  suicide  watch  practices  deviate  from  its  own \npolicies, but they also do not meet the minimum standard of mental health care. First, \nDWCC’s  practice  of  taking  away  all  property  and  bedding  is  not  a  widely  used  or \naccepted process; the failure to tailor decisions regarding clothing, property, and bedding \nto each inmate is a deviation from basic principles of mental health care. See generally \nBurns Trial Tr. vol. V at 1349:16-1350:10 [Record Document 539]; accord Pacholke Trial \nTr. vol. XII at 2731:5-17 [Record Document 553].69 Second, Dr. Burns testified that the \nuse of steel security restraints for suicide watch is foreign to any suicide watch that she \nhas observed. Burns Trial Tr. vol. V at 1376:4-11 [Record Document 539]. Dr. Burns \nfurther testified that if an inmate’s risk to himself was so severe that he required restraint, \n \n69 Secretary Pacholke relied on both “ACA standards and certainly my tours of, you know, \nover 13 different jurisdictions in the last few years” to make this assertion. Pacholke Trial \nTr. vol. XII at 2731:15-17 [Record Document 553].  \n110 \n   \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 641   Filed 11/01/22   Page 111 of 165 PageID #: \n35337\nthen he should be placed in a health care setting with therapeutic restraints, such as \nleather, because he needs to be monitored by a medical professional. See id. at 1371:14-\n1372:17; accord Pacholke Trial Tr. vol. XII at 2750:11-2751:16 [Record Document 553]. \nDr. Thompson agreed, stating that he would recommend that leather restraints be utilized \ninstead of the current restraint mechanisms, including the chair. Thompson Trial Tr. vol. \nXVII at 4053:17-19 [Record Document 561]. Additionally, Dr. Thompson testified that \nthe use of the restraint chair was neither a “best practice” nor a “common practice.” Id. at \n4052:14-4053:10. Dr. Burns also highlighted the potential harm in using a restraint chair, \nstating that “people get blood clots and there have been deaths in restraint chairs in other \ncorrectional settings.”  Burns Trial Tr. vol. V at 1372:18-21 [Record Document 539]. \nThese suicide watch practices are so egregious and cruel that they rise to the level of an \nEighth Amendment violation.  \nii.  Lack of Meaningful Treatment \nThe Court also finds that the evidence presented at trial demonstrated a lack of \nmeaningful  treatment  plans  for  those on standard  suicide and  extreme  suicide  watch. \nAdditionally, the Court finds that there is no initial assessment before placing an inmate \non  suicide  watch,  no  treatment  for  inmates  while  on  suicide  watch,  and  there  is  no \nassessment or treatment before the inmate is removed from suicide watch. \nFirst, DWCC violates acceptable prison practices by failing to conduct a suicide \nrisk assessment. Dr. Burns explained what she believed was an appropriate process for \nputting an inmate on suicide watch. Burns Trial Tr. vol. V at 1350:11-1351:1 [Record \nDocument 539]. There should be a low threshold for placing an inmate on suicide watch \n111 \n   \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 641   Filed 11/01/22   Page 112 of 165 PageID #: \n35338\nbecause it is better to be overly cautious than risk an inmate taking his own life. Id. at \n1350:13-16.  Mental  health  staff  should  then  follow  up  with  a  more  comprehensive \nassessment to determine “the level of risk [the inmate] presents . . . what level of watch \nand property can be provided.” Id. at 1350:16-1351:1.70 These assessments should be \nconfidential  so  that  the  risk  of  disclosing  highly  personal  information  around  other \ninmates is mitigated. Id. at 1355:23-1356:3. The assessment should then be documented in \nthe inmate’s chart, including “all of the items that the person is assessing risk about, \nwhether there are static factor or dynamic factors that can be addressed and treated.” Id. at \n1355:5-7.  \nThe evidence shows that mental health staff fail to conduct a proper, standard \nsuicide risk assessment. First, Dr. Burns testified that Hayden is currently not qualified to \nconduct the suicide risk assessments, though he could be if he were adequately trained by \na  licensed  professional  who  would  be  consulted  when  removing  an  individual  from \nsuicide watch. See generally id. at 1354:12-21. Second, Dr. Burns testified that there was \nno evidence that a standard suicide risk assessment is conducted at DWCC because the \nonly documentation in the records she reviewed were progress notes, and even those did \nnot indicate an evaluation occurred. Id. at 1355:3-18. There was no indication that Hayden \nconducted an evaluation based on the inmate’s individual needs and mental health history, \nid.  at  1357:10-11,  despite  DWCC’s  policy  requiring  officials  to  employ  the  least \nrestrictive means necessary to prevent inmate injury. An individualized approach to a \n \n70 An adequate assessment would include questions such as whether an inmate is partaking \nin harmful behaviors and whether there is opportunity to self-harm. Burns Trial Tr. vol. V \nat 1356:14-1357:5 [Record Document 539]. \n112 \n   \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 641   Filed 11/01/22   Page 113 of 165 PageID #: \n35339\nsuicide assessment would reveal it is safe for an inmate to possess a mattress or a mat. Id. \nat 1357:10-13. \nAdditionally,  there  is  no  treatment  available  to  people  on  suicide  watch.  As \npreviously mentioned, there is no other type of treatment available to inmates at DWCC \nother than the administration of psychotropic medication. Inmates on suicide watch do not \nreceive individual or group therapy, nor are they allowed to partake in in-cell or out-of-\ncell programming.  Dr. Seal’s  testimony revealed  that he  did not make  any decisions \nregarding the conditions on suicide watch, did not decide when an inmate should be \nremoved from suicide watch, and did not know the differences between standard and \nextreme suicide watch. Seal Trial Tr. vol. For example, an individualized approach to a \nsuicide assessment would reveal whether an individual can have a mattress or a mat. Id. at \n1357:10-13.  at 1226:5-21. Tellingly, while being asked about suicide watch, Dr. Seal \nstated that “my job is to diagnose and to provide medication.” Id. at 1227:9-10. The Court \nconcludes that the harm to the patient is obvious in that the patient is not receiving the \nappropriate treatment. The Court is convinced that Dr. Seal is the only person who has the \ncredentials to make diagnosis and treatment recommendations, and yet, the record showed \nvery little evidence demonstrating Dr. Seal’s role or impact in the suicide prevention \nprogram at DWCC. Further, treatment and the use of restraints at DWCC, Dr. Burns aptly \nnoted that “[n]o one feels better because they have been tied down in a restraint chair or \nplaced into steel handcuffs and leg irons. So it is more suffering . . . It is not helpful in \nterms of addressing the underlying issue that is making the person suicidal.” Burns Trial \nTr. vol. V at 1373:11-17 [Record Document 539]. \n113 \n   \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 641   Filed 11/01/22   Page 114 of 165 PageID #: \n35340\nThe damaging effects of DWCC’s suicide prevention program are highlighted by \ninmate  T.M.’s  three  weeks  on  suicide  watch.  Dr.  Galvin,  a  board-certified  internal \nmedicine doctor, testified about the changes he witnessed in inmate T.M.’s behavior after \nbeing placed on suicide watch. Galvin Trial Tr. vol. XII at 2834:17-18 [Record Document \n553].71 Dr. Galvin was incarcerated at DWCC from approximately January to May 2016. \nId. at 2835:4-7. Dr. Galvin met inmate T.M. at EHCC before they were transferred to \nDWCC.72 Dr. Galvin explained the personality changes he noticed in T.M. as their time at \nDWCC  progressed.  Specifically,  Dr.  Galvin  stated  that  T.M.  “became  increasingly \nagitated, restless, was unable to sleep . . . [a]nd he knew something was wrong because he \nwas . . . getting into some disagreements and couldn’t control his speech and was . . . \nverbally aggressive . . . blurting things out, couldn’t be patient.” Id. at 2836:19-2837:1. Dr. \nGalvin states that the “pivotal event” was a time where T.M. was speaking very loudly: \n[P]eople got tired of hearing him . . . it escalated to the point that somebody \nsaid “well he’s spitting on people.” And they had basically what people call \na shakedown and it was a little bit of a violent shakedown where they came \nin, several of the guards, and took his possessions away and whisked him \naway for about a week or so. \nId. at 2837:5-23. Although Dr. Galvin did not know where the guards took T.M., he said \nthat he was told that T.M. was taken to the restraint chair. Id. at 2837:25-2838:3. Witness \ntestimony and records maintained by DWCC corroborate Dr. Galvin’s testimony. There is \n \n71 Dr. Gavin was housed in N-5, which is outside of the scope of consideration in this \nmatter. Nevertheless, the information that was provided during Dr. Gavin’s testimony is \nrelevant to the issues in this litigation. \n72 Inmate T.M. submitted a waiver to allow his medical and mental health records to be \nadmitted into evidence and utilized during this case. However, out of respect to the \nsensitive nature of this discussion and the information it reveals therein, the inmate’s name \nwill not be disclosed here.  \n114 \n   \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 641   Filed 11/01/22   Page 115 of 165 PageID #: \n35341\nevidence  of  T.M.  being  placed  on  suicide  watch  during  the  time  of  Dr.  Galvin’s \nincarceration at DWCC. During those three weeks, records indicate that inmate T.M. was \nplaced  in  the  restraint  chair.  Id.  at  1869:1-20.  There  are  also  multiple  documented \ninstances of chemical spray being used on him. Nail Trial Tr. vol. VIII at 1857:16-1866:2 \n[Record Document 542] (describing all the documented instances where chemical spray \nwas used on T.M., including testimony as to how many ounces were sprayed each time); \nsee also Ex. P-D-2 [Record Document 564-6].  \nDr. Galvin testified that T.M. was “profoundly and irrevocably changed” when \nT.M. returned to the unit. Galvin Trial Tr. vol. XII at 2838:8-9 [Record Document 553]. \nHe described the first time he saw T.M. on his way to the showers: \nHe was standing up on, you know, the one foot or so elevation concrete bed \nwith a paper gown on with his entire backside exposed, with his buttocks \nexposed. His nose was in the corner of the cinderblock wall, and he was \nonly  making  guttural  sounds.  He  wasn’t  speaking  anymore.  It  was  a \nprofound and dramatic change. Something clearly happened.   \nId.  at  2838:11-17.  The  Court  found  Dr.  Galvin’s  observations  to  be  credible  and \ncompelling for several reasons. First, Dr. Galvin’s testimony that T.M. was “taken away” \naligns with his short period of incarceration at DWCC, testimony by officials at DWCC, \nand documents produced at trial. Dr. Galvin’s observations are also consistent with the \ndamaging effects of utilizing disciplinary measures on inmates with mental health issues \nwithout prior consultation of mental health staff, as well as the harm caused by DWCC’s \nsuicide prevention program. The Court finds Dr. Galvin’s testimony to be further evidence \nof the systemic deficiencies in DWCC’s suicide prevention program.  \n115 \n   \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 641   Filed 11/01/22   Page 116 of 165 PageID #: \n35342\n  Finally, DWCC has no assessment or method of evaluation to remove an inmate \nfrom standard suicide watch. Hayden testified that if an inmate indicates that he no longer \nwants to remain on suicide watch, he will be removed. See Hayden Trial Tr. vol. III at \n581:6-18  [Record  Document 536]. When asked about the changes that took place  to \nprompt inmate C.T.’s removal from suicide watch, Hayden simply stated that “he no \nlonger wanted to be on standard suicide watch.” Id. at 581:15-18. If an inmate is suicidal, \nhe should not be removed from suicide watch simply because he no longer wants to be \nthere; indeed, this is completely counterintuitive and contrary to the goal of suicide watch, \nwhich is to prevent an inmate from committing suicide. This just further highlights the \nlack of treatment or care available to inmates at DWCC.   \nAccordingly, the Court finds that the complete lack of standard suicide assessment \nand failure to create an individualized treatment plans—specifically, the lack of initial \nassessment before placement on suicide watch, the lack of treatment available to inmates \nwhile on suicide watch, and the failure to evaluate inmates before they are removed from \nsuicide  watch—are  indicative  of  the  widespread  systemic  deficiencies  in  the  suicide \nprevention program at DWCC.  \niii.  Failures in Observing Inmates on Suicide Watch \nFinally, the Court finds that there are failures in the observation of inmates on \nsuicide watch that rise to the level of a constitutional violation. First, DWCC’s camera \nmonitoring processes are not currently aligned with basic practices across correctional \ninstitutions. According to a DWCC post order on suicide prevention and management, \n“frequency of observation shall be included in the management instructions and shall vary \n116 \n   \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 641   Filed 11/01/22   Page 117 of 165 PageID #: \n35343\nfrom continual observation to intervals of [fifteen] minutes or less. Within the prescribed \ninterval, irregular additional observations shall be made on an occasional, random basis to \nfrustrate the planning of self-injurious acts.” Ex. J-10 at 6 [Record Document 565-17]. At \nDWCC, individuals on suicide watch are supposedly either observed continuously through \ncameras by the tier sergeant or in-person every fifteen minutes by a tier officer. See \nHayden Trial Tr. vol. II at 390:7-10 [Record Document 534]. The individual monitoring \nthe cameras on each tier has various other tasks, including letting individuals in and out of \nthe tiers and recording tier visitors in the logbooks. Id. at 392:6-393:11. The tier officer \nwill also fill out the suicide watch logbooks. Id. at 397:3-11. Mental health staff do not \nobserve the inmates personally but will sometimes review the logbooks. Id. at 390:17-20, \n397:12-14.  \nIn  her  testimony,  Dr.  Burns  stated  that  DWCC’s  level  of  observation  violates \nacceptable  practices  for  observation  of  inmates  on  suicide  watch.  Her  reasoning  is \ncompelling. First, Dr. Burns personally observed that the cameras at DWCC do not always \nwork. She testified that “[n]ot all the cameras were in working order and . . . there were \nsome places within the cell that are not visible on the camera, just blind spots based upon \nwhere the camera is located in the cell itself.” Burns Trial Tr. vol. V at 1359:9-15 [Record \nDocument 539]. Furthermore, while observing the same cells from the camera feed, Dr. \nBurns noticed that it was difficult finding the correct cell and camera to get a good view in \na specific cell. Id. at 1359:16-25. Even if the cameras did work, Dr. Burns stated that it is \ngenerally  recommended  that  camera  monitoring  be  used  in  addition  to  “face  to  face \nassessments.” Id. at 1357:21-1358:1. This is because an inmate should be well aware that \n117 \n   \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 641   Filed 11/01/22   Page 118 of 165 PageID #: \n35344\nhe is constantly being watched, which will help prevent suicide attempts. Id. at 1358:1-8. \nThe lack of working cameras and a clear view of each monitored cell is imperative for \ncamera monitoring to work successfully. Without routine face-to-face monitoring, the \nreliance  on  cameras  puts  these  inmates  at  risk.  The  inadequacy  of  the  systems  for \nmonitoring inmates, along with the lack of treatment for inmates on suicide watch and the \nimproper  use  of  restraints,  are  sufficient  evidence  for  this  Court  to  find  an  Eighth \nAmendment violation.  \n2.  Deliberate Indifference  \nHaving found that there are substantial, systemic deficiencies in all six aspects of \nmental health care at DWCC—screening and evaluations, effective and individualized \ntreatment,  adequate  staffing,  safeguards  to  the  prescription  and  distribution  of \npsychotropic medications, accurate record keeping, and the creation and maintenance of a \nsuicide prevention program—the Court will now address the deliberate indifference prong \nof  the  Eighth  Amendment  inquiry.  Using  the  same  deliberate  indifference  standard \npreviously articulated, the Court finds that the evidence demonstrates the existence of \ndeliberate indifference in all six of the Ruiz categories. The evidence presented at trial \nhighlights common themes throughout these six categories. First, throughout this section, \nthe Court has noted the failure of the mental health staff to follow its own policies. The \nexistence of an institution-wide policy is proof of knowledge of a specific, substantial risk \nof  harm.  The  Court  finds  that  the  staff  at  DWCC  have  made  a  conscious,  informed \ndecision  not  to  comply  with  DOC  and  DWCC  internal  policy,  despite  firsthand \nknowledge, education, and training that their actions would result in a substantial risk of \n118 \n   \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 641   Filed 11/01/22   Page 119 of 165 PageID #: \n35345\nharm. Second, Defendants’ actions clearly evince a wanton disregard of inmates’ serious \nmental health needs.  The Court will briefly address DWCC’s failure  to comply with \ninternal policy and instances of wanton disregard below.  \n(a)  Failure to Comply with Policy \nThe Court found evidence that DWCC staff consciously decided to not comply \nwith its policies. First, DWCC mental health staff do not comply with Employee Policy \nMemorandum  #03-02-003  which  requires  that  DWCC  conduct  walking  rounds  at  a \nminimum of three times per week in units housing LOC-2 inmates. Ex. J-7 at 6 [Record \nDocument 565-13]. No evidence was produced at trial that demonstrated compliance with \nthis policy. Employee Policy Memorandum #03-02-003 also requires that LOC-2, LOC-3, \nand LOC-4 inmates receive an individual mental health evaluation every 30, 90, and 180 \ndays, respectively. Id. at 6-7. Again, no evidence was produced at trial that would indicate \nthat these evaluations occur. This policy also requires mental health staff to create an \n“individualized,  written  mental  health  treatment  plan”  that,  at  minimum,  is  reviewed \nannually for each inmate with a LOC-2, LOC-3, and LOC-4 designation. Id. at 9. The \nCourt did not review a single individualized treatment plan, and in fact, witnesses on both \nsides testified that DWCC creates no  such treatment  plans.  Finally,  Employee  Policy \nMemorandum #03-02-003 states that mental health services are available to inmates upon \nrequest, id. at 8, and yet, only psychotropic medications are provided. The Court finds that \nDWCC does not comply with any of the four provisions required by Employee Policy \nMemorandum #03-02-003.  \n119 \n   \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 641   Filed 11/01/22   Page 120 of 165 PageID #: \n35346\nFurthermore, DWCC mental health staff do not comply with policies governing \nsuicide watch. Employee Policy Memorandum #03-02-001 requires that mental health \nstaff “utilize[e] the least restrictive management necessary to prevent an inmate’s self-\nharm.” Ex. J-10 at 7, 8  [Record Document 565-17]. However,  DWCC  implements a \ngeneralized approach to suicide prevention; there are no individualized assessments to \ndetermine what “least restrictive” means are required for a particular inmate on suicide \nwatch. Mental health staff also violate DWCC policy by forcing inmates to sit in the \nrestraint chair for longer than permitted and without the requisite breaks. Finally, security \nstaff at DWCC do not observe inmates as required by Employee Policy Memorandum \n#03-02-001. Employee Policy Memorandum #03-02-001 requires “continuous observation \nof the offender” at frequencies that vary between “continual observation to intervals of \n[fifteen] minutes or less.” Ex. J-10 at 6 [Record Document 565-17]. As was previously \nmentioned, some cameras in the cells used for suicide watch are inoperable, making it \nimpossible  for  DWCC  to  comply  with  this  policy.  The  purpose  of  Employee  Policy \nMemorandum #03-02-001 is to offer procedures and mechanisms for protecting DWCC’s \nmost at-risk inmates and preventing inmate injury and death.73 DWCC’s failure to comply \n \n73 Specifically, the purpose of Employee Policy Memorandum #03-02-00 is “[t]o establish \na formal policy and a written suicide prevention plan for DWCC to manage inmates who \ndisplay suicidal tendencies or behavior and to establish a formal procedure for staff and \noffender critical incident debriefing that covers the management of suicidal incidents. To \nprovide guidelines at DWCC under which restraints are employed on offenders in an \nauthorized and safe manner as part of a health care regimen.” Ex. J-10 at 1 [Record \ndocument 565-17]. The policy goes on to stating that “It is critical that staff understand \nthat the use of restraints [sic] mental health purposes is designed to control destructive \nand/or dangerously aggressive behaviors.” Id. (emphasis added).  \n120 \n   \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 641   Filed 11/01/22   Page 121 of 165 PageID #: \n35347\nwith  one  of  its  most  important  policies  further  demonstrates  its  indifference  towards \ninmate health and safety. \nDWCC officials also disregard the risks and harms outlined in its training for \nmedication  administration,  specifically,  the  Pill  Call  Training  for  Correctional \nEmployees. The Pill Call Training for Correctional Employees outlines, at length, the \nrisks  associated  with  inmate  medication  noncompliance.  Ex.  P-QQQ-03  [Record \nDocument 564-233]. The policy acknowledges those risks and  cautions employees of \nmedication noncompliance, and yet, the policy itself shows that there is no procedure or \nprocess  in  place  to  further  avoid  or  to  mitigate  these  harms.  This  serves  as  further \nevidence of DWCC’s deliberate indifference toward inmate mental health.  \n(b)  Wanton Disregard for Inmate Health and Safety \nThe Court finds evidence of DWCC mental health staff’s wanton disregard for \ninmates’ health and safety in each of the six Ruiz categories.  \nAs to the screening and intake process, the Court’s finding of wanton disregard of \ninmate health and safety is supported by: 1) Hayden’s lack of qualifications to conduct the \ninitial assessments required by the intake process; 2) the inadequacy of the initial intake \nforms; 3) the failure to ask meaningful questions during intake evaluations; 4) the lack of \nmeaningful review of intake evaluations by a qualified mental health professional; 5) the \nlack of timely and meaningful follow-up of intake evaluations by mental health staff; 6) \nthe failure of mental health staff to address an inmate’s individual needs at intake; 7) the \n121 \n   \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 641   Filed 11/01/22   Page 122 of 165 PageID #: \n35348\nfailure  of  the  mental  health  staff  to  conduct  weekly  rounds;74  8)  Hayden’s  lack  of \nqualifications to conduct the thirty- and ninety-day segregated housing interviews; 9) the \ncell-front,  non-confidential  nature  of  the  segregated  housing  interviews;  10)  the \ninadequate evaluation of mental health status during segregated housing interviews; and \n11) the untimely execution of the segregated housing interviews.  \nAs to mental health treatment, the Court’s finding of wanton disregard of inmate \nhealth and safety is supported by 1) the location of the psychiatric appointments with Dr. \nSeal; 2) the lack of confidentiality during psychiatric appointments; 3) the inadequate \namount  of  time  spent  on  psychiatric  appointments;  and  4)  the  inadequate  and \ninappropriate therapeutic materials provided to inmates at DWCC.  \nAs to mental health staffing, the Court’s finding of wanton disregard of inmate \nhealth and safety is supported by 1) the failure to contract with a psychiatrist for the \nnumber of hours necessary to fulfill the demand of DWCC’s mental health caseload; 2) \nthe failure to adequately staff the mental health department; and 3) the failure to provide \nDr. Seal with the information needed for meaningful psychiatric appointments, especially \ninformation relating to suicide watch and strip cell status.   \nAs  to  the  administration  of  psychotropic  medications,  the  Court’s  finding  of \nwanton disregard of inmate health and safety is supported by 1) the lack of processes by \nwhich  an  inmate’s  missed  medication  administration  can  be  addressed  or  remedied, \n \n74 Deputy Warden Dauzat testified that mental health staff at DWCC are required to \ncomplete weekly rounds on every tier. Dauzat Trial Tr. vol. XV at 3354:22-3355:4 \n[Record Document 556]. However, the Court could not independently verify this with the \nwritten policies admitted into evidence.  \n122 \n   \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 641   Filed 11/01/22   Page 123 of 165 PageID #: \n35349\ndespite written materials that warn of the dangers; 2) the failure to provide Dr. Seal with \naccurate, up-to-date printed MARs for psychiatric appointments; and 3) Dr. Seal’s lack of \ntraining and access to the E-MAR system.   \nAs to DWCC’s maintenance of adequate and accurate patient records, the Court’s \nfinding of wanton disregard of inmate health and safety is supported by 1) the instances of \ninmate record duplication; 2) Dr. Seal’s illegible notes; 3) inaccuracies in various inmate \nforms and mental health evaluations; and 4) the failure to maintain a list of inmates on the \nmental health caseload.   \nAs to the suicide prevention program, the Court’s finding of wanton disregard of \ninmate health and safety is supported by 1) the punitive nature of suicide watch; 2) the \nconditions of extreme suicide watch, specifically the use of restraints; 3) the failure to \ndevelop a treatment plan for inmates specifically on suicide watch; 4) the lack of mental \nhealth assessment immediately after an inmate is placed on suicide watch; 5) the lack of \ntreatment during an inmate’s stay on suicide watch; and 6) the lack of assessment by a \nqualified mental health provider when someone is taken off suicide watch.  \nDespite their education, training, and knowledge, the Court finds that DWCC and \nDOC have exhibited deliberate indifference to inmate mental health care and treatment at \nDWCC, satisfying the second prong of the Eighth Amendment analysis. This widespread, \ncruel indifference towards the mental health care and treatment of inmates at DWCC by \nmental health professionals, combined with the gross systemic deficiencies previously \ndiscussed, rises to the level of a constitutional violation.   \n123 \n   \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 641   Filed 11/01/22   Page 124 of 165 PageID #: \n35350\n3.  Conclusion as to the Delivery of Mental Health Services \nIt  cannot  be  genuinely  disputed  that  there  is  a  serious  need  for  mental  health \nservices for inmates on the South Compound at DWCC. As detailed above, inmates with \nmental  illness  comprise  a  substantial  portion  of  the  inmates  on  extended  lockdown. \nDWCC, however, fails to provide those inmates with constitutionally adequate mental \nhealth services.  This failure is systemic. \nThe  Court  identified  six  areas  in  the  delivery  of  mental  health  services  that \ncontribute to the systemic failure to provide adequate mental health services to inmates \nclearly in need of such services: 1) the failure to properly screen and evaluate inmates for \nmental illness; 2) the failure to provide treatment beyond medication management; 3) the \nfailure to provide adequately trained mental health professionals in sufficient numbers; 4) \nthe failure to have safeguards around the administration of psychotropic medication; 5) the \nfailure to maintain accurate, complete, and confidential records; and 6) the failure to have \nan adequate suicide prevention program.  \nFor the reasons stated previously, the Court finds that a constitutional violation has \nbeen demonstrated, the two-pronged Eighth Amendment violation having been satisfied. \nAccordingly, Plaintiffs are entitled to further relief. \nE.  Conclusion  \nThe Court concludes this section by noting that it has great respect for the people \nwho have dedicated their lives to the carceral field. It appreciates Secretary LeBlanc for \ncandidly expressing his vision to move Louisiana away from its current restrictive housing \npractices to reflect the national norm. LeBlanc Trial Tr. vol. XVIII at 4436:17-4438:4 \n124 \n   \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 641   Filed 11/01/22   Page 125 of 165 PageID #: \n35351\n[Record  Document  at  562].  The  Court  also  acknowledges  that  the  DOC  voluntarily \npartnered with the Vera Institute to review its segregated housing practices. With that said, \nthe Court cannot “shrink” from its “obligation to enforce the constitutional rights of all \npersons,  including  prisoners.”  Brown  v.  Plata,  563  U.S.  493,  511  (2011)  (internal \nquotation marks and citation omitted). As it currently stands, DWCC is violating the \nEighth Amendment rights of its prisoners, many of whom suffer from mental illness, by \nhousing them in inhumane conditions on extended lockdown and by failing to deliver \nthose  inmates  adequate  mental  health  care.  Plaintiffs  are  entitled  to  further  relief  to \nalleviate the following violations:   \n(1) The current conditions of confinement on the South Compound, as detailed \nabove, have the mutually enforcing effect of exposing inmates on the South \nCompound to a substantial risk of severe psychological pain and suffering and \ndepriving those inmates of their sanity in violation of the Eighth Amendment.  \n \n(2) DWCC’s systemic failure to deliver adequate mental health services to inmates \non  the  South  Compound,  as  detailed  above,  constitutes  cruel  and  unusual \npunishment.  \n \n(3) Separately from above, a subgroup of the Class, inmates with mental illness,75 \nhas  its  Eighth  Amendment  rights  violated  because  the  conditions  of \nconfinement  on restricted housing expose inmates with  mental illness  to  a \nsubstantial likelihood of even more psychological pain and suffering, including \nthe exacerbation of their already diagnosed mental illness.     \n \n75 The Class includes all inmates on extended lockdown, which includes inmates with \nmental illness.  \n125 \n   \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 641   Filed 11/01/22   Page 126 of 165 PageID #: \n35352\nV.  ADA and RA Claims  \nA.  Background  \nThe Court will now turn to Plaintiffs’ ADA and RA claims.76 As stated above, \nthere is a high incidence of mental illness among inmates housed on the South Compound. \nDr.  Burns  and  Dr.  Thompson  concurred  that  there  is  a  forty  to  forty-five  percent \nprevalence rate for mental illness for inmates in segregation at DWCC. Burns Trial Tr. \nvol. V  at 1427:23-1428:1 [Record Document 539]; Thompson Trial Tr.  vol. XVII  at \n4070:13-17 [Record Document 561]. Dr. Thompson opined that this reflected “a high \nlevel of mental illness throughout the facility.” Thompson Trial Tr. vol. XVII at 4028:1-22 \n[Record Document 561]. By definition, LOC-3s and -4s have a mental illness, and LOC-\n3s have a serious mental illness.  \nDespite the high rate of mental illness throughout DWCC, the evidence shows that \nDWCC fails in its affirmative duty to identify inmates with mental illness and fails to \nprovide any accommodations or modifications to existing policies or practices for inmates \nwith mental illness on the South Compound. Additionally, the evidence shows that the \nDOC  and  DWCC  employ  unlawful  methods  of  administration  by  under-identifying \ninmates with serious mental illness and maintaining an inadequate process for inmates \nwith mental illness to request reasonable accommodations. As will be shown below, this \nresults  in  inmates  with  mental  illness  being  excluded  from  services,  benefits,  and \nactivities, such as group programming and individual counseling, in violation of the ADA \nand RA.    \n \n76 The Court adopts the factual findings from above and incorporates the facts throughout. \n126 \n   \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 641   Filed 11/01/22   Page 127 of 165 PageID #: \n35353\nB.  ADA and RA Standard  \nThe ADA provides that “no qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of \nsuch disability, be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services, \nprograms, or activities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any such \nentity.” 42 U.S.C. § 12132. It defines a person with a disability as one who has “a physical \nor mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities.” 42 U.S.C. \n§ 12102(1)(A); 28 C.F.R. § 36.105. This includes individuals with historical, but not \npresent, impairments and those who are regarded as having an impairment regardless of \nactual  disability.  42  U.S.C.  §  12102(1)(B)-(C).  The  RA  states  that  “[n]o  otherwise \nqualified individual with a disability . . . shall solely by reason of his disability . . . be \nsubjected  to  discrimination  under  any  program  or  activity  receiving  Federal  financial \nassistance.” 29 U.S.C. § 794(a). It defines disability in the same way as the ADA. Kemp v. \nHolder, 610 F.3d 231, 234 (5th Cir. 2010). “The RA and the ADA are judged under the \nsame legal standards, and the same remedies are available under both Acts.” Id. (citations \nomitted).  \nTo prevail on an ADA claim, a plaintiff must prove “(1) that he has a qualifying \ndisability; (2) that he is being denied the benefits of services, programs, or activities for \nwhich the public entity is responsible, or is otherwise discriminated against by the public \nentity; and (3) that such discrimination is by reason of his disability.” Hale v. King, 642 \nF.3d 492, 499 (5th Cir. 2011). The elements of a claim under the RA are the same, except \n127 \n   \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 641   Filed 11/01/22   Page 128 of 165 PageID #: \n35354\nthat the public entity in question must be one which receives federal financial assistance.77 \nSee Kemp, 610 F.3d at 234. Plaintiffs have established, and Defendants do not dispute, \nthat the ADA and RA apply to DWCC.  \nA defendant’s failure to make reasonable modifications for the unique needs of \ndisabled inmates can qualify as intentional discrimination. See, e.g., Melton v. Dall. Area \nRapid Transit, 391 F.3d 669, 672 (5th Cir. 2004); Garrett, 560 F. App’x at 382. Mental \nhealth  services  have  been  recognized  as  “services”  that  “benefit”  prisoners.  See \nPennsylvania  Dep’t  of  Corr.  v.  Yeskey,  524  U.S.  206,  210  (1998)  (“Modern  prisons \nprovide inmates with many recreational ‘activities,’ medical ‘services,’ and educational \nand vocational ‘programs,’ all of which at least theoretically ‘benefit’ the prisoners (and \nany of which disabled prisoners could be ‘excluded from participation in’).”); Hernandez \nv. Cnty. of Monterey, 110 F. Supp. 3d 929, 935-36 (N.D. Cal. 2015) (listing mental health \nservices). \n1.  Qualified Individuals  \nIt  cannot  be  genuinely  disputed  that  members  of  the  Subclass  are  qualified \nindividuals with disabilities that substantially limit one or more major life activities, as \ndefined  by  the  ADA.  For  one  thing,  Plaintiffs  successfully  certified  the  Subclass  by \nsubmitting evidence that some of the Named Plaintiffs had a mental illness and showed \nhow these diagnoses interfered with major life activities. In addition, Plaintiffs presented \nevidence that inmates housed in extended lockdown at DWCC have disabilities due to \nmental illness that interfere with major life activities, such as brain function. Take Bruce \n \n77 The RA has certain exceptions that are not applicable to the present case.  \n128 \n   \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 641   Filed 11/01/22   Page 129 of 165 PageID #: \n35355\nCharles for example; he was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. See Ex. D-63 at 119 [Record \nDocument 565-24]. Bipolar disorder is a qualifying disability even if symptoms are in \nremission, i.e., not active, and it limits a major life activity—brain function. 42 U.S.C. § \n12102; 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(j); Weed v. Sidewinder Drilling, Inc., 245 F. Supp. 3d 826, 834 \n(S.D. Tex. 2017). Charles’s case is representative of the Subclass. See, e.g., Turner Trial \nTr. vol. I at 83:11-20 [Record Document 533]; Ex. P-O-30 [Record Document 564-70]. \nIndeed, Defendants’ expert, Dr. Thompson, agreed with Dr. Burns that about forty percent \nof the inmates housed in extended lockdown had a mental illness. Thompson Trial Tr. vol. \nXVII at 4070:13-17 [Record Document 561]. And, by the very nature of the  mental \nillnesses, brain function is limited.  \nAccordingly, Plaintiffs have satisfied the first element of their claim by presenting \nevidence that the Subclass consists of qualified individuals under the ADA and RA; thus, \nthe Court must determine whether Plaintiffs proved that “members of the Subclass are \nbeing  excluded  from  participation  in,  or  being  denied  the  benefits  of  some  service, \nprogram, or activity by reason of their disabilities.” Lewis, 2021 WL 1219988, at *44. \n“Plaintiffs’  burden  is  to  demonstrate  a  systemic  failure;  they  are  not  required  to \ndemonstrate a failure of policies applied to each class member individually.” Id.  \nPlaintiffs’  claims  under  the  ADA  and  RA  can  be  grouped  into  two  broad \ncategories. Plaintiffs contend that DWCC violates the ADA and  RA 1)  by failing to \naccommodate inmates with mental illness and 2) by employing methods of administration \nthat  discriminate  against  inmates  with  mental  illness.  The  Court  will  address  each \ncategory in turn. \n129 \n   \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 641   Filed 11/01/22   Page 130 of 165 PageID #: \n35356\n2.  Failure to Accommodate \nPlaintiffs argue that DWCC fails in its affirmative duty to accommodate inmates \nwith known disabilities. “In addition to their respective prohibitions of disability-based \ndiscrimination, both the ADA and the [RA] impose upon public entities an affirmative \nobligation to make reasonable accommodations for disabled individuals.” Cadena v. El \nPaso Cnty., 946 F.3d 717, 723 (5th Cir. 2020) (citations omitted); Smith v. Harris Cnty., \n956  F.3d  311,  317  (5th  Cir.  2020)  (internal  quotations  marks  and  citations  omitted). \nAlthough the ADA “does not require prisons to provide new services or programs for \ndisabled  prisoners,”  prisons  “do  have  an  affirmative  obligation  to  make  reasonable \nmodifications . . . so that a disabled prisoner can have meaningful access to existing public \nservices or programs.” Borum v. Swisher Cnty., No. 2:14-CV-127-J, 2015 WL 327508, at \n*9 (N.D. Tex. Jan. 26, 2015). \nPlaintiffs assert three specific claims: 1) where DWCC identifies an inmate with a \nmental illness, DWCC does not make any reasonable modifications or accommodations \nfor  that  inmate;  2)  DWCC  fails  to  make  any  reasonable  accommodations  to  the \ndisciplinary or use of force practices as they are applied to inmates with mental illness; \nand 3) DWCC disregards recommendations from its own mental health staff that inmates \nwith  a  serious  mental  illness  be  placed  in  general  population  instead  of  extended \nlockdown. The Court will address each specific claim in turn. \n(a)  Affirmative Modifications  \nThe evidence shows that inmates with mental illness at DWCC are subjected to the \nsame conditions as all other inmates on the South Compound without any individualized \n130 \n   \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 641   Filed 11/01/22   Page 131 of 165 PageID #: \n35357\nassessment by a qualified person as to the appropriateness of housing those individuals in \nsuch  harsh  conditions.  See  Dauzat  Trial  Tr.  vol.  III  at  750:20-751:3,  757:21-759:12  \n[Record Document 536] (stating that mental health plays no role in the classification of \ninmates with mental illness); Seal Trial Tr. vol. V at 1223:18-1227:11 [Record Document \n539] (establishing that DWCC does not utilize Dr. Seal, the only psychiatrist at DWCC, to \nundertake  any  inquiry  into  whether  his  patients  can  be  safely  housed  in  extended \nlockdown and that Dr. Seal is unfamiliar with the conditions of confinement on the South \nCompound). As detailed above, DWCC plainly fails to individually assess inmates with \nmental illness. Instead, all inmates receive the same treatment plan with three generic \ngoals listed.  \nDefendants also do not make any alterations to the conditions of confinement that \nprohibit individual participation in group therapy and all other out-of-cell programming; \nthat deprive prisoners of their property, access to a common eating area, the recreation \nyard,  the  gymnasium,  and  contact  visitation;  and  that  result  in  social  isolation  and \nenforced idleness for twenty-three to twenty-four hours per day. Defendants concede that \ninmates with mental illness do not receive accommodations on the South Compound even \nwhen  accommodations  are  requested  by  inmates  that  DWCC  knows  to  have  serious \nmental illnesses. See Huff Trial Tr. vol. IX at 2067:21-2071:3, 2106:21-2107:6 [Record \nDocument 543]; Ex. P-E-133 at 1, 28-29 [Record Document 564-26].  \nAs Drs. Haney and Burns credibly established, as stated above, extended lockdown \nposes a substantial risk to the mental health of inmates; even more so for inmates with \nmental illness whose symptoms often worsen while on extended lockdown, which then \n131 \n   \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 641   Filed 11/01/22   Page 132 of 165 PageID #: \n35358\nleads to worse behavior. And so, inmates with mental illness often are unable to conform \ntheir behavior to meet the requirements to return to general population and thus serve a \nprolonged stay on extended lockdown and, if eventually released, return cyclically when \ntheir symptoms reappear.78 See Burns Trial Tr. vol.

Inmates with mental illness thus are \noften excluded from the services, programs, and activities available to inmates in general \npopulation, such as group therapy and other out-of-cell programming, though inmates \nwith  mental  illness  are  often  the  ones  most  in  need  of  such  services,  activities,  and \nprograms. Even if some inmates’ active mental illness prohibits them from being safely \nintegrated into general population, DWCC’s policies and practices of failing to treat those \ninmates in a way that accommodates their mental illness have the effect of excluding those \ninmates from many services, activities, and programs.  \nIn the Court’s view, this violates the ADA and RA. 28 C.F.R. § 35.152(b)(2) \n(“Public entities shall ensure that inmates or detainees with disabilities are housed in the \n \n78 As stated above, inmates with mental illness represent about forty to forty-five percent \nof the inmates on extended lockdown at DWCC.

L.C.  ex  rel.  Zimring,  527  U.S.  581,  587,  597  (1999)  (holding  that  the \nunjustified isolation of a disabled individual constitutes discrimination).  \n  Defendants counter that Plaintiffs’ claims must fail because they have not produced \nevidence that inmates are being discriminated against because of their disabilities. In other \nwords, the fact that DWCC treats all inmates on extended lockdown the same regardless \nof  mental  illness,  Defendants  contend,  defeats  any  ADA  and  RA  claim.  The  Court \ndisagrees.  \nIt  is  DWCC’s  failure  to  individually  consider  each  inmate’s  mental  illness  or \naccommodation needs before placing inmates in extended lockdown for twenty-three to \ntwenty-four hours per day for months and, sometimes, years at a time and then DWCC’s \nfailure to provide any modifications to alleviate the severe harm extended isolation poses \nto  those  inmates  that  is  discriminatory.  In  fact,  the  “failure  to  make  reasonable \naccommodations to the needs of a disabled prisoner may have the effect of discriminating \nagainst  that  prisoner  because  the  lack  of  an  accommodation  may  cause  the  disabled \nprisoner to suffer more pain and punishment than non-disabled prisoners.” McCoy v. Tex. \nDep’t of Crim. Justice, No. C-05-370, 2006 WL 2331055, at *7 (S.D. Tex. Aug. 9, 2006). \n“[A] person with a disability may be the victim of discrimination precisely because she \n133 \n   \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 641   Filed 11/01/22   Page 134 of 165 PageID #: \n35360\ndid not receive disparate treatment when she needed accommodation.” Presta v. Peninsula \nCorridor Joint Powers Bd., 16 F. Supp. 2d 1134, 1136 (N.D.

Louisiana Dep’t of Wildlife & Fisheries, 439 F. Supp. 3d \n801, 808 (E.D. La. 2020) (quoting McGary v. City of Portland, 386 F.3d 1259, 1267 (9th \nCir. 2004)). United States Supreme Court Justice Jackson, while a district court judge, \nstated: \n[P]rison  officials  have  an  affirmative  duty  to  assess  the  potential \naccommodation needs of inmates with known disabilities who are taken \ninto custody and to provide the accommodations that are necessary for \nthose inmates to access the prison’s programs and services, without regard \nto whether or not the disabled individual has made a specific request for \naccommodation and without relying solely on the assumptions of prison \nofficials regarding that individual’s needs. \n \nPierce v. District of Columbia, 128 F. Supp. 3d 250, 272 (D.D.C. 2015). So too with the \ndecision to exclude inmates from various services, activities, and programs by placing \ninmates on extended lockdown—whether prison officials do so as an initial classification \ndecision  or  for  disciplinary  reasons.  On  that  basis,  Defendants  plainly  fail,  which \npotentially exposes individuals with mental illness to greater harm and suffering. DWCC’s \nfailure to treat inmates with mental illness in a way that accommodates the mental illness \nviolates the ADA and RA.    \n(b)  Discipline  \nPlaintiffs maintain that DWCC violates the ADA and RA by failing to consider an \ninmate’s mental illness before using force or imposing discipline against inmates who \n134 \n   \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 641   Filed 11/01/22   Page 135 of 165 PageID #: \n35361\npose  no  immediate  threat  to  safety.  Although  the  maintenance  of  prison  security  is \ntypically left to the sound discretion of prison staff, as stated above, prison officials have \nan affirmative obligation to examine the needs of inmates with mental illness and provide \nthem with necessary accommodations to ensure access to prison services. See Pierce, 128 \nF.  Supp.  3d  at  271-72.  Other  courts  have  held  that  the  “obligation  to  provide \naccommodations applies to the discipline of disabled inmates, as well.” Lewis, 2021 WL \n1219988, at *55 (citation omitted). In the prison context, the ADA and RA are violated \n“where  a  correctional  officer  could  have  used  less  force  or  no  force  during  the \nperformance of his or her penological duties with respect to a disabled person.” Id. at *56 \n(quoting Armstrong v. Newsom, No. 94-CV-02307 CW, 2021 WL 933106, at *25 (N.D. \nCal. Mar. 11, 2021)). A “lack of medical oversight in disciplinary decisions for disabled \ninmates” could support a failure-to-accommodate claim under the ADA and RA. Id. \nHere, the evidence shows a concerning disconnect between security and the mental \nhealth  department.  See  Nail  Trial  Tr.  vol.  VIII  1823:7-24  [Record  Document  542] \n(testifying that he did not actually know whether DWCC housed inmates with mental \nillness on the South Compound and that he never met with Deputy Warden Dauzat about \nindividual  prisoners);  Coleman  Trial  Tr.  vol.  VII  at  1632:21-25,  1649:20  [Record \nDocument 541] (consistently testifying that mental health related things are not part of his \n“job  duties”  as  a  security  officer).  Security  deploys  force  and  discipline  without \nconsidering an inmate’s mental illness. See, e.g., Coleman Trial Tr. vol. VII at 1631:23 \n[Record Document 541] (testifying that he never consulted the mental health department \nbefore imposing strip cell status). DWCC has in place a policy that mental health must be \n135 \n   \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 641   Filed 11/01/22   Page 136 of 165 PageID #: \n35362\ncalled before chemical agents can be used on an inmate “on the mental health list . . . if \ntime warrants it and it doesn’t put any of the other inmates or staff at risk.” See Nail Trial \nTr. vol. VIII at 1784:19-1785:1 [Record Document 542].79 But this limitation on when \nmental health staff must be called is interpreted by the staff to include instances in which \nan inmate is making too much noise, kicking a cell door, or slamming the footlocker box. \nId. at 1785:2-14. What is more is that security will deploy mace on inmates in restraints on \nsuicide watch for acts of self-harm before attempting de-escalating tactics or contacting \nthe mental health department. See id. at 1923:4-1924:17 (describing the use of chemical \nspray against an inmate in full restraints on extreme suicide for hitting his head and body \nagainst the cell door).  \nThe mental health department plays no role in the decision to place inmates with \nmental illness in  segregation, and the mental health  staff is not  consulted  before  the \nimplementation of sanctions or greater discipline, such as strip cell status, yard restriction, \netc. See, e.g., Dauzat Trial Tr. vol. III at 750:20-751:3 [Record Document 536] (stating \nthat the mental health department plays no actual role in the placement of inmates on \nextended  lockdown);  Mays  Trial  Tr.  vol.  IX  at  2158:8-17  [Record  Document  543] \n(testifying that the mental health department was not consulted regarding classification); \nHayden Trial Tr. vol. II at 387:4-13 [Record Document 534] (stating that he is unfamiliar \nwith strip cell status).  \n \n79 The Court reiterates that DWCC does not make a list of inmates on the mental health \ncaseload available to security officers. Colonel Nail testified that he relied on the heat \npathology list and that he could “surmise” which inmates were on the mental health \ncaseload “by face” based on “who’d come and see the mental health people.” Nail Trial \nTr. vol. VIII at 1820:8-1821:14 [Record Document 542]. \n136 \n   \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 641   Filed 11/01/22   Page 137 of 165 PageID #: \n35363\nThe bottom line is this: based on the evidence, the Court finds that the mental \nhealth staff employs “a completely ‘hands off’ approach to discipline” as it relates to the \ndiscipline of inmates with mental illness. Lewis, 2021 WL 1219988, at *56. This violates \nthe ADA and RA because inmates with mental illness run the risk of being disciplined in \nthe same way as inmates without mental illness even though the discipline could expose \ninmates with mental illness to greater harm. See McCoy, 2006 WL 2331055, at *7.  \n(c)  Housing \n \n   The Court finds that the evidence, as presented at trial, does not support an ADA or \nRA  claim  regarding  security  officials  disregarding  recommendations  from  the  mental \nhealth staff that inmates with mental illness be placed in general population instead of \nextended lockdown. Although Plaintiffs showed several instances of Hayden checking the \ngeneral population box on the recommended housing section of the intake screening form, \nthis is just a preliminary observation at the time inmates arrive at DWCC. Most of the \ntime, Hayden makes this observation without the benefit of the inmates’ records. Hayden \nTrial Tr. vol. II at 385:7-386:5 [Record Document 534]. The Court does not view this as \nan official recommendation from the mental health staff. The salient point is that the \nmental health department plays no actual role in the housing decision for inmates with \nmental  illness.  Dauzat  Trial  Tr.  vol.  III  at  750:20-751:3,  757:21-759:12  [Record \nDocument 536]. \n3.  Methods of Administration  \nPlaintiffs  assert  that  Defendants  violate  the  ADA  by  utilizing  methods  of \nadministration that have the effect of discriminating against disabled inmates. Particularly \n137 \n   \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 641   Filed 11/01/22   Page 138 of 165 PageID #: \n35364\nrelevant to this case, the ADA also recognizes a “methods of administration” claim that \nprohibits public entities from using “criteria or methods of administration . . . [that] have \nthe effect of subjecting qualified individuals with disabilities to discrimination on the basis \nof disability.” 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(3); see Dunn v. Dunn, 318 F.R.D. 652, 664 (M.D. \nAla. 2016). \nA public entity may not . . . utilize criteria or methods of administration . . . \n[t]hat have the effect of subjecting qualified individuals with disabilities to \ndiscrimination on the basis of disability . . . [or] [t]hat have the purpose or \neffect  of  defeating  or  substantially  impairing  accomplishment  of  the \nobjectives of the public entity’s program with respect to individuals with \ndisabilities. \n28  C.F.R.  §  35.130(b)(3)(i)  &  (ii).  “In  other  words,  a  public  entity  cannot  actively \nundercut the ability of a public program to benefit those with disabilities.” Van Velzor v. \nCity of Burleson, 43 F. Supp. 3d 746, 752 (N.D. Tex. 2014). “[A]n omission as well as a \ncommission can be an actionable method of administration.” Dunn, 318 F.R.D. at 665. \n“The methods-of-administration regulation makes clear that a know-nothing, do-nothing \npolicy of non-administration is a privately actionable violation of the ADA, at least when \nplaintiffs can show that it has the effect of discriminating.” Id. at 665 n.12. Under the \nADA, prisons must be “proactive.” Id.  \nWith  respect  to  the  methods  of  administration,  Plaintiffs  allege  three  specific \nviolations: 1) that DWCC fails to individually identify inmates with disabilities; 2) that \nDWCC excludes individuals with chronic mental illness from the definition of serious \nmental illness; and 3) that DWCC has an inadequate system for processing requests for \nreasonable accommodations and fails to track such requests. \n138 \n   \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 641   Filed 11/01/22   Page 139 of 165 PageID #: \n35365\n(a)  Whether the DOC’s definition of serious mental illness is \nunder-inclusive \n \nPlaintiffs  claim  that  the  DOC’s  definition  of  serious  mental  illness  is  under-\ninclusive and fails to identify and track prisoners with serious mental illness by way of \nfunctional impairment. An unlawful method of administration can occur when a public \nentity  “employ[s]  no  system  or  an  inadequate  system  for  identifying  and  tracking \nprisoners with disabilities.” Id. at 665.  \nThe DOC tracks inmates with mental illness based only on its internal level of care \nsystem and an internal definition of  serious mental illness, which is based  solely on \ndiagnosis rather than functional impairment. Ex. P-JJJ-25 [Record Document 564-204]. \nAs previously mentioned, the DOC’s definition of serious mental illness only includes six \nenumerated conditions: major depressive disorder, schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, \nbipolar disorder, unspecified schizophrenia spectrum, and severe anxiety disorder. Id. at 2. \nBy limiting the definition of serious mental illness to only a list of six specific diagnoses \nand  failing  to  independently  track  disability,  Defendants  under-identify  inmates  with \ndisabilities by excluding those with mental illness whose symptoms cause a functional \nimpairment but whose diagnosis is not included on the limited list of six serious mental \nillness diagnoses. Burns Trial Tr. vol. V at 1271:22-1273:13 [Record Document 539]. \nThis  is  something  on  which  both  Plaintiffs  and  Defendants  agree.  See  id.;  see  also \nThompson Trial Tr. vol. XVII at 4112:9-4113:25 [Record Document 561].  \nDr. Burns testified that diagnoses other than the six enumerated diagnoses can \nreach the level of a disability based on functional impairment.  The American Correctional \n139 \n   \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 641   Filed 11/01/22   Page 140 of 165 PageID #: \n35366\nAssociation recognizes and requires prisons to track both disabilities from the enumerated \ndiagnoses and those arising from a functional impairment. Dr. Burns attested that a serious \nmental illness by way of functional impairment is a mental illness that disrupts a person’s \nability to interact with others; it is considered serious based on the degree of impaired \nfunctioning it causes. Burns Trial Tr. vol. V at 1271:22-1273:13 [Record Document 539].    \nDr. Thompson concurred with Dr. Burns. He testified that people could have a \ndisability from a mental health diagnosis other than the six enumerated by the DOC’s \ndefinition of serious mental illness. The functional impairment arising from the person’s \nmental health condition is the determining factor in whether the person has a serious \nmental illness by way of functional impairment. Thompson Trial Tr. vol. XVII at 4113:2-\n25  [Record  Document  561].  Dr.  Thompson  further  testified  that,  periodically,  some \ninmates at DWCC appear to have levels of functioning that would put them at a higher \nlevel of need than LOC-3. Id. at 4002:21-24  \nInmates with serious mental illness need access to a psychiatrist and counselors \nwhen they arrive at a new facility. Burns Trial Tr. vol. V at 1291:25-1292:8 [Record \nDocument 539]. Dr. Seal, the person best equipped to gauge the impact of a mental health \ncondition on a person’s level of function, is wholly uninvolved in assigning the serious \nmental  illness  designation  used  by  the  DOC  to  track  inmates  with  mental  health \ndisabilities. Seal Trial Tr. vol. V at 1229:13-18 [Record Document 539]. DWCC does not \nutilize Dr. Seal, the only psychiatrist it employs, to inquire into whether patients can be \nsafely  housed  in  extended  lockdown.  Seal  Trial  Tr.  vol.  V  at  1223:18-22  [Record \nDocument 539]. Even people with severe disorders such as psychosis and schizophrenia, \n140 \n   \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 641   Filed 11/01/22   Page 141 of 165 PageID #: \n35367\nwho arrive at DWCC already flagged by the DOC as seriously mentally ill, receive the \nexact same plan of “follow-up per policy” as any other new arrival, despite being more in \nneed of immediate attention. Burns Trial Tr. vol. V at 1291:23-1292:8, 1295:3-21 [Record \nDocument 539].  \nHere, the evidence showed that the DOC uses an under-inclusive definition of \ndisability by excluding inmates with debilitating mental illnesses by way of functional \nimpairment from the definition of serious mental illness. This method of administration \nresults in a substantial likelihood that inmates with serious mental illnesses by way of \nfunctional impairment will fall through the cracks and will not be treated accordingly. \nThis poses a substantial likelihood that those inmates will not be tracked and provided the \nappropriate  level  of  mental  health  care  or  offered  the  appropriate  affirmative \naccommodations. And it makes it even more likely that those inmates will be disciplined \nwithout consideration for their unidentified serious mental illness. Defendants have thus \nviolated the ADA in this regard.  \n(b)  Whether DWCC excludes people with chronic mental illness \nfrom the definition of serious mental illness  \n \nNext, Plaintiffs aver that even DWCC inmates with a diagnosed serious mental \nillness based on the under-inclusive definition lose their serious mental designation if they \nare in a period of remission. Plaintiffs argue that this policy violates the ADA because \n“[t]he determination of whether an impairment substantially limits a major life activity \n[must] be made without regard to the ameliorative effects of mitigating measures such as \nmedication.” 42 U.S.C. § 12102(4)(E)(i)(I); Kemp, 610 F.3d at 236. In support, Plaintiffs \n141 \n   \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 641   Filed 11/01/22   Page 142 of 165 PageID #: \n35368\ncite to the example of Bruce Charles, an inmate diagnosed with bipolar disorder, who lost \nhis serious mental illness designation because he was in a period of remission. Ex. D-63 at \n119 [Record Document 564-24]. This one incident, however, does not show a systemic \ndeficiency in this regard. Although Charles’s ADA rights may have been violated in this \none  instance,  Plaintiffs  have  failed  to  prove  a  widespread  failure  in  identifying  and \ntracking inmates with a serious mental illness in remission. Accordingly, Plaintiffs have \nfailed to prove that DWCC systemically excludes inmates with chronic mental illness \nfrom the under-inclusive definition of serious mental illness.80  \n(c)  Whether Defendants provide an adequate process for \nrequesting reasonable accommodations  \n \nPlaintiffs contend that DWCC’s failure to process and track requests for reasonable \naccommodations related to mental illness is part of DWCC’s systemic failure to comply \nwith the ADA.  Under the ADA,  “employing no system or an inadequate  system for \nprisoners  to  request  accommodations  and  submit  grievances  regarding  non-\naccommodation” can be an unlawful method of administration. Dunn, 318 F.R.D. at 665; \nsee Lewis, 2021 WL 1219988, at *48-50, 52; Armstrong v. Brown, 857 F. Supp. 2d 919, \n933 (N.D. Cal. 2012) (finding a violation of the ADA because the county jail lacked \n“functional  and  timely  grievance  procedures  .  .  .  to  request  and  obtain  disability \naccommodations”).  \nPrior to March 2020, Deputy Warden Huff, who has a background in accounting, \nwas the ADA liaison at DWCC. Record Document 524 ¶ 137. As ADA coordinator, \n \n80 Nevertheless, this evidence is probative of the overall failure of DWCC to comply with \nthe ADA when the evidence is viewed in totality. \n142 \n   \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 641   Filed 11/01/22   Page 143 of 165 PageID #: \n35369\nDeputy  Warden  Huff  was  responsible  for  handling  requests  for  reasonable \naccommodations. The majority of, if not all, accommodation requests come through the \nARP process, as directed by policy.81 Deputy Warden Huff testified that when an inmate \nrequests a reasonable accommodation, she is required to interview that  inmate; ADA \ninterviews have a specific form and should be documented in the ARP file itself. Huff \nTrial Tr. vol. IX at 1989:8-1990:10 [Record Document 543]; see also Ex. D-3 [Record \nDocument 565-3] (DOC ADA policy). These forms, however, are nonexistent in DWCC’s \nrecords.  \nAdditionally, for a request to be considered as a request for an accommodation, \nDeputy  Warden  Huff  required  inmates  to  title  requests  as  an  “ADA  complaint”  or \nspecifically write that they were making an accommodation request. Huff Trial Tr. vol. IX \nat 1990:3-8 [Record Document 543]. In her thirty-two years of employment at DWCC, \nfifteen  of  which  had  been  in  her  current  position,  Deputy  Warden  Huff  could  not \nremember granting a single request for reasonable accommodations based on a mental \nhealth disability. Id. at 1990:6-24. Deputy Warden Huff also could not recall a single \nrequest for accommodations based on mental illness in the past five years. Id. at 1990:19-\n21. Colonel Nail, the long-time Unit Manager of the South Compound, was unaware of \nthe process for a person to request a reasonable accommodation or if there even was a \nprocess.  \n \n81 Huff did testify that some ADA requests were handled informally before an inmate filed \na formal request. Huff Trial Tr. vol. IX at 2103:13-17 [Record Document 543]. \n143 \n   \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 641   Filed 11/01/22   Page 144 of 165 PageID #: \n35370\nDWCC’s current process leads to many ADA requests being ignored, unnoticed, \nand unaddressed. Take Corey Adams’s ADA request, for example. He filed it through the \nARP process, but nothing in DWCC’s response to Adams’s request for mental health \naccommodation indicates it was handled as a request for a reasonable accommodation. See \nId.  at  1270:15-21  [Record  Document  543].  There  was  no  evidence  that  Adams  was \ninterviewed by Deputy Warden Huff, nor was there any evidence in the ARP file that she \nfilled out an ADA-specific interview form. Furthermore, Adams’s ARP was backlogged \nand went unaddressed for almost three months.  \nThe trial evidence shows  that there are systemic deficiencies in the  ways  that \nDWCC identifies, screens, and tracks ADA requests. ADA requests have been subsumed \nby the ARP process. Deputy Warden Huff’s testimony demonstrated that she and her staff \nfail to recognize when mental health requests trigger the ADA.  \nBased on the evidence, DWCC is violating the Subclass’s ADA rights by failing to \nprovide inmates with “functional and timely grievance procedures . . . to request and \nobtain disability accommodations.” Brown, 857 F. Supp. 2d at 933. Regardless of what the \npolicy states, DWCC fails to appropriately process and track accommodation requests, \nwhich contributes to DWCC’s systemic failure to comply with the ADA. See Lewis, 2021 \nWL 1219988, at *52 (finding a systemic failure in Louisiana State Penitentiary’s tracking \nand processing of ADA accommodation requests).  \nC.  Conclusion  \nTo summarize, DWCC’s widespread neglect of mental illness results in violations \nof the ADA and RA. Plaintiffs have proven that there is a systemic failure to comply with \n144 \n   \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 641   Filed 11/01/22   Page 145 of 165 PageID #: \n35371\nthe ADA and RA. Specifically, Plaintiffs proved that DWCC fails to consider an inmate’s \nmental illness before placing him on extended lockdown for an indefinite period of time or \nbefore  deploying  discipline.  Further,  Defendants  provide  no  modifications  to  existing \npolicies or practices for the mentally ill on the South Compound, despite the mentally ill \nbeing susceptible to harm while on extended lockdown, which has the effect of excluding \nthem from various programs, activities, and services. Additionally, DWCC violates the \nADA by using an under-inclusive definition of serious mental illness and by failing to \nmaintain  an  adequate  system  for  inmates  to  request  and  obtain  reasonable \naccommodations regarding mental illness. Plaintiffs are entitled to further relief to cure \nthe deficiencies.        \nVI.  First Amendment Claims  \nA.  Background \nPlaintiffs  allege  that  Defendants  have  obstructed  counsel’s  investigation  of  the \nconditions at DWCC by systematically interfering with prisoner legal mail in violation of \nthe First Amendment. Particularly, Plaintiffs claim that prison officials violate inmates’ \nfree speech rights by opening and reading legal mail from inmates to attorneys and from \nattorneys  to  inmates  without  justification  and  outside  the  presence  of  the  inmates. \nAccording to Plaintiffs, the arbitrary monitoring of legal mail obviates the attorney-client \nprivilege  and  therefore  disrupts  counsel’s  ability  to  investigate  the  allegations  made \nagainst the prison and causes inmates to withdraw from litigation or limit their disclosures \nto counsel out of fear of retaliation at the hands of the staff against whom the inmates are \nlodging complaints.   \n145 \n   \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 641   Filed 11/01/22   Page 146 of 165 PageID #: \n35372\nDWCC is situated in a national forest in a remote part of Louisiana, and as such, \nmail correspondence serves as an important method of communication for inmates and \ntheir legal counsel. As of March 2020, DWCC employed two mailroom employees: Major \nAngela Mathews (“Major Mathews”) and Adrianne Judgeware (“Judgeware”). Mathews \nDep. at 10 [Record Document 564-265].82 Major Mathews testified via deposition in lieu \nof live testimony. She testified that she has been responsible for the DWCC mailroom \nsince approximately 2013 and supervises the only other mailroom employee, Judgeware. \nId. at 9:1-10:14. Together, the two are responsible for processing the mail, logging the \nlegal mail into a database, checking regular mail for contraband, placing the incoming \nmail in the night shift supervisor’s box for delivery to the inmates, picking up the outgoing \nmail from the repository in each building, and transporting the outgoing mail to the United \nStates Postal Service in Homer, Louisiana. Id. at 10:3-12:6, 35:15-37:24, 87:12-13. They \ndo not, however, open and inspect incoming and outgoing legal mail. Id. at 39:1-9.  \nB.  Legal Mail \nThe protections of the First Amendment continue to exist inside prison walls. See \nBrewer v. Wilkinson, 3 F.3d 816, 820-21 (5th Cir. 1993). An inmate’s right to be free from \nunlawful interference with his mail, including incoming and outgoing legal mail, arises \nfrom two distinct rights: the right of access to the courts and the right of free speech. See \nid. Plaintiffs, here, do not bring an access to the courts claim; rather, they contend that \nDWCC’s arbitrary interference with legal mail violates inmates’ “First Amendment right \n \n82 Major Mathews’s trial deposition in lieu of live testimony was accepted into the record \nas Ex. P-BBBB-3 [Record Document 564-265]. \n146 \n   \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 641   Filed 11/01/22   Page 147 of 165 PageID #: \n35373\nto free speech—i.e., the right to be free from unjustified governmental interference with \ncommunication.” Id. at 820.   \nInmates  retain  free  speech  rights  consistent  “with  the  legitimate  penological \nobjectives of the corrections system,” and restrictions on those rights cannot be greater \nthan necessary to protect the correctional interests involved. Id. The First Amendment thus \nprotects a prisoner from mail censorship that is not “reasonably related  to legitimate \npenological interests.” Id. at 824 (citation omitted). However, “freedom from censorship . \n. . is not the equivalent of freedom from inspection or perusal.” Wolff v. McDonnell, 418 \nU.S.  539,  576  (1974).  As  previously  mentioned,  Plaintiffs  allege  that  DWCC  has \ninterfered with both incoming and outgoing legal mail. Because the interference with \nincoming and outgoing legal mail presents different issues, the Court will address each \nclaim separately.   \n1.  Incoming Legal Mail  \n“[P]rison officials may open incoming legal mail to inspect it for contraband.” \nJones v. Mail Room Staff, 74 F. App’x 418, 419 (5th Cir. 2003) (citing Brewer, 3 F.3d at \n820-21). In the Fifth Circuit, “prisoners do not have a constitutional right to be present \nwhen privileged legal mail is opened and inspected.” Collins v. Foster, 602 F. App’x 273, \n275 (5th Cir. 2015) (citing Brewer, 3 F.3d at 825). Even “the violation of the prison \nregulation requiring that a prisoner be present when his incoming legal mail is opened and \ninspected is not a violation of a prisoner’s constitutional rights.” Brewer, 3 F.3d at 825. \nInstead, the inmate must show that his mail has been unlawfully censored or seized. See \n147 \n   \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 641   Filed 11/01/22   Page 148 of 165 PageID #: \n35374\nid. at 818-26, n.13 (requiring censorship to state a cognizable claim for a violation of \nopening legal mail).  \nWith  respect  to  incoming  legal  mail,  Major  Mathews  testified  that  once  an \nenvelope is identified as legal mail,83 the mail is logged into a computer database and \nplaced in the shift supervisor’s box for delivery to the inmate; the legal mail is not opened \nat this time. Mathews Dep. at 35:17-39:9 [Record Document 564-265]. Instead, an officer \nwith the rank of Captain or higher delivers the legal mail directly to the inmate and opens \nthe legal mail in front of the inmate to check for contraband. See id. at 39:1-9, 59:16-23; \naccord Ex. P-BBBB-4 at 30 [Record Document 564-266].  \nOn the contrary, inmates testified that, at times, incoming legal mail was opened \noutside their presence, which would be a violation of department policy. Carlton Turner, \nan inmate housed at DWCC during the relevant period, testified that an officer generally \n“opens the mail and hands it to [the inmate]” after the inmate signs a form, which is \nconsistent with Major Mathews’s testimony and DWCC policy. Turner Trial Tr. vol. I at \n70:7-11 [Record Document 533]. But, Turner stated, on one occasion he received an \nopened envelope from Disability Rights without any content inside. See id. at 78:11-19. \nAnother  DWCC  inmate,  Dameion  Brumfield,  testified  that  sometimes  he  had  “stuff” \nmissing from his legal mail at DWCC, so he knew someone went through it before he \nreceived the mail. Brumfield Trial Tr. vol. I at 168:9-169:2 [Record Document 533].  \n \n83 The mailroom staff can identify legal mail generally based on the sender being an \nidentifiable attorney or advocacy group. See Mathews Dep. at 35:1-14, 50:2-51:16, 106:7-\n107:15 [Record Document 564-265]. For example, Major Mathews was able to recite the \naddress of Disability Rights from memory. Id. at 50:20-51:3. Major Mathews also testified \nthat she could verify attorneys through the Bar Association. Id. at 35:4-14.  \n148 \n   \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 641   Filed 11/01/22   Page 149 of 165 PageID #: \n35375\nTurner’s and Brumfield’s non-specific testimony, however, was not persuasive to \nthe Court in this regard. Turner’s description of the alleged incident was vague and lacked \nsigns of reliability. For instance, there is no evidence that Turner filed an administrative \ngrievance  regarding  this  alleged  incident  so  that  this  incident  could  have  been \ninvestigated.  Additionally,  he  did  not  approximate  when  this  incident  took  place  or \nspecifically identify the security staff whom Turner claims he informally confronted about \nthe  missing  content  so  that  someone  could  testify  in  support  or  in  challenge  of  his \nallegations.84 See Turner Trial Tr. vol. I at 78:11-80:10 [Record Document 533]. In short, \nthe Court finds Turner’s description of the alleged incident to be too vague to carry \nenough indicia of reliability.   \nLikewise,  Brumfield  testified  in  generalities  and  did  not  detail  any  specific \ninstances of mail tampering, nor did he describe how he knew “stuff” was missing or what \n“stuff” was missing. See Brumfield Trial Tr. vol. I at 168:9-169:2 [Record Document \n533]. There is also no evidence that Brumfield filed a grievance regarding his incoming \nlegal  mail  being  opened  outside  of  his  presence  and  its  content  being  censored. \nBrumfield’s testimony was thus unreliable in this regard. Plaintiffs submitted no otherwise \n \n84 In response to the question about identifying who brought Turner the legal mail, he \ntestified, “Sometimes mostly it would be Captain Solomon, but it would never be the same \nperson. It was always different officers that brought the legal mail.” Turner Trial Tr. vol. I \nat 79:16-18 [Record Document 533]. In effect, Turner answered generally who brought \nhim mail but not specifically who brought him the empty envelope.  \n149 \n   \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 641   Filed 11/01/22   Page 150 of 165 PageID #: \n35376\ncredible evidence that proves the disputed fact that DWCC was censoring or interfering \nwith incoming legal mail.85  \nThe Court finds that the delivering officer opens and inspects incoming legal mail \nin front of the inmate. After inspecting the legal mail, the delivering officer requires the \nreceiving inmate to sign a legal mail receipt before relinquishing the legal mail to the \ninmate; the legal mail receipt signifies that the inmate received his mail.86 Mathews Dep. \nat 37-38, 61 [Record Document 564-265]. If the inmate does not sign the mail receipt, he \ndoes not receive the mail and the mail is returned to the sender. Id. at 61-62.  \nHere, Plaintiffs’ incoming legal mail claim fails for a lack of proof. There is no \ncredible  evidence  that  DWCC  has  opened  or  read  incoming  legal  mail  outside  the \npresence of the inmate. Even if so, the Fifth Circuit has made clear that such conduct \nalone does not violate constitutional rights even when prison regulations are violated. See \nBrewer, 3 F.3d at 825 (stating that the inspection of incoming legal mail is a legitimate \npenological practice). More germane, Plaintiffs failed to produce any credible evidence of \nwidespread censorship of incoming legal mail. As such, Plaintiffs have failed to prove a \nconstitutional violation as to their incoming legal mail claim.  \n \n85 Other inmates filed grievances regarding the censoring of incoming legal mail. These \ngrievances, however, were not admitted for the truth of the matter asserted but, instead, to \nshow notice of a potential issue and a duty to investigate. Although Defendants were on \nnotice of complaints about mail tampering, Plaintiffs have failed to prove the truth of any \nof the complaints. \n86 Plaintiffs also contend that the form acknowledges that the envelope was sealed when \nreceived by the inmate. Plaintiffs, however, did not submit an example of a physical \nreceipt into evidence to support this contention. Instead, the Court finds the testimony of \nMajor Mathews credible in this regard as she testified consistent with the policy that the \nsignature signals that the inmate received his mail. See Ex. P-BBBB-4 at 30 [Record \nDocument 564-266]. \n150 \n   \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 641   Filed 11/01/22   Page 151 of 165 PageID #: \n35377\n2.  Outgoing Legal Mail  \nPlaintiffs’ outgoing legal mail claim presents a different issue. “[A] distinction still \nexists between incoming prison mail and outgoing prison mail.” Id. (citing Thornburgh v. \nAbbott, 490 U.S. 401, 413 (1989)). “But that distinction revolves around the differing \npenological concerns with respect to outgoing and incoming mail.” Id. “The implications \nof outgoing correspondence for prison security are of a categorically lesser magnitude \nthan the implications of incoming materials.” Thornburgh, 490 U.S. at 413. The Fifth \nCircuit has recognized that inmates have a right to be free from “arbitrary censorship” of \noutgoing mail. Brewer, 3 F.3d at 826.  \nInmates are allowed flex pens, paper, envelopes, and stamps to send mail, including \nlegal  mail.  Moran  Trial  Tr.  vol.  I  at  210:17-211:25  [Record  Document  533].  When \nsending legal mail, each inmate typically seals his own envelope. See id. at 211:13-14; \nTurner Trial Tr. vol. I at 71:7-11 [Record Document 533]; Brumfield Trial Tr. vol. I at \n164:6-165:25  [Record  Document  533];  Dillon  Trial  Tr.  vol.  I  at  272:10-11  [Record \nDocument 533]; Mathews Dep. at 46:16-19 [Record Document 564-265]. Per DOC and \nDWCC  policy,  legal  mail  should  not  be  opened  and  inspected  without  express \nauthorization from the Warden or Deputy Warden. Dep. Reg. No. C-02-009 section I; Ex. \nP-BBBB-4 [Record Document 564-266]. In contrast, regular mail is sent to the mailroom \nunsealed and the staff seals the envelope with tape after inspection. Mathews Dep. at \n46:20-24 [Record Document 564-265]. If legal mail arrives to the mailroom unsealed, \nMajor Mathews testified that the mailroom staff would seal the envelope by applying tape. \nId. at 50:5-10.   \n151 \n   \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 641   Filed 11/01/22   Page 152 of 165 PageID #: \n35378\nAlong with addressing the envelope to legal counsel, inmates are required to write \n“legal mail” or “privileged correspondence” on the envelope to clearly identify the mail as \nlegal. Id. at 45:16-22. Because inmates on the South Compound do not have access to a \nmailbox, a prison official carries a locked mailbox down the tier for each  inmate to \npersonally place mail into. Id. at 47:20-48:13.87 At times, however, inmates hand their \nmail directly to prison staff walking on the tiers.88 Turner Trial Tr. vol. I at 69:21-70:6 \n[Record Document 533]; Brumfield Trial Tr. vol. I at 164:9-11 [Record Document 533]; \nMoran Trial Tr. vol. I at 210:17-211:18 [Record Document 533]. Only Major Mathews \nand Judgeware have keys to the mailboxes. Mathews Dep. at 56:7-12 [Record Document \n564-265]. After Major Mathews or Judgeware picks up the mail from the mailboxes, they \nwill take it back to the mailroom to sort it, inspect regular mail, stamp the mail with a \nstamp that says, “Not Responsible for Contents,” and then transport the outgoing mail to \nthe United States Post Office after which DWCC no longer has control over the mail. Id. \nat 46:20-24, 49:19-24, 87:7-22; see, e.g., Exs. P-C-023-024 [Record Document 564].89  \n  Plaintiffs do not challenge DWCC’s official mailroom policy. Instead, Plaintiffs \ncontend that Defendants violate those policies by opening and reading legal mail outside \n \n87 Major Mathews responded, “Mm-hmm,” when asked if the officers take the mailbox \ndown the tier and if the inmate puts the mail in the box. Although unambiguous responses \nare preferred, the context confirms that she was responding affirmatively to the questions.  \n88 Plaintiffs stopped short of conclusively establishing that the mailbox is never passed \ndown the tier. Instead, the testimony of the inmates, which the Court found credible in this \nregard, shows inmates also hand their mail directly to an officer walking down the tier in \nlieu of placing it in the mailbox.  \n89 Plaintiffs submitted Exhibits P-C as physical letters into evidence, which the Clerk of \nCourt will preserve and maintain for the Fifth Circuit. To maintain the integrity of the \nphysical letters, no party, attorney, or member of the public may view or handle these \nletters without express authorization and oversight from the Court.   \n152 \n   \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 641   Filed 11/01/22   Page 153 of 165 PageID #: \n35379\nthe presence of inmates. In support, Plaintiffs submitted the stipulated testimony of two \nmail  workers  at  Disability  Rights—Chelsea  Ormon  (“Ormon”)  and  Leah  O’Brien \n(“O’Brien”), the testimony of inmates, and 116 envelopes from inmates at DWCC to \nDisability Rights with tape applied to the envelopes. \n  Ormon and O’Brien both worked at Disability Rights and were, at different times \nduring  the  litigation,  the  staff  responsible  for  receiving  and  reviewing  written \ncorrespondence  from  inmates  at  various  DOC  facilities,  including  DWCC.  Record \nDocuments 615 ¶¶ 1-4, 615-1 ¶¶ 1-4. They both testified that they received hundreds of \nletters from inmates housed at DWCC. Record Documents 615 ¶¶ 15, 18. And Ormon \ntestified that five to ten percent of the envelopes received from DWCC had tape applied to \nthem. Record Document 615 ¶ 22. Both Ormon and O’Brien testified that they did not \nrecall ever receiving mail from other Louisiana correctional institutions with tape applied \nto  the  envelopes.  Record  Documents  615  ¶  21,  615-1  ¶  25.  Additionally,  they  both \ntestified that some of the envelopes Disability Rights received had been ripped open and \ntaped  closed  despite  the  correspondence  being  clearly  marked  as  legal  mail.  Record \nDocuments 615 ¶¶ 18-19, 615-1 ¶¶ 21-22. The Court, however, finds the testimony that \nthe envelopes were ripped open before arriving at Disability Rights largely overstated \nbased on the physical evidence.  \nOrmon was responsible for receiving and reviewing the written correspondence \nfrom inmates at DWCC from April 2016 to February 2019. Record Document 615 ¶ 2. \nShe  received  and  authenticated  the  envelopes  accepted  as  the  P-C  exhibit  [Record \nDocument 564]; in total, the P-C exhibit contained 104 envelopes. Record Document 615 \n153 \n   \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 641   Filed 11/01/22   Page 154 of 165 PageID #: \n35380\n¶ 26. These envelopes clearly have tape on them, which Ormon did not apply. Record \nDocument 615 ¶ 24. But many of the envelopes are only opened in one place.90 The Court \nis thus largely unable to decipher who made what cuts. In other words, because Ormon did \nnot cut open the envelopes in a unique way to preserve any alleged prior rips, the Court is \nunable to tell whether the adhesive was cut by Ormon based on her practice of opening the \nenvelopes with a letter opener or by somebody else. See, e.g, Exs. P-C-134/135, 136/137, \n138/139, 286/287 [Record Document 564]. And Ormon’s testimony was very broad, as \nshe testified that “some” of the envelopes were ripped open without pinpointing a specific \nletter as an exemplar and explaining how she was not the one who made the rips on the \nenvelope when opening the letter.91 What is more is that some of the envelopes are sealed \nshut notwithstanding the tape—that is, sealed by the envelope’s own adhesive, and the \nonly evidence of the envelopes being opened is where someone, presumably Ormon, cut \nthem open to retrieve the content.92 See, e.g., Exs. P-C-21/22, 142/143 [Record Document \n \n90 In fact, most of the envelopes are inconclusive because it is not clear to the Court who \nperformed the cut.  \n91  Ormon  photographed  many  of  the  envelopes  to  document  the  condition  in  which \nDisability Rights received them, Record Document 615 ¶ 20, but Plaintiffs failed to place \nthese photographs into evidence. As such, the Court must reach its conclusions from the \nphysical exhibits before it.  \n92 Plaintiffs have not presented evidence or alleged that DWCC was resealing envelopes \nby another means, such as by applying glue. Accordingly, the Court deems the following \nP-C exhibits as unopened except by Ormon to retrieve the content: 21/22, 27/28, 29/30, \n43/44/45,  70/71,  102/103,  116/117,  142/143,  152/153,  158/159,  172/173,  210/211, \n218/219,  220/221,  222/223,  230/231,  232/233,  236/237,  238/239,  244/245,  250/251, \n256/257, 264/265, 290/291, 294/295, 318/319, 322/323, 324/325, and 362/363 [Record \nDocument 564]. The only P-C exhibits that the Court found suspicious were P-C-23/24, \n208/209,  and  246/247;  the  remainder,  which  the  Court  counted  to  be  seventy-two \nenvelopes, are inconclusive because it is not clear to the Court who performed the cuts.   \n154 \n   \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 641   Filed 11/01/22   Page 155 of 165 PageID #: \n35381\n564]. Accordingly, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have failed in their burden of proving \nDWCC opened any P-C exhibit, except as discussed below.  \nOf the 104 envelopes the Court reviewed in the P-C exhibit, the Court did identify \nthree letters that DWCC opened: 23/24, 208/209, and 246/247 [Record Document 564]. \nThese envelopes appear cut open at the top by a machine—that is, a cleaner cut and not \nripped open—and then taped closed; they were not cut open along the adhesive. The Court \nfinds it inconceivable that someone would place tape at the top of the envelopes except for \nthe purpose of sealing an opened envelope. The Court also finds it implausible that the \nUnited States Postal Service would cut open these letters or that inmates on extended \nlockdown  would  have  access  to  a  letter  opener.  Further,  the  Court  finds  Ormon’s \ntestimony that she did not apply the tape to these envelopes to be credible. Accordingly, \nthe Court finds that Plaintiffs have proven that DWCC cut open these three pieces of legal \nmail with an opener, which constitutes three violations of department policy.      \n  Regarding O’Brien, most of the envelopes she reviewed while at Disability Rights \ndo  not convincingly establish that someone outside  her own organization opened the \nletters. O’Brien was responsible for receiving and reviewing mail from October 2019 to \nMarch 2020. Record Document 615-1 ¶¶ 2-3. As part of her testimony, she authenticated \ntwelve envelopes, which were accepted as exhibit P-B.93 Id. ¶ 26. These envelopes clearly \n \n93 Like exhibit P-C, Plaintiffs submitted the physical copies of the letters for exhibit P-B. \nThe same restrictions apply to exhibit P-B—i.e., nobody shall review or handle these \nletters without express authorization and oversight from the Court. The purpose of this \nrestriction is to preserve the integrity of the physical exhibit for the Fifth Circuit. Exhibit \nP-B was also submitted in PDF format. See Record Document 564-5. The Court, however, \nfound the photographs/scans to be unhelpful and the physical evidence more reliable. \n155 \n   \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 641   Filed 11/01/22   Page 156 of 165 PageID #: \n35382\nhave tape on them, which O’Brien did not apply. Id. ¶ 24. Unlike Ormon, O’Brien utilized \na unique method of cutting open the envelopes—she largely cut the envelopes on the side \nstarting at the stamp. Id. ¶ 14. The physical evidence, however, is inconsistent with her \ntestimony at times. \nEight of the twelve envelopes she reviewed show no signs of being opened other \nthan  her  cut  along  the  side.  These  envelopes  appear  sealed  by  the  adhesive \nnotwithstanding the tape. See Exs. P-B-002, 005/006,94 017, 018, 028, 023, 026, and 032 \n[Record Document 564-5 at 3-4, 7-10, 13-16, 23-24, 19-22, 25-26]. Accordingly, the \nCourt finds that Plaintiffs have failed to show that these eight envelopes were opened by \nsomeone other than O’Brien.  \nThe envelopes admitted as Exs. P-B-001 and P-B-020 [Record Document 564-5 at \n1-2, 17-18] are also unhelpful for Plaintiffs. As to Ex. P-B-001 [Record Document 564-5 \nat 1-2], the envelope shows no signs of being sealed with the adhesive; the only evidence \nof it being sealed is by the piece of tape. A part of the envelope, however, has been \ndamaged by the tape indicating the envelope was opened. Unfortunately for Plaintiffs, \nO’Brien’s stipulated testimony is broad and does not identify this specific letter—or any \nletter—to rule herself out as being responsible for the damage. In sum, there are too many \nalternative explanations such that the Court cannot conclude DWCC was responsible for \nopening this envelope.   \n \n94 P-B-005 and P-B-006 appear to be duplicates. Plaintiffs provided the Court with a \ncombined hard copy containing only one envelope.  \n156 \n   \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 641   Filed 11/01/22   Page 157 of 165 PageID #: \n35383\nTurning to Ex. P-B-020 [Record Document 564-5 at 17-18], this envelope does not \nappear ripped open because there are no signs of damage to the adhesive area. Instead, it \nappears as if the adhesive lost its stick. Simply put, Plaintiffs have failed to convince the \nCourt that DWCC opened this letter.   \nExs. P-B-004 and P-B-014 [Record Document 564-5 at 5-6, 11-12], however, were \nopened by someone at DWCC. First, Ex. P-B-004 [Record Document 564-5 at 5-6] has \nbeen cleanly cut open at the top, similar to the envelopes marked as Exs. P-C-23/24, \n208/209, and 246/247 [Record Document 564]. Even though O’Brien did not open it from \nthe side like her normal technique, the Court finds her testimony that she did not place the \ntape on the envelope to be credible. For the same reasons as the Court articulated for the \nenvelopes marked as Exs. P-C-23/24, 208/209, and 246/247 [Record Document 564], the \nCourt concludes that DWCC opened this envelope.   \n  Ex. P-B-014 [Record Document 564-5 at 11-12] is a clear example of an envelope \nbeing opened by a DWCC personnel. This envelope has been cleanly opened from the top \nand  then  taped  closed.  Additionally,  O’Brien  cut  the  envelope  open  from  the  side, \nconsistent with her normal technique, and left the top of the envelope taped closed. In \neffect, O’Brien retrieved the envelope and preserved the evidence to show that it was \ntaped closed when it arrived in the mail. Like the letters marked as Exs. P-B-004 [Record \nDocument 564-5 at 5-6] and P-C-23/24, 208/209, and 246/247 [Record Document 564], \nthe only logical explanation for the cut at the top of the envelope is that it was caused by a \nDWCC employee. For the same reasons detailed above, the Court concludes that DWCC \nopened this envelope.     \n157 \n   \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 641   Filed 11/01/22   Page 158 of 165 PageID #: \n35384\nThe  Court  also  heard  conflicting  testimony  as  to  who  applied  the  tape  to  the \nenvelopes in the P-B and P-C exhibits. Who applied the tape to the envelopes under the \ncircumstances of this case is not relevant. It is far too large of a logical leap to conclude \nthat the mere presence of tape—even assuming DWCC placed the tape on the envelope—\nmeans someone opened the envelopes. Indeed, as shown above, many of the envelopes \nappeared sealed by the adhesive notwithstanding the tape, and most of the envelopes are \ninconclusive as to when the adhesive was broken.  \nIn sum, Plaintiffs proved the following relevant facts: 1) from approximately 2016 \nto 2020, Disability Rights received hundreds of letters from inmates at DWCC; 2) of the \nhundreds of envelopes received from inmates at DWCC, five to ten percent had tape \napplied to the envelopes; and 3) of the 116 envelopes submitted as evidence, DWCC \nopened five pieces of legal mail, which constituted five violations of department policy. \nJust as Plaintiffs’ incoming legal mail claim failed for lack of proof, so too here. \nThe mere fact that five envelopes were opened does not prove that someone read—let \nalone censored—outgoing legal mail. There is no evidence that someone opened and \nremoved a piece of outgoing legal mail. Cf. Brewer, 3 F.3d at 825-26 (denying a motion \nfor summary judgment based on allegations that officials removed legal material). In \nshort,  Plaintiffs’  evidence  is  far  too  weak  and  circumstantial  to  prove  censorship  of \noutgoing legal mail.  \nThis is not to say Plaintiffs’ concerns and investigation were meritless. But the \nCourt’s task is to review the evidence before it. To that end, Plaintiffs have simply failed \nto carry their burden in showing that Defendants are nefariously opening legal mail and \n158 \n   \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 641   Filed 11/01/22   Page 159 of 165 PageID #: \n35385\ninterfering  with  or  censoring  Plaintiffs’  free  speech  rights.  Accordingly,  Plaintiffs’ \nincoming and outgoing legal mail claims are dismissed.  \nC.  Retaliation  \nPlaintiffs  have  argued  that  DWCC  officials  retaliated  against  inmates  for \nparticipating in this lawsuit. It appears Plaintiffs’ evidence of retaliation is designed to \nlend support to their claim that legal mail is being opened for an illegitimate purpose and \nis  not  designed  to  support  a  class-wide  claim  of  retaliation  in  violation  of  the  First \nAmendment. The Court finds that a class-wide claim of retaliation is not before it. Indeed, \nPlaintiffs did not even brief the retaliation legal standard, and they addressed allegations \nof retaliation within the legal mail section of their brief. See Record Document 573 at 165, \nn.974. Instead, it appears Plaintiffs offered evidence of alleged retaliation to show the \nconsequences of DWCC opening and reading the legal mail and for the Court to make the \ninference that DWCC staff read the legal mail and then censored free speech through \nretaliatory conduct. As the Court stated above, Plaintiffs’ evidence is far too weak for the \nCourt to make any such inferences. Although the Court believes no further discussion is \nwarranted, out of an abundance of caution, the Court will briefly explain why Plaintiffs \nalso failed to prove a class-wide retaliation claim.   \n“It is well established that prison officials may not retaliate against an inmate \nbecause that inmate exercised his right of access to the courts.” McDonald v. Steward, 132 \nF.3d 225, 231 (5th Cir. 1998). To prevail on a retaliation claim, a plaintiff must prove: 1) \nthe exercise of a specific constitutional right; 2) the defendants’ intent to retaliate for the \nexercise of that right; 3) a retaliatory adverse act; and 4) causation, which in this context \n159 \n   \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 641   Filed 11/01/22   Page 160 of 165 PageID #: \n35386\nmeans that, but for the retaliatory motive, the complained-of incident would not have \noccurred. Id. Courts must “carefully scrutinize” retaliation claims to “assure that prisoners \ndo not inappropriately insulate themselves from disciplinary actions by drawing the shield \nof retaliation around them.” Woods v. Smith, 60 F.3d 1161, 1166 (5th Cir. 1995). “The \nprospect of endless claims of retaliation on the part of inmates would disrupt prison \nofficials in the discharge of their most basic duties. Claims of retaliation must therefore be \nregarded with skepticism, lest federal courts embroil themselves in every disciplinary act \nthat occurs in state penal institutions.” Id. (quoting Adams v. Rice, 40 F.3d 72, 74 (4th Cir. \n1994)). The Fifth Circuit “places a significant burden on the inmate,” and “conclusory \nallegations of retaliation” will not suffice. Id. (citation omitted).  \nInmates  testified  that  they  felt  DWCC  staff  retaliated  against  them  for \ncommunicating with legal counsel. First, Turner testified that Colonel Nail disciplined \nhim for having his jumpsuit around his waist, which prevented his transfer to general \npopulation.  Turner  Trial  Tr.  vol.  I  at  80:11-82:2  [Record  Document  533].  Second, \nBrumfield testified that staff asked him general questions about the suit but never about \nthe specifics. Brumfield Trial Tr. vol. I at 169:3-23 [Record Document 533]. Third, Dillon \ntestified that he felt intimidated and threatened by staff and that at one point, his property \nwent missing.95 Dillon Trial Tr. vol. I at 274:16-275:16 [Record Document 533].  \nPlaintiffs also contend that Defendants coerced prisoners into disassociating with \nthis litigation by moving them to a more favorable housing assignment. In other words, \n \n95 The Court found that some of the testimony within the cited-to lines of Brumfield’s and \nDillon’s testimony regarding retaliation was vague and unreliable, and the Court only \nfound the facts specifically stated above were established.   \n160 \n   \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 641   Filed 11/01/22   Page 161 of 165 PageID #: \n35387\nPlaintiffs allege that  Defendants  used extended lockdown to intimidate prisoners into \nwithdrawing from the lawsuit. In support, Plaintiffs point to the suspicious withdrawals of \nAnthony Tellis and Damonte Henry from the suit. See Record Documents 171, 174, 197.  \nAnthony  Tellis  withdrew  from  the  suit  in  March  2019  and  Colonel  Nail \nsubsequently moved him to CCR, which afforded Tellis greater privileges than inmates on \nextended lockdown. See Record Documents 171, 174; Nail Trial Tr. vol. VIII at 1703:1-8, \n1887:4-1888:20 [Record Document 542]. Plaintiffs, however, failed to establish the date \nTellis was moved to CCR. And Colonel Nail testified that Tellis was moved to CCR \nbecause he met the requirements for protective custody, such as improved conduct and \npotentially being a security risk in general population. See Nail Trial Tr. vol. VIII at \n1887:4-1888:20 [Record Document 542].  \nMoving to Henry, Plaintiffs cross-examined Colonel Nail about letters he received \nfrom Henry. In these letters, Henry referred to “trying to come to an agreement with you \nconcerning the lawsuit the Advocacy is filing,” “a previous agreement we talked about,” \nand requested to “speak with you as soon as possible to make sure you keep your word.” \nExs. P-KK-122 [Record Document 564-123], P-KK-123 [Record Document 564-124]. He \nalso stated that he “gave you 9, almost 10 months without a write up.” Record Document \n564-123.  In  another  letter  to  Colonel  Nail,  Henry  reported  that  he  had  “cut  off  all \ncommunications with the lawyers at the Advocacy Center” and points out, “I kept my \nword, so please do the same.” Ex. P-KK-124 [Record Document 564-125].  \nAs  the  Court  has  previously  stated,  see  Record  Document  197,  there  are  two \npossible interpretations to the letters. In one, Henry and Colonel Nail agreed that if Henry \n161 \n   \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 641   Filed 11/01/22   Page 162 of 165 PageID #: \n35388\nmaintained positive behavior record for a period of time, he would be transferred out of \nextended lockdown—an appropriate exercise of discretion afforded prison officials. On \nthe other hand, these letters may indicate that Colonel Nail and Henry agreed that if Henry \nrefused to continue his involvement with the lawsuit, he then would be transferred out of \nextended  lockdown—an  attempt  to  interfere  with  the  lawsuit  and  undermine  First \nAmendment  rights  by  exploiting  the  potentially  coercive  nature  of  the  carceral \nenvironment.  \nPlaintiffs, however, did not subpoena Henry to testify about the content of the \nletters. The letters were thus deemed hearsay and were not admitted for the truth of the \nmatter asserted. Nail Trial Tr. vol. VIII at 1898:7-12, 1900:20-23, 1902:11-12 [Record \nDocument 542]. Colonel Nail also denied speaking to Henry about the lawsuit, and he \nstated that he did not make any deals with Henry regarding the lawsuit. He testified that he \nonly discussed Henry’s behavior and getting off extended lockdown. See id. at 1901:3-\n1902:20. Additionally, after being notified that his prior letters were being misconstrued, \nHenry sent a follow-up letter to Colonel Nail stating that he was “writing to clarify and \ndissolve the implications about anything being offer [sic] to me as a deal from you or any \nother employee at David Wade Correctional Center” and that Colonel Nail “told me give \nyou [sic] good behavior and you would see about me making the board.” Ex. P-KK-125 \n[Record Document 564-126].96 In short, although the withdrawals of Tellis and Henry \n \n96 Like the other letters, this letter was not accepted for the truth of the statements made \nwithin. The Court finds that Henry’s interests were no longer aligned with the Class such \nthat the statements cannot qualify as statements of an opposing party. Additionally, Henry \n162 \n   \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 641   Filed 11/01/22   Page 163 of 165 PageID #: \n35389\nwere suspicious, Plaintiffs failed to present persuasive evidence to establish that Colonel \nNail’s conduct was retaliatory or exploitative as opposed to an appropriate exercise of \ndiscretion afforded to prison officials regarding housing assignments.  \nIn  summary,  the  Court  finds  that  Plaintiffs  offer  no  analysis  of  a  standalone \nretaliation claim in their post-trial brief, so it appears that it has been abandoned. More to \nthe  point,  Plaintiffs  failed  to  produce  any  credible  evidence  of  pervasive  retaliatory \nconduct. As to the individual claims of retaliation, the Court finds that they also fail \nbecause the testimony was vague, conclusory, and without further evidentiary support \naside from the inmates’ own subjective beliefs of retaliation. Simply put, Plaintiffs failed \nto introduce sufficient evidence to support a retaliation claim at the class level.  \nD.  Conclusion as to the Plaintiffs’ First Amendment Claims \nThe Court finds that Plaintiffs have failed to prove that DWCC is violating the \nClass’s First Amendment rights by opening and reading incoming and outgoing prisoner \nlegal mail or otherwise retaliating against prisoners for exercising their First Amendment \nrights. Defendants are entitled to dismissal of these claims. Accordingly, Plaintiffs’ First \nAmendment claims will be dismissed with prejudice at the appropriate time.97 \nVII.  Conclusion \nBased on the foregoing reasons, the Court finds that Defendants, in their official \ncapacities, are violating the Eighth Amendment rights of the Class and the ADA and RA \nrights of the Subclass. The Court finds that the conditions on the South Compound rise to \n \nnever became a Named Plaintiff. In short, Defendants have failed to convince the Court \nthat the statements are not hearsay or fall under an exception to the hearsay rule.   \n97 At this time, the Court is not certifying any part of the opinion as a final judgment.  \n163 \n   \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 641   Filed 11/01/22   Page 164 of 165 PageID #: \n35390\nthe level of an Eighth Amendment violation due to the psychological harms of solitary \nconfinement, the physical composition of the South Compound, the length of time an \ninmate remains on extended lockdown, the treatment of the mentally ill, and DWCC’s \ndisciplinary practices on the unit. Additionally, the Court finds an Eighth Amendment \nviolation in DWCC’s delivery of mental health services. Specifically, the Court finds \nconstitutional  violations  in  the  screening  and  evaluation  processes,  mental  health \ntreatment options available to inmates (and the lack thereof), the lack of adequate mental \nhealth staffing, the lack of safeguards for the administration of psychotropic medications, \nthe  inaccuracy  and  insufficiency  of  medical  records,  and  the  failures  of  the  suicide \nprevention program. The evidence at trial also supports Plaintiffs’ ADA and RA claims \nthat  there  are  no  reasonable  accommodations  for  inmates  with  mental  illness  in  the \nextended lockdowns units at DWCC, nor are there reasonable accommodations related to \ndiscipline and the use of force on those with mental illness.98 However, the Court does not \nfind  that  the  evidence  presented  at  trial  supports  the  Plaintiffs’  claim  that  DWCC \ndisregards recommendations from mental health staff about extended lockdown of inmates \nwith mental illness. Instead, the Court holds that mental health is not, but should be, \ninvolved in the classification system. Regarding Plaintiffs’ First Amendment claims, the \nCourt finds in favor of Defendants; the First Amendment claims will be dismissed with \nprejudice at the appropriate time. \n \n98 This is the only claim for which Defendant Louisiana Department of Public Safety and \nCorrections is liable.

CIVIL ACTION NO. 18-541   \n \nVERSUS  JUDGE ELIZABETH E. FOOTE \n \nJAMES M. LEBLANC, ET AL.  MAGISTRATE JUDGE HORNSBY \n \n \nMEMORANDUM RULING \n \n  This is a suit for injunctive relief, not money damages. Before the Court is a motion for class \ncertification, filed by Plaintiffs Bruce Charles, Carlton Turner, Larry Jones, and Ronald Brooks \n(collectively, “Named Plaintiffs”).1 Record Documents 2 and 397. Plaintiffs seek certification of a class \nconsisting of “all prisoners who are or will be subjected to extended lockdown at David Wade \nCorrectional Center” and a subclass consisting of “all individuals on extended lockdown at David Wade \nCorrectional Center who have or are perceived as having a qualifying disability related to mental health, \nas defined within the Americans with Disabilities Act.” Record Document 2-1 at 3. Defendants oppose \ncertification of both classes. Record Document 131. After a lengthy discovery period, both parties have \nfiled supplemental briefing on the issue of class certification, and the motion is now ripe for review. \nRecord Documents 397, 407, and 412. For the reasons stated herein, Plaintiffs’ motion [Record \nDocument 2] is GRANTED.  \nI.  Background  \nDavid Wade Correctional Center (“DWCC”) is prison located in Claiborne Parish, Louisiana. \nThe facility is divided into two compounds—the North Compound and the South Compound. Record \n \n1 The Advocacy Center, now known as Disability Rights Louisiana, is also a Plaintiff in this \nmatter but is not a party to the motion for class certification. Record Documents 157, 178, and 316. \n1 \n \n \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 462   Filed 09/20/21   Page 2 of 28 PageID #:  23230\nDocument 397-4 at 5. The South Compound, which is at issue in this case, has five buildings—N-1 \nthrough  N-5.  Id.  As  of March  2020,  buildings N-1  through  N-4  housed  inmates  on extended \nlockdown.2 Id. Inmates in buildings N-1 through N-3 are generally housed in cells holding two people \nwhile inmates in building N-4 are in single cells. Id. \nThis suit was filed by several inmates at DWCC seeking to challenge the conditions of \nconfinement for inmates on extended lockdown at DWCC and to challenge the mental health care \nprovided to inmates on extended lockdown. Record Document 316. Plaintiffs allege that DWCC’s \npolicies and practices are a violation of the Eighth Amendment, the First Amendment, the Americans \nwith Disabilities Act (“ADA”), and the Rehabilitation Act (“RA”). They seek certification of two \nclasses. First, a class comprised of all prisoners who are or will be subjected to extended lockdown at \nDWCC that will pursue the Eighth Amendment and First Amendment claims. Second, a subclass of \nall individuals on extended lockdown at DWCC who have or are perceived as having a qualifying \ndisability related to mental health, as defined within the Americans with Disabilities Act that will pursue \nthe ADA and RA claims.  \nII.  Class Certification \nA.  General Requirements \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 23 governs certification of class actions in federal court. Under \nthis rule, the party seeking certification of a class has the burden of demonstrating that the prerequisites \nof Rule 23(a) are met and that the class is of a type listed in Rule 23(b). Chavez v. Plan Benefit Servs., Inc., \n957 F.3d 542, 545–46 (5th Cir. 2020) (citing Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., v. Dukes, 564 U.S. 338, 350 (2011)); \n \n2 As discussed in more detail below, Defendants have presented evidence that, as of March \n2021, it is no longer the case that all inmates in buildings N-1 through N-4 are housed in extended \nlockdown conditions. For the reasons expressed below, the Court considers the evidence as of March \n2020. \n2 \n \n \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 462   Filed 09/20/21   Page 3 of 28 PageID #:  23231\nM.D. ex rel. Stukenberg v. Perry, 675 F.3d 832, 837 (5th Cir. 2012). Rule 23(a) contains the following \nprerequisites:  \n(1) the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable; \n \n(2) there are questions of law or fact common to the class; \n \n(3) the claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or \ndefenses of the class; and \n \n(4) the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class. \nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(1)–(4). In this case, Plaintiffs seek certification as a class and subclass pursuant to \nRule 23(b)(2) which permits litigants to proceed as a class when “the party opposing the class has acted \nor refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class, so that final injunctive relief or \ncorresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a whole.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2).  \nDistrict courts have broad discretion in determining whether to certify a class, though it must \n“rigorously analyze” the prerequisites for class certification contained in Rule 23 before doing so. Prantil \nv. Arkema Inc., 986 F.3d 570, 574 (5th Cir. 2021) (quoting Spence v. Glock, G.m.b.H., 227 F.3d 308, 310 \n(5th Cir. 2000)). This analysis requires “the district court to go beyond the pleadings to determine \nwhether the requirements of Rule 23 have been met: ‘a court must understand the claims, defenses, \nrelevant facts, and applicable substantive law in order to make a meaningful determination of the \ncertification issues.’” Id. (quoting Cole v. Gen. Motors Corp., 484 F.3d 717, 724 (5th Cir. 2007)). A court \ncannot “merely ‘review a complaint and ask whether, taking the facts as the party seeking the class \npresents them, the case seems suitable for class treatment.’” Chavez, 957 F.3d at 546 (quoting Spano v. \nBoeing Co., 633 F.3d 574, 583 (7th Cir. 2011)) (emphasis in original).  \nB.  Numerosity \n \nRule 23(a) requires that a class be “so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable.” \nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(1). To meet this requirement, plaintiffs “must ordinarily demonstrate some \n3 \n \n \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 462   Filed 09/20/21   Page 4 of 28 PageID #:  23232\nevidence or reasonable estimate of the number of purported class members.” Ibe v. Jones, 836 F.3d 516, \n528 (5th Cir. 2016) (quoting Zeidman v. J. Ray McDermott & Co., Inc., 651 F.2d 1030, 1038 (5th Cir. \n1981)).  \nThe number of members in a proposed class alone, however, is not determinative of whether \njoinder of all members is practicable. Id. Factors such as “geographical dispersion of the class, the ease \nwith which class members may be identified, the nature of the action, and the size of each plaintiff’s \nclaim” are relevant considerations. Id. (quoting Zeidman, 651 F.2d at 1038). “[S]maller classes are less \nobjectionable where . . . the plaintiff is seeking injunctive relief on behalf of future class members as \nwell as past and present members.” Haab v. City of Bossier City, No. 16-CV-1663, 2018 WL 1220570, at \n*4 (W.D. La. Mar. 8, 2018) (quoting Jones v. Diamond, 519 F.2d 1090, 1100 (5th Cir. 1975)). The fluid \nnature of a class, like that in prison litigation cases, may also counsel “in favor of certification of all \npresent and future members.” Lewis v. Cain, 324 F.R.D. 159, 168 (M.D. La. 2018).  \n1.  The Class \nPlaintiffs argue that they have satisfied the numerosity requirements for the class of inmates \nwho are currently or will in the future be subjected to extended lockdown in buildings N-1 through N-\n4 at DWCC because, as of March 2020, there were 366 inmates housed in these buildings and because \nit is impossible to identify and join individuals who will be housed there in the future. Record \nDocument 397 at 11. Defendants raise two main arguments in opposition. Record Document 407 at \n11–13. First, they argue that it is inadequate for Plaintiffs to present evidence of the number of inmates \nhoused in buildings N-1 through N-4 as of March 2020; they maintain that the Court must consider \nthe present conditions. Id. at 11. Second, they note the differences between the conditions on individual \ntiers within buildings N-1 through N-4 and contend that these differences render Plaintiffs’ proposed \nclass and subclass overbroad. Id. at 12.  \n4 \n \n \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 462   Filed 09/20/21   Page 5 of 28 PageID #:  23233\nAs an initial matter, the Court will consider the evidence as of March 2020 for purposes of class \ncertification. Per the Court’s order in effect at the time the parties filed their supplemental briefing \nregarding class certification, discovery closed in March 2020. Record Document 378. Thus, evidence \nconcerning conditions at DWCC in March 2020 was the most up-to-date information available to \nPlaintiffs when they supplemented their motion for class certification. See Dunn v. Dunn, 318 F.R.D. \n652, 661–62 (M.D. Ala. 2016) (basing a numerosity finding in September 2016 on data from March \n2015 because that was “the date of the most recent records available to plaintiffs”). \nThe  Court  turns  next  to  assessing  whether  the  putative  class  satisfies  the  numerosity \nrequirement. Plaintiffs have presented evidence that in March 2020, there were 366 individuals housed \nin  extended  lockdown  in  buildings  N-1  through  N-4.  Record  Document  397-6  at  86.  While \ngeographically compact, 366 individuals is sufficiently numerous that joinder of each party would be \nimpracticable, especially given that the class includes those who may be housed on extended lockdown \nin buildings N-1 through N-4 in the future and, as this Court has previously addressed at length, the \nclass is a fluid population. Record Document 315. \nDefendants do not dispute the accuracy of Plaintiffs’ calculations of the number of inmates \nheld in buildings N-1 through N-4 and instead present evidence that all of those housed in buildings \nN-1 through N-4 are not currently being held under extended lockdown conditions. Record Document \n407 at 11–12. To support this, they cite to an expert report issued by James Upchurch. Id. This report, \ndated March 5, 2021, describes the “current manner in which N-1 through N-4 tiers are being used.” \nRecord Document 407-6 at 11 (emphasis added). He states that building N-1 is currently being used to \nhouse 128 medium custody offenders.3 Id. The report does not state whether building N-1 was being \n \n3 At present, building N-1 is not holding 128 inmates because two tiers within the building are \nonly being filled to fifty percent of their capacity due to Covid-19 precautions. Record Document 407-\n6 at 11. With the precautions, the building is holding 96 inmates.   \n5 \n \n \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 462   Filed 09/20/21   Page 6 of 28 PageID #:  23234\nused to house offenders in medium capacity in March 2020, and thus, the Court cannot conclude from \nthis evidence that Plaintiffs’ calculations are incorrect. The Court, therefore, finds that the putative \nclass has satisfied the numerosity requirement.  \n2.  The Subclass \nPlaintiffs were not able to provide the same concrete numbers regarding members of the \nsubclass of individuals on extended lockdown who have or are perceived as having a qualifying \ndisability related to mental health housed in extended lockdown in buildings N-1 through N-4. Record \nDocument 397 at 11. However, they estimate that approximately forty-eight inmates on extended \nlockdown have a serious mental illness (“SMI”) actually diagnosed by DWCC officials.4 Id. Plaintiffs \nalso provided estimates of how many inmates they believe to be a member of the subclass, even if they \nare not diagnosed as having an SMI by DWCC. First, they cite an estimate from their expert, Dr. \nKathryn Burns, that between 240 and 270 inmates on DWCC’s South Compound have a mental \nillness.5 Record Documents 397 at 11 and 397-3 at 23. Second, they cite a DWCC mental health care \nprovider’s estimate that between twenty-five and forty percent of inmates in extended lockdown have \na mental illness. Record Documents 397 at 11 and 397-8 at 8–9. From this, they conclude that the \nsubclass is likely between 92 and 146 inmates. Record Document 397 at 12.  \nDefendants argue that Plaintiffs’ “crude” formula regarding the population with an SMI as \ndiagnosed by DWCC is insufficient. Record Document at 12. They also argue once again that the \n \n4 Plaintiffs reached this estimate using data provided by DWCC regarding the number of \ninmates in its facility as a whole diagnosed with an SMI and the percentage of the overall DWCC \npopulation housed in buildings N-1 through N-4. Record Document 397 at 11. They reason that \nbecause there are 159 inmates with an SMI diagnoses at DWCC and approximately thirty percent of \ninmates are housed in buildings N-1 through N-4, approximately forty-eight inmates in buildings N-1 \nthrough N-4 have an SMI diagnosis. Id.  \n5 The South Compound at DWCC include building N-5 in addition to buildings N-1 through \nN-4.  \n6 \n \n \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 462   Filed 09/20/21   Page 7 of 28 PageID #:  23235\npopulation included in Plaintiffs’ estimates are not similarly situated. Id. For example, they note that \nPlaintiffs’ estimates include inmates with a diagnosed SMI that are stable. Id.  \nThe  Court  is  satisfied  that  Plaintiffs’  estimates  are  sufficient  to  satisfy  the  numerosity \nrequirement for the subclass. All estimates of the class are greater than forty, which the Fifth Circuit \nhas previously implied is sufficiently numerous. Abboud v. Agentra, LLC, No. 3:19-CV-00120-X, 2020 \nWL 5526557, at *3 (N.D. Tex. Sept. 14, 2020) (citing Mullen v. Treasure Chest Casino, LLC, 186 F.3d 620, \n624 (5th Cir. 1999)). Like the class, the subclass includes future members and the population is fluid, \nwhich makes joinder impracticable. The Court, therefore, finds that the putative subclass has satisfied \nthe numerosity requirement.  \nC.  Commonality \nRule 23(a) next requires that the party seeking class certification show that “there are questions \nof law or fact common to the class.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(2). To establish commonality, plaintiffs must \npresent more than “questions that are common to the class ‘because any competently crafted class \ncomplaint literally raises common questions.’” Lewis, 324 F.R.D. at 169 (quoting Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., \n564 U.S. at 350). Plaintiffs must instead “demonstrate that the class members ‘have suffered the same \ninjury.’” Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 564 U.S. at 350 (quoting Gen. Tel. Co. of Sw. v. Falcon, 457 U.S. 147, 157 \n(1982)). The Fifth Circuit has explained that this means that “class members must raise at least one \ncontention that is central to the validity of each class member’s claims[, b]ut this contention need not \nrelate specifically to the damages component of the class members’ claims.” In re Deepwater Horizon, 739 \nF.3d 790, 810 (5th Cir. 2014). Thus, “[e]ven an instance of injurious conduct, which would usually \nrelate more directly to the defendant’s liability than to the claimant’s damages, may constitute ‘the same \ninjury.’” Id. In sum, the “principal requirement of Wal-Mart is merely a single common contention that \nenables the class action ‘to generate common answers apt to drive the resolution of the litigation.’” Id. \n7 \n \n \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 462   Filed 09/20/21   Page 8 of 28 PageID #:  23236\nat 811 (quoting Perry, 675 F.3d at 840) (emphasis in original). Stated differently, putative class plaintiffs \nmust identify a common contention that is “of such a nature . . . that determination of its truth or \nfalsity will resolve an issue that is central to the validity of each of the claims in one stroke.” Lewis, 324 \nF.R.D. at 169 (quoting Wal-Mart, 564 U.S. at 350). In order to determine whether the commonality \nstandard is met, a court’s analysis may require “some overlap with the merits of the plaintiff’s underlying \nclaim.” Wal-Mart, 564 U.S. at 351. \n1.  The Class \nPlaintiffs are pursuing Eighth Amendment and First Amendment claims on behalf of the class. \nThe putative class in this matter seeks injunctive relief, not money damages. As to the Eighth \nAmendment, the putative class alleges that DWCC’s policies and practices unconstitutionally expose it \nto a substantial risk of serious harm. Record Document 316 ¶s 290–94. It claims that DWCC violates \nthe putative class’s First Amendment rights through its practice of opening legal mail from prisoners \nto attorneys and from attorneys to prisoners outside the presence of the prisoner. Id. ¶s 310–11. The \nCourt will address each constitutional claim individually.  \nThe Eighth Amendment provides that “[p]rison officials must provide humane conditions of \nconfinement; they must ensure that inmates receive adequate food, clothing, shelter, and medical care, \nand must take reasonable measure to ensure the safety of the inmates.” Gates v. Cook, 376 F.3d 323, \n332 (5th Cir. 2004). “Mental health needs are no less serious than physical needs.” Id. The elements of \nan Eighth Amendment claim are met when  a prison official “1) shows a subjective  deliberate \nindifference to 2) conditions posing a substantial risk of serious harm to the inmate.” Id. at 333. In a \nclass context, plaintiffs must “identify a unified common policy, practice, or course of conduct that is \nthe source of their alleged injury.” Dockery v. Fischer, 253 F. Supp. 3d 832, 846 (N.D. Miss. 2016). This \npolicy “need not be formal or officially-adopted” but may instead be “identified on the basis of custom \n8 \n \n \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 462   Filed 09/20/21   Page 9 of 28 PageID #:  23237\nor consistent practice.” Id. at 846–47. “Failure to act can also constitute a policy or practice.” Id. at 848. \nA plaintiff must also “connect[] the policy or practice to the alleged harm.” Id. at 847. \nHere, Plaintiffs have sorted their Eighth Amendment claims into two broad categories. First, \nthat the conditions of confinement for inmates on extended lockdown are inhumane and expose the \nclass to a serious risk of harm. Record Document 397 at 14. Second, that DWCC’s mental health care \nis inadequate to detect and prevent severe psychological harm to inmates housed in extended lockdown. \nId. at 16. \nThe Court turns first to policies related to the conditions of confinement. Plaintiffs allege that \ninmates in extended lockdown are exposed to a substantial risk of harm by policies causing or related \nto social isolation, enforced idleness, and indefinite exposure to extended lockdown conditions. Record \nDocument 397 at 14–16. They cite to evidence demonstrating that inmates on extended lockdown are \nusually confined to their cell for twenty-three hours per day; that those on “yard restriction” are \nconfined to their cell for nearly twenty-four hours per day, except for fifty minutes of “yard time” per \nweekend; that inmates in buildings N-2 through N-4 are denied all rehabilitative programming while \ninmates in building N-1 are permitted to attend one “re-entry” class per week and eat in a common \narea; and that phone calls are limited to ten minutes per month. Record Documents 397 at 14, 397-2 \nat 45–47, 397-3 at 5, 8, and 27, and 397-12 at 2. Plaintiffs cite evidence that, during the limited times \nputative class members are allowed outside, they are confined in cages that are too small to allow for \nmeaningful physical activity; that putative class members are permitted one religious book, three books \nor magazines, and no radios, crafts, or televisions, except for inmates in building N-1 who share a \ncommon television. Record Documents 397 at 14–15, 397-2 at 46, 47, and 63, and 397-12 at 2. Finally, \nthey cite evidence that putative class members on extended lockdown are kept housed on extended \n9 \n \n \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 462   Filed 09/20/21   Page 10 of 28 PageID #: \n23238\nlockdown indefinitely, with only “perfunctory” reviews every ninety days. Record Documents 397 at \n15, 397-4 at 6, and 397-5 at 8. \nPlaintiffs presented opinions from two experts, Dr. Craig Haney and Dr. Kathryn Burns, that \nthe aforementioned conditions present every member of the putative class with a substantial risk of \nharm including: \nappetite and sleep  disturbances, anxiety, panic, a sense  of impending emotional \nbreakdown, lethargy, hypersensitivity to stimuli, irritability, aggression, rage, loss of \ncontrol,  ruminations,  paranoia,  perceptual  distortions,  cognitive  dysfunction, \nhallucinations, depression, self-mutilation, suicidal ideation and behavior, and social \nwithdrawal. \n \nRecord Documents 397 at 15, 397-2 at 8–33, 95, and 397-3 at 8–11. \n  Next, the Court turns to the second category of Eighth Amendment claims identified by \nPlaintiffs—the mental health care provided to inmates on extended lockdown. Plaintiffs present expert \nopinions from Dr. Burns, Dr. Haney, and Dan Pacholke outlining why they believe DWCC’s mental \nhealth care fails to meet the criteria required for mental health care as stated in Ruiz v. Estelle, 503 F. \nSupp. 1265 (S.D. Tex. 1980), aff’d in part, rev’d in part, 679 F.2d 1115 (5th Cir. 1982). Record Documents \n397 at 16, 397-2 at 50–54, 397-3 at 12–32, and 397-4 at 36–43. The Ruiz criteria are: systematic screening \nand evaluation; treatment that is more than mere seclusion or close supervision; participation by trained \nmental health professionals in appropriate numbers; safeguards against psychotropic medications that \nare prescribed in dangerous amounts, without adequate supervision or otherwise inappropriately \nadministered; accurate, complete and confidential records; and a suicide prevention program. Ruiz, 503 \nF. Supp. at 1339.  \nPlaintiffs present evidence that, among other things: the DWCC staff member with the most \nresponsibility for the mental health care provided to the putative class is “poorly trained, unqualified, \nand unlicensed”; this staff member “conducts psychotherapy” despite lacking training or a license to \n10 \n \n \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 462   Filed 09/20/21   Page 11 of 28 PageID #: \n23239\ndo so; the only licensed clinical social worker employed at the facility “does not routinely go on rounds \nin the prison”; all staff providing mental health care on extended lockdown lack knowledge of the \nconditions under which inmates on extended lockdown actually live and as to the psychological effects \nof solitary confinement; there are only two counselors for all of the South Compound; there is one \npsychiatrist who works only sixteen hours per month serving all inmates at DWCC; screening and \nevaluation for mental illness is inconsistent, brief, and performed by unqualified individuals; the only \nmental health treatment provided to inmates on extended lockdown is medication, which is not always \nconsistently administered; medication administration records are not accurate; each inmate with an \nidentified mental health treatment plan has an identical “individualized” treatment plan; and DWCC’s \nsuicide prevention approach is to deprive the prisoner of his property, clothing, mattress, and bedding, \nwithout providing treatment or conducting a risk assessment. Record Documents 397 at 15–16, 397-2 \nat 50, 73–79, 397-3 at 14, 13–29, and 397-4 at 39. \nPlaintiffs also cite evidence related to the alleged substantial risk of harm provided by the \naforementioned inadequacies in the system. For example, Drs. Burns and Haney reported after \ninterviews with inmates on extended lockdown that many were suffering from psychiatric symptoms; \nthat in one set of interviews Dr. Haney discovered that at least half of the interviewees reported possible \nhallucinations; and that many reported attempting suicide in the past or had been placed on suicide \nwatch for expressing such thoughts. Record Documents 397 at 17–18, 397-2 at 54–71, and 397-3 at \n48–98. They presented opinion evidence from expert Dan Pacholke that DWCC’s extended lockdown \nconditions are “far more restrictive and stark than the national norm,” are “inconsistent with generally \naccepted penological practices,” and “do not support the penological interests of safety and security \nwithin the prison.” Record Document 397-4 at 11. \n11 \n \n \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 462   Filed 09/20/21   Page 12 of 28 PageID #: \n23240\nBased on the above, Plaintiffs identified the following questions that are common to the class \nas a whole: \n (1)  whether  DWCC’s  policies  of  social  isolation,  enforced  idleness,  indefinite \nexposure [to extended lockdown], and inadequate mental health care substantially \nincreased  class  members’  risks  of  serious  harm;  (2)  whether  Defendants  were \ndeliberately indifferent to these risks; (3) whether confining prisoners to cells for nearly \nall of every day for indefinite durations unconstitutionally risks serious harm; (4) \nwhether 50 minutes of ‘rec yard’ time five days per week in a cage is constitutionally \nadequate; (5) whether and to what extent DWCC may constitutionally place prisoners \non ‘yard restriction’ to one 50-minute rec yard session per week; (6) whether DWCC’s \nvisitation and phone call policies unconstitutionally risk serious harm, alone or in \ncombination with other policies; (7) whether DWCC’s policies as to programming, \neducation,  reading  material,  radio  and  television,  and  crafts  are  constitutionally \nadequate; (8) whether DWCC disciplinary practices are unconstitutional; (9) whether \nDWCC’s mental health staff is constitutionally adequate;  (10) whether DWCC’s \nmental health diagnosis, monitoring and recordkeeping are constitutionally adequate; \n(11) whether DWCC’s punitive use of ‘suicide watch’ is constitutional; and (12) what \nrelief is required to ensure constitutional conditions of confinement for the class.  \n \nRecord Document 397 at 19–20 (footnote omitted).  \nPlaintiffs also seek to raise a First Amendment claim on behalf of the class. “Prisoners retain \nfree speech rights consistent ‘with the legitimate penological objectives of the corrections system,’ and \nrestrictions on those rights cannot be greater than necessary to protect the correctional interests \ninvolved.” Every v. Jindal, 413 F. App’x 725, 727 (5th Cir. 2011) (quoting Brewer v. Wilkinson, 3 F.3d 816, \n821–22 (5th Cir. 1993)). Plaintiffs allege that DWCC has a practice, in violation of its stated policy, of \nopening legal mail sent from attorneys to prisoners and from prisoners to attorneys. Record Document \n397 at 20. They support this contention by citing to official policies stating that “outgoing privileged \ncorrespondence  may  be  posted  sealed,  and  will  not  be  opened  and  inspected  without  express \nauthorization from the Warden.” Record Documents 397 at 20 and 397-13 at 9. They presented \nevidence that staff is aware of this policy and aware that the organizations involved in the instant suit \nare proper recipients of privileged correspondence. Record Documents 397 at 20 and 397-15 at 14–15. \nDespite this, Plaintiffs cite to evidence that mail sent by prisoners at DWCC to Disability Rights has \n12 \n \n \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 462   Filed 09/20/21   Page 13 of 28 PageID #: \n23241\nbeen opened before reaching that prisoner numerous times. Record Documents 397 at 21 and 397-16 \nat 2. They point to DWCC policies requiring that incoming legal mail be opened in front of the prisoner \nand that the prisoner sign a receipt that the mail has been received and contrast that with testimony \nfrom prisoners that they routinely receive mail that has already been opened outside their presence. \nRecord Documents 397 at 21, 397-19 at 2, and 397-20 at 10. Plaintiffs contend that this demonstrates \ntwo common questions: 1) whether DWCC’s policies related to mail are constitutional and 2) the \nappropriate remedy for any violations. Record Document 397 at 21. Defendants do not offer any \nspecific argument against commonality as to Plaintiffs’ First Amendment claim. See Record Documents \n131 at 12–14 and 407 at 13–19. Considering the lack of argument by Defendants and the evidence \nproduced by Plaintiffs, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have satisfied the commonality requirement as to \ntheir First Amendment claim.  \nDefendants raise several arguments against commonality as to Plaintiffs’ Eighth Amendment \nclaims. They point to Dr. John Thompson’s expert report explaining that inmates at DWCC have \nindividualized mental health needs requiring different treatments and interventions, to testimony from \nPlaintiffs’ expert Dr. Burns acknowledging that each inmate has different mental health needs, and to \nDisability Rights Louisiana’s deposition testimony admitting that each inmate’s mental health needs \nmust be considered individually to argue that claims related to mental health are not common because \nof their individualized nature. Record Documents 407 at 15–16, 407-1 at 16, and 407-8 at 216–17.6 \nDefendants contend that there can be no finding of a common question in this case because there is \nno “scientific proof that Plaintiffs’ hypothesis is actually true—that restrictive housing causes mental \n \n6 Defendants excerpted the relevant portion of Dr. Burns’s deposition testimony in their brief \nand direct the Court to Record Document 397-3. See Record Document 407 at 16, n.31. Record \nDocument 397-3 is Dr. Burns’s expert report, not her deposition testimony, and the Court did not \nindependently locate Dr. Burns’s deposition testimony in the record.  \n13 \n \n \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 462   Filed 09/20/21   Page 14 of 28 PageID #: \n23242\nillness in those without it and exacerbates mental illness in those with it.” Record Document 407 at 16. \nFinally, Defendants aver that the alleged injuries of the class are not the same and that the “answers to \nthese alleged harms are also not subject to uniform resolution.” Id. at 18. For example, they note that \n“[r]epeatedly violent offenders who create security concerns present a different penological case than \nthe offender who has had one major violation that has placed him in restrictive housing and is released \nafter serving the time for his infraction.” Id. at 18–19. \nThe Court concludes that the putative class has also satisfied the commonality requirement as \nto its Eighth Amendment claims. As summarized by another court, “in order to prove commonality, \nPlaintiffs must establish that there is a policy or practice on the part of the defendants that is the source \nof the putative class members[’] alleged injuries, and also that the claims arising out of those injuries \ndepends on common questions of law and fact.” Dockery, 253 F. Supp. 3d at 853. Plaintiffs have done \nso. As outlined above, Plaintiffs have shown that there are numerous policies and practices in place on \nextended lockdown at DWCC that are the alleged source of the putative class’s injuries. For example, \nthey have established via expert testimony that exposing inmates to social isolation, forced idleness, \nand an indefinite time period being held in extended lockdown poses a substantial risk of serious harm. \nFurther, they have shown that the claims of the putative class will arise out of common questions of \nlaw and fact. For example, whether the policies that Plaintiffs describe as social isolation, forced \nidleness, and indefinite time on extended lockdown in fact do create a substantial risk of serious harm \nto inmates’ mental health and, if so, whether DWCC staff was aware of and deliberately indifferent to \nthis risk both arise from common facts and common questions of law.  \nThe Court will briefly address why it is not persuaded by the arguments Defendants raise in \nopposition to commonality. Contrary to Defendants’ assertion, differences in the individual mental \nhealth needs are immaterial to this case because Plaintiffs seek to challenge the overall systems and \n14 \n \n \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 462   Filed 09/20/21   Page 15 of 28 PageID #: \n23243\npolicies in place. They do not contend that the treatment provided to an individual prisoner has exposed \nhim to a substantial risk of harm, but rather, that all inmates are exposed to a substantial risk of harm \ndue to the policies and practices in place on extended lockdown at DWCC. Other courts have reached \na similar conclusion. See, e.g., Dockery, 253 F. Supp. 3d at 854; Braggs v. Dunn, 317 F.R.D. 634, 656–57 \n(M.D. Ala. 2016). \nDefendants’ argument that commonality is not satisfied because prisoners face different injuries \nand have different resolutions is unpersuasive. As other courts have held when faced with arguments \nregarding the dissimilarity of injuries in the prisoner litigation context, “Plaintiffs need only show that \nDefendants’ actions ‘were ineffective to reduce the risk of serious harm to a constitutionally permissible \nlevel for any inmate.’” Valentine v. Collier, No. 4:20-CV-1115, 2020 WL 3491999, at *10 (S.D. Tex. June \n27, 2020) (quoting Yates v. Collier, 868 F.3d 354, 363 (5th Cir. 2017)) (emphasis in original). Like in \nLewis, Defendants’ argument “fail[s] to negate the injury at the center of the [putative class’s] claims: \nthe exposure to an unreasonable risk of serious harm.” Lewis, 324 F.R.D. at 170–71. While inmates will \nlikely have different exposure to that risk of serious harm, it does not destroy commonality. Id.  \nFinally, the alleged lack of scientific proof regarding Plaintiffs’ hypothesis that restrictive \nhousing causes or exacerbates mental illness does not lead to a conclusion that there are no common \nquestions. In fact, the opposite is true. The hypothesis as framed by Defendants is the core common \nquestion for resolution at the center of this case. If Defendants and their experts are vindicated in their \nposition that Plaintiffs cannot establish that the conditions on extended lockdown at DWCC pose a \nsubstantial risk of causing or exacerbating mental illness, then the entire putative class’s claims are \ndefeated. This is therefore the exact type of common contention that will generate a common answer \nlikely to resolve the claims of the putative class at once. In re Deepwater Horizon, 739 F.3d at 811. The \nputative class has satisfied the commonality requirement.  \n15 \n \n \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 462   Filed 09/20/21   Page 16 of 28 PageID #: \n23244\n2.  The Subclass \nPlaintiffs seek to pursue claims that DWCC has violated the ADA and RA on behalf of the \nputative subclass. Record Document 316 ¶s 295–309. Again, Plaintiffs request injunctive relief, not \nmoney damages. The ADA provides that “no qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of \nsuch disability, be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services, programs, \nor activities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any such entity.” 42 U.S.C. § 12132. \nIt defines a person with a disability as “a person who has a physical or mental impairment that \nsubstantially limits one or more major life activity.” 42 U.S.C. § 12102(1)(A); 28 C.F.R. § 36.105. This \nincludes individuals with historical, but not present, impairments and those who are regarded as having \nan impairment regardless of actual disability. 42 U.S.C. § 12102(1)(B)–(C). \nThe RA states that “[n]o otherwise qualified individual with a disability . . . shall solely by reason \nof his disability . . . be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal \nfinancial assistance.” 29 U.S.C. § 794(a). It defines disability in the same way as the ADA. Kemp v. Holder, \n610 F.3d 231, 234 (5th Cir. 2010). “The RA and the ADA are judged under the same legal standards, \nand the same remedies are available under both Acts.” Id. (citations omitted).  \nTo prevail on ADA claims, a plaintiff must prove “(1) that he has a qualifying disability; (2) that \nhe is being denied the benefits of services, programs, or activities for which the public entity is \nresponsible, or is otherwise discriminated against by the public entity; and (3) that such discrimination \nis by reason of his disability.” Hale v. King, 642 F.3d 492, 499 (5th Cir. 2011). The elements of a claim \nunder the RA are the same, except that the entity in question must be one which receives federal \nfinancial assistance. See Kemp, 610 F.3d at 234. Particularly relevant to this case, the ADA recognizes a \n“methods of administration” claim that prohibits public entities from using “criteria or methods of \n16 \n \n \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 462   Filed 09/20/21   Page 17 of 28 PageID #: \n23245\nadministration  .  .  .  [that]  have  the  effect  of  subjecting  qualified  individuals  with  disabilities  to \ndiscrimination on the basis of disability.” 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(3); see Dunn, 318 F.R.D. at 664.  \n  Plaintiffs have established, and Defendants do not dispute, that the ADA and RA apply to \nDWCC. Pa. Dep’t of Corr. v. Yeskey, 524 U.S. 206, 209–10 (1998); Proposed Budget for the State of \nLouisiana  for  Fiscal  Year  2020-2021  at  57, \nhttps://www.doa.la.gov/media/ia5hbtb5/fy21_proposedbudget.pdf. Whether the putative subclass \nhas established that it has in common a mental disability as defined by the ADA and RA and whether \nthe putative subclass was discriminated against because of their disabilities is in dispute. Record \nDocuments 393 at 23 and 507 at 26–27. \n  Plaintiffs maintain that the putative subclass has satisfied the first element of their claim because \n“[a] mental health disability is a mental impairment that ‘substantially limits one or more major life \nactivities.’” Record Document 397 at 23 (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 12102). Defendants argue that this is \ninsufficient because Plaintiffs have failed to “identify which life activity or activities are limited by their \nproposed class, or how the class is represented by these named plaintiffs.” Record Document 407 at \n26. In response, Plaintiffs presented evidence regarding the diagnosed SMI of each Named Plaintiff \nand how these diagnoses interfere with major life activities. Record Document 412 at 11. They explain: \nLarry Jones has been diagnosed with major depressive disorder, requiring medication. \nR. Doc. 397-22. Ronald Brooks has been diagnosed with depressive episodes with \npsychotic features and PTSD, and requires medication to prevent hallucinations. R. \nDoc. 397-23. Carlton Turner has been diagnosed with major depressive disorder and \nharmed himself in 2010. R. Doc. 397-24. Bruce Charles has been diagnosed with \nbipolar disorder and harmed himself in 2016. R. Doc. 397-25. These diagnoses are all \nacknowledged  by  Defendants  as  serious  mental  illness,  and  squarely  meet  the \nstandards for disability under the ADA. \nId.  \n  The Court finds that this is sufficient to satisfy the first element of the putative subclass’s claim. \nPlaintiffs have adequately alleged that the Named Plaintiffs have a disability as defined by the ADA \n17 \n \n \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 462   Filed 09/20/21   Page 18 of 28 PageID #: \n23246\nand the subclass is defined in such a way that it only includes those who likewise have qualifying \ndisabilities under the ADA.  \n  The remaining issue is whether Plaintiffs have presented evidence raising common questions \nof fact or law regarding whether the putative subclass has been discriminated against because of its \ndisability. Plaintiffs attempt to satisfy this requirement by identifying policies and practices which they \nallege “place prisoners with mental health disabilities at heightened and discriminatory risk of serious \nharm because of their disabilities.” Record Document 397 at 23. They cite Dr. Haney’s expert opinion \nthat mentally ill prisoners are especially vulnerable to the conditions of extended lockdown because \nthey are “generally more sensitive and reactive to psychological stressors and emotional pain.” Record \nDocuments 397 at 23 and 397-2 at 33–34. Dr. Haney explains that, for this reason, many corrections \nofficials have limited the use of solitary confinement for those with mental illness. Record Document \n397-2 at 36.  \nAt DWCC, however, inmates with diagnosed SMI are subject to the same conditions as all \nother inmates on the South Compound. Id. at 52. That DWCC does not limit the use of extended \nlockdown for these inmates or consider these inmates’ mental health when placing them on extended \nlockdown, Plaintiffs allege, is a failure to make a reasonable accommodation as required by 28 C.F.R. \n§ 35.130(b)(7). Record Document 397 at 24. Plaintiffs presented evidence that DWCC fails to make \nreasonable accommodations in other ways as well. These include failing to modify existing mental \nhealth programming or counseling services to allow subclass members to  participate and using \nexcessive force on inmates with a diagnosed SMI without regard to its impact on that inmate. Record \nDocuments 397 at 24, 397-2 at 49–57, 397-3 at 19–20, and 393-4 at 38–40.  \nPlaintiffs next contend that the aforementioned inadequacies of the mental health care system \nat DWCC applies to the subclass, particularly because for these inmates, the alleged inability to diagnose \n18 \n \n \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 462   Filed 09/20/21   Page 19 of 28 PageID #: \n23247\nand treat mental illness exacerbates the underlying mental illness. Record Document 397 at 25. They \nalso present evidence that DWCC has a policy of punishing those who seek mental health care and \nargue that this is discriminatory toward the putative subclass because it is those who already have mental \nillness who will most often seek care for that condition and be “punished for expressing their needs.” \nId.  \nBased on the above, Plaintiffs have identified numerous common questions relative to the \nsubclass: \n(1)  whether  DWCC’s  policies  discriminate  against  prisoners  with  mental  health \ndisabilities; (2) whether the discriminatory  effect of these policies is because  of \nprisoners’ disabilities within the meaning of the statute; (3) whether placement of \nprisoners with mental health disabilities on extended lockdown is discriminatory; (4) \nwhether DWCC’s failure to identify and make reasonable modifications to policies to \naccommodate  prisoners’  mental  illness  is  discriminatory;  (5)  whether  DWCC’s \ninadequate  mental  health  system  is  discriminatory;  and  (6)  whether  DWCC’s \npunishment of prisoners who seek mental health care is discriminatory. \n \nRecord Document 397 at 25.  \n \nDefendants argue that Plaintiffs have failed to show that there are common questions as to the \nsubclass because Plaintiffs have not alleged that they have been discriminated against because of their \ndisability. Record Document 407 at 27. For example, they note that Plaintiffs allege that all inmates in \nthe South Compound are treated the same and do not allege that disabled inmates are treated differently \nbecause  of  their  disability.  Id.  These  arguments  are  not  persuasive  and seem  to  fundamentally \nmisunderstand the claims of the putative subclass—it is DWCC’s failure to treat inmates with mental \nillness in a way that accommodates the mental illness that Plaintiffs allege is discriminatory. See also \nYates, 868 F.3d at 366 (finding no error in a district court certifying a class to pursue ADA claims based \non the alleged failure to provide reasonable accommodations to inmates with disabilities that could \nmake them more susceptible to heat than other inmates). \n19 \n \n \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 462   Filed 09/20/21   Page 20 of 28 PageID #: \n23248\nThe Court finds that Plaintiffs have met the commonality requirement for the putative subclass. \nAs listed above, there are numerous common questions of fact and law and the resolution of those \nquestions will be determinative of the claims of the subclass as a whole. For example, if it is shown that \nit is not discriminatory for DWCC not to modify its policies to accommodate prisoners’ mental illness, \nit will resolve all Plaintiffs’ claims at once. The putative subclass has therefore satisfied the commonality \nrequirement of Rule 23(a). \nD.  Typicality \nThe  third  prerequisite  contained  in  Rule  23(a)  is  that  “the  claims  or  defenses  of  the \nrepresentative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(3). Other \ncourts have described the typicality requirement as “commonality addressed from the perspective of \nthe named plaintiffs. Commonality requires showing that, in fact, all members of the proposed class \nshare a common claim. . . . Typicality requires showing that, in fact, the proposed representatives have \nthat claim.” Lewis, 324 F.R.D. at 169 (quoting M.D. v. Perry, 294 F.R.D. 7, 29 (S.D. Tex. 2013)). This \ndoes not require a showing that all claims are identical, however. Id. Instead, the class representative’s \nclaims must ‘“arise from the same event or pattern or practice and [be] based on the same legal theory’ \nas the class claims.” Dunn, 318 F.R.D. at 666 (quoting Williams v. Mohawk Indus., Inc., 568 F.3d 1350, \n1357 (11th Cir. 2009)). Typicality is not as concerned with the “strengths of the named and unnamed \nplaintiffs’ cases” as it is with the “similarity of legal and remedial theories behind their claims.” Ward v. \nHellerstedt, 753 F. App’x 236, 247 (5th Cir. 2018) (citing Ibe, 836 F.3d at 528–29). \n  Plaintiffs seek injunctive relief, not money damages. Plaintiffs assert that each Named Plaintiff \nsatisfies the typicality requirement to represent both the class and the subclass because each was housed \nin extended lockdown at DWCC between 2016 and the Court’s ruling regarding standing in this matter \nand because each named Plaintiff has a diagnosed SMI. Record Document 397 at 27. They, therefore, \n20 \n \n \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 462   Filed 09/20/21   Page 21 of 28 PageID #: \n23249\nreason that each Named Plaintiff was subject to the substantial risks of serious harm from the policies \nin place for inmates on extended lockdown, that these policies applied equally to the Named Plaintiffs \nas to the class and subclass as a whole, and that the Named Plaintiffs and the class and subclass share \nthe same legal theories.  \n  Defendants argue that Plaintiffs have failed to carry their burden because none of the Named \nPlaintiffs remain at DWCC.7 Record Document 407 at 21. They further argue that the Named Plaintiffs \nhave failed to show that their claims are typical of the class at large because they have not shown that \nthe time spent in restrictive housing was typical, that their level of care was typical, or that their injuries \nwere typical. Id. at 22. Finally, they contend that the Named Plaintiffs’ claims are not typical of the \nsubclass because they have not shown that they have a qualifying disability under the ADA.8 Id. \n  The Named Plaintiffs have satisfied the typicality requirement as to the class and subclass. The \nfact that the men are no longer at DWCC does not mean that their claims are atypical of the inmates \nwho remain incarcerated there. Their claims still arise from the same events and policies as the class \nand subclass and are premised on the same legal theories. That they are no longer at DWCC relates \nmore to whether the men have standing, an issue which this Court has already addressed in Record \nDocument 315, and to the adequacy of their representation, which the Court will address below.  \nEach of the Named Plaintiffs’ claims are typical to that of the class and subclass in that they \nwere inmates housed on extended lockdown at DWCC and subjected to the policies and practices now \nat issue. Any differences identified by Defendants between the Named Plaintiffs and the class and \nsubclass are immaterial because the claims of each putative class and subclass member arise from the \nsame policies and practices and are based on the same legal theories, not the facts as applied to a \n \n7 Bruce Charles has been released from custody, Carlton Turner is now housed at Louisiana \nState Penitentiary, and Larry Jones and Ronald Brooks are housed at Elayn Hunt Correctional Center.  \n8 The Court has previously addressed this issue and thus does not address it again here.  \n21 \n \n \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 462   Filed 09/20/21   Page 22 of 28 PageID #: \n23250\nparticular inmate. The claims thus have the same characteristics, and the Named Plaintiffs meet the \ntypicality requirement for the class and subclass. Dockery, 253 F. Supp. 3d at 855.  \nE.  Adequacy \nRule 23(a)’s final prerequisite is the requirement that “the representative parties will fairly and \nadequately protect the interests of the class.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(4). A key function of the adequacy \ninquiry is to “uncover conflicts of interest between named parties and the class they seek to represent.” \nAmchem Prods., Inc., v. Windsor, 521 U.S. 591, 625 (1997). The Fifth Circuit has held that: \nAdequacy  encompasses  three  separate  but  related  inquiries  (1)  ‘the  zeal  and \ncompetence of the representative[s’] counsel’; (2) ‘the [willingness] and ability of the \nrepresentative[s] to take an active role in and control the litigation and to protect the \ninterests of absentees’; and (3) the risk of ‘conflicts of interest between the named \nplaintiffs and the class they seek to represent.’  \n \nSlade v. Progressive Sec. Ins. Co., 856 F.3d 408, 412 (5th Cir. 2017) (quoting Feder v. Elec. Data Sys. Corp., \n429 F.3d 125, 130 (5th Cir. 2005)). \n  Defendants argue that the Named Plaintiffs have failed to satisfy the adequacy requirement \nbecause they are no longer housed at DWCC. Record Document 407 at 21. They aver that the Named \nPlaintiffs’ claims will conflict with the “desires of offenders housed in general population at DWCC.” \nId. Defendants suggest that, because the putative class and subclass seek to include offenders who may \nin the future be housed in extended lockdown, the class must also take into account the interests of \nthose offenders currently housed in general population at DWCC. Id. at 21–22.  They note that putative \nclass counsel works for Disability Rights, who is also a Named Plaintiff in this matter and stands to \nbenefit financially from this matter while the putative class and subclass do not. Id. at 22.  \n  The Named Plaintiffs satisfy the adequacy requirement. The Named Plaintiffs’ counsel has \nzealously and competently represented the Named Plaintiffs in this matter, as evidenced by the “volume \nand thoroughness of the pleadings” filed to date. Dockery, 253 F. Supp. 3d at 855. While it is true that \n22 \n \n \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 462   Filed 09/20/21   Page 23 of 28 PageID #: \n23251\nseveral lawyers enrolled to represent the Named Plaintiffs work for and also represent Disability Rights \nLouisiana, this is not a hinderance in their ability to effectively represent the putative class and subclass. \nIn fact, it is not uncommon for lawyers from organizations with associational standing to represent \nboth the organization and the plaintiffs in the same litigation. Cunningham v. Fed. Bureau of Prisons, 222 \nF. Supp. 3d 959, 960 (D. Colo. 2015); Braggs, 317 F.R.D. at 639; Indiana Prot. & Advoc. Servs. Comm’n v. \nIndiana Dep’t of Corr., No. 1:08- CV-01317, 2012 WL 6738517 (S.D. Ind. Dec. 31, 2012). \n  The Court has also been presented with no evidence to contradict Plaintiffs’ counsel’s assertion \nthat the Named Plaintiffs in this matter remain committed to taking an active role in the litigation and \nto protecting the interests of absentees. Record Document 397 at 28. Counsel reports that even after \nbeing moved from DWCC, the Named Plaintiffs have “maintained close contact with their attorneys \nand fully participated in the conduct of the litigation.” Id.  \n  Finally, the Court does not find that there is a conflict of interest between the Named Plaintiffs \nand the class they seek to represent. Defendants seemingly base their conflict argument on the theory \nthat, because the putative class and subclass include inmates who may in the future be held in extended \nlockdown, the class and subclass include some inmates currently housed in general population at \nDWCC. From this, they reason that it is a conflict of interest for those currently housed in extended \nlockdown to represent the interests of those in general population who may in the future be housed in \nextended lockdown because the class and subclass seek to change policies “that have clearly worked at \n[DWCC], to the benefit of the general population offenders.” Record Document 407 at 22. This logic \nis flawed. If the inmates currently in general population are members of the class or subclass, it is \nbecause they will in the future be removed from general population and housed in extended lockdown. \nTherefore, their interests as a member of the class or subclass is not in the conditions of general \npopulation, but rather in the policies and procedures they would be subjected to while housed in \n23 \n \n \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 462   Filed 09/20/21   Page 24 of 28 PageID #: \n23252\nextended lockdown. Further, the Court does not find that the constitutionally adequate treatment of \none prisoner is a conflict with another prisoner. \n  In sum, the Named Plaintiffs in this matter have satisfied the adequacy requirement of Rule \n23(a). Having concluded that Plaintiffs have satisfied the prerequisites of Rule 23(a) for both the class \nand subclass, the Court now turns to whether Plaintiffs have met the requirements of Rule 23(b). \nF.  Rule 23(b)(2) \nPlaintiffs seek certification as a Rule 23(b)(2) class. A Rule 23(b)(2) class is appropriate where \n“the party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class, \nso that final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a \nwhole.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2). This analysis is focused on whether there are common behaviors by a \ndefendant toward a class and not focused on whether there are common issues to be determined. Yates, \n868 F.3d at 366. The Fifth Circuit has interpreted this language to have two requirements. First, the \n“class members must have been harmed in essentially the same way.” Perry, 675 F.3d at 845 (quoting \nMaldonado v. Ochsner Clinic Found., 493 F.3d 521, 524 (5th Cir. 2007)). Second, “the injunctive relief \nsought must be specific.” Id. (quoting Maldonado, 394 F.3d at 524). Supreme Court precedent holds that \na Rule 23(b)(2) class is only appropriate “when a single injunction or declaratory judgment would \nprovide relief to each member of the class. It does not authorize class certification when each individual \nclass  member  would  be  entitled  to  a  different  injunction  or  declaratory  judgment  against  the \ndefendant.” Id. (quoting Wal-Mart, 564 U.S. at 360).  \nPlaintiffs argue that they have satisfied the requirements of Rule 23(b)(2) as to the class and \nsubclass because they seek a declaration that the policies and practices detailed above violate the Eighth \nAmendment, First Amendment, ADA, and RA. Record Document 397 at 30. They identify the \nfollowing as the contents of injunctive relief sought by the class and subclass: \n24 \n \n \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 462   Filed 09/20/21   Page 25 of 28 PageID #: \n23253\n•  Limit the use of solitary confinement to cases and durations which are \nabsolutely necessary to protect the health and safety of others; \n \n•  Divert prisoners with mental health disabilities to secure treatment facilities; \n \n•  Require that prisoners who must be in solitary confinement be allowed \nadequate out of cell time per day, including a mix of recreational activities and \nstructured programming opportunities; \n \n•  Require that prisoners be permitted access to rehabilitative programming, \nradio  and  television  entertainment,  regular and scheduled  visitation  and \nphone call privileges, and other quality-of-life minima; \n \n•  Eliminate barbaric and outdated correctional practices that strip people of \ntheir clothing, property, and mattress; \n \n•  Require that DWCC hire and train sufficient qualified mental health staff to \nconduct its mental health services so as to appropriately identify, prevent, and \ntreat prisoners’ mental health challenges; \n \n•  Require an overhaul of the system for documenting and providing mental \nhealth medications; and \n \n•  Prohibit punishing prisoners for seeking mental health care or manifesting \nsymptoms of mental illness, and require suicide watch policies and practices \nthat protect prisoners rather than punishing them, including the use of suicide \nprevention garments that cover the body and afford prisoners dignity and \nprivacy, and use of suicide-resistant mattresses rather than bare concrete for \nsleeping. \n \nId.  \n  Defendants contend that Plaintiffs have failed to satisfy Rule 23(b)(2) because the class \nmembers have not been harmed in essentially the same way. Record Document 407 at 24. They note \nthat the injunctive relief “does not even consider putative class members not currently in restrictive \nhousing.” Id. They argue that Plaintiffs’ outline of injunctive relief sought is impermissibly vague. Id. \nFor example, Plaintiffs seek to require DWCC to have “qualified mental health staff” to “appropriately \nidentify, prevent, and treat” inmates. Id. at 24–25. \n  Plaintiffs have satisfied the requirement that they be harmed in essentially the same way. Like \nother prisoner litigation cases, Plaintiffs seek to challenge policies and procedures that are broadly \n25 \n \n \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 462   Filed 09/20/21   Page 26 of 28 PageID #: \n23254\napplicable to the class and subclass. Ward, 753 F. App’x at 249 (“[T]his court has found purported class \nmembers to have been ‘harmed in essentially the same way’ where they have each been subject to the \nsame allegedly wrongful policy, despite variations in the degree of damages suffered by each.”) (citing \nYates, 868 F.3d at 367–68); Braggs, 317 F.R.D. at 667 (“The Supreme Court has approved of system-\nwide relief in prison cases involving ‘systemwide violation[s]’ resulting from ‘systemwide deficiencies.’”) \n(quoting Brown v. Plata, 563 U.S. 493, 532 (2011)). Because the putative class and subclass seek to \nchallenge policies, “any injunction ordered by the Court would provide relief to each member of the \nclass” and subclass. Dockery, 253 F. Supp. 3d at 855.  \n  Plaintiffs have also satisfied the specificity requirement. The specificity requirement “does not \nrequire that every jot and tittle of injunctive relief be spelled out at the class certification stage; it requires \nonly ‘reasonable detail’ as to the ‘acts required.’” Yates, 868 F.3d at 368 (quoting Perry, 675 F.3d at 848). \nPlaintiffs “must be able to explain ‘how a court could define or enforce meaningful injunctive relief.’” \nWard, 753 F. App’x at 249 (quoting Maldonado, 493 F.3d at 525). The Fifth Circuit has previously opined \nthat “to comply with Rule 23(b)(2), Plaintiffs will, at minimum, have to describe in some kind of detail \nfrom what actions or inactions Defendant should be restrained. A general request that Defendant be \nrestrained from violating Plaintiffs’ Fourteenth Amendment protections is insufficient.” Id. Here, \nPlaintiffs have identified numerous policies that they seek to change in reasonable detail to show how \nthe Court could define or enforce meaningful injunctive relief. While they have not fully spelled out \nthe precise injunctive relief they seek, they have provided the core of the relief they seek. The precise \ndetails of each element of injunctive relief will be determined at trial and after taking into account the \ncurrent policies and practices in place at DWCC.  \n  The Court, therefore, concludes that Plaintiffs have established the requirements to certify a \nclass under Rule 23(b)(2). Because Plaintiffs have met the requirements of Rule 23(a) and Rule 23(b)(2), \n26 \n \n \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 462   Filed 09/20/21   Page 27 of 28 PageID #: \n23255\nthe Court certifies Plaintiffs’ class of all prisoners who are or will be subjected to extended lockdown \nat David Wade Correctional Center and a subclass consisting of all individuals on extended lockdown \nat David Wade Correctional Center who have or are perceived as having a qualifying disability related \nto mental health, as defined within the Americans with Disabilities Act.  \nG.  Class Counsel \nRule 23(g) requires a court that certifies a class to appoint class counsel. In appointing class \ncounsel, a court must consider:  \n(i) the work counsel has done in identifying or investigating potential claims \nin the action; \n \n(ii) counsel’s experience in handling class actions, other complex litigation, \nand the types of claims asserted in the action; \n \n(iii) counsel’s knowledge of the applicable law; and \n \n(iv) the resources that counsel will commit to representing the class. \n \nFed R. Civ. P. 23(g)(1)(A). A court may also consider “any other matter pertinent to counsel’s ability \nto fairly and adequately represent the interests of the class.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(g)(1)(B).  \n  In this case, all factors favor appointing Plaintiffs’ current counsel as class counsel. Counsel has \nalready devoted significant time and effort to investigating and pursuing potential claims in this matter, \nthey are experienced in handling litigation of this type, have knowledge of the applicable law through \ntheir prior litigation experience, and have demonstrated that they will dedicate sufficient resources to \nrepresenting the class. Record Document 397-29. Accordingly, the Court appoints the counsel for the \nNamed Plaintiffs as class counsel.  \nIII.  Conclusion \n \nFor the reasons stated herein, Plaintiffs’ motion to certify a class and subclass [Record \nDocument 2] is GRANTED. The Court certifies a class of all prisoners who are or will be subjected \n27 \n \n \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 462   Filed 09/20/21   Page 28 of 28 PageID #: \n23256\nto extended lockdown at David Wade Correctional Center and a subclass consisting of all individuals \non extended lockdown at David Wade Correctional Center who have or are perceived as having a \nqualifying disability related to mental health, as defined within the Americans with Disabilities Act.  \nTHUS DONE AND SIGNED this _20th____ day of September, 2021. \nELIZABETH ERNY FOOTE \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE \n28 ",

DEFENDANTS ARE NOT IN VIOLATION OF THE EIGHTH AMENDMENT’S \nVERY HIGH BAR PROHIBITING CRUEL AND UNUSUAL PUNISHMENT. \n \nDEFENSE 1: Plaintiffs cannot carry the high burden of establishing a violation of the \nEighth Amendment. \n \n1.  “Prison officials [may] violate the Eighth Amendment when they demonstrate \ndeliberate indifference to a prisoner’s serious medical needs . . . .” Brewster v. Dretke, 587 F.3d \n764, 769 (5th Cir. 2009) (citing Wilson v. Seiter, 501 U.S. 294, 297 (1991)).  “Deliberate \nindifference is an ‘extremely high’ standard to meet.” Id. at 770; see also Domino v. Tex. Dep’t of \nCrim. Justice, 239 F.3d 752, 756 (5th Cir. 2001).  \n2.  “Deliberate indifference ‘is a stringent standard of fault, requiring proof that a \nmunicipal [or state] actor disregarded a known or obvious consequence of his [, her, or its] action.’” \nShadrick v. Hopkins Cty., 805 F.3d 724, 737 (6th Cir. 2015) (quoting Bd. of Cty. Comm’rs of Bryan \nCty., Okla. v. Brown, 520 U.S. 397, 410 (1997)).  \n3.  Only “unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain” is proscribed by the Eighth \nAmendment. Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 103 (1976).  “Deliberate indifference is an extremely \nhigh standard to meet.” Cadena v. El Paso Cty., 946 F.3d 717, 728 (5th Cir. 2020); Valentine v. \nCollier, 956 F.3d 797, 801 (5th Cir. 2020), cert. denied, 140 S. Ct. 1598 (2020). \n4.  “Deliberate indifference is an ‘extremely high’ standard to meet.” Brewster, 587 \nF.3d at 769 (citing Wilson, 501 U.S. at 297); see also Domino, 239 F.3d at 756; Cadena, 946 F.3d \nat 728; Valentine, 956 F.3d at 801. \n5.  The Fifth Circuit in Valentine explained that: To satisfy the objective requirement, \nthe plaintiff must show an “objectively intolerable risk of harm.” [Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. \n825, 846 (1994).]  To satisfy the subjective requirement, the plaintiff must show that the defendant: \n“(1) was ‘aware of facts from which the inference could be drawn that a substantial risk of serious \n5 \n62639725.v1 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 514   Filed 01/05/22   Page 6 of 40 PageID #:  24266\nharm exists’; (2) subjectively ‘dr[e]w the inference’ that the risk existed; and (3) disregarded the \nrisk.” 956 F.3d at 801 (quoting Cleveland v. Bell, 938 F.3d 672, 676 (5th Cir. 2019) (quoting \nFarmer, 511 U.S. at 837)).  \n6.  The Supreme Court has also held that in cases in which inmates seek injunctive \nrelief to prevent substantial risks of serious injury from ripening into actual harm, the Eighth \nAmendment deliberate  indifference  standard  “should  be  determined  in  light  of  the  prison \nauthorities’ current attitudes and conduct,” i.e. “their attitudes and conduct at the time suit is \nbrought and persisting thereafter.” Farmer, 511 U.S. at 827. \n7.  Further,  a  prisoner  seeking  injunctive  relief  on  the  grounds  that  there  is  “a \ncontemporary violation of a nature likely to continue,” must show both the existence of a violation \nand produce evidence “from which it can be inferred that the [prison] officials were at the time \nsuit was filed . . . knowingly and unreasonably disregarding an objectively intolerable risk of harm, \nand that they will continue to do so . . . during the remainder of the litigation and into the \nfuture.” Farmer, 511 U.S. at 846.1  \n8.  Only “extreme deprivation” of one or more of the “minimal civilized measures \nof life’s necessities” arise to a violation of the Eighth Amendment. Davis v. Scott, 157 F.3d \n1003, 1006 (5th Cir. 1998) (quoting Wilson, 501 U.S. at 304). \n9.  “Overall conditions” do not rise to the level of cruel and unusual punishment \nwhen no specific deprivation of a single human need exists.  In Dockery v. Cain, 7 F.4th 375, \n378 (5th Cir. 2021), the plaintiffs argued that the district court erred by considering the \nchallenged conditions in isolation instead of in combination.  The Fifth Circuit found that the \n                                                 \n1 Defendants maintain their objection that they should be allowed to present evidence of current conditions, including \npolicy changes and hiring additional staff.  The Supreme Court in Farmer clearly instructed in a suit for an injunction \nthat “prisoner[s] may rely on developments that postdate the pleadings and pretrial motions, as [defendants] may rely \non such developments to show that the prisoner is not entitled to an injunction.” 511 U.S. at 827. \n6 \n62639725.v1 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 514   Filed 01/05/22   Page 7 of 40 PageID #:  24267\nargument was foreclosed by Wilson (501 U.S. at 305), which explained, “[n]othing so \namorphous as ‘overall conditions’ can rise to the level of cruel and unusual punishment when \nno specific deprivation of a single human need exists.” Id.  \n10.  “Prison officials [may] violate the Eighth Amendment when they demonstrate \ndeliberate indifference to a prisoner’s serious medical needs . . . .” Brewster, 587 F.3d at 769 (citing \nWilson, 501 U.S. at 297). \n11.   As  the  Fifth  Circuit  and  a  sister  court  in  this  circuit  have  noted,  “[t]he \nConstitution . . . ‘does not require that prisoners, as individuals or groups, be provided with \nany amenity which some person may think is needed to avoid mental, physical, and emotional \ndeterioration.’” Dockery v. Hall, 443 F. Supp. 3d 726, 748 (S.D. Miss. 2019) (citing Newman \nv. State of Al., 559 F.2d 283, 291 (5th Cir. 1977)). \n12.  Evidence of Plaintiffs’ failure to carry their high burden of proof will consist of \nall evidence at trial. \nDEFENSE  2  –  Restrictive  Housing  does  not  present  an  objectively  intolerable \nunreasonable risk of harm. \n \n13.  Defendants’ expert, Dr. Thompson will testify that the issue of whether restrictive \nhousing causes or contributes to mental illness is unsettled.  He will testify regarding what is \nknown as the Colorado Study.  The Colorado Study was undertaken with the goal of proving the \nhypothesis that restrictive housing causes or aggravates mental illness.  At the end of the one-year \nstudy, to the surprise of the researchers, offenders in restrictive housing actually showed slightly \nless mental illness.  The Colorado Study actually refuted the very premise sought to be proven. \n14.  Dr. Thompson will further testify regarding two meta-analyses undertaken.  A \nmeta-analysis surveys and summarizes the literature.  As with the Colorado Study, the meta-\nanalyses also failed to prove the hypothesis that restrictive housing causes or aggravates mental \n7 \n62639725.v1 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 514   Filed 01/05/22   Page 8 of 40 PageID #:  24268\nillness. \n15.   Dr. Thompson will further explain the error of the thinking of Plaintiffs’ expert, Dr. \nCraig Haney.  Dr. Haney conflates anecdotal and small-scale studies and draws conclusions \ntherefrom that cannot be supported.  In this area of science, it is important to compare similar \nstudies.  One study that addresses isolation on individuals with serious mental illness that would \nqualify as a LOC 1 or a LOC 2 under DPS&C’s guidelines has little relevance to what is happening \nat DWCC.  Further, a study of very draconian conditions, as in prisoner of war camps, have no \nrelevance to conditions at a modern prison such as DWCC. \n  16.  There is no objective risk of serious harm from housing offenders who either have \nno mental illness or whose mental illness is stable or in remission in an open bar cell in a modern \nprison setting.  \n   17.  Without an objective risk of serious harm, Plaintiffs’ claims must fail.  \nDEFENSE 3 – Restrictive Housing is a necessary penological practice and is not per \nse cruel and unusual punishment. \n \n18.  The Fifth Circuit has held that solitary confinement/restrictive housing is not per se \ncruel and unusual punishment. Novak v. Beto, 453 F.2d 661, 665 (5th Cir. 1971); Gates v. Collier, \n501 F.2d 1291, 1304 (5th Cir. 1974); LaVergne v. McDonald, No. 19-709, 2020 WL 7090064, at \n*13 (M.D. La. Mar. 23, 2020). \n19.  Solitary confinement serves a legitimate purpose in the prison community as a \ndeterrent and a punitive force. Novak, 453 F.2d at 670.  The Eighth Amendment imposes a duty \nupon prison officials to protect prisoners from violence at the hand of other prisoners. Farmer, 511 \nU.S. at 831-32; see also Wilson, 501 U.S. at 303; Rhodes v. Chapman, 452 U.S. 337, 347-48 \n(1981).  \n8 \n62639725.v1 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 514   Filed 01/05/22   Page 9 of 40 PageID #:  24269\n20.  The Fifth Circuit also recognized the paramount concern of security in corrections, \nstating: \nIt is beyond dispute, of course, that order must be maintained in the prisons. And \nwhen a prisoner continues to break prison rules even after losing such privileges as \ngoing to the movies and being assigned extra work, the authorities must have some \nharsher measure to induce compliance with prison regulations.  \n \nNovak, 453 F.2d at 670. \n21.  Prison officials are accorded the widest possible deference in the application of \npolicies and practices designed to maintain security and preserve internal order. See Berry v. \nBrady, 192 F.3d 504, 508 (5th Cir. 1999); Tasby v. Cain, No. 16-0277, 2017 WL 4295441, at *7 \n(M.D. La. Sept. 12, 2017), report and recommendation adopted, 2017 WL 4322413 (M.D. La. \nSept. 28, 2017). \n22.  The classification of inmates is a matter left to the broad general discretion of prison \nofficials, and a failure to refer an inmate plaintiff for additional treatment, diagnostic testing, or \nevaluation is a matter of professional medical judgment that the courts will not normally second-\nguess in the context of a claim of deliberate medical indifference. Tasby, 2017 WL 4295441, at \n*9; Cuellar v. Livingston, 321 F. App’x 373, 374 (5th Cir. 2009) (upholding the dismissal of an \ninmate’s claim as frivolous where he complained of a failure to refer him to a specialist, noting \nthat “the question whether ‘additional diagnostic techniques or forms of treatment is indicated is a \nclassic example of a matter for medical judgment’”). \n23.  The Supreme Court has repeatedly warned that “it is ‘difficult to imagine an activity \nin which a State has a stronger interest, or one that is more intricately bound up with state laws, \nregulations, and procedures, than the administration of its prisons.’” Woodford v. Ngo, 548 U.S. \n81, 94 (2006) (quoting Preiser v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 475, 491-92 (1973)); see also Mo. v. Jenkins, \n495 U.S. 33, 51 (1990). \n9 \n62639725.v1 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 514   Filed 01/05/22   Page 10 of 40 PageID #: \n24270\n24.   Evidence  to  support  this  defense  will  be  presented  throughout  the  trial, \nincluding by Defendants’ security expert, John Upchurch, Secretary James M. Le Blanc, \nAssistant Secretary Seth Smith, and DWCC security officers.  Plaintiffs really do not contest \nthis point as their own expert, Dr. Haney, concedes the need for restrictive housing, as he \nmust. \nDefense 4 – Restrictive Housing at DWCC is necessary, consistent with practices of \nprisons throughout the country, and is not cruel and unusual punishment. \n \n25.  DWCC is a maximum custody facility accredited by the American Correctional \nAssociation.  It is an extremely well-run facility, is clean, and is well maintained.  \n26.  DWCC is divided into two compounds: the North Compound and the South \nCompound. The North Compound houses offenders in a general population in a dorm type setting.  \nThe South Compound has cells with open bars that houses offenders in a restrictive housing setting. \n27.  Offenders housed in tiers A, B, and C of N2 and in buildings N3-N4 are classified \nas maximum custody.  Offenders housed in N2 D tier are closed cell restriction (“CCR”).  \nOffenders housed in N1 are classified as medium custody. \n28.  Restrictive housing is primarily used to house offenders who have committed \nmultiple violent offenses outside and/or inside of prison.  Restrictive housing is a disciplinary \nprocedure used to control aberrant behavior by both mentally ill and non-mentally ill offenders. \n29.  Offenders in restrictive housing at DWCC are dangerous and violent men.  Indeed, \noffenders with a history of disciplinary offenses that cannot be appropriately housed elsewhere can \nbe transferred to DWCC. \n30.  Defendants will show evidence of injury that can occur when violent offenders are \nremoved from restrictive housing.  Plaintiffs do not address or consider the adverse impacts of \n10 \n62639725.v1 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 514   Filed 01/05/22   Page 11 of 40 PageID #: \n24271\nmoving violent offenders who cannot abide by prison rules from restrictive housing to general \npopulation. \n31.  Prisons  throughout  the  country  utilize  restrictive  housing.    DPS&C’s  use  of \nrestrictive housing is consistent with prisons throughout the country, including both the percentage \nof offenders housed in restrictive housing and the length of time that offenders remain in restrictive \nhousing.  \n32.  Defendants will show evidence through the Liman Survey and testimony of experts \nthat as of 2019, 4.8% of offenders held in DPS&C were in restrictive housing.2  According to the \nLiman Survey and testimony of experts, that percentage is consistent with other states in the \ncountry. \n33.  Offenders housed in the South Compound may remain there for varying lengths \nof time depending on the individual circumstances of each particular offender.  The duration \nof each offender’s stay in the South Compound is highly variable and depends on the nature \nof the disciplinary issue and/or the overall risk the offender presents to offenders housed in \nthe general population, staff, and the public.  The key to progressing out of a restrictive \nhousing status is demonstrating that the offender is less of a threat to other offenders, the staff, \nand the public. \n34.  Offenders regularly progress from restrictive housing on the South Compound to \nthe general population housing on the North Compound at DWCC. \n                                                 \n2 The 4.8% number is calculated based on the offenders held directly by DPS&C.  DPS&C contracts with and houses \noffenders in local jails and prisons.  When the offenders housed in local jails and prisons is considered, the actual \npercentage of offenders housed in restrictive housing is reduced to about half that amount. \n11 \n62639725.v1 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 514   Filed 01/05/22   Page 12 of 40 PageID #: \n24272\n35.  Defendants will show evidence through the Liman Survey and testimony of experts \nthat as of 2019, the length of time that DPS&C holds offenders in restrictive housing is consistent \nwith other states in the country.  \n36.  Defendants will produce evidence that offenders are not isolated in restricted \nhousing. \n37.  Cells in restrictive housing are open front cells that face concrete walls and \nwindows which open to the outdoors. \n38.  A typical day for an offender in restrictive housing is approximately as follows in \npart: \na.  0500–0515 sick call slips \nb.  0600 Pill call \nc.  0600 Breakfast is delivered  \nd.  1030 Lunch is delivered  \ne.  1115 major count/Begin Feeding/Pill call  \nf.  Afternoon recreation time \ng.  1600 Major count \nh.  1600 Pill call  \ni.  1700 Dinner \nj.  1800 Shift change \nk.  Shower  \nl.  2230 Lights out \n39.  Offenders have regular and constant contact with others.  They can and do speak to \nother offenders in adjacent cells in conversational tones.  They recreate in chain link enclosed \nrecreation areas where they can converse with other offenders in the adjacent/nearby enclosures.  \nThirty-minute security checks are required by security staff in N1–N4.  Managers and supervisors \nvisit the tiers on a regular basis.  Offenders are also permitted to interact with staff if they wish \nduring their presence on the tiers.  In addition to all of the routine items listed above, there is \nclothing exchange, mail call, and library book exchange.  Haircuts and shaves are available in the \n12 \n62639725.v1 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 514   Filed 01/05/22   Page 13 of 40 PageID #: \n24273\ncommon area on a regular basis.  Offenders have call outs for medical, dental, vision, and mental \nhealth care.   \n40.   Many  offenders  are  double  bunked,  and  DWCC  screens  the  offenders  for \ncompatibility when selecting cellmates. \n41.  Weekend non-contact visitation is available. \n42.  Offenders are given one phone call per month, and calls to attorneys are not limited \nin number or duration. \n43.  Offenders are out of their cells for many reasons.  Offenders have daily recreation.  \nShowers are offered daily.  Indeed, offenders are required to take a shower at least once every 3 \ndays.  Call outs for medical, dental, vision, and mental health care occur.  \n44.  Any suggestion that the offenders are “isolated” is false. \n45.  Many offenders prefer restricted housing to general population because of the \nchallenges of living in an open bay dorm in prison. \nDEFENSE 5 – Offenders are screened and assessed for mental health illnesses before \nbeing assigned to restrictive housing. \n \n46.  Offenders sentenced to the DPS&C are typically initially assessed at Elayn Hunt \nCorrectional Center (“EHCC”) at the Hunt Reception and Diagnostic Center (“HRDC”) before \nbeing assigned to a specific DPS&C facility for housing.  \n47.   The EHCC assessment is extensive and consists of personality testing, IQ testing, \ninterviews, and results in a DSM-5 diagnosis of prisoners with mental illness.  The findings are \ndetailed in an Assessment & Intervention Report for each offender. \n48.  EHCC conducts an extensive screening process that assigns a DSM-5 diagnosis, \nwhere appropriate, and a level of care designation for offenders. \n \n13 \n62639725.v1 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 514   Filed 01/05/22   Page 14 of 40 PageID #: \n24274\n49.  DPS&C assigns the following level of care designations to offenders: \na.  LOC 1 – shall be assigned to offenders who have significant disability \nprimarily due to their mental health condition.  These offenders are housed in the special mental \nhealth housing units with a 24 hours medical and/or mental health presence.  These offenders \nrequire ongoing intensive intervention/supervision.  Housed at EHCC or HSU. \nb.  LOC 2 – shall be assigned to offenders with a diagnosis of SMI AND who \nhave been in remission for less than six months, or have displayed a pattern of instability, may not \nhave ability to follow directions or dysfunctional due to mental health illness.  Medication \nadherence and program participation are considered.  Offender should be capable of performing \nactivities of daily living satisfactorily. \nc.  LOC 3 – shall be assigned to offenders with SMI and who have been in \nremission or have been stable for at least six months.  These offenders may live in the general \nhousing areas.  A SMI diagnosis is typically chronic in nature and the offender will most likely \nremain diagnosed with SMI for the remainder of the offender’s life.  If they are stable, functional, \nand have no major problem with compliance, then they should be designated as LOC 3. \nd.  LOC 4 – shall be assigned to offenders with any Axis I diagnosis excluding \nsevere mental illness (SMI) and excluding addiction disorder diagnosis or those requiring mental \nhealth interventions within the last year. \ne.  LOC  5  –  not  prescribed  any  psychotropic  medication  or  current  MH \nintervention for more than one year. \n50.  Offenders with a designation of LOC 1 and LOC 2 are not housed at DWCC.  \nAccordingly, all offenders in restrictive housing on the South Compound either have no serious \n14 \n62639725.v1 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 514   Filed 01/05/22   Page 15 of 40 PageID #: \n24275\nmental illness or are in remission or are stable.  This fact cannot be overstated and is essential to a \nproper understanding of the case. \n51.  If an offender is placed by DPS&C at DWCC, DWCC staff then perform an intra-\nsystem mental health screening on intake at DWCC. \n52.  The DWCC intra-system mental health intake screening is designed to be a more \nlimited assessment than that performed at the HRDC.  \n53.  The “intra-system” screening includes: \na.  Inquiry into whether the offender: \n•  Has a present suicidal ideation; \n•  Has a history of suicidal behavior; \n•  Is presently prescribed psychotropic medication; \n•  Has a current mental health complaint; \n•  Is being treated for mental health problems; \n•  Has a history of inpatient and/or outpatient psychiatric treatment; \n•  Has a history of treatment for substance use; and/or \n•  Has a detoxification need. \n \nb.  Observation of: \n•  General behavior; \n•  General appearance; \n•  Evidence of abuse and/or trauma; and/or \n•  Current symptoms of psychosis, depression, anxiety, and/or aggression.3 \n \n54.  New intake offenders with a mental health diagnosis are scheduled to see DWCC’s \npsychiatrist, Dr. Seal, at the next available time. \n55.  DWCC provides offenders with an orientation which informs offenders of the \nvarious options available to address mental health concerns. \n56.  In the rare circumstance that an offender is not tested at EHCC prior to arrival \nand prior to housing being assigned by the initial classification board, the same battery of tests \n                                                 \n3 Ex. 22, Health Care Policy No. HCP37, §7(A)(3). \n15 \n62639725.v1 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 514   Filed 01/05/22   Page 16 of 40 PageID #: \n24276\nthe  offender  would  receive  at  EHCC  are  administrated  at  DWCC  and  reviewed  by  a \npsychologist. \n57.  The screening process identifies offenders with serious mental illness.  \n58.  The entirety of the DWCC MH staff will testify to the screening process that \ntakes place to identify offenders with serious mental illness.  \nDEFENSE 6 – Offenders housed in restrictive housing receive adequate mental health. \n59.  As the mental health care in the South Compound at DWCC is considered, it is \nimportant to remember that offenders who have a LOC 1 or LOC 2 classification are not housed \nthere.  All offenders in the South Compound either have no serious mental illness, are in remission, \nor are stable. \n60.  The mental health staff at DWCC as of March 15, 2020, consisted of the following: \na.  Warden Michelle Dauzat has a master’s degree in social work and is a board \napproved Licensed Clinical Social Worker.  Warden Dauzat has been in the mental health field for \nover 21 years and has worked at DWCC since January 6, 2003.  Warden Michelle Dauzat is \nresponsible for overseeing and supervising the mental health program and mental health staff at \nDWCC. \nb.  Steve  Hayden  possesses  a  master’s  degree  in  Industrial  Class \nOrganizational Psychology and has been employed at DWCC since January 3, 2005.  \nc.  As of March 2020, Aerial Robinson is a Licensed Master Social Worker \nemployed as a Social Service Counselor 2 at DWCC.  She was originally hired as a Social Service \nCounselor on September 20, 2016 and promoted to her current position on October 12, 2017.  \n16 \n62639725.v1 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 514   Filed 01/05/22   Page 17 of 40 PageID #: \n24277\nd.  James Burgos obtained a Master of Industrial Organizational Psychology in \n2006 and a Master of Counseling in 2017.  Mr. Burgos is a Licensed Professional Counselor, \nthrough the Louisiana Board of Licensed Professional Counselors.  \ne.  Johnie Adkins was previously a Social Service Counselor 1 at DWCC.  \nThough previously employed as a counselor, at all times from the date of the filing of this lawsuit, \nMr. Adkins has served as a chaplain for DWCC.  Johnie Adkins, is the holder of a Master’s of \nDivinity; Master’s of Religious Education; Master’s of Theology; and Doctorate of Theology.4 \nf.  Gregory Seal, M.D. has been contracted as a Psychiatrist at DWCC since \n2009.  Dr. Seal received his medical degree from LSU Medical Shreveport in 1988 and is board \ncertified.  Dr. Seal is not an employee of DPS&C.  Dr. Seal provides services for offenders held at \nDWCC both in general population and restrictive housing.  Dr. Seal’s contract, as of March 2020, \nwas to provide services at DWCC for 18 hours a month.  \ng.  The  medical  staff  at  DWCC  assists  with  mental  health  needs  when \nappropriate.  During weekends, when presented with an emergent situation or in response to a \nthreat of suicide, the medical staff will assist the mental health staff. \n61.  Based on demographic data across the country, it is a fact that a certain percentage \nof offenders in restrictive housing will have a history of mental illness. \n62.  The ratio of mental health staff to offenders on the South Compound at DWCC is \nadequate.  The opinion of Dr. Kathryn Burns stating that the ratio was inadequate was based on an \nincorrect census (too high) and did not include Mr. Burgos who had recently been hired. \n63.  Dr. Seal regularly sees offenders housed on the South Compound during his \nscheduled visits to DWCC.  Dr. Seal sees every offender on the mental health case load at least \n                                                 \n4 Mr. Adkins stopped providing mental health services in the first part of 2016.  He should never have been named as \na defendant in this suit for injunctive relief. \n17 \n62639725.v1 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 514   Filed 01/05/22   Page 18 of 40 PageID #: \n24278\nevery 90 days.  Dr. Seal determines the need and frequency of follow-up visits at each scheduled \nappointment, which may be sooner that 90 days. \n64.  If  an  offender  presents  with  a  need  for  intervention  prior  to  the  scheduled \nappointment, Dr. Seal will see him at his next available date. \n65.  Dr. Seal stays at DWCC until he has seen all of the patients scheduled for the day. \n65.  Dr. Seal’s diagnoses of the offenders are appropriate and accurate.  Importantly, \nthis is an uncontested fact.  Dr. Burns, Plaintiffs’ expert psychiatrist, had no criticisms of Dr. Seals’ \ndiagnoses. \n66.  Medication is the primary form of treatment for mental disorders of offenders \nlocated in restrictive housing. \n67.  Dr. Seal performs the traditional role of a prison psychiatrist and the management \nof medications.  Again, Dr. Burns agrees with this statement, which was in an article that she \npublished. \n68.  Dr. Seal’s conduct in his role of management of medication is appropriate.  Dr. \nBurns has no criticisms of either the type or amount of medications administered by Dr. Seal. \n69.  There has never been a mental health backlog at DWCC from 2017 to March 2020. \n70.  Once identified and seen by Dr. Seal, offenders with mental illness are followed by \na dedicated mental health staff that includes a master’s level psychologist, two social workers, and \nlicensed counselor. \n71.  Every offender presented to the Court will have numerous contacts with mental \nhealth staff. \n72.  A treatment plan is created for each offender.5 \n                                                 \n5 The weakness of the treatment plans is addressed below. \n18 \n62639725.v1 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 514   Filed 01/05/22   Page 19 of 40 PageID #: \n24279\n73.  Mental Health staff at DWCC perform weekly rounds on the South Compound and \ncounsel mental health offenders during those rounds. \n74.  An offender can request mental health through numerous avenues, including the \nsick call process, declaring an emergency, and through a correctional officer.  Indeed, any \ncorrectional officer or other employee at DWCC can request mental health assistance for an \noffender at any time.   \n75.  Group Programming is available to offenders on N1 and N2-D. \n76.  Although group therapy is not afforded in other restrictive housing areas due to \nsecurity concerns, mental health staff do provide individualized counseling to mental health \noffenders in restrictive housing.  Additionally, written materials relating to group therapy sessions \nare made available to offenders on N2–N4.  \n77.  Mental health progress notes and segregation interviews are completed using \nstandardized forms containing checkboxes for various aspects of a mental status examination.  \n78.  DWCC mental health staff create written records of interviews with offenders, \nprogress notes, and assessments after interactions with offenders. \n79.  If it is determined that an offender is in need of a higher level of care, DWCC will \ntransfer the offender to EHCC. \n80.  Plaintiffs’ expert witnesses did not opine that the level of care designation of the \noffenders is incorrect. \n81.  The percentage of offenders with serious mental illness at DWCC has remained \nrelatively the same since 2017. \n82.  Because correctional officers play an important role in identifying mental illness, \nall DWCC staff are required to participate in annual training which includes mental health training.  \n19 \n62639725.v1 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 514   Filed 01/05/22   Page 20 of 40 PageID #: \n24280\nPart of that annual training is the Mental Health First Aid curriculum and suicide prevention \ntraining. \n83.  If an offender is on medication upon arrival at DWCC, the medications come with \nthe offender, and medications are continued by the general medical doctor unless there is an \nindication that these medications may be harmful to the offender.   \n84.  Offenders who arrive at DWCC with a mental health diagnosis are scheduled to see \nDr. Seal, at the next available time, within 14 days at the most.   \n85.  Dr. Seal prescribes appropriate psychotropic medications in appropriate dosages. \n86.  All mental health medications are monitored and distributed using “blister packs” \nwhich are specifically numbered and are monitored by nursing staff at DWCC. \n87.  Medications are administered by pill call officers.  Pill call officers are provided \nspecific training on administering medications. \n88.  Weaknesses in the mediation administration records (“MARs”) are addressed \nbelow. \n89.  Mental health observations (“MHO”) are utilized to follow an individual offender \nmore closely who is experiencing an acute exacerbation of symptoms which is considered \ntemporary by medical professionals.  MHO is appropriate for offenders who are psychotic, in acute \ndistress, noncompliant with psychotropic medication, or otherwise psychologically impaired to a \nsignificant degree, but not considered a high risk for suicidal behavior. \n90.  An offender on MHO is seen daily by mental health or medical staff. \n91.  DWCC through its dedicated mental health staff provides adequate mental health \ncare to the offenders on restrictive housing. \n20 \n62639725.v1 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 514   Filed 01/05/22   Page 21 of 40 PageID #: \n24281\n92.  Plaintiffs’ complaints in large part are that there are additional things that could be \ndone, such as group therapy.  But the law is clear that “[t]he Constitution . . . ‘does not require \nthat prisoners, as individuals or groups, be provided with any amenity which some person \nmay think is needed to avoid mental, physical, and emotional deterioration.’” Dockery v. Hall, \n443 F. Supp. 3d at 748 (citing Newman, 559 F.2d at 291). \nDEFENSE 7 – DWCC’s use of suicide watch is appropriate. \n93.  DWCC has two types of suicide watch, standard and extreme.  The mental health \nstaff at DWCC places an offender on suicide watch if there is a question of suicide because it is \nbetter to err on the side of caution and institute a suicide watch when in doubt as opposed to taking \nno action and allowing an offender to commit suicide. \n94.  Mental health staff completes a mental health management order (“MHMO”) on \neach new suicide watch.  With the clinical judgment of the mental health staff, the MHMO \ndescribes the techniques to be used, which property items are permitted, and which property is \nprohibited.  Removing an offender’s property while on suicide watch is an appropriate procedure \ndesigned to reduce the risk of completed suicide while an offender is on suicide watch. \n95.  DWCC will present evidence of offenders using property such as gowns and \nmattresses to attempt suicide or make suicidal gestures. \n96.  Placing an offender in a room with a camera for monitoring is an appropriate \nprocedure to reduce the risk of suicide while a prisoner is on suicide watch. \n97.  An offender on suicide watch is seen and evaluated daily; mental health staff sees \nprisoners on suicide watch daily on Monday through Friday; nursing staff sees offenders on the \nweekends. \n21 \n62639725.v1 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 514   Filed 01/05/22   Page 22 of 40 PageID #: \n24282\n98.  Offenders on standard suicide watch receive in-person observation at least every \nthirty minutes, preferably every fifteen minutes, and also randomly between intervals. \n99.  The standard in-person observation for extreme suicide watch is every fifteen \nminutes and randomly between intervals. \n100.  Extreme suicide watches can only be utilized by DWCC’s mental health staff with \nthe concurrence of a medical doctor. \n101.  Offenders on suicide watch are also monitored by the key room officer through the \nuse of the in-cell cameras. \n102.  Restraints used on extreme suicide watch may be: (1) four-point restraints, (2) \nplacing an offender in a restraint chair, or (3) use of a helmet to prevent head banging. \n103.  The use of the restraint chair is infrequent and limited to only the time deemed \nnecessary by the mental health staff with the concurrence of a medical doctor. \n104.  The mental health staff at DWCC decides when to end a suicide watch. \n105.  Upon termination of suicide watch, mental health staff contacts and evaluates the \noffender within seven days.  \n106.  DWCC does not overuse suicide watch.  The average number of standard suicide \nwatches per month is 9.59, and the average number of extreme suicide watches per month is 2.16.  \nDr. Burns, Plaintiffs’ psychiatrist, did not find that DWCC overuses suicide watch. \n107.  DWCC does not keep offenders on suicide watch for too long a period of time.  The \naverage time on standard suicide watch is 3.48 days.  Dr. Burns found that to be appropriate. \n108. DWCC does not have a problem with too many completed suicides.  DWCC’s use of \nsuicide watch does not create a substantial risk of harm.  Indeed, to the contrary, DWCC’s use of \nsuicide watch is appropriate and working as intended. \n22 \n62639725.v1 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 514   Filed 01/05/22   Page 23 of 40 PageID #: \n24283\nDEFENSE 8 – Offenders are manipulative and act out; such behavior is a disciplinary \nissue, not a mental health issue. \n \n109.  Training materials for officers at DWCC, although addressing female security \nofficers, captures the problem and provides that: \nAn offender has 24-hours to think of ways to manipulate officers. Offenders have \nnothing but time to observe, time to hear, and profit from everything they know \nabout an officer and his job. Offenders are predators, they watch the female \nemployees, they target female employees, the offenders identify weak links, and \nset up employees to gain confidence. \n \nBasic Security Academy: Offender Manipulation (D31, p. 31). \n  110.  Dr. Thompson, Defendants’ expert psychiatrist, will testify to offenders engaging \nin manipulative behavior and that such manipulative behavior is a security issue, not a mental \nhealth issue. \n  111.  The records in this case are replete with specific examples of offenders engaging in \nmanipulative behavior.  Offenders will claim suicidal ideation to be placed on suicide watch for \nmany reasons other than being suicidal. \n112.  Offenders will claim to be suicidal in order to secure a different cell assignment.  \nDWCC employees will provide testimony as to this practice.  In addition, on 05/21/18, as to \nCharles, “When questioned about S/I, offender stated, ‘I didn’t want to be by the shower and make \nsecurity work.’” (D63, pp. 110-111). See Exhibit D78 generally.  On 05/10/18, Jones “states that \nhe needs to be placed into the chair to, ‘make these bit** mo** f***ing officers work.’  He further \nreports that he is homicidal/suicidal and plans to inform his lawyers if I do not comply with his \nwishes.”  (D70, pp. 60-61). See Exhibit D78. \n  113.  Offenders will claim to be suicidal in order to be transferred to an institution of \ntheir choice.  This is an improper and manipulative use of suicide watch.  Offender records provide \nthe following examples: \n23 \n62639725.v1 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 514   Filed 01/05/22   Page 24 of 40 PageID #: \n24284\n•  05/22/18, Charles admitted that he had been attempting suicide to attempt to get shipped \nto EHCC. (D63, pp. 113-114). \n•  08/30/18, Adams stated that “he plans to eat lunch and be placed on ESW until he is given \na transfer.” (D64, p.293).  There are numerous other records of Adams invoking suicide \nfor placement at DWCC and elsewhere. \n•  03/29/19, Doucet “told Colonel Nail, I ain’t playing move me back to Hunts.” (D71, p. 31).  \nThere are many other records of Doucet threatening suicide for placement. \n•  05/28/19, Sullivan “reports A/I and refuses to be removed from SSW until he is given a \ntransfer to the institution of his choice.” (D68, pp. 73-74). \n \nSee Exhibit D78. \n \n114.   Offenders will claim to be suicidal in order to make security work or to get back at \nsecurity: \n•  08/06/17, Charles reported that he was angry with security staff and made false claims of \nS/I in order to make them ‘work.’” (D63, pp. 16-17). \n•  05/15/18, Charles placed a gown around his neck.  “When questioned about gesture, \noffender stated, “I’m still getting back at security.” (D64, pp. 88-89). \n•  05/15/18, Charles, “when questioned about SI, offender stated, ‘I’m not suicidal! I’m just \nmessing with security.’” (D63, pp. 91-92). \n•  10/11/18, Jones “reports that he was given a false RVR and now he is going to make \nsecurity staff work.  He further reports S/I.” (D70, p. 82). \n \nSee Exhibit D78. \n \n115.  Offenders refer to claiming suicide ideation in order to make security work as \n“playing” with security.  Just a few examples of such actions are: \n•  09/06/18, Adams, when questioned about SI, Adams stated “I’m tired of playing. I’m not \nsuicidal.” (D64, pp. 300-301). \n•  09/12/18, When asked about suicide ideation, Adams stated “This is how this sh** works, \nyou M*** F***kers want to play games with me and F*** with me, I play games with you \nand F*** with you.  I’m M*** F***king suicidal.” (D64, pp. 310-311). \n•  12/14/18, Caro stated, “I’m done playing with y’all. You know I wasn’t going to kill \nmyself.” (D75, pp. 195-196). \n \nSee Exhibit D78. \n \n  116.   In a most disturbing turn of events, offenders have taken actions in order to further \ntheir legal claims, such as in this lawsuit.  Examples of such actions include: \n24 \n62639725.v1 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 514   Filed 01/05/22   Page 25 of 40 PageID #: \n24285\n•  05/03/18, Charles “reports that after speaking with his lawyer it was decided that he not \n[take] any medication unless he can be placed on his choice (Wellbutrin).  He denies any \nS/I, H/I, or other MH concerns.  He was encouraged to continue taking his medications as \nprescribed.” (D63, pp. 81-82). \n•  09/20/18, Adams reported that “he is in an upbeat mood due to the fact he and his lawyers \nhave successfully sued LSP and about to ‘shut them down’ and are in the process of doing \nthe same to DWCC.  When asked if he had any S/I he replied, ’Yeah, I’m f***king \nsuicidal’” (D64, pp. 321-322). \n•  12/13/18, Caro reported “This ain’t nothing against you, but I got them lawyers working \nfor me and need to stay of in here a little bit longer.” (D75, p. 194). \n \n  117.  Indeed, there is some evidence of offenders taking action as directed by their \nlawyers: \n•  09/24/19 and 10/02/19, Solomon told Steve Hayden that his lawyers told him not to speak \nwith Hayden because he was not licensed.6 (D69, pp. 113 & 119).  “My lawyers already \ntold me that I don’t have to have shit to do with you.” (D69, p. 119). \n•  05/10/18, Jones demanded the restraint chair and threatened to inform his lawyers if \nHayden did not comply.7 (D70, pp. 60-61). \n \n118.  In addition, a review of the files of specific offenders’ records undercut Plaintiffs’ \nclaims. \n119.  Plaintiffs  have  submitted  a  two-hour  video  of  Anthony  Caro  being  sprayed.  \nPlaintiffs argue that Caro was decompensating and that DWCC responded by spraying him with \nchemicals.  The record does not support that claim at all.   \n                                                 \n6 The 09/24/19 note is particularly troublesome.  It reads: \n \nWhen offender Solomon was seen in regards to his sick call he stated, “I ain’t fixing to talk to you’re \na**.  My lawyers already told me that I don’t have to have sh** to do with you.  Trot you a** back \ndown and get that bit** Dauzat.  After she talks to me she can show me that pretty little pus*** of \nhers.  On second thought just tell that bit** to come and show me her pus***.  She is too stupid to \ntalk to since she is the one who hired your a**.   \n \n(D69, p. 113). \n7 A suspicious interaction occurred with Charles on 07/18/17 when he demanded that he be placed in restraints.  Ms. \nRobinson, the mental health worker, explained that there was no reason for restraints.  Charles then cut himself to \nmake her place him in restraints. (D63, pp. 46-47). \n \n25 \n62639725.v1 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 514   Filed 01/05/22   Page 26 of 40 PageID #: \n24286\n120.  Professionals at EHCC, not DWCC, diagnosed Caro as malingering. (D75, pp. 15, \n19 & 22).  After being transferred to DWCC, Caro threatened suicide numerous times. (D75, pp. \n35 – 60 and 75-93).  On 04/03/18, Caro stated that: \nhe has no need for mental health medications and only agreed to take them to assist \nwith his being transferred.  He further states that he will be no problems for staff if \nhe is transferred as he was promised. \n \n(D75, pp. 96-97).  Dr. Seal nevertheless referred Caro to EHCC for evaluation.  On 05/09/18, \nEHCC diagnosed Caro as malingering for transfer. (D75, p.105).  Caro was sent back to DWCC.  \nOn 06/26/18, Caro stated that: \nOffender reports that he only agreed to take medication due to Col. Nail promising \nto transfer him if he did.  He further reports that he will not take any medication \nand is giving the Col. 1 week to transfer him before “he goes the f*** off.” \n \n(D75, pp. 113-114).  As promised, on 07/09/18, Caro went off.  He snatched his hands away from \ncorrectional officers with the cuffs on two occasions.  Cell extraction teams had to retrieve him \nfrom the cell when he would not comply as the Colonel and Hayden tried to persuade him to \ncomply. (D75, pp. 115-144).  The video is evidence of a preplanned deliberate bad act, not mental \nhealth decompensation.  Caro knew exactly what he was doing and why he was doing it. \n  121.  Adams is another offender that the Plaintiffs contend support their claims.  Again, \nthe records say otherwise.  Adams’ behavior at LSP (Angola) and EHCC prior to coming to DWCC \nwas identical to his behavior at DWCC. \n  122.  Adams was housed at LSP (Angola) in 2017.  While at LSP, there were 16 separate \ninstances of Adams cutting himself, three instances of him hitting his head or hands against the \nbars, and he smeared feces on himself. (See D64, pp. 9-45).  He was transferred to DWCC from \n11/28/17 through 02/26/18.  He was stable during that period of time and made the classification \nboard to be eligible for medium custody. (D64, p. 55). \n26 \n62639725.v1 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 514   Filed 01/05/22   Page 27 of 40 PageID #: \n24287\n123.  On 02/26/17, Adams was transferred to EHCC. (D64, p. 56).  EHCC diagnosed \nAdams as malingering for placement. (D64, pp. 57, 62, 90, 96, 127).  Adams was at EHCC for 56 \ndays, 02/26/18 through 04/22/18. (D64, pp. 56-166).  During 56 days at EHCC, Adams cut himself \n8 times.  In fact, on 03/14/18, Adams threatened to cut himself, stating, “F** it, I am going to cut \nmy self cause I did not get double portions.” (D64, p.92).  Then, five days later on 03/19/18, he \nactually did cut himself because he did not get double portions. (D64, p.104).  During his 56 days \nat EHCC, Adams banged his head against the wall three times and smeared feces on himself.  In \none of his last encounters with mental health while at EHCC, Adams was asked on 04/16/18 why \nhe went off/on suicide watch so much.  He responded “because of his legal work.” (D64, p. 160). \n  124.  On 04/23/18, Adams was transferred back to DWCC. (D64, p. 167).  The records \nproduced in the litigation go through 09/25/18.  During the 150 days from 04/23/18 through \n09/25/18, Adams cut himself 10 times, exactly like he did at LSP and EHCC. \n  125.  Adams received much mental health care at EHCC and at DWCC.  During his 56 \nday stay at EHCC, there are 71 records of mental health contact.  During the 150 days at DWCC, \nthere are 78 records of contact with mental health staff. \n  126.   Adams was clearly being manipulative.  On 08/07/18, Adams told Hayden that he \nhad retained lawyers from the Advocacy Center and that he would see them in court. (D64, pp. \n241-243).  On 08/17/18, Adams threatened to act out if he did not get specific medications he \nwanted, i.e., “I want Wellbutrin.  I’ve tried asking.  Now you will see.” (D64, p. 262).  He would \ngo on suicide watch to play with security.  On 09/06/18, he stated, “I tired of playing.  I’m not \nsuicidal.” (D64, p. 301).  On 09/12/18, he stated, “This is how this sh** works, you Mo*** \nF****ers want to play games with me and f*** with me, I play games with you and f*** with you.  \n27 \n62639725.v1 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 514   Filed 01/05/22   Page 28 of 40 PageID #: \n24288\nI’m mo*** f***ing suicidal.”(D64, p. 311).  The record clearly shows that Adams was a bad actor, \nnot an offender with a serious mental illness. \n  127.  Charles is another offender who acted out and did not have a serious mental illness.  \nPrior to 05/22/18, Charles was a combative and difficult offender.  He was on numerous suicide \nwatches during that period of time.  However, on 05/22/18, everything changed.  Charles stated at \nthe time that:  \nhe has never taken MH meds and never will.  He was attempting to be shipped to \nEHCC but now wants to do the small amount of time he has left and get out of \nprison.  \n \n(D63, p. 114).  In line with that confession, on 05/31/18, Dr. Seal discontinued Depakote because \nhe was not taking it. (D63, p. 115).  A mental health progress note dated 06/19/18 stated that \nCharles was “doing well since removal of his mental health medications.” (D63, p. 122).  On \n11/02/18, Charles’ LOC changed from LOC 3 to LOC 5. (D63, p.130).  On 07/30/19, Charles was \nreassigned to medium custody. (D63, p. 137).  Over the next several months, Charles completed \n14 re-entry courses. (D63, pp. 138-140).  He was released on 11/06/19.  \n  128.  Charles’ records show that he was a bad actor, not an offender with serious mental \nillness. \n  129.  In many respects, the Court will have to make a credibility determination as to \nwhom  to  believe.    The  testimony  of  offenders  who  are  convicted  criminals  and  known \nmanipulators must be weighed against the testimony of the DWCC staff who are charged with the \ndifficult and thankless job of maintaining the prison.  Testimony of DWCC staff is supported by \nrecords generated contemporaneously over time.  The evidence clearly weighs in favor of the \nDefendants and against the Plaintiffs. \n \n28 \n62639725.v1 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 514   Filed 01/05/22   Page 29 of 40 PageID #: \n24289\nDEFENSE 9 – DWCC’s security practices, specifically use of force, are appropriate. \n130.  It should go without saying that security concerns in a prison are of paramount \nimportance – the security concerns are magnified in a maximum-security prison housing offenders \nwho are violent both before entering prison and while in prison. \n131.  Correctional officers on the South Compound can use chemical spray to obtain \ncompliance from offenders who refuse to comply with the officers’ commands. \n132.  Correctional officers turn on their body cameras when the use of chemical spray or \nother use of force is anticipated.  The body camera videos show that the correctional officers \nrepeatedly advise the offender that chemical spray will be used if the offender persists in not \ncomplying with orders. \n133.  Use of Force incidents at DWCC are reviewed by the Unit Manager who oversees \nthe South Compound.  Either Col. Lonnie Nail or Col. Tyrone Mays were the unit managers for \nthe South Compound at all times relevant to this trial.  \n134.  Use of Force incidents are required to be reported by DWCC to DPS&C in the \nmonthly C-05 report.  The C-05 report shows that DWCC averages 9.08 uses of spray per month. \n135.   Offenders who throw items on the tier, at staff members, or at other offenders can \nbe placed on Policy 34, which restricts their property to prevent recurrence of these types of \nincidents. \n136.  An offender who engages in behavior prohibited by Policy 34 can be placed on that \nstatus for 24 hours the first time he engages in that behavior. \n137.  As of March 2020, an offender who engaged in a pattern of behavior prohibited by \nPolicy 34 may be placed on that status for 30 days.8 \n                                                 \n8 This is an example of a policy change that the Defendants contend should be considered at this time.  Policy 34 \nnow provides a seven-day review period. \n29 \n62639725.v1 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 514   Filed 01/05/22   Page 30 of 40 PageID #: \n24290\n138.  Correctional officers do not barter with offenders for privileges such as showers.  \nSuggestions otherwise are categorically denied. \n139.  Correctional officers do not open windows in the winter time to punish offenders \nor make conditions more uncomfortable for offenders.  This is a myth known as “bluesing” that is \nspread among offenders. \n140.  The Department of Corrections is charged with staff, offender, and public safety. \n141.  It is a necessary and commonly accepted practice in correctional systems to \nseparate a portion of the offender population securely and more restrictively from the general \npopulation. \n142. Segregated, restrictive housing serves as a punitive sanction for violent and/or \ndisruptive misconduct by offenders. \n143. Longer-term restrictive housing for offenders with a pattern of continued serious \nviolent and disruptive conduct serves as an incapacitation function, keeping the staff, other \noffenders, and the public safe and secure. \nDEFENSE  10  –  Two  identified  deficiencies  to  not  rise  to  the  level  of  deliberate \nindifference or cruel and unusual punishment. \n \n  144.  Defendants recognize two issues identified by the Plaintiffs pertaining to the \nMedication Administration Records (MARs) and Treatment Plans. \n  145.   As to the MARs, Plaintiffs have argued that the MARs at DWCC are inaccurate. \n  146.   In response, Defendants acknowledge a problem with the MARs.  That said, \nDefendants are confident that offenders have received their medications.  All mental health \nmedications are monitored and distributed using “blister packs” which are specifically numbered \nand are monitored by nursing staff at DWCC.  This procedure operates to ensure that offenders \nreceive their medications.   \n30 \n62639725.v1 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 514   Filed 01/05/22   Page 31 of 40 PageID #: \n24291\n147.  Certain of the psychotropic medications prescribed by Dr. Seal require monitoring \nof blood levels of the offenders.  The blood tests operate as another indication that the medications \nare being delivered. \n148.  Offenders are not required to take medications.  Indeed, there are numerous records \nshowing  that  offenders  were  non-compliant  and  DWCC  mental  health  staff  encouraging \ncompliance with medications.  \n150.  Plaintiffs’ experts will testify that MARs are difficult to complete and that many \nprisons have difficulty effectively completing MARs. \n  151.  Recognizing the problem with the MARs, DWCC assigned new officers as pill call \nofficers and reemphasized the training for those officers. \n  152.  While the MARs need to be and should be accurate, considering the evidence that \nmedications were delivered, this is not a constitutional violation.  The court in Dockery v. Hall, \n443 F. Supp. 3d at 740, addressed problems with MARs in that case and held that:  \nTo the extent the missed doses or untimely administration of medications evidenced \non the MARs reflect human error or poor record keeping, they do not amount to \nconstitutional violations. \n \n  153.  The second area identified by the Plaintiffs as problematic is treatment plans at \nDWCC.  \n  154.  Defendants agree that the treatment plans needed to be more rigorous and were in \nthe process of developing new treatment plans going forward.9 \n  155.  The Court in Dockery v. Hall also addressed treatment plans in that case and held \nthat the fact that plaintiffs wanted different treatment plans did not establish a constitutional \nviolation.  Again, that holding should apply here. 443 F. Supp. 3d at 742. \n                                                 \n9 The new treatment plans are currently in place and operating. \n31 \n62639725.v1 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 514   Filed 01/05/22   Page 32 of 40 PageID #: \n24292\nDefense 11 – Defendants are not subjectively deliberately indifferent to South Compound \nOffenders’ serious mental health needs.  \n \n156.  None of the defendants are being subjectively indifferent to prisoners’ serious \nmental health needs.  \n157.  Secretary Le Blanc has worked with the Vera Institute in good faith to address \nalleged concerns regarding restrictive housing and has made adjustments throughout DPS&C \naccordingly.   \n158.  DPS&C closed Camp J at the Louisiana State Penitentiary (“LSP”), a restrictive \nhousing facility, which has resulted in the transfer of certain prisoners from LSP to DWCC. \n159.  The bottom line is that DPS&C has decreased its reliance on restrictive housing \ndramatically over the last several years.  In 2017, 19% of the offender population in DPS&C was \nin restrictive housing; by 2019, the percentage of offenders held in restrictive housing had \ndecreased to 4.8%, a percentage consistent with other states in the country.   \n160.  Warden  Goodwin  has  relied  upon  the  advice  and  counsel  of  mental  health \nprofessionals as to the appropriate means to provide mental health care to offenders on the South \nCompound. \n161.  DWCC has reduced the number of offenders in restrictive housing.  DWCC does \nnot keep prisoners on restrictive housing for longer periods than other prisons around the country.  \n162.  Colonel Nail and Colonel Mays have overseen security of the South Compound \nwhile complying with directives from superiors and relying upon mental health professionals as to \nthe appropriate means to provide mental health care to prisoners on the South Compound. \n163.  Dr.  Seal  has  provided  treatment  and  appropriate  medication  management  to \nprisoners on the South Compound as shown by the fact that Dr. Burns is not critical of Dr. Seal’s \ndiagnoses or medication management of prisoners. \n32 \n62639725.v1 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 514   Filed 01/05/22   Page 33 of 40 PageID #: \n24293\n164.  Warden  Dauzat  has  supervised  and  overseen  mental  health  care  to  prisoners \nfollowing the guidance from established DOC policies and Dr. Seal. \n165.  Defendants Mr. Hayden, Ms. Robinson (and Mr. Burgos) have provided mental \nhealth care to prisoners in compliance with policies directed by superiors and under the guidance \nof Dr. Seal. \n166.  Defendant Adkins no longer provides mental health care at DWCC. \n167.  Dr. Thompson, chief of psychiatry at Tulane University, has opined that the mental \nhealth care provided by DWCC is more than adequate. \n168.  Weaknesses identified through the litigation have been addressed.  DWCC has \nexpanded its mental health staff.  The MARs and Treatment Plans were addressed above.  In \naddition, DPS&C implemented new policies which were in the final pilot stage as of 3/15/20. \nII.   PLAINTIFFS FAIL TO STATE A CLAIM FOR VIOLATION OF THE ADA OR \nTHE RA. \n \n169.  A plaintiff states a claim for relief under Title II of the ADA if he alleges: (1) that \nhe has a qualifying disability; (2) that he is being denied the benefits of services, programs, or \nactivities for which the public entity is responsible, or is otherwise discriminated against by the \npublic entity; and (3) that such discrimination is by reason of his disability. Hale v. King, 642 F.3d \n492, 499 (5th Cir. 2011). \n170.  The purpose of the ADA as specifically stated by Congress is “to provide a clear \nand comprehensive national mandate for the elimination of discrimination against individuals with \ndisabilities.” 42 U.S.C. 12101(b)(1).   \n171.  The ADA provides that “no qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason \nof such disability, be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services, \n33 \n62639725.v1 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 514   Filed 01/05/22   Page 34 of 40 PageID #: \n24294\nprograms, or activities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any such entity.” 42 \nU.S.C. 12132.  \n172.  The RA is interpreted the same as the ADA with certain exceptions not applicable \nhere. Smith v. Harris Cty., Tex., 956 F.3d 311, 317 (5th Cir. 2020).  \n173.  The ADA is not meant to be an “end run” around Eighth Amendment cases. Bryant \nv. Madigan, 84 F.3d 246, 249 (7th Cir. 1996). \n174.  The ADA proscribes discrimination against disabled individuals.  The Eastern \nDistrict of Louisiana in Williamson v. Larpenter, No. 19-254, 2019 WL 3719761, at *14 (E.D. La. \nJuly 15, 2019) held that: “the ADA is a discrimination statute.  The fact that a person has a \nqualifying disability is not alone sufficient to state a cognizable ADA claim.  Instead, the person \nwith a disability must also establish causation, i.e., that he was discriminated against in the \nprovision of benefits, services or programs by reason of his disability.” (emphasis in original). See \nalso Kokinda v. Pa. Dep’t of Corr., 779 F. App’x 944, 950 (3d Cir. 2019) (claim was dismissed \nbecause plaintiff failed to “assert that he was excluded from a program or service on account of or \nbecause of his disability as required”); Goodman v. Johnson, 524 F. App’x 887, 890 (4th Cir. \n2013) (ADA claim dismissed because plaintiff “failed to allege facts indicating that, due to his \ndisability, he has been deprived of benefits for which he was otherwise qualified”); Bryant, 84 \nF.3d at 249 (failure to attend to a disabled person’s needs is not a violation of the ADA where no \ndiscrimination is alleged and the disabled person is not treated worse because he was disabled.); \nMaccharulo v. N.Y. Dep’t of Corr. Servs., No. 08-301, 2010 WL 2899751, at *3 (S.D.N.Y July \n21, 2010) (“Therefore, when there is no allegation of ‘disparate treatment,’ . . . between disabled \nand  non-disabled  individuals,  the  plaintiff  has  not  stated  a  claim  under  the  ADA  or  the \nRehabilitation Act.”); Lee v. State, Dep’t of Corr. Servs., No. 97-7112, 1999 WL 673339, at *14 \n34 \n62639725.v1 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 514   Filed 01/05/22   Page 35 of 40 PageID #: \n24295\n(S.D.N.Y. Aug. 30, 1999) (plaintiff’s allegations suffered from a fundamental defect in that they \nfailed to state that the offender was excluded from any prison service or program because of his \ndisability).  \n175.  Neither the ADA nor the RA applies to claims regarding the quality of mental \nhealth services. Smith, 956 F.3d 318 n.1 (“[T]he ADA does not typically provide a remedy for \nnegligent medical treatment.”); Atkins v. Cty. of Orange, 251 F. Supp. 2d 1225, 1232 (S.D.N.Y. \n2003); Simmons v. Navajo Cty., Ariz., 609 F.3d 1011, 1022 (9th Cir. 2010) (“The ADA prohibits \ndiscrimination because of disability, not inadequate treatment for disability.”); Bryant, 84 F.3d at \n249 (the ADA is not “violated by a prison’s simply failing to attend to the medical needs of its \ndisabled prisoners” where no discrimination is alleged).  \n176.  Similarly, a claim that challenges the adequacy or the substance of services that are \nprovided to a disabled individual is not a valid claim under either the ADA or the RA. Maccharulo, \n2010 WL 2899751, at *3; Atkins, 251 F. Supp. 3d at 1232.   \n177.  Disciplinary action taken as a result of misconduct is not discrimination based upon \na disability as to mental health. See O’Guinn v. Nev. Dep’t of Corr., 468 F. App’x 651, 654 (9th \nCir.  2012)  (claim  rejected  because  O’Guinn  failed  to  produce  evidence  showing  that  his \ndisciplinary action was on account of his disability—rather than on account of his misconduct). \n178.  “[H]arsh conditions [of administrative segregation] may well be necessary and \nappropriate in light of the danger that high-risk inmates pose both to prison officials and to other \nprisoners.” Wilkinson v. Austin, 545 U.S. 209, 224 (2005).   \n179.  If the entity does not provide the program, service or activity as a general matter, \nthen the entity has no duty under Title II to provide an accommodation for disabled persons.  This \nmakes sense because the goal of the ADA is to provide equal access to individuals with disabilities \n35 \n62639725.v1 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 514   Filed 01/05/22   Page 36 of 40 PageID #: \n24296\nto opportunities and benefits, not to provide privileges withheld from everyone else. Williamson, \n2019 WL 3719761, at *15 (quoting Irby v. Sumnicht, 683 F. Supp. 2d 913, 917 (W.D. Wis. 2010)) \n(emphasis in original) (In Williamson, the offender asserted that the “defendants discriminated \nagainst him by denying him access to therapy, group programs, and regular trips to a mental health \nfacility.”  The court addressed the ADA claims specifically by noting that the jail did not provide \nany of the services to any of the inmates at the jail.  The court then noted that, the plaintiff “was \nnot treated differently from other inmates.”).  \n180.  The mere fact that conditions may be harsh is not an allegation of discrimination. \nWilkinson, 545 U.S. at 224.  “[R]outine discomfort is part of the penalty that convicted prisoners \npay for having committed crimes.” Williamson, 2019 WL 3719761, at *11. \n181.  Prior to March 2020, Deputy Warden Angie Huff was the ADA liaison at DWCC. \n182.  Heat precaution duty statuses for offenders on certain psychotropic medication are \nordered by medical or mental health staff, and heat advisories are determined by temperature and \ndeclared facility-wide by DWCC’s control center. \n183.  During a heat advisory at DWCC, offenders on the South Compound are provided \nice throughout the day, afforded additional showers, provided wet towels, and the jumpsuit policy \nis relaxed. \n184. The tiers of buildings N1-N4 have oscillating fans and windows that can be opened \nwhen the weather is hot. \n185.  DWCC staff receive training on the ADA which includes how to identify and meet \noffender needs related to their disabilities.  \n186.  Plaintiffs’ underlying assumption appears to be that all offenders on the South \nCompound are entitled to accommodations.  That assumption is false.  Recall that DWCC does \n36 \n62639725.v1 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 514   Filed 01/05/22   Page 37 of 40 PageID #: \n24297\nnot house offenders classified as LOC 1 or LOC 2 and that many offenders in restrictive housing \ndo not have a mental illness.  Thus, there is no blanket across the board need for accommodations \nunder the ADA due to mental health in the South Compound. \n187.  Defendants are aware of no request for accommodation due to mental health that \nhas not been addressed. \n188.  Most ADA accommodations at DWCC are handled informally based on staff \nobservation or offender’s inquiry without the offender having to file a request for accommodation. \n189.  Disciplinary action taken as a result of misconduct is not discrimination based upon \na mental health disability. \n190.  Discipline against offenders with mental illness is allowed in a prison setting. \n191.  Restrictive housing is necessary and appropriate for offenders with mental illness \nif they pose a danger to the public, prison officials, and/or other offenders. \n192.  Group therapy and/or group programs are not available to any offender in restrictive \nhousing at DWCC, including offenders with or without a disability.  Individual study and \ncounseling are permitted. \n193.  Offenders in disciplinary segregation, both with or without a disability, have access \nto programs through written materials and individual counseling. \n194.  All offenders in restrictive housing are treated the same with regard to the types of \nmental health treatment available to them. \nIII.  PLAINTIFFS’ FIRST AMENDMENT CLAIMS FAIL. \n  195.  Defendants categorically deny all allegations pertaining to the First Amendment \nand/or alleged interference with the attorney-client relationship between Plaintiffs and counsel.  \nDefendants demand strict proof of any such allegations. \n37 \n62639725.v1 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 514   Filed 01/05/22   Page 38 of 40 PageID #: \n24298\n196.  Defendants deny interfering with legal mail in any respect. \n197.  Major Angela Matthews with the DWCC mail room will testify regarding the mail \nroom procedures. \n198.  Outgoing legal mail is gathered by passing locked boxes marked “US Mail” on the \ntiers in the South Compound. \n199.   DWCC mail officers are the only individuals with keys to the South Compound \nmail boxes. \n200.  DWCC mail officers retrieve outgoing legal mail from the locked mail boxes \nlocated on the South Compound on a daily basis. \n201.  DWCC mail officers do not open or inspect outgoing sealed legal mail. \n202.  DWCC mail officers stamp legal mail envelopes “not responsible for contents” \nsince the mail is not inspected.   \n203.  DWCC mail officers then personally deliver the mail to the United States Postal \nService office located on Homer, Louisiana. \n204.  DWCC mail officers are the only employees allowed in the mail room.   \n198.   Incoming legal mail is retrieved by DWCC mail officers from the Post Office in \nHomer and delivered to the DWCC mail room. \n199.  Incoming legal mail is not opened or inspected by DWCC mail officers. \n200.  The incoming legal mail is sorted and delivered to the ranking officer on each South \nCompound tier for delivery to inmate recipients on N1 – N4. \n201.  The ranking officer on each tier delivers the sealed mail to the inmate recipient and \nhas the recipient sign a receipt for the mail. \n38 \n62639725.v1 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00541-EEF-MLH   Document 514   Filed 01/05/22   Page 39 of 40 PageID #: \n24299\n202.  The inmate recipient is then required to open the mail in front of the ranking officer \nto confirm that it does not include contraband. \n203.  The inmate recipient maintains control of the mail, and it is not read by the ranking \nofficer. \n204.  The signed delivery receipt is then returned to the DWCC mail officers. \n205.  Any complaints about the condition of mail received by the Advocacy Center is not \nthe fault of DWCC.
