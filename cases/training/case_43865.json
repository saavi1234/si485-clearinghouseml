    "summary": "<p>On November 30, 2016, Planned Parenthood brought this suit in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Missouri Central Division against Missouri state officials to challenge several abortion restrictions. In particular, Plaintiffs asserted that Missouri&rsquo;s Ambulatory Surgical Center Licensing Law and Hospital Relationship Restriction unconstitutionally burdened access to abortion in the state. These statutes would have required health centers that provide abortions to be licensed as ambulatory surgical centers and physicians who provide abortions to have various forms of hospital admitting privileges and/or a written transfer agreement with a nearby hospital. Plaintiffs sought (1) a declaratory judgment stating that Missouri&rsquo;s Ambulatory Surgical Center Licensing Law and Hospital Relationship Restriction are unconstitutional, (2) injunctive relief preventing the state from enforcing these statutes, and (3) attorneys fees and costs. This case was first assigned to District Judge Howard F. Sachs and then reassigned to District Judge Fernando J. Gaitan, Jr., and then District Judge Brian C. Wimes.</p>\r\n<p>Defendants filed a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction on January 10, 2017, and after hearing oral arguments, the court denied the motion to dismiss on March 10, 2017, affirming that the case was ripe for adjudication.</p>\r\n<p>On April 19, 2017, the court granted Plaintiff&rsquo;s motion for a preliminary injunction, preventing the state from enforcing either statute as litigation continued in order to protect the public interest and the status quo. 263 F.Supp.3d 729. Defendants then filed an appeal in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eight Circuit on May 4, 2017 (17-1996). Defendants also filed a motion to stay the preliminary injunction pending appeal on the same day, which was later denied by the circuit court on May 17, 2017, and affirmed by the Eighth Circuit on June 2, 2017. On September 12, 2017, a majority of the active judges on the Eighth Circuit voted to grant Defendants' petition for rehearing en banc, and after that rehearing, the court again denied the motion for stay on October 3, 2017.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On September 10, 2018, the Eighth Circuit vacated the district court&rsquo;s decision to grant a preliminary judgment and remanded the case back to the district court. The Eighth Circuit based its reasoning on its judgment that the district court had erred in considering a facial challenge on substantive due process grounds for the Ambulatory Surgical Center Licensing Law and did not weigh the state's \"asserted benefits\" of enforcing the Hospital Relationship Restriction. Plaintiffs then filed a second motion for a temporary restraining order and/or preliminary injunction on September 19, 2018. The district court denied this motion on October 3, 2018. Plaintiffs then filed a third motion for preliminary injunction on December 22, 2018, which was again denied on February 22, 2019. Plaintiffs once again appealed this decision on March 28, 2019 to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eight Circuit, but then dismissed the appeal on April 29, 2019 (19-1656).</p>\r\n<p>On March 6, 2019, Plaintiffs filed a motion to stay this case until the Supreme Court of the United States issued a decision in <a href=\"../../../../case/43154/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">J<em>une Medical Services, L.L.C. v. Gee</em></a>, or in the alternative, to voluntarily dismiss the case without prejudice. On April 9, 2019, the court granted the motion to stay for a limited duration, until a status conference to be held on August 12, 2019. On August 13, 2019, the motion to stay was denied and the motion to dismiss without prejudice was granted. The trial court believed that regardless of whether the Supreme Court would grant the petition for writ of certiorari in June Medical Center in October 2019, it would necessitate a further extension of the stay and a current extension of the stay would only delay the resolution of Plaintiff&rsquo;s claims in this Court.</p>",

Doc. 99. I understand briefing is closed.   \n \n  The  State  Defendants  first  urge  a  “jurisdictional”  bar,  asserting  prematurity \nbecause they say there is no live controversy absent various applications to hospitals \n                                                      \n1 The surgical center requirement invalidation was limited temporarily in response to \njointly-proposed language of counsel.  \n[1] \n \nCase 2:16-cv-04313-BCW   Document 108   Filed 05/17/17   Page 1 of 3\n\n(by  plaintiff doctor) or to the regulatory Department (by clinics). This was dealt with in \nDoc. 66. Further articulation would be superfluous. The State Defendants have cited no \nsupporting authority from abortion litigation, which has been voluminous.  There is a live \ncontroversy unless the statutes and regulations are “moribund.” Doe v. Bolton, 410 U.S. \n179, 188 (1973). Ripeness was dealt with in my prior ruling, and is not further argued \nhere, or referred to in oral argument. \n \n  The preliminary injunction merits also need little elaboration from what was said \nin Doc. 93. Both publicly and in the motion to stay the State Defendants assert they are \nprotecting abortion patients’ health in this litigation.  The converse is demonstrably true.  \nWomen seeking abortions in Central Missouri and Southwest Missouri but who are \nunable to obtain help from a local clinic can deal with an unwanted pregnancy in three \nways. Some can obtain an abortion at a distant clinic; some can attempt to self-abort or \nseek unprofessional service; others can submit to an unwanted birth. The absence of a \nnearby professional abortion clinic provides no safety advantage for any of the three \ngroups.  Birthing,  compared  with  abortion,  increases  patient  danger  14  times  in  the \nUnited States, according to the Supreme Court.  Whole Woman’s Health v Hellerstedt, \n136 S.Ct 2292, 2315 (2016).  Many persons will welcome the birthing option, other than \nthe prospective mother, but it cannot be claimed as a health measure, unless the State \nDefendants want me to argue with the Supreme Court.2  The third group is forced into  a \n                                                      \n2 Based on briefing and discovery requests, the State Defendants apparently want me \nto “correct” the Supreme Court on the underlying facts accepted and announced as the \nviews of the majority in the Texas case.  They have had several opportunities to offer \nlegal support for such a practice and have not done so. To change an analogy used \nearlier, that is like asking district judges to reject the authority of District of Columbia v. \nHeller, 554 U.S. 570 (2008) by saying that Justice Scalia got his history wrong and the \n[2] \n \nCase 2:16-cv-04313-BCW   Document 108   Filed 05/17/17   Page 2 of 3\n\nvery dangerous situation by the absence of a local clinic.  It is hard to believe that the \nState Defendants would urge desperate women who reject the birthing option to avoid a \nclinic and seek the “safety” of self-abortion or back-alley abortions, but they offer no \nlogic or argument to the contrary.

Doc. 99. I understand briefing is closed.   \n \n  The  State  Defendants  first  urge  a  “jurisdictional”  bar,  asserting  prematurity \nbecause they say there is no live controversy absent various applications to hospitals \n                                                      \n1 The surgical center requirement invalidation was limited temporarily in response to \njointly-proposed language of counsel.  \n[1] \n \nCase 2:16-cv-04313-BCW   Document 108   Filed 05/17/17   Page 1 of 3\n\n(by  plaintiff doctor) or to the regulatory Department (by clinics). This was dealt with in \nDoc. 66. Further articulation would be superfluous. The State Defendants have cited no \nsupporting authority from abortion litigation, which has been voluminous.  There is a live \ncontroversy unless the statutes and regulations are “moribund.” Doe v. Bolton, 410 U.S. \n179, 188 (1973). Ripeness was dealt with in my prior ruling, and is not further argued \nhere, or referred to in oral argument. \n \n  The preliminary injunction merits also need little elaboration from what was said \nin Doc. 93. Both publicly and in the motion to stay the State Defendants assert they are \nprotecting abortion patients’ health in this litigation.  The converse is demonstrably true.  \nWomen seeking abortions in Central Missouri and Southwest Missouri but who are \nunable to obtain help from a local clinic can deal with an unwanted pregnancy in three \nways. Some can obtain an abortion at a distant clinic; some can attempt to self-abort or \nseek unprofessional service; others can submit to an unwanted birth. The absence of a \nnearby professional abortion clinic provides no safety advantage for any of the three \ngroups.  Birthing,  compared  with  abortion,  increases  patient  danger  14  times  in  the \nUnited States, according to the Supreme Court.  Whole Woman’s Health v Hellerstedt, \n136 S.Ct 2292, 2315 (2016).  Many persons will welcome the birthing option, other than \nthe prospective mother, but it cannot be claimed as a health measure, unless the State \nDefendants want me to argue with the Supreme Court.2  The third group is forced into  a \n                                                      \n2 Based on briefing and discovery requests, the State Defendants apparently want me \nto “correct” the Supreme Court on the underlying facts accepted and announced as the \nviews of the majority in the Texas case.  They have had several opportunities to offer \nlegal support for such a practice and have not done so. To change an analogy used \nearlier, that is like asking district judges to reject the authority of District of Columbia v. \nHeller, 554 U.S. 570 (2008) by saying that Justice Scalia got his history wrong and the \n[2] \n \nCase 2:16-cv-04313-BCW   Document 108   Filed 05/17/17   Page 2 of 3\n\nvery dangerous situation by the absence of a local clinic.  It is hard to believe that the \nState Defendants would urge desperate women who reject the birthing option to avoid a \nclinic and seek the “safety” of self-abortion or back-alley abortions, but they offer no \nlogic or argument to the contrary. They are asking the courts to maintain these unsafe \noptions pending litigation.3 \n \n  For reasons stated here, in my prior grant of relief to plaintiffs pending litigation, \nand in plaintiffs’ suggestions (Doc. 105), the motion to stay (Doc. 99) is hereby DENIED.   \n \n \n                                /s/  Howard F.

(Doc. #201). The Court, being duly advised of the premises, grants said \nalternative motion and dismisses without prejudice the above-captioned matter.  \nBACKGROUND \nOn March 6, 2019, Plaintiffs filed a motion to stay this case until (1) the Supreme Court of \nthe United States issued a decision in June Medical Services, L.L.C. v. Gee, 905 F.3d 787, 790 \n(5th Cir. 2018); and (2) resolution of Plaintiff Reproductive Health Services of Planned Parenthood \nof the St. Louis Region’s waiver requests relating to its facility in Springfield, Missouri. (Doc. \n#188).1 On April 9, 2019, over Defendants’ objection, the Court granted in part and denied \nPlaintiffs’ motion (Doc. #196). Specifically, the Court granted the motion to stay for 120 days, \nthus denying the stay as to the requested duration. Further, the Court set this case for status \nconference by telephone on August 12, 2019. (Doc. #196). The stay expired on August 7, 2019. \n                                                            \n1 RHS is no longer pursuing the facility waiver process.  \n1 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-04313-BCW   Document 206   Filed 08/13/19   Page 1 of 4\n\nOn August 2, 2016, Plaintiffs filed the instant motion to extend the stay, or in the \nalternative, to dismiss this case without prejudice. (Doc. #201). On August 6, 2019, Defendants \nfiled opposition suggestions (Doc. #203), and Plaintiffs replied on August 8, 2019 (Doc. #204). \nDuring the status conference on August 12, 2019, the Court heard summary arguments \nfrom the parties with respect to the motion to extend the stay and/or to dismiss without prejudice. \nThe Court, having considered the parties’ arguments, the briefing on the motion, and the applicable \nlaw, grants Plaintiffs’ alternative motion to dismiss their claims without prejudice.  \nLEGAL STANDARD  \n  A district court has broad discretion to stay proceedings. Clinton v. Jones, 520 U.S. 681, \n706 (1997). This discretion is incidental to a court’s inherent power “to control the disposition of \nthe causes on its docket with economy of time and effort for itself, for counsel, and for litigants.” \nLandis v. N. Am. Co., 299 U.S. 248, 254 (1936). A stay may be appropriate if it is “in the interests \nof justice and judicial economy in order to prevent waste of resources, avoid inconsistent rulings, \nand reduce uncertainty.” Express Scripts, Inc. v. Aegon Direct Mktg. Servs., No. 4:06-CV-1410 \nCAS, 2007 WL 1040938, at *3 (E.D. Mo. Apr. 3, 2007).   \n  Further, pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 41(a)(2), “an action may be dismissed at the plaintiff’s \nrequest only by court order, on terms that the court considers proper.” Whether a plaintiff should \nbe permitted to voluntarily dismiss a case without prejudice falls within the district court’s \ndiscretion. Thatcher v. Hanover Ins. Grp., Inc., 659 F.3d 1212, 1213-15 (8th Cir. 2011) (citing \nHamm v. Rhone-Poulenc Rorer Pharm., Inc., 187 F.3d 941, 950 (8th Cir. 1999)). In considering \nwhether dismissal without prejudice is appropriate, the following factors are relevant: “whether \nthe party has presented a proper explanation for its desire to dismiss; whether a dismissal would \n2 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-04313-BCW   Document 206   Filed 08/13/19   Page 2 of 4\n\nresult in a waste of judicial time and effort; and whether a dismissal will prejudice the defendants.” \nId. \nANALYSIS \n  Plaintiffs seek extension of the stay in this matter pending completion of the Supreme \nCourt’s proceedings in June Medical Center. In the alternative to extending the stay, Plaintiffs seek \nvoluntary dismissal of this matter without prejudice. Defendants Schmitt, Williams, and Patterson \noppose Plaintiff’s extension motion, while Defendant Knight takes no position with respect to the \nextension request. Defendants Schmitt, Williams, Patterson, Baker, and Kenney do not oppose \nPlaintiff’s alternative motion for voluntary dismissal, while Defendant Knight takes no position \nwith respect to the alternative request.  \nThe Court is not inclined to stay this matter pending the Supreme Court’s determination in \nJune Medical Center. While probable the Supreme Court’s ruling in that case will be instructive \nin resolving Plaintiffs’ claims, the Court is not inclined to enter an indefinite stay of this case. \nWhile Plaintiffs assert the Supreme Court will consider whether to grant the petition for writ of \ncertiorari in June Medical Center in October 2019, the Supreme Court’s decision to hear the case \nwill likely necessitate a further extension of the stay. In the event the Supreme Court denies cert \nin June Medical Center, extending the stay in this case would only delay resolution Plaintiff’s \nclaims in this Court. Therefore, the Court, within its discretion and having considered the relevant \nfactors, denies Plaintiff’s motion to extend the stay. \nBy contrast however, the Court grants Plaintiff’s alternative motion for voluntary dismissal \nwithout prejudice. Plaintiffs assert that because the only issue remaining in this case is the Hospital \nPrivileges Requirement at the Columbia facility, and this Court has denied Plaintiffs’ motion for \npreliminary injunction based on this issue, pursuing this litigation on the merits would be an \n3 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-04313-BCW   Document 206   Filed 08/13/19   Page 3 of 4\n\ninefficient use of resources for the parties and the Court at this time. Additionally, Plaintiffs argue \nthat dismissal at this stage would promote judicial economy by avoiding further litigation without \nthe benefit of “further guidance from the Supreme Court,” or any other change in circumstances. \nFinally, Plaintiffs argue Defendants will not be prejudiced by voluntary dismissal because though \nthis case was filed on November 11, 2016, this litigation has not progressed on its merits. The \nCourt, within its discretion, for the reasons set forth in Plaintiffs’ alternative motion, and with \nDefendants having no objection, grants Plaintiff’s motion for voluntary dismissal. Accordingly, it \nis hereby \nORDERED Plaintiffs’ Motion to Extend Stay, or in the Alternative, to Dismiss Without \nPrejudice (Doc. #201) is GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART. The motion to stay is \ndenied and the motion to dismiss without prejudice is granted. It is further \nORDERED this matter is DISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE.  \nIT IS SO ORDERED. \n \n \nDated: August 13, 2019  /s/ Brian C. Wimes   \nJUDGE BRIAN C.

Peck, 10 U.S. 87, 128 (1810)\n(Marshall,  C.J.).   At  a  minimum, it requires adequate information  and  correct\napplication of the relevant standard.  Because we conclude that the preliminary\ninjunction in this case was entered based on less than adequate information and an\ninsufficient regard for the relevant standard, we vacate the preliminary injunction and\nremand. \nI.\nThe roots of this case can be traced to 2007.  That year, the Missouri legislature\namended the statutory definition of “ambulatory surgery center” (“ASC”) to include\n-2-\n\nmost facilities that performed abortions.1  A number of consequences followed, two\nof which are at issue here.  The first flows from statutory language.  By law, all\ndoctors who perform abortions at ASCs must be “privileged to perform surgical\nprocedures in at least one licensed hospital in the community.”  Id. § 197.215.1(2). \nThe  implementing  regulations  have  further  refined  the  “in  the  community”\nrequirement to mean a licensed hospital that is 15 minutes away.  Mo. Code Regs.\nAnn. tit. 19, § 30-30.060 (1)(C)(4).  We refer to this as the “Hospital Relationship\nRequirement.”  \nThe second consequence  at  issue flows  from enacting  regulations.  The\nMissouri  Department  of  Health  and  Senior  Services  (“DHSS”)  has  delegated\nauthority to enact health and safety regulations for abortion facilities.  Mo. Rev. Stat.\n§ 197.225.1.  Pursuant to that authority, the DHSS has adopted a number of physical\ndesign  and  layout  requirements  specifically  for  facilities  that  perform  surgical\nabortions.  Mo. Code Regs. Ann. tit. 19, § 30-30.070(1) (“This regulation does not\napply to abortion facilities that do not perform surgical abortions.”).2  We refer to\nthese  regulations  collectively  as  the  “Physical  Plant  Regulations.”    These\nrequirements, however, are not fixed in stone.  Instead, they are waivable upon\nwritten request.  Id. § 30-30.070(2) (“Requests for deviations from requirements on\nphysical facilities shall be in writing to the [DHSS].”).  We refer to this specific\nprovision as the “Waiver Provision.”  The record contains one instance in normal\n1The definition of ASC included “any establishment operated for the purpose\nof performing or inducing any second or third-trimester abortions or five or more\nfirst-trimester abortions per month.”  Mo. Rev. Stat. § 197.200 (2007).  More\nrecently, Missouri has amended Section 197.200 to separately define an “abortion\nfacility” as any facility performing abortions.  Id. § 197.200.  That definitional change\ndoes not impact our decision here.\n2The regulations were changed during the pendency of these proceedings to\nexempt facilities that only provided medicinal abortions.  \n-3-\n\ncourse where a minor request was made—and granted—for waiver from a single\ndesign requirement. \nA.\nThis is not the first time these laws have been challenged.  Prior to the current\nsuit,  Appellee  Comprehensive  Health  of  Planned  Parenthood  Great  Plains\n(“Comprehensive Health”) brought facial and as-applied challenges to the statutory\nclassification of abortion facilities as ASCs almost immediately after the provision\nwent  into  effect  in  2007.3    Comprehensive  Health  succeeded  in  its  as-applied\nchallenge only.  The district court enjoined the ASC statutory classification (and\nattendant requirements) for two facilities Comprehensive Health operated: one in\nKansas City and one in Columbia.  \nComprehensive Health and the State of Missouri settled the lawsuit in 2010\n(“2010 Settlement”).  The parties agreed to modifications of the requirements of the\nPhysical Plant Regulations for the Columbia facility and a complete waiver of the\nrequirements for the Kansas City facility.  And Comprehensive Health agreed to\nrelease any claims “whether or not now known or contemplated” that are “based on\nor arising out of the allegations in Lawsuits relating to licensure of the Columbia and\n[Kansas City] Centers.” \nB.\nThe 2010 Settlement was not the last word, however.  After the Supreme\nCourt’s decision in Whole Woman’s Health v. Hellerstedt, 136 S. Ct. 2292, as revised\n(June 27, 2016), Comprehensive Health sent a letter to DHSS calling both the\n3Comprehensive Health was formerly known as Planned Parenthood of Kansas\nand Mid-Missouri, Inc. \n-4-\n\nHospital Relationship Requirement and the classification of abortion facilities as\nASCs “unconstitutional and unenforceable.”  It demanded that DHSS stop enforcing\nthe provisions against Comprehensive Health facilities.  This suit began shortly\nthereafter.\nUnlike its initial suit, Comprehensive Health is joined here by Reproductive\nHealth Services of Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region (“RHS”), and Dr.\nRonald Yeomans—a gynecologist who wishes to provide abortions at Comprehensive\nHealth facilities in Missouri.  Together, Comprehensive Health and RHS represent\nevery  facility  that  provides  or  is  seeking  to  provide  abortions  in  Missouri:\nComprehensive Health operates facilities in Kansas City and Columbia, and RHS\noperates a facility in St. Louis and has plans to operate in Springfield and Joplin.  The\ncomplaint  here  sought  declaratory  and  injunctive  relief  to  roll  back  the  2007\namendment which classified (most) abortion facilities as ASCs.  It also sought\nspecific  relief  from  the  Hospital  Relationship  Requirement.    Both  the  ASC\nclassification  and  the  Hospital  Relationship  Requirement  were  challenged  on\nsubstantive due process and equal protection grounds.4  \nAfter evidentiary submissions and a brief hearing, the district court issued a\nslightly narrower preliminary injunction.  It preliminarily enjoined enforcement of the\nHospital Relationship Requirement—as well as certain associated criminal penalties\nfor doctors who violate it—and the Physical Plant Regulations solely on substantive\ndue process grounds.  In doing so, it found that Hellerstedt “controls [its] ruling.” \nBecause of that, it refused to weigh any evidence of benefits of the provisions,\nlikening Missouri’s advocacy on this front to an “attempt[] to undermine Brown v.\nBoard of Education, 347 U.S. 483 (1954).” \n4The suit was brought against various Missouri officials in their official\ncapacities.  For ease, we refer to the state appellants collectively as “Missouri.”  \n-5-\n\nMissouri now seeks to vacate the preliminary injunction. \nII.\nOur review of a preliminary injunction is layered: fact findings are reviewed\nfor clear error, legal conclusions are reviewed de novo, and the “ultimate decision to\ngrant the injunction” is reviewed for abuse of discretion.  McKinney ex rel. NLRB\nv. S. Bakeries, LLC, 786 F.3d 1119, 1122 (8th Cir. 2015) (internal quotation marks\nomitted).  In order to preliminarily enjoin state laws, a district court “must . . . make\na threshold finding that a party is likely to prevail on the merits.”  Planned Parenthood\nMinn., N. D., S.D. v. Rounds, 530 F.3d 724, 732-33 (8th Cir. 2008) (en banc).  Put\nanother way, “without a likelihood of success, an injunction is not justified.”  Does\nv. Gillespie, 867 F.3d 1034, 1046 (8th Cir. 2017).    \nWith  this  framework  in  mind,  we  proceed  to  review  the  district  court’s\ninjunction with regards to the Physical Plant Regulations and Hospital Relationship\nRequirement separately.  \nA.\nMissouri first argues that the Physical Plant Regulations were improperly\nenjoined  because  the  Appellees  had  not  “ripened”  their  claims.    Drawing  on\nadministrative law jurisprudence, they argue “[w]here a regulatory regime provides\nfor variances, a constitutional challenge to those restrictions is not ripe until the\nchallenger has sought—and been denied—a variance.”  So because none of the\nfacilities run by Appellees had utilized the Waiver Provision, the district court’s\ninjunction of the Physical Plant Regulations was improper.\nThe  main  case  they  cite  in  support  of  this  argument—Suitum  v.  Tahoe\nRegional Planning Agency, 520 U.S. 725 (1997)—explicitly undercuts this point. \n-6-\n\nThere, it was noted that “facial challenges to regulation”—the only challenges at\nissue here—“are generally ripe the moment the challenged regulation or ordinance\nis passed.”  Id. at 736 n.10.  Missouri has not demonstrated why that general principle\nshould not apply here.  \nIn fact, it would make little sense to find an exception here.  The constitutional\nquestion in this case turns on the law’s “effect . . . on women seeking abortions.” \nHellerstedt, 136 S. Ct. at 2306 (alteration in original) (internal quotation marks\nomitted).  It is a woman’s substantive due process right that Appellees, as third-\nparties, are asserting.  Singleton v. Wulff, 428 U.S. 106, 117 (1976) (noting it is the\n“constitutionally protected abortion decision” which a physician may “litigate” on a\nthird-party  basis).    Stated  differently,  “[t]his  suit  is  possible  only  because  the\n[Supreme] Court has allowed abortion clinics and physicians to invoke a putative\nconstitutional right that does not belong to them—a woman’s right to abortion.” \nHellerstedt, 136 S. Ct. at 2321-22 (Thomas, J., dissenting).  To hold that Appellees\nmust “ripen” a facial constitutional claim, which they do not possess, would be\nincongruous with the fact that the holder of such a right could bring the same facial\nchallenge  without  any  avenue  to  “ripen”  it.    See  Singleton,  428  U.S.  at  118\n(emphasizing providers “assert the rights of women patients”).  We reject Missouri’s\nargument.  \nThis is not to say, however, that a facial challenge to the Physical Plant\nRegulations on substantive due process grounds is justiciable at the present moment. \nTo be clear, while we have said that individual organizations or facilities need not\napply for waivers to “ripen” a facial claim, that does not mean we can decide a facial\nchallenge to the Physical Plant Regulations without information about the Waiver\nProvision.  Here, there is scant evidence as to how the Waiver Provision actually\noperates.  As noted above, the record contains only one instance of a request for a\nminor waiver in normal course.  In that case, it was granted with a single page letter\n-7-\n\nfrom DHSS.  In cases like this, the “[r]ules of justiciability” counsel against a\ndecision “based upon [an] amorphous and ill-defined factual record.”  Renne v.\nGeary, 501 U.S. 312, 324 (1991).  \nRefraining from “premature” decisions on facial challenges is a proper exercise\nof judicial restraint.  See, e.g., Wash. State Grange v. Wash. State Republican Party,\n552 U.S. 442, 450 (2008) (holding courts should “[e]xercis[e] judicial restraint” to\nprevent “premature interpretations of statutes in areas where their constitutional\napplication might be cloudy.” (internal quotation marks omitted)).  This is especially\ntrue when adjudicating the constitutionality of state laws.  Arizonans for Official\nEnglish  v.  Arizona,  520  U.S.  43,  79  (1997)  (“Warnings  against  premature\nadjudication of constitutional questions bear heightened attention when a federal\ncourt is asked to invalidate a State’s law.”).  And perhaps the decisive factor pointing\ntowards restraint is the fact-intensive nature of the constitutional test here: the undue\nburden standard.  \nHellerstedt made clear that the undue burden standard “requires that courts\nconsider the burdens a law imposes on abortion access together with the benefits\nthose laws confer.”  136 S. Ct. at 2309.  The standard is so intertwined with\nunderlying facts that  “later, concrete factual developments” can affect whether or not\nthe same law violates the undue burden standard.  Id. at 2305-06 (finding that res\njudicata did not bar claims because a pre-enforcement challenge was brought on a\ndifferent factual record than the post-enforcement challenge at bar).  As a result, the\nconstitutional scrutiny required by the undue burden standard has been likened to a\nform of “cost-benefit analysis.”  Fourteenth Amendment-Due Process Clause-Undue\nBurden-Whole Woman’s Health v. Hellerstedt, 130 Harv. L. Rev. 397, 404 (2016);\nsee also Clare Huntington, The Empirical Turn in Family Law, 118 Colum. L. Rev.\n227,  250  (2018)  (noting  that  the  undue  burden  standard  is  “fundamentally  an\nempirical inquiry”).  \n-8-\n\nAppellees underscore just how “cloudy,” Wash. State Republican Party, 552\nU.S. at 450, the “cost-benefit analysis” is currently with respect to the Physical Plant\nRegulations, Fourteenth Amendment, supra, at 404.  In their brief, they admit three\nof the five facilities in Missouri providing or seeking to provide abortions—the\ncenters in Kansas City and Columbia operated by Comprehensive Health and the\nRHS facility in St. Louis—do not “need[] further relief from [the Physical Plant\nRegulations] in order to provide abortion.”  Appellee Br. 34.5  Granted, for the Kansas\nCity and Columbia centers, this is because they obtained waivers from DHSS after\nlitigation and a settlement.  But, the point still stands: if DHSS operates its waiver\nprocess with sufficient flexibility, the Physical Plant Regulations would not lead to\n“fewer doctors, longer waiting times, and increased crowding” such that it would\nconstitute an undue burden.  Hellerstedt, 136 S. Ct. at 2313.  Because the record is\npractically devoid of any information on the mechanics of the Waiver Provision, a\ncourt has no way to make that judgment. \nThe district court nevertheless made such a judgment, and we conclude that in\ndoing so it committed an error of law.  “It would take a very hardy [DHSS] Director,”\naccording to the district court, “to agree voluntarily to establishment of abortion\nclinics  .  .  .  out  of  compliance  with  ASC  standards.”    And  so  it  enjoined  the\nregulations on the presumption that a DHSS Director would act less than scrupulously\non any waiver application.6 Our starting point, though, is the polar opposite:  “‘[t]he\n5Appellees also concede that only one of the two remaining facilities is seeking\nto provide surgical abortions and thus only that facility will be subject to the Physical\nPlant Regulations.  Appellee Br. 4 n.1 (noting that only Springfield facility is seeking\nto provide surgical abortion). \n6The  district  court  also  suggested  in  a  footnote  that  the  law  at  issue  in\nHellerstedt contained a waiver provision for abortion facilities.  Hellerstedt, however,\nnoted that the law before it “neither grandfathers nor provides waivers for any of the\nfacilities that perform abortions.” 136 S. Ct. at  2315.  \n-9-\n\ngood faith of [state] officers and the validity of their actions are presumed.’”  Robbins\nv. Becker, 794 F.3d 988, 995 (8th Cir. 2015) (second alteration in original) (quoting\nSunday Lake Iron Co. v. Wakefield Twp., 247 U.S. 350, 353 (1918)).  The district\ncourt’s rationale is further called into question by the waiver granted by the DHSS in\n2015—the  only evidence  in  the  record  regarding  the  operation  of  the  Waiver\nProvision in the normal course.\nIn sum, we believe a substantive due process challenge to the Physical Plant\nRegulations—governed by the “cost-benefit analysis” required by the undue burden\nstandard—is not currently fit for judicial resolution given the paucity of evidence on\nhow DHSS will grant waivers.  Again, we emphasize this is distinct from the position\nMissouri has advocated.  We are not holding that a facial claim must be “ripened.” \nWe  simply  hold  that  we  lack  sufficient  information  to  make  a  constitutional\ndetermination on the Physical Plant Regulations.  Any ruling now would mean “our\ndisposition . . . would lack the clarity and force which ought to inform the exercise\nof judicial authority.”  Geary, 501 U.S. at 324.  Furthermore, hardship would not be\nimposed by withholding constitutional judgment.  Cf. Parrish v. Dayton, 761 F.3d\n873, 875 (8th Cir. 2014) (courts must assess “hardship to the parties of witholding\ncourt consideration” (internal quotation marks omitted)).  No facilities currently\nproviding abortions would be closed because of the Physical Plant Regulations.  Cf.\nHellerstedt, 136 S. Ct. at 2301 (imposition of regulations caused closure of more than\nten abortion facilities).  And currently it appears that only one prospective location\n(Springfield) is seeking to provide surgical abortions, meaning that the Physical Plant\nRegulations is pertinent only to that facility.  See supra note 6.  If that one facility\napplied for a waiver, we would have some semblance of a record as to how the DHSS\nexercises the Waiver Provision.  In other words, we would not have to “wade through\na quagmire of what-ifs”—if litigation is pursued—to assess the facial validity of the\nPhysical Plant Regulations.  Mo. ex rel. Mo. Highway & Transp. Comm’n v. Cuffley,\n-10-\n\n112 F.3d 1332, 1338 (8th Cir. 1997).  Or a waiver application by the Springfield\nfacility may mean that litigation is not pursued at all.  \nOn  remand,  the  district  court  should  not  consider  a  facial  challenge  on\nsubstantive due process grounds to the Physical Plant Regulations.  That does not end\nthe matter, though.  The Appellees asked for broader injunctive relief from the\nstatutory ASC classification, Mo. Rev. Stat. § 197.200 (2007), but the district court\nentered a less capacious injunction of only the Physical Plant Regulations.  Broader\nrelief is likely foreclosed because Appellees trained the complaint (and injunction\narguments) solely on the Physical Plant Regulations.  But, given the “narrow” nature\nof our review at this stage, we leave it to the district court to decide this question in\nthe first instance.  Taylor Corp. v. Four Seasons Greetings, LLC, 315 F.3d 1039, 1041\n(8th Cir. 2003). \nB.\nWe now shift to the Hospital Relationship Requirement.  Unlike the Physical\nPlant Regulations, the Hospital Relationship Requirement operates by statute, is\nunwaivable, and is enforced by criminal penalty.  The district court erred in enjoining\nit (and related criminal provisions) because the district court did not apply the plain\nlanguage of Hellerstedt.7\n7Missouri argues that Appellees lack standing to pursue a challenge to the\nHospital  Relationship  Requirement  if,  as  we  have  decided,  the  Physical  Plant\nRegulations are non-justiciable.  They argue that any challenge is not redressable\nbecause the Physical Plant Regulations act as an independent barrier to operating\nabortion facilities.  Factually, that is not accurate given the limited scope of the\nPhysical Plant Regulations which apply only to facilities providing surgical abortions. \nMore importantly, as we emphasized earlier, this is a third-party facial challenge.  The\nconcern on facial review is whether “in a large fraction of the cases in which [the\nHospital Relationship Requirement] is relevant, it will operate as a substantial\n-11-\n\nAs noted in our prior discussion, Hellerstedt’s rendition of the undue burden\nstandard is fairly straightforward: it “requires that courts consider the burdens a law\nimposes on abortion access together with the benefits those laws confer.”  136 S. Ct.\nat 2309.  Indeed it emphasized there is “an independent constitutional duty to review\nfactual findings where constitutional rights are at stake.”  Id. at 2310 (internal\nquotation marks omitted).  Thus, Hellerstedt did not find, as a matter of law, that\nabortion was inherently safe or that provisions similar to the laws it considered would\nnever be constitutional.  Instead, it held that the “District Court applied the correct\nlegal standard” when it “weighed the asserted benefits against the burdens.”  Id.  The\ndistrict court here explicitly refused to “weigh[] the asserted benefits” stating that to\ndo so “would be impermissible judicial practice.”  \nIn light of Hellerstedt the district court erred in so ruling.  On remand, the\ndistrict court should, at the very least, weigh the state’s “asserted benefits.”  Despite\nthe district court’s assertions to the contrary, Hellerstedt’s analysis of the purported\nbenefits of the law at issue were, of course, related to what the law in that case\nregulated: abortion in Texas.  And so the Supreme Court recognized that “before the\nact’s passage, abortion in Texas was extremely safe.”  Id. at 2311 (emphasis added)\n(internal quotation marks omitted).8  \nobstacle to a woman’s choice to undergo an abortion.”  Planned Parenthood of Se. Pa.\nv. Casey, 505 U.S. 833, 895 (1992). \n8The district court observed that “Hellerstedt’s factual conclusions were not\nconfined to Texas” because the “majority relied on Wisconsin and Alabama case law\nand amicus briefs and materials unrelated to Texas.”  Hellerstedt cited other cases to\nshow that its “answer is consistent with the findings of the other Federal District\nCourts.” 136 S. Ct. at 2312.  It cited those cases after weighing the benefits put\nforward by Texas as a way to show that its own analysis was “consistent,” not\nsupported, by those of other courts.  In other words, Hellerstedt’s reliance on similar\ncases did not excuse courts from weighing any purported benefits as the district court\ndid here.  Additionally, while Hellerstedt may have cited sources from outside of\n-12-\n\nNo such determination about abortion in Missouri was made here.  Perhaps\nthere was a unique problem Missouri was responding to under its inherent “police\npower.”  See Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc., 501 U.S. 560, 569 (1991) (“The traditional\npolice power of the States is defined as the authority to provide for the public health,\nsafety, and morals.”).  Such a problem may require a different response than what was\nneeded in Texas, and the Hospital Relationship Requirement may be appropriate\ngiven “[Missouri’s] legitimate interest in seeing to it that abortion, like any other\nmedical procedure, is performed under circumstances that insure maximum safety for\nthe patient.”  Hellerstedt, 136 S. Ct. at 2309 (quoting Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113, 150\n(1973)).  Or perhaps the Hospital Relationship Requirement is consistent with a more\nexacting medical regulatory scheme than that present in Texas.  Cf. id. at 2315\n(finding Texas regulated procedures similar to abortion less heavily which undercut\nits safety argument).9  But, given no such inquiry was made—and no findings\nascertained—we remand for the district court to do that which Hellerstedt instructed:\n“consider[] the evidence in the record—including expert evidence, presented in\nstipulations, depositions, and testimony” and then “weigh[] the asserted benefits\nagainst the burdens.”  Id. at 2310.  \nIII.\nAs a final note, we address the 2010 Settlement Agreement.  To re-emphasize,\nonly one current plaintiff, Comprehensive Health, was a party to that agreement. \nWhether Comprehensive Health stays in the suit or not does not affect the disposition\nof this case.  RHS may properly maintain any of the remaining justiciable facial\nTexas, those sources informed the benefit/burden analysis of the Texas law at issue. \n9The district court made an attempt at some findings along these lines, but then\nsuggested “[t]he record is not clear enough . . . to make findings.”  \n-13-\n\nclaims on its own.10  The district court explicitly did not decide the issue.  While we\nnote the broad language in the release, we “decline to decide” in the first instance\n“whether the release language bars [Comprehensive Health’s] claims.”  Lynch v.\nNat’l Prescription Adm’rs, Inc., 787 F.3d 868, 874 (8th Cir. 2015).\nIV.\nFor the foregoing reasons, we vacate the preliminary injunction entered on May\n2, 2017 in its entirety and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.  \n______________________________\n10The same attorneys represent Comprehensive Health, RHS, and Yeomans in\nthis action.  Missouri does not press any argument on appeal that RHS is covered by\nthe 2010 Settlement.  \n-14-",

PRELIMINARY STATEMENT \n1.  This action for declaratory and injunctive relief is brought under the U.S. \nConstitution and 42 U.S.C. § 1983, to challenge Missouri restrictions that unconstitutionally \nCase 2:16-cv-04313-NKL   Document 1   Filed 11/30/16   Page 1 of 19\n\nburden access to abortion in the state. First, Plaintiffs challenge a Missouri statute, Mo. Ann. \nStat. § 197.200, that requires health centers that provide abortions to be licensed as ambulatory \nsurgical centers (“ASC Restriction”). Second, Plaintiffs challenge several separate requirements \nthat physicians who provide abortions must have various forms of hospital admitting privileges \nand/or a written transfer agreement with a nearby hospital, codified at Mo. Ann. Stat. § 197.215, \nMo. Code Regs. Ann. tit. 19, § 30-30.060, Mo. Ann. Stat. § 188.080, and Mo. Ann. Stat. § \n188.027(1)(1)(e) (collectively the “Hospital Relationship Restriction”). Both the ASC Restriction \nand the Hospital Relationship Restriction (together, “the Restrictions”) closely resemble Texas \nrestrictions recently invalidated by the U.S. Supreme Court in Whole Woman’s Health v. \nHellerstedt, 136 S.Ct. 2292 (2016), as revised (June 27, 2016), and like the ASC and admitting \nprivileges restrictions at issue in that case, they impose medically unnecessary requirements on \nhealth centers and physicians that provide abortions and unconstitutionally burden access to \nabortion in Missouri.  \n2.  The Restrictions severely restrict access to abortion in Missouri, which currently \nhas only one licensed abortion facility in the entire state, located in St. Louis, to serve the nearly \n1.2 million Missouri women of reproductive age. Plaintiffs have four additional health centers \nthat are prevented from providing abortion by the Restrictions, despite being able to safely do \nso.1 Women from all corners of Missouri, therefore, must currently travel up to 370 miles to \nobtain an in-state abortion.  \n3.  More specifically, Plaintiff Reproductive Health Services of Planned Parenthood \nof the Saint Louis Region (“RHS”) and its physicians would provide abortions at health centers \nlocated in Joplin and Springfield, Missouri, which currently offer family planning services, but \n                                                 \n1 State Facts About Abortion: Missouri, Guttmacher Institute, \nhttps://www.guttmacher.org/fact sheet/state facts about abortion missouri. \n2 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-04313-NKL   Document 1   Filed 11/30/16   Page 2 of 19\n\ncannot because of the Restrictions. Plaintiff Comprehensive Health of Planned Parenthood Great \nPlains (“Comprehensive Health”) and its physicians would provide abortions at health centers \nlocated in Kansas City and Columbia, Missouri, which currently offer family planning services, \nbut they cannot because of the Restrictions. Further, as detailed below, the Department of Health \nand Senior Services (“DHSS”) has a history of shifting its interpretation of the ASC Restriction \nas applied to the Columbia and Kansas City health centers in a way that creates a significant \nimpediment to these health centers complying with that restriction.  \n4.  The Restrictions irreparably injure Missouri women seeking abortion by \nthreatening their health, imposing medically unnecessary burdens on their constitutionally \nprotected right to obtain a pre-viability abortion, and in some cases depriving them of that right \naltogether. The Restrictions also injure Plaintiffs by preventing them from pursuing their \nbusinesses and professions and frustrating their missions to provide comprehensive reproductive \nhealth care to Missouri women.  \nII.  JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n5.  This Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1343. \n6.  Plaintiffs’ action for declaratory and injunctive relief is authorized by 28 U.S.C. \n§§ 2201 and 2202, by Rules 57 and 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and by the \ngeneral legal and equitable powers of this Court. \n7.  Venue in this Court is proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b) because a substantial part \nof the events giving rise to this action occurred in this district and because Defendants \nLyskowski and Koster, in their official capacities, reside in the Central Division of the Western \nDistrict of Missouri. \n \n3 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-04313-NKL   Document 1   Filed 11/30/16   Page 3 of 19\n\nIII.  PARTIES \nA.  Plaintiffs \n8.   Comprehensive Health is a not-for-profit corporation organized under the laws of \nKansas and registered to do business in Missouri. Comprehensive Health provides abortions at \ntwo health centers in Kansas and one health center in Oklahoma, and wishes to provide abortion \nservices at Planned Parenthood’s health centers in Columbia and Kansas City, Missouri, as it did \nin the past until it was prevented by the ASC and Hospital Relationship Restrictions. These \nhealth centers currently provide general reproductive health care, including family planning \nservices, testing and treatment for sexually transmitted infections, cervical and breast cancer \nscreening services, pregnancy testing, and all-options counseling. Plaintiff Comprehensive \nHealth sues on behalf of itself, its patients, physicians, and staff. \n9.  RHS is a not-for-profit corporation organized under the laws of Missouri. RHS \noperates a licensed abortion facility ASC in St. Louis and also provides medication abortions at a \nhealth center in Fairview Heights, Illinois. RHS wishes to offer abortion services at Planned \nParenthood health centers in Joplin and Springfield, Missouri. These health centers currently \nprovide general reproductive health care, including family planning services, testing and \ntreatment for sexually transmitted infections, cervical and breast cancer screening services, \npregnancy testing, and all-options counseling. Plaintiff RHS sues on behalf of itself, its patients, \nphysicians, and staff. \n10.  Plaintiff Ronald N. Yeomans is a board-certified physician specializing in \nobstetrics and gynecology with over 40 years experience. He provides abortions at \nComprehensive Health’s health centers in Overland Park, Kansas and Wichita, Kansas, and \n4 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-04313-NKL   Document 1   Filed 11/30/16   Page 4 of 19\n\nwishes to provide abortions at Planned Parenthood health centers in Missouri.

Stat. § 197.225. Director Lyskowski is sued in his official capacity, as are his employees, \nagents and successors. \n12.  Defendant Chris Koster is the Attorney General of the State of Missouri. As \nAttorney General, Defendant Koster is charged with enforcing Missouri’s ASCLL, and has \nspecific authority to seek injunctive and other relief for violations thereof. Mo. Ann. Stat. § \n197.235. Defendant Koster is sued in his official capacity, as are his employees, agents and \nsuccessors. \n13.  Defendant Daniel Knight is the Prosecuting Attorney for Boone County, \nMissouri, where the Columbia health center is located. He is authorized to prosecute violations \nof the Missouri criminal law, including violations of the ASCLL and the state’s criminal \nprohibition on physicians providing abortions without hospital admitting privileges. Defendant \nKnight is sued in his official capacity, as are his employees, agents and successors.  \n14.  Defendant Jean Peters Baker is the Prosecuting Attorney for Jackson County, \nMissouri, where the Kansas City health center is located. She is authorized to prosecute \nviolations of the Missouri criminal law, including violations of ASCLL and the state’s criminal \n5 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-04313-NKL   Document 1   Filed 11/30/16   Page 5 of 19\n\nprohibition on physicians providing abortions without hospital admitting privileges.

Defendant Dan Patterson is the Prosecuting Attorney for Greene County, \nMissouri, where the Springfield health center is located. He is authorized to prosecute violations \nof the Missouri criminal law, including violations of ASCLL and the state’s criminal prohibition \non physicians providing abortions without hospital admitting privileges. Defendant Patterson is \nsued in his official capacity, as are his employees, agents and successors.  \nIV.  FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \nA.  Abortion Background \n17.  Legal abortion is one of the safest procedures in contemporary medical practice. \nAbortion complications are exceedingly rare: nationwide, less than 0.3% of abortion patients \nexperience a complication that requires hospital treatment.  \n18.  There are two types of abortion, surgical abortion and medication abortion. In a \nsurgical abortion, instruments are used to remove the products of conception from the uterus. \nHowever, surgical abortion is not what is commonly understood as a surgical procedure, as it \ninvolves no incision and no general anesthesia. In medication abortion, patients are given \nmedications that cause the woman to expel the products of conception, similar to a miscarriage. \n6 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-04313-NKL   Document 1   Filed 11/30/16   Page 6 of 19\n\nPlaintiff RHS currently offers both surgical and medication abortion at its health center in St. \nLouis.  \n19.  Women seek abortions for a variety of reasons, including familial, medical, \nfinancial, and personal. Among other reasons, some women have abortions because they do not \nwant to start or add to their family at that time, some to preserve their life or their health, and \nsome because they have become pregnant as a result of rape. Some women who seek abortions \ndo so because the fetus has been diagnosed with a medical condition or anomaly. Approximately \none in three women in this country will have an abortion by age 45. Most women having \nabortions (61%) already have at least one child, and 66% plan to have children in the future. \nB.  ASC Restriction \n20.  Missouri’s ASCLL, Mo. Ann. Stat. § 197.200, requires that any facility “operated \nfor the purpose of performing . . . any second . . . trimester abortions or five or more first-\ntrimester abortions per month” be licensed as an ASC. Mo. Ann. Stat. § 197.200(1). The ASCLL \nalso requires that, in general, a medical facility must be licensed as an ASC when the facility is \n“operated primarily for the purpose of performing surgical procedures or… performing \nchildbirths.” Id.; Mo. Code. Regs. Ann. tit. 19 § 30-30.010(1)(b). Regulations implementing the \nASCLL define “primarily for the purpose of” to mean that at least 51% of the patients treated or \n51% of the revenues received were for a surgical procedure. Mo. Code. Regs. Ann. tit. 19 § 30-\n30.010(1)(b)(1). The ASCLL, therefore, singles out abortion as the only medical service for \nwhich the licensing requirement is triggered at five or more procedures per month (or one \nprocedure if it is a second trimester abortion). \n21.  Operation of an ASC without a license is a Class A misdemeanor. Mo. Ann. Stat. \n§ 197.235.  \n7 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-04313-NKL   Document 1   Filed 11/30/16   Page 7 of 19\n\n22.  The regulatory scheme in effect to implement the ASCLL has specific regulations \nfor abortion facility ASCs that establish, inter alia, detailed physical facility requirements, \nincluding procedure rooms with dimensions of at least twelve feet by twelve feet and a minimum \nceiling height of nine feet, patient corridors at least 6 feet wide, door widths at least 44” wide, \nand similarly specific requirements regarding facilities’ HVAC systems and finishes for ceilings, \nwalls, and floors, among others. See Mo. Code. Regs. Ann. tit. 19 § 30-30.070. While these \nrequirements were developed for newly constructed or significantly renovated facilities, DHSS \nhas taken the position that they apply to any health center seeking licensure to provide abortions. \nSee Planned Parenthood of Kansas v. Drummond, No. 07-4164-CV-C-ODS, 2007 WL 2811407, \nat *2 (W.D. Mo. Sept. 24, 2007). \n23.  The four health centers at which Plaintiffs wish to provide abortions do not meet \nthese physical facility requirements. For example, none have the specified corridor width, \ndoorway width, or ceiling height requirements.  \n24.  As the U.S. Supreme Court held in Whole Women’s Health, when it rejected \nTexas’s ASC restriction, requiring abortion facilities to meet these physical requirements “does \nnot benefit patients and is not necessary” because such requirements are inappropriate in the \ncontext of abortion. 136 S.Ct. at 2315.  \n25.  Surgical abortions can be safely performed in office-based settings, such as \ndoctors’ office and specialized clinics, and this is accepted medical practice nationally. There is \nno medical basis for requiring abortions to be performed in facilities that meet ASC \nrequirements. For example, the ASC requirements for the size of procedure rooms and recovery \nrooms, and the widths of corridors and doorways are unnecessary for the safe provision of \nabortion care, which involves only a small number of medical personnel and a small amount of \n8 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-04313-NKL   Document 1   Filed 11/30/16   Page 8 of 19\n\nequipment, and does not involve the use of deep sedation or general anesthesia. The excess space \nmandated by Missouri does not provide a health benefit to patients. In addition, some  \n of Missouri’s requirements, such as those related to scrub facilities, are geared toward \nmaintaining a sterile operating environment such as would be appropriate for a procedure \ninvolving an incision into a sterile bodily cavity. But surgical abortion is not a sterile procedure, \nbecause the provider accesses the patient’s uterus through the vagina, which is naturally \ncolonized by bacteria. Thus, physical facility requirements aimed at maintaining a sterile field \nare unnecessary and provide no medical benefit.  \n26.  Many procedures commonly performed in office-based settings are comparable to \nor riskier than surgical abortion, including gynecological procedures such as diagnostic dilation \nand curettage, hysteroscopy, surgical completion of miscarriage, colposcopy with cervical \nbiopsy, and loop electrosurgical excision of the cervix. Other non-gynecological procedures such \nas colonoscopy, many forms of plastic surgery, and dermatologic cancer surgery are comparable \nto or riskier than abortion. Indeed, some of these procedures are performed under general \nanesthesia, which, by itself, is much riskier than abortion. But, Missouri law does not require that \nfacilities in which these procedures are performed be licensed as ASCs unless they are operated \nprimarily for the purpose of performing surgical procedures.  \n27.  The ASC Restriction is particularly inappropriate in the context of medication \nabortion, which involves patients simply swallowing a pill in the health center. Patients then take \na second medication 24–48 hours later at a location of their choosing, most often at home, which \ncauses the expulsion of the contents of the uterus in a process similar to a miscarriage. \nComplications from medication abortion are extremely rare and only arise after a woman has \n9 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-04313-NKL   Document 1   Filed 11/30/16   Page 9 of 19\n\ngone home. There is no medical justification whatsoever for onerous physical facility \nrequirements for medication abortion.  \n28.  Indeed, DHSS has recognized that a health center can safely provide both surgical \nand medication abortion services without complying with these physical facility requirements. \nAs a result of a prior lawsuit, Planned Parenthood of Kansas and Mid-Missouri v. Drummond, \nNo. 07-4164-CV-C-ODS (W.D. Mo. 2007), DHSS entered into a settlement agreement allowing \nthe Columbia health center to be licensed by complying with a lesser (though still onerous and \nmedically unnecessary) set of physical facility requirements, for example approving smaller \ncorridor widths, lower ceiling heights, and smaller procedure room and counseling room areas \nthan those required by the ASCLL and its implementing regulations. As to the Kansas City \nhealth center, because it would offer only medication abortion and no surgical abortion or other \nform of surgery, DHSS agreed that it did not need to comply with the physical facility \nrequirements at all and additionally read out certain other inapplicable requirements.  \n29.  However, DHSS has repeatedly changed its position on what it will require under \nthe settlement agreement, and these shifting interpretations of the ASCLL’s medically irrelevant \nrequirements makes them a continuing impediment to abortion access in the state. For example, \nDHSS has recently informed Comprehensive Health that policies DHSS has approved in the past \nfor the Columbia and Kansas City health centers are no longer sufficient, a bathroom exhaust \nsystem in the Columbia facility that has been approved in the past is no longer sufficient, and \nthat the previously approved number of recliners in the recovery area is no longer sufficient.  \n30.  The Joplin and Springfield health centers are not parties to this settlement \nagreement, because they were not providing abortions at the time of the prior litigation. Thus, \nabsent injunctive relief from this Court, they are subject to the full obligations of the physical \n10 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-04313-NKL   Document 1   Filed 11/30/16   Page 10 of 19\n\nfacility and other requirements, which they, like the Columbia and Kansas City health centers, \nare unable to meet.  \nC.  Hospital Relationship Restriction \n31.  Missouri law contains several overlapping hospital relationship requirements. One \nof the ASCLL’s statutory licensing requirements for ASCs requires that surgical procedures may \nbe performed “only by physicians . . . who at the time are privileged to perform surgical \nprocedures in at least one licensed hospital in the community in which the ambulatory surgical \ncenter is located” or there must be a “current working agreement with at least one licensed \nhospital in the community in which the ambulatory surgical center is located, guaranteeing the \ntransfer and admittance of patients for emergency treatment.” Mo. Ann. Stat. § 197.215(2). The \nregulatory scheme for abortion facility ASCs similarly requires that “physicians performing \nabortions at [an abortion facility] have staff privileges at a hospital within fifteen (15) minutes’ \ntravel time from the facility or the facility shall show proof there is a working arrangement \nbetween the facility and a hospital within fifteen (15) minutes’ travel time from the facility \ngranting the admittance of patients for emergency treatment whenever necessary.” Mo. Code \nRegs. Ann. tit 19, § 30-30.060(1)(C)4. \n32.  In addition, Missouri law makes it a crime for a physician to provide an abortion \nwithout “clinical privileges at a hospital which offers obstetrical or gynecological care located \nwithin thirty miles of the location at which the abortion is performed.” Mo. Ann. Stat. § 188.080. \nViolation of this statute is a class A misdemeanor. The existence of this criminal statute makes it \npractically impossible for abortion facilities to utilize the ASCLL’s option of having a transfer \nagreement with a local hospital because, even if they are able to obtain such an agreement, the \n11 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-04313-NKL   Document 1   Filed 11/30/16   Page 11 of 19\n\nfacility’s physicians still would be unable to provide abortions unless they had local hospital \nprivileges.2   \n33.  As with the ASC Restriction, Missouri does not require facilities that perform \nprocedures other than abortion that are of comparable or higher risk to meet the Hospital \nRelationship Restriction unless the facility is operated primarily for the purpose of performing \nsurgical procedures.  \n34.  Plaintiffs are unable to meet the Hospital Relationship Restriction for the Kansas \nCity, Columbia, Joplin and Springfield health centers. Even though Comprehensive Health and \nRHS’s physicians who wish to provide abortion at these health centers hold hospital privileges, \nthey are unable to obtain hospital privileges within 15 minutes travel time from the facilities. \nSome hospitals, for political, ideological, or religious reasons, may be unwilling to grant \nadmitting privileges to physicians whose practice includes providing abortion services, or \nhospitals may refuse to grant, or even revoke, privileges as a result of anti-abortion political \npressure. For example, one of Comprehensive Health’s physicians had held privileges near the \nColumbia health center, but those privileges were revoked in late 2015 as a result of pressure \nfrom the Missouri Senate Interim Committee on the Sanctity of Life. See Planned Parenthood of \nKansas v. Lyskowski, No. 2:15-CV-04273-NKL, 2016 WL 2745873, at *2 (W.D. Mo. May 11, \n2016). \n35.  In addition, even if hospitals were willing to work with Comprehensive Health \nand RHS’s physicians, the physicians are unable to meet hospitals’ requirements for privileges \nbecause of the nature of their practices. Because abortion is extremely safe, and the need for \n                                                 \n2 In addition, Missouri’s informed consent for abortion law requires that patients be provided in \nwriting prior to the abortion information about the hospital “at which the physician performing or \ninducing the abortion has clinical privileges.” Mo. Ann. Stat. § 188.027(1)(1)(e). Violation of \nthis requirement is a class A misdemeanor. Mo. Ann. Stat. § 188.075. \n12 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-04313-NKL   Document 1   Filed 11/30/16   Page 12 of 19\n\nhospitalization is extremely rare, physicians who provide abortion do not admit patients to the \nhospital on a regular basis and so cannot meet hospitals’ requirements for proctoring or \nevaluation of their practice in the hospital setting. Many hospitals also require physicians to \nname a backup physician who already has privileges at the hospital and agrees to provide \ncoverage, but this requirement is impossible to meet because physicians are not willing to risk \nharassment or harm to their own practices from associating with a physician who provides \nabortion. In addition, Comprehensive Health’s and RHS’s physicians do not reside near the \nColumbia, Joplin or Springfield health centers and therefore cannot meet hospitals’ requirements \nthat privileged physicians reside within the hospital’s geographic service area or requirements \nthat physicians take emergency department call.  \n36.  Similarly, Comprehensive Health and RHS have been unable to obtain written \ntransfer agreements with any hospitals near the Kansas City, Joplin and Springfield health \ncenters, despite diligent efforts to request such an agreement from each and every hospital within \nthe communities of these health centers. Many of the eligible hospitals have either refused to \nrespond, or responded that no written transfer agreement is necessary, as they will treat any \npatients who need care in an emergency. \n37.  The Hospital Relationship Restriction is medically unnecessary in the context of \nabortion and does not provide a benefit to patients; on the contrary, it harms patients by \nrestricting access to abortion services in Missouri. As the U.S. Supreme Court found in Whole \nWomen’s Health, because abortion is “extremely safe,” there is a “virtual absence of any health \nbenefit” to requiring physicians who provide abortions to have hospital admitting privileges. 136 \nS.Ct. at 2311, 2313.  \n13 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-04313-NKL   Document 1   Filed 11/30/16   Page 13 of 19\n\n38.  Even though abortion is extremely safe, Plaintiffs are prepared to provide high \nquality care in the rare event of complications. In fact, most complications related to abortion are \nsafely and appropriately managed in the clinic setting. In the exceedingly rare case that a patient \nrequires hospital-based care, Plaintiffs’ protocols and practices ensure that the patient receives \nthe necessary care, consistent with the standard of practice.  \n39.  Complications from abortion are not only rare, but the few complications that do \noccur may not present until after a patient has left the health center. Plaintiffs provide their \npatients upon discharge with phone numbers to call if they experience complications or have \nconcerns at any time, day or night, after they have left the health center. In nearly all cases, the \npatients’ concerns or complications can be addressed over the phone by a qualified health care \nprofessional, or through a return visit to the clinic. In the rare instances where additional or after \nhours care is required, Plaintiffs’ staff will refer the patient to a local emergency room, as is also \nconsistent with the standard of care.  \n40.  In the exceedingly rare event that a patient needs to be transferred via ambulance \nfrom one of Plaintiffs’ health centers to a hospital, Plaintiffs’ policies and procedures ensure that \npatients receive appropriate care. Consistent with the recognized standard of care and to ensure \ncontinuity of care, Plaintiffs’ physicians will communicate with the emergency room physician \nand/or the on-call ob-gyn at the hospital where the patient is received, and those hospital \nphysicians will involve other physicians at the hospital as is necessary and appropriate. \n41.  Regardless of whether a physician has local hospital privileges or whether a \nfacility has a written transfer agreement with a hospital, appropriate care is ensured because \nhospitals provide necessary care to patients who need it. Indeed, hospitals must comply with the \nfederal Emergency Medical Treatment & Labor Act, which requires hospitals to treat and \n14 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-04313-NKL   Document 1   Filed 11/30/16   Page 14 of 19\n\nstabilize all emergency patients. 42 U.S.C. § 1395dd(b) (commonly referred to as EMTALA). In \nfact, each of the two hospitals near the Joplin health center and each of the two hospitals near the \nSpringfield health center have declined to enter into a transfer agreement with these health \ncenters because such an agreement is unnecessary, as they would treat any patients who needed \ncare in an emergency. \n42.  Even if a physician had local hospital privileges or a facility had a transfer \nagreement at a particular hospital, the facility’s patients may not go to that hospital. Patients \nexperiencing complications at home should seek treatment at their nearest hospital emergency \ndepartment. In addition, if a patient is transported by ambulance either from a health center or \nfrom home, paramedics may decide which hospital is closest or best suited for the patient’s needs \nregardless of which hospital the facility has a relationship with. Paramedics may also follow the \npatient’s preference based on her insurance or other concerns.  \n43.  The Hospital Relationship Restriction, therefore, does not increase patient safety \nand is medically unnecessary. \nD.  The Impact of the Restrictions \n44.  Plaintiffs and their patients are suffering ongoing irreparable injury as a result of \nthe ASC and Hospital Relationship Restrictions. \n45.  The Restrictions harm women’s health by restricting access to abortion to only \none abortion facility in the state of Missouri, in St. Louis. Women from all corners of Missouri \nmust currently travel to this facility to obtain an abortion in their home state.  \n46.  In some cases, women are unable to obtain abortions at all because of the lack of \naccess and the difficulty and expense of traveling a long distance to a provider. For other women, \nthe travel required increases the cost and logistical difficulty of reaching a provider and therefore \n15 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-04313-NKL   Document 1   Filed 11/30/16   Page 15 of 19\n\ndelays the abortion, as well as causing the woman to miss additional work, childcare, and other \nobligations; incur additional expenses; and, in some cases, jeopardize the confidentiality of her \npregnancy and/or abortion decision. Although abortion is one of the safest procedures in \ncontemporary medicine, the risk of complications (as well as the cost of the procedure) increases \nas the pregnancy advances. \n47.  The Restrictions therefore, irreparably harm Plaintiffs’ patients in two ways: \nthreatening the health of women seeking abortions, and depriving women of their \nconstitutionally protected right to obtain a pre-viability abortion. \n48.  The Restrictions also harm Plaintiffs by preventing them from pursuing their \nbusinesses and professions, frustrating their missions to provide comprehensive reproductive \nhealth care to Missouri women, and by depriving them of revenue they would otherwise be \nearning from providing abortion services. \n49.  Plaintiffs and their patients have no adequate remedy at law. \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nCOUNT I \n(Substantive Due Process – Right to Privacy – ASC Restriction) \n \n50.  Plaintiffs hereby reallege and incorporate by reference paragraphs 1 through 49 \nabove. \n51.  Missouri’s ASC Restriction violates Plaintiffs’ patients’ right to liberty and \nprivacy as guaranteed by the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. \nConstitution. It is an unnecessary health regulation that imposes an undue burden on women’s \nright to choose abortion.  \n \n \n16 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-04313-NKL   Document 1   Filed 11/30/16   Page 16 of 19\n\nCOUNT II \n(Substantive Due Process – Right to Privacy – Hospital Relationship Restriction) \n \n52.

Plaintiffs seek to be relieved from Missouri statutory and \nregulatory restrictions on abortion facilities as purported Ambulatory Surgical Centers (ASCs) \nand requiring nearby hospital affiliation for doctors performing abortions. Essentially plaintiffs \nask me to apply to Missouri last June’s ruling by the Supreme Court in a Texas case. Whole \nWoman’s Health v. Hellerstedt, 136 S.Ct. 2292 (2016) (Hellerstedt). \n  Suit is pending against State defendants, the new Attorney General, Joshua D. Hawley, \nand Dr. Randall Williams, the new Director of the Missouri Department of Health and Senior \nServices (HSS). Also defendants (Local Defendants) are the Prosecuting Attorneys of Boone, \nJackson, Greene and Jasper Counties, where abortion services (medicinal and physically \n                                           \n The caption of the case is revised to reflect substitution of parties. Doc. 67. \nCase 2:16-cv-04313-BCW   Document 68   Filed 03/10/17   Page 1 of 7\n\nperformed procedures) are in question. The Local Defendants have taken differing positions and \nare not involved in the current motion to dismiss filed by the State Defendants. Doc. 26. \n  Defendants’ briefing argues that (1) the claims are not “ripe” for adjudication because \nthere has allegedly been no application for clinician privileges at pertinent hospitals, and there \nhas been no application to HSS for a waiver or deviation from any particular ASC requirements \n(under authority of 19 CSR 30-30.070(1)), (2) the Kansas City organization is subject to a 2010 \nSettlement Agreement pertaining to a Columbia, Mo. facility, and (3) there are allegedly \nuncorrected deficiencies for existing facilities that would prevent abortion use regardless of the \nvalidity of the challenged laws. Doc. 27. \n  Some of the defendants’ points relate to the ultimate merits and to possible limitations on \nequitable relief. The primary issue that relates to jurisdictional ripeness is whether HSS and \nhospitals are presently entitled to time off from litigation to consider various applications for \nparticular deviations that are not now pending. \n  The ripeness issue regarding failure to apply for hospital privileges at nearby hospitals, \nbefore seeking judicial assistance here, would require doctors like plaintiff Yeomans to make \napplications that they contend are unwanted and unnecessary, and very probably unavailable, as \nruled in Hellerstedt. No pertinent authority having been cited for such a delaying requirement, it \nseems rather ludicrous on its face. The merits of the hospital affiliation issue should be ruled, as \nwas done in the Texas case. \n  A good deal more plausible, at least superficially, is the contention that some problems \nregarding the layout and physical features of proposed abortion facilities might be resolved by \nCase 2:16-cv-04313-BCW   Document 68   Filed 03/10/17   Page 2 of 7\n\ngoing to the Department (HSS) and requesting what the regulation refers to as “deviations.”1 The \nState Defendants are suggesting that even though they resist discontinuing ASC rules as a \npackage they might be persuaded to reduce or substitute some of the details, perhaps important \nones, if only the organizations would formally seek deviations. \n  But plaintiffs contend that physically-performed abortions are simply misclassified as \nsurgical, as determined in June by the Supreme Court in the Texas case, and that, as in Texas, \nthey should be free of ASC rules as a package. Extensive briefing by the State Defendants shows \nthey remain committed to enforce the ASC package, and any blanket request such as contained \nin the complaint here would be rejected.2 It would be futile to hold plaintiffs to making a formal \nrequest now for relief from ASC status, as required by statute (§ 198.200 RSMo). Thus, the \npleaded controversy is plainly ripe on that issue. Whether I should divert plaintiffs from \npresenting the current case, where a preliminary injunction hearing is scheduled this month, and \nrequire them to seek deviations from lesser obligations is the question the State Defendants are \nadvancing. \n  By invoking the law of ripeness, the litigants rely on guidance from an opinion by Justice \nHarlan in 1967. Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner, 387 U.S. 136. The basic points to be considered \nare “fitness of the issues for judicial review and the hardship to the parties of withholding court \nconsideration.” Id. at 149. Fitness refers to institutional questions presented when “premature \nadjudication is in prospect,” thus “entangling” the courts in “abstract disagreements over \nadministrative policies.” Id. at 148. The court should, when appropriate, “protect the agencies \nfrom judicial interference …” Id. \n                                           \n1 The parties will understand that this refers to such things as sprinkler systems and authorizing “wall-mounted \nsurgical light and gooseneck light” rather than “ceiling-mounted surgical light,” as provided in the Settlement \nAgreement of 2010 relating to the Center in Columbia. \n2 Some of this may have occurred before suit was filed. Study of such activities has not been deemed necessary. \nCase 2:16-cv-04313-BCW   Document 68   Filed 03/10/17   Page 3 of 7\n\n  Ripeness is a judge-made rule, to be used pragmatically, that is, with a sense of what may \nwork, as well as giving parties, agencies and other governmental officials a fair opportunity to \nresolve questions that may ultimately relieve the courts of the necessity of ruling. \n  Here we have important guidance from the Supreme Court in the Texas case. It ruled on \nthe invalidity of the hospital privileges requirement and the bad fit between regulation of surgical \nsafety problems and the activities of an abortion clinic. The Court also rejected defendant’s \nrequest for judicially engaging in severance – working through the package to determine which \nportions reasonably apply to abortion clinics. Hellerstedt, supra, 136 S.Ct.  at 2319-20. The Court \nruled that proceeding in “piecemeal fashion” would verge on judicial legislation. Giving broad \nguidance to the parties but not detailed review of specific issues is best suited for the courts. This \nis exactly what plaintiffs seek now, and Hellerstedt assumes that with such guidance abortion \nproviders and patient-safety regulators may then be able to work together for detailed solutions. \n  Requiring applications for deviations now without guidance beyond what Hellerstedt \narguably gives would predictably resolve little or nothing. Each party would stand on divergent \ntheories about Hellerstedt, as presented in the preliminary injunction briefing. Advising the \nparties promptly whether or not the ASC package of regulations applies in Missouri would give \nthem necessary guidance. If I would hold plaintiffs to compliance with statutory ASC status, \ntheir requests to HSS might be minimal, or at least greatly reduced. If I would rule that the Texas \ncase controls, and the statutory classification cannot be used, the State Defendants would be \nmore likely to work with plaintiffs to regulate in a manner that preserves abortion-patient safety \nin the least demanding manner that would be reasonable.3 \n                                           \n3I am quite aware of political issues and questions of conscience which make difficult  any prediction that the parties \nmay be able to work things out on their own. Judge Laughrey has referred to “political pressure or public \nopposition” as well as perceived danger to the budget of HSS in the event of such cooperation. Planned Parenthood \nof Kansas and Mid-Missouri, Inc. v. Lyskowski, 2015 WL 9463198 *1 (W.D.Mo.). A more recent published \nCase 2:16-cv-04313-BCW   Document 68   Filed 03/10/17   Page 4 of 7\n\n  To dismiss now, on a theory of unripeness, would increase rather than reduce the \nlikelihood of undesirable institutional interference and would be counterproductive on the fitness \nissue. Abbott Laboratories points toward denial of the motion. \n  The second prong of Abbott Laboratories relates to hardship comparison if the \ncontroversy were delayed in the interest of negotiation. My supposition is that a dismissal or stay \nmight delay the case for a year. Plaintiffs would tender applications they realize would be denied \nif Hellerstedt is deemed inapplicable, as the State Defendants do. After perhaps several months \nof futile attempts to negotiate, the litigation would be resumed, but with the complication that \nspecific physical issues would be litigated, contrary to the hope expressed by the Supreme Court. \nThe controversy about such details, if deemed to take priority over what plaintiffs seek now, \nwould surely take months. Meanwhile, the principal victims would be women seeking \nabortions.4 \n  The second prong of Abbott Laboratories also favors denying the motion.  \n  For a trial judge, the ripeness issue as presented is somewhat similar to a request for \ncontinuing a scheduled hearing or argument for purposes of negotiation. Except for the formality \nof triggering events by handing defendants a piece of paper, that is what seems to be involved. \nEven if defendants were begging to negotiate, my sense of what could be accomplished would \nnot favor delay, and harm from delay clearly outweighs the likely benefit. If defendants really \nwant to end this dispute quickly, and feel free to do so on reasonable terms favorable to opening \n                                                                                                                                        \nstatement from a newly elected State Senator recites “I don’t like abortion. I want it out of the state … One avenue is \nregulation.” Jason Hancock article, Kansas City Star, Dec. 1, 2016. To the extent such attitudes affect HSS it may \nseem improbable that judicial immersion in regulatory details can be avoided. But prospects would be better with \ngeneral guidance than by forcing plaintiffs now into making formal applications for deviations and into negotiations \nwithout mutual understanding of the applicable law. \n \n \n4 Under current law we cannot consider as a benefit the lives that might be preserved by delaying a considerable \nnumber of early abortions. Judges and counsel cannot properly be influenced by sentiment contrary to law. Perhaps \nin future years the tables will be turned, or perhaps not. \nCase 2:16-cv-04313-BCW   Document 68   Filed 03/10/17   Page 5 of 7\n\nabortion clinics, the days before the scheduled argument might suffice, assuming plaintiffs also \nare willing to agree on terms providing reasonable safety for abortion patients. Exercising \ndiscretion, a continuance would be denied. \n  The briefing of the parties fails to focus on issues of ripeness in abortion cases. They are \nsufficiently numerous so that they might have produced a body of precedent on this subject if it \nhad been litigated. No abortion case known to me would support a ripeness impediment here. All \nlitigation of which I am aware goes forward to announce legal rules, as was done, e.g., in \nPlanned Parenthood of Minnesota/South Dakota v. Rounds, 372 F.3d 969 (8th Cir. 2004). There \nis not much guidance from other ripeness litigation in which general principles are applied, but \nthe situations fail to resemble what we are dealing with. \n  The other issue emphasized in the motion to dismiss is the Settlement Agreement of \n2010. As plaintiffs point out, the agreement resolved a dispute that went to Judge Smith \nregarding certain physical requirements for patient safety at the Columbia Center but did not \nquestion ASC status. It concerned only one plaintiff, the Kansas City organization. The motion \nthus could not result in the dismissal of the case brought by two other parties who were not \ninvolved. As the D.C. Circuit has observed, “The defense that the settlement agreement bars \n(plaintiff’s) suit is substantive, not jurisdictional.” Saksenasingh v. Secretary of Education, 126 \nF.3d 347 (D.C.Cir. 1997). It is premature to deal with what, if any, effect the agreement may \nhave here. \n  There are other questions raised, such as possible independent grounds for preventing \nopening of the Columbia Center for abortion procedures or a possible breach of contract claim \nagainst the Kansas City organization (or perhaps a bar to equitable relief sought by that party). \nCase 2:16-cv-04313-BCW   Document 68   Filed 03/10/17   Page 6 of 7\n\nThese issues also relate to the merits of the case or possible conditions on equitable relief. We \nare not there at this time. \n  The motion to dismiss (Doc. 26) is therefore DENIED.  \n  /s/ Howard F. Sachs  _______________                              \n  HOWARD F.

They  ask  for  relief  from  two  varieties  of  statutory  and \nregulatory restriction, imposing (1) a hospital admitting privileges requirement on \ndoctors and (2) an ambulatory surgical center (ASC) requirement on clinics.   The \nchallenges here are designed to invoke successful challenges in Texas.  Whole \nWoman’s  Health  v.  Hellerstedt,  136  S.  Ct  2292  (2016).    The  Missouri  State \ndefendants,  Attorney  General  Hawley  and  Director  Williams,  newly  appointed \nexecutive of the Department of Health and Senior Services, resist judicial relief, \nadopting positions asserted by the previous State Administration.  \n  Since the restrictions were imposed in 2007, abortion facilities in Missouri \n[1] \n \n\nhave been intermittently confined geographically.  At present, only St Louis has an \noperating  facility.    Abortion  clinics  in  Overland  Park,  Kansas,  and  Fayetteville, \nArkansas, are used by some Missourians.  Central Missouri lacks ready access to \nsuch facilities and the Springfield - Joplin area is notably unserved.     \n  This  is  not  a  contest  over  abortion  rights  as  such.    All  parties  must \nacknowledge that, until viability of a fetus, pregnant women and girls have had, for \nmore  than  forty  years,  constitutionally  protected  rights  to  obtain  abortions.  The \nchallenged restrictions were imposed purportedly as health measures for abortion \npatients.  Both  restrictions  are  said  by  plaintiffs  to  be  unnecessary,  useless, \nburdensome  or  impossible  to  achieve,  so  much  so  that  they  have  been  called \nTargeted  Regulation  of  Abortion  Provider  laws  (TRAP  legislation).    The  Texas \nrestrictions, challenged here, were so characterized in Justice Ginsburg’s concurring \nopinion in Hellerstedt, 136 S.Ct. at 2321. As noted in my ruling denying dismissal of \nthis case, “targeted regulation” is not an unknown concept in Missouri.  An incoming \nState Senator was recently quoted as advocating regulation as “one avenue” to \nwholly eliminate abortions in Missouri. (Doc. 68, p. 5). \n  The  Missouri  State  defendants  contend,  however,  that  the  surgical  center \nrequirement can be justified as a health measure, that closed centers have not been \nstatistically  shown  to  reduce  the  rate  of  abortions,  and  that  the  hospital  affiliation \nrequirements  are  both  reasonable  and  achievable,  as  in  St.  Louis.      The  State \ndefendants further contend that the hospital affiliation requirement, invalidated by the \nSupreme Court, can be defended here because Missouri is more compact than Texas \nand they have new evidence of reasonableness not presented in the Texas case.  With \n[2] \n \n\nrespect to the surgical center  requirement, although there is a statute specifying that \nabortion  clinics  shall  be  classified  as  Ambulatory  Surgical  Centers  (§  197.200(1) \nR.S.Mo.), there is a regulation in Missouri (19-CSR 30.30.070(1)), but allegedly not in \nTexas, allowing relief through deviations granted by the Department.1  The Department \nhas allowed grandfathering of some surgical facilities that do not comply. The abortion \nclinic  in  Kansas  City  has  been  exempted  by  the  Department  when  only  medicinal \nabortions have been proposed.  And the Columbia facility has negotiated for some \nmodifications in the regulatory requirements, although it required a lawsuit before this \nwas achieved in 2010 and since that time there have been a number of disputes and \nalleged changes of position by the Department.     \n  For  reasons  discussed  below,  I  am  granting  a  preliminary  injunction  against \nenforcing the hospital affiliation requirement (§ 197.215(2) R.S. Mo.; 188.080 R.S.Mo.; \n188.027.1(1)( e) R.S. Mo.; and  regulation 19-30-060 (1)( c)(4))  for doctors performing \nabortions.  The Texas case clearly controls that ruling.   I  am  also  granting  a  preliminary \ninjunction against using the surgical center requirement, as the Supreme Court did, where \nthe statutory and regulatory pattern is similar to that in Missouri.   Even if we assume the \nregulation permits the Director to disregard mandatory language of the statute and to use \n“physical facility” regulations no more onerous than are used for procedures performed in \ntypical medical and dental offices, the surgical center rules have not been withdrawn by the \nDepartment during the months after the Texas ruling, and the new Director’s filings here \nbelie the prospect of his granting relief voluntarily. The principal argument of the State \ndefendants  is  that,  contrary  to  the  conclusions  of  the  Supreme  Court,  abortions  are \nsufficiently  dangerous  to  pregnant  women  so  that  surgery  center  requirements  are \n                                                      \n1 The Hellerstedt majority noted, however, that “full or partial waivers” are possible in \nTexas.  136 S.Ct. at 2308.  \n[3] \n \n\nappropriate.  Thus it would be fruitless to await regulation relief.  \n  Moreover, taking into account the highly contentious political status of abortions, it \nwould take a very hardy Director, even if not personally opposed to pre-viability abortion \nrights, to agree voluntarily to establishment of abortion clinics in Springfield or Joplin that \nwould be out of compliance with ASC standards.  I am therefore satisfied that plaintiffs \nshould have relief from such standards, as the Supreme Court mandated, and that relief \nshould be prompt, given the needs of women seeking abortions and the need for available \nclinics to serve their needs.    Without the guidance of a favorable ruling here it seems \ninevitable that the establishment of new clinics would be unduly delayed.2    \n \n1.  Hellerstedt Controls \n  Filings of the parties have added voluminous material to the record, largely directed \ntoward the issue of dangerousness of abortions. Surgery center requirements are needed \nfor safety, according to the State Defendants. (Doc. 84). Plaintiffs argue, correctly I believe, \nthat because the Supreme Court has spoken on this subject I am required to follow.  The \nCourt  noted  that  childbirth  has  a  mortality  rate  14  times  that  of  abortions,  and  that \ncolonoscopies, for example, have a mortality rate 10 times higher.  136 S.Ct. at 2315.  The \nCourt found that “in the face of no threat to women’s health” Texas unreasonably required \nthem to travel to distant surgery centers, “superfacilities.” Id. at 2318.  There were three \ndissenters, two of whom filed outspoken opinions, but the dissenters did not take issue \nwith the majority on the question of abortion safety.  In that respect, the ruling was 5 to \nzero. \n                                                      \n2 The Texas decision expresses the hope that details of clinic design and requirements \nwill not become judicial issues.  Thus, I should go as far, but not farther, than the \nSupreme Court did in rejecting surgery center requirements as a package.    \n[4] \n \n\n  For me to accept new material, copies of studies and expert opinions, and to find a \ngreater safety problem than was found in Hellerstedt, would be impermissible judicial \npractice.    Lower  court  judges  are  bound  by  Supreme  Court  precedent  even  if  they \nseriously question what the Court has done.  MKB Management Corp. v. Stenehjem, 795 \nF.3d 768 (8th Cir. 2015). The lower federal courts cannot second-guess the Supreme Court \nregarding “underlying facts.” Id. at 772.  Defendants cite no authority for what they ask, \nalthough  they  observe  that  the  Missouri  Supreme  Court  did  reappraise    the  issue  of \nteenage capital punishment in advance of the High Court’s ruling in Roper v Simmons, 543 \nU.S. 551 (2005). Although the Court majority agreed with the Missouri Supreme Court, \nJustice  O’Connor’s  dissent  criticized  the  Missouri  Court’s  practice,  saying  it  was  her \nCourt’s “prerogative alone to overrule one of its precedents.” She cited  State Oil Co. v. \nKhan, 522 U.S. 3, 20 ( 1997). \n  The State Defendants’ contention that I should reappraise the abortion safety issue, \nafter the very extensive advocacy on both sides in Hellerstedt, would be like attempting to \nundermine Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483 (1954), based on a Missouri school \ndistrict contention that the effect of segregation was better understood in Plessy than in the \nBrown case, or that racial segregation in Missouri is more benign than elsewhere.   \n  Hellerstedt’s factual conclusions were not confined to Texas. The majority relied on \nWisconsin and Alabama case-law (136 S.Ct. at 2312) and amicus briefs and materials \nunrelated to Texas.  It is of course true that Hellerstedt, like Roe v. Wade, might someday  \nmeet the fate of  Plessy v. Ferguson, but only the Supreme Court could reach that result.  \nThe filings are of interest, and have been studied to the extent feasible and appropriate, \n[5] \n \n\nbut cannot support a ruling inconsistent with Hellerstedt.3   \n \n2. Hospital Affiliation Requirement \n  Various Missouri statutes, including criminal prohibitions, mandate that a doctor \ncannot perform an abortion in a clinic unless he or she has hospital privileges at a \nnearby hospital, within 30 miles of the clinic.  Regulations tighten the requirement to \ndistances within fifteen minutes of the clinic, which raises questions regarding Kansas \nCity.   \n  In Hellerstedt, however, the Supreme Court found “no significant health-related \nproblem that the new (hospital affiliation) law helped to cure.” 136 S.Ct. at 2311. At oral \nargument in the Supreme Court Texas counsel acknowledged that he could not cite “a \nsingle instance in which the new requirement would have helped even one woman \nobtain better treatment.”  Id. at 2311-12. The Court noted that similar admitting-privileges \nlaws in Wisconsin and Alabama had been ruled useless, from a health standpoint.  The \nCourt  also  found  the  requirement  disabling  for  almost  all  abortion  practitioners  for \nvarious reasons unrelated to competency, and places a “’substantial obstacle in the path \nof a woman’s choice.’“ Id.  at 2312 (citing the plurality opinion in Casey, 505 U.S. at \n877).  The Court also reviewed the closing of clinics, apparently caused by the absence \n                                                      \n3 Taking the liberty indulged in by the MKB judges, I am struck by a considerable \nincrease in danger in the immediate weeks before viability. “Abortion-Related Mortality” \narticle (2004) by Linda A. Bartlett (Doc. 86-2, p. 9).  This reaffirms the view of the \nHellerstedt majority that abortions in the earlier weeks are extremely safe, but does \ncreate  possible  questions  concerning  the  final  several  weeks  before  viability.    The \ncategory of risk at that later time may still be considered very low – perhaps somewhat \ncloser to childbirth and colonoscopies.  Studies that do not separately analyze these two \ndivergent  periods  of  pregnancy  may  seem  defective.    Since  the  great  majority  of \nabortions  occur  many  weeks  before  viability  this  observation  seems  to  confirm  the \npractice mandated by Hellerstedt, but would leave for further study appropriate health \nregulations during the last few weeks.  \n[6] \n \n\nof doctors who could meet the affiliation requirement. Without confining its appraisal to \nTexas, the Court ruled that “the admitting-privileges requirement does not serve any \nrelevant credentialing function.”   Id. at 2313.   \n  Hellerstedt also discussed the burden that closing of convenient clinics has on \npersons seeking abortions.  From the record in that case it recited that many tens of \nthousands of women would be forced to travel more than 150 miles to find an open clinic \nif seeking an abortion, and a great number would travel over 200 miles. It is true that   \nincreased driving distance does not “always” constitute an “undue burden,” as noted in \nCasey, but the Hellerstedt Court said the “the virtual absence of any health benefit” from \nthe hospital affiliation requirement was a factor to be weighed in making an undue \nburden ruling. Id. at 2313. Balancing is therefore required. Id at 2309.  This necessarily \nmeans that the burden to be considered undue is greatly reduced as a requirement as \nthe benefit from the regulation becomes miniscule, if any. West Alabama Women’s \nCenter v. Miller, 2016 WL 6395904, *4 (M.D. Ala.) (and citations). \n  In Casey a waiting period was ruled to be an appropriate benefit to society, like a \nwaiting period before a serious act comparable to marriage.  Nothing like that benefit \nexists here.  Minimization of the distance-burden issue is dramatized by the Court’s \nholding that forcing El Paso residents to travel to New Mexico was invalid when the \nsurgical center requirement was deemed of slight if any value.  Id. at 2304.  Although the \nCourt was not explicit, I doubt that the state line crossing was the most critical aspect of \nthe ruling.4   In the abortion context, unlike professional education, a state line has little \n                                                      \n4 Members of the Court would have been aware that Las Cruces, New Mexico, is quite \nnear El Paso (less than 50 miles), and if abortion facilities were not presently available \nthere the provision of such facilities in Las Cruces, as in other sites in New Mexico, \npresumably would be feasible. If traveling 150 miles is an acceptable burden in waiting \n[7] \n \n\npractical significance. \n     This case is not a close one in any event, as the absence of a clinic in Central \nMissouri requires hundreds of miles of travel, round-trip, with two trips needed unless a \nwoman has the means and time available for a long stay in St. Louis or other rather \ndistant  clinics.    Compare  the  excessive  travel  burden  for  women  in  Tuscaloosa, \ndiscussed in West Alabama, supra, * 9.  The lesson of Hellerstedt thus requires an \nundue burden conclusion when, as here, major travel is needed, because the hospital \naffiliation requirement has made it practically impossible to continuously staff an abortion \nclinic in Columbia.   \n  Defendants  make  an  argument,  based  on  some  statistical  curiosities,  that  the \nreduced number of clinics may have minimal effect on the number of recorded abortions.  \nCounsel concedes, candidly and commendably, that his contention is “counter-intuitive.”  \nPlaintiffs have offered the contrary declaration of Dr. Sheila Katz, convincingly stating \nsociological realties consistent with what can be judicially noticed. (Doc. 15-5).  Not \nclaiming expertise in statistics, I can suppose the major fallacy of the statistics relied on \n(which are inconsistent with other statistics)5 is that they are generally State-wide in \nnature, not focused on a major area of concern, such as Central Missouri. A fall-off in \nprofessionally-handled abortions in a locale seems almost certain when there is no \n                                                                                                                                                                           \nperiod cases I would suppose implicit in the Hellerstedt ruling would be a supposition \nthat a 50 mile trip is an excessive burden for restrictions which confer little or no benefit.    \n5  As  one  might  expect,  the  statistical  argument  seems  to  be  contrary  to  a  study \npublished  in  January  in  the  Journal  of  the  American  Medical  Association  and  a \nResearch Brief at the University of Texas, deposited in February, which tend to show a \nsignificant drop-off in reported abortions when travel distance to clinics is increased by \n25 miles, and a much more notable drop when distances are increased as much as \noccurs when the Columbia, Missouri facility is closed.  Grossman, White, Hopkins & \nPotter (2017) Change in distance to nearest facility and abortion in Texas, 2012 to \n2014, JAMA 317, 437-439; Grossman, White, Hopkins & Potter, J.E. (2017);  How \ngreater travel distance due to clinic closures reduced access to abortion in Texas. PRC \nResearch Brief 2(2). (Doc. 86-6).     \n[8] \n \n\nconvenient  place  to  go.  In  that  sense  the  hospital  affiliation  requirement  probably \ncreates health hazards for women.  No one has rebutted Dr. Katz regarding human \nbehavior expectations.  \n  In oral argument, the State defendants’ counsel argued against a state-wide \ninjunction if the travel burden was imposed mostly harmfully on women living in central \nMissouri (Doc. 78, p. 52). Apparently he was asking that the court limit relief to a circle \nof counties with boundaries established somewhat arbitrarily by the court.   No authority \nis cited for such a limitation of relief.  It would compromise the difference between a \nfacial challenge like this one and an “as applied” challenge.  Hellerstedt imposed state-\nwide relief and I am bound to do so here. If anything, the area of impact here covers \nmore of the State of Missouri than occurred in Texas. The dissent by Justice Alito refers \nto the point advocated for defendants here and failed to persuade a majority of the \nCourt. 136 S.Ct. at 2349-2350. \n \n3.  Arkansas Case \nThe second authority that has a bearing on the result here is the pending decision by \na panel of the Eighth Circuit in the argued and submitted case, Planned Parenthood of \nArkansas  v.  Jegley,  No.  16-2234.    On  appeal  is  Judge  Baker’s  ruling  in  Planned \nParenthood of Arkansas & Eastern Oklahoma v.  Jegley, 2016 WL 6211310 (E.D. Ark.). \nThe trial and opinion below preceded Hellerstedt, and reached the same result on \npreliminary injunction, invalidating a requirement slightly less onerous than the hospital \naffiliation requirement here and in Hellerstedt.   Arkansas had a “contracted physician \nrequirement”  rather  than  a  direct  hospital  affiliation  requirement.    As  very  plausibly \n[9] \n \n\nfound  by  Judge  Baker,  the  Arkansas  statute  was  both  unnecessary  and  close  to \nprohibitory in its result, essentially for reasons later stated in Hellerstedt. While that may \nbe a slightly more difficult case than this one (and of course required a great deal more \nwork), I agree with the opinion and result.  If affirmed by the Circuit, that would seem to \nrequire invalidation of Missouri’s hospital affiliation requirement.6          \n \n4. Ambulatory Surgical Center Requirement  \n  Abortion  clinics  in  Missouri  are  currently  required  by  statute  to  comply  with \nrequirements imposed for Ambulatory Surgical Centers (ASCs); that is, they must have \nfacilities suitable for significant surgery.  Wide hallways are notably required, to facilitate \nmoving  of  still  unconscious  patients  lying  on  gurneys.    Requirements  are  imposed \nbecause of special sterilization needs of patients undergoing incisions.   Normal medical \nand dental office facilities, with strict cleanliness requirements, cubicles for medical \nprocedures, limited staffing requirements, etc. are not considered adequate for ASCs. \nAbortion clinic objections to ASC status are founded on the very considerable cost of \ncompliance – perhaps $3 million for either remodeling or building new clinics – and the \nlack of need because of the absence of incisions, the use of limited anesthetics rather \nthan general anesthesia or deep sedation, and the modesty of the procedures used.  It \nhas  been  repeatedly  asserted  by  plaintiffs’  counsel,  without  contradiction,  that  first \n                                                      \n6  A  procedural  quirk  in  Jegley  is  that  plaintiffs  sued  two  prosecutors  to  prevent \nenforcement of the Arkansas law, and the district judge also enjoined them “from failing \nto notify immediately all state officials responsible for enforcing the requirements.”   \n[10] \n \n\ntrimester abortions, the bulk of abortion clinic activity, generally take four to five minutes \nto complete.7   \n  The statute, enforced according to its terms, would require the Kansas City clinic \nto gird itself with the full panoply of ASC features even though medicinal abortions are \nexclusively  used  in  Kansas  City.    This  is  one  area  of  abortion  regulation  where \nexemptions have been granted in the past, but the future is unpredictable, with a new \nDirector subject to political pressure from abortion opponents in the General Assembly \nand elsewhere, and the unqualified mandatory statute remaining on the books.   \n  Hellerstedt invalidated the entire ASC package of restrictions for abortion clinics \nin Texas, without evaluating specific requirements.  136 S.Ct. at 2314-2318.  An undue \nburden of costliness, when balanced against benefits, is clearly imposed in Springfield \nand Joplin according to the lesson of Hellerstedt. 8  \n  The lack of necessity and “nearly arbitrary” imposition of ASC requirements, as \nfound in Hellerstedt (136 S.Ct. at 2316), adequately establishes that these plaintiffs are \nvery likely to receive relief.  There has also been some debating and inquiry about \n                                                      \n7 It will perhaps have been noted that the background facts in this case are essentially \nuncontroverted  at  this  time.  The  disputed  issues  regarding  safety  and  the  alleged \nbenefits of ASC and hospital affiliation requirements have been presented by expert \ndeclarations and published studies. They need not be dealt with, I conclude, because \ncontrolled by Hellerstedt.   \n \n8 The focus has now shifted to Southern Missouri, where abortion clinics would be made \navailable under the auspices of the St. Louis organization.  The St. Louis clinic itself \nsatisfies ASC requirements and was described by defendants’ counsel as “the safest \nthe state can make an abortion facility.” (Doc. 78, p. 46).  The Columbia clinic has been \nmodeled under the Settlement Agreement of 2010, but is crippled by the absence of \ndoctors with hospital affiliations.  The Kansas City clinic has been operational in the \npast, but the facilities there and in Columbia reportedly have some minor physical \nissues before licensing.  Those are not my concern, at least at this time.  The \nDepartment is free to use any normal, nondiscriminatory licensing and inspection \nactivities.   \n[11] \n \n\nwhether abortion clinics in Missouri are the victims of discriminatory treatment, by being \nrequired to provide accommodations and facilities not required for medical procedures \nof a comparable nature.  The record is not clear enough on some points to make \nfindings. I note, however, that I still have questions about whether miscarriage treatment \nand  intrusive  gynecological  examinations,  which  both  seem  similar  to  abortions, \nparticularly early term abortions, are subject to ASC requirements. Colonoscopies have \nASC requirements where they constitute more than 50% of a medical practice.  But if \nfour  and  five  minute  first  trimester  abortions  could  not  be  fairly  characterized  as \nsignificant  surgery  (what  used  to  be  called  “operations”),    that  would    require  all \nabortions  to  be  exempted,  since  those  early  term  abortions  constitute  the  bulk  of \nabortion practice  in the St. Louis clinic,  and presumably elsewhere under the same \nauspices.  It would surely be an invidious discrimination against abortion clinics if the \n50% rule used for other procedures were not used in that context. Yet the statute is \noperable when there are only five first term abortions. On this issue see footnote 9, \ninfra.   \n \n5. Miscellaneous Issues \nA.  Preliminary Injunction requirements \nThe familiar requirements for a preliminary injunction, as set forth in Dataphase \nSystems Inc. v.  CL Systems Inc., 640 F.2d 109 (8th Cir. 1981) are easily met in this \ncase. The issues include a plaintiff’s probability of success and irreparable injury absent \nthe injunction.  The court must also consider harm to other interested parties if the relief \nis granted, and factor in the effect on the public interest.  In this case, because of \n[12] \n \n\nHellerstedt and plaintiffs shaping their claim on that controlling case, their likelihood of \nsuccess is very high.  The ability to function as abortion clinics and to perform abortions \nis crippled in Columbia, Springfield and Joplin, and to some extent in Kansas City, by \nreason  of  the  statutory  and  regulatory  hospital  affiliation  requirement  for  doctors.  \nEspecially in Springfield and Joplin, but to a lesser extent in Columbia and Kansas City, \nthe ASC (surgery center) requirement imposes burdens that have closed or prevented \ndevelopment  of  clinics.    Prompt  relief  from  the  requirements  that  Hellerstedt  ruled \ninvalid  would  not  harm  defendants.  While  the  State  Defendants  assert  harmful \nderegulation going beyond what is required, I am seeking the assistance of counsel in \nshaping an order which minimizes collateral damage.  The Supreme Court’s directive \nthat  the  ASC  requirement  be  invalidated  as  a  package,  rather  than  engaging  in \nseverance,  may  necessarily  result  in  some  temporary  elimination  of  useful \nrequirements, harmless to plaintiffs.   Without considering the judgment proposal, it \nwould seem that the pre-2007 regulation of offices of doctors and dentists, not included \nas surgery centers, should suffice.    \nThe failure to act promptly in this case would seriously frustrate the opportunity to \nopen clinics in Springfield and Joplin and the restoration of clinical service in Columbia \nand Kansas City. The abortion rights of Missouri women, guaranteed by constitutional \nrulings, are being denied on a daily basis, in irreparable fashion.  The public interest \nclearly favors prompt relief.      \nI am aware that caution is to be exercised in altering the status quo during litigation \nand that mandatory preliminary injunctions are not favored. A mandatory injunction is \nnot needed.  I would suppose the status quo in this case was changed by the Supreme \n[13] \n \n\nCourt in Hellerstedt, and the danger to the status quo is being posed by defendants, \ninsofar  as  they  would  try  to  enforce  statutory  and  regulatory  provisions  that  are \ninconsistent  with  the  Texas  ruling.  Preliminary  injunctions  against  the  operation  of \ninvalid State laws are often appropriate. Fish v. Kobach, 840 F.3d 710 (10th Cir. 2016); \nJane Doe v. Mundy, 514 F.2d 1179 (7th Cir. 1975) (an early abortion case). A recent \nlocal case denying relief notes that a preliminary injunction that is both mandatory and \ndisruptive of the status quo can properly be granted when the factors considered weigh \nheavily and compellingly in favor of the movant.  Real Time Pharmacy Services, Inc. v. \nExpress Scripts, Inc., 2017 WL 1196485 (E.D. Mo.) (citing Kikumura v. Hurley, 242 F.3d \n950, 955 (10th Cir. 2001)). If that heavy burden were applicable, plaintiffs have met it.  \nFurther delay would be unacceptable.   \n \nB.  Collateral Harm \n  At oral argument the State Solicitor gave first priority to the possible collateral \ndamage of a ruling against the State Defendants. I have invited counsel to suggest a \nproposed  order  minimizing  that  problem.  By  reason  of  Hellerstedt,  however,  which \nwarns against district judges getting unnecessarily involved in regulatory detail, there \nare limits to how narrowly I can confine my order, but I await a proposal or proposals \nwithin ten days.  \n \nC. One plaintiff’s Settlement Agreement  \n      The Kansas City organization, but not the St. Louis organization or the plaintiff \nphysician, sought to litigate various aspects of the 2007 statute which imposed surgical \n[14] \n \n\ncenter  standards  on  abortion  clinics  having  material  activity.  Without  benefit  of \nHellerstedt or more recent experience with targeted regulation of abortion clinics, Judge \nSmith filed a mixed ruling on application for a preliminary injunction and urged the \nplaintiffs and Department of Health and Senior Services to work together to develop \nfeasible plans for the physical requirements and operation of clinics in Kansas City and \nColumbia.  Planned Parenthood of Kansas and Mid-Missouri, Inc. v. Drummond, 2007 \nWL 2811407 (W.D. Mo).9  Negotiations finally produced a Settlement Agreement in \n2010. (Doc. 27-1).  The State Defendants contend that this agreement is a bar to relief, \nat least in favor of the Kansas City plaintiff.  \n  Briefing on this issue has been fitful, given the limited effect of a ruling on this \npoint in favor of the State Defendants. It is obviously not a bar to relief that would \nadvance the prospect of abortion clinics in Springfield and/or Joplin, sponsored by the \nSt. Louis plaintiff. Those prospective clinics have the greatest needs for eliminating the \nsurgery center requirement.   The Columbia and Kansas City clinics seem in most need \nof physicians who are not crippled by the hospital affiliation requirement, and thus the \n                                                      \n9  The Drummond ruling expresses some skepticism concerning plaintiffs’ then-novel \nreference to an equal protection issue.  After anti-abortion regulation became more \nubiquitous, however, Judge Posner observed that an “issue of equal protection of the \nlaws is lurking in this case.  For the state seems indifferent to complications from non-\nhospital procedures other than surgical abortion . . . even when they are more likely to \nproduce complications.” Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin, Inc. v. Van Hollen, 738 F.3d \n786,  789  (7th  Cir.  2013).  The  Hellerstedt  majority  opinion  emphasizes  disparate \ntreatment, a subject dealt with in many of the filings here.  The Court majority is now   \nscrutinizing  closely  how  protected  but  often  unpopular  abortion  activity  is  being \n“targeted” by legislatures in many States. The Thomas dissent in Hellerstedt complains \nof  this  heightened  scrutiny.  136  S.Ct.  at  2329.  It  seems  likely,  however,  that  this \napproach was a major factor in moving Justice Kennedy toward a protective ruling, \ngiven his record of special sensitivity to discrimination against unpopular groups and \nprotected activities.  See, e.g., Romer v. Evans, 517 U.S. 620 (1996). This aspect of \nHellerstedt  may  have  produced  the  strongest  ruling  protecting  abortion  rights  in \ndecades, as  Justice Thomas has characterized it. Id. at 2326.  \n[15] \n \n\nplaintiff physician has the primary need for injunctive relief from that requirement.  I am \nthus not compelled to make a definitive evaluation of the Settlement Agreement in \nadvance of granting a preliminary injunction.10  \n \nD. Prosecuting Attorneys \nThe defendant prosecuting attorneys appearing at argument declined an opportunity \nto participate. Enjoining the prosecutors, as was done in Jegley, is unusual when the \nlikelihood of prosecution is remote. Judicial notice, however, is taken that abortion clinic \nactivity is controversial and that opponents of abortion may well urge prosecutors to \nenforce  the  law,  as  it  appears  in  the  statute  books.    A  precautionary  injunction  is \ntherefore useful here. The preliminary injunction, when issued, will be applicable to all \ndefendants except the Attorney General, who should not be enjoined, according to \nReproductive Health Services of Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region Inc. v. \nNixon, 428 F.3d 1139 (8th Cir. 2005). \n \nE.  Security  \nAs is customary in cases of this nature, where plaintiffs are serving a public interest, \nthe Planned Parenthood entities are not-for-profit organizations, and the governmental \n                                                      \n10 It may be worth noting that the 2010 agreement on its face was primarily intended to \nresolve physical requirements for existing clinics and questions about the amount of \nattorney’s fees of plaintiffs for which the defendants became responsible.  There was an \nincidental release of defendants and “any current or former employee” from liabilities \nwhich the Kansas City organization has or “which may hereafter accrue” regarding \n“licensure of the Columbia and (Kansas City) centers.” Whether future officials would be \nprotected and how long the protection might last seem questionable. Superior Concrete \nAccessories Inc. v. Kemper, 284 S.W.2d 482 (Mo. 1955).  The 2010 agreement seems \nnot to have been raised as a defense in litigation before Judge Laughrey regarding \nphysician  availability  and  licensing  of  the  Columbia  clinic.    Planned  Parenthood  of \nKansas and Mid-Missouri v. Lyskowski, 2015 WL 9463198 (W.D. Mo.)   \n[16] \n \n\nentities will not be harmed by the order entered, security for costs and damages in the \nevent the defendants are wrongfully enjoined will not be required.  \nIn accordance with previous notice to counsel, it is therefore ORDERED that the \nmotion  for  preliminary  injunction  (Doc.  14)  is  hereby  GRANTED,  and  that  counsel \nsupply to the court, within ten days of this date, a proposed preliminary injunction order \n(or orders) effectuating the foregoing ruling, without prejudice to appellate rights the \nparties may wish to pursue. As previously noted, the principal objective of requesting \ndrafts  is  to  avoid  unintended  collateral  harm  from  enjoining  the  surgery  center \nrequirement.   \n \n \n                                /s/  Howard F.

The Court, being duly advised of the premises, denies said \nmotion without prejudice.  \nBACKGROUND \n  On November 30, 2016, Plaintiffs Comprehensive Health of Planned Parenthood Great \nPlains, Reproductive Health Services of Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region, and Ronald \nN. Yeomans, M.D. (“Plaintiffs”) filed claims against Josh Hawley in his official capacity as \nMissouri Attorney General and Dr. Randall Williams in his official capacity as Director of the \nMissouri Department of Health and Senior Services, among others (“Defendants”). Plaintiffs’ \ncomplaint includes claims for violation of substantive due process and equal protection relating to \nthe Ambulatory Surgical Center (“ASC”) restriction and the Hospital Relationship Requirement.1  \n                                                            \n1 In their first motion for preliminary injunction (Doc. #1), that was granted by this district court (Doc. #93) and later \nvacated by the Eighth Circuit (Doc. #131-1), Plaintiffs also sought to enjoin the Missouri restriction requiring facilities \nwhich provide abortion services to be licensed as ambulatory surgical centers (“ASCs”) -- Mo. Rev. Stat. §197.200 \n(“ASC Requirement”). The ASC requirement is not at issue for purposes of the instant motion. Further, to the extent \nPlaintiffs’ first motion for preliminary injunction also sought to enjoin the requirement of a relationship with a local \nhospital (“Hospital Relationship Requirement”) – Mo. Rev. Stat. §197.215, only the admitting privileges restriction \n1 \n \n\n  On Plaintiffs’ motion, the district court preliminarily enjoined enforcement of both the \nASC restriction and the Hospital Relationship Requirement. On September 10, 2018, the Court of \nAppeals for the Eighth Circuit vacated the preliminary injunction in its entirety, and remanded the \nmatter back to the district court for proceedings consistent with its opinion. The Eighth Circuit \nissued its mandate on October 1, 2018.  \n  Plaintiffs filed the instant motion on September 19, 2018 seeking a limited temporary \nrestraining  order  and/or  preliminary  injunction  against  Mo.  Rev.  Stat.  §§  188.080  and \n188.027(1)(1)(e) (together “Privileges Requirement”), which require abortion providers to have \nlocal hospital admitting privileges to avoid criminal charges, and to inform patients of those local \nhospital admitting privileges.  Plaintiffs seek relief with respect Plaintiffs’ health center located in \nColumbia, Missouri, which only provides surgical abortions.2  \n  On October 1, 2018, the Court heard argument on Plaintiffs’ second motion for injunctive \nrelief. The Court, having considered the parties’ briefs, arguments, and the record as a whole, \ndenies Plaintiffs’ request for injunctive relief without prejudice to reassertion.  \nLEGAL STANDARD  \nStanding is a “jurisdictional prerequisite” the Court must consider as a threshold issue. \nBernbeck v. Gale, 829 F.3d 643, 646 (8th Cir. 2016) (citing Curtis Lumber Co. v. La. Pac. Corp., \n618 F.3d 762, 770 & n.2 (8th Cir. 2010)). To satisfy “the irreducible constitutional minimum of \nstanding,” a plaintiff must establish an injury-in-fact, causation, and redressability. Lujan v. Defs. \nof Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 561 (1992) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  \n                                                            \n(“Privileges Requirement”), which is one of the Hospital Relationship Requirement provisions, is relevant for \npurposes of the instant motion. \n \n2 \n \n\nA plaintiff may establish redressability by showing “it is likely, as opposed to merely \nspeculative, that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.” Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. \nLaidlaw Envtl. Servs. (TOC), Inc., 528 U.S. 167, 181 (2000). Redressability cannot be established \nwhen “there exists an unchallenged, independent rule, policy, or decision that would prevent relief \neven if the court were to render a favorable decision.” Doe v. Virginia Dep’t of State Police, 713 \nF.3d 745, 756 (4th Cir. 2013). \nDISCUSSION \nDefendants argue the Court should deny Plaintiffs’ motion for injunctive relief on the basis \nthat  Plaintiffs  lack  standing  at  this  time.  Defendants  argue  Plaintiffs  cannot  establish  the \nredressability requirement to challenge the Privileges Requirement because the Columbia health \ncenter is currently non-compliant with sanitation regulations. \nThe  Missouri  Department  of  Health  and  Senior  Services  (“DHSS”)  issues  Medical \nTreatment Facility Licenses if a facility “meets the requirements established under sections \n197.200 to 197.240, and have provided affirmative evidence” of other enumerated assurances. Mo. \nRev. Stat. § 197.215.1-.4. Further, DHSS is authorized to promulgate reasonable rules and \nregulations “as are necessary to carry out the provisions of sections 197.200 to 197.240 . . . .” Mo. \nRev. Stat. § 197.225. With reference to “Procedures for Licensing Abortion Facilities,” DHSS \nrules state: “[n]o license shall be issued or renewed by the department until the department has \ninspected the facility and determined that it is in compliance with all requirements of applicable \nregulations and statutes.” Mo. Code Regs. Ann. 19 CSR § 30-30.050(2)(I). Additionally, DHSS \nregulations require  abortion  facilities  to  ensure  the  provision  of  “acceptable  care  in  a  safe \nenvironment and in accordance with all legal requirements and standards of care.” Mo. Code Regs. \nAnn. 19 CSR § 30-30.050(2)(I).  \n3 \n \n\nIn this case, the Columbia health center’s license expired on October 2, 2018. Though the \nColumbia health center sought renewal of its license, a DHSS inspection resulted in the conclusion \nthat the Columbia health center could not be licensed until it complied with all relevant sanitation \nrequirements. Defendants cite to instances of moldy and rusty equipment observed by DHSS \nduring a September 26, 2018 inspection of the Columbia health center.  \nPlaintiffs seek injunctive relief against the Privileges Requirement on or before October 3, \n2018, because Plaintiffs have patients scheduled for treatment on that day. However, at this time, \nPlaintiffs’ license expired on October 2, 2018, and there is no indication that Plaintiffs have \ncorrected the sanitation issues identified by DHSS during its recent inspection in a manner that the \nonly barrier to licensure of the Columbia health center is the Privileges Requirement. \nPlaintiffs concede that even if they are entitled to injunctive relief, they cannot operate \nand/or see patients at the Columbia health center until the DHSS issues a license for operation. \nPlaintiffs also concede the state will not issue a license until the Columbia health center complies \nwith sanitation regulations, and DHSS approves them through a subsequent inspection. The Court \nhas received no indication that Plaintiffs have corrected the issues identified by DHSS as of the \ndate of this order.  \n  Based  on  the  current record,  even  if  the  Court  entered  injunctive  relief  against  the \nPrivileges Requirement as of today’s date, the Columbia health center may not provide treatment \nbecause DHSS has not yet approved the Columbia health center as compliant with all aspects of \nstate  sanitation  regulations.  At  this  point  in  this  litigation,  “there  exists  an  unchallenged, \nindependent rule, policy, or decision that would prevent relief even if the court were to render a \nfavorable decision.” Va. Dep’t of State Police, 713 F.3d at 746. Therefore, the Court cannot \nconclude Plaintiffs’ claims are justiciable at this time.  Accordingly, it is hereby \n4 \n \n\n  ORDERED  Plaintiffs’  Second  Motion  for  Temporary  Restraining  Order  and/or \nPreliminary Injunction (Doc. #132) is DENIED WITHOUT PREJUDICE. Plaintiffs are granted \nleave to reassert the motion at such time as DHSS determines the Columbia health center is \ncompliant  with  all  other  requirements  for  licensure,  with  the  exclusion  of  the  Privileges \nRequirement. \n  IT IS SO ORDERED.  \n \n \n \nDATE: October 3, 2018    /s/ Brian C.

The \nCourt, being duly advised of the premises, denies said motion.  \nBACKGROUND \n  Comprehensive Health of Planned Parenthood Great Plains (“Comprehensive Health”), \nReproductive Health Services of Planned Parenthood of St. Louis Region (“RHS”), and Dr. Ronald \nYeomans (collectively “Plaintiffs”) provide or seek to provide abortion services in Missouri. \nComprehensive Health operates facilities in Kansas City and Columbia, and RHS operates a \nfacility in St. Louis. On November 30, 2016, Plaintiffs filed claims against Defendants Joshua \nHawley, in his official capacity as the Missouri Attorney General,1 and Dr. Randall Williams, in \nhis official capacity as Director of the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services \n(“DHSS”), and others (collectively “Defendants”), alleging certain Missouri statutes violate the \nsubstantive due process and equal protection clauses of the United States Constitution.  \n                                                            \n1 Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 25(d), Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt is substituted for Joshua Hawley.  \n1 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-04313-BCW   Document 186   Filed 02/22/19   Page 1 of 12\n\nMo.  Rev.  Stat.  §197.215(2),  hereinafter  referred  to  as  the  “Hospital  Relationship \nRequirement” states as follows: \n197.215.1. Upon receipt of an application for a license, the department of health \nand senior services shall issue a license if the applicant and ambulatory surgical \ncenter facilities meet the requirements established under sections 197.200 to \n197.240,2 and have provided affirmative evidence that: \n[. . . .] \n(2) Surgical procedures shall be performed only by physicians, dentists or \npodiatrists, who at the time are privileged to perform surgical procedures \nin at least one licensed hospital in the community in which the ambulatory \nsurgical center is located, thus providing assurance to the public that \npatients treated in the center shall receive continuity of care should the \nservices of a hospital be required; alternatively, applicant shall submit a \ncopy of a current working agreement with at least one licensed hospital in \nthe  community  in  which  the  ambulatory  surgical  center  is  located, \nguaranteeing  the  transfer  and  admittance  of  patients  for  emergency \ntreatment whenever necessary  \n[. . . .] \n \nMo. Rev. Stat. § 197.215(2). The implementing regulations for this statute reflect that “in the \ncommunity”  means  no  more  than  15  minutes  away.  Mo.  Code  Regs.  Ann.  tit.  19,  §  30-\n30.060(1)(C)(4).  \nThe other statutes otherwise applicable to facilities providing abortion services in Missouri \nare set forth in Mo. Rev. Stat. §§ 188.027 and 188.080, hereinafter referred to together as the \n“Privileges Requirement.” The Privileges Requirement states as follows: \n188.027.1 Except in the case of medical emergency, no abortion shall be performed \nor induced on a woman without her voluntary and informed consent, given freely \nand without coercion. Consent to an abortion is voluntary and informed and given \nfreely and without coercion, if and only if, at least twenty-four hours prior to the \nabortion: \n  (1) The physician who is to perform or induce the abortion or a qualified \nprofessional has informed the woman, orally, reduced to writing, and in person, of \nthe following:  \n    [ . . . . ]  \n    (e)  The  location  of  the  hospital  that  offers  obstetrical  or \ngynecological care located within thirty miles of the location where the abortion is \n                                                            \n2 Mo. Rev. Stat. §§ 197.200 to 197.240 generally set forth state licensing requirements for ambulatory surgical centers \nand abortion facilities.  \n2 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-04313-BCW   Document 186   Filed 02/22/19   Page 2 of 12\n\nperformed or induced and at which the physician performing or inducing the \nabortion has clinical privileges and where the woman may receive follow-up care \nby the physician if complications arise . . . . \n \n188.080 Any person who is not a physician who performs or induces or attempts to \nperform or induce an abortion on another is guilty of a class B felony, and upon \nconviction, shall be punished as provided by law. Any physician performing or \ninducing an abortion who does not have clinical privileges at a hospital which offers \nobstetrical or gynecological care located within thirty miles of the location at which \nthe abortion is performed or induced shall be guilty of a class A misdemeanor, and \nupon conviction shall be punished as provided by law. \n \n  Mo. Rev. Stat. §§ 188.027, 188.080.  \n \nIn sum, the Hospital Relationship Requirement requires a physician performing a surgical \nprocedure in an ambulatory surgical center to maintain privileges with a hospital that allows the \nphysician to conduct surgical procedures at that hospital. The hospital at which privileges are held \nmay be no more than fifteen minutes away from where the surgical procedure would be performed. \nThe Privileges Requirement requires a physician performing or attempting to perform an abortion \nat a facility to maintain clinical privileges with a hospital that offers obstetrical or gynecological \nservices within thirty miles of the facility offering abortion services, or face criminal liability.   \nIn the instant motion for preliminary injunction, Plaintiffs seek to enjoin enforcement of \nthe Privileges Requirement relative to its facility in Columbia, Missouri, which only provides \nsurgical abortions3 (“Columbia Facility”), on the basis that it violates substantive due process. \nPROCEDURAL HISTORY \nThe instant motion for preliminary injunction is Plaintiffs’ third. Plaintiffs’ first motion for \npreliminary injunction sought to enjoin enforcement of the ambulatory surgical center requirement \n                                                            \n3 “The term ‘surgical abortion’ is a slight misnomer in that the procedure is performed via vacuum aspiration and does \nnot involve general anesthesia or require making an incision.” Comprehensive Health of Planned Parenthood Great \nPlains v. Williams, 322 F. Supp. 3d 921, 924 (W.D. Mo. June 11, 2018).  \n3 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-04313-BCW   Document 186   Filed 02/22/19   Page 3 of 12\n\n(not at issue here), and the Hospital Relationship Requirement. The district court granted Plaintiffs’ \nmotion for preliminary injunction.  \nOn  September  10,  2018,  the  Court  of  Appeals  for  the  Eighth  Circuit  vacated  the \npreliminary injunction in its entirety and remanded the matter to the district court. Comprehensive \nHealth of Planned Parenthood Great Plains v. Hawley, 903 F.3d 750, 759 (8th Cir. 2018). The \nEighth Circuit stated that the “undue burden” standard as set forth in Planned Parenthood of \nSoutheastern Pennsylvania v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833, 877 (1992) and reiterated in Whole Woman’s \nHealth v. Hellerstedt, 136 S. Ct. 2292, 2310 (2016), “requires that courts consider the burdens a \nlaw imposes on abortion access together with the benefits those laws confer.” Hawley, 903 F.3d \nat 755 (citing Hellerstedt, 136 S. Ct. at 2310). The Eighth Circuit found that, in light of Hellerstedt, \nthe district court erred in explicitly refusing the weigh the asserted benefits of the challenged laws \nbecause, as compared to the facts underlying Hellerstedt, “[p]erhaps there was a unique problem \nMissouri was responding to under its inherent police power . . . and the Hospital Relationship \nRequirement may be appropriate given Missouri’s legitimate interest in seeing to it that abortion, \nlike any other medical procedure, is performed under circumstances that insure maximum safety \nfor the patient. Id. at 758. \nThe Eighth Circuit noted “an independent constitutional duty [on the courts] to review \nfactual findings where constitutional rights are at stake,” and directed the district court to, on \nremand, “do that which Hellerstedt instructed: ‘consider[] the evidence in the record – including \nexpert evidence, presented in stipulations, depositions, and testimony and then weigh[] the asserted \nbenefits against the burdens.” Hawley, 903 F.3d at 758.  \nThe Eighth Circuit issued its mandate on October 1, 2018, and the Court heard oral \nargument on Plaintiffs’ second motion for preliminary injunction on the same day. On October 3, \n4 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-04313-BCW   Document 186   Filed 02/22/19   Page 4 of 12\n\n2018, the district court denied Plaintiffs’ second motion for preliminary injunction for lack of \nstanding on the basis that the Columbia Facility did not, excluding its non-compliance with the \nPrivileges Requirement, meet the requirements for state licensure renewal.  \nOn December 14, 2018, DHSS certified the Columbia Facility’s compliance with all \napplicable regulations for state licensure, except the Privileges Requirement, thus conferring \nstanding on Plaintiffs to challenge the Privileges Requirement relative to the Columbia Facility. \nPlaintiffs filed the instant motion for preliminary injunction on December 22, 2018.   \nLEGAL STANDARD \nTo avoid an abuse of discretion in considering whether to issue a preliminary injunction, \nthe district court should avoid the following: (a) “fail[ing] to consider a relevant factor that should \nhave been given significant weight;” (b) considering and giving “significant weight to an irrelevant \nor improper factor”; and (c) “consider[ing] only proper factors – and no improper ones – but in \nweighing those factors, commit[ing] a clear error or judgment.” Planned Parenthood of Ark. & E. \nOkla. v. Jegley, 864 F.3d 953, 957 (8th Cir. 2017) (citing Novus Franchising, Inc. v. Dawson, 725 \nF.3d 885, 893 (8th Cir. 2013)).   \nThe following factors are proper to consider in the context of a motion preliminary \ninjunctive relief: “(1) the threat of irreparable harm to the moving party, (2) the balance between \nthis harm and the injury that granting the injunction will inflict on the non-moving party, (3) the \nprobability that the moving party will succeed on the merits, and (4) the public interest.” Jegley, \n864 F.3d at 957 (citing Dataphase Sys., Inc. v. C L Sys., Inc., 640 F.2d 109, 114 (8th Cir. 1981)). \n“While no single factor is determinative . . . the Eighth Circuit has consistently held that likelihood \nof  success  on  the  merits  is  the  most  important  factor.”  Comprehensive  Health  of  Planned \nParenthood Great Plains v. Williams, 322 F. Supp. 3d 921, 928 (W.D. Mo. June 11, 2018) (citing \n5 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-04313-BCW   Document 186   Filed 02/22/19   Page 5 of 12\n\nBarrett v. Claycomb, 705 F.3d 315, 320 (8th Cir. 2013); S.J.W. ex rel. Wilson v. Lee’s Summit R-\n7 Sch. Dist., 696 F.3d 771, 776 (8th Cir. 2012)).  \nFurther, “[w]here a preliminary injunction is sought to enjoin the implementation of a duly \nenacted state statute . . .  the moving party must make a more rigorous showing that it is likely to \nprevail on the merits.” Jegley, 864 F.3d at 957-58 (citing Planned Parenthood Minn., N.D., S.D. \nv. Rounds, 530 F.3d 724, 733 (8th Cir. 2008)).  \nDISCUSSION \nAs a threshold matter, the parties dispute the scope of the preliminary injunction sought by \nPlaintiffs. The Court must determine whether Plaintiffs may seek injunctive relief through an as-\napplied challenge, though the complaint frames Plaintiffs substantive due process claim as a facial \nchallenge.  \nA. THE LARGE FRACTION TEST APPLIES. \n \nPlaintiffs allege that the Privileges Requirement violates substantive due process under the \nFourteenth Amendment because it is “an unnecessary health regulation that imposes an undue \nburden on women’s right to choose abortion.” (Doc. #1 at 17). Plaintiffs urge the Court to construe \nthis claim as an as-applied challenge relating to the Columbia Facility. In support of this position, \nPlaintiffs assert that although the claim is framed as facial challenge in the complaint, they also \nseek relief as deemed just and proper, such that the Court may properly construe, for purposes of \nPlaintiffs’ preliminary injunction, Plaintiffs’ substantive due process challenge as-applied to the \nColumbia Facility. Defendants counter that the Court is bound to construe Plaintiffs’ claim as a \nfacial challenge to the Privileges Requirement based on the claim as pleaded. Defendants further \nassert as applied challenges are reserved only for challenges to abortion regulations brought by \nindividual women.  \n6 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-04313-BCW   Document 186   Filed 02/22/19   Page 6 of 12\n\nAt the outset, the Court notes that the Eighth Circuit categorized, in the context of \nPlaintiffs’ first motion for preliminary injunction, the substantive due process claim as a facial \nchallenge.  Hawley,  903  F.3d  at  755.  Since  that  categorization,  however,  though  the  same \nallegations are controlling, Plaintiffs have since limited the injunctive relief they are seeking to the \napplication of the Privileges Requirement at the Columbia Facility. The Court is thus inclined to \nfind, for purposes of Plaintiffs’ third motion for preliminary injunction, that Plaintiffs’ substantive \ndue process claim challenging the Privileges Requirement may be properly construed as an as-\napplied challenge at this stage. This conclusion is based on the general premises that “facial \nchallenges are generally disfavored,” and that the Court has authority to craft injunctive relief. \nJegley, 864 F.3d at 958; Gonzales v. Carhart, 550 U.S. 124, 168 (2007). Additionally, persuasive \nauthority suggests a facial challenge may be properly converted into an as applied challenge. W. \nAla. Women’s Ctr. v. Williamson, 900 F.3d 1310, 1325 (11th Cir. 2018) (holding the district court \ndid not err in converting a facial challenge into an as applied challenge). Finally, this conclusion \nmakes logical sense because it would seem that the facts underlying an as-applied challenge are \nanticipated by and included within a facial challenge directed toward the same statute.  \nNotwithstanding this conclusion, however, it is the Court’s view that the parties’ dispute \nabout the type of challenge to the Privileges Requirement is driven mainly by the parties’ \ndisagreement relating to the application of the “large fraction test.” The “large fraction test,” is a \n“different standard” specifically used in “challenges to abortion regulations . . . .” Jegley, 864 F.3d \nat 958. Under the large fraction test, a “plaintiff can prevail by demonstrating that ‘in a large \nfraction of the cases in which the law is relevant, it will operate as a substantial obstacle to a \nwoman’s choice to undergo an abortion.” Id. (citing Casey, 505 U.S. at 895). The parties do not \ndispute the application of the large fraction test in the context of a facial challenge, which explains \n7 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-04313-BCW   Document 186   Filed 02/22/19   Page 7 of 12\n\nDefendants’ position discussed above regarding the proper construction of Plaintiffs’ substantive \ndue process claim challenging the Privileges Requirement. Regardless, though the Court finds \nPlaintiffs’ claim properly construed as an as-applied challenge for purposes of the third motion for \npreliminary injunction, the Court concludes the large fraction test governs analysis for whether \nPlaintiffs have demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits of their claim that the Privileges \nRequirement  violates  substantive  due  process  as  applied  to  the  Columbia  Facility.  See \nComprehensive Health of Planned Parenthood Great Plains v. Williams, 322 F. Supp. 3d 921, 928 \n(W.D. Mo. June 11, 2018). \nB. PLAINTIFF’S THIRD MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION IS DENIED.  \nTo show a likelihood of success on the merits of their substantive due process claim, \nPlaintiffs must demonstrate that the Privileges Requirement imposes an “undue burden on abortion \naccess.” Hellerstedt, 136 S. Ct. at 2300. “A finding of an undue burden is a shorthand for the \nconclusion that a state regulation has the purpose or effect of placing a substantial obstacle in the \npath of a woman seeking an abortion of a nonviable fetus.” Casey, 505 U.S. at 877. In assessing \nwhether such circumstances are present with respect to the challenged law, courts are required to \n“consider the burdens a law imposes on abortion access together with the benefits those laws \nconfer.” Hellerstedt, 136 S. Ct. at 2309. \nAn abortion regulation is considered to be a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman \nseeking an abortion (and thus an undue burden) only if the law being challenged can be said to \n“operate as a substantial obstacle to a woman’s choice to undergo an abortion” “in a large fraction \nof the cases in which the regulation is relevant . . . .” Casey, 505 U.S. at 895; Jegley, 864 F.3d at \n958; Williams, 322 F. Supp. 3d 928. \n8 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-04313-BCW   Document 186   Filed 02/22/19   Page 8 of 12\n\n Thus, Plaintiffs can demonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits by demonstrating \nthat in a large fraction of the cases in which it is relevant, the Privileges Requirement “will operate \nas a substantial obstacle to a woman’s choice to undergo an abortion.” Jegley, 864 F.3d at 958 \n(citing Casey, 505 U.S. at 895).  \nThe dispositive issue, then, is the number of cases in which the Privileges Requirement is \nrelevant. The regulation is relevant to a narrower category than “all women, pregnant women,” or \neven all women seeking abortion within a state. Hellerstedt, 136 S. Ct. at 2320 (citing Casey, 505 \nU.S. at 894-95). Further, where, as in this case, only a certain type of abortion is at issue, the \nrelevant number is further narrowed to include only to those cases where the same certain type of \nabortion is sought. Jegley, 864 F.3d at 958 (“Thus, because the contract-physician requirement \nonly applies to medication-abortion providers, the relevant denominator here is women seeking \nmedication abortions in Arkansas”).  \nPlaintiffs argue the applicable denominator, representing the number of women to whom \nthe  Privileges  Requirement  is  relevant, is  women  seeking  surgical  abortions  for  whom  the \nColumbia Facility is the most geographically convenient. To the contrary, Defendants argue the \napplicable denominator, representing the number of women to whom the Privileges Requirement \nis relevant, is all women seeking surgical abortion in the state of Missouri.  \nOn the current record, the Court need not resolve the geographical limits of the cases to \nwhom the Privileges Requirement is relevant because Plaintiffs have not established a likelihood \nof success on the merits, even if the Court considers the large fraction test pursuant to the \ndenominator  Plaintiffs  suggest.  Stated  differently,  Plaintiffs  have  not  met  their  burden  to \ndemonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits even if the relevant large fraction is as large as \nPlaintiffs would argue. This conclusion results even as the Court considers the large fraction test \n9 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-04313-BCW   Document 186   Filed 02/22/19   Page 9 of 12\n\nmore conceptually than mathematically. Jegley, 864 F.3d at 960 (citing Cincinnati Women’s \nServs., Inc. v. Taft, 468 F.3d 361, 374 (6th Cir. 2006)).  \nIn the context of undue burden analysis, the court is required to “consider the burdens a \nlaw imposes on abortion access together with the benefits those laws confer.” Hellerstedt, 136 S. \nCt. at 2309. In striking down a Texas law similar to the Privileges Requirement here, the Supreme \nCourt found in Hellerstedt that the following burdens are proper considerations in analyzing \nwhether a statute imposes an undue burden: (1) whether the abortion provider has attempted to or \nhas identified local physicians with hospital privileges willing to provide abortions in the particular \ncommunity; (2) whether a significant number of clinics face closure, leading to fewer doctors, \nlonger wait times, and increased crowding; and (3) whether a significant number of women faced \nincreased travel distances. 136 S. Ct. at 2313.  \nWith respect to the first burden identified, whether there are other physicians available with \nhospital privileges willing to provide abortion services in the community is the first “domino,” in \nconsidering the cumulative effect of burdens imposed. June Med. Servs. L.L.C. v. Gee, 905 F.3d \n787, 807 (5th Cir. 2018). With respect to the second burden identified, increased wait times refers \nto both wait time in securing an appointment and wait time in a facility waiting room. Hellerstedt, \n136 S. Ct. at 2318. With respect to this third burden identified, “increased driving distances do not \nalways constitute an undue burden,” but increased driving distances are considered “but one \nadditional burden, which, when taken together with others that the closings brought above, and \nwhen viewed in light of the virtual absence of any health benefit,” may contribute to a finding of \nan undue burden. Id. at 2313. \n10 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-04313-BCW   Document 186   Filed 02/22/19   Page 10 of 12\n\nAdditionally, Jegley instructs that in considering the relevant burdens, the district court \nshould make specific findings as to “the number of women [who] would forgo abortions” and “the \nnumber of women who would postpone their abortions.” 864 F.3d at 959. \nIn this case, the current record does not provide a sufficient basis for the Court to conclude \nthat Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on their claim that the burdens associated with the Privileges \nRequirement as applied to the Columbia Facility, outweigh the benefits conferred by the Privileges \nRequirement as applied to the Columbia Facility.  \nOn remand, the Eighth Circuit directed the Court to make Missouri-specific findings about \nthe benefits and burdens associated with the Privileges Requirement. The previously granted \npreliminary injunction was vacated at least on part on the basis that the district court declined to \nmake specific factual findings. Plaintiffs assert a likelihood of success on the merits based \npredominantly on the declarations of their expert Dr. Lindo. The Court is not convinced that Dr. \nLindo’s opinions, which are extrapolated from data in Texas counties relevant in the Hellerstedt \ncase, provide a basis for the Missouri-specific fact-finding directed by the Eighth Circuit.  \nEven if the Court relies on Dr. Lindo’s opinions to conclude the Privileges Requirement \nresults in increased driving distances for 30 women or 22% of women who would otherwise seek \nabortion services at the Columbia Facility, increased driving distances are “but one” consideration \nin the undue burden analysis. This conclusion results even considering burdens incidental to \nincreased driving distance, such as increased costs, and employment impacts, such as the potential \nerosion of medical confidentiality.  \nThe record does not include evidence of the other relevant burdens associated with the \nPrivileges Requirement. In particular, Plaintiffs do not present evidence of attempts to find \nphysicians with hospital privileges willing to provide abortion services at the Columbia Facility, \n11 \n \nCase 2:16-cv-04313-BCW   Document 186   Filed 02/22/19   Page 11 of 12\n\nor evidence of fewer doctors, longer wait times, and increased crowding at RHS in St. Louis. \nFinally, the record does not provide a basis in evidence to approximate the number of women who \nwill forego or postpone surgical abortion incidental to the inoperability of the Columbia Facility.  \nIn sum, evidence of increased driving distance relative to the Privileges Requirement \nstanding alone, for purposes of the motion for preliminary injunction, is not sufficient, even when \nweighed against the assertions of benefits conferred by the Privileges Requirement, to demonstrate \na likelihood of success on the merits. In the Court’s view, the law directs this conclusion even \nconsidering  the  Defendants’  dubious  assertions  of  benefits  conferred  by  the  Privileges \nRequirement. \nFor all of these reasons, the Court concludes Plaintiffs have not demonstrated a likelihood \nof success on the merits with respect to their claim that the Privileges Requirement violates \nsubstantive due process as applied to the Columbia Facility. \nThe remaining Dataphase factors do not, based on the current record, outweigh Plaintiffs’ \ninability to establish a likelihood of success on the merits. Accordingly, it is hereby \nORDERED Plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunction (Doc. #152) is DENIED. It is \nfurther \nORDERED the parties shall meet and confer regarding a proposed litigation schedule to \nbe filed on or before March 8, 2019.  \nIT IS SO ORDERED. \n \n \nDated: February 22, 2019  /s/ Brian C.
