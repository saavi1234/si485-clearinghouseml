    "summary": "<p>This is a case about South Carolina's inclusion of people with pre-Lawrence v. Texas convictions for consensual gay sex on the state's sex offender registry. Lawrence v. Texas is a U.S. Supreme Court case that held most sanctions of criminal punishment for consensual, adult, non-procreative sexual activity are unconstitutional. On December 22, 2021, a man who was convicted of South Carolina&rsquo;s criminal sodomy statute in 2001 and remained on the sex offender registry, filed this lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District Of South Carolina Columbia Division. The plaintiff sued South Carolina and the South Carolina State Law Enforcement Division under 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1983 and the Fourteenth Amendment. Represented by the ACLU and private counsel, the plaintiff sought declaratory relief and attorneys&rsquo; fees. In addition, the plaintiff sought injunctive relief stopping the defendants from enforcing the criminal sodomy statute, removing the plaintiff from the sex offender registry, expunging records indicating the plaintiff was on the registry, and alerting agencies who were provided information about the plaintiff&rsquo;s registration he is no longer on the registry. The plaintiff also sought injunctive relief ordering the defendants to cease placing individuals convicted under the criminal sodomy statute or a similar offense in another jurisdiction on the registry and informing all relevant agencies that such convictions are no longer registrable offenses. The case was assigned to District Judge Mary Geiger Lewis.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiff was indicted for consensual sex with another man in 2001. In 2006 he received a pardon, but is still required to register as a sex offender. Failure to comply can result in fines and imprisonment. Registered individuals must report in person twice a year for life. They must include immense biographical information as well as all employment, education, vehicle information, and online accounts. Any change in residence, real property ownership, employment, or enrollment in an educational facility must be reported to the county sheriff. Schools must provide registry information to parents. Individuals on the registry are more likely to lose a job, housing, and suffer harassment and assault.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The complaint alleged a violation of the plaintiff's Due Process as the statute was unconstitutional after Lawrence v. Texas, and violates the Equal Protection Clause by treating homosexual intimacy as different than heterosexual without promoting a state interest. The statue was also vague as to which acts are prohibited.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On April 12 the parties filed a joint motion for permanent injunction and on August 22, 2022, Judge Lewis granted the parties&rsquo; joint stipulation. The defendants agreed to remove all individuals on the registry merely for breaking the criminal sodomy statute and no individuals who have a similar conviction in a different jurisdiction would be added. The defendants would inform all removed individuals that they no longer need to register and inform the county sheriff&rsquo;s offices that those individuals are no longer subject to the requirements of the registry. The defendants paid $31,592.30 in plaintiff&rsquo;s fees, costs, and expenses.</p>\r\n<p>The case is now closed.</p>",

Case No. 2X1X-cXvX-_ _ 3_:_2_1_-c_v_-_0_4_1_0_8 -MGL\nALAN WILSON, in his official capacity as \nAttorney General of South Carolina; and \nMARK KEEL, in this official capacity as Chief \nof the South Carolina State Law Enforcement \nDivision, \nDefendants. \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief \nNATURE OF THE ACTION \n1. This case is about a man convicted of being gay prior to the Supreme Court’s\ndecision in Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U.S. 558 (2003), and who South Carolina still makes register \nas a sex offender today. It shows how the lingering effects of centuries of homophobic “sodomy” \nprohibitions persist and asks this Court to put an end to South Carolina’s discrimination. \n2. So-called sodomy laws, which prohibit nonprocreative sex acts traditionally\nassociated with homosexuality (i.e., oral and anal sex), were universal among the states and \nterritories from the founding of the Republic through to the 1960s. In the late twentieth century, a \nfew states began repealing their sodomy laws and some state courts began to invalidate them. \nThen, in 2003, the Supreme Court held that laws that criminalize oral or anal sex (with no other \nelements) violate substantive due process and are invalid under the Fourteenth Amendment. See \ngenerally Lawrence, 539 U.S. 558.  \n1 \n\n3:21-cv-04108-MGL     Date Filed 12/22/21    Entry Number 1     Page 2 of 18\n3.  In Lawrence, the Supreme Court explicitly overruled its prior precedent, Bowers \nv. Hardwick, 478 U.S. 186 (1986), that had held that such intimate sexual conduct received no \nconstitutional protection. Lawrence, 539 U.S. at 578. In the words of the Court, Bowers—a facial \nchallenge to Georgia’s sodomy prohibition—“was not correct when it was decided, and it is not \ncorrect today. It ought not to remain binding precedent. Bowers v. Hardwick should be and now \nis overruled.” Id. In so doing, the Supreme Court facially invalidated all statutes that criminalize \noral or anal sex with no other elements, including South Carolina’s. \n4.  Despite this clear proclamation made nearly two decades ago, South Carolina \ncontinues to enforce its criminal sodomy statute, titled Buggery, South Carolina Code section 16-\n15-120. Specifically, South Carolina requires people convicted of Buggery to register as sex \noffenders and suffer myriad, onerous prescriptions on their everyday life under the South \nCarolina Sex Offender Registry Act, commonly known as SORA. S.C. Code Ann. §§ 23-3-400 \net seq. This is so even though South Carolina’s Buggery statute is materially indistinguishable \nfrom the sodomy statutes struck down as facially unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in \nLawrence. \n5.  SORA seriously restricts the public and personal lives of registrants.  \n6.  Plaintiff John Doe was convicted in 2001 for Buggery for having consensual sex \nwith another man. The other man was also convicted of Buggery. Doe received a pardon in 2006. \nStill, he is subject to sex offense registration restrictions pursuant to a facially unconstitutional \nstatute. He suffers severely under the sex offender label, which involves the state in the daily \nmanagement of his life. \n7.  Doe brings this action to prevent the continued application and enforcement of \nSouth Carolina’s Buggery prohibition, South Carolina Code section 16-15-120. Specifically, Doe \n  2 \n\n3:21-cv-04108-MGL     Date Filed 12/22/21    Entry Number 1     Page 3 of 18\nseeks a declaration that 1) South Carolina’s Buggery prohibition, South Carolina Code section \n16-15-120, is facially unconstitutional as to activity between human beings and as applied to \nDoe; and 2) that South Carolina Code section 23-3-430(C)(11), which makes Buggery an offense \nsubject to SORA, is facially unconstitutional as to activity between human beings and as applied \nto Doe; and, in the alternative, 3) requiring sex offender registration for a conviction under a \nstatute whose only element is engaging in oral or anal sex that pre-dates the Supreme Court’s \ndecision in Lawrence is unconstitutional. \n8.  Doe seeks injunctive relief against state officials from continuing to enforce the \nabove-enumerated statutes, compelling Defendants to remove Doe from SORA and expunge all \nrecords signaling his past inclusion on the registry, and enjoining Defendants from administering \nand enforcing the Buggery statute generally and through SORA specifically.  \nPARTIES \nPlaintiff \n9.  Plaintiff Doe is a resident of South Carolina.  \nDefendants \n10.  Alan Wilson is the Attorney General of South Carolina. As Attorney General, \nWilson oversees the enforcement of South Carolina’s criminal statutes. He is sued in his official \ncapacity. He resides in South Carolina. \n11.  The Attorney General’s office is located in Columbia, South Carolina. \n12.  Mark Keel is the Chief of the South Carolina State Law Enforcement Division \n(SLED). The South Carolina sex offender “registry is under the direction of” Defendant Keel. \nS.C. Code Ann. § 23-3-410(A). Defendant Keel is responsible for “develop[ing] and operat[ing] \nthe registry to: collect, analyze, and maintain information; [and] make information available to \n  3 \n\n3:21-cv-04108-MGL     Date Filed 12/22/21    Entry Number 1     Page 4 of 18\nevery enforcement agency in this State and in other states.” Id. He is sued in his official capacity. \nHe resides in South Carolina. \n13.  Defendant Keel conducts his official business from Columbia, South Carolina. \n14.  Each of the Defendants is a person under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and acted and \ncontinues to act under color of state law as to the allegations in this complaint. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n15.  Doe’s claims are brought under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and the Fourteenth Amendment \nto the United States Constitution. \n16.  This Court has jurisdiction to hear Doe’s claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331, \n1343, and the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201, 2202.  \n17.  Venue is proper in the United States Court for the District of South Carolina \nunder 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(2) because a substantial part of the acts that gave rise to this lawsuit \noccurred principally in this judicial district. This District is also an appropriate venue under 28 \nU.S.C. § 1391(b)(1) because Defendants reside and do business in this judicial district. \n18.  Venue is proper in the Columbia division under Local Rule 3.01 because the \ndefendants reside in this division and a substantial portion of the events or omissions giving rise \nto the claims occurred in this division. \nSTATEMENT OF FACTS \nStatutory Overview \n19.  South Carolina’s Buggery statute criminalizes anal and oral sex with no other \nelements. \n20.  South Carolina’s Buggery statute, South Carolina Code section 16-15-120, states, \nin full, “[w]hoever shall commit the abominable crime of buggery, whether with mankind or \n  4 \n\n3:21-cv-04108-MGL     Date Filed 12/22/21    Entry Number 1     Page 5 of 18\nwith beast,1 shall, on conviction, be guilty of [a] felony and shall be imprisoned in the \nPenitentiary for five years or shall pay a fine of not less than five hundred dollars, or both, at the \ndiscretion of the court.” \n21.  South Carolina’s prohibition on oral and anal sex has existed since the Province \nof Carolina was split into North and South Carolina in 1712. The statute originally included a \ncompulsory death sentence. The death penalty was not removed until more than a century and a \nhalf later, in 1869, when it imposed a five-year mandatory sentence.  \n22.  It wasn’t until 1993 that the State removed the mandatory five-year penalty for \nBuggery and instead imposed a maximum five-year sentence.  \n23.  Essentially unchanged for two centuries, the plain text of section 16-15-120 \ncontinues to prohibit the sex acts traditionally associated with homosexuality—oral and anal sex. \n24.  South Carolina’s Buggery statute is indistinguishable in all material respects from \nthe Texas and Georgia statutes declared unconstitutional in Lawrence. The Texas statute at issue \nin Lawrence prohibited “engag[ing] in deviate sexual intercourse with another individual of the \nsame sex,” Tex. Penal Code Ann. § 21.06(a) (2003), and defined “[d]eviate sexual intercourse” \nas “(A) any contact between any part of the genitals of one person and the mouth or anus of \nanother person; or (B) the penetration of the genitals or the anus of another person with an \nobject.” Tex. Penal Code Ann. § 21.01(1) (2003). The Georgia statute at issue in Bowers, which \nLawrence declared facially unconstitutional, 539 U.S. at 578, prohibited “sodomy,” and defined \n“sodomy” as “any sexual act involving the sex organs of one person and the mouth or anus of \nanother.” Official Code of Ga. Ann. (O.C.G.A.) § 16-6-2 (1984). \n \n1 Doe confines his challenge to the portion of the Buggery statute barring a “buggery . . . \nwith mankind” and does not address the portion of the statute criminalizing sexual conduct “with \nany animal.” \n  5 \n\n3:21-cv-04108-MGL     Date Filed 12/22/21    Entry Number 1     Page 6 of 18\nSouth Carolina Requires Sex Offender Registration for Buggery Convictions \n25.  Despite the South Carolina Buggery statute being facially unconstitutional and the \nSupreme Court declaring that the sexual activity criminalized by the Buggery statute is protected \nby the Fourteenth Amendment, South Carolina requires people with Buggery convictions to \nregister as sex offenders. S.C. Code Ann. § 23-3-430(C)(11). It also requires people with \nconvictions under other state’s unconstitutional sodomy laws to register in South Carolina if they \nreside in the state. Id. (making Buggery a registrable offense); S.C. Code Ann. § 23-3-430(A) \n(making any out-of-state conviction for any “similar offense” to a registrable South Carolina \noffense itself a registrable offense).  \n26.  On information and belief, in addition to John Doe there are at least eighteen \nother people made to register in South Carolina for Buggery convictions or for out-of-state \nconvictions that South Carolina deems a “similar offense” to Buggery.  \nRegistration Requirements and Burdens \n27.  A person subject to registration under SORA must report, in person, twice a year \nto register. S.C. Code Ann. § 23-3-460(A).  \n28.  The information that offenders are required to report upon registration is \nencyclopedic in scope. A registrant must provide their name; their social security number; their \nage; their race; their sex; their photograph; their date of birth; their addresses of permanent and \ntemporary residence; their place of employment; their date of employment; the name, address, \nand county of any institution of higher learning where the registrant is enrolled, employed, \nvolunteers, interns, or otherwise carries on a vocation; their vehicle’s make, model, color, and \nlicense tag number; their fingerprints; their palm prints; and any and every online account they \nuse. S.C. Code Ann. §§ 23-3-530(2)(a–c); 23-3-555(B).  \n  6 \n\n3:21-cv-04108-MGL     Date Filed 12/22/21    Entry Number 1     Page 7 of 18\n29.  A registrant must notify the county sheriff within three business days of any \nchange in residence, real property ownership, employment, or enrollment in an educational \nfacility. S.C. Code Ann. § 23-3-460(C). \n30.  These registration obligations run to every county where a registrant resides, owns \nreal property, is employed, or goes to school. S.C. Code Ann. § 23-3-450.  \n31.  School districts must provide the “names and addresses of every sex offender who \nresides within one thousand feet of a school bus stop within the school district to the parents or \nguardians of a student who boards or disembarks a school bus at [such] a stop” or provide a link \nto the online registry on the school district’s website for parents to gather this information \nthemselves. S.C. Code Ann. § 23-3-535(F)(1)(a–b).  \n32.  Failure to follow SORA’s strict dictates is, on the first offense, a misdemeanor \nsubject to a $1,000 fine and up to 366 days of imprisonment. S.C. Code Ann. § 23-3-470(B)(1). \nA second offense carries a mandatory 366 days of imprisonment, no part of which may be \nsuspended and for which no probation can be granted. S.C. Code Ann. § 23-3-470(B)(2). A third \noffense carries a mandatory five-year imprisonment, three years of which cannot be suspended or \ngiven probation. S.C. Code Ann. § 23-3-470(B)(3). \n33.  Registration is for life. S.C. Code Ann. § 23-3-460(A).  \n34.  South Carolina maintains people registered under SORA on the South Carolina \nregistry even after they move to another state.  \n35.  Even a pardon doesn’t free a registrant from the burdens of registration. S.C. \nCode Ann. § 23-3-430(F). \n  7 \n\n3:21-cv-04108-MGL     Date Filed 12/22/21    Entry Number 1     Page 8 of 18\n36.  In addition to the direct statutory consequences, registration under SORA also \nimposes collateral consequences. For example, registration under SORA automatically \ndisqualifies Doe from federally assisted housing. 42 U.S.C. § 13663(a) (2012). \n37.  Defendant SLED also publishes Doe’s information and offense history on an \nonline and publicly available database, thereby exposing him to “profound humiliation and \ncommunity-wide ostracism.” Smith v. Doe, 538 U.S. 84, 115 (2003) (Ginsburg, J., dissenting). \n38.  In 2014, the Justice Policy Journal analyzed the collateral consequences of sex \noffender registration. Frenzel, et al., Understanding Collateral Consequences of Registry Laws, \n11 JUSTICE POL. J. 2 (Fall 2014). Of the 443 individuals considered by the study, 49.9% reported \nthat they had lost a job as the result of the sex offender registry, 54.4% reported they lost a place \nto live, 41.8% reported they had been harassed in person, and 13.6% reported they had been \nphysically assaulted/attacked because of their status on the sex offender registry. Id. at 11. \nFacts Specific to John Doe \n39.  John Doe was charged with and indicted for Buggery for having consensual sex \nwith another man in 2001.  \n40.  Both men were adults.  \n41.  Both pleaded guilty.  \n42.  Doe’s Buggery conviction is his only registrable offense. \n43.  In 2006, Doe received a pardon for his Buggery conviction.  \n44.  Despite his pardon, South Carolina still requires Doe to register as a sex offender. \nSee S.C. Code Ann. § 23-3-430(F) (requiring registration despite pardons). \n45.  Doe is subject to all of SORA’s restrictions due to a pre-Lawrence conviction for \nBuggery, South Carolina Code section 16-15-120—a statute that is unconstitutional on its face. \n  8 \n\n3:21-cv-04108-MGL     Date Filed 12/22/21    Entry Number 1     Page 9 of 18\nRegistration burdens virtually every aspect of Doe’s life. See Registration Requirements and \nBurdens, supra. Requiring Doe to register as a sex offender for a Buggery conviction serves no \nlegitimate purpose. The mandate that Doe be subject to the harsh requirements of the sex \noffender registry law is unjustifiable and unconstitutional. \n46.  Doe suffers continuing harm because of the continued application of South \nCarolina’s Buggery statute and the registration requirements imposed by S.C. Code Ann. § 23-3-\n430(C)(11).  \nFederal District Courts Enjoin Similar Requirements in Other States \n47.  Federal district courts have recently enjoined similar constitutional violations in \nother states. \n48.  One plaintiff challenged his registration obligation in Montana for a 1993 \nconviction under Idaho’s sodomy statute. Menges v. Knudsen, No. CV 20-178-M-DLC, --- \nF.Supp.3d ---, 2021 WL 1894154, at *1 (D. Mont. May 11, 2021), appeal docketed No. 21-\n35370 (May 12, 2021). Montana required that he register there because it imposed a reciprocal \nregistration requirement, meaning anyone who had a registrable offense in the state of conviction \nwas required to register in Montana regardless of whether Montana required registration for an \nequivalent offense.2 Id. After the defendants moved to dismiss and the plaintiff moved for a \npreliminary injunction, the district court—recognizing that the case presented a question of law, \nnot fact—advanced the trial on the merits and enjoined the state from requiring the plaintiff to \nregister. Id. at *2. The case lasted six months and two days from filing the complaint to final \njudgment. Id. \n \n2 South Carolina also has such a requirement. S.C. Code Ann. § 23-3-430(A). \n  9 \n\n3:21-cv-04108-MGL     Date Filed 12/22/21    Entry Number 1     Page 10 of 18\n49.  The same plaintiff from the Montana case also filed suit in Idaho, along with \nanother plaintiff proceeding pseudonymously, challenging Idaho’s registration requirement for \npeople with Idaho Crime Against Nature convictions. Doe v. Wasden, No. 1:20-CV-00452-\nBLW, --- F.Supp.3d ---, 2021 WL 4129144, at *1 (D. Idaho Sept. 8, 2021) appeal docketed No. \n21-35826 (Oct. 10, 2021). Assessing a motion to dismiss by the defendants and a motion for a \npreliminary injunction by the plaintiffs, the District of Idaho found the plaintiffs were likely to \nsucceed on their due process (under both substantive and procedural due process theories) and \nequal protection claims and preliminarily enjoined the plaintiffs’ registration obligations. Id. at \n*11–17.  \nCAUSES OF ACTION \nFirst Cause of Action \nFourteenth Amendment: Due Process  \n42 U.S.C. § 1983 \n \n50.  Doe incorporates by reference every allegation in the preceding paragraphs as if \nset forth fully here. \n51.  Doe brings this claim against all Defendants in their official capacities. \n52.  Defendants’ maintenance, administration, and enforcement of South Carolina’s \nBuggery statute, South Carolina Code section 16-15-120, is facially unconstitutional.  \n53.  Defendants’ maintenance, administration, and enforcement of South Carolina’s \nSex Offender Registration Act’s provision that makes Buggery a registerable offense, South \nCarolina Code section 23-3-430(C)(11), is facially unconstitutional.  \n54.  Defendants’ maintenance, administration, and enforcement of both South \nCarolina Code sections 16-15-120 and 23-3-430(C)(11) on their face and with respect to Doe \n  10 \n\n3:21-cv-04108-MGL     Date Filed 12/22/21    Entry Number 1     Page 11 of 18\nviolates Doe’s rights to due process under the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States \nConstitution and flouts the clear mandate of Lawrence v. Texas. \n55.  All Defendants’ actions are under color of law and enabled by their authority as \nstate officers. \n56.  Doe is entitled to declaratory relief in the form of this Court ruling that South \nCarolina Code section 16-15-120 is facially unconstitutional and unenforceable in any situation \ninvolving conduct between human beings. \n57.  Doe is entitled to declaratory relief in the form of this Court ruling that South \nCarolina Code section 23-3-430(C)(11) is facially unconstitutional and unenforceable in any \nsituation involving conduct between human beings. \n58.  Doe is entitled to declaratory relief in the form of this Court ruling that South \nCarolina Code section 23-3-430(C)(11) is unconstitutional as applied to his Buggery conviction.  \n59.

As a result of Defendants’ unlawful conduct, Doe is suffering harm, including \nembarrassment, humiliation, shame, fear, loss of opportunity (including, but not limited to, \ncareer, professional, economic, housing, educational, and social opportunities), and stigma. \nSecond Cause of Action \nFourteenth Amendment: Equal Protection \n43 U.S.C. § 1983 \n \n63.  Doe incorporates by reference every allegation in the preceding paragraphs as if \nset forth fully here. \n64.  Doe brings this claim against all Defendants in their official capacities. \n65.  By treating acts of homosexual sexual intimacy differently from acts of \nheterosexual sexual intimacy, South Carolina Code section 16-15-120 violates the Equal \nProtection Clause because it is not necessary and the least restrictive means of addressing a \ncompelling state interest.   \n66.  By treating acts of homosexual sexual intimacy differently from acts of \nheterosexual sexual intimacy, South Carolina Code section 16-15-120 violates the Equal \nProtection Clause because it is not substantially related to serving an important state interest.  \n67.  By treating acts of homosexual sexual intimacy differently from acts of \nheterosexual sexual intimacy, South Carolina Code section 16-15-120 violates the Equal \nProtection Clause because it has no rational relationship to a legitimate government interest. \n68.  By requiring sex offender registration for acts of homosexual sexual intimacy and \nnot requiring registration for acts of heterosexual sexual intimacy, South Carolina Code section \n23-3-430(C)(11) violates the Equal Protection Clause because it is not necessary and the least \nrestrictive means of addressing a compelling state interest.   \n  12 \n\n3:21-cv-04108-MGL     Date Filed 12/22/21    Entry Number 1     Page 13 of 18\n69.

Doe is entitled to declaratory relief in the form of this Court ruling that South \nCarolina Code section 16-15-120 is facially unconstitutional and unenforceable in any situation \ninvolving conduct between human beings. \n72.  Doe is entitled to declaratory relief in the form of this Court ruling that South \nCarolina Code section 23-3-430(C)(11) is facially unconstitutional and unenforceable in any \nsituation involving conduct between human beings. \n73.  Doe is entitled to declaratory relief in the form of this Court ruling that South \nCarolina Code section 23-3-430(C)(11) is unconstitutional as applied to his Buggery conviction.  \n74.  Doe is entitled to injunctive relief in the form of this Court enjoining the \nDefendants from enforcing South Carolina Code section 16-15-120 in any situation involving \nconduct between human beings. \n75.  Doe is entitled to injunctive relief in the form of this Court enjoining the \nDefendants from enforcing South Carolina Code section 23-3-430(C)(11) in any situation \ninvolving conduct between human beings. \n  13 \n\n3:21-cv-04108-MGL     Date Filed 12/22/21    Entry Number 1     Page 14 of 18\n76.  Doe is entitled to injunctive relief in the form of this Court enjoining the \nDefendants from enforcing South Carolina Code section 23-3-430(C)(11) as applied to him for \nhis Buggery conviction.  \n77.  As a result of Defendants’ unlawful conduct, Doe is suffering harm, including \nembarrassment, humiliation, shame, fear, loss of opportunity (including, but not limited to, \ncareer, professional, economic, housing, educational, and social opportunities), and stigma. \nThird Cause of Action \nFourteenth Amendment: Vagueness \n42 U.S.C. § 1983 \n \n78.  Doe incorporates by reference every allegation in the preceding paragraphs as if \nset forth fully here. \n79.  Doe brings this claim against all Defendants in their official capacities. \n80.  South Carolina’s Buggery statute, South Carolina Code section 16-15-120, does \nnot define what conduct is permitted and what conduct is prohibited in such a way that a person \nof ordinary intelligence can readily determine whether a sex act is allowable or prohibited. \n81.  If the section 16-15-120 prohibits all oral and anal sex, it violates the Supreme \nCourt’s command in Lawrence. If it allows any act of oral or anal sex, it is unconstitutionally \nvague. \n82.  The criteria Defendants use in determining what oral or anal sex is prohibited and \nwhat oral or anal sex is permitted are not clearly defined such that a person of ordinary \nintelligence can readily determine whether a sex act is allowable or prohibited. \n83.  Such vagueness also contributes to unfettered discretion exercised by Defendants. \n84.  Defendant’s enforcement of the Buggery statute violates Doe’s rights under the \nDue Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. \n  14 \n\n3:21-cv-04108-MGL     Date Filed 12/22/21    Entry Number 1     Page 15 of 18\n85.  South Carolina’s SORA states that a conviction under South Carolina’s Buggery \nstatute is a registrable offense. S.C. Code Ann. § 23-3-430(C)(11). If SORA allows some \nindividuals with Buggery convictions, or a conviction in another jurisdiction that is substantially \nequivalent to South Carolina’s Buggery statute, to avoid registration, it is unconstitutionally \nvague. \n86.  The criteria Defendants use to determine what Buggery convictions, or out-of-\nstate convictions are substantial equivalents to the Buggery law, trigger registration (or allow one \nto escape registration) are not clearly defined such that a person of ordinary intelligence can \nreadily determine whether a conviction triggers registration. \n87.  Such vagueness also contributes to unfettered discretion exercised by Defendants. \n88.  Doe is entitled to declaratory relief in the form of this Court ruling that South \nCarolina Code section 16-15-120 is facially unconstitutional and unenforceable in any situation \ninvolving conduct between human beings. \n89.  Doe is entitled to declaratory relief in the form of this Court ruling that South \nCarolina Code section 23-3-430(C)(11) is facially unconstitutional and unenforceable in any \nsituation involving conduct between human beings. \n90.  Doe is entitled to declaratory relief in the form of this Court ruling that South \nCarolina Code section 23-3-430(C)(11) is unconstitutional as applied to his Buggery conviction.  \n91.  Doe is entitled to injunctive relief in the form of this Court enjoining the \nDefendants from enforcing South Carolina Code section 16-15-120 in any situation involving \nconduct between human beings. \n  15 \n\n3:21-cv-04108-MGL     Date Filed 12/22/21    Entry Number 1     Page 16 of 18\n92.  Doe is entitled to injunctive relief in the form of this Court enjoining the \nDefendants from enforcing South Carolina Code section 23-3-430(C)(11) in any situation \ninvolving conduct between human beings. \n93.  Doe is entitled to injunctive relief in the form of this Court enjoining the \nDefendants from enforcing South Carolina Code section 23-3-430(C)(11) as applied to him for \nhis Buggery conviction. \n94.  As a result of Defendants’ unlawful conduct, Doe is suffering harm, including \nembarrassment, humiliation, shame, fear, loss of opportunity (including, but not limited to, \ncareer, professional, economic, housing, educational, and social opportunities), and stigma. \nREQUEST FOR RELIEF \nDoe respectfully requests an order and judgment: \n1.
