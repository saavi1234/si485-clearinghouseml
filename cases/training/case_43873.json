      "Biden Student Loan Forgiveness Plan challenges"
    ],
    "special_case_type": [],
    "state": "Texas",
    "summary": "<p>This case concerns one of many challenges to President Biden's executive action to cancel up to $20,000 of federal student loans per borrower. On October 10, 2022, two private plaintiffs represented by private attorneys filed suit against the U.S. Department of Education (DOE) in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas, challenging President Biden's student loan forgiveness plan. The debtor-plaintiffs alleged that the Department of Education (DoE) violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) by (a) making arbitrary program design decisions and (b) by failing to meet the APA's notice and comment requirements. Those alleged arbitrary design decisions included the bases on which these plaintiffs had been excluded: one plaintiff was ineligible for Biden's debt relief because her loans were commercially held; the other plaintiff was eligible for only $10,000 rather than $20,000 of forgiveness because he hadn't received a Pell Grant. The debtor-plaintiffs requested that the court declare that the program violated the APA, vacate the program, preliminarily and permanently enjoin the DoE from enforcing the program, and award the plaintiffs attorneys' fees and costs.</p>\r\n<p>On October 19, the DoE moved to dismiss the case for lack of jurisdiction. On November 2, Judge Mark Pittman notified the parties of its intent to consolidate the plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction with a full determination on the merits, since Judge Pittman didn't expect further evidence to emerge. The DoE objected to this consolidation, but on November 10, 2022, the Judge overruled the DoE's objection and proceeded to make a final judgment on the full case. The Judge denied the DoE's motion to dismiss, saying the debtor-plaintiffs did have standing. Judge Pittman then granted the debtor-plaintiff's request for an injunction and vacated the debt relief program, holding substantively that the DoE lacked clear congressional authorization for the action. Specifically, he reasoned that the debt program was procedurally acceptable (that the Health and Economic Recovery Omnibus Emergency Solutions (HEROES) Act properly exempted Biden's debt relief plan from procedural notice and comment requirements), but that substantively, the \"major questions doctrine\" applied. The \"major questions doctrine\" applies when an administrative action is of vast \"economic and political significance\"&mdash;which Judge Pittman thought described the debt relief program&mdash;and the doctrine's result is that agency authorization should be reviewed skeptically and struck down unless there is \"clear congressional authorization.\" Under skeptical review, the Judge found that the HEROES act did not authorize the DoE to implement the debt relief plan. 640 F.Supp.3d 644.</p>\r\n<p>The DoE immediately appealed the decision to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals and on November 15, 2022 also requested an emergency motion to stay the injunction. Two weeks later, on November 30, Fifth Circuit Judges Jennifer Elrod, James Graves, and James Ho denied the motion for the stay; and expedited the matter to the next randomly generated oral argument panel.</p>\r\n<p>On December 2, 2022, the Biden Administration submitted an application for a stay to the Supreme Court. Shortly thereafter, on December 12, the Supreme Court decided to hear the case and announced that consideration of the stay would be deferred pending oral argument, scheduled for February 2023. This case was heard alongside <a href=\"../../../../case/43874/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Biden v. Nebraska</a>, another challenge to the loan forgiveness program.</p>\r\n<p>On June 30, 2023, the Supreme Court handed down a unanimous ruling, holding that the plaintiffs in this case did not possess Article III standing, and thus they could not assert a procedural challenge to the loan forgiveness plan. The plaintiffs had argued that they had standing because if the loan forgiveness plan was invalidated, the Biden Administration might use the Higher Education Act of 1965 (HEA) to provide loan forgiveness that included the plaintiffs. However, the Supreme Court found that the plaintiffs' injury was not \"fairly traceable\" to the Administration's loan forgiveness plan, since there was no direct connection between the HEROES Act plan and the plaintiffs' preferred result of a loan forgiveness program under the HEA. Therefore, the Supreme Court vacated the district court's decision enjoining the loan forgiveness plan. 600 U.S. 551.</p>\r\n<p>However, the Supreme Court invalidated President Biden's student loan forgiveness plan in <em>Biden v. Nebraska</em>, holding that the Secretary of Education did not have the authority under the HEA to establish the student loan forgiveness program. 143 S.Ct. 2355.</p>\r\n<p>On August 15, 2023, the district court dismissed this case, and it is now closed.</p>",

On June 30 of the following year, the Supreme Court vacated the district court's decision and dismissed the case because the plaintiffs lacked standing, though it separately invalidated the student loan forgiveness plan in Biden v.

BROWN  \nET  AL. \nCERTIORARI BEFORE JUDGMENT TO THE UNITED STATES \nCOURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT  \nNo. 22–535.  Argued February 28, 2023—Decided June  30, 2023  \nTo alleviate hardship expected to be caused by the impending resump-\ntion of federal student-loan repayments that had been suspended dur-\ning the multi-year coronavirus pandemic, Secretary of Education Mi-\nguel Cardona announced a substantial student-loan debt-forgiveness  \nplan (Plan).  The Plan discharges $10,000 to $20,000 of an eligible bor-\nrower’s debt, depending on criteria such as the borrower’s income and \nthe type of loan held.  The Secretary invoked the Higher Education \nRelief Opportunities for Students  Act of 2003 (HEROES Act), which \nauthorizes the Secretary “to waive or modify any provision” applicable \nto federal “student financial assistance” programs “as may be neces-\nsary to ensure that .  . . recipients of student financial assistance” are \nno worse off “financially in relation to that financial assistance be-\ncause” of a national emergency or disaster.  20 U. S. C. §§1098bb(a)(1),  \n(a)(2)(A), 1098ee(2)(C)–(D).  The  HEROES Act also exempts rules \npromulgated pursuant to it from the otherwise-applicable negotiated-\nrulemaking and notice-and-comment processes. \n     Before the Plan took effect, various plaintiffs—including respond-\nents here—sued to enjoin it.  Respondents Myra Brown and Alexander \nTaylor are two borrowers who do  not qualify for the maximum relief  \navailable under the Plan.  Their one-count complaint alleges that the \nSecretary was required to follow notice-and-comment and negotiated-\nrulemaking procedures in promulgating the Plan, which all agree he \ndid not do.  Brown and Taylor argue that the HEROES Act’s proce-\ndural exemptions apply only when  the rule promulgated is substan-\ntively authorized by the Act, and because the HEROES Act does not \nauthorize the Plan (they argue), the Secretary was required to follow \nnegotiated rulemaking and notice and comment.  The District Court \n\n2  DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION v. BROWN \n   \nSyllabus  \nrejected their argument regarding the scope of the HEROES Act’s pro-\ncedural exemptions, but nevertheless vacated the Plan as substan-\ntively unauthorized.  This Court granted certiorari before judgment to \nconsider this case alongside Biden v.  Nebraska, No. 22–506, which pre-\nsents a similar challenge to the Plan.  \nHeld: Because respondents fail to establish that any injury they suffer \nfrom not having their loans forgiven is fairly traceable to the Plan, they \nlack Article III standing, so the Court has no jurisdiction to address \ntheir procedural claim.  Pp. 6–15. \n   (a) “This case begins and ends with standing.”   Carney v.  Adams, \n592 U. S. ___, ___.  The Court’s authority under the Constitution is  \nlimited to resolving “Cases” or “Controversies.”  Art. III, §2.  The  \nCourt’s jurisprudence has “established that the irreducible constitu-\ntional minimum of standing contains three elements” that a plaintiff \nmust plead and—ultimately—prove.  Lujan v.  Defenders of Wildlife, \n504 U. S. 555, 560.  Those elements are: (1) a “concrete and particular-\nized” injury that is (2) “fairly traceable” to the challenged action of the \ndefendant and (3) “likely” to be “redressed by a favorable decision.”  Id., \nat 560–561 (alterations and internal quotation marks omitted).  But  \nwhere, as here, the plaintiff alleges that she has been deprived of a \nprocedural right to protect her concrete interest, she need not show \nthat observing the contested procedure would necessarily lead to a dif-\nferent substantive result.  Id., at 572, n. 7. Pp. 6–8.\n   (b) As articulated in this Court, respondents’ claim and theory of \nstanding are twofold: First, because the HEROES Act does not sub-\nstantively authorize the Plan, the Secretary was obligated to follow \ntypical negotiated-rulemaking and notice-and-comment requirements.  \nSecond, if the  Secretary had observed those procedures, respondents \nmight have used those opportunities to convince  him not only that pro-\nceeding under the HEROES Act is unlawful, but also that he should  \ninstead adopt a different loan-forgiveness program under the Higher\nEducation Act of 1965 (HEA), and to make that program more gener-\nous to respondents than the Plan.  Respondents assert there is at least \na chance that this series of events will come to pass now if this Court \nvacates the Plan.  Pp. 8–9.\n   (c) Respondents’ standing claim most clearly fails on traceability: \nThey cannot show that their purported injury of not receiving loan re-\nlief under the HEA is fairly traceable to the Department’s (allegedly \nunlawful) decision to grant loan relief under the HEROES Act.  Pp. 9–\n15.  \n     (1) Significantly, respondents are not claiming that they are in-\njured by not being sufficiently included among the Plan’s  beneficiaries: \nThey think the Plan is substantively unlawful and instead seek debt \nforgiveness under the HEA.  But a decision regarding the lawfulness  \n\n  Cite as:  600 U. S. ____ (2023)  3 \n \nSyllabus  \nof the Plan does not directly affect respondents’ ability to obtain loan \nrelief under the HEA; the Department’s authority to grant loan relief \nunder the HEA (upon which the Court does not pass) is not affected by \nwhether the Plan is lawful or unlawful.  Any connection between loan \nforgiveness under the two statutes is speculative.   \n   While it is true that the Court’s procedural-standing case law toler-\nates uncertainty over whether observing certain procedures would \nhave led to (caused) a different substantive outcome, see Lujan, 504  \nU. S., at 572, n.  7, the causal uncertainty here is not so limited.  In-\nstead, the uncertainty concerns whether the substantive  decisions the  \nDepartment has made regarding the Plan under the HEROES Act  \nhave a causal relationship with other substantive  decisions respond-\nents want the Department to make under the HEA.  There is no prec-\nedent for tolerating this sort of causal uncertainty.  Respondents can-\nnot show that the denial of HEA loan relief—their ostensible injury—\n“fairly can be traced to” the Department’s decision to grant loan relief \nin the Plan.  Simon v.  Eastern Ky. Welfare Rights Organization, 426  \nU. S. 26, 42–43.  There is little reason to think that the Department’s  \ndiscretionary decision to pursue one mechanism of loan relief under \nthe HEROES Act has anything to do with its discretionary decision to \npursue (or not pursue) action under the HEA.  “The line of causation  \nbetween” the Department’s promulgation of the Plan and respondents’ \nlack of benefits under the HEA “is attenuated at best,” Allen v.  Wright, \n468 U. S. 737, 757, and all too dependent  on “ ‘conjecture,’ ” Summers  \n   \nv. Earth Island Institute, 555 U. S. 488, 496.  Pp. 10–13. \n     (2) Respondents’ attempts to tie the Plan to potential HEA relief  \nare unavailing.  Although the Department has occasionally referred to \n“one-time” student-loan relief in publicizing the Plan, the Plan itself \ncontains no such reference.   And any incidental effect of  the Plan on  \nthe likelihood that the Department will undertake a separate loan- \nforgiveness program under  a different statute is too weak and specu-\nlative to show that the absence of HEA-based loan forgiveness is fairly \ntraceable to the Plan.  See, e.g., Simon, 426 U. S., at 42–43.  To the  \nextent the Department has determined that the Plan crowds out other \nefforts to forgive student loans, that determination is a discretionary \none that respondents may petition the Department to reconsider.  Fi-\nnally, respondents cannot demonstrate causation on the theory that \nthe Department’s failure to observe the requisite procedural rules cost \nthem a chance to obtain debt forgiveness; they do not want debt for-\ngiveness under the HEROES Act, and nothing the Department has \ndone deprives them of a chance to seek debt forgiveness under the \nHEA.  Respondents cannot meaningfully connect the absence of loan  \nrelief under the HEA to the adoption of the Plan, so they have failed to \nshow that their injury is fairly traceable to the Plan.

Readers are requested to notify the Reporter of  \nDecisions, Supreme Court of  the United States, Washington, D.

MYRA BROWN, ET  AL. \nON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \nAPPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT  \n[June 30, 2023] \nJUSTICE ALITO delivered the opinion of the Court. \n  In August 2022, the Secretary of Education announced a \nlarge-scale student-loan forgiveness program.  He pledged \nto discharge hundreds of billions of dollars in student-loan \ndebt owed by millions of borrowers.  According to the Secre-\ntary, the discharge was necessary to alleviate hardship\ncaused by the impending resumption of loan repayments, \nwhich had been suspended during the multi-year corona-\nvirus pandemic, and he therefore invoked authority that he \nclaimed he enjoyed under the Higher Education Relief Op-\nportunities for Students Act of 2003 (HEROES Act).  117 \nStat. 904, codified at 20 U. S. C. §1070 et seq.  The following\nmonth, the Secretary directed that specific actions be taken \nto implement the loan-forgiveness plan (Plan).  The amount \nof relief available to a borrower under the Plan depends on \nvarious criteria, including the borrower’s income and the \ntype of loan the borrower holds.\n  Before the Plan took effect, however, various plaintiffs—\nincluding respondents here—sued to enjoin it.  Respond-\nents are two individual borrowers who, for different rea-\nsons, do not qualify for the maximum relief available under \n \n \n\n2  DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION v. BROWN \n   \nOpinion of the Court \nthe Plan.  They argue that the Department of Education\npromulgated the Plan without following mandatory proce-\ndures known as (1) negotiated rulemaking and (2) notice \nand comment.  The District Court held in favor of respond-\nents, and we granted certiorari before judgment to consider \nthis case alongside Biden v.  Nebraska, No. 22–506, which  \npresents a similar challenge to the Plan.\n  Ultimately, however, we do not resolve respondents’ pro-\ncedural claim because we conclude that they lack standing \nto bring it.  Accordingly, we vacate the judgment of the \nUnited States District Court for the Northern District of \nTexas and remand with instructions to dismiss.  We simul-\ntaneously deny as moot the Department’s application for a \nstay pending appeal. \nI \nA \n  The Court’s opinion in  Biden v. Nebraska, ___ U. S. ___ \n(2023), recounts the relevant background of the HEROES\nAct, so only a brief summary is provided here.  The Act au-\nthorizes the Secretary of Education “to waive or modify any \nprovision” applicable to federal “student financial assis-\ntance” programs “as may be necessary to ensure that . . . \nrecipients of student financial assistance” who live or work \nin a declared disaster area, or suffer direct economic hard-\nship as a result of a national emergency, “are not placed in \na worse position financially in relation to that financial as-\nsistance because” of the disaster or emergency.  20 U. S. C. \n§§1098bb(a)(1), (a)(2)(A), 1098ee(2)(C)–(D). \n  In addition to this substantive grant of authority, the \nHEROES  Act dispenses with certain procedural rules for  \nactions taken pursuant to it.\n  First, the HEROES Act permits the Secretary to imple-\nment  any  “waivers  and  modifications  authorized  or  re-\nquired” by the Act without engaging in the “negotiated rule-\nmaking”  that  is  typically  required  before  proposing  \n \n\n  Cite as:  600 U. S. ____ (2023)  3 \n \nOpinion of the Court \nregulations  relating  to  student  financial  assistance.   \n§1098bb(d).  Negotiated rulemaking is a lengthy delibera-\ntive process involving many stakeholders.  Pursuant to this \nprocess, the Secretary must first obtain “advice of and rec-\nommendations” from a long list of sources, including “indi-\nviduals and representatives” of groups “such as students, \nlegal assistance organizations that represent students, in-\nstitutions of higher education, State student grant agen-\ncies, guaranty agencies, lenders,  secondary markets, loan \nservicers, guaranty agency servicers, and collection agen-\ncies.”  §1098a(a)(1).  Then, informed by this consultation, \nthe Secretary must submit draft regulations for considera-\ntion in a negotiation process involving participants who are \n“chosen by the Secretary from individuals nominated by” \nsuch groups.  §1098a(b)(1).  Only after taking these steps \nmay the Secretary “publis[h] proposed regulations in the \nFederal Register,” ibid., accompanied by a summary of the \ninformation the Secretary received throughout the process, \n§1098a(a)(2). The HEROES Act, however, permits the Sec-\nretary to bypass this onerous process.  §1098bb(d). \n  The HEROES Act also authorizes the Secretary to bypass \nnotice-and-comment  procedures  that  the  Administrative  \nProcedure Act (APA) would otherwise demand.  The APA \ntypically requires agencies to give the public “[g]eneral no-\ntice of [a] proposed rule making” by publication in the Fed-\neral Register, and then to provide “interested persons an \nopportunity to participate in the rule making through sub-\nmission of written data, views, or arguments” regarding the \nproposed rule.  5 U. S. C. §§553(b), (c).  The agency may \npromulgate a final rule only after providing notice and op-\nportunity for comment.  §553(c).  But the HEROES Act in-\nstead permits the Secretary to implement the waivers and \nmodifications he “deems necessary to achieve the purposes \nof ” the Act  merely by “publish[ing]” “notice in the Federal \n \nRegister.”  20 U. S. C. §1098bb(b)(1). \n \n\n4  DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION v. BROWN \n   \nOpinion of the Court \nB \n  On September 27, 2022, Secretary of Education Miguel \nCardona, invoking authority under the HEROES Act, di-\nrected the issuance of waivers and modifications that would \nbring  about  the  forgiveness  of  a  substantial  amount  of  \nstudent-loan debt.  In particular, he purported to effect the \ndischarge of (1) $10,000 of eligible, federally held student-\nloan debt for any individual borrower with 2020 or 2021 in-\ncome  under  $125,000  (or  household  income  under \n$250,000), and (2) an additional $10,000 (making a total of \n$20,000) for any such borrower who had ever received a Pell \nGrant.  Pell Grants are Government-funded grants to help \ndefray the cost of postsecondary education; eligibility for \nthese grants turns principally on the income of a student’s \nfamily when the student applies to and is enrolled in the \nrelevant educational program (almost always undergradu-\nate study). See §§1070a(b)(2), 1087mm(a), 1091; see also 34 \nCFR §690.6(c) (2022) (limited eligibility for students in a \nqualifying “postbaccalaureate program”).  Secretary Car-\ndona directed that these actions be taken via a publication \nin the Federal Register, see App. 262; all agree that he did\nnot observe the generally applicable negotiated-rulemaking \nor notice-and-comment processes in devising and announc-\ning the Plan.\n  Notwithstanding the Plan’s scope and expense, not all \nstudent-loan borrowers were pleased with it.  Myra Brown \nand Alexander Taylor, plaintiffs in this case, are two such \ndissatisfied borrowers, albeit for different reasons.  Brown’s \nloans are “commercially held,” id., at 171, Complaint ¶10,\nmeaning that her creditor is an entity other than the Fed-\neral Government.  The Plan, however, applies only to bor-\nrowers whose loans fall into one or more categories of loans \n“held by the Department.”  87 Fed. Reg. 61513 (2022).  Con-\nsequently, Brown is not entitled to any loan forgiveness un-\nder the Plan. \n \n\n  Cite as:  600 U. S. ____ (2023)  5 \n \nOpinion of the Court \n  Taylor,  on  the  other  hand,  is  eligible  for  loan  for-\ngiveness—but  only  $10,000,  rather  than  the  maximum\n$20,000.  That is because, despite now having an annual\nincome of less than $25,000, he never received a Pell Grant.  \nSee App. 183, Complaint ¶61.  Thus, individuals with an-\nnual income up to five times greater than his are eligible for \ntwice as much loan forgiveness as he is if they ever received \na Pell Grant. \n  Accordingly, both Brown and Taylor object to certain ele-\nments of the Plan—Brown to its limitation to federally held \nloans, and Taylor to the additional relief it doles out based \non prior Pell Grants, with no regard for current income.  Be-\ncause the Department did not engage in negotiated rule-\nmaking or notice and comment, however, Brown and Taylor \nhad no formal opportunity to voice their views on the Plan\nprior to its adoption.\n  Alleging that the law entitles them to such an oppor-\ntunity, Brown and Taylor brought this action in the U. S. \nDistrict Court for the Northern District of Texas.  Their  \none-count complaint claims that the Plan is unlawful be-\ncause the Department promulgated it without observing \nthe requirements of negotiated rulemaking and notice and \ncomment.  As a result, they claim, we should “[v]acate and \nset aside the” Plan under 5 U. S. C. §706(2)(D).  App. 186.\n  Brown and Taylor recognize that the HEROES Act sup-\nplies  exemptions  from  these  procedural  requirements.   \nThey argue, however, that an action of the Secretary falls \nwithin these exemptions only if it is substantively author-\nized by the Act; the Secretary, in their view, cannot merely \ninvoke the “HEROES Act” to bypass negotiated rulemaking \nand notice and comment.  According to Brown and Taylor, \nthe Act does not substantively authorize the Plan, and so \nthe Secretary was required to follow these procedures. \n  The District Court agreed with Brown and Taylor—in  \npart. It rebuffed their central argument that the HEROES \n \n\n6  DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION v. BROWN \n   \nOpinion of the Court \nAct exempts from procedural requirements only those ac-\ntions that the Act substantively authorizes.  But the Dis-\ntrict Court nonetheless held that the Plan exceeds the Sec-\nretary’s authority under the HEROES Act and therefore \nentered judgment vacating it.  ___ F. Supp. 3d ___, ___,  \n2022 WL 16858525, *15 (ND Tex., Nov. 10, 2022). \n  After the Fifth Circuit denied the Department’s motion \nfor a stay pending appeal, the Department applied to this \nCourt for such a stay.  The Department advised in the al-\nternative that we could treat its application as a petition for \ncertiorari before judgment.  We did just that, granting the \nDepartment’s petition for certiorari before judgment and \ndeferring consideration of its application for a stay.  598  \nU. S. ___ (2022).  We now review the judgment in No. 22–\n535 and dispose of the pending application in No. 22A489. \nII  \n  We ultimately do not address Brown and Taylor’s argu-\nment that the Department failed to observe proper proce-\ndures in promulgating the Plan.  “We have ‘an obligation to\nassure ourselves’ of litigants’ standing under Article III” be-\nfore proceeding to the merits of a case.  DaimlerChrysler \nCorp. v. Cuno, 547 U. S. 332, 340 (2006) (quoting  Friends of  \nthe Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Environmental Services (TOC),  \nInc., 528 U. S. 167, 180 (2000)).  And because we conclude \nthat Brown and Taylor lack standing, “[t]his case begins \nand ends with standing.”  Carney v. Adams, 592 U. S. ___,  \n___ (2020) (slip op., at 4).  In particular, we hold that Brown \nand Taylor fail to establish that any injury they suffer from \nnot having their loans forgiven is fairly traceable to the \nPlan. \nA \n  Our authority under the Constitution is limited to resolv-\ning “Cases” or “Controversies.”  Art. III, §2.  “The doctrine \nof standing,” among others, “implements this” limit on our \n \n\n  Cite as:  600 U. S. ____ (2023)  7 \n \nOpinion of the Court \nauthority.  Carney, 592 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 4).  Our \njurisprudence has “established that the irreducible consti-\ntutional minimum of standing contains three elements” \nthat a plaintiff must plead and—ultimately—prove.  Lujan  \nv. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U. S. 555, 560 (1992).  “First,  \nthe plaintiff must have suffered an ‘injury in fact’” that is \n \nboth “concrete and particularized” and “actual or imminent, \nnot conjectural or hypothetical.”  Ibid. (some internal quo-\ntation marks omitted).  Second, the plaintiff ’s injury must \n \nbe “fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defend-\nant,” meaning that “there must be a causal connection be-\ntween the injury and the conduct complained of.”  Ibid. (in-\nternal quotation marks and alterations omitted).  “Third, it  \nmust be ‘likely,’ as opposed to merely ‘speculative,’ that the \ninjury will be redressed by a favorable decision.”  Id., at 561 \n(some internal quotation marks omitted). \n  We have found, however, that when a statute affords a  \nlitigant “a procedural right to protect his concrete inter-\nests,”  the  litigant  may  establish  Article  III  jurisdiction \nwithout meeting the usual “standards for redressability\nand immediacy.” Id., at 572, n. 7.  For example, we hypoth-\nesized a person “living adjacent to the site for proposed con-\nstruction of a federally licensed dam” and explained that \nthis  person  “has  standing  to  challenge  the  licensing \nagency’s failure to prepare an environmental impact state-\nment, even though he cannot establish with any certainty \nthat the statement will cause the license to be withheld or \naltered.”  Ibid.  In this context, the fact that the defendant \nmight well come to the same decision after abiding by the \ncontested procedural requirement does not deprive a plain-\ntiff of standing.\n  Regardless of the redressability showing we have toler-\nated in the procedural-rights context, we have never held a \nlitigant who asserts such a right is excused from demon-\nstrating that it has a “concrete interest that is affected by \nthe deprivation” of the claimed right.  Summers v. Earth \n \n\n8  DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION v. BROWN \n   \nOpinion of the Court \nIsland Institute, 555 U. S. 488, 496–497 (2009). \n  We emphasized this requirement in Summers, where we \nwere asked to review U. S. Forest Service regulations ex-\nempting certain minor land-management decisions from \nthe typical notice-and-comment process.  Id., at 490–491.   \nThe plaintiffs in that case did not have any “concrete plans \nto observe nature in [a] specific area” affected by actions the \nService took pursuant to this exemption, id., at 497, and we  \ntherefore held that they lacked standing, id., at 494–497.  \nAs we put it, the “deprivation of a procedural right without \nsome concrete interest that is affected by the deprivation—\na procedural right in vacuo—is insufficient to create Article  \nIII standing.”  Id., at 496. \nB \n  Before applying this framework, we pause to explain both \nrespondents’ theory of standing and the substance of their \nclaim, which have not always been readily ascertainable—\nor consistently described—during this litigation. \n  Upon initial inspection, respondents’ merits theory ap-\npears to be in tension with the possibility that the Depart-\nment could redress their injury. Respondents argue simul-\ntaneously (1) that the Department might have treated them \nmore generously if it had solicited their input in developing \nthe Plan and (2) that  the Department lacks substantive au-\nthority to promulgate broad-based loan forgiveness under \nthe HEROES Act. It would be quite odd for Brown and Tay-\nlor to complain about being unable to seek an increase in\nthe scope of an administrative action that they think the \nDepartment cannot lawfully take. \n  Respondents belatedly attempted to address this strange \nfeature of their argument.  Their complaint does not say a  \nword about standing.  But in their reply supporting their \nmotion in the District Court for an injunction against the \nPlan, they ventured a brief attempt to explain their position \non this threshold issue.  They insisted that the Department \n \n\n  Cite as:  600 U. S. ____ (2023)  9 \n \nOpinion of the Court \ncannot adopt the Plan under the HEROES Act regardless \nof the procedures it follows.  Reply in No. 4:22–cv–908  \n(ND Tex., Oct. 20, 2022), ECF Doc. 26, pp. 3–4.  But they\nobserved that the Department has claimed it also has au-\nthority to forgive loans under a different statute, the Higher \nEducation Act of 1965 (HEA), which authorizes the Secre-\ntary  to  “compromise,  waive,  or  release  any  right,  title, \nclaim, lien, or demand.”  20 U. S. C. §1082(a)(6).  Thus, re-\nspondents argued, there is a chance that vacating the Plan \nwould prompt the Department to pursue loan  relief under \nthe HEA instead.  In this Court,  Brown and Taylor discuss \nthe HEA at length for the first time in this litigation.  See \nBrief for Respondents 28–32.\n  Having recounted this history, we now understand re-\nspondents’ claim and theory of standing as follows.  First, \nbecause the HEROES Act does not substantively authorize \nthe Plan, the Department was obligated to follow the typi-\ncal  negotiated-rulemaking  and  notice-and-comment  re-\nquirements.  Second, if the Department had observed those \nprocedures, respondents might have used those opportuni-\nties to convince the Department (1) that proceeding under \nthe HEROES Act is unlawful or otherwise undesirable, and \n(2) that it should adopt a different loan-forgiveness plan un-\nder the HEA instead, one that is more generous to them \nthan the HEROES Act plan that they allege is unlawful.  \nThey assert there is at least a chance that this series of\nevents will come to pass now if we vacate the Plan.  Id., at \n19. \nC \n  Describing respondents’ claim illustrates how unusual it \nis.  They claim they are injured because the Government \nhas not adopted a lawful benefits program under which \nthey would qualify for assistance.  But the same could be  \nsaid of anyone who might benefit from a benefits program \nthat the Government has not chosen to adopt.  It is difficult  \n \n\n10   DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION v. BROWN \n   \nOpinion of the Court \nto see how such an injury could be particular (since all peo-\nple suffer it) or concrete (since an as-yet-uncreated benefits \nplan is necessarily “‘abstract’” and not “‘real’”).1   Spokeo, \n       \nInc. v. Robins, 578 U. S. 330, 340 (2016); see also Allen v.  \nWright, 468 U. S. 737, 755–756 (1984) (rejecting a theory \nthat would “extend [standing] nationwide”).  Nor have we \never accepted that an injury is redressable when the pro-\nspect of redress turns on the Government’s wholly discre-\ntionary decision to create a new regulatory or benefits pro-\ngram. \n  Nonetheless, we think the deficiencies of respondents’\nclaim are clearest with respect to traceability.  They cannot\nshow that their purported injury of not receiving loan relief \nunder the HEA is fairly traceable to the Department’s (al-\nlegedly unlawful) decision to grant loan relief under the \nHEROES Act.  \n1 \n  At the outset, we reiterate what respondents’ claim is not.  \nRespondents are not claiming that they are injured by not \nbeing included in the Plan (or, in Taylor’s case, by being re-\nmunerated by the Plan less generously than he thinks him-\nself entitled to).  After all, they think the Plan is substan-\ntively unlawful, a merits contention that “we accept as \nvalid” for purposes of analyzing standing.  Federal Election \nComm’n v. Ted  Cruz for Senate, 596 U. S. ___, ___ (2022) \n(slip op., at 6).  It would be quite strange to think that a \nparty experiences an Article III injury by not being affected \nby an unlawful action (in Brown’s case) or not being more \naffected by such action (in Taylor’s). \n  Instead, respondents seek relief under a separate statu-\ntory source.  They name the HEA  as that potential source, \nbut presumably they would be pleased for the Department  \n—————— \n1In contrast, a claim of unlawful exclusion from an existing benefits  \n \nprogram  can be fit for judicial resolution.  See,  e.g., Trinity Lutheran  \nChurch of Columbia, Inc. v.  Comer, 582 U. S. 449, 462 (2017).  \n \n\n  Cite as:  600 U. S. ____ (2023)  11  \n \nOpinion of the Court \nto invoke any other lawful source (if one exists) as grounds \nfor granting them loan  relief.  Their interest is in obtaining \nloan forgiveness in general. \n  The Plan, however, is independent of any student-loan \nrelief the Department might craft under the HEA (or any \nother statute).  A decision by this Court that the Plan is \nlawful would have no effect on the Department’s ability to \nforgive respondents’ loans under the HEA.2 Thus, the Plan \nposes no legal obstacle to the Department’s choosing to find \nother ways to remedy the harm respondents experience \nfrom not having their loans forgiven.\n  Put differently, the Department’s decision to give other \npeople relief under a different statutory scheme did not \ncause  respondents not to obtain the benefits they want.  The  \ncause of their supposed injury is far more pedestrian than \nthat: The Department has simply chosen not to give them  \nthe relief they want.   Ordinarily,  a party’s recourse to in-\nduce an agency to take a desired action is to file not a law-\nsuit, but a “petition for the issuance, amendment, or repeal \nof a rule.”  5 U. S. C. §553(e).  The denial of such a petition \n“must be justified by a statement of reasons,” which in turn \n“can be appealed to the courts” if the litigant has standing \nto maintain such a suit. Auer v. Robbins, 519 U. S. 452, 459  \n(1997).  Contesting a separate benefits program based on a \ntheory that it crowds out the desired one, however, is an \napproach for which we  have been unable to find any prece-\ndent. \n  It is true that in procedural-standing cases, we tolerate\nuncertainty  over  whether  observing  certain  procedures \nwould have led to (caused) a different substantive outcome,\nas with Lujan’s example of the dam and the bypassed envi-\nronmental impact statement.  See 504 U. S., at 572, n. 7.  In  \n—————— \n2We do not opine on the substantive lawfulness of any action the De-\n \npartment might take under the HEA or add anything to our construction \nof the HEROES Act as set forth in today’s opinion in Nebraska. \n \n\n12   DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION v. BROWN \n   \nOpinion of the Court \nthis case, however, the causal uncertainty is not merely \nover whether observing certain procedures would have led \nto a different substantive outcome.  Instead, the uncer-\ntainty concerns whether the substantive decisions the De-\npartment has made regarding the Plan under the HEROES \nAct have a causal relationship with other substantive deci-\nsions respondents want the Department to make under the \nHEA. There is no precedent for tolerating this sort of causal \nuncertainty. \n  Our  other  procedural-standing  cases  demonstrate  the \npoint.  In the example posited in Lujan, proceeding with\nbuilding the dam as planned and simultaneously sparing \nthe adjacent landowner from the negative effects of the dam \nare mutually exclusive options. See ibid.  While it might be  \nuncertain whether undertaking an environmental impact \nstatement would prevent the dam from being built, it is \nclear that building the dam would directly injure the land-\nowner. \n  Similarly, in a case like Summers, it might be uncertain \nwhether public comment would alter any particular land-\nmanagement decision the Forest Service makes.  There \nwould be no uncertainty, however, that a plaintiff with con-\ncrete plans to observe nature in a particular area “would be \nharmed  if  the  [land-management  project]  went  forward\nwithout  incorporation  of  the  ideas  he  would  have  sug-\ngested” in his comments.  555 U. S., at 494.3  \n  Accordingly, Brown and Taylor need not allege that ob-\nserving negotiated rulemaking and notice and comment \nwould “‘force’” the Department to reach substantive results \n   \nmore favorable to them than those embodied in the Plan.   \n—————— \n3Although no plaintiff in Summers had standing because none had al-\n \nleged specific plans to observe nature  in one of the areas at issue in the \ncase, see 555 U. S., at 500, the point remains that, in an equivalent case \nfeaturing those specific plans, environmental damage to such a plain-\ntiff  ’s esthetic interests could fairly be traced to the Service’s land- \nmanagement choices. \n \n\n  Cite as:  600 U. S. ____ (2023)  13  \n \nOpinion of the Court \nLemon v. Geren, 514 F.  3d 1312, 1314–1315 (CADC 2008).  \nBut they must still show—pursuant to our customary trace-\nability standards—that the Plan’s substance causes their \ninjury by impairing loan relief under the HEA. \n  Brown and Taylor cannot meet this standard.  “It is  \npurely speculative whether the denia[l]” of HEA loan re-\nlief—their ostensible injury—“fairly can be traced to” the \nDepartment’s decision to grant loan relief in the Plan.  Si-\nmon v. Eastern Ky. Welfare Rights Organization, 426 U. S.  \n26, 42–43 (1976); see also Warth v. Seldin, 422 U. S. 490, \n503–504 (1975).\n  As noted above, HEROES Act loan relief and HEA loan \nrelief function independently of each other.  If the Depart-\nment  may  lawfully  grant  loan  relief  under  both  the  \nHEROES  Act and the HEA, it is entitled to choose to do \nboth, neither, or only one (provided that it sufficiently ex-\nplains its reasoning, see 5 U. S. C. §706(2)(A)).  There is lit-\ntle reason to think that its discretionary decision to pursue \none mechanism of loan relief has anything to do with its \ndiscretionary decision to pursue (or not pursue) another.  \n“The line of causation between” the Department’s promul-\ngation of the Plan and respondents’ lack of benefits under \nthe HEA “is attenuated at best,” Allen, 468 U. S., at 757,  \nand  all  too  dependent  on  “‘conjecture,’”  Summers,  555 \n   \nU. S., at 496. \n2 \n  Respondents’ attempts to tie the Plan to potential HEA \nrelief are unavailing.  They point to a handful of documents \nrelated to the Plan that say that the Department is provid-\ning “one-time” student-loan relief.  See, e.g., App. 215, 221, \n225.  Such statements, Brown and Taylor argue, show that \nthe decision to grant loan relief under the HEROES  Act \nforeclosed HEA relief. \n  This is insufficient.  The Plan itself—the action under re-\nview here—contains no reference to “one-time” relief.  See \n \n\n14   DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION v. BROWN \n   \nOpinion of the Court \n87 Fed. Reg. 61512–61514.  And to the extent that the De-\npartment’s decision to adopt the Plan under the HEROES \nAct might have some incidental effect on the likelihood that \nthe Department will undertake a separate loan-forgiveness \nprogram under a different statute, the relationship is not \nsufficiently close to persuade us that the latter is fairly  \ntraceable to the former.  See, e.g., Simon, 426 U. S., at 42– \n43 (accepting that certain tax rules might “‘encourag[e]’” or \n   \n“‘discourage’” particular behavior, but nonetheless holding \n   \nthat  connection  to  be  insufficient  to  establish  standing \nwhere it was “just as plausible” that actors would “forgo fa-\nvorable tax treatment”).  Moreover, no one argues that the \nexisting references to one-time relief are legally binding.  To \nwhatever extent the Department has determined that the \nPlan crowds out other  efforts to forgive student loans, that, \ntoo, is a discretionary and independent decision that re-\nspondents may ask it to reconsider with a §553(e) petition.\n  Finally, Brown and Taylor also argue that they have \ndemonstrated causation because the Secretary’s failure to \nobserve  the  requisite  procedural  rules  cost  them  a \n“‘chance’” to “obtain debt forgiveness.”  Brief for Respond-\n   \nents 28.  But referring in the abstract to a “chance” of ob-\ntaining “debt forgiveness” does not solve their problem.  \nThey do not want debt forgiveness under the HEROES Act, \nwhich they claim is unlawful.  They want debt forgiveness \nunder the HEA.  Nothing the Secretary has done deprives \nthem of a “chance” to seek that result. \n  Because respondents cannot meaningfully connect the \nabsence of loan relief under the HEA to the adoption of the \nPlan, they have failed to show that their injury is fairly \ntraceable to the Plan. \n*  *  * \n  For these reasons, respondents lack standing, and we  \ntherefore vacate the judgment of the District Court and re-\nmand the case with instructions to dismiss.  By vacating  \n \n\n  Cite as:  600 U. S. ____ (2023)  15  \n \nOpinion of the Court \nthe District Court’s judgment, we obviate the need to grant \nthe interim relief the Department requests in its applica-\ntion in No.  22A489.  We therefore deny the application as  \nmoot. \nIt is so ordered.  \n ",

This \npower, however, can be delegated to the executive branch. But if the \nexecutive branch seeks to use that delegated power to create a law of \nvast economic and political significance, it must have clear congressional \nauthorization. If not, the executive branch unconstitutionally exercises \n“legislative powers” vested in Congress. In this case, the HEROES Act—\na law to provide loan assistance to military personnel defending our \nnation—does  not  provide  the  executive  branch  clear  congressional \nauthorization to create a $400 billion student loan forgiveness program. \nThe  Program  is  thus  an  unconstitutional  exercise  of  Congress’s \nlegislative power and must be vacated.1 \n \n1 The Court expresses no opinion on whether the Program constitutes sound or \nunsound public policy—a consideration inappropriate for the Court to contemplate—\nas it falls outside the Court’s task of merely interpreting the law. See Harris v. Harris, \n72 Va. (31 Gratt.) 13, 32 (1878) (“‘Compassion,’ said an eminent Virginia chancellor, \n‘ought not to influence a judge, in whom, acting officially, apathy is less a vice than \nsympathy.’”  (quoting  Chancellor  George  Wythe,  Commentary  on  Field’s  Ex’x  v. \nHarrison & Wife, Wythe’s Reports 282 (Minor’s Ed. 1794))); see also Letter from \nThomas Jefferson to Edmund Pendelton (Aug. 26, 1776), reprinted in 1 THE PAPERS OF \nTHOMAS JEFFERSON 505 (Julian P.

The mercies of the law will be dispensed \nequally and impartially to every description of men; those of the judge, or of the \nexecutive power, will be the eccentric impulses of whimsical, capricious designing \nmen.”). \n\nCase 4:22-cv-00908-P   Document 37   Filed 11/10/22    Page 2 of 26   PageID 540\nBACKGROUND \nA. Title IV of the Higher Education Act \nThe Department of Education (“Department”) offers two types of \nfinancial aid to help students pay for their college education—grants \nand loans.2 Grants do not have to be repaid. Id. But loans do. Id. Title \nIV  of  the  Higher  Education  Act  of  1965  (“HEA”)  covers  the \nadministration of three types of federal student loans: (1) Direct Loans; \n(2) Federal Family Education Loans (“FFEL”); and (3) Perkins Loans. \nSee 20 U.S.C. § 1070. \nWith Direct Loans, the federal government provides loans directly to \nborrowers, who are responsible for repaying the government. See 20 \nU.S.C. § 1087a. With FFEL, the federal government pays lenders to offer \nstudent loans, and the federal government guarantees their repayment. \n20 U.S.C. § 1071. With Perkins Loans, colleges loan money to students, \nand the federal government guarantees their repayment. § 1087aa. The \nHEA also provides how to pay these loans, repayment options, and loan \nforgiveness.  See,  e.g.,  34  C.F.R.  § 685.219;  20  U.S.C.  §§ 1098e; \n1087e(d)(1); 1078(b)(9)(A)(v). \nB. Prior Attempts to Provide Loan Forgiveness  \nWith rising college costs, federal student-loan debt has skyrocketed \nto more than $1.61 trillion with 43 million borrowers.3 As a result, there \nhave  been  multiple  attempts  to  enact  legislation  to  help  alleviate \nstudent-loan debt. For example, in 2019, Senator Elizabeth Warren \nintroduced a bill to provide $50,000 in debt forgiveness for those who \nmake  under  $100,000.  See  S.  2235,  116th  Cong.  (2019).  Similarly, \nRepresentative Al Lawson introduced a bill to forgive the outstanding \nloan balance of all borrowers who make under $100,000 individually or \n$200,000 if married and filing taxes jointly. See H.R. 2034, 117th Cong. \n(2021). But both bills failed.  \n \n2 See Types of Aid, U.S. DEP’T OF EDUC., https://bit.ly/3S51Heu (last visited Nov. \n7, 2022). \n3 Federal Student Loan Portfolio, U.S. DEP’T OF EDUC., https://bit.ly/3qYd5Nm (last \nvisited Nov. 7, 2022). \n2 \n \n\nCase 4:22-cv-00908-P   Document 37   Filed 11/10/22    Page 3 of 26   PageID 541\nThe executive branch has also recently explored its ability to forgive \nstudent loans. Specifically, the Trump administration considered its \nstatutory authority under the Higher Education Relief Opportunities for \nStudents Act of 2003 (“HEROES Act”) to forgive student loans due to \nthe COVID-19 pandemic. But the Department concluded that it lacked \nsuch  authority.4  House  speaker  Nancy  Pelosi  agreed  with  the \nDepartment’s conclusion: “People think that the president of the United \nStates  has  the  power  for  debt  forgiveness. . .  He  does  not.  He  can \npostpone, he can delay, but he does not have that power. That has to be \n[accomplished through] an act of Congress.”5  \nPresident Biden, however, promised to “forgive all undergraduate \ntuition-related  federal  student  debt  from  two-  and  four-year  public \ncolleges and universities for debt-holders earning up to $125,000” while \ncampaigning  for  the  presidency.6  After  becoming  president,  Biden \ninstructed  the  Department  to  prepare  a  memorandum  exploring \npossible legal avenues to justify a loan forgiveness program.7  \nThe Department did so but changed its tune—concluding that the \nHEROES Act allows the executive branch to create a loan-forgiveness \nprogram to address the financial harms of the COVID-19 pandemic.8 \nThe next day, the White House announced that the President would \n“fulfill [his] campaign commitment” by providing debt forgiveness to \nmillions of borrowers.9 \n \n \n4 See Reed Rubinstein, Memorandum to Betsy DeVos Secretary of Education, U.S. \nDEP’T  OF  EDUC.

The HEROES Act \nThe HEROES Act grants the Secretary of Education (“Secretary”) \nthe authority to “waive or modify any statutory or regulatory provision \napplicable to the student financial assistance programs under title IV of \nthe Act [20 U.S.C. 1070 et seq.] as the Secretary deems necessary in \nconnection  with  a  war  or  other  military  operation  or  national \nemergency.” § 1098bb(a)(1) (alteration in original). “The term ‘national \nemergency’ means a national emergency declared by the President of the \nUnited States.” § 1098ee(4). \nThe waiver or modification must also “be necessary to ensure that” \ncertain  objectives  are  achieved.  § 1098bb(a)(2).  The  first  of  those \nobjectives is “to ensure that . . . recipients of student financial assistance \nunder title IV of the [HEA] who are affected individuals are not placed \nin a worse position financially in relation to that financial assistance \nbecause of their status as affected individuals.” § 1098bb(a)(2)(A). The \nHEROES Act defines “affected individuals” to include people who reside \nor are employed “in an area that is declared a disaster area by any \nFederal, State, or local official in connection with a national emergency” \nor who “suffered direct economic hardship as a direct result of a war or \nother military operation or national emergency, as determined by the \nSecretary.” § 1098ee(2)(C)–(D). \nThe  second  objective  provides  that  “administrative  requirements \nplaced on affected individuals . . . are minimized, to the extent possible \nwithout  impairing  the  integrity  of  the  student  financial  assistance \nprograms, to ease the burden on such students and avoid inadvertent, \ntechnical violations or defaults.” § 1098bb(a)(2).10 If the objectives of \n§ 1098bb(a)(2) are met, “[n]otwithstanding section 1232 of this title and \nsection 553 of title 5, the Secretary shall, by notice in the Federal \nRegister, publish the waivers or modification.” § 1098bb(b)(1). \n \n \n \n10 The HEROES Act provides three additional objectives. § 1098bb(a)(2)(C)–(E). \nNone of which are at issue or relevant to the Court’s analysis. \n4 \n \n\nCase 4:22-cv-00908-P   Document 37   Filed 11/10/22    Page 5 of 26   PageID 543\nD. Student-Loan Program \nThe Secretary invoked its authority under the HEROES Act to create \na  loan-forgiveness  program  (“Program”)  that  would  address  the \nfinancial harms of the COVID-19 pandemic.11 The Secretary contends \nthat  COVID-19  pandemic  was  declared  a  national  emergency  by \nPresident Trump in 2020 and thus a “national emergency” under the \nHEROES Act. Id. And according to the Secretary, every portion of the \ncountry is a “disaster area due to COVID-19,” and “every person with a \nfederal student loan under title IV of the HEA” is an affected individual. \nId. \nBecause the Secretary deemed the objectives of § 1098bb(a)(2) met, \nthe Secretary provided notice of the waivers and modifications in the \nFederal Register. Id. The notice provided that the Secretary modifies “20 \nU.S.C. 1087, which applies to the Direct Loan Program under 20 U.S.C. \n1087a and 1087e; 20 U.S.C. 1087dd(g); and 34 CFR part 674, subpart D, \nand 34 CFR 682.402 and 685.212” to provide the debt relief for certain \nborrowers who qualify. Id. A borrower qualifies if he (1) individually \nmakes under $125,000 or $250,000 if married and filing taxes jointly \nand (2) has Direct, Perkins, or FFEL loans that are not commercially \nheld. Id. If a borrower qualifies, the Program provides $20,000 in debt \nforgiveness to those who have received a Pell Grant and $10,000 to those \nwho did not. Id. \nE. Procedural History \n1.

Id. at 2–3. \nBrown  and  Taylor,  however,  could  not  voice  their  disagreement \nbecause the Program did not undergo notice-and-comment rulemaking \nprocedures under the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”).12 As a \nresult, Plaintiffs sued the Department and Secretary, seeking vacatur \nof the Program or nationwide injunctive relief for two reasons. First, \nthey allege that the Program violates the APA’s notice-and-comment \nrequirements. ECF No. 1 at 13–14. Second, they also contend that the \nSecretary lacks the  authority to implement the Program under the \nHEROES Act. Id. at 4–5.  \nThe same day Plaintiffs sued, they moved to enjoin the Department \n“from enforcing, applying, or implementing the Program.” ECF No. 4 at \n14. Shortly after, Defendants filed their opposition to Plaintiffs’ motion. \nECF No. 24. \n2.  Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Jurisdiction \nAlong with opposing Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction, \nDefendants moved to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, contending that \nPlaintiffs lack standing.

Second, whether the Court has jurisdiction. \nAnd third, whether Plaintiffs are entitled to relief. The Court addresses \neach in turn.  \nLEGAL STANDARD \nA preliminary injunction is an “extraordinary remedy” and will be \ngranted only if the movants carry their burden on four requirements. \nNichols v. Alcatel USA, Inc., 532 F.3d 364, 372 (5th Cir. 2008). The \nmovants  must  show:  “(1)  a  substantial likelihood  of  success  on  the \nmerits; (2) a substantial threat of irreparable injury; (3) the threatened \ninjury to the movant outweighs the threatened harm to the party sought \nto be enjoined; and (4) granting the injunctive relief will not disserve the \npublic interest.” City of Dall. v. Delta Airlines, Inc., 847 F.3d 279, 285 \n(5th Cir. 2017) (quotation omitted). “The decision to grant or deny a \npreliminary injunction is discretionary with the district court.” Miss. \nPower & Light Co. v. United Gas Pipe Line Co., 760 F.2d 618, 621 (5th \nCir. 1985). \nSummary judgment is appropriate if “there is no genuine dispute as \nto any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter \nof law.” FED. R. CIV. P. 56(a). A fact is “material” if it could change the \noutcome of the litigation. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, \n248 (1986). And a dispute about a material fact is “genuine” if “the \nevidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the \nnonmoving party.” Id. The Court views the evidence in the light most \nfavorable to the nonmovant but need not comb through the record in \nsearch  of  evidence  creating  a  genuine  issue  of  material  fact.  See \nMalacara v. Garber, 353 F.3d 393, 405 (5th Cir. 2003).  \n \n7 \n \n\nCase 4:22-cv-00908-P   Document 37   Filed 11/10/22    Page 8 of 26   PageID 546\nANALYSIS \nA. Proceeding to the Merits is Appropriate \nUnder Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65, “[b]efore or after beginning \nthe hearing on a motion for a preliminary injunction, the court may \nadvance the trial on the merits and consolidate it with the hearing.” FED. \nR. CIV. P. 65(a)(2) (emphasis added). But if “the eventual outcome on the \nmerits is plain at the preliminary injunction stage, the judge should, \nafter  due  notice to  the  parties,  merge  the  stages  and  enter a  final \njudgment.” Curtis 1000, Inc. v. Suess, 24 F.3d 941, 945 (7th Cir. 1994) \n(emphasis added). Courts typically require that the parties “receive \nclear and unambiguous notice [of the court’s intent to consolidate the \ntrial and the hearing] either before the hearing commences or at a time \nwhich will still afford the parties a full opportunity to present their \nrespective cases.” Univ. of Tex. v. Camenisch, 451 U.S. 390, 395 (1981) \n(quoting Pughsley v. 3750 Lake Shore Drive Coop. Bldg., 463 F.2d 1055, \n1057 (7th Cir. 1972)) (alteration in original). Courts may also consolidate \nwithout giving the parties notice if the lack of notice is not prejudicial to \neither party. See Wohlfahrt v. Mem’l Med. Ctr., 658 F.2d 416, 418 (5th \nCir. 1981).  \nIf  consolidation  is  appropriate,  a  district  court  may  convert  a \nplaintiff’s preliminary-injunction motion into a motion for summary \njudgment. H & W Indus., Inc. v. Formosa Plastics Corp., USA, 860 F.2d \n172, 177 (5th Cir. 1988). “Summary judgment serves as ‘the mechanism \nfor deciding, as a matter of law, whether the agency action is . . . \nconsistent with the APA.’” O.A. v. Trump, 404 F. Supp. 3d 109, 125 \n(D.D.C. 2019). \n  Here, the Court provided the parties notice and an opportunity to \nobject. ECF No. 33. Defendants objected, contending that advancing to \na determination on the merits is improper for three reasons. ECF No. \n35. \nFirst, Defendants contend that Plaintiffs fail to meet the burden of \nproof at the summary-judgment stage to establish standing. Id. at 1–2. \nBut if this were true, Defendants would not be prejudiced by proceeding \n8 \n \n\nCase 4:22-cv-00908-P   Document 37   Filed 11/10/22    Page 9 of 26   PageID 547\nto the merits because the Court would rule in Defendants favor and \ndismiss the case for lack of standing. This argument thus fails. \nSecond,  Defendants  have  not  had  an  opportunity  to  conduct \njurisdictional discovery to examine Plaintiffs’ intent to participate in \nany  comment  process  and  the  substance  of  their  comments.  But \nassuming  discovery  revealed  a  fact  issue  as  to  Plaintiffs’  intent  to \nparticipate  in  any  comment  process  and  the  substance  of  their \ncomments, those issues are not material to standing or the merits. Thus, \nbecause these facts—even if resolved in Defendants’ favor—would not \n“change the outcome of the lawsuit,” this objection is similarly meritless. \nSweetin v. City of Tex. City, 48 F.4th 387, 391 (5th Cir. 2022).  \nThird, Defendants have not yet produced the data underlying the \nSecretary’s  decision.  ECF  No.  35  at  3–4.  Like  Defendants’  second \nobjection, the data underlying the Secretary’s decision is not material. \nPlaintiffs’  central  arguments  are  whether  the  Secretary  lacks  the \nauthority for the Program and whether the Program had to go through \nnotice-and-comment procedures before the Secretary implemented the \nProgram. The data underlying the Secretary’s decision—while part of \nthe administrative record—is not material to either issue. See Sierra \nClub v. U.S. Fish & Wildlife Serv., 245 F.3d 434, 441 (5th Cir. 2001) \n(stating that an issue of statutory construction is “a task which we are \ncompetent to perform without the administrative record”); Alphapointe \nv. Dep’t of Veterans Affs., 475 F. Supp. 3d 1, 12 (D.D.C. 2020) (stating \nthat resolving the plaintiffs’ notice-and-comment challenge “requires no \nobvious need for the administrative record”). \nThe cases on which Defendants rely are not to the contrary. In each \ncase, the issue was whether the agency’s actions were “arbitrary and \ncapricious,” which concerns the reasonability of an agency’s decision-\nmaking process. See ECF No. 35 at 3–4; Citizens to Pres. Overton Park, \nInc. v. Volpe, 401 U.S. 402, 414 (1971), abrogated by Califano v. Sanders, \n430 U.S. 99, 105 (1977); Dep’t of Com. v. New York, 139 S. Ct. 2551, 2564 \n(2019). Plaintiffs bring no such claim. See ECF No. 3. Nor does the data \nunderlying  the  Secretary’s  decision  have  any  bearing  on  any  of \nPlaintiffs’ claims. So even if the data underlying the Secretary’s decision \ncreated a fact issue, that fact issue would not be material as it would not \n9 \n \n\nCase 4:22-cv-00908-P   Document 37   Filed 11/10/22    Page 10 of 26   PageID 548\n“change  the  outcome  of  the  lawsuit.”  Sweetin,  48  F.4th  at  391. \nDefendants’ third argument thus fails. \nThus, because Defendants identify no reason for delaying a judgment \nin this case, the prejudice resulting to Plaintiffs if the Court delays \nruling on the merits, no material facts are in dispute, and the issues \nhere  are  pure  questions  of  law,  the  Court  converts  Plaintiffs’ \npreliminary-injunction motion to a determination on the merits. \nB. Jurisdiction \nFor the Court to reach the merits, Plaintiffs must establish the \nCourt’s jurisdiction. See Lujan v. Defs. of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 561 \n(1992). Article III of the Constitution limits federal-court jurisdiction to \n“cases” and “controversies.” U.S. CONST. art. III, § 2. To satisfy this \nrequirement,  a  plaintiff  must  establish  that  he  has  standing—a \n“personal stake” in the lawsuit. See Davis v. Fed. Election Comm’n, 554 \nU.S. 724, 732–33 (2008). At the summary-judgment stage, a plaintiff \nmust provide evidence of “specific facts” to establish standing. Id. Mere \nallegations will not suffice. Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560 \n1.  Standing \nStanding contains three requirements. Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560. First, \nthere  must  be  a  concrete  injury  in  fact  that  is  not  conjectural  or \nhypothetical. Whitmore v. Arkansas, 495 U.S. 149, 149 (1990). Second, \nthere  must  be  causation—a  fairly  traceable  connection  between  a \nplaintiff’s injury and the complained-of conduct of the defendant. Simon \nv. E. Ky. Welfare Rts. Org., 426 U.S. 26, 41–42 (1976). Third, there must \nbe redressability—a likelihood that the requested relief will redress the \nalleged injury. See Lujan, 504 U.S. at 562. These three requirements \nconstitute the core of Article III’s case-or-controversy requirement. See \nFW/PBS,  Inc.  v.  Dallas,  493  U.S.  215,  231  (1990).  But  these \nrequirements are relaxed when a plaintiff asserts a deprivation of a \nprocedural right coupled with an associated concrete interest. See Texas \nv. United States, 809 F.3d 134, 150–51 (5th Cir. 2015). \n  Defendants insinuate that nobody has standing to challenge the \nProgram—stating, “Article III of the Constitution imposes limitations \non the judiciary. And sometimes the result is that there is executive or \n10 \n \n\nCase 4:22-cv-00908-P   Document 37   Filed 11/10/22    Page 11 of 26   PageID 549\nlegislative action for which there isn’t an appropriate plaintiff.” ECF No. \n32 at 57. Defendants’ main contention, however, is that Plaintiffs lack \nstanding. ECF No. 24 at 8. Thus, the Court first addresses whether \nanybody has standing to challenge the Program. And if so, whether \nPlaintiffs have standing. \na.  Defendants’  Contention  that  No  One  Has  Standing  to \nChallenge the Program is Incorrect \nDefendants seem to argue that no one has standing to challenge the \nProgram because where the government is providing a benefit, nobody \nis harmed by the existence of that benefit. ECF No. 32 at 57–58. And \naccording to Defendants, “sometimes the result is that there is executive \nor legislative action for which there isn’t an appropriate plaintiff.” Id. at \n57 (emphasis added). The Court must disagree. The Supreme Court has \nrecognized  that  a  plaintiff  has  standing  to  challenge  a  government \nbenefit in many cases. See, e.g., Ne. Fla. Chapter of Associated Gen. \nContractors of Am. v. City of Jacksonville, 508 U.S. 656, 666 (1993) \n(holding that plaintiffs who did not qualify for government benefits had \nstanding); Bowsher v. Synar, 478 U.S. 714, 721, (1986) (holding that the \nfailure  to  receive benefits  is  enough  to  confer  Article  III  standing). \nBecause Defendants’ contention that no one has standing to challenge \nthe Program because it confers a benefit is incorrect, the Court next \nturns to whether Plaintiffs have standing. \nb.  Plaintiffs Have Standing \ni.  Injury in fact \nPlaintiffs allege that their concrete injury is the deprivation of their \nprocedural right under the APA to provide meaningful input on any \nproposal from the Department to forgive student-loan debt and their \naccompanying economic interest in debt forgiveness. ECF No. 4 at 12. \nAs for Plaintiffs’ alleged deprivation of their procedural right, the \nAPA requires agencies administering their delegated authority to follow \ncertain  procedures.  See  5  U.S.C.  §  553.  These  procedures  obligate \nagencies to subject their substantive rules to a notice-and-comment \nperiod unless an exception applies. Id. A plaintiff is deprived of “a \nprocedural right to protect its concrete interests” if an agency violates \n11 \n \n\nCase 4:22-cv-00908-P   Document 37   Filed 11/10/22    Page 12 of 26   PageID 550\nthe APA’s procedural requirements. Texas v. EEOC, 933 F.3d 433, 447 \n(5th Cir. 2019) (citing Summers v. Earth Island Inst., 555 U.S. 488, 496 \n(2009)). But a bare assertion of a procedural right violation is not enough \nto confer Article III standing. See Shrimpers & Fishermen of RGV v. Tex. \nComm’n on Env’t Quality, 968 F.3d 419, 426 (5th Cir. 2020). A plaintiff \nmust instead show a concrete injury stemming from that procedural \nviolation. Id. \nDefendants dispute Plaintiffs’ alleged injuries for two reasons. First, \nthey  argue  that  Plaintiffs  could  not  have  suffered  a  procedural \ndeprivation based on the lack of a notice-and-comment period because \nthe  HEROES  Act  expressly  exempts  the  APA’s notice-and-comment \nrequirement. ECF No. 24 at 8–9. Plaintiffs dispute this and argue that \nbecause the HEROES Act does not authorize the Program, the Program \nwas  promulgated  in  violation  of  the  APA’s  notice-and-comment \nrequirement. ECF No. 26 at 6–7. Because the Court must “assume, for \npurposes of the standing analysis, that [Plaintiffs are] correct on the \nmerits of [their] claim that the [Program] was promulgated in violation \nof the APA,” Plaintiffs have successfully alleged the deprivation of a \nprocedural right. EEOC, 933 F.3d at 447. \nSecond, Defendants assert, even if Plaintiffs have established the \nviolation  of  a  procedural  right,  there  is  no  accompanying  concrete \ninterest  stemming  from  that  violation.  ECF  No.  24  at  9–11.  They \ncontend that Plaintiffs’ “unhappiness that some other borrowers are \nreceiving a greater benefit than they are” is not a concrete interest. Id. \nBut this is untrue. Plaintiffs do not argue that they are injured because \nother people are receiving loan forgiveness. Their injury—no matter how \nmany people are receiving loan forgiveness—is that they personally did \nnot receive forgiveness and were denied a procedural right to comment \non the Program’s eligibility requirements. Plaintiffs need to prove only \nthe existence of an associated “concrete interest,” not a guarantee of \nconcrete harm due to the procedural violation. EEOC, 933 F.3d at 447. \nA  benefit  or  legal-entitlement  guarantee  is  not  a  prerequisite  to \nsuccessfully establishing standing in the event of a procedural-right \nviolation. See, e.g., Teton Historic Aviation Found. v. U.S. Dep’t of Def., \n785 F.3d 719, 724 (D.C. Cir. 2015). A “plaintiff suffers a constitutionally \n12 \n \n\nCase 4:22-cv-00908-P   Document 37   Filed 11/10/22    Page 13 of 26   PageID 551\ncognizable injury by the loss of an opportunity to pursue a benefit even \nthough the plaintiff may not be able to show that it was certain to receive \nthat benefit had it been accorded the lost opportunity.” Id. \nPlaintiffs have a concrete interest in having their debts forgiven to a \ngreater degree. Brown is ineligible for the Program because her loans \nare commercially held. And Taylor is ineligible for the full $20,000 in \ndebt forgiveness under the Program because he did not receive a Pell \nGrant in college. Brown and Taylor’s inability to obtain the full benefit \nof debt forgiveness under the Program flows directly from the Program’s \neligibility  requirements.  Thus,  Defendants’  procedural  error  of  not \nproviding  for  a  notice-and-comment  period—which  the  Court  must \nassume  as  true  for  standing—deprived  Plaintiffs  of  “a  non-illusory \nopportunity to pursue [the] benefit” of greater debt forgiveness and an \nopportunity to advocate for the expansion of the eligibility criteria of the \nProgram. Ecosystem  Inv. Partners v. Crosby Dredging, LLC, 729 F. \nApp’x 287, 292 (5th Cir. 2018). \nThe first requirement of Article III standing is thus met. \nii.  Causation \nSecond, Plaintiffs argue that their injury is traceable to Defendants’ \nactions  because  Plaintiffs  lost  the  chance  to  obtain  more  debt \nforgiveness, which flows directly from Defendants’ promulgation of the \nProgram’s eligibility requirements that failed to undergo a notice-and-\ncomment period. ECF No. 4 at 11–13. Defendants do not contest this \nargument. And the Court agrees with Plaintiffs.  \nA plaintiff only has standing if he can assert a “personal injury fairly \ntraceable to the defendant’s allegedly unlawful conduct.” California. v. \nTexas, 141 S. Ct. 2104, 2117 (2021). An injury is fairly traceable if a \nplaintiff’s  “lost  chance”  to  pursue  a  benefit  flows  directly  from  the \nprocedural  violation.  Ecosystem  Inv.  Partners,  729  F.  App’x  at  293. \nPlaintiffs contend that they lost their chance to pursue debt forgiveness \nby Defendants’ failure to offer a chance to comment on the Program’s \neligibility  requirements.  “This  injury—denial  of  the  opportunity  to \nparticipate—is  more  than  fairly  traceable  to  [the  agency’s]  alleged \n13 \n \n\nCase 4:22-cv-00908-P   Document 37   Filed 11/10/22    Page 14 of 26   PageID 552\ninaction (failure to publish for notice and comment).” Nat’l Treasury \nEmps. Union v. Newman, 768 F. Supp. 8, 10 (D.D.C. 1991). \nThus, the second requirement of Article III standing is met. \niii.  Redressability \nThird, Plaintiffs contend that there is at least some possibility that \nDefendants  would  reconsider  the  eligibility  requirements  of  the \nProgram  if  it  were  enjoined  or  vacated,  which  fulfills  the  lighter \nredressability requirement that applies when a procedural injury is \nalleged. ECF No. 26 at 3–4. The Court agrees. To establish standing, a \nplaintiff must normally prove that a favorable ruling would redress its \nentire injury at the hands of a defendant. See Clapper v. Amnesty Intern. \nUSA, 568 U.S. 398, 409 (2013). But “when a litigant is vested with a \nprocedural right, that litigant has standing if there is some possibility \nthat  the  requested  relief  will  prompt  the  injury-causing  party  to \nreconsider  the  decision  that  allegedly  harmed  the  litigant.” \nMassachusetts v. EPA, 549 U.S. 497, 518 (2007) (emphasis added). Even \nif this lighter standard applies, a plaintiff must still show that it is \n“likely, as opposed to merely speculative, that a favorable decision will \nredress the [injury].” S. Christian Leadership Conf. v. Sup. Ct. of State \nof La., 252 F.3d 781, 788 (5th Cir. 2001). \nIn response, Defendants argue that Plaintiffs’ alleged injury will not \nbe redressed by a favorable decision of the Court because enjoining or \nvacating the Program will not provide Plaintiffs any loan forgiveness. \nECF  No.  24  at  11.  But  Defendants  misread  the  redressability \nrequirement in the context of procedural injuries. Plaintiffs need only \nprove that there is some possibility that Defendants will reconsider the \nconfines of the Program if it is struck down in its current form. See Tex. \nv. United States, 787 F.3d 733, 754 (5th Cir. 2015). And “enjoining the \nimplementation of [the Program] until it undergoes notice and comment \ncould prompt [the Secretary] to reconsider its decision, which is all a \nlitigant must show when asserting a procedural right.” Id. at 753–54. \nBecause Plaintiffs satisfy all three Article III standing requirements, \nthey may challenge Defendants’ conduct on the merits. As a result, the \n14 \n \n\nCase 4:22-cv-00908-P   Document 37   Filed 11/10/22    Page 15 of 26   PageID 553\nCourt denies Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Jurisdiction \n(ECF No. 25). \n2.  Judicial Review \nWhen a party challenges the legality of agency action, the Court must \nalso ensure that the agency action at issue is reviewable under the APA. \nData Mktg. P’ship, LP v. U.S. Dep’t of Lab., 45 F.4th 846, 853 (5th Cir. \n2022). An agency action is reviewable if (1) there has been a final agency \naction and (2) the plaintiff’s injury is within the zone of interests of the \nstatute allegedly violated. See 5 U.S.C. § 704; Match–E–Be–Nash–She–\nWish Band of Pottawatomi Indians v. Patchak, 567 U.S. 209, 224 (2012). \nNeither party disputes that the Program is reviewable under the APA. \nStill, judicial review implicates jurisdiction. Data Mktg. P’ship, 45 F.4th \nat 853. As a result, the Court must consider whether the Program is \nreviewable under the APA to ensure that it does “not exceed the scope \nof [its] jurisdiction.” Henderson v. Shinseki, 562 U.S. 428, 434 (2011). \na.  Final Agency Action \nFinality is a “jurisdictional prerequisite of judicial review.” Data \nMktg. P’ship, 45 F.4th at 853 (quotation omitted). The APA provides a \nright  to  judicial  review  of  “final  agency  action”  unless  the  statute \nprecludes judicial review or the action falls under agency discretion. 5 \nU.S.C. § 701(a). To meet the limited agency exception, there must be \n“no meaningful standard against which to judge the agency’s exercise of \ndiscretion.”  Lincoln  v.  Vigil,  508  U.S.  182,  191  (1993)  (quotation \nomitted). Actions that fall under agency discretion are rare and only \napply when the standard of review is unclear.14 \nThe text of the HEROES Act does not preclude judicial review, and \nthe Secretary’s action falls within the Act’s plain text, which authorizes \nwaivers or modifications of various student-loan provisions. 20 U.S.C. \n \n14 See, e.g., Lincoln, 508 U.S. at 191 (1993) (holding that an agency’s use of lump-\nsum appropriation funds with no designation fell within the agency’s discretion); \nFranklin v. Massachusetts, 505 U.S. 788, 817, (1992) (holding that an agency’s decision \nto fire employee fell within the agency’s discretion); Heckler v. Chaney, 470 U.S. 821, \n830, (1985) (holding that an agency’s decision not to enforce their own policy fell within \nthe agency’s discretion).  \n \n15 \n \n\nCase 4:22-cv-00908-P   Document 37   Filed 11/10/22    Page 16 of 26   PageID 554\n§ 1098bb(a)(1). This provides a clear standard of review. Thus, neither \nexception in § 701(a) applies here.  \nFinality requires two things: (1) the action must be the ending result \nor “consummation” of the entire agency decision-making process—not a \ntentative or intermediate step in the process—and (2) the action must \ndetermine rights or obligations that produce legal consequences. U.S. \nArmy Corps of Eng’rs v. Hawkes Co., 578 U.S. 590, 597, 599 (2016).  \nBoth  conditions  of  finality  are  present.  First,  in  the  Secretary’s \nnotice, the Department spells out its decision-making process, legal \nbasis for the decision, and intent to proceed with the Program. Nothing \nin the waiver’s text reflects that the decision to implement the Program \nis provisional or still under review. Second, the action—the Program—\nforgives  around  eight  million  individuals  a  portion  of  their  legally-\nbinding student loan obligations, costing over $400 billion. This action \naffects  the  rights  and  obligations  of  millions  of  loan  recipients  and \ncarries sweeping legal consequences for federal student-loan programs \nby changing the terms of the HEA.  \nThe Agency’s action is thus final. \nb.  Zone of Interests \nAlong with the finality requirement, the Court may review an agency \naction only if a plaintiff’s interests are “arguably within the zone of \ninterests to be protected or regulated by the statute that he says was \nviolated.” Patchak, 567 U.S. at 224. A plaintiff with Article III standing \nsatisfies  the  requirement  unless  their  “interests  are  so  marginally \nrelated to or inconsistent with the purposes implicit in the statute that \nit cannot reasonably be assumed that Congress intended to permit the \nsuit.” Thompson v. N. Am. Stainless, LP, 562 U.S. 170, 177 (2011) \n(quotation omitted). But doing so is not “especially demanding,” and “the \nbenefit of any doubt goes to the plaintiff.” Patchak, 567 U.S. at 225. \nHere, Plaintiffs have Article III standing. And because the Secretary \nconsiders Plaintiffs “affected individuals” under the HEROES Act and \nare federal loan recipients excluded from the Program, they satisfy the \nzone-of-interest  test.  The  Court  may  thus  review  the  agency’s \nimplementation of the Program. \n16 \n \n\nCase 4:22-cv-00908-P   Document 37   Filed 11/10/22    Page 17 of 26   PageID 555\nC. Summary Judgment \nArticle I of the Constitution allows Congress to “delegate” some of its \nlegislative powers to administrative agencies. U.S. CONST. art. I, § 8, cl. \n3;  see  Mistretta  v.  United  States,  488  U.S.  361,  372  (1989).  When \nadministering their delegated authority, agencies must comply with the \nAPA’s procedural and substantive requirements. See 5 U.S.C. § 553. The \nprocedural requirements obligate agencies to subject their substantive \nrules to notice and comment unless an exception applies. See 5 U.S.C. § \n553. The substantive requirements “‘requires courts to hold unlawful \nand set aside agency action’ that is ‘in excess of statutory jurisdiction, \nauthority, or limitations.’” See Texas v. United States, 50 F.4th 498, 525 \n(5th Cir. 2022) (quoting 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(C)). \nPlaintiffs argue that the Program violates the APA’s procedural and \nsubstantive requirements. The Court addresses each in turn. \n1.  APA’s Procedural Requirements \nPlaintiffs  argue  that  the  Program  violates  the  APA’s  procedural \nrequirements because it did not go through notice and comment before \nimplementation. ECF No. 4 at 13. \nThe  APA  requires  agencies  to  subject  their  substantive  rules  to \nnotice and comment. See 5 U.S.C. § 553. Substantive rules “grant rights, \nimpose  obligations,  or  produce  other  significant  effects  on  private \ninterests.” Avoyelles Sportsmen’s League, Inc. v. Marsh, 715 F.2d 897, \n908 (5th Cir. 1983) (quoting Batterton v. Marshall, 648 F.2d 694, 701–\n02 (D.C. Cir. 1980)). A substantive rule is usually unenforceable if it does \nnot undergo notice and comment. Id. But if the agency’s authorizing \nstatute expressly exempts the agency’s rules from notice and comment, \nthe rule is enforceable. 5 U.S.C. § 559. \nPlaintiffs argue that the Program is a substantive rule because it \n‘“grants rights’ by promising to eliminate individuals’ debt if they meet \ncertain requirements and ‘imposes obligations’ on the Department to \nforgive debt for those who meet the requirements.” See ECF No. 4 at 14 \n(quoting W & T Offshore, Inc. v. Bernhardt, 946 F.3d 227, 237 (5th Cir. \n2019)). They rely on Bernhardt to support their argument. But this \nreliance is misplaced. In Bernhardt, the agency’s statutory authority did \n17 \n \n\nCase 4:22-cv-00908-P   Document 37   Filed 11/10/22    Page 18 of 26   PageID 556\nnot exempt the agency from notice-and-comment requirements of the \nAPA.  946  F.3d  at  237.  The  statutory  authority  here  does: \n“Notwithstanding section 1232 of this title and section 553 of Title 5, the \nSecretary shall by notice in the Federal Register, publish the waivers or \nmodifications  of  statutory  and  regulatory  provisions  the  Secretary \ndeems  necessary  to  achieve  the  purposes  of  this  section.” \n§ 1098bb(b)(1).15 \nPlaintiffs, however, argue that § 1098bb(b)(1) “applies only when the \nwaiver or modifications are ‘authorized’ under Section 1098bb(a)” and \nthat the Program is not “authorized” by § 1098bb(a). ECF No. 26 at 7. \nWhether  the  HEROES  Act  authorizes  the  Program  pertains  to  the \nAPA’s  substantive  requirements.  But  as  a  procedural  matter,  the \nSecretary  may  waive  or  modify  any  provision  without  notice  and \ncomment under the HEROES Act. All the APA requires is that the \nSecretary publish the modifications of title IV of the HEA, which the \nSecretary has done here. \nThus, because the Program was issued under the HEROES Act, \nwhich exempts notice and comment, the Program did not violate the \nAPA’s procedural requirements. Whether the HEROES Act authorized \nthe Program is a different story. \n2.  APA’s Substantive Requirements \nPlaintiffs  contend  that  the  Secretary  lacks  the  authority  to \nimplement the Program under the HEROES Act. ECF Nos. 4 at 16; 34 \nat  4.  When  reviewing  an  agency’s  interpretation  of  its  statutory \nauthority, courts have generally applied the framework established in \nChevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. \n \n15 Whether  §  1098bb(b)(1)  exempts  notice  and  comment  turns  on  the  word \n“notwithstanding.”  But a dictionary definition of “notwithstanding” does not answer \nthat question as “[d]rafters often use nothwithstanding in a catchall provision, where \nits supposed referent is unclear.” See A. SCALIA & B. GARNER, READING LAW: THE \nINTERPRETATION OF LEGAL TEXTS 126 (2012) (emphasis in original). “A dependent \nphrase that begins with notwithstanding indicates that the main clause that it \nintroduces or follows derogates from the provision to which it refers.” Id.  Thus, \n“notwithstanding is a fail-safe way of ensuring that the clause it introduces will \nabsolutely, positively prevail.” Id. at 127. Here, “notwithstanding” in § 1098bb(b)(1) \nmeans without obstruction from the notice and comment requirements. Plaintiffs do \nnot dispute this meaning.  \n18 \n \n\nCase 4:22-cv-00908-P   Document 37   Filed 11/10/22    Page 19 of 26   PageID 557\n837, 843–44 (1984). Under Chevron, if a statute is ambiguous about the \nissue, courts defer to the agency’s interpretation of the statute if it is \n“reasonable.”  Entergy  Corp.  v.  Riverkeeper,  Inc.,  556  U.S.  208,  218 \n(2009)). In recent years, however, the Supreme Court has chipped away \nat Chevron—giving back “the benefit of doubt about the meaning of an \nambiguous law to the individual” instead of the government. Buffington \nv. McDonough, No. 21-972, 2022 WL 16726027, at *5 (U.S. Nov. 7, 2022) \n(cleaned up). \nThe most recent example of Chevron’s fall is the crystallization of the \nlong-developing major-questions doctrine in West Virginia. v. EPA, 142 \nS. Ct. 2587 (2022).16 The doctrine provides that when an agency seeks \nto resolve a major question, a “merely plausible textual basis for the \nagency action” is not enough. Id. at 2609. “The agency instead must \npoint to ‘clear congressional authorization’ for the power it claims. Id. \n(quoting Utility Air Reg. Grp. v. EPA, 573 U.S. 302, 324 (2014)). \nPlaintiffs contend that the Program fails under the major-questions \ndoctrine. The Court thus addresses whether the doctrine applies. And if \nso,  whether  there  is  “clear  congressional  authorization”  for  the \nProgram.17 \na.  The Major-Questions Doctrine Applies \nThe major-questions doctrine applies if an agency claims the power \nto make decisions of vast “economic and political significance.” Id. at \n2607–14.  It  is  unclear  what  exactly  constitutes  “vast  economic \nsignificance.” But courts have generally considered an agency action to \nbe of vast economic significance if it requires “billions of dollars in \nspending.” King v. Burwell, 576 U.S. 473, 485 (2015). For example, the \nSupreme Court in Alabama Association of Realtors v. Department of \n \n16 The major-questions doctrine’s precise relationship to the Chevron framework is \nunclear, as the Court did not mention Chevron in that case. Defendants stated at the \npreliminary-injunction hearing that Chevron does not apply if the major-questions \ndoctrine applies. See ECF No. 32. Nor does either party mention Chevron in their \nbriefs. For those reasons, the Court reasons that Chevron is not applicable here. But \neven if it were applicable, the major questions doctrine compels the same result—the \nSecretary  lacks  “clear  congressional  authorization”  to  implement  the  Program—\nregardless of how the major-questions doctrine fits into the Chevron framework. \n \n19 \n \n\nCase 4:22-cv-00908-P   Document 37   Filed 11/10/22    Page 20 of 26   PageID 558\nHealth & Human Services reasoned that an economic impact of $50 \nbillion was of vast economic significance. 141 S. Ct. 2485, 2489 (2021). \nSimilarly, the Fifth Circuit in BST Holdings, L.L.C v. OSHA held that \n$3 billion in compliance costs was enough to trigger the major-questions \ndoctrine. 17 F. 4th 604, 617 (5th Cir. 2021). Because the Program will \ncost more than $400 billion—over 100 times more than the amount in \nBST  Holdings  and  20  times  more  than  the  amount  in  Alabama \nAssociation of Realtors—it has vast economic significance. \nAn  agency  action  is  politically  significant  if  Congress  has  been \n“engaged in robust debates” over bills authorizing something like the \nagency’s action. West Virginia., 142 S. Ct. at 2620–21 (Gorsuch, J., \nconcurring). And if Congress “considered and rejected” such bills, “that \ntoo may be a sign that an agency is attempting to work around the \nlegislative  process  to  resolve  for  itself  a  question  of  great  political \nsignificance.” Id. (cleaned up). For example, in NFIB v. OSHA, the \nSupreme Court held that the major-questions doctrine applied when \nvarious vaccine mandate bills considered by Congress had failed, and an \nagency sought to mandate COVID-19 vaccines for millions of Americans. \n142 S. Ct. 661, 662–66 (2022).  \nSimilarly, Congress has introduced multiple bills to provide student \nloan relief to those who make under a certain amount. See S. 2235, 116th \nCong. (2019); H.R. 2034, 117th Cong. (2021). And all have failed. A bill \nwas also introduced—to respond to the economic impact of COVID-19—\nthat provided the Secretary the authority to “cancel or repay” federal \nstudent loans up to “$10,000 [of] the outstanding balance” for certain \nborrowers. See H.R. 6800, 116th Cong. § 150117(h). But this bill also \nfailed. Thus, considering Congress’s extensive consideration of various \nbills attempting to forgive student loans and failure to pass such bills, \nthe Program is of vast political significance. \nOddly enough, Defendants do “not deny that this is a case of economic \nand political significance.” ECF No. 24 at 22. Instead, they argue that \nthe doctrine does not apply because “this case involves the disbursement \nof a federal benefit to individuals, not the kind of expansive regulation \nof private parties that have previously triggered the doctrine.” Id. at \n20 \n \n\nCase 4:22-cv-00908-P   Document 37   Filed 11/10/22    Page 21 of 26   PageID 559\n23.18 But this statement is untrue. See Kentucky v. Biden, 23 F.4th 585, \n606–08 (6th Cir. 2022) (applying the major-questions doctrine to vaccine \nmandate for federal employees); Georgia v. President of the U.S., 46 \nF.4th 1283, 1295–96 (11th Cir. 2022) (same). And even if this were true, \nthe Court would not presume that the doctrine does not apply to an \nagency decision of vast economic and political significance because it \ninvolves the disbursement of a federal benefit. Instead, the Court must \n“presume that ‘Congress intends to make major policy decisions itself, \nnot leave those decisions to agencies.’” West Virginia, 142 S. Ct. at 2609 \n(quoting U.S. Telecom Ass’n v. FCC, 855 F.3d 381, 419 (D.C. Cir. 2017)). \nThus, because the Program is an agency action of vast economic and \npolitical significance, the major-questions doctrine applies.  \nb.  The Secretary Lacks “Clear Congressional Authorization” to \nImplement the Program \nBecause  the  major-questions  doctrine  applies,  the  Government’s \nassertion of authority is treated with “skepticism.” West Virginia, 142 S. \nCt. at 2614. “To overcome that skepticism, the Government must . . . \npoint to clear congressional authorization” permitting its action. Id. \n(cleaned up). To do so, Defendants point to the HEROES Act. But the \ntext of the Act points the other way for at least three reasons. See \nAldridge v. Williams, 44 U.S. (3 How.) 9, 24 (1845) (“The law as it passed \nis the will of the majority of both houses, and the only mode in which \nthat will is spoken is in the act itself; and we must gather their intention \nfrom the language there used.”). \nFirst,  the  HEROES  Act  does  not  mention  loan  forgiveness.  If \nCongress provided clear congressional authorization for $400 billion in \nstudent loan forgiveness via the HEROES Act, it would have mentioned \nloan forgiveness. The Act allows the Secretary only to “waive or modify” \nprovisions of title IV. The Secretary then uses that provision to rewrite \n \n18 The Court finds it telling that Defendants—rather than addressing Plaintiffs’ \narguments that the major-questions doctrine applies—copied and pasted their entire \nmajor-questions  doctrine  section  from  another  lawsuit  challenging  the  Program. \nCompare ECF No. 24 at 22–26, with Nebraska v. Biden, No. 4:22-CV-1040-HEA, ECF \nNo. 27 at 29–35. \n \n21 \n \n\nCase 4:22-cv-00908-P   Document 37   Filed 11/10/22    Page 22 of 26   PageID 560\ntitle  IV  portions  to  provide  for  loan  forgiveness.19  But  “enabling \nlegislation” like the HEROES Act is not an “open book to which the \nagency may add pages and change the plot line.” West Virginia, 142 S. \nCt. at 2609 (2022); U.S. Fleet Servs. Inc. v. City of Fort Worth, 141 F. \nSupp. 2d 631, 644 (N.D. Tex. 2001) (Mahon, J.) (refusing to engage in an \nexercise of “legal jingoism” requiring the court to insert words into a law \nor rule to arrive at a particular party’s interpretation). Agencies may \n“not seek to hide elephants in mouseholes.” West Virginia, 142 S. at 2622 \n(Gorsuch, J., concurring) (quoting Whitman v. Am. Trucking Ass’ns, Inc., \n531 U.S. 457, 468 (2001)).  \nSecond, the portions of the HEROES Act Defendants rely on fail to \nprovide clear congressional authorization for the Program. Defendants \nrely on the COVID-19 pandemic as their justification for the Program. \nThey contend that the HEROES Act allows the Secretary the authority \nto address the financial hardship of the COVID-19 pandemic. Indeed, \nthe COVID-19 pandemic falls within the HEROES Act’s definition of an \nemergency.  § 1098ee(4).  But  it  is  unclear  whether  the  Program  is \n“necessary  in  connection  with  [that]  national  emergency.” \n§ 1098bb(a)(1).  The  COVID-19  pandemic  was  declared  a  national \nemergency  almost  three  years  ago  and  declared  weeks  before  the \nProgram by the President as “over.”20 Thus, it is unclear if COVID-19 is \nstill a “national emergency” under the Act.  \nDefendants  contend  that  in  ten  years,  they  could  still  use  the \nHEROES Act to forgive student loan debt because of the COVID-19 \npandemic if the Secretary deems it “necessary.” ECF No. 32, at 69–70. \nBut a legislative provision with “broad or general language” will not \n \n19 As the Texas Supreme Court recognized 130 years ago: \n \nWhen the purpose of a legislative enactment is obvious from the language \nof the law itself, there is nothing left to construction. In such case it is vain \nto ask the courts to attempt to liberate an invisible spirit, supposed to live \nconcealed within the body of the law, and thus interpret away the manifest \nlegislative intention by embracing subjects not fairly within the scope of \nthe statute. \n \nDodson v. Bunton, 17 S.W. 507, 508 (Tex. 1891).  \n \n20 60  Minutes  (@60Minutes),  TWITTER  (Sept.  18,  2022,  7:09  PM), \nhttps://tinyurl.com/2s35maau. \n22 \n \n\nCase 4:22-cv-00908-P   Document 37   Filed 11/10/22    Page 23 of 26   PageID 561\nsupply a clear statement. Id. at 2623. The Department’s reliance on its \nability to modify provisions of title IV “as the Secretary deems necessary \nin connection with a . . . national emergency” is the very language that \ndoes not supply a clear statement. See, e.g., Ala. Ass’n of Realtors, 141 \nS. Ct. at 2489 (“It is hard to see what measures [the Government’s] \ninterpretation  would  place  outside  the  CDC’s  reach,  and  the \nGovernment has identified no limit in [42 U.S.C.] § 361(a) beyond the \nrequirement  that  the  CDC  deem  a  measure  ‘necessary.”)  (emphasis \nadded). \nThird, “the agency’s past interpretations of the relevant statute” is \nanother clue that the Secretary lacks clear congressional authorization \nfor  the  Program.  West  Virginia.,  142  S.  Ct.  at  2625  (Gorsuch,  J., \nconcurring).  “When  an  agency  claims  to  have  found  a  previously \n‘unheralded power’ in a rarely invoked statutory provision, its assertion \ngenerally warrants “a measure of skepticism.” Id. (quoting Utility Air, \n573 U. S., at 324). The Department has not “relied on the HEROES Act \nor any other statutory, regulatory, or interpretative authority for the \nblanket or mass cancellation. . . of student loan principal balances, \nand/or  the  material  change  of  repayment  amounts  or  terms.”  See \nMemorandum to Betsy DeVos Secretary of Education at 6. \nThus,  because  the  Department  lacks  “clear  congressional \nauthorization”  for  the  Program  under  the  HEROES  Act,  the  Court \ngrants summary judgment in favor of Plaintiffs.  \nc.  Vacatur is the Appropriate Remedy \nNext, the appropriate remedy. Plaintiffs seek two types of relief—\nvacatur of the Program and nationwide injunctive relief. “Vacatur [of an \nagency action] retroactively undoes or expunges a past [agency] action \n. . . . Unlike an injunction, which merely blocks enforcement, vacatur \nunwinds the challenged agency action.” Data Mktg. P’ship, 45 F.4th at \n859 (quoting Driftless Area Land Conservancy v. Valcq, 16 F.4th 508, \n522 (7th Cir. 2021)) (alterations and ellipsis in original). While “[i]t is \nnot beyond the power of a court, in appropriate circumstances, to issue \na nationwide injunction,” these circumstances do not justify such a \nremedy. Texas v. United States, 809 F.3d 134, 188 (5th Cir. 2015).  \n23 \n \n\nCase 4:22-cv-00908-P   Document 37   Filed 11/10/22    Page 24 of 26   PageID 562\nInstead, “the ordinary practice is to vacate unlawful agency action.” \nData Mktg. P’ship, 45 F.4th at 859 (quoting United Steel v. Mine Safety \n& Health Admin., 925 F.3d 1279, 1287 (D.C. Cir. 2019)). Vacatur is \nauthorized by 5 U.S.C. § 706, which requires the Court to decide “all \nrelevant questions of law [and] interpret constitutional and statutory \nprovisions” and “hold unlawful and set aside” agency action “not in \naccordance with law,” “in excess of statutory jurisdiction,” or “short of \nstatutory right.” Because “under our Constitution, the people’s elected \nrepresentatives in Congress are the  decisionmakers here—and they \nhave not clearly granted the agency the authority it claims for itself,” \nthe  Program  is  unlawful.  West  Virginia,  142  S.  Ct.  at  2626  (2022) \n(Gorsuch, J., concurring). The Court thus applies the “default rule” and \nvacates the Program. See Data Mktg. P’ship, 45 F.4th at 859–60. \nSometimes  courts—though  authorized  by  the  APA  to  vacate  an \nagency  action—exercise  their  discretion  to  remand  the  action  for \nadjustments or another agency review. See, e.g., Texas v. United States, \n50 F.4th at 529. In deciding whether to sidestep complete vacatur, courts \nconsider “(1) the seriousness of the deficiencies of the action, that is, how \nlikely the agency will be able to justify its decision on remand; and \n(2) the disruptive consequences of the vacatur.” Id. If there is a small \ndefect or deficiency that is quickly curable or an existing complex agency \nprogram that requires major winddown efforts, a court may remand \nwithout vacating the entire action. See, e.g., Lion Health Servs., Inc. v. \nSebelius, 635 F.3d 693, 703 (5th Cir. 2011) (remanding to the agency to \nrecalculate amounts owed in a manner consistent with the statute).  \nBoth factors weigh against remand. First, the agency’s misstep is not \ncorrectible on remand—it is a complete usurpation of congressional \nauthorization  implicating  the  separation  of  powers  required  by  the \nConstitution.  Second,  the  Program  does  not  require  a  significant \nadministrative winddown period, as loan forgiveness has not started. \nThus, remand is not the appropriate remedy. \nFor those reasons, vacatur of the Program is the appropriate remedy.  \n \n \n24 \n \n\nCase 4:22-cv-00908-P   Document 37   Filed 11/10/22    Page 25 of 26   PageID 563\nCONCLUSION \nThis case involves the question of whether Congress—through the \nHEROES Act—gave the Secretary authority to implement a Program \nthat provides debt forgiveness to millions of student-loan borrowers, \ntotaling over $400 billion. Whether the Program constitutes good public \npolicy is not the role of this Court to determine.21 Still, no one can \nplausibly  deny  that  it  is  either  one  of  the  largest  delegations  of \nlegislative power to the executive branch, or one of the largest exercises \nof legislative power without congressional authority in the history of the \nUnited States.  \nIn this country, we are not ruled by an all-powerful executive with a \npen and a phone. Instead, we are ruled by a Constitution that provides \nfor  three  distinct  and  independent  branches  of  government.  As \nPresident James Madison warned, “[t]he accumulation of all powers, \nlegislative, executive, and judiciary, in the same hands, whether of one, \na few, or many, and whether hereditary, self-appointed, or elective, may \njustly be pronounced the very definition of tyranny.” THE FEDERALIST \nNO. 47.  \nThe Court is not blind to the current political division in our country. \nBut it is fundamental to the survival of our Republic that the separation \nof powers as outlined in our Constitution be preserved. And having \ninterpreted the HEROES Act, the Court holds that it does not provide \n“clear congressional authorization” for the Program proposed by the \nSecretary.  \nThus,  Plaintiffs’  Motion  for  Summary  Judgment  (ECF  No.  3)  is \nGRANTED  and  Defendants’  Motion  to  Dismiss  (ECF  No.  25)  is \n \n21 Under our system of government, public policy is typically made by the Congress \nthrough a negotiated-and-reasoned process among the members, with input from the \nPresident, and based on how Congress legislated, those members would then be held \naccountable by their constituents each election cycle. See Speaker Sam Rayburn, \nquoted in D.B. Hardeman & Donald C. Bacon, RAYBURN: A BIOGRAPHY 429 (1987) (“A \n[politician] who is not willing to get out and defend what he has done will ultimately \nfind himself in poor shape politically.”).

The Administrative Procedure Act’s notice-and-comment procedures exist for good \nreason: “to ensure that unelected administrators, who are not directly accountable to the populace, are \nforced to justify their quasi-legislative rulemaking before an informed and skeptical public.” New Jersey \nv. HHS, 670 F.2d 1262, 1281 (3d Cir. 1981). \n2.  By requiring notice and comment, the APA “ensure[s] that affected parties have an \nopportunity to participate in and influence agency decision making at an early stage, when the agency \nis more likely to give real consideration to alternative ideas.” U.S. Steel Corp. v. EPA, 595 F.2d 207, 214 \n(5th Cir. 1979). \n3.  Simply  put,  the  APA’s  notice-and-comment  requirements  promote  “openness, \nexplanation, and participatory democracy” and are a critical check on “the dangers of arbitrariness and \n\nCase 4:22-cv-00908-O   Document 1   Filed 10/10/22    Page 2 of 15   PageID 2\n \nirrationality in the formulation of rules.” Weyerhaeuser Co. v . Costle, 590 F.2d 1011, 1027-28 (D.C. Cir. \n1978).   \n4.  The Department of Education has flagrantly violated the APA’s notice-and-comment \nrequirements. Behind closed doors, the Department promulgated a new Debt Forgiveness Program \nthat will affect tens of millions of Americans and cost more than 400 billion dollars.  \n5.  Instead of providing notice and seeking comment from the public, the Department \nhammered out the critical details of the Program in secret and with an eye toward securing debt \nforgiveness in time for the November election.  \n6.  Along  the  way,  the  Department  made  numerous  arbitrary  decisions  about  the \nProgram, including which individuals will receive debt forgiveness, how much of their debt will be \nforgiven, and which types of debt will qualify for the Program.  \n7.  The result of this arbitrariness is predictable: some will benefit handsomely, some will \nbe shortchanged, and others will be left out entirely. \n8.  Plaintiffs are just a few of the millions of Americans who are being harmed by the \nDepartment’s arbitrary decisionmaking. Plaintiff Myra Brown does not qualify for debt forgiveness \nbecause the Debt Forgiveness Program does not cover commercially held loans that are not in default, \nand Plaintiff Alexander Taylor does not qualify for the full amount of debt forgiveness because he did \nnot receive a Pell Grant when he was in college.   \n9.  By adopting the Program without providing notice and comment, the Department \ndeprived Plaintiffs of their “‘procedural right to protect [their] concrete interests.’” Texas v. EEOC, \n933 F.3d 433, 447 (5th Cir. 2019) (cleaned up); see id. (“A violation of the APA’s notice-and-comment \nrequirements is one example of a deprivation of a procedural right.”). \n10.  If the Department is going to pursue debt forgiveness, Plaintiffs believe that their \nstudent loan debt should be forgiven too. Ms. Brown believes it is irrational, arbitrary, and unfair to \n  - 2 - \n\nCase 4:22-cv-00908-O   Document 1   Filed 10/10/22    Page 3 of 15   PageID 3\n \nexclude her from the Program because her federal student loans are commercially held and not in \ndefault. Mr. Taylor believes that it is irrational, arbitrary, and unfair to calculate the amount of debt \nforgiveness he receives based on the financial circumstances of his parents many years ago. Plaintiffs \nwant an opportunity to present their views to the Department and to provide additional comments \non any proposal from the Department to forgive student loan debts. \n11.  Without relief from this Court, Plaintiffs will be forever denied their procedural rights \nto protect their concrete interests.  \n12.  Because the Debt Forgiveness Program was adopted in violation of the APA, the \nProgram must be vacated and set aside and the Department should be enjoined from implementing \nor enforcing the Program in any manner.  \nPARTIES \n13.  Plaintiff Myra Brown received her undergraduate degree from the University of Texas \nat El-Paso in 1993. Ms. Brown then attended graduate school at the Cox School of Business at \nSouthern Methodist University in Dallas, Texas. Ms. Brown completed her graduate school studies in \n2002. To pay for graduate school, Ms. Brown received student loans through the Federal Family \nEducation Loan Program (“FFELP”).  \n14.  Ms. Brown currently has two FFELP loans totaling more than $17,000. Because Ms. \nBrown’s loans are commercially held and not in default, she is ineligible for debt forgiveness under \nthe Debt Forgiveness Program.  \n15.  Plaintiff Alexander Taylor received his undergraduate degree from the University of \nDallas. To pay for his undergraduate studies, Mr. Taylor received federal student loans through the \nDirect Loan Program.  \n16.  Mr. Taylor currently has four loans totaling more than $35,000. Mr. Taylor’s loans are \nheld by the Department of Education and he made less than $125,000 in 2020 and 2021. Because Mr. \n  - 3 - \n\nCase 4:22-cv-00908-O   Document 1   Filed 10/10/22    Page 4 of 15   PageID 4\n \nTaylor never received a Pell Grant, he is ineligible for the full $20,000 in debt forgiveness under the \nDebt Forgiveness Program.  \n17.  Defendant  U.S.  Department  of  Education  is  an  agency  of  the  United  States \ngovernment subject to the APA. See 5 U.S.C. §551(1). \n18.  Defendant Miguel Cardona is the U.S. Secretary of Education. The Secretary is sued \nin his official capacity as the head of the Department of Education. \nJURISDICTION & VENUE \n19.  This Court has subject-matter jurisdiction over this case because it arises under the \nlaws of the United States. See 5 U.S.C. §§701, et seq.; 28 U.S.C. §§1331, 2201-2202. \n20.  Venue is proper in this Court under 28 U.S.C. §1391(e) because this is an action against \nan officer and an agency of the United States, a plaintiff resides in this judicial district, and no real \nproperty is involved in the action. Venue is proper in the Fort Worth Division of this Court because \nPlaintiff Myra Brown resides in this division.  \nBACKGROUND \nI.  The Department of Education’s Grant and Loan Programs \n21.  The Department of Education offers two primary types of financial aid to help \nstudents pay for their higher education: grants and loans. See Types of Aid, U.S. Dep’t of Educ., \nhttps://bit.ly/3S51Heu. \n22.  Federal grants are “[f]inancial aid that generally [don’t] have to be repaid.” Id.  \n23.  For example, the Department provides Pell Grants to undergraduate students if their \nparents’ income is below a certain threshold when they applied for the grant. Federal Pell Grant Program, \nU.S. Dep’t of Educ., https://bit.ly/3DKV6BG; 20 U.S.C. §1070a, et seq. The maximum Pell Grant \naward  for  the  2022-2023  year  is  $6,895.  Federal  Pell  Grants,  U.S.  Dep’t  of  Educ., \nhttps://bit.ly/3BCraVq. \n  - 4 - \n\nCase 4:22-cv-00908-O   Document 1   Filed 10/10/22    Page 5 of 15   PageID 5\n \n24.  Federal loans, by contrast, are “[b]orrowed money for college or career school [that] \nmust be repaid with interest.” Types of Aid, supra. \n25.  The Department currently administers three student loan programs. \n26.  Under the William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Program, the federal government \nmakes loans directly to borrowers, who are then responsible for repaying the government. See \n20 U.S.C. §1087a, et seq. Direct Loans account for about $1.4 trillion of outstanding student debt. See \nFederal Student Loan Portfolio, U.S. Dep’t of Educ., https://bit.ly/3qYd5Nm. \n27.  Under the Federal Family Education Loan Program, the federal government paid \nlenders to make student loans, and the federal government guaranteed their repayment. 20 U.S.C. \n§1071, et seq. The authority to issue loans under this program expired in 2010. 20 U.S.C. §1071(d). \nFFELP loans currently account for about $213.7 billion of outstanding student debt nationwide. See \nFederal Student Loan Portfolio, supra.  \n28.  Under the Perkins Loan Program, colleges and universities made loans to financially \nneedy students, and the federal government guaranteed their repayment. 20 U.S.C. §1087aa, et seq. The \nauthority to issue loans under the Perkins program expired in 2017. 20 U.S.C. §1087aa(b). Perkins \nLoans currently account for about $4 billion of outstanding student debt. See Federal Student Loan \nPortfolio, supra.  \n29.  About 43 million individuals have debts arising under these three programs. See Federal \nStudent Loan Portfolio, supra. These individuals collectively have more than $1.61 trillion in outstanding \ndebts. Id. \nII.  The Department’s Limited Authority to Compromise Student Loan Debt \n30.  Because federal agencies are a “creature of statute,” the Department of Education has \n“only those authorities conferred upon it by Congress.” Atl. City Elec. Co. v. FERC, 295 F.3d 1, 8 (D.C. \n  - 5 - \n\nCase 4:22-cv-00908-O   Document 1   Filed 10/10/22    Page 6 of 15   PageID 6\n \nCir. 2002) (cleaned up). The Department thus cannot forgive student loan debt unless Congress has \nauthorized it to do so. \n31.  The primary statute governing when agencies may forgive debts is the Federal Claims \nCollection Act of 1966, which provides that agencies “shall try to collect a claim of the United States \nGovernment for money or property arising out of the activities of, or referred to, the agency.” \n31 U.S.C. §3711(a)(1).  \n32.  The Federal Claims Collection Standards (“FCCS”), which implement the Federal \nClaims Collection Act, require that “[f]ederal agencies shall aggressively collect all debts arising out of \nactivities of . . . that agency.” 31 C.F.R. §901.1.  \n33.  Under the FCCS, agencies are permitted to “compromise a debt” only in four \ncircumstances: (1) where “the debtor is unable to pay the full amount in a reasonable time, as verified \nthrough credit reports or other financial information”; (2) the agency is “unable to collect the debt in \nfull within a reasonable time by enforced collection proceedings”; (3) “the cost of collecting the debt \ndoes not justify the enforced collection of the full amount”; or (4) “[t]here is significant doubt \nconcerning the Government’s ability to prove its case in court.” 31 C.F.R. §902.2(a); see also id. \n§902.2(b)  (requiring  agencies  to  consider  individualized  factors,  including  “[a]ge  and  health,” \n“[p]resent and potential income,” and “[i]nheritance prospects,” when determining a debtor’s inability \nto pay).  \n34.  The Department of Education’s regulations expressly incorporate the FCCS. Under \nthe Department’s regulations, the Department “uses the standards in the FCCS, 31 CFR part 902, to \ndetermine  whether  compromise  of  a  debt  is  appropriate  if  the  debt  arises  under  a  program \nadministered by the Department.” 34 C.F.R. §30.70(a)(1); see also id. §30.70(e)(1) (“[U]nder the \nprovisions of 31 CFR part 902 or 903, the Secretary may compromise a debt in any amount, or suspend \nor terminate collection of a debt in any amount, if the debt arises under the Federal Family Education \n  - 6 - \n\nCase 4:22-cv-00908-O   Document 1   Filed 10/10/22    Page 7 of 15   PageID 7\n \nLoan Program . . . , the William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan program . . . , or the Perkins Loan \nProgram.”); see also 81 Fed. Reg. 75,926, 76,070 (Nov. 1, 2016) (adopting these regulations after notice \nand comment). \n35.  “It is a fundamental principle of administrative law that an agency is bound to adhere \nto its own regulations.” Fuller v. Winter, 538 F. Supp. 2d 179, 186 (D.D.C. 2008); see Richardson v. Joslin, \n501 F.3d 415, 418 (5th Cir. 2007) (an agency “must abide by its own regulations”).  \nIII.  The Debt Forgiveness Program \n36.  In the summer of 2022, reports emerged that the White House was considering \nexecutive action to forgive student loan debt for tens of millions of individuals. See T. Pager, Latest \nWhite House Plan Would Forgive $10,000 in Student Debt Per Borrower, Wash. Post (May 27, 2022), \nhttps://wapo.st/39lXnpW.  \n37.  Behind closed doors, White House officials were debating the various issues that \nwould arise from such a program. Id. None of these discussions were open to the public.  \n38.  According to reports, White House officials “dr[ew] up a range of proposals” and were \n“waiting on the president to make a final decision.” See A. Restuccia, Biden Decision on Student-Loan \nForgiveness  Unlikely  Until  Later  in  Summer,  Officials  Say,  Wall  St.  J.  (June  6,  2022), \nhttps://on.wsj.com/3qZN53V. \n39.  A primary point of debate was the size of the debt forgiveness to each individual. \nAlthough Senator Elizabeth Warren and others were pushing for forgiving up to $50,000 in student \ndebt per borrower, the President was “more comfortable with debt cancellation in the $10,000-per-\nborrower range.” A. Restuccia, As Biden Zeroes In on Student-Loan Forgiveness Decision, Voter Anxiety \nGrows, WSJ (May 23, 2022), https://on.wsj.com/3S46zAl. As of late May, White House officials were \n“planning to cancel $10,000 in student debt per borrower.” Pager, supra.  \n  - 7 - \n\nCase 4:22-cv-00908-O   Document 1   Filed 10/10/22    Page 8 of 15   PageID 8\n \n40.  The White House also was debating whether high-income individuals should be \nexcluded from the debt forgiveness program. As of late May, the plan was to limit debt forgiveness to \nAmericans “who earned less than $150,000 in the previous year, or less than $300,000 for married \ncouples filing jointly.” Id. These income limits were “aimed at fending off criticism that across-the-\nboard loan forgiveness would benefit some Americans with higher incomes who don’t need the help.” \nM. Stratford, Harder Than It Sounds: Income-Targeted Student Loan Forgiveness Invites a ‘Train Wreck,’ Politico \n(May 13, 2022), https://politi.co/3LEtXC1. These “income caps [were] in flux,” however, because \n“some Democratic lawmakers [were] implor[ing] the White House to abandon means-testing.” \nD. Douglas-Gabriel, Student Loan Borrowers Anxious as Decision Lingers on Debt Cancellation, Wash. Post \n(June 10, 2022), https://wapo.st/3NUdlXg. White House officials were also debating alternatives to \nincome thresholds, such as limiting debt forgiveness to “undergraduates or people who attend public \nuniversities.” Restuccia, Biden Decision on Student-Loan Forgiveness, supra.  \n41.  Another factor “complicating the decision” was the best way “to implement [this] large \nnew government program.” Id. Department officials “privately raised concerns about the complexity \nof adding an income test to student loan forgiveness” and “warn[ed] the White House that the agency \nlacks the data to automatically cancel loans based on a borrower’s earnings.” Stratford, supra. The \nDepartment thus believed that it would likely “need to set up some sort of application process to \ndetermine whether borrowers qualify for relief.” Id.   \n42.  White House officials were also concerned “about the possible effects the move could \nhave on record inflation” and were “cautious about doing anything that could be perceived as \ncontributing to high prices.” Restuccia, Biden Decision on Student-Loan Forgiveness, supra. While some in \nthe Administration dismissed these concerns, others warned that “student debt cancellation would \nexacerbate price pressures.” Id. Debt cancellation would also “encourage colleges and universities to \n  - 8 - \n\nCase 4:22-cv-00908-O   Document 1   Filed 10/10/22    Page 9 of 15   PageID 9\n \ncontinue to raise tuition prices with the expectation that the costs would ultimately not be borne by \ntheir students.” Id. \n43.  Whether the President had the legal authority for such a program was also being \ndebated. The Justice Department and the Department of Education were “weighing whether Mr. \nBiden has the legal authority to unilaterally wipe away loans through executive action.” Restuccia, As \nBiden Zeroes In, supra. The Department of Education under President Trump had determined that it \nlacked such authority, see Memo. to Betsy DeVos Re: Student Loan Principal Balance Cancellation, Compromise, \nDischarge, and Forgiveness Authority, U.S. Dep’t of Educ. Off. of the Gen. Counsel, (Jan. 12, 2021), \nhttps://bit.ly/3LBA36n, and key Democrats agreed, including Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, \nsee A. Nova, Pelosi Says Biden Doesn’t Have Power to Cancel Student Debt, CNBC (July 28. 2021), \nhttps://cnb.cx/3S85wzp; see also G. Rubin, Mass Student Debt Cancellation Legally Risky Says Top Obama \nEducation Lawyer, Wall St. J. (May 4, 2022), https://on.wsj.com/3DO0tjx. President Biden nevertheless \ninstructed the Department to prepare a memorandum exploring possible legal avenues to justify the \nProgram. See L. Egan, Biden to Review Executive Authority to Cancel Student Debt, NBC News (Apr. 1, \n2021), https://nbcnews.to/3dD85dV.  \n44.  Finally, the White House was “weighing the political boost that could come from \nforgiving loans among young people and others against the backlash from voters who didn’t go to \ncollege, don’t have loans, or already paid them off.” Restuccia, Biden Decision on Student-Loan Forgiveness, \nsupra. An overriding goal was to get the program done fast—so that debt forgiveness would occur in \ntime for the November election. Restuccia, As Biden Zeroes In, supra. \n45.  White House officials indicated that the President would announce his decision in July \nor August of 2022. Restuccia, Biden Decision on Student-Loan Forgiveness, supra.  \n  - 9 - \n\nCase 4:22-cv-00908-O   Document 1   Filed 10/10/22    Page 10 of 15   PageID 10\n \n46.  At no point did the Department of Education provide notice of its plans or seek public \ncomment on the program. Instead, the countless legal, policy, economic, and other issues implicated \nby such a program were all debated and determined in secret.  \n47.  On August 24, the White House announced that the President would “fulfill[] [his] \ncampaign commitment” by providing debt forgiveness to millions of borrowers. See Fact Sheet: President \nBiden Announces Student Loan Relief for Borrowers Who Need It Most, The White House (Aug. 24, 2022), \nhttps://bit.ly/3dATj7p. \n48.  Under the Program, individuals would receive different levels of debt forgiveness \nbased on whether they had received a Pell Grant in college. Those who received a Pell Grant could \nget up to $20,000 in debt forgiveness while those who did not could get only $10,000 in debt \nforgiveness. One-Time Student Loan Debt Relief, U.S. Dep’t of Educ., https://bit.ly/3ygbuGz (website \nas of Sept. 8, 2022). \n49.  The Department also announced that those individuals who exceeded an income \nthreshold would be ineligible for the program. Under the Program, individuals with student loans \nwould be ineligible if they earned more than $125,000 (or $250,000 if married filing jointly) in 2020 \nand 2021. Id. \n50.  The Department further stated that “most federal student loans” would qualify for \ndebt forgiveness, including Direct Loans, FFELP loans held by the Department or in default, and \nPerkins Loans held by the Department. Id. But individuals with FFELP loans that are commercially \nheld would “not [be] eligible for debt relief.” Id. The Department asserted that it was currently \n“assessing whether to expand eligibility to borrowers with privately owned federal student loans, \nincluding FFEL and Perkins Loans.” Id.  \n51.  The Department also released a five-page legal memorandum asserting that the Higher \nEducation Relief Opportunities for Students (“HEROES”) Act of 2003 gave it the legal authority to \n  - 10 - \n\nCase 4:22-cv-00908-O   Document 1   Filed 10/10/22    Page 11 of 15   PageID 11\n \nenact the Debt Forgiveness Program. See The Secretary’s Legal Authority for Debt Cancellation, U.S. Dept \nof Educ. (Aug. 23, 2022), https://bit.ly/3fcXeYJ.  \n52.  The HEROES Act was enacted following the September 11 attacks and again shortly \nafter the start of the Iraq War, and was designed primarily to ensure that the “[h]undreds of thousands \nof Army, Air Force, Marine Corps, Navy, and Coast Guard reservists and members of the National \nGuard [who] ha[d] been called to active duty or active service” would not be “placed in a worse \nposition financially in relation to that financial assistance” because of their military service. See \n20 U.S.C. §§1098aa(b)(4), 1098bb(a)(2)(A). \n53.  The Department’s legal justification for the Program was widely criticized following \nthe White House’s announcement, even by those supporting debt cancelation. See, e.g., Jed Shugerman, \nBiden’s Student-Debt Rescue Plan Is a Legal Mess, The Atlantic (Sept. 4, 2022), https://bit.ly/3qVEK18.  \n54.  On September 27, the Secretary of Education sent a memorandum to the Assistant \nSecretary for Postsecondary Education in which he officially “issu[ed] waivers and modifications” to \ncertain statutes and regulations in order to effectuate the Debt Forgiveness Program. Citing the \nHEROES Act, the Secretary directed the Department to “take all necessary actions to implement \nthese waivers and modifications and to provide notice of these waivers and modifications in the \nFederal Register.”  \n55.  The memorandum contained no estimate of the Program’s cost. But the nonpartisan \nCongressional Budget Office has estimated that the Program will cost over $400 billion. Costs of \nSuspending  Student  Loan  Payments  and  Canceling  Debt,  Cong.  Budget  Off.  (Sept.  26,  2022), \nhttps://bit.ly/3SpZk6g. Other economists put that number even higher at $469 billion to $519 billion. \nThe Biden Student Loan Forgiveness Plan: Budgetary Costs and Distributional Impact, Penn Wharton, Univ. of \nPa. (Aug. 26, 2022), https://bit.ly/3UAxpBI. \n  - 11 - \n\nCase 4:22-cv-00908-O   Document 1   Filed 10/10/22    Page 12 of 15   PageID 12\n \n56.  According to the Department, about 8 million borrowers will soon receive automatic \ndebt forgiveness because the government already has these individuals’ income data. One-Time Student \nLoan Debt Relief, supra.  \nIV.  Plaintiffs and Others Excluded from the Debt Forgiveness Program \n57.  Because the Department adopted the Program without going through the notice-and-\ncomment process, Plaintiffs were deprived of their “procedural right to protect [their] concrete \ninterests.” Texas v. EEOC, 933 F.3d 433, 447 (5th Cir. 2019) (cleaned up); see id. (“A violation of the \nAPA’s notice-and-comment requirements is one example of a deprivation of a procedural right.”). \n58.  Plaintiff Myra Brown is one of the millions of Americans who is ineligible for the Debt \nForgiveness Program because her student loan debt is commercially held and not in default.  \n59.  If the Department is going to provide debt forgiveness, Ms. Brown believes that her \nstudent loan debt should be forgiven too. She believes it is irrational, arbitrary, and unfair to exclude \nher from the Program because her student loan debt is commercially held and not in default. Ms. \nBrown  wants  an  opportunity  to  present  her  views  to  the  Department  and  provide  additional \ncomments on any proposal from the Department to forgive student loan debts.  \n60.  Plaintiff Alexander Taylor is one of the millions of Americans who is ineligible for the \nfull $20,000 in debt forgiveness because he did not receive a Pell Grant in college.  \n61.  If the Department is going to provide debt forgiveness, Mr. Taylor believes that his \nstudent loan debt should be forgiven too and that he should not be penalized because he did not \nreceive a Pell Grant in college. Mr. Taylor makes less than $25,000 a year, but he is ineligible for the \nfull $20,000 in debt forgiveness. Yet others making more than five times as much as he does (up to \n$125,000 a year) will receive $20,000 in debt forgiveness if they got a Pell Grant in college. Mr. Taylor \nbelieves that it is irrational, arbitrary, and unfair to calculate the amount of debt forgiveness he receives \nbased on the financial circumstances of his parents many years ago. Mr. Taylor wants an opportunity \n  - 12 - \n\nCase 4:22-cv-00908-O   Document 1   Filed 10/10/22    Page 13 of 15   PageID 13\n \nto present his views to the Department and provide additional comments on any proposal from the \nDepartment to forgive student loan debts.  \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nCOUNT I \nAdministrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §706 \n(Failure to Follow Proper Rulemaking Procedures) \n \n62.  Plaintiffs incorporate all of their prior allegations. \n63.  The APA requires courts to “hold unlawful and set aside agency action[s]” that are \nadopted “without observance of procedure required by law.” 5 U.S.C. §706(2). \n64.  The APA obligates agencies to subject their substantive rules to notice and comment. \nSee 5 U.S.C. §553. \n65.  A “rule” is “an agency statement of general or particular applicability and future effect \ndesigned to implement, interpret, or prescribe law or policy.” 5 U.S.C. §551(4). \n66.  Legislative  rules  typically  “grant  rights,  impose  obligations,  or  produce  other \nsignificant effects on private interests.” W&T Offshore, Inc. v. Bernhardt, 946 F.3d 227, 237 (5th Cir. \n2019). \n67.  Moreover, “[i]f a second rule repudiates or is irreconcilable with a prior legislative rule, \nthe second rule must be an amendment of the first; and, of course, an amendment to a legislative rule \nmust itself be legislative.” Clean Water Action v. EPA, 936 F.3d 308, 314 & n.11 (5th Cir. 2019) (cleaned \nup). \n68.  The Debt Forgiveness Program is a legislative rule.  \n69.  It creates a new program designed to implement a policy of eliminating or reducing \ndebt obligations for certain individuals. 5 U.S.C. §551(4). It “grant[s] rights” by promising to eliminate \nindividuals’ debt, it “impose[s] obligations” on the Department to forgive debt, and it produces \n“significant effects on private interests.” W&T Offshore, Inc., 946 F.3d at 237.   \n  - 13 - \n\nCase 4:22-cv-00908-O   Document 1   Filed 10/10/22    Page 14 of 15   PageID 14\n \n70.  The Program also effectively amends or repeals the Department’s existing regulations \nthat prohibit the Department from forgiving debt except under certain narrow circumstances. See U.S. \nTelecom Ass’n v. FCC, 400 F.3d 29, 35 (D.C. Cir. 2005) (If the agency “effects a substantive change in \nthe regulation, notice and comment are required.” (cleaned up)).  \n71.  In addition, to the extent the Program “pertain[s]” to Title IV of the Higher Education \nAct, the Department was also required to use “negotiated rulemaking” to develop the rule. 20 U.S.C. \n§1098a(b)(2); see The Negotiated Rulemaking Process for Title IV Regulations—Frequently Asked Questions, U.S. \nDep’t of Educ., https://bit.ly/3SCFqFf.  \n72.  The Department adopted the Program without publishing prior notice and affording \nPlaintiffs  and  other  members  of  the  public  an  opportunity  to  submit  written  comments.  The \nDepartment also did not adopt the Program through the “negotiated rulemaking” process. \n73.  Because the Program is a legislative rule that did not go through the proper procedures, \nthe Program must be held unlawful and set aside. See 5 U.S.C. §706(2)(D). \n \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs ask this Court to enter judgment in their favor and to provide \nthem with the following relief: \na.  Declare  that  the  Debt  Forgiveness  Program  has  been  adopted  without  observance  of \nprocedure required by law and therefore violates the APA. \nb.  Preliminarily and permanently enjoin Defendants from enforcing, applying, or implementing \nthe Program anywhere within the Department’s jurisdiction. \nc.  Vacate and set aside the Program. \nd.  Award all other relief to which Plaintiffs are entitled, including but not limited to Plaintiffs’ \nattorneys’ fees and costs. \ne.  Grant all other relief that this Court deems just and proper. \n  - 14 - \n\nCase 4:22-cv-00908-O   Document 1   Filed 10/10/22    Page 15 of 15   PageID 15\n \n \n  Respectfully submitted, \n   \nDated: October 10, 2022   /s/   James F.
