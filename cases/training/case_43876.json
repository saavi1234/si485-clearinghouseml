          "description": "STIPULATION ESTABLISHING PROTOCOL FOR DOCUMENT COLLECTION AND PRODUCTION: The plaintiffs, National Association of the Deaf, Rebecca Alexander, Jazmine Jones, Amber Martin, James Munro, and Mei Nishimoto, and the defendants, Sirius XM Holdings Inc., Stitcher Media LLC, and Pandora Media, LLC (the plaintiffs and defendants collectively the \"Parties\"), through their attorneys, agree that the following Stipulation Establishing Protocol for Document Collection and Production (the \"Protocol\") will govern the discovery of electronically stored information (\"ESI\") in the above-captioned litigation (the \"Action\"). The Parties mutually seek to reduce the time, expense, and other burdens of discovery of certain hard copy documents and ESI, and to better define the scope of their obligations with respect to producing such information and materials. This Protocol does not prevent the Parties from negotiating additional agreements regarding discovery as may be necessary in the course of this Action. Nothing in this Protocol shall affect the Parties' respective storage, preservation or production obligations imposed by rule or law. I. PRESERVATION AND PRODUCTION OF DATA. 1. Compliance & No Waiver. By preserving information that is reasonably anticipated to be subject to discovery in this Action in accordance with the terms of this Protocol the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, or the Local Rules of the Southern District, no party shall be deemed to have waived any objection to particular discovery requests or the scope of discovery. 2. Duty to Preserve. a. All potentially relevant documents, things, and ESI, other than those exempted from preservation in paragraph 4, created before or after the date of entry of this Stipulation and Order, must be preserved in accordance with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the Federal Rules of Evidence, and the relevant controlling principles of law. b. Absent a showing of good cause by a party, activities undertaken in compliance with the duty to preserve information are protected from disclosure and discovery. 3. Definition of ESI. ESI includes: e-mail, digital documents such as word documents, spreadsheets, image files, PDFs; data from a custodian's desktop computer; data from a company server or computer system; data from a hard drive; data from cloud applications; digital scans of physical documents. 4. Not Reasonably Accessible ESI. The Parties agree that the circumstances of this Action generally do not warrant the preservation, collection, review, production, or identification on a privilege log of ESI that is not reasonably accessible, unless the party producing discovery (the \"Producing Party\") believes in good faith that not reasonably accessible ESI is likely to contain significant information not otherwise available in reasonably accessible sources. For purposes of this Paragraph, the Parties agree that the following sources of ESI are not reasonably accessible: a. Data stored in a backup system for the purpose of system recovery or information recovery, including but not limited to: disaster recovery backup tapes and media; continuity of operations systems; and data or system mirrors or shadows. b. Voicemail recordings. c. Delivery or read receipts of emails. d. Mobile devices and ESI or other data stored on mobile devices, including smart phones or tablets. e. Instant/Chat Messaging. f. Legacy Data (e.g., information stored on software or hardware that is outmoded or obsolete, or data whose format has become obsolete and is not and has not been used in the ordinary course since initiation of this action). g. Deleted, erased, or overwritten computer files, whether fragmented or whole, which were deleted in the regular course of business. h. Data stored in Random Access Memory (\"RAM\"), cache memory, or in temporary or cache files, including internet history, web browser cache, and cookie files, wherever located. i. Encrypted data/password protected files, where the key or password cannot be ascertained absent extraordinary efforts. j. Data stored on printers, photocopiers, scanners, and fax machines. k. Data stored as server, system, or network logs. Nothing in this Protocol prevents any Party from asserting, in accordance with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure or the Local Rules of the Southern District that other categories of ESI are not reasonably accessible. Nothing in this Protocol constitutes a waiver or prevents any Party from making a specific request for any category of data outlined above if good cause exists, nor waives or prevents a Producing Party from asserting that any such ESI source is not reasonably accessible because of burden or cost. Any assertion that ESI other than as defined in 4(a)-(j) is not reasonably accessible will not obviate a Party's duty to preserve that discovery, under paragraph 2, absent agreement or a Court order to the contrary. 4. Identification of Collection Sources and Search Term Methodologies. The Parties have the right to meet and confer, and shall confer upon request, regarding: (a) the identity and/or role of custodians possessing relevant information from whom documents will be collected and produced; (b) search methodology and search terms, if any, to be applied, and the potential use of technology assisted review (\"TAR\") or similar technologies; (c) relevant data sources, including custodial, non-custodial, and third-party documents; and (d) any applicable and appropriate time frames for the collection, review, and production of documents. II. ESI PRODUCTION SPECIFICATIONS. 1. Production Formats & Metadata. Except as set forth below, each Party will produce ESI in TIFF format. Documents may be produced as they are kept in the ordinary course of business. Unless not feasible in certain circumstances, all TIFF files will conform to the following specifications: a. TIFF Files. All TIFF files will be single page, black and white TIFF at 300x300 dpi resolution and 81/2 x 11 inch page size, except and to the extent reasonably practicable for documents requiring color or different resolution or page size to be legible and comprehensible. Tracked changes, comments, or notes or other similar information shall be imaged so that this information is captured on the produced image file. b. Production Load Files. Each production of ESI and documents shall include a standard format load file (e.g., Opticon opt, Concordance.Dat, Summation Dii, etc.) containing the production Beginning and Ending Bates numbers and the additional Metadata fields detailed below and the appropriate unitization of the documents and family relationship shall accompany the TIFF production. Except as otherwise agreed by the Parties, all productions shall be made in.opt and.dat file formats. c. Endorsements. All TIFF images shall be branded in the bottom right with a Bates number, using the general format \"ABC_00000001.\" Each page will also be branded in the bottom left corner with the appropriate confidentiality designation consistent with the provisions of a separate Stipulation and Proposed Protective Order governing production and treatment of confidential information in this Action. Bates numbers should contain an alphanumeric prefix followed by an 8-digit number. Any numbers with less than 8 digits will be front padded with zeros to reach the required 8 digits. All ESI produced in TIFF format shall contain a unique Bates number on each page of the document, electronically \"burned\" onto the image at a location to the extent reasonably possible that does not obliterate, conceal, or interfere with any information from the source document. d. Required Metadata. Parties shall produce the following metadata fields, to the extent reasonable possible, with respect to the original electronic document or information, including files produced natively pursuant to Paragraph II.1.e, below: 1. BegBates. 2. EndBates. 3. BegAttach. 4. EndAttach. 5. Parent Bates. 6. Child Bates. 7. Custodian. 8. From. 9. To. 10. CC. 11. BCC. 12. Subject. 13. Importance. 14. Sensitivity. 15. Date Sent. 16. Date Created. 17. Date Modified. 18. Time Modified. 19. Time Zone. 20. File Name. 21. File Type. 22. File Extension. 23. Deduped Custodian. 24. Document Type. 25. Extracted Text Path. 26. MD5 Hash Values. 27. Confidential Designation. 28. Redaction. 29. Production Volume. e. Native Production. Presentation files (e.g., PowerPoint files), spreadsheet files (e.g., Excel files), audio files, video files, and other file types that cannot be accurately converted to image format as described in Paragraph II.1.a., above, shall be produced in native format, unless such documents are redacted. The Producing Party shall produce a single page TIFF \"slip sheet\" page for each such file bearing a Bates number. f. Text Files. The presumptive source of extracted text for produced ESI shall be from the native file. Where a document has been redacted and produced in a.TIFF format, OCR may be used to generate text for the text file. g. Color. The Parties agree that their productions will be made in color. h. Parent-Child Relationships. Parent-child relationships (the association between e-mails and attachments) will be preserved. E-mail attachments will be consecutively produced with the parent e-mail record. For example, if a party produces an e-mail with its attachments, such attachments should be produced behind the e-mail in the order in which they were attached. 2. De-Duplication. To the extent identical copies of ESI exist in a Producing Party's files, the Producing Party need only produce one such identical copy. Each Producing party may remove exact duplicate documents based on MD5 or SHA-1 hash values, at the family level. Attachments should not be eliminated as duplicates for purposes of production, unless the parent email and all attachments are also duplicates. An email that includes content in the BCC or other blind copy field shall not be treated as a duplicate of an email that does not include content in those fields, even if all remaining content in the email is identical. a. If global de-duplication is done across the entire collection, the \"Deduped Custodian\" metadata field, above, will list each agreed production custodian, separated by a semi-colon, who was a source of that document, to the extent such information can be automatically populated by the processing of the documents. b. A party may apply commercially accepted near-duplicate de-duplication software and/or email thread suppression techniques in reviewing and producing ESI. 3. Embedded Objects. Embedded objects or files may be extracted and searched consistent with its category of ESI. Non-substantive embedded files, such as logos, need not be extracted if the identification of such files can be done programmatically. For production purposes, embedded files shall be identified as attachments to the parent document in which the file was embedded, and load files for such embedded files shall refer to the parent document in which the file was embedded. III. HARD COPY PRODUCTION SPECIFICATIONS. 1. Production Formats. Hard copy documents should be scanned and produced electronically. Hard copy documents and attachments should be scanned as single-page, Group IV, 300 DPI TIFF images with an.opt image cross-reference file and a delimited database load file (i.e.,.dat). The database load file should contain the following information: Custodian(s); Begin Bates; End Bates; BegAttach; EndAttach; Confidential Designation; Redaction; OCR Text Path; and Production Volume. a. Where reasonably feasible, hard copy documents should be logically unitized (i.e., distinct documents shall not be merged into a single record, and single documents shall not be split into multiple records) and be produced in the order in which they are kept in the usual course of business. Where possible, original document orientation should be maintained (i.e., portrait to portrait and landscape to landscape) and the Bates number shall be outside of the portions of the imaged pages containing content. b. At the request of the Requesting Party, document pages that have affixed notes, such as Post-it Notes, shall be imaged with and without the note attached. If an original document contains color, then the document produced shall be in color, produced as single-page, 300 DPI JPG images with JPG compression and a high-quality setting as to not degrade the original image. The Parties are under no obligation to enhance an image beyond how it was kept in the usual course of business. c. Multi-page OCR text for each document will also be provided. OCR text files shall be provided as a single text file for each hard copy document, not one text file per page. The File Name itself should match its respective TIFF or JPG File Name. The OCR software shall maximize text quality. Settings such as \"auto-skewing\" and \"autorotation\" should be turned on during the OCR process. Notwithstanding the requirements set forth above, absent a showing of good cause, a Producing Party is not obligated to rescan and re-process hard copy documents that were scanned before the entry of this Protocol. 2. If any Party determines that any of the specific requirements in Part III impose an undue burden or otherwise present an issue with respect to compliance, the Parties shall meet and confer regarding that issue, including discussing any appropriate resolution of that issue or alternative process. IV. REDACTIONS. 1. A Producing Party may redact from any TIFF image, metadata field, or native file material that is protected from disclosure by applicable privilege or immunity from discovery, or that is required by applicable law or regulation. Redactions must be limited to only language or information within document deemed protected by a Producing Party. The Producing Party shall identify redactions clearly on the face of any TIFF image (e.g., \"Redacted - Privileged\"). Redactions for protected information can be made with a black bar. 2. If a document that otherwise would be produced in native format requires redaction, such document may be produced in TIFF format with an OCR text file in accordance with this Protocol. The native file version of redacted documents need not be produced unless the Parties agree otherwise. 3. For any ESI or other discovery withheld, the Parties shall produce a privilege log in accordance with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26 and Local Rule of the Southern District 26.2. V. OTHER ISSUES. 1. Encryption. To maximize the security of information in transit, any production may be encrypted. In such cases, the Producing Party shall transmit the encryption key or password to the Requesting Party or identified designee of same, under separate cover, contemporaneously with sending the encrypted media. 2. Production Methods. Unless otherwise agreed, documents and ESI will be produced via a secure FTP site or similar electronic format as mutually agreed upon by the Parties. 3. English Language. To the extent any document exists in more than one language, the document shall be produced in English, if available in the ordinary course of business or in the custodian's files. If no English version of the document is available, the Producing Party does not have an obligation to produce an English translation. 4. Time Zone Standardization. The Parties acknowledge that if the processing time zone for this Action is not standardized across the entire collection, then the email metadata for custodians in the different time zones will be different, because the time (and possibly the date) would be different. As a result, two copies of the same email may fail to be de-duplicated, and the different time zones could create a convoluted chronology. As a result, to the extent reasonably practicable, the Parties agree to produce their ESI standardized to Eastern Standard Time. 5. Stipulation and Proposed Protective Order. The terms of the separate Agreed Protective Order governing production and treatment of confidential information to be filed with Court are incorporated herein by reference and also govern all production pursuant to this Protocol. 6. Further Conferral. If any Party determines that any of the requirements in this Protocol impose an undue burden or otherwise pose an issue with respect to compliance, the Parties shall meet and confer regarding that issue, including discussing, as appropriate, an alternative process or processes. 7. Producing Party's Right to Review Own Documents. Nothing contained herein limits a Producing Party's right to conduct a review of documents, ESI or information (including metadata) for relevance, responsiveness and/or segregation of privileged and/or protected information before production. 8. No Required Disclosure of Privileged Materials. Nothing in this Protocol shall be interpreted to require disclosure of irrelevant information or relevant information protected by the attorney-client privilege, work-product doctrine, or any other applicable privilege or immunity. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge J. Paul Oetken on 12/27/2022) (ate) (Entered: 12/27/2022)"

    "summary": "<p>This case concerns ensuring podcast accessibility for deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals. On December 9, 2021, the National Association of the Deaf (NAD), alongside five individual plaintiffs who are deaf professionals, filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The plaintiffs sued SiriusXM Holdings Inc., Stitcher Media Inc., and Pandora Media LLC under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), the New York State Human Rights Law (NYSHRL), and the New York City Human Rights Law (NYCHRL). Represented by counsel from Disability Rights Advocates (DRA), the plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief, alleging that the defendants failed to provide podcast transcripts, thereby excluding deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals from their services. The plaintiffs sought a judicial declaration that the defendants' practices were discriminatory and an injunction requiring the provision of transcripts for podcasts, aligning with web content accessibility guidelines and ensuring equal access for all users, irrespective of hearing ability. The plaintiffs also sought compensatory damages, costs, and reasonable attorney's fees. The case was assigned to District Judge James Paul Oetken.</p>\r\n<p>The lawsuit contended that the defendants, each operating extensive podcast streaming services, excluded deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals by not providing transcripts for the majority of their podcast content. This exclusion denied these individuals access to critical news sources, entertainment, and education available to hearing customers, violating accessibility laws. The plaintiffs pointed out that producing transcripts was technically feasible, with much of the process automatable through speech recognition technologies, yet the defendants chose not to use these solutions.</p>\r\n<p>SiriusXM, Stitcher, and Pandora were accused of not only failing to make their original content accessible but also of not providing transcripts for third-party podcast content (extending the issue to include external content not originally produced by the defendants) that didn't offer their own transcripts, further limiting access for deaf and hard-of-hearing users. The complaint detailed the significant investments and acquisitions by SiriusXM to expand its podcast offerings, highlighting the breadth and exclusivity of content unavailable to a segment of the population due to these accessibility barriers.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs asserted that the defendants' failure to provide accessible content harmed their professional development, education, and leisure activities. Despite attempts to resolve these issues without litigation, sufficient commitments to remedy the accessibility barriers were not obtained, leading to litigation to end the ongoing discrimination and ensure equal access to podcast content for deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals across the United States.</p>\r\n<p>On March 29, 2023, the parties stipulated to the dismissal of the claims of one of the named plaintiffs.</p>\r\n<p>Discovery is ongoing. The case is ongoing.</p>",

SiriusXM Holdings Inc. (“SiriusXM”), Stitcher Media Inc. (“Stitcher”), and\nPandora Media LLC. (“Pandora”), (collectively “Defendants”) each operate an extensive \npodcast streaming service that offers users information on a wide range of subjects, including \ncurrent events, entertainment, science, history, and politics, and provide audiences original \ncontent available only in the podcast medium. However, Defendants fail to provide transcripts \nfor the vast majority of their podcast content, despite the fact that it is relatively simple to do \nso, particularly given that much of the work to produce transcripts can be automated,1 and \ndespite requests from the deaf and hard of-hearing community for access to their \nprogramming. Defendants’ failures to provide transcripts of their podcasts excludes deaf and \nhard-of-hearing \n1Automatic speech recognition (“ASR”) technology enables the recognition and translation of \nspoken language into text by computer. Transcripts then require a minimally burdensome human \ncleanup to ensure accuracy and labeling of speakers.  \n-1-\n\nCase 1:21-cv-10542   Document 1   Filed 12/09/21   Page 2 of 36\npersons from the critical sources of news, entertainment, educational programs, and popular \nculture that Defendants make available to their hearing customers, in violation of  the Americans \nwith Disabilities Act (“ADA”), the New York State Human Rights Law (“NYSHRL”), and the \nNew York City Human Rights Law (“NYCHRL”). \n2.  Defendant SiriusXM bills itself as the “new destination for original, exclusive, \nand popular podcasts,”2 providing customers access to a slate of both original and third-party \npodcast content on its website and mobile application. This content includes exclusive interviews \nwith celebrities like Kevin Hart in the SiriusXM original podcast Comedy Gold Minds and \nscripted entertainment series, including the star-studded, SiriusXM original series Marvel \nWastelanders Old Man Star-Lord. SiriusXM has invested heavily in podcasts in the last several \nyears, acquiring Pandora in 2018 and Stitcher in 2020.  \n3.  Similarly, Defendant Stitcher, a media company exclusively focused on \nproducing and streaming podcasts, asserts that it is “the best place for podcasts.”3  It is home to \none of the largest podcast listening applications, providing users access to the hundreds of \nthousands of podcasts in its library, including hundreds of original shows, which it often \nprovides exclusive access to on its mobile application. This includes Stitcher-produced content \nsuch as Peabody award nominee Unfinished: Deep South, a podcast that investigates the \nunsolved murder of Isadore Banks, one of the wealthiest African-Americans on the Arkansas \nDelta; Time For My Stories which examines the arc of the United States through the lens of the \nTV drama; and Hollywood Masterclass, a series which explores the human psyche. Stitcher \n \n2 SiriusXM is the New Destination for Original, Exclusive, and Popular Podcasts, SiriusXM, 1 \n(2020), https://s1.q4cdn.com/750174072/files/doc_news/SiriusXM-is-the-New-Destination-for-\nOriginal-Exclusive-and-Popular-Podcasts-2020.pdf.  \n3 About Us, Stitcher, https://www.stitcher.com/about (last visited Dec. 7, 2021). \n  -2-   \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-10542   Document 1   Filed 12/09/21   Page 3 of 36\nranked #1 in Triton Digital's Report of top Podcast Networks for August 2021, with 451 active \noriginal podcasts, 31 million average weekly downloads and 9.6 million weekly users. Stitcher \nreported a revenue of $73 million in 2019 (up 42% over the previous year).   \n4.  Likewise, Defendant Pandora, a popular audio streaming service which boasted \n55.9 million monthly active users as of 2021, launched its podcast program in 2018 and has \nquickly seen its “rich catalog of podcasts [] increased over 5x to now boast thousands of shows \nand over 600,000 episodes across a broad range of genres.”4 Pandora’s library features an \nextensive assortment of original SiriusXM and Stitcher podcasts such as SiriusXM’s Andy \nCohen’s Deep & Shallow Interviews, in which Andy Cohen has one-on-one conversations with \nsome of the world’s biggest stars, SiriusXM’s Joel Osteen, in which pastors Joel and Victoria \nOsteen share their daily message of inspiration for an empowered and spirit-filled life; and My \nFavorite Murder, a Stitcher original true-crime, comedy podcast that was ranked second on \nForbes’s 2019 list of highest-earning podcasters. \n5.  In addition to their original and exclusive content, all Defendants also provide \naccess to third-party content, including investigative, true-crime series like the Peabody award-\nwinning, smash hit Serial, which has seen over 250 million downloads since its 2014 debut; self-\nhelp information, like The Ramsey Show, which provides advice on finance and, occasionally, \nmoney-related Christian philosophy; and timely explorations of race and identity like the NPR \nPodcast Code Switch, which saw a 270% surge in downloads in the summer of 2020 following \nthe wave of protests against police brutality triggered by the murders of George Floyd and \nBreonna Taylor. \n \n4 Podcasts on Pandora Now Available on the Web and Pandora’s Desktop App, Pandora: \nPandora Blog (Nov. 12, 2019) https://blog.pandora.com/us/podcasts-on-pandora-now-available-\non-the-web-and-pandoras-desktop-app/. \n  -3-   \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-10542   Document 1   Filed 12/09/21   Page 4 of 36\n6.  By combining exclusive content, original content, and third-party content, \nDefendants provide their hearing customers a one-stop shop for exploring, discovering, \ndownloading, subscribing, and managing most or all of the podcasts they will consume. \n7.  Yet, Defendants exclude deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals from enjoying and \nlearning from these same programs. Defendants’ failure to provide transcripts for nearly all of \nthe original and third-party podcast content available through each of their podcast streaming \nservices, even when transcripts are available from third-party podcast producers, denies deaf and \nhard-of-hearing persons access to the benefits Defendants offer their hearing users. Indeed, \nDefendants’ failures clearly ignore the mandates of the ADA, which requires companies that \nprovide their services to the general public to provide these services in a manner that is \naccessible to people with disabilities.  \n8.  Plaintiffs National Association of the Deaf (“NAD”), Rebecca Alexander, \nJazmine Jones, Dr. Amber Martin, James Munro, and Mei Nishimoto (collectively “Named \nPlaintiffs”), consist of an organization that advocates by and on behalf of the deaf and hard-of-\nhearing and five deaf working professionals who wish to utilize podcasts in their personal and \nprofessional lives but are unable to do so because of Defendants’ failures to make their  podcasts \naccessible to them. This failure harms all Plaintiffs, along with approximately 48 million \nAmericans who are deaf or hard of hearing, by denying them the benefits of Defendants’ \nprogramming, which affects their professional development, their ability to educate themselves \non topics both professionally and personally, and even impacts their parenting. Defendants’ \n  -4-   \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-10542   Document 1   Filed 12/09/21   Page 5 of 36\nrefusals to provide transcripts5 for the podcasts available on their podcast streaming services thus \ndenies Plaintiffs the full and equal enjoyment of the content Defendants offer their hearing users. \n9.  Plaintiffs attempted to resolve this matter without a lawsuit but were unable to \nobtain sufficient commitments from Defendants to remedy these barriers to full and equal access.  \n10.  The Named Plaintiffs now bring this lawsuit to end the ongoing civil rights \nviolations Defendants commit against deaf and hard-of-hearing persons in New York and \nthroughout the United States. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n11.  This is an action for declaratory and injunctive relief and compensatory damages, \nwhere applicable, brought pursuant to Title III of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12181 et seq. (“Title \nIII”), the  New York State Human Rights Law (“NYSHRL”), N.Y. Exec. Law, Article 15 \n(Executive Law § 290 et seq.), and the New York City Human Rights Law (“NYCHRL”), \nN.Y.C. Admin. Code § 8-101 et seq. The Court has power to issue such relief pursuant to 28 \nU.S.C. §§ 2201 and 2202. \n12.  This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action under 28 U.S.C. \n§§ 1331 and 1343 for claims arising under the ADA. \n13.  The Court has subject matter jurisdiction over the action over the NYSHRL and \nNYCHRL claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1367. \n \n5 All or nearly all podcasts currently available in Defendants’ podcast libraries contain no visual \nelements. To the extent Defendants currently offer, or begin to offer, podcasts with a video \nelement, Plaintiffs also demand closed captioning that displays synchronously with the video.  \n \n  -5-   \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-10542   Document 1   Filed 12/09/21   Page 6 of 36\n14.  Following the commencement of this action, a copy of this Complaint will be \nserved both on the New York City Commission for Human Rights and the Office of the \nCorporation Counsel of the City of New York, thereby satisfying the notice requirements of the \nNew York City Administrative Code. \n15.  Venue is proper in this District pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391 because a substantial \npart of the events or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred and continue to occur within this \ndistrict.  SiriusXM, Stitcher, and Pandora each operates its internet-based, audio and streaming \nbusiness in this District, and each Defendant has sufficient contacts to be subject to personal \njurisdiction in this District.  A substantial part of the acts or omissions giving rise to Plaintiffs’ \nclaims occurred in this District. Plaintiffs Martin and Alexander live and work in the district.  \nPARTIES \n16.  Plaintiff NAD is the nation’s premier civil rights organization of, by, and for deaf \nand hard-of-hearing individuals. The NAD is organized as a non-profit corporation under the \nlaws of the State of Maryland and has its national headquarters in Silver Spring, Maryland. The \nNAD’s membership includes individuals and associations from all fifty states and Washington, \nD.C.

Plaintiff Rebecca Alexander resides in New York City, New York and is deaf. \nMs. Alexander has not registered for or purchased an account with any Defendant because she is \naware that virtually none of their podcasts are accessible, but she would do so if Defendants \nprovided transcripts for their podcast content.    \n18.  Plaintiff Jazmine Jones resides in Buffalo, New York and is deaf. Ms. Jones has \nnot registered for or purchased an account with any Defendant because she is aware that virtually \n  -6-   \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-10542   Document 1   Filed 12/09/21   Page 7 of 36\nnone of their podcasts are accessible, but she would do so if Defendants provided transcripts for \ntheir podcast content.    \n19.  Plaintiff Dr. Amber Martin resides in Pleasantville, New York and is deaf. Ms. \nMartin has not registered for or purchased an account with any Defendant because she is aware \nthat virtually none of their podcasts are accessible, but she would do so if Defendants provided \ntranscripts for their podcast content.       \n20.  Plaintiff James Munro resides in Macedon, New York and is deaf. Mr. Munro has \nnot registered for or purchased an account with any Defendant because he is aware that virtually \nnone of their podcasts are accessible, but he would do so if Defendants provided transcripts for \ntheir podcast content.    \n21.  Plaintiff Mei Nishimoto resides in Seattle, Washington and is deaf. Ms. \nNishimoto has not registered for or purchased an account with any Defendant because she is \naware that virtually none of their podcasts are accessible, but she would do so if Defendants \nprovided transcripts for their podcast content.    \n22.  Defendant SiriusXM has its collective United States headquarters in New York, \nNew York. It operates a podcast streaming service that customers can access through its website \n(https://www.siriusxm.com/) or through a mobile application.  \n23.

Defendant Pandora has its U.S. headquarters in Oakland, California and has its \nsecond largest office in New York City. It operates a podcast streaming service that customers \ncan access through its website (https://www.pandora.com/) or through a mobile application.  \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \nI.  Defendants Each Provide Podcast Streaming Services to Hearing Individuals but \nExclude Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing Individuals. \n25.  Podcasts are a rapidly growing form of media that offer consumers access to on-\ndemand content on a variety of subjects, including news, entertainment, science, history, and \npolitics. \n26.  The primary format of most podcasts is an audio recording of spoken words and \nrelated audio, which is not available in any visual way. \n27.   Consumers typically access podcasts through third-party applications, like \nDefendants’, which allow them to subscribe and listen to podcasts, as well as download them for \noffline use. \n28.  Each Defendant operates a podcast streaming service that grants their customers \naccess to a large library of podcast content. Users can stream this content on demand in a variety \nof ways including through: Defendants’ websites, Defendants’ mobile applications, smart TVs, \nAmazon Alexa devices, Apple TV, Sony PlayStation, Roku, or Sonos speakers. For many \npodcasts, customers can also download them to listen to offline at a later time. Defendants’ \nmobile applications all provide their users access to thousands of hours of on-demand podcast \ncontent.  \n29.  Some third-party podcast creators independently provide transcripts of their \npodcasts which they make available on their third-party websites. Yet none of the Defendants \n  -8-   \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-10542   Document 1   Filed 12/09/21   Page 9 of 36\nprovide these transcripts on their podcast streaming service, either on their websites or mobile \napplications. This means that deaf and hard-of-hearing users cannot access those transcripts on \nDefendants’ podcast streaming service and must instead locate the transcripts on the third party’s \nown website, creating considerable additional work over the easy and integrated user experience \nthat nondisabled users of Defendants’ platforms enjoy.  \n30.  Just as Defendants do not provide transcripts for their own original podcasts, none \nof the Defendants provide transcripts for third-party-created podcasts that do not provide their \nown transcripts elsewhere. Because Defendants also do not provide transcripts for these \npodcasts, deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals users have no way to engage with this content and \nare completely denied access to content made available to Defendants’ users.    \na.  Sirius XM \n31.  Defendant SiriusXM describes itself as “the leading audio entertainment company \nin North America” and the “home of exclusive and popular podcasts including many original \nseries and a highly-curated selection of podcasts from leading creators and providers.”6 \n32.  To access SiriusXM’s podcasts, users must create a SiriusXM account and \npurchase a subscription. The most basic package available offers customers access to the \nSiriusXM app for $10.99 a month. Users who purchase this basic package have full access to all \nthe podcasts in SiriusXM’s library.  Users who purchase an account may also utilize SiriusXM’s \nmobile application for engaging with SiriusXM’s podcasts. \n33.  SiriusXM has invested heavily in podcasts in the last several years. \n \n6 Corporate Information: About Sirius XM, SiriusXM, \nhttps://www.siriusxm.com/corporate?intcmp=FullFooter_NA_www:Home_AboutSiriusXM (last \nvisited Dec. 7, 2021). \n  -9-   \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-10542   Document 1   Filed 12/09/21   Page 10 of 36\n34.  Between 2018 and 2020 SiriusXM paid over 3.5 billion dollars to acquire several \nmajor podcast providers. In 2018, SiriusXM paid $3.5 billion to acquire Pandora. \n35.  In 2020 SiriusXM paid $325 million to acquire Stitcher. \n36.  In June 2020, SiriusXM further expanded into the podcast business by acquiring \nSimplecast, a leading podcast management platform that enables podcast creators to publish, \nmanage, and measure their content. SiriusXM combined the power of Simplecast with another \ncompany it acquired, AdsWizz, to offer a full suite of monetization options for podcast creators.  \n37.  In addition to hosting a vast library of podcasts from third-party creators, \nSiriusXM’s podcast streaming service offers exclusive content not available on other podcast \napplications outside of SiriusXM and its subsidiaries. This includes content such as: I Want My \n80s Podcast, in which MTV VJs flash back to discuss and give personal insights into the \ndefining moments of the 80s; Top of the World: Lessons from Rebuilding the World Trade \nCenter, an 11-part series featuring individuals at the heart of the effort to rebuild the World \nTrade Center; and Podversaries, a series that tells the stories behind rivalries in sports history.  \n38.  SiriusXM’s vast podcast library also includes: \n•  Dozens of original podcasts created and produced by SiriusXM. Several of \nthose original podcasts are the result of a 2019 multiyear deal between \nSiriusXM and Marvel Entertainment, in which Marvel agreed to produce a \nsubstantial number of both scripted and unscripted podcasts - many of \nwhich debut exclusively on SiriusXM for several months before they are \navailable to listeners on other podcast platforms. Another original \nSiriusXM podcast is Book Club with Michael Smerconish, which covers \n  -10-   \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-10542   Document 1   Filed 12/09/21   Page 11 of 36\ninterviews with Michael Smerconish, whose mission is to create a \nclearinghouse for non-ideological thinking;  \n•  Over 60 podcasts from its subsidiary Stitcher’s catalog of original and \nStitcher produced podcast content including popular shows such as Science \nRules!

SiriusXM’s podcast streaming service also offers its users an array of unique \nservices including: \n•  A “Recommended For You” section which provides recommendations of \nadditional podcasts to listen to based on listening history;  \n•  Curated lists to help customers find podcast content that might be of \ninterest. These categories include “For Kids,” “Road Trip Listens,” \n“Taking Care of Yourself,” and more.  \n40.  SiriusXM does not provide transcripts for any of the podcasts available on its \npodcast streaming service.   \nb.  Stitcher  \n41.  Defendant Stitcher is the top podcast publisher in the US, as measured by Triton \nDigital.  It currently produces seventeen of the Top 100 Podcasts in the United States by Average \nWeekly Downloads, including True Crime Garage, Small Town Murder, and StarTalk Radio.  \n  -11-   \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-10542   Document 1   Filed 12/09/21   Page 12 of 36\n42.  Individuals may stream much of Stitcher’s content directly by going to its \nwebsite. Users may also utilize Stitcher’s mobile application for engaging with Stitcher’s \npodcasts. To utilize Stitcher’s mobile application, users must create a Stitcher account. Users \nalso have the option of purchasing a subscription with Stitcher for $4.99 a month or $34.99 a \nyear. A premium subscription provides customers access to special benefits including over \n60,000 hours of premium podcasts, ad-free listening, early access to certain podcasts, and other \nexclusive perks such as monthly giveaways and bonus episodes of certain Stitcher podcasts.  \n43.  Stitcher’s vast podcast library includes: \n•  Over 50 Stitcher original podcast shows, created and produced \nby Stitcher, such as the James Beard Award Winner, The \nSporkful.  \n•  A slate of over 500 shows produced by Stitcher, with over 50 \npodcasts from the comedy podcasting network Earwolf, \nincluding its flagship show Comedy Bang!

Stitcher’s podcast streaming service also offers its users an array of unique \nservices including: \n  -12-   \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-10542   Document 1   Filed 12/09/21   Page 13 of 36\n•  A variety of playback controls that allow users to control the play speed \nand rewind timing of each podcast episode;  \n•  Advanced episode search, filtering, and sorting to help users find podcasts \nand “Up Next” queue to keep track of podcasts they may be interested in;  \n•  The ability to organize your podcasts into custom playlists. \n45.  While a small minority of Stitcher-produced podcasts independently provide \ntranscripts for their podcasts on their third-party websites, Stitcher does not provide transcripts \nfor any of the Stitcher original podcasts or third-party podcasts available on its podcast streaming \nservice and does not integrate any transcripts onto its website or mobile application.  \nc.  Pandora \n46.  Defendant Pandora is one of the leading platforms enabling users to discover new \nmusic and podcasts. Powered by the Genome Project, Pandora provides automated \nrecommendations which allows users to find new music and podcasts based on their tastes. \n47.  With its podcast launch in 2018, Pandora aimed to solve the question of “‘What \npodcast should I listen to?’. . .

The NAD’s mission is to preserve, protect and promote the civil, human and \nlinguistic rights of deaf and hard-of-hearing people in the United States of America. This mission \nincludes ensuring that important tools of daily life – such as websites and applications conveying \nuseful and educational information to the general public – are accessible to deaf and hard-of-\nhearing people. \n54.  The NAD furthers this mission in a variety of ways. For example, the NAD \nprovides guidance about effective captioning on its website and administers the Described and \nCaptioned Media Program (“DCMP”) through a cooperative agreement with the U.S. \nDepartment of Education. The DCMP promotes equal access to communication and learning \nthrough described and captioned educational media. The DCMP provides services designed to \nsupport and improve the academic achievement of students who are blind, low-vision, deaf, \n  -15-   \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-10542   Document 1   Filed 12/09/21   Page 16 of 36\nhard-of-hearing, or DeafBlind. The DCMP has a library of more than 4,000 titles of described \nand captioned educational media available for loan to teachers, parents, and students who are \ndeaf, hard of hearing, blind, low-vision, or DeafBlind. \n55.  Additionally, the NAD works for passage of legislation guaranteeing equal access \nand effective communication for individuals who are deaf and hard-of-hearing. For example, the \nNAD has been instrumental in the passage of the Twenty-First Century Communications and \nVideo Accessibility Act of 2010 (“CVAA”), P.L. No. 111-260. \n56.  The NAD also devotes resources to educating its members and members of the \npublic regarding their right to access educational programs through informative videos in \nAmerican Sign Language, sharing advocacy letters through its social media postings and on its \nwebsites, and publishing position papers on its website. \n57.  The NAD has standing to sue as an association on behalf of its deaf and hard-of-\nhearing members, as Defendants’ unlawful conduct interferes with the rights of NAD members \nto have full and equal access to all aspects of society. As described further below, NAD members \nJazmine Jones, Dr. Amber Martin, and James Munro have standing to sue as individuals because \nthey are injured by Defendants’ failure to provide access via ensuring transcripts of their \npodcasts. These NAD members would subscribe to Defendants’ platforms if the podcasts had \ncaptioning or transcripts available for them to access. The NAD advocates on behalf of these \nmembers and all other members, which is the essence of the NAD’s mission of preserving, \nprotecting, and promoting the civil, human, and linguistic rights of all deaf and hard-of-hearing \npeople in the United States. The NAD pursues this action as an organizational plaintiff on behalf \nof its members other than those named here to pursue declaratory and injunctive relief and not \nindividualized remedies, so those other unnamed members are not required to participate in this \n  -16-   \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-10542   Document 1   Filed 12/09/21   Page 17 of 36\naction. The NAD has received complaints about the inaccessibility of podcasts from its members \nas well as other deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals from all over the country.  \nb.  Rebecca Alexander  \n58.  Plaintiff Rebecca Alexander is a psychotherapist and author who lives in New \nYork City, New York. Ms. Alexander is deaf.  \n59.  Ms. Alexander has Usher syndrome type III and has been progressively losing her \nhearing since she was a teenager. She once enjoyed utilizing a variety of podcasts but stopped \nwhen listening without transcripts became too difficult.  \n60.  Ms. Alexander’s profession requires her to rely significantly on her residual \nhearing for psychotherapy sessions, resulting in auditory fatigue.9 As a result, her leisure \nactivities involve reading as opposed to listening.  \n61.  Ms. Alexander’s clients recommend podcasts that Ms. Alexander would like to \nengage with, but she is deterred from seeking them out because of accessibility barriers. Ms. \nAlexander would like to access these and other podcasts relevant to her professional \ndevelopment, such as podcasts about mental health and meditation. \n62.  Ms. Alexander is also interested in accessing comedy and news podcasts.  \n63.  Ms. Alexander requires transcripts to fully access podcast material as she relies on \nreading transcripts while simultaneously listening to completely comprehend the podcast \nmaterial. \n \n9 The American Academy of Audiology describes listening fatigue as fatigue caused by the \nincrease in cognitive resources those with hearing loss require to listen to speech. In order to \ncompensate for the hearing loss, the brain has to work harder than before to process the same \ninformation, causing stress on the brain and fatigue that nondisabled individuals do not \nexperience. https://www.audiology.org/consumers-and-patients/hearing-and-balance/fatigue/.  \n  -17-   \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-10542   Document 1   Filed 12/09/21   Page 18 of 36\n64.  Ms. Alexander would like to use Defendants’ podcast streaming services to engage \nwith podcasts on these and other topics but has not registered for an account or purchased a \nsubscription with any Defendant because she knows they do not provide transcripts for their \npodcasts. Ms. Alexander is particularly interested in accessing the SiriusXM original podcasts \nVital Signs and Signal Boost and the Stitcher produced podcasts Imani State of Mind and The \nPsychology Podcast but no Defendant makes transcripts for these or any other podcast available \non its streaming service. Without transcripts, Ms. Alexander does not have full and equal access \nto  Defendants’  podcast-streaming  offerings. Ms.  Alexander  would  use  each  of  Defendants’ \npodcast streaming services if they provided transcripts for their podcast content. Ms. Alexander \nwould like to manage all her podcasts in as few platforms as possible, as hearing listeners do, but \nDefendants’ failure to include even existing third-party transcripts in their services makes this \nimpossible. \nc.  Jazmine Jones  \n65.  Plaintiff Jazmine Jones is the Program Director of an educational program \nutilizing videos in ASL for a nonprofit organization, Communication Services for the Deaf. Ms. \nJones has also worked as a social media content manager. Ms. Jones lives in Buffalo, New York, \nis deaf, and is a member of the NAD. \n66.  Ms. Jones is very involved in social media and is constantly engaging with others \nthrough various social media outlets. Ms. Jones relies on keeping up with the latest in media \nprogramming and social media usage, and enjoys learning and acquiring new skills from a \nvariety of platforms. Ms. Jones has long wanted to access podcasts on various topics such as \npersonal finance, gardening, astrology, end of life, and spirituality through captioning and \ntranscripts. \n  -18-   \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-10542   Document 1   Filed 12/09/21   Page 19 of 36\n67.  Ms. Jones would like to use Defendants’ podcast streaming services to engage \nwith podcasts on these and other topics but has not registered for an account or purchased a \nsubscription with any Defendant because she knows they do not provide transcripts for their \npodcasts. Ms. Jones is particularly interested in accessing the SiriusXM original podcast All \nMusic is Black Music and the Stitcher original podcast Levar Burton Reads, the Stitcher \nproduced podcast Seizing Freedom and the podcast Lil Rel - I Know You Hear Me, But Are You \nListening?, but no Defendant makes transcripts for these or any other podcast available on its \nstreaming service. Without transcripts, Ms. Jones does not have full and equal access to \nDefendants’ podcast-streaming offerings. Ms. Jones would use each of Defendants’ podcast \nstreaming services if they provided transcripts for their podcast content. Ms. Jones would like to \nmanage all her podcasts in as few platforms as possible, as hearing listeners do, but Defendants’ \nfailure to include even existing third-party transcripts in their services makes this impossible. \nd.  Amber Martin \n68.  Plaintiff Dr. Amber Martin teaches Developmental Psychology as a Lecturer \nDoctoral at Hunter College in New York City, New York. Dr. Martin is deaf and a member of \nthe NAD. \n69.  As an academic professor of psychology at a highly regarded college, Dr. Martin \nis constantly reviewing and learning new information relevant to her field and other fields such \nas general science and anything relating to nature. She is also interested in linguistics. Dr. Martin \nhas long wanted to access podcasts on these and other topics through captioning and transcripts. \nDr. Martin would also like to include podcasts in her curriculum but has been deterred from \ndoing so because transcripts are not readily available.   \n  -19-   \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-10542   Document 1   Filed 12/09/21   Page 20 of 36\n70.  Dr. Martin would like to use Defendants’ podcast streaming services to engage with \npodcasts on these and other topics but has not registered for an account or purchased a subscription \nwith any Defendant because she knows they do not provide transcripts for their podcasts. Dr. \nMartin is particularly interested in accessing the SiriusXM original podcasts Vital Signs and \nCoronavirus: Everything You Need to Know and the Stitcher produced podcasts Atlas Obscura \nand Science Rules! with Bill Nye but no Defendant makes transcripts for these or any other podcast \navailable on its streaming service.  \n71.  Without transcripts, Dr. Martin does not have full and equal access to Defendants’ \npodcast-streaming offerings.  \n72.  Dr. Martin would use each of Defendants’ podcast streaming services if they \nprovided transcripts for their podcast content.    \n73.  Dr. Martin has enjoyed reading the transcripts from podcasts of RadioLab. She is \nalso interested in accessing the podcast This American Life.  \n74.  Although RadioLab and This American Life independently provides transcripts \nfor many of their podcasts, their transcripts are not available with Defendants’ podcast streaming \nservices so customers cannot use Defendants’ platform to read those transcripts. Dr. Martin \nwould like to manage all her podcasts in as few platforms as possible, as hearing listeners do, but \nDefendants’ failure to include even existing third-party transcripts in their services makes this \nimpossible. \ne.  James Munro  \n75.  Plaintiff James Munro is the Associate Director for Admissions and Data for the \nNational Technical Institute of the Deaf, a college within the Rochester Institute of Technology. \nMr. Munro is deaf and a member of the NAD. \n  -20-   \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-10542   Document 1   Filed 12/09/21   Page 21 of 36\n76.  As a tech professional within a highly regarded technological university, Mr. \nMunro is constantly reviewing and learning new information relevant to his field and other fields \nsuch as politics, geography, history, and many other topics. Mr. Munro has long wanted to access \npodcasts on these and other topics through transcripts.  \n77.  Mr. Munro has enjoyed reading the transcripts from podcasts of Malcolm \nGladwell’s Revisionist History10 as well as Freakonomics.   \n78.  Although there are independently available transcripts for many of the episodes of \nRevisionist History and Freakonomics, the transcripts are not available with Defendants’ podcast \nstreaming services so customers cannot use Defendants’ platforms to read those transcripts. \n79.  Mr. Munro is also interested in accessing podcasts to learn about a variety of \nother topics, including sports (especially hockey), politics, fitness (particularly yoga), and shows \nwith a celebrity interview format. However, he has been deterred from seeking these podcasts \nout because he knows the none of Defendants provide transcripts for their podcasts. \n80.  Mr. Munro would like to use the podcast streaming services to engage with \npodcasts on these and other topics but has not registered for an account or purchased a \nsubscription with any Defendant because he knows they do not provide transcripts for their \npodcasts. Mr. Munro is particularly interested in accessing the SiriusXM original podcasts Flutie \nFlakescast, The Ramsey Show, The Jess Cagle Podcast with Julia Cunningham, and Series A \nwith Keith Rabois and the Stitcher produced podcasts Seizing Freedom,  but no Defendant makes \ntranscripts available for these or any other podcast available on its streaming service. Without \ntranscripts, Mr. Munro does not have full and equal access to Defendants’ podcast-streaming \nofferings. Mr. Munro would use each of Defendants’ podcast streaming services if they provided \n \n \n  -21-   \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-10542   Document 1   Filed 12/09/21   Page 22 of 36\ntranscripts for their podcast content.  Mr. Munro would like to manage all his podcasts in as few \nplatforms as possible, as hearing listeners do, but Defendants’ failure to include even existing \nthird-party transcripts in their services makes this impossible. \nf.  Mei Nishimoto  \n81.  Plaintiff Mei Nishimoto tutors children in ASL and other subjects through the \ninternet. Ms. Nishimoto lives in Seattle, Washington and is deaf. \n82.  Ms. Nishimoto is as a lifelong learner who enjoys educating herself about  \nhistory, animals, languages, linguistics, and other subjects through articles, podcasts, and books. \n83.  Ms. Nishimoto enjoys reading podcasts on a variety of subjects. She enjoys \npodcasts available from Slate, including Lexicon Valley, a linguistics podcast, and Dear \nPrudence, an advice podcast. She is able to engage with these podcasts because Slate provides \ntranscripts for its podcasts on its website.  \n84.  Ms. Nishimoto also enjoys a variety of NPR podcasts, especially those focused on \narts and culture. One of her favorites is Code Switch, a podcast for which NPR provides weekly \ntranscripts. Although Slate and NPR independently provide transcripts for many of their \npodcasts, the transcripts are not available on Defendants’ websites or mobile applications, so \ncustomers cannot use Defendants’ platforms to read those transcripts.  \n85.  Ms. Nishimoto has a  daughter who is in Kindergarten. She would like to further \nher daughter’s education by sharing a variety of scholastic podcasts with her. She learns about \nsome of these educational podcasts from a Facebook group for children’s education. However, \nbecause there are not transcripts available for these podcasts, Ms. Nishimoto is unable to screen \nthem beforehand and make sure they are age appropriate and educational for her daughter. As a \nresult, she is unable to access educational podcasts and share them with her daughter.  \n  -22-   \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-10542   Document 1   Filed 12/09/21   Page 23 of 36\n86.  Ms. Nishimoto would like to use Defendants’ podcast streaming services to \nengage with podcasts on these and other topics, but has not registered for an account or \npurchased a subscription with any Defendant because she knows they do not provide transcripts \nfor their podcasts.

Without transcripts, \nMs. Nishimoto does not have full and equal access to Defendants’ podcast-streaming offerings. \nMs. Nishimoto would use each of Defendants’ podcast streaming services if they provided \ntranscripts for their podcast content.   Ms. Nishimoto would like to manage all her podcasts in as \nfew platforms as possible, as hearing listeners do, but Defendants’ failure to include even \nexisting third-party transcripts in their services makes this impossible. \nIII.  The Technology Exists and Standards Require Defendants to Make Podcasts \nAccessible to People who are Deaf or Hard of Hearing \n87.  Deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals seek to access audio content, including \npodcasts, through transcripts, which provide transliteration of the content as it occurs, sometimes \nincluding description of non-speech elements. \n88.  The World Wide Web Consortium’s (“W3C”) Web Content Accessibility \nGuidelines (“WCAG”) 2.1 provide useful standards for making web content accessible, \nincluding making content accessible to individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing. \n89.  WCAG 2.1 Guideline 1.2.2 states that captions should be provided for \nprerecorded audio content in synchronized media, which includes podcasts.  \n  -23-   \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-10542   Document 1   Filed 12/09/21   Page 24 of 36\n90.    Providers of video streaming services, such as Hulu and Netflix, provide \ncaptions for most of their video content. Other podcast services such as Spotify, and other \npodcast producers, such as NPR and Slate, provide transcripts for their podcast content.  \n91.  ASR technology enables the recognition and translation of spoken language into \ntext by computer. Transcripts then require a minimally burdensome human cleanup to ensure \naccuracy and labeling of speakers. Despite this readily available technology that would render \ntheir podcast streaming service accessible with some additional oversight to deaf and hard-of-\nhearing individuals, Defendants choose to exclude these potential users on the basis of disability \nby refusing to provide transcripts.    \n92.  Congress provided a clear national mandate for the elimination of discrimination \nagainst individuals with disabilities when it enacted the ADA. Such discrimination includes \nbarriers to full integration, independent living, and equal opportunity for persons with \ndisabilities, including those barriers created by inaccessible services in places of public \naccommodation, such as Defendants’ podcast streaming services.  \n93.  Despite this mandate, deaf and hard-of-hearing people do not have equal access to \nDefendants’ podcast streaming services. By refusing to make its podcast streaming service \naccessible to deaf and hard-of-hearing persons, all Defendants violate basic equal access \nrequirements under state and local law. \n94.  On August 17, 2021, Named Plaintiffs notified each Defendant of the unlawful \naccessibility barriers described herein and requested that Defendants make a timely commitment  \nto make their services accessible as required under current law. \n95.  Defendants have failed to make such a commitment and their violations continue. \nFIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n  -24-   \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-10542   Document 1   Filed 12/09/21   Page 25 of 36\nViolations of Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act \n(42 U.S.C. § 12182) \n96.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference each and every allegation contained in the \nforegoing paragraphs. \n97.  Pursuant to Title III of the ADA, “[n]o individual shall be discriminated against \non the basis of disability in the full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, \nprivileges, advantages, or accommodations of any place of public accommodation by any person \nwho owns, leases (or leases to), or operates a place of public accommodation.”  42 U.S.C. § \n12182(a). \n98.  Discrimination under Title III includes the denial of an opportunity for the person  \nwith a disability, such as those who are deaf or hard of hearing, to participate in programs or \nservices or providing a service that is not as effective as what is provided to others. 42 U.S.C. § \n12182(b)(1)(A)(i)–(iii). \n99.  Discrimination includes “a failure to take such steps as may be necessary to \nensure that no individual with a disability is excluded, denied services, segregated or otherwise \ntreated differently than other individuals because of the absence of auxiliary aids and services.”  \n42 U.S.C. § 12182(b)(2)(A)(iii). \n100.  Auxiliary aids and services include, among other things, “open and closed \ncaptioning, including real-time captioning; . . . or other effective methods of making aurally \ndelivered information available to individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing.” 28 C.F.R. § \n36.303(b).  \n101.  Defendants’ podcast streaming services are each places of public accommodation \nas defined by the ADA because they are, or are part of, a “place of exhibition or entertainment,” \n  -25-   \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-10542   Document 1   Filed 12/09/21   Page 26 of 36\na “sales or rental establishment,” a “service establishment,” a “library,” a “gallery,” and/or a \n“place of public display or collection.”  42 U.S.C. § 12181(7); 28 C.F.R. § 36.104. \n102.  Defendant SiriusXM owns, operates, maintains, and/or leases the podcast \nstreaming service which can be accessed at https://www.siriusxm.com/. Defendant Stitcher \nowns, operates, maintains, and/or leases the podcast streaming service which can be accessed at \nhttps://www.stitcher.com/. Defendant Pandora owns, operates, maintains, and/or leases the \npodcast streaming service which can be accessed at https://www.pandora.com/. Each \nDefendants, also owns, operates, maintains, and/or leases mobile applications for Apple and \nAndroid devices where they each offer their podcast-streaming service. These websites and \nmobile applications are services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations of \nDefendants. \n103.  Plaintiffs Rebecca Alexander, Jazmine Jones, Dr. Amber Martin, James Munro, \nand Mei Nishimoto are individuals with a disability who are substantially limited in the major \nlife activity of hearing. \n104.  Plaintiff NAD is a nonprofit advocacy organization that has associational standing \non the basis that its members are individuals with a disability who are substantially limited in the \nmajor life activity of hearing. \n105.  Because each Defendant refuses to provide transcripts for their podcast streaming \ncontent on its platform, Plaintiffs and other members of the NAD are excluded from enjoyment \nof the services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations Defendants offers to their \nhearing customers. \n  -26-   \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-10542   Document 1   Filed 12/09/21   Page 27 of 36\n106.  SiriusXM’s failure to provide transcripts for its podcasts violates Title III’s \ngeneral prohibition of discrimination and the specific requirement that public accommodations \nprovide auxiliary aids and services. 42 U.S.C. § 12182(a), (b)(2)(A)(iii). \n107.  Stitcher’s failure to provide transcripts for its podcasts violates Title III’s general \nprohibition of discrimination and the specific requirement that public accommodations provide \nauxiliary aids and services. Id. \n108.  Pandora’s failure to provide transcripts for its podcasts violates Title III’s general \nprohibition of discrimination and the specific requirement that public accommodations provide \nauxiliary aids and services. Id. \n109.  As a result of each Defendant’s failure to ensure that their websites and software \napplications are accessible to individuals who are deaf and hard of hearing, Plaintiffs, as well as \nindividual members of NAD, are denied participation to each Defendant’s podcast services \nand/or are provided an opportunity to participate in or benefit from a good, service, facility, \nprivilege, advantage, or accommodation that is not equal to that which each Defendant affords \nhearing individuals.  \n110.  SiriusXM’s podcast streaming service is not accessible to people who require \ntranscripts, in violation of the ADA’s prohibition of discrimination. 42 U.S.C. § 12182(a), \n(b)(1)(A)(i)–(ii). \n111.  Stitcher’s podcast streaming service is not accessible to people who require \ntranscripts, in violation of the ADA’s prohibition of discrimination. Id. \n112.  Pandora’s podcast streaming service is not accessible to people who require \ntranscripts, in violation of the ADA’s prohibition of discrimination. Id. \n  -27-   \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-10542   Document 1   Filed 12/09/21   Page 28 of 36\n113.  An actual controversy has arisen and now exists between the parties in that \nPlaintiffs contend, and are informed and believe that by refusing to provide captions or \ntranscripts for the podcasts available in its library, each Defendant fails to comply with \napplicable laws, including but not limited to Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 \nU.S.C. § 12181 et seq. \n114.  Unless the Court enjoins Defendants from continuing to engage in these unlawful \npractices, Plaintiffs will continue to suffer irreparable harm. \n115.  As a result of Defendants’ wrongful conduct, Plaintiffs are entitled to injunctive \nrelief pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 12188 requiring Defendants to remedy the discrimination. \n116.  Plaintiffs are also entitled to reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs. \nSECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nVIOLATION OF THE NEW YORK CITY HUMAN RIGHTS LAW \n(N.Y.C. ADMIN. CODE § 8-101 ET SEQ.) \n \n117.  Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate herein all previously alleged paragraphs of this \nComplaint. \n118.  The NYCHRL has a “uniquely remedial” purpose. The construction provision of \nthis law expressly provides that each section must be “construed liberally for the \naccomplishment of the uniquely broad and remedial purposes thereof, regardless of whether \nfederal or New York State civil and human rights laws, including those laws with provisions \nworded comparably to provisions of this title, have been so construed.” N.Y.C. Admin. Code § \n8-130. \n119.  Accordingly, Defendants’ conduct is subject to a much stricter standard under the \nNYCHRL than under federal law, and Defendants’ liability under these provisions must be \n  -28-   \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-10542   Document 1   Filed 12/09/21   Page 29 of 36\ndetermined separately and independently from their liability under the disability provisions of \nother statutes alleged in this Complaint. \n120.  N.Y.C. Admin. Code § 8-107(4)(a) provides that “[i]t shall be an unlawful \ndiscriminatory practice for any person who is the owner, franchisor, franchisee, lessor, lessee, \nproprietor, manager, superintendent, agent or employee of any place or provider of public \naccommodation . . . [b]ecause of any person’s actual or perceived . . . disability . . . directly or \nindirectly . . . [t]o refuse, withhold from or deny to such person the full and equal enjoyment, on \nequal terms and conditions, of any of the accommodations, advantages, services, facilities or \nprivileges of the place or provider of public accommodation.” Persons include all “natural \npersons, proprietorships, partnerships, associations, group associations, organizations, \ngovernmental bodies or agencies, corporations, [and] legal representatives.” See N.Y.C. Admin. \nCode § 8-102. \n121.  SiriusXM’s podcast streaming service is a place of public accommodation within \nthe definition of N.Y.C. Administrative Code § 8-102(9). \n122.  Stitcher’s podcast streaming service is a place of public accommodation within \nthe definition of N.Y.C. Administrative Code § 8-102(9). \n123.  Pandora’s podcast streaming service is a place of public accommodation within \nthe definition of N.Y.C. Administrative Code § 8-102(9). \n124.  All Defendants are persons within the meaning of N.Y.C. Administrative Code § \n8-102(1) which defines “persons” to include “corporations.”   \n125.  SiriusXM has its principal headquarters in New York City, it makes its services \navailable throughout New York City, and some of the Plaintiffs are located within New York \nCity. \n  -29-   \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-10542   Document 1   Filed 12/09/21   Page 30 of 36\n126.  Stitcher has its principal headquarters in New York City, it makes its services \navailable throughout New York City, and some of the Plaintiffs are located within New York \nCity. \n127.  Pandora makes its services available throughout New York City, and some of the \nPlaintiffs are located within New York City. \n128.  Plaintiffs Rebecca Alexander, Jazmine Jones, Dr. Amber Martin, James Munro, \nand Mei Nishimoto are individuals with a disability within the definition of N.Y.C. \nAdministrative Code § 8-102. Plaintiff NAD’s membership includes individuals with a disability \nwithin the definition of N.Y.C. Administrative Code § 8-102 who live and/or work in New York \nCity.  \n129.  Plaintiff Rebecca Alexander lives and works in New York City, and would \nconsume Defendants’ accommodations, advantages, services, facilities or privileges there, if they \nwere accessible to her. \n130.  SiriusXM violates N.Y.C. Administrative Code § 8-107(4)(a) by denying persons \nwho are deaf and hard of hearing access to its podcast services which are otherwise available to \nthe general public. \n131.  Stitcher violates N.Y.C. Administrative Code § 8-107(4)(a) by denying persons \nwho are deaf and hard of hearing access to its podcast services which are otherwise available to \nthe general public. \n132.  Pandora violates N.Y.C. Administrative Code § 8-107(4)(a) by denying persons \nwho are deaf and hard of hearing access to its podcast services which are otherwise available to \nthe general public. \n  -30-   \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-10542   Document 1   Filed 12/09/21   Page 31 of 36\n133.  Each Defendant also violates N.Y.C. Admin. Code § 8-107(15). This provision \nmandates that “it is an unlawful discriminatory practice for any person prohibited by the \nprovisions of this section from discriminating on the basis of disability not to provide a \nreasonable accommodation to enable a person with a disability to . . . enjoy the right or rights in \nquestion provided that the disability is known or should have been known by the covered entity.” \nSee NY.C. Admin. Code § 8-107(15). Because this provision applies to all entities that must \ncomply with N.Y.C. Admin Code § 8-107, each Defendant is bound by it, and each has \nunlawfully denied Plaintiffs the reasonable accommodation of transcripts for the podcasts in its \nlibrary.  \n134.  As a direct and proximate result of SiriusXM’s violations of the NYCHRL, \nPlaintiffs have been injured as set forth herein. \n135.  As a direct and proximate result of Stitcher’s violations of the NYCHRL, \nPlaintiffs have been injured as set forth herein. \n136.  As a direct and proximate result of Pandora’s violations of the NYCHRL, \nPlaintiffs have been injured as set forth herein. \n137.  Defendants’ conduct constitutes an ongoing and continuous violation of the \nNYCHRL. Unless Defendants are enjoined from further violations, Plaintiffs will continue to \nsuffer injuries for which there is no adequate remedy at law. In particular, Plaintiffs will suffer \nirreparable harm in that they will continue to be discriminatorily excluded from accessing \nDefendants’ podcast libraries on equal terms with everyone else. Plaintiffs are accordingly \nentitled to injunctive relief, compensatory damages, as well as civil penalties and fines pursuant \nto N.Y.C. Administrative Code § 8-120, and reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs. \n138.  WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs pray for relief as set forth below. \n  -31-   \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-10542   Document 1   Filed 12/09/21   Page 32 of 36\nTHIRD CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n(Violation of New York State Human Rights Law, N.Y. Exec. Law, \nArticle 15 (Executive Law § 292 et seq.)) \n \n139.  Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate herein all previously alleged paragraphs of this \nComplaint. \n140.  New York Executive Law § 296(2)(a) states that it is an “an unlawful \ndiscriminatory practice for any person, being the owner, lessee, proprietor, manager, \nsuperintendent, agent or employee of any place of public accommodation . . . because of the . . . \ndisability . . . of any person, directly or indirectly, to refuse, withhold from or deny to such \nperson any of the accommodations, advantages, facilities or privileges thereof.” \n141.  New York Executive Law § 296(2)(c)(i) defines unlawful discriminatory \npractices as including “a refusal to make reasonable modifications in policies, practices, or \nprocedures, when such modifications are necessary to afford facilities, privileges, advantages or \naccommodations to individuals with disabilities.” \n142.  New York Executive Law § 296(2)(c)(ii) further provides that an unlawful \ndiscriminatory practice shall also include “a refusal to take such steps as may be necessary to \nensure that no individual with a disability is excluded or denied services because of the absence \nof auxiliary aids and services.”  \n143.  Each Defendant operates a place of public accommodation under  N.Y. Exec. \nLaw § 292(9) which defines “place of public accommodation” broadly to include \n“establishments dealing with goods or services of any kind.”  \n144.  SiriusXM has its principal headquarters in New York State, it makes its services \navailable throughout New York State, and some of the Plaintiffs are located within New York \nState. \n  -32-   \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-10542   Document 1   Filed 12/09/21   Page 33 of 36\n145.

Exec. Law § 296(2) et seq. and/or its implementing regulations.  \n150.  SiriusXM’s failure to provide and integrate transcripts into its mobile application \nand website unlawfully denies Plaintiffs reasonable modifications and auxiliary aids and services \nwhich are necessary so that they may enjoy the advantages and accommodations of SiriusXM’s \nservices. See New York Exec. Law § 296(2)(c)(i)–(ii).  \n151.  Stitcher’s failure to provide and integrate transcripts into its mobile application \nand website unlawfully denies Plaintiffs reasonable modifications and auxiliary aids and services \n  -33-   \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-10542   Document 1   Filed 12/09/21   Page 34 of 36\nwhich are necessary so that they may enjoy the advantages and accommodations of Stitcher’s \nservices. See Id. \n152.  Pandora’s failure to provide and integrate transcripts into its mobile application \nand website unlawfully denies Plaintiffs reasonable modifications and auxiliary aids and services \nwhich are necessary so that they may enjoy the advantages and accommodations of Pandora’s \nservices.
