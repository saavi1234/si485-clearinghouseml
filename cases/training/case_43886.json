After extensive briefing and oral argument, we hold that the district court's stay order should be VACATED in part and AFFIRMED in part. We conclude that the Medical Organizations and Doctors' claim as to the 2000 Approval is likely barred by the statute of limitations. Accordingly, that component of the district court's order must be VACATED. This means that, until final judgment, Mifeprex will remain available to the public under the conditions for use that existed in 2016. We also VACATE the portion of the order relating to the 2019 Generic Approval because the Medical Organizations and Doctors have not shown that they are injured by that particular action. The generic version of mifepristone will also be available under the same conditions as Mifeprex. We AFFIRM the components of the stay order that concern the 2016 Amendments and the 2021 Non-Enforcement Decision. Those agency actions which generally loosen the protections and regulations relating to the use of mifepristone will be stayed during the pendency of this litigation. Finally, we note that our holding is subject to the prior order of the Supreme Court, which stayed the district court's order pending resolution of this appeal and disposition of any petition for writ of certiorari.

    "summary": "<p>On November 18, 2022, four national medical associations and four doctors with alleged experience in caring for pregnant and post-abortive patients sued the United States Food &amp; Drug Administration (FDA), seeking to overturn the agency&rsquo;s decades-old authorization of mifepristone, a pill that induces abortions. Represented by Alliance Defending Freedom and a private law firm, Plaintiffs brought suit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas. Plaintiffs brought suit under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), arguing that the FDA's approval and subsequent regulation of medication abortion was in excess of the agency's jurisdiction as well as arbitrary and capricious. Plaintiffs sought injunctive and declaratory relief in addition to attorneys' fees. In particular, Plaintiffs requested that the Court order Defendants to withdraw mifepristone as an FDA-approved chemical abortion drug. The case was assigned to Judge Matthew Joseph Kacsmaryk.</p>\r\n<p>The day the case was filed, Plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction. Several amicus briefs were submitted on both sides, including briefs by members of Congress and states. On January 13, 2023, Danco Laboratories - the holder of the FDA new drug application approval for mifepristone - moved to intervene as a defendant. On February 6, 2023, the Court granted the motion. Briefing by the parties was completed on February 24, 2023, and on March 15, the Court held a hearing on the matter.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On April 7, 2023, Judge Kacsmaryk granted the Plaintiffs' motion in part. First resolving all procedural issues, he concluded that the medical association plaintiffs had associational and organizational standing and that they alleged concrete and redressable injuries in the form of \"intense side effects and significant complications for their patients requiring medical intervention and attention.\" The Court also determined that the claims were reviewable, because even though FDA approved mifepristone in 2000, it \"reopened\" its decision in 2016 and 2021 by changing the mifepristone regulatory scheme. Because the Court held that the agency's decisions were not committed to agency discretion and the Plaintiffs' failure to exhaust certain claims was excusable, the Court had jurisdiction.</p>\r\n<p>Turning to the merits, the Court held, in the April 7, 2023 decision, that the Plaintiffs' challenges had a substantial likelihood of success, that there was a substantial threat of irreparable harm, and that preliminary relief would serve the public interest. On the first prong of analysis, Judge Kacsmaryk held that the FDA's actions likely violated the Comstock Act, which prohibits the mailing of articles, instruments, substances, drugs, and medicines for abortion. He also held that the actions were likely arbitrary and capricious in violation of the APA, critiquing the FDA's approval process and subsequent regulatory changes.</p>\r\n<p>As for relief, Judge Kacsmaryk held that a stay under Section 705 of the APA would be more appropriate than ordering withdrawal or suspension of FDA's approval. He therefore stayed the effective date of FDA's approval of mifepristone and all subsequent challenged actions relating to that approval. Included in his decision was a stay of seven days to allow the federal government to seek emergency relief from the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. Within hours of the decision being publicized, the FDA did indeed file an appeal with the Fifth Circuit as did Danco.</p>\r\n<p>On the same day that Judge Kacsmaryk issued his decision, a District Court judge in Washington issued a decision in&nbsp;<a href=\"../../../../case/44043/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Washington v. FDA</em></a>, preliminarily enjoining the FDA from altering the status quo and rights as it related to the availability of mifepristone under the current operative regulatory scheme in the seventeen plaintiff states plus the District of Columbia.</p>\r\n<p>On April 12, 2023, the Fifth Circuit granted in part the defendants' motion for a stay pending appeal. The three-judge panel all agreed that the federal statute of limitations likely barred Judge Kacsmaryk&rsquo;s ruling regarding the FDA&rsquo;s original 2000 approval of mifepristone. Two of the judges went on to subsequently deny the motion to stay with respect to the rest of the lower ruling. In effect, this meant that mifepristone was still approved as it was in 2000, but with outdated restrictions and requirements that would substantially limit access. Importantly, the Fifth Circuit's holding endorsed the District Court's conclusions that the plaintiffs had standing and that the defendants were not irreparably harmed by the order. The Fifth Circuit also expedited the appeal to the next available oral argument calendar.</p>\r\n<p>Two days after the Fifth Circuit's decision, on April 14, 2023, the Department of Justice and Danco both requested emergency relief from the Supreme Court of the United States, asking for a stay of the preliminary injunction pending appeal. Without emergency relief, the Fifth Circuit's order would have gone into effect that day at midnight. On April 14, Justice Alito announced that the order was administratively stayed until 11:59pm EDT on April 19, 2023, presumably to give the Court time to consider the request. On April 19, the Court extended the administrative stay for two more days.</p>\r\n<p>On April 21, 2023, the United States Supreme Court granted the applications for stays requested by the FDA and Danco. The Court stayed Judge Kacsmaryk's decision pending disposition of the appeal in the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit and disposition of a petition for a writ of certiorari, if such a writ is timely sought. Justice Thomas noted that he would have denied the applications, and Justice Alito authored a dissent.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Litigation in the district court was stayed until the resolution of all appellate avenues concerning the April 7, 2023 order. The Fifth Circuit heard oral argument for May 17, 2023, and on August 16, the Fifth Circuit released its decision. It concluded that given the statute of limitations, the plaintiffs were unlikely to succeed on their challenge of the drug's original approval. The court also found that there was no evidence tending to show that the FDA's approval of the generic version of the drug contributed to the risk of harm. However, the court held that FDA's 2016 Amendments to the restrictions on the drug and the FDA's subsequent decision to allow the drug to be dispensed via mail were likely arbitrary and capricious. Because of the Supreme Court's April stay, the Fifth Circuit's August decision did not immediately go into effect. If it were to go into effect, mifepristone would remain on the market, but with additional restrictions limiting access.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On September 8, 2023, both FDA and Danco filed petitions for a writ of certiorari with the United States Supreme Court. On December 13, 2023, the Supreme Court granted cert in both cases, consolidating the oral argument. The Supreme Court heard oral argument on March 26, 2024.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The Supreme Court held 9-0 that plaintiffs lacked standing to challenge the FDA's actions on June 13, 2024. In an opinion delivered by Justice Kavanaugh, the Court held that plaintiffs failed to demonstrate that FDA's relaxed regulatory requirements would cause them an injury for Article III standing purposes. The required causal chain for standing was broken because the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA) guidance offered by FDA and challenged by plaintiffs did not override federal conscience laws or require individual physicians to participate in emergency abortions. Plaintiffs' alleged downstream economic injuries (diversion of resources and time from other patients to treat patients with mifepristone complications; potentially increasing insurance costs; etc.) were too speculative. Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine's organizational standing argument also failed muster because intensity of interest in an issue was insufficient for an organization to claim standing. Therefore, federal courts were an improper forum for plaintiffs' concerns. Plaintiffs final argument for standing, that if they did not have standing, no one would have standing to challenge the FDA's 2016 and 2021 actions, also failed because the Court long recognized that some issues were left to political and democratic processes</p>\r\n<p>Justice Thomas wrote a concurrence to highlight his objection to third-party standing doctrine and organizational standing, or associational standing, which he argued was simply another form of third-party standing. Justice Thomas' issues with associational standing included that it overly relaxed the injury and redressability requirements for standing.</p>\r\n<p>The next month, on October 11, Idaho, Kansas and Missouri filed a motion for leave to file an amended complaint. In the proposed amended complaint, the intervenor states, suing under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), argued that the FDA's approval and subsequent regulation of medication abortion was in excess of the agency's jurisdiction as well as arbitrary and capricious. The intervenors alleged they suffered several injuries, including interference with enforcement of state abortion laws, economic injuries to the states&rsquo; medical systems, and injuries to the states&rsquo; population interests.</p>\r\n<p>The amended complaint does not challenge the drug&rsquo;s original approval, nor does it call for the FDA to vacate its original approval or declare that mifepristone and misoprostol fall outside the scope of the FDA&rsquo;s regulation, as the original complaint did. The amended complaint asks the Court to reinstate the drug&rsquo;s 2016 risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS), rescind the 2019 generic approval and reinstate the in-person dispensing requirement. It also asks the Court to hold unlawful &ldquo;the provision of drugs to adolescent populations because the FDA lacked authority under &sect; 355c(a)(2)(B)(i) to extrapolate pediatric effectiveness,&rdquo; another change from the original complaint.</p>\r\n<p>The intervenors sought declaratory and injunctive relief, including the reinstatement of the drug's 2016 REMS, rescinding the 2019 generic approval, reinstating the in-person dispensing requirement, and holding unlawful the provision of the drug to \"adolescent populations.\"&nbsp; Unlike the original complaint, the amended complaint did not challenge mifepristone's original approve or argue that mifepristone and misoprostol fall outside the scope of FDA's regulation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On November 1, defendants filed a motion to dismiss, requesting that both plaintiff and the intervenor states&rsquo; complaints be dismissed or, in the alternative, that plaintiffs&rsquo; complaint be dismissed and intervenor states&rsquo; complaint be transferred to a district where venue would be proper. The same day, Danco Laboratories filed a motion to dismiss plaintiffs&rsquo; complaint and the intervenor states&rsquo; complaint.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On November 19, Plaintiffs &ndash; the four national medical associations and four doctors who filed the original complaint &ndash; filed a notice of voluntary dismissal without prejudice. Plaintiffs did not explain their decision to dismiss. After that date, the only remaining plaintiffs were the state intervenors, and the case caption changed to Missouri et al. v. FDA.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On January 16, 2025, Judge Kacsmaryk also granted Intervenor Plaintiffs&rsquo; motion to file an amended complaint, which was subsequently filed. The amended complaint added additional factual support to Intervenor Plaintiffs&rsquo; arguments, including additional information about the FDA&rsquo;s approval of GenBioPro, Inc.&rsquo;s (&ldquo;GenBioPro&rdquo;) abortion medications. In the same order, Judge Kacsmaryk denied as moot both motions to dismiss, as the motions challenged the original complaint.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Defendants filed a motion to dismiss on January 18, and Danco Laboratories filed its own motion to dismiss on January 28.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On February 25, GenBioPro, the manufacturer of generic mifepristone, filed a motion to intervene as a defendant. It also filed a propose motion to dismiss and joinder to the two pending motions to dismiss the amended complaint.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>As of April 24, 2025, the case is ongoing.&nbsp;</p>",

On June 13, 2024, the Supreme Court ruled unanimously in favor of the FDA, finding that the plaintiffs lacked standing. The case was remanded to the lower court. On October 11, Idaho, Kansas and Missouri filed a motion for leave to file an amended complaint. On November 19, the private plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed their case, leaving only the intervenor plaintiffs. The intervenor plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on January 16, 2025. Defendants filed motions to dismiss the amended complaint, and GenBioPro, the manufacturer of generic mifepristone, filed a motion to intervene and a motion to dismiss on February 25. \r\nAs of April 24, 2025, the case is ongoing.",

Women face severe, even life-threatening, harm because the federal \ngovernment has disregarded their health and safety. \n2.  Defendant U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has the statutory \nresponsibility to protect the health, safety, and welfare of all Americans by putting \ncommonsense safeguards on high-risk drugs. \n1 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 195-1   Filed 10/11/24    Page 2 of 199   PageID 9299\n3.  But the FDA has failed in this responsibility by removing many of the \nsafety standards it once provided to women using abortion drugs.  \n4.  Abortion  drugs  are  dangerous—the  FDA’s  own  label  says  that  an \nestimated roughly one in 25 women who take abortion drugs will visit the emergency \nroom.  \n5.  But  the  FDA  has  enabled  online  abortion  providers  to  mail  FDA-\napproved  abortion  drugs  to  women  in  states  that  regulate abortion—dispensing \nabortion drugs with no doctor care, no exam, and no in-person follow-up care. These \ndangerous drugs are now flooding states like Missouri and Idaho and sending women \nin these States to the emergency room.  \n       \nWomen prepare in-home abortion kits at a ‘pill-packing party’ at the MAP’s offices; \nPatient  packages  include  two  abortion  medications,  instructions  and  additional \ninformation.1 \n6.  Women face severe bleeding, ruptured ectopic pregnancies, and life-\nthreatening  infections  because  the  FDA  recklessly  removed  in-person  safety \nstandards that it once provided. \n7.  Women should have the in-person care of a doctor when taking high-risk \ndrugs. The States of Missouri, Kansas, and Idaho thus challenge the FDA’s actions \n                                            \n1 Ex. 1, Scott Calvert, The Parties Where Volunteers Pack Abortion Pills for Red-State \nWomen, Wall Street Journal (Aug. 12, 2024), https://www.wsj.com/us-news/abortion-\npill-parties-shipping-148e3c15.  \n2 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 195-1   Filed 10/11/24    Page 3 of 199   PageID 9300\nto remove commonsense safety measures for abortion drugs and ask that the Court \nhold these actions unlawful, stay their effective date, set them aside, and vacate \nthem.  \n8.  In rolling back safeguard after safeguard, the FDA has turned a blind \neye to the known harms of abortion drugs to the detriment of women and girls.  \n9.  The FDA has taken the following agency actions that harm women and \ngirls: (1) the 2016 rollback of most of the safety precautions that the FDA had put in \nplace when it approved mifepristone in 2000, including three in-person doctor visits \nand limits to ensure these drugs were not taken later in pregnancy; (2) the 2019 \napproval of a single, shared system Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) \nfor  the  brand  and  generic  versions  of  mifepristone;  and  (3)  the  2021  and  2023 \ndecisions  to  allow  these  drugs  to  be  sent  by  mail  and  dispensed  online  or  at \npharmacies. \n10.  In March 2016, the FDA made “interrelated,” “major changes” to the \nabortion drug regimen but failed to explain why it was unnecessary to consider any \nstudy that evaluated the cumulative effects of the changes as a whole. \n11.  Major  changes  that  occurred  in  2016  included  (1)  extending  the \npermissible gestational age of the baby from seven weeks to ten weeks; (2) reducing \nthe number of required in-person office visits from three to one; and (3) expanding \nwho could prescribe and administer abortion drugs beyond medical doctors.  \n12.  Each of these regimen changes carries its own risks. And combining \nthem only increases those risks. For example, numerous studies show that there are \nincreased risks from abortion drugs to pregnant women as the baby’s age advances \nfrom seven to ten weeks, due in part to significant growth of the placenta and the \nbaby during that period. The risks of harm to women are also exacerbated without \nfollow-up visits, during which a doctor can assess whether a mother is suffering \ncomplications from the older gestational age of her baby. \n3 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 195-1   Filed 10/11/24    Page 4 of 199   PageID 9301\n13.  But  despite  the  FDA  itself  characterizing  these  changes  as \n“interrelated,” the FDA made them without any studies that evaluated the impact of \nremoving all of these interrelated safeguards at once.  \n14.  On  top  of  removing these  safeguards,  the  FDA also  eliminated  the \nsafeguard under which abortion providers must report non-fatal complications. But \nthis elimination was based on past data collected under the originally approved safety \nstandards, not the new deregulated regime. This was unreasonable. \n15.  In 2016, the agency also ignored the potential impacts that the removal \nof  commonsense  safeguards  would  have  on  adolescent  girls,  a  violation  of  the \nPediatric Research and Equity Act (PREA). It improperly relied on extrapolation in \nlieu  of  any  safety  assessment  of  the  new  regimen’s  safety  and  effectiveness  on \npediatric populations. And the FDA needed to classify pregnancy as a “disease” to \navoid such a safety assessment. But pregnancy is not a disease. \n16.  In addition, the studies on which the FDA did rely included safety \nmeasures like ultrasound screenings and follow-up visits that were stripped from the \nnew regimen. \n17.  The  FDA’s  major  changes  failed  to  satisfy  the  rigorous  scientific \nstandards of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) and violated PREA’s \nrequirement for a specific safety assessment of these changes on pregnant girls who \nundergo the revised regime. \n18.  In 2019, several organizations filed a citizen petition challenging the \n2016 changes and asserting that the agency violated the law by ignoring the growing \nand substantial evidence that these high-risk drugs harm women. All. for Hippocratic \nMed. v. U.S. Food & Drug Admin., 78 F.4th 210, 226 (5th Cir. 2023), rev’d, 602 U.S. \n367 (2024) (AHM).  \n19.  One month later, the FDA approved a generic version of Mifeprex based \non the flawed and unlawful 2016 Major Changes. \n4 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 195-1   Filed 10/11/24    Page 5 of 199   PageID 9302\n20.  When the FDA approved generic mifepristone, it also approved a single, \nshared  system  risk  evaluation and  mitigation  strategy  (REMS)  for  mifepristone \nproducts for “the medical termination of intrauterine pregnancy” through 70 days \n(known as the “Mifepristone REMS Program”). \n21.  In April 2021, the FDA, under new management installed by the Biden-\nHarris Administration, issued a “Non-Enforcement Decision” under which the agency \nwould not enforce the in-person dispensing protection but instead would temporarily \nallow abortion drugs to be shipped by mail during the COVID-19 public health \nemergency despite a statute expressly disallowing that conduct. 18 U.S.C. § 1461.  \n22.  In December 2021, the FDA rejected almost all the relief sought in the \ncitizen petition and, on the same day, the Biden-Harris FDA announced that it would \npermanently allow abortion providers to send abortion drugs through the mail, in \nblatant violation of statutory law. 18 U.S.C. § 1461. \n23.  And in 2023, the FDA formalized its 2021 removal of the in-person \ndispensing  protection  and  expanded  the  program  to  allow  mifepristone  to  be \ndispensed by retail pharmacies. The agency relied on the same basis for its 2021 \ndecision, adding only that it had not observed a significant difference in adverse event \nreporting during the COVID-19 public health emergency. \n24.  The FDA’s decision to eliminate the in-person dispensing protection \nfailed to account for or address the federal laws that prohibit the distribution of \nabortion drugs by postal mail, express company, or common carrier and by interactive \ncomputer service. See 18 U.S.C. §§ 1461, 1462. Instead, through its words and actions \nFDA permitted and sometimes even encouraged these illegal activities. But a federal \nagency cannot authorize unlawful actions. FCC v. Next Wave Pers. Commc’ns Inc., \n537 U.S. 293, 300 (2003) (“The Administrative Procedure Act requires federal courts \nto set aside federal agency action that is ‘not in accordance with law,’ 5 U.S.C. \n5 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 195-1   Filed 10/11/24    Page 6 of 199   PageID 9303\n§ 706(2)(A)—which means, of course, any law, and not merely those laws that the \nagency itself is charged with administering.”) (citation omitted). \n25.  The FDA has consistently identified emergency medical care—including \nState emergency medical care—as the backstop for abortion drug complications. Its \ncurrent label directs women to emergency rooms if one of many adverse complications \narise. \n26.  The FDA has acted unlawfully. Now, the State Plaintiffs ask the Court \nto protect women by holding unlawful, staying the effective date of, setting aside, and \nvacating the FDA’s actions to eviscerate crucial safeguards for those who undergo \nthis dangerous drug regimen. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n27.

This action challenges the FDA’s failure to abide by its legal obligations \nto  protect  the  health,  safety,  and  welfare  of  women  and  girls  and  comply  with \nstatutory  law  when  eliminating  necessary  safeguards  for  pregnant  women  who \nundergo the high-risk abortion drug regimen of mifepristone and misoprostol.  \n51.  The FDA no longer even requires an in-person visit to protect women’s \nhealth and well-being when taking abortion drugs.  \n9 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 195-1   Filed 10/11/24    Page 10 of 199   PageID 9307\n52.  Abortion drugs are high-risk. Endocrine disrupters such as mifepristone \ncould  have  significant  impacts  on  an  adolescent  girl’s  developing  body  and \nreproductive system. Despite this fact, the FDA failed to require an assessment that \nevaluated the safety of the 2016 Major Changes on pregnant girls under 18 years of \nage. \n53.  The FDA has also eliminated the few safeguards it initially established \nto protect women who receive mifepristone. \n54.  In 2016, the FDA made changes (1) allowing pregnant women and girls \nto take the drug at up to 70 days’ gestation rather than only 49 days’ gestation; (2) \nallowing  non-doctors  to  prescribe  and  administer  chemical  abortions;  and  (3) \neliminating  crucial  in-person  follow-up  office  visits  to  check  women  for  life-\nthreatening complications after taking high-risk abortion drugs.  \n55.  The agency also eliminated the safeguard under which prescribers must \nreport nonfatal adverse events from chemical abortion based on past data collected \nwhen original standards were still in place. This last change meant that the FDA and \nthe public would never learn how many more happened due to the removal of the \nprior safeguards.  \n56.  These changes were not only “major” but “interrelated.”2 Yet the FDA \nnever  explained  why  no  study  it  relied  on  to  make  the  changes  assessed  their \ncollective impact on the safety and effectiveness of the drug. \n57.  Then,  in  2021,  the  FDA  announced  that  abortion  providers  could \ndispense  abortion  drugs  by  mail  or  mail-order  pharmacy,  despite  longstanding \nfederal law prohibiting mailing abortion drugs.  \n                                            \n2  Ex.  2,  FDA,  Center  for  Drug  Evaluation  and  Research,  Summary  Review  of \nApplication Number: 020687Orig1s020 (Mar. 29, 2016) (2016 Summary Review). \n10 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 195-1   Filed 10/11/24    Page 11 of 199   PageID 9308\n58.  In  2023,  the  FDA  formalized  its  decision  to  remove  any  in-person \ndispensing protection and to permit abortion providers to prescribe abortion drugs \nwithout an initial office visit or confirming that a woman does not have a life-\nthreatening complication, such as an ectopic pregnancy, that would preclude her from \ntaking abortion drugs. \n59.  The FDA relied on the same basis for its 2023 decision as its 2021 \ndecision but added that “[t]he number of adverse events reported to FDA during the \nCOVID-19 PHE with mifepristone use for medical termination of pregnancy is small, \nand the data provide no indication that any program deviation or noncompliance with \nthe Mifepristone REMS Program contributed to these reported adverse events.”3 It \nalso noted that the format of the REMS document would not be changed “[t]o avoid \nthe misperception that this REMS modification is making major changes to the \nREMS document that go beyond our December 16, 2021, determination that the \nREMS must be modified to remove the in-person dispensing protection and add \npharmacy  certification,”  and  that  the  “[c]hanges  are  in  line  with  the  REMS \nModification Notification letters sent December 16, 2021.”4 \nII. The Harms of Abortion Drugs  \n60.  A chemical abortion requires administering two drugs: (1) mifepristone \n(also called “Mifeprex” and “RU-486”) and (2) misoprostol.  \n61.  Mifepristone is a synthetic steroid and endocrine disruptor that blocks \nprogesterone  receptors  in  the  uterus.  Progesterone  is  necessary  for  the  healthy \ngrowth of a baby in utero and the maintenance of a pregnancy. When a woman ingests \nmifepristone,  it  blocks  her  natural  progesterone,  chemically  destroys  the  baby’s \n                                            \n3 Ex. 3, FDA, Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, Mifepristone Summary \nReview, dated Jan. 3, 2023 at 21 (FDA 2023 Summary Review). \n4 Id. at 8–9, 16. \n11 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 195-1   Filed 10/11/24    Page 12 of 199   PageID 9309\nuterine environment, prevents the baby from receiving nutrition, and ultimately \nstarves the baby to death in the womb. \n62.  The second drug, misoprostol, induces cramping and contractions to \nexpel the baby from the mother’s womb. \n63.  Women who take abortion drugs experience many intense side effects, \nincluding cramping and heavy bleeding.5 \n64.  The use of these two drugs can cause significant injuries and harms to \npregnant women, and studies of the real-world use of mifepristone concluded that \nsignificant morbidity and mortality have occurred following the use of mifepristone \nas an abortifacient.6  \n65.  For example, the FDA’s own label states that roughly one in 25 women \nwho take abortion drugs will end up in the emergency room, with up to 7 percent \nrequiring a “surgical procedure because the pregnancy did not completely pass from \nthe uterus or to stop bleeding.”7  \n66.  Of those women who end up in the emergency room after taking abortion \ndrugs, many suffer severe injuries. A recent study testing the severity of emergency \ndepartment visits for Medicaid-eligible women following various pregnancy outcomes \nfound  that  “an  [emergency  department]  visit  following  a  chemical abortion  was \nsignificantly more likely to have a severe or critical acuity rating than a visit following \nsurgical abortion, live birth, or an ED visit at any time by a woman who was never \n                                            \n5 Ex. 4, Harrison Compl.

Many women also do not understand the nature of chemical abortion or \nthe risks associated with taking abortion drugs, resulting in an increase in the \nfrequency  of  women  seeking  emergency  medical  care  for  side  effects  such  as \ncramping, heavy bleeding, and severe pain even if they are not suffering an adverse \nevent.10 \n68.  The complications of abortion drugs increase as the baby’s gestational \nage increases. One study found that, after nine weeks’ gestation, almost four times \nas many women and girls experience an incomplete abortion, nearly twice as many \nsuffer an infection, and over six times as many women and girls require surgical \nabortion after consuming the abortion drugs than at before nine weeks gestation.11 \nThe FDA’s own label notes that the percentage of surgical interventions for ongoing \npregnancy is just over ten times higher for women at 64–70 days gestation than for \nwomen at less than or equal to 49 days gestation.12 \n                                            \n8  James  Studnicki  et  al.,  Comparative  Acuity  of  Emergency  Department  Visits \nFollowing Pregnancy Outcomes Among Medicaid Eligible Women, 2004-2015, Int’l J. \nEpidemiology & Pub.

Abortion drugs present heightened risks for women with an Rh-negative \nblood type. If these women are not administered Rhogam at the time of their chemical \nabortion, they may experience isoimmunization, which threatens their ability to have \nfuture successful pregnancies. If an Rh-negative woman is left untreated, her future \nbaby will have a fourteen percent (14%) chance of being stillborn and a fifty percent \n(50%) chance of suffering neonatal death or a brain injury. Around fifteen percent \n(15%) of the U.S. population has this blood type.15 \n                                            \n14  Endowment  for  Human  Development,  I  am  Pointing, \nhttps://www.ehd.org/gallery/424/I-am-Pointing%21.  \n15 See Ex. 9, Am.

Without any in-person examination, abortion providers can misdate the \ngestational  age  of  a  baby  or  fail  to  detect  an  ectopic  pregnancy,  with  serious \nconsequences. It is undisputed that an ultrasound is the most accurate method to \ndetermine gestational age and identify ectopic pregnancy.16 \n73.  Some abortion activists encourage women to lie to emergency room staff \nby saying they are having a miscarriage if they suffer complications requiring urgent \ncare.17 \n74.  The  risk  of  chemical  abortions  is  not  only  physical:  women  have \ndescribed that their chemical abortion experiences harmed their mental health and \nleft them feeling unprepared, silenced, regretful, or left with no other choice.18  \n75.  Some abortion providers exacerbate this mental health harm by failing \nto inform a woman what she will see when she self-administers abortion drugs at \nhome. For example, one woman was surprised and saddened to see that her aborted \n                                            \n16 Ex. 10, Am.

The  FDA’s  Authority  to  Review,  Approve,  or  Deny  New  Drug \nApplications \n76.  The FDA’s modification of a drug approval must comply with the FDCA, \nPREA, and the agency’s regulations. When taking regulatory action on new and \nexisting drugs, the FDA must also meet the requirements of other federal laws \nrestricting distribution.20 \nA.  New Drug Applications Under the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic \nAct. \n77.  Under  the  FDCA,  anyone  seeking  to  introduce  into  commerce  and \ndistribute a new drug in the United States must first obtain the FDA’s approval by \nfiling a new drug application (NDA). 21 U.S.C. § 355(a). \n78.  The NDA must contain extensive scientific data showing the safety and \neffectiveness of the drug. 21 U.S.C. § 355(d); 21 C.F.R. § 314.125. \n79.  The FDA must reject an application if the clinical investigations “do not \ninclude adequate tests by all methods reasonably applicable to show whether or not \n                                            \n19 Ex. 14, Caroline Kitchener, Covert network provides pills for thousands of abortions \nin  U.S.  post  Roe,  Wash.

The FDA must also reject an application if “the results of such tests show \nthat such drug is unsafe for use under such conditions or do not show that such drug \nis safe for use under such conditions.” 21 U.S.C. § 355(d); 21 C.F.R. § 314.125(b)(3). \n81.  The  FDA  must  refuse  an  application  if  the  FDA  “has  insufficient \ninformation to determine whether such drug is safe for use under such conditions.” \n21 U.S.C. § 355(d); 21 C.F.R. § 314.125(b)(4). \n82.  Finally,  the  FDA  must  deny  an  application  if  “there  is  a  lack  of \nsubstantial  evidence  that  the  [new]  drug  will  have  the  effect  it  purports  or  is \nrepresented  to  have  under  the  conditions  of  use  prescribed,  recommended,  or \nsuggested  in  the  proposed  labeling  thereof.”  21  U.S.C.  §  355(d);  21  C.F.R. \n§ 314.125(b)(5). \n83.  “Substantial evidence” is “evidence consisting of adequate and well-\ncontrolled investigations, including clinical investigations, by experts qualified by \nscientific training and experience to evaluate the effectiveness of the drug involved, \non the basis of which it could fairly and responsibly be concluded by such experts that \nthe drug will have the effect it purports or is represented to have under the conditions \nof use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the labeling or proposed labeling \nthereof.” 21 U.S.C. § 355(d). \n84.  If a sponsor of an approved drug subsequently seeks to change the \nlabeling,  market  a  new  dosage  or  strength  of  the  drug,  or  change  the  way  it \nmanufactures a drug, the company must submit a supplemental new drug application \n(sNDA) seeking the FDA’s approval of such changes. 21 U.S.C. § 355(b); 21 C.F.R. \n§§ 314.54, 314.70. \n85.  “All  procedures  and  actions  that  apply  to  an  application  under  [21 \nC.F.R.] § 314.50 also apply to supplements, except that the information required in \n18 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 195-1   Filed 10/11/24    Page 19 of 199   PageID 9316\nthe supplement is limited to that needed to support the change.” 21 C.F.R.§ 314.71(b); \nsee also 21 C.F.R. § 314.54(a) (“application need contain only that information needed \nto support the modification(s) of the listed drug”). \n86.  The sNDA must also show that the drug is safe and effective for “the \nconditions of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the proposed labeling.” \n21 U.S.C. § 355(d). \n87.  A generic drug manufacturer may submit an abbreviated new drug \napplication (ANDA) to introduce into commerce and to distribute a generic version of \nan approved drug. 21 U.S.C. § 355(j). \n88.  In the ANDA, the generic drug manufacturer must show, among other \nthings, that (a) the conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the \nlabeling proposed for the new drug have been previously approved for a drug listed \nand (b) the drug product is chemically identical to the approved drug, allowing it to \nrely  on  the  FDA’s  previous  finding  of  safety  and  effectiveness.  The  route  of \nadministration,  dosage  form,  and  strength  for  the  generic  also  identical  to  the \napproved drug. 21 U.S.C. § 355(j); 21 C.F.R. § 314.94. \nB.  Assessments on Pediatric Populations. \n89.  PREA  was  enacted  in  2003  to  require  studies  on  the  safety  and \neffectiveness of drugs intended for pediatric populations, unless certain exceptions \napply. The FDA may require an assessment on the drug’s safety and effectiveness, \nextrapolate findings from studies on adult populations, or waive the assessment for \npediatric populations. 21 U.S.C. § 355c. \n90.  In  general,  PREA requires  a  drug  application  or  supplement  to  an \napplication  to  include  a  safety  and  effectiveness  assessment  for  the  claimed \nindications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations. 21 U.S.C. § 355c(a)(2)(A)(i). This \n19 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 195-1   Filed 10/11/24    Page 20 of 199   PageID 9317\nassessment  must  also  support  dosing  and  administration  for  each  pediatric \nsubpopulation for which the drug is safe and effective. 21 U.S.C. § 355c(a)(2)(A)(ii). \n91.  Under  limited  circumstances,  PREA  allows  the  FDA  to  avoid  this \nassessment  and,  instead,  extrapolate  the  safety  and  effectiveness  of  a  drug  for \npediatric populations: “If the course of the disease and the effects of the drug are \nsufficiently similar in adults and pediatric patients, the [FDA] may conclude that \npediatric effectiveness can be extrapolated from adequate and well-controlled studies \nin  adults,  usually  supplemented  with  other  information  obtained  in  pediatric \npatients.” 21 U.S.C. § 355c(a)(2)(B)(i) (emphasis added). \n92.  But  to  support  this  extrapolation,  the  FDA  must  include  “brief \ndocumentation of the scientific data supporting the conclusion” that the course of the \n“disease” and the effects of the drug are sufficiently similar in adults and pediatric \npatients. 21 U.S.C. § 355c(a)(2)(B)(iii) (emphasis added). \nC.  Subpart H Regulations for Accelerated Approval of Certain New \nDrugs for Serious and Life-Threatening Illnesses. \n93.  Originally, abortion drugs were subject to a safety regimen commonly \nreferred to as Subpart H. Subpart H allowed the FDA to accelerate approval of drugs \nfor serious and life-threatening illnesses and authorized the FDA to require post-\napproval studies and distribution limitations. \nD.  Drugs Approved with Previous Subpart H Restrictions Deemed \nto have REMS. \n94.  In 2007, Congress codified Subpart H. 21 U.S.C. § 355-1. The Food and \nDrug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 (FDAAA) authorized the FDA to \nrequire persons submitting certain new drug applications to submit and implement \na risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) if the FDA determines that a \nREMS is “necessary to ensure that the benefits of a drug outweigh the risks of the \ndrug.” 21 U.S.C. § 355-1(a). \n20 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 195-1   Filed 10/11/24    Page 21 of 199   PageID 9318\n95.  Section 909(b)(1) of the FDAAA specified that a “drug that was approved \nbefore the effective date of this Act is . . . deemed to have in effect an approved [REMS] \n. . . if there are in effect on the effective date of this Act elements to assure safe use \n[pursuant to Subpart H, 21 C.F.R. § 514.520].” H.R. 3580, 110th Cong. (2007). Thus, \nif the FDA previously attached postmarketing restrictions on a drug approved under \nSubpart H, the FDAAA converted those restrictions into a REMS.  \n96.  For example, drugs like mifepristone previously approved with added \nsafeguards were temporarily “deemed to have in effect an approved [REMS].” Pub. L. \nNo. 110-85 at § 909(b)(1). And in 2011, the FDA approved a REMS for mifepristone \nthat “incorporated the restrictions under which the drug was originally approved.”21 \n97.  The FDA may require that the REMS “include such elements as are \nnecessary to assure safe use of the drug, because of its inherent toxicity or potential \nharmfulness” if the agency determines that the drug “is associated with a serious \nadverse drug experience.” 21 U.S.C. § 355-1(f)(1). \n98.  These  “Elements  to  Assure  Safe  Use”  (ETASU)  may  require \n(1) prescribers of the drug “have particular training or experience” or be “specially \ncertified,” (2) practitioners or health care settings that dispense the drug be “specially \ncertified,” (3) doctors dispense the drug to patients “only in certain health care \nsettings, such as hospitals,” (4) doctors dispense the drug to patients “with evidence \nor  other  documentation  of  safe-use  conditions,  such  as  laboratory  test  results,” \n(5) each patient be subject to “certain monitoring,” and (6) each patient be enrolled in \na “registry.” 21 U.S.C. § 355-1(f)(3). \n99.  The  FDA  may  require  an  applicant  to  monitor  and  evaluate \nimplementation of the REMS, in addition to working to improve those elements. 21 \nU.S.C. § 355-1(g). \n                                            \n21 Ex. 2, 2016 Summary Review at 4. \n21 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 195-1   Filed 10/11/24    Page 22 of 199   PageID 9319\n100.  The  FDA  may  also  include  a  communication  plan  to  health  care \nproviders to disseminate certain information about the drug and its risks. 21 U.S.C. \n§ 355-1(e)(3). \n101.  An applicant “may propose the addition, modification, or removal of [the \nink REMS] . . . and shall include an adequate rationale to support such proposed \naddition, modification, or removal.” 21 U.S.C. § 355-1(g)(4)(A). \nE.  Federal Laws Restrict Distribution of Abortion Drugs to Women. \n102.  Two federal laws restrict the distribution of abortion-inducing drugs. 18 \nU.S.C. §§ 1461–62.  \n103.  First, 18 U.S.C. § 1461 prohibits the use of postal “mails” to convey or \ndeliver abortion drugs to women. Specifically, it prohibits the mailing or delivery by \nany letter carrier of “[e]very article or thing designed, adapted, or intended for \nproducing  abortion”  and  “[e]very  …  drug…advertised  or  described  in  a  manner \ncalculated to lead to another to use or apply it for producing abortion.” \n104.  Second, 18 U.S.C. § 1462 broadly prohibits the use of “any express \ncompany or other common carrier” or “interactive computer service” to transport \nabortion drugs in interstate or foreign commerce to women. Specifically, it prohibits \nthe use of any express company, common carrier, or interactive computer service to \ndistribute “any drug, medicine, article, or thing designed, adapted, or intended for \nproducing abortion.” \nIV. The FDA’s Review and Approval of the Population Council’s Application \nto Market Abortion Drugs in the United States. \n105.  The French pharmaceutical company Roussel Uclaf S.A. first developed \nand tested mifepristone under the name RU-486. By April 1990, the drug had become \nfully available in France.22 \n                                            \n22 Ex. 15, 2002 Citizen Petition of AAPLOG to FDA at 7–8 (Aug. 8, 2002). \n22 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 195-1   Filed 10/11/24    Page 23 of 199   PageID 9320\n106.  After  obtaining  the  American  patent  rights  to  mifepristone,  the \nPopulation Council, a not-for-profit organization, conducted clinical trials in the \nUnited States.23 \n107.  The  Population  Council  then  filed  a  new  drug  application  for \n“mifepristone 200 mg tablets” on March 18, 1996.24 It received priority review.25 \n108.  The FDA approved mifepristone in 2000. The FDA said it had considered \nthe drug under Subpart H because “restrictions ... on the distribution and use of \nmifepristone are needed to assure safe use of this product.”26 \n109.  The FDA told the Population Council that the agency would proceed \nunder Subpart H because the FDA “concluded that adequate information has not \nbeen presented to demonstrate that the drug, when marketed in accordance with the \nterms of distribution proposed, is safe and effective for use as recommended.”27 \n110.  Given the known dangers of abortion drugs, the FDA approved the \nPopulation Council’s application under Subpart H because this was the only means \n“to assure safe use.” 21 C.F.R. § 314.520. \n111.  On  September  28,  2000,  the  FDA  approved  abortion  drugs  under \nSubpart H “for the medical termination of intrauterine pregnancies through 49 days’ \npregnancy.”28  \n                                            \n23 Id. at 9. \n24 Id. at 10. \n25 Id. \n26 Ex. 16, FDA Letter to Population Council re: NDA (Feb. 18, 2000) at 5. \n27 Id. \n28 Ex. 17, 2000 FDA Approval Letter for Mifeprex (mifepristone) Tablets at 1 (Sept. \n28, 2000). \n23 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 195-1   Filed 10/11/24    Page 24 of 199   PageID 9321\n112.  The FDA informed the Population Council that Subpart H “applies when \nFDA concludes that a drug product shown to be effective can be safely used only if \ndistribution or use is restricted, such as to certain physicians with certain skills or \nexperience.”29 \n113.  The FDA could not approve mifepristone without invoking Subpart H, \nas it was the only authority under which it could apply postmarketing restrictions on \nabortion drugs.30 \n114.  The FDA stated that mifepristone “labeling is now part of a total risk \nmanagement program.” In particular, “[t]he professional labeling, Medication Guide, \nPatient Agreement, and Prescriber’s Agreement will together constitute the approved \nproduct labeling to ensure any future generic drug manufacturers will have the same \nrisk management program.”31 \n115.  The 2000 approval required the Population Council to include on the \ndrugs’ label a “black box warning for special problems, particularly those that may \nlead to death or serious injury.”32 \n116.  It also contained measures to assure safe use, including requiring at \nleast three office visits: (1) the Day 1 in-person dispensing and administration of \nmifepristone; (2) the Day 3 in-person dispensing and administration of misoprostol; \n                                            \n29 Ex. 18, 2000 FDA Approval Memo. to Population Council re: NDA 20-687 Mifeprex \n(mifepristone) at 6 (Sept. 28, 2000) (2000 FDA Approval Memo). \n30 Ex. 19, 2003 Citizen Petitioners’ Response to Opposition Comments filed by The \nPopulation Council, Inc. and Danco Laboratories, LLC to Comments at 2–4 (Oct. 10, \n2003),  https://www.aaplog.org/wp-content/uploads/2002/08/ResponseToDanco10-\n03reRU-486.pdf (2003 Response). \n31 Supra note 29, 2000 FDA Approval Memo at 2. \n32 Id. \n24 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 195-1   Filed 10/11/24    Page 25 of 199   PageID 9322\nand (3) the Day 14 return to the doctor’s office to confirm no fetal parts or tissue \nremain.33 \n117.  The FDA explained that “[r]eturning to the health care provider on Day \n3 for misoprostol . . . assures that the misoprostol is correctly administered,” and it \n“has the additional advantage of contact between the patient and health care provider \nto provide ongoing care, and to reinforce the need to return on Day 14 to confirm that \nexpulsion has occurred.”34 \n118.  The FDA’s Subpart H restrictions included the safeguard under which \nany hospitalization, transfusion, or other serious events must be reported.35 \n119.  The FDA’s restrictions on the distribution of mifepristone included: \n•  In-person dispensing; \n•  Secure shipping procedures; \n•  Tracking system ability; \n•  Use of authorized distributors and agents; and \n•  Provision  of  the  drug  through  a  direct,  confidential  physician \ndistribution  system  that  ensures  only  qualified  physicians  will \nreceive the drug for patient dispensing.36 \n120.  The Population Council granted Danco Laboratories, LLC (“Danco”)—\nincorporated in the Cayman Islands in 1995—an exclusive license to manufacture, \nmarket, and distribute Mifeprex in the United States.37 \n                                            \n33 Id. at 2–3. \n34 Id. at 3. \n35 Id. at 6. \n36 Id. \n37 Ex. 15, 2002 Citizen Petition at 9. \n25 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 195-1   Filed 10/11/24    Page 26 of 199   PageID 9323\nV. 2002 Citizen Petition \n121.  In  August  2002,  the  American  Association  of  Pro-Life  OBGYNs \n(AAPLOG) and Christian Medical & Dental Associations (CMDA), along with the \nConcerned Women for America, submitted a citizen petition with the FDA pursuant \nto 21 C.F.R. §§ 10.30 and 10.35; 21 C.F.R. Part 314, Subpart H (§§ 314.500–314.560); \nand Section 505 of the FDCA (21 U.S.C. § 355).38  \n122.  Before litigants may seek court intervention, the FDA’s regulations \nrequire them to submit a “citizen petition” requesting the agency take or refrain from \ntaking any form of administration action before filing a lawsuit. 21 C.F.R. §§ 10.30, \n10.45(b). These regulations allow the FDA to indefinitely delay a final response to a \ncitizen petition. 21 C.F.R. § 10.30(e)(2)(iv). The FDA’s eventual decision on a citizen \npetition constitutes a final agency action for the underlying FDA action and the \nrelated citizen petition, and both are reviewable in the courts under the APA. 21 \nC.F.R. § 10.45(c). \n123.  Following  the  procedure  outlined  in  21  C.F.R.  §  10.45(b),  the  2002 \nPetitioners requested that the FDA impose an immediate stay of the approval of \nmifepristone and ultimately revoke the approval, in addition to requesting a full FDA \naudit of the underlying clinical studies.39 \n124.  The  2002  Petitioners  challenged  the  FDA’s  2000  Approval  because \nDanco’s studies included safeguards not included in the approved label.40 \n                                            \n38 Id. at 1. \n39 Id. \n40 Id. at 76. \n26 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 195-1   Filed 10/11/24    Page 27 of 199   PageID 9324\nVI. Implementation of a REMS for Mifepristone. \n125.  After receiving the 2002 Citizen Petition, the FDA followed Congress’s \nmandate under the FDAAA to convert Subpart H postmarketing restrictions for \npreviously approved drugs into a REMS under Section 909(b)(1).  \n126.  In  a  March  27,  2008  Federal  Register  notice,  the  FDA  identified \nmifepristone as one of “those drugs that FDA has determined will be deemed to have \nin effect an approved REMS.”41 \n127.  In 2011, the FDA then approved a REMS for mifepristone.42 \n128.  The  FDA  “determined  that  a  REMS  is  necessary  for  MIFEPREX \n(mifepristone)  to  ensure  the  benefits  of  the  drug  outweigh  the  risks  of  serious \ncomplications.”43 \n129.  The REMS incorporated the previous Subpart H restrictions (including \na black-box warning on the label for special problems, in-person dispensing, post-\nabortion  office  visits,  the  ability  to  assess  gestational  age  and  diagnose  ectopic \npregnancies, adverse event reporting, and the ability to provide surgical intervention \nor ensure patient access to other qualified physicians or medical facilities). The new \nREMS  consisted  of  a  Medication  Guide,  elements  to  assure  safe  use,  an \nimplementation  system,  and  a  timetable  for  submission  of  assessments  of  the \nREMS.44 \n                                            \n41 Identification of Drug and Biological Products Deemed to Have Risk Evaluation \nand  Mitigation  Strategies  for  Purposes  of  the  Food  and  Drug  Administration \nAmendments Act of 2007, 73 Fed. Reg. 16,313, 16,314 (Mar. 27, 2008). \n42 Ex. 20, 2011 FDA Supplemental Approval Letter to Danco Laboratories, LLC at 1 \n(June 6, 2011) (2011 Approval Letter). \n43 Id. at 1. \n44 Id. at 1; Ex. 21, 2011 REMS for NDA 20-687 Mifeprex (mifepristone) Tablets, \n200mg (June 8, 2011) (2011 REMS). \n27 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 195-1   Filed 10/11/24    Page 28 of 199   PageID 9325\n130.  The REMS required “prescribers to certify that they are qualified to \nprescribe  MIFEPREX  (mifepristone)  and  are  able  to  assure  patient  access  to \nappropriate medical facilities to manage any complications.”45 \n131.  The FDA also instructed Danco that, “[a]s part of the approval under \nSubpart H, as required by 21 CFR § 314.550, you must submit all promotional \nmaterials, including promotional labeling as well as advertisements, at least 30 days \nbefore the intended time of initial distribution of the labeling or initial publication of \nthe advertisement.”46 \nVII. The FDA’s Denial of the 2002 Citizen Petition. \n132.  Almost fourteen years after receiving the 2002 Citizen Petition—on \nMarch 29, 2016—the FDA denied the 2002 Citizen Petition (“2016 Denial”).47 \nVIII. The FDA’s 2016 Major Changes to the Mifepristone Regimen. \n133.  On the same day that the FDA denied the 2002 Citizen Petition, it also \napproved “major changes” to the mifepristone regimen (2016 Major Changes) in \nresponse to an sNDA that Danco had submitted to the FDA on May 28, 2015.48 \n134.  The FDA acknowledged that “these major changes are interrelated,” \ndemonstrating the agency’s awareness that each change impacted the others.49 \n                                            \n45 Ex. 20, 2011 Approval Letter at 1; Ex. 21, 2011 REMS. \n46 Ex. 20, 2011 Approval Letter at 2–3. \n47 Ex. 22, 2016 FDA Letter to AAPLOG, Christian Medical & Dental Associations, \nand Concerned Women for America denying 2002 Citizen Petition, Docket No. FDA-\n2002-P-0364 (Mar. 29, 2016) (2016 Petition Denial). \n48 Ex. 23, 2016 FDA Letter to Danco Laboratories re: NDA 020687, Supp 20 (Mar. 29, \n2016). \n49 Ex. 2, 2016 Summary Review at 6. \n28 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 195-1   Filed 10/11/24    Page 29 of 199   PageID 9326\n135.   Among other things, the 2016 Major Changes included the following \nrevisions: \nA.  extending the maximum gestational age at which a woman or a girl can \nabort her baby from 49 days to 70 days; \nB.  removing the requirement for any in-person follow-up examination after \nan abortion (including follow-up examinations on Days 3 and 14);  \nC.  allowing “healthcare providers” other than physicians to dispense and \nadminister the abortion drugs.50 \n136.  Despite these three major changes to the regimen, the FDA eliminated \nthe safeguard under which prescribers must report all nonfatal serious adverse \nevents from mifepristone. Rather than require future adverse-event reports from \nabortion providers, the FDA simply asserted that “after 15 years of reporting serious \nadverse events, the safety profile for Mifeprex is essentially unchanged.” The FDA \nconceded that “[i]t is important that the Agency be informed of any deaths with \nMifeprex to monitor new safety signals or trends.”51 \n137.  The  2016  Major  Changes  also  included changes  to  dosing,  route  of \nadministration, and timing of administration, which are not challenged here. \nF.  The FDA’s Evidence for the Safety and Effectiveness of the 2016 \nMajor Changes. \n138.  Despite acknowledging that the 2016 changes were interrelated, the \nFDA’s review and approval did not include a single study that evaluated the safety \nand effectiveness of mifepristone and misoprostol under the conditions prescribed, \nrecommended, or suggested in the proposed labeling. In particular, it did not assess \n                                            \n50 Id. at 6–10. \n51 Id. at 27. \n29 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 195-1   Filed 10/11/24    Page 30 of 199   PageID 9327\nthe  cumulative  effects  of  increasing  the  gestational  age  from  7  to  10  weeks, \neliminating follow-up visits to check for complications, and requiring the supervision \nof a physician capable of treating complications. \n139.  Instead, the FDA relied on studies that evaluated only one or some of \nthe changes. And many studies included additional safeguards not required under \nthe new REMS, such as an ultrasound to confirm gestational age and pregnancy \nlocation. \n140.  The FDA never explained why it could rely on studies assessing only \nsome of the interrelated changes. \n141.  For example, the FDA relied on three studies that “closely mirrored” the \n2016 changes,52 but all of them included in-person, post-abortion follow-up visits—\none  of  the  safeguards  the  agency  removed  despite  previously  calling  it  “very \nimportant.”53 Yet the FDA provided no explanation for why it could rely on this study \nfor amending the gestational age, physician requirement, and follow-up visits. \n142.  Additionally, increasing the maximum gestational age by three full \nweeks indisputably increases rates of abortion failures, surgical interventions, and \ncomplications.54 Simultaneously removing the two in-person follow-up visits that \nafford the opportunity to diagnose and treat complications before they result in an \n                                            \n52 See Brief for the Federal Petitioners at 38–39, FDA v. Alliance for Hippocratic \nMedicine, 602 U.S. 367 (2024) (No. 23-235). \n53 Ex. 24, 2000 Mifeprex Label 15, https://perma.cc/3V7C-SU6Q. \n54 Ex. 25, Mifeprex (mifepristone) Prescribing and Label information (Jan. 2023); Ex. \n26, Melissa J.

But the FDA did not assess the impacts of \ndoing both in any study.55 \n143.  As the Fifth Circuit noted, such variations between the study conditions \nand the approved labeling and the collective impact of all the 2016 changes as a whole \nare  “unquestionably  an  important  aspect  of  the  problem”  that  the  FDA  had  a \nstatutory duty to address. AHM, 78 F.4th at 246. It therefore held: “[t]he problem is \nnot that [the] FDA failed to conduct a clinical trial that included each of the proposed \nchanges as a control,” but that the “FDA failed to address the cumulative effect at \nall.” Id. \nG.  The FDA’s Lack of Research on Pediatric Populations for the \n2016 Major Changes. \n144.  The FDA’s 2016 Major Changes continued to allow pregnant girls of any \nage to use mifepristone—despite not studying whether these dangerous drugs could \nhave an adverse impact on the health, safety, and welfare of developing girls.  \n145.  The FDA did not require Danco to submit an assessment on the safety \nand  effectiveness  of  the  drug  for  the  claimed  indications  in  relevant  pediatric \nsubpopulations,  nor  did  the  FDA  require  Danco  to  submit  an  assessment  that \nsupported the dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which \nthe drug is safe and effective.56   \n146.  Under PREA, “[i]f the course of the disease and the effects of the drug \nare sufficiently similar in adults and pediatric patients, the [FDA] may conclude that \npediatric effectiveness can be extrapolated from adequate and well-controlled studies \nin  adults,  usually  supplemented  with  other  information  obtained  in  pediatric \n                                            \n55 See Ex. 2, Harrison Reply. Decl. ¶ 16. \n56 Ex. 2, 2016 Summary Review at 18–20. \n31 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 195-1   Filed 10/11/24    Page 32 of 199   PageID 9329\npatients, such as pharmacokinetic studies.” 21 U.S.C. § 355c(a)(2)(B)(i) (emphasis \nadded). \n147.  PREA also requires the drug sponsor to include “[a] brief documentation \nof the scientific data supporting the conclusion” that extrapolation is warranted “in \nany pertinent review for the application under section 355 of this title[.]” 21 U.S.C. \n§ 355c(a)(2)(B)(iii). \n148.  Pregnancy is not a disease.57 The FDA therefore lacked authority under \n§ 355c(a)(2)(B)(i) to extrapolate pediatric effectiveness. \n149.  The FDA then concluded that Danco fulfilled its PREA obligations “by \nsubmitting  published  studies  of  Mifeprex  for  pregnancy  termination  in \npostmenarcheal females less than 17 years old.” The FDA cited three published \nstudies in support of this conclusion.58 None of them satisfied the PREA requirement \nfor a specific assessment of safety for pediatric populations. \n150.  The  FDA  must  also  consider  “data,  gathered  using  appropriate \nformulations for each age group for which the assessment is required, that are \nadequate—(1) to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug or the biological \nproduct for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations; and (2) to \nsupport dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the \ndrug or the biological product is safe and effective.” 21 U.S.C. § 355c(a)(2)(A). The \nstudies relied upon by the FDA did not do either of these two things. \n151.  The primary study on which the FDA relied, Efficacy and safety of \nmedical abortion using mifepristone and buccal misoprostol through 63 days, by Mary \n                                            \n57 California by & through Becerra v. Azar, 950 F.3d 1067, 1090 n.20 (9th Cir. 2020) \n(en  banc)  (“Pregnancy  is  not  a  disease,  and  a  nontherapeutic  abortion  is  not a \ntreatment option.”).   \n58 Ex. 2, 2016 Summary Review at 18–19. \n32 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 195-1   Filed 10/11/24    Page 33 of 199   PageID 9330\nGatter  and  Deborah  Nucatola  of  Planned  Parenthood  of  Los  Angeles  and  Kelly \nCleland  of  Princeton  University’s  Office  of  Population  Research,  evaluated  the \nproposed dosing regimen followed by home administration of misoprostol through 63 \ndays’ gestation. The study also included postmenarcheal girls in the study population, \nfrom which the FDA extrapolated its conclusion.59  \n152.  A second study that the FDA cited in support of its PREA conclusion \nwas based on a nationwide registry of induced abortions and hospital-register data in \nFinland.60 For the adolescent cohort who had chemical abortions, the study found \nthat 12.8% experienced hemorrhaging, 7.0% had incomplete abortions, and 11.0% \nneeded surgical evacuation of “retained products of conception.”61 Because these \nstatistics were similar to those of the adult cohort, the FDA found these statistics \n“reassuring” to support the safety profile of chemical-abortion drugs for a pediatric \npopulation.62 \n153.  The third and final study that the FDA discussed was a study of 28 \nadolescents, ages 14 to 17 years old, with pregnancies under 57 days’ gestation.63 The \nauthors  of  this  study  cautioned  that  a  larger  study  was  needed  to  make  any \ngeneralizable conclusions for pediatric populations.  \n154.  The  FDA  did  not  require  any  studies  on  the  long-term  effects  of \nmifepristone in pediatric populations with developing reproductive systems. \n                                            \n59 Id. at 19 (citing Ex. 28, Mary Gatter et al., Efficacy and safety of medical abortion \nusing mifepristone and buccal misoprostol through 63 days, 91 Contraception 269 \n(2015)). \n60 Ex. 2, 2016 Summary Review at 19–20 (citing Ex. 6, Niinimaki, supra note 11). \n61 Ex. 6, Niinimaki, supra note 11 at 3–4. \n62 Ex. 2, 2016 Summary Review at 20. \n63 Id. at 19. \n33 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 195-1   Filed 10/11/24    Page 34 of 199   PageID 9331\n155.  Given  the  limitations  with  the  three  cited  studies,  FDA  needed  to \nextrapolate the safety of the 2016 Major Changes for adolescent girls. But the agency \ncould  not  avail itself  of  the  extrapolation  exception  because  pregnancy  is  not  a \n“disease.” \nIX. 2019 Citizen Petition \n156.  In response to the 2016 Major Changes, on March 29, 2019, AAPLOG \nand American College of Pediatricians (ACPeds) (collectively, the 2019 Petitioners) \nsubmitted to the FDA a citizen petition (2019 Citizen Petition) pursuant to 21 C.F.R. \n§§ 10.30 and 10.35; 21 C.F.R. Part 314, Subpart H (§§ 314.500–314.560); and Section \n505 of the FDCA (21 U.S.C. § 355).  \n157.  The 2019 Petitioners asked the FDA to (1) “restore and strengthen \nelements of the Mifeprex regimen and prescriber requirements approved in 2000” \nand, in the event that the FDA denied that request, (2) “retain the Mifeprex Risk \nEvaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS), and continue limiting the dispensing of \nMifeprex  to  patients  in  clinics,  medical  offices,  and  hospitals,  by  or  under  the \nsupervision of a certified prescriber.”64 \n158.   The 2019 Citizen Petition asked the FDA to take the following actions \nto  restore  and  strengthen  elements  of  the  chemical-abortion-drug  regimen  and \nprescriber requirements approved in 2000 to protect the health, safety, and welfare \nof women: \nA.  Reducing the maximum gestational age from 70 days to 49 days; \nB.  Limiting  the  ability  to  prescribe  and  dispense  abortion  drugs  to \nqualified, licensed physicians—not other “healthcare providers”; \n                                            \n64 Ex. 29, 2019 Citizen Petition of AAPLOG to FDA (Mar. 29, 2019). \n34 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 195-1   Filed 10/11/24    Page 35 of 199   PageID 9332\nC.  Mandating  certified  abortion  providers  be  physically  present  when \ndispensing abortion drugs; \nD.  Requiring  that  the  prescriber  perform  an  ultrasound  to  assess \ngestational age, identify ectopic pregnancies, ensure compliance with \nFDA restrictions, and adequately inform the woman of gestational age-\nspecific risks, which rise with increasing gestational age; \nE.  Restoring the requirement for in-person administration of misoprostol; \nF.  Restoring the requirement for an in-person follow-up visit to confirm \nabortion  and  rule  out  life-threatening  infection  through  clinical \nexamination or ultrasonographic scan; \nG.  Restoring the 2000 label language that stated that abortion drugs are \ncontraindicated if a woman lacks adequate access to emergency medical \ncare; and \nH.  Restoring the prescriber reporting requirements for all serious adverse \nevents,  including  any  deaths,  hospitalizations,  blood  transfusions, \nemergency room visits, failures requiring surgical completion, ongoing \npregnancy, or other major complications following the chemical abortion \nregimen.65 \n159.  The 2019 Petitioners also asked the FDA to require a formal study of \noutcomes for at-risk populations, including the pediatric female population, patients \nwith repeat chemical abortions, patients who have limited access to emergency room \nservices, and patients who self-administer misoprostol.66 \n                                            \n65 Id. \n66 Id. at 13–14. \n35 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 195-1   Filed 10/11/24    Page 36 of 199   PageID 9333\n160.  The 2019 Citizen Petition explained that “[t]he developmental stage of \npuberty involves a complex interplay of both progesterone and estrogen effects on the \ndeveloping female reproductive system.” Therefore, “[t]he use, and especially the \npotential multiple use, of Mifeprex, which is a powerful progesterone blocker, is likely \nto  significantly  impact  the  developing  reproductive  system  of  the  adolescent \nfemale.”67  \n161.  At a minimum, the 2019 Citizen Petition requested that the FDA retain \nthe mifepristone REMS and continue limiting the dispensing of mifepristone to \nclinics, medical offices, and hospitals, by or under the supervision of a certified \nprescriber. In other words, it requested the FDA do no further harm to the few \nremaining safeguards for women who undergo the abortion drug regimen.68 \n162.  In  particular,  the  2019  Petitioners  explained  that  eliminating  or \nrelaxing  the  REMS  to  facilitate  internet  or  telephone  prescriptions  would  be \ndangerous  to  women.69  The  2019  Citizen  Petition  also  raised  concerns  about \ndispensing from a pharmacy instead of a clinical facility.70 \n163.  The 2019 Citizen Petition provided the FDA with detailed analysis and \ndata to support these requests. \n                                            \n67 Id. \n68 Id. at 14–25. \n69 Id. at 18–20. \n70 Id. at 20–23. \n36 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 195-1   Filed 10/11/24    Page 37 of 199   PageID 9334\nX. The FDA’s Approval of a Generic Version of Mifeprex and a Single, Shared \nSystem REMS. \n164.  On April 11, 2019, the FDA approved GenBioPro, Inc.’s71 generic version \nof Mifeprex, “Mifepristone Tablets, 200 mg” (2019 ANDA Approval) since the agency \n“concluded that adequate information has been presented to demonstrate that the \ndrug is safe and effective for use as recommended in the submitted labeling.”72 The \nFDA determined GenBioPro’s Mifepristone Tablets, 200 mg, “to be bioequivalent and, \ntherefore, therapeutically equivalent to the reference listed drug (RLD), Mifeprex \nTablets,  200  mg,  of  Danco  Laboratories,  LLC.”  GenBioPro’s  generic  version  of \nmifepristone has the same labeling and REMS as does Danco’s Mifeprex.73 GenBioPro \nsells the only generic mifepristone and misoprostol, and these sales are the company’s \nonly product and sole source of revenue.74 \n165.   On  the  same  day,  the  FDA  approved  modifications  to  the  existing \nREMS for mifepristone to establish a single, shared system REMS for mifepristone \nproducts for the “medical termination of intrauterine pregnancy,” thus allowing the \nFDA to have a uniform REMS for the abortion drugs that two companies were now \n                                            \n71 GenBioPro, Inc. is located at 3651 Lindell Road, Suite D1041, Las Vegas, Nevada. \nhttps://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/fda/fdaDrugXsl.cfm?setid=4179736a-1cb2-\n4661-8c50-3d68ec7f4025&type=display. \n72 Ex. 30, 2019 FDA ANDA Approval Letter to GenBioPro, Inc.

On  April  20,  2020,  the  American  College  of  Obstetricians  and \nGynecologists (ACOG) and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine (SMFM) sent a \njoint letter (2020 ACOG-SMFM Letter), rather than a citizen petition, to the FDA \nasking the agency to remove the in-person dispensing protection for mifepristone \nduring the COVID-19 pandemic and instead allow dispensing by mail or mail-order \npharmacy.76 \n167.   One month later, ACOG and others filed suit to enjoin the FDA’s in-\nperson dispensing protection for mifepristone during the pandemic. Am. Coll. of \nObstetricians & Gynecologists v. FDA, 472 F. Supp. 3d 183 (D. Md. 2020). \n168.  The  district  court  granted  a  nationwide  preliminary  injunction  and \nlifted the in-person dispensing protection for the pandemic.

The FDA also explained that it had reviewed \n“thousands of adverse events resulting from the use of Mifeprex,” determined that \nabortion drugs continue to cause “serious risks for up to seven percent of patients,” \nand concluded that an in-office visit was “necessary to mitigate [those] serious risks.” \nId. at 4, 7, 21.

Just three months after the Supreme Court granted FDA’s request for a \nstay, on April 12, 2021, the FDA stated that it “intends to exercise enforcement \ndiscretion” of the in-person dispensing protection during the COVID pandemic (2021 \nNon-Enforcement Decision).77 \n171.   The  FDA’s  2021  Non-Enforcement  Decision  relied,  in  part,  on  a \nsupposed  lack  of  reported  adverse  events  occurring  between  January  2020  and \nJanuary 2021—despite the agency’s elimination of non-fatal reporting requirements \nfor abortion providers in 2016. Nevertheless, in 2021, the FDA still “found that the \nsmall number of adverse events reported to FDA during the COVID-19 public health \nemergency  (PHE)  provided  no  indication  that  any  program  deviation  or \nnoncompliance with the Mifepristone REMS Program contributed to the reported \nadverse events.”78 But given the limitations of the FDA’s adverse-event reporting, the \nagency could not—and did not—conclude that these reported events showed that \nremoving the in-person dispensing protection was safe for women’s health.79 \n                                            \n77 Ex. 32, 2021 FDA Letter to ACOG and SMFM About Mifepristone REMS, at 2 (Apr. \n12, 2021). \n78 Id.  \n79 Id. \n39 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 195-1   Filed 10/11/24    Page 40 of 199   PageID 9337\n172.  The FDA’s 2021 Non-Enforcement Decision neither acknowledged nor \naddressed the federal laws expressly prohibiting the distribution of mifepristone by \nmail, express company, common carrier, or interactive computer service—despite \nexplicitly  recognizing  that  this  action  would  allow  “dispensing  of  mifepristone \nthrough the mail . . . or through a mail-order pharmacy.”80 \nXIII.  The FDA’s December 2021 Decision to Permanently Remove the In-\nPerson Dispensing Protections. \n173.  In  a  December  16,  2021  letter,  the  FDA  “determined  that  the \nMifepristone REMS Program continues to be necessary to ensure that the benefits of \nthe drug outweigh the risks,” but that “it must be modified to minimize the burden \non the health care delivery system of complying with the REMS and to ensure that \nthe benefits of the drug outweigh the risks.”81 \n174.   The  letter  identified  specific  new  modifications  to  the  REMS: \n“(1) removing  the  requirement  that  mifepristone  be  dispensed  only  in  certain \nhealthcare settings, specifically clinics, medical offices, and hospitals (i.e., the ‘in-\nperson dispensing requirement’); and (2) adding a requirement that pharmacies that \ndispense the drug be specially certified,” signaling that the FDA would soon allow \npharmacies to dispense abortion drugs.82 \n175.  The Letter acknowledged that the FDA had answered the “related” 2019 \nCitizen Petition and would post the agency’s response in the public docket.83 \n                                            \n80 Id. \n81  Ex.  33,  2021  FDA  Center  for  Drug  Evaluation  &  Research  Director  Patrizia \nCavazzoni Letter to Dr. Graham Chelius (Dec. 16, 2021).   \n82 Id. \n83 Id. \n40 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 195-1   Filed 10/11/24    Page 41 of 199   PageID 9338\nXIV.  The FDA’s Denial and Grant of the 2019 Citizen Petition. \n176.  That same day—and over 2.5 years after receiving the 2019 Citizen \nPetition—the FDA denied in part and granted in part the 2019 Citizen Petition (2021 \nFDA Response).84  \n177.  The FDA granted the 2019 Citizen Petition only to the extent that the \nagency agreed that a REMS is necessary to ensure that the “benefits of mifepristone \nin a regimen with misoprostol outweigh the risks.” But the FDA retained only the \nPrescriber Agreement Form and the Patient Agreement Form as the remaining \nelements of the REMS.85 \n178.  The FDA otherwise denied the 2019 Citizen Petition’s requests (1) to \nrestore and strengthen the mifepristone and prescriber requirements approved in \n2000 and (2) to continue limiting the dispensing of mifepristone to women in clinics, \nmedical offices, and hospitals, by or under the supervision of a certified prescriber.86 \n179.  The FDA defended its decision to remove safeguards in the 2016 Major \nChanges  and  repeated  its  previous  justifications  not  to  require  studies  in  the \npertinent pediatric population in the 2016 Major Changes. The agency again asserted \nthat “the safety and efficacy were expected to be the same for postpubertal (i.e., post-\nmenarchal) adolescents.”87 \n180.  The  FDA  further  stated  that  the  REMS  for  mifepristone  “must  be \nmodified to remove the requirement that mifepristone be dispensed only in certain \nhealthcare settings, specifically clinics, medical offices, and hospitals, because this \n                                            \n84 Ex. 34, 2021 FDA Letter to AAPLOG and Am.

In support of its claim that in-person dispensing is unnecessary, the \nFDA relied on the “small” number of adverse events voluntarily reported in the FDA \nAdverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database to justify the elimination of this \nsafeguard, even though the FDA had years before removed the requirement for \nabortion providers to report nonfatal adverse events.89 \n182.  The FDA relied on the FAERS database despite conceding these facts: \n“FAERS data does have limitations”; the “FDA does not receive reports for every \nadverse event”; and thus “FAERS data cannot be used to calculate the incidence of \nan adverse event . . . in the U.S.”90 \n183.  The FAERS “is woefully inadequate to determine the post-marketing \nsafety of mifepristone due to its inability to adequately assess the frequency or \nseverity of adverse events” and the adverse events reported to the FDA “represent a \nfraction of the actual adverse events occurring in American women.”91 Reporting \n“discrepancies  [that]  render  the  FAERS  inadequate  to  evaluate  the  safety  of \nmifepristone abortions.”92  \n                                            \n88 Id. at 25. \n89 Id. at 25–36. \n90  Ex.  35,  Questions  and  Answers  on  FDA’s  Adverse  Event  Reporting  System \n(FAERS),  https://www.fda.gov/drugs/surveillance/questions-and-answers-fdas-\nadverse-event-reporting-system-faers. \n91 Ex. 36, Kathi A.

The complicated FAERS electronic submission process further hinders \nthe reporting of adverse events and exacerbates the unreliability of the number of \nadverse event reports.93 Doctors or other interested individuals seeking to submit an \nadverse  event  report  must  navigate  a  confusing,  complicated,  acronym-laden \nwebpage.94 Recognizing this difficulty in submitting adverse event reports, the FDA \nprovides a 48-page manual as guidance on the technical specifications for submitting \nan adverse event form.95 \n185.  In  addition  to  FAERS  data,  the  FDA  evaluated  “assessment  data” \nconcerning  healthcare  provider  certification,  program  utilization,  and  non-\ncompliance. It noted that the eight reported cases of adverse events from these data \nwere also identified in the FAERS database.96 \n186.  The FDA also claimed support from published literature evaluating \nmail-order dispensing by pharmacies and clinics.97 Yet the agency conceded that it \nwas unable to “generalize” the results to the United States population, and that “the \nusefulness of the studies is limited in some instances by small sample sizes and lack \nof  follow-up  information  on  outcomes.”98  The  FDA  thus acknowledged  that  “the \nstudies [it] reviewed are not adequate on their own to establish the safety of the model \n                                            \n93 Ex. 4, Harrison Compl.

The  FDA  reviewed  three  studies  for  “mail  order  pharmacy \ndispensing.”101  \n188.  One (Hyland) reported that 3 percent of the participants needed to be \nhospitalized—a 330 percent increase over the rate on the approved label.102 The FDA \ndisregarded this dramatic increase, saying it could not make any “conclusions on \n[that study’s] safety findings.”103  \n189.  Another  study  (Upadhyay)  had  certain  “deviations”  from  abortion \npractices in the United States, “limited follow-up information, and small sample \nsize”—all of which “limit[ed] [its] usefulness.”104  \n190.  The  third  study,  an  “interim  analysis”  (Grossman),  was  largely \ninapplicable because it evaluated outcomes for “dispens[ing] by mail-order pharmacy \nafter in-person clinical assessment.”105 \n191.  The FDA also cited five studies that “evaluated clinic dispensing by \nmail.”106  \n                                            \n99 Id. at 35 (emphasis added). \n100 Id. at 28. \n101 Id. at 30. \n102  Id.  at  31.

In one (Raymond), “7 percent of participants had clinical encounters in \n[emergency department (ED)]/urgent care centers.”107  \n193.  In another (Chong), “6 percent of participants had unplanned clinical \nencounters in ED/urgent care,” and “[s]urgical interventions were required in 4.1 \npercent to complete abortion.”108  \n194.  A third study (Anger) revealed that “12.5 percent had an unplanned \nclinical encounter.”109  \n195.  In the fourth study (Kerestes), 5.8 percent in the “telemedicine plus mail \ngroup” had “ED visits,” a rate exceeding the range on the label (2.9 to 4.6 percent) \nand almost three times higher than its 2.1 percent comparator figure for women who \nhad an “in-person” visit.110  \n196.  The  final  study  (Aiken)  had  “significant  limitations”  because \n“investigators were unable to verify the outcomes” and “the study’s design did not \ncapture all serious safety outcomes.”111 \n197.  After reviewing these studies, the FDA conceded that “the literature \nsuggests there may be more frequent ED/urgent care visits related to the use of \nmifepristone  when  dispensed  by  mail  from  the  clinic.”112  The  agency  similarly \nacknowledged  that  the  Anger  study  “suggests  a  pre-abortion  examination  may \n                                            \n107 Id. at 32. \n108 Id. \n109 Id. at 32–33. \n110 Id. at 33. \n111 Id. at 34. \n112 Id. at 35; accord id. at 33–34. \n45 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 195-1   Filed 10/11/24    Page 46 of 199   PageID 9343\ndecrease  the  occurrence  of  procedural  intervention  and  decrease  the  number  of \nunplanned visits for postabortion care.”113  \n198.  Nevertheless, the FDA concluded that “these studies overall support \nthat dispensing by mail from the clinic is safe,”114 and that mifepristone would \n“remain  safe  and  efficacy  [would]  be  maintained”  if  it  removed  the  in-person \ndispensing protection from the REMS program.115 \n199.  The FDA’s 2021 Petition Response neither acknowledged nor addressed \nthe  federal  laws  expressly  prohibiting  the  distribution  of  mifepristone  by  mail, \nexpress company, common carrier, or interactive computer service.  \n200.  In January 2023, the FDA rejected a similar petition submitted on \nDecember 13, 2022, by Students for Life of America and other signatories (SFLA \nPetition).  \n201.  The SFLA Petition requested that the FDA reverse its 2021 and 2016 \nmodifications and restore the 2011 mifepristone REMS. The FDA noted that the relief \nrequested by SFLA was “the same or substantially the same as” the 2019 Citizen \nPetition and directed SFLA to its “December 16, 2021 response to that petition.”116  \n   \n                                            \n113 Id. at 33. \n114 Id. at 34. \n115 Id. at 28. \n116 Ex. 40, 2023 FDA Letter to Students for Life of Am. denying 2022 SFLA Petition, \nDocket No. FDA-2022-P-3209, at 2 (Jan. 3, 2023), https://www.regulations.gov/docu\nment/FDA-2022-P-3209-0003. \n46 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 195-1   Filed 10/11/24    Page 47 of 199   PageID 9344\n202.

The FDA’s 2021/2023 Removal of the In-Person Dispensing \nProtection. \n203.  In April 2021, prior to the agency’s denial of almost all of the 2019 \nCitizen  Petition,  the  FDA  “announced  that,  in  connection  with  the  COVID-19 \npandemic,  the  agency  would  not  enforce  the  in-person  dispensing  protection. \nEffectively, this allowed mifepristone to be prescribed remotely and sent via mail.” \nAHM, 78 F.4th at 226. The FDA’s April 2021 action expressly allowed “dispensing [] \n47 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 195-1   Filed 10/11/24    Page 48 of 199   PageID 9345\nmifepristone through the mail ... or through a mail-order pharmacy” during the \napplicable time period.117  \n204.  In December 2021, the FDA decided to permanently remove the in-\nperson dispensing protection.118 \n205.  Pursuant  to  its  December  2021  decision,  the  FDA  “amended \nmifepristone’s REMS (which applies to Mifeprex and the generic version) in January \nof 2023 to formalize the removal of the in-person dispensing requirement.” AHM, 78 \nF.4th at 226.  \n206.  The  FDA  acknowledged  in  2023  that  it  had  “determined”  on \n“12/16/2021” that “the REMS must be modified to remove the in-person dispensing \nrequirement.”119  \n207.  It added in its 2023 Summary Review that, following its 2021 decision, \n“[t]he number of adverse events reported to FDA during the COVID-19 PHE with \nmifepristone use is small.” And that this additional data “provide[d] no indication \nthat any program deviation or noncompliance with the Mifepristone REMS Program \ncontributed to these reported adverse events.”120 \n208.  The FDA also noted that the format of the REMS document would not \nbe changed “[t]o avoid the misperception that this REMS modification is making \nmajor  changes  to  the  REMS  document  that  go  beyond  our December  16,  2021, \ndetermination that the REMS must be modified to remove the in-person dispensing \n                                            \n117 Ex. 32, 2021 FDA Letter to ACOG and SMFM About Mifepristone REMS at 2. \n118 Ex. 34, 2021 FDA Response at 6. \n119 Ex. 3, FDA 2023 Summary Review at 6. \n120 Id. at 38. \n48 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 195-1   Filed 10/11/24    Page 49 of 199   PageID 9346\nrequirement and add pharmacy certification,” and that the “[c]hanges are in line with \nthe REMS Modification Notification letters sent December 16, 2021.”121 \n209.  The  FDA’s  January  2023  REMS  permanently  “[r]emov[ed]  the \nrequirement  that  mifepristone  be  dispensed  only  in  certain  healthcare  settings, \nspecifically  clinics,  medical  offices  and  hospitals  (i.e.,  the  ‘in-person  dispensing \nrequirement’)” and expanded the program to allow mifepristone to be dispensed by \ncertified pharmacies, including retail pharmacies.122  \n210.  These  actions  comprise  the  2021/2023  Removal  of  the  In-Person \nDispensing Protection.  \n211.  By  March  2024,  one  year  after  the  modified  REMS  took  effect, \nWalgreens and CVS announced they had completed certification requirements and \nwould begin dispensing mifepristone in their stores.123  \n212.  The current Mifeprex Prescriber Agreement Form also requires such \nhealthcare providers to have the “[a]bility to provide surgical intervention in cases of \nincomplete abortion or severe bleeding, or have made plans to provide such care \nthrough others, and be able to assure patient access to medical facilities equipped to \nprovide blood transfusions and resuscitation, if necessary.”124 \n213.  And the current Mifepristone Patient Agreement acknowledges that \n“[m]y healthcare provider has told me that these symptoms listed above could require \n                                            \n121 Id. at 8–9, 16. \n122  Ex.  41,  REMS  Single  Shared  System  for  Mifepristone  200  mg  (Jan.  2023), \nhttps://perma.cc/MJT5-35LF (the “2023 Mail-Order Decision”). \n123 Ex.42, Pam Belluck, CVS and Walgreens Will Begin Selling Abortion Pills This \nMonth, New York Times (March 1, 2024), \nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/01/health/abortion-pills-cvs-walgreens.html. \n124 Ex. 43, Mifeprex Prescriber Agreement Form at 1. \n49 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 195-1   Filed 10/11/24    Page 50 of 199   PageID 9347\nemergency care. If I cannot reach the clinic/office/provider right away, my healthcare \nprovider has told me who to call and what to do.”125  \n214.  Dispensing  mifepristone  by  mail  also  poses  potential  problems  for \nmaintaining the appropriate level of active ingredient under uncontrolled shipping \nconditions. One 2018 study of mifepristone from India found that 18 mifepristone-\nmisoprostol combination drugs shipped over a range of three to 21 business days \ncontained within 8% of the labeled 200 mg amount of active mifepristone by the time \nthey reached their destination.126 The study did not control for humidity, heat, or \nother  conditions  affecting  active  ingredient  degradation,  posing  concerns  for \nindividuals receiving abortion drugs exposed to even harsher weather conditions. \nIndeed, the researchers projected that the 35 percent of packages that did not arrive \nwithin  the advertised  shipping  time  “may  have been  delayed  because  of  winter \nweather.”127 \n215.  FDA’s own label for mifepristone requires a storage temperature of \n“25°C (77°F); excursions permitted to 15 to 30°C (59 to 86°F) [see USP Controlled \nRoom Temperature].”128 These conditions cannot be guaranteed during standard \nshipping transit, particularly in summer or winter weather conditions. But the FDA’s \ndecision to allow mail-order abortion drugs neither acknowledged nor addressed this \nknown issue. \n216.  What’s  more,  the  study  noted  that  none  of  the  sites  on  which  the \nabortion drugs were procured “required a prescription or any medical documents. \n                                            \n125 Ex. 44, Mifepristone Patient Agreement at 1. \n126 Chloe Murtagh et al., Exploring the Feasibility of Obtaining Mifepristone and \nMisoprostol from the Internet, 97 Contraception 287 (2018). \n127 Id. at 288 (emphasis added). \n128 Supra note 7, Mifeprex 2023 Label at 13. \n50 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 195-1   Filed 10/11/24    Page 51 of 199   PageID 9348\nTwo required completion of an online medical history questionnaire; none of the \nquestions asked about gestational age or any of the specific contraindications listed \non the label for Mifeprex®, the brand of mifepristone approved for abortion by the US \nFood and Drug Administration.”129  \nXVI.  The FDA’s Recognition that Emergency Rooms would be the Backstop \nfor Abortion Drug Harm. \n217.  The FDA has consistently identified emergency rooms as the backstop \nfor abortion drug harms. ER visits are the predictable consequence of its removal of \nsafeguards.130 \n218.  Given the potential for serious adverse events, the FDA recognized that \n“access to ... emergency services is critical for the safe and effective use of the drug.”131 \nThe FDA required and still requires doctors “to assure patient access to medical \nfacilities equipped to provide blood transfusions and resuscitation, if necessary.”132 \nThe  drug  was  also  “contraindicated”  where  “access  to  emergency  services”  was \n“[in]adequate.”133 And the FDA required prescribing physicians without the ability to \nperform  emergency  services  to  “direct”  women  “to  a  hospital  for  emergency \nservices.”134 \n219.  Danco, in consultation with FDA, also issued a “Dear Emergency Room \nDirector” letter in 2004 to “assist [ER Directors] in taking care of patients who may \n                                            \n129 Murtagh, supra note 126 at 288. \n130 See Ex. 4, Harrison Compl.

In its 2011 REMS materials, the FDA warned that women should not \ntake mifepristone if they “cannot easily get emergency medical help [for] 2 weeks” \nafter taking the drug.137 The REMS required prescribers “to assure patient access to \nappropriate medical facilities” that were “equipped to provide blood transfusions and \nresuscitation,  if  necessary.”138  And  the  agency  instructed  women  to  take  the \nmedication guide with them “[w]hen [they] visit an emergency room.”139 \n221.  In its 2016 denial of the 2002 Citizen Petition, the FDA said it would \ncontinue to rely on emergency rooms as a backstop to “ensure that women have access \nto medical facilities for emergency care” to manage the expected complications.140 \n222.  The agency did the same in its 2021 petition denial, noting prescribers \nwere required to “ensure that mifepristone is prescribed [only] to women for whom \nemergency care is available.”141 And prescribers were not themselves required to be \nable to treat life-threatening complications, just “assure patient access to medical \nfacilities equipped to provide blood transfusions and resuscitation.”142 Recognizing \n                                            \n135 Ex. 45, Letter from Danco Labs. to Emergency Room Doctors 1 (Nov. 12, 2004) \nhttps://perma.cc/734R-LLSQ. \n136 Id. \n137 Ex. 21, 2011 REMS at 5. \n138 Id. at 1, 7. \n139 Id. at 4. \n140 Ex. 22, 2016 Petition Denial at 21. \n141 Ex. 34, 2021 FDA Response at 39. \n142 Id. at 9. \n52 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 195-1   Filed 10/11/24    Page 53 of 199   PageID 9350\nthat this care would frequently come from emergency rooms, the FDA observed that \n“[i]t is common practice for healthcare providers to provide emergency care coverage \nfor  other  healthcare  providers’  patients,  and  in  many  places,  hospitals  employ \n‘hospitalists’ to provide care to all hospitalized patients.”143 \n223.  In evaluating mail-order dispensing, the FDA relied on five studies. In \none, “7 percent of participants had clinical encounters in [emergency department \n(ED)]/urgent care centers.”144 In another, “6 percent of participants had unplanned \nclinical encounters in ED/urgent care,” and “[s]urgical interventions were required in \n4.1 percent to complete abortion.”145 A third study revealed that “12.5 percent had an \nunplanned clinical encounter.”146 In the fourth study, 5.8 percent in the “telemedicine \nplus mail group” had “ED visits,” which was almost three times higher than “the in-\nperson  group.”147  And  the  last  study  had  “significant  limitations”  because \n“investigators were unable to verify the outcomes” and “the study’s design did not \ncapture all serious safety concerns.”148 \n224.  Finally, the FDA’s current label for mifepristone also directs women to \nemergency rooms if one of many adverse events arises.149 It says that an estimated \n2.9 to 4.6 percent of women will visit the emergency room after taking mifepristone \n                                            \n143 Id. at 12. \n144 Ex. 34, 2021 FDA Response at 32. \n145 Id. \n146 Id. at 32–33. \n147 Id. at 33. \n148 Id. at 34. \n149 Supra note 7, Mifeprex 2023 Label at 2. \n53 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 195-1   Filed 10/11/24    Page 54 of 199   PageID 9351\non the label.150 That’s roughly one in 25 women who will end up in the emergency \nroom if they take abortion drugs as directed.  \n225.  The use of emergency rooms to treat abortion harms was a predictable \nconsequence  of  removing  safeguards  around  Mifepristone.151  For  example,  the \npredictable  consequence  of  removing  the  requirement  that  physicians  dispense \nabortion drugs is the “explosion of Mifeprex complications including hemorrhage.”152 \nXVII. Defendants’ actions seek to undermine state abortion laws and state \nlaw enforcement. \n226.  Defendants’ actions undermine state abortion laws and frustrate state \nlaw enforcement.   \n227.  By removing REMS restrictions, the FDA fostered the creation of out-\nof-state  abortion  drug  markets—and  it  facilitated  the  creation  of  abortion-drug \nmarkets that operate by mail, common carrier, and interactive computer service.  \n228.  The FDA loosened the prior safeguards that prevented mifepristone \nfrom being mailed to any state or being dispensed other than in-person.  \n229.  The FDA has done nothing to prevent mifepristone from being mailed to \nany particular state, regardless of federal or state law.  \n230.  Evading state abortion laws has been the FDA’s overarching regulatory \npurpose for mifepristone—even at the cost of harm to women’s health and safety. \n231.  When the FDA began its approval and regulation of abortion drugs, the \nagency admitted that the reason to approve mifepristone was to undermine state \nabortion laws. Ruth B. Merkatz, PhD, RN, FAAN served as the Director of the Office \nof Women’s Health from 1994-1996, and later became a director at the Population \n                                            \n150 Id. at 8. \n151 Ex. 4, Harrison Compl.

In her oral history of the approval of mifepristone, she explained the FDA’s \nintent to use mifepristone to evade state abortion laws: “It was really a revolutionary \ndecade in the ‘90s. We knew RU-486 was going to be very important especially in \nstates where surgical abortions are not permitted. And if they overturn Roe v. Wade, \nit’s going to be really important. What’s interesting if you look through the panels in \nthis program [referring to conference program], these are the topics that I thought \nwere important to discuss. This is in 1994. It includes a panel on RU-486.”153   \n232.  A letter to the FDA in 2016 signed by 30 pro-abortion organizations \nstated, “[a]lthough the FDA may have decided 15 years ago that the balance of risk \nand  burden  came  out  in  favor  of  restricting  mifepristone’s  indicated  use  and \ndistribution, today both science and the current conditions surrounding patient access \nto abortion care call strongly for a reevaluation of the mifepristone label and REMS \nrestrictions, especially its Elements to Assure Safe Use (ETASU).” 154 The letter urged \nthe FDA to “[c]onsider the current legal and social climate,” explaining that “[t]he \noverall legal and social climate around abortion care intensifies all of the burdens \nthat the mifepristone REMS places on patients and makes it even more critical that \nthe FDA lift medically unnecessary restrictions on the drug.”155 \n233.  Early  in  the  Biden-Harris  administration,  Vice  President  Kamala \nHarris promised that the administration would “fight to protect access” to abortion156 \n                                            \n153  FDA,  Oral  History  Interview  with  Ruth  B.

The President tasked HHS and the Department of Justice (DOJ) to \nexplore steps to “ensure access to safe and legal abortion.”158 Officials were to “use \nevery lever at their disposal to ensure … access” for “every woman … across the \ncountry.”159   \n235.  HHS would be a key part of this “whole-of-government approach.”160 \nHHS was “to look for ways to make sure we are providing access to healthcare to \nwomen”  and  the  FDA  would  make  a  decision  about  lifting  the  REMS  on \nmifepristone.161 \n236.

In response, President Biden called Dobbs “an extreme decision”162 by \n“not a normal Court.”163   \n238.  Rather than wait for Congress to heed his call to codify Roe v. Wade, \nPresident Biden “committed to doing everything in his power” to “protect access” to \nabortion.164 He noted, “Some states are saying that they’ll try to ban or severely \nrestrict access to these medications.”165   \n239.  So he issued multiple executive orders mandating access to abortion.166  \n240.  The day Dobbs was issued, “[i]n the face of threats from state officials \nsaying they will try to ban or severely restrict access to medication for reproductive \nhealth care, the President directed the Secretary of Health and Human Services to \nidentify all ways to ensure that mifepristone is as widely accessible as possible in \nlight of the FDA’s determination that the drug is safe and effective—including when \nprescribed  through  telehealth  and  sent  by  mail.”167  President  Biden  specifically \n                                            \n162 White House, Remarks by President Biden Before Meeting with His Task Force \non Reproductive Healthcare Access (Jan. 22, 2024), https://perma.cc/N9KR-TKX9. \n163 White House, Remarks by President Biden on the Supreme Court’s Decision on \nAffirmative Action (June 29, 2023), https://perma.cc/7XU8-3KL4. \n164 White House, FACT SHEET: President Biden to Sign Executive Order Protecting \nAccess to Reproductive Health Care Services (July 8, 2022), https://perma.cc/F5ZZ-\nXGL8. \n165 White House, Remarks by President Biden on the Supreme Court Decision to \nOverturn Roe v.

The  same  day,  Secretary  Becerra  accordingly  announced  HHS’s \n“commitment to ensure every American has access to … medication abortion” and \npromised, “we will double down and use every lever we have to protect access to \nabortion.”169 \n242.  Secretary Becerra explained in a written statement, “At the Department \nof Health and Human Services, we stand unwavering in our commitment to ensure \nevery American has access to health care and the ability to make decisions about \nhealth care -- including the right to safe and legal abortion, such as medication \nabortion that has been approved by the FDA for over 20 years. I have directed every \npart of my Department to do any and everything we can here. As I have said before, \nwe will double down and use every lever we have to protect access to abortion care.”170  \n243.

President  Biden’s  then  issued  a  follow-up  executive  order  again \ndirecting HHS “to protect and expand access to abortion care, including medication \nabortion.”172  \n245.  In due course, HHS promoted “access” to abortion drugs through the \nFDA REMS process. In section 1 of its post-Dobbs “action plan,” entitled “Access to \nMedication Abortion and Contraception,” HHS said that “HHS will continue its work \nto protect access to FDA-regulated products for abortion that have been found to be \nsafe and effective.” It continued, the “FDA will continue the REMS modification \nprocess and review the applicants’ proposed changes to the REMS related to removing \nthe in-person dispensing requirement.”173  \n246.  After the FDA modified the REMS for mifepristone, HHS issued a report \ncalled Marking the 50th Anniversary of Roe: Biden-Harris Administration Efforts to \nProtect Reproductive Health Care. In this report, HHS identified the January 2023 \nREMS change as one of the actions HHS took since Dobbs to protect access to \nabortion.174  In  an  accompanying  press  release,  HHS  highlighted  the  FDA’s \n                                            \n172 Exec.

As Secretary Becerra explained shortly thereafter, “We’re using our \nauthority as well to secure reproductive health care access for every American who \nneeds it—wherever they are, whenever they need it.”176  \n248.  The White House likewise identified the FDA’s 2023 permanent removal \nof the in-person dispensing protection as an action taken in response to President \nBiden’s July 8, 2022 executive order directing HHS to “protect and expand access to \nabortion care, including medication abortion.”177 \n249.  Another part of the White House’s whole-of-government response to \nDobbs included enlisting DOJ in support of HHS’s actions to undermine state laws \nby creating a 50-state mail-order abortion economy.  \n250.  When  Dobbs  was  decided,  Attorney  General  Merrick  Garland,  the \nnation’s chief law enforcement officer and head of DOJ, promised that DOJ will “work \ntirelessly to protect and advance” abortion and will “use every tool at our disposal.” \n                                            \n175 Press Release, HHS, HHS Releases Report Detailing Biden-Harris Administration \nEfforts  to  Protect  Reproductive  Health  Care  Since  Dobbs  (Jan.  19,  2023), \nhttps://perma.cc/6CE3-J7DD. \n176 Press Release, HHS, HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra Urges Nation to Shift from \nan  “Illness-Care  System”  to  a  “Wellness-Care  System”  at  National  Press  Club \nLuncheon (Feb. 9, 2024), https://perma.cc/R9SF-3VKC. \n177  White  House,  FACT  SHEET:  The  Biden-Harris  Administration’s  Record  on \nProtecting Access to Medication Abortion (Apr. 12, 2023), https://perma.cc/78TT-\n3J2G (citing Exec.

HHS soon reported that it had been working with DOJ “to help ensure \naccess to care and preserve [the] FDA’s role in determining what is safe and effective \nfor patients.”179 HHS said that, “The Attorney General of the United States made \nclear that states may not ban mifepristone based on disagreement with [the] FDA’s \nexpert judgment about its safety and efficacy.”180 These announcements came in a \nformal HHS report entitled Secretary’s Report Health Care Under Attack: An Action \nPlan to Protect and Strengthen Reproductive Care, in a section entitled Federal \nPreemption—Protecting Access to Medication Abortion \n252.  Later, the White House confirmed that this purported preemption was \nanother step that “the Biden-Harris Administration has taken…to protect access to \nmedication abortion.”181 “[P]reserving access” to abortion drugs, the White House \nreiterated, is “one of two key priorities” after Dobbs.182  \nXVIII.  The FDA actions created a 50-state abortion drug mailing economy, \nundermining state abortion laws. \n253.  Defendants’ actions had their predictable and intended effect.  \n254.

Second, the FDA’s 2021/2023 actions removed all in-person dispensing \nprotections and enabled the creation of out-of-state abortion-drug distributors that \ndispense FDA-approved drugs by mail, common carrier, and interactive computer \nservice—all to evade state abortion laws.  \n256.  These actions caused a nationwide increase in chemical abortions, the \nwidespread taking of abortion drugs up to 10 weeks of pregnancy, and the resulting \ncascading medical complications for women.  \nA.  Defendants’ deregulatory actions resulted in women receiving \nabortion  drugs  out-of-state  and  returning  home  to  Plaintiff \nStates with no continuous in-person care.  \n257.  The FDA’s actions enabled abortion providers to dispense abortion drugs \nto  residents  of  Plaintiff  States later in  pregnancy  and  without  follow-up  care—\ncausing  women  to  seek  emergency  services  in  Plaintiff  States  for  treatment  of \nresulting complications. \n258.  This is confirmed by another case concerning the 2016 and 2023 REMS, \nWhole Woman’s Health Alliance v. FDA, in which abortion providers in Virginia, \nMontana, and Kansas confirmed that they now dispense abortion drugs to residents \nof Plaintiff States who travel to them outside of Plaintiff States and then leave follow-\nup care to Plaintiff States’ emergency providers—all because the FDA enabled these \nabortion providers not to provide continuous follow-up care or three in-person doctor \nvisits.183  \n                                            \n183 Ex. 47, Complaint, ECF No. 1, Whole Woman’s Health All. v. FDA, No. 3:23-cv-\n00019-NKM, ¶1 (W.D. Va. May 8, 2023) (hereinafter Whole Woman’s Health Compl.) \nThis  complaint  is  supported  by  sworn  declarations  from  the  plaintiff  abortion \nproviders. See Ex. 48, Rebecca Tong Decl., ECF No. 10-1, Whole Woman’s Health All. \nv. FDA, No. 3:23-cv-00019-NKM (W.D. Va. May 8, 2023) (hereinafter Tong Decl.); Ex. \n62 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 195-1   Filed 10/11/24    Page 63 of 199   PageID 9360\n259.  Each provider in Whole Woman’s Health Alliance v. FDA uses both \nDanco’s Mifeprex and GenBioPro’s generic mifepristone.184 One of those providers, \nTrust Women, spent $20,000 on brand name mifepristone alone in early 2023.185  \n260.  These abortion providers dispense FDA-approved drugs to women from \nPlaintiff States in order to evade state abortion laws. These providers have made \nwhat they describe as “herculean efforts to provide” abortion drugs “not only for \nresidents of their states, but also for the thousands of patients forced to travel \nhundreds of miles for basic healthcare from the 13 states and counting where abortion \nis now banned, and the many others where it remains severely restricted.”186  \n261.  The FDA’s decision to remove follow-up visit protections enabled Whole \nWoman’s Health (WWH), an abortion provider with locations across the country and \nin Virginia, to provide abortion drugs in one state and then leave follow-up care to \nemergency medical professionals in other states.  \n262.  For  example,  WWH  of  Alexandria  provides  FDA-approved  abortion \ndrugs up to 11 weeks to many women from Plaintiff States with no in-person follow-\nup visits.187 “Because WWH of Alexandria is close to a large airport, many of our \npatients travel to us by plane from states where abortion [is] banned ...

Another of these providers, Trust Women, operates a clinic in Wichita, \nKansas that has provided abortion drugs since it opened in 2013 and that currently \nprovides abortion drugs up to 11 weeks.189 The clinic has “18 doctors, and 16 of them \nfly in to Kansas to provide care.”190 In 2021, almost half of its patients received FDA-\napproved abortion drugs as their method of abortion.191  \n264.  As the provider explained, Trust Women Wichita “experienced a huge \nsurge in patients seeking care following” the Dobbs decision.192 In 2022, the Kansas \nclinic saw patients start coming from hundreds of miles away.193 “Trust Women \nWichita, as one of the few remaining clinics somewhat close to Texas, Oklahoma, and \nother ban states, has seen a massive increase in patients seeking care due to abortion \nbans.194 Specifically, “In 2021, Trust Women Wichita saw around 1500 patients. In \n2022, we saw around 3500 patients. For the first 4 months of 2023, we have seen 2000 \npatients already—on pace for 6,000 for the year. Around two-thirds of our patients \nare coming from out of state.”195 Since Texas’s abortion law “S.B. 8 took effect, it is \nnot uncommon for us to receive tens of thousands of calls a day.”196  \n                                            \n188 Id. ¶ 19 (emphasis added). \n189 Tong Decl. ¶¶ 1, 6. \n190 Id. ¶ 30. \n191 Id. ¶ 35. \n192 Whole Woman’s Health Compl. ¶ 103. \n193 Tong Decl. ¶ 19. \n194 Id.¶ 19. \n195 Id. ¶ 19. \n196 Id. ¶ 21. \n64 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 195-1   Filed 10/11/24    Page 65 of 199   PageID 9362\n265.  Montana’s Blue Mountain Clinic likewise considers itself and Montana \nto be “a critical site of access to abortion for people in the greater Northern Rockies \nand Plains regions” as “access” in other states “has grown exponentially worse” since \nDobbs.197  Each  of  Montana’s  neighboring  states—North  Dakota,  South  Dakota, \nWyoming,  and  Idaho—restrict  abortion.198  And  “[a]bout  25%  of  Blue  Mountain \nClinic’s patients travel more than 50 miles” for abortions. Smith Decl. ¶10. Blue \nMountain Clinic provides FDA-approved abortion drugs up to 10 weeks of pregnancy \nto patients physically present in Montana.199 In 2022, “Blue Mountain Clinic provided \nabout 400 abortions. Almost 40% of those abortions were for patients who are insured \nthrough Medicaid (which covers abortion care in Montana).”200  \n266.  All these providers send women from Plaintiff States home without \nongoing care or in-person follow-up visits for abortion drug complications.  \n267.  The FDA’s lack of required in-person follow-up visits results in women \ntraveling across the country to pick up abortion drugs from these providers (and many \nmore like them) before returning home to complete the abortion regimen—leaving \nwomen to seek emergency care in Plaintiff States for the inevitable complications.  \n268.  These abortion providers—the WWH entities, Blue Mountain Clinic, All \nFamilies, and Trust Women Wichita continue to provide abortion drugs in-person to \nthis day.  \n269.  In  another  case,  Washington  v.  FDA,  abortion  providers  similarly \nexplained in sworn declarations how their use of abortion drugs under Defendants’ \n                                            \n197 Smith Decl. ¶ 7. \n198 Id. ¶ 7. \n199 Id. ¶ 13. \n200 Id. ¶ 15. \n65 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 195-1   Filed 10/11/24    Page 66 of 199   PageID 9363\nactions have enabled them to evade state laws and leave follow-up care to Plaintiff \nStates.201  \n270.  Cedar  River  Clinic  in  Renton,  Seattle,  Tacoma,  and  Yakima, \nWashington provides abortion drugs to residents and non-residents.202 This clinic is \n“only one of a small handful of full-service abortion clinics in Eastern Washington,” \nnear the Idaho border.203 FDA-approved abortion drugs “make up approximately 40% \nof all the abortions Cedar River Clinics perform.” Cantrell Decl. ¶10. The clinic \nprovides abortion drugs in clinic and via telemedicine to “those traveling from out of \nstate or internationally.”204  \n271.  As Cedar River Clinic explained, “Many of those patients had to travel \ndue to restrictive laws. Since the Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization \ndecision  in  June  2022  and  subsequent  abortion  bans,  Cedar  River  Clinics  are \nexperiencing a rising tide in the volume of individuals coming to Washington from \nother states to seek an abortion. It is not limited to our region; we are serving patients \nfrom across the country especially the South and Midwest who are being impacted by \nthe abortion bans in their states.”205  \n272.  In  this  case,  Washington  v.  FDA,  Planned  Parenthood  of  Greater \nWashington and Northern Idaho (PPGWNI) likewise explained how the current FDA \nREMS enables it to provide FDA-approved abortion drugs to Idaho and other out-of-\n                                            \n201 Washington v.

PPGWNI historically has provided abortion drugs to Idaho residents \nand since 2022 has had an increase in other out-of-state residents seeking abortion \ndrugs. As the provider explained, “With three of our clinics (Spokane, Spokane Valley, \nand Pullman) so close to the border, PPGWNI has long seen patients from Idaho. But \nsince Dobbs, we have seen a significant increase in out-of-state patients.”210 “In \nJanuary 2023, PPGWNI saw an increase of 25% in total abortion patient visits \ncompared to January 2022. We saw a 75% increase in Idaho patients from January \n2023 compared to January 2022.”211 “This includes a 36% increase for procedural \nabortion patient visits and 90% increase for medication abortion visits from Idaho.”212 \n“In our Pullman clinic, we now have an outright majority of patients—53% in 2022 \nand likely higher in 2023—coming from Idaho.”213 “This is up from 39% in 2021.”214 \n“Further, with the closure of PPGWNI’s Boise clinic, we have started to see an influx \n                                            \n206 Ex. 53, Declaration of Paul Dillon, ECF 4-1, Ex. 5, Washington v.

In  the  same  case,  Washington  v.  FDA,  the  Washington  State \nDepartment of Health confirmed that Washington abortion providers like Cedar \nRiver Clinic and PPGWNI dispense abortions to non-Washington residents.218 “In \n2021, there were 15,968 abortions among Washington residents” and “998 abortions \nwere provided to non-residents who traveled from out of state.”219 “Non-residents \nseeking abortion care in Washington came from 41 states, as well as Guam and \nCanada,  with  the  majority  coming  from  Idaho  (406),  Oregon  (330),  and  Alaska \n(51).”220 Abortion sites “in the eastern and southern parts of Washington are most \nlikely to serve patients from Idaho and Oregon respectively based on geographic \nlocation.”221 “In 2021, 59% of the abortions provided in Washington were medication \nabortions.”222  \n275.  Cedar River Clinic and PPGWNI continue to dispense abortion drugs in \nperson to this day.  \n                                            \n215 Id. ¶ 12. \n216 Id. \n217 Id. ¶ 13. \n218 Ex. 54, Declaration of Cynthia Harris, ECF 4-1, Ex. 10, Washington v.

Other abortion providers confirm that they provide abortion drugs to \nwomen from Plaintiff States in single appointments—without three doctor visits or \nother in-person follow-up care. For example, Emily Wales, CEO and president of \nPlanned Parenthood Great Plains, said, “In a matter of months [after Dobbs], we \nstarted serving patients from Texas and Arkansas and Oklahoma … Missourians had \nto really compete for too few appointments” for abortion drugs.223  \n277.  The FDA’s actions removing the protection of three doctor visits enabled \nthese abortion providers to provide abortion drugs to so many women—and enabled \nthem to redirect all emergency care to Plaintiff States.  \n278.  Without these prior FDA safeguards, these providers have increased \ntheir in-person provision of abortion drugs since 2016 (surging after Dobbs) which \nincreases complications for women from Plaintiff States.  \nB.  Defendants’ removal of any doctor safeguards also contributed \nto  women  receiving  abortion  drugs  out-of-state  and  then \nreturning home with no continuous in-person follow-up care.  \n279.  The removal of the safeguard of a doctor prescriber for FDA-approved \nabortion drugs was likewise a key step in allowing them to be dispensed to women in \none state while leaving follow-up care to the woman’s home state.  \n280.  Three of the plaintiff providers in Whole Woman’s Health v. FDA (Whole \nWoman’s Health, Blue Mountain Clinic, and All Families) employ advanced practice \nclinicians (APCs) to provide chemical abortion drugs.224  \n                                            \n223 Ex. 55, Anna Spoerre, 2 Years After Missouri Banned Abortion, Navigating Access \nStill  Involves  Fear,  Confusion,  Missouri  Independent  (June  24,  2024), \nhttps://missouriindependent.com/2024/06/24/2-year-anniversary-missouri-abortion-\nban/. \n224 Whole Woman’s Health Compl. ¶ 101; Miller Decl. ¶ 18; Smith Decl. ¶ 31. \n69 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 195-1   Filed 10/11/24    Page 70 of 199   PageID 9367\n281.  WWH of Alexandria employs a nurse practitioner to dispense abortion \ndrugs in-clinic, and it employed other advanced practice clinicians in the past.225 The \nclinic estimates that its “nurse practitioners have provided around 1,500 medication \nabortions, which is more than 40% of the total medication abortions.”226  \n282.  WWH  of  Alexandria  credits  the  FDA’s  removal  of  the  prior  doctor \nprotections for its ability to provide more abortions. WWH of Alexandria “only has \nphysicians  providing  abortion  Thursday  through  Saturday,  so  employing  APCs \nallows the clinic to offer abortions for the rest of the week and frees up clinic space \nand  resources  for  later  abortion  cases  over  the  weekend.”227  Reinstating  the \nphysician-only certified prescriber requirement would complicate WWH’s operations \nand recruiting of APCs...”228  \n283.  One provider in Montana, All Families (which is close to the border with \nIdaho) says that this FDA deregulation is the only way that it can provide abortion \ndrugs. “In the case of All Families, the sole clinician prescribing and providing \nabortion is an advanced practice clinician. Reinstating the REMS’ physician-only \nrequirement  for  certified  prescribers  will  thus  eliminate  the  sole  mifepristone \nprovider from the northwest region of Montana.”229 In Montana the next closest \nprovider, Blue Mountain Clinic, is a three-hour drive away.230  \n                                            \n225 Miller Decl. ¶ 18. \n226 Id. ¶ 18. \n227 Id. ¶ 36. “ \n228 Id. ¶ 37. \n229 Whole Woman’s Health Compl. ¶ 102; Weems Decl. ¶¶ 1–2. \n230 Weems Decl. ¶¶ 25, 28; Smith Decl. ¶ 33. \n70 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 195-1   Filed 10/11/24    Page 71 of 199   PageID 9368\n284.  All Families provides abortion drugs up to 11 weeks of pregnancy.231 In \n2022, it provided approximately 260 abortions, and providing abortion drugs “makes \nup well over half” of these abortions.232 The next year, abortion drugs made up \n“between 65% and 90%” of total monthly abortions in 2023 at All Families.233  \n285.  For All Families, restoring the pre-2016 REMS would be “devastating” \nfor its operations.234 Reinstating “the physician-only certified prescriber requirement \nwould  mean  [it]  could  no  longer  prescribe  mifepristone.”235  “Advanced  practice \nclinicians have been critical to maintaining or restoring access to abortion in this \nregion—including access to mifepristone—and this requirement would once again cut \noff that access.”236  \n286.  At Blue Mountain Clinic, two physician assistants likewise dispense \nabortion drugs, and Blue Mountain Clinic brought suit to maintain this status quo.237  \n287.  The other providers in Whole Woman’s Health Alliance v. FDA similarly \nseek to use non-doctors to provide abortion drugs. WWH of Charlottesville does not \ncurrently  have  any  advanced  practice  clinicians  providing  abortion  care  but  is \nactively recruiting for such providers.238 Trust Women in Kansas likewise “would \nwant to use advanced practice clinicians to mail chemical abortion drugs if they are \nultimately able to start their telehealth program.”239  \n                                            \n231 Weems Decl. ¶ 6. \n232 Id. \n233 Id. \n234 Id. ¶ 24. \n235 Id. ¶ 25. \n236 Id. ¶ 26. \n237 Smith Decl. ¶ 31. \n238 Miller Decl. ¶ 11. \n239 Whole Woman’s Health Compl. ¶ 101; Tong Decl. ¶ 27.  \n71 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 195-1   Filed 10/11/24    Page 72 of 199   PageID 9369\n288.  The FDA’s actions directly led to the ability of these abortion providers \nto dispense abortion drugs or to dispense more abortion drugs to women from Plaintiff \nStates, and the FDA’s action directly increased harm to women and girls.  \nC.  The FDA’s pharmacy deregulation likewise leads to abortions \nwith no in-person follow-up care.   \n289.  Defendants’  pharmacy  dispensing  deregulation  also  has  major \nimplications for Plaintiff States. This action also enabled abortion providers in other \nStates to dispense abortion drugs (or dispense more abortion drugs) to women from \nPlaintiff States and then send them home for follow-up care in Plaintiff States.  \n290.  The FDA’s permission for pharmacies to dispense abortion drugs led \nmajor pharmacy chains to start stocking abortion drugs in many states—without \nproviding in-person follow-up care.  \n291.  Walgreens and CVS each swiftly announced that they “will sell the \nprescription abortion pill mifepristone after the Food and Drug Administration this \nweek dropped a long-standing rule that prevented drug stores from doing so.”240 As \none article explained, “This means patients in many parts of the U.S. will effectively \nbe able to obtain mifepristone like other prescription medications, either in-person at \na retail pharmacy or through the mail.”241 In early 2024, both “major pharmacy \nchains CVS and Walgreens announced they had been certified to begin dispensing \nmifepristone at select locations in states where abortion is legal.”242  \n                                            \n240 Ex. 56, Spencer Kimball & Bertha Coombs, CVS and Walgreens Plan to Sell \nAbortion Pill Mifepristone at Pharmacies after FDA Rule Change, CNBC (Jan. 5 \n2023),  https://www.cnbc.com/2023/01/05/abortion-cvs-and-walgreens-will-sell-\nmifepristone-in-pharmacies.html.  \n241 Id.  \n242 Ex. 57, Patrick Adams, In Washington State, Pharmacists are Poised to Start \nPrescribing  Abortion  Drugs,  NPR  (March  1,  2024), \n72 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 195-1   Filed 10/11/24    Page 73 of 199   PageID 9370\n292.

Another  national  pharmacy  dispensing  abortion  drugs  is  Honeybee \nHealth,  which  GenBioPro  reports  provides  abortion  drugs  by  mail  “in  multiple \nstates.”245  \n295.

This will likely increase \nfurther the number of women with no follow-up care who seek emergency services in \nPlaintiff States.  \n297.  In fact, in Washington, pharmacists “go a step further than that” and \n“pharmacists  themselves  [now]  prescribe  the  abortion  medication,  without  a \nphysician.”248 In Washington, “efforts are underway to open up access to medication \nabortion in a radical new way: by training pharmacists not only to dispense abortion \npills but also to prescribe them to their walk-in patients.”249 NPR reports that “[t]here \nare 10 pharmacists in the first cohort,” expected to start prescribing in early 2024.250  \n298.  Without  the  FDA’s  in-person  dispensing  protection  or  without  any \ndoctor  safeguards,  a  pharmacist  in  Washington  can  now  conduct  a  telehealth \nappointment with an Idaho resident in Washington and prescribe mifepristone. As \nNPR concludes, “Pharmacist prescribing of mifepristone puts the drug a step closer \nto over-the-counter.”251  \n                                            \n247 Id.  \n248 Ex. 57, Patrick Adams, In Washington State, Pharmacists are Poised to Start \nPrescribing  Abortion  Drugs,  NPR  (March  1,  2024), \nhttps://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2024/01/22/1225703970/pharmacists-\nprescribe-dispense-abortion-pill-mifepristone. \n249 Id.  \n250 Id.  \n251 Id.  \n74 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 195-1   Filed 10/11/24    Page 75 of 199   PageID 9372\n299.  The new ability of pharmacists to prescribe and dispense abortion drugs \nshows how women from Plaintiff States will be harmed by the FDA’s actions and seek \nfollow-up care from providers at home.  \nD.  Defendants’ actions resulted in the creation of a 50-state mail-\norder abortion-drug economy.  \n300.  Lifting any in-person dispensing protections —no matter the risk to \nwomen’s health and safety—was the final step in the FDA’s plan to limit any effect \nfrom Dobbs and undermine state abortion laws.  \n301.  Removing the in-person dispensing protections enabled a 50-state mail-\norder abortion drug economy—a world where countless women in Plaintiff States \nreceive abortion drugs by mail later in pregnancy with no in-person care and go the \nemergency room in Plaintiffs’ States.  \n302.  According to one report, in less than a month after Dobbs was decided, \nseven U.S.-based providers mailed approximately 3,500 doses of mifepristone and its \ngeneric equivalent to states that prohibit the use of abortion drugs.252  \n303.  Eight States have embraced Defendants’ actions and passed “shield” \nlaws expressly seeking to facilitate these providers conducting out-of-state mail-order \nabortions and to prevent Plaintiff States from enforcing their own laws.253 \n                                            \n252 Ex. 60, Rachel Roubein, ‘Shield’ Laws Make it Easier to Send Abortion Pills to \nBanned  States,  Wash.

These shield laws often explicitly name mifepristone and the proponents \nof those laws openly proclaim that they seek to abrogate the sovereignty of Plaintiff \nStates.254 \n1.  Aid Access  \n305.  Many abortion providers, like Aid Access, have explained to the press \nhow Defendants’ actions have enabled them to frustrate state abortion restrictions \nand mail FDA-approved abortion drugs “to people in all 50 states, even those [like \nMissouri] that have banned it.”255 \n306.  Mailing FDA-approved abortion drugs is new for Aid Access. In the past, \nAid Access did not mail FDA-approved abortion drugs.  \n307.  When Aid Access was started in 2018, it operated as a black-market \nprovider  of  abortion  drugs  from  India.  “FDA  regulations  prevented  licensed  US \nproviders from mailing mifepristone, one of the two drugs in the medication abortion \nregimen, so Aid Access was structured like … telemedicine service.”256 \n308.  But  then  in  2021  the  “in-person  dispensing  requirement  for \nmifepristone” was removed.257 Aid Access responded to the FDA’s 2021 change by \nentering the U.S. market as a provider of FDA-approved abortion drugs by mail in \ncertain states. “For the first time, legally prescribed medication abortion could be put \nin the mail. Aid Access used this opportunity to implement a hybrid model: in states \n                                            \n254 Id.  \n255 Ex. 62, Rebecca Grant, Group Using ‘Shield Laws’ to Provide Abortion Care in \nStates  That  Ban  It,  The  Guardian  (July  23,  2023), \nhttps://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/23/shield-laws-provide-abortion-care-\naid-access. \n256 Id. \n257 Id. \n76 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 195-1   Filed 10/11/24    Page 77 of 199   PageID 9374\nwhere telemedicine abortion was legal, US clinicians handled the prescriptions, while \nin states where it wasn’t, the pills continued to be mailed from India.”258 \n309.  Later, after the FDA’s 2023 permanent removal of in-person dispensing \nsafeguards,  Aid  Access  expanded  its  scope  and  began  providing  FDA-approved \nabortion drugs by mail to all states.  \n310.  Once some States like New York adopted shield-laws, Aid Access began \nmailing FDA-approved abortion drugs directly from the United States instead of \nblack-market abortion drugs from India.  \n311.  This change transformed the process from “needing to wait three or four \nweeks to get it to happen, and not even be sure if those pills are ever going to come” \nto receiving abortion drugs in the mail in “two-five days.” 259 \n312.  The  FDA’s  decision  not  to  require  in-person  distribution  directly \ncontributed to the decisions of out-of-state companies to mail abortion drugs to people \nin Plaintiff States. People “feel more secure knowing that the pills are coming from \nlicensed clinicians through an FDA-approved pipeline” rather than from India.260 \n313.  In an NBC news story, Dr. Linda Prine, a New York City-based shield \nlaw provider for Aid Access explained the scale of its new FDA-enabled mailing \noperations by mid-2024. “Before we had the shield law, we were mailing pills to the \nblue states, and only [pills from] overseas could be sent to the restricted states.” After \nNew York’s shield law passed, Aid Access began sending FDA-approved abortion \n                                            \n258 Id. \n259 Id. \n260 Id. \n77 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 195-1   Filed 10/11/24    Page 78 of 199   PageID 9375\ndrugs to every state: “the first month we sent about 4,000 pills into restricted states, \nand now we’re up to around 10,000 pills a month.”261 \n314.  Another Aid Access provider, located in “a basement in upstate New \nYork” also “underscored the importance of sending these pills from the U.S., rather \nthan overseas. ‘Sometimes they got stuck in customs,’ the provider explained as more \nthan 100 prescriptions were being packaged around them, preparing to be shipped \ninto states with bans.”262 \n315.  Aid Access moreover benefits from Defendants’ removal of the safeguard \nthat women receive a doctor’s care when receiving FDA-approved abortion drugs. \nAlongside  doctors,  Lauren  Jacobson,  a  nurse  practitioner,  prescribes  abortion \nmedication through Aid Access—helping make Aid Access the largest of the current \nshield law abortion drug providers.263 \n316.  The NBC story provided images of New York’s Aid Access providers \nmailing GenBioPro’s generic mifepristone to women in Plaintiff States—the images \nshow that next to pill bottles and mailing envelopes, these abortion providers have \nstacks of white boxes of mifepristone with GenBioPro’s distinctive purple and pink \ncircular logo.264  \n                                            \n261  Ex.  63,  Abigail  Brooks  and  Dasha  Burns,  How  A  Network  of  Abortion  Pill \nProviders Works Together in the Wake of New Threats, NBC News (April 7, 2024), \nhttps://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/network-abortion-pill-providers-\nworks-together-wake-new-threats-rcna146678.  \n262 Id. \n263 Ex. 64, Elissa Nadworny, Inside a Medical Practice Sending Abortion Pills to \nStates  Where  They’re  Banned,  NPR  (Aug.  7,  2024), \nhttps://www.npr.org/2024/08/06/nx-s1-5037750/abortion-pills-bans-telehealth-mail-\nmifepristone-misoprostol.  \n264 Ex. 63, Abigail Brooks and Dasha Burns, How a Network of Abortion Pill Providers \nWorks  Together  in  the  Wake  of  New  Threats,  NBC  News  (April  7,  2024), \n78 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 195-1   Filed 10/11/24    Page 79 of 199   PageID 9376\nA shield law provider packs abortion pills into envelopes to be sent from New York to \nstates with bans.

Aid Access and Ms. Jacobson interviewed with the Washington Post in \nJune 2023 when they first began their “new pipeline of legally prescribed abortion \npills flowing into states with abortion bans.” This “small group” mailed 3,500 doses \nof FDA-approved abortion drugs in the first month and aimed to “facilitate at least \n42,000 abortions” in its first year.265  \n318.

In another interview with the Washington Post, Dr. Prine said that \n“[a]nxiety  and  uncertainty  are  common  even  among  patients  who  receive  the \nmedication at an abortion clinic in a state where abortion is legal ... because they’re \nat home by the time they start feeling the full effects.”267 “People from anywhere can \nbe freaking out because everyone is taking these pills at home alone.”268 And “[i]n \nstates with abortion bans, the emergency room is often the only option for women \nwho want in-person care during their medication abortions.”269 \n320.  Dr. Prine said that when someone calls her by phone for advice, she tells \nwomen who call concerned about complications “that their experiences are nothing \nout of the ordinary, and that they almost certainly don’t need to go to the emergency \nroom.”270  \n321.  Dr. Prine “said she’s felt the need to send someone to the emergency \nroom only once in nearly five years … ‘Your uterus knows what to do,’ Prine told a \nwoman  who  called  that  January  morning  with  reports  of  unexpectedly  heavy \nbleeding. ‘It’s going to take care of itself.’”271  \n                                            \n266 Id. \n267 Ex. 66, Caroline Kitchener, Alone in a Bathroom: The Fear and Uncertainty of a \nPost-Roe  Medication  Abortion  (April  11,  2024), \nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/interactive/2024/abortion-pill-experience-\nstories/?itid=ap_carolinekitchener. \n268 Id.  \n269 Id.  \n270 Id.  \n271 Id.  \n82 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 195-1   Filed 10/11/24    Page 83 of 199   PageID 9380\n322.  The Washington Post shared Dr. Prine’s comments with other doctors. \nIt reported, “A woman in that situation could have hemorrhaged or become septic, \naccording to five OB/GYNs interviewed for this article.”272  \n323.  Keri Garel, an OB/GYN at Boston Medical Center, said, “Whenever \nthere is something inside the uterus that is trying to come out and won’t come out, \nthe risk of bleeding and infection gets higher with every passing moment,” and so she \nwould advise someone in [this woman’s] situation to go to the hospital immediately. \n“At that point, your life is the most important thing.” \n324.  Aid Access will provide abortion drugs to a woman or girl of any age.273   \n325.  Dr. Prine described how once a “quiet and scared” girl who was 15 years \nold called her from “an area code in a state with an abortion ban” desperate for help \nafter she “had taken pills and passed a fetus larger than she’d expected.” The article \nrelates, “Unable to flush the fetus down the toilet, the girl asked about throwing it \naway.” Dr. Prine’s main response: “There’s nothing in there that’s traceable back to \nyou … As long as you don’t tell anybody.”274 \n326.  Ms. Jacobson conceded to the Washington Post “that this system is far \nfrom perfect.” And she admitted to “occasions her patients in restricted states require \nin-person care” that she would not provide.275  \n327.

The New York Times confirmed that Aid Access provided no in-person \nexams or in-person follow-up care. “Patients contact this service and others online \nand fill out forms providing information about their pregnancy and medical history.… \nPatients and providers can communicate by email or phone if needed.”278  \n330.

MAP does not conduct in-person exams on patients or provide in-person \nfollow-up care. Instead, women “can fill out an online form, connect with a doctor via \nemail or text and, if approved, receive the pills within a week, no matter which state \nthey live in.”288 MAP’s review of a woman’s online submission can occur “within an \nhour” and the whole process can take only three hours before MAP mails the abortion \ndrugs at the post office. 289 Occasionally some women “talk by phone with [Dr. Angel] \nFoster or a prescriber.”290 \n339.

Abuzz  \n350.  A third similar shield-law service is Abuzz, which serves some states \nwith abortion bans.304  \n351.  Abuzz  provides  abortion  drugs  to  Missouri,  Idaho,  and  Kansas \naddresses, and it mails to every State except Texas, Mississippi, Alabama, and \nGeorgia.305 It provides abortion drugs through 10 weeks of pregnancy and beyond.306 \n352.  Abuzz’s website states that it does not provide in-person care. Instead, \nAbuzz says, “In most cases, providers do not require a phone call or video visit. After \nyou fill in the form, a clinician will arrange payment with you and review your \ninformation. If you’re approved to receive abortion pills by mail, your pills will be \nshipped out in 1-2 business days.”307 “Your FDA-approved medications (mifepristone \nand misoprostol) will be sent by mail.”308 \n353.  On  its  FAQs  page,  Abuzz  advises  patients  that  they  need  not  tell \nemergency room doctors that they have taken abortion drugs. In response to the \nquestion, “If I have to go to the hospital, what should I say?” Abuzz says, “The \ntreatment for a miscarriage and abortion are the same, so you can just say something \nlike ‘I’m bleeding but it doesn’t feel like my usual period.

A fourth major shield-law provider is Armadillo Clinic.310 Plan C \nreports that Armadillo Clinic provides abortion drugs to women aged 18+.311   \n355.  On its website, Armadillo Clinic says it “specializes in abortion pills by \ntelemedicine” and, after a patient fills out a ten-minute form, the clinic will “send \nabortion pills confidentially by mail, in 2-5 days.”312 \n356.  Armadillo Clinic does not provide in-person exams or follow-up care. \nInstead, it provides patients with “information you need to manage the process, \nstart to finish,” and its providers will only answer questions “by live chat or \nphone.”313  \n5.  We Take Care of Us \n357.  A fifth provider of FDA-approved abortion drugs is We Take Care of Us.  \n358.  Plan C reports that We Take Care of Us will provide abortion drugs to a \nwoman or girl of any age.314   \n                                            \n309 Ex. 71, Abuzz, FAQs, https://www.abuzzhealth.com/faqs/ \n310 Ex. 72, Shira Stein, Thousands of Out-of-State Abortion Seekers Rely on Two Dozen \nDoctors from Telehealth Shield States, San Francisco Chronicle (June 12, 2024), \nhttps:/www.sfchronicle.com/politics/article/telehealth-abortion-providers-california-\n19508548.php.  \n311 Ex. 67, Plan C, Texas, https://www.plancpills.org/abortion-pill/texas#telehealth.  \n312 Ex. 73, Armadillo Clinic, https://www.armadilloclinic.org/.  \n313 Id.  \n314 Ex. 67, Plan C, Texas, https://www.plancpills.org/abortion-pill/texas#telehealth.  \n95 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 195-1   Filed 10/11/24    Page 96 of 199   PageID 9393\n359.  We Take Care of Us describes itself as “a cooperative run by Certified \nNurse  Midwives  (CNMs),”  indicating  that  the  FDA’s  removal  of  any  doctor \ninvolvement has enabled this platform.315  \n360.  We Take Care of Us tells patients that a “video visit is not required” and \nso it offers to communicate by “secure messaging app, text and email.”316 We Take \nCare of Us requires only a “10-15 minute online intake request.”317  \n361.  We Take Care of Us accepts  payment by Venmo and “can arrange \nshipment to any U.S. state, Guam, Puerto Rico and APO addresses.”318  \n6.  The effect on Plaintiff States \n362.  These providers send abortion drugs to Plaintiff States by mail, common \ncarrier, and interactive computer service.  \n363.  The website Plan C lists websites that will ship FDA-approved abortion \ndrugs to Plaintiff States. Plan C says, “Abortion access in Missouri is restricted, but \nabortion pills are still available by mail from providers outside of Missouri. Options \nbelow.”319 Under a section entitled, “How people get abortion pills in Missouri,” Plan \nC  lists  six  abortion  drug  providers  who  provide  “FDA-approved  medications,” \ndescribing each as “online clinics that mail pills.”  \n364.  Plan C identifies as providers of FDA-approved abortion drugs Abuzz, \nAid Access, Armadillo Clinic, Cambridge Reproductive Health Consultants (MAP), \nWe Take Care of Us, and A Safe Choice.320 In addition, Plan C specifically notes that \n                                            \n315 Ex. 74, We Take Care of Us, FAQs, https://www.wetakecareof.us/faqs. \n316 Id. \n317 Ex. 74a, We Take Care of Us, Care, https://www.wetakecareof.us/care. \n318 Id. \n319 Ex. 75, Plan C, Missouri, https://www.plancpills.org/abortion-pill/missouri.  \n320 Id.  \n96 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 195-1   Filed 10/11/24    Page 97 of 199   PageID 9394\nAid Access’s abortion drugs “are prescribed by clinicians licensed in the US and the \nFDA-approved abortion pills are mailed to all states.”321   \n365.  Of these six providers, Abuzz and MAP will mail FDA-approved abortion \ndrugs to Missouri residents aged 16+.322  \n366.  Plan C identifies Abuzz, Aid Access, MAP, We Take Care of Us, and A \nSafe Choice as “online clinics that mail pills” to Idaho323 and Kansas residents, and \nit also identifies Abortion on Demand as a provider for Kansas residents.324 Abuzz \nand MAP will mail FDA-approved abortion drugs to Idaho and Kansas residents aged \n16+.325 \n367.  The FDA has thus facilitated violations of many States’ laws—and has \nleft many women to face complications from abortion drugs with no required in-\nperson care.  \n368.  The  FDA  has  also  created  a  method  to  violate  many  States’  laws \nregarding age restrictions (like Kansas’s) and allowed rapists to hide their actions \nand avoid criminal laws because many drug shippers (A Safe Choice, Aid Access, \nMAP, and We Take Care of Us) do not have a verification mechanism, and those who \ndo (Armadillo Clinic and Abuzz) have only a minimal screening process that are \nunlikely to stop a perpetrator from obtaining chemical abortion drugs. \n369.  Of course, other organizations mail or dispense FDA-approved abortion \ndrugs to Plaintiff States, too.  \n                                            \n321 Id.  \n322 Id. \n323 Ex. 76, Plan C, Idaho, https://www.plancpills.org/abortion-pill/idaho#telehealth. \n324  Ex.  77,  Plan  C,  Kansas,  https://www.plancpills.org/abortion-\npill/kansas#telehealth.  \n325 Id.; Ex. 76, Plan C, Idaho, https://www.plancpills.org/abortion-\npill/idaho#telehealth. \n97 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 195-1   Filed 10/11/24    Page 98 of 199   PageID 9395\n370.  For example, Plan C identifies six abortion providers located in Kansas \nthat  may  provide  FDA-approved  abortion  drugs:  Planned  Parenthood  -  Wichita \nHealth Center, Aria Medical, Center for Women’s Health, Planned Parenthood - \nKansas City Health Center, Planned Parenthood - Comprehensive Health Services, \nand Trust Women Wichita.326 \nE.  The lack of in-person dispensing results in women receiving \npills  by  mail  in  one  state  from  brick-and-mortar  abortion \nproviders before returning to Plaintiff States for follow-up care.  \n371.  The FDA’s lifting of the in-person dispensing protection also enabled \nproviders with brick-and-mortar in-person locations to remotely dispense abortion \ndrug.  \n372.  Using the mail or common carrier, abortion providers at these brick-and-\nmortar locations now could add virtual options to their offerings. The FDA’s actions \nenabled them to mail abortion drugs to women up to 10 weeks pregnant from Plaintiff \nStates who traveled to the brick-and-mortar provider’s virtual service area—and then \nsend the women home to Plaintiff States without in-person follow-up care.  \n373.  No brick-and-mortar abortion provider mails to all states. Most mail \nonly to states without abortion restrictions—and they allow any person temporarily \nin those states to order abortion drugs by telehealth and mail before returning to \ntheir home states.  \n374.  For  example,  NBC  reported,  “After  the  FDA  eased  restrictions  on \nmifepristone prescriptions during pandemic, allowing women to get the abortion pill \nthrough the mail, Hey Jane [a self-described “virtual reproductive and sexual health \n                                            \n326 Ex. 78, Plan C, Kansas Abortion Clinic Guide from Plan C Pills, https://abortion-\nclinic.plancpills.org/kansas.  \n98 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 195-1   Filed 10/11/24    Page 99 of 199   PageID 9396\ncare haven”]327 took off. The company has shipped abortion pills to at least 50,000 \npatients” with mailing addresses in states without abortion restrictions.328 \n375.  The brick-and-mortar providers in Whole Woman’s Health v. FDA, No. \n3:23-cv-00019 (W.D. Va. filed May 8, 2023) and Washington v. FDA, No. 1:23-cv-03026 \n(E.D. Wash. filed Feb. 23, 2023) likewise now provide abortion drugs by mail, common \ncarrier, and interactive computer service in many states to women from Plaintiff \nStates—expanding the number of women receiving abortion drugs with no in-person \ncare who seek emergency rooms in Plaintiff States. (This virtual option is in addition \nto their in-person option for women who receive abortion drugs in person at their \nbrick-and-mortar locations.) \n376.  For example, WWH of Alexandria operates via telehealth, and Whole \nWoman’s Health of the Twin Cities, LLC, has operated a virtual program since \nAugust of 2021 that provides abortion drugs by telehealth in Virginia, Maryland, \nMinnesota,  New  Mexico,  and  Illinois.329  This  virtual  brick-and-mortar  program \nprovides medication abortion to approximately 2,400 patients per year, and the \nmajority of those patients seek telehealth in Virginia. It estimates that “[a]round half \nof our virtual patients live in the states where we provide telehealth, while the other \nhalf travel to those states from other places.”330 “Many patients require funding to \n                                            \n327 Ex. 79, Hey Jane, About Us, https://www.heyjane.com/about-us. \n328 Ex. 63, Abigail Brooks and Dasha Burns, How a Network of Abortion Pill Providers \nWorks  Together  in  the  Wake  of  New  Threats,  NBC  News  (April  7,  2024), \nhttps://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/network-abortion-pill-providers-\nworks-together-wake-new-threats-rcna146678. \n329 Ex. 51, Miller Decl. ¶ 20. \n330 Id.¶ 22. \n99 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 195-1   Filed 10/11/24    Page 100 of 199   PageID 9397\npay for their telehealth abortion, both for the visit and any associated travel to the \nstates where telehealth is available.”331  \n377.  Whole Woman’s Health is clear that FDA deregulation is essential to \nthis mail-order brick-and-mortar business model: “The optimal use of telehealth in \nthe  provision  of  abortion  care,  however,  depends  on  the  ability  to  dispense \nmifepristone remotely. Because the REMS still prohibit clinicians from writing a \nprescription for mifepristone, the only remote option for distribution of mifepristone \nis by mail.”332 “If clinicians are required to dispense mifepristone in person, their \npatients are forced to travel to the clinic to pick up the medication, even if doing so \nrequires significant travel and other logistical challenges.”333 So, when the FDA \nremoved in-person dispensing protection, “[f]or WWH and our patients, this change \nin the REMS was huge. It allowed us to build out our telehealth practice and begin \nworking with a mail order pharmacy to dispense mifepristone.”334  \n378.  The lack of an in-person dispensing protection allowed Whole Woman’s \nHealth to dispense drugs to women from States that prohibit abortion. As Whole \nWoman’s Health explains, after the REMS change, “WWH’s Virtual Program has \nbeen critical in allowing WWH to meet the demand for abortions from patients \ntraveling from states where abortion is now banned.”335 \n379.  The 2023 REMS change allows Whole Woman’s Health to dispense \nabortion drugs from New Mexico to Texas women. “[E]xpanding our virtual program \nto New Mexico allowed us to continue seeing patients traveling from Texas, even after \n                                            \n331 Id.  \n332 Id.¶ 38. \n333 Id. ¶ 39. \n334 Id. ¶¶ 40–41. \n335 Id. ¶ 42. \n100 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 195-1   Filed 10/11/24    Page 101 of 199   PageID 9398\nour Texas clinics were forced to close.”336 “Even though we now have a clinic site in \nNew Mexico, almost all of our patients seeking telehealth in New Mexico travel from \nout of state.”337 “The virtual program allows patients to reduce their travel time and \nexpense and helps ease clinic congestion.”338 “This is particularly important because \nthe New Mexico clinics, who have been inundated with patients traveling from out of \nstate  since  Roe  v.  Wade  was  overturned,  often  have  a  3-week  wait  for \nappointments.”339 The 2023 REMS change thus “is critical to the care of our patients, \nthe sustainability of our medical clinics, and the retention of our clinicians and \nstaff.”340 “Telehealth has been instrumental in allowing clinics to meet the demand \nfor abortions.”341  \n380.  Blue Mountain Clinic similarly credits the FDA’s actions with its ability \nto dispense drugs from its brick-and-mortar location remotely and by mail so long as \na person comes within Montana’s borders. It explains: “Accessing medication abortion \nvia direct-to-patient telehealth can be the difference between accessing abortion care \nor not. Reinstating a ban on dispensing mifepristone by mail would take mifepristone \noff the table as an option for these patients, who otherwise may be unable to make \nthe in-person visit for a procedural abortion.”342 \n                                            \n336 Id. ¶ 43. \n337 Id. \n338 Id. \n339 Id. \n340 Id. ¶ 47. \n341 Id. ¶ 32. \n342 Ex. 49, Smith Decl. ¶ 30. \n101 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 195-1   Filed 10/11/24    Page 102 of 199   PageID 9399\n381.  All Families also dispenses abortion drugs remotely and by mail from \nits brick-and-mortar location to patients physically present in Montana.343 More than \nhalf of its abortions are by abortion drugs and more than half of its abortion drugs \nare dispensed by mail.344  \n382.  Just  like  the  other  providers,  All  Families  points  to  the  FDA  as \nresponsible for this virtual “expansion,” which it said “opened up when a court order \nblocked the FDA from enforcing the in-person dispensing requirement in 2020” and \nwhen the “FDA then temporarily suspended the requirement in 2021 and solidified \nthat by updating the REMS in 2023 to eliminate this requirement.”345  \n383.  In  much  the  same  way,  PPGWNI  dispenses  abortion  drugs  via \ntelehealth and by mail to patients in Washington, allowing it to expand its operations \nfor  Idaho  residents  and  other  non-Washington  residents.346  PPGWNI  was  thus \n“grateful for the removal of the in-person requirement with the FDA’s recent updates \nto REMS for mifepristone.”347  \n384.  The above abortion providers from Whole Woman’s Health v. FDA348 and \nWashington v. FDA349 continue to provide abortion drugs by telehealth, mail, common \ncarrier, or other remote means to this day from their brick-and-mortar locations—\nfurther increasing the harms caused by abortion drugs.  \n                                            \n343 Ex. 50, Weems Decl. ¶ 6. \n344Id. ¶ 31. \n345 Id. \n346 Ex. 53, Dillon Decl. ¶ 20. \n347 Id. ¶ 23. \n348 No. 3:23-cv-00019-NKM, ¶1 (W.D.

Trust Women Wichita furthermore now intends to provide abortion \ndrugs through the Internet and by mail or common carrier.350 Until 2018, Trust \nWomen Wichita offered a telemedicine clinic for medication abortion,” but it was \n“forced to stop that practice due to a Kansas state law.”351 But “[t]hat law was very \nrecently enjoined.”352 So it is “particularly interested in pursuing the option to mail \nmifepristone, which would greatly expand our ability to help patients.”353 “We would \nstart as soon as we can if mifepristone remains available and possible to dispense by \ndirect to patient telehealth.”354  \n386.  In sum, in the words of all the brick-and-mortar abortion providers in \nWhole  Woman’s  Health  Alliance  v.  FDA,  “Medication  abortion,  and  specifically, \nprovision  of  mifepristone  by  advanced  practice  clinicians  (including  nurse \npractitioners and physician assistants) and the availability of medication abortion by \nmail (‘direct to patient telehealth’) has been critical” to their ability to dispense \nabortion drugs without follow-up care. Complaint, ECF No. 1, Whole Woman’s Health \nAll. v. FDA, No. 3:23-cv-00019-NKM, ¶ 2 (May 8, 2023) (hereinafter Whole Woman’s \nHealth Compl.). \nF.  The  FDA  predictably  enabled  this  50-state  abortion  drug \neconomy.  \n387.  These “third parties [have] react[ed] in predictable ways” to the FDA’s \ndecisions, and therefore their actions are causally tied to the FDA’s decisions. Dep’t \nof Com. v. New York, 139 S. Ct. 2551, 2566 (2019).  \n                                            \n350 Ex. 48, Tong Decl. ¶ 9. \n351 Id. \n352 Id. \n353 Id. \n354 Id. \n103 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 195-1   Filed 10/11/24    Page 104 of 199   PageID 9401\n388.  The FDA enabled the remote dispensing of abortion drugs into all 50 \nStates. When the FDA unlawfully removed its prohibition against mailing abortion \ndrugs, it was predictable that private parties would start mailing those drugs.  \n389.  A decision from this Court would redress this effect. As several abortion \nproviders  explained  in  Whole  Woman’s  Health  v.  FDA,  “reinstating  the  REMS \nrequirement  that  mifepristone  be  dispensed  only  in  a  clinic,  medical  office,  or \nhospital—and not via mail-order pharmacy—will eliminate abortion access for the \nlarge number of patients who have come to rely on direct to patient telehealth \nservices.”  Whole  Woman’s  Health  Compl.  ¶103.  Likewise,  as  GenBioPro  itself \nexplained in this case, “under the pre-2016 conditions … telemedicine providers and \nmail-order pharmacies constituting a substantial proportion of GenBioPro’s customer \nbase will no longer be able to prescribe or dispense GenBioPro’s product.”355 \n390.  At issue in this case are organizations mailing FDA-approved abortion \ndrugs; they differ from so-called black-market organizations that mail non-FDA-\napproved drugs.  \n391.  Plan C for instance identifies 14 websites that sell pills to Missouri, \nIdaho, and Kansas residents without a clinician as well as community networks that \nmail pills to Missouri, Idaho, and Kansas residents: Pill Pulse, Life Easy on Pills, \nHome AbortionRx, Private Emma, Medside 24, Home Abortion PillsRx, YBYCMeds, \nPrivacy Pill RX, Safe Pharmacy, Abortion Pills Rx, Generic Abortion Pills, Abortion \nRx, Online Abortion Pill Rx, and Abortion Privacy.356 Others exist, too. These smaller-\nscale black-market groups each provide abortion pills that Plan C does not describe \n                                            \n355 Amic. Br. GenBioPro, Inc., FDA v.

Just as Aid Access used to mail abortion drugs that were not FDA-\napproved,  these  providers  still  mail  drugs  from  other  countries  like  India  or \nKazakhstan from manufacturers based in China, Russia, Vietnam, Africa, or other \nunknown locations.358  \n393.  The mailing of drugs that are not FDA-approved is not at issue in this \ncase as these drugs are not attributable to the challenged FDA actions. \nXIX.  Plaintiff  States’  residents  are  receiving  abortion  drugs  in  the \nabsence of FDA’s past safeguards.  \n394.  Defendants’  actions  have  resulted  in  abortion  drugs  being  given  to \nwomen in Plaintiffs’ States by abortion providers—just as the abortion providers \nreport and as the FDA intended.  \nA.  Harm to women in Plaintiff States from the FDA’s deregulation \nof abortion drugs \n395.  Many  women  in  Plaintiff  States  have  been  harmed  by  the  FDA’s \nderegulation of abortion drugs.  \n1.  Harms caused by the FDA’s deregulation of abortion drugs \n396.  Dr. Ingrid Skop has “often treat[ed] patients who are admitted through \nthe hospital’s emergency department with complications from chemical abortions.”359 \n                                            \n357 Id.  \n358 Ex. 81, Dominique Mosbergen and Vibhuti Agarwal, Websites Selling Unapproved \nAbortion  Pills  Are  Booming,  Wall  Street  Journal  (Aug.  21,  2022), \nhttps://www.wsj.com/articles/websites-selling-unapproved-abortion-pills-are-\nbooming-11661079601.  \n359 Ex. 82, Skop Decl. ¶ 12.  \n105 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 195-1   Filed 10/11/24    Page 106 of 199   PageID 9403\n397.  Dr. Skop is a board-certified OB/GYN with privileges in the Baptist \nHospital System and a 25-year career in clinic and hospital care.360 \n398.  In her words, she has “cared for several dozen women in the emergency \ndepartment who were totally unprepared for the pain and bleeding they experienced \ndue to chemical abortion.”361  \n399.  She has “treated patients who have experienced trauma and emotional \ndistress  because  of  complications  from  chemical  abortion.”362  From  what  she \nobserved,  “[t]hose  women  were  not  anticipating  that  complications  were \npossible[.]”363 At least a dozen patients have expressed to her significant emotional \ndistress “when they viewed the body of their unborn child in the toilet after the \nchemical abortion.”364 \n400.  In her experience, “the doctors who prescribed or administered chemical \nabortion drugs to these women often did not adequately prepare them for the drugs’ \neffects, so these women could not have truly achieved informed consent.”365  \n401.  Dr. Skop has “cared for at least a dozen women who have required \nsurgery to remove retained pregnancy tissue after a chemical abortion. Sometimes \nthis includes the embryo or fetus, and sometimes it is placental tissue that has not \nbeen completely expelled.”366  \n                                            \n360 Id. ¶¶ 2, 6. \n361 Id. ¶ 13.  \n362 Id. ¶ 16.  \n363 Id. \n364 Id. ¶ 15.  \n365 Id. ¶ 14.  \n366 Id. ¶ 17.  \n106 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 195-1   Filed 10/11/24    Page 107 of 199   PageID 9404\n402.  Dr. Skop has “cared for approximately five women who, after a chemical \nabortion, have required admission for a blood transfusion or intravenous antibiotics \nor both.”367 \n403.  She reports that the “FDA's actions in 2016 and 2021 have increased the \nfrequency of complications from chemical abortion. Given my experience, I expect to \nsee and treat more patients presenting with complications from chemical abortion.”368  \n404.  “For example, in one month while covering the emergency room, my \ngroup practice admitted three women to the hospital. Of the three women admitted \nin one month due to chemical abortion complications, one required admission to the \nintensive  care  unit  for  sepsis  and  intravenous  antibiotics,  one  required  a  blood \ntransfusion for hemorrhage, and one required surgical completion for the retained \nproducts of conception (i.e., the doctors had to surgically finish the abortion with a \nsuction aspiration procedure).”369 \n405.  In another example, in her office, Dr. Skop “treated one young woman \nwho had been bleeding for six weeks after she took the chemical abortions drugs given \nto her by a doctor at a Planned Parenthood clinic. After two follow-ups at Planned \nParenthood,  during  which  she  was  given  additional  misoprostol  but  not  offered \nsurgical completion, she presented to me for help. I performed a sonogram, identified \na significant amount of pregnancy tissue remaining in her uterus, and performed a \nsuction aspiration procedure to resolve her complication.” 370 \n                                            \n367 Id. ¶ 18.  \n368 Id. ¶¶ 20–21.  \n369 Id. ¶ 22.  \n370 Id. ¶ 23.  \n107 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 195-1   Filed 10/11/24    Page 108 of 199   PageID 9405\n406.  Dr. Skop has also cared for minor women below the age of 18 who have \nobtained abortion drugs.371  \n407.  In Dr. Skop’s experience, “[t]he FDA’s actions harm women, including \n[her] patients, because without proper oversight, chemical abortions can become even \nmore dangerous than when they are supervised.”372  \n408.  The many “clinics and physicians prescribing or dispensing chemical \nabortion drugs, or websites that provide these drugs through mail order delivery \nwithout any physician involvement, often underprepare women for the severity and \nrisks of chemical abortion, and they often provide insufficient or no follow-up care to \nthose women.”373 \n409.  “Many women are inadequately prepared for the effects of the drugs, the \nseverity of the pain and bleeding they will experience, the human tissue they will \nexpel, and some are unaware that they have complicating factors such as ectopic \nimplantation, more advanced gestation than estimated, and Rh-negative blood type. \nThese patients are being abandoned because in many cases there is no doctor-patient \nrelationship, so they often present to overwhelmed emergency rooms in their distress, \nwhere they are usually cared for by physicians other than the abortion prescriber.”374 \n410.  In particular, Dr. Skop notes that “approximately 2% of pregnancies are \nectopic pregnancies, implanted outside of the uterine cavity. Chemical abortion drugs \nwill not effectually end an ectopic pregnancy because they exert their effects on the \n                                            \n371 Id. ¶ 24.  \n372 Id. ¶ 26.  \n373 Id. ¶ 27.  \n374 Id. \n108 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 195-1   Filed 10/11/24    Page 109 of 199   PageID 9406\nuterus, which leaves women at risk of severe harm from hemorrhage due to tubal \nrupture, in need of emergent surgery or potentially at risk of death.”375 \n2.  Care provided by Dr. Shaun Jester demonstrates harms \ncaused by the FDA’s deregulation of abortion drugs \n411.  Dr. Shaun Jester has likewise witnessed harm caused by the lack of \nfollow-up care for women given abortion drugs.376  \n412.  Dr. Jester is a board-certified obstetrician and gynecologist and the \nMedical Director of Moore County Ob/Gyn.377 \n413.  He  has  seen  firsthand  the  harm  the  FDA  caused  by  removing  the \nprotection that an in-person follow-up visit provides.  \n414.  The FDA hurt one of his patients by allowing for abortion drugs to be \ndispensed to her in another state without mandatory follow-up care. As he related, “I \ntreated a woman who traveled from Texas to obtain chemical abortion drugs from \nPlanned Parenthood New Mexico to complete an abortion at 10 weeks' gestation. The \nwoman returned to Texas, suffered from two weeks of moderate to heavy bleeding, \nand  then  developed  a  uterine  infection.  At  the  hospital,  I  provided  her  with \nintravenous antibiotics and performed a dilation and curettage procedure. If she had \nwaited a few more days before receiving care, she could have been septic and died. I \nreported this adverse event to the FDA.”378 \n415.  The FDA’s actions caused this patient to seek care from Dr. Jester in \nher home state of Texas, as there was no requirement for in-person follow-up care \nfrom the abortion provider in New Mexico. As he explains, “In the chemical abortion \n                                            \n375 Id. ¶ 29.  \n376 Ex. 83, Jester Decl. ¶¶ 2, 17. \n377 Id. ¶ 2. \n378 Id. ¶ 17. \n109 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 195-1   Filed 10/11/24    Page 110 of 199   PageID 9407\ncase that I reported as an adverse event to the FDA, I had no existing patient \nrelationship or prior knowledge of the patient's medical history.”379 And “it disturbed \nme that she was not informed that it was not normal to bleed for multiple weeks and \nthat if she had a routine follow-up visit, as required by past REMS, this situation \ncould have been avoided before requiring overnight hospitalization and her being at \nrisk for developing sepsis.”380 \n416.  In his experience, “the requirement for an in-person, postabortion office \nvisit, which is when a physician determines whether any fetal parts or other products \nof conception remain [is] essential to ensure that women experience no complications \nafter chemical abortion.”381 “The elimination of mandatory follow-up visits after \nchemical abortion drugs have been administered is … dangerous … Without follow-\nup  visits,  physicians  cannot  identify  potential  complications  like  sepsis  and \nhemorrhage, lingering products of conception, and others until the patient is at a \ncritical time or it is too late to help the patient.”382 \nB.  State governmental data on women in Plaintiff States receiving \nabortion drugs due to the FDA’s deregulation  \n417.  Data show how many of Plaintiff States’ residents have been receiving \nabortion drugs in the absence of the FDA’s safeguards.  \n418.  At oral argument before the Fifth Circuit, Defendants were asked about \nthe Supreme Court’s ruling that state plaintiffs in Department of Commerce v. New \nYork, 139 S. Ct. 2551 (2019), had standing. The Federal Government responded that, \nin Department of Commerce, “the plaintiffs were states,” meaning “the effects [of \n                                            \n379 Id. ¶ 20. \n380 Id. ¶ 27. \n381 Id. ¶ 10. \n382 Id. ¶ 25. \n110 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 195-1   Filed 10/11/24    Page 111 of 199   PageID 9408\nchallenged federal action] on them happened at the population level,” and the States \ncould thus “rely on population-wide statistics and probabilities.” Oral Arg.

Just as in Department of Commerce, population-wide information shows \nthe number of women affected by Defendants’ actions.  \n420.  Under state abortion reporting laws, Plaintiff States’ agencies collect \ndata  on  abortions  performed  on  state  residents.  These  estimates  are  likely  an \nundercount due to reporting inadequacies and missing data, especially in light of the \nhigh rates of chemical abortions nationwide and the known refusal of out-of-state \nproviders to submit information to Plaintiff States or comply with Plaintiffs’ abortion \nlaws. In addition, non-governmental organizations have begun collecting abortion \ndrug data for the years after Dobbs.  \n1.  Missouri’s state abortion data  \n421.  The Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services collects data on \nabortions performed on Missouri residents in Missouri and Illinois and it estimates \nthe total abortions per year on Missouri residents.384  \n422.

The large number of abortions on Missouri residents by abortion drugs \nin this table includes abortions for Missouri residents who obtained the drugs by from \nout-of-state providers, such as providers in Kansas or Illinois, who were enabled by \nthe FDA’s removal of the requirement for three in-person doctor visits. Before 2022, \nMissouri was one of the only states to successfully defend laws requiring abortion \nproviders to undertake safety measures that abortionists arrange for a physician to \nalways be available to treat complications caused by abortion drugs, and (2) that \nabortionists obtain admitting privileges at a nearby hospital.

Hawley, No. 2:16-cv-\n04313 (W.D. Mo. 2016) \n425.  By  sometime  in  2019,  Missouri’s  only  abortion  clinic  (Planned \nParenthood in St. Louis) performed no in-state abortions with chemical abortion \ndrugs, and by the end of 2020, the number of surgical abortions that it performed \n112 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 195-1   Filed 10/11/24    Page 113 of 199   PageID 9410\nmonthly was either in the single digits or zero.386 As the press reported at the time, \n“Dr.  Colleen  McNicholas,  a  Planned  Parenthood  chief  medical  officer,  said  the \nnumber of abortions performed at the St. Louis clinic has dropped since a clinic \nopened 18 miles (28 kilometers) away in Fairview Heights, Illinois, in October 2019. \nPatients at that clinic can avoid Missouri’s 72-hour mandatory waiting period, which \nrequires two appointments three days apart to receive an abortion.”387 In addition, \n“More patients are also seeking medication abortions, which the St. Louis facility has \nnot provided in more than two years because of Missouri’s requirement that patients \nwanting that procedure must undergo a pelvic exam.”388  \n426.  Consequently, although the baseline for Missouri residents’ abortions \nvia  abortion  drugs  should  be  zero  from  2019  onwards,  these  figures  show  that \nMissouri residents received at least some abortions from out-of-state providers who \ndispensed abortion drugs in a single visit and then sent women home to Missouri \nwith no in-person follow-up care—all enabled by the FDA’s lack of a requirement for \nthree in-person doctor visits, including a follow-up visit.  \n                                            \n386 Ex. 84, Associated Press, Planned Parenthood in Missouri Disputes Report State \nNo  Longer  Performs  Abortions,  But  Number  of  Procedures  Fell  Due  to  New \nRegulations,  Chicago  Tribune  (Jan.  20,  2021), \nhttps://www.chicagotribune.com/2021/01/20/planned-parenthood-in-missouri-\ndisputes-report-state-no-longer-performs-abortions-but-number-of-procedures-fell-\ndue-to-new-regulations/  (“No  surgical  abortions  were  performed  at  the  clinic  in \nDecember, with only seven in November, Planned Parenthood said, compared with \nnine and five during those months in 2019”).  \n387 Id.  \n388 Id.  \n113 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 195-1   Filed 10/11/24    Page 114 of 199   PageID 9411\n2.

The following chart summarizes this data.  \nTotal  Reported  Kansas  Abortions  and  Chemical  Abortions  by  Year, \nResidence, and Gestational Age \nYear  2015  2016  2017   2018  2019  2020  2021  2022 \nTotal Kansas  6,974  6,820  6,826  7,048  6,916  7,546  7,849  12,319 \nabortions \n--Kansans in-state   3,536  3,409  3,371  3,474  3,521  3,625  3,933  3,842 \n--Kansans out-of- 43  30  79  76  22  20  4  2 \nstate  \n--non-residents in  3,395  3,381  3,376  3,498  3,373  3,901  3,912  8,475 \nKansas \nTotal Kansas  3,092  3,623   3,962  4,321  4,446  5,056  5,321  7,340 \nchemical abortions \n  -under 9 weeks  2,673  3,154  3,521  3,828  3,922  4,310  4,439  5,533 \n  -9-12 weeks  419    468  440  487  521  740  877  1,801 \n432.  This data shows that since each of Defendants’ actions the total number \nof chemical abortions, the total number of abortions in Kansas on non-Kansans, and \nthe number of 9-12 week chemical abortions have all increased—and markedly so in \n2022 the year when Dobbs was announced.   \n433.  In this chart, the totals for out-of-state residents receiving abortion \ndrugs in Kansas includes women from Missouri who received abortion drugs in \nKansas and who then were sent home to Missouri without in-person follow visits—\nleading them to seek follow-up care as needed in Missouri.  \n434.  This governmental data reflects the known sales data of mifepristone. \nBetween 2019 and October 2023, “GenBioPro has marketed and sold approximately \n850,000 units of generic mifepristone throughout the United States.” Am. Compl., \nECF No. 75, GenBioPro, Inc. v. Raynes, No. CV 3:23-0058, at ¶¶ 1 – 2 (S.D .W.Va. \nOct. 19, 2023). \n435.  That being said, these reports and the medical literature underestimate \nabortion  rates  and  abortion  complication  rates:  abortion  providers  systemically \nviolate their duty to report abortions or complications to state governments.  \n117 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 195-1   Filed 10/11/24    Page 118 of 199   PageID 9415\n436.  For at least 15 years, abortion providers in Missouri violated a law \nrequiring them to report complications to the state.  \n437.  In sworn testimony, David Eisenberg, then an abortionist in Missouri, \nadmitted that he and other abortionists at his St. Louis clinic refused to file these \nreports even though they knew about the state law requiring the reports.393  \n438.  Colleen  McNicholas,  another  person  who  until  recently  performed \nabortions in Missouri, likewise admitted under oath that she violated this law for \nyears.394  \n439.  There is no reason to think that this systemic failure to file lawfully \nrequired complication reports is limited to Missouri. Those who performed abortions \nin Missouri also perform them elsewhere.  \n440.  Indeed,  Eisenberg  admitted  he  did  not  file  these  reports  at  “other \nhealthcare facilities” where he worked.395 And a news story describes McNicholas as \nan abortionist who “zig-zags across the Midwest,” performing abortions in many \ndifferent states.396  \n441.  Since  Dobbs,  the  lack  of  compliance  with  state  abortion  reporting \nrequirements has increased, and the resulting undercounts in state abortion data \nhave increased, as out-of-state suppliers have stepped into the market with the \npurpose of undermining state abortion laws.  \n                                            \n393 Ex. 85, ECF 48-3, Eisenberg Dep., Doc. 141-4, No. 2:16-cv-04313 (W.D.

Non-governmental data on women in Plaintiff States receiving \nabortion drugs due to the FDA’s deregulation \n442.  The abortion market shifted in 2022, 2023, and 2024 to out-of-state \nsuppliers who do not file these reports—undermining state abortion-drug reporting \nlaws and the completeness of government data.  \n443.  Non-government  parties  provide  the  best  current  estimates  of  the \nnumber of abortion drugs dispensed since 2022 or 2023.  \n444.  This nongovernmental data reflects the effect of Defendants’ actions \nfrom 2021 onwards, when Defendants first enabled abortion drugs to be dispensed \nwithout any in-person dispensing protection.  \n445.  The lack of an in-person dispensing protection in 2021 enabled many \nexisting abortion providers to provide abortion drugs by remote means within their \ncurrent states or regions as an adjunct to their current business operations. \n446.   Most States had various in-state abortion providers. With Roe in effect, \nabortion providers did not identify the same need to ship abortion drugs remotely into \nstates with abortion restrictions as when Roe was overturned.  \n447.  At the time of Dobbs, and continuing today, abortion providers in states \nwith no abortion restrictions have continued to dispense FDA-approved abortion \ndrugs outside of Plaintiff States in-person (as with the 2016 changes) and by mail, \ncommon carrier, or interactive computer service.   \n448.  But, in addition, after Dobbs, when in-state abortion providers exited \nstates  with  abortion  restrictions,  the  lack  of  an  in-person  dispensing  protection \ncaused other abortion providers to provide FDA-approved abortion drugs to women \nin Plaintiff States. They did so by telehealth (websites, video chat, email, phone, or \ntext) and through the mail or by a common carrier.  \n449.  Unlike prior abortion providers who used telehealth, mail, or common \ncarrier in response to Defendants’ 2021 actions as an adjunct to current in-person \n119 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 195-1   Filed 10/11/24    Page 120 of 199   PageID 9417\nbusiness  operations,  beginning  in  2023  these  new  abortion  providers’  business \noperations were exclusively by mail or common carrier.  \n450.  These mail-only abortion providers began to avail themselves of the \nFDA’s 2021 and 2023 changes only in mid-2023. Part of the reason for this delay of \none year from Dobbs was to create the infrastructure necessary and another part of \nthe reason for this delay was to lobby states to enact shield laws.  \n451.  By these abortion providers’ own telling, by mid-2023 they had begun \ntheir remote abortion drug shipments in earnest. The number of FDA-approved \nabortion drugs shipped across state lines has increased ever since.  \n452.  The Society of Family Planning's WeCount project aims to measure \nmonthly abortion utilization, nationally and by state, following Dobbs, based on data \nfrom many abortion providers—including data from shield law providers.397  \n453.  Telehealth is driving an increase in the national abortion totals, as the \ntotal abortions nationally was higher in 2024 than it was in 2023 or 2022.398 For \npurposes of this data, a telehealth abortion is when FDA-approved abortion drugs are \n“offered by a clinician through a remote consultation with the patient (via video, \nphone, or messaging)” that results in the drugs being “dispensed via mail.”399  \n454.  Both  in-person  and  telehealth  abortions  are  increasing  in  Kansas. \nTheWeCount reports, “Comparing the first quarter of 2024 with the first quarter of \n2023, the states with the largest increases in the average number of abortions per \n                                            \n397 Ex. 88, Society of Family Planning, #WeCount Report April 2022 to March 2024 \n(August 7, 2024), https://societyfp.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/WeCount-Report-\n7-Mar-2024-data.pdf (hereinafter #WeCount Report).  \n398 Id. at 2–3.  \n399 Id.  \n120 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 195-1   Filed 10/11/24    Page 121 of 199   PageID 9418\nmonth include New York (1,357), California (957), Virginia (597), Kansas (503), and \nPennsylvania (430).   \n455.  Among these five states, when comparing the first quarter of 2024 with \nthe first quarter of 2023, the average number of in-person abortions per month \nincreased by 29% in Kansas, 18% in New York, 13% in Virginia, and 4% in California, \nand decreased by 7% in Pennsylvania. The average number of virtual-only telehealth \nabortions was up by 59% in Kansas and 53% in Virginia.”400 \n456.  At the same time, the proportion of telehealth abortions rose “from 4% \nof all abortions in April 2022 to 20% in March 2024.”401 “Telehealth represented 21% \nof all abortions in January 2024, 19% in February, and 20% in March.”402 \n457.  This increase reflected not only the proliferation of shield-law providers, \nbut  an  increase  in  brick-and-mortar  abortion  clinics  providing  telehealth  (like \nWWH).403 “In January-March 2024, there was a national average of nearly 1,900 \nbrick-and-mortar telehealth abortions per month,” “a 33% increase from the October-\nDecember 2023 average of over 1,400.” 404 “In January-March 2024, there was an \naverage of over 6,700 monthly telehealth abortions provided under shield laws to \npeople in states with total abortion bans or 6-week bans, and nearly 2,500 monthly \ntelehealth abortions provided under shield laws to people in states with restrictions \non telehealth abortion.”405 “In January-March 2024, there was an average of nearly \n                                            \n400 Id. at 5.  \n401 Id. at 6.  \n402 Id.  \n403 Id. \n404 Id. \n405 Id. \n121 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 195-1   Filed 10/11/24    Page 122 of 199   PageID 9419\n19,700 telehealth abortions (all types) per month, representing a 14% increase from \nOctober-December 2023.406 \n458.

State-by-state  data  for  telehealth  abortions  for  states  like  Kansas \n(where abortion is not restricted) is broken down by virtual and brick-and-mortar \nproviders.413  \n465.  But WeCount aggregates data for telehealth abortions for states like \nMissouri and Idaho (where abortion is restricted or regulated), so no state-by-state \ndata is available for these states.  \n466.  The WeCount report does not include black-market, non-FDA-approved \nabortion drugs—a category of abortion drugs that are not at issue in this case.  \n467.  WeCount concurs with the widespread reporting that remote dispensing \nof FDA-approved abortion drugs “under shield laws started in June 2023, which \ntriggered their inclusion in #WeCount in July 2023.”414  \n468.  Some abortion providers were mailing black-market abortion drugs “to \nresidents of states with abortion bans, states with 6-week bans, and states with \n                                            \n412 Ex. 88, #WeCount Report, supra note 397, at 26.  \n413 Ex. 89, Society of Family Planning, #WeCount, Tables \nhttps://societyfp.org/research/wecount/ (click download the latest data for excel \nchart). \n414 Ex. 88, #WeCount Report, supra note 397, at 11.  \n124 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 195-1   Filed 10/11/24    Page 125 of 199   PageID 9422\nrestrictions on telehealth prior to June 2023, but these occurred outside the formal \nhealthcare system and were not measured by #WeCount.”415 \n469.  WeCount explained that the “[i]ncreased numbers of abortions in states \nthat permit abortion likely represent a combination of two main factors: people \ntraveling from states where they cannot access care, and increased abortions among \nresidents of states where abortion remains legal.”416 “Such volume increases are \nlikely influenced by reductions of barriers to abortion care, including reduced burden \nof cost and travel by use of telehealth, increased financial support for low-income \nabortion seekers, and improved access via care navigation from practical support \ngroups and public health departments.”417 \n470.  The Guttmacher Institute also estimates the current number of FDA-\napproved abortion drugs dispensed by abortion providers in states that do not restrict \nabortion (excluding shield-law providers who send abortion drugs to states where \nabortion is restricted).  \n471.  It  estimates  that  there  were  “approximately  642,700  medication \nabortions in the United States in 2023, accounting for 63% of all abortions in the \nformal health care system.”418 “This is an increase from 2020, when medication \nabortions accounted for 53% of all abortions.”419 \n                                            \n415 Id. at 11.  \n416 Id. at 11.  \n417 Id. at 11.  \n418 Ex. 90, Rachel K.

This rate is shown in the following chart.420 \n \n473.  If the Guttmacher Institute included data from shield law providers, \nthis rate would be even higher.  \n474.  The Guttmacher Institute collects data showing where women travel to \nreceive abortions, including women from Plaintiff States. Although this data may be \nan undercount due to reporting inadequacies, this data shows that women from \nMissouri traveled to Kansas and Illinois; women from Idaho traveled to Oregon, \nUtah,  and  Washington;  and  women  from  Kansas  largely  obtained  abortions  in \n                                            \n420 Id. \n126 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 195-1   Filed 10/11/24    Page 127 of 199   PageID 9424\nColorado and Kansas.421 It estimates that the percentage of abortions provided in \nKansas to out-of-state residents has increased from 52% in 2020 to 67% in 2023.422  \n475.  The Guttmacher Institute also estimates that the number of abortion \nproviders offering abortion drugs by video, phone call, text or online platform—and \nmail “increased from 7% of all providers” in 2020 “to 31% in 2022.”423 “Online-only \nclinics, after first appearing as a new type of abortion provider in 2021, accounted for \n8% of all abortions provided within the formal health care system in the first six \nmonths of 2023.”424  \nXX.  State laws prohibit and regulate abortion drugs.  \n476.  Plaintiff States have the sovereign power to enact and enforce abortion \nlaws.  \n477.  State abortion laws serve the important state interests in “respect for \nand preservation of prenatal life at all stages of development, the protection of \nmaternal health and safety; the elimination of particularly gruesome or barbaric \nmedical procedures; the preservation of the integrity of the medical profession; the \nmitigation of fetal pain; and the prevention of discrimination on the basis of race, sex, \nor disability.” Dobbs v.

Ferber, 458 U.S. 747, 756–57 (1982) (quoting Globe Newspaper Co. v. \nSuperior Court, 457 U.S. 596, 607 (1982)). \n481.  To  serve  these  compelling  sovereign  interests,  Plaintiff  States  have \nenacted statutes regulating and, in certain instances, prohibiting, abortion drugs. \n482.  These laws ensure the proper regulation of the practice of medicine and \nthe medical profession but Defendants’ actions undermine all these laws—including \nstate abortion restrictions and state abortion-drug reporting laws.  \n483.  The laws that the FDA likely considers preempted include the following. \n1.  Missouri’s abortion laws \n484.  The  FDA’s  unlawful  actions  threaten  several  laws,  including \n(1) Missouri’s prohibition on abortions “except in cases of medical emergency,” Mo. \nRev. Stat. § 188.017.2; (2) Missouri’s prohibition on providers administering chemical \nabortion drugs without first submitting a sufficient plan to address complications \n128 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 195-1   Filed 10/11/24    Page 129 of 199   PageID 9426\nfrom chemical abortions, id. § 188.021.2; (3) Missouri’s regulations passed under \n§ 188.021.2 requiring physicians who perform abortions to prearrange for backup \nphysicians to address complications if needed, 19 C.S.R. 10-15.050; (4) Missouri’s \nrequirement that chemical abortion drugs be dispensed in-person, not through the \nmail, Mo. Rev. Stat. § 188.021.1; (5) Missouri’s requirement that no person shall \nperform an abortion except a physician, Mo. Rev. Stat. § 188.020; and (6) Missouri’s \nrequirement that no person shall perform or induce an abortion (except in a medical \nemergency) unless a physician or qualified professional has explained the general and \nspecific risks to the woman receiving the abortion, Mo. Rev. State. § 188.039.   \n485.  Missouri  law  prohibits  any  abortion  “except  in  cases  of  medical \nemergency.” Mo. Rev. Stat. § 188.017.2.  \n486.  Missouri law also states that no provider can administer a chemical \nabortion drug without first submitting a treatment plan to address complications and \nobtaining approval from the health department of that plan: \nWhen the Food and Drug Administration label of any drug or chemical \nused for the purpose of inducing an abortion includes any clinical study \nin which more than one percent of those administered the drug or \nchemical  required  surgical  intervention  after  its  administration,  no \nphysician may prescribe or administer such drug or chemical to any \npatient without first obtaining approval from the department of health \nand  senior  services  of  a  complication  plan  from  the  physician  for \nadministration of the drug or chemical to any patient.  \nMo. Rev. Stat. § 188.021.2. \n487.  Regulations  passed  under  this  law  require  physicians  who  perform \nabortions to prearrange for backup physicians to address complications if needed. 19 \nC.S.R. 10-15.050. Missouri statutes and regulations require physicians to plan for \nand provide care for abortion complications so that persons receiving abortions are \n129 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 195-1   Filed 10/11/24    Page 130 of 199   PageID 9427\nnot forced to go to emergency rooms. See Mo. Rev. Stat. § 188.021.1–.2; 19 C.S.R. 10-\n15-050.  \n488.  But the FDA’s challenged actions cause doctors who live and work in \nPlaintiff States to treat more women and girls who have suffered complications from \nchemical abortion drugs because physicians are not providing follow-up care when \nindividuals experience complications. ECF 176, ¶¶ 363–68.   \n489.  Missouri law includes an in-person dispensing protection for abortion \ndrugs. “When RU-486 (mifepristone) or any drug or chemical is used for the purpose \nof inducing an abortion, the initial dose of the drug or chemical shall be administered \nin the same room and in the physical presence of the physician who prescribed, \ndispensed, or otherwise provided the drug or chemical to the patient.” Mo. Rev. Stat. \n§ 188.021.1.  \n490.  The  in-person  dispensing  protection  ensures  that  physicians  “shall \nmake all reasonable efforts” to ensure patient follow-up, decreasing the chance that \na woman will find herself in an emergency room with a doctor who has no idea what \nhappened. Mo. Rev. Stat. § 188.021.1.  \n491.  Other states have similar protections. See Am. Coll. of Obstetricians & \nGynecologists v. FDA, 467 F. Supp. 3d 282, 286–87 (D. Md. 2020) (collecting laws from \nnine states, including Missouri).  \n492.  Missouri requires the physician to make all reasonable efforts to ensure \nthe patient returns for a follow-up visit after the administration or use of mifepristone \nor any drug or chemical for the purpose of inducing an abortion. Mo. Rev. Stat. § \n188.021.  \n493.  Missouri limits who may induce an abortion. State law restricts any \nperson other than a physician with clinical privileges at a hospital from performing, \ninducing, or attempting to perform or induce an abortion on another, restricts any \nphysician who does not have clinical privileges at a hospital which offers obstetrical \n130 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 195-1   Filed 10/11/24    Page 131 of 199   PageID 9428\nor gynecological care located within thirty miles of the location the abortion is to be \nperformed to perform, induce, or attempt to perform or induce an abortion, and \nrestricts any person, except a physician, from performing or inducing an abortion. \nMo. Rev. Stat. § 188.080. No person shall perform or induce an abortion except a \nphysician. Mo. Rev. Stat. § 188.020 \n494.  Missouri requires informed consent and a 72-hour waiting period. Mo. \nRev. Stat. § 188.027. Under this state law, a woman must give her voluntary and \ninformed consent, freely and without coercion, at least 72 hours before an abortion is \nperformed. For consent to be voluntary and informed, a physician must orally inform \nthe woman of the following in person and writing: \n•  the name of the physician performing the abortion; \n•  medically accurate and relevant materials to the decision of whether to undergo \nthe abortion; \n•  a description of the proposed abortion method; \n•  the immediate and long-term medical and psychological risks associated with the \nabortion and medication administered; \n•  the  unborn  child’s  gestational  age  and  anatomical  and  physiological \ncharacteristics of the unborn child; \n•  alternative options to abortion; \n•  the opportunity for the patient to ask questions of the provider regarding the \nprocedure; and \n•  the location of the nearest hospital and where the woman can receive follow-up \ncare by the physician if complications arise. \n131 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 195-1   Filed 10/11/24    Page 132 of 199   PageID 9429\n495.  Missouri’s 72-hour waiting period also provides that, except in the case \nof medical emergency, no person shall perform or induce an abortion unless at least \nseventy-two hours beforehand the physician who is to perform or induce the abortion, \na qualified professional, or the referring physician has conferred with the patient and \ndiscussed with her the indicators and contraindicators, and risk factors including any \nphysical, psychological, or situational factors for the proposed procedure and the use \nof medications, including but not limited to mifepristone, in light of her medical \nhistory and medical condition. For an abortion performed or an abortion induced by \na drug or drugs, such conference shall take place at least seventy-two hours prior to \nthe writing or communication of the first prescription for such drug or drugs in \nconnection with inducing an abortion. Only one such conference shall be required for \neach abortion. Mo. Ann. Stat. § 188.039.  \n496.  Missouri  requires  parental  notification  and  consent  for  a  minor’s \nabortion. Mo. Rev. Stat. § 188.028(1)(1) requires the attending physician to secure \ninformed written consent of the minor and one parent or guardian, and the consenting \nparent or guardian of the minor has notified any other custodial parent in writing \nprior  to  securing  the  informed  written  consent  of  the  minor and  one  parent  or \nguardian. \n497.  Missouri  also  has  an  ultrasound  requirement.  Mo.  Rev.  Stat. \n§ 188.027(4). Under this law, the performing physician must provide the woman with \nan opportunity to view an active and free ultrasound and hear the heartbeat of the \nunborn child at least 72 hours before the abortion.  \n498.  Missouri requires abortion facilities to maintain written protocols for \nmedical emergencies and transfer of patients, and grants the department of health to \nadopt rules, regulations, or standards that apply to ambulatory surgical centers and \nabortion facilities. Missouri requires all ambulatory and abortion facilities to obtain \n132 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 195-1   Filed 10/11/24    Page 133 of 199   PageID 9430\na license to operate. Mo. Rev. Stat. § 188.015, Mo. Rev. Stat. § 188.215, Mo. Rev. Stat. \n§ 197.225, Mo. Rev. Stat. § 197.205.  \n499.  Missouri  requires  malpractice  insurance:  it  restricts  hospitals  or \nabortion facilities from employing or engaging the services of a person that would \nperform an abortion using any drug or chemical or combination thereof, which may \ncause birth defects, disability, or other injury to a child who survives the abortion if \nthe person does not have insurance. Mo. Rev. Stat. § 188.044 \n500.  Missouri  requires  an  individual  abortion  report  for  each  abortion \nperformed or induced upon a woman to be completed by the physician who performed \nor induced the abortion. This abortion report shall be made part of the medical record \nof the patient of the abortion facility or hospital where the abortion was performed. \nMo. Rev. Stat. § 188.052.  \n2.  Idaho’s abortion laws  \n501.  Idaho abortion laws prohibit abortion except in certain circumstances, \nprohibit anyone other than a physician from performing an abortion, requires in-\nperson exams before any abortion, requires plan for local follow-up care, and requires \nabortions to occur in regulated medical facilities, among other restrictions that the \nFDA likely considers preempted by the REMS.  \n502.  Idaho  law  regulates  abortion-inducing  drugs  like  mifepristone.  See \nIdaho Code §§ 18-602 (recognizing “[t]hat children have a special place in society that \nthe  law  should  reflect”),  18-604(1)  (“Abortion”  means  the  use  of  any  means  to \nintentionally  terminate  the  clinically  diagnosable  pregnancy  of  a  woman  with \nknowledge that the termination by those means will, with reasonable likelihood, \ncause  the  death  of  the  unborn  child”),  18-617  (defining  “Abortifacient”  to  mean \n“mifepristone, misoprostol and/or other chemical or drug dispensed with the intent of \ncausing an abortion as defined in section 18-604(1)”), and 18-622 (“Every person who \n133 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 195-1   Filed 10/11/24    Page 134 of 199   PageID 9431\nperforms or attempts to perform an abortion as defined in this chapter commits the \ncrime of criminal abortion.”).  \n503.  Idaho  limits  abortion  unless  necessary  to  prevent  the  death  of  the \npregnant woman. Idaho Code § 18-622.  \n504.  Idaho authorizes only a physician to perform an abortion. Idaho Code § \n18-608A. It is unlawful for any person other than a physician to cause or perform an \nabortion.  \n505.  As to abortion drugs, Idaho requires a physician, before dispensing or \nprescribing  abortion-inducing  drugs,  to:  assess  the  duration  of  the  pregnancy, \ndetermine that the unborn child is within the uterus, be qualified to provide surgical \nintervention or have an agreement with other local physicians to provide surgical \nintervention, provide informed consent, and make reasonable efforts to ensure that \nthe patient returns for a follow-up visit. Idaho Code § 18-617.  \n506.  Idaho requires informed consent and imposes a 24-hour waiting period \nbefore any abortion. Under Idaho Code § 18-609(2), (4), at least 24 hours before \nperforming  the  abortion,  the  physician  must  provide  materials  to  the  woman \ndescribing: \n•  services available to assist a woman through pregnancy and childbirth; \n•  the physical characteristics of a normal fetus at two-week intervals, accompanied \nby photographs; \n•  the  abortion  procedures  at  various  stages  of  the  fetus  and  any  reasonable \nforeseeable complications and risks to the mother; \n•  a  list  of  health  care  providers,  facilities,  and  clinics  that  offer  to  perform \nultrasounds free of charge; \n134 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 195-1   Filed 10/11/24    Page 135 of 199   PageID 9432\n•  statement that the patient has a right to view an ultrasound image and observe \nthe heartbeat monitoring; \n•  where to obtain further information about interventions for chemical abortion that \nmay affect the effectiveness or reversal of a chemical abortion; \n•  resources on Down Syndrome. \n507.  Idaho  requires  printed  materials  to  be  provided  with  information \ndirecting  the  patient  where  to  obtain  assistance  regarding  chemical  abortion, \nincluding the interventions, if any, that may affect the effectiveness or reversal of a \nchemical abortion. Idaho Code § 18-609(2)(f) \n508.  Idaho law provides that 24 hours before an abortion is to be performed, \nthe  physician  must  inform  the  woman  that  ultrasound  imaging  and  heartbeat \nmonitoring are available and that she has the right to view an ultrasound before an \nabortion is performed. Idaho Code  § 18-609(5)–(6).  \n509.  Idaho requires parental consent for a minor seeking abortion. Idaho \nCode § 18-609A(1). A physician must secure written consent from an unemancipated \nminor’s parent or guardian unless the minor waives consent through a judicial bypass \nprocedure. Idaho Code § 18-609A(2).  \n510.  Idaho  requires  that  all  first  trimester  abortions  be  performed  in  a \nhospital or properly staffed and equipped office or clinic and requires second trimester \nabortions to be performed in a hospital. Idaho Code § 18-608(1).  \n511.  Idaho  requires  reports  on  abortions  to  be  filed  describing  probable \npostfertilization age, whether or not there was a medical emergency, and the method \nused for abortion. Idaho Code § 18-506.  \n3.  Kansas’s abortion laws \n512.  Kansas also regulates abortion and other medical services. \n135 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 195-1   Filed 10/11/24    Page 136 of 199   PageID 9433\n513.  With some exceptions, including to save the life of the mother, Kansas \nlaw prohibits abortions after twenty-two weeks.  Kan. Stat. Ann. § 65-6703(b)(2), \n(c)(2). \n514.  Kansas requires abortion providers to keep records of abortions.  Id. \n§ 65-6703(d). \n515.  Kansas requires minor girls seeking abortion to obtain parental consent \nprior to performing the abortion unless a waiver is granted or there is a medical \nemergency.  Kan. Stat. Ann. § 65-6705. \n516.  Kansas provides that no abortion shall be performed or induced without \nthe voluntary and informed consent of the woman upon whom the abortion is to be \nperformed or induced. Except in the case of a medical emergency, consent to an \nabortion is voluntary and informed only if at least 24 hours before the abortion the \nphysician who is to perform the abortion or the referring physician has informed the \nwoman in writing, which shall be provided on white paper in a printed format in black \nink with 12-point Times New Roman font, of certain information. Kan. Stat. Ann. \n§ 65-6709(a).  \n517.  Kansas previously had a statute where “[n]o abortion shall be performed \nor induced by any person other than a physician.” Kan. Stat. Ann. § 65-4a10 (West). \nIn  addition,  this  statute  required  mifepristone  specifically  be  “initially  be \nadministered by or in the same room and in the physical presence of the physician \nwho prescribed, dispensed, or otherwise provided the drug to the patient.” Id. It also \nhad an in-person follow-up protection. Id. All of these provisions would have a high \nrisk for preemption. However, this statute was held unconstitutional very recently by \nthe Kansas Supreme Court in Hodes & Nauser, MDs, P.A. v. Stanek, 551 P.3d 62 \n(Kan. 2024).  \n136 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 195-1   Filed 10/11/24    Page 137 of 199   PageID 9434\n4.  Other states’ abortion laws \n518.  Many other state laws likewise address the risks of chemical abortions. \nSuch  laws  recognize,  for  example,  that  “abortion-inducing  drugs”:  “present[ ] \nsignificant medical risks to women,” such as “uterine hemorrhage, viral infections, \npelvic inflammatory disease, severe bacterial infection and death,” Miss. Code Ann. \n§ 41-41-103(1)(a); “are associated with an increased risk of complications relative to \nsurgical abortion” that surge “with increasing gestational age,” id. § 41- 41-103(1)(b); \nand “are contraindicated in ectopic pregnancies,” id. § 41-41-107(2). So many states \ncombat those risks by, among other things, requiring that only physicians may \nprovide such drugs, that a physician may do so only after “physically examin[ing] the \nwoman and document[ing] ... the gestational age and intrauterine location of the \npregnancy,” and that these drugs “must be administered in the same room and in the \nphysical presence of the physician.” Id. § 41-41-107(1)-(3).  \n519.  Many other states require in-person exams or dispensing or have other \nabortion statutes that the FDA likely considers preempted. See, e.g., Ala. Code § 26-\n23E-7, 26-23A-4(a), 26-23A-4(b); Alaska Stat. Ann. §§ 08.64.364(c)(1), 08.64.364(c)(2); \nAriz. Rev. Stat.

And, like all elective abortions, elective chemical abortions are generally \nunlawful in several additional States. E.g., Ark. Code Ann. § 20-16-1304 et seq.; Miss. \nCode  Ann.  §  41-41-45(2)  (abortion  unlawful  except  “where  necessary  for  the \npreservation of the mother’s life or where the pregnancy was caused by rape”).  \n521.  When the FDA lifted the in-person dispensing protection in 2021, 19 \nstates prohibited or restricted dispensing abortion drugs remotely, as the following \nmap shows.  \n138 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 195-1   Filed 10/11/24    Page 139 of 199   PageID 9436\nStates Protecting Against Remote Dispensing of Abortion Drugs425 \n522.

Kansas provides that no abortion shall be performed or induced without \nthe voluntary and informed consent of the woman upon whom the abortion is to be \nperformed or induced. Except in the case of a medical emergency, consent to an \nabortion is voluntary and informed only if at least 24 hours before the abortion the \nphysician who is to perform the abortion or the referring physician has informed the \nwoman in writing, which shall be provided on white paper in a printed format in black \nink with 12-point Times New Roman font, of certain information.

Snapp & Son, Inc. v. \nPuerto Rico, 458 U.S. 592, 601 (1982)). \n526.  “Pursuant  to  that  interest,  states  may  have  standing  based  on \n(1) federal  assertions  of  authority  to  regulate matters  they  believe  they  control, \n(2) federal preemption of state law, and (3) federal interference with the enforcement \nof state law, at least where ‘the state statute at issue regulates behavior or provides \n141 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 195-1   Filed 10/11/24    Page 142 of 199   PageID 9439\nfor the administration of a state program’ and does not ‘simply purport to immunize \nstate citizens from federal law.’” Texas v. United States, 809 F.3d 134, 153 (5th Cir. \n2015), as revised (Nov. 25, 2015) (citation omitted) (collecting cases).  \n527.  As a result of Defendants’ actions, Plaintiffs have suffered injury to their \nsovereign interests in enacting and enforcing their laws. Defendants (1) intentionally \nfacilitated widespread violations by third parties of state abortion laws by enabling \nan out-of-state abortion drug distribution network out of the reach of the enforcement \nof State laws, (2) unlawfully removed the backstop of federal law and federal law \nenforcement, upon which the States were entitled to rely, (3) purport to preempt state \nabortion laws, and (4) seek to displace and nullify the States’ state-law parental \nrights of notice and consent for abortions for teen girls in foster care. \n528.  These harms are distinct (and in addition to) the harms suffered by the \ncitizens of Plaintiffs as a result of Defendant’s challenged actions. \n529.  The harms to Plaintiffs’ sovereign interests in enacting and enforcing \ntheir laws are irreparable. See, e.g., Kansas v. United States, 249 F.3d 1213, 1227 \n(10th Cir. 2001) (holding that Kansas suffered an irreparable harm where a federal \nagency’s  decision  “places  [Kansas’]  sovereign  interests  and  public  policies  at \nstake[.]”).  \n530.  “The threatened injury to a State’s enforcement of its safety laws is \nwithin the zone of interests of the Administrative Procedure Act[.]” State of Ohio ex \nrel. Celebrezze v. U.S. Dep’t of Transp., 766 F.2d 228, 233 (6th Cir. 1985).  \n531.  Absent  the  relief  sought  in  this  lawsuit,  Defendants’  actions  will \ncontinue to encourage the violation or preemption of Plaintiffs’ laws and will harm \nPlaintiffs’ sovereign interests in the enforcement and enactment of their laws. \n142 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 195-1   Filed 10/11/24    Page 143 of 199   PageID 9440\nA.  Injury  to  Plaintiffs’  sovereign  interests  in  the  creation  and \nenforcement of their abortion regulations through Defendants’ \nfacilitation of third parties’ state-law violations. \n532.  Plaintiff States are injured as sovereigns by Defendants’ intentional \nenablement of third parties to undermine state law enforcement and to violate state \nabortion-drug laws.  \n533.  Plaintiff States have a sovereign interest in ensuring the enforcement of \ntheir duly passed laws. See Texas v. United States, 787 F.3d 733, 752 n.38 (5th Cir. \n2015); cf. Abbott v. Perez, 585 U.S. 579, 602 n. 17 (2018) (“[T]he inability to enforce \nits duly enacted plans clearly inflicts irreparable harm on the State[.]”). \n534.  The FDA’s decision has interfered with the enforcement of state laws \nthat  prohibit  abortion  in  certain  circumstances  and  that  require  in-person \nadministration of any abortion drugs.   \n535.  Defendants  have  intentionally  undermined  state  laws  by  enabling \nwidespread state-law criminal and civil violations by third parties, which constitutes \nan injury to Plaintiff States’ sovereign interest in creating and enforcing a legal code. \n536.  Defendants’  actions  have  created  a  practical  impediment  to  on-the-\nground compliance with and enforcement of state laws.  \n537.  The FDA’s deregulatory actions have each increased Plaintiff States’ \nsovereign harms. \n538.  By lowering the barriers to obtain mifepristone, including removing the \nsafeguard  that  the  drug  be  administered  in-person  by  a  licensed  physician, \nDefendants have removed the restrictions that prevented or limited the ability of \nthird parties to unlawfully provide mifepristone in Plaintiff States.  \n539.  The 2016 Changes removed the safeguards ensuring follow-up care, \nenabling providers to supply women with these drugs without the ability to diagnose \nand treat life-threatening complications.  \n143 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 195-1   Filed 10/11/24    Page 144 of 199   PageID 9441\n540.  This  change  enabled  out-of-state  abortion-drug  suppliers  to  provide \nabortion drugs to women from Plaintiff States by allowing women to receive drugs \nout of state and then immediately return home to take the drugs.  \n541.  In 2021, the FDA began declining to enforce the in-person dispensing \nprotection of the REMS for mifepristone. \n542.  Under the FDA’s new regime, manufacturers may sell abortion drugs to \nsuppliers, who then prescribe and mail the drugs to women in Plaintiff states without \nan in-person examination—which enables the providers to evade and violate State \nlaws prohibiting or regulating the provision of abortion drugs.  \n543.  This unlawful act had the direct and intended effect of enabling and \nencouraging third parties to provide, through the mail, mifepristone to citizens of \nPlaintiff States for the purpose of inducing high-risk abortions that are expressly \ncontrary to the policies expressed in many state statutes.   \n544.  Since 2021, abortion providers have been mailing FDA-regulated doses \nof mifepristone into Plaintiff States for the purpose of providing abortions to people \nin states that have laws prohibiting chemical abortions.  \n545.  Out-of-state organizations have begun mailing abortion pills directly \ninto  Plaintiff  States  in  reliance  on  the  FDA’s  decision  to  remove  the  in-person \ndispensing protection and the required in-person follow-up visit.  \n546.  This out-of-state market then exploded when the FDA allowed abortion \ndrugs to be dispensed by mail, common carrier, and interactive computer service.  \n547.  This market continued and increased after the FDA formalized the \nremoval of the in-person dispensing protection in January 2023. \n548.  All of this makes it difficult for state law enforcement to detect and deter \nstate law violations and to give effect to state abortion laws. \n144 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 195-1   Filed 10/11/24    Page 145 of 199   PageID 9442\n549.  The FDA’s actions force States to divert resources to investigate and \naddress the harms that this lawbreaking will inflict on women, children, and the \npublic interest. \n550.  The FDA’s actions thus “intrude on state governmental functions[,]” \nGregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U.S. 452, 470 (1991), and hobble States’ efforts to protect \nhealth and safety. \n551.  The  FDA’s  actions  moreover  depart  from  the  central  tenet  of  our \nConstitution: that power—particularly over important, hard, controversial issues—\nresides with and must be accountable to the people.  \n552.  Few issues are as important, difficult, and controversial as abortion. The \nConstitution thus leaves the task of regulating and restricting abortion to “the people \nand their elected representatives.” Dobbs, 142 S. Ct. at 2284. Yet the FDA’s actions \nby design and in practice rob from the people in the Plaintiff States important \ndecisions on this vital issue.  \n553.  State abortion laws embody the considered judgments of “the people and \ntheir  elected  representatives.”  Dobbs,  142  S.  Ct.  at  2284.  Defendants’  actions \neviscerating these laws injures the States.  \nB.  Injury  to  Plaintiffs’  sovereign  interests  in  enforcing  state \nabortion regulations through Defendants’ non-enforcement or \nremoval of the backstop of federal law. \n554.  Plaintiff States are injured as sovereigns by Defendants’ unlawful non-\nenforcement  of  federal  statutes  that  result  in  restrictions  on  the  dispensing  of \nabortion drugs and by their unlawful removal of the backstop of federal law.  \n555.  The FDA’s decisions have deprived Plaintiff States of their sovereign \n“benefits that are to flow from participation in the federal system.” Alfred L. Snapp, \n458 U.S. at 608.  \n145 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 195-1   Filed 10/11/24    Page 146 of 199   PageID 9443\n556.  One such benefit is the uniform application of federal law and the ability \nof States to rely on the backdrop of federal law when enacting their own regulations. \nCrow Indian Tribe v. United States, 965 F.3d 662, 676-677 (9th Cir. 2020). \n557.  Plaintiff States have relied on the actual or potential backdrop of federal \nlaws and federal law enforcement so the States can implement their own policies \nabout in-person administration, protection of human life, and other policies.   \n558.  Before  Defendants’  changes  to  the  REMS,  the  federal  government \nensured that abortion drugs were only dispensed in person, that abortion drugs were \nnot dispensed by mail, common carrier, or interactive computer service, that abortion \ndrugs were provided through three in-person doctor visits, and that abortion drugs \nwere provided by doctors only.  \n559.  Defendants actively enforced and administered this federal regulatory \nstructure, which reflected the requirements of various federal laws. Plaintiff States \nrelied on these various federal laws and Defendants’ actual or potential enforcement \nof these laws.  \n560.  During  this  time,  no  relevant  federal  statute  changed.  Instead, \nDefendants  changed  their  regulatory  actions  and  their  resulting  enforcement—\nseeking to create a change in federal law through deregulatory action.  \n561.  But because these deregulatory actions failed to comply with federal \nstatutes like the FDCA, PREA, and APA, these regulatory actions did not result in a \nvalid change to federal law. Instead, they amounted to an unlawful removal of a prior \nfederal regulatory structure that provided a backdrop to state regulations providing \nsimilar or greater restrictions on abortion.  \n562.  In particular, Defendants’ prior federal regulatory structure in practice \nreinforced federal and state statutes against dispensing abortion drugs remotely or \nby mail, common carrier, or interactive computer service.  \n146 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 195-1   Filed 10/11/24    Page 147 of 199   PageID 9444\n563.  Each  of  Defendants’  challenged  actions  successively  removed \nDefendants’ assistance in enforcing federal and state restrictions on abortion drugs, \nsuch that abortion drugs now need not be dispensed in person, that abortion drugs \nmay be dispensed by mail, common carrier, or interactive computer service, that \nabortion drugs may be provided without any in-person doctor visits, and that abortion \ndrugs may be provided by non-doctors.  \n564.  Plaintiff States are injured by each unlawful withdrawal of Defendants’ \npast and future enforcement of these federal laws, including by their changes to the \nREMS that resulted in the REMS no longer reflecting the requirements of these \nfederal laws. \n565.  Plaintiff States’ sovereign interest in the enforcement of federal law and \nstate  law  has  now  been  impaired.  The  challenged  FDA  actions  “impaired  that \ninterest, because [federal] officials withdrew resources and manpower that further \nthe enforcement of federal and state] law.” United States v. Missouri, No. 23-1457, \n2024 WL 3932470, at *2 (8th Cir. Aug. 26, 2024).  \n566.  Defendants’ withdrawal of this federal assistance transfers the burden \nof law enforcement solely to the States and it at once makes it harder for the States \nto enforce these laws, by shifting abortion drugs into the widespread, anonymous \nstream of commerce taking place through the mail, common carriers, and interactive \ncomputer services.  \n567.  Interference with the state government’s interest in enforcing federal \nand state law is sufficient to establish that Defendants’ action injured Plaintiff \nStates. Missouri, No. 23-1457, 2024 WL 3932470, at *2.  \n568.  “An increased regulatory burden typically satisfies the injury in fact \nrequirement.” Contender Farms, L.L.P. v. U.S. Dep’t of Agric., 779 F.3d 258, 266 (5th \nCir. 2015). \n147 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 195-1   Filed 10/11/24    Page 148 of 199   PageID 9445\nC.  Injury  to  Plaintiffs’  sovereign  interests  in  enforcing  state \nabortion  regulations  through  Defendants’  purported \npreemption of state abortion regulations. \n569.  Plaintiffs have a sovereign interest in their laws not being displaced, \npreempted, or nullified by the federal government. Texas Office of Public Utility \nCounsel v. F.C.C., 183 F.3d 393, 449 (5th Cir. 1999) (quoting Alfred L. Snapp, 458 \nU.S. at 601). \n570.  Thus, “irreparable harm exists when a federal regulation prevents a \nstate from enforcing its duly enacted laws.” Texas v. Becerra, 577 F. Supp. 3d 527, \n557 (N.D. Tex. 2021) (collecting cases); see also, e.g., Maryland v. King, 567 U.S. 1301, \n1303 (2012) (Roberts, C.J.: “[A]ny time a State is enjoined by a court from effectuating \nstatutes enacted by representatives of its people, it suffers a form of irreparable \ninjury[.]”). \n571.  Through  announcements  from  HHS  and  DOJ,  Defendants  seek  “to \npreempt” each States’ laws, and this attempt at preemption of state law is itself an \ninjury. Deanda v. Becerra, 96 F.4th 750, 760 (5th Cir. 2024) (“Deanda has shown an \nArticle III injury because the Secretary seeks to preempt his state-conferred right to \nconsent to his children’s obtaining contraceptives”).  \n572.  Defendants purport to preempt state laws regulating the dispensing of \nabortion drugs, including treatment plans, state approval, physician dispensing, \nrequirements for back-up physicians, and in-person dispensing. \n573.  In addition, more than one federal court has determined that state \nabortion drug regulations are preempted by the FDA’s REMS.  \n574.  In one case, a federal court held that the FDA’s “2023 REMS reflect[ ] a \ndetermination by the FDA that when mifepristone is prescribed, it may be prescribed \nvia telemedicine.” GenBioPro, Inc. v. Sorsaia, No. CV 3:23-0058, 2023 WL 5490179, \nat *10 (S.D.W. Va. Aug. 24, 2023). On that basis, the court ruled that West Virginia’s \n148 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 195-1   Filed 10/11/24    Page 149 of 199   PageID 9446\nlaw—which, like Missouri’s, does not permit telemedicine abortion with chemical \nabortion  drugs—was  preempted.  Id.  Although  the  plaintiff  later  voluntarily \ndismissed its (successful) preemption claim, it appears the plaintiff did so because it \nneeded to drop the one count that was not dismissed so that the district court’s ruling \ndismissing all other counts would become a final judgment that could be appealed. \nSee  GenBioPro,  ECF  78  (filing a  notice of  appeal  three  days  after  dropping  its \nsuccessful preemption argument).  \n575.  In another case, a federal court enjoined the enforcement of several \nNorth Carolina state abortion drug regulations on a similar theory. Bryant v. Stein, \nNo. 1:23-CV-77, 2024 WL 3107568, at *1 (M.D.N.C. June 3, 2024). That court enjoined \nstate laws that “prohibit any healthcare provider other than a licensed physician from \nproviding mifepristone,” id. (citing N.C. Gen. Stat § 90-21.83A, § 90-21.83B, § 90-\n21.93), that “require that mifepristone be provided in person,” id. (citing N.C. Gen. \nStat. § 14-44.1, § 90-21.83A, § 90-21.83B), state laws that “require scheduling an in-\nperson follow-up visit after providing mifepristone or efforts to ensure such a follow-\nup appointment,” id. (citing N.C. Gen. Stat. § 90-21.83A, § 90-21.83B, § 90-21.93), \nand state laws that require the reporting of non-fatal adverse events related to \nmifepristone to the FDA,” id. (citing N.C. Gen. Stat. § 90-21.93).  \n576.  The court held that these abortion drug regulations “stand as obstacles” \nto  the  FDA  REMS. Bryant  v.  Stein,  No.  1:23-CV-77, 2024  WL  1886907, at  *15 \n(M.D.N.C. Apr. 30, 2024), appeal filed, Nos. 24-1576, 1600, 1617 (4th Cir. 2024). \n“When a state imposes a restriction on the sale or distribution of an FDA-approved \ndrug that is designed to reduce the risks associated with the drug even though the \nFDA explicitly considered and rejected that restriction as unnecessary for safe use \nunder the statutory regime imposed and required by Congress, then that state law is \npreempted.” Id. “North Carolina cannot second-guess the FDA's explicit judgment on \n149 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 195-1   Filed 10/11/24    Page 150 of 199   PageID 9447\nhow to manage risks from and safely prescribe, dispense, and administer REMS \ndrugs, including mifepristone.” Id. at *17.  \n577.  If  sued,  Plaintiff  States  will  vigorously  dispute  that  their  laws  are \npreempted by FDA’s REMS, but HHS and DOJ’s announcements and the GenBioPro \ndecision each make clear that the FDA’s unlawful REMS creates a substantial risk \nof injury to Plaintiff States in the form of interference with Plaintiff States’ ability to \ncreate and enforce a legal code. \nD.  Injury to Plaintiffs’ sovereign interests in exercising state-law \nparental rights of notice and consent for abortions for teen girls \nin foster care. \n578.  Plaintiff States are also injured because Defendants have sought to \ninterfere with and nullify the States’ exercise of state-law parental rights for children \nin state custody, such as teen girls in the foster care system.  \n579.  By seeking to enable teen girls to obtain abortion drugs online by mail \nall on their own, Defendants seek “to undermine [the States’] state right to consent \nto [their custodial] children’s medical care[.]” Deanda, 96 F.4th at 755. “That invasion \nof [Plaintiff States’] state-created right alone creates Article III injury.” Id. at 753.  \n580.  The FDA’s decisions to increase access to (and demand for) chemical \nabortions inflict substantial economic injury on Plaintiff States because it risks harm \nto girls in state custody, both girls in state foster care systems or other state facilities.  \n581.  Each Plaintiff State is the legal parent or guardian of many minor girls \nof reproductive age.  \n582.  Each Plaintiff State has well-established state foster care systems and \nother state facilities for minor girls. State foster care systems can include girls in \nstate facilities or placed with licensed foster care families. Each State has detailed \nlaws and procedures to protect these girls’ health and welfare while in state custody \nor control.  \n150 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 195-1   Filed 10/11/24    Page 151 of 199   PageID 9448\n583.  Plaintiff States are the legal parent, guardian, or custodian of many \nminor girls in state foster care systems or other state facilities. \n584.   Plaintiff States actively enforce and administer their rights to decide \nwhether these children obtain medical care.  \n585.  Plaintiff States may assert parental rights that would otherwise belong \nto the parents of minor girls in the foster care system or other state facilities, so long \nas the minor’s prior parents’ rights have been terminated and the State has become \nthe minor’s legal parent. This standing is similar to the rights of parents to seek relief \non behalf of their children as next friend.  \n586.  Minor  girls  in  the  foster  care  system  or  other  state  facilities  are \nsusceptible to pregnancy and to seeking abortions.  \n587.  These girls are protected by state laws providing for State control of \ntheir medical care and by state laws restricting or prohibiting abortion.  \n588.  Before the FDA’s deregulatory actions, the States (as legal parent or \nguardian) were entitled to know or consent to abortions for minor girls in the foster \ncare system or other state facilities.  \n589.  The  FDA’s  deregulatory  actions  impede  and  undermine  the  States’ \nstate-law rights to prior notice and consent to abortions for minor girls in state foster \ncare systems and girls in state facilities.  \n590.  The  FDA’s  deregulatory  actions  impede  and  undermine  the  States’ \nstate-law rights to restrict and prohibit abortions for minor girls in state foster care \nsystems and girls in state facilities.  \n591.  The interference with and attempted nullification of these state-law \nrights is itself an injury.  \n592.  In addition, Defendants’ actions injure Plaintiff States in a further way: \nby  increasing  the  risk  that  children  under  State  custody  or  control  will  obtain \nabortion drugs by mail, common carrier, or interactive computer service.  \n151 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 195-1   Filed 10/11/24    Page 152 of 199   PageID 9449\nXXII. Economic Injuries to Plaintiffs’ Medical Systems \n593.  In addition to the incalculable toll from the loss of human life, the FDA’s \ndecisions  to  increase  access  to  abortion  drugs  irrespective  of  state  law  inflicts \nsubstantial economic injury on Plaintiff States as the payers or insurers of residents’ \nmedical expenses. The FDA’s deregulatory actions have both caused an increase in \nthe number of pregnant women seeking treatment for abortion drug complications \npaid for by the States and caused a resulting diversion of the States resources from \ntheir general budgets. \n594.  In addition to the immeasurable pain and suffering that their citizens \nsuffer from the FDA’s actions, the States are injured by the FDA’s under-regulation \nof chemical abortion drugs because it causes the States to pay increased medical \nexpenses for women seeking treatment for abortion complications.  \n595.  For  example,  in  2022,  Idaho  Medicaid  alone  expended  at  least \n$12,658.05 in total funds ($3,797.42 state funds and $8,860.64 federal funds) for \ncomplications from abortion drugs.427 This provided coverage for a woman presenting \nwith bleeding following a failed medication abortion: Idaho Medicaid paid for her \nmedically necessary dilation & curettage procedure.428 \n596.  The actual numbers are higher. Given that miscarriage symptoms can \ngreatly resemble symptoms from complications created by abortion drugs, and given \nthat some patients will not disclose the cause of their complications, many procedures \npaid for through state Medicaid programs are not logged as expenses related to \nabortion complications. \n                                            \n427 Ex. 94, Charron Affidavit ¶ 12. \n428 Id. ¶ 14. \n152 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 195-1   Filed 10/11/24    Page 153 of 199   PageID 9450\n597.  Likewise, in 2019, Idaho Medicaid paid at least $10,086.47 in total funds \n($3,025.94 state funds and $7,060.53 federal funds) for treatment and follow-up care \nfor abortion medical complications.429  \n598.  Since mid-2022, Idaho prohibits abortions except to save the life of the \nmother, and so it is highly unlikely that any of these drugs were dispensed by \nprescribers in-person in Idaho.  \n599.  This “effect on the states’ fiscs” is an economic injury for Plaintiff States. \nTexas v. United States, 809 F.3d 134, 152–53 (5th Cir. 2015), as revised (Nov. 25, \n2015); see also, e.g., Biden v. Nebraska, 143 S. Ct. at 2366 (“financial harm is an injury \nin fact”); TransUnion LLC v. Ramirez, 594 U.S. 413, 425 (2021) (“[C]ertain harms \nreadily  qualify  as  concrete  injuries  under  Article  III.  The  most  obvious  are \ntraditional tangible harms, such as physical harms and monetary harms.”).  \n600.  Indeed, “[f]or standing purposes, a loss of even a small amount of money \nis ordinarily an ‘injury,’” Czyzewski v. Jevic Holding Corp., 580 U.S. 451, 464 (2017), \nand here Defendants’ dangerous actions have resulted in the States paying far more \nthan mere pennies in costs for medical care.  \n601.  This satisfies Article III. See California v. Azar, 911 F.3d 558, 571–73 \n(9th Cir. 2018) (finding state had standing based on an injury to its economic interests \nwhere the state was responsible for reimbursing women who seek contraception \nthrough state-run programs).  \n602.  Indeed, suits like this where one entity “challenges the under-regulation \nof another” are well-established.” Corner Post, Inc. v. Bd. of Governors of Fed. Rsrv. \nSys., 144 S. Ct. 2440, 2465 (2024) (Kavanaugh, J., concurring). “One example is the \nCourt’s landmark decision in Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association of United \nStates, Inc. v. State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co., 463 U.S. 29, (1983).” Id. \n                                            \n429 Id. ¶ 11.  \n153 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 195-1   Filed 10/11/24    Page 154 of 199   PageID 9451\n“That case arose when several insurance companies challenged a federal agency's \nrescission of safety standards for new motor vehicles.” Id.  \n603.  Decisions like State Farm show that third-party insurers or payers like \nState Medicaid programs have standing to seek redress from deregulatory actions \nthat injure them economically by resulting in more expenses to be paid through \ninsurance claims. “At no point in that landmark opinion on the judicial review of \nagency actions did the Court state (or need to state) the obvious: Because the agency \ndid not regulate the insurers themselves, the insurers could obtain relief from the \ndownstream effects of the agency’s rescission of the safety standards only if the \ninsurers could obtain vacatur of that rescission.” Id.  \nA.  The FDA’s deregulatory actions predictably lead more and more \npatients  in  Plaintiff  States  to  need  medical  care  for \ncomplications from chemical abortion drugs. \n604.  Abortion suppliers are providing abortion drugs to women from Plaintiff \nStates who travel out of state to obtain abortion drugs and then return home to \ncomplete the process.  \n605.  Defendants’ removal of three in-person doctor visits results in Plaintiff \nStates providing emergency and follow-up care for women who receive abortion drugs \nin other states.  \n606.  For example, although abortion is illegal in Missouri (except for medical \nemergencies), some Missourians obtain abortion drugs by traveling out of State, only \nto return to Missouri where they experience the chemical abortion. These women \nwould then seek follow-up care or emergency services in Missouri.  \n154 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 195-1   Filed 10/11/24    Page 155 of 199   PageID 9452\n607.  In 2022, at least 2,883 Missourians obtained abortions in Kansas. A \nclear majority, 59.6%, of abortions performed in Kansas were chemical abortions.430 \n608.  Unlike with surgical abortions, complications from chemical abortions \ntypically occur when a woman has returned home. The FDA has warned prescribers \nabout this since its approval of abortion drugs in 2000. As the FDA made clear in its \n2000 Approval, “[i]t is important for patients to be fully informed about ... the need \nfor follow up, especially on Day 14 to confirm expulsion.”431  \n609.  In fact, the FDA’s original label emphasized that the Day 14 visit “is \nnecessary”  and  “very  important  to  confirm  by  clinical  examination  or \nultrasonographic scan that a complete termination of pregnancy has occurred.”432  \n610.  The FDA’s Prescriber Agreement also advises that the Day 14 follow-up \nvisit “is very important to confirm that a complete termination of pregnancy has \noccurred and that there have been no complications.”433 This, “[p]atient adherence to \ndirections for use and visits is critical to the drug’s effectiveness and safety.”434 \n611.  But Missouri citizens are thus told “to complete the chemical abortion \nregimen at home,” and the FDA has thus “directed the hundreds of thousands of \nwomen who have complications to seek ‘emergency care’ from” local hospitals at \nhome.

The vast majority of Missourians who obtain chemical abortions in \nKansas or other States complete the chemical regimen in Missouri and, if they \nexperience complications, seek emergency care at facilities in Missouri.    \n613.  Because  of  the  FDA’s  actions  removing  all  in-person  dispensing \nprotection, many women in Plaintiff States like Missouri have also obtained chemical \nabortion drugs through the mail, common carrier, or interactive computer service.  \n614.  The abortion suppliers dispensing drugs to Plaintiff States through the \nmail, common carrier, or interactive computer service are described above, supra Sec. \nXVIII.D. \n615.  Women  then  take  these  drugs  and  suffer  complications  in  Plaintiff \nStates, with no need to travel out-of-state. \nB.  The  FDA’s  deregulatory  actions  lead  to  increased  harm  and \nincreased  medical  care  for  complications  from  chemical \nabortion drugs. \n616.  Plaintiffs’ citizens include women and girls who have suffered and will \nsuffer from complications from the FDA’s unlawful approval of chemical abortion \ndrugs and subsequent elimination of the safeguards previously included with the use \nof chemical abortion drugs. \n617.  Chemical abortion drugs cause women and girls who are citizens of \nPlaintiffs to suffer many intense side effects, including cramping, heavy bleeding, and \nsevere pain. \n618.  The FDA does “not dispute that a significant percentage of women who \ntake mifepristone experience adverse effects.” All. for Hippocratic Med. v. Food & \nDrug Admin., 78 F.4th 210, 229 (5th Cir. 2023), rev’d, 602 U.S. 367 (2024). “FDA has \nacknowledged  that  a  certain  fraction  of  patients  would  require  surgery  due  to \nmiscellaneous complications.” Id. This fraction is about “5-8” percent, according to the \nFDA. Id.  \n156 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 195-1   Filed 10/11/24    Page 157 of 199   PageID 9454\n619.  “Some  women  experience  especially  severe  complications,  such  as \nsepsis ….” Id.  \n620.  “[T]housands of women, and as many as hundreds of thousands, have \nexperienced serious adverse effects as a result of taking the drug, and required \nsurgery or emergency care to treat those effects.” Id. at 230.  \n621.  Women also are told to “complete the chemical abortion regimen at \nhome,” and the FDA has “directed the hundreds of thousands of women who have \ncomplications to seek ‘emergency care’ from” local hospitals near where they live. All. \nfor Hippocratic Med., 2023 WL 2913725, at *8.  \n622.  Because the FDA does not require it, many abortion providers do not \nremain physically near women and girls during the most painful and excruciating \nperiods of the chemical abortion drug regimen, often sending the women and girls \nhome with the drugs.  \n623.  Given  their lack  of admitting  privileges and  treatment  capabilities, \nabortion providers usually instruct women to go to the emergency department of the \nclosest hospital for treatment of any severe adverse events.  \n624.  This practice is consistent with the FDA’s current Medication Guide for \nmifepristone. The FDA directs women to “go to the nearest emergency room” if they \ncannot reach their provider.435 And because remote providers hundreds of miles away \ncannot perform any follow-up care, women are left with one option: the emergency \nroom. \n625.  The FDA’s current Patient Agreement also warns women that a range \nof listed “symptoms” could “require emergency care.”436 \n                                            \n435 Ex. 5, 2023 Mifeprex Label at 16. \n436 Ex. 44, Mifepristone Patient Agreement. \n157 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 195-1   Filed 10/11/24    Page 158 of 199   PageID 9455\n626.  Of those women who end up in the emergency room after taking abortion \ndrugs,  many  suffer  particularly  severe  or  critical  injuries.  Data  for  emergency \ndepartment visits for Medicaid-eligible women following various pregnancy outcomes \nshows that “an [emergency department] visit following a chemical abortion was \nsignificantly more likely to have a severe or critical acuity rating than a visit following \nsurgical abortion, live birth, or an ED visit at any time by a woman who was never \npregnant.”437  \n627.  The study also found that ED visits coded severe or critical for women \nwho underwent a chemical abortion increased by 4,041.1% between 2004 and 2015, \ncompared to a 450.6% increase for surgical abortion subjects and 20.9% for live birth \nsubjects.438  \n628.  Dispensing drugs remotely with no in-person care has higher risks than \nin-person care.  \n629.  Dispensing  drugs  remotely  increases  these  complication  rates  and \nnumber of complications.  \n630.  These higher complication rates, ER rates, and hospitalization rates for \nchemical abortions cause direct economic harms on Plaintiff States in several ways. \n631.  Because of and since Defendants’ actions, the number of women and \ngirls  who  are  citizens  of  Plaintiff  States,  who  have  suffered  complications  from \nchemical abortion, and who have required critical medical treatment has increased \nand will continue to increase. \n                                            \n437  James  Studnicki  et  al.,  Comparative  Acuity  of  Emergency  Department  Visits \nFollowing Pregnancy Outcomes Among Medicaid Eligible Women, 2004-2015, Int’l J. \nEpidemiology  &  Pub.

The  FDA’s  decision  to  expand  the  gestational  age  for  approved \nmifepristone use to 70 days (10 weeks) harms women and girls and increases the \nnumber of chemical abortions and resulting complications. \n633.  The FDA acknowledges that abortion “failure rate” and thus the need \nfor surgical intervention steadily “increase[ ] with ... gestational age.”439  \n634.  The FDA, ACOG, and others have confirmed that the “failure rate” \nclimbs from roughly 2 to 7 percent when moving from seven to ten weeks’ gestation.440 \nThe FDA thus recognizes that up to 7 percent of “women taking Mifeprex will need a \nsurgical procedure” to end the pregnancy, remove retained fetal parts or tissue, or \n“stop bleeding.”441 \n635.  This  expansion  of  the  permissible  gestational  age  is  especially \ndangerous for women and girls when combined with the FDA’s elimination of the in-\nperson dispensing and follow-up visit protections. \n636.  For  example,  without  an  initial  in-person  visit,  women  may \nunderestimate  gestational  age  and  take  the  drugs  past  the  approved  ten-week \nlimit.442 Women beyond ten weeks have higher “chances of complications due to the \nincreased amount of tissue, leading to hemorrhage, infection[,] and/or the need for \nsurgeries or other emergency care.”443 The FDA recently acknowledged that “in-\nperson dispensing avoids the possibility of delay” in taking mifepristone and the \n                                            \n439 Ex. 34, 2021 FDA Response at 9; Ex. 25, Mifeprex 2023 Label at 13.  \n440 Ex. 5, Mifeprex 2023 Label at 13; Ex. 27, ACOG Gestation Bulletin, supra note 54; \nEx. 2, 2016 Summary Review at 29–31. \n441 Ex. 5, Mifeprex 2023 Label at 17; see also Maarit J.

In addition, routine follow-up examination can uncover complications—\nsuch as retained pregnancy tissue—before they become more serious.444 Removing \nthe requirement for those visits naturally results in more women reporting to the \nemergency room or seeking state-provided care. \n638.  The  FDA’s  elimination  of  in-person  drug  administration,  physician \nsupervision,  and  patient  follow-up,  and  its  removal  of  the  in-person  dispensing \nprotection exposes women and girls to increased risk of suffering complications from \nchemical  abortion  and  requiring  further  medical  attention  following  the  drug \nregimen. \n639.  The FDA has eliminated all procedural safeguards that would rule out \nectopic  pregnancies,  verify  gestational  age,  identify  any  contraindications  to \nprescribing  mifepristone,  or  identify  potential  complications  like  sepsis  and \nhemorrhage, remaining fetal parts, and others until the patient is at a critical time \nor  it  is  too  late  to  help  the  patient.  As  a  result,  women  and  girls  often  suffer \nunexpected episodes of heavy bleeding, life-threatening infections, or severe pain and \nmust rush to the emergency department of the nearest hospital. \n640.  The  FDA’s  decision  not  to  require  abortion  providers  to  report  all \nadverse events for chemical abortion drugs harms women and girls who are citizens \nof Plaintiffs because it creates an inaccurate and false safety profile for the use of \nchemical abortion drugs. \n                                            \n444 Ex. 83, Jester Decl. ¶ 25.  \n160 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 195-1   Filed 10/11/24    Page 161 of 199   PageID 9458\n641.  Due  to  inadequate  adverse  event  reporting,  the  true  rates  of  risks \nassociated with chemical abortion drugs remain undercounted and therefore are \nunknown.  \n642.  Because abortion providers cannot know the accurate risk levels that \ntheir patients face when ingesting these drugs, these providers cannot properly \ninform their patients about the risks associated with chemical abortion.  \n643.  This prevents women and girls who are citizens of Plaintiffs from giving \ninformed consent to these providers. This results too in an increased use of abortion \ndrugs and resulting complications.  \n644.  Abortion providers who prescribe or dispense chemical abortion drugs \nto  citizens  of  Plaintiffs  are  not  providing  women  with  an  adequate,  accurate \nassessment of the known risks and effects associated with chemical abortion. \n645.   Therefore, women and girls are unable to give informed consent for the \ndrugs they are receiving, and thus they are not consenting at all to taking the \nchemical abortion drugs—resulting in physical and mental injuries. \n646.  Women  and  girls  often  suffer  distress  and  regret  after  undergoing \nchemical abortion, sometimes seeking to reverse the effects of mifepristone.445  \n647.  A  woman  or  girl  can  experience  these  emotions  and  feelings  upon \nviewing the body of her lifeless baby after taking chemical abortion drugs.446  \n                                            \n445 Ex. 13, Katherine A.

Women and girls who are citizens of Plaintiffs will continue to suffer \ncomplications from chemical abortion drugs. \n653.  Although  abortion  suppliers  have  responded  to  Dobbs  by  no  longer \nsubmitting the required state abortion reports, other data from non-governmental \nsources  shows  that  Defendants’  2021  and  2023  actions  removing  any  in-person \ndispensing protections have harmed Plaintiff States.  \n654.  In Plaintiff States Missouri and Idaho, the baseline for abortions via \nabortion drugs should be low or near zero beginning in mid-2022, when each states’ \nabortion laws were allowed to take effect.  \n655.  As described above, these states allow for abortions only in certain \ncircumstances, and these circumstances (such as the need to save the life of the \nmother) do not occur in high numbers.  \n656.  The non-governmental data nevertheless shows that the number of \nabortions via abortion drugs for Missouri and Idaho residents with no in-person \nfollow-up care is not low and is much higher than zero.  \n657.  These abortions, and the resulting harmful complications, are traceable \nto  Defendants’  2021  and  2023  removal  of  in-person  dispensing  protections. \nDefendants’ removal of in-person dispensing protections allowed these drugs to be \ndispensed in other states without in-person follow-up visits and, significantly, by \nmail, common carrier, or interactive computer service.  \n658.  This lack of in-person dispensing not only results in the use of abortion \ndrugs by state residents, it resulted in an increase in the use of these drugs, and it \nresulted in increased harm to women that leads them to receive follow-up care and \nemergency services in Plaintiff States.  \n659.  Plaintiff States operate Medicaid and other programs to pay medical \nexpenses for reproductive-age women.  \n164 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 195-1   Filed 10/11/24    Page 165 of 199   PageID 9462\n660.

The States operate Medicaid programs to pay medical expenses \nfor reproductive-age women. \n690.  Plaintiff  States’  residents  in  Medicaid  and  other  programs  suffer \nchemical abortions in the absence of FDA safeguards.  \n691.  Combining  the  above  data  from  the  Census  Bureau  about  the \npercentage of women on Medicaid with state health department abortion totals, it is \npossible  to  estimate  the  total  number  of  chemical  abortions  on  state  Medicaid \nenrollees.  \n692.  It is further possible to approximate the number of Medicaid enrollees \nin  each  state  who  will  seek  emergency  care  after  suffering  complications  from \nabortion drugs.  \n693.

(Again,  this  data  is  also  likely  an \nundercount due to reporting inadequacies).

The FDA’s actions result in Plaintiff States’ public insurance \npaying for medical expenses for the increasing number of \npatients suffering abortion-drug complications. \n698.  Abortion has many victims. That is why even though many States like \nMissouri and Idaho do not pay for abortions, they do pay for many medical expenses \nfor women who need treatment after suffering chemical abortions.  \n                                            \n479 Because there is no 2020 data from the U.S. Census Bureau, 2021 data is used.  \n176 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 195-1   Filed 10/11/24    Page 177 of 199   PageID 9474\n699.  Plaintiff  States  pay  for  medical  bills  related  to  abortion-drug \ncomplications when women on public insurance (such as  Medicaid or insurance \nprovided by the State to government workers) obtain chemical abortions and must go \nto the emergency room or hospital in Plaintiff States. \n700.  Sometimes these costs are individually identifiable.  But often they are \nnot because it is often not clear to a physician if a woman is presenting because of a \nnatural miscarriage or a drug-induced abortion.  But it is a statistical certainty that \nwomen  harmed  by  these  drugs  obtain  emergency  services  that  are  paid  for  by \nMedicaid.  \n701.  Even in States that have greatly restricted abortions, women suffer \nsevere complications after taking abortion drugs and must seek emergency medical \nservices.  \n702.  Plaintiff States pay for some of the emergency medical costs associated \nwith chemical abortions for women who are on Medicaid or other public insurance, \nsuch as insurance programs provided to government employees.  \n703.  “Medicaid … is designed to advance cooperative federalism.” Wisconsin \nDep’t of Health and Fam. Services v. Blumer, 534 U.S. 473, 495 (2002). And yet the \nFDA’s actions increase the number of women who must seek emergency medical care, \nincluding care paid for by Medicaid. At the same time that the States have agreed to \noperate a cooperative-federalism program to cover emergency medical costs, the FDA \nhas taken action to drain state resources that go into that program. \n704.  HHS estimates that the average cost of a Medicaid-covered ER visit in \n2017 was $420, a number only set to increase over time due to inflation and increasing \n177 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 195-1   Filed 10/11/24    Page 178 of 199   PageID 9475\nmedical costs.480 Of course, a Medicaid “covered charge” figure may be a fraction of \ntotal costs for that visit.  \n705.  One common method of treating abortion drug complications is a D&C \n(dilation and curettage) to evacuate the contents of the uterus. The costs of a D&C to \nMedicaid may vary by State, by practice setting, and by level of care.  \n706.  According  to  the  state  reimbursement  schedule,  Missouri  Medicaid \nreimburses $2,544.80 for a D&C at an outpatient hospital.481 Missouri Medicaid \nreimburses $227.86 for a D&C in general surgical settings.482 Missouri Medicaid \nreimburses  $316.25  to  $1388.51  for  a  D&C  at  other  service  settings.483  At  an \noutpatient hospital, Missouri Medicaid reimburses $360.52 for an ER visit requiring \na moderate amount of medical decision making and $522.83 for an ER visit requiring \na high amount of medical decision making.484  \n707.

These figures do not include the standard per diem rate for hospital \nstays, if needed. \n711.  Much care for abortion-drug complications and other maternity care is \nbilled for in bundled payments. “A bundled payment is a single, fixed payment for a \ngroup of services provided to treat a condition during a defined episode of care.”490 As \na result, some Medicaid data often may not break down the true costs of care with \nthis level of specificity and may simply describe care as maternity services. \n712.  Each year Plaintiff States expend funds covering expenses associated \nwith medical complications from abortions. \n713.  “For example, in Calendar Year 2022, Idaho Medicaid provided coverage \nfor a woman presenting with bleeding following a failed medication abortion. The \nmedical intervention that was required and that Idaho Medicaid covered was dilation \n& curettage.”491  \n714.  Beginning in 2022, Idaho prohibited abortions except to save the life of \nthe mother, and so it is unlikely that any of these drugs were dispensed by in-person \nprescribers in Idaho. \n715.  “In Calendar Year 2022, Idaho Medicaid expended $12,658.05 in total \nfunds ($3,797.42 state funds and $8,860.64 federal funds) covering treatment and \nfollow-up care for abortion medical complications.”492  \n                                            \n490 MACPAC, Medicaid Payment Initiatives to Improve Maternal and Birth Outcomes \nat  3  (April  2019),  https://www.macpac.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Medicaid-\nPayment-Initiatives-to-Improve-Maternal-and-Birth-Outcomes.pdf. \n491 Ex. 94, Charron Affidavit ¶ 14. \n492 Id. ¶ 12. \n180 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 195-1   Filed 10/11/24    Page 181 of 199   PageID 9478\n716.  This  was  up  from  2019,  when  Idaho  Medicaid  “expended  at  least \n$10,086.47 total funds ($3,025.94 state funds and $7,060.53 federal funds) covering \ntreatment and follow-up care for abortion medical complications.”493 \n717.  These  numbers  likely  understate  the  true  cost  because  chemical \nabortions  routinely  are  miscoded  as  miscarriages.  Chemical  abortions  among \nMedicaid recipients have historically often been misclassified by ER staff as natural \nmiscarriages.  \n718.  Abortion  activists  and  providers  encourage  women  to  mislead  ER \ndoctors by saying they are having a miscarriage.494 It is also possible to estimate how \nmuch Idaho has paid for complications from abortion drugs by applying Idaho’s \ncurrent reimbursement rates to the estimated number of abortion drug complications \nand estimated number of Medicaid-covered D&C’s for abortion drug complications \n(even though these abortion complication reports likely are an undercount).   \nEstimated Medicaid Costs Based on \nTotal Reported Idaho Chemical Abortions Complications by Year \n \nYear  2016  2017  2018  2019  2020  2021  2022  Total \nTotal Reported  5  6  9  10  26  30  9  75 \nChemical Abortion \nComplications \nEstimated  .6  .76  .93  .99  5.17  5.97  1.75  16.17 \nAbortion Drug \nComplications \nCovered by \nMedicaid  \nEstimated  0 to  0 to  0 to  0 to  $262.25  $209.80  $52.45  $839.20 to \nMinimum  $52.45   $52.45   $52.45   $52.45   to  to  to  $891.65 \nPayments for  $314.70  $262.25  $104.9 \n                                            \n493 Id. ¶ 11. \n494 See, e.g., Ex. 11, Will a doctor be able to tell if you’ve taken abortion pills?, Women \nHelp Women (Sept. 23, 2019), https://womenhelp.org/en/page/1093/will-a-doctor-be-\nable-to-tell-if-you-ve-taken-abortion-pills;  Ex.  12,  How  do  you  know  if  you  have \ncomplications  and  what  should  you  do?,  AidAccess, \nhttps://aidaccess.org/en/page/459/how-do-you-know-if-you-have-complications-and-\nwhat-should-you-do (last visited Aug. 28, 2024). \n181 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 195-1   Filed 10/11/24    Page 182 of 199   PageID 9479\nAbortion Drug \nComplications \nCovered by \nMedicaid (at \ncurrent rate of \n$52.45 for a \nminimal \noutpatient visit) \nEstimated Higher  0 to  0 to  0 to  0 to  $1240.60  $1240.60  $248.12  $3,969.92 to \nMedicaid  $248.12  $248.12  $248.12  $248.12  to  to  to  $4,218.04   \nPayments for  $1488.72   $1488.72  $496.24 \nAbortion Drug \nComplications for \nD&C’s (at current \ngeneral setting \nrate of $248.12) \nTotal Chemical  3  4  6  9  22  16  3  50 \nAbortions \nResulting In \nIncomplete \nAbortion Or \nRetained Tissue  \nEstimated D&C’s   .38  .51  .62  .891  4.38  3.18  .58  10.54 \nCovered by \nMedicaid for \nAbortions \nResulting In \nIncomplete \nAbortion Or \nRetained Tissue \nHigh Estimate for  0 to  0 to  0 to  0 to  $992.48  $744.36  0 to  $2,481.20 to \nMedicaid  $248.12   $248.12  $248.12  $248.12  to  to  $248.12  $2,729.32 \nPayments for  $1240.60  $992.48 \nD&C’s for \nAbortions \nResulting In \nIncomplete \nAbortion Or \nRetained Tissue \n(at current general \nsetting rate of \n$248.12)  \nLow Estimate for  0 to  0 to  0 to  0 to  $5002.16  $3751.62  0 to  $12,505.40 \nMedicaid  $1,250.54  $1,250.54  $1,250.54  $1,250.54  to  to  $1,250. to \nPayments for  $6252.70  $5002.16  54  $13,755.94 \nD&C’s  for \nAbortions \nResulting In \nIncomplete \nAbortion Or \nRetained Tissue \n(at current ASC \nrate of $1,250.54) \n719.

Of course, these estimates may be an undercount if actual charges are \nhigher or there is a higher number of patients presenting for treatment.  \n723.  Plaintiff States also pay for the cost of medical bills associated with \nchemical abortion complications when women obtain emergency care out of state. For \nexample, Missouri Medicaid pays for emergency services rendered in other States.497   \n724.  Similarly,  government  employees  can  receive  payments  from \ngovernment health insurance programs for government employees out of state. \n725.  Plaintiff  States  routinely  spend  money  through  public  insurance \ntreating medical complications related to abortion drugs, even in states where such \nabortions are unlawful in most circumstances.  \nE.  States pay costs of public hospitals for medical expenses for the \nincreasing  number  of  patients  in  Plaintiff  States  suffering \ncomplications from chemical abortion drugs. \n726.  Another way that Plaintiff States subsidize healthcare for reproductive-\nage women is through public medical facilities.  \n727.  Each  Plaintiff  State  has  public  and  private  medical  facilities  that \nprovide care for complications from chemical abortion drugs even if the facilities do \nnot provide elective abortions. \n728.  Plaintiff States operate various public hospitals that serve women who \nobtain chemical abortions. The public hospitals act as an arm of the State.  \n729.  In Missouri, public hospitals are ultimately controlled by the State of \nMissouri and receive state funds.  \n730.  MO HealthNet (Missouri Medicaid) pays a determined rate to public \nhospitals, which in some circumstances may be lower than the hospital’s costs.  \n                                            \n497 https://mydss.mo.gov/media/pdf/out-state-non-bordering-services  \n185 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 195-1   Filed 10/11/24    Page 186 of 199   PageID 9483\n731.  Per regulations, those public hospitals agree to accept the payment as \npayment in full, even if it is less than their actual cost. They may not seek further \npayment from the patient.  \n732.  If MO HealthNet pays only a portion of a medical bill, the public hospital \n(an instrumentality of the State) will incur as an expense the difference between the \nfull amount of the medical bill and what was paid. \n733.  If  a  public  hospital  provides  medical  services  for  complications \nstemming from chemical abortions, and the State’s Medicaid program does not cover \nthe full portion of the bill, the outstanding balance is a loss to the public hospital, \nwhich is itself an instrumentality of the State. \n734.  Between January 2018 and August 16, 2023, 55 of the 438 chemical \nabortion complication reports (approximately 1 in 8 of all total chemical abortion \ncomplication reports) were reported by Missouri’s public hospitals.498 \n735.  Under  the  Emergency  Medical  Treatment  and  Active  Labor  Act \n(EMTALA), public hospitals are required to evaluate patients and provide stabilizing \ntreatment in emergency situations, regardless of a patient’s ability to pay. See Moyle \nv.  United  States,  144  S.  Ct.  2015,  2016  (2024)  (Kavanaugh,  J.,  concurring  in \ndismissal).  So, public hospitals cannot choose not to treat women who arrive needing \nemergency treatment after they experience complications from a chemical abortion.  \nF.  The FDA’s actions result in the States paying the costs to public \ninsurance for mental health care for the increasing number of \nwomen suffering negative effects from chemical abortion drugs \n736.  As  with  medical  complications,  Plaintiff  States  also  provide  public \ncoverage of certain mental health expenses such as psychiatry, psychology, and \n                                            \n498 Ex. 95, Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services Affidavit, at 2. \n186 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 195-1   Filed 10/11/24    Page 187 of 199   PageID 9484\ncounseling,  including  through  Medicaid  and  public  insurance  programs  for \ngovernment employees.  \n737.  Post-abortion  regret  and  mental  health  effects  are  common,  as \nevidenced  by  the  proliferation  of  counseling  programs  for  suffering  women  in \nchurches and pregnancy resource centers.  \n738.  Some  women  retrospectively  report  that  they  underwent  abortions \nwithout adequate time to consider their actions or without true informed consent.499 \nAnd a recent U.S. study on abortion and coercion found that “[o]ver 60 percent of \nwomen who had abortions report high levels of pressure to abort from one or more \nsources, and those same women report higher levels of subsequent mental health and \nquality of life issues.”500 \n739.  Chemical abortions in particular have devastating mental health effects \nfor women who experience physical trauma at home and without a doctor or other \nsupport persons present, who often view the unborn child as he or she is aborted, or \nby directly participating in the procedure that ends their child’s life.  \n740.  Seeing the unborn child as it is aborted is associated with more intrusive \nevents  such  as  nightmares,  flashbacks,  and  unwanted  thoughts  related  to  the \nexperience. \n741.  Because women are  the direct actor when they take abortion pills, \n(unlike with surgical abortions, where the physician is the direct actor) women who \n                                            \n499 Ex. 13, Katherine A. Rafferty & Tessa Longbons, #AbortionChangesYou: A Case \nStudy to Understand the Communicative Tensions in Women’s Medication Abortion \nNarratives, 36 Health Commc’n 1485 (2020), DOI: 10.1080/10410236.2020.1770507. \n500 Ex. 106, David C.

Women  who  choose  chemical  abortion  are  more  likely  to  continue \nassociating their homes, or the bathroom, with abortion. The home may become a \ntrigger for uncomfortable emotions rather than a refuge. \n743.  Women who choose chemical abortion over surgical exhibit significantly \nhigher rates of mental health issues, such as obsessive-compulsive symptoms, guilt, \ninterpersonal  sensitivity  issues,  paranoid  ideation,  and  general \npsychological/psychiatric symptoms. \n744.  And mifepristone itself releases inflammatory cytokines, which have \nbeen identified as contributing to depression. In one rat model, the group of pregnant \nrats  given  mifepristone  had  significantly  decreased  body  weight,  food  intake, \nlocomotor-related activity, and sucrose consumption, which are all animal proxies for \ndepression and anxiety.501 \n745.  As a result of these and other factors, women who obtain chemical \nabortions are more likely to seek and need general mental health services, including \nwomen who obtain publicly funded mental health services.  \nXXIII.  Sovereign Injuries to Plaintiffs’ Population Interests \n746.  Plaintiff  States  also  suffer  injuries  from  the  loss  of  fetal  life  and \npotential births, leading to a resulting reduction in the actual or potential population \nof each state.  \n                                            \n501  Ex.  107,  Christina  Camilleri  et  al.,  Biological,  Behavioral  and  Physiological \nConsequences of Drug-Induced Pregnancy Termination at First-Trimester Human \nEquivalent in an Animal Model, 13 Frontiers in Neurosci. 544 (2019). \n188 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 195-1   Filed 10/11/24    Page 189 of 199   PageID 9486\n747.  Defendants’  actions  are  causing  a  loss  in  potential  population  or \npotential population increase. Each abortion represents at least one lost potential or \nactual birth.  \n748.  The Supreme Court has recognized “the legitimacy of the States' interest \nin protecting fetal life.” Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Org., 597 U.S. 215, 262 \n(2022). States’ “legitimate interests include respect for and preservation of prenatal \nlife at all stages of development.” Id. at 301.  \n749.  Defendants’ efforts enabling the remote dispensing of abortion drugs \nhas caused abortions for women in Plaintiff States and decreased births in Plaintiff \nStates. This is a sovereign injury to the State in itself.  \n750.  One study highlighted that the removal of in-person follow-up visits has \nan effect on birth rates. In Missouri, state laws result “in an average increase in \ndriving distance of 2.2 miles” for an in-person out-of-state dispensing of abortion \ndrugs, “compared to a 453-mile increase in Texas, illustrating that states with the \ngreatest  increases  in  driving  distance  also  tend  to  have  the  greatest  estimated \nincreases in births.502 That is because it is relatively easy for a Missouri woman to \ndrive to Illinois or Kansas than for a Texas woman to drive to New Mexico or \nColorado. Reflecting the ease of driving to another state to receive abortion drugs, it \nis estimated that just 2.4 percent of abortion-minded women were prevented from \ngetting abortions” in Missouri after Dobbs.503 This data thus reflects the FDA’s \nremoval of a requirement for three in-person doctor visits.  \n751.  These estimates also show the effect of the FDA’s decision to remove all \nin-person dispensing protections. When data is examined in a way that reflects \n                                            \n502 Daniel Dench et al., The Effects of the Dobbs Decision on Fertility, Inst. of Labor \nEconomics, IZA DP No. 16608 at 12 (Nov. 2023), https://docs.iza.org/dp16608.pdf.  \n503 Id. \n189 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 195-1   Filed 10/11/24    Page 190 of 199   PageID 9487\nsensitivity to expected birth rates, these estimates strikingly “do not show evidence \nof an increase in births to teenagers aged 15-19,” even in states with long driving \ndistances despite the fact that “women aged 15-19 … are more responsive to driving \ndistances to abortion facilities than older women.”504 The study thus concludes that \n“one explanation may be that younger women are more likely to navigate online \nabortion  finders  or  websites  ordering  mail-order  medication  to  self-manage \nabortions.505 This study thus suggests that remote dispensing of abortion drugs by \nmail, common carrier, and interactive computer service is depressing expected birth \nrates for teenaged mothers in Plaintiff States, even if other overall birth rates may \nhave been lower than otherwise was projected. \n752.  A loss of potential population causes further injuries as well: the States \nsubsequent “diminishment of political representation” and “loss of federal funds,” \nsuch as potentially “losing a seat in Congress or qualifying for less federal funding if \ntheir populations are” reduced or their increase diminished. Dep’t of Com. v. New \nYork, 588 U.S. 752, 766–67, (2019). \nXXIV. Injury from 2019 approval of generic mifepristone \n753.  The same is true of the 2019 Generic Approval. By approving a generic \nversion of the drug, the FDA increased supply and availability, lowering cost and thus \nincreasing use of chemical abortions.506  \n754.  As a direct result of the FDA’s decision to approve the 2019 generic \nversion  of  mifepristone,  “third  parties  [have]  react[ed]  in  predictable  ways,” \n                                            \n504 Id. \n505 Id. \n506 Ex. 108, Solanky Affidavit. \n190 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 195-1   Filed 10/11/24    Page 191 of 199   PageID 9488\nincreasing the use of chemical abortion compared to surgical abortion. Dep’t of Com. \nv. New York, 139 S. Ct. 2551, 2566 (2019). \n755.  The number of women obtaining chemical abortions has increased as a \nresult  of  the  2019  generic  approval,507  and  thus  the  “the  number  of  women \nexperiencing medical complications after taking mifepristone has risen as a result of \nthe generic” approval, All. for Hippocratic Med. v. U.S. Food & Drug Admin., 78 F.4th \n210, 241 (5th Cir. 2023). \n756.  Because Plaintiff States experience harm, as explained below, from the \nuse of chemical abortions, the 2019 generic approval aggravates and worsens Plaintiff \nStates’ harms. \nFIRST CLAIM \n \nThe Challenged 2016 Major Changes \n \nUltra Vires; Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. § 706)  \n \nIn Excess of Statutory Jurisdiction, Authority, or Limitations, or Short of \nStatutory Right; Arbitrary, Capricious, An Abuse of Discretion, or \nOtherwise Not in Accordance with Law \n757.  Plaintiffs  re-allege  and  incorporate,  as  though  fully  set  forth, \nparagraphs 1 to 756 of this complaint. \n758.  The FDA lacked legal authority when issuing the challenged 2016 Major \nChanges.  \n759.  The FDA’s illegal and unreasonable rationales for the challenged 2016 \nMajor Changes—in light of the political context of the agency’s actions—indicate that \nthe stated reasons are pretext. Therefore, they are arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of \ndiscretion, and otherwise not in accordance with law in violation of the APA. 5 U.S.C. \n§ 706(2)(A). \n                                            \n507 Id. \n191 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 195-1   Filed 10/11/24    Page 192 of 199   PageID 9489\n760.  The challenged 2016 Major Changes were unlawful because the FDA \nacknowledged that they were “interrelated,” but failed to explain why the agency did \nnot consider the cumulative impact of removing them all at once or why the agency \ncould extrapolate safety conclusions for its omnibus changes from studies that did not \nevaluate those changes as a whole. \n761.  The FDA’s actions seek to enable the violation of state laws restricting \nabortion, as described above. But a federal agency cannot disregard applicable state \nlaw or seek to enable and encourage what state law expressly prohibits, so the FDA \nlacked  legal  authority  and  acted  arbitrarily  and  capriciously  when  issuing  the \nchallenged 2016 Major Changes.  \n762.  Therefore, the challenged 2016 Major Changes, and, by necessity, the \n2019 Mifepristone REMS Program and the 2021/2023 Removal of the In-Person \nDispensing  Protection  must  be  held  unlawful,  stayed,  set  aside,  vacated,  and \npreliminarily and permanently enjoined under the APA and the Court’s inherent \nequitable power to enjoin ultra vires actions, Larson, 337 U.S. at 689–91. \nSECOND CLAIM \n2019 MIFEPRISTONE REMS PROGRAM AND 2019 ANDA APPROVAL \nULTRA VIRES; ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT (5 U.S.C. § 706)  \n \nIN EXCESS OF STATUTORY JURISDICTION, AUTHORITY, OR \nLIMITATIONS, OR SHORT OF STATUTORY RIGHT; ARBITRARY, \nCAPRICIOUS, AN ABUSE OF DISCRETION, OR OTHERWISE NOT IN \nACCORDANCE WITH LAW \n763.  Plaintiffs  re-allege  and  incorporate,  as  though  fully  set  forth, \nparagraphs 1 to 762 of this complaint. \n764.  The FDA lacked legal authority when issuing the 2019 Mifepristone \nShared REMS Program and 2019 ANDA Approval. \n192 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 195-1   Filed 10/11/24    Page 193 of 199   PageID 9490\n765.  The FDA’s illegal and unreasonable rationales for the 2019 Mifepristone \nShared REMS Program and 2019 ANDA Approval—in light of the political context of \nthe agency’s actions—indicate that the stated reasons are pretext. Therefore, they \nare arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, and otherwise not in accordance with \nlaw in violation of the APA. 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \n766.  The FDA’s actions seek to enable the violation of state laws restricting \nabortion, as described above. But a federal agency cannot disregard applicable state \nlaw or seek to enable and encourage what state law expressly prohibits, so the FDA \nlacked legal authority and acted arbitrarily and capriciously when issuing the 2019 \nMifepristone Shared REMS Program and 2019 ANDA Approval.  \n767.  Therefore,  the  2019  Mifepristone  Shared  REMS  Program  and  2019 \nANDA Approval must be held unlawful, stayed, set aside, vacated, and preliminarily \nand permanently enjoined under the APA and the Court’s inherent equitable power \nto enjoin ultra vires actions, Larson, 337 U.S. at 689–91. \nTHIRD CLAIM \n2021/2023 REMOVAL OF THE IN-PERSON DISPENSING PROTECTION, \nINCLUDING THE PHARMACY AUTHORIZATION \nULTRA VIRES; ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT (5 U.S.C. § 706)  \n \nIN EXCESS OF STATUTORY JURISDICTION, AUTHORITY, OR \nLIMITATIONS, OR SHORT OF STATUTORY RIGHT; ARBITRARY, \nCAPRICIOUS, AN ABUSE OF DISCRETION, OR OTHERWISE NOT IN \nACCORDANCE WITH LAW \n768.  Plaintiffs  re-allege  and  incorporate,  as  though  fully  set  forth, \nparagraphs 1 to 767 of this complaint. \n769.  The FDA lacked legal authority when issuing the 2021/2023 Removal of \nthe  In-Person  Dispensing  Protection  (consisting  of  the  2021  Non-Enforcement \n193 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 195-1   Filed 10/11/24    Page 194 of 199   PageID 9491\nDecision, the 2023 Removal of In-Person Dispensing Requirement, and the Pharmacy \nAuthorization). \n770.  The FDA’s 2021/2023 Removal of the In-Person Dispensing Protection \nviolates the federal laws that expressly prohibit the mailing or delivery by any letter \ncarrier,  express  company,  or  other  common  carrier,  or  by  interactive  computer \nservice, of any substance or drug intended for producing abortion. 18 U.S.C. §§ 1461–\n62. \n771.  The FDA’s 2021/2023 Removal of the In-Person Dispensing Protection \nviolated  these  federal  laws  because  they  impermissibly  removed  the  in-person \ndispensing  requirement  for  abortion  drugs  and,  accordingly,  authorized  the \ndownstream distribution of abortion drugs by mail, express company, other common \ncarriers, and interactive computer service. \n772.  Because a federal agency cannot permit what federal law expressly \nprohibits, the FDA lacked legal authority when issuing the 2021/2023 Removal of the \nIn-Person Dispensing Protection. \n773.  The  FDA’s  illegal  and  unreasonable  rationales  for  the  2021/2023 \nRemoval of the In-Person Dispensing Protection —in light of the political context of \nthe agency’s actions—indicate that the stated reasons are pretext. Therefore, they \nare arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, and otherwise not in accordance with \nlaw in violation of the APA. 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \n774.  The 2021/2023 Removal of the In-Person Dispensing Protection are also \nunlawful because they were based on adverse event data that the FDA elsewhere \nrecognizes as unreliable and studies that it considered “not adequate” on their own \nto establish the safety of dispensing mifepristone by mail. \n775.  The FDA’s actions seek to enable the violation of state laws restricting \nabortion, as described above. But a federal agency cannot disregard applicable state \nlaw or seek to enable and encourage what state law expressly prohibits, so the FDA \n194 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 195-1   Filed 10/11/24    Page 195 of 199   PageID 9492\nlacked  legal  authority  and  acted  arbitrarily  and  capriciously  when  issuing  the  \n2021/2023 Removal of the In-Person Dispensing Protection.  \n776.  Therefore,  the  2021/2023  Removal  of  the  In-Person  Dispensing \nProtection must be held unlawful, stayed, set aside, vacated, and preliminarily and \npermanently enjoined under the APA and the Court’s inherent equitable power to \nenjoin ultra vires actions, Larson, 337 U.S. at 689–91. \nFOURTH CLAIM \n \nThe Challenged 2016 Major Changes \n \nAdministrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. § 706) \n \nIn Excess of Statutory Jurisdiction, Authority, or Limitations, or Short of \nStatutory Right; Arbitrary, Capricious, An Abuse of Discretion, of \nOtherwise Not in Accordance with Law \n777.  Plaintiffs  re-allege  and  incorporate,  as  though  fully  set  forth,  all \nparagraphs 1 to 776 of this complaint. \n778.  Defendants lacked legal authority to make the 2016 Major Changes. \n779.  The FDA lacked legal authority under PREA to make the challenged \n2016 Major Changes, and the challenged 2016 Major Changes were in excess of \nstatutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right, and were \narbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, and not in accordance with law, because \nPREA allows the FDA to extrapolate from studies of adult populations only if the \ncourse of a “disease” is substantially similar in adults and the pediatric population. \nBecause pregnancy is not a disease, PREA did not permit the FDA to make such an \nextrapolation. \n780.  Defendants lacked legal authority under PREA to make the challenged \n2016  Major Changes and the challenged 2016 Major Changes were in excess of \nstatutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right, and were \n195 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 195-1   Filed 10/11/24    Page 196 of 199   PageID 9493\narbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, and not in accordance with law, because \nthe FDA did not require an assessment that evaluated the safety and effectiveness of \nmifepristone for girls under 18 years of age. \n781.  For the reasons stated above, the challenged 2016 Major Changes must \nbe held unlawful, stayed, set aside, vacated, and  preliminarily and permanently \nenjoined. \n782.  Because the challenged 2016 Major Changes were unlawful, the FDA’s \n2019 action to create a single, shared REMS—the Mifepristone REMS Program—for \nboth Mifeprex and generic mifepristone must also be held unlawful, stayed, set aside, \nvacated, and preliminarily and permanently enjoined. \nFIFTH CLAIM \n \n2019 Abbreviated New Drug Approval \n \nAdministrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. § 706) \n \nIn Excess of Statutory Jurisdiction, Authority, or Limitations, or Short of \nStatutory Right; Arbitrary, Capricious, An Abuse Of Discretion, or \nOtherwise Not in Accordance with Law \n783.  Plaintiffs  re-allege  and  incorporate,  as  though  fully  set  forth,  all \nparagraphs 1 to 782 of this complaint. \n784.  Defendants lacked legal authority to issue the 2019 ANDA Approval. \n785.  Because the FDA relied on the unlawful 2016 Major Changes labeling \nas a means to approve GenBioPro’s generic drug, Mifepristone Tablets, 200 mg, the \n2019 ANDA Approval was unlawfully approved. \n786.  Unable to rely on an unlawful approval, the FDA’s 2019 ANDA Approval \nviolated the FDCA because it lacked the clinical investigations, adequate testing, \nsufficient information, and substantial evidence to show the safety and effectiveness \n196 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 195-1   Filed 10/11/24    Page 197 of 199   PageID 9494\nof mifepristone under the conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in \nthe proposed labeling thereof as required by 21 U.S.C. § 355(d). \n787.  Therefore, the 2019 ANDA Approval must be held unlawful, set aside, \nvacated, and preliminarily and permanently enjoined.  \n788.  GenBioPro may submit an application with proposed labeling consistent \nwith the pre-2016 Major Changes labeling, but, unlike Danco, GenBioPro cannot \nsimply revert to a previously approved label. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nFor these reasons, Plaintiff States respectfully request that the Court enter an \norder  and  judgment  against  Defendants,  including  their  employees,  agents, \nsuccessors, and all persons in active concert or participation with them, in which it: \nA.  Issues a preliminary injunction or a stay of the effective dates that  \n1.  reinstates the REMS that were in place before 2016 insofar as \nthey restore the Day 3 and Day 14 follow-up visits, restore the \ngestational age to 7 weeks from 10 weeks, restore the requirement \nthat prescribers be physicians, and restore the requirement that \nprescribers must report all serious non-fatal adverse events to the \nagency;  \n2.  rescinds the 2019 generic approval; and \n3.  restores the in-person dispensing requirement. \nB.  Issues  a  permanent  injunction  ordering  Defendants  to  withdraw \nDefendants’ actions to deregulate these abortion drugs. \nC.  Holds  unlawful,  sets  aside,  and  vacates  the  challenged  2016  Major \nChanges. \n197 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 195-1   Filed 10/11/24    Page 198 of 199   PageID 9495\nD.  Holds unlawful, sets aside, and vacates the 2019 ANDA Approval. \nE.  Holds unlawful, sets aside, and vacates the 2021/2023 Removal of the \nIn-Person  Dispensing  Protection,  including  the  Pharmacy \nAuthorization. \nF.  Holds unlawful the provision of drugs to adolescent populations because \nthe  FDA  lacked  authority  under  §  355c(a)(2)(B)(i)  to  extrapolate \npediatric effectiveness. \nG.  Declares that the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act prohibits the \nFDA from relying exclusively on studies that fail to evaluate the safety \nof interrelated changes in the proposed labeling thereof when reviewing \nand approving a supplemental new drug application without explaining \nwhy it was permissible to do so. \nH.  Declares that 18 U.S.C. § 1461 and 18 U.S.C. § 1462 prohibit the FDA \nfrom approving a supplemental new drug application that fails to limit \ndistribution of abortion drugs in accordance with these laws. \nI.  Retains jurisdiction of this matter for the purpose of enforcing this \nCourt’s order. \nJ.  Awards Plaintiffs’ costs, attorneys’ fees, and other disbursements for \nthis action. \nK.

The United States Food and \nDrug Administration approved mifepristone for use in 2000 under the brand \nname Mifeprex. At the same time, FDA imposed a number of conditions de-\nsigned to prevent the drug from causing serious medical side effects.  FDA \namended those conditions in 2016, generally lightening the prior protections.  \nIt then approved a generic version in 2019.  And in 2021, FDA announced \nthat it would not enforce an agency regulation requiring mifepristone to be \nprescribed and dispensed in person.  The agency ultimately removed that re-\nquirement from mifepristone’s conditions for use. \nThe subject of this appeal is those four actions: the 2000 Approval, \n2016 Amendments, 2019 Generic Approval, and 2021 Non-Enforcement De-\ncision.  They are challenged by the Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine—an \nassociation of doctors who research, teach, and advocate for ethical medical \npractices—several similar organizations, and several individual doctors.  At \nbottom, the Medical Organizations and Doctors contend that FDA over-\nlooked important safety risks in approving mifepristone and amending its re-\nstrictions.  They assert that FDA’s actions were unlawful under the Admin-\nistrative Procedure Act.   \nThe Organizations seek relief on behalf of their members, many of \nwhom are OB/Gyns or emergency-room doctors.  Many women face severe \ncomplications as a result of taking mifepristone.  The Doctors allege that they \n2 \n\nCase: 23-10362      Document: 543-1     Page: 3     Date Filed: 08/16/2023\nNo. 23-10362 \nare harmed when they treat those kinds of patients. \nAccording to the Doctors, when they treat women who are experienc-\ning complications after taking mifepristone, they are required to perform or \ncomplete an abortion, or otherwise required to participate in a process that \nfacilitates abortion.  They maintain that personally conducting those proce-\ndures violates their sincerely held moral beliefs.  The Doctors also contend \nthat treatment of mifepristone patients diverts time and resources away from \ntheir ordinary patients, causes substantial mental and emotional distress, and \nexposes them to heightened malpractice risk and increased insurance costs. \nSeeking to prevent those alleged injuries, the Medical Organizations \nand Doctors moved for preliminary injunctive relief.  The district court \ngranted the motion, but rather than entering a traditional injunction, the \ncourt stayed the effective date of each of the challenged actions under 5 \nU.S.C. § 705.  FDA appealed, as did Intervenor Danco Laboratories, LLC, \nthe pharmaceutical company that distributes Mifeprex. \nAfter extensive briefing and oral argument, we hold that the district \ncourt’s stay order should be VACATED in part and AFFIRMED in part.  \nWe conclude that the Medical Organizations and Doctors’ claim as to the \n2000 Approval is likely barred by the statute of limitations.  Accordingly, that \ncomponent of the district court’s order must be VACATED.  This means \nthat, until final judgment, Mifeprex will remain available to the public under \nthe conditions for use that existed in 2016. \nWe also VACATE the portion of the order relating to the 2019 Ge-\nneric Approval because the Medical Organizations and Doctors have not \nshown that they are injured by that particular action.  The generic version of \nmifepristone will also be available under the same conditions as Mifeprex. \nWe AFFIRM the components of the stay order that concern the 2016 \nAmendments and the 2021 Non-Enforcement Decision.  Those agency ac-\n3 \n\nCase: 23-10362      Document: 543-1     Page: 4     Date Filed: 08/16/2023\nNo. 23-10362 \ntions—which generally loosen the protections and regulations relating to the \nuse of mifepristone—will be stayed during the pendency of this litigation. \nFinally, we note that our holding is subject to the prior order of the \nSupreme Court, which stayed the district court’s order pending resolution of \nthis appeal and disposition of any petition for writ of certiorari.  Danco Lab’ys, \nLLC v. All. for Hippocratic Med., 143 S. Ct. 1075 (2023) (mem.). \nI. Background \nThis case arises under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and \nrelated amendments.  21 U.S.C. ch. 9.  The Department of Health and Hu-\nman Services is charged with responsibility for implementing that law, and \nhas delegated that obligation to FDA, its subagency.  Id. § 393.  The relevant \nevents center on the particular duty of approving new drugs. \nThe approval process begins with a new drug application.  Id. § 355(a).  \nAt this stage, it is the applicant’s burden to prove that the proposed drug is \nsafe and effective.  The Act directs FDA to deny a new drug application if, \namong other reasons, the applicant fails to include tests and data that show \nthat the drug “is safe for use under the conditions prescribed, recommended, \nor suggested in the proposed labeling”; if “any other information” before \nFDA tends to show that the drug is not safe; or if “there is a lack of substan-\ntial evidence that the drug will have the effect it purports or is represented to \nhave under the conditions for use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in \nthe proposed labeling thereof.”  Id. § 355(d); see 21 C.F.R. § 314.125 (regula-\ntions expanding on those requirements). \nCertain new drug applications may be designated for “accelerated ap-\nproval.”  21 C.F.R. § 314 subpt. H.  This category applies to drugs treating \n“serious or life-threatening illnesses” and that “provide meaningful thera-\npeutic benefit to patients over existing treatments.”  Id. § 314.500.  The reg-\nulations also require FDA to impose “postmarketing restrictions” where \n4 \n\nCase: 23-10362      Document: 543-1     Page: 5     Date Filed: 08/16/2023\nNo. 23-10362 \nnecessary to ensure the drug is used safely.  Id. § 314.520(a).  Relevant here, \nthe agency may mandate that the drug be administered at “certain facilities \nor [by] physicians with special training or experience,” or that “specified \nmedical procedures” be used.  Id. § 314.520(a)(1), (a)(2). \n FDA has explained that it will consider accelerated approval in two \nsituations: where the agency can reliably estimate effectiveness using a “sur-\nrogate endpoint”; and where FDA “determines that a drug, effective to the \ntreatment of a disease, can be used safely only if distribution or use is modi-\nfied or restricted.”  57 Fed. Reg. 58942, 58942 (Dec. 11, 1992).  The agency \nhas understood approval under Subpart H as also satisfying the general ap-\nproval conditions provided by the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.  See id. \n(“Drugs or biological products approved under these procedures will have \nmet the requisite standards for safety and effectiveness under the [Act] . . . \nand, thus, will have full approval for marketing.”). \nIn March of 1996, an entity known as the Population Council applied \nfor FDA to approve mifepristone as a new drug, as part of a two-drug regimen \ndesigned to cause abortion.1  The regimen works like this:  First, a pregnant \nwoman takes mifepristone, which suppresses the production of the hormone \nprogesterone.  Progesterone is needed for the pregnancy to continue; it pre-\npares and maintains the uterine lining and stimulates the production of nutri-\nents.  After taking mifepristone, a patient takes misoprostol, which causes the \nuterus to cramp and expel its contents. \nAs part of the new drug application, the Population Council relied on \nthree clinical studies, one conducted in the United States and two conducted \n_____________________ \n1 The Population Council is a non-profit organization.  Roussel Uclaf—the French \npharmaceutical company that originally developed mifepristone—donated the American \npatent rights to the Population Council in 1994.  The Population Council then granted \nDanco an exclusive license to manufacture and distribute Mifeprex in the United States. \n5 \n\nCase: 23-10362      Document: 543-1     Page: 6     Date Filed: 08/16/2023\nNo. 23-10362 \nin France.  The studies purported to show that mifepristone was effective in \nthe majority of cases, under the conditions imposed in each study.  Those \nconditions included: an ultrasound to verify gestational age and diagnose ec-\ntopic pregnancies; that prescribing physicians have experience performing \nsurgical abortions and have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital; that the \ntesting facilities be located close to a local hospital; and a four-hour monitor-\ning period after taking misoprostol. \nAlthough mifepristone was effective for most patients, the studies \nshowed a trend of adverse events for some women.  According to FDA, “sur-\ngical intervention” was required in 7.9% of the subjects in the American trial \nand 4.5% of subjects in the French trials.  The reasons for surgery included \nheavy bleeding, infection, incomplete abortion, and ongoing pregnancy—\nmeaning that the embryo or fetus continued to grow and develop.   \nFDA approved the new drug application in September 2000.  The let-\nters that the agency sent to the Population Council explained that the ap-\nproval was “under Subpart H.”  FDA Approval Memorandum to Population \nCouncil at 6 (Sept. 28, 2000).  This was for two reasons.  First, FDA under-\nstood Mifeprex to be a drug that treated a serious or life threatening illness.  \nId. (“FDA has determined that the termination of an unwanted pregnancy is \na serious condition within the scope of Subpart H.  The meaningful therapeu-\ntic benefit over existing surgical abortion is the avoidance of a surgical proce-\ndure.”).  And second, Subpart H was required because Mifeprex could not \nbe administered safely without imposing certain use restrictions.  Id. (“Sub-\npart H applies when FDA concludes that a drug product shown to be effec-\ntive can be safely used only if distribution or use is restricted . . . .”). \nIn order to address the safety risks discussed above, FDA imposed \nseveral safeguards.  First, it required the following black-box warning: \n6 \n\nCase: 23-10362      Document: 543-1     Page: 7     Date Filed: 08/16/2023\nNo. 23-10362 \nIf Mifeprex results in incomplete abortion, surgical interven-\ntion may be necessary.  Prescribers should determine in ad-\nvance  whether  they  will  provide  such  care  themselves  or \nthrough other providers.  Prescribers should also give patients \nclear instructions of whom to call and what to do in the event \nof an emergency following administration of Mifeprex.  \nApproval Memorandum at 2.  FDA also set the following controls on the use \nand prescription of Mifeprex: \n  Only women whose pregnancies have a gestational age of \nforty-nine days or less are eligible; \n  Only physicians can prescribe Mifeprex; \n  All prescribing physicians must be able to assess gestational \nage, diagnose ectopic pregnancies, and “provide surgical \nintervention  in  cases  of  incomplete  abortion  or  severe \nbleeding” or have arranged for another physician to provide \nsuch care; \n  Prescription must occur in person; and \n  Prescribers must report any “hospitalization, transfusion, \nor other serious event[] to the sponsor.” \nId. at 1, 6.  Finally, FDA required three doctor’s-office visits, which are sum-\nmarized as follows.  The patient first takes mifepristone at the doctor’s office.  \nThree days later, she returns to the office to take misoprostol.  Finally, the \npatient visits the doctor for a follow-up appointment, to determine whether \nthe drug has successfully terminated the pregnancy and to screen for any ad-\nverse effects. \nIn August of 2002, the American Association of Pro-Life Obstetri-\ncians and Gynecologists (a party to the instant case) and several other similar \norganizations filed a citizen petition, asking FDA to revoke its approval of \nmifepristone.  See 21 C.F.R. § 10.30.  The petition argued that mifepristone \nwas not safe to use under the approved conditions.  FDA reviewed the peti-\n7 \n\nCase: 23-10362      Document: 543-1     Page: 8     Date Filed: 08/16/2023\nNo. 23-10362 \ntion over the next fourteen years, ultimately denying it in 2016. \n Two significant developments occurred in the meantime.  First, in \n2007, Congress amended the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.  See Food and \nDrug Administration Amendments Act of 2007, Pub. L. No. 110-85, tit. IX, \n§ 901, 121 Stat. 823, 922–43.  The amendment authorizes FDA to require a \n“risk evaluation and mitigation strategy” (REMS) if it determines that such \na strategy is “necessary to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the \nrisks of the drug.”  21 U.S.C. § 355-1(a)(1).  The Act further allowed FDA to \nimpose use restrictions via the REMS, like physician qualifications or report-\ning requirements.  Id. § 355-1(f).  The law also regarded all drugs approved \nbefore the Act as having an approved REMS.  See Amendments Act § 909(b), \n121 Stat. at 950 (“A drug that was approved before the effective date of this \nAct is . . . deemed to have in effect an approved risk evaluation and mitigation \nstrategy under section 505-1 of the [Act].”).  \nThen in 2011, FDA approved a REMS for mifepristone, imposing es-\nsentially the same restrictions as those FDA required when it approved Mif-\neprex in 2000.  The REMS included four essential parts: a general summary, \nmedication guide, prescriber agreement, and patient agreement.  The medi-\ncation guide explains how to use mifepristone and the risks associated with \ndoing so.  Mifepristone REMS at 4–6 (June 8, 2011).  The prescriber agree-\nment requires prescribers to promise to follow FDA’s restrictions.  Id. at 7–\n8.  And the patient agreement is a form that women must sign prior to using \nmifepristone; it obliges a patient to confirm that she meets the conditions for \nusing mifepristone and acknowledge the risk of adverse events.  Id. at 9–10.  \nThe mifepristone REMS was later amended in several respects.  But its gen-\neral form—the summary, medical guide, prescriber’s agreement, and patient \nagreement—remains the same. \nIn 2016, FDA addressed Mifeprex in two respects.  First, it denied the \n8 \n\nCase: 23-10362      Document: 543-1     Page: 9     Date Filed: 08/16/2023\nNo. 23-10362 \n2002 citizen petition, defending Mifeprex’s safety and effectiveness as ap-\nproved in 2000.  Second, FDA approved a supplemental new drug applica-\ntion by Danco.  That application requested a number of amendments to Mif-\neprex’s REMS that FDA described as “major” and “interrelated.”  FDA \nSummary Review of 2016 Amendments at 5 (Mar. 29, 2016).  Those changes \nincluded: \n  Increasing the maximum gestational age from forty-nine \ndays to seventy days; \n  Allowing non-physicians to prescribe mifepristone; \n  Removing the requirement that the administration of miso-\nprostol and the subsequent follow-up appointment be con-\nducted in person; \n  Eliminating prescribers’ obligation to report non-fatal ad-\nverse events;  \n  Switching the method of administration for misoprostol \nfrom oral to buccal; and \n  Changing the dose of mifepristone (600 mg to 200 mg) and \nmisoprostol (400 mcg to 800 mcg). \nId. at 2, 26.  FDA also pointed to a number of studies as evidence that Mif-\neprex would be safe and effective despite the amendments.  Id. at 5–17. \nSeveral years later, in 2019, the American Association of Pro-Life Ob-\nstetricians and Gynecologists and American College of Pediatricians filed a \ncitizen petition challenging the 2016 Amendments.  The petition generally \nrequested that FDA restore the restrictions it imposed in 2000.  Separately, \nin April of 2019, FDA approved an “abbreviated new drug application” by \nGenBioPro, Inc. for a generic version of mifepristone.  To assess whether the \ndrug was safe, the agency relied on the same data that it had relied upon for \nthe 2000 Approval and 2016 Amendments regarding Mifeprex.  \n9 \n\nCase: 23-10362      Document: 543-1     Page: 10     Date Filed: 08/16/2023\nNo. 23-10362 \nFDA then took several notable steps in 2021.  In April, it announced \nthat, in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, the agency would not en-\nforce the in-person dispensing requirement.  Effectively, this allowed mife-\npristone to be prescribed remotely and sent via mail.   \n[FDA] intends to exercise enforcement discretion during the \nCOVID-19 [pandemic] with respect to the in-person dispens-\ning requirement of the Mifepristone REMS Program, including \nany in-person requirements that may be related to the Patient \nAgreement Form.  Further . . . [FDA] intends to exercise en-\nforcement discretion during the COVID-19 [pandemic] with \nrespect to the dispensing of mifepristone through the mail ei-\nther by or under the supervision of a certified prescriber, or \nthrough a mail-order pharmacy when such dispensing is done \nunder the supervision of a certified prescriber. \nFDA Letter to American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists at 2 \n(Apr. 12, 2021).  Later that year, FDA stated that it would adopt the change \non a permanent basis.  It then amended mifepristone’s REMS (which applies \nto Mifeprex and the generic version) in January of 2023 to formalize the re-\nmoval of the in-person dispensing requirement.  FDA Br. at 11. \nFinally, in December of 2021, FDA denied the 2019 citizen petition.  \nAccording to FDA, the agency “undertook a full review of the Mifepristone \nREMS Program” and ultimately concluded that the drug was safe to use as \namended.  FDA Denial Letter to American College of Obstetricians and Gy-\nnecologists at 6 (Dec. 16, 2021).  FDA specifically addressed its reasons for \nremoving the in-person dispensing requirement.  Id. at 25–36. \n*  *  * \nAgainst this background, the Medical Organizations and Doctors filed \nthe instant complaint in district court.  As relevant here, they alleged that \neach FDA action—the 2000 Approval, 2016 Amendments, 2019 Generic \n10 \n\nCase: 23-10362      Document: 543-1     Page: 11     Date Filed: 08/16/2023\nNo. 23-10362 \nApproval, and 2021 Non-Enforcement Decision—violates the Administra-\ntive Procedure Act.  Danco intervened to represent its interest as the manu-\nfacturer and distributor of Mifeprex in the United States.  GenBioPro filed \nan amicus brief before this court but did not intervene or otherwise participate \nin the litigation, either in the district court or on appeal. \nThe Medical Organizations and Doctors filed a motion for a prelimi-\nnary injunction.  The district court held a hearing on the matter and granted \nthe motion in part.  All. for Hippocratic Med. v. FDA, __ F. Supp. 3d __, 2023 \nWL 2825871 (N.D. Tex. Apr. 7, 2023).  For relief, the court “stayed” the \n“effective date” of FDA’s actions under 5 U.S.C. § 705. \nFDA and Danco appealed and moved to stay the district court’s order \npending appeal.  A motions panel of this court stayed the district court’s or-\nder in part.  All. for Hippocratic Med. v. FDA, No. 23-10362, 2023 WL 2913725 \n(5th Cir. Apr. 12, 2023).  The panel stayed the portion of the district court’s \norder relating to the 2000 Approval but did not disturb the other components \nof the order—regarding the 2016 Amendments, 2019 Generic Approval, and \n2021 Non-Enforcement Decision.  FDA and Danco then applied to the Su-\npreme Court for a full stay of the district court’s order, which was granted.  \nDanco Lab’ys, LLC v. All. for Hippocratic Med., 143 S. Ct. 1075 (2023) (mem.).  \nThe Court further provided that its stay of the district court’s order would \nextend through the request for a petition for certiorari, if any: \nThe April 7, 2023 order of the United States District Court for \nthe  Northern  District  of  Texas,  case  No.  2:22–cv–223,  is \nstayed pending disposition of the appeal in the United States \nCourt of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit and disposition of a peti-\ntion for a writ of certiorari, if such a writ is timely sought.  \nShould certiorari be denied, this stay shall terminate automati-\ncally.  In the event certiorari is granted, the stay shall terminate \nupon the sending down of the judgment of this Court. \n11 \n\nCase: 23-10362      Document: 543-1     Page: 12     Date Filed: 08/16/2023\nNo. 23-10362 \nId. at 1075.  The parties then fully briefed the ultimate question of whether \nthe district court erred in issuing the stay order.  Over thirty amici filed sepa-\nrate briefs on various topics.  Oral argument was held on May 17, 2023, in \nwhich each side was allowed forty minutes to present its argument, double \nthe ordinary allotted time.  We now consider the merits of the appeal. \nII. Standing \nBefore considering the Medical Organizations and Doctors’ claims, \nwe must determine whether they have standing to assert them; an injunction \nis always improper if the district court lacked jurisdiction.  Cruz v. Abbott, \n849 F.3d 594, 598–99 (5th Cir. 2017).  At this stage, it is the plaintiffs’ burden \nto “make a ‘clear showing’ that they have standing to maintain the prelimi-\nnary injunction.”  Barber v. Bryant, 860 F.3d 345, 352 (5th Cir. 2017) (quoting \nWinter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 22 (2008)).  And so the \nMedical Organizations and Doctors must satisfy the three basic elements of \nstanding: injury, traceability, and redressability.  Lujan v. Defs. of Wildlife, \n504 U.S. 555, 560 (1992). \nStanding in this appeal turns principally on the “injury” prong.  The \nMedical Organizations and Doctors seek prospective relief, so they must es-\ntablish future injury.  To do that, they must show that “the threatened injury \nis ‘certainly impending,’ or there is a ‘substantial risk’ that the harm will oc-\ncur.”  Susan B. Anthony List v. Driehaus, 573 U.S. 149, 158 (2014) (quoting \nClapper v. Amnesty Int’l USA, 568 U.S. 398, 414 n.5 (2013)).  As those stand-\nards indicate, the plaintiffs must show that the threat of future injury is suffi-\nciently likely.  The Supreme Court has thus rejected standing theories that \nrely “on a highly attenuated chain of possibilities” or that “require guess-\nwork as to how independent decisionmakers will exercise their judgment.”  \nClapper, 568 U.S. at 410, 413.   \nEven so, a “substantial risk” does not require that the threatened in-\n12 \n\nCase: 23-10362      Document: 543-1     Page: 13     Date Filed: 08/16/2023\nNo. 23-10362 \njury be “literally certain.”  Id. at 414 n.5; see Lujan, 504 U.S. at 564 n.2 (ac-\nknowledging that imminence “is concededly a somewhat elastic concept”); \nBabbitt v. United Farm Workers Nat’l Union, 442 U.S. 289, 298 (1979) (re-\nquiring that the plaintiff “demonstrate a realistic danger of sustaining a direct \ninjury”); Kolender v. Lawson, 461 U.S. 352, 355 n.3 (1983) (“a credible \nthreat”); Frame v. City of Arlington, 657 F.3d 215, 235 (5th Cir. 2011) (“a suf-\nficiently high degree of likelihood”).  Instead, a plaintiff seeking prospective \nrelief need only show that future injury is “fairly likely.”  Crawford v. Hinds \nCnty. Bd. of Supervisors, 1 F.4th 371, 376 (5th Cir. 2021); accord Arcia v. Fla. \nSec’y of State, 772 F.3d 1335, 1341 (11th Cir. 2014) (“a realistic probability”). \nIn assessing whether the threatened injury is fairly likely to occur, ev-\nidence of prior injury is especially probative.  See Crawford, 1 F.4th at 376 \n(citing Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95, 102 (1983)).  Said another way, it “is \nnot unduly conjectural” to use the “predictable effect” of the defendant’s \nprior actions as a method to predict what will happen in the future.  Apple Inc. \nv. Vidal, 63 F.4th 1, 17 (Fed. Cir. 2023) (quoting Dep’t of Com. v. New York, \n139 S. Ct. 2551, 2566 (2019)).  Injuries that are “one-off” instances or “epi-\nsodic” in nature do not move the needle much.  Crawford, 1 F.4th at 376.  But \nwhere the causes that produced the first injury remain in place, past-injury \nevidence bears strongly “on whether there is a real and immediate threat of \nrepeated injury.”  O’Shea v. Littleton, 414 U.S. 488, 496 (1974); see Crawford, \n1 F.4th at 376; accord In re Navy Chaplaincy, 697 F.3d 1171, 1176–77 (D.C. Cir. \n2012) (“The prospect of future injury becomes significantly less speculative \nwhere, as here, plaintiffs have identified concrete and consistently-imple-\nmented policies claimed to produce such injury.”). \nFinally, a group of plaintiffs need not show that more than one of them \nis likely to be injured.  “If at least one plaintiff has standing, the suit may \nproceed.”  Biden v. Nebraska, 143 S. Ct. 2355, 2365 (2023) (citing Rumsfeld \nv. F. for Acad. and Institutional Rts., Inc., 547 U.S. 47, 52 n.2 (2006)). \n13 \n\nCase: 23-10362      Document: 543-1     Page: 14     Date Filed: 08/16/2023\nNo. 23-10362 \nA. Associational Standing \n1. Factual Predicate \nThe Medical Organizations and Doctors chiefly rely on associational \nstanding.  That is, the organizations contend that they have standing because \ntheir members are likely to sustain injuries as a result of FDA’s actions.  See \nHunt v. Wash. State Apple Adv. Comm’n, 432 U.S. 333, 343 (1977).  We con-\nclude that the Medical Organizations and Doctors have made a “clear show-\ning” that their members face injury with sufficient likelihood to support en-\ntering a preliminary injunction.  Barber, 860 F.3d at 352. \nThe standing theory forwarded here rests on several basic premises, \nwhich are recited as follows.  Mifepristone causes adverse effects for a certain \npercentage of the women who take it.  Those adverse events are traceable to \nFDA because it approved the drug.  And hundreds of the Medical Organiza-\ntions’ members are OB/Gyns or emergency-room doctors who treat women \nwho experience severe adverse effects.  \nThe Doctors are allegedly injured when they treat mifepristone pa-\ntients.  They offer four reasons why that is so.  First, when a doctor treats a \nwoman suffering from a mifepristone complication, he or she will often be \nrequired to perform or complete an abortion.  And even if not, the doctor \nmust participate in the medical treatment that facilitates an abortion.  The \nDoctors allege that being made to provide this treatment conflicts with their \nsincerely held moral beliefs and violates their rights of conscience. \nSecond, treating mifepristone patients imposes mental and emotional \nstrain above what is ordinarily experienced in an emergency-room setting.  \nThird, providing emergency treatment forces the Doctors to divert time and \nresources away from their ordinary patients, hampering their normal prac-\ntice.  And fourth, the Doctors allege that mifepristone patients involve more \nrisk of complication than the average patient, and so expose the Doctors to \n14 \n\nCase: 23-10362      Document: 543-1     Page: 15     Date Filed: 08/16/2023\nNo. 23-10362 \nheightened risk of liability and increased insurance costs. \nThe Organizations reason that, given the millions of women who take \nmifepristone, the number of women who experience complications from tak-\ning the drug, and the high number of the Organizations’ members who treat \nsuch women, their members are likely to continue to treat women suffering \ncomplications as a result of mifepristone.  For the reasons listed above, \nproviding that treatment will injure the Doctors.  Thus, the Medical Organi-\nzations (via their members) are likely to be injured by FDA’s actions.  We \nfirst examine the evidence supporting those contentions. \na. Adverse Effects \nFDA and Danco do not dispute that a significant percentage of women \nwho take mifepristone experience adverse effects.  From Mifeprex’s initial \napproval to subsequent amendments to the REMS, FDA has acknowledged \nthat a certain fraction of patients would require surgery due to miscellaneous \ncomplications.  Approval Memorandum at 1; see also 2011 Mifepristone \nREMS at 5 (“[A]bout 5-8 out of 100 women taking Mifeprex will need a sur-\ngical procedure to end the pregnancy or to stop too much bleeding.”).  Sim-\nilarly, as explained by the motions panel, the required patient agreement dis-\ncloses that “the treatment will not work” in “about 2 to 7 out of 100 women” \nwho use mifepristone.  All. for Hippocratic Med., 2023 WL 2913725, at * 5.   \nTo be sure, not every woman who experiences complications will pre-\nsent to the emergency room or require surgery and/or some other form of \nurgent care.  But many will.  According to the most updated REMS medica-\ntion guide, in studies conducted in the United States, between 2.9% and 4.6% \nof women visited the emergency room after taking mifepristone.  Mifeprex \nPrescribing Information at 8 tbl.2 (Jan. 2023).  Some women experience es-\npecially severe conditions, such as sepsis (.02%) or hospitalization relating to \nabortion (.04% to .06%), and some women require a blood transfusion because \n15 \n\nCase: 23-10362      Document: 543-1     Page: 16     Date Filed: 08/16/2023\nNo. 23-10362 \nof heavy bleeding (.03% to .05%).  Id.2 \nThe data FDA cited in its 2000 approval memo is similar.  For the \nAmerican clinical trial, surgical intervention was required for 7.9% of women \n(4.5% for the French studies).  Approval Memorandum at 1.  Of that percent-\nage, 1.2% of women required surgery due to heavy bleeding (.3% for France) \nand .12% required a blood transfusion (.11% for France).  Id.  FDA and Danco \nagree that over five million women have taken Mifeprex since it was first ap-\nproved.  These figures show that thousands of women, and as many as hun-\ndreds of thousands, have experienced serious adverse effects as a result of \ntaking the drug, and required surgery or emergency care to treat those effects. \nThe Medical Organizations contend that their members treat women \nwho suffer serious complications after taking mifepristone.  These doctors \nsubmitted declarations testifying to their experience giving this sort of emer-\ngency care.  For example, Dr. Christina Francis recounted an instance where \na  patient  took  mifepristone  at  approximately  ten  weeks  gestation.    The \nwoman experienced serious complications and the doctor was forced to per-\nform a surgical abortion because the drug failed to terminate the pregnancy: \n[T]he patient presented back at our emergency room with \nheavy vaginal bleeding and unstable vital signs as a result of tak-\ning chemical abortion drugs.  One of my partners was able to \ndetect a fetal heartbeat.  Due to the amount of bleeding that she \nwas experiencing and evidence of hemodynamic instability, \nhowever, my partner had no choice but to perform an emer-\n_____________________ \n2 To be clear, we do not understand the Medical Organizations and Doctors’ stand-\ning theory as applying only to women who present to the emergency room with severe com-\nplications such as those listed above.  Rather, they also contend that they are injured by \ntreating women who experience less urgent medical side-effects because such treatment \nforces the doctor to participate in the abortion process. \n16 \n\nCase: 23-10362      Document: 543-1     Page: 17     Date Filed: 08/16/2023\nNo. 23-10362 \ngency D&C.  The patient needed to be hospitalized overnight \nfor close observation after the D&C. \nNot only did my partner need to provide several hours of criti-\ncal care for this patient, but my partner also needed to call in a \nback-up physician to care for another critically ill patient.  And \nbecause the preborn baby still had a heartbeat when the patient \npresented, my partner felt as though she was forced to partici-\npate in something that she did not want to be a part of—com-\npleting the abortion. \nDr. Francis Declaration ¶ 13.  Dr. Francis also testified to another example \nwhere a woman had developed an infection as a result of using mifepristone: \nAfter taking the chemical abortion drugs, [the patient] began \nhaving very heavy bleeding followed by significant abdominal \npain and a fever.  When I saw her in the emergency room, she \nhad evidence of retained pregnancy tissue along with endome-\ntritis, an infection of the uterine lining.  She also had acute kid-\nney injury, with elevated creatinine.  She required a dilation \nand curettage (D&C) surgery to finish evacuating her uterus of \nthe remaining pregnancy tissue and hospitalization for intrave-\nnous (IV) antibiotics, IV hydration, and a blood transfusion. \nId. ¶ 12.3  Dr. Ingrid Skop also testified to caring for many women experienc-\ning severe complications due to mifepristone: \nIn my practice, I have cared for at least a dozen women who \nhave required surgery to remove retained pregnancy tissue af-\nter a chemical abortion.  Sometimes this includes the embryo \nor fetus, and sometimes it is placental tissue that has not been \n_____________________ \n3 At oral argument, Defendants discounted the relevance of this instance because \nthe patient obtained mifepristone from outside of the country.  Mifeprex is only marketed \nand distributed in the United States, so the incident almost certainly did not involve FDA-\napproved Mifeprex.  We agree that the evidence is not as probative as other examples—\ndiscussed below—that involve brand name mifepristone.  But the incident still supports \nthe proposition that mifepristone sometimes causes severe adverse events. \n17 \n\nCase: 23-10362      Document: 543-1     Page: 18     Date Filed: 08/16/2023\nNo. 23-10362 \ncompletely  expelled.    I  have  cared  for  approximately  five \nwomen who, after a chemical abortion, have required admis-\nsion for a blood transfusion or intravenous antibiotics or both. \nFor  example,  in  one  month  while  covering  the  emergency \nroom, my group practice admitted three women to the hospital.  \nOf the three women admitted in one month due to chemical \nabortion complications, one required admission to the inten-\nsive care unit for sepsis and intravenous antibiotics, one re-\nquired a blood transfusion for hemorrhage, and one required \nsurgical completion for the retained products of conception \n(i.e., the doctors had to surgically finish the abortion with a suc-\ntion aspiration procedure). \nDr. Skop Declaration ¶¶ 17–18, 22.  She also described one occurrence where \na woman’s mifepristone prescriber did not offer surgical care in response to \nheavy bleeding.  That, in turn, required Dr. Skop to perform the follow-up \nsurgical procedure: \nIn my office, I treated one young woman who had been bleeding \nfor six weeks after she took the chemical abortion drugs given \nto her by a doctor at a Planned Parenthood clinic.  After two \nfollow-ups at Planned Parenthood, during which she was given \nadditional misoprostol but not offered surgical completion, she \npresented to me for help.  I performed a sonogram, identified a \nsignificant amount of pregnancy tissue remaining in her uterus, \nand performed a suction aspiration procedure to resolve her \ncomplication. \nId. ¶ 23.  Dr. Nancy Wozniak also described a serious complication in detail, \nin which the patient was at risk of bleeding to death:   \nOne of my patients, who was about nine weeks pregnant, had \npreviously been treated by hospital staff for a pulmonary embo-\nlism with anti-coagulants.  She was advised that she could not \nseek a chemical abortion because it was contraindicated due to \nthe medications; yet the woman left the hospital and sought an \nabortion at Planned Parenthood of Indiana.   \n18 \n\nCase: 23-10362      Document: 543-1     Page: 19     Date Filed: 08/16/2023\nNo. 23-10362 \nThe woman was given mifepristone by the doctor at Planned \nParenthood and took the drug.  The woman called an Uber for \na ride home from Planned Parenthood.  The woman began to \nexperience bleeding and other adverse side effects from the \nmifepristone.  The woman’s Uber driver did not take her home \nbecause she was so ill and instead brought her to the hospital’s \nemergency department. \nAt the hospital, the woman came under my care.  The woman \nhad not yet taken the second abortion drug, misoprostol.  I \ntreated the patient for the adverse effects she suffered and told \nher  not  to  take  the  misoprostol  given  to  her  by  Planned \nParenthood because of the grave risk that she could bleed out \nand die.  The woman had a subsequent ultrasound, which \nshowed that her unborn child was still alive.  I advised the in-\nternists  treating  this  patient  to  avoid  administering  certain \nmedications that could harm the patient and her unborn child. \nDr. Wozniak Declaration ¶ 24.  The risk of complications, the Medical Or-\nganizations say, is only heightened in the case of ectopic pregnancy.  Dr. Skop \ntestified about the dangers of taking mifepristone under that condition: \n[A]pproximately 2% of pregnancies are ectopic pregnancies, \nimplanted outside of the uterine cavity.  Chemical abortion \ndrugs will not effectually end an ectopic pregnancy because \nthey exert their effects on the uterus, which leaves women at \nrisk of severe harm from hemorrhage due to tubal rupture, in \nneed of emergent surgery or potentially at risk of death.  Failure \nto perform an ultrasound prior to prescribing abortion drugs \nwill cause some women to remain undiagnosed and at high risk \nfor these adverse outcomes. \nDr. Skop Declaration ¶ 29; see also Dr. Barrows Declaration ¶ 18. \nAccording to the Medical Organizations and Doctors, these are exam-\nples of medical cases that occur across the county.  The occurrences extend \nnot just to the declarants, they say, but to all of the Organizations’ members \n19 \n\nCase: 23-10362      Document: 543-1     Page: 20     Date Filed: 08/16/2023\nNo. 23-10362 \nwho are doctors.  The Organizations offered testimony from representatives \nof the American College of Pediatricians, American Association of Pro-Life \nObstetricians and Gynecologists, Christian Medical and Dental Associations, \nand Catholic Medical Association—each of whom explained that their mem-\nbership includes thousands of doctors and hundreds of OB/Gyns and emer-\ngency-room doctors.  See Dickerson Declaration ¶¶ 3, 13; Dr. Harrison Dec-\nlaration ¶ 8; Dr. Barrows Declaration ¶ 5; Dr. Van Meter Declaration ¶ 8.  \nGiven the large number of women who experience serious medical complica-\ntions due to mifepristone, and the large number of association members who \nare emergency-room doctors, the Medical Organizations argue, it is highly \nlikely that one or more of their members will be required to provide emer-\ngency care to a mifepristone patient in the near future. \nb. Doctors’ Injuries \nThe Medical Organizations and Doctors present evidence of four \nways they are injured by providing emergency care to women who used mif-\nepristone.  First, that treatment violates their conscience rights, putting them \nin a position where they must perform or complete an abortion even though \ndoing so is contrary to their moral beliefs.  As described by one doctor: \nThe FDA’s expansion of chemical abortion . . . harms my con-\nscience rights because it could force me to have to surgically \nfinish an incomplete elective chemical abortion.  I object to \nabortion because it ends a human life.  My moral and ethical \nobligation to my patients is to promote human life and health.  \nBut the FDA’s actions may force me to end the life of a human \nbeing in the womb for no medical reason. \nDr. Skop Declaration ¶ 34.  And multiple doctors testified that others they \nknew have been required to complete a failed chemical abortion against their \nconsciences, or to provide related care.  Dr. Francis Declaration ¶ 13; cf. Dr. \nBarrows Declaration ¶ 26. \n20 \n\nCase: 23-10362      Document: 543-1     Page: 21     Date Filed: 08/16/2023\nNo. 23-10362 \nSecond, treating mifepristone patients imposes considerable mental \nand emotional stress on emergency-room doctors.  This is due to the unique \nnature of chemical abortions, which, according to the plaintiff-doctors, fre-\nquently cause “regret” or “trauma” for the patients and, by extension, the \nphysicians.  Alliance Br. at 18.  Dr. George Delgado testified that his work \nwith such patients is “some of the most emotionally taxing work I have done \nin my career.”  Dr. Delgado Declaration ¶ 14; see also Dickerson Declaration \n¶ 14; Dr. Skop Declaration ¶ 33; Dr. Wozniak Declaration ¶ 17. \nThird, the Doctors are injured because they must divert time and re-\nsources away from their ordinary practice to treat mifepristone patients.  In \nparticular, the Doctors describe this treatment as often requiring extended \nphysician attention, blood for transfusions, and other hospital resources.  As \none doctor testified: \nWhen I must perform surgery [for] complications from chemi-\ncal abortions, this takes attention away from my other patients.  \nAs a hospitalist, I am often supervising multiple laboring pa-\ntients on labor and delivery.  When I am called to the operating \nroom to address an emergency resulting from chemical abor-\ntion, this necessarily means I may not be immediately available \nif an emergency should occur with one of my laboring patients. \nDr. Skop Declaration ¶ 32; see also Dr. Francis Declaration ¶ 12 (“I spent \nseveral hours with [my patient] the day of her surgery/hospital admission, \nkeeping me from my primary patient responsibilities in the labor and delivery \nunit and requiring me to call in an additional physician to help cover those \nresponsibilities.”); Dr. Harrison Declaration ¶ 30 (“Patients who suffer \ncomplications from chemical abortions require significantly more time and \nattention from providers than the typical OB/Gyn patient requires.”). This \ndiversion of resources, the Doctors say, directly harms their medical prac-\ntices. See Dr. Harrison Declaration ¶¶ 27–30. \n21 \n\nCase: 23-10362      Document: 543-1     Page: 22     Date Filed: 08/16/2023\nNo. 23-10362 \nFourth, such patients involve more risk than the average emergency-\nroom patient, which exposes the Doctors to greater malpractice liability and \nincreased insurance costs.  See Dr. Barrows Declaration ¶ 23 (testifying that \nproviding emergency treatment to women suffering complications because of \ntaking mifepristone puts doctors in “riskier, emergent medical situations”); \nDr. Jester Declaration ¶ 20 (“These situations are naturally higher risk for \nboth the patient and for the physician providing care.”).  The more mifepris-\ntone patients the Doctors treat, the higher their liability and greater their in-\njury.  See Dr. Barrows Declaration ¶¶ 21–24; Dr. Jester Declaration ¶¶ 20–\n21; Dr. Johnson Declaration ¶ 15.  Having examined the factual basis for the \nMedical Organizations and Doctors’ claims, we now answer the question of \nwhether they have associational standing to assert those claims. \n2. Analysis \na. Imminent Injury \nWe conclude that the Medical Organizations and Doctors have made \na “clear showing” of associational standing.  Barber, 860 F.3d at 352.  To \nbegin, it is “fairly likely” that the Doctors—both those who testified and \nthose who are members of the Medical Organizations but did not testify—\nwill continue treating women who experience severe complications after tak-\ning mifepristone.  Crawford, 1 F.4th at 376.  FDA’s own data shows that a \ndefinite percentage of women who take mifepristone will require emergency-\nroom care, be it a blood transfusion, a surgery to complete a failed abortion \nor ongoing pregnancy, or some other complication.  The data further shows \nthat millions of women take mifepristone.  And the Medical Organizations \ntestified that hundreds of their members are OB/Gyns and emergency-room \ndoctors who care for women in these circumstances.  The Medical Organiza-\ntions and Doctors therefore face a “substantial risk” of future injury.  Susan \nB. Anthony List, 573 U.S. at 158. \n22 \n\nCase: 23-10362      Document: 543-1     Page: 23     Date Filed: 08/16/2023\nNo. 23-10362 \nThat risk is supported by the fact that many Doctors have already been \nrequired to treat patients experiencing complications due to mifepristone.  \nLyons, 461 U.S. at 102.  These are not merely “one-off” instances.  Crawford, \n1 F.4th at 376.  On the contrary, FDA’s data and the Doctors’ testimony \nshow that women will continue to present to the emergency room after taking \nmifepristone, requiring urgent treatment.  That trend is not speculative—it \nis “predictable” and “consistent[].”  Vidal, 63 F.4th at 17; In re Navy Chap-\nlaincy, 697 F.3d at 1176.  And it does not matter that the foundation of the \nDoctors’ standing rests, in part, on “choices made by independent actors.”  \nLujan, 504 U.S. at 562.  That concern is alleviated where, as here, “third \nparties will likely act in predictable ways.”  Dep’t of Com., 139 S. Ct. at 2566. \nIt is worth repeating that the Medical Organizations and Doctors are \nnot required to show that it is “literally certain” that they will be injured.  \nClapper, 568 U.S. at 414 n.5.  They need only show a “substantial risk” that \ninjury will occur.  Susan B. Anthony List, 573 U.S. at 158; see also United Farm \nWorkers, 442 U.S. at 298 (“a realistic danger”); Kolender, 461 U.S. at 356 n.3 \n(“a credible threat”); Arcia, 772 F.3d at 1341 (“a realistic probability”).  At \nthis preliminary-injunction stage, they have carried their burden.  All. for Hip-\npocratic Med., 2023 WL 2913725, at *8. \nFDA and Danco’s primary objection to the Medical Organizations \nand Doctors’ standing theory is that it is speculative and inconsistent with \nthe Supreme Court’s decision in Summers v. Earth Island Institute, 555 U.S. \n488 (2009).  We disagree.  For one thing, testimony was offered from multi-\nple doctors who have personally given emergency care to women suffering \ncomplications from mifepristone.  Dr. Francis Declaration ¶¶ 12–13; Dr. \nSkop Declaration ¶¶ 17–18, 22; Dr. Jester ¶ 17.  Given those prior instances, \nand given mifepristone’s continued availability, the Medical Organizations \nreason that these members are reasonably likely to be injured again.  The rec-\nord amply supports that claim. \n23 \n\nCase: 23-10362      Document: 543-1     Page: 24     Date Filed: 08/16/2023\nNo. 23-10362 \nMoreover, it is not speculative to base standing on the likelihood that \nsome members of a discrete group, but not all, will be injured.  To be sure, \nthe record must be specific enough to establish that a group of members who \nclaim future injury are really at risk.  But the evidence before us meets that \nstandard.  The Medical Organizations and Doctors have proven up each link \nin the chain of causation—that a percentage of women who take mifepristone \nwill suffer serious medical complications; that hundreds of the Medical Or-\nganizations’ members are physicians who treat patients in those circum-\nstances; that many of the Doctors have in fact treated such patients; and that \nproviding such treatment causes the Doctors to violate their rights of con-\nscience, sustain mental and emotional distress, divert time and resources \naway from their ordinary practice, and incur additional liability and insurance \ncosts.  Contrary to what FDA and Danco argue, the conclusion the Doctors \ndraw from that data is not speculative. \nAnd the Medical Organizations’ standing argument does not conflict \nwith Summers.  The problem in that case was not that plaintiffs’ standing the-\nory was invalid.  It was that the organizational plaintiffs failed to prove that \ntheir members would be injured. \nSummers concerned parks administered by the federal Forest Service.  \nThe Forest Service issued a regulation allowing it to sell burned timber and \nconduct fire-remediation activities on certain low-acreage lots without the \nordinary notice and comment procedures.  Various environmental organiza-\ntions sued on behalf of their members, asserting recreational injury based on \ntheir members’ professed intent to visit one of the hundreds of parks that \nmight be affected by the new Service regulation. 555 U.S. at 490–92.  Their \nprimary evidence was an affidavit executed by one member who had visited \na park already subject to fire-remediation activities, and who intended to visit \nthe park again.  The Service conceded that this plaintiff had standing, but the \nparties settled the dispute as to the particular park, and so it was “not at is-\n24 \n\nCase: 23-10362      Document: 543-1     Page: 25     Date Filed: 08/16/2023\nNo. 23-10362 \nsue” once the case was before the Supreme Court.  Id. at 491  (quoting Earth \nIsland Inst. v. Pengilly, 376 F. Supp. 2d 994, 999 (E.D. Cal. 2005)).  \nThe plaintiffs attempted to continue their challenge to the regulation, \nasserting that their other members were statistically likely to travel to one of \nthe many parks that would likely be affected by the regulation.  To be sure, \nthe majority expressed skepticism with that theory.  See id. at 497 (criticizing \nthe dissent’s “hitherto unheard-of test for organizational standing: whether \n. . . there is a statistical probability that some of [the plaintiffs’] members are \nthreatened with concrete injury”).  But its bigger concern was that plaintiffs \nfailed to prove their claims: they lacked evidence of the number of association \nmembers who intended to visit the parks, and when: \nA major problem with the dissent’s approach is that it accepts \nthe organizations’ self-descriptions of their membership, on \nthe simple ground that “no one denies” them.  But it is well \nestablished that the court has an independent obligation to as-\nsure that standing exists, regardless of whether it is challenged \nby any of the parties. \nId. at 499.  A primary reason for the lack of evidence was the majority’s deci-\nsion to not consider several affidavits offered after the district court entered \njudgment—affidavits that would have made the required showing.  See id. at \n495 n.* (declining to consider the affidavits); cf. id. at 508–09 (Breyer, J., dis-\nsenting) (arguing that the Court should consider them).  Without those affi-\ndavits, the majority understood itself as not having evidence of any other \nmember’s injury: \nIn part because of the difficulty of verifying the facts upon \nwhich such probabilistic standing depends, the Court has re-\nquired plaintiffs claiming an organizational standing to identify \nmembers who have suffered the requisite harm—surely not a \ndifficult task here, when so many thousands are alleged to have \nbeen harmed. \n25 \n\nCase: 23-10362      Document: 543-1     Page: 26     Date Filed: 08/16/2023\nNo. 23-10362 \nId. at 499.  This understanding of Summers is reinforced by the Court’s recent \ndecision in Department of Education v. Brown, 143 S. Ct. 2343 (2023).  There, \nthe Court reiterated its view that no plaintiff had shown that he or she actively \nplanned to visit the sites at issue.  See id. at 2354 n.3 (“[N]o plaintiff in Sum-\nmers had standing because none had alleged specific plans to observe nature \nin one of the areas at issue . . . .”). \nSummers does not stand for the proposition that courts must categor-\nically reject standing when a plaintiff alleges that a defendant’s action puts \nhundreds of association members at risk of future injury.  It stands for the \nproposition that courts must treat such assertions with caution.  The stand-\nard for making this showing is high, but the Medical Organizations and Doc-\ntors have met it.  They have provided multiple examples of organization \nmembers who sustained the exact harm they say will recur.  They have ex-\nplained that the conditions producing that harm remain in place.  And they \nhave testified to having hundreds of members who are reasonably likely to be \nharmed.  At this stage, that is enough. \nb. Cognizable Injury \nIn addition to being sufficiently imminent, threatened injuries must \nalso be legally cognizable.  TransUnion LLC v. Ramirez, 141 S. Ct. 2190, \n2204–07 (2021); Lujan, 504 U.S. at 562.  The injuries here are.  To begin, \neconomic harm—like damage to one’s business interest—is a quintessential \nArticle III injury.  TransUnion, 142 S. Ct. at 2204; see, e.g., Greater Phila. \nChamber of Com. v. City of Philadelphia, 949 F.3d 116, 131 (3d Cir. 2020) (rec-\nognizing that businesses had standing to challenge local ordinance, which \nwould hamper hiring and salary decisions).  The Doctors therefore sustain a \nconcrete injury when they are forced to divert time and resources away from \ntheir regular patients.  Dr. Skop Declaration ¶ 32; Dr. Francis Declaration \n¶ 12;  Dr. Harrison Declaration ¶¶ 27–30; see also All. for Hippocratic Med., \n26 \n\nCase: 23-10362      Document: 543-1     Page: 27     Date Filed: 08/16/2023\nNo. 23-10362 \n2023 WL 2913725, at *6–7.  And by the same token, the Doctors sustain a \nconcrete injury when mifepristone patients expose them to greater liability \nand increased insurance costs.  Dr. Barrows Declaration ¶¶ 21–24; Dr. Jester \nDeclaration ¶¶ 20–21; Dr. Johnson Declaration ¶ 15. \nThe Medical Organizations and Doctors also face a concrete injury \nwhen they are forced to choose between following their conscience and \nproviding care to a woman experiencing complications as a result of taking \nmifepristone.  As recounted above, evidence was offered of a doctor who per-\nsonally gave care in these circumstances.  Dr. Skop Declaration ¶ 17 (“In my \npractice, I have cared for at least a dozen women who have required surgery \nto remove retained pregnancy tissue after a chemical abortion.  Sometimes \nthis includes the embryo or fetus, and sometimes it is placental tissue that has \nnot been completely expelled.”).  Another doctor testified about her partner, \nwho experienced the same thing.  Dr. Francis Declaration ¶ 13 (“Due to the \namount of bleeding . . . my partner had no choice but to perform an emer-\ngency D&C. . . . And because the preborn baby still had a heartbeat when the \npatient presented, my partner felt as though she was forced to participate in \nsomething that she did not want to be a part of—completing the abortion.”).  \nAnd other doctors testified of fear that they or fellow physicians will be forced \ninto similar situations.  Dr. Barrows Declaration ¶ 26; Dr. Skop Declaration \n¶ 34; cf. Dickerson Declaration ¶ 16. \nFDA and Danco do not dispute that the Medical Organizations and \nDoctors’ conscience injury is cognizable.  But they defend FDA’s actions on \nthe ground that federal law would allow the Doctors to refuse care based on \na conscientious objection.  FDA Br. at 26; Danco Br. at 21 (citing 42 U.S.C. \n§§ 238n, 300a-7(c), (d)).  The Medical Organizations and Doctors respond \nby pointing out that the federal government has recently taken a contrary po-\nsition.  That is, in July 2022, the Department of Health and Human Services \nissued a guidance document that interprets the Emergency Medical Treat-\n27 \n\nCase: 23-10362      Document: 543-1     Page: 28     Date Filed: 08/16/2023\nNo. 23-10362 \nment and Active Labor Act to require hospitals to provide care to, among \nothers, a woman with an “incomplete medical abortion,” irrespective of ob-\njections of conscience.  Reinforcement of EMTALA Obligations Specific to \nPatients Who Are Pregnant or Are Experiencing Pregnancy Loss, at 6, Cen-\nters for Medicare & Medicaid Services (July 11, 2022).  A district court has \nenjoined that guidance, and an appeal is proceeding before this court.  Texas \nv. Becerra, 623 F. Supp. 3d 696 (N.D. Tex. 2022) (entering preliminary in-\njunction); Texas v. Becerra, No. 5:22-CV-185, 2023 WL 2467217 (N.D. Tex. \nJan. 10, 2023) (final judgment and permanent injunction). \nAt oral argument, counsel for FDA disputed that EMTALA binds in-\ndividual doctors, arguing instead that the obligation to provide abortion-re-\nlated care runs to hospitals.  That is, individual doctors may assert conscience \nobjections so long as one doctor at the hospital can provide the required care.  \nThis raises the question of what would happen if no other doctor were avail-\nable—a situation that seems particularly likely in smaller clinics.  But setting \nthat issue to the side, counsel’s argument appears to conflict with the Gov-\nernment’s position on appeal in the Texas case.  See Br. for Appellants at 25, \nTexas v. Becerra (5th Cir. May 1, 2023) (No. 23-10246) (“EMTALA requires \ndoctors to offer abortion care when that care is the necessary stabilizing treat-\nment for an emergency medical condition.”) (emphasis added); id. at 27 \n(“[W]hen pregnant women come to a Medicare-funded hospital with an \nemergency medical condition, EMTALA obligates the treating physician to \nprovide stabilizing treatment, including abortion care.”) (quoting United \nStates v. Idaho, 623 F. Supp. 3d 1096, 1109 (D. Idaho 2022)). \nWe conclude that the federal laws Defendants cite do not alleviate the \nDoctors’ conscience injury, at least for purposes of this preliminary posture.  \nThe inconsistencies between the Government’s position in Texas v. Becerra \nand FDA’s position here tend to rebut the notion that Doctors are free to \nrefuse treatment to mifepristone patients. \n28 \n\nCase: 23-10362      Document: 543-1     Page: 29     Date Filed: 08/16/2023\nNo. 23-10362 \nWe next address the Doctors’ argument that they will suffer an inde-\npendent injury by way of the “enormous stress and pressure” that is involved \nwith treating women suffering complications from taking mifepristone.  Dr. \nWozniak Declaration ¶ 17.  They maintain that FDA’s actions cause women \nto present at the emergency room with complications that involve a unique \nlevel of trauma and distress, due to the high amount of emotional and physical \nstrain often associated with the experience.  Dr. Delgado Declaration ¶ 14; \nDickerson Declaration ¶ 14; Dr. Skop Declaration ¶ 33. \nIt is true that the Supreme Court has interpreted Article III to recog-\nnize injuries that “significantly affect[]” a plaintiff’s “quality of life.”  Sierra \nClub v. Morton, 405 U.S. 727, 734–35 (1972).  And several of our sister circuits \nacknowledge standing that is predicated on “emotional or psychological \nharm.”  Maddox v. Bank of N.Y. Mellon Tr. Co., 19 F.4th 58, 65 (2d Cir. 2021) \n(quoting TransUnion, 141 S. Ct. at 2211 n.7); see also Clemens v. ExecuPharm \nInc., 48 F.4th 146, 155 (3d Cir. 2022) (same).  However, the mental and emo-\ntional stress shown here is best understood as additional to the Doctors’ con-\nscience injuries, not independent from them.  The threat of being forced to \nviolate a sincerely held moral belief is cognizable at least in part because the \nevent would involve acute emotional and psychological harm.  Maddox, 19 \nF.4th at 65; Clemens, 48 F.4th at 155.  The emotional and mental strain of \nwhich the Doctors testify is of the same nature, albeit of an arguably lesser \nmagnitude.  In this way, the “enormous stress and pressure” that the Medi-\ncal Organizations and Doctors cite augment the Doctors’ conscience injuries, \nbut does not provide a separate basis for Article III standing.4 \nDanco argues that the Medical Organizations and Doctors’ standing \n_____________________ \n4 We understand the Doctors’ conscience injuries as being supported by longstand-\ning precedent of the Supreme Court and this court.  We thus do not discuss our colleague’s \nthoughtful comments on other types of injuries that may be cognizable.  Post at 67–70. \n29 \n\nCase: 23-10362      Document: 543-1     Page: 30     Date Filed: 08/16/2023\nNo. 23-10362 \nargument is “limitless,” and worries that its logic would allow doctors to \nchallenge firearm laws based on the stress involved with treating gunshot vic-\ntims.  Danco Br. at 22–23 (citing E.T. v. Paxton, 41 F.4th 709, 721 (5th Cir. \n2022)).  But we see several limits.  Foremost is the rigorous evidence needed \nto prove traceability and redressability.  The plaintiffs in Danco’s hypothet-\nical would lack standing unless they could prove that a particular law caused \nthere to be more gunshot victims, and that enjoining enforcement of the law \nwould cause there to be fewer.  That is a tall order, to say the least.  Equally \nsignificant is the requirement that a plaintiff be threatened with injury akin to \nbeing forced to violate his or her sincerely held conscience beliefs.  That sort \nof injury will be absent except in the most exceptional cases.  We do not think \nthat our holding will open the floodgates to the litigation Danco describes. \nc. Traceability \nStanding to challenge mifepristone’s approval does not necessarily in-\nclude standing to challenge FDA’s subsequent actions.  That is so because \n“standing is not dispensed in gross; rather, plaintiffs must demonstrate \nstanding for each claim that they press and for each form of relief that they \nseek.”  TransUnion, 141 S. Ct. at 2208.  As we have said many times, standing \nproceeds claim by claim.  E.g., In re Gee, 941 F.3d 153, 170–71 (5th Cir. 2019); \nFriends of St. Frances Xavier v. FEMA, 658 F.3d 460, 466 (5th Cir. 2011).  The \nMedical Organizations and Doctors are correct, then, to acknowledge that \nthey must show “harms to the plaintiff doctors and associations [that] flow \nfrom each of the relevant FDA actions.”  Alliance Br. at 22. \ni. 2016 Amendments  \nThe  Medical  Organizations  and  Doctors  contend  that  the  2016 \nAmendments will increase the number of women who suffer complications \nas a result of taking mifepristone.  That is so for three reasons, they say.  First, \nthe risk of complication increases with gestational age, and the Amendments \n30 \n\nCase: 23-10362      Document: 543-1     Page: 31     Date Filed: 08/16/2023\nNo. 23-10362 \nincrease the maximum permissible age from forty-nine days to seventy days.  \nSee Dr. Skop Declaration ¶ 28 (asserting that taking mifepristone at later \nstages of gestation increases the chance of “complications due to the in-\ncreased amount of tissue, leading to hemorrhage, infection and/or the need \nfor surgeries or other emergency care”); see also Dr. Barrows Declaration \n¶ 22; Dr. Wozniak Declaration ¶ 10. \nSecond, the percentage of women who experience complications that \npresent to the emergency room (as opposed to their mifepristone provider) \nwill increase because the Amendments remove the requirement for a second \nand third in-person visit.  One doctor explained this phenomenon: \nUnder the current practice by those who prescribe and dis-\npense  chemical  abortion  drugs  like  mifepristone  and  miso-\nprostol, there is no follow-up or additional care provided to pa-\ntients.  Instead, with no established relationship with a physi-\ncian, patients are simply left to report to the emergency room \nwhen they experience adverse events.  \nDr. Foley Declaration ¶ 11; see also Dr. Harrison Declaration ¶ 44 (testifying \nthat eliminating in-person evaluations and follow-up care “places our mem-\nber doctors at increased risk of being forced to violate their conscience \nrights”); Dr. Frost-Clark Declaration ¶ 21 (similar).  \nThird, and relatedly, the percentage of women who present to the \nemergency room will increase because the Amendments allow non-physi-\ncians to prescribe mifepristone.  As the motions panel explained, women who \nreceive the drug from someone other than a doctor “cannot possibly go back \nto their non-doctor-prescribers for surgical abortions.”  All. for Hippocratic \nMed., 2023 WL 2913725, at *5.  And multiple doctors testified that they have \nseen or expect to see more women with serious complications resulting from \nmifepristone. Dr. Harrison Declaration ¶ 26; Dr. Skop Declaration ¶¶ 20–\n21; Dr. Wozniak Declaration ¶¶ 18, 29; Dr. Johnson Declaration ¶ 18; Dr. \n31 \n\nCase: 23-10362      Document: 543-1     Page: 32     Date Filed: 08/16/2023\nNo. 23-10362 \nFrost-Clark Declaration ¶ 18; Dr. Jester Declaration ¶ 13.  Given the already-\nsubstantial risk of harm, the evidence of increased risk is sufficient to confer \nstanding to challenge the 2016 Amendments.  See Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc. \nv. EPA, 464 F.3d 1, 6–7 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (holding that plaintiffs had standing \nbased on “increased risk” of developing skin cancer); Sutton v. St. Jude Med. \nS.C., Inc., 419 F.3d 568, 570–75 (6th Cir. 2005) (holding that plaintiffs had \nstanding based on an “increased risk” of harm from a medical device). \nii. 2021 Non-Enforcement Decision \nThe Medical Organizations and Doctors have also shown that the \n2021 Non-Enforcement Decision contributes to their injury.  That decision \neffectively removes the in-person dispensing requirement, allowing women \nto request and take mifepristone without ever going to the doctor’s office.  \nEvidence was introduced that this change will cause additional severe com-\nplications.  Among other things, several doctors testified that supervision is \nnecessary to ensure patients’ safety: \nThe FDA’s actions harm women, including my patients, be-\ncause clinics and physicians prescribing or dispensing chemical \nabortion drugs, or websites that provide these drugs through \nmail order delivery without any physician involvement, often \nunderprepare women for the severity and risks of chemical \nabortion, and they often provide insufficient or no follow-up \ncare to those women. \nDr. Skop Declaration ¶ 27; see also Dr. Harrison Declaration ¶ 25 (“Mifepris-\ntone and misoprostol are serious drugs that should not be administered with-\nout medical supervision.  The FDA’s actions to eliminate the necessary su-\npervision of these drugs harms women and obstetrics professionals . . . .”); \ncf. Dickerson Declaration ¶ 12 (“[Mifepristone] can now be administered and \ndispensed with no in-person examination or oversight by a physician.”). \nDoctors also testified that, without in-person examination, the pre-\n32 \n\nCase: 23-10362      Document: 543-1     Page: 33     Date Filed: 08/16/2023\nNo. 23-10362 \nscriber is less likely to accurately determine gestational age: \nMifepristone and misoprostol are dangerous drugs that can po-\ntentially harm women.  Relaxing the required medical supervi-\nsion and oversight for patients taking these drugs puts wom-\nen’s health at risk.   \nBy eliminating the in-person dispensing requirement and the \nrequirement for a post-abortion follow-up, the FDA has ex-\nposed women to a higher likelihood of undetected serious com-\nplications.  Specifically, the expanded use of telemedicine for \nchemical abortions means that some women who are beyond \n70 days’ gestation because they are mistaken or wrong about \nthe gestational age of their unborn child will take these drugs \noutside of the appropriate window. \nDr. Barrows Declaration ¶¶ 16–17; see also Dr. Skop Declaration ¶ 28 (“Un-\nsupervised chemical abortion . . . harms women because they may have un-\nderestimated the gestational age of their unborn child.”).  And the Doctors \nsay that the need for in-person supervision is even greater in cases of ectopic \npregnancy.  Dr. Skop Declaration ¶¶ 27, 29. \nFinally, many doctors offered testimony that, as a result of the 2021 \nNon-Enforcement Decision, more women will suffer serious adverse events.  \nDr. Wozniak Declaration ¶ 14 (“The increasing number of chemical abor-\ntions through mail-order or telemedicine methods means that more women \nwill suffer complications from unsupervised use of mifepristone and miso-\nprostol.”); Dr. Frost-Clark Declaration ¶ 12 (“The FDA’s suspension of the \nin-person dispensing requirement of mifepristone and misoprostol harms \nwomen and doctors because it  has  resulted  in  an  increase  in  complica-\ntions.”); see also Dr. Skop Declaration ¶¶ 20–21; Dr. Johnson Declaration \n¶ 18; Dr. Jester Declaration ¶ 13.  One doctor personally witnessed an in-\ncrease in complications after a district court temporarily enjoined the in-per-\nson dispensing requirement in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic.  Dr. \n33 \n\nCase: 23-10362      Document: 543-1     Page: 34     Date Filed: 08/16/2023\nNo. 23-10362 \nFrancis Declaration ¶ 11 (“The frequency of these complications has in-\ncreased since a federal district court first enjoined and set aside the FDA’s \nin-person dispensing requirement of mifepristone in 2020.”); see generally \nAm. Coll. of Obstetricians & Gynecologists v. FDA, 472 F. Supp. 3d 183 (D. Md. \n2020) (district court opinion enjoining the in-person requirements).5 \nBased on that evidence, the Medical Organizations and Doctors have \nmade a clear showing that the 2021 Non-Enforcement Decision causes an in-\ncreased risk of injury.  FDA and Danco resist this conclusion, arguing that \nany increase to the Medical Organizations and Doctors injury is speculative \nbecause the number of women who experience ectopic pregnancies is so \nsmall.  FDA Reply Br. at 24; Danco Reply Br. at 11–12.  But that understates \nthe bases of the alleged injury.  The Medical Organizations and Doctors argue \nthat ectopic pregnancy (and the possible failure to diagnose it) is one of the \nreasons why removing the in-person dispensing requirement will lead to \nmore complications—not the only reason.  As explained above, the declar-\nants offer several other grounds for their contention, including the need for \nin-person supervision when a patient takes mifepristone, the need to accu-\nrately assess gestational age, and the need for in-person follow-up.  We con-\nclude that the Medical Organizations and Doctors have shown a substantial \nrisk of injury due to the 2021 Non-Enforcement Decision.  As such, they have \nassociational standing to challenge this action. \n*  *  * \nBecause we hold that the Medical Organizations and Doctors have as-\nsociational standing, we need not consider whether they also have organiza-\n_____________________ \n5 FDA initially appealed that ruling, but the parties dismissed the appeal after FDA \nannounced that it would decline to enforce the in-person dispensing and prescription re-\nquirements.  See Am. Coll. of Obstetricians & Gynecologists v. Indiana, No. 20-1784, 2021 WL \n3276054 (4th Cir. May 19, 2021). \n34 \n\nCase: 23-10362      Document: 543-1     Page: 35     Date Filed: 08/16/2023\nNo. 23-10362 \ntional or third-party standing.  See generally ACORN v. Fowler, 178 F.3d 350, \n356–57 (5th Cir. 1999); see also All. for Hippocratic Med., 2023 WL 2913725, at \n*4 n.4.  However, to the extent that it were necessary to consider third-party \nstanding, it is likely that emergency-room doctors have a sufficiently “close \nrelationship” with mifepristone patients.  Kowalski v. Tesmer, 543 U.S. 125, \n130 (2004); cf. June Med. Servs. LLC v. Russo, 140 S. Ct. 2103, 2118–19 \n(2020), overruled on other grounds, Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Org., 142 \nS. Ct. 2228 (2022).  Indeed, the Court has “long permitted abortion provid-\ners to invoke the rights of their actual or potential patients.”  June Med. \nServs., 140 S. Ct. at 2118.  We fail to see how this case is materially different. \nFDA and Danco deny that third-party standing applies, saying that the \nDoctors have a “diametrically opposed” or “antagonistic” relationship with \nwomen experiencing severe complications as a result of taking mifepristone.  \nFDA Br. at 33; Danco Br. at 32.  That is so, Defendants contend, because the \nrelief the Doctors seek would reimpose certain conditions of using mifepris-\ntone.  That dubious proposition misunderstands the nature of the would-be \nrepresentation.  The Doctors pursue third-party standing to represent their \npatients’ interest in avoiding or limiting the dangerous side effects that some-\ntimes occur when a woman takes mifepristone.   \nAlthough we do not fulsomely consider the issue here, we suspect that \nthe Doctors—who have provided firsthand care to dozens of mifepristone \npatients experiencing acute physical and emotional distress in an emergency \nsetting—have a relationship with their patients that is more than adequate to \nsupport third-party standing.  In many respects, such a relationship may be \ncloser than those previously recognized by the Supreme Court.  June Med. \nServs., 140 S. Ct. at 2118–19; Whole Women’s Health v. Hellerstedt, 136 S. Ct. \n2292, 2314 (2016); Gonzales v. Carhart, 550 U.S. 124, 133 (2007).   \n35 \n\nCase: 23-10362      Document: 543-1     Page: 36     Date Filed: 08/16/2023\nNo. 23-10362 \nB. 2019 Generic Approval \nUnlike FDA’s other actions, the Medical Organizations and Doctors \ndid not introduce evidence showing that they are likely to be injured by the \n2019 Generic Approval.  They point to the 2000 Approval, arguing that the \ntwo actions impose the same injuries.  Alliance Br. at 23 n.4 (“The generic \ndrug comes with all the same harms as does the name brand—so the district \ncourt’s harm analysis applies fully to the 2019 ANDA approval.”).  That may \nbe true, but the Medical Organizations and Doctors cannot carry their burden \nof proof with legal argument.  There is nothing in the record tending to show \nthat the 2019 Generic Approval contributes to the risk of harm—no evidence \nthat the women the Doctors have treated took the generic version of mife-\npristone, and no evidence that the number of women experiencing medical \ncomplications after taking mifepristone has risen as a result of the generic.  \nIndeed, the preliminary-injunction exhibits do not mention generic \nmifepristone at all.  Separate from associational standing, there is no evidence \nthat the 2019 Generic Approval contributed to any organizational injury sus-\ntained by the Medical Organizations or any individual injury sustained by a \nthird-party patient.  In short, the Medical Organizations and Doctors did not \nprove that the 2019 Generic Approval affects their risk of future harm.  Ac-\ncordingly, we must vacate the component the district court’s order staying \nthe effective date of FDA’s approval of the generic version of mifepristone. \nThis holding means that generic mifepristone, like the brand version, \nwill remain available for use under the conditions provided by the relevant \nmifepristone REMS.  FDA amended that REMS in 2016 and 2021, but for \nthe reasons explained below, we affirm the portion of the district court’s or-\nder that stays the effective dates of those amendments.  And so pending trial \non the merits, the current REMS will be the version that was in effect prior \nto the 2016 Amendments.  Of course, the mifepristone REMS does not dis-\n36 \n\nCase: 23-10362      Document: 543-1     Page: 37     Date Filed: 08/16/2023\nNo. 23-10362 \ntinguish between branded and generic mifepristone.  FDA Br. at 9 (“The \nsame REMS covers both versions of mifepristone.”).  As such, the generic \nversion will be available under the same conditions as Mifeprex.  \nIII. Merits \nHaving concluded that the Medical Organizations and Doctors have \nstanding except as to the 2019 Generic Approval, we now turn to the merits \nof the district court’s stay order.  That inquiry involves the traditional four-\nfactor test for a preliminary injunction.  To merit relief, a movant must show: \n(1) a substantial likelihood of success on the merits, (2) a substantial threat of \nirreparable harm, (3) that the threat of injury outweighs any harm that an in-\njunction would cause, and (4) that the public interest is not disserved by an \ninjunction.  Garcia v. Jones, 910 F.3d 188, 190 (5th Cir. 2018). \nIn reviewing those factors, we review legal conclusions de novo and \nfindings of fact for clear error.  Jones v. Tex. Dep’t of Crim. Just., 880 F.3d \n756, 759 (5th Cir. 2018).  The parties agree that these preliminary-injunction \nfactors apply even though the district court entered a stay under 5 U.S.C. § \n705.  That is so because a stay has the practical effect of an injunction. 28 \nU.S.C. § 1292(a); see All. for Hippocratic Med., 2023 WL 2913725, at *3 n.3; \naccord Colorado v. EPA, 989 F.3d 874, 883 (10th Cir. 2021) (“These four fac-\ntors also determine when a court should grant a stay of agency action under \nsection 705 of the APA.”). \nThe first question is whether the Medical Organizations and Doctors \nhave shown a substantial likelihood of success on the merits.  At the outset, \nwe note that “substantial” does not mean “certain.”  Byrne v. Roemer, 847 \nF.2d 1130, 1133 (5th Cir. 1988) (explaining that “the movant need not always \nshow a probability of success on the merits”) (quoting Celestine v. Butler, 823 \nF.2d 74, 77 (5th Cir. 1987)); see Jefferson Cmty. Health Care Ctrs., Inc. v. Jef-\nferson Parish, 849 F.3d 615, 626 (5th Cir. 2017) (“Though there is no partic-\n37 \n\nCase: 23-10362      Document: 543-1     Page: 38     Date Filed: 08/16/2023\nNo. 23-10362 \nular degree of likelihood of success that is required in every case, the party \nseeking a preliminary injunction must establish at least some likelihood of \nsuccess on the merits before the court may proceed to assess the remaining \nrequirements.”).  A plaintiff need not prove “its entitlement to summary \njudgment in order to establish a substantial likelihood of success on the mer-\nits.”  Byrum v. Landreth, 566 F.3d 442, 446 (5th Cir. 2009) (internal quota-\ntion marks omitted).  But at a minimum, it must “present a substantial case \non the merits.”  Bryne, 847 F.2d at 1133(quoting Celestine, 823 F.2d at 77). \nA. 2000 Approval \nAs explained above, the Medical Organizations and Doctors have \nstanding to challenge the 2000 Approval, the 2016 Amendments, and the \n2021 Non-Enforcement Decision.  Before addressing the merits of the chal-\nlenge as to the 2000 Approval, we must consider a threshold issue: whether \nthat claim was timely asserted. \nThe Medical Organizations and Doctors admit that they did not raise \na claim as to FDA’s denial of their 2002 citizen petition within six years, as \nrequired for civil actions filed against the United States.  28 U.S.C. § 2401.  \nThey present two independent arguments for why their claim as to the 2000 \nApproval is nonetheless timely.  The motions panel rejected both arguments.  \nAll. for Hippocratic Med., 2023 WL 2913725, at *13–15.  We do the same. \n1. Reopening Doctrine \nFirst, the Medical Organizations and Doctors point to a judge-made \nexception to the statute of limitations called the “reopening doctrine.”  Es-\nsentially, this doctrine allows a plaintiff to challenge an agency action past the \nordinary timeline if the agency substantively reconsiders the original action \nin a subsequent decision.  See Nat’l Biodiesel Bd. v. EPA, 843 F.3d 1010, 1017 \n(D.C. Cir. 2016); Sierra Club v. EPA, 551 F.3d 1019, 1024 (D.C. Cir. 2008).  \nThe Medical Organizations and Doctors maintain that the 2016 Amend-\n38 \n\nCase: 23-10362      Document: 543-1     Page: 39     Date Filed: 08/16/2023\nNo. 23-10362 \nments and 2021 Petition Denial each trigger reopening.  We disagree.6 \na. 2016 Amendments \n  The Medical Organizations and Doctors point both to FDA’s denial \nof their 2002 citizen petition and to the agency’s approval of the amendments \nto mifepristone’s conditions for use.  They argue that, when FDA denied the \ncitizen petition, it denied their request to rescind approval of mifepristone.  \nAnd when FDA approved the 2016 Amendments, it altered the regime by \nwhich mifepristone is prescribed and used.  Taken together, they say, these \nactions show that FDA substantively reconsidered the 2000 Approval. \nTo begin, the 2016 petition denial does not inform the 2016 Amend-\nments.  They are plainly different in nature; the former reaffirms FDA’s con-\nclusion that the agency properly approved mifepristone for use in 2000 and \nthe latter considers relaxed conditions for the drug’s use.  The Medical Or-\nganizations and Doctors likely could have challenged the 2000 Approval if \nthey had timely filed suit in response to the petition denial.  But they did not.  \nThe argument that the two decisions must be considered in tandem is really \njust an end-run around the fact that the Medical Organizations and Doctors \nwere too late to challenge FDA’s denial of their citizen petition. \nAccordingly, we consider only whether the 2016 Amendments them-\nselves give rise to the reopening doctrine.  They do not.  Nothing in FDA’s \napproval of the amendments shows that it undertook a “serious, substantive \nreconsideration” of the 2000 Approval.  Texas v. Biden, 20 F.4th 928, 951–\n_____________________ \n6 The Supreme Court has cast some doubt on whether the reopening doctrine is a \nlegitimate exception to a statute of limitations.  See Biden v. Texas, 142 S. Ct. 2528, 2545 \nn.8 (2022) (“[T]his Court has never adopted [the reopening doctrine], and [it] appears to \nbe inapposite to the question of final agency action.”).  But the parties both assume that the \ndoctrine is good law in this circuit.  And in any event, we need not address that threshold \nquestion because we ultimately conclude that the doctrine does not apply here.  \n39 \n\nCase: 23-10362      Document: 543-1     Page: 40     Date Filed: 08/16/2023\nNo. 23-10362 \n52 (5th Cir. 2021), rev’d on other grounds, 142 S. Ct. 2528 (2022).  Actually, \nthe opposite is true.  FDA took the restrictions imposed in 2000 as a given, \nand considered only whether the REMS amendments were safe and effective.  \nAs explained by the motions panel: “FDA’s 2016 decision to relax many of \nthe REMS was issued in response to Danco’s supplemental application re-\nquesting as much.”  All. for Hippocratic Med., 2023 WL 2913725, at *13. \nThe  Medical  Organizations  and  Doctors  respond  that  the  2016 \nAmendments were so significant as to constitute a change to the “basic reg-\nulatory scheme,” Nat’l Biodiesel Bd., 843 F.3d at 1017, thereby constructively \nreopening the 2000 Approval.  It is certainly true that the amendments mean-\ningfully altered the conditions under which mifepristone is prescribed and \ntaken.  But a regulatory amendment, even a major one, is insufficient to sat-\nisfy the reopening doctrine.  Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc. v. EPA, 571 F.3d 1245, \n1265–66 (D.C. Cir. 2009); see also Nat’l Ass’n of Reversionary Prop. Owners v. \nSurface Transp. Bd., 158 F.3d 135, 144–46 (D.C. Cir. 1998); United Transp. \nUnion-Ill. Legis. Bd. v. Surface Transp. Bd., 132 F.3d 71, 76 (D.C. Cir. 1998) \n(Ginsburg, J.).  To meet this high bar and trigger the reopening doctrine, the \namendment must fundamentally alter the nature of the regulation such that \nit “could not have been reasonably anticipated.”  Env’t Def. v. EPA, 467 F.3d \n1329, 1334 (D.C. Cir. 2006). \nThe 2016 Amendments do not clear that bar.  They do not alter \nFDA’s basic assumption that mifepristone is safe and effective, subject to \ncertain conditions for use.  To be sure, the amendments put the public on \nnotice of a significant change in the degree of mifepristone’s availability and \nrestriction.  Disagreement with that decision would support challenging the \nnew amendments—and that is exactly what the Medical Organizations did.  \nBut as to mifepristone’s approval per se, the 2016 Amendments tell the public \nnothing they did not already know.  As before, FDA approved a drug that \nchemically induces abortion, with the knowledge that the drug causes medi-\n40 \n\nCase: 23-10362      Document: 543-1     Page: 41     Date Filed: 08/16/2023\nNo. 23-10362 \ncal complications in a definite percentage of women.  We cannot say that the \namendments “significantly alter[ed] the stakes of judicial review” so as to \nallow the Medical Organizations and Doctors to challenge the 2000 Approval \nsixteen years after the fact.  Sierra Club, 551 F.3d at 1025. \nb. 2019 Citizen Petition \nThe Medical Organizations and Doctors also contend that FDA reo-\npened the 2000 Approval when it denied their 2019 citizen petition.  They \nemphasize the agency’s use of the phrase “full review,” and argue that FDA \nactively questioned whether mifepristone was safe.   \nThe record does not bear out that claim.  To start, the citizen petition \ndid not actually ask FDA to reconsider its approval of mifepristone; it re-\nquested that FDA “restore” previous restrictions and “retain” others cur-\nrently in place.  2019 Citizen Petition at 1, 2.  So FDA had no reason to reeval-\nuate mifepristone from the ground up.  Turning to the denial itself, FDA did \nnot reexamine its prior approval.  It certainly described its action as “a full \nreview of the Mifepristone REMS Program,” 2021 Denial Letter at 6, but the \nletter’s context shows that the agency reviewed the conditions for use that \nthe citizen petition had put at issue—not mifepristone’s underlying approval. \nNor did FDA constructively reopen the 2000 Approval by adopting a \nsignificant amendment to the mifepristone REMS.  As with the 2016 Amend-\nments, removing the in-person dispensing requirement does not change the \nbasic concept of allowing women to use mifepristone.  Nat’l Biodiesel Bd., 843 \nF.3d at 1017.  Between an “incremental adjustment[]” to the 2000 Approval \nand a “substantive reconsideration” of it, the decision to allow remote pre-\nscription and dispensing of mifepristone looks more like the former.  Texas, \n20 F.4th at 953, 952 (citations omitted).  And so if the reopening doctrine is \na valid exception to the statute of limitations, and we are not sure that it is, \nthat doctrine does not apply here because neither the 2016 Amendments nor \n41 \n\nCase: 23-10362      Document: 543-1     Page: 42     Date Filed: 08/16/2023\nNo. 23-10362 \nthe 2021 Petition Denial reevaluated FDA’s decision in 2000 to approve mif-\nepristone.  The reopening doctrine therefore does not permit the Medical \nOrganizations and Doctors to challenge the 2000 Approval after the pre-\nscribed limitations period. \n2. Equitable Tolling \nThe Medical Organizations and Doctors also point to equitable tolling \nas a justification for considering the 2000 Approval claim even though it is \nuntimely.  But that is a very narrow exception.  See Jones v. Lumpkin, 22 F.4th \n486, 490 (5th Cir. 2022) (reiterating that equitable tolling “is warranted in \nonly ‘rare and exceptional circumstances’”) (quoting Davis v. Johnson, 158 \nF.3d 806, 811 (5th Cir. 1998)).  It applies only if the plaintiff satisfies two con-\nditions: “(1) that he has been pursuing his rights diligently, and (2) that some \nextraordinary circumstance stood in his way and prevented timely filing.”  \nMenominee Indian Tribe of Wis. v. United States, 577 U.S. 250, 255 (2016) (ci-\ntation omitted). \nSupposing that the Medical Organizations and Doctors could meet \nthe first condition, they cannot meet the second.  This court has stressed that \nequitable tolling does not apply if the party seeking its benefit could have \ncomplied with the relevant deadline.  Jones, 22 F.4th at 490 (“[A] peti-\ntioner’s failure to satisfy the statute of limitations must result from external \nfactors beyond his control; delays of the petitioner’s own making do not qual-\nify.”) (quoting In re Wilson, 442 F.3d 872, 875 (5th Cir. 2006)).  Here, the \nMedical Organizations and Doctors offer no reason why they could not have \nfiled their lawsuit within the six-year limitations period.  See All. for Hippo-\ncratic Med., 2023 WL 2913725, at *15 (explaining that FDA’s delay in ruling \non the 2002 Citizen Petition “had no impact on the length of the statute-of-\nlimitations period or plaintiffs’ capacity to challenge the 2016 Petition De-\nnial”).  Their failure to do so forecloses any possibility of relief. \n42 \n\nCase: 23-10362      Document: 543-1     Page: 43     Date Filed: 08/16/2023\nNo. 23-10362 \n*  *  * \nFor the reasons stated above, we conclude that the claim as to the \n2000 Approval is untimely.  Consequently, the Medical Organizations and \nDoctors are not likely to succeed on that claim.  And that means that we must \nvacate the component of the district court’s order that stays the 2000 Ap-\nproval.  Willey v. Harris Cnty. Dist. Att’y, 27 F.4th 1125, 1129 (5th Cir. 2022). \nB. 2016 Amendments \nIn addition to the 2000 Approval claim, which is not likely to succeed, \nthe Medical Organizations and Doctors challenge two other actions taken by \nFDA: the 2016 Amendments to the mifepristone REMS and the 2021 deci-\nsion to not enforce regulations requiring in-person prescription.  The parties \nagree that the claims as to the 2016 Amendments and the 2021 Non-Enforce-\nment decision are timely, so we proceed to the merits. \nThe Medical Organizations and Doctors ground their claims in the \nAdministrative Procedure Act.  That law requires federal courts to “hold un-\nlawful and set aside agency action, findings, and conclusions found to be ar-\nbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance \nwith the law.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).  The Supreme Court has explained that \nthe “arbitrary-and-capricious standard requires that agency action be reason-\nable and reasonably explained.”  FCC v. Prometheus Radio Project, 141 S. Ct. \n1150, 1158 (2021).  That standard of review is “deferential,” id., but “not \ntoothless.”  Sw. Elec. Power Co. v. EPA, 920 F.3d 999, 1013 (5th Cir. 2019). \nOn the contrary, our review is “searching and careful.”  Univ. of Texas \nM.D. Anderson Cancer Ctr. v. U.S. Dep’t of Health and Hum. Servs., 985 F.3d \n472, 475 (5th Cir. 2021) (quoting Marsh v. Or. Nat. Res. Council, 490 U.S. \n360, 378 (1989)).  Above all, an agency must “examine the relevant data and \narticulate a satisfactory explanation for its action including a ‘rational con-\nnection between the facts found and the choice made.’”  Motor Vehicle Mfrs. \n43 \n\nCase: 23-10362      Document: 543-1     Page: 44     Date Filed: 08/16/2023\nNo. 23-10362 \nAss’n v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983) (quoting Bur-\nlington Truck Lines v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  An agency \nviolates these rules where it “entirely fail[s] to consider an important aspect \nof the problem,” or offers “an explanation for its decision that runs counter \nto the evidence before the agency, or is so implausible that it could not be \nascribed to a difference in view or the product of agency expertise.”  Id.; see \nalso Michigan v. EPA, 576 U.S. 743, 752 (2015); Mexican Gulf Fishing Co. v. \nU.S. Dep’t of Com., 60 F.4th 956, 971 (5th Cir. 2023); Sw. Elec. Power Co., \n920 F.3d at 1018–19 (explaining that courts must set aside agency action \nwhere there are “shortcomings in the agency’s explanations”). \nWith those standards in mind, we first address the 2016 Amendments \nand hold that the Medical Organizations and Doctors are substantially likely \nto succeed on the merits of that claim.  Byrne, 847 F.3d at 1133.  That is so for \ntwo instances of the same defect: failing to consider an important aspect of \nthe problem.  Michigan, 576 U.S. at 752; State Farm, 463 U.S. at 43. \nFirst, FDA did not consider the cumulative effect of the 2016 Amend-\nments.  Those changes include: increasing the maximum gestational age from \nforty-nine days to seventy days; allowing non-physicians to prescribe mife-\npristone; removing the requirement that the administration of misoprostol \nand the subsequent follow-up appointment be conducted in person; eliminat-\ning prescribers’ obligation to report non-fatal adverse events; switching the \nmethod of administration for misoprostol from oral to buccal; and changing \nthe dose of mifepristone (600 mg to 200 mg) and misoprostol (400 mcg to \n800 mcg).  FDA Summary Review of 2016 Amendments at 2. \nFDA admits that none of the studies it relied on examined the effect \nof implementing all of those changes together.  It studied the amendments \nindividually.  FDA Medical Review of 2016 Amendments at 32–38 (Mar. 29, \n2016) (gestational age); id. at 38–41 (in-person appointments); id. at 43–44 \n44 \n\nCase: 23-10362      Document: 543-1     Page: 45     Date Filed: 08/16/2023\nNo. 23-10362 \n(prescription by non-physician).  And some clinical trials considered “multi-\nple changes.”  FDA Summary Review of 2016 Amendments at 5–9.  But FDA \nneither considered the effects as a whole, nor explained why it declined to do \nso.  The cumulative effect of the 2016 Amendments is unquestionably an im-\nportant aspect of the problem; indeed, that was the whole point of FDA’s \naction.  Because FDA failed to seek data on the cumulative effect, and failed \nto explain why it did not, its decision to approve the amendments was likely \narbitrary and capricious.  Michigan, 576 U.S. at 752; State Farm, 463 U.S. at \n43; Sw. Elec. Power Co., 920 F.3d at 1019. \nFDA and Danco defend the 2016 Amendments, asserting that FDA is \nnot required to conduct a study that perfectly mirrors the conditions under \nwhich the drug will be used.  That is true, so far as it goes.  Indeed, the APA \ngives agencies discretion “in determining whether a study is adequate and \nwell controlled.”  FDA Br. at 43 (quoting Weinberger v. Hynson, Westcott & \nDunning, Inc., 412 U.S. 609, 621 n.17 (1973)). \nBut Defendants attack a rule that is not at issue.  The problem is not \nthat FDA failed to conduct a clinical trial that included each of the proposed \nchanges as a control.  It is that FDA failed to address the cumulative effect at \nall.  At a minimum, the agency needed to acknowledge the question, deter-\nmine if the evidence before it adequately satisfied the concern, and explain \nits  reasoning.    See  All.  for  Hippocratic  Med.,  2023  WL  2913725,  at  *17 \n(“[FDA] relied on zero studies that evaluated the safety-and-effectiveness \nconsequences of the 2016 Major REMS Changes as a whole.  This deficiency \nshows that FDA failed to consider ‘an important aspect of the problem’ when \nit made the 2016 Major REMS Changes.”) (quoting Michigan, 576 U.S. at \n752).  FDA did not do those things, and so likely violated the APA. \nThe second important aspect that FDA failed to consider is whether \nit needed to continue to collect data of non-fatal adverse events in light of the \n45 \n\nCase: 23-10362      Document: 543-1     Page: 46     Date Filed: 08/16/2023\nNo. 23-10362 \n“major” changes to the mifepristone REMS.  When considering the data-\ncollection question, FDA reasoned that non-fatal adverse events did not have \nto be recorded because the risks associated with mifepristone were well \nknown.  FDA Summary Review of 2016 Amendments at 26 (“[A]fter 15 \nyears of reporting serious adverse events, the safety profile for Mifeprex is \nessentially unchanged.”).   \nBut FDA failed to account for the fact that it was about to significantly \nloosen mifepristone’s conditions for use.  At no point during the decision did \nthe agency acknowledge that the 2016 Amendments might alter the risk pro-\nfile.  And when FDA addressed this subject in its response to the 2019 citizen \npetition, it just referred back to its statement that the risks were minimal un-\nder the 2011 REMS.  See 2021 Denial Letter at 20.  We conclude that FDA \nignored “an  important aspect of the problem,” Michigan, 576 U.S. at 752 \n(quoting State Farm, 463 U.S. at 43), and that its explanation of the basis for \nthe change contains significant “shortcomings.”  Sw. Elec. Power Co., 920 \nF.3d at 1018–19.  This also likely violates the APA. \nDefendants respond that the change is insignificant because Danco re-\nmains obligated to report serious adverse events to FDA.  See FDA Br. at 53; \nDanco Br. 47 (citing 21 C.F.R. §§ 314.80, 314.98).  True, Danco is still sub-\nject to some reporting requirements, but these are significantly different than \nthe ones that were removed.  Before, prescribers were required to report cer-\ntain adverse events directly to FDA.  Given that prescribers interact with the \nwomen taking mifepristone, they are well placed to know if a patient actually \nexperiences an adverse event.  By contrast, Danco has no direct relationship \nwith Mifeprex patients and little ability to track events.  Like any member of \nthe public, Danco can access the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System \n(FAERS), a voluntary reporting website.  But prescribers are not required to \nlog non-fatal adverse events.  Indeed, no one is required to report anything \non FAERS.  Nor are prescribers required to report to Danco.  The end result \n46 \n\nCase: 23-10362      Document: 543-1     Page: 47     Date Filed: 08/16/2023\nNo. 23-10362 \nis that the removal of the adverse-event reporting requirement significantly \ndiminishes FDA’s ability to collect this data.  Danco’s residual reporting re-\nquirements do not cure this APA violation. \nC. 2021 Non-Enforcement Decision \nWe now assess whether the Medical Organizations and Doctors are \nlikely to succeed on their claim regarding the 2021 Non-Enforcement Deci-\nsion.  That decision essentially involves three parts.  First, in April 2021, \nFDA announced that it would temporarily suspend enforcement of the in-\nperson dispensing requirement in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.  Next, in \nDecember of that year, FDA stated its intent to eliminate the requirement \npermanently.  See 2021 Denial Letter at 25 (“[W]e believe that the Mifepris-\ntone REMS Program must be modified to remove the requirement that mif-\nepristone be dispensed only in certain healthcare settings . . . because this \nrequirement is no longer necessary to ensure that the benefits of the drug \noutweigh the risks.”).  And then in January 2023, FDA amended mifepris-\ntone’s REMS, for Mifeprex and the generic, formalizing the change. \nFDA supported its decision by pointing to two sources of information.  \nFirst, the agency examined adverse-events data collected during the period \nof time when the in-person dispensing requirement was enjoined.  FDA ob-\ntained this data from FAERS—the voluntary reporting website.  2021 Denial \nLetter at 26.  Danco also submitted its records of adverse events during the \nrelevant interval, but its data set was the same as the one obtained via FAERS.  \nId. at 27 (“The information provided by the Applicants included the same \ncases identified in FAERS . . . .”).  Five events7 were reported during that \n_____________________ \n7 According to FDA, the causes of those events are as follows: ongoing pregnancy, \ndrug intoxication and death, death (unknown cause), sepsis and death, and pulmonary em-\nbolism.  2021 Denial Letter at 26. \n47 \n\nCase: 23-10362      Document: 543-1     Page: 48     Date Filed: 08/16/2023\nNo. 23-10362 \ntime, but FDA concluded that there did not “appear to be a difference in \nadverse events when in-person dispensing was and was not enforced.”  Id. \nSecond, FDA considered published literature relating to remote pre-\nscription of mifepristone.  It determined that those studies were “not incon-\nsistent with our conclusion that . . . mifepristone will remain safe and efficacy \nwill be maintained if the in-person dispensing requirement is removed from \nthe Mifepristone REMS Program.”  Id. at 28.  Based on these sources, FDA \nconcluded that “mifepristone will remain safe and effective if the in-person \ndispensing requirement is removed.”  Id. at 35. \n1. Mootness \nDefendants first raise a threshold question: whether the Medical Or-\nganizations and Doctors’ challenge to the 2021 non-enforcement policy is \nmoot.  They contend that the 2023 modification of mifepristone’s REMS su-\npersedes the 2021 policy, and also that the prior policy was tied to the Gov-\nernment’s COVID-19 public health emergency, which has since expired.  For \nthese reasons, FDA and Danco say, there is no longer a live dispute as to the \n2021 Non-Enforcement Decision.   \nNeither reason is availing.  First, FDA is incorrect to say that it tied \nits December 2021 decision not to enforce the in-person dispensing require-\nment to the COVID-19 pandemic.  True, FDA cited the pandemic as a justi-\nfication for taking the initial action.  FDA Letter of April 2021 at 2 (“[FDA] \nintends to exercise enforcement discretion during the COVID-19 [pandemic] \nwith respect to the in-person dispensing requirement of the Mifepristone \nREMS Program . . . .”).  But when FDA “directed mifepristone’s sponsors \nto submit a proposed REMS modification,” several months later, it did so \nwithout regard to pandemic conditions.  FDA Br. at 11; see 2021 Denial Letter \nat 6, 25–26.  FDA simply did not tether its action in December of 2021 to the \ncontinued existence of the public health emergency. \n48 \n\nCase: 23-10362      Document: 543-1     Page: 49     Date Filed: 08/16/2023\nNo. 23-10362 \nSecond, FDA’s formalization of the policy it announced in 2021 does \nnot render this claim moot.  At bottom, the mootness doctrine asks whether \nthe court faces a live dispute.  Freedom from Religion Found., Inc. v. Abbott, 58 \nF.4th 824, 831 (5th Cir. 2023).  That is, a case is moot if “the parties lack a \nlegally cognizable interest in the outcome.”  Id. (quoting Already, LLC v. \nNike, Inc., 568 U.S. 85, 91, (2013)).   \nA live dispute exists as to the 2021 Non-Enforcement Decision.  The \ndecision that FDA made in 2021—to permanently not enforce in-person pre-\nscription and dispensing requirements—remains in force. FDA may have \nformalized that policy by modifying the mifepristone REMS.  But the effect \nis the same, as is FDA’s ultimate judgment that mifepristone can be safely \nused without in-person prescription and dispensing. \nMoreover, the Supreme Court has recognized that the government \ndoes not moot a controversy when it introduces the final form of a previous, \nidentical policy.  Biden v. Texas, 142 S. Ct. 2528, 2544–45 (2022) (considering \na prior agency action even after it was formalized by a later, similar action); \nsee All. for Hippocratic Med., 2023 WL 2913725, at *2 n.2.  That type of action \nis different in kind than the repeal or modification of a government policy.  \nFreedom from Religion Found., 58 F.4th at 832.  Unlike a repealed policy, \nFDA’s policy remains unchanged and on the books (albeit in a permanent \nform).  We see no jurisdictional obstacle to reviewing the claim as to the 2021 \nNon-Enforcement Decision. \n2. Merits \nBecause the 2021 Non-Enforcement claim is not moot, we must pro-\nceed to the question of whether that action was arbitrary and capricious.  For \ntwo reasons, we hold that it likely was.  First, FDA gave dispositive weight to \nadverse-event data in FAERS—despite the uncontested limitations of doing \nso.  Recall that, because of the 2016 Amendments, FDA no longer had access \n49 \n\nCase: 23-10362      Document: 543-1     Page: 50     Date Filed: 08/16/2023\nNo. 23-10362 \nto perhaps the best source of data: the prescribers.  The agency is responsible \nfor its own inability to obtain probative data; it cannot then cite its lack of \ninformation as an argument in favor of removing further safeguards.  As the \nmotions panel aptly put it: “It’s unreasonable for an agency to eliminate a \nreporting requirement for a thing and then use the resulting absence of data \nto support its decision.”  All. for Hippocratic Med., 2023 WL 2913725, at *17.  \nMoreover, considerable evidence shows that FAERS data is insuffi-\ncient to draw general conclusions about adverse events.  Indeed, in describing \nthe database, FDA itself recognizes that “FAERS data cannot be used to cal-\nculate the incidence of an adverse event or medication error in the U.S. pop-\nulation.”  FDA admits that FAERS reporting is purely voluntary, FDA Br. \nat 53; consequently, many adverse events will go unreported. \nFor example, one doctor testified that she obtained adverse-event data \nfrom one provider (Planned Parenthood) and compared it to FAERS data for \nthe same time period.  For 2010, the provider reported 1,530 adverse events, \nwhereas FAERS reported only 664 events for all providers nationwide.  Dr. \nHarrison Declaration ¶ 17; see also id. (“These discrepancies render FAERS \ninadequate to evaluate the safety of mifepristone abortions.”).   \nIn addition, the Doctors introduced evidence that many physicians do \nnot use FAERS, either because they are not aware of the system or because \nthey believe that using the system is difficult, and takes time away from their \nordinary medical practice: \nMany doctors likely do not know about the need to report ad-\nverse events related to chemical abortion to the FDA.  Simi-\nlarly, many doctors likely do not know how to report adverse \nevents. . . .  I personally know of practitioners . . . who have \ntried to report adverse events related to chemical abortion \ndrugs to the FDA.  The process is complicated, cumbersome, \nand time-consuming.  The adverse event reporting require-\n50 \n\nCase: 23-10362      Document: 543-1     Page: 51     Date Filed: 08/16/2023\nNo. 23-10362 \nments and the FAERS submission process harm medical prac-\ntices by taking away significant time from a doctor to treat and \nmeet with patients. \nDr. Harrison Declaration ¶¶ 33–34; see also Dr. Frost-Clark Declaration ¶ 23 \n(“I have not reported adverse events that I have witnessed as a result of \nchemical abortions because the process is so cumbersome.”).  One doctor \ntestified that it can take hours to report an adverse event to FAERS: \n[T]he process of reporting to [FAERS] is also cumbersome.  \nThe actual form to be filled out is not easy to find online—re-\nquiring several steps to get it.  It once took me two hours to get \nthe website to accept submission of the form, taking me away \nfrom the care of my other patients.  The minimum amount of \ntime I have spent reporting a mifepristone complication to the \nFAERS is thirty minutes—valuable time that should be spent \nin patient care. \nDr. Francis Declaration ¶ 18.  FDA’s decision to rely so heavily on data from \nFAERS “runs counter to” the critical limitations associated with that data.  \nState Farm, 463 U.S. at 43; Sw. Elec. Power Co., 920 F.3d at 1018–19. \nFDA responds that it also considered adverse-event data submitted by \nDanco, but Danco’s data was exactly the same as the data FDA obtained from \nFAERS.   FDA acknowledged as much in its letter denying the 2019 citizen \npetition.  2021 Denial Letter at 27.  (“The information provided by the Ap-\nplicants included the same cases identified in FAERS . . . .”).  If anything, \nthe fact that Danco submitted identical data tends to confirm the assertion \nthat FDA lacked sufficient information; it shows that neither FDA nor Danco \nhad the means to collect data directly from prescribers. \nThe second defect in the Non-Enforcement Decision is that it relied \non various literature relating to remote prescription of mifepristone—despite \nFDA’s admission that the literature did not affirmatively support its position.  \nDanco insists that the studies “all . . . supported the conclusion that mife-\n51 \n\nCase: 23-10362      Document: 543-1     Page: 52     Date Filed: 08/16/2023\nNo. 23-10362 \npristone would still be safe and effective even with a relaxed in-person dis-\npensing requirement,” Danco Br. at 48, but that is not what FDA said in \n2021.  On the contrary, FDA candidly acknowledged that the literature was \nonly “not inconsistent with [its] conclusion.”  2021 Denial Letter at 28.  In \nother words, the studies neither confirmed nor rejected the idea that mife-\npristone would be safe if the in-person dispensing requirement were re-\nmoved.  In discussing the various studies, FDA recognized many significant \nlimitations: \nWe note that the ability to generalize the results of these stud-\nies to the United States population is hampered by differences \nbetween the studies with regard to pre-abortion care (e.g., tel-\nemedicine versus in-person).  In addition, the usefulness of the \nstudies is limited in some instances by small sample sizes and \nlack of follow-up information on outcomes with regard to both \nsafety and efficacy. \nThere are also factors which complicate the analysis of the dis-\npensing element alone.  Some of these factors are: (1) only a \nfew studies have evaluated alternatives for in-person dispens-\ning of mifepristone in isolation (for example, most studies on \nmail dispensing of mifepristone also include telemedicine con-\nsultation); and (2) because most serious adverse events with \nmedical abortion are infrequent, further evaluation of changes \nin dispensing would require studies with larger numbers of par-\nticipants.  We did not find any large clinical studies that were \ndesigned to collect safety outcomes in healthcare systems sim-\nilar to the United States. \nId.  Given those limitations, FDA concluded that the studies were “not ade-\nquate on their own to establish the safety of the model of dispensing mifepris-\ntone by mail.”  Id. at 35. \nEspecially in light of the unreliability of the adverse-event data, it was \nnot reasonable for FDA to depend on the published literature to support its \n52 \n\nCase: 23-10362      Document: 543-1     Page: 53     Date Filed: 08/16/2023\nNo. 23-10362 \ndecision.  Courts must set aside agency action where there are “shortcomings \nin the agency’s explanations” or where “[n]o record evidence affirmatively \nmakes” the agency’s case.  Sw. Elec. Power Co., 920 F.3d at 1018–19; see also \nState Farm, 463 U.S. at 56 (“While [an] agency is entitled to change its view \n. . . it is obligated to explain its reasons for doing so.”).  That is the case here. \nIn the face of concededly limited data, and lacking more probative in-\nformation from prescribers, FDA fell back on studies that were merely “not \ninconsistent” with its intended conclusion.  It did not refer to any literature \nthat affirmatively supported the notion that mifepristone would remain safe \nand effective even without the in-person dispensing requirement.  We con-\nclude that the Medical Organizations and Doctors are likely to succeed in \nshowing that this action violated the APA.8 \nIV. Irreparable Harm and Balance of the Equities \nWe now proceed to the remaining steps of the preliminary-injunction \nanalysis.  First, we ask if the Medical Organizations and Doctors are likely to \nsustain irreparable harm absent an injunction.  Garcia, 910 F.3d at 190.  If so, \nwe then balance the equities and consider whether an injunction serves the \npublic interest.  Winter, 555 U.S. at 20.  And where the government appeals \nan injunction, its interests “merge” with the public interest.  Tex. Democratic \nParty v. Abbott, 961 F.3d 389, 412 (5th Cir. 2020) (quoting Veasey v. Abbott, \n870 F.3d 387, 391 (5th Cir. 2017)). \nWe have already concluded that the Medical Organizations and Doc-\ntors are likely to sustain injury; now we need only determine whether the \nthreatened injuries are irreparable.  They are.  An irreparable harm is one \n_____________________ \n8 Given this holding, we do not consider the Medical Organizations and Doctors’ \nindependent argument that the 2021 Non-Enforcement Decision violates the Comstock \nAct of 1873. \n53 \n\nCase: 23-10362      Document: 543-1     Page: 54     Date Filed: 08/16/2023\nNo. 23-10362 \n“for which there is no adequate remedy at law.”  Louisiana v. Biden, 55 F.4th \n1017, 1033–34 (5th Cir. 2022) (quoting Daniels Health Scis., LLC v. Vascular \nHealth Scis., LLC, 710 F.3d 579, 585 (5th Cir. 2013)).  No legal remedy can \nadequately redress the Doctors’ conscience and mental-distress injuries.  \nAnd the economic injuries—the potential damage to their medical practice, \nheightened exposure to malpractice liability, and increased insurance costs—\nare irreparable too.  Monetary harm cannot be remedied where, as here, the \ndefendant is entitled to sovereign immunity.  See Wages & White Lion Invs., \nLLC v. FDA, 16 F.4th 1130, 1142 (5th Cir. 2021). \nThis risk of irreparable harm must be weighed against any injury FDA \nand Danco would sustain as a result of the stay order, as well as against the \npublic interest.  Starting with FDA, we recognize that anytime the Govern-\nment is enjoined from enforcing its statutes or regulations, “it suffers a form \nof irreparable injury.”  Maryland v. King, 567 U.S. 1301, 1303 (2012) (Rob-\nerts, C.J., in chambers); accord Valentine v. Collier, 956 F.3d 797, 803 (5th Cir. \n2020).  But on the other hand, neither FDA nor the public has any interest in \nenforcing  a regulation that violates federal law.  Louisiana, 55 F.4th at 1035 \n(“There is generally no public interest in the perpetuation of unlawful agency \naction.”) (citations omitted). \nIn this regard, the government/public-interest analysis collapses with \nthe merits.  See Sierra Club v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng’rs, 990 F. Supp. 2d 9, \n43 (D.D.C. 2013) (Jackson, J.) (explaining that “public interest arguments” \nare “derivative of . . . merits arguments and depend in large part on the vital-\nity of the latter”) (citing Serono Lab’ys, Inc. v. Shalala, 158 F.3d 1313, 1326 \n(D.C. Cir. 1998)); see also Louisiana, 55 F.4th at 1035; League of Women Voters \nof U.S. v. Newby, 838 F.3d 1, 12 (D.C. Cir. 2016).  The Medical Organizations \nand Doctors are likely to succeed on their claims as to the 2016 Amendments \nand 2021 Non-Enforcement Decision.  It follows that FDA and the public \nwill not be injured by an order staying those likely unlawful actions. \n54 \n\nCase: 23-10362      Document: 543-1     Page: 55     Date Filed: 08/16/2023\nNo. 23-10362 \nFDA also points to the “disruptive practical effects” of a stay, FDA \nBr. at 66–67, arguing that it will incur substantial costs if it complies with the \nstay order, only for the order to be reversed later.  As a preliminary matter, \nthis argument is also highly duplicative of the merits.  FDA’s injury only \ncomes into play if the stay order is vacated—that is, if the Medical Organiza-\ntions and Doctors are not likely to succeed on the merits.  After careful con-\nsideration, we have concluded that these claims are likely to succeed.  Ac-\ncordingly, we do not consider the costs that might be incurred if the stay or-\nder goes into effect and is later vacated.  Moreover, we doubt whether an \nagency’s interim compliance costs could outweigh a threat of irreparable \nharm.  See Al Otro Lado v. Wolf, 952 F.3d 999, 1008 (9th Cir. 2020). \nTurning to Danco’s interest, we acknowledge that the district court’s \nstay order would impose significant injury.  See Texas v. EPA, 829 F.3d 405, \n434 (5th Cir. 2016) (explaining that financial harm may be irreparable “where \nthe loss threatens the very existence of the [party’s] business”) (quoting Wis. \nGas Co. v. FERC, 758 F.2d 669, 674 (D.C. Cir. 1985)).  That threat, however, \nis substantially lessened because we vacate the component of the stay order \nthat would pause FDA’s initial approval of mifepristone in 2000. \nWhat remains is any injury that Danco will face as a result of the stay \norder as amended.  The Medical Organizations and Doctors point out that \nDanco already has drug labels and documentation that comply with the mif-\nepristone REMS as of 2011.  Danco does not deny this, but responds that \n“[r]equiring a return to a prior and outdated REMS and label would also cre-\nate months-long loss of access, while FDA and Danco work through the \nsNDA process.”  Danco Br. at 61 (citing Declaration of Dr. Janet Woodcock \n¶ 14).  But this potential injury is greatly diminished by the fact that the Su-\npreme Court’s stay of the district court’s order will remain in effect pending \ndisposition of any petition for certiorari. \n55 \n\nCase: 23-10362      Document: 543-1     Page: 56     Date Filed: 08/16/2023\nNo. 23-10362 \nIt is a well-established maxim that “equity regards substance rather \nthan form.”  Dobbs, 1 Law of Remedies 83 (2d ed. 1993).  This means, among \nother things, that courts exercising equitable power should account for the \nreal, boots-on-the-ground circumstances, not those supposed or theorized by \nthe parties.  As Pomeroy has explained: \nEquity always attempts to get at the substance of things, and to \nascertain, uphold, and enforce rights and duties which spring \nfrom the real relations of parties.  It will never suffer the mere \nappearance and external form to conceal the true purposes, ob-\njects, and consequences of a transaction. \nPomeroy, II Equity Jurisprudence § 378 (5th ed. 1941); see, e.g., Freedom from \nReligion Found., 58 F.4th at 837.  Applying this principle, we must take into \nconsideration the fact that the district court’s stay order will likely not go into \neffect for several months, if not more than a year. \nThe Supreme Court’s stay alleviates (or at least greatly reduces) any \npossible harm to Danco because it establishes a substantial window to prepare \nto comply with the district court’s stay order, as modified by this court.  The \nsoonest the district court’s stay order could go into effect would be if neither \nparty filed a petition for certiorari, and the deadline to do so is ninety days \nafter the entry of this court’s judgment.  Sup. Ct. R. 13.  Alternatively, if ei-\nther of the Defendants seek certiorari, the stay will remain in effect at least \nuntil the denial of that petition, should it be denied.  But even that would \nlikely require a minimum of six months for briefing by the parties and dispo-\nsition by the Supreme Court.  And if the Court grants the writ, that would \nextend the stay for upwards of another year.  Either way, Danco will have \n“months” of time needed to arrange for mifepristone to be distributed under \nthe 2011 REMS  and prevent any “loss of access.” \nOther public-interest considerations merit discussion.  Various amici \nassert that eliminating access to mifepristone, even temporarily, may pose \n56 \n\nCase: 23-10362      Document: 543-1     Page: 57     Date Filed: 08/16/2023\nNo. 23-10362 \nhealth risks to certain women, including those who use the drug to manage \nmiscarriage.  Br. of American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists et \nal. at 21–26; Br. of Physicians for Reproductive Health at 18–27; Br. of Over \n200 Reproductive Health, Rights, and Justice Organizations at 14–25; Br. of \nDoctors for America et al. at 14–23; Br. of Advocates for Survivors of Inti-\nmate Partner Violence at 18–26.  Other amici argue that “disrupting access \nto mifepristone” would burden state and local health-care systems.   Br. of \nNew York et al. at 4; see also Br. of Local Governments at 24–26; Br. of the \nCity of New York et al. at 8–31; Br. of Medical Students for Choice at 3–22.  \nAnd still other amici say that staying FDA’s approval of mifepristone would \ndestabilize  the  pharmaceutical  industry,  especially  research-and-develop-\nment sections.  Br. of Pharmaceutical Companies, Executives, and Investors \nat 3–4; Br. of Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America et al. \nat 22–26; Br. of Patient and Provider Advocacy Organizations at 9–20.   \nThese concerns are not insignificant.  But they apply primarily (if not \nwholly) to the challenge to the 2000 Approval—a claim that we have con-\ncluded is not likely to succeed.  All. for Hippocratic Med., 2023 WL 2913725, \nat *20 (“[T]hese concerns center on the district court’s removal of mifepris-\ntone from the market.  [Defendants] make no arguments as to why the 2016 \nMajor REMS Changes, the 2019 Generic Approval, or the 2021 and 2023 \nMail Order Decisions are similarly critical to the public . . . .”).  Insofar as \nthese concerns translate to the 2016 Amendments and 2021 Non-Enforce-\nment Decision, they are lessened by the fact that mifepristone would remain \navailable under the 2011 REMS, as would options for surgical abortion. \nAnd of course, the public interest is disserved by a drug that does not \nafford adequate protections to its users.  See Deerfield Med. Ctr. v. City of \nDeerfield Beach, 661 F.2d 328, 338 (5th Cir. 1981); Hill Dermaceuticals, Inc. v. \nFDA, 524 F. Supp. 2d 5, 12 (D.D.C. 2007) (“[T]he public interest weighs \nstrongly in favor of preventing unsafe drugs from entering the market.”).  To \n57 \n\nCase: 23-10362      Document: 543-1     Page: 58     Date Filed: 08/16/2023\nNo. 23-10362 \nbe clear, the evidence does not show that mifepristone is unsafe in all appli-\ncations.  But on this record and at this preliminary stage, the Medical Organ-\nizations and Doctors have made a substantial showing that the 2016 Amend-\nments and 2021 Non-Enforcement Decision were taken without sufficient \nconsideration of the effects those changes would have on patients. \nWeighing all of these considerations, we conclude that the balance of \nthe equities favors the Medical Organizations and Doctors.  They face a sub-\nstantial risk of irreparable harm to their medical practice, mental and emo-\ntional health, and conscience.  The limited relief affirmed by our judgment \nthreatens neither FDA nor Danco with substantial harm.  Nor does it offend \nthe public interest.  The Medical Organizations and Doctors therefore satisfy \nthe remaining preliminary-injunction factors.  Winter, 555 U.S. at 20. \nV. Form of Relief \nFinally, FDA and Danco challenge the form of the relief entered by \nthe district court—a stay of the actions’ effective dates.  FDA argues that the \nMedical Organizations and Doctors were required to first seek an adminis-\ntrative stay, but failed to do so.  See 21 C.F.R. § 10.45(c) (“A request that \nadministrative action be stayed must first be the subject of an administrative \ndecision based upon a petition for stay of action . . . before a request is made \nthat a court stay the action.”).  It also contends that § 705 authorizes only \nrequests made at the same time the challenged action is enacted.  Here, by \ncontrast, the Medical Organizations and Doctors seek a stay years after the \nrelevant policies took effect.  And Danco maintains that injunctive relief is \ncategorically unavailable, reasoning that if the Medical Organizations and \nDoctors prevailed, they would only be entitled to remand without vacatur. \nWe hold that the district court entered an appropriate form of relief.  \nTo begin, consider the nature of a “stay” under § 705.  In the same way that \na preliminary injunction is the temporary form of a permanent injunction, a \n58 \n\nCase: 23-10362      Document: 543-1     Page: 59     Date Filed: 08/16/2023\nNo. 23-10362 \nstay is the temporary form of vacatur.  Between vacatur and an injunction, \nthe former is the “less drastic remedy.”  Monsanto Co. v. Geertson Seed Farms, \n561 U.S. 139, 165 (2010).  That is so because vacatur does not order the de-\nfendant to do anything; it only removes the source of the defendant’s author-\nity.  See Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 428–29 (2009) (“[A] stay achieves this \nresult by temporarily suspending the source of authority to act—the order or \njudgment in question—not by directing an actor’s conduct.”); see also Texas \nv. United States, 40 F.4th 205, 220 (5th Cir. 2022) (“Apart from the consti-\ntutional or statutory basis on which the court invalidated an agency action, \nvacatur neither compels nor restrains . . . agency decision-making.”).   \nUpon a successful APA claim, vacatur effectively rescinds the unlaw-\nful agency action.  See Data Mktg. P’ship, LP v. U.S. Dep’t of Lab., 45 F.4th \n846, 859 (5th Cir. 2022) (“Vacatur . . . retroactively undoes or expunges a \npast state action. . . . Unlike an injunction, which merely blocks enforcement, \nvacatur unwinds the challenged agency action.”) (quoting Driftless Area \nLand Conservancy v. Valcq, 16 F.4th 508, 522 (7th Cir. 2021)).  Keeping with \nthe preliminary-permanent injunction analogy, a stay temporarily voids the \nchallenged authority. \nPractically speaking, a stay means that—while the order is in effect—\nDanco will have legal authority to market and sell Mifeprex under the condi-\ntions that were in effect before 2016.  Likewise, GenBioPro will have author-\nity to market and sell the generic version of mifepristone under those same \nconditions—that is, those that appeared in the 2011 REMS. The in-person \ndispensing requirements, and FDA’s obligation to enforce them, will con-\ntinue to apply.   \nIn terms of enforcement, unlike with a preliminary injunction, a stay \ndoes not actively prohibit conduct, and so does not carry the same threat of \ncontempt.  Plaintiffs could move to enforce the stay in the unlikely event that \n59 \n\nCase: 23-10362      Document: 543-1     Page: 60     Date Filed: 08/16/2023\nNo. 23-10362 \nFDA or Danco took some action to violate it.  But of course, we have abso-\nlutely no reason to believe that such a motion would be necessary.  And we \nshould reiterate that the Supreme Court’s stay of the district court’s order \nwill remain in effect pending disposition of any petition for certiorari. \nTurning to Danco’s objection to a stay, we do not agree that the Med-\nical Organizations and Doctors will be limited to remand without vacatur if \nthey obtain a favorable judgment.  “[V]acatur of an agency action is the de-\nfault rule in this Circuit.”  Cargill v. Garland, 57 F.4th 447, 472 (5th Cir. \n2023) (en banc) (plurality op.); Data Mktg. P’ship, 45 F.4th at 859; accord \nUnited Steel v. Mine Safety & Health Admin., 925 F.3d 1279, 1287 (D.C. Cir. \n2019) (“The ordinary practice is to vacate unlawful agency action.”).  Given \nthat presumption, remand without vacatur is appropriate only if “there is at \nleast a serious possibility that the agency will be able to substantiate its deci-\nsion given an opportunity to do so.”  Texas v. United States, 50 F.4th 498, 529 \n(5th Cir. 2022) (quoting Texas Assn. of Mfrs. v. U.S. Consumer Prod. Safety \nComm’n, 989 F.3d 368, 389–90 (5th Cir. 2021)); accord Radio-Television News \nDirs. Ass’n v. FCC, 184 F.3d 872, 888 (D.C. Cir. 1999). \nRemand without vacatur is likely not appropriate because “it is far \nfrom certain” that FDA could cure its mistakes with further consideration.  \nEnv’t Def. Fund v. FERC, 2 F.4th 953, 976 (D.C. Cir. 2021).  FDA erred by \nfailing to consider the cumulative effects of the 2016 Amendments on mife-\npristone’s safety and by disregarding the lack of recent data on adverse events \nwhen removing the in-person dispensing requirement.  The record does not \ntend to show that FDA would have arrived at the same decision if it had con-\nsidered those things.  See Oglala Sioux Tribe v. U.S. Nuclear Regul. Comm’n, \n896 F.3d 520, 536 (D.C. Cir. 2018) (declining to remand without vacatur be-\ncause of the “seriousness” of the action’s “deficiency”); Pollinator Steward-\nship Council v. EPA, 806 F.3d 520, 532 (9th Cir. 2015) (same); cf. Sierra Club \nv. FERC, 68 F.4th 630, 652 (D.C. Cir. 2023) (remanding without vacatur be-\n60 \n\nCase: 23-10362      Document: 543-1     Page: 61     Date Filed: 08/16/2023\nNo. 23-10362 \ncause it was possible that FERC could “adequately explain its decision” if \ngiven another opportunity).  If the Medical Organizations and Doctors suc-\nceed on the merits, it is likely that the default remedy—vacatur—will be ap-\npropriate.  And the temporary version of vacatur is a stay. \nWe are also unpersuaded by FDA’s contentions.  First, FDA argues \nMedical Organizations and Doctors cannot seek a stay before the district \ncourt because they failed to seek one from the agency.  But the record shows \nthat FDA would have denied any request for an administrative stay.  See Gulf \nRestoration Network v. Salazar, 683 F.3d 158, 176 (5th Cir. 2012).  FDA une-\nquivocally denied the 2019 citizen petition, rejecting the premise that 2016 \nAmendments made mifepristone less safe.  It discussed the 2021 Non-En-\nforcement Decision in the same document, and then formalized the policy in \n2023.  These pronouncements show that FDA was committed to implement-\ning these changes, and foreclose any notion that the agency would have \ngranted an administrative stay.  Tesoro Refin. & Mktg. Co. v. FERC, 552 F.3d \n868, 874 (D.C. Cir. 2009) (explaining that the exhaustion requirement does \nnot apply “when resort to administrative remedies [would be] clearly use-\nless”) (citations omitted).  That FDA denied a request to stay the 2000 Ap-\nproval further aids this conclusion.  See 2016 Denial Letter at 32 (“As de-\nscribed above, we are denying your Petition.  Therefore, your request for a \nstay pending final action on your Petition is moot.”). \nSecond,  FDA provides no authority for its assertion that § 705 of the \nAPA limits stays to contemporaneous agency actions.  The text does not pro-\nvide such a limitation.  Instead, it empowers a reviewing court to “issue all \nnecessary and appropriate process to postpone the effective date of an agency \naction or to preserve status or rights pending conclusion of the review pro-\nceedings.”  5 U.S.C. § 705.  Circuit courts have interpreted this statute as \nproviding something akin to the general stay power recognized by Rule 18 of \nthe Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, see Ohio v. Nuclear Regul. Comm’n, \n61 \n\nCase: 23-10362      Document: 543-1     Page: 62     Date Filed: 08/16/2023\nNo. 23-10362 \n812 F.2d 288, 290 (6th Cir. 1987); In re GTE Serv. Corp., 762 F.2d 1024, 1026 \n(D.C. Cir. 1985), which weighs against construing § 705 as requiring that a \nstay be issued concurrently with an agency action.  We are disinclined to \nreach a definitive answer on this question, given the cursory treatment by \nboth parties.  But we strongly doubt that § 705 should be read to impose the \nlimit urged by FDA.  Nothing about this argument persuades us that the dis-\ntrict court abused its discretion by entering this particular form of relief. \nVI. Conclusion \nFor the foregoing reasons, the stay order entered by the district court \nis VACATED in part and AFFIRMED in part.  We vacate the component \nof the order that stayed the effective date of the 2000 Approval and the 2019 \nGeneric  Approval.    Mifeprex  will  remain  available  under  the  safety  re-\nstrictions that were in effect prior to 2016.  Generic mifepristone will also \nremain available under those same restrictions. \nWe affirm the portions of the stay order regarding the 2016 Amend-\nments and the 2021 Non-Enforcement Decision.  In loosening mifepristone’s \nsafety restrictions, FDA failed to address several important concerns about \nwhether the drug would be safe for the women who use it.  It failed to consider \nthe cumulative effect of removing several important safeguards at the same \ntime.    It  failed  to  consider  whether  those  “major”  and  “interrelated” \nchanges might alter the risk profile, such that the agency should continue to \nmandate reporting of non-fatal adverse events.  And it failed to gather evi-\ndence that affirmatively showed that mifepristone could be used safely with-\nout being prescribed and dispensed in person. \nAt this preliminary stage, the Medical Organizations and Doctors \nhave made a substantial showing that the 2016 Amendments and the 2021 \nNon-Enforcement Decision violate the APA.  Accordingly, those actions will \nbe stayed pending final judgment.  But to repeat, all of this relief is subject to \n62 \n\nCase: 23-10362      Document: 543-1     Page: 63     Date Filed: 08/16/2023\nNo. 23-10362 \nthe Supreme Court’s prior order, which stays the district court’s order until \nthe disposition of any petition for certiorari.\n63 \n\nCase: 23-10362      Document: 543-1     Page: 64     Date Filed: 08/16/2023\nNo. 23-10362 \nJames C. Ho, Circuit Judge, concurring in part and dissenting in part: \nThe Constitution vests “the authority to regulate abortion” in “the \npeople and their elected representatives.”  Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health \nOrg., 142 S. Ct. 2228, 2279 (2022).  Congress has enacted a number of laws \nthat affect the regulation of abortion, including the Administrative Procedure \nAct and the Comstock Act.  Those laws dictate the outcome in this case. \nCongress has conferred significant regulatory power on administrative \nagencies such as the FDA.  In exchange, Congress has enacted the APA to \nensure that agency action is subject to meaningful judicial review.  It requires \ncourts to “hold unlawful and set aside agency action” that we determine to \nbe  “arbitrary,  capricious,  an  abuse  of  discretion,  or  otherwise  not  in \naccordance with law.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).   \nThat’s precisely what occurred here.  Plaintiffs challenge the FDA’s \napproval of mifepristone in 2000, as well as its 2016 and 2021 revisions to its \nmifepristone regulations.  I agree with the panel majority that the FDA’s \n2016 and 2021 revisions to its mifepristone regulations must be set aside as \narbitrary and capricious under the APA.  I would add that the FDA’s initial \napproval of mifepristone in 2000 also violates the agency’s own rules and \nthus must be set aside under the APA as well. \nThe FDA approved mifepristone under its Subpart H regulations.  But \nSubpart H only authorizes the FDA to approve drugs that “treat[] serious or \nlife-threatening illnesses.”  21 C.F.R. § 314.500.  And pregnancy is plainly \nnot an illness.  So it was unlawful for the FDA to approve mifepristone under \nSubpart H.  To quote the Population Council, the entity that sought FDA \napproval  of  mifepristone  in  2000:    “Neither  pregnancy  nor  unwanted \npregnancy is an illness, and Subpart H is therefore inapplicable for that \nreason alone.”  Population Council Letter to FDA at 1–2 (Sep. 6, 2000).   \n64 \n\nCase: 23-10362      Document: 543-1     Page: 65     Date Filed: 08/16/2023\nNo. 23-10362 \nPerhaps the FDA could have approved mifepristone through some \nother regulatory process.  But established precedent requires us to review the \nFDA’s action based on the path it took—not the path it might have taken.  \nSee SEC v. Chenery Corp., 318 U.S. 80, 95 (1943); DHS v. Regents of the Univ. \nof Cal. 140 S. Ct. 1891, 1909 (2020) (“An agency must defend its actions \nbased on the reasons it gave when it acted.”). \nThe FDA’s 2021 revisions also violate the Comstock Act.  That Act \nmakes it a federal crime to mail any “article or thing designed . . . or intended \nfor  producing  abortion,”  as  well  as  any  “drug,  medicine,  or  thing . . . \nadvertised  . . .  in  a  manner  calculated  to  lead  another  to  use  . . .  it  for \nproducing abortion.”  18 U.S.C. § 1461.  It also makes it a crime to “use[] . . . \n[an] express company” to ship a “drug, medicine, article, or thing designed \n. . . or intended for producing abortion.”  18 U.S.C. § 1462. \nSo I would affirm the district court.  Accordingly, I concur in part and \ndissent in part. \nI.  \n  I agree with the thorough and well-reasoned panel majority opinion \nthat Plaintiffs have demonstrated Article III standing to challenge both the \nFDA’s 2000 approval of mifepristone and the 2016 and 2021 revisions.  I \nwrite  separately  to  elaborate  on  the  historical  pedigree  of  Plaintiffs’ \nconscience injury, and to explore how Plaintiffs suffer aesthetic injury as well. \nA. \n  The Supreme Court has instructed that we look to “history and \ntradition” as “a meaningful guide to the types of cases that Article III \nempowers federal courts to consider.”  United States v. Texas, 143 S. Ct. 1964, \n1970 (2023) (quoting Sprint Communications Co. v. APCC Services, Inc., 554 \nU.S. 269, 274 (2008)).  We ask whether the “injury to the plaintiff has a \n65 \n\nCase: 23-10362      Document: 543-1     Page: 66     Date Filed: 08/16/2023\nNo. 23-10362 \n‘close relationship’ to a harm ‘traditionally’ recognized as providing a basis \nfor a lawsuit in American courts.”  TransUnion LLC v. Ramirez, 141 S. Ct. \n2190, 2204 (2021) (quoting Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins, 578 U.S. 330, 341 (2016)).  \n  By the standards of history and tradition, the harm to conscience that \nPlaintiffs suffer is a paradigmatically cognizable injury.  American law has \nrecognized conscience rights from the start.  See, e.g., N.H. Const. of \n1784, pt. I, art. IV (“Among the natural rights, some are in their very nature \nunalienable, because no equivalent can be given or received for them.  Of this \nkind are the rights of conscience.”); Pa. Const. of 1790, art. IX, \n§ 3 (“[N]o human authority can, in any case whatever, control or interfere \nwith the rights of conscience.”); Ky. Const. of 1792, art. XII, § 3 (same); \nOhio Const. of 1803, art. VIII, § 3 (same); Ala. Const. of 1819, art. I, \n§ 4 (“No human authority ought, in any case whatever, to control or interfere \nwith the rights of conscience.”); Tenn. Const. of 1835, art. I, § 3 (“[N]o \nhuman authority can, in any case whatever, control or interfere with the \nrights of conscience.”); Mo. Const. of 1820, art. XIII, § 4 (“[N]o human \nauthority can control or interfere with the rights of conscience.”); Ark. \nConst.  of  1836,  art.  II,  § 3  (“[N]o  human  authority  can,  in  any  case \nwhatever, interfere with the rights of conscience.”); Wis. Const. of 1848, \nart. I, § 18 (“Nor shall any control of, or interference with the rights of \nconscience be permitted.”); Minn. Const. of 1858, art. I, § 16 (same); \nKan. Const. of 1859, Bill of Rights, § 7 (same). \n  Throughout the nineteenth century, American courts granted relief to \nparties who challenged government action as injurious to conscience.  See, \ne.g., White v. McBride, 7 Ky. (4 Bibb) 61, 61 (1815) (suit brought against sheriff \nby  plaintiffs  who  “entertained  conscientious  scruples  against  bearing \narms”); In re Dorsey, 7 Port. 293, 345, 365–69 (Ala. 1838) (attorney seeking \nconscience-based  exemption  from  anti-dueling  oath  required  for  bar \nadmission); State ex rel. Weiss v. Dist. Bd. of Sch. Dist. No. 8 of City of Edgerton, \n66 \n\nCase: 23-10362      Document: 543-1     Page: 67     Date Filed: 08/16/2023\nNo. 23-10362 \n44 N.W. 967, 967–68, 976 (Wis. 1890) (writ of mandamus requested by \npublic school students who raised conscience-based objection to curriculum).    \nAnd even where parties were not ultimately granted relief, courts \nentertained their suits alleging injuries to conscience and reached the merits \nof their claims.  See, e.g., Donahoe v. Richards, 38 Me. 379, 413 (1854) (public \nschool student raised conscience-based objection to curriculum); Innis v. \nBolton,  17  P.  264,  269  (Idaho  1888)  (plaintiff  brought  conscience-based \nobjection to anti-polygamy oath required for voting). \nHere, Plaintiffs have alleged conscience injuries analogous to those \nhistorically  recognized  at  law  and  in  equity.    The  FDA’s  approval  of \nmifepristone  creates  a  substantial  risk  that  Plaintiffs  will  be  forced  to \nparticipate in the abortion process.  See, e.g., Dr. Francis Declaration ¶ 14 \n(“[M]ore physicians with ethical and medical objections to abortion will be \nforced to participate in completing unfinished elective chemical abortions, \njust  as  my  partner  was.”);  Dr.  Skop  Declaration  ¶ 34  (“The  FDA’s \nexpansion of chemical abortion . . . harms my conscience rights because it \ncould force me to have to surgically finish an incomplete elective chemical \nabortion.  I object to abortion because it ends a human life.”). \nThe Supreme Court has recognized that intangible interests in free \nspeech and free exercise are sufficiently concrete for Article III standing.  See \nSpokeo, 578 U.S. at 340.  So it’s not surprising that both the FDA and \nintervenor Danco agree that conscience injuries can satisfy Article III.  I agree \nwith the panel majority that Plaintiffs have established Article III standing \nbased on injury to conscience. \nB. \n  In addition to the injuries analyzed by the majority, Plaintiffs have \ndemonstrated another basis for Article III standing:  the aesthetic injury they \nexperience in the course of their work.  See, e.g., Sierra Club v. Morton, 405 \n67 \n\nCase: 23-10362      Document: 543-1     Page: 68     Date Filed: 08/16/2023\nNo. 23-10362 \nU.S.  727,  734–35  (1972)  (recognizing  aesthetic  harm  as  “injury  to  a \ncognizable interest”); Lujan v. Defs. of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 562–63 (1992) \n(“[T]he desire to use or observe an animal species, even for purely esthetic \npurposes, is undeniably a cognizable interest for purpose of standing.”); id. \nat  566  (“[T]he  person  who  observes  or  works  with  a  particular  animal \nthreatened by a federal decision is facing perceptible harm.”). \n  It’s well established that, if a plaintiff has “concrete plans” to visit an \nanimal’s habitat and view that animal, that plaintiff suffers aesthetic injury \nwhen an agency has approved a project that threatens the animal.  See Lujan, \n504 U.S. at 564.  See also Humane Soc’y v. Hodel, 840 F.2d 45, 52 (D.C. Cir. \n1988) (standing where agency expanded approval for hunting, “depleting the \nsupply of animals . . . that . . . [plaintiffs] seek to view” and causing plaintiffs \nto witness “animal corpses”); Am. Bottom Conservancy v. Army Corps of \nEngineers, 650 F.3d 652, 657 (7th Cir. 2011) (standing for birdwatchers to \nchallenge agency permit that would allow development and thus “diminish \nthe wildlife population visible to them”); Ctr. for Biological Diversity v. EPA, \n861 F.3d 174, 183 (D.C. Cir. 2017) (standing where agency authorization to \nuse pesticide created “demonstrable risk” to beetles and butterflies that \nplaintiffs intended to view). \n  Unborn babies are a source of profound joy for those who view them.  \nExpectant parents eagerly share ultrasound photos with loved ones.  Friends \nand family cheer at the sight of an unborn child.  Doctors delight in working \nwith their unborn patients—and experience an aesthetic injury when they are \naborted. \n  Plaintiffs’ declarations illustrate that they experience aesthetic injury \nfrom the destruction of unborn life.  Dr. Francis testified to working with an \nunborn child who was subsequently killed by mifepristone:  \n68 \n\nCase: 23-10362      Document: 543-1     Page: 69     Date Filed: 08/16/2023\nNo. 23-10362 \n[A] partner of mine and I cared for another patient who also \nsuffered complications from chemical abortion.  I had taken \ncare of her when she was hospitalized . . . at 9 weeks 5 days \ngestation.  She was discharged home in good condition after \nsignificant  improvement  with  medications.    During  that \nhospital stay, she had an ultrasound, which showed a healthy \npregnancy with no apparent complications and a strong fetal \nheart rate. . . .  Approximately one week after her discharge, the \npatient presented back at our emergency room with heavy \nvaginal bleeding and unstable vital signs as a result of taking \nchemical abortion drugs.   \nDr. Francis Declaration ¶ 13. \nDr. Jester put Plaintiffs’ interest in unborn life this way: “When my \npatients have chemical abortions, I lose the opportunity . . . to care for the \nwoman and child through pregnancy and bring about a successful delivery of \nnew life.”  Dr. Jester Declaration ¶ 19.  See Ctr. for Biological Diversity v. EPA, \n937 F.3d 533, 541 (5th Cir. 2019) (recognizing judicially cognizable injury \nwhere plaintiff experiences aesthetic harm at work). \nThe Supreme Court has recognized that “the person who observes or \nworks with a particular animal threatened by a federal decision is facing \nperceptible harm, since the very subject of his interest will no longer exist.”  \nLujan, 504 U.S. at 566.  Every circuit, including our own, has concluded that, \nwhen a federal agency authorizes third parties to harm flora or fauna that a \nplaintiff intends to view or study, that satisfies all of the requirements for \nArticle III standing.  See, e.g., Housatonic River Initiative v. EPA, _ F.4th_, \n2023 WL 4730222, *9 (1st Cir. July 25, 2023); NRDC v. FAA, 564 F.3d 549, \n555 (2nd Cir. 2009); Sierra Club v. EPA, 972 F.3d 290, 298–99 (3rd Cir. \n2020); Sierra Club v. Dep’t of the Interior, 899 F.3d 260, 282–85 (4th Cir. \n2018); Gulf Restoration Network v. Salazar, 683 F.3d 158, 166–68 (5th Cir. \n2012); Meister v. Dep’t of Agriculture, 623 F.3d 363, 369–70 (6th Cir. 2010); \n69 \n\nCase: 23-10362      Document: 543-1     Page: 70     Date Filed: 08/16/2023\nNo. 23-10362 \nAm. Bottom Conservancy, 650 F.3d at 656–60; Sierra Club v. Army Corps of \nEngineers, 645 F.3d 978, 985–86 (8th Cir. 2011); Cottonwood Env’t Law Ctr. \nv.  Forest  Service,  789  F.3d  1075,  1079–83  (9th  Cir.  2015);  WildEarth \nGuardians v. EPA, 759 F.3d 1196, 1206–07 (10th Cir. 2014); Black Warrior \nRiverkeeper, Inc. v. Army Corps of Engineers, 781 F.3d 1271, 1280–83 (11th Cir. \n2015); Ctr. for Biological Diversity v. EPA, 56 F.4th 55, 66–69 (D.C. Cir. \n2022). \nIn all of these cases, a federal agency approved some action—such as \ndeveloping land or using pesticides—that threatens to destroy the animal or \nplant life that plaintiffs wish to enjoy.  This injury is redressable by a court \norder holding unlawful and setting aside the agency approval. \nAnd so too here.  The FDA has approved the use of a drug that \nthreatens to destroy the unborn children in whom Plaintiffs have an interest.  \nAnd this injury is likewise redressable by a court order holding unlawful and \nsetting aside approval of that abortifacient drug. \nI see no basis for allowing Article III standing based on aesthetic injury \nwhen it comes to animals and plants—but not unborn human life. \nII. \nI now turn specifically to Plaintiffs’ challenge to the FDA’s 2000 \napproval of mifepristone.  The FDA contends that the challenge is untimely.  \nBut it concedes that “the well-established reopening doctrine” is binding \nprecedent in this circuit.  Texas v. Biden, 20 F.4th 928, 951 (5th Cir. 2021), \nrev’d on other grounds, 142 S. Ct. 2528 (2022).  And it accepts that, under that \ndoctrine, the clock for an APA claim restarts when an agency revises its \nregulations  in  a  manner  that  “significantly  alters  the  stakes  of  judicial \nreview.”  Sierra Club v. EPA, 551 F.3d 1019, 1025 (D.C. Cir. 2008).  See also \nNRDC v. EPA, 571 F.3d 1245, 1266 (D.C. Cir. 2009) (same). \n70 \n\nCase: 23-10362      Document: 543-1     Page: 71     Date Filed: 08/16/2023\nNo. 23-10362 \nThat standard is easily met here.  It seems obvious that the 2016 and \n2021 revisions significantly altered the regulatory landscape.  Indeed, the \nFDA recently told the Supreme Court that setting aside those revisions \nwould  “upend  the  regulatory  regime  for  mifepristone”  and  “unleash[] \nregulatory chaos.”  Application to Stay the Order Entered by the United \nStates  District  Court  for  the  Northern  District  of  Texas  and  for  An \nAdministrative  Stay,  2023  WL  3127519,  at  *2–3,  FDA  v.  Alliance  for \nHippocratic Medicine, 143 S. Ct. 1075 (2023).  If switching from the 2016/2021 \nregime  to  the  2000-era  regime  significantly  alters  the  “basic  regulatory \nscheme,” NRDC, 571 F.3d at 1266, then surely the reverse does, too. \nSo the district court was correct that “FDA’s 2016 and 2021 Changes \n. . . significantly departed from the agency’s original approval of the abortion \nregimen.  FDA . . . altered its original decision by removing safeguards and \nchanging the regulatory scheme for chemical abortion drugs.”  Alliance for \nHippocratic Medicine v. FDA, _ F. Supp. 3d _, 2023 WL 2825871, at *11 (N.D. \nTex. Apr. 7, 2023).  As a result, the 2016 and 2021 revisions triggered the \nreopening doctrine.  Plaintiffs’ challenge to the 2000 approval is timely.  \nA. \nChallenges to federal administrative action are subject to a six-year \nstatute of limitations.  See 28 U.S.C. § 2401(a).  This six-year clock initially \nstarted ticking in March 2016, when the FDA denied Plaintiffs’ 2002 petition \nobjecting to the 2000 approval.  See 21 C.F.R. § 10.45(d).  Absent reopening, \nPlaintiffs’ challenge to the 2000 approval would be barred by this six-year \nstatute of limitations, because Plaintiffs filed this suit after March 2022.  \nBut  under  the  administrative  reopening  doctrine,  the  agency  can \nrestart the clock in two ways:  (1) if “the agency opened the issue up anew, \nand then reexamined and reaffirmed its prior decision,” NRDC, 571 F.3d at \n1265  (cleaned  up),  or  (2)  “if  the  revision  of  accompanying  regulations \n71 \n\nCase: 23-10362      Document: 543-1     Page: 72     Date Filed: 08/16/2023\nNo. 23-10362 \n‘significantly alters the stakes of judicial review’ as the result of a change that \n‘could have not been reasonably anticipated,’” id. at 1266 (quoting Sierra \nClub v. EPA, 551 F.3d 1019, 1025 (D.C. Cir. 2008)). \nThis second type of reopening is called “constructive reopening.”  Id.  \nI would hold that constructive reopening applies here, rendering Plaintiffs’ \nchallenge to the 2000 approval timely. \n“A constructive reopening occurs if the revision of . . . regulations \n‘significantly alters the stakes of judicial review.’”  Sierra Club, 551 F.3d at \n1025 (quoting Kennecott Utah Copper Corp. v. Dep’t of the Interior, 88 F.3d \n1191, 1227 (D.C. Cir. 1996)).  The paradigmatic example of this is when the \nagency unexpectedly removes “necessary safeguards,” thus giving “new \nsignificance” to the original action.   Id. at 1025–26. \nIn  Sierra  Club,  the  EPA’s  initial  1994  rule  exempted  pollutant-\nemitting  plants  from  emission  limits  when  the  plants  were  starting  up, \nshutting down, or malfunctioning.  See id. at 1022.  To be eligible for the \nexemption, a plant had to show it was doing its “reasonable best” to stay \nunder the emission limits.  Id. \nBut in the early 2000s, new EPA rules removed this “reasonable best” \nrequirement.  To qualify for the exemption, plants no longer had to show they \nwere doing their best to limit emissions.  See id. at 1023.  This elimination of \nsafeguards  “significantly  altered  the  stakes  of  judicial  review”  for  the \nenvironmental plaintiffs, thereby triggering reopening.  Id. at 1025 (cleaned \nup). \nThe same is true here.  Just as the EPA initially authorized emissions \nunder certain safeguards to minimize harm, the FDA initially authorized \nmifepristone under certain safeguards to minimize harm.  Remove these \nsafeguards, and you’ve significantly altered the stakes of judicial review.  The \n72 \n\nCase: 23-10362      Document: 543-1     Page: 73     Date Filed: 08/16/2023\nNo. 23-10362 \noriginal  scheme  is  now  much  more  “worth  challenging.”    Id.  at  1026 \n(quotation omitted).  \nB. \nPlaintiffs’ challenge to the 2000 approval easily satisfies the reopening \ndoctrine.  Both the 2016 and 2021 revisions made significant and unexpected \nalterations to the basic regulatory scheme.  They took away key safeguards, \nsignificantly raising the stakes of judicial review for the underlying approval.   \nWhen it approved mifepristone in 2000, the FDA included a number \nof “necessary safeguards” to minimize harm from this dangerous drug.  \nSierra Club, 551 F.3d at 1025.  For example, the FDA required an in-person \nfollow-up appointment to protect the woman from sepsis, which occurs if the \nchild’s remains are not removed from her body after the abortion.  See FDA \nApproval Memorandum to Population Council at 3 (Sep. 28, 2000).  It also \nlimited the use of mifepristone to the first seven weeks, ensuring that the \nabortion took place early in pregnancy.  See id. at 1.  And it required a \nphysician to supervise the administration of mifepristone, in order to “date \npregnancies and diagnose ectopic pregnancies.”  Id. at 5.  See also id. at 6 \n(same). \nThe 2016 amendments removed these key safeguards.  By approving \nthe abortifacient for use up to ten weeks, by allowing non-physicians to \nprescribe and administer the drug, and by removing the in-person follow-up \nrequirement, the 2016 revisions significantly altered the stakes of judicial \nreview.  “These are not mere ‘minor changes.’”  Sierra Club, 551 F.3d at \n1025.    By  modifying  its  original  restrictions,  the  FDA  constructively \nreopened the drug’s approval. \nThe 2016 amendments became final in 2021, when the FDA denied \nthe 2019 Petition challenging them.  See 21 C.F.R. § 10.45(d).  Plaintiffs’ \nchallenge is therefore timely. \n73 \n\nCase: 23-10362      Document: 543-1     Page: 74     Date Filed: 08/16/2023\nNo. 23-10362 \n  The 2021 Mail-Order Decision worked an even greater “sea change” \nto the “basic regulatory scheme.”  NRDC, 571 F.3d at 1266.  From the get-\ngo, the FDA’s approval of mifepristone was explicitly premised on in-person \ndispensing.  The initial 2000 approval required “[p]rovision of [the] drug \nthrough a direct, confidential physician distribution system that ensures only \nqualified physicians will receive the drug for patient dispensing.”  FDA \nApproval Memorandum to Population Council at 6.  See also id. at 4 (“[T]he \ndrug will be distributed directly to physicians.  It will not be available from \npharmacies.”).  The agency viewed this as necessary to “address[] the issue \nof physical security of the drug.”  Id.   \nSo “[t]he in-person dispensing requirement . . . was critical to FDA’s \ninitial  approval  of  mifepristone  in  2000,  which  relied  on  the  in-person \ndispensing requirement to dismiss concerns about provider qualifications, \nimproper use, illicit distribution, and detection of adverse events.”  Alliance \nfor Hippocratic Medicine v. FDA, 2023 WL 2913725, at *14 (5th Cir. Apr. 12, \n2023).  “[T]he in-person dispensing requirement was FDA’s primary tool \nfor ensuring the safe distribution and use of mifepristone.”  Id. at *15. \n“[T]his change eliminates a major safeguard against complications \nand  adverse  effects  arising  from  improper  mifepristone  use.”    Id.    It \n“significantly alters the stakes of judicial review,” triggering reopening.  \nNRDC, 571 F.3d at 1266 (quoting Sierra Club, 551 F.3d at 1025).  \nC. \n  The FDA counters that the 2016 and 2021 revisions could not have \nsignificantly altered the stakes of judicial review or made the regulatory \nscheme worth challenging in a way it wasn’t before.  After all, the FDA says, \nPlaintiffs already challenged the original 2000 approval in their 2002 petition. \n  But not all of the Plaintiffs here participated in the 2002 petition.  For \nthose Plaintiffs, the FDA’s current regime is clearly “worth challenging,” \n74 \n\nCase: 23-10362      Document: 543-1     Page: 75     Date Filed: 08/16/2023\nNo. 23-10362 \neven if the ancien régime of 2000 “may not have been” on its own.  Kennecott \nUtah Copper Corp., 88 F.3d at 1227. \n  Indeed, the FDA itself has characterized the switch from one regime \nto the other as a “sea change.”  NRDC, 571 F.3d at 1266.  Under the limited \nstay issued by a previous panel of our court, the FDA was required to return \nto the regulatory regime that existed between 2000 and 2016.  See Alliance, \n2023 WL 2913725, at *1.  The FDA vigorously protested the substitution of \nthe 2016 and 2021 regime with the original 2000 regulations.  It urged the \nSupreme Court to restore the 2016 and 2021 regulations by granting a stay of \nthe entire district court order.  Switching back to the 2000 restrictions, it \nargued, would “upend the regulatory regime for mifepristone, with sweeping \nconsequences for the pharmaceutical industry, women who need access to \nthe drug, and FDA’s ability to implement its statutory authority.”  FDA Stay \nApplication, 2023 WL 3127519, at *3.  It would “unleash[] regulatory chaos” \nfor “patients, prescribers, and the health care delivery system.”  Id. at *2, *4. \nIn sum, the FDA insisted that switching from one regime to the other \nwould “change the basic regulatory scheme.”  NRDC, 571 F.3d at 1266.  It \nclaimed that switching from the 2016/2021 scheme back to the 2000 scheme \ncounts as a sweeping change with huge stakes.  The same must be true of \nswitching from 2000 to 2016/2021—that too “upend[ed] the regulatory \nregime for mifepristone, with sweeping consequences.” \nPlaintiffs’ challenge to the 2000 approval of mifepristone is timely. \nIII.  \n  Turning to the merits, I would hold the 2000 approval unlawful.  It’s \na longstanding principle that agencies must follow their own regulations.  See \nArizona Grocery Co. v. Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Ry. Co., 284 U.S. 370, 386 \n(1932) (agency’s legislative rule “has the force of a statute”); Fort Stewart \nSchools  v.  FLRA,  495  U.S.  641,  654  (1990)  (“It  is  a  familiar  rule  of \n75 \n\nCase: 23-10362      Document: 543-1     Page: 76     Date Filed: 08/16/2023\nNo. 23-10362 \nadministrative law that an agency must abide by its own regulations.”).  The \nFDA violated that principle when it approved mifepristone under Subpart \nH—as even the drug’s sponsor, the Population Council, admitted in 2000. \nA. \nSubpart H authorizes the FDA to approve only those drugs that treat \n“serious or life-threatening illnesses.”  21 C.F.R. § 314.500.  See also 57 Fed. \nReg.  58958 (Dec. 11, 1992) (Accelerated Approval of New Drugs for Serious \nor Life-Threatening Illnesses).  It “applies to certain new drug products that \nhave been studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-\nthreatening  illnesses  and  that  provide  meaningful  therapeutic  benefit  to \npatients over existing treatments.”  21 C.F.R. § 314.500 (emphasis added). \nPregnancy is not an illness.  An “illness” is a “[b]ad or unhealthy \ncondition of the body.”  Oxford English Dictionary (2nd ed. 1989), \ns.v.  illness,  sense  3.    It’s  a  “disease,  ailment,  sickness,  malady.”    Id.  \nPregnancy,  by  contrast,  is  when  a  woman  is  “with  child.”    Oxford \nEnglish Dictionary, s.v. pregnancy, sense II.3.a. \nPregnancy is not a bad or unhealthy condition of the body—it’s a \nnatural consequence of a healthy and functioning reproductive system.  See, \ne.g., Gudenkauf v. Stauffer Communications, Inc., 922 F. Supp. 465, 473 (D. \nKan.  1996)  (“Being  the  natural  consequence  of  a  properly  functioning \nreproductive system, pregnancy cannot be called an impairment.”); Lacount \nv. South Lewis, 2017 WL 319217, at *3 (N.D. Okla. Jan. 20, 2017) (same); \nWhitaker v. Bosch Braking Sys. Div. of Robert Bosch Corp., 180 F. Supp. 2d 922, \n928 (W.D. Mich. 2001) (pregnancy is “not a serious health condition”); \nBrennan v. National Telephone Directory Corp., 850 F. Supp. 331, 343 (E.D. \nPa.  1994)  (“it  cannot  be  said  that  [a  woman’s]  reproductive  system  is \nnegatively affected” by pregnancy).   \n76 \n\nCase: 23-10362      Document: 543-1     Page: 77     Date Filed: 08/16/2023\nNo. 23-10362 \nTo be sure, pregnancy can sometimes result in illness.  Cf. Spees v. \nJames Marine, Inc., 617 F.3d 380, 397 (6th Cir. 2010) (“Pregnancy-related \nconditions have typically been found to be impairments where they are not \npart of a ‘normal’ pregnancy.”).  But that does not make the pregnancy itself \nan illness.  See Whitaker, 180 F. Supp. 2d at 929 (“pregnancy per se does not \nconstitute a serious health condition”).   \nThe same could be said about old age.  Many people become ill as they \ngrow  older.    But  growing  older  itself  is  obviously  not  an  illness.    Like \npregnancy, it’s the “natural consequence” of a healthy and functioning body.  \nIt’s entirely normal to celebrate pregnancies, just as it’s normal to celebrate \nbirthdays.  We don’t typically celebrate “bad or unhealthy conditions.” \nSo pregnancy does not qualify as a “serious or life-threatening illness” \nwithin  the  meaning  of  21  C.F.R.  § 314.500.    The  FDA  implausibly \n“determined” that it does.  FDA Approval Memorandum to Population \nCouncil at 6.  Courts do not defer to agency interpretations of unambiguous \nregulations.  See Kisor v. Wilkie, 139 S. Ct. 2400, 2415 (2019).  There’s “only \none reasonable construction” of the word “illness”—and it doesn’t include \npregnancy.  Id. \nThere is accordingly no basis for deferring to the agency.  The FDA \nsimply got it wrong.  As even the sponsor of mifepristone, the Population \nCouncil,  admitted,  “[n]either  pregnancy  nor  unwanted  pregnancy  is  an \nillness,  and  Subpart  H  is  therefore  inapplicable  for  that  reason  alone.”  \nPopulation Council Letter to FDA at 1–2.  “The plain meaning of these terms \ndoes not comprehend normal, everyday occurrences such as pregnancy and \nunwanted pregnancy.”  Id. at 2. \nB. \nThe FDA does not even try to argue that pregnancy is an “illness.”  \nInstead, the FDA, along with intervenor Danco, points out that the preamble \n77 \n\nCase: 23-10362      Document: 543-1     Page: 78     Date Filed: 08/16/2023\nNo. 23-10362 \nto  Subpart  H  uses  the  terms  “illness,”  “disease,”  and  “condition” \ninterchangeably.  See, e.g., 57 Fed. Reg. 58942, 58948 (“The drug in question \nmust be for a serious or life-threatening condition.”).  So they argue that \nSubpart  H  allows  the  FDA  to  approve  drugs  that  treat  life-threating \nconditions, as well as life-threating illnesses.  And although pregnancy is plainly \nnot an “illness,” the argument goes, pregnancy is at least a “condition.”   \nThere are two problems with this argument.  First, we do not use \npreambles to expand the meaning of clear regulatory text.  See District of \nColumbia v. Heller, 554 U.S. 570, 578 n.3 (2008) (“[I]n America ‘the settled \nprinciple of law is that the preamble cannot control the enacting part of the \nstatute in cases where the enacting part is expressed in clear, unambiguous \nterms.’”); Antonin Scalia & Bryan A. Garner, Reading Law \n218  (2012)  (“[T]he  prologue  cannot  give  words  and  phrases  of  the \ndispositive text a meaning that they cannot bear.”).  \nSecond,  this  argument—that  the  preamble  broadens  “illness”  to \ninclude “conditions”—equivocates between two distinct meanings of the \nword  “condition.”    As  used  in  the  preamble,  “condition”  means  a \n“defective  state  of  health.”    Merriam-Webster’s  Collegiate \nDictionary  (11th  ed.  2007),  s.v.  condition,  sense  4c.    In  this  sense, \n“condition”  is  a  synonym  of  “illness.”    See  Merriam-Webster’s \nCollegiate  Thesaurus  (1988),  s.v.  condition,  sense  6  (listing \n“disease,” “aliment,” and “sickness” as synonyms of “condition”). \nOf  course,  “condition”  can  also  mean  “a  state  of  being”  more \nbroadly.    Merriam-Webster’s  Collegiate  Dictionary,  s.v., \ncondition, sense 4a.  And pregnancy is certainly a “condition” in this broader \nsense. \nBut the fact that pregnancy is a “condition” in the broad sense of \n“state of being” does not make it a “condition” in the narrow sense of \n78 \n\nCase: 23-10362      Document: 543-1     Page: 79     Date Filed: 08/16/2023\nNo. 23-10362 \n“illness.”  And Subpart H plainly contemplates the narrow sense, because it \nuses “condition” interchangeably with “illness.”  A regulation about “cars” \ndoesn’t  cover  bicycles  just  because  its  preamble  sometimes  mentions \n“vehicles.”    Likewise,  a  regulation  about  “illnesses”  doesn’t  address \npregnancy just because its preamble sometimes mentions “conditions.”9 \nC. \n  The  agency’s  brief  proclaims  that  “FDA  Properly  Approved \nMifepristone Under Subpart H.”  Yet in the very next paragraph, the FDA \nturns around and denies that it used Subpart H to approve mifepristone—\nclaiming that the approval was “based on FDA’s statutory authority under \n21 U.S.C. § 355, not Subpart H.” \nAs the panel majority opinion details, Subpart H encompasses two \ndifferent paths.  The first is entitled “Approval based on a surrogate endpoint \nor on an effect on a clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible \nmorbidity.”  21 C.F.R. § 314.510 (emphasis omitted).  The second is entitled \n“Approval  with  restrictions  to  assure  safe  use.”    21  C.F.R.  § 314.520 \n(emphasis omitted).   \nMifepristone was approved under § 314.520 of Subpart H—approval \nwith restrictions.  But the FDA now suggests that § 314.520 isn’t really a \nmethod of approval at all—it’s just a method of adding restrictions on use.  \nThis argument is belied by the regulations.  The header explicitly \nrefers to this second path as a method of “[a]pproval.”  Id. § 314.520.  More \n_____________________ \n9 Danco responds by citing a Government Accountability Office report, which ob-\nserves that the FDA has used Subpart H to approve drugs for treating “breakthrough can-\ncer pain, specific symptoms of narcolepsy, and severe acne.”  GAO, Approval and \nOversight of the Drug Mifeprex at 10 (Aug. 2008).  “Severe recalcitrant nod-\nular acne” may well be a serious illness.  Id. at 44.  But that has nothing to do with whether \npregnancy is a serious or life-threatening illness. \n79 \n\nCase: 23-10362      Document: 543-1     Page: 80     Date Filed: 08/16/2023\nNo. 23-10362 \nimportantly, the regulatory text repeatedly refers to § 314.520 as a method of \ndrug  approval.    See  id.  § 314.530(a)  (“new  drugs  approved  under  . . . \n314.520”);  id.  § 314.530(b)  (“an  application  approved  under  . . . \n§ 314.520”); id. § 314.560 (“drug products approved under § 314.520”).  \nThe FDA’s argument contradicts not only the text, but also its own \nstatements over the past 23 years.  See Chenery, 318 U.S. at 95; Motor Vehicle \nMfrs. Ass’n v. State Farm, 463 U.S. 29, 50 (1983) (“[C]ourts may not accept \nappellate counsel’s post hoc rationalizations for agency action.”). \nIn its original 2000 approval memo, the FDA expressly stated that \n“[t]his  drug  is  being  approved  under  Subpart  H.”    FDA  Approval \nMemorandum to Population Council at 8.  And it has repeatedly reaffirmed \nthis view in the years since.  See FDA Supplemental Approval Letter to \nDanco Labs at 1 (June 6, 2011) (application “approved under the provisions \nof  21  CFR  314.520  (Subpart  H)”);  FDA  Letter  Denying  2002  Citizen \nPetition at 2 (Mar. 29, 2016) (“The application was approved under 21 CFR \npart 314, subpart H.”); FDA Letter Denying 2019 Citizen Petition at 2 (Dec. \n16, 2021) (same).   \nThe  GAO  report  cited  by  both  the  FDA  and  Danco  likewise \nrepeatedly describes mifepristone as having been “approved” under Subpart \nH.  GAO, Approval and Oversight of the Drug Mifeprex at \n1 (Aug. 2008) (“FDA approved the drug under a provision of the agency’s \nSubpart H regulations.”); id. at 5 (“FDA approved Mifeprex under the \nrestricted distribution provision of its Subpart H regulations.”); id. at 6 (FDA \n“approved the Mifeprex [application] under Subpart H.”).  See also id. at 10, \n14–15, 21–24, 32, 44 (same).  The report also notes that the FDA used \nSubpart H to “approve” other drugs.  See id. at 5 n.13, 25 n.46, 27 n.50, 29 \nn.53,  36  n.63.    And  it  explicitly  refers  to  § 314.520  as  an  “approval \nprovision.”  Id. at 1 n.2. \n80 \n\nCase: 23-10362      Document: 543-1     Page: 81     Date Filed: 08/16/2023\nNo. 23-10362 \nThe FDA notes that its statutory authority to approve drugs comes \nfrom 21 U.S.C. § 355.  But that doesn’t change the fact that the regulatory \npath it chose was Subpart H.  Section 355 gives the FDA the power to \napprove drugs.  And the agency exercised that power when it promulgated \nSubpart H.  The FDA did not have to adopt Subpart H in the first place.  But \nonce it did, it was bound to follow it. \nD.  \n  As a final defense, the FDA contends that subsequent events cured \nany defects in its initial 2000 approval.  Specifically, the FDA points to the \n2007 Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act and to the agency’s \n2011 Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy.  It claims that both authorities \nrender any faults with the 2000 approval irrelevant. \n  First, the FDA argues that the 2007 Act “deemed” mifepristone to \nbe approved.  But the statutory text contradicts this argument.  The Act \nmakes clear that “[a] drug that was approved before the effective date of this Act \nis . . . deemed to have in effect an approved risk evaluation and mitigation \nstrategy . . . if there are in effect on the effective date of this Act elements to \nassure safe use . . . required under [21 C.F.R. §] 314.520.”  Food and Drug \nAdministration  Amendments  Act  of  2007,  Pub.  L.  No.  110-85,  tit.  IX \n§ 909(b)(1), 121 Stat. 823, 950 (emphasis added). \nSo the Act itself did not approve any drugs.  It only approved any risk \nevaluation and mitigation strategies for those drugs that the FDA had already \nvalidly approved under § 314.520 of Subpart H.  And as explained above, the \nFDA’s attempted approval was invalid because it failed to comply with \nSubpart H.  The FDA’s reliance on the 2007 Act is entirely circular—it only \nworks  if  you  assume  that  the  agency  had  already  validly  approved \nmifepristone in the first place. \n81 \n\nCase: 23-10362      Document: 543-1     Page: 82     Date Filed: 08/16/2023\nNo. 23-10362 \nThe FDA also points to its 2011  Risk Evaluation and Mitigation \nStrategy,  arguing  that  this  too  re-approved  mifepristone  and  cured  any \ndefects in its 2000 approval.  It did not.  To the contrary, the 2011 REMS \nletter made clear that the agency continued to rely on Subpart H for its \napproval of mifepristone—that it “is approved under the provisions of 21 \nCFR 314.520 (Subpart H).”  FDA Supplemental Approval Letter to Danco \nLabs at 1.  Moreover, the letter only approved the Risk Evaluation and \nMitigation Strategy proposed in Danco’s 2008 Supplemental Application—\nit did not re-approve the drug apart from Subpart H.  In fact, the letter \nrecognized the need for continued compliance with the conditions “required \nby” Subpart H.  Id. at 2 (citing 21 C.F.R. § 314.550). \n* * *  \n  For these reasons, I would find that Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on \nthe merits of their challenge to the 2000 approval.  Plaintiffs also satisfy the \nremaining factors for equitable relief.  The harm to Plaintiffs is irreparable.  \nNo relief at law can adequately address Plaintiffs’ conscience injuries.  See \nBST Holdings, L.L.C. v. OSHA, 17 F.4th 604, 618 (5th Cir. 2021).  Nor can \nmoney damages remedy the destruction of life.  Cf. Amoco Production Co. v. \nVillage of Gambell, 480 U.S. 531, 545 (1987).  The balance of equities and \npublic interest also favor Plaintiffs.  Plaintiffs seek to vindicate the “national \npolicy of discountenancing abortion as  inimical  to  the  national  life,”  as \nreflected in Congressional enactments including the Comstock Act.  Bours v. \nUnited States, 229 F. 960, 964 (7th Cir. 1915).  See 18 U.S.C. § 1461; id. \n§ 1462.  Cf. 19 U.S.C. § 1305(a).  \nIV. \nWith respect to the FDA’s 2016 and 2021 revisions, I agree with the \nmajority’s thoughtful analysis explaining how the FDA “entirely failed to \nconsider an important aspect of the problem” in 2016 and “offered an \n82 \n\nCase: 23-10362      Document: 543-1     Page: 83     Date Filed: 08/16/2023\nNo. 23-10362 \nexplanation for its decision that runs counter to the evidence before the \nagency” in 2021.  State Farm, 463 U.S. at 43.  The agency thus acted \narbitrarily in violation of the APA. \nI write separately to add that the 2021 revisions violate the Comstock \nAct, 18 U.S.C. §§ 1461–62, and are “not in accordance with law” for that \nreason as well.  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \nA. \nThe text of the Comstock Act prohibits the mailing of abortifacient \ndrugs: \nEvery  article  or  thing  designed,  adapted,  or  intended  for \nproducing  abortion  . . .  and  [e]very  article,  instrument, \nsubstance,  drug,  medicine,  or  thing  which  is  advertised  or \ndescribed in a manner calculated to lead another to use or apply \nit for producing abortion . . . [i]s declared to be nonmailable \nmatter and shall not be conveyed in the mails or delivered from \nany post office or by any letter carrier. \nWhoever knowingly uses the mails for the mailing, carriage in \nthe mails, or delivery of anything declared by this section . . . to \nbe nonmailable . . . shall be fined under this title or imprisoned \nnot more than five years, or both, for the first such offense, and \nshall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than ten \nyears, or both, for each such offense thereafter. \n18 U.S.C. § 1461.  This language derives from the original 1873 Comstock \nAct.  See Act of Mar. 3, 1873, ch. 258, § 2, 17 Stat. 598, 599 (“No . . . article \nor thing designed or intended for the . . . procuring of abortion . . . shall be \ncarried in the mail.”). \nCongress later extended the mailing prohibition to cover common \ncarriers as well.  See Act of Feb. 8, 1897, ch. 172, 29 Stat. 512, 512 (“[I]t shall \nbe unlawful for any person to deposit with any express company or other \n83 \n\nCase: 23-10362      Document: 543-1     Page: 84     Date Filed: 08/16/2023\nNo. 23-10362 \ncommon carrier . . . any article or thing designed or intended for the . . . \nprocuring of abortion.”).  As currently in force, this provision states:  \nWhoever brings into the United States . . . or knowingly uses \nany express company or other common carrier or interactive \ncomputer  service  . . .  for  carriage  in  interstate  or  foreign \ncommerce . . . any drug, medicine, article, or thing designed, \nadapted, or intended for producing abortion . . . or [w]hoever \nknowingly takes or receives, from such express company or \nother common carrier or interactive computer service . . . any \nmatter or thing the carriage or importation of which is herein \nmade unlawful . . . [s]hall be fined under this title or imprisoned \nnot more than five years, or both, for the first such offense and \nshall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than ten \nyears, or both, for each such offense thereafter. \n18 U.S.C. § 1462. \nIn  1996,  Congress  added  “interactive  computer  service”  to  the \nComstock Act.  See Telecommunications Act of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-104, \n§ 507(a), 110 Stat. 56, 137.  So it’s also illegal to use the internet to ship or \nreceive  abortifacients.    See  18  U.S.C.  § 230(f)(2)  (defining  “interactive \ncomputer  service”);  id.  § 230(f)(3)  (“interactive  computer  service” \nincludes “the Internet”); Doe v. MySpace, Inc., 528 F.3d 413, 415 (5th Cir. \n2008) (“interactive computer service” includes “a Web site”). \n  The FDA’s 2021 Mail-Order Decision violates the Comstock Act.  \nThat  decision  authorizes  the  dispensing  of  mifepristone  “through  the \nmail . . . or through a mail-order pharmacy.”  FDA Letter to American \nCollege of Obstetricians and Gynecologists at 2 (Apr. 12, 2021).  But “us[ing] \nthe mails for the mailing” of a “drug . . . for producing abortion” is precisely \nwhat the Comstock Act prohibits.  18 U.S.C. § 1461.  See Alliance, 2023 WL \n2913725, at *20 (“[A] user of those shipping channels violates the plain text \nmerely by knowingly making use of the mail for a prohibited abortion item.”). \n84 \n\nCase: 23-10362      Document: 543-1     Page: 85     Date Filed: 08/16/2023\nNo. 23-10362 \nThe  FDA’s  2023  Risk  Evaluation  and  Mitigation  Strategy \nmodification doubles down on this violation by permanently eliminating the \nin-person dispensing requirement.  Under the 2023 REMS, pharmacies ship \nmifepristone to its users.  To become certified to distribute mifepristone, a \npharmacy must “[b]e able to ship mifepristone using a shipping service.”  \nFDA,  REMS  for  Mifepristone  at  3  (Jan.  2023).    Pharmacies  must  also \n“[t]rack and verify receipt of each shipment” and “[m]aintain records of \ndispensing and shipping.”  Id.  And distributors Danco and GenBioPro must \n“[s]hip mifepristone . . . to certified pharmacies.”  Id. at 4. \nAll  of  this  violates  the  Comstock  Act  by  “us[ing]  [an]  express \ncompany or other common carrier or interactive computer service” to ship a \n“drug . . . for producing abortion.”  18 U.S.C. § 1462(c).  See Alliance, 2023 \nWL 2913725, at *20 (“Danco has no interest in continuing to violate the law, \nwhich . . . it does every time it ships mifepristone.”); Alliance, 2023 WL \n2825871,  at  *18  (“[T]he  Comstock  Act  plainly  forecloses  mail-order \nabortion.”); Texas v. Becerra, 623 F. Supp. 3d 696, 733 (N.D. Tex. 2022) \n(“[F]ederal law bar[s] the importation or delivery of . . . medicine designed \nto produce an abortion.”) (citing 18 U.S.C. § 1461). \nB. \n  The FDA asserts various atextual considerations in an effort to avoid \nthe unambiguous meaning of the Act.  \n  First, the FDA urges that the provisions only prohibit distribution by \nUSPS and common carrier—and not by private carrier.  But that reads the \nwords “interactive computer service” out of the statute.  The Comstock Act \nforbids using “any express company or other common carrier or interactive \ncomputer service” for carriage of abortifacients.  18 U.S.C. § 1462.  As a \npractical matter, all carriers today, including private carriers, use online \nsystems for shipping items. \n85 \n\nCase: 23-10362      Document: 543-1     Page: 86     Date Filed: 08/16/2023\nNo. 23-10362 \n  Next,  the  FDA  claims  that  the  Comstock  Act  prohibits  sending \nabortifacients only when they are used in violation of state law.  To support \nthis theory, it relies on a handful of early twentieth century cases outside our \ncircuit.  See Application of the Comstock Act to the Mailing of Prescription Drugs \nThat  Can  Be  Used  for  Abortions,  46  Op.  O.L.C.  _,  _  (Dec.  23,  2022) \n(collecting cases). \nBut the earliest case it cites, Bours v. United States, 229 F. 960 (7th \nCir. 1915), rejects the FDA’s position.  Bours says that “it is immaterial what \nthe local statutory definition of abortion is, what acts of abortion are included, \nor what excluded.”  Id. at 964.  Rather, “the word ‘abortion’ in the national \nstatute must be taken in its general medical sense.”  Id.  And “[i]ts inclusion \nin the statute governing the use of the mails indicates a national policy of \ndiscountenancing abortion as inimical to the national life.”  Id.  Under Bours, \nthe  Act’s  definition  of  “abortion”  excludes  “operation[s]”  that  are \nnecessary to “save [the mother’s] life.”  Id.  But anyone who uses the mails \nto “destroy[] life” violates the statute.  Id. \n  So the FDA can’t invoke the prior-construction canon.  Under that \ncanon, legislative reenactment of a statute can, under certain conditions, \neffectively  ratify  preexisting,  authoritative  judicial  interpretation  of  that \nstatute.  But the canon requires robust judicial consensus, such as “uniform \nholdings of lower courts.”  Scalia & Garner, supra, at 324.  See, e.g., \nArmstrong v. Exceptional Child Ctr., Inc., 575 U.S. 320, 330 (2015) (quoting \nBragdon v. Abbott, 524 U.S. 624, 645 (1998)) (canon applies when “judicial \ninterpretations have settled the meaning of an existing statutory provision”) \n(emphasis added); Tex. Dep’t of Housing & Community Affairs v. Inclusive \nCommunities Project, Inc., 576 U.S. 519, 536 (2015) (“Congress accepted and \nratified  the  unanimous  holdings  of  the  Courts  of  Appeals.”)  (emphasis \nadded).  The FDA can claim no such consensus here.  To the contrary, the \ncircuits were at best split.  Bours rejects the FDA’s reading of the statute.  \n86 \n\nCase: 23-10362      Document: 543-1     Page: 87     Date Filed: 08/16/2023\nNo. 23-10362 \nAnd the amicus brief from the Ethics and Public Policy Center puts forth a \nstrong argument that no circuit court adopted the FDA’s reading. \nWhat’s more, Congress certainly knew how to prohibit only those \nabortifacients used to violate state law.  The Tariff Act of 1930, for example, \nprohibits all persons “from importing . . . any drug or medicine or any article \nwhatever  for  causing  unlawful  abortion.”    19  U.S.C.  § 1305  (emphasis \nadded).  See also Act of June 17, 1930, ch. 497, tit. III, § 305, 46 Stat. 590, 688 \n(same).    In  response,  the  FDA  suggests  that  it  would  be  irrational  for \nCongress to target all abortions in the Comstock Act, but only unlawful \nabortions in the Tariff Act.  But different Congresses can reach different \njudgments about how to regulate abortion in different contexts.  There’s \nnothing irrational about the Congress that enacted the Comstock Act in 1873 \nmaking a different judgment from the Congress that enacted the Tariff Act \ndecades later. \nMoreover, Congress has actually considered amending the Comstock \nAct  to  apply  only  to  “illegal  abortions”—and  chosen  not  to.    In  1978, \nCongress rejected a proposed Comstock Act amendment to prohibit the \nshipment of “any drug, medicine, article, or thing, with the intent that such \ndrug, medicine, article, or thing be used to produce an illegal abortion.”  H.R. \n13959, 95th Cong. § 6702(1)(C)(i) (1978) (emphasis added).  See also id. \n§ 6701(a)(2) (same).  A contemporaneous Congressional report explained: \n[R]evised title 18 changes current law by requiring proof that the \nrelevant material or object to be used to produce an illegal \nabortion  and  that  the  offender  specifically  intended  the \nmaterial object to be so used. . . . [A]n abortion is “illegal” if it \nis contrary to the law of the state in which the abortion is \nperformed. \nReport of the Subcommittee on Criminal Justice on Recodification of Federal \nCriminal Law, H.R. Rep. No. 95-29, pt. 3, at 42 (1978) (emphasis added). \n87 \n\nCase: 23-10362      Document: 543-1     Page: 88     Date Filed: 08/16/2023\nNo. 23-10362 \nCongress also had the opportunity to remove “abortion” from the \nComstock Act altogether.  See Comstock Cleanup Act of 1996, H.R. 3057, \n104th Cong. (1996).  See also 142 Cong. Rec. 24313, 24313 (Sep. 24, 1996) \n(statement of Rep. Pat Schroeder, sponsor of H.R. 3057) (“[T]he Comstock \nAct has never been repealed; it is still on the books.”); id. at 24313–14 \n(“[T]his body just allowed the Comstock Act to be enforced on the Internet \nvis-à-vis anything doing with abortion. . . . The Telecommunications Act \npassed this year extended the Comstock Act’s prohibitions to anyone who \nuses an interactive computer service.”).  But again, Congress declined to \nremove “abortion” from the statute.  To the contrary, it chose to repeal only \nthe Act’s prohibition on the shipment of contraceptives.  See Pub. L. No. 91-\n662, §§ 3–4, 84 Stat. 1973, 1973 (1971). \n  So if the FDA wants us to look to the post-enactment history of the \nComstock Act rather than its text, that history only reinforces the natural \nreading of the text.  I would set aside the 2021 Mail-Order Decision because \nit violates the Comstock Act. \nV. \nIn this appeal, neither the FDA nor Danco is content to simply argue \nthat the district court erred.  They disparage the ruling as “an unprecedented \njudicial assault on a careful regulatory process.”  The “non-expert” district \ncourt  issued  an  “unprecedented  order  countermanding  the  scientific \njudgment of the Food and Drug Administration.” \nTheir message is simple:  The scientists at the FDA can do no wrong.  \nSo courts have no business reviewing their actions. \nThat’s mistaken on multiple levels.   \nTo begin with, Congress has directed the judiciary to review the \nlegality of regulatory action by the FDA, no less than with other agencies.  \n88 \n\nCase: 23-10362      Document: 543-1     Page: 89     Date Filed: 08/16/2023\nNo. 23-10362 \nCongress could have exempted the FDA generally—or its approval of drugs \nspecifically—from APA review.  See 5 U.S.C. § 701(a)(1) (no APA review \nwhere  “statutes  preclude  judicial  review”).    But  it  didn’t—and  for \nunderstandable reasons. \nScientists have contributed an enormous amount to improving our \nlives.  But scientists are human beings just like the rest of us.  They’re not \nperfect.  See, e.g., Whole Woman’s Health v. Paxton, 10 F.4th 430, 464–70 (5th \nCir. 2021) (en banc) (Ho, J., concurring).  None of us are.  We all make \nmistakes. \nAnd the FDA has made plenty.  Several of the FDA’s past mistakes \nare detailed in the amicus briefs from the United States Medical Association \nand  the  Association  of  American  Physicians  and  Surgeons  Educational \nFoundation.  I’ll highlight just a few examples here. \nEarlier this year, the FDA was forced to pull the drug Makena from \nthe market.  See FDA News Release: FDA Commissioner and Chief Scientist \nAnnounce Decision to Withdraw Approval of Makena (Apr. 6, 2023).  The FDA \nhad approved this drug in 2011 to treat premature birth, using Subpart H.  See \nFrank J. Sasinowski & Alexander J. Varond, FDA’s Flexibility in Subpart H \nApprovals: Assessing Quantum of Effectiveness Evidence, 71 Food & Drug \nL.J. 135, 167 (2016).  Yet the drug turned out to have “no benefit for mothers \nor babies.”  Christina Jewett, Preterm Birth Drug Withdrawn After 12 Years, \nN.Y. Times (Mar. 7, 2023).  As one headline put it, “F.D.A. Rushed a \nDrug for Preterm Births.  Did it Put Speed Over Science?”  Christina Jewett, \nN.Y.  Times  (Mar.  25,  2022).    “Makena  is  another  example  . . .  of  a \nmedication  fast-tracked  by  the  [FDA]  onto  the  market  even  though \nconsiderable  doubt  remained  about  whether  it  worked.”    Id.    (Makena \ninvolved the other Subpart H approval pathway—approval with a surrogate \nendpoint, not approval with restrictions.  But an agency that relies on bad \n89 \n\nCase: 23-10362      Document: 543-1     Page: 90     Date Filed: 08/16/2023\nNo. 23-10362 \nscience for approval under one Subpart H pathway can surely do so under the \nother as well.) \nThe FDA hasn’t just approved ineffective drugs—it’s also approved \nharmful drugs.  In 1941, for example, it approved DES for use by pregnant \nwomen to treat certain postpartum conditions.  Several years later, the FDA \napproved it to prevent miscarriages as well.  The FDA’s approval has since \nbeen called a “tragedy.”  Jessica Dye, FDA Outlines Initiatives Inspired by \nDES  ‘Tragedy’,  Law360  (Feb.  24,  2011).    “Even  before  the  [FDA] \napproved the drug in 1941, researchers knew that DES caused cancer and \nproblems with sexual development in laboratory animals.”  Nancy Langston, \nThe Retreat from Precaution: Regulating Diethylstilbestrol (DES), Endocrine \nDisruptors, and Environmental Health, 13 Environmental History 41, \n42 (2008).  “These concerns initially led [the] FDA Commissioner . . . to \nreject the drug.”  Id.  But “by 1947, the FDA had abandoned its position of \nprecaution.”  Id. \nOnly in 2000 did FDA finally and formally “withdraw[] approval” of \nDES—nearly six decades after it approved the drug.  65 Fed. Reg. 55264 \n(“Withdrawal of Approval of 28 New Drug Applications”).  DES turned out \nto be a carcinogen.  See Diethylstilbestrol (DES) Exposure and Cancer, Nat’l \nCancer Inst. (Dec. 20, 2021).  It also significantly increases the odds of \ninfertility, miscarriage, stillbirth, and neonatal death.  See id. \n  The  FDA  has  been  blamed  for  contributing  to  the  opioid  crisis.  \nOpioid overdose was “once rare” in the United States.  Andrew Kolodny, \nHow FDA Failures Contributed to the Opioid Crisis, 22 AMA J. Ethics 743, \n743 (2020).  But now “the vast oversupply of opioid drugs in the United \nStates has caused a plague.”  In re Nat’l Prescription Opiate Litigation, 927 \nF.3d 919, 924 (6th Cir. 2019) (approvingly quoting the district court).  As one \nnoted scholar observed in the AMA Journal of Ethics, “[t]he FDA did not \n90 \n\nCase: 23-10362      Document: 543-1     Page: 91     Date Filed: 08/16/2023\nNo. 23-10362 \nproperly  enforce  the  Food,  Drug,  and  Cosmetic  Act  when  it  approved \nPurdue Pharma’s new drug application for extended-release (ER) oxycodone \nin 1995.”  Kolodny, supra, at 744.  And “despite mounting evidence that a \nsurge  in  opioid  consumption  was  resulting  in  adverse  public  health \nconsequences, the FDA continued to approve new opioid formulations for \nchronic pain based on efficacy trials utilizing a controversial methodology.”  \nId. at 745.  It wasn’t just that the studies were bad—the FDA suffered from \nregulatory capture by the pharmaceutical industry, which pursued its own \ninterest rather than the interest of the American people.  See id. at 745–46. \nFinally, consider this statistic from the Journal of the American Medical \nAssociation:  Of all the novel therapeutics approved by the FDA in the decade \nfollowing its approval of mifepristone, nearly one-third experienced safety \nissues.  See Nicholas S. Downing et al., Postmarket Safety Events Among Novel \nTherapeutics Approved by the US Food and Drug Administration Between 2001 \nand 2010, 317 J. Am. Med. Ass’n 1854, 1854 (2017). \n  Problems at the FDA have not escaped Congress’s attention.  Just last \nyear, the chair of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions criticized the FDA for its “unacceptable, longstanding” food safety \nfailures.    Letter  of  Senator  Patty  Murray,  Chair,  Senate  Committee  on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions to FDA Commissioner (Apr. 11, \n2022).  As she put it, “[t]he FDA’s failure over decades to regulate and \nenforce food safety standards . . . has put the health of Americans at risk.”  \nId. \nSo it’s not surprising that our court is far from the first to identify \nproblems with FDA action sufficient to necessitate judicial intervention.  \nCourts have held a number of FDA actions unlawful under the APA—\nincluding drug approval.  See, e.g., Am. Bioscience, Inc. v. Thompson, 269 F.3d \n1077, 1078 (D.C. Cir. 2001) (“Appellant argues that the [FDA’] decision to \n91 \n\nCase: 23-10362      Document: 543-1     Page: 92     Date Filed: 08/16/2023\nNo. 23-10362 \napprove . . . [an] Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) for a generic \nversion  .  .  .  was  arbitrary  and  capricious.    We  agree  and  vacate  that \napproval.”).  See also, e.g., R.J. Reynolds Vapor Co. v. FDA, 65 F.4th 182, 191 \n(5th Cir. 2023) (FDA’s “‘unexplained’ and ‘inconsistent’ positions are \nlikely arbitrary and capricious.”); Genus Medical Technologies, LLC v. FDA, \n994 F.3d 631, 644 (D.C. Cir. 2021) (“FDA’s decision must be set aside \nbecause  it  was  based  on  an  erroneous  interpretation  of  law.”);  Teva \nPharmaceuticals,  Inc.  v.  Sebelius,  595  F.3d  1303,  1318  (D.C.  Cir.  2010) \n(rejecting “the interpretation of the statute that the FDA has adopted in two \nrecent adjudications”); Teva Pharmaceuticals, Inc. v. FDA, 441 F.3d 1, 5 (D.C. \nCir.  2006)  (“This  error  renders  [the  FDA’s]  decision  arbitrary  and \ncapricious.”); Purepac Pharmaceutical Co. v. Thompson, 354 F.3d 877, 883–84 \n(D.C. Cir. 2004) (“FDA’s conclusion . . . was arbitrary and capricious.”); \nTeva Pharmaceuticals, Inc. v. FDA, 182 F.3d 1003, 1007 (D.C. Cir. 1999) \n(“FDA’s response was arbitrary and capricious.”); Zotos International, Inc. \nv. Young, 830 F.2d 350, 354 (D.C. Cir. 1987) (“FDA’s decision was arbitrary \nand capricious.”); Rhodia, Inc. v. FDA, 608 F.2d 1376, 1376 (D.C. Cir. 1979) \n(“Finding the action arbitrary and capricious, we set aside the FDA order.”); \nNatural Nutritional Foods Ass’n v. Mathews, 557 F.2d 325, 333 (2nd Cir. 1977) \n(“[T]he FDA’s holding in this case was arbitrary and capricious and not in \naccordance with law.”). \nSo it’s simply wrong to claim—as the FDA and Danco and their \nsupporting amici here have claimed—that the district court’s decision in this \ncase was unprecedented. \nThe scientists at the FDA deserve our respect and our gratitude, but \nnot our blind deference.  That would defy Congress’s clear directive that \ncourts conduct independent legal review of FDA action under the APA. \n92 \n\nCase: 23-10362      Document: 543-1     Page: 93     Date Filed: 08/16/2023\nNo. 23-10362 \n* * * \nBy  the  applicant’s  own  admission,  the  FDA  used  an  unlawful \nprocedure when it approved mifepristone.  And the agency’s later regulations \nare likewise invalid—both under the APA as the majority outlines, and under \nthe Comstock Act as well.  In sum, the regulations are “not in accordance \nwith law” and therefore must be set aside.  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \nAccordingly, we should affirm.  I concur in part and dissent in part. \n93 ",

Women face severe, even life-threatening, harm because the federal \ngovernment has disregarded their health and safety. \n2.  Defendant U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has the statutory \nresponsibility to protect the health, safety, and welfare of all Americans by putting \ncommonsense safeguards on high-risk drugs. \n1 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z     Document 217     Filed 01/16/25      Page 2 of 199     PageID 12234\n3.  But the FDA has failed in this responsibility by removing many of the \nsafety standards it once provided to women using abortion drugs.  \n4.  Abortion  drugs  are  dangerous—the  FDA’s  own  label  says  that  an \nestimated roughly one in 25 women who take abortion drugs will visit the emergency \nroom.  \n5.  But  the  FDA  has  enabled  online  abortion  providers  to  mail  FDA-\napproved  abortion  drugs  to  women  in  states  that  regulate abortion—dispensing \nabortion drugs with no doctor care, no exam, and no in-person follow-up care. These \ndangerous drugs are now flooding states like Missouri and Idaho and sending women \nin these States to the emergency room.  \n       \nWomen prepare in-home abortion kits at a ‘pill-packing party’ at the MAP’s offices; \nPatient  packages  include  two  abortion  medications,  instructions  and  additional \ninformation.1 \n6.  Women face severe bleeding, ruptured ectopic pregnancies, and life-\nthreatening  infections  because  the  FDA  recklessly  removed  in-person  safety \nstandards that it once provided. \n7.  Women should have the in-person care of a doctor when taking high-risk \ndrugs. The States of Missouri, Kansas, and Idaho thus challenge the FDA’s actions \n                                            \n1 Ex. 1, Scott Calvert, The Parties Where Volunteers Pack Abortion Pills for Red-State \nWomen, Wall Street Journal (Aug. 12, 2024), https://www.wsj.com/us-news/abortion-\npill-parties-shipping-148e3c15.  \n2 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z     Document 217     Filed 01/16/25      Page 3 of 199     PageID 12235\nto remove commonsense safety measures for abortion drugs and ask that the Court \nhold these actions unlawful, stay their effective date, set them aside, and vacate \nthem.  \n8.  In rolling back safeguard after safeguard, the FDA has turned a blind \neye to the known harms of abortion drugs to the detriment of women and girls.  \n9.  The FDA has taken the following agency actions that harm women and \ngirls: (1) the 2016 rollback of most of the safety precautions that the FDA had put in \nplace when it approved mifepristone in 2000, including three in-person doctor visits \nand limits to ensure these drugs were not taken later in pregnancy; (2) the 2019 \napproval of a single, shared system Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) \nfor  the  brand  and  generic  versions  of  mifepristone;  and  (3)  the  2021  and  2023 \ndecisions  to  allow  these  drugs  to  be  sent  by  mail  and  dispensed  online  or  at \npharmacies. \n10.  In March 2016, the FDA made “interrelated,” “major changes” to the \nabortion drug regimen but failed to explain why it was unnecessary to consider any \nstudy that evaluated the cumulative effects of the changes as a whole. \n11.  Major  changes  that  occurred  in  2016  included  (1)  extending  the \npermissible gestational age of the baby from seven weeks to ten weeks; (2) reducing \nthe number of required in-person office visits from three to one; and (3) expanding \nwho could prescribe and administer abortion drugs beyond medical doctors.  \n12.  Each of these regimen changes carries its own risks. And combining \nthem only increases those risks. For example, numerous studies show that there are \nincreased risks from abortion drugs to pregnant women as the baby’s age advances \nfrom seven to ten weeks, due in part to significant growth of the placenta and the \nbaby during that period. The risks of harm to women are also exacerbated without \nfollow-up visits, during which a doctor can assess whether a mother is suffering \ncomplications from the older gestational age of her baby. \n3 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z     Document 217     Filed 01/16/25      Page 4 of 199     PageID 12236\n13.  But  despite  the  FDA  itself  characterizing  these  changes  as \n“interrelated,” the FDA made them without any studies that evaluated the impact of \nremoving all of these interrelated safeguards at once.  \n14.  On  top  of  removing these  safeguards,  the  FDA also  eliminated  the \nsafeguard under which abortion providers must report non-fatal complications. But \nthis elimination was based on past data collected under the originally approved safety \nstandards, not the new deregulated regime. This was unreasonable. \n15.  In 2016, the agency also ignored the potential impacts that the removal \nof  commonsense  safeguards  would  have  on  adolescent  girls,  a  violation  of  the \nPediatric Research and Equity Act (PREA). It improperly relied on extrapolation in \nlieu  of  any  safety  assessment  of  the  new  regimen’s  safety  and  effectiveness  on \npediatric populations. And the FDA needed to classify pregnancy as a “disease” to \navoid such a safety assessment. But pregnancy is not a disease. \n16.  In addition, the studies on which the FDA did rely included safety \nmeasures like ultrasound screenings and follow-up visits that were stripped from the \nnew regimen. \n17.  The  FDA’s  major  changes  failed  to  satisfy  the  rigorous  scientific \nstandards of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) and violated PREA’s \nrequirement for a specific safety assessment of these changes on pregnant girls who \nundergo the revised regime. \n18.  In 2019, several organizations filed a citizen petition challenging the \n2016 changes and asserting that the agency violated the law by ignoring the growing \nand substantial evidence that these high-risk drugs harm women. All. for Hippocratic \nMed. v. U.S. Food & Drug Admin., 78 F.4th 210, 226 (5th Cir. 2023), rev’d, 602 U.S. \n367 (2024) (AHM).  \n19.  One month later, the FDA approved a generic version of Mifeprex based \non the flawed and unlawful 2016 Major Changes. \n4 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z     Document 217     Filed 01/16/25      Page 5 of 199     PageID 12237\n20.  When the FDA approved generic mifepristone, it also approved a single, \nshared  system  risk  evaluation and  mitigation  strategy  (REMS)  for  mifepristone \nproducts for “the medical termination of intrauterine pregnancy” through 70 days \n(known as the “Mifepristone REMS Program”). \n21.  In April 2021, the FDA, under new management installed by the Biden-\nHarris Administration, issued a “Non-Enforcement Decision” under which the agency \nwould not enforce the in-person dispensing protection but instead would temporarily \nallow abortion drugs to be shipped by mail during the COVID-19 public health \nemergency despite a statute expressly disallowing that conduct. 18 U.S.C. § 1461.  \n22.  In December 2021, the FDA rejected almost all the relief sought in the \ncitizen petition and, on the same day, the Biden-Harris FDA announced that it would \npermanently allow abortion providers to send abortion drugs through the mail, in \nblatant violation of statutory law. 18 U.S.C. § 1461. \n23.  And in 2023, the FDA formalized its 2021 removal of the in-person \ndispensing  protection  and  expanded  the  program  to  allow  mifepristone  to  be \ndispensed by retail pharmacies. The agency relied on the same basis for its 2021 \ndecision, adding only that it had not observed a significant difference in adverse event \nreporting during the COVID-19 public health emergency. \n24.  The FDA’s decision to eliminate the in-person dispensing protection \nfailed to account for or address the federal laws that prohibit the distribution of \nabortion drugs by postal mail, express company, or common carrier and by interactive \ncomputer service. See 18 U.S.C. §§ 1461, 1462. Instead, through its words and actions \nFDA permitted and sometimes even encouraged these illegal activities. But a federal \nagency cannot authorize unlawful actions. FCC v. Next Wave Pers. Commc’ns Inc., \n537 U.S. 293, 300 (2003) (“The Administrative Procedure Act requires federal courts \nto set aside federal agency action that is ‘not in accordance with law,’ 5 U.S.C. \n5 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z     Document 217     Filed 01/16/25      Page 6 of 199     PageID 12238\n§ 706(2)(A)—which means, of course, any law, and not merely those laws that the \nagency itself is charged with administering.”) (citation omitted). \n25.  The FDA has consistently identified emergency medical care—including \nState emergency medical care—as the backstop for abortion drug complications. Its \ncurrent label directs women to emergency rooms if one of many adverse complications \narise. \n26.  The FDA has acted unlawfully. Now, the State Plaintiffs ask the Court \nto protect women by holding unlawful, staying the effective date of, setting aside, and \nvacating the FDA’s actions to eviscerate crucial safeguards for those who undergo \nthis dangerous drug regimen. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n27.  This  Court  has  subject-matter  jurisdiction  under  28  U.S.C.  §  1331 \nbecause this action raises federal questions under the Administrative Procedure Act \n(APA), 5 U.S.C. §§ 553, 701-06, and the FDCA, 21 U.S.C. § 301 et seq. \n28.   This Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1346(a) because this is a \ncivil action against the United States. \n29.  This Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1361 because this lawsuit \nis an action to compel an officer of the United States or any federal agency to perform \nhis or her duty. \n30.  This Court has jurisdiction to review Defendants’ unlawful actions and \nenter appropriate relief under the APA, 5 U.S.C. §§ 553, 701–06. \n31.  This  Court  has  jurisdiction  to  issue  equitable  relief  necessary  and \nappropriate to enjoin ultra vires agency action under an equitable cause of action. \nLarson v. Domestic & Foreign Com. Corp., 337 U.S. 682, 689–91 (1949). \n6 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z     Document 217     Filed 01/16/25      Page 7 of 199     PageID 12239\n32.  This lawsuit seeks declaratory, injunctive, and other appropriate relief \nunder the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201–02, 5 U.S.C. §§ 705–06, \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 57, and this Court’s inherent equitable powers. \n33.  This Court may award costs and attorneys’ fees to Plaintiffs under the \nEqual Access to Justice Act, 28 U.S.C. § 2412. \n34.  Venue properly lies in this Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391 because \na substantial part of the facts, events or omissions giving rise to the claims occurred \nin this district.  \n35.  Plaintiff States brought this intervention action in the same district and \ndivision in which an action involving the same subject matter is already pending. \n36.  Defendants are United States officers or agencies sued in their official \ncapacities.  \n37.  Therefore,  this  Court  has  personal  jurisdiction  over  Defendants  for \npurposes of this action because their immunity has been abrogated by 5 U.S.C. § 702, \nand  they  have  “submit[ted]”  to  such  jurisdiction  “through  contact  with  and” \nregulatory  “activity  directed  at”  Plaintiff  States  and  their  respective  medical \nproviders and health plans.

This action challenges the FDA’s failure to abide by its legal obligations \nto  protect  the  health,  safety,  and  welfare  of  women  and  girls  and  comply  with \nstatutory  law  when  eliminating  necessary  safeguards  for  pregnant  women  who \nundergo the high-risk abortion drug regimen of mifepristone and misoprostol.  \n51.  The FDA no longer even requires an in-person visit to protect women’s \nhealth and well-being when taking abortion drugs.  \n9 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z     Document 217     Filed 01/16/25      Page 10 of 199     PageID 12242\n52.  Abortion drugs are high-risk. Endocrine disrupters such as mifepristone \ncould  have  significant  impacts  on  an  adolescent  girl’s  developing  body  and \nreproductive system. Despite this fact, the FDA failed to require an assessment that \nevaluated the safety of the 2016 Major Changes on pregnant girls under 18 years of \nage. \n53.  The FDA has also eliminated the few safeguards it initially established \nto protect women who receive mifepristone. \n54.  In 2016, the FDA made changes (1) allowing pregnant women and girls \nto take the drug at up to 70 days’ gestation rather than only 49 days’ gestation; (2) \nallowing  non-doctors  to  prescribe  and  administer  chemical  abortions;  and  (3) \neliminating  crucial  in-person  follow-up  office  visits  to  check  women  for  life-\nthreatening complications after taking high-risk abortion drugs.  \n55.  The agency also eliminated the safeguard under which prescribers must \nreport nonfatal adverse events from chemical abortion based on past data collected \nwhen original standards were still in place. This last change meant that the FDA and \nthe public would never learn how many more happened due to the removal of the \nprior safeguards.  \n56.  These changes were not only “major” but “interrelated.”2 Yet the FDA \nnever  explained  why  no  study  it  relied  on  to  make  the  changes  assessed  their \ncollective impact on the safety and effectiveness of the drug. \n57.  Then,  in  2021,  the  FDA  announced  that  abortion  providers  could \ndispense  abortion  drugs  by  mail  or  mail-order  pharmacy,  despite  longstanding \nfederal law prohibiting mailing abortion drugs.  \n                                            \n2  Ex.  2,  FDA,  Center  for  Drug  Evaluation  and  Research,  Summary  Review  of \nApplication Number: 020687Orig1s020 (Mar. 29, 2016) (2016 Summary Review). \n10 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z     Document 217     Filed 01/16/25      Page 11 of 199     PageID 12243\n58.  In  2023,  the  FDA  formalized  its  decision  to  remove  any  in-person \ndispensing protection and to permit abortion providers to prescribe abortion drugs \nwithout an initial office visit or confirming that a woman does not have a life-\nthreatening complication, such as an ectopic pregnancy, that would preclude her from \ntaking abortion drugs. \n59.  The FDA relied on the same basis for its 2023 decision as its 2021 \ndecision but added that “[t]he number of adverse events reported to FDA during the \nCOVID-19 PHE with mifepristone use for medical termination of pregnancy is small, \nand the data provide no indication that any program deviation or noncompliance with \nthe Mifepristone REMS Program contributed to these reported adverse events.”3 It \nalso noted that the format of the REMS document would not be changed “[t]o avoid \nthe misperception that this REMS modification is making major changes to the \nREMS document that go beyond our December 16, 2021, determination that the \nREMS must be modified to remove the in-person dispensing protection and add \npharmacy  certification,”  and  that  the  “[c]hanges  are  in  line  with  the  REMS \nModification Notification letters sent December 16, 2021.”4 \nII. The Harms of Abortion Drugs  \n60.  A chemical abortion requires administering two drugs: (1) mifepristone \n(also called “Mifeprex” and “RU-486”) and (2) misoprostol.  \n61.  Mifepristone is a synthetic steroid and endocrine disruptor that blocks \nprogesterone  receptors  in  the  uterus.  Progesterone  is  necessary  for  the  healthy \ngrowth of a baby in utero and the maintenance of a pregnancy. When a woman ingests \nmifepristone,  it  blocks  her  natural  progesterone,  chemically  destroys  the  baby’s \n                                            \n3 Ex. 3, FDA, Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, Mifepristone Summary \nReview, dated Jan. 3, 2023 at 21 (FDA 2023 Summary Review). \n4 Id. at 8–9, 16. \n11 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z     Document 217     Filed 01/16/25      Page 12 of 199     PageID 12244\nuterine environment, prevents the baby from receiving nutrition, and ultimately \nstarves the baby to death in the womb. \n62.  The second drug, misoprostol, induces cramping and contractions to \nexpel the baby from the mother’s womb. \n63.  Women who take abortion drugs experience many intense side effects, \nincluding cramping and heavy bleeding.5 \n64.  The use of these two drugs can cause significant injuries and harms to \npregnant women, and studies of the real-world use of mifepristone concluded that \nsignificant morbidity and mortality have occurred following the use of mifepristone \nas an abortifacient.6  \n65.  For example, the FDA’s own label states that roughly one in 25 women \nwho take abortion drugs will end up in the emergency room, with up to 7 percent \nrequiring a “surgical procedure because the pregnancy did not completely pass from \nthe uterus or to stop bleeding.”7  \n66.  Of those women who end up in the emergency room after taking abortion \ndrugs, many suffer severe injuries. A recent study testing the severity of emergency \ndepartment visits for Medicaid-eligible women following various pregnancy outcomes \nfound  that  “an  [emergency  department]  visit  following  a  chemical abortion  was \nsignificantly more likely to have a severe or critical acuity rating than a visit following \nsurgical abortion, live birth, or an ED visit at any time by a woman who was never \n                                            \n5 Ex. 4, Harrison Compl.

Many women also do not understand the nature of chemical abortion or \nthe risks associated with taking abortion drugs, resulting in an increase in the \nfrequency  of  women  seeking  emergency  medical  care  for  side  effects  such  as \ncramping, heavy bleeding, and severe pain even if they are not suffering an adverse \nevent.10 \n68.  The complications of abortion drugs increase as the baby’s gestational \nage increases. One study found that, after nine weeks’ gestation, almost four times \nas many women and girls experience an incomplete abortion, nearly twice as many \nsuffer an infection, and over six times as many women and girls require surgical \nabortion after consuming the abortion drugs than at before nine weeks gestation.11 \nThe FDA’s own label notes that the percentage of surgical interventions for ongoing \npregnancy is just over ten times higher for women at 64–70 days gestation than for \nwomen at less than or equal to 49 days gestation.12 \n                                            \n8  James  Studnicki  et  al.,  Comparative  Acuity  of  Emergency  Department  Visits \nFollowing Pregnancy Outcomes Among Medicaid Eligible Women, 2004-2015, Int’l J. \nEpidemiology & Pub.

Abortion drugs present heightened risks for women with an Rh-negative \nblood type. If these women are not administered Rhogam at the time of their chemical \nabortion, they may experience isoimmunization, which threatens their ability to have \nfuture successful pregnancies. If an Rh-negative woman is left untreated, her future \nbaby will have a fourteen percent (14%) chance of being stillborn and a fifty percent \n(50%) chance of suffering neonatal death or a brain injury. Around fifteen percent \n(15%) of the U.S. population has this blood type.15 \n                                            \n14  Endowment  for  Human  Development,  I  am  Pointing, \nhttps://www.ehd.org/gallery/424/I-am-Pointing%21.  \n15 See Ex. 9, Am.

Without any in-person examination, abortion providers can misdate the \ngestational  age  of  a  baby  or  fail  to  detect  an  ectopic  pregnancy,  with  serious \nconsequences. It is undisputed that an ultrasound is the most accurate method to \ndetermine gestational age and identify ectopic pregnancy.16 \n73.  Some abortion activists encourage women to lie to emergency room staff \nby saying they are having a miscarriage if they suffer complications requiring urgent \ncare.17 \n74.  The  risk  of  chemical  abortions  is  not  only  physical:  women  have \ndescribed that their chemical abortion experiences harmed their mental health and \nleft them feeling unprepared, silenced, regretful, or left with no other choice.18  \n75.  Some abortion providers exacerbate this mental health harm by failing \nto inform a woman what she will see when she self-administers abortion drugs at \nhome. For example, one woman was surprised and saddened to see that her aborted \n                                            \n16 Ex. 10, Am.

The FDA must also reject an application if “the results of such tests show \nthat such drug is unsafe for use under such conditions or do not show that such drug \nis safe for use under such conditions.” 21 U.S.C. § 355(d); 21 C.F.R. § 314.125(b)(3). \n81.  The  FDA  must  refuse  an  application  if  the  FDA  “has  insufficient \ninformation to determine whether such drug is safe for use under such conditions.” \n21 U.S.C. § 355(d); 21 C.F.R. § 314.125(b)(4). \n82.  Finally,  the  FDA  must  deny  an  application  if  “there  is  a  lack  of \nsubstantial  evidence  that  the  [new]  drug  will  have  the  effect  it  purports  or  is \nrepresented  to  have  under  the  conditions  of  use  prescribed,  recommended,  or \nsuggested  in  the  proposed  labeling  thereof.”  21  U.S.C.  §  355(d);  21  C.F.R. \n§ 314.125(b)(5). \n83.  “Substantial evidence” is “evidence consisting of adequate and well-\ncontrolled investigations, including clinical investigations, by experts qualified by \nscientific training and experience to evaluate the effectiveness of the drug involved, \non the basis of which it could fairly and responsibly be concluded by such experts that \nthe drug will have the effect it purports or is represented to have under the conditions \nof use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the labeling or proposed labeling \nthereof.” 21 U.S.C. § 355(d). \n84.  If a sponsor of an approved drug subsequently seeks to change the \nlabeling,  market  a  new  dosage  or  strength  of  the  drug,  or  change  the  way  it \nmanufactures a drug, the company must submit a supplemental new drug application \n(sNDA) seeking the FDA’s approval of such changes. 21 U.S.C. § 355(b); 21 C.F.R. \n§§ 314.54, 314.70. \n85.  “All  procedures  and  actions  that  apply  to  an  application  under  [21 \nC.F.R.] § 314.50 also apply to supplements, except that the information required in \n18 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z     Document 217     Filed 01/16/25      Page 19 of 199     PageID 12251\nthe supplement is limited to that needed to support the change.” 21 C.F.R.§ 314.71(b); \nsee also 21 C.F.R. § 314.54(a) (“application need contain only that information needed \nto support the modification(s) of the listed drug”). \n86.  The sNDA must also show that the drug is safe and effective for “the \nconditions of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the proposed labeling.” \n21 U.S.C. § 355(d). \n87.  A generic drug manufacturer may submit an abbreviated new drug \napplication (ANDA) to introduce into commerce and to distribute a generic version of \nan approved drug. 21 U.S.C. § 355(j). \n88.  In the ANDA, the generic drug manufacturer must show, among other \nthings, that (a) the conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the \nlabeling proposed for the new drug have been previously approved for a drug listed \nand (b) the drug product is chemically identical to the approved drug, allowing it to \nrely  on  the  FDA’s  previous  finding  of  safety  and  effectiveness.  The  route  of \nadministration,  dosage  form,  and  strength  for  the  generic  also  identical  to  the \napproved drug. 21 U.S.C. § 355(j); 21 C.F.R. § 314.94. \nB.  Assessments on Pediatric Populations. \n89.  PREA  was  enacted  in  2003  to  require  studies  on  the  safety  and \neffectiveness of drugs intended for pediatric populations, unless certain exceptions \napply. The FDA may require an assessment on the drug’s safety and effectiveness, \nextrapolate findings from studies on adult populations, or waive the assessment for \npediatric populations. 21 U.S.C. § 355c. \n90.  In  general,  PREA requires  a  drug  application  or  supplement  to  an \napplication  to  include  a  safety  and  effectiveness  assessment  for  the  claimed \nindications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations. 21 U.S.C. § 355c(a)(2)(A)(i). This \n19 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z     Document 217     Filed 01/16/25      Page 20 of 199     PageID 12252\nassessment  must  also  support  dosing  and  administration  for  each  pediatric \nsubpopulation for which the drug is safe and effective. 21 U.S.C. § 355c(a)(2)(A)(ii). \n91.  Under  limited  circumstances,  PREA  allows  the  FDA  to  avoid  this \nassessment  and,  instead,  extrapolate  the  safety  and  effectiveness  of  a  drug  for \npediatric populations: “If the course of the disease and the effects of the drug are \nsufficiently similar in adults and pediatric patients, the [FDA] may conclude that \npediatric effectiveness can be extrapolated from adequate and well-controlled studies \nin  adults,  usually  supplemented  with  other  information  obtained  in  pediatric \npatients.” 21 U.S.C. § 355c(a)(2)(B)(i) (emphasis added). \n92.  But  to  support  this  extrapolation,  the  FDA  must  include  “brief \ndocumentation of the scientific data supporting the conclusion” that the course of the \n“disease” and the effects of the drug are sufficiently similar in adults and pediatric \npatients. 21 U.S.C. § 355c(a)(2)(B)(iii) (emphasis added). \nC.  Subpart H Regulations for Accelerated Approval of Certain New \nDrugs for Serious and Life-Threatening Illnesses. \n93.  Originally, abortion drugs were subject to a safety regimen commonly \nreferred to as Subpart H. Subpart H allowed the FDA to accelerate approval of drugs \nfor serious and life-threatening illnesses and authorized the FDA to require post-\napproval studies and distribution limitations. \nD.  Drugs Approved with Previous Subpart H Restrictions Deemed \nto have REMS. \n94.  In 2007, Congress codified Subpart H. 21 U.S.C. § 355-1. The Food and \nDrug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 (FDAAA) authorized the FDA to \nrequire persons submitting certain new drug applications to submit and implement \na risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) if the FDA determines that a \nREMS is “necessary to ensure that the benefits of a drug outweigh the risks of the \ndrug.” 21 U.S.C. § 355-1(a). \n20 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z     Document 217     Filed 01/16/25      Page 21 of 199     PageID 12253\n95.  Section 909(b)(1) of the FDAAA specified that a “drug that was approved \nbefore the effective date of this Act is . . . deemed to have in effect an approved [REMS] \n. . . if there are in effect on the effective date of this Act elements to assure safe use \n[pursuant to Subpart H, 21 C.F.R. § 514.520].” H.R. 3580, 110th Cong. (2007). Thus, \nif the FDA previously attached postmarketing restrictions on a drug approved under \nSubpart H, the FDAAA converted those restrictions into a REMS.  \n96.  For example, drugs like mifepristone previously approved with added \nsafeguards were temporarily “deemed to have in effect an approved [REMS].” Pub. L. \nNo. 110-85 at § 909(b)(1). And in 2011, the FDA approved a REMS for mifepristone \nthat “incorporated the restrictions under which the drug was originally approved.”21 \n97.  The FDA may require that the REMS “include such elements as are \nnecessary to assure safe use of the drug, because of its inherent toxicity or potential \nharmfulness” if the agency determines that the drug “is associated with a serious \nadverse drug experience.” 21 U.S.C. § 355-1(f)(1). \n98.  These  “Elements  to  Assure  Safe  Use”  (ETASU)  may  require \n(1) prescribers of the drug “have particular training or experience” or be “specially \ncertified,” (2) practitioners or health care settings that dispense the drug be “specially \ncertified,” (3) doctors dispense the drug to patients “only in certain health care \nsettings, such as hospitals,” (4) doctors dispense the drug to patients “with evidence \nor  other  documentation  of  safe-use  conditions,  such  as  laboratory  test  results,” \n(5) each patient be subject to “certain monitoring,” and (6) each patient be enrolled in \na “registry.” 21 U.S.C. § 355-1(f)(3). \n99.  The  FDA  may  require  an  applicant  to  monitor  and  evaluate \nimplementation of the REMS, in addition to working to improve those elements. 21 \nU.S.C. § 355-1(g). \n                                            \n21 Ex. 2, 2016 Summary Review at 4. \n21 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z     Document 217     Filed 01/16/25      Page 22 of 199     PageID 12254\n100.  The  FDA  may  also  include  a  communication  plan  to  health  care \nproviders to disseminate certain information about the drug and its risks. 21 U.S.C. \n§ 355-1(e)(3). \n101.  An applicant “may propose the addition, modification, or removal of [the \nink REMS] . . . and shall include an adequate rationale to support such proposed \naddition, modification, or removal.” 21 U.S.C. § 355-1(g)(4)(A). \nE.  Federal Laws Restrict Distribution of Abortion Drugs to Women. \n102.  Two federal laws restrict the distribution of abortion-inducing drugs. 18 \nU.S.C. §§ 1461–62.  \n103.  First, 18 U.S.C. § 1461 prohibits the use of postal “mails” to convey or \ndeliver abortion drugs to women. Specifically, it prohibits the mailing or delivery by \nany letter carrier of “[e]very article or thing designed, adapted, or intended for \nproducing  abortion”  and  “[e]very  …  drug…advertised  or  described  in  a  manner \ncalculated to lead to another to use or apply it for producing abortion.” \n104.  Second, 18 U.S.C. § 1462 broadly prohibits the use of “any express \ncompany or other common carrier” or “interactive computer service” to transport \nabortion drugs in interstate or foreign commerce to women. Specifically, it prohibits \nthe use of any express company, common carrier, or interactive computer service to \ndistribute “any drug, medicine, article, or thing designed, adapted, or intended for \nproducing abortion.” \nIV. The FDA’s Review and Approval of the Population Council’s Application \nto Market Abortion Drugs in the United States. \n105.  The French pharmaceutical company Roussel Uclaf S.A. first developed \nand tested mifepristone under the name RU-486. By April 1990, the drug had become \nfully available in France.22 \n                                            \n22 Ex. 15, 2002 Citizen Petition of AAPLOG to FDA at 7–8 (Aug. 8, 2002). \n22 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z     Document 217     Filed 01/16/25      Page 23 of 199     PageID 12255\n106.  After  obtaining  the  American  patent  rights  to  mifepristone,  the \nPopulation Council, a not-for-profit organization, conducted clinical trials in the \nUnited States.23 \n107.  The  Population  Council  then  filed  a  new  drug  application  for \n“mifepristone 200 mg tablets” on March 18, 1996.24 It received priority review.25 \n108.  The FDA approved mifepristone in 2000. The FDA said it had considered \nthe drug under Subpart H because “restrictions ... on the distribution and use of \nmifepristone are needed to assure safe use of this product.”26 \n109.  The FDA told the Population Council that the agency would proceed \nunder Subpart H because the FDA “concluded that adequate information has not \nbeen presented to demonstrate that the drug, when marketed in accordance with the \nterms of distribution proposed, is safe and effective for use as recommended.”27 \n110.  Given the known dangers of abortion drugs, the FDA approved the \nPopulation Council’s application under Subpart H because this was the only means \n“to assure safe use.” 21 C.F.R. § 314.520. \n111.  On  September  28,  2000,  the  FDA  approved  abortion  drugs  under \nSubpart H “for the medical termination of intrauterine pregnancies through 49 days’ \npregnancy.”28  \n                                            \n23 Id. at 9. \n24 Id. at 10. \n25 Id. \n26 Ex. 16, FDA Letter to Population Council re: NDA (Feb. 18, 2000) at 5. \n27 Id. \n28 Ex. 17, 2000 FDA Approval Letter for Mifeprex (mifepristone) Tablets at 1 (Sept. \n28, 2000). \n23 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z     Document 217     Filed 01/16/25      Page 24 of 199     PageID 12256\n112.  The FDA informed the Population Council that Subpart H “applies when \nFDA concludes that a drug product shown to be effective can be safely used only if \ndistribution or use is restricted, such as to certain physicians with certain skills or \nexperience.”29 \n113.  The FDA could not approve mifepristone without invoking Subpart H, \nas it was the only authority under which it could apply postmarketing restrictions on \nabortion drugs.30 \n114.  The FDA stated that mifepristone “labeling is now part of a total risk \nmanagement program.” In particular, “[t]he professional labeling, Medication Guide, \nPatient Agreement, and Prescriber’s Agreement will together constitute the approved \nproduct labeling to ensure any future generic drug manufacturers will have the same \nrisk management program.”31 \n115.  The 2000 approval required the Population Council to include on the \ndrugs’ label a “black box warning for special problems, particularly those that may \nlead to death or serious injury.”32 \n116.  It also contained measures to assure safe use, including requiring at \nleast three office visits: (1) the Day 1 in-person dispensing and administration of \nmifepristone; (2) the Day 3 in-person dispensing and administration of misoprostol; \n                                            \n29 Ex. 18, 2000 FDA Approval Memo. to Population Council re: NDA 20-687 Mifeprex \n(mifepristone) at 6 (Sept. 28, 2000) (2000 FDA Approval Memo). \n30 Ex. 19, 2003 Citizen Petitioners’ Response to Opposition Comments filed by The \nPopulation Council, Inc. and Danco Laboratories, LLC to Comments at 2–4 (Oct. 10, \n2003),  https://www.aaplog.org/wp-content/uploads/2002/08/ResponseToDanco10-\n03reRU-486.pdf (2003 Response). \n31 Supra note 29, 2000 FDA Approval Memo at 2. \n32 Id. \n24 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z     Document 217     Filed 01/16/25      Page 25 of 199     PageID 12257\nand (3) the Day 14 return to the doctor’s office to confirm no fetal parts or tissue \nremain.33 \n117.  The FDA explained that “[r]eturning to the health care provider on Day \n3 for misoprostol . . . assures that the misoprostol is correctly administered,” and it \n“has the additional advantage of contact between the patient and health care provider \nto provide ongoing care, and to reinforce the need to return on Day 14 to confirm that \nexpulsion has occurred.”34 \n118.  The FDA’s Subpart H restrictions included the safeguard under which \nany hospitalization, transfusion, or other serious events must be reported.35 \n119.  The FDA’s restrictions on the distribution of mifepristone included: \n•  In-person dispensing; \n•  Secure shipping procedures; \n•  Tracking system ability; \n•  Use of authorized distributors and agents; and \n•  Provision  of  the  drug  through  a  direct,  confidential  physician \ndistribution  system  that  ensures  only  qualified  physicians  will \nreceive the drug for patient dispensing.36 \n120.  The Population Council granted Danco Laboratories, LLC (“Danco”)—\nincorporated in the Cayman Islands in 1995—an exclusive license to manufacture, \nmarket, and distribute Mifeprex in the United States.37 \n                                            \n33 Id. at 2–3. \n34 Id. at 3. \n35 Id. at 6. \n36 Id. \n37 Ex. 15, 2002 Citizen Petition at 9. \n25 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z     Document 217     Filed 01/16/25      Page 26 of 199     PageID 12258\nV. 2002 Citizen Petition \n121.  In  August  2002,  the  American  Association  of  Pro-Life  OBGYNs \n(AAPLOG) and Christian Medical & Dental Associations (CMDA), along with the \nConcerned Women for America, submitted a citizen petition with the FDA pursuant \nto 21 C.F.R. §§ 10.30 and 10.35; 21 C.F.R. Part 314, Subpart H (§§ 314.500–314.560); \nand Section 505 of the FDCA (21 U.S.C. § 355).38  \n122.  Before litigants may seek court intervention, the FDA’s regulations \nrequire them to submit a “citizen petition” requesting the agency take or refrain from \ntaking any form of administration action before filing a lawsuit. 21 C.F.R. §§ 10.30, \n10.45(b). These regulations allow the FDA to indefinitely delay a final response to a \ncitizen petition. 21 C.F.R. § 10.30(e)(2)(iv). The FDA’s eventual decision on a citizen \npetition constitutes a final agency action for the underlying FDA action and the \nrelated citizen petition, and both are reviewable in the courts under the APA. 21 \nC.F.R. § 10.45(c). \n123.  Following  the  procedure  outlined  in  21  C.F.R.  §  10.45(b),  the  2002 \nPetitioners requested that the FDA impose an immediate stay of the approval of \nmifepristone and ultimately revoke the approval, in addition to requesting a full FDA \naudit of the underlying clinical studies.39 \n124.  The  2002  Petitioners  challenged  the  FDA’s  2000  Approval  because \nDanco’s studies included safeguards not included in the approved label.40 \n                                            \n38 Id. at 1. \n39 Id. \n40 Id. at 76. \n26 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z     Document 217     Filed 01/16/25      Page 27 of 199     PageID 12259\nVI. Implementation of a REMS for Mifepristone. \n125.  After receiving the 2002 Citizen Petition, the FDA followed Congress’s \nmandate under the FDAAA to convert Subpart H postmarketing restrictions for \npreviously approved drugs into a REMS under Section 909(b)(1).  \n126.  In  a  March  27,  2008  Federal  Register  notice,  the  FDA  identified \nmifepristone as one of “those drugs that FDA has determined will be deemed to have \nin effect an approved REMS.”41 \n127.  In 2011, the FDA then approved a REMS for mifepristone.42 \n128.  The  FDA  “determined  that  a  REMS  is  necessary  for  MIFEPREX \n(mifepristone)  to  ensure  the  benefits  of  the  drug  outweigh  the  risks  of  serious \ncomplications.”43 \n129.  The REMS incorporated the previous Subpart H restrictions (including \na black-box warning on the label for special problems, in-person dispensing, post-\nabortion  office  visits,  the  ability  to  assess  gestational  age  and  diagnose  ectopic \npregnancies, adverse event reporting, and the ability to provide surgical intervention \nor ensure patient access to other qualified physicians or medical facilities). The new \nREMS  consisted  of  a  Medication  Guide,  elements  to  assure  safe  use,  an \nimplementation  system,  and  a  timetable  for  submission  of  assessments  of  the \nREMS.44 \n                                            \n41 Identification of Drug and Biological Products Deemed to Have Risk Evaluation \nand  Mitigation  Strategies  for  Purposes  of  the  Food  and  Drug  Administration \nAmendments Act of 2007, 73 Fed. Reg. 16,313, 16,314 (Mar. 27, 2008). \n42 Ex. 20, 2011 FDA Supplemental Approval Letter to Danco Laboratories, LLC at 1 \n(June 6, 2011) (2011 Approval Letter). \n43 Id. at 1. \n44 Id. at 1; Ex. 21, 2011 REMS for NDA 20-687 Mifeprex (mifepristone) Tablets, \n200mg (June 8, 2011) (2011 REMS). \n27 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z     Document 217     Filed 01/16/25      Page 28 of 199     PageID 12260\n130.  The REMS required “prescribers to certify that they are qualified to \nprescribe  MIFEPREX  (mifepristone)  and  are  able  to  assure  patient  access  to \nappropriate medical facilities to manage any complications.”45 \n131.  The FDA also instructed Danco that, “[a]s part of the approval under \nSubpart H, as required by 21 CFR § 314.550, you must submit all promotional \nmaterials, including promotional labeling as well as advertisements, at least 30 days \nbefore the intended time of initial distribution of the labeling or initial publication of \nthe advertisement.”46 \nVII. The FDA’s Denial of the 2002 Citizen Petition. \n132.  Almost fourteen years after receiving the 2002 Citizen Petition—on \nMarch 29, 2016—the FDA denied the 2002 Citizen Petition (“2016 Denial”).47 \nVIII. The FDA’s 2016 Major Changes to the Mifepristone Regimen. \n133.  On the same day that the FDA denied the 2002 Citizen Petition, it also \napproved “major changes” to the mifepristone regimen (2016 Major Changes) in \nresponse to an sNDA that Danco had submitted to the FDA on May 28, 2015.48 \n134.  The FDA acknowledged that “these major changes are interrelated,” \ndemonstrating the agency’s awareness that each change impacted the others.49 \n                                            \n45 Ex. 20, 2011 Approval Letter at 1; Ex. 21, 2011 REMS. \n46 Ex. 20, 2011 Approval Letter at 2–3. \n47 Ex. 22, 2016 FDA Letter to AAPLOG, Christian Medical & Dental Associations, \nand Concerned Women for America denying 2002 Citizen Petition, Docket No. FDA-\n2002-P-0364 (Mar. 29, 2016) (2016 Petition Denial). \n48 Ex. 23, 2016 FDA Letter to Danco Laboratories re: NDA 020687, Supp 20 (Mar. 29, \n2016). \n49 Ex. 2, 2016 Summary Review at 6. \n28 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z     Document 217     Filed 01/16/25      Page 29 of 199     PageID 12261\n135.   Among other things, the 2016 Major Changes included the following \nrevisions: \nA.  extending the maximum gestational age at which a woman or a girl can \nabort her baby from 49 days to 70 days; \nB.  removing the requirement for any in-person follow-up examination after \nan abortion (including follow-up examinations on Days 3 and 14);  \nC.  allowing “healthcare providers” other than physicians to dispense and \nadminister the abortion drugs.50 \n136.  Despite these three major changes to the regimen, the FDA eliminated \nthe safeguard under which prescribers must report all nonfatal serious adverse \nevents from mifepristone. Rather than require future adverse-event reports from \nabortion providers, the FDA simply asserted that “after 15 years of reporting serious \nadverse events, the safety profile for Mifeprex is essentially unchanged.” The FDA \nconceded that “[i]t is important that the Agency be informed of any deaths with \nMifeprex to monitor new safety signals or trends.”51 \n137.  The  2016  Major  Changes  also  included changes  to  dosing,  route  of \nadministration, and timing of administration, which are not challenged here. \nF.  The FDA’s Evidence for the Safety and Effectiveness of the 2016 \nMajor Changes. \n138.  Despite acknowledging that the 2016 changes were interrelated, the \nFDA’s review and approval did not include a single study that evaluated the safety \nand effectiveness of mifepristone and misoprostol under the conditions prescribed, \nrecommended, or suggested in the proposed labeling. In particular, it did not assess \n                                            \n50 Id. at 6–10. \n51 Id. at 27. \n29 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z     Document 217     Filed 01/16/25      Page 30 of 199     PageID 12262\nthe  cumulative  effects  of  increasing  the  gestational  age  from  7  to  10  weeks, \neliminating follow-up visits to check for complications, and requiring the supervision \nof a physician capable of treating complications. \n139.  Instead, the FDA relied on studies that evaluated only one or some of \nthe changes. And many studies included additional safeguards not required under \nthe new REMS, such as an ultrasound to confirm gestational age and pregnancy \nlocation. \n140.  The FDA never explained why it could rely on studies assessing only \nsome of the interrelated changes. \n141.  For example, the FDA relied on three studies that “closely mirrored” the \n2016 changes,52 but all of them included in-person, post-abortion follow-up visits—\none  of  the  safeguards  the  agency  removed  despite  previously  calling  it  “very \nimportant.”53 Yet the FDA provided no explanation for why it could rely on this study \nfor amending the gestational age, physician requirement, and follow-up visits. \n142.  Additionally, increasing the maximum gestational age by three full \nweeks indisputably increases rates of abortion failures, surgical interventions, and \ncomplications.54 Simultaneously removing the two in-person follow-up visits that \nafford the opportunity to diagnose and treat complications before they result in an \n                                            \n52 See Brief for the Federal Petitioners at 38–39, FDA v.

But the FDA did not assess the impacts of \ndoing both in any study.55 \n143.  As the Fifth Circuit noted, such variations between the study conditions \nand the approved labeling and the collective impact of all the 2016 changes as a whole \nare  “unquestionably  an  important  aspect  of  the  problem”  that  the  FDA  had  a \nstatutory duty to address. AHM, 78 F.4th at 246. It therefore held: “[t]he problem is \nnot that [the] FDA failed to conduct a clinical trial that included each of the proposed \nchanges as a control,” but that the “FDA failed to address the cumulative effect at \nall.” Id. \nG.  The FDA’s Lack of Research on Pediatric Populations for the \n2016 Major Changes. \n144.  The FDA’s 2016 Major Changes continued to allow pregnant girls of any \nage to use mifepristone—despite not studying whether these dangerous drugs could \nhave an adverse impact on the health, safety, and welfare of developing girls.  \n145.  The FDA did not require Danco to submit an assessment on the safety \nand  effectiveness  of  the  drug  for  the  claimed  indications  in  relevant  pediatric \nsubpopulations,  nor  did  the  FDA  require  Danco  to  submit  an  assessment  that \nsupported the dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which \nthe drug is safe and effective.56   \n146.  Under PREA, “[i]f the course of the disease and the effects of the drug \nare sufficiently similar in adults and pediatric patients, the [FDA] may conclude that \npediatric effectiveness can be extrapolated from adequate and well-controlled studies \nin  adults,  usually  supplemented  with  other  information  obtained  in  pediatric \n                                            \n55 See Ex. 2, Harrison Reply. Decl. ¶ 16. \n56 Ex. 2, 2016 Summary Review at 18–20. \n31 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z     Document 217     Filed 01/16/25      Page 32 of 199     PageID 12264\npatients, such as pharmacokinetic studies.” 21 U.S.C. § 355c(a)(2)(B)(i) (emphasis \nadded). \n147.  PREA also requires the drug sponsor to include “[a] brief documentation \nof the scientific data supporting the conclusion” that extrapolation is warranted “in \nany pertinent review for the application under section 355 of this title[.]” 21 U.S.C. \n§ 355c(a)(2)(B)(iii). \n148.  Pregnancy is not a disease.57 The FDA therefore lacked authority under \n§ 355c(a)(2)(B)(i) to extrapolate pediatric effectiveness. \n149.  The FDA then concluded that Danco fulfilled its PREA obligations “by \nsubmitting  published  studies  of  Mifeprex  for  pregnancy  termination  in \npostmenarcheal females less than 17 years old.” The FDA cited three published \nstudies in support of this conclusion.58 None of them satisfied the PREA requirement \nfor a specific assessment of safety for pediatric populations. \n150.  The  FDA  must  also  consider  “data,  gathered  using  appropriate \nformulations for each age group for which the assessment is required, that are \nadequate—(1) to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug or the biological \nproduct for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations; and (2) to \nsupport dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the \ndrug or the biological product is safe and effective.” 21 U.S.C. § 355c(a)(2)(A). The \nstudies relied upon by the FDA did not do either of these two things. \n151.  The primary study on which the FDA relied, Efficacy and safety of \nmedical abortion using mifepristone and buccal misoprostol through 63 days, by Mary \n                                            \n57 California by & through Becerra v. Azar, 950 F.3d 1067, 1090 n.20 (9th Cir. 2020) \n(en  banc)  (“Pregnancy  is  not  a  disease,  and  a  nontherapeutic  abortion  is  not a \ntreatment option.”).   \n58 Ex. 2, 2016 Summary Review at 18–19. \n32 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z     Document 217     Filed 01/16/25      Page 33 of 199     PageID 12265\nGatter  and  Deborah  Nucatola  of  Planned  Parenthood  of  Los  Angeles  and  Kelly \nCleland  of  Princeton  University’s  Office  of  Population  Research,  evaluated  the \nproposed dosing regimen followed by home administration of misoprostol through 63 \ndays’ gestation. The study also included postmenarcheal girls in the study population, \nfrom which the FDA extrapolated its conclusion.59  \n152.  A second study that the FDA cited in support of its PREA conclusion \nwas based on a nationwide registry of induced abortions and hospital-register data in \nFinland.60 For the adolescent cohort who had chemical abortions, the study found \nthat 12.8% experienced hemorrhaging, 7.0% had incomplete abortions, and 11.0% \nneeded surgical evacuation of “retained products of conception.”61 Because these \nstatistics were similar to those of the adult cohort, the FDA found these statistics \n“reassuring” to support the safety profile of chemical-abortion drugs for a pediatric \npopulation.62 \n153.  The third and final study that the FDA discussed was a study of 28 \nadolescents, ages 14 to 17 years old, with pregnancies under 57 days’ gestation.63 The \nauthors  of  this  study  cautioned  that  a  larger  study  was  needed  to  make  any \ngeneralizable conclusions for pediatric populations.  \n154.  The  FDA  did  not  require  any  studies  on  the  long-term  effects  of \nmifepristone in pediatric populations with developing reproductive systems. \n                                            \n59 Id. at 19 (citing Ex. 28, Mary Gatter et al., Efficacy and safety of medical abortion \nusing mifepristone and buccal misoprostol through 63 days, 91 Contraception 269 \n(2015)). \n60 Ex. 2, 2016 Summary Review at 19–20 (citing Ex. 6, Niinimaki, supra note 11). \n61 Ex. 6, Niinimaki, supra note 11 at 3–4. \n62 Ex. 2, 2016 Summary Review at 20. \n63 Id. at 19. \n33 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z     Document 217     Filed 01/16/25      Page 34 of 199     PageID 12266\n155.  Given  the  limitations  with  the  three  cited  studies,  FDA  needed  to \nextrapolate the safety of the 2016 Major Changes for adolescent girls. But the agency \ncould  not  avail itself  of  the  extrapolation  exception  because  pregnancy  is  not  a \n“disease.” \nIX. 2019 Citizen Petition \n156.  In response to the 2016 Major Changes, on March 29, 2019, AAPLOG \nand American College of Pediatricians (ACPeds) (collectively, the 2019 Petitioners) \nsubmitted to the FDA a citizen petition (2019 Citizen Petition) pursuant to 21 C.F.R. \n§§ 10.30 and 10.35; 21 C.F.R. Part 314, Subpart H (§§ 314.500–314.560); and Section \n505 of the FDCA (21 U.S.C. § 355).  \n157.  The 2019 Petitioners asked the FDA to (1) “restore and strengthen \nelements of the Mifeprex regimen and prescriber requirements approved in 2000” \nand, in the event that the FDA denied that request, (2) “retain the Mifeprex Risk \nEvaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS), and continue limiting the dispensing of \nMifeprex  to  patients  in  clinics,  medical  offices,  and  hospitals,  by  or  under  the \nsupervision of a certified prescriber.”64 \n158.   The 2019 Citizen Petition asked the FDA to take the following actions \nto  restore  and  strengthen  elements  of  the  chemical-abortion-drug  regimen  and \nprescriber requirements approved in 2000 to protect the health, safety, and welfare \nof women: \nA.  Reducing the maximum gestational age from 70 days to 49 days; \nB.  Limiting  the  ability  to  prescribe  and  dispense  abortion  drugs  to \nqualified, licensed physicians—not other “healthcare providers”; \n                                            \n64 Ex. 29, 2019 Citizen Petition of AAPLOG to FDA (Mar. 29, 2019). \n34 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z     Document 217     Filed 01/16/25      Page 35 of 199     PageID 12267\nC.  Mandating  certified  abortion  providers  be  physically  present  when \ndispensing abortion drugs; \nD.  Requiring  that  the  prescriber  perform  an  ultrasound  to  assess \ngestational age, identify ectopic pregnancies, ensure compliance with \nFDA restrictions, and adequately inform the woman of gestational age-\nspecific risks, which rise with increasing gestational age; \nE.  Restoring the requirement for in-person administration of misoprostol; \nF.  Restoring the requirement for an in-person follow-up visit to confirm \nabortion  and  rule  out  life-threatening  infection  through  clinical \nexamination or ultrasonographic scan; \nG.  Restoring the 2000 label language that stated that abortion drugs are \ncontraindicated if a woman lacks adequate access to emergency medical \ncare; and \nH.  Restoring the prescriber reporting requirements for all serious adverse \nevents,  including  any  deaths,  hospitalizations,  blood  transfusions, \nemergency room visits, failures requiring surgical completion, ongoing \npregnancy, or other major complications following the chemical abortion \nregimen.65 \n159.  The 2019 Petitioners also asked the FDA to require a formal study of \noutcomes for at-risk populations, including the pediatric female population, patients \nwith repeat chemical abortions, patients who have limited access to emergency room \nservices, and patients who self-administer misoprostol.66 \n                                            \n65 Id. \n66 Id. at 13–14. \n35 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z     Document 217     Filed 01/16/25      Page 36 of 199     PageID 12268\n160.  The 2019 Citizen Petition explained that “[t]he developmental stage of \npuberty involves a complex interplay of both progesterone and estrogen effects on the \ndeveloping female reproductive system.” Therefore, “[t]he use, and especially the \npotential multiple use, of Mifeprex, which is a powerful progesterone blocker, is likely \nto  significantly  impact  the  developing  reproductive  system  of  the  adolescent \nfemale.”67  \n161.  At a minimum, the 2019 Citizen Petition requested that the FDA retain \nthe mifepristone REMS and continue limiting the dispensing of mifepristone to \nclinics, medical offices, and hospitals, by or under the supervision of a certified \nprescriber. In other words, it requested the FDA do no further harm to the few \nremaining safeguards for women who undergo the abortion drug regimen.68 \n162.  In  particular,  the  2019  Petitioners  explained  that  eliminating  or \nrelaxing  the  REMS  to  facilitate  internet  or  telephone  prescriptions  would  be \ndangerous  to  women.69  The  2019  Citizen  Petition  also  raised  concerns  about \ndispensing from a pharmacy instead of a clinical facility.70 \n163.  The 2019 Citizen Petition provided the FDA with detailed analysis and \ndata to support these requests. \n                                            \n67 Id. \n68 Id. at 14–25. \n69 Id. at 18–20. \n70 Id. at 20–23. \n36 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z     Document 217     Filed 01/16/25      Page 37 of 199     PageID 12269\nX. The FDA’s Approval of a Generic Version of Mifeprex and a Single, Shared \nSystem REMS. \n164.  On April 11, 2019, the FDA approved GenBioPro, Inc.’s71 generic version \nof Mifeprex, “Mifepristone Tablets, 200 mg” (2019 ANDA Approval) since the agency \n“concluded that adequate information has been presented to demonstrate that the \ndrug is safe and effective for use as recommended in the submitted labeling.”72 The \nFDA determined GenBioPro’s Mifepristone Tablets, 200 mg, “to be bioequivalent and, \ntherefore, therapeutically equivalent to the reference listed drug (RLD), Mifeprex \nTablets,  200  mg,  of  Danco  Laboratories,  LLC.”  GenBioPro’s  generic  version  of \nmifepristone has the same labeling and REMS as does Danco’s Mifeprex.73 GenBioPro \nsells the only generic mifepristone and misoprostol, and these sales are the company’s \nonly product and sole source of revenue.74 \n165.   On  the  same  day,  the  FDA  approved  modifications  to  the  existing \nREMS for mifepristone to establish a single, shared system REMS for mifepristone \nproducts for the “medical termination of intrauterine pregnancy,” thus allowing the \nFDA to have a uniform REMS for the abortion drugs that two companies were now \n                                            \n71 GenBioPro, Inc. is located at 3651 Lindell Road, Suite D1041, Las Vegas, Nevada. \nhttps://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/fda/fdaDrugXsl.cfm?setid=4179736a-1cb2-\n4661-8c50-3d68ec7f4025&type=display. \n72 Ex. 30, 2019 FDA ANDA Approval Letter to GenBioPro, Inc.

The FDA did not make any substantive modifications to the REMS \napproved in 2016.75 \nXI. 2020 ACOG-SMFM Letter to the FDA. \n166.  On  April  20,  2020,  the  American  College  of  Obstetricians  and \nGynecologists (ACOG) and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine (SMFM) sent a \njoint letter (2020 ACOG-SMFM Letter), rather than a citizen petition, to the FDA \nasking the agency to remove the in-person dispensing protection for mifepristone \nduring the COVID-19 pandemic and instead allow dispensing by mail or mail-order \npharmacy.76 \n167.   One month later, ACOG and others filed suit to enjoin the FDA’s in-\nperson dispensing protection for mifepristone during the pandemic. Am. Coll. of \nObstetricians & Gynecologists v. FDA, 472 F. Supp. 3d 183 (D. Md. 2020). \n168.  The  district  court  granted  a  nationwide  preliminary  injunction  and \nlifted the in-person dispensing protection for the pandemic.

Id. at 4, 13. The FDA also explained that it had reviewed \n“thousands of adverse events resulting from the use of Mifeprex,” determined that \nabortion drugs continue to cause “serious risks for up to seven percent of patients,” \nand concluded that an in-office visit was “necessary to mitigate [those] serious risks.” \nId. at 4, 7, 21.

Just three months after the Supreme Court granted FDA’s request for a \nstay, on April 12, 2021, the FDA stated that it “intends to exercise enforcement \ndiscretion” of the in-person dispensing protection during the COVID pandemic (2021 \nNon-Enforcement Decision).77 \n171.   The  FDA’s  2021  Non-Enforcement  Decision  relied,  in  part,  on  a \nsupposed  lack  of  reported  adverse  events  occurring  between  January  2020  and \nJanuary 2021—despite the agency’s elimination of non-fatal reporting requirements \nfor abortion providers in 2016. Nevertheless, in 2021, the FDA still “found that the \nsmall number of adverse events reported to FDA during the COVID-19 public health \nemergency  (PHE)  provided  no  indication  that  any  program  deviation  or \nnoncompliance with the Mifepristone REMS Program contributed to the reported \nadverse events.”78 But given the limitations of the FDA’s adverse-event reporting, the \nagency could not—and did not—conclude that these reported events showed that \nremoving the in-person dispensing protection was safe for women’s health.79 \n                                            \n77 Ex. 32, 2021 FDA Letter to ACOG and SMFM About Mifepristone REMS, at 2 (Apr. \n12, 2021). \n78 Id.  \n79 Id. \n39 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z     Document 217     Filed 01/16/25      Page 40 of 199     PageID 12272\n172.  The FDA’s 2021 Non-Enforcement Decision neither acknowledged nor \naddressed the federal laws expressly prohibiting the distribution of mifepristone by \nmail, express company, common carrier, or interactive computer service—despite \nexplicitly  recognizing  that  this  action  would  allow  “dispensing  of  mifepristone \nthrough the mail . . . or through a mail-order pharmacy.”80 \nXIII.  The FDA’s December 2021 Decision to Permanently Remove the In-\nPerson Dispensing Protections. \n173.  In  a  December  16,  2021  letter,  the  FDA  “determined  that  the \nMifepristone REMS Program continues to be necessary to ensure that the benefits of \nthe drug outweigh the risks,” but that “it must be modified to minimize the burden \non the health care delivery system of complying with the REMS and to ensure that \nthe benefits of the drug outweigh the risks.”81 \n174.   The  letter  identified  specific  new  modifications  to  the  REMS: \n“(1) removing  the  requirement  that  mifepristone  be  dispensed  only  in  certain \nhealthcare settings, specifically clinics, medical offices, and hospitals (i.e., the ‘in-\nperson dispensing requirement’); and (2) adding a requirement that pharmacies that \ndispense the drug be specially certified,” signaling that the FDA would soon allow \npharmacies to dispense abortion drugs.82 \n175.  The Letter acknowledged that the FDA had answered the “related” 2019 \nCitizen Petition and would post the agency’s response in the public docket.83 \n                                            \n80 Id. \n81  Ex.  33,  2021  FDA  Center  for  Drug  Evaluation  &  Research  Director  Patrizia \nCavazzoni Letter to Dr. Graham Chelius (Dec. 16, 2021).   \n82 Id. \n83 Id. \n40 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z     Document 217     Filed 01/16/25      Page 41 of 199     PageID 12273\nXIV.  The FDA’s Denial and Grant of the 2019 Citizen Petition. \n176.  That same day—and over 2.5 years after receiving the 2019 Citizen \nPetition—the FDA denied in part and granted in part the 2019 Citizen Petition (2021 \nFDA Response).84  \n177.  The FDA granted the 2019 Citizen Petition only to the extent that the \nagency agreed that a REMS is necessary to ensure that the “benefits of mifepristone \nin a regimen with misoprostol outweigh the risks.” But the FDA retained only the \nPrescriber Agreement Form and the Patient Agreement Form as the remaining \nelements of the REMS.85 \n178.  The FDA otherwise denied the 2019 Citizen Petition’s requests (1) to \nrestore and strengthen the mifepristone and prescriber requirements approved in \n2000 and (2) to continue limiting the dispensing of mifepristone to women in clinics, \nmedical offices, and hospitals, by or under the supervision of a certified prescriber.86 \n179.  The FDA defended its decision to remove safeguards in the 2016 Major \nChanges  and  repeated  its  previous  justifications  not  to  require  studies  in  the \npertinent pediatric population in the 2016 Major Changes. The agency again asserted \nthat “the safety and efficacy were expected to be the same for postpubertal (i.e., post-\nmenarchal) adolescents.”87 \n180.  The  FDA  further  stated  that  the  REMS  for  mifepristone  “must  be \nmodified to remove the requirement that mifepristone be dispensed only in certain \nhealthcare settings, specifically clinics, medical offices, and hospitals, because this \n                                            \n84 Ex. 34, 2021 FDA Letter to AAPLOG and Am.

In support of its claim that in-person dispensing is unnecessary, the \nFDA relied on the “small” number of adverse events voluntarily reported in the FDA \nAdverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database to justify the elimination of this \nsafeguard, even though the FDA had years before removed the requirement for \nabortion providers to report nonfatal adverse events.89 \n182.  The FDA relied on the FAERS database despite conceding these facts: \n“FAERS data does have limitations”; the “FDA does not receive reports for every \nadverse event”; and thus “FAERS data cannot be used to calculate the incidence of \nan adverse event . . . in the U.S.”90 \n183.  The FAERS “is woefully inadequate to determine the post-marketing \nsafety of mifepristone due to its inability to adequately assess the frequency or \nseverity of adverse events” and the adverse events reported to the FDA “represent a \nfraction of the actual adverse events occurring in American women.”91 Reporting \n“discrepancies  [that]  render  the  FAERS  inadequate  to  evaluate  the  safety  of \nmifepristone abortions.”92  \n                                            \n88 Id. at 25. \n89 Id. at 25–36. \n90  Ex.  35,  Questions  and  Answers  on  FDA’s  Adverse  Event  Reporting  System \n(FAERS),  https://www.fda.gov/drugs/surveillance/questions-and-answers-fdas-\nadverse-event-reporting-system-faers. \n91 Ex. 36, Kathi A.

The complicated FAERS electronic submission process further hinders \nthe reporting of adverse events and exacerbates the unreliability of the number of \nadverse event reports.93 Doctors or other interested individuals seeking to submit an \nadverse  event  report  must  navigate  a  confusing,  complicated,  acronym-laden \nwebpage.94 Recognizing this difficulty in submitting adverse event reports, the FDA \nprovides a 48-page manual as guidance on the technical specifications for submitting \nan adverse event form.95 \n185.  In  addition  to  FAERS  data,  the  FDA  evaluated  “assessment  data” \nconcerning  healthcare  provider  certification,  program  utilization,  and  non-\ncompliance. It noted that the eight reported cases of adverse events from these data \nwere also identified in the FAERS database.96 \n186.  The FDA also claimed support from published literature evaluating \nmail-order dispensing by pharmacies and clinics.97 Yet the agency conceded that it \nwas unable to “generalize” the results to the United States population, and that “the \nusefulness of the studies is limited in some instances by small sample sizes and lack \nof  follow-up  information  on  outcomes.”98  The  FDA  thus acknowledged  that  “the \nstudies [it] reviewed are not adequate on their own to establish the safety of the model \n                                            \n93 Ex. 4, Harrison Compl.

The  FDA  reviewed  three  studies  for  “mail  order  pharmacy \ndispensing.”101  \n188.  One (Hyland) reported that 3 percent of the participants needed to be \nhospitalized—a 330 percent increase over the rate on the approved label.102 The FDA \ndisregarded this dramatic increase, saying it could not make any “conclusions on \n[that study’s] safety findings.”103  \n189.  Another  study  (Upadhyay)  had  certain  “deviations”  from  abortion \npractices in the United States, “limited follow-up information, and small sample \nsize”—all of which “limit[ed] [its] usefulness.”104  \n190.  The  third  study,  an  “interim  analysis”  (Grossman),  was  largely \ninapplicable because it evaluated outcomes for “dispens[ing] by mail-order pharmacy \nafter in-person clinical assessment.”105 \n191.  The FDA also cited five studies that “evaluated clinic dispensing by \nmail.”106  \n                                            \n99 Id. at 35 (emphasis added). \n100 Id. at 28. \n101 Id. at 30. \n102  Id.  at  31.

In one (Raymond), “7 percent of participants had clinical encounters in \n[emergency department (ED)]/urgent care centers.”107  \n193.  In another (Chong), “6 percent of participants had unplanned clinical \nencounters in ED/urgent care,” and “[s]urgical interventions were required in 4.1 \npercent to complete abortion.”108  \n194.  A third study (Anger) revealed that “12.5 percent had an unplanned \nclinical encounter.”109  \n195.  In the fourth study (Kerestes), 5.8 percent in the “telemedicine plus mail \ngroup” had “ED visits,” a rate exceeding the range on the label (2.9 to 4.6 percent) \nand almost three times higher than its 2.1 percent comparator figure for women who \nhad an “in-person” visit.110  \n196.  The  final  study  (Aiken)  had  “significant  limitations”  because \n“investigators were unable to verify the outcomes” and “the study’s design did not \ncapture all serious safety outcomes.”111 \n197.  After reviewing these studies, the FDA conceded that “the literature \nsuggests there may be more frequent ED/urgent care visits related to the use of \nmifepristone  when  dispensed  by  mail  from  the  clinic.”112  The  agency  similarly \nacknowledged  that  the  Anger  study  “suggests  a  pre-abortion  examination  may \n                                            \n107 Id. at 32. \n108 Id. \n109 Id. at 32–33. \n110 Id. at 33. \n111 Id. at 34. \n112 Id. at 35; accord id. at 33–34. \n45 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z     Document 217     Filed 01/16/25      Page 46 of 199     PageID 12278\ndecrease  the  occurrence  of  procedural  intervention  and  decrease  the  number  of \nunplanned visits for postabortion care.”113  \n198.  Nevertheless, the FDA concluded that “these studies overall support \nthat dispensing by mail from the clinic is safe,”114 and that mifepristone would \n“remain  safe  and  efficacy  [would]  be  maintained”  if  it  removed  the  in-person \ndispensing protection from the REMS program.115 \n199.  The FDA’s 2021 Petition Response neither acknowledged nor addressed \nthe  federal  laws  expressly  prohibiting  the  distribution  of  mifepristone  by  mail, \nexpress company, common carrier, or interactive computer service.  \n200.  In January 2023, the FDA rejected a similar petition submitted on \nDecember 13, 2022, by Students for Life of America and other signatories (SFLA \nPetition).  \n201.  The SFLA Petition requested that the FDA reverse its 2021 and 2016 \nmodifications and restore the 2011 mifepristone REMS. The FDA noted that the relief \nrequested by SFLA was “the same or substantially the same as” the 2019 Citizen \nPetition and directed SFLA to its “December 16, 2021 response to that petition.”116  \n   \n                                            \n113 Id. at 33. \n114 Id. at 34. \n115 Id. at 28. \n116 Ex. 40, 2023 FDA Letter to Students for Life of Am. denying 2022 SFLA Petition, \nDocket No. FDA-2022-P-3209, at 2 (Jan. 3, 2023), https://www.regulations.gov/docu\nment/FDA-2022-P-3209-0003. \n46 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z     Document 217     Filed 01/16/25      Page 47 of 199     PageID 12279\n202.

The FDA’s 2021/2023 Removal of the In-Person Dispensing \nProtection. \n203.  In April 2021, prior to the agency’s denial of almost all of the 2019 \nCitizen  Petition,  the  FDA  “announced  that,  in  connection  with  the  COVID-19 \npandemic,  the  agency  would  not  enforce  the  in-person  dispensing  protection. \nEffectively, this allowed mifepristone to be prescribed remotely and sent via mail.” \nAHM, 78 F.4th at 226. The FDA’s April 2021 action expressly allowed “dispensing [] \n47 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z     Document 217     Filed 01/16/25      Page 48 of 199     PageID 12280\nmifepristone through the mail ... or through a mail-order pharmacy” during the \napplicable time period.117  \n204.  In December 2021, the FDA decided to permanently remove the in-\nperson dispensing protection.118 \n205.  Pursuant  to  its  December  2021  decision,  the  FDA  “amended \nmifepristone’s REMS (which applies to Mifeprex and the generic version) in January \nof 2023 to formalize the removal of the in-person dispensing requirement.” AHM, 78 \nF.4th at 226.  \n206.  The  FDA  acknowledged  in  2023  that  it  had  “determined”  on \n“12/16/2021” that “the REMS must be modified to remove the in-person dispensing \nrequirement.”119  \n207.  It added in its 2023 Summary Review that, following its 2021 decision, \n“[t]he number of adverse events reported to FDA during the COVID-19 PHE with \nmifepristone use is small.” And that this additional data “provide[d] no indication \nthat any program deviation or noncompliance with the Mifepristone REMS Program \ncontributed to these reported adverse events.”120 \n208.  The FDA also noted that the format of the REMS document would not \nbe changed “[t]o avoid the misperception that this REMS modification is making \nmajor  changes  to  the  REMS  document  that  go  beyond  our December  16,  2021, \ndetermination that the REMS must be modified to remove the in-person dispensing \n                                            \n117 Ex. 32, 2021 FDA Letter to ACOG and SMFM About Mifepristone REMS at 2. \n118 Ex. 34, 2021 FDA Response at 6. \n119 Ex. 3, FDA 2023 Summary Review at 6. \n120 Id. at 38. \n48 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z     Document 217     Filed 01/16/25      Page 49 of 199     PageID 12281\nrequirement and add pharmacy certification,” and that the “[c]hanges are in line with \nthe REMS Modification Notification letters sent December 16, 2021.”121 \n209.  The  FDA’s  January  2023  REMS  permanently  “[r]emov[ed]  the \nrequirement  that  mifepristone  be  dispensed  only  in  certain  healthcare  settings, \nspecifically  clinics,  medical  offices  and  hospitals  (i.e.,  the  ‘in-person  dispensing \nrequirement’)” and expanded the program to allow mifepristone to be dispensed by \ncertified pharmacies, including retail pharmacies.122  \n210.  These  actions  comprise  the  2021/2023  Removal  of  the  In-Person \nDispensing Protection.  \n211.  By  March  2024,  one  year  after  the  modified  REMS  took  effect, \nWalgreens and CVS announced they had completed certification requirements and \nwould begin dispensing mifepristone in their stores.123  \n212.  The current Mifeprex Prescriber Agreement Form also requires such \nhealthcare providers to have the “[a]bility to provide surgical intervention in cases of \nincomplete abortion or severe bleeding, or have made plans to provide such care \nthrough others, and be able to assure patient access to medical facilities equipped to \nprovide blood transfusions and resuscitation, if necessary.”124 \n213.  And the current Mifepristone Patient Agreement acknowledges that \n“[m]y healthcare provider has told me that these symptoms listed above could require \n                                            \n121 Id. at 8–9, 16. \n122  Ex.  41,  REMS  Single  Shared  System  for  Mifepristone  200  mg  (Jan.  2023), \nhttps://perma.cc/MJT5-35LF (the “2023 Mail-Order Decision”). \n123 Ex.42, Pam Belluck, CVS and Walgreens Will Begin Selling Abortion Pills This \nMonth, New York Times (March 1, 2024), \nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/01/health/abortion-pills-cvs-walgreens.html. \n124 Ex. 43, Mifeprex Prescriber Agreement Form at 1. \n49 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z     Document 217     Filed 01/16/25      Page 50 of 199     PageID 12282\nemergency care. If I cannot reach the clinic/office/provider right away, my healthcare \nprovider has told me who to call and what to do.”125  \n214.  Dispensing  mifepristone  by  mail  also  poses  potential  problems  for \nmaintaining the appropriate level of active ingredient under uncontrolled shipping \nconditions. One 2018 study of mifepristone from India found that 18 mifepristone-\nmisoprostol combination drugs shipped over a range of three to 21 business days \ncontained within 8% of the labeled 200 mg amount of active mifepristone by the time \nthey reached their destination.126 The study did not control for humidity, heat, or \nother  conditions  affecting  active  ingredient  degradation,  posing  concerns  for \nindividuals receiving abortion drugs exposed to even harsher weather conditions. \nIndeed, the researchers projected that the 35 percent of packages that did not arrive \nwithin  the advertised  shipping  time  “may  have been  delayed  because  of  winter \nweather.”127 \n215.  FDA’s own label for mifepristone requires a storage temperature of \n“25°C (77°F); excursions permitted to 15 to 30°C (59 to 86°F) [see USP Controlled \nRoom Temperature].”128 These conditions cannot be guaranteed during standard \nshipping transit, particularly in summer or winter weather conditions. But the FDA’s \ndecision to allow mail-order abortion drugs neither acknowledged nor addressed this \nknown issue. \n216.  What’s  more,  the  study  noted  that  none  of  the  sites  on  which  the \nabortion drugs were procured “required a prescription or any medical documents. \n                                            \n125 Ex. 44, Mifepristone Patient Agreement at 1. \n126 Chloe Murtagh et al., Exploring the Feasibility of Obtaining Mifepristone and \nMisoprostol from the Internet, 97 Contraception 287 (2018). \n127 Id. at 288 (emphasis added). \n128 Supra note 7, Mifeprex 2023 Label at 13. \n50 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z     Document 217     Filed 01/16/25      Page 51 of 199     PageID 12283\nTwo required completion of an online medical history questionnaire; none of the \nquestions asked about gestational age or any of the specific contraindications listed \non the label for Mifeprex®, the brand of mifepristone approved for abortion by the US \nFood and Drug Administration.”129  \nXVI.  The FDA’s Recognition that Emergency Rooms would be the Backstop \nfor Abortion Drug Harm. \n217.  The FDA has consistently identified emergency rooms as the backstop \nfor abortion drug harms. ER visits are the predictable consequence of its removal of \nsafeguards.130 \n218.  Given the potential for serious adverse events, the FDA recognized that \n“access to ... emergency services is critical for the safe and effective use of the drug.”131 \nThe FDA required and still requires doctors “to assure patient access to medical \nfacilities equipped to provide blood transfusions and resuscitation, if necessary.”132 \nThe  drug  was  also  “contraindicated”  where  “access  to  emergency  services”  was \n“[in]adequate.”133 And the FDA required prescribing physicians without the ability to \nperform  emergency  services  to  “direct”  women  “to  a  hospital  for  emergency \nservices.”134 \n219.  Danco, in consultation with FDA, also issued a “Dear Emergency Room \nDirector” letter in 2004 to “assist [ER Directors] in taking care of patients who may \n                                            \n129 Murtagh, supra note 126 at 288. \n130 See Ex. 4, Harrison Compl.

In its 2011 REMS materials, the FDA warned that women should not \ntake mifepristone if they “cannot easily get emergency medical help [for] 2 weeks” \nafter taking the drug.137 The REMS required prescribers “to assure patient access to \nappropriate medical facilities” that were “equipped to provide blood transfusions and \nresuscitation,  if  necessary.”138  And  the  agency  instructed  women  to  take  the \nmedication guide with them “[w]hen [they] visit an emergency room.”139 \n221.  In its 2016 denial of the 2002 Citizen Petition, the FDA said it would \ncontinue to rely on emergency rooms as a backstop to “ensure that women have access \nto medical facilities for emergency care” to manage the expected complications.140 \n222.  The agency did the same in its 2021 petition denial, noting prescribers \nwere required to “ensure that mifepristone is prescribed [only] to women for whom \nemergency care is available.”141 And prescribers were not themselves required to be \nable to treat life-threatening complications, just “assure patient access to medical \nfacilities equipped to provide blood transfusions and resuscitation.”142 Recognizing \n                                            \n135 Ex. 45, Letter from Danco Labs. to Emergency Room Doctors 1 (Nov. 12, 2004) \nhttps://perma.cc/734R-LLSQ. \n136 Id. \n137 Ex. 21, 2011 REMS at 5. \n138 Id. at 1, 7. \n139 Id. at 4. \n140 Ex. 22, 2016 Petition Denial at 21. \n141 Ex. 34, 2021 FDA Response at 39. \n142 Id. at 9. \n52 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z     Document 217     Filed 01/16/25      Page 53 of 199     PageID 12285\nthat this care would frequently come from emergency rooms, the FDA observed that \n“[i]t is common practice for healthcare providers to provide emergency care coverage \nfor  other  healthcare  providers’  patients,  and  in  many  places,  hospitals  employ \n‘hospitalists’ to provide care to all hospitalized patients.”143 \n223.  In evaluating mail-order dispensing, the FDA relied on five studies. In \none, “7 percent of participants had clinical encounters in [emergency department \n(ED)]/urgent care centers.”144 In another, “6 percent of participants had unplanned \nclinical encounters in ED/urgent care,” and “[s]urgical interventions were required in \n4.1 percent to complete abortion.”145 A third study revealed that “12.5 percent had an \nunplanned clinical encounter.”146 In the fourth study, 5.8 percent in the “telemedicine \nplus mail group” had “ED visits,” which was almost three times higher than “the in-\nperson  group.”147  And  the  last  study  had  “significant  limitations”  because \n“investigators were unable to verify the outcomes” and “the study’s design did not \ncapture all serious safety concerns.”148 \n224.  Finally, the FDA’s current label for mifepristone also directs women to \nemergency rooms if one of many adverse events arises.149 It says that an estimated \n2.9 to 4.6 percent of women will visit the emergency room after taking mifepristone \n                                            \n143 Id. at 12. \n144 Ex. 34, 2021 FDA Response at 32. \n145 Id. \n146 Id. at 32–33. \n147 Id. at 33. \n148 Id. at 34. \n149 Supra note 7, Mifeprex 2023 Label at 2. \n53 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z     Document 217     Filed 01/16/25      Page 54 of 199     PageID 12286\non the label.150 That’s roughly one in 25 women who will end up in the emergency \nroom if they take abortion drugs as directed.  \n225.  The use of emergency rooms to treat abortion harms was a predictable \nconsequence  of  removing  safeguards  around  Mifepristone.151  For  example,  the \npredictable  consequence  of  removing  the  requirement  that  physicians  dispense \nabortion drugs is the “explosion of Mifeprex complications including hemorrhage.”152 \nXVII. Defendants’ actions seek to undermine state abortion laws and state \nlaw enforcement. \n226.  Defendants’ actions undermine state abortion laws and frustrate state \nlaw enforcement.   \n227.  By removing REMS restrictions, the FDA fostered the creation of out-\nof-state  abortion  drug  markets—and  it  facilitated  the  creation  of  abortion-drug \nmarkets that operate by mail, common carrier, and interactive computer service.  \n228.  The FDA loosened the prior safeguards that prevented mifepristone \nfrom being mailed to any state or being dispensed other than in-person.  \n229.  The FDA has done nothing to prevent mifepristone from being mailed to \nany particular state, regardless of federal or state law.  \n230.  Evading state abortion laws has been the FDA’s overarching regulatory \npurpose for mifepristone—even at the cost of harm to women’s health and safety. \n231.  When the FDA began its approval and regulation of abortion drugs, the \nagency admitted that the reason to approve mifepristone was to undermine state \nabortion laws. Ruth B. Merkatz, PhD, RN, FAAN served as the Director of the Office \nof Women’s Health from 1994-1996, and later became a director at the Population \n                                            \n150 Id. at 8. \n151 Ex. 4, Harrison Compl.

In her oral history of the approval of mifepristone, she explained the FDA’s \nintent to use mifepristone to evade state abortion laws: “It was really a revolutionary \ndecade in the ‘90s. We knew RU-486 was going to be very important especially in \nstates where surgical abortions are not permitted. And if they overturn Roe v. Wade, \nit’s going to be really important. What’s interesting if you look through the panels in \nthis program [referring to conference program], these are the topics that I thought \nwere important to discuss. This is in 1994. It includes a panel on RU-486.”153   \n232.  A letter to the FDA in 2016 signed by 30 pro-abortion organizations \nstated, “[a]lthough the FDA may have decided 15 years ago that the balance of risk \nand  burden  came  out  in  favor  of  restricting  mifepristone’s  indicated  use  and \ndistribution, today both science and the current conditions surrounding patient access \nto abortion care call strongly for a reevaluation of the mifepristone label and REMS \nrestrictions, especially its Elements to Assure Safe Use (ETASU).” 154 The letter urged \nthe FDA to “[c]onsider the current legal and social climate,” explaining that “[t]he \noverall legal and social climate around abortion care intensifies all of the burdens \nthat the mifepristone REMS places on patients and makes it even more critical that \nthe FDA lift medically unnecessary restrictions on the drug.”155 \n233.  Early  in  the  Biden-Harris  administration,  Vice  President  Kamala \nHarris promised that the administration would “fight to protect access” to abortion156 \n                                            \n153  FDA,  Oral  History  Interview  with  Ruth  B.

The President tasked HHS and the Department of Justice (DOJ) to \nexplore steps to “ensure access to safe and legal abortion.”158 Officials were to “use \nevery lever at their disposal to ensure … access” for “every woman … across the \ncountry.”159   \n235.  HHS would be a key part of this “whole-of-government approach.”160 \nHHS was “to look for ways to make sure we are providing access to healthcare to \nwomen”  and  the  FDA  would  make  a  decision  about  lifting  the  REMS  on \nmifepristone.161 \n236.  In Dobbs v.

In response, President Biden called Dobbs “an extreme decision”162 by \n“not a normal Court.”163   \n238.  Rather than wait for Congress to heed his call to codify Roe v. Wade, \nPresident Biden “committed to doing everything in his power” to “protect access” to \nabortion.164 He noted, “Some states are saying that they’ll try to ban or severely \nrestrict access to these medications.”165   \n239.  So he issued multiple executive orders mandating access to abortion.166  \n240.  The day Dobbs was issued, “[i]n the face of threats from state officials \nsaying they will try to ban or severely restrict access to medication for reproductive \nhealth care, the President directed the Secretary of Health and Human Services to \nidentify all ways to ensure that mifepristone is as widely accessible as possible in \nlight of the FDA’s determination that the drug is safe and effective—including when \nprescribed  through  telehealth  and  sent  by  mail.”167  President  Biden  specifically \n                                            \n162 White House, Remarks by President Biden Before Meeting with His Task Force \non Reproductive Healthcare Access (Jan. 22, 2024), https://perma.cc/N9KR-TKX9. \n163 White House, Remarks by President Biden on the Supreme Court’s Decision on \nAffirmative Action (June 29, 2023), https://perma.cc/7XU8-3KL4. \n164 White House, FACT SHEET: President Biden to Sign Executive Order Protecting \nAccess to Reproductive Health Care Services (July 8, 2022), https://perma.cc/F5ZZ-\nXGL8. \n165 White House, Remarks by President Biden on the Supreme Court Decision to \nOverturn Roe v.

The  same  day,  Secretary  Becerra  accordingly  announced  HHS’s \n“commitment to ensure every American has access to … medication abortion” and \npromised, “we will double down and use every lever we have to protect access to \nabortion.”169 \n242.  Secretary Becerra explained in a written statement, “At the Department \nof Health and Human Services, we stand unwavering in our commitment to ensure \nevery American has access to health care and the ability to make decisions about \nhealth care -- including the right to safe and legal abortion, such as medication \nabortion that has been approved by the FDA for over 20 years. I have directed every \npart of my Department to do any and everything we can here. As I have said before, \nwe will double down and use every lever we have to protect access to abortion care.”170  \n243.  At a press conference the same day, Secretary Becerra repeated: “HHS \nwill take steps to increase access to medication abortion,” and that “We will leave no \nstone unturned.”171 \n                                            \n168 White House, FACT SHEET: President Biden to Sign Presidential Memorandum \non  Ensuring  Safe  Access  to  Medication  Abortion  (Jan.  22,  2023), \nhttps://perma.cc/S6R9-AT7W. \n169 Press Release, HHS, HHS Secretary Becerra’s Statement on Supreme Court \nRuling  in  Dobbs  v.

President  Biden’s  then  issued  a  follow-up  executive  order  again \ndirecting HHS “to protect and expand access to abortion care, including medication \nabortion.”172  \n245.  In due course, HHS promoted “access” to abortion drugs through the \nFDA REMS process. In section 1 of its post-Dobbs “action plan,” entitled “Access to \nMedication Abortion and Contraception,” HHS said that “HHS will continue its work \nto protect access to FDA-regulated products for abortion that have been found to be \nsafe and effective.” It continued, the “FDA will continue the REMS modification \nprocess and review the applicants’ proposed changes to the REMS related to removing \nthe in-person dispensing requirement.”173  \n246.  After the FDA modified the REMS for mifepristone, HHS issued a report \ncalled Marking the 50th Anniversary of Roe: Biden-Harris Administration Efforts to \nProtect Reproductive Health Care. In this report, HHS identified the January 2023 \nREMS change as one of the actions HHS took since Dobbs to protect access to \nabortion.174  In  an  accompanying  press  release,  HHS  highlighted  the  FDA’s \n                                            \n172 Exec.

As Secretary Becerra explained shortly thereafter, “We’re using our \nauthority as well to secure reproductive health care access for every American who \nneeds it—wherever they are, whenever they need it.”176  \n248.  The White House likewise identified the FDA’s 2023 permanent removal \nof the in-person dispensing protection as an action taken in response to President \nBiden’s July 8, 2022 executive order directing HHS to “protect and expand access to \nabortion care, including medication abortion.”177 \n249.  Another part of the White House’s whole-of-government response to \nDobbs included enlisting DOJ in support of HHS’s actions to undermine state laws \nby creating a 50-state mail-order abortion economy.  \n250.  When  Dobbs  was  decided,  Attorney  General  Merrick  Garland,  the \nnation’s chief law enforcement officer and head of DOJ, promised that DOJ will “work \ntirelessly to protect and advance” abortion and will “use every tool at our disposal.” \n                                            \n175 Press Release, HHS, HHS Releases Report Detailing Biden-Harris Administration \nEfforts  to  Protect  Reproductive  Health  Care  Since  Dobbs  (Jan.  19,  2023), \nhttps://perma.cc/6CE3-J7DD. \n176 Press Release, HHS, HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra Urges Nation to Shift from \nan  “Illness-Care  System”  to  a  “Wellness-Care  System”  at  National  Press  Club \nLuncheon (Feb. 9, 2024), https://perma.cc/R9SF-3VKC. \n177  White  House,  FACT  SHEET:  The  Biden-Harris  Administration’s  Record  on \nProtecting Access to Medication Abortion (Apr. 12, 2023), https://perma.cc/78TT-\n3J2G (citing Exec.

HHS soon reported that it had been working with DOJ “to help ensure \naccess to care and preserve [the] FDA’s role in determining what is safe and effective \nfor patients.”179 HHS said that, “The Attorney General of the United States made \nclear that states may not ban mifepristone based on disagreement with [the] FDA’s \nexpert judgment about its safety and efficacy.”180 These announcements came in a \nformal HHS report entitled Secretary’s Report Health Care Under Attack: An Action \nPlan to Protect and Strengthen Reproductive Care, in a section entitled Federal \nPreemption—Protecting Access to Medication Abortion \n252.  Later, the White House confirmed that this purported preemption was \nanother step that “the Biden-Harris Administration has taken…to protect access to \nmedication abortion.”181 “[P]reserving access” to abortion drugs, the White House \nreiterated, is “one of two key priorities” after Dobbs.182  \nXVIII.  The FDA actions created a 50-state abortion drug mailing economy, \nundermining state abortion laws. \n253.  Defendants’ actions had their predictable and intended effect.  \n254.  First, the FDA’s 2016 actions resulted in the dispensing of abortion \ndrugs to women from Plaintiff States later in pregnancy, without follow-up care, and \n                                            \n178  Press Release, DOJ, Attorney General Merrick B.

Second, the FDA’s 2021/2023 actions removed all in-person dispensing \nprotections and enabled the creation of out-of-state abortion-drug distributors that \ndispense FDA-approved drugs by mail, common carrier, and interactive computer \nservice—all to evade state abortion laws.  \n256.  These actions caused a nationwide increase in chemical abortions, the \nwidespread taking of abortion drugs up to 10 weeks of pregnancy, and the resulting \ncascading medical complications for women.  \nA.  Defendants’ deregulatory actions resulted in women receiving \nabortion  drugs  out-of-state  and  returning  home  to  Plaintiff \nStates with no continuous in-person care.  \n257.  The FDA’s actions enabled abortion providers to dispense abortion drugs \nto  residents  of  Plaintiff  States later in  pregnancy  and  without  follow-up  care—\ncausing  women  to  seek  emergency  services  in  Plaintiff  States  for  treatment  of \nresulting complications. \n258.  This is confirmed by another case concerning the 2016 and 2023 REMS, \nWhole Woman’s Health Alliance v. FDA, in which abortion providers in Virginia, \nMontana, and Kansas confirmed that they now dispense abortion drugs to residents \nof Plaintiff States who travel to them outside of Plaintiff States and then leave follow-\nup care to Plaintiff States’ emergency providers—all because the FDA enabled these \nabortion providers not to provide continuous follow-up care or three in-person doctor \nvisits.183  \n                                            \n183 Ex. 47, Complaint, ECF No. 1, Whole Woman’s Health All. v. FDA, No. 3:23-cv-\n00019-NKM, ¶1 (W.D. Va. May 8, 2023) (hereinafter Whole Woman’s Health Compl.) \nThis  complaint  is  supported  by  sworn  declarations  from  the  plaintiff  abortion \nproviders. See Ex. 48, Rebecca Tong Decl., ECF No. 10-1, Whole Woman’s Health All. \nv. FDA, No. 3:23-cv-00019-NKM (W.D. Va.

Each provider in Whole Woman’s Health Alliance v. FDA uses both \nDanco’s Mifeprex and GenBioPro’s generic mifepristone.184 One of those providers, \nTrust Women, spent $20,000 on brand name mifepristone alone in early 2023.185  \n260.  These abortion providers dispense FDA-approved drugs to women from \nPlaintiff States in order to evade state abortion laws. These providers have made \nwhat they describe as “herculean efforts to provide” abortion drugs “not only for \nresidents of their states, but also for the thousands of patients forced to travel \nhundreds of miles for basic healthcare from the 13 states and counting where abortion \nis now banned, and the many others where it remains severely restricted.”186  \n261.  The FDA’s decision to remove follow-up visit protections enabled Whole \nWoman’s Health (WWH), an abortion provider with locations across the country and \nin Virginia, to provide abortion drugs in one state and then leave follow-up care to \nemergency medical professionals in other states.  \n262.  For  example,  WWH  of  Alexandria  provides  FDA-approved  abortion \ndrugs up to 11 weeks to many women from Plaintiff States with no in-person follow-\nup visits.187 “Because WWH of Alexandria is close to a large airport, many of our \npatients travel to us by plane from states where abortion [is] banned ...

Another of these providers, Trust Women, operates a clinic in Wichita, \nKansas that has provided abortion drugs since it opened in 2013 and that currently \nprovides abortion drugs up to 11 weeks.189 The clinic has “18 doctors, and 16 of them \nfly in to Kansas to provide care.”190 In 2021, almost half of its patients received FDA-\napproved abortion drugs as their method of abortion.191  \n264.  As the provider explained, Trust Women Wichita “experienced a huge \nsurge in patients seeking care following” the Dobbs decision.192 In 2022, the Kansas \nclinic saw patients start coming from hundreds of miles away.193 “Trust Women \nWichita, as one of the few remaining clinics somewhat close to Texas, Oklahoma, and \nother ban states, has seen a massive increase in patients seeking care due to abortion \nbans.194 Specifically, “In 2021, Trust Women Wichita saw around 1500 patients. In \n2022, we saw around 3500 patients. For the first 4 months of 2023, we have seen 2000 \npatients already—on pace for 6,000 for the year. Around two-thirds of our patients \nare coming from out of state.”195 Since Texas’s abortion law “S.B. 8 took effect, it is \nnot uncommon for us to receive tens of thousands of calls a day.”196  \n                                            \n188 Id. ¶ 19 (emphasis added). \n189 Tong Decl. ¶¶ 1, 6. \n190 Id. ¶ 30. \n191 Id. ¶ 35. \n192 Whole Woman’s Health Compl. ¶ 103. \n193 Tong Decl. ¶ 19. \n194 Id.¶ 19. \n195 Id. ¶ 19. \n196 Id. ¶ 21. \n64 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z     Document 217     Filed 01/16/25      Page 65 of 199     PageID 12297\n265.  Montana’s Blue Mountain Clinic likewise considers itself and Montana \nto be “a critical site of access to abortion for people in the greater Northern Rockies \nand Plains regions” as “access” in other states “has grown exponentially worse” since \nDobbs.197  Each  of  Montana’s  neighboring  states—North  Dakota,  South  Dakota, \nWyoming,  and  Idaho—restrict  abortion.198  And  “[a]bout  25%  of  Blue  Mountain \nClinic’s patients travel more than 50 miles” for abortions. Smith Decl. ¶10. Blue \nMountain Clinic provides FDA-approved abortion drugs up to 10 weeks of pregnancy \nto patients physically present in Montana.199 In 2022, “Blue Mountain Clinic provided \nabout 400 abortions. Almost 40% of those abortions were for patients who are insured \nthrough Medicaid (which covers abortion care in Montana).”200  \n266.  All these providers send women from Plaintiff States home without \nongoing care or in-person follow-up visits for abortion drug complications.  \n267.  The FDA’s lack of required in-person follow-up visits results in women \ntraveling across the country to pick up abortion drugs from these providers (and many \nmore like them) before returning home to complete the abortion regimen—leaving \nwomen to seek emergency care in Plaintiff States for the inevitable complications.  \n268.  These abortion providers—the WWH entities, Blue Mountain Clinic, All \nFamilies, and Trust Women Wichita continue to provide abortion drugs in-person to \nthis day.  \n269.  In  another  case,  Washington  v.  FDA,  abortion  providers  similarly \nexplained in sworn declarations how their use of abortion drugs under Defendants’ \n                                            \n197 Smith Decl. ¶ 7. \n198 Id. ¶ 7. \n199 Id. ¶ 13. \n200 Id. ¶ 15. \n65 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z     Document 217     Filed 01/16/25      Page 66 of 199     PageID 12298\nactions have enabled them to evade state laws and leave follow-up care to Plaintiff \nStates.201  \n270.  Cedar  River  Clinic  in  Renton,  Seattle,  Tacoma,  and  Yakima, \nWashington provides abortion drugs to residents and non-residents.202 This clinic is \n“only one of a small handful of full-service abortion clinics in Eastern Washington,” \nnear the Idaho border.203 FDA-approved abortion drugs “make up approximately 40% \nof all the abortions Cedar River Clinics perform.” Cantrell Decl. ¶10. The clinic \nprovides abortion drugs in clinic and via telemedicine to “those traveling from out of \nstate or internationally.”204  \n271.  As Cedar River Clinic explained, “Many of those patients had to travel \ndue to restrictive laws. Since the Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization \ndecision  in  June  2022  and  subsequent  abortion  bans,  Cedar  River  Clinics  are \nexperiencing a rising tide in the volume of individuals coming to Washington from \nother states to seek an abortion. It is not limited to our region; we are serving patients \nfrom across the country especially the South and Midwest who are being impacted by \nthe abortion bans in their states.”205  \n272.  In  this  case,  Washington  v.  FDA,  Planned  Parenthood  of  Greater \nWashington and Northern Idaho (PPGWNI) likewise explained how the current FDA \nREMS enables it to provide FDA-approved abortion drugs to Idaho and other out-of-\n                                            \n201 Washington v.

PPGWNI historically has provided abortion drugs to Idaho residents \nand since 2022 has had an increase in other out-of-state residents seeking abortion \ndrugs. As the provider explained, “With three of our clinics (Spokane, Spokane Valley, \nand Pullman) so close to the border, PPGWNI has long seen patients from Idaho. But \nsince Dobbs, we have seen a significant increase in out-of-state patients.”210 “In \nJanuary 2023, PPGWNI saw an increase of 25% in total abortion patient visits \ncompared to January 2022. We saw a 75% increase in Idaho patients from January \n2023 compared to January 2022.”211 “This includes a 36% increase for procedural \nabortion patient visits and 90% increase for medication abortion visits from Idaho.”212 \n“In our Pullman clinic, we now have an outright majority of patients—53% in 2022 \nand likely higher in 2023—coming from Idaho.”213 “This is up from 39% in 2021.”214 \n“Further, with the closure of PPGWNI’s Boise clinic, we have started to see an influx \n                                            \n206 Ex. 53, Declaration of Paul Dillon, ECF 4-1, Ex. 5, Washington v.

In  the  same  case,  Washington  v.  FDA,  the  Washington  State \nDepartment of Health confirmed that Washington abortion providers like Cedar \nRiver Clinic and PPGWNI dispense abortions to non-Washington residents.218 “In \n2021, there were 15,968 abortions among Washington residents” and “998 abortions \nwere provided to non-residents who traveled from out of state.”219 “Non-residents \nseeking abortion care in Washington came from 41 states, as well as Guam and \nCanada,  with  the  majority  coming  from  Idaho  (406),  Oregon  (330),  and  Alaska \n(51).”220 Abortion sites “in the eastern and southern parts of Washington are most \nlikely to serve patients from Idaho and Oregon respectively based on geographic \nlocation.”221 “In 2021, 59% of the abortions provided in Washington were medication \nabortions.”222  \n275.  Cedar River Clinic and PPGWNI continue to dispense abortion drugs in \nperson to this day.  \n                                            \n215 Id. ¶ 12. \n216 Id. \n217 Id. ¶ 13. \n218 Ex. 54, Declaration of Cynthia Harris, ECF 4-1, Ex. 10, Washington v.

Other abortion providers confirm that they provide abortion drugs to \nwomen from Plaintiff States in single appointments—without three doctor visits or \nother in-person follow-up care. For example, Emily Wales, CEO and president of \nPlanned Parenthood Great Plains, said, “In a matter of months [after Dobbs], we \nstarted serving patients from Texas and Arkansas and Oklahoma … Missourians had \nto really compete for too few appointments” for abortion drugs.223  \n277.  The FDA’s actions removing the protection of three doctor visits enabled \nthese abortion providers to provide abortion drugs to so many women—and enabled \nthem to redirect all emergency care to Plaintiff States.  \n278.  Without these prior FDA safeguards, these providers have increased \ntheir in-person provision of abortion drugs since 2016 (surging after Dobbs) which \nincreases complications for women from Plaintiff States.  \nB.  Defendants’ removal of any doctor safeguards also contributed \nto  women  receiving  abortion  drugs  out-of-state  and  then \nreturning home with no continuous in-person follow-up care.  \n279.  The removal of the safeguard of a doctor prescriber for FDA-approved \nabortion drugs was likewise a key step in allowing them to be dispensed to women in \none state while leaving follow-up care to the woman’s home state.  \n280.  Three of the plaintiff providers in Whole Woman’s Health v. FDA (Whole \nWoman’s Health, Blue Mountain Clinic, and All Families) employ advanced practice \nclinicians (APCs) to provide chemical abortion drugs.224  \n                                            \n223 Ex. 55, Anna Spoerre, 2 Years After Missouri Banned Abortion, Navigating Access \nStill  Involves  Fear,  Confusion,  Missouri  Independent  (June  24,  2024), \nhttps://missouriindependent.com/2024/06/24/2-year-anniversary-missouri-abortion-\nban/. \n224 Whole Woman’s Health Compl. ¶ 101; Miller Decl. ¶ 18; Smith Decl. ¶ 31. \n69 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z     Document 217     Filed 01/16/25      Page 70 of 199     PageID 12302\n281.  WWH of Alexandria employs a nurse practitioner to dispense abortion \ndrugs in-clinic, and it employed other advanced practice clinicians in the past.225 The \nclinic estimates that its “nurse practitioners have provided around 1,500 medication \nabortions, which is more than 40% of the total medication abortions.”226  \n282.  WWH  of  Alexandria  credits  the  FDA’s  removal  of  the  prior  doctor \nprotections for its ability to provide more abortions. WWH of Alexandria “only has \nphysicians  providing  abortion  Thursday  through  Saturday,  so  employing  APCs \nallows the clinic to offer abortions for the rest of the week and frees up clinic space \nand  resources  for  later  abortion  cases  over  the  weekend.”227  Reinstating  the \nphysician-only certified prescriber requirement would complicate WWH’s operations \nand recruiting of APCs...”228  \n283.  One provider in Montana, All Families (which is close to the border with \nIdaho) says that this FDA deregulation is the only way that it can provide abortion \ndrugs. “In the case of All Families, the sole clinician prescribing and providing \nabortion is an advanced practice clinician. Reinstating the REMS’ physician-only \nrequirement  for  certified  prescribers  will  thus  eliminate  the  sole  mifepristone \nprovider from the northwest region of Montana.”229 In Montana the next closest \nprovider, Blue Mountain Clinic, is a three-hour drive away.230  \n                                            \n225 Miller Decl. ¶ 18. \n226 Id. ¶ 18. \n227 Id. ¶ 36. “ \n228 Id. ¶ 37. \n229 Whole Woman’s Health Compl. ¶ 102; Weems Decl. ¶¶ 1–2. \n230 Weems Decl. ¶¶ 25, 28; Smith Decl. ¶ 33. \n70 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z     Document 217     Filed 01/16/25      Page 71 of 199     PageID 12303\n284.  All Families provides abortion drugs up to 11 weeks of pregnancy.231 In \n2022, it provided approximately 260 abortions, and providing abortion drugs “makes \nup well over half” of these abortions.232 The next year, abortion drugs made up \n“between 65% and 90%” of total monthly abortions in 2023 at All Families.233  \n285.  For All Families, restoring the pre-2016 REMS would be “devastating” \nfor its operations.234 Reinstating “the physician-only certified prescriber requirement \nwould  mean  [it]  could  no  longer  prescribe  mifepristone.”235  “Advanced  practice \nclinicians have been critical to maintaining or restoring access to abortion in this \nregion—including access to mifepristone—and this requirement would once again cut \noff that access.”236  \n286.  At Blue Mountain Clinic, two physician assistants likewise dispense \nabortion drugs, and Blue Mountain Clinic brought suit to maintain this status quo.237  \n287.  The other providers in Whole Woman’s Health Alliance v. FDA similarly \nseek to use non-doctors to provide abortion drugs. WWH of Charlottesville does not \ncurrently  have  any  advanced  practice  clinicians  providing  abortion  care  but  is \nactively recruiting for such providers.238 Trust Women in Kansas likewise “would \nwant to use advanced practice clinicians to mail chemical abortion drugs if they are \nultimately able to start their telehealth program.”239  \n                                            \n231 Weems Decl. ¶ 6. \n232 Id. \n233 Id. \n234 Id. ¶ 24. \n235 Id. ¶ 25. \n236 Id. ¶ 26. \n237 Smith Decl. ¶ 31. \n238 Miller Decl. ¶ 11. \n239 Whole Woman’s Health Compl. ¶ 101; Tong Decl. ¶ 27.  \n71 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z     Document 217     Filed 01/16/25      Page 72 of 199     PageID 12304\n288.  The FDA’s actions directly led to the ability of these abortion providers \nto dispense abortion drugs or to dispense more abortion drugs to women from Plaintiff \nStates, and the FDA’s action directly increased harm to women and girls.  \nC.  The FDA’s pharmacy deregulation likewise leads to abortions \nwith no in-person follow-up care.   \n289.  Defendants’  pharmacy  dispensing  deregulation  also  has  major \nimplications for Plaintiff States. This action also enabled abortion providers in other \nStates to dispense abortion drugs (or dispense more abortion drugs) to women from \nPlaintiff States and then send them home for follow-up care in Plaintiff States.  \n290.  The FDA’s permission for pharmacies to dispense abortion drugs led \nmajor pharmacy chains to start stocking abortion drugs in many states—without \nproviding in-person follow-up care.  \n291.  Walgreens and CVS each swiftly announced that they “will sell the \nprescription abortion pill mifepristone after the Food and Drug Administration this \nweek dropped a long-standing rule that prevented drug stores from doing so.”240 As \none article explained, “This means patients in many parts of the U.S. will effectively \nbe able to obtain mifepristone like other prescription medications, either in-person at \na retail pharmacy or through the mail.”241 In early 2024, both “major pharmacy \nchains CVS and Walgreens announced they had been certified to begin dispensing \nmifepristone at select locations in states where abortion is legal.”242  \n                                            \n240 Ex. 56, Spencer Kimball & Bertha Coombs, CVS and Walgreens Plan to Sell \nAbortion Pill Mifepristone at Pharmacies after FDA Rule Change, CNBC (Jan. 5 \n2023),  https://www.cnbc.com/2023/01/05/abortion-cvs-and-walgreens-will-sell-\nmifepristone-in-pharmacies.html.  \n241 Id.  \n242 Ex. 57, Patrick Adams, In Washington State, Pharmacists are Poised to Start \nPrescribing  Abortion  Drugs,  NPR  (March  1,  2024), \n72 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z     Document 217     Filed 01/16/25      Page 73 of 199     PageID 12305\n292.  In March 2024, Walgreens announced that “it will begin dispensing \nmifepristone pills within a week — consistent with state laws — in select locations in \nCalifornia, Illinois, Massachusetts, New York and Pennsylvania.”243 \n293.  GenBioPro’s website reports that CVS Pharmacy now likewise provides \nabortion drugs in California, Colorado, Connecticut, DC, Delaware, Hawai’i, Illinois, \nMassachusetts,  Maryland,  Maine,  Michigan,  Minnesota,  New  Hampshire,  New \nJersey,  Nevada,  New  Mexico,  New  York,  Oregon,  Pennsylvania,  Rhode  Island, \nVirginia, Vermont, and Washington.244 \n294.  Another  national  pharmacy  dispensing  abortion  drugs  is  Honeybee \nHealth,  which  GenBioPro  reports  provides  abortion  drugs  by  mail  “in  multiple \nstates.”245  \n295.  Smaller pharmacies are now dispensing abortion drugs, too. GenBioPro \nidentifies smaller or regional pharmacies that dispense its abortion drugs in Arizona, \nCalifornia,  Connecticut,  Maryland,  Nevada,  New  York,  Rhode  Island,  South \nCarolina, Texas, Washington, and Wisconsin.246  \n296.  As NPR has reported, “Over the past several months, a handful of \ncommunity pharmacies in states where abortion remains legal have begun to take \nadvantage of a new rule that allows them to fill prescriptions for the abortion pill \nmifepristone.

This will likely increase \nfurther the number of women with no follow-up care who seek emergency services in \nPlaintiff States.  \n297.  In fact, in Washington, pharmacists “go a step further than that” and \n“pharmacists  themselves  [now]  prescribe  the  abortion  medication,  without  a \nphysician.”248 In Washington, “efforts are underway to open up access to medication \nabortion in a radical new way: by training pharmacists not only to dispense abortion \npills but also to prescribe them to their walk-in patients.”249 NPR reports that “[t]here \nare 10 pharmacists in the first cohort,” expected to start prescribing in early 2024.250  \n298.  Without  the  FDA’s  in-person  dispensing  protection  or  without  any \ndoctor  safeguards,  a  pharmacist  in  Washington  can  now  conduct  a  telehealth \nappointment with an Idaho resident in Washington and prescribe mifepristone. As \nNPR concludes, “Pharmacist prescribing of mifepristone puts the drug a step closer \nto over-the-counter.”251  \n                                            \n247 Id.  \n248 Ex. 57, Patrick Adams, In Washington State, Pharmacists are Poised to Start \nPrescribing  Abortion  Drugs,  NPR  (March  1,  2024), \nhttps://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2024/01/22/1225703970/pharmacists-\nprescribe-dispense-abortion-pill-mifepristone. \n249 Id.  \n250 Id.  \n251 Id.  \n74 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z     Document 217     Filed 01/16/25      Page 75 of 199     PageID 12307\n299.  The new ability of pharmacists to prescribe and dispense abortion drugs \nshows how women from Plaintiff States will be harmed by the FDA’s actions and seek \nfollow-up care from providers at home.  \nD.  Defendants’ actions resulted in the creation of a 50-state mail-\norder abortion-drug economy.  \n300.  Lifting any in-person dispensing protections —no matter the risk to \nwomen’s health and safety—was the final step in the FDA’s plan to limit any effect \nfrom Dobbs and undermine state abortion laws.  \n301.  Removing the in-person dispensing protections enabled a 50-state mail-\norder abortion drug economy—a world where countless women in Plaintiff States \nreceive abortion drugs by mail later in pregnancy with no in-person care and go the \nemergency room in Plaintiffs’ States.  \n302.  According to one report, in less than a month after Dobbs was decided, \nseven U.S.-based providers mailed approximately 3,500 doses of mifepristone and its \ngeneric equivalent to states that prohibit the use of abortion drugs.252  \n303.  Eight States have embraced Defendants’ actions and passed “shield” \nlaws expressly seeking to facilitate these providers conducting out-of-state mail-order \nabortions and to prevent Plaintiff States from enforcing their own laws.253 \n                                            \n252 Ex. 60, Rachel Roubein, ‘Shield’ Laws Make it Easier to Send Abortion Pills to \nBanned  States,  Wash.

These shield laws often explicitly name mifepristone and the proponents \nof those laws openly proclaim that they seek to abrogate the sovereignty of Plaintiff \nStates.254 \n1.  Aid Access  \n305.  Many abortion providers, like Aid Access, have explained to the press \nhow Defendants’ actions have enabled them to frustrate state abortion restrictions \nand mail FDA-approved abortion drugs “to people in all 50 states, even those [like \nMissouri] that have banned it.”255 \n306.  Mailing FDA-approved abortion drugs is new for Aid Access. In the past, \nAid Access did not mail FDA-approved abortion drugs.  \n307.  When Aid Access was started in 2018, it operated as a black-market \nprovider  of  abortion  drugs  from  India.  “FDA  regulations  prevented  licensed  US \nproviders from mailing mifepristone, one of the two drugs in the medication abortion \nregimen, so Aid Access was structured like … telemedicine service.”256 \n308.  But  then  in  2021  the  “in-person  dispensing  requirement  for \nmifepristone” was removed.257 Aid Access responded to the FDA’s 2021 change by \nentering the U.S. market as a provider of FDA-approved abortion drugs by mail in \ncertain states. “For the first time, legally prescribed medication abortion could be put \nin the mail. Aid Access used this opportunity to implement a hybrid model: in states \n                                            \n254 Id.  \n255 Ex. 62, Rebecca Grant, Group Using ‘Shield Laws’ to Provide Abortion Care in \nStates  That  Ban  It,  The  Guardian  (July  23,  2023), \nhttps://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/23/shield-laws-provide-abortion-care-\naid-access. \n256 Id. \n257 Id. \n76 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z     Document 217     Filed 01/16/25      Page 77 of 199     PageID 12309\nwhere telemedicine abortion was legal, US clinicians handled the prescriptions, while \nin states where it wasn’t, the pills continued to be mailed from India.”258 \n309.  Later, after the FDA’s 2023 permanent removal of in-person dispensing \nsafeguards,  Aid  Access  expanded  its  scope  and  began  providing  FDA-approved \nabortion drugs by mail to all states.  \n310.  Once some States like New York adopted shield-laws, Aid Access began \nmailing FDA-approved abortion drugs directly from the United States instead of \nblack-market abortion drugs from India.  \n311.  This change transformed the process from “needing to wait three or four \nweeks to get it to happen, and not even be sure if those pills are ever going to come” \nto receiving abortion drugs in the mail in “two-five days.” 259 \n312.  The  FDA’s  decision  not  to  require  in-person  distribution  directly \ncontributed to the decisions of out-of-state companies to mail abortion drugs to people \nin Plaintiff States. People “feel more secure knowing that the pills are coming from \nlicensed clinicians through an FDA-approved pipeline” rather than from India.260 \n313.  In an NBC news story, Dr. Linda Prine, a New York City-based shield \nlaw provider for Aid Access explained the scale of its new FDA-enabled mailing \noperations by mid-2024. “Before we had the shield law, we were mailing pills to the \nblue states, and only [pills from] overseas could be sent to the restricted states.” After \nNew York’s shield law passed, Aid Access began sending FDA-approved abortion \n                                            \n258 Id. \n259 Id. \n260 Id. \n77 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z     Document 217     Filed 01/16/25      Page 78 of 199     PageID 12310\ndrugs to every state: “the first month we sent about 4,000 pills into restricted states, \nand now we’re up to around 10,000 pills a month.”261 \n314.  Another Aid Access provider, located in “a basement in upstate New \nYork” also “underscored the importance of sending these pills from the U.S., rather \nthan overseas. ‘Sometimes they got stuck in customs,’ the provider explained as more \nthan 100 prescriptions were being packaged around them, preparing to be shipped \ninto states with bans.”262 \n315.  Aid Access moreover benefits from Defendants’ removal of the safeguard \nthat women receive a doctor’s care when receiving FDA-approved abortion drugs. \nAlongside  doctors,  Lauren  Jacobson,  a  nurse  practitioner,  prescribes  abortion \nmedication through Aid Access—helping make Aid Access the largest of the current \nshield law abortion drug providers.263 \n316.  The NBC story provided images of New York’s Aid Access providers \nmailing GenBioPro’s generic mifepristone to women in Plaintiff States—the images \nshow that next to pill bottles and mailing envelopes, these abortion providers have \nstacks of white boxes of mifepristone with GenBioPro’s distinctive purple and pink \ncircular logo.264  \n                                            \n261  Ex.  63,  Abigail  Brooks  and  Dasha  Burns,  How  A  Network  of  Abortion  Pill \nProviders Works Together in the Wake of New Threats, NBC News (April 7, 2024), \nhttps://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/network-abortion-pill-providers-\nworks-together-wake-new-threats-rcna146678.  \n262 Id. \n263 Ex. 64, Elissa Nadworny, Inside a Medical Practice Sending Abortion Pills to \nStates  Where  They’re  Banned,  NPR  (Aug.  7,  2024), \nhttps://www.npr.org/2024/08/06/nx-s1-5037750/abortion-pills-bans-telehealth-mail-\nmifepristone-misoprostol.  \n264 Ex. 63, Abigail Brooks and Dasha Burns, How a Network of Abortion Pill Providers \nWorks  Together  in  the  Wake  of  New  Threats,  NBC  News  (April  7,  2024), \n78 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z     Document 217     Filed 01/16/25      Page 79 of 199     PageID 12311\nA shield law provider packs abortion pills into envelopes to be sent from New York to \nstates with bans.

Dr. Prine said that when someone calls her by phone for advice, she tells \nwomen who call concerned about complications “that their experiences are nothing \nout of the ordinary, and that they almost certainly don’t need to go to the emergency \nroom.”270  \n321.  Dr. Prine “said she’s felt the need to send someone to the emergency \nroom only once in nearly five years … ‘Your uterus knows what to do,’ Prine told a \nwoman  who  called  that  January  morning  with  reports  of  unexpectedly  heavy \nbleeding. ‘It’s going to take care of itself.’”271  \n                                            \n266 Id. \n267 Ex. 66, Caroline Kitchener, Alone in a Bathroom: The Fear and Uncertainty of a \nPost-Roe  Medication  Abortion  (April  11,  2024), \nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/interactive/2024/abortion-pill-experience-\nstories/?itid=ap_carolinekitchener. \n268 Id.  \n269 Id.  \n270 Id.  \n271 Id.  \n82 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z     Document 217     Filed 01/16/25      Page 83 of 199     PageID 12315\n322.  The Washington Post shared Dr. Prine’s comments with other doctors. \nIt reported, “A woman in that situation could have hemorrhaged or become septic, \naccording to five OB/GYNs interviewed for this article.”272  \n323.  Keri Garel, an OB/GYN at Boston Medical Center, said, “Whenever \nthere is something inside the uterus that is trying to come out and won’t come out, \nthe risk of bleeding and infection gets higher with every passing moment,” and so she \nwould advise someone in [this woman’s] situation to go to the hospital immediately. \n“At that point, your life is the most important thing.” \n324.  Aid Access will provide abortion drugs to a woman or girl of any age.273   \n325.  Dr. Prine described how once a “quiet and scared” girl who was 15 years \nold called her from “an area code in a state with an abortion ban” desperate for help \nafter she “had taken pills and passed a fetus larger than she’d expected.” The article \nrelates, “Unable to flush the fetus down the toilet, the girl asked about throwing it \naway.” Dr. Prine’s main response: “There’s nothing in there that’s traceable back to \nyou … As long as you don’t tell anybody.”274 \n326.  Ms. Jacobson conceded to the Washington Post “that this system is far \nfrom perfect.” And she admitted to “occasions her patients in restricted states require \nin-person care” that she would not provide.275  \n327.

MAP does not conduct in-person exams on patients or provide in-person \nfollow-up care. Instead, women “can fill out an online form, connect with a doctor via \nemail or text and, if approved, receive the pills within a week, no matter which state \nthey live in.”288 MAP’s review of a woman’s online submission can occur “within an \nhour” and the whole process can take only three hours before MAP mails the abortion \ndrugs at the post office. 289 Occasionally some women “talk by phone with [Dr. Angel] \nFoster or a prescriber.”290 \n339.

Abuzz  provides  abortion  drugs  to  Missouri,  Idaho,  and  Kansas \naddresses, and it mails to every State except Texas, Mississippi, Alabama, and \nGeorgia.305 It provides abortion drugs through 10 weeks of pregnancy and beyond.306 \n352.  Abuzz’s website states that it does not provide in-person care. Instead, \nAbuzz says, “In most cases, providers do not require a phone call or video visit.

In response to the \nquestion, “If I have to go to the hospital, what should I say?” Abuzz says, “The \ntreatment for a miscarriage and abortion are the same, so you can just say something \nlike ‘I’m bleeding but it doesn’t feel like my usual period.

We Take Care of Us describes itself as “a cooperative run by Certified \nNurse  Midwives  (CNMs),”  indicating  that  the  FDA’s  removal  of  any  doctor \ninvolvement has enabled this platform.315  \n360.  We Take Care of Us tells patients that a “video visit is not required” and \nso it offers to communicate by “secure messaging app, text and email.”316 We Take \nCare of Us requires only a “10-15 minute online intake request.”317  \n361.  We Take Care of Us accepts  payment by Venmo and “can arrange \nshipment to any U.S. state, Guam, Puerto Rico and APO addresses.”318  \n6.  The effect on Plaintiff States \n362.  These providers send abortion drugs to Plaintiff States by mail, common \ncarrier, and interactive computer service.  \n363.  The website Plan C lists websites that will ship FDA-approved abortion \ndrugs to Plaintiff States. Plan C says, “Abortion access in Missouri is restricted, but \nabortion pills are still available by mail from providers outside of Missouri. Options \nbelow.”319 Under a section entitled, “How people get abortion pills in Missouri,” Plan \nC  lists  six  abortion  drug  providers  who  provide  “FDA-approved  medications,” \ndescribing each as “online clinics that mail pills.”  \n364.  Plan C identifies as providers of FDA-approved abortion drugs Abuzz, \nAid Access, Armadillo Clinic, Cambridge Reproductive Health Consultants (MAP), \nWe Take Care of Us, and A Safe Choice.320 In addition, Plan C specifically notes that \n                                            \n315 Ex. 74, We Take Care of Us, FAQs, https://www.wetakecareof.us/faqs. \n316 Id. \n317 Ex. 74a, We Take Care of Us, Care, https://www.wetakecareof.us/care. \n318 Id. \n319 Ex. 75, Plan C, Missouri, https://www.plancpills.org/abortion-pill/missouri.  \n320 Id.  \n96 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z     Document 217     Filed 01/16/25      Page 97 of 199     PageID 12329\nAid Access’s abortion drugs “are prescribed by clinicians licensed in the US and the \nFDA-approved abortion pills are mailed to all states.”321   \n365.  Of these six providers, Abuzz and MAP will mail FDA-approved abortion \ndrugs to Missouri residents aged 16+.322  \n366.  Plan C identifies Abuzz, Aid Access, MAP, We Take Care of Us, and A \nSafe Choice as “online clinics that mail pills” to Idaho323 and Kansas residents, and \nit also identifies Abortion on Demand as a provider for Kansas residents.324 Abuzz \nand MAP will mail FDA-approved abortion drugs to Idaho and Kansas residents aged \n16+.325 \n367.  The FDA has thus facilitated violations of many States’ laws—and has \nleft many women to face complications from abortion drugs with no required in-\nperson care.  \n368.  The  FDA  has  also  created  a  method  to  violate  many  States’  laws \nregarding age restrictions (like Kansas’s) and allowed rapists to hide their actions \nand avoid criminal laws because many drug shippers (A Safe Choice, Aid Access, \nMAP, and We Take Care of Us) do not have a verification mechanism, and those who \ndo (Armadillo Clinic and Abuzz) have only a minimal screening process that are \nunlikely to stop a perpetrator from obtaining chemical abortion drugs. \n369.  Of course, other organizations mail or dispense FDA-approved abortion \ndrugs to Plaintiff States, too.  \n                                            \n321 Id.  \n322 Id. \n323 Ex. 76, Plan C, Idaho, https://www.plancpills.org/abortion-pill/idaho#telehealth. \n324  Ex.  77,  Plan  C,  Kansas,  https://www.plancpills.org/abortion-\npill/kansas#telehealth.  \n325 Id.; Ex. 76, Plan C, Idaho, https://www.plancpills.org/abortion-\npill/idaho#telehealth. \n97 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z     Document 217     Filed 01/16/25      Page 98 of 199     PageID 12330\n370.  For example, Plan C identifies six abortion providers located in Kansas \nthat  may  provide  FDA-approved  abortion  drugs:  Planned  Parenthood  -  Wichita \nHealth Center, Aria Medical, Center for Women’s Health, Planned Parenthood - \nKansas City Health Center, Planned Parenthood - Comprehensive Health Services, \nand Trust Women Wichita.326 \nE.  The lack of in-person dispensing results in women receiving \npills  by  mail  in  one  state  from  brick-and-mortar  abortion \nproviders before returning to Plaintiff States for follow-up care.  \n371.  The FDA’s lifting of the in-person dispensing protection also enabled \nproviders with brick-and-mortar in-person locations to remotely dispense abortion \ndrug.  \n372.  Using the mail or common carrier, abortion providers at these brick-and-\nmortar locations now could add virtual options to their offerings. The FDA’s actions \nenabled them to mail abortion drugs to women up to 10 weeks pregnant from Plaintiff \nStates who traveled to the brick-and-mortar provider’s virtual service area—and then \nsend the women home to Plaintiff States without in-person follow-up care.  \n373.  No brick-and-mortar abortion provider mails to all states. Most mail \nonly to states without abortion restrictions—and they allow any person temporarily \nin those states to order abortion drugs by telehealth and mail before returning to \ntheir home states.  \n374.

Wash. filed Feb. 23, 2023) likewise now provide abortion drugs by mail, common \ncarrier, and interactive computer service in many states to women from Plaintiff \nStates—expanding the number of women receiving abortion drugs with no in-person \ncare who seek emergency rooms in Plaintiff States. (This virtual option is in addition \nto their in-person option for women who receive abortion drugs in person at their \nbrick-and-mortar locations.) \n376.  For example, WWH of Alexandria operates via telehealth, and Whole \nWoman’s Health of the Twin Cities, LLC, has operated a virtual program since \nAugust of 2021 that provides abortion drugs by telehealth in Virginia, Maryland, \nMinnesota,  New  Mexico,  and  Illinois.329  This  virtual  brick-and-mortar  program \nprovides medication abortion to approximately 2,400 patients per year, and the \nmajority of those patients seek telehealth in Virginia. It estimates that “[a]round half \nof our virtual patients live in the states where we provide telehealth, while the other \nhalf travel to those states from other places.”330 “Many patients require funding to \n                                            \n327 Ex. 79, Hey Jane, About Us, https://www.heyjane.com/about-us. \n328 Ex. 63, Abigail Brooks and Dasha Burns, How a Network of Abortion Pill Providers \nWorks  Together  in  the  Wake  of  New  Threats,  NBC  News  (April  7,  2024), \nhttps://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/network-abortion-pill-providers-\nworks-together-wake-new-threats-rcna146678. \n329 Ex. 51, Miller Decl. ¶ 20. \n330 Id.¶ 22. \n99 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z     Document 217     Filed 01/16/25      Page 100 of 199     PageID 12332\npay for their telehealth abortion, both for the visit and any associated travel to the \nstates where telehealth is available.”331  \n377.  Whole Woman’s Health is clear that FDA deregulation is essential to \nthis mail-order brick-and-mortar business model: “The optimal use of telehealth in \nthe  provision  of  abortion  care,  however,  depends  on  the  ability  to  dispense \nmifepristone remotely. Because the REMS still prohibit clinicians from writing a \nprescription for mifepristone, the only remote option for distribution of mifepristone \nis by mail.”332 “If clinicians are required to dispense mifepristone in person, their \npatients are forced to travel to the clinic to pick up the medication, even if doing so \nrequires significant travel and other logistical challenges.”333 So, when the FDA \nremoved in-person dispensing protection, “[f]or WWH and our patients, this change \nin the REMS was huge. It allowed us to build out our telehealth practice and begin \nworking with a mail order pharmacy to dispense mifepristone.”334  \n378.  The lack of an in-person dispensing protection allowed Whole Woman’s \nHealth to dispense drugs to women from States that prohibit abortion. As Whole \nWoman’s Health explains, after the REMS change, “WWH’s Virtual Program has \nbeen critical in allowing WWH to meet the demand for abortions from patients \ntraveling from states where abortion is now banned.”335 \n379.  The 2023 REMS change allows Whole Woman’s Health to dispense \nabortion drugs from New Mexico to Texas women. “[E]xpanding our virtual program \nto New Mexico allowed us to continue seeing patients traveling from Texas, even after \n                                            \n331 Id.  \n332 Id.¶ 38. \n333 Id. ¶ 39. \n334 Id. ¶¶ 40–41. \n335 Id. ¶ 42. \n100 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z     Document 217     Filed 01/16/25      Page 101 of 199     PageID 12333\nour Texas clinics were forced to close.”336 “Even though we now have a clinic site in \nNew Mexico, almost all of our patients seeking telehealth in New Mexico travel from \nout of state.”337 “The virtual program allows patients to reduce their travel time and \nexpense and helps ease clinic congestion.”338 “This is particularly important because \nthe New Mexico clinics, who have been inundated with patients traveling from out of \nstate  since  Roe  v.  Wade  was  overturned,  often  have  a  3-week  wait  for \nappointments.”339 The 2023 REMS change thus “is critical to the care of our patients, \nthe sustainability of our medical clinics, and the retention of our clinicians and \nstaff.”340 “Telehealth has been instrumental in allowing clinics to meet the demand \nfor abortions.”341  \n380.  Blue Mountain Clinic similarly credits the FDA’s actions with its ability \nto dispense drugs from its brick-and-mortar location remotely and by mail so long as \na person comes within Montana’s borders. It explains: “Accessing medication abortion \nvia direct-to-patient telehealth can be the difference between accessing abortion care \nor not. Reinstating a ban on dispensing mifepristone by mail would take mifepristone \noff the table as an option for these patients, who otherwise may be unable to make \nthe in-person visit for a procedural abortion.”342 \n                                            \n336 Id. ¶ 43. \n337 Id. \n338 Id. \n339 Id. \n340 Id. ¶ 47. \n341 Id. ¶ 32. \n342 Ex. 49, Smith Decl. ¶ 30. \n101 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z     Document 217     Filed 01/16/25      Page 102 of 199     PageID 12334\n381.  All Families also dispenses abortion drugs remotely and by mail from \nits brick-and-mortar location to patients physically present in Montana.343 More than \nhalf of its abortions are by abortion drugs and more than half of its abortion drugs \nare dispensed by mail.344  \n382.  Just  like  the  other  providers,  All  Families  points  to  the  FDA  as \nresponsible for this virtual “expansion,” which it said “opened up when a court order \nblocked the FDA from enforcing the in-person dispensing requirement in 2020” and \nwhen the “FDA then temporarily suspended the requirement in 2021 and solidified \nthat by updating the REMS in 2023 to eliminate this requirement.”345  \n383.  In  much  the  same  way,  PPGWNI  dispenses  abortion  drugs  via \ntelehealth and by mail to patients in Washington, allowing it to expand its operations \nfor  Idaho  residents  and  other  non-Washington  residents.346  PPGWNI  was  thus \n“grateful for the removal of the in-person requirement with the FDA’s recent updates \nto REMS for mifepristone.”347  \n384.  The above abortion providers from Whole Woman’s Health v. FDA348 and \nWashington v. FDA349 continue to provide abortion drugs by telehealth, mail, common \ncarrier, or other remote means to this day from their brick-and-mortar locations—\nfurther increasing the harms caused by abortion drugs.  \n                                            \n343 Ex. 50, Weems Decl. ¶ 6. \n344Id. ¶ 31. \n345 Id. \n346 Ex. 53, Dillon Decl. ¶ 20. \n347 Id. ¶ 23. \n348 No. 3:23-cv-00019-NKM, ¶1 (W.D.

Trust Women Wichita furthermore now intends to provide abortion \ndrugs through the Internet and by mail or common carrier.350 Until 2018, Trust \nWomen Wichita offered a telemedicine clinic for medication abortion,” but it was \n“forced to stop that practice due to a Kansas state law.”351 But “[t]hat law was very \nrecently enjoined.”352 So it is “particularly interested in pursuing the option to mail \nmifepristone, which would greatly expand our ability to help patients.”353 “We would \nstart as soon as we can if mifepristone remains available and possible to dispense by \ndirect to patient telehealth.”354  \n386.  In sum, in the words of all the brick-and-mortar abortion providers in \nWhole  Woman’s  Health  Alliance  v.  FDA,  “Medication  abortion,  and  specifically, \nprovision  of  mifepristone  by  advanced  practice  clinicians  (including  nurse \npractitioners and physician assistants) and the availability of medication abortion by \nmail (‘direct to patient telehealth’) has been critical” to their ability to dispense \nabortion drugs without follow-up care. Complaint, ECF No. 1, Whole Woman’s Health \nAll. v. FDA, No. 3:23-cv-00019-NKM, ¶ 2 (May 8, 2023) (hereinafter Whole Woman’s \nHealth Compl.). \nF.  The  FDA  predictably  enabled  this  50-state  abortion  drug \neconomy.  \n387.  These “third parties [have] react[ed] in predictable ways” to the FDA’s \ndecisions, and therefore their actions are causally tied to the FDA’s decisions. Dep’t \nof Com. v. New York, 139 S. Ct. 2551, 2566 (2019).  \n                                            \n350 Ex. 48, Tong Decl. ¶ 9. \n351 Id. \n352 Id. \n353 Id. \n354 Id. \n103 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z     Document 217     Filed 01/16/25      Page 104 of 199     PageID 12336\n388.  The FDA enabled the remote dispensing of abortion drugs into all 50 \nStates. When the FDA unlawfully removed its prohibition against mailing abortion \ndrugs, it was predictable that private parties would start mailing those drugs.  \n389.  A decision from this Court would redress this effect. As several abortion \nproviders  explained  in  Whole  Woman’s  Health  v.  FDA,  “reinstating  the  REMS \nrequirement  that  mifepristone  be  dispensed  only  in  a  clinic,  medical  office,  or \nhospital—and not via mail-order pharmacy—will eliminate abortion access for the \nlarge number of patients who have come to rely on direct to patient telehealth \nservices.”  Whole  Woman’s  Health  Compl.  ¶103.  Likewise,  as  GenBioPro  itself \nexplained in this case, “under the pre-2016 conditions … telemedicine providers and \nmail-order pharmacies constituting a substantial proportion of GenBioPro’s customer \nbase will no longer be able to prescribe or dispense GenBioPro’s product.”355 \n390.  At issue in this case are organizations mailing FDA-approved abortion \ndrugs; they differ from so-called black-market organizations that mail non-FDA-\napproved drugs.  \n391.  Plan C for instance identifies 14 websites that sell pills to Missouri, \nIdaho, and Kansas residents without a clinician as well as community networks that \nmail pills to Missouri, Idaho, and Kansas residents: Pill Pulse, Life Easy on Pills, \nHome AbortionRx, Private Emma, Medside 24, Home Abortion PillsRx, YBYCMeds, \nPrivacy Pill RX, Safe Pharmacy, Abortion Pills Rx, Generic Abortion Pills, Abortion \nRx, Online Abortion Pill Rx, and Abortion Privacy.356 Others exist, too. These smaller-\nscale black-market groups each provide abortion pills that Plan C does not describe \n                                            \n355 Amic. Br. GenBioPro, Inc., FDA v.

Just as Aid Access used to mail abortion drugs that were not FDA-\napproved,  these  providers  still  mail  drugs  from  other  countries  like  India  or \nKazakhstan from manufacturers based in China, Russia, Vietnam, Africa, or other \nunknown locations.358  \n393.  The mailing of drugs that are not FDA-approved is not at issue in this \ncase as these drugs are not attributable to the challenged FDA actions. \nXIX.  Plaintiff  States’  residents  are  receiving  abortion  drugs  in  the \nabsence of FDA’s past safeguards.  \n394.  Defendants’  actions  have  resulted  in  abortion  drugs  being  given  to \nwomen in Plaintiffs’ States by abortion providers—just as the abortion providers \nreport and as the FDA intended.  \nA.  Harm to women in Plaintiff States from the FDA’s deregulation \nof abortion drugs \n395.  Many  women  in  Plaintiff  States  have  been  harmed  by  the  FDA’s \nderegulation of abortion drugs.  \n1.  Harms caused by the FDA’s deregulation of abortion drugs \n396.  Dr. Ingrid Skop has “often treat[ed] patients who are admitted through \nthe hospital’s emergency department with complications from chemical abortions.”359 \n                                            \n357 Id.  \n358 Ex. 81, Dominique Mosbergen and Vibhuti Agarwal, Websites Selling Unapproved \nAbortion  Pills  Are  Booming,  Wall  Street  Journal  (Aug.  21,  2022), \nhttps://www.wsj.com/articles/websites-selling-unapproved-abortion-pills-are-\nbooming-11661079601.  \n359 Ex. 82, Skop Decl. ¶ 12.  \n105 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z     Document 217     Filed 01/16/25      Page 106 of 199     PageID 12338\n397.  Dr. Skop is a board-certified OB/GYN with privileges in the Baptist \nHospital System and a 25-year career in clinic and hospital care.360 \n398.  In her words, she has “cared for several dozen women in the emergency \ndepartment who were totally unprepared for the pain and bleeding they experienced \ndue to chemical abortion.”361  \n399.  She has “treated patients who have experienced trauma and emotional \ndistress  because  of  complications  from  chemical  abortion.”362  From  what  she \nobserved,  “[t]hose  women  were  not  anticipating  that  complications  were \npossible[.]”363 At least a dozen patients have expressed to her significant emotional \ndistress “when they viewed the body of their unborn child in the toilet after the \nchemical abortion.”364 \n400.  In her experience, “the doctors who prescribed or administered chemical \nabortion drugs to these women often did not adequately prepare them for the drugs’ \neffects, so these women could not have truly achieved informed consent.”365  \n401.  Dr. Skop has “cared for at least a dozen women who have required \nsurgery to remove retained pregnancy tissue after a chemical abortion. Sometimes \nthis includes the embryo or fetus, and sometimes it is placental tissue that has not \nbeen completely expelled.”366  \n                                            \n360 Id. ¶¶ 2, 6. \n361 Id. ¶ 13.  \n362 Id. ¶ 16.  \n363 Id. \n364 Id. ¶ 15.  \n365 Id. ¶ 14.  \n366 Id. ¶ 17.  \n106 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z     Document 217     Filed 01/16/25      Page 107 of 199     PageID 12339\n402.  Dr. Skop has “cared for approximately five women who, after a chemical \nabortion, have required admission for a blood transfusion or intravenous antibiotics \nor both.”367 \n403.  She reports that the “FDA's actions in 2016 and 2021 have increased the \nfrequency of complications from chemical abortion. Given my experience, I expect to \nsee and treat more patients presenting with complications from chemical abortion.”368  \n404.  “For example, in one month while covering the emergency room, my \ngroup practice admitted three women to the hospital. Of the three women admitted \nin one month due to chemical abortion complications, one required admission to the \nintensive  care  unit  for  sepsis  and  intravenous  antibiotics,  one  required  a  blood \ntransfusion for hemorrhage, and one required surgical completion for the retained \nproducts of conception (i.e., the doctors had to surgically finish the abortion with a \nsuction aspiration procedure).”369 \n405.  In another example, in her office, Dr. Skop “treated one young woman \nwho had been bleeding for six weeks after she took the chemical abortions drugs given \nto her by a doctor at a Planned Parenthood clinic. After two follow-ups at Planned \nParenthood,  during  which  she  was  given  additional  misoprostol  but  not  offered \nsurgical completion, she presented to me for help. I performed a sonogram, identified \na significant amount of pregnancy tissue remaining in her uterus, and performed a \nsuction aspiration procedure to resolve her complication.” 370 \n                                            \n367 Id. ¶ 18.  \n368 Id. ¶¶ 20–21.  \n369 Id. ¶ 22.  \n370 Id. ¶ 23.  \n107 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z     Document 217     Filed 01/16/25      Page 108 of 199     PageID 12340\n406.  Dr. Skop has also cared for minor women below the age of 18 who have \nobtained abortion drugs.371  \n407.  In Dr. Skop’s experience, “[t]he FDA’s actions harm women, including \n[her] patients, because without proper oversight, chemical abortions can become even \nmore dangerous than when they are supervised.”372  \n408.  The many “clinics and physicians prescribing or dispensing chemical \nabortion drugs, or websites that provide these drugs through mail order delivery \nwithout any physician involvement, often underprepare women for the severity and \nrisks of chemical abortion, and they often provide insufficient or no follow-up care to \nthose women.”373 \n409.  “Many women are inadequately prepared for the effects of the drugs, the \nseverity of the pain and bleeding they will experience, the human tissue they will \nexpel, and some are unaware that they have complicating factors such as ectopic \nimplantation, more advanced gestation than estimated, and Rh-negative blood type. \nThese patients are being abandoned because in many cases there is no doctor-patient \nrelationship, so they often present to overwhelmed emergency rooms in their distress, \nwhere they are usually cared for by physicians other than the abortion prescriber.”374 \n410.  In particular, Dr. Skop notes that “approximately 2% of pregnancies are \nectopic pregnancies, implanted outside of the uterine cavity. Chemical abortion drugs \nwill not effectually end an ectopic pregnancy because they exert their effects on the \n                                            \n371 Id. ¶ 24.  \n372 Id. ¶ 26.  \n373 Id. ¶ 27.  \n374 Id. \n108 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z     Document 217     Filed 01/16/25      Page 109 of 199     PageID 12341\nuterus, which leaves women at risk of severe harm from hemorrhage due to tubal \nrupture, in need of emergent surgery or potentially at risk of death.”375 \n2.  Care provided by Dr. Shaun Jester demonstrates harms \ncaused by the FDA’s deregulation of abortion drugs \n411.  Dr. Shaun Jester has likewise witnessed harm caused by the lack of \nfollow-up care for women given abortion drugs.376  \n412.  Dr. Jester is a board-certified obstetrician and gynecologist and the \nMedical Director of Moore County Ob/Gyn.377 \n413.  He  has  seen  firsthand  the  harm  the  FDA  caused  by  removing  the \nprotection that an in-person follow-up visit provides.  \n414.  The FDA hurt one of his patients by allowing for abortion drugs to be \ndispensed to her in another state without mandatory follow-up care. As he related, “I \ntreated a woman who traveled from Texas to obtain chemical abortion drugs from \nPlanned Parenthood New Mexico to complete an abortion at 10 weeks' gestation. The \nwoman returned to Texas, suffered from two weeks of moderate to heavy bleeding, \nand  then  developed  a  uterine  infection.  At  the  hospital,  I  provided  her  with \nintravenous antibiotics and performed a dilation and curettage procedure. If she had \nwaited a few more days before receiving care, she could have been septic and died. I \nreported this adverse event to the FDA.”378 \n415.  The FDA’s actions caused this patient to seek care from Dr. Jester in \nher home state of Texas, as there was no requirement for in-person follow-up care \nfrom the abortion provider in New Mexico. As he explains, “In the chemical abortion \n                                            \n375 Id. ¶ 29.  \n376 Ex. 83, Jester Decl. ¶¶ 2, 17. \n377 Id. ¶ 2. \n378 Id. ¶ 17. \n109 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z     Document 217     Filed 01/16/25      Page 110 of 199     PageID 12342\ncase that I reported as an adverse event to the FDA, I had no existing patient \nrelationship or prior knowledge of the patient's medical history.”379 And “it disturbed \nme that she was not informed that it was not normal to bleed for multiple weeks and \nthat if she had a routine follow-up visit, as required by past REMS, this situation \ncould have been avoided before requiring overnight hospitalization and her being at \nrisk for developing sepsis.”380 \n416.  In his experience, “the requirement for an in-person, postabortion office \nvisit, which is when a physician determines whether any fetal parts or other products \nof conception remain [is] essential to ensure that women experience no complications \nafter chemical abortion.”381 “The elimination of mandatory follow-up visits after \nchemical abortion drugs have been administered is … dangerous … Without follow-\nup  visits,  physicians  cannot  identify  potential  complications  like  sepsis  and \nhemorrhage, lingering products of conception, and others until the patient is at a \ncritical time or it is too late to help the patient.”382 \nB.  State governmental data on women in Plaintiff States receiving \nabortion drugs due to the FDA’s deregulation  \n417.  Data show how many of Plaintiff States’ residents have been receiving \nabortion drugs in the absence of the FDA’s safeguards.  \n418.  At oral argument before the Fifth Circuit, Defendants were asked about \nthe Supreme Court’s ruling that state plaintiffs in Department of Commerce v. New \nYork, 139 S. Ct. 2551 (2019), had standing. The Federal Government responded that, \nin Department of Commerce, “the plaintiffs were states,” meaning “the effects [of \n                                            \n379 Id. ¶ 20. \n380 Id. ¶ 27. \n381 Id. ¶ 10. \n382 Id. ¶ 25. \n110 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z     Document 217     Filed 01/16/25      Page 111 of 199     PageID 12343\nchallenged federal action] on them happened at the population level,” and the States \ncould thus “rely on population-wide statistics and probabilities.” Oral Arg.

Just as in Department of Commerce, population-wide information shows \nthe number of women affected by Defendants’ actions.  \n420.  Under state abortion reporting laws, Plaintiff States’ agencies collect \ndata  on  abortions  performed  on  state  residents.  These  estimates  are  likely  an \nundercount due to reporting inadequacies and missing data, especially in light of the \nhigh rates of chemical abortions nationwide and the known refusal of out-of-state \nproviders to submit information to Plaintiff States or comply with Plaintiffs’ abortion \nlaws. In addition, non-governmental organizations have begun collecting abortion \ndrug data for the years after Dobbs.  \n1.  Missouri’s state abortion data  \n421.

The large number of abortions on Missouri residents by abortion drugs \nin this table includes abortions for Missouri residents who obtained the drugs by from \nout-of-state providers, such as providers in Kansas or Illinois, who were enabled by \nthe FDA’s removal of the requirement for three in-person doctor visits.

Consequently, although the baseline for Missouri residents’ abortions \nvia  abortion  drugs  should  be  zero  from  2019  onwards,  these  figures  show  that \nMissouri residents received at least some abortions from out-of-state providers who \ndispensed abortion drugs in a single visit and then sent women home to Missouri \nwith no in-person follow-up care—all enabled by the FDA’s lack of a requirement for \nthree in-person doctor visits, including a follow-up visit.  \n                                            \n386 Ex. 84, Associated Press, Planned Parenthood in Missouri Disputes Report State \nNo  Longer  Performs  Abortions,  But  Number  of  Procedures  Fell  Due  to  New \nRegulations,  Chicago  Tribune  (Jan.  20,  2021), \nhttps://www.chicagotribune.com/2021/01/20/planned-parenthood-in-missouri-\ndisputes-report-state-no-longer-performs-abortions-but-number-of-procedures-fell-\ndue-to-new-regulations/  (“No  surgical  abortions  were  performed  at  the  clinic  in \nDecember, with only seven in November, Planned Parenthood said, compared with \nnine and five during those months in 2019”).  \n387 Id.  \n388 Id.  \n113 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z     Document 217     Filed 01/16/25      Page 114 of 199     PageID 12346\n2.

This data shows that since each of Defendants’ actions the total number \nof chemical abortions, the total number of abortions in Kansas on non-Kansans, and \nthe number of 9-12 week chemical abortions have all increased—and markedly so in \n2022 the year when Dobbs was announced.   \n433.  In this chart, the totals for out-of-state residents receiving abortion \ndrugs in Kansas includes women from Missouri who received abortion drugs in \nKansas and who then were sent home to Missouri without in-person follow visits—\nleading them to seek follow-up care as needed in Missouri.  \n434.  This governmental data reflects the known sales data of mifepristone. \nBetween 2019 and October 2023, “GenBioPro has marketed and sold approximately \n850,000 units of generic mifepristone throughout the United States.” Am. Compl., \nECF No. 75, GenBioPro, Inc. v. Raynes, No. CV 3:23-0058, at ¶¶ 1 – 2 (S.D .W.Va. \nOct. 19, 2023). \n435.  That being said, these reports and the medical literature underestimate \nabortion  rates  and  abortion  complication  rates:  abortion  providers  systemically \nviolate their duty to report abortions or complications to state governments.  \n117 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z     Document 217     Filed 01/16/25      Page 118 of 199     PageID 12350\n436.  For at least 15 years, abortion providers in Missouri violated a law \nrequiring them to report complications to the state.  \n437.  In sworn testimony, David Eisenberg, then an abortionist in Missouri, \nadmitted that he and other abortionists at his St. Louis clinic refused to file these \nreports even though they knew about the state law requiring the reports.393  \n438.  Colleen  McNicholas,  another  person  who  until  recently  performed \nabortions in Missouri, likewise admitted under oath that she violated this law for \nyears.394  \n439.  There is no reason to think that this systemic failure to file lawfully \nrequired complication reports is limited to Missouri. Those who performed abortions \nin Missouri also perform them elsewhere.  \n440.  Indeed,  Eisenberg  admitted  he  did  not  file  these  reports  at  “other \nhealthcare facilities” where he worked.395 And a news story describes McNicholas as \nan abortionist who “zig-zags across the Midwest,” performing abortions in many \ndifferent states.396  \n441.  Since  Dobbs,  the  lack  of  compliance  with  state  abortion  reporting \nrequirements has increased, and the resulting undercounts in state abortion data \nhave increased, as out-of-state suppliers have stepped into the market with the \npurpose of undermining state abortion laws.  \n                                            \n393 Ex. 85, ECF 48-3, Eisenberg Dep., Doc. 141-4, No. 2:16-cv-04313 (W.D.

Non-governmental data on women in Plaintiff States receiving \nabortion drugs due to the FDA’s deregulation \n442.  The abortion market shifted in 2022, 2023, and 2024 to out-of-state \nsuppliers who do not file these reports—undermining state abortion-drug reporting \nlaws and the completeness of government data.  \n443.  Non-government  parties  provide  the  best  current  estimates  of  the \nnumber of abortion drugs dispensed since 2022 or 2023.  \n444.  This nongovernmental data reflects the effect of Defendants’ actions \nfrom 2021 onwards, when Defendants first enabled abortion drugs to be dispensed \nwithout any in-person dispensing protection.  \n445.  The lack of an in-person dispensing protection in 2021 enabled many \nexisting abortion providers to provide abortion drugs by remote means within their \ncurrent states or regions as an adjunct to their current business operations. \n446.   Most States had various in-state abortion providers. With Roe in effect, \nabortion providers did not identify the same need to ship abortion drugs remotely into \nstates with abortion restrictions as when Roe was overturned.  \n447.  At the time of Dobbs, and continuing today, abortion providers in states \nwith no abortion restrictions have continued to dispense FDA-approved abortion \ndrugs outside of Plaintiff States in-person (as with the 2016 changes) and by mail, \ncommon carrier, or interactive computer service.   \n448.  But, in addition, after Dobbs, when in-state abortion providers exited \nstates  with  abortion  restrictions,  the  lack  of  an  in-person  dispensing  protection \ncaused other abortion providers to provide FDA-approved abortion drugs to women \nin Plaintiff States. They did so by telehealth (websites, video chat, email, phone, or \ntext) and through the mail or by a common carrier.  \n449.  Unlike prior abortion providers who used telehealth, mail, or common \ncarrier in response to Defendants’ 2021 actions as an adjunct to current in-person \n119 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z     Document 217     Filed 01/16/25      Page 120 of 199     PageID 12352\nbusiness  operations,  beginning  in  2023  these  new  abortion  providers’  business \noperations were exclusively by mail or common carrier.  \n450.  These mail-only abortion providers began to avail themselves of the \nFDA’s 2021 and 2023 changes only in mid-2023. Part of the reason for this delay of \none year from Dobbs was to create the infrastructure necessary and another part of \nthe reason for this delay was to lobby states to enact shield laws.  \n451.  By these abortion providers’ own telling, by mid-2023 they had begun \ntheir remote abortion drug shipments in earnest. The number of FDA-approved \nabortion drugs shipped across state lines has increased ever since.  \n452.  The Society of Family Planning's WeCount project aims to measure \nmonthly abortion utilization, nationally and by state, following Dobbs, based on data \nfrom many abortion providers—including data from shield law providers.397  \n453.  Telehealth is driving an increase in the national abortion totals, as the \ntotal abortions nationally was higher in 2024 than it was in 2023 or 2022.398 For \npurposes of this data, a telehealth abortion is when FDA-approved abortion drugs are \n“offered by a clinician through a remote consultation with the patient (via video, \nphone, or messaging)” that results in the drugs being “dispensed via mail.”399  \n454.  Both  in-person  and  telehealth  abortions  are  increasing  in  Kansas. \nTheWeCount reports, “Comparing the first quarter of 2024 with the first quarter of \n2023, the states with the largest increases in the average number of abortions per \n                                            \n397 Ex. 88, Society of Family Planning, #WeCount Report April 2022 to March 2024 \n(August 7, 2024), https://societyfp.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/WeCount-Report-\n7-Mar-2024-data.pdf (hereinafter #WeCount Report).  \n398 Id. at 2–3.  \n399 Id.  \n120 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z     Document 217     Filed 01/16/25      Page 121 of 199     PageID 12353\nmonth include New York (1,357), California (957), Virginia (597), Kansas (503), and \nPennsylvania (430).   \n455.  Among these five states, when comparing the first quarter of 2024 with \nthe first quarter of 2023, the average number of in-person abortions per month \nincreased by 29% in Kansas, 18% in New York, 13% in Virginia, and 4% in California, \nand decreased by 7% in Pennsylvania. The average number of virtual-only telehealth \nabortions was up by 59% in Kansas and 53% in Virginia.”400 \n456.

State-by-state  data  for  telehealth  abortions  for  states  like  Kansas \n(where abortion is not restricted) is broken down by virtual and brick-and-mortar \nproviders.413  \n465.  But WeCount aggregates data for telehealth abortions for states like \nMissouri and Idaho (where abortion is restricted or regulated), so no state-by-state \ndata is available for these states.  \n466.  The WeCount report does not include black-market, non-FDA-approved \nabortion drugs—a category of abortion drugs that are not at issue in this case.  \n467.  WeCount concurs with the widespread reporting that remote dispensing \nof FDA-approved abortion drugs “under shield laws started in June 2023, which \ntriggered their inclusion in #WeCount in July 2023.”414  \n468.  Some abortion providers were mailing black-market abortion drugs “to \nresidents of states with abortion bans, states with 6-week bans, and states with \n                                            \n412 Ex. 88, #WeCount Report, supra note 397, at 26.  \n413 Ex. 89, Society of Family Planning, #WeCount, Tables \nhttps://societyfp.org/research/wecount/ (click download the latest data for excel \nchart). \n414 Ex. 88, #WeCount Report, supra note 397, at 11.  \n124 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z     Document 217     Filed 01/16/25      Page 125 of 199     PageID 12357\nrestrictions on telehealth prior to June 2023, but these occurred outside the formal \nhealthcare system and were not measured by #WeCount.”415 \n469.  WeCount explained that the “[i]ncreased numbers of abortions in states \nthat permit abortion likely represent a combination of two main factors: people \ntraveling from states where they cannot access care, and increased abortions among \nresidents of states where abortion remains legal.”416 “Such volume increases are \nlikely influenced by reductions of barriers to abortion care, including reduced burden \nof cost and travel by use of telehealth, increased financial support for low-income \nabortion seekers, and improved access via care navigation from practical support \ngroups and public health departments.”417 \n470.  The Guttmacher Institute also estimates the current number of FDA-\napproved abortion drugs dispensed by abortion providers in states that do not restrict \nabortion (excluding shield-law providers who send abortion drugs to states where \nabortion is restricted).  \n471.  It  estimates  that  there  were  “approximately  642,700  medication \nabortions in the United States in 2023, accounting for 63% of all abortions in the \nformal health care system.”418 “This is an increase from 2020, when medication \nabortions accounted for 53% of all abortions.”419 \n                                            \n415 Id. at 11.  \n416 Id. at 11.  \n417 Id. at 11.  \n418 Ex. 90, Rachel K.

This rate is shown in the following chart.420 \n \n473.  If the Guttmacher Institute included data from shield law providers, \nthis rate would be even higher.  \n474.  The Guttmacher Institute collects data showing where women travel to \nreceive abortions, including women from Plaintiff States. Although this data may be \nan undercount due to reporting inadequacies, this data shows that women from \nMissouri traveled to Kansas and Illinois; women from Idaho traveled to Oregon, \nUtah,  and  Washington;  and  women  from  Kansas  largely  obtained  abortions  in \n                                            \n420 Id. \n126 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z     Document 217     Filed 01/16/25      Page 127 of 199     PageID 12359\nColorado and Kansas.421 It estimates that the percentage of abortions provided in \nKansas to out-of-state residents has increased from 52% in 2020 to 67% in 2023.422  \n475.  The Guttmacher Institute also estimates that the number of abortion \nproviders offering abortion drugs by video, phone call, text or online platform—and \nmail “increased from 7% of all providers” in 2020 “to 31% in 2022.”423 “Online-only \nclinics, after first appearing as a new type of abortion provider in 2021, accounted for \n8% of all abortions provided within the formal health care system in the first six \nmonths of 2023.”424  \nXX.  State laws prohibit and regulate abortion drugs.  \n476.  Plaintiff States have the sovereign power to enact and enforce abortion \nlaws.  \n477.  State abortion laws serve the important state interests in “respect for \nand preservation of prenatal life at all stages of development, the protection of \nmaternal health and safety; the elimination of particularly gruesome or barbaric \nmedical procedures; the preservation of the integrity of the medical profession; the \nmitigation of fetal pain; and the prevention of discrimination on the basis of race, sex, \nor disability.” Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Org., 597 U.S. 215, 301, (2022).  \n478.  “[F]rom  time  immemorial,”  the  States  have  maintained  primary \nresponsibility for regulating the medical field through their constitutionally reserved \n                                            \n421 Ex. 91, Guttmacher Institute, State Abortion Travel 2023, https://osf.io/k4x7t/ \n(providing excel charts).  \n422  Ex.  92,  Guttmacher  Institute,  Monthly  Abortion  Provision  Study, \nhttps://www.guttmacher.org/monthly-abortion-provision-study#interstate-travel \n(search Kansas).  \n423 Id. \n424 Id. \n127 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z     Document 217     Filed 01/16/25      Page 128 of 199     PageID 12360\npowers to protect their citizens’ health and welfare. Dent v. West Virginia, 129 U.S. \n114, 122 (1889).  \n479.  Each State “has a significant role to play in regulating the medical \nprofession,” Gonzales v. Carhart, 550 U.S. 124, 157 (2007), as well as “an interest in \nprotecting  the  integrity  and  ethics  of  the  medical  profession,”  Washington  v. \nGlucksberg, 521 U.S. 702, 731 (1997). This includes “maintaining high standards of \nprofessional conduct” in the practice of medicine. Barsky v. Bd. of Regents of Univ. of \nN.Y., 347 U.S. 442, 451 (1954). \n480.  The State also “has an interest in protecting vulnerable groups … from \nabuse, neglect, and mistakes,” Glucksberg, 521 U.S. at 731, and in “the elimination \nof particularly gruesome or barbaric medical procedures,” Dobbs, 597 U.S. at 301. It \nis  also  “evident  beyond  the  need  for  elaboration  that  a  State’s  interest  in \n‘safeguarding the physical and psychological well-being of a minor’ is ‘compelling.’” \nNew York v. Ferber, 458 U.S. 747, 756–57 (1982) (quoting Globe Newspaper Co. v. \nSuperior Court, 457 U.S. 596, 607 (1982)). \n481.  To  serve  these  compelling  sovereign  interests,  Plaintiff  States  have \nenacted statutes regulating and, in certain instances, prohibiting, abortion drugs. \n482.  These laws ensure the proper regulation of the practice of medicine and \nthe medical profession but Defendants’ actions undermine all these laws—including \nstate abortion restrictions and state abortion-drug reporting laws.  \n483.  The laws that the FDA likely considers preempted include the following. \n1.  Missouri’s abortion laws \n484.  The  FDA’s  unlawful  actions  threaten  several  laws,  including \n(1) Missouri’s prohibition on abortions “except in cases of medical emergency,” Mo. \nRev. Stat. § 188.017.2; (2) Missouri’s prohibition on providers administering chemical \nabortion drugs without first submitting a sufficient plan to address complications \n128 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z     Document 217     Filed 01/16/25      Page 129 of 199     PageID 12361\nfrom chemical abortions, id. § 188.021.2; (3) Missouri’s regulations passed under \n§ 188.021.2 requiring physicians who perform abortions to prearrange for backup \nphysicians to address complications if needed, 19 C.S.R. 10-15.050; (4) Missouri’s \nrequirement that chemical abortion drugs be dispensed in-person, not through the \nmail, Mo. Rev. Stat. § 188.021.1; (5) Missouri’s requirement that no person shall \nperform an abortion except a physician, Mo. Rev. Stat. § 188.020; and (6) Missouri’s \nrequirement that no person shall perform or induce an abortion (except in a medical \nemergency) unless a physician or qualified professional has explained the general and \nspecific risks to the woman receiving the abortion, Mo. Rev. State. § 188.039.   \n485.  Missouri  law  prohibits  any  abortion  “except  in  cases  of  medical \nemergency.” Mo. Rev. Stat. § 188.017.2.  \n486.  Missouri law also states that no provider can administer a chemical \nabortion drug without first submitting a treatment plan to address complications and \nobtaining approval from the health department of that plan: \nWhen the Food and Drug Administration label of any drug or chemical \nused for the purpose of inducing an abortion includes any clinical study \nin which more than one percent of those administered the drug or \nchemical  required  surgical  intervention  after  its  administration,  no \nphysician may prescribe or administer such drug or chemical to any \npatient without first obtaining approval from the department of health \nand  senior  services  of  a  complication  plan  from  the  physician  for \nadministration of the drug or chemical to any patient.  \nMo. Rev. Stat. § 188.021.2. \n487.  Regulations  passed  under  this  law  require  physicians  who  perform \nabortions to prearrange for backup physicians to address complications if needed. 19 \nC.S.R. 10-15.050. Missouri statutes and regulations require physicians to plan for \nand provide care for abortion complications so that persons receiving abortions are \n129 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z     Document 217     Filed 01/16/25      Page 130 of 199     PageID 12362\nnot forced to go to emergency rooms. See Mo. Rev. Stat. § 188.021.1–.2; 19 C.S.R. 10-\n15-050.  \n488.  But the FDA’s challenged actions cause doctors who live and work in \nPlaintiff States to treat more women and girls who have suffered complications from \nchemical abortion drugs because physicians are not providing follow-up care when \nindividuals experience complications. ECF 176, ¶¶ 363–68.   \n489.  Missouri law includes an in-person dispensing protection for abortion \ndrugs. “When RU-486 (mifepristone) or any drug or chemical is used for the purpose \nof inducing an abortion, the initial dose of the drug or chemical shall be administered \nin the same room and in the physical presence of the physician who prescribed, \ndispensed, or otherwise provided the drug or chemical to the patient.” Mo. Rev. Stat. \n§ 188.021.1.  \n490.  The  in-person  dispensing  protection  ensures  that  physicians  “shall \nmake all reasonable efforts” to ensure patient follow-up, decreasing the chance that \na woman will find herself in an emergency room with a doctor who has no idea what \nhappened. Mo. Rev. Stat. § 188.021.1.  \n491.  Other states have similar protections. See Am. Coll. of Obstetricians & \nGynecologists v. FDA, 467 F. Supp. 3d 282, 286–87 (D. Md. 2020) (collecting laws from \nnine states, including Missouri).  \n492.  Missouri requires the physician to make all reasonable efforts to ensure \nthe patient returns for a follow-up visit after the administration or use of mifepristone \nor any drug or chemical for the purpose of inducing an abortion. Mo. Rev. Stat. § \n188.021.  \n493.  Missouri limits who may induce an abortion. State law restricts any \nperson other than a physician with clinical privileges at a hospital from performing, \ninducing, or attempting to perform or induce an abortion on another, restricts any \nphysician who does not have clinical privileges at a hospital which offers obstetrical \n130 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z     Document 217     Filed 01/16/25      Page 131 of 199     PageID 12363\nor gynecological care located within thirty miles of the location the abortion is to be \nperformed to perform, induce, or attempt to perform or induce an abortion, and \nrestricts any person, except a physician, from performing or inducing an abortion. \nMo. Rev. Stat. § 188.080. No person shall perform or induce an abortion except a \nphysician. Mo. Rev. Stat. § 188.020 \n494.  Missouri requires informed consent and a 72-hour waiting period. Mo. \nRev. Stat. § 188.027. Under this state law, a woman must give her voluntary and \ninformed consent, freely and without coercion, at least 72 hours before an abortion is \nperformed. For consent to be voluntary and informed, a physician must orally inform \nthe woman of the following in person and writing: \n•  the name of the physician performing the abortion; \n•  medically accurate and relevant materials to the decision of whether to undergo \nthe abortion; \n•  a description of the proposed abortion method; \n•  the immediate and long-term medical and psychological risks associated with the \nabortion and medication administered; \n•  the  unborn  child’s  gestational  age  and  anatomical  and  physiological \ncharacteristics of the unborn child; \n•  alternative options to abortion; \n•  the opportunity for the patient to ask questions of the provider regarding the \nprocedure; and \n•  the location of the nearest hospital and where the woman can receive follow-up \ncare by the physician if complications arise. \n131 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z     Document 217     Filed 01/16/25      Page 132 of 199     PageID 12364\n495.  Missouri’s 72-hour waiting period also provides that, except in the case \nof medical emergency, no person shall perform or induce an abortion unless at least \nseventy-two hours beforehand the physician who is to perform or induce the abortion, \na qualified professional, or the referring physician has conferred with the patient and \ndiscussed with her the indicators and contraindicators, and risk factors including any \nphysical, psychological, or situational factors for the proposed procedure and the use \nof medications, including but not limited to mifepristone, in light of her medical \nhistory and medical condition. For an abortion performed or an abortion induced by \na drug or drugs, such conference shall take place at least seventy-two hours prior to \nthe writing or communication of the first prescription for such drug or drugs in \nconnection with inducing an abortion. Only one such conference shall be required for \neach abortion. Mo. Ann. Stat. § 188.039.  \n496.  Missouri  requires  parental  notification  and  consent  for  a  minor’s \nabortion. Mo. Rev. Stat. § 188.028(1)(1) requires the attending physician to secure \ninformed written consent of the minor and one parent or guardian, and the consenting \nparent or guardian of the minor has notified any other custodial parent in writing \nprior  to  securing  the  informed  written  consent  of  the  minor and  one  parent  or \nguardian. \n497.  Missouri  also  has  an  ultrasound  requirement.  Mo.  Rev.  Stat. \n§ 188.027(4). Under this law, the performing physician must provide the woman with \nan opportunity to view an active and free ultrasound and hear the heartbeat of the \nunborn child at least 72 hours before the abortion.  \n498.  Missouri requires abortion facilities to maintain written protocols for \nmedical emergencies and transfer of patients, and grants the department of health to \nadopt rules, regulations, or standards that apply to ambulatory surgical centers and \nabortion facilities. Missouri requires all ambulatory and abortion facilities to obtain \n132 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z     Document 217     Filed 01/16/25      Page 133 of 199     PageID 12365\na license to operate. Mo. Rev. Stat. § 188.015, Mo. Rev. Stat. § 188.215, Mo. Rev. Stat. \n§ 197.225, Mo. Rev. Stat. § 197.205.  \n499.  Missouri  requires  malpractice  insurance:  it  restricts  hospitals  or \nabortion facilities from employing or engaging the services of a person that would \nperform an abortion using any drug or chemical or combination thereof, which may \ncause birth defects, disability, or other injury to a child who survives the abortion if \nthe person does not have insurance. Mo. Rev. Stat. § 188.044 \n500.  Missouri  requires  an  individual  abortion  report  for  each  abortion \nperformed or induced upon a woman to be completed by the physician who performed \nor induced the abortion. This abortion report shall be made part of the medical record \nof the patient of the abortion facility or hospital where the abortion was performed. \nMo. Rev. Stat. § 188.052.  \n2.  Idaho’s abortion laws  \n501.  Idaho abortion laws prohibit abortion except in certain circumstances, \nprohibit anyone other than a physician from performing an abortion, requires in-\nperson exams before any abortion, requires plan for local follow-up care, and requires \nabortions to occur in regulated medical facilities, among other restrictions that the \nFDA likely considers preempted by the REMS.  \n502.  Idaho  law  regulates  abortion-inducing  drugs  like  mifepristone.  See \nIdaho Code §§ 18-602 (recognizing “[t]hat children have a special place in society that \nthe  law  should  reflect”),  18-604(1)  (“Abortion”  means  the  use  of  any  means  to \nintentionally  terminate  the  clinically  diagnosable  pregnancy  of  a  woman  with \nknowledge that the termination by those means will, with reasonable likelihood, \ncause  the  death  of  the  unborn  child”),  18-617  (defining  “Abortifacient”  to  mean \n“mifepristone, misoprostol and/or other chemical or drug dispensed with the intent of \ncausing an abortion as defined in section 18-604(1)”), and 18-622 (“Every person who \n133 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z     Document 217     Filed 01/16/25      Page 134 of 199     PageID 12366\nperforms or attempts to perform an abortion as defined in this chapter commits the \ncrime of criminal abortion.”).  \n503.  Idaho  limits  abortion  unless  necessary  to  prevent  the  death  of  the \npregnant woman. Idaho Code § 18-622.  \n504.  Idaho authorizes only a physician to perform an abortion. Idaho Code § \n18-608A. It is unlawful for any person other than a physician to cause or perform an \nabortion.  \n505.  As to abortion drugs, Idaho requires a physician, before dispensing or \nprescribing  abortion-inducing  drugs,  to:  assess  the  duration  of  the  pregnancy, \ndetermine that the unborn child is within the uterus, be qualified to provide surgical \nintervention or have an agreement with other local physicians to provide surgical \nintervention, provide informed consent, and make reasonable efforts to ensure that \nthe patient returns for a follow-up visit. Idaho Code § 18-617.  \n506.  Idaho requires informed consent and imposes a 24-hour waiting period \nbefore any abortion. Under Idaho Code § 18-609(2), (4), at least 24 hours before \nperforming  the  abortion,  the  physician  must  provide  materials  to  the  woman \ndescribing: \n•  services available to assist a woman through pregnancy and childbirth; \n•  the physical characteristics of a normal fetus at two-week intervals, accompanied \nby photographs; \n•  the  abortion  procedures  at  various  stages  of  the  fetus  and  any  reasonable \nforeseeable complications and risks to the mother; \n•  a  list  of  health  care  providers,  facilities,  and  clinics  that  offer  to  perform \nultrasounds free of charge; \n134 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z     Document 217     Filed 01/16/25      Page 135 of 199     PageID 12367\n•  statement that the patient has a right to view an ultrasound image and observe \nthe heartbeat monitoring; \n•  where to obtain further information about interventions for chemical abortion that \nmay affect the effectiveness or reversal of a chemical abortion; \n•  resources on Down Syndrome. \n507.  Idaho  requires  printed  materials  to  be  provided  with  information \ndirecting  the  patient  where  to  obtain  assistance  regarding  chemical  abortion, \nincluding the interventions, if any, that may affect the effectiveness or reversal of a \nchemical abortion. Idaho Code § 18-609(2)(f) \n508.  Idaho law provides that 24 hours before an abortion is to be performed, \nthe  physician  must  inform  the  woman  that  ultrasound  imaging  and  heartbeat \nmonitoring are available and that she has the right to view an ultrasound before an \nabortion is performed. Idaho Code  § 18-609(5)–(6).  \n509.  Idaho requires parental consent for a minor seeking abortion. Idaho \nCode § 18-609A(1). A physician must secure written consent from an unemancipated \nminor’s parent or guardian unless the minor waives consent through a judicial bypass \nprocedure. Idaho Code § 18-609A(2).  \n510.  Idaho  requires  that  all  first  trimester  abortions  be  performed  in  a \nhospital or properly staffed and equipped office or clinic and requires second trimester \nabortions to be performed in a hospital. Idaho Code § 18-608(1).  \n511.  Idaho  requires  reports  on  abortions  to  be  filed  describing  probable \npostfertilization age, whether or not there was a medical emergency, and the method \nused for abortion. Idaho Code § 18-506.  \n3.  Kansas’s abortion laws \n512.  Kansas also regulates abortion and other medical services. \n135 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z     Document 217     Filed 01/16/25      Page 136 of 199     PageID 12368\n513.  With some exceptions, including to save the life of the mother, Kansas \nlaw prohibits abortions after twenty-two weeks.  Kan. Stat. Ann. § 65-6703(b)(2), \n(c)(2). \n514.  Kansas requires abortion providers to keep records of abortions.  Id. \n§ 65-6703(d). \n515.  Kansas requires minor girls seeking abortion to obtain parental consent \nprior to performing the abortion unless a waiver is granted or there is a medical \nemergency.  Kan. Stat. Ann. § 65-6705. \n516.  Kansas provides that no abortion shall be performed or induced without \nthe voluntary and informed consent of the woman upon whom the abortion is to be \nperformed or induced. Except in the case of a medical emergency, consent to an \nabortion is voluntary and informed only if at least 24 hours before the abortion the \nphysician who is to perform the abortion or the referring physician has informed the \nwoman in writing, which shall be provided on white paper in a printed format in black \nink with 12-point Times New Roman font, of certain information. Kan. Stat. Ann. \n§ 65-6709(a).  \n517.  Kansas previously had a statute where “[n]o abortion shall be performed \nor induced by any person other than a physician.” Kan. Stat. Ann. § 65-4a10 (West). \nIn  addition,  this  statute  required  mifepristone  specifically  be  “initially  be \nadministered by or in the same room and in the physical presence of the physician \nwho prescribed, dispensed, or otherwise provided the drug to the patient.” Id. It also \nhad an in-person follow-up protection. Id. All of these provisions would have a high \nrisk for preemption. However, this statute was held unconstitutional very recently by \nthe Kansas Supreme Court in Hodes & Nauser, MDs, P.A. v. Stanek, 551 P.3d 62 \n(Kan. 2024).  \n136 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z     Document 217     Filed 01/16/25      Page 137 of 199     PageID 12369\n4.  Other states’ abortion laws \n518.  Many other state laws likewise address the risks of chemical abortions. \nSuch  laws  recognize,  for  example,  that  “abortion-inducing  drugs”:  “present[ ] \nsignificant medical risks to women,” such as “uterine hemorrhage, viral infections, \npelvic inflammatory disease, severe bacterial infection and death,” Miss. Code Ann. \n§ 41-41-103(1)(a); “are associated with an increased risk of complications relative to \nsurgical abortion” that surge “with increasing gestational age,” id. § 41- 41-103(1)(b); \nand “are contraindicated in ectopic pregnancies,” id. § 41-41-107(2). So many states \ncombat those risks by, among other things, requiring that only physicians may \nprovide such drugs, that a physician may do so only after “physically examin[ing] the \nwoman and document[ing] ... the gestational age and intrauterine location of the \npregnancy,” and that these drugs “must be administered in the same room and in the \nphysical presence of the physician.” Id. § 41-41-107(1)-(3).  \n519.  Many other states require in-person exams or dispensing or have other \nabortion statutes that the FDA likely considers preempted. See, e.g., Ala. Code § 26-\n23E-7, 26-23A-4(a), 26-23A-4(b); Alaska Stat. Ann. §§ 08.64.364(c)(1), 08.64.364(c)(2); \nAriz. Rev. Stat.

And, like all elective abortions, elective chemical abortions are generally \nunlawful in several additional States. E.g., Ark. Code Ann. § 20-16-1304 et seq.; Miss. \nCode  Ann.  §  41-41-45(2)  (abortion  unlawful  except  “where  necessary  for  the \npreservation of the mother’s life or where the pregnancy was caused by rape”).  \n521.  When the FDA lifted the in-person dispensing protection in 2021, 19 \nstates prohibited or restricted dispensing abortion drugs remotely, as the following \nmap shows.  \n138 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z     Document 217     Filed 01/16/25      Page 139 of 199     PageID 12371\nStates Protecting Against Remote Dispensing of Abortion Drugs425 \n522.  Today, at least 15 states have restrictions on remote dispensing of \nabortion drugs in effect, as the following map shows.  \n                                            \n425 Kaiser Family Foundation, State Restrictions on Telehealth Abortion (Dec. 2, \n2021),  https://www.kff.org/womens-health-policy/slide/state-restrictions-on-\ntelehealth-abortion/; see also Ex. 93, Guttmacher Institute, Medication Abortion, \nState  Laws  and  Policies  (Oct.  31,  2023),  https://www.guttmacher.org/state-\npolicy/explore/medication-abortion \n139 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z     Document 217     Filed 01/16/25      Page 140 of 199     PageID 12372\nAvailability of Telehealth for Medication Abortion in a Post-Roe United States, as of \nJune 13, 2024426\n \n \n                                            \n426 Kaiser Family Foundation, The Availability and Use of Medication Abortion (Mar. \n20, 2024), https://www.kff.org/womens-health-policy/fact-sheet/the-availability-and-\nuse-of-medication-abortion/ (last updated June 13, 2024).  \n140 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z     Document 217     Filed 01/16/25      Page 141 of 199     PageID 12373\n523.  Kansas provides that no abortion shall be performed or induced without \nthe voluntary and informed consent of the woman upon whom the abortion is to be \nperformed or induced. Except in the case of a medical emergency, consent to an \nabortion is voluntary and informed only if at least 24 hours before the abortion the \nphysician who is to perform the abortion or the referring physician has informed the \nwoman in writing, which shall be provided on white paper in a printed format in black \nink with 12-point Times New Roman font, of certain information. Kan. Stat. Ann. \n§ 65-6709(a).  \n524.  Kansas previously had a statute where “[n]o abortion shall be performed \nor induced by any person other than a physician.” Kan. Stat. Ann. § 65-4a10 (West). \nIn  addition,  this  statute  required  mifepristone  specifically  be  “initially  be \nadministered by or in the same room and in the physical presence of the physician \nwho prescribed, dispensed, or otherwise provided the drug to the patient.” Id. It also \nhad an in-person follow-up protection. Id. All of these provisions would have a high \nrisk for preemption. However, this statute was held unconstitutional very recently by \nthe Kansas Supreme Court in Hodes & Nauser, MDs, P.A. v. Stanek, 551 P.3d 62 \n(Kan. 2024).  \nXXI.  Sovereign  Injuries  to  Plaintiffs’  Interests  in  the  Creation  and \nEnforcement of State laws \n525.  The FDA’s actions interfere with Plaintiff States’ “sovereign interest in \n‘the power to create and enforce a legal code.’” Texas Office of Public Utility Counsel \nv. F.C.C., 183 F.3d 393, 449 (5th Cir. 1999) (quoting Alfred L. Snapp & Son, Inc. v. \nPuerto Rico, 458 U.S. 592, 601 (1982)). \n526.  “Pursuant  to  that  interest,  states  may  have  standing  based  on \n(1) federal  assertions  of  authority  to  regulate matters  they  believe  they  control, \n(2) federal preemption of state law, and (3) federal interference with the enforcement \nof state law, at least where ‘the state statute at issue regulates behavior or provides \n141 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z     Document 217     Filed 01/16/25      Page 142 of 199     PageID 12374\nfor the administration of a state program’ and does not ‘simply purport to immunize \nstate citizens from federal law.’” Texas v. United States, 809 F.3d 134, 153 (5th Cir. \n2015), as revised (Nov. 25, 2015) (citation omitted) (collecting cases).  \n527.  As a result of Defendants’ actions, Plaintiffs have suffered injury to their \nsovereign interests in enacting and enforcing their laws. Defendants (1) intentionally \nfacilitated widespread violations by third parties of state abortion laws by enabling \nan out-of-state abortion drug distribution network out of the reach of the enforcement \nof State laws, (2) unlawfully removed the backstop of federal law and federal law \nenforcement, upon which the States were entitled to rely, (3) purport to preempt state \nabortion laws, and (4) seek to displace and nullify the States’ state-law parental \nrights of notice and consent for abortions for teen girls in foster care. \n528.  These harms are distinct (and in addition to) the harms suffered by the \ncitizens of Plaintiffs as a result of Defendant’s challenged actions. \n529.  The harms to Plaintiffs’ sovereign interests in enacting and enforcing \ntheir laws are irreparable. See, e.g., Kansas v. United States, 249 F.3d 1213, 1227 \n(10th Cir. 2001) (holding that Kansas suffered an irreparable harm where a federal \nagency’s  decision  “places  [Kansas’]  sovereign  interests  and  public  policies  at \nstake[.]”).  \n530.  “The threatened injury to a State’s enforcement of its safety laws is \nwithin the zone of interests of the Administrative Procedure Act[.]” State of Ohio ex \nrel. Celebrezze v. U.S. Dep’t of Transp., 766 F.2d 228, 233 (6th Cir. 1985).  \n531.  Absent  the  relief  sought  in  this  lawsuit,  Defendants’  actions  will \ncontinue to encourage the violation or preemption of Plaintiffs’ laws and will harm \nPlaintiffs’ sovereign interests in the enforcement and enactment of their laws. \n142 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z     Document 217     Filed 01/16/25      Page 143 of 199     PageID 12375\nA.  Injury  to  Plaintiffs’  sovereign  interests  in  the  creation  and \nenforcement of their abortion regulations through Defendants’ \nfacilitation of third parties’ state-law violations. \n532.  Plaintiff States are injured as sovereigns by Defendants’ intentional \nenablement of third parties to undermine state law enforcement and to violate state \nabortion-drug laws.  \n533.  Plaintiff States have a sovereign interest in ensuring the enforcement of \ntheir duly passed laws. See Texas v. United States, 787 F.3d 733, 752 n.38 (5th Cir. \n2015); cf. Abbott v. Perez, 585 U.S. 579, 602 n. 17 (2018) (“[T]he inability to enforce \nits duly enacted plans clearly inflicts irreparable harm on the State[.]”). \n534.  The FDA’s decision has interfered with the enforcement of state laws \nthat  prohibit  abortion  in  certain  circumstances  and  that  require  in-person \nadministration of any abortion drugs.   \n535.  Defendants  have  intentionally  undermined  state  laws  by  enabling \nwidespread state-law criminal and civil violations by third parties, which constitutes \nan injury to Plaintiff States’ sovereign interest in creating and enforcing a legal code. \n536.  Defendants’  actions  have  created  a  practical  impediment  to  on-the-\nground compliance with and enforcement of state laws.  \n537.  The FDA’s deregulatory actions have each increased Plaintiff States’ \nsovereign harms. \n538.  By lowering the barriers to obtain mifepristone, including removing the \nsafeguard  that  the  drug  be  administered  in-person  by  a  licensed  physician, \nDefendants have removed the restrictions that prevented or limited the ability of \nthird parties to unlawfully provide mifepristone in Plaintiff States.  \n539.  The 2016 Changes removed the safeguards ensuring follow-up care, \nenabling providers to supply women with these drugs without the ability to diagnose \nand treat life-threatening complications.  \n143 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z     Document 217     Filed 01/16/25      Page 144 of 199     PageID 12376\n540.  This  change  enabled  out-of-state  abortion-drug  suppliers  to  provide \nabortion drugs to women from Plaintiff States by allowing women to receive drugs \nout of state and then immediately return home to take the drugs.  \n541.  In 2021, the FDA began declining to enforce the in-person dispensing \nprotection of the REMS for mifepristone. \n542.  Under the FDA’s new regime, manufacturers may sell abortion drugs to \nsuppliers, who then prescribe and mail the drugs to women in Plaintiff states without \nan in-person examination—which enables the providers to evade and violate State \nlaws prohibiting or regulating the provision of abortion drugs.  \n543.  This unlawful act had the direct and intended effect of enabling and \nencouraging third parties to provide, through the mail, mifepristone to citizens of \nPlaintiff States for the purpose of inducing high-risk abortions that are expressly \ncontrary to the policies expressed in many state statutes.   \n544.  Since 2021, abortion providers have been mailing FDA-regulated doses \nof mifepristone into Plaintiff States for the purpose of providing abortions to people \nin states that have laws prohibiting chemical abortions.  \n545.  Out-of-state organizations have begun mailing abortion pills directly \ninto  Plaintiff  States  in  reliance  on  the  FDA’s  decision  to  remove  the  in-person \ndispensing protection and the required in-person follow-up visit.  \n546.  This out-of-state market then exploded when the FDA allowed abortion \ndrugs to be dispensed by mail, common carrier, and interactive computer service.  \n547.  This market continued and increased after the FDA formalized the \nremoval of the in-person dispensing protection in January 2023. \n548.  All of this makes it difficult for state law enforcement to detect and deter \nstate law violations and to give effect to state abortion laws. \n144 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z     Document 217     Filed 01/16/25      Page 145 of 199     PageID 12377\n549.  The FDA’s actions force States to divert resources to investigate and \naddress the harms that this lawbreaking will inflict on women, children, and the \npublic interest. \n550.  The FDA’s actions thus “intrude on state governmental functions[,]” \nGregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U.S. 452, 470 (1991), and hobble States’ efforts to protect \nhealth and safety. \n551.  The  FDA’s  actions  moreover  depart  from  the  central  tenet  of  our \nConstitution: that power—particularly over important, hard, controversial issues—\nresides with and must be accountable to the people.  \n552.  Few issues are as important, difficult, and controversial as abortion. The \nConstitution thus leaves the task of regulating and restricting abortion to “the people \nand their elected representatives.” Dobbs, 142 S. Ct. at 2284. Yet the FDA’s actions \nby design and in practice rob from the people in the Plaintiff States important \ndecisions on this vital issue.  \n553.  State abortion laws embody the considered judgments of “the people and \ntheir  elected  representatives.”  Dobbs,  142  S.  Ct.  at  2284.  Defendants’  actions \neviscerating these laws injures the States.  \nB.  Injury  to  Plaintiffs’  sovereign  interests  in  enforcing  state \nabortion regulations through Defendants’ non-enforcement or \nremoval of the backstop of federal law. \n554.  Plaintiff States are injured as sovereigns by Defendants’ unlawful non-\nenforcement  of  federal  statutes  that  result  in  restrictions  on  the  dispensing  of \nabortion drugs and by their unlawful removal of the backstop of federal law.  \n555.  The FDA’s decisions have deprived Plaintiff States of their sovereign \n“benefits that are to flow from participation in the federal system.” Alfred L. Snapp, \n458 U.S. at 608.  \n145 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z     Document 217     Filed 01/16/25      Page 146 of 199     PageID 12378\n556.  One such benefit is the uniform application of federal law and the ability \nof States to rely on the backdrop of federal law when enacting their own regulations. \nCrow Indian Tribe v. United States, 965 F.3d 662, 676-677 (9th Cir. 2020). \n557.  Plaintiff States have relied on the actual or potential backdrop of federal \nlaws and federal law enforcement so the States can implement their own policies \nabout in-person administration, protection of human life, and other policies.   \n558.  Before  Defendants’  changes  to  the  REMS,  the  federal  government \nensured that abortion drugs were only dispensed in person, that abortion drugs were \nnot dispensed by mail, common carrier, or interactive computer service, that abortion \ndrugs were provided through three in-person doctor visits, and that abortion drugs \nwere provided by doctors only.  \n559.  Defendants actively enforced and administered this federal regulatory \nstructure, which reflected the requirements of various federal laws. Plaintiff States \nrelied on these various federal laws and Defendants’ actual or potential enforcement \nof these laws.  \n560.  During  this  time,  no  relevant  federal  statute  changed.  Instead, \nDefendants  changed  their  regulatory  actions  and  their  resulting  enforcement—\nseeking to create a change in federal law through deregulatory action.  \n561.  But because these deregulatory actions failed to comply with federal \nstatutes like the FDCA, PREA, and APA, these regulatory actions did not result in a \nvalid change to federal law. Instead, they amounted to an unlawful removal of a prior \nfederal regulatory structure that provided a backdrop to state regulations providing \nsimilar or greater restrictions on abortion.  \n562.  In particular, Defendants’ prior federal regulatory structure in practice \nreinforced federal and state statutes against dispensing abortion drugs remotely or \nby mail, common carrier, or interactive computer service.  \n146 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z     Document 217     Filed 01/16/25      Page 147 of 199     PageID 12379\n563.  Each  of  Defendants’  challenged  actions  successively  removed \nDefendants’ assistance in enforcing federal and state restrictions on abortion drugs, \nsuch that abortion drugs now need not be dispensed in person, that abortion drugs \nmay be dispensed by mail, common carrier, or interactive computer service, that \nabortion drugs may be provided without any in-person doctor visits, and that abortion \ndrugs may be provided by non-doctors.  \n564.  Plaintiff States are injured by each unlawful withdrawal of Defendants’ \npast and future enforcement of these federal laws, including by their changes to the \nREMS that resulted in the REMS no longer reflecting the requirements of these \nfederal laws. \n565.  Plaintiff States’ sovereign interest in the enforcement of federal law and \nstate  law  has  now  been  impaired.  The  challenged  FDA  actions  “impaired  that \ninterest, because [federal] officials withdrew resources and manpower that further \nthe enforcement of federal and state] law.” United States v. Missouri, No. 23-1457, \n2024 WL 3932470, at *2 (8th Cir. Aug. 26, 2024).  \n566.  Defendants’ withdrawal of this federal assistance transfers the burden \nof law enforcement solely to the States and it at once makes it harder for the States \nto enforce these laws, by shifting abortion drugs into the widespread, anonymous \nstream of commerce taking place through the mail, common carriers, and interactive \ncomputer services.  \n567.  Interference with the state government’s interest in enforcing federal \nand state law is sufficient to establish that Defendants’ action injured Plaintiff \nStates. Missouri, No. 23-1457, 2024 WL 3932470, at *2.  \n568.  “An increased regulatory burden typically satisfies the injury in fact \nrequirement.” Contender Farms, L.L.P. v. U.S. Dep’t of Agric., 779 F.3d 258, 266 (5th \nCir. 2015). \n147 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z     Document 217     Filed 01/16/25      Page 148 of 199     PageID 12380\nC.  Injury  to  Plaintiffs’  sovereign  interests  in  enforcing  state \nabortion  regulations  through  Defendants’  purported \npreemption of state abortion regulations. \n569.  Plaintiffs have a sovereign interest in their laws not being displaced, \npreempted, or nullified by the federal government. Texas Office of Public Utility \nCounsel v. F.C.C., 183 F.3d 393, 449 (5th Cir. 1999) (quoting Alfred L. Snapp, 458 \nU.S. at 601). \n570.  Thus, “irreparable harm exists when a federal regulation prevents a \nstate from enforcing its duly enacted laws.” Texas v. Becerra, 577 F. Supp. 3d 527, \n557 (N.D. Tex. 2021) (collecting cases); see also, e.g., Maryland v. King, 567 U.S. 1301, \n1303 (2012) (Roberts, C.J.: “[A]ny time a State is enjoined by a court from effectuating \nstatutes enacted by representatives of its people, it suffers a form of irreparable \ninjury[.]”). \n571.  Through  announcements  from  HHS  and  DOJ,  Defendants  seek  “to \npreempt” each States’ laws, and this attempt at preemption of state law is itself an \ninjury. Deanda v. Becerra, 96 F.4th 750, 760 (5th Cir. 2024) (“Deanda has shown an \nArticle III injury because the Secretary seeks to preempt his state-conferred right to \nconsent to his children’s obtaining contraceptives”).  \n572.  Defendants purport to preempt state laws regulating the dispensing of \nabortion drugs, including treatment plans, state approval, physician dispensing, \nrequirements for back-up physicians, and in-person dispensing. \n573.  In addition, more than one federal court has determined that state \nabortion drug regulations are preempted by the FDA’s REMS.  \n574.  In one case, a federal court held that the FDA’s “2023 REMS reflect[ ] a \ndetermination by the FDA that when mifepristone is prescribed, it may be prescribed \nvia telemedicine.” GenBioPro, Inc. v. Sorsaia, No. CV 3:23-0058, 2023 WL 5490179, \nat *10 (S.D.W. Va. Aug. 24, 2023). On that basis, the court ruled that West Virginia’s \n148 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z     Document 217     Filed 01/16/25      Page 149 of 199     PageID 12381\nlaw—which, like Missouri’s, does not permit telemedicine abortion with chemical \nabortion  drugs—was  preempted.  Id.  Although  the  plaintiff  later  voluntarily \ndismissed its (successful) preemption claim, it appears the plaintiff did so because it \nneeded to drop the one count that was not dismissed so that the district court’s ruling \ndismissing all other counts would become a final judgment that could be appealed. \nSee  GenBioPro,  ECF  78  (filing a  notice of  appeal  three  days  after  dropping  its \nsuccessful preemption argument).  \n575.  In another case, a federal court enjoined the enforcement of several \nNorth Carolina state abortion drug regulations on a similar theory. Bryant v. Stein, \nNo. 1:23-CV-77, 2024 WL 3107568, at *1 (M.D.N.C. June 3, 2024). That court enjoined \nstate laws that “prohibit any healthcare provider other than a licensed physician from \nproviding mifepristone,” id. (citing N.C. Gen. Stat § 90-21.83A, § 90-21.83B, § 90-\n21.93), that “require that mifepristone be provided in person,” id. (citing N.C. Gen. \nStat. § 14-44.1, § 90-21.83A, § 90-21.83B), state laws that “require scheduling an in-\nperson follow-up visit after providing mifepristone or efforts to ensure such a follow-\nup appointment,” id. (citing N.C. Gen. Stat. § 90-21.83A, § 90-21.83B, § 90-21.93), \nand state laws that require the reporting of non-fatal adverse events related to \nmifepristone to the FDA,” id. (citing N.C. Gen. Stat. § 90-21.93).  \n576.  The court held that these abortion drug regulations “stand as obstacles” \nto  the  FDA  REMS. Bryant  v.  Stein,  No.  1:23-CV-77, 2024  WL  1886907, at  *15 \n(M.D.N.C. Apr. 30, 2024), appeal filed, Nos. 24-1576, 1600, 1617 (4th Cir. 2024). \n“When a state imposes a restriction on the sale or distribution of an FDA-approved \ndrug that is designed to reduce the risks associated with the drug even though the \nFDA explicitly considered and rejected that restriction as unnecessary for safe use \nunder the statutory regime imposed and required by Congress, then that state law is \npreempted.” Id. “North Carolina cannot second-guess the FDA's explicit judgment on \n149 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z     Document 217     Filed 01/16/25      Page 150 of 199     PageID 12382\nhow to manage risks from and safely prescribe, dispense, and administer REMS \ndrugs, including mifepristone.” Id. at *17.  \n577.  If  sued,  Plaintiff  States  will  vigorously  dispute  that  their  laws  are \npreempted by FDA’s REMS, but HHS and DOJ’s announcements and the GenBioPro \ndecision each make clear that the FDA’s unlawful REMS creates a substantial risk \nof injury to Plaintiff States in the form of interference with Plaintiff States’ ability to \ncreate and enforce a legal code. \nD.  Injury to Plaintiffs’ sovereign interests in exercising state-law \nparental rights of notice and consent for abortions for teen girls \nin foster care. \n578.  Plaintiff States are also injured because Defendants have sought to \ninterfere with and nullify the States’ exercise of state-law parental rights for children \nin state custody, such as teen girls in the foster care system.  \n579.  By seeking to enable teen girls to obtain abortion drugs online by mail \nall on their own, Defendants seek “to undermine [the States’] state right to consent \nto [their custodial] children’s medical care[.]” Deanda, 96 F.4th at 755. “That invasion \nof [Plaintiff States’] state-created right alone creates Article III injury.” Id. at 753.  \n580.  The FDA’s decisions to increase access to (and demand for) chemical \nabortions inflict substantial economic injury on Plaintiff States because it risks harm \nto girls in state custody, both girls in state foster care systems or other state facilities.  \n581.  Each Plaintiff State is the legal parent or guardian of many minor girls \nof reproductive age.  \n582.  Each Plaintiff State has well-established state foster care systems and \nother state facilities for minor girls. State foster care systems can include girls in \nstate facilities or placed with licensed foster care families. Each State has detailed \nlaws and procedures to protect these girls’ health and welfare while in state custody \nor control.  \n150 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z     Document 217     Filed 01/16/25      Page 151 of 199     PageID 12383\n583.  Plaintiff States are the legal parent, guardian, or custodian of many \nminor girls in state foster care systems or other state facilities. \n584.   Plaintiff States actively enforce and administer their rights to decide \nwhether these children obtain medical care.  \n585.  Plaintiff States may assert parental rights that would otherwise belong \nto the parents of minor girls in the foster care system or other state facilities, so long \nas the minor’s prior parents’ rights have been terminated and the State has become \nthe minor’s legal parent. This standing is similar to the rights of parents to seek relief \non behalf of their children as next friend.  \n586.  Minor  girls  in  the  foster  care  system  or  other  state  facilities  are \nsusceptible to pregnancy and to seeking abortions.  \n587.  These girls are protected by state laws providing for State control of \ntheir medical care and by state laws restricting or prohibiting abortion.  \n588.  Before the FDA’s deregulatory actions, the States (as legal parent or \nguardian) were entitled to know or consent to abortions for minor girls in the foster \ncare system or other state facilities.  \n589.  The  FDA’s  deregulatory  actions  impede  and  undermine  the  States’ \nstate-law rights to prior notice and consent to abortions for minor girls in state foster \ncare systems and girls in state facilities.  \n590.  The  FDA’s  deregulatory  actions  impede  and  undermine  the  States’ \nstate-law rights to restrict and prohibit abortions for minor girls in state foster care \nsystems and girls in state facilities.  \n591.  The interference with and attempted nullification of these state-law \nrights is itself an injury.  \n592.  In addition, Defendants’ actions injure Plaintiff States in a further way: \nby  increasing  the  risk  that  children  under  State  custody  or  control  will  obtain \nabortion drugs by mail, common carrier, or interactive computer service.  \n151 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z     Document 217     Filed 01/16/25      Page 152 of 199     PageID 12384\nXXII. Economic Injuries to Plaintiffs’ Medical Systems \n593.  In addition to the incalculable toll from the loss of human life, the FDA’s \ndecisions  to  increase  access  to  abortion  drugs  irrespective  of  state  law  inflicts \nsubstantial economic injury on Plaintiff States as the payers or insurers of residents’ \nmedical expenses. The FDA’s deregulatory actions have both caused an increase in \nthe number of pregnant women seeking treatment for abortion drug complications \npaid for by the States and caused a resulting diversion of the States resources from \ntheir general budgets. \n594.  In addition to the immeasurable pain and suffering that their citizens \nsuffer from the FDA’s actions, the States are injured by the FDA’s under-regulation \nof chemical abortion drugs because it causes the States to pay increased medical \nexpenses for women seeking treatment for abortion complications.  \n595.  For  example,  in  2022,  Idaho  Medicaid  alone  expended  at  least \n$12,658.05 in total funds ($3,797.42 state funds and $8,860.64 federal funds) for \ncomplications from abortion drugs.427 This provided coverage for a woman presenting \nwith bleeding following a failed medication abortion: Idaho Medicaid paid for her \nmedically necessary dilation & curettage procedure.428 \n596.  The actual numbers are higher. Given that miscarriage symptoms can \ngreatly resemble symptoms from complications created by abortion drugs, and given \nthat some patients will not disclose the cause of their complications, many procedures \npaid for through state Medicaid programs are not logged as expenses related to \nabortion complications. \n                                            \n427 Ex. 94, Charron Affidavit ¶ 12. \n428 Id. ¶ 14. \n152 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z     Document 217     Filed 01/16/25      Page 153 of 199     PageID 12385\n597.  Likewise, in 2019, Idaho Medicaid paid at least $10,086.47 in total funds \n($3,025.94 state funds and $7,060.53 federal funds) for treatment and follow-up care \nfor abortion medical complications.429  \n598.  Since mid-2022, Idaho prohibits abortions except to save the life of the \nmother, and so it is highly unlikely that any of these drugs were dispensed by \nprescribers in-person in Idaho.  \n599.  This “effect on the states’ fiscs” is an economic injury for Plaintiff States. \nTexas v. United States, 809 F.3d 134, 152–53 (5th Cir. 2015), as revised (Nov. 25, \n2015); see also, e.g., Biden v. Nebraska, 143 S. Ct. at 2366 (“financial harm is an injury \nin fact”); TransUnion LLC v. Ramirez, 594 U.S. 413, 425 (2021) (“[C]ertain harms \nreadily  qualify  as  concrete  injuries  under  Article  III.  The  most  obvious  are \ntraditional tangible harms, such as physical harms and monetary harms.”).  \n600.  Indeed, “[f]or standing purposes, a loss of even a small amount of money \nis ordinarily an ‘injury,’” Czyzewski v. Jevic Holding Corp., 580 U.S. 451, 464 (2017), \nand here Defendants’ dangerous actions have resulted in the States paying far more \nthan mere pennies in costs for medical care.  \n601.  This satisfies Article III. See California v. Azar, 911 F.3d 558, 571–73 \n(9th Cir. 2018) (finding state had standing based on an injury to its economic interests \nwhere the state was responsible for reimbursing women who seek contraception \nthrough state-run programs).  \n602.  Indeed, suits like this where one entity “challenges the under-regulation \nof another” are well-established.” Corner Post, Inc. v. Bd. of Governors of Fed. Rsrv. \nSys., 144 S. Ct. 2440, 2465 (2024) (Kavanaugh, J., concurring). “One example is the \nCourt’s landmark decision in Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association of United \nStates, Inc. v. State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co., 463 U.S. 29, (1983).” Id. \n                                            \n429 Id. ¶ 11.  \n153 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z     Document 217     Filed 01/16/25      Page 154 of 199     PageID 12386\n“That case arose when several insurance companies challenged a federal agency's \nrescission of safety standards for new motor vehicles.” Id.  \n603.  Decisions like State Farm show that third-party insurers or payers like \nState Medicaid programs have standing to seek redress from deregulatory actions \nthat injure them economically by resulting in more expenses to be paid through \ninsurance claims. “At no point in that landmark opinion on the judicial review of \nagency actions did the Court state (or need to state) the obvious: Because the agency \ndid not regulate the insurers themselves, the insurers could obtain relief from the \ndownstream effects of the agency’s rescission of the safety standards only if the \ninsurers could obtain vacatur of that rescission.” Id.  \nA.  The FDA’s deregulatory actions predictably lead more and more \npatients  in  Plaintiff  States  to  need  medical  care  for \ncomplications from chemical abortion drugs. \n604.  Abortion suppliers are providing abortion drugs to women from Plaintiff \nStates who travel out of state to obtain abortion drugs and then return home to \ncomplete the process.  \n605.  Defendants’ removal of three in-person doctor visits results in Plaintiff \nStates providing emergency and follow-up care for women who receive abortion drugs \nin other states.  \n606.  For example, although abortion is illegal in Missouri (except for medical \nemergencies), some Missourians obtain abortion drugs by traveling out of State, only \nto return to Missouri where they experience the chemical abortion. These women \nwould then seek follow-up care or emergency services in Missouri.  \n154 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z     Document 217     Filed 01/16/25      Page 155 of 199     PageID 12387\n607.  In 2022, at least 2,883 Missourians obtained abortions in Kansas. A \nclear majority, 59.6%, of abortions performed in Kansas were chemical abortions.430 \n608.  Unlike with surgical abortions, complications from chemical abortions \ntypically occur when a woman has returned home. The FDA has warned prescribers \nabout this since its approval of abortion drugs in 2000. As the FDA made clear in its \n2000 Approval, “[i]t is important for patients to be fully informed about ... the need \nfor follow up, especially on Day 14 to confirm expulsion.”431  \n609.  In fact, the FDA’s original label emphasized that the Day 14 visit “is \nnecessary”  and  “very  important  to  confirm  by  clinical  examination  or \nultrasonographic scan that a complete termination of pregnancy has occurred.”432  \n610.  The FDA’s Prescriber Agreement also advises that the Day 14 follow-up \nvisit “is very important to confirm that a complete termination of pregnancy has \noccurred and that there have been no complications.”433 This, “[p]atient adherence to \ndirections for use and visits is critical to the drug’s effectiveness and safety.”434 \n611.  But Missouri citizens are thus told “to complete the chemical abortion \nregimen at home,” and the FDA has thus “directed the hundreds of thousands of \nwomen who have complications to seek ‘emergency care’ from” local hospitals at \nhome.

The vast majority of Missourians who obtain chemical abortions in \nKansas or other States complete the chemical regimen in Missouri and, if they \nexperience complications, seek emergency care at facilities in Missouri.    \n613.  Because  of  the  FDA’s  actions  removing  all  in-person  dispensing \nprotection, many women in Plaintiff States like Missouri have also obtained chemical \nabortion drugs through the mail, common carrier, or interactive computer service.  \n614.  The abortion suppliers dispensing drugs to Plaintiff States through the \nmail, common carrier, or interactive computer service are described above, supra Sec. \nXVIII.D. \n615.  Women  then  take  these  drugs  and  suffer  complications  in  Plaintiff \nStates, with no need to travel out-of-state. \nB.  The  FDA’s  deregulatory  actions  lead  to  increased  harm  and \nincreased  medical  care  for  complications  from  chemical \nabortion drugs. \n616.  Plaintiffs’ citizens include women and girls who have suffered and will \nsuffer from complications from the FDA’s unlawful approval of chemical abortion \ndrugs and subsequent elimination of the safeguards previously included with the use \nof chemical abortion drugs. \n617.  Chemical abortion drugs cause women and girls who are citizens of \nPlaintiffs to suffer many intense side effects, including cramping, heavy bleeding, and \nsevere pain. \n618.  The FDA does “not dispute that a significant percentage of women who \ntake mifepristone experience adverse effects.” All. for Hippocratic Med. v. Food & \nDrug Admin., 78 F.4th 210, 229 (5th Cir. 2023), rev’d, 602 U.S. 367 (2024). “FDA has \nacknowledged  that  a  certain  fraction  of  patients  would  require  surgery  due  to \nmiscellaneous complications.” Id. This fraction is about “5-8” percent, according to the \nFDA. Id.  \n156 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z     Document 217     Filed 01/16/25      Page 157 of 199     PageID 12389\n619.  “Some  women  experience  especially  severe  complications,  such  as \nsepsis ….” Id.  \n620.  “[T]housands of women, and as many as hundreds of thousands, have \nexperienced serious adverse effects as a result of taking the drug, and required \nsurgery or emergency care to treat those effects.” Id. at 230.  \n621.  Women also are told to “complete the chemical abortion regimen at \nhome,” and the FDA has “directed the hundreds of thousands of women who have \ncomplications to seek ‘emergency care’ from” local hospitals near where they live. All. \nfor Hippocratic Med., 2023 WL 2913725, at *8.  \n622.  Because the FDA does not require it, many abortion providers do not \nremain physically near women and girls during the most painful and excruciating \nperiods of the chemical abortion drug regimen, often sending the women and girls \nhome with the drugs.  \n623.  Given  their lack  of admitting  privileges and  treatment  capabilities, \nabortion providers usually instruct women to go to the emergency department of the \nclosest hospital for treatment of any severe adverse events.  \n624.  This practice is consistent with the FDA’s current Medication Guide for \nmifepristone. The FDA directs women to “go to the nearest emergency room” if they \ncannot reach their provider.435 And because remote providers hundreds of miles away \ncannot perform any follow-up care, women are left with one option: the emergency \nroom. \n625.  The FDA’s current Patient Agreement also warns women that a range \nof listed “symptoms” could “require emergency care.”436 \n                                            \n435 Ex. 5, 2023 Mifeprex Label at 16. \n436 Ex. 44, Mifepristone Patient Agreement. \n157 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z     Document 217     Filed 01/16/25      Page 158 of 199     PageID 12390\n626.  Of those women who end up in the emergency room after taking abortion \ndrugs,  many  suffer  particularly  severe  or  critical  injuries.  Data  for  emergency \ndepartment visits for Medicaid-eligible women following various pregnancy outcomes \nshows that “an [emergency department] visit following a chemical abortion was \nsignificantly more likely to have a severe or critical acuity rating than a visit following \nsurgical abortion, live birth, or an ED visit at any time by a woman who was never \npregnant.”437  \n627.  The study also found that ED visits coded severe or critical for women \nwho underwent a chemical abortion increased by 4,041.1% between 2004 and 2015, \ncompared to a 450.6% increase for surgical abortion subjects and 20.9% for live birth \nsubjects.438  \n628.  Dispensing drugs remotely with no in-person care has higher risks than \nin-person care.  \n629.  Dispensing  drugs  remotely  increases  these  complication  rates  and \nnumber of complications.  \n630.  These higher complication rates, ER rates, and hospitalization rates for \nchemical abortions cause direct economic harms on Plaintiff States in several ways. \n631.  Because of and since Defendants’ actions, the number of women and \ngirls  who  are  citizens  of  Plaintiff  States,  who  have  suffered  complications  from \nchemical abortion, and who have required critical medical treatment has increased \nand will continue to increase. \n                                            \n437  James  Studnicki  et  al.,  Comparative  Acuity  of  Emergency  Department  Visits \nFollowing Pregnancy Outcomes Among Medicaid Eligible Women, 2004-2015, Int’l J. \nEpidemiology  &  Pub.

The  FDA’s  decision  to  expand  the  gestational  age  for  approved \nmifepristone use to 70 days (10 weeks) harms women and girls and increases the \nnumber of chemical abortions and resulting complications. \n633.  The FDA acknowledges that abortion “failure rate” and thus the need \nfor surgical intervention steadily “increase[ ] with ... gestational age.”439  \n634.  The FDA, ACOG, and others have confirmed that the “failure rate” \nclimbs from roughly 2 to 7 percent when moving from seven to ten weeks’ gestation.440 \nThe FDA thus recognizes that up to 7 percent of “women taking Mifeprex will need a \nsurgical procedure” to end the pregnancy, remove retained fetal parts or tissue, or \n“stop bleeding.”441 \n635.  This  expansion  of  the  permissible  gestational  age  is  especially \ndangerous for women and girls when combined with the FDA’s elimination of the in-\nperson dispensing and follow-up visit protections. \n636.  For  example,  without  an  initial  in-person  visit,  women  may \nunderestimate  gestational  age  and  take  the  drugs  past  the  approved  ten-week \nlimit.442 Women beyond ten weeks have higher “chances of complications due to the \nincreased amount of tissue, leading to hemorrhage, infection[,] and/or the need for \nsurgeries or other emergency care.”443 The FDA recently acknowledged that “in-\nperson dispensing avoids the possibility of delay” in taking mifepristone and the \n                                            \n439 Ex. 34, 2021 FDA Response at 9; Ex. 25, Mifeprex 2023 Label at 13.  \n440 Ex. 5, Mifeprex 2023 Label at 13; Ex. 27, ACOG Gestation Bulletin, supra note 54; \nEx. 2, 2016 Summary Review at 29–31. \n441 Ex. 5, Mifeprex 2023 Label at 17; see also Maarit J.

In addition, routine follow-up examination can uncover complications—\nsuch as retained pregnancy tissue—before they become more serious.444 Removing \nthe requirement for those visits naturally results in more women reporting to the \nemergency room or seeking state-provided care. \n638.  The  FDA’s  elimination  of  in-person  drug  administration,  physician \nsupervision,  and  patient  follow-up,  and  its  removal  of  the  in-person  dispensing \nprotection exposes women and girls to increased risk of suffering complications from \nchemical  abortion  and  requiring  further  medical  attention  following  the  drug \nregimen. \n639.  The FDA has eliminated all procedural safeguards that would rule out \nectopic  pregnancies,  verify  gestational  age,  identify  any  contraindications  to \nprescribing  mifepristone,  or  identify  potential  complications  like  sepsis  and \nhemorrhage, remaining fetal parts, and others until the patient is at a critical time \nor  it  is  too  late  to  help  the  patient.  As  a  result,  women  and  girls  often  suffer \nunexpected episodes of heavy bleeding, life-threatening infections, or severe pain and \nmust rush to the emergency department of the nearest hospital. \n640.  The  FDA’s  decision  not  to  require  abortion  providers  to  report  all \nadverse events for chemical abortion drugs harms women and girls who are citizens \nof Plaintiffs because it creates an inaccurate and false safety profile for the use of \nchemical abortion drugs. \n                                            \n444 Ex. 83, Jester Decl. ¶ 25.  \n160 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z     Document 217     Filed 01/16/25      Page 161 of 199     PageID 12393\n641.  Due  to  inadequate  adverse  event  reporting,  the  true  rates  of  risks \nassociated with chemical abortion drugs remain undercounted and therefore are \nunknown.  \n642.  Because abortion providers cannot know the accurate risk levels that \ntheir patients face when ingesting these drugs, these providers cannot properly \ninform their patients about the risks associated with chemical abortion.  \n643.  This prevents women and girls who are citizens of Plaintiffs from giving \ninformed consent to these providers. This results too in an increased use of abortion \ndrugs and resulting complications.  \n644.  Abortion providers who prescribe or dispense chemical abortion drugs \nto  citizens  of  Plaintiffs  are  not  providing  women  with  an  adequate,  accurate \nassessment of the known risks and effects associated with chemical abortion. \n645.   Therefore, women and girls are unable to give informed consent for the \ndrugs they are receiving, and thus they are not consenting at all to taking the \nchemical abortion drugs—resulting in physical and mental injuries. \n646.  Women  and  girls  often  suffer  distress  and  regret  after  undergoing \nchemical abortion, sometimes seeking to reverse the effects of mifepristone.445  \n647.  A  woman  or  girl  can  experience  these  emotions  and  feelings  upon \nviewing the body of her lifeless baby after taking chemical abortion drugs.446  \n                                            \n445 Ex. 13, Katherine A.

Between April 28, 2018, and August 23, 2023, Missouri’s Department of \nHealth and Senior Services (DHSS) received 438 abortion complication reports, 186 \nof which (about 42.4%) were submitted following chemical abortions.447  \n649.

For the years 2016 to 2018, the Idaho Department of Health & Welfare \ncollected limited general data of complications from chemical abortions.449   \n651.

Women and girls who are citizens of Plaintiffs will continue to suffer \ncomplications from chemical abortion drugs. \n653.  Although  abortion  suppliers  have  responded  to  Dobbs  by  no  longer \nsubmitting the required state abortion reports, other data from non-governmental \nsources  shows  that  Defendants’  2021  and  2023  actions  removing  any  in-person \ndispensing protections have harmed Plaintiff States.  \n654.  In Plaintiff States Missouri and Idaho, the baseline for abortions via \nabortion drugs should be low or near zero beginning in mid-2022, when each states’ \nabortion laws were allowed to take effect.  \n655.  As described above, these states allow for abortions only in certain \ncircumstances, and these circumstances (such as the need to save the life of the \nmother) do not occur in high numbers.  \n656.  The non-governmental data nevertheless shows that the number of \nabortions via abortion drugs for Missouri and Idaho residents with no in-person \nfollow-up care is not low and is much higher than zero.  \n657.  These abortions, and the resulting harmful complications, are traceable \nto  Defendants’  2021  and  2023  removal  of  in-person  dispensing  protections. \nDefendants’ removal of in-person dispensing protections allowed these drugs to be \ndispensed in other states without in-person follow-up visits and, significantly, by \nmail, common carrier, or interactive computer service.  \n658.  This lack of in-person dispensing not only results in the use of abortion \ndrugs by state residents, it resulted in an increase in the use of these drugs, and it \nresulted in increased harm to women that leads them to receive follow-up care and \nemergency services in Plaintiff States.  \n659.  Plaintiff States operate Medicaid and other programs to pay medical \nexpenses for reproductive-age women.  \n164 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z     Document 217     Filed 01/16/25      Page 165 of 199     PageID 12397\n660.

Combining  the  above  data  from  the  Census  Bureau  about  the \npercentage of women on Medicaid with state health department abortion totals, it is \npossible  to  estimate  the  total  number  of  chemical  abortions  on  state  Medicaid \nenrollees.  \n692.  It is further possible to approximate the number of Medicaid enrollees \nin  each  state  who  will  seek  emergency  care  after  suffering  complications  from \nabortion drugs.  \n693.  The FDA label for abortion drugs says that an estimated 2.9 to 4.6 \npercent  of  women  will  visit  the  emergency  room  after  taking  mifepristone.474 \nApplying this rate to the estimated number of Medicaid enrollees taking abortion \ndrugs yields the following estimates of the number of abortion complications paid for \nby each states’ Medicaid program.  \n694.  The  following  table  shows  the  estimated  chemical  abortions  and \ncomplications from abortion drugs for Missouri Medicaid enrollees per year.  \n   \n                                            \n473 Id. \n474 Ex. 5, 2023 Mifeprex Label at 8. \n173 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z     Document 217     Filed 01/16/25      Page 174 of 199     PageID 12406\nEstimated chemical abortions for and complications \nfrom abortion drugs for Missouri Medicaid enrollees by year475 \n \nYear  2016  2017   2018  2019  2020  2021  2022 \nTotal estimated  2,931   2,893   2,529   2,189   2,298   2,503   1,792  \nMissouri chemical \nabortions \nPercentage of  11.3%  12.4%  11.8%  10.9%  12.1%476  12.1%  14.6% \nreproductive-age \nwomen on Medicaid \nEstimated chemical  331  358  298  238  278  302  261 \nabortions performed \non Medicaid \nenrollees \nLow estimate of  9.60  10.38  8.64  6.90   8.06  8.76   7.57 \nabortion-drug ER \nvisits for Medicaid \nenrollees (2.9% \ncomplication rate)  \nHigh estimate of  15.23  16.47  13.71  10.95  12.79  13.89  12.00 \nabortion-drug ER \nvisits for Medicaid \nenrollees (4.6% \ncomplication rate) \n695.

The FDA’s actions result in Plaintiff States’ public insurance \npaying for medical expenses for the increasing number of \npatients suffering abortion-drug complications. \n698.  Abortion has many victims. That is why even though many States like \nMissouri and Idaho do not pay for abortions, they do pay for many medical expenses \nfor women who need treatment after suffering chemical abortions.  \n                                            \n479 Because there is no 2020 data from the U.S. Census Bureau, 2021 data is used.  \n176 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z     Document 217     Filed 01/16/25      Page 177 of 199     PageID 12409\n699.  Plaintiff  States  pay  for  medical  bills  related  to  abortion-drug \ncomplications when women on public insurance (such as  Medicaid or insurance \nprovided by the State to government workers) obtain chemical abortions and must go \nto the emergency room or hospital in Plaintiff States. \n700.  Sometimes these costs are individually identifiable.  But often they are \nnot because it is often not clear to a physician if a woman is presenting because of a \nnatural miscarriage or a drug-induced abortion.  But it is a statistical certainty that \nwomen  harmed  by  these  drugs  obtain  emergency  services  that  are  paid  for  by \nMedicaid.  \n701.  Even in States that have greatly restricted abortions, women suffer \nsevere complications after taking abortion drugs and must seek emergency medical \nservices.  \n702.  Plaintiff States pay for some of the emergency medical costs associated \nwith chemical abortions for women who are on Medicaid or other public insurance, \nsuch as insurance programs provided to government employees.  \n703.  “Medicaid … is designed to advance cooperative federalism.” Wisconsin \nDep’t of Health and Fam. Services v. Blumer, 534 U.S. 473, 495 (2002). And yet the \nFDA’s actions increase the number of women who must seek emergency medical care, \nincluding care paid for by Medicaid. At the same time that the States have agreed to \noperate a cooperative-federalism program to cover emergency medical costs, the FDA \nhas taken action to drain state resources that go into that program. \n704.  HHS estimates that the average cost of a Medicaid-covered ER visit in \n2017 was $420, a number only set to increase over time due to inflation and increasing \n177 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z     Document 217     Filed 01/16/25      Page 178 of 199     PageID 12410\nmedical costs.480 Of course, a Medicaid “covered charge” figure may be a fraction of \ntotal costs for that visit.  \n705.  One common method of treating abortion drug complications is a D&C \n(dilation and curettage) to evacuate the contents of the uterus. The costs of a D&C to \nMedicaid may vary by State, by practice setting, and by level of care.  \n706.  According  to  the  state  reimbursement  schedule,  Missouri  Medicaid \nreimburses $2,544.80 for a D&C at an outpatient hospital.481 Missouri Medicaid \nreimburses $227.86 for a D&C in general surgical settings.482 Missouri Medicaid \nreimburses  $316.25  to  $1388.51  for  a  D&C  at  other  service  settings.483  At  an \noutpatient hospital, Missouri Medicaid reimburses $360.52 for an ER visit requiring \na moderate amount of medical decision making and $522.83 for an ER visit requiring \na high amount of medical decision making.484  \n707.

These figures do not include the standard per diem rate for hospital \nstays, if needed. \n711.  Much care for abortion-drug complications and other maternity care is \nbilled for in bundled payments. “A bundled payment is a single, fixed payment for a \ngroup of services provided to treat a condition during a defined episode of care.”490 As \na result, some Medicaid data often may not break down the true costs of care with \nthis level of specificity and may simply describe care as maternity services. \n712.  Each year Plaintiff States expend funds covering expenses associated \nwith medical complications from abortions. \n713.  “For example, in Calendar Year 2022, Idaho Medicaid provided coverage \nfor a woman presenting with bleeding following a failed medication abortion. The \nmedical intervention that was required and that Idaho Medicaid covered was dilation \n& curettage.”491  \n714.  Beginning in 2022, Idaho prohibited abortions except to save the life of \nthe mother, and so it is unlikely that any of these drugs were dispensed by in-person \nprescribers in Idaho. \n715.  “In Calendar Year 2022, Idaho Medicaid expended $12,658.05 in total \nfunds ($3,797.42 state funds and $8,860.64 federal funds) covering treatment and \nfollow-up care for abortion medical complications.”492  \n                                            \n490 MACPAC, Medicaid Payment Initiatives to Improve Maternal and Birth Outcomes \nat  3  (April  2019),  https://www.macpac.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Medicaid-\nPayment-Initiatives-to-Improve-Maternal-and-Birth-Outcomes.pdf. \n491 Ex. 94, Charron Affidavit ¶ 14. \n492 Id. ¶ 12. \n180 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z     Document 217     Filed 01/16/25      Page 181 of 199     PageID 12413\n716.  This  was  up  from  2019,  when  Idaho  Medicaid  “expended  at  least \n$10,086.47 total funds ($3,025.94 state funds and $7,060.53 federal funds) covering \ntreatment and follow-up care for abortion medical complications.”493 \n717.  These  numbers  likely  understate  the  true  cost  because  chemical \nabortions  routinely  are  miscoded  as  miscarriages.  Chemical  abortions  among \nMedicaid recipients have historically often been misclassified by ER staff as natural \nmiscarriages.  \n718.  Abortion  activists  and  providers  encourage  women  to  mislead  ER \ndoctors by saying they are having a miscarriage.494 It is also possible to estimate how \nmuch Idaho has paid for complications from abortion drugs by applying Idaho’s \ncurrent reimbursement rates to the estimated number of abortion drug complications \nand estimated number of Medicaid-covered D&C’s for abortion drug complications \n(even though these abortion complication reports likely are an undercount).   \nEstimated Medicaid Costs Based on \nTotal Reported Idaho Chemical Abortions Complications by Year \n \nYear  2016  2017  2018  2019  2020  2021  2022  Total \nTotal Reported  5  6  9  10  26  30  9  75 \nChemical Abortion \nComplications \nEstimated  .6  .76  .93  .99  5.17  5.97  1.75  16.17 \nAbortion Drug \nComplications \nCovered by \nMedicaid  \nEstimated  0 to  0 to  0 to  0 to  $262.25  $209.80  $52.45  $839.20 to \nMinimum  $52.45   $52.45   $52.45   $52.45   to  to  to  $891.65 \nPayments for  $314.70  $262.25  $104.9 \n                                            \n493 Id. ¶ 11. \n494 See, e.g., Ex. 11, Will a doctor be able to tell if you’ve taken abortion pills?, Women \nHelp Women (Sept. 23, 2019), https://womenhelp.org/en/page/1093/will-a-doctor-be-\nable-to-tell-if-you-ve-taken-abortion-pills;  Ex.  12,  How  do  you  know  if  you  have \ncomplications  and  what  should  you  do?,  AidAccess, \nhttps://aidaccess.org/en/page/459/how-do-you-know-if-you-have-complications-and-\nwhat-should-you-do (last visited Aug. 28, 2024). \n181 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z     Document 217     Filed 01/16/25      Page 182 of 199     PageID 12414\nAbortion Drug \nComplications \nCovered by \nMedicaid (at \ncurrent rate of \n$52.45 for a \nminimal \noutpatient visit) \nEstimated Higher  0 to  0 to  0 to  0 to  $1240.60  $1240.60  $248.12  $3,969.92 to \nMedicaid  $248.12  $248.12  $248.12  $248.12  to  to  to  $4,218.04   \nPayments for  $1488.72   $1488.72  $496.24 \nAbortion Drug \nComplications for \nD&C’s (at current \ngeneral setting \nrate of $248.12) \nTotal Chemical  3  4  6  9  22  16  3  50 \nAbortions \nResulting In \nIncomplete \nAbortion Or \nRetained Tissue  \nEstimated D&C’s   .38  .51  .62  .891  4.38  3.18  .58  10.54 \nCovered by \nMedicaid for \nAbortions \nResulting In \nIncomplete \nAbortion Or \nRetained Tissue \nHigh Estimate for  0 to  0 to  0 to  0 to  $992.48  $744.36  0 to  $2,481.20 to \nMedicaid  $248.12   $248.12  $248.12  $248.12  to  to  $248.12  $2,729.32 \nPayments for  $1240.60  $992.48 \nD&C’s for \nAbortions \nResulting In \nIncomplete \nAbortion Or \nRetained Tissue \n(at current general \nsetting rate of \n$248.12)  \nLow Estimate for  0 to  0 to  0 to  0 to  $5002.16  $3751.62  0 to  $12,505.40 \nMedicaid  $1,250.54  $1,250.54  $1,250.54  $1,250.54  to  to  $1,250. to \nPayments for  $6252.70  $5002.16  54  $13,755.94 \nD&C’s  for \nAbortions \nResulting In \nIncomplete \nAbortion Or \nRetained Tissue \n(at current ASC \nrate of $1,250.54) \n719.

Of course, these estimates may be an undercount if actual charges are \nhigher or there is a higher number of patients presenting for treatment.  \n723.  Plaintiff States also pay for the cost of medical bills associated with \nchemical abortion complications when women obtain emergency care out of state. For \nexample, Missouri Medicaid pays for emergency services rendered in other States.497   \n724.  Similarly,  government  employees  can  receive  payments  from \ngovernment health insurance programs for government employees out of state. \n725.  Plaintiff  States  routinely  spend  money  through  public  insurance \ntreating medical complications related to abortion drugs, even in states where such \nabortions are unlawful in most circumstances.  \nE.  States pay costs of public hospitals for medical expenses for the \nincreasing  number  of  patients  in  Plaintiff  States  suffering \ncomplications from chemical abortion drugs. \n726.  Another way that Plaintiff States subsidize healthcare for reproductive-\nage women is through public medical facilities.  \n727.  Each  Plaintiff  State  has  public  and  private  medical  facilities  that \nprovide care for complications from chemical abortion drugs even if the facilities do \nnot provide elective abortions. \n728.  Plaintiff States operate various public hospitals that serve women who \nobtain chemical abortions. The public hospitals act as an arm of the State.  \n729.  In Missouri, public hospitals are ultimately controlled by the State of \nMissouri and receive state funds.  \n730.  MO HealthNet (Missouri Medicaid) pays a determined rate to public \nhospitals, which in some circumstances may be lower than the hospital’s costs.  \n                                            \n497 https://mydss.mo.gov/media/pdf/out-state-non-bordering-services  \n185 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z     Document 217     Filed 01/16/25      Page 186 of 199     PageID 12418\n731.  Per regulations, those public hospitals agree to accept the payment as \npayment in full, even if it is less than their actual cost. They may not seek further \npayment from the patient.  \n732.  If MO HealthNet pays only a portion of a medical bill, the public hospital \n(an instrumentality of the State) will incur as an expense the difference between the \nfull amount of the medical bill and what was paid. \n733.  If  a  public  hospital  provides  medical  services  for  complications \nstemming from chemical abortions, and the State’s Medicaid program does not cover \nthe full portion of the bill, the outstanding balance is a loss to the public hospital, \nwhich is itself an instrumentality of the State. \n734.  Between January 2018 and August 16, 2023, 55 of the 438 chemical \nabortion complication reports (approximately 1 in 8 of all total chemical abortion \ncomplication reports) were reported by Missouri’s public hospitals.498 \n735.  Under  the  Emergency  Medical  Treatment  and  Active  Labor  Act \n(EMTALA), public hospitals are required to evaluate patients and provide stabilizing \ntreatment in emergency situations, regardless of a patient’s ability to pay. See Moyle \nv.  United  States,  144  S.  Ct.  2015,  2016  (2024)  (Kavanaugh,  J.,  concurring  in \ndismissal).  So, public hospitals cannot choose not to treat women who arrive needing \nemergency treatment after they experience complications from a chemical abortion.  \nF.  The FDA’s actions result in the States paying the costs to public \ninsurance for mental health care for the increasing number of \nwomen suffering negative effects from chemical abortion drugs \n736.  As  with  medical  complications,  Plaintiff  States  also  provide  public \ncoverage of certain mental health expenses such as psychiatry, psychology, and \n                                            \n498 Ex. 95, Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services Affidavit, at 2. \n186 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z     Document 217     Filed 01/16/25      Page 187 of 199     PageID 12419\ncounseling,  including  through  Medicaid  and  public  insurance  programs  for \ngovernment employees.  \n737.  Post-abortion  regret  and  mental  health  effects  are  common,  as \nevidenced  by  the  proliferation  of  counseling  programs  for  suffering  women  in \nchurches and pregnancy resource centers.  \n738.  Some  women  retrospectively  report  that  they  underwent  abortions \nwithout adequate time to consider their actions or without true informed consent.499 \nAnd a recent U.S. study on abortion and coercion found that “[o]ver 60 percent of \nwomen who had abortions report high levels of pressure to abort from one or more \nsources, and those same women report higher levels of subsequent mental health and \nquality of life issues.”500 \n739.  Chemical abortions in particular have devastating mental health effects \nfor women who experience physical trauma at home and without a doctor or other \nsupport persons present, who often view the unborn child as he or she is aborted, or \nby directly participating in the procedure that ends their child’s life.  \n740.  Seeing the unborn child as it is aborted is associated with more intrusive \nevents  such  as  nightmares,  flashbacks,  and  unwanted  thoughts  related  to  the \nexperience. \n741.  Because women are  the direct actor when they take abortion pills, \n(unlike with surgical abortions, where the physician is the direct actor) women who \n                                            \n499 Ex. 13, Katherine A. Rafferty & Tessa Longbons, #AbortionChangesYou: A Case \nStudy to Understand the Communicative Tensions in Women’s Medication Abortion \nNarratives, 36 Health Commc’n 1485 (2020), DOI: 10.1080/10410236.2020.1770507. \n500 Ex. 106, David C. Reardon & Tessa Longbons, Whose Choice? Pressure to Abort \nLinked to Worsening of Subsequent Mental Health, Charlotte Lozier Inst.

Women  who  choose  chemical  abortion  are  more  likely  to  continue \nassociating their homes, or the bathroom, with abortion. The home may become a \ntrigger for uncomfortable emotions rather than a refuge. \n743.  Women who choose chemical abortion over surgical exhibit significantly \nhigher rates of mental health issues, such as obsessive-compulsive symptoms, guilt, \ninterpersonal  sensitivity  issues,  paranoid  ideation,  and  general \npsychological/psychiatric symptoms. \n744.  And mifepristone itself releases inflammatory cytokines, which have \nbeen identified as contributing to depression. In one rat model, the group of pregnant \nrats  given  mifepristone  had  significantly  decreased  body  weight,  food  intake, \nlocomotor-related activity, and sucrose consumption, which are all animal proxies for \ndepression and anxiety.501 \n745.  As a result of these and other factors, women who obtain chemical \nabortions are more likely to seek and need general mental health services, including \nwomen who obtain publicly funded mental health services.  \nXXIII.  Sovereign Injuries to Plaintiffs’ Population Interests \n746.  Plaintiff  States  also  suffer  injuries  from  the  loss  of  fetal  life  and \npotential births, leading to a resulting reduction in the actual or potential population \nof each state.  \n                                            \n501  Ex.  107,  Christina  Camilleri  et  al.,  Biological,  Behavioral  and  Physiological \nConsequences of Drug-Induced Pregnancy Termination at First-Trimester Human \nEquivalent in an Animal Model, 13 Frontiers in Neurosci. 544 (2019). \n188 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z     Document 217     Filed 01/16/25      Page 189 of 199     PageID 12421\n747.  Defendants’  actions  are  causing  a  loss  in  potential  population  or \npotential population increase. Each abortion represents at least one lost potential or \nactual birth.  \n748.  The Supreme Court has recognized “the legitimacy of the States' interest \nin protecting fetal life.” Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Org., 597 U.S. 215, 262 \n(2022). States’ “legitimate interests include respect for and preservation of prenatal \nlife at all stages of development.” Id. at 301.  \n749.  Defendants’ efforts enabling the remote dispensing of abortion drugs \nhas caused abortions for women in Plaintiff States and decreased births in Plaintiff \nStates. This is a sovereign injury to the State in itself.  \n750.  One study highlighted that the removal of in-person follow-up visits has \nan effect on birth rates. In Missouri, state laws result “in an average increase in \ndriving distance of 2.2 miles” for an in-person out-of-state dispensing of abortion \ndrugs, “compared to a 453-mile increase in Texas, illustrating that states with the \ngreatest  increases  in  driving  distance  also  tend  to  have  the  greatest  estimated \nincreases in births.502 That is because it is relatively easy for a Missouri woman to \ndrive to Illinois or Kansas than for a Texas woman to drive to New Mexico or \nColorado. Reflecting the ease of driving to another state to receive abortion drugs, it \nis estimated that just 2.4 percent of abortion-minded women were prevented from \ngetting abortions” in Missouri after Dobbs.503 This data thus reflects the FDA’s \nremoval of a requirement for three in-person doctor visits.  \n751.  These estimates also show the effect of the FDA’s decision to remove all \nin-person dispensing protections. When data is examined in a way that reflects \n                                            \n502 Daniel Dench et al., The Effects of the Dobbs Decision on Fertility, Inst. of Labor \nEconomics, IZA DP No. 16608 at 12 (Nov. 2023), https://docs.iza.org/dp16608.pdf.  \n503 Id. \n189 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z     Document 217     Filed 01/16/25      Page 190 of 199     PageID 12422\nsensitivity to expected birth rates, these estimates strikingly “do not show evidence \nof an increase in births to teenagers aged 15-19,” even in states with long driving \ndistances despite the fact that “women aged 15-19 … are more responsive to driving \ndistances to abortion facilities than older women.”504 The study thus concludes that \n“one explanation may be that younger women are more likely to navigate online \nabortion  finders  or  websites  ordering  mail-order  medication  to  self-manage \nabortions.505 This study thus suggests that remote dispensing of abortion drugs by \nmail, common carrier, and interactive computer service is depressing expected birth \nrates for teenaged mothers in Plaintiff States, even if other overall birth rates may \nhave been lower than otherwise was projected. \n752.  A loss of potential population causes further injuries as well: the States \nsubsequent “diminishment of political representation” and “loss of federal funds,” \nsuch as potentially “losing a seat in Congress or qualifying for less federal funding if \ntheir populations are” reduced or their increase diminished. Dep’t of Com. v. New \nYork, 588 U.S. 752, 766–67, (2019). \nXXIV. Injury from 2019 approval of generic mifepristone \n753.  The same is true of the 2019 Generic Approval. By approving a generic \nversion of the drug, the FDA increased supply and availability, lowering cost and thus \nincreasing use of chemical abortions.506  \n754.  As a direct result of the FDA’s decision to approve the 2019 generic \nversion  of  mifepristone,  “third  parties  [have]  react[ed]  in  predictable  ways,” \n                                            \n504 Id. \n505 Id. \n506 Ex. 108, Solanky Affidavit. \n190 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z     Document 217     Filed 01/16/25      Page 191 of 199     PageID 12423\nincreasing the use of chemical abortion compared to surgical abortion. Dep’t of Com. \nv. New York, 139 S. Ct. 2551, 2566 (2019). \n755.  The number of women obtaining chemical abortions has increased as a \nresult  of  the  2019  generic  approval,507  and  thus  the  “the  number  of  women \nexperiencing medical complications after taking mifepristone has risen as a result of \nthe generic” approval, All. for Hippocratic Med. v. U.S. Food & Drug Admin., 78 F.4th \n210, 241 (5th Cir. 2023). \n756.  Because Plaintiff States experience harm, as explained below, from the \nuse of chemical abortions, the 2019 generic approval aggravates and worsens Plaintiff \nStates’ harms. \nFIRST CLAIM \n \nThe Challenged 2016 Major Changes \n \nUltra Vires; Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. § 706)  \n \nIn Excess of Statutory Jurisdiction, Authority, or Limitations, or Short of \nStatutory Right; Arbitrary, Capricious, An Abuse of Discretion, or \nOtherwise Not in Accordance with Law \n757.  Plaintiffs  re-allege  and  incorporate,  as  though  fully  set  forth, \nparagraphs 1 to 756 of this complaint. \n758.  The FDA lacked legal authority when issuing the challenged 2016 Major \nChanges.  \n759.  The FDA’s illegal and unreasonable rationales for the challenged 2016 \nMajor Changes—in light of the political context of the agency’s actions—indicate that \nthe stated reasons are pretext. Therefore, they are arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of \ndiscretion, and otherwise not in accordance with law in violation of the APA. 5 U.S.C. \n§ 706(2)(A). \n                                            \n507 Id. \n191 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z     Document 217     Filed 01/16/25      Page 192 of 199     PageID 12424\n760.  The challenged 2016 Major Changes were unlawful because the FDA \nacknowledged that they were “interrelated,” but failed to explain why the agency did \nnot consider the cumulative impact of removing them all at once or why the agency \ncould extrapolate safety conclusions for its omnibus changes from studies that did not \nevaluate those changes as a whole. \n761.  The FDA’s actions seek to enable the violation of state laws restricting \nabortion, as described above. But a federal agency cannot disregard applicable state \nlaw or seek to enable and encourage what state law expressly prohibits, so the FDA \nlacked  legal  authority  and  acted  arbitrarily  and  capriciously  when  issuing  the \nchallenged 2016 Major Changes.  \n762.  Therefore, the challenged 2016 Major Changes, and, by necessity, the \n2019 Mifepristone REMS Program and the 2021/2023 Removal of the In-Person \nDispensing  Protection  must  be  held  unlawful,  stayed,  set  aside,  vacated,  and \npreliminarily and permanently enjoined under the APA and the Court’s inherent \nequitable power to enjoin ultra vires actions, Larson, 337 U.S. at 689–91. \nSECOND CLAIM \n2019 MIFEPRISTONE REMS PROGRAM AND 2019 ANDA APPROVAL \nULTRA VIRES; ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT (5 U.S.C. § 706)  \n \nIN EXCESS OF STATUTORY JURISDICTION, AUTHORITY, OR \nLIMITATIONS, OR SHORT OF STATUTORY RIGHT; ARBITRARY, \nCAPRICIOUS, AN ABUSE OF DISCRETION, OR OTHERWISE NOT IN \nACCORDANCE WITH LAW \n763.  Plaintiffs  re-allege  and  incorporate,  as  though  fully  set  forth, \nparagraphs 1 to 762 of this complaint. \n764.  The FDA lacked legal authority when issuing the 2019 Mifepristone \nShared REMS Program and 2019 ANDA Approval. \n192 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z     Document 217     Filed 01/16/25      Page 193 of 199     PageID 12425\n765.  The FDA’s illegal and unreasonable rationales for the 2019 Mifepristone \nShared REMS Program and 2019 ANDA Approval—in light of the political context of \nthe agency’s actions—indicate that the stated reasons are pretext. Therefore, they \nare arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, and otherwise not in accordance with \nlaw in violation of the APA. 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \n766.  The FDA’s actions seek to enable the violation of state laws restricting \nabortion, as described above. But a federal agency cannot disregard applicable state \nlaw or seek to enable and encourage what state law expressly prohibits, so the FDA \nlacked legal authority and acted arbitrarily and capriciously when issuing the 2019 \nMifepristone Shared REMS Program and 2019 ANDA Approval.  \n767.  Therefore,  the  2019  Mifepristone  Shared  REMS  Program  and  2019 \nANDA Approval must be held unlawful, stayed, set aside, vacated, and preliminarily \nand permanently enjoined under the APA and the Court’s inherent equitable power \nto enjoin ultra vires actions, Larson, 337 U.S. at 689–91. \nTHIRD CLAIM \n2021/2023 REMOVAL OF THE IN-PERSON DISPENSING PROTECTION, \nINCLUDING THE PHARMACY AUTHORIZATION \nULTRA VIRES; ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT (5 U.S.C. § 706)  \n \nIN EXCESS OF STATUTORY JURISDICTION, AUTHORITY, OR \nLIMITATIONS, OR SHORT OF STATUTORY RIGHT; ARBITRARY, \nCAPRICIOUS, AN ABUSE OF DISCRETION, OR OTHERWISE NOT IN \nACCORDANCE WITH LAW \n768.  Plaintiffs  re-allege  and  incorporate,  as  though  fully  set  forth, \nparagraphs 1 to 767 of this complaint. \n769.  The FDA lacked legal authority when issuing the 2021/2023 Removal of \nthe  In-Person  Dispensing  Protection  (consisting  of  the  2021  Non-Enforcement \n193 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z     Document 217     Filed 01/16/25      Page 194 of 199     PageID 12426\nDecision, the 2023 Removal of In-Person Dispensing Requirement, and the Pharmacy \nAuthorization). \n770.  The FDA’s 2021/2023 Removal of the In-Person Dispensing Protection \nviolates the federal laws that expressly prohibit the mailing or delivery by any letter \ncarrier,  express  company,  or  other  common  carrier,  or  by  interactive  computer \nservice, of any substance or drug intended for producing abortion. 18 U.S.C. §§ 1461–\n62. \n771.  The FDA’s 2021/2023 Removal of the In-Person Dispensing Protection \nviolated  these  federal  laws  because  they  impermissibly  removed  the  in-person \ndispensing  requirement  for  abortion  drugs  and,  accordingly,  authorized  the \ndownstream distribution of abortion drugs by mail, express company, other common \ncarriers, and interactive computer service. \n772.  Because a federal agency cannot permit what federal law expressly \nprohibits, the FDA lacked legal authority when issuing the 2021/2023 Removal of the \nIn-Person Dispensing Protection. \n773.  The  FDA’s  illegal  and  unreasonable  rationales  for  the  2021/2023 \nRemoval of the In-Person Dispensing Protection —in light of the political context of \nthe agency’s actions—indicate that the stated reasons are pretext. Therefore, they \nare arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, and otherwise not in accordance with \nlaw in violation of the APA. 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \n774.  The 2021/2023 Removal of the In-Person Dispensing Protection are also \nunlawful because they were based on adverse event data that the FDA elsewhere \nrecognizes as unreliable and studies that it considered “not adequate” on their own \nto establish the safety of dispensing mifepristone by mail. \n775.  The FDA’s actions seek to enable the violation of state laws restricting \nabortion, as described above. But a federal agency cannot disregard applicable state \nlaw or seek to enable and encourage what state law expressly prohibits, so the FDA \n194 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z     Document 217     Filed 01/16/25      Page 195 of 199     PageID 12427\nlacked  legal  authority  and  acted  arbitrarily  and  capriciously  when  issuing  the  \n2021/2023 Removal of the In-Person Dispensing Protection.  \n776.  Therefore,  the  2021/2023  Removal  of  the  In-Person  Dispensing \nProtection must be held unlawful, stayed, set aside, vacated, and preliminarily and \npermanently enjoined under the APA and the Court’s inherent equitable power to \nenjoin ultra vires actions, Larson, 337 U.S. at 689–91. \nFOURTH CLAIM \n \nThe Challenged 2016 Major Changes \n \nAdministrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. § 706) \n \nIn Excess of Statutory Jurisdiction, Authority, or Limitations, or Short of \nStatutory Right; Arbitrary, Capricious, An Abuse of Discretion, of \nOtherwise Not in Accordance with Law \n777.  Plaintiffs  re-allege  and  incorporate,  as  though  fully  set  forth,  all \nparagraphs 1 to 776 of this complaint. \n778.  Defendants lacked legal authority to make the 2016 Major Changes. \n779.  The FDA lacked legal authority under PREA to make the challenged \n2016 Major Changes, and the challenged 2016 Major Changes were in excess of \nstatutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right, and were \narbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, and not in accordance with law, because \nPREA allows the FDA to extrapolate from studies of adult populations only if the \ncourse of a “disease” is substantially similar in adults and the pediatric population. \nBecause pregnancy is not a disease, PREA did not permit the FDA to make such an \nextrapolation. \n780.  Defendants lacked legal authority under PREA to make the challenged \n2016  Major Changes and the challenged 2016 Major Changes were in excess of \nstatutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right, and were \n195 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z     Document 217     Filed 01/16/25      Page 196 of 199     PageID 12428\narbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, and not in accordance with law, because \nthe FDA did not require an assessment that evaluated the safety and effectiveness of \nmifepristone for girls under 18 years of age. \n781.  For the reasons stated above, the challenged 2016 Major Changes must \nbe held unlawful, stayed, set aside, vacated, and  preliminarily and permanently \nenjoined. \n782.  Because the challenged 2016 Major Changes were unlawful, the FDA’s \n2019 action to create a single, shared REMS—the Mifepristone REMS Program—for \nboth Mifeprex and generic mifepristone must also be held unlawful, stayed, set aside, \nvacated, and preliminarily and permanently enjoined. \nFIFTH CLAIM \n \n2019 Abbreviated New Drug Approval \n \nAdministrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. § 706) \n \nIn Excess of Statutory Jurisdiction, Authority, or Limitations, or Short of \nStatutory Right; Arbitrary, Capricious, An Abuse Of Discretion, or \nOtherwise Not in Accordance with Law \n783.  Plaintiffs  re-allege  and  incorporate,  as  though  fully  set  forth,  all \nparagraphs 1 to 782 of this complaint. \n784.  Defendants lacked legal authority to issue the 2019 ANDA Approval. \n785.  Because the FDA relied on the unlawful 2016 Major Changes labeling \nas a means to approve GenBioPro’s generic drug, Mifepristone Tablets, 200 mg, the \n2019 ANDA Approval was unlawfully approved. \n786.  Unable to rely on an unlawful approval, the FDA’s 2019 ANDA Approval \nviolated the FDCA because it lacked the clinical investigations, adequate testing, \nsufficient information, and substantial evidence to show the safety and effectiveness \n196 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z     Document 217     Filed 01/16/25      Page 197 of 199     PageID 12429\nof mifepristone under the conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in \nthe proposed labeling thereof as required by 21 U.S.C. § 355(d). \n787.  Therefore, the 2019 ANDA Approval must be held unlawful, set aside, \nvacated, and preliminarily and permanently enjoined.  \n788.  GenBioPro may submit an application with proposed labeling consistent \nwith the pre-2016 Major Changes labeling, but, unlike Danco, GenBioPro cannot \nsimply revert to a previously approved label. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nFor these reasons, Plaintiff States respectfully request that the Court enter an \norder  and  judgment  against  Defendants,  including  their  employees,  agents, \nsuccessors, and all persons in active concert or participation with them, in which it: \nA.  Issues a preliminary injunction or a stay of the effective dates that  \n1.  reinstates the REMS that were in place before 2016 insofar as \nthey restore the Day 3 and Day 14 follow-up visits, restore the \ngestational age to 7 weeks from 10 weeks, restore the requirement \nthat prescribers be physicians, and restore the requirement that \nprescribers must report all serious non-fatal adverse events to the \nagency;  \n2.  rescinds the 2019 generic approval; and \n3.  restores the in-person dispensing requirement. \nB.  Issues  a  permanent  injunction  ordering  Defendants  to  withdraw \nDefendants’ actions to deregulate these abortion drugs. \nC.  Holds  unlawful,  sets  aside,  and  vacates  the  challenged  2016  Major \nChanges. \n197 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z     Document 217     Filed 01/16/25      Page 198 of 199     PageID 12430\nD.  Holds unlawful, sets aside, and vacates the 2019 ANDA Approval. \nE.  Holds unlawful, sets aside, and vacates the 2021/2023 Removal of the \nIn-Person  Dispensing  Protection,  including  the  Pharmacy \nAuthorization. \nF.  Holds unlawful the provision of drugs to adolescent populations because \nthe  FDA  lacked  authority  under  §  355c(a)(2)(B)(i)  to  extrapolate \npediatric effectiveness. \nG.  Declares that the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act prohibits the \nFDA from relying exclusively on studies that fail to evaluate the safety \nof interrelated changes in the proposed labeling thereof when reviewing \nand approving a supplemental new drug application without explaining \nwhy it was permissible to do so. \nH.  Declares that 18 U.S.C. § 1461 and 18 U.S.C. § 1462 prohibit the FDA \nfrom approving a supplemental new drug application that fails to limit \ndistribution of abortion drugs in accordance with these laws. \nI.  Retains jurisdiction of this matter for the purpose of enforcing this \nCourt’s order. \nJ.  Awards Plaintiffs’ costs, attorneys’ fees, and other disbursements for \nthis action. \nK.  Grants  any  other  relief  this  Court  deems  equitable,  just,  and \nappropriate. \n   \n198 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z     Document 217     Filed 01/16/25      Page 199 of 199     PageID 12431\nRespectfully submitted this 11th day of October, 2024. \nANDREW BAILEY  RAÚL R.

Intervenor  Plaintiffs  request  leave  to  amend  “to \nprovide  greater  factual  support  for  the  theories  presented  in  the  initial  complaint.”  ECF  No.  195  at  1. \nDefendants and  Intervenor Defendant oppose the  Motion.  /d.  at 2. \nFederal  Rule  of Civil  Procedure  15(a)  governs  amendment  prior to  trial.  A  “party  may  amend \nits  pleading  only  with  the  opposing  party’s  written  consent  or  the  court’s  leave.  The  court  should \nfreely  give  leave  when justice  so  requires.”  FED.  R.  Civ.  P.  15(a)(2).  The  presumption  is  that  a  court \ngrants  leave  unless  it  “possess[es]  a  ‘substantial  reason’  to  deny  a party’s  request  for  leave  to  amend.” \nMarucci  Sports,  L.L.C.  v.  Nat’l  Collegiate Athletic Ass'n,  751  F.3d  368,  378  (Sth  Cir.  2014)  (quoting \nJones  v.  Robinson  Prop.  Grp.,  L.P.,  427  F.3d  987,  994  (Sth  Cir.  2005).  A  district  court  has  discretion \nwhether to  grant  a motion  for  leave  to  amend  or not.  Quintanilla  v.  Tex.  Television  Inc.,  139  F.3d  494, \n499  (Sth  Cir.  1998).  In  exercising  its  discretion,  a  court  examines  “if there  is  undue  delay,  bad  faith  or\n\n   \nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z     Document 215     Filed 01/16/25      Page 2 of 4     PageID 12228\ndilatory  motive,  undue prejudice  or futility  of the  amendment.”  Dussouy  v.  Gulf Coast Inv.  Corp.,  660 \nF.2d  594,  597  (Former  5th  Cir.  1981).  If  a  court  denied  leave  to  amend  due  to  futility,  it  is  not  an \nabuse  of discretion.  Briggs  v.  Mississippi,  331  F.3d  499,  508  (5th  Cir.  2003).  “An  amendment  is  futile \nif it would  fail  to  survive  a Rule  12(b)(6)  motion.” Marucci Sports,  751  F.3d  at  378  (citing Briggs,  331 \nF.3d at  508). \nDefendants  and  Intervenor  Defendant  do  not  argue  that  leave  to  amend  should  be  denied  due \nto  undue  delay,  bad  faith  or  dilatory  move,  or  undue  prejudice.  See  ECF  Nos.  198;  201;  211;  212. \nInstead,  they  argue  that  amendment  would  be  futile  here  because  Intervenor  Plaintiffs  lack  venue. \nECF Nos.  198  at  20;  201  at  10.  They  claim  that  the  Intervenor  Plaintiffs  lack  any  relevant  connection \nto  the  Northern  District  of Texas  and  that  courts  sometimes  deny  leave  to  amend  on  venue  grounds. \nRecall  that  an  amendment  is  only  futile  if it  would  fail  to  survive  a  motion  to  dismiss  standard.  The \nnonbinding  cases  that  Defendants  and  Intervenor  Defendant  cite  meet  this  standard.  The  court  in \nHamilton  v,  Duke  Energy  Bus.  Servs.,  LLC had  already  dismissed  the  action  for  lack  of venue  and  so \ncleared  the  motion  to  dismiss  standard.  No.  4:21-cv-4070,  2023  WL  2332248,  at  *4  (S.D.  Tex.  Mar. \n1,  2023).  In  Chavez  v.  First National Bank of South Africa,  the  court  denied  leave  to  amend  because  a \nvalid  forum  selection  clause  governed  and  would  cause  any  amendment  to  still  fail  a  motion  to \ndismiss.  No.  DR-15-CV-065,  2015  WL  13036708,  at  *4  (W.D.  Tex.  Nov.  24,  2015).  And  in  Total \nSafety  U.S.,  Inc.  v.  Rowland, the  court denied leave to  amend because a  party  failed to  allege  an LLC’s \nmembers’  residency  in  the  appropriate  district  and  further  failed  to  dispute  that  none  of the  claims \n    \noccurred  in  the  court’s  district.  No.  13-6109,  2014  WL  4693114,  at  *8  (E.D.  La.  Sept.  22,  2014).  Of \ncourse,  such  basic  shortfalls  would  fail  a  motion  to  dismiss  standard.  Defendants  and  Intervenor \nDefendant  deftly  quote  lines  to  seemingly  further  their  position  but  do  not  further  examine  their \nnonbinding  cases  to  evaluate  whether they  are truly  persuasive to  their position.\n\n  \nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z     Document 215     Filed 01/16/25      Page 3 of 4     PageID 12229\nHere,  Defendants  and  Intervenor  Defendant  fail  to  show  that  Intervenor  Plaintiffs’  Amended \nComplaint  would  surely  fail  a  motion  to  dismiss.  The  Rule  15(a)  standard  for  leave  to  amend  is \n“liberal”  and  a  court  needs  a  “substantial  reason”  to  deny  leave.  S&W Enters.,  L.L.C.  v.  SouthTrust \nBank  of Ala,  NA,  315  F.3d  533,  536  (Sth  Cir.  2003);  Marucci  Sports,  751  F.3d  at  378  (internal \nquotation omitted).  Leave  to  amend  is  “by  no  means  automatic.”  Halbert v.  City  of Sherman,  33  F.3d \n526,  529  (Sth  Cir.  1994).  But  there  is  a  “bias  in  favor  of granting  leave  to  amend.”  Lyn-Lea  Travel \nCorp.  v.  Am.  Airlines,  283  F.3d  282,  286  (Sth  Cir.  2002).  Considering  Rule  15(a)’s  high  standard  for \ndenying  leave  to  amend,  Defendants’  failure  to  conclusively  demonstrate  that  venue  disputes  at  this \njuncture  would  render  amendment  fully  futile  does  not  provide  the  Court  with  a  “substantial  reason” \nto  deny  leave.  Unlike  in  the  cases  Defendants  and  Intervenor  Defendant  cite,  venue  remains  disputed \nhere  and  should  be  properly  dealt  with  at  a  phase  where  each  party  may  fully  argue  the  issue. \nAccordingly,  the  Court  GRANTS  Intervenor  Plaintiffs’  Motion.  The  Court  ORDERS  Intervenor \nPlaintiffs  to  file  the  amended  complaint  and  accompanying  exhibits  found  at  ECF  No.  195-1  to  195-7 \nas  a  separately  filed amended  complaint  and exhibits. \nDefendants  and  Intervenor  Defendant  have  pending  Motions  to  Dismiss  against  the  original \nplaintiffs  and  Intervenor  Plaintiffs.  The  original  plaintiffs  have  since  voluntarily  dismissed  their \nclaims.  ECF No.  206.  And following  this  Order,  Intervenor  Plaintiffs  will  file  an Amended  Complaint. \nAs  a  substantial  portion  of the  pending  motions  to  dismiss  focus  on  original  plaintiffs’  complaint  and \nthe  only  remaining  complaint  in  this  action  will  soon  be  amended,  the  Court  DENIES  as  MOOT  the \npending  motions  to  dismiss  (ECF  No.  196  and  ECF  No.  199).  See  Bridgestone Ams.  Tire  Operations, \nLLC v.  Speedways  Tyres Ltd.,  No.  4:22-cv-0145,  2023  WL  2574576,  at  *2  (N.D.  Tex.  Mar.  20,  2023) \n(‘An  amended  complaint  generally  renders  pending  motions  moot.”);  Garza-Selcer  v.  1600  Pac. \nSubtenant,  LLC,  No.  3:15-cv-03791,  2016  WL  11474103,  at  *2  (N.D.  Tex.  Aug.  30,  2016)  (“When  a\n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z     Document 215     Filed 01/16/25      Page 4 of 4     PageID 12230\nmotion  to  dismiss  is  filed  against  a  superseded  complaint,  courts  ordinarily  deny  the  motions  as \nmoot.”).  Renewed  motions  to  dismiss  in  response  to  Intervenor  Plaintiffs’  forthcoming  amended \ncomplaint  will  provide  Defendants  and  Intervenor Defendant  opportunity  to  focus  their arguments  and \nspace  on the  one  complaint remaining  in this  action. \nSO  ORDERED.  a \nJanuary  /@,  2025 \n MATTHEW  J.

ALLIANCE FOR \nHIPPOCRATIC MEDICINE, ET AL. \nON APPLICATION FOR STAY \n_________________ \nNo. 22A902 \n_________________ \nFOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION, ET AL. v. \nALLIANCE FOR HIPPOCRATIC MEDICINE, ET AL. \nON APPLICATION FOR STAY \n[April 21, 2023] \n  The applications for stays presented to JUSTICE ALITO \nand by him referred to the Court are granted.  The April 7, \n2023  order  of  the  United  States  District  Court  for  the \nNorthern District of Texas, case No. 2:22–cv–223, is stayed \npending  disposition  of  the  appeal  in  the  United  States \nCourt of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit and disposition of a \npetition for a writ of certiorari, if such a writ is timely \nsought.  Should certiorari be denied, this stay shall termi-\nnate automatically.  In the event certiorari is granted, the \nstay shall terminate upon the sending down of the judg-\nment of this Court. \n  JUSTICE THOMAS would deny the applications for stays. \n  JUSTICE ALITO, dissenting from grant of applications for \nstays. \n  In recent cases, this Court has been lambasted for staying \na District Court order “based on the scanty review this \nCourt gives matters on its shadow docket,” Merrill v. Milli-\ngan, 595 U. S. ___, ___ (2022) (KAGAN, J., dissenting) (slip \n \n\n2  DANCO LABORATORIES, LLC v. ALLIANCE FOR \n  HIPPOCRATIC MEDICINE \nALITO, J., dissenting \nop., at 2).  In another, we were criticized for ruling on a stay \napplication while “barely bother[ing] to explain [our] con-\nclusion,” a disposition that was labeled as “emblematic of \ntoo much of this Court’s shadow-docket decisionmaking—\nwhich  every  day  becomes  more  unreasoned.”    Whole \nWoman’s Health v. Jackson, 594 U. S. ___, ___–___ (2021) \n(KAGAN, J., dissenting from denial of application for injunc-\ntive relief) (slip op., at 1–2).  And in a third case in which a \nstay was granted, we were condemned for not exhibiting the \n“restraint” that was supposedly exercised in the past and \nfor not “resisting” the Government’s effort to “shortcut” nor-\nmal process.  Barr v. East Bay Sanctuary Covenant, 588 \nU. S. ___, ___ (2019) (SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting) (slip op., \nat 5).  Cf. Does 1–3 v. Mills, 595 U. S. ___, ___ (2021) \n(BARRETT, J., concurring in denial of application for injunc-\ntive relief) (slip op., at 1) (warning that the Court should \nnot act “on a short fuse without benefit of full briefing and \noral argument” in a case that is “first to address the ques-\ntions presented”). \n  I did not agree with these criticisms at the time, but if \nthey were warranted in the cases in which they were made, \nthey are emphatically true here.  As narrowed by the Court \nof Appeals, the stay that would apply if we failed to broaden \nit would not remove mifepristone from the market.  It would \nsimply restore the circumstances that existed (and that the \nGovernment defended) from 2000 to 2016 under three Pres-\nidential administrations.  In addition, because the appli-\ncants’ Fifth Circuit appeal has been put on a fast track, with \noral argument scheduled to take place in 26 days, there is \nreason to believe that they would get the relief they now \nseek—from either the Court of Appeals or this Court—in \nthe near future if their arguments on the merits are per-\nsuasive. \n  At present, the applicants are not entitled to a stay be-\ncause they have not shown that they are likely to suffer ir-\nreparable harm in the interim.  The applicants claim that \n \n\n  Cite as: 598 U. S. ____ (2023)  3 \n \nALITO, J., dissenting \nregulatory “chaos” would occur due to an alleged conflict be-\ntween the relief awarded in these cases and the relief pro-\nvided by a decision of the United States District Court for \nthe Eastern District of Washington.  It is not clear that \nthere actually is a conflict because the relief in these cases \nis a stay, not an injunction, but even if there is a conflict, \nthat should not be given any weight.  Our granting of a stay \nof a lower-court decision is an equitable remedy.  It should \nnot be given if the moving party has not acted equitably, \nand that is the situation here.  The Food and Drug Admin-\nistration (FDA) has engaged in what has become the prac-\ntice of “leverag[ing]” district court injunctions “as a basis” \nfor implementing a desired policy while evading both nec-\nessary agency procedures and judicial review.  Arizona v. \nCity and County of San Francisco, 596 U. S. ___, ___ (2022) \n(ROBERTS, C. J., concurring) (slip op., at 2). \n  The Washington District Court enjoined the FDA from \naltering its current practice regarding mifepristone—some-\nthing that the FDA had never hinted it was contemplating.  \nThe FDA did not appeal that appealable order, and when \nseven States that might take such an appeal asked to inter-\nvene, the FDA opposed their request.  This series of events \nlaid the foundation for the Government’s regulatory “chaos” \nargument. \n  Once this argument is put aside, the applicants’ argu-\nment on irreparable harm is largely reduced to the claim \nthat Danco could not continue to market mifepristone be-\ncause the drug would be mislabeled and that distribution \ncould not resume until Danco jumped through a series of \nregulatory steps that would be largely perfunctory under \npresent circumstances.  That would not take place, how-\never, unless the FDA elected to use its enforcement discre-\ntion to stop Danco, and the applicants’ papers do not pro-\nvide any reason to believe the FDA would make that choice.  \nThe FDA has previously invoked enforcement discretion to \npermit the distribution of mifepristone in a way that the \n \n\n4  DANCO LABORATORIES, LLC v. ALLIANCE FOR \n  HIPPOCRATIC MEDICINE \nALITO, J., dissenting \nregulations then in force prohibited, and here, the Govern-\nment has not dispelled legitimate doubts that it would even \nobey an unfavorable order in these cases, much less that it \nwould choose to take enforcement actions to which it has \nstrong objections. \n  For these reasons, I would deny the stay applications.  \nContrary to the impression that may be held by many, that \ndisposition would not express any view on the merits of the \nquestion whether the FDA acted lawfully in any of its ac-\ntions regarding mifepristone.  Rather, it would simply re-\nfuse to take a step that has not been shown as necessary to \navoid the threat of any real harm during the presumably \nshort period at issue. \n ",

At this \npreliminary stage, and based on our necessarily abbreviated review, it appears \nthat the statute of limitations bars plaintiffs’ challenges to the Food and Drug \nAdministration’s approval of mifepristone in 2000. In the district court, \nhowever,  plaintiffs  brought  a  series  of  alternative  arguments  regarding \nFDA’s  actions  in  2016  and  subsequent  years.  And  the  district  court \nemphasized that its order separately applied to prohibit FDA’s actions in and \nafter 2016 in accordance with plaintiffs’ alternative arguments. As to those \nalternative arguments, plaintiffs’ claims are timely. Defendants have not \nshown that plaintiffs are unlikely to succeed on the merits of their timely \nchallenges. For that reason, and as more fully explained below, defendants’ \nmotions for a stay pending appeal are DENIED IN PART. Defendants’ \nalternative motions for an administrative stay are DENIED AS MOOT. \nPlaintiffs’  motion  to  dismiss  the  appeal  is  DENIED.  The  appeal  is \nEXPEDITED to the next available Oral Argument Calendar. \n_____________________ \n∗ Judge Haynes concurs only in part: she concurs in the grant of the expedited \nappeal and the denial of the motion to dismiss. With respect to the request for a stay of the \ndistrict court’s order, as a member of the motions panel, she would grant an administrative \nstay for a brief period of time and defer the question of the stay pending appeal to the oral \nargument merits panel which receives this case. \n2 \n\nCase: 23-10362      Document: 00516710351     Page: 3     Date Filed: 04/12/2023\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 141   Filed 04/12/23    Page 3 of 42   PageID 4496\nNo. 23-10362 \nI. \nA. \nCongress delegated to the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) \nthe responsibility to ensure that “new drugs” are “safe and effective.” 21 \nU.S.C. §§ 321(p), 355; see also id. § 393(b)(2)(B). When making its approval \ndetermination, FDA evaluates whether a new drug application (“NDA”) \nincludes scientific evidence demonstrating that the drug is safe and effective \nfor its intended uses. Id. § 355(d); see also 21 C.F.R. §§ 314.50, 314.105(c). \nSimilarly, when a sponsor submits a supplemental new drug application \n(“SNDA”) proposing changes to the conditions of approval for a drug (such \nas changes to a drug’s labeling or FDA-imposed restrictions), FDA reviews \nthe scientific evidence to support the changes. See 21 C.F.R. § 314.70. To \napprove  a  generic  version  of  a  previously  approved  drug,  FDA  reviews \nwhether  an  abbreviated  new  drug  application  (“ANDA”)  contains \ninformation showing that the proposed generic drug is materially the “same” \nas the approved drug. 21 U.S.C. § 355(j)(2). \nIn 1992, FDA promulgated the so-called “Subpart H” regulations. \nSubpart H accelerates approval of drugs “that have been studied for their \nsafety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and \nthat  provide  meaningful  therapeutic  benefit  to  patients  over  existing \ntreatments (e.g., ability to treat patients unresponsive to, or intolerant of, \navailable therapy, or improved patient response over available therapy).” 21 \nC.F.R. § 314.500. Originally, Subpart H was intended to promote rapid \napproval for life-saving HIV-AIDS drugs. But given that Subpart H approvals \nwere accelerated, FDA recognized that it would need post-approval safety \nmeasures. These post-approval safety measures would “assure safe use” of \nthe quickly approved Subpart H drugs. Id. § 314.520. In 2007, Congress \nratified  these  post-approval  safety  measures  as  “risk  evaluation  and \n3 \n\nCase: 23-10362      Document: 00516710351     Page: 4     Date Filed: 04/12/2023\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 141   Filed 04/12/23    Page 4 of 42   PageID 4497\nNo. 23-10362 \nmitigation strategies” (“REMS”), which “ensure that the benefits of the \ndrug outweigh the risks.” 21 U.S.C. § 355-1(a)(1)–(2). \nB. \nIn 2000, FDA approved mifepristone to be marketed with the brand \nname Mifeprex under Subpart H (the “2000 Approval”). See 21 C.F.R. \n§ 314.500; FDA Add. 181.1 In the 2000 Approval, FDA concluded that \npregnancy is a “life-threatening illness,” triggering an accelerated approval \nof mifepristone under Subpart H. FDA Add. 186. FDA also concluded that a \nvariety of post-approval restrictions on Mifeprex were required “to assure \nsafe use.” 21 C.F.R. § 314.520. As noted in the previous section, today we \ncall such post-approval restrictions “REMS.” The 2000 Approval imposed \nseveral REMS, including: (1) limiting the drug to pregnant women and girls \nfor use through 49 days gestation; (2) requiring three in-person office visits, \nthe first to administer mifepristone, the second to administer misoprostol, \nand the third to assess any complications and ensure there were no fetal \nremains in the womb; (3) requiring the supervision of a qualified physician; \nand (4) requiring the reporting of all adverse events from the drugs. FDA \nAdd. 181–91. FDA granted Danco Laboratories, LLC, an exclusive license to \nmanufacture, market, and distribute Mifeprex in the United States. FDA \nAdd. 109. \nIn 2002, two of the plaintiff associations in this case filed a citizen \npetition challenging the 2000 Approval (the “2002 Citizen Petition”). See \n21 C.F.R. § 10.25(a); PI App. 280–375. Roughly fourteen years later, FDA \ndenied the 2002 Citizen Petition (the “2016 Petition Denial”). FDA Add. \n_____________________ \n1 Citations to the addendum to FDA’s emergency motion for a stay pending appeal \nare denoted “FDA Add.” Citations to the appendix to plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary \ninjunction are denoted “PI App.” \n4 \n\nCase: 23-10362      Document: 00516710351     Page: 5     Date Filed: 04/12/2023\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 141   Filed 04/12/23    Page 5 of 42   PageID 4498\nNo. 23-10362 \n804–36. And on the very same day in March 2016, FDA approved several \nmajor changes to mifepristone’s approved conditions of use, including its \nREMS. Specifically, FDA removed four of the original safety restrictions by \n(1) increasing the maximum gestational age at which a woman can use the \ndrug from 49 to 70 days; (2) reducing the number of required in-person office \nvisits from three to one; (3) allowing non-doctors to prescribe and administer \nthe  chemical  abortions  drugs;  and  (4) eliminating  the  requirement  for \nprescribers to report non-fatal adverse events from chemical abortion (the \n“2016 Major REMS Changes”). FDA Add. 777–802. \nIn March 2019, one of the plaintiff associations filed a second citizen \npetition challenging the 2016 Major REMS Changes (the “2019 Citizen \nPetition”). FDA Add. 192–217. That petition asked FDA to “restore” the \n2000 Approval’s REMS and “retain” a requirement that mifepristone be \ndispensed to patients in person. FDA Add. 192. \nIn April 2019, FDA approved GenBioPro, Inc’s ANDA for a generic \nversion of mifepristone (the “2019 Generic Approval”). PI App. 694–708. \nGenBioPro’s  generic  version  of  mifepristone  has  the  same  labeling  and \nREMS requirements as Danco’s Mifeprex. \nIn April 2021, FDA announced that it would “exercise enforcement \ndiscretion”  to  allow  “dispensing  mifepristone  through  the  mail . . . or \nthrough a mail-order pharmacy” during the COVID-19 pandemic (the “2021 \nMail-Order Decision”). PI App. 713–15. FDA took this action in response to \na letter from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and \nthe Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine. PI App. 710–11. \nLater that year, in December 2021, FDA denied almost all of the 2019 \nCitizen  Petition  (the  “2021  Petition  Denial”).  FDA  Add.  837–76.  In \nparticular, FDA expressly rejected the 2019 Citizen Petition’s request to \nkeep the in-person dispensing requirements and announced that the agency \n5 \n\nCase: 23-10362      Document: 00516710351     Page: 6     Date Filed: 04/12/2023\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 141   Filed 04/12/23    Page 6 of 42   PageID 4499\nNo. 23-10362 \nhad  concluded  that  “the  in-person  dispensing  requirement  is  no  longer \nnecessary.” FDA Add. 842. \nFinally,  in  January  2023,  FDA  approved  a  modified  REMS  for \nmifepristone lifting the in-person dispensing requirement. See REMS Single \nShared System for Mifepristone 200 mg (Jan. 2023), https://perma.cc/MJT5-\n35LF (the “2023 Mail-Order Decision”).2 \nC. \nIn November 2022, plaintiffs (physicians and physician organizations) \nfiled this suit against FDA, HHS, and a several agency heads in the official \ncapacities. Plaintiffs first challenged FDA’s 2000 Approval of the drug. But \nthey  also  requested  multiple  grounds  of  alternative  relief  for  FDA’s \nsubsequent  actions.  Immediately  after  filing,  plaintiffs  moved  for  a \npreliminary injunction ordering FDA to withdraw or suspend (1) FDA’s \n2000 Approval and 2019 Generic Approval, (2) FDA’s 2016 Major REMS \nChanges, and (3) FDA’s 2021 Mail-Order Decision and its 2021 Petition \nDenial of the 2019 Citizen Petition. If that’s confusing, we hope this chart \nhelps: \n   \n_____________________ \n2 Danco suggests the 2023 Mail-Order Decision moots part of plaintiffs’ claims. \nSee Danco Stay App. 22. We disagree. The Supreme Court has explicitly instructed this \ncourt to review a new agency action finalized after litigation commenced and while the \nappeal was pending because this decision was a “final agency action” for purposes of 5 \nU.S.C. § 704.

Our  power  to  grant  a  stay  is \ninherent. See In re McKenzie, 180 U.S. 536, 551 (1901); Scripps-Howard Radio \nv. FCC, 316 U.S. 4, 10–14 (1942). It’s also statutory. See Fed. R. App. P. \n8; 28 U.S.C. § 1651; 5th Cir. R. 27.3; see also 16A Charles Alan \nWright  &  Arthur  R.  Miller,  Federal  Practice  & \nProcedure § 3954 (5th ed. Apr. 2022 update).  \nBut we grant stays “only in extraordinary circumstances.” Williams v. \nZbaraz, 442 U.S. 1309, 1311 (1979) (Stevens, J., in chambers); see also Graves \nv. Barnes, 405 U.S. 1201, 1203 (1972) (Powell, J., in chambers) (same); \nRuckelshaus v. Monsanto Co., 463 U.S. 1315, 1316 (1983) (Blackmun, J., in \nchambers) (same). This rule reflects the fact that “a stay is not a matter of \nright, even if irreparable injury might otherwise result.” Virginian Ry. Co. v. \nUnited States, 272 U.S. 658, 672 (1926). Instead, a stay requires “an exercise \nof judicial discretion.” Ibid. A “decree creates a strong presumption of its \nown correctness,” which often counsels against a stay. Id. at 673. \n_____________________ \n3 As both parties recognize, this order would have the practical effect of an \ninjunction because it would remove mifepristone from the market. Plaintiffs filed a motion \nto dismiss applicants’ appeal on the theory that § 705 stays are not sufficient to trigger our \ninterlocutory appellate jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1292(a). We disagree. See Abbott v. \nPerez, 138 S. Ct. 2305, 2319–20 (2018) (explaining that the “practical effect” test of 28 \nU.S.C. §§ 1292(a)(1) and 1293 “prevents [the] manipulation” that could occur “if the \navailability of interlocutory review depended on the district court’s use of the term \n‘injunction’”). \n8 \n\nCase: 23-10362      Document: 00516710351     Page: 9     Date Filed: 04/12/2023\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 141   Filed 04/12/23    Page 9 of 42   PageID 4502\nNo. 23-10362 \nThe Supreme Court has prescribed “four traditional stay factors” \nthat govern this equitable discretion in most civil cases. Ala. Ass’n of Realtors \nv. HHS, 141 S. Ct. 2485, 2487 (2021) (quotation omitted); see also Hilton v. \nBraunskill, 481 U.S. 770, 776–77 (1987); Rose v. Raffensperger, 143 S. Ct. 58, \n59 (2022) (reversing stay of an injunction after the court of appeals failed to \nanalyze the traditional stay factors). Those factors are: \n(1) whether the stay applicant has made a strong showing that \nhe is likely to succeed on the merits; (2) whether the applicant \nwill be irreparably injured absent a stay; (3) whether issuance \nof the stay will substantially injure the other parties interested \nin the proceeding; and (4) where the public interest lies. \nNken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 426 (2009) (quoting Hilton, 481 U.S. at 776); \nsee also Whole Woman’s Health v. Jackson, 141 S. Ct. 2494, 2495 (2021). \nAlthough no factor is dispositive, the likelihood of success and irreparable \ninjury factors are “the most critical.” Nken, 556 U.S. at 434. Success on \neither  factor  requires  that  the  stay  seeker  make  a  strong  not  merely \n“possib[le]” showing. Ibid.  \nIn  these  respects,  stays  might  appear  identical  to  preliminary \ninjunctions. Similar factors govern both and both require an “extraordinary” \ndeployment of judicial discretion. Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, 555 U.S. \n7, 24 (2008). But the two are not “one and the same.” Nken, 556 U.S. at 434. \nA stay “operates upon the judicial proceeding itself,” not on the conduct of \na particular actor. Id. at 428. And, once one party has won an injunction, \nproof burdens reverse. It is the enjoined party who seeks a stay, or FDA and \nDanco here, who must carry the burden of proving that the Nken factors \ncommand us to issue one. See Landis v. N. Am. Co., 299 U.S. 248, 255 (1936). \nIf the stay applicants show that circumstances require a stay of some \nbut not all of the district court’s order, we may, in our discretion, “tailor a \nstay so that it operates with respect to only some portion of the proceeding.” \n9 \n\nCase: 23-10362      Document: 00516710351     Page: 10     Date Filed: 04/12/2023\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 141   Filed 04/12/23    Page 10 of 42   PageID 4503\nNo. 23-10362 \nTrump v. Int’l Refugee Assistance Project, 137 S. Ct. 2080, 2087 (2017) (per \ncuriam) (quoting Nken, 556 U.S. at 428).  \nWe find that FDA and Danco succeed only in part. \nIII. \n  Regarding likelihood to succeed on the merits, the stay applicants \nraise four arguments. They contend (A) plaintiffs are unlikely to defend the \ndistrict  court’s  stay  because  they  lack  standing.  They  next  contend \n(B) plaintiffs’ claims are untimely. Then they claim (C) plaintiffs’ claims are \nunexhausted.  Finally,  applicants  contend  (D)  FDA’s  actions  are  not \narbitrary, capricious, or otherwise contrary to law. We consider each in turn. \nA. \nWe begin with Article III standing. To bring their claims in federal \ncourt, plaintiffs must satisfy the familiar tripartite test: they must show they \nsuffered an injury in fact, that’s fairly traceable to the defendants, and that’s \nlikely redressable by a favorable decision. See Lujan v. Nat’l Wildlife Fed’n, \n497 U.S. 871 (1990). Importantly, only one plaintiff needs to have standing to \npresent  a  valid  case  or  controversy.  See  Rumsfeld  v.  Forum  for  Acad.  & \nInstitutional Rts., Inc., 547 U.S. 47, 52 n.2 (2006).  \nPlaintiffs and the district court offered numerous theories of standing. \nAt this preliminary, emergency stage, we are unpersuaded by applicants’ \ncontentions  that  all  of  these  theories  fail  to  create  a  justiciable  case  or \ncontroversy.  We  need  only  consider  two:  (1)  injuries  to  doctors  and \n(2) injuries to the plaintiff medical associations.4  \n_____________________ \n4 We are cognizant of the fact that the Supreme Court has disavowed the theories \nof third-party standing that previously allowed doctors to raise patients’ claims in abortion \n10 \n\nCase: 23-10362      Document: 00516710351     Page: 11     Date Filed: 04/12/2023\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 141   Filed 04/12/23    Page 11 of 42   PageID 4504\nNo. 23-10362 \n1. \nFirst, it appears that the individual plaintiffs and doctors in plaintiff \nassociations have standing to challenge FDA’s actions.  \nTo allege an injury in fact, these doctors must show they have suffered \nan “invasion of a legally protected interest” that is both “concrete and \nparticularized” and “actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical.” \nSpokeo, Inc. v. Robins, 578 U.S. 330, 339 (2016) (quotation omitted). Plaintiffs \nmust  identify  specific  injuries  that  go  beyond  “general  averments”  or \n“conclusory allegations.” Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Env’t Servs. \n(TOC), Inc., 528 U.S. 167, 184 (2000) (quoting Lujan, 497 U.S. at 888). \nWhere a plaintiff seeks prospective relief and hence points to future injuries, \nthe Supreme Court has emphasized that “threatened injury must be certainly \nimpending to constitute injury in fact, and that allegations of possible future \ninjury are not sufficient.” Clapper v. Amnesty Int’l USA, 568 U.S. 398, 409 \n(2013) (quotation omitted). \nHere, FDA-approved the “Patient Agreement Form,” which is part \nof the REMS for mifepristone, provides: \n_____________________ \ncases. See Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Org., 142 S. Ct. 2228, 2275 & n.61 (2022). So \nwe express no opinion on plaintiffs’ third-party standing theories.  \n11 \n\nCase: 23-10362      Document: 00516710351     Page: 12     Date Filed: 04/12/2023\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 141   Filed 04/12/23    Page 12 of 42   PageID 4505\nNo. 23-10362 \n \n2023  Mail-Order  Decision  at  10.  FDA  thus  cannot  deny  that  serious \ncomplications  from  mifepristone  are  certainly  impending.  Those \ncomplications are right there on the “Patient Agreement Form” that FDA \nitself approved and that Danco requires every mifepristone user to sign. \nAccording to the applicants, more than 5,000,000 women have taken this \ndrug since the 2000 Approval. FDA Stay App. 1. That means that, again \naccording to the applicants’ own information, between 100,000 (2%) and \n12 \n\nCase: 23-10362      Document: 00516710351     Page: 13     Date Filed: 04/12/2023\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 141   Filed 04/12/23    Page 13 of 42   PageID 4506\nNo. 23-10362 \n350,000 (7%) of mifepristone users had unsuccessful chemical abortions and \nhad to “talk with [their] provider[s] about a surgical procedure to end [their] \npregnanc[ies].”  2023  Mail-Order  Decision  at  10.  And  where  did  those \nhundreds of thousands of women go for their “surgical procedures”? Again, \nwe need not speculate because the 2016 Major REMS Changes, the 2021 \nPetition Denial, and the 2023 Mail-Order Decision all allow non-doctors to \nprescribe mifepristone. The women who use this drug cannot possibly go \nback to their non-doctor-prescribers for surgical abortions, so again, as the \n“Patient Agreement Form” itself says, they must instead seek “emergency \ncare” from a qualified physician. \nThe plaintiff emergency room doctors have a concrete, particularized \ninjury  since  they  have  provided—and  with  certainty  will  continue  to \nprovide—the “emergency care” that applicants specified in the “Patient \nAgreement Form.” PI App. 167, 169, 194, 206. Mifepristone users who \npresent  themselves  to  the  plaintiffs  have  required  blood  transfusions, \novernight hospitalization, intensive care, and even surgical abortions. PI App. \n205–06. As one doctor testified:  \nFor  example,  in  one  month  while  covering  the  emergency \nroom, my group practice admitted three women to the hospital. \nOf the three women admitted in one month due to chemical \nabortion  complications,  one  required  admission  to  the \nintensive care unit for sepsis and intravenous antibiotics, one \nrequired a blood transfusion for hemorrhage, and one required \nsurgical completion for the retained products of conception \n(i.e., the doctors had to surgically finish the abortion with a \nsuction aspiration procedure). \nPI App. 206.  \nAnother doctor testified: \n[O]ne  of  my  patients  had  obtained  mifepristone  and \nmisoprostol  from  a  website,  without  an  in-person \n13 \n\nCase: 23-10362      Document: 00516710351     Page: 14     Date Filed: 04/12/2023\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 141   Filed 04/12/23    Page 14 of 42   PageID 4507\nNo. 23-10362 \nvisit. . . . After taking the chemical abortion drugs, she began \nhaving very heavy bleeding followed by significant abdominal \npain and a fever. When I saw her in the emergency room, she \nhad  evidence  of  retained  pregnancy  tissue  along  with \nendometritis, an infection of the uterine lining. She also had \nacute kidney injury, with elevate creatinine. She required a \ndilation and curettage (D&C) surgery to finish evacuating her \nuterus of the remaining pregnancy tissue and hospitalization \nfor  intravenous  (IV)  antibiotics,  IV  hydration,  and  a  blood \ntransfusion.  I  spent  several  hours  with  her  the  day  of  her \nsurgery/hospital  admission,  keeping  me  from  my  primary \npatient  responsibilities  in  the  labor  and  delivery  unit  and \nrequiring me to call in an additional physician to help cover \nthose responsibilities. \nPI App. 194–95. As a result of FDA’s failure to regulate this potent drug, \nthese doctors have had to devote significant time and resources to caring for \nwomen experiencing mifepristone’s harmful effects. This harm is sufficiently \nconcrete. \nA second independent injury from the adverse effects of mifepristone \nis the “enormous stress and pressure” physicians face in treating these \nwomen.  PI  App.  215.  One  doctor  said  the  strain  “is  some  of  the  most \nemotionally taxing work I have done in my career.” PI App. 880. Thus, this \nis an independent injury because FDA’s actions “significantly affect[]” the \ndoctors’ “quality of life.” Sierra Club v. Morton, 405 U.S. 727, 734–35 (1972).  \nThe doctors offered specific facts to explain this stress. Women who \ntake these drugs are susceptible to “torrential bleeding.” PI App. 170, 215. In \nfact, “the risk of severe bleeding with chemical abortion is five times higher \nthan from surgical abortion.” PI App. 879. And these situations can quickly \ngo from bad to worse. As one doctor testified:  \nOne of my patients, who was about nine weeks pregnant, had \npreviously  been  treated  by  hospital  staff  for  a  pulmonary \n14 \n\nCase: 23-10362      Document: 00516710351     Page: 15     Date Filed: 04/12/2023\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 141   Filed 04/12/23    Page 15 of 42   PageID 4508\nNo. 23-10362 \nembolism with anti-coagulants. She was advised that she could \nnot seek a chemical abortion because it was contraindicated \ndue to the medications; yet the woman left the hospital and \nsought an abortion at Planned Parenthood of Indiana. The \nwoman  was  given  mifepristone  by  the  doctor  at  Planned \nParenthood and took the drug. The woman called an Uber for \na ride home from Planned Parenthood. The woman began to \nexperience  bleeding  and  other  adverse  effects  from  the \nmifepristone. The woman’s Uber driver did not take her home \nbecause she was so ill and instead brought her to the hospital’s \nemergency  department.  At  the  hospital,  the  woman  came \nunder my care. The  woman had  not yet taken the second \nabortion drug, misoprostol. I treated the patient for the adverse \neffects she suffered and told her not to take the misoprostol \ngiven to her by Planned Parenthood because of the grave risk \nthat she could bleed out and die.  \nPI App. 216–17. Another doctor recounted an experience where he treated a \npatient—who “suffered from two weeks of moderate to heavy bleeding, and \nthen developed a uterine infection”—by providing her “with intravenous \nantibiotics” and performing a D&C procedure. PI App. 886. If the patient \nwaited a few more days to go to the hospital, the doctor predicted that “she \ncould have been septic and died.” PI App. 886. Another doctor testified that \nhe has encountered “at least a dozen cases of life-threatening complications” \nfrom these drugs, and the frequency of these emergency situations has only \nincreased over time. PI App. 865. \nThe  risks  are  only  exacerbated  for  women  who  have  ectopic \npregnancies. PI App.  207. This occurs in approximately two percent of \npregnancies. PI App. 539. As one doctor explained:  \nChemical abortion drugs will not effectually end an ectopic \npregnancy because they exert their effects on the uterus, which \nleaves women at risk of severe harm from hemorrhage due to \ntubal rupture, in need of emergent surgery or potentially at risk \n15 \n\nCase: 23-10362      Document: 00516710351     Page: 16     Date Filed: 04/12/2023\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 141   Filed 04/12/23    Page 16 of 42   PageID 4509\nNo. 23-10362 \nof death. Failure to perform an ultrasound prior to prescribing \nabortion drugs will cause some women to remain undiagnosed \nand at high risk for these adverse outcomes.  \nPI App. 208. The risks are greater under FDA’s relaxed standards. That is \nbecause “without an in-person examination, it is impossible to rule out an \nectopic pregnancy,” placing a woman “at an increased risk of rupture or even \ndeath.” PI App. 886. \nThe doctors also face an injury from the irreconcilable choice between \nperforming  their  jobs  and  abiding  by  their  consciences.  These  doctors \nstructured their careers so they would not have to administer abortions. And \nyet,  because  women  often  come  to  hospitals  when  they  experience \ncomplications from these drugs, these doctors sometimes have no other \nchoice but to perform surgical abortions. As one doctor testified:  \nThe FDA’s expansion of chemical abortions also harms my \nconscience rights because it could force me to have to surgically \nfinish an incomplete elective chemical abortion. I object to \nabortion because it ends a human life. My moral and ethical \nobligation to my patients is to promote human life and health. \nBut the FDA’s actions may force me to end the life of a human \nbeing in the womb for no medical reason.  \nPI App. 209–10. And this harm is not speculative. Several doctors confirmed \nthat they have had to surgically complete an abortion or remove an unborn \nchild. PI App. 886, 205. As one doctor testified: “In my practice, I have cared \nfor at least a dozen women who have required surgery to remove retained \npregnancy tissue after a chemical abortion. Sometimes this includes the \nembryo or fetus, and sometimes it is placental tissue that has not been \ncompletely expelled.” PI App. 205. That same doctor described how she had \nto “perform[] a suction aspiration procedure” on one patient who took the \npill but needed surgery to complete the abortion. PI App. 206. Others have \nseen it firsthand. One doctor recounted a time where a woman came to the \n16 \n\nCase: 23-10362      Document: 00516710351     Page: 17     Date Filed: 04/12/2023\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 141   Filed 04/12/23    Page 17 of 42   PageID 4510\nNo. 23-10362 \nemergency room “with heavy vaginal bleeding and unstable vital signs as a \nresult of taking chemical abortion drugs.” PI App. 195. When the woman \narrived in the emergency room, the baby in her womb was not dead; the \ndoctors were “able to detect a fetal heartbeat.” PI App. 195. But due to the \nmother’s unstable condition, the doctors “had no choice but to perform an \nemergency D&C.” PI App. 196. The doctor testified that her colleague “felt \nas though she was forced to participate in something that she did not want to \nbe a part of—completing the abortion.” PI App. 196. \nAnd not only have these doctors suffered injuries in the past, but it’s \nalso inevitable that at least one doctor in one of these associations will face a \nharm in the future. Cf. City of Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95 (1983). Here, \nthe plaintiff-doctors have “‘set forth’ by affidavit or other evidence ‘specific \nfacts’” that they are certain to see more patients. Clapper, 568 U.S. at 411 \n(quoting Lujan v. Defs. of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 561 (1992)). That’s because \nFDA has removed almost all of mifepristone’s REMS and thus enabled \nwomen to (1) get the drug without ever talking to a physician, (2) take the \ndrug without ever having a physical exam to ensure gestational age and/or an \nectopic  pregnancy,  and  (3)  attempt  to  complete  the  chemical  abortion \nregimen at home; FDA has also (4) directed the hundreds of thousands of \nwomen who have complications to seek “emergency care” from the plaintiffs \nand plaintiffs’ hospitals. Several doctors testified that they have seen an \nincreasing  number  of  women  coming  to  the  emergency  room  with \ncomplications from chemical abortions due to FDA’s virtual elimination of \ncontrols on the dispensing and administration of the drugs. PI App. 194, 205, \n215, 866. And given how many women these doctors have seen in emergency \ndepartments in the past, these doctors quite reasonably know with statistical \ncertainty—again,  a  statistic  estimated  on  Mifeprex’s  own  “Patient \nAgreement  Form”—that  women  will  continue  needing  plaintiffs’ \n“emergency care.” See PI App. 205, 215, 868. The crisis is “concededly \n17 \n\nCase: 23-10362      Document: 00516710351     Page: 18     Date Filed: 04/12/2023\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 141   Filed 04/12/23    Page 18 of 42   PageID 4511\nNo. 23-10362 \nongoing.” Friends of the Earth, 528 U.S. at 184. Accordingly, plaintiffs face a \n“substantial risk” of recurrence. Susan B. Anthony List v. Driehaus, 573 U.S. \n149, 158 (2014) (quotation omitted).  \nAnd even if one of the named doctors never sees another patient, it’s \ninevitable that one of the thousands of doctors in plaintiff associations will. \nFor example, one of the plaintiff associations, the American Association of \nPro-Life Obstetricians & Gynecologists, “is the largest organization of pro-\nlife obstetricians and gynecologists” and has “more than 7,000 medical \nprofessionals nationwide.” PI App. 165. The Christian Medical and Dental \nAssociation  has  “more  than  600  physicians  and  approximately  35 \nOBGYNs.”  PI  App.  179.  The  American  College  of  Pediatricians  has  a \nmembership  of  “more  than  600  physicians  and  other  healthcare \nprofessionals.” PI App. 187. These associations presented affidavits from \nindividual members, elucidating the various harms discussed herein. See \nFriends  of  the  Earth,  528  U.S.  at  183–84.  Thus,  they  have  associational \nstanding to sue on behalf of their members. See N.Y. State Club Ass’n, Inc. v. \nCity of New York, 487 U.S. 1, 9 (1988); Hunt v. Wash. State Apple Advertising \nComm’n, 432 U.S. 333, 343 (1977). That means that so long as one doctor \namong  the  thousands  of  members  in  these  associations  faces  an  injury, \nArticle III is satisfied. See Rumsfeld, 547 U.S. at 52 n.2. \nThe doctors can also show that these injuries are traceable to FDA \nregulations and redressable by this court. See Defs. of Wildlife, 504 U.S. at \n560–61. That’s because the 2016 Major REMS Changes, the 2021 Petition \nDenial,  and  the  2023  Mail-Order  Decision  all  empower  non-doctors  to \nprescribe mifepristone and thus shift the costs of the drug onto the plaintiff \nphysicians who must manage the aftermath. See, e.g., PI App. 218 (“I spent a \nsignificant amount of time that day working to save her life from unnecessary \ncomplications due to the irresponsible administration and use of mifepristone \nand misoprostol. As a result of the significant time that I devoted to that \n18 \n\nCase: 23-10362      Document: 00516710351     Page: 19     Date Filed: 04/12/2023\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 141   Filed 04/12/23    Page 19 of 42   PageID 4512\nNo. 23-10362 \npatient, my time and attention was taken away from other patients, who also \nneed  my  care.”);  PI  App.  867  (“Because  more  women  [who  take \nmifepristone] are unnecessarily presenting in the emergency department, \nmore of my time and attention is taken away from other patients who need \nit.”). In this way, “[t]he FDA’s actions have created a culture of chaos for \nemergency room physicians.” PI App. 867. And we’re capable of redressing \nplaintiffs’ injuries by restoring the 2000 Approval’s REMS. Accordingly, at \nthis stage, applicants have not shown that all of the plaintiffs lack standing. \nWe hasten to emphasize the narrowness of this holding. We do not \nhold that doctors necessarily have standing to raise their patients’ claims. See \nsupra n.4. We do not hold that doctors have constitutional standing whenever \nthey’re called upon to do their jobs. And we do not hold that doctors have \nstanding to challenge FDA’s actions whenever the doctor sees a patient \nexperiencing complications from an FDA-approved drug. Rather, we hold \nthat on the record before us applicants know that hundreds of thousands of \nwomen will—with applicants’ own statistical certainty—need emergency \ncare on account of applicants’ actions. And because applicants chose to cut \nout  doctors  from  the  prescription  and  administration  of  mifepristone, \nplaintiff doctors and their associations will necessarily be injured by the \nconsequences. This is an exceedingly unusual regime. In fact, as far as the \nrecord before us reveals, FDA has not structured the distribution of any \ncomparable drug in this way. \n  FDA’s principal contention to the contrary is that mifepristone is \ncomparable to “ibuprofen.” FDA Stay App. 1. The theory appears to be that \nwe cannot recognize plaintiffs’ standing here without opening a pandora’s \nbox  in  which  doctors  have  standing  to  litigate  everything  at  all  times, \nincluding the banalities of over-the-counter Advil.  \n19 \n\nCase: 23-10362      Document: 00516710351     Page: 20     Date Filed: 04/12/2023\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 141   Filed 04/12/23    Page 20 of 42   PageID 4513\nNo. 23-10362 \n  We disagree because FDA’s own documents show that mifepristone \nbears no resemblance to ibuprofen. In the 2000 Approval, FDA imposed a \n“Black Box” warning on mifepristone. FDA requires “Black Box” warnings \nwhen a drug “may lead to death or serious injury.” 21 C.F.R. § 201.57(c)(1). \nIn its 2000 Approval, FDA conditioned its approval of mifepristone on the \ninclusion of this “Black Box” warning: \n \nFDA  Add.  182.  The  2016  Major  REMS  Changes  relaxed  many  of  the \nrequirements  for  marketing  and  using  mifepristone.  But  it  retained  this \n“Black Box” warning: \n20 \n\nCase: 23-10362      Document: 00516710351     Page: 21     Date Filed: 04/12/2023\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 141   Filed 04/12/23    Page 21 of 42   PageID 4514\nNo. 23-10362 \n \nhttps://perma.cc/R56J-BHW4. \nIbuprofen’s  label,  which  FDA  helpfully  provided  in  its  stay \naddendum, obviously bears no resemblance to the “Black Box” warning on \nmifepristone’s label. FDA Add. 465–68. To the contrary, FDA has a special \nregulation regarding ibuprofen so all manufacturers of that over-the-counter \nmedicine  include  the  same  information  on  their  labels.  See  21  C.F.R. \n§ 201.326. It says nothing about REMS, surgery, emergencies, Emergency \nRooms, or death. \nIn sum, applicants’ own documents—from the “Patient Agreement \nForm” to the “Black Box” warning that have accompanied mifepristone \n21 \n\nCase: 23-10362      Document: 00516710351     Page: 22     Date Filed: 04/12/2023\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 141   Filed 04/12/23    Page 22 of 42   PageID 4515\nNo. 23-10362 \never  since  the  2000  Approval  up  to  and  including  today—prove  that \nemergency room care is statistically certain in hundreds of thousands of \ncases. Plaintiff doctors have provided that emergency room care and are \nstatistically certain to provide it in the future. \n2. \nSecond, the associations have standing. As previously discussed, they \nhave associational standing to sue on behalf of their members. See N.Y. State \nClub Ass’n, Inc., 487 U.S. at 9; Hunt, 432 U.S. at 343. The associations \npresented  affidavits  from  individual  member  doctors  who  have  suffered \nharms. See Friends of the Earth, 528 U.S. at 183–84. Accordingly, they have \nstanding to sue on their members’ behalf.  \nPlaintiff associations have also suffered independent injuries because \nFDA’s actions have frustrated their organizational efforts to educate their \nmembers and the public on the effects of mifepristone. See Havens Realty \nCorp. v. Coleman, 455 U.S. 363, 379 (1982) (holding that housing non-profit \nhad standing to challenge racial steering practices that impaired its ability “to \nprovide  counseling  and  referral  services  for  low-and-moderate-income \nhomeseekers”). As a  result, plaintiff associations have expended  “time, \nenergy,  and  resources  to  compensate  for  this  lack  of  information  by \nconducting  their  own  studies  and  analyses  of  available  data”  to  “the \ndetriment of other advocacy and educational efforts.” PI App. 174. The \nSupreme  Court  has  previously  stated  that  such  a  “concrete  and \ndemonstrable injury to the organization’s activities—with the consequent \ndrain on the organization’s resources—constitutes far more than simply a \nsetback to the organization’s abstract social interests,” Havens, 455 U.S. at \n379, even where the organizational interest is purely “noneconomic,” id. at \n379 n.20. Rather, under these circumstances, “there can be no question that \nthe organization has suffered an injury in fact.” Id. at 379.  \n22 \n\nCase: 23-10362      Document: 00516710351     Page: 23     Date Filed: 04/12/2023\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 141   Filed 04/12/23    Page 23 of 42   PageID 4516\nNo. 23-10362 \nThis injury is also traceable to FDA’s elimination of non-fatal adverse \nevents in the 2016 Major REMS Changes. And it’s redressable by an order \nvacating those changes. Accordingly, these associations also have standing. \nB. \n  Next we turn to timeliness.  \n  Everyone  acknowledges  that  28  U.S.C.  §  2401(a)’s  six-year \nlimitations  period  applies  to  all  of  this  case’s  challenged  actions.  And \nplaintiffs’ right of action against the lion’s share of the challenged actions are \nsquarely  within  the  six-year  window.  That  includes  all  of  plaintiffs’ \nalternative arguments challenging the 2016 Major REMS Changes, the 2019 \nGeneric Approval, the 2021 Mail-Order Decision, and the 2021 Petition \nDenial of the 2019 Citizen Petition.  \n  True, FDA’s March 2016 Major REMS Changes were promulgated \nmore than six years before plaintiffs filed suit in November 2022. But Section \n2401(a) instructs that the six-year period begins when “the right of action \nfirst accrues.” “And ‘[t]he right of action first accrues on the date of the final \nagency action.’” Texas v. Biden, 20 F.4th 928, 951 n.3 (5th Cir. 2021), rev’d \non other grounds, 142 S. Ct. 2528 (2022) (quoting Wash. All. of Tech. Workers \nv. DHS, 892 F.3d 332, 342 (D.C. Cir. 2018)). Though FDA promulgated the \nMajor REMS Changes in 2016, the Agency didn’t respond to plaintiffs’ 2019 \nPetition challenging those changes until December 16, 2021. So plaintiffs’ \nright of action against FDA’s final decision first accrued in December of \n2021. See 21 C.F.R. § 10.45. That’s less than a year before plaintiffs sued, \nwhich is well within the limitations period.  \n  Next, applicants claim that plaintiffs’ primary challenges to the 2000 \nApproval and FDA’s 2016 Petition Denial to their 2002 Citizen Petition are \ntime-barred. Though admittedly a close question, we ultimately agree with \napplicants at this preliminary juncture.  \n23 \n\nCase: 23-10362      Document: 00516710351     Page: 24     Date Filed: 04/12/2023\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 141   Filed 04/12/23    Page 24 of 42   PageID 4517\nNo. 23-10362 \n  Plaintiffs’ right of action against the 2000 Approval and 2016 Petition \nDenial first accrued on March 29, 2016—the date FDA issued its final \ndecision rejecting their 2002 Petition challenging the 2000 Approval. See 21 \nC.F.R. § 10.45. But plaintiffs didn’t file suit until November 18, 2022, more \nthan  six  months  beyond  the  statute  of  limitations.  The  district  court \nnevertheless found timely the plaintiffs’ challenges to the 2000 Approval and \nthe  2016  Petition  Denial.  How?  First,  the district  court  held  that  FDA \n“reopened” those decisions in 2016 and 2021, thus restarting the statute of \nlimitations. Second—and alternatively—the district court decided plaintiffs \nwere entitled to equitable tolling.  \n  We consider each justification in turn. \n  First,  reopening.  “The  reopen[ing]  doctrine  allows  an  otherwise \nuntimely challenge to proceed where an agency has—either explicitly or \nimplicitly—undertaken to reexamine its former choice.” Nat’l Biodiesel Bd. \nv. EPA, 843 F.3d 1010, 1017 (D.C. Cir. 2016) (quotation omitted). Put simply, \nthe purpose of the reopening doctrine is “to pinpoint an agency’s final action \nin cases where the agency has addressed the same issue multiple times.” \nTexas v. Biden, 20 F.4th at 951. The limitations period runs from the agency’s \nearlier decision unless the later decision “opened the issue up anew.” Ibid. \n(quotation omitted).  This makes good sense: Because a key step in the \ntimeliness inquiry is determining when an agency action became final, it’s \nsometimes necessary to determine whether an agency’s subsequent action \n“actually reconsidered” its former action, Growth Energy v. EPA, 5 F.4th 1, \n21  (D.C.  Cir.  2021)  (per  curiam)  (quotation  omitted),  or  merely \n“reaffirm[ed] its prior position,” Sierra Club v. EPA, 551 F.3d 1019, 1024 \n(D.C. Cir. 2008) (quotation omitted); see also Texas v. Biden, 20 F.4th at 951 \n(“If  the  agency  opened  the  issue  up  anew,  and  then  reexamined  and \nreaffirmed its prior decision, the agency’s second action (the reaffirmance) \nis reviewable. . . . But if the agency merely reaffirmed its decision without \n24 \n\nCase: 23-10362      Document: 00516710351     Page: 25     Date Filed: 04/12/2023\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 141   Filed 04/12/23    Page 25 of 42   PageID 4518\nNo. 23-10362 \nreally opening the decision back up and reconsidering it, the agency’s initial \naction is the only final agency action to review.” (quotation omitted)). \n  Courts  have  articulated  various  tests  for  determining  whether  an \nagency  has  reopened  a  prior  decision.  These  tests  fall  into  two  general \ncategories. \n  Under the first, courts look “to the entire context of the [relevant \nagency action] including all relevant proposals and reactions of the agency to \ndetermine whether an issue was in fact reopened.” Pub. Citizen v. Nuclear \nRegul. Comm’n, 901 F.2d 147, 150 (D.C. Cir. 1990); see also, e.g., id. at 150–\n53; Growth Energy, 5 F.4th at 21–22; Nat’l Ass’n of Reversionary Prop. Owners \nv. Surface Transp. Bd., 158 F.3d 135, 141–46 (D.C. Cir. 1998). An agency can \nreopen an earlier decision in many ways, but the quintessential example of \nthis type of reopening is when an agency “hold[s] out [its prior rule] as a \nproposed  regulation,  offer[s]  an  explanation  for  its  language,  solicit[s] \ncomments on its substance, and respond[s] to the comments in promulgating \nthe regulation in its final form.” Am. Iron & Steel Inst. v. EPA, 886 F.2d 390, \n397 (D.C. Cir. 1989). Under the second reopening category, courts consider \nwhether an agency “constructively reopened” its prior decision. Kennecott \nUtah Copper Corp. v. DOI, 88 F.3d 1191, 1214–15 (D.C. Cir. 1996). They do \nso  by  evaluating  whether  “the  revision  of  accompanying  regulations \nsignificantly alters the stakes of judicial review as the result of a change that \ncould have not been reasonably anticipated.” NRDC v. EPA, 571 F.3d 1245, \n1266 (D.C. Cir. 2009) (quotation omitted). \n  Although a close call, we are unsure at this preliminary juncture and \nafter truncated review that FDA reopened the 2000 Approval in its 2016 \nMajor REMS Changes and its 2021 Petition Denial.  \n  As for the first reopening test, neither the 2016 Major REMS Changes \nnor  the  2021  Petition  Denial  appears  to  “substantive[ly]  reconsider[]” \n25 \n\nCase: 23-10362      Document: 00516710351     Page: 26     Date Filed: 04/12/2023\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 141   Filed 04/12/23    Page 26 of 42   PageID 4519\nNo. 23-10362 \nFDA’s 2000 Approval. Growth Energy, 5 F.4th at 21. FDA’s 2016 decision to \nrelax many of the REMS was issued in response to Danco’s supplemental \napplication  requesting  as  much.  See  PI  App.  615–52.  And  FDA’s  2021 \nPetition Denial was issued in response to plaintiffs’ 2019 Citizen Petition \nasking FDA to “restore” the pre-2016 REMS—not revoke or reconsider \nFDA’s underlying 2000 Approval. See PI App. 667–93. Therefore neither of \nthe “relevant proposals” prompted FDA to reopen and reconsider its 2000 \nApproval. Pub. Citizen, 901 F.2d at 150. \n  That said, the district court correctly noted that FDA nevertheless \n“undertook a full review of the Mifepristone REMS Program” when it \nreviewed plaintiffs’ 2019 Citizen Petition—even though the plaintiffs only \nasked FDA to restore the pre-2016 status quo ante. See PI App. 735–76; FDA \nAdd. 22. In FDA’s words: \nIn 2021, FDA also undertook a full review of the Mifepristone \nREMS Program. In conducting this review, FDA reviewed \nmultiple different sources of information, including published \nliterature, safety information submitted to the Agency during \nthe COVID-19 PHE, FDA Adverse Event Reporting System \n(FAERS) reports, the first REMS assessment report for the \nMifepristone REMS Program, and information provided by \nadvocacy  groups,  individuals,  and  the  Plaintiffs  in  ongoing \nlitigation, as well as information submitted by the sponsors of \nthe NDA and the ANDA[.] \nPI App. 735. And after conducting this unrequested “full review” of the \nREMS Program, FDA (inter alia) added two modifications to the REMS \nProgram that plaintiffs never even mentioned in their 2019 Citizen Petition, \nincluding “a requirement that pharmacies that dispense the drug be specially \ncertified.” PI App. 736; see also id. at 735 n.11 (acknowledging that “this was \nnot raised in your Petition”). All of this suggests FDA went back to the \nbeginning,  including  its  very  first  REMS  report,  and  conducted  an \n26 \n\nCase: 23-10362      Document: 00516710351     Page: 27     Date Filed: 04/12/2023\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 141   Filed 04/12/23    Page 27 of 42   PageID 4520\nNo. 23-10362 \nindependent review that far exceeded the issues raised in the 2019 Citizen \nPetition. \n  Especially because the dangerousness of a drug is grounds to withdraw \nits approval, see 21 U.S.C. § 355(e)—and REMS are required to “ensure that \nthe benefits of the drug outweigh the risks,” id. § 355-1(a)(1)–(2)—plaintiffs \nreasonably  argue  that  FDA’s  2021  “full  review”  of  the  entire  REMS \nProgram was in effect a reconsideration of FDA’s 2000 Approval. Indeed, \nplaintiffs might very well prevail on that claim later in this litigation. But at \nthis early juncture—and in light of our necessarily truncated review—we are \nnot yet confident enough to say that viewed in “the entire context,” FDA \n“has  undertaken  a  serious,  substantive  reconsideration  of  the  [2000 \nApproval]” rather than “incremental adjustments to existing regulations.” \nTexas v. Biden, 20 F.4th at 952–93 (quotation omitted). \n  The result is the same under the second reopening test. Recall that \nunder the second test, “[a] constructive reopening occurs if the revision of \naccompanying regulations significantly alters the stakes of judicial review as \nthe result of a change that could have not been reasonably anticipated.” \nSierra Club, 551 F.3d at 1025 (quotation omitted). \n  Sierra Club is the seminal case. In 1994, EPA adopted a rule that \nexempted major sources of air pollution from the Clean Air Act’s emission \nstandards  during  startups,  shutdowns,  and  malfunctions  (the  “SSM \nexemption”). Id. at 1022. But the 1994 rule also required sources to develop \nan SSM plan in order to receive the benefit of the SSM exemption. Ibid. An \nSSM plan required “the source to demonstrate how it will do its reasonable \nbest to maintain compliance with the standards, even during SSMs.” Ibid. \n(quotation  omitted).  SSM  plans  were  publicly  available  and  were \nincorporated into the sources’ permits under Title V of the Clean Air Act. \nIbid. \n27 \n\nCase: 23-10362      Document: 00516710351     Page: 28     Date Filed: 04/12/2023\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 141   Filed 04/12/23    Page 28 of 42   PageID 4521\nNo. 23-10362 \n  In a series of rulemakings between 2002 and 2006, EPA substantially \nweakened the requirement that sources maintain and follow an SSM plan in \norder to benefit from the SSM exemption. It removed the requirement that a \nsource’s Title V permit incorporate its SSM plan; it stopped making SSM \nplans publicly available; and it ultimately retracted the requirement that \nsources implement their SSM plans during SSM periods. Id. at 1023. \n  The  Sierra  Club  filed  suit  in  2007.  But  the  Sierra  Club  did  not \nchallenge the changes to the SSM plan requirements that EPA had adopted \nin its 2002, 2003, and 2006 rulemakings. Instead, it challenged the legality of \nthe SSM exemption itself. Id. at 1024. EPA had adopted that exception in \n1994 and had not considered rescinding it in any of its rulemakings during the \n2000s.  Rather,  those  rulemakings  had  treated  the  SSM  exemption  as  a \ngiven—in  fact,  they  had  strengthened  it  by  weakening  the  SSM  plan \nrequirements. See id. at 1022–23. \n  The D.C. Circuit nonetheless held that the Sierra Club’s challenge to \nthe  SSM  exemption  was  timely.  Even  though  EPA  had  not  expressly \nreopened its decision  to create a SSM  exemption, it had constructively \nreopened  that  decision  “by  stripping  out  virtually  all  of  the  SSM  plan \nrequirements  that  it  created  to  contain  that  exemption.”  Id.  at  1025 \n(quotation omitted). Because EPA had allegedly abandoned these “necessary \nsafeguards” limiting the SSM exemption, its rulemakings had “changed the \ncalculus for petitioners in seeking judicial review and thereby constructively \nreopened  consideration  of  the  exemption.”  Id.  at  1025–26  (quotation \nomitted). \n  Sierra Club thus establishes that an agency can constructively reopen \na decision if it removes essential safeguards that had previously limited or \ncontained the impact of that decision. In making this determination, the D.C. \nCircuit looks to the extent to which the agency has “alter[ed] th[e] regulatory \n28 \n\nCase: 23-10362      Document: 00516710351     Page: 29     Date Filed: 04/12/2023\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 141   Filed 04/12/23    Page 29 of 42   PageID 4522\nNo. 23-10362 \nframework” and whether the agency has “work[ed] a change that [plaintiffs] \ncould not have reasonably anticipated.” Nat’l Biodiesel Bd., 843 F.3d at 1017.   \n  Under  Sierra  Club  and  its  progeny,  FDA’s  2016  Major  REMS \nChanges and 2021 Petition Denial seemingly reopened its 2000 Approval \ndecision.  Of  course,  FDA  did  not  expressly  reconsider  its  mifepristone \napproval. But it eliminated the “necessary safeguards,” Sierra Club, 551 F.3d \nat 1025, that had accompanied and limited the impact of that approval for two \ndecades. The in-person dispensing requirement, for example, was critical to \nFDA’s initial approval of mifepristone in 2000, which relied on the in-person \ndispensing requirement to dismiss concerns about provider qualifications, \nimproper use, illicit distribution, and detection of adverse events. See PI App. \n519–23. And the in-person dispensing requirement was also the cornerstone \nof the REMS for mifepristone that FDA approved in 2011 and then relied on \nin its 2016 rejection of plaintiffs’ 2002 Citizen Petition. See PI App. 578–82, \n605, 608.   \n  Thus FDA’s elimination of the in-person distribution requirement—\nnot to mention various other REMS—arguably worked a “sea change” in the \nlegal framework governing mifepristone distribution that plaintiffs “could \nnot have reasonably anticipated” and that “significantly alters the stakes of \njudicial review.” Nat’l Biodiesel Bd., 843 F.3d at 1017 (quotation omitted). \nThat’s because the in-person dispensing requirement was FDA’s primary \ntool for ensuring the safe distribution and use of mifepristone, so plaintiffs \narguably had little reason to anticipate this important change before 2021. \nFDA  does  not  argue  otherwise,  appearing  to  concede  that  its  2021 \nannouncement was a stark departure from previous regulatory approaches. \nAnd because this change eliminates a major safeguard against complications \nand adverse effects arising from improper mifepristone use, it can be said to \n“significantly alter[] the stakes of judicial review” for plaintiff doctors who \ntreat patients with these complications. Ibid. (quotation omitted). \n29 \n\nCase: 23-10362      Document: 00516710351     Page: 30     Date Filed: 04/12/2023\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 141   Filed 04/12/23    Page 30 of 42   PageID 4523\nNo. 23-10362 \n  Even so, we ultimately hold at this early and emergency stage that \nthese alterations didn’t constructively reopen the 2000 Approval for review. \nThat’s because there’s at least a colorable argument that plaintiffs “could \nhave . . . reasonably anticipated” changes like those in 2016 and 2021 by dint \nof the statutorily defined supplemental application process and other similar \nrevision mechanisms. NRDC v. EPA, 571 F.3d at 1266 (quotation omitted); \nsee, e.g., 21 C.F.R. § 314.71(b). We also recognize that it’s somewhat of a \nstrain to say that the 2016 Major REMS Changes and 2021 Petition Denial \n(and related changes) altered the regulatory landscape to such a degree that \nthe prior rule is only now “worth challenging” when it otherwise might “not \nhave been.” Sierra Club, 551 F.3d at 1025–26 (quotation omitted). After all, \nplaintiffs did challenge the 2000 Approval well before the 2016 and 2021 \nchanges were even proposed. But again, plaintiffs could very well prevail on \nthis reopening claim. \n  In the alternative, the district court held that plaintiffs were entitled \nto equitable tolling of the statute of limitations. FDA Add. 23–25. We are \nunpersuaded. “[A] litigant is entitled to equitable tolling of a statute of \nlimitations only if the litigant establishes two elements: ‘(1) that he has been \npursuing his rights diligently, and (2) that some extraordinary circumstance \nstood in his way and prevented timely filing.’” Menominee Indian Tribe of Wis. \nv. United States, 577 U.S. 250, 255 (2016) (quoting Holland v. Florida, 560 \nU.S. 631, 649 (2010)). Here, no “extraordinary circumstance” prevented \nplaintiffs from filing within six years of FDA’s 2016 Petition Denial. The \ndistrict court is of course correct that FDA took “13 years, 7 months, and 9 \ndays” to render that March 2016 ruling, FDA Add. 24, but that delay had no \nimpact on the length of the statute-of-limitations period or plaintiffs’ capacity \nto challenge the 2016 Petition Denial.   \n30 \n\nCase: 23-10362      Document: 00516710351     Page: 31     Date Filed: 04/12/2023\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 141   Filed 04/12/23    Page 31 of 42   PageID 4524\nNo. 23-10362 \nC. \nNext exhaustion. Stay applicants contend they are likely to succeed on \nthe merits because plaintiffs failed to exhaust their claims before FDA. We \ndisagree.  \n“As a general rule, claims not presented to the agency may not be \nmade for the first time to a reviewing court.” Wash. Ass’n for Television & \nChild. v. FCC, 712 F.2d 677, 680 (D.C. Cir. 1983); cf. United States v. L.A. \nTucker Truck Lines, 344 U.S. 33, 37 (1952). For challenges to FDA actions, \nthe general administrative exhaustion requirement is codified at 21 C.F.R. \n§ 10.45(b).  Section  10.45(b)  states  that  a  “request  that  the  [FDA] \nCommissioner take or refrain from taking any form of administrative action \nmust first be the subject of a final administrative decision based on a petition \nsubmitted under § 10.25(a).” See id. § 10.25(a) (“An interested person may \npetition the [FDA] Commissioner to issue, amend, or revoke a regulation or \norder, or to take or refrain from taking any other form of administrative \naction.”). \nNo one disputes that every argument the plaintiffs raised in their 2019 \nCitizen Petition is exhausted. That includes all of plaintiffs’ challenges to the \n2016  Major  REMS  Changes  and  everything  fairly  embraced  by  those \nchallenges. For example, the 2019 Citizen Petition argued explicitly that \nFDA should “[c]ontinue limiting the dispensing of Mifeprex to patients in \nclinics, medical offices, and hospitals.” FDA Add. 193, 209–16. When FDA \nrejected that request in the 2021 Petition Denial, it expressly reaffirmed its \ncommitment to mail-order abortion drugs. As such, plaintiffs have properly \nexhausted their challenge to FDA’s by-mail distribution regime by raising it \nin the 2019 Citizen Petition. \nEven  if  plaintiffs  failed  to  exhaust  their  claims,  courts  retain \n“discretion  to  waive  exhaustion”  where  one  of  the  “traditionally \n31 \n\nCase: 23-10362      Document: 00516710351     Page: 32     Date Filed: 04/12/2023\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 141   Filed 04/12/23    Page 32 of 42   PageID 4525\nNo. 23-10362 \nrecognized” exceptions applies. Wash. Ass’n for Television & Child., 712 F.2d \nat 681–82. Two exceptions are relevant here: futility and administrative abuse \nof process. \nStart with futility. Plaintiffs need not exhaust claims where they can \ndemonstrate “the futility or inadequacy of administrative review.” Gardner \nv. Sch. Bd. Caddo. Par., 958 F.2d 108, 112 (5th Cir. 1992); see also Honig v. \nDoe,  484  U.S.  305,  327  (1988).  The  futility  exception  applies  when \nexhaustion would be “clearly useless” and “it is certain [a] claim will be \ndenied.” Tesoro Refin. & Mktg. Co. v. FERC, 552 F.3d 868, 874 (D.C. Cir. \n2009) (quotation omitted); see also Carr v. Saul, 141 S. Ct. 1352, 1361 (2021) \n(“[T]his Court has consistently recognized a futility exception to exhaustion \nrequirements.”).  \nGiven FDA’s 2016 Petition Denial and its 2021 Petition Denial, it \nwould have been futile for plaintiffs to include a challenge to the 2000 \nApproval in their 2019 Citizen Petition. FDA rejected this exact challenge in \nits 2016 Petition Denial. So it would have been “clearly useless” to raise the \nprecise challenge again in the 2019 Citizen Petition. Further, this exact \nreasoning applies with equal force to plaintiffs’ challenge to the 2019 Generic \nApproval because it’s entirely dependent on the underlying 2000 Approval. \nThus, plaintiffs’ challenges to the 2000 Approval and the 2019 Generic \nApproval are not barred by exhaustion. \n  Next, administrative abuse of process. It’s well-established that where \nan agency fails to follow its own regulations, exhaustion may not be required. \nSee Way of Life Television Network, Inc. v. FCC, 593 F.2d 1356, 1359–60 (D.C. \nCir. 1979); see also Wash. Ass’n for Television & Child., 712 F.2d at 681. That’s \nespecially true “where the obvious result would be a plain miscarriage of \njustice.” Hormel v. Helvering, 312 U.S. 552, 558 (1941). Here, FDA was \nrequired by its own regulations to respond to citizen petitions within 180 \n32 \n\nCase: 23-10362      Document: 00516710351     Page: 33     Date Filed: 04/12/2023\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 141   Filed 04/12/23    Page 33 of 42   PageID 4526\nNo. 23-10362 \ndays.  See  21  C.F.R.  § 10.30(e)(2).  Instead  of  timely  responding,  FDA \nresponded to plaintiffs’ first petition fourteen years after it was filed. And it \nresponded to the second petition over two years after it was filed. FDA \nplainly  and  repeatedly  refused  to  follow  its  own  regulations  here.  Even \nassuming any of plaintiffs’ challenges were unexhausted and that it wasn’t \nfutile to raise them before FDA, FDA’s repeated failure to follow its own \nregulations indicates that the district court did not abuse its “discretion to \nwaive exhaustion.” Wash. Ass’n for Television & Child., 712 F.2d at 681. \nD. \n  As applicants recognize, FDA’s actions are constrained by the APA’s \narbitrary-and-capricious standard. See 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). Under that \nstandard,  “the  agency  must  examine  the  relevant  data  and  articulate  a \nsatisfactory explanation for its action including a rational connection between \nthe facts found and the choice made.” Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n of U.S., Inc. \nv. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983) (quotation omitted); \nsee also Sw. Elec. Power Co. v. EPA, 920 F.3d 999, 1013 (5th Cir. 2019) (judicial \nreview of agency action “is not toothless”). We must “consider whether the \ndecision was based on a consideration of the relevant factors and whether \nthere  has  been  a  clear  error  of  judgment.”  State  Farm,  463  U.S.  at  43 \n(quotation omitted). An agency’s action is “arbitrary and capricious” if it \n“entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem, offered an \nexplanation for its decision that runs counter to the evidence before the \nagency, or is so implausible that it could not be ascribed to a difference in \nview or the product of agency expertise.” Ibid. \n  When an agency acts, it must “reasonably consider[] the relevant \nissues and reasonably explain[]” its actions. FCC v. Prometheus Radio Project, \n141  S.  Ct.  1150,  1158  (2021);  see  also  ibid.  (“The  APA’s  arbitrary-and-\ncapricious standard requires that agency action be reasonable and reasonably \n33 \n\nCase: 23-10362      Document: 00516710351     Page: 34     Date Filed: 04/12/2023\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 141   Filed 04/12/23    Page 34 of 42   PageID 4527\nNo. 23-10362 \nexplained.”); Michigan v. EPA, 576 U.S. 743, 750, 752 (2015) (“[A]gency \naction is lawful only if it rests on a consideration of the relevant factors” and \n“important aspect[s] of the problem.” (quotation omitted)). Of course, we \ncannot “substitute” our “own policy judgment for that of the agency.” \nPrometheus, 141 S. Ct. at 1158. We nonetheless must still carefully ensure that \n“the agency has acted within a zone of reasonableness and, in particular, has \nreasonably  considered  the  relevant  issues  and  reasonably  explained  the \ndecision.” Ibid. The upshot is that we “must set aside any action premised \non reasoning that fails to account for ‘relevant factors’ or evinces ‘a clear \nerror of judgment.’” Univ. of Tex. M.D. Anderson Cancer Ctr. v. HHS, 985 \nF.3d 472, 475 (5th Cir. 2021) (quoting Marsh v. Or. Nat. Res. Council, 490 \nU.S. 360, 378 (1989)). \n  Here, applicants have failed to carry their burden at this preliminary \nstage to show that FDA’s actions5 were not arbitrary and capricious. We have \ntwo principal concerns in that regard. First, FDA failed to “examine the \nrelevant data” when it made the 2016 Major REMS changes. State Farm, 463 \nU.S. at 43. That’s because FDA eliminated REMS safeguards based on \nstudies that included those very safeguards. FDA Add. 59, 122–23, 171. Imagine \nthat an agency compiles studies about how cars perform when they have \npassive restraint systems, like automatic seatbelts. See State Farm, 463 U.S. \nat 34–36. For nearly a decade, the agency collects those studies and continues \nstudying how cars perform with passive safety measures. Then one day the \nagency changes its mind and eliminates passive safety measures based only on \nexisting data of how cars perform with passive safety measures. Cf. id. at 47–\n_____________________ \n5 Here we limit our discussion to FDA’s decisions in the 2016 Major REMS \nChanges and its subsequent agency actions. As described above in Part III.B, it appears at \nthis preliminary juncture that plaintiffs’ challenges to the 2000 Approval and 2016 Petition \nDenial are untimely.  \n34 \n\nCase: 23-10362      Document: 00516710351     Page: 35     Date Filed: 04/12/2023\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 141   Filed 04/12/23    Page 35 of 42   PageID 4528\nNo. 23-10362 \n49. That was obviously arbitrary and capricious in State Farm. And so too \nhere. The fact that mifepristone might be safe when used with the 2000 \nApproval’s REMS (a question studied by FDA) says nothing about whether \nFDA can eliminate those REMS (a question not studied by FDA). \n  True, FDA studied the safety consequences of eliminating one or two \nof the 2000 Approval’s REMS in isolation. But it relied on zero studies that \nevaluated  the  safety-and-effectiveness  consequences  of  the  2016  Major \nREMS Changes as a whole. This deficiency shows that FDA failed to consider \n“an important aspect of the problem” when it made the 2016 Major REMS \nChanges. Michigan v. EPA, 576 U.S. at 752 (quotation omitted). \n  Second, the 2016 Major REMS Changes eliminated the requirement \nthat non-fatal adverse events must be reported to FDA. After eliminating that \nadverse-event  reporting  requirement,  FDA  turned  around  in  2021  and \ndeclared the absence of non-fatal adverse-event reports means mifepristone \nis  “safe.”  See,  e.g.,  FDA  Add.  861–76  (explaining  that  FDA’s  FAERS \ndatabase, which collates data on adverse events, indicated that the 2016 \nMajor REMS Changes hadn’t raised “any new safety concerns”). This \nostrich’s-head-in-the-sand  approach  is  deeply  troubling—especially  on  a \nrecord that, according to applicants’ own documents, necessitates a REMS \nprogram, a “Patient Agreement Form,” and a “Black Box” warning. See \nsupra Part III.A. And it suggests FDA’s actions are well “outside the zone of \nreasonableness.” Prometheus, 141 S. Ct. at 1160. It’s unreasonable for an \nagency to eliminate a reporting requirement for a thing and then use the \nresulting absence of data to support its decision.  \n  These actions make it unlikely that plaintiffs’ arbitrary-and-capricious \nchallenges will fail on the merits, at least as far as they challenge FDA’s \ndecisions including and following the 2016 Major REMS Changes. \n35 \n\nCase: 23-10362      Document: 00516710351     Page: 36     Date Filed: 04/12/2023\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 141   Filed 04/12/23    Page 36 of 42   PageID 4529\nNo. 23-10362 \nIV. \n  Beyond likelihood of success on the merits, we also must consider the \nother three factors for granting a stay. Those are “[A] whether the applicant \nwill be irreparably injured absent a stay; [B] whether issuance of the stay will \nsubstantially injure the other parties interested in the proceeding; and [C] \nwhere the public interest lies.” Nken, 556 U.S. at 434 (quotation omitted). \nWe address each in turn. And we (D) discuss how the Comstock Act, 18 \nU.S.C. §§ 1461, 1462 affects the stay inquiry. Outside of the 2000 Approval, \nwe find that the applicants fail to make a strong showing on any of these \nfactors for a stay.  \nA. \n  Of the remaining three factors, irreparable injury matters most. See \nNken, 556 U.S. at 434. FDA argues that the plaintiffs fail to show irreparable \ninjury. But the irreparable injury factor asks whether “the [stay] applicant will \nbe irreparably injured” absent a stay, not whether the plaintiff would be \nirreparably injured absent an injunction. Ibid. (emphasis added) (quotation \nomitted). Similarly, FDA’s assertion that the district court’s injunction will \nharm pregnant women or other members of the public does not speak to the \nirreparable injury factor (although it may speak to other factors), because \nthose persons are not stay applicants in this case.  \n  Since FDA does not articulate any irreparable harm that FDA will \nsuffer absent a stay, it makes no showing on this “critical” prong. Ibid. We \nmay not need to address the merits of the applicants’ stay request any further, \nbecause  failure  to  show  irreparable  injury  often  “decides  the  [stay] \napplication.” Whalen v. Roe, 423 U.S. 1313, 1318 (1975) (Marshall, J., in \nchambers). \n  Danco by contrast does claim it will suffer irreparable injury, albeit in \njust one paragraph. Danco notes that mifepristone is its sole product and \n36 \n\nCase: 23-10362      Document: 00516710351     Page: 37     Date Filed: 04/12/2023\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 141   Filed 04/12/23    Page 37 of 42   PageID 4530\nNo. 23-10362 \nargues  that it  may  have  to  shut  down  absent  relief.  We  have  held  that \ncatastrophic financial losses “may be sufficient to show irreparable injury.” \nWages & White Lion Investments, LLC v. FDA, 16 F.4th 1130, 1142 (5th Cir. \n2021) (emphasis added) (quotation omitted). Of course, irreparable injury \nalone does not entitle Danco to a stay. See Virginian Ry. Co., 272 U.S. at 672. \n  And even if it did, neither FDA nor Danco articulates why this, or any \nother, injury would require a stay of all of the district court’s order, rather \nthan only part. Recall that we may narrowly “tailor a stay” to impact “only \nsome portion of the proceeding.” Int’l Refugee Assistance Project, 137 S. Ct. at \n2087 (quotation omitted). The applicants’ arguments suggest, at best, that \nthey require relief only from the district court’s treatment  of the 2000 \nApproval. They make no argument as to why the district court’s treatment \nof the 2016 Major REMS Changes and later FDA activity irreparably harms \nanyone.  \n  Applicants’ forfeiture of this contention is understandable because \nthe world operated under the 2000 Approval for sixteen years, apparently \nwithout problems. And neither applicant contends that it’ll be irreparably \ninjured without a stay so long as the 2000 Approval and its associated REMS \nremain in effect. Thus, the irreparable injury factor counsels against a stay. \nB. \n  The  next  Nken  factor  asks  whether  “issuance  of  the  stay  will \nsubstantially injure the other parties interested in the proceeding.” 556 U.S. \nat 434 (quoting Hilton, 481 U.S. at 776); see also Ala. Ass’n of Realtors, 141 S. \nCt. at 2487 (same); Planned Parenthood v. Abbott, 134 S. Ct. 506, 506–08 \n(2013) (mem.) (opinions of seven Justices using the same standard). This \nlanguage again focuses on harm from the stay, not the injunction. Cf. Whole \nWoman’s Health, 141 S. Ct. at 2495 (using less specific “balance of the \nequities” language). To succeed on this prong, applicants must show that the \n37 \n\nCase: 23-10362      Document: 00516710351     Page: 38     Date Filed: 04/12/2023\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 141   Filed 04/12/23    Page 38 of 42   PageID 4531\nNo. 23-10362 \nrequested stay will not harm the opposing appellees or other interested \nparties. \n  Applicants discuss at length their view that the district court’s order \nmight harm various persons, but mostly decline to address the apposite \nquestion, which is why the requested stay would not harm relevant persons. \nWhat points the applicants do make on this relevant question distill down to \ntwo arguments.  \n  First, applicants briefly argue that the injuries the plaintiffs would \nsuffer from a stay are speculative or minimal. But we have already addressed \nwhy plaintiffs’ injuries are non-speculative. See supra Part III.A. We have also \naddressed the specific risks impacting women and the plaintiffs that stem \nfrom the 2016 Major REMS Changes and other post-2016 FDA decisions \nthat the district court enjoined. See supra Part III.A, D. The applicants’ \nabbreviated argument focuses on consequences flowing from the district \ncourt’s  treatment  of  the  2000  Approval  and  largely  ignores  plaintiffs’ \nalternative arguments regarding the 2016 Major REMS Changes and what \nfollowed.  \n             Second,  the  applicants  argue  that  the  plaintiffs’  failure  to  bring \nlitigation sooner undercuts any contention that they would be harmed from a \nstay.  That  contention  is  untenable  given  FDA’s  fourteen-year  delay  in \nadjudicating the 2002 Citizen Petition. But, even setting aside FDA’s own \ndelays,  the  applicants  do  not  explain  why  the  plaintiffs’  alleged \nprocrastination warrants a stay of the entirety of the district court’s order, \nrather than just the portion of the order impacted by long litigation delay (the \n2000 Approval).  \n            To the extent applicants make any showing that the third Nken factor \nfavors a stay, they do so only with respect to the 2000 Approval and do not \naddress plaintiffs’ alternative arguments.  \n38 \n\nCase: 23-10362      Document: 00516710351     Page: 39     Date Filed: 04/12/2023\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 141   Filed 04/12/23    Page 39 of 42   PageID 4532\nNo. 23-10362 \nC. \n            The last Nken factor asks “where the public interest lies.” 556 U.S. at \n434  (quotation  omitted).  The  stay  applicants  make  three  principal \narguments.  \n            First, the applicants argue that “procedural irregularity” in the court \nbelow favors relief. But the applicants do not explain why any specific alleged \nirregularity necessarily speaks to public (versus their own private) interest. \nEven if we assume away that problem, it is not clear to us, on our accelerated \nreview, that any litigation below was irregular. And even if we assume, which \nwe do not, that the district court or the plaintiffs departed from acceptable \nprocedure, it’s unclear on this record that applicants have embraced “the \nprinciples of equity and righteous dealing” in the twenty-one years since the \nfiling of the 2002 Citizen Petition. Binh Hoa Le v. Exeter Fin. Corp., 990 F.3d \n410, 416 (5th Cir. 2021) (quotation omitted) (noting that a party’s own \nimperfect conduct can prejudice their request for equitable relief). \n            Second, Danco argues that avoidance of “judicial conflict” warrants a \nstay  given  the  order  of  an  out-of-circuit  district court.  Comity  between \nfederal courts is a cognizable interest. See Def. Distrib. v. Platkin, 55 F.4th \n486, 495–96 (5th Cir. 2022). We have every respect for fellow federal courts. \nBut we cannot embrace an argument that would, in effect, allow the decision \nof an out-of-circuit district court to impel us towards “extraordinary” relief \nthat would be otherwise inappropriate. Williams, 442 U.S. at 1311 (quotation \nomitted).  \n            Third, the stay applicants warn us of significant public consequences \nshould the district court’s order result in the withdrawal of mifepristone from \nthe  market.  These  consequences,  the  applicants  say,  include  injury  to \npregnant women, to public healthcare systems, and to the sense of order that \ngoverns FDA drug approvals. But these concerns center on the  district \n39 \n\nCase: 23-10362      Document: 00516710351     Page: 40     Date Filed: 04/12/2023\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 141   Filed 04/12/23    Page 40 of 42   PageID 4533\nNo. 23-10362 \ncourt’s removal of mifepristone from the market. The applicants make no \narguments as to why the 2016 Major REMS Changes, the 2019 Generic \nApproval, or the 2021 and 2023 Mail Order Decisions are similarly critical to \nthe public even though they were on notice of plaintiffs’ alternative requests \nfor relief. And it would be difficult for applicants to argue that the 2016 Major \nREMS Changes and subsequent FDA activity were so critical to the public \ngiven  that  the  Nation  operated—and  mifepristone  was  administered  to \nmillions  of  women—without  them  for  sixteen  years  following  the  2000 \nApproval.  \n  The  applicants  have made  some  showing  that  the  public  interest \nwarrants equitable relief from the district court’s treatment of the 2000 \nApproval. Motivated in part by the accelerated posture of our review, we \ncredit their showing. \nD. \nThe parties vehemently dispute how their competing interpretations \nof the Comstock Act of 1873 might impact the validity of the district court’s \norder. The Comstock Act prohibits the carriage in interstate commerce of \n“any drug, medicine, article, or thing designed, adapted or intended for \nproducing abortion.” 18 U.S.C. § 1462. It similarly prohibits the mailing of \nany  “article,  instrument,  substance,  drug,  medicine,  or  thing  which  is \nadvertised or described in a manner calculated to lead another to use or apply \nit for producing abortion.” Id. § 1461. \n             Both  statutory provisions  specify  a mens  rea  of  “knowingly.”  Id. \n§§ 1461–62. The plain text does not require that a user of the mails or \ncommon interstate carriage intend that an abortion actually occur. Rather, a \nuser of those shipping channels violates the plain text merely by knowingly \nmaking use of the mail for a prohibited abortion item. \n40 \n\nCase: 23-10362      Document: 00516710351     Page: 41     Date Filed: 04/12/2023\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 141   Filed 04/12/23    Page 41 of 42   PageID 4534\nNo. 23-10362 \n            The applicants’ principal defense against the Comstock Act is that \nFDA was not required to consider it. After all, say the applicants, 21 U.S.C. \n§§ 355 and 355-1 guide FDA’s discretion over drug approval and REMS, and \nthose statutes do not explicitly require consideration of other statutes like 14 \nU.S.C. § 1462. \n            Even assuming that’s true, however, the Comstock Act nevertheless \nundermines  applicants’  showing  on  the  final  three  Nken  factors.  For \nexample, if the Comstock Act is construed in-line with its literal terms, then \nDanco cannot say it is irreparably harmed by the district court’s order, \nbecause Danco has no interest in continuing to violate the law, which (under \na plain view of the Act) it does every time it ships mifepristone. For further \nexample, if the Comstock Act is strictly understood, then applicants may lose \nthe public interest prong entirely, because there is no public interest in the \nperpetuation of illegality. See Louisiana v. Biden, 55 F.4th 1017, 1035 (5th Cir. \n2022).  \n            The applicants raise other defenses. For example, they argue that the \nFood and Drug Administration Amendments Act, Pub. L. No. 110-85, 121 \nStat. 823 (2007) (“FDAAA”) sub silentio repealed the Comstock Act, at least \nwhere  mifepristone  is  concerned.  That’s  because  the  FDAAA  in  2007 \ncreated a statutory framework governing REMS and drugs with then-existing \ndistribution restrictions. See id. § 909(b). Mifepristone was one such drug. \nSo, say applicants, the FDAAA acted to legalize shipment of mifepristone, \nregardless of what the Comstock Act might say. But “repeals by implication \nare not favored.” Maine Cmty. Health Options v. United States, 140 S. Ct. \n1308,  1323  (2020)  (quotation  omitted).  We  regard  each  of  Congress’s \nstatutes as effective unless either “intention to repeal” one of them is “clear \nand  manifest”  or  the  two  laws  are  “irreconcilable.”  Ibid.  (quotation \nomitted). Section 909(b) did not expressly legalize mifepristone; agency \naction (not statute) did that. Section 909(b)’s brief text makes no mention of \n41 \n\nCase: 23-10362      Document: 00516710351     Page: 42     Date Filed: 04/12/2023\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 141   Filed 04/12/23    Page 42 of 42   PageID 4535\nNo. 23-10362 \nmifepristone at all. So, there is no “irreconcilable” conflict. And we hesitate \nto find “clear and manifest” intention to repeal a 150-year-old statute that \nCongress has otherwise repeatedly declined to alter in the far reaches of a \nsingle section of the cavernous FDAAA. \n            Failing all else, the applicants argue that the Comstock Act does not \nmean what it says it means. Or rather, that judicial gloss and lax enforcement \nover the past century act to graft relevant exceptions onto it. The applicants \nrely on a memo authored by the Office of Legal Counsel to press this position. \nSee FDA Add. 258–78. That memo’s thorough exploration of this topic notes \nthat a variety of aging out-of-circuit opinions and a single footnote within one \nSupreme Court dissent favor the applicants’ position. FDA Add. 262–68).  \nThe speed of our review does not permit conclusive exploration of this \ntopic.  To  the  extent  the  Comstock  Act  introduces  uncertainty  into  the \nultimate merits of the case, that uncertainty favors the plaintiffs because the \napplicants bear the burden of winning a stay. See Landis, 299 U.S. at 255. \nSince plaintiffs already prevail on most Nken factors concerning most of the \nagency items effectively enjoined by the district court’s order, we need not \ndefinitively interpret the Comstock Act to resolve this stay application. \n*  *  * \n  As the stay applicants, defendants bear the burden of showing why \n“extraordinary circumstances” demand that we exercise discretion in their \nfavor. To the extent the defendants make any such showing, they do so only \nwith respect to the 2000 Approval—not the plaintiffs’ alternative arguments \nchallenging FDA’s 2016 Major REMS Changes and all subsequent actions. \nOur decision to grant partial relief does not reflect our view on any merits \nquestion. The defendants’ motions to stay the district court’s order are \nGRANTED  IN  PART  and  DENIED  IN  PART.  The  appeal  is \nEXPEDITED to the next available Oral Argument Calendar. \n42 ",

Plaintiffs challenge these \nsix FDA actions and ask that the Court hold them unlawful, set them aside, and \nvacate them.  \n  Beginning in January 1993, on his second full day in office, President \nBill Clinton directed his cabinet to legalize chemical abortion drugs in the United \nStates. \n  President Clinton and his agency officials then pressured the French \nmanufacturer of the key chemical abortion drug, mifepristone (also known as “RU-\n486” and “Mifeprex”), to donate for free the U.S. patent rights of the drug to the \nPopulation Council—as its name suggests, an entity focused on population control.  \n  After receiving the patent rights to mifepristone, the Population \nCouncil submitted a new drug application, worked closely with the Clinton FDA \nduring the review process, and, not surprisingly, obtained the agency’s approval on \n2 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 1   Filed 11/18/22    Page 3 of 113   PageID 3\n \nSeptember 28, 2000—just over one month before the closely contested 2000 U.S. \npresidential election. \n  The only way the FDA could have approved chemical abortion drugs \nwas to use its accelerated drug approval authority, necessitating the FDA to call \npregnancy an “illness” and argue that these dangerous drugs provide a “meaningful \ntherapeutic benefit” over existing treatments.  \n  But pregnancy is not an illness, nor do chemical abortion drugs provide \na therapeutic benefit over surgical abortion. In asserting these transparently false \nconclusions, the FDA exceeded its regulatory authority to approve the drugs. \n  What’s more, the FDA needed to disavow science and the law because \nthe FDA never studied the safety of the drugs under the labeled conditions of use \ndespite being required to do so by the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act \n(FFDCA). The agency also ignored the potential impacts of the hormone-blocking \nregimen on the developing bodies of adolescent girls in violation of the Pediatric \nResearch and Equity Act (PREA). And the FDA disregarded the substantial \nevidence that chemical abortion drugs cause more complications than even surgical \nabortions. \n  Since then, the FDA has not followed the science, reversed course, or \nfixed its mistakes—all to the detriment of women and girls. Instead, the FDA has \ndoubled down on its actions and removed the few safeguards that were in place.  \n  In March 2016—fourteen years after two Plaintiffs filed a citizen \npetition with the FDA asking the agency to withdraw its approval of chemical \n3 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 1   Filed 11/18/22    Page 4 of 113   PageID 4\n \nabortion drugs—the FDA rejected these Plaintiffs’ petition despite their \nexplanations that the agency violated federal laws by approving these drugs and \nignoring the substantial evidence that these drugs harm women and girls. \n  On the same day that the FDA rejected the citizen petition and mere \nmonths before another U.S. presidential election, the FDA also made “major \nchanges” to the chemical abortion drug regimen, eliminating crucial safeguards for \npregnant women and girls.  \n  For example, the FDA extended the permissible gestational age of the \nbaby for which a pregnant woman or girl may take chemical abortion drugs—from \nseven weeks to ten weeks.  \n  Numerous studies have demonstrated that there is an increased risk \nfrom chemical abortion drugs to pregnant women and girls as the baby’s age \nadvances from seven weeks to ten weeks because the surface area of the placenta as \nwell as the size of the baby significantly grow during these three weeks. \n  Also in 2016, the FDA changed the dosage and route of administration \nfor the chemical abortion drugs, reduced the number of required in-person office \nvisits from three to one, expanded who could prescribe and administer chemical \nabortion drugs beyond medical doctors, and eliminated the requirement for \nabortionists to report non-fatal complications from chemical abortion drugs—\nwithout requiring any objective clinical investigations or studies that evaluated the \nsafety and effectiveness of this new chemical abortion regimen or any safety \nassessment of its effects on the developing bodies of girls under 18 years of age. \n4 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 1   Filed 11/18/22    Page 5 of 113   PageID 5\n \n  These major changes failed to satisfy the rigorous scientific standards \nof the FFDCA and violated PREA’s requirement for a specific safety assessment of \nthese changes on pregnant girls who undergo the revised chemical abortion drug \nregimen. \n  Realizing a profit-making opportunity in the rapidly growing chemical \nabortion business, another entity sought the FDA’s approval to market and \ndistribute a generic version of mifepristone. In 2019, the FDA obliged and approved \nthe generic drug—without requiring any new clinical investigations or studies that \nevaluated the drug’s safety and effectiveness under the requirements of the FFDCA, \nnor any specific safety assessments on girls as set forth under PREA. \n  A couple of years later, in April of 2021, shortly after President Joe \nBiden took office, the FDA’s new management issued a “Non-Enforcement Decision” \nby which the agency would stop enforcing its requirement that abortionists provide \nin-person dispensing of mifepristone and instead would temporarily allow mail-\norder chemical abortions during the COVID-19 public health emergency. \n  In December 2021—two-and-a-half years after two Plaintiffs filed a \ncitizen petition asking the FDA to restore and strengthen the pre-2016 chemical \nabortion drug regimen or, at minimum, to preserve the few remaining safeguards \nfor women and girls—the FDA rejected almost all of these Plaintiffs’ citizen \npetition. The FDA issued its denial despite their discussion of how the agency \nviolated the law by ignoring the growing and substantial evidence that these \ndangerous drugs harm women and girls. \n5 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 1   Filed 11/18/22    Page 6 of 113   PageID 6\n \n  On the same day that it rejected the citizen petition, the Biden FDA \nalso announced that it would permanently allow abortionists to send chemical \nabortion drugs through the mail.  \n  This decision not only harms women and girls who voluntarily undergo \nchemical abortions, but it also further helps sex traffickers and sexual abusers to \nforce their victims into getting abortions while preventing the authorities from \nidentifying these victims.1 In fact, the State of Texas has recognized that “[d]ue to \nthe potentially high number of trafficking victims who undergo abortion procedures, \nabortion facility employees are uniquely situated to identify and assist victims of \nsex trafficking.”2 \n  In addition to the legal and scientific infirmities referenced above, all \nof the FDA’s actions on chemical abortion drugs—the 2000 approval, the 2016 major \nchanges, the 2019 generic drug approval, and the two 2021 actions to eliminate the \nin-person dispensing requirement—failed to acknowledge and address the federal \nlaws that prohibit the distribution of chemical abortion drugs by postal mail, \n \n1 See, e.g., Ex. 1, Laura J.

Introduction \n  This case challenges the FDA’s failure to abide by its legal obligations \nto protect the health, safety, and welfare of women and girls8 when the agency \nauthorized the chemical abortion drugs mifepristone and misoprostol for use in the \n \n8 The FDA’s approval of chemical abortion lacks an age restriction and, therefore, \npermits the use of the drug regimen by a pregnant girl of any age under 18 years. \n14 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 1   Filed 11/18/22    Page 15 of 113   PageID 15\n \nUnited States and subsequently eliminated necessary safeguards for pregnant \nwomen and girls who undergo this dangerous drug regimen. \n  First, the FDA never had the authority to approve these drugs for sale. \nIn 2000, the FDA approved chemical abortion drugs under 21 C.F.R. § 314, Subpart \nH (Subpart H). This regulation authorizes the FDA to grant “accelerated approval” \nof “certain new drug products that have been studied for their safety and \neffectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide \nmeaningful therapeutic benefit to patients over existing treatments.” 21 C.F.R. \n§ 314.500 (emphasis added).  \n  But chemical abortion drugs do not treat serious or life-threatening \nillnesses. Indeed, pregnancy is a normal physiological state that many females \nexperience one or more times during their childbearing years. Pregnancy rarely \nleads to complications that threaten the life of the mother or the child. Following \ndelivery, almost all women return to a normal routine without disability.9 \n  Likewise, chemical abortion drugs do not provide a “meaningful \ntherapeutic benefit” to women and girls over existing treatments.  \n  To the contrary, the FDA’s approval of chemical abortion drugs has \npotentially serious and life-threatening effects on women and girls, especially when \n \n9 Ex. 11, Byron Calhoun, The maternal mortality myth in the context of legalized \nabortion, 80 The Linacre Quarterly 264, 264–276 (2013); James Studnicki & Tessa \nLongbons, Pregnancy Is Not More Dangerous Than Abortion, Nat’l Rev.

The Chemical Abortion Regimen and Its Adverse Health Effects \n  The chemical abortion drug regimen requires the use of two drugs: \n(1) mifepristone (also known as “RU-486” and “Mifeprex”) and (2) misoprostol.  \n  As an endocrine disruptor, mifepristone is a synthetic steroid that \nblocks progesterone receptors in the uterus of a woman or girl. The hormone \nprogesterone is necessary for the healthy growth of a baby and the maintenance of a \npregnancy. When a woman or girl ingests the chemical abortion drug mifepristone, \nthe drug blocks the action of the natural hormone progesterone, chemically destroys \nthe baby’s environment in the uterus, blocks nutrition to the baby, and ultimately \nstarves the baby to death in the mother’s womb.10  \n  Because mifepristone alone works less than 25 percent of the time to \ncomplete the abortion, the FDA’s chemical abortion drug regimen mandates the use \n \n10 See Ex. 4, Harrison Decl. at ¶ 21; Ex. 8, Skop Decl. at ¶ 10; Ex. 12, The FDA and \nRU-486: Lowering the Standard for Women’s Health: Hearing Before the Subcomm. \non Crim.

Specifically, the FDA must comply with \nthe Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), the Pediatric Research Equity \nAct of 2003 (PREA), and the agency’s regulations.

New Drug Applications Under the Federal Food, Drug, and \nCosmetic Act \n  Under the FFDCA, anyone seeking to introduce into commerce and \ndistribute any new drug in the United States must first obtain the FDA’s approval \nby filing a new drug application (NDA). 21 U.S.C. § 355(a). \n  A drug may be considered “new” by reason of the “newness of use of \nsuch drug in diagnosing, curing, mitigating, treating, or preventing a disease, or to \naffect a structure or function of the body, even though such drug is not a new drug \nwhen used in another disease or to affect another structure or function of the body.” \n21 C.F.R. § 310.3(h)(4). A drug may also be considered “new” by reason of the \n“newness of a dosage, or method or duration of administration or application, or \nother condition of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the labeling of such \ndrug, even though such drug . . . is not a new drug.” Id. § 310.3(h)(5). \n  The NDA must contain extensive scientific data showing the safety \nand effectiveness of the drug. 21 U.S.C. § 355(d); 21 C.F.R. § 314.125. \n  Under the FFDCA, the FDA must reject an application if the clinical \ninvestigations “do not include adequate tests by all methods reasonably applicable \nto show whether or not such drug is safe for use under the conditions prescribed, \nrecommended, or suggested in the proposed labeling thereof.” 21 U.S.C. § 355(d); \n21 C.F.R. § 314.125(b)(2). \n  The FDA must also reject an application if “the results of such tests \nshow that such drug is unsafe for use under such conditions or do not show that \n23 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 1   Filed 11/18/22    Page 24 of 113   PageID 24\n \nsuch drug is safe for use under such conditions.” 21 U.S.C. § 355(d); 21 C.F.R. \n§ 314.125(b)(3). \n  The FDA shall refuse an application if, based upon information \nsubmitted to the agency or upon the basis of any other information before the \nagency, the FDA “has insufficient information to determine whether such drug is \nsafe for use under such conditions.” 21 U.S.C. § 355(d); 21 C.F.R. § 314.125(b)(4). \n  Finally, the FDA must deny an application if “there is a lack of \nsubstantial evidence that the new drug will have the effect it purports or is \nrepresented to have under the conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or \nsuggested in the proposed labeling thereof.” 21 U.S.C. § 355(d); 21 C.F.R. § \n314.125(b)(5). \n  The FFDCA defines “substantial evidence” as “evidence consisting of \nadequate and well-controlled investigations, including clinical investigations, by \nexperts qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate the effectiveness \nof the drug involved, on the basis of which it could fairly and responsibly be \nconcluded by such experts that the drug will have the effect it purports or is \nrepresented to have under the conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or \nsuggested in the labeling or proposed labeling thereof.” 21 U.S.C. § 355(d). \n  If a sponsor of an approved drug subsequently seeks to change the \nlabeling, market a new dosage or strength of the drug, or change the way it \nmanufactures a drug, the company must submit a supplemental new drug \n24 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 1   Filed 11/18/22    Page 25 of 113   PageID 25\n \napplication (sNDA) seeking the FDA’s approval of such changes. 21 U.S.C. § 355(b); \n21 C.F.R. §§ 314.54, 314.70. \n  Only the sponsor “may submit a supplement to an application.” 21 \nC.F.R. § 314.71(a). \n  “All procedures and actions that apply to an application under [21 \nC.F.R.] § 314.50 also apply to supplements, except that the information required in \nthe supplement is limited to that needed to support the change.” 21 C.F.R. \n§ 314.71(b); see also 21 C.F.R. § 314.54(a) (“application need contain only that \ninformation needed to support the modification(s) of the listed drug”). \n  The sNDA must also show that the drug is safe and effective for “the \nconditions of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the proposed labeling.” \n21 U.S.C. § 355(d). \n  The FFDCA allows a generic drug manufacturer to submit an \nabbreviated new drug application (ANDA) for approval to introduce into commerce \nand distribute a generic version of an approved drug. 21 U.S.C. § 355(j). \n  In the ANDA, the generic drug manufacturer must show, among other \nthings, that (a) the conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the \nlabeling proposed for the new drug have been previously approved for a drug listed \nand (b) the drug product is chemically the same as the already approved drug, \nallowing it to rely on the FDA’s previous finding of safety and effectiveness for the \napproved drug. The route of administration, dosage form, and strength must also be \nthe same. 21 U.S.C. § 355(j); 21 C.F.R. § 314.94. \n25 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 1   Filed 11/18/22    Page 26 of 113   PageID 26\n \nB.  Assessments on Pediatric Populations \n  In 1998, the FDA issued a regulation, called the Pediatric Rule, \nrequiring an assessment specifically powered to determine the safety and \neffectiveness of a new drug on pediatric patients.29 This rule allowed for full or \npartial waivers of its pediatric assessment requirements, set forth under then 21 \nC.F.R. § 314.55(c). \n  A federal district court subsequently held that the FDA had exceeded \nits statutory authority when issuing the Pediatric Rule and thus enjoined the FDA \nfrom enforcing the regulation. See Ass’n of Am. Physicians & Surgeons v. FDA, 226 \nF. Supp. 2d 204 (D.D.C. 2002). \n  In response, President George W. Bush and Congress enacted PREA to \ncodify the Pediatric Rule legislatively. This law expressly requires studies on the \nsafety and effectiveness of drugs intended for pediatric populations, unless certain \nexceptions apply. The FDA may require an assessment on the drug’s safety and \neffectiveness, extrapolate findings from studies on adult populations, or waive the \nassessment for pediatric populations. 21 U.S.C. § 355c. \n  In general, PREA requires an application or supplement to an \napplication for a drug to include an assessment on the safety and effectiveness of \nthe drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations. 21 \nU.S.C. § 355c(a)(2)(A)(i). This assessment must also support dosing and \n \n29 Ex. 21, Regulations Requiring Manufacturers to Assess the Safety and \nEffectiveness of New Drugs and Biological Products in Pediatric Patients, 63 Fed. \nReg. 66,632 (Dec. 2, 1998). \n26 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 1   Filed 11/18/22    Page 27 of 113   PageID 27\n \nadministration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the drug is safe and \neffective. 21 U.S.C. § 355c(a)(2)(A)(ii). \n  Under limited circumstances, PREA allows the FDA to avoid this \nassessment and, instead, extrapolate the safety and effectiveness of a drug for \npediatric populations: “If the course of the disease and the effects of the drug are \nsufficiently similar in adults and pediatric patients, the [FDA] may conclude that \npediatric effectiveness can be extrapolated from adequate and well-controlled \nstudies in adults, usually supplemented with other information obtained in \npediatric patients.” 21 U.S.C. § 355c(2)(B)(i) (emphasis added). \n  To support this extrapolation, the FDA must include “brief \ndocumentation of the scientific data supporting the conclusion” that the course of \nthe disease and the effects of the drug are sufficiently similar in adults and \npediatric patients. 21 U.S.C. § 355c(B)(iii) (emphasis added). \n  In addition, PREA also allows the FDA to grant a full or partial waiver \nof the requirement for pediatric assessments or reports on the investigation for a \ndrug if one of the following situations exists: (1) “necessary studies are impossible or \nhighly impracticable”; (2) “there is evidence strongly suggesting that the drug or \nbiological product would be ineffective or unsafe in all pediatric age groups”; or (3) \nthe drug “does not represent a meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing \ntherapies for pediatric patients” and it “is not likely to be used in a substantial \nnumber of pediatric patients.” 21 U.S.C. § 355c(a)(5)(A), (B). \n27 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 1   Filed 11/18/22    Page 28 of 113   PageID 28\n \n  PREA also deemed a waiver or deferral issued under the Pediatric \nRule between April 1, 1999, and December 3, 2003, to be a waiver or deferral under \n21 U.S.C. § 355c(a). 21 U.S.C. § 355c note. \nC.  Subpart H Regulations for Accelerated Approval of Certain \nNew Drugs for Serious and Life-Threatening Illnesses \n  Both the FFDCA and PREA serve as the primary laws governing the \nFDA’s review and approval of new drugs. The FDA has also implemented certain \nregulations to effectuate its legal obligations under these laws and to address \ncertain public health crises over the years. \n  For example, on December 11, 1992, the FDA published the final rule, \n“New Drug, Antibiotic, and Biological Drug Product Regulations; Accelerated \nApproval.”30  \n  This final rule established procedures “under which FDA will \naccelerate approval of certain new drugs and biological products for serious or life-\nthreatening illnesses, with provision for required continued study of the drugs’ \nclinical benefits after approval or for restrictions on distribution or use, where those \nare necessary for safe use of the drugs.”31 \n  The FDA intended these procedures “to provide expedited marketing of \ndrugs for patients suffering from such illnesses when the drugs provide a \nmeaningful therapeutic advantage over existing treatment.”32 \n \n30 Ex. 22, New Drug, Antibiotic, and Biological Drug Product Regulations; \nAccelerated Approval, 57 Fed. Reg. 58,942 (Dec. 11, 1992). \n31 Id. (emphasis added). \n32 Id.

Drugs Approved with Previous Subpart H Restrictions Deemed \nto Have Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies \n  Congress decided to codify into law the FDA’s postmarketing \nregulations under Subpart H when it enacted the Food and Drug Administration \nAmendments Act of 2007 (FDAAA) and created a new section of the FFDCA under \n21 U.S.C. § 355-1. This new section authorizes the FDA to require persons \nsubmitting certain new drug applications to submit and implement a risk \nevaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) if the FDA determines that a REMS is \n“necessary to ensure that the benefits of a drug outweigh the risks of the drug.” \n21 U.S.C. § 355-1(a).  \n  Section 909(b)(1) of the FDAAA specified that a “drug that was \napproved before the effective date of this Act is . . . deemed to have in effect an \n \n33 Ex. 22, 57 Fed. Reg. at 58,952. \n30 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 1   Filed 11/18/22    Page 31 of 113   PageID 31\n \napproved [REMS] . . . if there are in effect on the effective date of this Act elements \nto assure safe use [pursuant to Subpart H, 21 C.F.R. § 514.520].” H.R. 3580, 110th \nCong. (2007). Thus, if the FDA previously attached postmarketing restrictions on a \ndrug approved under Subpart H, the FDAAA converted those restrictions into a \nREMS. \n  Under the FDAAA, to allow safe access to drugs with known serious \nrisks, the FDA may require that the REMS “include such elements as are necessary \nto assure safe use of the drug, because of its inherent toxicity or potential \nharmfulness” if the agency determines that the drug “is associated with a serious \nadverse drug experience.” 21 U.S.C. § 355-1(f)(1). \n  These “Elements to Assure Safe Use” (ETASU) may require \n(1) prescribers of the drug “have particular training or experience” or be “specially \ncertified,” (2) practitioners or health care settings that dispense the drug be \n“specially certified,” (3) doctors dispense the drug to patients “only in certain health \ncare settings, such as hospitals,” (4) doctors dispense the drug to patients “with \nevidence or other documentation of safe-use conditions, such as laboratory test \nresults,” (5) each patient be subject to “certain monitoring,” and (6) each patient be \nenrolled in a “registry.” 21 U.S.C. § 355-1(f)(3). \n  The FDA may also require an applicant to monitor and evaluate \nimplementation of the REMS, in addition to working to improve those elements. \n21 U.S.C. § 355-1(g). \n31 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 1   Filed 11/18/22    Page 32 of 113   PageID 32\n \n  The FDA may also include a communication plan to health care \nproviders as part of the REMS to disseminate certain information about the drug \nand its risks. 21 U.S.C. § 355-1(e)(3). \n  An applicant “may propose the addition, modification, or removal of \n[the REMS] . . . and shall include an adequate rationale to support such proposed \naddition, modification, or removal.” 21 U.S.C. § 355-1(g)(4)(A). \nIV.  Federal Laws Restrict Distribution of Chemical Abortion Drugs \n  Two federal laws restrict the distribution of abortion-inducing drugs. \n18 U.S.C. §§ 1461–62. These laws apply to both upstream and downstream \ndistribution. \n  First, 18 U.S.C. § 1461 prohibits the use of postal “mails” to convey or \ndeliver chemical abortion drugs. Specifically, it prohibits the mailing or delivery by \nany letter carrier of “[e]very article or thing designed, adapted, or intended for \nproducing abortion” and “[e]very article, instrument, substance, drug, medicine, or \nthing, which is advertised or described in a manner calculated to lead to another to \nuse or apply it for producing abortion.”  \n  Second, 18 U.S.C. § 1462 broadly prohibits the use of “any express \ncompany or other common carrier” to transport abortion drugs in interstate or \nforeign commerce.

The agency explained that the \napproved labeling states that the safety and efficacy for girls under 18 years of age \n“have not been studied” because the raw data from this limited study had not been \nsubmitted for review, the pediatric population was not part of the NDA indication, \nthe data on safety and effectiveness were only reviewed for the indication’s age \ngroup (18–35 years of age), and the clinical trials excluded patients younger than 18 \nyears old.74  \n  The FDA believed it would eventually overcome this data deficiency \nbecause the Population Council would “collect outcomes in their [post-approval] \n \n71 Id. \n72 Ex. 25, 2000 Approval Letter at 3. \n73 Ex. 24, 2000 Approval Memo. at 7. \n74 Id. \n41 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 1   Filed 11/18/22    Page 42 of 113   PageID 42\n \nstudies of women of all ages to further study this issue”75—even though those \nstudies were not designed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of mifepristone on \ngirls under the age of 18 years.  \n  But the FDA released the Population Council from its obligation to \nconduct these studies in 2008.76 \n  Therefore, since the 2000 Approval, the FDA has continued to allow \npregnant girls of any age to take chemical abortion drugs—despite never requiring a \nstudy specifically designed to determine the safety and effectiveness of these drugs. \n  With the FDA approval in hand, the Population Council then granted \nDanco Laboratories, LLC (“Danco”), which was incorporated in the Cayman Islands \nin 1995, an exclusive license to manufacture, market, and distribute Mifeprex in the \nUnited States.77 \nVII.  2002 Citizen Petition \n  The FDA’s regulations prohibit a litigant from going straight to court \nto challenge the agency’s approval of a new drug.

Part 314, Subpart H (§§ \n314.500–314.560); and Section 505 of the FFDCA (21 U.S.C. § 355).78 \n  The 2002 Petitioners requested that the FDA impose an immediate \nstay of the approval of mifepristone and ultimately revoke the approval, in addition \nto requesting a full FDA audit of the underlying clinical studies.79 \n  The 2002 Petitioners stated that the FDA’s approval of mifepristone in \n2000 violated the APA for many reasons, including because it was arbitrary, \ncapricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with the law, \ngiven that (1) the FDA lacked the authority to approve mifepristone under Subpart \nH and (2) the FDA incorporated misoprostol as part of the chemical abortion \nregimen despite not receiving an sNDA for this new use of the drug.80 \n  The 2002 Petitioners explained how the 2000 Approval violated \nSubpart H because pregnancy, without major complications, is not a “serious or life-\nthreatening illness” for purposes of this accelerated approval authority. “Thus, \n \n78 Id. at 1. \n79 Id. \n80 Id. at 18–23, 41–48. \n43 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 1   Filed 11/18/22    Page 44 of 113   PageID 44\n \npregnancy is not the kind of exceptional circumstance that falls within the scope of \nSubpart H. The fact that the Mifeprex Regimen is intended for healthy women \nprovides further evidence of this point.”81 \n  Moreover, “there is a less dangerous, more effective alternative to \nMifeprex available for the termination of pregnancies: namely, surgical abortions.” \nNor does mifepristone “treat a subset of the female population that is unresponsive \nto, or intolerant of surgical abortion.” Indeed, as the 2000 Mifeprex label \nacknowledged, because “medical abortion failures should be managed with surgical \ntermination,” the option for surgical abortion must be available for any woman or \ngirl who undergoes chemical abortion.82  \n  Nor did the clinical trials compare chemical abortion with the existing \n“therapy,” surgical abortion, to support a finding of a “meaningful therapeutic \nbenefit over existing treatments.”83 \n  The 2002 Petitioners also pointed out that the clinical trials that the \nPopulation Council submitted to support its NDA failed to present “substantial \nevidence” that the mifepristone regimen is safe and effective.84 \n  In fact, as the 2002 Citizen Petition demonstrated, the FDA’s 2000 \nApproval has endangered women’s lives because it lacked the necessary safeguards \nfor this dangerous regimen. For instance, the FDA failed to require an ultrasound, \n \n81 Id. at 19. \n82 Id. at 21–22. \n83 Id. at 37. \n84 Id. at 24–41. \n44 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 1   Filed 11/18/22    Page 45 of 113   PageID 45\n \nwhich is necessary both to determine an accurate gestational age of the baby and to \nrule out an ectopic pregnancy. The FDA also did not restrict the regimen to \nphysicians who have received proper training and possess admitting privileges to \nemergency facilities. In light of the FDA’s subsequent acknowledgment that women \nhad serious adverse events since the 2000 Approval, the 2002 Citizen Petition urged \nthe FDA to “react to these sentinel events because the clinical trials underlying the \napproval of the Mifeprex Regimen did not adhere to FDA’s endorsed scientific \nmethodology for such trials.”85 \n  What is more, the 2002 Petitioners challenged the 2000 Approval \nbecause the U.S. clinical trial for mifepristone did not mirror the anticipated \nconditions of use under the approved label despite the FFDCA’s requirements under \n21 U.S.C. § 355(d). Under the conditions of the U.S. clinical trial: \n(a) the investigators relied on transvaginal ultrasonography (along \nwith menstrual history and pelvic examination) to confirm the \ngestational age of each pregnancy and exclude women with ectopic \npregnancies;  \n(b) the physicians had experience in performing surgical abortions, \nwere trained in the administration of the mifepristone-misoprostol \nprocedure, and had admitting privileges at medical facilities that \ncould provide emergency care and hospitalization; and  \n \n85 Id. at 49–71. \n45 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 1   Filed 11/18/22    Page 46 of 113   PageID 46\n \n(c)  all patients needed to be within one hour of emergency facilities or \nthe facilities of the principal investigator; and \n(d) women were monitored for four hours for adverse events after \ntaking misoprostol.86 \n  Because the FDA’s 2000 Approval did not require these safeguards for \nwomen and girls using chemical abortion drugs, the 2002 Petitioners reasoned that \nthe agency should not have extrapolated conclusions about the safety and \neffectiveness of chemical abortion drugs under the approved label.87 \n  The 2002 Citizen Petition also requested that the FDA withdraw the \n2000 Approval of the chemical abortion drugs because the sponsor had not been \nenforcing the limited restrictions on the use of the drug regimen. Among the \ndeviations from the approved regimen, physicians were offering chemical abortion \ndrugs to women with pregnancies beyond the maximum seven weeks and \neliminating the second of the three prescribed visits (i.e., in-facility administration \nof misoprostol).88 \n  Subpart H authorizes the FDA to withdraw approval of a drug \napproved under Section 514.520 if “[t]he applicant fails to adhere to the \npostmarketing restrictions agreed upon.” 21 C.F.R. § 314.530(a)(4).

Implementation of a REMS for Mifepristone \n  After receiving the 2002 Citizen Petition, the FDA’s next significant \nregulatory action on chemical abortion drugs involved incorporating Congress’s \nmandate to convert Subpart H postmarketing restrictions for previously approved \ndrugs into a REMS. \n  As previously discussed, Section 909(b)(1) of the FDAAA specified that \na “drug that was approved before the effective date of this Act is . . . deemed to have \nin effect an approved [REMS] . . . if there are in effect on the effective date of this \nAct elements to assure safe use [pursuant to 21 C.F.R. § 514.520].” \n \n93 Id. at 86, n. 377. \n94 Ex. 26, 2003 Response. \n48 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 1   Filed 11/18/22    Page 49 of 113   PageID 49\n \n  In a March 27, 2008, Federal Register notice, the FDA identified \nchemical abortion drugs as one of “those drugs that FDA has determined will be \ndeemed to have in effect an approved REMS.”95 \n  In 2011, pursuant to the 2008 notice, the FDA approved a REMS for \nchemical abortion drugs in accordance with section 909(b)(1) of the FDAAA.96 \n  The FDA “determined that a REMS is necessary for MIFEPREX \n(mifepristone) to ensure the benefits of the drug outweigh the risks of serious \ncomplications.”97  \n   The REMS incorporated the previous Subpart H restrictions and \nconsisted of a Medication Guide, elements to assure safe use, an implementation \nsystem, and a timetable for submission of assessments of the REMS.98 \n  The REMS required “prescribers to certify that they are qualified to \nprescribe MIFEPREX (mifepristone) and are able to assure patient access to \nappropriate medical facilities to manage any complications.”99 \n  The FDA also instructed Danco that, “[a]s part of the approval under \nSubpart H, as required by 21 CFR § 314.550, you must submit all promotional \n \n95 Ex. 28, Identification of Drug and Biological Products Deemed to Have Risk \nEvaluation and Mitigation Strategies for Purposes of the Food and Drug \nAdministration Amendments Act of 2007, 73 Fed.

The FDA’s Denial of the 2002 Citizen Petition \n  Almost fourteen years after receiving the 2002 Citizen Petition—on \nMarch 29, 2016—the FDA denied the 2002 Citizen Petition (“2016 Denial”).101  \n  The FDA abused its regulatory authority under 21 C.F.R. \n§ 10.30(e)(2)(iv) to delay a final response to the 2002 Citizen Petition.  \n  In the 2016 Denial, the FDA asserted that it appropriately approved \nchemical abortion drugs under Subpart H because “[a]s FDA made clear in the \npreamble to the final rule for subpart H, the subpart H regulations are intended to \napply to serious or life-threatening conditions, as well as to illnesses or diseases.”102 \n  The FDA further asserted that the Subpart H premable “also made \nclear that a condition need not be serious or life-threatening in all populations or in \nall phases to fall within the scope of these regulations.”103 \n  The FDA asserted that “[u]nwanted pregnancy falls within the scope of \nsubpart H under § 314.500 because unwanted pregnancy, like a number of illnesses \n \n100 Ex. 29, 2011 Approval Letter at 2–3. \n101 Ex. 27, 2016 Petition Denial. \n102 Id. at 4 (emphasis added). \n103 Id. \n50 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 1   Filed 11/18/22    Page 51 of 113   PageID 51\n \nor conditions, can be serious for certain populations or under certain \ncircumstances.”104 \n  The FDA also asserted that chemical abortion “provides a meaningful \ntherapeutic benefit to some patients over surgical abortion” because chemical \nabortion “provides an alternative to surgical abortion,” which itself can lead to \ncomplications such as “a severe allergic reaction, a sudden drop in blood pressure \nwith cardiorespiratory arrest, death, and a longer recovery time following the \nprocedure.”105 \n  The FDA also asserted that the clinical trials constituted “substantial \nevidence” of effectiveness, while contending that the “FDA regulations do not \nrequire that a study be blinded, randomized, and/or concurrently controlled.”106 \n  The FDA then asserted that its decision not to require studies of \npediatric patients “was consistent with FDA’s implementation of the regulations in \neffect at that time.” The agency also asserted that its 2000 Approval “determined \nthat there were sufficient data from studies of mifepristone.” Even though the 2000 \nApproval said the FDA was waiving the requirement for a pediatric assessment, the \n2016 Petition Denial stated that the 2000 Approval “should have stated our \nconclusion that the pediatric study requirements were waived for pre-menarchal \npatients and that the pediatric study requirements were met for post-menarchal \n \n104 Id. \n105 Id. at 5. \n106 Id. at 9. \n51 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 1   Filed 11/18/22    Page 52 of 113   PageID 52\n \npediatric patients, rather than stating that we were waiving the requirements for \nall pediatric groups.”107 \n  In response to the 2002 Citizen Petition’s argument that the FDA’s \ninclusion of misoprostol as part of the mifepristone regimen was illegal because the \nsponsor of that drug had not submitted an sNDA, the FDA asserted that “[n]either \nthe FD&C Act nor FDA regulations require the submission of a supplemental NDA \nby the sponsor of the misoprostol NDA for the use of misoprostol as part of the \napproved treatment regimen for Mifeprex.”108 \n  The FDA provided “[e]xamples of approved drug labeling that refer to \nthe concomitant use of another drug without there being a specific reference to the \ncombined therapy in the previously approved labeling for the reference drug.”109 But \nthe FDA did not purport to provide an example of drug labeling where that second \ndrug was not approved for the use of the new indication. \nX.  The FDA’s 2016 Major Changes to the Mifepristone Regimen \n  On the same day that the FDA denied the 2002 Citizen Petition—\nMarch 29, 2016—the FDA also approved major changes to the mifepristone regimen \n(2016 Major Changes) in response to an sNDA that Danco had submitted to the \nFDA on May 28, 2015.110 \n \n107 Id. at 29. \n108 Id. at 15. \n109 Id. \n110 Ex. 31, 2016 FDA Letter to Danco Laboratories re: NDA 020687, Supp 20 (Mar. \n29, 2016). \n52 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 1   Filed 11/18/22    Page 53 of 113   PageID 53\n \n  The FDA acknowledged that the 2000 Approval hinged on necessary \nsafeguards to protect women and girls from the dangers of chemical abortion drugs. \nThe FDA’s “Summary Review” of the 2016 Major Changes recalled that “[a]t the \ntime of the September, 2000 approval, FDA restricted distribution of Mifeprex \nunder 21 CFR 314.520.” After summarizing the history and provisions of the REMS \nfor mifepristone, the FDA noted that “[t]he REMS for Mifeprex incorporated the \nrestrictions under which the drug was originally approved.”111 But the FDA decided \nto remove these crucial protections after reconsidering and reopening the 2000 \nApproval. \n  The FDA acknowledged that “these major changes are interrelated,” \ndemonstrating the agency’s awareness that each change impacted the others.112 \n  The 2016 Major Changes included the following revisions to the 2000 \nApproval’s safeguards for women and girls:  \n(a) extending the maximum gestational age at which a woman or a girl \ncan abort her baby from 49 days to 70 days; \n(b) altering the mifepristone dosage from 600 mg to 200 mg, the \nmisoprostol dosage from 400 mcg to 800 mcg, and misoprostol \nadministration from oral to buccal (cheek pouch);  \n \n111 Ex. 32, FDA, Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, Summary Review of \nApplication Number: 020687Orig1s020, at 4 (Mar. 29, 2016) (2016 Summary \nReview). \n112 Id. at 6. \n53 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 1   Filed 11/18/22    Page 54 of 113   PageID 54\n \n(c) eliminating the requirement that administration of misoprostol \noccur in-clinic;  \n(d) broadening the window for misoprostol administration to include a \nrange of 24-48 hours after taking mifepristone, instead of 48 hours \nafterwards; \n(e) adding a repeat 800 mcg buccal dose of misoprostol in the event of \nan incomplete chemical abortion; \n(f) removing the requirement for an in-person follow-up examination \nafter an abortion; and \n(g) allowing “healthcare providers” other than physicians to dispense \nand administer the chemical abortion drugs. 113 \n  Despite these major changes to the regimen, the FDA eliminated the \nrequirement for prescribers to report all nonfatal serious adverse events from \nchemical abortion drugs. Rather than require future adverse event reports from \nabortionists about whether revising the dosages and removing the initial safeguards \nharmed women and girls, the FDA simply asserted that “after 15 years of reporting \nserious adverse events, the safety profile for Mifeprex is essentially unchanged.” \nThe FDA at least conceded that “[i]t is important that the Agency be informed of \nany deaths with Mifeprex to monitor new safety signals or trends.”114  \n \n113 Id. at 6–10. \n114 Id. at 27. \n54 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 1   Filed 11/18/22    Page 55 of 113   PageID 55\n \n  As with the 2000 Approval, the 2016 Major Changes did not include \nprohibitions on the upstream distribution of chemical abortion drugs by mail, \nexpress company, or common carrier as proscribed by federal laws, nor did the FDA \nacknowledge and address these laws. \nA.  The FDA’s Evidence for the Safety and Effectiveness of the \n2016 Major Changes \n  The FDA lacked substantial evidence that the 2016 Major Changes \nwould have the effect it purported or was represented to have under the conditions \nof use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the proposed labeling thereof. \n  The FDA’s review and approval did not include a single adequate and \nwell-controlled investigation that evaluated the safety and effectiveness of \nmifepristone and misoprostol under the conditions prescribed, recommended, or \nsuggested in the proposed labeling thereof.  \n  Instead, the FDA relied on studies that evaluated only one or just a \nfew of the major changes that the FDA enacted in 2016; as the FDA acknowledged, \n“in some cases data from a given study were relied on to provide evidence to support \nmultiple changes”115—but no study supported all the changes. \n  For example, the FDA relied on a study lead by a former longtime \nemployee of the Population Council to support extending the maximum gestational \nage to 70 days, changing the dosing regimen, and authorizing a repeat dose of \n \n115 Ex. 32, 2016 Summary Review at 6. \n55 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 1   Filed 11/18/22    Page 56 of 113   PageID 56\n \nmisoprostol if the first dose fails.116 In this study, the abortionists (1) confirmed \ngestational age (and presumably screened for ectopic pregnancies) “based on routine \nultrasound practices,” (2) required the study participants to return to the study site \n7 to 14 days after using mifepristone “for clinical assessment, which included \nultrasonography,” and (3) “intervened surgically if they deemed it medically \nnecessary or at the patient’s request.”117 But the labeling that the FDA approved \nwith the 2016 Major Changes did not require (1) an ultrasound to confirm \ngestational age or screen for an ectopic pregnancy, (2) an in-person follow-up exam \nusing ultrasonography, and (3) an ability of abortionists to personally perform \nsurgical abortion if necessary. Such variations between the study conditions and the \napproved labeling fail to comply with the requirements of the FFDCA. \n  Moreover, the studies on which the FDA relied for each individual \nmajor change all contained at least one fatal flaw, including the following \nsubstantial weaknesses: significant loss to follow-up; safeguards not required under \nthe labeling; small sample size lacking statistical significance; not powered to \nevaluate safety; and bias.  \n  In fact, many of these studies showed that the new chemical abortion \nregimen was unsafe for use under the conditions prescribed, recommended, or \nsuggested in the proposed labeling thereof, or they failed to show that chemical \nabortion was safe under such conditions. \n \n116 Ex. 33, Beverly Winikoff et al., Extending Outpatient Medical Abortion Services \nThrough 70 Days of Gestational Age, 120 Obstetrics & Gynecology 1070 (2012). \n117 Id. at 1071. \n56 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 1   Filed 11/18/22    Page 57 of 113   PageID 57\n \nB.  The FDA’s Lack of Research on Pediatric Populations for the \n2016 Major Changes \n  The FDA’s 2016 Major Changes continued to allow pregnant girls of \nany age to use chemical abortion drugs—despite not knowing whether these \ndangerous drugs could have an adverse impact on the health, safety, and welfare of \ndeveloping girls. \n  The FDA did not require Danco to submit an assessment on the safety \nand effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric \nsubpopulations, nor did the FDA require Danco to submit an assessment that \nsupported the dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which \nthe drug is safe and effective.118  \n  The FDA “granted a partial PREA waiver for pre-menarcheal females \nages birth to 12 years because it would be impossible to conduct studies in this \npediatric population, as pregnancy does not exist in premenarchal females.” The \nFDA then concluded that Danco “fulfilled the remaining PREA requirement in \npostmenarcheal females by submitting published studies of Mifeprex for pregnancy \ntermination in postmenarcheal females less than 17 years old.” The FDA cited three \npublished studies in support of this conclusion.119 \n  The primary study on which the FDA relied, Efficacy and safety of \nmedical abortion using mifepristone and buccal misoprostol through 63 days, by \nMary Gatter and Deborah Nucatola of Planned Parenthood of Los Angeles and \n \n118 Ex. 32, 2016 Summary Review at 18–20. \n119 Id. at 18–19. \n57 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 1   Filed 11/18/22    Page 58 of 113   PageID 58\n \nKelly Cleland of Princeton University’s Office of Population Research, evaluated the \nproposed dosing regimen followed by home administration of misoprostol through \n63 days’ gestation. The study also included postmenarcheal girls in the study \npopulation, from which the FDA extrapolated its conclusion.120 \n  For the pediatric population under 18 years of age, the Planned \nParenthood study stated that it had a loss to follow-up of twenty percent (20%). \nTherefore, the authors lacked any knowledge of whether these girls died, were \nhospitalized, or experienced other serious adverse events.121 The authors also \nrecognized that “[l]oss to follow-up was significantly higher among the youngest age \ngroup.”122  \n  The FDA minimized this significant data gap by asserting that “loss to \nfollow-up was slightly higher in those less than 18 years old.”123 Despite this \nsignificant data gap, the FDA went on to conclude that “age did not adversely \nimpact efficacy outcomes.”124  \n  Furthermore, in this study, Planned Parenthood also performed an \nultrasound examination on all females prior to the chemical abortions, in addition \nto giving them “routine antibiotic coverage” at the beginning of the chemical \n \n120 Id. at 19 (citing Ex. 34, Mary Gatter et al., Efficacy and safety of medical \nabortion using mifepristone and buccal misoprostol through 63 days, 91 \nContraception 269 (2015). \n121 Ex. 34, Gatter at 4–5. \n122 Id.

Nor did the FDA address or \ndiscount any potential conflict of interest or bias in the study even though its \nauthors, Mary Gatter126 and Deborah Nucatola,127 had significant incentives to \nincrease their income and Planned Parenthood’s profits through abortion-related \nactions outside of performing surgical abortion.128 \n  A second study that the FDA cited in support of its PREA conclusion \nwas based on a nationwide registry of induced abortions and hospital register data \nin Finland.129 For the adolescent cohort who had chemical abortions, the study \n \n125 Ex. 34, Gatter at 2. \n126 See, e.g., The Center for Medical Progress, Second Planned Parenthood Senior \nExecutive Haggles Over Body Parts Prices, Changes Abortion Methods, YouTube \n(July 21, 2015), https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MjCs_gvImyw (video capturing \nGatter saying she “want[s] a Lamborghini” when discussing the price that she \nwould charge for selling intact aborted fetal body parts).  \n127 See, e.g., The Center for Medical Progress, Planned Parenthood Uses Partial-\nBirth Abortions to Sell Baby Parts, YouTube (July 14, 2015), \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjxwVuozMnU (video capturing Nucatola stating \nthat Planned Parenthood affiliates would be “happy” selling intact aborted fetal \nbody parts for a “reasonable” price that is “a little better than break even”).  \n128 The Fifth Circuit has recognized the overall authenticity and veracity of the \nundercover videos capturing Planned Parenthood’s desire to profit from the \ntrafficking of aborted fetal body parts.

In other words, the FDA should do no further \nharm to the few remaining safeguards for women and girls who undergo the \nchemical abortion drug regimen.138 \n  In particular, the 2019 Petitioners explained that eliminating or \nrelaxing the REMS to facilitate internet or telephone prescriptions would be \ndangerous to women and girls.139 The 2019 Citizen Petition also raised concerns \nabout dispensing from a pharmacy instead of a clinical facility.140 \n  The 2019 Citizen Petition provided the FDA with detailed analysis and \ndata to support these requests. \n \n137 Id. \n138 Id. at 14–25. \n139 Id. at 18–20. \n140 Id. at 20–23. \n63 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 1   Filed 11/18/22    Page 64 of 113   PageID 64\n \nXII.  The FDA’s Approval of a Generic Version of Mifeprex and a Single, \nShared System REMS \n  On April 11, 2019, the FDA approved GenBioPro, Inc.’s141 generic \nversion of Mifeprex, “Mifepristone Tablets, 200 mg” (2019 ANDA Approval). The \nFDA determined GenBioPro’s Mifepristone Tablets, 200 mg, “to be bioequivalent \nand, therefore, therapeutically equivalent to the reference listed drug (RLD), \nMifeprex Tablets, 200 mg, of Danco Laboratories, LLC.” GenBioPro’s generic \nversion of mifepristone has the same labeling and REMS as does Danco’s \nMifeprex.142 \n  On the same day, the FDA approved modifications to the existing \nREMS for chemical abortion drugs to establish a single, shared system REMS for \nmifepristone products for the “medical termination of intrauterine pregnancy,” thus \nallowing the FDA to have a uniform REMS for the chemical abortion drugs that two \ncompanies were now marketing.

Acting under new \nmanagement, the FDA responded to the 2020 ACOG-SMFM letter on April 12, \n2021, and stated that the agency “intends to exercise enforcement discretion” \nduring the COVID pandemic with respect to the in-person dispensing requirement \nof the REMS for mifepristone (2021 Non-Enforcement Decision).146 \n  The FDA’s 2021 Non-Enforcement Decision relied, in part, on the \nsupposed lack of reported adverse events caused by chemical abortion drugs \noccurring between January 2020 and January 2021—despite the agency’s \nelimination of non-fatal reporting requirements for abortionists in 2016. \nNevertheless, in 2021, the FDA still “found that the small number of adverse events \nreported to FDA during the COVID-19 public health emergency (PHE) provide no \nindication that any program deviation or noncompliance with the Mifepristone \nREMS Program contributed to the reported adverse events.”147  \n  The FDA’s 2021 Non-Enforcement Decision neither acknowledged nor \naddressed the federal laws expressly prohibiting the distribution of mifepristone by \nmail, express company, or common carrier—despite explicitly recognizing that this \naction would allow “dispensing of mifepristone through the mail . . . or through a \nmail-order pharmacy.”148 \n \n146 Ex. 39, 2021 FDA Letter to ACOG and SMFM About Mifepristone REMS, at 2 \n(Apr. 12, 2021) (2021 Non-Enforcement Decision). \n147 Id. \n148 Id. \n66 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 1   Filed 11/18/22    Page 67 of 113   PageID 67\n \nXV.  2021 “Minor” Changes \n  On May 14, 2021, the FDA approved “minor” changes to the Patient \nAgreement Form to use “gender neutral language,” replacing the pronouns “she” \nand “her” with “the patient.” The FDA made similar revisions to the REMS \ndocument to reflect the removal of the gender-specific pronouns in the Patient \nAgreement Form.149 \n  Despite these changes, the FDA did not require Danco to submit \nstudies showing the safety and effectiveness of chemical abortion on women and \ngirls who may be taking puberty blockers, testosterone injections, or other \nhormones in addition to the chemical abortion drugs. \n  Currently, the May 14, 2021, “minor” changes are the last updates to \nthe REMS for chemical abortion drugs that the FDA has approved.150 As discussed \nbelow, the FDA is requiring additional changes to the REMS. \nXVI.  The FDA’s December 2021 Announcement of Further Reductions in \nSafeguards \n  On December 16, 2021, Defendant Cavazonni, Director of the FDA’s \nCenter for Drug Evaluation and Research, wrote a letter to Graham Chelius, M.D., \nof the Society of Family Planning and the California Academy of Family Physicians \n \n149 Ex. 40, FDA Supplemental Approval Letter to Danco Laboratories, LLC (May 14, \n2021), https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/appletter/2021/020687Orig1\ns024ltr.pdf.  \n150 Ex. 41, 2021 Updated REMS for Mifepristone Tablets, 200mg (May 14, 2021), \nhttps://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/rems/index.cfm?event=RemsDetails.pag\ne&REMS=390. \n67 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 1   Filed 11/18/22    Page 68 of 113   PageID 68\n \nto inform him that the FDA had completed its review of the REMS for \nmifepristone.151 \n  Although the FDA “determined that the Mifepristone REMS Program \ncontinues to be necessary to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the \nrisks,” the agency “determined that it must be modified to minimize the burden on \nthe health care delivery system of complying with the REMS and to ensure that the \nbenefits of the drug outweigh the risks.”152 \n  The letter identified specific new modifications to the REMS: \n“(1) removing the requirement that mifepristone be dispensed only in certain \nhealthcare settings, specifically clinics, medical offices, and hospitals (i.e., the ‘in-\nperson dispensing requirement’); and (2) adding a requirement that pharmacies \nthat dispense the drug be specially certified,” signaling that the FDA will soon allow \npharmacies to dispense chemical abortion drugs.153 \n  Defendant Cavazzoni also noted that the FDA had answered the \n“related” 2019 Citizen Petition and would post the agency’s response in the public \ndocket.154 \nXVII. The FDA’s Denial and Granting of the 2019 Citizen Petition \n  Accordingly, on December 16, 2021—the same day that Defendant \nCavazzoni sent the letter to Dr. Chelius and over 2.5 years after receiving the 2019 \n \n151 Ex. 42, 2021 FDA Center for Drug Evaluation & Research Director Patrizia \nCavazzoni Letter to Dr. Graham Chelius (Dec. 16, 2021). \n152 Id. \n153 Id. \n154 Id. \n68 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 1   Filed 11/18/22    Page 69 of 113   PageID 69\n \nCitizen Petition—the FDA denied in part and granted in part the 2019 Citizen \nPetition (2021 FDA Response).155  \n  The FDA granted the 2019 Citizen Petition only to the extent that the \nagency agreed that a REMS is necessary to ensure that the “benefits” of \nmifepristone in a regimen with misoprostol outweigh the risks. But the FDA \nretained only the Prescriber Agreement Form and the Patient Agreement Form as \nthe remaining elements of the REMS.156 \n  Aside from retaining these two remaining requirements, the FDA \ndenied the 2019 Citizen Petition’s requests (1) to restore and strengthen the \nmifepristone and prescriber requirements approved in 2000 and (2) to continue \nlimiting the dispensing of mifepristone to women in clinics, medical offices, and \nhospitals, by or under the supervision of a certified prescriber.157 \n  Before addressing the merits of the 2019 Citizen Petition, the FDA \ndiscussed how chemical abortion drugs came to be regulated, starting with the 2000 \nApproval under Subpart H and the associated restrictions “needed to assure the \nsafe use of the drug product.” The FDA noted that it restricted the distribution of \nchemical abortion drugs under Subpart H, 21 C.F.R. § 314.520. The agency also \n \n155 Ex. 43, 2021 FDA Letter to AAPLOG and Am.

The agency also \ndisregarded the analyses and data set forth in the 2019 Citizen Petition. \n  The FDA repeated its previous justifications not to require studies in \nthe pertinent pediatric population in the underlying 2000 Approval and the 2016 \nMajor Changes, and it again asserted—without evidence—that “the safety and \nefficacy were expected to be the same for postpubertal (i.e., post-menarchal) \nadolescents.”159 \n  In response to the 2019 Citizen Petition’s request to preserve the few \nsafeguards after the 2016 Major Changes, the FDA stated that the REMS for \nmifepristone “must be modified to remove the requirement that mifepristone be \ndispensed only in certain healthcare settings, specifically clinics, medical offices, \nand hospitals, because this requirement is no longer necessary to ensure that the \nbenefits of the drug outweigh the risks.”160  \n  In support of its claim that in-person dispensing is unnecessary, the \nFDA relied on the “small” number of adverse events voluntarily reported in the \nFDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database to justify the elimination \n \n158 Id. at 2–3. \n159 Id. at 38. \n160 Id. at 25 \n70 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 1   Filed 11/18/22    Page 71 of 113   PageID 71\n \nof this safeguard, even though the FDA had years ago removed the requirement for \nabortionists to report nonfatal adverse events.161 \n  The FDA relied on the FAERS database despite conceding these facts: \n“FAERS data does have limitations”; the “FDA does not receive reports for every \nadverse event”; and thus “FAERS data cannot be used to calculate the incidence of \nan adverse event . . . in the U.S.”162 \n  The FDA likewise admitted that FAERS “is woefully inadequate to \ndetermine the post-marketing safety of mifepristone due to its inability to \nadequately assess the frequency or severity of adverse events” and the adverse \nevents reported to the FDA “represent a fraction of the actual adverse events \noccurring in American women.”163 The FDA also agreed that there are reporting \n“discrepancies [that] render the FAERS inadequate to evaluate the safety of \nmifepristone abortions.”164 \n  The complicated FAERS electronic submission process further hinders \nthe reporting of adverse events and exacerbates the unreliability of the number of \n \n161 Id. at 25–36. \n162 Ex. 44, Questions and Answers on FDA’s Adverse Event Reporting System \n(FAERS), https://www.fda.gov/drugs/surveillance/questions-and-answers-fdas-\nadverse-event-reporting-system-faers. \n163 Ex. 45, Kathi A.

The agency, however, noted that “the \nability to generalize the results of these studies to the United States population is \nhampered,” “the usefulness of the studies is limited in some instances by small \nsample sizes and lack of follow-up information on outcomes with regard to both \nsafety and efficacy,” and the FDA “did not find any large clinical studies that were \ndesigned to collect safety outcomes in healthcare systems similar to the United \nStates.”167  \n  Despite these limitations, the FDA concluded that mifepristone would \n“remain safe and efficacy [would] be maintained” if it removed the in-person \ndispensing requirement from the REMS program.168 \n \n165 Ex. 47, FDA, FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) Electronic \nSubmissions, https://www.fda.gov/drugs/questions-and-answers-fdas-adverse-event-\nreporting-system-faers/fda-adverse-event-reporting-system-faers-electronic-\nsubmissions.  \n166 Ex. 48, Specifications for Preparing and Submitting Electronic ICSRs and ICSR \nAttachments (April 2021), https://www.fda.gov/media/132096/download.  \n167 Ex. 43, 2021 FDA Response at 28. \n168 Id. \n72 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 1   Filed 11/18/22    Page 73 of 113   PageID 73\n \n  The FDA’s 2021 Petition Response neither acknowledged nor \naddressed the federal laws expressly prohibiting the distribution of mifepristone by \nmail, express company, or common carrier.  \n  In summary, the following chart illustrates the changes to the \nmifepristone regimen over the years: \nRegulation  2000 Approval  2016 Major  2021 Non-\nChanges  Enforcement \nDecision and \nPetition Denial \nMaximum Gestational  49 days  70 days  70 days \nAge \nDosage  •  600 mg of  •  200 mg of  •  200 mg of \nmifepristone  mifepristone  mifepristone \n•  400 mcg of  •  800 mcg of  •  800 mcg of \nmisoprostol  misoprostol  misoprostol \nRoute of misoprostol  Vaginal  Buccal  Buccal \nadministration \nTiming of misoprostol  48 hours after  24-48 hours after  24-48 hours after \nadministration  mifepristone  mifepristone  mifepristone \nRepeat dose of 800  No  Yes  Yes \nmcg misoprostol \nDispensed only by or       \nunder the supervision  Yes  No  No \nof a physician \nIn-person       \nadministration of  Yes  No  No \ndrug regimen \nIn-person dispensing  Yes  Yes  No \nof drug regimen \nFollow-up in-person       \nevaluation post- Yes  No  No \nabortion    \nRequiring prescribers  Yes  N o   N o \nto report all non-fatal \nserious adverse events \n \n73 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 1   Filed 11/18/22    Page 74 of 113   PageID 74\n \nXVIII.

As a result, women and girls often suffer \nunexpected episodes of heavy bleeding or severe pain and must rush to the \nemergency department of the nearest hospital.179 \n  As more women and girls require treatment in emergency \ndepartments, the other patients of the treating doctors are adversely affected. With \nthe increase in women and girls suffering emergency complications from chemical \nabortion or seeking to reverse the effects of the chemical abortion regimen, there is \na direct correlation in the decrease in time, attention, and resources that emergency \ndepartment doctors have to treat their other patients.180 \n \n178 Ex. 4, Harrison Decl. ¶ 19; Ex. 10, Foley Decl. ¶ 11. \n179 Ex. 8, Skop Decl. ¶¶ 13, 17–18, 22–23, 28–29; Ex. 5, Barrows Decl. ¶¶ 17–18; \nEx. 52, Jester Decl. ¶¶ 13, 15–16, 23; Ex. 10, Foley Decl. ¶ 9; Ex. 50, Frost-Clark \nDecl. ¶¶ 12–15. \n180 Ex. 9, Wozniak Decl. ¶¶ 17–18, 27; Ex. 7, Francis Decl. ¶ 12; Ex. 49, Johnson \nDecl. ¶¶ 14, 16; Ex. 8, Skop Decl. ¶ 32; Ex. 10, Foley Decl. ¶ 10; Ex. 51, Delgado \nDecl. ¶ 18; Ex. 3, Dickerson Decl. ¶ 14. \n77 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 1   Filed 11/18/22    Page 78 of 113   PageID 78\n \n  Abortionists commonly violate the remaining safeguards and the FDA-\napproved label for chemical abortion drugs by giving the drugs to women who are \ncontraindicated for chemical abortion (i.e., could experience deadly adverse events if \nthey take the drugs) and then subsequently harmed by these drugs, demonstrating \nthat the FDA’s remaining safeguards for women and girls are ineffective in \nprotecting them.181 \n  The FDA’s decision not to require abortionists to report all adverse \nevents for chemical abortion drugs harms women and girls because it creates an \ninaccurate and false safety profile for the use of chemical abortion drugs.182 \n  Due to inadequate adverse event reporting, the true rates of risks \nassociated with chemical abortion drugs remain undercounted and therefore are \nunknown. Because abortion providers cannot know the accurate risk levels that \ntheir patients face when ingesting these drugs, these providers cannot properly \ninform their patients about the risks associated with chemical abortion.

Therefore, women and girls are unable to \ngive informed consent to the drugs they are receiving, and thus they are not \nconsenting at all to taking the chemical abortion drugs—resulting in physical and \nmental injuries.185 \n  Women and girls often suffer distress and regret after undergoing \nchemical abortion, sometimes seeking to reverse the effects of mifepristone.186 \n  A woman or girl can experience these emotions and feelings upon \nviewing the body of her lifeless baby after taking chemical abortion drugs.187 \n  Even with medical oversight, abortionists can sometimes coerce women \ninto taking chemical abortion drugs—without their true informed consent.188 \n  The FDA’s actions to eliminate in-person dispensing and \nadministration also harm women because the lack of oversight will likely \nexacerbate human trafficking. Many trafficked women experience abortions and \ndoctors potentially serve as an important resource to intervene on behalf of these \ntrafficked women and girls.189 \n \n185 Ex. 4, Harrison Decl. ¶ 37; Ex. 8, Skop Decl. ¶¶ 14, 16, 27; Ex. 49, Johnson \nDecl. ¶ 12; Ex. 10, Foley Decl. ¶ 15; Ex. 50, Frost-Clark Decl. ¶ 20; Ex. 51, Delgado \nDecl. ¶ 15. \n186 Ex. 8, Skop Decl. ¶¶ 15–16; Ex. 10, Foley Decl. ¶¶ 12, 16; Ex. 51, Delgado \nDecl. ¶ 14. \n187 Ex. 8, Skop Decl. ¶ 15. \n188 Ex. 51, Delgado Decl. ¶ 15. \n189 Ex. 8, Skop Decl. ¶ 31. \n79 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 1   Filed 11/18/22    Page 80 of 113   PageID 80\n \n  Women and girls will continue to suffer complications from chemical \nabortion drugs.190 \nB.

This is especially true in maternity care “deserts” (i.e., geographic areas \nwhere there are not a large number of OB/Gyn providers for patients).198 \n  When there is a complication from chemical abortion drugs, the typical \ncare doctors provide patients moves from simple patient management to \ncomplicated patient management. Accordingly, a patient who suffers complications \nfrom chemical abortion drugs requires significantly more time and attention from \nproviders than most patients require.199 \n  For example, Plaintiff Dr. Jester needed to treat a woman who had \ntraveled from Texas to New Mexico to obtain chemical abortion drugs from Planned \nParenthood. The woman returned to Texas, suffered from two weeks of moderate to \nheavy bleeding, and then developed a uterine infection.

The woman consumed the first chemical abortion drug, \nmifepristone, at Planned Parenthood and took an Uber for a ride home. During her \nUber ride, she began to experience bleeding and other adverse side effects from the \nmifepristone. Instead of taking her home, the Uber driver took her to the emergency \ndepartment of Dr. Wozniak’s hospital. Dr. Wozniak treated the woman and advised \nher not to take the second chemical abortion drug, misoprostol, because of the grave \nrisk that she could bleed out and die.201 \n  The FDA’s elimination of the in-person dispensing requirement for \nchemical abortion drugs—allowing mail-order abortion—further harms the practice \nof medicine. The increasing number of chemical abortions through mail-order or \ntelemedicine methods means that more women and girls will suffer complications \nand require medical attention from doctors, including Plaintiff doctors and the \n \n200 Ex. 52, Jester Decl. ¶ 17. \n201 Ex. 9, Wozniak Decl. ¶¶ 24–25. \n83 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 1   Filed 11/18/22    Page 84 of 113   PageID 84\n \nmembers of Plaintiff medical associations, especially given that remote abortionists \noften cannot or do not treat such complications.202 \n  To circumvent state laws that regulate abortions and protect the \nhealth and safety of women and girls, abortionists are relying on access to chemical \nabortion drugs through mail-order schemes or telemedicine, further increasing the \nuse of these drugs and the complications associated with them.203 \n  As more emergency situations arise, emergency room doctors, such as \nPlaintiff doctors and the members of Plaintiff medical associations, are having to \ntreat more patients, including performing hysterectomies or removing fetal parts \nremains. The more patients suffering emergency complications from chemical \nabortion or seeking to reverse the chemical abortion process, the less time and \nattention these doctors have to treat their other patients.204 \n  Because abortionists do not adequately describe what happens during \na chemical abortion and give these drugs to women and girls to take outside of the \nabortion facility, doctors have needed to treat and care for many women who have \ncome to the emergency department for their intense bleeding and other effects of \n \n202 Ex. 9, Wozniak Decl. ¶ 14; Ex. 5, Barrows Decl. ¶ 17; Ex. 52, Jester Decl. ¶¶ 22–\n23; Ex. 50, Frost-Clark Decl. ¶ 12–15; Ex. 10, Foley Decl. ¶ 10. \n203 Ex. 9, Wozniak Decl. ¶ 13; Ex. 10, Foley Decl. ¶ 10; see also Ruth Reader, State \nabortion bans prove easy to evade, Politico (Nov. 11, 2022, 2:24 PM), \nhttps://www.politico.com/news/2022/11/01/state-abortion-bans-medication-\n00064407; Emily Bazelon, Risking Everything to Offer Abortions Across State Lines, \nNew York Times (Oct. 4, 2022), https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/04/magazine/\nabortion-interstate-travel-post-roe.html.  \n204 Ex. 9, Wozniak Decl. ¶¶ 17–18, 27; Ex. 7, Francis Decl. ¶ 14; Ex. 49, Johnson \nDecl. ¶¶ 14, 16; Ex. 8, Skop Decl. ¶ 32; Ex. 51, Delgado Decl. ¶ 18. \n84 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 1   Filed 11/18/22    Page 85 of 113   PageID 85\n \nthe chemical abortion drugs—although not considered complications from the \nregimen.205 \n  Doctors, including Plaintiff doctors and the members of Plaintiff \nmedical associations, experience enormous pressure, stress, and chaos in these \nemergency situations that the FDA created through its approval of chemical \nabortion drugs and elimination of necessary safeguards.206 \n  Some of these emergency situations force pro-life doctors, including \nPlaintiff doctors and the members of Plaintiff medical associations, into situations \nin which they feel complicit in an elective chemical abortion by needing to remove a \nbaby with a beating heart or pregnancy tissue as the only means to save the life of \nthe woman or girl. This feeling of complicity in the act of an elective chemical \nabortion causes great emotional suffering, mental anguish, and spiritual distress \namong these doctors.207 \n  For example, Dr. Ingrid Skop, a member of Plaintiff AAPLOG, needed \nto treat a young woman who had been bleeding for six weeks after she took \nchemical abortion drugs at a Planned Parenthood facility. After two follow-up \nappointments, Planned Parenthood had given her an additional dose of the second \nchemical abortion drug, misoprostol, which failed to resolve her complications. \nWhen Dr. Skop treated the young woman, Dr. Skop performed a sonogram, \n \n205 Ex. 10, Foley Decl. ¶ 15; Ex. 49, Johnson Decl. ¶ 11. \n206 Ex. 9, Wozniak Decl. ¶ 17; Ex. 5, Barrows Decl. ¶ 19; Ex. 52, Jester ¶ 20; Ex. 49, \nJohnson ¶ 15; Ex. 3, Dickerson Decl. ¶ 14. \n207 Ex. 8, Skop Decl. ¶ 34; Ex. 7, Francis Decl. ¶ 13; Ex. 5, Barrows Decl. ¶ 26; Ex. 3, \nDickerson Decl. ¶ 16. \n85 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 1   Filed 11/18/22    Page 86 of 113   PageID 86\n \nidentified a significant amount of pregnancy tissue remaining in the woman’s \nuterus, and had to perform a suction aspiration to resolve her complication.208 \n  The members of Plaintiff medical associations oppose being forced to \nend the life of a human being in the womb for no medical reason, including by \nhaving to complete an incomplete elective chemical abortion. The objections are \nboth ethical and medical as they stem from the purpose of medicine itself, which is \nto heal and not to electively kill human beings regardless of their location. \nAccordingly, Plaintiff medical associations and their members are harmed by the \nFDA’s repeated removal of necessary safeguards, which may force them to treat \nwomen and girls seeking the completion of an elective chemical abortion. This \nconcern is real and imminent, especially in light of the Biden HHS’s impermissible \nactions to compel doctors to complete elective chemical abortions under the \nEmergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA).209 \n  The FDA’s loosening of chemical abortion regulations impacts the \nstandard of care for chemical abortion drugs and the demands and expectations \nthat hospitals will put on their physicians.210 \n \n208 Ex. 8, Skop Decl. ¶ 23. \n209 Ex. 4, Harrison Decl. ¶ 44; Ex. 5, Barrows Decl. ¶ 26; Ex. 3, Dickerson Decl. ¶ 16; \nsee also Reinforcement of EMTALA Obligations specific to Patients who are \nPregnant or are Experiencing Pregnancy Loss (QSO-21-22-Hospitals- UPDATED \nJULY 2022), https://www.cms.gov/files/document/qso-22-22-hospitals.pdf. \n210 Ex. 5, Barrows Decl. ¶ 25. \n86 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 1   Filed 11/18/22    Page 87 of 113   PageID 87\n \n  It grieves Plaintiff doctors and members of Plaintiff medical \nassociations to treat women and girls harmed by chemical abortion drugs, including \nthose who regret their decision to have a chemical abortion.211 \n  When their patients have chemical abortions, doctors lose the \nopportunity to provide professional services and care for the woman and child \nthrough pregnancy, which causes harms to providers who no longer can care for \ntheir patients and bring about a successful delivery of a new life.212 \n  The FDA’s elimination of the requirement for abortionists to report all \nadverse events related to chemical abortion drugs leads to unreliable reporting. \nWithout an accurate understanding of the adverse effects of widespread chemical \nabortion drug use, Plaintiff doctors and members of Plaintiff medical associations \ncannot effectively practice evidence-based medicine. Health care providers cannot \nassess the risks of a particular course of treatment if the FDA is not collecting and \ntracking the risks. And, therefore, they cannot accurately advise their patients and \nthe public about these risks.213 \n  Many doctors likely do not know about the importance of reporting \nadverse events related to chemical abortion drugs to the FDA.

The adverse event reporting requirements \nand the FAERS submission process harm medical practices by taking away \nsignificant time from a doctor to treat and meet with patients.215 \n  In addition, even when doctors want to voluntarily report adverse \nevents to the manufacturer, Danco, the doctor must print, fill out by hand, and then \neither mail or email back the form to Danco. Much of the information required by \nthis form is impossible to obtain by the physician seeing the patient if they were not \nthe one who dispensed the medication (such as lot number and dosage)—forcing the \ndoctor to leave several fields blank. There is no confirmation whether the reported \ncomplications were recorded by Danco or reported to the FDA. Regardless, this \nsubmission process harms medical practices by taking away significant time from a \ndoctor to treat and meet with patients.216 \n  Even when doctors want to report adverse events to their state \nregulators, their reports can be rejected for improper reasons (e.g., asserting that \nthere was no adverse event because the doctor saved and treated the woman injured \nby chemical abortion drugs).217 \n \n215 Ex. 7, Francis Decl. ¶¶ 16–18; Ex. 4, Harrison Decl. ¶ 33–34; Ex. 50, Frost-Clark \nDecl. ¶ 23. \n216 Ex. 7, Francis Decl. ¶¶ 16–18. \n217 Ex. 9, Wozniak Decl. ¶ 26. \n88 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 1   Filed 11/18/22    Page 89 of 113   PageID 89\n \n  Because many women and girls suffering complications from chemical \nabortion drugs tell emergency department doctors that they are experiencing \nmiscarriages, these doctors might not report these incidences as adverse events and \nso these complications are significantly underreported or not fully known.218 \n  The inability or refusal of a patient to disclose why she is presenting \nherself in the emergency department or what drugs she has received also impedes \nthe ability of doctors, including Plaintiff doctors and the members of Plaintiff \nmedical associations, to practice medicine and provide proper treatment to these \npatients.219 \n  The lack of accurate information on adverse events also harms the \ndoctor-patient relationship with all medical care providers because the patients no \nlonger trust that their health care providers are telling them the truth.

They provide care to all women and unborn \nchildren, and they give them the best professional services possible.

The Need for Judicial Relief \n  Injunctive relief is necessary to prevent these harms, and judicial relief \nis appropriate to vacate, set aside, enjoin, and declare these acts unlawful.  \n  All of the agency actions at issue—the 2000 Approval, the 2016 \nPetition Denial, the 2016 Major Changes, the 2019 ANDA Approval, the 2021 Non-\nEnforcement Decision, and the 2021 Petition Response, as well as the agency’s \nfailure to act and prohibit or restrict chemical abortion drugs—are final agency \nactions subject to judicial review under the APA.  \n  All the acts of Defendants described above, and their officers, agents, \nemployees, and servants, were executed and are continuing to be executed by \nDefendants under the color and pretense of the policies, statutes, ordinances, \nregulations, customs, and usages of the United States.  \n  Under 5 U.S.C. § 701(a), no statute precludes judicial review of the \nagency’s actions, and the actions are not committed to agency discretion by law.  \n  Under the APA, a reviewing court must “hold unlawful and set aside \nagency action, findings, and conclusions” if they are “in excess of statutory \njurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right.” 5 U.S.C. \n§ 706(2)(C). \n \n230 Ex. 4, Harrison Decl. ¶ 43; Ex. 7, Francis Decl. ¶ 24; Ex. 5, Barrows Decl. ¶ 27; \nEx. 6, Van Meter Decl. ¶ 22; Ex. 3, Dickerson Decl. ¶ 20. \n93 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 1   Filed 11/18/22    Page 94 of 113   PageID 94\n \n  Under the APA, a reviewing court must “hold unlawful and set aside \nagency action, findings, and conclusions” if they are “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse \nof discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \n  Likewise, a court must “compel agency action unlawfully withheld.” \n5 U.S.C. § 706(1). \n  Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy available at law.  \n  Plaintiffs have no adequate or available administrative remedy. In the \nalternative, any administrative remedy would be futile or unnecessary.  \n  Defendants would suffer no harm from the relief requested, and the \nrelief requested would serve the public interest.  \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nCLAIM ONE \n2000 APPROVAL \nADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT (5 U.S.C. § 706) \nIN EXCESS OF STATUTORY JURISDICTION, AUTHORITY, OR \nLIMITATIONS, OR SHORT OF STATUTORY RIGHT; \nARBITRARY, CAPRICIOUS, AN ABUSE OF DISCRETION, OR \nOTHERWISE NOT IN ACCORDANCE WITH LAW \n \n  Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate, as though fully set forth, \nparagraphs 1–330 of this complaint. \n  Defendants lacked legal authority in 2000 to approve mifepristone \nunder the FDA’s Subpart H regulations. \nI.  Subpart H \n  The FDA’s Subpart H regulations apply only to “certain new drugs \nthat have been studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-\n94 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 1   Filed 11/18/22    Page 95 of 113   PageID 95\n \nthreatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit to patients \nover existing treatments (e.g., ability to treat patients unresponsive to, or intolerant \nof, available therapy, or improved patient response over available therapy).” 21 \nC.F.R. § 314.500. \n  Pregnancy is not an illness. \n  Pregnancy is neither “serious” nor “life-threatening,” as those terms \nare understood in Subpart H.  \n  Chemical abortion does not provide a “meaningful therapeutic benefit \nto patients over existing treatments.” \n  Defendants lacked the authority to approve mifepristone for chemical \nabortion under Subpart H in 2000.  \n  Because the French and American trials did not compare the Mifeprex \nregimen with the then-existing method for ending pregnancies (i.e., surgical \nabortion), the trials did not demonstrate a “meaningful therapeutic benefit over \nexisting therapy.” \n  Thus, the FDA’s 2000 Approval of mifepristone for chemical abortion \nwas arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, and otherwise not in accordance \nwith Subpart H’s provision for the accelerated approval of certain new drugs. \nII.  FFDCA \n  Defendants lacked legal authority in 2000 to approve mifepristone \nunder the FFDCA. \n  The FDA’s 2000 Approval violated the FFDCA because the clinical \ntrials on which the agency relied did not use the full set of design features the \n95 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 1   Filed 11/18/22    Page 96 of 113   PageID 96\n \nagency typically requires to produce unbiased investigations of drug safety and \neffectiveness. \n  Because these trials were not blinded, randomized, or concurrently \ncontrolled, they did not establish the safety and effectiveness of the Mifeprex \nregimen. \n  The FDA also failed to perform a statistical analysis of the data from \nthe U.S. Clinical Trial. \n  The FDA impermissibly extrapolated conclusions about the safety and \neffectiveness of mifepristone from the U.S. Clinical Trial even though the agency did \nnot retain the requirements governing physician training, ultrasound, the post-\nmisoprostol waiting period, or physician privileges at facilities that provide \nemergency care. The U.S. Clinical Trial failed to meet the requirements of the \nFFDCA that the trial demonstrates safety and effectiveness under the conditions of \nuse prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the labeling or proposed labeling \nthereof. Instead, the FDA had insufficient information on whether mifepristone was \nsafe under such conditions. \n  Finally, the FDA violated the FFDCA and the agency’s implementing \nregulations because the agency mandated the use of misoprostol for chemical \nabortion as part of the 2000 Approval—despite the requirement that the sponsor \nsubmit an sNDA for a new use of a previously approved drug. \n  Therefore, Defendants lacked the authority to approve mifepristone for \nchemical abortion under the FFDCA. Given these infirmities, the 2000 Approval \n96 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 1   Filed 11/18/22    Page 97 of 113   PageID 97\n \nwas arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, and otherwise not in accordance \nwith the FFDCA. \nIII.  PREA \n  Defendants lacked legal authority in 2000 to approve mifepristone \nunder PREA. \n  In the 2000 Approval, the FDA stated that it was “waiving the \npediatric study requirement for this action on this application.”231 \n  Because the 2000 Approval failed to meet any of the qualifications for a \nwaiver, see 21 U.S.C. § 355c(a)(5)(A), (B), the FDA lacked authority when waiving \nthe pediatric study requirement without explanation, and the 2000 Approval was in \nexcess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right \nwhen the FDA waived the pediatric study requirement without explanation. For the \nsame reason, the 2000 Approval was arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or \notherwise not in accordance with law when the FDA waived the pediatric study \nrequirement without explanation. \n  In 2016, despite contrary evidence in the administrative record, the \nFDA sought to provide an impermissible post-hoc rationalization that it \ninaccurately stated in the 2000 Approval that it was “waiving” the pediatric study \nrequirements and, instead, should have said it had found that the requirements \n \n231 Ex. 25, 2000 Approval Letter at 3. \n97 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 1   Filed 11/18/22    Page 98 of 113   PageID 98\n \nwere met for post-menarchal pediatric patients by extrapolating from studies of \nadult populations.232 \n  In addition to such a post-hoc rationalization being impermissible and \nan inaccurate representation of the agency’s decision-making at the time, the FDA \nlacked authority under PREA. The 2000 Approval was in excess of statutory \njurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right, and the 2000 \nApproval was arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in \naccordance with law. Because the agency was allowed to extrapolate from studies of \nadult populations only if the course of a “disease” is substantially similar in adults \nand the pediatric population. Because pregnancy is not a disease, PREA did not \npermit the FDA to make such an extrapolation. \n  In addition to such a rationalization being impermissible and an \ninaccurate representation of the agency’s decision-making at the time, the FDA \nlacked authority under PREA. The 2000 Approval was in excess of statutory \njurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right, and the 2000 \nApproval was arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in \naccordance with law because the FDA failed to satisfy the requirement for \ndocumentation of the scientific data that supports its extrapolation that the course \nof the “disease” and the effects of the drug are sufficiently similar in adult women \nand pediatric girls. \n \n232 Ex. 27, 2016 Petition Denial at 29. \n98 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 1   Filed 11/18/22    Page 99 of 113   PageID 99\n \n  In addition to such a rationalization being impermissible and an \ninaccurate representation of the agency’s decision-making at the time, the FDA \nlacked authority under PREA, the 2000 Approval was in excess of statutory \njurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right, and the 2000 \nApproval was arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, and not in accordance \nwith law because PREA allows the agency to extrapolate from adequate and well-\ncontrolled studies in adults and, as discussed above, the U.S. Clinical Trial did not \ninclude adequate and well-controlled studies in adults. \n  In addition to such a rationalization being impermissible and an \ninaccurate representation of the agency’s decision-making at the time, the 2000 \nApproval was arbitrary, capricious, and an abuse of discretion because the FDA’s \nexplanation that it expected girls—under the age of 18 years and going through \nreproductive development—to have the same physiological outcome with the drug \nregimen as adult women was unreasonable and not supported by the administrative \nrecord. \n  In addition to such a rationalization being impermissible and an \ninaccurate representation of the agency’s decision-making at the time, the 2000 \nApproval was arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in \naccordance with law because the FDA did not require an assessment that evaluated \nthe safety and effectiveness of the drug for girls under 18 years of age. \n99 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 1   Filed 11/18/22    Page 100 of 113   PageID 100\n \n  Therefore, Defendants lacked the authority to approve mifepristone for \nchemical abortion under PREA, and the 2000 Approval was arbitrary, capricious, an \nabuse of discretion, and otherwise not in accordance with PREA. \nIV.  Pretext \n  The FDA’s illegal and unreasonable rationales for the 2000 Approval—\nin light of the political context of the agency’s actions—indicate that the stated \nreasons for the 2000 Approval are pretext. Therefore, the FDA’s 2000 Approval is \narbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, and otherwise not in accordance with \nlaw in violation of the APA. 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \nV.

When issuing these \ndecisions, the FDA undertook a serious, substantive reconsideration of the \nsafeguards enshrined in the 2000 Approval decision. Ultimately, by removing the \nsafeguards in the 2000 Approval, the FDA created a different regulatory construct \nand completely changed the regulatory context for the chemical abortion drug \nregimen. \n  Therefore, the FDA’s 2016 Petition Denial must be held unlawful, set \naside, and preliminarily and permanently enjoined under the APA. \n102 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 1   Filed 11/18/22    Page 103 of 113   PageID 103\n \nCLAIM THREE \n2016 MAJOR CHANGES \nADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT (5 U.S.C. § 706) \nIN EXCESS OF STATUTORY JURISDICTION, AUTHORITY, OR \nLIMITATIONS, OR SHORT OF STATUTORY RIGHT;  \nARBITRARY, CAPRICIOUS, AN ABUSE OF DISCRETION, OR \nOTHERWISE NOT IN ACCORDANCE WITH LAW \n \n  Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate, as though fully set forth, \nparagraphs 1–330 of this complaint.  \n  Defendants lacked legal authority to make the 2016 Major Changes. \nI.  FFDCA \n  The FDA’s 2016 Major Changes violated the FFDCA because they did \nnot include adequate tests by all methods reasonably applicable to show whether or \nnot such drug is safe for use under the conditions prescribed, recommended, or \nsuggested in the proposed labeling thereof. \n  The 2016 Major Changes violated the FFDCA because the results of \nthe tests on which the FDA relied for its 2016 Major Changes showed that chemical \nabortion is unsafe for use under such conditions, or they did not show that such \ndrug is safe for use under the conditions prescribed, recommended, or suggested in \nthe proposed labeling thereof. \n  The 2016 Major Changes violated the FFDCA because the FDA had \ninsufficient information to determine whether mifepristone is safe for use under the \nconditions prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the proposed labeling thereof. \n  The FDA’s 2016 Major Changes lacked substantial evidence that the \nnew drug will have the effect it purports or is represented to have under the \n103 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 1   Filed 11/18/22    Page 104 of 113   PageID 104\n \nconditions of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the proposed labeling \nthereof. \n  In violation of the FFDCA, none of the studies on which the FDA relied \nfor its 2016 Major Changes evaluated the safety and effectiveness of the chemical \nabortion regimen under the conditions of the label approved in 2016, or they failed \nto satisfy the substantial evidence requirement for showing the safety and \neffectiveness of the regimen under the conditions of the label approved in 2016. \n  Therefore, Defendants lacked legal authority to make the 2016 Major \nChanges. The FDA’s 2016 Major Changes were in excess of statutory jurisdiction, \nauthority, or limitations, or short of statutory right under the FFDCA. The FDA’s \n2016 Major Changes were unreasonable and not supported by the administrative \nrecord. \nII.  PREA \n  The FDA lacked legal authority under PREA to make the 2016 Major \nChanges, and the 2016 Major Changes were in excess of statutory jurisdiction, \nauthority, or limitations, or short of statutory right, and were arbitrary, capricious, \nan abuse of discretion, and not in accordance with law, because PREA allows the \nFDA to extrapolate from studies of adult populations only if the course of a “disease” \nis substantially similar in adults and the pediatric population. Because pregnancy \nis not a disease, PREA did not permit the FDA to make such an extrapolation. \n  Defendants lacked legal authority under PREA to make the 2016 \nMajor Changes and the 2016 Major Changes were in excess of statutory jurisdiction, \nauthority, or limitations, or short of statutory right, and were arbitrary, capricious, \n104 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 1   Filed 11/18/22    Page 105 of 113   PageID 105\n \nan abuse of discretion, and not in accordance with law, because the FDA failed to \nsatisfy the requirement for documentation of the scientific data that supports its \nextrapolation that the course of the “disease” and the effects of the drug are \nsufficiently similar in adult women and pediatric girls. \n  Defendants lacked legal authority under PREA to make the 2016 \nMajor Changes and the 2016 Major Changes were in excess of statutory jurisdiction, \nauthority, or limitations, or short of statutory right, and were arbitrary, capricious, \nan abuse of discretion, and not in accordance with law, because the FDA did not \nrequire an assessment that evaluated the safety and effectiveness of mifepristone \nfor girls under 18 years of age. \nIII.  Pretext \n  The FDA’s illegal and unreasonable rationales for the 2016 Major \nChanges—in light of the political context of the agency’s actions—indicate that the \nstated reasons for the 2016 Major Changes are pretext.

The Court GRANTS the Motion IN PART.  \nBACKGROUND \nOver twenty years ago, the United States Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) approved \nchemical abortion (“2000 Approval”). The legality of the 2000 Approval is now before this Court.    \nWhy did it take two decades for judicial review in federal court? After all, Plaintiffs’ petitions \nchallenging the 2000 Approval date back to the year 2002, right?  \nSimply put, FDA stonewalled judicial review — until now. Before Plaintiffs filed this case, \nFDA ignored their petitions for over sixteen years, even though the law requires an agency response \nwithin “180 days of receipt of the petition.” 21 C.F.R. § 10.30(e)(2)). But FDA waited 4,971 days \nto adjudicate Plaintiffs’ first petition and 994 days to adjudicate the second. See ECF Nos. 1-14, \n1-28,  1-36,  1-44  (“2002  Petition,”  “2019  Petition,”  respectively).  Had  FDA  responded  to \nPlaintiffs’ petitions within the 360 total days allotted, this case would have been in federal court \ndecades earlier. Instead, FDA postponed and procrastinated for nearly 6,000 days.  \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 137   Filed 04/07/23    Page 2 of 67   PageID 4424\nPlaintiffs are doctors and national medical associations that provide healthcare for pregnant and \npost-abortive women and girls. Plaintiffs sued Defendants to challenge multiple administrative actions \nculminating in the 2000 Approval of the chemical abortion regimen for mifepristone. ECF No. 1 at 2. \nMifepristone — also known as RU-486 or Mifeprex — is a synthetic steroid that blocks the hormone \nprogesterone, halts nutrition, and ultimately starves the unborn human until death. ECF No. 7 at 7–8.1 \nBecause mifepristone alone will not always complete the abortion, FDA mandates a two-step drug \nregimen: mifepristone to kill the unborn human, followed by misoprostol to induce cramping and \ncontractions to expel the unborn human from the mother’s womb. Id. at 8.   \nIn 1996, the Population Council2 filed a new drug application (“NDA”) with FDA for \nmifepristone. ECF No. 1 at 35. Shortly thereafter, FDA reset the NDA from “standard” to “priority \nreview.” Id. In February 2000, FDA wrote a letter to the Population Council stating that “adequate \ninformation ha[d] not been presented to demonstrate that the drug, when marketed in accordance \nwith the terms of distribution proposed, is safe and effective for use as recommended.” ECF No. \n1-24 at 6 (emphasis added). FDA also noted the “restrictions on distribution will need to be \namended.” Id. \n \n \n1 Jurists often use the word “fetus” to inaccurately identify unborn humans in unscientific ways. The word “fetus” \nrefers to a specific gestational stage of development, as opposed to the zygote, blastocyst, or embryo stages. \nSee ROBERT P. GEORGE & CHRISTOPHER TOLLEFSEN, EMBRYO 27–56 (2008) (explaining the gestational stages of an \nunborn human). Because other jurists use the terms “unborn human” or “unborn child” interchangeably, and because \nboth terms are inclusive of the multiple gestational stages relevant to the FDA Approval, 2016 Changes, and 2021 \nChanges, this Court uses “unborn human” or “unborn child” terminology throughout this Order, as appropriate. \n \n2 The Population Council was founded by John D. Rockefeller in 1952 after he convened a conference with \n“population activists” such as Planned Parenthood’s director and several well-known eugenicists. \nMATTHEW CONNELLY, FATAL MISCONCEPTION: THE STRUGGLE TO CONTROL WORLD POPULATION 156 (2008). \nThe conference attendees discussed “the problem of ‘quality.’” John D. Rockefeller, On the Origins of the \nPopulation Council, 3 POPULATION AND DEV. REV. 493, 496 (1977). They concluded that “[m]odern civilization had \nreduced the operation of natural selection by saving more ‘weak’ lives and enabling them to reproduce,” thereby \nresulting in “a downward trend in . . . genetic quality.” Id.  \n2 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 137   Filed 04/07/23    Page 3 of 67   PageID 4425\nMere months later, FDA approved the chemical abortion regimen under Subpart H, commonly \nknown as “accelerated approval” and originally designed to expedite investigational HIV medications \nduring the AIDS epidemic.3 Subpart H accelerates approval of drugs “that have been studied for their \nsafety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful \ntherapeutic benefit to patients over existing treatments (e.g., ability to treat patients unresponsive to, or \nintolerant of, available therapy, or improved patient response over available therapy).” 21 C.F.R. \n§ 314.500.  \nFDA then imposed post-approval restrictions “to assure safe use.” See 21 C.F.R. § 314.520. \nThese restrictions were later adopted when Subpart H was codified as a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation \nStrategy (“REMS”) “to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the risks.” 21 U.S.C. § 355-1(a)(1)–\n(2). The drugs were limited to women and girls with unborn children aged seven-weeks gestation \nor younger. ECF No. 7 at 9. FDA also required three (3) in-person office visits: the first to \nadminister  mifepristone,  the  second  to  administer  misoprostol,  and  the  third  to  assess  any \ncomplications and ensure there were no fetal remains in the womb. Id. Additionally, abortionists \nwere required to be properly trained to administer the regimen and to report all adverse events \nfrom the drugs. Id. \nPlaintiffs American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians & Gynecologists (“AAPLOG”) \nand Christian Medical & Dental Associations filed the 2002 Petition with FDA challenging the \n2000 Approval. Id. In 2006, the U.S. House Subcommittee on Criminal Justice, Drug Policy, and \nHuman Resources expressed the same concerns and held a hearing to investigate FDA’s handling \n \n3 See, e.g., Jessica Holden Kloda & Shahza Somerville, FDA’s Expedited Review Process: The Need for Speed, 35 \nAPPLIED CLINICAL TRIALS 17, 17–18 (2015) (“In 1992, in response to a push by AIDS advocates to make the \ninvestigational anti-AIDS drug azidothymidine (AZT) accessible, the FDA enacted ‘Subpart H’ commonly referred \nto as accelerated approval; giving rise to expedited review of drugs by the FDA.”). \n3 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 137   Filed 04/07/23    Page 4 of 67   PageID 4426\nof mifepristone and its subsequent monitoring of the drug.4 Then-Chairman Souder remarked that \nmifepristone was “associated with the deaths of at least 8 women, 9 life-threatening incidents, 232 \nhospitalizations, 116 blood transfusions, and 88 cases of infection.”5 Additionally, Chairman \nSouder noted “more than 950 adverse event cases” associated with mifepristone “out of only \n575,000 prescriptions, at most.”6 The subsequent Staff Report concluded that FDA’s approval and \nmonitoring of mifepristone was “substandard and necessitates the withdrawal of this dangerous \nand  fatal  product  before  more  women  suffer  the  known  and  anticipated  consequences  or \nfatalities.”7 The report stated the “unusual approval” demonstrated a lower standard of care for \nwomen, “and [mifepristone’s] withdrawal from the market is justified and necessary to protect the \npublic’s health.”8 \nFDA rejected the 2002 Petition on March 29, 2016 — nearly fourteen years after it was \nfiled. ECF No. 7 at 9. That same day, FDA approved several changes to the chemical abortion \ndrug regimen, including the removal of post-approval safety restrictions for pregnant women and \ngirls. Id. at 10. FDA increased the maximum gestational age from seven-weeks gestation to \nten-weeks gestation. Id. And FDA also: (1) changed the dosage for chemical abortion; (2) reduced \nthe number of required in-person office visits from three to one; (3) allowed non-doctors to \nprescribe and administer chemical abortions; and (4) eliminated the requirement for prescribers to \nreport non-fatal adverse events from chemical abortion. Id.  \n \n4 See The FDA and RU-486: Lowering the Standard for Women’s Health: Hearing Before the Subcomm. on Crim. \nJust., Drug Pol’y, & Hum. Res. of the H. Comm. on Gov’t Reform, 109th Cong. 3 (2006) (“Subcommittee Report”).  \n \n5 The transcript of the hearing before the House Subcommittee is available at https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/ \nCHRG-109hhrg31397/html/CHRG-109hhrg31397.htm. \n \n6 Id.  \n \n7 Subcommittee Report at 40. \n \n8 Id. \n4 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 137   Filed 04/07/23    Page 5 of 67   PageID 4427\nIn March 2019, Plaintiffs AAPLOG and American College of Pediatricians filed the 2019 \nPetition challenging FDA’s 2016 removal of safety restrictions. Id. On April 11, 2019, FDA \napproved GenBioPro, Inc.’s abbreviated new drug application (“ANDA”) for a generic version of \nmifepristone  without  requiring  or  reviewing  new  peer-reviewed  science  (“2019  Generic \nApproval”).  Id.  Two  years  later,  on  April  12,  2021,  FDA  announced  it  would  “exercise \nenforcement discretion” to allow “dispensing of mifepristone through the mail . . . or through a \nmail-order pharmacy” during the COVID pandemic — notwithstanding the nearly 150-year-old \nComstock Act banning the mailing of “[e]very article, instrument, substance, drug, medicine or \nthing” that produces “abortion.” Id. Finally, on December 16, 2021, FDA denied most of Plaintiff’s \n2019 Petition. Id. at 11. Specifically, FDA expressly rejected the 2019 Petition’s request to keep \nthe in-person dispensing requirements and announced that the agency would permanently allow \nchemical abortion by mail. Id.  \nAfter Plaintiffs filed suit, Danco Laboratories, LLC (“Danco”) — the holder of the NDA for \nmifepristone — moved to intervene as a defendant. ECF No. 19. On February 6, 2023, this Court \ngranted Danco’s motion. ECF No. 33. Plaintiffs  now  seek  a  preliminary  injunction  ordering \nDefendants to withdraw or suspend: (1) FDA’s 2000 Approval and 2019 Approval of mifepristone \ntablets, 200 mg, thereby removing both from the list of Approved Drugs; (2) FDA’s 2016 Changes \nand 2019 Generic Approval; and (3) FDA’s April 12, 2021, Letter and December 16, 2021, \nResponse to the 2019 Petition concerning the in-person dispensing requirement for mifepristone. \nECF No.  7  at  12.  Additionally,  Plaintiffs  seek  to  enjoin  Defendants  from  taking  actions \ninconsistent with these orders. Id.  \n \n \n5 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 137   Filed 04/07/23    Page 6 of 67   PageID 4428\nLEGAL STANDARD \nA court may issue a preliminary injunction when a movant satisfies the following four \nfactors: (1) a substantial likelihood of success on the merits; (2) a substantial threat of irreparable \nharm if the injunction does not issue; (3) the threatened injury outweighs any harm that will result \nif the injunction is granted; and (4) the grant of an injunction is in the public interest. See Louisiana \nv. Becerra, 20 F.4th 260, 262 (5th Cir. 2021). “The purpose of a preliminary injunction is always \nto prevent irreparable injury so as to preserve the court’s ability to render a meaningful decision \non the merits.” Canal Auth. of State of Fla. v. Callaway, 489 F.2d 567, 576 (5th Cir. 1974). \nThe same standards apply “to prevent irreparable injury” under the Administrative Procedure Act \n(“APA”). See 5 U.S.C. § 705; Wages & White Lion Invs., L.L.C. v. U.S. Food & Drug Admin., 16 \nF.4th 1130, 1143 (5th Cir. 2021). \nANALYSIS \nA.  Plaintiffs Have Standing \nThe judicial power of federal courts is limited to certain “Cases” and “Controversies.” \nU.S. CONST. art. III, § 2. The case-or-controversy requirement requires a plaintiff to establish he \nhas standing to sue. See Cibolo Waste, Inc. v. City of San Antonio, 718 F.3d 469, 473 (5th Cir. \n2013). To have standing, the party invoking federal jurisdiction must show: “(i) that he suffered \nan injury in fact that is concrete, particularized, and actual or imminent; (ii) that the injury was \nlikely caused by the defendant; and (iii) that the injury would likely be redressed by judicial relief.” \nTransUnion LLC v. Ramirez, 141 S. Ct. 2190, 2203 (2021). Courts should assess whether the \nalleged injury to the plaintiff has a “close relationship” to harm “traditionally” recognized as \nproviding a basis for a lawsuit in American courts. Id. at 2204. “[S]tanding is not dispensed in \n6 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 137   Filed 04/07/23    Page 7 of 67   PageID 4429\ngross; rather, plaintiffs must demonstrate standing for each claim that they press and for each form \nof relief that they seek (for example, injunctive relief and damages).” Id. at 2208.  \n1.  Plaintiff Medical Associations have Associational Standing  \n“An association or organization can establish an injury-in-fact through either of two \ntheories,  appropriately  called  ‘associational  standing’  and  ‘organizational  standing.’”  OCA-\nGreater Hous. v. Texas, 867 F.3d 604, 610 (5th Cir. 2017). Under a theory of “associational \nstanding,” an association “has standing to bring a suit on behalf of its members when its members \nwould otherwise have standing to sue in their own right, the interests at stake are germane to the \norganization’s purpose,  and neither the  claim asserted nor the  relief requested requires the \nparticipation of individual members in the lawsuit.” Tex. Ass’n of Mfrs. v. U.S. Consumer Prod. \nSafety Comm’n, 989 F.3d 368, 377 (5th Cir. 2021) (quoting Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw \nEnv’t Servs. (TOC), Inc., 528 U.S. 167, 181 (2000)).  \nHere, the associations’ members have standing because they allege adverse events from \nchemical abortion drugs can overwhelm the medical system and place “enormous pressure and \nstress” on doctors during emergencies and complications.9 ECF No. 7 at 14. These emergencies \n“consume crucial limited resources, including blood for transfusions, physician time and attention, \nspace in hospital and medical centers, and other equipment and medicines.” ECF No. 1-5 at 9. This \nis  especially  true  in  maternity-care  “deserts”  —  geographical  areas  with  limited  physician \navailability. Id. These emergencies force doctors into situations “in which they feel complicit in \nthe elective chemical abortion by needing to remove a baby with a beating heart or pregnancy \n \n9 See James Studnicki et al., A Longitudinal Cohort Study of Emergency Room Utilization Following Mifepristone \nChemical and Surgical Abortions, 1999-2015, 8 HEALTH SERV.

Members of \nPlaintiff medical associations “oppose being forced to end the life of a human being in the womb \nfor no medical reason, including by having to complete an incomplete elective chemical abortion.” \nId. at 86; see also Texas v. Becerra, No. 5:22-CV-185-H, 2022 WL 3639525, at *12 (N.D. Tex. \nAug. 23, 2022) (unwanted participation in elective abortions is cognizable under Article III).  \nPlaintiffs also argue the challenged actions “prevent Plaintiff doctors from practicing \nevidence-based medicine” and have caused Plaintiffs to face increased exposure to allegations of \nmalpractice and potential liability, along with higher insurance costs. ECF No. 7 at 15. The lack \nof information on adverse events “harms the doctor-patient relationship” because women and girls \nare  prevented  from  giving  informed  consent  to  providers.  Id.;  see  also  American  Medical \nAssociation Code of Medical Ethics, Opinion 2.1.1: Informed Consent (informed consent is \n“fundamental in both ethics and law”). To obtain informed consent, physicians must “[a]ssess the \npatient’s ability to understand relevant medical information” and present to their patient “relevant \ninformation accurately and sensitively,” including the burdens and risks of the procedure. Id.  \nWomen also perceive the harm to the informed-consent aspect of the physician-patient \nrelationship.  In  one  study,  fourteen  percent  of  women  and  girls  reported  having  received \ninsufficient information about (1) side effects, (2) the intensity of the cramping and bleeding, \n(3) the next steps after expelling the aborted human, and (4) potential negative emotional reactions \nlike fear, uncertainty, sadness, regret, and pain. See Katherine A. Rafferty & Tessa Longbons, \n#AbortionChangesYou: A Case Study to Understand the Communicative Tensions in Women’s \nMedication  Abortion  Narratives,  36  HEALTH  COMMC’N.  1485,  1485–94 \n(2021). Plaintiff physicians’  lack  of  pertinent  information  on  chemical  abortion  harms  their \nphysician-patient relationships because they cannot receive informed consent from the women and \n8 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 137   Filed 04/07/23    Page 9 of 67   PageID 4431\ngirls they treat in their clinics. Plaintiffs allege these actions have “radically altered the standard \nof care.” ECF No. 1-6 at 7. \n  Additionally, Plaintiff medical associations have associational standing via their members’ \nthird-party standing to sue on behalf of their patients. See N.Y. State Club Ass’n, Inc. v. City of \nNew York, 487 U.S. 1, 9 (1988) (“It does not matter what specific analysis is necessary to determine \nthat the members could bring the same suit.”); Pa. Psychiatric Soc. v. Green Spring Health Servs., \nInc., 280 F.3d 278, 293 (3d Cir. 2002) (“So long as the association’s members have or will suffer \nsufficient injury to merit standing and their members possess standing to represent the interests of \nthird-parties, then associations can advance the third-party claims of their members without \nsuffering injuries themselves.”); Ohio Ass’n of Indep. Schs. v. Goff, 92 F.3d 419, 422 (6th Cir. \n1996) (associational standing via member schools’ third-party standing to assert constitutional \nrights of parents to direct their children’s education); 13A Charles Alan Wright & Arthur R. Miller, \nFederal Practice and Procedure § 3531.9.3 (3d ed. 2022) (“Doctors regularly achieve standing to \nprotect the rights of patients and their own related professional rights.”).  \nThe requirements for third-party standing are met here because: (1) the patients have \n“endure[d] many intense side effects and suffer[ed] significant complications requiring medical \nattention” and “suffer distress and regret”;10 (2) the patients have a “close relation” to the physician \nmembers of the Plaintiff medical associations; and (3) “some hindrance” exists to the patients’ \nability to protect their interests. See ECF No. 7 at 13; Powers v. Ohio, 499 U.S. 400, 410–11 \n(1991); Singleton v. Wulff, 428 U.S. 106, 117 (1976) (women seeking abortions may be chilled \n“by a desire to protect the very privacy of [their] decision from the publicity of a court suit”); \n \n10 Cf. TransUnion, 141 S. Ct. at 2211 (“Nor did those plaintiffs present evidence that . . .  they suffered some other \ninjury (such as an emotional injury)”); Denney v. Deutsche Bank AG, 443 F.3d 253, 265 (2d Cir. 2006). \n \n9 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 137   Filed 04/07/23    Page 10 of 67   PageID 4432\nPa. Psychiatric, 280 F.3d at 290 (“[A] party need not face insurmountable hurdles to warrant third-\nparty standing.”). The injuries suffered by patients of the Plaintiff medical associations’ members \nare sufficient to confer associational standing. \nHere, the physician-patient dynamic favors third-party standing. Unlike abortionists suing \non behalf of women seeking abortions, here there are no potential conflicts of interest between the \nPlaintiff physicians and their patients. See June Med. Servs. L.L.C. v. Russo, 140 S. Ct. 2103, 2167 \n(2020) (Alito, J., dissenting), abrogated by Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Org., 142 S. Ct. \n2228 (2022) (abortionists have a “financial interest in avoiding burdensome regulations,” while \nwomen seeking abortions “have an interest in the preservation of regulations that protect their \nhealth”). And the case for a close physician-patient relationship is even stronger here than in the \nabortion context. See id. at 2168 (“[A] woman who obtains an abortion typically does not develop \na close relationship with the doctor who performs the procedure. On the contrary, their relationship \nis generally brief and very limited.”); see also ECF No. 1-9 at 7 (“[I]n many cases there is no \ndoctor-patient relationship [between a woman and an abortionist], so [women] often present to \noverwhelmed emergency rooms in their distress, where they are usually cared for by physicians \nother than the abortion prescriber.”); ECF No. 1-11 at 4 (because there “is no follow-up or \nadditional care provided to patients” by abortionists, there is “no established relationship with a \nphysician” and “patients are simply left to report to the emergency room”). Plaintiff physicians \noften spend several hours treating post-abortive women, even hospitalizing them overnight or \nproviding treatment throughout several visits. See ECF No. 1-8 at 5–6. Given the Supreme Court’s \njurisprudence on the close relationship between abortionists and women, the facts of this case \nindicate that Plaintiffs’ relationships with their patients are at least as close — if not closer — for \npurposes of third-party standing.  \n10 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 137   Filed 04/07/23    Page 11 of 67   PageID 4433\nFinally, women who have already obtained an abortion may be more hindered than women \nwho challenge restrictions on abortion. Women who have aborted a child — especially through \nchemical abortion drugs that necessitate the woman seeing her aborted child once it passes — often \nexperience shame, regret, anxiety, depression, drug abuse, and suicidal thoughts because of the \nabortion. See ECF No. 96 at 25; David C. Reardon et al., Deaths Associated with Pregnancy \nOutcome: A Record Linkage Study of Low Income Women, 95 S. MED. J. 834, 834–41 (2002) \n(women who receive abortions have a 154% higher risk of death from suicide than if they gave \nbirth, with persistent tendencies over time and across socioeconomic boundaries, indicating “self-\ndestructive tendencies, depression, and other unhealthy behavior aggravated by the abortion \nexperience”); Priscilla K. Coleman, Abortion and Mental Health: Quantitative Synthesis and \nAnalysis of Research Published 1995–2009, 199 BRITISH J. PSYCHIATRY 180, 180–86 (2011) \n(same). Subsequently, in addition to the typical privacy concerns present in third-party standing in \nabortion cases, adverse abortion experiences that are often deeply traumatizing pose a hindrance \nto a woman’s ability to bring suit. In short, Plaintiffs — rather than their patients — are most likely \nthe “least awkward challenger[s]” to Defendants’ actions. Craig v. Boren, 429 U.S. 190, 197 \n(1976). \n2.  Plaintiff Medical Associations have Organizational Standing \n“‘[O]rganizational  standing’  does  not  depend  on  the  standing  of  the  organization’s \nmembers.” OCA, 867 F.3d at 610. The organization can establish standing in its own name if it \n“meets  the  same  standing  test  that  applies  to  individuals.”  Id.  (internal  marks  omitted). \nAn organization can have standing if it has “proven a drain on its resources resulting from \ncounteracting the effects of the defendant’s actions.” La. ACORN Fair Hous. v. LeBlanc, 211 F.3d \n298, 305 (5th Cir. 2000); see also Zimmerman v. City of Austin, Tex., 881 F.3d 378, 390 (5th Cir. \n11 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 137   Filed 04/07/23    Page 12 of 67   PageID 4434\n2018) (changing one’s “plans or strategies in response to an allegedly injurious law can itself be a \nsufficient injury to confer standing”). “Such concrete and demonstrable injury to the organization’s \nactivities—with the consequent drain on the organization’s resources—constitutes far more than \nsimply a setback to the organization’s abstract social interests.” Havens Realty Corp. v. Coleman, \n455 U.S. 363, 379 (1982) (internal marks omitted). \n  One way an organization can establish standing is by “identifying specific projects that [it] \nhad to put on hold or otherwise curtail in order to respond to the [challenged action].” Tex. State \nLULAC v. Elfant, 52 F.4th 248, 253 (5th Cir. 2022) (internal marks omitted). This is “not a \nheightening of the Lujan standard,11 but an example of how to satisfy it by pointing to a non-\nlitigation-related expense.” OCA, 867 F.3d at 612. Plaintiffs “need not identify specific projects \nthat they have placed on hold or otherwise curtailed.”12 La Unión del Pueblo Entero v. Abbott, No. \n5:21-CV-0844-XR, 2022 WL 3052489, at *31 (W.D. Tex. Aug. 2, 2022). Rather, this is simply \nthe “most secure foundation” to establish organizational standing. 13A Charles Alan Wright & \nArthur R. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure § 3531.9.5 (3d ed. 2022). Furthermore, “‘[a]t \nthe pleading stage,’ we ‘liberally’ construe allegations of injury.” Bezet v. United States, 714 Fed. \nAppx. 336, 339 (5th Cir. 2017) (quoting Little v. KPMG LLP, 575 F.3d 533, 540 (5th Cir. 2009)). \n  Here, Plaintiff medical associations have standing via diversionary injury. Because of \nFDA’s failure to require reporting of all adverse events, Plaintiffs allege FDA’s actions have \nfrustrated their ability to educate and inform their member physicians, their patients, and the public \non the dangers of chemical abortion drugs. ECF No. 7 at 12. As a result, Plaintiffs attest they have \n \n11 See Lujan v. Defs. of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555 (1992). \n \n12 At the hearing, Danco argued Elfant held there was no standing where organizations failed to identify specific \nprojects put on hold. ECF No. 136 at 125. This is incorrect. The Fifth Circuit in Elfant assumed without deciding the \nplaintiffs pled an injury-in-fact but held they did not have standing because the causation and redressability elements \nwere not met. See 52 F.4th at 255.  \n \n12 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 137   Filed 04/07/23    Page 13 of 67   PageID 4435\ndiverted valuable resources away from advocacy and educational efforts to compensate for the \nlack of information. See ECF No. 1 at 91. Such diversions expend considerable time, energy, and \nresources, to the detriment of other priorities and functions and impair Plaintiffs’ ability to carry \nout their educational purpose. Id. at 92; N.A.A.C.P. v. City of Kyle, Tex., 626 F.3d 233, 238 (5th \nCir. 2010).13 Similarly, Plaintiffs allege their efforts to respond to FDA’s actions have “tak[en] \nthem away from other priorities such as fundraising and membership recruitment and retention.” \nECF Nos. 1-4 at 6, 1-5 at 11. Consequently, Plaintiffs have re-calibrated their outreach efforts to \nspend extra time and money educating their members about the dangers of chemical abortion \ndrugs. Combined, these facts are sufficient to confer organizational standing. See OCA, 867 F.3d \nat 612 (finding organizational standing even where the injury “was not large”); Fowler, 178 F.3d \nat  356  (injuries  in  fact  “need  not  measure  more  than  an  ‘identifiable  trifle’”)  (internal \nmarks omitted). \n3.  Plaintiffs’ alleged Injuries are Concrete and Redressable  \nDefendants contend that Plaintiffs’ theories of standing “depend upon layer after layer of \nspeculation.” ECF No. 28 at 20. But Plaintiffs allege FDA’s chemical abortion regimen “caused” \nintense side effects and significant complications for their patients requiring medical intervention \nand attention. ECF No. 7 at 13; see id. (“The harms that the FDA has wreaked on women and girls \nhave also injured, and will continue to injure, Plaintiff doctors and their medical practices.”); id. at \n14 (“The FDA’s actions have placed enormous pressure and stress on Plaintiff doctors during these \n \n13 It is true that Plaintiffs must allege their activities in response to the challenged actions differ from their “routine” \nactivities. See, e.g., City of Kyle, 626 F.3d at 238. But Plaintiffs have done so. For example, Plaintiffs argue they \nconducted independent studies and analyses of available data to the detriment of their advocacy, educational, and \nrecruitment efforts. ECF No. 1-8 at 8. The Fifth Circuit has found diversionary injuries to constitute injuries-in-fact \neven where it was less clear the plaintiffs diverted from routine activities. See Ass’n of Cmty. Orgs. for Reform Now \nv. Fowler, 178 F.3d 350, 360 (5th Cir. 1999) (injury-in-fact where organization regularly conducted voter \nregistration drives and “expended resources registering voters in low registration areas who would have already been \nregistered” if not for the challenged actions). \n13 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 137   Filed 04/07/23    Page 14 of 67   PageID 4436\nemergency situations.”); id. at 15 (“The FDA has caused Plaintiff doctors to face increased \nexposure to allegations of malpractice and potential liability, along with higher insurance costs.”). \nIn fact, Plaintiffs’ declarations list specific events where Plaintiff physicians provided emergency \ncare to women suffering from chemical abortion. See ECF Nos. 1-8 at 5–6, 1-9 at 4–9, 1-10 at 6–\n7, 1-11 at 5–6. And Defendants even concede the existence of adverse events related to chemical \nabortion drugs. See ECF No. 28 at 21. Consequently, Defendants misconstrue Plaintiffs’ pleadings \nand mischaracterize Plaintiffs’ evidence as “speculative.” It is not. \nPast injuries thus distinguish this case from Clapper v. Amnesty Int’l USA, where the \nSupreme Court held a “threatened injury must be certainly impending to constitute injury in fact.” \n568 U.S. 398, 410 (2013) (quoting Whitmore v. Arkansas, 495 U.S. 149, 157–58 (1990)). Were \nthere no past injuries in this case, the alleged future harms are still less attenuated than those in \nClapper. See id. (finding “a highly attenuated chain of” five separate possibilities needed to align \nfor the alleged harm to occur); McCardell v. U.S. Dep’t of Hous. & Urb. Dev., 794 F.3d 510, 520 \n(5th Cir. 2015) (“[U]nlike in Clapper, where the alleged injury depended on a long and tenuous \nchain of contingent events, the chain-of-events framework in this case involves fewer steps and no \nunfounded assumptions.”) (internal marks omitted). See also ECF No. 1-31 at 10 (roughly eight \npercent of women who use abortion pills will require surgical abortion); ECF No. 1-14 at 23 \n(discussing a study in which 18.3 percent of women required surgical intervention after chemical \nabortion). And as post-Whitmore cases have demonstrated, the “certainly impending” standard for \nan “imminent” injury is not as demanding as it sounds. See TransUnion, 141 S. Ct. at 2197 \n(material risk of future harm can suffice “so long as the risk of harm is sufficiently imminent and \nsubstantial”); Susan B. Anthony List v. Driehaus, 573 U.S. 149, 158 (2014) (“An allegation of \nfuture injury may suffice if the threatened injury is ‘certainly impending,’ or there is a ‘substantial \n14 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 137   Filed 04/07/23    Page 15 of 67   PageID 4437\nrisk’ that the harm will occur.”) (emphasis added); Clapper, 568 U.S. at 414 n.5; Massachusetts v. \nE.P.A., 549 U.S. 497, 526 n.23 (2007) (“Even a small probability of injury is sufficient . . . provided \nof course that the relief sought would, if granted, reduce the probability.”); Deanda v. Becerra, \nNo. 2:20-CV-092-Z, 2022 WL 17572093, at *2 (N.D. Tex. Dec. 8, 2022) (collecting cases).14 \nFor similar reasons, Defendants’ reliance on City of Los Angeles v. Lyons also fails. \n461 U.S. 95 (1983). There, the Supreme Court held Lyons did not have standing to seek injunctive \nrelief because “[t]here was no finding that Lyons faced a real and immediate threat of again being \nillegally choked” by Los Angeles police. Id. at 110. The Lyons holding “is based on the obvious \nproposition that a prospective remedy will provide no relief for an injury that is, and likely will \nremain, entirely in the past.” Am. Postal Workers Union v. Frank, 968 F.2d 1373, 1376 (1st Cir. \n1992). “No such reluctance, however, is warranted here.” Hernandez v. Cremer, 913 F.2d 230, \n234 (5th Cir. 1990). Considering FDA’s 2021 decision to permit “mail-in” chemical abortion, \nmany  women  and  girls  will  consume  mifepristone  without  physician  supervision.  And in \nmaternity-care “deserts,” women may not have ready access to emergency care. In sum, there are \nfewer safety restrictions for women and girls today than ever before. Plaintiffs have good reasons \nto believe their alleged injuries will continue in the future, and possibly with greater frequency \nthan in the past.  \n \n \n14 Defendants’ reliance on Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins is also unavailing. 578 U.S. 330 (2016). Courts should indeed \nassess whether the alleged injury to the plaintiff has a “close relationship” to harm “traditionally” recognized as the \nbasis for a lawsuit in American courts. See TransUnion, 141 S. Ct. at 2204. But “a plaintiff doesn’t need to \ndemonstrate that the level of harm he has suffered would be actionable under a similar, common-law cause of \naction.” Perez v. McCreary, Veselka, Bragg & Allen, P.C., 45 F.4th 816, 822 (5th Cir. 2022). Rather, Plaintiffs only \nneed to show the type of harm allegedly suffered “is similar in kind to a type of harm that the common law has \nrecognized as actionable.” Id.; see also Campaign Legal Ctr. v. Scott, 49 F.4th 931, 940 (5th Cir. 2022) (Ho., J, \nconcurring) (evidence of injury required by TransUnion is not burdensome). Harm resulting from unsafe drugs is \nsimilar to harm actionable under the common law. \n15 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 137   Filed 04/07/23    Page 16 of 67   PageID 4438\n  Defendants  next  argue  Plaintiffs’  theories  depend  on  “unfettered  choices  made  by \nindependent actors not before the courts and whose exercise of broad and legitimate discretion the \ncourts cannot presume either to control or to predict.” ECF No. 28 at 20 (quoting Lujan, 504 U.S. \nat 562). “[A] plaintiff must allege personal injury fairly traceable to the defendant’s allegedly \nunlawful conduct and likely to be redressed by the requested relief.” Allen v. Wright, 468 U.S. 737, \n751 (1984), abrogated on other grounds by Lexmark Int’l, Inc. v. Static Control Components, Inc., \n572 U.S. 118, 134 (2014); see also Simon v. E. Ky. Welfare Rts. Org., 426 U.S. 26, 41–42 (1976) \n(“In other words, the ‘case or controversy’ limitation of Art. III still requires that a federal court \nact only to redress injury that fairly can be traced to the challenged action of the defendant, and \nnot injury that results from the independent action of some third party not before the court.”).  \n  In this case, a favorable decision would likely relieve Plaintiffs of at least some of the \ninjuries  allegedly  caused  by  FDA.  See  Larson  v.  Valente,  456  U.S.  228,  243  n.15  (1982) \n(“[Plaintiffs] need not show that a favorable decision will relieve [their] every injury.”); Duke \nPower  Co.  v.  Carolina  Env’t  Study  Grp.,  Inc.,  438  U.S.  59,  74–75  (1978)  (a  “substantial \nlikelihood” of the requested relief redressing the alleged injury is enough); Sanchez v. R.G.L., 761 \nF.3d 495, 506 (5th Cir. 2014) (a plaintiff “need only show that a favorable ruling could potentially \nlessen its injury”); Texas v. Becerra, 577 F. Supp. 3d 527, 560 (N.D. Tex. 2021) (“That the \nplaintiffs have brought forth specific evidence and examples of how they will be harmed . . . \ndistinguishes this case from others where a third party’s actions might have hurt the plaintiff.”). \nAnd redressability is satisfied even if relief must filter downstream through third parties uncertain \nto comply with the result, provided the relief would either: (1) remove an obstacle for a nonparty \nto act in a way favorable to the plaintiff; or (2) influence a nonparty to act in such a way. See, e.g., \nDep’t of Com. v. New York, 139 S. Ct. 2551, 2565–66 (2019) (“[T]hird parties will likely react in \n16 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 137   Filed 04/07/23    Page 17 of 67   PageID 4439\npredictable ways.”); Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 169 (1997) (defendants’ actions need not be \n“the very last step in the chain of causation”); Larson, 456 U.S. at 242–44; NiGen Biotech, L.L.C. \nv. Paxton, 804 F.3d 389, 396–98 (5th Cir. 2015). Therefore, Plaintiffs’ alleged injuries are fairly \ntraceable to Defendants and redressable by a favorable decision.  \n4.  Plaintiffs are within the “Zone of Interests”  \n  Plaintiffs are also within the zone of interests of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act \n(“FFDCA”) and the Comstock Act. Plaintiffs suing under the APA must assert an interest that is \n“arguably within the zone of interests to be protected or regulated by the statute that they say was \nviolated.” Texas v. United States, 809 F.3d 134, 162 (5th Cir. 2015) (internal marks omitted). \nThe zone-of-interests test “is not meant to be especially demanding” and is applied “in keeping \nwith Congress’s evident intent when enacting the APA to make agency action presumptively \nreviewable.” Id. (internal marks omitted). The zone-of-interests test “looks to the law’s substantive \nprovisions to determine what interests (and hence which plaintiffs) are protected.” Simmons v. \nUBS Fin. Servs., Inc., 972 F.3d 664, 669 (5th Cir. 2020). “That interest, at times, may reflect \naesthetic, conservational, and recreational as well as economic values.” Ass’n of Data Processing \nServ. Orgs., Inc. v. Camp, 397 U.S. 150, 154 (1970).  \n  A federal court’s obligation to hear and decide cases within its jurisdiction is “virtually \nunflagging.” Lexmark, 572 U.S. at 126 (internal marks omitted). And “the trend is toward \nenlargement of the class of people who may protest administrative action.” Camp, 397 U.S. at 154. \nNo “explicit statutory provision” is necessary to confer standing. Id. at 155. “The test forecloses \nsuit only when a plaintiff’s interests are so marginally related to or inconsistent with the purposes \nimplicit in the statute that it cannot reasonably be assumed that Congress intended to permit the \nsuit.” Texas v. United States, 809 F.3d at 162 (internal marks omitted). In other words, “[t]here is \n17 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 137   Filed 04/07/23    Page 18 of 67   PageID 4440\nno presumption against judicial review and in favor of administrative absolutism unless that \npurpose is fairly discernible in the statutory scheme.” Camp, 397 U.S. at 157 (internal marks \nomitted); see also Barlow v. Collins, 397 U.S. 159, 165 (1970) (courts “must decide if Congress \nhas in express or implied terms precluded judicial review or committed the challenged action \nentirely to administrative discretion”). \n  Defendants argue that Plaintiffs identify no particular provision of the FFDCA protecting \ntheir interests. ECF No. 28 at 26. But Plaintiffs’ interests are not “marginally related” to the \npurposes  implicit  in the  FFDCA.  The  statute’s  substantive  provisions protect  the  safety  of \nphysicians’ patients and the integrity of the physician-patient relationship. See generally 21 U.S.C. \n§ 355. Furthermore, this Court finds Plaintiffs have third-party standing on behalf of their patients. \nPlaintiffs’ patients are within the zone of interest of the FFDCA because patients seek safe and \neffective medical procedures.  \n  Likewise, Plaintiffs are within the zone of interests of the Comstock Act. This statute \n“indicates a national policy of discountenancing abortion as inimical to the national life.” Bours v. \nUnited States, 229 F. 960, 964 (7th Cir. 1915); see also Bolger v. Youngs Drug Prods. Corp., 463 \nU.S. 60, 71 n.19 (1983) (the “thrust” of the Comstock Act was “to prevent the mails from being \nused to corrupt the public morals”). There is no evidence that Congress “sought to preclude judicial \nreview of administrative rulings” by FDA “as to the legitimate scope of activities” available \nconcerning chemical abortion drugs under these statutes. Camp, 397 U.S. at 157. For all the \naforementioned reasons, Plaintiffs have standing.  \nB.  Plaintiffs’ Claims Are Reviewable \nDefendants aver that “[a]ll of Plaintiffs’ claims are untimely or unexhausted except their \nchallenge to FDA’s December 16, 2021, response to the 2019 citizen petition.” ECF No. 28 at 26. \n18 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 137   Filed 04/07/23    Page 19 of 67   PageID 4441\nThis includes Plaintiffs’ challenges to: (1) the 2000 Approval and FDA’s 2016 Response to the \n2002 Petition challenging that approval; (2) the 2019 Generic Approval; and (3), the April 2021 \nletter. As for FDA’s December 2021 Response to the 2019 Petition, Defendants maintain review \nis limited to the narrow issues presented in the 2019 Petition — which did not include arguments \nconcerning the Comstock Act. Id. at 27–28.15 The Court disagrees with each of these arguments. \n1.  FDA “Reopened” its Decision in 2016 and 2021 \n \nFDA’s final decision on a citizen petition constitutes “final agency action” under the APA. \n21 C.F.R. § 10.45(c). Challenges to agency actions have a six-year statute of limitations period. \nSee 28 U.S.C. § 2401(a). Therefore, the statute of limitations for challenging the 2000 Approval \nbegan running on March 29, 2016 — the date of FDA’s denial of the 2002 Petition. Because the \n2016 Denial of the 2002 Petition occurred more than six years before Plaintiffs filed this suit, \nDefendants argue the challenge is untimely. ECF No. 28 at 26. But if “the agency opened the issue \nup anew, and then reexamined and reaffirmed its prior decision,” the agency’s second action — \nrather than the original decision — starts the limitations period. See Texas v. Biden, 20 F.4th 928, \n951 (5th Cir. 2021), rev’d in part on other grounds, 142 S. Ct. 2528 (2022).  \nThe reopening doctrine arises “where an agency conducts a rulemaking or adopts a policy \non an issue at one time, and then in a later rulemaking restates the policy or otherwise addresses \nthe issue again without altering the original decision.”16 Wash. All. of Tech. Workers v. U.S. Dep’t \nof Homeland Sec., 892 F.3d 332, 345 (D.C. Cir. 2018); see also Nat’l Biodiesel Bd. v. EPA, 843 \nF.3d 1010, 1017 (D.C. Cir. 2016) (“The reopener doctrine allows an otherwise untimely challenge \n \n15 The Court refers to the 2000 Approval, the 2016 Changes and denial of the 2002 Petition, and the 2019 Generic \nApproval collectively as FDA’s “Pre-2021 Actions.” Similarly, the Court refers to FDA’s April 2021 letter and \nDecember 2021 Response as FDA’s “2021 Actions.” \n \n16 Courts have even applied the doctrine where agencies decide not to engage in rulemaking and then revisit and \nreaffirm that decision. See Pub. Citizen v. Nuclear Regul. Comm’n, 901 F.2d 147, 152 (D.C. Cir. 1990). \n19 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 137   Filed 04/07/23    Page 20 of 67   PageID 4442\nto proceed where an agency has — either explicitly or implicitly — undertaken to reexamine its \nformer choice.”) (internal marks omitted); CTIA-Wireless Ass’n v. F.C.C., 466 F.3d 105, 112 (D.C. \nCir.  2006)  (agency  “reconsidered”  policy  by  reaffirming  policy  and  offering  “two  new \njustifications” not found in prior orders).  \nIn the rulemaking context, courts have identified four non-exhaustive factors to apply the \ndoctrine where the agency: (1) proposed to make some change in the rules or policies; (2) called \nfor comment on new or changed provisions, but at the same time; (3) explained the unchanged, \nrepublished portions; and (4) responded to at least one comment aimed at the previously decided \nissue.  Tripoli  Rocketry  Ass’n,  Inc.  v.  U.S.  Bureau  of  Alcohol,  Tobacco  &  Firearms,  No. \n00CV0273(RBW), 2002 WL 33253171, at *6 (D.D.C. June 24, 2002) (internal marks omitted). \nBut a court “cannot stop there” — it “must look to the entire context of the rulemaking including \nall relevant proposals and reactions of the agency to determine whether an issue was in fact \nreopened.” Pub. Citizen, 901 F.2d at 150. For example, an agency can reopen a prior action if it \nremoves restrictions or safeguards related to the first action or affects a “sea change” in the \nregulatory scheme. See Sierra Club v. EPA, 551 F.3d 1019, 1025 (D.C. Cir. 2008); Nat’l Biodiesel, \n843 F.3d at 1017 (declining to apply doctrine when “the basic regulatory scheme remain[ed] \nunchanged”); Pub. Citizen, 901 F.2d at 152 (agency reopens decision when it reiterates a policy in \nsuch a way as to render the policy “subject to renewed challenge on any substantive grounds”). \nIn the adjudication context, an agency need not solicit or respond to comments to reopen a \ndecision because adjudication does not require notice and comment procedures. See 5 U.S.C. §§ \n553(c), 554. The reopening doctrine has been applied in the adjudication context where an agency \nundertakes  a  “serious,  substantive  reconsideration”  of  “a  prior  administrative  decision.” \nChenault v. McHugh, 968 F. Supp. 2d 268, 275 (D.D.C. 2013); see also Battle v. Sec’y U.S. Dep’t \n20 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 137   Filed 04/07/23    Page 21 of 67   PageID 4443\nof Navy, 757 Fed. Appx. 172, 175 (3d Cir. 2018) (a petition for reconsideration can restart Section \n2401(a)’s limitation period if the agency reopens the action based on a finding of “new evidence” \nor that the petition reflects some “changed circumstances”); Peavey v. United States, 128 F. Supp. \n3d 85, 100 (D.D.C. 2015), aff’d, No. 15-5290, 2016 WL 4098768 (D.C. Cir. 2016) (reopening in \n2011 occurred where agency “elected to conduct a substantive review” of servicemember’s 1968 \napplication to correct military records). For formal agency adjudications, even an order stating \n“only that it is denying reconsideration” is not conclusive if the agency has “altered its original \ndecision.” Sendra Corp. v. Magaw, 111 F.3d 162, 167 (D.C. Cir. 1997).  \nThe standard for reopening is satisfied here. FDA’s requirements for distribution in its 2000 \nApproval originally included: \n  In-person dispensing from the doctor to the patient; \n \n  Secure shipping procedures; \n \n  Tracking system ability; \n \n  Use of authorized distributors and agents; and \n \n  Provision of the drug through direct, confidential physician distribution systems that \nensures only qualified physicians will receive the drug for patient dispensing. \n \nSee ECF No. 1 at 40. FDA’s 2016 Changes to this regulatory scheme included the following \nalterations: \n  Extending the maximum gestational age at which a woman or girl can abort her unborn \nchild from 49 days to 70 days; \n \n  Altering the mifepristone dosage from 600 mg to 200 mg, the misoprostol dosage from \n400 mcg to 800 mcg, and misoprostol administration from oral to buccal; \n \n  Eliminating the requirement that administration of misoprostol occur in-clinic; \n \n  Broadening the window for misoprostol administration to include a range of 24–48 \nhours after taking mifepristone, instead of 48 hours afterward; \n \n21 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 137   Filed 04/07/23    Page 22 of 67   PageID 4444\n  Adding a repeat 800 mcg buccal dose of misoprostol in the event of incomplete \nchemical abortion; \n \n  Removing the requirement for an in-person follow-up examination after an abortion;  \n \n  Allowing “healthcare providers” other than physicians to dispense and administer the \nchemical abortion drugs; and \n \n  Eliminating the requirement for prescribers to report all non-fatal serious adverse \nevents from chemical abortion drugs.  \n \nId. at 53–54. And in 2021, FDA removed the “in-person dispensing requirement” and signaled that \nit will soon allow pharmacies to dispense chemical abortion drugs. Id. at 68. Plaintiffs warn that \nwithout this requirement, “there is a dramatically reduced chance that the prescriber can confirm \npregnancy and gestational age, discover ectopic pregnancies, and identify a victim of abuse or \nhuman trafficking being coerced into having a chemical abortion.” ECF No. 120 at 19.  \n  FDA’s 2016 and 2021 Changes thus significantly departed from the agency’s original \napproval of the abortion regimen. FDA repeatedly altered its original decision by removing \nsafeguards and changing the regulatory scheme for chemical abortion drugs. Sierra Club, 551 F.3d \nat 1025; Nat’l Biodiesel, 843 F.3d at 1017. Additionally, FDA’s response to the 2019 Petition \nexplicitly states FDA “undertook a full review of the Mifepristone REMS Program” in 2021. ECF \nNo. 1-44 at 7 (emphasis added);17 see also Peavey, 128 F. Supp. 3d at 100–02 (agency reopened \ndecision by conducting “thorough review” of the merits, even where the order did not state it was \na “reconsideration” and did not reference prior decision). And FDA even granted the 2019 Petition \nin part. ECF No. 1-44 at 3. A “full review” of a REMS for a drug with known serious risks \nnecessarily considers the possibility that a drug is too dangerous to be on the market, any mitigation \n \n17 See also Questions and Answers on Mifepristone for Medical Termination of Pregnancy Through Ten Weeks \nGestation, FDA (Jan. 4, 2023), https://www.fda.gov/drugs/postmarket-drug-safety-information-patients-and-\nproviders/questions-and-answers-mifepristone-medical-termination-pregnancy-through-ten-weeks-gestation \n(describing the 2021 review as “comprehensive”). \n22 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 137   Filed 04/07/23    Page 23 of 67   PageID 4445\nstrategy notwithstanding. FDA has the authority to withdraw an approved drug application on this \nbasis. See 21 U.S.C. § 355(e). Because the agency reaffirmed its prior actions after undertaking a \nsubstantive reconsideration of those actions, the limitations period for those actions starts in 2021. \nSee Pub. Citizen, 901 F.2d at 152 (an agency reconsidering and reaffirming original policy \n“necessarily raises the lawfulness of the original policy, for agencies have an everpresent duty to \ninsure that their actions are lawful”).18  \n  Alternatively, the Court finds Plaintiffs’ claims are not time-barred under the equitable \ntolling doctrine. See United States v. Patterson, 211 F.3d 927, 931 (5th Cir. 2000) (courts “must \nbe cautious not to apply the statute of limitations too harshly”); P & V Enters. v. U.S. Army Corps \nof Engr’s, 466 F. Supp. 2d 134, 149 (D.D.C. 2006), aff’d, 516 F.3d 1021 (D.C. Cir. 2008) (a \n“rebuttable  presumption  of  equitable  tolling”  applies  to  lawsuits  governed  by  the  six-year \nlimitations period of Section 2401(a)); Bornholdt v. Brady, 869 F.2d 57, 64 (2d Cir. 1989) (“The \nexistence of § 2401 as a catchall provision . . . does not necessarily mean that Congress intended \nthe six-year period to be applied whenever a substantive statute does not specify a limitations \nperiod.”). “[A] litigant is entitled to equitable tolling of a statute of limitations only if the litigant \nestablishes two elements: (1) that he has been pursuing his rights diligently, and (2) that some \nextraordinary circumstance stood in his way and prevented timely filing.” Menominee Indian Tribe \nof Wis. v. United States, 577 U.S. 250, 255 (2016) (internal marks omitted); see also Holland v. \nFlorida, 560 U.S. 631, 650 (2010) (“The flexibility inherent in equitable procedure enables courts \n \n18 To date, it is unclear whether the reopening doctrine has been applied in the precise context of FDA’s approval of \nan NDA. However, much of the rationale courts have applied in both the rulemaking and adjudication context \napplies here. And the Court is unaware of any legal principle that would preclude the doctrine from being applied to \nthese facts. Assuming arguendo Plaintiffs’ allegations are true, a contrary holding would mean there is no judicial \nremedy to FDA’s insistence on keeping an unsafe drug on the market, so long as enough time has passed. \n23 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 137   Filed 04/07/23    Page 24 of 67   PageID 4446\nto meet new situations that demand equitable intervention, and to accord all the relief necessary to \ncorrect particular injustices.”) (cleaned up).  \n  Equitable tolling is appropriate here in large part because of FDA’s unreasonable delay in \nresponding to Plaintiff’s 2002 and 2019 Petitions. See WildEarth Guardians v. U.S. Dep’t of Just., \n181 F. Supp. 3d 651, 670 (D. Ariz. 2015) (it is “grossly inappropriate” to apply a statute of \nlimitations where the agency unreasonably delayed a claim because the agency “could immunize \nits allegedly unreasonable delay from judicial review simply by extending that delay for six years”) \n(internal marks omitted). It took FDA 13 years, 7 months, and 9 days to respond to the 2002 \nPetition. FDA then moved the goalposts by substantially changing the regulatory scheme on the \nsame day it issued its Response. And it took FDA 2 years, 8 months, and 17 days to respond to the \n2019 Petition which challenged those changes. Thus, in the 20 years between the 2002 Petition \nand the filing of this suit, Plaintiffs were waiting on FDA for over 16 of those years. See Hill \nDermaceuticals, Inc. v. U.S. Food & Drug Admin., 524 F. Supp. 2d 5, 9 (D.D.C. 2007) (“Once \ncitizen petitions are submitted, the FDA Commissioner is required to respond in one of three \nmanners ‘within 180 days of receipt of the petition.’”) (quoting 21 C.F.R. § 10.30(e)(2)).19  \n  Additionally,  statutes  of  limitations  “are  primarily  designed  to  assure  fairness  to \ndefendants,” and “to promote justice by preventing surprises through the revival of claims that \nhave been allowed to slumber until evidence is lost, memories have faded, and witnesses have \ndisappeared.” Clymore v. United States, 217 F.3d 370, 376 (5th Cir. 2000), as corrected on reh’g \n(Aug. 24, 2000) (internal marks omitted). But it “has not been argued, and cannot seriously be, \nthat the government was unfairly surprised” when Plaintiffs filed this suit. Id. Plaintiffs have been \n \n19 Incidentally, the delayed FDA Response is extreme but not unprecedented. See, e.g., Bayer HealthCare, LLC v. \nU.S. Food & Drug Admin., 942 F. Supp. 2d 17, 22 (D.D.C. 2013) (FDA had yet to respond to a 2006 petition when \nit approved a related ANDA in 2013). \n24 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 137   Filed 04/07/23    Page 25 of 67   PageID 4447\nreasonably diligent in pursuing their claims. See, e.g., ECF No. 1-4 at 6 (after years of waiting for \nFDA to respond to the Petition, Plaintiff “called upon” FDA to issue a response in 2005 and again \nin 2015). And the public interest in this case militates toward resolving Plaintiffs’ claims on the \nmerits. Accordingly, Plaintiffs’ challenges to FDA’s Pre-2021 Actions concerning chemical \nabortion drugs are not time-barred.  \n2.  FDA’s  April  2021  Decision  on  In-Person  Dispensing  Requirements  is  not \n“Committed to Agency Discretion by Law” \n \nDefendants also argue any challenge to FDA’s decision regarding the in-person dispensing \nrequirement is foreclosed under Heckler v. Chaney, 470 U.S. 821, 832 (1985). ECF No. 28 at 30. \nIn Heckler, the Supreme Court held that FDA’s decision not to recommend civil or criminal \nenforcement action to prevent violations of the FFDCA was “committed to agency discretion by \nlaw.” 470 U.S. at 837–38; see also Texas v. Biden, 20 F.4th at 982 (“In other words, a litigant may \nnot waltz into court, point his finger, and demand an agency investigate (or sue, or otherwise \nenforce against) ‘that person over there.’”). “[T]he Supreme Court and the Fifth Circuit have \nconsistently read Heckler as sheltering one-off nonenforcement decisions rather than decisions to \nsuspend entire statutes.” Texas v. Biden, 20 F.4th at 983. The “committed to agency discretion by \nlaw” exception to judicial review is a “very narrow exception” that applies only where “statutes \nare drawn in such broad terms that in a given case there is no law to apply.” Citizens to Pres. \nOverton Park, Inc. v. Volpe, 401 U.S. 402, 410 (1971), overruled on other grounds by Califano v. \nSanders, 430 U.S. 99 (1977).  \nThat is not the case here. The Secretary has the authority to determine that drugs with \n“known serious risks” may be dispensed “only in certain health care settings, such as hospitals.” \nSee 21 U.S.C. § 355-1(f)(3)(C); Gomperts v. Azar, No. 1:19-CV-00345-DCN, 2020 WL 3963864, \nat *1 (D. Idaho July 13, 2020) (“[T]hese restrictions mandate that Mifeprex be dispensed only in \n25 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 137   Filed 04/07/23    Page 26 of 67   PageID 4448\ncertain healthcare settings”).20 The statute also provides other “elements to assure safe use” of \ndangerous drugs. 21 U.S.C. § 355-1(f)(1), (3). The Secretary must publicly explain “how such \nelements will mitigate the observed safety risk.” 21 U.S.C. § 355-1(f)(2). The Secretary must also \nconsider whether the elements would “be unduly burdensome on patient access to the drug” and \nmust “minimize the burden on the health care delivery system.” Id. Additionally, the elements \n“shall include [one] or more goals to mitigate a specific serious risk listed in the labeling of the \ndrug.” 21 U.S.C. § 355-1(f)(3). And as the Court will later explain, federal law prohibits the \nmailing of chemical abortion drugs. Thus, unlike in Heckler, there is “law to apply” to FDA’s \ndecision. See Texas v. Biden, 20 F.4th at 982 (“[T]he executive cannot look at a statute, recognize \nthat the statute is telling it to enforce the law in a particular way or against a particular entity, and \ntell Congress to pound sand.”). And even if Defendants have significant discretion in how they \nadminister Section 355-1, that does not mean all related actions are immune to judicial review \nunder Section 701(a)(2) of the APA.  \nIn  sum,  Defendants  cannot  shield  their  decisions  from  judicial  review  merely  by \ncharacterizing the challenged action as exercising “enforcement discretion.” ECF No. 28 at 15; see \nalso Texas v. Biden, 20 F.4th at 987 (“The Government is still engaged in enforcement — even if \nit chooses to do so in a way that ignores the statute. That’s obviously not nonenforcement.”); id. \nat 985 (“Heckler cannot apply to agency actions that qualify as rules under 5 U.S.C. § 551(4).”); \nHeckler, 470 U.S. at 833 n.4 (a decision to consciously and expressly adopt a general policy that \nis “so extreme as to amount to abdication of its statutory responsibilities” is not “committed to \nagency discretion”) (emphasis added). Furthermore, the suggestion that FDA has full discretion \n \n20 See also Frequently Asked Questions (FAQS) about REMS, FDA (Jan. 26, 2018), https://www.fda.gov/drugs/risk-\nevaluation-and-mitigation-strategies-rems/frequently-asked-questions-faqs-about-rems (“A REMS is required to \nensure the drug is administered only in a health care facility with personnel trained to manage severe allergic \nreactions and immediate access to necessary treatments and equipment to managing such events.”). \n26 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 137   Filed 04/07/23    Page 27 of 67   PageID 4449\nunder  Section  355-1  to  not  require  any  REMS  for  dangerous  drugs  would  likely  present \nnondelegation problems even under a modest view of that doctrine. See, e.g., Gundy v. United \nStates, 139 S. Ct. 2116, 2123 (2019). So too the notion that FDA could exercise its non-\nenforcement discretion in violation of other federal laws. Therefore, FDA’s decision to not enforce \nthe in-person dispensing requirement is reviewable because the decision is not committed to \nagency discretion by law. \n3.  Plaintiffs’ Failure to Exhaust Certain Claims is Excusable \n  Plaintiffs allege FDA’s 2021 Decision to dispense mifepristone through the mail did not \nacknowledge  or  address  federal  criminal  laws  that  “expressly  prohibit[]  such  downstream \ndistribution.” ECF No. 7 at 26. Defendants maintain Plaintiffs’ argument is unexhausted because \nthey failed to present it at any stage of any administrative proceeding. ECF No. 28 at 38. Similarly, \nPlaintiffs have not exhausted their challenge to FDA’s approval of the supplemental NDA for \ngeneric mifepristone. Id. at 26. These failures to exhaust claims do not preclude judicial review. \n  “The general rule of nonreviewability is not absolute.” Myron v. Martin, 670 F.2d 49, 52 \n(5th Cir. 1982). To begin, exhaustion is not required where the agency action is “in excess of” the \nagency’s authority. Id. And a court will review for the first time “a particular challenge to an \nagency’s decision which was not raised during the agency proceedings” where the agency action \nis “likely to result in individual injustice” or is “contrary to an important public policy extending \nbeyond the rights of the individual litigants.” Id.; see also Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 330 \n(1976) (“[C]ases may arise where a claimant’s interest in having a particular issue resolved \npromptly  is  so  great  that  deference  to  the  agency’s  judgment  is  inappropriate.”);  Abbott \nLaboratories v. Gardner, 387 U.S. 136, 149 (1967) (injunctive remedies applied to administrative \ndeterminations should evaluate “both the fitness of the issues for judicial decision and the hardship \n27 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 137   Filed 04/07/23    Page 28 of 67   PageID 4450\nto the parties of withholding court consideration”); Dawson Farms, LLC v. Farm Serv. Agency, \n504 F.3d 592, 606 (5th Cir. 2007) (exhaustion may be excused when “irreparable injury will result \nabsent immediate judicial review”); Bd. of Pub. Instruction of Taylor Cnty., Fla. v. Finch, 414 \nF.2d 1068, 1072 (5th Cir. 1969) (exceptional circumstances include “where injustice might \notherwise result”). \nCourts have also excused a claimant’s failure to exhaust administrative remedies where \nexhaustion “would be futile because the administrative agency will clearly reject the claim.” \nGulf Restoration Network v. Salazar, 683 F.3d 158, 176 (5th Cir. 2012) (internal marks omitted); \nsee also Oregon Nat. Desert Ass’n v. McDaniel, 751 F. Supp. 2d 1151, 1159 (D. Or. 2011) \n(exceptional circumstances include evidence of administrative bias). Additionally, courts will \nconsider any issue that was “raised with sufficient clarity to allow the decision maker to understand \nand rule on the issue raised, whether the issue was considered sua sponte by the agency or was \nraised by someone other than the petitioning party.” Pac. Choice Seafood Co. v. Ross, 976 F.3d \n932, 942 (9th Cir. 2020). In short, “there is no bright-line standard as to when this requirement has \nbeen met.” Nat’l Parks & Conservation Ass’n v. Bureau of Land Mgmt., 606 F.3d 1058, 1065 (9th \nCir. 2010). Finally, “[a]dministrative remedies  that are inadequate need not be exhausted.” \nCoit Indep. Joint Venture v. Fed. Sav. & Loan Ins.

Contrary to Public Policy \nJudicial  review  of  Plaintiffs’  unexhausted  claims  is  appropriate  for  several  reasons. \nFirst, Defendants’ alleged violation of the Comstock Act would be “contrary to an important public \npolicy.” Myron, 670 F.2d at 52. As a case Defendants rely upon explains, the word “abortion” in \nthe statute “indicates a national policy of discountenancing abortion as inimical to the national \n28 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 137   Filed 04/07/23    Page 29 of 67   PageID 4451\nlife.” See Bours, 229 F. at 964; ECF No. 28-1 at 206. And twenty-two states filed an amicus brief \narguing  FDA’s  decision  to  permit  mail-in  chemical  abortion  harms  the  public  interest  by \nundermining states’ ability to enforce laws regulating abortion.21 ECF No. 100 at 17.  \nb.  Individual Injustice and Irreparable Injury \nSecond, the  agency’s  actions  are  “likely  to  result  in  individual  injustice”  or  cause \n“irreparable injury.” Myron, 670 F.2d at 52; Dawson, 504 F.3d at 606. Plaintiffs allege “many \nintense side effects” and “significant complications requiring medical attention” resulting from \nDefendants’ actions.22 ECF No. 7 at 13. Many women also experience intense psychological \ntrauma and post-traumatic stress from excessive bleeding and from seeing the remains of their \naborted children. See ECF No. 96 at 25–29; Pauline Slade et al., Termination of pregnancy: \nPatient’s perception of care, J. OF FAMILY PLANNING & REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE Vol. 27, \nNo. 2, 72–77 (2001) (“Seeing the foetus, in general, appears to be a difficult aspect of the medical \ntermination process which can be distressing, bring home the reality of the event and may influence \nlater emotional adaptation.”). Parenthetically, said “individual justice” and “irreparable injury” \nanalysis also arguably applies to the unborn humans extinguished by mifepristone — especially in \n \n21 See David S. Cohen et al., Abortion Pills, 76 STAN. L. REV. 1, 9 (forthcoming 2024) (“Despite state laws, mailed \nmedication abortion can cross borders in ways that undermine state laws . . . A new organization, Mayday Health, \nfor example, focuses on those who live in states with abortion bans, giving users step-by-step instructions on how to \nset up temporary addresses in an abortion permissive state and forward the mail into the banned state.”) (internal \nmarks omitted).  \n \n22 At least 4,213 adverse events from chemical abortion drugs have been reported. See ECF No. 96 at 12 n.16. \nBut the actual number is likely far higher because non-fatal adverse events are no longer required to be reported, and \nbecause more than 60 percent of women and girls’ emergency room visits after chemical abortions are miscoded as \nmiscarriages. See James Studnicki et al., A Post Hoc Exploratory Analysis: Induced Complications Mistaken for \nMiscarriage in the Emergency Room are a Risk Factor for Hospitalization, 9 HEALTH SERV. RSCH. MGMT. \nEPIDEMIOLOGY 1, 1 (2022); see also ECF No. 1-8 at 7 (describing Plaintiffs’ difficulty in submitting adverse event \nreports to mifepristone manufacturer Danco). Other data sources such as the Center for Disease Control and \nPrevention Abortion Surveillance Reports are “profoundly flawed” because state reporting “is voluntary, with many \nstates reporting intermittently and some not at all.” Studnicki et al., supra note 9, at 2. One Plaintiff physician \nalleges that when she reported an adverse event to her state’s health department, the “report was rejected because the \nState said it was not a ‘true’ adverse event because the patient ultimately recovered.” ECF No. 1-10 at 7.  \n29 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 137   Filed 04/07/23    Page 30 of 67   PageID 4452\nthe post-Dobbs era. See Dobbs, 142 S. Ct. at 2261 (“Nothing in the Constitution or in our Nation’s \nlegal traditions authorizes the Court to adopt [the] theory of life” that States are required “to regard \na fetus as lacking even the most basic human right — to live — at least until an arbitrary point in \na  pregnancy  has  passed.”)  (internal  marks  omitted);  Brief  of  Amici  Curiae  Scholars  of \nJurisprudence John M. Finnis and Robert P. George in Support of Petitioners, Dobbs, 142 S. Ct. \n2228 (2022) (arguing unborn humans are constitutional “persons” entitled to equal protection).  \nc.  Administrative Procedures are Inadequate \nThird, FDA’s combined response time of over sixteen years to Plaintiffs’ two petitions \nshows their procedures have been inadequate. See Coit, 489 U.S. at 587; Bowen v. City of New \nYork, 476 U.S. 467, 476 (1986) (“[T]he harm imposed by exhaustion would be irreparable.”).               \nFDA slow-walked — or rather, snail-walked — its response to the 2002 Petition by waiting nearly \nfourteen  years  to  deny  the  petition.  ECF  No.  7  at  9.  Requiring  Plaintiffs  to  exhaust  their \nadministrative remedies may equate to another decade-plus of waiting for the agency to give them \nthe time of day. \nd.  Exhaustion would be Futile \nAlternatively, any attempt by Plaintiffs to challenge Defendants’ actions would likely be \nfutile. Even if Plaintiffs did not endure sixteen years of delay, dawdle, and dithering, their efforts \nwould  surely  “be  futile  because  the  administrative  agency  will  clearly  reject  the  claim.” \nGulf Restoration Network, 683 F.3d at 176. “President Biden has emphasized the need to protect \naccess to mifepristone” since the day of the Supreme Court’s decision in Dobbs.23 President Biden \nstated  that  “protecting  reproductive  rights  is  essential  to  our  Nation’s  health,  safety,  and \n \n23 See FACT SHEET: President Biden to Sign Memorandum on Ensuring Safe Access to Medication Abortion, \nTHE WHITE HOUSE (Jan. 22, 2023), https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/01/22/fact-\nsheet-president-biden-to-sign-presidential-memorandum-on-ensuring-safe-access-to-medication-abortion/. \n \n30 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 137   Filed 04/07/23    Page 31 of 67   PageID 4453\nprogress.”24 He also criticized States’ efforts to impose restrictions on mifepristone because such \nefforts “have stoked confusion, sowed fear, and may prevent patients from accessing safe and \neffective FDA-approved medication.”25 Thus, it is unlikely FDA would reverse course on its \n“mail-order” abortion regimen. ECF No. 7 at 7. Defendants’ position on the Comstock Act in this \nlitigation only confirms that fact. See ECF No. 28 at 38 (“Plaintiffs misconstrue the Comstock \nAct.”).26 \ne.  The Comstock Act was raised with Sufficient Clarity \nFinally, the Comstock Act issue was “raised with sufficient clarity.” Ross, 976 F.3d at 942. \nThis is because: (1) the 2019 Petition requested FDA to retain the in-person requirement for \ndispensing of chemical abortion drugs; and (2) the Comstock Act issue was also raised by the \nUnited States Postal Service and the Department of Health & Human Services on July 1, 2022, \n“[i]n the wake of” Dobbs.27 The Office of Legal Counsel specifically mentioned FDA’s regimen \nfor chemical abortion drugs when concluding “the mere mailing of such drugs to a particular \njurisdiction is an insufficient basis for concluding that the sender intends them to be used \nunlawfully.” OLC Memo at *1. This shows not only that the issue was raised with sufficient \nclarity, but also the futility of raising the issue before the agency. Therefore, Plaintiffs’ failure to \nexhaust their claims does not preclude judicial review. \n \n24 Memorandum on Further Efforts to Protect Access to Reproductive Healthcare Services, THE WHITE HOUSE (Jan. \n22, 2023), https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2023/01/22/memorandum-on-further-\nefforts-to-protect-access-to-reproductive-healthcare-services/. \n \n25 Id.  \n \n26 The D.C. Circuit has hinted that the futility doctrine is ordinarily predicated on the “worthlessness of an argument \nbefore an agency that has rejected it in the past” rather than the likelihood that “the agency would reject it in the \nfuture.” Tesoro Refin. & Mktg. Co. v. FERC, 552 F.3d 868, 874 (D.C. Cir. 2009). But in this case, there is no \nprincipled distinction between the two scenarios. Defendants do not even pretend the agency might have accepted \nPlaintiffs’ arguments. Other cases may involve uncertainty about future agency rejection, but it is not this case.  \n \n27 See Application of the Comstock Act to the Mailing of Prescription Drugs That Can Be Used for Abortions, 2022 \nWL 18273906 (O.L.C.

Plaintiffs’ Challenges to FDA’s 2021 Actions Have a Substantial Likelihood of \nSuccess on the Merits \n \n“To satisfy the first element of likelihood of success on the merits,” Plaintiffs “must present \na prima facie case but need not show that [they are] certain to win.” Janvey v. Alguire¸ 647 F.3d \n585, 595–96 (5th Cir. 2011) (internal marks omitted). Under the APA, courts must “hold unlawful \nand set aside agency action, findings, and conclusions found to be . . . arbitrary, capricious, an \nabuse  of  discretion,  or  otherwise  not  in  accordance  with  law,”  or  “in  excess  of  statutory \njurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A) & (C). \nThe Court will first address FDA’s 2021 Actions that eliminated the in-person dispensing \nrequirement and announced that FDA would allow abortionists to dispense chemical abortion \ndrugs by mail or mail-order pharmacy. Plaintiffs have a substantial likelihood of success on their \nclaims that these actions violate federal law. \n1.  The Comstock Act prohibits the Mailing of Chemical Abortion Drugs \nThe Comstock Act declares “[e]very obscene, lewd, lascivious, indecent, filthy or vile \narticle, matter, thing, device, or substance” to be “nonmailable matter” that “shall not be conveyed \nin the mails or delivered from any post office or by any letter carrier.” 18 U.S.C. § 1461. The next \nclauses declare nonmailable “[e]very article or thing designed, adapted, or intended for producing \nabortion, or for any indecent or immoral use; and [e]very article, instrument, substance, drug, \nmedicine, or thing which is advertised or described in a manner calculated to lead another to use \nor apply it for producing abortion, or for any indecent or immoral purpose.” Id. Similarly, Section \n1462 forbids the use of “any express company or other common carrier” to transport chemical \nabortion drugs “in interstate or foreign commerce.” \nDefendants’ argument that the Comstock Act does not prohibit the mailing of chemical \nabortion drugs relies on the “reenactment canon.” That is, courts may distill a statute’s meaning \n32 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 137   Filed 04/07/23    Page 33 of 67   PageID 4455\nwhen “federal courts of appeals settled upon a consensus view” and “Congress never modified the \nrelevant  statutory  text  to  reject  or  displace  this  settled  construction.”  ECF  No.  28  at  39. \nThis purported “consensus view” is that the Comstock Act does not prohibit the mailing of items \ndesigned to produce abortions “where the sender does not intend them to be used unlawfully.” Id. \nThis argument is unpersuasive for several reasons.  \n“Congress is presumed to be aware of an administrative or judicial interpretation of a \nstatute and to adopt that interpretation when it re-enacts a statute without change.” Lorillard v. \nPons, 434 U.S. 575, 580 (1978). But “[t]here is an obvious trump to the reenactment argument”: \n“‘[w]here the law is plain, subsequent reenactment does not constitute an adoption of a previous \nadministrative construction.’” Brown v. Gardner, 513 U.S. 115, 121 (1994) (quoting Demarest v. \nManspeaker, 498 U.S. 184, 190 (1991)); see also Milner v. Dep’t of Navy, 562 U.S. 562, 576 \n(2011) (“[W]e have no warrant to ignore clear statutory language on the ground that other courts \nhave done so.”). Additionally, the presumption only applies when the judicial or administrative \ngloss “represented settled law when Congress reenacted the [language in question].” Keene Corp. \nv. United States, 508 U.S. 200, 212 (1993); see also Jama v. Immigr. & Customs Enf’t, 543 U.S. \n335, 349 (2005) (presumption applies only when the supposed judicial consensus at the time of \nreenactment was “so broad and unquestioned that we must presume Congress knew of and \nendorsed it”); Davis v. United States, 495 U.S. 472, 482 (1990); Fed. Deposit Ins. Corp. v. Phila. \nGear Corp., 476 U.S. 426, 437 (1986); United States v. Powell, 379 U.S. 48, 55 n.13 (1964).28 \n \n28 See also ANTONIN SCALIA & BRYAN A. GARNER, READING LAW: THE INTERPRETATION OF LEGAL TEXTS 325 \n(2012) (“But how numerous must the lower-court opinions be, or how prominent and long-standing the \nadministrative interpretation, to justify the level of lawyerly reliance that justifies the canon? What about two \nintermediate-court decisions? (We doubt it — though some cases have relied on just a single intermediate-court \ndecision.) Or seven courts of first instance? (Perhaps.)”). \n33 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 137   Filed 04/07/23    Page 34 of 67   PageID 4456\nThe canon is easily overcome for one simple reason: it is a dubious means of ascertaining \ncongressional intent. “There are plenty of reasons to reenact a statute that have nothing to do with \ncodifying the glosses that courts have already put on the statute.” CALEB NELSON, STATUTORY \nINTERPRETATION 481 (2011). For example, perhaps the original statute contained a “sunset” \nprovision. Maybe Congress wanted to change the statute in some other respects but found it easier \nto communicate those changes by reenacting a modified version of the complete statute “than by \ncasting each discrete change as an amendment to the existing language.” Id. at n.14. Or Congress \nwas perhaps conducting “a more general codification or reorganization of the statutes in a \nparticular field, for the sake of making the structure of its statutes easier to follow.” Id. “Or maybe \nCongress simply wanted to enact the relevant title of the United States Code into positive law.” Id. \n“To the extent that Congress reenacts statutory language for one of those other reasons, members \nof Congress may well not mean to be expressing any view at all about the glosses that have piled \nup in the meantime.” Id.; see also HENRY M. HART, JR., & ALBERT M. SACKS, THE LEGAL \nPROCESS: BASIC PROBLEMS IN THE MAKING AND APPLICATION OF LAW 1367 (William N. Eskridge, \nJr., & Philip P. Frickey eds., 1994) (tent. ed. 1958) (criticizing the canon for adding to the costs of \nthe legislative process in counterproductive ways). \nHere, the plain text of the Comstock Act controls. See Bostock v. Clayton Cnty., Ga., 140 \nS. Ct. 1731, 1749 (2020) (“[W]hen the meaning of the statute’s terms is plain, our job is at an \nend.”); Lawson v. FMR LLC, 571 U.S. 429, 441 (2014) (“Absent any textual qualification, we \npresume the operative language means what it appears to mean.”). The Comstock Act declares \n“nonmailable” every “article, instrument, substance, drug, medicine, or thing which is advertised \nor described in a manner calculated to lead another to use it or apply it for producing abortion.” \n18 U.S.C. § 1461 (emphasis added). It is indisputable that chemical abortion drugs are both \n34 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 137   Filed 04/07/23    Page 35 of 67   PageID 4457\n“drug[s]” and are “for producing abortion.” Therefore, federal criminal law declares they are \n“nonmailable.” See Texas v. Becerra, No. 5:22-CV-185-H, 2022 WL 3639525, at *26 n.21 (N.D. \nTex. Aug. 23, 2022) (“[F]ederal law bar[s] the importation or delivery of any device or medicine \ndesigned to produce an abortion.”).  \nThe statute plainly does not require intent on the part of the seller that the drugs be used \n“unlawfully.” To be sure, the statute does contain a catch-all provision that prohibits the mailing \nof such things “for producing abortion, or for any indecent or immoral purpose.” 18 U.S.C. § 1461 \n(emphasis added). But “or” is “almost always disjunctive.” Encino Motorcars, LLC v. Navarro, \n138 S. Ct. 1134, 1141 (2018) (internal marks omitted). Additionally, the “or” in Section 1461 is \npreceded by a comma, further disjoining the list of nonmailable matter. Thus, the Court does not \nread the “or” as an “and.” Similarly, the Act requires that the defendant “knowingly uses the mails \nfor the mailing” of anything declared by the Act “to be nonmailable.” 18 U.S.C. § 1461. A \ndefendant could satisfy this mens rea requirement by mailing mifepristone and knowing it is for \nproducing abortion. The statute does not require anything more. See, e.g., United States v. Lamott, \n831 F.3d 1153, 1157 (9th Cir. 2016) (where Congress “intends to legislate a specific intent crime,” \nthe statute typically uses the phrase “with the intent to”) (internal marks omitted). \nEven  if  the  statute  were  ambiguous,  the  legislative  history  also  supports  this \ninterpretation.29 See H.R. Rep. No. 91-1105, at 2 (1970) (“Existing statutes completely prohibit \nthe importation, interstate transportation, and mailing of contraceptive materials, or the mailing of \nadvertisement or information concerning how or where such contraceptives may be obtained or \nhow conception may be prevented.”). Congress unsuccessfully tried to modify Section 1461 to \n \n29 This Court reviews the legislative history as mere evidence of the ordinary public meaning of the current statutory \nlanguage. See ANTONIN SCALIA, A MATTER OF INTERPRETATION 17 (1997) (“It is the law that governs, not the intent \nof the lawgiver . . . Men may intend what they will; but it is only the laws that they enact which bind us.”). \n35 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 137   Filed 04/07/23    Page 36 of 67   PageID 4458\nprohibit mailing drugs “intended by the offender . . . to be used to produce an illegal abortion.” \nSee REP. OF THE SUBCOMM. ON CRIM. JUST., 95TH CONG., REP. ON RECODIFICATION OF FED. CRIM. \nLAW 40 (Comm. Print 1978) (emphasis added); Bostock, 140 S. Ct. at 1824 (Kavanaugh, J., \ndissenting) (“In the face of the unsuccessful legislative efforts . . . judges may not rewrite the law \nsimply because of their own policy views.”).30 In fact, the House Subcommittee Report on the \nproposed amendment acknowledged the plain meaning of the statute: “[U]nder current law, the \noffender commits an offense whenever he ‘knowingly’ mails any of the designated abortion \nmaterials,” and the proposed amendment would “require proof that the offender specifically \nintended that the mailed materials be used to produce an illegal abortion.”31 If Congress believed \nthe statute already contained the “intentionality” requirement gloss in prior reenactments, there is \nlittle reason why Congress would amend the provision to include that requirement. \nDefendants aver Plaintiffs’ interpretation of the Comstock Act is foreclosed by the Food \nand Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 (“FDAAA”) for one reason: “Congress was \nwell aware that it was directing mifepristone’s preexisting distribution scheme to continue” in \nenacting the FDAAA. ECF No. 28 at 40. But neither “critics [of FDA’s 2000 Approval of \nmifepristone]  nor  anyone  else  in  the  congressional  debate  mentioned  the  Comstock  Act.” \nOLC Memo at *7 n.18; see also In re Lively, 717 F.3d 406, 410 (5th Cir. 2013) (“Repeals by \nimplication are disfavored and will not be presumed unless the legislature’s intent is ‘clear and \nmanifest.’”) (internal marks omitted). Because the Comstock Act is not even implicitly mentioned \n \n30 Bostock’s majority opinion warns that “speculation about why a later Congress declined to adopt new legislation \noffers a ‘particularly dangerous’ basis on which to rest an interpretation of an existing law a different and earlier \nCongress did adopt.” 140 S. Ct. at 1747. But the opinion does not suggest judges can “rewrite the law.” Instead, \nBostock’s stated rationale was that the disputed term was implicit in the statutory text all along. No such “textualist” \nanalysis could plausibly justify Defendants’ interpretation of the Comstock Act, and Defendants offer none. \n \n31 REP. OF THE SUBCOMM. ON CRIM. JUST., 95TH CONG., REP. ON RECODIFICATION OF FED. CRIM. LAW 40 (Comm. \nPrint 1978) (emphasis added). \n36 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 137   Filed 04/07/23    Page 37 of 67   PageID 4459\nin the FDAAA’s enactment, there is no repeal by implication. And in any case, Defendants’ \narguments based on legislative history cannot overcome clear statutory text.  \nConsequently, reenactment of the Comstock Act does not constitute an adoption of prior \nconstructions because “the law is plain.” Brown, 513 U.S. at 121 (1994). Even if that were not the \ncase, the reenactment canon does not apply here because the relevant judicial glosses do not \nrepresent a “broad and unquestioned” consensus. Jama, 543 U.S. at 349. Defendants rely heavily \non the OLC Memo that purports to establish this “consensus.” But none of the cases cited in the \nOLC Memo support the view that the Comstock Act bars the mailing of abortion drugs only when \nthe sender has the specific intent that the drugs be used unlawfully.  \nOn the contrary, the Seventh Circuit reasoned that the word “abortion” in the context of \nthe Act indicates “a national policy of discountenancing abortion as inimical to the national life.” \nBours, 229 F. at 964. Bours further declared “it is immaterial what the local statutory definition of \nabortion is, what acts of abortion are included, or what excluded.” Id. Similarly, the Sixth Circuit’s \ndecision in Davis v. United States only suggests that legitimate uses of drugs should not fall within \nthe scope of the statute “merely because they are capable of illegal uses.” 62 F.2d 473, 474 (6th \nCir. 1933). In other words, the Davis holding reflects the position that legitimate uses — uses \nbeyond the purposes the statute condemns — should be excluded from the scope of the statute, not \nthat whatever uses are lawful under state law should be. ECF No. 114 at 10. Likewise, the Second \nCircuit interpreted the statute to embrace articles the 1873 Congress “would have denounced as \nimmoral if it had understood all the conditions under which they were to be used.” United States \nv. One Package, 86 F.2d 737, 739 (2d Cir. 1936). The court further observed that “[t]he word \n‘unlawful’ would make this clear as to articles for producing abortion.” Id.; see also James S. \nWitherspoon,  Reexamining  Roe:  Nineteenth-Century  Abortion  Statutes  and  the  Fourteenth \n37 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 137   Filed 04/07/23    Page 38 of 67   PageID 4460\nAmendment, 17 ST. MARY’S L.J. 29, 33 (1985) (explaining that thirty of thirty-seven states had \nstatutory abortion prohibitions in 1868 — just five years before Congress enacted the Comstock \nAct). \nDefendants maintain “the legality of the agency actions needs to be judged at the time of \nthe decision, all of which occurred when Roe and Casey were still good law.” ECF No. 136 at 109. \nEven assuming that is true in all cases, Roe did not prohibit all restrictions on abortions. And it is \nnot obvious that enforcement of the Comstock Act post-Casey would have necessarily run afoul \nof Casey’s “arbitrary ‘undue burden’ test.” Dobbs, 142 S. Ct. at 2266. Therefore, there is no reason \nwhy the Act should not have at least been considered. In any case, the Comstock Act plainly \nforecloses mail-order abortion in the present, and Defendants have stated no present or future \nintention of complying with the law. Defendants cannot immunize the illegality of their actions by \npointing to a small window in the past where those actions might have been legal. \nIn sum, the reenactment canon is inapplicable here because the law is plain. Even if that \nwere not true, the cases relied on in the OLC Memo do not support Defendants’ interpretation. \nAnd even if they did, a small handful of cases cannot constitute the “broad and unquestioned” \nconsensus required under the reenactment canon. Therefore, Plaintiffs have a substantial likelihood \nof prevailing on their claim that Defendants’ decision to allow the dispensing of chemical abortion \ndrugs through mail violates unambiguous federal criminal law.  \n2.  FDA’s 2021 Actions violate the Administrative Procedure Act \n  Because FDA’s 2021 Actions violate the Comstock Act, they are “otherwise not in \naccordance with law.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). Additionally, the actions were likely “arbitrary and \ncapricious.” Id. FDA relied on FDA Adverse Event Reporting System data despite the agency’s \n2016 decision to eliminate the requirement for abortionists to report non-fatal “adverse events.” \n38 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 137   Filed 04/07/23    Page 39 of 67   PageID 4461\nECF No. 7 at 25. Defendants maintain that “Plaintiffs offer no explanation for why it was \nimpermissible to rely on the reported data.” ECF No. 28 at 33. The explanation should be obvious \n— it is circular and self-serving to practically eliminate an “adverse event” reporting requirement \nand then point to a low number of “adverse events” as a justification for removing even more \nrestrictions than were already omitted in 2000 and 2016. In other words, it is a predetermined \nconclusion in search of non-data — a database designed to produce a null set. But even if FDA’s \nexplanation were well-reasoned, the actions would still run afoul of the Comstock Act and \ntherefore violate the APA.  \nD.  Plaintiffs’ Challenges to FDA’s Pre-2021 Actions Have a Substantial Likelihood             \nof Success on the Merits \n \n1.  FDA’s 2000 Approval violated Subpart H \nIn 1992, FDA issued regulations “needed to assure safe use” of new drugs designed to treat \nlife-threatening diseases like HIV and cancer. See 57 Fed. Reg. 58,942, 58,958 (Dec. 11, 1992) \n(codified at 21 C.F.R. § 314.520). Subpart H — titled “Accelerated Approval of New Drugs for \nSerious or Life-Threatening Illnesses” — applies to drugs that satisfy two requirements. First, the \ndrug must have been “studied for [its] safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening \nillnesses.” 21 C.F.R. § 314.500. And second, the drug must “provide [a] meaningful therapeutic \nbenefit to patients over existing treatments.” Id. “These rules were promulgated by FDA . . . as \npart of an attempt to correct perceived deficiencies in FDA’s approval process made apparent by \nthe need to quickly develop drugs for HIV/AIDS patients.” ECF No. 1-13 at 20. \n  “When FDA originally approved Mifeprex, the agency relied upon Subpart H to place \ncertain restrictions on the manufacturer’s distribution of the drug product to assure its safe use.” \nECF No. 28 at 14; see also ECF No. 1-13 at 9 (the American Medical Association explained that \n“[Mifepristone] poses a severe risk to patients unless the drug is administered as part of a complete \n39 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 137   Filed 04/07/23    Page 40 of 67   PageID 4462\ntreatment plan under the supervision of a physician”). Thus, to satisfy Subpart H, FDA deemed \npregnancy a “serious or life-threatening illness[]” and concluded that mifepristone “provide[d] [a] \nmeaningful therapeutic benefit to patients over existing treatments.” See 21 C.F.R. §§ 314.500; \n314.560. FDA was wrong on both counts.  \na.  Pregnancy is not an “Illness” \n  Pregnancy is a normal physiological state most women experience one or more times \nduring  their  childbearing  years  —  a  natural  process  essential  to  perpetuating  human  life. \nDefendants even admit pregnancy is not an “illness.” FDA claims the Final Rule explained Subpart \nH was available for serious or life-threatening “conditions,” whether or not they were understood \ncolloquially to be “illnesses.” ECF No. 28 at 36. But the Final Rule says no such thing. “One \ncomment asserted that neither depression nor psychosis is a disease, nor is either one serious or \nlife-threatening.” 57 Fed. Reg. 58,946. FDA responded to the comment that “signs of these \ndiseases are readily studied” and that its reference to depression and psychosis “was intended to \ngive examples of conditions or diseases that can be serious for certain populations or in some or \nall of their phases.” Id. In other words, FDA’s response to this comment was not that depression \nand psychosis qualify because they are “conditions” even though they are not  colloquially \nunderstood as “illnesses.” Rather, FDA simply disagreed with the comment’s characterization of \nthese conditions and explained that they were examples of “diseases” that can be “serious.” \nNothing in the Final Rule supports the interpretation that pregnancy is a serious or life-threatening \nillness.  \nFDA’s 2016 Denial of the 2002 Petition is similarly unpersuasive. For example, FDA noted \nthat approximately fifty percent of pregnancies in the United States are unintended and that \nunintended pregnancies may cause depression and anxiety. ECF No. 1-28 at 5. But categorizing \n40 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 137   Filed 04/07/23    Page 41 of 67   PageID 4463\ncomplications or negative psychological experiences arising from pregnancy as “illnesses” is \nmaterially different than classifying pregnancy itself as a serious or life-threatening illness per se. \nTellingly, FDA never explains how or why a “condition” would not qualify as a “serious or life-\nthreatening illness.” Suppose that a woman experiences depression because of lower back pain \nthat inhibits her mobility. Under FDA’s reading, a new drug used to treat lower back pain — which \ncan cause depression, just like unplanned pregnancy — could obtain accelerated approval under \nSubpart H.  \nDefendants cite zero cases reading Subpart H like FDA reads Subpart H. On the contrary, \ncourts have read “serious or life-threatening illnesses” to mean what it says. See, e.g., Tummino v. \nHamburg, 936 F. Supp. 2d 162, 182 (E.D.N.Y. 2013) (“Whether an illness is ‘serious or life-\nthreatening’ ‘is based on its impact on such factors as survival, day-to-day functioning, or the \nlikelihood that the disease, if left untreated, will progress from a less severe condition to a more \nserious one.’”) (quoting 57 Fed. Reg. at 13235). The preamble to the final rule also clarified the \nterms “would be used as FDA has defined them in the past.” 57 Fed. Reg. at 13235.  \nLikewise, the Final Rule expressly stated this nomenclature “is the same as FDA defined \nand used the terms” in two rulemakings: the first in 1987; the second in 1988. 57 Fed. Reg. at \n58,945. In the 1988 rulemaking, FDA defined “life-threatening” to include diseases or conditions \n“where the likelihood of death is high unless the course of the disease is interrupted (e.g., AIDS \nand cancer), as well as diseases or conditions with potentially fatal outcomes where the end point \nof clinical trial analysis is survival (e.g., increased survival in persons who have had a stroke or \nheart attack).” See 53 Fed. Reg. at 41517; id. at 41516 (referencing “AIDS, cancer, Parkinson’s \ndisease, and other serious conditions”); CSX Transp., Inc. v. Ala. Dep’t of Revenue, 562 U.S. 277, \n294 (2011) (the canon of ejusdem generis “limits general terms that follow specific ones to matters \n41 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 137   Filed 04/07/23    Page 42 of 67   PageID 4464\nsimilar to those specified”) (internal marks omitted). Therefore, “diseases” and “conditions” are \nused interchangeably, and even “conditions” must be “serious” or “life-threatening” as defined. \nFood and Drug scholars have understood Subpart H’s scope the same way. See, e.g., \nCharles Steenburg, The Food and Drug Administration’s Use of Postmarketing (Phase IV) Study \nRequirements: Exception to the Rule?, 61 FOOD & DRUG L.J. 295, 323 (2006) (Subpart H \n“extend[s] only to drugs and biological products that target[] ‘serious or life-threatening illnesses’ \nand offer[] a ‘meaningful’ benefit over existing treatments”). Even the Population Council argued \nto FDA that “the imposition of Subpart H is unlawful” because “[t]he plain meaning of these terms \ndoes not comprehend normal, everyday occurrences such as pregnancy and unwanted pregnancy.” \nECF No. 1-14 at 21. This reading is also consistent with the fact that aside from mifepristone, FDA \nhad approved fewer than forty NDAs under Subpart H by early 2002. See id. at 20. And of those \nother approvals, twenty were for the treatment of HIV and HIV-related diseases, nine were for the \ntreatment of various cancers and their symptoms, four were for severe bacterial infections, one \nwas for chronic hypertension, and one was for leprosy. Id. “One of these things is not like the \nothers, one of these things just doesn’t belong.” See Sesame Street.   \nb.  Defendants are not entitled to Auer Deference \n  Courts sometimes extend Auer deference “to agencies’ reasonable readings of genuinely \nambiguous regulations.” Kisor v. Wilkie, 139 S. Ct. 2400, 2408 (2019). Auer deference is rooted \nin an “always rebuttable” presumption “that Congress would generally want the agency to play the \nprimary role in resolving regulatory ambiguities.” Id. at 2412. “Auer deference is sometimes \nappropriate and sometimes not.” Id. at 2408. “First and foremost, a court should not afford Auer \ndeference unless the regulation is genuinely ambiguous.” Id. at 2415. “And before concluding that \na rule is genuinely ambiguous, a court must exhaust all the traditional tools of construction.” Id. \n42 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 137   Filed 04/07/23    Page 43 of 67   PageID 4465\n(internal marks omitted). “That means a court cannot wave the ambiguity flag just because it found \nthe regulation impenetrable on first read.” Id. If genuine ambiguity remains, the agency’s reading \nmust still be “reasonable.” Id. And even if the regulation is genuinely ambiguous, the agency’s \ninterpretation “must in some way implicate its substantive expertise.” Id. at 2417. Finally, an \nagency’s reading of a rule must reflect “fair and considered judgment” to receive Auer deference. \nId. (internal marks omitted). \n  Here, Auer deference is not appropriate because “the language of [the] regulation is plain \nand unambiguous.” McCann v. Unum Provident, 907 F.3d 130, 144 (3d Cir. 2018). As explained, \nFDA’s definitions in prior rulemakings foreclose its interpretation of Subpart H. If there is any \nambiguity in “serious or life-threatening illnesses,” the ordinary meaning principle resolves that \nambiguity. See Bostock, 140 S. Ct. at 1825 (Kavanaugh, J, dissenting) (“The ordinary meaning \nprinciple  is  longstanding  and  well  settled.”).  “[C]ommon parlance  matters  in  assessing  the \nordinary meaning” of a statute or regulation “because courts heed how most people would have \nunderstood the text.” Id. at 1828 (internal marks omitted). The word “illness” refers to “poor \nhealth;  sickness,”  or  “a  specific  sickness  or  disease,  or  an  instance  of  such.”32  Merriam-\nWebster invokes the definition for “sickness” — “an unhealthy condition of body or mind.”33 \nLikewise, a Wikipedia search for “illness” re-directs to the entry for “Disease,” which is defined \nas “a particular abnormal condition that negatively affects the structure or function of all or part \nof an organism, and that is not immediately due to any external injury.”34 Pregnancy, on the other \n \n32 Illness, Dictionary.com, https://www.dictionary.com/browse/illness (last visited Mar. 22, 2023); see also \nBostock,140 S. Ct. at 1766 (Alito, J, dissenting) (“Dictionary definitions are valuable because they are evidence of \nwhat people at the time of a statute’s enactment would have understood its words to mean.”). \n \n33 Illness, Merriam-Webster.com, https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/illness (last visited Mar. 22, 2023). \n \n34 Disease, Wikipedia, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease (emphasis added) (last visited Mar. 22, 2023). \n \n43 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 137   Filed 04/07/23    Page 44 of 67   PageID 4466\nhand, is defined as “the time during which one or more offspring develops (gestates) inside a \nwoman’s uterus (womb).”35  \nMost readers would not define pregnancy to be a serious or life-threatening illness. \nEven FDA  does  not  earnestly  defend  that  position.  True,  complications  can  arise  during \npregnancy, and said complications can be serious or life-threatening. But that does not make \npregnancy itself an illness. See ECF No 1-13 at 21. And even if the regulation were genuinely \nambiguous  after  exhausting  all  traditional  tools  of  statutory  construction,  Defendants’ \ninterpretation: (1) is not reasonable; (2) does not implicate their substantive expertise; and (3) does \nnot  reflect  fair  and  considered  judgment.  Accordingly, Defendants  are  not  entitled  to  Auer \ndeference on their interpretations of “serious or life-threatening illnesses.” By interpreting Subpart \nH’s scope as reaching any state or side effect that can be considered an undefined “condition,” \nDefendants broaden the regulation on accelerated approval of new drugs farther than the text of \nthe regulation would ever suggest. Therefore, FDA’s approval of chemical abortion drugs under \nSubpart H exceeded its authority under the regulation’s first requirement. \nc.  Chemical Abortion Drugs do not provide a “Meaningful Therapeutic Benefit” \nFDA also exceeded its authority under the second requirement of Subpart H. In addition to \ntreating  a  serious  or  life-threatening  illness,  chemical  abortion  drugs  must  also  provide  a \n“meaningful  therapeutic  benefit”  to  patients  over  surgical  abortion.  21  C.F.R.  § 314.500. \nAs explained, this cannot be the case because chemical abortion drugs do not treat “serious or life-\nthreatening illnesses” — a prerequisite to reaching the second requirement. Id. Similarly, chemical \nabortion drugs cannot be “therapeutic” because the word relates to the treatment or curing of \ndisease.36 But even putting that aside, chemical abortion drugs do not provide a meaningful \n \n35 Pregnancy, Wikipedia, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy (last visited Mar. 22, 2023). \n36 Therapeutic, Dictionary.com, https://www.dictionary.com/browse/illness (last visited Mar. 28, 2023). \n44 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 137   Filed 04/07/23    Page 45 of 67   PageID 4467\ntherapeutic benefit over surgical abortion. See 21 C.F.R. § 314.500 (examples include where the \nbenefit is the “ability to treat patients unresponsive to, or intolerant of, available therapy, or \nimproved patient response over available therapy”). To the extent surgical abortion can be \nconsidered a “therapy,” the clinical trials did not compare chemical abortion with surgical abortion \nto find such a benefit. ECF No. 1 at 44.  \nDefendants argue just one “meaningful therapeutic benefit”: chemical abortion drugs \navoided “an invasive surgical procedure and anesthesia in 92 percent of” patients in the trial. ECF \nNo. 28 at 37. But “[b]y defining the ‘therapeutic benefit’ solely as the avoidance of the current \nstandard of care’s delivery mechanism, FDA effectively guarantees that a drug will satisfy this \nsecond prong of Subpart H as long as it represents a different method of therapy.” ECF No. 1-14 \nat 22. And even if that were a benefit, chemical abortions are over fifty percent more likely than \nsurgical abortion to result in an emergency room visit within thirty days. ECF No. 7 at 21.37 \nConsequently, the number of chemical abortion-related emergency room visits increased by over \nfive hundred percent between 2002 and 2015. ECF No. 1 at 19.  \nOne study revealed the overall incidence of adverse events is “fourfold higher” in chemical \nabortions when compared to surgical abortions.38 Women who underwent chemical abortions also \nexperienced  far  higher  rates  of  hemorrhaging,  incomplete  abortion,  and  unplanned  surgical \nevacuation.39 Chemical abortion patients “reported significantly higher levels of pain, nausea, \n \n37 Some studies report that the exact number is fifty-three percent. See Studnicki et al., supra note 22.  \n \n38 See Maarit Niinimäki et al., Immediate Complications After Medical Compared with Surgical Termination of \nPregnancy, 114 OBSTETRICS & GYNECOLOGY 795 (2009). FDA agrees with this study but finds it “not surprising” \ngiven that chemical abortion “is associated with longer uterine bleeding.” ECF No. 1-44 at 38. See also ECF No 1-\n13 at 15, n.68–72 (collecting studies demonstrating the far higher rates of adverse events in chemical abortion over \nsurgical abortion).  \n \n39 Id. \n \n45 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 137   Filed 04/07/23    Page 46 of 67   PageID 4468\nvomiting and diarrhea during the actual abortion than did surgical patients . . . Post-abortion pain \noccurred in 77.1% of mifepristone patients compared with only 10.5% of surgical patients.” \nECF No 1-13 at 24. And before the approval, an FDA medical officer recognized the “medical \nregimen had more adverse events, particularly bleeding, than did surgical abortion. Failure rates \nexceeded those for surgical abortion . . . This is a serious potential disadvantage of the medical \nmethod.” Id. at 23 (emphasis added).  \nOther studies show eighty-three percent of women report that chemical abortion “changed” \nthem —  and  seventy-seven  percent  of  those  women  reported  a  negative  change.40  Thirty-\neight percent of women reported issues with anxiety, depression, drug abuse, and suicidal thoughts \nbecause of the chemical abortion.41 Bleeding from a chemical abortion, unlike surgical abortion, \ncan last up to several weeks.42 And the mother seeing the aborted human “appears to be a difficult \naspect of the medical termination process which can be distressing, bring home the reality of the \nevent and may influence later emotional adaptation.”43 “For example, one woman was surprised \nand saddened to see that her aborted baby ‘had a head, hands, and legs’ with ‘[d]efined fingers and \ntoes.’” ECF No. 1 at 21. The entire abortion process takes place within the mother’s home, without \nphysician oversight, potentially leading to undetected ectopic pregnancies, failure of rH factor \nincompatibility detection, and misdiagnosis of gestational age — all leading to severe or even fatal \n \n40 See Katherine A.

Contrary to popular belief and talking points, the \nevidence shows chemical abortion is not “as easy as taking Advil.” Id. at 20.  \nCompelling evidence suggests the statistics provided by FDA on the adverse effects of \nchemical abortion understate the negative impact the chemical abortion regimen has on women \nand girls. When women seek emergency care after receiving the chemical abortion pills, the \nabortionist  that  prescribed  the  drugs  is  usually  not  the  provider  to  manage  the  mother’s \ncomplications.44 Consequently, the treating physician may not know the adverse event is due to \nmifepristone. Id. at 13. Studies support this conclusion by finding over sixty percent of women and \ngirls’ emergency room visits after chemical abortions are miscoded as “miscarriages” rather than \nadverse  effects  to  mifepristone.45  Simply  put,  FDA’s  data  are  incomplete  and  potentially \nmisleading, as are the statistics touted by mifepristone advocates.  \nLastly, chemical  abortion  does  not  “treat  patients  unresponsive  to,  or  intolerant  of, \navailable therapy.” See 21 C.F.R. § 314.500. “To the contrary, because ‘medical abortion failures \nshould be managed with surgical termination’ the option for surgical abortion must be available \nfor any Mifeprex patient.” ECF No. 1-14 at 23 (quoting the Mifeprex “Warnings” label). One study \nshowed that 18.3 percent of women required surgical intervention after the chemical abortion \nregimen failed. Id. Hence, “any patient who would be intolerant of surgical abortion, if such a class \nof patients exists, cannot use the Mifeprex Regimen.” Id. at 24. On balance, the data reflect little \nto no benefit over surgical abortion — much less a “meaningful therapeutic” benefit.  \n \n44 Kathi Aultman et al., Deaths and Severe Adverse Events after the use of Mifepristone as an Abortifacient from \nSeptember 2000 to February 2019, 36 ISSUES IN LAW & MED., 3–26 (2021). \n \n45 Studnicki et al., supra note 9. \n47 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 137   Filed 04/07/23    Page 48 of 67   PageID 4470\nd.  Defendants’ Misapplication of Subpart H has not been Cured by Congress \n \nDefendants contend “Plaintiffs’ arguments about Subpart H have been overtaken by \ncongressional action.” ECF No. 28 at 35. In the FDAAA, “Congress specifically directed” that \ndrugs with elements to assure safe use “in effect on the effective date on this Act” would be \n“deemed to have in effect an approved” REMS. Id. (citing Pub. L. No. 110-85, § 909(b)(1)). \nBut the sponsors of such drugs were also required to submit a proposed REMS within 180 days. \nSee Pub. L. No. 110-85, § 909(b)(3). Hence, Congress “deemed” preexisting safety requirements \nto be a sufficient REMS until a new REMS was approved. The FDAAA did not affect, however, \nwhether an NDA was properly approved or authorized under Subpart H in the first place. \nRather, the FDAAA required that such drugs needed continued restrictions in place to mitigate \nrisks. Implementation of a REMS under the FDAAA does not somehow repeal or supplant the \napproval process under Subpart H or 21 U.S.C. § 355(d). The FDAAA only eased the regulatory \ntransition from Subpart H to the REMS provision. Simply stated, Congress’s general reiteration \nthat dangerous drugs should carry a REMS did not codify FDA’s specific approval of the \nmifepristone NDA. It did not consider the chemical abortion approval at all. \nIn sum, Subpart H doubly forecloses FDA’s approval of mifepristone. At most, FDA might \nhave lawfully approved mifepristone under Subpart H for cases where a pregnant woman’s life or \nhealth is in danger. But even a limited approval of this sort would still not render pregnancy an \n“illness.” And surgical abortion — a statistically far safer procedure — would still be available to \nher. But in any case, that is not what FDA did. Instead, FDA manipulated and misconstrued the \ntext of Subpart H to greenlight elective chemical abortions on a wide scale. Therefore, Plaintiffs \nhave a substantial likelihood of prevailing on their claim that Defendants violated Subpart H. \n \n48 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 137   Filed 04/07/23    Page 49 of 67   PageID 4471\n2.  FDA’s Pre-2021 Actions were Arbitrary and Capricious \nUnder the FFDCA, a pharmaceutical company seeking to market a new drug must first \nobtain FDA approval via an NDA. See 21 U.S.C. § 355(a), (b). The NDA must include “adequate \ntests by all methods reasonably applicable to show whether or not such drug is safe for use under \nthe conditions prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the proposed labeling thereof.” 21 U.S.C. \n§ 355(d).  The  trials  must  “provide  an  adequate  basis  for  physician  labeling.” \n21 C.F.R. § 312.21(c). In those trials, “the drug is used the way it would be administered when \nmarketed.”46 The Secretary must deny the NDA if “he has insufficient information to determine \nwhether such drug is safe for use under such conditions.” 21 U.S.C. § 355(d)(4). \nHere, the U.S. trials FDA relied upon when approving mifepristone required that: (1) each \nwoman receive an ultrasound to confirm gestational age and exclude an ectopic pregnancy;47 (2) \nphysicians have experience in performing surgical abortions and admitting privileges at medical \nfacilities that provide emergency care; (3) all patients be within one hour of emergency facilities \nor the facilities of the principal investigator; and (4) women be monitored for four hours to check \nfor adverse events after taking misoprostol. ECF No. 7 at 23. However, FDA included none of \nthese requirements — which were explicitly stated in the clinical trial FDA relied on most — in \nthe 2000 Approval. Id. Likewise, FDA’s 2016 Changes omitted the requirements of the underlying \ntests: (1) gestational age confirmed by ultrasounds; (2) participants required to return for clinical \nassessment; and (3) surgical intervention if necessary.

ECF No. 1-28 at 19 n.47. Defendants do not explain how \nmany investigators chose to perform an ultrasound. The higher that number is, the more it supports Plaintiffs’ \nargument. But in any case, the U.S. trial was larger than the two French trials combined and is therefore the more \nreliable study. Id. at 9. \n \n49 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 137   Filed 04/07/23    Page 50 of 67   PageID 4472\nDefendants maintain “there is no legal basis for Plaintiffs’ contention that the approved \nconditions of use of a drug must duplicate the protocol requirements for the clinical trials \nsupporting its approval.” ECF No. 28  at 35. But FDA’s actions must not be arbitrary and \ncapricious.48 See 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A); United States v. An Article of Device . . . Diapulse, 768 \nF.2d 826, 832–33 (7th Cir. 1985) (concluding FDA’s denial was not arbitrary and capricious \nbecause the proposed labeling did not “specify conditions of use that are similar to those followed \nin the studies”). “The scope of review under the arbitrary and capricious standard is narrow and a \ncourt is not to substitute its judgment for that of the agency.” Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n of U.S., \nInc.  v.  State  Farm  Mut.  Auto.  Ins.  Co.,  463  U.S.  29,  43  (1983)  (internal  marks  omitted). \n“Nevertheless, the agency must examine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation \nfor its action including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.” Id. \n(internal marks omitted); see also Sw. Elec. Power Co. v. EPA, 920 F.3d 999, 1013 (5th Cir. 2019) \n(judicial review of agency action “is not toothless”). Courts must “consider whether the decision \nwas based on a consideration of the relevant factors and whether there has been a clear error of \njudgment.” Id. (internal marks omitted). An agency’s action is “arbitrary and capricious” if it \n“entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem, offered an explanation for its \ndecision that runs counter to the evidence before the agency, or is so implausible that it could not \nbe ascribed to a difference in view or the product of agency expertise.” Id. Defendants fail this test. \n \n \n48 Plaintiffs also frame what the Court characterized as the “study-match problem” as a statutory violation of the \nFFDCA. See ECF No. 7 at 22. The Court does not read 21 U.S.C. § 355(d) as necessarily requiring an exact \n“match” between trial conditions and the conditions on the approved labeling of a new drug. But Section 355(d) \ndoes mandate the Secretary “issue an order refusing to approve the application” if he finds the investigations do not \nshow the drug is safe for use under the suggested conditions in the proposed labeling. FDA made such a finding yet \ndid not deny the Application. See ECF No. 1-24 at 6 (“We have concluded that adequate information has not been \npresented to demonstrate that the drug, when marketed in accordance with the terms of distribution proposed, is safe \nand effective for use as recommended.”). Thus, even if Defendants could survive “arbitrary and capricious” analysis \nof the “study-match problem,” Defendants still violated Section 355(d) on their own terms.  \n50 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 137   Filed 04/07/23    Page 51 of 67   PageID 4473\na.  The 2000 Approval \nTo begin, FDA “entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem” by omitting \nany evaluation of the psychological effects of the drug or an evaluation of the long-term medical \nconsequences of the drug. State Farm, 463 U.S. at 43; ECF No. 84 at 12. Considering the intense \npsychological trauma and post-traumatic stress women often experience from chemical abortion, \nthis failure should not be overlooked or understated. Nor was the drug tested for under-18 girls \nundergoing reproductive development.49 But that is not all. Clinical trial protocols in the United \nStates for the 2000 Approval required a transvaginal ultrasound for each patient to accurately date \npregnancies and identify ectopic pregnancies. ECF No. 1-28 at 19. But FDA ultimately concluded \nthat “a provider can accurately make such a determination by performing a pelvic examination and \nobtaining a careful history.” Id. Thus, FDA determined it was inappropriate “to mandate how \nproviders clinically assess women for duration of pregnancy and for ectopic pregnancy.” ECF No. \n1-28 at 19. FDA believed “it is reasonable to expect that the women’s providers would not have \nprescribed  Mifeprex  if  a  pelvic  ultrasound  examination  had  clearly  identified  an  ectopic \npregnancy.” Id. at 20.  \nFDA thus assumes physicians will ascertain gestational age. But put another way, there is \nsimply no requirement that any procedure is done to rule out an ectopic pregnancy — which is a \nserious and life-threatening situation. This is arbitrary and capricious. The mere fact that other \nclinical methods can be used to date pregnancies does not support the view that it should be the \n \n49 In 1998, FDA issued the “Pediatric Rule,” which “mandated that drug manufacturers evaluate the safety and \neffectiveness of their products on pediatric patients, absent an applicable exception.” Ass’n of Am. Physicians & \nSurgeons, Inc. v. U.S. Food & Drug Admin., 391 F. Supp. 2d 171, 173–74 (D.D.C. 2005). Two years after approving \nmifepristone, FDA was enjoined from enforcing the Pediatric Rule because it lacked statutory authority in issuing \nthe rule. See Ass’n of Am. Physicians & Surgeons v. FDA, 226 F. Supp. 2d 204, 222 (D.D.C. 2002). In response, \nCongress enacted the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003 to codify the Pediatric Rule. See 21 U.S.C. § 355c. \nIn the 2000 Approval, FDA clarified that the Mifeprex NDA was covered by the Pediatric Rule. See ECF No. 1-26 \nat 4. However, FDA fully waived the rule’s requirements without explanation. ECF No. 1-28 at 30.  \n51 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 137   Filed 04/07/23    Page 52 of 67   PageID 4474\nprovider’s decision to decide which method — if any — is used to make this determination. FDA \nhas never denied that an ultrasound is the most accurate method to determine gestational age and \nidentify ectopic pregnancies. See ECF No. 1-14 at 62. And the fact that other clinical methods can \nbe used does not mean that all such methods are equal in their accuracy and reliability.50 FDA did \nrely on a study showing that clinicians rarely underestimate gestational age. ECF No. 1-28 at 19 \nn.49. But this study does nothing to support FDA’s view that a transvaginal ultrasound is not \nnecessary  to  diagnose  ectopic  pregnancies.  To this  point,  FDA  merely  argues  that  even \ntransvaginal ultrasounds do not guarantee an existing ectopic pregnancy will be identified. Id. at \n19. If that is the case, it does not follow that it should be left to the provider’s discretion to employ \nless reliable methods — or no methods at all.  \nCorrect diagnosis of gestational age and ectopic pregnancies is vital. The error in FDA’s \njudgment is borne out by myriad stories and studies brought to the Court’s attention. One woman \nalleged she did not receive an ultrasound or any other physical examination before receiving \nchemical abortion drugs from Planned Parenthood. ECF No. 1 at 22. “The abortionist misdated \nthe baby’s gestational age as six weeks, resulting in the at-home delivery of a ‘lifeless, fully-\nformed baby in the toilet,’ later determined to be around 30-36 weeks old.” Id.; see also Patel v. \nState, 60 N.E.3d 1041, 1043 (Ind. Ct. App. 2016) (woman who used chemical abortion drugs \n“delivered a live baby of approximately twenty-five to thirty weeks gestation who died shortly \nafter birth”). Another woman was given chemical abortion drugs during an ectopic pregnancy \nbecause her ultrasound “was not even that of a uterus but was of a bladder.”51 ECF No. 31 at 5. \n \n50 Studies reflect that women recurrently miscalculate their unborn child’s gestational age. See P. Taipale & V. \nHiilesmaa, Predicting delivery date by ultrasound and last menstrual period in early gestation, 97 OBSTETRICS \nGYN. 189 (2001); David A. Savitz et al., Comparison of pregnancy dating by last menstrual period, ultrasound \nscanning, and their combination, 187 AM. J. OBSTETRICS GYN. 1660 (2002).   \n \n51 This incident also demonstrates that even where ultrasounds are used, only a qualified provider can assure they are \ndone properly. \n52 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 137   Filed 04/07/23    Page 53 of 67   PageID 4475\nThe resulting  rupture  “led  to  massive  infection  and  a  collapse  of  her  vital  systems.”  Id. \nAmicus Human Coalition identified four of their clients who were unknowingly ectopic when they \narrived at their clinic “with abortion pills in hand.” ECF No. 96 at 20. And at least two women \ndied from chemical abortion drugs last year. See ECF No. 120 at 30 n.5. One of those women was \nan estimated twenty-one weeks pregnant. See id. Presumably, the fact that the woman obtained \nchemical abortion drugs more than two months past FDA’s gestational age cutoff suggests that no \nadequate procedures confirmed the gestational age in her case.  \nFDA has also reported at least ninety-seven cases where women with ectopic pregnancies \ntook mifepristone.52 But these data are likely incomplete because FDA now only requires reporting \non deaths. See ECF No. 1 at 4. And as noted above, hospitals often miscode complications from \nchemical abortions as miscarriages. Studies show that women are thirty percent more likely to die \nfrom a ruptured ectopic pregnancy while seeking abortions if the condition remains undiagnosed.53 \nA woman may interpret the warning signs of an ectopic pregnancy — cramping and severe \nbleeding — as side effects of mifepristone. In reality, the symptoms indicate her life is in danger.54 \nAnother study revealed that of 5,619 chemical abortion visits, 452 patients had a pregnancy of \n“unknown location” and 31 were treated for ectopic pregnancy — including 4 that were ruptured.55 \nYet another study examined 3,197 unique, U.S.-only adverse event reports dated September 2000 \n \n52 FDA, Mifepristone US.

After all, many tragedies could be \navoided  by  auditing  physician  qualifications  and  requiring  ultrasounds.  In 1996,  the  FDA \nAdvisory Committee expressed to the Population Council “serious reservations” on how the drugs \nwere described “in terms of assuring safe and adequate credentialing of providers.” ECF No. 1-14 \nat 51. Population Council initially committed to conducting post-approval studies in 1996, and \nFDA reiterated these requirements mere months before the September 2000 approval. See ECF \nNo. 1-24 at 6 (“We remind you of your commitments dated September 16, 1996, to perform the . . . \nPhase 4 studies.”). Those protocols would have required, inter alia, that the Population Council: \n(1) assess the long-term effects of multiple uses of mifepristone; (2) ascertain the frequency with \nwhich women follow the regimen and outcomes of those that do not; (3) study the safety and \nefficacy of chemical abortion in girls under the age of eighteen; and (4) ascertain the regimen’s \neffects on children born after treatment failure.58 ECF No. 1-28 at 32.  \n \n \n56 Aultman et al., supra note 44. \n \n57 Id.  \n \n58 See 153 Cong. Rec. S5765 (daily ed. May 9, 2007) (statement of Sen. Coburn) (“I recently learned of a woman \nwho was given RU-486 after she had a seizure. Her physicians assumed that the seizure was life-threatening to the \nbaby she was carrying and gave her RU-486 for a therapeutic abortion. RU–486 was not effective in her case and the \nwoman carried the baby to term. When the baby was born at a low birth weight, it also suffered from failure to \nthrive. That baby has had three subsequent brain surgeries due to hydrocephalus. The baby also suffers from \n[idiopathic lymphocytic colitis] — an inflammatory disease of the colon, which is extremely rare in children. It is \nclear that RU-486 not only is unsafe in women, but it is also not completely effective. And when it is not effective, \nthe results are devastating.”). \n54 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 137   Filed 04/07/23    Page 55 of 67   PageID 4477\nSimilarly, on February 18, 2000 — months before chemical abortion approval — FDA \ninformed  the  Population  Council  that  “adequate  information  ha[d]  not  been  presented  to \ndemonstrate that the drug, when marketed in accordance with the terms of distribution proposed, \nis safe and effective for use as recommended.” ECF No. 1-24 at 6 (emphasis added). FDA then \nstated the “restrictions on distribution will need to be amended.” Id. Accordingly, FDA informed \nthe Population Council that it would proceed under Subpart H — the only provision that could \nimplement the requisite restrictions on distribution. Id. But as explained above, that was the \nimproper regulation for the approval of chemical abortion. Regardless, the restrictions were \ninsufficient to ensure safe use. \nOn June 1, 2000, FDA privately delivered to the Population Council a set of proposed \nrestrictions to rectify the safety issues. Said proposal required physicians who were: (1) “trained \nand authorized by law” to perform surgical abortions; (2) trained in administering mifepristone \nand treating adverse events; and (3) allowed “continuing access (e.g., admitting privileges) to a \nmedical facility equipped for instrumental pregnancy termination, resuscitation procedures, and \nblood transfusion at the facility or [one hour’s] drive from the treatment facility.” See ECF No. 1-\n14 at 53–54. When FDA’s proposal was leaked to the press, a political and editorial backlash \nensued.59 In response, the Population Council rejected the proposal and repudiated the restrictions \nthe sponsor itself proposed in 1996 — what FDA deemed a “very significant change” in the \nsponsor’s position. Id. at 50. Because “[t]he whole idea of mifepristone was to increase access,” \nabortion advocates argued that restrictions on mifepristone “would effectively eliminate” the \ndrug’s “main advantage” and would “kill[] the drug.”60 \n \n59 Sheryl Gay Stolberg, FDA Adds Hurdles in Approval of Abortion Pill, THE NEW YORK TIMES (June 8, 2000), \nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2000/06/08/us/fda-adds-hurdles-in-approval-of-abortion-pill.html.  \n \n60 Id.  \n55 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 137   Filed 04/07/23    Page 56 of 67   PageID 4478\nIn September 2000, FDA abandoned its safety proposals and acquiesced to the objections \nof the Population Council and Danco. Despite its “serious reservations” about mifepristone’s \nsafety, FDA approved a regimen that relied on a self-certification that a prescribing physician has \nthe ability to diagnose ectopic pregnancies. Id. at 51, 62; see also ECF No. 1-28 at 21 (“[W]e \nconcluded that there was no need for special certification programs or additional restrictions.”). \nFDA later released the applicant entirely from its Phase 4 duties — twelve years after the 1996 \ncommitment. ECF Nos. 1-24 at 6, 1-28 at 32; see also 21 C.F.R. § 314.510 (“Approval under this \nsection will be subject to the requirement that the applicant study the drug further, to verify and \ndescribe its clinical benefit, where there is uncertainty . . . of the observed clinical benefit to \nultimate outcome. Postmarketing studies would usually be studies already underway.”) (emphasis \nadded). \nFDA  must  refuse  to  approve  a  drug  if  the  agency  determines  there  is  “insufficient \ninformation to determine whether such drug is safe for use” or a “lack of substantial evidence that \nthe drug will have the effect it purports or is represented to have” under the conditions of use in \nthe proposed label. 21 U.S.C. § 355(d)(4)–(5); see also 21 C.F.R. § 314.125(b). FDA is therefore \nrequired to deny an NDA if it makes the exact findings FDA made in its 2000 review. “[A]n \nagency’s decision to change course may be arbitrary and capricious if the agency ignores or \ncountermands its earlier factual findings without reasoned explanation for doing so.” F.C.C. v. Fox \nTelevision Stations, Inc., 556 U.S. 502, 537 (2009). The agency must ordinarily “display awareness \nthat it is changing position,” and “must show that there are good reasons for the new policy.” Id. \nat 515. And “if the agency’s decision was in any material way influenced by political concerns it \nshould not be upheld.” Earth Island Inst. v. Hogarth, 494 F.3d 757, 768 (9th Cir. 2007). FDA’s \nonly acknowledgments of its prior proposals were that “FDA and the applicant were not always in \n56 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 137   Filed 04/07/23    Page 57 of 67   PageID 4479\nfull agreement about the distribution restrictions” and that fulfilling the Phase 4 commitments \n“would not be feasible.” ECF No. 1-28 at 18, 32–33. \nThe  Court  does  not  second-guess  FDA’s  decision-making  lightly.  But  here,  FDA \nacquiesced on its legitimate safety concerns — in violation of its statutory duty — based on plainly \nunsound reasoning and studies that did not support its conclusions. There is also evidence \nindicating FDA faced significant political pressure to forego its proposed safety precautions to \nbetter advance the political objective of increased “access” to chemical abortion — which was the \n“whole idea of mifepristone.”61 As President Clinton’s Secretary for Health & Human Services \n(“HHS”) explained to the White House, it was FDA that arranged the meeting between the French \npharmaceutical firm — who owned the mifepristone patent rights — and the eventual drug sponsor \nPopulation Council. The purpose of the FDA-organized meeting was “to facilitate an agreement \nbetween those parties to work together to test [mifepristone] and file a new drug application.” ECF \nNo. 95 at 14. HHS also “initiated” another meeting “to assess how the United States Government” \n— i.e., the Clinton Administration — “might facilitate successful completion of the negotiations” \nbetween the French firm and the American drug sponsor to secure patent rights and eventual FDA \napproval. Id. at 16. In fact, for their “negotiations [to be] successfully concluded,” the HHS \nSecretary believed American pressure on the French firm was necessary. 62 Id. \nWhether FDA abandoned its proposed restrictions because of political pressure or not, one \nthing is clear: the lack of restrictions resulted in many deaths and many more severe or life-\n \n61 Stolberg, supra note 59. \n \n62 See also Lars Noah, A Miscarriage in the Drug Approval Process?: Mifepristone Embroils the FDA in Abortion \nPolitics, 36 WAKE FOREST L. REV. 571, 576 (2001) (“The Clinton administration went to great lengths to bring \nmifepristone into the United States. From pressuring the hesitant manufacturer to apply for approval, and utilizing a \nspecialized review procedure normally reserved for life-saving drugs, to imposing unusual restrictions on \ndistribution, and promising to keep the identity of the manufacturer a secret, the FDA’s approval process deviated \nfrom the norm in several respects.”). \n \n57 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 137   Filed 04/07/23    Page 58 of 67   PageID 4480\nthreatening adverse reactions. Due to FDA’s lax reporting requirements, the exact number is not \nascertainable. But it is likely far higher than its data indicate for reasons previously mentioned. \nWhatever the numbers are, they likely would be considerably lower had FDA not acquiesced to \nthe  pressure  to  increase  access  to  chemical  abortion  at  the  expense  of  women’s  safety. \nFDA’s failure to insist on the inclusion of its proposed safety restrictions was not “the product of \nreasoned decisionmaking.” State Farm, 463 U.S. at 52. To hold otherwise would be “tantamount \nto abdicating the judiciary’s responsibility under the [APA] to set aside agency actions that are \n‘arbitrary,  capricious,  an  abuse  of  discretion,  or  otherwise  not  in  accordance  with  law.’” \nA.L. Pharma, Inc. v. Shalala, 62 F.3d 1484, 1491 (D.C. Cir. 1995) (quoting 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A)). \nFinally, the 2000 Approval was also arbitrary and capricious because it violated Subpart H.63  \nb.  The 2016 Changes \nFDA made numerous substantial changes to the chemical abortion regimen in 2016. These \nchanges include but are not limited to: (1) eliminating the requirement for prescribers to report all \nnonfatal serious adverse events; (2) extending the maximum gestational age from 49 days to 70 \ndays; (3) eliminating the requirement that administration of misoprostol occurs in-clinic; (4) \nremoving  the  requirement  for  an  in-person  follow-up  exam;  and  (5)  allowing  “healthcare \nproviders” other than physicians to dispense chemical abortion drugs. ECF No. 1 at 53–54. \nPlaintiffs allege the 2016 Changes were also arbitrary and capricious “because none of the studies \non which FDA relied were designed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of chemical abortion \n \n63 As one scholar noted, “the agency took this route so that it could better justify imposing otherwise unauthorized \nrestrictions on the use and distribution of the drug.” See Noah, supra note 62, at 582. And “while agency action may \ngenerally be ‘entitled to a presumption of regularity,’ here FDA itself acknowledges that its action has not been \nregular: it failed to respond to the Citizen Petition for years.” Bayer, 942 F. Supp. 2d at 25 (internal marks omitted). \nAt the hearing, Defendants’ leading argument for Subpart H was that “none of it really matters” because of the \nFDAAA. See ECF No. 136 at 100. “This is not the argument of an agency that is confident in the legality of its \nactions.” ECF No. 100 at 15.  \n \n58 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 137   Filed 04/07/23    Page 59 of 67   PageID 4481\ndrugs for use under the conditions prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the proposed \nlabeling.” ECF No. 7 at 24. \nFor similar reasons as the 2000 Approval, the Court agrees. Unlike the crucial studies FDA \nrelied upon to extend the maximum gestational age, change the dosing regimen, and authorize a \nrepeat dose of misoprostol, the labeling approved by FDA in 2016 did not require: (1) an \nultrasound; (2) an in-person follow-up exam; or (3) the ability of abortionists to personally perform \na surgical abortion if necessary. Id. Simply put, FDA built on its already-suspect 2000 Approval \nby removing even more restrictions related to chemical abortion drugs that were present during the \nfinal phase of the investigation. And it did so by relying on studies that included the very conditions \nFDA refused to adopt.64 None of the studies compared the safety of the changes against the then-\ncurrent  regimen,  nor  under  the  labeled  conditions  of  use.  Moreover, FDA  shirked  any \nresponsibility for the consequences of its actions by eliminating any requirement that non-fatal \nadverse events be reported. Thus, FDA took its chemical abortion regimen — which had already \nculminated in thousands of adverse events suffered by women and girls — and removed what little \nrestrictions protected these women and girls, systematically ensuring that almost all new adverse \nevents would go unreported or underreported.  \nDefendants aver that “Plaintiffs point to no statutory provision requiring the conditions of \nuse in a drug’s approved labeling to duplicate the protocol requirements used in the studies \nsupporting its approval.” ECF No. 28 at 32. “The [FFDCA] thus requires FDA to apply its \nscientific expertise in determining whether a drug has been shown to be safe and effective under \nparticular conditions of use, and the application of that expertise is owed substantial deference.” \nId. But FDA does not have unfettered discretion to approve dangerous drugs under substantially \n \n64 See ECF No. 1-35. \n59 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 137   Filed 04/07/23    Page 60 of 67   PageID 4482\ndifferent conditions than the tests, trials, and studies cited. To be clear, the Court does not hold \nthat any difference between approval conditions and testing conditions — no matter how well-\njustified — means the approval fails as a matter of law. But the agency “must cogently explain \nwhy it has exercised its discretion in a given manner,” and that explanation must be “sufficient to \nenable  [the  Court]  to  conclude  that  the  [agency’s  action]  was  the  product  of  reasoned \ndecisionmaking.” A.L. Pharma, 62 F.3d at 1491 (quoting State Farm, 463 U.S. at 52). Defendants \nhave not done so here. FDA’s 2016 Actions were not the product of reasoned decision-making. \nc.  The 2019 Generic Approval  \nThe FFDCA allows a generic drug manufacturer to submit an ANDA for premarket review \nand approval. 21 U.S.C. § 355(j); 21 C.F.R. § 314.94. The generic sponsor must show that: (1) the \nconditions of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the labeling have been previously \napproved; and (2) the drug product is chemically the same as the already approved drug — \nallowing it to rely on FDA’s previous finding of safety and effectiveness for the approved drug. \nId.  On  April  11,  2019,  FDA  approved  GenBioPro,  Inc.’s  ANDA  for  a  generic  version  of \nmifepristone. ECF No. 7 at 10. In doing so, FDA relied on Mifeprex’s safety data. Id.  \nPlaintiffs argue the 2019 Approval was unlawful because FDA relied on the unlawful 2000 \nApproval and its unlawful 2016 Changes when approving generic mifepristone. ECF No. 7 at 27. \nIf FDA withdraws the listed drug on which the ANDA-approved generic drug is based, the agency \nis generally required to withdraw the generic drug as well. 21 U.S.C. § 355(j)(6); 21 C.F.R. § \n314.151. Because the Court agrees that Plaintiffs have a substantial likelihood of success in their \nchallenges to the 2000 and 2016 Actions, the Court is inclined to agree with Plaintiffs on this claim \nas well. \n \n60 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 137   Filed 04/07/23    Page 61 of 67   PageID 4483\nE.  There Is a Substantial Threat of Irreparable Harm  \n \nTo satisfy the second element of the preliminary injunction standard, Plaintiffs “must \ndemonstrate that if the district court denied the grant of a preliminary injunction, irreparable harm \nwould result.” Janvey, 647 F.3d at 600 (internal marks omitted). “In general, a harm is irreparable \nwhere there is no adequate remedy at law, such as monetary damages.” Id.

Agency, 829 F.3d 405, 433–34 (5th Cir. 2016) \n(internal marks omitted). Where “the likelihood of success on the merits is very high, a much \nsmaller quantum of injury will sustain an application for preliminary injunction.” Mova Pharm. \nCorp. v. Shalala, 955 F.

Comm’n, 772 F.2d 972, 974 (D.C.Cir. 1985) (per curiam)). \nPlaintiffs’ Motion satisfies this standard. \nFor reasons already stated, Plaintiffs are likely to suffer irreparable harm if the Motion is \nnot granted. At least two women died from chemical abortion drugs just last year. See ECF No. \n120 at 30 n.5;65 Deerfield Med. Ctr. v.

ECF No. 28 at 41. This argument ignores that many restrictions and safeguards — which \nno longer exist — were in place for most of that time. Defendants also argue “Plaintiffs’ extreme \ndelay” in filing suit shows they face no irreparable harm. Id. at 42. But the time between the \nallegedly unlawful actions and the filing of a suit “is not determinative” of whether relief should \nbe granted. Boire v. Pilot Freight Carriers, Inc., 515 F.2d 1185, 1193 (5th Cir. 1975). Here, eleven \nmonths does not constitute an “extreme” delay. See, e.g., Optimus Steel, LLC v. U.S. Army Corps \nof Eng’rs, 492 F. Supp. 3d 701, 720 (E.D. Tex. 2020) (eleven-month delay did not militate against \nequitable relief because “the Court can presume that Plaintiff needed ample time to evaluate its \nclaims”).66 “[T]emporary injunctive relief may still be of great value to protect against ongoing \nharms, even if the initial harm is in the distant past.” N.L.R.B. v. Hartman & Tyner, Inc., 714 F.3d \n1244, 1252 (11th Cir. 2013).  \nThe Court also disagrees that Plaintiffs’ theories of injury “are too speculative to even show \nstanding.” ECF No. 28 at 42. Plaintiffs have credibly alleged past and future harm resulting from \nthe removal of restrictions for chemical abortion drugs. “Although a court’s analysis of likelihood \nof success in the context of an injunctive relief request is governed by the deferential APA’s \narbitrary and capricious standard, a court does not always owe deference to federal agencies’ \npositions concerning irreparable harm, balance of hardships, or public interest.” San Luis & Delta-\n \n66 To clarify, the eleven months referenced here is the approximate time between FDA’s “final agency action” in the \nDecember 2021 Denial of the 2019 Petition and the commencement of this case.  \n62 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 137   Filed 04/07/23    Page 63 of 67   PageID 4485\nMendota Water Auth. v.

And “there is a strong public interest in meticulous compliance \nwith the law by public officials.” Fund for Animals, Inc. v. Espy, 814 F. Supp. 142, 152 (D.D.C. \n1993); see also State v.

But “[u]sing abortion to promote eugenic goals is morally and prudentially \ndebatable.” Planned Parenthood of Ind. & Ky., Inc. v. Comm’r of Ind. State Dep’t of Health, 917 \nF.3d 532, 536 (7th Cir. 2018) (Easterbrook, J., dissenting); see also Box v. Planned Parenthood of \nInd. & Ky., Inc., 139 S. Ct. 1780, 1790 (2019) (Thomas, J., concurring) (“[A]bortion has proved \nto be a disturbingly effective tool for implementing the discriminatory preferences that undergird \neugenics.”). Though eugenics were once fashionable in the Commanding Heights and High Court, \nthey hold less purchase after the conflict, carnage, and casualties of the last century revealed the \nbloody consequences of Social Darwinism practiced by would-be Übermenschen. Cf. Buck v. Bell, \n274 U.S. 200, 207 (1927) (“It is better for all the world, if instead of waiting to execute degenerate \noffspring for crime, or to let them starve for their imbecility, society can prevent those who are \nmanifestly unfit from continuing their kind. The principle that sustains compulsory vaccination is \nbroad enough to cover cutting the Fallopian tubes.”). \nDefendants are correct that one purpose of injunctive relief is to preserve the status quo. \nSee, e.g., City of Dallas v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., 847 F.3d 279, 285 (5th Cir. 2017). But the “status \nquo” to be restored is “the last peaceable uncontested status existing between the parties before the \n64 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 137   Filed 04/07/23    Page 65 of 67   PageID 4487\ndispute developed.” Texas v. Biden, No. 2:21-CV-067-Z, 2022 WL 17718634, at *9 (N.D. Tex. \nDec. 15, 2022) (internal marks omitted); see also Texas v. United States, 40 F.4th 205, 220 (5th \nCir. 2022) (the relevant status quo is the one “absent the unlawful agency action”); Wages & White \nLion,  16  F.4th  at  1144  (“In  other  words,  ‘the  relief  sought  here  would  simply  suspend \nadministrative alteration of the status quo.’”) (quoting Nken, 556 U.S. at 430 n.1); Callaway, 489 \nF.2d at 576 (“If the currently existing status quo itself is causing one of the parties irreparable \ninjury, it is necessary to alter the situation so as to prevent the injury.”). “[P]arties could otherwise \nhave no real opportunity to seek judicial review except at their peril.” Mila Sohoni, The Power to \nVacate a Rule, 88 GEO. WASH. L. REV. 1121, 1157–58 (2020). Chemical abortion is only the status \nquo insofar as Defendants’ unlawful actions and their delay in responding to Plaintiffs’ petitions \nhave made it so. The fact that injunctive relief could upset this “status quo” is therefore an \ninsufficient basis to deny injunctive relief. \nG. A Stay Under Section 705 of the APA Is More Appropriate Than Ordering \nWithdrawal or Suspension of FDA’s Approval \n \nThe Motion asks for injunctive relief but goes as far as requesting the Court to order \nDefendants to “withdraw or suspend the approvals of chemical abortion drugs, and remove them \nfrom the list of approved drugs.” ECF No. 7 at 7. Singular equitable relief is “commonplace” in \nAPA cases and is often “necessary to provide the plaintiffs” with “complete redress.” E. Bay \nSanctuary Covenant v. Biden, 993 F.3d 640, 681 (9th Cir. 2021) (internal marks omitted). \nAlthough the Court finds Plaintiffs have a substantial likelihood of prevailing on the merits, the \nCourt instead exercises its authority under the APA to order less drastic relief. Section 705 of the \nAPA provides: \n \n65 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 137   Filed 04/07/23    Page 66 of 67   PageID 4488\nWhen an agency finds that justice so requires, it may postpone the effective date of \naction taken by it, pending judicial review. On such conditions as may be required \nand to the extent necessary to prevent irreparable injury, the reviewing court, \nincluding the court to which a case may be taken on appeal from or on application \nfor certiorari or other writ to a reviewing court, may issue all necessary and \nappropriate process to postpone the effective date of an agency action or to \npreserve status or rights pending conclusion of the review proceedings. \n \n5 U.S.C. § 705 (emphasis added). \n \nThe Fifth Circuit has acknowledged “meaningful differences between an injunction, which \nis a ‘drastic and extraordinary remedy,’ and vacatur, which is ‘a less drastic remedy.’” Texas v. \nBiden, 2022 WL 17718634 at *7 (quoting Texas v. United States, 40 F.4th at 219). Whereas an \ninjunction “tells someone what to do or not to do,” a vacatur only reinstates “the status quo absent \nthe unlawful agency action and neither compels nor restrains further agency decision-making.” Id. \n(internal marks omitted). A Section 705 stay can “be seen as an interim or lesser form of vacatur \nunder Section 706.” Id. “Just as a preliminary injunction is often a precursor to a permanent \ninjunction, a stay under Section 705 can be viewed as a precursor to vacatur under Section 706.” \nId.; see also Nken, 556 U.S. at 428–29 (a stay “temporarily suspend[s] the source of authority to \nact — the order or judgment in question — not by directing an actor’s conduct”). “Motions to stay \nagency action pursuant to [Section 705] are reviewed under the same standards used to evaluate \nrequests for interim injunctive relief.” Id. at *10 (citing Affinity Healthcare Servs., Inc. v. Sebelius, \n720 F. Supp. 2d 12, 15 n.4 (D.D.C. 2010)); see also Nken, 556 U.S. at 434; Texas v. U.S. Env’t \nProt. Agency, 829 F.3d at 435. Because the Court finds injunctive relief is generally appropriate, \nSection 705 plainly authorizes the lesser remedy of issuing “all necessary and appropriate process” \nto postpone the effective date of the challenged actions. “Courts — including the Supreme Court \n— routinely stay already-effective agency action under Section 705.” Id. at *8 (emphasis added) \n(collecting cases).  \n66 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 137   Filed 04/07/23    Page 67 of 67   PageID 4489\nAccordingly, the Court hereby STAYS the effective date of FDA’s September 28, 2000, \nApproval of mifepristone and all subsequent challenged actions related to that approval — i.e., the \n2016 Changes, the 2019 Generic Approval, and the 2021 Actions. This Court acknowledges that \nits decision in Texas v. Biden has been appealed to the Fifth Circuit. See 2:21-CV-067-Z, ECF No. \n184 (Feb. 13, 2023). If the Fifth Circuit reverses this Court’s Section 705 analysis, the Court \nclarifies that it alternatively would have ordered Defendants to suspend the chemical abortion \napproval and all subsequent challenged actions related to that approval until the Court can render \na decision on the merits.  \nCONCLUSION \n \nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court GRANTS the Motion IN PART. FDA’s approval of \nmifepristone is hereby STAYED. The Court STAYS the applicability of this opinion and order \nfor seven (7) days to allow the federal government time to seek emergency relief from the United \nStates Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. \n  SO ORDERED. \nApril 7, 2023 \n________________________________  \n            MATTHEW J.

Detroit Timber & Lumber  Co., 200 U. S. 321, 337. \nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES \nSyllabus  \nFOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION  ET  AL. v. \nALLIANCE  FOR HIPPOCRATIC MEDICINE  ET  AL. \nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR \nTHE FIFTH CIRCUIT  \nNo. 23–235.  Argued March 26, 2024—Decided June 13, 2024* \nIn 2000, the Food and Drug Administration approved a new drug \napplication for mifepristone tablets marketed under the brand name \nMifeprex for use in terminating pregnancies up to seven weeks.  To \nhelp ensure that Mifeprex  would be  used safely and effectively, FDA \nplaced additional restrictions on the drug’s use and distribution, for \nexample requiring doctors to prescribe or to supervise prescription of \nMifeprex, and requiring patients to have three in-person visits with \nthe doctor to receive the drug.  In 2016, FDA relaxed some of these  \nrestrictions: deeming Mifeprex safe to terminate pregnancies up to 10 \nweeks; allowing healthcare providers, such as nurse practitioners, to \nprescribe Mifeprex; and approving a dosing regimen that required just \none in-person  visit to receive the drug.  In 2019, FDA approved an  \napplication for generic mifepristone.  In 2021, FDA announced that it  \nwould no longer enforce the initial in-person visit requirement.  Four \npro-life medical associations and several individual doctors moved for \na preliminary injunction that would require FDA either to rescind \napproval of mifepristone or to rescind FDA’s 2016 and 2021 regulatory \nactions.  Danco Laboratories, which sponsors Mifeprex, intervened to \ndefend FDA’s actions.  \n    The District Court agreed with the plaintiffs and in effect enjoined \nFDA’s approval of mifepristone, thereby ordering mifepristone off the \nmarket.  FDA and Danco appealed and moved to stay the District \nCourt’s order pending appeal.  As relevant here, this Court ultimately  \n—————— \n*Together with No. 23–236, Danco Laboratories, L.L.C. v.  Alliance for \nHippocratic Medicine, also on certiorari to the United States Court of  \nAppeals for the Fifth Circuit. \n \n\n2  FDA v. ALLIANCE FOR HIPPOCRATIC MEDICINE  \n    \nSyllabus  \nstayed  the  District  Court’s  order  pending  the  disposition  of  \nproceedings in the Fifth Circuit and this Court.  On the merits, the \nFifth Circuit held that plaintiffs had standing.  It concluded that  \nplaintiffs were unlikely to succeed on their  challenge to FDA’s 2000  \nand 2019 drug approvals, but were likely to succeed in showing that \nFDA’s 2016 and 2021 actions were  unlawful.  This Court granted \ncertiorari with respect to the 2016 and 2021 FDA actions. \nHeld: Plaintiffs lack Article III standing to challenge FDA’s actions \nregarding the regulation of mifepristone.  Pp. 5–25. \n  (a) Article III standing is a “bedrock constitutional requirement that \nthis Court has applied to all manner of important disputes.”  United \nStates v.  Texas, 599 U. S. 670, 675.  Standing is “built on a single basic \nidea—the idea of separation of powers.”   Ibid. Article III confines the  \njurisdiction of federal courts to “Cases” and “Controversies.”  Federal  \ncourts do not operate as an open forum for citizens “to press general \ncomplaints  about  the  way  in  which  government   goes  about  its \nbusiness.”  Allen v. Wright, 468 U. S. 737, 760.  To obtain a judicial \ndetermination of what the governing law is, a plaintiff must have a \n“personal stake” in the dispute.  TransUnion LLC v. Ramirez, 594  \nU. S. 413, 423.  \n  To establish standing, a plaintiff must demonstrate (i) that she has \nsuffered or likely will suffer an injury in fact, (ii)  that the injury likely \nwas caused or will be caused by the defendant, and (iii)  that the injury \nlikely  would  be  redressed  by  the  requested  judicial   relief.  See  \nSummers v.  Earth Island Institute, 555 U. S. 488, 493.  The two key  \nquestions in most standing disputes are injury in fact and causation.   \nBy requiring the plaintiff to show an injury in fact, Article III standing  \nscreens out plaintiffs who might have only a general legal, moral, \nideological, or policy objection to a particular government action.   \nCausation requires the plaintiff to establish that the plaintiff  ’s injury \nlikely was caused or likely will be caused by the defendant’s conduct.  \nCausation is “ordinarily substantially more difficult to establish” when \n(as here) a plaintiff challenges the government’s “unlawful regulation \n(or lack of regulation) of someone else.” Lujan v. Defenders  of  Wildlife, \n504 U. S. 555, 560–561.  That is because unregulated parties often may \nhave more difficulty linking their asserted injuries to the government’s \nregulation (or  lack of regulation) of someone else.  Pp. 5–12. \n  (b) Plaintiffs are pro-life, oppose elective abortion, and have sincere \nlegal, moral, ideological, and policy objections to mifepristone being \nprescribed and used by others.  Because plaintiffs  do not prescribe or \nuse  mifepristone,  plaintiffs  are  unregulated  parties  who  seek  to  \nchallenge  FDA’s  regulation  of   others.  Plaintiffs   advance  several \ncomplicated  causation  theories  to  connect  FDA’s  actions  to  the \nplaintiffs’ alleged injuries in fact.  None of these theories suffices to  \n \n\n  Cite as:  602 U. S. ____ (2024)  3 \n \nSyllabus  \nestablish Article III standing.  Pp. 13–24.\n(1) Plaintiffs  first  contend   that  FDA’s  relaxed  regulation  of  \nmifepristone  may  cause  downstream  conscience  injuries  to  the \nindividual doctors.  Even assuming that FDA’s 2016 and 2021 changes \nto mifepristone’s conditions of use cause more pregnant women to \nrequire emergency abortions and that some women would likely seek \ntreatment from these plaintiff doctors, the plaintiff doctors have not \nshown that they could be forced to participate in an abortion or provide \nabortion-related medical treatment over their conscience objections.  \nFederal  conscience  laws  definitively  protect  doctors  from  being \nrequired to perform abortions or  to provide other treatment that  \nviolates  their  consciences.  Federal  law  protects  doctors  from \nrepercussions when they have “refused” to participate in an abortion.  \n§300a–7(c)(1).  The plaintiffs have  not identified any instances where \na  doctor  was  required,  notwithstanding  conscience  objections,  to \nperform an abortion or to provide other abortion-related treatment \nthat  violated  the  doctor’s  conscience  since  mifepristone’s  2000 \napproval.  Further, the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act \n(or EMTALA) neither overrides federal conscience laws nor requires  \nindividual  emergency  room  doctors  to  participate  in  emergency \nabortions.  Thus, there is a break in any  chain of causation between \nFDA’s relaxed regulation of mifepristone and any asserted conscience \ninjuries to the doctors.  Pp. 14–17. \n    (2) Plaintiffs   next  assert  they  have  standing  because  FDA’s \nrelaxed regulation of mifepristone may cause downstream economic \ninjuries to the doctors.  The doctors cite various monetary and related \ninjuries that they will allegedly suffer as a result of FDA’s actions—in \nparticular, diverting resources and time from other patients to treat \npatients with mifepristone complications; increasing risk of liability \nsuits  from  treating  those  patients;  and  potentially  increasing \ninsurance costs.  But the causal link between FDA’s  regulatory actions \nin 2016 and 2021 and those alleged injuries is too speculative, lacks \nsupport in the record, and is otherwise too attenuated to establish  \nstanding.  Moreover, the law has never permitted doctors to challenge \nthe government’s loosening of general public safety requirements \nsimply because more individuals might then show up at emergency \nrooms or in doctors’ offices with follow-on injuries.  Citizens and  \ndoctors who object to what the law allows others to do may always take \ntheir concerns to the Executive and Legislative Branches and seek \ngreater regulatory or legislative restrictions.  Pp. 18–21. \n    (3) Plaintiff medical associations assert their own organizational  \nstanding.  Under the Court’s precedents, organizations may have  \nstanding “to sue on their own behalf for injuries they have sustained,” \nHavens  Realty  Corp.  v.   Coleman,  455  U. S.  363,  379,  n.  19,  but  \n \n\n4  FDA v. ALLIANCE FOR HIPPOCRATIC MEDICINE  \n    \nSyllabus  \norganizations must satisfy the usual standards for injury in fact,  \ncausation, and redressability that apply to individuals, id., at 378–379.  \nAccording to the medical associations, FDA has “impaired” their \n“ability to provide services and achieve their organizational missions.”  \nBrief  for  Respondents  43.    That  argument  does  not  work  to \ndemonstrate standing.  Like an individual, an organization may not  \nestablish standing simply based on the “intensity of the litigant’s \ninterest” or because of strong opposition to the government’s conduct, \nValley Forge Christian College v.  Americans United for Separation of \nChurch and State, Inc., 454 U. S. 464, 486.  The plaintiff associations  \ntherefore cannot establish standing simply because they object to \nFDA’s actions.  The medical associations claim to have standing based  \non their incurring  costs to oppose FDA’s actions.  They say that FDA \nhas  “caused”  the  associations  to  conduct  their  own  studies  on \nmifepristone so that the associations can better inform their members \nand the public about mifepristone’s risks.  Brief for Respondents 43.   \nThey contend that FDA has “forced” the associations to “expend \nconsiderable time, energy, and resources” drafting citizen petitions to \nFDA, as well as engaging in public advocacy and public education, all \nto the detriment of other spending priorities.  Id., at 44.  But an \norganization that has not  suffered a concrete injury caused by a \ndefendant’s action cannot spend its way into standing simply by \nexpending money to gather information  and advocate against the  \ndefendant’s  action.    Contrary  to  what  the  medical  associations  \ncontend, the Court’s decision in Havens Realty Corp. v. Coleman  does \nnot stand for the expansive theory that standing exists when an  \norganization diverts its resources in response to a defendant’s actions.   \nHavens was an  unusual case, and this Court has been careful not to \nextend the Havens holding beyond its context.  So too here.  \n  Finally, it was suggested that plaintiffs must have standing because \notherwise it may be that no one would have standing to challenge  \nFDA’s 2016 and 2021 actions.  That suggestion fails because the Court \nhas long  rejected that kind of argument as a basis for standing.  The \n“assumption” that if these plaintiffs lack “standing to sue, no one  \nwould have standing, is not a reason to find standing.”  Schlesinger v.  \nReservists Comm. to Stop the War, 418 U. S. 208, 227.  Rather, some  \nissues may be left to the political and democratic processes.

Those changes made it easier for doctors to \nprescribe  and  pregnant  women  to  obtain  mifepristone.  \nSeveral pro-life doctors and associations sued FDA, arguing \nthat FDA’s actions violated the Administrative Procedure \nAct. But the plaintiffs do not prescribe or use mifepristone.  \nAnd FDA is not requiring them to do or refrain from doing \nanything.  Rather,  the  plaintiffs  want  FDA  to  make  \nmifepristone more difficult for other doctors to prescribe \nand for pregnant women to obtain.  Under Article III of the \nConstitution,  a  plaintiff ’s  desire  to  make  a  drug  less\n \navailable for others  does not establish standing to sue. Nor \ndo the plaintiffs’ other standing theories suffice.  Therefore, \nthe plaintiffs lack standing to challenge FDA’s actions. \n \n\n2  FDA v. ALLIANCE FOR HIPPOCRATIC MEDICINE  \n    \nOpinion of the Court \nI \nA \n  Under  federal  law,  the  U. S.  Food  and  Drug \nAdministration, an agency within the Executive Branch, \nensures that drugs on the market are safe and effective.  \nFor FDA to approve a new drug, the drug sponsor (usually \nthe  drug’s  manufacturer  or  potential  marketer)  must \nsubmit an application demonstrating that the drug is safe \nand effective when used as directed.  21 U. S.  C. §355(d).  \nThe sponsor’s application must generally include proposed \nlabeling that specifies the drug’s dosage, how to take the \ndrug, and the specific conditions that the drug may treat.  \n21 CFR §§201.5, 314.50 (2022). \n  If FDA determines that additional safety requirements\nare necessary, FDA may impose extra requirements on \nprescription and use of the drug.  21 U. S. C. §355–1(f )(3).  \n \nFor example, FDA may require that prescribers undergo \nspecialized training; mandate that the drug be dispensed \nonly in certain settings like hospitals; or direct that doctors \nmonitor patients taking the drug.  Ibid.  \n  In  2000,  FDA  approved  a  new  drug  application  for\nmifepristone  tablets  marketed  under  the  brand  name \nMifeprex.  FDA approved Mifeprex for use to terminate  \npregnancies, but only up to seven weeks of pregnancy.  To \nhelp  ensure  that  Mifeprex  would  be  used  safely  and\neffectively, FDA placed further restrictions on the drug’s \nuse  and  distribution.  For  example,  only  doctors  could \nprescribe or supervise prescription of Mifeprex.  Doctors \nand patients also had to follow a strict regimen requiring \nthe patient to appear for three in-person visits with the \ndoctor.  And FDA directed prescribing doctors to report \nincidents of hospitalizations, blood transfusions, or other \nserious adverse events to the drug sponsor (who, in turn, \nwas required to report the events to FDA). \n  In  2015,  Mifeprex’s  distributor  Danco  Laboratories \nsubmitted a supplemental new drug application seeking to \n \n\n  Cite as:  602 U. S. ____ (2024)  3 \n \nOpinion of the Court \namend  Mifeprex’s  labeling  and  to  relax  some  of  the \nrestrictions that FDA had imposed.  In 2016, FDA approved  \nthe  proposed  changes.  FDA  deemed  Mifeprex  safe  to\nterminate pregnancies up to 10 weeks rather than 7 weeks.  \nFDA  allowed  healthcare  providers  such  as  nurse  \npractitioners to prescribe Mifeprex.  And FDA approved a\ndosing regimen that reduced the number of required in-\nperson visits from three to one—a single visit to receive \nMifeprex.  In addition, FDA changed prescribers’ adverse \nevent reporting obligations to require prescribers to report \nonly fatalities—a reporting requirement that was still more \nstringent than the requirements for most other drugs. \n  In  2019,  FDA  approved  an  application  for  generic \nmifepristone.  FDA established the same conditions of use \nfor generic mifepristone as for Mifeprex. \n  In  2021,  FDA  again  relaxed  the  requirements  for \nMifeprex and generic mifepristone.  Relying on experience \ngained during the COVID–19 pandemic about pregnant \nwomen using mifepristone without an in-person visit to a  \nhealthcare  provider,  FDA  announced  that  it  would  no \nlonger enforce the initial in-person visit requirement. \nB \n  Because mifepristone is used to terminate pregnancies,\nFDA’s  approval  and  regulation  of  mifepristone  have \ngenerated substantial controversy from the start.  In 2002,  \nthree pro-life associations submitted a joint citizen petition \nasking  FDA  to  rescind  its  approval  of  Mifeprex.  FDA \ndenied their petition.\n  In 2019, two pro-life medical associations filed another\npetition,  this  time  asking  FDA  to  withdraw  its  2016  \nmodifications  to  mifepristone’s  conditions  of  use.    FDA  \ndenied that petition as well. \n  This  case  began  in  2022.  Four  pro-life  medical\nassociations, as well as several individual doctors, sued  \nFDA in the U. S. District Court for the Northern District of  \n \n\n4  FDA v. ALLIANCE FOR HIPPOCRATIC MEDICINE  \n    \nOpinion of the Court \nTexas.  Plaintiffs brought claims under the Administrative \nProcedure Act.  They challenged the lawfulness of FDA’s \n2000 approval of Mifeprex; FDA’s 2019 approval of generic \nmifepristone; and FDA’s 2016 and 2021 actions modifying \nmifepristone’s conditions of use.  Danco Laboratories, which  \nsponsors  Mifeprex,  intervened  to  defend  FDA’s  actions.  \nThe  plaintiffs  moved  for  a  preliminary  injunction  that \nwould require FDA to rescind approval of mifepristone or, \nat the very least, to rescind FDA’s 2016 and 2021 actions. \n  The District Court agreed with the plaintiffs and in effect \nenjoined FDA’s approval of mifepristone, thereby ordering \nmifepristone off the market.  668 F. Supp. 3d 507 (ND Tex. \n2023).  The court first held that the plaintiffs possessed\nArticle III standing.  It then determined that the plaintiffs\nwere likely to succeed on the merits of each of their claims.  \nFinally, the court concluded that the plaintiffs would suffer \nirreparable  harm  from  FDA’s  continued  approval  of \nmifepristone and that an injunction would serve the public\ninterest. \n  FDA and Danco promptly appealed and moved to stay the \nDistrict Court’s order pending appeal.  The U. S. Court of \nAppeals for the Fifth Circuit granted the stay motion in \npart  and  temporarily  reinstated  FDA’s  approval  of \nMifeprex.  2023 WL 2913725, *21 (Apr. 12, 2023).  But the  \nCourt of Appeals declined to stay the rest of the District \nCourt’s order.  The Court of Appeals’ partial stay would\nhave left Mifeprex (though not generic mifepristone) on the \nmarket, but only under the more stringent requirements \nimposed  when  FDA  first  approved  Mifeprex  in  2000—\navailable only up to seven weeks of pregnancy, only when \nprescribed by doctors, and only with three in-person visits, \namong other requirements.\n  FDA and Danco then sought a full stay in this Court.  \nThis Court stayed the District Court’s order in its entirety \npending the disposition of FDA’s and Danco’s appeals in the \nCourt of Appeals and ultimate resolution by this Court.  598  \n \n\n  Cite as:  602 U. S. ____ (2024)  5 \n \nOpinion of the Court \nU. S. ___ (2023).  As a result of this Court’s stay, Mifeprex \nand  generic  mifepristone  have  remained  available  as  \nallowed by FDA’s relaxed 2016 and 2021 requirements.\n  A  few  months  later,  the  Court  of  Appeals  issued  its \ndecision  on  the  merits  of  the  District  Court’s  order,  \naffirming in part and vacating in part.  78 F. 4th 210, 222– \n223 (CA5 2023).  The Court of Appeals first concluded that \nthe individual doctors and the pro-life medical associations \nhad standing.  The Court of Appeals next concluded that \nplaintiffs were not likely to succeed on their  challenge to \nFDA’s 2000 approval of Mifeprex and 2019 approval of \ngeneric mifepristone.  So the Court of Appeals vacated the \nDistrict Court’s order as to those agency actions.  But the \nCourt  of  Appeals  agreed  with  the  District  Court  that \nplaintiffs were likely to succeed in showing that FDA’s 2016 \nand 2021 actions were unlawful. \n  The Court of Appeals’ merits decision did not alter this \nCourt’s  stay  of  the  District  Court’s  order  pending  this\nCourt’s review.  This Court then granted certiorari with \nrespect to the 2016 and 2021 FDA actions held unlawful by \nthe Court of Appeals.  601 U. S. ___ (2023). \nII  \n  The threshold question is whether the plaintiffs have\nstanding  to  sue  under  Article  III  of  the  Constitution.  \nArticle  III  standing  is  a  “bedrock   constitutional  \nrequirement that this Court has applied to all manner of \nimportant disputes.” United States v. Texas, 599 U. S. 670, \n675 (2023).  Standing is “built on  a single basic idea—the \nidea  of  separation  of  powers.”    Ibid.  (quotation  marks \nomitted).  Importantly,  separation  of  powers  “was  not \nsimply  an  abstract  generalization  in  the  minds  of  the\nFramers: it was woven into the document that they drafted \nin Philadelphia in the summer of 1787.”  TransUnion LLC  \nv. Ramirez, 594 U. S. 413, 422–423 (2021) (quotation marks \nomitted).  Therefore, we begin as always with the precise \n \n\n6  FDA v. ALLIANCE FOR HIPPOCRATIC MEDICINE  \n    \nOpinion of the Court \ntext of the Constitution. \n  Article III of the Constitution confines the jurisdiction of \nfederal courts to “Cases” and “Controversies.”  The case or  \ncontroversy  requirement  limits  the  role  of  the  Federal \nJudiciary in our system of separated powers.  As this Court  \nexplained  to  President  George  Washington  in  1793  in \nresponse to his request for a legal opinion, federal courts do \nnot  issue  advisory  opinions  about  the  law—even  when \nrequested  by  the  President.  13  Papers  of  George\nWashington: Presidential Series 392 (C. Patrick ed. 2007).  \nNor do federal courts operate as an open forum for citizens \n“to  press  general  complaints  about  the  way  in  which \ngovernment goes about its business.”  Allen v. Wright, 468  \nU. S.  737,  760  (1984)  (quotation  marks  omitted);  see \nCalifornia v. Texas, 593 U. S. 659, 673 (2021); Valley Forge \nChristian College v. Americans United for Separation of \nChurch and State, Inc., 454 U. S. 464, 487 (1982); United  \nStates v. Richardson, 418 U. S. 166, 175 (1974); Ex parte  \nLevitt,  302  U. S.  633,  634  (1937)  (per curiam); \nMassachusetts v. Mellon, 262 U. S. 447, 487–488 (1923);  \nFairchild v.  Hughes, 258 U. S. 126, 129–130 (1922). \n  As Justice Scalia memorably said, Article III requires a\nplaintiff to first answer a basic question:  “‘What’s it to  \n \nyou?’”  A. Scalia, The Doctrine of Standing as an Essential \n \nElement of the Separation of Powers, 17 Suffolk U. L. Rev. \n881,  882  (1983).    For  a  plaintiff  to  get  in  the  federal\ncourthouse door and obtain a judicial determination of what \nthe  governing  law  is,  the  plaintiff  cannot  be  a  mere \nbystander, but instead must have a “personal stake” in the \ndispute.  TransUnion, 594 U. S., at 423.  The requirement \nthat the plaintiff possess a personal stake helps ensure that \ncourts decide litigants’ legal rights in specific cases, as\nArticle III requires, and that courts do not opine on legal \nissues in response to citizens who might “roam the country \nin search of governmental wrongdoing.”  Valley Forge,  454 \nU. S., at 487; see, e.g., Schlesinger v. Reservists Comm. to \n \n\n  Cite as:  602 U. S. ____ (2024)  7 \n \nOpinion of the Court \nStop the War, 418 U. S. 208, 227 (1974); Richardson, 418  \nU. S., at 175; Tyler v. Judges of Court of Registration, 179 \nU. S. 405, 406 (1900).  Standing also “tends to assure that \nthe legal questions presented to the court will be resolved, \nnot in the rarified atmosphere of a debating society, but in  \na  concrete  factual  context  conducive  to  a  realistic \nappreciation of the consequences of judicial action.”  Valley \nForge, 454 U. S., at 472.  Moreover, the standing doctrine\nserves to protect the “autonomy” of those who are most  \ndirectly affected so that they  can decide whether and how \nto challenge the defendant’s action.  Id., at 473. \n  By  limiting  who  can  sue,  the  standing  requirement\nimplements  “the  Framers’  concept  of  the  proper—and\nproperly limited—role of the courts in a democratic society.”  \nJ. Roberts, Article III Limits on Statutory Standing, 42 \nDuke L. J. 1219, 1220 (1993) (quotation marks omitted).  In  \nparticular,  the  standing  requirement  means  that  the \nfederal courts decide some contested legal questions later \nrather than sooner, thereby allowing issues to percolate and \npotentially  be  resolved  by  the  political  branches  in  the \ndemocratic process.  See Raines v. Byrd, 521 U. S. 811, 829– \n830 (1997); cf. Clapper v. Amnesty Int’l USA, 568 U. S. 398, \n420–422 (2013). And the standing requirement means that \nthe federal courts may  never need to decide some contested \nlegal questions:  “Our system of government leaves many  \ncrucial  decisions  to  the  political  processes,”  where  \ndemocratic debate can occur and a wide variety of interests \nand views can be weighed.  Schlesinger, 418 U. S., at 227;  \nsee Campbell v. Clinton, 203 F. 3d 19, 23 (CADC 2000).  \nA \n  The fundamentals of standing are well-known and firmly \nrooted  in  American  constitutional  law.  To  establish \nstanding, as this Court has often stated, a plaintiff must \ndemonstrate (i) that she has suffered or likely will suffer an \ninjury in fact, (ii) that the injury likely was caused or will \n \n\n8  FDA v. ALLIANCE FOR HIPPOCRATIC MEDICINE  \n    \nOpinion of the Court \nbe caused by the defendant, and (iii) that the injury likely \nwould be redressed by the requested judicial relief.  See \nSummers  v.  Earth  Island  Institute,  555  U. S.  488,  493 \n(2009); Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U. S. 555, 560– \n561  (1992).  Those  specific  standing  requirements \nconstitute “an essential and unchanging part of the case-or-\ncontroversy requirement of Article III.”  Id., at 560. \n  The second and third standing requirements—causation \nand redressability—are often “flip sides of the same coin.”  \nSprint Communications Co. v.  APCC Services, Inc., 554  \nU. S. 269, 288 (2008).  If a defendant’s action causes an \ninjury, enjoining the action or awarding damages for the \naction will typically redress that injury.  So the two key \nquestions in most standing disputes are injury in fact and \ncausation.1  \n  First  is  injury  in  fact.  An  injury  in  fact  must  be\n“concrete,” meaning that it must be real and not abstract.  \nSee TransUnion, 594 U.  S., at 424.  The injury also must be \nparticularized; the injury must affect “the plaintiff in a \npersonal and individual way” and not be a generalized\ngrievance.  Lujan, 504 U. S., at 560, n. 1.  An injury in fact \ncan be a physical injury, a monetary injury, an injury to \none’s property, or an injury to one’s constitutional rights, to \ntake just a few common examples.  Moreover, the injury \nmust be actual or imminent, not speculative—meaning that \nthe injury must have already occurred or be likely to occur \nsoon. Clapper, 568 U. S., at 409.  And when a plaintiff seeks \nprospective relief such as an injunction, the plaintiff must \nestablish a sufficient likelihood of future injury.  Id., at 401.  \n  By requiring the plaintiff to show an injury in fact, Article  \n—————— \n1Redressability can still pose an independent bar in some cases.  For \n \nexample, a plaintiff who suffers injuries caused by the government still  \nmay not be able to sue because the case may not be of the kind \n“traditionally redressable in federal court.”  United States  v.  Texas, 599 \nU. S. 670, 676 (2023); cf. California v. Texas, 593 U. S. 659, 671–672  \n(2021).  \n \n\n  Cite as:  602 U. S. ____ (2024)  9 \n \nOpinion of the Court \nIII standing screens out plaintiffs who might have only a \ngeneral legal, moral, ideological, or policy objection to a \nparticular government action.  For example, a citizen does\nnot have standing to challenge a government regulation \nsimply because the plaintiff believes that the government \nis acting illegally.  See Valley Forge, 454 U. S., at 473, 487.   \nA citizen may not sue based only on an “asserted right to \nhave the Government act in accordance with law.”  Allen, \n468 U. S., at 754; Schlesinger, 418 U. S., at 225–227.  Nor \nmay citizens sue merely because their legal objection is\naccompanied  by  a  strong  moral,  ideological,  or  policy\nobjection to a government action.  See Valley Forge, 454  \nU. S., at 473. \n  The  injury  in  fact  requirement  prevents  the  federal \ncourts from becoming a “vehicle for the vindication of the \nvalue interests of concerned bystanders.”  Allen, 468 U. S., \nat 756 (quotation marks omitted).  An Article III court is \nnot  a  legislative  assembly,  a  town  square,  or  a  faculty \nlounge.  Article III does not contemplate a system where\n330 million citizens can come to federal court whenever \nthey believe that the government is acting contrary to the \nConstitution  or  other  federal  law.    See  id.,  at  754.   \nVindicating  “the  public  interest  (including  the  public\ninterest in Government observance of the Constitution and  \nlaws) is the function of Congress and the Chief Executive.”  \nLujan, 504 U. S., at 576. \n  In sum, to sue in federal court, a plaintiff must show that\nhe or she has suffered or likely will suffer an injury in fact. \n  Second is causation.  The plaintiff must also establish \nthat the plaintiff ’s injury likely was caused or likely will be \n \ncaused by the defendant’s conduct. \n  Government  regulations  that  require  or  forbid  some \naction by the plaintiff almost invariably satisfy both the \ninjury in fact and causation requirements.  So in those  \ncases, standing is usually easy to establish.  See Lujan, 504 \nU. S.,  at  561–562;  see,  e.g.,  Susan  B.  Anthony  List  v.  \n \n\n10  FDA v. ALLIANCE FOR HIPPOCRATIC MEDICINE  \n    \nOpinion of the Court \nDriehaus, 573 U. S. 149, 162–163 (2014). \n  By contrast, when (as here) a plaintiff challenges the \ngovernment’s “unlawful regulation  (or lack of regulation) of  \nsomeone else,” “standing is not precluded, but it is ordinarily \nsubstantially more difficult to establish.” Lujan, 504 U. S.,  \nat 562 (quotation marks omitted); see Summers, 555 U. S., \nat 493. That is often because unregulated parties may have \nmore  difficulty  establishing  causation—that  is,  linking\ntheir asserted injuries to the government’s regulation (or \nlack of regulation) of someone else. See Clapper, 568 U. S., \nat 413–414; Lujan, 504 U. S., at 562; Duke Power Co. v. \nCarolina Environmental Study Group, Inc., 438 U. S. 59, 74  \n(1978); Simon v. Eastern Ky. Welfare Rights Organization, \n426 U. S. 26, 41–46 (1976); Warth v. Seldin, 422 U. S. 490, \n504–508 (1975).\n  When the plaintiff is an unregulated party, causation  \n“ordinarily hinge[s] on the response of the regulated (or \nregulable)  third  party  to  the  government  action  or \ninaction—and perhaps on the response of others as well.”  \nLujan, 504 U. S., at 562.  Yet the Court has said that \nplaintiffs attempting to show causation generally cannot \n“rely on speculation about the unfettered choices made by \nindependent actors not before the courts.”  Clapper, 568 \nU. S.,  at  415,  n. 5  (quotation  marks  omitted);  see  also \nBennett v. Spear, 520 U.  S. 154, 168–169 (1997).  Therefore, \nto thread the causation needle in those circumstances, the  \nplaintiff must show that the “ ‘third parties will likely react \n \nin predictable ways’” that in turn will likely injure the\n \nplaintiffs.  California,  593  U. S.,  at  675  (quoting \nDepartment of Commerce v. New York, 588 U. S. 752, 768 \n(2019)).\n  As  this  Court  has  explained,  the  “line  of   causation  \nbetween the illegal conduct and injury”—the “links in the \nchain of causation,” Allen, 468 U. S., at 752, 759—must not \nbe too speculative or too attenuated, Clapper, 568 U. S., at  \n410–411. The causation requirement precludes speculative \n \n\n  Cite as:  602 U. S. ____ (2024)  11  \n \nOpinion of the Court \nlinks—that is, where it is not sufficiently predictable how \nthird parties would react to government action or cause \ndownstream injury to plaintiffs.  See Allen, 468 U. S., at \n757–759;  Simon,  426  U. S.,  at  41–46.  The  causation  \nrequirement also rules out attenuated links—that is, where \nthe government action is so far removed from its distant \n(even if predictable) ripple effects that the plaintiffs cannot \nestablish Article III standing.  See Allen, 468 U. S., at 757– \n759; cf. Department of Commerce, 588 U. S., at 768. \n  The  causation  requirement  is  central  to  Article  III \nstanding. Like the injury in fact requirement, the causation \nrequirement screens out plaintiffs who were not injured by \nthe defendant’s action. Without the causation requirement,  \ncourts  would  be  “virtually  continuing  monitors  of  the \nwisdom and soundness” of government action.  Allen, 468 \nU. S., at 760 (quotation marks omitted). \n  Determining  causation  in  cases  involving  suits  by\nunregulated parties against the government is admittedly \nnot a “mechanical exercise.”  Id., at 751.  That is because \nthe causation inquiry can be heavily fact-dependent and a  \n“question of degree,” as private petitioner’s counsel aptly\ndescribed it here.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 50.  Unfortunately, \napplying the law of standing cannot be made easy, and that \nis particularly true for causation.  Just as causation in tort  \nlaw can pose line-drawing difficulties, so too can causation \nin standing law when determining whether an unregulated \nparty has standing.\n  That said, the “absence of precise definitions” has not left \ncourts entirely “at sea in applying the law of standing.”   \nAllen, 468 U. S., at 751.  Like “most legal notions, the\nstanding concepts have gained considerable definition from \ndeveloping case law.”  Ibid.  As the Court has explained, in \n“many cases the standing question can be answered chiefly \nby comparing the allegations of the particular complaint to \nthose  made  in  prior  standing  cases.”    Id.,  at  751–752.   \nStated otherwise, assessing standing “in a particular case  \n \n\n12  FDA v. ALLIANCE FOR HIPPOCRATIC MEDICINE  \n    \nOpinion of the Court \nmay be facilitated by clarifying principles or even clear\nrules developed in prior cases.”  Id., at 752. \n  Consistent  with  that  understanding  of  how  standing \nprinciples can develop and solidify, the Court has identified \na  variety  of  familiar  circumstances  where  government \nregulation of a third-party individual or business may be \nlikely to cause injury in fact to an unregulated plaintiff. For \nexample,  when  the  government  regulates  (or  under-\nregulates) a business, the regulation (or lack thereof ) may\n \ncause downstream or upstream economic injuries to others\nin  the  chain,  such  as  certain  manufacturers,  retailers,  \nsuppliers, competitors, or customers.  E.g., National Credit  \nUnion Admin. v. First Nat. Bank & Trust Co., 522 U. S. 479, \n488, n. 4 (1998); General Motors Corp. v. Tracy, 519 U. S.  \n278, 286–287 (1997); Barlow v. Collins, 397 U. S. 159, 162– \n164  (1970);  Association  of  Data  Processing  Service  \nOrganizations, Inc. v.  Camp, 397 U. S. 150, 152 (1970).  \nWhen the government regulates parks, national forests,  or \nbodies of water, for example, the regulation may cause \nharm to individual users.  E.g., Summers, 555 U. S., at 494.   \nWhen  the  government  regulates  one  property,  it  may \nreduce the value of adjacent property.  The list goes on.  See, \ne.g., Department of Commerce, 588 U. S., at 766–768. \n  As  those  cases  illustrate,  to  establish  causation,  the \nplaintiff must show a predictable chain of events leading \nfrom the government action to the asserted injury—in other \nwords, that the government action has caused or likely will \ncause injury in fact to the plaintiff.2  \n—————— \n2In  cases  of  alleged  future  injuries  to  unregulated  parties  from \n \ngovernment regulation, the causation requirement and the imminence \nelement of the injury in fact requirement can overlap.  Both target the \nsame issue:   Is it likely that the  government’s regulation or lack of\nregulation of someone else will cause a concrete and particularized injury \nin fact to the unregulated plaintiff?  \n \n\n  Cite as:  602 U. S. ____ (2024)  13  \n \nOpinion of the Court \nB \n  Here, the plaintiff doctors and medical associations are \nunregulated parties who seek to challenge FDA’s regulation \nof  others.  Specifically, FDA’s regulations apply to doctors \nprescribing mifepristone and to pregnant women taking\nmifepristone.  But  the  plaintiff  doctors  and  medical \nassociations do not prescribe or use mifepristone.  And FDA \nhas not required the plaintiffs to do anything or to refrain \nfrom doing anything.\n  The plaintiffs do not allege the kinds of injuries described \nabove that unregulated parties sometimes can assert to \ndemonstrate  causation.  Because  the  plaintiffs  do  not\nprescribe, manufacture, sell, or advertise mifepristone or\nsponsor a competing drug, the plaintiffs suffer no direct \nmonetary injuries from FDA’s actions relaxing regulation of \nmifepristone.  Nor do they suffer injuries to their property, \nor  to  the  value  of  their  property,  from  FDA’s  actions.  \nBecause  the  plaintiffs  do  not  use  mifepristone,  they \nobviously can suffer no physical injuries from FDA’s actions \nrelaxing regulation of mifepristone. \n  Rather, the plaintiffs say that they are pro-life, oppose \nelective abortion, and have sincere legal, moral, ideological, \nand policy objections to mifepristone being prescribed and \nused by others. The plaintiffs appear to recognize that those \ngeneral legal, moral, ideological, and policy concerns do not \nsuffice on their own to confer Article III standing to sue in \nfederal court.  So to try to establish standing, the plaintiffs \nadvance several complicated causation theories to connect \nFDA’s actions to the plaintiffs’ alleged injuries in fact. \n  The first set of causation theories contends that FDA’s  \nrelaxed regulation of mifepristone may cause downstream \nconscience injuries to the individual doctor plaintiffs and \nthe specified members of the plaintiff medical associations, \nwho are also doctors.  (We will refer to them collectively as \n“the doctors.”)  The second set of causation theories asserts  \nthat FDA’s relaxed regulation of mifepristone may cause \n \n\n14  FDA v. ALLIANCE FOR HIPPOCRATIC MEDICINE  \n    \nOpinion of the Court \ndownstream economic injuries to the doctors.  The third set  \nof  causation  theories  maintains  that  FDA’s  relaxed \nregulation of mifepristone causes injuries to the medical \nassociations  themselves,  who  assert  their  own \norganizational standing.  As we will explain, none of the \ntheories suffices to establish Article III standing. \n1 \n  We first address the plaintiffs’ claim that FDA’s relaxed \nregulation of mifepristone causes conscience injuries to the \ndoctors. \n  The doctors contend that FDA’s 2016 and 2021 actions  \nwill cause more pregnant women to suffer complications \nfrom mifepristone, and those women in turn will need more \nemergency abortions by doctors.  The plaintiff doctors say \nthat  they  therefore  may  be  required—against  their \nconsciences—to  render  emergency  treatment  completing  \nthe  abortions  or  providing  other  abortion-related \ntreatment.  \n  The  Government  correctly  acknowledges  that  a  \nconscience injury of that kind constitutes a concrete injury  \nin fact for purposes of Article III.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 11–\n12; TransUnion,  594 U.  S., at 425; see, e.g., Holt v. Hobbs, \n574 U. S. 352 (2015).  So doctors would have standing to\nchallenge a government action that likely would cause them \nto provide medical treatment against their consciences. \n  But in this case—even assuming for the sake of argument \nthat  FDA’s  2016  and  2021  changes  to  mifepristone’s \nconditions of use cause more pregnant women to require \nemergency abortions and that some women would likely \nseek treatment from these plaintiff doctors—the plaintiff \ndoctors  have  not  shown  that  they  could  be  forced  to \nparticipate  in  an  abortion  or  provide  abortion-related\nmedical treatment over their conscience objections.\n  That is because, as the Government explains, federal \nconscience  laws  definitively  protect  doctors  from  being  \n \n\n  Cite as:  602 U. S. ____ (2024)  15  \n \nOpinion of the Court \nrequired to perform abortions or to provide other treatment \nthat violates their consciences.  See 42 U.  S. C. §300a–\n7(c)(1); see also H. R. 4366, 118th Cong., 2d Sess., Div. C, \nTitle  II,  §203  (2024).  The  Church  Amendments,  for \ninstance,  speak  clearly.    They  allow  doctors  and  other\nhealthcare personnel to “refus[e] to perform or assist” an \nabortion without punishment or discrimination from their\nemployers.  42 U. S. C. §300a–7(c)(1).  And the Church  \nAmendments more broadly provide that doctors shall not be \nrequired  to  provide  treatment  or  assistance  that  would \nviolate the doctors’ religious beliefs or moral convictions.  \n§300a–7(d).  Most if not all States have conscience laws to \nthe same effect.  See N. Sawicki, Protections From Civil  \nLiability in State Abortion Conscience Laws, 322 JAMA \n1918 (2019); see, e.g., Tex. Occ. Code Ann. §103.001 (West \n2022).\n  Moreover, as the Government notes, federal conscience  \nprotections  encompass  “the  doctor’s  beliefs  rather  than \nparticular  procedures,”  meaning  that  doctors  cannot  be  \nrequired to treat mifepristone complications in any way \nthat would violate the doctors’ consciences.  Tr. of Oral Arg.  \n37; see §300a–7(c)(1).  As the Government points out, that \nstrong protection for conscience remains true even in a so-\ncalled  healthcare  desert,  where  other  doctors  are  not \nreadily available.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 18. \n  Not only as a matter of law but also as a matter of fact, \nthe federal conscience laws have protected pro-life doctors \never  since  FDA  approved  mifepristone  in  2000.  The \nplaintiffs have not identified any instances where a doctor \nwas  required,  notwithstanding  conscience  objections,  to \nperform an abortion or to provide other abortion-related \ntreatment that violated the doctor’s conscience.  Nor is  \nthere any evidence in the record here of hospitals overriding \nor failing to accommodate doctors’ conscience objections. \n  In other words, none of the doctors’ declarations says \nanything  like  the  following:    “Here  is  the  treatment  I  \n \n\n16  FDA v. ALLIANCE FOR HIPPOCRATIC MEDICINE  \n    \nOpinion of the Court \nprovided, here is how it violated my conscience, and here is \nwhy the conscience protections were unavailable to me.”  Cf.  \nApp.  153–154  (Dr.  Francis  saw  a  patient  suffering\ncomplications from an abortion drug obtained from India;\nno allegation that Dr. Francis helped perform an abortion); \nid., at 154 (Dr. Francis witnessed another doctor perform \nan  abortion;  no  allegation  that  the  other  doctor  raised  \nconscience objections or tried not to participate);  id., at 163– \n164  (doctor’s  hospital  treated  women  suffering\ncomplications from abortion drugs; no allegation that the \ndoctors  treating  the  patients  had  or  raised  conscience\nobjections to the treatment they provided); id., at 173–174  \n(doctor  treated  a  patient  suffering  from  mifepristone\ncomplications;  no  description  of  what  that  treatment  \ninvolved  and  no  statement  that  the  doctor  raised  a \nconscience objection to providing that treatment). \n  In response to all of that, the doctors still express fear \nthat  another  federal  law,  the  Emergency  Medical \nTreatment  and  Labor  Act  or  EMTALA,  might  be  \ninterpreted to override those federal conscience laws and to \nrequire individual emergency room doctors to participate in  \nemergency  abortions  in  some  circumstances.    See  42 \nU. S. C. §1395dd.  But the Government has disclaimed that \nreading of EMTALA.  And we agree with the Government’s \nview of EMTALA on that point.  EMTALA does not require \ndoctors to perform abortions or provide abortion-related \nmedical treatment over their conscience objections because \nEMTALA does not impose obligations on individual doctors.  \nSee  Brief  for  United  States  23,  n. 3.    As  the  Solicitor \nGeneral succinctly and correctly stated, EMTALA does not \n“override an individual doctor’s conscience objections.”  Tr. \nof Oral Arg. 18; see also Tr. of Oral Arg. in  Moyle v. United  \nStates, O. T. 2023, No.  23–726 etc., pp. 88–91 (Moyle Tr.).\nWe agree with the Solicitor General’s representation that \nfederal conscience protections provide “broad coverage” and \nwill “shield a doctor who doesn’t want to provide care in \n \n\n  Cite as:  602 U. S. ____ (2024)  17  \n \nOpinion of the Court \nviolation of those protections.”  Tr. of Oral Arg. 18, 36. \n  The doctors say, however, that emergency room doctors  \nsummoned to provide emergency treatment may not have \ntime to invoke federal conscience protections.  But as the \nGovernment correctly explained,  doctors need not follow a  \ntime-intensive  procedure  to  invoke  federal  conscience \nprotections.  Reply Brief for United States 5.   A doctor may \nsimply  refuse;  federal  law  protects  doctors  from  \nrepercussions when they have “refused” to participate in an \nabortion.  §300a–7(c)(1); Reply Brief for United States 5.   \nAnd  as  the  Government  states,  “[h]ospitals  must \naccommodate doctors in emergency rooms no less than in \nother  contexts.”  Ibid.    For  that  reason,  hospitals  and\ndoctors typically try to plan ahead for how to deal with a \ndoctor’s absence due to conscience objections.  Tr. of Oral \nArg. 18; Moyle Tr. 89–90.  And again, nothing in the record \nsince 2000 supports plaintiffs’ speculation that doctors will \nbe  unable  to  successfully  invoke  federal  conscience \nprotections in emergency circumstances. \n  In short, given the broad and comprehensive conscience \nprotections guaranteed by federal law, the plaintiffs have\nnot  shown—and  cannot  show—that  FDA’s  actions  will \ncause them to suffer any conscience injury.  Federal law \nfully  protects  doctors  against  being  required  to  provide \nabortions  or  other  medical  treatment  against  their \nconsciences—and therefore breaks any chain of causation \nbetween FDA’s relaxed regulation of mifepristone and any \nasserted conscience injuries to the doctors.3  \n—————— \n3The doctors also suggest that they are distressed by others’  use of \n \nmifepristone and by emergency abortions. It is not clear that this alleged \ninjury is distinct from the alleged conscience injury.  But even if it is, this  \nCourt has long made clear  that distress  at or disagreement with the \nactivities of others is not a basis under Article III for a plaintiff to bring \na federal lawsuit challenging the legality of a government regulation \nallowing those activities.  See, e.g.,  Valley Forge Christian College v.  \nAmericans United for Separation of Church and State,  Inc., 454 U. S.  \n464, 473, 485–486 (1982); United States v. Richardson, 418 U. S. 166, \n \n\n18  FDA v. ALLIANCE FOR HIPPOCRATIC MEDICINE  \n    \nOpinion of the Court \n2 \n  In addition to alleging conscience injuries, the doctors cite \nvarious monetary and related injuries that they allegedly \nwill  suffer  as  a  result  of  FDA’s  actions—in  particular,\ndiverting resources and time from other patients to treat \npatients with mifepristone complications; increasing risk of \nliability suits from treating those patients; and potentially \nincreasing insurance costs.\n  Those  standing  allegations  suffer  from  the  same  \nproblem—a lack of causation.  The causal link between  \nFDA’s regulatory actions and those alleged injuries is too \nspeculative  or  otherwise  too  attenuated  to  establish  \nstanding. \n  To begin with, the claim that the doctors will incur those \ninjuries  as  a  result  of  FDA’s  2016  and  2021  relaxed \nregulations lacks record support and is highly speculative.  \nThe doctors have not offered evidence tending to suggest \nthat  FDA’s  deregulatory  actions  have  both  caused  an\nincrease  in  the  number  of  pregnant  women  seeking \ntreatment from the plaintiff doctors  and caused a resulting \ndiversion of the doctors’ time and resources from other \npatients.  Moreover, the doctors have not identified any \ninstances in the past where they have been sued or required \nto pay higher insurance costs because they have treated \npregnant women suffering mifepristone complications.  Nor \nhave  the  plaintiffs  offered  any  persuasive  evidence  or \nreason to believe that the future will be different. \n  In any event, and perhaps more to the point, the law has \nnever  permitted  doctors  to  challenge  the  government’s \nloosening  of  general  public  safety  requirements  simply \nbecause more individuals might then show up at emergency\nrooms or in doctors’ offices with follow-on injuries.  Stated  \notherwise,  there  is  no  Article  III  doctrine  of  “doctor  \nstanding”  that  allows  doctors  to  challenge  general  \n—————— \n175 (1974); Sierra Club  v.  Morton, 405 U. S. 727, 739 (1972). \n \n\n  Cite as:  602 U. S. ____ (2024)  19  \n \nOpinion of the Court \ngovernment safety regulations.  Nor will this Court now \ncreate such a novel standing doctrine out of whole cloth. \n  Consider  some  examples.  EPA  rolls  back   emissions  \nstandards for power plants—does a doctor have standing to \nsue because she may need to spend more time treating \nasthma patients?  A local school district starts a middle \nschool football league—does a pediatrician have standing to \nchallenge its constitutionality because she might need to \nspend more time treating concussions?  A federal agency \nincreases a speed limit from 65 to 80 miles per hour—does \nan emergency room doctor have standing to sue because he \nmay  have  to  treat  more  car  accident  victims?    The  \ngovernment repeals certain restrictions on guns—does a \nsurgeon have standing to sue because he might have to \noperate on more gunshot victims? \n  The answer is no:  The chain of causation is simply too  \nattenuated. Allowing doctors or other healthcare providers \nto challenge general safety regulations as unlawfully lax \nwould be an unprecedented and limitless approach and \nwould allow doctors to sue in federal court to challenge \nalmost any policy affecting public health.4  \n  And in the FDA drug-approval context, virtually all drugs \ncome with complications, risks, and side effects.  Some  \ndrugs increase the risk of heart attack, some may cause \ncancer, some may cause birth defects, and some heighten \nthe possibility of stroke.  Approval of a new drug may \ntherefore yield more visits to doctors to treat complications \nor side effects.  So the plaintiffs’ loose approach to causation \nwould  also  essentially  allow  any  doctor  or  healthcare \nprovider to challenge any FDA decision approving a new \ndrug.  But doctors have never had standing to challenge \nFDA’s drug approvals simply on the theory that use of the \n—————— \n4A safety law regulating hospitals or the doctors’ medical practices \n \nobviously would present a different issue—either such a law would  \ndirectly  regulate  doctors,   or  the  causal  link  at  least  would  be  \nsubstantially less attenuated.  \n \n\n20  FDA v. ALLIANCE FOR HIPPOCRATIC MEDICINE  \n    \nOpinion of the Court \ndrugs by others may cause more visits to doctors. \n  And if we were now to  invent a new doctrine of doctor \nstanding, there would be no principled way to cabin such a \nsweeping doctrinal change to doctors or other healthcare \nproviders.  Firefighters  could  sue  to  object  to  relaxed \nbuilding codes that increase fire risks.  Police officers could  \nsue to challenge a government decision to legalize certain \nactivities  that  are  associated  with  increased  crime.  \nTeachers in border states could sue to challenge allegedly\nlax  immigration  policies  that  lead  to  overcrowded  \nclassrooms.  \n  We  decline  to  start  the  Federal  Judiciary  down  that  \nuncharted path.  That path would seemingly not end until\nvirtually every citizen had standing to challenge virtually\nevery government action that they do not like—an approach \nto standing that this Court has consistently rejected as  \nflatly inconsistent with Article III. \n  We recognize that many citizens, including the plaintiff\ndoctors here, have sincere concerns about and objections to\nothers using mifepristone and obtaining abortions.  But \ncitizens and doctors do not have standing to sue simply \nbecause others are allowed to engage in certain activities—\nat  least  without  the  plaintiffs  demonstrating  how  they \nwould  be  injured  by  the  government’s  alleged  under-\nregulation of others.  See Coalition for Mercury-Free Drugs  \nv. Sebelius, 671 F. 3d 1275, 1277 (CADC 2012).  Citizens  \nand doctors who object to what the law allows others to do \nmay  always  take  their  concerns  to  the  Executive  and  \nLegislative  Branches  and  seek  greater  regulatory  or\nlegislative restrictions on certain activities.\n  In sum, the doctors in this case have failed to establish \nArticle III standing.  The doctors have not shown that \nFDA’s actions likely will cause them any injury in fact.  The \nasserted  causal  link  is  simply  too  speculative  or  too \n \n\n  Cite as:  602 U. S. ____ (2024)  21  \n \nOpinion of the Court \nattenuated to support Article III standing.5  \n3 \n  That leaves the medical associations’ argument that the \nassociations  themselves  have  organizational  standing.  \nUnder  this  Court’s  precedents,  organizations  may  have \nstanding “to sue on their own behalf for injuries they have \nsustained.” Havens Realty Corp. v.  Coleman, 455 U. S. 363,  \n379, n. 19 (1982).  In doing so, however, organizations must \nsatisfy the usual standards for injury in fact, causation, and \nredressability that apply to individuals.  Id., at 378–379. \n  According  to  the  medical  associations,  FDA  has  \n“impaired” their “ability to provide services and achieve \ntheir organizational missions.”  Brief for Respondents 43.  \nThat argument does not work to demonstrate standing. \n  Like an individual, an organization may not establish\nstanding simply based on the “intensity of the litigant’s \ninterest”  or  because  of  strong  opposition  to  the  \ngovernment’s conduct, Valley Forge, 454 U. S., at 486, “no \nmatter how longstanding the interest and no matter how\nqualified  the  organization,”  Sierra  Club  v.   Morton,  405  \nU. S. 727, 739 (1972).  A plaintiff must show “far more than \nsimply  a  setback  to  the  organization’s  abstract  social  \ninterests.”  Havens,  455  U. S.,  at  379.  The  plaintiff \n—————— \n5The doctors also suggest that they can sue in a representative \n \ncapacity to vindicate their patients’ injuries or potential future injuries, \neven if the doctors have not suffered and would not suffer an injury \nthemselves.  This Court has repeatedly rejected such arguments. Under \nthis Court’s precedents, third-party standing, as some have called it,  \nallows a narrow class of litigants to assert the legal rights of others. See  \nHollingsworth v. Perry, 570 U. S. 693, 708 (2013).  But “even when we \nhave allowed litigants to assert the interests of others, the litigants \nthemselves still must have suffered an injury in fact, thus giving them a \nsufficiently concrete interest in the  outcome of the issue in dispute.”  Ibid. \n(quotation marks and alterations omitted).  The third-party standing  \ndoctrine does not allow doctors to  shoehorn themselves into Article III  \nstanding simply by showing that their  patients have suffered injuries or \nmay suffer future injuries. \n \n\n22  FDA v. ALLIANCE FOR HIPPOCRATIC MEDICINE  \n    \nOpinion of the Court \nassociations  therefore  cannot  assert  standing  simply\nbecause they object to FDA’s actions. \n  The  medical  associations  say  that  they  have  \ndemonstrated something more here.  They claim to have \nstanding not based on their mere disagreement with FDA’s \npolicies, but based on their incurring costs to oppose FDA’s \nactions.  They say that  FDA has “caused” the associations \nto conduct their own studies on mifepristone so that the \nassociations  can  better  inform  their  members  and  the  \npublic about mifepristone’s risks.  Brief for Respondents 43.  \nThey contend that FDA has “forced” the associations to \n“expend considerable time, energy, and resources” drafting \ncitizen petitions to FDA, as well as engaging in public \nadvocacy and public education.  Id., at 44 (quotation marks \nomitted).  And all of  that has caused the associations to  \nspend “considerable resources” to the detriment of other \nspending priorities.  Ibid.  \n  But an organization that has not suffered a concrete  \ninjury caused by a defendant’s action cannot spend its way \ninto  standing  simply  by  expending  money  to  gather\ninformation and advocate against the defendant’s action.  \nAn organization cannot manufacture its own standing in \nthat way. \n  The  medical  associations  respond  that  under  Havens  \nRealty  Corp.  v.  Coleman,  standing  exists  when  an  \norganization  diverts  its  resources  in  response  to  a  \ndefendant’s  actions.  455  U. S.  363.    That  is  incorrect.   \nIndeed, that theory would mean that all the organizations \nin America would have standing to challenge almost every \nfederal policy that they dislike, provided they spend a single \ndollar opposing those policies.  Havens does not support \nsuch an expansive theory of standing. \n  The relevant question in Havens  was whether a housing\ncounseling organization, HOME, had standing to bring a \nclaim under the Fair Housing Act against Havens Realty, \nwhich owned and operated apartment complexes.  Id., at \n \n\n  Cite as:  602 U. S. ____ (2024)  23  \n \nOpinion of the Court \n368, 378.  Havens had provided HOME’s black employees \nfalse information about apartment availability—a practice \nknown  as   racial  steering.  Id.,  at  366,  and  n. 1,  368.  \nCritically,  HOME  not  only  was  an  issue-advocacy\norganization,  but  also  operated  a  housing  counseling \nservice.  Id., at 368.  And when Havens gave HOME’s \nemployees false information about apartment availability, \nHOME sued Havens because Havens “perceptibly impaired\nHOME’s ability to provide counseling and referral services \nfor low- and moderate-income homeseekers.”  Id., at 379. In \nother  words,  Havens’s  actions  directly   affected  and  \ninterfered  with  HOME’s  core  business  activities—not  \ndissimilar to a retailer who sues a manufacturer for selling\ndefective goods to the retailer.\n  That  is  not  the  kind  of  injury  that  the  medical \nassociations  have  alleged  here.    FDA’s  actions  relaxing \nregulation of mifepristone have not imposed any similar \nimpediment  to  the  medical  associations’  advocacy  \nbusinesses.  \n  At most, the medical associations suggest that FDA is not \nproperly collecting and disseminating information about \nmifepristone, which the associations say in turn makes it \nmore difficult for them to inform the public about safety \nrisks.  But  the  associations  have  not  claimed  an \ninformational injury, and in any event the associations \nhave  not  suggested  that  federal  law  requires  FDA  to  \ndisseminate such information upon request by members of \nthe public. Cf. Federal Election Comm’n v. Akins, 524 U. S.  \n11 (1998). \n  Havens was an unusual case, and this Court  has been \ncareful not to extend the Havens holding beyond its context.  \nSo too here.  \n  Finally, it has been suggested that the plaintiffs here \nmust have standing because if these plaintiffs do not have \nstanding, then it may be that no one would have standing \nto challenge FDA’s 2016 and 2021 actions.  For starters, it \n \n\n24  FDA v. ALLIANCE FOR HIPPOCRATIC MEDICINE  \n    \nOpinion of the Court \nis  not  clear  that  no  one  else  would  have  standing  to \nchallenge FDA’s relaxed regulation of mifepristone.  But \neven if no one would have standing, this Court has long \nrejected that kind of “if not us, who?” argument as a basis \nfor standing.  See Clapper, 568 U. S., at 420–421; Valley  \nForge, 454 U. S., at 489; Richardson, 418 U. S., at 179–180.   \nThe “assumption” that if these plaintiffs lack “standing to \nsue, no one would have standing, is not a reason to find  \nstanding.”  Schlesinger, 418 U. S., at 227.  Rather, some \nissues may be left to the political and democratic processes:  \nThe Framers of the Constitution did not “set up something \nin the nature of an Athenian democracy or a  New England \ntown  meeting  to  oversee  the  conduct  of  the  National \nGovernment  by  means  of  lawsuits  in  federal  courts.”   \nRichardson, 418 U. S., at 179; see Texas, 599 U. S., at 685. \n*  *  * \n  The plaintiffs have sincere legal, moral, ideological, and \npolicy objections to elective abortion and to FDA’s relaxed \nregulation of mifepristone.  But under Article III of the \nConstitution,  those  kinds  of  objections  alone  do  not \nestablish a justiciable case or controversy in federal court.  \nHere, the plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate that FDA’s \nrelaxed regulatory requirements  likely would cause them to \nsuffer an injury in fact.  For that reason, the federal courts \nare the wrong forum for addressing the plaintiffs’ concerns\nabout  FDA’s  actions.    The  plaintiffs  may  present  their \nconcerns and objections to the President and FDA in the \nregulatory process, or to Congress and the President in the \nlegislative process.  And they may also express their views  \nabout  abortion  and  mifepristone  to  fellow  citizens, \nincluding in the political and electoral processes.\n  “No  principle  is  more  fundamental  to  the  judiciary’s \nproper  role  in  our  system  of  government  than  the \nconstitutional  limitation  of  federal-court  jurisdiction  to \nactual cases or controversies.”  Simon, 426 U.

Our  \nprecedents require a plaintiff to demonstrate that the de-\nfendant’s challenged actions caused his asserted injuries.  \nAnd, the Court aptly explains why plaintiffs have failed to \nestablish that the Food and Drug Administration’s changes \nto the regulation of mifepristone injured them.  Ante, at 13– \n24. \n  The Court also rejects the plaintiff doctors’ theory that \nthey have third-party standing to assert the rights of their \npatients.  Ante, at 21, n.  5.  Our third-party standing prec-\nedents allow a plaintiff to assert the rights of another per-\nson when the plaintiff has a “close relationship with the \nperson who possesses the right” and “there is a hindrance \nto the possessor’s ability to protect his own interests.”  Kow-\n \n\n2  FDA v. ALLIANCE FOR HIPPOCRATIC MEDICINE  \n    \nTHOMAS,  J., concurring  \nalski v. Tesmer, 543 U. S. 125, 130 (2004) (internal quota-\ntion marks omitted).  Applying these precedents, the Court \nexplains  that  the  doctors  cannot  establish  third-party\nstanding to sue for violations of their patients’ rights with-\nout showing an injury of their own.  Ante, at 21, n. 5.  But,  \nthere is a far simpler reason to reject this theory: Our third-\nparty standing doctrine is mistaken.  As I have previously \nexplained, a plaintiff cannot establish an Article III case or \ncontroversy by asserting another person’s rights.1 See June \nMedical Services L. L. C. v. Russo, 591 U. S. 299, 366 (2020) \n(THOMAS, J.,  dissenting);  Kowalski,  543  U.  S.,  at  135 \n(THOMAS, J.,  concurring).    So,  just  as  abortionists  lack \nstanding to assert the rights of their clients, doctors who \noppose abortion cannot vicariously assert the rights of their \npatients.\n  I write separately to highlight what appear to be similar \nproblems with another theory of standing asserted in this\nsuit.  The Alliance and other plaintiff associations claim \nthat they have associational standing to sue for their mem-\nbers’ injuries.2   Under the Court’s precedents, “an associa-\ntion has standing to bring suit on behalf of its members \nwhen: (a) its members would otherwise have standing to \nsue in their own right; (b) the interests it seeks to protect \nare germane to the organization’s purpose; and (c) neither\nthe claim asserted nor the relief requested requires the par-\nticipation of individual members in the lawsuit.”  Hunt v.  \nWashington  State  Apple  Advertising  Comm’n,  432  U.

If an association can satisfy these require-\nments, we allow the association to pursue its members’ \nclaims, without joining those members as parties to the \nsuit. \n  Associational standing, however, is simply another form \nof  third-party  standing.    And,  the  Court  has  never  ex-\nplained or justified either doctrine’s expansion of Article III \nstanding.  In an appropriate case, we should explain just \nhow the Constitution permits associational standing. \nI \n  Associational standing raises constitutional concerns by \nrelaxing both the injury and redressability requirements \nfor Article III standing. It also upsets other legal doctrines. \n  First, associational standing conflicts with Article III by \npermitting an association to assert its members’ injuries in-\nstead of its own.  The “judicial power” conferred by Article \nIII “is limited to cases and controversies of the sort tradi-\ntionally amenable to, and resolved by, the judicial process.”  \nSee June Medical, 591 U. S., at 364 (opinion of THOMAS, J.)\n(internal quotation marks omitted).  “[T]o ascertain the \nscope  of  Article  III’s  case-or-controversy  requirement,” \ncourts therefore “refer directly to the traditional, funda-\nmental limitations upon the powers of common-law courts.”  \nIbid. (internal quotation marks omitted).  Traditionally, a\nplaintiff had to show a violation of his own rights to have \nhis claim considered by a common-law court.  See id., at \n364–366.  So, “private parties could not bring suit to vindi-\ncate the constitutional [or other legal] rights of individuals \nwho are not before the Court.”  Id., at 359.  “After all, ‘[t]he\nprovince of the court is, solely, to decide on the rights of in-\ndividuals,’” not to answer legal debates in the abstract.   \n \nAcheson  Hotels,  LLC  v.  Laufer,  601  U. S.  1,  10  (2023) \n(THOMAS,  J., concurring in judgment) (quoting Marbury v.  \nMadison, 1 Cranch 137, 170 (1803)); see also  ante, at 5–7.  \n  Associational standing seems to run roughshod over this  \n \n\n4  FDA v. ALLIANCE FOR HIPPOCRATIC MEDICINE  \n    \nTHOMAS,  J., concurring  \ntraditional understanding of the judicial power.  Our doc-\ntrine permits an association to have standing based purely \nupon a member’s injury, not its own.  If a single member of \nan association has suffered an injury, our doctrine permits \nthat association to seek relief for its entire membership—\neven if the association has tens of millions of other, non-\ninjured  members.  See  Brief  for  Professor  F.  Andrew \nHessick as Amicus Curiae 28 (explaining that, among other \nassociations, the American Association of Retired People’s \n“potential standing is staggering” because our doctrine per-\nmits it to “sue to redress” the injury of a single member out \nof its “almost thirty-eight million members”).  As I have al-\nready explained in the context of third-party standing, Ar-\nticle III does not allow a plaintiff to seek to vindicate some-\none else’s injuries.  See June Medical, 591 U. S., at 364–366  \n(opinion of THOMAS, J.); Kowalski, 543 U. S., at 135 (opin-\nion of THOMAS,  J.).  It is difficult to see why that logic \nshould not apply with equal force to an association as to any \nother plaintiff.  I thus have serious doubts that an associa-\ntion can have standing to vicariously assert a member’s in-\njury. \n  The Alliance’s attempted use of our associational-stand-\ning doctrine illustrates how far we have strayed from the \ntraditional rule that plaintiffs must assert only their own \ninjuries. The Alliance is an association whose members are  \nother associations.  See 1 App. 9–10.  None of its members  \nare doctors.  Instead, the Alliance seeks to have associa-\ntional standing based on injuries to the doctors who are \nmembers of its member associations.  Thus, the allegedly \ninjured  parties—the  doctors—are  two  degrees  removed \nfrom the party before us pursuing those injuries. \n  Second, our associational-standing doctrine does not ap-\npear to comport with the requirement that the plaintiff pre-\nsent an injury that the court can redress.  For a plaintiff to \nhave standing, a court must be able to “provid[e] a remedy \nthat can redress the plaintiff ’s injury.”  Uzuegbunam v.  \n \n \n\n  Cite as:  602 U. S. ____ (2024)  5 \n \nTHOMAS,  J., concurring  \nPreczewski, 592 U. S. 279, 291 (2021) (emphasis added).  \nBut, as explained, associational standing creates a mis-\nmatch: Although the association is the plaintiff in the suit, \nit has no injury to redress.  The party who needs the rem-\nedy—the injured member—is not before the court.  Without \nsuch members as parties to the suit, it is questionable \nwhether “relief to these nonparties . . . exceed[s] constitu-\ntional bounds.”  Association of American Physicians & Sur-\ngeons v. FDA, 13 F. 4th 531, 540 (CA6 2021); see also De-\npartment of Homeland Security v. New York, 589 U. S. ___,  \n___ (2020) (GORSUCH, J., concurring in grant of stay) (ex-\nplaining that remedies “are meant to redress the injuries\nsustained by a particular plaintiff in a particular lawsuit”); \nBrief for Professor F. Andrew Hessick as Amicus Curiae 18  \n(“A bedrock principle of the Anglo-American legal system\nwas that the right to a remedy for an injury was personal”). \n  Consider  the  remedial  problem  when  an  association \nseeks an injunction, as the Alliance did here.  See 1 App. \n113. “We have long held” that our equity jurisdiction is lim-\nited to “the jurisdiction in equity exercised by the High \nCourt of Chancery in England at the time of the adoption of \nthe Constitution.”  Grupo Mexicano de Desarrollo, S. A. v. \nAlliance Bond Fund, Inc., 527 U. S. 308, 318  (1999).  And,  \n“as a general rule, American courts of equity did not provide \nrelief beyond the parties to the case.” Trump v. Hawaii, 585 \nU. S. 667, 717 (2018) (THOMAS, J., concurring).  For associ-\nations, that principle would mean that the relief could not \nextend beyond the association. But, if a court entered “[a]n \ninjunction that bars a defendant from enforcing a law or \nregulation against the specific party before the court—the  \nassociational plaintiff—[it would] not satisfy Article III be-\ncause it w[ould] not redress an injury.”  Association of Amer-\n \n\n6  FDA v. ALLIANCE FOR HIPPOCRATIC MEDICINE  \n    \nTHOMAS,  J., concurring  \nican Physicians & Surgeons, 13 F. 4th, at 540 (internal quo-\ntation marks omitted).3  \n  Our precedents have provided a workaround for this ob-\nvious remedial problem through the invention of the so-\ncalled “universal injunction.”  Universal injunctions typi-\ncally “prohibit the Government from enforcing a policy with \nrespect  to  anyone.”  Trump,  585  U. S.,  at  713,  n. 1  \n(THOMAS, J., concurring).  By providing relief beyond the \nparties to the case, this remedy is “legally and historically \ndubious.”  Id., at 721; see also Labrador v. Poe, 601 U. S.  \n___, ___–___ (2024) (slip op., at 4–5) (GORSUCH,  J., concur-\nring in grant of stay). It seems no coincidence that associa-\ntional standing’s “emergence in the 1960s overlaps with the \nemergence of [this] remedial phenomenon” of a similarly \nquestionable nature. Association of American Physicians &  \nSurgeons, 13 F. 4th, at 541.  Because no party should be \npermitted to obtain an injunction in favor of nonparties, I\nhave difficulty seeing why an association should be permit-\nted to do so for its members.  Associational standing thus \nseems to distort our traditional understanding of the judi-\ncial power.\n  In addition to these Article III concerns, there is tension \nbetween  associational  standing  and  other  areas  of  law.  \nFirst, the availability of associational standing subverts the \nclass-action mechanism.  A class action allows a named \nplaintiff to represent others with similar injuries, but it is \nsubject to the many requirements of Federal Rule of Civil\nProcedure 23.  Associational standing achieves that same \n—————— \n3This also raises the question of who should pick the remedy.  Associ-\n \nations “may have very different interests from the individuals whose \nrights they are raising.”  Kowalski v. Tesmer, 543 U. S. 125, 135 (2004)  \n(THOMAS,  J.,  concurring).  For example, an association might prefer an  \ninjunction preventing the enforcement of a law that harms its members, \nwhile an injured member may instead want damages to compensate him \nfor his injuries.  Or perhaps a member would wish to settle the litigation, \nwhereas an association might want to continue the fight.  Our associa-\ntional-standing doctrine ignores these obvious concerns. \n \n\n  Cite as:  602 U. S. ____ (2024)  7 \n \nTHOMAS,  J., concurring  \nend goal: One lawsuit can provide relief to a large group of \npeople.  “As compared to a class action,” however, associa-\ntional standing seems to require “show[ing] an injury to \nonly a single member,” and the association “need not show \nthat litigation by representation is superior to individual \nlitigation.”  13A C. Wright, A. Miller, & E. Cooper, Federal\nPractice  and  Procedure  §3531.9.5,  pp.  879–880  (3d  ed., \nSupp. 2023); see also Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 23(a).  Associa-\ntional standing thus allows a party to effectively bring a \nclass action without satisfying any of the ordinary require-\nments. Second, associational standing creates the possibil-\nity of asymmetrical preclusion.  The basic idea behind pre-\nclusion is that a party gets only one bite at the apple.  If a \nparty litigates and loses an issue or claim, it can be barred \nfrom reasserting that same issue or claim in another suit.  \nIn general, preclusion prevents the relitigation of claims or \nissues only by a party to a previous action, and we have \nbeen careful to limit the exceptions to that rule.  See Taylor  \nv. Sturgell, 553 U. S. 880, 892–893 (2008).  In the context of \nassociational standing, the general rule would mean that \npreclusion applies only to the association, even though the \npurpose of the association’s suit is  to assert the injuries of \nits members.  See id., at 893–896.  But, if the association \nloses, it is not clear whether the adverse judgment would \nbind the members.  See Automobile Workers v. Brock, 477 \nU. S. 274, 290 (1986) (suggesting that, if an association fails \nto  adequately  represent  its  members,  “a  judgment  won \nagainst it might not preclude subsequent claims by the as-\nsociation’s members without offending due process princi-\nples”).  Associational standing might allow a member two \nbites at the apple—after an association’s claims are re-\njected, the underlying members might be able to assert the \nexact same issues or claims in a suit in their own names. \n  In short, our associational-standing doctrine appears to \ncreate serious problems, both constitutional and otherwise.  \n \n\n8  FDA v. ALLIANCE FOR HIPPOCRATIC MEDICINE  \n    \nTHOMAS,  J., concurring  \nII  \n  I am particularly doubtful of associational-standing doc-\ntrine because the Court has never attempted to  reconcile it \nwith the traditional understanding of the judicial power.  \nInstead, the Court departed from that traditional under-\nstanding without explanation, seemingly by accident.  To  \ndate, the Court has provided only practical reasons for its \ndoctrine. \n  For over a century and a half, the Court did not have a \nseparate standing doctrine for associations.  As far as I can  \ntell, the Court did not expressly contemplate such a doc-\ntrine until the late 1950s.  In NAACP v. Alabama ex rel.  \nPatterson, 357 U. S. 449 (1958), the Court permitted an as-\nsociation to assert the constitutional rights of its members \nto prevent the disclosure of its membership lists.  While the \nCourt allowed the NAACP to raise a challenge on behalf of\nits members, it also acknowledged that the NAACP had ar-\nguably faced an injury of its own.   Id., at 459–460.  The \nCourt, however, soon discarded any notion that an associa-\ntion needed to have its own injury, creating our modern as-\nsociational-standing doctrine.  In National Motor Freight \nTraffic Assn., Inc. v. United States, 372 U. S. 246 (1963) (per \ncuriam), the Court suggested that an uninjured industry \ngroup had standing to challenge a tariff schedule on behalf \nof its members.  Id., at 247.  The Court offered no explana-\ntion for how that theory of standing comported with the tra-\nditional understanding of the judicial power.  In fact, the \nCourt’s entire analysis consisted of a one-paragraph order \ndenying rehearing. Since then, however, the Court has par-\nroted that “[e]ven in the absence of injury to itself, an asso-\nciation may have standing solely as the representative of its \nmembers.”  Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.  S. 490, 511 (1975) (em-\nphasis added; citing National Motor Freight Traffic Assn., \n372 U. S. 246); see also, e.g., Automobile Workers, 477 U. S.,  \nat 281.  The Court has gone so far as to hold that a state  \n \n\n  Cite as:  602 U. S. ____ (2024)  9 \n \nTHOMAS,  J., concurring  \nagency—not a membership organization at all—had associ-\national standing to “asser[t] the claims of the Washington \napple  growers  and  dealers  who  form  its  constituency.”   \nHunt, 432 U. S., at 344. \n  Despite its continued reliance on associational standing, \nthe Court has yet to explain how the doctrine comports with \nArticle III.  When once asked to “reconsider and reject the \nprinciples of associational standing” in favor of the class-\naction mechanism, the Court justified the doctrine solely by \nreference to its “special features, advantageous both to the \nindividuals represented and to the judicial system as a  \nwhole.”  Automobile Workers, 477 U. S., at 288–289.  Those  \n“special features” included an association’s “pre-existing \nreservoir of expertise and capital,” and the fact that people \noften join an association “to create an effective vehicle for  \nvindicating interests that they share with others.”  Id., at  \n289–290.  But, considerations of practical judicial policy \ncannot overcome the Constitution’s mandates.  The lack of \nany  identifiable  justification  further  suggests  that  the \nCourt should reconsider its associational-standing doctrine.  \n*  *  * \n  No party challenges our associational-standing doctrine \ntoday.  That is understandable; the Court consistently ap-\nplies the doctrine, discussing only the finer points of its op-\neration.  See, e.g., Students for Fair Admissions, Inc. v. \nPresident and Fellows of Harvard College, 600 U. S. 181,  \n199–201 (2023).  In this suit, rejecting our associational-\nstanding doctrine is not necessary to conclude that the \nplaintiffs lack standing.  In an appropriate case, however, \nthe Court should address whether associational standing\ncan be squared with Article III’s requirement that courts  \nrespect the bounds of their judicial power. \n ",
