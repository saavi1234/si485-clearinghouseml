    "summary": "<p>This is a case about whether the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution requires public access to audio recordings of bail hearings before the Philadelphia Municipal Court. &nbsp;In Philadelphia, defendants who are arrested and then charged with a crime remain held in a divisional booking center, where they participate via videoconference in bail hearings. &nbsp;Philadelphia Municipal Arraignment Court Magistrates (ACMs) conduct these hearings and determine whether to release a defendant and what conditions, if any, to impose on release. &nbsp;Although the preliminary arraignments are open to the public and recorded for &ldquo;internal review purposes,&rdquo; neither these recordings nor transcripts of the hearings are made available for public access. &nbsp;Members of the public are generally barred from making their own recordings of bail proceedings pursuant to three court rules: P.A. Rule of Criminal Procedure 112(C), P.A. Rule of Judicial Administration 1910 and Local Arraignment Court Magistrate Rule 7.09. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On July 17, 2019, &nbsp;the Philadelphia Community Bail Fund and an independent journalist sued six ACMs of the Philadelphia Municipal Court, as well as the President Judge and the sheriff in their official capacities, in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. &nbsp;Represented by lawyers from the Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection of Georgetown University and a private law firm, the plaintiffs sued under 42 U.S.C. 1983 and sought a declaratory judgment that these court rules, in so far as they prevented the public from making audio recordings of bail proceedings, violated their First Amendment public access rights to court proceedings. &nbsp;They also requested attorney&rsquo;s fees. &nbsp;The case was assigned to Senior Judge Harvey Bartle III. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On September 4, 2019, the defendants moved to dismiss, arguing that the First Amendment right of access to attend judicial proceedings does not extend to a right to record such hearings. Instead, defendants contended that permission to record is a policy choice for each judicial system. &nbsp;After hearing oral argument, Judge Bartle denied the motion to dismiss on November 13, 2019. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs and the defendants both proceeded to file motions for summary judgment on December 20, 2019. &nbsp;Judge Bartle found for the plaintiffs on February 25, 2020, 440 F.Supp.3d 415, holding that the defendants had failed to present an overriding governmental interest to justify their denial of access to the public. &nbsp;Judge Bartle determined that the right to be physically present and take notes at bail hearings was inadequate to satisfy the First Amendment right to public access. &nbsp;Accordingly, he found that the three court rules were unconstitutional, insofar as they prevented the public from recording bail hearings in a non-disruptive and quiet manner, because of the absence of available alternatives, such as official audio recordings or transcripts of the bail hearings. &nbsp;If the municipal court were to make these alternative records of proceedings available, however, Judge Bartle noted that the First Amendment would not require a right to make one&rsquo;s own recordings. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The defendants appealed to the U.S. Third Circuit Court of Appeals on March 24, 2020. &nbsp;A panel for the Third Circuit initially reversed the district court&rsquo;s decision to grant summary judgment on September 29, 2020. &nbsp;976 F.3d 302. &nbsp;The Court agreed that the First Amendment right of access to the courtroom includes physical attendance and meaningful access to documents produced during proceedings. &nbsp;The panel &ndash; composed of Senior Circuit Judge Morton I. Greenberg, Circuit Judge Peter J. Phipps and Circuit Judge Cheryl Ann Krause &ndash; found, however, that the right of access does not include &ldquo;an affirmative requirement that the judiciary create or allow the creation of verbatim records of its proceedings&rdquo; under First Amendment precedent. &nbsp;Therefore, the Court determined that that the district court erred by broadening the right to access beyond the ability to obtain a &ldquo;comprehensive record&rdquo; of proceedings. &nbsp;According to the majority, the fact that the public &ldquo;may not be able to capture every word spoken does not meaningfully interfere with the public's ability to inform itself of the proceeding&rdquo; because other methods were available, such as obtaining the criminal complaint and accessing online dockets. &nbsp;Judge Krause authored a lengthy dissent in which she contended that allowing courts to prohibit audio recordings stands to &ldquo;eviscerate&rdquo; the right of access and that the majority&rsquo;s reasoning unjustly applied to all judicial proceedings, not just bail hearings. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs submitted a petition to rehear the case en banc on November 12, 2020, arguing that the panel&rsquo;s decision directly conflicted with the Court&rsquo;s precedents, including Whiteland Woods v. Township of West Whiteland, 193 F.3d 177 (3d Cir. 1999), which held that the government cannot prevent the public from obtaining a comprehensive record of an open proceeding. &nbsp;Several interested organizations filed amicus briefs supporting the plaintiffs&rsquo; petition, including the ACLU of Pennsylvania, Pennsylvanians for Modern Courts, the CATO Institute, the R Street Institute, Professor Eugene Volokh and the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, which was joined by nineteen media organizations.&nbsp; In addition, the Philadelphia District Attorney's Office and&nbsp;the Philadelphia Defender Association both <a href=\"https://www.law.com/thelegalintelligencer/2020/10/01/what-are-they-trying-to-hide-debate-over-phila-court-transparency-stoked-by-new-ruling/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">expressed their support for allowing records of bail proceedings</a>.&nbsp; On January 11, 2021, the Third Circuit granted the plaintiffs&rsquo; petition, and voted to vacate the panel opinion and rehear the case en banc. &nbsp;984 F.3d 273. &nbsp;Shortly thereafter, however, the bail magistrates voluntarily dismissed their appeal, a decision which may have been influenced by pressure from interested parties. &nbsp;The Third Circuit proceeded to reaffirm that the earlier panel opinion was vacated and dismissed the case. &nbsp;2021 WL 1897359. &nbsp;Therefore, the district court&rsquo;s holding remains in force: absent official court records, such as recordings or transcripts, the First Amendment right of access requires a court to allow the public to record bail hearings. &nbsp;The case is now closed. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

A nonprofit and independent journalist brought this lawsuit under 42 U.S.C. 1983 in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania against six Philadelphia bail magistrates for prohibiting the public from recording  bail hearings, when the court failed to provide official recordings or transcripts of the proceedings.  They sought a declaratory judgment that the three court rules giving rise to the policy were unconstitutional, insofar as they resulted in the prohibition.  Senior Judge Harvey Bartle III granted summary judgment in favor of the plaintiffs, finding that the prohibition violated the First Amendment right of public access to court proceedings.  On appeal, a panel for the U.S. Court of appeals for the Third Circuit reversed and held that the First Amendment does not require that the judiciary make available or allow recordings of its proceedings.  The Third Circuit subsequently voted to rehear the case en banc and vacate the panel's opinion.  Shortly thereafter, however, the bail magistrates voluntarily dismissed their appeal.  As a result, the holding of the district court remains in force: absent official records, the right to access requires a court to allow the public to record bail hearings",

February 25, 2020 \n \n    This case involves the First Amendment right of public \naccess to bail hearings in the Philadelphia Municipal Court. \nPlaintiff Philadelphia Bail Fund, a non-profit \norganization advocating for reform of Philadelphiaโs bail \nsystem, brings this action under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 against \nPhiladelphia Municipal Court Arraignment Court Magistrates \nFrancis Bernard, Sheila Bedford, Kevin Devlin, James OโBrien, \nCateria McCabe, and Robert Stack as well as against Philadelphia \nMunicipal Court President Judge Patrick Dugan and the Sheriff of \nPhiladelphia County, Rochelle Bilal.1  All are being sued in \ntheir official capacities.  Plaintiff seeks a declaratory \njudgment that two Pennsylvania court rules and a Philadelphia \nMunicipal Court Arraignment Court Magistrate rule, insofar as \n \n1.  Originally Merry Reed, a writer and reporter, was named as \na plaintiff.  She has been dismissed from the action by \nagreement of the parties.  By stipulation, the parties have also \nsubstituted a new Arraignment Court Magistrate and the \nnewly-elected Sheriff of Philadelphia County as defendants. \n \n\nCase 2:19-cv-03110-HB   Document 51   Filed 02/25/20   Page 2 of 26\nthey prohibit plaintiff from making audio recordings of bail \nhearings, violate its right of access to court proceedings under \nthe First Amendment to the United States Constitution.  The \ncomplaint also requests attorneyโs fees and costs against the \nSheriff and โsuch further relief as may be just, lawful and \nequitable.โ2  The plaintiff does not seek damages from any of the \ndefendants. \nBefore the court are cross motions of the parties for \nsummary judgment under Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure. \nI \n    Under Rule 56(a), summary judgment may be granted โif \nthe movant shows that there is no genuine dispute of material \nfact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.โ  \nHere, the parties have stipulated to all the relevant facts.  We \nmust simply decide whether any of the parties is entitled to \njudgment as a matter of law. \nII \nThe following are the relevant facts to which the \nparties have stipulated. \n \n2.  The Sheriff also filed a cross-claim against the judicial \ndefendants for indemnity for any assessed attorneyโs fees and \ncosts. \n-2- \n \n\nCase 2:19-cv-03110-HB   Document 51   Filed 02/25/20   Page 3 of 26\nThe six defendant Arraignment Court Magistrates3 are \nappointed by the Philadelphia Municipal Court for four-year \nterms to conduct bail hearings at preliminary arraignments, \namong other duties.  42 Pa.C.S. ยง 1123(a)(5).  They do not have \nto be lawyers.  See 42 Pa.C.S. ยง 3112.  They sit on a rotating \nbasis in a courtroom in the basement of the Criminal Justice \nCenter in downtown Philadelphia and conduct each bail hearing \nover a video link to each of the seven Philadelphia Divisional \nBooking Centers where arrestees are processed.  A magistrate is \navailable twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, and \n365 days a year.  On average there are 30,000 bail hearings a \nyear or roughly 90 hearings per day in Philadelphia. \nWhen an individual is arrested, he or she is taken to \none of the seven Divisional Booking Centers to be processed.  A \npolice report is generated and is electronically transmitted to \nthe Philadelphia District Attorneyโs Office for charging.  The \nreport is also transmitted to the Pretrial Services Division of \nthe First Judicial District, which encompasses Philadelphia \nCounty, to aid it in conducting an interview of the arrestee.  \nThe Pretrial Services Division asks the arrestee about his or \nher residence, employment, health, education, financial \nsituation, and other biographical details which it compiles into \n \n3.  The magistrates are sometimes referred to as Bail \nCommissioners.  42 Pa.C.S. ยง 3111.  \n-3- \n \n\nCase 2:19-cv-03110-HB   Document 51   Filed 02/25/20   Page 4 of 26\na report.  It then submits the report to the magistrate through \nthe Preliminary Arraignment Reporting System (โPARSโ).  After \nreceipt of this report and approval of the charges against the \narrestee by the District Attorneyโs Office, the magistrate holds \na preliminary arraignment where bail is determined.  The \nPretrial Services Division report is available to the court, the \nDistrict Attorneyโs office, and the arresteeโs representative \nbut not to the public. \nThe preliminary arraignment takes place on average \nfifteen hours after the arrest.  The name of the arrestee and \nthe case and its number is first made public at that time.  The \nprosecution, the defense counsel, and the arrestee all have an \nopportunity to address and argue before the magistrate \nconcerning bail and answer any questions the magistrate may \npose.  Typically, neither the assistant district attorney nor \nthe attorney for the arrestee submits any written argument.  At \nthe conclusion of the hearing, the magistrate decides whether \npretrial release is appropriate and if so the amount and \nconditions of bail.  Rules 523 and 524 of the Pennsylvania Rules \nof Criminal Procedure respectively set forth the criteria for \nrelease on bail and the types of release.  Each bail hearing \ntypically lasts less than four minutes on average.  If either \nparty objects to the magistrateโs decision, a Municipal Court \njudge is immediately available by telephone for a de novo \n-4- \n \n\nCase 2:19-cv-03110-HB   Document 51   Filed 02/25/20   Page 5 of 26\nappeal.  The audio-visual connection with the arrestee, however, \nis terminated before any appeal.4 \nAll preliminary arraignments are open to the public \nand press.  The courtroom has capacity for an audience of 65 and \ncontains a glass wall which separates the spectators from the \nfront of the courtroom.  The proceedings are amplified by a \nspeaker system, and the audience can observe the visual link \nshowing the arrestee.  While the public and press may observe \nand take notes, the court rules in issue prohibit them from \nmaking video or audio recordings.  The Sheriffโs Office \nmaintains order in the courtroom and enforces the court rules at \nthe direction of the presiding magistrate. \nThere is no transcript of the preliminary arraignment \nor of any immediate telephonic appeal to a Municipal Court \njudge, and no court reporter is present for either.  Although \nthe court makes audio recordings of these preliminary \narraignments, it does so to address technical issues such as the \nquality of the sound and to enable the President Judge of the \nMunicipal Court to monitor the performance of the magistrates.  \nThe recordings are not filed of record and are not used in \n \n4.  An arrestee may also obtain a further hearing in the \nMunicipal Court by filing a motion to challenge a bail \ndetermination or to have the bail amount reduced or to ask to \nparticipate in what is known as โEarly Bail Review.โ  This \nfurther hearing will take place within five days of the initial \nbail hearing at the earliest. \n-5- \n \n\nCase 2:19-cv-03110-HB   Document 51   Filed 02/25/20   Page 6 of 26\nmaking a bail determination in any case or in any subsequent \nhearing or for any appeal.  The recordings are not available to \nthe parties or the public and are of inferior quality and often \nhard to hear.5  Such recordings are not made under the First \nJudicial District Digital Recording Program from which official \ncourt transcripts of other proceedings are prepared. \nCounsel for the judicial defendants advised the court \nat oral argument and plaintiffโs counsel does not dispute that \nthe public may obtain for a fee written transcripts of all \njudicial proceedings that are the subject of the First Judicial \nDistrict Digital Recording Program.  Copies of the underlying \nrecordings themselves, however, are not publicly available. \nFollowing the preliminary arraignment, various court \ndocuments related to it are filed of record.  These documents \ninclude the criminal complaint and a form which contains the \nmagistrateโs decision concerning bail.  Copies are available at \ntwenty-five cents per page, but there is no charge simply to \nview the documents.  Docket sheets are also publicly accessible.  \nIn addition, the Administrative Office of Pennsylvania Courts \nmakes available a bulk data report of case information for every \npreliminary arraignment in the Municipal Court.  The public may \n \n5.  Counsel for the judicial defendants, in response to a \nquestion from the court, stated the facts in the second half of \nthis sentence.

Shortly after, \nthe Philadelphia Bail Fund instituted this action. \nIII \nThe court rules at issue in this case generally \noperate to prohibit audio and video recordings of criminal \nproceedings by members of the public. \nRule 112 of the Pennsylvania Rules of Criminal \nProcedure provides6: \n(C)  Except as provided in paragraph (D), \nthe stenographic, mechanical, electronic \nrecording, or the recording using any \nadvanced communication technology, of any \njudicial proceedings by anyone other than \nthe official court stenographer in a court \ncase, for any purpose, is prohibited. \n \n(D)  In a judicial proceeding before an \nissuing authority, the issuing authority, \nthe attorney for the Commonwealth, the \naffiant, or the defendant may cause a \nrecording to be made of the judicial \nproceeding as an aid to the preparation of \nthe written record for subsequent use in a \n \n6.  The Pennsylvania Rules of Criminal Procedure are adopted by \nthe Supreme Court of Pennsylvania under the authority of the \nConstitution of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.  See \nPa. Const. art. V, ยง 10(c); Pa.R.Crim.P. 102. \n \n-7- \n \n\nCase 2:19-cv-03110-HB   Document 51   Filed 02/25/20   Page 8 of 26\ncase, but such recordings shall not be \npublicly played or disseminated in any \nmanner unless in a court during a trial or \nhearing. \n \nRule 1910 of the Pennsylvania Rules of Judicial \nAdministration provides in relevant part:  โjudges shall \nprohibit broadcasting, televising, recording or taking \nphotographs in the courtroom and areas immediately adjacent \nthereto during sessions of court or recesses between sessions,โ \nsubject to limited exceptions not relevant here.โ Pa.R.J.A. \nNo. 1910(B).7 \nThe Philadelphia Municipal Court Arraignment Court \nMagistrate rule 7.09 reads in relevant part:  โ[a]n Arraignment \nCourt Magistrate shall prohibit broadcasting, televising, \nrecording, or taking photographs in the Courtroom or the areas \nimmediately adjacent thereto during sessions or recesses between \nsessions. . . .โ  Phila. M.C.R. Crim., A.C.M., Sec. 7.09. \nIV \n    The plaintiff has brought this action under 42 U.S.C. \nยง 1983 which provides: \nEvery person who, under color of any \nstatute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or \nusage, of any State . . . subjects, or \n \n7.  The Pennsylvania Supreme Court recently ordered Rule \n1910(B) amended to read โjudges shall prohibitโ rather than \nโjudges should prohibitโ the recording of judicial proceedings.  \nSee In re Amendment of Rule 1910 of Judicial Admin., No. 522 \n(Pa. Oct. 8, 2019).  The amendment took effect on January 1, \n2020.  Id. \n-8- \n \n\nCase 2:19-cv-03110-HB   Document 51   Filed 02/25/20   Page 9 of 26\ncauses to be subjected any citizen of the \nUnited States or other person within the \njurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of \nany rights, privileges, or immunities \nsecured by the Constitution and laws, shall \nbe liable to the party injured in an action \nat law, suit in equity, or other proper \nproceeding for redress, except that in any \naction brought against a judicial officer \nfor an act or omission taken in such \nofficerโs judicial capacity, injunctive \nrelief shall not be granted unless a \ndeclaratory decree was violated or \ndeclaratory relief was unavailable. . . . \n \nThe question before the court is whether the plaintiff \nis entitled under the First Amendment to audio-record bail \nhearings in the Philadelphia Municipal Court where the court \nitself only makes inferior recordings for internal purposes and \ndoes not make official recordings or transcripts of those \nproceedings.  Under Rule 115 of the Pennsylvania Rules of \nCriminal Procedure, recordings of proceedings in open court are \nnot mandated until โafter a defendant has been held for court,โ \nthat is, until after a preliminary arraignment in the Municipal \nCourt.  Pa.R.Crim.P. 115(A); see also Pa.R.Crim.P. 1012(A). \nThe First Amendment reads in relevant part:  โCongress \nshall make no law . . . abridging the freedom of speech, or of \nthe press . . .โ  This guarantee has been incorporated into the \ndue process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and applies to \nthe states.  Natโl Inst. of Family and Life Advocates v. \nBecerra, 138 S. Ct. 2361, 2371 (2018).  It is now well-settled \n-9- \n \n\nCase 2:19-cv-03110-HB   Document 51   Filed 02/25/20   Page 10 of 26\nthat the First Amendment guarantees the right of public access \nto criminal trials, including the right to listen and take notes \nand to disseminate and publish what is observed.  Richmond \nNewspapers, Inc. v. Virginia, 448 U.S. 555, 575-80 (1980).  \nUnderlying this right of access is โthe common understanding \nthat a major purpose of the [First] Amendment was to protect the \nfree discussion of governmental affairsโ and โto ensure that \nthis constitutionally protected โdiscussion of government \naffairsโ is an informed one.โ  Globe Newspapers Co. v. Superior \nCourt for Norfolk Cnty., 457 U.S. 596, 604-05 (1982).  Public \nscrutiny also โfosters an appearance of fairnessโ and โpermits \nthe public to participate in and serve as a check upon the \njudicial process.โ  Id. at 606. \nThe right of public access, like many aspects of the \nFirst Amendment, is not absolute.  Id. at 606.  However, any \ndenial of access must be narrowly tailored and be necessitated \nby a compelling governmental interest.  Id. at 607.  It must \nalso be determined on a case-by-case basis.  Id. at 608.  As the \nSupreme Court later stated in Press-Enterprise Co. v. Superior \nCourt of Cal., 478 U.S. 1, 9-10 (1986): \nThe presumption may be overcome only by an \noverriding interest based on findings that \nclosure is essential to preserve higher \nvalues and is narrowly tailored to serve \nthat interest.  The interest is to be \narticulated along with findings specific \nenough that a reviewing court can determine \n-10- \n \n\nCase 2:19-cv-03110-HB   Document 51   Filed 02/25/20   Page 11 of 26\nwhether the closure order was properly \nentered. \n \nIn stressing the importance of public access, the Supreme Court \nhad declared that the blanket closure of courtrooms even for the \ntestimony of minor victims of sexual offenses violates the First \nAmendment.  Globe Newspapers Co., 457 U.S. at 602-11.   \n    In United States v. Simone, 14 F.3d 833, 839 (3d Cir. \n1994), our Court of Appeals delineated six societal interests in \nsupport of open courtrooms: \n[P]romotion of informed discussion of \ngovernmental affairs by providing the public \nwith the more complete understanding of the \njudicial system; promotion of the public \nperception of fairness which can be achieved \nonly by permitting full public view of the \nproceedings; providing a significant \ncommunity therapeutic value as an outlet for \ncommunity concern, hostility and emotion; \nserving as a check on corrupt practices by \nexposing the judicial process to public \nscrutiny; enhancement of the performance of \nall involved; and discouragement of perjury. \n \nThe Supreme Court has extended that First Amendment \nright of public access beyond the criminal trial itself.  It has \nheld that the First Amendment also applies to jury selection and \nto preliminary hearings.  Press-Enterprise Co. v. Superior Court \nof Cal., 464 U.S. 501, 513 (1984); Press-Enterprise Co., 478 \nU.S. at 13.  Our Court of Appeals has also concluded that \npost-trial hearings to investigate jury misconduct must also be \n-11- \n \n\nCase 2:19-cv-03110-HB   Document 51   Filed 02/25/20   Page 12 of 26\nopen to the public under the First Amendment.  Simone, 14 F.3d \nat 840. \nWhile the parties have not cited any case specifically \ndealing with bail hearings, we have no hesitancy in determining \nthat the right of public access encompasses this significant \naspect of the judicial process.  The Eighth Amendment to the \nConstitution specifically guarantees that โExcessive bail shall \nnot be required.โ  See Timbs v. Indiana, 139 S. Ct. 682, 688 \n(2019). Regardless of what the historical practice of openness \nmay have been, the societal interests outlined by the Supreme \nCourt and later by our Court of Appeals in Simone all lead to \nthe inexorable conclusion that the First Amendment protects the \nright to attend and report on bail proceedings. \nIn addition to the constitutional right to attend \ncriminal judicial proceedings, the courts have dealt with public \naccess to judicial records.  There is a common law right of the \npublic โto inspect and copy . . . judicial records and \ndocumentsโ in criminal as well as civil cases.  In re Avandia \nMktg., Sales Practices and Prods. Liab. Litig., 924 F.3d 662, \n672 (3d Cir. 2019).  This right long antedates the Constitution \nand, at least in the criminal context, has now taken on \nconstitutional dimensions.  In Press-Enterprise Co., for \nexample, the Supreme Court elevated to First Amendment status \n-12- \n \n\nCase 2:19-cv-03110-HB   Document 51   Filed 02/25/20   Page 13 of 26\nthe right of the public to have access to a copy of the \ntranscript of a preliminary hearing.  478 U.S. at 13. \nIn United States v. Antar, 38 F.3d 1348 (3d Cir. \n1994), our Court of Appeals concluded that the district court \nerred in initially sealing the transcript of jury voir dire and \nputting restrictions on its use when later unsealed, including \nlimiting use of juror information.  The Court of Appeals made \nclear that access to the transcripts of a judicial proceeding is \nas critical under the First Amendment as is the right to be \npresent to hear and observe what occurs in the courtroom.  The \nCourt emphasized: \nTrue public access to a proceeding means \naccess to knowledge of what occurred there.  \nIt is served not only by witnessing a \nproceeding firsthand, but also by learning \nabout it through a secondary source. . . .  \nAccess to the documentation of an open \nproceeding, then, facilitates the openness \nof the proceeding itself by assuring the \nbroadest dissemination.  It would be an odd \nresult indeed were we to declare that our \ncourtrooms must be open, but that \ntranscripts of the proceedings occurring \nthere may be closed, for what exists of the \nright of access if it extends only to those \nwho can squeeze through the door? \n \nId. at 1360. \n \nThe Court grounded its analysis on the First \nAmendment:  โThis strong presumption of access to records, \nincluding transcripts, provides independent support for the \n-13- \n \n\nCase 2:19-cv-03110-HB   Document 51   Filed 02/25/20   Page 14 of 26\nconclusion that the First Amendment right of access must extend \nequally to transcripts as to live proceedings.โ  Id. at 1361. \nThe right to attend and report on trials and to have \naccess to judicial records, albeit not absolute, has now been \nfirmly established as a First Amendment right.  The Supreme \nCourt has also held in Chandler v. Florida, 449 U.S. 560, 583 \n(1981), that the Constitution does not prohibit radio, \ntelevision or photographic coverage of a criminal trial.  While \nthe press is not constitutionally prohibited from recording and \nbroadcasting a criminal trial, it is also not constitutionally \nentitled to do so.  The Court wrote in Nixon v. Warner Commcโns, \nInc., 435 U.S. 589, 610 (1978) that the press has โno \nconstitutional right to have such testimony [of live witnesses] \nrecorded and broadcast.โ  Likewise, a number of appellate \ndecisions in other circuits have denied any First Amendment \nright to audio-record, videotape or televise court proceedings.  \nSee, e.g., Conway v. United States, 852 F.2d 187, 188 (6th Cir. \n1988); United States v. Yonkers Bd. of Educ., 747 F.2d 111, 113-\n14 (2d Cir. 1984); United States v. Hastings, 695 F.2d 1278, \n1284 (11th Cir. 1983). \nThe plaintiffs rely on a more recent decision, \nWhiteland Woods, LP v. Twp. of West Whiteland, 193 F.3d 177 \n(3d Cir. 1999), a case which did not involve public access to \ncriminal proceedings.  There the plaintiff claimed a \n-14- \n \n\nCase 2:19-cv-03110-HB   Document 51   Filed 02/25/20   Page 15 of 26\nFirst Amendment right to videotape a meeting of a Township \nPlanning Commission.  The Court of Appeals framed the issue \nbefore it as follows: \nThe primary issue on appeal is whether there \nis a federal constitutional right to \nvideotape public meetings of a township \nplanning commission when other effective \nmeans of recording the proceedings are \navailable. \n \nId. at 180. \n \nThe Court held that under the circumstances no \nFirst Amendment right to videotape existed.  Id. at 185.  It \nnoted that interested parties and the public were allowed to \ntake notes, use audio recording devices, and even engage \nstenographers.  The Court observed: \nNothing in the record suggests videotaping \nwould have provided a uniquely valuable \nsource of information about Planning \nCommission meetings.  The First Amendment \ndoes not require states to accommodate every \npotential method of recording its \nproceedings, particularly where the public \nis granted alternative means of compiling a \ncomprehensive record. \n \nId. at 183. \nIn affirming the district courtโs order granting \nsummary judgment in favor of the Township, the Court concluded, \nโ. . . plaintiff has failed to demonstrate an essential nexus \nbetween the right of access and a right to videotape the \nPlanning Commission proceedings.  Id. at 183-84. \n-15- \n \n\nCase 2:19-cv-03110-HB   Document 51   Filed 02/25/20   Page 16 of 26\nThe most recent pronouncement of our Court of Appeals \non the First Amendment right to record a public event is in \nFields v. City of Phila., 862 F.3d 353 (3d Cir. 2017).  This \ncase like Whiteland Woods did not involve access to a court \nproceeding.  See id. at 355.  There plaintiffs brought an action \nagainst the City of Philadelphia and certain police officers for \nretaliation for photographing and recording police activity in \narresting protestors in public places.  Id.  The Court held that \nplaintiffs had a First Amendment right to do so.  Id. at 360.  \nIt observed, โTo record what there is the right for the eye to \nsee or the ear to hear corroborates or lays aside subjective \nimpression for objective facts.โ  Id. at 359.  The Court \ncontinued, โWe do not say that all recording is protected or \ndesirable.  It is subject to reasonable time, place, and manner \nrestrictions. . . .  But in public places these restrictions are \nrestrained.โ  Id. at 360. \nThe cases that have considered the issue have all held \nthat the First Amendment does not guarantee the public the right \nto record judicial proceedings. These holdings, in our view, do \nnot end the analysis because the facts here are significantly \ndifferent.  In none of those cases does it appear that the court \nof first instance had a policy or custom not to make official \nrecordings or transcripts of those proceedings.  Indeed, in \nseveral of those cases, the decision specifically referenced the \n-16- \n \n\nCase 2:19-cv-03110-HB   Document 51   Filed 02/25/20   Page 17 of 26\nfact that either a transcript was available or the court had an \nofficial recording system. \nIn Nixon, the press sought copies of the actual Nixon \ntapes featured in a criminal trial of the ex-Presidentโs former \nadvisors with the intent of broadcasting them.  435 U.S. at \n591-92.  While denying the request because of the special \nprovisions of the Presidential Recordings Act and stating that \nthe press had no constitutional right to record and broadcast \nanything, the Court emphasized that the press already had copies \nof the trial transcripts which included the tapes that were \nbeing sought.  Id. at 610. \nIn Yonkers Bd. of Educ., the Court of Appeals for the \nSecond Circuit upheld a federal district court rule banning the \npublic use of recording devices in the courtroom.  747 F.2d at \n113-14.  Yet, in doing so, it touched upon the existence of an \nofficial reporting system as one of the reasons not to allow the \npublic to make recordings.  Id. at 114.  The Second Circuit \nopined that โindiscriminate recording of trial proceedings might \nundermine the official court reporter system.โ  Id.  Of course, \nin this pending case there are no transcripts and no official \ncourt reporter system to undermine. \nThe precedents in this circuit have emphasized how \nimportant the objective record of an event can be beyond what \none may see or hear whether in a court proceeding or elsewhere.  \n-17- \n \n\nCase 2:19-cv-03110-HB   Document 51   Filed 02/25/20   Page 18 of 26\nAs our Court of Appeals stated in Antar, โAccess to the \ndocumentation of an open proceeding . . . facilitates the \nopenness of the proceeding itself by assuring the broadest \ndissemination.  It would be an odd result indeed were we to \ndeclare that our courtrooms must be opened, but that transcripts \nof the proceedings occurring there may be closed. . . .โ  \n38 F.3d at 1360.   \nIn Whiteland Woods, the Court of Appeals denied the \nright to videotape a Township Planning Commission meeting.  \n193 F.3d at 183-84.  In doing so, it explained that โThe First \nAmendment does not require states to accommodate every potential \nmethod of recording its proceedings, particularly where the \npublic is granted alternative means of compiling a comprehensive \nrecord.โ  Id. (emphasis added).  And recently in Fields, \ninvolving the recording of public police activity, the Court \nasserted, โTo record what there is the right for the eye to see \nor the ear to hear corroborates or lays aside subjective \nimpression for objective facts.โ  862 F.3d at 359.  These three \ncases all emphasized the significance of a recording of events \nas well as the significance of court records in any First \nAmendment analysis. \nWe recognize that First Amendment decisions which \ninvolved other kinds of public spaces are not necessarily \napplicable to judicial proceedings.  Courtrooms, whether they \n-18- \n \n\nCase 2:19-cv-03110-HB   Document 51   Filed 02/25/20   Page 19 of 26\nare deemed public or non-public fora, are different than other \nplaces such as street corners, parks, subways, stadiums, \ntheaters, and even the halls of non-judicial governmental \nbodies.  Courts are fact-finding institutions which after due \ndeliberation adjudicate constitutional and other significant \nsubstantive and procedural rights of litigants.  Fairness and \nimpartiality are paramount.  There must be decorum, dignity, \norder and even solemnity in the judicial process.  The hustle \nand bustle and cacophony of the street or marketplace have no \nplace in the courtroom.  The behavior and actions of \nparticipants and spectators attending a judicial proceeding are \nproperly subject to unique constraints that do not apply \nelsewhere. \nThere also can be no denying that bail hearings are a \nsignificant part of the criminal process.  Indeed, as already \nnoted, there is a constitutional dimension to them.  The Eighth \nAmendment provides that โ[e]xcessive bail shall not be \nrequired. . . .โ  Likewise, the Constitution of the Commonwealth \ndeclares that โ[e]xcessive bail shall not be required. . . .โ  \nPa. Const. art. I, ยง 13.8  What and how the defendant magistrates \n \n8.  Article I ยง 14 of the Pennsylvania Constitution further \nprovides: \n \nAll prisoners shall be bailable by \nsufficient sureties, unless for capital \noffenses or for offenses for which the \n-19- \n \n\nCase 2:19-cv-03110-HB   Document 51   Filed 02/25/20   Page 20 of 26\nrule on bail is no small matter even though a bail hearing \nusually lasts less than four minutes on average.  Bail of course \nmay be denied to protect the public or the arrestee and to \nprevent pretrial flight.  At other times, release will be \ngranted and in those cases the magistrate will be required to \ndecide appropriate monetary and non-monetary conditions of \nrelease pursuant to the detailed state procedural rules.  \nSee Pa.R.Crim.P. 523-28. \nThe decisions of the magistrates will affect, in many \ninstances, whether the arrestees can continue to work and \nsupport their families pending trial.  The time period between \nthe bail hearing and the trial is often many months if not \nlonger.  Improperly setting bail beyond the financial reach of \nan impecunious individual or otherwise erring in a decision can \nresult in wrongful pretrial detention, with particularly \nunfortunate consequences if the charges are later dropped or an \narrestee is found not guilty.  We, of course, do not intimate \nthat the magistrates here are making improper rulings, either \nunder Pennsylvania law or the United States Constitution.  The \nsalient point is that meaningful public access to bail hearings \n \nmaximum sentence is life imprisonment or \nunless no condition or combination of \nconditions other than imprisonment will \nreasonably assure the safety of any person \nand the community when the proof is evident \nor presumption great . . . . \n-20- \n \n\nCase 2:19-cv-03110-HB   Document 51   Filed 02/25/20   Page 21 of 26\nis imperative.  The rulings concerning bail and the process by \nwhich they are made, no matter how quickly accomplished, have \nfederal and state constitutional ramifications.  The rulings and \nthe process have serious consequences for the arrestee and \nimplicate vital societal interests.  See Simone, 14 F.3d at 839. \nThe defendants justify the ban on audio recordings as \nneeded to protect the privacy of the arrestee and his or her \nright to a fair trial.  The ban, according to the defendants, \nallows arrestees to speak more frankly at the bail hearing \nconcerning their mental health, drug issues and other personal \nmatters.  We find this argument unconvincing.  The bail hearings \nare presently open to the press and public, and anyone can \nobserve and take notes about what is occurring.  Thus, anything \nsaid at the hearing is subject to wider dissemination and can \nappear in the newspapers, on television, or on social media even \nif no audio recordings by the public are allowed.  Further, \ndefendants have not articulated why the privacy of the arrestee \nat bail hearings is any more compelling than the privacy of an \narrestee at later stages of the criminal process when judicial \nrecordings are made and transcripts are produced. \nWe observe that Rule 112(D) of the Pennsylvania Rules \nof Criminal Procedure allows an attorney for the Commonwealth, \nfor an affiant, or for the defendant to make recordings to \nprepare a record although it prohibits any dissemination to the \n-21- \n \n\nCase 2:19-cv-03110-HB   Document 51   Filed 02/25/20   Page 22 of 26\npublic of such recordings.  This exception allowing recordings, \nto say nothing about the existence of the Philadelphia Municipal \nCourtโs own inferior recordings for internal purposes, undercuts \nthe defendantsโ argument about the arresteeโs fear of speaking \nfrankly if a recording is being made. \nPublic access to bail hearings is clearly guaranteed \nunder the First Amendment.  Official audio recordings or \ntranscripts of such hearings are not required under Rule 115 of \nthe Pennsylvania Rules of Criminal Procedure and in fact such \nrecordings are not being made.  If the hearings were officially \nrecorded, the public would have a constitutional right of access \nto the recordings or to the transcripts absent compelling \ncircumstances not demonstrated here.  In the cases which have \ndenied the public the constitutional right to record judicial \nproceedings, there has been no hint that there would be no \nofficial record for public scrutiny.9 \nUnder the narrow circumstances present here, we must \nbalance the ability of the court to constrain the behavior and \nactions of those in the courtroom against the public right of \nmeaningful access.  In deciding the matter, we must take into \n \n9.  We note, for example, that all bail hearings before the \nMagistrate Judges in the United States District Court for the \nEastern District of Pennsylvania are officially recorded and the \nrecordings and transcripts are available for purchase by the \npublic.  \n-22- \n \n\nCase 2:19-cv-03110-HB   Document 51   Filed 02/25/20   Page 23 of 26\naccount the importance our Court of Appeals has placed on the \nofficial or objective record.  There are over 90 bail hearings a \nday in Philadelphia and each usually lasts less than four \nminutes on average.  Absent an official record other than a \nruling set forth on a form, attendance and notes alone are \ninsufficient to comprehend the full import of these numerous and \nrapid hearings.  While an arrestee has a right of immediate \nappeal de novo to a Municipal Court judge, the appeal is \nconducted by telephone with no video link to the arrestee and no \nrecording of that proceeding.  The public has less access to the \nde novo appeal than to the hearing before the magistrate.  \nThe scales tip in favor of the publicโs right to \naudio-record in a non-disruptive and quiet manner the \npreliminary arraignment and the determination of bail where the \ncourt has a policy or custom not to make official audio \nrecordings or transcripts of its own.  There is here an \nโessential nexus between the right of accessโ and the right to \naudio-record the proceedings.  See Whiteland Woods, 193 F.3d at \n183-84.  The right to attend and take notes and then to obtain \nstatistical data about bail hearings after the fact is not \nadequate under the circumstances presented to vindicate the \npublicโs First Amendment right of access to the courts.  To \nreiterate what our Court of Appeals wrote in Antar: \n-23- \n \n\nCase 2:19-cv-03110-HB   Document 51   Filed 02/25/20   Page 24 of 26\nIt would be an odd result indeed were we to \ndeclare that our courtrooms must be open, \nbut that transcripts of the proceedings \noccurring there may be closed, for what \nexists of the right of access if it extends \nonly to those who can squeeze through the \ndoor. \n \n38 F.3d at 1360. \n \nV \nThe court will grant the motion of plaintiff for \nsummary judgment on its constitutional claim and will deny the \ncross-motions of all defendants for summary judgment on that \nclaim.  The court declares that Rule 112(C) of the Pennsylvania \nRules of Criminal Procedure, Rule 1910 of the Pennsylvania Rules \nof Judicial Administration, and the Philadelphia Municipal Court \nArraignment Court Magistrate rule 7.09 are unconstitutional \nunder the First Amendment insofar as they prohibit the public to \naudio-record bail hearings.  Our holding is limited to the \npresent circumstances in which the Philadelphia Municipal Court \ndoes not make available to the public either its own official \naudio recordings or transcripts of the bail hearings of the same \ntype and quality and in the same manner that are made available \nfor other judicial proceedings. \nThe law in our view is well established as recited \nabove that plaintiff is not entitled under the First Amendment \nto make its own audio recordings if the public can obtain \nofficial audio recordings or transcripts from the Philadelphia \n-24- \n \n\nCase 2:19-cv-03110-HB   Document 51   Filed 02/25/20   Page 25 of 26\nMunicipal Court.  Thus, the validity of the court rules in \nquestion may be saved by making such audio recordings or \ntranscripts publicly available.  No state law or rule called to \nour attention prevents the court from taking this step. \nIf after 45 days from the date of the order entered in \nthis case the Philadelphia Municipal Court has not made official \njudicial recordings or transcripts of bail hearings available to \nthe public as set forth above, the plaintiff may then make its \nown audio recordings of said hearings by use of silent hand-held \nrecorders.  The court will continue to maintain jurisdiction of \nthis action and will require defendants to notify the court \nwhether such recordings or transcripts are now obtainable no \nlater than 45 days after the entry of the order herein. \nVI \nFinally, the Sheriff of Philadelphia County, who is \nbeing sued in her official capacity, makes an additional \nargument that she cannot be held liable for attorneyโs fees and \ncosts even if the plaintiff prevails on its constitutional claim \nunder ยง 1983.  Title 42 U.S.C. ยง 1988(b) provides in relevant \npart: \nIn any action or proceedings to enforce a \nprovision of . . . ยง 1983 . . . the court, \nin its discretion, may allow the prevailing \nparty, other than the United States, a \nreasonable attorneyโs fee as part of the \ncosts, except that in any action brought \nagainst a judicial officer for an act or \n-25- \n \n\nCase 2:19-cv-03110-HB   Document 51   Filed 02/25/20   Page 26 of 26\nomission taken in such officerโs judicial \ncapacity such officer shall not be held \nliable for any costs, including attorneyโs \nfees, unless such action was clearly in \nexcess of such officerโs jurisdiction. \n \nPlaintiff does not seek attorneyโs fees and costs against the \nArraignment Court Magistrates or the Philadelphia Municipal \nCourt President Judge.  It has not presented any evidence that \nthese defendant judicial officers have acted โclearly in excess \nof . . .[their] jurisdiction.โ \n    The Sheriff, as noted above, has been sued in her \nofficial capacity and is acting as an agent of the judicial \nofficials who have promulgated and have directed her to enforce \nthe state and local court rules against audio recordings by the \npublic in the courtroom.  See Kentucky v. Graham, 473 U.S. 159, \n163-66 (1985).  If the judicial defendants cannot be liable for \nattorneyโs fees and costs, surely attorneyโs fees and costs \ncannot be awarded against the Sheriff, who is merely acting at \ntheir behest without discretion to do otherwise. \n    Accordingly, the Sheriff is entitled to summary \njudgment in her favor to the extent plaintiff seeks attorneyโs \nfees and costs against her in her official capacity.  The \nSheriffโs cross-claim against the judicial defendants for \nindemnity for attorneyโs fees and costs will be denied as moot. \n-26- \n ",

Because that decision conflicts with our precedent \ncriminal  proceedings  that  may  lead  to  deprivation  of  and will inflict deep and lasting harms on the right of \nliberty.  access  and the  values  that  right  serves,  I  respectfully \n   dissent. \nThat promise is left unfulfilled today. While this case    \narises  in  the  context  of  bail  hearings,  the  Majorityโs \nholding will reverberate far beyond the confines of the  All Citations \nMagistratesโ  basement  courtroom,  with  troubling \nconsequences  for  a  wide  range  of  judicial  and  other  976 F.3d 302 \ngovernmental proceedings. Public dialogue is only as rich   \nas  the  information  on  which  it  is  based,  but  todayโs \nFootnotes \n \n1  After an arrest, law enforcement processes the arrestee and creates a police arrest report. Thereafter, Pretrial \n  Services  interviews  the  arrestee  and  inquires  into  certain  biographical  information,  including  the  arresteeโs \nresidence, employment, health, and education level. The results of that interview are compiled into a report, which \nthen is submitted to the bail magistrate prior to the bail hearing. \n \n2  The arrestee ordinarily is confined at a Philadelphia police precinct. The bail magistrate, prosecutor, defender, and \n  (if applicable) the public are located in a bail hearing courtroom in the basement of the Philadelphia Criminal Justice \nCenter. The arrestee appears in court via an audio-visual link on a monitor, and all participants are able to hear and \nsee each other via the audio-visual link. \n \n3  The bail hearings are audio-recorded but for โinternal review purposesโ only. (JA 061.) It is undisputed that these \n  unofficial audio recordings are not created in accordance with Pennsylvaniaโs First Judicial District Digital Recording \nProgram, which governs the production of official court recordings. Moreover, the quality of these unofficial \nrecordings and whether they adequately and accurately capture the contents of bail hearings is questionable. \nIndeed, all parties agreed to admit as part of the record that the unofficial audio recordings are of โinferior quality \nand often hard to hearโ. (JA 012; see also JA 012 n.5.) Thus, the fact that the Philadelphia Municipal Court creates \nunofficial audio recordings of the bail hearings cannot be regarded as a basis on which to hold that verbatim \ndocumentation of bail hearings already exists. Nevertheless, we realize that the dissent makes much of the fact that, \nin order to comply with the District Courtโs order, the Municipal Court has begun to make available certified \ntranscripts of bail hearings based upon these recordings. See e.g., Dissent at 319 n.7. (Status Rpt., Exh. A, ECF No. \n38.) This retrospective discussion elevates results over process and loses sight of the fact that the issue before us is \nwhether the First Amendment mandated their creation at the outset, not whether they can be made. \n \n4  Pennsylvania Rule of Criminal Procedure 112(C) prohibits the public from making โstenographic, mechanical, or \n  electronic recording[s]โ of criminal proceedings; Pennsylvania Rule of Judicial Administration 1910(B) states that \nโjudges shall prohibit broadcasting, televising, recording or taking photographs in the courtroomโ; and Local \nArraignment Court Magistrate Rule 7.09 specifically directs bail magistrates to โprohibit broadcasting, televising, \nrecording, or taking photographs in the [c]ourtroom.โ \n \n5  The bulk data for each case includes 44 different categories of information, including the bail type, amount, and \n  16 \n \n\n \n \n  whether it was posted, as well as data regarding the individual defendant, such as his or her race, sex, age, and \nresidence zip code. \n \n6  The dissentโs contention that our opinion confuses the First Amendment right of access with its common law \n  predecessor is baseless. See Dissent at 324โ26. Although this mischaracterization may bolster an overly broad \nreading of our First Amendment precedent, the dissent finds no support for its assertion in our analysis, as \nexemplified by its reliance on our reference to Nixon, 435 U.S. at 597, 98 S.Ct. 1306, a citation clearly preceded by a \nโcf.โ signal and, importantly, recognizing the permissive nature of the common law right of access to judicial \ndocuments. See also Antar, 38 F.3d at 1361 (recognizing that the โcommon law right has played a crucial role in the \ndevelopment of First Amendment jurisprudenceโ). Moreover, in arguing that we conflate the First Amendment right \nof access with the District Courtโs fashioned remedy, see Dissent at 325โ27, the dissent emphatically contends that \nthe First Amendment right of access is, at heart, a right to information, a point not in dispute, see Dissent at 325โ26. \nYet, as noted, even under the challenged Rules, the Bail Fund maintains access to a mass of information, not merely \naccess to the courtroom itself and the notes its volunteers take at the bail hearings, but also the criminal complaint, \ncourt docket, and bulk data information. The Bail Fund is able to, and indeed has, disseminated this information to \nthe public. Of note here, however, is that the Bail Fund seeks a specific kind of informationโa verbatim record (see \nOral Arg. Tr. 37:16-18)โand it is on this issue that we focus. \n \n7  We agree that the First Amendment right of access applies to bail hearingsโa matter that was not in dispute, but \n  nonetheless had not yet been addressed by this Court. See Dissent at 314. \n \n8  In Finesilver, the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit denied a petition for a writ of mandamus that sought to \n  require a district court to allow television coverage of settlement negotiations taking place at a federal courthouse. \nSee Finesilver, 672 F.2d at 819. The district court allowed the press to be present during the negotiations but \nprohibited the placement of television cameras in the meeting rooms. Id. at 820. In denying the petition, the court \nof appeals noted that the petitioner โwas not denied access to the meetingsโ because โ[i]ts representative was free \nto attend, take notes, and disseminate any information obtained.โ Id. at 821. \n \n9  In Garrett, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit noted that the press and the public were permitted to witness \n  prisoner executions, but that the press was not permitted to film the executions because, among other things, โthe \n[F]irst [A]mendment[ ] does not impose upon government โthe affirmative duty to make available to journalists \nsources of information not available to members of the public generally.โ โ Garrett, 556 F.2d at 1279 (quoting Pell v. \nProcunier, 417 U.S. 817, 834-35, 94 S. Ct. 2800, 2810, 41 L.Ed.2d 495 (1974)). \n \n1  The District Courtโs chosen remedy reflects a measured approach to implementing the First Amendment right at \n  issue. In particular, the Court ordered that the Bail Fund โmay make its own audio recordings of bail hearings in the \nPhiladelphia Municipal Court with silent handheld recorders beginning on June 9, 2020 but only if the Philadelphia \nMunicipal Court does not make available by that time official audio recordings or transcripts of bail hearings of the \nsame type and quality and in the same manner that are made available for other types of judicial proceedings.โ J.A. \n125. \n \n2  Even Justices writing in dissent have understood the First Amendment right in these terms. See, e.g., Press-Enter. Co. \n  17 \n \n\n \n \n  v. Superior Ct. (Press-Enterprise II), 478 U.S. 1, 18, 106 S.Ct. 2735, 92 L.Ed.2d 1 (1986) (Stevens, J., dissenting) (โ[T]he \nFirst Amendment embraces a right of access to information about the conduct of public affairs.โ); Globe Newspaper, \n457 U.S. at 615, 102 S.Ct. 2613 (Burger, C.J., dissenting) (focusing on whether the government โdenied the public or \nthe media access to information as to what t[ook] place at trial,โ including in the form of โthe trial transcriptโ and \nโother sources of information about the [relevant] testimonyโ). \n \n3  In a later decision, we suggested this aspect of Whiteland Woods might have been dicta. See N. Jersey Media Grp., \n  Inc. v. Ashcroft, 308 F.3d 198, 214 (3d Cir. 2002). It was not. In Whiteland Woods, a developer sought to videotape \none of the commissionโs meetings but was denied. 193 F.3d at 178. After the township โagreed not to enforce the \n[videotaping] ban at future meetings,โ the developer sued for damages under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983. Id. One obstacle \nstanding in the way of the developerโs damages claim was the argument that the First Amendment right of access \ndid not apply at all to public proceedings of that kind. But after applying our experience-and-logic test, see infra \nSection I.B, we held that the developer โhad a constitutional right of accessโ to planning commission meetings. \nWhiteland Woods, 193 F.3d at 180โ81. Although ultimately we rejected the damages claim on narrower grounds, \nsee id. at 184, Whiteland Woodsโs analysis of the right of accessโs application remains an integral part of that \ndecision, one not subject to erasure by a subsequent panelโs comment. See Pardini v. Allegheny Intermediate Unit, \n524 F.3d 419, 426 (3d Cir. 2008) (where a later panel decision โis inconsistent with [an earlier case, the later \ndecision] must be deemed without effect.โ (citations omitted)). \n \n4  See, e.g., Will Dobbie et al., The Effects of Pretrial Detention on Conviction, Future Crime, and Employment: Evidence \n  from Randomly Assigned Judges, 108 Am. Econ. Rev. 201, 204 (2018) (โInitial pretrial release increases the \nprobability of employment in the formal labor market three to four years after the bail hearing by 9.4 percentage \npoints, a 24.9 percent increase from the detained defendant mean.โ); id. at 203โ04 (examining other effects of \ninitial pretrial detention versus release); Erica Kates, Wellesley Ctrs. for Women, Moving Beyond Incarceration for \nWomen in Massachusetts: The Necessity of Bail/Pretrial Reform 2, 4โ5 (2015), https://bit.ly/2CseGoR (showing that \nalmost 50% of women in pretrial detention were at risk of losing their homes); Megan T. Stevenson, Distortion of \nJustice: How the Inability to Pay Bail Affects Case Outcomes, 34 J.L. Econ. & Org. 511, 512โ13 (2018) (finding, based \non data from Philadelphia, that โpretrial detention leads to a 13% increase in the likelihood of being convicted on at \nleast one charge,โ โa 42% increase in the incarceration sentence,โ and โa 41% increase in courtroom debtโ). I thank \namici for identifying these helpful resources. \n \n5  See, e.g., Chris Palmer, Tensions Are Boiling Over Between Philly DA Larry Krasner and Bail Reform Advocates, Phila. \n  Inquirer (July 29, 2020), https://bit.ly/3aqYUY1. See generally Report of the Special Master, Phila. Cmty. Bail Fund v. \nArraignment Ct. Magistrates, No. 21 EM 2019 (Pa. Dec. 16, 2019). \n \n6  The Majority highlights that Whiteland Woods cited two out-of-circuit opinions approving nonverbatim modes of \n  collecting information about government actions. Maj. Op. 307โ08. It omits the third case Whiteland Woods cited, \nwhich rejected a bid to videotape proceedings only because โaudiotaping was permitted.โ Id. (citing Johnson v. \nAdams, 629 F. Supp. 1563, 1564โ65 (E.D. Tex. 1986)); see Johnson, 629 F. Supp. at 1564 (emphasizing that โthe \npublic and the press [we]re allowed to audio tape the proceedingsโ using โa tape recorder or any other means of \nsonic reproductionโ (citation omitted)). And as for the two cases the Majority mentions, I find them to be of minimal \nassistance. The first, which involved a one-day redistricting negotiation open to members of the press, arose in the \ncontext of a petition for a writ of mandamus. Combined Commcโns Corp. v. Finesilver, 672 F.2d 818, 819โ20 (10th \nCir. 1982). That matters: Mandamus is available only where the right at issue is โclear and indisputable,โ Kerr v. U.S. \nDist. Ct. for the N. Dist. of Cal., 426 U.S. 394, 403, 96 S.Ct. 2119, 48 L.Ed.2d 725 (1976) (citation omitted), but the \n  18 \n \n\n \n \nFinesilver court faced โunsettledโ territory ill suited to the writ, 672 F.2d at 821. The second case, Garrett v. Estelle, \n556 F.2d 1274 (5th Cir. 1977), involved a reporter who sought to โfilm executions in state prison,โ id. at 1275, and \nthus implicated unique interests related to โprison access,โ id. at 1278. And Garrett, much like Finesilver, could not \nbenefit from the Supreme Courtโs exegeses on the right of access in Press-Enterprise I and Press-Enterprise II, which \ncame later in the decade. Above all, neither Garrett nor Finesilver involved criminal hearings remotely like the bail \nproceedings here, and consequently their analysis has little to teach us. \n \n7  Initially, before the District Court, the Magistrates asserted the audio recordings were of โinferior qualityโ and were \n  โoften hard to hear.โ Phila. Bail Fund, 440 F. Supp. 3d at 418. Although that assertion was included among the \nstipulated facts, see id. at 418 n.5, we are obligated in this First Amendment case to undertake โan independent \nexamination of the record,โ see Melrose, Inc. v. City of Pittsburgh, 613 F.3d 380, 387 (3d Cir. 2010) (citation \nomitted). And two aspects of the record before us engender skepticism about the recordingsโ allegedly poor quality. \nFirst, the recordings have always been of sufficient quality for the Municipal Court to use them for internal \npurposes, including not only โto address technical issuesโ but also โto enable the President Judge of the Municipal \nCourt to monitor the performance of the magistrates.โ Phila. Bail Fund, 440 F. Supp. 3d at 418. Second, in a status \nreport filed with the District Court during the pendency of this appealโwhich the Bail Fund brought to our attention \nvia Rule 28(j) letterโthe Magistrates reported that, to comply with the District Courtโs order, the Municipal Court \nhad decided to โmake available certified transcriptsโ of all bail hearings โcreated from the current audio recording \ntechnology present in arraignment court.โ Status Report, supra, at 2. The status report stated that the Municipal \nCourt โha[d] taken steps to ensure that the audio quality [wa]s sufficientโ to make transcripts, id., but did not \nindicate what those steps were, which apparently did not involve changing the technology already in the courtroom. \nIn light of our independent obligation to view the record with fresh eyes and the uses to which the recordings have \nbeen put before and during this litigation, we cannot simply assume that they are of meaningfully poor quality as \ncompared to others of their type. \n \n8  Perhaps the Majority views written transcripts as different in kind from other forms of recordings that are more \n  audioโvisual in nature. But if that is so, the grounds for that distinction are entirely unclear. After all, if the issue is \nthat a court is preparing a recording for its own uses but refusing to allow the public to access it, why should it \nmatter whether that recording is written or audioโvisual? And why would the First Amendment have something to \nsay about the former but not the latter? \n \n9  Although I use the word โcounsel,โ โ[f]requently there are no lawyers in the room participating in the preliminary \n  arraignment hearing.โ Bail Watch Report, supra, at 14. As of late 2018, for instance, โnon-attorneys (e.g. paralegals, \ninterns) often represent[ed] both the Public Defenderโs Office and the District Attorneyโs Office at the hearings.โ Id. \nAnd until recently, it was โextremely rareโ for arrestees and their counsel to have any opportunity to confer and \nbegin building an attorneyโclient relationship before the bail hearing or immediate appeal. Amici Br. of Defender \nAssociation of Philadelphia et al. 14โ15. \n \n10  That is not all. As discussed below, see infra Section II.B.2, โdue process requires some notice to the public before a \n  trial court may close a pretrial criminal proceeding.โ Criden II, 675 F.2d at 558. When combined with the lack of \ncourt-produced transcripts or audio recordings and the prohibition on public recording of any kind, the lack of notice \nbefore bail hearings raises serious due process concerns. \n \n  19 \n \n\n \n \n11  That failure is stark given that all federal bail hearings, along with those in many states, are recorded. See 28 U.S.C. ยง \n  753(b); see also, e.g., Alaska R. Ct. R. Admin. 35(a); Colo. R. Crim. P. 10(d); Mich. Comp. Laws ยง 767.37a(4); Minn. R. \nCrim. P. 5.09; Mont. Code Ann. ยง 46-11-701(1), (4); Neb. Rev. Stat. ยง 29-509; N.M. R. Rec. Jud. Proceedings 22-301; \nOhio Rev. Code Ann. ยง 2937.15; Tenn. Code Ann. ยง 40-14-307. \n \n12  The blunderbuss nature of the restrictions approved today also sets this Court on a collision course with the Due \n  Process Clause. As we have explained, where (as here) the First Amendment right of access attaches, โdue process \nrequires some notice to the public before a ... court may close a pretrial criminal proceeding.โ Criden II, 675 F.2d at \n558. Although the โform that such notice should takeโ may vary from context to context, at least for preliminary \nhearings we have required it to be โcalculated to inform the public that its constitutional rights may be implicated in \na particular criminal proceedingโ and to be docketed โsufficiently in advance of [the] hearing ... to afford interested \nmembers of the public an opportunity to intervene and present their views.โ Id. at 559. We are not called on today \nto set the constitutional baseline for notice due before a bail hearing may be closed. Even so, I raise the issue to \nunderscore the fundamental inconsistency between the Magistratesโ and Majorityโs agreement that the right of \naccess attaches to bail hearings and their simultaneous approval of a system that provides no before-the-fact notice \nand no after-the-fact record of those hearings. \n \n13  Some have wondered whether limitations on the right of access to judicial proceedings may be akin to time, place, \n  and manner restrictions on expressive activities. Richmond Newspapers, 448 U.S. at 581 n.18, 100 S.Ct. 2814 \n(plurality opinion). We have expressed doubts about that idea, particularly as right-of-access jurisprudence does not \nmap neatly onto the forum analysis required by the Free Speech Clause. Whiteland Woods, 193 F.3d at 182โ83; see \nPG Publโg Co. v. Aichele, 705 F.3d 91, 99โ100 (3d Cir. 2013) (because the right of access โfocus[es] ... on access to \ninformation,โ not โexpressive conduct or speech,โ โthe traditional forum analysis is [in]appositeโ). And however far \na time-place-and-manner line of thinking may extend in this context, it does not cover restrictionsโlike the ones \nhereโwhose effect is โto deny or unwarrantedly abridge ... the opportunities for the communication of thought and \nthe discussion of public questionsโ essential to the right of access. Press-Enterprise I, 464 U.S. at 511 n.10, 104 S.Ct. \n819. Still, even if we were to set these doubts to one side, the proffered justifications here would remain concededly \nunsubstantiated and therefore would not pass muster under even the most forgiving of the tests used in public \nforum analysis. See NAACP v. City of Philadelphia, 834 F.3d 435, 443โ44 (3d Cir. 2016) (holding that the government \nmust prove the reasonableness of any regulation in a limited public or nonpublic forum through โrecord evidence or \ncommonsense inferencesโ and that where the record โis strangely void of support,โ the regulation cannot stand). \n \n \n \n  20 \n ",
