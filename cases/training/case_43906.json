The parties may elect to consent to the jurisdiction of a United States Magistrate Judge (USMJ). United States Magistrate Judges do not conduct felony criminal trials; as a result, parties are often able to schedule a civil jury trial before a USMJ sooner and with more flexibility than a jury trial before a DJ. If all parties consent to the jurisdiction of a USMJ, the parties shall complete and jointly file the consent form found at https://www.uscourts.gov/forms/civil-forms/notice-consent-and-reference-civil-action-magistrate-judge. If any party does not consent, that information should not be conveyed to the Court, and no consent form should be filed. The Court notes that ordinarily, where the parties consent to the jurisdiction of a USMJ, any USMJ previously involved in confidential settlement discussions would not be assigned to hear the trial. If no consent form is filed within 14 days, this matter will be automatically reassigned to another district judge. Signed by Clerk on 9/5/2023. (Barry, L) (Entered: 09/05/2023)"

Doc. No. 39-1 at 7. From 2018 to 2021, she served as Principal Deputy Under Secretary for Benefits and oversaw \"a nationwide network of 56 regional offices[.]\" Id. at 15. In 2021, Devlin was the VA's Chief Learning Officer. Id. Devlin is now the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Operations and Management in the United States Department of Labor. Doc. No. 34-1 at 11. Devlin appears to be in a high-ranking position, but Plaintiffs have demonstrated \"exceptional circumstances justifying [her] deposition.\" Lederman v. New York City Dep't of Parks & Recreation, 731 F.3d 199, 203 (2d Cir. 2013). Devlin has \"unique first-hand knowledge\" of \"necessary information [that] cannot be obtained through other, less burdensome or intrusive means.\" Id. Her deposition is critical to Plaintiffs precisely because of her supervisory roles during the period Plaintiffs allege the VA failed to remedy racial discrimination in benefits administration. If Plaintiffs could not depose Ms. Devlin, they would likely need to take numerous depositions of VA employees across multiple regional offices and would have to piece together disjointed facts. Devlin furthermore has \"unique first-hand knowledge related to the litigated claims,\" especially Plaintiffs' negligent supervision claim. Id. In 2017, the same year Plaintiffs allege a \"draft VA report showed that there was a significant disparity in grant rates for PTSD claims between Blacks and other groups[,]\" Devlin served a supervisory role in the Veterans Benefit Administration. Am. Compl., Doc. No. 36 par. 69. It therefore appears Plaintiffs could not obtain information relevant to their negligent supervision claim through other, less intrusive means. Lederman, 731 F.3d at 203.The Court has concluded it has subject matter jurisdiction over the action. Doc. No. 83. The stay on discovery is now lifted. Signed by District Judge Stefan R.

    "summary": "<p>This case concerns allegations of systemic discrimination against Black veterans by the U.S. On November 28, 2022, a Black veteran filed this lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut against the United States of America for the acts of its employees under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) and state law. The lawsuit followed a Freedom of Information Act-prompted release of data in 2021 by Veterans Affairs that demonstrated a statistically significant difference in disability compensation claim determinations by race. Plaintiff also filed administrative complaints with Veterans Affairs on behalf of both himself and his father, also a veteran whose estate he administrated. Plaintiff did not receive a response from the department on either complaint, exhausting available administrative remedies.</p>\r\n<p>The case was assigned to Judge Janet Bond Arterton. Represented by Yale Law School's Veterans Legal Services Clinic at the Jerome N. Frank Legal Services Organization, the plaintiff alleged that the Department of Veteran Affairs and its predecessor, the Veterans' Administration, (collectively \"VA\") racially discriminated against black veterans by denying their meritorious applications at statistically higher rates compared to their white counterparts. Plaintiff asserted claims for negligence, negligent infliction of emotional distress, and negligent supervision, alleging that he was repeatedly and erroneously denied veterans' benefits in the form of education assistance, home loans, and disability compensation for several years. He sought compensatory damages and attorneys' fees as remedies for the harm caused by being forced to interact with a racially discriminatory benefits system.</p>\r\n<p>On December 5, 2022, an individual filed a pro se motion for class certification. The motion did not conform to the standards of a class certification motion and seemed to be given little merit by either party. The court ruled against the motion on June 7, 2023, due to plaintiff's decision to file an amended complaint.</p>\r\n<p>The U.S. filed a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction and sought to stay discovery pending the court's decision on the motion to dismiss on March 31, 2023. Plaintiff opposed both motions. The U.S. also sought a protective order following a deposition request.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Plaintiff filed an amended complaint on June 5, 2023. The main differences in the amended complaint were the addition of an organizational plaintiff, the National Veterans Council for Legal Redress (NVCLR), and class action allegations. Plaintiffs sought class certification of: \"All Black applicants for veterans' benefits administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs or its predecessor at any time since January 1, 1945 and who have or will in the future have satisfied the exhaustion requirement imposed by 28 U.S.C. &sect; 2675.\" The complaint specified how the proposed class met the standard requirements of numerosity, commonality, and typicality.</p>\r\n<p>A hearing on the motion to dismiss was held on November 2, 2023.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>As of November 7, 2023, the case is still ongoing.</p>",

      "text": "Case 3:22-cv-01503-JBA   Document 1   Filed 11/28/22   Page 1 of 27\n \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF CONNECTICUT  \n  \n     \nCONLEY F. MONK JR.,     \n     \nPlaintiff,     \n   Civil Action No. 3:22-cv-1503 \nv.     \n     \nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA,   November 28, 2022  \n     \nDefendant.     \n     \n \nCOMPLAINT \n1.  The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and its predecessor, the Veteransโ \nAdministration (collectively โVAโ), have operated generous programs of education, housing, \ndisability compensation, and other benefits since World War II. For decades, there have been \nanecedotal reports and widespread suspicion of racial discrimination in these programs. \n2.  In 2021, in response to Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) litigation, VA \ndisclosed records confirming these long-held suspicions for the first time. Analysis of these \nrecords reveals a statistically significant difference in VA disability compensation claim \ndeterminations based on race from 2001 to 2020, the period for which VA disclosed data. Each \nyear, VA was more likely to reject applications of Black veterans than of white veterans. \n3.  The result of VAโs racial discrimination has been to deny countless meritorious \napplications by Black veterans, depriving them and their families of care and support that their \nfaithful service had earned. \n4.  Plaintiff Conley Monk Jr. is one of these veterans. Mr. Monk comes from a \nfamily of Black service members; his father was in a segregated U.S. Army unit during World \nWar II and fought at Normandy, and a number of his siblings served in the armed forces. Mr. \n\nCase 3:22-cv-01503-JBA   Document 1   Filed 11/28/22   Page 2 of 27\n \nMonk himself joined the U.S. Marine Corps after high school and served in combat in Vietnam, \nwhere he was promoted to lance corporal and also seriously wounded.  \n5.  For nearly fifty years after he returned home to Connecticut in 1970, the VA \nimproperly denied Mr. Monkโs applications for education, housing, and disability benefits. Mr. \nMonk suspected racial bias at the VA but had no way to prove it. \n6.  VA eventually granted Mr. Monk benefits in 2015 and again in 2020, confirming \nthat he was disabled by wounds suffered during his military service and eligible for disability \ncompensation. But VA has never fully compensated him for the harm it caused by repeatedly \ndenying his benefits appplications.  \n7.  Last year, for the first time, Mr. Monk learned of concrete evidence of persistent \nracial disparities in VA benefits programs, namely the 2021 statistical analysis described above. \nThis analysis was based on records that VA disclosed in FOIA litigation brought by Mr. Monkโs \norganization, the National Veterans Council for Legal Redress, and the Black Veterans Project.  \n8.  In early 2022 Mr. Monk filed an administrative claim with the VA. He alleged \nthat because VA leaders knew or should have known of pervasive racial disparities in the award \nof VA benefits, and because they nevertheless failed to address these disparities, VA leadership \nnegligently breached its statutory duty of care under 38 U.S.C. ยง 303 (2018) and 38 U.S.C. \nยง 210(b) (1958). VA has not responded to Mr. Monkโs administrative claim.  \n9.  Mr. Monk is not seeking to relitigate his individual benefits requests. Instead, he \nseeks to recover for the harm caused to him by VA leadersโ negligent failure to redress the \nlongstanding racial disparities in veteransโ benefits administration, about which leadership has \nknown or should have known for decades. \n10.  VAโs tortious conduct caused Mr. Monk to suffer periods of housing insecurity, \n  2 \n\nCase 3:22-cv-01503-JBA   Document 1   Filed 11/28/22   Page 3 of 27\n \nfinancial hardship, and difficulty accessing proper medical care. He suffered severe emotional \nharm when he was forced to repeatedly relive the most traumatic moments of his life as part of \nhis applications and re-applications for disability compensation. And he suffered dignitary and \nreputational harm as a result of VAโs discriminatory actions.  \n11.  Having exhausted his administrative remedies, Mr. Monk brings this action \npursuant to the Federal Tort Claims Act. He asserts claims for negligence, negligent infliction of \nemotional distress, and negligent supervision, and seeks thereby to redress the harms caused to \nhim by the failure of VA leaders and staff to administer their benefits programs in a manner free \nfrom racial discrimination against Black veterans. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n12.  This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยงยง 1331 and 1346(b). \n13.  Venue is proper under 28 U.S.C. ยงยง 1402(b) and 1391(e)(1) because Plaintiff \nresides in the District of Connecticut, a substantial part of the events, acts, or omissions giving \nrise to the claims occurred in this District, and no real property is involved in this action.  \nPARTIES \n14.  Plaintiff Conley F. Monk Jr. is a 74-year-old resident of New Haven, Connecticut. \nHe is a veteran of the U.S. Marine Corps, served with distinction in the Vietnam War, and \ncontinues to advocate for veterans as the co-founder and Director of the National Veterans \nCouncil for Legal Redress (NVCLR).   \n15.  Defendant United States of America is sued under the Federal Tort Claims Act \n(FTCA) for the tortious acts of its employees, including employees of the Department of \nVeterans Affairs and its predecessor agency, the Veteransโ Administration.  \n   \n  3 \n\nCase 3:22-cv-01503-JBA   Document 1   Filed 11/28/22   Page 4 of 27\n \nLEGAL FRAMEWORK \n16.  The United States Government has provided assistance for individuals who served \nin the nationโs armed forces since 1776, when the Continental Congress established disability \npensions for veterans โ the predecessor to todayโs disability compensation program.  \n17.  In 1944, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the Servicemenโs Readjustment \nAct of 1944 (โG.I. Billโ) providing, among other things, sweeping education and home loan \nbenefits to World War II veterans.  \n18.  At the signing ceremony, President Roosevelt remarked that the G.I. Bill and \nearlier legislation โprovide the special benefits which are due to the members of our armed \nforcesโfor they have been compelled to make greater economic sacrifice and every other kind \nof sacrifice than the rest of us, and are entitled to definite action to help take care of their special \nproblems.โ  \nEducation Benefits \n19.  The G.I. Billโs education benefits were intended to give servicemembers the \nopportunity to resume their education or technical training after their discharge from the military. \nUnder the original legislation, eligible veterans who enrolled in a qualifying educational program \nโ including undergraduate and professional schools, vocational schools, apprenticeships, and \nscientific and technical institutions, among others โ could receive monetary assistance for tuition, \nbooks, supplies, and other necessary expenses from VA to complete their education.  \n20.  After the original G.I. Bill expired in 1956, Congress continued to fund and \nexpand education benefits for veterans.   \n21.  In 1976, when Mr. Monk applied for VA education benefits, eligible veterans \ncould receive a monthly cash benefit (based on their number of dependents) to cover educational \n  4 \n\nCase 3:22-cv-01503-JBA   Document 1   Filed 11/28/22   Page 5 of 27\n \ncosts and a loan from VA (based on the governmentโs determination of financial need) to cover \nthe cost of tuition.  \n22.  Approximately 20 million veterans have benefited from the education benefits \nprogram initially established by the G.I. Bill. The program has enabled veterans to pursue \nuniversity courses, certificate programs, on-the-job training, apprenticeship training, flight \ntraining, and non-college degree courses.  \nHome Loan Benefits \n23.  Like VA education benefits, the VA home loan program was created by the \noriginal G.I. Bill in 1944. The program was designed to help veterans purchase and retain their \nhomes through government-guaranteed loans.   \n24.  Under the original VA home loan program, veterans could apply for home loan \nguarantees from VA of up to 50 percent of the loan amount, not to exceed $2,000. Since 1944, \nCongress has amended the program to increase the guaranty to up to $45,000.  \n25.  In 1983, at the time Mr. Monk applied for a home loan guaranty from VA, \nveterans could receive a guaranty of up to $27,500.  \n26.  As of October 2020, VA has guaranteed more than 25 million home loans.  \nDisability Compensation \n27.  The VA disability compensation program provides support for veterans who were \ninjured during their military service or whose condition worsened as a result of their service.  \n28.  Current VA disability compensation provides a monthly tax-free cash benefit to \nveterans with disabilities that are the result of a disease or injury incurred or aggravated during \nactive military service. Depending on the degree of disability and number of dependents, a \nveteran may receive more than $4,000 in monthly cash benefits.   \n  5 \n\nCase 3:22-cv-01503-JBA   Document 1   Filed 11/28/22   Page 6 of 27\n \n29.  The amount of disability compensation that Mr. Monk could have received when \nhe first applied in 1982 is uncertain based on publicly available information. In 2010, the second \ntime Mr. Monk applied for disability compensation, a veteran with a spouse could earn up to \n$2,823 per month in benefits from VA. In 2012, the last time Mr. Monk applied for disability \ncompensation, a veteran with a spouse could earn up to $2,973 per month in benefits from VA. \n30.  In fiscal year 2021, VA provided over $112 billion in disability compensation to \napproximately 5.6 million veterans and their families.  \nEligibility for Education, Housing, and Disability Benefits \n31.  In addition to eligibility criteria specific to each VA benefits program, individuals \nare eligible for education, housing, and disability benefits only if they are considered a โveteranโ \nunder 38 U.S.C. ยง 101(2). The statute defines veterans as those individuals who were discharged \nfrom the military โunder conditions other than dishonorable.โ Id. \n32.  Individuals who receive an Honorable, General under Honorable, or \nUncharacterized discharge are generally eligible for these VA benefits, unless a statutory bar \napplies. See 38 U.S.C. ยง 5303; 38 C.F.R. ยง 3.12. \n33.  Individuals who receive a Dishonorable discharge are not considered veterans and \nare ineligible for these VA benefits. 38 U.S.C. ยง 101(2).  \n34.  Individuals who receive an Other than Honorable (previously โUndesirableโ) or \nBad Conduct discharge may be eligible for VA benefits. When a person with such a discharge \napplies for benefits, VA must conduct a โcharacter of dischargeโ (COD) assessment to determine \nwhether such a discharge was โunder conditions other than dishonorable,โ taking into \nconsideration the personโs military records and any other evidence submitted. 38 C.F.R. ยง 3.12.  \n  6 \n\nCase 3:22-cv-01503-JBA   Document 1   Filed 11/28/22   Page 7 of 27\n \nVAโs Duty to Administer Education, Housing, and Disability Benefits \n35.  The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and its predecessor agency, the \nVeteransโ Administration, have been responsible for administering veteransโ education, housing, \nand disability benefits programs.  \n36.  On July 3, 1930, Congress established the Veteransโ Administration, headed by \nthe VA Administrator.  \n37.  Until 1957, federal law stated that the VA Administrator, โunder the direction of \nthe President, shall have the control, direction, and management of the various agencies and \nactivities [enumerated herein]โ concerning the โadministration of the laws relating to the relief \nand other benefits provided by lawโ for veterans. 38 U.S.C. ยง 11 (1934).  \n38.  In 1957, Congress amended the statute, providing that the โAdministrator . . . is \nresponsible for the proper execution and administration of all laws administered by the \nVeteransโ Administration and for the control, direction, and management of the Veteransโ \nAdministration.โ Veteransโ Benefits Act of 1957, Pub. L. No. 85-56, 71 Stat. 83, 91-92 (1957) \n(emphasis added); 38 U.S.C. ยง 210(b) (1958). \n39.  In October 1988, President Reagan elevated the Veteransโ Administration to a \nCabinet-level department. The Veteransโ Administration officially became the modern-day U.S. \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs on March 15, 1989.  \n40.  On August 6, 1991, Congress passed the Department of Veterans Affairs \nCodification Act, establishing the purpose and structure of the new Department. Congress \nimposed the same duty of care on the Secretary of Veterans Affairs as it did on the former VA \nAdministrator, providing that the VA Secretary is โresponsible for the proper execution and \nadministration of all laws administered by the Department and for the control, direction, and \n  7 \n\nCase 3:22-cv-01503-JBA   Document 1   Filed 11/28/22   Page 8 of 27\n \nmanagement of the Department.โ 38 U.S.C. ยง 303 (emphasis added). \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \nA.  VA Officials Breached Their Duty of Care by Administering Benefits in a \nRacially Discriminatory Manner \n \n41.  On February 22, 2021, Mr. Monkโs organization, NVCLR, along with the Black \nVeterans Project (BVP) filed Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests with three \ncomponents of VA. These FOIA requests sought information regarding the administration of \nservice-connected disability compensation, as that program is the largest veteransโ benefits \nprogram and serves the most veterans. The disability compensation program also directly harmed \nMr. Monk, as he was repeatedly denied benefits for years.  \n42.  VA provided responses to some, but not all, of these FOIA requests. Due to the \ninadequacy of VAโs response, NVCLR and BVP filed administrative appeals and, after VA \nfailed to respond fully and adequately, a complaint in U.S. district court. After months of \nlitigation, in 2021 VA conducted further searches and produced additional documents.  \n43.      The records disclosed by VA included claims outcomes for veterans from 2001 \nto 2020. The data did not cover previous years because, VA represented, it did not link ratings \ndecision data to specific files and did not fully retain disability decision data prior to 2001. \n44.  Through their counsel, NVCLR and BVP consulted a Yale University statistician \nto analyze the VA records.  \n45.  The analysis found a statistically significant difference in VA claim outcomes (the \nnumber of claims denied, partially granted, or granted) between: (1) Black veterans and white \nveterans; (2) Black male veterans and white male veterans; and (3) Black female veterans and \nwhite female veterans. \n  8 \n\nCase 3:22-cv-01503-JBA   Document 1   Filed 11/28/22   Page 9 of 27\n \n46.  VA denied Black veterans, Black male veterans, and Black female veterans \ndisability compensation at statistically higher rates than their white counterparts. For instance, \nbetween 2001 to 2020, the average denial rate for disability compensation was 29.5% for Black \nveterans and 24.2% for white veterans.  \n47.  In addition, the statisticianโs analysis found that the VAโs average grant rate for \ndisability compensation was 30.3% for Black veterans and 37.1% for white veterans. This is also \na statistically significant disparity.  \n48.  The data showed that from 2002 to 2020, a Black veteran applying for disability \ncompensation was more likely to be denied than a white veteran. This data is displayed below. \nPercentage of Disability Claims Denied\n35%\n30%\n25%\n20%\n15%\n10%\n5%\n0%\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2\n2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0\nWhite Veterans Black Veterans\n \n \n49.  On information and belief, additional records possessed by VA and not yet \npublicly disclosed further confirm racial disparities in the administration of VA benefits \nprograms since World War II and a disparate impact on Black veterans, of which VA leaders \nknew or should have known and negligently failed to redress. \n  9 \n\nCase 3:22-cv-01503-JBA   Document 1   Filed 11/28/22   Page 10 of 27\n \nB.  VA Knew or Should Have Known About Racial Discrepancies and Failed to \nRemedy Them  \n \n50.  VA officials violated their statutory obligation and duty of care to properly \nexecute and administer the law when they administered benefits in a manner they knew or should \nhave known resulted in racially disparate outcomes, and when VA leadership negligently failed \nto redress those pervasive racial disparities. \n51.  These officials included every VA Administrator or Secretary since World War II, \nfrom Frank Hines (VA Administrator until 1945) to Secretary Denis McDonough (VA Secretary \n2021-present), as well as each Under Secretary of Veterans Affairs for Benefits and other senior \nVA officials responsible for administering veteransโ benefits programs in the same period. \n52.  For example, the training, supervision, auditing, and record-keeping practices \nimplented by VA leaders caused a disparate impact on Black veterans applying for benefits as \ncompared to white veterans. \n53.  The records that NVCLR and BVP received from VA through their FOIA \nrequests demonstrate that for decades VA leadership, including VA Secretaries, knew or should \nhave known of pervasive, longstanding racial disparities in veteransโ benefits for Black veterans. \nAnd for decades, VA officials have negligently failed to redress these disparities. \n54.  VA officials also knew or should have known that racial bias in the military \njustice system was affecting the discharge status of Black veterans like Mr. Monk, who initially \nreceived an Undesirable (now, Other Than Honorable) discharge.  \n55.  The Defense Departmentโs own analysis shortly after Mr. Monkโs discharge \ndemonstrated that Black servicemembers were substantially more likely than white \nservicemembers to face military justice or disciplinary action. TASK FORCE ON THE ADMIN. OF \nMIL. JUST. IN THE ARMED FORCES, OFF. OF THE ASSISTANT SECโY OF DEF., REPORT OF THE TASK \n  10 \n\nCase 3:22-cv-01503-JBA   Document 1   Filed 11/28/22   Page 11 of 27\n \nFORCE ON THE ADMINISTRATION OF MILITARY JUSTICE IN THE ARMED FORCES VOL. I 32 (1972); \nsee also PETER G. NORDLIE ET AL., U.S. ARMY RESEARCH INSTITUTE FOR THE BEHAVIORAL AND \nSOCIAL SCIENCES, MEASURING CHANGES IN INSTITUTIONAL RACIAL DISCRIMINATION IN THE \nARMY 25 (1975) (finding โa strong relationship between skin color and type of dischargeโ). \n56.  More recent analyses have reached similar conclusions. DANIEL P. MACDONALD, \nET AL., DEFENSE EQUAL OPPORTUNITY MANAGEMENT INSTITUTE DIRECTORATE OF RESEARCH \nDEVELOPMENT AND STRATEGIC INITIATIVES, REPORT OF RACIAL DISPARITIES IN THE MILITARY \nJUSTICE SYSTEM 17 (2017) (finding that Black servicemembers were 36.6% and 50% more likely \nto face courts-martial and non-judicial punishments, respectively, than white servicemembers). \n57.  After the 1972 Defense Department Report, the U.S. Equal Employment \nOpportunity Commission (EEOC) concluded that military discharges were so tainted by race \ndiscrimination that an employer who required an honorable discharge as a condition of hiring \nviolated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, absent a business necessity. EEOC Decision \nNo. 74-25 (1973); see also EEOC Decision No. 76-13 (1975) (same, as to blanket refusal to hire \nor re-employ veteran with less-than-honorable discharge), overruled in part on other grounds by \nEEOC Decision No. 80-26 (1980); Dozier v. Chupka, 395 F. Supp. 836 (S.D. Ohio 1975) \n(holding municipal fire department disqualification of applicants with less-than-honorable \ndischarges has impermissible adverse impact based on race). \n58.  Because VA looks to veteransโ service records and discharge status in making \nCOD determinations, VA knew or should have known that bias in the military justice system \nwould likely lead to racial disparities in its COD determinations absent a concerted effort to \nidentify and correct for this effect. \n59.  VA leaders also knew or should have known that placing undue weight on the \n  11 \n\nCase 3:22-cv-01503-JBA   Document 1   Filed 11/28/22   Page 12 of 27\n \nostensibly voluntary nature of an Other than Honorable discharge contributes to racial disparities \nin COD determinations and has the same sort of impermissible disparate impact that the EEOC \ndetermined was unlawful in employment settings.  \n60.  VA failed to rectify these issues, resulting in COD determinations that were based \non racially disparate discharge statuses.  \n61.  The negligence of VA leadership, and their failure to train, supervise, monitor, \nand instruct agency officials to take steps to identify and correct racial disparities, led to \nsystematic benefits obstruction for Black veterans. \n62.  VA officials also negligently failed to collect and aggregate claims data prior to \n2001 in a manner that would have enabled VA to identify the nature and scope of these \ndisparities. Further, VA leaders failed to properly train, supervise, and instruct employees on \nprocedures and practices that would administer benefits in nondiscriminatory ways.  \n63.  VA acknowledged its record-keeping negligence in its FOIA responses, \nconceding that โrating decision data was never directly linked to the Pending Issue File or to the \nCPMR, limiting our ability to link outcomes to claims.โ In addition, disability decision data was \nnot fully retained by VA prior to 2001. VAโs negligence in maintaining a system that could not \ntrack and rectify racial discrepancies harmed thousands of Black veterans.  \n64.  VAโs negligence in failing to create and maintain a system to track claims and \nidentify racial disparities led the agency to fail to properly execute and administer the law, as \nrequired by statute. \nC.  Conley Monk Jr.โs Military Service and Service to Veterans \n65.  Conley Monk Jr. is a proud Black Vietnam War veteran who has been a leader, \nadvocate, and counselor to other veterans for more than 50 years. He is one of thousands of \n  12 \n\nCase 3:22-cv-01503-JBA   Document 1   Filed 11/28/22   Page 13 of 27\n \nBlack veterans harmed by VAโs tortious conduct. \n66.  Mr. Monk was born in Rocky Mount, North Carolina, in 1948 into the \naccomplished Monk family that includes the jazz musician Thelonius Monk, the Hall of Fame \nfootball player Art Monk, and generations of teachers, police officers, and public servants.  \n67.  Mr. Monkโs father, Conley Monk Sr., served in a segregated unit in the U.S. \nArmy during World War II and participated in the Normandy invasion.   \n68.  Mr. Monk moved with his family to Connecticut when he was very young. He \ngrew up and attended public schools in New Haven, and during high school he worked part-time \nat the VA Hospital in West Haven.  \nMr. Monkโs Military Service \n69.  On November 12, 1968, at 20 years old, Mr. Monk voluntarily enlisted in the U.S. \nMarine Corps and continued a long tradition of family service.  \n70.  He completed boot camp at Parris Island, South Carolina, and Motor Vehicle \nOperations School at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina. He then deployed to Vietnam.  \n71.  Mr. Monk arrived in Vietnam on July 20, 1969. Moments after he touched ground \nin Da Nang, while still disembarking from the airplane, Mr. Monk and the men with whom he \narrived were barraged by enemy forces firing mortar rounds into the base. Mr. Monk felt \ndefenseless against the attack, as neither he nor any of the men on their first deployment had \nbeen issued weapons yet.  \n72.  The next morning, Mr. Monk was driven through an area under enemy fire to \nmeet his unit in Quang Tri. Quang Tri was one of the most contested areas in south Vietnam, and \nAmerican troops there regularly engaged in heavy ground fighting. \n73.  As a motor vehicle operator, Mr. Monk was responsible for transporting troops \n  13 \n\nCase 3:22-cv-01503-JBA   Document 1   Filed 11/28/22   Page 14 of 27\n \nand equipment. He also performed interior and perimeter guard duty.  \n74.  Because Quang Tri was located less than 20 kilometers from the Demilitarized \nZone (DMZ), Mr. Monk regularly drove into the DMZ, where fighting was heavy. Mr. Monkโs \nconvoys were frequently attacked. Indeed, his convoy truck had bullet holes throughout it. Mr. \nMonk saw daily reminders that death could come at any time. As he drove through the combat \nzone, he passed the bodies of fallen Viet Cong fighters on the side of the road.  \n75.  One of his most gruesome memories arises from witnessing a fellow Marine drive \nover a Vietnamese man who had jumped in front of their vehicle without warning. Unsure of \nwhether the man was going to attack, the driver ran the man over, right before Mr. Monkโs eyes. \nMemories of the grisly death and the uncertainty of whether his comrade had been right to run \nover the Vietnamese man haunt Mr. Monk to this day. \n76.  Despite the intensity of the violence, Mr. Monk performed his duties faithfully. \nHe ultimately received a Rifle Marksman Badge, a National Defense Service Medal, a Vietnam \nService Medal with one star, and a Vietnam Combat Medal with Device. \n77.  In November 1969, Mr. Monkโs unit was pulled out of Vietnam. He was \ntransferred to the 3rd Battalion of the 3rd Marine Division, temporarily stationed in Okinawa, \nJapan.  \n78.  Mr. Monk began to fully experience the onset of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder \n(PTSD) in Okinawa. He was in a constant state of fear and hypervigilance. Mr. Monkโs PTSD \nled to two altercations in Okinawa that resulted in him spending time in base prison. Mr. Monk \nwas told that he would stay in base prison until he signed papers agreeing to an Undesirable \ndischarge and waiving his right to a court-martial.  \n79.  Mr. Monk did not understand that by accepting an Undesirable discharge, he \n  14 \n\nCase 3:22-cv-01503-JBA   Document 1   Filed 11/28/22   Page 15 of 27\n \nwould not only forfeit his eligibility for medical care and other financial support and benefits for \nveterans, but also face a lifetime of stigma. Depressed and symptomatic with PTSD, Mr. Monk \nsigned the discharge papers.  \n80.  Mr. Monk was discharged on September 15, 1970. He received an Undesirable \ndischarge (now known as a discharge โUnder Other than Honorableโ conditions). \nMr. Monkโs Return Home and Service to Veterans \n81.  Upon his return home, Mr. Monkโs condition worsened. He reacted instinctively \nto loud sounds, conflating them with blasts from Vietnam. Whenever he went into a restaurant or \nwas near a window, Mr. Monk would put his back up against the wall to feel safe. Over time, he \nresorted to self-medication to cope with his symptoms and developed an addiction to drugs. \n82.  In the early 1970s, Mr. Monk consulted a psychiatrist for help with his substance \nuse and mental health. However, as the American Psychiatric Associationโs Diagnostic and \nStatistical Manual did not recognize PTSD as a medical condition until 1980, there was little \nunderstanding of PTSD at the time. As a result, Mr. Monkโs PTSD went untreated and \nundiagnosed for years.  \n83.  Faced with his familyโs disappointment and dismay, Mr. Monk resolved to get \nclean from his drug addiction. He enrolled in the Connecticut Mental Health Center substance \nuse program and ended his addiction. While in the program, Mr. Monk noticed that many of the \nmen seeking treatment were veterans facing special challenges that the program was not able to \naddress. Mr. Monk wanted to help these men whose experiences he recognized in himself.  \n84.  Following his treatment, Mr. Monk became an addiction counselor certified by \nthe Addiction Prevention Treatment Foundation. He later joined the Yale Department of \nPsychology where he worked for four years, first as a drug counselor and later as a senior \n  15 \n\nCase 3:22-cv-01503-JBA   Document 1   Filed 11/28/22   Page 16 of 27\n \nrehabilitation counselor. \n85.  Informed by his own experiences and time working with Vietnam veterans, Mr. \nMonk started a group called โThe Undesirablesโ to help veterans with Other than Honorable \ndischarges apply for discharge upgrades and medical benefits. Mr. Monk built the organization \nfrom the ground up, using books at the public library to teach himself how to write the bylaws, \nand recruiting pro bono lawyers and accountants. \n86.  The group later changed its name to the National Veterans Council for Legal \nRedress. Today, NVCLR is a Connecticut-based non-profit veterans service organization that \nengages in advocacy and public education to promote the respect and acceptance of all who \nserved our country and works to secure benefits for veterans and their families. Mr. Monk \ncontinues to serve as the Director of NVCLR. \nD.  VA Repeatedly Denies Mr. Monk Benefits  \n87.  Soon after Mr. Monk left the U.S. Marine Corps, he applied for unemployment \ncompensation in Connecticut. The state unemployment agency sought information from the \nVeteransโ Administration regarding Mr. Monkโs eligibility.  \n88.  The VA conducted a COD determination and, in a March 1971 administrative \ndecision, found that Mr. Monk was โdischarged under dishonorable conditions and is not \ntherefore entitled to any benefits administered by the Veteransโ Administration.โ As a result, Mr. \nMonk was denied unemployment compensation in Connecticut. Mr. Monk requested the VA \nreconsider its decision, but VA refused to do so in May 1971. \n89.  The VAโs 1971 COD determination was flawed because it relied exclusively on a \nfinding that Mr. Monk voluntarily signed his discharge papers, and it was not based on all of the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding the incidents that led to Mr. Monkโs discharge, as required \n  16 \n\nCase 3:22-cv-01503-JBA   Document 1   Filed 11/28/22   Page 17 of 27\n \nby law. The agencyโs failure to conduct a meaningful COD determination, and its stubborn \nrefusal to reconsider that initial conclusion negatively impacted Mr. Monk for decades. \n90.  In 1976, Mr. Monk applied for VA education benefits in connection with his \nenrollment in a degree program at the University of New Haven. At the time, Mr. Monk and his \npartner were raising his two young daughters, and Mr. Monk had enrolled at University of New \nHaven to better his life and opportunities for his young family.  \n91.  In a decision dated April 12, 1976, VA denied Mr. Monkโs application for \neducation benefits based on his discharge status. VA relied exclusively on the flawed 1971 COD \ndetermination and failed to make a new COD determination in connection with this application \nfor educational assistance. \n92.  After VA denied his benefits application, Mr. Monk continued his education but \nhad to pay out-of-pocket while also working two jobs. However, in 1979, just three and a half \ncredits short of completion, Mr. Monk was forced to give up his studies because of the financial \nstrain on his family. He was never able to complete his education or obtain his degree, which \nimpaired his ability to support his family and achieve financial stability in his household.  \n93.  In 1982, upon learning about the newly-defined medical condition of PTSD, Mr. \nMonk recognized the symptoms in himself and applied to VA for disability compensation \nbenefits for PTSD.  \n94.  However, VA denied his application, continuing to rely on the flawed 1971 COD \ndetermination and declining to make a new COD determination. VAโs decision left Mr. Monk \nfeeling hopeless and as if the military had abandoned him despite his years of dedicated service.  \n95.  In 1983, now a father of four, Mr. Monk applied for VA home loan benefits. Mr. \nMonk and his partner were excited to move their family into a nice home in West Haven, \n  17 \n\nCase 3:22-cv-01503-JBA   Document 1   Filed 11/28/22   Page 18 of 27\n \nConnecticut. Despite his previous denials, Mr. Monk hoped that VA would look favorably on \nhim given his continued service to veterans. He also knew of other veterans with Other than \nHonorable discharges who were receiving VA benefits.  \n96.  Nevertheless, VA concluded that Mr. Monk was ineligible for VA home loan \nguaranty benefits. VA relied on the flawed 1971 COD determination and, again, failed to make a \nnew COD determination.  \n97.  After VA denied Mr. Monkโs home loan application, Mr. Monk spent months \napplying to other financial institutions to secure a home loan. He was homeless for a period of \ntime because of his inability to pay for housing. Although Mr. Monk eventually succeeded in \nsecuring a home loan, the delay harmed him and his family as they lost the economic and social \nbenefits associated with homeownership.  \n98.  Feeling abandoned by VA and the military, Mr. Monk stopped applying for \nbenefits for over two decades. He believed VAโs benefits system to be plagued by racial bias and \nfeared that he would never receive help from the country he had faithfully served. \n99.  In 2007, Mr. Monk suffered a severe stroke as the result of his undiagnosed \ndiabetes. The stroke left him unable to read, write, or walk for months. Soon thereafter, Mr. \nMonk was diagnosed with type II diabetes mellitus as a result of his exposure to Agent Orange in \nVietnam. Due to his financial constraints, Mr. Monkโs physician treated him with free \nmedication samples that he otherwise could not afford. Mr. Monkโs wife and oldest daughter \nhelped him pay for his medical care. \n100.  In 2010, hoping for additional assistance, Mr. Monk again applied for VA \ndisability compensation, this time for his type II diabetes mellitus.  \n  18 \n\nCase 3:22-cv-01503-JBA   Document 1   Filed 11/28/22   Page 19 of 27\n \n101.  As the 2021 statistical evidence establishes, VA was significantly more likely to \ndeny the application of Mr. Monk, a Black veteran, than that of a white veteran. And indeed, in a \ndecision dated December 8, 2010, VA rejected his application, relying again on the flawed 1971 \nCOD determination and failing to make a new COD determination. VA also reminded Mr. Monk \nthat it had previously denied his 1976 and 1982 applications for assistance.  \n102.  VAโs denial reaffirmed Mr. Monkโs disillusion and feelings of hopelessness. It \nalso compounded the financial stress on his family as they continued to pay for Mr. Monkโs \nmedical care. \n103.  In September 2011, Mr. Monk asked the Veterans Legal Services Clinic at Yale \nLaw School for assistance in seeking a discharge upgrade and VA benefits. The Clinic referred \nMr. Monk to a psychiatrist for evaluation. Over a total of four hours, Mr. Monk retold the \npsychiatrist the traumatic events that caused his PTSD. He relived the worst experiences of his \nlife, over and over again, to support his re-application for disability compensation.  \n104.  The psychiatrist concluded Mr. Monk had a severe case of PTSD, which arose \nfrom his military service in Vietnam.   \n105.  In February 2012, this time represented by the Clinic, Mr. Monk applied again for \ndisability compensation for PTSD, diabetes, and diabetic peripheral neuropathy in his arms and \nlegs. As the 2021 statistical analysis indicated, VA was more likely to deny Mr. Monkโs 2012 \napplication than that of a white veteran. And VA did so again, still relying on his discharge status \nand the flawed 1971 COD determination. VA did not conduct a new COD determination.  \n106.  Mr. Monk appealed. In September 2015, after Mr. Monk had obtained an upgrade \nof his discharge status through a separate application to the Board for Correction of Naval \n  19 \n\nCase 3:22-cv-01503-JBA   Document 1   Filed 11/28/22   Page 20 of 27\n \nRecords and litigation in U.S. district court, VA granted Mr. Monkโs disability compensation for \nPTSD with a 100% rating, as well as for diabetes and associated peripheral neuropathy.  \n107.  When VA finally granted Mr. Monk benefits, it erroneously assigned his claim an \nโeffective dateโ based solely on his discharge upgrade. VA refused to consider whether he was \neligible any earlier, as it continued to rely on its flawed and cursory 1971 COD determination. \nThis VA mistake cost Mr. Monk thousands of dollars in retroactive benefits. \n108.  Mr. Monk appealed again. The U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims held \nthat VA had erred in refusing to consider his eligibility for benefits before the date of his \ndischarge upgrade. Monk v. Wilkie, 2020 WL 2461722 (Vet. App. May 13, 2020).  \n109.  On remand, the Board of Veterans Appeals agreed, at long last, that even before it \nwas upgraded, โhis discharge . . . was not a bar to benefits.โ In re Monk, 2020 WL 8912950, at \n*1 (Bd. Vet. App. Dec. 15, 2020) (emphasis added) (granting disability compensation beginning \nFebruary 2012). This decision effectively overturned VAโs cursory 1971 COD determination that \nhad wrongly barred Mr. Monk from vital benefits and services for decades. Id. \n110.  VAโs decision granting disability compensation changed Mr. Monkโs life. For the \nfirst time, he felt truly recognized by VA for his service. He no longer felt beneath veterans who \nreceived benefits from VA. And most importantly, he could now provide for his family, his \nchurch, and his community in ways that he previously could not.  \nE.  VAโs Negligent Administration of Benefits Harmed Mr. Monk  \n111.  VAโs belated acknowledgement that Mr. Monk was eligible for benefits and \nservices even in the period before his discharge status was upgaded did not, however, make him \nwhole. Mr. Monk was and continues to be a victim of VAโs negligent administration of housing, \neducation, and disability benefits. \n  20 \n\nCase 3:22-cv-01503-JBA   Document 1   Filed 11/28/22   Page 21 of 27\n \n112.  VAโs negligence caused Mr. Monk to be denied veteransโ benefits to which he \nwas entitled. \n113.  VAโs negligence harmed Mr. Monk and his family both financially and \nemotionally.  \n114.  Each time Mr. Monk applied for VA benefits, he submitted extensive supporting \ndocumentation, filled out various VA forms, and interacted with VA officials.  \n115.  In the case of his third disability compensation application in 2012, Mr. Monk \nalso underwent psychiatric evaluations. Through painstaking detail, Mr. Monk relived and retold \nhis trauma to numerous individuals โ including doctors, his counsel, and character references โ \nto prove his eligibility for disability compensation.  \n116.  Mr. Monk also endured the emotional trauma of applying for VA benefits \nrepeatedly when VA initially denied his 2012 application, forcing him to navigate the appeal \nsystem and litigate two federal lawsuits to secure his benefits.  \n117.  The entire process exacerbated Mr. Monkโs PTSD and caused significant \nemotional distress.  \n118.  Upon returning home from his military service, Mr. Monk also suffered the severe \nreputational and dignitary harms associated with his benefit denials. The veteransโ community \nthat once embraced Mr. Monk as a son of a World War II veteran now looked down upon him. \nThe shame and stigma associated with his benefit denials caused Mr. Monk to feel like an \noutsider and a failure. He suffered significant emotional, dignitary, and reputational harm \nbecause of VAโs actions.  \n119.  Mr. Monk also suffered harm stemming from his perception of racial \ndiscrimination within the VA benefits system. He experienced this discrimination as an affront to \n  21 \n\nCase 3:22-cv-01503-JBA   Document 1   Filed 11/28/22   Page 22 of 27\n \nhis dignity, and it caused him emotional distress.  \n120.  Not only did Mr. Monk suffer significant emotional distress because of VAโs \nnegligent administration of benefits, but he also lost hundreds of thousands of dollars in \neducational, housing, and health care benefits.  \n121.  VAโs denial of education benefits forced Mr. Monk to leave the University of \nNew Haven before he could obtain his degree. Without the financial means to pay for college, he \nlost both the opportunity to complete his associateโs degree as well as the earning potential \nassociated with the degree. He and his family were thus deprived of the lifetime income and \nfinancial stability that a college degree would have provided. \n122.  After VA denied Mr. Monkโs home loan application, Mr. Monk spent months \napplying to other financial institutions to secure a home loan. He was homeless for a period of \ntime because of his inability to pay for housing. Although Mr. Monk eventually succeeded in \nsecuring a private home loan years later, the delay impacted him and his family as they lost the \neconomic and social benefits associated with homeownership.  \n123.  Finally, and most prominently, Mr. Monk and his family struggled to pay the \ncosts of his health care. For years, Mr. Monkโs family was forced to pay for medication and \ntreatments that would have been covered by VA had the agency granted his 1982 and 2010 \napplications. \n124.  VA eventually provided some benefits to Mr. Monk but only after years of delay \nand traumatization. However, the benefits he has received are inadequate, and not designed to \ncontemplate, the unique harm Mr. Monk suffered due to VAโs pattern of racial discrimination \nand the disparate impact on Black veterans. The indignity of racial discrimination is a distinct \ninjury, and this suit seeks redress for this harm VA caused to Mr. Monk.  \n  22 \n\nCase 3:22-cv-01503-JBA   Document 1   Filed 11/28/22   Page 23 of 27\n \nF.  Mr. Monk Timely Files This Complaint \n125.  Mr. Monk spent decades trying to obtain his rightfully owed benefits through \nVAโs administrative channels, but he was unaware of the pervasive and systematic racial bias \naffecting his eligibility for veteransโ benefits until VA disclosed long-withheld records to \nNVCLR in 2021, and those records were analyzed. \n126.  However, as evidenced by the data analysis discussed above, Mr. Monk now \nknows that he is one of thousands of Black veterans treated in a discriminatory manner by VA \nand subject to the racially disparate impact of VAโs operation of its benefits programs.  \n127.  While there was speculation for years that racial disparities existed in VAโs \nbenefits system, there was no data available to substantiate these claims prior to September 2021, \nwhen Mr. Monk, NVCLR, and BVP received the statistical analysis of the data from their FOIA \nrequests. There had been some publicly available reporting on the issue, but the full extent of the \nharm was not known until after this data was analyzed.  \n128.  Mr. Monk did not know, and had no way of knowing, about the racial disparities \nin VAโs administration of benefits until the records were disclosed and analyzed in 2021.  \n129.  Having discovered VAโs tortious conduct in September 2021, Mr. Monk \nsubmitted an administrative claim under the Federal Tort Claims Act in February 2022 and now \ntimely files this Complaint. He seeks not to relitigate his flawed 1971 COD determination and \nspecific benefits denials, but rather to hold VA accountable for its illegal, tortious, and racially \ndiscriminatory administration of benefits.  \nG.  Mr. Monk has Exhausted his Administrative Remedies Under the Federal \nTort Claims Act \n130.  The United States is liable pursuant to the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) for \nthe tortious acts of its employees in โcircumstances where the United States, if a private person, \n  23 \n\nCase 3:22-cv-01503-JBA   Document 1   Filed 11/28/22   Page 24 of 27\n \nwould be liable to the claimant in accordance with the law of the place where the act or omission \noccurred.โ 28 U.S.C. ยง 1346(b). \n131.  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 2675(a), a claimant must tender an administrative claim \nto the federal government before filing suit under the FTCA. An agencyโs failure to make a final \ndisposition of a claim within six months after it is filed โshall, at the option of the claimant any \ntime thereafter, be deemed a final denial of the claim.โ 28 U.S.C. ยง 2675(a).  \n132.  At all times relevant to this Complaint, VA officials acted within the scope of \ntheir employment and/or their official duties as employees of VA, an agency of the federal \ngovernment. \n133.  On February 25, 2022, Mr. Monk filed an FTCA administrative claim with VA \nfor the tortious actions alleged here and committed by VA leadership and officials acting under \nthe supervision of VA Administrators and, subsequently, VA Secretaries. \n134.  As of the filing of this Complaint, VA has not responded to Mr. Monkโs FTCA \nclaim. VAโs failure to dispose of Mr. Monkโs FTCA claim within six months of filing constitutes \na final denial. See 28 U.S.C. ยง 2675(a).  \n135.  Mr. Monk has administratively exhausted his claim under the FTCA. \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nFIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF  \n28 U.S.C. ยง 1346(b) โ Federal Tort Claims Act โ Negligence \n \n136.  Mr. Monk repeats and incorporates by reference each and every allegation \ncontained in the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.  \n137.  Under Connecticut law, negligence requires a showing of: (1) a duty of care to the \nplaintiff; (2) a breach of that duty; (3) proximate causation; and (4) damage to the plaintiff. \nLawrence v. O & G Indus., 126 A.3d 569, 574 (Conn. 2015). \n  24 \n\nCase 3:22-cv-01503-JBA   Document 1   Filed 11/28/22   Page 25 of 27\n \n138.  Federal law imposes a duty of care on the VA Secretary to administer veteransโ \nbenefits in a non-discriminatory manner. 38 U.S.C. ยง 303 (2018); 38 U.S.C. ยง 210(b) (1958). \n139.  VA Administrators and Secretaries, and other senior officials, breached this duty \nwhen through training, supervision, auditing, record-keeping, and other measures, they failed to \nredress longstanding, pervasive race discrimination and disparate impacts of which they knew or \nshould have known. \n140.  Due to this benefits obstruction, Mr. Monk was denied hundreds of thousands of \ndollarsโ worth of education, housing, and disability compensation. He also suffered significant \nemotional, psychological, and dignitary harm. \nSECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n28 U.S.C. ยง 1346(b) โ FTCA โ Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress \n \n141.  Mr. Monk repeats and incorporates by reference each and every allegation \ncontained in the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n142.  In Connecticut, a defendant engages in the tort of negligent infliction of emotional \ndistress when: (1) the defendantโs conduct created an unreasonable risk of causing the plaintiff \nemotional distress; (2) the plaintiffโs distress was foreseeable; (3) the emotional distress was \nsevere enough that it might result in illness or bodily harm; and (4) the defendantโs conduct was \nthe cause of the plaintiffโs distress. Carrol v. Allstate Ins. Co., 815 A.2d 119, 127 (Conn. 2003). \n143.  For over four decades, VA employees repeatedly denied Mr. Monkโs requests for \nVA education, housing, and disability compensation benefits. He endured numerous \npsychological and physical evaluations to apply for VA benefits.   \n144.  The failure of VA officials and employees to maintain a racially neutral system of \nadministering benefits led to a higher likelihood that he would be denied benefits, thus creating a \nrisk of psychological harm. \n  25 \n\nCase 3:22-cv-01503-JBA   Document 1   Filed 11/28/22   Page 26 of 27\n \n145.  It was foreseeable that Mr. Monk would experience emotional distress from \nhaving to relitigate his claims and navigate the VA benefits process over and over again.   \n146.  VA officials caused Mr. Monk to be so severely emotionally distressed that it \nmight result in illness or bodily harm. \n147.  As a result of the actions of VA officials and employees, Mr. Monk suffered \nsevere emotional distress, including exacerbation of his PTSD.  \nTHIRD CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n28 U.S.C. ยง 1346(b) โ FTCA โ Negligent Supervision \n \n148.  Mr. Monk repeats and incorporates by reference each and every allegation \ncontained in the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n149.  In Connecticut, negligent supervision occurs when: (1) the plaintiff suffers an \ninjury due to the defendantโs failure to supervise an employee; and (2) the defendant had a duty \nto supervise the employee. Roberts v. Circuit-Wise, Inc., 142 F. Supp. 2d 211, 213 (D. Conn. \n2001). The defendant has a duty of care where the defendant โknew or reasonably should have \nknown of the employeeโs propensity to engage in that type of tortious conduct.โ Id.  \n150.  VA officials and employees failed to instruct VA staff on how to distribute \nbenefits in a racially neutral way. Leadership failed to create a system in which data related to \nbenefits decisions could be aggregated and potential bias could be identified. Mr. Monk thus had \nto file his claims in a system that was racially discriminatory, lowering his chances of receiving \nthe benefits he deserved. \n151.  VA officials and employees knew or should have known about these failures but \nfailed to rectify them.   \n152.  VA leadershipโs negligent supervision of VA managers and adjudicators violated \ntheir statutory duty to ensure the proper execution of VA laws.  \n  26 \n\nCase 3:22-cv-01503-JBA   Document 1   Filed 11/28/22   Page 27 of 27\n \nREQUEST FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court grant the following relief: \n(1) Award Plaintiff compensatory damages in an amount to be determined at trial; \n(2) Require Defendant to pay Plaintiffโs reasonable fees, costs, and expenses, including \nattorneysโ fees, pursuant to the Equal Access to Justice Act, 28 U.S.C. ยง 2412(b); and \n(3) Grant such other relief as the Court deems just and equitable.  \nDated: November 28, 2022 \n  New Haven, Connecticut \n \nRespectfully Submitted, \n \nBy: /s/ Jason Parkin                             \nMichelle Fraling, Law Student Intern*1 \nRebecca Harris, Law Student Intern* \nAdam Henderson, Law Student Intern* \nBeatrice Pollard, Law Student Intern* \nMichael Sullivan, Law Student Intern* \nJason Parkin, ct28499 \nMichael J.

      "text": "Case 3:22-cv-01503-JBA   Document 1   Filed 11/28/22   Page 1 of 27\n \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF CONNECTICUT  \n  \n     \nCONLEY F. MONK JR.,     \n     \nPlaintiff,     \n   Civil Action No. 3:22-cv-1503 \nv.     \n     \nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA,   November 28, 2022  \n     \nDefendant.     \n     \n \nCOMPLAINT \n1.  The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and its predecessor, the Veteransโ \nAdministration (collectively โVAโ), have operated generous programs of education, housing, \ndisability compensation, and other benefits since World War II. For decades, there have been \nanecedotal reports and widespread suspicion of racial discrimination in these programs. \n2.  In 2021, in response to Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) litigation, VA \ndisclosed records confirming these long-held suspicions for the first time. Analysis of these \nrecords reveals a statistically significant difference in VA disability compensation claim \ndeterminations based on race from 2001 to 2020, the period for which VA disclosed data. Each \nyear, VA was more likely to reject applications of Black veterans than of white veterans. \n3.  The result of VAโs racial discrimination has been to deny countless meritorious \napplications by Black veterans, depriving them and their families of care and support that their \nfaithful service had earned. \n4.  Plaintiff Conley Monk Jr. is one of these veterans. Mr. Monk comes from a \nfamily of Black service members; his father was in a segregated U.S. Army unit during World \nWar II and fought at Normandy, and a number of his siblings served in the armed forces. Mr. \n\nCase 3:22-cv-01503-JBA   Document 1   Filed 11/28/22   Page 2 of 27\n \nMonk himself joined the U.S. Marine Corps after high school and served in combat in Vietnam, \nwhere he was promoted to lance corporal and also seriously wounded.  \n5.  For nearly fifty years after he returned home to Connecticut in 1970, the VA \nimproperly denied Mr. Monkโs applications for education, housing, and disability benefits. Mr. \nMonk suspected racial bias at the VA but had no way to prove it. \n6.  VA eventually granted Mr. Monk benefits in 2015 and again in 2020, confirming \nthat he was disabled by wounds suffered during his military service and eligible for disability \ncompensation. But VA has never fully compensated him for the harm it caused by repeatedly \ndenying his benefits appplications.  \n7.  Last year, for the first time, Mr. Monk learned of concrete evidence of persistent \nracial disparities in VA benefits programs, namely the 2021 statistical analysis described above. \nThis analysis was based on records that VA disclosed in FOIA litigation brought by Mr. Monkโs \norganization, the National Veterans Council for Legal Redress, and the Black Veterans Project.  \n8.  In early 2022 Mr. Monk filed an administrative claim with the VA. He alleged \nthat because VA leaders knew or should have known of pervasive racial disparities in the award \nof VA benefits, and because they nevertheless failed to address these disparities, VA leadership \nnegligently breached its statutory duty of care under 38 U.S.C. ยง 303 (2018) and 38 U.S.C. \nยง 210(b) (1958). VA has not responded to Mr. Monkโs administrative claim.  \n9.  Mr. Monk is not seeking to relitigate his individual benefits requests. Instead, he \nseeks to recover for the harm caused to him by VA leadersโ negligent failure to redress the \nlongstanding racial disparities in veteransโ benefits administration, about which leadership has \nknown or should have known for decades. \n10.  VAโs tortious conduct caused Mr. Monk to suffer periods of housing insecurity, \n  2 \n\nCase 3:22-cv-01503-JBA   Document 1   Filed 11/28/22   Page 3 of 27\n \nfinancial hardship, and difficulty accessing proper medical care. He suffered severe emotional \nharm when he was forced to repeatedly relive the most traumatic moments of his life as part of \nhis applications and re-applications for disability compensation. And he suffered dignitary and \nreputational harm as a result of VAโs discriminatory actions.  \n11.  Having exhausted his administrative remedies, Mr. Monk brings this action \npursuant to the Federal Tort Claims Act. He asserts claims for negligence, negligent infliction of \nemotional distress, and negligent supervision, and seeks thereby to redress the harms caused to \nhim by the failure of VA leaders and staff to administer their benefits programs in a manner free \nfrom racial discrimination against Black veterans. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n12.  This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยงยง 1331 and 1346(b). \n13.  Venue is proper under 28 U.S.C. ยงยง 1402(b) and 1391(e)(1) because Plaintiff \nresides in the District of Connecticut, a substantial part of the events, acts, or omissions giving \nrise to the claims occurred in this District, and no real property is involved in this action.  \nPARTIES \n14.  Plaintiff Conley F. Monk Jr. is a 74-year-old resident of New Haven, Connecticut. \nHe is a veteran of the U.S. Marine Corps, served with distinction in the Vietnam War, and \ncontinues to advocate for veterans as the co-founder and Director of the National Veterans \nCouncil for Legal Redress (NVCLR).   \n15.  Defendant United States of America is sued under the Federal Tort Claims Act \n(FTCA) for the tortious acts of its employees, including employees of the Department of \nVeterans Affairs and its predecessor agency, the Veteransโ Administration.  \n   \n  3 \n\nCase 3:22-cv-01503-JBA   Document 1   Filed 11/28/22   Page 4 of 27\n \nLEGAL FRAMEWORK \n16.  The United States Government has provided assistance for individuals who served \nin the nationโs armed forces since 1776, when the Continental Congress established disability \npensions for veterans โ the predecessor to todayโs disability compensation program.  \n17.  In 1944, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the Servicemenโs Readjustment \nAct of 1944 (โG.I. Billโ) providing, among other things, sweeping education and home loan \nbenefits to World War II veterans.  \n18.  At the signing ceremony, President Roosevelt remarked that the G.I. Bill and \nearlier legislation โprovide the special benefits which are due to the members of our armed \nforcesโfor they have been compelled to make greater economic sacrifice and every other kind \nof sacrifice than the rest of us, and are entitled to definite action to help take care of their special \nproblems.โ  \nEducation Benefits \n19.  The G.I. Billโs education benefits were intended to give servicemembers the \nopportunity to resume their education or technical training after their discharge from the military. \nUnder the original legislation, eligible veterans who enrolled in a qualifying educational program \nโ including undergraduate and professional schools, vocational schools, apprenticeships, and \nscientific and technical institutions, among others โ could receive monetary assistance for tuition, \nbooks, supplies, and other necessary expenses from VA to complete their education.  \n20.  After the original G.I. Bill expired in 1956, Congress continued to fund and \nexpand education benefits for veterans.   \n21.  In 1976, when Mr. Monk applied for VA education benefits, eligible veterans \ncould receive a monthly cash benefit (based on their number of dependents) to cover educational \n  4 \n\nCase 3:22-cv-01503-JBA   Document 1   Filed 11/28/22   Page 5 of 27\n \ncosts and a loan from VA (based on the governmentโs determination of financial need) to cover \nthe cost of tuition.  \n22.  Approximately 20 million veterans have benefited from the education benefits \nprogram initially established by the G.I. Bill. The program has enabled veterans to pursue \nuniversity courses, certificate programs, on-the-job training, apprenticeship training, flight \ntraining, and non-college degree courses.  \nHome Loan Benefits \n23.  Like VA education benefits, the VA home loan program was created by the \noriginal G.I. Bill in 1944. The program was designed to help veterans purchase and retain their \nhomes through government-guaranteed loans.   \n24.  Under the original VA home loan program, veterans could apply for home loan \nguarantees from VA of up to 50 percent of the loan amount, not to exceed $2,000. Since 1944, \nCongress has amended the program to increase the guaranty to up to $45,000.  \n25.  In 1983, at the time Mr. Monk applied for a home loan guaranty from VA, \nveterans could receive a guaranty of up to $27,500.  \n26.  As of October 2020, VA has guaranteed more than 25 million home loans.  \nDisability Compensation \n27.  The VA disability compensation program provides support for veterans who were \ninjured during their military service or whose condition worsened as a result of their service.  \n28.  Current VA disability compensation provides a monthly tax-free cash benefit to \nveterans with disabilities that are the result of a disease or injury incurred or aggravated during \nactive military service. Depending on the degree of disability and number of dependents, a \nveteran may receive more than $4,000 in monthly cash benefits.   \n  5 \n\nCase 3:22-cv-01503-JBA   Document 1   Filed 11/28/22   Page 6 of 27\n \n29.  The amount of disability compensation that Mr. Monk could have received when \nhe first applied in 1982 is uncertain based on publicly available information. In 2010, the second \ntime Mr. Monk applied for disability compensation, a veteran with a spouse could earn up to \n$2,823 per month in benefits from VA. In 2012, the last time Mr. Monk applied for disability \ncompensation, a veteran with a spouse could earn up to $2,973 per month in benefits from VA. \n30.  In fiscal year 2021, VA provided over $112 billion in disability compensation to \napproximately 5.6 million veterans and their families.  \nEligibility for Education, Housing, and Disability Benefits \n31.  In addition to eligibility criteria specific to each VA benefits program, individuals \nare eligible for education, housing, and disability benefits only if they are considered a โveteranโ \nunder 38 U.S.C. ยง 101(2). The statute defines veterans as those individuals who were discharged \nfrom the military โunder conditions other than dishonorable.โ Id. \n32.  Individuals who receive an Honorable, General under Honorable, or \nUncharacterized discharge are generally eligible for these VA benefits, unless a statutory bar \napplies. See 38 U.S.C. ยง 5303; 38 C.F.R. ยง 3.12. \n33.  Individuals who receive a Dishonorable discharge are not considered veterans and \nare ineligible for these VA benefits. 38 U.S.C. ยง 101(2).  \n34.  Individuals who receive an Other than Honorable (previously โUndesirableโ) or \nBad Conduct discharge may be eligible for VA benefits. When a person with such a discharge \napplies for benefits, VA must conduct a โcharacter of dischargeโ (COD) assessment to determine \nwhether such a discharge was โunder conditions other than dishonorable,โ taking into \nconsideration the personโs military records and any other evidence submitted. 38 C.F.R. ยง 3.12.  \n  6 \n\nCase 3:22-cv-01503-JBA   Document 1   Filed 11/28/22   Page 7 of 27\n \nVAโs Duty to Administer Education, Housing, and Disability Benefits \n35.  The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and its predecessor agency, the \nVeteransโ Administration, have been responsible for administering veteransโ education, housing, \nand disability benefits programs.  \n36.  On July 3, 1930, Congress established the Veteransโ Administration, headed by \nthe VA Administrator.  \n37.  Until 1957, federal law stated that the VA Administrator, โunder the direction of \nthe President, shall have the control, direction, and management of the various agencies and \nactivities [enumerated herein]โ concerning the โadministration of the laws relating to the relief \nand other benefits provided by lawโ for veterans. 38 U.S.C. ยง 11 (1934).  \n38.  In 1957, Congress amended the statute, providing that the โAdministrator . . . is \nresponsible for the proper execution and administration of all laws administered by the \nVeteransโ Administration and for the control, direction, and management of the Veteransโ \nAdministration.โ Veteransโ Benefits Act of 1957, Pub. L. No. 85-56, 71 Stat. 83, 91-92 (1957) \n(emphasis added); 38 U.S.C. ยง 210(b) (1958). \n39.  In October 1988, President Reagan elevated the Veteransโ Administration to a \nCabinet-level department. The Veteransโ Administration officially became the modern-day U.S. \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs on March 15, 1989.  \n40.  On August 6, 1991, Congress passed the Department of Veterans Affairs \nCodification Act, establishing the purpose and structure of the new Department. Congress \nimposed the same duty of care on the Secretary of Veterans Affairs as it did on the former VA \nAdministrator, providing that the VA Secretary is โresponsible for the proper execution and \nadministration of all laws administered by the Department and for the control, direction, and \n  7 \n\nCase 3:22-cv-01503-JBA   Document 1   Filed 11/28/22   Page 8 of 27\n \nmanagement of the Department.โ 38 U.S.C. ยง 303 (emphasis added). \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \nA.  VA Officials Breached Their Duty of Care by Administering Benefits in a \nRacially Discriminatory Manner \n \n41.  On February 22, 2021, Mr. Monkโs organization, NVCLR, along with the Black \nVeterans Project (BVP) filed Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests with three \ncomponents of VA. These FOIA requests sought information regarding the administration of \nservice-connected disability compensation, as that program is the largest veteransโ benefits \nprogram and serves the most veterans. The disability compensation program also directly harmed \nMr. Monk, as he was repeatedly denied benefits for years.  \n42.  VA provided responses to some, but not all, of these FOIA requests. Due to the \ninadequacy of VAโs response, NVCLR and BVP filed administrative appeals and, after VA \nfailed to respond fully and adequately, a complaint in U.S. district court. After months of \nlitigation, in 2021 VA conducted further searches and produced additional documents.  \n43.      The records disclosed by VA included claims outcomes for veterans from 2001 \nto 2020. The data did not cover previous years because, VA represented, it did not link ratings \ndecision data to specific files and did not fully retain disability decision data prior to 2001. \n44.  Through their counsel, NVCLR and BVP consulted a Yale University statistician \nto analyze the VA records.  \n45.  The analysis found a statistically significant difference in VA claim outcomes (the \nnumber of claims denied, partially granted, or granted) between: (1) Black veterans and white \nveterans; (2) Black male veterans and white male veterans; and (3) Black female veterans and \nwhite female veterans. \n  8 \n\nCase 3:22-cv-01503-JBA   Document 1   Filed 11/28/22   Page 9 of 27\n \n46.  VA denied Black veterans, Black male veterans, and Black female veterans \ndisability compensation at statistically higher rates than their white counterparts. For instance, \nbetween 2001 to 2020, the average denial rate for disability compensation was 29.5% for Black \nveterans and 24.2% for white veterans.  \n47.  In addition, the statisticianโs analysis found that the VAโs average grant rate for \ndisability compensation was 30.3% for Black veterans and 37.1% for white veterans. This is also \na statistically significant disparity.  \n48.  The data showed that from 2002 to 2020, a Black veteran applying for disability \ncompensation was more likely to be denied than a white veteran. This data is displayed below. \nPercentage of Disability Claims Denied\n35%\n30%\n25%\n20%\n15%\n10%\n5%\n0%\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2\n2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0\nWhite Veterans Black Veterans\n \n \n49.  On information and belief, additional records possessed by VA and not yet \npublicly disclosed further confirm racial disparities in the administration of VA benefits \nprograms since World War II and a disparate impact on Black veterans, of which VA leaders \nknew or should have known and negligently failed to redress. \n  9 \n\nCase 3:22-cv-01503-JBA   Document 1   Filed 11/28/22   Page 10 of 27\n \nB.  VA Knew or Should Have Known About Racial Discrepancies and Failed to \nRemedy Them  \n \n50.  VA officials violated their statutory obligation and duty of care to properly \nexecute and administer the law when they administered benefits in a manner they knew or should \nhave known resulted in racially disparate outcomes, and when VA leadership negligently failed \nto redress those pervasive racial disparities. \n51.  These officials included every VA Administrator or Secretary since World War II, \nfrom Frank Hines (VA Administrator until 1945) to Secretary Denis McDonough (VA Secretary \n2021-present), as well as each Under Secretary of Veterans Affairs for Benefits and other senior \nVA officials responsible for administering veteransโ benefits programs in the same period. \n52.  For example, the training, supervision, auditing, and record-keeping practices \nimplented by VA leaders caused a disparate impact on Black veterans applying for benefits as \ncompared to white veterans. \n53.  The records that NVCLR and BVP received from VA through their FOIA \nrequests demonstrate that for decades VA leadership, including VA Secretaries, knew or should \nhave known of pervasive, longstanding racial disparities in veteransโ benefits for Black veterans. \nAnd for decades, VA officials have negligently failed to redress these disparities. \n54.  VA officials also knew or should have known that racial bias in the military \njustice system was affecting the discharge status of Black veterans like Mr. Monk, who initially \nreceived an Undesirable (now, Other Than Honorable) discharge.  \n55.  The Defense Departmentโs own analysis shortly after Mr. Monkโs discharge \ndemonstrated that Black servicemembers were substantially more likely than white \nservicemembers to face military justice or disciplinary action. TASK FORCE ON THE ADMIN. OF \nMIL. JUST. IN THE ARMED FORCES, OFF. OF THE ASSISTANT SECโY OF DEF., REPORT OF THE TASK \n  10 \n\nCase 3:22-cv-01503-JBA   Document 1   Filed 11/28/22   Page 11 of 27\n \nFORCE ON THE ADMINISTRATION OF MILITARY JUSTICE IN THE ARMED FORCES VOL. I 32 (1972); \nsee also PETER G. NORDLIE ET AL., U.S. ARMY RESEARCH INSTITUTE FOR THE BEHAVIORAL AND \nSOCIAL SCIENCES, MEASURING CHANGES IN INSTITUTIONAL RACIAL DISCRIMINATION IN THE \nARMY 25 (1975) (finding โa strong relationship between skin color and type of dischargeโ). \n56.  More recent analyses have reached similar conclusions. DANIEL P. MACDONALD, \nET AL., DEFENSE EQUAL OPPORTUNITY MANAGEMENT INSTITUTE DIRECTORATE OF RESEARCH \nDEVELOPMENT AND STRATEGIC INITIATIVES, REPORT OF RACIAL DISPARITIES IN THE MILITARY \nJUSTICE SYSTEM 17 (2017) (finding that Black servicemembers were 36.6% and 50% more likely \nto face courts-martial and non-judicial punishments, respectively, than white servicemembers). \n57.  After the 1972 Defense Department Report, the U.S. Equal Employment \nOpportunity Commission (EEOC) concluded that military discharges were so tainted by race \ndiscrimination that an employer who required an honorable discharge as a condition of hiring \nviolated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, absent a business necessity. EEOC Decision \nNo. 74-25 (1973); see also EEOC Decision No. 76-13 (1975) (same, as to blanket refusal to hire \nor re-employ veteran with less-than-honorable discharge), overruled in part on other grounds by \nEEOC Decision No. 80-26 (1980); Dozier v. Chupka, 395 F. Supp. 836 (S.D. Ohio 1975) \n(holding municipal fire department disqualification of applicants with less-than-honorable \ndischarges has impermissible adverse impact based on race). \n58.  Because VA looks to veteransโ service records and discharge status in making \nCOD determinations, VA knew or should have known that bias in the military justice system \nwould likely lead to racial disparities in its COD determinations absent a concerted effort to \nidentify and correct for this effect. \n59.  VA leaders also knew or should have known that placing undue weight on the \n  11 \n\nCase 3:22-cv-01503-JBA   Document 1   Filed 11/28/22   Page 12 of 27\n \nostensibly voluntary nature of an Other than Honorable discharge contributes to racial disparities \nin COD determinations and has the same sort of impermissible disparate impact that the EEOC \ndetermined was unlawful in employment settings.  \n60.  VA failed to rectify these issues, resulting in COD determinations that were based \non racially disparate discharge statuses.  \n61.  The negligence of VA leadership, and their failure to train, supervise, monitor, \nand instruct agency officials to take steps to identify and correct racial disparities, led to \nsystematic benefits obstruction for Black veterans. \n62.  VA officials also negligently failed to collect and aggregate claims data prior to \n2001 in a manner that would have enabled VA to identify the nature and scope of these \ndisparities. Further, VA leaders failed to properly train, supervise, and instruct employees on \nprocedures and practices that would administer benefits in nondiscriminatory ways.  \n63.  VA acknowledged its record-keeping negligence in its FOIA responses, \nconceding that โrating decision data was never directly linked to the Pending Issue File or to the \nCPMR, limiting our ability to link outcomes to claims.โ In addition, disability decision data was \nnot fully retained by VA prior to 2001. VAโs negligence in maintaining a system that could not \ntrack and rectify racial discrepancies harmed thousands of Black veterans.  \n64.  VAโs negligence in failing to create and maintain a system to track claims and \nidentify racial disparities led the agency to fail to properly execute and administer the law, as \nrequired by statute. \nC.  Conley Monk Jr.โs Military Service and Service to Veterans \n65.  Conley Monk Jr. is a proud Black Vietnam War veteran who has been a leader, \nadvocate, and counselor to other veterans for more than 50 years. He is one of thousands of \n  12 \n\nCase 3:22-cv-01503-JBA   Document 1   Filed 11/28/22   Page 13 of 27\n \nBlack veterans harmed by VAโs tortious conduct. \n66.  Mr. Monk was born in Rocky Mount, North Carolina, in 1948 into the \naccomplished Monk family that includes the jazz musician Thelonius Monk, the Hall of Fame \nfootball player Art Monk, and generations of teachers, police officers, and public servants.  \n67.  Mr. Monkโs father, Conley Monk Sr., served in a segregated unit in the U.S. \nArmy during World War II and participated in the Normandy invasion.   \n68.  Mr. Monk moved with his family to Connecticut when he was very young. He \ngrew up and attended public schools in New Haven, and during high school he worked part-time \nat the VA Hospital in West Haven.  \nMr. Monkโs Military Service \n69.  On November 12, 1968, at 20 years old, Mr. Monk voluntarily enlisted in the U.S. \nMarine Corps and continued a long tradition of family service.  \n70.  He completed boot camp at Parris Island, South Carolina, and Motor Vehicle \nOperations School at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina. He then deployed to Vietnam.  \n71.  Mr. Monk arrived in Vietnam on July 20, 1969. Moments after he touched ground \nin Da Nang, while still disembarking from the airplane, Mr. Monk and the men with whom he \narrived were barraged by enemy forces firing mortar rounds into the base. Mr. Monk felt \ndefenseless against the attack, as neither he nor any of the men on their first deployment had \nbeen issued weapons yet.  \n72.  The next morning, Mr. Monk was driven through an area under enemy fire to \nmeet his unit in Quang Tri. Quang Tri was one of the most contested areas in south Vietnam, and \nAmerican troops there regularly engaged in heavy ground fighting. \n73.  As a motor vehicle operator, Mr. Monk was responsible for transporting troops \n  13 \n\nCase 3:22-cv-01503-JBA   Document 1   Filed 11/28/22   Page 14 of 27\n \nand equipment. He also performed interior and perimeter guard duty.  \n74.  Because Quang Tri was located less than 20 kilometers from the Demilitarized \nZone (DMZ), Mr. Monk regularly drove into the DMZ, where fighting was heavy. Mr. Monkโs \nconvoys were frequently attacked. Indeed, his convoy truck had bullet holes throughout it. Mr. \nMonk saw daily reminders that death could come at any time. As he drove through the combat \nzone, he passed the bodies of fallen Viet Cong fighters on the side of the road.  \n75.  One of his most gruesome memories arises from witnessing a fellow Marine drive \nover a Vietnamese man who had jumped in front of their vehicle without warning. Unsure of \nwhether the man was going to attack, the driver ran the man over, right before Mr. Monkโs eyes. \nMemories of the grisly death and the uncertainty of whether his comrade had been right to run \nover the Vietnamese man haunt Mr. Monk to this day. \n76.  Despite the intensity of the violence, Mr. Monk performed his duties faithfully. \nHe ultimately received a Rifle Marksman Badge, a National Defense Service Medal, a Vietnam \nService Medal with one star, and a Vietnam Combat Medal with Device. \n77.  In November 1969, Mr. Monkโs unit was pulled out of Vietnam. He was \ntransferred to the 3rd Battalion of the 3rd Marine Division, temporarily stationed in Okinawa, \nJapan.  \n78.  Mr. Monk began to fully experience the onset of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder \n(PTSD) in Okinawa. He was in a constant state of fear and hypervigilance. Mr. Monkโs PTSD \nled to two altercations in Okinawa that resulted in him spending time in base prison. Mr. Monk \nwas told that he would stay in base prison until he signed papers agreeing to an Undesirable \ndischarge and waiving his right to a court-martial.  \n79.  Mr. Monk did not understand that by accepting an Undesirable discharge, he \n  14 \n\nCase 3:22-cv-01503-JBA   Document 1   Filed 11/28/22   Page 15 of 27\n \nwould not only forfeit his eligibility for medical care and other financial support and benefits for \nveterans, but also face a lifetime of stigma. Depressed and symptomatic with PTSD, Mr. Monk \nsigned the discharge papers.  \n80.  Mr. Monk was discharged on September 15, 1970. He received an Undesirable \ndischarge (now known as a discharge โUnder Other than Honorableโ conditions). \nMr. Monkโs Return Home and Service to Veterans \n81.  Upon his return home, Mr. Monkโs condition worsened. He reacted instinctively \nto loud sounds, conflating them with blasts from Vietnam. Whenever he went into a restaurant or \nwas near a window, Mr. Monk would put his back up against the wall to feel safe. Over time, he \nresorted to self-medication to cope with his symptoms and developed an addiction to drugs. \n82.  In the early 1970s, Mr. Monk consulted a psychiatrist for help with his substance \nuse and mental health. However, as the American Psychiatric Associationโs Diagnostic and \nStatistical Manual did not recognize PTSD as a medical condition until 1980, there was little \nunderstanding of PTSD at the time. As a result, Mr. Monkโs PTSD went untreated and \nundiagnosed for years.  \n83.  Faced with his familyโs disappointment and dismay, Mr. Monk resolved to get \nclean from his drug addiction. He enrolled in the Connecticut Mental Health Center substance \nuse program and ended his addiction. While in the program, Mr. Monk noticed that many of the \nmen seeking treatment were veterans facing special challenges that the program was not able to \naddress. Mr. Monk wanted to help these men whose experiences he recognized in himself.  \n84.  Following his treatment, Mr. Monk became an addiction counselor certified by \nthe Addiction Prevention Treatment Foundation. He later joined the Yale Department of \nPsychology where he worked for four years, first as a drug counselor and later as a senior \n  15 \n\nCase 3:22-cv-01503-JBA   Document 1   Filed 11/28/22   Page 16 of 27\n \nrehabilitation counselor. \n85.  Informed by his own experiences and time working with Vietnam veterans, Mr. \nMonk started a group called โThe Undesirablesโ to help veterans with Other than Honorable \ndischarges apply for discharge upgrades and medical benefits. Mr. Monk built the organization \nfrom the ground up, using books at the public library to teach himself how to write the bylaws, \nand recruiting pro bono lawyers and accountants. \n86.  The group later changed its name to the National Veterans Council for Legal \nRedress. Today, NVCLR is a Connecticut-based non-profit veterans service organization that \nengages in advocacy and public education to promote the respect and acceptance of all who \nserved our country and works to secure benefits for veterans and their families. Mr. Monk \ncontinues to serve as the Director of NVCLR. \nD.  VA Repeatedly Denies Mr. Monk Benefits  \n87.  Soon after Mr. Monk left the U.S. Marine Corps, he applied for unemployment \ncompensation in Connecticut. The state unemployment agency sought information from the \nVeteransโ Administration regarding Mr. Monkโs eligibility.  \n88.  The VA conducted a COD determination and, in a March 1971 administrative \ndecision, found that Mr. Monk was โdischarged under dishonorable conditions and is not \ntherefore entitled to any benefits administered by the Veteransโ Administration.โ As a result, Mr. \nMonk was denied unemployment compensation in Connecticut. Mr. Monk requested the VA \nreconsider its decision, but VA refused to do so in May 1971. \n89.  The VAโs 1971 COD determination was flawed because it relied exclusively on a \nfinding that Mr. Monk voluntarily signed his discharge papers, and it was not based on all of the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding the incidents that led to Mr. Monkโs discharge, as required \n  16 \n\nCase 3:22-cv-01503-JBA   Document 1   Filed 11/28/22   Page 17 of 27\n \nby law. The agencyโs failure to conduct a meaningful COD determination, and its stubborn \nrefusal to reconsider that initial conclusion negatively impacted Mr. Monk for decades. \n90.  In 1976, Mr. Monk applied for VA education benefits in connection with his \nenrollment in a degree program at the University of New Haven. At the time, Mr. Monk and his \npartner were raising his two young daughters, and Mr. Monk had enrolled at University of New \nHaven to better his life and opportunities for his young family.  \n91.  In a decision dated April 12, 1976, VA denied Mr. Monkโs application for \neducation benefits based on his discharge status. VA relied exclusively on the flawed 1971 COD \ndetermination and failed to make a new COD determination in connection with this application \nfor educational assistance. \n92.  After VA denied his benefits application, Mr. Monk continued his education but \nhad to pay out-of-pocket while also working two jobs. However, in 1979, just three and a half \ncredits short of completion, Mr. Monk was forced to give up his studies because of the financial \nstrain on his family. He was never able to complete his education or obtain his degree, which \nimpaired his ability to support his family and achieve financial stability in his household.  \n93.  In 1982, upon learning about the newly-defined medical condition of PTSD, Mr. \nMonk recognized the symptoms in himself and applied to VA for disability compensation \nbenefits for PTSD.  \n94.  However, VA denied his application, continuing to rely on the flawed 1971 COD \ndetermination and declining to make a new COD determination. VAโs decision left Mr. Monk \nfeeling hopeless and as if the military had abandoned him despite his years of dedicated service.  \n95.  In 1983, now a father of four, Mr. Monk applied for VA home loan benefits. Mr. \nMonk and his partner were excited to move their family into a nice home in West Haven, \n  17 \n\nCase 3:22-cv-01503-JBA   Document 1   Filed 11/28/22   Page 18 of 27\n \nConnecticut. Despite his previous denials, Mr. Monk hoped that VA would look favorably on \nhim given his continued service to veterans. He also knew of other veterans with Other than \nHonorable discharges who were receiving VA benefits.  \n96.  Nevertheless, VA concluded that Mr. Monk was ineligible for VA home loan \nguaranty benefits. VA relied on the flawed 1971 COD determination and, again, failed to make a \nnew COD determination.  \n97.  After VA denied Mr. Monkโs home loan application, Mr. Monk spent months \napplying to other financial institutions to secure a home loan. He was homeless for a period of \ntime because of his inability to pay for housing. Although Mr. Monk eventually succeeded in \nsecuring a home loan, the delay harmed him and his family as they lost the economic and social \nbenefits associated with homeownership.  \n98.  Feeling abandoned by VA and the military, Mr. Monk stopped applying for \nbenefits for over two decades. He believed VAโs benefits system to be plagued by racial bias and \nfeared that he would never receive help from the country he had faithfully served. \n99.  In 2007, Mr. Monk suffered a severe stroke as the result of his undiagnosed \ndiabetes. The stroke left him unable to read, write, or walk for months. Soon thereafter, Mr. \nMonk was diagnosed with type II diabetes mellitus as a result of his exposure to Agent Orange in \nVietnam. Due to his financial constraints, Mr. Monkโs physician treated him with free \nmedication samples that he otherwise could not afford. Mr. Monkโs wife and oldest daughter \nhelped him pay for his medical care. \n100.  In 2010, hoping for additional assistance, Mr. Monk again applied for VA \ndisability compensation, this time for his type II diabetes mellitus.  \n  18 \n\nCase 3:22-cv-01503-JBA   Document 1   Filed 11/28/22   Page 19 of 27\n \n101.  As the 2021 statistical evidence establishes, VA was significantly more likely to \ndeny the application of Mr. Monk, a Black veteran, than that of a white veteran. And indeed, in a \ndecision dated December 8, 2010, VA rejected his application, relying again on the flawed 1971 \nCOD determination and failing to make a new COD determination. VA also reminded Mr. Monk \nthat it had previously denied his 1976 and 1982 applications for assistance.  \n102.  VAโs denial reaffirmed Mr. Monkโs disillusion and feelings of hopelessness. It \nalso compounded the financial stress on his family as they continued to pay for Mr. Monkโs \nmedical care. \n103.  In September 2011, Mr. Monk asked the Veterans Legal Services Clinic at Yale \nLaw School for assistance in seeking a discharge upgrade and VA benefits. The Clinic referred \nMr. Monk to a psychiatrist for evaluation. Over a total of four hours, Mr. Monk retold the \npsychiatrist the traumatic events that caused his PTSD. He relived the worst experiences of his \nlife, over and over again, to support his re-application for disability compensation.  \n104.  The psychiatrist concluded Mr. Monk had a severe case of PTSD, which arose \nfrom his military service in Vietnam.   \n105.  In February 2012, this time represented by the Clinic, Mr. Monk applied again for \ndisability compensation for PTSD, diabetes, and diabetic peripheral neuropathy in his arms and \nlegs. As the 2021 statistical analysis indicated, VA was more likely to deny Mr. Monkโs 2012 \napplication than that of a white veteran. And VA did so again, still relying on his discharge status \nand the flawed 1971 COD determination. VA did not conduct a new COD determination.  \n106.  Mr. Monk appealed. In September 2015, after Mr. Monk had obtained an upgrade \nof his discharge status through a separate application to the Board for Correction of Naval \n  19 \n\nCase 3:22-cv-01503-JBA   Document 1   Filed 11/28/22   Page 20 of 27\n \nRecords and litigation in U.S. district court, VA granted Mr. Monkโs disability compensation for \nPTSD with a 100% rating, as well as for diabetes and associated peripheral neuropathy.  \n107.  When VA finally granted Mr. Monk benefits, it erroneously assigned his claim an \nโeffective dateโ based solely on his discharge upgrade. VA refused to consider whether he was \neligible any earlier, as it continued to rely on its flawed and cursory 1971 COD determination. \nThis VA mistake cost Mr. Monk thousands of dollars in retroactive benefits. \n108.  Mr. Monk appealed again. The U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims held \nthat VA had erred in refusing to consider his eligibility for benefits before the date of his \ndischarge upgrade. Monk v. Wilkie, 2020 WL 2461722 (Vet. App. May 13, 2020).  \n109.  On remand, the Board of Veterans Appeals agreed, at long last, that even before it \nwas upgraded, โhis discharge . . . was not a bar to benefits.โ In re Monk, 2020 WL 8912950, at \n*1 (Bd. Vet. App. Dec. 15, 2020) (emphasis added) (granting disability compensation beginning \nFebruary 2012). This decision effectively overturned VAโs cursory 1971 COD determination that \nhad wrongly barred Mr. Monk from vital benefits and services for decades. Id. \n110.  VAโs decision granting disability compensation changed Mr. Monkโs life. For the \nfirst time, he felt truly recognized by VA for his service. He no longer felt beneath veterans who \nreceived benefits from VA. And most importantly, he could now provide for his family, his \nchurch, and his community in ways that he previously could not.  \nE.  VAโs Negligent Administration of Benefits Harmed Mr. Monk  \n111.  VAโs belated acknowledgement that Mr. Monk was eligible for benefits and \nservices even in the period before his discharge status was upgaded did not, however, make him \nwhole. Mr. Monk was and continues to be a victim of VAโs negligent administration of housing, \neducation, and disability benefits. \n  20 \n\nCase 3:22-cv-01503-JBA   Document 1   Filed 11/28/22   Page 21 of 27\n \n112.  VAโs negligence caused Mr. Monk to be denied veteransโ benefits to which he \nwas entitled. \n113.  VAโs negligence harmed Mr. Monk and his family both financially and \nemotionally.  \n114.  Each time Mr. Monk applied for VA benefits, he submitted extensive supporting \ndocumentation, filled out various VA forms, and interacted with VA officials.  \n115.  In the case of his third disability compensation application in 2012, Mr. Monk \nalso underwent psychiatric evaluations. Through painstaking detail, Mr. Monk relived and retold \nhis trauma to numerous individuals โ including doctors, his counsel, and character references โ \nto prove his eligibility for disability compensation.  \n116.  Mr. Monk also endured the emotional trauma of applying for VA benefits \nrepeatedly when VA initially denied his 2012 application, forcing him to navigate the appeal \nsystem and litigate two federal lawsuits to secure his benefits.  \n117.  The entire process exacerbated Mr. Monkโs PTSD and caused significant \nemotional distress.  \n118.  Upon returning home from his military service, Mr. Monk also suffered the severe \nreputational and dignitary harms associated with his benefit denials. The veteransโ community \nthat once embraced Mr. Monk as a son of a World War II veteran now looked down upon him. \nThe shame and stigma associated with his benefit denials caused Mr. Monk to feel like an \noutsider and a failure. He suffered significant emotional, dignitary, and reputational harm \nbecause of VAโs actions.  \n119.  Mr. Monk also suffered harm stemming from his perception of racial \ndiscrimination within the VA benefits system. He experienced this discrimination as an affront to \n  21 \n\nCase 3:22-cv-01503-JBA   Document 1   Filed 11/28/22   Page 22 of 27\n \nhis dignity, and it caused him emotional distress.  \n120.  Not only did Mr. Monk suffer significant emotional distress because of VAโs \nnegligent administration of benefits, but he also lost hundreds of thousands of dollars in \neducational, housing, and health care benefits.  \n121.  VAโs denial of education benefits forced Mr. Monk to leave the University of \nNew Haven before he could obtain his degree. Without the financial means to pay for college, he \nlost both the opportunity to complete his associateโs degree as well as the earning potential \nassociated with the degree. He and his family were thus deprived of the lifetime income and \nfinancial stability that a college degree would have provided. \n122.  After VA denied Mr. Monkโs home loan application, Mr. Monk spent months \napplying to other financial institutions to secure a home loan. He was homeless for a period of \ntime because of his inability to pay for housing. Although Mr. Monk eventually succeeded in \nsecuring a private home loan years later, the delay impacted him and his family as they lost the \neconomic and social benefits associated with homeownership.  \n123.  Finally, and most prominently, Mr. Monk and his family struggled to pay the \ncosts of his health care. For years, Mr. Monkโs family was forced to pay for medication and \ntreatments that would have been covered by VA had the agency granted his 1982 and 2010 \napplications. \n124.  VA eventually provided some benefits to Mr. Monk but only after years of delay \nand traumatization. However, the benefits he has received are inadequate, and not designed to \ncontemplate, the unique harm Mr. Monk suffered due to VAโs pattern of racial discrimination \nand the disparate impact on Black veterans. The indignity of racial discrimination is a distinct \ninjury, and this suit seeks redress for this harm VA caused to Mr. Monk.  \n  22 \n\nCase 3:22-cv-01503-JBA   Document 1   Filed 11/28/22   Page 23 of 27\n \nF.  Mr. Monk Timely Files This Complaint \n125.  Mr. Monk spent decades trying to obtain his rightfully owed benefits through \nVAโs administrative channels, but he was unaware of the pervasive and systematic racial bias \naffecting his eligibility for veteransโ benefits until VA disclosed long-withheld records to \nNVCLR in 2021, and those records were analyzed. \n126.  However, as evidenced by the data analysis discussed above, Mr. Monk now \nknows that he is one of thousands of Black veterans treated in a discriminatory manner by VA \nand subject to the racially disparate impact of VAโs operation of its benefits programs.  \n127.  While there was speculation for years that racial disparities existed in VAโs \nbenefits system, there was no data available to substantiate these claims prior to September 2021, \nwhen Mr. Monk, NVCLR, and BVP received the statistical analysis of the data from their FOIA \nrequests. There had been some publicly available reporting on the issue, but the full extent of the \nharm was not known until after this data was analyzed.  \n128.  Mr. Monk did not know, and had no way of knowing, about the racial disparities \nin VAโs administration of benefits until the records were disclosed and analyzed in 2021.  \n129.  Having discovered VAโs tortious conduct in September 2021, Mr. Monk \nsubmitted an administrative claim under the Federal Tort Claims Act in February 2022 and now \ntimely files this Complaint. He seeks not to relitigate his flawed 1971 COD determination and \nspecific benefits denials, but rather to hold VA accountable for its illegal, tortious, and racially \ndiscriminatory administration of benefits.  \nG.  Mr. Monk has Exhausted his Administrative Remedies Under the Federal \nTort Claims Act \n130.  The United States is liable pursuant to the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) for \nthe tortious acts of its employees in โcircumstances where the United States, if a private person, \n  23 \n\nCase 3:22-cv-01503-JBA   Document 1   Filed 11/28/22   Page 24 of 27\n \nwould be liable to the claimant in accordance with the law of the place where the act or omission \noccurred.โ 28 U.S.C. ยง 1346(b). \n131.  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 2675(a), a claimant must tender an administrative claim \nto the federal government before filing suit under the FTCA. An agencyโs failure to make a final \ndisposition of a claim within six months after it is filed โshall, at the option of the claimant any \ntime thereafter, be deemed a final denial of the claim.โ 28 U.S.C. ยง 2675(a).  \n132.  At all times relevant to this Complaint, VA officials acted within the scope of \ntheir employment and/or their official duties as employees of VA, an agency of the federal \ngovernment. \n133.  On February 25, 2022, Mr. Monk filed an FTCA administrative claim with VA \nfor the tortious actions alleged here and committed by VA leadership and officials acting under \nthe supervision of VA Administrators and, subsequently, VA Secretaries. \n134.  As of the filing of this Complaint, VA has not responded to Mr. Monkโs FTCA \nclaim. VAโs failure to dispose of Mr. Monkโs FTCA claim within six months of filing constitutes \na final denial. See 28 U.S.C. ยง 2675(a).  \n135.  Mr. Monk has administratively exhausted his claim under the FTCA. \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nFIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF  \n28 U.S.C. ยง 1346(b) โ Federal Tort Claims Act โ Negligence \n \n136.  Mr. Monk repeats and incorporates by reference each and every allegation \ncontained in the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.  \n137.  Under Connecticut law, negligence requires a showing of: (1) a duty of care to the \nplaintiff; (2) a breach of that duty; (3) proximate causation; and (4) damage to the plaintiff. \nLawrence v. O & G Indus., 126 A.3d 569, 574 (Conn. 2015). \n  24 \n\nCase 3:22-cv-01503-JBA   Document 1   Filed 11/28/22   Page 25 of 27\n \n138.  Federal law imposes a duty of care on the VA Secretary to administer veteransโ \nbenefits in a non-discriminatory manner. 38 U.S.C. ยง 303 (2018); 38 U.S.C. ยง 210(b) (1958). \n139.  VA Administrators and Secretaries, and other senior officials, breached this duty \nwhen through training, supervision, auditing, record-keeping, and other measures, they failed to \nredress longstanding, pervasive race discrimination and disparate impacts of which they knew or \nshould have known. \n140.  Due to this benefits obstruction, Mr. Monk was denied hundreds of thousands of \ndollarsโ worth of education, housing, and disability compensation. He also suffered significant \nemotional, psychological, and dignitary harm. \nSECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n28 U.S.C. ยง 1346(b) โ FTCA โ Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress \n \n141.  Mr. Monk repeats and incorporates by reference each and every allegation \ncontained in the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n142.  In Connecticut, a defendant engages in the tort of negligent infliction of emotional \ndistress when: (1) the defendantโs conduct created an unreasonable risk of causing the plaintiff \nemotional distress; (2) the plaintiffโs distress was foreseeable; (3) the emotional distress was \nsevere enough that it might result in illness or bodily harm; and (4) the defendantโs conduct was \nthe cause of the plaintiffโs distress. Carrol v. Allstate Ins. Co., 815 A.2d 119, 127 (Conn. 2003). \n143.  For over four decades, VA employees repeatedly denied Mr. Monkโs requests for \nVA education, housing, and disability compensation benefits. He endured numerous \npsychological and physical evaluations to apply for VA benefits.   \n144.  The failure of VA officials and employees to maintain a racially neutral system of \nadministering benefits led to a higher likelihood that he would be denied benefits, thus creating a \nrisk of psychological harm. \n  25 \n\nCase 3:22-cv-01503-JBA   Document 1   Filed 11/28/22   Page 26 of 27\n \n145.  It was foreseeable that Mr. Monk would experience emotional distress from \nhaving to relitigate his claims and navigate the VA benefits process over and over again.   \n146.  VA officials caused Mr. Monk to be so severely emotionally distressed that it \nmight result in illness or bodily harm. \n147.  As a result of the actions of VA officials and employees, Mr. Monk suffered \nsevere emotional distress, including exacerbation of his PTSD.  \nTHIRD CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n28 U.S.C. ยง 1346(b) โ FTCA โ Negligent Supervision \n \n148.  Mr. Monk repeats and incorporates by reference each and every allegation \ncontained in the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n149.  In Connecticut, negligent supervision occurs when: (1) the plaintiff suffers an \ninjury due to the defendantโs failure to supervise an employee; and (2) the defendant had a duty \nto supervise the employee. Roberts v. Circuit-Wise, Inc., 142 F. Supp. 2d 211, 213 (D. Conn. \n2001). The defendant has a duty of care where the defendant โknew or reasonably should have \nknown of the employeeโs propensity to engage in that type of tortious conduct.โ Id.  \n150.  VA officials and employees failed to instruct VA staff on how to distribute \nbenefits in a racially neutral way. Leadership failed to create a system in which data related to \nbenefits decisions could be aggregated and potential bias could be identified. Mr. Monk thus had \nto file his claims in a system that was racially discriminatory, lowering his chances of receiving \nthe benefits he deserved. \n151.  VA officials and employees knew or should have known about these failures but \nfailed to rectify them.   \n152.  VA leadershipโs negligent supervision of VA managers and adjudicators violated \ntheir statutory duty to ensure the proper execution of VA laws.  \n  26 \n\nCase 3:22-cv-01503-JBA   Document 1   Filed 11/28/22   Page 27 of 27\n \nREQUEST FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court grant the following relief: \n(1) Award Plaintiff compensatory damages in an amount to be determined at trial; \n(2) Require Defendant to pay Plaintiffโs reasonable fees, costs, and expenses, including \nattorneysโ fees, pursuant to the Equal Access to Justice Act, 28 U.S.C. ยง 2412(b); and \n(3) Grant such other relief as the Court deems just and equitable.  \nDated: November 28, 2022 \n  New Haven, Connecticut \n \nRespectfully Submitted, \n \nBy: /s/ Jason Parkin                             \nMichelle Fraling, Law Student Intern*1 \nRebecca Harris, Law Student Intern* \nAdam Henderson, Law Student Intern* \nBeatrice Pollard, Law Student Intern* \nMichael Sullivan, Law Student Intern* \nJason Parkin, ct28499 \nMichael J.
