    "summary": "<p>This is a case about the affordability of water and water shutoffs in Detroit, MI. On July 9, 2020, six individuals seeking to represent four classes and the nonprofit People&rsquo;s Water Board Coalition filed this class action lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan Southern Division. The classes they sought to represent include: current and future Detroit residents who reside in, or live in close proximity to, neighborhoods where disease has spread widely and has caused high rates of infection because of significant numbers of water shutoffs; current and future Detroit Water and Sewerage Department (DWSD) customers who are or will be at risk of becoming physically ill because they lack water service or are &ldquo;water insecure&rdquo;; residential DWSD customers who, within the last two years, have had their water service disconnected by Detroit for non-payment without Detroit first determining whether they had the means to pay and willfully refused to do so; and all Black residents of Detroit who, within the last two years, have had their water service disconnected by Detroit for non-payment or are at risk of losing water service once the city resumes shutoffs. The plaintiffs sued the City of Detroit, the Governor of Michigan, the Mayor of Detroit, and the Director of DWSD under the Fourteenth Amendment, the Fair Housing Act (FHA), and state law. Represented by the ACLU of Michigan, the Michigan Poverty Law Program, the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Inc., and private counsel, the plaintiffs sought declaratory relief and attorneys&rsquo; fees. The plaintiffs also sought a permanent injunction prohibiting the defendants from engaging in the unconstitutional and/or discriminatory conduct and requiring the defendants to take all steps necessary to remedy the effect of such conduct and prevent similar occurrences in the future. Finally, the plaintiffs sought compensatory damages for their violations of the constitution, FHA, and state law for injuries including monetary loss, humiliation, embarrassment, emotional distress, and depravation of rights. The plaintiffs sought punitive damages for the FHA violation for the City of Detroit&rsquo;s disregard for the plaintiff&rsquo;s rights and to deter the City from engaging in similar conduct in the future.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Plaintiffs claimed that the defendants shut off water as a collection method even though many households subject to termination cannot afford to pay market rates for water service. The lack of water service in many residents&rsquo; homes was humiliating to residents because of the City's practice of marking customers&rsquo; homes with bright blue paint when their water service was or was about to be disconnected, leading to the stigmatization of residents. According to plaintiffs, defendants established or used ineffective water assistance programs, which ensured a chronic lack of access to water to low income families. Defendants started the Water Restart Plan due to Covid, effectively admitting the correlation between the lack of water service and the spread of disease. The Governor did not ensure compliance. Defendants planned to resume the use of water shutoffs as a collection method after the coronavirus crisis had passed. It did not further any government interest to collect unpaid water debt by disconnecting the water service of predominately Black residential customers who did not have the means to pay because they were indigent, particularly as the disconnection of water service would result in increased risk of infection from COVID-19 and other diseases. Plaintiffs also alleged that the worsening of the pandemic would cause the City to suffer from increased hospitalizations and decrease in tax revenue. The case was assigned to District Judge Stephanie Dawkins Davis, but reassigned to District Judge Linda V. Parker on September 14, 2020. One week later the case was reassigned again to District Judge Denise Page Hood.</p>\r\n<p>On August 6, 2020 the Governor moved to dismiss. She alleged Eleventh Amendment immunity, that there was no constitutional right to water service or protection of the public, and that there was no state-created danger. The other defendants also filed a motion to dismiss on August 27, 2020. They argued there was no due process claim as the plaintiffs lacked standing, didn&rsquo;t allege conscience shocking behavior, and the right to bodily integrity did not encompass the right to be free of disease from a lack of water. The defendants also discredited the equal protection claim as a fundamental liberty interest was not being deprived and the City's policy was rationally related to a legitimate public purpose. As for the FHA and state law claims, defendants argued they were outside the scope of the statutes and the FHA claim fell short of disparate impact, which the plaintiffs also failed to state. In February of 2021 Judge Hood held a motion hearing.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs moved to compel mediation on February 7, 2022, which was denied October 4, 2022.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On December 12, 2022, the plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction prohibiting the defendants from terminating water service for purposes of debt collection or otherwise as a response to non-payment of water bills. As of December 29, 2022, the case is ongoing.&nbsp;</p>",

Water is a human right and a basic necessity, especially in a time of \npandemic. Access to safe, affordable water is critical to stop the spread of COVID-\n19 and other bacterial or viral infections through frequent handwashing and cleaning. \nIn  Detroit,  however,  thousands  of  residents—who  are  predominantly  and \ndisproportionately Black—have suffered from the lack of water service in their \nhomes for years. These residents, many of whom have had their water service \n2 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-11860-DPH-APP   ECF No. 1, PageID.3   Filed 07/09/20   Page 3 of 101\n \ntemporarily restored during the pandemic, will risk losing their water service again \nwhen Detroit resumes its water shutoff policy. The lack of water places these \nresidents and members of their communities, including schools, workplaces, and \nother shared spaces, at risk of contracting bodily illnesses, including COVID-19. \n2.  Detroit has had a water affordability crisis for decades.1 While water is \ngenerally considered “affordable” when families spend no more than 2% to 2.5% of \ntheir household incomes for water services,2 low-income Detroit residents must pay \n \n1  Detroit’s water  affordability crisis began in the  early 2000s.

When customers’ water bills go unpaid, DWSD, a department of the \nCity  of  Detroit,  disconnects  their  service  without  first  determining  whether \ncustomers have the means to pay their bills. The looming resumption of water \nshutoffs will exacerbate an existing public health emergency in Detroit absent this \nCourt’s intervention.  \n4.  Between 2014 and 2019, more than 141,000 households in Detroit had \ntheir water service disconnected for non-payment.5 Some families live for years \nwithout water service in their homes after a disconnection by DWSD. Others are \ntrapped  in  a  cycle  of  water  insecurity  with  repeated  disconnections  and \n \n3  Dahlia  Rockowitz  et  al.,  Household  Water  Security  in  Metropolitan  Detroit: \nMeasuring  the  Affordability  Gap,  Univ.  of  Mich.

These water insecure families risk losing service at any time because \nof their inability to pay DWSD’s rates. \n5.  In 2014, Detroit disconnected water service to approximately 44,000 \nhouseholds for non-payment of bills.6 In 2018, Detroit disconnected water service \nfrom more than 16,000 households.7 In 2019, shutoffs rose again to a total of \n23,473.8 As of January 2020, approximately 9,500 homes in Detroit were reportedly \nstill without water service.9  \n6.  Families  without  water  service  in  their  homes  are  susceptible  to \ninfection. Through the years, Detroit’s water shutoff policy has resulted in outbreaks \nof various forms of infectious diseases, as well as other threats to the health of \naffected families resulting from such things as the inability of people with diabetes \nto prepare medically necessary meals, the inability of parents to prepare infant \nformula, dehydration, and various other health consequences associated with the \nlack of water.

This has created a public \nhealth emergency in Detroit. \n7.  Despite repeated, consistent demands for remedial action by affected \ncommunities  and  their  advocates,  including  Plaintiff  People’s  Water  Board \nCoalition, Defendants’ response to this public health emergency has been woefully \ninadequate and appallingly weak. Defendants have failed to implement a program to \nensure that Detroit’s water insecure population has long-term access to affordable \nwater and Defendant Detroit has continued to employ water shutoffs as a collection \nmethod despite the known risks of living without water.   \n8.

Through its Water Restart Plan and Governor Whitmer’s Executive \nOrder (“EO”) 2020-28,20 Detroit has been required since March 2020 to halt its water \nshutoff policy and restore water service to all customers previously disconnected for \nnon-payment. On July 8, 2020, Defendant Whitmer rescinded EO 2020-28 and \nreplaced it with EO 2020-144, which requires the restoration of water service to \ncustomers  for  non-payment  until  December  31,  2020.21  However,  Defendant \nWhitmer has not taken the actions necessary to ensure long-term water affordability \nand access in Detroit. In fact, EO 2020-144 specifies that it does not relieve a \ncustomer of the obligation to pay for water, prevent a public water supply from \ncharging any customer for water service, or reduce the amount a resident may owe \nto a public water supply.22 \n \n20  Mich.

Additionally, while EO 2020-28 was in effect, she failed to ensure that \nmunicipalities like Detroit were in compliance with the order.  \n15.  In June 2020, the Michigan Legislature passed a bill that will, among \nother appropriations, grant $25 million to water utility providers across the state to \nassist  customers  with  arrearages  and  fees  incurred  during  the  COVID-19 \npandemic.23 This assistance is limited to $700 per household.24 It provides no relief \nto customers for arrearages incurred prior to the COVID-19 pandemic or after \nDecember 2020, nor any long-term relief for Detroit’s water insecure population. \nGovernor Whitmer signed the bill into law on July 1, 2020, but Defendant Detroit \nhas not indicated whether it will participate in the program.  \n16.  Defendants Detroit, Duggan, and Brown failed to fully comply with EO \n2020-28 and restore water service to all customers previously disconnected for non-\npayment  during  the  COVID-19  pandemic.  Upon  information  and  belief,  some \nfamilies in Detroit still lack water service as of the date of this filing, while the \npandemic  continues  to  threaten  the  health  of  city  residents.  Consequently, \nDefendants Detroit, Duggan, and Brown are also currently out of compliance with \nEO  2020-144,  which  replaced  EO  2020-28.  Further,  Defendant  Duggan  has \n \n23 Mich.

By creating conditions that contribute to and threaten the introduction \nof  infectious  disease  by  knowingly  and  purposefully  preventing  many  Detroit \nresidents from washing their hands, flushing their toilets, and cleaning their homes, \nDefendants have caused and continue to cause disastrous consequences for Plaintiffs \nand thousands of similarly situated individuals.  \n18.  Plaintiffs  bring  this  action  for  injunctive,  declaratory,  and \ncompensatory relief under the Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment to the \nU.S. Constitution, alleging that Defendants have violated their rights to substantive \ndue  process.  In  particular,  Plaintiffs  allege  that  Defendants  deliberately  and \nknowingly  breached  the  constitutionally  protected  bodily  integrity  of  Plaintiffs \nthrough their deliberate indifference to the known risks of living without water \nservice that could, did, and will cause harm to Plaintiffs.

From January 2017 to July 2018, 95% of residential water shutoffs \noccurred in  Census tracts  with a  population  that was  greater  than  50%  Black. \nAdditionally, from January 2019 to January 2020, 96% of residential water shutoffs \noccurred in zip codes with a population greater than 50% Black. These disparities \npersist  even  when  controlling  for  differences  in  income  and  the  number  of \nunoccupied homes in Detroit. \n22.  Defendant Detroit’s policy of disconnecting water service to customers \nfor  non-payment  causes  Black  residents  to  disproportionately  experience  water \nshutoffs, forcing them to live without water service in their homes.  \n12 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-11860-DPH-APP   ECF No. 1, PageID.13   Filed 07/09/20   Page 13 of 101\n \n23.

In  the  first  half  of  the  20th  century,  Detroit—the  epicenter  of  the \nAmerican automotive manufacturing industry—was a magnet for Black southerners \nrelocating to the city during the Great Migration for better economic opportunities \nand freedom from the discrimination they suffered in the Jim Crow South.26  \n \n26  Growing  Detroit’s  African-American  Middle  Class:  The  Opportunity  for  a \nProsperous  Detroit,  Detroit  Future  City  (Feb.  2019), \nhttps://detroitfuturecity.com/middleclassreport/#middle-in.  \n15 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-11860-DPH-APP   ECF No. 1, PageID.16   Filed 07/09/20   Page 16 of 101\n \n38.  By 1950, Detroit boasted the most prosperous Black community in the \ncountry, as measured by earnings and family income.27 \n39.  However,  Detroit’s  troubled  racial  history  and  the  automotive \nindustry’s downturn led to the city’s economic decline.28 In particular, racially \ndiscriminatory housing practices contributed to the city’s economic collapse. For \nexample,  the  large-scale  migration  of  white  Detroit  residents  to  the  suburbs \nbeginning in the 1960s—largely driven by fears of Black families moving into \npredominately white neighborhoods—contributed to the erosion of Detroit’s tax \nbase.29  Redlining  and  other  discriminatory  lending  practices  contributed  and \ncontinue  to  contribute  to  the  racial  wealth  gap  and  the  decline  of  Black \nhomeownership in Detroit.30 In addition, Detroit residents lost homes en masse due \n \n27 Reynolds Farley, The Bankruptcy of Detroit: What Role did Race Play?, 14 City \n&  Comm.  118,  124  (June  2015), \nhttps://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/112014/cico12106.pdf?se\nquence=1&isAllowed=y.  \n28 Sharon Cohen, Detroit’s Downfall: Decline of Autos, Troubled Racial History \nBlamed  for  City’s  Decline,  Star  Trib.

Prior to the bankruptcy filing, then-Governor Rick Snyder appointed an \n“emergency manager” in March 201333 to manage Detroit’s fiscal problems pursuant \nto a state law that authorizes Michigan’s governors to appoint individuals to perform \nthe functions of local government for municipalities determined to be in financial \ndistress.34  \n \nhttps://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/real-estate/2018/02/15/red-lining-\nhome-loans/110436482/.  \n31 Carl Hedman & Rolf Pendall, Rebuilding and Sustaining Homeownership for \nAfrican Americans, Urban Inst., Se.

In 2014, Detroit’s emergency manager, as part of his purported efforts \nto  address  the  city’s  fiscal  challenges,  attempted  to  privatize  Detroit’s  water \noperations by selling the facilities and operations of DWSD. DWSD increased use \nof water shutoffs as a collection method to eliminate delinquent water accounts, and \nthereby make the utility a more attractive product for potential buyers.  \n43.  A  sale  did  not  occur  because  of  Detroit’s  bankruptcy,  and  court-\nsupervised negotiations between the state, city, and suburban counties resulted in the \ncreation of Great Lakes Water Authority (“GLWA”). That entity was designated as \na “public body corporate” and it ultimately became the hub of a regional water \nsystem that included the City of Detroit, Wayne County, Oakland County, and \nMacomb County. \n44.  GLWA leases Detroit’s water system from the city and uses Detroit’s \nwater and sewer infrastructure to extend service to neighboring suburban counties.  \nWater Rates and Assistance Programs in Detroit  \n45.  For years, Detroit residents have suffered from the lack of access to \naffordable water. While water is generally considered “affordable” when families \nspend no more than 2% to 2.5% of their household incomes for water services,35 \nlow-income  Detroit  residents  must  pay  an  average  of  10%  of  their  household \n \n35 See, e.g., supra note 2.  \n18 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-11860-DPH-APP   ECF No. 1, PageID.19   Filed 07/09/20   Page 19 of 101\n \nincomes on water,36 and some must pay much more.37 As a result, many families in \nDetroit struggle to pay their water bills.  \n46.  In response to public complaints that a high poverty rate in Detroit \nguarantees widespread termination of water service, Defendants have established or \nused water assistance programs that they know to be ineffective, and which ensure \na chronic lack of access to water to low income families. These programs include \nthe “10-30-50” program, and the Water Residential Assistance Program (“WRAP”), \nwhich is financed by GLWA.  \n47.  Pursuant to the 10-30-50 program, a customer makes a down payment \nof 10%, 30%, or 50% of the past due balance.38 The percentage is based on the \nnumber of payment plans the customer entered into over the last 18 months; first \ntime is 10%, second time is 30%, third time or more is 50%.39 The balance of the \npast due amount is equally spread over a six to 24-month period which the customer \npays in addition to the normal monthly bill (months are determined by the balance \n \n36 See Rockowitz et al., supra note 3. \n37 See Kay et al., supra note 4.  \n38  City  of  Detroit  Water  &  Sewerage  Dep’t,  Payment  Plan, \nhttps://detroitmi.gov/departments/water-and-sewerage-department/bill-assistance-\nand-credits/payment-plan (last visited July 7, 2020).  \n39 Id. \n19 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-11860-DPH-APP   ECF No. 1, PageID.20   Filed 07/09/20   Page 20 of 101\n \nowed).40 All payments must be made in full and on time to stay in the plan, and there \nare no income restrictions to qualify.41 Upon information and belief, DWSD has \ndiscretion to determine whether a customer is eligible for enrollment into the 10-30-\n50 program and does not purport to consider a customer’s indigency or ability to pay \nto determine eligibility.  \n48.  Launched on March 1, 2016, WRAP provides qualifying customers \nwho are at or below 150% of the federal poverty threshold with a $25 monthly credit \ntoward current bills with any past-due or arrearages frozen for 12 months.42 DWSD \ncustomers who successfully make their monthly payments for one year receive up \nto $700 in credit toward their past due bill.43 The WRAP program only provides \ncustomers with two years of assistance. Thereafter, customers must pay the full \namount  of  their  bills.  Upon  information  and  belief,  DWSD  has  discretion  to \ndetermine whether a customer is eligible for enrollment into WRAP and does not \ninquire into a customer’s ability to pay to determine eligibility. \n \n40 Id. \n41 Id.  \n42  Community  Action  Alliance  Water  Residential  Assistance  Program,  City  of \nDetroit  Water  and  Sewerage  Department  Frequently  Asked  Questions, \nhttps://detroitmi.gov/sites/detroitmi.localhost/files/2018-\n02/WRAP%20FAQ_2.pdf.  \n43 Id.  \n20 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-11860-DPH-APP   ECF No. 1, PageID.21   Filed 07/09/20   Page 21 of 101\n \n49.  Both the 10-30-50 program and WRAP are designed to provide limited, \nshort-term  assistance  to  families  facing  temporary  financial  instability.  Neither \nprogram makes water service affordable for families facing chronic poverty, who \nare not able to pay for water at market rates. \n50.  Water  affordability  advocates,  including  Plaintiff  People’s  Water \nBoard Coalition and its member organizations, have repeatedly urged Defendants to \nadopt  a  program that will  make water affordable  for  everyone—specifically,  a \nprogram  that  indexes  billing  to  actual  household  income.  Defendants  have \nrepeatedly rejected such programs since at least 2005, including a water affordability \nplan  proposed  by  a  member  organization  of  Plaintiff  People’s  Water  Board \nCoalition.44 \nDetroit’s Water Shutoff Policy \n51.  Defendants City of Detroit, Duggan, and Brown have persisted in the \npractice of employing water shutoffs as a collection method with full knowledge that \nmany households subject to termination cannot afford to pay market rates for water \nservice. \n52.

DWSD’s  procedures  regarding  discontinuation  and  termination  of \nwater  service  are  set  forth  in  its  “Interim  Collection  Rules  and  Procedures.”45 \nDefendant Detroit has previously asserted that the Interim Rules are no longer in \nplace. Upon information and belief, no subsequent collection rules and procedures \nhave been approved for use by DWSD. However, DWSD has posted a one paragraph \nsummary of its policies on its website (“Customer Policies”).46 For purposes of this \nComplaint, both the Interim Rules and Customer Policies are described below.  \n54.  Rule 1(1) of the Interim Collection Rules and Procedures provides that \nresidential customers are billed quarterly.47 Rule 1(2) requires DWSD to mail bills \nto customers at least 20 days before the due date.48 Rule 6(2)(a)-(b) provides that a \ncustomer who fails to pay their bill by the due date is issued a “Past Due Notice” 11 \n \n45 City of Detroit Water & Sewerage Dep’t, Interim Collection Rules and Procedures \n(revised Jan. 22, 2003) (attached as Exhibit 1) [hereinafter Interim Rules]. \n46  City  of  Detroit  Water  &  Sewerage  Dep’t,  Customer  Policies, \nhttps://detroitmi.gov/departments/water-and-sewerage-department/customer-\ncare/customer-policies [hereinafter Customer Policies]. \n47 Interim Rules, supra note 45, at 1.

Rule 19 of the Interim Collection Rules and Procedures authorizes \nDWSD to discontinue a customer’s service if a bill is not paid within 10 days of the \ndate  specified  as  the  “Notice  Date”  on  the  “WATER  SHUT  OFF-FINAL \nNOTICE.”50 \n56.  Rule 24 of the Interim Collection Rules and Procedures authorizes \nDWSD to shut off water service to a customer for non-payment for a delinquent \nbalance, provided that DWSD notified the customer of a delinquency and made \ndiligent efforts to have the customer pay the outstanding or delinquent balance, \neither in whole or through a reasonable payment plan agreement (“PPA”).51 \n57.  Rule 27 of the Interim Collection Rules and Procedures authorizes \nDWSD  to  negotiate  a  reasonable  PPA  with  a  customer  when  “extenuating \ncircumstances” exist and payment cannot be made in full.52 \n58.  DWSD’s Customer Policies contain limited information about its water \nshutoff procedures. The policies state, in relevant part, “[c]ustomers are responsible \n \n49 Id. at 3.  \n50 Id. at 9.  \n51 Id. at 11-12.  \n52 Id. at 13. \n23 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-11860-DPH-APP   ECF No. 1, PageID.24   Filed 07/09/20   Page 24 of 101\n \nfor paying bills on time and in full. As part of DWSD’s continuing efforts to keep \nrates low, customers who fail to keep their accounts current will be issued a final \nnotice to pay the past-due bill. Service interruptions procedures begin if payment has \nnot been received by the due date stated in the Final Notice.”53 \n59.  DWSD’s  Customer  Policies  direct  customers  who  have  difficulty \npaying their past due balance to the 10-30-50 program and WRAP.54 The Customer \nPolicies do not mention PPAs or whether DWSD considers a customer’s ability to \npay prior to disconnecting their service.55 Upon information and belief, the Interim \nRules pertaining to PPAs have been substituted by the 10-30-50 program. \n60.  DWSD previously hung notices on customers’ doors that informed \nthem of an impending service disconnection no later than seven days prior to the \ndisconnection, pursuant to an informal policy. However,  upon information and \nbelief, DWSD no longer hangs such notices on customers’ doors.  \n61.  DWSD’s  physical  offices  are  currently  closed  to  the  public  and \ncustomers are left with limited options to enroll in the 10-30-50 program or WRAP. \nUpon  information  and  belief,  customers  are  allowed  to  enroll  in  these  water \nassistance programs only via telephone.

Additionally, many low-income residents of Detroit use prepaid cell phones with \na set number of usable minutes per month. Being on hold with DWSD to obtain \nassistance is a financial burden many cannot afford.  \n62.  Upon information and belief, DWSD disconnects water service to many \nof its customers without first attempting to determine their ability to pay. \n63.  Between 2014 and 2019, more than 141,000 households in Detroit had \ntheir water service disconnected for non-payment.56 Some families live for years \nwithout water service in their homes after a disconnection by DWSD. Others are \ntrapped  in  a  cycle  of  water  insecurity  with  repeated  disconnections  and \nreconnections. These families risk losing water service at any time because of their \nchronic poverty and inability to pay DWSD’s rates for water services. \n64.

Comp.  Laws  Ann. \n§ 333.2251), requiring the health director to take “immediate action” to suspend \nshutoffs; and (2) whether the spread of water-borne illness constitutes an “epidemic” \nas defined by state law (Mich.

Among other appropriations, SB 690 grants $25 million in limited \nwater  utility  assistance  for  households  across  the  state.90  Pursuant  to  the  bill, \nMDHHS will  make payments to  water utility providers  to  reimburse them for \nproviding bill forgiveness for arrearages and fees incurred by customers during the \nCOVID-19 state of emergency.91 It will also require utilities to provide a 25% \ndiscount on the total water bill for eligible customers through the end of December \n2020.92 The maximum reimbursement for each household is $700.93 \n87.  To receive funds under the bill, water utility providers must agree to a \nnumber of conditions, including that they will (1) not shut off water service to \nresidential customers for at least 90 days beyond the date that the customer receives \nwater utility assistance; (2) forgive 25% of the amount billed for water service to \nresidential customers before December 1, 2020; and (3) notify customers of the \ndiscount provided and bill forgiveness, among other requirements.94 \n \n90 SB 0690, supra note 23, at § 107(2). \n91 Id. at § 404(2). \n92 Id. \n93 Id.  \n94 Id. at § 404(3)(a)-(3). \n35 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-11860-DPH-APP   ECF No. 1, PageID.36   Filed 07/09/20   Page 36 of 101\n \n88.

On information and belief, Defendant Detroit has not indicated whether \nit will comply with the conditions required under SB 690 and accept funds for water \nutility assistance. \n91.  The water assistance program established by SB 690 does not provide \nany relief to customers for arrearages incurred prior to or after the COVID-19 \npandemic and provides no long-term relief for Detroit’s water insecure population. \n92.

Plaintiffs risk infection not only as a result of not having access to water \nfor disease prevention through handwashing and other cleaning measures, but also \nas a consequence of their residence in neighborhoods where there are high disease \ninfection  rates  caused  by  significant  numbers  of  water  shutoffs.  In  these \nenvironments, the risk of contact with infected persons and hazardous conditions are \nsignificantly increased. One researcher connected spikes in three diseases to water \nshutoffs in Detroit.130 The diseases observed were shigellosis (an acute dysentery); \ngiardiasis (a protozoan infection); and campylobacter (an acute intestinal disease).131 \nThe researcher took special note of findings regarding patients at Detroit’s Henry \nFord Hospital: “Patients who came from blocks with water shut off[s] were 1.55 \ntimes more likely to be diagnosed with a water associated illness. Also, if the patient \nhad waterborne disease, they more likely lived on a block with a shut off.”132 \nWater Shutoffs Disproportionately Impact Black Residents in Detroit \n106.

Plaintiff Jacqueline Taylor is a 66-year-old Black resident of Detroit. \nShe owns her home in zip code 48203. Ms. Taylor’s monthly average income from \nSocial Security benefits is $860. Ms. Taylor has disabilities and has had a home \nhealth aide assisting her in her home.  \n122.  Due to Ms. Taylor’s age, she is at a heightened risk of developing life-\nthreatening complications if she contracts COVID-19.  \n58 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-11860-DPH-APP   ECF No. 1, PageID.59   Filed 07/09/20   Page 59 of 101\n \n123.  In January and February 2016, Ms. Taylor was hospitalized and in a \nrehabilitation center for a hip replacement. At that time, no one was living in her \nhome or using her water service. Prior to her surgery, she had two inspections of her \nhome to confirm she had no water leaks. She also had a new toilet installed around \nthat time. \n124.  After returning home from her surgery, Ms. Taylor received a bill from \nDWSD for water usage totaling approximately 75,000 gallons during the period in \nwhich no one was living in her home. The bill was approximately $1,500 to $2,000.  \n125.  Ms. Taylor contacted DWSD regarding the bill, but the department \nrefused to adjust it. Ms. Taylor could not afford to pay the bill and believes she was \noverbilled. \n126.  Ms. Taylor tried to enroll in WRAP but was unable to do so.  \n127.  DWSD eventually disconnected Ms. Taylor’s water service in mid-\n2018. By that time, DWSD claimed that she owed nearly $6,000 in water service \narrearages. DWSD did not affirmatively confirm whether Ms. Taylor had the ability \nto pay her bill before disconnecting her service. \n128.  Ms. Taylor lived without water service in her home from mid-2018 \nuntil March 2020, after the announcement of Detroit’s Water Restart Plan and EO \n2020-28.  \n59 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-11860-DPH-APP   ECF No. 1, PageID.60   Filed 07/09/20   Page 60 of 101\n \n129.  During the time that Ms. Taylor had no water service in her home, We \nthe People of Detroit donated four cases of bottled water to Ms. Taylor every two \nweeks, so that she had water for handwashing, drinking, bathing, cleaning, and \nsanitation. She would also go to her son’s house to bathe. \n130.  During the time that Ms. Taylor lacked water service, she would wash \nher hands by first warming a bowl of donated bottled water in the microwave. She \nwould then pour the warmed water on her hands, lather with soap, and rinse her \nhands with additional bottled water. \n131.  DWSD reconnected Ms. Taylor’s water service in March 2020, after \nthe announcement of the Water Restart Plan and EO 2020-28. Her current monthly \nbill is $25 pursuant to the plan, and she still owes DWSD the prior arrearages.  \n132.  Ms. Taylor has called DWSD to inquire about enrolling in WRAP but \nhas not been able to reach anyone.  \n133.  When Detroit resumes water shutoffs, Ms. Taylor will be at immediate \nrisk of losing water service to her home due to her low income and inability to pay \nher water bill, including prior arrearages.  \n134.  Plaintiff Lisa Brooks is a 55-year-old Black resident of Detroit. She has \nrented her home in zip code 48221 for ten years. She lives in the home with two of \nher children, ages 14 and 16. Her monthly income is approximately $1,200 from \nSocial Security disability and the Michigan Bridges food assistance program.  \n60 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-11860-DPH-APP   ECF No. 1, PageID.61   Filed 07/09/20   Page 61 of 101\n \n135.  Ms.  Brooks  has  chronic  obstructive  pulmonary  disease,  diabetes, \narthritis, and other breathing issues. She must use a portable oxygen tank to assist \nher breathing. Her 16-year-old son has asthma and uses a nebulizer, which requires \nthe use of water.  \n136.  Under the terms of her lease, Ms. Brooks is required to pay her water \nbill, which is in her name. \n137.  DWSD first disconnected Ms. Brooks’s water service in 2018. DWSD \ndid not affirmatively confirm whether Ms. Brooks had the ability to pay her bill \nbefore disconnecting her service. \n138.  Ms. Brooks and her children lived without water for about a year. \nDuring this time, Ms. Brooks received water assistance from We the People of \nDetroit, which provided her with eight to 12 cases of water every two weeks for \nhandwashing, drinking, bathing, cleaning, and sanitation. She would also go to \nrelatives’ homes to bathe.  \n139.  In 2019, Ms. Brooks was able to have her service  reconnected by \nDWSD. She entered into a payment plan with DWSD, which required her to pay her \ncurrent monthly bill (typically around $100 a month) plus $98 per month. This \nrequired payment was approximately 17% of Ms. Brooks’s total monthly income.  \n140.  Ms. Brooks was unable to keep up with the payment plan due to her \nlow income. DWSD disconnected her water service again in the winter of 2019. \n61 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-11860-DPH-APP   ECF No. 1, PageID.62   Filed 07/09/20   Page 62 of 101\n \nOnce again, DWSD did not affirmatively confirm whether Ms. Brooks had the \nability to pay her bill before disconnecting her service. Ms. Brooks and her children \nlived without water service in their home until March 2020. During this time, Ms. \nBrooks again obtained water from We the People of Detroit. \n141.  During the time that Ms. Brooks lacked water service, she would wash \nher hands by wetting them with donated bottled water, adding soap, and then rinsing \nwith more bottled water. \n142.  DWSD reconnected Ms. Brooks’s water service in March 2020, after \nthe announcement of the Water Restart Plan and EO 2020-28. She is paying $25 a \nmonth for her water service as part of that plan. \n143.  Ms. Brooks currently owes DWSD around $2,000 in arrearages. \n144.  When Detroit resumes water shutoffs, Ms. Brooks will be at immediate \nrisk of losing water service to her home due to her low income and inability to pay \nher water bill.  \n145.  Ms. Brooks’s children, who attend high school, have been distance \nlearning since March 2020. They are expected to return to school this fall. This may \nincrease their risk of COVID-19 infection, particularly if there is a second wave of \ninfections this winter, and also places Ms. Brooks at a greater risk of infection. This \nrisk will be exacerbated if DWSD disconnects water service to Ms. Brooks’s home \n62 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-11860-DPH-APP   ECF No. 1, PageID.63   Filed 07/09/20   Page 63 of 101\n \nafter the expiration of EO 2020-144 and they do not have running water to wash \ntheir hands, flush their toilets, or clean their home.  \n146.  According to an analysis conducted by the Brookings Institution, Ms. \nBrooks lives in a zip code with one of the highest concentrations of COVID-19 \ninfections in Detroit.140 The zip code where Ms. Brooks resides, 48221, has a \npopulation that is 92.9% Black. From January 2019 to January 2020, this zip code \nhad 58.86 shutoffs for every 1,000 persons and was ranked fifth in number of \nshutoffs among 25 zip codes with available data.  \n147.  Ms. Brooks and her family live in close physical proximity to many \npersons who are infected or who have a highly enhanced risk of infection of COVID-\n19 or other diseases and who may lack water service to wash their hands, flush their \ntoilets, or clean their homes. This places Ms. Brooks and her family at a heightened \nrisk of infection of COVID-19 or other diseases. \n148.  Plaintiff Michele Cowan is a 42-year-old Black resident of Detroit. She \nowns her home with her 23-year-old daughter in zip code 48227. Ms. Cowan lives \nwith two of her adult daughters and her two grandchildren, ages two and six. Her \nfamily’s income is approximately $1,300 per month.  \n \n140 Henry-Nickie & Hudak, supra note 15. \n63 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-11860-DPH-APP   ECF No. 1, PageID.64   Filed 07/09/20   Page 64 of 101\n \n149.  Ms. Cowan works at a home health aide service for elderly persons. She \ndid not work between March and early June 2020 due to the risk of contracting \nCOVID-19, but returned to work in mid-June 2020. Her employment exposes her to \nan increased risk of contracting and spreading COVID-19.  \n150.  DWSD disconnected Ms. Cowan’s water service in August 2019 for \napproximately $700 in arrearages. She still owes DWSD this amount. DWSD did \nnot affirmatively confirm whether Ms. Cowan had the ability to pay her bill before \ndisconnecting her service. \n151.  Ms. Cowan previously tried to enroll in WRAP but was informed she \ndid not qualify for the program.  \n152.  Ms. Cowan and her family lived without water from August 2019 until \nMarch 2020. During this time, We the People of Detroit provided Ms. Cowan and \nher family with bottled water for handwashing, drinking, bathing, cleaning, and \nsanitation. She would receive eight to 10 cases of water every two weeks from the \norganization.  \n153.  During the time that Ms. Cowan lacked water service, she would wash \nher hands by wetting them with donated bottled water, adding soap, and then rinsing \nwith more bottled water.  \n154.  DWSD reconnected Ms. Cowan’s water service in March 2020, after \nthe announcement of the Water Restart Plan and EO 2020-28.  \n64 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-11860-DPH-APP   ECF No. 1, PageID.65   Filed 07/09/20   Page 65 of 101\n \n155.  When Detroit resumes water shutoffs, Ms. Cowan will be at immediate \nrisk of losing water service to her home due to her low income and inability to pay \nher water bill.  \n156.  Ms. Cowan’s six-year-old grandchild has been distance learning since \nMarch 2020, and is expected to return to school in the fall. This may increase her \ngrandchild’s risk of COVID-19 infection, particularly if there is a second wave of \ninfections this winter, and also places Ms. Cowan and her family at a greater risk of \ninfection. This risk will be exacerbated if DWSD disconnects water service to Ms. \nCowan’s home after the expiration of EO 2020-144 and they do not have running \nwater to wash their hands, flush their toilets, or clean their home.  \n157.  According to an analysis conducted by the Brookings Institution, Ms. \nCowan lives in a zip code with one of the highest concentrations of COVID-19 \ninfections in  Detroit.141  The  zip  code  where  Ms.  Cowan  resides,  48227, has a \npopulation that is 96.7% Black. From January 2019 to January 2020, this zip code \nhad 41.85 shutoffs for every 1,000 persons and was ranked 10th in number of \nshutoffs among 25 zip codes with available data. \n158.

This places Ms. Cowan and her family at a heightened \nrisk of infection of COVID-19 or other diseases. \n159.  The lack of water service in her home has been very stressful for Ms. \nCowan and her family. She has anxiety over the prospect of losing water service \nwhen DWSD resumes shutoffs.  \n160.  Plaintiff Tuana Henry is a 45-year-old Black resident of Detroit. She \nowns her home in the west side of the city, in zip code 48204. She has eight children \nliving with her, six of whom are under the age of 18. Ms. Henry’s income averages \nbetween $1,200 and  $1,500 per  month. Ms.  Henry has  asthma  and bronchitis, \nrequiring the use of a water-based nebulizer and other inhalants.   \n161.  Due to her low income, Ms. Henry enrolled in WRAP in approximately \n2016. However, due to the cost, she was unable to pay her monthly bill and the \nrequired payment on her delinquent bill. Between 2016 and 2020, Ms. Henry’s water \nservice was disconnected by DWSD for non-payment several times. DWSD marked \nMs. Henry’s property with bright blue spray paint to show that her water service had \nbeen disconnected. DWSD did not affirmatively confirm whether Ms. Henry had the \nability to pay her bill before disconnecting her service. \n162.  In  approximately  May  2019,  Ms.  Henry’s  water  service  was \ndisconnected by DWSD. She lived without water service from May 2019 until \n66 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-11860-DPH-APP   ECF No. 1, PageID.67   Filed 07/09/20   Page 67 of 101\n \nMarch 2020. During the time that she lived without water service, Ms. Henry would \npurchase bottled water or fill up gallons from her son’s home or her neighbor’s \nhome. She once received water from the Michigan Welfare Rights Organization.  \n163.  During the time that Ms. Henry lacked water service, she would wash \nher hands by wetting them with donated bottled water, adding soap, rinsing with \nmore bottled water, and then drying her hands. \n164.  DWSD reconnected Ms. Henry’s water service in March 2020, after the \nannouncement of the Water Restart Plan and EO 2020-28.  \n165.  When Detroit resumes water shutoffs, Ms. Henry will be at immediate \nrisk of losing water service to her home due to her low income and inability to pay \nher water bill.  \n166.  Six of Ms. Henry’s children attend school. They have been distance \nlearning since March 2020, but are expected to return to school in the fall. This may \nincrease her children’s risk of COVID-19 infection, particularly if there is a second \nwave of infections this winter, and also places Ms. Henry and her family at a greater \nrisk of infection. This risk will be exacerbated if DWSD disconnects water service \nto Ms. Henry’s home after the expiration of EO 2020-144 and she and her family do \nnot have running water to wash their hands, flush their toilets, or clean their home.  \n167.  According to an analysis conducted by the Brookings Institution, Ms. \nHenry lives in a zip code with one of the highest concentrations of COVID-19 \n67 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-11860-DPH-APP   ECF No. 1, PageID.68   Filed 07/09/20   Page 68 of 101\n \ninfections  in  Detroit.142  The  zip  code  where  Ms.  Henry  resides,  48204,  has  a \npopulation that is 95.8% Black. From January 2019 to January 2020, this zip code \nhad 78.57 shutoffs for every 1,000 persons and was ranked second in number of \nshutoffs among 25 zip codes with available data. \n168.  Ms. Henry and her family live in close physical proximity to many \npersons who are infected or who have a highly enhanced risk of infection of COVID-\n19 or other diseases and who may lack water service to wash their hands, flush their \ntoilets, or clean their homes. This places Ms. Henry and her family at a heightened \nrisk of infection of COVID-19 or other diseases. \n169.  Ms. Henry  fears that she will contract COVID-19 and that it will \nexacerbate her existing medical conditions if her water service is terminated again.  \n170.  Plaintiff Mattie McCorkle is a 41-year-old Black resident of Detroit. \nShe owns her home in zip code 48217. Ms. McCorkle lives in her home with her \nhusband and three children, ages 18, 12, and six. She and her husband had a joint \nincome of approximately $22,000 in 2019.  \n171.  Ms.  McCorkle  and  her  husband  are  both  essential  workers.  Ms. \nMcCorkle is employed as a restaurant server. She did not work from March to June \n2020 due to COVID-19, but is now back at work. Ms. McCorkle and her husband’s \n \n142 Id. \n68 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-11860-DPH-APP   ECF No. 1, PageID.69   Filed 07/09/20   Page 69 of 101\n \nroles as essential workers increase their risk of COVID-19 infection. Ms. McCorkle \nis very concerned that she or her husband may contract or spread COVID-19.  \n172.  In 2016, DWSD disconnected Ms. McCorkle’s water service for non-\npayment. DWSD did not affirmatively confirm whether Ms. McCorkle had the \nability to pay her bill before disconnecting her service. \n173.  Following  her  service  disconnection,  Ms.  McCorkle  enrolled  in \nWRAP. However, she was unable to keep up with her payments to DWSD. In 2018, \nDWSD disconnected Ms. McCorkle’s water service again. She looked to enroll in \nan assistance program at that time but was informed she did not qualify for WRAP.  \n174.  Ms. McCorkle lived without water service in her home from 2018 until \nApril or May 2020. Initially, Ms. McCorkle struggled to get water donated to her \nhome for handwashing, drinking, bathing, cleaning, and sanitation. Eventually she \nwas connected to We the People of Detroit, which would deliver eight cases of water \nevery two weeks to her home.  \n175.  DWSD did not reconnect Ms. McCorkle’s water service until late April \nor early May 2020. Her water pipes are in need of repairs. Currently, she can only \nobtain water from the basement of her house. She must fill up jugs to use the water \nin other areas of her home.  \n176.  In order to wash her hands, Ms. McCorkle must fill up a pail or bucket \nof water from her basement, bring it upstairs, boil it on her hot water heater, and then \n69 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-11860-DPH-APP   ECF No. 1, PageID.70   Filed 07/09/20   Page 70 of 101\n \nlather with soap and rinse. She is able to use this water from her basement for \nhandwashing and cleaning her dishes, but it is difficult for her to use it for other \ncleaning purposes.  \n177.  Ms. McCorkle is currently paying $25 a month for her water service \nunder the Water Restart Plan, but also owes DWSD past arrearages.  \n178.  When  Detroit  resumes  water  shutoffs,  Ms.  McCorkle  will  be  at \nimmediate risk of losing water service to her home due to her low income and \ninability to pay her water bill. She is very concerned about the lack of water service \nfor herself and her family.  \n179.  According to an analysis conducted by the Brookings Institution, Ms. \nMcCorkle lives in a zip code with one of the highest concentrations of COVID-19 \ninfections in Detroit.143 The zip code where Ms. McCorkle resides, 48217, has a \npopulation that is 96.7% Black.

This  places  Ms.  McCorkle  and  her  family  at  a \nheightened risk of infection of COVID-19 or other diseases. \n181.  Plaintiff Renee Wilson is a 49-year-old Black resident of Detroit. She \nowns her home in Detroit’s Brightmoor neighborhood, in zip code 48223. Ms. \nWilson lives with her son and minor grandchild. Nine of Ms. Wilson’s minor \ngrandchildren, ranging in age from one year to 16 years old, frequently visit her \nhome, including staying overnight. Ms. Wilson’s monthly income is $659 from \nSocial Security disability benefits, or $7,908 annually. For a household of three \npeople, this is less than 50% of the federal poverty level.144 \n182.  In 2016 and 2017, DWSD disconnected Ms. Wilson’s water service on \ntwo occasions. In approximately 2017, Ms. Wilson was enrolled in WRAP. Under \nthe terms of the plan, Ms. Wilson was required to pay her current bill, which \naverages around $200 per month, and $200 per month on her delinquent bill. This \nrequired payment of $400 a month is more than 60% of her entire monthly income.  \n183.  In May 2019, Ms. Wilson was unable to make her monthly payment to \nDWSD. As a result, her water service was disconnected. While she was unable to \nmake her payments, DWSD did not affirmatively confirm whether Ms. Wilson had \nthe ability to pay her bill before disconnecting her service. \n \n144 U.S. Dep’t of Health & Human Servs., Off. of the Ass’t Sec’y for Planning and \nEval., Poverty Guidelines (Jan. 8, 2020), https://aspe.hhs.gov/poverty-guidelines.  \n71 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-11860-DPH-APP   ECF No. 1, PageID.72   Filed 07/09/20   Page 72 of 101\n \n184.  Ms. Wilson had no water service in her home between May 2019 and \nMay 2020. Ms. Wilson’s church donated 30 cases of bottled water to her every two \nweeks for handwashing, drinking, bathing, cleaning, and sanitation. \n185.  During the time that Ms. Wilson lacked water service, she would wash \nher hands by warming donated bottled water on the stove, placing it in a bowl, \nwetting her hands with water and soap, and then rinsing with bottled water. She \nwould also use hand sanitizer.  \n186.  On April 14, 2020, DWSD sent Ms. Wilson a bill for $3,111.78 for \narrearages owed prior to her shutoff in May 2019. On May 4, she called DWSD to \ndetermine if she had a reconnection fee. At no time did DWSD advise Ms. Wilson \nthat the Water Restart Plan and EO 2020-28 required the restoration of water service \nto Detroit residents. On May 4, Brightmoor Food Pantry paid Ms. Wilson’s full \nwater bill and her water service was restored that month.  \n187.  When Detroit resumes water shutoffs, Ms. Wilson will be at immediate \nrisk of losing water service to her home due to her low income and inability to pay \nher water bill. Her average monthly bill of $200 is approximately 30% of her \nmonthly income.  \n188.  According to an analysis conducted by the Brookings Institution, Ms. \nWilson lives in a zip code with one of the highest concentrations of COVID-19 \n72 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-11860-DPH-APP   ECF No. 1, PageID.73   Filed 07/09/20   Page 73 of 101\n \ninfections in Detroit.145 The zip code where Ms. Wilson resides, 48223, has a \npopulation that is 89.7% Black. From January 2019 to January 2020, this zip code \nhad 30 shutoffs for every 1,000 persons and was ranked 13th in number of shutoffs \namong 25 zip codes with available data. \n189.  Ms. Wilson and her family live in close physical proximity to many \npersons who are infected or who have a highly enhanced risk of infection of COVID-\n19 or other diseases and who may lack water service to wash their hands, flush their \ntoilets, or clean their homes. This places Ms. Wilson and her family at a heightened \nrisk of infection of COVID-19 or other diseases. \n190.  Plaintiff People’s Water Board Coalition and its member organizations \nhave  engaged  in  advocacy  and  expended  resources  to  advocate  for  water \naffordability in Detroit for nearly two decades. \n191.  For years, the Coalition has urged local officials in Detroit, including \nthe  Mayor  and  City  Council,  to  impose  a  moratorium  on  water  shutoffs  and \nimplement a water affordability plan so that the city’s low-income residents can \nafford their water bills. Coalition members have attended city council and town hall \nmeetings, provided testimony, written letters, and arranged for media interviews on \nwater issues. The Coalition has also engaged in state- and federal-level advocacy \n \n145 Henry-Nickie & Hudak, supra note 15. \n73 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-11860-DPH-APP   ECF No. 1, PageID.74   Filed 07/09/20   Page 74 of 101\n \nwith the Governor, state legislators, and congressional representatives on these \nissues.  \n192.  On March 16, 2020, the Coalition sent a letter to Defendant Whitmer, \nexpressing  concern  with  Detroit’s  ability  to  reconnect  water  service  to  all \ndisconnected households.146 The letter urged the Governor to impose an indefinite \nmoratorium  on  shutoffs  and  implement  a  water  affordability  plan  based  on  a \nhousehold’s ability to pay. \n193.  During the COVID-19 pandemic, and as recently as June 26, 2020, \nmembers of the Coalition have regularly encountered and provided assistance to \nDetroit residents who were unaware of the Water Restart Plan and EO 2020-28 and \nhave not had their water restored during the health crisis.  \n194.  During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Coalition has sought to increase \nawareness of the importance of handwashing and the dangers of water shutoffs \nthrough billboards placed along Detroit freeways, including I-75, I-96, the Lodge \nFreeway, and the Southfield Freeway.147 \n \n146 Letter from People’s Water Board Coalition to Governor Gretchen Whitmer \n(Mar. 16, 2020), https://www.peopleswaterboard.org/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/03/PWB_AppealToWhitmer.pdf.  \n147 People’s Water Board, Billboards, \nhttps://www.peopleswaterboard.org/billboards/ (last visited July 8, 2020).  \n74 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-11860-DPH-APP   ECF No. 1, PageID.75   Filed 07/09/20   Page 75 of 101\n \n195.  The  Coalition  brought  on  four  organizers  during  the  pandemic  to \ncanvass Detroit neighborhoods and inform residents of the Water Restart Plan and \nEO 2020-28 to ensure that water is restored for all city residents.  \n196.  The  Coalition  has  provided  bottled  water  to  some  residents  living \nwithout water service during the COVID-19 pandemic, despite the Water Restart \nPlan and EO 2020-28.  \nCLASS ALLEGATIONS \n197.  Plaintiffs bring this case as a proposed class action under Federal Rules \nof Civil Procedure 23(a), 23(b)(2), and 23(b)(3). \n198.  Plaintiffs request that this Court certify four main classes as follows:  \na.  A class of all current and future Detroit residents who reside in, \nor live in close proximity to, neighborhoods where disease has \nspread widely and has caused high rates of infection because of \nsignificant numbers of water shutoffs (“Class A”);  \nb.  A class of all current and future DWSD customers who are or \nwill be at risk of becoming physically ill because they lack water \nservice or are “water insecure” (i.e., they may lose water service \nat any time because of their chronic poverty and inability to pay \nmarket rate fees for water) (“Class B”);  \nc.  A class of all residential DWSD customers who, within the last \n75 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-11860-DPH-APP   ECF No. 1, PageID.76   Filed 07/09/20   Page 76 of 101\n \ntwo years, have had their water service disconnected by Detroit \nfor non-payment without Detroit first determining whether they \nhad the means to pay and willfully refused to do so (“Class C”); \nand  \nd.  A class of all Black residents of Detroit who, within the last two \nyears, have had their water service disconnected by Detroit for \nnon-payment or are at risk losing water service once the city \nresumes shutoffs (“Class D”). \n199.  All Named Plaintiffs are members of Class A they seek to represent. \n200.  All Named Plaintiffs are members of Class B they seek to represent. \n201.  All Named Plaintiffs are members of Class C they seek to represent. \n202.  All Named Plaintiffs are members of Class D they seek to represent. \n203.  The  members  of  each  class  are  collectively  referred  to  as  “Class \nMembers.”  \n204.  Plaintiffs reserve the right to amend the definition of the above-defined \nclasses based on discovery or legal developments.  \n205.  This action is properly maintained as a class action because: \na.  Joinder of all Class Members is impracticable because of the size \nof each respective class or subclass. Upon information and belief, \neach class or subclass includes at least several hundred, if not \n76 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-11860-DPH-APP   ECF No. 1, PageID.77   Filed 07/09/20   Page 77 of 101\n \nseveral thousand, members.  \nb.  Defendants have acted or refused to act on grounds generally \napplicable to each respective class or subclass.  \nc.  Common questions of law and fact exist as to Class Members \nwithin each respective class or subclass and predominate over \nany questions affecting only individual members. Common legal \nand factual questions include but are not limited to: (i) the direct \nimpact of mass water shutoffs on the health or bodily integrity of \nall  members  of  the  Class;  (ii)  whether  Defendant  Detroit’s \npolicies and practices have a disparate impact on Black residents \nin violation of the FHA and ELCRA; (iii) whether any disparate \nimpact is justified by a substantial, legitimate, nondiscriminatory \ninterest; (iv) whether punitive damages for Class Members for \nDefendant Detroit’s violations of the FHA are warranted; and (v) \nwhether  a  declaratory  judgment  and/or  injunctive  relief  are \nwarranted regarding Defendants’ policies and practices. \nd.  Plaintiffs’ claims are typical of the claims of the classes they seek \nto represent.  \ne.  A  class  action  is  superior  to  the  other  available  methods  to \nadjudicate this litigation fairly and efficiently.  \n77 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-11860-DPH-APP   ECF No. 1, PageID.78   Filed 07/09/20   Page 78 of 101\n \nf.  There will be no difficulty in the management of this action as a \nclass  action.  Moreover,  judicial  economy  will  be  served  by \nmaintaining this lawsuit as a class action because it will likely \nprevent individual harmed persons from filing hundreds or even \nthousands of similar suits, which would otherwise burden the \njudicial system. There are no obstacles to effective and efficient \nmanagement of this lawsuit as a class action. \n206.

Plaintiffs, on behalf of themselves and Classes A and B, re-allege and \nre-plead all the allegations of the preceding and subsequent paragraphs of this \nComplaint and incorporate them herein by reference. \n78 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-11860-DPH-APP   ECF No. 1, PageID.79   Filed 07/09/20   Page 79 of 101\n \n208.  Plaintiffs  have  a  clearly  established  fundamental  right  to  bodily \nintegrity under the substantive due process guarantees the U.S. Constitution and the \nMichigan Constitution of 1963. \n209.  The  Due  Process  Clause  of  the  14th  Amendment  to  the  U.S. \nConstitution prohibits state and local governments from depriving individuals of life, \nliberty, or property without due process of the law.148  \n210.  42 U.S.C. § 1983 (“Section 1983”) allows individuals to bring actions \nagainst  state  actors,  including  municipalities,  for  deprivations  of  federal \nconstitutional  and  statutory  rights,  including  those  protected  by  the  14th \nAmendment.  \n211.  The Michigan Constitution of 1963 provides that “[n]o person shall be \n. . . deprived of life, liberty or property, without due process of law.”149  \n212.  The above conduct of Defendants Detroit, Duggan, and Brown has been \ntaken under color of state and local law.  \n213.  Defendants Detroit, Duggan, and Brown have persisted in the practice \nof employing water shutoffs as a collection method even though many households \nsubject  to  termination  cannot  afford  to  pay  market  rates  for  water  service.  In \n \n148 U.S. Const. amend. XIV, § 1, cl. 3. \n149 Mich. Const. 1963, Article I, § 17. \n79 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-11860-DPH-APP   ECF No. 1, PageID.80   Filed 07/09/20   Page 80 of 101\n \naddition, the lack of water service in many residents’ homes is humiliating to \nresidents because of Defendant Detroit’s practice of marking customers’ homes with \nbright blue paint when their water service is or is about to be disconnected, which \nleads to the stigmatization of residents. \n214.  In response to public complaints that a high poverty rate in Detroit \nguarantees widespread termination of water service, Defendants have established or \nused ineffective water assistance programs, which ensure a chronic lack of access to \nwater to low income families. These include the 10-30-50 program and WRAP.  \n215.  The inability of many families to pay for water service has led to an \nincreasing number of water disconnections for non-payment by DWSD.  \n216.  This lack of water service contributes to the spread of disease in the \nCity of Detroit, including infections of COVID-19.  \n217.  By establishing the Water Restart Plan, Defendants Detroit, Duggan, \nand Brown effectively admitted the correlation between the lack of water service \nand the spread of disease. \n218.  Upon information and belief, Defendants Detroit, Duggan, and Brown \nwere out of compliance with EO 2020-28 and are now out of compliance with EO \n2020-144 because there are residents of Detroit who previously had their water \nservice  disconnected  for  non-payment  and  have  not  been  restored  during  the \nCOVID-19 pandemic.  \n80 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-11860-DPH-APP   ECF No. 1, PageID.81   Filed 07/09/20   Page 81 of 101\n \n219.  In the face of a pandemic, the absence of an affordability plan, and a \nhigh death toll, Defendant Duggan has stated that he plans to resume the use of water \nshutoffs as a collection method after the coronavirus crisis has passed. This places \nDetroit residents at risk of infection from various diseases and other health problems \nthat result from the lack of water.  \n220.  Plaintiffs and Classes A and B derive from the 14th Amendment a \nfundamental liberty interest in personal security that includes their right to be free \nfrom  any  arbitrary  bodily  punishment  that  strips  them  of  the  essence  of  their \npersonhood. This includes the right to be free of disease from the lack of water \nservice. \n221.  Defendants Detroit, Duggan, and Brown breached the constitutionally \nprotected  bodily  integrity  of  Plaintiffs  and  Classes  A  and  B  by  continuing  to \nimplement  their  water  shutoff  policy  in  deliberate  indifference  to  the  known \ncorrelation between disease and the lack of water service. \n222.  Defendants Detroit, Duggan, and Brown violated the bodily integrity \nof Plaintiffs and Classes A and B by causing conditions leading to the introduction \nof infectious disease into their bodies, and/or by increasing the substantial likelihood \nthat such will occur. \n223.  Defendants’ water shutoff policy shocks the conscience and violates the \nsubstantive due process rights of Plaintiffs and Classes A and B.   \n81 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-11860-DPH-APP   ECF No. 1, PageID.82   Filed 07/09/20   Page 82 of 101\n \n224.  The infringement of Plaintiffs’ rights by Defendants Detroit, Duggan, \nand Brown is ongoing and likely to continue into the future. \nCOUNT TWO \nViolation of Substantive Due Process \nU.S. Constitution, Amendment XIV, 42 U.S.C. § 1983 \nAll Plaintiffs against Defendant Gretchen Whitmer \n225.  Plaintiffs, on behalf of themselves and Classes A and B, re-allege and \nre-plead all the allegations of the preceding  and subsequent paragraphs of this \nComplaint and incorporate them herein by reference. \n226.  Plaintiffs  have  a  clearly  established  fundamental  right  to  bodily \nintegrity under the substantive due process guarantee of the U.S. Constitution. \n227.  The  Due  Process  Clause  of  the  14th  Amendment  to  the  U.S. \nConstitution prohibits state governments from depriving individuals of life, liberty, \nor property without due process of the law.150  \n228.  Section 1983 allows individuals to bring actions against state actors for \ndeprivations of federal constitutional and statutory rights, including those protected \nby the 14th Amendment.  \n229.  The above conduct of Defendant Whitmer has been taken under color \nof state and local law.  \n230.  Pursuant  to  the  Michigan  Emergency  Management  Act,  Defendant \n \n150 U.S. Const. amend. XIV, § 1, cl. 3. \n82 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-11860-DPH-APP   ECF No. 1, PageID.83   Filed 07/09/20   Page 83 of 101\n \nWhitmer has a duty to address public emergencies. The Act provides that “[t]he \ngovernor is responsible for coping with dangers to this state or the people of this \nstate  presented  by  a  disaster  or  emergency.”151  The  Act  also  grants  Governor \nWhitmer the authority and capacity to direct local authorities to use local resources \nto cope with a disaster or emergency.152  \n231.  For years, long before the current pandemic, the City of Detroit has \nexperienced an ongoing public health emergency due to its water shutoff policy, \nbecause the lack of water service in many residents’ homes leads to disease and the \npotential for disease.  \n232.  During  the  early  weeks  of  2020,  the  inadequacy  of  the  10-30-50 \nprogram and WRAP to assist Detroit’s water insecure population exacerbated the \nvulnerability of those residents to COVID-19 infection and other diseases due to \ntheir inability to wash their hands, bathe, flush their toilets, and clean their homes. \n233.  Defendant Whitmer has not only a responsibility to address public \nhealth emergencies, but she also has the authority and capacity to direct local \nauthorities to use local resources to address these problems pursuant to the Michigan \nEmergency Management Act.  \n \n151 Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. § 30.403(1). \n152 Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. § 30.405(1)(b), (j). \n83 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-11860-DPH-APP   ECF No. 1, PageID.84   Filed 07/09/20   Page 84 of 101\n \n234.  Defendant  Whitmer’s  willingness  in  March  2020  to  ensure  water \navailability for the people of Detroit was prompted solely by the statewide threat \nposed by COVID-19. As late as February 2020, Defendant Whitmer refused a \nrequest that she use her authority to require the reconnection of water service for \nthose in Detroit who were disconnected for non-payment even though it was clear \nthat Detroit residents faced a severe ongoing threat to public health that pre-dated \nthe arrival of COVID-19. \n235.  On March 28, 2020, Defendant Whitmer issued EO 2020-28. The order \nrequired public water utilities in Michigan to restore water service to occupied \nresidences where water service was shut off due to non-payment. On July 8, 2020, \nEO 2020-28 was replaced by EO 2020-144, which requires the reconnection of water \nservice for residents through the end of 2020.  \n236.  In  EOs  2020-28  and  2020-144,  Defendant  Whitmer  explicitly \nacknowledged the correlation between the lack of water and disease by stating \n“[n]ow more than ever, the provision of clean water to residences is essential to \nhuman health and hygiene, and to the public health and safety of this state.”153 \n237.  Defendant Whitmer also has a duty under the Michigan Emergency \nManagement Act to ensure full compliance with her executive orders. However, \n \n153 Mich. Exec. Order 2020-28, supra note 20, at 1; Mich. Exec. Order 2020-144, \nsupra note 21, at 2. \n84 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-11860-DPH-APP   ECF No. 1, PageID.85   Filed 07/09/20   Page 85 of 101\n \nupon information and belief, she took no action to ensure that Detroit and other \nmunicipalities within Michigan complied with EO 2020-28. Upon information and \nbelief, Defendants Detroit, Duggan, and Brown were out of compliance with EO \n2020-28 and are now out of compliance with EO 2020-144 because there were and \nare residents of Detroit who previously had their water service disconnected for non-\npayment and have not been restored during the COVID-19 pandemic.  \n238.  Because Defendant Duggan has stated his intention to resume the use \nof water shutoffs as a collection method, Defendant Whitmer must ensure either that \nwater shutoffs will not occur or that water shutoffs will not cause another public \nhealth emergency of the type that existed prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. This can \nhappen  through  a  permanent  ban  on  water  shutoffs  and/or  the  institution  of  a \nmeaningful water affordability program that will ensure water is affordable and \navailable to all, including Detroit’s water insecure population. \n239.  Defendant Whitmer issued EOs 2020-28 and 2020-144 in light of the \nongoing health impacts of the pandemic. Her evaluation of the need for these orders \nnecessarily involved an examination of the ongoing health risks posed by COVID-\n19,  including  infection  rates,  deaths,  and  other  conditions.  Because  of  the \nGovernor’s broader responsibility under the Michigan Emergency Management Act \nto  address  all  public  health  emergencies,  she  is  also  required  to  consider  the \ninevitable adverse public health consequences of the planned resumption of water \n85 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-11860-DPH-APP   ECF No. 1, PageID.86   Filed 07/09/20   Page 86 of 101\n \nshutoffs, even after the expiration of EO 2020-144 or any subsequent order requiring \nthe restoration of water service during the COVID-19 pandemic.  \n240.  Upon information and belief, water shutoffs in Detroit will resume \nwhen the immediate threat of COVID-19 has passed. If there is no permanent ban \non  water  shutoffs  and  the  institution  of  a  water  affordability  plan  for  Detroit \nresidents, other public health dangers of the kind that predated COVID-19 and that \nhave always been caused by water shutoffs will remain. Because of Defendant \nWhitmer’s obligation to address all public health emergencies, she is obligated to \nensure water availability for all persons after the immediate threat of COVID-19 has \npassed.   \n241.  Despite this responsibility, Defendant Whitmer made clear in EO 2020-\n144 that the order does not relieve a customer of the obligation to pay for water, \nprevent a public water supply from charging any customer for water service, or \nreduce the amount a resident may owe to a public water supply.154 \n242.  As of the date of this filing, Defendant Whitmer has used her authority \nto make water available after the expiration of EO 2020-144 only to support water \nassistance programs that are ineffective and that do not ensure the availability of \nwater to Detroit’s water insecure population. Specifically, she sought increased \n \n154 Mich. Exec. Order 2020-144, supra note 21, at 2. \n86 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-11860-DPH-APP   ECF No. 1, PageID.87   Filed 07/09/20   Page 87 of 101\n \nfunding for WRAP shortly before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and also \nsupported the passage of SB 690, which will establish a statewide fund of $25 \nmillion to assist water utilities with arrearages incurred by customers during the \npandemic. This fund is limited to $700 in assistance for eligible households and only \ncovers arrearages and fees incurred during the COVID-19 state of emergency. Like \nthe 10-30-50 program and WRAP, this fund will not address the ongoing or long-\nterm water needs of Detroit’s water insecure population.  \n243.  Defendant Whitmer is fully knowledgeable of the inadequacy of this \nwater  assistance  fund  and  other  water  assistance  programs.  She  has  used  the \nauthority of her office to solely sustain or facilitate creation of water assistance \nprograms that do not address the needs of Detroit’s water insecure population, rather \nthan require the establishment of an effective water affordability program. This \ndecision constitutes an affirmative act to create or increase the risk of harm to \nPlaintiffs. In the absence of an emergency order or a water affordability program, \nDetroit’s water insecure population will lose the ability to wash their hands, bathe, \nflush their toilets, and clean their homes once Detroit resumes its water shutoff \npolicy.  \n244.  Defendant Whitmer knows or should know that the resumption of water \nshutoffs in Detroit and the lack of a water affordability plan for Detroit residents will \nresult in the increased risk to Plaintiffs of infection from COVID-19 and other \n87 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-11860-DPH-APP   ECF No. 1, PageID.88   Filed 07/09/20   Page 88 of 101\n \ndiseases, due to the lack of water for handwashing and cleaning purposes. Defendant \nWhitmer’s decision to rely solely upon water assistance programs that provide \nlimited relief will not address the needs of Detroit’s water insecure population. \n245.  Plaintiffs  derive  from  the  14th  Amendment  a  fundamental  liberty \ninterest in personal security that includes their right to be free from any arbitrary \nbodily punishment that strips them of the essence of their personhood. This includes \nthe right to be free of disease from the lack of water service.  \n246.  Defendant Whitmer’s actions constitute a state-created danger resulting \nfrom the Governor’s deliberate indifference to the threat of violation of Plaintiffs’ \nbodily integrity. \n247.  Defendant Whitmer’s actions will violate Plaintiffs’ bodily integrity by \ncausing  conditions  leading  to  the  introduction  of  infectious  disease  into  the \nPlaintiffs’ bodies, and/or the substantial likelihood that such will occur. \n248.  Because of the information available to Defendant Whitmer, her failure \nto use her authority under the Michigan Emergency Management Act to permanently \nban water shutoffs and institute a water affordability plan for Detroit residents will \nbe acts taken after careful, protracted contemplation of the threat posed by mass \nwater shutoffs to the bodily integrity of Plaintiffs. These acts shock the conscience \nand will violate the substantive due process rights of Plaintiffs. \n88 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-11860-DPH-APP   ECF No. 1, PageID.89   Filed 07/09/20   Page 89 of 101\n \n249.  The infringement of Plaintiffs’ rights by Defendant Whitmer is ongoing \nand likely to continue into the future. \nCOUNT THREE \nViolation of Equal Protection \nU.S. Constitution, Amendment XIV, 42 U.S.C. § 1983; Michigan Constitution \nof 1963, Article I, § 2 \nAll Plaintiffs against Defendant City of Detroit \n \n250.  Plaintiffs, on behalf of themselves and Class C, re-allege and re-plead \nall the allegations of the preceding and subsequent paragraphs of this Complaint and \nincorporate them herein by reference. \n251.  The  Equal  Protection  Clause  of  the  14th  Amendment  to  the  U.S. \nConstitution prohibits state and local governments from denying to any person \nwithin  their  jurisdiction  the  equal  protection  of  the  laws.155  This  includes  a \nprohibition  against  state  actions  that  punish  individuals  for  non-payment  of \nmunicipal services without first considering whether the individual had the ability \nto pay and whether non-payment was willful.  \n252.  Section 1983 allows individuals to bring actions against state actors, \nincluding municipalities, for deprivations of federal constitutional and statutory \nrights, including those protected by the 14th Amendment.  \n \n155 U.S. Const. amend. XIV, § 1. cl. 4. \n89 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-11860-DPH-APP   ECF No. 1, PageID.90   Filed 07/09/20   Page 90 of 101\n \n253.  The Michigan Constitution of 1963 provides that “[n]o person shall be \ndenied the equal protection of the laws; nor shall any person be denied the enjoyment \nof his civil or political rights or be discriminated against in the exercise thereof \nbecause of religion, race, color or national origin.”156  \n254.  The above conduct of Defendant Detroit has been taken under color of \nstate and local law.  \n255.  DWSD’s Interim Rules and/or Customer Policies do not provide a \nmethod by which to determine whether a customer has the means to pay their bill \nprior to a disconnection of water service. \n256.  Plaintiffs and Class C have a substantial interest in their water service, \nas water is necessary for human survival, especially in the midst of a pandemic where \nwater  is  critical  to  stop  the  spread  of  COVID-19  and  other  bacterial  or  viral \ninfections through frequent handwashing and cleaning.  \n257.  Plaintiffs and Class C have a constitutionally protected property interest \nin the continuation of their residential water service.  \n258.  Defendant  Detroit’s  practice  of  disconnecting  water  service  to \nresidential account holders in ways that are humiliating and threaten public health \n \n156 Mich. Const. 1963, Article I, § 2. \n90 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-11860-DPH-APP   ECF No. 1, PageID.91   Filed 07/09/20   Page 91 of 101\n \nconstitutes a violation of the equal protection guarantees of the 14th Amendment to \nthe U.S. Constitution and the Michigan Constitution of 1963. \n259.  Defendant  Detroit’s  practice  of  disconnecting  water  service  to \nresidential account holders in a manner that has a disproportionate impact on the \ncity’s Black residents constitutes a violation of the equal protection guarantees of \nthe 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and the Michigan Constitution of \n1963. \n260.  Defendant  Detroit  does  not  reasonably  further  any  legitimate \ngovernment interest in collecting unpaid water debt by disconnecting the water \nservice of predominately Black residential customers who do not have the means to \npay because they are indigent, through no fault of their own, at great risk to public \nhealth and societal costs. \n261.  Defendant  Detroit  does  not  reasonably  further  any  legitimate \ngovernment interest in collecting unpaid water debt by disconnecting the water \nservice of predominately Black residential customers who do not have the means to \npay because they are indigent, through no fault of their own, especially in light of \nthe COVID-19 pandemic, as the disconnection of water service will result in the \nincreased risk of infection from COVID-19 and other diseases.  \n262.  Defendant  Detroit  does  not  reasonably  further  any  legitimate \ngovernment interest in collecting unpaid water debt by disconnecting the water \n91 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-11860-DPH-APP   ECF No. 1, PageID.92   Filed 07/09/20   Page 92 of 101\n \nservice of predominately Black residential customers who do not have a means to \npay because they are indigent, through no fault of their own, as the city is likely to \nsuffer  even  greater  economic  losses  associated  with  an  increase  in  COVID-19 \ninfections, including  but not limited to increased hospitalizations and a further \ndecrease in tax revenue that will result from a prolonged uncontrolled pandemic. \n263.  Defendant  Detroit  does  not  reasonably  further  any  legitimate \ngovernment interest in collecting unpaid water debt by disconnecting the water \nservice of predominately Black residential customers who do not have a means to \npay because they are indigent, through no fault of their own, as such a policy does \nnot make it more likely that the city will recover its costs from indigent residents \nwho are truly unable to pay their arrearages.  \n264.  Defendant  Detroit  does  not  reasonably  further  any  legitimate \ngovernment interest in collecting unpaid water debt through the implementation of \nthe 10-30-50 program and WRAP, as DWSD continues to disconnect water service \nto tens of thousands of predominately Black residents each year, which demonstrates \nthe ineffectiveness of the programs in maintaining service and collecting unpaid \nwater debt.  \n265.  There are more reasonable means for Defendant Detroit to accomplish \nits interest in collecting unpaid water debt, including by reducing or forgiving the \namount  owed  and/or  establishing  a  water  affordability  program  that  takes  a \n92 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-11860-DPH-APP   ECF No. 1, PageID.93   Filed 07/09/20   Page 93 of 101\n \ncustomer’s level of income into account and ability to pay into account prior to the \ndisconnection of water service. These alternative means of collecting unpaid water \ndebt without disconnecting water service would pose no public health threat or result \nin significant societal costs, such as the loss of life, livelihoods, or to the city’s tax \nrevenue during a prolonged and uncontrolled pandemic.   \n266.  DWSD’s Interim Rules and/or Customer Policies violate the equal \nprotection rights of Plaintiffs and Class C under the U.S. and Michigan Constitutions \nbecause they authorize the disconnection of a customer’s water service without first \ndetermining whether the customer has the ability to pay and is willfully refusing to \ndo so.  \n267.  The infringement of Plaintiffs’ rights by Defendant Detroit is ongoing \nand likely to continue into the future. \nCOUNT FOUR \nRace Discrimination Under the Fair Housing Act \n42 U.S.C. §§ 3601 et seq. \nAll Plaintiffs against Defendant City of Detroit  \n \n268.

Defendant Detroit’s water shutoff policy has been in place for years and \nhas been temporarily halted due to the city’s Water Restart Plan and EOs 2020-28 \nand 2020-144. Upon information and belief, water shutoffs in Detroit will resume \nwhen the immediate threat of COVID-19 has passed. \n271.  By the actions described throughout this Complaint, Defendant Detroit \nhas violated, and continues to violate, the rights of Plaintiffs and Class D under the \nFHA, 42 U.S.C. §§ 3601 et seq. and implementing regulations by discriminating on \nthe basis of race in the terms, conditions, or privileges of the provision of services \nor facilities of a dwelling, in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 3604(b) and implementing \nregulations. \n272.  By the actions described throughout this Complaint, Defendant Detroit \nhas engaged in, and will continue to engage in, a policy, pattern, and practice of \ndiscrimination against Black residents of Detroit due to their race, or the racial \ncomposition of their neighborhood, in violation of the FHA.  \n273.  The past and continuing acts and conduct of Defendant Detroit have \nhad and will continue to have a harmful disparate impact on Black residents of \nDetroit, in violation of the federally protected rights of Plaintiffs and Class D.   \n274.

Plaintiffs and Class D have no plain, adequate, or complete remedy at \nlaw to redress the wrongs alleged herein, and the relief sought in this action is the \nonly means of securing complete and adequate relief. The policy identified above \nhas been in place for several years, and Defendant Detroit plans to continue this \ndiscriminatory action by immediately resuming water shutoffs. Plaintiffs and Class \nD  have  suffered,  and  will  continue  to  suffer,  irreparable  injury  from  the \ndiscriminatory actions of Defendant Detroit. \n276.  With the exception of the current period where Detroit has been banned \nfrom disconnecting water service to residents for non-payment, Defendant Detroit \nhas maintained these acts, policies, and practices continuously, and they constitute a \ncontinuing violation of 42 U.S.C. §§ 3601 et seq.  \n277.  Defendant Detroit’s discriminatory policy is an artificial, arbitrary, and \nunnecessary barrier to housing. \n278.  Defendant Detroit’s discriminatory policy is not justified by one or \nmore substantial, legitimate, nondiscriminatory interests.

By the actions described throughout this Complaint, Defendant Detroit \nhas engaged in, and will continue to engage in, a policy, pattern, and practice of \ndiscrimination against Black residents of Detroit due to their race, or the racial \ncomposition of their neighborhood, in violation of ELCRA.  \n283.  The past and continuing acts and conduct of Defendant Detroit have \nhad and will continue to have a harmful disparate impact on Black residents of \n96 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-11860-DPH-APP   ECF No. 1, PageID.97   Filed 07/09/20   Page 97 of 101\n \nDetroit, in violation of the protected rights of Plaintiffs and Class D.   \n284.  Defendant  Detroit’s  discriminatory  policy  of  disconnecting  water \nservice to customers has harmed and will continue to harm Plaintiffs and Class D, \nand constitutes unlawful discrimination on the basis of race in violation of ELCRA, \nMich. Comp. Laws Ann. § 37.2502. \n285.  Plaintiffs and Class D have no plain, adequate, or complete remedy at \nlaw to redress the wrongs alleged herein, and the relief sought in this action is the \nonly means of securing complete and adequate relief. The policy identified above \nhas been in place for several years, and Defendant Detroit plans to continue this \ndiscriminatory action by immediately resuming water shutoffs. Plaintiffs and Class \nD  currently  suffer,  and  will  continue  to  suffer,  irreparable  injury  from  the \ndiscriminatory actions of Defendant Detroit. \n286.  Defendant Detroit has maintained these acts, policies, and practices \ncontinuously, and they constitute a continuing violation of ELCRA.  \n287.  Defendant Detroit’s discriminatory policy is an artificial, arbitrary, and \nunnecessary barrier to housing. \n288.  Defendant Detroit’s discriminatory policy is not justified by one or \nmore substantial, legitimate, nondiscriminatory interests. To the extent Detroit may \nclaim  that  its  policy  is  justified  by  a  substantial,  legitimate,  nondiscriminatory \ninterest, that interest may be achieved by less discriminatory means. \n97 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-11860-DPH-APP   ECF No. 1, PageID.98   Filed 07/09/20   Page 98 of 101\n \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs and Class Members pray for relief as follows: \na.
