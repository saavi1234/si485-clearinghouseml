    "summary": "<p>This is a case about the accessibility of the City of Chelsea, Michigan to those with mobility impairments. On April 28. 2016, nine individuals with mobility impairments and the Ann Arbor Center for Independent Living, Inc. filed this class action lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan. The plaintiffs sued the City of Chelsea, Chelsea Downtown Development Authority, and the Michigan Department of Transportation under the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Rehabilitation Act, and Michigan&rsquo;s Persons with Disabilities Civil Rights Act. Represented by private counsel, the plaintiffs sought declarative relief and attorneys fees. The plaintiffs also sought a final injunction prohibiting each defendant from violating the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Rehabilitation Act, and the Chelsea defendants from violating Michigan&rsquo;s Persons with Disabilities Civil Rights Act. The plaintiffs requested an injunction ordering the defendants to correct the access barriers according to law. They claimed that Chelsea&rsquo;s streets and walks are not readily accessible to and usable by them, and new barriers to access were being created. They have difficulty on the sidewalks, with parking, and attending parades and festivals. The case was assigned to District Judge David M. Lawson.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On April 4, 2016 an amended complaint was filed changing a minor plaintiff from their full name to initials and clarifying their desire for final injunctive relief.</p>\r\n<p>On April 1, 2016 the City of Chelsea filed a third party complaint by against the Washtenaw County Road Commission and an amended complaint April 5. The City of Chelsea alleged the responsibility for regulating and maintaining one of the main roadways that is the locale of certain alleged accessibility defects described in the complaint rests entirely with the Washtenaw County Road Commission. The City of Chelsea requested that the Washtenaw County Road Commission respond to any relief granted to the defendants regarding that roadway.</p>\r\n<p>In October the Washtenaw County Road Commission moved for judgment on the pleadings. In November the Michigan Department of Transportation moved to dismiss and the Chelsea defendants and the plaintiffs entered a consent decree and partial settlement.</p>\r\n<p>In January of 2017 Judge Lawson held a motion hearing. On May 19, 2017 Judge Lawson denied both the defendants&rsquo; motion for judgment on the pleadings and motion to dismiss, and granted plaintiffs' motion to amend the complaint and joint motion to approve the consent decree.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Judge Lawson found the pleadings stated plausible claims against all of the public entities under the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Rehabilitation Act. The Michigan Department of Transportation and the Washtenaw County Road Commission argued the plaintiffs must allege they were denied a service by a facility due to inaccessibility. However, the plaintiffs had claimed they were unable safely to navigate the sidewalks and have been denied the full enjoyment and benefit of public services such as municipal parking, parades, and festivals. The defendants had worked on sidewalks, curbs, and parking spaces without following statutory requirements regarding accessibility. The Michigan Department of Transportation and the Washtenaw County Road Commission also argued only the city was liable as the provider of the services. Judge Lawson found the Americans with Disabilities Act makes no distinction between the entity responsible for causing an obstruction and the entity that provides a service that is obstructed by accessibility defects.</p>\r\n<p>Judge Lawson also found that bringing the Washtenaw County Road Commission into the dispute as a main defendant clarified the issues, properly aligned the parties, and would not prejudice anyone. The plaintiffs&rsquo; motion to amend the complaint to include the Washtenaw County Road Commission was granted. The amended complaint was filed five days after Judge Lawson&rsquo;s ruling.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs and the Chelsea defendants reached a settlement presented as a proposed consent decree. The Michigan Department of Transportation took no position on that request, but the Washtenaw County Road Commission opposed it. They argued the claims in the amended complaint were without merit, the proposed settlement agreement is ambiguous and indefinite in scope, and entry of the consent decree may impair their ability to defend against the complaints. Judge Lawson found the consent decree only binds the parties in it and there was no good reason not to allow the settlement between the Chelsea defendants and the plaintiffs. 252 F.Supp.3d 642.</p>\r\n<p>Judge Lawson signed the first consent decree between the plaintiffs and the Chelsea defendants on August 4, 2017. The Chelsea defendants agreed that all future construction and alterations be accessible by individuals with disabilities, unless technically infeasible. The Chelsea defendants would file annual reports of compliance listing each facility or portion of facility constructed or altered including its location and physical limits. The report would also include where new curb ramps or other sloped areas have been installed or removed as part of the projects. The Chelsea defendants agreed to file another report of all the same details of each facility built between 1992 and 2016. The prior report will include if the facilities meet the standards for each year and the Chelsea defendants&rsquo; intent to replace any non-conforming facility. It would list all missing ramps or sloped areas. The plaintiffs and the Chelsea defendants would use the report to determine what shall be replaced and file a second consent decree. The parties also agreed to comply with any changes in future standards. The Chelsea defendants agreed to pay $30,000 in attorney fees and costs and the initial term of the decree was for five years.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>In April of 2017 the Michigan Department of Transportation and the Washtenaw County Road Commission both moved for summary judgment and the City of Chelsea moved for partial summary judgment. In August, Judge Lawson held a motion hearing and January 2, 2018 issued an order. Judge Lawson granted the Michigan Department of Transportation&rsquo;s motion for summary judgment, granted in part and denied in part the Washtenaw County Road Commission&rsquo;s motion for summary judgment, and denied the City of Chelsea&rsquo;s motion for summary judgment.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The Michigan Department of Transportation claimed Eleventh Amendment immunity as a state agency barred from suit in a federal court. Judge Lawson pointed out the plaintiffs could easily amend their complaint to name the state agency&rsquo;s highest official and congress removed state&rsquo;s sovereign immunity in Title II of the ADA. However, the plaintiffs&rsquo; claims were dismissed because they have failed to submit adequate, prospectively admissible information to establish the existence of defects in the sidewalks which violated the regulations.</p>\r\n<p>Judge Lawson found, contrary to the Washtenaw County Road Commission&rsquo;s motion for summary judgment, that sidewalks functioned as both facilities and services, and that the plaintiffs had pointed out specific instances of inaccessibility and defects within the statute of limitations. The Ann Arbor Center for Independent Living, Inc. established standing by showing that they had to divert resources to secure compliance by the defendants. The Washtenaw County Road Commission also argued the defects were due to improper maintenance, for which they weren&rsquo;t responsible. Judge Lawson found that they did not submit any evidence to support the defects weren&rsquo;t due to their construction. However, the plaintiffs&rsquo; claims based on the alleged elimination of a pair of curb ramps at some intersections was dismissed; those instances were where the sidewalk does not intersect with the roadway, as required by law.</p>\r\n<p>The City of Chelsea moved for summary judgment against the Washtenaw County Road Commission, but Michigan law imposed a duty on the city to maintain sidewalks. The Americans with Disabilities Act also imposed an express requirement on a responsible public entity to maintain in operable working condition facilities and equipment that are required to be readily usable by persons with disabilities. 284 F.Supp.3d 863</p>\r\n<p>On January 23, 2018 costs were taxed for $3,891.55 against the plaintiffs for the Michigan Department of Transportation.</p>\r\n<p>On June 19, 2018 the City of Chelsea released its first annual report per their consent decree. They identified all the facilities covered by the first consent decree and notified the court they intend to remedy all curb ramps constructed after 2007.</p>\r\n<p>May 28 through June 1, 2018 the parties had a bench trial with Judge Lawson. July 3, 2019 Judge Lawson filed his opinion after the trial. Standing was again challenged. The Ann Arbor Center for Independent Living, Inc. maintained standing for the same reason previously decided, they had devoted significant resources. The individual plaintiffs also showed standing, as they had a significant possibility of future harm due to the faulty construction, and ordering compliance would likely redress the injury.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs showed that the Washtenaw County Road Commission&rsquo;s construction of curb ramps failed to comply with the statutes. They must rework the offending curb ramps to improve drainage and to eliminate the incidence of standing water and the deposits of debris on the curb ramps. While the City of Chelsea issues permits for the Washtenaw County Road Commission, they had no inspection obligation concerning the project. Judge Lawson held the City of Chelsea was not liable for any resulting defects. While the Washtenaw County Road Commission alleged the City of Chelsea ought to maintain the curb ramps clear of water and debris, Judge Lawson found the problem was due to their construction.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Judge Lawson entered judgment for injunctive and declaratory relief against the Washtenaw County Road Commission, finding their facilities discriminated against the plaintiffs and failed to provide access for persons with disabilities as required by law and they shall be promptly fixed. Accordingly, the third party complaint was dismissed as moot. Except as to the claims addressed by the consent judgment, the claims against the Chelsea defendants were dismissed. 391 F.Supp.3d 720</p>\r\n<p>The Washtenaw County Road Commission appealed to the Sixth Circuit July 30, 2019, but voluntarily dismissed their appeal October 10, 2019 after a private settlement with plaintiffs. 2019 WL 7834248.</p>\r\n<p>On July 15, 2019 the City of Chelsea released its second annual report and on September 8, 2020 they released their third annual report per their consent decree. In each they described what they had constructed the last year and planned to construct.</p>\r\n<p>On December 14, 2020 the plaintiffs and the Chelsea defendants entered their second consent decree. The city of Chelsea had performed all its obligations under the first settlement agreement. However, it had identified hundreds of defective curbs ramps and had corrected approximately twenty. They would file a report on which curb ramps would be technically infeasible to remedy and negotiate a timetable for repair in a third consent decree. The City of Chelsea was ordered to ensure a list accessible parking spaces. The Chelsea defendants were to pay $10,836.15 in costs and attorney fees.</p>\r\n<p>The terms of the second consent decree were in force until August 4, 2022. This case is now believed to be closed.</p>",

MOTE, DEBORAH CLARK,\nCARLOS GRAY-LION, BRENDA BARANIAK,\nKAREN STREET, MERLYN STREET,\nLEE BENTON, by his next friends RONALD M.\nBENTON and MARION BENTON, J.N., a minor, Case Number 16-11546\nby his next friends DANIEL and MARY JANE Honorable David M. Lawson\nNELSON, ANN ARBOR CENTER FOR\nINDEPENDENT LIVING, INC., and\nJENNIFER KUNDAK,\nPlaintiffs,\nv.\nCITY OF CHELSEA, CHELSEA DOWNTOWN\nDEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY, MICHIGAN\nDEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION, and\nWASHTENAW COUNTY ROAD COMMISSION,\nDefendants,\nand\nCITY OF CHELSEA,\nThird-party plaintiff,\nv.\nWASHTENAW COUNTY ROAD COMMISSION,\nThird-party defendant.\n___________________________________________/\nOPINION AND ORDER GRANTING MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT BY\nDEFENDANT MICHIGAN DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION, GRANTING IN\nPART AND DENYING IN PART MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT BY\nDEFENDANT WASHTENAW COUNTY ROAD COMMISSION, DENYING MOTION\nFOR RECONSIDERATION BY DEFENDANT MICHIGAN DEPARTMENT OF\nTRANSPORTATION, DENYING MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT BY\nDEFENDANT CITY OF CHELSEA, AND ORDERING STATUS CONFERENCE  \n\nThis case is before the Court again on the second round of dispositive motions in this\nmunicipal sidewalk accessibility dispute brought under the Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA),\nthe Rehabilitation Act, and their state-law counterpart.  The Court previously denied motions to\ndismiss  filed  by  defendants  Washtenaw  County  Road  Commission  (WCRC)  and  Michigan\nDepartment of Transportation (MDOT).  Mote v. City of Chelsea, 252 F. Supp. 3d 642 (E.D. Mich.\n2017).  The plaintiffs since have filed a second amended complaint, and discovery has closed. \nDefendants WCRC and MDOT now have filed motions for summary judgment, presenting many\nof the same legal arguments raised and rejected earlier.  Each defendant has raised additional\narguments, however, some of which merit dismissal of part of the plaintiffs’ claims.  The Court will\ngrant in part and deny in part the defendants’ motions for summary judgment.   \nI.\nThe plaintiffs are individual disabled persons, who live, work, or frequently travel to and\nwithin the City of Chelsea, Michigan, and who each require the use of a wheelchair, braces, cane,\nor other assistive devices in order to get around, along with the Ann Arbor Center for Independent\nLiving (AACIL), which is an association that represents disabled persons such as the plaintiffs\nthroughout southeastern Michigan, including in Chelsea.  Together, and on behalf of persons\nsimilarly situated, the plaintiffs complain that the public streets and sidewalks in the City of Chelsea\nare less than fully accessible, at least in part because of construction and renovation work done on\npublic sidewalks and streets by the City of Chelsea, the WCRC, and MDOT, which either removed,\nomitted, or improperly constructed accessibility features.  The plaintiffs also initially complained\nabout accessible public parking, but they have not developed those claims and appear to have\nabandoned them.  \n-2-\n\nThe parties have furnished drawings and diagrams of some of the intersections.  Their “Ramp\nLocation Index” identifies each intersection’s potential ramp location with ordinal numbers “1”\nthrough “8,” beginning with the northwest corner of an intersection — ramp “1” is the south-facing\nlocation — then proceeding clockwise until the southwest corner, with “8” being the north-facing\nlocation.  (In the case of a “T” intersection, at least two of the ordinal locations would be\ninapplicable.).  Those designation will be used here.  The following fact summary is taken from the\nparties’ affidavits, declarations, and authenticated documents.  We begin with the circumstances of\nthe individual and institutional plaintiffs.  \nA.  Individual Plaintiffs\n1.  Shauna Mote\nIn 2005, plaintiff Shauna Mote was in a car accident, and her injuries resulted in the\namputation of both her legs.  She now uses an adapted van with hand controls for transportation,\nwhich has a side fold-out ramp that she uses to exit the vehicle.  Before her accident, she never used\nthe sidewalks or curb ramps along US-12, but in 2015 a new friend suggested to her that a good way\nto meet people was to participate in the fairs and parades held in town.  In August 2016 Mote\nattempted to travel the pedestrian route along US-12 for the first time, in order to meet with her\nfriend for the “Old 12 Childrens Fair Parade.”  She also attempted to attend the “Chelsea Summer\nFair Children’s Parade” on an unspecified date in 2016.  While traveling the sidewalk route along\nUS-12, Mote observed several ramps with excessive running slopes, one of which was so steep that\nit caused the front wheels of her wheelchair to come up off the ground at the top.  She also found\nit hard to navigate the ramps across US-12; at one location an excessive cross-slope on the ramp\nalmost caused her to roll into traffic, and at another crossing police had to stop traffic to allow Mote\nand her friend to try to cross the street.  However, upon crossing the street Mote and her friend were\n-3-\n\n“confronted with a very steep curb ramp that was also covered with mud, weeds, and gravel several\ninches deep,” and as “a result we had to avoid that curb ramp entirely and use a different ramp,\nwhich forced us to travel along Old 12, with our police escort.”  On other occasions, Mote has found\nmany of the curb ramps to be flooded with water and mud, requiring her husband to push her\nwheelchair with great difficulty; Mote averred that she would not have been able to make the\npassage in her wheelchair without his aid.  As a result of these and other problems with the US-12\ncurb ramps, Mote has not been able to access the Lake Pierce Boardwalk either alone or with the\nassistance of friends.\nMote did not identify the specific intersections with the offending ramps.  \nAs to M-52, Mote attested only that there are no accessible or handicapped-placarded\nparking spaces anywhere in the street parking along M-52; the normal spaces marked out on that\nstreet do not have enough width to allow deployment of her van’s ramp; and, as a result, she has had\nto forego attending music festivals in town, or is forced to “park far away, and risk [her] health and\nsafety using the very inaccessible and unsafe curb ramps, street crossings and sidewalks along SR-52\n(Main Street).” \n2.  Deborah Clark\nPlaintiff Deborah Clark has a wheelchair-modified van and a motorized wheelchair that she\nuses to get around.  She first met friends who lived in Chelsea and visited there in 2014.   Before\nAugust 2014, she never had occasion to visit the City or use any of the sidewalks there.   In August\n2014 Clark attended the Chelsea Summer Fair Parade, which ran along US-12, and, after parking\nin an accessible space by the shopping mall, she used six curb ramps installed by defendant WCRC\nto reach a spot where she could view the parade.  The excessive slope on some of those ramps\n-4-\n\ncaused her wheelchair to tip, and gaps where some ramps met the sidewalk caused her wheels to get\nstuck, resulting in Clark having difficulty controlling her chair and her service dog.  In 2015 Clark\ndecided not to attend the parade, to avoid facing the same difficult trek.  \nIn 2015 or 2016, Clark learned that a new pedestrian crossing was installed across US-12\nleading to the Lake Pierce Boardwalk.  However, when it rains Clark has observed that the entire\ncross-walks and ramps are submerged and filled with pooled water and mud, which causes her\nwheelchair tires to lose traction, leaving her unable to traverse the ramps.  As a result, Clark was not\nable to access the boardwalk despite the new crossing.  \nIn 2016, Clark tried to attend one of the Thursday Night Sights and Sounds events in\ndowntown Chelsea with her friend, fellow plaintiff Brenda Baraniak.  The event features musical\nacts on ten stages arranged along M-52 (Main Street).  Clark attested that “[v]irtually every\ntransition from each crosswalk to and from each curb ramp had an abrupt change in level, (large\nlips) that risked tipping our wheelchairs”; almost “every painted crosswalk had one or more divots,\npotholes, rips or other defects in the road surface that were tipping hazards”; and a “few times we\nhad to go outside of the painted crosswalk, to find the least risky place to transition from the street\nonto or off of a curb ramp.”  Clark stated that “[a]t one location, we abandoned the crosswalks and\ncurb ramps entirely,” and instead “both traveled in heavy vehicular traffic and used a commercial\ndriveway apron to leave the street and enter onto the sidewalk, and later to leave the sidewalk and\nenter the traffic.”  As a result, Clark and Baraniak were able to get close to only two of the\nperforming stages, were unable to reach two others, and ended up giving up and going home without\nenjoying most of the festival.  \nAs with Ms. Mote, Clark did not identify the specific intersections with the offending ramps. \n-5-\n\n3.  Brenda Baraniak\nPlaintiff Brenda Baraniak is paralyzed from the waist down and uses a wheelchair that she\npushes by her own power.  She has a device that lifts the wheelchair and stores it on top of her car\nwhen she travels, and her car is modified to use hand controls.  Baraniak stated that she had not\nvisited Chelsea or used any of the pedestrian crossings there before August 2014.   However,\nsometime after July 2014, Baraniak believed her granddaughter had reached an age where she could\nenjoy the parades in Chelsea and decided to attend the Chelsea Community Fair and its associated\nparade along US-12.  Baraniak described nearly verbatim the same difficulties encountered by\nplaintiff Clark during her visit to the US-12 parade route.  She also described similar difficulties and\na lack of access to the Lake Pierce Boardwalk via the new pedestrian crosswalk across US-12, and\nshe  related  the  same  difficulties  encountered  while  attempting  unsuccessfully  to  attend  the\ndowntown music fair with Clark.  \n4.  Karen and Merlyn Street\nPlaintiff Karen Street lives in Chelsea, is a survivor of polio, and has trouble walking.  In\n2014 she had an orthotic brace made for her ankle to assist her, but she still has trouble ambulating. \nShe can walk for short distances, but she uses a motorized scooter to get around most of the time,\nand as her condition has worsened in recent years she has relied on her scooter more and more. \nBefore August 2015, she never had any reason to use the curb ramps or sidewalks along US-12.  But\nin January 2017 a friend of hers moved into a retirement home across US-12 from the Lake Pierce\nBoardwalk, and Street attested that she wants to visit the boardwalk with her friend, but has been\nunable due to the same flooding and debris accumulation at the US-12 crossing which was described\nby other plaintiffs.  Street also stated that in 2015 she attended one of the Thursday evening music\n-6-\n\nfestivals along M-52 in Chelsea, and while trying to negotiate a particularly dangerous transition\nfrom a curb ramp her scooter tipped over into traffic along the street.  Since that time Street and her\nhusband have taken the dangerous — but in her view less risky — alternative of passing along the\nstreet among parked cars and passing traffic, rather than risk tipping over again on that particular\ncurb ramp.   However, even by that risky avenue Street was unable to reach most of the stages\nduring the festival, due to the number of curb ramps that she found dangerously impassable.  \nStreet attested that almost every transition from ramp to street or sidewalk along M-52 has\nlarge lips that cause her scooter almost to tip over, and she often is forced to go outside the painted\ncrosswalks to find a place to safely enter or exit the ramp.  Even when walking short distances,\nStreet stated that she often has to turn sideways in order to safely traverse the ramps, due to the steep\nslopes and poor transitions, which increases her risk of falling.  \nPlaintiff Merlyn Street submitted a declaration generally corroborating his wife’s account\nof her difficulties traversing the US-12 and M-52 curb ramps and sidewalks, which he also has had\nthe same problems with as an elderly survivor of polio.  Neither identified specific problematic\nintersections along US-12 or M-52 \n5.  Lee Benton\nPlaintiff Lee Benton attested that he moved to Ann Arbor in 2014, and in 2015 and 2016 he\nrode the WAVE bus from Ann Arbor to Chelsea, where his parents live.  He has cerebral palsy,\ncannot use his legs, has limited use of his arms, and uses a powered wheelchair.  He described\nproblems similar to those encountered by Mote, Clark, Baraniak, and the Streets while traveling\nfrom his bus stop to the Chelsea summer fair and parade, and while attempting to access the\n-7-\n\nThursday night summer music festivals; but he did not point out the specific intersections where the\nramps were problematic.\n6.  Joanne Ladio\nJoanne Ladio attested that she is the full-time caregiver for plaintiff Carlos Gray-Lion, and\nthat the two have lived together in Chelsea since 1999.  She attested to difficulties pushing Carlos’s\nwheelchair on the pedestrian routes along US-12 and M-52, stating that she had similar difficulties\nas other plaintiffs with the US-12 crossing to the Lake Pierce Boardwalk.  She also attested that in\n2014, 2015, and 2016 she and Carlos only have been able to attend the one stage nearest to their\nhome during the summer music festivals, due to the many (unspecified) impassable curb ramps\nalong M-52.   \n7.  Other Individual Plaintiffs\nPlaintiffs Jennifer Kundak, who has difficulty walking, and J.N. (by his next friend), a minor\nwho has spina bifida and uses a wheelchair and forearm crutches to ambulate, submitted similar\ndeclarations describing their difficulties traversing the same curb ramps discussed by the plaintiffs\nmentioned above. \n8.  Plaintiff Ann Arbor Center for Independent Living (AACIL)\nCarolyn Grawi, director and CEO of plaintiff AACIL, submitted a declaration in which she\nattested that she is blind, cannot drive, and walks using a cane.  AACIL provides services to disabled\nindividuals that include information, peer mentoring, training in individual living skills, advocacy,\nand assistance with community transitions.  Grawi was contacted in late 2015 or early 2016 by\nplaintiffs Mote, Clark, and Baraniak.  She drove to Chelsea to meet with the plaintiffs, where she\nobserved for the first time that many of the businesses along main street had inaccessible entrances,\n-8-\n\nand that much of the street parking in the City was inaccessible.  Grawi referred the plaintiffs to their\ncounsel of record for advice about their legal rights, and she “spent hours inspecting sidewalk, curb\nramp and crosswalk barriers to access throughout Chelsea, which is in AACIL’s service area.”  \nSeveral weeks later, Grawi was driven to Chelsea to meet with City officials about the\naccessibility barriers she had encountered; evidently unsatisfied with the City’s response, the\nAACIL board of directors later voted to file suit against the City under the ADA.  While this lawsuit\nhas been pending, Grawi has had to spend time answering discovery inquiries and attending a\ndeposition, and her involvement in the case has diverted her from work that had to be covered by\nother employees.  Grawi attested that “[d]ue to funding cuts, and layoffs, AACIL is stretched very\nthin,” and “[a]ny time spent on the Chelsea matters is a drain, in people, resources and time that I\nand other employees would otherwise spend on other AACIL work.”  Grawi also attested that her\norganization’s ability to negotiate with commercial businesses in Chelsea to persuade them to make\ntheir premises accessible is hampered because of the time and resources diverted to dealing with\naccessibility defects in the public way, and because Grawi must be “accompanied and assisted by\na non-disabled person even to reach the establishments.” \nB.  The Chelsea Thoroughfares\n1.  State Road 52 (M-52)\nIn 2003 defendant MDOT resurfaced the part of State Road 52 (M-52, a.k.a. “Main Street”)\nthat runs through the City of Chelsea.  MDOT’s representative also testified that the agency\nperiodically “refreshes” painted pavement markings along the M-52 corridor, on an approximately\nfive-year cycle, and that the agency also periodically “salvages” or “replaces” street signs along the\nroad. \n-9-\n\nBeyond those preliminary and apparently undisputed facts, it was difficult to discern any\ncoherent information that could be pertinent to the applicable construction standards from the record\nsubmitted by the plaintiffs relating to M-52.  The plaintiffs attached to their response to MDOT’s\nmotion a vast catalog of inscrutable diagrams and photographs, which perhaps are meant to depict\nthe dimensions and condition of numerous curb ramps at locations along M-52.  However, unlike\nthe description of conditions along US-12, the defects purportedly identified at those locations were\nnot summarized in any affidavit by the plaintiffs’ inspectors, and no deposition or other affidavit\ntestimony was included to explain them.  The plaintiffs also do not cogently summarize or identify\nthe specific defects of those M-52 curb ramps with respect to particular regulations anywhere in\ntheir briefing.  \nAfter reviewing all of those exhibits, without the benefit of any testimonial guidance from\nthe plaintiffs’ inspectors or any explanatory briefing to illuminate the significance of the depictions,\nthe Court could say that there appear to be some locations depicted in the exhibits that are in some\ndegree of disrepair, but cannot draw any conclusions about what a factfinder could ascertain relating\nto any specific defects at those locations that contravene an applicable regulation.\nThe Court discussed that difficulty with the plaintiff’s attorney at oral argument, and invited\nsupplemental briefs that might cure the problem.  However, the plaintiffs’ brief fails to address the\nlack of information required by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(c), regarding the supposed\ndefects along the M-52 (Main Street) corridor.  Contrary to the Court’s direction, the plaintiffs\nrefused to actually enumerate the defects at each of the sidewalk ramps, and instead cited only “one\nexample” of purported defects, referencing the same inscrutable engineering sketches previously\n-10-\n\nsubmitted.  The plaintiffs’ only explanation for their failure to produce an inventory of defects is that\nit would take a lot of pages to make such a list, so they apparently believed they should not try. \n2. Old U.S. 12 (US-12)\nIn 2007, WCRC carried out the “Old U.S. 12 Resurfacing Project,” which was referred to\nin project documents as being undertaken “in cooperation with the Michigan Department of\nTransportation.”  The log stated that the “improvements covered by [it would be] constructed in\naccordance with the Michigan Department of Transportation 2003 standard specifications for\nconstruction,” and it included drawings and specifications for, among other things, “sidewalk ramp\ndetails,” “concrete sidewalks,” and “concrete curb[s].”  The project log stated that “all sidewalk\nramps” within the work zone would be “replaced and/or relocated with ADA compliant ramps.”  An\naccompanying letter from WCRC officials stated that the County required a permit to be issued by\nthe City for work to be performed within the City limits, before it could “submit a final engineering\npackage to the Michigan Department of Transportation Local Agency Section.”  That letter noted\nthat the work would include “reconstruction of the sidewalk drops to become compliant with ADA\nrequirements” at the intersections with Lane Street, Arthur Street, and Old Manchester Road. \nSubsequently, the WCRC entered into a contract with MDOT to procure financing for the project\nfrom MDOT. \nOn October 19, 2016, Derik Bollinger and Ray Schmidt, two superintendents of the City of\nChelsea Public Works Department, inspected several of the intersections along US-12 that were\nincluded within the 2007 resurfacing project.  Bollinger and Schmidt stated in their affidavits that\nthey observed that at the Wilkinson, Arthur, and Lane street “T” intersections, there were only two\ncurb ramps placed at crossings of US-12, meaning that the ramps designated as “1” and “8”\n-11-\n\naccording to the plaintiff’s diagram were omitted (i.e., one ramp at the northwest corner of each\nintersection and one corresponding ramp at the southwest corner).  They also observed that at the\n“+” or “plus” intersection with Taylor street, there also were only two ramps crossing Taylor, with\nramps “4” and “5” omitted from that intersection.  At Wilkinson Street, at ramps “4” and “5”\ncrossing US-12, the superintendents observed “evidence of ponding water, such as staining and\ndebris covering part of the detectable warnings and collected at the transition of each curb ramp to\nOld U.S. 12.”  At that location ramp “4” also “had a running slope of 10%.”  Similarly, at Lane\nStreet they also observed evidence of ponding water, at ramps “2,” “3,” “4,” and “5,” and they noted\nthat ramp “4” had a running slope of 9%.  At Arthur Street, they noted evidence of ponding water\nat ramps “2,” “3,” and “4,” and ramp “2” had a running slope of 10.4%.  At ramps “4” and “5” they\nalso observed a “3/4 to 1 inch abrupt change in level at the transition from the curb ramp to the street\n— an ‘asphalt reverse lip.’”  \nAt Taylor Street, they observed that curb ramps “1,” “2,” and “8” had evidence of ponding\nwater, and ramps “6” and “7” (across Taylor Street) had “missing expansion joints leaving a gap in\nthe surfaces approximately 1.5 inches wide and more than 1 inch deep for the entire widths of the\nramps.”  They also noted a “hole in the asphalt approximately 1.5 inches deep and 7 inches wide”\nin the road surface crosswalk between ramps 6 and 7, and they recorded that ramps 2 and 7 had 1/2\ninch “asphalt reverse lips.” \nMark McCulloch of the WCRC confirmed at his deposition that the work during the 2007\nproject included removing two of the four curb ramps that previously had existed at Arthur and Lane\nStreets.  McCulloch testified that the ramp locations were removed because there were some ramps\nin place on one side of the street with no “receiving” ramp on the other side, and because it was\n-12-\n\ndetermined that reducing the number of “conflict points” between cars and pedestrians along US-12\nwould improve safety.  \nC.  Procedural History\nThe plaintiffs filed their putative class-action complaint seeking declaratory and injunctive\nrelief against the local and state government defendants on April 28, 2016, followed by an amended\ncomplaint to correct procedural defects on August 4, 2016, and a second amended complaint on May\n22,  2017.    The  amended  complaint  alleges  violations  of  ADA  Title  II  (Count  I)  and  the\nRehabilitation  Act  of  1973  (Count  II)  against  the  City  of  Chelsea,  the  City’s  Downtown\nDevelopment Authority, and MDOT.  The complaint also raises a congruent claim against the City\nof Chelsea only under Michigan’s Persons With Disabilities Civil Rights Act (PWDCRA).  With\nleave granted, the City of Chelsea filed a third-party complaint against the WCRC, which the City\ncontends has exclusive control over and responsibility for certain roadways within its city limits.  \nDefendant MDOT filed an answer to the original complaint and a motion for judgment on\nthe pleadings; WCRC responded in similar fashion to the third-party complaint.  The plaintiffs later\nentered into a consent decree with the City of Chelsea, and they filed their second amended\ncomplaint naming WCRC as a principal defendant.\nAfter discovery closed, defendants WCRC and MDOT filed their summary judgment\nmotions. \nII.\nSummary judgment is appropriate “if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as\nto any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). \nUnder Rule 56, the party bringing the summary judgment motion has the initial burden of informing\n-13-\n\nthe court of the basis for its motion and identifying portions of the record that demonstrate the\nabsence of a genuine dispute over material facts.  Mt. Lebanon Pers. Care Home, Inc. v. Hoover\nUniversal, Inc., 276 F.3d 845, 848 (6th Cir. 2002).  If the party opposing the motion contends facts\nare in dispute, she may not “rely on the hope that the trier of fact will disbelieve the movant’s denial\nof a disputed fact” but must make an affirmative showing with proper evidence to defeat the motion. \nStreet v. J.C. Bradford & Co., 886 F.2d 1472, 1479 (6th Cir. 1989).  Nor may she “simply show that\nthere is some ‘metaphysical doubt as to the material facts.’”  Highland Capital, Inc. v. Franklin\nNat’l Bank, 350 F.3d 558, 564 (6th Cir. 2003) (quoting Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio\nCorp., 475 U.S. 574, 586 (1986)) (internal quotation marks omitted).  \nInstead, the opposing party must designate specific facts in affidavits, depositions, or other\nfactual material showing “evidence on which the jury could reasonably find for the plaintiff.” \nAnderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 252 (1986).  Those facts must be “established by\nevidence that will be admissible at trial.”  Alexander v. CareSource, 576 F.3d 551, 558 (6th Cir.\n2009) (citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e)(2))  If the non-moving party, after sufficient opportunity for\ndiscovery, is unable to meet his or her burden of proof, summary judgment is clearly proper. \nCelotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322-23 (1986).  “Thus, the mere existence of a scintilla of\nevidence in support of the [opposing party]’s position will be insufficient; there must be evidence\non which the jury could reasonably find for the [opposing party].”  350 F.3d at 546 (quoting 477\nU.S. at 252) (quotations omitted).\n-14-\n\nA.  ADA, Rehabilitation Act, and State Law\n1.  The ADA and its Regulations\nTitle II of the ADA prohibits the exclusion of a “qualified individual with a disability” from\n“participation in” or enjoying the “benefits of the services, programs, or activities of a public entity.” \n42 U.S.C. § 12132.  It also prohibits “discrimination by any such entity.”  Ibid.  “‘Public entity’\nincludes ‘any state or local government’ and ‘any department, agency, special purpose district, or\nother instrumentality of a State or States or local government.’”  Ability Center of Greater Toledo\nv. City of Sandusky, 385 F.3d 901, 904 (6th Cir. 2004) (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 12131(1)(A) & (B)). \nThrough section 204 of the ADA, Congress granted to the Attorney General the “authority\nto promulgate regulations to implement its provisions.”  Ibid. (citing 42 U.S.C. § 12134).  One of\nthose regulations, 28 C.F.R. § 35.151, governs construction and alteration of public facilities\ncommenced after January 26, 1992.  When the alteration “could affect the usability of the facility,”\nthe alterations must be designed and constructed “in such manner that the altered portion of the\nfacility is readily accessible and usable by individuals with disabilities.’”  Ibid. (quoting 28 C.F.R.\n§ 35.151(b)).  The regulations define the term “facility” to include “all or any portion of buildings,\nstructures,  sites,  complexes,  equipment,  rolling  stock  or  other  conveyances,  roads,  walks,\npassageways, parking lots, or other real or personal property, including the site where the building,\nproperty, structure, or equipment is located.”  28 C.F.R. § 35.104.  \nAs the Court explained in its previous opinion in this case, “‘To be “readily accessible,” any\npart of a newly constructed or altered facility must be constructed in conformance with the\nAmericans with Disabilities Act Accessibility Guidelines for Buildings and Facilities (ADAAG),\n28 C.F.R. Pt. 36, App. A, or with the Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards (UFAS), 41 C.F.R.\nPt. 101-19.6, App. A.’”  Mote, 252 F. Supp. 3d at 649 (citing Daubert v. Lindsay Unified Sch. Dist.,\n-15-\n\n760 F.3d 982, 986 (9th Cir. 2014); 28 C.F.R. § 35.151(c)(1)-(3)).  The ADAAG is a set of\nregulations that set out, in comprehensive detail, the design specifics for structures and facilities to\nmake them “readily accessible” to disabled persons.  The regulations also require a public entity to\n“maintain in operable working condition those features of facilities and equipment that are required\nto be readily accessible to and usable by persons with disabilities by the Act or this part.”  28 C.F.R.\n§ 35.133.\nWith respect to curb ramps, section 35.151(i) expressly requires that “(1) Newly constructed\nor altered streets, roads, and highways must contain curb ramps or other sloped areas at any\nintersection having curbs or other barriers to entry from a street level pedestrian walkway,” and “(2)\nNewly constructed or altered street level pedestrian walkways must contain curb ramps or other\nsloped areas at intersections to streets, roads, or highways.”  28 C.F.R. § 35.151(i).  The DOJ has\ninterpreted this regulation to require that “[w]hen streets, roads, or highways are newly built or\naltered, they must have ramps or sloped areas wherever there are curbs or other barriers to entry\nfrom a sidewalk or path.  Likewise, when new sidewalks or paths are built or are altered, they must\ncontain curb ramps or sloped areas wherever they intersect with streets, roads, or highways.”  U.S.\nDOJ, ADA Title II Technical Assistance Manual II-6.6000 (https://www.ada.gov/taman2.html).\nThe ADAAG sets forth detailed specifications for the location and construction of curb\nramps in Section 4.7 of the Guidelines (1991 version).  As an initial matter, the Guidelines define\nthe term “accessible route” as “[a] continuous unobstructed path connecting all accessible elements\nand spaces of a building or facility.”  ADAAG 3.4.  “Exterior accessible routes may include parking\naccess aisles, curb ramps, crosswalks at vehicular ways, walks, ramps, and lifts.”  Ibid.  The phrase\n“curb ramp” refers to “[a] short ramp cutting through a curb or built up to it.”  Ibid.  “If an accessible\n-16-\n\nroute has changes in level greater than 1/2 in (13 mm), then a curb ramp . . . shall be provided that\ncomplies with [ADAAG 4.7].”  ADAAG 4.3.8.  “Curb ramps complying with [ADAAG 4.7] shall\nbe provided wherever an accessible route crosses a curb.”  ADAAG 4.7.1.\n“Slopes of curb ramps shall comply with [ADAAG 4.8.2].”  ADAAG 4.7.2.  Section 4.8.2\nspecifies that “[t]he least possible slope shall be used for any ramp,” “[t]he maximum slope of a\nramp in new construction shall be 1:12,” and “[t]he maximum rise for any run shall be 30 [inches].” \nADAAG 4.8.2.  “Transitions from ramps to walks, gutters, or streets shall be flush and free of abrupt\nchanges,” and “[m]aximum slopes of adjoining gutters, road surface immediately adjacent to the\ncurb ramp, or accessible route shall not exceed 1:20.”  Ibid.  “The minimum width of a curb ramp\nshall be 36 [inches], exclusive of flared sides.”  ADAAG 4.7.3.  “Surfaces of curb ramps shall\ncomply with [section] 4.5.”  ADAAG 4.7.4.  Section 4.5 covers “ground and floor surfaces”\ngenerally and states, among other things, that (1) “[g]round and floor surfaces along accessible\nroutes and in accessible rooms and spaces including floors, walks, ramps, stairs, and curb ramps,\nshall be stable, firm, [and] slip-resistant”; (2) changes in level less than 1/4” may be “vertical and\nwithout treatment”; and (3) changes between 1/4 and 1/2” must be beveled and with a slope no\ngreater than 1:2.  ADAAG 4.5.1-4.5.2.\nCurb ramps must “be located or protected to prevent their obstruction by parked vehicles,”\nand ramps “at marked crossings shall be wholly contained within the markings, excluding any flared\nsides.”  ADAAG 4.7.8-4.7.9.  “Outdoor ramps and their approaches shall be designed so that water\nwill not accumulate on walking surfaces.”  ADAAG 4.8.8.\n-17-\n\n2.  The Rehabilitation Act \nSection 504 of the Rehabilitation Act parallels the command of the ADA concerning\naccessibility to public facilities for persons with disabilities, but it applies only to “any program or\nactivity receiving Federal financial assistance.’”  Babcock v. Michigan, 812 F.3d 531, 540 (6th Cir.\n2016) (quoting 29 U.S.C. § 794(a)).  “[T]he remedies, procedures, and rights available under Title\nII of the ADA parallel those available under [The Rehabilitation Act].”  Ability Center, 385 F.3d at\n905 & n.7 (citing 29 U.S.C. 794a(a)(2); Barnes v. Gorman, 536 U.S. 181, 189 n.3 (2002); Johnson\nv. City of Saline, 151 F.3d 564, 573 (6th Cir. 1998)).  Thus, the Sixth Circuit has explained that its\n“analysis of Rehabilitation Act claims ‘roughly parallels’ ADA claims because the statutes contain\nsimilar language and are ‘quite similar in purpose and scope.’”  Babcock, 812 F.3d at 540 (quoting\nMcPherson v. Michigan High School Athletic Association, Inc., 119 F.3d 453, 459-60 (6th Cir.\n1997)).\n  The regulations enacted under the Rehabilitation Act apply “to each recipient of Federal\nfinancial assistance from the Department of Transportation and to each program or activity that\nreceives such assistance,” and require that “all [] entities subject to section 504 shall design,\nconstruct, or alter buildings, or other fixed facilities, in conformance with appendices B and D of\n36 C.F.R. part 1191, as modified by appendix A to part 37 of this title.”  49 C.F.R. § 27.3.  “The\nRehabilitation Act has a set of standards nearly identical to the ADAAG called the Uniform Federal\nAccessibility Standards (‘UFAS’).  41 C.F.R. pt. 101-19.6, app. A.”  Greer v. Richardson Indep.\nSch. Dist., 472 F. App’x 287, 291 n.2 (5th Cir. 2012). \n-18-\n\n3.  State Law\nThe state law counterpart to these two federal statutory mandates is the Michigan Persons\nWith Disabilities Civil Rights Act (PWDCRA), Mich. Comp. Laws § 37.1101, et seq.  That\nenactment “‘substantially mirrors the ADA, and resolution of a plaintiff’s ADA claim will generally,\nthough not always, resolve the plaintiff’s PWDCRA claim.’”  Donald v. Sybra, Inc., 667 F.3d 757,\n764 (6th Cir. 2012) (quoting Cotter v. Ajilon Servs., Inc., 287 F.3d 593, 597 (6th Cir. 2002)).\nB.  MDOT’s Summary Judgment Motion\nMDOT’s legal position has evolved with each of the briefs it filed on its motion for summary\njudgment.  In its final reply brief, filed after the Court issued its opinion on MDOT’s and WCRC’s\nRule 12 motions, the MDOT argued that: (1) it is responsible for building and maintaining state\nroads such as M-52, but it is not responsible for any work done on Old U.S. 12, a county road, even\nif it served as a “funding conduit” for work done under the County’s authority; (2) MDOT is not\nresponsible for constructing or maintaining sidewalks, even if they run along a state road, because\nmunicipalities are responsible for building and maintaining sidewalks within their borders, (citing\nMich. Comp. Laws § 103.1; 1963 Mich. Const. art. VII, § 29); (3) in any event, the plaintiffs have\nnot identified any “sidewalk” that is defective that MDOT took upon itself to repair, and their\nevidence relates only to “curb ramps”; (4) the plaintiffs have not identified any intersection along\nM-52 that does not feature fully ADAAG-compliant curb ramps; and (5) the ADA does not require\naccessible on street parking to be located in any particular place, and under state law motorists are\nallowed to park along any public street where not otherwise prohibited, so the failure to construct\naccessible on-street parking in any particular spot does not violate any cognizable provision of the\nADAAG.  \n-19-\n\nIn a supplemental brief, filed with the Court’s permission, MDOT also raised a new\nargument that the State of Michigan’s Eleventh Amendment sovereign immunity bars all of the\nplaintiffs’ claims under ADA Title II, because (1) the failure to build curb ramps in full conformance\nwith the ADAAG guidelines does not violate any fundamental constitutional guarantee secured by\nthe Fourteenth Amendment, and (2) the Title II mandate for strict ADAAG compliance in all new\nconstruction is not otherwise valid because it was not a “congruent” and “proportional” response\nto any Congressional findings of widespread discrimination against the disabled by the states that\ninformed Congress’s passage of the ADA.\nMDOT’s sovereign immunity arguments have little impact on the ultimate disposition of this\ncase, for a couple of reasons.  First, although (subject to three exceptions, noted below) the Eleventh\nAmendment bars suits in federal court “in which [a] State or one of its agencies or departments is\nnamed as the defendant,” Pennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. v. Halderman, 465 U.S. 89, 100 (1984),\neven if the defendant prevails on its position that the Eleventh Amendment bars the ADA claims\nlodged against MDOT itself, the plaintiffs would be able to salvage their claims by the simple\nexpedient of amending the complaint to drop the state agency and name its present highest official\nas a defendant instead.  “[T]he Eleventh Amendment does not preclude a suit against [state official\ndefendants named in their official capacities] for prospective injunctive relief.”  McCormick v.\nMiami University, 693 F.3d 654, 662 (6th Cir. 2012) (citing McKay v. Thompson, 226 F.3d 752, 757\n(6th Cir. 2000) (“The district court correctly determined that the Eleventh Amendment permits\nprospective injunctive relief, but not damage awards, for suits against individuals in their official\ncapacities under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.”)); see also Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. 123, 159 (1908).  \n-20-\n\nSecond, it is undisputed that the defendants received and used federal funds to construct all\nof the sidewalks and curb ramps in question, and, as a result, they were subjected to materially\nidentical accessibility mandates under the Rehabilitation Act, which are coextensive with those\nimposed by the ADA.  Neither defendant has raised any coherent argument to explain how it is not\nbound to abide by the Rehabilitation Act mandates, and MDOT concedes in a footnote that its entire\nelaborately briefed Eleventh Amendment argument is inapplicable to the Rehabilitation Act, and that\nit is not immune to claims brought under that authority.  Def.\n MDOT’s Supp. Brief [dkt. #75] at 10 n.1 (“MDOT recognizes that it is not immune to Plaintiffs’\nRehabilitation Act claims.”).  \nAs the federal courts have long recognized, “Title II of the ADA was expressly modeled after\n§ 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 [and] essentially extends coverage to state and local\ngovernment entities that do not receive federal funds.”  Pierce v. County of Orange, 526 F.3d 1190,\n1217 (9th Cir. 2008).  The courts “have therefore observed that ‘[t]here is no significant difference\nin analysis of the rights and obligations created by the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act.’”  Ibid.\n(quoting Zukle v. Regents of Univ. of California, 166 F.3d 1041, 1045 n. 11 (9th Cir. 1999)).  The\nregulations enacted under the authority of the Rehabilitation Act apply “to each recipient of Federal\nfinancial assistance from the Department of Transportation and to each program or activity that\nreceives such assistance,” and require that “all . . . entities subject to section 504 shall design,\nconstruct, or alter buildings, or other fixed facilities, in conformance with appendices B and D of\n36 C.F.R. part 1191, as modified by appendix A to part 37 of this title.”  49 C.F.R. § 27.3.  “The\nRehabilitation Act has a set of standards nearly identical to the ADAAG called the Uniform Federal\nAccessibility Standards (‘UFAS’).  41 C.F.R. pt. 101-19.6, app. A.”  Greer, 472 F. App’x at 291. \n-21-\n\nIn yet another supplemental brief, MDOT attempts to advance the argument that the\nRehabilitation Act’s regulations are invalid ab initio because they never were submitted to the\nproper congressional authority for approval.  That argument was not raised in any previous briefs\nthat MDOT filed, and was mentioned in passing for the first time at oral argument.  After that\nhearing, the Court allowed the parties to submit supplemental briefs, primarily to permit the\nplaintiffs to address their failure to support their arguments with specific references to the record. \nAlthough the Court allowed additional briefing to address items discussed at oral argument that were\nnot addressed in earlier briefs, MDOT mistook that allowance as an invitation to submit what\namounted to another summary judgment motion based on a new theory that contradicted a position\nit took in an earlier brief.  The Court struck its latest brief for that reason; because the latest\nargument was not raised on a timely basis, it is deemed waived.  See, e.g., Piazza v. Aponte Roque,\n909 F.2d 35, 37 (1st Cir. 1990) (noting arguments raised for the first time at oral argument are\ndeemed waived); Sodexo Mgmt., Inc. v. Detroit Pub. Sch., 200 F. Supp. 3d 679, 694 (E.D. Mich.\n2016) (holding that arguments “raised for the first time in a reply brief renders this argument\nwaived”) (citing McPherson v. Kelsey, 125 F.3d 989, 995-96 (6th Cir. 1997)).  MDOT has filed a\nmotion to reconsider the order striking its last brief, but it has not identified a basis to overturn the\nCourt’s ruling.  See E.D. Mich. LR 7.1(b)(2) (“A party must obtain leave of court to file more than\none motion for summary judgment.”).  \nThird, MDOT’s sovereign immunity does not excuse it from potential ADA violations. \nThere are three exceptions to Eleventh Amendment immunity: (1) when the state has waived its\nimmunity by consenting to the lawsuit; (2) when Congress has abrogated the state’s sovereign\nimmunity; and (3) when the plaintiff seeks only prospective injunctive relief against a state official\n-22-\n\nfrom violating federal law.  Boler v. Earley, 865 F.3d 391, 410 (6th Cir. 2017) (citing cases).  The\nsecond exception applies to the present alignment of the parties in this case.  \n“Congress may abrogate the states’ Eleventh Amendment sovereign immunity pursuant to\nthe enforcement provisions of § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment when Congress both ‘unequivocally\nintends to do so and acts pursuant to a valid grant of constitutional authority.’”  Babcock, 812 F.3d\nat 534 (6th Cir. 2016) (quoting Board of Trustees of Univ. of Ala. v. Garrett, 531 U.S. 356, 363\n(2001)) (quotation marks and alterations omitted).  “In other words, the ADA only applies to the\nstates to the extent that the statute is enacted pursuant to a valid grant of Congress’s authority.”  Ibid. \nAs to the first element of the Garrett analysis, it is beyond dispute that “Congress has expressed an\nunequivocal desire to abrogate Eleventh Amendment immunity for violations of the ADA.”  Ibid.\n(citing 42 U.S.C. § 12202 (“A State shall not be immune under the eleventh amendment to the\nConstitution of the United States from an action in [a] Federal or State court of competent\njurisdiction for a violation of this chapter.”)).  However, “the Supreme Court has held that\nCongress’s attempted abrogation is only valid in limited circumstances, depending upon the nature\nof the ADA claim.”  Ibid.  To determine if a case fits one of those circumstances of Title II ADA\nclaims, “the Supreme Court has set forth a three-part test:\n[D]etermine . . . on a claim-by-claim basis, (1) which aspects of the State’s alleged\nconduct violated Title II; (2) to what extent such misconduct also violated the\nFourteenth Amendment; and (3) insofar as such misconduct violated Title II but did\nnot violate the Fourteenth Amendment, whether Congress’s purported abrogation of\nsovereign immunity as to that class of conduct is nevertheless valid.”\nIbid. (quoting United States v. Georgia, 546 U.S. 151, 159 (2006)).  \nAs to the first element of the Georgia analysis, the Supreme Court has explained that courts\nmust identify with some particularity the plaintiffs’ rights that allegedly were invaded, which they\n-23-\n\ncontend should be vindicated by enforcement of the ADA.  That is so because, “[w]hile § 5\nauthorizes Congress to enact reasonably prophylactic remedial legislation, the appropriateness of\nthe remedy depends on the gravity of the harm it seeks to prevent.”  Tennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S.\n509, 523-24 (2004).  And as the Court observed, “difficult and intractable problems often require\npowerful remedies,” but “strong measures appropriate to address one harm may be an unwarranted\nresponse to another, lesser one.”  Ibid. (quotations omitted).\nIn this case, the plaintiffs testified that, as a result of the accessibility defects in the\ndefendants’ sidewalks and curb ramps, they have been denied equal access to the City’s pedestrian\nthruways in order to get to public facilities and events, because they are unable to travel along the\nsame paths taken by other pedestrians who are not disabled.  Depriving a disabled individual of the\nability to traverse the public spaces used by his or her fellow citizens certainly amounts to a severe\nburden on his or her participation in public life — perhaps among the most severe impairments that\ncan be imposed.  Title II was intended to “enforce a variety of . . . basic constitutional guarantees,”\nLane, 541 U.S. at 522, but the guarantee of the ability freely to travel in the public way is among the\nmost fundamental of those.  All of the other promises of equal access under the ADA “would be\nmeaningless if people who use wheelchairs were not afforded the opportunity to travel on and\nbetween the streets.’”  Ability Center, 385 F.3d at 911-12 (6th Cir. 2004) (quoting H.R.Rep. No.\n101-485, pt. 2, at 84 (1990), reprinted in 1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. 303, 367 (emphasis added)).\nAs to the second element, the plaintiffs have not submitted sufficient evidence to establish\nthat the alleged accessibility defects resulted in any invasion of their rights under the Fourteenth\nAmendment.  They mount undeveloped arguments that they were deprived of their rights to engage\nin “commerce” and that their inability to travel around the City could impair their First Amendment\n-24-\n\nright of free association.  But their testimony does not suggest plausibly any instances in which those\nfundamental constitutional rights were injured.\nTherefore, the Court must determine whether “Congress’[s] chosen remedy for the pattern\nof exclusion and discrimination” that it observed was met with a legislative mandate that “was\ncongruent and proportional to its object of enforcing the right of access . . . .”  Lane, 541 U.S. at 531. \nThe defendant contends that Congress did not identify any pattern of exclusion from public facilities\nwhen it enacted the ADA, but the Lane Court squarely held otherwise.  “Congress enacted Title II\nagainst a backdrop of pervasive unequal treatment in the administration of state services and\nprograms, including systematic deprivations of fundamental rights.”  Lane, 541 U.S. at 524.  “This\npattern of disability discrimination persisted despite several federal and state legislative efforts to\naddress it.”  Id. at 526.  And “[t]he conclusion that Congress drew from [the] evidence is set forth\nin the text of the ADA itself: ‘[D]iscrimination against individuals with disabilities persists in such\ncritical areas as . . . education, transportation, communication, recreation, institutionalization, health\nservices, voting, and access to public services.’”  Id. at 529 (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 12101(a)(3)). \n“This finding, together with the extensive record of disability discrimination that underlies it, makes\nclear beyond peradventure that inadequate provision of public services and access to public\nfacilities was an appropriate subject for prophylactic legislation.”  Ibid.  Moreover, as the district\ncourt noted in Mason v. City of Huntsville, Ala., No. 10-02794, 2012 WL 4815518 (N.D. Ala. Oct.\n10, 2012), Congress was particularly concerned with the isolation from public life that resulted from\naccessibility barriers in the public way:\nIn the House Report published in conjunction with the 1990 enactment of the ADA,\nCongressional inquiries and testimony showed that, before the ADA, “it [was] clear\nthat an overwhelming majority of individuals with disabilities lead isolated lives.”\nH.R. Rep. 101-485, pt. 2, at 34 (alteration supplied).  The report stated that\n-25-\n\n“[d]iscrimination  also  includes  harms  resulting  from  the  construction  of\ntransportation, architectural, and communication barriers.”  Id. at 33 (emphasis\nsupplied).  The report labeled transportation as “the linchpin which enables people\nwith disabilities to be integrated and mainstreamed into society,” and recognized that\n“accessible transportation . . . promotes the self-reliance and self-sufficiency of\npeople with disabilities.  People who cannot get to work or to the voting place cannot\nexercise their rights and obligations as citizens.”  Id. at 37.\nMason, 2012 WL 4815518, at *10 (emphasis added and in original).\nThe remaining question, therefore, is “whether Title II is an appropriate response to this\nhistory and pattern of unequal treatment,” and in particular whether the mandate of strict compliance\nwith the ADAAG specifications in the case of new constructions or alterations after 1992 was a\ncongruent and proportional response to an identified pattern of denial of equal access by the disabled\nto avenues of travel in the public way.  Here, as the Lane court observed, “[t]he remedy Congress\nchose is [] a limited one,” where it mandated only that “the States [] take reasonable measures to\nremove architectural and other barriers to accessibility.”  42 U.S.C. § 12131(2).  Moreover, the\nstates are allowed the flexibility to work around obstacles “in the case of older facilities, for which\nstructural change is likely to be more difficult,” where “a public entity may comply with Title II by\nadopting a variety of less costly measures, including relocating services to alternative, accessible\nsites and assigning aides to assist persons with disabilities in accessing services.”  Id. at 532 (citing\n28 C.F.R. § 35.150(b)(1)).  But “[i]n the case of facilities built or altered after 1992,” where the cost\nof incorporating new accommodations likely will be nominal, “the regulations require compliance\nwith specific architectural accessibility standards.”  Ibid. (citing 28 C.F.R. § 35.151); Venus v.\nSeville Food, LLC, No. 14-2476, 2017 WL 2364192, at *12 (D.N.J. May 31, 2017) (“‘Because it\ncosts far less to incorporate accessible design into the planning and construction of new buildings\nand of alterations as compared to retrofitting existing structures, a higher standard of “readily\n-26-\n\naccessible to and usable by” persons with disabilities has been adopted in the ADA for new\nconstruction and alterations.’” (quoting H.R.Rep. No. 101–485(III) at 60, reprinted at 1990\nU.S.C.C.A.N. 445, 483)). \nThe ADA’s flexible imperative, requiring the greatest extent of accommodations only in\ncases where the cost of compliance would be the least, was an eminently “congruent” and\n“proportional” response to the historical pattern of isolation of the disabled from public life that\nCongress found had resulted from architectural obstacles that economically can be eliminated with\nproper attention to design details in new construction.  Mason, 2012 WL 4815518, at *11\n(“Considering the clear and persistent history of discrimination against persons with disabilities and\nthe Congressional recognition of the importance of accessible streets, sidewalks, and parking areas,\nthis court finds that Title II is a congruent and proportional and, therefore, constitutional exercise\nof Section 5 enforcement power as applied to equal access to publically-maintained sidewalks, curb\nramps, and parking areas.”).  \nCongress’s abrogation of the states’ sovereign immunity in Title II of the ADA was a valid\nexercise of its remedial power under setcion 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.  MDOT’s Eleventh\nAmendment defense here fails.  \nBut the plaintiffs are not home free with that determination.  Far from it.  Their brief\nresponding to MDOT’s summary judgment motion does not identify issues of fact for trial under the\nprescriptions of Rule 56 on any specific sidewalk or curb ramp feature along M-52.  Their brief\nconsists mostly of large segments of language copied from the Court’s previous opinion in this case,\nwhich were included in the plaintiffs’ papers nearly verbatim, with no attribution.  The plaintiffs also\nincluded exhibits denominated as “fact sets,” which comprise nothing more than argumentative\n-27-\n\nsummaries of certain affidavits and other exhibits depicting the conditions in the defendant’s right\nof way.  However, their briefing did not include anywhere an explanation of how any specific\ndefects identified in the curb ramps constructed by MDOT violated provisions of the ADAAG. \nThey have failed to put forth any coherent evidentiary presentation to identify what specific defects\nthey believe exist, at which specific curb ramps along M-52 that they contend are defective. \nCertainly the testimony of the individual plaintiffs suggests that some of the curb ramps on Main\nStreet have dangerous defects that made them difficult to navigate and obstructed the plaintiffs’\nability fully to access and enjoy public events (such as the Thursday evening music festivals). \nHowever, none of that testimony identifies with any specificity what ADAAG-violating aspects of\nthe design or construction of any particular curb ramps led to those difficulties that the plaintiffs\nencountered.  Moreover, there is no evidence in the record tending to suggest that MDOT\nconstructed or altered any of those ramps after 1992, or identifying which ramps the agency\nconstructed or altered that now have cognizable defects.\nIn their briefing the plaintiffs rely solely on general citations to a prolix, undifferentiated\nmass of inscrutable technical diagrams and scrawlings, which they contend illustrate numerous\ninstances of ADAAG violations.  That is insufficient.  The mere reference to those technical\ndrawings, inviting the court to cull through them in search of a fact question, “falls well short of\n‘direct[ing] the court’s attention to those specific portions of the record upon which [the plaintiff\nsought] to rely to create a genuine issue of material fact.”  Bormuth v. Cty. of Jackson, 870 F.3d 494,\n500 (6th Cir. 2017) (citing Chicago Title Ins. Corp. v. Magnuson, 487 F.3d 985, 995 (6th Cir.\n2007)).  This Court is not charged with the responsibility of constructing the plaintiffs’ arguments\nfor them, from unannotated documents presented to the Court en masse.  The court of appeals “never\n-28-\n\nrequired such advocacy by a district court . . . .”  Ibid. (citing Guarino v. Brookfield Twp. Trustees,\n980 F.2d 399, 410 (6th Cir. 1992) (holding that a district court is not obligated to “comb the record\nfrom the partisan perspective of an advocate for the non-moving party”)).  \nThe plaintiffs have utterly failed to point out for the Court which portions of those exhibits\ncorrelate to what specific ADAAG violations that they allege.   They have not met their burden\nunder Rule 56.  Fed. R. Civ. P 56(c)(1) (“A party asserting that a fact cannot be or is genuinely\ndisputed must support the assertion by: (A) citing . . . particular parts of materials in the record,\nincluding depositions, documents, electronically stored information, affidavits or declarations,\nstipulations (including those made for purposes of the motion only), admissions, interrogatory\nanswers, or other materials; or (B) showing that the materials cited do not establish the absence or\npresence of a genuine dispute, or that an adverse party cannot produce admissible evidence to\nsupport the fact.”) (emphasis added).\nCalling that defect to the plaintiffs’ attention at oral argument, the Court invited plaintiffs’\ncounsel to address the problem in a supplemental brief.  To tame the impenetrable record they\nsubmitted, the Court suggested that the plaintiffs identify those specific curb ramps along M-52 that\nthey contend are defective, stating (1) the exact location of each allegedly defective ramp; (2) the\ndefects identified in each ramp, with pinpoint citations of exhibits in the record evidencing those\ndefects, and citations of the specific ADAAG provision that the plaintiffs contend was violated by\neach defect; and (3) any evidence in the record tending to show that each of the ramps complained\nof was built or modified by defendant MDOT, and when the construction or alteration of the ramp\noccurred.  \n-29-\n\nThe plaintiffs have not capitalized on that opportunity.  Contrary to the Court’s direction, the\nplaintiffs refused actually to enumerate the defects at each of the sidewalk ramps, and instead cited\nonly “one example” of purported defects, referencing the same inscrutable engineering sketches\npreviously submitted.  The plaintiffs’ only explanation for their failure to produce an inventory of\ndefects is that it would take a lot of pages to make such a list, so they did not do it.  \nThere also are two other major problems with the mass of materials submitted in support of\nthe plaintiffs’ response, which were not addressed at all in the plaintiffs’ supplement.  One is that\nthe documents they submitted are unauthenticated by any accompanying affidavit testimony by\nanyone who was involved in producing them, at least with respect to M-52.  Nor were they\naccompanied by any comprehensible summary of defects correlating the discrete measurements with\nidentifiable ADA Guideline transgressions.  Such affidavits or declarations are necessary to show\nthat the documents would be admissible at trial.  See Alexander, 576 F.3d at 558 (noting that “the\nparty opposing summary judgment must show that she can make good on the promise of the\npleadings by laying out enough evidence that will be admissible at trial to demonstrate that a\ngenuine issue on a material fact exists, and that a trial is necessary”) (emphasis added). \nA second problem is that the plaintiffs’ documents probably would not be admissible even\nif they were authenticated and properly summarized so that the Court could understand them.  They\nobviously represent information collected by parties to this litigation, for the purpose of supporting\ntheir positions, which are materially adverse to defendant MDOT.  Those documents likely amount\nto inadmissible hearsay statements, not subject to any apparent exception. See Fed. R. Evid. 801(c). \nAlthough they might be fodder for properly documented and disclosed expert opinion testimony\nabout the sidewalk conditions via Rule 702, no such testimony has been submitted in opposition to\n-30-\n\nthe summary judgment motion, and the documents themselves likely would not be admissible. \nTherefore, they do not suffice to oppose MDOT’s summary judgment motion.  See Alpert v. United\nStates, 481 F.3d 404, 409 (6th Cir.2007) (noting that “‘evidence submitted in opposition to a motion\nfor summary judgment must be admissible’”) (quoting United States Structures, Inc. v. J.P.\nStructures, Inc., 130 F.3d 1185, 1189 (6th Cir. 1997)). \nThe plaintiffs’ claims against MDOT concerning the M-52 corridor must be dismissed\nbecause the plaintiffs have failed to submit adequate, prospectively admissible information to\nestablish the existence of any defects in the sidewalks along that route, which violate any of the\nregulations enacted under the ADA or the Rehabilitation Act.  The record does not establish a\nmaterial fact question for trial.  Therefore, MDOT’s motion for summary judgment will be granted. \nC.  WCRC’s Motion for Summary Judgment\nIn its motion for summary judgment, including an amended reply brief filed after the\nplaintiffs filed their response, defendant WCRC argues that: (1) the Sixth Circuit’s decision in\nBabcock v. Michigan inevitably points to the conclusion that sidewalks are not “services” within the\nmeaning of the ADA and therefore not subject to its regulations; (2) even if the Court finds that\nsidewalks are a “service,” any such “service” must be viewed in its entirety, “the entire system of\nsidewalks would be the service, and the plaintiffs would have to show that they were denied\nmeaningful access to that system; (3) none of the plaintiffs testified at their depositions about any\nplace they were unable to get to via the pedestrian routes along Old US-12; (4) the DOJ regulations\nunlawfully “impose obligations on public entities that are not imposed by Title II,” where they\nrequire “that facilities be ‘to the maximum extent feasible . . . constructed [or altered] in such\nmanner that the facility is readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities,’” (quoting\n-31-\n\n28 C.F.R. 35.150(a)); (5) as to the placement of new curb ramps that do not already exist, the road\ncommission must be allowed discretion to decide what locations are safe for pedestrians to cross,\nand the agency should not be required to place crosswalks (and therefore curb ramps) at unsafe or\nimpractical locations; and (6) all of the alleged deficits in the existing ramps based on their present\ncondition are issues of “maintenance,” not “construction”; maintenance is the obligation of the local\nmunicipality under state law. \nWCRC also asserts that the plaintiffs’ accessibility claims are untimely under the applicable\nthree-year statute of limitations.  Finally, WCRC argues that plaintiff AACIL lacks organizational\nstanding to participate in this lawsuit because its executive director could not identify at her\ndeposition any financial harm suffered by the organization as a result of the alleged discrimination,\nand she admitted that the organization does not have “members” as such on whose behalf the\nAACIL could pursue the claims raised in this case.\n1.  Sidewalks are “Facilities” Under the ADA\nDefendant  WCRC  argues  with  great  vigor  about  the  purported  distinction  between\n“services”and “facilities,” contending that sidewalks are not “services,” and therefore are beyond\nthe reach of Title II of the ADA.  However, the distinction is of little consequence, since sidewalks\ncertainly are “facilities” under the plain language of the ADA, and it is beyond dispute that the\nADAAG guidelines promulgated under the ADA that govern the construction of public facilities\nbuilt or altered after 1992 therefore apply to them.  \nThe term “facility” is defined under the applicable ADA regulations to include “all or any\nportion of buildings, structures, sites, complexes, equipment, rolling stock or other conveyances,\nroads, walks, passageways, parking lots, or other real or personal property, including the site where\n-32-\n\nthe building, property, structure, or equipment is located.”  28 C.F.R. § 35.104.  The defendant’s\nroadway, the sidewalks adjoining it which the defendant built or altered, and the curb ramps\nconnecting them all plainly qualify as “facilities” under that definition.  And the ADA regulations\nalso plainly require that any “alterations of facilities commenced after January 26, 1992, ‘by, on\nbehalf of, or for the use of a public entity in a manner that affects or could affect the usability of the\nfacility or part of the facility shall, to the maximum extent feasible, be altered in such manner that\nthe altered portion of the facility is readily accessible and usable by individuals with disabilities.’” \nAbility Center, 385 F.3d at 904 (quoting 28 C.F.R. § 35.151(b)).  As noted above, ready accessibility\nrequires new construction or alterations to be ADAAG-compliant.  Mote, 252 F. Supp. 3d at 649\n(citing Daubert, 760 F.3d at 986; 28 C.F.R. § 35.151(c)(1)-(3)).  \nMoreover, it has been accepted by federal courts for more than two decades that ADA Title\nII imposes an affirmative mandate on public entities to ensure that facilities newly constructed or\naltered after 1992 comply with the ADAAG specifications.  Lane, 541 U.S. at 532 (“In the case of\nfacilities built or altered after 1992, the regulations require compliance with specific architectural\naccessibility standards”) (citing 28 C.F.R. § 35.151 (2003); Ability Center, 385 F.3d at 913 (“In\nconclusion, § 202 of Title II does not merely prohibit intentional discrimination. It also imposes on\npublic entities the requirement that they provide qualified disabled individuals with meaningful\naccess to public services, which in certain instances necessitates that public entities take affirmative\nsteps to remove architectural barriers to such access in the process of altering existing facilities. 28\nC.F.R. § 35.151 is a regulation adopted by the Attorney General at Title II’s express direction that\neffectuates this aim.”); Barden v. City of Sacramento, 292 F.3d 1073, 1076 (9th Cir. 2002) (“In\nkeeping with our precedent, maintaining public sidewalks is a normal function of a city and without\n-33-\n\na doubt something that the [City] ‘does.’  Maintaining their accessibility for individuals with\ndisabilities therefore falls within the scope of Title II.” (quotations and citations omitted)); Johnson,\n151 F.3d at 570 (“Congress gave the Attorney General the task of developing regulations to\nimplement Title II.  Because of this express delegation, these regulations are entitled to ‘controlling\nweight, unless they are arbitrary, capricious, or manifestly contrary to the statute.’” (quoting\nChevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 843-44 (1984)). \nFinally, as noted above, the UFAS guidelines promulgated under the Rehabilitation Act also impose\nmaterially identical architectural requirements for all construction carried out with federal funding\nby any state or local entity, and it is undisputed here that all of the sidewalks and curb ramps\ntargeted in this case were built with federal funds.\n2.  Sidewalks are “Services” Under the ADA\nEven if the sidewalks at issue were not “facilities” subject to the ADA, the program of\nbuilding and maintaining sidewalks certainly is a “service” provided by the defendant by any\ncoherent interpretation of that term.  No decision of the Supreme Court or any other federal court\nthat was cited by the parties has held otherwise.  And in the Fifth Circuit’s decision in Frame v. City\nof Arlington, 657 F.3d 215 (5th Cir. 2011), the court of appeals squarely confronted the question and\nheld that sidewalks do count as “services” for the purposes of ADA Title II.  \nWCRC’s contrary argument is based on a strained reading of Babcock v. Michigan.  But the\ncourt of appeals in that case avoided the question whether “sidewalks” are “services,” when it\nconsidered whether other features of an existing public building such as “handrails” could be\nconstrued to be services subject to Title II.  Babcock, 812 F.3d at 539 n.5 (noting that handrails are\nnot “design features” that “satisfy a ‘general demand’ for ‘safe transportation’ in the same way that\n-34-\n\na sidewalk does, “ and acknowledging that it was “hard-pressed to conclude that [handrails] qualify\nas ‘services,’ like sidewalks under the [Frame] majority’s approach”); see also id. at 543 (“While\nthe majority relies substantially on the reasoning of the Frame dissent, the majority in this case\ncarefully notes ways in which the case of sidewalks may be different from the building designs\nbefore us.  Ante, at 538 n.5.  Our decision today thus does not necessarily control a future case\ninvolving sidewalks.”) (Rogers, J., concurring).    \nMoreover, this Court explicitly rejected WCRC’s position on this issue on the previous\nopinion on the Rule 12 motions:\nAny sensible reading of ADA Title II compels the conclusion that maintaining public\npedestrian thoroughfares for citizens to get around a city — and access the many\npublic services and businesses located within — is the archetypal example of the\nmost fundamental of public services.  Inaccessible sidewalks are, in fact, the single\nmost readily conceivable example of a basic obstacle to accessibility that comes to\nmind when considering the purpose that animates the ADA, which is to eliminate\nobstacles to the full enjoyment of public life by disabled citizens.   See PGA Tour,\nInc. v. Martin, 532 U.S. 661, 675 (2001) (“To effectuate its sweeping purpose, the\nADA forbids discrimination against disabled individuals in major areas of public life\n. . . .”).  It is simply common sense: If disabled pedestrians cannot access the\nsidewalks, then they can hardly access anything else that a city has to offer.\nMote, 252 F. Supp. 3d at 654.  \n3.  Denial of “Services”\nAs noted below, there is evidence in the record identifying the specific ADAAG-violating\ndefects at several specific sidewalk intersections along Old US-12.  The plaintiffs also have alleged\nadequately that they were denied “meaningful access” to the service provided — or supposed to be\nprovided — by the defendant’s construction of those sidewalks, because they have pointed to\nspecific instances when they were prevented from accessing public events such as the City’s summer\nparade, or denied access to a public venue such as the Lake Pierce Boardwalk, due to the defects in\n-35-\n\nthe curb ramps along US-12.  Two of the plaintiffs even identified one instance where they were\nforced at great risk to traverse their intended route along US-12 by traveling along the roadway in\ntheir wheelchairs, at considerable risk due to the passing traffic, and with a “police escort,” because\nthey could not safely navigate the curb ramps along their route.  That presentation certainly suffices\nto suggest that the plaintiffs have been denied “meaningful access” to the service offered by a\nproperly constructed roadside pedestrian walkway.\n4.  Specific Defects\nAlthough the plaintiffs’ factual presentation in response to WCRC’s summary judgment\nmotion is not much more elucidating than its response to MDOT’s motion, the plaintiffs did attach\naffidavits from Derik Bollinger and Ray Schmidt, two superintendents of the City of Chelsea Public\nWorks Department, who inspected several of the intersections along US-12.  They reported their\nobservations of those intersections and some measurements of their features.  By applying what\nappeared to be the pertinent portions of the ADAAG to those observations, the Court  was able to\nreach its own conclusions on those points.  \nThe plaintiffs have identified at least three defects in the curb ramps at several of the\nintersections between sidewalks and the roadway on US-12, and those defects sufficiently suggest\nthat the curb ramps in question are not compliant with relevant provisions of the ADAAG.  Among\nother things, the plaintiffs’ inspectors stated their observations, based on an October 2016 inspection\nof several intersections, that several of the ramps within the scope of the work done in 2007 featured\ndefects such as (1) running slopes exceeding the 1 in 12 or 8.33% maximum allowed by the\nADAAG specifications, ADAAG 4.8.2 (“The maximum slope of a ramp in new construction shall\nbe 1:12.”); (2) transitions or “lips” at the transition from the ramp to the sidewalk exceeding the\n-36-\n\nmaximum allowable untreated vertical deviation of 1/2 inch, see ADAAG 4.3.8; 4.5.1-4.5.2; and (3)\npropensity for the ramps to allow water to accumulate, resulting in obstructive accumulations of dirt,\ndebris, mud, and grass, see ADAAG 4.8.8 (“Outdoor ramps and their approaches shall be designed\nso that water will not accumulate on walking surfaces.”). \nThe defendant contends that there is “no evidence” that the curb ramps in question were not\nfully ADA-compliant as built.  But of course that position necessarily disregards the evidence that\nthey are not compliant now, and, in the absence of any evidence to the contrary, a factfinder fairly\ncould infer that the curb ramps are too steeply sloped, obstructed by dangerous asphalt protrusions,\nand prone to accumulate water because they were designed and constructed to be so.  And the\ndefendant has not offered any evidence conclusively to rebut that inference.\nThe Plaintiffs have met their obligation under Rule 56 to establish a material fact issue for\ntrial. \n5.  Eliminated Curb Ramps\nThe plaintiffs also complain of one defect in particular at several intersections, which does\nnot comprise a violation of any ADAAG standard on point: the alleged “omission” of one pair of\nramps at some intersections.  The plaintiffs contend that the “omission” of a ramp to transition from\none of the two sidewalks along a side street that intersects with US-12 is non-ADAAG-compliant. \nBut they have not pointed to any ADAAG specification purporting to control the number or\norientation of ramps at an intersection.  Instead, the pertinent regulations merely require that (1)\n“[n]ewly constructed or altered streets, roads, and highways must contain curb ramps or other sloped\nareas at any intersection having curbs or other barriers to entry from a street level pedestrian\nwalkway,” and (2) “[n]ewly constructed or altered street level pedestrian walkways must contain\n-37-\n\ncurb ramps or other sloped areas at intersections to streets, roads, or highways.”  28 C.F.R. §\n35.151(i) (emphasis added).  \nIn this case, it is apparent that the configuration of the intersections in question does, in fact,\ninclude ramps at each spot where a sidewalk “intersects” a roadway.  In those locations where ramps\nwere omitted, the sidewalk in question terminates early, into the side of a perpendicular sidewalk\nrunning along US-12, and does not extend to the roadway.  The plaintiffs have not pointed to any\nauthority in the ADAAG or elsewhere mandating that the defendant construct sidewalks so that they\nintersect with a roadway at any particular point.  Instead, all that the regulations require is that where\na sidewalk does intersect with a road, a ramp must be installed.  In this case that obligation appears\nto be fulfilled at all of the locations in question.\n6.  Construction vs. Maintenance\nThe defendant contends that, even if the sidewalks that it built were defective according to\nthe ADDAG, it is not liable for their present condition because the issues identified are caused by\nlack of “maintenance” rather than as a consequence of improper “design” or “construction.”  But\nthe defendant has not offered any evidence to substantiate its position that the sidewalks properly\nwere designed and constructed in the first instance.  Instead, it merely posits, without any supporting\nevidence, that its efforts during the 2007 reconstruction project were ADA-compliant, and it invites\nthe Court to conclude that the defects that now exist must be due to lack of maintenance of the curbs\nand sidewalks, which it contends is exclusively the responsibility of the City after the construction\nwas completed.  The defendant points out that state law assigns to the City the responsibility of\nmaintaining sidewalks within its borders. Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. § 691.1402a(1) (“A municipal\n-38-\n\ncorporation in which a sidewalk is installed adjacent to a municipal, county, or state highway shall\nmaintain the sidewalk in reasonable repair.”). \n However, that statute does not answer in the first instance the question whether the\noffending curb ramps are defective because they were defectively designed and constructed, or\ninadequately “maintained.”  And the present record is insufficient for the Court to decide the issue\nas a matter of law.  As between the City and the County, the decision which is liable, and to what\nextent, for the identified defects will have to await the development of an adequate record on those\npoints at a trial before the Court.  WCRC is not entitled to a judgment as a matter of law on that\npoint.  \n7.  Statute of Limitations\nAccepting the defendant’s premise that the applicable statute of limitations for the ADA\nclaims here is three years, it is apparent from the record that the plaintiffs claims all are timely\nbecause all of them specifically alleged that they first encountered the accessibility defects described\nin the complaint within three years before this action was filed.  \n“Federal law . . . governs when the limitations period begins to run, that is, when a claim\naccrues.”  Helm v. Eells, 642 F. App’x 558, 561 (6th Cir. 2016) (citing Johnson v. Memphis Light\nGas & Water Div., 777 F.3d 838, 843 (6th Cir. 2015)).  “Under federal law, a claim accrues ‘when\nthe plaintiff knows or has reason to know of the injury which is the basis of his action.’”  Ibid. “A\nplaintiff has ‘reason to know’ of an injury if he or she ‘should have discovered it through the\nexercise of reasonable diligence.’”  Ibid.  “This is an objective inquiry, which looks ‘to what event\nshould have alerted the typical lay person to protect his or her rights.’”  Ibid. \n-39-\n\nNothing in the record suggests that any of the plaintiffs knew or had reason to know of any\ncurb ramp defects in the sidewalks along US-12 or M-52 more than three years before this civil\naction was commenced.\n8.  AACIL’s Standing\nStanding is required in order to confer subject matter jurisdiction upon federal courts under\nArticle III of the Constitution.  It is “the threshold question in every federal case.”  Warth v. Seldin,\n422 U.S. 490, 498 (1975).  The Supreme Court has stated that the standing requirement “limits\nfederal court jurisdiction to actual controversies so that the judicial process is not transformed into\n‘a vehicle for the vindication of the value interests of concerned bystanders.’”  Coal Operators &\nAssocs., Inc. v. Babbitt, 291 F.3d 912, 915-16 (6th Cir. 2002) (quoting Valley Forge Christian\nCollege v. Ams. United for Separation of Church & State, Inc., 454 U.S. 464, 473 (1982)).  \nOne of the three components necessary to establish standing to sue under Article III is the\ndemonstration of an injury in fact.  Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560 (1992) (stating\nthat a plaintiff also must show that the injury is “traceable” to the defendant’s conduct, and the\ninjury likely will be “redressed by a favorable judicial decision”).  “To establish injury in fact, a\nplaintiff must show that he or she suffered ‘an invasion of a legally protected interest’ that is\n‘concrete and particularized’ and ‘actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical.’”  Spokeo,\nInc. v. Robins, --- U.S. ---, 136 S. Ct. 1540, 1548 (2016) (quoting Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560).  “For an\ninjury to be ‘particularized,’ it ‘must affect the plaintiff in a personal and individual way.’”  Ibid. \n“A ‘concrete’ injury must be ‘de facto’; that is, it must actually exist.”  Ibid.  \nAn organization may have “associational standing” to sue on behalf of its members, “which\nexists if an association’s members have standing; if the interests at stake are relevant to the\n-40-\n\norganization’s purpose; and if the claims and relief do not require the participation of individual\nmembers.”  Barry v. Lyon, 834 F.3d 706, 716 (6th Cir. 2016) (citing Friends of the Earth, Inc. v.\nLaidlaw Environmental Services (TOC), Inc., 528 U.S. 167, 181 (2000)).  However, “[i]n addition\nto suing on behalf of its members, an entity may sue ‘on its own behalf because it has suffered a\npalpable injury as a result of the defendants’ actions.’”  Northeastern Ohio Coalition for the\nHomeless v. Husted, 837 F.3d 612, 624 (6th Cir. 2002) (quoting MX Group, Inc. v. City of\nCovington, 293 F.3d 326, 332-33 (6th Cir. 2002)).\nThe record before the Court adequately establishes that AACIL has standing to proceed on\nits own behalf in this litigation, regardless of whether it has “associational standing” to proceed on\nbehalf of any of its individual disabled clients.  The testimony of its CEO establishes that the\norganization has suffered by having to divert its resources toward attempts to secure ADA\ncompliance by the defendants, and that diversion of resources has impacted its capacity to provide\nthe range of other services that it offers to disabled persons, including education, counseling, and\nadvocacy.  On similar facts, the Supreme Court has found that an advocacy organization for the\nhomeless had standing to proceed against the defendants in a discrimination action, where its\ncomplaint alleged that the organization had been “frustrated by defendants’ racial steering practices\nin its efforts to assist equal access to housing through counseling and other referral services,” and\nthat the organization “had to devote significant resources to identify and counteract the defendants’\nracially discriminatory steering practices.” Havens Realty Corp. v. Coleman, 455 U.S. 363, 379\n(1982) (quotation marks and alterations omitted).  As the Court explained:\nIf, as broadly alleged, petitioners’ steering practices have perceptibly impaired\nHOME’s  ability  to  provide  counseling  and  referral  services  for  low-and\nmoderate-income homeseekers, there can be no question that the organization has\nsuffered injury in fact.  Such concrete and demonstrable injury to the organization’s\n-41-\n\nactivities — with the consequent drain on the organization’s resources — constitutes\nfar more than simply a setback to the organization’s abstract social interests.  We\ntherefore conclude . . . that in view of HOME’s allegations of injury it was improper\nfor the District Court to dismiss for lack of standing the claims of the organization\nin its own right.\nHavens Realty, 455 U.S. at 379 (citing Sierra Club v. Morton, 405 U.S. 727, 739 (1972)).  \nAACIL’s executive director testified to circumstances that rendered the injury adequately\nparticularized, where she explained that AACIL’s resources have been diverted from its usual\nmission as a result of its participation in pre-litigation advocacy relating to the precise accessibility\ndefects alleged by the individual plaintiffs in this case, and that the burden only has increased due\nto the defendants’ resistance in the course of this litigation.  And contrary to the defendants’\ncontention, there is no threshold of “significance” of the injury to the organization that must be\nexceeded to render the harm sufficiently concrete under Article III.  The Supreme Court has held\nthat even unquantifiable and intangible harms may qualify as injuries in fact, and, as in the Court\nheld in Havens, the impairment of the organizations operations needs only to be “perceptible” to\nsuffice.  Havens, 455 U.S. at 379; see also Spokeo, 136 S. Ct. at 1549;\nD.  City of Chelsea’s Summary Judgment Motion\nThe City of Chelsea has moved for summary judgment on its third-party complaint against\nWCRC, alleging that it is entitled as a matter of law to a declaration that WCRC is liable for the\ncondition of any sidewalks or curb cuts within the US-12 right of way.  However, as noted above,\nthe state of Michigan imposes an affirmative duty by statute on the City to maintain sidewalks within\nits boundaries.  See Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. § 691.1402a(1).  The ADA regulations also impose an\nexpress requirement on a responsible public entity to “maintain in operable working condition those\nfeatures of facilities and equipment that are required to be readily accessible to and usable by\n-42-\n\npersons with disabilities by the Act or this part.”  28 C.F.R. § 35.133(a) (emphasis added).  As\nbetween the City and the County, the present evidentiary record is insufficient to allow the Court\nto hold as a matter of law that the City has no liability for maintenance of the sidewalks in question,\nif, in fact, some of the present accessibility defects are due to deterioration of ADA-compliant\nconstruction over time, coupled with a lack of maintenance, instead of defective construction or\ndesign.\nMoreover, the City cannot escape liability for the condition of the sidewalks and curb ramps\nmerely because it was the County and not the City that carried out the original work, because the\nADA regulations impose obligations on a public entity to ensure that accessibility features are\nincorporated and that the ADAAG specifications are complied with any time that a public facility\nis altered or newly constructed, after 1992, “‘by, on behalf of, or for the use of a public entity in a\nmanner that affects or could affect the usability of the facility or part of the facility’”  Ability Center,\n385 F.3d at 904 (quoting 28 C.F.R. § 35.151(b)) (emphasis added).  The “project log” and the letter\nregarding the permit process that were submitted by defendant WCRC plainly suggest that the City\nwas involved at the very least in issuing required permits to allow the project to proceed, and it is\na fair inference from the record that the sidewalks and curb ramps were constructed either “on behalf\nof” or “for the use of” the City, despite the funding of the project with state and federal funds and\nthe handling of the work by the County authority.  And the City has not pointed to any authority\nsuggesting that it cannot be held jointly liable with the County for any resulting ADA defects in the\nsidewalks and curb ramps under those circumstances.\n-43-\n\nIII.\nAlthough the sovereign immunity defenses asserted by defendant MDOT lack merit, the\nplaintiffs have not offered evidence to satisfy their burden under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure\n56(c) of demonstrating a material fact issue for trial.  Their claims against MDOT, therefore, fail as\na matter of law.  MDOT has not offered good reason for the Court to reconsider its order striking\nits latest brief; its motion for reconsideration will be denied.  Although the plaintiffs have met their\nRule 56(c) burden on most of their claims against defendant WCRC, they have not demonstrated\nan entitlement to relief for their claim that certain curb ramps along Old U.S. 12 were eliminated\nduring reconstruction.  That claim will be dismissed.  Fact disputes preclude summary judgment for\nthe City of Chelsea on its third-party complaint against WCRC.  \nAccordingly, it is ORDERED that defendant Washtenaw County Road Commission’s\nmotion for summary judgment [dkt. #48] is GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART.

MOTE, DEBORAH CLARK,\nCARLOS GRAY-LION, BRENDA BARANIAK,\nKAREN STREET, MERLYN STREET,\nLEE BENTON, by his next friends RONALD M.\nBENTON and MARION BENTON, J.N., a minor, Case Number 16-11546\nby his next friends DANIEL and MARY JANE Honorable David M. Lawson\nNELSON, ANN ARBOR CENTER FOR\nINDEPENDENT LIVING, INC., and\nJENNIFER KUNDAK,\nPlaintiffs,\nv.\nCITY OF CHELSEA, CHELSEA DOWNTOWN\nDEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY, and MICHIGAN\nDEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION,\nDefendants,\nand\nCITY OF CHELSEA,\nThird-party plaintiff,\nv.\nWASHTENAW COUNTY ROAD COMMISSION,\nThird-party defendant.\n___________________________________________/\nCORRECTED OPINION AND ORDER DENYING MOTIONS FOR JUDGMENT\nON THE PLEADINGS, AND GRANTING PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION TO AMEND\nTHE COMPLAINT AND JOINT MOTION TO APPROVE THE CONSENT DECREE\nThis case concerns the sidewalks, curbs, and intersections in the City of Chelsea, Michigan,\nand their accessibility to persons with disabilities.  The plaintiffs — Shauna Mote and several other\ndisabled individuals, joined by the Ann Arbor Center for Independent Living — filed this lawsuit\nunder the Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA) alleging that the City of Chelsea and its\n\nDowntown Development Authority (DDA), along with the Michigan Department of Transportation\n(MDOT), have created or facilitated violations of the ADA within certain public pedestrian areas\nin the City by allowing businesses to renovate storefronts without including appropriate accessibility\nmeasures, and by removing previously constructed physical accommodations for wheelchair users,\nsuch as curb ramps at some intersections.  \nThe plaintiffs initially sued the public entities they believed have jurisdiction over the\nfacilities in question.  Chelsea obtained leave to file a third-party complaint against the Washtenaw\nCounty Road Commission (WCRC), alleging that the responsibility for regulating and maintaining\none of the main roadways through the City (“Old U.S. Highway 12”), which is the locale of certain\nalleged accessibility defects described in the complaint, rests entirely with that agency and is beyond\nthe purview of the City or its zoning authorities.  In the meantime, the plaintiffs and Chelsea and its\nDDA have reached a settlement, which they have presented as a proposed consent decree.  The\nMDOT takes no position on that request, but the WCRC opposes it.  \nPresently before the Court are motions (1) for judgment on the pleadings by defendant\nMDOT; (2) for judgment on the pleadings by third-party defendant WCRC; (3) for entry of a\nconsent decree filed jointly by the plaintiffs and defendants City of Chelsea; and (4) for leave to file\na second amended complaint by the plaintiffs that would add the WCRC as a principal defendant\nand elaborate claims directly against that entity premised on the same facts alleged in the original\ncomplaint concerning certain roadways within the City of Chelsea.  The Court heard argument on\nJanuary 5, 2017.  The pleadings state plausible claims against all of the public entities under Title\nII of the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.  Bringing the WCRC into the dispute as a main\ndefendant clarifies the issues, properly aligns the parties, and will not prejudice anyone.  There is\n-2-\n\nno good reason not to allow the settlement between Chelsea and the plaintiffs.  Therefore, the Court\nwill deny the motions for judgment on the pleadings, grant the motion to approve the settlement, and\ngrant the plaintiffs’ motion to file a second amended complaint.  Because of the delay in ruling on\nthese motions, the Court will entertain the parties’ proposals to adjust the present scheduling order. \nI.\nAccording to the first amended complaint, the individual plaintiffs are disabled persons, who\nlive, work, or frequently travel to and within the City of Chelsea, Michigan, and who each require\nthe use of a wheelchair, braces, cane, or other assistive devices in order to get around.  Plaintiff Ann\nArbor Center for Independent Living is an association that represents disabled persons such as the\nplaintiffs throughout southeastern Michigan, including in Chelsea.  Together, and on behalf of\npersons similarly situated, the individual and association plaintiffs complain that the public streets\nand sidewalks in the City of Chelsea recently have become less than fully accessible to them due\nto City approvals of renovations by private businesses adjacent to public sidewalks and streets\nmaking those facilities inaccessible, and because of construction and renovation work done on\npublic sidewalks and streets by the City of Chelsea, the WCRC, and MDOT, which either removed\nor omitted accessibility features.  In particular, the plaintiffs claim that the City has allowed\nbusinesses to renovate their storefronts by installing new steps that create barriers to access for\nwheelchair users, where ramps previously allowed them to enter those businesses, and that the City\n(or other defendant agencies) have removed existing ramps and curb cuts and replaced them with\ngrass or solid curbs at certain intersections.  \n-3-\n\nThe plaintiffs assert that all of the accessibility defects of which they complain are located\nwithin the City of Chelsea, and that many of the alleged violations concern the public streets and\nsidewalks along Michigan State Route 52 (which, within the City limits, is also known as “Main\nStreet” and is the principal auto and pedestrian route through the city center).  They charge that the\nalleged “defective construction and alterations, combined with insufficient maintenance and\nenforcement — have continuously failed to ensure that [the defendants’] sidewalks, street crossings,\nstreet level transit stops, and certain other facilities, services, programs and activities are readily\nusable by and accessible to Plaintiffs and others.”  \nPlaintiff Deborah Clark uses a wheelchair and the aid of a service dog.  She recently moved\nto Chelsea and discovered that she could not safely access the City’s sidewalks, street crossings, and\nmunicipal parking.  Also, she found that many downtown businesses lack an accessible entrance,\nand even the public library is inaccessible to her.  She also cannot safely use many sidewalks and\nstreet crossings due to accessibility barriers.  \nPlaintiff Shauna Mote recently tried to use the City’s new Jackson Street parking lot, which\nwas built in 2014, but she was unable to do so because the driveway and walkways connecting the\nlot to Middle Street are too steep for her safely to traverse.  \nPlaintiffs Carlos Gray-Lion and Karen and Merlyn Street recently learned that the City\nremoved long existing curb cuts that they had used on Congdon Street and Wilkinson street, and\nreplaced them with inaccessible grassy areas or solid curbs.  \nEach year the City and its DDA sponsor several festivals and parades.  The individual\nplaintiffs all have been unable to attend or fully participate in these events due to the lack of\naccessible public parking, as well as mobility barriers on City sidewalks and streets.   \n-4-\n\nThe MDOT has principal responsibility for maintaining the M-52 roadway, including the\nportion that comprises Main Street in the City, but it permits the City to do certain work on adjacent\nsidewalks and curbs.  At various times after January 16, 1992 (the effective date of the applicable\nversion of the ADA Accessibility Guidelines), MDOT has performed maintenance and new\nconstruction in the M-52 corridor, including re-paving the roadway from curb line to curb line and\nconstructing or repairing sidewalks and curbs.  Despite these renovations and new construction\nprojects, MDOT has left in place a number of inaccessible curbs at pedestrian crosswalks.  MDOT\nalso has permitted the City to construct or alter adjacent sidewalks and curbs along Main Street,\nwhich suffer similar accessibility defects.  MDOT also allows on-street parking along Main Street,\nand has striped parking spaces for that purpose.  According to the first amended complaint, none of\nthat parking is ADA-compliant because it is obstructed by, among other things, excessive slopes or\nobstructive lips between the street and sidewalks, as well as holes and other defects in the pavement\nor curb ramps.  \nIn 2015 the City re-paved Congdon street and, in the process, removed two curb cuts at the\npedestrian cross-walk at the intersection with Lincoln Avenue.  The City also stopped its resurfacing\nproject just short of an intersection with Middle Street, in order to avoid doing work that would have\nrequired the City to install curb cuts at cross-walks there.  \nAlso in 2015, MDOT awarded the City a “Safe Route to Schools” grant (which included\nfederal funds) to improve accessibility and safety in several public pedestrian corridors within the\nCity.  However, in addition to using those funds to build new cross-walks and signals, and to create\nsome accessible curb ramps, the City also spent some of the money to remove other, long-existing\ncurb cuts and ramps, replacing them with inaccessible features.  \n-5-\n\nIn 2014 the City constructed and opened its Jackson Street parking lot, which included a\ndriveway and walkway connecting the public parking areas to the street.  The parking facility,\nhowever, is inaccessible due to extreme slopes in the driveway and walkway.  \nFinally, since 1992, the City has maintained a number of public municipal parking lots and\nspaces for on-street parking along various city streets.  The City has added or altered many of those\nmunicipal parking lots and on-street parking spaces that include spots designated as parking for\nwheelchair users.  However, all of the designated spaces are inaccessible for various reasons,\nincluding excessive slopes, insufficient width per the ADA guidelines, and lack of adequate or level\nspace to deploy a vehicle wheelchair ramp. \nIn its third-party complaint, the City alleges that it is bisected by two main roadways that are\nnot fully under its control and regulation.  As previously noted, one of the streets is M-52 (“Main\nStreet”), which the City contends is maintained and regulated by MDOT.  The City alleges that the\nother major bisecting roadway is County Road Old U.S. 12, which is subject to the exclusive\njurisdiction and control of the WCRC.  The City admits that it constructed two pedestrian crossings\non Old U.S. 12 since 1992, and it asserts that it did so with a permit from the County.  But the City\ncontends that, to the extent that the plaintiffs complain of any other defects involving sidewalks or\npedestrian cross-walks along the Old U.S. 12 corridor, any declaratory or injunctive relief obtained\nmust be directed to the WCRC, because it has — and has exercised — exclusive control over the\nconditions and construction of the street, sidewalks, curbs, and crossings along that route.\nThe plaintiffs’ initial putative class-action complaint and related responses and orders were\nstruck because those documents improperly included the full name of an individual plaintiff who\nis a minor.  The plaintiffs subsequently re-filed a corrected amended complaint naming that\n-6-\n\nindividual only by his initials.  The amended complaint alleges violations of ADA Title II (Count\nI) and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Count II) against the City of Chelsea, the City’s Downtown\nDevelopment Authority, and MDOT.  The complaint also raises a congruent claim against the City\nof Chelsea only under Michigan’s Persons With Disabilities Civil Rights Act (PWDCRA).  The City\nof Chelsea sought leave to file a third-party complaint against the WCRC, which the City contends\nhas exclusive control over and responsibility for certain roadways within its city limits.  Defendant\nMDOT filed an answer to the original complaint and a motion for judgment on the pleadings;\nWCRC responded in similar fashion to the third-party complaint.  The plaintiffs later filed a joint\nmotion for entry of consent decree with the concurrence of the City of Chelsea, and a motion for\nleave to file a second amended complaint to name WCRC as a principal defendant. \nII.\nA motion for judgment on the pleadings under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(c) applies\nthe same standards that govern motions to dismiss filed under Rule 12(b)(6).  See Fed. R. Civ. P.\n12(c); Vickers v. Fairfield Med. Ctr., 453 F.3d 757, 761 (6th Cir. 2006); Ziegler v. IBP Hog Mkt.,\nInc., 249 F.3d 509, 511-12 (6th Cir. 2001).  The standards are well known to the parties: the purpose\nof the motion is to allow a defendant to test whether, as a matter of law, the plaintiff is entitled to\nlegal relief if all the facts and allegations in the complaint are taken as true.” Rippy ex rel. Rippy v.\nHattaway, 270 F.3d 416, 419 (6th Cir. 2001) (citing Mayer v. Mylod, 988 F.2d 635, 638 (6th Cir.\n1993)).  The complaint is viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, the allegations in the\ncomplaint are accepted as true, and all reasonable inferences are drawn in favor of the plaintiff. \nBassett v. Nat’l Collegiate Athletic Ass’n, 528 F.3d 426, 430 (6th Cir. 2008).  To survive the motion,\nthe plaintiffs “must plead ‘enough factual matter’ that, when taken as true, ‘state[s] a claim to relief\n-7-\n\nthat is plausible on its face.’  Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 556, 570 (2007).  Plausibility\nrequires showing more than the ‘sheer possibility’ of relief but less than a ‘probab[le]’ entitlement\nto relief.  Ashcroft v. Iqbal, [556 U.S. 662, 678] (2009).”  Fabian v. Fulmer Helmets, Inc., 628 F.3d\n278, 280 (6th Cir. 2010).  \nAt this stage of the case, the Court must accept as true the pleaded facts, but not factual\nconclusions unless they are plausibly supported by the pleaded facts.  “[B]are assertions,” such as\nthose that “amount to nothing more than a ‘formulaic recitation of the elements’” of a claim, can\nprovide context to the factual allegations, but are insufficient to state a claim for relief and must be\ndisregarded.  Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 681 (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555).  However, as long as a\ncourt can “‘draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged,’\na plaintiff’s claims must survive a motion to dismiss.”  Fabian, 628 F.3d at 281 (quoting Iqbal, 556\nU.S. at 678).\nA.\nUnder Title II of the ADA, “no qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of such\ndisability, be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services, programs, or\nactivities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any such entity.”   42 U.S.C. §\n12132.  “‘Public entity’ includes ‘any state or local government’ and ‘any department, agency,\nspecial purpose district, or other instrumentality of a State or States or local government.’”  Ability\nCenter of Greater Toledo v. City of Sandusky, 385 F.3d 901, 904 (6th Cir. 2004) (quoting 42 U.S.C.\n§ 12131(1)(A) & (B)).  “[Section 204 of the] Act grants the Attorney General authority to\npromulgate regulations to implement its provisions.”  Ibid. (citing 42 U.S.C. § 12134).  “Pursuant\nto § 204, the Attorney General adopted 28 C.F.R. § 35.151, which provides that alterations of\n-8-\n\nfacilities commenced after January 26, 1992, ‘by, on behalf of, or for the use of a public entity in\na manner that affects or could affect the usability of the facility or part of the facility shall, to the\nmaximum extent feasible, be altered in such manner that the altered portion of the facility is readily\naccessible and usable by individuals with disabilities.’”  Ibid. (quoting 28 C.F.R. § 35.151(b)).  The\nterm “facility” is defined under the applicable ADA regulations to include “all or any portion of\nbuildings, structures, sites, complexes, equipment, rolling stock or other conveyances, roads, walks,\npassageways, parking lots, or other real or personal property, including the site where the building,\nproperty, structure, or equipment is located.”  28 C.F.R. § 35.104.\n“To be ‘readily accessible,’ any part of a newly constructed or altered facility must be\nconstructed in conformance with the Americans with Disabilities Act Accessibility Guidelines for\nBuildings and Facilities (ADAAG), 28 C.F.R. Pt. 36, App. A, or with the Uniform Federal\nAccessibility Standards (UFAS), 41 C.F.R. Pt. 101-19.6, App. A.”  Daubert v. Lindsay Unified Sch.\nDist., 760 F.3d 982, 986 (9th Cir. 2014) (citing 28 C.F.R. § 35.151(c)(1)-(3)).  “The ADAAG is a\ncomprehensive  set  of  structural  guidelines  that  articulates  detailed  design  requirements  to\naccommodate persons with disabilities.”  Ibid.  “Section 35.151 is part of a broader regulatory\nscheme that aims to effectuate § 202 of the ADA.”  Ability Center, 385 F.3d at 904.  “The scheme\nmakes explicit that ‘no qualified individual with a disability shall, because a public entity’s facilities\nare inaccessible to or unusable by individuals with disabilities, be excluded from participation in,\nor be denied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities of a public entity, or be subjected\nto discrimination by any public entity.’”  Ibid. (quoting 28 C.F.R. § 35.149).  \nSection 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 states that “[n]o otherwise qualified individual\nwith a disability . . . shall, solely by reason of her or his disability, be excluded from the participation\n-9-\n\nin, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity\nreceiving Federal financial assistance.”  29 U.S.C. § 794(a).  “[T]he remedies, procedures, and rights\navailable under Title II of the ADA parallel those available under [The Rehabilitation Act].”  Ability\nCenter, 385 F.3d at 905 & n.7 (citing 29 U.S.C. 794a(a)(2); Barnes v. Gorman, 536 U.S. 181, 189\nn.3 (2002); Johnson v. City of Saline, 151 F.3d 564, 573 (6th Cir. 1998)).  Thus, the Sixth Circuit\nhas explained that its “analysis of Rehabilitation Act claims ‘roughly parallels’ ADA claims because\nthe statutes contain similar language and are ‘quite similar in purpose and scope.’”  Babcock, 812\nF.3d at 540 (quoting McPherson v. Michigan High School Athletic Association, Inc., 119 F.3d 453,\n459-60 (6th Cir. 1997)).\nThe  same  can  be  said  of  the  Michigan  Persons  With  Disabilities  Civil  Rights  Act\n(PWDCRA).  It “‘substantially mirrors the ADA, and resolution of a plaintiff’s ADA claim will\ngenerally, though not always, resolve the plaintiff’s PWDCRA claim.’”  Donald v. Sybra, Inc., 667\nF.3d 757, 764 (6th Cir. 2012) (quoting Cotter v. Ajilon Servs., Inc., 287 F.3d 593, 597 (6th Cir.\n2002)).\nThe motions by MDOT and WCRC are based primarily on their reading of Babcock v.\nMichigan, 812 F.3d 531 (6th Cir. 2016).  That case concerned the accessibility by disabled people\nto Cadillac Place, the former General Motors Corporation world headquarters building that the State\nof Michigan acquired to be used as offices for several state agencies.  The building, designed by the\nrenowned architect Albert Kahn, was constructed between 1919 and 1923.  The plaintiff in that case\nwas an employee of one of the state agencies, and she alleged that certain design features of the\nbuilding violated Title II of the ADA because they denied her access to her place of employment. \nId. at 533.  The court held that the plaintiff failed to state a claim under the ADA, because she\n-10-\n\n“failed to identify any ‘services, programs, or activities’ of a public entity from which she was\nexcluded or denied a benefit.”  Ibid.  Distinguishing “between services, programs, or activities and\nthe facilities in which they are administered,” the court reasoned that the ADA does not protect mere\naccess to pubic buildings; instead, “Title II’s private right of action is specifically intended to\nremedy interference with a disabled individual’s participation in, or benefitting from, a public\nservice, program, or activity” conducted within a public building.  Id. at 535 (citing San Francisco\nv. Sheehan, ---U.S. ---, 135 S. Ct. 1765, 1773 (2015)).  The court concluded that “facility\naccessibility is not, standing alone, a cognizable claim under Title II’s private right of action; rather,\nthe inquiry is tied to whether that facility’s inaccessibility interferes with access to public services,\nprograms, or activities.”  Id. at 536.  \nExtrapolating from this holding, defendant MDOT and third-party defendant WCRC argue\nthat (1) in order to raise a viable claim against a public entity under Title II of the ADA, a plaintiff\nmust allege not only that a “facility” is inaccessible, but also that, as a consequence of the alleged\ninaccessibility, he or she was denied the full benefit of some “service” provided by the defendants,\n(2) sidewalks, parking spaces, and roadways are “facilities” and not “services,” and the complaint\nalleges nothing more than that certain sidewalks, roadways, and parking areas within the city limits\ndo not conform with applicable ADA Accessibility Guidelines, and (3) therefore, because the\ncomplaint alleges nothing more than technical accessibility defects in certain “facilities,” the\npleadings are insufficient as a matter of law to state any claim against any public entity defendant. \nThis argument is flawed for several reasons.  \nFirst, the MDOT and WCRC ignore the command of 28 C.F.R. § 35.151.  The crux of the\nplaintiffs’ amended complaint is that, due to numerous specific accessibility defects in the curbs,\n-11-\n\nroadways, parking spaces and lots, and sidewalks within the City of Chelsea, they are unable safely\nto navigate the City’s pedestrian throughways, and they have been denied the full enjoyment and\nbenefit of the City’s public services such as municipal parking, parades, and City-sponsored\nfestivals.  The plaintiffs also allege that the sidewalk and curb defects make it impossible for them\nto traverse some public pedestrian routes at all, or to access certain public buildings such as the\nlibrary.  They contend that the problems have in some cases been caused by the removal of\naccessibility features that already were present.  And they maintain that the City, State, and County\nall have ignored the positive, specific mandate of 28 C.F.R. § 35.151, which required those entities,\nwhen building or repairing various public sidewalks after January 1992, affirmatively to ensure that\nthe design and construction of those features adhered to specific technical provisions of the ADA\nAccessibility Guidelines.  \nThe plaintiffs contend that the defendants — severally and jointly — have engaged in\nsubstantial construction or reconstruction projects within the city limits in recent years, and they\nrepeatedly have failed or refused to incorporate specific accessibility features mandated by the\nADAAG.  It has been widely accepted by the federal courts, including the Supreme Court, that\nsection 35.151 imposes a specific mandate on public entities to comply with the ADAAG in all new\nconstruction projects:\nAs Title II’s implementing regulations make clear, the reasonable modification\nrequirement can be satisfied in a number of ways. In the case of facilities built or\naltered after 1992, the regulations require compliance with specific architectural\naccessibility standards.  28 C.F.R. § 35.151 (2003).  But in the case of older\nfacilities, for which structural change is likely to be more difficult, a public entity\nmay comply with Title II by adopting a variety of less costly measures, including\nrelocating services to alternative, accessible sites and assigning aides to assist\npersons with disabilities in accessing services.  § 35.150(b)(1).  Only if these\nmeasures are ineffective in achieving accessibility is the public entity required to\nmake reasonable structural changes.\n-12-\n\nTennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509, 532 (2004) (emphasis added).\nThe State and County defendants contend that they are obligated under state law only to\nmaintain the paved driving surface of the roads within their respective rights of way, and that they\nhave no duty to maintain sidewalks in any accessible condition — or, indeed, to provide any\nsidewalks at all.  That may be true.  But the complaint alleges — and the defendants do not dispute,\nat least for the purposes of these motions — that the State and County authorities have in fact\nundertaken on their own authority to build, rebuild, alter, and maintain sidewalks along at least some\nportions of M-52 and Old U.S. 12 after January 1992.  All of those new construction and alterations\nprojects plainly were subject to the mandate that “[e]ach facility or part of a facility constructed by,\non behalf of, or for the use of a public entity shall be designed and constructed in such manner that\nthe facility or part of the facility is readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities,\nif the construction was commenced after January 26, 1992.”  28 C.F.R. § 35.151(a)(1); see also 28\nC.F.R. 35.150(b)(1) (“A public entity, in making alterations to existing buildings, shall meet the\naccessibility requirements of § 35.151.”).  Section 35.151 further expressly requires, with respect\nto “curb ramps” that “(1) Newly constructed or altered streets, roads, and highways must contain\ncurb ramps or other sloped areas at any intersection having curbs or other barriers to entry from a\nstreet level pedestrian walkway,” and “(2) Newly constructed or altered street level pedestrian\nwalkways must contain curb ramps or other sloped areas at intersections to streets, roads, or\nhighways.”  28 C.F.R. § 35.151(i).  The plaintiffs plainly allege that the defendants have built or\nrebuilt curbs, sidewalks, and parking spaces without regard to those specific statutory requirements,\nand that, in some cases, the defendants have removed accessibility features that already were\npresent, in order to replace them with accessibility obstacles.\n-13-\n\nSecond, the County and State defendants contend that under Babcock, “sidewalks” are\n“facilities,” not “services,” and they insist that the amended complaint is fatally flawed because it\ndoes not identify a service, program, or activity from which they were excluded. The defendants\nessentially contend that they have no obligation at all under the ADA — even in the case of new\nconstruction  —  to  include  any  specific  accessibility  features  in  any  sidewalk  or  roadway\nconstruction project.  But Babcock did not adopt any such counterintuitive reading of the ADA, and\nthe defendants’ position is sharply rebuked by both the plain language of the statute and by decades\nof case law.\nFor starters, the State and County defendants’ position ignores the most apparent dispositive\ndistinction between this case and Babcock: Babcock only involved complaints of accessibility\ndefects in an existing facility, not new construction.  Babcock, 812 F.3d at 536 (“ADA regulations\naddressing existing facilities provide that a public entity may comply with the ADA without altering\na structure, such as by ‘reassignment of services to accessible buildings, assignment of aides to\nbeneficiaries, home visits, delivery of services at alternate accessible sites . . . or any other methods\nthat result in making its services, programs, or activities readily accessible.’” (citing 28 C.F.R. §\n35.150(b), and 28 C.F.R. § 39.150(a)(1) (“noting that programs or activities must be ‘readily\naccessible to and usable by handicapped persons,’ but it is not ‘necessarily require[d that] the agency\nmake each of its existing facilities accessible to and usable by handicapped persons.’”)) (emphasis\nadded); see also Cohen v. City of Culver City, 754 F.3d 690, 699 (9th Cir. 2014) (“Sections 35.150\nand 35.151 both implement, in different circumstances, the ADA’s requirement that public entities\nmake reasonable modifications to accommodate persons with disabilities.  The less stringent\ndemands of § 35.150 govern when it would be unreasonable to expect public entities to comply with\n-14-\n\nthe more exacting standards of § 35.151.”); Greer v. Richardson Indep. Sch. Dist., 472 F. App’x\n287, 300 (5th Cir. 2012) (“The parking lot and the ramp have both been modified or constructed\nafter 1992 and thus do not fall within the more flexible guidelines for existing facilities.  Instead,\nthe ADAAG guidelines apply.”).\nThe majority opinion in Babcock did not discuss, or even cite, section 35.151, which imposes\na more demanding and specific standard on newly constructed or altered public facilities, as opposed\nto older existing facilities that were built before 1992.  As the Supreme Court noted in Tennessee\nv. Lane, and as the Sixth Circuit plainly held in Ability Center of Greater Toledo v. City of Sandusky,\n385 F.3d 901 (6th Cir. 2004), section 35.151 imposes a positive mandate to ensure that all newly\nconstructed public “facilities” — and in particular streets and sidewalks comprising pedestrian travel\nroutes — include certain specific accessibility features:\nPursuant to § 204, the Attorney General adopted 28 C.F.R. § 35.151, which provides\nthat alterations of facilities commenced after January 26, 1992, “by, on behalf of, or\nfor the use of a public entity in a manner that affects or could affect the usability of\nthe facility or part of the facility shall, to the maximum extent feasible, be altered in\nsuch manner that the altered portion of the facility is readily accessible and usable\nby individuals with disabilities.”  Id. § 35.151(b).  The regulation further specifies\nthat alterations should meet certain accessibility standards, id. § 35.151(c), and that\naltered streets and pedestrian walkways must contain curb ramps.  Id. § 35.151(e). \nSection 35.151 is part of a broader regulatory scheme that aims to effectuate § 202\nof the ADA.  See 28 C.F.R. § 35.101.\nAbility Center, 385 F.3d at 904 (emphasis added).  The Sixth Circuit, relying on Ability Center, later\nconsidered and squarely rejected the position that the State and County now take here, holding\ninstead that a plaintiff has “a private right of action to pursue her claims based on the failure of [a\ncity] to comply with regulations concerning the accessibility of facilities.”  Dillery v. City of\nSandusky, 398 F.3d 562, 567 (6th Cir. 2005), abrogated on other grounds by Anderson v. City of\nBlue Ash, 798 F.3d 338, 357 n.1 (6th Cir. 2015) (“Our test for intentional discrimination under Title\n-15-\n\nII of the ADA previously required that the discrimination be ‘solely’ because of the plaintiff’s\ndisability, [see Dillery, 398 F.3d at 567], but our decision in Lewis v. Humboldt Acquisition Corp.,\n681 F.3d 312, 317 (6th Cir. 2012) (en banc), rejected this sole-causation requirement.”).  The Dillery\ncourt held that the “[d]efendants’ argument that Dillery does not have a private cause of action to\npursue relief based on the ADA’s accessibility regulations fails based on Ability Center.”  Ibid.  \nThe Babcock panel did not abrogate or overrule Ability Center or Dillery — nor could it have\n— and the panel did not even suggest that it took issue with those binding, published decisions.  In\nfact, in a footnote, the majority in Babcock carefully distinguished between complaints relating only\nto alleged defects in a “facility” comprising one specific public building — which the plaintiff had\nfailed to allege was the home of any public service of interest to her — as compared with allegations\nof accessibility defects in public sidewalks, which the majority viewed as a hybrid of “facility” and\n“service” traditionally maintained by municipal entities.  Babcock, 812 F.3d at 539 n.5.  Discussing\nthe competing opinions in Frame v. City of Arlington, 657 F.3d 215 (5th Cir. 2011) (en banc), the\nBabcock majority acknowledged that “the Frame majority emphasized that the public has a ‘general\ndemand’ for ‘safe transportation,’ and so a ‘sidewalk’ qualifies as a ‘service.’”  Babcock, 812 F.3d\nat 539 n.5.  The court declined to apply that reasoning to the general building features of Cadillac\nPlace, because “[those] design features are not ordinarily ‘provided in common to all citizens,’ so\nwe are hard-pressed to conclude that they qualify as ‘services,’ like sidewalks under the Fifth Circuit\nmajority’s approach.”  Ibid.  Morever, Judge Rogers in his concurrence specifically noted that\nBabcock left open the question whether “sidewalks” comprise “services” within the meaning of the\nADA, and opined that they almost certainly do:\nWhile the majority relies substantially on the reasoning of the Frame dissent, the\nmajority in this case carefully notes ways in which the case of sidewalks may be\n-16-\n\ndifferent from the building designs before us.  Ante, at 538 n.5.  Our decision today\nthus does not necessarily control a future case involving sidewalks.  There is some\nroom for the possibility that sidewalks may qualify as services even if the design\nfeatures of a building do not.  A city’s sidewalks are more critical to the everyday\ntransportation needs of the general public than are the design features of a specific\nbuilding.  The conclusion that sidewalks may qualify as a service is supported by a\n2004 decision from this court, a Title II implementing regulation, and the Justice\nDepartment’s amicus briefs in several sidewalk cases.  Our judgment today does not\nresolve the question.\nBabcock, 812 F.3d at 543 (Rogers, J., concurring) (emphasis added).\nThird, the defendants’ position that they have no obligation to comply with the specific\nmandates of the ADAAG in constructing or altering new public sidewalks has been solidly rejected\nby the federal courts that have considered it.  Those courts repeatedly have held that when a public\nentity “builds new sidewalks or alters existing ones for reasons other than retrofitting to achieve\nADA compliance, § 35.151 plainly requires it to build a curb ramp at every intersection unless doing\nso would be structurally impracticable.”  Cohen, 754 F.3d at 698 (citing   28 C.F.R. § 35.151(i); see\nalso Fortyune v. City of Lomita, 766 F.3d 1098, 1100 (9th Cir. 2014) (“In this case, we must decide\nwhether Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (‘ADA’) requires local governments to\nprovide accessible on-street parking in the absence of regulatory design specifications for on-street\nparking facilities. We hold that it does.”); Cohen, 754 F.3d at 695 (“A city sidewalk is [] a ‘service,\nprogram, or activity’ of a public entity within the meaning of Title II.”); Frame v. City of Arlington,\n657 F.3d 215, 223 (5th Cir. 2011) (en banc) (“Based on statutory text and structure, we hold that\nTitle II and § 504 unambiguously extend to newly built and altered public sidewalks. We further\nhold that the plaintiffs have a private right of action to enforce Title II and § 504 to the extent they\nwould require the City to make reasonable modifications to such sidewalks.”); Barden v. City of\nSacramento, 292 F.3d 1073, 1076 (9th Cir. 2002) (“[M]aintaining public sidewalks is a normal\n-17-\n\nfunction of a city and without a doubt something that the City ‘does.’  Maintaining their accessibility\nfor individuals with disabilities therefore falls within the scope of Title II.” (quotations and citations\nomitted)).\nAny sensible reading of ADA Title II compels the conclusion that maintaining public\npedestrian thoroughfares for citizens to get around a city — and access the many public services and\nbusinesses located within — is the archetypal example of the most fundamental of public services. \nInaccessible sidewalks are, in fact, the single most readily conceivable example of a basic obstacle\nto accessibility that comes to mind when considering the purpose that animates the ADA, which is\nto eliminate obstacles to the full enjoyment of public life by disabled citizens.  See PGA Tour, Inc.\nv. Martin, 532 U.S. 661, 675 (2001) (“To effectuate its sweeping purpose, the ADA forbids\ndiscrimination against disabled individuals in major areas of public life . . . .”).  It is simply common\nsense: If disabled pedestrians cannot access the sidewalks, then they can hardly access anything else\nthat a city has to offer.\nFourth, even under the defendants’ crabbed reading of the rule of Babcock, the allegations\nhere are sufficient to state a claim that the “facility” defects alleged have obstructed the plaintiffs’\naccess to public “services.”  Leaving aside the question whether providing and maintaining\npedestrian thoroughfares in the form of public sidewalks is itself a public “service” — though it\ncertainly is under any reasonable construction of that term — the plaintiffs here plainly have alleged\nthat the sidewalk and parking area defects of which they complain have prevented them from\naccessing numerous public services such as public parking lots and spaces, City-sponsored parades\nand festivals, and even the public library.  The Babcock case plainly does not say what the State and\n-18-\n\nCounty think it says.  But even if it did, the allegations here are sufficient to pass muster under any\nreasonable reading of that decision.\nB.\nThe State and County defendants also believe that their “roadway” construction projects —\nwhether or not they also may involve constructing or altering sidewalks — are immune from\nscrutiny under the ADA because, even if they incorporate obvious accessibility obstacles, those\ndefendants are not liable for any resulting denial of access to public “services,” because any such\nservices are not provided by them, but instead are provided by the City of Chelsea.  But the ADA\nmakes no such distinction between the entity responsible for causing an obstruction and the\n(possibly separate) entity that provides a service that is obstructed by accessibility defects.  “Section\n35.151 is part of a broader regulatory scheme that aims to effectuate § 202 of the ADA,” Ability\nCenter, 385 F.3d at 904, and that “scheme makes explicit that ‘no qualified individual with a\ndisability shall, because a public entity’s facilities are inaccessible to or unusable by individuals\nwith disabilities, be excluded from participation in, or be denied the benefits of the services,\nprograms, or activities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any public entity,’”\nibid. (quoting 28 C.F.R. § 35.149).  \nThe regulations plainly state that no disabled person shall be denied the benefits of the\n“services of . . . a public entity” because “a public entity’s facilities are inaccessible.”  Nowhere does\nthe statute state that “a public entity” must be the same entity that both provides a service and creates\nor maintains the inaccessible facility that obstructs access to it.  Nor can any such restriction sensibly\nbe read into the law, since it is apparent that in many cases the agencies that construct and maintain\ngovernment facilities and those that operate within or among those facilities will be entirely distinct. \n-19-\n\nIf mere bureaucratic segregation between individual government agencies that build and maintain\nfacilities and those that operate within them is all that is required to escape the mandate of the ADA,\nthen the result would be that many — perhaps most — public facilities actually in existence today\nwould be entirely exempt from the Act’s accessibility mandate.  Such a tortured reading of Title II\nof the ADA would lead to an unwarranted — and absurd — result.  \nBecause the plaintiffs (and third-party plaintiff) have pleaded all the necessary elements of\ntheir claims under Title II of the ADA, the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and the PWDCRA, the Court\nwill deny the motions for judgment on the pleadings.   \nIII.\nThe plaintiffs also have moved for leave to file a second amended complaint to add the\nWCRC as a direct defendant.  Such motions are treated with liberality, Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(2), but\nthey may be denied upon a showing of “undue delay, bad faith by the moving party, repeated failure\nto cure defects by previously-allowed amendments, futility of the proposed new claim, or undue\nprejudice to the opposite party.”  Foman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178, 182 (1962); Duggins v. Steak ‘N\nShake, Inc., 195 F.3d 828, 834 (6th Cir. 1999).  Both the MDOT and the WCRC oppose the motion\non futility grounds, citing the arguments discussed and rejected above.  But the WCRC also contends\nthat the motion should be denied because of the plaintiffs’ undue delay, asserting that the plaintiffs\nknew for months that it was a potential defendant, but they did not seek leave to file an amended\ncomplaint until November 2016, more than three months after the third-party complaint was filed. \nThat argument is not persuasive.  Delay alone does not justify denial of a motion brought\nunder Rule 15(a).  Security Ins. Co. of Hartford v. Kevin Tucker & Assocs., Inc., 64 F.3d 1001, 1009\n(6th Cir. 1995).  Nor does the Rule establish a deadline within which a party must file a motion to\n-20-\n\namend. See Lloyd v. United Liquors Corp., 203 F.2d 789, 793-94 (6th Cir. 1953) (reviewing a\ndistrict court’s denial of a motion to amend after the entry of summary judgment). Of course, the\nparty seeking to amend must “act with due diligence if it wants to take advantage of the Rule’s\nliberality.”  Parry v. Mohawk Motors of Michigan, Inc., 236 F.3d 299, 306 (6th Cir. 2000) (internal\nquotation marks omitted).  But a party opposing an amendment based on delay must make “some\nsignificant showing of prejudice to the opponent.”  Moore v. City of Paducah, 790 F.2d 557, 562\n(6th Cir. 1986).  An amendment to a complaint prejudices a party where the amendment will require\nthat party to prepare an additional defense strategy and expend additional resources to defend against\nnew claims.  See Troxel Mfg. Co. v. Schwinn Bicycle Co., 489 F.2d 968, 971 (6th Cir. 1973). \nThere was no substantial delay in moving for the amendment.  The plaintiffs assert that they\ndid not know when the original complaint was filed that it was the County and not the City that was\nprimarily responsible for and in control of Old U.S. 12 within the city limits, and after they learned\nthat fact as a result of the City’s third-party complaint, some of the ensuing time was consumed by\nefforts to negotiate a settlement with all of the defendants, and some discussions about whether the\nCounty would or would not concur in a motion to amend.  The County does not dispute those\nassertions.  \nThe WCRC has made no credible showing of prejudice.  It has been a party to the action\nsince the third-party complaint was filed by the City.  In its motion to dismiss the third-party\ncomplaint, the WCRC directly challenged the substantive allegations of the primary complaint,\ncontending that it fails to state any claim on which relief can be granted against any of the\ndefendants.  And the WCRC essentially has responded to and participated in the litigation as a\nprimary defendant since it was joined by the third-party complaint, including, as the plaintiffs\n-21-\n\ncontend without dispute, by serving extensive discovery requests on the plaintiffs on November 11,\n2016.  The WCRC has not suggested any way in which it would be substantially prejudiced by a\nmere realignment of parties in the caption.  \nFinally, no purpose would be served by requiring the plaintiffs to file a separate action\nagainst the County in order to proceed against it directly.  Moreover, although the County takes\nsome issue with the exact scope of its authority, it does not deny that it has at least some substantial\npart of the responsibility for and control over the Old U.S. 12 right-of-way that runs through the\nCity, and it does not deny that it has engaged in at least some construction and maintenance of that\nroadway during the time frame relevant to the complaint.  \nIt is true that under the Court’s scheduling order, discovery has closed and summary\njudgment motions are due.  However, the parties have suggested and the Court is willing to entertain\nan adjustment to the deadlines to address any disadvantage that may have resulted from the timing\nof the present decision.  The WCRC is free to present a proposal to amend the current schedule to\nalleviate any marginal prejudice that the realignment of the parties might cause.  \nIV.\nThe parties — or some of them — evidently engaged in settlement negotiations, and the\nplaintiffs and the City of Chelsea were able to reach a compromise that they ask the Court to embody\nin the form of a consent decree.  The WCRC opposes the request on the grounds that it believes the\nclaims in the amended complaint are without merit, the proposed settlement agreement is ambiguous\nand indefinite in scope, and entry of the consent decree may impair its ability to defend against the\nclaims raised in the third-party complaint and proposed second amended complaint.  \n-22-\n\nThe plaintiffs assert that the decree does not purport to bind either the State or the County,\nand it does not resolve any claims other than those against the City itself.  The plaintiffs point out\nthat the decree contemplates that the parties to it will engage in discussions with the County and\nState before implementing or attempting to implement any measures that compliance with it may\nrequire.  But if those entities remain uncooperative, the plaintiffs fully are prepared to proceed with\nthe litigation against them concerning the roadway areas that are under their exclusive purview, and\nover which the City has no control.  \n“‘A consent decree is essentially a settlement agreement subject to continued judicial\npolicing.’”  Pedreira v. Sunrise Children’s Servs., Inc., 802 F.3d 865, 871 (6th Cir. 2015) (quoting\nWilliams v. Vukovich, 720 F.2d 909, 920 (6th Cir. 1983)).  “Consent decrees typically have two key\nattributes that make them different from private settlements.  First, when a court enters a consent\ndecree, it retains jurisdiction to enforce the decree.  In contrast, the parties to a private settlement\ntypically must bring another suit (for breach of contract) to enforce it.  Second, a consent decree puts\n‘the power and prestige of the court behind the compromise struck by the parties.’”  Ibid. (quoting\nWilliams, 720 F.2d at 920).  “The same is not true of a dismissal order that does not incorporate the\nparties’ terms.”  Ibid.  “[C]onsent decrees are a prospective form of relief involving continuous court\noversight.  They are designed to be a flexible remedy, easily modifiable when the facts or law as to\nthe parties change.”  Whitlock v. FSL Mgmt., LLC, 843 F.3d 1084, 1094 (6th Cir. 2016).  \nThe force of a consent decree comes from “the parties’ acquiescence, not rules of law.”  City\nof Warren v. City of Detroit, 495 F.3d 282, 287 (6th Cir. 2007) (citing Local No. 93, Int’l Ass’n of\nFirefighters v. City of Cleveland, 478 U.S. 501, 522 (1986)).  Therefore, only the parties who agree\ncan be bound by it.  Such a decree “‘may not dispose of the claims of a third party, and a fortiori\n-23-\n\nmay not impose duties or obligations on a third party, without that party’s agreement.’”  Ibid.\n(quoting Firefighters, 478 U.S. at 529).  \nThese rules protect the WCRC from any adverse impact on it of the consent decree.  The\nproposed consent decree binds only the parties to it, which are explicitly named to be the individual\nplaintiffs and the City itself.  The decree even states that it does not purport to bind the other\ndefendants.  The parties to the decree apparently regard it as sufficiently specific for their purposes,\nand the County’s concerns in that respect are immaterial since the decree imposes no duty of\nperformance on any entity other than the City.  The County vaguely alludes to fears that the\ncompromise of the plaintiffs’ claims as to the City may impair its ability to defend the claims against\nitself in this case, but it has not offered any factual or legal basis for that concern.  None of the\nCounty’s defenses to the claims against it, either as a third-party or a primary defendant, are or could\nbe impaired or foreclosed by entry of a consent decree that binds only the plaintiffs and a separate\npublic entity, where the County has not itself consented to entry of the decree.  Warren, 495 F.3d\nat 286 (“At the outset, it is important to note that Warren is not a party to any of the consent\njudgments, is not bound by the judgments, and is entitled to its ‘own day in court’ to challenge\nactions taken under the judgments.” (quoting Martin v. Wilks, 490 U.S. 755, 761-62 (1989))); United\nStates v. City of Miami, 614 F.2d 1322, 1329 (5th Cir. 1980) (“Unless the [defendant] can\ndemonstrate that it has been ordered to take some action by the decree, or ordered not to take some\naction, or that its rights or legitimate interests have otherwise been affected, it has no right to prevent\nthe other parties and the Court from signing the decree.”).\nThe cases that the County relies upon for the proposition that the Court must hold a hearing\nand approve a consent decree only after finding that it meets certain criteria of fairness of\n-24-\n\nreasonableness are inapposite, because they involved compromises of specific types of claims such\nas labor disputes or class actions, where extra attention by the Court is mandated by the applicable\nstatutes or case law, or where the decree necessarily must foreclose the rights of absent parties.  See\nCity of Miami, 614 F.2d at 1330 (noting that only in “certain special situations [is] the trial court . . .\nrequired by statute or rule to approve a settlement to which the parties to the litigation have agreed,”\nwhich include “proposed class action settlements, proposed shareholder derivative suit settlements,\nand proposed compromises of claims in bankruptcy court”) (citations omitted).  Otherwise, “an\nactive role for the trial court in approving the adequacy of a settlement is the exceptional situation,\nnot the general rule.”  Id. at 1331.  No such unusual claims or concerns are present in this case,\nwhich does not involve any of the circumstances that typically would prompt close judicial scrutiny\nof a proposed settlement.\nFinally, any concern of the parties (or the Court) as to the indefinite term of judicial\nsupervision under the decree readily may be remedied by inclusion of an appropriate sunset date in\nthe final version of the decree entered by the Court, or by a later motion to modify or terminate the\ndecree.  \nV.\nThe plaintiffs have stated valid claims in their first amended complaint under Title II of the\nADA, the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and the PWDCRA.  There is no good reason why the plaintiffs\nshould not be able to amend their complaint once again to plead their claims directly against the\nWCRC.  Likewise, there is no valid reason for refusing the proposed consent decree between the\nplaintiffs and defendant City of Chelsea.   \n-25-\n\nAccordingly, it is ORDERED that the motions for judgment on the pleadings [dkt. #26, 30]\nare DENIED.  \nIt is further ORDERED that the plaintiffs’ motion for leave to file a second amended\ncomplaint [dkt. #34, 36] is GRANTED.

Recently, the United States celebrated the twenty-fifth anniversary \nof the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). According to Congress, fully \naccessible sidewalks, street level transit stops, and pedestrian crossings are \nthe ADA’s corner-stone:  \n  1 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-11546-DML-EAS   ECF No. 65, PageID.1728   Filed 05/22/17   Page 2 of 37\nThe  employment,  transportation,  and  public  accommodation \nsections  of  this  [Americans  with  Disabilities]  Act  would  be \nmeaningless if people who use wheelchairs were not afforded \nthe opportunity to travel on and between the streets. \n \nH.R. Rep. No. 101-485, pt. 2, at 84 (1990), reprinted in 1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. \n303, 367.  \n  2. In Chelsea, people with mobility impairments, who use wheelchairs \nor other adaptive aid, find that Chelsea’s streets and walks are not readily \naccessible  to  and  usable  by  them.  And  while  Chelsea  is  in  some  ways  \nbecoming more accessible, in other, critical ways, Chelsea is regressing in \naccessibility, by permitting downtown businesses to renovate while creating \nnew steps and other barriers to access, and by Chelsea itself removing long \nexisting curb ramps and replacing them with grass and new, solid curbs, \namong other practices, detailed below. \n  3.  This  lawsuit  concerns  only  services,  programs,  activities  and \nfacilities located within the borders of the City of Chelsea. Plaintiffs bring \nthis lawsuit to make defendants’ facilities, services, programs and activities \naccessible according to law.  \n    4. More than a decade ago, when interpreting the ADA, the federal \nSixth Circuit Court of Appeals found:  \n  “[F]ailing to provide curb cuts and other accommodations in \nthe course of altering city streets and sidewalks in violation \nof  [28  C.F.R.  ]  §  35.151  denies  the  disabled  meaningful \n  2 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-11546-DML-EAS   ECF No. 65, PageID.1729   Filed 05/22/17   Page 3 of 37\naccess  to  public  services  by  perpetuating  architectural \nbarriers that impede such access…”.  \n \nAbility Center of Greater Toledo v City of Sandusky, Ohio, 385 F.3d 901, \n913-914  (6th  Cir.  2004).  However,  ten  years  later,  the  majority  of \nintersections in  Chelsea  lack  one  or  more  required  ADA-compliant  curb \ncuts. Making things worse with each new resurfacing project, defendants are \nremoving existing curb cuts and replacing them with new solid curbs. And, \nthe sidewalks and street level transit stops in between these missing curb \ncuts have many barriers making sidewalks dangerous for pedestrians with \ndisabilities. \n  5. Individual Plaintiffs Shauna M. Mote, Deborah Clark, Carlos Gray-\nLion, Brenda Baraniak, Karen Street, Merlyn Street, Jennifer Kundak, Lee \nBenton, through Next Friends, Ronald M. Benton and Marion Benton, and \nJ.N., a minor, through next friends Daniel and Mary Jane Nelson, bring this \nlawsuit  to  make  Chelsea  accessible  according  to  law.  Each  of  these \nindividuals  lives,  works,  or  frequently  travels  for  business  or  pleasure \nthroughout Chelsea Michigan. Each is a person with a mobility disability \nand has been personally discriminated against and subjected to hazardous \nconditions due to the access barriers at issue in this case. Each would benefit \nby the removal of these barriers. \n  3 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-11546-DML-EAS   ECF No. 65, PageID.1730   Filed 05/22/17   Page 4 of 37\n  6. The Ann Arbor Center for Independent Living, (AACIL) represents \npersons with disabilities throughout southeast Michigan, including Chelsea, \nwho have been or will be discriminated against and subjected to hazardous \nconditions due to the access barriers at issue in this case. Previously, AACIL \nsuccessfully brought similar lawsuits against the Michigan cities Monroe (in \n2002), Ann Arbor (in 2004), and Ypsilanti (in 2005).  \n  7. The Defendants are the City of Chelsea, the Chelsea Downtown \nDevelopment  Authority,  (“DDA”)  the  Michigan  Department  of \nTransportation, (“MDOT”), and the Washtenaw County Road Commission, \n(“WCRC”). \n  8.  Defendants—through  defective  construction  and  alterations, \ncombined  with  insufficient  maintenance  and  enforcement—have \ncontinuously failed to ensure that their sidewalks, street crossings, street \nlevel  transit  stops,  and  certain  other  facilities,  services,  programs  and \nactivities are readily usable by and accessible to Plaintiffs and others. \n           II.   JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n9. This is an action for declaratory and final injunctive relief, brought \npursuant  to  the  Americans  with  Disabilities  Act  (“ADA”),  42  U.S.C.  § \n12101 to 12213, specifically Title II of the ADA, and Section 504 of the \n  4 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-11546-DML-EAS   ECF No. 65, PageID.1731   Filed 05/22/17   Page 5 of 37\nRehabilitation  Act  of  1973,  29  U.S.C.  §  794  et  seq.,  and  Michigan’s \nPWDCRA.   \n9.A. This Court has jurisdiction over this action under 28 U.S.C. §§ \n1331 and 1343 for claims arising under the ADA and Section 504 of the \nRehabilitation Act. \n9.B.  This  Court  has  jurisdiction  to  issue  a  declaratory  judgment \npursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 and 2202. \n  9.C.  Venue  is  proper  under  28  U.S.C.  §  1391(b)  because  each \ndefendant  is located in the Eastern District and the events and/or omissions \ngiving  rise  to  Plaintiffs’  claims  occurred  inside  the  City  of  Chelsea, \nMichigan, in this District. \n  9.D. Jurisdiction in Count III is based on this Court's supplemental \njurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1367, because the Michigan State law \nclaims arise out a common nucleus of facts with the federal law claims. In \naddition, the ADA and PWDCRA \"substantially mirror\" each other. Donald \nv. Sybra, Inc., 667 F.3d 757, 764 (6th Cir. 2012). Therefore, \"claims under \nboth statutes are generally analyzed identically.\" Steward v. New Chrysler, \n415 Fed. Appx. 632, 641 (6th Cir.2011). \n \n \n  5 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-11546-DML-EAS   ECF No. 65, PageID.1732   Filed 05/22/17   Page 6 of 37\nIII.   PARTIES \n  10.  Individual  Plaintiffs  Shauna  M.  Mote,  Deborah  Clark,  Carlos \nGray-Lion, Brenda Baraniak, Karen Street, Merlyn Street, Jennifer Kundak, \nLee Benton, through Next Friends, Ronald M. Benton and Marion Benton, \nand J.N., a minor, through next friends Daniel and Mary Jane Nelson, each \nlives,  works,  or  frequently  travels  for  business  or  pleasure  throughout \nChelsea, Michigan.  \n  11. Each individual Plaintiff has a mobility impairment, and must rely \nupon a wheelchair, braces, crutches, canes or other adaptive aids to move \nabout Chelsea. Each named individual Plaintiff is a \"qualified person with a \ndisability\" as defined by the Americans With Disabilities Act, and also under \nthe Rehabilitation Act. \n  12. The Ann Arbor Center for Independent Living, Inc., (AACIL), \noperating throughout Washtenaw County, Michigan, in including in the City \nof  Chelsea,  is  a  nonprofit  Michigan  Corporation,  and  has  employees, \nvolunteers, clients and customers such as Deborah Clark and Shauna Mote, \nwho live, work or travel throughout the City of Chelsea, and could bring this \nlawsuit on their own. AACIL’s Board of Trustees and staff, composed of a \nmajority  of  people  with  disabilities,  was  created  to  assure  equality  of \nopportunity,  full  participation,  independent  living  and  economic  self-\n  6 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-11546-DML-EAS   ECF No. 65, PageID.1733   Filed 05/22/17   Page 7 of 37\nsufficiency  of  people  with  disabilities  by  working  to  eliminate  the \nattitudinal,  environmental,  architectural  and  communication  barriers  that \nperpetuate acts of discrimination toward people with disabilities, including \nsight  impairment  and  mobility  impairments.  The  AACIL  has  been \nadvocating for and assisting people with disabilities in Southeast Michigan \nsince  1976.  The  AACIL  has  suffered  financial  harm  and  has  diverted \nresources due to defendants’ discrimination, and it has members, clients and \nconsumers who are suffering from Defendants’ discrimination. Defendants’ \ndiscrimination frustrates the mission of AACIL and has caused it financial \nharm and has forced it to divert funds and resources. \n  13.  Each  Plaintiff  is  being  denied  access  to  Defendants’  facilities, \nprograms,  services  or  activities.  Each  Plaintiff  continues  to  suffer  from \nDefendants’ failure to make streets, roads and highways, sidewalks or other \nstreet  level  pedestrian  walkways  readily  accessible  to  and  usable  by \nPlaintiffs, and will benefit from the relief sought here.  \n  14.  Defendants  the  City  of  Chelsea,  (“Chelsea”)  the  Chelsea \nDowntown Development Authority (“DDA”), the Michigan Department of \nTransportation  (MDOT),  and  the  Washtenaw  County  Road  Commission \n(“WCRC”) are each public entities as that term is defined under 42 U.S.C. § \n12131(l); 28 C.F.R. § 35.104.  \n  7 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-11546-DML-EAS   ECF No. 65, PageID.1734   Filed 05/22/17   Page 8 of 37\n  15. Defendants are discriminating against Plaintiffs by denying access \nto facilities, programs, services and activities located within Chelsea. \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n16. Pursuant to Rule 23(b)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, \nthe Named Plaintiffs bring this action, for final injunctive and declaratory \nrelief  purposes  only,  on  their  own  behalf  and  on  behalf  of  all  persons \nsimilarly situated. The Named Plaintiffs seek to represent a class composed \nof all persons with mobility and/or vision disabilities who use and/or will in \nthe future use Defendants’ facilities, services, programs or activities within \nthe City of Chelsea, Michigan, The claims asserted herein are solely for final \ninjunctive  and  declaratory  relief  for  the  class;  damage  claims  are  not \nincluded in this complaint. \nA. The persons in the class are so numerous that joinder of all such \npersons is impracticable and the disposition of their claims in a class action \nis a benefit to the parties and to the Court. \nB. There is a well-defined community of interest in the questions of \nlaw and fact involved affecting the parties to be represented in that they, or \ntheir members, are all being denied, or will be denied, their civil rights of \naccess to Defendants’ facilities, services, programs or activities due to the \nbarriers described herein. \n  8 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-11546-DML-EAS   ECF No. 65, PageID.1735   Filed 05/22/17   Page 9 of 37\nC.  Common  questions  of  law  and  fact  predominate,  including \nquestions  raised  by  Plaintiffs’  allegations  that  Defendants  have  failed  to \nprovide  program  access  to  Defendants’  facilities,  or  have  constructed  or \naltered facilities without making the altered portions accessible according to \nlaw. \nD. The named Plaintiffs are adequate class representatives because \nthey,  or  their  members,  are  directly  impacted  by  Defendants’  failure  to \nprovide program access to Defendants’ facilities. The interests of the named \nPlaintiffs are not antagonistic to, or in conflict with, the interests of the class \nas  a  whole.  The  attorneys  representing  the  class  are  experienced  in \nrepresenting clients in class action civil rights claims. \nF. Claims of the named Plaintiffs are typical of the claims of the class \nas a whole because the Named Plaintiffs, or their members, are similarly \naffected by Defendants’ failure to provide access to Defendants’ facilities, \nservices, program or activities. \nG. Defendants have acted and/or failed to act on grounds generally \napplicable to the class as a whole, thereby making appropriate declaratory \nand final injunctive relief with respect to the class as a whole. \nH. References to Plaintiffs shall be deemed to include each named \nplaintiff and each member of the class, unless otherwise indicated. \n  9 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-11546-DML-EAS   ECF No. 65, PageID.1736   Filed 05/22/17   Page 10 of 37\nExamples of Individuals Plaintiffs \n  17. Plaintiff Deborah Clark recently moved to the Chelsea area. She \nuses a wheelchair and has a service dog. Within the last three years, she first \ncame to Chelsea and began to discover that she could not safely access \nChelsea’s  sidewalks,  street  crossings,  and  municipal  parking.  Also,  she \nfound  that  many  of  Chelsea’s  downtown  businesses  lack  an  accessible \nentrance.  Thus,  Plaintiff  Clark  is  segregated  from  almost  every  facility, \nservice, program or activity, including on-street parking, the parades, the \nfestivals,  and  the  library  in  Chelsea.  She  risks  her  safety  each  time  she \nattempts to use sidewalks, street crossings and municipal parking in Chelsea. \nShe constantly encounters barriers to access each time she comes to town. \n  18. Plaintiffs Shauna Mote recently tried to use the new Jackson Street \nparking lot and the driveway and new walkways connecting to the parking \nlot to Middle Street. Although the DDA built these in 2014, they are not \nreadily  accessible  to  and  usable  by  Plaintiff  Mote,  because  they  are  too \nsteep.  \n  19. Plaintiff Carlos Gray-Lion lives very close to Congdon Street. \nDuring late 2015, Chelsea altered that stretch of Congdon and the sidewalks \nadjacent. But Chelsea removed a long existing curb cut, and replaced it with \n  10 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-11546-DML-EAS   ECF No. 65, PageID.1737   Filed 05/22/17   Page 11 of 37\ngrass and a new curb, and stopped the project just short of a crosswalk, \nleaving an old, inaccessible curb cut on one side, and steps on the other. \n  20.  Plaintiffs  Karen  and  Merlyn  Street  have  recently  learned  that \nChelsea removed long existing curb ramps in the Wilkinson Street area, and \nreplaced them with grass and solid curbs \n  21. Annually, Defendants Chelsea and Chelsea DDA sponsor and host \nseveral festivals and two parades. Each Plaintiff has had to miss some of \nthese  events  due  to  the  lack  of  accessible  municipal  parking,  accessible \nsidewalks  and  street  crossings,  and  other  access  barriers  at  the  various \nvenues. These programs, services or activities are not readily accessible to \nand usable by Plaintiffs due in part to the lack of ADA complaint municipal \nparking, sidewalks and street crossings, including, but not limited to, along \nSR 52—Main Street. \n  22. Each Plaintiff suffers from this lack of access, as do similarly \nsituated persons with disabilities who visit Chelsea to use these facilities, or \nto participate in these programs, activities or services, or merely to visit \nfriends and shop. This is not an exhaustive, list, it is merely to illustrate the \nlack of access Plaintiffs seek to correct. \n \n \n  11 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-11546-DML-EAS   ECF No. 65, PageID.1738   Filed 05/22/17   Page 12 of 37\nEXAMPLES OF BARRIERS TO ACCESS \nMichigan State Route 52, Main Street, Chelsea \n  23. Throughout this Complaint, references to “Michigan State Route \n52”, “SR 52” and “Main Street” refer only to those portions that exist inside \nthe physical borders of the City of Chelsea, Michigan. \n  24.  State  Route  52  runs  uninterrupted  from  the  north  border  of \nChelsea through the south border of Chelsea. This stretch is a state trunk line \nhighway. \n  25. MDOT is responsible for the maintenance of this stretch of SR 52.  \n  26. MDOT has resurfaced this entire stretch of SR 52 from edge line \nto edge line after January 26, 1992. Some portions of the stretch have curbs. \nOn these segments, MDOT has resurfaced from curb line to curb line after \nJanuary 26, 1992. \n  27. After January 26, 1992, MDOT resurfaced this stretch of SR 52 \ninside Chelsea, but left in place one or more curbs or other barriers to an \nintersecting street level pedestrian walkway.  \n  28. After January 26, 1992, along this stretch MDOT constructed or \naltered one or more sidewalks or other street level pedestrian walkways, but \nleft in place one or more curb or other barrier to its intersection with SR 52.  \n  12 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-11546-DML-EAS   ECF No. 65, PageID.1739   Filed 05/22/17   Page 13 of 37\n  29. After January 26, 1992, MDOT has constructed or altered one or \nmore curb ramps or other sloped areas connecting street level pedestrian \nwalkways with SR 52 inside Chelsea. The same is true for one or more curb \nramps or other sloped areas where the sidewalks running parallel to SR 52 \ncross streets, roads or highways intersecting with SR 52. \n  30. After January 26, 1992, MDOT has granted permission to Chelsea \nto construct or alter one or more curb ramps or other sloped areas connecting \nstreet level pedestrian walkways with SR 52. The same is true for one or \nmore curb ramps or other sloped areas where the sidewalks running parallel \nto SR 52 cross streets, roads or highways intersecting with SR 52. \n  31.  After  January  26,  1992,  Chelsea  has  resurfaced  or  otherwise \naltered one or more streets intersecting with SR 52.  \n  32. Chelsea exerts jurisdiction over all sidewalks within its borders. \nChelsea’s sidewalk ordinance admits that the regulated creation and timely \nupkeep of its system of sidewalks is necessary to the successful delivery of \npublic safety services. For example, Chelsea regulates the types of items and \ndisplays individuals can place on sidewalks, mandates the removal of snow \nand  ice  from  sidewalks,  reserves  the  right  to  do  so  itself,  charging  and \ncollecting from adjacent owners for doing so. Chelsea also makes it a crime \nto obstruct sidewalks. Chelsea also demands that those who wish to occupy \n  13 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-11546-DML-EAS   ECF No. 65, PageID.1740   Filed 05/22/17   Page 14 of 37\nor otherwise hold events on public sidewalks to obtain a permit from the \ngovernment. This also includes the sidewalks running parallel to SR 52. \n  33. Some of the intersections along this stretch have bump-outs. Some \nof these have been constructed or altered after January 26, 1992. MDOT \nconstructed or altered some of these bump outs. MDOT granted Chelsea \npermission to construct or alter one or more of these bump outs. \n  34. There are sidewalks running parallel to both sides of SR 52 from \nits intersection with Commerce Park Drive on the south side of Chelsea \nthrough  to  just  south  of  its  intersection  with  Sibley  Road.  A  sidewalk \ncontinues running parallel to SR 52 on its east side to Hickory Drive on \nChelsea’s north end.   \n  35.  Within  the  last  three  years,  Chelsea  installed  some  pedestrian \ncross walks crossing SR 52. MDOT approved the plans for these. \n  36. When Chelsea closes SR 52 for a parade or a festival, it obtains a \npermit or other permission from MDOT prior to the closing. \n  37. MDOT is aware that there is on-street parking existing along some \nportions of SR 52 inside the City of Chelsea. MDOT has granted permission \nfor this parking. MDOT has striped these parking spaces. MDOT granted \nChelsea permission to stripe these parking spaces. After January 26, 1992, \n  14 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-11546-DML-EAS   ECF No. 65, PageID.1741   Filed 05/22/17   Page 15 of 37\nMDOT has resurfaced the asphalt upon which these on street parking spaces \ncurrently sit. \n  38.None of the on-street parking along SR 52 inside Chelsea is, to the \nmaximum extent feasible, readily accessible to and usable by Plaintiffs. \n  39. The majority of curb ramps crossing SR 52 suffer from one or \nmore of the following conditions: a running slope exceeding 8.33%, a cross \nslope exceeding 1:48, a top landing with slopes exceeding 1:48, changes in \nlevel exceeding ¼ inch, lips at transitions to street crossings, counter slopes \nexceeding 5%, holes or defects in the crosswalk or where the crosswalk \nmeets the curb ramp. The same is true of the curb ramps on the sidewalks \nrunning parallel to SR 52.  \n  40. In sum, the sidewalks, curb cuts and pedestrian crossings running \nparallel to and also crossing SR 52 have been constructed, resurfaced or \notherwise altered after January 26, 1992, and are not, to the maximum extent \nfeasible,  accessible  to  and  usable  by  Plaintiffs.  They  are  barriers  to \nPlaintiffs’ access. \nOther Streets and Roads inside Chelsea \n  41. During year 2015, Chelsea resurfaced Congdon Street from its \nintersection with Lincoln Street to just short of its intersection with Middle \nStreet. As a part of this project, Chelsea removed a long existing curb ramp \n  15 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-11546-DML-EAS   ECF No. 65, PageID.1742   Filed 05/22/17   Page 16 of 37\ncrossing Lincoln Avenue, planted grass in its place, and built new solid \ncurbs  at  the  NW  and  NE  corners  of  the  intersection  of  Congdon  with \nLincoln.  This  alteration  created  a  lesser  level  of  accessibility  at  that \npedestrian crossing. Chelsea should never replace existing curb ramps with \ngrass and a new curb. Instead of building new curbs, Chelsea should have \ninstalled  curb  cuts  at  both  ends  of  those  pedestrian  crossings. \nhttp://www.ada.gov/dojfhwatasupplement2015.html , Q and A ## 3, 11 and \n12. In addition, Chelsea resurfaced Congdon curb to curb for the entire two \nblock  span,  but  stopped  just  short  of  the  pedestrian  crossing  of  Condon \nwhere  it  intersects  with  Middle  street,  leaving  that  pedestrian  crossing \ncompletely inaccessible. Upon information and belief, Chelsea did this to \navoid its obligation to install these two new curb cuts. Id., at # 3. \n  42.  During  2014,  Chelsea  and/or  the  DDA  completed  its  Jackson \nStreet Parking Lot project which included constructing a street from the \nparking connecting to Middle Street. These facilities violate the ADAAG \nstandards, are too steep, and are not readily accessible to and usable by \nPlaintiffs.  \n  43. Going back to January 26, 1992, Chelsea and or its DDA has \nresurfaced or altered many streets and roads, but left in place curbs or other \nbarriers to street level pedestrian walkways. Throughout the City, Plaintiffs \n  16 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-11546-DML-EAS   ECF No. 65, PageID.1743   Filed 05/22/17   Page 17 of 37\ncannot travel for more than a block or two without encountering non-ADA \ncompliant slopes and changes in level, and other barriers to access. \n  44. Upon information and belief, going back to January 26, 1992, \nChelsea and or its DDA has resurfaced or altered many streets and roads, \nand has built curb ramps or other sloped areas that suffer from one or more \nof the following conditions: a running slope exceeding 8.33%, a cross slope \nexceeding 1:48, a top landing with slopes exceeding 1:48, changes in level \nexceeding  ¼  inch,  lips  at  transitions  to  street  crossings,  counter  slopes \nexceeding 5%, holes or defects in the crosswalk or where the crosswalk \nmeets the curb ramp. Many of these curb ramps constitute tipping hazards. \nSidewalks and other Street Level Pedestrian Walkways inside Chelsea \n  45.  During  year  2015,  MDOT  awarded  Chelsea  a  Safe  Route  to \nSchools Grant. (“SR2S”). This was comprised of federal funds. Chelsea used \nthis grant to fill in sidewalk gaps and to upgrade ADA curb ramps along key \nschool  routes  within  the  City  limits.  The  scope  of  the  project  included, \namong  other  things,  filling  in  sidewalk  gaps  on  Wilkinson,  Wellington, \nChandler, Grant and West Old U.S. 12; installing a rapid flash, pedestrian \ncrossing on West Old U.S. 12 at Wilkinson Street, and upgrading ADA curb \nramps  and  signage  at  numerous  intersections  along  Pierce,  Madison, \nWashington, Freer, Elm, Howard and McKinley Streets. Chelsea City Staff \n  17 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-11546-DML-EAS   ECF No. 65, PageID.1744   Filed 05/22/17   Page 18 of 37\nconducted ongoing project inspections. As a part of this project, among other \nthings, at some intersections Chelsea removed long existing curb ramps and \nreplaced them with grass and built new solid curbs. At such places, the \nalteration resulted in a lesser level of accessibility. Chelsea altered street \nlevel pedestrian walkways but constructed new curbs and other barriers, or \nleft in place existing curbs or other barriers to an intersecting street, road or \nhighway. Also, at some intersections, Chelsea apparently limited the scope \nof the work to stop just before some pedestrian crossings, to avoid triggering \nnew, accessible curb ramps.  \n  46. Upon information and belief, going back to January 26, 1992, \nChelsea and or its DDA has resurfaced or altered other walks, sidewalks and \nother street level pedestrian walkways, but has left in place a curb or other \nbarrier to an intersection with a street , road or highway, or has built or left \nin place curb ramps or other sloped areas that suffer from one or more of the \nfollowing  conditions:  a  running  slope  exceeding  8.33%,  a  cross  slope \nexceeding 1:48, a top landing with slopes exceeding 1:48, changes in level \nexceeding  ¼  inch,  lips  at  transitions  to  street  crossings,  counter  slopes \nexceeding 5%, holes or defects in the crosswalk or where the crosswalk \nmeets the curb ramp. Many of these curb ramps constitute tipping hazards. \n \n  18 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-11546-DML-EAS   ECF No. 65, PageID.1745   Filed 05/22/17   Page 19 of 37\nChelsea’s Municipal Parking \n  47.  Throughout  Chelsea,  the  City  and/or  the  DDA  has  created, \nmaintains, regulates and operates a system of municipal parking lots and \nalso on-street parking.  \n  48. Chelsea has a system of municipal parking lots, designated by a \nletter, e.g, Parking Lot A, etc. Each of the municipal lots has one or more \ndesignated  spaces  for  persons  with  disabilities.  Each  of  these  has  been \nrestriped, resurfaced or otherwise altered after 1992. None of these are, to \nthe maximum extent feasible, readily accessible to and usable by Plaintiffs. \n28 C.F.R. 35.151(a) and (b). Each violates one or more of the measurements \nfor accessible parking spaces. For example see: www.ada.gov/restripe.pdf;  \nhttps://adata.org/factsheet/parking.  \n  49. In addition, Chelsea has created, maintains, regulates and operates \na system of municipal on-street parking. Chelsea has designated some of \nthese on street parking spaces as reserved for those with disabilities. Chelsea \nhas restriped, resurfaced or otherwise altered each of these spaces after 1992. \nAlmost all of these spaces have a surface slope exceeding 1:48. In addition, \nmany lack a clear space to deploy a ramp, and the surface to deploy the ramp \nsuffers from slopes exceeding 1:48, among other defects. As a result, these \ndesignated  on-street  parking  spaces  None  of  these  are,  to  the  maximum \n  19 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-11546-DML-EAS   ECF No. 65, PageID.1746   Filed 05/22/17   Page 20 of 37\nextent  feasible,  readily  accessible  to  and  usable  by  Plaintiffs.  28  C.F.R. \n35.151(a) and (b). \n  50. The City the DDA and MDOT’s provision of on-street parking is \na  “service,  program  or  activity”  of  defendants.  See  Fortyune  v  City  of \nLomita, 766 F.3d 1098, 1102-03 (9th Cir. 2014). When viewed in its entirety, \nit is not readily accessible to and usable by Plaintiffs. \n  51.  When  the  City  and  its  DDA  advertise  the  Sights  and  Sounds \nFestival, they provide a map of the municipal parking and claim that it is \nADA  accessible.  But  municipal  parking  is  not  readily  accessible  to  and \nusable by Plaintiffs. \n  51.A. Snow and ice make each of these barriers worse. At times, each \nPlaintiff has had to avoid downtown Chelsea for extended periods due to \nsnow and ice. \nDefendant Chelsea and DDA’s Festivals and Parades \n  52. Along with its other services, program and activities, Defendant \nChelsea  also  sponsors  and  otherwise  hosts  several  public  festivals  and \nParades. Some of these are: \n  A. The Chelsea Community Fair. This occurs annually in late August, \nat the Chelsea Community Fairgrounds. The fair is not fully accessible. As a \npart of the Fair, Chelsea and the DDA sponsor and host a parade, which \n  20 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-11546-DML-EAS   ECF No. 65, PageID.1747   Filed 05/22/17   Page 21 of 37\nbegins near Middle Street in downtown Chelsea, and proceeds down SR 52 \n(Main Street) through Chelsea to the Fairgrounds. Plaintiff Deborah Clark \nwould like to participate in the parade, or at least watch it, but has not been \nable to do so due to the lack of accessible municipal parking, sidewalks, and \nstreet crossings, complained of above. Similarly, all Plaintiffs have been and \nwill continue to be hindered from the event due to lack of access. \n  B. The Sights and Sounds Festival. Chelsea and the DDA Sponsor and \nhost this three day event, which is scheduled this year for July 28-30, 2016. \nIt has eleven stages, and a social tent, a food court, many musical acts, and \nother artist. The majority of these are located on Chelsea municipal property, \nincluding some municipal parking lots and sidewalks, and are all either on \nSR 52 or within a block of it. Because the musical acts change each year, \neach Plaintiff has a new opportunity to miss an act or multiple acts that he or \nshe may wish to see, because it is not readily accessible to and usable. Due \nto the lack of accessible municipal parking and the inaccessible sidewalks \nthroughout  Chelsea,  this  service,  program  or  activity  is  inaccessible  to \nPlaintiffs.  \n  C.  Sights  and  Sounds  on  Thursday  Nights:  Chelsea  and  the  DDA \nSponsor  and  host  this  program,  service  or  activity  for  two  hours  each \nThursday night for approximately eleven weeks. It uses the same stages as \n  21 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-11546-DML-EAS   ECF No. 65, PageID.1748   Filed 05/22/17   Page 22 of 37\nthose for the Sights and Sounds Festival, and has all of the barriers to access \nas listed above. Because the musical acts change each Thursday night and \neach year, each Plaintiff has a new opportunity to miss an act he or she may \nwish to see, because it is not readily accessible to and usable. \n  D. The Hometown Holiday Festival: Chelsea and the DDA sponsor \nand host this service, program or activity, each December. Likewise, it is \nheld in downtown Chelsea, and the lack of accessible municipal parking and \naccessible sidewalks make it inaccessible to Plaintiffs. \n  E. Plaintiffs and all those similarly situated can only enter the Chelsea \nCommunity Fairgrounds by two entrances, both located on WCRC roads—\nOld  Manchester  Road  and  Old  U.S.  Highway  12.  At  the  Fair’s  Eastern \nentrance, crossing Old Manchester, there is a painted crosswalk with solid \ncurbs at both ends. This pedestrian crossing is inaccessible to Plaintiffs. \nF.  During  year  2007,  WCRC,  “in  cooperation  with”  MDOT, \nresurfaced Old U.S. Highway 12 from approximately its intersection with \nWilkinson Street through just west of its intersection with Main Street, (S.R. \n52). This included the “approaches” of each intersection along this stretch. \nFederal funds were used for this. \n  G. As a part of this resurfacing, WCRC installed two curb ramps \ncrossing Old 12 at Wilkinson. WCRC installed four curb ramps at each \n  22 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-11546-DML-EAS   ECF No. 65, PageID.1749   Filed 05/22/17   Page 23 of 37\nintersection of Old 12 with Lane, Arthur and Taylor Streets. WCRC installed \ntwo curb ramps crossing the entrance to the Mall. The Chelsea Community \nFair’s “handicapped” entrance located on this stretch of Old U.S. 12. The \ncurb ramps crossing Old 12 at Wilkinson, Lane and Arthur lack stop control. \nThe speed limit is 45 m.p.h. on Old 12. \n  H. Some of these curb ramps suffer from excessive running slopes. \nSome of these curb ramps suffer from excessive cross slopes. Most of these \ncurb ramps have abrupt changes at their transition to the streets. Most of \nthese curb ramps collect water during rain and snow. This water ponds on \nthe ramp surfaces. The moisture evaporates leaving sand, stones, dirt and \nother debris on the ramp surfaces. Only by re-grading the street and road \nasphalt at these transitions can this ponding of water be ended. In sum, the \nmajority of these curb ramps are not readily accessible to and usable by \nPlaintiffs. The same is true of the two WCRC curb ramps at the crossing \nSilver Maples Drive at the intersection with Old U.S. 12. \n  I. Withing the last two years, Plaintiffs Shauna Mote and Deborah \nClark attempted to use these curb ramps, and found them to be not readily \naccessible to and usable by them. These WCRC curb ramps presented a \nserious  tipping  hazard.  These  inaccessible  curb  ramps  hindered  these \nPlaintiffs  from  entering  the  Chelsea  Community  Fair  “handicapped” \n  23 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-11546-DML-EAS   ECF No. 65, PageID.1750   Filed 05/22/17   Page 24 of 37\nentrance and from enjoying the Fair Parade. They also prevent access to the \nHometown Holiday Parade. \n  53. Many of the Plaintiffs know each other. Each Plaintiff’s residence \nis fully accessible, but it operates as an oasis, due to the fact that the nearby \npedestrian crossings, sidewalks and other street level pedestrian walkways, \nand  other  services,  programs  and  activities  each  suffer  from  the  defects \ndescribed herein. Each Plaintiff is hampered from inviting other Plaintiffs \nand similarly situated friends from joining them in exercising or otherwise \nparticipating in everything others take for granted throughout Chelsea.  \n  54. And, snow and ice make each of these barriers to access worse. \nEach Plaintiff has had to avoid downtown Chelsea for extended periods due \nto  snow  and  ice on  the  sidewalks,  curb  ramps  and  street  crossings,  and \nmunicipal  parking.  Defendants’  plowing  operations  and  property  owners \nneed training in how to avoid these barriers to access. \n  55.  Summary  of  Examples  of  Defendants’  Discrimination.  The \nabove examples are not exhaustive. Rather, they are illustrations of several \nof  policies  followed  by  each  Defendant,  that,  taken  together,  render \nDefendants’  facilities,  services,  programs  and  activities,  when  viewed  in \ntheir entirely, not readily accessible to and usable by Plaintiffs and class \nmembers. Without Court intervention to correct Defendants’ discrimination, \n  24 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-11546-DML-EAS   ECF No. 65, PageID.1751   Filed 05/22/17   Page 25 of 37\nthese will remain not readily accessible to and usable by Plaintiffs and class \nmembers. \nVI. CAUSES OF ACTION \n \nFIRST CAUSE OF ACTION: CLASS-WIDE FINAL INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \nCLAIM UNDER TITLE II OF THE AMERICANS WITH \nDISABILITIES ACT \n \n56. Plaintiffs incorporate by reference the allegations of paragraphs 1 \nthrough  55  above,  inclusive.  Plaintiffs  bring  this  count  for  class-wide \ndeclaratory and final injunctive relief, but not money damages, under Title II \nof the Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA). \n  57. Title II of the ADA prohibits covered public entities from denying \nindividuals with disabilities “the benefits of ” any “program” or “activity” or \n“service[]” of a covered entity on the basis of disability. 42 U.S.C. 12132. \nAs  the  Supreme  Court  has  recognized,  those  statutory  terms  are \nunambiguously broad. See Pennsylvania Dep’t of Corr. v. Yeskey, 524 U.S. \n206, 212 (1998). Section 504 specifically provides that “the term ‘program \nor activity’ means all of the operations of  ” a covered public entity, 29 \nU.S.C.  794(b)  (emphasis  added),  and  Congress  required  Title  II  to  be \ninterpreted at least as broadly as Section 504, see 42 U.S.C. 12201(a).  \n  25 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-11546-DML-EAS   ECF No. 65, PageID.1752   Filed 05/22/17   Page 26 of 37\n  58. Among other things, Title II of the Americans With Disabilities Act \nrequires that when a public entity builds or alters1 any part of a facility after \nJanuary 26, 1992, it shall, to the maximum extent possible, be altered so that \nit  is  readily  accessible  to  and  usable by  individuals  with  disabilities. 42 \nU.S.C. §§ 12132; 28 C.F.R. § 35.151(a), (b) & (i). This includes, among \nother things, resurfacing or other alterations of Defendants’ roads and walks. \nAbility Center, 385 F.3d 913-914; Frame v. City of Arlington, 657 F.3d 215 \n(5th Cir. 2011); Kinney v. Yerusalim, 9 F.3d 1067 (3rd Cir.1993)(cert. denied \nsub nom Hoskins v. Kinney, 114 S.Ct. 1545, 128 L.Ed.2d 196 (1994). Many \nof defendants’ roads, walks and parking lots at issue in this lawsuit have \nbeen “altered” after 1991 “by, on behalf of, or for the use” of each of the \nDefendants”, but are not “to the maximum extent possible readily usable by \nand  accessible  to”  Plaintiffs.  Id.  Indeed,  as  set  forth  in  the  facts  above, \nDefendants’ street level transit stops, pedestrian crossings, sidewalks and \nother street level pedestrian walkways deny access to Plaintiffs. And, each \naltered walk, road and curb cut must meet the ADA Standards. 28 C.F.R. § \n35.151(c). By altering sidewalks and other street level pedestrian walkways \nwithout making them, to the maximum extent feasible, accessible to and \n                                                      \n1 Throughout this document “alter, altered, or alteration” have the definition \nset forth in Joint Technical Assistance July 2013 and its Supplemental Q and \nA January 2015. These are available at on the USDOJ website as  \nhttp://www.ada.QOv/doj-fhwa-ta-supplement-201S.htm I.\n \n  26 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-11546-DML-EAS   ECF No. 65, PageID.1753   Filed 05/22/17   Page 27 of 37\nusable  by  Plaintiffs,  each  Defendant  violates  the  ADA.  Ability  Center, \nsupra, Kinney, supra, and Frame, supra. \n  59. Title II regulations promulgated by the Department of Justice state \nthat  “[n]o  qualified  individual  with  a  disability  shall,  on  the  basis  of \ndisability, * * * be denied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities \nof  a public  entity.”  28 C.F.R.  35.130. As  stated  herein,  Defendants’  are \nproviding services, programs or activities that, when viewed in their entirety, \nare not readily accessible to and usable by Plaintiffs. As the Sixth Circuit \nrecently stated: \nThe conclusion that sidewalks may qualify as a service is supported \nby a 2004 decision from this court, a Title II implementing regulation, \nand the Justice Department's amicus briefs in several sidewalk cases. \n \nBabcock v Michigan, 812 F.3d 531, 543 (6th Cir. 2016) (Rogers, concurring). \n“The agency's interpretation of its own regulations is entitled to substantial \ndeference.” Id., at 544. \n60.  As  the  Department  of  Justice  has  stated,  the  curb  ramp \nrequirements  in  the  Title  II  regulations  were  premised  on  the  view  that \n“maintenance  of  pedestrian  walkways  by  public  entities  is  a  covered \nprogram.” 60 Fed. Reg. 58,462 (1995) (notice of proposed rulemaking). That \nposition, embodied in the Department of Justice’s regulations implementing \n  27 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-11546-DML-EAS   ECF No. 65, PageID.1754   Filed 05/22/17   Page 28 of 37\nTitle  II,  is  entitled  to  substantial deference.  See  Chevron  U.S.A.,  Inc.  v. \nNatural Res. Def. Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 844 (1984).   \n  61.  Moreover,  in  subsequent  legislation,  Congress  has  explicitly \nrecognized that “public sidewalks” are covered by Title II. Section 1108 of \nthe Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century, Pub. L. No. 105-178, \n112 Stat. 107 (23 U.S.C. 133(b)(3)), which was passed in 1998, authorizes \nthe  use  of  federal  funds  set  aside  for  transportation  improvements \nundertaken by the States for “the modification of public sidewalks to comply \nwith the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990.” \n  62. Providing and maintaining a network of walkways for pedestrians \nto get around town is a quintessential, not to mention ages old, government \nservice. A city’s provision and maintenance of sidewalks, curbs, on-street \nparking  and  parking  lots  clearly  constitute  a  “service[],  program[],  or \nactivit[y],” 42 U.S.C. 12132, under Title II of the ADA. As the Ninth Circuit \nheld in Barden, “maintenance of public sidewalks * * * is a normal function \nof a municipal entity.” Barden v. City of Sacramento, 292 F.3d 1073, 1077 \n(9th Cir. 2002), cert. denied, 539 U.S. 958 (2003) (sidewalks are a service, \nprogram or activity for purposes of the ADA, and are a service or program \nfor purposes of Section 504). And, as the Supreme Court has recognized in \nanother  context,  the  provision  of  sidewalks  is  an  archetypal  “general \n  28 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-11546-DML-EAS   ECF No. 65, PageID.1755   Filed 05/22/17   Page 29 of 37\ngovernment service[].” Everson v. Board of Educ., 330 U.S. 1, 17-18 (1947) \n(noting that there is no Establishment Clause difficulty in giving churches \naccess  to  “such  general  government  services  as  ordinary  police  and  fire \nprotection,  connections  for  sewage  disposal,  public  highways  and \nsidewalks”).  Sidewalks  permit  the  public  not  only  to  stay  clear  of  road \ntraffic, but to access shops and businesses, means of public transportation, \nplaces of employment, and government offices and facilities. And for “time \nout of mind,” sidewalks have been used for the purpose of public association \nand speech. Boos v. Barry, 485 U.S. 312, 318 (1988) (quoting Hague v. \nCIO, 307 U.S. 496, 515 (1939) (opinion of Roberts, J.)).  \n  63. Likewise, the City, the DDA and MDOT’s provision of on-street \nparking is a “service, program or activity” of defendants. See Fortyune, 766 \nF.3d 1102-03. None of these parking spaces is accessible to Plaintiffs. When \nviewed in its entirety, it is not readily accessible to and usable by Plaintiffs.  \n64.  After  constructing  or  altering  a facility,  each  Defendant “shall \nmaintain in operable working condition those features of facilities that are \nrequired to be readily accessible to and usable by persons with disabilities by \nthe Act.” 28 C.F.R. § 35.133. Facilities required to be accessible include \nroads, walks, passageways and parking lots. 28 C.F.R. § 35.104. As set forth \nherein, each Defendant routinely fails to do this.  \n  29 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-11546-DML-EAS   ECF No. 65, PageID.1756   Filed 05/22/17   Page 30 of 37\n65. Defendants’ conduct in failing to maintain accessible facilities by \nfailing  to  replace  crumbling  and  uneven  pavement,  remove  protruding \nand/or  moveable  obstructions,  ensure  a  sufficiently  wide  path  of  travel, \ncorrect excessive cross-slopes and running slopes on roads and walks, failing \nto timely remove snow and ice, failing to remove gravel and other detritus \nfrom  walks  and  curb  ramps,  and  failing  to provide  compliant  accessible \nstreet level transit stops thus constitutes unlawful discrimination on the basis \nof disability in violation of Title II of the ADA. \n66. Each defendant is denying Plaintiffs participation in the services, \nprograms  or  activities  of  on-street  parking,  parades,  festivals  and  the \ncommunity  fair  due  to  lack  of  access  to  them.  Applying  the  general \nprohibition to facilities, the regulations provide that no one with a covered \ndisability “shall, because a public entity’s facilities are inaccessible to or \nunusable by individuals with disabilities, be excluded from participation in, \nor be denied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities of a public \nentity.” 28 C.F.R. 35.149. And the regulations expressly define “facility” to \ninclude “roads” and “walks” controlled by a public entity. 28 C.F.R. 35.104.  \n  67. Each Defendant is violating Title II’s access requirements set forth \nin  28  C.F.R.  §  149  (the  general  prohibition  against  discrimination);  28 \nC.F.R. § 150 (requiring accessibility of facilities existing prior to January 26, \n  30 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-11546-DML-EAS   ECF No. 65, PageID.1757   Filed 05/22/17   Page 31 of 37\n1992, the effective date of Title II); and, 28 C.F.R. § 151 (requiring that \nfacilities  newly  constructed  or  altered  after  January  26,  1992  be  fully \naccessible).  \n  68. Defendants’ inaccessible parking, sidewalks and street crossings \nstop  Plaintiffs  from  participating  in  Defendants’  services,  programs  or \nactivities, such as municipal parking lots, on-street parking, yearly parades, \nfestivals, fairs and the like, as well as a lack of an accessible route to and \nfrom the Courthouse, Police Station, City Hall, Post Office and Secretary of \nState’s offices. \n69.  Defendants'  conduct  constitutes  an  ongoing  and  continuous \nviolation of the ADA and unless restrained from doing so, Defendants will \ncontinue to violate the ADA. Said conduct, unless enjoined, will continue to \ninflict  injuries  for  which  Plaintiffs  have  no  adequate  remedy  at  law. \nConsequently,  Plaintiffs  are  entitled  to  final  injunctive  relief  pursuant  to \nsection 308 of the ADA 42 U.S.C. § 12188, and reasonable attorneys fees. \nSECOND CAUSE OF ACTION:  \nCLASS-WIDE CLAIM UNDER THE REHABILITATION ACT OF 1973 \n \n  70. Plaintiffs incorporate by reference the allegations of paragraphs 1 \nthrough 69, above, inclusive. Plaintiffs bring this count pursuant to Section \n504  of  the  Rehabilitation  Act  (RA)  for  class-wide  declaratory  and  final \ninjunctive relief, but not monetary relief.  \n  31 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-11546-DML-EAS   ECF No. 65, PageID.1758   Filed 05/22/17   Page 32 of 37\n  71. Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (RA) prohibits covered public \nentities  from  denying  individuals  with disabilities  “the benefits of  ” any \n“program” or “activity” of a covered entity on the basis of disability. 29 \nU.S.C. 794(a). As the Supreme Court has recognized, those statutory terms \nare unambiguously broad. See Yeskey, 524 U.S. 206, 212 (1998). Section \n504 specifically provides that “the term ‘program or activity’ means all of \nthe operations of  ” a covered public entity, 29 U.S.C. 794(b) (emphasis \nadded).  \n  72. The RA provides that \"[n]o otherwise qualified individual with a \ndisability  in  the  United  States  ...  shall,  solely  by  reason  of  her  or  his \ndisability, be excluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or \nbe  subjected  to  discrimination  under  any  program  or  activity  receiving \nFederal financial assistance.” 29 U.S.C. § 794(a) (Section 504 of the RA).  \n  73. The RA defines “program or activity” as “all of the operations of” a \nqualifying  local  government.  29  U.S.C.  §  794(B)(1)(A).  This  includes \nDefendants’ sidewalks, other street level pedestrian walkways, transit stops \nand  on-street  parking.  Barden,  supra;  Ability  Center,  supra;  Frame, \nFortyune, supra. \n  74.  The  RA  also  mandates  each  Defendant  to  make  each  “facility” \naccessible according to law. “The regulations define ‘facility’ as including \n  32 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-11546-DML-EAS   ECF No. 65, PageID.1759   Filed 05/22/17   Page 33 of 37\n‘roads, walks, [and] parking lots.’ 28 C.F.R. § 39.103.” Ability Center, 385 \nF.3rd 911, n. 10. \n  75. Upon information and belief, at all times relevant, each Defendant \nhas received federal financial assistance, which each has spent on one or \nmore of the alteration projects complained of herein.  \n  76.  Each  plaintiff  (1)  has  a  disability;  (2)  is  and  has  been  otherwise \nqualified  to  participate  in  Defendants’  federally  funded  programs  or \nactivities; and (3) was denied the benefits of the programs or activities or \nwas otherwise subject to discrimination because of his or her disability.2  \n  77.  As  detailed  above,  beginning  with  the  effective  date  of  the \nRehabilitation Act, and continuing each year to the present, each Defendant \nhas received federal money but has spent it engaging in a continuing pattern \nand  practice  of  over-arching  discrimination  against  Plaintiffs  and  class \nmembers by denying the benefits of, or subjecting them to discrimination \nunder several programs or activities receiving Federal financial assistance.   \n  78. Plaintiffs are entitled to declaratory relief, to final injunctive relief \nordering each Defendant to bring these facilities, programs or activities into \ncompliance, and Plaintiffs reasonable attorneys fees and costs.  \n                                                      \n2 Although the Rehab Act—passed in 1973—uses the term “handicapped”, \nCongress in the late 1980s stopped using this term because “individuals with \ndisabilities find the term ‘handicapped’ objectionable.” Helen L. v. Didario, \n46 F.3d 325, 333 n8 (3rd Cir. 1995).  \n \n  33 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-11546-DML-EAS   ECF No. 65, PageID.1760   Filed 05/22/17   Page 34 of 37\nCOUNT THREE: \nMICHIGAN PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES CIVIL RIGHTS ACT \n \n79. Plaintiffs incorporate by reference the allegations of paragraphs 1 \nthrough  78  above,  inclusive.  Plaintiffs  do  not  bring  this  claim  against \nMDOT. Plaintiffs bring this count for declaratory and final injunctive relief, \nbut not for monetary damages,  solely against defendant City of Chelsea and \ndefendant  Chelsea  DDA.  The  above  complained  of  failure by  these two \ndefendants  to  construct,  alter  and  maintain  their  services,  programs  or \nactivities to be accessible to Plaintiffs violates Michigan law at M.C.L. § \n37.1301-02. Plaintiffs are entitled to final injunctive and declaratory relief, \nattorney fees and costs. \n80.  The  Michigan  Persons  with  Disabilities  Civil  Rights  Act \n(PWDCRA) is built upon similar policy objective and legal standards as the \nADA,  and  the  ADA  and  PWDCRA  \"substantially  mirror\"  each  other. \nDonald v. Sybra, Inc., 667 F.3d 757, 764 (6th Cir. 2012). Therefore, \"claims \nunder  both  statutes  are  generally  analyzed  identically.\"  Steward  v.  New \nChrysler, 415 Fed.Appx. 632, 641 (6th Cir.2011).   \n81.  Defendants  Chelsea  and  Chelsea  DDA  are  a  “public  service” \nsubject to the PWDCRA’s Article 3. MCL 37.1301(b). Each Plaintiff has “a \ndisability” as defined in the statute. MCL 37.1103(d)(i)(B). Further, just as \nwith  the  ADA’s  “qualified  individual  with  a  disability”  provision,  each \n  34 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-11546-DML-EAS   ECF No. 65, PageID.1761   Filed 05/22/17   Page 35 of 37\nPlaintiff’s disability is “unrelated” to his or her ability to utilize and benefit \nfrom the city streets, pedestrian walkways and street level transit stops, with \nthe accommodation their mobility devices. MCL 37.1103(l). \n82. The PWDCRA provides that a public service cannot: \nDeny an individual the full and equal enjoyment of the goods, \nservices, facilities, privileges, advantages, and accommodations \nof a . . . public service because of a disability that is unrelated to \nthe individual’s ability to utilize and benefit from the goods, \nservices, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations \nor because of the use by any individual of adaptive devices or \naids. \n \n83. MCL 37.1302(a). Each Defendant’s streets, pedestrian crossings, \nstreet level pedestrian walkways, transit stops, municipal parking lots and \non-street parking, parades, festivals and community fair are “services and \nfacilities” of each Defendant. “Facilities include roads and walks”. 28 C.F.R. \n§ 35.104.” Ability Center, 385 F.3rd 904, n. 3. Also see, Barden; Frame, \nsupra. “The public streets [and sidewalks and other street level pedestrian \nwalkways]  involved  in  this  case  are  plainly  ‘services,’  ‘facilities,’  and \n‘advantages,’ provided and regulated by [each] Defendant.” Bertrand v. City \nof Mackinac Island, 256 Mich App 13; 662 NW2d 77 (2003)(analyzing the \nPWDCRA’s duties to pedestrians with disabilities). \n84.  Defendants  Chelsea  and  Chelsea  DDA  have  violated  the \nPWDCRA by denying each Plaintiff the full and equal enjoyment of the \n  35 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-11546-DML-EAS   ECF No. 65, PageID.1762   Filed 05/22/17   Page 36 of 37\nstreets, sidewalks and other pedestrian walkways despite Plaintiffs’ ability to \nuse and benefit from these if provided with the accommodation required by \nthe statute. MCL 37.1102(2). \n85. Plaintiffs are entitled to declaratory relief, to final injunctive relief \nordering these two Defendants to bring these services, programs or activities \ninto compliance, and Plaintiffs reasonable attorneys fees and costs. \nVII. PRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs pray for relief as follows: \n \nA. An final injunctive order and judgment enjoining each Defendant \nfrom  violating  the  Americans  with  Disabilities  Act,  Section  504  of  the \nRehabilitation  Act,  and  Defendants  Chelsea  and  Chelsea  DDA  from \nviolating Michigan’s Persons with Disabilities Civil Rights Act;  \nB.  A  final  declaration  that  the  services,  programs,  activities  and \nfacilities listed herein under the jurisdiction of Defendants, including the \nstreets, roads and highways, street level transit stops, sidewalks, and other \nstreet  level  pedestrian  walkways,  are  constructed,  designed,  and/or \nmaintained in a manner which discriminates against Plaintiffs and which \nfails to provide program access for persons with disabilities as required by \nlaw; \n  36 \n\nCase 2:16-cv-11546-DML-EAS   ECF No. 65, PageID.1763   Filed 05/22/17   Page 37 of 37",

On July 6, 2017, the parties submitted to the Court a proposed first\nconsent decree embodying the terms of their partial settlement.\nAccordingly, pursuant to the stipulations and the consent of the parties as set forth below,\nall of the following is ORDERED AND ADJUDGED.\nI. STIPULATIONS\nThe parties agree and stipulate as follows.\n1. On April 28, 2016, the plaintiffs filed a class-action complaint against the City of\nChelsea, Michigan, (“Chelsea”), Chelsea’s Downtown Development Authority, (“DDA”), and the\nMichigan Department of Transportation (“MDOT”) alleging violations of Title II of the Americans\nWith Disabilities Act (ADA), Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Michigan\nPersons With Disabilities Civil Rights Act (PWDCRA).\n2. On July 29, 2016, defendant City of Chelsea moved for leave to file a third-party\ncomplaint against the Washtenaw County Road Commission (“WCRC”), and the Court granted that\nmotion on August 1, 2016.  Chelsea filed its third-party complaint on August 5, 2016.  The plaintiffs\nlater filed an amended complaint that also named WCRC as a defendant.\n3. Defendants Chelsea and the DDA deny any violations of federal or Michigan law.\n4. The  plaintiffs  and  defendants  Chelsea  and  the  DDA  entered  into  significant\nsettlement negotiations and have reached an agreement to resolve a portion of the lawsuit.\nII. EXHIBITS\nThe following exhibits, the full texts of which are available online, are incorporated herein\nby reference, and the parties agree to refer to them for further guidance on the interpretation and\napplication of the terms of this consent decree where they are cited.  The parties also agree to follow\n-2-\n\nCase 2:16-cv-11546-DML-EAS   ECF No. 87, PageID.4227   Filed 08/04/17   Page 3 of 15\nthe guidance provided by those documents, unless anything stated in them is expressly contradicted\nby the terms of this consent decree.\n1. Exhibit 1 is the Department of Justice (DOJ) / Department of Transportation (DOT)\nJoint  Technical  Assistance  on  the  Title  II  of  the  Americans  With  Disabilities  Act  [ADA]\nRequirements to Provide Curb Ramps when Streets, Roads, or Highways are Altered through\nResurfacing,  which  was  published  on  July  8,  2013.  It  is  available  online  at\nhttp://fhwa.dot.gov/civilrights/programs/doj_fhwa_ta.cfm.\n2. Exhibit 2 is the Questions and Answers Supplement to the 2013 DOJ / DOT Joint\nTechnical Assistance, which was published on December 1, 2015. It is available online at\nhttp://www.ada.gov/doj-fhwa-ta-supplement-2015.html.\n3. Exhibit 3 is the USDOJ ADA Parking Compliance Brief, which was published in\nDecember  2015.  It  is  available  online  at  http://www.ada.gov/restripe.pdf; \nhttps://adata.org/factsheet/parking.\nThe parties also agree as a general matter that the Technical Assistance Manual of the\nDepartment of Justice (“TAM”), is persuasive authority as to the meaning of provisions in the ADA,\nunless it is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the ADA’s regulations.  See Noel v. New York City\nTaxi & Limousine Commission, 687 F.3d 63, 69 (2nd Cir. 2012); Innovative Health Systems, Inc.\nv. City of White Plains, 117 F.3d 37, 45 n.8. (2d Cir. 1997).\nIII. DEFINITIONS\nThe following terms and phrases shall be understood and applied throughout this consent\ndecree according to the definitions set forth below.\n-3-\n\nCase 2:16-cv-11546-DML-EAS   ECF No. 87, PageID.4228   Filed 08/04/17   Page 4 of 15\n1. Facility.  The term “facility” shall have the meaning set forth in 28 C.F.R. § 104. \nAmong other things, “facilities” include “roads,” “walks,” “pedestrian walkways,” and “parking\nlots.” Ability Center of Greater Toledo v. City of Sandusky, 385 F.3d 901, 904; 904 n.3, 911 n.10\n(6th Cir. 2004) (quoting 28 C.F.R. § 35.104; 28 C.F.R. § 39.103; USDOJ Title II Technical\nAssistance Manual §§ II-5.3000, II-6.6000).\n2. Alteration.  The terms “alter,” “altered,” and “alteration” shall be understood to\ncomprise any change to a building or facility that affects or could affect the usability of the building\nor facility or any portion thereof.  Alterations include, but are not limited to, remodeling, renovation,\nrehabilitation, reconstruction, historic restoration, resurfacing of circulation paths or vehicular ways,\nchanges or rearrangement of the structural parts or elements, and changes or rearrangement in the\nplan configuration of walls and full-height partitions.  See 2010 ADA Standards Definitions § 106.5. \nThe parties agree to rely upon the incorporated Exhibits 1, 2 and 3 for additional specific guidance\nas to the meaning of this term.\n3. By, on behalf of, or for the use of.  The phrase “by, on behalf of, or for the use of”\nshall be understood to comprise any construction or alteration where Chelsea or the DDA, prior to\nor  during  the  alteration,  expend  public  funds,  contract  for,  or  otherwise  expend  resources\n(engineering, planning, design, inspection, approval, etc.), or where, after completion of the\nalteration, they exercise full or partial control, regulation or other jurisdiction over the facility after\nit is constructed or altered.  This phrase, however, shall be interpreted consistently with the\nlimitations set forth below regarding Main Street (State Route 52) and Old U.S. Highway 12.\n4. To the maximum extent feasible.  The phrase “to the maximum extent feasible” shall\nhave the meaning set forth in 28 C.F.R. § 36.402(c).  This phrase applies to the occasional case\n-4-\n\nCase 2:16-cv-11546-DML-EAS   ECF No. 87, PageID.4229   Filed 08/04/17   Page 5 of 15\nwhere the nature of an existing facility makes it virtually impossible fully to comply with applicable\naccessibility standards through a planned alteration.  In these circumstances, the alteration shall\nprovide the maximum physical accessibility feasible.  Any altered features of the facility that can\nbe made accessible shall be made accessible.  If providing accessibility in conformance with this\nsection to individuals with certain disabilities (e.g., those who use wheelchairs) would not be\nfeasible, the facility shall be made accessible to persons with other types of disabilities (e.g., those\nwho use crutches, those who have impaired vision or hearing, or those who have other impairments).\n5. Other sloped area.  The phrase “other sloped area” means an accessible transition\nwith a running slope not exceeding 5 percent from a sidewalk to road surface.  By keeping the term\n“other sloped area,” the DOJ concluded that 28 C.F.R. 35.151(i) should acknowledge that there are\ntimes when there are transitions from sidewalk to road surface that do not technically qualify as\n“curb ramps” (sloped surfaces that have a running slope that exceed 5 percent). Therefore, the DOJ\ndecided not to delete the phrase “other sloped areas.”  See USDOJ Guidance on the 2010 Standards\nfor Accessible Design, 28 C.F.R. Part 35, App. A to Part 35, at 27-28 (September 15, 2010).\n6. Technically infeasible.  The phrase “technically infeasible” means, “[w]ith respect\nto an alteration of a building or a facility, something that has little likelihood of being accomplished\nbecause existing structural conditions would require removing or altering a load-bearing member\nthat is an essential part of the structural frame; or because other existing physical or site constraints\nprohibit modification or addition of elements, spaces, or features that are in full and strict\ncompliance with the minimum requirements.”  2010 ADA Standards § 106.5.\n-5-\n\nCase 2:16-cv-11546-DML-EAS   ECF No. 87, PageID.4230   Filed 08/04/17   Page 6 of 15\nIV. LIMITATIONS\n1. Limitation Relating to Putative Class.  This consent decree is enforceable only by the\nnamed plaintiffs.  The named plaintiffs have filed this case as a putative class action.  All of the\nnamed plaintiffs, as well as defendants City of Chelsea and its DDA fully intend that the final\nresolution of the lawsuit will occur after a putative class has been certified.  Nevertheless, solely for\npurposes of this first consent decree and partial settlement of claims, the plaintiffs and defendants\nChelsea and its DDA understand that this first consent decree shall be enforceable only by the\nnamed plaintiffs.  The parties agree that the named plaintiffs fully can enforce this first consent\ndecree, and that there is no need at this early stage of the lawsuit to engage in the multi-month\nprocess of class certification, class notice, and all that involves.  At the appropriate time in the\nfuture, the plaintiffs and defendants Chelsea and its DDA intend to file a joint motion for class\ncertification.\n2. Limitation Relating to MDOT and SR 52.  Although the plaintiffs have named\nMDOT as a defendant, MDOT is in no way a party to this first consent decree and partial settlement. \nSpecifically, MDOT’s State Route 52 runs from the north border to the south border of the City of\nChelsea, and is also designated as “Main Street” throughout Chelsea. The sidewalks along SR 52-\nMain Street and the connecting pedestrian crossings and on-street parking are in the MDOT\nright-of-way.  The plaintiffs claim that Chelsea, DDA, and MDOT are jointly liable for some or all\nof those items.  However, the parties hereby expressly agree to hold any decisions as to these items\nfor a future time, to allow time for negotiations among the parties and with MDOT.  While entering\ninto this consent decree, the plaintiffs and defendants Chelsea and its DDA expressly reserve all\nclaims, rights and defenses regarding those intersections, adjacent sidewalks, and on-street parking\n-6-\n\nCase 2:16-cv-11546-DML-EAS   ECF No. 87, PageID.4231   Filed 08/04/17   Page 7 of 15\nalong SR 52-Main Street, and nothing in this consent decree affects in any way any parties’ claims\nor defenses relating to those items.\n3. Limitation Relating to Defendant WCRC and Old U.S. Highway 12.  Although\nChelsea has named WCRC as a third-party defendant, and the plaintiff has filed an amended\ncomplaint naming WCRC as a defendant, WCRC is in no way a party to this first consent decree and\npartial settlement.  Specifically, WCRC’s Old U.S. Highway 12 runs from the west border to the east\nborder of the City of Chelsea.  The sidewalks and the shoulders where there is no accessible\nsidewalk along Old U.S. Highway 12 and the connecting pedestrian crossings are in the WCRC\nright-of-way. The plaintiffs claim that defendants Chelsea, MDOT, and WCRC are jointly liable for\nsome or all of those items.  However, the parties hereby expressly agree to hold any decisions as to\nthose items for a future time, to allow time for negotiations among all of the parties.  While entering\ninto this consent decree, the plaintiffs and defendants Chelsea and its DDA expressly reserve all\nclaims, rights and defenses regarding those intersections, adjacent sidewalks and relevant shoulders\nalong Old U.S. Highway 12, and nothing in this consent decree affects in any way any parties’\nclaims or defenses about these.\nV. FUTURE CONSTRUCTION AND ALTERATIONS\n1. Future Construction and Alterations Under 28 C.F.R. §§ 35.151(a)-(c).  The City of\nChelsea and its DDA shall ensure beginning January 1, 2016 and thereafter that each facility or part\nof a facility altered  by, on behalf of, or for the use of Chelsea or its DDA in a manner that affects\nor could affect the usability of the facility or part of the facility shall, to the maximum extent\nfeasible,  be altered in such manner that the altered portion of the facility is readily accessible to and\nusable by individuals with disabilities.  The term “readily accessible to and usable by individuals\n-7-\n\nCase 2:16-cv-11546-DML-EAS   ECF No. 87, PageID.4232   Filed 08/04/17   Page 8 of 15\nwith disabilities” shall mean that the alteration is in strict compliance with the ADA 2010 Standards.\nThe 2010 Standards are available online http://www.ada.gov/2010ADAstandards_index.htm. 28\nC.F.R. § 35.151(c).\n2. Future Construction and Alterations Under 28 C.F.R. §§ 35.151(i)(1)-(2).  Beginning\nJanuary 1, 2016, and continuing through the life of this consent decree, defendant Chelsea shall\nensure that when streets, roads, or highways are newly built or altered, ramps or sloped areas shall\nbe installed wherever there are curbs or other barriers to entry from a sidewalk or pedestrian path,\nand where the direction of a sidewalk or pedestrian path intersects a street, road, or highway.\nLikewise, when new sidewalks or pedestrian paths are built or are altered, curb ramps or sloped\nareas shall be installed wherever sidewalks or pedestrian paths would, if not for a curb or other\nbarrier, such as a strip of grass between the sidewalk and the street, road or highway, intersect\nstreets, roads, or highways.  28 C.F.R. § 35.151(i); USDOJ Title II Technical Assistance Manual §\n6.6000.  Generally, this will mean that where pedestrian walks exist, there will be six curb ramps\nor other sloped areas at each “T” intersection, and eight curb ramps or other sloped areas at each “+”\nor “plus” intersection.  Cost and other undue burden shall not be a defense for a failure to comply\nwith the requirements of this section.\n3. Special Exception for “Jogged Intersections.”  As with other “plus” intersections, a\ntotal of eight curb ramps shall be installed at jogged intersections, that is, where a road does not\nalign with itself when intersecting another road.  However, jogged intersections should not have two\nramps at each of the four corners.  Instead, the ramps should be placed so that pedestrians are\nencouraged to walk across the straight road on either side of the jogged road, not between the two\nportions of the jogged road.\n-8-\n\nCase 2:16-cv-11546-DML-EAS   ECF No. 87, PageID.4233   Filed 08/04/17   Page 9 of 15\n4. Prohibited Reduction of or Lesser Level of Accessibility.  Any alteration that\ndecreases or has the effect of decreasing the accessibility of a facility below the requirements for\nnew construction at the time of the alteration is prohibited.  2010 ADA Standards § 202.3.1.  No\nfacility alteration or maintenance work shall result in a lesser level of accessibility.  See 28 C.F.R.\n§ 35.133(a); Exhibit 1 at Q&A Nos. 11-12.\n5. Road or Walk Alteration Project Scope and Limits.  The plaintiffs and defendant\nChelsea are mindful of the principle that “Public entities should not structure the scope of work to\navoid ADA obligations to provide curb ramps when resurfacing a roadway.  For example,\nresurfacing only between crosswalks may be regarded as an attempt to circumvent a public entity’s\nobligation under the ADA, and potentially could result in legal challenges.”  Exhibit 1, Answer No.\n3.  Therefore, purely for settlement purposes, the plaintiffs and Chelsea agree that whenever Chelsea\nalters or resurfaces a Chelsea street, road, highway or sidewalk which intersects with a Chelsea\nstreet, resurfacing reaches into the one-third (1/3) of the block closest to the next intersection.\nOtherwise, any such partial alteration or resurfacing only shall be performed to alter those limited\nareas which are subject to excessive wear at intersections.  Chelsea agrees and covenants that it will\nnot engage in any partial alteration or resurfacing of such blocks for the purpose, intent or design\nof avoiding or delaying the performance of its obligations to repair or install curb ramps or other\nsloped areas at the Chelsea intersection.\n6. Challenges That Full Accessibility is “Technically Infeasible.”  Where existing\nfacilities are altered, each altered element or space shall comply with the 2010 ADA Standards.  See\n2010 ADA Standards § 202.3.  In alterations, where the defendants assert that full and strict\ncompliance is “technically infeasible”, the alteration shall comply with the requirements to the\n-9-\n\nCase 2:16-cv-11546-DML-EAS   ECF No. 87, PageID.4234   Filed 08/04/17   Page 10 of 15\nmaximum extent feasible.  See 2010 ADA Standards § 202.3.2.  The parties agree to use the\nfollowing procedure regarding any claims of technical infeasability.  If, during the course of\nconstruction, alteration or resurfacing after January 1, 2016, in the rare circumstance that defendants\nChelsea or the DDA believe that any particular facility or portion of a facility prohibits construction\nor alteration in full compliance with the 2010 ADA Standards, then the defendant shall notify\nplaintiffs’ counsel in writing via certified mail and via email of such finding.  The written\nnotification shall list the engineer(s) who have reviewed the facility or portion of the facility, the\nlocation of each facility, and the Standard or measurement(s) which allegedly cannot be met.  The\nnotification shall include a statement of all reasons why compliance is technically infeasible and\nshall include all supporting materials on which the defendant relied in making its evaluation.  The\nnotification also shall state how the defendant proposes to deviate from the Standards.  Special\nattention shall be given to the measurements of the direct slope and the cross-slope of any walkway,\ncrossing, curb ramp or ramp, and the juncture of the pedestrian crossing with the ramp and the ramp\nwith the pedestrian walkway, and the level landing at the top and bottom of each ramp.

MOTE, DEBORAH CLARK, \nCARLOS GRAY-LION, BRENDA BARANIAK, \nKAREN STREET, MERLYN STREET, \nLEE BENTON, by his next friends RONALD M. \nBENTON and MARION BENTON, J.N., a minor,    Case Number 16-11546 \nby his next friends DANIEL and MARY JANE    Honorable David M. Lawson \nNELSON, ANN ARBOR CENTER FOR \nINDEPENDENT LIVING, INC., and \nJENNIFER KUNDAK, \n \nPlaintiffs, \nv. \n \nCITY OF CHELSEA, CHELSEA DOWNTOWN \nDEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY, and \nWASHTENAW COUNTY ROAD COMMISSION, \n \nDefendants, \n \nand \n \nCITY OF CHELSEA, \n \nThird-party plaintiff, \nv. \n \nWASHTENAW COUNTY ROAD COMMISSION, \n \nThird-party defendant. \n___________________________________________/ \n \n  OPINION AFTER TRIAL \n \n  This case concerns the sidewalks, curbs, and intersections in the City of Chelsea, Michigan, \nand their accessibility to persons with disabilities.  In a second amended complaint, the plaintiffs \n— Shauna Mote and several other disabled individuals, joined by the Ann Arbor Center for \n-1- \n \n\nIndependent Living — allege violations of the Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA), the \nRehabilitation Act, and Michigan’s Persons With Disabilities Civil Rights Act, based primarily on  \nthe condition of certain sidewalk curb ramps within the City of Chelsea.  The individual plaintiffs \nare disabled persons who live, work, or frequently travel to and within the City of Chelsea, \nMichigan, and who each require the use of a wheelchair, braces, cane, or other assistive devices in \norder to get around.  Plaintiff Ann Arbor Center for Independent Living is an association that \nrepresents disabled persons such as the plaintiffs throughout southeastern Michigan, including in \nChelsea.  They contend in their second amended complaint that the public streets and sidewalks in \nthe City of Chelsea recently have become less than fully accessible to them due to City approvals \nof renovations by private businesses adjacent to public sidewalks and streets making those \nfacilities inaccessible.  They allege that the City of Chelsea and its Downtown Development \nAuthority (DDA), along with the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) and the \nWashtenaw County Road Commission (WCRC), have created or facilitated violations of the ADA \nwithin certain public pedestrian areas in the City by allowing businesses to renovate storefronts \nwithout including appropriate accessibility measures, and by removing previously constructed \nphysical accommodations for wheelchair users, such as curb ramps at some intersections.   \n  On May 22, 2017, the plaintiffs filed their second amended complaint, alleging violations \nof ADA Title II (Count I) and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Count II) against the City of Chelsea, \nthe City’s Downtown Development Authority, and MDOT.  The complaint also raises a congruent \nclaim against the City of Chelsea only under Michigan’s Persons With Disabilities Civil Rights \nAct (PWDCRA).  With leave granted, the City of Chelsea filed a third-party complaint against the \nWCRC, which the City contends has exclusive control over and responsibility for certain roadways \n-2- \n \n\nwithin its city limits.  The plaintiffs later entered into a consent decree with the City of Chelsea, \nand they filed their second amended complaint naming WCRC as a principal defendant. \n  After motion practice resulted in the dismissal of the case against the MDOT, realigned the \nparties, and narrowed the issues, the case came on for trial on May 29, 2018 before the Court \nsitting without a jury.  Fourteen witnesses testified (four by deposition) and the Court received 73 \nexhibits.  Afterward, the parties submitted proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law.   \n  The disputed trial issues concerned the construction of the curb ramps installed at six \nintersections along a stretch of Old US-12 in the southern part of Chelsea, with the main focus on \nfour of those intersections.  The parties’s exhibits throughout the case have included drawings and \ndiagrams of the intersections, which use a “Ramp Location Index.”  That index identifies each \nintersection’s potential ramp location with ordinal numbers “1” through “8,” beginning with the \nnorthwest corner of an intersection — ramp “1” is the south-facing location — then proceeding \nclockwise until the southwest corner, with “8” being the north-facing location.  (In the case of a \n“T” intersection, at least two of the ordinal locations would be inapplicable.).  The Court will \ncontinue to use those designation here.   \n  The  following  constitutes  the  Court’s  findings  of  fact  under  Federal  Rule  of  Civil \nProcedure 52(a)(1), based on the record evidence, followed by its application of the governing law.   \nI.  Factual Findings \nA.  The Plaintiffs \n \n  Shauna Mote, a 35-year Chelsea resident, lost both legs in an automobile accident in \nFebruary 2005.  She uses a wheelchair and a scooter.  She rarely uses her prosthetics to ambulate.  \nFor transportation, Ms. Mote is able to use a van by transferring from the wheelchair to the vehicle, \nfor which she must maintain her upper body strength.   \n-3- \n \n\n  Ms.  Mote  described  her  experiences  going  to  events  in  Chelsea  and  navigating  the \nsidewalks and intersections along Old US-12.  When she attended parades in 2016, she parked in \na handicap-accessible lot, passing through the parking lot to the south side of Old US-12 to cross \nover at Manchester Street.  She described the curb ramp at the Manchester Street intersection as \nsteep with a large crack at the bottom and a big asphalt “lip” where the ramp joins the street.  The \nramp has a cross-slope, causing difficulty proceeding straight down.  There is a pothole in the \ncrosswalk.  On a different day, her front caster became lodged in a crack in the sidewalk ramp.   \n  On another occasion, her companion, Debra Clark, also wheelchair bound, encountered \naccessibility difficulty when her power wheelchair became mired in the mud and grass at one of \nthe ramps at the intersection of Old US-12 and Taylor Street.  She described similar debris and \ngrowing grass at the Lane Street intersection ramp, which she characterized as “steep.”  Her \nhusband had to help her traverse that ramp.  At Arthur Street, there was grass growing in the ramp.  \nOnce she and her companions reached their destination, rain began and lasted for about 20 minutes.  \nWhen she tried to return to her van, there was standing water that obscured the ramps and the \ntransitions to the asphalt.  She was unable to access the ramps without her husband’s help.  She \nsaid that all the ramps on Old US-12 were littered with debris.   \n  Brenda Baraniak lived in Chelsea for seven years.  She suffered a spinal cord injury, \nleaving her paralyzed from the waist down.  She uses a manual wheel chair for mobility, and she \ntransfers to a van for transportation.   \n  Ms. Baraniak described her experience in August 2014 when she took her granddaughter \nto the Chelsea Fair.  She parked at a mall across from the Fairgrounds and used the curb ramp to \ncross Manchester Road at Old US-12.  She said the ramp leaned one way and there was a “lip” at \n-4- \n \n\nthe bottom where the curb ramp met the asphalt.  She could not proceed on her own and needed \nhelp getting back in the crosswalk.  Her daughter had to help her up the ramp on the opposite side \nof the intersection because of the slant on one side of the ramp.  There was water, sand, dirt, and \nstones on the detectable warning of the ramp and the Silver Maples Road intersection with Old \nUS-12.  She identified photographs that depicted the hazards she described in her testimony.   \n  Karen Street testified that she has been paralyzed in her right lower extremity since 1954 \nwhen she contracted polio.  She tried to walk using two canes, but for longer distances she uses a \npowered scooter.  Ms. Street has lived in Chelsea for 41 years.  She frequents a retirement \ncommunity on Silver Maples Drive.  She testified that she cannot use the curb ramp at that \nintersection with Old US-12 when there is standing water.  She described an experience in the \nsummer of 2016 when she encountered difficulty with the curb ramp at Silver Maples Drive; the \nramp was full of sand, which accumulated because the ramp slopes toward the center.  She found \nthat water stands in the ramps for a considerable time after a rainfall.   \n  Merlyn Street, Karen’s husband, testified that he has had limited walking ability since he \ncontracted polio in 1952.  He is able to walk about ten feet with assistance.  He stated that he would \nlike to cross Old US-12 at Silver Maples Drive if he could.  But the conditions there, as described \nby his wife, prevent him from doing that.    \n  Lee Benton testified that he was paralyzed on the left side of his body from cerebral palsy.  \nHe uses a motorized chair for mobility, which he controls with a joy stick using his right hand.  \nThe chair weighs 900 pounds.  Mr. Benton travels from Ann Arbor using the Way Bus, gets off at \nMain Street, and works his way down Old US-12.  On one occasion, traveling to the Chelsea Fair, \nhe noticed grass and debris at the curb ramp intersections.  When it rained, there frequently was \n-5- \n \n\nstanding water.  The impediments caused him to lose his balance.  If he loses touch with his joy \nstick, he has to ask a stranger to help him readjust his body in the chair.  He noted that there was \ngrass growing on some of the curb ramps, and the cross slopes cause his body to lean to the left.  \nSometimes at the Old Manchester Road intersection, he has to go out into the roadway to cross \nover.  At the other side of the intersection, the cross slope makes him lean when ascending the \nramp.  And other times when he hits a bump on the ramp transition, his wheels get stuck.   \n  Jennifer  Kundak,  a  26-year  Chelsea  resident,  has  degenerative  disc  disease  with \nimpingement in her lumbar spine.  She has chronic leg pain, which causes difficulty walking and \nshe drags her right foot.  She attends the Wellness Center on Old US-12 near the Silver Maples \nDrive intersection.  She does not use the curb ramps at the Silver Maples Drive intersection because \ndebris, gravel, mud, and broken pavement interfere with her walking there.   \n  Deborah L. Clark testified by deposition that she has had multiple sclerosis for more than \n30 years, which caused a steady decline of her motor functions so that she now needs to use a \nwheelchair all the time to move around.  She also has a van that is modified to accommodate her \nwheelchair and which allows her to drive using hand controls.  Clark lives in Grass Lake, \nMichigan, and in 2014 she began to attend services at St. Mary’s Church in Chelsea, Michigan.  \nThe church is located on Old US-12 within the City, near the intersection with Silver Maples \nStreet.  Clark began to attend services at St. Mary’s to get out of the house and meet people after \nher husband died.  The priest at the church told her about events that happen in Chelsea like parades \nand the Sights and Sounds fair. \n  The first time that Clark tried to attend a parade in Chelsea, she parked in the parking lot \nof the shopping mall on Old US-12 near the intersection with Manchester Road.  At the curb cut \n-6- \n \n\nfor that intersection, while crossing US-12 from south to north, Clark was “jolted” in her \nwheelchair while descending the curb cut to the street.  She had a similar “jolting” feeling while \nusing the curb cut at the intersection of Taylor Street.  Clark stated that she had similar difficulties \nwith the intersections she used along Old US-12 each time she tried to attend parades in 2014 and \n2016.  She also stated that at the same intersections with Manchester, Silver Maples, and Taylor \nstreets there are “large potholes that make some of the curb ramps unusable.”  In addition to the \n“jolting” sensation she felt when navigating the curb cuts, Clark testified that when she tried to \nattend a parade in the Summer of 2014, the curb cuts and sidewalks prevented her from getting as \nfar as she wanted to travel along the parade route, and she could not get to a shaded area.  Unable \nto reach any shade, she gave up and left early without seeing the entire parade.  The jolting that \nshe experienced when going up or down curb ramps caused Clark’s hands to shift on the controls \nof her electric wheelchair, which made it difficult for her to control her chair and made her feel \nunsafe. \n  Carlos Gray-Lion also testified by deposition.  He has lived on West Summit Street in \nChelsea since 1999.  He had a stroke in 2006, causing the loss of full use of the right side of his \nbody.  He can walk between 10 and 20 feet using a walker, but for mobility over any longer \ndistance he has to use a wheelchair.  When he leaves his home, Gray-Lion always has his caretaker, \nJoanne Ladio, go with him to push the wheelchair, because it is unmotorized and he cannot move \nwith it on his own. \n  Gray-Lion testified that he most recently tried to attend the Sights and Sounds fair in \nChelsea in 2016, and that, even with his caretaker’s help, “in a wheelchair it’s almost impossible \n. . . to maneuver up and down the sidewalks along Old US-12.”  Gray-Lion said that around the \n-7- \n \n\nintersection of Will Johnson Drive and US-12, near Silver Maples, there were “mud puddle[s] \ngalore.”  He stated that the rain (and, in the winter, snow) made it impossible to navigate the curb \nramps for the sidewalks along Old US-12, and that it often would be 24 to 48 hours after a rain \nbefore the ramps would dry out and become passable again for a wheelchair. \n  Marijane Nelson sued on behalf of her minor son, J.N. (age 12).  She testified by deposition \nthat J.N. was born with spina bifida and is paralyzed from the waist down.  He uses forearm \ncrutches to walk and sometimes uses a manual wheelchair which he moves on his own.  J.N. has \nsometimes walked as far as 400 yards on crutches, but when they go to areas with crowds he is in \nthe wheelchair for his safety.  Since 2014 J.N. has participated in a summer race through downtown \nChelsea known as Run for the Rolls.  Part of the race route covers M-52 going south, then turning \nonto Old US-12 heading west toward Taylor Street.  J.N. most recently participated in the race in \nAugust 2016. \n  Nelson testified that she has to be careful and keep a close watch on J.N. any time he is \ntraveling along sidewalks because the clearance of his feet to the ground in the wheelchair may \ncause him to get stuck on uneven or sloped surfaces, and sometimes he has gotten a crutch stuck \nand tripped.  Nelson focused on J.N.’s problems navigating the curb ramps at the crosswalk to \ncross Taylor street while traveling east to west along the north side of US-12, which was part of \nthe route that they used to return to their car after the race.  Nelson attested that J.N. had a \n“tendency” to “clip his toes” or get his crutches caught where there was not a “smooth transition” \nfrom the curb ramp to the crosswalk.   \n  The plaintiffs also offered the deposition testimony of Carolyn Grawi, the full-time \nExecutive Director of plaintiff Ann Arbor Center for Independent Living (AACIL).  She said that \n-8- \n \n\nshe also works part-time as an instructor in the School of Social Work at the University of \nMichigan.  Grawi manages all of the business affairs of the AACIL, plans conferences and events, \nprovides services to members who are disabled persons, and supervises a staff of 16 employees.  \nEach year the organization provides services to between 3,500 and 5,000 disabled persons living \nin Washtenaw County.  The AACIL’s operations are funded primarily by grants from the State of \nMichigan and the federal government.  The organization’s annual budget is $1 million, mostly \nfrom government grants, but about $130,000 comes from charitable donations.  Grawi is paid a \nsalary of $75,000 per year and works at least 1,980 hours per year as a full-time employee. \n  Grawi testified that she has not personally had occasion to use any crosswalks along Old \nUS-12, but she had observed on many occasions that numerous sidewalk ramps along the road \nwere inundated with water, including many that she observed during the drive to the location of \nher deposition on February 7th.  Grawi stated that her organization received complaints from \nmembers  including  plaintiffs  Shauna  Mote,  Deborah  Clark,  and  Brenda  Baraniak,  about \ndifficulties that they had using the sidewalks along Old US-12 in Chelsea.  Grawi and the \nindividual plaintiffs as her members “spent quite a bit of time talking about the different areas” \nthat have accessibility problems along US-12.  The time Grawi spent considering those problems \nwas time that could not be devoted to other activities of the AACIL, like providing services to \nmembers.  Grawi also communicated by email and had phone calls with the plaintiffs and members \nof AACIL’s board about the sidewalk issues.  Grawi also conferred with plaintiffs’ counsel and \ntestified at a deposition in this litigation regarding the problems with the sidewalks along Old US-\n12.  Grawi attested that all of the time that she spent relating to this litigation would have been \n-9- \n \n\nspent providing services to members of the AACIL in other ways, if she had not been required to \npursue the lawsuit.  \nB.  Old US-12 Intersections \n1.  Construction Project \n \n  Old US-12 is a county road under the exclusive domain of the WCRC.  In 2007, the WCRC \ncarried out the “Old U.S. 12 Resurfacing Project,” which was referred to in project documents as \nbeing undertaken “in cooperation with the Michigan Department of Transportation.”  The project \ncalled for resurfacing Old US-12 with hot asphalt cold milling from 120 feet west of its intersection \nwith Wilkinson Street to 75 feet west of its intersection with State Highway M-52. The project \nwas to include ADA-complaint concrete sidewalk ramps and curb and gutter repair work.  The \nproject log stated that the “improvements covered by [it would be] constructed in accordance with \nthe Michigan Department of Transportation 2003 standard specifications for construction,” and it \nincluded drawings and specifications for, among other things, “sidewalk ramp details,” “concrete \nsidewalks,” and “concrete curb[s].”  The referenced specifications were found in MDOT Standard \nR-28-F.  \n  The project log stated that “all sidewalk ramps” within the work zone would be “replaced \nand/or relocated with ADA compliant ramps.”  An accompanying letter from WCRC officials \nstated that the County required a permit to be issued by the City of Chelsea for work to be \nperformed within the City limits, before it could “submit a final engineering package to the \nMichigan Department of Transportation Local Agency Section.”  That letter noted that the work \nwould  include  “reconstruction  of  the  sidewalk  drops  to  become  compliant  with  ADA \nrequirements” at the intersections with Lane Street, Arthur Street, and Old Manchester Road.  \n-10- \n \n\nSubsequently, the WCRC entered into a contract with MDOT to procure financing for the project \nfrom MDOT.  The project was financed with federal funds.   \n  The City of Chelsea did not exercise any control over the WCRC’s construction activity \nwithin the WCRC right-of-way.  Christine Linfield, Chelsea’s city engineer, testified that there \nwas no statutory authority to do so.  However, Chelsea required a permit for any WCRC \nconstruction outside the WCRC right-of-way connecting city streets for asphalt cutting, patching, \nand placement of signs within the city limits.  In turn, the WCRC required the City to obtain \npermits for any construction or maintenance activity within the county right-of-way.  WCRC \npermits require City projects to follow WCRC-approved specifications, and they are subject to \ninspection by the WCRC upon completion.   \n2.  Curb Ramps and Intersections \n  The curb ramps at issue in this case are two (2) at the intersection of Old US-12 and \nWilkinson Street, four (4) at the intersection of Old US-12 and Lane Street, four (4) at the \nintersection of Old US-12 and Arthur Street, six (6) at the intersection of Old US-12 and Taylor \nStreet/Old Manchester Road, and two at the intersection of Old US-12 and Silver Maples Drive.  \nThe WCRC installed the curb ramps along Old US-12 at its intersections with Wilkinson Street, \nLane Street, Arthur Street, and Taylor Street/Old Manchester Road.  Silver Maples is a retirement \ncommunity, built in 2002, that has independent and assisted living. The crosswalk on Silver \nMaples Drive (a private road) north of Old US-12 was put in by Silver Maples as part of its site \nplan development.  The City of Chelsea’s Planning Commission required that Silver Maples install \nsidewalks along Old US-12.  The WCRC did not construct the curb ramps at Silver Maples Drive.    \n-11- \n \n\n  As discussed below, and as outlined in the Court’s previous opinions in this case, the \nsidewalks and curb ramps at intersections must comply with certain federal regulations enacted \nunder the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act, known as the Americans with Disabilities Act \nAccessibility Guidelines for Buildings and Facilities (ADAAG), 28 C.F.R. Pt. 36, App. A, and the \nUniform Federal Accessibility Standards (UFAS), 41 C.F.R. Pt. 101-19.6, App. A, respectively.  \nThe construction specifications stated in MDOT Standard R-28-F were intended to achieve that \nend.  The MDOT special detail series R-28 are submitted for approval by the Federal Highway \nAdministration and review by the Department of Justice.  According to WCRC Senior Project \nManager Mark McCulloch, the edition used in 2007 was R-28-F, prepared by MDOT but not yet \napproved by the Federal authorities.  \n  The plaintiffs and Chelsea contend that the WCRC did not construct the curb ramps at issue \nin compliance with that standard.  The evidence of the curb ramps’ conditions came mostly from  \ninspections made during the pretrial discovery phase of the case, and other measurements taken \nshortly before trial.  The WCRC representatives were invited to participate in the inspections but \ndeclined.  There is no evidence that WCRC representatives took their own measurements as part \nof their trial preparation or otherwise.   \n  MDOT special detail R-28-F, applicable to the 2007 Old US-12 project, sets forth specific \ndesign and construction details for sidewalks, pedestrian ramps down to the curb, placement of \ndetectible warning, and slopes or grades through the curb and onto the gutter pan and across the \nstreet.  For straight line curb crossings, Section A-A applies; and for curb crossings along a radius, \nSection B-B applies. \n-12- \n \n\n  R-28-F Section A-A (straight line) applies to Wilkinson Street, Ramp No. 5, Lane Street, \nRamp No. 5, Arthur Street, Ramp No. 5, and Taylor Street Ramps 1 and 2.  R-28-F Section B-B \n(radius) applies to Wilkinson Street, Ramp 4, Lane Street, Ramps 2, 3 and 4, Arthur Street, ramps \n2, 3, and 4, Taylor Street ramps 2 and 3, and Old Manchester Road ramps 6 and 7.  R-28-F, Sections \nA-A and B-B, both require a continuation of a downward slope from the ‘expansion joint’ or ‘strip’ \nbetween the end the single section of concrete forming the ADA pedestrian ramp attached to the \ntraditional sidewalk and the beginning of the single section of concrete forming the curb and gutter \npan.  The slopes shown on R-28-F, where the curb joins out into the flow line of the gutter pan, \ncreates a trough-like low point, one half of the gutter sloping from the road toward the curb \nopening, and the other half sloping toward the road from the ramp into the receiving slope inside \nthe curb opening creating a subtle “V.”  This “V” should be located in front of and outside of the \ncurb line.  The purpose of this constant slope away from the ramp ensures the run of water down \nthe ramp over the pedestrian crossing at the curb and then away from the ramp.  These required \nslopes ensure that water running off the road pavement will not traverse beyond the flow line of \nthe gutter and pool back into the pedestrian’s curb opening.  The required slope inside the curb \nopening is a minimum of 2% toward the flowline of the gutter.   \n  R-28-F also calls for the placement of drains at various locations proximate to intersections \nfor the removal of standing (and flowing) water.  The WCRC did not install any drains along Old \nUS-12 during the 2007 reconstruction project because that task was not included in its funding or \nbid proposal.   \n  Christine  Linfield  testified  that  on  May  1,  2018,  Chelsea  representatives  took \nmeasurements of the portion of the curb cut base and the gutter pan along the pedestrian crossings \n-13- \n \n\nin the curb cuts slopes from the ramp out toward the street to the flowline of the gutter, as shown \nin R-28-F Sections A-A and B-B.  Measurements were taken at the center of the curb opening and \neither side at locations where a wheelchair would travel over the gutter.  Any dirt and debris present \nwere cleaned down to the bare concrete surface before measurements were taken.  A standard four-\ninch digital level was used to obtain precise readings of this area.  The level was properly \ncalibrated, and the resulting measurements were accurate and reliable.    \n  R-28-F, Section A-A, straight-line curb, requires a maximum grade of 8.3% from the \n“joint” to the “V” and to slope up towards the roadway from the flow line of the gutter adjacent at \na slope not to exceed 5.0% grade.  R-28-F, Section B-B, radius-line curb, requires a minimum \ngrade of 2% from the “joint” to the “V” of the gutter and then a slope toward the road not to exceed \n5.0% grade.  Each sheet of R-28-F includes a detail and reference to the note to slopes of 2% “in \nany direction.”  All gutter pans measured on May 1, 2018, save one, failed to comply with the \nslope requirements of R-28-F, Sections A-A and B-B.  Curb openings either sloped back toward \nthe ramp, were flat, or were otherwise under the minimum outward slope required by R-28-F.  \nBecause of the out-of-compliance condition, water could not travel beyond the base of the ramp \n“joint,” which marks the end of the sidewalk, and into the flow line of the curb to be drained away.  \nOnly the Northwest ramp at Taylor Street traveling South (Ramp No. 1) complied with the gutter \npan details of R-28-F, Section A-A.  \n  The out-of-compliance grade conditions, coupled with the failure to install drains as \nprescribed by MDOT special detail R-28-F, has caused the accumulation of standing water at the \nintersections and the deposition of debris on the curb ramps.  For instance, according to Christine \nLinefield, the entire curb length along Old US-12 was observed to be consistently filled with sand \n-14- \n \n\nduring the months of March, April, and May 2018.  Chelsea Department of Public Works \nSuperintendent Derik Bollinger testified that when the Northwest and Northeast ramps at Arthur \nStreet were inspected thirty days after being cleaned, the Northeast ramp had accumulated a \nsignificant amount of sand and dirt along the gutter in the curb opening during that time, while the \nNorthwest ramp was relatively clean.  That was due, he said, to Old US-12 running downhill from \nEast to West, causing the Northwest ramp to receive a larger amount of runoff from upstream than \nthe Northeast ramp.  On May 1, 2018, the Northeast ramp at Arthur Street was clogged with large \namounts of sand and dirt.  Chelsea workers had cleaned the ramp eleven days earlier, during the \nCity’s preliminary investigation of the gutter plan slope.  Bollinger testified that staining exposed \nupon removal of dirt and debris indicates that water and debris are traveling back into the ramp \nrather than out into the flow line of the gutter pan.  He said that such debris accumulation and \nstaining does not occur on curb ramps elsewhere within the City, such as those along M-52.  \n  According to Linefield and McCulloch, rainwater will not pool at the base of a curb ramp \nthat is constructed in accordance with MDOT R-28-F.  Rainwater from the roadway carries sand \nand debris from the Old US-12 roadway and then pools at the base of the ramps, causing deposits \nof sand and debris to accumulate in the gutter pan at the pedestrian crossings.  McCulloch observed \nwater pooling at the base of the Arthur Street ramp for at least six (6) hours.  He thought an \nobstruction on the adjoining city street was the culprit.  But when DPW Superintendent Bollinger \ninspected the location after a WCRC Engineer’s visit to the site, he found no obstruction on the \nconnecting city street.  \n  Bollinger also observed the Northwest and Northeast ramps at Arthur Street in late \nFebruary 2018 shortly after a rain event.  He said that the ramps pooled water and were clogged \n-15- \n \n\nwith a significant amount of sand, dirt and debris. Bollinger and Linefield visited the Northwest \nand Northeast ramps at Arthur Street in late March 2018 and took photographs, which depicted \nthe ramps prior to cleaning, after cleaning by a street sweeper, and after being manually cleaned.  \nBefore cleaning, the ramps were clogged with a significant amount of sand, dirt and debris at the \nbase of the ramp openings along the gutter pan.  Bollinger testified that these accumulations came \nfrom the sand thrown onto the roadway by WCRC during winter maintenance and washed down \nthe curb flow lines and into the ramps.  \n  The WCRC-constructed curb ramps collect water and frequently are filled with dirt, sand \nand debris.  Many of the installed gutter pans are graded back toward the ramp, causing the low \npoint of the gutter to fall behind the curb and fill with water.  R-28-F requires the gutter pan to \nslope away from the ramps, thereby allowing water to flow beyond the curb into the flow line of \nthe gutter where water will flow away from the ramp.  Water could not pond or deposit debris if a \nramp is built according to the applicable MDOT R-28-F standard. \n  Chelsea used an Elgin Whirlwind mechanical street sweeper that has a belly sweeper for \nthe road surface, and a gutter broom that pulls material into a suction nozzle to vacuum up and \nhaul away dirt and debris.  Bollinger testified that the street sweeper could not fully clean the \nNorthwest and Northeast ramps at Arthur Street.  He explained that the mechanical street sweeper \nis not designed to clean up and into curb ramp openings in the curb; it only sweeps along the gutter \npan.  The dirt and debris were so thick that the mechanical sweeper could not sweep and suction \nthe debris away in even two passes.  That condition was unusual and not replicated on any other \nramps  thorough  within  the  City.    After  being  cleaned  with  the  mechanical  sweeper,  City \n-16- \n \n\nmaintenance staff manually cleaned the ramps with a flat shovel and push broom. The debris was \npushed into the street where it could be reached by the mechanical sweeper and hauled away.  \n  The WCRC maintains that its construction of the curb ramps was fully compliant with R-\n28-F, and therefore with the ADAAG and the UFAS.  In support, it argues that the project had to \npass inspection for ADA compliance before any funds would be released to pay contractors and \nreimburse the County for constructions expenses.  And it contends that any out-of-compliance \nmeasurements found later, including the April and May 2018 measurements, were the result of \nsettling and shifting of the concrete curb ramps in relation to the asphalt road surface.   \n  The evidence does not support those arguments.   \n  First, there is no conclusive evidence that the ramps were constructed in accordance with \nthe R-28-F specifications.  The MDOT required form 1120, known as a “Final Inspection and \nAcceptance,” to be completed at the end of each MDOT-related project.  The WCRC did not \nsubmit a copy of the MDOT form 1120 for the 2007 Old US-12 project.  Sheryl Siddall, its Director \nof Engineering, explained that it had purged its records.  Nor did the WCRC produce any witness \nwho had knowledge of the contents, entries, completion, or filing of a form 1120 for this project.  \n  In  addition,  the  MDOT  required  “Inspector  Daily  Reports,”  known  as  IDRs,  to  be \ncompleted by the project inspector on a daily basis on MDOT form 1122B.  Ms. Siddall was \nfamiliar with IDRs; she confirmed that IDRs require the memorialization of only area calculations \nand materials used for payment purposes, not details as to ADA compliant construction.  Neither \nshe nor any other WCRC witness knew if ADA compliance details or inspections were actually \nwritten on the subject daily IRD forms.  The Project Inspector for the 2007 Old US-12 project was \nPaul Heinrich.  To confirm that the 2007 construction of the curb ramp slopes were completed \n-17- \n \n\ncorrectly, the WCRC inspector would have had to be on site at the time of the original pour of the \nconcrete, and would have had to measure the slopes as constructed.  Mr. Heinrich was the \ninspector, but there is no evidence that he actually made such measurements, or if he did, that he  \nnoted the measurements on the IDRs for each day and filed them at the WCRC main office.  Mr. \nHeinrich was retired at the time of trial, but he resided in Washtenaw County, Michigan, and was \nin occasional contact with WCRC personnel, including within six weeks before trial.  No party \nproduced Mr. Heinrich as a witness. The WCRC did not produce a witness that knew whether or \nnot ADA compliance measurements were included on any IDR.  No witness testified with personal \nknowledge that the 2007 curb ramps and gutters were ADA compliant at the time of installation.  \n  All municipal project files are subject to possible audit by the MDOT after the completion \nof a project.  However, neither the 2007 Old US-12 reconstruction project nor a similar WCRC \nroad improvement project in 2016 were audited.  Chelsea did not inspect the WCRC’s work.  It \ndid not receive an MDOT Form 1120 Final Inspection report.  The WCRC did not provide the City \nwith its IDRs or any other information of measurements of the curb ramps.  There is no direct \nevidence that the curb ramps were ADA-compliant when constructed.  And there is no evidentiary \nsupport for the WCRC’s circumstantial argument that payment would not have been approved if \nthe records had not demonstrated compliance.   \n  Second, there is no evidence to support the WCRC’s theory that pavement shifting over \ntime caused the out-of-compliance measurements found in 2017 and 2018.  For instance, the \nNorthwest and Northeast ramps at Arthur Street do not exhibit any signs of heaving, buckling, \ncracking, or settling in 2018.  All flags of concrete were flush, and joints between ramp, curb, and \ngutter pan were flush and even.   Shifting concrete is easily identifiable by visible cracking, \n-18- \n \n\ndistortion of joints, and changes in elevation resulting in uneven abutting slabs.  None were \nobserved at the curb ramps in the intersections at issue here.   \n  Moreover, as of May 2018, none of the ramps showed signs of deterioration.  All concrete \nslabs were level and abutting one to the other, and level with abutting curbs and abutting gutters \nin every instance.  The expansion joints between slabs, gutters and curbs were evenly spaced and \nuniform.    Bollinger testified that shifted concrete is easily identifiable by visible cracking, \ndistortion of joints, and changes in elevation resulting in uneven abutting slabs.  But there was no \nheaving, shifting, buckling, cracking or settling observed by any witness that would indicate that \nthe ramp slopes exist in a different state today than they did in 2007.  The City witnesses reasonably \ninferred that the condition of the ramps has not changed since 2007 and that the inter-curb slopes \nfound were those as the ramps had been constructed.  Mr. McCulloch of the WCRC could not \nrecall changes in elevation or uneven abutting slabs. He did not measure slopes on his April 2018 \ninspection of the one set of crossings he did look at.  \n  There has been no showing of an intervening cause that the several abutting, disconnected, \nseparately poured sections of flat and sloped concrete, curbs and gutters all settled, heaved, or \notherwise shifted simultaneously in identical proportion creating the illusion of solid original \nconstruction.  The WCRC did not present a witness having personal knowledge of the curb ramps \nhaving been in any different condition or having personal knowledge that the ramps were ADA-\ncompliant when installed. \n  Chelsea has not altered or otherwise manipulated the structure of the curb ramps installed \nby WCRC in 2007 under permit or otherwise.  \n-19- \n \n\n  It is more likely than not, therefore, that the WCRC failed to comply with the requirements \nof MDOT specification R-28-F when in 2007 it constructed the curb ramps at the intersection of \nOld US-12 and Wilkinson Street, the intersection of Old US-12 and Lane Street,  the intersection \nof Old US-12 and Arthur Street, and the intersection of Old US-12 and Taylor Street/Old \nManchester Road. \n  Finally, the WCRC has created an ongoing condition by throwing sand onto the roads and \ngutters along Old US-12 throughout the winter months.  The sand regularly washes along the \ngutters and into the ramps by rainwater and snow melt.  The WCRC does not sweep Old US-12 or \nremove the sand deposited by it.  Chelsea does not spread sand on its streets or on M-52, which it \nmaintains under contract with MDOT.  \nII.  Evidentiary Issues \n  The WCRC contests the admissibility of the Grawi and Clark depositions.  The plaintiffs \noffered those under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 32(a)(4)(B) (allowing use at trial when “the \nwitness is more than 100 miles from the place of hearing or trial or is outside the United States, \nunless it appears that the witness’s absence was procured by the party offering the deposition”) \nand Federal Rule of Evidence 804(b)(1) (former testimony of an unavailable witness).  Plaintiffs’ \ncounsel represented at trial that both witnesses were not in Michigan at the time of trial, and all \nparties had an opportunity to examine them at their discovery depositions.   \n  Counsel for the WCRC took Grawi’s deposition in another lawsuit after the trial proofs in \nthis case were concluded.  Grawi testified there that she moved to Florida in January 2018 and was \nno longer employed by AACIL.  She acknowledged that she returned to Michigan from time to \ntime for personal and business reasons.  However, she was not in the state in late May and early \n-20- \n \n\nJune 2018 when the trial in this case was held.  She testified, though, that plaintiffs’ counsel told \nher that she would not be required to return to Michigan for the adjourned trial date, since she did \nnot have other business in the state at the time.  She stated that coming to trial then might have \ncaused her difficulty if she could not get time off work, and she would have to bear the travel \nexpense.  Counsel for the WCRC then filed a motion to strike Grawi’s deposition testimony, but \nhe disregarded the requirement of E.D. Mich. LR 7.1(a), which requires that he confer with his \ncounterpart before filing such a motion.    \n  The refusal of WCRC counsel to make any effort to comply with the local rule is disturbing, \nbetrays a fundamental misunderstanding of the meet-and-confer requirement of LR 7.1, and would \njustify dismissal of the motion, even if it had merit.  It is apparent from the filings, however, that \nplaintiffs’ counsel did not “procure” Grawi’s absence from trial.  He had arranged for her to be \npresent for trial when it was originally scheduled for April 30, 2018.  At the final pretrial \nconference held on April 25, the Court adjourned the trial to May 29, 2018.  Plaintiffs’ counsel \nasserted in his response to the WCRC’s motion that he in fact told Grawi that she did not have to \nshow up at trial on April 30, because the trial had been adjourned.  Nor can it be said that plaintiffs’ \ncounsel engaged in willful misconduct or that he caused Grawi not to attend the trial in person.  \nShe moved to Florida on her own and was beyond the geographic subpoena authority of the Court.  \nSee Fed. R. Civ. P. 45(c)(1)(A) (authorizing a Court to issue a subpoena to command the \nappearance of a witness at trial “within 100 miles of where the person resides, is employed, or \nregularly transacts business in person”).  The essence of defense counsel’s accusation is that \nplaintiffs’ counsel apparently told Grawi (correctly) that she did not have to honor a subpoena that \nrequired her to appear for a trial being held more than 100 miles from where she then lived.  See \n-21- \n \n\nK.S. v. Detroit Pub. Sch., No. 14-12214, 2015 WL 6671560, at *1 (E.D. Mich. Nov. 2, 2015) \n(citing United States ex rel. Pogue v. Diabetes Treatment Centers of Am., Inc., 444 F.3d 462, 468 \n(6th Cir. 2006)).  No misconduct occurred by conveying that advice.  Rule 32(a)(4)(B) authorizes \nthe use of Grawi’s deposition at trial.  The WCRC’s motion to strike that testimony will be denied.   \n  Deborah Clark encountered similar circumstances.  She was prepared to testify in person \nat the April 30 trial.  However, she was committed to travel plans, which overlapped with the \nadjourned trial date on May 29.  She was 2,000 miles from the courthouse, and therefore was \nunavailable.  There is no evidence that Clark manipulated her travels to avoid appearing at trial, or \nthat her “absence was procured by the party offering the deposition.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 32(a)(4)(B).  \nHer testimony by deposition is allowed.   \n  The WCRC also objected to testimony and exhibits that pertained to measurements of the \ncurb ramps taken in early May 2018 shortly before trial.  The basis of the objection was that \nChelsea and the plaintiffs did not disclose that evidence under the pretrial disclosure requirement \nof Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(a)(1).  The Court granted the WCRC’s motion to exclude \nevidence of measurements taken on March 22, 2017, as they duplicated earlier measurements made \nin 2016.  However, as part of their trial preparation, representatives of Chelsea and the plaintiffs \nreturned to the scene and took measurements of different parts of the gutter pans and curb ramps \nat the subject intersections.  The attorneys for the WCRC were notified in advance, but they refused \nto participate.  The evidence was offered at trial through Derik Bollinger’s testimony on a separate \nrecord.   \n  Rule 26(a)(1) governs initial disclosures at the commencement of a lawsuit and requires \neach party, “without awaiting a discovery request,” to inform opposite parties “of each individual \n-22- \n \n\nlikely to have discoverable information — along with the subjects of that information — that the \ndisclosing party may use to support its claims or defenses”; furnish all documents “and tangible \nthings that the disclosing party has in its possession, custody, or control and may use to support its \nclaims or defenses”; and to disclose damages calculations and insurance information.  Fed. R. Civ. \nP. 26(a)(1)(A)(i)-)iv).  After a party makes its initial disclosures it has a continuing duty seasonably \nto supplement them “if the additional or corrective information has not otherwise been made \nknown to the other parties during the discovery process or in writing.”  Fed. R. Civ P. 26(e)(1)(A).   \n  It has been said that the purpose of Rule 26 is to prevent “trial by ambush,” permitting \nopposing counsel sufficient information to allow cross-examine with advance preparation. See \nMccaulay v. Anas, 321 F.3d 45, 50, 52 (1st Cir. 2003).  The initial disclosure requirements “are \ndesigned to accelerate the exchange of basic information and help focus the discovery that is \nneeded, and facilitate preparation for trial or settlement.”  Poitra v. Sch. Dist. No. 1 in the Cty. of \nDenver, 311 F.R.D. 659, 663 (D. Colo. 2015) (internal quotation marks, citations, and brackets \nomitted).  The rule was never intended, however, to inhibit a party’s ability for trial preparation.  \nIn fact, a separate section of Rule 26 actually limits discovery of trial preparation materials.  See \nFed. R. Civ P. 26(b)(3)(A) (“Ordinarily, a party may not discover documents and tangible things \nthat are prepared in anticipation of litigation or for trial by or for another party or its representative \n(including the other party’s attorney, consultant, surety, indemnitor, insurer, or agent”.).   \n  The information gathered during the scene visit of May 1, 2018 did not fall within any of \nthe Rule 26(a)(1)(A) categories, and the non-disclosure did not trigger any preclusion or other \nsanction found in Rule 37(c)(1).  The WCRC has not pointed to any other discovery demand that \nwould have required supplementation with the data gathered on May 1.  The measurement activity \n-23- \n \n\namounted to trial preparation, just like witness interviews and preparation of exhibits.  Closure of \nformal  discovery under a case management order entered under Rule 16 does not signal the end \nof additional investigation or evidence gathering in any case.   \n  There was no obligation here to share trial preparation material.  Nonetheless, the WCRC \nwas informed of the activity in advance and chose to ignore the opportunity, apparently relying on \nthe misguide notion that late-gathered information could be excluded from evidence.  But the \ndiscovery rules have never encouraged such a head-in-sand approach to litigation.  And the \nmeasurements of the curb ramps on a public street were there for all to see, even counsel for the \nWCRC, should he have chosen to bring his engineers to the site on May 1 or any other day.  There \nis no basis to exclude evidence of the measurements and curb ramp conditions observed on May \n1, 2018.   \nIII.  Conclusions of Law \nA.  Statutory Provisions \n1.  The ADA and its Regulations \n \n  Title II of the ADA prohibits the exclusion of a “qualified individual with a disability” \nfrom “participation in” or enjoying the “benefits of the services, programs, or activities of a public \nentity.”  42 U.S.C. § 12132.  It also prohibits “discrimination by any such entity.”  Ibid.   \n  A “qualified individual with a disability” within the meaning of the ADA is “an individual \nwith a disability who, with or without reasonable modifications to rules, policies, or practices, [or] \nthe removal of architectural . . .  barriers . . . meets the essential eligibility requirements for the \nreceipt of services or the participation in programs or activities provided by a public entity.”  42 \nU.S.C. § 12131(2).  All of the individual plaintiffs fit within this definition.  They all suffer from \na disability that affects their mobility, and they all sought — and continue to seek — to use the \n-24- \n \n\nsidewalk facilities within the City of Chelsea.  Curb ramps constructed to conform with the \nADAAG and UFAS amount to reasonable accommodations.   \n  “‘Public entity’ includes ‘any state or local government’ and ‘any department, agency, \nspecial purpose district, or other instrumentality of a State or States or local government.’”  Ability \nCenter of Greater Toledo v. City of Sandusky, 385 F.3d 901, 904 (6th Cir. 2004) (quoting 42 U.S.C. \n§ 12131(1)(A) & (B)).  The City of Chelsea and the Washtenaw County Road Commission are \n“public entities.”  \n  Through section 204 of the ADA, Congress granted to the Attorney General the “authority \nto promulgate regulations to implement its provisions.”  Ibid. (citing 42 U.S.C. § 12134).  One of \nthose regulations, 28 C.F.R. § 35.151, governs construction and alteration of public facilities \ncommenced after January 26, 1992.  When the alteration “could affect the usability of the facility,” \nthe alterations must be designed and constructed “in such manner that the altered portion of the \nfacility is readily accessible and usable by individuals with disabilities.’”  Ibid. (quoting 28 C.F.R. \n§ 35.151(b)).  The regulations define the term “facility” to include “all or any portion of buildings, \nstructures,  sites,  complexes,  equipment,  rolling  stock  or  other  conveyances,  roads,  walks, \npassageways, parking lots, or other real or personal property, including the site where the building, \nproperty, structure, or equipment is located.”  28 C.F.R. § 35.104.  The sidewalks and curb ramps \nalong the relevant portion of Old US-12 are “facilities” within the meaning of the regulations.   \n  As the Court explained in its previous opinion in this case, “‘To be “readily accessible,” \nany part of a newly constructed or altered facility must be constructed in conformance with the \nADAAG, 28 C.F.R. Pt. 36, App. A, or with the UFAS, 41 C.F.R. Pt. 101-19.6, App. A.’”  Mote v. \nCity of Chelsea, 252 F. Supp. 3d 642, 649 (E.D. Mich. 2017) (citing Daubert v. Lindsay Unified \n-25- \n \n\nSch. Dist., 760 F.3d 982, 986 (9th Cir. 2014); 28 C.F.R. § 35.151(c)(1)-(3)).  The ADAAG is a set \nof regulations that set out, in comprehensive detail, the design specifics for structures and facilities \nto make them “readily accessible” to disabled persons.  The regulations also require a public entity \nto “maintain in operable working condition those features of facilities and equipment that are \nrequired to be readily accessible to and usable by persons with disabilities by the Act or this part.”  \n28 C.F.R. § 35.133. \n  With  respect  to  curb  ramps,  section  35.151(i)  expressly  requires  that  “(1)  Newly \nconstructed or altered streets, roads, and highways must contain curb ramps or other sloped areas \nat any intersection having curbs or other barriers to entry from a street level pedestrian walkway,” \nand “(2) Newly constructed or altered street level pedestrian walkways must contain curb ramps \nor other sloped areas at intersections to streets, roads, or highways.”  28 C.F.R. § 35.151(i).  The \nDOJ has interpreted this regulation to require that “[w]hen streets, roads, or highways are newly \nbuilt or altered, they must have ramps or sloped areas wherever there are curbs or other barriers to \nentry from a sidewalk or path.  Likewise, when new sidewalks or paths are built or are altered, \nthey must contain curb ramps or sloped areas wherever they intersect with streets, roads, or \nhighways.”    U.S.  DOJ,  ADA  Title  II  Technical  Assistance  Manual  II-6.6000 \n(https://www.ada.gov/taman2.html). \n  The ADAAG sets forth detailed specifications for the location and construction of curb \nramps in Section 4.7 of the Guidelines (1991 version).  As an initial matter, the Guidelines define \nthe term “accessible route” as “[a] continuous unobstructed path connecting all accessible elements \nand spaces of a building or facility.”  ADAAG 3.4.  “Exterior accessible routes may include \nparking access aisles, curb ramps, crosswalks at vehicular ways, walks, ramps, and lifts.”  Ibid.  \n-26- \n \n\nThe phrase “curb ramp” refers to “[a] short ramp cutting through a curb or built up to it.”  Ibid.  “If \nan accessible route has changes in level greater than ½ in (13 mm), then a curb ramp . . . shall be \nprovided that complies with [ADAAG 4.7].”  ADAAG 4.3.8.  “Curb ramps complying with \n[ADAAG 4.7] shall be provided wherever an accessible route crosses a curb.”  ADAAG 4.7.1. \n  “Slopes of curb ramps shall comply with [ADAAG 4.8.2].”  ADAAG 4.7.2.  Section 4.8.2 \nspecifies that “[t]he least possible slope shall be used for any ramp,” “[t]he maximum slope of a \nramp in new construction shall be 1:12,” and “[t]he maximum rise for any run shall be 30 [inches].”  \nADAAG 4.8.2.  “Transitions from ramps to walks, gutters, or streets shall be flush and free of \nabrupt changes,” and “[m]aximum slopes of adjoining gutters, road surface immediately adjacent \nto the curb ramp, or accessible route shall not exceed 1:20.”  Ibid.  “The minimum width of a curb \nramp shall be 36 [inches], exclusive of flared sides.”  ADAAG 4.7.3.  “Surfaces of curb ramps \nshall comply with [section] 4.5.”  ADAAG 4.7.4.  Section 4.5 covers “ground and floor surfaces” \ngenerally and states, among other things, that (1) “[g]round and floor surfaces along accessible \nroutes and in accessible rooms and spaces including floors, walks, ramps, stairs, and curb ramps, \nshall be stable, firm, [and] slip-resistant”; (2) changes in level less than ¼” may be “vertical and \nwithout treatment”; and (3) changes between ¼ and ½” must be beveled and with a slope no greater \nthan 1:2.  ADAAG 4.5.1-4.5.2. \n  Curb ramps must “be located or protected to prevent their obstruction by parked vehicles,” \nand ramps “at marked crossings shall be wholly contained within the markings, excluding any \nflared sides.”  ADAAG 4.7.8-4.7.9.  “Outdoor ramps and their approaches shall be designed so \nthat water will not accumulate on walking surfaces.”  ADAAG 4.8.8. \n \n-27- \n \n\n2.  The Rehabilitation Act  \n  Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act parallels the command of the ADA concerning \naccessibility to public facilities for persons with disabilities, but it applies only to “any program or \nactivity receiving Federal financial assistance.’”  Babcock v. Michigan, 812 F.3d 531, 540 (6th \nCir. 2016) (quoting 29 U.S.C. § 794(a)).  “[T]he remedies, procedures, and rights available under \nTitle II of the ADA parallel those available under [The Rehabilitation Act].”  Ability Center, 385 \nF.3d at 905 & n.7 (citing 29 U.S.C. 794a(a)(2); Barnes v. Gorman, 536 U.S. 181, 189 n.3 (2002); \nJohnson v. City of Saline, 151 F.3d 564, 573 (6th Cir. 1998)).  Thus, the Sixth Circuit has explained \nthat its “analysis of Rehabilitation Act claims ‘roughly parallels’ ADA claims because the statutes \ncontain similar language and are ‘quite similar in purpose and scope.’”  Babcock, 812 F.3d at 540 \n(quoting McPherson v. Michigan High School Athletic Association, Inc., 119 F.3d 453, 459-60 \n(6th Cir. 1997)). \n   The regulations enacted under the Rehabilitation Act apply “to each recipient of Federal \nfinancial assistance from the Department of Transportation and to each program or activity that \nreceives such assistance,” and require that “all [] entities subject to section 504 shall design, \nconstruct, or alter buildings, or other fixed facilities, in conformance with appendices B and D of \n36 C.F.R. part 1191, as modified by appendix A to part 37 of this title.”  49 C.F.R. § 27.3.  “The \nRehabilitation Act has a set of standards nearly identical to the ADAAG called the Uniform \nFederal Accessibility Standards (‘UFAS’).  41 C.F.R. pt. 101-19.6, app. A.”  Greer v. Richardson \nIndep. Sch. Dist., 472 F. App’x 287, 291 n.2 (5th Cir. 2012).  The WCRC is subject to both the \nADAAG and the UFAS with respect to the 2007 renovation project for Old US-12.   \n \n-28- \n \n\n \n3.  State Law \n  The state law counterpart to these two federal statutory mandates is the Michigan Persons \nWith Disabilities Civil Rights Act (PWDCRA), Mich. Comp. Laws § 37.1101, et seq.  That \nenactment “‘substantially mirrors the ADA, and resolution of a plaintiff’s ADA claim will \ngenerally, though not always, resolve the plaintiff’s PWDCRA claim.’”  Donald v. Sybra, Inc., \n667 F.3d 757, 764 (6th Cir. 2012) (quoting Cotter v. Ajilon Servs., Inc., 287 F.3d 593, 597 (6th \nCir. 2002)). \nB.  Standing \n  The WCRC argues that the plaintiffs lack standing to pursue their claims for injunctive and \ndeclaratory relief because they have not suffered an injury in fact, and they have not shown that \nany accessibility deficit is fairly traceable to the WCRC.   \n  The requirement of standing comes from Article III’s limitation on the judicial power of \nfederal courts to adjudicate only actual cases and controversies.  It seeks to ensure the plaintiff has \na “personal stake in the outcome of the controversy” at the outset of litigation.  Baker v. Carr, 369 \nU.S. 186, 204 (1962).   \n  To establish standing, a plaintiff must show that he or she has suffered an “injury in fact,” \nthat was caused by the defendant’s conduct, and that a favorable decision will redress that injury.  \nKanuszewski v. Michigan Dep’t of Health & Human Servs., --- F.3d ---, No. 18-1896, 2019 WL \n2417390, at *2 (6th Cir. June 10, 2019) (citing Nikolao v. Lyon, 875 F.3d 310, 315-16 (6th Cir. \n2017); see also Susan B. Anthony List v. Driehaus, 573 U.S. 149, 157-58 (2014) (quoting Lujan v. \nDefs. of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560 (1992)).  The first requirement requires proof of “an injury in \n-29- \n \n\nfact, which is ‘concrete, particularized, and actual or imminent.’”  Id. art *3 (quoting Clapper v. \nAmnesty Int’l USA, 568 U.S. 398, 409 (2013)).  For a plaintiff seeking injunctive or declaratory \nrelief, the mere occurrence of past harm will not do.  City of Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95, \n106 (1983).  “When seeking declaratory and injunctive relief, a plaintiff must show actual present \nharm  or  a  significant possibility of  future  harm  in  order  to  demonstrate  the need  for  pre-\nenforcement review.”  National Rifle Ass'n of Am. v. Magaw, 132 F.3d 272, 279 (6th Cir. 1997).  \n“Past exposure to illegal conduct” will suffice to demonstrate an injury in fact that warrants \ndeclaratory or injunctive relief when the past injury is accompanied by “continuing, present \nadverse effects.”  Sullivan v. Benningfield, 920 F.3d 401, 407–08 (6th Cir. 2019) (quoting O’Shea \nv. Littleton, 414 U.S. 488, 495-96 (1974); Grendell v. Ohio Supreme Court, 252 F.3d 828, 832 (6th \nCir. 2001)). \n  The individual plaintiffs have satisfied these requirements.  They have described the \naccessibility barriers at the subject intersections caused by the standing water and accumulated \ndebris found regularly on the curb ramps.  Those conditions were persistent and caused by \nconstruction that did not comply with the ADAAG and UFAS.  The WCRC neither graded the \ncurb ramps properly nor installed the drainage recommended by MDOT specification R-28-F, \nnearly guaranteeing that water will accumulate whenever there is more than moderate rainfall.  \nThere is a significant possibility of future harm, which was caused by the faulty construction, and \nordering compliance likely will redress the injury.   \n  The question of AACIL’s standing was addressed in a prior opinion iled in this case.  See \nMote v. City of Chelsea, 284 F. Supp. 3d 863, 886-88 (E.D. Mich. 2018) (citing Havens Realty \nCorp. v. Coleman, 455 U.S. 363, 379 (1982) (holding that an advocacy organization for the \n-30- \n \n\nhomeless had standing to proceed against the defendants in a discrimination action, where its \ncomplaint  alleged  that  the  organization  had  been  “frustrated  by  defendants’  racial  steering \npractices in its efforts to assist equal access to housing through counseling and other referral \nservices,” and that the organization “had to devote significant resources to identify and counteract \nthe defendants’ racially discriminatory steering practices”)).   \nC.  Failure of Compliance \n  The command of the governing statutes in this case is clear: public entities must construct \ntheir facilities so that “no qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of such disability, \nbe excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities \nof a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by such entity.” 42 U.S.C. § 12132.  Moreover, \n“[n]o otherwise qualified individual with a disability . . . shall, solely by reason of his or her \ndisability,  be  excluded  from  participation  in,  be  denied  the  benefits  of  or  be  subjected  to \ndiscrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.” 29 U.S.C. \n§794(a).  Because the improvements to Old US-12 occurred after 1996, the WCRC was required \nto design and construct the curb ramps so that they would be “‘readily accessible and usable by \nindividuals with disabilities.’”   Ability Center of Greater Toledo, 385 F.3d at 904 (quoting 28 \nC.F.R. § 35.151(b)).  Michigan’s PWDCRA contains similar requirements.   \n  The regulations, discussed above, prescribe detailed specifications to ensure proper grades \nand slopes that strike a balance between ease of use by wheelchair-bound individuals and the \nproper flow of water to allow adequate drainage.  Curb ramps must be designed and constructed \nto prevent the accumulation of water.  ADAAG 4.6.1, 45.10.  The plaintiffs have shown by a \npreponderance of the evidence that the WCRC’s construction of nearly all of the curb ramps at the \n-31- \n \n\nintersection of Old US-12 and Wilkinson Street, the intersection of Old US-12 and Lane Street, \nthe intersection of Old US-12 and Arthur Street, and the intersection of Old US-12 and Taylor \nStreet/Old Manchester Road failed to comply with those regulations.   \n  The testimony established that the curb ramps are constructed of several separately-poured \nconcrete components.  The concrete curb and gutter is poured first and allowed to cure for three  \ndays.  The ramp is then built upward from the curb to the  sidewalk, and the sidewalk is built from \nthere onward.  According to both Mr. Bollinger and Mr. McCulloch, the gutter pan and curb can \nbe removed independently and re-poured to cure defects in design and installation.  Bollinger \ntestified that this procedure actually has been done by the WCRC on at least one occasion.   \n  Whether that approach will be sufficient to cause compliance in this case is not clear from \nthe record.  The MDOT specification R-28-F calls for the placement of drains proximate to the \ncurb ramps to allow for proper drainage.  There is insufficient evidence in this record to conclude \nthat drain placement is necessary to bring the curb ramps into compliance with the ADAAG and \nUFAS.  WCRC engineer Mark McCulloch explained that adding drains would increase costs and \nwas not in the scope of the project.  However, for renovations constructed after 1992, “the \nregulations require compliance with specific architectural accessibility standards.”  Tennessee v. \nLane, 541 U.S. 509, 532 (2004).  Cost certainly is a valid consideration when a public entity is \nconsidering an improvement to a facility, but once a decision is made to pursue the project, it is \nnot a defense to violation of the ADA.  See 28 C.F.R. 35.151(b); Kinney v Yerusalim, 9 F.3d 1067, \n1074-75  (3rd Cir.  2003)  (holding  that  “once  the  City  undertakes  to  resurface  a  street,  the \naccompanying curbs are no longer to be considered as existing facilities, subject to the ‘undue \nburden’ defense of § 35.150(a)(3)”).  \n-32- \n \n\n  The WCRC must rework the offending curb ramps to improve drainage and to eliminate \nthe incidence of standing water and the deposits of debris on the curb ramps.  If replacing the curb \nramps solves the problem, compliance likely would be achieved.  If not, then installation of \nadditional drainage may be required.    \n  Some of the plaintiffs also complained about the conditions of the curb ramps at Silver \nMaples Drive and Old US-12.  The WCRC did not construct those curb ramps and has no liability \nfor their conditions.  Chelsea was responsible for the construction of the ramps at that intersection, \nbut the plaintiffs have offered no evidence that the ramps do not comply with the ADAAG or the \nUFAS.  They only offer anecdotal evidence of the conditions of the curb ramps following a heavy \nrain.  And they submitted a photograph in evidence showing a pothole in the intersection, which \nChelsea says was repaired by trial time.  They have not sustained their burden against either \ndefendant as to that intersection for prospective relief.   \n  Finally, the plaintiffs argue that Chelsea is liable for the defectively-constructed curb ramps \nalong Old US-12 because it issues permits for work the WCRC performed in the City’s right-of-\nway.  It is true that the ADA regulations impose obligations on a public entity to ensure that \naccessibility features are incorporated and that the ADAAG specifications are complied with any \ntime that a public facility is altered or newly constructed, after 1992, A>by, on behalf of, or for the \nuse of a public entity in a manner that affects or could affect the usability of the facility or part of \nthe facility=@  Ability Center, 385 F.3d at 904 (quoting 28 C.F.R. ' 35.151(b)) (emphasis added).  \nThe “project log” and the letter regarding the permit process suggest that the City was involved at \nthe very least in issuing required permits to allow the project to proceed.  However, Chelsea had \nno inspection obligation concerning the project, and the WCRC never furnished Chelsea with any \n-33- \n \n\nof its IDRs or the Form 1120 Final Inspection Report.  The plaintiffs have not sustained their \nburden of proving that Chelsea is jointly liable with the WCRC for any resulting ADA defects in \nthe sidewalks and curb ramps. \nD.  Construction Versus Maintenance \n  Chelsea and the WCRC point fingers at each other, alleging fault for the inaccessible \nconditions of the curb ramps along the stretch of Old US-12 altered during the 2007 resurfacing \nproject.  Citing a state law that assigns to the City the responsibility of maintaining sidewalks \nwithin its borders, Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. § 691.1402a(1) (“A municipal corporation in which a \nsidewalk is installed adjacent to a municipal, county, or state highway shall maintain the sidewalk \nin reasonable repair.”), the WCRC argues that the water accumulation and debris collection is \npurely a maintenance issue.  Chelsea says that the water and debris collect on the ramps precisely \nbecause of the faulty construction, and no maintenance will cure the problem long-term.  The \nplaintiffs have reached a settlement with the City of Chelsea over the conditions of other sidewalks, \ncurb ramps, and parking facilities within the City; but the plaintiffs argue that the defendants \nshould be jointly liable under the ADA, the Rehabilitation Act, and state law for the curb ramps \nalong Old US-12.   \n  The pertinent provision of the ADAAG and other regulations governing curb ramps states \nsimply that “[s]urfaces of curb ramps shall comply with 4.5.”  ADAAG § 4.7.4.  As noted above, \nSection 4.5 covers ground and “floor surfaces,” and generally requires that “curb ramps[] shall be \nstable, firm, [and] slip-resistant.”.  ADAAG § 4.5.1.  It also includes design specifications.  Id. § \n4.5.2.  There are other pertinent regulations, but they speak to design and construction, not \nmaintenance.  E.g., Id. § 4.8.8 (“Outdoor ramps and their approaches shall be designed so that \n-34- \n \n\nwater will not accumulate on walking surfaces.”).  The regulations do not refer to maintenance \nspecifically.   \n  Certainly, though, if a surface was constructed to be “slip-resistant,” but the presence of \ndebris defeats the slip-resistant construction features, which could be restored if the debris were \nremoved, an obligation to maintain accessibility might be triggered.  However, no amount of \ncleaning, or even water and debris removing, can make a ramp compliant with the guideline that \nrequires it to not accumulate water in the first instance.  Therefore, there also is a separate \nobligation to fix the ramp so there is no accumulation.  No amount of maintenance can cure the \nunderlying compliance violation, where the ramps were out of compliance as built initially, and \nno amount of “sweeping up” can restore them to compliance with respect to the basic construction \ndefect.  Any maintenance lapse does not absolve the WCRC of its primary liability.   \n  The plaintiffs have not cited any regulations under any of the applicable statutes that might \naddress an obligation to remove debris left behind after the standing water evaporates.  The cases \non point hold generally that a merely temporary accumulation of debris on a surface is not an ADA \nviolation,  even  if  accessibility  is  impaired.    There  is  no  clear  definition  of  a  “temporary” \nobstruction, and the cases are fact-specific.  \n  It is generally acknowledged that “[a] sidewalk is a ‘facility,’ and sidewalks built or altered \nafter January 26, 1992, must be ‘readily accessible to and useable’ by people with disabilities.”  \nStraw v. Village of Streamwood, 734 F. App’x 344, 347 (7th Cir. 2018), reh’g denied (June 5, \n2018) (quoting 28 C.F.R. §§ 35.104, 35.151).  The responsible public entity “must maintain \n[accessibility  features]  in  operative  condition,  it  must  repair  [them]  promptly  [if  they] \nmalfunction[], and it must take reasonable steps to accommodate an individual who otherwise \n-35- \n \n\nwould have used the [features] when [they] are out of order.”   Foley v. City of Lafayette, 359 F.3d \n925, 929 (7th Cir. 2004).  “But the [regulations under the ADA and Rehabilitation Act do] not \nsubject [municipalities] to liability for isolated or temporary interruptions in service due to \nrepairs.”  Ibid.   \n  “[T]here are no universal definitions in the regulations for what is required to ‘maintain in \noperative condition’ the accessibility features, to repair ‘promptly’ such features, or to take \n‘reasonable  steps’  to  accommodate  when  the  features  are  not  accessible.  The  extent  of \ninaccessibility covered by the terms ‘isolated or temporary’ . . . is likewise unclear and only \ndeterminable by considering the unique circumstances of the case.”  Ibid.  In Foley, the court held \nthat a merely temporary accumulation of debris such as dirt, ice, or snow is not sufficient to trigger \nliability under the ADA or Rehabilitation Act, even where the responsible entity was notified of a \nproblem that impaired accessiblity and had ample time to act.  Foley, 359 F.3d at 930 (“[E]ven \nassuming, as we must, that the ramp was impassable, that . . . was a temporary condition. The \nsnowfall covered the sizeable exterior area of Riehle Plaza for which Taylor was responsible for \nsnow removal. That Taylor had four-and-a-half hours notice that Robert was arriving but had not \nyet cleared the ramp by the time Robert’s train arrived does not vitiate the temporary nature of the \nsnow obstruction of the alternative accommodation — and the ADA was not violated.”).  But if \nthe record shows that there was “frequent denial of access to disabled persons or a policy that \nneglects [accessibility feature] maintenance,” where the responsible entity makes no attempt to \noffer reasonable accommodations to disabled users during periods of inaccessibility, then the \ndefendant may be liable for neglect of its maintenance obligation.  Id. at 929. \n-36- \n \n\n  In this case, the undisputed facts establish that Chelsea does not spread sand on its own \nstreets, nor does it maintain Old-US-12 as it does not receive any funding for such activity, and \ndoes not have a maintenance contract with the WCRC.   Chelsea’s Department of Public Works \nmaintenance procedures provide that after a complaint is received by the City offices, a work order \nis produced and maintenance staff address the complaint.  No party has contradicted Chelsea’s \nassertion that it had never received any complaint about the curb ramps at issue until this lawsuit \nwas filed.  Therefore, the plaintiffs have not carried their burden of showing that Chelsea \n“frequent[ly] deni[ed] access to disabled persons” or that it maintained “a policy that neglects \nmaintenance” of the curb ramps to make them accessible to persons with disabilities.   \nIV. Conclusion \n  The plaintiffs have standing to proceed with their claims for prospective relief against the \ndefendants under the Americans With Disabilities Act, the Rehabilitation Act, and Michigan’s \nPersons With Disabilities Civil Rights Act.  The deposition testimony offered by the plaintiffs at \ntrial is properly received in evidence. The evidence of the gutter pan and curb ramp measurements \ntaken in May 2018 are properly received in evidence.  The Washtenaw County Road Commission \nfailed to construct the gutter pans and curb ramps in compliance with applicable regulations and \nspecifications  promulgated  under  the  ADA  and  the  Rehabilitation  Act  at  the  following \nintersections of Chelsea city streets with Old US-12: two (2) at Wilkinson Street, four (4) at Lane \nStreet, four (4) at Arthur Street, and six (6) at Taylor Street/Old Manchester Road.  The City of \nChelsea is not liable for the conditions of the intersection crosswalks (including curb ramps) along \nOld US-12 within its city limits.   \n-37- \n \n\n  For the reasons stated, the Court will enter judgment for injunctive and declaratory relief \nin favor of the plaintiffs and against defendant Washtenaw County Road Commission on Counts \nI and II of the second amended complaint.  The Court will enter judgment in favor of defendants \nCity of Chelsea and the Chelsea Downtown Development Authority and against the plaintiffs on \nCounts I, II, and III of the second amended complaint.  Except as to the claims addressed by the \nconsent judgment entered between the plaintiffs and the City of Chelsea and its Downtown \nDevelopment Authority, the second amended complaint will be dismissed with prejudice as to \ndefendants City of Chelsea and the Chelsea Downtown Development Authority.  The third-party \ncomplaint seeking indemnity from the Washtenaw County Road Commission for any liability \nimposed upon defendant City of Chelsea for violations of the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act will \nbe dismissed as moot. \n \n    s/David M.

The plaintiffs — Shauna Mote and several other\ndisabled individuals, joined by the Ann Arbor Center for Independent Living — filed this lawsuit\nunder the Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA) alleging that the City of Chelsea and its\n\nDowntown Development Authority (DDA), along with the Michigan Department of Transportation\n(MDOT), have created or facilitated violations of the ADA within certain public pedestrian areas\nin the City by allowing businesses to renovate storefronts without including appropriate accessibility\nmeasures, and by removing previously constructed physical accommodations for wheelchair users,\nsuch as curb ramps at some intersections.  \nThe plaintiffs initially sued the public entities they believed have jurisdiction over the\nfacilities in question.  Chelsea obtained leave to file a third-party complaint against the Washtenaw\nCounty Road Commission (WCRC), alleging that the responsibility for regulating and maintaining\none of the main roadways through the City (“Old U.S. Highway 12”), which is the locale of certain\nalleged accessibility defects described in the complaint, rests entirely with that agency and is beyond\nthe purview of the City or its zoning authorities.  In the meantime, the plaintiffs and Chelsea and its\nDDA have reached a settlement, which they have presented as a proposed consent decree.  The\nMDOT takes no position on that request, but the WCRC opposes it.  \nPresently before the Court are motions (1) for judgment on the pleadings by defendant\nMDOT; (2) for judgment on the pleadings by third-party defendant WCRC; (3) for entry of a\nconsent decree filed jointly by the plaintiffs and defendants City of Chelsea; and (4) for leave to file\na second amended complaint by the plaintiffs that would add the WCRC as a principal defendant\nand elaborate claims directly against that entity premised on the same facts alleged in the original\ncomplaint concerning certain roadways within the City of Chelsea.  The Court heard argument on\nJanuary 5, 2017.  The pleadings state plausible claims against all of the public entities under Title\nII of the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.  Bringing the WCRC into the dispute as a main\ndefendant clarifies the issues, properly aligns the parties, and will not prejudice anyone.  There is\n-2-\n\nno good reason not to allow the settlement between Chelsea and the plaintiffs.  Therefore, the Court\nwill deny the motions for judgment on the pleadings, grant the motion to approve the settlement, and\ngrant the plaintiffs’ motion to file a second amended complaint.  Because of the delay in ruling on\nthese motions, the Court will entertain the parties’ proposals to adjust the present scheduling order. \nI.\nAccording to the first amended complaint, the individual plaintiffs are disabled persons, who\nlive, work, or frequently travel to and within the City of Chelsea, Michigan, and who each require\nthe use of a wheelchair, braces, cane, or other assistive devices in order to get around.  Plaintiff Ann\nArbor Center for Independent Living is an association that represents disabled persons such as the\nplaintiffs throughout southeastern Michigan, including in Chelsea.  Together, and on behalf of\npersons similarly situated, the individual and association plaintiffs complain that the public streets\nand sidewalks in the City of Chelsea recently have become less than fully accessible to them due\nto City approvals of renovations by private businesses adjacent to public sidewalks and streets\nmaking those facilities inaccessible, and because of construction and renovation work done on\npublic sidewalks and streets by the City of Chelsea, the WCRC, and MDOT, which either removed\nor omitted accessibility features.  In particular, the plaintiffs claim that the City has allowed\nbusinesses to renovate their storefronts by installing new steps that create barriers to access for\nwheelchair users, where ramps previously allowed them to enter those businesses, and that the City\n(or other defendant agencies) have removed existing ramps and curb cuts and replaced them with\ngrass or solid curbs at certain intersections.  \n-3-\n\nThe plaintiffs assert that all of the accessibility defects of which they complain are located\nwithin the City of Chelsea, and that many of the alleged violations concern the public streets and\nsidewalks along Michigan State Route 52 (which, within the City limits, is also known as “Main\nStreet” and is the principal auto and pedestrian route through the city center).  They charge that the\nalleged “defective construction and alterations, combined with insufficient maintenance and\nenforcement — have continuously failed to ensure that [the defendants’] sidewalks, street crossings,\nstreet level transit stops, and certain other facilities, services, programs and activities are readily\nusable by and accessible to Plaintiffs and others.”  \nPlaintiff Deborah Clark uses a wheelchair and the aid of a service dog.  She recently moved\nto Chelsea and discovered that she could not safely access the City’s sidewalks, street crossings, and\nmunicipal parking.  Also, she found that many downtown businesses lack an accessible entrance,\nand even the public library is inaccessible to her.  She also cannot safely use many sidewalks and\nstreet crossings due to accessibility barriers.  \nPlaintiff Shauna Mote recently tried to use the City’s new Jackson Street parking lot, which\nwas built in 2014, but she was unable to do so because the driveway and walkways connecting the\nlot to Middle Street are too steep for her safely to traverse.  \nPlaintiffs Carlos Gray-Lion and Karen and Merlyn Street recently learned that the City\nremoved long existing curb cuts that they had used on Congdon Street and Wilkinson street, and\nreplaced them with inaccessible grassy areas or solid curbs.  \nEach year the City and its DDA sponsor several festivals and parades.  The individual\nplaintiffs all have been unable to attend or fully participate in these events due to the lack of\naccessible public parking, as well as mobility barriers on City sidewalks and streets.   \n-4-\n\nThe MDOT has principal responsibility for maintaining the M-52 roadway, including the\nportion that comprises Main Street in the City, but it permits the City to do certain work on adjacent\nsidewalks and curbs.  At various times after January 16, 1992 (the effective date of the applicable\nversion of the ADA Accessibility Guidelines), MDOT has performed maintenance and new\nconstruction in the M-52 corridor, including re-paving the roadway from curb line to curb line and\nconstructing or repairing sidewalks and curbs.  Despite these renovations and new construction\nprojects, MDOT has left in place a number of inaccessible curbs at pedestrian crosswalks.  MDOT\nalso has permitted the City to construct or alter adjacent sidewalks and curbs along Main Street,\nwhich suffer similar accessibility defects.  MDOT also allows on-street parking along Main Street,\nand has striped parking spaces for that purpose.  According to the first amended complaint, none of\nthat parking is ADA-compliant because it is obstructed by, among other things, excessive slopes or\nobstructive lips between the street and sidewalks, as well as holes and other defects in the pavement\nor curb ramps.  \nIn 2015 the City re-paved Congdon street and, in the process, removed two curb cuts at the\npedestrian cross-walk at the intersection with Lincoln Avenue.  The City also stopped its resurfacing\nproject just short of an intersection with Middle Street, in order to avoid doing work that would have\nrequired the City to install curb cuts at cross-walks there.  \nAlso in 2015, MDOT awarded the City a “Safe Route to Schools” grant (which included\nfederal funds) to improve accessibility and safety in several public pedestrian corridors within the\nCity.  However, in addition to using those funds to build new cross-walks and signals, and to create\nsome accessible curb ramps, the City also spent some of the money to remove other, long-existing\ncurb cuts and ramps, replacing them with inaccessible features.  \n-5-\n\nIn 2014 the City constructed and opened its Jackson Street parking lot, which included a\ndriveway and walkway connecting the public parking areas to the street.  The parking facility,\nhowever, is inaccessible due to extreme slopes in the driveway and walkway.  \nFinally, since 1992, the City has maintained a number of public municipal parking lots and\nspaces for on-street parking along various city streets.  The City has added or altered many of those\nmunicipal parking lots and on-street parking spaces that include spots designated as parking for\nwheelchair users.  However, all of the designated spaces are inaccessible for various reasons,\nincluding excessive slopes, insufficient width per the ADA guidelines, and lack of adequate or level\nspace to deploy a vehicle wheelchair ramp. \nIn its third-party complaint, the City alleges that it is bisected by two main roadways that are\nnot fully under its control and regulation.  As previously noted, one of the streets is M-52 (“Main\nStreet”), which the City contends is maintained and regulated by MDOT.  The City alleges that the\nother major bisecting roadway is County Road Old U.S. 12, which is subject to the exclusive\njurisdiction and control of the WCRC.  The City admits that it constructed two pedestrian crossings\non Old U.S. 12 since 1992, and it asserts that it did so with a permit from the County.  But the City\ncontends that, to the extent that the plaintiffs complain of any other defects involving sidewalks or\npedestrian cross-walks along the Old U.S. 12 corridor, any declaratory or injunctive relief obtained\nmust be directed to the WCRC, because it has — and has exercised — exclusive control over the\nconditions and construction of the street, sidewalks, curbs, and crossings along that route.\nThe plaintiffs’ initial putative class-action complaint and related responses and orders were\nstruck because those documents improperly included the full name of an individual plaintiff who\nis a minor.  The plaintiffs subsequently re-filed a corrected amended complaint naming that\n-6-\n\nindividual only by his initials.  The amended complaint alleges violations of ADA Title II (Count\nI) and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Count II) against the City of Chelsea, the City’s Downtown\nDevelopment Authority, and MDOT.  The complaint also raises a congruent claim against the City\nof Chelsea only under Michigan’s Persons With Disabilities Civil Rights Act (PWDCRA).  The City\nof Chelsea sought leave to file a third-party complaint against the WCRC, which the City contends\nhas exclusive control over and responsibility for certain roadways within its city limits.  Defendant\nMDOT filed an answer to the original complaint and a motion for judgment on the pleadings;\nWCRC responded in similar fashion to the third-party complaint.  The plaintiffs later filed a joint\nmotion for entry of consent decree with the concurrence of the City of Chelsea, and a motion for\nleave to file a second amended complaint to name WCRC as a principal defendant. \nII.\nA motion for judgment on the pleadings under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(c) applies\nthe same standards that govern motions to dismiss filed under Rule 12(b)(6).  See Fed. R. Civ. P.\n12(c); Vickers v. Fairfield Med. Ctr., 453 F.3d 757, 761 (6th Cir. 2006); Ziegler v. IBP Hog Mkt.,\nInc., 249 F.3d 509, 511-12 (6th Cir. 2001).  The standards are well known to the parties: the purpose\nof the motion is to allow a defendant to test whether, as a matter of law, the plaintiff is entitled to\nlegal relief if all the facts and allegations in the complaint are taken as true.” Rippy ex rel. Rippy v.\nHattaway, 270 F.3d 416, 419 (6th Cir. 2001) (citing Mayer v. Mylod, 988 F.2d 635, 638 (6th Cir.\n1993)).  The complaint is viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, the allegations in the\ncomplaint are accepted as true, and all reasonable inferences are drawn in favor of the plaintiff. \nBassett v. Nat’l Collegiate Athletic Ass’n, 528 F.3d 426, 430 (6th Cir. 2008).  To survive the motion,\nthe plaintiffs “must plead ‘enough factual matter’ that, when taken as true, ‘state[s] a claim to relief\n-7-\n\nthat is plausible on its face.’  Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 556, 570 (2007).  Plausibility\nrequires showing more than the ‘sheer possibility’ of relief but less than a ‘probab[le]’ entitlement\nto relief.  Ashcroft v. Iqbal, [556 U.S. 662, 678] (2009).”  Fabian v. Fulmer Helmets, Inc., 628 F.3d\n278, 280 (6th Cir. 2010).  \nAt this stage of the case, the Court must accept as true the pleaded facts, but not factual\nconclusions unless they are plausibly supported by the pleaded facts.  “[B]are assertions,” such as\nthose that “amount to nothing more than a ‘formulaic recitation of the elements’” of a claim, can\nprovide context to the factual allegations, but are insufficient to state a claim for relief and must be\ndisregarded.  Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 681 (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555).  However, as long as a\ncourt can “‘draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged,’\na plaintiff’s claims must survive a motion to dismiss.”  Fabian, 628 F.3d at 281 (quoting Iqbal, 556\nU.S. at 678).\nA.\nUnder Title II of the ADA, “no qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of such\ndisability, be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services, programs, or\nactivities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any such entity.”   42 U.S.C. §\n12132.  “‘Public entity’ includes ‘any state or local government’ and ‘any department, agency,\nspecial purpose district, or other instrumentality of a State or States or local government.’”  Ability\nCenter of Greater Toledo v. City of Sandusky, 385 F.3d 901, 904 (6th Cir. 2004) (quoting 42 U.S.C.\n§ 12131(1)(A) & (B)).  “[Section 204 of the] Act grants the Attorney General authority to\npromulgate regulations to implement its provisions.”  Ibid. (citing 42 U.S.C. § 12134).  “Pursuant\nto § 204, the Attorney General adopted 28 C.F.R. § 35.151, which provides that alterations of\n-8-\n\nfacilities commenced after January 26, 1992, ‘by, on behalf of, or for the use of a public entity in\na manner that affects or could affect the usability of the facility or part of the facility shall, to the\nmaximum extent feasible, be altered in such manner that the altered portion of the facility is readily\naccessible and usable by individuals with disabilities.’”  Ibid. (quoting 28 C.F.R. § 35.151(b)).  The\nterm “facility” is defined under the applicable ADA regulations to include “all or any portion of\nbuildings, structures, sites, complexes, equipment, rolling stock or other conveyances, roads, walks,\npassageways, parking lots, or other real or personal property, including the site where the building,\nproperty, structure, or equipment is located.”  28 C.F.R. § 35.104.\n“To be ‘readily accessible,’ any part of a newly constructed or altered facility must be\nconstructed in conformance with the Americans with Disabilities Act Accessibility Guidelines for\nBuildings and Facilities (ADAAG), 28 C.F.R. Pt. 36, App. A, or with the Uniform Federal\nAccessibility Standards (UFAS), 41 C.F.R. Pt. 101-19.6, App. A.”  Daubert v. Lindsay Unified Sch.\nDist., 760 F.3d 982, 986 (9th Cir. 2014) (citing 28 C.F.R. § 35.151(c)(1)-(3)).  “The ADAAG is a\ncomprehensive  set  of  structural  guidelines  that  articulates  detailed  design  requirements  to\naccommodate persons with disabilities.”  Ibid.  “Section 35.151 is part of a broader regulatory\nscheme that aims to effectuate § 202 of the ADA.”  Ability Center, 385 F.3d at 904.  “The scheme\nmakes explicit that ‘no qualified individual with a disability shall, because a public entity’s facilities\nare inaccessible to or unusable by individuals with disabilities, be excluded from participation in,\nor be denied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities of a public entity, or be subjected\nto discrimination by any public entity.’”  Ibid. (quoting 28 C.F.R. § 35.149).  \nSection 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 states that “[n]o otherwise qualified individual\nwith a disability . . . shall, solely by reason of her or his disability, be excluded from the participation\n-9-\n\nin, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity\nreceiving Federal financial assistance.”  29 U.S.C. § 794(a).  “[T]he remedies, procedures, and rights\navailable under Title II of the ADA parallel those available under [The Rehabilitation Act].”  Ability\nCenter, 385 F.3d at 905 & n.7 (citing 29 U.S.C. 794a(a)(2); Barnes v. Gorman, 536 U.S. 181, 189\nn.3 (2002); Johnson v. City of Saline, 151 F.3d 564, 573 (6th Cir. 1998)).  Thus, the Sixth Circuit\nhas explained that its “analysis of Rehabilitation Act claims ‘roughly parallels’ ADA claims because\nthe statutes contain similar language and are ‘quite similar in purpose and scope.’”  Babcock, 812\nF.3d at 540 (quoting McPherson v. Michigan High School Athletic Association, Inc., 119 F.3d 453,\n459-60 (6th Cir. 1997)).\nThe  same  can  be  said  of  the  Michigan  Persons  With  Disabilities  Civil  Rights  Act\n(PWDCRA).  It “‘substantially mirrors the ADA, and resolution of a plaintiff’s ADA claim will\ngenerally, though not always, resolve the plaintiff’s PWDCRA claim.’”  Donald v. Sybra, Inc., 667\nF.3d 757, 764 (6th Cir. 2012) (quoting Cotter v. Ajilon Servs., Inc., 287 F.3d 593, 597 (6th Cir.\n2002)).\nThe motions by MDOC and WCRC are based primarily on their reading of Babcock v.\nMichigan, 812 F.3d 531 (6th Cir. 2016).  That case concerned the accessibility by disabled people\nto Cadillac Place, the former General Motors Corporation world headquarters building that the State\nof Michigan acquired to be used as offices for several state agencies.  The building, designed by the\nrenowned architect Albert Kahn, was constructed between 1919 and 1923.  The plaintiff in that case\nwas an employee of one of the state agencies, and she alleged that certain design features of the\nbuilding violated Title II of the ADA because they denied her access to her place of employment. \nId. at 533.  The court held that the plaintiff failed to state a claim under the ADA, because she\n-10-\n\n“failed to identify any ‘services, programs, or activities’ of a public entity from which she was\nexcluded or denied a benefit.”  Ibid.  Distinguishing “between services, programs, or activities and\nthe facilities in which they are administered,” the court reasoned that the ADA does not protect mere\naccess to pubic buildings; instead, “Title II’s private right of action is specifically intended to\nremedy interference with a disabled individual’s participation in, or benefitting from, a public\nservice, program, or activity” conducted within a public building.  Id. at 535 (citing San Francisco\nv. Sheehan, ---U.S. ---, 135 S. Ct. 1765, 1773 (2015)).  The court concluded that “facility\naccessibility is not, standing alone, a cognizable claim under Title II’s private right of action; rather,\nthe inquiry is tied to whether that facility’s inaccessibility interferes with access to public services,\nprograms, or activities.”  Id. at 536.  \nExtrapolating from this holding, defendant MDOC and third-party defendant WCRC argue\nthat (1) in order to raise a viable claim against a public entity under Title II of the ADA, a plaintiff\nmust allege not only that a “facility” is inaccessible, but also that, as a consequence of the alleged\ninaccessibility, he or she was denied the full benefit of some “service” provided by the defendants,\n(2) sidewalks, parking spaces, and roadways are “facilities” and not “services,” and the complaint\nalleges nothing more than that certain sidewalks, roadways, and parking areas within the city limits\ndo not conform with applicable ADA Accessibility Guidelines, and (3) therefore, because the\ncomplaint alleges nothing more than technical accessibility defects in certain “facilities,” the\npleadings are insufficient as a matter of law to state any claim against any public entity defendant. \nThis argument is flawed for several reasons.  \nFirst, the MDOC and WCRC ignore the command of 28 C.F.R. § 35.151.  The crux of the\nplaintiffs’ amended complaint is that, due to numerous specific accessibility defects in the curbs,\n-11-\n\nroadways, parking spaces and lots, and sidewalks within the City of Chelsea, they are unable safely\nto navigate the City’s pedestrian throughways, and they have been denied the full enjoyment and\nbenefit of the City’s public services such as municipal parking, parades, and City-sponsored\nfestivals.  The plaintiffs also allege that the sidewalk and curb defects make it impossible for them\nto traverse some public pedestrian routes at all, or to access certain public buildings such as the\nlibrary.  They contend that the problems have in some cases been caused by the removal of\naccessibility features that already were present.  And they maintain that the City, State, and County\nall have ignored the positive, specific mandate of 28 C.F.R. § 35.151, which required those entities,\nwhen building or repairing various public sidewalks after January 1992, affirmatively to ensure that\nthe design and construction of those features adhered to specific technical provisions of the ADA\nAccessibility Guidelines.  \nThe plaintiffs contend that the defendants — severally and jointly — have engaged in\nsubstantial construction or reconstruction projects within the city limits in recent years, and they\nrepeatedly have failed or refused to incorporate specific accessibility features mandated by the\nADAAG.  It has been widely accepted by the federal courts, including the Supreme Court, that\nsection 35.151 imposes a specific mandate on public entities to comply with the ADAAG in all new\nconstruction projects:\nAs Title II’s implementing regulations make clear, the reasonable modification\nrequirement can be satisfied in a number of ways. In the case of facilities built or\naltered after 1992, the regulations require compliance with specific architectural\naccessibility standards.  28 C.F.R. § 35.151 (2003).  But in the case of older\nfacilities, for which structural change is likely to be more difficult, a public entity\nmay comply with Title II by adopting a variety of less costly measures, including\nrelocating services to alternative, accessible sites and assigning aides to assist\npersons with disabilities in accessing services.  § 35.150(b)(1).  Only if these\nmeasures are ineffective in achieving accessibility is the public entity required to\nmake reasonable structural changes.\n-12-\n\nTennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509, 532 (2004) (emphasis added).\nThe State and County defendants contend that they are obligated under state law only to\nmaintain the paved driving surface of the roads within their respective rights of way, and that they\nhave no duty to maintain sidewalks in any accessible condition — or, indeed, to provide any\nsidewalks at all.  That may be true.  But the complaint alleges — and the defendants do not dispute,\nat least for the purposes of these motions — that the State and County authorities have in fact\nundertaken on their own authority to build, rebuild, alter, and maintain sidewalks along at least some\nportions of M-52 and Old U.S. 12 after January 1992.  All of those new construction and alterations\nprojects plainly were subject to the mandate that “[e]ach facility or part of a facility constructed by,\non behalf of, or for the use of a public entity shall be designed and constructed in such manner that\nthe facility or part of the facility is readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities,\nif the construction was commenced after January 26, 1992.”  28 C.F.R. § 35.151(a)(1); see also 28\nC.F.R. 35.150(b)(1) (“A public entity, in making alterations to existing buildings, shall meet the\naccessibility requirements of § 35.151.”).  Section 35.151 further expressly requires, with respect\nto “curb ramps” that “(1) Newly constructed or altered streets, roads, and highways must contain\ncurb ramps or other sloped areas at any intersection having curbs or other barriers to entry from a\nstreet level pedestrian walkway,” and “(2) Newly constructed or altered street level pedestrian\nwalkways must contain curb ramps or other sloped areas at intersections to streets, roads, or\nhighways.”  28 C.F.R. § 35.151(i).  The plaintiffs plainly allege that the defendants have built or\nrebuilt curbs, sidewalks, and parking spaces without regard to those specific statutory requirements,\nand that, in some cases, the defendants have removed accessibility features that already were\npresent, in order to replace them with accessibility obstacles.\n-13-\n\nSecond, the County and State defendants contend that under Babcock, “sidewalks” are\n“facilities,” not “services,” and they insist that the amended complaint is fatally flawed because it\ndoes not identify a service, program, or activity from which they were excluded. The defendants\nessentially contend that they have no obligation at all under the ADA — even in the case of new\nconstruction  —  to  include  any  specific  accessibility  features  in  any  sidewalk  or  roadway\nconstruction project.  But Babcock did not adopt any such counterintuitive reading of the ADA, and\nthe defendants’ position is sharply rebuked by both the plain language of the statute and by decades\nof case law.\nFor starters, the State and County defendants’ position ignores the most apparent dispositive\ndistinction between this case and Babcock: Babcock only involved complaints of accessibility\ndefects in an existing facility, not new construction.  Babcock, 812 F.3d at 536 (“ADA regulations\naddressing existing facilities provide that a public entity may comply with the ADA without altering\na structure, such as by ‘reassignment of services to accessible buildings, assignment of aides to\nbeneficiaries, home visits, delivery of services at alternate accessible sites . . . or any other methods\nthat result in making its services, programs, or activities readily accessible.’” (citing 28 C.F.R. §\n35.150(b), and 28 C.F.R. § 39.150(a)(1) (“noting that programs or activities must be ‘readily\naccessible to and usable by handicapped persons,’ but it is not ‘necessarily require[d that] the agency\nmake each of its existing facilities accessible to and usable by handicapped persons.’”)) (emphasis\nadded); see also Cohen v. City of Culver City, 754 F.3d 690, 699 (9th Cir. 2014) (“Sections 35.150\nand 35.151 both implement, in different circumstances, the ADA’s requirement that public entities\nmake reasonable modifications to accommodate persons with disabilities.  The less stringent\ndemands of § 35.150 govern when it would be unreasonable to expect public entities to comply with\n-14-\n\nthe more exacting standards of § 35.151.”); Greer v. Richardson Indep. Sch. Dist., 472 F. App’x\n287, 300 (5th Cir. 2012) (“The parking lot and the ramp have both been modified or constructed\nafter 1992 and thus do not fall within the more flexible guidelines for existing facilities.  Instead,\nthe ADAAG guidelines apply.”).\nThe majority opinion in Babcock did not discuss, or even cite, section 35.151, which imposes\na more demanding and specific standard on newly constructed or altered public facilities, as opposed\nto older existing facilities that were built before 1992.  As the Supreme Court noted in Tennessee\nv. Lane, and as the Sixth Circuit plainly held in Ability Center of Greater Toledo v. City of Sandusky,\n385 F.3d 901 (6th Cir. 2004), section 35.151 imposes a positive mandate to ensure that all newly\nconstructed public “facilities” — and in particular streets and sidewalks comprising pedestrian travel\nroutes — include certain specific accessibility features:\nPursuant to § 204, the Attorney General adopted 28 C.F.R. § 35.151, which provides\nthat alterations of facilities commenced after January 26, 1992, “by, on behalf of, or\nfor the use of a public entity in a manner that affects or could affect the usability of\nthe facility or part of the facility shall, to the maximum extent feasible, be altered in\nsuch manner that the altered portion of the facility is readily accessible and usable\nby individuals with disabilities.”  Id. § 35.151(b).  The regulation further specifies\nthat alterations should meet certain accessibility standards, id. § 35.151(c), and that\naltered streets and pedestrian walkways must contain curb ramps.  Id. § 35.151(e). \nSection 35.151 is part of a broader regulatory scheme that aims to effectuate § 202\nof the ADA.  See 28 C.F.R. § 35.101.\nAbility Center, 385 F.3d at 904 (emphasis added).  The Sixth Circuit, relying on Ability Center, later\nconsidered and squarely rejected the position that the State and County now take here, holding\ninstead that a plaintiff has “a private right of action to pursue her claims based on the failure of [a\ncity] to comply with regulations concerning the accessibility of facilities.”  Dillery v. City of\nSandusky, 398 F.3d 562, 567 (6th Cir. 2005), abrogated on other grounds by Anderson v. City of\nBlue Ash, 798 F.3d 338, 357 n.1 (6th Cir. 2015) (“Our test for intentional discrimination under Title\n-15-\n\nII of the ADA previously required that the discrimination be ‘solely’ because of the plaintiff’s\ndisability, [see Dillery, 398 F.3d at 567], but our decision in Lewis v. Humboldt Acquisition Corp.,\n681 F.3d 312, 317 (6th Cir. 2012) (en banc), rejected this sole-causation requirement.”).  The Dillery\ncourt held that the “[d]efendants’ argument that Dillery does not have a private cause of action to\npursue relief based on the ADA’s accessibility regulations fails based on Ability Center.”  Ibid.  \nThe Babcock panel did not abrogate or overrule Ability Center or Dillery — nor could it have\n— and the panel did not even suggest that it took issue with those binding, published decisions.  In\nfact, in a footnote, the majority in Babcock carefully distinguished between complaints relating only\nto alleged defects in a “facility” comprising one specific public building — which the plaintiff had\nfailed to allege was the home of any public service of interest to her — as compared with allegations\nof accessibility defects in public sidewalks, which the majority viewed as a hybrid of “facility” and\n“service” traditionally maintained by municipal entities.  Babcock, 812 F.3d at 539 n.5.  Discussing\nthe competing opinions in Frame v. City of Arlington, 657 F.3d 215 (5th Cir. 2011) (en banc), the\nBabcock majority acknowledged that “the Frame majority emphasized that the public has a ‘general\ndemand’ for ‘safe transportation,’ and so a ‘sidewalk’ qualifies as a ‘service.’”  Babcock, 812 F.3d\nat 539 n.5.  The court declined to apply that reasoning to the general building features of Cadillac\nPlace, because “[those] design features are not ordinarily ‘provided in common to all citizens,’ so\nwe are hard-pressed to conclude that they qualify as ‘services,’ like sidewalks under the Fifth Circuit\nmajority’s approach.”  Ibid.  Morever, Judge Rogers in his concurrence specifically noted that\nBabcock left open the question whether “sidewalks” comprise “services” within the meaning of the\nADA, and opined that they almost certainly do:\nWhile the majority relies substantially on the reasoning of the Frame dissent, the\nmajority in this case carefully notes ways in which the case of sidewalks may be\n-16-\n\ndifferent from the building designs before us.  Ante, at 538 n.5.  Our decision today\nthus does not necessarily control a future case involving sidewalks.  There is some\nroom for the possibility that sidewalks may qualify as services even if the design\nfeatures of a building do not.  A city’s sidewalks are more critical to the everyday\ntransportation needs of the general public than are the design features of a specific\nbuilding.  The conclusion that sidewalks may qualify as a service is supported by a\n2004 decision from this court, a Title II implementing regulation, and the Justice\nDepartment’s amicus briefs in several sidewalk cases.  Our judgment today does not\nresolve the question.\nBabcock, 812 F.3d at 543 (Rogers, J., concurring) (emphasis added).\nThird, the defendants’ position that they have no obligation to comply with the specific\nmandates of the ADAAG in constructing or altering new public sidewalks has been solidly rejected\nby the federal courts that have considered it.  Those courts repeatedly have held that when a public\nentity “builds new sidewalks or alters existing ones for reasons other than retrofitting to achieve\nADA compliance, § 35.151 plainly requires it to build a curb ramp at every intersection unless doing\nso would be structurally impracticable.”  Cohen, 754 F.3d at 698 (citing   28 C.F.R. § 35.151(i); see\nalso Fortyune v. City of Lomita, 766 F.3d 1098, 1100 (9th Cir. 2014) (“In this case, we must decide\nwhether Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (‘ADA’) requires local governments to\nprovide accessible on-street parking in the absence of regulatory design specifications for on-street\nparking facilities. We hold that it does.”); Cohen, 754 F.3d at 695 (“A city sidewalk is [] a ‘service,\nprogram, or activity’ of a public entity within the meaning of Title II.”); Frame v. City of Arlington,\n657 F.3d 215, 223 (5th Cir. 2011) (en banc) (“Based on statutory text and structure, we hold that\nTitle II and § 504 unambiguously extend to newly built and altered public sidewalks. We further\nhold that the plaintiffs have a private right of action to enforce Title II and § 504 to the extent they\nwould require the City to make reasonable modifications to such sidewalks.”); Barden v. City of\nSacramento, 292 F.3d 1073, 1076 (9th Cir. 2002) (“[M]aintaining public sidewalks is a normal\n-17-\n\nfunction of a city and without a doubt something that the City ‘does.’  Maintaining their accessibility\nfor individuals with disabilities therefore falls within the scope of Title II.” (quotations and citations\nomitted)).\nAny sensible reading of ADA Title II compels the conclusion that maintaining public\npedestrian thoroughfares for citizens to get around a city — and access the many public services and\nbusinesses located within — is the archetypal example of the most fundamental of public services. \nInaccessible sidewalks are, in fact, the single most readily conceivable example of a basic obstacle\nto accessibility that comes to mind when considering the purpose that animates the ADA, which is\nto eliminate obstacles to the full enjoyment of public life by disabled citizens.  See PGA Tour, Inc.\nv. Martin, 532 U.S. 661, 675 (2001) (“To effectuate its sweeping purpose, the ADA forbids\ndiscrimination against disabled individuals in major areas of public life . . . .”).  It is simply common\nsense: If disabled pedestrians cannot access the sidewalks, then they can hardly access anything else\nthat a city has to offer.\nFourth, even under the defendants’ crabbed reading of the rule of Babcock, the allegations\nhere are sufficient to state a claim that the “facility” defects alleged have obstructed the plaintiffs’\naccess to public “services.”  Leaving aside the question whether providing and maintaining\npedestrian thoroughfares in the form of public sidewalks is itself a public “service” — though it\ncertainly is under any reasonable construction of that term — the plaintiffs here plainly have alleged\nthat the sidewalk and parking area defects of which they complain have prevented them from\naccessing numerous public services such as public parking lots and spaces, City-sponsored parades\nand festivals, and even the public library.  The Babcock case plainly does not say what the State and\n-18-\n\nCounty think it says.  But even if it did, the allegations here are sufficient to pass muster under any\nreasonable reading of that decision.\nB.\nThe State and County defendants also believe that their “roadway” construction projects —\nwhether or not they also may involve constructing or altering sidewalks — are immune from\nscrutiny under the ADA because, even if they incorporate obvious accessibility obstacles, those\ndefendants are not liable for any resulting denial of access to public “services,” because any such\nservices are not provided by them, but instead are provided by the City of Chelsea.  But the ADA\nmakes no such distinction between the entity responsible for causing an obstruction and the\n(possibly separate) entity that provides a service that is obstructed by accessibility defects.  “Section\n35.151 is part of a broader regulatory scheme that aims to effectuate § 202 of the ADA,” Ability\nCenter, 385 F.3d at 904, and that “scheme makes explicit that ‘no qualified individual with a\ndisability shall, because a public entity’s facilities are inaccessible to or unusable by individuals\nwith disabilities, be excluded from participation in, or be denied the benefits of the services,\nprograms, or activities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any public entity,’”\nibid. (quoting 28 C.F.R. § 35.149).  \nThe regulations plainly state that no disabled person shall be denied the benefits of the\n“services of . . . a public entity” because “a public entity’s facilities are inaccessible.”  Nowhere does\nthe statute state that “a public entity” must be the same entity that both provides a service and creates\nor maintains the inaccessible facility that obstructs access to it.  Nor can any such restriction sensibly\nbe read into the law, since it is apparent that in many cases the agencies that construct and maintain\ngovernment facilities and those that operate within or among those facilities will be entirely distinct. \n-19-\n\nIf mere bureaucratic segregation between individual government agencies that build and maintain\nfacilities and those that operate within them is all that is required to escape the mandate of the ADA,\nthen the result would be that many — perhaps most — public facilities actually in existence today\nwould be entirely exempt from the Act’s accessibility mandate.  Such a tortured reading of Title II\nof the ADA would lead to an unwarranted — and absurd — result.  \nBecause the plaintiffs (and third-party plaintiff) have pleaded all the necessary elements of\ntheir claims under Title II of the ADA, the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and the PWDCRA, the Court\nwill deny the motions for judgment on the pleadings.   \nIII.\nThe plaintiffs also have moved for leave to file a second amended complaint to add the\nWCRC as a direct defendant.  Such motions are treated with liberality, Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(2), but\nthey may be denied upon a showing of “undue delay, bad faith by the moving party, repeated failure\nto cure defects by previously-allowed amendments, futility of the proposed new claim, or undue\nprejudice to the opposite party.”  Foman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178, 182 (1962); Duggins v. Steak ‘N\nShake, Inc., 195 F.3d 828, 834 (6th Cir. 1999).  Both the MDOC and the WCRC oppose the motion\non futility grounds, citing the arguments discussed and rejected above.  But the WCRC also contends\nthat the motion should be denied because of the plaintiffs’ undue delay, asserting that the plaintiffs\nknew for months that it was a potential defendant, but they did not seek leave to file an amended\ncomplaint until November 2016, more than three months after the third-party complaint was filed. \nThat argument is not persuasive.  Delay alone does not justify denial of a motion brought\nunder Rule 15(a).  Security Ins. Co. of Hartford v. Kevin Tucker & Assocs., Inc., 64 F.3d 1001, 1009\n(6th Cir. 1995).  Nor does the Rule establish a deadline within which a party must file a motion to\n-20-\n\namend. See Lloyd v. United Liquors Corp., 203 F.2d 789, 793-94 (6th Cir. 1953) (reviewing a\ndistrict court’s denial of a motion to amend after the entry of summary judgment). Of course, the\nparty seeking to amend must “act with due diligence if it wants to take advantage of the Rule’s\nliberality.”  Parry v. Mohawk Motors of Michigan, Inc., 236 F.3d 299, 306 (6th Cir. 2000) (internal\nquotation marks omitted).  But a party opposing an amendment based on delay must make “some\nsignificant showing of prejudice to the opponent.”  Moore v. City of Paducah, 790 F.2d 557, 562\n(6th Cir. 1986).  An amendment to a complaint prejudices a party where the amendment will require\nthat party to prepare an additional defense strategy and expend additional resources to defend against\nnew claims.  See Troxel Mfg. Co. v. Schwinn Bicycle Co., 489 F.2d 968, 971 (6th Cir. 1973). \nThere was no substantial delay in moving for the amendment.  The plaintiffs assert that they\ndid not know when the original complaint was filed that it was the County and not the City that was\nprimarily responsible for and in control of Old U.S. 12 within the city limits, and after they learned\nthat fact as a result of the City’s third-party complaint, some of the ensuing time was consumed by\nefforts to negotiate a settlement with all of the defendants, and some discussions about whether the\nCounty would or would not concur in a motion to amend.  The County does not dispute those\nassertions.  \nThe WCRC has made no credible showing of prejudice.  It has been a party to the action\nsince the third-party complaint was filed by the City.  In its motion to dismiss the third-party\ncomplaint, the WCRC directly challenged the substantive allegations of the primary complaint,\ncontending that it fails to state any claim on which relief can be granted against any of the\ndefendants.  And the WCRC essentially has responded to and participated in the litigation as a\nprimary defendant since it was joined by the third-party complaint, including, as the plaintiffs\n-21-\n\ncontend without dispute, by serving extensive discovery requests on the plaintiffs on November 11,\n2016.  The WCRC has not suggested any way in which it would be substantially prejudiced by a\nmere realignment of parties in the caption.  \nFinally, no purpose would be served by requiring the plaintiffs to file a separate action\nagainst the County in order to proceed against it directly.  Moreover, although the County takes\nsome issue with the exact scope of its authority, it does not deny that it has at least some substantial\npart of the responsibility for and control over the Old U.S. 12 right-of-way that runs through the\nCity, and it does not deny that it has engaged in at least some construction and maintenance of that\nroadway during the time frame relevant to the complaint.  \nIt is true that under the Court’s scheduling order, discovery has closed and summary\njudgment motions are due.  However, the parties have suggested and the Court is willing to entertain\nan adjustment to the deadlines to address any disadvantage that may have resulted from the timing\nof the present decision.  The WCRC is free to present a proposal to amend the current schedule to\nalleviate any marginal prejudice that the realignment of the parties might cause.  \nIV.\nThe parties — or some of them — evidently engaged in settlement negotiations, and the\nplaintiffs and the City of Chelsea were able to reach a compromise that they ask the Court to embody\nin the form of a consent decree.  The WCRC opposes the request on the grounds that it believes the\nclaims in the amended complaint are without merit, the proposed settlement agreement is ambiguous\nand indefinite in scope, and entry of the consent decree may impair its ability to defend against the\nclaims raised in the third-party complaint and proposed second amended complaint.  \n-22-\n\nThe plaintiffs assert that the decree does not purport to bind either the State or the County,\nand it does not resolve any claims other than those against the City itself.  The plaintiffs point out\nthat the decree contemplates that the parties to it will engage in discussions with the County and\nState before implementing or attempting to implement any measures that compliance with it may\nrequire.  But if those entities remain uncooperative, the plaintiffs fully are prepared to proceed with\nthe litigation against them concerning the roadway areas that are under their exclusive purview, and\nover which the City has no control.  \n“‘A consent decree is essentially a settlement agreement subject to continued judicial\npolicing.’”  Pedreira v. Sunrise Children’s Servs., Inc., 802 F.3d 865, 871 (6th Cir. 2015) (quoting\nWilliams v. Vukovich, 720 F.2d 909, 920 (6th Cir. 1983)).  “Consent decrees typically have two key\nattributes that make them different from private settlements.  First, when a court enters a consent\ndecree, it retains jurisdiction to enforce the decree.  In contrast, the parties to a private settlement\ntypically must bring another suit (for breach of contract) to enforce it.  Second, a consent decree puts\n‘the power and prestige of the court behind the compromise struck by the parties.’”  Ibid. (quoting\nWilliams, 720 F.2d at 920).  “The same is not true of a dismissal order that does not incorporate the\nparties’ terms.”  Ibid.  “[C]onsent decrees are a prospective form of relief involving continuous court\noversight.  They are designed to be a flexible remedy, easily modifiable when the facts or law as to\nthe parties change.”  Whitlock v. FSL Mgmt., LLC, 843 F.3d 1084, 1094 (6th Cir. 2016).  \nThe force of a consent decree comes from “the parties’ acquiescence, not rules of law.”  City\nof Warren v. City of Detroit, 495 F.3d 282, 287 (6th Cir. 2007) (citing Local No. 93, Int’l Ass’n of\nFirefighters v. City of Cleveland, 478 U.S. 501, 522 (1986)).  Therefore, only the parties who agree\ncan be bound by it.  Such a decree “‘may not dispose of the claims of a third party, and a fortiori\n-23-\n\nmay not impose duties or obligations on a third party, without that party’s agreement.’”  Ibid.\n(quoting Firefighters, 478 U.S. at 529).  \nThese rules protect the WCRC from any adverse impact on it of the consent decree.  The\nproposed consent decree binds only the parties to it, which are explicitly named to be the individual\nplaintiffs and the City itself.  The decree even states that it does not purport to bind the other\ndefendants.  The parties to the decree apparently regard it as sufficiently specific for their purposes,\nand the County’s concerns in that respect are immaterial since the decree imposes no duty of\nperformance on any entity other than the City.  The County vaguely alludes to fears that the\ncompromise of the plaintiffs’ claims as to the City may impair its ability to defend the claims against\nitself in this case, but it has not offered any factual or legal basis for that concern.  None of the\nCounty’s defenses to the claims against it, either as a third-party or a primary defendant, are or could\nbe impaired or foreclosed by entry of a consent decree that binds only the plaintiffs and a separate\npublic entity, where the County has not itself consented to entry of the decree.  Warren, 495 F.3d\nat 286 (“At the outset, it is important to note that Warren is not a party to any of the consent\njudgments, is not bound by the judgments, and is entitled to its ‘own day in court’ to challenge\nactions taken under the judgments.” (quoting Martin v. Wilks, 490 U.S. 755, 761-62 (1989))); United\nStates v. City of Miami, 614 F.2d 1322, 1329 (5th Cir. 1980) (“Unless the [defendant] can\ndemonstrate that it has been ordered to take some action by the decree, or ordered not to take some\naction, or that its rights or legitimate interests have otherwise been affected, it has no right to prevent\nthe other parties and the Court from signing the decree.”).\nThe cases that the County relies upon for the proposition that the Court must hold a hearing\nand approve a consent decree only after finding that it meets certain criteria of fairness of\n-24-\n\nreasonableness are inapposite, because they involved compromises of specific types of claims such\nas labor disputes or class actions, where extra attention by the Court is mandated by the applicable\nstatutes or case law, or where the decree necessarily must foreclose the rights of absent parties.  See\nCity of Miami, 614 F.2d at 1330 (noting that only in “certain special situations [is] the trial court . . .\nrequired by statute or rule to approve a settlement to which the parties to the litigation have agreed,”\nwhich include “proposed class action settlements, proposed shareholder derivative suit settlements,\nand proposed compromises of claims in bankruptcy court”) (citations omitted).  Otherwise, “an\nactive role for the trial court in approving the adequacy of a settlement is the exceptional situation,\nnot the general rule.”  Id. at 1331.  No such unusual claims or concerns are present in this case,\nwhich does not involve any of the circumstances that typically would prompt close judicial scrutiny\nof a proposed settlement.\nFinally, any concern of the parties (or the Court) as to the indefinite term of judicial\nsupervision under the decree readily may be remedied by inclusion of an appropriate sunset date in\nthe final version of the decree entered by the Court, or by a later motion to modify or terminate the\ndecree.  \nV.\nThe plaintiffs have stated valid claims in their first amended complaint under Title II of the\nADA, the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and the PWDCRA.  There is no good reason why the plaintiffs\nshould not be able to amend their complaint once again to plead their claims directly against the\nWCRC.  Likewise, there is no valid reason for refusing the proposed consent decree between the\nplaintiffs and defendant City of Chelsea.   \n-25-\n\nAccordingly, it is ORDERED that the motions for judgment on the pleadings [dkt. #26, 30]\nare DENIED.  \nIt is further ORDERED that the plaintiffs’ motion for leave to file a second amended\ncomplaint [dkt. #34, 36] is GRANTED.  The plaintiffs must file their second amended complaint\non the docket on or before May 23, 2017.  \nIt is further ORDERED that the joint motion to approve the consent decree [dkt. #31] is\nGRANTED.  The plaintiffs and the Chelsea defendants must present their proposed decree to the\nCourt on or before May 30, 2017.  The parties should include a proposed date for termination of\nthe Court’s jurisdiction to enforce the decree, or an explanation why such a termination date is\nimpractical.  \nIt is further ORDERED that the parties must appear for a status conference on May 30, 2017\nat 4:00 p.m. to discuss what adjustments, if any, should be made to the Case Management and\nScheduling Order [dkt. #13], as amended [dkt. #47].\ns/David M.

MOTE, DEBORAH \nCLARK, CARLOS GRAY-LION, \nBRENDA BARANIAK, KAREN STREET,   Case Number 16-11546 \nMERLYN STREET, JENNIFER KUNDAK,  Honorable David M. Lawson \nLEE BENTON, by next friends Ronald M. \nBenton and Marion Benton, J.N., a minor, by \nnext friends Daniel and Mary Jane Nelson, \nANN ARBOR CENTER FOR \nINDEPENDENT LIVING, INC., and, \nJENNIFER KUNDAK, \n \n  Plaintiffs,     \nv.       \n \nCITY OF CHELSEA and CHELSEA \nDOWNTOWN DEVELOPMENT \nAUTHORITY, \n \n  Defendants. \n    / \nSECOND CONSENT DECREE \n  On April 28, 2016, the plaintiffs filed their complaint alleging violations of their rights to \naccessible public pedestrian thoroughfares under the Americans With Disabilities Act.  On May \n19, 2017, the Court issued an opinion and order granting a joint motion by the plaintiffs and \ndefendants City of Chelsea and Chelsea Downtown Development Authority (DDA) (hereinafter \njointly referred to as Chelsea) to approve their proposed consent decree accomplishing a partial \nsettlement of the plaintiffs’ claims against those defendants.  On August 4, 2017, the Court entered \na first consent decree embodying the terms of the partial settlement. \n  The Court subsequently dismissed all of the plaintiffs’ claims against former defendant \nMichigan Department of Transportation (MDOT).  The case then proceeded to a bench trial against \nthe remaining defendants, Chelsea, its DDA, and Washtenaw County Road Commission (WCRC).  \n\nCase 2:16-cv-11546-DML-EAS   ECF No. 154, PageID.6128   Filed 12/14/20   Page 2 of 6\nAfter the trial concluded, the Court issued a judgment in favor of the plaintiffs and against \ndefendant Washtenaw County Road Commission, directing the County to fix or replace certain \ninaccessible sidewalk features.  The County appealed, but while the appeal was pending the \nCounty concluded a settlement with the plaintiffs, and the appeal was dismissed. \n  On December 14, 2020, the plaintiffs and the City of Chelsea submitted to the Court a \nsecond consent decree finalizing certain terms of their agreement which were left unresolved by \nthe first consent decree.  The parties agree that nothing in this second consent decree involves or \naffects MDOT or WCRC, and nothing in this second consent decree implicates any facilities along \nMain Street (SR 52), which is the only roadway inside Chelsea under MDOT’s jurisdiction, or Old \nHighway 12, which is the only roadway inside Chelsea under WCRC’s jurisdiction. \n  The parties further agree that the City has performed its obligations under the first consent \ndecree of examining for ADA compliance all of its facilities, including curb cuts and designated \naccessible municipal parking spaces, and filing annual reports of its inspections with the Court. \nThe City has assured the plaintiffs that it intends to bring all of these facilities into compliance \nwith the ADA, and the parties have agreed on a timetable for certain necessary facility alterations, \nwhich are embodied in this second consent decree.  However, the parties stipulate that nothing in \nthis second consent decree alters the continuing obligations of the parties under the first consent \ndecree, except as expressly set forth herein. \n  The original consent decree also required the City to measure its curb ramps and to report \nthe results to the Court.  Chelsea did this in its First Annual Report.  That report listed hundreds of \ndefective curb ramps and represented that Chelsea intended to correct each of these to be set forth \nin a second consent decree.  Since that time, Chelsea has corrected approximately twenty of the \ndefective ramps. The parties agree that it is obvious that Chelsea will not be able to correct the \n- 2 - \n\nCase 2:16-cv-11546-DML-EAS   ECF No. 154, PageID.6129   Filed 12/14/20   Page 3 of 6\nmajority of the remaining problematic curb ramps by the sunset date of the consent decree term.  \nCurrently, Chelsea is inspecting its defective curb ramps to see which, if any, it believes may be \ntechnically infeasible to fully repair, and it will file a report with the Court by the end of year 2021.  \nThe parties then will negotiate a timetable for repairing the defective curb ramps, to be given force \nin a third and final consent decree.  The plaintiffs and Chelsea agree that the outstanding issues \nwith curb ramps should not impede the entry of this second consent decree to resolve issues with \naccessible municipal parking spaces and locations. \n  Accordingly, pursuant to the consent of the parties, the following is ORDERED AND \nADJUDGED. \n  I.  DESIGN  STANDARD  FOR  ACCESSIBLE  PARKING  SPACES  AND \nADJACENT ACCESSIBLE ROUTES.  The design specifications for accessible parking spaces \nand adjacent accessible routes were set forth in Exhibit 3 to the first consent decree.  That is the \nUSDOJ ADA Design Guide 1, Restriping Parking Lots, which was published in December 2015. \nIt is available online at http://www.ada.gov/restripe.pdf; https://adata.org/factsheet/parking.  After \nentry of the first consent decree, Chelsea restriped all of its municipal parking spaces.  Exhibit 3 \nto the first consent decree is incorporated herein and remains the standard for Chelsea to meet for \neach designated parking space and adjacent accessible route set forth below in this second consent \ndecree. \n  II.  ACCESSIBLE PARKING SPACES BY LOCATION.  Defendant Chelsea shall \nensure that the following locations contain the following number of accessible parking spaces, and \nthat all modifications to that end including adjacent accessible routes are installed in compliance \nwith the requirements Exhibit 3 by the end of calendar year 2021. \n  Municipal Parking Lot #1.  A total of four van accessible parking spaces. \n- 3 - \n\nCase 2:16-cv-11546-DML-EAS   ECF No. 154, PageID.6130   Filed 12/14/20   Page 4 of 6\n  Municipal Parking Lot #2 (Common Grill).  A total of two van accessible parking spaces, \nand two car accessible parking spaces. \n  Municipal Parking Lot #3 (North half Library).  A total of two van accessible parking \nspaces. \n  Municipal Parking Lot #3 (South half Library).  A total of two van accessible parking \nspaces. \n  Municipal Parking Lot #4 (CAFA).  A total of two van accessible parking spaces, and one \ncar accessible parking space. \n  Municipal Parking Lot #5 (Depot).  A total of two van accessible parking spaces, and two \ncar accessible parking spaces.  The parties acknowledge that the Depot owns part of this \nlot, but that the City anticipates that the Depot will cooperate with the placement of these \nfour accessible parking spaces.  The City will make all best efforts and will promptly notify \nplaintiffs’ counsel via email if the Depot prohibits fulfillment of these four accessible \nparking spaces.  The parties reserve all legal claims and defenses as to these four accessible \nspaces if the specified modifications are not completed. \n  Municipal Parking Lot #6 (Heydlauff’s).  A total of two van accessible parking spaces. \n  Police Department/City Office Parking Lot.  A total of two van accessible parking spaces. \n  City Office Parking Lot.  A total of two van accessible parking spaces. \n  Palmer Parking Lot.  A total of two van accessible parking spaces. \n  Congregational Church Parking Lot.  A total of two van accessible parking spaces. \n  Accessible On-Street Parking Spaces.  Defendant Chelsea provides on-street parking in \ndowntown Chelsea.  Chelsea shall install five on-street van accessible parking spaces, each \nwith an eight-foot blue hatched access aisle, and a curb cut onto the sidewalk either directly \n- 4 - \n\nCase 2:16-cv-11546-DML-EAS   ECF No. 154, PageID.6131   Filed 12/14/20   Page 5 of 6\nin front or in in back of the accessible parking space.  None of these five spaces will be \nlocated on MDOT’s Main Street (SR 52) or on WCRC’s Old Highway 12. \n  Not later than December 31, 2021, Defendant Chelsea shall file a report with the Court \ncertifying that each above parking space and adjacent accessible route has been installed and is \nfully compliant with Exhibit 3 to the first consent decree.  If at any time defendant Chelsea believes \nthat it cannot install an accessible parking space or adjacent accessible route in strict compliance \nwith Exhibit 3, Chelsea shall initiate, and the parties shall follow the dispute resolution procedure \nset forth at Section XI of the first consent decree. \n  III.  ATTORNEYS FEES AND COSTS.  Between January 2 and January 15, 2021, the \nCity of Chelsea and Chelsea Downtown Development Authority shall pay to Heberle & Finnegan, \nPLLC the sum of $10,836.15 for costs and attorney fees.  This amount shall constitute payment in \nfull for all attorney fees and costs incurred by the plaintiffs through December 14, 2021.  Payment \nof the agreed upon attorney fees by the defendants shall not be construed as an admission of \nliability for any future payments, and acceptance by the plaintiffs shall not be construed as a waiver \nof any claims for costs or fees that may be incurred in the future. \n  IV.  TERM.  The provisions of this second consent decree shall remain in force through \nthe remainder of the term of the first consent decree, which expires on August 4, 2022.  Any party \nmay file an appropriate motion with the Court, at any time before the expiration of that initial term, \nto renew the term of this second consent decree for a specified additional term of years, stating the \nreasons why further oversight by the Court is needed.  The Court shall retain jurisdiction to enforce \nthis consent decree throughout the initial term and any succeeding renewal terms.  If any party \nbelieves, at any time during the initial term or any renewal term, that Court oversight no longer is \nneeded, then the party may file a motion to vacate the decree or shorten its term. \n- 5 - \n\nCase 2:16-cv-11546-DML-EAS   ECF No. 154, PageID.6132   Filed 12/14/20   Page 6 of 6\n  V.  OTHER PROVISIONS APPLICABLE.  All other provisions of the first consent \ndecree, except as expressly modified or disclaimed herein, shall continue in force throughout its \nremaining term, and those same provisions to the extent that they apply to the agreements herein, \ne.g., the procedure for dispute resolution in Section XI of the first consent decree, also shall bind \nthe parties with respect to their performance under this second consent decree. \n    s/David M.

Recently, the United States celebrated the twenty-fifth anniversary \nof the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). According to Congress, fully \naccessible sidewalks, street level transit stops, and pedestrian crossings are \nthe ADA’s corner-stone:  \nThe  employment,  transportation,  and  public  accommodation \nsections  of  this  [Americans  with  Disabilities]  Act  would  be \nmeaningless if people who use wheelchairs were not afforded \nthe opportunity to travel on and between the streets. \n \nH.R. Rep. No. 101-485, pt. 2, at 84 (1990), reprinted in 1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. \n303, 367.  \n  1 \n\n2:16-cv-11546-DML-EAS   Doc # 16   Filed 08/04/16   Pg 2 of 35    Pg ID 163\n  2. In Chelsea, people with mobility impairments, who use wheelchairs \nor other adaptive aid, find that Chelsea’s streets and walks are not readily \naccessible  to  and  usable  by  them.  And  while  Chelsea  is  in  some  ways  \nbecoming more accessible, in other, critical ways, Chelsea is regressing in \naccessibility, by permitting downtown businesses to renovate while creating \nnew steps and other barriers to access, and by Chelsea itself removing long \nexisting curb ramps and replacing them with grass and new, solid curbs, \namong other practices, detailed below. \n  3.  This  lawsuit  concerns  only  services,  programs,  activities  and \nfacilities located within the borders of the City of Chelsea. Plaintiffs bring \nthis lawsuit to make defendants’ facilities, services, programs and activities \naccessible according to law.  \n    4. More than a decade ago, when interpreting the ADA, the federal \nSixth Circuit Court of Appeals found:  \n  “[F]ailing to provide curb cuts and other accommodations in \nthe course of altering city streets and sidewalks in violation \nof  [28  C.F.R.  ]  §  35.151  denies  the  disabled  meaningful \naccess  to  public  services  by  perpetuating  architectural \nbarriers that impede such access…”.  \n \nAbility Center of Greater Toledo v City of Sandusky, Ohio, 385 F.3d 901, \n913-914  (6th  Cir.  2004).  However,  ten  years  later,  the  majority  of \nintersections in  Chelsea  lack  one  or  more  required  ADA-compliant  curb \n  2 \n\n2:16-cv-11546-DML-EAS   Doc # 16   Filed 08/04/16   Pg 3 of 35    Pg ID 164\ncuts. Making things worse with each new resurfacing project, defendants are \nremoving existing curb cuts and replacing them with new solid curbs. And, \nthe sidewalks and street level transit stops in between these missing curb \ncuts have many barriers making sidewalks dangerous for pedestrians with \ndisabilities. \n  5. Individual Plaintiffs Shauna M. Mote, Deborah Clark, Carlos Gray-\nLion, Brenda Baraniak, Karen Street, Merlyn Street, Jennifer Kundak, Lee \nBenton, through Next Friends, Ronald M. Benton and Marion Benton, and \nJ.N., a minor, through next friends Daniel and Mary Jane Nelson, bring this \nlawsuit  to  make  Chelsea  accessible  according  to  law.  Each  of  these \nindividuals  lives,  works,  or  frequently  travels  for  business  or  pleasure \nthroughout Chelsea Michigan. Each is a person with a mobility disability \nand has been personally discriminated against and subjected to hazardous \nconditions due to the access barriers at issue in this case. Each would benefit \nby the removal of these barriers. \n  6. The Ann Arbor Center for Independent Living, (AACIL) represents \npersons with disabilities throughout southeast Michigan, including Chelsea, \nwho have been or will be discriminated against and subjected to hazardous \nconditions due to the access barriers at issue in this case. Previously, AACIL \n  3 \n\n2:16-cv-11546-DML-EAS   Doc # 16   Filed 08/04/16   Pg 4 of 35    Pg ID 165\nsuccessfully brought similar lawsuits against the Michigan cities Monroe (in \n2002), Ann Arbor (in 2004), and Ypsilanti (in 2005).  \n  7. The Defendants are the City of Chelsea, the Chelsea Downtown \nDevelopment  Authority,  (“DDA”)  and  the  Michigan  Department  of \nTransportation, (“MDOT”). \n  8.  Defendants—through  defective  construction  and  alterations, \ncombined  with  insufficient  maintenance  and  enforcement—have \ncontinuously failed to ensure that their sidewalks, street crossings, street \nlevel  transit  stops,  and  certain  other  facilities,  services,  programs  and \nactivities are readily usable by and accessible to Plaintiffs and others. \n           II.   JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n9. This is an action for declaratory and final injunctive relief, brought \npursuant  to  the  Americans  with  Disabilities  Act  (“ADA”),  42  U.S.C.  § \n12101 to 12213, specifically Title II of the ADA, and Section 504 of the \nRehabilitation  Act  of  1973,  29  U.S.C.  §  794  et  seq.,  and  Michigan’s \nPWDCRA.   \n9.A. This Court has jurisdiction over this action under 28 U.S.C. §§ \n1331 and 1343 for claims arising under the ADA and Section 504 of the \nRehabilitation Act. \n  4 \n\n2:16-cv-11546-DML-EAS   Doc # 16   Filed 08/04/16   Pg 5 of 35    Pg ID 166\n9.B.  This  Court  has  jurisdiction  to  issue  a  declaratory  judgment \npursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 and 2202. \n  9.C.  Venue  is  proper  under  28  U.S.C.  §  1391(b)  because  each \ndefendant  is located in the Eastern District and the events and/or omissions \ngiving  rise  to  Plaintiffs’  claims  occurred  inside  the  City  of  Chelsea, \nMichigan, in this District. \n  9.D. Jurisdiction in Count III is based on this Court's supplemental \njurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1367, because the Michigan State law \nclaims arise out a common nucleus of facts with the federal law claims. In \naddition, the ADA and PWDCRA \"substantially mirror\" each other. Donald \nv. Sybra, Inc., 667 F.3d 757, 764 (6th Cir. 2012). Therefore, \"claims under \nboth statutes are generally analyzed identically.\" Steward v. New Chrysler, \n415 Fed. Appx. 632, 641 (6th Cir.2011). \nIII.   PARTIES \n  10.  Individual  Plaintiffs  Shauna  M.  Mote,  Deborah  Clark,  Carlos \nGray-Lion, Brenda Baraniak, Karen Street, Merlyn Street, Jennifer Kundak, \nLee Benton, through Next Friends, Ronald M. Benton and Marion Benton, \nand J.N., a minor, through next friends Daniel and Mary Jane Nelson, each \nlives,  works,  or  frequently  travels  for  business  or  pleasure  throughout \nChelsea, Michigan.  \n  5 \n\n2:16-cv-11546-DML-EAS   Doc # 16   Filed 08/04/16   Pg 6 of 35    Pg ID 167\n  11. Each individual Plaintiff has a mobility impairment, and must rely \nupon a wheelchair, braces, crutches, canes or other adaptive aids to move \nabout Chelsea. Each named individual Plaintiff is a \"qualified person with a \ndisability\" as defined by the Americans With Disabilities Act, and also under \nthe Rehabilitation Act. \n  12. The Ann Arbor Center for Independent Living, Inc., (AACIL), \noperating throughout Washtenaw County, Michigan, in including in the City \nof  Chelsea,  is  a  nonprofit  Michigan  Corporation,  and  has  employees, \nvolunteers, clients and customers such as Deborah Clark and Shauna Mote, \nwho live, work or travel throughout the City of Chelsea, and could bring this \nlawsuit on their own. AACIL’s Board of Trustees and staff, composed of a \nmajority  of  people  with  disabilities,  was  created  to  assure  equality  of \nopportunity,  full  participation,  independent  living  and  economic  self-\nsufficiency  of  people  with  disabilities  by  working  to  eliminate  the \nattitudinal,  environmental,  architectural  and  communication  barriers  that \nperpetuate acts of discrimination toward people with disabilities, including \nsight  impairment  and  mobility  impairments.  The  AACIL  has  been \nadvocating for and assisting people with disabilities in Southeast Michigan \nsince  1976.  The  AACIL  has  suffered  financial  harm  and  has  diverted \nresources due to defendants’ discrimination, and it has members, clients and \n  6 \n\n2:16-cv-11546-DML-EAS   Doc # 16   Filed 08/04/16   Pg 7 of 35    Pg ID 168\nconsumers who are suffering from Defendants’ discrimination. Defendants’ \ndiscrimination frustrates the mission of AACIL and has caused it financial \nharm and has forced it to divert funds and resources. \n  13.  Each  Plaintiff  is  being  denied  access  to  Defendants’  facilities, \nprograms,  services  or  activities.  Each  Plaintiff  continues  to  suffer  from \nDefendants’ failure to make streets, roads and highways, sidewalks or other \nstreet  level  pedestrian  walkways  readily  accessible  to  and  usable  by \nPlaintiffs, and will benefit from the relief sought here.  \n  14.  Defendants  the  City  of  Chelsea,  (“Chelsea”)  the  Chelsea \nDowntown Development Authority (“DDA”), and the Michigan Department \nof Transportation (MDOT) are each public entities as that term is defined \nunder 42 U.S.C. § 12131(l); 28 C.F.R. § 35.104.  \n  15. Defendants are discriminating against Plaintiffs by denying access \nto facilities, programs, services and activities located within Chelsea. \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n16. Pursuant to Rule 23(b)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, \nthe Named Plaintiffs bring this action, for final injunctive and declaratory \nrelief  purposes  only,  on  their  own  behalf  and  on  behalf  of  all  persons \nsimilarly situated. The Named Plaintiffs seek to represent a class composed \nof all persons with mobility and/or vision disabilities who use and/or will in \n  7 \n\n2:16-cv-11546-DML-EAS   Doc # 16   Filed 08/04/16   Pg 8 of 35    Pg ID 169\nthe future use Defendants’ facilities, services, programs or activities within \nthe City of Chelsea, Michigan, The claims asserted herein are solely for final \ninjunctive  and  declaratory  relief  for  the  class;  damage  claims  are  not \nincluded in this complaint. \nA. The persons in the class are so numerous that joinder of all such \npersons is impracticable and the disposition of their claims in a class action \nis a benefit to the parties and to the Court. \nB. There is a well-defined community of interest in the questions of \nlaw and fact involved affecting the parties to be represented in that they, or \ntheir members, are all being denied, or will be denied, their civil rights of \naccess to Defendants’ facilities, services, programs or activities due to the \nbarriers described herein. \nC.  Common  questions  of  law  and  fact  predominate,  including \nquestions  raised  by  Plaintiffs’  allegations  that  Defendants  have  failed  to \nprovide  program  access  to  Defendants’  facilities,  or  have  constructed  or \naltered facilities without making the altered portions accessible according to \nlaw. \nD. The named Plaintiffs are adequate class representatives because \nthey,  or  their  members,  are  directly  impacted  by  Defendants’  failure  to \nprovide program access to Defendants’ facilities. The interests of the named \n  8 \n\n2:16-cv-11546-DML-EAS   Doc # 16   Filed 08/04/16   Pg 9 of 35    Pg ID 170\nPlaintiffs are not antagonistic to, or in conflict with, the interests of the class \nas  a  whole.  The  attorneys  representing  the  class  are  experienced  in \nrepresenting clients in class action civil rights claims. \nF. Claims of the named Plaintiffs are typical of the claims of the class \nas a whole because the Named Plaintiffs, or their members, are similarly \naffected by Defendants’ failure to provide access to Defendants’ facilities, \nservices, program or activities. \nG. Defendants have acted and/or failed to act on grounds generally \napplicable to the class as a whole, thereby making appropriate declaratory \nand final injunctive relief with respect to the class as a whole. \nH. References to Plaintiffs shall be deemed to include each named \nplaintiff and each member of the class, unless otherwise indicated. \nExamples of Individuals Plaintiffs \n  17. Plaintiff Deborah Clark recently moved to the Chelsea area. She \nuses a wheelchair and has a service dog. Within the last three years, she first \ncame to Chelsea and began to discover that she could not safely access \nChelsea’s  sidewalks,  street  crossings,  and  municipal  parking.  Also,  she \nfound  that  many  of  Chelsea’s  downtown  businesses  lack  an  accessible \nentrance.  Thus,  Plaintiff  Clark  is  segregated  from  almost  every  facility, \nservice, program or activity, including on-street parking, the parades, the \n  9 \n\n2:16-cv-11546-DML-EAS   Doc # 16   Filed 08/04/16   Pg 10 of 35    Pg ID 171\nfestivals,  and  the  library  in  Chelsea.  She  risks  her  safety  each  time  she \nattempts to use sidewalks, street crossings and municipal parking in Chelsea. \nShe constantly encounters barriers to access each time she comes to town. \n  18. Plaintiffs Shauna Mote recently tried to use the new Jackson Street \nparking lot and the driveway and new walkways connecting to the parking \nlot to Middle Street. Although the DDA built these in 2014, they are not \nreadily  accessible  to  and  usable  by  Plaintiff  Mote,  because  they  are  too \nsteep.  \n  19. Plaintiff Carlos Gray-Lion lives very close to Congdon Street. \nDuring late 2015, Chelsea altered that stretch of Congdon and the sidewalks \nadjacent. But Chelsea removed a long existing curb cut, and replaced it with \ngrass and a new curb, and stopped the project just short of a crosswalk, \nleaving an old, inaccessible curb cut on one side, and steps on the other. \n  20.  Plaintiffs  Karen  and  Merlyn  Street  have  recently  learned  that \nChelsea removed long existing curb ramps in the Wilkinson Street area, and \nreplaced them with grass and solid curbs \n  21. Annually, Defendants Chelsea and Chelsea DDA sponsor and host \nseveral festivals and two parades. Each Plaintiff has had to miss some of \nthese  events  due  to  the  lack  of  accessible  municipal  parking,  accessible \nsidewalks  and  street  crossings,  and  other  access  barriers  at  the  various \n  10 \n\n2:16-cv-11546-DML-EAS   Doc # 16   Filed 08/04/16   Pg 11 of 35    Pg ID 172\nvenues. These programs, services or activities are not readily accessible to \nand usable by Plaintiffs due in part to the lack of ADA complaint municipal \nparking, sidewalks and street crossings, including, but not limited to, along \nSR 52—Main Street. \n  22. Each Plaintiff suffers from this lack of access, as do similarly \nsituated persons with disabilities who visit Chelsea to use these facilities, or \nto participate in these programs, activities or services, or merely to visit \nfriends and shop. This is not an exhaustive, list, it is merely to illustrate the \nlack of access Plaintiffs seek to correct. \nEXAMPLES OF BARRIERS TO ACCESS \nMichigan State Route 52, Main Street, Chelsea \n  23. Throughout this Complaint, references to “Michigan State Route \n52”, “SR 52” and “Main Street” refer only to those portions that exist inside \nthe physical borders of the City of Chelsea, Michigan. \n  24.  State  Route  52  runs  uninterrupted  from  the  north  border  of \nChelsea through the south border of Chelsea. This stretch is a state trunk line \nhighway. \n  25. MDOT is responsible for the maintenance of this stretch of SR 52.  \n  26. MDOT has resurfaced this entire stretch of SR 52 from edge line \nto edge line after January 26, 1992. Some portions of the stretch have curbs. \n  11 \n\n2:16-cv-11546-DML-EAS   Doc # 16   Filed 08/04/16   Pg 12 of 35    Pg ID 173\nOn these segments, MDOT has resurfaced from curb line to curb line after \nJanuary 26, 1992. \n  27. After January 26, 1992, MDOT resurfaced this stretch of SR 52 \ninside Chelsea, but left in place one or more curbs or other barriers to an \nintersecting street level pedestrian walkway.  \n  28. After January 26, 1992, along this stretch MDOT constructed or \naltered one or more sidewalks or other street level pedestrian walkways, but \nleft in place one or more curb or other barrier to its intersection with SR 52.  \n  29. After January 26, 1992, MDOT has constructed or altered one or \nmore curb ramps or other sloped areas connecting street level pedestrian \nwalkways with SR 52 inside Chelsea. The same is true for one or more curb \nramps or other sloped areas where the sidewalks running parallel to SR 52 \ncross streets, roads or highways intersecting with SR 52. \n  30. After January 26, 1992, MDOT has granted permission to Chelsea \nto construct or alter one or more curb ramps or other sloped areas connecting \nstreet level pedestrian walkways with SR 52. The same is true for one or \nmore curb ramps or other sloped areas where the sidewalks running parallel \nto SR 52 cross streets, roads or highways intersecting with SR 52. \n  31.  After  January  26,  1992,  Chelsea  has  resurfaced  or  otherwise \naltered one or more streets intersecting with SR 52.  \n  12 \n\n2:16-cv-11546-DML-EAS   Doc # 16   Filed 08/04/16   Pg 13 of 35    Pg ID 174\n  32. Chelsea exerts jurisdiction over all sidewalks within its borders. \nChelsea’s sidewalk ordinance admits that the regulated creation and timely \nupkeep of its system of sidewalks is necessary to the successful delivery of \npublic safety services. For example, Chelsea regulates the types of items and \ndisplays individuals can place on sidewalks, mandates the removal of snow \nand  ice  from  sidewalks,  reserves  the  right  to  do  so  itself,  charging  and \ncollecting from adjacent owners for doing so. Chelsea also makes it a crime \nto obstruct sidewalks. Chelsea also demands that those who wish to occupy \nor otherwise hold events on public sidewalks to obtain a permit from the \ngovernment. This also includes the sidewalks running parallel to SR 52. \n  33. Some of the intersections along this stretch have bump-outs. Some \nof these have been constructed or altered after January 26, 1992. MDOT \nconstructed or altered some of these bump outs. MDOT granted Chelsea \npermission to construct or alter one or more of these bump outs. \n  34. There are sidewalks running parallel to both sides of SR 52 from \nits intersection with Commerce Park Drive on the south side of Chelsea \nthrough  to  just  south  of  its  intersection  with  Sibley  Road.  A  sidewalk \ncontinues running parallel to SR 52 on its east side to Hickory Drive on \nChelsea’s north end.   \n  13 \n\n2:16-cv-11546-DML-EAS   Doc # 16   Filed 08/04/16   Pg 14 of 35    Pg ID 175\n  35.  Within  the  last  three  years,  Chelsea  installed  some  pedestrian \ncross walks crossing SR 52. MDOT approved the plans for these. \n  36. When Chelsea closes SR 52 for a parade or a festival, it obtains a \npermit or other permission from MDOT prior to the closing. \n  37. MDOT is aware that there is on-street parking existing along some \nportions of SR 52 inside the City of Chelsea. MDOT has granted permission \nfor this parking. MDOT has striped these parking spaces. MDOT granted \nChelsea permission to stripe these parking spaces. After January 26, 1992, \nMDOT has resurfaced the asphalt upon which these on street parking spaces \ncurrently sit. \n  38.None of the on-street parking along SR 52 inside Chelsea is, to the \nmaximum extent feasible, readily accessible to and usable by Plaintiffs. \n  39. The majority of curb ramps crossing SR 52 suffer from one or \nmore of the following conditions: a running slope exceeding 8.33%, a cross \nslope exceeding 1:48, a top landing with slopes exceeding 1:48, changes in \nlevel exceeding ¼ inch, lips at transitions to street crossings, counter slopes \nexceeding 5%, holes or defects in the crosswalk or where the crosswalk \nmeets the curb ramp. The same is true of the curb ramps on the sidewalks \nrunning parallel to SR 52.  \n  14 \n\n2:16-cv-11546-DML-EAS   Doc # 16   Filed 08/04/16   Pg 15 of 35    Pg ID 176\n  40. In sum, the sidewalks, curb cuts and pedestrian crossings running \nparallel to and also crossing SR 52 have been constructed, resurfaced or \notherwise altered after January 26, 1992, and are not, to the maximum extent \nfeasible,  accessible  to  and  usable  by  Plaintiffs.  They  are  barriers  to \nPlaintiffs’ access. \nOther Streets and Roads inside Chelsea \n  41. During year 2015, Chelsea resurfaced Congdon Street from its \nintersection with Lincoln Street to just short of its intersection with Middle \nStreet. As a part of this project, Chelsea removed a long existing curb ramp \ncrossing Lincoln Avenue, planted grass in its place, and built  new solid \ncurbs  at  the  NW  and  NE  corners  of  the  intersection  of  Congdon  with \nLincoln.  This  alteration  created  a  lesser  level  of  accessibility  at  that \npedestrian crossing. Chelsea should never replace existing curb ramps with \ngrass and a new curb. Instead of building new curbs, Chelsea should have \ninstalled  curb  cuts  at  both  ends  of  those  pedestrian  crossings. \nhttp://www.ada.gov/dojfhwatasupplement2015.html , Q and A ## 3, 11 and \n12. In addition, Chelsea resurfaced Congdon curb to curb for the entire two \nblock  span,  but  stopped  just  short  of  the  pedestrian  crossing  of  Condon \nwhere  it  intersects  with  Middle  street,  leaving  that  pedestrian  crossing \n  15 \n\n2:16-cv-11546-DML-EAS   Doc # 16   Filed 08/04/16   Pg 16 of 35    Pg ID 177\ncompletely inaccessible. Upon information and belief, Chelsea did this to \navoid its obligation to install these two new curb cuts. Id., at # 3. \n  42.  During  2014,  Chelsea  and/or  the  DDA  completed  its  Jackson \nStreet Parking Lot project which included constructing a street from the \nparking connecting to Middle Street. These facilities violate the ADAAG \nstandards, are too steep, and are not readily accessible to and usable by \nPlaintiffs.  \n  43. Going back to January 26, 1992, Chelsea and or its DDA has \nresurfaced or altered many streets and roads, but left in place curbs or other \nbarriers to street level pedestrian walkways. Throughout the City, Plaintiffs \ncannot travel for more than a block or two without encountering non-ADA \ncompliant slopes and changes in level, and other barriers to access. \n  44. Upon information and belief, going back to January 26, 1992, \nChelsea and or its DDA has resurfaced or altered many streets and roads, \nand has built curb ramps or other sloped areas that suffer from one or more \nof the following conditions: a running slope exceeding 8.33%, a cross slope \nexceeding 1:48, a top landing with slopes exceeding 1:48, changes in level \nexceeding  ¼  inch,  lips  at  transitions  to  street  crossings,  counter  slopes \nexceeding 5%, holes or defects in the crosswalk or where the crosswalk \nmeets the curb ramp. Many of these curb ramps constitute tipping hazards. \n  16 \n\n2:16-cv-11546-DML-EAS   Doc # 16   Filed 08/04/16   Pg 17 of 35    Pg ID 178\nSidewalks and other Street Level Pedestrian Walkways inside Chelsea \n  45.  During  year  2015,  MDOT  awarded  Chelsea  a  Safe  Route  to \nSchools Grant. (“SR2S”). This was comprised of federal funds. Chelsea used \nthis grant to fill in sidewalk gaps and to upgrade ADA curb ramps along key \nschool  routes  within  the  City  limits.  The  scope  of  the  project  included, \namong  other  things,  filling  in  sidewalk  gaps  on  Wilkinson,  Wellington, \nChandler, Grant and West Old U.S. 12; installing a rapid flash, pedestrian \ncrossing on West Old U.S. 12 at Wilkinson Street, and upgrading ADA curb \nramps  and  signage  at  numerous  intersections  along  Pierce,  Madison, \nWashington, Freer, Elm, Howard and McKinley Streets. Chelsea City Staff \nconducted ongoing project inspections. As a part of this project, among other \nthings, at some intersections Chelsea removed long existing curb ramps and \nreplaced them with grass and built new solid curbs. At such places, the \nalteration resulted in a lesser level of accessibility. Chelsea altered street \nlevel pedestrian walkways but constructed new curbs and other barriers, or \nleft in place existing curbs or other barriers to an intersecting street, road or \nhighway. Also, at some intersections, Chelsea apparently limited the scope \nof the work to stop just before some pedestrian crossings, to avoid triggering \nnew, accessible curb ramps.  \n  17 \n\n2:16-cv-11546-DML-EAS   Doc # 16   Filed 08/04/16   Pg 18 of 35    Pg ID 179\n  46. Upon information and belief, going back to January 26, 1992, \nChelsea and or its DDA has resurfaced or altered other walks, sidewalks and \nother street level pedestrian walkways, but has left in place a curb or other \nbarrier to an intersection with a street , road or highway, or has built or left \nin place curb ramps or other sloped areas that suffer from one or more of the \nfollowing  conditions:  a  running  slope  exceeding  8.33%,  a  cross  slope \nexceeding 1:48, a top landing with slopes exceeding 1:48, changes in level \nexceeding  ¼  inch,  lips  at  transitions  to  street  crossings,  counter  slopes \nexceeding 5%, holes or defects in the crosswalk or where the crosswalk \nmeets the curb ramp. Many of these curb ramps constitute tipping hazards. \nChelsea’s Municipal Parking \n  47.  Throughout  Chelsea,  the  City  and/or  the  DDA  has  created, \nmaintains, regulates and operates a system of municipal parking lots and \nalso on-street parking.  \n  48. Chelsea has a system of municipal parking lots, designated by a \nletter, e.g, Parking Lot A, etc. Each of the municipal lots has one or more \ndesignated  spaces  for  persons  with  disabilities.  Each  of  these  has  been \nrestriped, resurfaced or otherwise altered after 1992. None of these are, to \nthe maximum extent feasible, readily accessible to and usable by Plaintiffs. \n28 C.F.R. 35.151(a) and (b). Each violates one or more of the measurements \n  18 \n\n2:16-cv-11546-DML-EAS   Doc # 16   Filed 08/04/16   Pg 19 of 35    Pg ID 180\nfor accessible parking spaces. For example see: www.ada.gov/restripe.pdf;  \nhttps://adata.org/factsheet/parking.  \n  49. In addition, Chelsea has created, maintains, regulates and operates \na system of municipal on-street parking. Chelsea has designated some of \nthese on street parking spaces as reserved for those with disabilities. Chelsea \nhas restriped, resurfaced or otherwise altered each of these spaces after 1992. \nAlmost all of these spaces have a surface slope exceeding 1:48. In addition, \nmany lack a clear space to deploy a ramp, and the surface to deploy the ramp \nsuffers from slopes exceeding 1:48, among other defects. As a result, these \ndesignated  on-street  parking  spaces  None  of  these  are,  to  the  maximum \nextent  feasible,  readily  accessible  to  and  usable  by  Plaintiffs.  28  C.F.R. \n35.151(a) and (b). \n  50. The City the DDA and MDOT’s provision of on-street parking is \na  “service,  program  or  activity”  of  defendants.  See  Fortyune  v  City  of \nLomita, 766 F.3d 1098, 1102-03 (9th Cir. 2014). When viewed in its entirety, \nit is not readily accessible to and usable by Plaintiffs. \n  51.  When  the  City  and  its  DDA  advertise  the  Sights  and  Sounds \nFestival, they provide a map of the municipal parking and claim that it is \nADA  accessible.  But  municipal  parking  is  not  readily  accessible  to  and \nusable by Plaintiffs. \n  19 \n\n2:16-cv-11546-DML-EAS   Doc # 16   Filed 08/04/16   Pg 20 of 35    Pg ID 181\n  51.A. Snow and ice make each of these barriers worse. At times, each \nPlaintiff has had to avoid downtown Chelsea for extended periods due to \nsnow and ice. \nDefendant Chelsea and DDA’s Festivals and Parades \n  52. Along with its other services, program and activities, Defendant \nChelsea  also  sponsors  and  otherwise  hosts  several  public  festivals  and \nParades. Some of these are: \n  A. The Chelsea Community Fair. This occurs annually in late August, \nat the Chelsea Community Fairgrounds. The fair is not fully accessible. As a \npart of the Fair, Chelsea and the DDA sponsor and host a parade, which \nbegins near Middle Street in downtown Chelsea, and proceeds down SR 52 \n(Main Street) through Chelsea to the Fairgrounds. Plaintiff Deborah Clark \nwould like to participate in the parade, or at least watch it, but has not been \nable to do so due to the lack of accessible municipal parking, sidewalks, and \nstreet crossings, complained of above. Similarly, all Plaintiffs have been and \nwill continue to be hindered from the event due to lack of access. \n  B. The Sights and Sounds Festival. Chelsea and the DDA Sponsor and \nhost this three day event, which is scheduled this year for July 28-30, 2016. \nIt has eleven stages, and a social tent, a food court, many musical acts, and \nother artist. The majority of these are located on Chelsea municipal property, \n  20 \n\n2:16-cv-11546-DML-EAS   Doc # 16   Filed 08/04/16   Pg 21 of 35    Pg ID 182\nincluding some municipal parking lots and sidewalks, and are all either on \nSR 52 or within a block of it. Because the musical acts change each year, \neach Plaintiff has a new opportunity to miss an act or multiple acts that he or \nshe may wish to see, because it is not readily accessible to and usable. Due \nto the lack of accessible municipal parking and the inaccessible sidewalks \nthroughout  Chelsea,  this  service,  program  or  activity  is  inaccessible  to \nPlaintiffs.  \n  C.  Sights  and  Sounds  on  Thursday  Nights:  Chelsea  and  the  DDA \nSponsor  and  host  this  program,  service  or  activity  for  two  hours  each \nThursday night for approximately eleven weeks. It uses the same stages as \nthose for the Sights and Sounds Festival, and has all of the barriers to access \nas listed above. Because the musical acts change each Thursday night and \neach year, each Plaintiff has a new opportunity to miss an act he or she may \nwish to see, because it is not readily accessible to and usable. \n  D. The Hometown Holiday Festival: Chelsea and the DDA sponsor \nand host this service, program or activity, each December. Likewise, it is \nheld in downtown Chelsea, and the lack of accessible municipal parking and \naccessible sidewalks make it inaccessible to Plaintiffs. \n  53. Many of the Plaintiffs know each other. Each Plaintiff’s residence \nis fully accessible, but it operates as an oasis, due to the fact that the nearby \n  21 \n\n2:16-cv-11546-DML-EAS   Doc # 16   Filed 08/04/16   Pg 22 of 35    Pg ID 183\npedestrian crossings, sidewalks and other street level pedestrian walkways, \nand  other  services,  programs  and  activities  each  suffer  from  the  defects \ndescribed herein. Each Plaintiff is hampered from inviting other Plaintiffs \nand similarly situated friends from joining them in exercising or otherwise \nparticipating in everything others take for granted throughout Chelsea.  \n  54. And, snow and ice make each of these barriers to access worse. \nEach Plaintiff has had to avoid downtown Chelsea for extended periods due \nto  snow  and  ice on  the  sidewalks,  curb  ramps  and  street  crossings,  and \nmunicipal  parking.  Defendants’  plowing  operations  and  property  owners \nneed training in how to avoid these barriers to access. \n  55.  Summary  of  Examples  of  Defendants’  Discrimination.  The \nabove examples are not exhaustive. Rather, they are illustrations of several \nof  policies  followed  by  each  Defendant,  that,  taken  together,  render \nDefendants’  facilities,  services,  programs  and  activities,  when  viewed  in \ntheir entirely, not readily accessible to and usable by Plaintiffs and class \nmembers. Without Court intervention to correct Defendants’ discrimination, \nthese will remain not readily accessible to and usable by Plaintiffs and class \nmembers. \nVI. CAUSES OF ACTION \n \n  22 \n\n2:16-cv-11546-DML-EAS   Doc # 16   Filed 08/04/16   Pg 23 of 35    Pg ID 184\nFIRST CAUSE OF ACTION: CLASS-WIDE FINAL INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \nCLAIM UNDER TITLE II OF THE AMERICANS WITH \nDISABILITIES ACT \n \n56. Plaintiffs incorporate by reference the allegations of paragraphs 1 \nthrough  55  above,  inclusive.  Plaintiffs  bring  this  count  for  class-wide \ndeclaratory and final injunctive relief, but not money damages, under Title II \nof the Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA). \n  57. Title II of the ADA prohibits covered public entities from denying \nindividuals with disabilities “the benefits of ” any “program” or “activity” or \n“service[]” of a covered entity on the basis of disability. 42 U.S.C. 12132. \nAs  the  Supreme  Court  has  recognized,  those  statutory  terms  are \nunambiguously broad. See Pennsylvania Dep’t of Corr. v. Yeskey, 524 U.S. \n206, 212 (1998). Section 504 specifically provides that “the term ‘program \nor activity’ means all of the operations of  ” a covered public entity, 29 \nU.S.C.  794(b)  (emphasis  added),  and  Congress  required  Title  II  to  be \ninterpreted at least as broadly as Section 504, see 42 U.S.C. 12201(a).  \n  58. Among other things, Title II of the Americans With Disabilities Act \nrequires that when a public entity builds or alters1 any part of a facility after \nJanuary 26, 1992, it shall, to the maximum extent possible, be altered so that \n                                                      \n1 Throughout this document “alter, altered, or alteration” have the definition \nset forth in Joint Technical Assistance July 2013 and its Supplemental Q \nand A January 2015. These are available at on the USDOJ website as  \nhttp://www.ada.QOv/doj-fhwa-ta-supplement-201S.htm I.\n \n  23 \n\n2:16-cv-11546-DML-EAS   Doc # 16   Filed 08/04/16   Pg 24 of 35    Pg ID 185\nit  is  readily  accessible  to  and  usable by  individuals  with  disabilities. 42 \nU.S.C. §§ 12132; 28 C.F.R. § 35.151(a), (b) & (i). This includes, among \nother things, resurfacing or other alterations of Defendants’ roads and walks. \nAbility Center, 385 F.3d 913-914; Frame v. City of Arlington, 657 F.3d 215 \n(5th Cir. 2011); Kinney v. Yerusalim, 9 F.3d 1067 (3rd Cir.1993)(cert. denied \nsub nom Hoskins v. Kinney, 114 S.Ct. 1545, 128 L.Ed.2d 196 (1994). Many \nof defendants’ roads, walks and parking lots at issue in this lawsuit have \nbeen “altered” after 1991 “by, on behalf of, or for the use” of each of the \nDefendants”, but are not “to the maximum extent possible readily usable by \nand  accessible  to”  Plaintiffs.  Id.  Indeed,  as  set  forth  in  the  facts  above, \nDefendants’ street level transit stops, pedestrian crossings, sidewalks and \nother street level pedestrian walkways deny access to Plaintiffs. And, each \naltered walk, road and curb cut must meet the ADA Standards. 28 C.F.R. § \n35.151(c). By altering sidewalks and other street level pedestrian walkways \nwithout making them, to the maximum extent feasible, accessible to and \nusable  by  Plaintiffs,  each  Defendant  violates  the  ADA.  Ability  Center, \nsupra, Kinney, supra, and Frame, supra. \n  59. Title II regulations promulgated by the Department of Justice state \nthat  “[n]o  qualified  individual  with  a  disability  shall,  on  the  basis  of \ndisability, * * * be denied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities \n  24 \n\n2:16-cv-11546-DML-EAS   Doc # 16   Filed 08/04/16   Pg 25 of 35    Pg ID 186\nof  a public  entity.”  28 C.F.R.  35.130. As  stated  herein,  Defendants’  are \nproviding services, programs or activities that, when viewed in their entirety, \nare not readily accessible to and usable by Plaintiffs. As the Sixth Circuit \nrecently stated: \nThe conclusion that sidewalks may qualify as a service is supported \nby a 2004 decision from this court, a Title II implementing regulation, \nand the Justice Department's amicus briefs in several sidewalk cases. \n \nBabcock v Michigan, 812 F.3d 531, 543 (6th Cir. 2016) (Rogers, concurring). \n“The agency's interpretation of its own regulations is entitled to substantial \ndeference.” Id., at 544. \n60.  As  the  Department  of  Justice  has  stated,  the  curb  ramp \nrequirements  in  the  Title  II  regulations  were  premised  on  the  view  that \n“maintenance  of  pedestrian  walkways  by  public  entities  is  a  covered \nprogram.” 60 Fed. Reg. 58,462 (1995) (notice of proposed rulemaking). That \nposition, embodied in the Department of Justice’s regulations implementing \nTitle  II,  is  entitled  to  substantial deference.  See  Chevron  U.S.A.,  Inc.  v. \nNatural Res. Def. Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 844 (1984).   \n  61.  Moreover,  in  subsequent  legislation,  Congress  has  explicitly \nrecognized that “public sidewalks” are covered by Title II. Section 1108 of \nthe Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century, Pub. L. No. 105-178, \n112 Stat. 107 (23 U.S.C. 133(b)(3)), which was passed in 1998, authorizes \n  25 \n\n2:16-cv-11546-DML-EAS   Doc # 16   Filed 08/04/16   Pg 26 of 35    Pg ID 187\nthe  use  of  federal  funds  set  aside  for  transportation  improvements \nundertaken by the States for “the modification of public sidewalks to comply \nwith the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990.” \n  62. Providing and maintaining a network of walkways for pedestrians \nto get around town is a quintessential, not to mention ages old, government \nservice. A city’s provision and maintenance of sidewalks, curbs, on-street \nparking  and  parking  lots  clearly  constitute  a  “service[],  program[],  or \nactivit[y],” 42 U.S.C. 12132, under Title II of the ADA. As the Ninth Circuit \nheld in Barden, “maintenance of public sidewalks * * * is a normal function \nof a municipal entity.” Barden v. City of Sacramento, 292 F.3d 1073, 1077 \n(9th Cir. 2002), cert. denied, 539 U.S. 958 (2003) (sidewalks are a service, \nprogram or activity for purposes of the ADA, and are a service or program \nfor purposes of Section 504). And, as the Supreme Court has recognized in \nanother  context,  the  provision  of  sidewalks  is  an  archetypal  “general \ngovernment service[].” Everson v. Board of Educ., 330 U.S. 1, 17-18 (1947) \n(noting that there is no Establishment Clause difficulty in giving churches \naccess  to  “such  general  government  services  as  ordinary  police  and  fire \nprotection,  connections  for  sewage  disposal,  public  highways  and \nsidewalks”).  Sidewalks  permit  the  public  not  only  to  stay  clear  of  road \ntraffic, but to access shops and businesses, means of public transportation, \n  26 \n\n2:16-cv-11546-DML-EAS   Doc # 16   Filed 08/04/16   Pg 27 of 35    Pg ID 188\nplaces of employment, and government offices and facilities. And for “time \nout of mind,” sidewalks have been used for the purpose of public association \nand speech. Boos v. Barry, 485 U.S. 312, 318 (1988) (quoting Hague v. \nCIO, 307 U.S. 496, 515 (1939) (opinion of Roberts, J.)).  \n  63. Likewise, the City, the DDA and MDOT’s provision of on-street \nparking is a “service, program or activity” of defendants. See Fortyune, 766 \nF.3d 1102-03. None of these parking spaces is accessible to Plaintiffs. When \nviewed in its entirety, it is not readily accessible to and usable by Plaintiffs.  \n64.  After  constructing  or  altering  a facility,  each  Defendant “shall \nmaintain in operable working condition those features of facilities that are \nrequired to be readily accessible to and usable by persons with disabilities by \nthe Act.” 28 C.F.R. § 35.133. Facilities required to be accessible include \nroads, walks, passageways and parking lots. 28 C.F.R. § 35.104. As set forth \nherein, each Defendant routinely fails to do this.  \n65. Defendants’ conduct in failing to maintain accessible facilities by \nfailing  to  replace  crumbling  and  uneven  pavement,  remove  protruding \nand/or  moveable  obstructions,  ensure  a  sufficiently  wide  path  of  travel, \ncorrect excessive cross-slopes and running slopes on roads and walks, failing \nto timely remove snow and ice, failing to remove gravel and other detritus \nfrom  walks  and  curb  ramps,  and  failing  to provide  compliant  accessible \n  27 \n\n2:16-cv-11546-DML-EAS   Doc # 16   Filed 08/04/16   Pg 28 of 35    Pg ID 189\nstreet level transit stops thus constitutes unlawful discrimination on the basis \nof disability in violation of Title II of the ADA. \n66. Each defendant is denying Plaintiffs participation in the services, \nprograms  or  activities  of  on-street  parking,  parades,  festivals  and  the \ncommunity  fair  due  to  lack  of  access  to  them.  Applying  the  general \nprohibition to facilities, the regulations provide that no one with a covered \ndisability “shall, because a public entity’s facilities are inaccessible to or \nunusable by individuals with disabilities, be excluded from participation in, \nor be denied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities of a public \nentity.” 28 C.F.R. 35.149. And the regulations expressly define “facility” to \ninclude “roads” and “walks” controlled by a public entity. 28 C.F.R. 35.104.  \n  67. Each Defendant is violating Title II’s access requirements set forth \nin  28  C.F.R.  §  149  (the  general  prohibition  against  discrimination);  28 \nC.F.R. § 150 (requiring accessibility of facilities existing prior to January 26, \n1992, the effective date of Title II); and, 28 C.F.R. § 151 (requiring that \nfacilities  newly  constructed  or  altered  after  January  26,  1992  be  fully \naccessible).  \n  68. Defendants’ inaccessible parking, sidewalks and street crossings \nstop  Plaintiffs  from  participating  in  Defendants’  services,  programs  or \nactivities, such as municipal parking lots, on-street parking, yearly parades, \n  28 \n\n2:16-cv-11546-DML-EAS   Doc # 16   Filed 08/04/16   Pg 29 of 35    Pg ID 190\nfestivals, fairs and the like, as well as a lack of an accessible route to and \nfrom the Courthouse, Police Station, City Hall, Post Office and Secretary of \nState’s offices. \n69.  Defendants'  conduct  constitutes  an  ongoing  and  continuous \nviolation of the ADA and unless restrained from doing so, Defendants will \ncontinue to violate the ADA. Said conduct, unless enjoined, will continue to \ninflict  injuries  for  which  Plaintiffs  have  no  adequate  remedy  at  law. \nConsequently,  Plaintiffs  are  entitled  to  final  injunctive  relief  pursuant  to \nsection 308 of the ADA 42 U.S.C. § 12188, and reasonable attorneys fees. \nSECOND CAUSE OF ACTION:  \nCLASS-WIDE CLAIM UNDER THE REHABILITATION ACT OF 1973 \n \n  70. Plaintiffs incorporate by reference the allegations of paragraphs 1 \nthrough 69, above, inclusive. Plaintiffs bring this count pursuant to Section \n504  of  the  Rehabilitation  Act  (RA)  for  class-wide  declaratory  and  final \ninjunctive relief, but not monetary relief.  \n  71. Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (RA) prohibits covered public \nentities  from  denying  individuals  with disabilities  “the benefits of  ” any \n“program” or “activity” of a covered entity on the basis of disability. 29 \nU.S.C. 794(a). As the Supreme Court has recognized, those statutory terms \nare unambiguously broad. See Yeskey, 524 U.S. 206, 212 (1998). Section \n504 specifically provides that “the term ‘program or activity’ means all of \n  29 \n\n2:16-cv-11546-DML-EAS   Doc # 16   Filed 08/04/16   Pg 30 of 35    Pg ID 191\nthe operations of  ” a covered public entity, 29 U.S.C. 794(b) (emphasis \nadded).  \n  72. The RA provides that \"[n]o otherwise qualified individual with a \ndisability  in  the  United  States  ...  shall,  solely  by  reason  of  her  or  his \ndisability, be excluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or \nbe  subjected  to  discrimination  under  any  program  or  activity  receiving \nFederal financial assistance.” 29 U.S.C. § 794(a) (Section 504 of the RA).  \n  73. The RA defines “program or activity” as “all of the operations of” a \nqualifying  local  government.  29  U.S.C.  §  794(B)(1)(A).  This  includes \nDefendants’ sidewalks, other street level pedestrian walkways, transit stops \nand  on-street  parking.  Barden,  supra;  Ability  Center,  supra;  Frame, \nFortyune, supra. \n  74.  The  RA  also  mandates  each  Defendant  to  make  each  “facility” \naccessible according to law. “The regulations define ‘facility’ as including \n‘roads, walks, [and] parking lots.’ 28 C.F.R. § 39.103.” Ability Center, 385 \nF.3rd 911, n. 10. \n  75. Upon information and belief, at all times relevant, each Defendant \nhas received federal financial assistance, which each has spent on one or \nmore of the alteration projects complained of herein.  \n  30 \n\n2:16-cv-11546-DML-EAS   Doc # 16   Filed 08/04/16   Pg 31 of 35    Pg ID 192\n  76.  Each  plaintiff  (1)  has  a  disability;  (2)  is  and  has  been  otherwise \nqualified  to  participate  in  Defendants’  federally  funded  programs  or \nactivities; and (3) was denied the benefits of the programs or activities or \nwas otherwise subject to discrimination because of his or her disability.2  \n  77.  As  detailed  above,  beginning  with  the  effective  date  of  the \nRehabilitation Act, and continuing each year to the present, each Defendant \nhas received federal money but has spent it engaging in a continuing pattern \nand  practice  of  over-arching  discrimination  against  Plaintiffs  and  class \nmembers by denying the benefits of, or subjecting them to discrimination \nunder several programs or activities receiving Federal financial assistance.   \n  78. Plaintiffs are entitled to declaratory relief, to final injunctive relief \nordering each Defendant to bring these facilities, programs or activities into \ncompliance, and Plaintiffs reasonable attorneys fees and costs.  \nCOUNT THREE: \nMICHIGAN PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES CIVIL RIGHTS ACT \n \n79. Plaintiffs incorporate by reference the allegations of paragraphs 1 \nthrough  78  above,  inclusive.  Plaintiffs  do  not  bring  this  claim  against \nMDOT. Plaintiffs bring this count for declaratory and final injunctive relief, \n                                                      \n2 Although the Rehab Act—passed in 1973—uses the term “handicapped”, \nCongress in the late 1980s stopped using this term because “individuals with \ndisabilities find the term ‘handicapped’ objectionable.” Helen L. v. Didario, \n46 F.3d 325, 333 n8 (3rd Cir. 1995).  \n \n  31 \n\n2:16-cv-11546-DML-EAS   Doc # 16   Filed 08/04/16   Pg 32 of 35    Pg ID 193\nbut not for monetary damages,  solely against defendant City of Chelsea and \ndefendant  Chelsea  DDA.  The  above  complained  of  failure by  these two \ndefendants  to  construct,  alter  and  maintain  their  services,  programs  or \nactivities to be accessible to Plaintiffs violates Michigan law at M.C.L. § \n37.1301-02. Plaintiffs are entitled to final injunctive and declaratory relief, \nattorney fees and costs. \n80.  The  Michigan  Persons  with  Disabilities  Civil  Rights  Act \n(PWDCRA) is built upon similar policy objective and legal standards as the \nADA,  and  the  ADA  and  PWDCRA  \"substantially  mirror\"  each  other. \nDonald v. Sybra, Inc., 667 F.3d 757, 764 (6th Cir. 2012). Therefore, \"claims \nunder  both  statutes  are  generally  analyzed  identically.\"  Steward  v.  New \nChrysler, 415 Fed.Appx. 632, 641 (6th Cir.2011).   \n81.  Defendants  Chelsea  and  Chelsea  DDA  are  a  “public  service” \nsubject to the PWDCRA’s Article 3. MCL 37.1301(b). Each Plaintiff has “a \ndisability” as defined in the statute. MCL 37.1103(d)(i)(B). Further, just as \nwith  the  ADA’s  “qualified  individual  with  a  disability”  provision,  each \nPlaintiff’s disability is “unrelated” to his or her ability to utilize and benefit \nfrom the city streets, pedestrian walkways and street level transit stops, with \nthe accommodation their mobility devices. MCL 37.1103(l). \n82. The PWDCRA provides that a public service cannot: \n  32 \n\n2:16-cv-11546-DML-EAS   Doc # 16   Filed 08/04/16   Pg 33 of 35    Pg ID 194\nDeny an individual the full and equal enjoyment of the goods, \nservices, facilities, privileges, advantages, and accommodations \nof a . . . public service because of a disability that is unrelated to \nthe individual’s ability to utilize and benefit from the goods, \nservices, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations \nor because of the use by any individual of adaptive devices or \naids. \n \n83. MCL 37.1302(a). Each Defendant’s streets, pedestrian crossings, \nstreet level pedestrian walkways, transit stops, municipal parking lots and \non-street parking, parades, festivals and community fair are “services and \nfacilities” of each Defendant. “Facilities include roads and walks”. 28 C.F.R. \n§ 35.104.” Ability Center, 385 F.3rd 904, n. 3. Also see, Barden; Frame, \nsupra. “The public streets [and sidewalks and other street level pedestrian \nwalkways]  involved  in  this  case  are  plainly  ‘services,’  ‘facilities,’  and \n‘advantages,’ provided and regulated by [each] Defendant.” Bertrand v. City \nof Mackinac Island, 256 Mich App 13; 662 NW2d 77 (2003)(analyzing the \nPWDCRA’s duties to pedestrians with disabilities). \n84.  Defendants  Chelsea  and  Chelsea  DDA  have  violated  the \nPWDCRA by denying each Plaintiff the full and equal enjoyment of the \nstreets, sidewalks and other pedestrian walkways despite Plaintiffs’ ability to \nuse and benefit from these if provided with the accommodation required by \nthe statute. MCL 37.1102(2). \n  33 \n\n2:16-cv-11546-DML-EAS   Doc # 16   Filed 08/04/16   Pg 34 of 35    Pg ID 195\n85. Plaintiffs are entitled to declaratory relief, to final injunctive relief \nordering these two Defendants to bring these services, programs or activities \ninto compliance, and Plaintiffs reasonable attorneys fees and costs. \nVII. PRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs pray for relief as follows: \n \nA. An final injunctive order and judgment enjoining each Defendant \nfrom  violating  the  Americans  with  Disabilities  Act,  Section  504  of  the \nRehabilitation  Act,  and  Defendants  Chelsea  and  Chelsea  DDA  from \nviolating Michigan’s Persons with Disabilities Civil Rights Act;  \nB.  A  final  declaration  that  the  services,  programs,  activities  and \nfacilities listed herein under the jurisdiction of Defendants, including the \nstreets, roads and highways, street level transit stops, sidewalks, and other \nstreet  level  pedestrian  walkways,  are  constructed,  designed,  and/or \nmaintained in a manner which discriminates against Plaintiffs and which \nfails to provide program access for persons with disabilities as required by \nlaw; \nC.  An  final  injunction  ordering  Defendants  to  correct  the  access \nbarriers according to law; \nD. Plaintiffs’ reasonable attorneys' fees, litigation expenses, and costs; \n            E. Such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper \n  34 \n\n2:16-cv-11546-DML-EAS   Doc # 16   Filed 08/04/16   Pg 35 of 35    Pg ID 196\nRespectfully submitted,\n.Mark Finnegan (P68050)\nDenise M.
