    "summary": "<p><strong>Facts</strong></p>\r\n<p>Turning Point USA (TPUSA) is a conservative organization that publishes profiles of progressive college professors, potentially to harass them. Outsiders, including the two professors, characterize TPUSA as a hate group with ties to white supremacy. Tennessee Tech University (TTU) has a chapter of TPUSA. On February 4, 2021, after witnessing the TTU TPUSA faculty advisor, also a professor, celebrate a local school's decision to maintain \"the Redskins\" as their mascot, the two professors put up <a href=\"../../../../doc/135772/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a flier</a> on campus accusing the faculty advisor of racism.</p>\r\n<p>After the faculty advisor complained, TTU's Human Resources department, in conjunction with a staff member from the Office of Research and Economic Development and one from the office of Finance and Planning, conducted an investigation. The investigation concluded that the two professors had violated TTU's Code of Conduct, which mandates, among other things, \"integrity and objectivity\" through conduct that is \"in good faith,\" \"in accordance with the highest ethical and professional standards,\" and that \"promotes academic freedom . . . and respect for all faculty.\" TTU's Policy 007 also requires that faculty not suppress others' ideas, even if those ideas are widely viewed as offensive or wrong. Following the HR investigation, the Provost of TTU punished the professors by making them ineligible for (1) positions as faculty advisors to student organizations, (2) study abroad activities, (3) non-instructional faculty assignments, and (4) salary increases for a year. Additionally, they were required to meet with the Dean at the start of each semester on the topic of not bringing personal grievances into the workplace, and to complete sensitivity training. The sanctions were set to last through Spring of 2023.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Lawsuit</strong></p>\r\n<p>The professors, represented by private counsel, sued TTU in U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee on October 5, 2021. They alleged under 42 U.S.C. 1983 that (1) TTU had violated their First Amendment rights by retaliating against them for constitutionally protected speech and (2) that TTU had violated the Fourteenth Amendment by denying them due process. They requested declaratory relief, a permanent injunction prohibiting TTU from similarly violating the rights in the future, removal of the Provost's punishments, attorney's fees, or other equitable relief like monetary losses.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Although the plaintiff professors originally named the Provost, the Board of Trustees, and three staff members who had investigated the allegations as defendants, later, on November 19, 2021, plaintiffs requested and were granted a dismissal without prejudice of all the investigatory defendants. Accordingly, on November 29, 2021, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint removing the investigators but adding the president of TTU, who had decided that any TTU employees who had been disciplined were not eligible for a normal $1,000 bonus. On December 7, 2021, the Board of Trustees and the President moved to dismiss the actions against them, both claiming qualified immunity and that U.S.C. 1983 applies only to \"persons,\" which courts have defined to exclude the state and officials acting in their official capacities. In their December 20, 2021 response, the plaintiffs agreed that the Board of Trustees should be dismissed.</p>\r\n<p>On January 26, 2022, Judge Waverly D. Crenshaw, Jr. dismissed the Board of Trustees and the President as defendants in the case, leaving only the Provost. On June 2, 2022, the plaintiffs added a request for a preliminary injunction. On September 28, 2022, the plaintiffs filed for summary judgment. The Provost cross-motioned for summary judgment in her favor on September 30, 2022. On October 4, 2022, the mediator reported that the parties met for mediation on September 22, 2022, but the case did not settle.</p>\r\n<p>On December 1, 2022 Judge Crenshaw closed the case by denying the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment, granting the Provost's motion for summary judgment, and denying the preliminary injunction. 643 F.Supp.3d 824. On the First Amendment claims, she applied settled tests for public employees in school settings attempting to establish First Amendment retaliation: she reasoned that the plaintiffs had met their burdens to show that their speech had some elements of constitutionally protected speech, since the professors were hybrid private citizens and public employees speaking on a matter of public concern, that the action against them had been adverse enough to chill their speech, and that the Provost had disciplined the professors because of their speech (not merely their conduct). However, despite success in these areas of the test, she ultimately found the speech unprotected under a balancing test that asked whether the professor's interest in their First Amendment speech outweighed their employer's interest in public service efficiency. She recognized that university professors had a large interest in free speech, but found that the school's interest in building a collegial academic community where everyone was able to speak freely, reinforced by discipline, outweighed the professor's interest.</p>\r\n<p>The Provost had also asserted qualified immunity, which would shield her from liability unless the plaintiffs put forth analogous case law showing that he violated \"clearly defined rights.\" The Judge rejected the plaintiff's two attempts at analogy and held that they could not show that any reasonable person in the Provost's position would know it was unconstitutional to discipline them.</p>\r\n<p>Last, the Judge rejected the plaintiff's due process claims, saying they had no cognizable property entitlement in auxiliary teaching function privileges like teaching abroad. She also found that the procedure had been adequate to confer due process: the Provost made a considered decision, relied on thorough investigations, and conducted some interviews herself. Although her rejection of the plaintiff's appeal of her decision was short, that was not a due process violation.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Appeal</strong></p>\r\n<p>On December 16, 2022, the plaintiff-professors filed an appeal against the Provost and President of TTU in the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals. The Provost and President's brief is not due until March 1, 2023.</p>",

LORI BRUCE,  )\nin her official and individual capacity,  ) \n)\nDefendant.  )\nMEMORANDUM OPINION\nAn internecine difference of opinion among academics at Tennessee Tech University (โTTUโ\nor โTechโ) led to this action under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 asserting First Amendment retaliation and\nFourteenth Amendment due process claims.  The case arose after two faculty members were\ndisciplined by the Provost for distributing flyers on campus that labeled another faculty member a\nracist.  Now before the Court are fully-briefed Cross-Motions for Summary Judgment.  (Doc. Nos.\n60, 61, 62, 65-71, 78-83, 84, 87, 88).1  For the reasons that follow, the Defendantโs Motion for\n1  The sheer volume of filings prompts two observations. First, the number of filings is due largely\nto Defendant filing two Motions for Summary Judgment, one in her individual capacity and the other in her\nofficial capacity.  The filings relating to both motions are virtually (if not) identical, including the\nmemoranda in support (Doc. Nos. 80-1, 81-1), the responses and replies (Doc. Nos. 82, 83, 87, 88), and the\nstatements of facts and responses (67, 68, 82, 83).  Additionally, the same 22 exhibits spanning more than\n1600 pages are filed twice.  This is a first for the Court and entirely unnecessary.  Defendant could have\nsimply filed one motion and one memorandum that incorporated both her individual and  official capacity\narguments particularly because her qualified immunity argument is only 2ยฝ pages long (Doc. No. 66 at 28-\n30), and leave of Court was given to file those extra pages.  (Doc. No. 70).\nSecond, the Local Rules provide that reply briefs โshall not exceed five (5) pages without leave of\nCourt.โ L.R. 7.01(A)(4).  It is not lost on the Court that, while Defendantโs two replies are exactly 5 pages\nlong, this is only because each contains an identical, single-space, small font, footnote that begins on page\none, takes up the majority of page two, and concludes on page three. Counsel are reminded that it is\nincumbent upon them โto follow the letter โ if not the spiritโ of the rules. Nash v. Comm'r of Soc. Sec.\nAdmin., No. 3:20-CV-00908, 2022 WL 1174096, at *2 (M.D. Tenn. Apr. 20, 2022).\nCase 2:21-cv-00039   Document 90   Filed 12/01/22   Page 1 of 27 PageID #: 8913\n\nSummary Judgment will be granted and Plaintiffsโ Motion will be denied. \nI.  Factual Background2\nDr. Julia Gruber is a tenured Associate Professor of German at TTU, while Mr. Andrew\nSmith is a tenured Instructor in the Department of English at that institution.  (PSOF ยถยถ 1, 2).  Dr.\nLori Bruce is the Provost at TTU and Vice President for Academic Affairs.    (Doc. No. 56-9, Bruce\nDep. at 22).\nIn 2021, a student chapter of Turning Point USA (โTPUSAโ) was established at TTU. \nTPUSA s is a national organization with a presence at many college campuses across the United\nStates.  It came to TTU after Gittle Sciolis, a student at the school, filed a petition to make TPUSA\na student club.  Ms. Sciolis has described the club  as a โconservative organization for college\nstudents [and] high school studentsโ with a mission โto spread conservative ideas.โ (PSOF ยถยถ 17-19). \nFor their part, Plaintiffs believe that TPUSA is a racist organization and โnational hate groupโ with\nโties  to  white  supremacy.โ    (Id.  ยถ  20).  Dr.  Andrew  Donadio  (โDr.  Donadioโ),  a  County\nCommissioner and an Assistant Professor of Nursing, serves as TPUSAโs faculty advisor at TTTU.\n(Id. ยถ 3).\nOn February 4, 2021, the Putnam County School Board held a meeting to consider whether\na committee should be appointed to look into the issue of whether Algood Middle Schoolโs mascot\nshould be renamed from โRedskinsโ to something else.  (Id. ยถ 4). Dr. Gruber attended the meeting\nwith some friends, including Sayota Knight, who Plaintiffs claim is Native American. (Id. ยถ 5).\n2  The following facts are drawn from Plaintiffsโ Statement of Undisputed Facts (โPSOFโ) (Doc. No.\n62) and Defendantโs Response (Doc. No. 79) thereto, as well as from Defendantโs Statement of Undisputed\nFacts (โDSOFโ) (Doc. No. 71) and Plaintiffsโ Response thereto (Doc. No. 72). Contrary to what those\nlengthy documents might suggest and Defendantโs penchant for picking apart virtually every statement made\nby Plaintiffs, the important and relevant facts are not in much dispute.\n2\nCase 2:21-cv-00039   Document 90   Filed 12/01/22   Page 2 of 27 PageID #: 8914\n\nDr. Donadio also attended the meeting.  Even though he understood that some people found\nโRedskinsโ to be a racial slur, he cheered and applauded when the Board voted against forming a\ncommittee to determine whether the โRedskinsโ mascot should be retired.  (Id. ยถยถ 9, 10).  Witnessing\nDr. Donadioโs enthusiastic support for the Boardโs decision, Dr. Gruber was โshockedโ and\nโoffended.โ  (Id. ยถ 12).  She also felt that Dr. Donadioโs behavior was โintimidatingโ to her Native\nAmerican friend because it was โracist.โ  (DSOF ยถ 4).\nThat same evening, Dr. Gruber contacted Mr. Smith by Facebook Messenger, and informed\nhim about what she had witnessed.  Upon hearing Dr. Donadioโs reaction, Mr. Smith, too, became\nupset and dismayed. (PSOF ยถ 13). \nDr. Donadioโs reaction to the Boardโs decision to shelf the issue about renaming the\nโRedskins,โ coupled with his role as the faculty advisor to TPUSA, incensed Plaintiffs and prompted\nMr. Smith to create the flyer that is at the heart of this lawsuit.  Before discussing that flyer and its\naftermath, a little background about TPUSA and its arrival at TTU is appropriate.\nAs noted, Plaintiffs view TPUSA as a racist organization with โa history of political and\nracial controversyโ surrounding it.  (Id. ยถ 27).  They point out that โ[b]efore TPUSA had an official\nstudent chapter at TTU, in the fall of 2019, TPUSA co-sponsored a campus event with the College\nRepublicans  in  which  an  advertisement  was  made  for  a  debate  watch  party,  featuring\n(then-Presidential Candidate) Senator Elizabeth Warren dressed up in Native American dress,\nalongside derogatory comments.โ  (Id. ). \nTPUSAโs intention to establish a chapter at TTU was disconcerting to some and received\nsignificant push-back. One concern was that the organization has a Professor Watchlist website,\nwhich publishes profiles of college professors, and has the stated mission to โexpose and document\n3\nCase 2:21-cv-00039   Document 90   Filed 12/01/22   Page 3 of 27 PageID #: 8915\n\ncollege professors who discriminate against conservative students and advance leftist propaganda\nin the classroom.โ  (Id. ยถ 23). Provost Bruce viewed the watchlist as โan effort to single out\nindividuals for the purpose of harassing them.โ  (Id. ยถ 24).  Indeed, she and other academics had\nexpressed concerns about  how a professor would end up on the watchlist even before the\norganization arrived on campus.  (Id. ยถ 25).  \nThe idea of maintaining a watchlist seemingly played into a portion of the flyer created by\nMr. Smith.  That flyer begins by stating:  \nThis racist college professor thought it would be a great idea to help start a Tennessee\nTech chapter for this national hate group, where racist students can unite to harass,\nthreaten, intimidate, and terrorize persons of color, feminists, liberals, and the like,\nespecially their teachers. Their organization created a national โProfessor Watchlistโ\nto  harass  and  intimidate  progressive  educators,  including  many  women,\nAfrican-American, and Muslim professors.\nThis statement is followed by a large picture of Dr. Donadio sitting in a chair. After the picture, the\nflyer concludes with the following text:\nProfessor Donadio and Turning Point USA. You are on our list. \nYour hate & hypocrisy are not welcome at Tennessee Tech. \nNo Unity With Racists. Hate Speech Is Not Free Speech.\n(Doc. No. 52-4).3 The flyer was created by Mr. Smith at home using his own personal software. \n(PSOF ยถ 33).\nAround 3:30 p.m. on February 5, 2021, Dr. Gruber placed a handful of flyers in the lounge,\nthe auditorium (where Dr. Donadio sometimes taught classes), the kitchen, and in common areas of\nBell Hall. (DSOF ยถ 8).  Frank Sterling, an IT employee at the school found at least some of those\n3  A copy of the flyer is attached hereto as โExhibit A.โ\n4\nCase 2:21-cv-00039   Document 90   Filed 12/01/22   Page 4 of 27 PageID #: 8916\n\nflyers and collected them.  (PSOF ยถ 36; DSOF ยถยถ 10, 11).  He also sent a picture of the flyer to Dr.\nDonadio who, in turn, sent it to Ms. Sciolis.  (PSOF ยถ 39).  Dr. Donadio reported the incident to the\nUniversity Police Department, and a police report was written that same day, listing the โincident\ntypeโ as โharassment.โ  (Doc. No. 72-2 at 183).  \nThe next afternoon at around 1:20, Mr. Smith posted a flyer in the Roaden University Center\n(โRUCโ).  (PSOF ยถ 37).  Two days later, on February 8, 2021, the flyer was seen by Reece Arnold,\na student, and reported to campus police, who then removed it. (Id.ยถ 41).\nThe record suggests that the flyer was not seen by many others and there is nothing to suggest\nthat classes at TTU were canceled or rescheduled as a result of the flyer.  (Id. ยถยถ 44-45). \nNevertheless, and even though he would later tell the media that he was an elected official and could\nโtake the heat,โ Dr. Donadio filed a formal complaint on February 9, 2021 with TTUโs Office of\nHuman Resources against Dr. Gruber and Mr. Smith.  (Doc. No. 62-14 at 2; PSOF ยถ 56).   Both were\nnotified of Dr. Donadioโs complaint on February 24, 2021.  (PSOF ยถ 48).\nAn investigation was conducted by Greg Holt, Compliance Officer and Interim Associate\nVice President of Human Resources.  (Doc. No. 80-8 at 2).  His investigation lasted until April 14,\n2021.  (Id.).  \nOn April 25, 2021, Dr. Donadio and Ms. Sciolis gave an interview on the Fox Television\nNews show Fox & Friends, where they discussed the flyer, the universityโs disciplinary process, and\nthe political tensions surrounding TPUSAโs presence on campus.  (Id. ยถ 51).  Plaintiffs claim that,\nafter the interview, they were placed on TPUSAโs Professor Watchlist.  (Id. ยถ 59).  They also claim\nthat they received a number of โhate mailโ messages in both their emails and voicemail, and some\nsuch messages were sent directly to the University via its โContact Usโ form.  (Id. ยถยถ 59,60).\n5\nCase 2:21-cv-00039   Document 90   Filed 12/01/22   Page 5 of 27 PageID #: 8917\n\nPublic opinion about Plaintiffsโ actions and Dr. Donadioโs reaction was not unanimous,\nhowever.  For example, Alex Sloan, an alumnus, voiced the opinion that Dr. Donadio went on a\nโpublic smear campaign,โ and that the  โinflammatory violent propaganda targeting professors [was]\nwildly inappropriate and should be concerning to all academics[.]โ (Id. ยถ 62). \nAfter Holt completed his investigation, he determined that โ[t]he preponderance of the\nevidence supports the conclusion [Plaintiffs] violated Tennessee Tech Policy 600, Code of Conduct.โ \n(Doc. No. 62-14 at 5).    That policy, in pertinent part, reads:\n1. In carrying out Tennessee Techโs educational, research, and public service\nmissions, Tennessee Tech relies on the ethical and responsible conduct of all\nemployees. Employees are expected to conduct themselves fairly, honestly, in good\nfaith, and in accordance with the highest ethical and professional standards and to\ncomply with applicable laws, regulations, contractual obligations, and Tennessee\nTech policies.\n2. Employees are expected to be committed to creating an environment that promotes\nacademic freedom, diversity, fair treatment, and respect for all faculty, staff, students\nand the general public.\n* * *\n4.  Employees are expected to maintain the highest levels of integrity and objectivity\nas they perform their duties.  As such, employees are expected to take all reasonable\nprecautions and seek appropriate guidance to ensure their outside interests do not\nplace them in conflict with carrying out their duties and responsibilities to Tennessee\nTech[.]\n(Doc. No. 62-23 at 2-3).\nIn an email dated April 16, 2021 to Provost Bruce, Holt attached his report and stated that\nClaire  Stinson,  Vice  President  of  Planning  and  Finance,  โconcurred  in  [his]  findings  and\nrecommendations[.]โ (Id. at 1).  Holt also noted, however, that Plaintiffs had five days to request\nreconsideration, otherwise โthe Vice Presidentโs decision becomes final.โ  (Id.).  Through counsel,\n6\nCase 2:21-cv-00039   Document 90   Filed 12/01/22   Page 6 of 27 PageID #: 8918\n\nboth  Plaintiffsโ  moved  for  reconsideration,  but  the  requests  were  denied.    (DSOF  ยถ  26). \nAccordingly, Vice President Stinson forwarded the matter to Provost Bruce for discipline.\nIn determining appropriate discipline, Provost Bruce interviewed Plaintiffs, Dr. Donadio, and\nMs. Sciolis.  She also reviewed TTUโs policies and consulted with university legal counsel.  (Id. ยถยถ\n28, 30).  Dr. Bruce came to the conclusion that the purpose of the flyer โwas to target one individual,\na coworker, and a small group of students to threaten and harass and intimidate them, [and] to incite\nothers to participate in the harassment[.]โ (DSOF ยถ 30).  Provost Bruce also believed that, in the\nuniversity setting, โevery employee is entitled to their own opinions and thoughtsโ but โif those\nviewpoints start to then impinge on the rights of other [students], they start mistreating others\nbecause of those viewpoints, they start taking actions that are based on those viewpoints that are\ninappropriate actions, then it becomes a concernโ for the university. (Id. ยถ 33).  Indeed, Dr. Donadio\nin his deposition testified that he viewed the flyer as a threat, and Ms. Sciolis told Provost Bruce that,\nbecause of the flyer and the anxiety it caused, she missed class.  (DSOF ยถยถ 34, 35; Doc. No. 56-9,\nBruce Dep. at 60; Doc. No. 56-14, Donadio Dep. at 123-125).\nIn imposing discipline, Provost Bruce considered the possibility of revoking tenure in\naccordance with TTUโs Policy 207.  She decided against that route after consulting with the Faculty\nSenate President and Faculty Trustee.  (DSOF ยถ 38).  Instead, she imposed discipline upon both\nPlaintiffs for violating Policy 600 as referenced previously, and Policy 007 pertaining to โFree\nSpeech on Campusโ that provides:\nTennessee Tech is committed to maintaining a campus as a marketplace of ideas for\nall Students and Faculty in which the free exchange of ideas is not to be suppressed\nbecause the ideas put forth are thought by some or even most members of Tennessee\nTechโs  community  to  be  offensive,  unwise,  immoral,  indecent,  disagreeable,\nconservative, liberal, traditional, radical, or wrong-headed.\n7\nCase 2:21-cv-00039   Document 90   Filed 12/01/22   Page 7 of 27 PageID #: 8919\n\n(Doc. No. 81-17 at 3).  \nPlaintiffs were informed of Provost Bruceโs decision by letter dated May 13, 2021.  In it, they\nwere told that discipline was imposed as a result of โyour actions, not your beliefs or ideasโ; and\nโyour attempts to harass, intimidate, and/or threaten another employee and a small group of students\non campus students [sic] whose views and opinions were contrary to your own.โ  (Id.).  The\ndiscipline included Plaintiffs being (1) not permitted to serve as a faculty advisor to any student\norganizations; (2) not allowed to participate in study abroad activities; (3) ineligible for non-\ninstructional faculty assignments; and (4) ineligible for salary increases for a year.  Additionally, both\nwere required to meet with the Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences (or his or her designee) at\nthe start of each semester โto reinforce with you the importance of not bringing personal grievances\ninto the workplace.โ  (Id. at 2-3).  Plaintiffs were also required to complete sensitivity training.  (Id.). \nII. Legal Discussion\nMr. Smithโs flyer called Dr. Donadio a racist.  Words have meaning and college language\nteachers should understand that better than most.  Perhaps, however, Dr. Gruber and Mr. Smith are\nclever by half because, at least according to some:\nAccusations of โracismโ no longer are โobviously and naturally harmfulโ. The word\nhas been watered down by overuse, becoming common coin in political discourse.\n. . . Formerly a โracistโ was a believer in the superiority of one's own race, often a\nsupporter of slavery or segregation, or a fomenter of hatred among the races. . . .\nPoliticians sometimes use the term much more loosely, as referring to anyone (not\nof the speaker's race) who opposes the speaker's political goalsโon the โrationaleโ\nthat the speaker espouses only what is good for the jurisdiction (or the audience), and\nsince oneโs opponents have no cause to oppose what is beneficial, their opposition\nmust be based on race. The term used this way means only: โHe is neither for me nor\nof our race; and I invite you to vote your race.โ . . . That may be an unfortunate brand\nof politics, but it also drains the term of its former, decidedly opprobrious, meaning.\n. . .\n8\nCase 2:21-cv-00039   Document 90   Filed 12/01/22   Page 8 of 27 PageID #: 8920\n\nLanguage is subject to leveling forces. When a word acquires a strong meaning it\nbecomes useful in rhetoric. A single word conveys a powerful image. When\nplantation owners held blacks in chattel slavery, when 100 years later governors\ndeclared โsegregation now, segregation foreverโ, everyone knew what a โracistโ was.\nThe strength of the image invites use. To obtain emotional impact, orators employed\nthe term without the strong justification, shading its meaning just a little. So long as\nany part of the old meaning lingers, there is a tendency to invoke the word for its\nimpact rather than to convey a precise meaning. We may regret that the language is\nlosing the meaning of a word, especially when there is no ready substitute.  \nStevens v. Tillman, 855 F.2d 394, 402 (7th Cir. 1988).\nThe observations in Stevens are almost thirty-five years old. Matters have only gotten worse\nsince then, undoubtedly to the dismay of English language purists.  In many walks of life, including\nacademia it seems, civility and professionalism have taken a backseat to unnecessary discord and\ndivisiveness, with terms like โracistโ being bandied about with reckless abandon.  โBut we serve in\na court of law rather than of language and cannot insist that speakers cling to older meanings.โ  Id. \nNor can a court legislate sensible behavior.  \nWhat the Court can and must do is determine whether a genuine issue of material fact exists\non Plaintiffsโ First Amendment retaliation or Fourteenth Amendment due process claims and\nwhether either side is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. If there remains a jury question on a\nclaim, the question then becomes whether Defendant is entitled to qualified immunity.4\n4  The Court analyzes these issues sequentially because, to overcome the qualified immunity defense,\nplaintiffs must establish that (1) โbased upon the applicable law, the facts viewed in the light most favorable\nto the plaintiffs show that a constitutional violation has occurred,โ and (2) โthe violation involved a clearly\nestablished constitutional right of which a reasonable person would have known.โ  Sample v. Bailey, 409\nF.3d 689, 695-96 (6th Cir.2005); see also Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.S. 194, 201 (2001). Although โthe court\nmay address these prongs in any order . . . if the plaintiff cannot make both showings, the offic[ial] is entitled\nto qualified immunity.โ  Brown v. Lewis, 779 F.3d 401, 412 (6th Cir. 2015) (citing Pearson v. Callahan, 555\nU.S. 223, 236 (2009)).  Hence, if โno constitutional violation occurred, the Court need not address [the\npartiesโ] arguments regarding qualified immunity.โ  Fox v. Corrigan, 161 F. App'x 522, 526 (6th Cir. 2005);\nsee also Criss v. City of Kent, 867 F.2d 259, 261 (6th Cir. 1988) (observing that if โno constitutional\nviolation occurred . . . the court would never reach the qualified immunity questionโ).\n9\nCase 2:21-cv-00039   Document 90   Filed 12/01/22   Page 9 of 27 PageID #: 8921\n\nA.  First Amendment Retaliation\nโ[T]he Free Speech Clause applies at public universitiesโ and โ[t]hus, the state may not act\nas though professors or students โshed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression\nat the [university] gate.โโ Meriwether v. Hartop, 992 F.3d 492, 503 (6th Cir. 2021) (quoting Tinker\nv. Des Moines Indep. Cmty. Sch. Dist., 393 U.S. 503, 506 (1969)).  Nevertheless, โfree-speech rules\napply differently when the government is doing the speaking [and] that remains true even when a\ngovernment employee is doing the talking.โ  Id. at 503-04.\nThe basic free-speech rules for public employees were laid out by the Supreme Court in \nPickering v. Bd. of Educ., 391 U.S. 563, 568 (1968), Mt. Healthy City Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ. v.\nDoyle, 429 U.S. 274, 287 (1977), and Connick v. Myers, 461 U.S. 138, 147โ50 (1983).  In Pickering,\nthe Court established a two-part test, requiring the employee to show first that his or her speech\naddressed โmatters of public concern,โ and second that his or her interest โin commenting upon\nmatters of public concernโ outweighed โthe interest of the State, as an employer, in promoting the\nefficiency of the public services it performs through its employees.โ Pickering, 391 U.S. at 568.\n Mt. Healthy added a causation element to Pickering pursuant to which the employee must\nshow that his or her constitutionally-protected conduct was a โsubstantialโ or โmotivatingโ factor\nin the  imposition of discipline.  Mt. Healthy, 429 U.S. at 287.  If that showing is made, the employer\ncan still escape liability if it shows โby a preponderance of the evidence that [it] would have reached\nthe same decision ... even in the absence of the [plaintiff's] protected conduct.โ Id.  \nFinally, in Connick, the Court refined the Pickering test by holding that โ[w]hen employee\nexpression cannot be fairly considered as relating to any matter of political, social, or other concern\nto the community, government officials should enjoy wide latitude in managing their offices, without\n10\nCase 2:21-cv-00039   Document 90   Filed 12/01/22   Page 10 of 27 PageID #: 8922\n\nintrusive oversight by the judiciary in the name of the First Amendment.โ  Connick, 461 U.S. at 146. \nEffectively, โConnick erected a dichotomy between citizens speaking on matters of public concern\nand employees speaking on matters only of personal interest[.]โ  Scarbrough v. Morgan Cty. Bd. of\nEduc., 470 F.3d 250, 256 (6th Cir. 2006).\nTaken  together,  these  three  case means that,  in  order to  establish  a  claim  for  First\nAmendment retaliation, Plaintiffs, as public employees, must show that (1) they engaged in\nconstitutionally protected speech or conduct; (2) an adverse action was taken against them that would\ndeter a person of ordinary firmness from continuing to engage in that conduct; and (3) there is a\ncausal connection between elements one and two โ that is, the adverse action was motivated at least\nin part by his protected conduct.  Myers v. City of Centerville, 41 F.4th 746, 759 (6th Cir. 2022);\nBennett v. Metro. Gov't of Nashville & Davidson Cnty., 977 F.3d 530, 537 (6th Cir. 2020). Dr.\nBruce insists that Plaintiffs have not established any of the elements of a prima facie case.   In doing\nso, she advances several arguments, a couple of which border on the fanciful.\n1.  Speech of a Public Employee Versus Speech as a Private Citizen \nDr. Bruce first argues that Plaintiffs spoke as employees of TTU when distributing the flyers. \nIf so, this would exonerate the university from liability because โwhen public employees make\nstatements pursuant to their official duties, the employees are not speaking as citizens for First\nAmendment purposes.โ  Garcetti v. Ceballos, 547 U.S. 410, 442 (2006).  Because the government\nโhas a broad right to controlโ its own speech,  the โemployer[] may discipline the employee[] for\nsaying something unacceptable because this speech is effectively the government[.]โ  DeCrane v.\nEckart, 12 F.4th 586, 595 (6th Cir. 2021) (citing Pleasant Grove City v. Summum, 555 U.S. 460, 467\n(2009)). \n11\nCase 2:21-cv-00039   Document 90   Filed 12/01/22   Page 11 of 27 PageID #: 8923\n\nSometimes, however, โit can be unclear whether an employee spoke while wearing a โpublicโ\nor โprivateโ hat.โ  Id. at 595.   In โdecid[ing] whether expression falls within the public or private\nbucket,โ a court may be called upon to answer a number of questions, such as โWhat was the\nโimpetusโ for or โmotivation[ ]โ behind the speech?โ; โWhat was the speechโs setting?โ; and โWho\nwas the speechโs audience?โ Id. at 595-96 (citations omitted).  \nThe Court finds it unnecessary to answer such inquiries here because, to support the\nargument that Plaintiffs were speaking as employees, Dr. Bruce relies upon deductive reasoning\ninvolving leaps the Court is unwilling to take.  Specifically, she asserts that a teacherโs job is to\nteach; the goal of the flyer was to educate; the flyer was placed in a university building during\nbusiness hours; ergo, Plaintiffโs action โis identical to that of a professor engaging in his or her\nprofessional teaching responsibilities.โ  (Doc. No. 70 at 10).  Not so.\nโThe critical question under Garcetti is whether the speech at issue is itself ordinarily within\nthe scope of an employeeโs duties, not whether it merely concerns those duties.โ Lane v. Franks, 573\nU.S. 228, 240 (2014).  Further, after the Supreme Courtโs decision in Lane, โthe Garcetti exception\nto First Amendment protection for speech residing in the phrase โowes its existence to a public\nemployeeโs professional responsibilitiesโ must be read narrowly as speech that an employee made\nin furtherance of the ordinary responsibilities of his [or her] employment.โ  Boulton v. Swanson, 795\nF.3d 526, 534 (6th Cir. 2015).  Making and surreptitiously dropping-off anonymous flyers to\nunknown recipients was neither an official duty nor a professional responsibility of either Plaintiff. \n2.  Adverse Action\nDr. Bruce also argues that Plaintiffs have not established the second element of a retaliation\nclaim because the โnominal sanctionsโ imposed โwould not chill the speech of an ordinary person.โ \n12\nCase 2:21-cv-00039   Document 90   Filed 12/01/22   Page 12 of 27 PageID #: 8924\n\n(Doc. No. 70 at 19).  As she correctly points out, โ[t]he term โadverse actionโ has traditionally\nreferred to actions such as โdischarge, demotions, refusal to [h]ire, nonrenewal of contracts, and\nfailure to promote.โโ  Handy-Clay v. City of Memphis, 695 F.3d 531, 545 (6th Cir. 2012) (citations\nomitted).  However, the Sixth Circuit has also recognized that a court is โrequired to tailor[] [its]\nanalysis under the adverse action prong to the circumstances of the specific retaliation claimโ at\nissue. Dye v. Off. of the Racing Comm'n, 702 F.3d 286, 303 (6th Cir. 2012) (citation omitted).\nโThe term โadverse actionโ arose in the employment contextโ and generally envisions a\nmaterial change in employment status or benefits like those just mentioned.  Fritz v. Charter Twp.\nof Comstock, 592 F.3d 718, 724 (6th Cir.2010).  Under the First Amendment, in contrast, an adverse\naction is one that would โlikely chill a person of ordinary firmness from continuing to engage in that\nactivity,โโ  Ryan v. Blackwell, 979 F.3d 519, 525 (6th Cir. 2020) (quoting Thaddeus-X v. Blatter,\n175 F.3d 378, 398 (6th Cir. 1999)). This may include such things as โโharassment or publicizing\nfacts damaging to a personโs reputation.โ  Id. (quoting, Fritz, 592 F.3d at 724).  \nNotably, the harassment necessary to rise to a level sufficient to deter an individual is โnot\nextreme.โโ Perkins v. Twp. of Clayton, 411 F.Appโx 810, 814 (6th Cir. 2011) (citing SiggersโEl v.\nBarlow, 412 F.3d 693, 701 (6th Cir.2005)); see also Bloch v. Ribar, 156 F.3d 673, 679 (6th Cir.\n1998) (citation omitted) (โThe effect on freedom of speech may be small, but since there is no\njustification for harassing people for exercising their constitutional rights it need not be great in order\nto be actionable.โ).  For purposes of a First Amendment retaliation claim, therefore, unless the\nadverse action is โde minimusโ or โinconsequential,โ the issue of โwhether an alleged adverse action\nis sufficient to deter a person of ordinary firmness is generally a question of fact.โ  Wurzelbacher v.\nJones-Kelley, 675 F.3d 580, 583โ84 (6th Cir. 2012).  \n13\nCase 2:21-cv-00039   Document 90   Filed 12/01/22   Page 13 of 27 PageID #: 8925\n\nThis Court cannot conclude, as a matter of law or fact, that being prohibited from (1) serving\nas a faculty advisor; (2) participating in studies abroad; and (3) receiving no non-instructional faculty\nassignments or a salary increase for a year, while at the same time being required to (4) meet with\nthe Dean yearly; and (5) undergo sensitivity training would not deter others from engaging in\nprotected conduct.  Summary judgment is not appropriate based upon a supposed lack of an adverse\naction.\n3.  Causal Connection\nDr. Bruce further argues that the content of the flyer had nothing to do with the punishment\nimposed and, hence, she has rebutted the causal connection necessary to establish the third element. \nAfter all, she wrote in her letter to each Plaintiff that โThe disciplinary action in this matter are a\nresult of your actions, not your beliefs or ideas,โ and she reiterated as much in her deposition.  (Doc.\nNo. 70-7 at 44, 92 & Eh. 7, 8).   โThe employerโs rebuttal involves โissues of fact,โ however, and\nmay not be decided on a motion for summary judgment unless the evidence โis so one-sided that one\nparty must prevail as a matter of law.โโ Cherry v. Pickell, 188 F. Appโx 465, 69 (6th Cir. 2006)\n(quoting Leary v. Daeschner, 349 F.3d 888, 898 (6th Cir.2003)).  Dr. Bruceโs self-serving statements\nto the side, query whether, as Plaintiffs suggest, the same sanctions would have been imposed had\nthe flyer told the reader about โa Hot Dog Eating Contest,โ or expressed the opinion that โPralines\n& Cream Ice Cream is better than Vanilla.โ  (Doc. No. 84 at 4).  At a minimum, this presents a\nfactual question making summary judgment inappropriate.\n4.  Constitutionally Protected Speech and Balancing Interests\nLeft for consideration is the first element of a retaliation claim, to wit, whether Plaintiffs\nengaged in constitutionally protected speech or conduct.  This inquiry contains two โsub-elementsโ:\n14\nCase 2:21-cv-00039   Document 90   Filed 12/01/22   Page 14 of 27 PageID #: 8926\n\n(1) whether  the statement in question constitutes speech on a matter of public concern; and (if so)\n(2) whether the plaintiffs interest in making such speech outweigh the employerโs interest โin\npromoting the  efficiency of the public services it performs through its employees.โ Ryan, 979 F.3d\nat 526 (citing Leary, 228 F.3d at 737).  Again, Dr. Bruce insists Plaintiffs have met neither element.\nWith respect to the first sub-element, Dr. Bruce argues that the speech at issue was not a\nmatter of public concern because the flyer was the result of a personal grievance Plaintiffs had with\nDr. Donadio.  Alternatively, she argues they had a โbeefโ with the school and that is why they spoke. \nThe Court is unpersuaded by either argument.\nSince at least Connick, the Supreme Court has instructed courts not to โconstitutionalizeโ\nemployee grievances,  461 U.S. at 154, 103 S.Ct. 1684, so as to avoid โcompromis[ing] the proper\nfunctioning of government offices.โ City of San Diego v. Roe, 543 U.S. 77, 82, 125 S.Ct. 521, 160\nL.Ed.2d  410  (2004).    โ[T]he  quintessential  employee  beef  [is  that]  management  has  acted\nincompetently.โ   Handy-Clay, 695 F.3d 531, 540โ41 (6th Cir. 2012).  Similarly, interpersonal\nsquabbles โ not being matters of public concern โ are not constitutionally protected.  See Naghtin\nv. Montague Fire Dist. Bd., 674 F. App'x 475, 479 (6th Cir. 2016);  Mosholder v. Barnhardt, 679\nF.3d 443, 449โ50 (6th Cir. 2012).  \nAs a personal matter, Plaintiffs were not pleased that Dr. Donadio applauded the school\nboardโs decision not to consider changing the name of the mascot at Algood Middle School.  And,\nas faculty members, they were not happy that TTU allowed TPUSA onto campus.  These undisputed\nfacts do not mean, perforce, that theirs was simply a personal or employment grievance and not a\nmatter of public concern. \nโWhether an employeeโs speech addresses a matter of public concern must be determined\n15\nCase 2:21-cv-00039   Document 90   Filed 12/01/22   Page 15 of 27 PageID #: 8927\n\nby the content, form, and context of a given statement, as revealed by the whole record.โ Connick,\n461 U.S. at 147-148. Speech which can be โfairly considered as relating to any matter of political,\nsocial, or other concern to the communityโ touches upon matters of public concern.  Id.  โWhile\nmotive for the speech is a relevant factor, . . . the pertinent question is not why the employee spoke,\nbut what he said,โ meaning that a court must โexamine the point of the speech in question[.]โ  Myers,\n41 F.4th at 760.\nThe point of the flyer was to call out Dr. Donadio as a racist and to identify TPUSA (rightly\nor wrongly) as a racist organization.  Certainly, identifying and addressing racism on college\ncampuses is a matter of public concern.  See Connick, 461 U.S. at 148 at n.8 (noting that the โright\nto protest racial discriminationโ is โinherently of public concernโ); Hardy v. Jefferson Cmty. Coll.,\n260 F.3d 671, 679 (6th Cir. 2001) (observing that โrace, gender, and power conflicts in our societyโ\nare โmatters of overwhelming public concernโ); McLin v. Bd. of Police Commโrs, 10 F. Appโx 388,\n389 (8th Cir. 2001) (โAssuming it is not related entirely to a private dispute between the plaintiff and\ndefendant, racism in a public agency is inherently a matter of public concern.โ).\nWhether Plaintiffsโ allegations about Dr. Donadio and TPUSA are true or not the Court does\nnot know and, at this point in the analysis, is irrelevant.  See v. City of Elyria, 502 F.3d 484, 493 (6th\nCir. 2007).  What is relevant is that the speech โtouched uponโ a matter of public concern, even if\nthe motive for the speech was mixed.  \nโโIf any part of an employeeโs speech, which contributes to the [disciplinary action], relates\nto a matter of public concern, the court must conduct a balancing of interests test as set forth in\nPickering[.]โโ  See Bonell v. Lorenzo, 241 F.3d 800, 812 (6th Cir. 2001) (quoting Rahn v. Drake\nCtr., Inc., 31 F.3d 407, 412 (6th Cir.1994)).  Plaintiffsโ disagreement with Dr. Donadio and the group\n16\nCase 2:21-cv-00039   Document 90   Filed 12/01/22   Page 16 of 27 PageID #: 8928\n\nhe led was not merely personal, nor was it a quotidian workplace grievance.  Accordingly, it is to the\nthat balancing test that the Court now turns.\nBalancing interests must begin with the fundamental notion that there is aโrobust tradition\nof academic freedom in our nation's post-secondary schools.โ Hardy, 260 F.3d at 679. Indeed, the\nSupreme Court has โlong recognized that, given the important purpose of public education and the\nexpansive freedoms of speech and thought associated with the university environment, universities\noccupy a special niche in our constitutional tradition.โ Grutter v. Bollinger 539 U.S. 306, 329 (2003). \nBecause โa professor's rights to academic freedom and freedom of expression are paramount in the\nacademic  setting,โ  Bonnell,  241  F.3d  at  823,  โprofessors  at  public  universities  retain  First\nAmendment protections at least when engaged in core academic functions, such as teaching and\nscholarship.โ Meriwether, 992 F.3d at 505.\nThe paeans to academic freedom and free speech do not give faculty members a license to\nviolate university rules without consequences, however.  โIt goes without saying that a university has\nan interest in fostering a collegial educational environment while doing everything within its power\nto maintain its reputation in the academic community both on campus and around the nation.โ  Trejo\nv. Shoben, 319 F.3d 878, 888 (7th Cir. 2003); See also Bonnell, 241 F.3d at 822 (โA collegeโs or\nuniversityโs interest in maintaining a hostile-free learning environment . . . is well recognized.โ). \nHence, the First Amendment does not require public employers to tolerate every type of personal\nattack against others, even when the attack touches upon a matter of public concern.   Instead, โ[i]f\nthe manner and content of an employeeโs speech is demeaning, disrespectful, rude, and insulting, and\nis perceived that way in the workplace, the government employer is within its discretion to take\ndisciplinary action.โ  Shi v. Montgomery, 679 F. Appโx 828, 835 (11th Cir. 2017).  See also Munroe\n17\nCase 2:21-cv-00039   Document 90   Filed 12/01/22   Page 17 of 27 PageID #: 8929\n\nv. Cent. Bucks Sch. Dist., 805 F.3d 454, 472 (3d Cir. 2015), (citation omitted) (observing that โthe\ngovernmentโs legitimate and countervailing interest, as an employer, in promoting workplace\nefficiency and avoiding workplace disruptionโ may tip the Pickering scale); Isibor v. Bd. of Regents\nof State Univ. & Cmty. Coll. Sys. of Tenn., 891 F.2d 290 (6th Cir. 1989) (stating that โ[c]omments\nwhich adversely affect close working relationships or disrupt the maintenance of discipline or cause\ndisharmony among coworkers may tip the balance in a defendantโs favorโ) .\nEven if the term has been watered down over the years, calling a colleague a racist is hardly\ncollegial, and threatening to place him and the group he advises on a โlistโ is no better.  Moreover,\nlike other institutions of higher learning, TTU has rules that need to be followed in order for the\ninstitution to fulfill its educational mandate and mission.  It certainly is not too much for a university\nto ask that its faculty members act professionally, engage in ethical conduct, be respectful, and\nmaintain the highest level of integrity as required by Policy 600.  Sneaking around and dropping-off\nanonymous flyers attacking a fellow professor falls short of such conduct, or so the university could\nreasonably  conclude.    Likewise,  namelessly  identifying  a  group  as  promoting  hate  without\nsubstantiating the allegation cuts against the promotion of the โfree exchange of ideasโ contemplated\nby Policy 007.\nIt is true, as Plaintiffs point out, that TTU has shown little in the way of actual harm.  To the\ncontrary, Dr. Donadio and Ms. Sciolis were so unfazed that they went on Fox television.  That\nPlaintiffs unwittingly provided those two fodder for potentially spreading their ideas to a broader\naudience says nothing about the propriety of the universityโs reaction.  Besides, โ[s]chool officials\nhave an affirmative duty to not only ameliorate the harmful effects of disruptions, but to prevent\nthem from happening in the first place,โ even though โโforecasting disruption is unmistakably\n18\nCase 2:21-cv-00039   Document 90   Filed 12/01/22   Page 18 of 27 PageID #: 8930\n\ndifficult to do.โโ  Lowery v. Euverard, 497 F.3d 584, 596 (6th Cir. 2007).5  It was reasonable for\nTTU to believe that, absent disciplinary action, Plaintiffsโ speech would (1) disrupt its ability to\nfulfill its core mission of teaching students, given a universityโs โstrong interest in preventing . . .\nspeech that rises to the level of harassment,โ Bonnell, 241 F.3d at 824; (2) undercut its ability to\nenforce internal policies relating to employee conduct and free speech; and (3) diminish its\nobligation to protect all studentsโ freedom of speech and a free marketplace of ideas.\nUltimately, โ[t]he problem in any case,โ just as it is here, โis to arrive at a balance between\nthe interests of the teacher, as a citizen, in commenting upon matters of public concern and the\ninterest of the State, as an employer, in promoting the efficiency of the public services it performs\nthrough its employees.โ Pickering, 391 U.S. at 568. โAlthough such particularized balancing is\ndifficult, [we] must reach the most appropriate possible balance of the competing interests.โ\nConnick, 461 U.S. at 150, 103 S.Ct. 1684. That balance tips in favor of Dr. Bruce and TTU and\nsummary judgment will be granted in her favor on Plaintiffsโ First Amendment retaliation claim.\nB.  Qualified Immunity and First Amendment Retaliation\nโQualified immunity shields government officials in the performance of discretionary\nfunctions from standing trial for civil liability unless their actions violate clearly established rights.โ \nDiLuzio v. Vill. of Yorkville, 796 F.3d 604, 608 (6th Cir. 2015). โ[C]learly established law should\nnot be defined at a โhigh level of generalityโ โ  it โmust be particularized to the facts of the case.โโ \n5  The Court recognizes that Lowery involved the actions of a high school football coach in relation\nto his team.   However, the notion that an employer can act when it reasonably believes an employeeโs speech\nis likely to interfere with the employerโs mission applies to the governmental employer/employee relationship\ngenerally.  See Millspaugh v. Cobb Cnty Fire & Emg, Servs., 2022 WL 17101337 at *7 (11th Cir.\nNov. 22, 2022); Davis v. Billington, 51 F. Supp. 3d 97, 115 (D.D.C. 2014); Pappas v. Giuliani, 290\nF.3d 143, 151 (2d Cir. 2002).\n19\nCase 2:21-cv-00039   Document 90   Filed 12/01/22   Page 19 of 27 PageID #: 8931\n\nWhite v. Pauly, 137 S. Ct. 548, 552 (2017) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted). This\ndoes not require a plaintiff to identify an earlier decision that is โdirectly on point, but existing\nprecedent must have placed the statutory or constitutional question beyond debate.โ  Mullenix v.\nLuna, 577 U.S. 7, 12 (2015) (quoting alโKidd, 563 U.S. at 741).   โ[T]his narrow definition of\nโclearly establishedโ functions to protect โall but the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly\nviolate the law.โโ  Mitchell v. Schlabach, 864 F.3d 416, 424 (6th Cir. 2017) (quoting Mullenix, 136\nS. Ct. at 308).  It also serves to protect โreasonableโ but โmistakenโ decisions by officials acting in\ngood faith.  Hunter v. Bryant, 502 U.S. 224, 229 (1991).\nOnce the defense is raised, it is the plaintiffโs burden to show โthat the right was โclearly\nestablishedโ at the time of the challenged conduct.โ  al-Kidd, 563 U.S. at 735 (citing Harlow v.\nFitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818 (1982)).  Plaintiffs have not met that burden here, although they\nattempt to do so in two ways.\nFirst, Plaintiffs argue that qualified immunity is inappropriate based upon Connick because \nthey โmade their speech as private citizens (rather than professors at a university), and spoke about\na matter of public concern (racism).โ (Doc. No. 81 at 15-16).  In Connick, while โthe Supreme Court\nclearly established that racial discrimination is inherently a matter of public concern,โ  Perry v.\nMcGinnis, 209 F.3d 597, 608 (6th Cir. 2000), it did not establish that all speech by public employees\ntouching upon matters of public concern is always acceptable.  To the contrary, โ[b]ecause of the\nenormous variety of fact situations,โ the Supreme Court found it โ[n]either appropriate [n]or feasible\nto lay down a general standard against which all statements may be judged.โ  Connick, 461 U.S. at\n154.  Indeed, a number of circuits have found that constitutional rights requiring a particularized\nbalancing test will rarely be โclearly establishedโ for qualified immunity purposes.  See e.g., Nord\n20\nCase 2:21-cv-00039   Document 90   Filed 12/01/22   Page 20 of 27 PageID #: 8932\n\nv. Walsh Cty., 757 F.3d 734, 740 (8th Cir. 2014) (โ[I]f the evidence in the record is sufficient to\nproceed with the Pickering/Connick balancing exercise, this circuit has held that โthe asserted First\nAmendment right will rarely be considered clearly established.โโ); Maggio v. Sipple, 211 F.3d 1346,\n1354 (11th Cir. 2000) (citation omitted) (โBecause the analysis of First Amendment retaliation\nclaims  under  the  PickeringโConnick  test  involve[s]  legal  determinations  that  are  intensely\nfact-specific and do not lend themselves to clear, bright-line rules . . . a defendant in a First\nAmendment suit will only rarely be on notice that his actions are unlawful.โ); DiMeglio v. Haines,\n45 F.3d 790, 806 (4th Cir.1995) (โ[O]nly infrequently will it be โclearly establishedโ that a public\nemployee's speech on a matter of public concern is constitutionally protected, because the relevant\ninquiry  requires  a  โparticularized  balancingโ  that  is  subtle,  difficult  to  apply,  and  not  yet\nwell-defined.โ)\nSecond, Plaintiffs argue:\nDefendant also cannot establish the second element of her qualified immunity\ndefense, because Plaintiffsโ rights were clearly established at the time she issued the\nsanctions. Notably, Plaintiffsโ first request for reconsideration was sent into Tech\nbefore Defendant determined and implemented the sanctions. In that letter, Plaintiffsโ\ncounsel  explained  in  detail  why  the  speech  was  protected  under  the  First\nAmendment.  This letter was sent on April 16th, 2021, one month before Defendant\nissued the sanctions. \n(Doc. No. 81 at 16) (emphasis in original).  However, the question is whether existing legal authority\nhas placed the statutory or constitutional question beyond debate, and this is determined by looking\nfirst to Supreme Court precedent, then to Sixth Circuit precedent, and then to decisions of other\ncourts of appeal.  Barber v. Miller, 809 F.3d 840, 845 (6th Cir. 2015); Flint v. Kentucky Depโt of\nCorr., 270 F.3d 340, 347 (6th Cir. 2001).  Respectfully, a 4-page opinion letter from attorney Robert\nC. Bigelow hardly makes the law clearly established.\n21\nCase 2:21-cv-00039   Document 90   Filed 12/01/22   Page 21 of 27 PageID #: 8933\n\nTo overcome the qualified immunity defense, it was incumbent upon Plaintiffs to show that\nany reasonable person in Dr. Bruceโs position would know that discipline could not be meted out\nunder the circumstances she encountered.  โThatโs a tough standard.  How tough?  Well, [Plaintiffsโ]\nmust show that โthen-existing precedentโ put the illegality of [Dr. Bruceโs] conduct โbeyond debate.โโ \nAshford v. Raby, 951 F.3d 798, 801 (6th Cir. 2020).  Because Plaintiffs have not done so, Dr. Bruce\nis entitled to qualified immunity in her individual capacity on Plaintiffsโ First Amendment retaliation\nclaim.\nC.  Due Process and the Fourteenth Amendment\nโThe Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits states from depriving โany\nperson of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.โ U.S. Const. amend. XIV, ยง 1. To\nstate a procedural due process claim, a plaintiff must establish that: (1) he has a property interest\nprotected by the Due Process Clause; (2) he was deprived of this property interest; and (3) the state\ndid not afford him adequate pre-deprivation procedural rights.โ  Cahoo v. SAS Analytics Inc., 912\nF.3d 887, 900 (6th Cir. 2019); accord Albrecht v. Treon, 617 F.3d 890, 894 (6th Cir. 2010).\nAs a preliminary matter, the parties dispute whether Plaintiffs were deprived of a property\ninterest, which โare not created by the Constitution,โ but, instead, โare created and their dimensions\nare defined by existing rules or understandings that stem from an independent source such as state\nlaw[.]โ  Cleveland Bd. of Educ. v. Loudermill, 470 U.S. 532, 538 (1985) (quoting Bd. of Regents\nv. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 576 (1972)).  Plaintiffs claim they were denied property interests when Dr.\nGruberโs grant was revoked, they were prohibited from study abroad trips, and they were subjected\nto random visits to their classroom by the Dean of the College of Arts and Science.  According to\nthem, these actions limited their professional growth, stunted their careers, and damaged their\n22\nCase 2:21-cv-00039   Document 90   Filed 12/01/22   Page 22 of 27 PageID #: 8934\n\nreputation.  \nPlaintiffs rely on Smock v. Bd. of Regents of Univ. of Mich., 353 F. Supp.3d 651, 657 (E.D.\nMich. 2018) for the proposition that โprofessors may have a protected property interest in their jobs\nduties if those responsibilities are essential to the employeeโs scholarship and academic standing.โ \n(Doc. No. 81 at 10).  Reliance on Smock is misplaced.  Not only was Smock decided in the context\nof a motion to dismiss, underpinning its property interests discussion was the Supreme Courtโs\nobservation that โ[t]o have a property interest in a benefit a person must clearly have more than an\nabstract need or desire and more than a unilateral expectation of it.  He must have a legitimate claim\nof entitlement to it.โ  Colorado v. Gonzales, 545 U.S. 748, 756, 125 S.Ct. 2796, 162 L.Ed.2d 658\n(2005).  The plaintiff in Smock arguably had a property interest in sabbatical leave because there\napparently was no discretion for the school to deny it, and arguably a property interest in his role as\na graduate student advisor under his contract with the school, although that was less clear.  353 F.\nSupp. 3d at 656.  The same cannot be said here.\nUndoubtedly, โgovernment employees have a cognizable property interest in their job if they\nhave tenure.โ Hasanaj v. Detroit Pub. Sch. Cmty. Dist., 35 F.4th 437, 448 (6th Cir. 2022).  Beyond\nthat, and โ[a]s a general rule, Sixth Circuit caselaw establishes that โtenured university professors\ndo not have a constitutionally protected property interest in administrative posts.โโ  Kaplan v. Univ.\nof Louisville, 10 F.4th 569, 579 (6th Cir. 2021) (citation omitted).  The Sixth Circuit recognizes\nโtwo potential exceptions to [its] general rule[:] [f]irst, a professor may have a property interest in\nan administrative position that is itself a tenure-track appointment; [or second], an express guarantee\nthat the employee holds the administrative post subject to removal for cause might create a property\ninterest.โ  Id.  Both exceptions are in keeping with the Supreme Courtโs teaching that there must be\n23\nCase 2:21-cv-00039   Document 90   Filed 12/01/22   Page 23 of 27 PageID #: 8935\n\na legitimate claim of entitlement to the interest, and not just a desire, want, or need.\nPlaintiffs have not shown a legitimate claim of entitlement to teaching abroad.  To the\ncontrary, Dr. Gruberโs contract stated that there was โno obligation for or guarantee of summer\nsession employment.โ (Doc. No. 88-2 at 4).  Mr. Smith never participated in study abroad activities\n(Doc. No. 81-14, Smith Dep. at 168) and so he never had even a unilateral expectation of going\noverseas as a part of his teaching duties.\nDr. Gruber has also not established that she was denied a grant.  What she was denied was\na โNon-Instructional Assignmentโ for research that allowed her to take time away from her teaching\nduties.  This apparently does not prevent her from applying for grants or other funding that would\nsupport her research and academic pursuits. (Doc. Nos.  81-13, Gruber Dep. 176-178; 62-22 at 3). \nNor has it been shown that the Dean auditing class is somehow the loss of a property interest. \nTo the contrary, Mr. Johnson testified that โof courseโ the Dean has the privilege to โdrop[] by my\nclass.โ  (Doc. No. 81-14, Johnson Dep. at 172).\nโOnly after a plaintiff has met the burden of demonstrating that he possessed a protected\nproperty or liberty interest and was deprived of that interest will the court consider whether the\nprocess provided the plaintiff in conjunction with the deprivation, or lack thereof, violated his rights\nto due process.โ   Hamilton v. Myers, 281 F.3d 520, 529 (6th Cir. 2002).  Because Plaintiffs have\nnot carried that burden, the Court could end here. However, as a matter of completeness, the Court\nnotes that Plaintiffs have not shown that they were deprived of adequate pre-deprivation procedures.\nPlaintiffs complain that they were investigated under an inapplicable policy because, on\nFebruary 24, 2021, they were informed that an investigation had commenced under Policy 141,\nProhibited Discrimination and Harassment.  However, the same letter to both Plaintiffs states that \n24\nCase 2:21-cv-00039   Document 90   Filed 12/01/22   Page 24 of 27 PageID #: 8936\n\nHuman Resources had received a complaint alleging misconduct in violation of Policy 202,\nAcademic Freedom and Responsibility, Policy 207, Tenured Faculty, and Policy 600, Code of\nConduct.  (Doc. No. 80-8 at 1, 3).  Those letters also plainly state, however, that the investigation\nwould be conducted under the โprocesses set forth in Policy 141, Prohibited Discrimination and\nHarassment.โ  (Id.) (emphasis added).  In other words, Policy 141 provided the process for\nconsidering whether they violated the code of conduct set forth in Policy 600.\nNext, Plaintiffs complain that Defendants overlooked or ignored information, including a\nโlist of documented reports of TPUSA officials at college campuses across the country espousing\nracism,โ and Dr. Donadioโs and Ms. Sciolisโ participation in the Fox News program.  (Doc. No. 80\nat 14).  Plaintiffs provide no cases suggesting that every kernel of information presented must be\nexamined analyzed when determining discipline.  This is likely because due process is a โflexible\ninquiry,โ with  โ[d]ifferent  circumstances call[ing] for different processes.โ  Cunningham v.\nBlackwell, 41 F.4th 530, 536 (6th Cir. 2022). โWhile โsome kind of a hearingโ generally must occur\nbefore the State fires a tenured employee . . . , the same is not true for other discipline.โ  Id..  \nTo succeed on their due process claim, Plaintiffs must show that they were denied โadequate\nprocedural rights to protect against an erroneous deprivation.โ    Kaplan, 10 F.4th at 577 (emphasis\nadded).  They have not done so.  Quite the contrary, the record reflects that Dr. Bruceโs was a\nconsidered decision.  Investigator Holt notified Plaintiffs of the Complaint and the procedural\nprocess to be followed, reviewed relevant materials (the flyer, the police report, and the security\nimages) and interviewed both witnesses and the Plaintiffs.  He drafted an investigation report to Dr.\nStinson who  forwarded it to Dr. Bruce.  Dr. Bruce then re-interviewed witnesses (Dr. Gruber, Mr.\nSmith, Ms. Sciolis, and Dr. Donadio), and reviewed the findings and investigative materials as well\n25\nCase 2:21-cv-00039   Document 90   Filed 12/01/22   Page 25 of 27 PageID #: 8937\n\nas TTU policies.  She also conferred with TTUโs Faculty Senate President and Faculty Trustee before\nmaking her final decision regarding discipline.  In short, Plaintiffs were provided all the process that\nwas due.\nFinally, Plaintiffs complain that their rights were somehow violated when Dr. Bruce rejected\ntheir appeal with the following three sentences:\nI received a formal written document appealing the disciplinary action related to Case\n# 2021-4 on June 17, 2021 via email from your lawyer, Mr. Robert Bigelow. I have\ncarefully reviewed the appeal documents that were submitted on your behalf and I\nhave also prudently reviewed the documentation related to the disciplinary action. I\nfound that the appropriate TTU policy (Policy 650) was in fact followed and that the\ndisciplinary action was reasonable and appropriate given the record.\n(Doc. No. 81- 12 at 1).  Not only do Plaintiffs cite no cases to support the proposition that a lengthy\ndiscourse  is  necessary  when  denying  an  appeal  for  reasons  already  given,  they  neglect  to\nacknowledge that they were each sent a 3-page letter from Dr. Bruce on May 13, 2021 that discusses\nher rationale imposing certain discipline.  Her rejection of the appeal required no further explanation. \nIII.  Conclusion\nOn the basis of the foregoing, Plaintiffsโ Motion for Summary Judgment will be denied while\nDefendantsโ Motions will be granted.  Further, because granting judgment in favor of Defendant\nmeans that Plaintiffs have no likelihood of success on the merits within the meaning of Rule 65(a)\nof the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Plaintiffsโ additional request for preliminary injunctive relief\nwill be denied.\nAn appropriate Order will enter.\n________________________________________________\nWAVERLY D.

Plaintiffs allege retaliation in violation of the First\nAmendment for their exercise of free speech and the denial of due process in violation of the\nFourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.  By way of this lawsuit, Plaintiffs seek to\nenjoin certain sanctions that have been imposed against them, such as โ1) Not being allowed to serve\nas a faculty advisor to any student organization at the university, including student clubs, student\nchapters of professional societies, and student honor societies, 2) Not being allowed to participate\nin study abroad activities, including faculty-led trips with students, 3) Not being eligible for\nnon-instructional faculty assignments, including university level awards of non-instructional faculty\nassignments or release from teaching duties for the purpose of administrative duties, 4) The\nCase 2:21-cv-00039   Document 42   Filed 01/26/22   Page 1 of 5 PageID #: 190\n\nrevocation of Dr. Gruberโs grant, 5) Requiring meetings to discuss their classroom behavior, 6)\nSubjecting them to unnecessary observation in the classroom, and 7) The threat of termination for\nfurther disciplinary actions.โ  (Doc. No. 40 at 2).\nDefendants have filed a โMotion for Partial Dismissalโ in which they request dismissal of\nโPlaintiffsโ claims against Tennessee Technological University, Dr. Gruber in her official capacity,\nand Dr. Oldham, in his official capacity.โ  (Doc. No. 34 at 1).  Defendants also request that they be\nallowed fourteen days from this Courtโs ruling on the motion within which to file an Answer\nbecause, while Rule 12(a)(4) automatically extends the period for responding to a complaint when\na motion to dismiss is filed, the rule does not indicate whether that extension applies to partial\nmotions as well.\nTurning to the procedural issue first, although โthere is limited authority on the point, . . . \nthe majority of federal courts that have addressed the issue have held that filing a partial motion to\ndismiss does indeed extend the time to file a responsive pleading with respect to all claims, including\nthose not addressed in the motion.โ Compton v. City of Harrodsburg, 287 F.R.D. 401, 402 (E.D. Ky.\n2012) (citing 5B Wright & Miller, FEDERAL PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE ยง 1346 (3d ed.)). As one\ncourt has explained, not permitting an extension for partial motions to dismiss could result in dual-\ntrack litigation whereby discovery is allowed on some but not all claims, and this could run afoul of\nRule 1โs command that the Federal Rules be construed to โโsecure the just, speedy, and inexpensive\ndetermination of every action and proceeding.โโ  Kent Intโl, Inc. v. United States, 161 F. Supp. 3d\n1340, 1342 (Ct. Intโl Trade 2016) (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 1).  Many decades ago, the district court\nin Gerlach v. Mich. Bell Tel. Co., 448 F. Supp. 1168, 1174 (E.D. Mich.1978) held otherwise, but\nthat case seemingly โstands alone like an Appaloosa in a herd of Thoroughbreds, and this Court\n2\nCase 2:21-cv-00039   Document 42   Filed 01/26/22   Page 2 of 5 PageID #: 191\n\ndeclines to follow its lead.โ  Compton, 287 F.R.D. at 402.\nResolution of the substantive issue is also relatively straightforward given the governing law.\nIn their response, โPlaintiffs agree that their claims against Tennessee Tech should be dismissedโ\nbut argue that โthe claims against Dr. Lori Bruce and Dr. Philip Oldham in their official capacities\nmust remain.โ  (Doc. No. 40 at 1, 4).  \nBy its very terms, an official capacity claim as permitted by the Ex Parte Young doctrine\nmeans that  โa federal court can issue prospective injunctive and declaratory relief compelling a state\nofficial to comply with federal lawโ even if that โcompliance might have an ancillary effect on the\nstate treasury[.]โ S & M Brands, Inc. v. Cooper, 527 F.3d 500, 507โ08 (6th Cir. 2008) (internal\ncitations omitted).  The difference between improper retroactive damages and those ancillary to a\nprospective relief claim has been described as follows:\nIn distinguishing between forbidden monetary relief and permissible injunctive relief,\nthe Supreme Court has explained that โ[r]elief that in essence serves to compensate\na party injured in the past by an action of a state official in his official capacity that\nwas illegal under federal law is barred even when the state official is the named\ndefendant.โ Papasan v. Allain, 478 U.S. 265, 278, 106 S. Ct. 2932, 92 L. Ed.2d 209\n(1986). โOn the other hand, relief that serves directly to bring an end to a present\nviolation of federal law is not barred by the Eleventh Amendment even though\naccompanied  by  a  substantial  ancillary  effect  on  the  state  treasury.โ  Id.  The\nancillary-effect exception, we have explained, โis a narrow one.โ Kelley v. Metro.\nCounty Bd. of Educ., 836 F.2d 986, 992 (6th Cir.1987). โThe dividing lineโ between\nancillary relief and essentially compensatory relief, we have also explained, โis\nwhether the money or the non-monetary injunction is the primary thrust of the suit.โ\nBarton v. Summers, 293 F.3d 944, 949 (6th Cir.2002); id. (โIf the injunctive relief\nsought by the plaintiff is truly prospective non-monetary relief, sovereign immunity\nwill not bar the suit simply because the state may be required to make incidental\nexpenditures in complying with the injunction.โ). We consider Eleventh Amendment\nimmunity, as well as any exceptions to it, on a claim-by-claim basis.\nErnst v. Rising, 427 F.3d 351, 367โ68 (6th Cir. 2005).\nGiven this authority, Plaintiffsโ claim against Dr. Oldham in his official capacity is clearly\n3\nCase 2:21-cv-00039   Document 42   Filed 01/26/22   Page 3 of 5 PageID #: 192\n\nsubject to dismissal.1  As to that Defendant, they simply allege:\n132. Dr. Oldham, the President of Tennessee Tech, unilaterally decided that anyone\nat Tennessee Tech who had been disciplined in the past year would not be eligible\nfor the $1,000 bonus normally received. \n133. Accordingly [because they were sanctioned by Dr. Bruce], Plaintiffs were both\ndenied a $1,000 bonus in May of 2021 due to the Sanctions and decisions of Dr.\nOldham.\n \n(Doc. No.  Amended Complaint ยถยถ 132-33).  A claim for the retroactive payment of a one-time\n$1,000 bonus that was not awarded for a prior yearโs service is simply not a claim for prospective\ninjunctive relief of which the money would be ancillary.  Rather, it is a request for relief that would\nserve to compensate plaintiff for a past injury and is barred by the Eleventh Amendment.  Papasan,\n478 U.S. at 278.  Plaintiffs present no real arguments to the contrary.\n The โthrustโ of the complaint against Dr. Bruce is entirely different, however.  She is the one\nwho imposed the sanctions identified at the start of this opinion that include non-monetary\npunishment, and she allegedly did so in violation of Plaintiffsโ free speech right and without due\nprocess.  While the Amended Complaintโs prayer for relief contains the phrase โmonetary losses,โ\nit does do in the context of requesting that โthe Court permanently enjoin Defendants from violating\nPlaintiffsโ rights or grant them other equivalent equitable relief, including monetary losses, and order\nDefendants to revoke all of the Sanctions imposed on Plaintiffs and reinstate Plaintiffs to their full\nteaching duties.โ  (Am. Cmpt. at 21).   โ[C]laims for reinstatement are prospective in nature and\n1Plaintiffsโ claim against Dr. Oldham in his individual capacity may be subject to dismissal as well. \nAn individual โis only liable for his or her own misconduct,โ Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 677 (2009),\nand โcase law teaches that in order to impose individual liability upon a [government official] for engaging\nin unconstitutional misconduct, it is a plaintiff's burden to specifically link the [officialโs] involvement to\nthe constitutional infirmity,โ Burley v. Gagacki, 834 F.3d 606, 615 (6th Cir. 2016).  However, Defendants\nhave not moved to dismiss the individual capacity claim against Dr. Oldham because, at the time of the filing\nof the motion to dismiss, he had not been served in his individual capacity.  (Doc 34 at 1).\n4\nCase 2:21-cv-00039   Document 42   Filed 01/26/22   Page 4 of 5 PageID #: 193\n\nappropriate subjects for Ex parte Young actions.โ  Carten v. Kent State Univ., 282 F.3d 391, 396 (6th\nCir. 2002)(citing Turker v. Ohio Depโt. of Rehab. and Corrs., 157 F.3d 453, 459 (6th Cir.1998)). \nBecause the โthrustโ of Plaintiffs real claim against Dr. Bruce is to right the alleged wrongs and\nthose include non-monetary damages, the Court cannot dismiss the official capacity claim against\nher.\nAccordingly, Defendantsโ Motion for Partial Dismissal (Doc. No. 34) is GRANTED IN\nPART and DENIED IN PART as follows: (1)  The Motion is GRANTED with respect to\nTennessee Board of Trustees d/b/a/ Tennessee Tech University, and that Defendant is hereby\nDISMISSED; (2) The Motion is GRANTED with respect to the official capacity claim against Dr.\nPhilip Oldham, and that claim is DISMISSED; and (3) The Motion is DENIED with respect to the\nofficial capacity claim against Dr. Lori Bruce.  Within fourteen (14) days of the date of entry of this\nOrder and Memorandum Opinion, the remaining Defendants shall file an Answer (or Answers) to\nthe Amended Complaint.\nIT IS SO ORDERED.\n__________________________________________\nWAVERLY D.

Professor Andrew Smith is a resident of Putnam County, Tennessee, and is a Senior \nInstructor of English at Tennessee Tech. \n  1 \nCase 2:21-cv-00039   Document 33   Filed 11/29/21   Page 1 of 22 PageID #: 139\n\n3.  Defendant Tennessee Tech is a public university doing business in Cookeville, Tennessee.   \n4.  Defendant  Board  of  Trustees  is  the  statutory  body  which  governs  the  control  and \nmanagement of Tennessee Tech, as provided by Tenn. Code Ann. ยง 49-8-101 et seq.     \n5.  Defendant Dr. Lori Bruce is an employee of Tennessee Tech, who in the scope of her job \nduties as Provost and Vice President for Academic Affairs, made decisions against the interests of \nPlaintiffs that violated their First Amendment rights. \n6.  Defendant Dr. Philip Oldham is an employee of Tennessee Tech, who in the scope of his \njob duties as President of Tennessee Tech, made decisions against the interests of Plaintiffs that \nviolated their First Amendment rights.   \n7.  Plaintiffs assert claims under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 against Defendants for retaliation in \nviolation of Plaintiffsโ Free Speech Rights pursuant to the First Amendment of the United States \nConstitution, and for violation of Plaintiffsโ Procedural Due Process rights pursuant to  the \nFourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution.  \n8.  This Court has jurisdiction over the Plaintiffsโ federal law claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง \n1331.   \n9.  Venue is proper in the Middle District of Tennessee, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 1391(b) \nbecause a substantial part of the events giving rise to these claims occurred in Putnam County, \nTennessee, and each of the Defendants reside or transact business in the Middle District of \nTennessee.   \n  2 \nCase 2:21-cv-00039   Document 33   Filed 11/29/21   Page 2 of 22 PageID #: 140\n\nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \nDr. Julia Gruber \n10.  Dr. Gruber is an Associate Professor of German at Tennessee Tech.  \n11.  Dr. Gruber is a tenured professor who has been working at Tennessee Tech for over 13 \nyears. \n12.  Dr. Gruber has received outstanding job evaluations, resulting in consistent pay raises since \nshe started working at Tennessee Tech in 2008. \n13.  Because of her outstanding performance, Dr. Gruber has been the highest paid faculty \nmember in her department for years, even though she is not the most senior faculty member. \n14.  Dr. Gruber expected to receive another raise in 2021, as well as a $1,000 bonus normally \ngiven to faculty who earn a satisfactory evaluation. \n15.  In 2020, Dr. Gruber was awarded a Non-Instructional Grant (the โGrantโ), which she chose \nto take in the Spring Semester of 2022.  She had never received this Grant before. \n16.  The Grant was awarded to Dr. Gruber after a committee of faculty members selected Dr. \nGruberโs proposal.  Her proposal focused on bringing African-American and Caucasian women \ntogether to discuss female anger at racism and misogyny.   \n17.  The  Grant  would  have  allowed  Dr.  Gruber  to  take  a  semester  off  from  teaching \nassignments, while being paid her regular monthly income of $5,416.84 (gross) or $3,859.12 \n(net).    \n18.  The Grant also provided Dr. Gruber an extra $4,000 to cover conference travel and \nexpenses to host a virtual workshop.   \n19.  Grants are highly competitive, and only a small number are awarded each year at Tennessee \nTech.   \n  3 \nCase 2:21-cv-00039   Document 33   Filed 11/29/21   Page 3 of 22 PageID #: 141\n\n20.  Grants are crucial for university professors as they allow them to free their schedules from \nteaching and service for one semester, to focus on research. \n21.  The three main areas that professors are evaluated on each year at Tennessee Tech are \nteaching, research, and service.  \n22.  Grants are a key determining factor when deciding which professors receive promotions. \n23.  Grants are also given substantial weight when universities make hiring decisions.      \n24.  After the Grant was approved, Dr. Gruber notified the Coalition of Women in German, an \norganization she is involved with, that she had been awarded the funds to organize the workshop.   \n25.  Dr. Gruber has taken Tennessee Tech students to Berlin (and Vienna) for study abroad trips \nalmost every year since 2009.  She was paid for organizing and conducting one of those trips.  \n26.  Some of her former students have written to her to express how much those trips changed \ntheir lives. \n27.  Dr. Gruber served as the Faculty Advisor of Tennessee Techโs German Club since 2008.   \n28.  Additionally, Dr. Gruber also served as the Faculty Advisor of Tennessee Techโs Lambda \nGay-Straight Alliance since 2012.   \nProfessor Andrew Smith \n29.  Professor Smith is a Senior Instructor of English.  He is a tenured professor and has worked \nat Tennessee Tech for approximately 20 years.  \n30.  Professor Smith has received consistent high evaluations, and merit raises of $1,000 for \nsatisfactory evaluations.   \n31.  Professor Smith has served as the Faculty Advisor for Tennessee Techโs Chapter of the \nNational Association of the Advancement of Colored People since 2017. \n  4 \nCase 2:21-cv-00039   Document 33   Filed 11/29/21   Page 4 of 22 PageID #: 142\n\n32.  Professor Smith has served as the Faculty Advisor for Tennessee Techโs Underrepresented \nNew and Creative Live Experiences Organization since 2011. \n33.  Professor Smith has served as the Faculty Advisor for Tennessee Techโs Presbyterian \nStudent Association since 2014. \n34.  Professor Smith served as the Faculty Advisor for Tennessee Techโs College Democrats \nfrom 2008 through 2011, and then again since 2020.   \n35.  Professor  Smith  served  as  the  Faculty  Advisor  for  Tennessee  Techโs  Student \nEnvironmental Action Coalition from 2010 through 2015, and then again since 2020.   \nAndrew Donadio and TPUSA \n36.  Dr. Andrew J. Donadio (โDr. Donadioโ) is an Assistant Professor of Nursing at Tennessee \nTech. \n37.  At all times pertinent hereto, Dr. Donadio served as a Putnam County Commissioner. \n38.  At all times pertinent hereto, Dr. Donadio served as Faculty Advisor of the Turning Point \nUSA (โTPUSAโ) Chapter at Tennessee Tech. \n39.  TPUSA is a national organization with chapters on college campuses.   \n40.  TPUSA, its founder and its members have a history of racism.  \n41.  Just a few years earlier, an incident occurred on the Tennessee Tech campus where a \nracially insensitive image and language were used to advertise an event held by the College \nRepublicans, and cosponsored by TPUSA.   \n42.  This incident was brought up during the January 27, 2021 Administrative Council meeting \nwhen the Constitution for Tennessee Techโs TPUSA chapter was approved.   \n43.  Former TPUSA national field director, Crystal Clanton, was caught saying, โI hate black \npeople. Like fuck them allโฆ I hate blacks. End of story.โ \n  5 \nCase 2:21-cv-00039   Document 33   Filed 11/29/21   Page 5 of 22 PageID #: 143\n\n44.  A former TPUSA Florida Field Director was filmed while attending TPUSAโs 2017 \nStudent Action Summit saying, โThe only thing the Nazis didnโt get right is that they didnโt keepโฆ \ngoing!โ \n45.  The President of a TPUSA chapter at the University of Nevada Las Vegas was caught on \nvideo shouting โwhite power.โ \n46.  A prominent TPUSA leader, Candace Owens, appeared to defend nationalism, saying that, \nโIf Hitler just wanted to make Germany great and have things run well, okay, fine.โ \n47.  The founder of TPUSA, Charlie Kirk, tweeted that its affiliate, Turning Point Action, \nwould be sending more than 80 buses to DC to โfight for the presidentโ and one of the men on \nthose buses was charged with assaulting Capitol police officers during the January 6th Capitol riot. \nThe Flyer Calling out Racism \n48.  On or about February 4, 2021, Dr. Donadio attended a Putnam County school board \nmeeting to discuss the removal of Algood Middle Schoolโs mascot, the โRedskins.โ \n49.  Dr. Gruber was also in attendance.     \n50.  Dr. Gruber was in favor of changing the mascot due to its racism and insensitivity towards \nNative Americans.  In fact, there was a Native American family present at the meeting.   \n51.  Dr. Donadio did not support changing the mascot, and applauded when the decision was \nmade to keep it in place.  \n52.  Dr. Gruber observed Dr. Donadioโs reaction, and discussed it with Professor Smith after \nthe meeting.   \n53.  Neither Dr. Gruber nor Professor Smith personally knew Dr. Donadio. \n54.  Dr. Gruber and Professor Smith researched the background of Dr. Donadio and TPUSA.   \n  6 \nCase 2:21-cv-00039   Document 33   Filed 11/29/21   Page 6 of 22 PageID #: 144\n\n55.  On or about February 5, 2021, Professor Smith made a flyer (the โFlyerโ) with a depiction \nof Dr. Donadio.  The Flyer read: \nThis racist college professor thought it would be a great idea to help start a \nTennessee Tech chapter for this national hate group, where racist students can \nunite to harass, threaten, intimidate, and terrorize persons of color, feminists, \nliberals, and the like, especially their teachers.  Their organization created a \nnational โProfessor Watchlistโ to harass and intimidate progressive educators, \nincluding many women, African-American, and Muslim professors. Professor \nDonadio and Turning Point USA. You are on our list. Your hate & hypocrisy are \nnot welcome at Tennessee Tech. No unity with racists. Hate speech is not free \nspeech. \n \n56.  On or about February 5, 2021, after Professor Smith showed the Flyer to Dr. Gruber, she \ndecided to distribute copies of it on tables and in the student lounge areas of Bell Hall. An hour \nand a half later, she returned to collect them. \n57.  That same day, Dr. Donadio filed a police report after being told about the Flyer by an I.T. \nworker.  \n58.  On or about February 6, 2021, Professor Smith distributed copies of the Flyer in the student \nunion building, Roaden University Center. \n59.  On or about February 9, 2021, Dr. Donadio filed a complaint with Defendantโs Department \nof Human Resources regarding the Flyer.  \nThe Investigation \n60.  On February 24, 2021, Mr. Greg Holt (โMr. Holtโ), Compliance Officer and Interim \nAssociate Vice President for Human Resources at Tennessee Tech, informed Plaintiffs via letter \n  7 \nCase 2:21-cv-00039   Document 33   Filed 11/29/21   Page 7 of 22 PageID #: 145\n\nthat the Office of Human Resources would be conducting a โthorough and impartial investigationโ \npursuant to Defendantโs Policy 141, Prohibited Discrimination and Harassment (โPolicy 141โ). \n61.  Policy 141 addresses โunlawful discrimination, harassmentโฆ on the basis of race, color, \nreligion, creed, ethnic or national origin, sex, disability, age, veteran status, genetic information, \nand any other category protected by federal or state civil rights laws. \n62.  Per Policy 141, โUpon receipt of a complaint, the Reporting Authority will determine \nwhether the complaint meets the definition of Discrimination, Harassment, or Retaliation as \ndefined [herein].โ  \n63.  Harassment  is  defined  in  Policy  141  as  โunwelcome  conduct  based  on  a  protected \ncategory.โ \n64.  Discrimination is defined in Policy 141 as โtreating a person differently than others based \non that individualโs legally protected status where such treatment is recognized by statute or \nregulation as potentially unlawful.โ \n65.  Plaintiffs did not discriminate or harass Dr. Donadio on the basis of his race, color, religion, \ncreed, ethnic or national origin, sex, disability, age, veteran status, or genetic information.   \n66.  Therefore, Plaintiffsโ actions did not meet the definition of Discrimination, Harassment or \nRetaliation as defined in Section IV of Policy 141.   \n67.  Policy 141 also insists that โTennessee Tech  will maintain the confidentiality of the \ncomplaint and the privacy of the persons involved.โ \n68.  The Flyer did not identify either Professor Smith or Dr. Gruber as its creator or distributor.  \n69.  Plaintiffsโ identities became public after TPUSA and Professor Donadio embarked on a \nmedia tour to identify and draw attention to Plaintiffs.  \n  8 \nCase 2:21-cv-00039   Document 33   Filed 11/29/21   Page 8 of 22 PageID #: 146\n\n70.  As a result of this media tour, Dr. Gruber and Professor Smith have had hate mail dropped \noff at their home and have received threatening phone calls to their office phones.   \n71.  As a result of this media tour, Plaintiffs have been mocked and threatened.   \n72.  Defendant did not maintain the confidentiality of the complaint, nor the privacy of the \npersons involved.  \n73.  In a February 24th letter, Defendant also informed Plaintiffs that they were specifically \nbeing investigated for alleged violations of Policy 202, Academic Freedom and Responsibility, \nSection III.D (โPolicy 202โ); Policy 207, Tenured Faculty, Section VIII.B. (โPolicy 207โ); and \nPolicy 600, Code of Conduct, Section III.E (โPolicy 600โ).  \n74.  Section VIII.B of Policy 207 lists various reasons that  a tenured professor  may be \nterminated for adequate cause.   \n75.  In such investigations, Policy 207 assures that โThe Office for Human Resources will seek \nexpert advice from concerned parties as appropriate, including but not limited to, law enforcement, \nthe Office of Research, deans, chairs/directors, faculty, and university counsel, before reporting its \nfindings to the Provost.โ \n76.  Additionally, โthe Provost shall, after conferring with the faculty senate president and the \nfaculty trustee, share the recommendations with the President as to whether the evidence supports \na conclusion of a violation of policy/policiesโฆ the President shall decide whether the evidence is \nsufficient to convene a hearing committee to consider whether adequate cause under [this policy] \nexists.โ \n77.  Policy 207 also ensures that if a hearing is convened, tenured professors are entitled to โa \nwritten statement of the specific charges alleged by Tennessee Tech that constitute grounds for \n  9 \nCase 2:21-cv-00039   Document 33   Filed 11/29/21   Page 9 of 22 PageID #: 147\n\ntermination and a notice of hearing specifying the time, date, and placeโฆ [and] the right to \nconfront and cross-examine all witnesses.โ  \n78.  On March 30, 2021, Professor Smith was notified that two Tennessee Tech students in the \nTPUSA Chapter at Tennessee Tech had filed complaints against him that were identical to the one \nfiled by Dr. Donadio.   \n79.  Mr. Holt told Professor Smith that, โI do not think it is necessary to interview you again.โ \n80.  Defendant also did not disclose any details or evidence included in the alleged student \ncomplaints other than their names: Gittle Sciolis and Jimmy Stewart. \n81.  On April 15, 2021, Defendant notified Professor Smith that the investigation had concluded \npursuant  to  Policy  141.   Defendant  also  provided  Professor  Smith  with  an  Investigation \nMemorandum (the โInvestigation Memorandumโ) reporting its findings.   \n82.  After an investigation, Mr. Holt found, in part, that โthe language of the Flyer was intended \nto harass, intimidate, and threaten Complainants as well as other faculty, staff, and students whose \nviews and opinions were contrary to those held by Respondents.โ \n83.  Dr. Claire Stinson (โDr. Stinsonโ), Vice President of Planning and Finance at Tennessee \nTech, accepted the recommendation of Mr. Holt that, in part, โthe language of the Flyer was \nintended to harass, intimidate, and threaten Complainants as well as other faculty, staff, and \nstudents whose views and opinions were contrary to those held by Respondents.โ \n84.  The Complainants do not qualify as a protected group under Policy 141. \n85.  Tennessee  Tech  informed  Plaintiffs  that  if  they  disagreed  with  the  findings  of  the \ninvestigation, they would only have five (5) business days to file a request for reconsideration in \nwriting.   \n  10 \nCase 2:21-cv-00039   Document 33   Filed 11/29/21   Page 10 of 22 PageID #: 148\n\n86.  The very next day, Plaintiffs filed a written request for reconsideration that outlined why \nthey believed the factual information and analysis included in the investigation was incomplete, \nand how the appropriate legal standards were incorrectly applied.   \n87.  Specifically, Plaintiffs pointed out that Policy 141 does not apply, and that their speech \nwas protected under the First Amendment.   \n88.  The first request was denied.  \n89.  Plaintiffs filed a second request for reconsideration of the Investigation Memorandumโs \nfindings on April 28, 2021.   \n90.  That request was also denied. \n91.  Plaintiffs were not allowed to address or question witnesses during the investigation. \n92.  Plaintiffs were not given a hearing during the investigation to defend themselves against \nthe charges. \n93.  Plaintiffs were not given a full and complete record of what evidence was being presented \nor reviewed during the investigation. \n94.  The  Investigation  Memorandum  determined  that  Plaintiffs  โcreated  the  Flyer  andโฆ \ndistributed the Flyers in Bell Hall where they would be seen by Complainantโs students and \ncolleagues,โ yet provides no evidence from student witnesses who actually saw the Flyer or were \nallegedly affected by it.   \n95.  The Investigation Memorandum only cited three (3) pieces of evidence, two of which were \ncopies of the Flyer itself.  The third piece of evidence was Dr. Donadioโs police report about the \nFlyer.  \n96.  The  Background  and  Evidence  sections  of  the  Investigation  Memorandum  were \napproximately two (2) pages long.   \n  11 \nCase 2:21-cv-00039   Document 33   Filed 11/29/21   Page 11 of 22 PageID #: 149\n\n97.  Still,  Defendantโs  investigation  determined  that  based  on  a  โpreponderance  of  the \nevidenceโ Plaintiffs had violated Policy 600, Code of Conduct.  \n98.  Policy  600  states  that,  โEmployees  are  expected  to  be  committed  to  creating  an \nenvironment that promotesโฆ diversity, fair treatment, and respect for all faculty, staff, students, \nand the general public.โ   \n99.  Plaintiffsโ Flyer promoted diversity and fair treatment by speaking out against racism, and \nvarious forms of bigotry Plaintiffs believed were espoused by Dr. Donadio and TPUSA. \n100.  Still, Defendant determined that Plaintiffsโ speaking out did not create โan environment \nthat promotesโฆ diversity, fair treatment, and respect for all faculty, staff, studentsโฆโ but rather, \nโthe content of the Flyer was intended to harass, intimidate, and threatenโ Dr. Donadio and others \nwith different views and opinions.   \n101.  No finding explained how the Flyer was intended to harass. \n102.  No finding explained how the Flyer was intended to intimidate. \n103.  No finding explained how the Flyer was intended to threaten. \n104.  No finding was made as to which complainants felt harassed. \n105.  No finding was made as to which complainants felt intimidated. \n106.  No finding was made as to which complainants felt threatened. \n107.  Tennessee Techโs Policy 200, Academic Freedom and Responsibility, Section III.C insists, \nโWhen the faculty member speaks or writes as a citizen, he/she should be free from Tennessee \nTech censorship or disciplineโฆ [as long as the faculty member] make[s] every effort to indicate \nthat he/she does not speak for Tennessee Tech.โ \n108.  Plaintiffs did not indicate in any way, shape, or form, that they spoke for Tennessee Tech \non the Flyer, nor did they harass, intimidate, or threaten anyone. \n  12 \nCase 2:21-cv-00039   Document 33   Filed 11/29/21   Page 12 of 22 PageID #: 150\n\n109.  By disciplining Plaintiffs, Defendants violated their own policies.   \n110.  TPUSA has a record of harassing and intimidating others who have different views and \nopinions. \n111.  TPUSA hosts a โProfessor Watchlistโ website that features a list of college professors who \nTPUSA believes โadvance leftist propaganda in the classroom.โ The websiteโs self-stated goal is \nto โexpose and documentโ such professors for their views and opinions. \n112.  At the January 27, 2021 Administrative Council meeting when TPUSAโs Tennessee Tech \nchapter was approved, the โProfessor Watchlistโ was discussed in depth. \n113.  Ms. Gittle Sciolis, President of Tennessee Techโs TPUSA chapter, addressed a question \nabout what would happen if one of Defendantโs professors were added to the watchlist. \n114.  Ms. Sciolis insisted that it was very hard to get on the watchlist, and that a professor would \nhave to be antisemitic or racist against a student to be added. \n115.  Vice  President  of  Tennessee  Techโs  TPUSA  chapter,  Jimmy  Steward,  added  that  a \nprofessor would have to be very radical or extreme on multiple occasions to get put on TPUSAโs \nwatchlist. \n116.  Nevertheless, TPUSA published profiles for both Professor Smith and Dr. Gruber on its \nProfessor Watchlist website. \n117.  Dr. Gruber and Professor Smith have had hate mail dropped off at their home.  They have \nbeen mocked and threatened. \n118.  Tennessee Techโs Policy 007 claims that Defendant โis committed to maintaining a campus \nas a marketplace of ideas for all Students and Faculty in which the free exchange of ideas is not to \nbe suppressed because the ideas put forth are thought by some or even most members of Tennessee \n  13 \nCase 2:21-cv-00039   Document 33   Filed 11/29/21   Page 13 of 22 PageID #: 151\n\nTechโs community to be offensive, unwise, immoral, indecent, disagreeable, conservative, liberal, \ntraditional, radical or wrong-headed.โ   \n119.  Tennessee Techโs Policy 007 also claims, โTech will not use concerns about civility and \nmutual respect as justification for closing off the discussion of ideas, however offensive, \nunwise, immoral, indecent, disagreeable, conservative, liberal, traditional, radical or wrong-\nheaded those ideas may be to some Students or Faculty.โ \n120.  Still, Tennessee Tech only chose to target Plaintiffs for punishment of their ideas. \nDefendants Punish Plaintiffs for Exercising their Free Speech Rights \n121.  On or about May 13, 2021, Dr. Bruce instituted significant sanctions (the โSanctionsโ) \nagainst Plaintiffs that are currently scheduled to last for two (2) years. \n122.  The Sanctions strike at the heart of who Dr. Gruber and Professor Smith are as educators.   \n123.  Plaintiffs are banned from serving as Faculty Advisors to any student organization.   \n124.  Dr. Gruber can no longer serve as Faculty Advisor to the German Club or Lambda Gay-\nStraight Alliance, organizations she had previously been involved with for more than a decade.   \n125.  Professor Smith can no longer serve as Faculty Advisor for the National Association of the \nAdvancement  of  Colored  People,  Underrepresented  New  and  Creative  Live  Experiences, \nPresbyterian  Student  Association,  College  Democrats,  and  Student  Environmental  Action \nCoalition.   \n126.  Plaintiffs are not allowed to participate in study abroad activities or faculty-led trips.   \n127.  Dr. Gruber can no longer take students to Berlin and Vienna as she previously did.   \n128.  Plaintiffs are not eligible to receive non-instructional faculty assignments or awards.   \n129.  Dr. Gruberโs hard-earned Grant was revoked as part of these Sanctions.   \n  14 \nCase 2:21-cv-00039   Document 33   Filed 11/29/21   Page 14 of 22 PageID #: 152\n\n130.  Dr. Gruber has had to cancel the workshop she planned and will need to take on teaching \nassignments in the Spring Semester of 2022 to earn her full salary now that the Grant has been \nrevoked.   \n131.  Plaintiffs are not eligible for salary increases for one (1) year.   \n132.  Dr.  Oldham,  the  President  of  Tennessee  Tech,  unilaterally  decided  that  anyone  at \nTennessee Tech who had been disciplined in the past year would not be eligible for the $1,000 \nbonus normally received.   \n133.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs were both denied a $1,000 bonus in May of 2021 due to the \nSanctions and decisions of Dr. Oldham.   \n134.  The Sanctions will cause Plaintiffs to suffer a decrease in pay that they would not have \nexperienced absent these Sanctions.  \n135.  Plaintiffs are required to attend meetings so that โpersonal grievancesโ are not โbrought \ninto the classroom.โ \n136.  Plaintiffs are required to meet with the Dean at the beginning and end of the Fall 2021 \nsemester to discuss their behavior in the classroom. \n137.  Plaintiffs will be subject to observation in the classroom.   \n138.  Dr. Bruce also warned Plaintiffs that โAny further violations by [them]... will result in \nfurther disciplinary actions which could include termination of employment.โ \n139.  In determining what punishment to impose, Dr. Bruce only reviewed security videos, the \n2-page investigation materials, and interviews from the Plaintiffs and โemployee and student \ncomplainants.โ   \n  15 \nCase 2:21-cv-00039   Document 33   Filed 11/29/21   Page 15 of 22 PageID #: 153\n\n140.  Dr. Bruce also referred to โseveral public communications [Plaintiffs] made on [the] \nmatter,โ but only alludes to a letter written by Dr. Gruber to an unidentified local newspaper, and \nunspecified interviews given on social media.   \n141.  Dr. Bruce also reviewed materials and evidence that were entirely irrelevant and should \nnot have been in Professor Smithโs records, when determining what punishment to impose on \nhim.   \n142.  In Dr. Bruceโs May 13, 2021 letter to Professor Smith, she referenced a letter of reprimand \nthat had been placed in his personnel file on May 27, 2005, as one of the factors she considered \nwhen determining what appropriate punishment should be imposed against Professor Smith. \n143.  This letter was never presented to Professor Smith in this investigation as evidence to be \nused against him.   \n144.  Following the incident in 2005, Professor Smith was put on a two-year probationary period, \nafter which he could have the letter of reprimand removed from his file if he met certain conditions \nrequired by Defendant.  \n145.  On August 19, 2010, Jack Armistead, Defendantโs Provost and VPAA, sent confirmation \nvia e-mail to Human Resources and Professor Smith that the incident from 2005 should be \nremoved from Professor Smithโs personnel file.   \n146.  Specifically,  Mr.  Armistead  noted,  โThose  conditions  have  been  met,  and  I  hereby \nauthorize Human Resources to remove the document from Mr. Smithโs file.โ  \n147.  In spite of written assurances that the letter was removed from his personnel records, Dr. \nBruce cited that letter as a crucial piece of evidence used in her determination of what punishment \nto impose on Professor Smith.  \n  16 \nCase 2:21-cv-00039   Document 33   Filed 11/29/21   Page 16 of 22 PageID #: 154\n\n148.  Additionally, Dr. Bruce cited a previous incident where Dr. Gruber allegedly violated \nDefendantโs Code of Conduct a few years earlier, following an anonymous student complaint that \nshe misused class time.   \n149.  The complaint referred to when Dr. Gruber raised concerns with her students after some \ncomplained of health issues following Tennessee Techโs switch to using cleaning products that \ncontained pesticides.   \n150.  However, a report filed by Betsy Smith, an external investigator, with Tennessee Techโs \nHuman Resources Department on January 8, 2020, noted that this incident had been investigated \nby Mr. Holt.  Mr. Holt previously determined that there was not sufficient evidence to support a \nfinding of a Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act or TTU Policy Violation.  The Provost \nand President determined that Dr. Gruber did not do anything warranting punishment.   \n151.  Still, this incident was mentioned as a factor that Dr. Bruce took into account when \ndetermining what sanctions to impose on Dr. Gruber.   \n152.  Finally, Dr. Bruce concluded that Plaintiffsโ actions were based on a personal grievance \nthey had with Dr. Donadio, even though neither Dr. Gruber nor Professor Smith knew, or \npersonally knows, Dr. Donadio.   \n153.  Plaintiffs filed an appeal to Dr. Jennifer Taylor (โDr. Taylorโ), Vice President of the Office \nof Research and Economic Development at Tennessee Tech, on June 17, 2021.   \n154.  Dr. Taylor is a Vice President in the Office of Research and Economic Development. \n155.  On July 6, 2021, Defendant wrote to Plaintiffs informing them in three sentences that their \nappeal was denied by Dr. Taylor.   \n156.  Dr. Taylor did not explain why the appeal was denied. \n157.  Dr. Taylor did not address any of the arguments raised in Plaintiffโs appeal.   \n  17 \nCase 2:21-cv-00039   Document 33   Filed 11/29/21   Page 17 of 22 PageID #: 155\n\n158.  Dr. Taylor simply wrote, โI found that the appropriate TTU policy (Policy 650) was in fact \nfollowed and that the disciplinary action was reasonable and appropriate given the record.โ  \nCAUSES OF ACTION \nCOUNT I: First Amendment Retaliation Under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 \n159.  Plaintiff repeat and reallege each and every allegation hereinabove as if fully set forth \nherein. \n160.   The Plaintiffsโ Flyer was protected speech under the First Amendment of the United States \nConstitution.  \n161.  The Flyer addressed a matter of public concern, rather than a personal grievance.   \n162.  Plaintiffs were commenting on their perception that Tennessee Tech was tolerating a group, \nled by Dr. Donadio, with a history of racism.   \n163.  Plaintiffs were speaking on behalf of the minority students and faculty who they believed \nto be targeted by TPUSAโs views.    \n164.  Neither Dr. Gruber or Professor Smith personally knew (or knows) Dr. Donadio.   \n165.  Neither Dr. Gruber or Professor Smith personally knew the student complainants.   \n166.  Plaintiffsโ speech on the Flyer was voiced as private citizens, not pursuant to the Plaintiffsโ \njob duties.  \n167.  Plaintiffsโ speech interests outweigh Defendantโs efficiency interest as an employer.  \n168.   Plaintiffs identities would not have become known but for Defendant Tennessee Techโs \ninvestigation as to their identity. \n169.  Plaintiffs were speaking as private citizens on a matter of public concern, and the Flyer did \nnot interfere with Defendantโs regular operations, nor did it cause a disruption on campus.  \n170.  The Flyer was only initially seen by a few people.   \n  18 \nCase 2:21-cv-00039   Document 33   Filed 11/29/21   Page 18 of 22 PageID #: 156\n\n171.  The Flyer was not distributed while teaching in the classroom.   \n172.  The Flyer was not sponsored by Tennessee Tech, and Plaintiffs did not speak on behalf of \nthe Defendants.   \n173.  The only publicity and national attention brought to the matter was a result of TPUSA and \nDr. Donadioโs embarking on a media tour to draw attention to it.   \n174.  Plaintiffs suffered adverse actions intended to chill their speech when Defendants punished \nthem for the aforementioned speech that is protected under the First Amendment of the United \nStates Constitution.  \n175.  Plaintiffs received a written warning accompanied by the threat of termination if their \nspeech continued.  Specifically, the May 13 letter that Dr. Bruce sent to Plaintiffs warned them: \nth\nโThe above listed sanctions will remain in place for the next two academic yearsโฆ Any further \nviolations by you of the employee code of conductโฆ will result in further disciplinary actions \nwhich could include termination of employment.โ \n176.  Plaintiffs  suffered  a  decrease  in  pay  when  Defendants  punished  them  for  their \nconstitutionally protected speech.   \n177.  Plaintiffs have three areas of job responsibilities at Tennessee Tech: teaching, research, and \nservice.  As a result of Defendantsโ Sanctions, Plaintiffs have essentially had two of those three \nareas (research and service) severely restricted. \n178.  Dr. Bruce, while acting in her individual and official capacity, acted under the color of state \nlaw when she instituted Sanctions against Plaintiffs in retaliation for the aforementioned speech \nthat is protected under the First Amendment of the United States Constitution.   \n  19 \nCase 2:21-cv-00039   Document 33   Filed 11/29/21   Page 19 of 22 PageID #: 157\n\n179.  Dr. Oldham, while acting in his individual and official capacity, acted under the color of \nstate law when he revoked Plaintiffsโ bonus due to Defendantโs punishment of the aforementioned \nspeech that is protected under the First Amendment of the United States Constitution.   \n180.  The constitutionally protected speech was the motivating factor for Defendantsโ decision \nto discipline and punish Plaintiffs. \n181.  By depriving Plaintiffs of their constitutional rights, Defendants violated 42 U.S.C. ยง \n1983.  \nCOUNT II: Denial of Procedural Due Process in Violation of the Fourteenth Amendment \nand 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 \n182.  Plaintiffs repeat and reallege each and every allegation hereinabove as if fully set forth \nherein. \n183.  As tenured professors, Plaintiffs have a property interest in their continued employment \nthat is protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States \nConstitution.  \n184.  Plaintiffs also have a property interest in Tennessee Tech complying with its own policies, \nwhich is protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States \nConstitution.  \n185.  Defendants, via their policies and procedures, did not provide Plaintiffs with a meaningful \nopportunity to be heard before depriving them of their protected property interests. \n186.  Defendants did not allow Plaintiffs to cross examine or even write written questions to any \ncomplainant, despite the fact that credibility was an issue. \n187.  Defendants did not provide Plaintiffs with a full record to allow them to rebut accusations. \n  20 \nCase 2:21-cv-00039   Document 33   Filed 11/29/21   Page 20 of 22 PageID #: 158\n\n188.  Defendants did not provide Professor Smith with the May 13, 2021 letter of reprimand that \nwas used as evidence against him in the investigation for the flyer. \n189.  Defendants did not provide Dr. Gruber with the earlier student complaint about her alleged \nmisuse of class time that was later used as evidence against her in the investigation for the flyer. \n190.  Defendants acted under the color of state law when they deprived Plaintiffs of their \nprotected property interests.  \n191.  As a result of Defendantsโ conduct, Plaintiffs have suffered and will suffer loss of earnings, \njob experience, and benefits that they would have enjoyed absent such conduct. \n192.  By depriving Plaintiffs of their constitutional rights, Defendants violated 42 U.S.C. ยง \n1983.  \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully request the following relief: \n1.  That the Court declare that Defendants violated 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983; \n2.  That the Court permanently enjoin Defendants from violating Plaintiffsโ rights or grant \nthem other equivalent equitable relief, including monetary losses, and order Defendants to revoke \nall of the Sanctions imposed on Plaintiffs and reinstate Plaintiffs to their full teaching duties; \n3.  An award of attorneysโ fees, costs, and litigation expenses pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1988; \n4.  Such other legal or equitable relief as this Court deems appropriate. \n \n  21 \nCase 2:21-cv-00039   Document 33   Filed 11/29/21   Page 21 of 22 PageID #: 159\n\nRespectfully Submitted this 23rd day of November, 2021, \n \n/s Robert C.
