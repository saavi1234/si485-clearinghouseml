Having reviewed the parties' pre-motion letters, dated May 20, 2022 and May 25, 2022, the Court has determined that defendants may bring their motion without the necessity of a pre-motion conference. Plaintiffs are reminded that if, consistent with Rule 11, they can assert additional allegations to cure any alleged deficiencies raised by defendants' letter, it would be in the best interest of both the parties and the Court for plaintiffs to assert them now, before briefing on the proposed motions. Plaintiffs are thus granted leave to file an amended complaint within two weeks of this Order. At that time, if no amended complaint has been filed, the parties should confer on a briefing schedule agreeable to both sides, in which no more than sixty days elapse from the filing of defendants' motion to the filing of defendants' reply..

Under Railroad Comm'n of Texas v. Pullman Co., 312 U.S. 496, 500 (1941) and its progeny, \"federal courts should abstain when litigants challenge state actions on federal constitutional grounds in federal court and the answer to an unsettled question of state law might eliminate the need to decide the federal constitutional question or materially alter the way the federal court would view that question.\" 17A Moore's Federal Practice - Civil ยง122.20. As the parties may be aware, federal courts are permitted to raise the issue of abstention sua sponte. See Catlin v. Ambach, 820 F.2d 588, 591 (2d Cir. 1987). Each party is directed to file submissions no longer than ten (10) pages on February 3, 2023. Each party may also file a rebuttal submission no longer than five (5) pages on February 10, 2023. The Court will inform the parties if it believes that oral argument would be valuable..(ama) (Entered: 01/20/2023)"

ENDORSEMENT: We are in receipt of plaintiffs' letter, dated April 11, 2023, which requests additional time to respond to the Court's inquiries concerning their proposed class action motion. See ECF No. 74. While the Court is unclear about the connection between the issues raised regarding plaintiffs' proposed motion and the filing of defendants' answer, we have no objection to plaintiffs' request. Plaintiffs' letter addressing the necessity and/or timing of a class certification motion is due one week from the defendants' answer, which defendants have proposed to file this Friday, April 14. See ECF No. 72. We also take this occasion to bring Judge Friendly's opinion in Galvan v. Levine, to the parties' attention, which more artfully states one of the points the Court was trying to make in its April 3, 2023 call with the parties: [I]nsofar as the relief sought is prohibitory, an action seeking declaratory or injunctive relief against state officials on the ground of unconstitutionality of a statute or administrative practice is the archetype of one where class action designation is largely a formality, at least for the plaintiffs. 490 F.2d 1255, 1261 (2d Cir. 1973); see also Davis v. Smith, 607 F.2d 535, 540 (2d Cir. 1978) (\"Where retroactive monetary relief is not at issue and the prospective benefits of declaratory and injunctive relief will benefit all members of a proposed class to such an extent that the certification of a class would not further the implementation of the judgment, a district court may decline certification.\") (Signed by Judge Naomi Reice Buchwald on 4/12/2023) (tg) (Entered: 04/12/2023)"

    "summary": "<p>On March 21, 2022, a class of New York City residents filed a lawsuit in the Southern District of New York against the City of New York and various City law enforcement officials. Plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief to end the NYPD&rsquo;s practice of taking and analyzing DNA from predominantly black and Latinx New Yorkers without a warrant or court order. Represented by The Legal Aid Society, plaintiffs alleged violations of their rights under the Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution and Article 49-B of New York law (Commission on Forensic Science and Establishment of DNA Identification Index).&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>In their complaint, plaintiffs alleged that NYPD detectives secretly took DNA samples from people suspected of committing crimes. An example of their collection approach involved a 12-year-old boy the NYPD suspected of committing a crime. In an interrogation room, detectives gave him a soda to drink. DNA evidence from his straw ultimately did not match the DNA evidence at the crime scene, but the boy&rsquo;s DNA was still stored in the Office of Chief Medical Examiner&rsquo;s (OCME) Suspect Index where it could be compared against future crime scene evidence. Plaintiffs alleged that the NYPD is incentivized to collect as much DNA as possible because the City&rsquo;s growing use of investigative genetic genealogy (IGG) could identify family members and distant relatives of a person whose DNA is in the NYPD&rsquo;s database. Plaintiffs alleged that maintaining this Suspect Index amounted to an unauthorized expansion of the national DNA database system created by and regulated through federal and state law (New York law prohibits inclusion of DNA profiles from arrestees and suspects in its State DNA Index Systems).&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The same day that the plaintiffs filed their complaint, they also filed a motion for class certification. On June 13, 2022, District Judge Naomi Reice Buchwald denied that motion without prejudice to its renewal after the Court&rsquo;s resolution on Defendants&rsquo; motion to dismiss. Defendants filed their motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction on July 15, 2022.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>As of December 2022, this case is ongoing.</p>",

This class-action, civil rights lawsuit challenges New York Cityโs policy and \npractice  of  secretly  taking  and  analyzing  the  DNA  of  people  whom  the  police  suspect  of \ncommitting a crime without a warrant or court order and maintaining this DNA in an index where \nit is perpetually compared to past and future crime scene evidence. Through this practice, the City \nhas seized the DNA of thousands of unsuspecting, primarily Black and Latinx New Yorkers, and \nturned them into permanent criminal suspects.  \n2.  For years now, New York City Police Department (โNYPDโ) detectives have \ntargeted unsuspecting New Yorkers, including young children, by bringing them into interrogation \n  1 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-02305   Document 1   Filed 03/21/22   Page 2 of 24\n \nrooms that have been prepared in advance to capture saliva, skin cells, or other genetic material. \nIn these interrogation rooms, detectives offer people cigarettes and drinks to secretly collect their \nDNA. In one example, detectives handed a 12-year-old boy a McDonaldโs soda and, after the boy \ndrank from it and was escorted out the room, they secretly removed the straw for DNA testing and \nplaced the boyโs DNA in an index of people suspected of criminal activity (โthe Suspect Indexโ).   \n3.  The NYPD sends these DNA samples to the Office of Chief Medical Examiner \n(โOCMEโ), which analyzes the samples, creates a DNA profile, and compares that profile to crime \nscene DNA evidence in perpetuity. Through the Suspect Index, the NYPD and OCME partner to \nput peopleโs DNA profiles through a genetic lineup that compares the profiles against all past and \nfuture crime scene DNA evidenceโall without obtaining a warrant or court order to conduct these \nDNA searches.  \n4.  The Suspect Index is illegal. Unlike state and federal DNA index systems, the \nCityโs  Suspect  Index  lacks  legislative  authorization.  As  a  result,  it  operates  without  any \nindependent oversight. New York law prohibits the indexing of a personโs DNA unless the person \nhas been convicted of a crime. Nonetheless, the Cityโs Suspect Index ignores state laws and \nregulations that limit DNA indexing and hoards the DNA of arrestees and suspects. Without any \nindependent oversight, the NYPD and OCME have additionally deployed a new and invasive \ninvestigatory technique using DNA samples to investigate a suspectโs entire family. \n5.  Because of a history of institutional racism and disparities in arrest rates in New \nYork City, Black and Latinx people make up the vast majority of arrestees who are subject to the \nCityโs DNA taking and indexing practice. And, with the Cityโs new genealogical investigative \ntechnique, the parents, grandparents, siblings, children, and even the distant relatives of suspects \nand arrestees can be swept into the Cityโs genetic investigations.  \n  2 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-02305   Document 1   Filed 03/21/22   Page 3 of 24\n \n6.  The Defendants have violated and continue to violate the Plaintiffsโ rights under \nthe Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution and their rights under New York law.  \nPlaintiffs seek injunctive and declaratory relief to end the Cityโs practice of targeting thousands of \nindividuals, many of whom have never been convicted of a crime, to take their DNA and turn them \ninto permanent suspects. \nPARTIES  \n \n7.

The NYPD has an established practice and procedure for secretly taking a personโs \ninvoluntarily shed DNA for comparison against all crime scene evidence involving DNA. The \nNYPD Detective Guide (โthe Guideโ) provides instructions for secretly taking a personโs DNA \nwhen they are in a controlled environment, like a police precinct, and when they are in a non-\ncontrolled environment, like a coffee shop.  \n  4 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-02305   Document 1   Filed 03/21/22   Page 5 of 24\n \n16.  In most cases, NYPD detectives take a personโs DNA after bringing them to the \npolice  precinct.  The  Guide  instructs  detectives  to  clean  a  precinctโs  interrogation  room  by \nremoving any used drinking containers or other trash and any used ashtrays. Detectives then must \nuse Clorox wipes to clean any tabletops, desks, and chairs, and place an unused disposable ashtray \non the table. With these measures, the trap is set to capture a personโs DNA.  \n17.  When a person is in the interrogation room, the Guide instructs detectives to \nโ[p]rovide the suspect with an object that will be partially consumed (e.g., cigarette, chewing gum, \napple) or a container filled with a beverage (e.g., water in a plastic cup, soda in a can, coffee in a \nStyrofoam  cup,  juice  in  a  plastic  bottle).โ  It  then  instructs  detectives  to  maintain  constant \nobservation of the person until they can collect the item. In practice, NYPD officers do not allow \npeople to take the used items with them when they leave the interrogation room. After the \ninterrogation, the Guide instructs detectives to collect the personโs involuntarily shed DNA sample \nby putting on gloves and placing the object with the DNA sample in an evidence bag.  \n18.  For years now, NYPD detectives have followed the Guideโs instructions to target \nwhomever they choose and secretly take their DNA. In total, thousands of people, including \nchildren, have had their DNA taken by the NYPD pursuant to this policy and practice.  \n19.  In March 2018, for example, NYPD detectives interrogated a 12-year-old boy they \nsuspected of having committed a crime and took his DNA, according to reporting by the New York \nTimes. In the interrogation room, detectives handed him a McDonaldโs soda. The boy drank the \nsoda and ultimately was escorted out of the room by police. Without the knowledge or consent of \nthe boy or his parents, detectives removed the straw from the soda and had the DNA sample from \nthe straw compared to DNA evidence found at the crime scene. The boyโs DNA did not match the \ncrime scene DNA and the charges against him were dropped. However, following the NYPDโs \n  5 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-02305   Document 1   Filed 03/21/22   Page 6 of 24\n \npolicy, OCME proceeded to store the boyโs DNA in its Suspect Index, making him a suspect in \nfuture criminal cases involving DNA. His DNA remained in the Suspect Index for more than a \nyear where it was compared against tens of thousands of crime scene samples until his parents \nwere finally able to get it expunged.  \n20.  In another  example, detectives  were caught on  videotape  scrubbing  clean an \ninterrogation room table and placing a new ashtray on the table before escorting a man into the \nroom. NYPD video footage released to the public shows a detective providing the man a cigarette, \nwhich he smokes and puts out in the ashtray.1 After cuffing the manโs hands behind his back and \nescorting him out of the room, the detective returns with gloves on his hands and places the \ncigarette butt in an evidence bag.  \n21.  According to NYPD policy and practice, detectives have the discretion to take the \nDNA of any adult whom they suspect of committing any crime, and the discretion to take the DNA \nof any minor they suspect of committing a felony or certain specified misdemeanors. No warrant \nor  court  order  is  required.  No  supervisor  approval  or  other  additional  process  is  required. \nDetectives only have to obtain supervisor approval before taking the DNA of a minor suspected \nof committing a misdemeanor that is not specified in the Guide.  \n22.  Even when someone has explicitly refused to consent to providing a DNA sample, \nNYPD detectives have circumvented that refusal by simply taking the personโs DNA without their \nknowledge. NYPD detectives even circumvent refusals to take the DNA of children. In a February \n2020 New York City Council hearing, senior NYPD officials admitted to giving NYPD detectives \nthe discretion to secretly take a childโs DNA after the child and their parent have refused to provide \nit.  \n \n1 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ww_npq7h_to  \n  6 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-02305   Document 1   Filed 03/21/22   Page 7 of 24\n \n23.  After detectives secretly collect an object with a personโs DNA sample, they deliver \nit to OCME. OCME, pursuant to its own published manuals, then analyzes the DNA sample, which \nincludes extracting the DNA, creating a DNA profile, and comparing it against DNA evidence in \nthe case in which the person is a suspect. OCME then, again pursuant to its own published manuals, \nuploads the personโs DNA profile to the Suspect Index to continuously compare the personโs DNA \nprofile against all past and future crime scene DNA evidence. Once uploaded to the Suspect Index, \nthe personโs DNA profile can remain there indefinitely, even if that personโs charges are dismissed. \nThe Suspect Index thus operates like a genetic lineup that continuously compares the DNA profiles \nof thousands of New Yorkers, including children and individuals with no criminal history, against \ntens of thousands of crime scene DNA samples.  \n24.  OCME officials know that the NYPD routinely takes the involuntarily shed DNA \nof suspects without a warrant or court order and that the Suspect Index it maintains is comprised \nof such DNA. In written testimony submitted to the New York City Council in February 2020, the \nformer Assistant Laboratory Director of OCME and creator of the original OCME local database \nsystem, publicly raised ethical and civil liberties concerns regarding the NYPDโs tactics for \nobtaining DNA samples and the transformation of the Suspect Index into โa vast repository of \nDNA from dragnets, surreptitious collection, and collection from children.โ  \n25.  Nonetheless, OCME has continued its partnership with the NYPD to subject people \nto continuous genetic lineups without their knowledge or consent, including children. For example, \nin August 2020, J.B., a 15-year-old boy from the Bronx who has special educational needs, was \narrested on his way to a deli. He was brought to the police precinct on weapons charges and \nprocessed as an alleged juvenile delinquent. J.B. had never been arrested before and had no prior \ncontact with the criminal or family court systems. Sweating and frightened, he waited in a room \n  7 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-02305   Document 1   Filed 03/21/22   Page 8 of 24\n \nuntil police officers offered him a bottle of Coca-Cola, which he quickly accepted and drank. \nAlmost immediately, the officers returned, told him they were not supposed to give him the bottle, \nand demanded it back. He gave the bottle back to the officers. J.B. didnโt realize it then, but this \nhad been a ruse to obtain his DNA. \n26.  The officers never asked J.B. for his consent before secretly taking his DNA. \nAlthough J.B.โs mother had rushed to the precinct to be with her son, the NYPD never asked for \nher consent either. After taking his DNA, the NYPD then sent it to OCME for processing. But \nOCME never compared J.B.โs DNA to any evidence in his case. Instead, OCME uploaded his \nDNA profile to the Suspect Index. When J.B., through his attorneys, discovered that his DNA was \nin the Suspect Index, he sent a letter to OCME requesting that his DNA profile be removed from \nthe index. OCME refused to do so without a court order. After J.B. filed an Article 78 petition in \nNew York State Supreme Court seeking such an order, OCME finally consented to remove his \nprofile. By then, his DNA had been compared to tens of thousands of crime scene evidence, for \nwhich there was no reason to suspect his involvement. \n27.  The Defendantsโ policy and practice of testing peopleโs DNA without their consent \nand without a warrant or a court order ignores state law privacy protections applicable to all New \nYorkers, including suspects and arrestees. Under New York Civil Rights Law 79-L, New York \nState prohibits genetic testing, including โDNA profile analysis,โ of any personโs biological \nmaterial known to contain DNA without the personโs written informed consent, unless permitted \nby court order or under state law provisions authorizing such testing for people convicted of \ncrimes. The Legislature included these limited exceptions to the civil rights law โto balance the \nrights of the individual with the legitimate interests of our criminal justice system,โ according to \nthe lawโs sponsor in the State Senate. But the Defendants have far exceeded those limits.  \n  8 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-02305   Document 1   Filed 03/21/22   Page 9 of 24\n \nThe Suspect Index Unlawfully Expands Beyond Lawful State and Local DNA Indexing \nFrameworks \n \n28.  Through the maintenance and use of the Suspect Index, the Defendants have created \nan unauthorized expansion of the national DNA database system. Since 1994, federal and state \ngovernments have established and maintained a national system to facilitate DNA comparisons, \nknown collectively as the Combined DNA Index System (CODIS), that was created by and is \nregulated through federal and state law. Law enforcement rely on this DNA indexing system to \ncompare DNA from crime scene evidence against uploaded DNA profiles of individuals: if the \nDNA markers are the same, a โmatchโ is reported to law enforcement. \n29.  CODIS is an umbrella system of DNA indices: the National DNA Index System \n(NDIS), the State DNA Index Systems (SDIS), and the Local DNA Index Systems (LDIS). Each \nindex system categorizes DNA samples into smaller, discrete indices. Only two categories are \nrelevant here: โKnownโ indices, which store DNA profiles of known persons, and โForensic \nUnknownโ indices, which store DNA profiles collected from crime scene evidence.  \n30.  Within CODIS are DNA databases from all 50 states (known as SDIS databases), \nincluding New York Stateโs DNA index system. New Yorkโs SDIS is jointly maintained by the \nNew York State Division of Criminal Justice Services and the New York State Police. Each stateโs \nlegislature determines whether their stateโs SDIS includes arrestees. In New York, the state \nlegislature restricted the eligibility criteria for its โKnownโ index to people convicted of certain \ncrimes. DNA profiles are thus only uploaded to New Yorkโs SDIS if they meet this eligibility \ncriteria.  \n31.  Most local laboratories that participate in CODIS maintain their own LDIS, which \nis an independent local DNA database. Each such laboratory, including OCME, is authorized to \nmaintain its own LDIS to perform a limited function: to store crime scene DNA profiles for upload \n  9 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-02305   Document 1   Filed 03/21/22   Page 10 of 24\n \nto higher SDIS Unknown indices, where they are compared to the profiles stored in the Known \nindices in SDIS. OCME maintains an LDIS and uses it for this authorized purpose. But, within its \nLDIS, OCME also maintains another, unauthorized โKnownโ index, referred to here as the Suspect \nIndex. That unauthorized index contains profiles from arrestees and mere suspects, including \nchildren as young as 11 years old, that are barred by state law from being included in New Yorkโs \nSDIS, and it continuously compares these unauthorized profiles to all past and future crime scene \nDNA evidence. \nNYCโs LDIS Index\nLocal DNA \nIndex\nUNAUTHORIZED\nForensic  Known Suspect \nUnknown Index Index\nโข Unidentified  โข Convicted persons\nforensic profiles  โข Arrestees\n(crimescene โข Suspects\nevidence) โข Persons of interest\nโข Children\n \nUnlike the โKnownโ Indices within NDIS and SDIS, the Cityโs Suspect Index is Illegal and \nUnregulated \n32.   OCME operates the Cityโs Suspect Index in violation of the New York State \nLegislatureโs comprehensive DNA laws and its regulatory structure. Through Article 49-B of the \nExecutive Law, the New York State Legislature created SDIS and the laws governing state and \nlocal forensic DNA laboratories. Under Article 49-B, local laboratories such as OCME are barred \nfrom maintaining a local โKnownโ index separate from SDIS. Nonetheless, OCME developed and \n  10 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-02305   Document 1   Filed 03/21/22   Page 11 of 24\n \ncontinues to maintain its own โKnownโ index, the Suspect Index. OCME not only maintains a \nโKnownโ index in violation of Article 49-B, it includes DNA profiles in the index that Article 49-\nB explicitly disallows.  \n33.  The  New York State  Legislature  made  a deliberate decision  to limit  SDISโs \nโKnownโ DNA profiles to people convicted of crimes and has steadfastly refused to expand this \nindex in order to carefully balance the needs of law enforcement against the privacy of minors and \nof adults accused but not convicted of crimes. Despite this, the NYPD collects, and OCME \nanalyzes and permanently indexes, DNA samples from children, suspects, and arrestees, including \nthose whose charges are dismissed, circumventing New York Stateโs clear legal mandate.  \n34.  This practice is particularly egregious as it relates to children. Juvenile delinquency \nproceedings are, by design, intended to relieve children from the stigma or burden of a criminal \nrecord, and juvenile delinquency proceedings as a matter of law can never result in criminal \nconvictions. Rather, if a court finds that a child engaged in conduct that would constitute a crime \nif  conducted  by  an  adult,  the  result  is  a  juvenile  delinquency  adjudication,  not  a  criminal \nconviction. The law affords children significant safeguards to protect their privacy throughout \njuvenile delinquency proceedings even when an adjudication is made. These protections include \nthat police records of a childโs arrest must be withheld from public inspection; that all fingerprints \nand photos of a child alleged to be a juvenile delinquent be destroyed if there is a favorable \ndisposition or the person reaches the age of 21 without a criminal conviction or open case; that, \nexcept where required by statute, no one may require a person to divulge information relating to a \njuvenile delinquency arrest or proceeding; and that adjudications may not prevent the person from \nengaging in any profession or lawful activity. \n  11 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-02305   Document 1   Filed 03/21/22   Page 12 of 24\n \n35.  The Cityโs policy contains no safeguards to prevent the indefinite retention of a \nchildโs DNA profile. The Cityโs policy contains no time limitation for the use of a childโs DNA, \neven if they are never convicted of a criminal offense. Instead, the Cityโs practice of subjecting \nchildren to perpetual genetic lineups treats them like permanent suspects in crimes.  \n36.  The  Cityโs  Suspect  Index  is  not  only  illegal,  but  it  is  unregulated  by  any \nindependent  body.  NDIS  and  SDIS  operate  under  strict  federal  regulations  and  under  FBI \noversight. But the Suspect Index is not subject to such oversight. New Yorkโs SDIS not only \noperates under federal regulation and FBI oversight, it also operates under state regulations and \nthe  independent  oversight  of  the  New  York  State  Commission  on  Forensic  Science.  The \nCommission was established under Article 49-B to develop minimum standards for all forensic \nlaboratories in New York. But the Commission has no authority over OCMEโs creation and \noperation of the Suspect Index. Thus, unlike New Yorkโs SDIS, the Suspect Index, operates \nwithout any independent oversight.  \n \nThe Cityโs Practice of Using the Private Genetic Material of Unsuspecting New Yorkers to \nTurn Them into Permanent Suspects Invades their Privacy  \n37.  The Cityโs practice of hoarding the DNA of unsuspecting New Yorkers in an \nunauthorized and unregulated Suspect Index exploits the fact that people unavoidably shed their \nDNA wherever they go through skin cells, hair, and saliva. By merely touching an objectโs surface \nwith their fingertip, a person causes their DNA to be deposited on it. Every used coffee cup, tissue, \nstraw, cigarette butt, soda can, and piece of gum leaves behind thousands of copies of a personโs \ngenetic material. People unavoidably shed their DNA even when they arenโt touching objects or \nconsuming things. Each hour, a person sheds approximately 30,000 to 40,000 skin cells. And each \nday, a person sheds 40 to 100 hairs.  \n  12 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-02305   Document 1   Filed 03/21/22   Page 13 of 24\n \n38.  Scientific developments have even made it possible to vacuum DNA samples from \nthe open air, according to a recent scientific journal article. While this new technique is currently \nbeing used to identify nearby zoo animals based on their airborne DNA samples, it reveals the \ngreat extent to which DNA is unavoidably shed in the environment.  \n39.  While people unwittingly shed DNA, the information contained within it remains \ncritically important and private to them. Unlike a fingerprint, DNA reveals  deeply personal \ncharacteristics like a personโs genetic predispositions toward certain medical conditions, including \nAlzheimerโs, cystic fibrosis, breast cancer, and addiction; their ancestry; and their biological \nfamilial relationships, including previously unknown parentage. \n40.  Traditional forensic DNA testing analyzes so-called โnon-codingโ regions of our \nDNA to determine someoneโs identity. While it had typically been understood that only the \nโcodingโ DNA regions reveal personal characteristics, in recent years researchers have found that \nโnon-codingโ DNA regions can reveal more than someoneโs identity. For example, researchers \nhave found dozens of associations between โnon-codingโ DNA and genetic traits ranging from \nschizophrenia to cancer.  \n41.  While CODIS laboratories across the country are limited under federal regulation \nto โnon-codingโ analysis, the City has rolled out its plans to use โcodingโ DNA to map out a \npersonโs family tree. A new NYPD investigative practice, called Investigative Genetic Genealogy \n(IGG), relies on the โcodingโ regions of DNA to generate investigative leads in cases.  \n42.  IGG begins with a DNA sample from an unsolved crime. In order to generate an \ninvestigate lead using IGG, the police must first send the crime scene DNA sample to a private \nlaboratory to analyze the DNAโs โcodingโ regions. The next step is to search for genetic relatives \nof the DNA found at the crime scene โ in other words, to try to locate family members of the \n  13 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-02305   Document 1   Filed 03/21/22   Page 14 of 24\n \nputative perpetrator โ using commercial databases, like FamilyTreeDNA and GEDmatch, to which \nmillions of people have uploaded their DNA profiles. If a  potential family member of the \nperpetrator is identified through a commercial database search, then the third step in the IGG \nprocess begins: building out a family tree.  \n43.  To find out who within a family is a match to the crime scene DNA sample, NYPD \ninvestigators  build  out  a  family  tree  starting  with  the  family  member  identified  through  a \ncommercial database. Unless several members of that personโs family have uploaded their DNA \nin commercial genealogical databases, NYPD investigators need to collect DNA from the other \nrelatives in the family tree, including family members that are not suspected of involvement in the \nunderlying crime, to determine ancestral lines and familial relationships and narrow their search. \n44.  In December 2021, Deputy Chief Katranakis refused to answer questions about \nwhether the NYPD would seek a warrant or a personโs consent before collecting DNA samples in \nits IGG investigations, rather than relying on the surreptitious collection procedures outlined in the \nDetective Guide. Through the Cityโs collection and retention of thousands of DNA samples from \nsuspects and arrestees, much of the DNA collection work necessary to build out family trees for \nIGG has already begun. OCME retains a vial of DNA extract, which contains both โcodingโ and \nโnon-codingโ regions, in cold storage for each suspect or arrestee for whom the NYPD has already \nrequested OCME perform forensic DNA testing. Using IGG, NYPD investigators can use a \npersonโs DNA sample, secretly taken in an unrelated case, to investigate that personโs entire family \nin search of a relative that is a match to the crime scene sample. \n45.  In essence, this new technology creates an incentive for the NYPD to surreptitiously \ncollect and store as much โsuspect DNAโ as possible, because the DNA of a suspect may turn out \nto be genetically related to DNA collected at a crime scene and investigated using IGG. In March \n  14 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-02305   Document 1   Filed 03/21/22   Page 15 of 24\n \n2021, Deputy Chief Katranakis informed state officials that, in the NYPDโs view, state regulations \naddressing the use of investigative genetic genealogy do not apply to the NYPD. The Cityโs use \nof this investigative method has since been shrouded in complete secrecy and free from any \nsafeguards.  \n46.  IGG investigations implicate the genetic privacy of a suspectโs parents, siblings, \nchildren, and other extended relatives without any independent checks or standards. Genealogical \nresearchers warn that systems like IGG can use one DNA profile to ascertain genetic information \nabout relatives as distant as third cousins or a second cousin once removed. Given the amount of \ninformation available in โcodingโ DNA, IGG investigations have been described as the equivalent \nof the government going through all of your medical and familial records.  \n47.  Because of the racially disproportionate rates of arrests in New York City, the \nCityโs practice of collecting the DNA of arrestees and storing the samples in the Suspect Index \nmakes mostly Black and Latinx people permanent suspects in all crimes involving DNA evidence. \nOf all NYPD arrests from 2006โ2020, 48.5% of arrests were of Black individuals and 26% were \nof Latinx individuals. Of the total arrests during this period, 12% of arrests were of white, non-\nLatinx individuals.    \n48.  Beyond the harm of being treated as permanent suspects, Black and Latinx people \nwhose DNA are in the Suspect Index face the risk of wrongful arrest from DNA contamination. \nBecause DNA transfers  easily to  and from persons and surfaces,  contamination  presents a \npersistent problem to determining what DNA is relevant in crime scene evidence. Terrell Gills, for \nexample, was a regular customer at the local Dunkin Donuts in his Queens neighborhood and, \nunbeknownst to him, left his DNA behind there. When the store was robbed, a swab of a \ntouchscreen cash register matched to Gillsโ profile in SDIS. Although two other similar robberies \n  15 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-02305   Document 1   Filed 03/21/22   Page 16 of 24\n \nhad taken place within a few days of each other at nearby Dunkin Donuts stores and had resulted \nin the arrest of another man, Mr. Gills was wrongfully arrested and jailed pretrial for a year and a \nhalf, and prosecuted based solely on the DNA match. He was acquitted at trial.  \n49.  The risk of DNA contamination is made worse in New York City because rank-\nand-file NYPD officers who come into contact with crime scene evidence have refused to place \ntheir DNA in an โelimination databaseโ to confirm when contamination takes place. The National \nInstitute of Standards and Technology, a federal agency, recommends that all law enforcement \npersonnel place their DNA in an elimination database to ensure accurate DNA comparisons. But \nunions representing NYPD officers have steadfastly refused to comply with this recommendation, \nciting their privacy concerns over storing officer DNA in a database.  \n \nDespite the NYPDโs Promises of Reform, the Cityโs Suspect Index Has Continued to Grow \n50.  In February 2020, under pressure from the City Council, the NYPD announced \nreforms to its DNA retention policies, with the central change being that the NYPD promised to \nreview the DNA profiles in the Suspect Index and notify OCME if it authorized, pursuant to its \nown criteria, that profiles can be removed. The NYPD announced that it would conduct an initial \nreview of all suspect profiles that are at least two years old. After that review, every four years the \nNYPD will review the suspect profiles that are at least four years old. And for any new profiles \nadded to the Suspect Index, the NYPD will review those profiles upon reaching their second year \nof existence in the index.   \n51.  Under the NYPDโs unilaterally developed review criteria, the NYPD will not \nrecommend that an individualโs profile be removed if the profile is eligible for inclusion in SDIS \nbecause of a criminal conviction, if the individual is a suspect in an ongoing police investigation \n  16 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-02305   Document 1   Filed 03/21/22   Page 17 of 24\n \nor prosecution, or if โno judicial conclusion was reached on the personโs innocence.โ The NYPD \nretains sole discretion to determine when these criteria for retaining someoneโs DNA are met.  \n52.  The NYPD also announced that individuals who were acquitted in the case for \nwhich their DNA was taken can submit a certificate of disposition to OCME to seek the removal \nof their DNA profile from the Suspect Index. However, they announced no plans to notify \nindividuals whose DNA was taken surreptitiously that their DNA was placed in the Suspect Index. \nThe NYPD and the local District Attorneyโs office both have unregulated discretion to approve or \nveto removal requests.  \n53.  On May 3, 2021, the NYPD completed its initial audit of suspect profiles that are \nat least two years old. According to the NYPD, out of nearly 30,000 suspect profiles, the NYPD \nreviewed 20,460 profiles. Of the 20,460 profiles reviewed, the NYPD marked 5,400 profiles for \nremoval and retained 15,060 profiles in the index, resulting in over 73% of the reviewed profiles \nremaining in the Suspect Index. Of those profiles remaining in the Index, 1,106 profiles are for \nindividuals who cannot be stored in any index under state law because they have never been \nconvicted of a crime.  \n54.  The Cityโs Suspect Index has continued to grow, despite the NYPDโs promised \nreforms. From June 2, 2021, the date of the first OCME report following the audit, to March 1, \n2022, the date of OCMEโs most recent report, the Suspect Index has grown from 28,660 to 31,826 \nprofiles, an increase of 3,166 individuals or almost a dozen New Yorkers per day. These samples \nhave been searched without suspicion by comparing them against approximately 29,492 DNA \nsamples from crime scenes and will continue to be searched against any future evidence. \n \n \n \n  17 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-02305   Document 1   Filed 03/21/22   Page 18 of 24\n \nPlaintiffsโ DNA Were Taken by the NYPD and Placed in the Cityโs Suspect Index to be \nPerpetually Searched  \nShakira Leslie \n55.  On July 3, 2019, Plaintiff Shakira Leslie was sitting in the back seat of a friendโs \ncar and leaving a cousinโs birthday party. The NYPD pulled the car over for a purported traffic \ninfraction and ordered Ms. Leslie, along with the driver and three other passengers, out of the car \nto be searched. According to the police, the front seat passenger possessed a firearm in a fanny \npack.   \n56.  Ms. Leslie was searched and the NYPD found no contraband on her. And yet, the \npolice arrested her, and brought her to the precinct for questioning. Ms. Leslie was charged with \npossessing the weapon the NYPD found in the possession of the front seat passenger.  \n57.  At the precinct, the NYPD deprived Ms. Leslie of food and water for over 12 hours \nbefore they finally brought her into an interrogation room. She was so thirsty that, when police \nofficers offered her a cup of water, she immediately took it and drank.   \n58.  Unbeknownst to Ms. Leslie, the cup of water was a ruse by the NYPD to obtain her \nDNA. The NYPD collected the cup and took her DNA without her knowledge, pursuant to their \npolicy and practice. Ms. Leslie never offered, and was never asked for, her consent to have her \nDNA taken. And the NYPD did not obtain a warrant or court order before secretly taking her DNA \nand sending the sample to OCME to perform DNA testing. \n59.  After  performing  an  analysis  of  the  DNA,  generating  a  suspect  profile,  and \ncomparing it to DNA found on evidence recovered in the case, OCME determined that her profile \ndid not match any DNA evidence in the case.  \n60.  Ms. Leslie was never indicted for any crime in the case and ultimately all charges \nagainst her were dismissed. Despite her innocence, pursuant to its policy and practice, OCME still \n  18 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-02305   Document 1   Filed 03/21/22   Page 19 of 24\n \nplaced Ms. Leslieโs DNA profile into the Suspect Index, where it is compared without suspicion \nagainst all past and new crime scene evidence involving DNA.  \n61.  At the time her DNA was taken in 2019 and through the present day, Ms. Leslie \nhas not been convicted of a crime. Ms. Leslie now works as a hair stylist and makeup artist, while \nalso caring for her newborn son.  \n62.  On January 26, 2022, OCME confirmed that Ms. Leslieโs DNA profile remains in \nits Suspect Index. Ms. Leslie is troubled by the City treating her as a permanent suspect in all \ncrimes. \nShamill Burgos \n63.  On September 7, 2019, Plaintiff Shamill Burgos was sitting in the front passenger \nseat of a friendโs car that was parked in the lot of an apartment complex. Mr. Burgosโ friend had \njust bought the car and Mr. Burgos was checking it out. An unmarked NYPD car then drove up, \ntwo officers came out with their hands on their weapons, and they ordered everyone to get out of \nthe car. NYPD officers then searched the car and reportedly found a gun inside of a fanny pack in \nthe trunk of the car.  \n64.  The police arrested Mr. Burgos and brought him to a precinct for questioning. At \nthe precinct, he was placed in a room and handcuffed to a pole for hours. He was later transferred \nto a different precinct where he was eventually brought to an interrogation room, where officers \nhanded him a cup of water and a cigarette. He smoked the cigarette and drank the water.  \n65.  After escorting Mr. Burgos out of the interrogation room, NYPD officers returned \nto the interrogation room, collected his used cigarette and took his DNA without his knowledge, \npursuant to their policy and practice. Mr. Burgos never offered, and was never asked, to consent \n  19 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-02305   Document 1   Filed 03/21/22   Page 20 of 24\n \nto have his DNA taken. And the NYPD did not obtain a warrant or court order before secretly \ntaking his DNA and sending the sample to OCME to perform DNA testing.  \n66.  Mr. Burgos was later brought to court where he was arraigned and immediately \nreleased. He was never indicted in the case and his charges were dismissed. Despite that, pursuant \nto its policy and practice, OCME analyzed Mr. Burgosโ DNA, generated a suspect profile, and \nplaced his DNA profile into the Suspect Index, where it is compared without suspicion against all \npast and new crime scene evidence involving DNA. \n67.  At the time his DNA was taken in 2019 and through the present day, Mr. Burgos \nhas not been convicted of a crime. Mr. Burgos is now enrolled in the infantry division of the U.S. \nmilitary, where for the last two years he has served his country both domestically and abroad. He \nis currently stationed in Louisiana. \n68.  On January 10, 2022, OCME confirmed that Mr. Burgosโ DNA profile remains in \ntheir Suspect Index. Mr. Burgos is worried and scared by the City treating him as a permanent \nsuspect in all crimes, especially when he no longer lives in New York.   \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n69.  The named Plaintiffs bring this action on their own behalf and, pursuant to Rule \n23(a) and (b)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, on behalf of all people who have had or \nwill have their DNA surreptitiously taken and analyzed by the Defendants without consent and \nwithout a warrant or court order and maintained in the Cityโs Suspect Index. All four requirements \nof Rule 23(a) are satisfied: \na.  Numerosity: Joinder of all class members is impracticable because of the \nsize and fluid nature of the class. Thousands of DNA samples maintained in the \n  20 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-02305   Document 1   Filed 03/21/22   Page 21 of 24\n \nSuspect Index were surreptitiously taken and analyzed by the Defendants and are \nperpetually compared against crime scene evidence. \nb.  Commonality: There are questions of law and fact common to all members \nof the class, including, but not limited to: whether the Defendants have the policy \nand practice of surreptitiously taking and analyzing unsuspecting peopleโs DNA \nand maintaining it in the Suspect Index, and whether that policy and practice results \nin the violation of the class membersโ Fourth Amendment and statutory rights. \nc.  Typicality: The claims of the named Plaintiffs are typical of those of the \nclass. The named Plaintiffs, like all class members, have been subjected to the \nDefendantsโ policies, actions or inaction, have been injured by this, and require \nsimilar relief. \nd.  Adequacy of Representation: The named Plaintiffs and class counsel will \nfairly and adequately represent the interests of the class. The named Plaintiffs have \nsuffered injury and are committed to obtaining declaratory and injunctive relief that \nwill benefit the entire class by ending Defendantsโ surreptitious and perpetual \ncomparison of their DNA against crime scene evidence. Their interests are not \nantagonistic to those of other class members. Class counsel have many years of \ncombined experience in complex civil litigation, civil rights, and class action \nlitigation. \n70.  Class-wide declaratory and injunctive relief are appropriate under Rule 23(b)(2) \nbecause the Defendants have acted or refused to act on grounds applicable to the class as a whole. \n \n \n  21 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-02305   Document 1   Filed 03/21/22   Page 22 of 24\n \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n71.  This case arises under the Constitution and laws of the United States, including 42 \nU.S.C.  ยง  1983.  This  Court  has  subject-matter  jurisdiction  pursuant  to  28  U.S.C.  ยงยง  1331, \n1343(a)(3)-(4), as this action seeks redress for the violation of the Plaintiffsโ constitutional rights \nunder color of state law. This Court also has supplemental jurisdiction over this actionโs state law \nclaim pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 1367(a).  \n72.  Plaintiffsโ claims for declaratory and injunctive relief are authorized by 28 U.S.C. \nยงยง 2201(a) and 2202 and Rules 57 and 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. \n73.  Venue is proper in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New \nYork pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 1391(b) because a substantial part of the events or omissions giving \nrise to the claims occurred in this District. \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nFirst Cause of Action  \n \nViolation of the Fourth Amendment  \nRight to Be Secure Against Unreasonable Searches and Seizures \n \n74.  Defendantsโ actions or inactions alleged herein have violated and continue to \nviolate the rights of the named Plaintiffs and the putative class under the Fourth Amendment of \nthe United States Constitution. \nSecond Cause of Action \nViolation of Article 49-B of the Executive Law \n75.  Defendantsโ actions or inactions alleged herein have violated and continue to \nviolate the rights of the named Plaintiffs and the putative class under Article 49-B of the Executive \nLaw. \n  22 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-02305   Document 1   Filed 03/21/22   Page 23 of 24\n \nRELIEF REQUESTED  \nWHEREFORE, the Plaintiffs respectfully request that the Court: \na.  Assume jurisdiction over this matter;  \n \nb.  Certify this action as a class action pursuant to Rule 23(b)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure; \n \nc.  Declare that the Cityโs practice of secretly taking, analyzing and maintaining peoplesโ \nDNA in its Suspect Index for comparison against crime scene evidence constitutes an \nunreasonable search in violation of the Fourth Amendment absent a warrant or court order \npermitting the search; \n \nd.  Declare that the Cityโs maintenance of a Suspect Index violates Article 49-B of the \nExecutive Law;  \n \ne.  Permanently enjoin the Defendants from subjecting the Plaintiffs and the putative class to \nthe unconstitutional and unlawful practices described here; \n \nf.  Order the Defendants to expunge all suspect profiles in the Cityโs Suspect Index that were \ncreated and maintained as a result of the unconstitutional and unlawful practices described \nhere; \n \ng.  Award the Plaintiffs reasonable attorneysโ fees and costs under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1988; and  \n \nh.  Grant any other relief the Court deems just and proper.  \n \nDated: March 21, 2022  Respectfully submitted, \n  New York, N.Y.   \n  s/ Philip Desgranges \n   \nPhilip Desgranges  \nJ.
