    "summary": "<p>On November 7, 2016, the State of North Dakota, joined by the Religious Sisters of Mercy, two Sacred Heart Mercy Health Care Center clinics, the SMP Health System, and the University of Mary, filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) challenging a federal regulation that they argued compelled healthcare professionals to cast aside their medical judgment and religious beliefs and perform medical transition procedures on patients who desire to have a sex change. Plaintiffs, who brought suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of North Dakota Eastern Division, specifically claimed that it was a violation of the Administrative Procedure Act and other federal laws for HHS to redefine the term &ldquo;sex&rdquo; in Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act from meaning &ldquo;a person&rsquo;s biological sex at birth&rdquo; to meaning &ldquo;an individual&rsquo;s internal sense of gender.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>This case was later consolidated with another case having similar aspects of law and fact on January 23, 2017, adding several more Catholic associations as plaintiffs, including the Catholic Benefits Association (CBA), as well as adding the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) as a defendant. Plaintiffs sought (1) a declarative judgment stating the regulation is invalid under the Administrative Procedure Act, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, the Spending Clause, and the First, Fifth, Tenth, Eleventh, and Fourteenth Amendments, (2) a permanent injunction preventing the enforcement of the regulation, and (3) attorneys costs and fees. This case was assigned to Magistrate Judge Alice R. Senechal and District Judge Ralph R. Erickson, and then later reassigned to Chief Judge Daniel L. Hovland, and then Chief Judge Peter D. Welte.</p>\r\n<p>Plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction on November 17, 2016. On December 31, 2016, a federal district court in Texas issued a nationwide preliminary injunction against the same HHS regulations the Plaintiffs challenged here, preventing its enforcement. <em>See <a href=\"../../../../case/15571/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Franciscan Alliance, Inc. v. Burwell</a>.&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n<p>On May 26, 2017, Defendants filed a voluntary motion to stay and a motion to remand so that HHS could take another look at the regulation in light of Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act to consider the regulation&rsquo;s reasonableness, necessity, and efficacy. As a response, Plaintiffs also filed a motion for an additional stay of enforcement by the EEOC. On August 24, 2017, Judge Hovland granted the defendants&rsquo; motion to stay and denied the motion to remand as moot, seeing as HHS had the inherent authority to reconsider the rule regardless of a remand. At this point, the nationwide preliminary injunction remained in effect and litigation was stayed to allow HHS to reconsider the controversial rules and regulations at issue.</p>\r\n<p>After the <em>Franciscan Alliance</em> court granted summary judgment for the plaintiffs and ordered the regulation to be vacated &ldquo;insofar as [it] defines &lsquo;[o]n the basis of sex&rsquo; to include gender identity and termination of pregnancy&rdquo; in October 2019, HHS issued a new Section 1557 rule on June 12, 2020. This rule defined &ldquo;sex&rdquo; by referencing Title IX, and did not include a &ldquo;religious exemption, whether narrow or broad.&rdquo; In response to these developments, Plaintiffs here filed an unopposed motion to lift the stay in order to amend their complaint and proceed with litigation, which was granted on November 9, 2020.<br />In their amended complaint filed on November 23, 2020, the plaintiffs contested the new HHS rule based on the idea that Title IX does not apply to covered entities &ldquo;controlled by a religious organization if the application of this subsection would not be consistent with the religious tenets of such organization,&rdquo; and the limited definition of &ldquo;sex&rdquo; at the time Title IX was enacted. Plaintiffs then filed a motion for declaratory judgment and a motion for partial summary judgment or, in the alternative, a preliminary injunction on November 23, 2020. The defendants also filed a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction on December 23, 2020.</p>\r\n<p>On January 19, 2021, Chief Judge Welte granted in part and denied in part the motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction. The court claimed jurisdiction over the Plaintiffs&rsquo; RFRA and Spending Clause claims challenging the interpretations of Section 1557 and Title VII that compel them to perform and provide insurance coverage for gender transitions, but called for the dismissal of the abortion-related claims, the APA claims, and the claims challenging Title IX and other unidentified federal laws. The Plaintiffs&rsquo; motions for partial summary judgment and injunctive relief were granted as to the RFRA claims that challenged the interpretations of Section 1557 and Title VII requiring the Plaintiffs to perform and provide insurance coverage for gender-transition procedures, but denied in all other respects. Chief Judge Welte also declared that HHS&rsquo;s interpretation of Section 1557 and EEOC&rsquo;s interpretation of Title VII violated Plaintiff's sincerely held religious beliefs without satisfying strict scrutiny under the RFRA. As such, Chief Judge Welte permanently enjoined HHS and EEOC from implementing any regulations and interpreting Section 1557 of the ACA and Title VII in a way that would require the Catholic Plaintiffs to perform or provide insurance coverage for gender-transition procedures, including by denying federal financial assistance because of their failure to perform or provide insurance coverage for such procedures, or by otherwise pursuing, charging, or assessing any penalties, fines, assessments, investigations, or other enforcement actions. 513 F.Supp.3d 1113.</p>\r\n<p>The defendants then appealed the decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit on April 20, 2021. (21-1890). On December 9, 2022, the Eighth Circuit affirmed the district court's grant of permanent injunctive relief to the plaintiffs except to the extent it recognized the associational standing of the CBA. The Eighth Circuit held that CBA failed to identify association members who suffered the requisite harm, meaning that CBA lacked associational standing to sue on behalf of unnamed members. The case was remanded to the district court for further proceedings consistent with the appellate opinion. 55 F.4th 583.</p>\r\n<p>This case is still ongoing.</p>",

For the reasons below, the Court concludes that the RFRA \nentitles the Catholic Plaintiffs to permanent injunctive relief from the provision or coverage of \ngender-transition procedures.  The other claims either run afoul of jurisdictional limitations or do \nnot warrant summary judgment.   \nI.  BACKGROUND \n  The Court begins with the statutory framework of Section 1557.  Next is an overview of \nthe implementing regulations and resulting litigation.  An introduction of the parties follows.  Last \nis a summary of these cases’ recent procedural developments. \n  A.  Statutory Framework \n  Enacted in March 2010, the ACA is “a comprehensive national plan to provide universal \nhealth insurance coverage.”  Nat’l Fed’n of Indep. Bus. v. Sebelius, 567 U.S. 519, 583 (2012).  \nFundamentally, the ACA is designed to broaden access to healthcare and insurance coverage.  \nKing v. Burwell, 576 U.S. 473, 478-79 (2015).  Part and parcel with that objective is the ACA’s \nban on discrimination in healthcare. \nCodified at 42 U.S.C. § 18116, Section 1557 of the ACA prohibits any federally funded or \nadministered health program or activity from engaging in discrimination.  Rather than specifically \nlisting the prohibited grounds for discrimination, Section 1557 coopts four preexisting civil rights \nstatutes: (1) Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. § 2000d et seq.) (race, color, or \nnational origin); (2) Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (20 U.S.C. § 1681 et seq.) \n(sex); (3) the Age Discrimination Act of 1975 (42 U.S.C. § 6101 et seq.) (age); and (4) the \nRehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. § 794) (disability).  In kind, Section 1557 adopts the \nenforcement mechanisms available under each incorporated statute.  42 U.S.C. § 18116(a).  The \n2 \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 124   Filed 01/19/21   Page 3 of 57\nSecretary of HHS holds discretionary authority to promulgate implementing regulations.  Id. § \n18116(c).    \nThe lone prohibited ground relevant for these cases stems from Title IX, which forbids \ndiscrimination “on the basis of sex.”  20 U.S.C. § 1681(a).  Two exceptions merit mention up front.  \nFirst, Title IX is inapplicable “to an educational institution which is controlled by a religious \norganization”  if  application  “would  not  be  consistent  with  the  religious  tenets  of  such \norganization.”  Id. § 1681(a)(3); see also 20 U.S.C. § 1687.  Second, Title IX cannot “require or \nprohibit any person, or public or private entity, to provide or pay for any benefit or service, \nincluding the use of facilities, related to an abortion.”  20 U.S.C. § 1688.   \nFor enforcement, Section 1557 (by way of Title IX) greenlights administrative agencies to \nrevoke federal funding for an offending health program or activity.  20 U.S.C. § 1682.  Agencies \nmay also pursue “any other means authorized by law,” including civil enforcement proceedings, \ndebarment from doing business with the federal government, lawsuits under the False Claims Act, \nand even criminal penalties.1  See id.  In addition, Section 1557 supports a private right of action \nfor  damages  and  attorney’s  fees.    See  Rumble  v.  Fairview  Health  Servs.,  No.  14-cv-2037 \n(SRN/FLN), 2015 WL 1197415, at *7 n.3 (D. Minn. Mar. 16, 2015) (concluding that Section 1557 \nprovides a private right of action because each incorporated statute does so). \n \n \n1 Applicants for federal financial assistance from HHS must complete Form 690, which certifies \nthat the applicant will comply with antidiscrimination laws like Section 1557 and Title IX.  See 45 \nC.F.R. §§ 86.4, 92.4.  Subsequent failure to comply with those laws may trigger the False Claims \nAct, exposing an offender to civil penalties of up to $11,000 per false claim “plus 3 times the \namount of damages which the Government sustains because of” any false claim.  31 U.S.C. § \n3729(a)(1).  Further, an individual who makes a materially false statement in connection with the \ndelivery of or payment for healthcare benefits or services is subject to criminal monetary penalties, \nup to five years’ imprisonment, or both.  18 U.S.C. § 1035. \n3 \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 124   Filed 01/19/21   Page 4 of 57\nB.  Regulations and Litigation \n1.  The 2016 Rule \nMore than six years after the ACA became law, HHS promulgated a rule interpreting \nSection 1557.  See Nondiscrimination in Health Programs and Activities, 81 Fed. Reg. 31,376 \n(May 18, 2016) (“2016 Rule”).  The 2016 Rule applied broadly.  HHS defined “covered entity” to \nencompass any “entity that operates a health program or activity, any part of which receives \nFederal financial assistance.”  Id. at 31,466 (formerly codified at 45 C.F.R. § 92.4).  And a “health \nprogram or activity” meant “the provision of health-related services, health-related insurance \ncoverage, or other health-related coverage.”  Id. at 31,467.  For entities “principally engaged” in \nthose endeavors, the regulation extended to “all of [their] operations.”  Id.  Due to near-ubiquitous \nparticipation in Medicaid and Medicare, HHS estimated that the 2016 Rule would apply to “almost \nall practicing physicians in the United States” and to over 133,000 hospitals, clinics, and other \nhealthcare facilities.  Id. at 31,445-46.  The agency also predicted that the regulation would apply \nto  the  approximately  180  insurers  that  offered  health  plans  through  ACA  or  state-based \nmarketplaces.  Id. at 31,445. \nMaking the incorporation of Title IX plain, the 2016 Rule prohibited discrimination “on \nthe basis of . . . sex.”  Id. at 31,469 (formerly codified at 45 C.F.R. § 92.101(a)).  HHS then defined \nthat phrase to include “discrimination on the basis of . . . termination of pregnancy, . . . sex \nstereotyping, and gender identity.”  Id. at 31,467 (formerly codified at 45 C.F.R. § 92.4).  Drilling \ndown further, the 2016 Rule defined “gender identity” as “an individual’s internal sense of gender, \nwhich may be male, female, neither, or a combination of male and female, and which may be \ndifferent from an individual’s sex assigned at birth.”  Id.  And “sex stereotypes” in part meant “the \nexpectation that individuals will consistently identify with only one gender and that they will act \n4 \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 124   Filed 01/19/21   Page 5 of 57\nin conformity with the gender-related expressions stereotypically associated with that gender.”  Id. \nat 31,468.  The regulation left “termination of pregnancy” undefined. \nHHS contextualized those definitions with specific examples of discriminatory conduct.  \nTo start, the 2016 Rule prohibited a covered healthcare provider from refusing to offer medical \nservices for gender transitions2 if that provider offered comparable services to others.  Id. at 31,471 \n(formerly codified at 45 C.F.R. § 92.206).  HHS used this example: “A provider specializing in \ngynecological services that previously declined to provide a medically necessary hysterectomy for \na transgender man would have to revise its policy to provide the procedure for transgender \nindividuals in the same manner it provides the procedure for other individuals.”  Id. at 31,455.  The \nsame concept theoretically applied for abortions.  So if an obstetrician performed dilation and \ncurettage procedures for miscarriages, then the 2016 Rule barred a later refusal to perform those \nprocedures for abortions.  See Doc. No. 95, ¶ 134.  As for covered entities’ health plans, HHS \ndeclared that any “categorical . . . exclusion or limitation on coverage for all health services related \nto gender transition is unlawful on its face.”  81 Fed. Reg. at 31,429; see also id. at 31,471-72 \n(formerly codified at 45 C.F.R. § 92.207(b)(4)-(5)).  Put differently, the 2016 Rule prohibited \ncovered insurers and third-party administrators3 (“TPAs”) from offering or administering health \nplans with gender-transition exclusions.  Doc. No. 97, ¶ 133.  The regulation likewise banned \nhealthcare providers from issuing such exclusions in their employee health plans.  Id. ¶ 135. \n \n2 HHS noted that “[t]he range of transition-related services, which includes treatment for gender \ndysphoria, is not limited to surgical treatments and may include . . . hormone therapy and \npsychotherapy, which may occur over the lifetime of the individual.”  81 Fed. Reg. at 31,435-36. \n3 Self-insured entities often contract with TPAs to administer their group health plans.  TPAs “are \ngenerally not responsible for the benefit design of the self-insured plans they administer.”  81 Fed. \nReg. at 31,432. \n5 \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 124   Filed 01/19/21   Page 6 of 57\nMeanwhile, the 2016 Rule imported applicable statutory exceptions for discrimination \nbased on race, color, national origin, age, and disability.  81 Fed. Reg. at 31,470 (formerly codified \nat 45 C.F.R. § 92.101(c)).  For sex discrimination, though, HHS conspicuously omitted Title IX’s \nreligious and abortion-neutrality exemptions.  See id.  The agency deflected comments calling for \nthe religious carve-out’s inclusion by positing that “Section 1557 contains no religious exemption” \nand that “a blanket religious exemption could result in a denial or delay in the provision of health \ncare and in discouraging individuals from seeking necessary care.”  Id. at 31,380.   \nHHS  rejected  the  abortion-neutrality  exemption  too,  explaining  that  separate  ACA \nprovisions could shield objecting providers and insurers.  Id.  In particular, HHS cited to Section \n1303 of the ACA.  That statute provides that a qualified health plan is not required to include \nabortion coverage as an essential health benefit.  42 U.S.C. § 18023(b)(1)(A)(i).  Section 1303 \nadditionally bars qualified health plans offered through an ACA exchange from discriminating \nagainst an individual healthcare facility or provider because of an unwillingness to provide, pay \nfor, provide coverage of, or refer for abortions.  Id. § 18023(b)(4).  Myriad other federal laws offer \nsimilar protection.  The Weldon Amendment, which consistently appears in HHS appropriations \nlegislation, prevents federal agencies from discriminating against healthcare entities based on \n(identical to Section 1303) refusal to provide, pay for, provide coverage of, or refer for abortions.  \nSee Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2019, Pub. L. No. 115-245, Div. B, § 507(d)(1), 132 Stat. \n2981,  3118  (2018).    The  Coats-Snowe  Amendment  prohibits  the  federal  government  from \ndiscriminating against healthcare entities that decline to perform, refer for, or undergo training for \nabortions.  42 U.S.C. § 238n(a)(1).  And the Church Amendments guarantee that a recipient of \ncertain sources of federal funds cannot be compelled to perform or assist in sterilization procedures \n6 \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 124   Filed 01/19/21   Page 7 of 57\nor abortions if “contrary to [the recipient’s] religious beliefs or moral objections.”  42 U.S.C. § \n300a-7(b)(1).   \nHaving jettisoned the Title IX exemptions, HHS settled on a narrower exclusion.  The 2016 \nRule  excepted  applications  that  “would  violate  applicable  Federal  statutory  protections  for \nreligious freedom and conscience.”  81 Fed. Reg. at 31,466 (formerly codified at 45 C.F.R. § \n92.2(c)).  More specifically, HHS explained that the RFRA “is the proper means to evaluate any \nreligious concerns about the application of Section 1557 requirements.”  Id. at 31,380.  HHS went \non to note that it would evaluate “individualized and fact specific” RFRA claims “on a case-by-\ncase basis.”  Id.  To obtain an exception, in other words, a provider objecting on religious grounds \nneeded to convince HHS that the regulation circumstantially violated the RFRA.  Doc. No. 95, ¶ \n51.  Otherwise, an objecting provider’s last resort rested in federal court.  Id. \nThe 2016 Rule had implications for employers outside the healthcare context as well.  Title \nVII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 bans all employers with 15 or more employees—whether \nreceiving federal funding or not—from engaging in sex discrimination.4  42 U.S.C. §§ 2000e-2(a), \n2000e(b).  The EEOC holds primary responsibility for interpreting and enforcing Title VII.  See \nGriggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U.S. 424, 433-34 (1971).  HHS coordinated with the EEOC to \nexpand the 2016 Rule’s reach to otherwise noncovered entities through Title VII’s analogous ban \non sex discrimination.  See 81 Fed. Reg. at 31,432. \nUnderstanding that relationship demands more explanation.  Recall that HHS designated \nhealth plans with categorical exclusions for gender-transition services as facially discriminatory.  \nId. at 31,429.  That meant health insurers and TPAs receiving federal financial assistance could \n \n4 Title VII similarly mandates an employer to reasonably accommodate employees’ religious \nbeliefs unless doing so results in undue hardship on the employer’s business.  See 42 U.S.C. § \n2000e(j); 29 C.F.R. § 1605.2(c). \n7 \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 124   Filed 01/19/21   Page 8 of 57\nnot issue or administer such exclusions without potential exposure to Section 1557 liability—even \nif the entities they contracted with fell entirely outside the regulation’s scope.  Id. at 31,432.  As a \ncorollary, employers that wished to exclude coverage for gender-transition services in their group \nhealth plans faced a disincentive to do so if contracting with a covered entity.  Id. \nThe situation became especially precarious for TPAs.  The Employee Retirement Income \nSecurity Act of 1974 (“ERISA”) compels TPAs to administer health plans as written.  29 U.S.C. \n§ 1104(a)(1)(D).  So if a self-insured employer designed a health plan on its own with a categorical \ngender-transition exclusion, ERISA would require that employer’s TPA to administer the plan by \nits terms.  81 Fed. Reg. at 31,432.  But the 2016 Rule would have simultaneously found the TPA’s \nadministration of the same plan unlawfully discriminatory.  Id. at 31,429.  Recognizing that \ndichotomy,  HHS  committed  to  “adjusting”  enforcement  by  initially  determining  “whether \nresponsibility for the decision or other action alleged to be discriminatory rests with the employer \nor with the [TPA].”  Id. at 31,432.  If the latter, HHS would commence enforcement proceedings \nas usual.  Id.  If the former, however, jurisdictional limitations prevented the agency from pursuing \nenforcement unless the employer already qualified as a covered health program or activity.  Id.    \nThat jurisdictional gap is where the EEOC entered the picture.  HHS explained the \ncoordinated response this way: \nWhere, for example, [HHS] lacks jurisdiction over an employer responsible for \nbenefit design, [HHS] typically will refer or transfer the matter to the EEOC and \nallow that agency to address the matter.  The EEOC has informed [HHS] that, \nprovided  the  filing  meets  the  requirements  for  an  EEOC  charge,  the  date  a \ncomplaint was filed with [HHS] will be deemed the date it was filed with the EEOC.  \n \nId.  By the time HHS promulgated the 2016 Rule, the EEOC had already interpreted Title VII to \nprotect against gender-identity discrimination as an inherent form of sex discrimination.  See Macy \nv. Holder, EEOC Appeal No. 0120120821, 2012 WL 1435995, at *7 (Apr. 20, 2012).  In plain \n8 \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 124   Filed 01/19/21   Page 9 of 57\nterms, then, HHS indicated that the EEOC would pursue Title VII enforcement actions against \nnonhealthcare employers with gender-transition exclusions in their group health plans.  See Doc. \nNo. 97, ¶ 165.  \n  2.  Litigation Challenging the 2016 Rule \n  The 2016 Rule quickly drew legal challenges.  One month after the regulation took partial \neffect, a group of states and religious healthcare providers brought suit in the Northern District of \nTexas.  Franciscan All., Inc. v. Burwell, Case No. 7:16-cv-00108, Doc. No. 1 (N.D. Tex. Aug. 23, \n2016).  Similar coalitions sued in this district not long after.  Religious Sisters of Mercy v. Burwell, \nCase No. 3:16-cv-00386, Doc. No. 1 (D.N.D. Nov. 7, 2016); Cath. Benefits Assoc. v. Burwell, \nCase No. 3:16-cr-00432, Doc. No. 1 (D.N.D. Dec. 28, 2016).  This Court eventually consolidated \nthe Religious Sisters of Mercy and Catholic Benefits Association cases.  Doc. No. 37. \n  On December 31, 2016, the Franciscan Alliance court entered a nationwide preliminary \ninjunction.  227 F. Supp. 3d 660, 695 (N.D. Tex. 2016).  The court’s order barred enforcement of \nthe 2016 Rule insofar as it prohibited discrimination based on “gender identity” and “termination \nof  pregnancy.”    Id.    The  court  first  concluded  that  the  regulation  violated  the  APA  by \nimpermissibly expanding the scope of sex discrimination under Title IX to encompass gender \nidentity.  Id. at 689.  Next, the court faulted HHS’s decision to omit Title IX’s religious and \nabortion-neutrality exemptions.  Id. at 691.  The court then determined that the regulation’s \nmandate for healthcare entities to perform and insure gender-transition and abortion procedures \nimposed a substantial burden on the private plaintiffs’ exercise of religion.  Id. at 692.  Finally, the \ncourt found that HHS failed to show that the 2016 Rule satisfied strict scrutiny under the RFRA.  \nId. at 693. \n9 \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 124   Filed 01/19/21   Page 10 of 57\n  In the meantime, this Court stayed enforcement of the 2016 Rule against the named \nPlaintiffs.  Doc. No. 23.  The Court later clarified that the stay only prevented enforcement of the \nregulation’s “prohibitions against discrimination on the bases of gender identity and termination \nof pregnancy.”  Doc. No. 36.  Further, the Court acknowledged the extant nationwide preliminary \ninjunction in Franciscan Alliance.  Id. \n  With  key  aspects  of  the  2016  Rule  on  hold  and  the  onset  of  a  new  presidential \nadministration, HHS resolved to return to the drawing board.  In late May 2017, the Defendants \nrequested a voluntary  remand and stay in these cases to permit  the agency  “to  assess the \nreasonableness, necessity, and efficacy” of the challenged regulation.  Doc. No. 45.  HHS also \nexpressed a desire “to address certain issues identified by” the Franciscan Alliance court in its \npreliminary injunction decision.  Id.  The Court granted the Defendants’ motion and imposed a \nstay on August 24, 2017.  Doc. No. 56.  The Franciscan Alliance court ordered a similar stay.  Civil \nAction No. 7:16-cv-00108-O, 2017 WL 3616652, at *5 (N.D. Tex. July 10, 2017). \n  Over a year passed while a draft of a new proposed rule circulated through the federal \nbureaucracy.  See Doc. Nos. 57, 58, 59, 61, 62, 64.  Then in December 2018, the Franciscan \nAlliance litigation restarted.  Case No. 7:16-cv-00108, Doc. No. 126 (N.D. Tex. Dec. 17, 2018).  \nThe plaintiffs in that case promptly moved for summary judgment and permanent injunctive relief.  \nSee, e.g., id., Doc. No. 136 (N.D. Tex. Feb. 4, 2019). \n  In June 2019, while those motions remained pending, HHS issued a Notice of Proposed \nRulemaking that sought to revise the 2016 Rule.  See Nondiscrimination in Health and Heath \nEducation Programs or Activities, 84 Fed. Reg. 27,846 (proposed June 14, 2019) (“NPRM”).  \nAmong other things, the NPRM proposed to repeal the 2016 Rule’s definition of “on the basis of \nsex” in its entirety.  Id. at 27,857.  But HHS then pointed out that the United States Supreme Court \n10 \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 124   Filed 01/19/21   Page 11 of 57\nhad recently granted three petitions for writs of certiorari—consolidated and later decided as \nBostock v. Clayton County, 590 U.S. ___, 140 S. Ct. 1731 (2020)—in part to determine whether \nTitle VII’s proscription of sex discrimination equated to a bar on gender-identity discrimination.  \n84  Fed.  Reg.  at  27,855;  see  also  139  S.  Ct.  1599  (2019)  (mem.)  (granting  certiorari  and \nconsolidating cases).  The NPRM acknowledged that “[b]ecause Title IX adopts the substantive \nand legal standards of Title VII, a holding by the U.S. Supreme Court on the definition of ‘sex’ \nunder Title VII will likely have ramifications for the definition of ‘sex’ under Title IX.”  84 Fed. \nReg. at 27,855 (footnote omitted).  With Bostock looming, HHS declined to propose a new \ndefinition of “sex” in the NPRM.  Id. at 27,857.  The agency instead demurred to “allow the Federal \ncourts, in particular, the U.S. Supreme Court, to resolve any dispute about” that term’s “proper \nlegal interpretation.”  Id. at 27,873. \n  Four months after HHS rolled out the NPRM, the Franciscan Alliance court granted \nsummary judgment for the plaintiffs.  414 F. Supp. 3d 928 (N.D. Tex. 2019).  The court adhered \nto the reasoning in its preliminary injunction decision and concluded that the 2016 Rule violated \nboth the RFRA and the APA.  Id. at 942-43.  Yet the court stopped short of entering a nationwide \npermanent injunction against enforcement of the 2016 Rule’s prohibitions on discrimination based \non gender identity and termination of pregnancy.  Id. at 946.  Instead, the court elected to vacate \nthose portions of the regulation and remand to HHS for further consideration.  Id.  Neither party \nappealed on the merits.  But the plaintiffs appealed the denial of injunctive relief to the Fifth Circuit \nCourt of Appeals, where briefing wrapped up in early December.  See Franciscan All., Inc. v. Azar, \nUSCA No. 20-10093 (5th Cir. Jan. 24, 2020).  \n \n \n11 \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 124   Filed 01/19/21   Page 12 of 57\n  3.  The 2020 Rule \n  HHS finalized a new rule interpreting Section 1557 on June 12, 2020.  See Section 1557 \nof the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, U.S. Dep’t of Health & Human Servs., https:// \nwww.hhs.gov/civil-rights/for-individuals/section-1557/index.html  (last  visited  Jan.  19,  2021).  \nPublication in the Federal Register occurred one week later.  Nondiscrimination in Health and \nHealth Education Programs or Activities, 85 Fed. Reg. 37,160 (June 19, 2020) (“2020 Rule”).  The \n2020 Rule marks a significant shift from HHS’s original Section 1557 interpretation.   \n  In scope, the 2020 Rule applies more narrowly than its predecessor in two respects.  First, \nHHS redefined “health program or activity” to eliminate blanket regulatory application to entities \n“principally or otherwise engaged in the business of providing health insurance.”  45 C.F.R. § \n92.3(c).  Health insurers remain subject to Section 1557 for the specific parts of their operations \nthat receive federal financial assistance.  See id. § 92.3(b) (“For any entity not principally engaged \nin the business of providing healthcare, the requirements applicable to a ‘health program or \nactivity’ under this part shall apply to such entity’s operations only to the extent any such operation \nreceives Federal financial assistance.”).  The revision indicates only that the entirety of federally \nfunded insurers’ operations no longer automatically qualifies for regulation merely by virtue of \nselling or administering health insurance plans.  See 85 Fed. Reg. at 37,172.  And second, whereas \nthe 2016 Rule extended to all HHS-administered programs, the 2020 Rule applies exclusively to \nthe agency’s programs administered under Title I of the ACA.  45 C.F.R. § 92.3(a).  That means \nsome programs administered by, for example, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services \nand the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention likely now fall outside Section 1557’s reach.  \nSee 85 Fed. Reg. at 37,170-71. \n12 \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 124   Filed 01/19/21   Page 13 of 57\n  True to the NPRM, the 2020 Rule repealed the definition of “on the basis of sex” in full.  \nId. at 37,167.  HHS reverted to stating that discrimination is barred on the ground prohibited by \nTitle IX without supplemental definition.  See 45 C.F.R. § 92.2(b)(2).  Still, HHS took the position \nthat the “extension of sex-discrimination protections to encompass gender identity was contrary to \nthe text of Title IX.”  85 Fed. Reg. at 37,168.  The agency repeatedly leaned on the Solicitor \nGeneral’s amicus curiae brief in Bostock to support that stance.  See id. at 37,178, 37,194, 37,195.  \nThat notwithstanding, HHS reaffirmed its expectation that Bostock—however decided—would \nimpact the meaning of “on the basis of sex” under Title IX.  Id. at 37,168.  HHS suggested that the \nrepeal “would not preclude application of the [Bostock] Court’s construction” of the phrase.  Id. \n  In a similar vein, HHS dispensed with the 2016 Rule’s prohibition on categorical gender-\ntransition exclusions in covered entities’ health plans.  Id. at 37,201.  The agency asserted a lack \nof “statutory authority to require the provision or coverage of such procedures under Title IX \nprotections from discrimination on the basis of sex.”  Id. at 37,198.  HHS further concluded that \nthe coverage mandate had improperly preempted legitimate medical debate, explaining that “the \nmedical community is divided on many issues related to gender identity, including the value of \nvarious ‘gender-affirming’ treatments for gender dysphoria.”  Id. at 37,187. \n  The 2020 Rule also expanded and clarified available exceptions to Section 1557.  Id. at \n37,204.  Namely, HHS incorporated the Title IX religious and abortion-neutrality exemptions.  See \n45 C.F.R. § 92.6(b) (stating that any application that would contradict exemptions provided by \nSection 1557’s four incorporated civil rights statutes, including Title IX, “shall not be imposed or \nrequired”).  The 2020 Rule additionally set out an explicit, though not exhaustive, list of federal \nreligious freedom and conscience provisions that would override application of Section 1557 in \n13 \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 124   Filed 01/19/21   Page 14 of 57\nsome circumstances.  Id.  That list included the RFRA, Section 1303 of the ACA, the Weldon \nAmendment, the Coats-Snow Amendment, and the Church Amendments.  Id. \n  4.  Bostock and Litigation Challenging the 2020 Rule \n  On June 15, 2020, the Supreme Court decided Bostock—just three days after HHS \nfinalized the 2020 Rule.5  The Court held that firing an employee for being homosexual or \ntransgender constitutes sex discrimination under Title VII because such a decision “necessarily \nand intentionally discriminates against that individual in part because of sex.”  Bostock, 140 S. Ct. \nat 1744.  In so holding, the Court assumed that “sex” referred “only to biological distinctions \nbetween male and female.”  Id. at 1739.  Even with that assumption, the Court deemed it \n“impossible  to  discriminate  against  a  person  for  being  homosexual  or  transgender  without \ndiscriminating against that individual based on sex.”  Id. at 1741. \n  Bostock arrived with caveats, however.  The Court warned that its decision did not \n“prejudge” any “other federal or state laws that prohibit sex discrimination.”  Id. at 1753.  Indeed, \na dissent from Justice Alito went so far as to identify Section 1557 as having the potential to \n“emerge as an intense battleground under the Court’s holding.”  Id. at 1781 (Alito, J., dissenting).  \nAnd the Court separately expressed continued commitment to safeguarding employers’ religious \nconvictions.  Id. at 1753-54 (majority opinion).  Referencing the RFRA by name, the Court \ncategorized it as “a kind  of super statute” that “might  supersede Title VII’s commands in \nappropriate cases.”  Id. at 1754. \n  A flurry of litigation commenced in the wake of Bostock.  Almost immediately, five cases \nsprung up seeking to prevent enforcement of the 2020 Rule and to revive various aspects of the \n2016 Rule.  See Whitman-Walker Clinic, Inc. v. U.S. Dep’t of Health & Human Servs., Case No. \n \n5 Bostock preceded the 2020 Rule’s publication in the Federal Register by four days. \n14 \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 124   Filed 01/19/21   Page 15 of 57\n1:20-cv-01630 (D.D.C. June 22, 2020); Walker v. Azar, Case No. 1:20-cv-02834 (E.D.N.Y. June \n26, 2020); Boston All. of Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual & Transgender Youth v. U.S. Dep’t of Health & \nHuman Servs., Case No. 1:20-cv-11297 (D. Mass. July 9, 2020); Washington v. U.S. Dep’t of \nHealth & Human Servs, Case No. 2:20-cv-01105 (W.D. Wash. July 16, 2020); New York v. U.S. \nDep’t of Health & Human Servs., Case No. 1:20-cv-05583 (S.D.N.Y. July 20, 2020).  Briefing on \ndispositive motions is ongoing in two of those cases, while district courts have decided preliminary \ninjunction motions in the other three. \n  In  Boston  Alliance  and  New  York,  where  dispositive  motions  remain  pending,  the \nplaintiffs challenge the 2020 Rule’s repeal of specific protections against discrimination based on \ngender identity and termination of pregnancy, as well as its incorporation of Title IX’s religious \nand abortion-neutrality exemptions.  See Case No. 1:20-cv-11297, Doc. No. 1, ¶¶ 166-80 (D. Mass. \nJuly 9, 2020); Case No. 1:20-cv-05583, Doc. No. 1, ¶ 86 (S.D.N.Y. July 20, 2020).  As for \nWashington, the court denied a preliminary injunction motion and dismissed that case for lack of \nstanding.  CASE NO. C20-1105JLR, --- F. Supp. 3d ----, 2020 WL 5095467 (W.D. Wash. Aug. \n28, 2020).  The court centrally reasoned that, after Bostock, the plaintiffs failed to show an \nimminent  risk  of  injury  because  the  2020  Rule  possibly  protected  against  gender-identity \ndiscrimination under a straightforward reading of Title IX’s “on the basis of sex” language—even \nwithout the 2016 Rule’s definitional provision.  Id. at *7.  \n  In the two remaining cases, the district courts entered partially overlapping preliminary \ninjunctions.  Walker v. Azar, Case No. 20-CV-2834 (FB) (SMG), --- F. Supp. 3d ----, 2020 WL \n4749859, at *10 (E.D.N.Y. Aug. 17, 2020); Whitman-Walker Clinic, Inc. v. U.S. Dep’t of Health \n& Human Servs., Civil Action No. 20-1630 (JEB), --- F. Supp. 3d ----, 2020 WL 5232076, at *45 \n(D.D.C. Sept. 2, 2020).  Both courts determined that the 2020 Rule violated the APA by failing to \n15 \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 124   Filed 01/19/21   Page 16 of 57\nconsider Bostock prior to publication.  See Walker, 2020 WL 4749859, at *9; Whitman-Walker, \n2020 WL 5232076, at *26.  Yet the chosen remedies differed slightly. \nThe Walker court’s order reinstates the 2016 Rule’s definition of “on the basis of sex” to \nencompass “gender identity” and “sex stereotyping.”  2020 WL 4749859, at *10.  The court also \nlater enjoined the repeal of the former 45 C.F.R. § 92.206, which essentially repeats the prohibition \nagainst discrimination based on gender identity in the provision of health services.  Walker v. Azar, \nCase No. 20-CV-2834 (FB) (SMG), 2020 WL 6363970, at *4 (E.D.N.Y. Oct. 29, 2020). \nBy contrast, the preliminary injunction entered by the Whitman-Walker court revives only \nthe 2016 Rule’s “sex stereotyping” definition.  2020 WL 5232076, at *26.  Even so, the court \nfound that definition broad enough to protect against discrimination based on gender identity too.  \nId. at *23.  Lastly, the court blocked the 2020 Rule’s incorporation of the Title IX religious \nexemption.  Id. at *29.  Although declining to deem incorporation of the religious exemption \nsubstantively invalid, the court nevertheless concluded that HHS had failed to adequately weigh \nthe impact it might have on access to healthcare.  Id. \n  All other aspects of the 2020 Rule remain in effect today.  The two courts that granted \npreliminary injunction motions passed up invitations to enjoin the regulation in total.  Walker, \n2020 WL 6363970, at *1; Whitman-Walker, 2020 WL 5232076, at *45.  So incorporation of the \nTitle IX abortion-neutrality exemption is still effective, as are the repeal of “termination of \npregnancy” from the definition of sex discrimination, the repeal of the insurance coverage mandate \nfor  gender-transition  services,  the  inclusion  of  specific  overriding  religious  freedom  and \nconscience protections, and the narrower scope of application to health insurers.  See Walker, 2020 \nWL 6363970, at *2-3 (enumerating provisions in 2020 Rule not subject to injunctions).  Also \nworth noting, HHS recently appealed both adverse preliminary injunction decisions.  See Walker \n16 \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 124   Filed 01/19/21   Page 17 of 57\nv. Azar, USCA No. 20-3827 (D.C. Cir. Nov. 10, 2020); Whitman-Walker Clinic, Inc. v. U.S. Dep’t \nof Health & Human Servs., USCA No. 20-5331 (2d Cir. Nov. 9, 2020). \n  Throughout the last four and a half years of fluid regulatory interpretations and litigation \nsurrounding Section 1557, the EEOC’s interpretation of Title VII as applied to employers’ group \nhealth plans has stayed static.  Doc. No. 97, ¶ 160.  The EEOC—before and after Bostock—has \ntaken the consistent position that Title VII protects against discrimination based on gender identity.  \nCompare Doc. No. 97-7 (EEOC guidance document on protections for LGBT workers from \nDecember 2016), with What You Should Know: The EEOC and Protections for LGBT Workers, \nU.S. Equal Emp’t Opportunity Comm’n, https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/guidance/what-you-should-\nknow-eeoc-and-protections-lgbt-workers  (last  visited  Jan.  19,  2021)  (contemporary  EEOC \nguidance document on protections for LGBT workers).  In line with that stance, the EEOC has \npursued enforcement actions against nonhealthcare employers that categorically exclude coverage \nfor gender transitions from their health plans.  See Doc. No. 97, ¶¶ 156-59. \n  C.  Introduction of Parties \nFour Catholic organizations and the State of North Dakota comprise the Plaintiffs in \nReligious Sisters of Mercy.    In  Catholic Benefits Association, the Plaintiffs consist  of the \nnamesake organization and three of its members, all affiliated with the Catholic Church.  The \nDefendants are agencies and appointed officials of the United States government responsible for \npromulgating and enforcing the challenged interpretations of federal law. \n  1.  Religious Sisters of Mercy Plaintiffs \n  Plaintiff Religious Sisters of Mercy is a Catholic order of religious sisters devoted to works \nof mercy, including offering healthcare to the underserved.  Doc. No. 96-2, ¶ 2.  Located in Alma, \nMichigan, the Religious Sisters of Mercy is a nonprofit corporation officially approved by the \n17 \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 124   Filed 01/19/21   Page 18 of 57\nVatican.  Id. ¶ 3.  The sisters choose to follow their faith by offering care to those suffering from \nphysical, psychological, intellectual, and spiritual ailments.  Id. ¶ 4.  As part of that mission, some \nsisters serve as licensed healthcare professionals.  Id. ¶ 5; see also Doc. No. 96-5, ¶ 2. \n  The Religious Sisters of Mercy own and operate Plaintiff Sacred Heart Mercy Health Care \nCenter (“Sacred Heart”), a nonprofit clinic located in Alma, Michigan.  Doc. No. 96-2, ¶ 6.  Several \nof the sisters work at Sacred Heart as doctors, nurses, or other healthcare professionals.  Id.  The \nclinic serves poor, disabled, and elderly Medicare and Medicaid patients and provides low-cost or \nfree care to uninsured individuals.  Id. ¶ 8.  The Religious Sisters of Mercy operate Sacred Heart \nin accordance with the Ethical and Religious Directives for Catholic Healthcare Services issued \nby the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops.  Id. ¶ 6. \n  Plaintiff SMP Health System is a nonprofit health system sponsored by another Catholic \nreligious order, the Sisters of Mary of the Presentation.  Doc. No. 96-3, ¶ 4.  Headquartered in \nValley City, North Dakota, SMP Health System operates healthcare facilities in North Dakota and \nIllinois.  Id. ¶ 3.  It places special emphasis on providing services to the poor and elderly, including \nMedicare and Medicaid patients.  Id. ¶ 4.  The Sisters of Mary of the Presentation operate SMP \nHealth System in a manner that abides by the Ethical and Religious Directives for Catholic \nHealthcare Services issued by the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops.  Id. ¶ 5.    \n  Plaintiff University of Mary (“University”) is a Roman Catholic, Benedictine higher \neducation institution with its main campus in Bismarck, North Dakota.  Doc. No. 96-4, ¶¶ 5-6.  \nWhile welcoming students of all faiths and backgrounds, the University upholds Catholic teaching \nin its programs and services.  Id. ¶ 6.  The University offers a nursing program and operates a \nstudent health clinic that each receive funding from HHS.  Id. ¶¶ 8, 10. \n18 \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 124   Filed 01/19/21   Page 19 of 57\n  Consistent with their Catholic faith, each of these Plaintiffs believes “that every man and \nwoman is created in the image and likeness of God, and that they reflect God’s image in unique—\nand uniquely dignified—ways.”  Doc. Nos. 96-2, ¶ 9; 96-3, ¶ 6; 96-4, ¶ 9.  When providing medical \nservices,  these  Plaintiffs  serve  every  person  who  needs  and  qualifies  for  care,  including \ntransgender individuals.  Doc. Nos. 96-2, ¶ 7; 96-3, ¶ 7; 96-6, ¶ 4.  Nonetheless, they believe that \nperforming gender-transition procedures would violate their medical judgment by potentially \ncausing harm to patients.  Doc. Nos. 96-2, ¶ 11; 96-5, ¶ 9.  They also believe that performing \ngender-transition, abortion, and sterilization services would violate their religious beliefs regarding \nhuman sexuality and procreation.  Doc. Nos. 96-2, ¶ 12; 96-3, ¶¶ 8-10; 96-4, ¶ 10.  Finally, these \nPlaintiffs offer health benefits to their eligible employees, and they object for religious reasons to \nproviding insurance coverage for abortions, sterilizations, and gender transitions.  Doc. Nos. 96-\n2, ¶ 15; 96-3, ¶ 11; 96-4, ¶ 13.     \n  Plaintiff North Dakota oversees and controls several state agencies that receive financial \nassistance from HHS.  Doc. No. 95, ¶ 12.  For example, the North Dakota Department of Human \nServices received nearly $900 million in Medicaid funding in the most recent fiscal year.  Doc. \nNo. 96-8, ¶ 4.  Additionally, North Dakota operates a State Hospital in Jamestown that provides \npsychiatric and chemical dependency treatment in part through HHS-administered funds.  Doc. \nNo. 95, ¶ 12.  The state’s Medicaid program excludes coverage for abortions (with exceptions for \nrape, incest, or to save the life of the mother) and gender reassignment surgeries.  Medical Servs. \nDiv., N.D. Dep’t of Human Servs., General Information for Providers: North Dakota Medicaid \nand Other Medical Assistance Programs 85 (2021).  North Dakota’s employee health plan excludes \ncoverage for similar services.  Doc. No. 95, ¶ 165.  The state also employs licensed healthcare \nprofessionals and offers health benefits to those employees and their families.  Id. ¶ 12.  \n19 \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 124   Filed 01/19/21   Page 20 of 57\n  2.  Catholic Benefits Association Plaintiffs \n  Plaintiff Catholic Benefits Association (“CBA”) is a nonprofit corporation and Catholic \nministry.  Doc. No. 97-1, p. 1.  Among other purposes, the CBA is organized “[t]o support Catholic \nemployers . . . that, as part of their religious witness and exercise, provide health or other benefits \nto their respective employees in a manner that is consistent with Catholic values.”  Id. at 2.  The \nCBA’s membership includes over 1,030 employers and 5,100 Catholic parishes within more than \n60  dioceses  and  archdioceses,  collectively  covering  more  than  90,000  employees  and  their \nfamilies.  Doc. No. 97, ¶¶ 53-54.  Membership in the CBA is limited to Catholic employers that \ncommit to providing benefits or services consistent with Catholic values.  Doc. No. 97-2, p. 4.  \nMany  CBA  members  offer  healthcare  or  health-related  services  that  receive  funding  from \nMedicare, Medicaid, or other HHS-administered programs.  Doc. No. 97, ¶¶ 54-56.  And some \nemployer members, including Catholic dioceses and archdioceses, offer employee health benefits \nin conjunction with health insurers and TPAs that receive federal financial assistance.  Id. ¶ 57. \n  The three remaining Plaintiffs are CBA members.  Plaintiff Diocese of Fargo (“Diocese”) \ncarries out the spiritual, educational, and social service mission of the Catholic Church in eastern \nNorth Dakota.  Id. ¶ 11.  The Diocese employs more than 15 individuals and operates a self-insured \nhealth plan for its employees.  Id. ¶¶ 14, 19.  Many Catholic parishes and affiliated ministries \nwithin the Diocese participate in that plan as well.  Id. ¶ 23.  The Diocese has engaged Blue Cross \nBlue Shield of North Dakota (“BCBSND”)—an entity that receives federal financial assistance \nthrough an ACA exchange—as a TPA to administer its health plan.  Id. ¶¶ 19-20.  BCBSND has \nrequired the Diocese to enter into an indemnification agreement for decisions related to health plan \ndesign, such as the exclusion of gender-transition and abortion coverage.  Id. ¶ 22. \n20 \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 124   Filed 01/19/21   Page 21 of 57\n  Plaintiff Catholic Charities North Dakota (“Catholic Charities”) serves the poor, elderly, \nand disabled through critical social service programs.  Id. ¶ 24.  Its programs include disaster relief, \nindividual and family counseling, adoption services, pregnancy counseling, and guardianship \nservices for adults with special needs.  Id.  Catholic Charities employs more than 15 individuals.  \nId. ¶ 26.  To provide benefits to its employees, Catholic Charities contracts with an insurer that \nreceives federal financial assistance from HHS.  Id. ¶¶ 28-29.   \n  Plaintiff Catholic Medical Association (“CMA”) is a national, physician-led community of \nhealthcare professionals that strives to uphold the principles of the Catholic faith in the science \nand practice of medicine.  Id. ¶ 30.  Member physicians must promise to adhere to Catholic moral \nprinciples, particularly those related to bio-medical ethics.  Id. ¶ 32.  Consistent with their faith, \nCMA members do not provide gender-transition services, but some do perform procedures like \nhysterectomies and mastectomies that other physicians perform as part of gender transitions.  Id. \n¶ 34.  Some CMA members also offer health benefits for employees that exclude coverage for \ngender transitions and abortion.  Id. ¶ 37.   \n  3.  Defendants \n  Defendant United States Department of Health and Human Services is the federal agency \ntasked with implementing and enforcing Section 1557.  Doc. No. 95, ¶ 66.  Sued in his official \ncapacity, Defendant Alex M. Azar II is the Secretary of HHS.  Id. ¶ 67.  HHS and Secretary Azar \nare  Defendants  in  both  consolidated  cases.    Defendant  Equal  Employment  Opportunity \nCommission is the federal agency charged with implementing and enforcing Title VII.  Id. ¶ 68.  \nSued in her official capacity, Defendant Janet Dhillon is the Chair of the EEOC.  Id. ¶ 69.  The \nEEOC and Chair Dhillon are Defendants solely in Catholic Benefits Association. \n \n21 \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 124   Filed 01/19/21   Page 22 of 57\n  D.  Recent Procedural Developments \nOn November 6, 2020, the Plaintiffs moved to lift the stay.  Doc. No. 92.  The Court granted \nthe motion and set deadlines for amended complaints and responses.  Doc. No. 93.  On November \n23, 2020, the Plaintiffs timely filed amended complaints and contemporaneously moved for partial \nsummary judgment and permanent injunctive relief.  Doc. Nos. 95-98.   \nInvoking the RFRA, the APA, and the Spending Clause of the Constitution, the Religious \nSisters of Mercy Plaintiffs seek relief from HHS’s current interpretation of Section 1557.  Doc. \nNo. 96.  The Catholic Benefits Association Plaintiffs, relying exclusively on the RFRA, request \nrelief from the same interpretation of Section 1557, as well from parallel interpretations of Title \nVII, Title IX, or any other federal laws.  Doc. No. 98.  In the alternative, all the Plaintiffs move for \na preliminary injunction.  Doc. No. 96-1, p. 2; Doc. No. 104, p. 29. \n  The Defendants responded in opposition to the motions on December 23, 2020.  Doc. No. \n111.  Accompanying the response, the Defendants moved to dismiss both cases in their entirety \nfor lack of jurisdiction.  Doc. No. 112.  The Plaintiffs submitted final briefing on January 6, 2021.  \nDoc. Nos. 116-119.  The Court held a hearing on the motions on January 14, 2021.  Doc. No. 123.   \nII.  JURISDICTION \n  Federal courts must possess jurisdiction before reaching the merits of a case.  Va. House \nof Delegates v. Bethune-Hill, 587 U.S. ___, 139 S. Ct. 1945, 1950 (2019).  Article III of the \nConstitution limits federal judicial power to the resolution of “Cases” and “Controversies.”  Hein \nv. Freedom from Religion Found., Inc., 551 U.S. 587, 597 (2007).  Spawning from that limitation, \nthe frequently intertwined doctrines of standing, ripeness, and mootness all probe whether a \nsubsisting controversy warrants judicial intervention.  Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 499 n.10 \n(1975).  Because the case or controversy requirement rests on separation-of-powers principles, the \n22 \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 124   Filed 01/19/21   Page 23 of 57\ninquiry becomes “especially rigorous” where the judiciary is called upon to review the validity of \nactions taken by the political branches of government.  Clapper v. Amnesty Int’l USA, 568 U.S. \n398, 408-09 (2013) (citations omitted).  \n  A.  Standing \nStanding requires (1) an injury in fact, (2) causation, and (3) redressability.  Hughes v. City \nof Cedar Rapids, 840 F.3d 987, 992 (8th Cir. 2016).  An injury in fact is “the actual or imminent \ninvasion of a concrete and particularized legal interest.”  Kuehl v. Sellner, 887 F.3d 845, 850 (8th \nCir. 2018) (citations omitted).  Plaintiffs seeking declaratory and injunctive relief “must show they \nare experiencing an ongoing injury or an immediate threat of injury.”  Webb ex rel. K.S. v. Smith, \n936 F.3d 808, 815 (8th Cir. 2019) (citation omitted).  Causation is satisfied when the injury is \n“fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant, and not the result of the independent \naction of some third party not before the court.”  Balogh v. Lombardi, 816 F.3d 536, 543 (8th Cir. \n2016) (cleaned up).  Redressability is “a likelihood that the injury will be redressed by a favorable \ndecision.”  Kuehl, 887 F.3d at 850 (citations omitted). \nThe party invoking federal jurisdiction bears the burden to establish standing.  Lujan v. \nDefenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 561 (1992).  Courts “assume that on the merits the plaintiffs \nwould be successful in their claims” when analyzing standing.  Am. Farm Bureau Fed’n v. EPA, \n836 F.3d 963, 968 (8th Cir. 2016) (citation omitted).  Plaintiffs “must demonstrate standing \nseparately for each form of relief sought.”  Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Envtl. Servs. \n(TOC), Inc., 528 U.S. 167, 185 (2000) (citations omitted).    \n  The  Plaintiffs  contend  that  HHS’s  current  interpretation  of  Section  1557  will  cause \nimminent injury by forcing them to choose between performing and providing insurance coverage \nfor gender transitions and abortions or risking the loss of federal funding and other penalties.  The \n23 \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 124   Filed 01/19/21   Page 24 of 57\nCatholic Benefits Association Plaintiffs also raise the prospect of injury from interpretations of \nTitle VII, Title IX, and other federal laws that might compel the same actions.  The Defendants \ncounter that the judicial vacatur and later administrative repeal of the 2016 Rule abate any risk of \ninjury from Section 1557.  They further respond that the lack of imminent EEOC enforcement \ndooms the Title VII claims. \n  1.  Section 1557 \nSome claims against HHS’s interpretation of Section 1557 appear to center on the notion \nthat recent court decisions have fully reinstated the 2016 Rule.  Not so.  Much of the 2020 Rule \nremains operative, including provisions that obviate several asserted harms.  Insofar as the 2020 \nRule alleviated their injuries prior to submission of the most recent amended complaints, the \nPlaintiffs lack standing.  With that said, HHS’s interpretation of Section 1557—as influenced by \nBostock and the two nationwide preliminary injunctions against the 2020 Rule—provokes a \ncredible threat of enforcement for refusal to provide or insure gender-transition procedures. \nAt  the  outset,  though,  any  claims  regarding  forced  abortion  services  and  insurance \ncoverage  falter.6    The  2020  Rule  repealed  “termination  of  pregnancy”  from  the  regulatory \ndefinition of sex discrimination.  See 45 C.F.R. § 92.2(b)(2).  Added to that, HHS incorporated the \nTitle IX abortion-neutrality exemption and identified overriding religious freedom and conscience \nlaws that protect against the compulsory provision of abortions.  See 45 C.F.R. § 92.6(b).  No court \nhas enjoined those amendments to date, and nothing indicates that HHS imminently intends to \nreverse course and again remove them.  So the Plaintiffs cannot show existing injury because \nHHS’s interpretation of Section 1557 affords the exact protection they seek.   \n \n6 The parties have often treated the abortion-related claims as an afterthought since this litigation \ngained its second wind.  Excising these claims on the front end will streamline resolution of the \nremaining jurisdictional issues. \n24 \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 124   Filed 01/19/21   Page 25 of 57\nTrying to sidestep that reality, the Plaintiffs hint at the specter of future injury, highlighting \nthe pending Boston Alliance and New York cases that look to eliminate incorporation of the \nabortion-neutrality exemption.  But HHS opposes those lawsuits, and how other district courts may \nresolve them is plainly inappropriate for this Court to guess.  The Plaintiffs cannot use this \nlitigation to obtain preemptive judicial affirmation of an exception that HHS already recognizes.  \nSee KCCP Trust v. City of North Kansas City, 432 F.3d 897, 899 (8th Cir. 2005) (explaining that \nArticle III prohibits federal courts from issuing advisory opinions).  As interpreted today, Section \n1557 does not proscribe refusal to perform or insure abortions, leaving the Plaintiffs tilting at \nwindmills.  Lack of standing defeats the abortion-related claims.    \nTurning to the claims regarding compelled gender-transition procedures and insurance \ncoverage, the initial task is to separate the wheat from the chaff.  Despite consolidation, cases \njoined together under Rule 42(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure retain their “independent \ncharacter.”  Hall v. Hall, 584 U.S. ___, 138 S. Ct. 1118, 1125 (2018).  Each consolidated case \n“must be considered separately to determine whether or not this Court has jurisdiction to consider \nits merits.”  Butler v. Dexter, 425 U.S. 262, 267 n.12 (1976) (per curiam); see also Rich v. Lambert, \n53 U.S. 347, 352-53 (1851) (dismissing three of five consolidated cases for lack of jurisdiction).   \nA closer look at the two cases here reveals a preliminary difference for standing purposes.  \n“When a statute is challenged by a party who is a target or object of the statute’s prohibitions, \n‘there is ordinarily little question that the [statute] has caused him injury.’”  St. Paul Area Chamber \nof Com. v. Gaertner, 439 F.3d 481, 485 (8th Cir. 2006) (alteration in original) (quoting Minn. \nCitizens Concerned for Life v. FEC, 113 F.3d 129, 131 (8th Cir. 1997)).  The Religious Sisters of \nMercy Plaintiffs, as entities that operate health programs receiving federal financial assistance \nfrom HHS, qualify as objects of Section 1557 and its implementing regulations.  Conversely, \n25 \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 124   Filed 01/19/21   Page 26 of 57\n“when the plaintiff is not himself the object of the government action . . . he challenges, standing \nis not precluded, but it is ordinarily ‘substantially more difficult’ to establish.”  Summers v. Earth \nIsland Inst., 555 U.S. 488, 493 (2009) (quoting Lujan, 504 U.S. at 562).  Section 1557 does not \napply directly to the named Catholic Benefits Association Plaintiffs.  They assert instead that the \nstatute causes  them secondhand injury by mandating their insurers  and TPAs to  offer and \nadminister health plans that cover gender-transition procedures.   \nBut HHS’s interpretation of Section 1557 no longer does that.  The 2016 Rule applied to \nall operations of an entity principally engaged in the provision of health insurance.  81 Fed. Reg. \nat 31,467 (formerly codified at 45 C.F.R. § 92.4).  That interpretation indirectly impacted entities \nlike the Diocese and Catholic Charities.  While their own health insurance plans did not receive \nfederal financial assistance, other plans that their insurers and TPAs offered did, thereby triggering \nthe regulation.  With the 2020 Rule’s arrival, however, health insurers now remain subject to \nSection 1557 only for the parts of their operations that receive federal funding.  See 45 C.F.R. § \n92.3(b)-(c).  In explaining the revision’s primary import, HHS stated: “To the extent that employer-\nsponsored group health plans do not receive Federal financial assistance . . ., they would not be \ncovered entities.”  85 Fed. Reg. at 37,173; see also Doc. No. 97, ¶¶ 192-93 (summarizing the 2020 \nRule’s narrower application to health insurers). \nPrecisely so here.  None of the Catholic Benefits Association Plaintiffs aver that their own \nhealth plans receive federal funding.  For those health plans, then, the prevailing interpretation of \nSection 1557 does not require insurers or TPAs to cover gender-transition procedures.  Ongoing \nor future risk of injury is absent as a result.    \nAttempting to show otherwise, the CBA points out that “[a]s a result of the 2016 Rule, two \nCBA  members  already  have  been  required  to  cover  gender-transition  services  for  their \n26 \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 124   Filed 01/19/21   Page 27 of 57\nemployees.”  Doc. No. 119, p. 2.  And the Diocese “has been forced to indemnify its TPA against \nliability for exclusion of . . . gender-transition services from its health plan.”  Id. at 3.  Yet those \nharms emanate from since-repealed regulations, not existing HHS policy.  Past injuries alone \ncannot confer standing to pursue declaratory and injunctive relief.  Frost v. Sioux City, 920 F.3d \n1158, 1162 (8th Cir. 2019).  Without controlling regulations, if insurers and TPAs continue to \npressure the Catholic Benefits Association Plaintiffs to cover gender-transition procedures or enter \ninto indemnification agreements, such actions are not attributable to HHS.  See Balogh, 816 F.3d \nat 543.  Those Plaintiffs thus lack standing to challenge Section 1557 in their own capacities.  \nStill,  the  CBA  alternatively  asserts  the  ability  to  sue  on  behalf  of  its  members.  \nAssociational standing inheres when “(1) the individual members would have standing to sue in \ntheir own right; (2) the organization’s purpose relates to the interests being vindicated; and (3) the \nclaims asserted do not require the participation of individual members.”  Sierra Club v. U.S. Army \nCorps of Eng’rs, 645 F.3d 978, 986 (8th Cir. 2011) (citations omitted).  An organizational plaintiff \n“need not establish that all of its members would have standing to sue individually so long as it \ncan show that ‘any one of them’ would have standing.”  Iowa League of Cities v. EPA, 711 F.3d \n844, 869 (8th Cir. 2013) (quoting Warth, 422 U.S. at 511).  Members on whose behalf suit is \nbrought may remain unnamed.  Disability Rights Wis., Inc. v. Walworth Cnty. Bd. of Supervisors, \n522 F.3d 796, 802 (7th Cir. 2008); Doe v. Stincer, 175 F.3d 879, 882 (11th Cir. 1999). \nThe CBA easily satisfies the second and third requirements for associational standing.  The \nCBA’s  purpose  of  supporting  Catholic  employers  that  wish  to  provide  employee  benefits \nconsistent with their religious beliefs is certainly germane to a lawsuit that challenges regulations \naffecting members’ health plans.  See Doc. No. 97-1, p. 2.  And where an organizational plaintiff \n27 \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 124   Filed 01/19/21   Page 28 of 57\n“seeks only declaratory and prospective injunctive relief, the participation of individual [members] \n. . . is not required.”  Heartland Acad. Cmty. Church v. Waddle, 427 F.3d 525, 533 (8th Cir. 2005). \nAs for the ability of individual members to sue, the CBA’s verified second amended \ncomplaint confirms that its membership includes Catholic hospitals and other healthcare entities \n“that receive Medicaid and Medicare payments and participate in HHS-funded programs.”  Doc. \nNo. 97, ¶¶ 55-56.  That places at least some CBA members on equal footing with the Religious \nSisters of Mercy Plaintiffs.  The unified question then becomes whether those Plaintiffs—and, by \nimplication, the similarly situated CBA members—possess standing.   \nWhen  challenging  threatened  government  action,  plaintiffs  need  not  wait  for  actual \nenforcement to satisfy the injury-in-fact requirement.  Susan B. Anthony List v. Driehaus, 573 \nU.S. 149, 158 (2014).  Instead, they must demonstrate only “an intention to engage in a course of \nconduct arguably affected with a constitutional interest, but proscribed by a statute, and there exists \na credible threat of prosecution thereunder.”  Babbitt v. United Farm Workers Nat’l Union, 442 \nU.S. 289, 298 (1979).  Here, that standard is met. \n First, the Plaintiffs’ conduct implicates constitutional interests.  The Catholic healthcare \nentities’ refusal to perform or cover gender-transition procedures is predicated on an exercise of \ntheir religious beliefs protected by the First Amendment.  See United States v. Ali, 682 F.3d 705, \n709 (8th Cir. 2012) (explaining that the RFRA safeguards First Amendment free-exercise rights).  \nSimilarly, North Dakota’s abstention from providing or insuring such procedures originates from \nstate sovereignty interests embedded in the Spending Clause.  See Nat’l Fed’n of Indep. Bus., 567 \nU.S.  at  577  (expressing  concern  with  “ensuring  that  Spending  Clause  legislation  does  not \nundermine the status of the States as independent sovereigns in our federal system”).  Because the \nPlaintiffs’  intend  to  engage  in  protected  conduct,  “their  other  claims  are  affected  with  a \n28 \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 124   Filed 01/19/21   Page 29 of 57\nconstitutional interest too, regardless of the precise legal theory.”  Telescope Media Grp. v. Lucero, \n936 F.3d 740, 750 (8th Cir. 2019).     \nSecond, Section 1557 “arguably proscribe[s]” the Plaintiffs’ refusal to perform or cover \ngender-transition procedures.  Driehaus, 573 U.S. at 162.  True enough, HHS tried to repeal the \n2016 Rule’s explicit prohibition on gender-identity discrimination, firmly stating that “extension \nof sex-discrimination protections to encompass gender identity was contrary to the text of Title \nIX.”  85 Fed. Reg. at 37,168.  But that repeal never took effect.  Rather, two district courts entered \npartially overlapping preliminary injunctions that collectively reinstate the prior definition of “on \nthe basis of sex” to include “gender identity” and “sex stereotyping.”  Walker, 2020 WL 4749859, \nat *10; Whitman-Walker, 2020 WL 5232076, at *45.  The Whitman-Walker court further enjoined \nincorporation of the Title IX religious exemption.  Id.  As the Defendants readily acknowledge, \n“persons subject to an injunctive order issued by a court with jurisdiction are expected to obey that \ndecree until it is modified or reversed.”  GTE Sylvania, Inc. v. Consumers Union of U.S., Inc., 445 \nU.S. 375, 386 (1980).  Construing the same definitions that now control once again, HHS \npreviously classified the categorical refusal to perform or cover gender-transition procedures as \nunlawfully discriminatory.  81 Fed. Reg. at 31,471-72 (formerly codified at 45 C.F.R. §§ 92.206, \n92.207(b)(4)-(5)).  With the religious exemption enjoined too, a clear path for the Plaintiffs to \nincur liability under Section 1557 emerges. \nWhat is more, the Plaintiffs face potential consequences from the 2020 Rule even without \nthe injunctions.  That is so because HHS declined to promulgate a new regulatory definition for \n“sex,” instead leaving the door open to “application of the [Bostock] Court’s construction.”  85 \nFed. Reg. at 37,168.  The Supreme Court later held that Title VII proscribes discrimination based \non transgender status under a plain reading of the statute’s prohibition on sex discrimination.  \n29 \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 124   Filed 01/19/21   Page 30 of 57\nBostock, 140 S. Ct. at 1744.  HHS admitted that such a holding would “likely have ramifications \nfor the definition of ‘on the basis of sex’ under Title IX” and, in turn, Section 1557.  85 Fed. Reg. \nat 37,168.  Case law vindicates that prediction.  Relying on Bostock, the Fourth and Eleventh \nCircuits recently held that Title IX protects against discrimination based on gender identity.  \nGrimm v. Gloucester Cnty. Sch. Bd., 972 F.3d 586, 616 (4th Cir. 2020); Adams ex rel. Kasper v. \nSch. Bd. of St. Johns Cnty., 968 F.3d 1286, 1305 (11th Cir. 2020).  The Washington court, when \nreviewing a challenge to the 2020 Rule, further noted that the plaintiffs there “may be correct” that \n“Section 1557 and Title IX must now be interpreted to include concepts like gender identity” in \nlight of Bostock.  2020 WL 5095467, at *8.  Like those courts, the Eighth Circuit has long \nrecognized  that  “the  Supreme  Court’s  interpretation  of  Title  VII  properly  informs  [the] \nexamination of Title IX.”  Wolfe v. Fayetteville, Ark. Sch. Dist., 648 F.3d 860, 866 (8th Cir. 2011).  \nConsidering these decisions and HHS’s own statements, the Plaintiffs’ refusal to perform or cover \ngender-transition procedures arguably falls within the ambit of Section 1557.7   \nThird, a credible threat of enforcement endures.  Such a threat arises “when a course of \naction is within the plain text of a statute.”  Alexis Bailly Vineyard, Inc. v. Harrington, 931 F.3d \n774, 778 (8th Cir. 2019) (citing North Dakota v. Heydinger, 825 F.3d 912, 917 (8th Cir. 2016)).  \nAs just explained, Section 1557 is amenable to an interpretation that would expose the Plaintiffs \nto liability for declining to provide or insure gender-transition services.  And here “there is no \n‘evidence—via official policy or a long history of disuse—that authorities’ have ‘actually’ refused \nto enforce” the statute.  Jones v. Jegley, 947 F.3d 1100, 1104 (8th Cir. 2020) (quoting 281 Care \nComm. v. Arneson, 638 F.3d 621, 628 (8th Cir. 2011)).  To the contrary, HHS has undertaken two \n \n7 The Court ultimately does not decide whether Section 1557 protects against discrimination based \non gender identity. \n30 \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 124   Filed 01/19/21   Page 31 of 57\nrulemakings to refine enforcement parameters in the ten years following Section 1557’s enactment.  \nMost recently, HHS vowed in the 2020 Rule’s preamble to “vigorously enforce the prohibitions \non discrimination based on . . . sex.”  85 Fed. Reg. at 37,175.  That is more than sufficient to \nestablish a credible threat of enforcement.  The Plaintiffs satisfy the injury-in-fact requirement.   \nFinally,  HHS’s  responsibility  to  enforce  Section  1557  supplies  a  sufficient  causal \nrelationship to the asserted injuries, which declaratory and injunctive relief will likely redress.  For \na pre-enforcement constitutional challenge to a statute, “the causation element of standing requires \nthe named defendants to possess authority to enforce the complained-of provision.”  Calzone v. \nHawley, 866 F.3d 866, 869 (8th Cir. 2017) (quoting Dig. Recognition Network v. Hutchinson, 803 \nF.3d 952, 957-58 (8th Cir. 2015)).  HHS and Secretary Azar fit that bill for Section 1557.  \nRedressability is likewise plain because a favorable decision “will relieve a discrete injury” of \nthreatened enforcement.  Massachusetts v. EPA, 549 U.S. 497, 525 (2007) (citation omitted).   \nThe Defendants attempt to attack standing from several angles, but to no avail.  They first \ncontend  that  the  Franciscan  Alliance  court’s  vacatur  of  the  2016  Rule  and  the  ensuing \npromulgation of the 2020 Rule cured the Plaintiffs’ injuries altogether.  But since the Supreme \nCourt decided Bostock and two district courts followed with preliminary injunctions against parts \nof the 2020 Rule, Section 1557 presents the Plaintiffs with a renewed threat of financial sanctions, \ncivil enforcement proceedings, and even criminal penalties.   \nNext, the Defendants underscore that HHS has appealed the adverse preliminary injunction \ndecisions, apparently suggesting that the outcome of those proceedings could avert the need for \nthis litigation.  Yet a standing inquiry focuses exclusively on the facts that existed at the time of \nthe operative complaint.  Conners v. Gusano’s Chicago Style Pizzeria, 779 F.3d 835, 840 (8th Cir. \n31 \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 124   Filed 01/19/21   Page 32 of 57\n2015).  How HHS’s appeals might turn out in the future is irrelevant to whether the Plaintiffs faced \nan injury in fact when they submitted their amended complaints.   \nThis line of argument calls to mind the long-running litigation contesting the ACA’s \ncontraceptive mandate.  There, religious organizations challenged HHS regulations that required \nemployers to cover certain forms of contraceptives in their health plans.  See Little Sisters of the \nPoor Saints Peter & Paul Home v. Pennsylvania, 591 U.S. ___, 140 S. Ct. 2367, 2376 (2020) \n(collecting cases).  The Eighth Circuit determined that the mandate violated the RFRA and \naffirmed injunctive relief.  Sharpe Holdings, Inc. v. U.S. Dep’t of Health & Human Servs., 801 \nF.3d 927, 945-46 (8th Cir. 2015), vacated on other grounds sub nom. U.S. Dep’t of Health & \nHuman Servs. v. CNS Int’l Ministries, No. 15-775, 2016 WL 2842448 (U.S. May 16, 2016).  HHS \nlater issued new regulations in an effort to repeal the mandate.  See Little Sisters of the Poor, 140 \nS. Ct. at 2377-78.  Two district courts then preliminarily enjoined the repeal rules under the APA.  \nCalifornia v. U.S. Dep’t of Health & Human Servs., 281 F. Supp. 3d 806, 832 (N.D. Cal. 2017); \nPennsylvania v. Trump, 281 F. Supp. 3d 553, 585 (E.D. Pa. 2017).   \nIn  reaction,  religious  organizations  renewed  their  RFRA  claims  against  the  restored \nmandate.  District courts across the country—this one among them—exercised jurisdiction and \ngranted injunctive relief.  See Christian Emps. All. v. Azar, Case No. 3:16-cv-309, 2019 WL \n2130142, at *5-6 (D.N.D. May 15, 2019); see also DeOtte v. Azar, 393 F. Supp. 3d 490, 514-15 \n(N.D. Tex. 2019); Sharpe Holdings, Inc. v. U.S. Dep’t of Health & Human Servs., No. 2:12 CV \n92 DDN, 2018 WL 1520031, at *4 (E.D. Mo. Mar. 28, 2018); Reaching Souls Int’l v. Azar, Case \nNo. CIV-13-1092-D, 2018 WL 1352186, at *2 (W.D. Okla. Mar. 15, 2018).  Each court acted \nwhile the two preliminary injunctions against the repeal rules went up and down the appellate \nladder.  See, e.g., Pennsylvania v. President United States, 930 F.3d 543 (3d Cir. 2019); California \n32 \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 124   Filed 01/19/21   Page 33 of 57\nv. U.S. Dep’t of Health & Human Servs., 941 F.3d 410 (9th Cir. 2019); California v. Azar, 911 \nF.3d 558 (9th Cir. 2018).  Indeed, the Supreme Court had the last word: The repeal rules did not \nviolate the APA.  Little Sisters of the Poor, 140 S. Ct. at 2386.  Despite the possibility of an \nappellate court reaching that conclusion all along, not one of the district courts that issued RFRA \ninjunctions against the judicially restored contraceptive mandate discovered a lack of jurisdiction.  \nThe similar posture in those cases reinforces the conclusion that standing is present here. \nAs a last effort, the Defendants contend that HHS has evinced an intent to refrain from \nenforcing  the  challenged  interpretation  of  Section  1557  against  the  Plaintiffs.    They  point \nspecifically to the 2020 Rule’s express incorporation of the Title IX religious exemption, the \nRFRA, and other federal conscience laws.  See 45 C.F.R. § 92.6(b).  To reiterate, though, the \nWhitman-Walker court blocked incorporation of the religious exemption nationwide.  2020 WL \n5232076, at *45.  So HHS cannot defeat standing with a wink and a nod to a regulatory \ninterpretation  that  another  court  has  enjoined.    Nor  does  a  general  commitment  to  follow \npreexisting religious freedom and conscience protections thwart standing.  HHS is always bound \nto implement federal law consistent with the RFRA.  See 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb-3(a) (providing that \nthe RFRA applies to “implementation” of “all Federal law”); Little Sisters of the Poor, 140 S. Ct. \nat 2389 (Alito, J., concurring) (noting that HHS is “obligated to” implement federal law “in a \nmanner that complies with RFRA”).  Simply repeating what the statute already commands does \nnot diminish the possibility that HHS will review the Catholic Plaintiffs’ “individualized and fact \nspecific” RFRA concerns and then decide to pursue enforcement anyway.  81 Fed. Reg. at 31,380.  \nThe other conscience protections enmeshed in the 2020 Rule apply primarily to abortions, offering \n33 \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 124   Filed 01/19/21   Page 34 of 57\nlittle to no protection from the compulsory provision or coverage of gender-transition procedures.8  \nSee Franciscan All., 227 F. Supp. 3d at 683 (concluding that identical conscience laws “do not \nreach religious objections to providing or covering transition-related procedures”).  All told, the \nDefendants’ arguments in opposition to standing fail. \nThe Religious Sisters of Mercy Plaintiffs have standing to challenge HHS’s interpretation \nof Section 1557 that requires them to perform and provide insurance coverage for gender-transition \nprocedures.  So too would the Catholic hospitals and other healthcare entities that count themselves \nas CBA members.  The CBA therefore possesses associational standing to sue on behalf of its \nmembers, including the Diocese, Catholic Charities, and the CMA.  \n2.  Title VII  \nBy the same token, the CBA has associational standing to pursue RFRA claims against the \nEEOC’s interpretation of Title VII.9  Again, the CBA’s organizational purpose is relevant to \nreligious freedom claims pertaining to members’ health plans.  The participation of individual \nmembers remains unnecessary to obtain declaratory and injunctive relief.  Heartland Acad. Cmty. \nChurch, 427 F.3d at 533.  Moreover, individual CBA members like the Diocese and Catholic \nCharities have standing to sue in their own right.   \nAkin to the Section 1557 claims, the three-part injury-in-fact standard articulated in Babbitt \ncontinues to control.  Applying that standard, the Catholic Benefits Association Plaintiffs’ refusal \n \n8 The Church Amendments allow recipients of certain sources of federal funds to abstain from \nperforming sterilization procedures on religious or moral grounds.  42 U.S.C. § 300a-7.  That \nexemption could conceivably apply to some surgeries for gender transitions.  Even so, not all \ngender-transition surgeries result in sterilization, and the Plaintiffs also object to nonsurgical \nservices like counseling and pharmaceutical treatments.  See Doc. Nos. 95, ¶ 35; 97, ¶ 133.   \n9 Title VII exempts employers from paying for health insurance benefits for abortion.  42 U.S.C. \n§ 2000e(k).  The Catholic Benefits Association Plaintiffs do not appear to assert any abortion-\nrelated claims against the EEOC’s interpretation of Title VII.  To the extent they do, such claims \nwould succumb to the same standing problems that defeat the Section 1557 abortion claims. \n34 \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 124   Filed 01/19/21   Page 35 of 57\nto cover gender-transition procedures in their health plans stems from a First Amendment exercise \nof their religious beliefs.  See Ali, 682 F.3d at 709.  And their conduct is not just arguably, but \nquite clearly, proscribed by Title VII.  The EEOC first interpreted Title VII to protect against \ngender-identity discrimination nearly a decade ago.  See Macy, 2012 WL 1435995, at *7.  Then \nin Bostock, the Supreme Court held that the statute must be interpreted that way.  140 S. Ct. at \n1744.  In the 2016 Rule, HHS confirmed that the EEOC would pursue enforcement actions against \nnonhealthcare employers with gender-transition exclusions in their health plans.  81 Fed. Reg. at \n31,432.  CBA members offer health plans with such exclusions and have more than 15 employees, \nbringing them squarely within Title VII’s reach.10  Doc. No. 97, ¶¶ 14, 21, 26. \nThe Defendants primarily dispute standing by asserting a lack of threatened enforcement.  \nThey emphasize that the CBA, despite representing more than a thousand employers over the four-\nyear course of this litigation, has not shown any members subject to past or imminent EEOC \nenforcement action.  But while “enforcement history is relevant . . ., it is not determinative.”  Alexis \nBailly Vineyard, 931 F.3d at 778.  For example, the Eighth Circuit found that a coalition of labor \nunions had standing to challenge two picketing statutes even though the defendant officials \nsubmitted sworn affidavits expressing “no present plan to enforce” them.  United Food & Com. \nWorkers Int’l Union v. IBP, Inc., 857 F.2d 422, 429 (8th Cir. 1988) (internal quotation marks \nomitted).  The court reasoned that “present intentions may not be carried out, and it is not certain \nthat changes in leadership or philosophy might not result in reinstitution of the challenged policy.”  \n \n10 Title VII exempts a religious entity “with respect to the employment of individuals of a particular \nreligion to perform work connected with the carrying on . . . of its activities.”  42 U.S.C. § 2000e-\n1(a).  Most courts deem that exception inapplicable “to a religious organization charged with \ndiscrimination on the basis of sex.”  Starkey v. Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Indianapolis, Inc., \n--- F. Supp. 3d ----, No. 1:19-cv-03153-RLY-TAB, 2020 WL 6434979, at *4 (S.D. Ind. Oct. 21, \n2020) (collecting cases); accord Herx v. Diocese of Ft. Wayne-South Bend Inc., 48 F. Supp. 3d \n1168, 1175-76 (N.D. Ind. 2014) (collecting cases). \n35 \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 124   Filed 01/19/21   Page 36 of 57\nId. at 430 (cleaned up).  Of more recent vintage, the court determined that two beggars had standing \nto challenge an anti-loitering law where the defendant state swore off enforcing the statute against \nthem in open court.  Rodgers v. Bryant, 942 F.3d 451, 455 (8th Cir. 2019).  Citing United Food, \nthe court explained that “in-court assurances do not rule out the possibility that [the state] will \nchange its mind and enforce the law more aggressively in the future.”  Id. \nThis case is stronger than both United Food and Bryant.  The EEOC has never disavowed \nan intent to enforce Title VII’s prohibition on gender-transition exclusions in health plans against \nthe CBA or its members.  At the same time, the EEOC has enforced that very interpretation against \nother employers.  See Doc. No. 97, ¶¶ 157-59.  Because the CBA members’ “course of action is \nwithin the plain text” of Title VII, a credible threat of enforcement persists.  Alexis Bailly \nVineyard, 931 F.3d at 778 (citing Heydinger, 825 F.3d at 917). \nThe CBA members satisfy the causation and redressability elements as well.  The EEOC \nshoulders enforcement responsibility for Title VII, and declaratory and injunctive relief will likely \nredress the threat of enforcement.  See Massachusetts, 549 U.S. at 525.  Accordingly, the CBA \npossesses associational standing for the claims against the EEOC’s interpretation of Title VII.   \n3.  Title IX and Other Federal Laws \nBeyond challenges to Section 1557 and Title VII, the Catholic Benefits Association \nPlaintiffs seek to prospectively bar interpretations of Title IX or any other federal laws that may \ncompel them to perform or cover gender transitions and abortions.  But that is a bridge too far.   \nTo the extent Title IX even applies to those Plaintiffs, the statutory scheme explicitly \nexempts religious organizations.  20 U.S.C. § 1681(a)(3); see also 20 U.S.C. § 1687.  Nor can the \nstatute mandate an entity “to provide or pay for any benefit or service, including the use of \nfacilities, related to an abortion.”  20 U.S.C. § 1688.  So Title IX necessarily cannot prohibit \n36 \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 124   Filed 01/19/21   Page 37 of 57\nreligious entities from refusing to perform or insure gender transitions or abortions.  While the \nCourt acknowledges that Section 1557 incorporates Title IX’s ban on sex discrimination, relief \nfrom Title IX itself is incongruous.  \nAlmost needless to say, the CBA and its members cannot pursue religious freedom claims \nagainst as yet unimagined interpretations of federal laws they do not even identity.  If that were \npossible, anyone could stroll in with a list of religious beliefs and enjoin the government from ever \nadopting laws that might violate them.  Federal courts lack such sweeping authority.  Flast v. \nCohen, 392 U.S. 83, 96 (1968) (citation omitted) (“[T]he oldest and most consistent thread in the \nfederal law of justiciability is that the federal courts will not give advisory opinions.”). \nThe  Catholic  Benefits  Association  Plaintiffs  have  not  shown  a  credible  threat  of \nenforcement for conduct arguably proscribed by Title IX or other unnamed federal laws.  They \ntherefore lack an injury in fact necessary to support standing.  Only their RFRA claims challenging \nthe interpretations of Section 1557 and Title VII may proceed. \nB.  Judicial Comity \nShifting from standing, the Defendants separately contend that considerations of judicial \ncomity prevent the exercise of jurisdiction.  They specifically assert that injunctive relief in these \ncases would directly conflict with the preliminary injunctions entered in Walker and Whitman-\nWalker.  In part, the Court agrees. \nA district court may “in its discretion dismiss a declaratory or injunctive suit if the same \nissue is pending in litigation elsewhere.”  Abbott Lab’ys v. Gardner, 387 U.S. 136, 155 (1967) \n(citations omitted).  “Generally, principles of comity and judicial economy make courts reluctant \nto exercise jurisdiction over claims involving the orders of coordinate courts.”  Zambrana v. \nCalifano, 651 F.2d 842, 844 (2d Cir. 1981) (citations omitted); see also West Gulf Mar. Ass’n v. \n37 \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 124   Filed 01/19/21   Page 38 of 57\nILA Deep Sea Local 24, 751 F.2d 721, 728 (5th Cir. 1985).  “Prudence requires that whenever \npossible, coordinate courts should avoid issuing conflicting orders.”  Feller v. Brock, 802 F.2d \n722, 728 (4th Cir. 1986) (citations omitted).  “When an injunction sought in one federal proceeding \nwould interfere with another federal proceeding, considerations of comity require more than the \nusual measure of restraint, and such injunctions should be granted only in the most unusual cases.”  \nBergh v. Washington, 535 F.2d 505, 507 (9th Cir. 1976) (citation omitted).   \nThe APA claims run headlong into this barrier.  The Religious Sisters of Mercy Plaintiffs \nmove for injunctive relief because, in their view, HHS violated the APA “by misinterpreting \nSection 1557” to prohibit gender-identity discrimination and by “failing to incorporate a statutorily \nmandated religious exemption from Title IX.”  Doc. No. 96, p. 2.  The Walker and Whitman-\nWalker decisions stand in diametric opposition.  In Walker, the court determined that HHS’s \ninterpretation of Section 1557 violated the APA because the 2020 Rule contravened Bostock by \ntaking the position that the statute did not protect against discrimination based on gender identity.  \n2020 WL 4749859, at *9.  The court then partially enjoined repeal of the 2016 Rule and reinstated \nthe definition of “on the basis of sex” to encompass “gender identity” and “sex stereotyping.”  Id. \nat *10.  Two weeks later, the Whitman-Walker court found similar APA violations and halted \nrepeal of the “sex stereotyping” definition and incorporation of the Title IX religious exemption.  \n2020 WL 6363970, at *45.  Both orders apply nationwide.  See id. at *6, *44.    \nImagine now if this Court were to sign off on the injunctive relief proposed here.  Where \nthe Walker and Whitman-Walker courts ordered that HHS must interpret Section 1557 to protect \nagainst discrimination based on gender identity, this Court would order that HHS cannot do so.  \nAnd where the Whitman-Walker court ordered that HHS cannot implement the Title IX religious \nexemption, this Court would order that HHS must do so.  Irreconcilable becomes the only \n38 \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 124   Filed 01/19/21   Page 39 of 57\nappropriate word.  Solidifying that notion, “[w]here different outcomes would place the defendant \nunder inconsistent legal duties, the case for the second court’s not going into conflict with the first \nis particularly strong.”  Colby v. J.C. Penney Co., Inc., 811 F.2d 1119, 1124 (7th Cir. 1987).  If \nimposed, the Plaintiffs’ requested injunctive relief would force HHS to choose between disparate \norders from “courts of coordinate jurisdiction and equal rank.”  West Gulf Mar. Ass’n, 751 F.2d \nat 728.  That outcome is untenable.    \nIn defense, the Plaintiffs try to paint comity among federal district courts as a doctrine \nnarrowly applicable to overlapping suits presenting identical issues between the same parties.  See \nMissouri ex rel. Nixon v. Prudential Health Care Plan, Inc., 259 F.3d 949, 954 (8th Cir. 2001) \n(“Plaintiffs may not pursue multiple federal suits against the same party involving the same \ncontroversy at the same time.”).  But the principle extends more broadly.  See Hartford Fire Ins. \nCo. v. California, 509 U.S. 764, 817 (1993) (Scalia, J., dissenting) (discussing “the comity of \ncourts, whereby judges decline to exercise jurisdiction over matters more appropriately adjudged \nelsewhere”); Feller, 802 F.2d at 728 (declaring “comity” a misnomer in a similar context, but \nexplaining that “whatever its label, there is an underlying policy of judicial administration which \ncounsels against the creation of conflicts such as the one at bar”); Spencer E. Amdur & David \nHausman, Nationwide Injunctions and Nationwide Harm, 131 Harv. L. Rev. 49, 52 n.22 (2017) \n(noting  that  “the  principle  of  comity  .  .  .  normally  counsels  against  issuing  a  conflicting \ninjunction”).  Invoking judicial comity, several district courts have either vacated or abstained \nfrom issuing injunctions that posed conflicts with orders of coordinate courts.  See California ex \nrel. Lockyer v. U.S. Dep’t of Agric., 710 F. Supp. 2d 916, 921-23 (N.D. Cal. 2008); Fund for \nAnimals v. Norton, 323 F. Supp. 2d 7, 10-11 (D.D.C. 2004); Exxon Corp. v. U.S. Dep’t of Energy, \n39 \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 124   Filed 01/19/21   Page 40 of 57\n594 F. Supp. 84, 89-90 (D. Del. 1984); Common Cause v. Jud. Ethics Comm., 473 F. Supp. 1251, \n1253-54 (D.D.C. 1979).     \nEndorsing the Religious Sisters of Mercy Plaintiffs’ proposed APA relief would inevitably \nconflict with decisions of other district courts and simultaneously subject HHS to inconsistent legal \nobligations.  The Court believes that route is improper and unwise.  In the exercise of its discretion, \nthe Court declines to adjudicate the APA claims. \nNevertheless, the RFRA and Spending Clause claims do not evoke the same concerns.  The \nWalker and Whitman-Walker preliminary injunction orders dealt solely with APA challenges to \nHHS’s interpretation of Section 1557.  What the Plaintiffs ask for now are essentially exceptions \nto the agency’s interpretation in the aftermath of those decisions.  The Catholic Plaintiffs insist \nthat HHS’s prevailing interpretation should not apply to them for religious freedom reasons.  North \nDakota professes entitlement to an exemption on state sovereignty grounds.  Ordering relief under \neither theory would run parallel, rather than perpendicular, to the other district court decisions.  \nSee Whitman-Walker, 2020 WL 5232076, at *42 (explaining that “nothing in this Court’s Order \naffects the application of RFRA”); see also Christian Emps. All., 2019 WL 2130142, at *5-6 \n(entering RFRA injunction against contraceptive mandate following APA injunctions blocking \nrepeal rules).  Nor would HHS end up saddled with incompatible orders from coordinate courts.  \nThe agency would remain subject to the Walker and Whitman-Walker courts’ directives regarding \nthe interpretation of Section 1557, while incurring distinct obligations to avoid applying that \ninterpretation to the Plaintiffs due to countermanding constitutional and statutory authority.  Thus, \njudicial comity is no bar to the RFRA and Spending Clause claims. \n \n \n40 \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 124   Filed 01/19/21   Page 41 of 57\nC.  Ripeness and Mootness \nIn a final attempt to defeat jurisdiction, the Defendants raise ripeness and mootness hurdles.  \nRipeness tests “the fitness of the issues for judicial resolution” and “the hardship to the parties of \nwithholding court consideration.”  Pac. Gas & Elec. Co. v. State Energy Res. Conservation & Dev. \nComm’n, 461 U.S. 190, 201 (1983) (citation omitted).  The party seeking judicial review “must \nnecessarily  satisfy  both  prongs  to  at  least  a  minimal  degree.”    Neb.  Pub.  Power  Dist.  v. \nMidAmerican Energy Co., 234 F.3d 1032, 1039 (8th Cir. 2000).  “A claim is not ripe for \nadjudication if it rests upon contingent future events that may not occur as anticipated, or indeed \nmay not occur at all.”  Texas v. United States, 523 U.S. 296, 300 (1998) (citations and internal \nquotation marks omitted).     \nThe Plaintiffs’ surviving claims against the interpretations of Section 1557 and Title VII \nsatisfy both ripeness prongs.  “Fitness rests primarily on whether a case would benefit from further \nfactual development.”  City of Kennett v. EPA, 887 F.3d 424, 433 (8th Cir. 2018) (citation \nomitted).  These cases present “purely legal questions”—whether the challenged interpretations of \nfederal  law  violate  the  RFRA  and  the  Spending  Clause—and  need  no  additional  factual \ndevelopment.   Iowa League of Cities, 711  F.3d at  867.    Although HHS  has  appealed  the \npreliminary injunctions against the 2020 Rule, the “chance of a change” is not enough to render \nclaims based on current law unfit for review.  City of Kennett, 887 F.3d at 434.  Meanwhile, “[t]he \nhardship prong asks whether delayed review ‘inflicts significant practical harm’ on the plaintiffs.”  \nParrish v. Dayton, 761 F.3d 873, 875 (8th Cir. 2014) (quoting Ohio Forestry Ass’n, Inc. v. Sierra \nClub, 523 U.S. 726, 733 (1998)).  Practical harm is manifest here because the Plaintiffs must either \nalter their policies for providing and covering gender-transition procedures (which the Catholic \nPlaintiffs assert will violate their religious beliefs and North Dakota its sovereign interests) or risk \n41 \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 124   Filed 01/19/21   Page 42 of 57\nthe loss of critical federal healthcare funding along with potential civil and criminal penalties.  \nTherefore, these cases are sufficiently ripe for review. \nResisting ripeness for the Title VII claims in particular, the Defendants cite to Standing \nRock Housing Authority v. EEOC, 585 F. Supp. 2d 1112 (D.N.D. 2008).  There, another court in \nthis district dismissed as unripe a declaratory judgment suit that sought to nullify an EEOC \nadministrative subpoena regarding sexual harassment allegations.  585 F. Supp. 2d at 1121.  The \ncourt found a lack of final agency action11 because “mere issuance of an administrative subpoena \nfixes no obligations nor imposes any legal liability.”  Id. at 1120.  This case is different.  Through \nthe 2016 Rule, the EEOC staked out the position that Title VII forbids employers to categorically \nexclude gender-transition procedures from their health plans.  81 Fed. Reg. at 31,432.  Its stance \nhas not wavered, as evidenced by multiple enforcement actions brought against employers since \nthen.  See Doc. No. 97, ¶¶ 157-59.  The EEOC’s position thus represents “the consummation of \nthe agency’s decisionmaking process” and determines “rights or obligations” of the CBA and its \nmembers as covered employers.  U.S. Army Corps of Eng’rs v. Hawkes Co., Inc., 587 U.S. ___, \n136 S. Ct. 1807, 1813 (2016) (quoting Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 177-78 (1997)).  Standing \nRock does not dictate dismissal of the Title VII claims as unripe.  \nMootness occurs when “changed circumstances already provide the requested relief and \neliminate the need for court action.”  McCarthy v. Ozark Sch. Dist., 359 F.3d 1029, 1035 (8th Cir. \n2004).  Courts recurrently describe mootness as “the doctrine of standing set in a time frame: The \nrequisite personal interest that must exist at the commencement of the litigation (standing) must \n \n11 The APA circumscribes judicial review in part to “final agency action for which there is no other \nadequate remedy in a court.”  5 U.S.C. § 704.  That requirement informs the ripeness inquiry for \nchallenges to decisions of administrative agencies.  See Lane v. U.S. Dep’t of Agric., 187 F.3d \n793, 795 (8th Cir. 1999).    \n42 \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 124   Filed 01/19/21   Page 43 of 57\ncontinue throughout its existence (mootness).”  Arizonans for Official English v. Arizona, 520 \nU.S. 43, 68 n.22 (1997) (citation omitted).   \nSimply put, neither case is moot because nothing has changed since the Plaintiffs submitted \ntheir amended complaints.  They remain subject to the interpretations of Section 1557 and Title \nVII that spurred them to move for relief.  The Plaintiffs possess standing to pursue some of their \nclaims, and the challenged legal regime has stayed constant since this litigation recommenced.  \nThese cases are not moot as a result. \nIn sum, the Court will exercise jurisdiction over the Plaintiffs’ RFRA and Spending Clause \nclaims challenging the interpretations of Section 1557 and Title VII that compel them to perform \nand provide insurance coverage for gender transitions.  The abortion-related claims, the APA \nclaims, and the claims challenging Title IX and other unidentified federal laws call for dismissal. \nIII.  SUMMARY JUDGMENT \nWith  jurisdiction  resolved,  the  Court  addresses  the  merits.    Summary  judgment  is \nappropriate “if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the \nmovant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a); see also Celotex Corp. \nv. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322 (1986).  “An issue is ‘genuine’ if the evidence is sufficient to persuade \na reasonable jury to return a verdict for the nonmoving party.”  Schilf v. Eli Lilly & Co., 687 F.3d \n947, 948 (8th Cir. 2012) (citing Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986)).  “A \nfact is material if it ‘might affect the outcome of the suit.’”  Dick v. Dickinson State Univ., 826 \nF.3d 1054, 1061 (8th Cir. 2016) (quoting Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248).  Courts view the facts and \ndraw all reasonable inferences most favorably to the nonmoving party.  TCF Nat’l Bank v. Mkt. \nIntel., Inc., 812 F.3d 701, 707 (8th Cir. 2016). \n \n43 \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 124   Filed 01/19/21   Page 44 of 57\n  A.  Religious Freedom Restoration Act \nCongress enacted the RFRA “to provide very broad protection for religious liberty.”  \nBurwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., 573 U.S. 682, 693 (2014).  The RFRA forbids government \nto “substantially burden a person’s exercise of religion” unless the burden (1) “is in furtherance of \na compelling governmental interest” and (2) “is the least restrictive means of furthering that \ncompelling interest.”  42 U.S.C. § 2000bb-1(b).  “A person whose religious practices are burdened \nin violation of RFRA ‘may assert that violation as a claim or defense in a judicial proceeding and \nobtain appropriate relief.’”  Gonzales v. O Centro Espirita Beneficente Uniao do Vegetal, 546 U.S. \n418, 424 (2006) (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb-1(c)).  If a substantial burden exists, then the \ngovernment assumes the obligation to meet the “exceptionally demanding” strict scrutiny standard.  \nHobby Lobby, 573 U.S. at 728.  \n  1.  Substantial Burden \n  The RFRA initially queries whether the challenged implementations of Section 1557 and \nTitle VII impose a substantial burden on the Catholic Plaintiffs’ exercise of religion.  The analysis \nposes two different questions.  “First, would non-compliance have substantial adverse practical \nconsequences?”  Little Sisters of the Poor, 140 S. Ct. at 2389 (Alito, J., concurring) (citing Hobby \nLobby, 573 U.S. at 720-23).  “Second, would compliance cause the objecting party to violate its \nreligious beliefs, as it sincerely understands them?”  Id. (emphasis omitted) (citing Hobby Lobby, \n573 U.S. at 723-26).  \n  In  this  instance,  adverse  practical  consequences  abound.    Under  the  prevailing \ninterpretations of Section 1557 and Title VII, refusal to perform or cover gender-transition \nprocedures would result in the Catholic Plaintiffs losing millions of dollars in federal healthcare \nfunding  and  incurring  civil  and  criminal  liability.    An  “imposition  of  significant  monetary \n44 \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 124   Filed 01/19/21   Page 45 of 57\npenalties” indisputably qualifies as a substantial burden.  Sharpe Holdings, 801 F.3d at 937; see \nalso Priests for Life v. U.S. Dep’t of Health & Human Servs., 808 F.3d 1, 16 n.3 (D.C. Cir. 2015) \n(Kavanaugh, J., dissenting from denial of reh’g en banc) (“There has never been a question that \nsuch a direct penalty imposes a substantial burden on the exercise of religion”). \n  Just as clearly, compliance with the challenged laws would violate the Catholic Plaintiffs’ \nreligious beliefs as they sincerely understand them.  The RFRA broadly defines “exercise of \nreligion” as “any exercise of religion, whether or not compelled by, or central to, a system of \nreligious belief.”  42 U.S.C. §§ 2000bb-2, 2000cc-5(7)(A).  “[T]he ‘exercise of religion’ involves \n‘not only belief and profession but the performance of (or abstention from) physical acts.’”  Hobby \nLobby, 573 U.S. at 710 (quoting Emp. Div., Dep’t of Human Res. of Or. v. Smith, 494 U.S. 872, \n877 (1990)).  In meticulous detail, the Catholic Plaintiffs have explained that their religious beliefs \nregarding human sexuality and procreation prevent them from facilitating gender transitions \nthrough either medical services or insurance coverage.  See Doc. Nos. 95, ¶¶ 98-152; 98, ¶¶ 70-\n100, 220-241.  The Defendants in no way dispute the sincerity of those beliefs.  Doc. No. 113, p. \n2.  Nor is it this Court’s domain to question them.  Hernandez v. Comm’r, 490 U.S. 680, 699 \n(1989) (“It is not within the judicial ken to question the centrality of particular beliefs or practices \nto a faith, or the validity of particular litigants’ interpretations of those creeds.”).  Because the \ninterpretations of Section 1557 and Title VII threaten to penalize the Catholic Plaintiffs for \nadhering to their beliefs, a substantial burden weighs on the exercise of religion.   \n  2.  Compelling Interest \n  With a substantial burden present, the government must demonstrate that the challenged \nimplementations of federal law advance “interests of the highest order.”  Church of the Lukumi \nBabalu Aye, Inc. v. City of Hialeah, 508 U.S. 520, 546 (1993) (citations and internal quotation \n45 \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 124   Filed 01/19/21   Page 46 of 57\nmarks omitted).  The Defendants never attempt to make that showing here.  In the 2020 Rule, HHS \nconceded to lacking a “compelling interest in forcing the provision, or coverage, of these medically \ncontroversial [gender-transition] services by covered entities.”  85 Fed. Reg. at 37,188. \nThat aside, even the interests advanced prior to the 2020 Rule likely fall short.  The 2016 \nRule,  for  example,  proffered  a  compelling  interest  in  ensuring  nondiscriminatory  access  to \nhealthcare.  81 Fed. Reg. at 31,380.  Similarly, the EEOC has previously asserted that Title VII \nfurthers a “compelling interest in combating discrimination in the workforce.”  EEOC v. R.G. & \nG.R. Harris Funeral Homes, Inc., 884 F.3d 560, 591 (6th Cir. 2018), aff’d, 140 S. Ct. 1731 (2020).  \nBut the Supreme Court has instructed to look “beyond broadly formulated interests.”  O Centro, \n546 U.S. at 431.  Rather, courts must “scrutinize the asserted harm of granting specific exemptions \nto particular religious claimants and to look to the marginal interest in enforcing the challenged \ngovernment action in that particular context.”  Holt v. Hobbs, 574 U.S. 352, 363 (2015) (cleaned \nup).  Neither HHS nor the EEOC has articulated how granting specific exemptions for the Catholic \nPlaintiffs will harm the asserted interests in preventing discrimination.   \nAlso cutting against the Defendants, “a law cannot be regarded as protecting an interest of \nthe  highest  order  .  .  .  when  it  leaves  appreciable  damage  to  that  supposedly  vital  interest \nunprohibited.”  281 Care Comm. v. Arneson, 766 F.3d 774, 787 (8th Cir. 2014) (cleaned up).  A \nmandate for entities subject to Section 1557 and Title VII to perform and cover gender-transition \nprocedures  still  leaves gaps, including  in  the government’s own healthcare programs.    See \nFranciscan All., 227 F. Supp. 3d at 692-93.  In short, the Court harbors serious doubts that a \ncompelling interest exists.  This issue need not be resolved, however, because the Defendants fail \nto meet the rigors of the least-restrictive-means test.  See Hobby Lobby, 573 U.S. at 728.   \n \n46 \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 124   Filed 01/19/21   Page 47 of 57\n  3.  Least Restrictive Means \n  To satisfy the least-restrictive-means test, the government must “come forward with \nevidence” to show that its policies “are the only feasible means . . . to achieve its compelling \ninterest.”  Sharpe Holdings, 801 F.3d at 943.  “If a less restrictive means is available for the \nGovernment to achieve its goals, the Government must use it.”  Holt, 574 U.S. at 365 (cleaned up).  \nIn the RFRA context, “a regulation may constitute the least restrictive means of furthering the \ngovernment’s compelling interests if ‘no alternative forms of regulation’ would accomplish those \ninterests without infringing on a claimant’s religious-exercise rights.  Sharpe Holdings, 801 F.3d \nat 943 (quoting Sherbert v. Verner, 374 U.S. 398, 407 (1963)).  \n  Here, the Defendants possess many less restrictive alternatives beyond forcing the Catholic \nPlaintiffs to perform and cover gender-transition procedures in violation of their religious beliefs.  \nIf the aim is to expand financial support, then “[t]he most straightforward way of doing this would \nbe for the Government to assume the cost of providing” gender-transition procedures for those \n“unable to obtain them under their health-insurance policies due to their employers’ religious \nobjections.”   Hobby Lobby, 573 U.S. at 728.  Other options include providing “subsidies, \nreimbursements, tax credits, or tax deductions to employees” or paying for services “at community \nhealth centers, public clinics, and hospitals with income-based support.”  Sharpe Holdings, 801 \nF.3d at 945.  ACA exchanges offer yet another viable alternative, whereby “the government could \ntreat employees whose employers do not provide complete coverage for religious reasons the same \nas it does employees whose employers provide no coverage at all.”  Id. (citations and internal \nquotations  marks  omitted);  see  also  81  Fed.  Reg.  at  31,428  (noting  that  nondiscrimination \nrequirements apply to plans offered through ACA exchanges).  And if broadening access to \ngender-transition procedures themselves is the goal, then “[t]he government could . . . assist \n47 \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 124   Filed 01/19/21   Page 48 of 57\ntransgender individuals in finding and paying for transition procedures available from the growing \nnumber of healthcare providers who offer and specialize in those services.”  Franciscan All., 227 \nF. Supp. 3d at 693; see also Doc. No. 120-3 (listing clinics that specialize in healthcare for \ntransgender individuals). \nIn response, the Defendants have “not shown that these alternatives are infeasible.”  Sharpe \nHoldings, 801 F.3d at 945.  They therefore fail to demonstrate that their policies use the least \nrestrictive means to burden the Catholic Plaintiffs’ exercise of religion.  As applied, the challenged \ninterpretations of Section 1557 and Title VII violate the RFRA.  Summary judgment is appropriate \nas a consequence. \n  B.  Spending Clause \nThe Spending Clause empowers Congress “to pay the Debts and provide for the . . . general \nWelfare of the United States.”  U.S. Const. Art. I, § 8, cl. 1.  Inherent in the spending power is “the \nauthority to impose limits on the use of such funds to ensure they are used in the manner Congress \nintends.”  Agency for Int’l Dev. v. All. for Open Soc’y Int’l, 570 U.S. 205, 213 (2013) (citing Rust \nv. Sullivan, 500 U.S. 173, 195 n.4 (1991)).  Though broad, that authority comes with five restraints \nwhen conditioning a state’s receipt of federal funds:  \n(1) the legislation must be in pursuit of the general welfare, (2) conditions on the \nstate’s receipt of federal funds must be set out unambiguously so that the state’s \nparticipation is the result of a knowing and informed choice, (3) conditions on \nfederal funds must be related to the federal interest in particular national projects \nor  programs,  (4)  conditions  must  not  be  prohibited  by  other  constitutional \nprovisions, and finally, (5) the circumstances must not be so coercive that “pressure \nturns into compulsion.” \n \nVan Whye v. Reisch, 581 F.3d 639, 649-50 (8th Cir. 2009) (citing South Dakota v. Dole, 483 U.S. \n203, 207-11 (1987)).   \n48 \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 124   Filed 01/19/21   Page 49 of 57\nFrom North Dakota’s perspective, Section 1557 transgresses two of those boundaries.  \nFirst, North Dakota contends that Congress failed to unambiguously inform the states that they \nmust perform and provide insurance coverage for gender-transition procedures as a condition of \ncontinued federal healthcare funding.  Second, the state assails that condition as unconstitutionally \ncoercive.  Neither theory is persuasive. \n  1.  Unambiguous Notice \nThe Supreme Court often characterizes Spending Clause legislation as “much in the nature \nof a contract.”  Pennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. v. Halderman, 451 U.S. 1, 17 (1981).  Legitimate \nexercise of the spending power “thus rests on whether the State voluntarily and knowingly accepts \nthe terms of the ‘contract.’”  Id.  “Unlike normal contractual undertakings, federal grant programs \noriginate in and remain governed by statutory provisions expressing the judgment of Congress \nconcerning desirable public policy.”  Bennett v. Ky. Dep’t of Educ., 470 U.S. 656, 669 (1985).  \nNorth Dakota asserts that performing and covering gender transitions was not part of the \ndeal when first accepting Medicaid funding in 1965.  But the inquiry properly focuses on when \nthe objectionable condition took effect, not when Congress originally enacted the  spending \nprogram.12  See South Dakota v. Dole, 483 U.S. 203, 208 (1987) (finding unambiguous notice \nsatisfied based on 1984 amendments to Federal Aid Highway Act rather than original statute); \nBennett, 470 U.S. at 670 (noting that “the legal requirements in place when the grants were made” \nunder 1970 amendments to Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act controlled \nSpending Clause analysis).  The correct question is accordingly whether Section 1557, as enacted \nin 2010, “furnishes clear notice regarding the liability at issue.”  Osseo Area Schs., Indep. Sch. \n \n12 In any event, North Dakota voluntarily joined the ACA’s Medicaid expansion.  See Medicaid \nExpansion, N.D. Dep’t of Human Servs., http://www.nd.gov/dhs/medicaidexpansion/ (last visited \nJan. 19, 2021).  The state no doubt acquiesced to new funding conditions when doing so. \n49 \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 124   Filed 01/19/21   Page 50 of 57\nDist. No. 279 v. M.N.B. ex rel. J.B., 970 F.3d 917, 922 (8th Cir. 2020) (quoting Arlington Cent. \nSch. Dist. Bd. of Educ. v. Murphy, 548 U.S. 291, 296 (2006)). \nThe answer is yes.  Section 1557 unambiguously informed North Dakota that liability could \nattach from engaging in sex discrimination when using federal healthcare funds.  See 42 U.S.C. § \n18116(a); 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a).  By March 2010, a host of federal courts had determined that laws \nbanning sex discrimination equally barred discrimination based on gender identity.  See Glenn v. \nBrumby, 663 F.3d 1312, 1317-18 (11th Cir. 2011) (collecting cases, all of which predate the ACA); \nsee also Tovar v. Essentia Health, 342 F. Supp. 3d 947, 953 (D. Minn. 2018) (rejecting Spending \nClause  claim  because  pre-ACA  decisions  put  defendants  “on  notice  that  Section  1557’s \nnondiscrimination requirements encompassed gender-identity discrimination”); Flack v. Wis. \nDep’t of Health Servs., 328 F. Supp. 3d 931, 950 (W.D. Wisc. 2018) (rejecting Spending Clause \nclaim against Section 1557 because when “the Affordable Care Act was enacted, federal courts \nhad  already  interpreted  prohibitions  on  sex  discrimination  to  cover  adverse  treatment  of \ntransgender people”).  Harkening back to the contract analogy, dissension about the meaning of a \nterm does not render an agreement ambiguous.  Chavis Van & Storage of Myrtle Beach, Inc. v. \nUnited Van Lines, LLC, 784 F.3d 1183, 1188 (8th Cir. 2015).  North Dakota possessed sufficient \nnotice that Section 1557 could prohibit discrimination based on gender identity, thereby affording \nan adequate opportunity to decide whether to continue accepting federal healthcare dollars.  \nFurthermore, even if 1965 were the right starting point, Congress expressly reserved “[t]he \nright to alter, amend or repeal any provision” of the Medicaid program from day one.  42 U.S.C. \n§ 1304.  The states have also consented—for more than 30 years—to amend their Medicaid plans \n“whenever necessary to reflect . . . [c]hanges in Federal law, regulations, policy interpretations, or \ncourt decisions.”  42 C.F.R. § 430.12(c)(1)(i); Medicaid Program; State Plans and Grants to States, \n50 \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 124   Filed 01/19/21   Page 51 of 57\n53 Fed. Reg. 36,569, 36,572 (Sept. 21, 1988).  Mindful of those provisions, the Supreme Court \ncommented  that  the  states  “might  reasonably  assume  that  Congress  was  entitled  to  make \nadjustments to the Medicaid program as it developed.”  Nat’l Fed’n of Indep. Bus., 567 U.S. at \n583.  Congress has done so numerous times since Medicaid’s genesis, repeatedly conditioning the \nreceipt of funds on compliance with new amendments.  See id.  Lack of notice to the states proved \ninsurmountable in a single instance.  That happened when Congress attempted “a shift in kind, not \nmerely  degree”  by  conditioning  all  existing  Medicaid  funding  on  the  states  adopting  what \namounted to “an element of a comprehensive national plan to provide universal health insurance \ncoverage.”  Id.  Surely, then, prohibiting the states from engaging in sex discrimination when \nadministering Medicaid is a shift in degree, not in kind.   \nLastly, North Dakota’s reliance on Smith v. Rasmussen, 249 F.3d 755 (8th Cir. 2001), is \nmisplaced.  In that case, the Eighth Circuit held that a state’s “prohibition on funding of sex \nreassignment surgery is both reasonable and consistent with the Medicaid Act.”  249 F.3d at 761.  \nSmith is wholly silent, however, on the federal government’s ability to enact new laws and \nregulations requiring states to cover gender-transition procedures.  North Dakota is left exposed to \nthat outcome because “participating States are to comply with requirements imposed by the \n[Medicaid] Act and by the Secretary of Health and Human Services.”  Atkins v. Rivera, 477 U.S. \n154, 157 (1986) (citations omitted).  Perceived lack of unambiguous notice does not entitle North \nDakota to summary judgment. \n  2.  Coercion \n  The Spending Clause’s coercion backstop is closely linked to the Tenth Amendment \nconcept that the federal government may not commandeer the states “to enact or administer a \nfederal regulatory program.”  New York v. United States, 505 U.S. 144, 188 (1992); see also Nat’l \n51 \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 124   Filed 01/19/21   Page 52 of 57\nFed’n of Indep. Bus., 567 U.S. at 577-78 (discussing Tenth Amendment limitations on the \nspending power).  To that end, conditions on federal funds cannot “be so coercive as to pass the \npoint at which ‘pressure turns into compulsion.’”  Dole, 483 U.S. at 211 (quoting Steward Machine \nCo. v. Davis, 301 U.S. 548, 590 (1937)).   \nNorth Dakota contends that Section 1557 improperly compels the provision and coverage \nof gender-transition procedures by threatening to withhold all federal healthcare funding.  The \nstate accepts HHS funds for two distinct purposes: to provide healthcare services and to administer \na Medicaid program.  Doc. Nos. 95, ¶ 12; 96-8, ¶ 4.  In these circumstances, conditions on funds \nfor either purpose do not implicate the coercion doctrine. \nInsofar as North Dakota provides federally funded healthcare services, Spending Clause \nprotection is precluded because HHS regulates private entities in an identical manner.  “The \nanticommandeering doctrine does not apply when Congress evenhandedly regulates an activity in \nwhich both States and private actors engage.”  Murphy v. Nat’l Collegiate Athletic Ass’n, 584 \nU.S. ___, 138 S. Ct. 1461, 1478 (2018); see also Reno v. Condon, 528 U.S. 141, 150-51 (2000); \nSouth Carolina v. Baker, 485 U.S. 505, 514-15 (1988); Garcia v. San Antonio Metro. Transit \nAuth., 469 U.S. 528, 554-56 (1985).  North Dakota offers healthcare services alongside private \nentities, meaning the state must accept the universally applicable regulations that follow. \nAdministering a Medicaid program, on the other hand, is unique to the states.  To be sure, \nconstitutionally impermissible coercion may occur when “conditions take the form of threats to \nterminate other significant independent grants . . . as a means of pressuring the States to accept \npolicy changes.”  Nat’l Fed’n of Indep. Bus., 567 U.S. at 580 (emphasis added).  But the coercion \ndoctrine is inapposite where Congress “condition[s] the receipt of funds on the States’ complying \nwith restrictions on the use of those funds, because that is the means by which Congress ensures \n52 \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 124   Filed 01/19/21   Page 53 of 57\nthat the funds are spent according to its view of the ‘general Welfare.’”  Id. (emphasis added); see \nalso Dole, 483 U.S. at 210 (“We have also held that a perceived Tenth Amendment limitation on \ncongressional regulation of state affairs did not concomitantly limit the range of conditions \nlegitimately placed on federal grants.”); Oklahoma v. U.S. Civ. Serv. Comm’n, 330 U.S. 127, 143 \n(1947) (explaining that the federal government “does have the power to fix the terms upon which \nits money allotments to states shall be disbursed”).  Section 1557 is a direct restriction on how \nNorth Dakota may utilize federal healthcare funding, not an indirect inducement to enact new \npolicies at congressional behest.  Because Congress retains the prerogative to impose conditions \non the use of federal funds, North Dakota’s coercion argument falls flat.  Summary judgment on \nthe Spending Clause claims is therefore unwarranted.13   \nIV.  INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n  Rule 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure authorizes district courts to grant injunctive \nrelief.  When considering a motion for permanent injunction, four factors control: “(1) the threat \nof irreparable harm to the movant; (2) the state of balance between this harm and the injury that \ngranting the injunction will inflict on other parties; (3) whether the movant proves actual success \non the merits; and (4) the public interest.”  Forest Park II v. Hadley, 336 F.3d 724, 731 (8th Cir. \n2003) (citing Bank One, Utah v. Guttau, 190 F.3d 844, 847 (8th Cir. 1999)).  While no one factor \nis dispositive, success on the merits is most important.  Brady v. Nat’l Football League, 640 F.3d \n785, 789 (8th Cir. 2011).  The balance of harms and public interest factors merge when the \ngovernment is the opposing party.  Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 435 (2009).  The burden to \n \n13 For the same reasons, North Dakota is unlikely to succeed on the merits of its Spending Clause \nclaims.  A preliminary injunction is unavailable as a result.  See Planned Parenthood Minn., N.D., \nS.D. v. Rounds, 530 F.3d 724, 732-33 (8th Cir. 2008) (en banc) (holding that a plaintiff challenging \ngovernment policy must make “a threshold showing that it is likely to prevail on the merits” to \nsecure a preliminary injunction). \n53 \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 124   Filed 01/19/21   Page 54 of 57\ndemonstrate the necessity of injunctive relief rests with the movant.  General Motors Corp. v. \nHarry Brown’s, LLC, 563 F.3d 312, 316 (8th Cir. 2009).  \n  The Catholic Plaintiffs have demonstrated an entitlement to permanent injunctive relief.  \nAn RFRA violation is comparable to the deprivation of a First Amendment right.  See Hobby \nLobby Stores, Inc. v. Sebelius, 723 F.3d 1114, 1146 (10th Cir. 2013), aff’d, 573 U.S. 682 (2015); \ncf. Opulent Life Church v. City of Holly Springs, 697 F.3d 279, 298 (5th Cir. 2012).  So with \nactual success on the RFRA claims established, “the other requirements for obtaining a[n] . . . \ninjunction are generally deemed to have been satisfied.”  Minn. Citizens Concerned for Life, Inc. \nv. Swanson, 692 F.3d 864, 870 (8th Cir. 2012) (en banc) (citation omitted).    \nTouching briefly on the remaining factors, intrusion upon the Catholic Plaintiffs’ exercise \nof religion is sufficient to show irreparable harm.  See Child Evangelism Fellowship of Minn. v. \nMinneapolis Special Sch. Dist. No. 1., 690 F.3d 996, 1000 (8th Cir. 2012) (deeming meritorious \nFirst Amendment claim “likely enough, standing alone, to establish irreparable harm”).  The \nbalance of harms tilts decisively in their favor too.  Absent an injunction, they will either be “forced \nto violate their sincerely held religious beliefs” by performing and covering gender-transition \nprocedures “or to incur severe monetary penalties for refusing to comply.”  Sharpe Holdings, 801 \nF.3d at 945.  An injunction will also advance the public interest because the protection of \nconstitutional rights is “always in the public interest.”  Carson v. Simon, 978 F.3d 1051, 1061 (8th \nCir. 2020) (citation omitted).  Finally, injunctive relief should extend to the Catholic Plaintiffs’ \npresent and future members to avoid “continuous litigation and . . . a waste of judicial resources.”  \nChristian Emps. All., 2019 WL 2130142, at *5.  Having weighed the pertinent factors, the Court \nwill permanently enjoin the Defendants from enforcing the successfully challenged interpretations \nof federal law against the Catholic Plaintiffs. \n54 \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 124   Filed 01/19/21   Page 55 of 57\nV.  CONCLUSION \n  The Court has reviewed the record, the parties’ filings, and the relevant legal authority.  \nFor the reasons above, the Defendants’ motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction (Doc. No. 112) \nis GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART.  The abortion-related claims, the APA claims, \nand the claims challenging Title IX and other unidentified federal laws are hereby DISMISSED \nWITHOUT PREJUDICE.  The Plaintiffs’ motions for partial summary judgment and injunctive \nrelief (Doc. Nos. 96, 98) are GRANTED as to the RFRA claims challenging the interpretations of \nSection 1557 and Title VII that require the Catholic Plaintiffs to perform and provide insurance \ncoverage for gender-transition procedures and DENIED in all other respects.   \nThe Court DECLARES that HHS’s interpretation of Section 1557  that requires the \nCatholic Plaintiffs to perform and provide insurance coverage for gender-transition procedures14 \nviolates their sincerely held religious beliefs without satisfying strict scrutiny under the RFRA.  \nAccordingly, the Court PERMANENTLY ENJOINS AND RESTRAINS HHS, Secretary Azar, \ntheir divisions, bureaus, agents, officers, commissioners, employees, and anyone acting in concert \nor participation with them, including their successors in office, from interpreting or enforcing \nSection 1557 of the ACA, 42 U.S.C. § 18116(a), or any implementing regulations thereto against \nthe Catholic Plaintiffs in a manner that would require them to perform or provide insurance \ncoverage for gender-transition  procedures,  including  by denying  federal  financial assistance \nbecause of their failure to perform or provide insurance coverage for such procedures or by \notherwise pursuing, charging, or assessing any penalties, fines, assessments, investigations, or \nother enforcement actions. \n \n14 As used in this order, the term “gender-transition procedures” includes surgery, counseling, \nprovision of pharmaceuticals, or other treatments sought in furtherance of a gender transition. \n55 \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 124   Filed 01/19/21   Page 56 of 57\nThe Court further DECLARES that the EEOC’s interpretation of Title VII that requires \nthe CBA and its members to provide insurance coverage for gender-transition procedures violates \ntheir  sincerely  held  religious  beliefs  without  satisfying  strict  scrutiny  under  the  RFRA.  \nAccordingly, the Court PERMANENTLY ENJOINS AND RESTRAINS the EEOC, Chair \nDhillon, their divisions, bureaus, agents, officers, commissioners, employees, and anyone acting \nin concert or participation with them, including their successors in office, from interpreting or \nenforcing Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e et seq., or any implementing \nregulations thereto against the CBA and its members in a manner that would require them to \nprovide  insurance  coverage  for  gender-transition  procedures,  including  by  denying  federal \nfinancial assistance because of their failure to provide insurance coverage for such procedures or \nby otherwise pursuing, charging, or assessing any penalties, fines, assessments, investigations, or \nother enforcement actions.  \nThe relief provided in this order shall be restricted to the Catholic Plaintiffs, their present \nand future members, anyone acting in concert or participation with them, and their respective \nhealth plans and any insurers or TPAs in connection with such health plans.  To come within the \nscope of this order, a CBA member must meet the following criteria: \n(a) The employer is not yet protected from interpretations of Section 1557 and Title VII \nthat require the provision or coverage of gender transitions by any other judicial order; \n(b) The CBA has determined that the employer meets the CBA’s strict membership \ncriteria; \n(c) The CBA’s membership criteria have not changed since the CBA filed its initial \ncomplaint on December 28, 2016; and \n56 \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 124   Filed 01/19/21   Page 57 of 57\n(d) The employer is not subject to an adverse ruling on the merits in another case involving \ninterpretations of Section 1557 and Title VII that require the provision or coverage of \ngender transitions. \nThe Court will set a status conference with the parties in the coming days to discuss resolution of \nthe remaining claims. \n  IT IS SO ORDERED. \n  Dated this 19th day of January, 2021. \n            /s/ Peter D.

Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) prohibits any federally \nfunded health program from engaging in sex discrimination. This means federally \nfunded health programs are prohibited from engaging in any practices that would \ntreat men better than women, or vice versa.  \n2.  The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), however, inter-\nprets Section 1557 more broadly. It interprets “sex” discrimination to include discrim-\nination based on “gender identity” or “termination of pregnancy.” And based on this \ninterpretation, HHS says doctors and hospitals must perform and pay for controver-\nsial gender transition procedures and abortions on pain of massive financial penal-\nties—even when doing so would violate their religious beliefs and medical judgment.  \n3.  Plaintiffs are four private Catholic organizations and one State that are \nadversely affected by HHS’s interpretation of Section 1557. They seek a ruling that \nHHS’s interpretation of Section 1557 is unlawful, as well as an injunction prohibiting \nHHS from interpreting and enforcing Section 1557 in a way that would force them to \nperform or pay for gender-transition procedures and abortions in violation of their \nreligious beliefs and medical judgment.   \nI. PARTIES \n4.  Plaintiff Religious Sisters of Mercy (“Sisters of Mercy”) is a Catholic or-\nder of religious sisters devoted to works of mercy, including offering healthcare to the \nunderserved. Located in Alma, Michigan, the Sisters of Mercy is a nonprofit corpora-\ntion incorporated in 1973. The Sisters of Mercy are an international institute of pon-\ntifical right—that is, officially approved by the Vatican—which traces its roots back \nto Venerable Catherine McAuley in Dublin, Ireland in 1831. \n5.  Each Sister of Mercy has chosen to follow Jesus Christ by taking a life-\ntime vow to serve the poor and sick by offering care for the whole person, and working \n2 \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 95   Filed 11/23/20   Page 3 of 70\nto heal those who are suffering from physical, psychological, intellectual, and spir-\nitual woundedness. The Sisters of Mercy offer a variety of apostolic services. One as-\npect of their mission is fulfilled through “comprehensive health care” services, which \nthe Sisters of Mercy understand as “the complete care of the total human person” \nwhich “seeks to bring about that profound and extensive healing which is a continu-\nation of the work of redemption.” Consistent with this mission, some of the Sisters of \nMercy serve in healthcare facilities, such as hospitals, throughout the country. These \nSisters include licensed doctors, including a surgeon, and other healthcare profes-\nsionals. In accordance with their vows, the Sisters of Mercy offer healthcare services \nin accordance with the Ethical and Religious Directives of the United States Confer-\nence of Catholic Bishops.  \n6.  The Sisters of Mercy own and operate a clinic, Plaintiff Sacred Heart \nMercy Health Care Center in Alma, Michigan. The clinic is a nonprofit incorporated \nin Michigan. The Sisters of Mercy also run their clinic in accordance with the Ethical \nand Religious Directives of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops. Some \nof the Sisters of Mercy serve as licensed doctors, nurses, or other healthcare profes-\nsionals who perform medical services in this clinic.  \n7.  Plaintiff  Sisters  of  Mary  of  the  Presentation  Health  System  (“SMP \nHealth System”) is a non-profit Catholic health system headquartered in Valley City, \nNorth Dakota. It was founded and is operated by the Sisters of Mary of the Presen-\ntation. The Sisters believe that Catholic health care services and programs are eccle-\nsial in nature, mandated by the Church to carry on the healing ministry of Jesus. \n8.  As part of that healing ministry, SMP Health System provides a variety \nof health care services throughout North Dakota, including hospitals, clinics, long-\nterm care facilities, and senior housing.   \n9.  SMP Health System’s mission statement is as follows: “SMP Health Sys-\ntem, inspired by the Sisters of Mary of the Presentation, provides leadership to its \n3 \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 95   Filed 11/23/20   Page 4 of 70\nCatholic health care ministries as they work to fulfill the healing mission of Jesus.” \nIn accordance with that mission, the Sisters of Mary run the health care ministries \nin accordance with the Ethical and Religious Directives of the United States Confer-\nence of Catholic Bishops. \n10.  Plaintiff University of Mary is a Roman Catholic Benedictine University \nwith its primary campus in Bismarck, North Dakota. The University of Mary also \nhas campuses throughout North Dakota and in several other states, Arequipa, Peru, \nand Rome, Italy. The University offers more than 60 degree programs, including \nnursing, theology, pastoral ministry, and Catholic studies.  \n11.  The University strives to infuse all of its programs with Christian, Cath-\nolic, Benedictine values to prepare its students to be ethical leaders in their careers \nand their communities. The University welcomes students of all faiths and back-\ngrounds, and, as is fundamental to its mission, upholds Catholic teaching in all of its \nprograms and services. The University provides health benefits to its employees \nthrough a self-funded health plan. The University offers a nursing program and many \nallied health programs, including physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech and \nlanguage pathology, radiologic technology, respiratory therapy, exercise science, ath-\nletic training, and social work.  \n12.  The State of North Dakota oversees and controls several agencies and a \nhealthcare facility that receive federal funding administered by HHS. For example, \nNorth Dakota State Hospital, located in Jamestown, is a state-run hospital that ac-\ncepts HHS-administered funding and provides psychiatric and chemical dependency \ntreatment to North Dakotans who require in-patient or specialized residential care. \nIts clinical disciplines include psychiatry, psychology, nursing, social work, addiction \ncounseling, chaplaincy, education, occupational therapy, therapeutic recreation, and \nvocational rehabilitation. North Dakota also employs many healthcare employees \n4 \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 95   Filed 11/23/20   Page 5 of 70\nthrough its constituent agencies, and provides health benefits to those employees and \ntheir families. \n13.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n16.  The Court has subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 \nand 1361.  \n17.  Venue lies in this district pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391.  \nIII. FACTUAL BACKGROUND \nA. The Affordable Care Act and Related Federal Statutes. \n18.  In March 2010, Congress passed, and President Obama signed into law, \nthe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Pub. L. 111-148 (March 23, 2010), \nand the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, Pub. L. 111-152 (March 30, \n2010), collectively known as the “Affordable Care Act” or “ACA.” \n19.  Section 1557 of the ACA states that no individual can be denied certain \nfederally funded health benefits because of the individual’s race, color, national \norigin, sex, age, or disability. 42 U.S.C. § 18116. Section 1557 does not add a new non-\ndiscrimination provision to the United States Code, but merely incorporates by refer-\nence pre-existing provisions under Title VI, Title IX, the Americans with Disabilities \nAct, and the Rehabilitation Act. Section 1557 does not independently define terms \n5 \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 95   Filed 11/23/20   Page 6 of 70\nsuch as “sex.” Section 1557’s sole basis for prohibiting sex discrimination is based on \nits reference to Title IX, 20 U.S.C. § 1681 et seq. \n20.  Title IX does not apply to covered entities “controlled by a religious or-\nganization if the application of this subsection would not be consistent with the reli-\ngious tenets of such organization.” 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a)(3). \n21.  Title IX also states that it cannot be “construed to require or prohibit \nany person, or public or private entity, to provide or pay for any benefit or service, \nincluding the use of facilities, related to an abortion.” 20 U.S.C. § 1688. This provision \nis sometimes called the Danforth Amendment or the abortion neutrality exemption. \n22.  At the time that the ACA was enacted in 2010, no federal courts and no \nfederal agencies had interpreted “sex” in Title IX to include gender identity.  \n23.  At the time that the ACA was enacted, and to this day, Congress has \nrepeatedly rejected attempts to expand the term “sex” in Title IX. Lawmakers have \nalso rejected multiple attempts to amend the Civil Rights Act to add the new catego-\nries of “sexual orientation” and “gender identity.” The first such attempt was in 1974, \nand there have been dozens of such attempts since then. They have repeatedly failed.  \n24.  The ACA states that “nothing in this title (or any amendment made by \nthis title), shall be construed to require a qualified health plan to provide [abortion] \ncoverage  ...  as  part  of  its  essential  health  benefits  for  any  plan  year.”  42 \nU.S.C. § 18023(b)(1)(A)(i).  \n25.  Federally-funded programs may not require an “individual to perform \nor assist in the performance of any sterilization procedure or abortion if his perfor-\nmance or assistance in the performance of such procedure or abortion would be con-\ntrary to his religious beliefs or moral convictions.” 42 U.S.C. § 300a-7(b)(1). Congress \nhas also mandated that “[n]o individual shall be required to perform or assist in the \nperformance of any part of a health service program or research activity funded in \n6 \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 95   Filed 11/23/20   Page 7 of 70\nwhole or in part under a program administered by the Secretary of Health and Hu-\nman Services if his performance or assistance in the performance of such part of such \nprogram or activity would be contrary to his religious beliefs or moral convictions.” \nId. § 300a-7(d). \nB. The 2016 Rule \n26.  On September 8, 2015, HHS proposed a new rule to “interpret” Section \n1557 of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), to extend Title IX’s definition of “sex” to in-\nclude “gender identity,” “sex stereotyping,” and “termination of pregnancy,” among \nother things. Nondiscrimination in Health Programs and Activities, 81 Fed. Reg. \n31,376, 31,467 (May 18, 2016) (the “2016 Rule”).  \n27.  The 2016 Rule was published as final on May 18, 2016, and it expanded \nthe definition of “gender identity” even further from the proposed definition to mean \nan individual’s “internal sense of gender, which may be male, female, neither, or a \ncombination of male and female.” Id. HHS stated that the “gender identity spectrum \nincludes an array of possible gender identities beyond male and female,” and individ-\nuals with “non-binary gender identities are protected under the rule.” 81 Fed. Reg. at \n31,392, 31,384. HHS cited as authority a “Dear Colleague” letter issued jointly by the \nDepartment of Education (ED) and Department of Justice (DOJ) just five days ear-\nlier.1  \n28.  HHS also defined “sex” to include discrimination based upon “termina-\ntion of pregnancy” in covered programs. HHS declined to add an explicit carve-out for \nabortion and abortion-related services parallel to the carve-out included in Title IX; \nit merely noted the existence of conscience protections in federal law and ACA limi-\ntations on requirement for abortion coverage in certain contexts. Id. at 31,388.  \n \n1 U.S. Dep’t of Justice & U.S. Dep’t of Educ., Dear Colleague Letter on Transgender Students, May \n13, 2016, https://perma.cc/B7WQ-942F. \n7 \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 95   Filed 11/23/20   Page 8 of 70\n29.  HHS’s new interpretation of Section 1557 applied to any entities or in-\ndividuals that operate, offer, or contract for health programs and activities that re-\nceive any Federal financial assistance from HHS.2 In light of this sweeping applica-\ntion, HHS estimated the 2016 Rule would “likely cover[] almost all licensed physi-\ncians because they accept Federal financial assistance,” including payments from \nMedicare and Medicaid.3 Other observers have estimated that the 2016 Rule applies \n“to over 133,000 (virtually all) hospitals, nursing homes, home health agencies, and \nsimilar  provider  facilities,  about  445,000  clinical  laboratories,  1,200  community \nhealth centers, 171 health-related schools, state Medicaid and CHIP programs, state \npublic health agencies, federally facilitated and state-based marketplaces, at least \n180 health insurers that market policies through the FFM and state-based market-\nplaces, and up to 900,000 physicians.”4 \n30.  Under Section 1557, then, covered entities would now be required to \nprovide health programs or activities in accordance with HHS’s expansive and un-\nwarranted definition of “sex.” This includes a number of new requirements. \n1.  Healthcare professionals must perform or refer for medical \ntransition procedures. \n31.  HHS’s interpretation of Section 1557 requires covered employers, and \ntheir healthcare providers and professionals, to perform (or refer for) medical transi-\ntion procedures (such as hysterectomies, mastectomies, hormone treatments, plastic \nsurgery, etc.), if a physician or healthcare provider offers analogous services in other \ncontexts. For example, explaining the impact of interpreting “sex” discrimination to \n \n2 45 C.F.R. § 92.4. \n3 Nondiscrimination in Health Programs and Activities, 80 Fed. Reg. 54,172, 54,195 (proposed Sept. 8, \n2015); 81 Fed. Reg. at 31,445. \n4 Timothy Jost, Implementing Health Reform: HHS Proposes Rule Implementing Anti-Discrimination \nACA Provisions (Contraceptive Coverage Litigation Update), Health Affairs Blog (Sept. 4, 2015), \nhttps://perma.cc/QKR5-A8T8. \n8 \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 95   Filed 11/23/20   Page 9 of 70\ninclude “gender identity,” HHS stated: “A provider specializing in gynecological ser-\nvices that previously declined to provide a medically necessary hysterectomy for a \ntransgender  man  would  have  to  revise  its  policy  to  provide  the  procedure  for \ntransgender individuals in the same manner it provides the procedure for other indi-\nviduals.”5 HHS explained that a hysterectomy in this medical transition context \nwould be “medically necessary to treat gender dysphoria,”6 thereby declaring medical \nnecessity, benefit, and prudence as a matter of federal law, and without regard to the \nopinions, judgment, and conscientious considerations of the many medical profession-\nals that hold views to the contrary. \n32.  There is widespread, well-documented debate about the medical risks \nand ethics associated with various medical transition procedures, even within the \ntransgender community itself. In fact, HHS’s own medical experts wrote, “Based on \na thorough review of the clinical evidence available at this time, there is not enough \nevidence to determine whether gender reassignment surgery improves health out-\ncomes for Medicare beneficiaries with gender dysphoria.”7 The evidence shows that \n“[t]here were conflicting (inconsistent) study results—of the best designed studies, \nsome reported benefits while others reported harms.”8 Yet HHS’s interpretation of \nSection 1557 attempts to preempt the serious medical and moral debate about gender \ntransition procedures by concluding in the context of physicians offering “health ser-\nvices” that a “categorization of all transition-related treatment ... as experimental, is \noutdated and not based on current standards of care.”9 HHS has also improperly at-\n \n5 81 Fed. Reg. at 31,455. \n6 Id. at 31,429. \n7 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, Proposed Decision Memo for Gender Dysphoria and Gen-\nder Reassignment Surgery (June 2, 2016). \n8 Id. (emphasis added). \n9 81 Fed. Reg. at 31,435; see also id. at 31,429. \n9 \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 95   Filed 11/23/20   Page 10 of 70\ntempted to preempt the prerogative of States not only to regulate the healing profes-\nsions, but also to maintain standards of care that rely upon the medical judgment of \nhealth professionals as to what is in the best interests of their patients. \n33.  Furthermore, a number of commenters requested that HHS make clear \nthat health services need only be covered if they are deemed to be “medically neces-\nsary” or “medically appropriate” in the professional opinion of those charged with the \ncare of the patient at issue. But HHS refused to make this clarification, stating that \nsome procedures “related to gender transition” may be required even if they were not \n“strictly identified as medically necessary or appropriate.”10 Thus, under HHS’s in-\nterpretation of Section 1557, if a doctor would perform a mastectomy as part of a \nmedically-necessary treatment for breast cancer, it would be illegal for the same doc-\ntor to decline to perform a mastectomy for a medical transition, even if the doctor \nbelieved that removing healthy breast tissue was contrary to the patient’s medical \ninterest.  \n34.  Because Plaintiff SMP Health System provides hysterectomies to some \npatients, such as those diagnosed with uterine cancer, HHS’s interpretation of Sec-\ntion 1557 would simultaneously force it to provide a hysterectomy (and remove an \notherwise healthy uterus) for a medical transition, notwithstanding the serious po-\ntential harm to the patient. Elective hysterectomies increase a number of health risks \nfor the patient. Moreover, such a procedure also renders an individual permanently \nsterile. Nevertheless, the 2016 Rule requires Plaintiffs to perform that procedure \neven when they believe it is not in the best interests of the patient. Such a standard \nturns the venerable medical oath to “do no harm” on its head. \n \n10 Id. at 31,435. \n10 \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 95   Filed 11/23/20   Page 11 of 70\n35.  And while Plaintiffs, such as the Sacred Heart Mercy Health Care Cen-\nter clinic, provide hormone treatments to patients for medical reasons in some con-\ntexts, these health professionals have serious medical and religious concerns with \noffering hormone treatment for a medical transition.  \n2.  Healthcare facilities and professionals must alter their \nspeech and medical advice. \n36.  As discussed above, HHS concluded, in the context of physicians offering \n“health services,” that a “categorization of all transition-related treatment ... as ex-\nperimental, is outdated and not based on current standards of care.”11 In so doing, \nHHS has seriously curbed a physician’s ability to offer a contrary view, even if such \na view is based on the physician’s professional training and best medical judgment. \nHHS’s interpretation of Section 1557 thus forces healthcare providers to alter speech \nand medical advice to comply with the Rule. \n37.  HHS’s interpretation of Section 1557 compels the speech of healthcare \nprofessionals in several ways. For example, the 2016 Rule mandates revisions to \nhealthcare professionals’ written policies, requiring express affirmance that transi-\ntion-related procedures will be provided,12 even if such revisions do not reflect the \nmedical judgment, values, or beliefs of the individuals or organizations. Second, it \nrequires physicians to use gender-transition affirming language in all situations re-\ngardless of circumstance, and provides as just one example the requirement that med-\nical providers use “a transgender individual’s preferred name and pronoun.”13 HHS \nalso relies upon a transgender medical guidance document stating that “Mental \n \n11 Id. at 31,435 \n12 Id. at 31,455. \n13 Id. at 31,406. \n11 \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 95   Filed 11/23/20   Page 12 of 70\nhealth professionals should not impose a binary view of gender.”14 Thus, to avoid fac-\ning liability for being discriminatory according to HHS, healthcare professionals are \ncompelled to speak by revising their policy to endorse transition-related services, to \nexpress language that is affirming of gender transition, and to express and explore a \nview of gender that is not binary. Further, by treating as discriminatory a medical \nview of “transition-related treatment ... as experimental,”15 the 2016 Rule coerces \nmedical professionals like Plaintiffs to speak about these procedures the way the gov-\nernment wants them to, even though they disagree, and even though they believe \nthey are disserving their patients by concealing the information the government \nwants concealed. \n3.  Certain employers and insurance providers must offer em-\nployee benefits covering medical transition procedures. \n38.  HHS’s interpretation of Section 1557 also prohibits certain employers, \nhealth programs, or insurance plans from exercising judgment as to what they cover. \nHHS stated, “[A]n explicit, categorical (or automatic) exclusion or limitation of cover-\nage for all health services related to gender transition is unlawful on its face.”16  \n39.  For example, if a doctor concludes that a hysterectomy “is medically nec-\nessary to treat gender dysphoria,” the patient’s employer or insurance plan would be \nrequired to cover the procedure on the same basis that it would cover it for other \nconditions (like cancer).17 HHS also stated that the “range of transition-related ser-\nvices, which includes treatment for gender dysphoria, is not limited to surgical treat-\nments and may include, but is not limited to, services such as hormone therapy and \n \n14 ECF No. 6-8 at 16 (cited at 81 Fed. Reg. at 31,435 n.263). \n15 81 Fed. Reg. at 31,435. \n16 Id. at 31,429.  \n17 Id.  \n12 \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 95   Filed 11/23/20   Page 13 of 70\npsychotherapy, which may occur over the lifetime of the individual.”18 As such, cov-\nerage is required notwithstanding the rights of employers that only offer employee \nhealth benefits consistent with the religious beliefs and values of their organization. \n40.  This conflict with religious or otherwise conscientious employers ex-\ntends beyond treatment surrounding gender dysphoria, because some required pro-\ncedures (such as elective hysterectomies) result in sterilization, and the 2016 Rule \nalso extends to “termination of pregnancy.” 45 C.F.R. § 92.4. Although HHS stated \nthat laws protecting religious objections to abortion (or “termination of pregnancy”) \nwill apply, HHS has previously approved California forcing all insurers to include \nabortion coverage, even for objecting religious institutions. And HHS could have in-\ncluded, but explicitly chose to exclude, a clear regulatory carve-out for services related \nto abortion that parallels the carve-out in Title IX.  \n41.  This health benefit requirement of the 2016 Rule applies to any of the \nfollowing types of employers who receive HHS funding: 1) any entity principally in-\nvolved in providing or administering health services (including hospitals, nursing \nhomes, counseling centers, physicians’ offices, etc.), 2) any type of employer who re-\nceived HHS funding for the primary purpose of funding an “employee health benefit \nprogram,” or 3) any entity such as a university with a health training or research \nprogram that received HHS funding or Federal financial assistance—including stu-\ndent Pell grants—for that “health program or activity.”19 \n42.  Thus, employers who have always offered employee health benefits that \nreflect their religious or conscientious beliefs, and excluded medical transition proce-\ndures from employee benefits, are considered discriminatory under the 2016 Rule. \n \n18 Id. at 31,435-36. \n19 Id. at 31,472, 45 C.F.R. § 92.208; see also 81 Fed. Reg. at 31,437. \n13 \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 95   Filed 11/23/20   Page 14 of 70\n4.  Sex-specific healthcare facilities or programs, including \nshower facilities or hospital wards, must be opened to indi-\nviduals based on gender identity. \n43.  With regard to facilities, HHS stated that the prohibition on “gender \nidentity” and “sex stereotyping” discrimination means that even for sex-specific facil-\nities such as “shower facilities” offered by healthcare providers, individuals may not \nbe excluded “based on their gender identity.”20  \n44.  When Title IX—the foundation for the 2016 Rule—was enacted, Con-\ngress was significantly concerned about protecting and preserving the privacy rights \nof individuals in intimate areas. See 20 U.S.C. § 1686, 117 Cong. Rec. 30407 (1971), \n117 Cong. Rec. 39260 (1971), 117 Cong. Rec. 39263 (1971), and 118 Cong. Rec. 5807 \n(1972). And the predecessor agency of HHS, the Department of Health, Education, \nand Welfare (HEW), promulgated regulations guaranteeing the privacy of individuals \nin intimate areas. See 34 C.F.R. § 106.32(b); 34 C.F.R. § 106.33 (“A recipient may pro-\nvide separate toilet, locker room, and shower facilities on the basis of sex ...”). Yet, in \npromulgating the 2016 Rule, HHS wholly disregarded any “legal right to privacy” \nthat could be violated “simply by permitting another person access to a sex-specific \nprogram or facility which corresponds to their gender identity.”21 \n45.  With regard to other health programs, HHS stated that sex-specific \nhealth programs or activities are allowable only where the covered entity can demon-\nstrate an exceedingly persuasive justification, i.e., that the sex-specific program is \nsubstantially related to the achievement of an important health-related or scientific \nobjective. HHS stated that it “will expect a covered entity to supply objective evidence, \n \n20 81 Fed. Reg. at 31,409. \n21 Id. at 31,389, 31,409. \n14 \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 95   Filed 11/23/20   Page 15 of 70\nand empirical data if available, to justify the need to restrict participation in the pro-\ngram to only one sex,” and in “no case will [HHS] accept a justification that relies on \noverly broad generalizations about the sexes.”22 \n5.  Enforcement Mechanisms and Remedial Measures. \n46.  The 2016 Rule requires covered entities to record and submit compliance \nreports to HHS’s Office of Civil Rights (“OCR”) upon request.23   \n47.  Covered entities that are found to violate the 2016 Rule could lose their \nfederal funding, be barred from doing business with the government, or risk false \nclaims liability.24  \n48.  Covered entities are subject to enforcement proceedings by the Depart-\nment of Justice.25 \n49.  Covered entities are also subject to individual lawsuits from patients \nwho believed the covered entity violated the 2016 Rule.26 \n6.  No Religious Exemption \n50.  Section 1557 does not independently prohibit discrimination on the ba-\nsis of sex. Instead, Congress specifically invoked Title IX, 20 U.S.C. § 1681 et seq., \nwhich includes both a ban on sex discrimination and a broad exemption for religious \norganizations. In interpreting Section 1557 in the 2016 Rule, however, HHS “inter-\npreted” Congress’s reference to Title IX to include the ban, but not the religious ex-\nemption.  \n51.  Although HHS was asked to include a religious exemption in the 2016 \nRule due to the obvious implications for religious healthcare providers, HHS declined \n \n22 Id. at 31,409. \n23 81 Fed. Reg. at 31,439, 31,472, 45 C.F.R. § 92.301. \n24 81 Fed. Reg. at 31,472, 45 C.F.R. § 92.301 (“The enforcement mechanisms available for and provided \nunder Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 ... shall apply for purposes of Section 1557.”) \n25 81 Fed. Reg. at 31,440. \n26 Id. at 31,472, 45 C.F.R. § 92.301. \n15 \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 95   Filed 11/23/20   Page 16 of 70\nto do so, stating instead that religious objectors could assert claims under existing \nstatutory protections for religious freedom.27 HHS also failed to provide any mecha-\nnism by which a religious entity could determine if it was entitled to any existing \nreligious protections under the law. HHS’s refusal to protect the conscience rights (or \neven medical judgment) of physicians is striking when compared to federal policy in \nother areas. For example, a recent TRICARE guidance memo states in the context of \nmedical gender dysphoria treatment, “In no circumstance will a provider be required \nto deliver care that he or she feels unprepared to provide either by lack of clinical skill \nor due to ethical, moral, or religious beliefs.”28 \nC. Franciscan Alliance v. Burwell \n52.  On August 23, 2016, States, religious hospitals, and religious healthcare \nprofessionals challenged the 2016 Rule in the Northern District of Texas. Franciscan \nAll., Inc. v. Burwell, No. 16-cv-108, ECF No. 1 (N.D. Tex. filed Aug. 23, 2016). \n53.  On December 31, 2016, the district court in Franciscan Alliance prelim-\ninarily enjoined HHS from enforcing the 2016 Rule’s prohibition against discrimina-\ntion on the basis of “gender identity” and “termination of pregnancy.” Franciscan All., \nInc. v. Burwell, 227 F. Supp. 3d 660, 670 (N.D. Tex. 2016). \n54.  The court concluded that HHS’s “implement[ation] of Section 1557” had \nlikely violated RFRA by “plac[ing] substantial pressure on [Appellants] to perform \nand cover transition and abortion procedures” without its action being narrowly tai-\nlored to a compelling government interest. Id. at 691-93.  \n55.  The court also agreed that the 2016 Rule exceeded HHS’s statutory au-\nthority by defining “sex” discrimination under Section 1557 to include discrimination \n \n27 81 Fed. Reg. at 31,376. \n28 ECF No. 6-9 at 2-3. \n16 \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 95   Filed 11/23/20   Page 17 of 70\non the basis of “gender identity” and by not incorporating Title IX’s religion and abor-\ntion exemptions. Id. at 687-91. \n56.  In 2017, the Franciscan Alliance court granted HHS’s motion for a stay \nof the litigation allowing HHS to reconsider the challenged aspects of the 2016 Rule. \nFranciscan Alliance, No. 16-cv-108, ECF No. 105 (N.D. Tex. filed July 10, 2017). \n57.  In December 2018—after over a year of inaction from HHS—the Fran-\nciscan Alliance court reopened the litigation, id., ECF No. 126 (N.D. Tex. filed Dec. \n17, 2018), and the plaintiffs sought summary judgment, e.g., id., ECF No. 136 (N.D. \nTex. filed Feb. 4, 2019). Pursuant to their RFRA claim, the plaintiffs sought an in-\njunction stating that HHS should be “permanently enjoined” from “[c]onstruing Sec-\ntion 1557 to require Private Plaintiffs to provide medical services or insurance cover-\nage related to ‘gender identity’ or ‘termination of pregnancy’ in violation of their reli-\ngious beliefs.” Id., ECF No. 135-1 (N.D. Tex. filed Feb. 4, 2019). And plaintiffs addi-\ntionally sought a vacatur of the unlawful portions of the 2016 Rule, which corre-\nsponded with their APA claim. Id. \n58.  In May 2019, while the summary-judgment motions were pending, HHS \nissued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking proposing to amend the 2016 Rule. Id., ECF \nNo. 159 (N.D. Tex. filed May 31, 2019). \n59.  Citing the Franciscan Alliance court’s preliminary-injunction decision, \nthe proposed rule stated that the 2016 Rule’s definition of “sex” “exceeded [HHS’s] \nauthority under Section 1557.” Id. at 15. The proposed rule sought to address this \nissue by repealing the 2016 Rule’s definition of “sex” in its entirety, which would al-\nlegedly “allow the Federal courts, in particular, the U.S. Supreme Court ... to resolve \nany dispute about the proper legal interpretation of” “sex” in Section 1557. Id. at 112-\n13. As the proposed rule noted, the Supreme Court had recently granted certiorari to \ndecide whether “sex” discrimination under Title VII included discrimination on the \n17 \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 95   Filed 11/23/20   Page 18 of 70\nbasis of “sexual orientation” and “gender identity,” in three cases that would be de-\ncided together as Bostock v. Clayton County, 140 S. Ct. 1731 (2020). Id. at 40-41. \n60.  On October 15, 2019, the Franciscan Alliance court granted summary \njudgment for the plaintiffs. Franciscan All., Inc. v. Azar, 414 F. Supp. 3d 928 (N.D. \nTex. 2019). The court found “no reason to depart from its” preliminary-injunction \nanalysis on the merits, concluding that the 2016 Rule violated both RFRA and the \nAPA. Id. at 942.  \n61.  The court concluded, however, that the proper remedy was vacatur of \n“the unlawful portions of” the 2016 Rule, “not a permanent injunction.” Id. at 944-45; \nsee Franciscan Alliance, No. 16-cv-108, ECF No. 182 (N.D. Tex. Nov. 21, 2019) (clari-\nfying that the 2016 Rule was vacated “insofar as [it] defines ‘On the basis of sex’ to \ninclude gender identity and termination of pregnancy”).  \n62.  HHS did not appeal the court’s ruling on the merits; the plaintiffs, how-\never, appealed the denial of injunctive relief to the Fifth Circuit, where their appeal \nis now pending. Franciscan All., Inc. v. Azar, No. 20-10093 (5th Cir. filed Jan. 24, \n2020). \nD. The 2020 Rule \n63.  On June 12, 2020, HHS issued a new Section 1557 rule, finalizing the \nrule proposed in 2019. See Nondiscrimination in Health and Health Education Pro-\ngrams or Activities, 85 Fed. Reg. 37,160 (June 19, 2020) (the “2020 Rule”). \n64.  The 2020 Rule made a number of changes to the 2016 Rule. HHS noted \nthat the 2020 Rule was promulgated in part in response to the Franciscan Alliance \ncourt’s orders.  See, e.g., id. at 37,164-65; id. at 37,168. Two changes are most relevant \nhere. \n1.  “Sex” Discrimination \n18 \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 95   Filed 11/23/20   Page 19 of 70\n65.  First, the 2020 Rule repealed the 2016 Rule’s definition of “sex” discrim-\nination, which included, among other things, discrimination based on “gender iden-\ntity,” “sex stereotyping,” and “termination of pregnancy.” Id. at 37,167. HHS con-\ncluded that “the 2016 Rule’s extension of sex-discrimination protections to encompass \ngender identity was contrary to the text of Title IX.” Id. at 37,168. \n66.  HHS, however, declined to replace the 2016 Rule’s definition of “sex” \nwith a new definition, reasoning instead that the Supreme Court’s then-forthcoming \ndecision in Bostock would “likely have ramifications for the definition of ‘on the basis \nof sex’ under Title IX.” Id. at 37,168; id. (“[T]his rule … does not define sex[.]”); id. at \n37,178 (“This final rule repeals the 2016 Rule’s definition of ‘on the basis of sex,’ but \ndeclines to replace it with a new regulatory definition.”). HHS clarified that simply \nrepealing the 2016 Rule’s prior definition would then permit “application of the [Bos-\ntock] Court’s construction.” Id. at 37,168. \n2.   Abortion and Religious Organizations \n67.  Additionally, under the 2020 Rule, HHS noted that it would “interpret \nSection 1557’s prohibition on sex-based discrimination consistent with Title IX and \nits implementing regulations.” Id. at 37,192. To this end, the 2020 Rule implemented \ntwo provisions related to abortion and religious organizations. \n68.  First,  HHS  explained  that  the  Section  1557  regulations  are  imple-\nmented consistent with the abortion neutrality exemption in Title IX, which states \nthat nothing in Title IX “shall be construed to require or prohibit any person, or public \nor private entity, to provide or pay for any benefit or service, including the use of \nfacilities, related to an abortion.” 20 U.S.C. § 1688; 85 Fed. Reg. at 37,192. HHS noted \nthat its decision to incorporate Title IX’s abortion neutrality exemption into the 2020 \nRule was also justified by the Franciscan Alliance court’s decision “vacat[ing] the ‘ter-\nmination of pregnancy’ language in the 2016 Rule because it failed to incorporate the \nabortion-neutrality language from” Title IX. Id. at 37,193. \n19 \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 95   Filed 11/23/20   Page 20 of 70\n69.  Second, while the 2016 Rule declined to incorporate Title IX’s religious \nexemption, HHS reevaluated the issue and recognized that “Section 1557’s prohibi-\ntion on sex-based discrimination” must be interpreted in a manner “consistent with \nTitle IX and its implementing regulations.” Id. at 37,192. Title IX itself states that \n“this section shall not apply to an educational institution which is controlled by a \nreligious organization if the application of this subsection would not be consistent \nwith the religious tenets of such organization.” 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a)(3); 20 U.S.C. \n§ 1687(4) (Title IX covers defined “program[s] or activit[ies]” but “does not include \nany operation of an entity which is controlled by a religious organization if the appli-\ncation of section 1681 of this title to such operation would not be consistent with the \nreligious tenets of such organization”). \n70.  HHS, however, did not believe the Title IX religious exemption applied \nto all religious institutions. And HHS explained that the 2020 Rule did not itself in-\nclude “a religious exemption, whether narrow or broad.” 85 Fed. Reg. at 37,205. In-\nstead, the 2020 Rule simply applied Title IX’s existing religious exemption to “[a]ny \neducational operation of an entity ... control[led] by a religious organization.” Id. at \n37,207. This exemption would therefore only apply to an “educational operation of an \nentity  controlled  by  a  religious  organization  engaged  in  the  provision  of  health \ncare ... if application of [Section 1557 and the 2020 Rule] would be inconsistent with \nthe organization’s religious tenets.” Whitman-Walker Clinic, Inc. v. U.S. Dep't of \nHealth & Human Servs., No. 20-cv-1630, 2020 WL 5232076, at *27 (D.D.C. Sept. 2, \n2020). \n71.  As a result, the 2020 Rule’s Title IX religious exemption does not apply \nto all religious organizations covered by the Rule, including Plaintiffs. Instead, it ap-\nplies only to an “educational operation of an entity controlled by a religious organiza-\ntion engaged in the provision of health care.” Id. \n3.   Bostock and Challenges to the 2020 Rule \n20 \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 95   Filed 11/23/20   Page 21 of 70\n72.  On  June  15,  2020,  the  Supreme  Court  decided  Bostock  v.  Clayton \nCounty. 140 S. Ct. 1731. \n73.  The Court held that when “an employer ... fires someone simply for be-\ning homosexual or transgender,” the employer has “discriminated against that indi-\nvidual ‘because of such individual’s sex’” within the meaning of Title VII. Id. at 1753.  \n74.  The Court cautioned, however, that its opinion did not “prejudge” the \nproper interpretation of “other federal or state laws that prohibit sex discrimination,” \nid., including Section 1557 and Title IX, see id. at 1779-82 & n.57 (Alito, J., dissent-\ning).  \n75.  The Bostock Court also explained it was “deeply concerned with preserv-\ning the promise of the free exercise of religion,” and that religious employers might \nnot be liable under Title VII “in cases like ours” if complying would require them “to \nviolate their religious convictions.” Id. at 1753-54 (majority opinion). \n76.  In particular, the Court invoked RFRA as a key protection for religious \nobjectors, describing it as a “super statute” that “might supersede ... in appropriate \ncases” an otherwise-applicable ban on gender-identity discrimination. Id. at 1754.  \n77.  Likewise addressing religious-freedom concerns, Justice Alito’s dissent \nnoted that “because some employers and healthcare providers”—like Plaintiffs here—\n“have strong religious objections to sex reassignment procedures,” extending Bostock \nso as to “require[]them to pay for or to perform” those procedures would “have a se-\nvere impact on their ability to honor their deeply held religious beliefs.” Id. at 1782 \n(Alito, J., dissenting). \n78.  Following Bostock, plaintiffs in multiple jurisdictions sued HHS, chal-\nlenging the 2020 Rule in light of Bostock and seeking restoration of the 2016 Rule, in \nwhole or in part. See Whitman-Walker Clinic, Inc. v. U.S. Dep’t of Health & Human \nServs., No. 20-cv-01630 (D.D.C. filed June 22, 2020); Walker v. Azar, No. 20-cv-02834 \n(E.D.N.Y. filed June 26, 2020); Boston All. of Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual & Transgender \n21 \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 95   Filed 11/23/20   Page 22 of 70\nYouth v. U.S. Dep’t of Health & Human Servs., No. 20-cv-11297 (D. Mass. filed July \n9, 2020); Washington v. U.S. Dep’t of Health & Human Servs., No. 20-cv-01105 (W.D. \nWash. filed July 16, 2020); New York v. U.S. Dep’t of Health & Human Servs., No. 20-\ncv-05583 (S.D.N.Y. filed July 20, 2020). \n79.  In each of these cases, the plaintiffs challenged some or all of the 2020 \nRule’s repeal of the 2016 Rule’s definition of “sex” discrimination, asserting that Bos-\ntock had rendered that repeal unlawful and that Section 1557 must be construed to \nprohibit “gender identity” discrimination. \n80.  Plaintiffs in these cases also challenged the 2020 Rule’s incorporation of \nTitle IX’s religious exemption, asserting that religious organizations, too, must be \nsubject to this expansive understanding of Section 1557’s “sex” discrimination prohi-\nbition. \n81.  In one of the cases, the State of Washington sued to enjoin three portions \nof the 2020 Rule: (1) HHS’s decision to repeal the 2016 Rule’s definition of “sex” dis-\ncrimination, particularly as it related to “gender identity” discrimination; (2) the 2020 \nRule’s incorporation of the Title IX religious exemption; and (3) the 2020 Rule’s nar-\nrower definition of “covered entities.” Washington v. U.S. Dep’t of Health & Human \nServs., No. C20-1105-JLR, 2020 WL 5095467, at *5 (W.D. Wash. Aug. 28, 2020). \n82.  The district court, however, concluded that Washington lacked Article \nIII standing to challenge the 2020 Rule. Id. The court concluded that in light of Bos-\ntock, it is possible that “Title IX and Section 1557 ... incorporate protection for gender \nidentity and sexual orientation discrimination” such that “the 2020 Rule does, in fact, \nextend protection against discrimination to LGBTQ individuals via the Rule’s incor-\nporation of Title IX by reference.” Id. at *8. As a result, Washington State did not \ndemonstrate that it had Article III standing to bring suit. Id. \n83.  In the remaining two cases, however, the district courts entered “over-\nlapping injunctions,” Whitman-Walker, 2020 WL 5232076, at *41 (internal quotation \n22 \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 95   Filed 11/23/20   Page 23 of 70\nmarks omitted), preventing the 2020 Rule “from becoming operative” and reinstating \nportions of the 2016 Rule, Walker v. Azar, No. 20-cv-02834, 2020 WL 4749859, at *1 \n(E.D.N.Y. Aug. 17, 2020).  \n84.  One of these courts acknowledged that it “has no power to revive a rule \nvacated by another district court,” namely the Franciscan Alliance court. Walker, \n2020 WL 4749859, at *7. Nevertheless, the court “predict[ed] that either the district \ncourt or some higher authority w[ould] revisit the vacatur,” and then specifically held \nthat portions of the 2016 Rule vacated by the Franciscan Alliance district court—\nincluding “the definitions of ‘on the basis of sex,’ ‘gender identity,’ and ‘sex stereotyp-\ning’”—“remain in effect.” Id. at *7, *10. \n85.  Indeed, in a later order, the district court doubled down, clarifying that \nits “existing stay/preliminary injunction of the repeal of the 2016 Rules’ definition of \n‘on the basis of sex,’ ‘gender identity,’ and ‘sex stereotyping’ ... remains in effect.” \nWalker v. Azar, No. 20-cv-02834, 2020 WL 6363970, *4 (E.D.N.Y. Oct. 29, 2020) (also \nenjoining repeal of the former 45 C.F.R. § 92.206). \n86.  The other district court held that a portion of the 2016 Rule purportedly \nnot vacated by the Franciscan Alliance court—namely, defining “sex” to include “sex \nstereotyping”—independently prohibits “[d]iscrimination based on transgender sta-\ntus—i.e., gender identity.” Whitman-Walker, 2020 WL 5232076, at *23, *45. \n87.  In other words, after enjoining the 2020 Rule, the district court con-\ncluded that “Plaintiffs [are] left with the 2016 Rule’s prohibition on discrimination \nbased on sex stereotyping,” which, according to the Whitman-Walker court, would \ninclude prohibiting gender identity discrimination. Id. at *14. \n88.  The Whitman-Walker court also enjoined the 2020 Rule’s incorporation \nof the religious exemption from Title IX, even though the Franciscan Alliance court \nheld that the 2016 Rule was arbitrary and capricious for not including Title IX’s reli-\ngious exemption. Id. at *27-29. \n23 \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 95   Filed 11/23/20   Page 24 of 70\n89.  In light of these lawsuits challenging the 2020 Rule, there now exists a \n“credible threat of prosecution” pursuant to Section 1557. Susan B. Anthony List v. \nDriehaus, 573 U.S. 149, 159 (2014). \n90.  Specifically, plaintiffs have challenged HHS’s decision to repeal the 2016 \nRule’s definitions for sex discrimination, which included defining sex discrimination \nas discrimination based on “termination of pregnancy” and “gender identity.”  \n91.  Plaintiffs have also challenged the 2020 Rule’s inclusion of an abortion \nneutrality exemption and a Title IX exemption, as well as the 2020 Rule’s decision to \nnarrow the definition of “covered entities” to not include health insurance providers. \n92.  Indeed, four of these cases are live and moving forward, and in some of \nthem, the plaintiffs have successfully enjoined important aspects of the 2020 Rule. \n93.  For example, under the decisions of the Whitman-Walker and Walker \ncourts, the vacated 2016 Rule “remains in effect” such that Plaintiffs can be held lia-\nble for “gender identity” discrimination by taking into account biological differences \nbetween men and women and by refusing to provide or assist with gender transition \nservices on account of their sincerely held religious beliefs.  \n94.  The Whitman-Walker court went even further, enjoining the 2020 Rule’s \nTitle IX religious exemption, even though the Franciscan Alliance court held that the \n2016 Rule was arbitrary and capricious for not including Title IX’s religious exemp-\ntion. Whitman-Walker, 2020 WL 5232076, at*27-29. \n95.  Furthermore, even under the Washington court’s decision holding that \nWashington lacked Article III standing to challenge the 2020 Rule, Plaintiffs can be \nheld liable for “gender identity” discrimination. According to the court, in light of Bos-\ntock, it is possible that “Title IX and Section 1557 ... incorporate protection for gender \nidentity and sexual orientation discrimination” such that “the 2020 Rule does, in fact, \nextend protection against discrimination to LGBTQ individuals via the Rule’s incor-\nporation of Title IX by reference.” Washington, 2020 WL 5095467, at *8. \n24 \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 95   Filed 11/23/20   Page 25 of 70\n96.  In light of these developments, Plaintiffs have standing to challenge Sec-\ntion 1557’s prohibition on gender identity discrimination because Plaintiffs have “an \nintention to engage in a course of conduct arguably affected with a constitutional in-\nterest, but proscribed by a statute, and ... a credible threat of prosecution thereun-\nder.” Jones v. Jegley, 947 F.3d 1100, 1103 (8th Cir. 2020) (quoting SBAL, 73 U.S. at \n159).  \n97.  That is, Plaintiffs have Article III standing because “there is a substan-\ntial risk that the harm will occur.” City of Kennett, Missouri v. Envtl. Prot. Agency, \n887 F.3d 424, 431 (8th Cir. 2018) (quotation marks omitted); see also Attias v. Care-\nfirst, Inc., 865 F.3d 620, 627 (D.C. Cir. 2017) (“[W]e have frequently upheld claims of \nstanding based on allegations of a ‘substantial risk’ of future injury.”). \nE. The Effect on the Sisters of Mercy \n98.  The Sisters of Mercy founded their order in 1973 for the purpose of car-\nrying out their faith in Jesus Christ by serving others. The Sisters of Mercy have a \nvariety of apostolate services that they offer. One aspect of their mission is fulfilled \nthrough “comprehensive health care” services, which the Sisters of Mercy understand \nas “the complete care of the total human person” which “seeks to bring about that \nprofound and extensive healing which is a continuation of the work of redemption.”  \nConsistent with this mission, some of the Sisters of Mercy serve in a variety of differ-\nent healthcare facilities, such as hospitals, throughout the country. These Sisters in-\nclude licensed doctors, including at least one surgeon, and other healthcare profes-\nsionals. In accordance with their vows, the Sisters of Mercy offer healthcare services \nin accordance with the Ethical and Religious Directives of the United States Confer-\nence of Catholic Bishops.  \n99.  The Sisters of Mercy hold religious beliefs about the nature and pur-\nposes of human sexuality, including that sexual identity is an objective fact rooted in \nnature as male or female persons. Like the Catholic Church they serve, the Sisters of \n25 \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 95   Filed 11/23/20   Page 26 of 70\nMercy believe that every man and woman is created in the image and likeness of God, \nand that they reflect God’s image in unique—and uniquely dignified—ways.  \n100.  Further, in their professional medical judgment, the Sisters of Mercy \nwho work in health care believe that optimal patient care—including in patient edu-\ncation, diagnosis, and treatment—requires taking account of the biological differ-\nences between men and women.  \n101.  In the Sisters’ best medical judgment, providing or assisting with gender \ntransition services is not in keeping with the best interests of their patients, and in \nfact is experimental and could be harmful for patients.  \n102.  Providing services that are contrary to their understanding of God’s plan \nfor human sexuality would also substantially burden the religious exercise of the Sis-\nters of Mercy.  \n103.  For decades, the religious beliefs of the Sisters of Mercy have been re-\nspected by health institutions where they work. But HHS’s novel interpretations of \nSection 1557 now make it illegal for employers to accommodate the religious beliefs \nof their employees.  \n104.  Thus, Section 1557, as newly interpreted, will impact the Sisters of \nMercy by requiring the Sisters of Mercy to offer medical services that violate their \nbest medical judgment and religious beliefs when they serve in healthcare organiza-\ntions that are covered entities. For example, Sisters of Mercy who offer endocrinology \nservices or mental health counseling for other medical reasons will now be required \nto provide these medical services as part of a gender transition, which would violate \nboth their best medical judgment and their religious beliefs. \n105.  Section 1557 also chills the Sisters’ ability to discuss their medical opin-\nions with their patients and offer medical advice freely. And Section 1557 would pres-\nsure the Sisters of Mercy to reject a binary view of gender, which is contrary to their \nmedical judgment and religious beliefs.  \n26 \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 95   Filed 11/23/20   Page 27 of 70\n106.  Section 1557, as newly interpreted, therefore threatens the ability of the \nSisters of Mercy to carry out their religious mission of providing comprehensive \nhealth care services in the healthcare facilities in which they work. \nF. The Effect on Sacred Heart Mercy Health Care Center \n107.  The Sisters of Mercy also own and operate a health clinic: Plaintiff Sa-\ncred Heart Mercy Health Care Center in Alma, Michigan. Some of the Sisters of \nMercy serve as licensed doctors, nurses, or other healthcare professionals in this \nclinic. The clinic provides resources to accommodate the spiritual needs of employees, \npatients, and their families. For example, the clinic offers Mass in its chapel, followed \nby the exposition of the Blessed Sacrament so that employees, patients, and local \nresidents can worship. The clinic is run by Sisters of Mercy themselves.  \n108.  The mission of the Sacred Heart Mercy Health Care Center in Michigan \nis to “embrace the extensive expressions of human woundedness in order to extend \nthe healing of the redemption of Jesus Christ.” Sacred Heart Mercy Health Care Cen-\nter, Mission, https://perma.cc/XZE8-BM8U. The vision of the Center is to “provide \noutstanding Catholic health care by embracing the misery of mankind as a point of \nconvergence with the Mercy of God through undertaking the works of mercy in a \ncomprehensive manner.” See id. \n109.  In accordance with this vision and mission, the clinic is operated in ac-\ncordance with The Ethical and Religious Directives for Catholic Healthcare Services, \nas promulgated by the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops and interpreted \nby the local Bishop.  \n110.  The Sacred Heart clinic strives to provide top-quality care to its patients. \nIt serves and respects individuals of all faiths, and seeks to ensure that patients and \ntheir families can exercise their own faith traditions in order to assist them in the \nhealing and recovery process, and to make critical decisions about matters such as \nend-of-life care and clinical ethics. HHS’s new interpretations of Section 1557 will \n27 \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 95   Filed 11/23/20   Page 28 of 70\nimpact the Sacred Heart clinic by 1) requiring the Sacred Heart clinic to offer medical \nservices that violate its best medical judgment and religious beliefs, and 2) requiring \nthe Sacred Heart clinic to provide insurance coverage for services that violate its re-\nligious beliefs.  \n1.  Compulsory Medical Services \n111.  The Sacred Heart clinic provides all of its standard medical services to \nevery individual who needs and qualifies for its care, including to individuals who \nidentify as transgender. Thus, for instance, if a transgender individual comes in with \nhigh blood pressure or a diabetes diagnosis, the Sacred Heart clinic would provide \nthe same full spectrum of compassionate care for that individual as it provides for \nevery other patient. And, just as it does for every other patient, the Sacred Heart \nclinic would appropriately tailor that care to the biologically sex-specific health needs \nof the patient.  \n112.  The Sacred Heart clinic and the Sisters who own and operate it hold \nreligious beliefs about the nature and purposes of human sexuality, including that \nsexual identity is an objective fact rooted in nature as male or female persons. Like \nthe Catholic Church they serve, they believe that every man and woman is created in \nthe image and likeness of God and that they reflect God’s image in unique—and \nuniquely dignified—ways.  \n113.  Further, in their professional medical judgment, the Sacred Heart clini-\ncians believe that optimal patient care—including patient education, diagnosis, and \ntreatment—requires taking account of the biological differences between men and \nwomen.  \n114.  In the best medical judgment of the Sacred Heart clinic and the Sisters \nwho own and operate it, providing or assisting with gender transition services is not \nin keeping with the best interests of their patients, and in fact is experimental and \ncould be harmful for patients.  \n28 \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 95   Filed 11/23/20   Page 29 of 70\n115.  Providing services that are contrary to their understanding of God’s plan \nfor human sexuality would also substantially burden the religious exercise of the Sa-\ncred Heart clinic and the Sisters who own and operate them.  \n116.  Accordingly, after careful review of the issue, the Sacred Heart clinic \nand the Sisters who own and operate it made the decision not to provide, perform, or \notherwise facilitate medical transitions. To provide or otherwise facilitate those ser-\nvices would also violate the religious beliefs of the Sacred Heart clinic and the Sisters \nwho own and operate it.  \n117.  The Sacred Heart clinic offers endocrinology hormone services and men-\ntal health counseling for anxiety and depression, including for pediatric patients. \nHHS’s novel interpretations of Section 1557 would force the Sacred Heart clinic to \noffer its services as a part of a medical transition, which would violate both its best \nmedical judgment and its religious beliefs.  \n118.  As newly interpreted, Section 1557 also chills the ability of the clinic and \nthe Sisters at the clinic to discuss their medical opinions with their patients and offer \nmedical advice freely. And Section 1557 would pressure the Sacred Heart clinic and \nthe Sisters who own and operate it to reject a binary view of gender, which is contrary \nto their medical judgment and religious beliefs. \n2.  Compulsory Insurance Coverage \n119.  The Sacred Heart clinic offers health benefits to eligible employees who \nwork for the clinic.  \n120.  It would violate the religious beliefs of the Sacred Heart clinic and the \nSisters who own and operate it if they were forced to offer a health plan that included \nbenefits for abortions, sterilizations, or any drugs or procedures related to gender \ntransition. Yet HHS’s novel interpretations of Section 1557 will require them to offer \nan insurance plan that includes these health benefits.  \n29 \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 95   Filed 11/23/20   Page 30 of 70\n121.  The Sacred Heart clinic and the Sisters who own and operate it sincerely \nbelieve that providing insurance coverage for gender transition, sterilization, and \nabortion would constitute impermissible material cooperation with evil. The Sacred \nHeart clinic must now choose between (a) following its faith and its best medical judg-\nment, or (b) following Section 1557 as interpreted in the 2016 and 2020 Rules. If it \nfollows its faith and medical judgment, the Sacred Heart clinic will be subject to fi-\nnancial penalties and lawsuits. Most significantly, a significant portion of the pa-\ntients served by the Sacred Heart clinic are poor, disabled, and elderly Medicare and \nMedicaid patients. If the Sacred Heart clinic refuses to both deny its faith and lower \nits standard of care, it risks losing that funding and suffering a crippling blow to its \ncapacity to carry out its religious mission to serve the poor, disabled, and elderly.  \nG. The Effect on SMP Health System \n122.  The Sisters of Mary of the Presentation were founded in France in 1828 \nfor the purpose of teaching children and serving the sick, disabled, and elderly. In \n1903, fleeing religious persecution in France, the Sisters arrived in the United States \nand began a school in Wild Rice, North Dakota and a hospital in Spring Valley, Illi-\nnois. The Sisters of Mary of the Presentation now have a Provincial home in Valley \nCity, North Dakota, and operate three critical access hospitals in North Dakota, in \naddition to the original hospital in Spring Valley. The Sisters also operate five nurs-\ning homes to serve the elderly in North Dakota. Together, these ministries constitute \nSMP Health System.  \n123.  SMP Health System shares the religious beliefs of its sponsor, the Sis-\nters of Mary of the Presentation. The mission of SMP Health System is to “provide[] \nleadership to its Catholic health care ministries as they work to fulfill the healing \nmission of Jesus.” SMP Health System’s vision statement explains that “Our concern \nis for all people, but the poor and elderly have a special claim on us. From our limited \n30 \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 95   Filed 11/23/20   Page 31 of 70\nresources we provide services characterized by excellence, compassion, and personal-\nized concern. Because we care, we focus on the needs of the whole person, which in-\ncludes their physical, spiritual, psychological, and social well-bring.” See SMP Health \nSystem, Mission, Values, Vision and Philosophy, https://perma.cc/WT9T-WL3Y.  \n124.  In accordance with this vision and mission, the Sisters of Mary operate \ntheir clinics in a manner that abides by The Ethical and Religious Directives for Cath-\nolic Healthcare Services, as promulgated by the United States Conference of Catholic \nBishops and interpreted by the local Bishop. The Sisters of Mary strive to “provide \nquality patient care in an environment that contributes to the healing of the whole \nperson.” \n125.  HHS’s new interpretations of Section 1557 will impact SMP Health Sys-\ntem by 1) requiring SMP Health System to offer medical services that violate its best \nmedical judgment and religious beliefs, and 2) requiring SMP Health System to pro-\nvide insurance coverage for services that violate its religious beliefs.  \n1.  Compulsory Medical Services \n126.  SMP Health System provides all of its standard medical services to \nevery individual who needs and qualifies for its care, including to individuals who \nidentify as transgender. Thus, for instance, if a transgender individual comes in with \nhigh blood pressure or a diabetes diagnosis, SMP Health System would provide the \nsame full spectrum of compassionate care for that individual as they provide for every \nother patient. And, just as they do for every other patient, SMP Health System would \nappropriately tailor that care to the biologically sex-specific health needs of the pa-\ntient.  \n127.  SMP Health System holds religious beliefs that sexual identity is an ob-\njective fact rooted in nature as male or female persons. Like the Catholic Church it \nserves, SMP Health System believes that every man and woman is created in the \n31 \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 95   Filed 11/23/20   Page 32 of 70\nimage and likeness of God and that they reflect God’s image in unique—and uniquely \ndignified—ways.  \n128.  In SMP Health System’s best medical judgment, providing or assisting \nwith gender transition services is not in keeping with the best interests of its patients.  \n129.  Providing such services would also substantially burden the religious \nexercise of SMP Health System.  \n130.  Accordingly, after careful review of the issue, SMP Health System made \nthe decision not to provide, perform, or otherwise facilitate medical transitions. To \nprovide or otherwise facilitate those services would also violate SMP Health System’s \nreligious beliefs.  \n131.  The SMP Health System physicians and facilities offer services such as \nhysterectomies, mastectomies, endocrinology services, and psychiatric support. SMP \nHealth System physicians also offer endocrinology services to pediatric patients in \ncertain contexts. The new interpretations of Section 1557 would force SMP Health \nSystem physicians to offer these services as a part of a medical transition, which \nwould violate both their best medical judgment and their religious beliefs.  \n132.  Section 1557 also chills the speech of SMP Health System physicians \nwho wish to discuss their medical opinions with their patients and offer medical ad-\nvice freely.  \n133.  Some of the procedures required under Section 1557 and the relevant \n2016 and 2020 Rules, including elective hysterectomies, can result in the sterilization \nof the patient. Since SMP Health System does not believe hysterectomies for the pur-\npose of gender transition are medically necessary, being forced to provide such proce-\ndures would violate SMP Health System’s best medical judgment and religious be-\nliefs.  \n134.  The 2016 Rule also prohibits discrimination on the basis of “termination \nof pregnancy.” In certain contexts, SMP Health System performs surgical procedures \n32 \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 95   Filed 11/23/20   Page 33 of 70\nfor women who have miscarried a baby, such as dilation and curettage (D&C) proce-\ndures. However, SMP Health System would be unwilling to offer the same service if \nthe goal of the procedure was to terminate a pregnancy. The Rule forces SMP Health \nSystem to provide abortion-related procedures in violation of its best medical judg-\nment and religious beliefs. \n  2.   Compulsory Insurance Coverage \n135.  SMP Health System offers health benefits to its full-time employees.  \n136.  SMP Health System offers its employees a self-insured plan in Illinois, \nadministered by a third-party administrator, and a fully insured plan in North Da-\nkota.  \n137.  In accordance with SMP Health System’s religious beliefs, the employee \nbenefits plans specifically exclude coverage for gender transition surgeries and treat-\nment leading to and/or related to such surgeries; sterilizations; and abortions. \n138.  SMP Health System sincerely believes that providing insurance cover-\nage for gender transition, sterilization, and abortion would constitute impermissible \nmaterial cooperation with evil.  \n139.  SMP Health System must now choose between (a) following its faith and \nits best medical judgment, or (b) following HHS’s novel interpretations of Section \n1557. If it follows its faith and medical judgment, SMP Health System will be subject \nto financial penalties and lawsuits. Most significantly, SMP Health System annually \nprovides a substantial amount of services to poor, disabled, and elderly Medicare and \nMedicaid patients. If SMP Health System refuses to both deny its faith and lower its \nstandard of care, it risks losing that funding and suffering a crippling blow to its \ncapacity to carry out its religious mission to serve the poor, disabled, and elderly.  \nH. The Effect on University of Mary \n33 \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 95   Filed 11/23/20   Page 34 of 70\n140.  The University of Mary has a long tradition of carrying out the mission \nof Jesus Christ through education. In 1878, a brave group of Benedictine Sisters ar-\nrived  in  Dakota  Territory  to bring  ministries  of  healing  and learning, founding \nschools and hospitals to serve the community.  \n141.  In 1959, the Benedictine Sisters of the Annunciation founded Mary Col-\nlege, offering degrees in education and nursing.  The college expanded and added \nadditional programs. In the 1980s, it added its first graduate program, in nursing, \nand became the University of Mary.  \n142.  The University strives to infuse all of its programs with Christian, Cath-\nolic, Benedictine values to prepare its students to be ethical leaders in their careers \nand their communities. The University welcomes students of all faiths and back-\ngrounds and, as is fundamental to its mission, upholds Catholic teaching in all of its \nprograms and services.  \n143.  The University has a long history of offering medical education inspired \nby its Catholic faith. For example, the University is one of only a few in the United \nStates to offer a master’s degree in bioethics, designed to help professionals make \nmorally sound decisions about responsible use of biomedical advances. The program \nis offered in partnership with the National Catholic Bioethics Center. \n144.  As it has since its founding, the University offers a nursing program. It \nprovides several nursing degrees at the undergraduate, graduate and doctoral level. \nIn June 2016, the University’s nursing program on June 17, 2016 received a three-\nyear grant for over $1 million from the Department of Health and Human Services. \nThat grant is intended to aid in training nurses to improve rural healthcare in North \nDakota.  The University expects to continue partnering with the Department of \nHealth and Human Services in the future. \n34 \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 95   Filed 11/23/20   Page 35 of 70\n145.  The University also has a student health clinic that operates in accord-\nance with the Ethical and Religious Directives of the United States Conference of \nCatholic Bishops. \n146.  As a result of the receipt of funds administered by HHS, the University \nis subject to the new interpretation of Section 1557.  \n147.  The University has 396 employees who are eligible for health insurance \nbenefits from the University.  \n148.  The University operates a self-funded health plan which provides cover-\nage for its employees through a third-party administrator. The same plan provides \ncoverage for all employees, whether in the nursing program or outside the nursing \nprogram.  \n149.  In keeping with the University’s Catholic beliefs, that plan excludes cov-\nerage for: “Treatment leading to or in connection with sex change or transformation \nsurgery and related complications”; sterilization; and abortion. \n150.  The University sincerely believes that providing insurance coverage for \ngender transitions, sterilization, or abortion would constitute impermissible mate-\nrial cooperation with evil.  \n151.  The University must now choose between (a) following its faith, or (b) \nfollowing HHS’s novel interpretations of Section 1557. If it follows its faith, the Uni-\nversity will be subject to financial penalties and lawsuits, including loss of HHS fund-\ning, jeopardizing its religious mission to serve the religious, academic, and cultural \nneeds of its students and the people of its region.  \n152.  The new interpretations of Section 1557 also make it more expensive for \nthe University to do business with its third-party administrator. The Regulation sub-\njects the third-party administrator to potential liability for administering the Univer-\n35 \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 95   Filed 11/23/20   Page 36 of 70\nsity’s religious health plan, and thus the University will likely be required to indem-\nnify its third-party administrator from this liability. This constitutes an additional \nsubstantial burden on its religious exercise.  \nI.  The Effect on North Dakota \n153.  HHS’s new interpretation of Section 1557 runs headlong into estab-\nlished standards of medical care, usurps North Dakota’s legitimate authority over its \nmedical facilities, and makes it impossible for North Dakota to comply with conflict-\ning federal law, among other harms.   \n1.  Standard of Care \n154.  “[T]he State has a significant role to play in regulating the medical pro-\nfession,” Gonzales v. Carhart, 550 U.S. 124, 157 (2007), as well as “an interest in \nprotecting the integrity and ethics of the medical profession.” Washington v. Glucks-\nberg, 521 U.S. 702, 731 (1997). This includes “maintaining high standards of profes-\nsional conduct” in the practice of medicine. Barsky v. Bd. of Regents of Univ., 347 U.S. \n442, 451 (1954). \n155.  North Dakota, for example, actively protects the physician-patient rela-\ntionship and the ability of doctors to exercise independent medical judgment in ser-\nvice of their patients.  \n156.  Every person should be treated with dignity and respect, especially \nwhen in need of medical attention. The standard of care established in North Dakota, \nand around the country, enables patients to obtain quality healthcare as determined \nby medical professionals, and not those outside the doctor-patient relationship. The \nnew interpretations of Section 1557, however, usurp this standard of care. It discards \nindependent medical judgment and a physician’s duty to his or her patient’s perma-\nnent well-being and replaces them with rigid commands.  \n36 \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 95   Filed 11/23/20   Page 37 of 70\n157.  As newly interpreted, Section 1557 will force physicians who accept \nMedicare and Medicaid payments and who operate, offer, or contract for health pro-\ngrams and activities that receive Federal financial assistance to subject their patients \nto procedures that permanently alter or remove well-functioning organs, even though \nthe physicians’ independent medical judgment advises against such a course of ac-\ntion. And beyond compelling physicians to act against their medical judgment, Sec-\ntion 1557 requires them to express opinions contrary to what they deem to be in the \npatient’s best interest or to avoid even describing medical transition procedures as \nrisky or experimental. Patients deserve better—and are treated more humanely—\nunder State law.    \n2.  Control over Facilities \n158.  States routinely provide healthcare services directly to citizens through \nvarious mechanisms of government. North Dakota, for example, provides health ser-\nvices through the North Dakota Department of Human Services, which, among other \nthings, operates the North Dakota State Hospital, a state-run hospital that accepts \nHHS-administered funds. \n159.  These covered entities, which exist across the country, will now be cov-\nered under HHS’s new interpretations of Section 1557 with respect to “all of the op-\nerations” of such entities. Thus, these entities will have to offer all manner of (and \nreferrals for) medical transition procedures and treatments. As a result, North Da-\nkota will be forced to allocate personnel, resources, and facility spaces to offer and \naccommodate the myriad medical transition procedures now required to be performed \nunder Section 1557. Healthcare facilities will also be required to open up sex-sepa-\nrated showers, locker rooms, or other facilities based on individual preference. This \nis true even in controlled medical locations where patient access to intimate facilities \nis often under the control of healthcare professionals that are supposed to act in the \nbest interests of the patient. Thus, the new requirements of Section 1557 amount to \n37 \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 95   Filed 11/23/20   Page 38 of 70\na substantial interference in the control that North Dakota and other States legiti-\nmately exercise over their healthcare facilities.  \n3.  Conflicting Federal Law \n160.  Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (“Title VII”) prohibits employ-\nment discrimination based on religion. 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2. To comply with Title VII, \nemployers must reasonably accommodate an employee’s religious belief, observance, \nor practice unless such accommodation imposes an undue hardship on the employer’s \nbusiness. Id. at § 2000e-1; EEOC v. Abercrombie & Fitch Stores, Inc., 135 S. Ct. 2028, \n2032 (2015) (providing that Title VII requires reasonable religious accommodations).  \n161.  But HHS’s new interpretations of Section 1557 in many circumstances \nmake such accommodation illegal, placing employers between a legal Scylla and Cha-\nrybdis. On the one hand, employers are required under Title VII to reasonably ac-\ncommodate their employees’ religious and conscientious objections. On the other \nhand, the Regulation requires medical employers to provide (or refer for) medical \ntransition procedures even when doing so would violate the religious or conscientious \nobjections or concerns of its employees. Thus, it forces employers like North Dakota \nto choose between violating the Regulation or violating Title VII.  \n4.  Additional Harms \n162.  The Regulation is costly and burdensome on North Dakota for a variety \nof additional reasons, to wit:  \n163.  North Dakota operates as an employer that offers covered health bene-\nfits to its employees and their families through its constituent agencies. HHS’s inter-\npretation of Section 1557 will require North Dakota to provide insurance coverage for \nmedical transition procedures.  \n164.  As interpreted by HHS, Section 1557 also purports to require North Da-\nkota to provide abortion coverage through its employee health benefits. HHS states \nthat a State’s Medicaid program constitutes a covered “health program or activity” \n38 \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 95   Filed 11/23/20   Page 39 of 70\nunder the 2016 Rule. Thus, “the State will be governed by Section 1557 in the provi-\nsion of employee health benefits for its Medicaid employees.” 81 Fed. Reg. at 31,437.  \n165.  The exclusions North Dakota currently possesses in its employee insur-\nance policies related to pregnancy termination and medical transition procedures will \nnow be illegal under the Section 1557. As a result, North Dakota will be required to \nchange its insurance coverage.  \n166.  The costs of personnel training will be significant, even by HHS’s very \nmodest estimates. HHS estimates that 7,637,306 state workers will need to receive \ntraining under the 2016 Rule, and that the cost of this training in the first two years \nof implementation alone will be $17.8 million.  \n167.  The penalties for noncompliance are so severe as to make HHS’s new \nregulations coercive. North Dakota, as an example, faces the loss of significant finan-\ncial support in healthcare funding to serve its most vulnerable citizens.  \n168.  Finally, Section 1557 could subject North Dakota to private lawsuits for \ndamages and attorney’s fees, even though North Dakota did not and could not have \nknown or consented to this waiver of its sovereign immunity.  \nJ.  Procedural History \n169.  Plaintiffs filed this lawsuit on November 7, 2016. ECF No. 1. \n170.  Plaintiffs alleged that Defendants’ interpretation of the ACA would re-\nquire them to perform and provide insurance coverage for gender transitions and \nabortions in contravention of their religious beliefs and medical judgment, and that \nDefendants’  actions  therefore  violated  the  Religious  Freedom  Restoration  Act \n(RFRA), the First, Fifth, Tenth, and Eleventh Amendments, the Spending Clause, \nand the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). \n171.  Plaintiffs  Catholic  Benefits  Association,  Diocese  of  Fargo,  Catholic \nCharities North Dakota, and Catholic Medical Association (CBA Plaintiffs) filed their \nlawsuit on December 28, 2016. Catholic Benefits Assoc. et al. v. Burwell et al., No. 16-\n39 \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 95   Filed 11/23/20   Page 40 of 70\ncv-432, ECF No. 1 (D.N.D. filed Dec. 28, 2016). Catholic Benefits Association Plain-\ntiffs also alleged that Defendant EEOC’s interpretation and enforcement of Title VII \nwas illegal for similar reasons. \n172.  On December 30, 2016, this Court issued an order staying enforcement \nof the 2016 Rule against Plaintiffs. ECF No. 23.  \n173.  On January 23, 2017, this Court consolidated Plaintiffs’ lawsuit and the \nlawsuit brought by the Catholic Benefits Association Plaintiffs. ECF No. 37. \n174.  On January 23, 2017, the Court also amended its December 30 order “to \nmake clear that it temporarily stays enforcement, as to the named Plaintiffs, of Sec-\ntion 1557’s prohibitions against discrimination on the bases of gender identity and \ntermination of pregnancy.” ECF No. 36.  \n175.  The Court noted that the Franciscan Alliance court had issued a nation-\nwide preliminary injunction prohibiting HHS from enforcing the 2016 Rule, id. at 1, \nand that the Court found “the order issued in Franciscan Alliance to be thorough and \nwell-reasoned.” Id. at 2. \n176.  On May 26, 2017, Defendants filed a motion for voluntary remand and \nstay. ECF No. 45. Defendants requested “the opportunity to reconsider the regulation \nat issue ... based in part on the Administration’s desire to assess the reasonableness, \nnecessity, and efficacy” of the 2016 Rule and “to address certain issues identified by \n[the Franciscan Alliance] federal district court in granting a preliminary injunction \nagainst those aspects of the regulation.” Id. at 1.  \n177.  The parties then submitted briefs concerning the propriety of a stay or \nremand. ECF Nos. 46, 50, 51, 52, 53. \n178.  On August 24, 2017, the Court granted Defendants’ motion for a stay \nand denied the motion for remand. ECF No. 56. The Court held that “a stay is war-\nranted AND appropriate so that the agency can revisit Section 1557 of the Affordable \nCare Act.” Id. at 2. The Court also held that the consolidated cases would “be stayed \n40 \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 95   Filed 11/23/20   Page 41 of 70\nin all respects until further Order of the Court in order to allow HHS to reconsider \nthe controversial rules and regulations at issue.” Id. \n179.  Following the Supreme Court’s decision in Bostock and the district court \ndecisions enjoining the 2020 Rule and purporting to revive the vacated 2016 Rule, \nPlaintiffs concluded that they faced the imminent threat that Section 1557 would be \nenforced against them to require them to violate their sincerely held religious beliefs. \n180.  On November 6, 2020, Plaintiffs filed an unopposed motion to lift the \nstay and to set a briefing schedule for filing amended complaints and responses to the \namended complaints. ECF No. 92. \n181.  On November 9, 2020, the Court granted the parties’ motion. ECF No. \n93. \nIV. CLAIMS \nCOUNT I \nViolation of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act \nCompelled Medical Services \n182.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference all preceding paragraphs. \n183.  RFRA provides “very broad protection for religious liberty.” Burwell v. \nHobby Lobby Stores, Inc., 573 U.S. 682, 693 (2014). It does so by “operat[ing] as a kind \nof super statute, displacing the normal operation of other federal laws.” Bostock, 140 \nS. Ct. at 1754. \n184.  Under RFRA, “Government shall not substantially burden a person’s \nexercise of religion” unless “it demonstrates that application of the burden to the per-\nson” “(1) is in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest; and (2) is the least \nrestrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental interest.” 42 U.S.C. § \n2000bb-1(a)-(b). \n185.  If the government’s application of a law burdens a person’s exercise of \nreligion, and the government cannot satisfy the compelling interest/least restrictive \n41 \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 95   Filed 11/23/20   Page 42 of 70\nmeans test, the person “is entitled to an exemption.” Hobby Lobby, 573 U.S. at 694-\n95. \n186.  The Religious Plaintiffs’ sincerely held religious beliefs prohibit them \nfrom deliberately offering services and performing (or referring for) medical transi-\ntion procedures, sterilization procedures, and abortion-related services. Plaintiffs’ \ncompliance with these beliefs is a religious exercise.  \n187.  HHS’s interpretation of Section 1557 to require covered entities to per-\nform these services substantially burdens Plaintiffs’ religious exercise by placing gov-\nernment-imposed coercive pressure on Plaintiffs to change or violate their beliefs. \n188.  Specifically, if Plaintiffs continue to provide medical care in compliance \nwith their religious beliefs, HHS’s interpretation of Section 1557 exposes them to, \namong other harms: \n(a)  the loss of substantial government funding;  \n(b)  substantial penalties under the False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. § \n3729 et seq.; \n(c)  criminal penalties under 18 U.S.C. § 1035; and \n(d)  civil suits that would hold Plaintiffs liable for practicing their be-\nliefs. \n189.  HHS’s interpretation of Section 1557 thus imposes a substantial burden \non Plaintiffs’ religious exercise.  \n190.  HHS’s interpretation of Section 1557 furthers no compelling governmen-\ntal interest. Gender-transition procedures are intensely controversial in the medical \ncommunity, with many sharing Plaintiffs’ belief that those procedures are often \nharmful. As HHS now recognizes, “there is no medical consensus to support one or \nanother form of treatment for gender dysphoria,” much less a compelling reason to \nrequire objecting healthcare providers to provide such treatments. 85 Fed. Reg. at \n37,198.  \n42 \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 95   Filed 11/23/20   Page 43 of 70\n191.  Nor is HHS’s interpretation of Section 1557 the least restrictive means \nof furthering Defendants’ interests. If the government wishes to expand access to \ntransition and abortion procedures, it has numerous means at its disposal other than \ncompelling objecting providers to perform the procedures, including itself “assist[ing] \ntransgender individuals in finding and paying for transition procedures available \nfrom the growing number of healthcare providers who offer and specialize in those \nservices.” Franciscan All., 227 F. Supp. 3d at 693.  \n192.  HHS’s interpretation of Section 1557 thus violates Plaintiffs’ rights se-\ncured to them by RFRA.  \nCOUNT II \nViolation of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act \nCompelled Insurance Coverage  \n193.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference all preceding paragraphs.  \n194.  For the same reasons discussed above, Plaintiffs’ sincerely held religious \nbeliefs prohibit them from deliberately offering health insurance that would cover \ngender  transition  procedures,  sterilization  procedures,  or  abortion-related  proce-\ndures.   \n195.  Plaintiffs specifically exclude coverage of any services related to gender \ntransition  procedures,  sterilization  procedures,  or  abortion-related  procedures  in \ntheir insurance plans.  \n196.  Plaintiffs’ compliance with these beliefs by maintaining these exclusions \nis a religious exercise.  \n197.  HHS’s interpretation of Section 1557 to require covered entities to pro-\nvide insurance coverage for these procedures substantially burdens Plaintiffs’ reli-\ngious  exercise  by  placing  government-imposed  coercive  pressure  on  Plaintiffs  to \nchange or violate their beliefs. \n43 \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 95   Filed 11/23/20   Page 44 of 70\n198.  Specifically, HHS’s interpretation of Section 1557 exposes the Plaintiffs \nto the loss of substantial government funding as a result of their religious exercise.  \n199.  HHS’s interpretation of Section 1557 also makes it much more expen-\nsive for the Plaintiffs to do business with a third party administrator for a health \nbenefits plan. HHS’s interpretation of Section 1557 subjects third party administra-\ntors to potential liability for administering religious health plans like Plaintiffs’, and \nthus Plaintiffs will be forced to indemnify any third party administrator from this \nliability. This constitutes an additional substantial burden on Plaintiffs’ religious ex-\nercise.    \n200.  HHS’s interpretation of Section 1557 also exposes Plaintiffs to, among \nother harms: \n(a) substantial penalties under the False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. § 3729 \net seq.; \n(b)  criminal penalties under 18 U.S.C. § 1035; \n(c) civil suits that would hold Plaintiffs liable for practicing their beliefs. \n201.  HHS’s interpretation of Section 1557 thus imposes a substantial burden \non Plaintiffs’ religious exercise.  \n202.  HHS’s interpretation of Section 1557 furthers no compelling governmen-\ntal interest. Gender-transition procedures are intensely controversial in the medical \ncommunity, with many sharing Plaintiffs’ belief that those procedures are often \nharmful. As HHS now recognizes, “there is no medical consensus to support one or \nanother form of treatment for gender dysphoria,” much less a compelling reason to \nrequire objecting entities to provide insurance coverage for such treatments. 85 Fed. \nReg. at 37,198. \n203.  Nor is HHS’s interpretation of Section 1557 the least restrictive means \nof furthering Defendants’ interests. “If the government wishes to expand access to \ntransition and abortion procedures, ‘[t]he most straightforward way of doing this \n44 \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 95   Filed 11/23/20   Page 45 of 70\nwould be for the government to assume the cost of providing the [procedures] at issue \nto any [individuals] who are unable to obtain them under their health-insurance pol-\nicies due to their employers’ religious objections.” Franciscan All., 227 F. Supp. 3d at \n693.  \n204.  HHS’s interpretation of Section 1557 thus violates Plaintiffs’ rights se-\ncured to them by RFRA.  \nCOUNT III \nViolation of the Administrative Procedure Act \nAgency Action Not in Accordance with Law \n205.  The Plaintiffs incorporate by reference all preceding paragraphs.  \n206.  Defendants are “agencies” under the APA, 5 U.S.C. § 551(1), and the \nSection 1557 Regulations (the 2016 Rule and 2020 Rule) complained of herein are \n“rules” under the APA, id. § 551(4), and constitute “[a]gency action made reviewable \nby statute and final agency action for which there is no other adequate remedy in a \ncourt.” Id. § 704. \n207.  The APA prohibits agency actions that are “not in accordance with law.” \nId. § 706(2)(A). Under the APA, “an agency may not interpret a regulation so as to \nviolate a statute.” Univ. of Iowa Hosps. & Clinics v. Shalala, 180 F.3d 943, 951 (8th \nCir. 1999). In such cases, courts review questions of law de novo. Iowa League of Cities \nv. EPA, 711 F.3d 844, 872 (8th Cir. 2013). The Section 1557 Regulations are not in \naccordance with law for a number of independent reasons.  \n208.  Section 1557 Regulations’ definition of “sex” discrimination to include \ndiscrimination on the basis of “gender identity” and “sex stereotyping” requires phy-\nsicians to perform medical transition procedures regardless of their best medical \njudgment and religious beliefs. It is not in accordance with law, within the meaning \nof 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), for the federal government to require medical professionals to \nperform procedures that may not be necessary or appropriate, and may in fact be \n45 \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 95   Filed 11/23/20   Page 46 of 70\nharmful to the patients. This violates constitutional and statutory rights of medical \nprofessionals, including substantive due process rights and freedom of speech protec-\ntions, as well as the sovereign prerogatives of the States, which play a significant role \nin overseeing the promulgation and administration of appropriate standards of care \nwithin the healthcare community. Courts scrutinize particularly closely agency ac-\ntion that raises constitutional concerns.   \n209.  The 2016 and 2020 Rules are not in accordance with Section 1557 of the \nAffordable Care Act (42 U.S.C. § 18116) or Title IX of the Education Amendments of \n1972, 20 U.S.C. § 1681 et seq. Section 1557 does not, on its own terms, prohibit dis-\ncrimination on the basis of “sex.” Instead, it prohibits discrimination “on the ground \nprohibited  under  ...  title  IX  of  the  Education  Amendments  of  1972.”  42 \nU.S.C. § 18116(a). Title IX, in turn, prohibits discrimination “on the basis of sex ... ex-\ncept that ... this section shall not apply to an educational institution which is con-\ntrolled by a religious organization if the application of this subsection would not be \nconsistent with the religious tenets of such organization.” 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a)-(a)(3). \n210.  Neither Section 1557 nor Title IX uses the term “sex” to include “gender \nidentity” or “sex stereotyping.” Thus, HHS’s attempt to expand the definition is not \nin accordance with law within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). This is true of \nboth the 2016 Rule as well as the 2020 Rule because the 2020 Rule would permit \n“application of the [Bostock] Court’s construction” of “sex” discrimination. 85 Fed. \nReg. at 37,168. \n211.  The Section 1557 Regulations are also not in accordance with law within \nthe meaning of 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A) to the extent they do not incorporate Title IX’s \nreligious exemption.   \n212.  The 2016 Rule and the 2020 Rule are not in accordance with Title VII of \nthe Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. § 2000e et seq.). Title VII prohibits employers \nfrom discriminating against employees on the basis of religion. 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2. \n46 \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 95   Filed 11/23/20   Page 47 of 70\nThis means that employers, including Plaintiffs, have a duty to reasonably accommo-\ndate their employees’ religious practices unless doing so would cause undue hardship \nto the employer. Plaintiffs employ individuals who have religious or conscientious \nobjections to performing medical transition procedures. It should not be an undue \nhardship on Plaintiffs to accommodate these employees’ religious beliefs, but the 2016 \nRule and the 2020 Rule will in many cases make it illegal for Plaintiffs who receive \nHHS funds to accommodate their employees in accordance with Title VII. Thus, the \n2016 Rule and the 2020 Rule are not in accordance with Title VII. \n213.  The 2016 Rule and the 2020 Rule also force physicians to provide medi-\ncal services related to gender transition. This is not in accordance with substantive \ndue process rights protecting a medical professional’s right to not perform a procedure \nhe or she believes to be experimental, ethically questionable, and potentially harmful. \n214.  The 2016 Rule and the 2020 Rule are not in accordance with the First \nAmendment because the Rules are overbroad, vague, and not narrowly tailored to a \ncompelling governmental interest. \n215.  The 2016 Rule and the 2020 Rule are not in accordance with the Tenth \nAmendment, which prohibits the federal government from co-opting a state’s control \nover budgetary processes and legislative agendas. \n216.  The 2016 Rule and the 2020 Rule are contrary to the First Amendment \nbecause they impose an unconstitutional condition on Plaintiffs’ receipt of federal \nfunding. See Agency for Int’l Dev. v. All. for Open Soc’y Int’l, Inc., 133 S. Ct. 2321, \n2331 (2013). \n217.  The 2016 Rule and the 2020 Rule are contrary to law because they vio-\nlate the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. \n218.  The 2016 Rule and the 2020 Rule are contrary to law because they vio-\nlate the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment. \n47 \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 95   Filed 11/23/20   Page 48 of 70\n219.  The 2016 Rule and the 2020 Rule are contrary to law because they vio-\nlate the Fifth Amendment Due Process and Equal Protection clauses. \n220.  The 2016 Rule and the 2020 Rule are contrary to the protections of the \nSpending Clause.  \n221.  The 2016 Rule and the 2020 Rule unlawfully abrogate sovereign immun-\nity under the Eleventh Amendment.  \n222.  The 2016 Rule and the 2020 Rule are contrary to the protections of the \nTenth Amendment.  \n223.  Plaintiffs have no adequate or available administrative remedy, or, in \nthe alternative, any effort to obtain an administrative remedy would be futile. \n224.  Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law. \n225.  Absent injunctive and declaratory relief against the 2016 Rule, the 2020 \nRule, and Section 1557, the Plaintiffs have been and will continue to be harmed. \nCOUNT IV \nViolation of the Administrative Procedure Act \nAgency Action In Excess of Statutory Authority and Limitations \n226.  The Plaintiffs incorporate by reference all preceding paragraphs.  \n227.  Defendants are “agencies” under the APA, 5 U.S.C. § 551(1), and the \nSection  1557  Regulations  complained  of  herein  are  “rules”  under  the  APA, \nid. § 551(4), and constitute “[a]gency action made reviewable by statute and final \nagency action for which there is no other adequate remedy in a court.” Id. § 704. \n228.  The APA prohibits agency actions that are “in excess of statutory juris-\ndiction, authority, or limitations.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(C). The Section 1557 Regulations \nare in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, and limitations for a number of rea-\nsons.  \n229.  For the reasons described above, there is no statutory authority or juris-\ndiction for HHS to require medical professionals and facilities to perform procedures \n48 \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 95   Filed 11/23/20   Page 49 of 70\n(or refer for the same) that may not be necessary or appropriate, and may in fact be \nharmful to the patients.  \n230.  For the reasons described above, there is no statutory authority or juris-\ndiction for HHS to dictate appropriate medical views on the necessity and experi-\nmental nature of medical transition procedures, or to dictate what constitutes best \nstandards of care in an area of science and medicine that is being hotly debated in \nthe medical community. \n231.  For the reasons described above, HHS’s decision to interpret Section \n1557’s reference to “sex” discrimination to include “gender identity” and “sex stereo-\ntyping” is in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, and limitations within the \nmeaning of 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(C).  \n232.  For the reasons described above, HHS’s failure to incorporate Title IX’s \nreligious exemption in the 2016 Rule and the 2020 Rule is in excess of statutory ju-\nrisdiction, authority, and limitations within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(C).  \n233.  For the reasons described above, HHS’s decision to require Plaintiffs to \nact in violation of Title VII by not accommodating their employees’ religious and con-\nscientious objections to participating in (or referring for) medical transition treatment \nor procedures is in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, and limitations within \nthe meaning of 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(C). \n234.  For the reasons discussed above, the 2016 Rule and the 2020 Rule are \nin excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, and limitations within the meaning of 5 \nU.S.C. § 706(2)(C) as they violate Plaintiffs’ freedom of speech. \n235.  For the reasons discussed above, the 2016 Rule and the 2020 Rule are \nin excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, and limitations within the meaning of 5 \nU.S.C. § 706(2)(C) as they violate Plaintiffs’ substantive due process rights.  \n236.  For the reasons discussed above, the 2016 Rule and the 2020 Rule are \nin excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, and limitations within the meaning of 5 \n49 \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 95   Filed 11/23/20   Page 50 of 70\nU.S.C. § 706(2)(C) as they violate the First Amendment because they are overbroad, \nvague, and not narrowly tailored to a compelling governmental interest. \n237.  For the reasons discussed above, the 2016 Rule and the 2020 Rule are \nin excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, and limitations within the meaning of 5 \nU.S.C. § 706(2)(C) because they co-opt states’ control over budgetary processes and \nlegislative agendas contrary to Article I and the Tenth Amendment. \n238.  For the reasons discussed above, the 2016 Rule and the 2020 Rule are \nin excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, and limitations within the meaning of 5 \nU.S.C. § 706(2)(C) because they impose an unconstitutional condition on Plaintiffs’ \nreceipt of federal funding contrary to the First Amendment.  \n239.  For the reasons discussed above, the 2016 Rule and the 2020 Rule are \nin excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, and limitations within the meaning of 5 \nU.S.C. § 706(2)(C) because they violate the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. \n240.  For the reasons discussed above, the 2016 Rule and the 2020 Rule are \nin excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, and limitations within the meaning of 5 \nU.S.C. § 706(2)(C) because they violate the Free Exercise clause of the First Amend-\nment. \n241.  For the reasons discussed above, the 2016 Rule and the 2020 Rule are \nin excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, and limitations within the meaning of 5 \nU.S.C. § 706(2)(C) because they violate the Fifth Amendment Due Process and Equal \nProtection clauses. \n242.  For the reasons discussed above, the 2016 Rule and the 2020 Rule are \nin excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, and limitations within the meaning of 5 \nU.S.C. § 706(2)(C)  because  they  are  contrary  to  the  protections  of  the  Spending \nClause.  \n50 \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 95   Filed 11/23/20   Page 51 of 70\n243.  For the reasons discussed above, the 2016 Rule and the 2020 Rule are \nin excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, and limitations within the meaning of 5 \nU.S.C. § 706(2)(C) because they unlawfully abrogate sovereign immunity.  \n244.  For the reasons discussed above, the 2016 Rule and the 2020 Rule are \nin excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, and limitations within the meaning of 5 \nU.S.C. § 706(2)(C) because they are contrary to the protections of the Tenth Amend-\nment.  \n245.  Plaintiffs have no adequate or available administrative remedy, or, in \nthe alternative, any effort to obtain an administrative remedy would be futile. \n246.  Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law. \n247.  Absent injunctive and declaratory relief against the 2016 Rule, the 2020 \nRule, and Section 1557, the Plaintiffs have been and will continue to be harmed. \nCOUNT V \nViolation of the Administrative Procedure Act \nAgency Action that is Arbitrary, Capricious and an Abuse of Discretion \n248.  The Plaintiffs incorporate by reference all preceding paragraphs.  \n249.  Defendants are “agencies” under the APA, 5 U.S.C. § 551(1), and the \nSection  1557  Regulations  complained  of  herein  are  “rules”  under  the  APA, \nid. § 551(4), and constitute “[a]gency action made reviewable by statute and final \nagency action for which there is no other adequate remedy in a court.” Id. § 704. \n250.  The APA prohibits agency actions that are “arbitrary, capricious, [or] an \nabuse of discretion.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). The Section 1557 Regulations are arbitrary \nand capricious agency actions for a number of reasons.  \n251.  The Section 1557 Regulations’ definition of “sex” discrimination to in-\nclude discrimination on the basis of “gender identity” and “sex stereotyping” requires \nphysicians to perform medical transition procedures regardless of their best medical \n51 \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 95   Filed 11/23/20   Page 52 of 70\njudgment and religious beliefs. It is arbitrary and capricious for the federal govern-\nment to require medical professionals to perform (or refer for) procedures that the \nphysician believes may not be necessary or appropriate, and that may even be harm-\nful to the patient. \n252.  For the reasons discussed above, it is arbitrary and capricious for HHS \nto dictate appropriate medical views on the necessity and experimental nature of \nmedical transition procedures, and to dictate what constitutes best standards of care. \n253.  For the reasons discussed above, HHS’s inclusion of “gender identity” \nand “sex stereotyping” in its interpretation of “sex” is an arbitrary and capricious \ninterpretation of Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act (42 U.S.C. § 18116) and Title \nIX of the Education Amendments of 1972, 20 U.S.C. § 1681 et seq.  \n254.  For the reasons discussed above, HHS’s failure to include Title IX’s reli-\ngious exemption in the Section 1557 Regulations is arbitrary and capricious within \nthe meaning of 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).  \n255.  For the reasons described above, HHS’s decision to require Plaintiffs to \nact in violation of Title VII by not accommodating their employees’ religious objec-\ntions to participating in medical transition procedures is arbitrary and capricious \nwithin the meaning of 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \n256.  For the reasons discussed above, the 2016 Rule and the 2020 Rule are \narbitrary and capricious within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A) as they violate \nPlaintiffs’ freedom of speech. \n257.  For the reasons discussed above, the 2016 Rule and the 2020 Rule are \narbitrary and capricious within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A) as they violate \nPlaintiffs’ substantive due process rights.  \n258.  For the reasons discussed above, the 2016 Rule and the 2020 Rule are \narbitrary and capricious within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A) as they violate \n52 \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 95   Filed 11/23/20   Page 53 of 70\nthe First Amendment because they are overbroad, vague, and not narrowly tailored \nto a compelling governmental interest. \n259.  For the reasons discussed above, the 2016 Rule and the 2020 Rule are \narbitrary and capricious within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A) because they co-\nopt States’ control over budgetary processes and legislative agendas contrary to the \nTenth Amendment. \n260.  For the reasons discussed above, the 2016 Rule and the 2020 Rule are \narbitrary and capricious within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A) because they im-\npose an unconstitutional condition on Plaintiffs’ receipt of federal funding contrary to \nthe First Amendment.  \n261.  For the reasons discussed above, the 2016 Rule and the 2020 Rule are \narbitrary and capricious within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A) because they vi-\nolate the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. \n262.  For the reasons discussed above, the 2016 Rule and the 2020 Rule are \narbitrary and capricious within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A) because they vi-\nolate the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment. \n263.  For the reasons discussed above, the 2016 Rule and the 2020 Rule are \narbitrary and capricious within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A) because they vi-\nolate the Fifth Amendment Due Process and Equal Protection clauses. \n264.  For the reasons discussed above, the 2016 Rule and the 2020 Rule are \narbitrary and capricious within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A) because they are \ncontrary to the protections of the Spending Clause.  \n265.  For the reasons discussed above, the 2016 Rule and the 2020 Rule are \narbitrary and capricious within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A) because they un-\nlawfully abrogate sovereign immunity.  \n53 \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 95   Filed 11/23/20   Page 54 of 70\n266.  For the reasons discussed above, the 2016 Rule and the 2020 Rule are \narbitrary and capricious within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A) because they are \ncontrary to the protections of the Tenth Amendment.  \n267.  Plaintiffs have no adequate or available administrative remedy, or, in \nthe alternative, any effort to obtain an administrative remedy would be futile. \n268.  Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law. \n269.  Absent injunctive and declaratory relief against the 2016 Rule, the 2020 \nRule, and Section 1557, the Plaintiffs have been and will continue to be harmed. \nCOUNT VI \nViolation of the First Amendment of the United States Constitution \nFreedom of Speech \nCompelled Speech and Compelled Silence \n270.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference all preceding paragraphs. \n271.  Plaintiffs plan to continue using their best medical and ethical judgment \nin treating and advising patients. Performing (or referring for) medical transition \nprocedures is contrary to their best medical and/or ethical judgment.  \n272.  The 2016 Rule states, in the context of physicians offering “health ser-\nvices” that a “categorization of all transition-related treatment ... as experimental, is \noutdated and not based on current standards of care.” 81 Fed. Reg. at 31,435; see also \nid. at 31,429.  \n273.  Because two courts have enjoined relevant portions of the 2020 Rule and \nheld that the 2016 Rule remains in effect as to “gender identity” and “sex stereotyp-\ning” discrimination, Plaintiffs face a substantial risk of enforcement under the 2016 \nRule. Additionally, Plaintiffs also face a substantial risk of enforcement because one \nother court has held that the 2020 Rule itself prohibits “gender identity” discrimina-\ntion similar to the 2016 Rule. \n54 \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 95   Filed 11/23/20   Page 55 of 70\n274.  HHS’s interpretation of Section 1557 would prohibit the Plaintiffs from \nexpressing their professional opinions that medical transition procedures are not the \nbest standard of care or are experimental. \n275.  HHS’s interpretation of Section 1557 would also require Plaintiffs to \namend their written policies to expressly endorse gender transition procedures, even \nif such revisions do not reflect the medical judgment, values, or beliefs of Plaintiffs. \nId. at 31,455. HHS’s interpretation of Section 1557 would also require Plaintiffs to \nuse gender-transition affirming language in all situations, regardless of circum-\nstance. Id. at 31,406.  \n276.  Performing (or referring for) medical transition procedures is also con-\ntrary to the religious and conscientious beliefs of the Plaintiffs, and their beliefs pro-\nhibit them from conducting, participating in, or referring for such procedures.  \n277.  HHS’s interpretation of Section 1557 would compel the Plaintiffs to con-\nduct, participate in, refer for, or otherwise facilitate medical transition procedures.  \n278.  HHS’s interpretation of Section 1557 would prohibit the Plaintiffs from \nexpressing their religious views that medical transition procedures are not the best \nstandard of care or are experimental.  \n279.  HHS’s interpretation of Section 1557 would compel the Plaintiffs to \nspeak in ways that they would not otherwise speak.  \n280.  HHS’s interpretation of Section 1557 thus violates the Plaintiffs right to \nbe free from compelled speech as secured to them by the First Amendment of the \nUnited States Constitution.  \n281.  HHS’s interpretation of Section 1557 would compel speech and is not \njustified by a compelling governmental interest.  \n282.  Even if HHS has a compelling government interest, HHS’s interpreta-\ntion of Section 1557 is not narrowly tailored to achieve that interest.  \n55 \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 95   Filed 11/23/20   Page 56 of 70\n283.  Absent injunctive and declaratory relief against HHS’s interpretation of \nSection 1557 and Section 1557, the Plaintiffs have been and will continue to be \nharmed.  \nCOUNT VII \nViolation of the First Amendment of the United States Constitution \nFreedom of Speech and Free Exercise Clause \nViewpoint Discrimination \n284.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference all preceding paragraphs.  \n285.  Plaintiffs’ sincere religious and conscientious beliefs prohibit them from \nfacilitating or participating in medical transition procedures.  \n286.  Plaintiffs’ medical judgment is that, in general, it is harmful to encour-\nage a patient to undergo medical transition procedures.  \n287.  The 2016 Rule states, in the context of physicians offering “health ser-\nvices” that a “categorization of all transition-related treatment, for example as exper-\nimental, is outdated and not based on current standards of care.” 81 Fed. Reg. at \n31,435; see also id. at 31,429.  \n288.  Because two courts have enjoined relevant portions of the 2020 Rule and \nheld that the 2016 Rule remains in effect as to “gender identity” and “sex stereotyp-\ning” discrimination, Plaintiffs face a substantial risk of enforcement under the 2016 \nRule. Additionally, Plaintiffs also face a substantial risk of enforcement because one \nother court has held that the 2020 Rule itself prohibits “gender identity” discrimina-\ntion similar to the 2016 Rule. \n289.  HHS’s interpretation of Section 1557 would prohibit the Plaintiffs from \nexpressing their religious or conscientious viewpoint that medical transition proce-\ndures are not the best standard of care.  \n290.  HHS’s interpretation of Section 1557 withholds funding based on an in-\ntent to restrict Plaintiffs’ speech.  \n56 \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 95   Filed 11/23/20   Page 57 of 70\n291.  HHS’s interpretation of Section 1557 would discriminate based on view-\npoint and is not justified by a compelling governmental interest.  \n292.  Even if HHS has a compelling government interest, HHS’s interpreta-\ntion of Section 1557 is not narrowly tailored to achieve that interest.  \n293.  Defendants’ actions thus violate the Plaintiffs’ rights as secured to them \nby the First Amendment of the United States Constitution.  \n294.  Absent injunctive and declaratory relief against HHS’s interpretation of \nSection 1557 and Section 1557, the Plaintiffs have been and will continue to be \nharmed.  \nCOUNT VIII \nViolation of the First and Fifth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution \nFreedom of Speech and Due Process \nOverbreadth and Vagueness \n295.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference all preceding paragraphs.  \n296.  HHS’s interpretation of Section 1557 regulates protected speech.  \n297.  The 2016 Rule states, in the context of physicians offering “health ser-\nvices” that a “categorization of all transition-related treatment ... as experimental, is \noutdated and not based on current standards of care.” 81 Fed. Reg. at 31,435; see also \nid. at 31,429.  \n298.  Because two courts have enjoined relevant portions of the 2020 Rule and \nheld that the 2016 Rule remains in effect as to “gender identity” and “sex stereotyp-\ning” discrimination, Plaintiffs face a substantial risk of enforcement under the 2016 \nRule. Additionally, Plaintiffs also face a substantial risk of enforcement because one \nother court has held that the 2020 Rule itself prohibits “gender identity” discrimina-\ntion similar to the 2016 Rule. \n299.  This exposes the Plaintiffs to penalties for expressing their medical and \nmoral views of medical transition procedures. It also prohibits Plaintiffs from using \n57 \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 95   Filed 11/23/20   Page 58 of 70\ntheir medical judgment to determine the appropriate standard of care for interactions \nwith their patients.  \n300.  Plaintiffs believe that HHS’s interpretation of Section 1557 restricts \ntheir speech regarding the best standard of care for patients.  \n301.  The 2016 Rule states: “The determination of whether a certain practice \nis discriminatory typically requires a nuanced analysis that is fact-dependent.” Id. at \n31,377. \n302.  The 2016 Rule also requires that a covered entity apply “neutral, non-\ndiscriminatory criteria that it uses for other conditions when the coverage determi-\nnation is related to gender transition” and “decline[s] to limit application of the rule \nby specifying that coverage for the health services addressed in § 92.207(b)(3)-(5) \nmust be provided only when the services are medically necessary or medically appro-\npriate.” 81 Fed. Reg. at 31,435.  \n303.  Without allowing Plaintiffs to use their judgment about what is medi-\ncally necessary or appropriate, the Regulation is ambiguous in the types of services \nPlaintiffs are required to provide and perform.  \n304.  Requiring the Plaintiffs apply “neutral, nondiscriminatory criteria that \nit uses for other conditions” is a subjective standard without a limiting construction. \nId.  \n305.  The Regulation states, in the context of physicians offering “health ser-\nvices” that a “categorization of all transition-related treatment, for example as exper-\nimental, is outdated and not based on current standards of care.” Id.; see also id. at \n31,429.  \n306.  The Regulation does not provide a limiting construction for what the \ncurrent standard of care is, nor does it provide guidance as to how physicians can rely \non their best medical judgment when it conflicts with the Regulation.    \n58 \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 95   Filed 11/23/20   Page 59 of 70\n307.  HHS’s vague and overbroad interpretation of Section 1557 chills the \nPlaintiffs’ speech.  \n308.  HHS’s vague and overbroad interpretation of Section 1557 is not justi-\nfied by a compelling governmental interest.  \n309.  Even if HHS has a compelling government interest, HHS’s interpreta-\ntion of Section 1557 is not narrowly tailored to achieve that interest.  \n310.  Defendants have therefore violated the Plaintiffs’ rights secured to them \nby the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment and the Due Process Clause of \nthe Fifth Amendment by prohibiting speech that would otherwise be protected.  \n311.  Because Plaintiffs are unable to determine what kind of procedures and \nservices they will be required to provide and perform, Defendants have violated the \nPlaintiffs’ rights secured to them by the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment \nand the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.  \n312.  Absent injunctive and declaratory relief against HHS’s interpretation of \nSection 1557 and Section 1557, the Plaintiffs have been and will continue to be \nharmed.  \nCOUNT IX \nViolation of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution \nFree Speech Clause \nUnconstitutional Conditions \n313.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference all preceding paragraphs.  \n314.  HHS’s interpretation of Section 1557 imposes an unconstitutional con-\ndition on Plaintiffs’ receipt of federal funding. See Agency for Int’l Dev., 133 S. Ct. at \n2331. \n315.  HHS’s interpretation of Section 1557 applies to “[a]ny health program \nor activity, any part of which is receiving Federal financial assistance (including cred-\nits, subsidies, or contracts of insurance) provided by [HHS].” 85 Fed.

HHS’s interpretation of Section 1557 requires Plaintiffs to adopt policies \nregarding standards of care for patients that violate Plaintiffs’ religious and consci-\nentious beliefs, as well as their medical judgment, and also interfere with the Plain-\ntiffs’ practice of medicine.  \n317.  Defendants’ actions therefore impose an unconstitutional condition on \nPlaintiffs’ receipt of federal funding and violate Plaintiffs’ rights as secured to them \nby the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution.  \n318.  Absent injunctive and declaratory relief against HHS’s interpretation of \nSection 1557 and Section 1557, Plaintiffs have been and will continue to be harmed.  \nCOUNT X \nViolation of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution \nFree Exercise Clause \n319.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference all preceding paragraphs.  \n320.  Plaintiffs object to providing, facilitating, or otherwise participating in \nmedical transition procedures and abortions.  \n321.  HHS’s interpretation of Section 1557 imposes substantial burdens on \nPlaintiffs by forcing them to choose between federal funding and their livelihood as \nhealthcare providers and their exercise of religion.  \n322.  HHS’s interpretation of Section 1557 seeks to suppress the religious \npractice of individuals and organizations such as Plaintiffs, while allowing exemp-\ntions for similar conduct based on secular and non-religious reasons. Thus, HHS’s \ninterpretation of Section 1557 is neither neutral nor generally applicable.  \n323.  HHS’s interpretation of Section 1557 interferes with a long-recognized, \nhistorically private religious practice contrary to the text, history, and tradition of \nthe First Amendment’s Religion Clauses. \n324.  HHS’s interpretation of Section 1557 is not justified by a compelling gov-\nernmental interest.  \n60 \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 95   Filed 11/23/20   Page 61 of 70\n325.  Even if HHS has a compelling government interest, HHS’s interpreta-\ntion of Section 1557 is not narrowly tailored to achieve that interest.  \n326.  Defendants’ actions thus violate the Plaintiffs’ rights secured to them by \nthe Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment of the United States Constitution.  \n327.  Absent injunctive and declaratory relief against HHS’s interpretation of \nSection 1557 and Section 1557, Plaintiffs have been and will continue to be harmed.  \nCOUNT XI \nViolation of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution \nDue Process Clause \nSubstantive Due Process \n328.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference all preceding paragraphs.  \n329.  The United States has a deeply rooted tradition of honoring physicians’ \nrights to provide medical treatment in accordance with their moral and religious be-\nliefs.  \n330.  Plaintiffs possess a fundamental right of liberty of conscience.  \n331.  Plaintiffs possess a fundamental right not to be coerced to provide med-\nical procedures and services in violation of their conscience.  \n332.  HHS’s interpretation of Section 1557 coerces Plaintiffs to provide medi-\ncal procedures and services in violation of their conscience. \n333.  Defendants’ conduct cannot be justified by a compelling governmental \ninterest.  \n334.  HHS’s interpretation of Section 1557 is not justified by a compelling gov-\nernmental interest.  \n335.  Even if HHS has a compelling government interest, HHS’s interpreta-\ntion of Section 1557 is not narrowly tailored to achieve that interest.  \n336.  Defendants’ actions therefore violate Plaintiffs’ rights to substantive \ndue process.  \n61 \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 95   Filed 11/23/20   Page 62 of 70\n337.  Absent injunctive and declaratory relief against HHS’s interpretation of \nSection 1557 and Section 1557, Plaintiffs have been and will continue to be harmed. \nCOUNT XII \nViolation of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution \nDue Process and Equal Protection \n338.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference all preceding paragraphs.  \n339.  The Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment mandates the equal \ntreatment of all religious faiths and institutions without discrimination or preference.  \n340.  HHS’s interpretation of Section 1557 discriminates on the basis of reli-\ngious views or religious status by refusing to recognize religious exemptions that exist \nin the law.  \n341.  HHS’s interpretation of Section 1557 discriminates on the basis of reli-\ngious views or religious status by refusing to recognize valid medical views of religious \nhealthcare professionals on medical transition procedures.  \n342.  Defendants’ actions thus violate Plaintiffs’ rights secured to them by the \nFifth Amendment of the United States Constitution.  \n343.  Absent injunctive and declaratory relief against HHS’s interpretation of \nSection 1557 and Section 1557, Plaintiffs have been and will continue to be harmed.  \nCOUNT XIII \nViolation of Article I of the United States Constitution \nLack of Clear Notice under the Spending Clause \n344.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference all preceding paragraphs.  \n345.  When Congress exercises its Spending Clause power against the States, \nthe United States Supreme Court has held that principles of federalism require con-\nditions on Congressional funds given to States to enable a state official to “clearly \nunderstand,” from the language of the law itself, what conditions the State is agreeing \nto when accepting the federal funds. Arlington Cent. Sch. Bd. of Educ. v. Murphy, 548 \nU.S. 291, 296 (2006). “The legitimacy of Congress’s exercise of the spending power \n62 \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 95   Filed 11/23/20   Page 63 of 70\n‘thus rests on whether the [entity] voluntarily and knowingly accepts the terms of the \n‘contract.’’” NFIB v. Sebelius, 567 U.S. 519, 577 (2012) (quoting Pennhurst State Sch. \n& Hosp. v. Halderman, 451 U.S. 1, 17 (1981)). Defendants’ ex-post interpretation of \nSection 1557 is not in accord with the understanding that existed when the States \nchose to begin accepting Medicare and Medicaid as payment for medical services pro-\nvided. Bennett v. New Jersey, 470 U.S. 632, 638 (1985) (providing that a state’s obli-\ngation under cooperative federalism program ‘‘generally should be determined by ref-\nerence to the law in effect when the grants were made’’). \n346.  The text employed by Congress does not support understanding the \nterm “sex” in the manner put forth by Defendants. While Congress has expressed its \nintent to cover “gender identity,” as a protected class, in other pieces of legislation, \nsee, e.g., 18 U.S.C. § 249(a)(2)(A); 42 U.S.C. § 13925(b)(13)(A), it has not done so in \nTitle IX. In other legislation, Congress included “gender identity” along with “sex,” \nthus evidencing its intent for “sex” in Title IX to retain its original and only mean-\ning—one’s immutable, biological sex as acknowledged at or before birth. \n347.  The Section 1557 Regulations were passed under the authority Congress \ndelegated to HHS in Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act. Section 1557 does not \nadd a new non-discrimination provision to the federal code, but merely incorporates \nby reference pre-existing provisions under Title VI, Title IX, the Americans with Dis-\nabilities Act, and the Rehabilitation Act. Section 1557 does not independently define \nterms such as “sex.”  \n348.  At the time that the ACA was passed in 2010, no federal courts or agen-\ncies had interpreted “sex” in Title IX to include gender identity.  \n349.  Title IX also provides that “Nothing in this chapter shall be construed \nto require ... any person, or public or private entity, to provide or pay for any benefit \nor service, including the use of facilities, related to an abortion.” 20 U.S.C. § 1688. \n63 \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 95   Filed 11/23/20   Page 64 of 70\n350.  Thus, no State could fathom, much less “clearly understand,” that the \nACA would impose on it the conditions created by HHS’s interpretation of Section \n1557—namely, a new “gender identity” requirement, as well as a provision to require \ncoverage, funding, or facilities for abortion. Accordingly, HHS’s interpretation of Sec-\ntion 1557 violates the Spending Clause. \n351.  Moreover, Defendants are “agencies” under the APA, 5 U.S.C. § 551(1), \nand HHS’s interpretation of Section 1557 complained of herein is a “rule” under the \nAPA, id. § 551(4), and constitutes “[a]gency action made reviewable by statute and \nfinal agency action for which there is no other adequate remedy in a court.” Id. § 704. \nThe APA requires the Court to hold unlawful and set aside any agency action that is \n“contrary to constitutional right, power, privilege, or immunity” or “in excess of stat-\nutory  jurisdiction,  authority,  or  limitations,  or  short  of  statutory  right.” \nId. § 706(2)(B)–(C). Thus, the Spending Clause violations articulated herein provide \nthe Court with an additional basis to set aside the new Rule under the APA. \n352.  The Defendants’ actions thus violate the APA and the Spending Clause \nof the United States Constitution.  \n353.  Absent injunctive and declaratory relief against HHS’s interpretation of \nSection 1557 and Section 1557, the State Plaintiffs have been and will continue to be \nharmed. \nCOUNT XIV \nViolation of the Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution \nUnlawful Abrogation of Sovereign Immunity \n354.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference all preceding paragraphs.  \n355.  The federal government may not abrogate a state’s sovereign immunity \nunless it makes that intention to abrogate unmistakably clear in the language of the \nstatute and acts pursuant to a valid exercise of its power under § 5 of the Fourteenth \n64 \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 95   Filed 11/23/20   Page 65 of 70\nAmendment. See, e.g., Nevada Dep’t of Human Res. v. Hibbs, 538 U.S. 721, 726, 728 \nn.2 (2003). \n356.  The abrogation referenced herein was not unmistakably clear in the lan-\nguage of the relevant statutes, and Defendants did not act pursuant to a valid exer-\ncise of federal power under § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.   \n357.  In enacting Section 1557 of the ACA, Congress did not make findings \nregarding “gender identity,” but merely incorporated existing law under Title IX, \nwhich does not extend to “gender identity.” Congress has in fact declined to pass spe-\ncific “gender identity” legislation on numerous occasions.  \n358.  HHS’s interpretation of Section 1557 abrogates the sovereign immunity \nof the States by subjecting them to lawsuits from their employees. It does so without \nclear authorization from Congress, and its expansion of the definition of “sex” to in-\nclude “gender identity” is not supported by Congressional findings.  \n359.  HHS’s interpretation of Section 1557 abrogates the sovereign immunity \nof the States by subjecting them to lawsuits from non-employees, including spouses \nand dependents of its employees, students at health-related schools run by the States, \nand patients at state-run hospitals and medical facilities. It does so without clear \nauthorization from Congress, and its expansion of the definition of “sex” to include \n“gender identity” is not supported by Congressional findings.  \n360.  Moreover, Defendants are “agencies” under the APA, 5 U.S.C. § 551(1), \nand HHS’s interpretation of Section 1557 complained of herein is a “rule” under the \nAPA, id. § 551(4), and constitutes “[a]gency action made reviewable by statute and \nfinal agency action for which there is no other adequate remedy in a court.” Id. § 704. \nThe APA requires the Court to hold unlawful and set aside any agency action that is \n“contrary to constitutional right, power, privilege, or immunity” or “in excess of stat-\nutory  jurisdiction,  authority,  or  limitations,  or  short  of  statutory  right.” \nId. § 706(2)(B)-(C). Thus, the improper abrogation of the States’ sovereign immunity \n65 \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 95   Filed 11/23/20   Page 66 of 70\narticulated herein provides the Court with an additional basis to set aside the new \nRule under the APA. \n361.  The Defendants’ actions thus violate the APA and the Eleventh Amend-\nment to the United States Constitution.  \n362.  Absent injunctive and declaratory relief against HHS’s interpretation of \nSection 1557 and Section 1557, the State Plaintiffs have been and will continue to be \nharmed. \nCOUNT XV \nViolation of the Spending Clause of Article I of the U.S. Constitution \nThe Regulation is Unlawful and Unconstitutionally Coercive \n363.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference all preceding paragraphs. \n364.  The federal government cannot use its Spending Clause powers to coerce \nthe States, even when proper notice procedures are followed.  \n365.  The Supreme Court struck down a similar attempt under the ACA be-\ncause “such conditions take the form of threats to terminate other significant inde-\npendent grants,” and are therefore “properly viewed as a means of pressuring the \nStates to accept policy changes.” NFIB, 567 U.S. at 580. \n366.  HHS’s  interpretation  of  Section  1557  threatens  other  independent \ngrants, such as general Medicare and Medicaid funds, as well as other health-related \ngrants. \n367.  By placing in jeopardy a substantial percentage of the State’s budget if \nit refuses to comply with HHS’s interpretation of Section 1557, Defendants have left \nthe State no real choice but to acquiesce in such policy. See id. at 582 (“The threatened \nloss of over 10 percent of a State’s overall budget, in contrast, is economic dragooning \nthat leaves the States with no real option but to acquiesce ...”). \n368.  Such compulsion is excessive under the Spending Clause, even in the \npresence of clear notice. “Congress may use its spending power to create incentives \n66 \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 95   Filed 11/23/20   Page 67 of 70\nfor [entities] to act in accordance with federal policies. But when ‘pressure turns into \ncompulsion,’ the legislation runs contrary to our system of federalism.” Id. at 577-\n78 (quoting Charles C. Steward Mach. Co. v. Davis, 301 U.S. 548, 590 (1937)) (inter-\nnal citation omitted). “That is true whether Congress directly commands a State to \nregulate or indirectly coerces a State to adopt a federal regulatory system as its own.” \nId. at 578. \n369.  The compulsion is also improper because HHS’s interpretation of Sec-\ntion 1557 changes the conditions for the receipt of federal funds after the States had \nalready accepted Congress’s original conditions. But “[t]he legitimacy of Congress’s \nexercise of the spending power ‘thus rests on whether the [entity] voluntarily and \nknowingly accepts the terms of the ‘contract.’’” Id. at 577 (quoting Pennhurst, 451 \nU.S. at 17). \n370.  Moreover, Defendants are “agencies” under the APA, 5 U.S.C. § 551(1), \nand HHS’s interpretation of Section 1557 complained of herein is a “rule” under the \nAPA, id. § 551(4), and constitutes “[a]gency action made reviewable by statute and \nfinal agency action for which there is no other adequate remedy in a court.” Id. § 704. \nThe APA requires the Court to hold unlawful and set aside any agency action that is \n“contrary to constitutional right, power, privilege, or immunity” or “in excess of stat-\nutory  jurisdiction,  authority,  or  limitations,  or  short  of  statutory  right.” \nId. § 706(2)(B)-(C). Thus, the Spending Clause violations articulated herein provide \nthe Court with an additional basis to set aside the new Rule under the APA. \n371.  The Defendants’ actions thus violate the APA and the Spending Clause \nof the United States Constitution.  \n372.  Absent injunctive and declaratory relief against HHS’s interpretation of \nSection 1557 and Section 1557, the Plaintiffs have been and will continue to be \nharmed. \n67 \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 95   Filed 11/23/20   Page 68 of 70\nCOUNT XVI \nViolation of Article I and the Tenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution \nThe Regulation Unlawfully Commandeers the States \n373.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference all preceding paragraphs.  \n374.  The Tenth Amendment restrains the power of Congress by reserving \npowers for the states that are not delegated to Congress in Article I.  \n375.  With HHS’s interpretation of Section 1557, Defendants have “comman-\ndeer[ed] a State’s legislative or administrative apparatus for federal purposes.” NFIB, \n567 U.S. at 577. \n376.  Such commandeering exceeds powers delegated to Congress under Arti-\ncle I and invades the powers reserved to the States in the Tenth Amendment. \n377.  Defendants’ actions thus violate Article I and the Tenth Amendment of \nthe United States Constitution.  \n378.  Absent injunctive and declaratory relief against HHS’s interpretation of \nSection 1557 and Section 1557, the Plaintiffs have been and will continue to be \nharmed. \nCOUNT XVII \nViolation of the Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution \nUnconstitutional Exercise of Federal Power \n379.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference all preceding paragraphs. \n380.  State Plaintiff cannot afford the exorbitant and unfunded costs of HHS’s \ninterpretation of Section 1557, but has no choice other than to participate.  \n381.  By effectively co-opting the State’s control over its budgetary processes \nand legislative agendas through compelling it to assume costs it cannot afford, HHS’s \ninterpretation of Section 1557 invades its sovereign sphere. \n382.  HHS’s interpretation of Section 1557 violates the Tenth Amendment of \nthe Constitution of the United States, and runs afoul of the Constitution’s principle \n68 \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 95   Filed 11/23/20   Page 69 of 70\nof federalism, by commandeering the State and its employees as agents of the federal \ngovernment’s regulatory scheme at the State’s own cost.  \n383.  The Defendants’ actions thus violate the Tenth Amendment to the \nUnited States Constitution.  \n384.  Absent injunctive and declaratory relief against HHS’s interpretation \nof Section 1557 and Section 1557, the Plaintiffs have been and will continue to be \nharmed. \nV. PRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWherefore, Plaintiffs pray the Court:  \na.  Declare that interpreting or applying Section 1557 to require provision and \ncoverage of gender-transition procedures and abortions is invalid under:  \ni.  the Administrative Procedure Act; \nii.  the Religious Freedom Restoration Act;  \niii.  the First Amendment to the United States Constitution;  \niv.  the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution; \nv.  the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution;  \nvi.  the Spending Clause of Article I of the United States Constitution; \nvii.  the Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution; \nviii.  the Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution;  \nb.

Action No. ___________ \nMERCY HEALTH CARE   \nCENTER (Jackson, MN); \nSACRED HEART MERCY  COMPLAINT \nHEALTH CARE CENTER (Alma, \nMI); SMP HEALTH SYSTEM;   \nUNIVERSITY OF MARY;   \n   \n- and -   \n   \nSTATE OF NORTH DAKOTA,     \n \n    Plaintiffs, \n \nv. \n \nSYLVIA BURWELL, Secretary   \nof the United States Department of \nHealth  and  Human  Services;  and \nUNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF \nHEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, \n \n    Defendants. \n \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-RRE-ARS   Document 1   Filed 11/07/16   Page 2 of 82\nINTRODUCTION AND NATURE OF THE ACTION \nThis lawsuit challenges a new Regulation (“Regulation” or “Rule”) issued by \nthe Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) that seeks to override the \nmedical  judgment  of  healthcare  professionals  across  the  country.  On  pain  of \nsignificant financial liability, the Regulation forces doctors to perform controversial \nand  sometimes  harmful  medical  procedures  ostensibly  designed  to  permanently \nchange an individual’s sex—including the sex of children. Under the new Regulation, \na doctor must perform these procedures even when they are contrary to the doctor’s \nmedical judgment and could result in significant, long-term medical harm. Thus, the \nRegulation represents a radical invasion of the federal bureaucracy into a doctor’s \nmedical judgment. \nHHS attempts to impose these dramatic new requirements by redefining a \nsingle  word  incorporated  in  the  Affordable  Care  Act:  “sex.”  For  decades,  across \nmultiple federal statutes, Congress has consistently used the term “sex” to refer to an \nindividual’s status as male or female, as determined by a person’s biological sex at \nbirth. But in the Regulation, HHS redefines “sex” to include “an individual’s internal \nsense of gender, which may be male, female, neither, or a combination of male and \nfemale, and which may be different from an individual’s sex assigned at birth.” 45 \nC.F.R. § 92.4. Thus, with a single stroke of the pen, HHS has created a massive new \nliability for thousands of healthcare professionals unless they cast aside their medical \njudgment and perform controversial and even harmful medical transition procedures. \nAnd HHS has done this despite the fact that Congress has repeatedly rejected similar \n2 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-RRE-ARS   Document 1   Filed 11/07/16   Page 3 of 82\nattempts to redefine “sex” through legislation, and federal courts have repeatedly \nrejected attempts to accomplish the same goal through litigation.  \nThe Regulation not only forces healthcare professionals to violate their medical \njudgment, it also forces them to violate their deeply held religious beliefs. Plaintiffs \ninclude the Religious Sisters of Mercy, an order of Catholic religious sisters who \ndevote themselves to works of mercy primarily in the fields of education and health \ncare, and who serve in healthcare centers, including the two Plaintiff Sacred Heart \nMercy Health Care Center clinics owned and operated by the Sisters of Mercy; SMP \nHealth System, a Catholic Health System sponsored by the Sisters of Mary of the \nPresentation that fulfills the healing ministry of Jesus by operating hospitals, clinics, \nand nursing homes in rural North Dakota; and the University of Mary, a Catholic \nuniversity that infuses Benedictine values throughout its educational experience, \nincluding its premier nursing program. These religious organizations are deeply \ncommitted to the dignity of every human person, and their doctors and nurses are \ntrained  to  care  for  everyone  with  joy  and  compassion.  They  eagerly  provide \ncomprehensive  care  to  society’s most vulnerable  populations, but  their  religious \nbeliefs will not allow them to perform or pay for medical transition procedures that \ncan be deeply harmful to patients. Tragically, the Regulation would force them to \nviolate those religious beliefs and perform harmful medical transition procedures or \nelse suffer massive financial liability. The regulation also requires that they pay for \nthese same medical transition procedures in their health plans on pain of massive \nfinancial liability.  \n3 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-RRE-ARS   Document 1   Filed 11/07/16   Page 4 of 82\nThe Regulation also undermines the longstanding sovereign power of States \nsuch  as  North  Dakota  to  regulate  healthcare,  ensure  appropriate  standards  of \nmedical judgment, and protect its citizens’ constitutional and civil rights. Under this \nRule,  States are  now  required  to  force  all  healthcare  professionals  at  state-run \nfacilities to participate in medical transition procedures (including hormone therapy, \nplastic surgery, hysterectomies, and gender reassignment surgery), and to cover \nthose procedures in the States’ health insurance plans, even if a doctor believes such \nprocedures are harmful to the patient. The Rule exposes the States to litigation by its \nemployees  and  patients,  despite  the  fact  that  neither  Congress  nor  the  States \nexpressed any intent to waive the States’ sovereign immunity in this area. And the \nRule threatens to strip the States of billions of dollars in federal healthcare funding, \njeopardizing the availability of healthcare for the nation’s most vulnerable citizens.  \nUltimately,  this  case  boils  down  to  a  very  simple  question  of  statutory \ninterpretation: Can HHS redefine the term “sex” to thwart decades of settled judicial \nand Congressional precedent and impose massive new obligations on healthcare \nprofessionals and sovereign States? The answer is “no,” and the new Regulation must \nbe set aside as a violation of the Administrative Procedure Act and multiple other \nfederal laws and constitutional provisions.  \nI. PARTIES \n1.  Plaintiff Religious Sisters of Mercy (“Sisters of Mercy”) is a Catholic \norder of religious sisters devoted to works of mercy, including offering healthcare to \nthe underserved. Located in Alma, Michigan, the Sisters of Mercy is a nonprofit \n4 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-RRE-ARS   Document 1   Filed 11/07/16   Page 5 of 82\ncorporation incorporated in 1973. The Sisters of Mercy are an international institute \nof pontifical right—that is, officially approved by the Vatican—which traces its roots \nback to Venerable Catherine McAuley in Dublin, Ireland in 1831. \n2.  Each Sister of Mercy has chosen to follow Jesus Christ by taking a \nlifetime vow to serve the poor and sick by offering care for the whole person, and \nworking to heal those who are suffering from physical, psychological, intellectual, and \nspiritual woundedness. The Sisters of Mercy offer a variety of apostolic services. One \naspect of their mission is fulfilled through “comprehensive health care” services, \nwhich the Sisters of Mercy understand as “the complete care of the total human \nperson” which “seeks to bring about that profound and extensive healing which is a \ncontinuation of the work of redemption.”  Consistent with this mission, some of the \nSisters of Mercy serve in healthcare facilities, such as hospitals, throughout the \ncountry.  These  Sisters  include  licensed  doctors,  including  a  surgeon,  and  other \nhealthcare professionals. In accordance with their vows, the Sisters of Mercy offer \nhealthcare services in accordance with the Ethical and Religious Directives of the \nUnited States Conference of Catholic Bishops.  \n3.  The Sisters of Mercy own and operate two clinics, Plaintiff Sacred Heart \nMercy Health Care Center in Alma, Michigan, and Plaintiff Sacred Heart Mercy \nHealth Care Center in Jackson, Minnesota. Both are nonprofits incorporated in their \nrespective states. The Sisters of Mercy also run their clinics in accordance with the \nEthical and Religious Directives of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops. \n5 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-RRE-ARS   Document 1   Filed 11/07/16   Page 6 of 82\nSome of the Sisters of Mercy serve as licensed doctors, nurses, or other healthcare \nprofessionals who perform medical services in these clinics.  \n4.  Plaintiff  Sisters  of Mary  of  the  Presentation  Health  System  (“SMP \nHealth System”) is a non-profit Catholic health system headquartered in Fargo, \nNorth  Dakota.  It  was  founded  and  is  operated  by  the  Sisters  of  Mary  of  the \nPresentation. The Sisters believe that Catholic health care services and programs are \necclesial in nature, mandated by the Church to carry on the healing ministry of Jesus. \n5.  As part of that healing ministry, SMP Health System provides a variety \nof health care services throughout North Dakota, including hospitals, clinics, long-\nterm care facilities, and senior housing.   \n6.  SMP Health System’s mission statement is as follows: “SMP Health \nSystem, inspired by the Sisters of Mary of the Presentation, provides leadership to \nits Catholic health care ministries as they work to fulfill the healing mission of Jesus.” \nIn accordance with that mission, the Sisters of Mary run the health care ministries \nin  accordance  with  the  Ethical  and  Religious  Directives  of  the  United  States \nConference of Catholic Bishops. \n7.  Plaintiff University of Mary is a Roman Catholic Benedictine University \nwith its primary campus in Bismarck, North Dakota. The University of Mary also \nhas campuses throughout North Dakota and in several other states, Arequipa, Peru, \nand Rome, Italy. The University offers more than 60 degree programs, including \nnursing, theology, pastoral ministry, and Catholic studies.  \n6 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-RRE-ARS   Document 1   Filed 11/07/16   Page 7 of 82\n8.  The University strives to infuse all of its programs with Christian, \nCatholic, Benedictine values to prepare its students to be ethical leaders in their \ncareers and their communities. The University welcomes students of all faiths and \nbackgrounds, and, as is fundamental to its mission, upholds Catholic teaching in all \nof its programs and services. The University provides health benefits to its employees \nthrough a self-funded health plan. The University offers a nursing program and many \nallied health programs, including physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech and \nlanguage  pathology,  radiologic  technology,  respiratory  therapy,  exercise  science, \nathletic training, and social work.  \n9.  The State of North Dakota oversees and controls several agencies and a \nhealthcare facility that receive federal funding administered by HHS. For example, \nNorth Dakota State Hospital, located in Jamestown, is a state-run hospital that \naccepts  HHS-administered  funding  and  provides  psychiatric  and  chemical \ndependency  treatment  to  North  Dakotans  who  require  in-patient  or  specialized \nresidential care. Its clinical disciplines include psychiatry, psychology, nursing, social \nwork, addiction counseling, chaplaincy, education, occupational therapy, therapeutic \nrecreation,  and  vocational  rehabilitation.  North  Dakota  also  employs  many \nhealthcare employees through its constituent agencies, and provides health benefits \nto those employees and their families. \n10.

The Court has subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 \nand 1361.  \n14.  Venue lies in this district pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391.  \nIII. FACTUAL BACKGROUND \nA.  The Affordable Care Act and Related Federal Statutes. \n15.  In March 2010, Congress passed, and President Obama signed into law, \nthe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Pub. L. 111-148 (March 23, 2010), \nand the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, Pub. L. 111-152 (March 30, \n2010), collectively known as the “Affordable Care Act” or “ACA.” \n16.  Section 1557 of the ACA states that no individual can be denied certain \nfederally-funded  health  benefits  because  of  the  individual’s  race,  color,  national \norigin, sex, age, or disability. 42 U.S.C. § 18116. Section 1557 does not add a new non-\ndiscrimination  provision  to  the  United  States  Code,  but  merely  incorporates  by \nreference  pre-existing  provisions  under  Title  VI,  Title  IX,  the  Americans  with \nDisabilities Act, and the Rehabilitation Act. Section 1557 does not independently \ndefine terms such as “sex.” Section 1557’s sole basis for prohibiting sex discrimination \nis based on its reference to Title IX, 20 U.S.C. § 1681 et seq. \n8 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-RRE-ARS   Document 1   Filed 11/07/16   Page 9 of 82\n17.  Title IX does not apply to covered entities “controlled by a religious \norganization if the application of this subsection would not be consistent with the \nreligious tenets of such organization.” 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a)(3). \n18.  Title IX also states that it cannot be “construed to require or prohibit \nany person, or public or private entity, to provide or pay for any benefit or service, \nincluding the use of facilities, related to an abortion.” 20 U.S.C. § 1688. \n19.  At the time that the ACA was enacted in 2010, no federal courts and no \nfederal agencies had interpreted “sex” in Title IX to include gender identity.  \n20.  At the time that the ACA was enacted, and to this day, Congress has \nrepeatedly rejected attempts to expand the term “sex” in Title IX. Lawmakers have \nalso  rejected  multiple  attempts  to  amend  the  Civil  Rights  Act  to  add  the  new \ncategories of “sexual orientation” and “gender identity.” The first such attempt was \nin  1974,  and  there  have  been  dozens  of  such  attempts  since  then.  They  have \nrepeatedly failed.  \n21.  The ACA states that “nothing in this title (or any amendment made by \nthis title), shall be construed to require a qualified health plan to provide [abortion] \ncoverage . . . as part of its essential health benefits for any plan year.” 42 U.S.C. \n§ 18023(b)(1)(A)(i). 42 U.S.C. § 18023(b)(1)(A)(i).  \n22.  Federally-funded programs may not require an “individual to perform \nor  assist  in  the  performance  of  any  sterilization  procedure  or  abortion  if  his \nperformance or assistance in the performance of such procedure or abortion would be \ncontrary  to  his  religious  beliefs  or  moral  convictions.”  42  U.S.C. § 300a-7(b)(1). \n9 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-RRE-ARS   Document 1   Filed 11/07/16   Page 10 of 82\nCongress has also mandated that “[n]o individual shall be required to perform or \nassist in the performance of any part of a health service program or research activity \nfunded in whole or in part under a program administered by the Secretary of Health \nand Human Services if his performance or assistance in the performance of such part \nof  such  program  or  activity  would  be  contrary  to  his  religious  beliefs  or  moral \nconvictions.” Id. § 300a-7(d). \nB.  The Regulation. \n23.  On September 8, 2015, HHS proposed a new rule to “interpret” Section \n1557 of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), to extend Title IX’s definition of “sex” to \ninclude “gender identity,” “sex stereotypes,” and “termination of pregnancy,” among \nother things. 45 C.F.R. § 92.4.  \n24.  The Rule was published as final on May 18, 2016, and it expanded the \ndefinition of “gender identity” even further from the proposed definition to mean an \nindividual’s “internal sense of gender, which may be male, female, neither, or a \ncombination of male and female.” Id. HHS stated in the Rule that “gender identity \nspectrum includes an array of possible gender identities beyond male and female,” \nand individuals with “non-binary gender identities are protected under the rule.” \nNondiscrimination in Health Programs and Activities, 81 Fed. Reg. 31376, 31392, \n31384 (May 18, 2016). HHS cited as authority the “Dear Colleague” letter issued \n10 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-RRE-ARS   Document 1   Filed 11/07/16   Page 11 of 82\njointly by the Department of Education (ED) and Department of Justice (DOJ) just \nfive days earlier.1  \n25.  The  Rule  also  defines  “sex”  to  include  discrimination  based  upon \n“termination of pregnancy” in covered programs. HHS declined to add an explicit \ncarve-out for abortion and abortion-related services parallel to the carve-out included \nin Title IX; it merely noted the existence of conscience protections in federal law and \nACA limitations on requirement for abortion coverage in certain contexts. Id. at \n31388.  \n26.  This new Regulation applies to any entities or individuals that operate, \noffer, or contract for health programs and activities that receive any Federal financial \nassistance from HHS.2 In light of this sweeping application, HHS has estimated the \nRule will “likely cover[] almost all licensed physicians because they accept Federal \nfinancial  assistance,”  including  payments  from  Medicare  and  Medicaid.3  Other \nobservers have estimated that the Rule will apply “to over 133,000 (virtually all) \nhospitals, nursing homes, home health agencies, and similar provider facilities, about \n445,000 clinical laboratories, 1,200 community health centers, 171 health-related \n                                                 \n1 U.S. Dep’t of Justice & U.S. Dep’t of Educ., Dear Colleague Letter on \nTransgender Students, May 13, 2016, \nhttp://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/letters/colleague-201605-title-ix-\ntransgender.pdf. \n2 45 C.F.R. § 92.4. \n3 Nondiscrimination in Health Programs and Activities, 80 Fed. Reg. 54172, 54195 \n(proposed Sept. 8, 2015); 81 Fed.

The new Rule requires covered entities to provide health programs or \nactivities in accordance with HHS’s expansive and unwarranted definition of “sex.” \nThis includes a number of new requirements. \n1.   Healthcare  professionals  must  perform  or  refer  for \nmedical transition procedures.  \n28.  The Rule requires covered employers, and their healthcare providers \nand professionals, to perform (or refer for) medical transition procedures (such as \nhysterectomies,  mastectomies,  hormone  treatments,  plastic  surgery,  etc.),  if  a \nphysician or healthcare provider offers analogous services in other contexts. For \nexample, in the preamble, HHS stated, “A provider specializing in gynecological \nservices that previously declined to provide a medically necessary hysterectomy for a \ntransgender  man  would  have  to  revise  its  policy  to  provide  the  procedure  for \ntransgender individuals in the same manner it provides the procedure for other \nindividuals.”5 HHS explained that a hysterectomy in this medical transition context \n                                                 \n4 Timothy Jost, Implementing Health Reform: HHS Proposes Rule Implementing \nAnti-Discrimination  ACA  Provisions  (Contraceptive  Coverage  Litigation  Update), \nHealth  Affairs  Blog  (Sept.  4,  2015),  http://healthaffairs.org/blog/2015/09/04/ \nimplementing-health-reform-hhs-proposes-rule-implementing-anti-discrimination-\naca-provisions/. \n5 81 Fed. Reg. at 31455. \n12 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-RRE-ARS   Document 1   Filed 11/07/16   Page 13 of 82\nwould be “medically necessary to treat gender dysphoria,”6 thereby declaring medical \nnecessity, benefit, and prudence as a matter of federal law, and without regard to the \nopinions,  judgment,  and  conscientious  considerations  of  the  many  medical \nprofessionals that hold views to the contrary. \n29.  There is widespread, well-documented debate about the medical risks \nand ethics associated with various medical transition procedures, even within the \ntransgender community itself. In fact, HHS’s own medical experts recently wrote, \n“Based on a thorough review of the clinical evidence available at this time, there is \nnot enough evidence to determine whether gender reassignment surgery improves \nhealth outcomes for Medicare beneficiaries with gender dysphoria.”7 The evidence \nshowed  that  “[t]here  were  conflicting  (inconsistent)  study  results—of  the  best \ndesigned studies, some reported benefits while others reported harms.”8 Yet the new \nRule  attempts  to  preempt  the  serious  medical  and  moral  debate  about  gender \ntransition procedures by concluding in the context of physicians offering “health \nservices”  that  a  “categorization  of  all  transition-related  treatment  .  .  .  as \nexperimental,  is  outdated  and  not  based  on  current  standards  of  care.”9  The \nRegulation also improperly preempts the prerogative of States not only to regulate \n                                                 \n6 Id. at 31429. \n7 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, Proposed Decision Memo for Gender \nDysphoria and Gender Reassignment Surgery (June 2, 2016). \n8 Id. (emphasis added). \n9 81 Fed. Reg. at 31435; see also id. at 31429. \n13 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-RRE-ARS   Document 1   Filed 11/07/16   Page 14 of 82\nthe healing professions, but also to maintain standards of care that rely upon the \nmedical judgment of health professionals as to what is in the best interests of their \npatients. \n30.  Furthermore, a number of commenters requested that HHS make clear \nthat  health  services  need  only  be  covered  if  they  are  deemed  to  be  “medically \nnecessary” or “medically appropriate” in the professional opinion of those charged \nwith the care of the patient at issue. But HHS refused to make this clarification, \nstating that some procedures “related to gender transition” may be required even if \nthey were not “strictly identified as medically necessary or appropriate.”10 Thus, \nunder the Regulation, if a doctor would perform a mastectomy as part of a medically-\nnecessary treatment for breast cancer, it would be illegal for the same doctor to \ndecline to perform a mastectomy for a medical transition, even if the doctor believed \nthat removing healthy breast tissue was contrary to the patient’s medical interest.  \n31.  Because Plaintiff SMP Health System provides hysterectomies to some \npatients,  such  as  those  diagnosed  with  uterine  cancer,  the  Regulations  would \nsimultaneously force it to provide a hysterectomy (and remove an otherwise healthy \nuterus) for a medical transition, notwithstanding the serious potential harm to the \npatient. Elective hysterectomies increase a number of health risks for the patient. \nMoreover,  such  a  procedure  also  renders  an  individual  permanently  sterile. \nNevertheless, the Regulations would require Plaintiffs to perform that procedure \n                                                 \n10 Id. at 31435.  \n14 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-RRE-ARS   Document 1   Filed 11/07/16   Page 15 of 82\neven when they believed it was not in the best interests of the patient. Such a \nstandard turns the venerable medical oath to “do no harm” on its head. \n32.  And while Plaintiffs such as the two Sacred Heart Mercy Health Care \nCenter clinics provide hormone treatments to patients for medical reasons in some \ncontexts, these health professionals have serious medical and religious concerns with \noffering hormone treatment for a medical transition.  \n2.   Healthcare  facilities  and  professionals  must  alter their \nspeech and medical advice. \n33.  As discussed above, HHS has concluded, in the context of physicians \noffering “health services,” that a “categorization of all transition-related treatment \n. . . as experimental, is outdated and not based on current standards of care.”11 In so \ndoing, HHS has seriously curbed a physician’s ability to offer a contrary view, even if \nsuch  a  view  is based  on  the  physician’s  professional  training  and  best  medical \njudgment. This Regulation would thus force healthcare providers to alter speech and \nmedical advice to comply with the Rule. \n34.  Under  the  Rule,  HHS  would  compel  the  speech  of  healthcare \nprofessionals  in  several  ways.  For  example,  the  Rule  mandates  revisions  to \nhealthcare  professionals’  written  policies,  requiring  express  affirmance  that \ntransition-related procedures will be provided,12 even if such revisions do not reflect \nthe medical judgment, values, or beliefs of the individuals or organizations. Second, \n                                                 \n11 Id. \n12 Id. at 31455. \n15 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-RRE-ARS   Document 1   Filed 11/07/16   Page 16 of 82\nit requires physicians to use gender-transition affirming language in all situations \nregardless of circumstance, and provides as just one example the requirement that \nmedical providers use “a transgender individual’s preferred name and pronoun.”13 \nHHS also relies upon a transgender medical guidance document stating that “Mental \nhealth professionals should not impose a binary view of gender.”14 Thus, to avoid \nfacing  liability  for  being  discriminatory  under  the  proposed  rule,  healthcare \nprofessionals are compelled to speak by revising their policy to endorse transition-\nrelated services, to express language that is affirming of gender transition, and to \nexpress and explore a view of gender that is not binary. Further, by treating as \ndiscriminatory a medical view of “transition-related treatment . . . as experimental,”15 \nHHS is coercing medical professionals like Plaintiffs to speak about these procedures \nthe way the government wants them to, even though they disagree, and even though \nthey believe they are disserving their patients by concealing the information the \ngovernment wants concealed. \n3.  Certain  employers  and  insurance  providers  must  offer \nemployee benefits covering medical transition procedures. \n35.  The  Regulation  prohibits  certain  employers,  health  programs,  or \ninsurance plans from exercising judgment as to what they cover. HHS stated, “[A]n \n                                                 \n13 Id. at 31406. \n14  Id.  at  31435  n.263 (citing  World  Professional  Association for  Transgender \nHealth (WPATH), Standards of Care for the Health of Transsexual, Transgender, and \nGender-Nonconforming People at 16 (7th ed. 2012)). \n15 81 Fed. Reg. at 31435. \n16 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-RRE-ARS   Document 1   Filed 11/07/16   Page 17 of 82\nexplicit, categorical (or automatic) exclusion or limitation of coverage for all health \nservices related to gender transition is unlawful on its face.”16  \n36.  For example, if a doctor concludes that a hysterectomy “is medically \nnecessary to treat gender dysphoria,” the patient’s employer or insurance plan would \nbe required to cover the procedure on the same basis that it would cover it for other \nconditions  (like  cancer).17  HHS  also  stated  that  the  “range  of transition-related \nservices, which includes treatment for gender dysphoria, is not limited to surgical \ntreatments and may include, but is not limited to, services such as hormone therapy \nand psychotherapy, which may occur over the lifetime of the individual.”18 As such, \ncoverage is required under the new Rule notwithstanding the rights of employers that \nonly offer employee health benefits consistent with the religious beliefs and values of \ntheir organization. \n37.  This  conflict  with  religious  or  otherwise  conscientious  employers \nextends beyond treatment surrounding gender dysphoria, because some required \nprocedures (such as elective hysterectomies) result in sterilization, and the new Rule \nalso extends to “termination of pregnancy.” 45 C.F.R. § 92.4. Although HHS states \nthat laws protecting religious objections to abortion (or “termination of pregnancy”) \nwill apply, HHS recently approved California forcing all insurers to include abortion \ncoverage, even for objecting religious institutions. And HHS could have included, but \n                                                 \n16 Id. at 31429.  \n17 Id.  \n18 Id. at 31435-36. \n17 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-RRE-ARS   Document 1   Filed 11/07/16   Page 18 of 82\nexplicitly chose to exclude, a clear regulatory carve-out for services related to abortion \nthat parallels the carve-out in Title IX.  \n38.  This health benefit requirement of the new Rule applies to any of the \nfollowing types of employers who receive HHS funding: 1) any entity principally \ninvolved in providing or administering health services (including hospitals, nursing \nhomes, counseling centers, physicians’ offices, etc.), 2) any type of employer who \nreceives HHS funding for the primary purpose of funding an “employee health benefit \nprogram,” or 3) any entity such as a university with a health training or research \nprogram  that  receives  HHS  funding  or  Federal  financial  assistance—including \nstudent Pell grants—for that “health program or activity.”19 \n39.  Thus, employers who have always offered employee health benefits that \nreflect  their  religious  or  conscientious  beliefs,  and  excluded  medical  transition \nprocedures from employee benefits, will now be considered discriminatory under the \nRegulation.  \n4.  Sex-specific healthcare facilities or programs, including \nshower  facilities or  hospital wards, must  be  opened to \nindividuals based on gender identity. \n40.  With regard to facilities, the new Rule states that even for sex-specific \nfacilities such as “shower facilities” offered by healthcare providers, individuals may \nnot be excluded “based on their gender identity.”20  \n                                                 \n19 Id. at 31472, 45 C.F.R. § 92.208; see also 81 Fed.

When  Title  IX—the  foundation  for  the  new  Rule—was  enacted, \nCongress was significantly concerned about protecting and preserving the privacy \nrights of individuals in intimate areas. See 20 U.S.C. § 1686, 117 Cong. Rec. 30407 \n(1971), 117 Cong. Rec. 39260 (1971), 117 Cong. Rec. 39263 (1971), and 118 Cong. Rec. \n5807  (1972).  And  the  predecessor  agency  of  HHS,  the  Department  of  Health, \nEducation, and Welfare (HEW), promulgated regulations guaranteeing the privacy of \nindividuals  in  intimate  areas.  See  34  C.F.R. § 106.32(b);  34  C.F.R. § 106.33  (“A \nrecipient may provide separate toilet, locker room, and shower facilities on the basis \nof sex . . .”). Yet, HHS wholly disregarded any “legal right to privacy” that could be \nviolated “simply by permitting another person access to a sex-specific program or \nfacility which corresponds to their gender identity.”21 \n42.  With regard to other health programs, HHS stated that sex-specific \nhealth  programs  or  activities  are  allowable  only  where  the  covered  entity  can \ndemonstrate  an  exceedingly  persuasive  justification,  i.e.,  that  the  sex-specific \nprogram is substantially related to the achievement of an important health-related \nor scientific objective. HHS stated that it “will expect a covered entity to supply \nobjective evidence, and empirical data if available, to justify the need to restrict \nparticipation in the program to only one sex,” and in “no case will [HHS] accept a \njustification that relies on overly broad generalizations about the sexes.”22 \n                                                 \n21 Id. at 31389, 31409. \n22 Id. at 31409. \n19 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-RRE-ARS   Document 1   Filed 11/07/16   Page 20 of 82\n5.  Covered entities must provide assurances of compliance \nand post notices of compliance. \n43.  Through HHS-690 Form, which now references Section 1557, a covered \nentity seeking federal financial assistance must now certify, in relevant part, that “no \nperson in the United States shall, on the ground of race, color, national origin, sex, \nage, or disability be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be \nsubjected to discrimination under any health program or activity for which the \nApplicant receives Federal financial assistance from the Department.”23  \n44.  The Rule requires covered entities to post notices regarding compliance \nwith the Rule in conspicuous locations by October 16, 2016 (90 days from the effective \ndate). HHS provided a sample notice in Appendix A to the new Rule, which states in \nrelevant  part  that  the  covered  entity  “does  not  exclude  people  or  treat  them \ndifferently because of race, color, national origin, age, disability, or sex.”24  \n6.  Enforcement Mechanisms and Remedial Measures. \n45.  Covered entities are required to record and submit compliance reports \nto HHS’s Office of Civil Rights (“OCR”) upon request.25   \n                                                 \n23  HHS,  Assurance  of  Compliance,  https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/hhs-\n690.pdf. \n24  81  Fed.  Reg.  at  31472,  45  C.F.R.  §  92,  App.  A, \nhttps://www.federalregister.gov/articles/  2016/05/18/2016-11458/nondiscrimination-\nin-health-programs-and-activities#h-139.  \n25 81 Fed.

Covered entities that are found to violate the Regulation may lose their \nfederal funding, be barred from doing business with the government, or risk false \nclaims liability.26  \n47.  Covered  entities  are  subject  to  enforcement  proceedings  by  the \nDepartment of Justice.27 \n48.  Covered entities are also subject to individual lawsuits from patients \nwho believe the covered entity has violated the new Rule.28 \n7.  No Religious Exemption. \n49.  Section 1557  does  not  independently  prohibit  discrimination on the \nbasis of sex. Instead, Congress specifically invoked Title IX, 20 U.S.C. § 1681 et seq., \nwhich  includes  both  a  ban  on  sex  discrimination  and  a  generous  carve-out  for \nreligious organizations. In this Regulation interpreting Section 1557, however, HHS \nhas “interpreted” Congress’s reference to Title IX to include the ban, but not the \nreligious exemption.  \n50.  Although  HHS  was  asked  to  include  a  religious  exemption  in  the \nRegulation due to the obvious implications for religious healthcare providers, HHS \ndeclined to do so, stating instead that religious objectors could assert claims under \n                                                 \n26 81 Fed. Reg. at 31472, 45 C.F.R. § 92.301 (“The enforcement mechanisms \navailable for and provided under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 . . . shall \napply for purposes of Section 1557.”) \n27 81 Fed. Reg. at 31440. \n28 Id. at 31472, 45 C.F.R. § 92.301. \n21 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-RRE-ARS   Document 1   Filed 11/07/16   Page 22 of 82\nexisting statutory protections for religious freedom.29 HHS also failed to provide any \nmechanism by which a religious entity could determine if it was entitled to any \nexisting religious protections under the law.  HHS’s refusal to protect the conscience \nrights (or even medical judgment) of physicians is striking when compared to federal \npolicy in other areas. For example, a recent TRICARE guidance memo states in the \ncontext of medical gender dysphoria treatment, “In no circumstance will a provider \nbe required to deliver care that he or she feels unprepared to provide either by lack \nof clinical skill or due to ethical, moral, or religious beliefs.”30 \nC.   The Effect on the Sisters of Mercy \n51.  The Sisters of Mercy founded their order in 1973 for the purpose of \ncarrying out their faith in Jesus Christ by serving others. The Sisters of Mercy have \na variety of apostolate services that they offer. One aspect of their mission is fulfilled \nthrough “comprehensive health care” services, which the Sisters of Mercy understand \nas “the complete care of the total human person” which “seeks to bring about that \nprofound and extensive healing which is a continuation of the work of redemption.”  \nConsistent with this mission, some of the Sisters of Mercy serve in a variety of \ndifferent  healthcare  facilities,  such  as  hospitals,  throughout  the  country.  These \nSisters include licensed doctors, including at least one surgeon, and other healthcare \nprofessionals. In accordance with their vows, the Sisters of Mercy offer healthcare \n                                                 \n29 81 Fed. Reg. at 31376. \n30  Memorandum  from  Karen  S.  Guice,  Acting  Assistant  Sec’y  of  Defense  to \nAssistant Sec’y of the Army, et al., Subject: Guidance for Treatment of Gender \nDysphoria for Active and Reserve Component Service Members (July 29, 2016). \n22 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-RRE-ARS   Document 1   Filed 11/07/16   Page 23 of 82\nservices in accordance with the Ethical and Religious Directives of the United States \nConference of Catholic Bishops.  \n52.  The  Sisters  of  Mercy  hold  religious  beliefs  about  the  nature  and \npurposes of human sexuality, including that sexual identity is an objective fact rooted \nin nature as male or female persons. Like the Catholic Church they serve, the Sisters \nof Mercy believe that every man and woman is created in the image and likeness of \nGod, and that they reflect God’s image in unique—and uniquely dignified—ways.  \n53.  Further, in their professional medical judgment, the Sisters of Mercy \nwho work in health care believe that optimal patient care—including in patient \neducation,  diagnosis,  and  treatment—requires  taking  account  of  the  biological \ndifferences between men and women.  \n54.  In the Sisters’ best medical judgment, providing or assisting with gender \ntransition services is not in keeping with the best interests of their patients, and in \nfact is experimental and could be harmful for patients.  \n55.  Providing services that are contrary to their understanding of God’s plan \nfor human sexuality would also substantially burden the religious exercise of the \nSisters of Mercy.  \n56.  For decades, the religious beliefs of the Sisters of Mercy have been \nrespected by health institutions where they work. But the new Rule now makes it \nillegal for employers to accommodate the religious beliefs of their employees.  \n57.  Thus, this new Rule will impact the Sisters of Mercy by requiring the \nSisters of Mercy to offer medical services that violate their best medical judgment \n23 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-RRE-ARS   Document 1   Filed 11/07/16   Page 24 of 82\nand religious beliefs when they serve in healthcare organizations that are covered \nentities under  the  Rule.  For  example,  Sisters of Mercy  who  offer  endocrinology \nservices or mental health counseling for other medical reasons will now be required \nto provide these medical services as part of a gender transition, which would violate \nboth their best medical judgment and their religious beliefs. \n58.  The Rule also chills the Sisters’ ability to discuss their medical opinions \nwith their patients and offer medical advice freely. And the rule would pressure the \nSisters of Mercy to reject a binary view of gender, which is contrary to their medical \njudgment and religious beliefs.  \n59.  The Rule therefore threatens the ability of the Sisters of Mercy to carry \nout their religious mission of providing comprehensive health care services in the \nhealthcare facilities in which they work. \nD.   The Effect on Sacred Heart Mercy Health Care Centers  \n60.  The Sisters of Mercy also own and operate two health clinics in the \nUnited States: Plaintiff Sacred Heart Mercy Health Care Center in Alma, Michigan; \nand Plaintiff Sacred Heart Mercy Health Care Center in Jackson, Minnesota. Some \nof  the  Sisters  of  Mercy  serve  as  licensed  doctors,  nurses,  or  other  healthcare \nprofessionals in these clinics. Both clinics provide resources to accommodate the \nspiritual needs of employees, patients, and their families. For example, the clinic in \nAlma, Michigan, offers Mass in its chapel, followed by the exposition of the Blessed \nSacrament so that employees, patients, and local residents can worship. Both clinics \nare run by Sisters of Mercy themselves.  \n24 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-RRE-ARS   Document 1   Filed 11/07/16   Page 25 of 82\n61.  The mission of the Sacred Heart Mercy Health Care Center in Michigan \nis to “embrace the extensive expressions of human woundedness in order to extend \nthe healing of the redemption of Jesus Christ.” Sacred Heart Mercy Health Care \nCenter,  Mission,  http://www.sacredheartmercy.org/mission/  (last  visited  Nov.  7, \n2016). The vision of the Center is to “provide outstanding Catholic health care by \nembracing the misery of mankind as a point of convergence with the Mercy of God \nthrough undertaking the works of mercy in a comprehensive manner.” See id. \n62.  In accordance with this vision and mission, the Sacred Heart clinics are \noperated  in  accordance  with  The  Ethical  and  Religious  Directives  for  Catholic \nHealthcare Services, as promulgated by the United States Conference of Catholic \nBishops and interpreted by the local Bishop.  \n63.  The  Sacred  Heart  clinics  strive  to  provide  top-quality  care  to  their \npatients. They serve and respect individuals of all faiths, and seek to ensure that \npatients and their families can exercise their own faith traditions in order to assist \nthem in the healing and recovery process, and to make critical decisions about \nmatters such as end-of-life care and clinical ethics. This new Rule will impact the \nSacred Heart clinics by 1) requiring the Sacred Heart clinics to offer medical services \nthat violate their best medical judgment and religious beliefs, and 2) requiring the \nSacred Heart clinics to provide insurance coverage for services that violate their \nreligious beliefs.  \n25 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-RRE-ARS   Document 1   Filed 11/07/16   Page 26 of 82\n1.  Compulsory Medical Services \n64.  The Sacred Heart clinics provide all of their standard medical services \nto every individual who needs and qualifies for their care, including to individuals \nwho identify as transgender. Thus, for instance, if a transgender individual comes in \nwith high blood pressure or a diabetes diagnosis, the Sacred Heart clinics would \nprovide the same full spectrum of compassionate care for that individual as they \nprovide for every other patient. And, just as they do for every other patient, the Sacred \nHeart clinics would appropriately tailor that care to the biologically sex-specific \nhealth needs of the patient.  \n65.  The Sacred Heart clinics and the Sisters who own and operate them hold \nreligious beliefs about the nature and purposes of human sexuality, including that \nsexual identity is an objective fact rooted in nature as male or female persons. Like \nthe Catholic Church they serve, they believe that every man and woman is created in \nthe image and likeness of God and that they reflect God’s image in unique—and \nuniquely dignified—ways.  \n66.  Further,  in  their  professional  medical  judgment,  the  Sacred  Heart \nclinicians believe that optimal patient care—including patient education, diagnosis, \nand treatment—requires taking account of the biological differences between men \nand women.  \n67.  In the best medical judgment of the Sacred Heart clinics and the Sisters \nwho own and operate them, providing or assisting with gender transition services is \n26 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-RRE-ARS   Document 1   Filed 11/07/16   Page 27 of 82\nnot in keeping with the best interests of their patients, and in fact is experimental \nand could be harmful for patients.  \n68.  Providing services that are contrary to their understanding of God’s plan \nfor human sexuality would also substantially burden the religious exercise of the \nSacred Heart clinics and the Sisters who own and operate them.  \n69.  Accordingly, after careful review of the issue, the Sacred Heart clinics \nand the Sisters who own and operate them made the decision not to provide, perform, \nor otherwise facilitate medical transitions. To provide or otherwise facilitate those \nservices would also violate the religious beliefs of the Sacred Heart clinics and the \nSisters who own and operate them.  \n70.  The  Sacred  Heart  clinics  offer  endocrinology  hormone  services  and \nmental health counseling for anxiety and depression, including for pediatric patients. \nThe new Rule would force the Sacred Heart clinics to offer their services as a part of \na medical transition, which would violate both their best medical judgment and their \nreligious beliefs.  \n71.  The Rule also chills the ability of the clinics and the Sisters at the clinics \nto discuss their medical opinions with their patients and offer medical advice freely. \nAnd the rule would pressure the Sacred Heart clinics and the Sisters who own and \noperate them to reject a binary view of gender, which is contrary to their medical \njudgment and religious beliefs.  \n27 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-RRE-ARS   Document 1   Filed 11/07/16   Page 28 of 82\n2.  Compulsory Insurance Coverage \n72.  The Sacred Heart clinics offer health benefits to eligible employees who \nwork for the clinics.  \n73.  It would violate the religious beliefs of the Sacred Heart clinics and the \nSisters who own and operate them if they were forced to offer a health plan that \nincluded benefits for abortions, sterilizations, or any drugs or procedures related to \ngender transition. Yet after January 1, 2017, the Rule will require them to offer an \ninsurance plan that includes these health benefits.  \n74.  The Sacred Heart clinics and the Sisters who own and operate them \nsincerely  believe  that  providing  insurance  coverage  for  gender  transition, \nsterilization, and abortion would constitute impermissible material cooperation with \nevil. The Sacred Heart clinics must now choose between (a) following their faith and \ntheir best medical judgment, or (b) following the Regulation. If they follow their faith \nand medical judgment, the Sacred Heart clinics will be subject to financial penalties \nand lawsuits. Most significantly, a significant portion of the patients served by the \nSacred Heart clinics are poor, disabled, and elderly Medicare and Medicaid patients. \nIf the Sacred Heart clinics refuse to both deny their faith and lower their standard of \ncare, they risk losing that funding and suffering a crippling blow to their capacity to \ncarry out their religious mission to serve the poor, disabled, and elderly.  \nE.   The Effect on SMP Health System  \n75.  The Sisters of Mary of the Presentation were founded in France in 1828 \nfor the purpose of teaching children and serving the sick, disabled, and elderly. In \n28 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-RRE-ARS   Document 1   Filed 11/07/16   Page 29 of 82\n1903, fleeing religious persecution in France, the Sisters arrived in the United States \nand began a school in Wild Rice, North Dakota and a hospital in Spring Valley, \nIllinois. The Sisters of Mary of the Presentation now have a Provincial home in Valley \nCity, North Dakota, and operate three critical access hospitals in North Dakota, in \naddition to the original hospital in Spring Valley. The Sisters also  operate five \nnursing homes to serve the elderly in North Dakota. Together, these ministries \nconstitute SMP Health System.  \n76.  SMP  Health  System  shares the  religious  beliefs  of its sponsor,  the \nSisters  of  Mary  of  the  Presentation.  The  mission  of  SMP  Health  System  is  to \n“provide[] leadership to its Catholic health care ministries as they work to fulfill the \nhealing mission of Jesus.” SMP Health System’s vision statement explains that “Our \nconcern is for all people, but the poor and elderly have a special claim on us. From \nour limited resources we provide services characterized by excellence, compassion, \nand personalized concern. Because we care, we focus on the needs of the whole person, \nphysical, spiritual, psychological, and social.”  See SMP Health System,  Mission, \nValues,  Vision  and  Philosophy,  http://smphs.org/mission-values-vision-\nphilosophy.html (last visited Nov. 7, 2016).  \n77.  In accordance with this vision and mission, the Sisters of Mary operate \ntheir clinics in a manner that abides by The Ethical and Religious Directives for \nCatholic Healthcare Services, as promulgated by the United States Conference of \nCatholic Bishops and interpreted by the local Bishop. The Sisters of Mary strive to \n29 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-RRE-ARS   Document 1   Filed 11/07/16   Page 30 of 82\n“provide quality patient care in an environment that contributes to the healing of the \nwhole person.” \n78.  This new Rule will impact SMP Health System by 1) requiring SMP \nHealth System to offer medical services that violate its best medical judgment and \nreligious beliefs, and 2) requiring SMP Health System to provide insurance coverage \nfor services that violate its religious beliefs.  \n1.  Compulsory Medical Services \n79.  SMP Health System provides all of its standard medical services to \nevery individual who needs and qualifies for its care, including to individuals who \nidentify as transgender. Thus, for instance, if a transgender individual comes in with \nhigh blood pressure or a diabetes diagnosis, SMP Health System would provide the \nsame full spectrum of compassionate care for that individual as they provide for every \nother patient. And, just as they do for every other patient, SMP Health System would \nappropriately tailor that care to the biologically sex-specific health needs of the \npatient.  \n80.  SMP Health System holds religious beliefs that sexual identity is an \nobjective fact rooted in nature as male or female persons. Like the Catholic Church it \nserves, SMP Health System believes that every man and woman is created in the \nimage and likeness of God and that they reflect God’s image in unique—and uniquely \ndignified—ways.  \n81.  In SMP Health System’s best medical judgment, providing or assisting \nwith gender transition services is not in keeping with the best interests of its patients.  \n30 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-RRE-ARS   Document 1   Filed 11/07/16   Page 31 of 82\n82.  Providing such services would also substantially burden the religious \nexercise of SMP Health System.  \n83.  Accordingly, after careful review of the issue, SMP Health System made \nthe decision not to provide, perform, or otherwise facilitate medical transitions. To \nprovide or otherwise facilitate those services would also violate SMP Health System’s \nreligious beliefs.  \n84.  The SMP Health System physicians and facilities offer services such as \nhysterectomies, mastectomies, endocrinology services, and psychiatric support. SMP \nHealth System physicians also offer endocrinology services to pediatric patients in \ncertain contexts. The new Rule would force SMP Health System to offer these services \nas  a  part  of  a  medical  transition,  which  would  violate  both  their  best  medical \njudgment and their religious beliefs.  \n85.  This Rule also chills the speech of SMP Health System physicians who \nwish to discuss their medical opinions with their patients and offer medical advice \nfreely.  \n86.  Some of the procedures required under the Rule, including  elective \nhysterectomies, can result in the sterilization of the patient. Since  SMP Health \nSystem does not believe hysterectomies for the purpose of gender transition are \nmedically necessary, being forced to provide such procedures would violate SMP \nHealth System’s best medical judgment and religious beliefs.  \n87.  The Rule also prohibits discrimination on the basis of “termination of \npregnancy.” In certain contexts, SMP Health System performs surgical procedures \n31 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-RRE-ARS   Document 1   Filed 11/07/16   Page 32 of 82\nfor  women  who  have  miscarried  a  baby,  such  as  dilation  and  curettage  (D&C) \nprocedures. However, SMP Health System would be unwilling to offer the same \nservice if the goal of the procedure was to terminate a pregnancy. The Rule forces \nSMP Health System to provide abortion-related procedures in violation of its best \nmedical judgment and religious beliefs.  \n2.  Required Insurance Coverage \n88.  SMP Health System offers health benefits to its full time employees.  \n89.  SMP Health System offers its employees a self-insured plan in Illinois, \nadministered by a third-party administrator, and a fully insured plan in North \nDakota.  \n90.  In accordance with SMP Health System’s religious beliefs, the employee \nbenefits plans specifically exclude coverage for:  \n  Gender transition surgeries and treatment leading to and/or related to \nsuch surgeries; \n  Sterilizations; \n  Abortions. \n91.  SMP  Health  System  sincerely  believes  that  providing  insurance \ncoverage  for  gender  transition,  sterilization,  and  abortion  would  constitute \nimpermissible material cooperation with evil.  \n92.  SMP Health System must now choose between (a) following its faith and \nits best medical judgment, or (b) following the Regulation. If it follows its faith and \nmedical judgment, SMP Health System will be subject to financial penalties and \nlawsuits. Most significantly, SMP Health System annually provides a substantial \n32 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-RRE-ARS   Document 1   Filed 11/07/16   Page 33 of 82\namount of services to poor, disabled, and elderly Medicare and Medicaid patients. If \nSMP Health System refuses to both deny its faith and lower its standard of care, it \nrisks losing that funding and suffering a crippling blow to its capacity to carry out its \nreligious mission to serve the poor, disabled, and elderly.  \nF.   The Effect on University of Mary  \n93.  The University of Mary has a long tradition of carrying out the mission \nof Jesus Christ through education. In 1878, a brave group of Benedictine Sisters \narrived in Dakota Territory to bring ministries of healing and learning, founding \nschools and hospitals to serve the community.  \n94.  In 1959, the Benedictine Sisters of the Annunciation founded Mary \nCollege, offering degrees in education and nursing.  The college expanded and added \nadditional programs. In the 1980s, it added its first graduate program, in nursing, \nand became the University of Mary.  \n95.  The University strives to infuse all of its programs with Christian, \nCatholic, Benedictine values to prepare its students to be ethical leaders in their \ncareers and their communities. The University welcomes students of all faiths and \nbackgrounds and, as is fundamental to its mission, upholds Catholic teaching in all \nof its programs and services.  \n96.  For example, the University’s freshman and sophomore students are \nrequired to live on campus. The University residence life program has been designed \nto be a co-curricular student learning program. The program is structured to help \nstudents learn by participating in a residence life community where the programming \n33 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-RRE-ARS   Document 1   Filed 11/07/16   Page 34 of 82\nand policies are designed to encourage students to practice Christian virtues and the \nUniversity’s Benedictine values.  \n97.  The University has a long history of offering medical education inspired \nby its Catholic faith. For example, the University is one of only a few in the United \nStates to offer a master’s degree in bioethics, designed to help professionals make \nmorally sound decisions about responsible use of biomedical advances. The program \nis offered in partnership with the National Catholic Bioethics Center. \n98.  As it has since its founding, the University offers a nursing program. It \nprovides several nursing degrees at the undergraduate, graduate and doctoral level. \nThe University’s nursing program on June 17, 2016 received a three-year grant for \nover $1 million from the Department of Health and Human Services. That grant is \nintended to aid in training nurses to improve rural healthcare in North Dakota.  \n99.  The  University  also  has  a  student  health  clinic  that  operates  in \naccordance with the Ethical and Religious Directives of the United States Conference \nof Catholic Bishops. \n100.  As a result of the receipt of funds administered by HHS, the University \nis subject to the new Rule promulgated by the Department.  \n101.  The University has over 360 employees. Approximately 347 of these \nemployees are eligible for health insurance benefits from the University.  \n102.  The  University  operates  a  self-funded  health  plan  which  provides \ncoverage  for  its  employees  through  a  third-party  administrator.  The  same  plan \n34 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-RRE-ARS   Document 1   Filed 11/07/16   Page 35 of 82\nprovides coverage for all employees, whether in the nursing program or outside the \nnursing program.  \n103.  In keeping with the University’s Catholic beliefs, that plan excludes \ncoverage for:  \n  “Treatment  leading  to  or  in  connection  with  sex  change  or \ntransformation surgery and related complications”; \n  Sterilization; \n  Abortion. \n104.  The University sincerely believes that providing insurance coverage for \ngender transitions, sterilization, or abortion would constitute impermissible \nmaterial cooperation with evil.  \n105.  The University must now choose between (a) following its faith, or (b) \nfollowing the Regulation. If it follows its faith, the University will be subject to \nfinancial penalties and lawsuits, including loss of its funding to train nurses in rural \nNorth Dakota, an important part of its religious mission to serve the religious, \nacademic, and cultural needs of its students and the people of its region.  \n106.  The Regulation also makes it more expensive for the University to do \nbusiness with its third-party administrator. The Regulation subjects the third-party \nadministrator to potential liability for administering the University’s religious health \nplan, and thus the University will likely be required to indemnify its third-party \nadministrator from this liability. This constitutes an additional substantial burden \non its religious exercise.  \n35 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-RRE-ARS   Document 1   Filed 11/07/16   Page 36 of 82\nG.   The New Rule’s Impact on North Dakota. \n107.  The  new  Regulation  runs  headlong  into  established  standards  of \nmedical care, usurps North Dakota’s legitimate authority over its medical facilities, \nand makes it impossible for North Dakota to comply with conflicting federal law, \namong other harms.   \n1.  Standard of Care.  \n108.  “[T]he State has a significant role to play in regulating the medical \nprofession,” Gonzales v. Carhart, 550 U.S. 124, 157 (2007), as well as “an interest in \nprotecting  the  integrity  and  ethics  of  the  medical  profession.”  Washington  v. \nGlucksberg, 521 U.S. 702, 731 (1997). This includes “maintaining high standards of \nprofessional conduct” in the practice of medicine. Barsky v. Bd. of Regents of Univ., \n347 U.S. 442, 451 (1954). \n109.  North  Dakota,  for  example,  actively  protects  the  physician-patient \nrelationship and the ability of doctors to exercise independent medical judgment in \nservice of their patients.  \n110.  Every person should be treated with dignity and respect, especially \nwhen in need of medical attention. The standard of care established in North Dakota, \nand around the country, enables patients to obtain quality healthcare as determined \nby medical professionals, and not those outside the doctor-patient relationship. The \nRegulation, however, usurps this standard of care. It discards independent medical \njudgment and a physician’s duty to his or her patient’s permanent well-being and \nreplaces them with rigid commands.  \n36 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-RRE-ARS   Document 1   Filed 11/07/16   Page 37 of 82\n111.  The Regulation will force physicians who accept Medicare and Medicaid \npayments and who operate, offer, or contract for health programs and activities that \nreceive  Federal  financial  assistance  to  subject  their  patients  to  procedures that \npermanently alter or remove well-functioning organs, even though the physicians’ \nindependent medical judgment advises against such a course of action. And beyond \ncompelling physicians to act against their medical judgment, the Regulation requires \nthem to express opinions contrary to what they deem to be in the patient’s best \ninterest  or  to  avoid  even  describing  medical  transition  procedures  as  risky  or \nexperimental.  Patients  deserve  better—and  are  treated  more  humanely—under \nState law.    \n2.  Control over Facilities.   \n112.  Every State provides healthcare services directly to citizens through \nvarious mechanisms of government. North Dakota, for example, provides health \nservices through the North Dakota Department of Human Services, which, among \nother things, operates the North Dakota State Hospital, a state-run hospital that \naccepts HHS-administered funds. \n113.  These covered entities, which exist across the country, will now be \ncovered under the Regulation with respect to “all of the operations” of such entities. \nThus, these entities will have to offer all manner of (and referrals for) medical \ntransition procedures and treatments. As a result, North Dakota will be forced to \nallocate  personnel,  resources,  and  facility  spaces  to  offer  and  accommodate  the \nmyriad medical transition procedures now required to be performed under the new \n37 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-RRE-ARS   Document 1   Filed 11/07/16   Page 38 of 82\nRule. Healthcare facilities will also be required to open up sex-separated showers, \nlocker rooms, or other facilities based on individual preference. This is true even in \ncontrolled medical locations where patient access to intimate facilities is often under \nthe control of healthcare professionals that are supposed to act in the best interests \nof the patient. Thus, the requirements of the new Rule amount to a substantial \ninterference in the control that North Dakota and other States legitimately exercise \nover their healthcare facilities.  \n3.  Conflicting Federal Law.   \n114.  Title  VII  of  the  Civil  Rights  Act  of  1964  (“Title  VII”)  prohibits \nemployment discrimination based on religion. 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2. To comply with \nTitle VII, employers must reasonably accommodate an employee’s religious belief, \nobservance, or practice unless such accommodation imposes an undue hardship on \nthe employer’s business. Id. at § 2000e-1; EEOC v. Abercrombie & Fitch Stores, Inc., \n135 S. Ct. 2028, 2032 (2015) (providing that Title VII requires reasonable religious \naccommodations).  \n115.  But the Regulation in many circumstances makes such accommodation \nillegal, placing employers between a legal Scylla and Charybdis. On the one hand, \nemployers are required under Title VII to reasonably accommodate their employees’ \nreligious and conscientious objections. On the other hand, the Regulation requires \nmedical employers to provide (or refer for) medical transition procedures even when \ndoing so would violate the religious or conscientious objections or concerns of its \nemployees. HHS refused to affirm the principles of religious accommodation in its \n38 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-RRE-ARS   Document 1   Filed 11/07/16   Page 39 of 82\nnew Rule even when asked to do so. Thus, it forces employers like North Dakota to \nchoose between violating the Regulation or violating Title VII.  \n4.  Additional Harms.  \n116.  The Regulation is costly and burdensome on North Dakota for a variety \nof additional reasons, to wit:  \n117.  North  Dakota  operates  as  an  employer  that  offers  covered  health \nbenefits to its employees and their families through its constituent agencies. The new \nRule will require North Dakota to provide insurance coverage for medical transition \nprocedures.  \n118.  The new Rule also purports to require North Dakota to provide abortion \ncoverage through its employee health benefits. HHS states that a State’s Medicaid \nprogram constitutes a covered “health program or activity” under the Rule. Thus, “the \nState will be governed by Section 1557 in the provision of employee health benefits \nfor its Medicaid employees.” 81 Fed. Reg. at 31437.  \n119.  The  exclusions  North  Dakota  currently  possesses  in  its  employee \ninsurance  policies  related  to  pregnancy  termination  and  medical  transition \nprocedures will now be illegal under the new Rule. As a result, North Dakota will be \nrequired to change its insurance coverage.  \n120.  In  order  to  receive  federal  healthcare  funding,  North  Dakota  must \nsubmit assurances, notices of compliance, and other information, demonstrating that \ntheir  health  programs  and  activities  satisfy  the  requirements  imposed  by  the \nRegulation. 81 Fed. Reg. at 31392, 31442.  \n39 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-RRE-ARS   Document 1   Filed 11/07/16   Page 40 of 82\n121.  The costs of personnel training will be significant, even by HHS’s very \nmodest estimates. HHS estimates that 7,637,306 state workers will need to receive \ntraining under the new Rule, and that the cost of this training in the first two years \nof implementation alone will be $17.8 million.  \n122.  The penalties for noncompliance are so severe as to make the Regulation \ncoercive. North Dakota, as an example, faces the loss of significant financial support \nin healthcare funding to serve its most vulnerable citizens.  \n123.  Finally, the new Rule could subject North Dakota to private lawsuits for \ndamages and attorney’s fees, even though North Dakota did not and could not have \nknown or consented to this waiver of its sovereign immunity.  \nIV. CLAIMS \nCOUNT I \n \nViolation of the Administrative Procedure Act \nAgency Action Not in Accordance with Law \n124.  The Plaintiffs incorporate by reference all preceding paragraphs.  \n125.  Defendants are “agencies” under the APA, 5 U.S.C. § 551(1), and the \nnew Regulation complained of herein is a “rule” under the APA, id. § 551(4), and \nconstitutes “[a]gency action made reviewable by statute and final agency action for \nwhich there is no other adequate remedy in a court.” Id. § 704. \n126.  The APA prohibits agency actions that are “not in accordance with law.” \nId. § 706(2)(A). Under the APA, “an agency may not interpret a regulation so as to \nviolate a statute.” Univ. of Iowa Hosps. & Clinics v. Shalala, 180 F.3d 943, 951 (8th \nCir. 1999). In such cases, courts review questions of law de novo. Iowa League of Cities \n40 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-RRE-ARS   Document 1   Filed 11/07/16   Page 41 of 82\nv. EPA, 711 F.3d 844, 872 (8th Cir. 2013). The Regulation is not in accordance with \nlaw for a number of independent reasons.  \n127.  HHS  has  explained  that  the  Regulation  will  require  physicians  to \nperform medical transition procedures regardless of whether those procedures are \n“medically necessary” or even “medically appropriate.” It is not in accordance with \nlaw, within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), for the federal government to require \nmedical  professionals  to  perform  procedures  that  may  not  be  necessary  or \nappropriate, and may in fact be harmful to the patients. This violates constitutional \nand statutory rights of medical professionals, including substantive due process \nrights and freedom of speech protections, as well as the sovereign prerogatives of the \nStates,  which  play  a  significant  role  in  overseeing  the  promulgation  and \nadministration of appropriate standards of care within the healthcare community. \nCourts  scrutinize  particularly  closely  agency  action  that  raises  constitutional \nconcerns.   \n128.  The Regulation also states that a physician’s view of medical transition \nprocedures as “experimental” is “outdated and not based on current standards of \ncare.” 81 Fed. Reg. at 31435; see also id. at 31429.  It is not in accordance with law, \nwithin the meaning of 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), for the federal government to dictate \nappropriate medical views on the necessity and experimental nature of  medical \ntransition procedures, and to dictate what constitutes best standards of care in an \narea of science and medicine that is being hotly debated in the medical community. \n41 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-RRE-ARS   Document 1   Filed 11/07/16   Page 42 of 82\nThis violates constitutional and statutory rights of medical professionals, including \nsubstantive due process rights and freedom of speech protections. \n129.  The Regulation is not in accordance with Section 1557 of the Affordable \nCare Act (42 U.S.C. § 18116) or Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, 20 \nU.S.C. § 1681 et seq. Section 1557 does not, on its own terms, prohibit discrimination \non the basis of “sex.” Instead, it prohibits discrimination “on the ground prohibited \nunder . . . title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972.” 42 U.S.C. § 18116(a). Title \nIX, in turn, prohibits discrimination “on the basis of sex . . . except that . . . this section \nshall  not  apply  to  an  educational  institution  which  is  controlled  by  a  religious \norganization if the application of this subsection would not be consistent with the \nreligious tenets of such organization.” 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a)-(a)(3). \n130.  Neither Section 1557 nor Title IX uses the term “sex” to include “gender \nidentity.” Thus, HHS’s attempt to expand the definition is not in accordance with law \nwithin the meaning of 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).  \n131.  HHS’s failure to include in the Regulation a religious exemption that \nparallels the religious exemption in Title IX is also not in accordance with law within \nthe meaning of 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).  \n132.  HHS’s failure to include an exclusion for sterilization and sterilization-\nrelated  services  is  not  in  accordance  with  law  within  the  meaning  of  5  U.S.C. \n§ 706(2)(A) because it is inconsistent with the Church Amendments, 42 U.S.C. § 300a-\n7(b), which protect the right of healthcare entities who receive federal funding to \nrefuse to participate in or assist with sterilizations.  \n42 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-RRE-ARS   Document 1   Filed 11/07/16   Page 43 of 82\n133.  HHS’s failure to include an exclusion for abortion and abortion-related \nservices is not in accordance with law within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A) \nbecause  it  is  inconsistent  with  the  plain  language  of  Title  IX,  which  prohibits \nrequiring coverage, payment, or the use of facilities for abortion. \n134.  HHS’s failure to include an exclusion for abortion and abortion-related \nservices is not in accordance with law within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A) \nbecause it is inconsistent with the Church Amendments, 42 U.S.C. §300a-7(b), which \nprotect the right of healthcare entities who receive federal funding to refuse to \nparticipate in or assist with abortions. \n135.  HHS’s failure to include an exclusion for abortion and abortion-related \nservices is not in accordance with law within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A) \nbecause it is inconsistent with Section 245 of the Public Health Service Act, 42 U.S.C. \n§ 238(n), which prohibits the federal government and any state or local government \nreceiving federal financial assistance from discriminating against any healthcare \nentity on the basis that the entity refuses to perform abortions, provide referrals for \nabortions, or to make arrangements for such abortions.  \n136.  HHS’s failure to include an exclusion for abortion and abortion-related \nservices is not in accordance with law within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A) \nbecause it is inconsistent with the Weldon Amendment, which has been readopted or \nincorporated by reference in every HHS appropriations act since 2005,31 and provides \n                                                 \n31 See Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016, H.R. 2029, 114th Cong. § 507(d) \n(2015).  \n43 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-RRE-ARS   Document 1   Filed 11/07/16   Page 44 of 82\nthat no funds may be made available under HHS appropriations act to a government \nentity that discriminates against an institution or individual physician or healthcare \nprofessional on the basis that the entity or individual “does not provide, pay for, \nprovide coverage of, or refer for abortions.”  \n137.  HHS’s failure to include an exclusion for abortion and abortion-related \nservices is not in accordance with law within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A) \nbecause it is inconsistent with Section 1303(b)(4) of the ACA, 42 U.S.C. § 18023(b)(4), \nwhich states that “[n]o qualified health plan offered through an Exchange may \ndiscriminate  against  any  individual  health  care  provider  or  health  care  facility \nbecause of its unwillingness to provide, pay for, provide coverage of, or refer for \nabortions.” \n138.  The Regulation is not in accordance with Title VII of the Civil Rights \nAct  of  1964  (42  U.S.C. § 2000e  et  seq.).  Title  VII  prohibits  employers  from \ndiscriminating against employees on the basis of religion. 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2. This \nmeans that employers, including Plaintiffs, have a duty to reasonably accommodate \ntheir employees’ religious practices unless doing so would cause undue hardship to \nthe  employer.  Plaintiffs  employ  individuals  who  have  religious  or  conscientious \nobjections to performing medical transition procedures. It should not be an undue \nhardship on Plaintiffs to accommodate these employees’ religious beliefs, but the new \nRegulation will in many cases make it illegal for Plaintiffs who receive HHS funds to \naccommodate their employees in accordance with Title VII. Thus, the Regulation is \nnot in accordance with Title VII. \n44 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-RRE-ARS   Document 1   Filed 11/07/16   Page 45 of 82\n139.  The Regulation states that  a physician’s view of medical transition \nprocedures as “experimental” is “outdated and not based on current standards of \ncare.” 81 Fed. Reg. at 31435; see also id. at 31429. It is not in accordance with law \nwithin the meaning of 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A) for the federal government to dictate \nappropriate medical views on the necessity and experimental nature of  medical \ntransition procedures, and to dictate what constitutes best standards of care and \nwhat services physicians must offer in an area of science and medicine that is being \nhotly debated in the medical community. This violates constitutional and statutory \nrights of medical professionals, including a medical professional’s freedom of speech \nto offer candid professional advice about the experimental nature and dangerous \nhealth outcomes associated with medical transition procedures, and freedom not to \nbe compelled to speak in favor of or make referrals for such procedures. \n140.  The Regulation also forces physicians to provide medical services related \nto gender transition. This is not in accordance with substantive due process rights \nprotecting a medical professional’s right to not perform a procedure he or she believes \nto be experimental, ethically questionable, and potentially harmful. \n141.  The Regulation is not in accordance with the First Amendment because \nthe Regulation is overbroad and not narrowly tailored to a compelling governmental \ninterest. \n142.  The Regulation is not in accordance with the First Amendment and \nFifth Amendment because it is void for vagueness.  \n45 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-RRE-ARS   Document 1   Filed 11/07/16   Page 46 of 82\n143.  The Regulation is not in accordance with the First Amendment because \nit violates Plaintiffs’ rights not to be subjected to a system of unbridled discretion \nwhen engaging in speech or religious exercise. \n144.  The Regulation is not in accordance with the Tenth Amendment, which \nprohibits the federal government from co-opting a state’s control over budgetary \nprocesses and legislative agendas. \n145.  The Regulation is contrary to the First Amendment because it imposes \nan unconstitutional condition on Plaintiffs’ receipt of federal funding. See Agency for \nInt’l Dev. v. All. for Open Soc’y Int’l, Inc., 133 S. Ct. 2321, 2331 (2013). \n146.  The Regulation is contrary to the First Amendment because violates \nPlaintiffs’ freedom of association protections.  \n147.  The Regulation  is  contrary  to law  because  it  violates the  Religious \nFreedom Restoration Act. \n148.  The Regulation is contrary to law because it violates the Free Exercise \nclause of the First Amendment. \n149.  The  Regulation  is  contrary  to  law  because  it  violates  the  Fifth \nAmendment Due Process and Equal Protection clauses. \n150.  The Regulation is contrary to the protections of the Spending Clause.  \n151.  The Regulation is an unlawful abrogation of sovereign immunity under \nthe Eleventh Amendment.  \n152.  The Regulation is contrary to the protections of the Tenth Amendment.  \n46 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-RRE-ARS   Document 1   Filed 11/07/16   Page 47 of 82\n153.  Plaintiffs have no adequate or available administrative remedy, or, in \nthe alternative, any effort to obtain an administrative remedy would be futile. \n154.  Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law. \n155.  Absent injunctive and declaratory relief against the Regulation, the \nPlaintiffs have been and will continue to be harmed. \nCOUNT II \n \nViolation of the Administrative Procedure Act \nAgency Action In Excess of Statutory Authority and Limitations \n156.  The Plaintiffs incorporate by reference all preceding paragraphs.  \n157.  Defendants are “agencies” under the APA, 5 U.S.C. § 551(1), and the \nnew Regulation complained of herein is a “rule” under the APA, id. § 551(4), and \nconstitutes “[a]gency action made reviewable by statute and final agency action for \nwhich there is no other adequate remedy in a court.” Id. § 704. \n158.  The  APA  prohibits  agency  actions  that  are  “in  excess  of  statutory \njurisdiction, authority, or limitations.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(C). The Regulation is in \nexcess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, and limitations for a number of reasons.  \n159.  For the reasons described above, there is no statutory authority or \njurisdiction  for  HHS  to  require  medical  professionals  and  facilities  to  perform \nprocedures (or refer for the same) that may not be necessary or appropriate, and may \nin fact be harmful to the patients.  \n160.  For the reasons described above, there is no statutory authority or \njurisdiction  for  HHS  to  dictate  appropriate  medical  views  on  the  necessity  and \nexperimental nature of medical transition procedures, or to dictate what constitutes \n47 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-RRE-ARS   Document 1   Filed 11/07/16   Page 48 of 82\nbest standards of care in an area of science and medicine that is being hotly debated \nin the medical community. \n161.

For the reasons described above, HHS’s failure to include a religious \nexemption in the Regulation that parallels the religious exemption in Title IX is in \nexcess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, and limitations within the meaning of 5 \nU.S.C. § 706(2)(C).  \n163.  For the reasons discussed above, HHS’s failure to include an exclusion \nfor sterilization and sterilization-related services is in excess of statutory jurisdiction, \nauthority, and limitations within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(C) because it is \ninconsistent with the Church Amendments, 42 U.S.C. § 300a-7(b). \n164.

For the reasons discussed above, the Regulation is in excess of statutory \njurisdiction, authority, and limitations within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(C) \nbecause it is an unlawful abrogation of sovereign immunity.  \n184.  For the reasons discussed above, the Regulation is in excess of statutory \njurisdiction, authority, and limitations within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(C) \nbecause it is contrary to the protections of the Tenth Amendment.  \n185.  Plaintiffs have no adequate or available administrative remedy, or, in \nthe alternative, any effort to obtain an administrative remedy would be futile. \n186.  Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law. \n187.  Absent injunctive and declaratory relief against the Regulation, the \nPlaintiffs have been and will continue to be harmed. \nCOUNT III \n \nViolation of the Administrative Procedure Act \nAgency Action that is Arbitrary, Capricious and an Abuse of Discretion \n188.  The Plaintiffs incorporate by reference all preceding paragraphs.  \n189.  Defendants are “agencies” under the APA, 5 U.S.C. § 551(1), and the \nnew Regulation complained of herein is a “rule” under the APA, id. § 551(4), and \nconstitutes “[a]gency action made reviewable by statute and final agency action for \nwhich there is no other adequate remedy in a court.” Id. § 704. \n52 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-RRE-ARS   Document 1   Filed 11/07/16   Page 53 of 82\n190.  The APA prohibits agency actions that are “arbitrary, capricious, [or] an \nabuse of discretion.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). The Regulation is arbitrary and capricious \nagency action for a number of reasons.  \n191.  HHS  has  explained  that  the  Regulation  will  require  physicians  to \nperform medical transition procedures regardless of whether those procedures are \n“medically necessary” or even “medically appropriate.” It is arbitrary and capricious \nfor the federal government to require medical professionals to perform (or refer for) \nprocedures that the physician believes may not be necessary or appropriate, and that \nmay even be harmful to the patient. \n192.  For the reasons discussed above, it is arbitrary and capricious for HHS \nto dictate appropriate medical views on the necessity and experimental nature of \nmedical transition procedures, and to dictate what constitutes best standards of care. \n193.  For the reasons discussed above, HHS’s inclusion of “gender identity” in \nits interpretation of “sex” is an arbitrary and capricious interpretation of Section 1557 \nof  the  Affordable  Care  Act  (42  U.S.C. § 18116)  and  Title  IX  of  the  Education \nAmendments of 1972, 20 U.S.C. § 1681 et seq.  \n194.  For the reasons discussed above, HHS’s failure to include a religious \nexemption in the Regulation that parallels the religious exemption in Title IX is \narbitrary and capricious within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).  \n195.  For the reasons discussed above, HHS’s failure to include an exclusion \nfor sterilization and sterilization-related services is arbitrary and capricious within \n53 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-RRE-ARS   Document 1   Filed 11/07/16   Page 54 of 82\nthe  meaning  of  5  U.S.C. § 706(2)(A)  because  it  is  inconsistent  with  the  Church \nAmendments, 42 U.S.C. § 300a-7(b). \n196.  For the reasons discussed above, HHS’s failure to include an exclusion \nfor abortion and abortion-related services is arbitrary and capricious within the \nmeaning of 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \n197.  For the reasons described above, HHS’s decision to require Plaintiffs to \nact  in  violation  of  Title  VII  by  not  accommodating  their  employees’  religious \nobjections  to  participating  in  medical  transition  procedures  is  arbitrary  and \ncapricious within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \n198.  For  the  reasons  discussed  above,  the  Regulation  is  arbitrary  and \ncapricious within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A) as it violates Plaintiffs’ freedom \nof speech. \n199.  For  the  reasons  discussed  above,  the  Regulation  is  arbitrary  and \ncapricious  within  the  meaning  of  5  U.S.C. § 706(2)(A)  as  it  violates  Plaintiffs’ \nsubstantive due process rights.  \n200.  For  the  reasons  discussed  above,  the  Regulation  is  arbitrary  and \ncapricious  within  the  meaning  of  5  U.S.C. § 706(2)(A)  as  it  violates  the  First \nAmendment  because  it  is  overbroad  and  not  narrowly  tailored  to  a  compelling \ngovernmental interest. \n201.  For  the  reasons  discussed  above,  the  Regulation  is  arbitrary  and \ncapricious within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A) because it is void under the \nFirst and Fifth Amendment for vagueness.  \n54 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-RRE-ARS   Document 1   Filed 11/07/16   Page 55 of 82\n202.  For  the  reasons  discussed  above,  the  Regulation  is  arbitrary  and \ncapricious within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A) because it violates Plaintiffs’ \nrights not to be subjected to a system of unbridled discretion when engaging in speech \nor when engaging in religious exercise, as secured to them by the First Amendment \nof the United States Constitution. \n203.  For  the  reasons  discussed  above,  the  Regulation  is  arbitrary  and \ncapricious  within  the  meaning  of  5  U.S.C. § 706(2)(A)  because  it  co-opts  States’ \ncontrol  over  budgetary  processes  and  legislative  agendas  contrary  to  the  Tenth \nAmendment. \n204.  For  the  reasons  discussed  above,  the  Regulation  is  arbitrary  and \ncapricious  within  the  meaning  of  5  U.S.C. § 706(2)(A)  because  it  imposes  an \nunconstitutional condition on Plaintiffs’ receipt of federal funding contrary to the \nFirst Amendment.  \n205.  The Regulation is arbitrary and capricious within the meaning of 5 \nU.S.C. § 706(2)(A)  because  it  violates  Plaintiffs’  First  Amendment  freedom  of \nassociation.  \n206.  For  the  reasons  discussed  above,  the  Regulation  is  arbitrary  and \ncapricious within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A) because it violates the Religious \nFreedom Restoration Act. \n207.  For  the  reasons  discussed  above,  the  Regulation  is  arbitrary  and \ncapricious within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A) because it violates the Free \nExercise Clause of the First Amendment. \n55 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-RRE-ARS   Document 1   Filed 11/07/16   Page 56 of 82\n208.  For  the  reasons  discussed  above,  the  Regulation  is  arbitrary  and \ncapricious within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A) because it violates the Fifth \nAmendment Due Process and Equal Protection clauses. \n209.  For  the  reasons  discussed  above,  the  Regulation  is  arbitrary  and \ncapricious within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A) because it is contrary to the \nprotections of the Spending Clause.  \n210.  For  the  reasons  discussed  above,  the  Regulation  is  arbitrary  and \ncapricious within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A) because it is an unlawful \nabrogation of sovereign immunity.  \n211.  For  the  reasons  discussed  above,  the  Regulation  is  arbitrary  and \ncapricious within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A) because it is contrary to the \nprotections of the Tenth Amendment.  \n212.  Plaintiffs have no adequate or available administrative remedy, or, in \nthe alternative, any effort to obtain an administrative remedy would be futile. \n213.  Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law. \n214.  Absent injunctive and declaratory relief against the Regulation, the \nPlaintiffs have been and will continue to be harmed. \nCOUNT IV \nViolation of the First Amendment of the United States Constitution \nFreedom of Speech \nCompelled Speech and Compelled Silence \n \n215.  The Plaintiffs incorporate by reference all preceding paragraphs. \n56 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-RRE-ARS   Document 1   Filed 11/07/16   Page 57 of 82\n216.  The Plaintiffs plan to continue using their best medical and ethical \njudgment in treating and advising patients. Performing (or referring for) medical \ntransition procedures is contrary to their best medical and/or ethical judgment.  \n217.  The Regulation states, in the context of physicians offering “health \nservices”  that  a  “categorization  of  all  transition-related  treatment  .  .  .  as \nexperimental, is outdated and not based on current standards of care.” 81 Fed. Reg. \nat 31435; see also id. at 31429.  \n218.  The  Regulation  would  prohibit  the  Plaintiffs  from  expressing  their \nprofessional opinions that medical transition procedures are not the best standard of \ncare or are experimental. \n219.  The Regulation would also require Plaintiffs to amend their written \npolicies to expressly endorse gender transition procedures, even if such revisions do \nnot reflect the medical judgment, values, or beliefs of Plaintiffs. Id. at 31455. The \nregulation would also require Plaintiffs to use gender-transition affirming language \nin all situations, regardless of circumstance. Id. at 31406.  \n220.  Performing  (or  referring  for)  medical  transition  procedures  is  also \ncontrary to the religious and conscientious beliefs of the Plaintiffs, and their beliefs \nprohibit them from conducting, participating in, or referring for such procedures.  \n221.  The Regulation would compel the Plaintiffs to conduct, participate in, \nrefer for, or otherwise facilitate medical transition procedures.  \n57 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-RRE-ARS   Document 1   Filed 11/07/16   Page 58 of 82\n222.  The  Regulation  would  prohibit  the  Plaintiffs  from  expressing  their \nreligious views that medical transition procedures are not the best standard of care \nor are experimental.  \n223.  The Regulation would compel the Plaintiffs to speak in ways that they \nwould not otherwise speak.  \n224.  The  Regulation  thus  violates  the  Plaintiffs  right  to  be  free  from \ncompelled speech as secured to them by the First Amendment of the United States \nConstitution.  \n225.  The Regulation’s compelled speech requirement is not justified by a \ncompelling governmental interest.  \n226.  Even if HHS has a compelling government interest, the Regulation is \nnot narrowly tailored to achieve that interest.  \n227.  Absent injunctive and declaratory relief against the Regulation, the \nPlaintiffs have been and will continue to be harmed.  \nCOUNT V \n \nViolation of the First Amendment of the United States Constitution \nFreedom of Speech and Free Exercise Clause \nViewpoint Discrimination \n \n228.  The Plaintiffs incorporate by reference all preceding paragraphs.  \n229.  The Plaintiffs’ sincere religious and conscientious beliefs prohibit them \nfrom facilitating or participating in medical transition procedures.  \n230.  The Plaintiffs’ medical judgment is that, in general, it is harmful to \nencourage a patient to undergo medical transition procedures.  \n58 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-RRE-ARS   Document 1   Filed 11/07/16   Page 59 of 82\n231.  The Regulation states, in the context of physicians offering “health \nservices” that a “categorization of all transition-related treatment, for example as \nexperimental, is outdated and not based on current standards of care.” 81 Fed. Reg. \nat 31435; see also id. at 31429.  \n232.  The  Regulation  would  prohibit  the  Plaintiffs  from  expressing  their \nreligious or conscientious viewpoint that medical transition procedures are not the \nbest standard of care.  \n233.  The  Regulation  withholds  funding  based  on  an  intent  to  restrict \nPlaintiffs’ speech.  \n234.  The  Regulation’s  viewpoint  discrimination  is  not  justified  by  a \ncompelling governmental interest.  \n235.  Even if HHS has a compelling government interest, the Regulation is \nnot narrowly tailored to achieve that interest.  \n236.  Defendants’ actions thus violate the Plaintiffs rights as secured to them \nby the First Amendment of the United States Constitution.  \n237.  Absent injunctive and declaratory relief against the Regulation, the \nPlaintiffs have been and will continue to be harmed.  \nCOUNT VI \nViolation of the First and Fifth Amendments of the United States \nConstitution \nFreedom of Speech and Due Process \nOverbreadth \n \n238.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference all preceding paragraphs.  \n239.  The Regulation regulates protected speech.  \n59 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-RRE-ARS   Document 1   Filed 11/07/16   Page 60 of 82\n240.  The Regulation states, in the context of physicians offering “health \nservices”  that  a  “categorization  of  all  transition-related  treatment  .  .  .  as \nexperimental, is outdated and not based on current standards of care.” 81 Fed. Reg. \nat 31435; see also id. at 31429.  \n241.  This exposes the Plaintiffs to penalties for expressing their medical and \nmoral views of medical transition procedures. It also prohibits Plaintiffs from using \ntheir medical judgment to determine the appropriate standard of care for interactions \nwith their patients.  \n242.  Plaintiffs believe that the Regulation restricts their speech regarding \nthe best standard of care for patients.  \n243.  The Regulation states: “The determination of whether a certain practice \nis discriminatory typically requires a nuanced analysis that is fact-dependent.” Id. at \n31377. \n244.  The Regulation chills the Plaintiffs’ speech.  \n245.  The  Regulation’s  overbreadth  is  not  justified  by  a  compelling \ngovernmental interest.  \n246.  Even if HHS has a compelling government interest, the Regulation is \nnot narrowly tailored to achieve that interest.  \n247.  Defendants have therefore violated the Plaintiffs’ rights secured to them \nby the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment and the Due Process Clause of \nthe Fifth Amendment by prohibiting speech that would otherwise be protected.  \n60 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-RRE-ARS   Document 1   Filed 11/07/16   Page 61 of 82\n248.  Absent injunctive and declaratory relief against the Regulation, the \nPlaintiffs have been and will continue to be harmed.  \nCOUNT VII \nViolation of the First and Fifth Amendments of the United States \nConstitution \nFreedom of Speech and Due Process \nVoid for Vagueness \n \n249.  The Plaintiffs incorporate by reference all preceding paragraphs.  \n250.  The  Regulation  requires  that  a  covered  entity  apply  “neutral, \nnondiscriminatory  criteria  that  it  uses  for  other  conditions  when  the  coverage \ndetermination is related to gender transition” and “decline[s] to limit application of \nthe  rule  by  specifying  that  coverage  for  the  health  services  addressed \nin § 92.207(b)(3)-(5) must be provided only when the services are medically necessary \nor medically appropriate.” 81 Fed. Reg. at 31435.  \n251.  Without  allowing  Plaintiffs  to  use  their  judgment  about  what  is \nmedically necessary or appropriate, the Regulation is ambiguous in the types of \nservices Plaintiffs are required to provide and perform.  \n252.  Requiring the Plaintiffs apply “neutral, nondiscriminatory criteria that \nit uses for other conditions” is a subjective standard without a limiting construction. \nId.  \n253.  The Regulation states, in the context of physicians offering “health \nservices” that a “categorization of all transition-related treatment, for example as \nexperimental, is outdated and not based on current standards of care.” Id.; see also \nid. at 31429.  \n61 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-RRE-ARS   Document 1   Filed 11/07/16   Page 62 of 82\n254.  The Regulation does not provide a limiting construction for what the \ncurrent standard of care is, nor does it provide guidance as to how physicians can rely \non their best medical judgment when it conflicts with the Regulation.    \n255.  The Regulation is not justified by a compelling governmental interest.  \n256.  Even if HHS has a compelling government interest, the Regulation is \nnot narrowly tailored to achieve that interest.  \n257.  Because Plaintiffs are unable to determine what kind of procedures and \nservices they will be required to provide and perform, Defendants have violated the \nPlaintiffs’ rights secured to them by the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment \nand the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.  \n258.  Absent injunctive and declaratory relief against the Regulation, the \nPlaintiffs have been and will continue to be harmed.  \nCOUNT VIII \nViolation of the First Amendment of the United States Constitution \nFree Exercise Clause and Freedom of Speech \nUnbridled Discretion \n \n259.  The Plaintiffs incorporate by reference all preceding paragraphs.  \n260.  The Regulation “applies to every health program or activity, any part of \nwhich  receives  Federal  financial  assistance  provided  or  made  available  by  the \nDepartment; every health program or activity administered by the Department; and \nevery health program or activity administered by a Title I entity.” 45 C.F.R. 92.2(a).  \n62 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-RRE-ARS   Document 1   Filed 11/07/16   Page 63 of 82\n261.  The Regulation also states: “The determination of whether a certain \npractice  is  discriminatory  typically  requires  a  nuanced  analysis  that  is  fact-\ndependent.” 81 Fed. Reg. at 31377. \n262.  The Regulation also says: “Insofar as the application of any requirement \nunder this part would violate applicable Federal statutory protections for religious \nfreedom and conscience, such application shall not be required.” 45 C.F.R. 92.2(b)(2). \n263.  Because the Defendants have sole discretion over financial assistance \nprovided or made available, and because Defendants have sole discretion over the \napplication of the Regulation and any religious freedom protection that applies, the \nRegulation vests unbridled discretion over which organizations will have their First \nAmendment interests accommodated.  \n264.  In Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, Congress precluded \ndiscrimination on the basis of “sex” in federally funded education programs, “except \nthat . . . this section shall not apply to an educational institution which is controlled \nby a religious organization if the application of this subsection would not be consistent \nwith the religious tenets of such organization.” 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a)-(a)(3). Defendants \nhave exercised unbridled discretion by declining to apply the clear religious freedom \nprotections of Title IX.  \n265.  In Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, Congress banned sex \ndiscrimination in federally funded education programs, except that it made clear that \n“Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to require or prohibit any person, or public \nor private entity, to provide or pay for any benefit or service, including the use of \n63 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-RRE-ARS   Document 1   Filed 11/07/16   Page 64 of 82\nfacilities, related to an abortion. Nothing in this section shall be construed to permit \na penalty to be imposed on any person or individual because such person or individual \nis seeking or has received any benefit or service related to a legal abortion.” 20 \nU.S.C. § 1688. Defendants have exercised unbridled discretion by declining to apply \nthe clear abortion protections of Title IX.  \n266.  Defendants’ actions therefore violate the Plaintiffs’ rights not to be \nsubjected to a system of unbridled discretion when engaging in speech or when \nengaging in religious exercise, as secured to them by the First Amendment of the \nUnited States Constitution.  \n267.  Absent  injunctive  and  declaratory  relief  against  the  Regulation, \nPlaintiffs have been and will continue to be harmed.  \nCOUNT IX \n \nViolation of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution \nFree Speech Clause \nUnconstitutional Conditions \n \n268.  The Plaintiffs incorporate by reference all preceding paragraphs.  \n269.  The  Regulation  imposes  an  unconstitutional  condition  on  Plaintiffs’ \nreceipt of federal funding. See Agency for Int’l Dev., 133 S. Ct. at 2331. \n270.  The Regulation applies to any healthcare provider who accepts federal \nfunding from any source for any program.  \n271.  The  Regulation  requires  the  Plaintiffs  to  adopt  policies  regarding \nstandards of care for patients that violate Plaintiffs’ religious  and conscientious \n64 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-RRE-ARS   Document 1   Filed 11/07/16   Page 65 of 82\nbeliefs, as well as their medical judgment, and also interfere with the Plaintiffs’ \npractice of medicine.  \n272.  Defendants’ actions therefore impose an unconstitutional condition on \nPlaintiffs’ receipt of federal funding and violate Plaintiffs’ rights as secured to them \nby the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution.  \n273.  Absent  injunctive  and  declaratory  relief  against  the  Regulation, \nPlaintiffs have been and will continue to be harmed.  \nCOUNT X \nViolation of the First Amendment \nFreedom of Speech \nExpressive Association \n \n274.  The Plaintiffs incorporate by reference all preceding paragraphs. \n275.  The  Plaintiffs  believe  and  teach  that  participating  in  actions, \nprocedures, and services with the goal of transitioning from one sex to another violate \ntheir religious beliefs.  \n276.  The  Plaintiffs  believe  and  teach  that  participating  in  actions, \nprocedures, and services that result in elective sterilizations violate their religious \nbeliefs.  \n277.  The  Plaintiffs  believe  and  teach  that  participating  in  actions, \nprocedures, and services related to abortion violate their religious beliefs. \n278.  The Transgender Mandate would compel the Plaintiffs to participate in \nprocedures, services, and activities that contradict the Plaintiffs’ religious beliefs and \nmessage.  \n65 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-RRE-ARS   Document 1   Filed 11/07/16   Page 66 of 82\n279.  The  Transgender  Mandate  would  compel  the  Plaintiffs  to  offer \ninsurance coverage for procedures, services, and activities that violate Plaintiffs’ \nreligious beliefs and message. \n280.  Defendants’  actions  thus  violate  Plaintiffs’  rights  of  expressive \nassociation  as  secured  to  them  by  the  First  Amendment  of  the  United  States \nConstitution.  \n281.  Absent  injunctive  and  declaratory  relief  against  the  Transgender \nMandate, the Plaintiffs have been and will continue to be harmed.  \n282.  The Regulation exposes the Plaintiffs to civil suits that would hold them \nliable for practicing and expressing their sincerely held religious beliefs.  \n283.  The Regulation furthers no compelling governmental interest.  \n284.  The  Regulation  is  not  the  least  restrictive  means  of  furthering \nDefendants’ stated interests. \nCOUNT XI \nViolation of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act \nCompelled Medical Services \n \n285.  The Plaintiffs incorporate by reference all preceding paragraphs.  \n286.  The Religious Plaintiffs’ sincerely held religious beliefs prohibit them \nfrom deliberately offering services and performing (or referring for) operations or \nother procedures required by the Regulation. The Plaintiffs’ compliance with these \nbeliefs is a religious exercise.  \n66 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-RRE-ARS   Document 1   Filed 11/07/16   Page 67 of 82\n287.  The Plaintiffs’ sincerely held religious beliefs prohibit them facilitating \nmedical transition procedures. The Plaintiffs’ compliance with these beliefs is a \nreligious exercise.  \n288.  The Plaintiffs’ sincerely held religious beliefs prohibit them facilitating \nsterilization procedures. The Plaintiffs’ compliance with these beliefs is a religious \nexercise.  \n289.  The Plaintiffs’ sincerely held religious beliefs prohibit them facilitating \nabortion-related services. The Plaintiffs’ compliance with these beliefs is a religious \nexercise.  \n290.  The Regulation creates government-imposed coercive pressure on the \nPlaintiffs to change or violate their religious beliefs.  \n291.  The Regulation chills the Plaintiffs’ religious exercise.  \n292.  The  Regulation  exposes  the  Plaintiffs  to  the  loss  of  substantial \ngovernment funding as a result of their religious exercise.  \n293.  The Regulation exposes the Plaintiffs to substantial penalties under the \nFalse Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. § 3729 et seq.  \n294.  The Regulation exposes the Plaintiffs to criminal penalties under 18 \nU.S.C. § 1035.   \n295.  The Regulation exposes the Plaintiffs to civil suits that would hold them \nliable for practicing their sincerely held religious beliefs.  \n296.  The Regulation thus imposes a substantial burden on the Plaintiffs’ \nreligious exercise.  \n67 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-RRE-ARS   Document 1   Filed 11/07/16   Page 68 of 82\n297.  The Regulation furthers no compelling governmental interest.  \n298.  The  Regulation  is  not  the  least  restrictive  means  of  furthering \nDefendants’ stated interests.  \n299.  The Regulation violates the Plaintiffs rights secured to them by the \nReligious Freedom Restoration Act, 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb et seq.  \nCOUNT XII \nViolation of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act \nCompelled Insurance Coverage  \n \n300.  The Plaintiffs incorporate by reference all preceding paragraphs.  \n301.  For the same reasons discussed above, Plaintiffs’ sincerely held religious \nbeliefs prohibit them from deliberately offering health insurance that would cover \ngender  transition  procedures,  sterilization  procedures,  or  abortion-related \nprocedures.   \n302.  Plaintiffs specifically exclude coverage of any services related to gender \ntransition  procedures,  sterilization  procedures,  or  abortion-related  procedures  in \ntheir insurance plans.  \n303.  The  Plaintiffs’  compliance  with  these  beliefs  by  maintaining  these \nexclusions is a religious exercise.  \n304.  Under the Regulation, insurance exclusions related to gender transition \nare facially invalid. \n305.  Under the Regulation, insurance exclusions related to sterilization are \nfacially invalid. \n68 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-RRE-ARS   Document 1   Filed 11/07/16   Page 69 of 82\n306.  Under the Regulation, insurance exclusions related to abortion services \nare facially invalid.  \n307.  The  Regulation  exposes  the  Plaintiffs  to  the  loss  of  substantial \ngovernment funding as a result of their religious exercise.  \n308.  The Regulation also makes it much more expensive for the Plaintiffs to \ndo  business  with  a  third  party  administrator  for  a  health  benefits  plan.  The \nRegulation subjects third party administrators to potential liability for administering \nreligious health plans like Plaintiffs’, and thus Plaintiffs will be forced to indemnify \nany third party administrator from this liability. This constitutes an additional \nsubstantial burden on its religious exercise.    \n309.  The Regulation exposes the Plaintiffs to substantial penalties under the \nFalse Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. § 3729 et seq.  \n310.  The Regulation exposes the Plaintiffs to criminal penalties under 18 \nU.S.C. § 1035.   \n311.  The Regulation exposes the Plaintiffs to civil suits that would hold them \nliable for practicing their sincerely held religious beliefs.  \n312.  The Regulation thus imposes a substantial burden on the Plaintiffs’ \nreligious exercise.  \n313.  The Regulation furthers no compelling governmental interest.  \n314.  The  Regulation  is  not  the  least  restrictive  means  of  furthering \nDefendants’ stated interests.  \n69 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-RRE-ARS   Document 1   Filed 11/07/16   Page 70 of 82\n315.  The Regulation violates the Plaintiffs rights secured to them by the \nReligious Freedom Restoration Act, 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb et seq.  \nCOUNT XIII \n \nViolation of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution \nFree Exercise Clause \n \n316.  The Plaintiffs incorporate by reference all preceding paragraphs.  \n317.  Plaintiffs object to providing, facilitating, or otherwise participating in \nmedical transition procedures.  \n318.  The Regulation imposes substantial burdens on the Plaintiffs by forcing \nthem to choose between federal funding and their livelihood as healthcare providers \nand their exercise of religion.  \n319.  The Regulation seeks to suppress the religious practice of individuals \nand  organizations  such  as  the  Plaintiffs,  while  allowing  exemptions  for  similar \nconduct based on secular and non-religious reasons. Thus, the Regulation is neither \nneutral nor generally applicable.  \n320.  The Regulation is not justified by a compelling governmental interest.  \n321.  Even if HHS has a compelling government interest, the Regulation is \nnot narrowly tailored to achieve that interest.  \n322.  Defendants’ actions thus violate the Plaintiffs’ rights secured to them by \nthe Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment of the United States Constitution.  \n323.  Absent  injunctive  and  declaratory  relief  against  the  Regulation, \nPlaintiffs have been and will continue to be harmed.  \n70 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-RRE-ARS   Document 1   Filed 11/07/16   Page 71 of 82\nCOUNT XIV \n \nViolation of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution \nDue Process Clause \nSubstantive Due Process \n \n324.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference all preceding paragraphs.  \n325.  The United States has a deeply rooted tradition of honoring physicians’ \nrights to provide medical treatment in accordance with their moral and religious \nbeliefs.  \n326.  Plaintiffs possess a fundamental right of liberty of conscience.  \n327.  Plaintiffs possess  a  fundamental  right  not  to  be  coerced  to  provide \nmedical procedures and services in violation of their conscience.  \n328.  The Regulation coerces Plaintiffs to provide medical procedures and \nservices in violation of their conscience. \n329.  Defendants’ conduct cannot be justified by a compelling governmental \ninterest.  \n330.  The Regulation is not justified by a compelling governmental interest.  \n331.  Even if HHS has a compelling government interest, the Regulation is \nnot narrowly tailored to achieve that interest.  \n332.  Defendants’ actions therefore violate Plaintiffs’ rights to substantive \ndue process.  \n333.  Absent injunctive and declaratory relief against the Regulation, the \nPlaintiffs have been and will continue to be harmed. \n71 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-RRE-ARS   Document 1   Filed 11/07/16   Page 72 of 82\nCOUNT XV \n \nViolation of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution \nDue Process and Equal Protection \n \n334.  The Plaintiffs incorporate by reference all preceding paragraphs.  \n335.  The Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment mandates the equal \ntreatment of all religious faiths and institutions without discrimination or preference.  \n336.  The Regulation discriminates on the basis of religious views or religious \nstatus by refusing to recognize religious exemptions that exist in the law.  \n337.  The Regulation discriminates on the basis of religious views or religious \nstatus  by  refusing  to  recognize  valid  medical  views  of  religious  healthcare \nprofessionals on medical transition procedures.  \n338.  The Defendants’ actions thus violate the Plaintiffs’ rights secured to \nthem by the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution.  \n339.  Absent injunctive and declaratory relief against the Regulation, the \nPlaintiffs have been and will continue to be harmed.  \nCOUNT XVI \n \nViolation of the Clear Notice Standards \nUnder the Spending Clause of Article I of the United States Constitution \n \n340.  The Plaintiffs incorporate by reference all preceding paragraphs.  \n341.  When Congress exercises its Spending Clause power against the States, \nthe United States Supreme Court has held that principles of federalism require \nconditions on Congressional funds given to States must enable a state official to \n“clearly understand,” from the language of the law itself, what conditions the State \n72 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-RRE-ARS   Document 1   Filed 11/07/16   Page 73 of 82\nis agreeing to when accepting the federal funds. Arlington Cent. Sch. Bd. of Educ. v. \nMurphy, 548 U.S. 291, 296 (2006). “The legitimacy of Congress’s exercise of the \nspending power ‘thus rests on whether the [entity] voluntarily and knowingly accepts \nthe terms of the ‘contract.’’” NFIB v. Sebelius, 132 S. Ct. 2566, 2602 (2012) (quoting \nPennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. v. Halderman, 451 U.S. 1, 17 (1981)). Defendants’ ex-\npost Regulation is not in accord with the understanding that existed when the States \nchose to begin accepting Medicare and Medicaid as payment for medical services \nprovided. Bennett v. New Jersey, 470 U.S. 632, 638 (1985) (providing that a state’s \nobligation under cooperative federalism program ‘‘generally should be determined by \nreference to the law in effect when the grants were made’’). \n342.  The text employed by Congress does not support understanding the \nterm “sex” in the manner put forth by Defendants. While Congress has expressed its \nintent to cover “gender identity,” as a protected class, in other pieces of legislation, \nsee, e.g., 18 U.S.C. § 249(a)(2)(A); 42 U.S.C. § 13925(b)(13)(A), it has not done so in \nTitle IX. In other legislation, Congress included “gender identity” along with “sex,” \nthus  evidencing  its  intent  for  “sex”  in  Title  IX  to  retain  its  original  and  only \nmeaning—one’s immutable, biological sex as acknowledged at or before birth. \n343.  The Regulation was passed under the authority Congress delegated to \nHHS in Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act. Section 1557 does not add a new \nnon-discrimination provision to the federal code, but merely incorporates by reference \npre-existing provisions under Title VI, Title IX, the Americans with Disabilities Act, \n73 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-RRE-ARS   Document 1   Filed 11/07/16   Page 74 of 82\nand the Rehabilitation Act. Section 1557 does not independently define terms such \nas “sex.”  \n344.  At the time that the ACA was passed in 2010, no federal courts or \nagencies had interpreted “sex” in Title IX to include gender identity.  \n345.  Title IX also provides that “Nothing in this chapter shall be construed \nto require . . . any person, or public or private entity, to provide or pay for any benefit \nor service, including the use of facilities, related to an abortion.” 20 U.S.C. § 1688. \n346.  Thus, no State could fathom, much less “clearly understand,” that the \nACA would impose on it the conditions created by HHS’s new Regulation—namely, a \nnew  “gender  identity”  requirement,  as  well  as  a  provision  to  require  coverage, \nfunding,  or  facilities  for  abortion.  Accordingly,  the  new  Regulation  violates  the \nSpending Clause. \n347.  Moreover, Defendants are “agencies” under the APA, 5 U.S.C. § 551(1), \nand the new Regulation complained of herein is a “rule” under the APA, id. § 551(4), \nand constitutes “[a]gency action made reviewable by statute and final agency action \nfor which there is no other adequate remedy in a court.” Id. § 704. The APA requires \nthe Court to hold unlawful and set aside any agency action that is “contrary to \nconstitutional  right,  power,  privilege,  or  immunity”  or  “in  excess  of  statutory \njurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right.” Id. § 706(2)(B)–(C). \nThus, the Spending Clause violations articulated herein provide the Court with an \nadditional basis to set aside the new Rule under the APA. \n74 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-RRE-ARS   Document 1   Filed 11/07/16   Page 75 of 82\n348.  The Defendants’ actions thus violate the APA and the Spending Clause \nof the United States Constitution.  \n349.  Absent injunctive and declaratory relief against the Regulation, the \nState Plaintiffs have been and will continue to be harmed. \nCOUNT XVII \nViolation of the Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution \nUnlawful Abrogation of Sovereign Immunity \n \n350.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference all preceding paragraphs.  \n351.  The federal government may not abrogate a state’s sovereign immunity \nunless it makes that intention to abrogate unmistakably clear in the language of the \nstatute and acts pursuant to a valid exercise of its power under § 5 of the Fourteenth \nAmendment. See, e.g., Nevada Dep’t of Human Res. v. Hibbs, 538 U.S. 721, 726, 728 \nn.2 (2003). \n352.  The abrogation referenced herein was not unmistakably clear in the \nlanguage of the relevant statutes, and Defendants did not act pursuant to a valid \nexercise of federal power under § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.   \n353.  In enacting Section 1557 of the ACA, Congress did not make findings \nregarding “gender identity,” but merely incorporated existing law under Title IX, \nwhich does not extend to “gender identity.” Congress has in fact declined to pass \nspecific “gender identity” legislation on numerous occasions.  \n354.  The  Regulation  abrogates  the  sovereign immunity  of  the  States  by \nsubjecting  them  to  lawsuits  from  their  employees.  It  does  so  without  clear \n75 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-RRE-ARS   Document 1   Filed 11/07/16   Page 76 of 82\nauthorization from Congress, and its expansion of the definition of “sex” to include \n“gender identity” is not supported by Congressional findings.  \n355.  The  Regulation  abrogates  the  sovereign immunity  of  the  States  by \nsubjecting them to lawsuits from non-employees, including spouses and dependents \nof its employees, students at health-related schools run by the States, and patients \nat state-run hospitals and medical facilities. It does so without clear authorization \nfrom Congress, and its expansion of the definition of “sex” to include “gender identity” \nis not supported by Congressional findings.  \n356.  Moreover, Defendants are “agencies” under the APA, 5 U.S.C. § 551(1), \nand the new Regulation complained of herein is a “rule” under the APA, id. § 551(4), \nand constitutes “[a]gency action made reviewable by statute and final agency action \nfor which there is no other adequate remedy in a court.” Id. § 704. The APA requires \nthe Court to hold unlawful and set aside any agency action that is “contrary to \nconstitutional  right,  power,  privilege,  or  immunity”  or  “in  excess  of  statutory \njurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right.” Id. § 706(2)(B)-(C). \nThus, the improper abrogation of the States’ sovereign immunity articulated herein \nprovides the Court with an additional basis to set aside the new Rule under the APA. \n357.  The  Defendants’  actions  thus  violate  the  APA  and  the  Eleventh \nAmendment to the United States Constitution.  \n358.  Absent injunctive and declaratory relief against the Regulation, the \nState Plaintiffs have been and will continue to be harmed. \n76 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-RRE-ARS   Document 1   Filed 11/07/16   Page 77 of 82\nCOUNT XVIII \n \nViolation of the Spending Clause of Article I of the United States \nConstitution \nThe Regulation is Unlawful and Unconstitutionally Coercive \n \n359.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference all preceding paragraphs. \n360.  The federal government cannot use its Spending Clause powers to coerce \nthe States, even when proper notice procedures are followed.  \n361.  The Supreme Court struck down a similar attempt under the  ACA \nbecause “such conditions take the form of threats to terminate other significant \nindependent grants,” and are therefore “properly viewed as a means of pressuring the \nStates to accept policy changes.” NFIB, 132 S. Ct. at 2604. \n362.  The Regulation threatens other independent grants, such as general \nMedicare and Medicaid funds, as well as other health-related grants. \n363.  By placing in jeopardy a substantial percentage of the State’s budget if \nit refuses to comply with the Regulation, Defendants have left the State no real choice \nbut to acquiesce in such policy. See NFIB, 132 S. Ct. at 2605 (“The threatened loss of \nover 10 percent of a State’s overall budget, in contrast, is economic dragooning that \nleaves the States with no real option but to acquiesce . . .”). \n364.  Such compulsion is excessive under the Spending Clause, even in the \npresence of clear notice. “Congress may use its spending power to create incentives \nfor [entities] to act in accordance with federal policies. But when ‘pressure turns into \ncompulsion,’ the legislation runs contrary to our system of federalism.” NFIB, 132 S. \nCt. at 2602 (quoting Charles C. Steward Mach. Co. v. Davis, 301 U.S. 548, 590 (1937)) \n77 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-RRE-ARS   Document 1   Filed 11/07/16   Page 78 of 82\n(internal citation omitted). “That is true whether Congress directly commands a State \nto regulate or indirectly coerces a State to adopt a federal regulatory system as its \nown.” Id. \n365.  The compulsion is also improper because the Regulation changes the \nconditions for the receipt of federal funds after the States had already accepted \nCongress’s original conditions. But “[t]he legitimacy of Congress’s exercise of the \nspending power ‘thus rests on whether the [entity] voluntarily and knowingly accepts \nthe terms of the ‘contract.’’” Id. (quoting Pennhurst, 451 U.S. at 17). \n366.  Moreover, Defendants are “agencies” under the APA, 5 U.S.C. § 551(1), \nand the new Regulation complained of herein is a “rule” under the APA, id. § 551(4), \nand constitutes “[a]gency action made reviewable by statute and final agency action \nfor which there is no other adequate remedy in a court.” Id. § 704. The APA requires \nthe Court to hold unlawful and set aside any agency action that is “contrary to \nconstitutional  right,  power,  privilege,  or  immunity”  or  “in  excess  of  statutory \njurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right.” Id. § 706(2)(B)-(C). \nThus, the Spending Clause violations articulated herein provide the Court with an \nadditional basis to set aside the new Rule under the APA. \n367.  The Defendants’ actions thus violate the APA and the Spending Clause \nof the United States Constitution.  \n368.  Absent injunctive and declaratory relief against the Regulation, the \nPlaintiffs have been and will continue to be harmed. \n78 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-RRE-ARS   Document 1   Filed 11/07/16   Page 79 of 82\nCOUNT XIX \nViolation of Article I and the Tenth Amendment  \nof the United States Constitution \nThe Regulation Unlawfully Commandeers the States \n369.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference all preceding paragraphs.  \n370.  The Tenth Amendment restrains the power of Congress by reserving \npowers for the states that are not delegated to Congress in Article I.  \n371.  With  the  Regulation,  Defendants  have  “commandeer[ed]  a  State’s \nlegislative or administrative apparatus for federal purposes.” NFIB, 132 S. Ct. at \n2602. \n372.  Such  commandeering  exceeds  powers  delegated  to  Congress  under \nArticle I and invades the powers reserved to the States in the Tenth Amendment. \n373.  The  Defendants’  actions  thus  violate  Article  I  and  the  Tenth \nAmendment of the United States Constitution.  \n374.  Absent injunctive and declaratory relief against the Regulation, the \nPlaintiffs have been and will continue to be harmed. \nCOUNT XX \nViolation of the Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution \nUnconstitutional Exercise of Federal Power \n375.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference all preceding paragraphs. \n376.  State Plaintiff cannot afford the exorbitant and unfunded costs of the \nRegulation, but has no choice other than to participate.  \n79 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-RRE-ARS   Document 1   Filed 11/07/16   Page 80 of 82\n377.  By effectively co-opting the State’s control over its budgetary processes \nand legislative agendas through compelling it to assume costs it cannot afford, the \nnew Rule invades its sovereign sphere. \n378.  The new Rule violates the Tenth Amendment of the Constitution of the \nUnited  States,  and  runs  afoul  of  the  Constitution’s  principle  of  federalism,  by \ncommandeering the State and its employees as agents of the federal government’s \nregulatory scheme at the State’s own cost.  \n379.  The Defendants’ actions thus violate the Tenth Amendment to the \nUnited States Constitution.  \n380.  Absent injunctive and declaratory relief against the Regulation, the \nPlaintiffs have been and will continue to be harmed. \nV. PRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWherefore, Plaintiffs pray the Court:  \na.

NATURE OF THE ACTION \n1.  In May 2016, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”), in \ncoordination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”), published a final \nrule interpreting Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act (“ACA”). Section 1557 prohibits \ndiscrimination on the basis of sex in federally funded health programs and activities. See 42 \nU.S.C. § 18116. HHS’s rule, the “2016 Rule,” radically expands this prohibition into a mandate \nthat coerces Catholic hospitals and other healthcare providers to perform, support, and cover \ngender-transition and abortion procedures. HHS also said that it would coordinate with the \nEEOC to enforce a similar coverage requirement against employers and their health plans \npursuant to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, thus extending the mandate to hundreds of \nthousands of employers across the country, even those not involved in healthcare. \n2.  In 2019, a federal district court found that the 2016 Rule violated the Religious \nFreedom Restoration Act and the Administrative Procedure Act, vacated portions of the rule, and \nordered HHS to reconsider. In June 2020, HHS published a new final rule, the “2020 Rule,” that \nwould have repealed much of the 2016 Rule, including its most problematic provisions. But the \nnew rule never became operative. Two district courts enjoined it and ordered that the 2016 Rule \nremain in effect. \n3.  In this Second Amended Complaint, Plaintiffs refer to the requirements imposed \nby the 2016 Rule collectively as the “Mandate.” Plaintiffs will refer separately to the 2016 Rule \nand the 2020 Rule when context or clarity requires. \n4 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 97   Filed 11/23/20   Page 5 of 86\n4.  The 2016 Rule applies directly to a “covered entity,” i.e., an entity that operates a \nfederally funded health program or activity. This encompasses virtually all healthcare providers \nand health insurers in the United States. And because the rule affects nearly every insurer, it also \naffects Catholic employers that are not “covered entities.” As a result of the rule, some members \nof Plaintiff The Catholic Benefits Association received notice from their insurers that their health \nplans had begun covering gender-transition services, including “[m]ale to female surgeries,” \n“female to male surgeries,” and “cross-sex hormone therapy.” \n5.  Catholic employers cannot avoid the Mandate by adopting a self-insured health \nplan and working with a third party administrator (“TPA”) to administer benefits, because the \n2016 Rule also subjects TPAs to its requirements. Catholic employers that have excluded \ngender-transition and abortion services from their self-insured health plans have been required to \nindemnify their TPAs, or otherwise accept their TPAs’ liability, for violating the 2016 Rule. \n6.  HHS could have included both a religious exemption and an abortion exemption \nin its 2016 Rule. There was ample reason to do so. Section 1557 prohibits sex discrimination by \nincorporating Title IX, and Title IX expressly provides that it “shall not apply” to religious \norganizations, 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a)(3), and “shall [not] be construed to require . . . any person . . . \nto provide or pay for any benefit or service . . . related to an abortion,” id. § 1688. Numerous \nother federal laws, including the ACA itself, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, and the \nFirst Amendment, likewise protect rights of conscience and religious exercise. But HHS ignored \nall of this, imposed its Mandate to maximal effect, and forced a needless confrontation with \nhealthcare providers and employers like Plaintiffs and their members, whose religious \nconvictions prohibit them from facilitating gender transitions and abortions. \n5 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 97   Filed 11/23/20   Page 6 of 86\n7.  Failure to comply with the Mandate exposes Catholic entities to severe penalties. \nCovered entities can be fined, barred from Medicaid and Medicare funding, and subjected to \ntreble damages under the False Claims Act. Responsible persons may face prison time. Because \nthe EEOC similarly interprets Title VII to require employer health plans to cover gender-\ntransition services, employers – even employers that are not covered entities under the 2016 Rule \n– may face civil lawsuits and agency enforcement actions that expose them to compensatory \ndamages, punitive damages, and attorneys fees. \n8.  Plaintiffs seek a declaration that the Mandate cannot lawfully be applied to them \nor to any of their members, and they seek an injunction barring enforcement of the Mandate \nagainst them, their members, and any third parties acting in concert with them for the delivery of \nhealth coverage and services, including insurers and TPAs. \nII.  JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n9.  The Court has subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1361 \nbecause this action arises under the Constitution and laws of the United States. The Court has \njurisdiction to render declaratory and injunctive relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 and 2202, \nand 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb-1. \n10.  Venue lies in this district under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)(1). Plaintiffs Diocese of \nFargo and Catholic Charities North Dakota reside in this district and this division because their \nprincipal places of business are here. \nIII.  PARTIES \nA.  Plaintiffs \n1.  Diocese of Fargo \n11.  The Diocese of Fargo is that “portion of the people of God,” located in 30 \ncounties in eastern North Dakota, “which is entrusted to [the Bishop of Fargo] for him to \n6 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 97   Filed 11/23/20   Page 7 of 86\nshepherd” in cooperation with his priests. See Code of Canon Law, c. 369 (1983). The Diocese \ncarries out the spiritual, educational, and social service mission of the Catholic Church in eastern \nNorth Dakota. Its Bishop is the Most Reverend John Thomas Folda. He exercises pastoral care \nand canonical support for more than 130 parishes and missions and other Catholic ministries \nwithin the Diocese. \n12.  The Diocese of Fargo is a member of The Catholic Benefits Association. \n13.  The Diocese of Fargo comprises 35,786 square miles and, through its parishes and \nother Catholic organizations, ministers to more than 71,000 Catholics and thousands of others in \neastern North Dakota.  \n14.  The Diocese of Fargo has 15 or more employees and is an “employer” within the \nmeaning of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. 42 U.S.C. § 2000e(b). \n15.  The educational mission of the Diocese of Fargo is carried out, in part, through 12 \nelementary schools, one middle school, and one high school within the Diocese. The five \ndiocesan schools in the Fargo metro area (three elementary schools, the middle school, and the \nhigh school) belong to the St. John Paul II Catholic Schools Network. \n16.  The charitable mission of the Diocese of Fargo is carried out through local \nparishes and various ministries founded by or otherwise related to the Diocese, including \nCatholic Charities North Dakota. \n17.  The Diocese of Fargo has a Respect Life Office whose mission is to foster a \nculture of life and to proclaim and defend the God-given, inviolable dignity of every person. The \nRespect Life Office runs Project Rachel, a post-abortion ministry that offers hope and healing for \nthose who suffer from the spiritual and emotional pain of abortion and its aftermath. \n7 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 97   Filed 11/23/20   Page 8 of 86\n18.  Another ministry of the Diocese of Fargo is the North Dakota Catholic \nConference, which acts on behalf of the Catholic bishops of North Dakota to respond to public \npolicy issues of concern to the Catholic Church and to educate Catholics and the general public \nabout Catholic social doctrine. Inspired by Scripture and Catholic teachings, the Conference \nworks at the appropriate level of government for legislation and regulations that reflect the \nGospel message of respect for human life, care for the poor, and promotion of the common good. \nThe Conference advocates across a broad spectrum of issues, including alternatives to abortion, \nsupport for children and families, healthcare, religious liberty, economic justice, and care for the \nenvironment. \n19.  The Diocese of Fargo operates a self-insured health plan. That is, the Diocese \ndoes not contract with a separate insurance company for its primary health coverage. Rather, the \nDiocese itself underwrites the medical costs of plan participants. It rents a provider network and \nhas engaged a TPA to administer its plan, Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Dakota \n(“BCBSND”).  \n20.  BCBSND is a covered entity under the 2016 Rule. \n21.  Consistent with Catholic values and teaching, the Diocese of Fargo’s health plan \ncategorically excludes gender transition and abortion procedures.  \n22.  Because of the 2016 Rule, BCBSND required the Diocese of Fargo to enter into a \n“PPACA Section 1557 Nondiscrimination Addendum.” The Addendum recites that “Section \n1557 applies to [BCBSND’s] operations as a third-party administrator.” Under the Addendum, \nDiocese of Fargo accepts “any and all liability” for decisions related to plan design, including the \nexclusion of gender transition and abortion coverage, and absolves BCBSND of any fiduciary \n8 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 97   Filed 11/23/20   Page 9 of 86\nresponsibility related to “any plan design or administration that may be determined to violate \nSection 1557.” \n23.  Many of the Catholic parishes and affiliated Catholic ministries within Diocese of \nFargo participate in the diocesan health plan.  \n2.  Catholic Charities North Dakota \n24.  Catholic Charities North Dakota (“Catholic Charities”) serves the poor, elderly, \nand disabled throughout North Dakota through critical social services programs. Its mission is to \nserve people in need, regardless of religious affiliation, based on the fundamental principles of \nCatholic Social Teaching. The services of Catholic Charities include disaster relief, individual \nand family counseling, adoption services, pregnancy counseling, and guardianship services for \nadults with special needs. \n25.  Catholic Charities is a member of The Catholic Benefits Association. \n26.  Catholic Charities has 15 or more employees and is an “employer” within the \nmeaning of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. 42 U.S.C. § 2000e(b). \n27.  Catholic Charities adheres to Catholic teachings, including those regarding \nsanctity of human life and care for one’s neighbors. Catholic Charities operates Adults Adopting \nSpecial Kids (“AASK”), which provides adoption services to children in foster care and the \nfamilies who adopt them. Through its pregnancy and parental counseling program, Catholic \nCharities counsels mothers and fathers on parenting, adoption, and marriage, and connects them \nwith community resources. In its disaster relief program, Catholic Charities provides emergency \nrelief and recovery services for victims of blizzards, floods, tornadoes, droughts, and wildfires, \noffering direct financial aid and other assistance. Finally, through its guardianship programs, \nCatholic Charities offers guardianship services to vulnerable adults and persons with intellectual \n9 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 97   Filed 11/23/20   Page 10 of 86\ndisabilities, providing support and direction for individuals who face difficulties in daily living \nand decisionmaking. \n28.  Catholic Charities contracts with a group health insurance company for the \nbenefit of its employees and their families.  \n29.  Upon information and belief, Catholic Charities’ insurer is a covered entity under \nthe 2016 Rule. \n3.  Catholic Medical Association \n30.  The Catholic Medical Association (“CMA”) is a national, physician-led \ncommunity of healthcare professionals. Its mission is to inform, organize, and inspire its \nmembers, in steadfast fidelity to the teachings of the Catholic Church, to uphold the principles of \nthe Catholic faith in the science and practice of medicine. \n31.  The CMA’s mission includes defending its members’ right to follow their \nconscience and Catholic teaching in their professional work. It also serves as a national advocate \nfor the views of Catholic physicians and healthcare professionals. \n32.  The CMA is a member of The Catholic Benefits Association. \n33.  To be a member of the CMA, a Catholic physician must solemnly promise to:  \n•  Practice Catholic moral principles, in particular those related to bio-medical ethics;  \n•  Be faithful to the teachings of Catholic Church and to form one’s professional \nconscience in accord with them;  \n•  Refuse to become an instrument of violent or oppressive applications of medicine;   \n•  Respect one’s patients and treat them without prejudice arising from religion, racial, \nethnic, socio-economic or sexual differences; and \n•  Work with openness toward every person, independently of their religious beliefs. \n \n34.  CMA members include Catholic physicians who practice in a number of medical \nspecialties, including endocrinology, ob-gyn, psychiatry, dermatology, urology, internal \n10 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 97   Filed 11/23/20   Page 11 of 86\nmedicine, pediatrics, family practice, and plastic surgery. While CMA members in these \nspecialties do not provide gender transition services, they do provide medical services and \nperform medical procedures that are performed by other physicians as part of a gender transition.   \n35.  CMA members include licensed physicians who are covered entities under the \n2016 Rule.  \n36.  These CMA members will be impacted by the Mandate because the Mandate (1) \ncompels them to speak differently to their patients with regard to gender transition procedures, \n(2) prohibits them from conveying to patients their own medical judgment with regard to gender \ntransition services, and (3) forces them to offer services or facilities in furtherance of gender \ntransitions.  \n37.  The CMA has members who provide healthcare coverage for employees, \ncoverage that excludes gender transition services and surgeries. Those members will be impacted \nby the Mandate. \n38.  The CMA has members who have treated or currently treat patients with gender \ndysphoria, and who may be liable for failure to provide or refer their patients for gender \ntransition services or surgeries.  \n39.  The CMA has standing to represent all of its present and future members.  \n40.  The Mandate harms the CMA’s members.  \n41.  The CMA seeks to protect its members’ ability to practice medicine in accordance \nwith Catholic values and to avoid providing medical services that are contrary to Catholic values. \n42.  The CMA can adequately represent its members’ interests.  \n43.  [Intentionally omitted]. \n11 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 97   Filed 11/23/20   Page 12 of 86\n4.  The Catholic Benefits Association \n44.  The CBA is a § 501(c)(3) nonprofit corporation and Catholic ministry. Its articles \nof incorporation state that it is “organized for charitable purposes” that are “consistent with \nCatholic values, doctrine, and canon law.” Specifically, they state that the CBA is organized \n“[t]o support Catholic employers . . . that, as part of their religious witness and exercise, provide \nhealth or other benefits to their respective employees in a manner that is consistent with Catholic \nvalues”; “[t]o work and advocate for religious freedom of Catholic and other employers seeking \nto conduct their ministries and businesses according to their religious values”; “[t]o make \ncharitable donations to Catholic ministries”; and “[t]o incorporate . . . one or more Catholic \ninsurance companies, in furtherance of the Ministry’s purposes.” See Ex. A, Amended and \nRestated Certificate of Incorporation of the Catholic Benefits Association (“CBA Articles”), art. \nIV. \n45.  The Most Reverend William E. Lori, Archbishop of Baltimore, is chairman of the \nCBA’s board of directors. \n46.  Eight of CBA’s directors are Catholic bishops.  They are Most Rev. Gregory M. \nAymond of New Orleans, Most Rev. Paul S. Coakley of Oklahoma City, Most Rev. Salvatore \nCordileone of San Francisco, Most Rev. John T. Folda of Fargo, Most Rev. Bernard A. Hebda of \nSaint Paul and Minneapolis, Most Rev. William E. Lori of Baltimore, Most Rev. Joseph F. \nNaumann of Kansas City in Kansas, and Most Rev. Thomas G. Wenski of Miami.  Two of its \ndirectors are religious women, Mother Agnes Mary Donovan of Sisters of Life, and Sister Mary \nPeter Muehlenkamp of the Dominican Sisters of Saint Cecilia.  Five of its directors are Catholic \nlay persons, including: Helen Alvare, Beth Elfrey, Ed Hanway, Carla Mills, and Doug Wilson. \n47.  All of the CBA’s officers are Catholic. \n12 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 97   Filed 11/23/20   Page 13 of 86\n48.  The CBA has a standing Ethics Committee, comprised exclusively of the \narchbishops on its board. The CBA’s bylaws state: \nThe  Ethics  Committee  shall  have  exclusive  authority  to  review  all  benefits, \nproducts, and services provided by the Ministry, its affiliates or subsidiaries, or \ntheir respective contractors to ensure such conform with Catholic values and \ndoctrine. If they do not, the committee shall determine the necessary corrections to \nbring such benefits, products, and services into conformity with Catholic values \nand doctrine. The decision of the committee shall be final and binding on the \nMinistry, its board, and its officers . . . . \nEx. B, CBA Bylaws, art. 5.14.2. \n49.  To be a member of the CBA, an organization must meet these criteria, among \nothers: (1) it shall be a Catholic employer, and (2) with regard to the benefits it provides to its \nemployees, independent contractors, or students, or with regard to the health care services it \nprovides to its patients, the employer shall, as part of its religious witness and exercise, be \ncommitted to providing no benefits or services inconsistent with Catholic values. Ex. B, CBA \nBylaws art. 3.1.2; see also Ex. A, CBA Articles, art. VI, Members; Ex. C, CBA Nonprofit \nEmployer Application for Membership; Ex. D, CBA For Profit Employer Application for \nMembership. \n50.  The Bylaws of the CBA provide that an employer “shall satisfy the requirement \nof being Catholic if either the employer is listed in the current edition of The Official Catholic \nDirectory or the secretary or his or her designee makes such a determination.” Ex. B, CBA \nBylaws, art. § 3.1.1.1. \n51.  The Bylaws further provide that a for-profit employer seeking membership in the \nCBA “shall be deemed Catholic only if (i) Catholics (or trusts or other entities wholly controlled \nby such Catholic individuals) own 51% or more of employer, (ii) 51% or more of the members \nof the employer’s governing body, if any, is comprised of Catholics, and (iii) either the \nemployer’s owners or governing body has adopted a written policy stating that the employer is \n13 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 97   Filed 11/23/20   Page 14 of 86\ncommitted to providing no benefits to the employer’s employees or independent contractors \ninconsistent with Catholic values.” Ex. B, CBA Bylaws, art. § 3.1.1.2. \n52.  All members of the CBA meet its criteria for being Catholic. \n53.  The CBA presently has over 1,030 employer members plus over 5,100 member \nCatholic parishes, covering more than 90,000 employees and their families. \n54.  CBA members include over 60 Catholic dioceses and archdioceses. CBA \nmembers also include hospitals, Catholic Charities, mental health service providers, counseling \ncenters, nursing homes, senior residence facilities, schools, colleges, religious orders, and other \nCatholic ministries and Catholic-owned businesses.  \n55.  CBA members include hospitals and other healthcare entities that receive \nMedicaid and Medicare payments and thus are covered entities under the 2016 Rule. \n56.  CBA members include Catholic Charities and other social service organizations \nthat offer counseling and other mental health services, in individual and group settings, that \nreceive Medicaid and Medicare payments and participate in HHS-funded programs and thus are \ncovered entities under the 2016 Rule.  \n57.  CBA members include employers, including Catholic dioceses and archdioceses, \nthat provide employee health benefits in conjunction with health insurers and TPAs. These \ninsurers and TPAs participate in federally funded marketplaces and thus are covered entities \nunder the 2016 Rule. The 2016 Rule thus constrains CBA members’ ability to arrange for and \nsecure health plans that reflect their Catholic values. \n58.  CBA members include employers that are covered entities and those that are not \ncovered entities under the 2016 Rule.  \n14 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 97   Filed 11/23/20   Page 15 of 86\n59.  CBA members include employers with 15 or more employees who are \n“employers” within the meaning of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. 42 U.S.C. § \n2000e(b). \n60.  The CBA has standing to represent all of its present and future members.  \n61.  The Mandate harms the CBA’s members.  \n62.  The CBA seeks to protect its members’ ability to operate in accordance with \nCatholic values and to access morally compliant health coverage for their respective employees \nor agents. It additionally seeks, for members that are covered entities, protection from being \nrequired to provide medical services and to perform surgeries contrary to Catholic values. \n63.  The CBA can adequately represent its members’ interests. All members are \nsimilarly situated in that the Defendants’ Mandate coerces CBA members to cover, provide, pay \nfor, or otherwise directly or indirectly facilitate access to gender transition services and abortions \nfor their patients or for their employees in violation of members’ sincerely held Catholic beliefs. \nThe Mandate also deprives or will deprive certain CBA members of the option to purchase group \ninsurance without gender transition and abortion coverage.  \n64.  The CBA brings this action on behalf itself and on behalf of specific members \nwho themselves have suffered and will suffer concrete harm as a result of Defendants’ actions. \nB.  Defendants \n65.  Defendants are appointed officials of the federal government and federal \ngovernment agencies responsible for promulgating, administering, and enforcing the Mandate. \n66.  Defendant United States Department of Health and Human Services is an \nexecutive agency of the United States government and is responsible for the promulgation, \nadministration, and enforcement of the 2016 Rule.  \n15 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 97   Filed 11/23/20   Page 16 of 86\n67.  Defendant Alex M. Azar II is the Secretary of HHS. He is sued only in his official \ncapacity. \n68.  Defendant Equal Employment Opportunity Commission is a federal agency that \nadministers, interprets, and enforces certain laws, including Title VII. The EEOC is responsible \nfor, among other things, investigating complaints and bringing enforcement actions against \nemployers for discrimination “because of . . . sex” in violation of Title VII. \n69.  Defendant Janet Dhillon is the EEOC Chair. She is, in this capacity, responsible \nfor the administration and implementation of policy within the EEOC, including investigation \nand enforcement pursuant to Title VII. She is sued only in her official capacity. \nIV.  PLAINTIFFS’ BELIEFS AND PRACTICES RELATED TO THE MANDATE \n70.  All Plaintiffs and all CBA members are Catholic ministries or Catholic-owned \nbusinesses that believe and practice the teachings of the Catholic Church on the nature of the \nhuman person, the dignity of humankind, the right to life, the right of conscience and religious \nfreedom, and related ethical issues. \nA.  Catholic teaching on the duty to treat all persons with dignity \n71.  The Catholic Church teaches that all people are born in the image and likeness of \nGod and are thus imbued with human dignity. Catechism of the Catholic Church (“CCC”) 1701. \nAs such, all persons and are to be loved and respected in their human freedom, CCC 1738, even \nif they reject the Church’s teaching on matters of sexual identity and sexual morality, CCC 2358.  \n72.  The United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (“USCCB”) has applied this \nteaching to transgender persons and those afflicted with gender dysphoria. In response to the \nU.S. Department of Education’s guidance letter asserting that Title IX bars discrimination based \non “gender identity,” the USCCB stressed that the Catholic Church “consistently affirms the \ninherent dignity of each and every human person and advocates for the wellbeing of all people, \n16 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 97   Filed 11/23/20   Page 17 of 86\nparticularly the most vulnerable.” The USCCB statement affirms that people who struggle with \ntheir gender identity “deserve compassion, sensitivity, and respect.”1  \n73.   The comments the USCCB filed along with other Christian bodies in response to \nHHS’s proposed rule under Section 1557 likewise affirmed that “[e]veryone should have access \nto health care and health coverage.”2 \n74.  HHS has acknowledged that every religious group that submitted comments in \nresponse to its propose rule shared similar sentiments. Its 2016 Rule notes, “None of the \ncommenters supporting a religious exemption asserted that there would be a religious basis for \ngenerally refusing to treat LGBT individuals for a medical condition.” 81 Fed. Reg. 31,376, \n31,379 (May 18, 2016). \nB.  Catholic teaching on gender identity \n75.  Catholic teaching on the nature of the human person begins with the Book of \nGenesis, which teaches that “God created man in his own image . . . male and female he created \nthem.” CCC 2331 (quoting Genesis 1:27).  \n76.  The Catechism further teaches that “[e]veryone, man and woman, should \nacknowledge and accept his sexual identity.” CCC 2333. “By creating the human being man and \nwoman, God gives personal dignity equally to the one and the other. Each of them, man and \nwoman, should acknowledge and accept his sexual identity.” CCC 2393. \n \n1 USCCB, USCCB Chairmen Respond to Administration’s New Guidance Letter on Title IX \nApplication, May 16, 2016, https://www.usccb.org/news/2016/usccb-chairmen-respond-\nadministrations-new-guidance-letter-title-ix-application.   \n2 Comments from USCCB et al. to U.S. Dept. of Health and Human Services Re: \nNondiscrimination in Health Programs and Activities RIN 0945-AA-2 (Nov. 6, 2015), \nhttp://www.usccb.org/about/general-counsel/rulemaking/upload/Comments-Proposal-HHS-Reg-\nNondiscrimination-Federally-Funded-Health.pdf. \n17 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 97   Filed 11/23/20   Page 18 of 86\n77.  Pope Francis has reiterated this Catholic teaching in recent years, affirming that \n“man too has a nature that he must respect and that he cannot manipulate at will. . . . The \nacceptance of our bodies as God’s gift is vital for welcoming and accepting the whole world as a \ngift from the Father. . . . Learning to accept our body, to care for it and to respect its fullest \nmeaning, is an essential element of any genuine human ecology.” Laudato Si, No. 155 (2015).  \n78.  As for youth who are struggling with their gender identity, Pope Francis has \ntaught that “the young need to be helped to accept their own body as it was created.” Amoris \nLaetitia, No. 285 (2016).  \n79.  Sexual reassignment surgery requires the destruction of healthy sexual and \nreproductive organs.3  \n80.  The Catholic Church teaches that intentionally removing healthy organs that \nidentify as a person as male or female is a type of amputation or mutilation that is intrinsically \nevil. \n81.  Some gender transition surgeries also involve sterilization. The Catholic Church \nteaches that all forms of sterilization are contrary to the moral law. CCC 2370.  \n82.   The Catholic Church teaches that “[e]xcept when performed for strictly \ntherapeutic medical reasons, directly intended amputations, mutilations, and sterilizations \nperformed on innocent persons are against the moral law.” CCC 2297.  \nC.  Catholic teaching on abortion \n83.  The Catechism of the Catholic Church teaches that life begins at conception and \nthat “[h]uman life must be respected and protected absolutely from the moment of conception.” \n \n3 Richard P. Fitzgibbons, M.D., et al., The Psychopathology of “Sex Reassignment” Surgery: \nAssessing its Medical, Psychological and Ethical Appropriateness, Nat’l Catholic Bioethics Q. \n97, 100 (Spring 2009), https://repository.library.georgetown.edu/handle/10822/1029434.  \n18 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 97   Filed 11/23/20   Page 19 of 86\nCCC 2270. Thus, “[d]irect abortion, that is to say, abortion willed either as an end or a means, is \ngravely contrary to the moral law.” CCC 2271.  \nD.  Catholic teaching on scandal \n84.  Catholic moral theology prohibits acts that may give rise to “scandal.” The \nCatechism defines scandal as “an attitude or behavior which leads another to do evil.” CCC \n2284. The Catechism teaches that “[a]nyone who uses the power at his disposal in such a way \nthat it leads others to do wrong becomes guilty of scandal and responsible for the evil that he has \ndirectly or indirectly encouraged.” CCC 2287. Avoiding scandal is particularly important for \nCatholic entities that seek to inculcate Catholic faith and values. \nE.  The Ethical and Religious Directives \n85.  The foregoing teachings are reflected in the Ethical and Religious Directives for \nCatholic Health Care Services (“Ethical and Religious Directives” or “ERDs”), a document \nissued by the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops in order “to reaffirm the ethical \nstandards of behavior in health care that flow from the Church’s teaching about the dignity of the \nhuman person” and “to provide authoritative guidance on certain moral issues that face Catholic \nhealth care today.” USCCB, Ethical and Religious Directives for Catholic Health Care Services, \nFifth Edition, ¶ 4, http://www.usccb.org/issues-and-action/human-life-and-dignity/health-\ncare/upload/Ethical-Religious-Directives-Catholic-Health-Care-Services-fifth-edition-2009.pdf .  \n86.  The ERDs teach that “[d]irect sterilization of either men or women, whether \npermanent or temporary, is not permitted in a Catholic health care institution. Procedures that \ninduce sterility are permitted when their direct effect is the cure or alleviation of a present and \nserious pathology and a simpler treatment is not available.” Id. ¶ 53. \n19 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 97   Filed 11/23/20   Page 20 of 86\n87.  The ERDs teach that “Catholic health care organizations are not permitted to \nengage in immediate material cooperation in actions that are intrinsically immoral, such as \nabortion, euthanasia, assisted suicide, and direct sterilization.” Id. ¶ 70. \nF.  The Catholic Benefits Association’s Ethics Committee \n88.  As noted above, the CBA’s Ethics Committee, comprised exclusively of Catholic \narchbishops, has the duty and responsibility to define Catholic values and doctrine on relevant \nissues for CBA members.  \n89.  In November 2016, the CBA’s Ethics Committee convened to address doctrinal \nand ethical issues related to the Mandate. After consultation, it unanimously adopted the \nfollowing resolutions:  \na.  RESOLVED: that treatments and services designed to alter a person’s biological \nsex are contrary to Catholic values. A Catholic employer, therefore, cannot, \nconsistent with Catholic values, comply with the government’s mandate to \ninclude coverage in its employee health plan for treatments services designed to \nalter a person’s biological sex. \nb.  RESOLVED: that treatments and services designed to alter a person’s biological \nsex are contrary to Catholic values. A Catholic hospital, clinic, physicians practice \ngroup, or other medical provider, therefore, cannot, consistent with Catholic \nvalues, comply with the government’s mandate to provide or deliver treatments or \nservices designed to alter a person’s biological sex. \nc.  RESOLVED: that abortion is contrary to Catholic values. A Catholic employer, \ntherefore, cannot, consistent with Catholic values, comply with any government \nmandate to include coverage in its employee health plan for abortion. \nd.  RESOLVED: that abortion is contrary to Catholic values. A Catholic health care \ninsurer or third party administrator, therefore, cannot, consistent with Catholic \nvalues, comply with any government abortion mandate by operating or \nadministering a plan that provides coverage for abortion. \ne.  RESOLVED: that abortion is contrary to Catholic values. A Catholic hospital, \nclinic, physicians practice group, or other medical provider, therefore, cannot, \nconsistent with Catholic values, comply with any government abortion mandate \nthat requires the provision and delivery of abortion services. \n20 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 97   Filed 11/23/20   Page 21 of 86\n90.  Consistent with the Ethics Committee’s guidance, Plaintiffs and all CBA \nmembers believe they must adhere to the above teachings as matters of religious faith and \ndoctrine. Consequently, CBA members believe that gender transition procedures, sterilization, \nand abortion are contrary to the Catholic faith. CBA members further believe, as part of their \nfaith, that they must not provide, pay for, or directly or indirectly facilitate access to such \nservices and, therefore, that they must not perform gender transition services or abortions and \nmust not include coverage for such procedures in their group health plans. \nG.  The Mandate constitutes bad medicine \n91.  In addition to the religious and ethical convictions described above, Plaintiffs and \nall CBA members also believe that the Mandate constitutes bad medicine.  \n92.  Because Defendants’ Mandate has no age limit, it requires covered entities to \nprovide gender transition services for adolescents diagnosed with gender dysphoria.  \n93.  Placing adolescents on puberty blockers or cross-sex hormones may cause \npermanent infertility and increased health risks.  \n94.  For example, male adolescents on cross-sex hormones are at a higher risk for \nthrombosis, cardiovascular disease, weight gain, elevated blood pressure, decreased glucose \ntolerance, gallbladder disease, and breast cancer.  \n95.  Similarly, female adolescents on cross-sex hormones are at a higher risk for \nhepatotoxicity, polycythemia, increased risk of sleep apnea, insulin resistance, and unknown \neffects on breast, endometrial, and ovarian tissues.  \n96.  These consequences are even more serious given that the overwhelming majority \nof adolescents who are formally diagnosed with gender dysphoria naturally come to accept their \nsex and enjoy emotional health by late adolescence.  \n21 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 97   Filed 11/23/20   Page 22 of 86\n97.  Even where gender transition surgeries are effective in helping patients’ physical \nbodies match their gender identity, post-surgical individuals have substantially higher rates of \noverall mortality, death from cardiovascular disease and suicide, suicide attempts, and \nhospitalizations compared to a healthy control population, especially as the years progress.  \n98.  Plaintiffs believe that Defendants’ Mandate also declares as “medically \nnecessary” a radical course of treatment that the medical profession properly rejects when it \ncomes to other psychological conditions where people experience emotional distress because of a \ndiscrepancy between their self-image and the physical reality. According to Defendants’ logic, it \nwould be “medically necessary” to perform liposuction on someone with anorexia nervosa \n(belief that one is obese), cosmetic surgery on someone with body dysmorphic disorder (belief \nthat one is disfigured), or amputations for someone with body integrity identity disorder (belief \nthat one is meant to be disabled).  \n99.  Plaintiffs also believe that optimal patient care—including patient education, \ndiagnosis, and treatment—requires taking account of the biological differences between men and \nwomen. To cite but one example, optimal prevention of and treatment for heart disease in \nwomen requires monitoring for different warning signs, accounting for different risk factors, and \nproviding different counseling than it would for men.  \n100.  For all these reasons, the CBA and its members believe that providing gender \ntransition services is contrary to their religious and professional obligations and constitutes bad \nmedicine. \nV.  THE MANDATE \nA.  Statutory Overview \n1.  Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act and its incorporation of Title \nIX of the Education Amendments of 1972 \n22 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 97   Filed 11/23/20   Page 23 of 86\n101.  Together, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Pub. L. 111-148, 124 \nStat. 119 (Mar. 23, 2010), and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, Pub. \nL. 111-152, 124 Stat. 1029 (Mar. 30, 2010), make up and are known as the Affordable Care Act. \n102.  Section 1557(a) of the ACA prohibits discrimination in federally funded \nhealthcare programs and activities on the basis of (1) race, color, and national origin, (2) sex, (3) \nage, and (4) disability. See 42 U.S.C. § 18116(a). The statute does not do this directly. Instead, it \nincorporates by reference, and bars discrimination “on the ground prohibited by,” four other \nfederal laws: (1) Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000d et seq.), (2) Title IX \nof the Education Amendments of 1972 (20 U.S.C. 1681 et seq.); (3) the Age Discrimination Act \nof 1975 (42 U.S.C. 6101 et seq.); and (4) section 794 of Title 29 (the Rehabilitation Act). \n103.  Section 1557(b) of the ACA provides that nothing in the statute “shall be \nconstrued to invalidate or limit the rights, remedies, procedures, or legal standards available to \nindividuals aggrieved under title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000d et seq.), \ntitle VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000e et seq.), title IX of the Education \nAmendments of 1972 (20 U.S.C. 1681 et seq.), section 794 of Title 29, or the Age \nDiscrimination Act of 1975.” 42 U.S.C. § 18116(b). \n104.  Title IX was enacted in 1972. Public Law No. 92-318, 86 Stat. 235 (June 23, \n1972). It states that no person “shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participating in, be \ndenied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity \nreceiving Federal financial assistance.” 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a).  \n105.  Title IX’s prohibition, however, “shall not apply” to an institution “controlled by \na religious organization if the application of this subsection would not be consistent with the \nreligious tenets of such organization.” 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a)(3).  \n23 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 97   Filed 11/23/20   Page 24 of 86\n106.  Title IX also says that “[n]othing in this chapter shall be construed to require or \nprohibit any person, or public or private entity, to provide or pay for any benefit or service, \nincluding the use of facilities, related to an abortion.” 20 U.S.C. § 1688.  \n107.  The ordinary public meaning of Title IX, and thus Section 1557, is that religious \norganizations like Plaintiffs are not subject to its requirements, nor can the statute be construed to \nrequire Plaintiffs to provide or pay for abortions. \n2.  Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 \n108.  Congress enacted Title VII in 1964. Public Law 88-352, 78 Stat. 241 (July 2, \n1964). \n109.  Title VII makes it unlawful for an employer to discriminate against an employee \nor prospective employee “because of such individual’s . . . sex.” 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2. \n110.  Title VII defines an “employer” subject to its provisions as “a person engaged in \nan industry affecting commerce who has fifteen or more employees for each working day in each \nof twenty or more calendar weeks in the current or preceding calendar year.” 42 U.S.C. § \n2000e(b). \n111.  The U.S. Census Bureau estimates that there are over 875,000 employers in the \nUnited States with 15 or more employees.4 \n112.  Title VII contains an exemption for religious employers. It states that Title VII \n“shall not apply” to a religious organization’s “employment of individuals of a particular \n \n4 See U.S. Census Bureau, “2017 SUSB Annual Data Tables by Establishment Industry” (Mar. \n2020), https://www.census.gov/data/tables/2017/econ/susb/2017-susb-annual.html (select “U.S. \nand states, NAICS sectors, small employment sizes less than 500” for statistics on firm size \nmeasured by number of employees). \n24 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 97   Filed 11/23/20   Page 25 of 86\nreligion.” See 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-1(a). The statute defines “religion” broadly to include “all \naspects of religious observance and practice, as well as belief.” 42 U.S.C. § 2000e(j).  \n113.  Congress enacted the Pregnancy Discrimination Act in 1978 to further define \nwhat constitutes “sex” discrimination under Title VII. It specified that the terms “because of sex” \nor “on the basis of sex” include “because of or on the basis of pregnancy, childbirth, or related \nmedical conditions.” 42 U.S.C. § 2000e(k). At the same time, Congress clarified that Title VII \n“shall not require an employer to pay for health insurance benefits for abortion.” Id.  \n3.  Anti-abortion provisions in or applicable to the Affordable Care Act  \n114.  The text, context, and history of the Affordable Care Act reflect clear \ncongressional intent that no group health plan is or should be required to cover abortion.  \n115.  The Act provides that “[n]otwithstanding any other provision of this title (or any \namendment made by this title) . . . nothing in this title (or any amendment made by this title), \nshall be construed to require a qualified health plan to provide coverage of [abortion] services . . . \nas part of its essential health benefits for any plan year.” 42 U.S.C. § 18023(b)(1)(A)(i).  \n116.  The Act provides that “the issuer of a qualified health plan shall determine \nwhether or not the plan provides coverage of [abortion] services . . . as part of such benefits for \nthe plan year.” Id. § 18023(b)(1)(A)(ii).  \n117.  The Act provides that “[n]othing in this Act shall be construed to have any effect \non Federal laws regarding (i) conscience protection; (ii) willingness or refusal to provide \nabortion; and (iii) discrimination on the basis of the willingness or refusal to provide, pay for, \ncover, or refer for abortion or to provide or participate in training to provide abortion.” Id. § \n18023(c)(2). \n118.  The Affordable Care Act itself does not contain a restriction on the use of federal \nfunds to pay for abortion services. This omission nearly defeated the Act’s passage when a group \n25 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 97   Filed 11/23/20   Page 26 of 86\nof pro-life Democrats in the House of Representatives, led by Rep. Bart Stupak of Michigan, \nthreatened to withhold their votes from the bill. To secure their votes, then-President Obama \nissued an executive order that prohibited the use of federal funds to pay for “abortion services \n. . . , consistent with a longstanding Federal statutory restriction that is commonly known as the \nHyde Amendment.” Exec. Order No. 13,535, Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act’s \nConsistency with Longstanding Restrictions on the Use of Federal Funds for Abortion, 3 C.F.R. \n201 (2010). \n119.  In addition, the Weldon Amendment—a feature of every appropriations act for \nHHS since 2005—provides, “None of the funds made available in this Act [making \nappropriations for the Departments of Labor and HHS] may be made available to a Federal \nagency or program, or to a State or local government, if such agency, program, or government \nsubjects any institutional or individual health care entity to discrimination on the basis that the \nhealth care entity does not provide, pay for, provide coverage of, or refer for abortions.” \nConsolidated Appropriations Act of 2012, Pub. L. No. 112-74, div. F, tit. V, § 507(d)(1), 125 \nStat. 786, 1111 (2011). The term “health care entity” includes “a health insurance plan.” Id. \n120.  The Affordable Care Act and the Weldon Amendment prohibit the government \nfrom coercing the consciences of healthcare providers that respect the sanctity of life. Executive \nOrder 13,535 reflects the federal government’s longstanding avoidance of coercing the \nconsciences of taxpayers that oppose abortion and government funding of abortion services.  \nB.  The 2016 Rule \n121.  On May 18, 2016, HHS finalized a rule pursuant to Section 1557 stating that \nimpermissible discrimination “on the basis of sex” “includes . . . discrimination on the basis of \n26 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 97   Filed 11/23/20   Page 27 of 86\n. . . termination of pregnancy, . . . sex stereotyping, and gender identity.” 81 Fed. Reg. 31,376, \n31,467 (May 18, 2016). Plaintiffs refer to this as the “2016 Rule.” \n122.  The 2016 Rule defines “gender identity” to include a person’s “internal sense of \ngender, which may be male, female, neither, or a combination of male and female.” Id.; see also \nid. at 31,392 (stating that the “gender identity spectrum includes an array of possible gender \nidentities beyond male and female”); id. at 31,384 (stating that individuals with “non-binary \ngender identities are protected under the rule”).  \n123.  The 2016 Rule defines “sex stereotypes” to mean “stereotypical notions of \nmasculinity or femininity, including expectations of how individuals represent or communicate \ntheir gender to others, such as behavior, clothing, hairstyles, activities, voice, mannerisms, or \nbody characteristics.” Id. at 31,468. \n124.  The 2016 Rule also defines sex discrimination to encompass discrimination based \non “termination of pregnancy” in covered programs. Id. at 31,467. HHS expressly declined “to \nstate explicitly” that it would not interpret this phrase as an abortion mandate, as commenters on \nthe proposed rule had urged it to do. Instead, HHS simply noted the existence of conscience \nprotections in federal law and ACA limitations on requiring abortion coverage. Id. at 31,388. \n125.  The 2016 Rule applies to a  “covered entity,” defined to mean “any entity that has \na health program or activity, any part of which receives Federal financial assistance from \n[HHS].” Id. at 31,445. HHS estimates that the 2016 Rule covers “almost all licensed physicians \nbecause they accept Federal financial assistance,” including payments from Medicare and \nMedicaid. Id. Other observers estimate that 2016 Rule applies “to over 133,000 (virtually all) \nhospitals, nursing homes, home health agencies, and similar provider facilities, about 445,000 \nclinical laboratories, 1,200 community health centers, 171 health-related schools, state Medicaid \n27 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 97   Filed 11/23/20   Page 28 of 86\nand CHIP programs, state public health agencies, federally facilitated and state-based \nmarketplaces, at least 180 health insurers that market policies through the [federally facilitated \nmarketplace] and state-based marketplaces, and up to 900,000 physicians.” Timothy Jost, \nImplementing Health Reform: HHS Proposes Rule Implementing Anti-Discrimination ACA \nProvisions (Contraceptive Coverage Litigation Update), Health Affairs Blog (Sept. 4, 2015), \nhttp://healthaffairs.org/blog/2015/09/04/implementing-health-reform-hhs-proposes-rule-\nimplementing-anti-discrimination-aca-provisions/.  \n126.  The 2016 Rule’s extension of Section 1557 to “gender identity” and “termination \nof pregnancy,” coupled with its expansive definition of a “covered entity,” means that (1) \nhealthcare providers are required to perform or refer for gender transition procedures, (2) \nhealthcare providers are required to alter their speech and medical advice, (3) covered employers \nand insurance providers are required to offer employee benefits covering gender transition \nprocedures, (4) sex-specific healthcare facilities and programs, including shower facilities and \nhospital wards, must be opened to individuals based on gender identity, among other \nrequirements. These are described in more detail below. \n1.  Healthcare professionals are required to perform or refer for gender \ntransition procedures. \n127.  The 2016 Rule requires healthcare providers and professionals to perform (or \nrefer for) gender transition procedures if they offer analogous services in other contexts. For \nexample, “[a] provider specializing in gynecological services that previously declined to provide \na medically necessary hysterectomy for a transgender man would have to revise its policy to \nprovide the procedure for transgender individuals in the same manner it provides the procedure \nfor other individuals.” 81 Fed. Reg. at 31,455. HHS explained that a hysterectomy in this gender \ntransition context would be “medically necessary to treat gender dysphoria,” id. at 31,429, \n28 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 97   Filed 11/23/20   Page 29 of 86\nthereby defining medical necessity, benefit, and prudence as a matter of federal law, without \nregard to the opinions, judgment, and conscientious considerations of the many medical \nprofessionals who hold views to the contrary. \n128.  HHS issued this Mandate despite the widespread, well-documented, ongoing \ndebate about the medical risks and ethics associated with various gender transition procedures, \neven within the transgender community itself. The 2016 Rule seeks to preempt the serious \nmedical and moral debate about gender transition procedures by concluding in the context of \nphysicians offering “health services” that a “categorization of all transition-related treatment . . . \nas experimental, is outdated and not based on current standards of care.” 81 Fed. Reg. at 31,435; \nsee also id. at 31,429. \n129.  In creating the Mandate, HHS disregarded the commenters that asked HHS to \nmake clear that health services need only be covered if they are deemed to be “medically \nnecessary” or “medically appropriate” in the professional opinion of those charged with the care \nof the patient. In response to these comments, HHS stated that under its 2016 Rule, some \nprocedures “related to gender transition” may be required even if they were not “strictly \nidentified as medically necessary or appropriate.” Id. at 31,435. Thus, under the rule, if a doctor \nwould perform a mastectomy as part of a medically-necessary treatment for breast cancer, it \nwould be illegal for the same doctor to decline to perform a mastectomy for a gender transition, \neven if the doctor believed that removing healthy breast tissue was contrary to the patient’s \nmedical interest. \n2.  Healthcare providers are required to alter their speech and medical \nadvice. \n130.  By concluding that it was “outdated and not based on current standards of care” \nfor a healthcare provider to “categoriz[e] all transition-related treatment . . . as experimental,” id., \n29 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 97   Filed 11/23/20   Page 30 of 86\nHHS has seriously curbed a Catholic healthcare entity’s ability to maintain policies and practices \nreflecting a contrary view, even if such a view is based on the entity’s religious convictions, \nconscientious beliefs, and medical judgment. The 2016 Rule thus forces Catholic healthcare \nproviders to alter their speech and medical advice. \n131.  The 2016 Rule compels the speech of healthcare institutions and professionals in \nseveral ways. For example, the rule mandates revisions to healthcare providers’ written policies, \nrequiring express affirmations that gender transition-related procedures would be provided, id. at \n31455, even if such revisions do not reflect the entity’s medical judgment, values, or beliefs. It \nrequires physicians to use gender-transition affirming language in all situations regardless of \ncircumstance and mandates, for example, that medical providers use “a transgender individual’s \npreferred name and pronoun,” id. at 31,406, and not “impose” a “binary view of gender,” id. at \n31,435. Thus, to avoid liability, healthcare providers are compelled to speak by revising their \npolicy to endorse gender transition-related services, to express language that is “affirming” of \ngender transition, and to express a non-binary view of gender. Further, by treating as \ndiscriminatory a medical view of “transition-related treatment . . . as experimental,” the rule \ncoerces healthcare providers to speak about these procedures the way the government wants \nthem to, even though they disagree and even though they believe they would disserve patients in \nso doing. \n3.  Covered employers and insurance providers are required to offer \nemployee benefits covering gender transition procedures. \n132.  The 2016 Rule prohibits certain employers, health programs, and insurance plans \nfrom exercising judgment as to what they cover. HHS stated, “[A]n explicit, categorical (or \nautomatic) exclusion or limitation of coverage for all health services related to gender transition \nis unlawful on its face.” Id. at 31,429. \n30 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 97   Filed 11/23/20   Page 31 of 86\n133.  For example, if a doctor concludes that a hysterectomy “is medically necessary to \ntreat gender dysphoria,” the patient’s employer or insurance plan is required to cover the \nprocedure on the same basis that it would cover it for other conditions (like cancer). Id. HHS also \nstated that the “range of transition-related services, which includes treatment for gender \ndysphoria, is not limited to surgical treatments and may include, but is not limited to, services \nsuch as hormone therapy and psychotherapy, which may occur over the lifetime of the \nindividual.” Id. at 31,435-36. As such, coverage is required under the 2016 Rule notwithstanding \nthe rights of employers, like Plaintiffs, that offer employee health benefits consistent with the \nreligious beliefs and values of their organizations. \n134.  This conflict with religious employers extends beyond treatment related to gender \ndysphoria because some required procedures (such as elective hysterectomies) result in \nsterilization, and the 2016 Rule also extends to “termination of pregnancy.”  \n135.  This health benefit requirement of the 2016 Rule applies to any of the following \ntypes of employers who receive HHS funding: (1) any entity principally involved in providing or \nadministering health services (including hospitals, nursing homes, counseling centers, \nphysicians’ offices, etc.), (2) any type of employer that receives HHS funding for the primary \npurpose of funding an “employee health benefit program,” and (3) any entity such as a university \nwith a health training or research program that receives HHS funding or Federal financial \nassistance for that “health program or activity.” See id. at 31,472, 31,437. Thus, any such \nemployers that have always offered employee health benefits that reflect their religious or \nconscientious beliefs, and that exclude gender transition procedures from employee benefits, are \nconsidered discriminatory under the 2016 Rule. \n31 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 97   Filed 11/23/20   Page 32 of 86\n136.  As a result of the 2016 Rule, some CBA members received notices from their \ninsurance companies that their health plans were changing. These changes were not requested by \nthese members. They were imposed involuntarily by the insurers on the ground that the changes \nwere mandated by the 2016 Rule. Exhibits E and F hereto are, respectively, the gender dysphoria \npolicies that United Healthcare and Blue Cross Blue Shield of Kansas City delivered to CBA \nmember dioceses – even those these dioceses are not themselves “covered entities” under the \n2016 Rule.  \n137.  The United Healthcare “Gender Dysphoria Rider” informed the diocese that its \nplan would now cover “[b]enefits for the treatment of Gender Dysphoria” and that any \n“exclusion for sex transformation operations and related services . . . is deleted.” Ex. E at 1, 3. \n“Benefits for the treatment of Gender Dysphoria” include psychotherapy, “[c]ross-sex hormone \ntherapy,” and “[s]urgery for the treatment of Gender Dysphoria.” Id. The latter category of \nsurgery includes “Male to female surgeries” such as orchiectomy and penectomy (removal of \ntesticles and penis) and clitoroplasty, labiaplasty, and vaginoplasty (creation of a clitoris, labia, \nand vagina). It also includes “Female to male surgeries” such as mastectomy, hysterectomy, \nvulvectomy and vaginectomy (removal of vulva and vagina), and metoidioplasty and \nphalloplasty (creation of penis).  \n138.  After receiving notice of the United Healthcare rider in the mail, the CBA \nmember diocese called the insurance company to demand the rider be removed from its plan.  \nThe insurer refused, informing the diocese that its plan must include the rider a result of the 2016 \nRule. \n139.  The Blue Cross Blue Shield of Kansas City “Treatment of Gender Dysphoria” \nPolicy informed the covered diocese that “[i]f coverage for gender reassignment surgery is \n32 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 97   Filed 11/23/20   Page 33 of 86\navailable per the member’s benefit, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Kansas City (Blue KC) will \nprovide coverage for treatment of gender dysphoria including gender reassignment surgery when \nit is determined to be medically necessary.” Ex. F at 1. Under the policy, the diocesan plan \ncovers “[p]sychotherapy for gender dysphoria”; “Continuous Hormone Replacement Therapy” \nwith “[h]ormones of the desired gender,” and surgeries for a “medically necessary initial gender \nreassignment,” such as those identified above. \n140.  After receiving notice of the Blue Cross Blue Shield policy, the CBA member \ndiocese called the insurer and was informed that the policy applied to the diocese’s plan as a \nresult of 2016 Rule.  \n4.  Sex-specific healthcare facilities or programs, including shower \nfacilities or hospital wards, must be opened to individuals based on \ngender identity. \n141.  With regard to facilities, the 2016 Rule states that even for sex-specific facilities \nsuch as “shower facilities” offered by healthcare providers, individuals cannot be excluded \n“based on their gender identity.” 81 Fed. Reg. at 31,409. \n142.  When Title IX—the foundation for the 2016 Rule—was enacted, Congress \nensured that it protected and preserved the privacy rights of individuals in intimate areas. See 20 \nU.S.C. § 1686; 117 Cong. Rec. 30407 (1971); 117 Cong. Rec. 39260 (1971); 117 Cong. Rec. \n39263 (1971),; 118 Cong. Rec. 5807 (1972). HHS’s predecessor, the Department of Health, \nEducation, and Welfare, promulgated regulations guaranteeing the privacy of individuals in \nintimate areas. See 34 C.F.R. § 106.32(b); 34 C.F.R. § 106.33 (“A recipient may provide separate \ntoilet, locker room, and shower facilities on the basis of sex . . . .”). But in the 2016 Rule, HHS \nwholly disregarded any “legal right to privacy” that could be violated “simply by permitting \nanother person access to a sex-specific program or facility which corresponds to their gender \nidentity.” 81 Fed. Reg. at 31,389, 31,409.  \n33 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 97   Filed 11/23/20   Page 34 of 86\n143.  With regard to other health programs, HHS stated that sex-specific health \nprograms or activities are permissible only if the covered entity could demonstrate “an \nexceedingly persuasive justification, that is, that the sex-specific program is substantially related \nto the achievement of an important health-related or scientific objective.” Id. at 31,468. HHS \nstated that it would “expect a covered entity to supply objective evidence, and empirical data if \navailable, to justify the need to restrict participation in the program to only one sex,” and in “no \ncase” would HHS “accept a justification that relies on overly broad generalizations about the \nsexes.” Id.  \n5.  Other requirements of the 2016 Rule \n144.  The 2016 Rule requires that covered entities applying for federal financial \nassistance affirm up front that they will comply with the rule. Id. at 31,468.  \n145.  The rule also requires covered entities to post notices regarding compliance with \nthe 2016 Rule in conspicuous locations. HHS provided a sample notice in Appendix A to the \nrule, which stated in relevant part that the covered entity “does not exclude people or treat them \ndifferently because of race, color, national origin, age, disability, or sex.” Id. at 31,472. \n146.  Covered entities are required to train employees on the requirements of the 2016 \nRule. See id. at 31,452, 31,458-59. This training mandate creates ethical challenges, notably a \ncompelled speech problem, for CBA members in the healthcare field. HHS estimated that \ncovered entities would have to spend $371.7 million dollars to train their employees on the \nrequirements of the rule. Id. at 31,452. \n34 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 97   Filed 11/23/20   Page 35 of 86\n6.  HHS rejected calls to accommodate religious exercise in the 2016 \nRule. \n147.  HHS was aware that the 2016 Rule would substantially burden the religious \nexercise of religious hospitals, churches, ministries, and other employers. See id. at 31,378.  \n148.  During the comment period, many religious organizations voiced their alarm at \nthe scope of the earlier proposed rule and explained why it was essential for HHS to include \nadequate protections for religious employers and healthcare organizations. For example, the \nUnited States Conference of Catholic Bishops joined with the National Association of \nEvangelicals, the Christian Medical Association, the National Catholic Bioethics Center, and \nother religious organizations to submit comments explaining how HHS’s proposed rules would \naffect religious employers and urging HHS to protect religious exercise. See Comments from \nUSCCB et al., supra, note 2.  \n149.  Recall that Section 1557 does not independently prohibit discrimination, but \ninstead references four preexisting laws: Title VI, Title IX, the Age Act, and the Rehabilitation \nAct (Section 504). HHS faithfully incorporated the exemptions applicable to Title VI, the Age \nAct, and the Rehabilitation Act into its 2016 Rule:  \nThe exceptions applicable to Title VI apply to discrimination on the basis of race, \ncolor, or national origin under this part. The exceptions applicable to Section 504 \napply to discrimination on the basis of disability under this part. The exceptions \napplicable to the Age Act apply to discrimination on the basis of age under this part.  \n81 Fed Reg. at 31,470 (emphases added). \n150.  But when it came to Title IX, HHS changed course. Unlike its treatment of the \nother thee statutes cited in Section 1557, HHS refused to incorporated Title IX’s religious \nexemption. 81 Fed. Reg. at 31,380. Instead of incorporating Title IX’s religious exemption or \notherwise recognizing the burden that its rule would place on religious healthcare providers and \nother religious employers, HHS merely stated that religious objectors could assert claims under \n35 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 97   Filed 11/23/20   Page 36 of 86\nexisting statutory protections for religious freedom. Id. at 31,376. But HHS also failed to provide \nany mechanism by which a religious entity could determine if it was entitled to any existing \nreligious protections under the law.  \n151.  The 2016 Rule was, in this regard, even more extreme and unyielding than the \ncontraceptive/abortifacient mandate that HHS created based on another section of the Affordable \nCare Act. See Sharpe Holdings, Inc. v. U.S. Dep’t of Health & Human Servs., 801 F.3d 927, 933-\n35 (8th Cir. 2015) (describing HHS’s contraceptive and abortifacient mandate). While HHS \nreluctantly decided to exempt a narrowly defined group of “religious employers” from its \nabortifacient and contraception mandate, id. at 933, it declined to exempt any religious \nemployers from the 2016 Rule. And while many non-exempt religious employers could avoid the \ncontraceptive/abortifacient mandate (though at substantial cost) by maintaining a grandfathered \ngroup health plan, there is no grandfather exemption from the requirements of Section 1557 or \nthe 2016 Rule. \n152.  Even while refusing to exempt religious organizations from its Mandate, the \ngovernment has exempted its own insurance programs. TRICARE, the military’s insurance \nprogram, does not cover “surgery for gender dysphoria.” TRICARE, Covered Services, Gender \nDysphoria Services (last updated June 18, 2020).5 A TRICARE guidance memo states that in the \ncontext of gender dysphoria treatment, “[i]n no circumstance will a provider be required to \ndeliver care that he or she feels unprepared to provide either by lack of clinical skill or due to \n \n5 Available at https://tricare.mil/CoveredServices/IsItCovered/GenderDysphoriaServices.  \n36 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 97   Filed 11/23/20   Page 37 of 86\nethical, moral, or religious beliefs.”6 Yet no similar protections for providers’ medical judgment \nor religious beliefs are offered under the 2016 Rule. \n153.  Further, Medicare and Medicaid do not require coverage for gender reassignment \nsurgery, but allow states and local administrators to make coverage determinations on a case-by-\ncase basis. Ctrs. for Medicare & Medicaid Servs., Decision Memo for Gender Dysphoria and \nGender Reassignment Surgery (Aug. 30, 2016).7 The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, \nwhich is part of HHS, concluded that “there is not enough evidence to determine whether gender \nreassignment surgery improves health outcomes” because while some studies “reported \nbenefits,” “others reported harms.” Ctrs. for Medicare & Medicaid Servs., Proposed Decision \nMemo for Gender Dysphoria and Gender Reassignment Surgery (June 2, 2016).8 \nC.  The EEOC, invoking Title VII, has imposed on non-covered entities the \nMandate’s requirement of gender-transition coverage. \n154.  Although the 2016 Rule directly applies only to “covered entities,” it announces \nthat the EEOC will enforce a similar rule against employers under Title VII. The 2016 Rule \ndeclares that where HHS “lacks jurisdiction over an employer,” it will “refer or transfer the \nmatter to the EEOC and allow that agency to address the matter.” Id. at 31,432. When Section \n1557 does not apply, claims may be brought against employers under Title VII. Id. at 31,404. \nHHS decided that, for non-healthcare entities, Title VII was better suited to “address claims that \n \n6 Memo. from Karen S.

The EEOC confirmed to HHS it would cooperate in such matters, indicating that \n“the date a complaint was filed with [HHS] will be deemed the date it was filed with the EEOC.” \nId. at 31,432. \n156.  In the context of Title VII, the EEOC has adopted similar substantive standards as \nHHS. When the 2016 Rule was promulgated, the EEOC interpreted Title VII as prohibiting \ndiscrimination against employees on the basis of “transgender status.” EEOC, What You Should \nKnow About EEOC and the Enforcement Protections for LGBT Workers.9 The EEOC maintains \nthis interpretation today. See EEOC, What You Should Know: The EEOC and Protections for \nLGBT Workers (“EEOC Statement”).10  \n157.  The EEOC has specifically enforced this interpretation by requiring employer \nhealth plans to cover “medically necessary care based on transgender status.” EEOC, Deluxe \nFinancial to Settle Sex Discrimination Suit on Behalf of Transgender Employee, 2016 WL \n246967 (Jan. 21, 2016) (noting that three-year consent decree with employer “provides that, as of \nJanuary 1, 2016, [employer’s] national health benefits plan will not include any partial or \ncategorical exclusion for otherwise medically necessary care based on transgender status”). \n158.  Dignity Health is one of the largest healthcare systems in the United States, and \nincludes many Catholic hospitals.  In June 2016, Josef Robinson, a transgender male, sued \n \n9 This EEOC Statement was previously available at https://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/newsroom/\nwysk/enforcement_protections_lgbt_workers.cfm.

The \nforegoing URL now redirects to the URL in note 10, infra. \n10 Available at https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/guidance/what-you-should-know-eeoc-and-\nprotections-lgbt-workers.  \n38 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 97   Filed 11/23/20   Page 39 of 86\nDignity Health for maintaining an employee health plan that categorically excluded coverage for \ngender transition services. Robinson’s complaint asserted a violation of Title VII, claiming that \n“[d]iscrimination on the basis of transgender status or gender nonconformity is discrimination on \nthe basis of ‘sex’ under Title VII,” and that the hospital’s exclusion of transgender surgery \nconstituted a violation of Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act. EEOC filed an amicus brief \nin the case in support of Robinson, arguing that the employer’s transgender exclusion violated \nTitle VII by denying Robinson “access to medically necessary treatment for his gender \ndysphoria, a serious health condition directly related to the fact that he is transgender.” Amicus \nBrief of EEOC in Support of Plaintiff, Robinson v. Dignity Health, 16-cv-03035 YGR (N.D. \nCal.) (filed Aug. 22, 2016).11 \n159.  The EEOC has taken enforcement action against other employers for the \n“categorical exclusion” from their health plans of “services related to transgender treatment/sex \ntherapy.” Soc’y for Human Res. Mgmt., Wal-Mart Loses Perfect LGBTQ Rating Because of \nTransgender Harassment, Nov. 30, 2017.12 \n160.  Since promulgating the guidance and taking the positions and enforcement actions \ndescribed above, the EEOC has never changed its interpretation or application of Title VII.  \n161.  Accordingly, it is the policy and official position of the EEOC, based on the \nEEOC Statement and the agency’s actual enforcement actions, that exclusion of gender-\ntransition coverage in employer health plans constitutes a violation of Title VII’s ban on “sex” \ndiscrimination. \n \n11 Available at https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/eeoc/litigation/briefs/\nrobinson.html.  \n12 Available at https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/legal-and-compliance/employment-\nlaw/pages/wal-mart-lgbtq-rating.aspx.  \n39 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 97   Filed 11/23/20   Page 40 of 86\nD.  Enforcement Mechanisms \n162.  CBA members that do not comply with the Mandate may face enforcement \nactions initiated by federal agencies or by individuals who allege they have been discriminated \nagainst. \n163.  The 2016 Rule subjects “covered entities” to enforcement actions brought by \nHHS’s Office of Civil Rights (“OCR”). If the Director of OCR concludes that a covered entity \nhad discriminated on the basis of “gender identity” or “termination of pregnancy,” the entity \nwould have to take “remedial action . . . to overcome the effects of the discrimination.” 81 Fed. \nReg. at 31,468. If it refuses, OCR could initiate an administrative procedure to terminate the \nentity’s HHS funding. Id. at 31,472, 31,439. \n164.  The 2016 Rule also empowers OCR to compel covered entities to record and \nsubmit compliance reports under Section 1557. Id. at 31,439, 31,472. \n165.  Under the 2016 Rule, where HHS does not have jurisdiction over an alleged \ndiscriminatory act, it said it would refer the matter to the EEOC for enforcement under Title VII. \nSimilar to HHS’s authority under Section 1557, the EEOC has authority to investigate alleged \nTitle VII violations and will ask violators to voluntarily take corrective action for the \ndiscriminatory behavior. 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(a). \n166.  If HHS or the EEOC are dissatisfied with an entity’s corrective remedial actions, \nthe 2016 Rule permits referral of the matter to the Department of Justice to bring a federal \nlawsuit to enforce federal civil rights laws. See, e.g., 81 Fed. Reg. at 31,439, 31,441. \n167.  Title VII creates a private right of action. In the 2016 Rule, HHS interpreted \nSection 1557 as authorizing a private right of action. See id. at 31,440. This means that \n40 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 97   Filed 11/23/20   Page 41 of 86\nindividuals who believe they have been discriminated against on the basis of gender identity may \nbring their own federal lawsuits. These laws can also be enforced by class action suits. \n168.  Sanctions for failing to comply with the 2016 Rule are severe. They include \ncompensatory damages, punitive damages, treble damages, civil penalties, attorney fees, \ninjunctive relief, and even loss of federal funding.  \n169.  Loss of federal funding: Catholic healthcare entities subject to the 2016 Rule risk \nthe denial or discontinuance of federal funding if they do not comply. Id. at 31,472. HHS Form \n690 makes compliance “a condition of continued receipt of Federal financial assistance” and \nauthorizes the government “to seek judicial enforcement of this assurance.”  \n170.  Civil and criminal penalties and treble damages: Covered entities that submit \nHHS Form 690 but do not comply with the 2016 Rule could be liable under the False Claims \nAct, which authorizes a civil penalty of up to $11,000 for each false claim, “plus 3 times the \namount of damages which the Government sustains because of” the false claim. 31 U.S.C. § \n3729(a)(1). False claims related to a health program may also subject responsible persons to \nfines and up to five years imprisonment under 18 U.S.C. § 1035. \n171.  Compensatory damages: Catholic employers that violate the 2016 Rule may be \nsubject to compensatory damages under Section 1557 or under Title VII. 81 Fed. Reg. at 31,472 \n(“The enforcement mechanisms available for and provided under . . . Title IX . . . shall apply for \npurposes of Section 1557.”); Franklin v. Gwinnett Cnty. Pub. Schs., 503 U.S. 60, 76 (1992) \n(compensatory damages available under Title IX); 42 U.S.C. § 1981a(b)(3) (compensatory \ndamages available under Title VII). Compensatory damages may include pecuniary losses and \neven nonpecuniary losses such as “emotional pain” and “mental anguish.” 42 U.S.C. § \n1981a(b)(3); Williams v. Pharmacia, Inc., 137 F.3d 944, 954 (7th Cir. 1998). \n41 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 97   Filed 11/23/20   Page 42 of 86\n172.  Punitive damages: Punitive damages are available under Title VII if the employer \nacted “with malice or with reckless indifference to the federally protected rights” of an \nemployee. 42 U.S.C. § 1981a(b)(1). Punitive damages are subject to the same statutory caps that \nare imposed for nonpecuniary losses. See id. § 1981a(b)(3).  \n173.  Injunctive relief: Courts may order broad forms of injunctive relief under Title \nVII, see 42 U.S.C. §2000e-5(g)(1); United States v. Criminal Sheriff, Parish of Orleans, 19 F.3d \n238, 239 (5th Cir. 1994), and may even mandate that employers adopt certain policies, see, e.g., \nMorris v. Am. Nat’l Can Corp., 730 F. Supp. 1489, 1498 (E.D. Mo.1989), aff’d in part, rev’d in \npart on other grounds, 941 F.2d 710 (8th Cir. 1991); Robinson v. Jacksonville Shipyards, Inc., \n760 F. Supp. 1486 (M.D. Fla. 1991). Title IX, and hence Section 1557, also permit broad \ninjunctive relief. See Roberts v. Colo. State Bd. of Agriculture, 998 F.2d 824, 826 (10th Cir. \n1993).  \n174.  Attorney’s fees: Under Title VII and Section 1557, a prevailing party is entitled to \ncosts and attorney’s fees. See 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(k); id. § 1988(b).  \nVI.  HHS’S UNSUCCESSFUL EFFORT TO REPEAL THE MANDATE \nA.  Litigation against the 2016 Rule \n175.  On December 31, 2016, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas \nissued a nationwide preliminary injunction prohibiting HHS from “enforcing the [2016] Rule’s \nprohibition against discrimination on the basis of gender identity or termination of pregnancy.” \nFranciscan Alliance, Inc. v. Burwell, No. 16-cv-108, 227 F. Supp. 3d 660, 696 (N.D. Tex. 2016). \nThe court concluded that the rule’s “expanded definition of sex discrimination” exceeded HHS’s \nstatutory authority under Section 1557, and that the rule’s failure to incorporate the religious and \nabortion exemptions in Title IX “renders the Rule contrary to law” in violation of the APA. Id. at \n689, 691. The court also found that that the rule violated RFRA because it placed “substantial \n42 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 97   Filed 11/23/20   Page 43 of 86\npressure on Plaintiffs to perform and cover [gender] transition and abortion procedures” in \nviolation of their religious beliefs, and HHS could not show that the rule satisfied RFRA’s \nrequirement of strict scrutiny. Id. at 692-93. \n176.  On October 15, 2019, as clarified in an order of November 21, 2019, the same \ncourt entered summary judgment vacating the 2016 Rule “insofar as the Rule defines ‘On the \nbasis of sex’ to include gender identity and termination of pregnancy,” and remanded to HHS for \nfurther consideration. See Franciscan Alliance, Inc. v. Azar, No. 16-cv-108-O, ECF Nos. 175, \n182 (N.D. Tex.). \n177.  On December 30, 2016, the Court in this case issued an order temporarily staying \nenforcement of the 2016 Rule against Plaintiffs. ECF No. 23. On January 23, 2017, the Court \namended its December 30 order “to make clear that it temporarily stays enforcement, as to the \nnamed Plaintiffs, of Section 1557’s prohibitions against discrimination on the bases of gender \nidentity and termination of pregnancy.” ECF No. 36.  \nB.  The 2020 Rule \n178.  In May 2019, HHS issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, and in June 2019 it \npublished a proposed rule, to amend the 2016 Rule. See Nondiscrimination in Health and Health \nEducation Programs or Activities, 84 Fed. Reg. 27,846 (June 14, 2019). Citing the Franciscan \nAlliance court’s preliminary-injunction decision, the proposed rule stated that the Rule’s \ndefinition of “sex” “exceeded [HHS’s] authority under Section 1557.” Id. at 27,849. The \nproposed rule sought to address this issue by repealing the 2016 Rule’s definition of “sex” in its \nentirety, which, HHS said, would “allow the Federal courts, in particular, the U.S. Supreme \nCourt . . . to resolve any dispute about the proper legal interpretation of” the term “sex” in \nSection 1557. Id. at 27,873. As the proposed rule noted, see id. at 27,855, the Supreme Court had \n43 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 97   Filed 11/23/20   Page 44 of 86\nrecently granted certiorari to decide whether sex discrimination under Title VII included \ndiscrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity, in three cases that would \nlater be decided together as Bostock v. Clayton County, 140 S. Ct. 1731 (2020).  \n179.  On June 12, 2020, HHS finalized its new rule, the “2020 Rule.” See \nNondiscrimination in Health and Health Education Programs or Activities, 85 Fed. Reg. 37,160 \n(June 19, 2020). \n180.  The 2020 Rule would have taken effect on August 18, 2020. Id. at 37,160. \n181.  The 2020 Rule seeks to repeal certain portions of the 2016 Rule, and in particular, \n“omits the vacated language concerning gender identity and termination of pregnancy.” Id. at \n37,162; see also id. at 32,236 (“[T]his final rule removes . . . the expansive inclusion of gender \nidentity and sex stereotyping in the definition of sex discrimination.”). But HHS declined to \nreplace the 2016 Rule’s definition of “sex” with a new definition, reasoning instead that the \nSupreme Court’s then-forthcoming decision in Bostock would “likely have ramifications for the \ndefinition of ‘on the basis of sex’ under Title IX.” Id. at 37,168. Thus, simply repealing the prior \ndefinition would permit “application of the [Bostock] Court’s construction.” Id. \n182.  Responding to the Franciscan Alliance court’s vacatur order, HHS said that, \nunder the 2020 Rule, it “will interpret Section 1557’s prohibition on sex-based discrimination \nconsistent with Title IX and its implementing regulations,” id. at 37,192, and that it was \namending its Title IX regulations “to explicitly incorporate relevant statutory exemptions from \nTitle IX, including abortion neutrality and the religious exemption,” id. at 37,162. \n1.  Gender identity \n183.  The 2020 Rule seeks to clarify that Section 1557 does not require healthcare \nprofessionals to perform gender transition procedures. Id. at 37,188. HHS “believes providers \nshould be generally free to use their best medical judgment, consistent with their understanding \n44 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 97   Filed 11/23/20   Page 45 of 86\nof medical ethics, in providing healthcare to Americans.” Id. at 37,187. “[T]he 2016 Rule \ninappropriately interfered with the ethical and medical judgment of health professionals.” Id. The \n2020 Rule “does not presume to dictate to medical providers the degree to which sex matters in \nmedical decision making, nor does it impose the 2016 Rule’s vague and overbroad mandate that \nthey ‘treat individuals consistent with their gender identity.’” Id. at 37,188. \n184.  The 2020 Rule seeks to “clarif[y] that sex, according to the Title IX’s plain \nmeaning, may be taken into account in the provision of healthcare, insurance (including \ninsurance coverage), and health research, as was the practice before the 2016 Rule.” Id. at \n37,189. At the same time, the 2020 Rule does not “prohibi[t] a healthcare provider from offering \nor performing sex-reassignment treatments and surgeries, or an insurer from covering such \ntreatments and procedures, either as a general matter or on a case-by-case basis.” Id. at 37,188. \n185.  While the 2016 Rule prohibits health insurers from “hav[ing] or implement[ing] a \ncategorical coverage exclusion or limitation for all health services related to gender transition,” \nid. at 37,196  (quotation omitted), the 2020 Rule seeks to repeal this prohibition, noting that there \nis a lack of “medical consensus to support one or another form of treatment for gender \ndysphoria,” id. at 37,198. In HHS’s view, “the 2016 Rule did not give sufficient evidence to \njustify, as a matter of policy, its prohibition on blanket exclusions of coverage for sex-\nreassignment procedures.” Id. Even if it were appropriate policy to mandate the provision and \ncoverage of gender transition procedures, HHS could not do so “through application of Section \n1557 and Title IX” because “[t]here is no statutory authority to require the provision or coverage \nof such procedures under Title IX protections from discrimination on the basis of sex.” Id. \n2.  Abortion \n186.  The 2020 Rule seeks to repeal the 2016 Rule’s provisions related to “termination \nof pregnancy.” The 2020 Rule prohibits discrimination on “the grounds prohibited under . . . \n45 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 97   Filed 11/23/20   Page 46 of 86\nTitle IX,” and revises HHS’s Title IX regulations to explicitly incorporate Title IX’s abortion \nexemption. Id. at 37,192-93. HHS did this, it said, “to ensure those [Title IX] regulations are \nimplemented consistent with the statute.” Id. at 37,192.  \n187.  The 2020 Rule does not seek to add any separate, abortion-related conscience \nprotection because, in HHS’s view, it is unnecessary in light of the Title IX abortion exemption, \nthe explicit incorporation of that exemption into HHS’s revised Title IX regulations, and the \n2020 Rule’s requirement that Section 1557 be construed consistently with Title IX. See id. at \n37,193. \n3.  Protections for religious freedom and conscience \n188.  The 2020 Rule “does not craft a religious exemption to Section 1557.” Id. at \n37,207. Rather, it “simply states that the Section 1557 regulation will be implemented consistent \nwith” various religious and conscience protections already present in federal law, “including \nRFRA, healthcare conscience statutes, and the religious organization exception in Title IX.” Id. \n189.  Accordingly, the 2020 Rule states that “[i]nsofar as the application of any \nrequirement under this part would violate, depart from, or contradict definitions, exemptions, \naffirmative rights, or protections provided by” Title IX, RFRA, and numerous other federal laws \nprotecting conscience, “such application shall not be imposed or required.” 45 C.F.R. § 92.6(b). \n190.  HHS stated that it “agrees with the court in Franciscan Alliance that particular \nprovisions in the 2016 Rule violated RFRA as applied to private plaintiffs.” 85 Fed. Reg. at \n32,707. Regarding the 2016 Rule’s gender identity provisions, HHS conceded that it “sees no \ncompelling interest in forcing the provision, or coverage, of . . . medically controversial [gender \ntransition] services by covered entities, much less in doing so without a statutory basis.” Id. at \n37,188. And regarding the 2016 Rule’s “termination of pregnancy” provisions, HHS stated that \nthe Franciscan Alliance court “rightly held that [HHS] regulations forbidding discrimination on \n46 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 97   Filed 11/23/20   Page 47 of 86\nthe basis of sex must be construed in light of the underlying text of Title IX, including abortion \nneutrality.” Id. at 37,218. \n4.  Covered entities \n191.  Like the 2016 Rule, the 2020 Rule seeks to make Section 1557 applicable to “any \nentity that has a health program or activity, any part of which receives Federal financial \nassistance from [HHS].” Id. at 37,226. If an entity receives HHS funds and is “principally \nengaged in the business of providing healthcare,” then Section 1557 applies to the entity as a \nwhole. Id. at 37,244. Otherwise, Section 1557 applies only to the “health program or activity” of \nthe entity that receives HHS funds. See id. \n192.  The 2020 Rule seeks to narrow the application of Section 1557 to health \ninsurance issuers. While the 2016 Rule declares that health insurance issuers are entities \n“principally engaged in the business of providing healthcare,” the 2020 Rule seeks to repeal this \naspect of the 2016 Rule and clarify that the provision of health insurance coverage is not per se \nthe provision of “healthcare.” Under the new rule, “an entity principally or otherwise engaged in \nthe business of providing health insurance shall not, by virtue of such provision, be considered to \nbe principally engaged in the business of providing healthcare.” Id. at 37,244-45 (45 C.F.R. § \n92.3(c)). Thus, a health insurance issuer not principally engaged in the business of healthcare \nwould be subject to Section 1557 only to the extent of any federally funded health program or \nactivity of the issuer. \n193.  The 2020 Rule states that employer-sponsored (i.e., self-insured) health plans are \nnot covered entities “[t]o the extent that [they] do not receive Federal financial assistance and are \nnot principally engaged in the business of providing healthcare.” Id. at 37,173. \n47 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 97   Filed 11/23/20   Page 48 of 86\n5.  Enforcement mechanisms \n194.  The 2020 Rule seeks to repeal the “patchwork” of enforcement mechanisms \ncontained in the 2016 Rule, and to adopt the enforcement mechanisms of the four statutes which \nSection 1557 incorporates along with “their implementing regulations respectively, each for its \nown statute.” Id. at 37,202; see also Doe v. BlueCross BlueShield of Tennessee, Inc., 926 F.3d \n235, 240 (6th Cir. 2019) (stating that the 2016 Rule’s blending of different enforcement \nmechanisms under Section 1557 “failed to respect” the plain language of Section 1557); Briscoe \nv. Health Care Serv. Corp., 281 F. Supp. 3d 725, 738 (N.D. Ill. 2017) (language of Section 1557 \n“unambiguously demonstrate[s] Congress’s intent to import the various different standards and \nburdens of proof into a Section 1557 claim, depending upon the protected class at issue” \n(quotation omitted)). \n195.  Because the incorporated statutes and their implementing regulations contain their \nown enforcement mechanisms, the enforcement mechanisms described above for the 2016 Rule \ncontinue to apply, in substantial part, under the 2020 Rule. \n196.  In the 2020 Rule, HHS declined to “to take a position in its regulations on the \nissue of whether Section 1557 provides a private right of action.” Id. at 37,203. HHS stated that, \n“[t]o the extent that Section 1557 permits private rights of action, plaintiffs can assert claims \nunder Section 1557 itself rather than under the Department’s Section 1557 regulation.” Id. \n197.  Courts have held that Section 1557 authorizes a private right of action to the \nextent that the incorporated statutes do. See Doe, 926 F.3d at 239; Briscoe, 281 F. Supp. 3d at \n737. \nC.  Bostock v. Clayton County \n198.  On June 15, 2020, the Supreme Court decided Bostock. The Court held that when \n“an employer . . . fires someone simply for being homosexual or transgender,” the employer has \n48 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 97   Filed 11/23/20   Page 49 of 86\n“discriminated against that individual ‘because of such individual’s sex’” within the meaning of \nTitle VII. 140 S. Ct. at 1753.  \n199.  Bostock did not hold that the term “sex” in Title VII equates to gender identity. \nRather, the Bostock  Court “assum[ed]” that “sex” means biological sex. Id. at 1739. But the \nCourt reasoned that if an employer “fires a transgender person who was identified as a male at \nbirth but who now identifies as a female,” while “retain[ing] an otherwise identical employee \nwho was identified as female at birth,” then “the individual employee’s sex plays an \nunmistakable and impermissible role in the discharge decision.” Id. at 1741-42.  \n200.  The Court cautioned, however, that its opinion did not “prejudge” the proper \ninterpretation of “other federal . . . laws that prohibit sex discrimination,” id. at 1753, including \nSection 1557 and Title IX, see id. at 1779-82 & n.57 (Alito, J., dissenting).  \n201.  The Court further said it was “deeply concerned with preserving the promise of \nthe free exercise of religion,” and emphasized that the First Amendment and RFRA, among other \nlaws, protect religious employers against being forced to “violate their religious convictions.” Id. \nat 1754. Religious liberty protections, the Court explained, may “supersede Title VII’s \ncommands in appropriate cases.” Id.  \n202.  Bostock also instructs court to read statutes “in accord with the[ir] ordinary public \nmeaning.” Id. at 1738.  \nD.  Legal challenges to, and preliminary injunctions against, the 2020 Rule \n203.  Before the 2020 Rule could take effect, on August 17, 2020, the U.S. District \nCourt for the Eastern District of New York entered “a stay and preliminary injunction to \npreclude the [2020 Rule] from becoming operative.” Walker v. Azar, 2020 WL 4749859, at *1 \n(E.D.N.Y. 2020). The court concluded that the 2020 Rule is “contrary to Bostock,” that HHS’s \n49 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 97   Filed 11/23/20   Page 50 of 86\nattempt to repeal the 2016 Rule was “contrary to law,” and that the plaintiffs were likely to \nsucceed on the merits of their APA claim. Id. at *1, *9. The court acknowledged that the \nFranciscan Alliance court had vacated the 2016 Rule in part and “agree[d] that it has no power \nto revive a rule vacated by another district court.” Id. at *7. The court nonetheless thought that \n“Franciscan Alliance did not address the concept of ‘sex stereotyping’ embodied in the 2016 \nRule.” Id. The court entered the following order: \n[T]he Court stays the repeal of the 2016 definition of discrimination on the basis of sex. \nAs a result, the definitions of “on the basis of sex,” “gender identity,” and “sex \nstereotyping” currently set forth in 45 C.F.R. § 92.4 [sic] will remain in effect. In \naddition, the Court preliminarily enjoins the defendants from enforcing the repeal. \n \n204.  The Walker court’s preliminary injunction reinstates the 2016 Rule and the \nMandate. \n205.  On September 2, 2020, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia \nentered a nationwide preliminary injunction against aspects of the 2020 Rule. See Whitman-\nWalker Clinic, Inc. v. U.S. Dep’t of Health & Human Servs., 2020 WL 5232076, at *45 (D.D.C. \n2020).  \n206.  Citing the Franciscan Alliance vacatur, the court acknowledged that it had “no \nauthority . . . to disregard the final order of a district court vacating part of a regulation.” Id. at \n*13. But the court distinguished between what it called the “‘gender identity’ portion” of the \n2016 Rule and that rule’s “prohibition on discrimination based on sex stereotyping.” Id. at *14. \nBelieving that Franciscan Alliance vacated only the former “portion,” the court enjoined the \n2020 Rule to the extent that it “eliminated ‘sex stereotyping’ from the [2016] Rule’s definition of \n‘discrimination on the basis of sex.” Id. at *1, *45.  \n207.  The court also held that HHS erroneously incorporated Title IX’s religious \nexemption into its new rule without considering “the potential negative consequences that \n50 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 97   Filed 11/23/20   Page 51 of 86\nimporting a blanket religious exemption into Section 1557 might have for access to health care.” \nId. at *28. The court stated, however, that “nothing in this decision renders religiously affiliated \nproviders devoid of protection” and identified two “statutory safeguards”: the ACA’s explicit \nconscience and abortion protections, 42 U.S.C. § 18023(c)(2), and RFRA. Id. at *29. \n208.  The court refused to invalidate the provision of the 2020 Rule that repealed the \n2016 Rule’s prohibition on categorical coverage exclusions for gender-transition services. The \ncourt was satisfied that HHS had “thoroughly considered the evidence” on this issue and that it \nwas “not this Court’s place to resolve this scientific debate.” Id. at *31. \n209.  The court concluded that HHS is “preliminarily enjoined from enforcing the \nrepeal of the 2016 Rule’s definition of discrimination ‘[o]n the basis of sex’ insofar as it includes \n‘discrimination on the basis of . . . sex stereotyping’” and “from enforcing its incorporation of \nthe religious exemption contained in Title IX.” Id. at *45. \n1.  Effect of the preliminary injunctions against the 2020 Rule \n210.  The two preliminary injunctions against the 2020 Rule “overla[p]” with one \nanother. Id. at *41.  \n211.  The court’s order in Walker noted that the 2016 Rule’s definition of \ndiscrimination “on the basis of sex” includes discrimination based on “gender identity,” “sex \nstereotyping,” and “termination of pregnancy.” 2020 WL 4749859 at *1. The court’s order “stays \nthe repeal of the 2016 definition of discrimination on the basis of sex”; states that this definition, \nalong with the 2016 definitions of “gender identity” and “sex stereotyping” “will remain in \neffect”; and enjoins HHS “from enforcing the repeal.” Id. at *10. \n212.  The Whitman-Walker Clinic court purported to distinguish between a “gender \nidentity” portion and a “sex stereotyping” portion of the 2016 Rule, and then “enjoined . . . the \nrepeal” of the “sex stereotyping” portion. But even that court acknowledged that these two \n51 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 97   Filed 11/23/20   Page 52 of 86\n“portions” of the 2016 Rule could not be “meaningfully separated” because “the belief that an \nindividual should identify with only their birth-assigned sex is such a sex-based stereotype.” \n2020 WL 5232076, *23 (emphasis added). Both are “[d]iscrimination based on transgender \nstatus—i.e., gender identity.” Id. \n213.  HHS is of the view that there is no meaningful distinction between the “gender \nidentity” provision and the “sex stereotyping” provision of the 2016 Rule, and that the \nFranciscan Alliance vacatur applied to both. See 85 Fed. Reg. at 37,236 (“[T]he sex stereotyping \nprovision [of the 2016 Rule] had no real-world effect after the [Franciscan Alliance] decision.”). \n214.  The EEOC is of the view that there is no meaningful distinction between \ndiscrimination based on “gender identity” and discrimination based on “sex stereotyping.” See \nAmicus Brief of EEOC in Support of Plaintiff, at 4, Robinson v. Dignity Health, 16-cv-03035 \nYGR (N.D. Cal.) (filed Aug. 22, 2016) (“[T]here is an inherent link between gender identity and \ngender-nonconformity. . . . A person is defined as transgender precisely because of the \nperception that his or her behavior transgresses gender stereotypes.” (quotations and citation \nomitted));13 Reply of EEOC to Def.’s Resp. to EEOC’s Amicus Brief, Robinson v. Dignity \nHealth, 16-cv-03035 YGR (N.D. Cal.) (filed Sep. 8, 2016) (stating that “discrimination against \ntransgender individuals is inherently a form of sex stereotyping”).14 \n215.  The Whitman-Walker Clinic injunction, which has nationwide scope, also \nprohibits “incorporation” into the 2020 Rule “of the religious exemption contained in Title IX.” \nId. at *45. The court suggested that “a blanket religious exemption” might “allow for \n \n13 Available at https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/eeoc/litigation/briefs/\nrobinson.html.   \n14 Available at https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/eeoc/litigation/briefs/\nrobinson2.html.  \n52 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 97   Filed 11/23/20   Page 53 of 86\ndiscrimination on the bases prohibited by Section 1557 or for the denial of health services to \nwomen.” Id. at *28 (quoting 81 Fed. Reg. at 31,379) (internal quotation marks omitted). \n216.  The Mandate imposed by the 2016 Rule is anchored in its definition of \ndiscrimination “on the basis of sex.” Under the injunctions issues in Walker and Whitman-\nWalker Clinic, that definition remains fully in effect and, accordingly, the Mandate remains fully \nin effect. Thus, Section 1557, as interpreted by HHS, continues to mandate that covered entities, \nincluding religious organizations, perform and cover gender-transition and abortion services. \n217.  Neither injunction affects the EEOC’s interpretation of Title VII, and the EEOC \nhas never backed off its interpretation that employers – even employers that are not covered \nentities under HHS’s rules – must cover gender-transition services in their health plans. \n218.  Accordingly, each and every one of this Second Amended Complaint’s \nallegations regarding the 2016 Rule and its effects on CBA and CMA members continue to \napply, notwithstanding HHS’s attempted repeal in the 2020 Rule. Even if the Walker and \nWhitman-Walker Clinic preliminary injunctions are without legal basis, as indeed they are, they \ncreate a legal state of affairs, or at least a state of significant legal uncertainty, that makes \nPlaintiffs’ need for declaratory and injunctive relief both critical and imminent. \n2.  Other pending legal challenges to the 2020 Rule \n219.  Other legal challenges to the 2020 Rule are pending. Plaintiffs in these cases are \nlikewise seeking to invalidate the 2020 Rule and its repeal of the “gender identity” and \n“termination of pregnancy” provisions of the 2016 Rule. These plaintiffs also seek to invalidate \nHHS’s effort to incorporate religious and abortion exemptions into the 2020 Rule. See BAGLY v. \nU.S. Dep’t of Health & Human Servs., No. 20-cv-11297, Compl., ECF No. 1, ¶¶ 231-32 (D. \nMass. July 9, 2020) (seeking to invalidate the 2020 Rule’s elimination of “gender identity” and \n“termination of pregnancy” from definition of sex discrimination, saying it will “embolden \n53 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 97   Filed 11/23/20   Page 54 of 86\ndiscrimination . . . on the basis of gender identity” and “embolden refusals of reproductive \nhealthcare.”); New York v. U.S. Dep’t of Health & Human Servs., No. 20-cv-05583, Compl., \nECF No. 1, ¶¶ 96, 234 (S.D.N.Y. July 20, 2020) (challenging “[t]he 2020 Rule’s removal of the \nmandate that covered entities treat transgender people consistent with their gender identity” and \nremoval of the abortion mandate because it will “further stigmatize abortion” and “embolden \nproviders to deny abortion care”); Washington v. U.S. Dep’t of Health & Human Servs., Compl., \nNo. 20-cv-01105, Compl., ECF No. 1, ¶ 1(W.D. Wash. July 16, 2020) (challenging the 2020 \nRule’s elimination of “sex stereotyping and gender identity from the definition of prohibited \n‘sex’ discrimination”). \nVII.  The Mandate burdens the religious exercise of the CBA and its members. \n220.  Although the Mandate applies directly only to “covered entities,” it impacts all \nCatholic employers.  \n221.  The decisions of CBA members to refuse to cooperate in their patients’, \nemployees’, or plan beneficiaries’ efforts to undergo gender transition procedures qualify as the \nexercise of religion. \n222.  The decisions of CBA members to refuse, for religious reasons, to cooperate in \ntheir patients’, employees’, or plan beneficiaries’ efforts to obtain an abortion qualify as the \nexercise of religion. \nA.  The Mandate’s effects on CBA members that are covered entities – medical \nservices \n223.  The Mandate’s regulatory scheme makes it virtually impossible for CBA \nmembers that qualify as a “covered entity” to continue their healthcare ministries. Their options \nare: (1) provide gender transition services, (2) cease providing any services that HHS may \ncorrelate with gender transition, (3) continue to meet patients’ needs but refuse to provide gender \n54 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 97   Filed 11/23/20   Page 55 of 86\ntransition services, (4) stop participating in all HHS-related programs, including Medicaid and \nMedicare; and (5) cease providing health services and activities.  \n224.  Option 1, directly providing gender transition and abortion services, is contrary to \nCatholic values and would give rise to scandal. Directly providing gender transition services is \ncontrary to Catholic values. This situation gives rise to scandal and the loss of members’ \nreputation because patients, employees, and the larger community would perceive that CBA-\nmember healthcare providers profess one thing but do another. Such scandal devastates ministry. \n225.  Option 2, ceasing providing any services that HHS may correlate with gender \ntransition and abortion, would be ruinous for covered entity CBA members and their patients. In \norder to avoid the Mandate, CBA members could refuse to perform any procedure that might be \nused as part of a gender transition, such as hysterectomies, mastectomies, hormone treatments, \nand plastic surgery. Doing so would prevent these CBA members from being able to use such \nprocedures to address medical illnesses or conditions—such as uterine cancer, breast cancer, \nmenopause, and miscarriage—thus injuring their healing ministries. Artificially restricting their \nmedical services in this manner would cause these CBA members to incur financial losses, lose \nvaluable employees, and suffer other injuries.  \n226.  Absent injunctive relief from this Court, option 3 is ruinous because it would \nexpose covered entity CBA members to HHS and EEOC enforcement actions and other penalties \nas described above.  \n227.  Option 4, stopping participation in HHS-related programs, including Medicaid \nand Medicare, would severely penalize CBA members for maintaining their religious \nconvictions. This would also require them to severely curtail their services to the poor, disabled, \nand the elderly, thus injuring their healing ministries. \n55 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 97   Filed 11/23/20   Page 56 of 86\n228.  Option 5, ceasing their health services and activities, would burden CBA \nmembers’ religious exercise.  \nB.  The Mandate’s effects on CBA members that are covered entities – insurance \ncoverage \n229.  The Mandate also affects covered entities’ ability to offer their employees health \nbenefits that reflect their Catholic values. Their options are: (1) provide a group health plan that \nincludes coverage for gender transition and abortion services, (2) provide a group health plan \nthat excludes coverage for gender transition and abortion services, or (3) cease providing health \ncoverage. \n230.  Option 1, providing a group health plan that covers gender transition and abortion \nservices, is contrary to Catholic values and would give rise to scandal. \n231.  Absent injunctive relief from this Court, option 2 is ruinous because it would \nexpose covered entity CBA members to HHS and EEOC enforcement actions and other penalties \nas described above.  \n232.  Option 3, dropping health benefits, would burden CBA members’ exercise of \nreligion because: (a) Catholic values commend providing just compensation and benefits \nsupportive of family values, including, whenever possible, health care; (b) eliminating health \ninsurance for employees subjects CBA members to annual excise taxes of $2,000 per employee \nafter the first 30 employees, 26 U.S.C. § 4980H(a), (c)(1); and (c) eliminating health insurance \nwould put CBA members at a significant disadvantage in the market for recruiting the best \nworkers and thereby harm the operation of their ministries.  \nC.  The Mandate’s effects on insured CBA members \n233.  The Mandate also injures CBA members who are not covered entities, and are \nthus not directly regulated by the 2016 Rule. Regardless of whether a CBA member is a covered \n56 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 97   Filed 11/23/20   Page 57 of 86\nentity, the Mandate restricts its ability to acquire a group health plan that reflects Catholic values. \nThis is because group insurers are covered entities that are required, under the 2016 Rule, to \ncover both transgender services and abortion.   \n234.  For CBA members that sponsor an insured group plan, their options are: (1) \nprovide a group health plan that includes coverage for gender transition and abortion services, \n(2) provide a group health plan that excludes coverage for gender transition and abortion \nservices, or (3) cease providing health coverage. \n235.  Option 1, providing a group health plan that covers gender transition and abortion \nservices is contrary to Catholic values and would give rise to scandal. \n236.  The Mandate has made option 2, providing a group health plan that excludes \ngender transition and abortion services, either impossible or unduly burdensome. Insured CBA \nmembers have been told by their insurers that, as a direct result of the 2016 Rule, their plans \nmust include gender-transition coverage. Insurers may also conclude that the 2016 Rule requires \nplans to include abortion coverage. Absent injunctive relief from this Court, even if a non-\ncovered entity CBA member were able to secure a morally compliant insured plan, option 2 is \nruinous because it would expose CBA members to EEOC enforcement actions and other \npenalties as described above. \n237.  Option 3, dropping health benefits, would burden CBA members’ exercise of \nreligion as described above. \nD.  Mandate’s effects on self-insured CBA members \n238.  The Mandate also injures CBA members who have a self-insured group health \nplan. For CBA members that sponsor a self-insured group health plan, their options are: (1) \nprovide a group health plan that includes coverage for gender transition services, (2) provide a \n57 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 97   Filed 11/23/20   Page 58 of 86\ngroup health plan that excludes coverage for gender transition services, or (3) cease providing \nhealth coverage. \n239.  Option 1, providing a group health plan that covers gender transition services, is \ncontrary to Catholic values and would give rise to scandal. \n240.  The Mandate has made option 2, providing a group health plan that excludes \ngender transition and abortion coverage, either impossible or unduly burdensome. Self-insured \nCBA members have been told by their TPAs that they will not administer a plan that \ncategorically excludes all gender transition coverage unless the CBA member agrees to \nindemnify the TPA or accept the TPA’s liability. TPAs may also find that the 2016 Rule compels \nthem to seek an indemnification agreement before excluding abortion coverage. Absent \ninjunctive relief from this Court, even if a non-covered entity CBA member were able to secure a \nmorally compliant self-insured plan, option 2 is ruinous because it would expose members to \nEEOC enforcement actions and other penalties as described above.  \n241.  Option 3, dropping healthcare benefits, would burden CBA members’ exercise of \nreligion as described above. \nVIII.  NEED FOR RELIEF \n242.  The Walker and Whitman-Walker Clinic injunctions prevent the 2020 Rule from \nbecoming operative and order that the 2016 Rule remains in effect. As a result, absent relief from \nthis Court, CBA members are presently subject to the Mandate and are required to perform, or \ninclude in their health plans, gender-transition and abortion services or else risk enforcement \nactions, civil lawsuits, and other penalties.  \n243.  Some insured CBA members have already been forced to cover transgender-\nrelated health services as a direct result of the Mandate, in contravention of their religious \nbeliefs. See Exs. E and F. \n58 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 97   Filed 11/23/20   Page 59 of 86\n244.  As a direct result of the Mandate, self-insured CBA members have been notified \nby their TPAs that they must indemnify their TPA or accept their TPA’s liability in order to \nmaintain their exclusion of all gender transition coverage.  \n245.  Absent relief from this Court, CBA members that are covered entities are \ncurrently threatened by the Mandate with administrative investigations, civil lawsuits, and \nvarious penalties if they continue to offer health services in a manner that reflect their Catholic \nconvictions.  \n246.  Absent relief from this Court, all CBA members are currently threatened by the \nMandate with administrative investigations, civil lawsuits, and various penalties if they continue \nto offer employee health benefits in a manner that reflects their Catholic convictions. \nIX.  CAUSES OF ACTION  \nCOUNT I  \n \nViolation of the Administrative Procedure Act  \nAgency Action Not in Accordance with Law \n247.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference all preceding paragraphs. \n248.  Defendants are “agencies” under the APA, 5 U.S.C. § 551(1), and the 2016 Rule, \nalong with the EEOC Statement complained of herein, constitute “rules” under the APA, id. § \n551(4), and constitute “[a]gency action made reviewable by statute and final agency action for \nwhich there is no other adequate remedy in a court,” id. § 704.  \n249.  The APA prohibits agency actions that are “not in accordance with law.” Id. § \n706(2)(A). The 2016 Rule and the EEOC Statement are not in accordance with law for a number \nof independent reasons. \n250.  The 2016 Rule will require physicians to perform gender transition procedures \nregardless of whether those procedures are “medically necessary” or “medically appropriate.” It \n59 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 97   Filed 11/23/20   Page 60 of 86\nis not in accordance with law for HHS to require medical professionals to perform procedures \nthat may not be necessary or appropriate, and may in fact be harmful to the patients.  \n251.  The 2016 Rule also states that a physician’s view of gender transition procedures \nas “experimental” is “outdated and not based on current standards of care.” 81 Fed. Reg. at \n31,435; see also id. at 31,429. It is not in accordance with law for HHS to dictate appropriate \nmedical views on the necessity and experimental nature of gender transition procedures, and to \ndictate what constitutes best standards of care in an area of science and medicine that is being \nhotly debated in the medical community. \n252.  The 2016 Rule is not in accordance with Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act \n(42 U.S.C. § 18116) or Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, 20 U.S.C. § 1681 et seq. \nNeither Section 1557 nor Title IX prohibits consideration of the real biological differences \nbetween the sexes in the context of healthcare and health coverage. HHS’s attempt to expand the \ndefinition is not in accordance with law within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \n253.  The EEOC Statement is not in accordance with Title VII. Title VII does not \nprohibit consideration of the real biological differences between the sexes in the context of \nhealthcare and health coverage. EEOC’s attempt to expand the definition is not in accordance \nwith law within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \n254.  HHS’s failure to include in the 2016 Rule a religious exemption that parallels the \nreligious exemption in Title IX is also not in accordance with law within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. \n§ 706(2)(A). \n255.  HHS’s failure to include an exclusion for sterilization and sterilization-related \nservices is not in accordance with law within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A) because it is \ninconsistent with the Church Amendments, 42 U.S.C. § 300a-7(b), which protect the right of \n60 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 97   Filed 11/23/20   Page 61 of 86\nhealthcare entities who receive federal funding to refuse to participate in or assist with \nsterilizations. \n256.  HHS’s failure to include an exclusion for abortion and abortion-related services is \nnot in accordance with law within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A) because it is inconsistent \nwith: (a) the plain language of Title IX, which prohibits requiring coverage, payment, or the use \nof facilities for abortion; (b) the Church Amendments, 42 U.S.C. §300a-7(b), which protect the \nright of healthcare entities who receive federal funding to refuse to participate in or assist with \nabortions; (c) Section 245 of the Public Health Service Act, 42 U.S.C. § 238(n), which prohibits \nthe federal government from discriminating against any healthcare entity on the basis that the \nentity refuses to perform abortions, provide referrals for abortions, or to make arrangements for \nsuch abortions; (d) the Weldon Amendment, which has been readopted or incorporated by \nreference in every HHS appropriations act since 2005, and provides that no funds may be made \navailable under HHS appropriations act to a government entity that discriminates against an \ninstitution or individual physician or healthcare professional on the basis that the entity or \nindividual “does not provide, pay for, provide coverage of, or refer for abortions”; and (e) \nSection 1303(b)(4) of the ACA, 42 U.S.C. § 18023(b)(4), which states that “[n]o qualified health \nplan offered through an Exchange may discriminate against any individual healthcare provider or \nhealthcare facility because of its unwillingness to provide, pay for, provide coverage of, or refer \nfor abortions.” \n257.  The 2016 Rule is not in accordance with Title VII, which requires CBA members \nto reasonably accommodate their employees’ religious practices, because the 2016 Rule will \nmake it illegal for CBA members who receive HHS funds to accommodate their employees’ \nreligious objections to providing gender transition procedures.  \n61 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 97   Filed 11/23/20   Page 62 of 86\n258.  The 2016 Rule also forces physicians to provide medical services related to \ngender transition. This is not in accordance with substantive due process rights protecting a \nmedical professional’s right to not perform a procedure he or she believes to be experimental, \nethically questionable, and potentially harmful.  \n259.  The 2016 Rule is not in accordance with law because it violates the First \nAmendment, Fifth Amendment, and the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, as hereafter \ndescribed.  \n260.  Plaintiffs have no adequate or available administrative remedy, or, in the \nalternative, any effort to obtain an administrative remedy would be futile. \n261.  Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law. \n262.  Absent injunctive and declaratory relief against the Mandate, Plaintiffs have been \nand will continue to be harmed. \nCOUNT II  \n \nViolation of the Administrative Procedure Act \nAgency Action In Excess of Statutory Authority and Limitations \n263.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference all preceding paragraphs. \n264.  The APA prohibits agency actions that are “in excess of statutory jurisdiction, \nauthority, or limitations.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(C). The 2016 Rule and the EEOC Statement are in \nexcess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, and limitations for a number of reasons. \n265.  For the reasons described above, there is no statutory authority or jurisdiction for \nHHS to require medical professionals and facilities to perform procedures (or refer for the same) \nthat may not be necessary or appropriate, and may in fact be harmful to the patients. \n266.  For the reasons described above, there is no statutory authority or jurisdiction for \nHHS to dictate appropriate medical views on the necessity and experimental nature of gender \n62 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 97   Filed 11/23/20   Page 63 of 86\ntransition procedures, or to dictate what constitutes best standards of care in an area of science \nand medicine that is being hotly debated in the medical community. \n267.  For the reasons described above, HHS’s decision to interpret Section 1557 to ban \n“gender identity” discrimination in the context of healthcare and health coverage is in excess of \nstatutory jurisdiction, authority, and limitations within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(C). \n268.  For the reasons described above, EEOC’s decision to interpret Title VII to ban \n“gender identity” discrimination in the context of healthcare and health coverage is in excess of \nstatutory jurisdiction, authority, and limitations within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(C). \n269.  For the reasons described above, HHS’s failure to include a religious exemption \nin the 2016 Rule that parallels the religious exemption in Title IX is in excess of statutory \njurisdiction, authority, and limitations within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(C). \n270.  For the reasons discussed above, HHS’s failure to include an exclusion for \nsterilization and sterilization-related services is in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, and \nlimitations within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(C) because it is inconsistent with the Church \nAmendments, 42 U.S.C. § 300a-7(b). \n271.  For the reasons discussed above, HHS’s failure to include an exclusion for \nabortion and abortion-related services is in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, and \nlimitations within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(C) because it is inconsistent with: (a) the \nplain language of Title IX, which prohibits requiring coverage, payment, or the use of facilities \nfor abortion; (b) the Church Amendments, 42 U.S.C. § 300a-7(b); (c) Section 245 of the Public \nHealth Service Act, 42 U.S.C. § 238(n); (d) the Weldon Amendment, which has been readopted \nor incorporated by reference in every HHS appropriations act since 2005; and (e) Section \n1303(b)(4) of the ACA, 42 U.S.C. § 18023. \n63 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 97   Filed 11/23/20   Page 64 of 86\n272.  For the reasons described above, HHS’s decision to require CBA members to act \nin violation of Title VII by not accommodating their employees’ religious and conscientious \nobjections to participating in (or referring for) gender transition treatment or procedures is in \nexcess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, and limitations within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. § \n706(2)(C). \n273.  For the reasons discussed above, the 2016 Rule is in excess of statutory \njurisdiction, authority, and limitations within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(C) as it violates \nthe First Amendment, Fifth Amendment, and the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, as \nhereafter described. \n274.  Plaintiffs have no adequate or available administrative remedy, or, in the \nalternative, any effort to obtain an administrative remedy would be futile. \n275.  Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law. \n276.  Absent injunctive and declaratory relief against the Mandate, Plaintiffs have been \nand will continue to be harmed. \nCOUNT III  \n \nViolation of the Administrative Procedure Act \nAgency Action that is Arbitrary, Capricious and an Abuse of Discretion \n277.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference all preceding paragraphs. \n278.  The APA prohibits agency actions that are “arbitrary, capricious, [or] an abuse of \ndiscretion.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). The 2016 Rule is arbitrary and capricious agency action for a \nnumber of reasons. \n279.  For the reasons described above, it is arbitrary and capricious for HHS to require \nmedical professionals to perform (or refer for) procedures that the physician believes may not be \nnecessary or appropriate, and that may even be harmful to the patient. \n64 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 97   Filed 11/23/20   Page 65 of 86\n280.  For the reasons discussed above, it is arbitrary and capricious for HHS to dictate \nappropriate medical views on the necessity and experimental nature of gender transition \nprocedures, and to dictate what constitutes best standards of care. \n281.  For the reasons discussed above, HHS’s prohibition on “gender identity” \ndiscrimination in the context of healthcare and health coverage is an arbitrary and capricious \ninterpretation of Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act (42 U.S.C. § 18116) and Title IX of \nthe Education Amendments of 1972, 20 U.S.C. § 1681 et seq. \n282.  For the reasons discussed above, EEOC’s prohibition on “gender identity” \ndiscrimination in the context of healthcare and health coverage is an arbitrary and capricious \ninterpretation of Title VII.  \n283.  For the reasons discussed above, HHS’s failure to include a religious exemption \nin the 2016 Rule that parallels the religious exemption in Title IX is arbitrary and capricious \nwithin the meaning of 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \n284.  For the reasons discussed above, HHS’s failure to include an exclusion for \nsterilization and sterilization-related services is arbitrary and capricious within the meaning of 5 \nU.S.C. § 706(2)(A) because it is inconsistent with the Church Amendments, 42 U.S.C. § 300a-\n7(b). \n285.  For the reasons discussed above, HHS’s failure to include an exclusion for \nabortion and abortion-related services is arbitrary and capricious within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. \n§ 706(2)(A). \n286.  For the reasons described above, HHS’s decision to require Plaintiffs to act in \nviolation of Title VII by not accommodating their employees’ religious objections to \n65 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 97   Filed 11/23/20   Page 66 of 86\nparticipating in gender transition procedures is arbitrary and capricious within the meaning of 5 \nU.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \n287.  For the reasons discussed above, the 2016 Rule is arbitrary and capricious within \nthe meaning of 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A) as it violates the First Amendment, Fifth Amendment, and \nReligious Freedom Restoration Act as hereafter described. \n288.  Plaintiffs have no adequate or available administrative remedy, or, in the \nalternative, any effort to obtain an administrative remedy would be futile. \n289.  Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law. \n290.  Absent injunctive and declaratory relief against the 2016 Rule, Plaintiffs have \nbeen and will continue to be harmed. \nCOUNT IV \n \nViolation of the First Amendment of the United States Constitution \nFreedom of Speech \nCompelled Speech and Compelled Silence \n291.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference all preceding paragraphs. \n292.  CBA members plan to continue using their best medical and ethical judgment in \ntreating and advising patients. Performing (or referring for) gender transition procedures is \ncontrary to their best medical and/or ethical judgment. \n293.  The 2016 Rule states, in the context of physicians offering “health services” that a \n“categorization of all transition-related treatment . . . as experimental, is outdated and not based \non current standards of care.” 81 Fed. Reg. at 31,435; see also id. at 31,429. \n294.  The 2016 Rule prohibits CBA members from expressing their professional \nopinions that gender transition procedures are not the best standard of care or are experimental. \n295.  The 2016 Rule also requires CBA members to amend their written policies to \nexpressly endorse gender transition procedures, even if such revisions do not reflect the medical \n66 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 97   Filed 11/23/20   Page 67 of 86\njudgment, values, or beliefs of CBA members. Id. at 31455. The 2016 Rule also requires CBA \nmembers to use gender-transition affirming language in all situations, regardless of \ncircumstance. Id. at 31406. \n296.  Performing (or referring for) gender transition procedures is also contrary to the \nreligious and conscientious beliefs of CBA members, and their beliefs prohibit them from \nconducting, participating in, or referring for such procedures. \n297.  The 2016 Rule compels CBA members to conduct, participate in, refer for, or \notherwise facilitate gender transition procedures. \n298.  The 2016 Rule prohibits CBA members from expressing their religious views that \ngender transition procedures are not the best standard of care or are experimental. \n299.  The 2016 Rule compels CBA members to speak in ways that they would not \notherwise speak. \n300.  The 2016 Rule thus violates CBA members’ right to be free from compelled \nspeech as secured to them by the First Amendment of the United States Constitution. \n301.  The 2016 Rule’s compelled speech requirement is not justified by a compelling \ngovernmental interest. \n302.  Even if HHS has a compelling government interest, the 2016 Rule is not narrowly \ntailored to achieve that interest. \n303.  Absent injunctive and declaratory relief against the 2016 Rule, the CBA and its \nmembers have been and will continue to be harmed. \nCOUNT V \n \nViolation of the First Amendment of the United States Constitution  \nFreedom of Speech and Free Exercise Clause \nViewpoint Discrimination \n304.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference all preceding paragraphs. \n67 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 97   Filed 11/23/20   Page 68 of 86\n305.  CBA members’ sincere religious and conscientious beliefs prohibit them from \nfacilitating or participating in gender transition procedures. \n306.  CBA members’ medical judgment is that it is harmful and unethical to encourage \na patient to undergo gender transition procedures. \n307.  The 2016 Rule states, in the context of physicians offering “health services” that a \n“categorization of all transition-related treatment, for example as experimental, is outdated and \nnot based on current standards of care.” 81 Fed. Reg. at 31,435; see also id. at 31,429. \n308.  The 2016 Rule would prohibit CBA members from expressing their religious or \nconscientious viewpoint that gender transition procedures are not the best standard of care. \n309.  The 2016 Rule withholds funding based on an intent to restrict CBA members’ \nspeech. \n310.  The 2016 Rule’s viewpoint discrimination is not justified by a compelling \ngovernmental interest. \n311.  Even if HHS has a compelling government interest, the 2016 Rule is not narrowly \ntailored to achieve that interest. \n312.  Defendants’ actions thus violate CBA members’ rights as secured to them by the \nFirst Amendment of the United States Constitution. \n313.  Absent injunctive and declaratory relief against the 2016 Rule, the CBA and its \nmembers have been and will continue to be harmed. \nCOUNT VI  \n \nViolation of the First and Fifth Amendments of the United States  \nConstitution  \nFreedom of Speech and Due Process  \nOverbreadth \n314.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference all preceding paragraphs. \n68 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 97   Filed 11/23/20   Page 69 of 86\n315.  The 2016 Rule regulates protected speech. The 2016 Rule states, in the context of \nphysicians offering “health services” that a “categorization of all transition-related treatment . . . \nas experimental, is outdated and not based on current standards of care.” 81 Fed. Reg. at 31,435; \nsee also id. at 31,429. \n316.  This exposes CBA members to penalties for expressing their medical and moral \nviews of gender transition procedures. It also prohibits CBA members from using their medical \njudgment to determine the appropriate standard of care for interactions with their patients. \n317.  CBA members believe that the 2016 Rule restricts their speech regarding the best \nstandard of care for patients. \n318.  The 2016 Rule states: “The determination of whether a certain practice is \ndiscriminatory typically requires a nuanced analysis that is fact-dependent.” Id. at 31,377. \n319.  The 2016 Rule chills CBA members’ speech. \n320.  The 2016 Rule’s overbreadth is not justified by a compelling governmental \ninterest. \n321.  Even if HHS has a compelling government interest, the 2016 Rule is not narrowly \ntailored to achieve that interest. \n322.  Defendants have therefore violated CBA members’ rights secured to them by the \nFree Speech Clause of the First Amendment and the Due Process Clause of the Fifth \nAmendment by prohibiting speech that would otherwise be protected.  \n323.  Absent injunctive and declaratory relief against the 2016 Rule, the CBA and its \nmembers have been and will continue to be harmed. \n69 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 97   Filed 11/23/20   Page 70 of 86\nCOUNT VII  \n \nViolation of the First and Fifth Amendments of the United States  \nConstitution  \nFreedom of Speech and Due Process  \nVoid for Vagueness \n324.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference all preceding paragraphs. \n325.  The 2016 Rule requires that a covered entity apply “neutral, nondiscriminatory \ncriteria that it uses for other conditions when the coverage determination is related to gender \ntransition” and “decline[s] to limit application of the rule by specifying that coverage for the \nhealth services addressed in § 92.207(b)(3)-(5) must be provided only when the services are \nmedically necessary or medically appropriate.” 81 Fed. Reg. at 31,435. \n326.  Without allowing CBA members to use their judgment about what is medically \nnecessary or appropriate, the 2016 Rule is ambiguous in the types of services CBA members are \nrequired to provide and perform. \n327.  Requiring a CBA member to apply “neutral, nondiscriminatory criteria that it uses \nfor other conditions” is a subjective standard without a limiting construction. Id. \n328.  The 2016 Rule states, in the context of physicians offering “health services” that a \n“categorization of all transition-related treatment, for example as experimental, is outdated and \nnot based on current standards of care.” Id.; see also id. at 31,429. \n329.  The 2016 Rule does not provide a limiting construction for what the current \nstandard of care is, nor does it provide guidance as to how physicians can rely on their best \nmedical judgment when it conflicts with the 2016 Rule. \n330.  The 2016 Rule is not justified by a compelling governmental interest. \n331.  Even if HHS has a compelling government interest, the 2016 Rule is not narrowly \ntailored to achieve that interest. \n70 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 97   Filed 11/23/20   Page 71 of 86\n332.  Because CBA members are unable to determine what kind of procedures and \nservices they will be required to provide and perform, Defendants have violated CBA members’ \nrights secured to them by the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment and the Due Process \nClause of the Fifth Amendment. \n333.  Absent injunctive and declaratory relief against the 2016 Rule, the CBA and its \nmembers have been and will continue to be harmed. \nCOUNT VIII  \n \nViolation of the First Amendment of the United States Constitution \nFree Exercise Clause and Freedom of Speech \nUnbridled Discretion \n334.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference all preceding paragraphs. \n335.  The 2016 Rule “applies to every health program or activity, any part of which \nreceives Federal financial assistance provided or made available by the Department; every health \nprogram or activity administered by the Department; and every health program or activity \nadministered by a Title I entity.” 45 C.F.R. 92.2(a). \n336.  The 2016 Rule also states: “The determination of whether a certain practice is \ndiscriminatory typically requires a nuanced analysis that is fact-dependent.” 81 Fed. Reg. at \n31,377. \n337.  The 2016 Rule also says: “Insofar as the application of any requirement under this \npart would violate applicable Federal statutory protections for religious freedom and conscience, \nsuch application shall not be required.” 45 C.F.R. 92.2(b)(2). \n338.  Because the Defendants have sole discretion over financial assistance provided or \nmade available, and because Defendants have sole discretion over the application of the 2016 \nRule and any religious freedom protection that applies, the 2016 Rule vests unbridled discretion \nover which organizations will have their First Amendment interests accommodated. \n71 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 97   Filed 11/23/20   Page 72 of 86\n339.  In Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, Congress precluded \ndiscrimination on the basis of “sex” in federally funded education programs, “except that . . . this \nsection shall not apply to an educational institution which is controlled by a religious \norganization if the application of this subsection would not be consistent with the religious tenets \nof such organization.” 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a)-(a)(3). Defendants have exercised unbridled \ndiscretion by declining to apply the clear religious freedom protections of Title IX. \n340.  In Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, Congress banned sex \ndiscrimination in federally funded education programs, except that it made clear that “[n]othing \nin this chapter shall be construed to require or prohibit any person, or public or private entity, to \nprovide or pay for any benefit or service, including the use of facilities, related to an abortion. \nNothing in this section shall be construed to permit a penalty to be imposed on any person or \nindividual because such person or individual is seeking or has received any benefit or service \nrelated to a legal abortion.” 20 U.S.C. § 1688. Defendants have exercised unbridled discretion by \ndeclining to apply the clear abortion protections of Title IX. \n341.  Defendants’ actions therefore violate CBA members’ rights not to be subjected to \na system of unbridled discretion when engaging in speech or when engaging in religious \nexercise, as secured to them by the First Amendment of the United States Constitution. \n342.  Absent injunctive and declaratory relief against the 2016 Rule, the CBA and its \nmembers have been and will continue to be harmed. \nCOUNT IX \n \nViolation of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution \nFree Speech Clause \nUnconstitutional Conditions \n343.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference all preceding paragraphs. \n72 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 97   Filed 11/23/20   Page 73 of 86\n344.  The 2016 Rule imposes an unconstitutional condition on Plaintiffs’ receipt of \nfederal funding.  \n345.  The 2016 Rule applies to any healthcare provider who accepts federal funding \nfrom any source for any program. \n346.  The 2016 Rule requires CBA members to adopt policies regarding standards of \ncare for patients that violate Plaintiffs’ religious and conscientious beliefs, as well as their \nmedical judgment, and also interfere with CBA members’ practice of medicine. \n347.  Defendants’ actions therefore impose an unconstitutional condition on CBA \nmembers’ receipt of federal funding and violate Plaintiffs’ rights as secured to them by the First \nand Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution. \n348.  Absent injunctive and declaratory relief against the 2016 Rule, the CBA and its \nmembers have been and will continue to be harmed. \nCOUNT X  \n \nViolation of the First Amendment  \nFreedom of Speech \nExpressive Association \n349.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference all preceding paragraphs. \n350.  CBA members believe and teach that participating in actions, procedures, and \nservices with the goal of transitioning from one sex to another violate their religious beliefs. \n351.  CBA members believe and teach that participating in actions, procedures, and \nservices that result in elective sterilizations violate their religious beliefs. \n352.  CBA members believe and teach that participating in actions, procedures, and \nservices related to abortion violate their religious beliefs. \n353.  The Mandate compels CBA members to participate in procedures, services, and \nactivities that contradict their religious beliefs and message. \n73 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 97   Filed 11/23/20   Page 74 of 86\n354.  The Mandate compels CBA members to offer health coverage for procedures, \nservices, and activities that violate their religious beliefs and message. \n355.  Defendants’ actions thus violate CBA members’ rights of expressive association \nas secured to them by the First Amendment of the United States Constitution. \n356.  Absent injunctive and declaratory relief against the Mandate, the CBA and its \nmembers have been and will continue to be harmed. \n357.  The Mandate exposes CBA members to civil suits that would hold them liable for \npracticing and expressing their sincerely held religious beliefs. \n358.  The Mandate furthers no compelling governmental interest. \n359.  The Mandate is not the least restrictive means of furthering Defendants’ stated \ninterests. \nCOUNT XI \n \nViolation of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act  \nCompelled Medical Services \n360.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference all preceding paragraphs. \n361.  CBA members’ sincerely held religious beliefs prohibit them from deliberately \noffering services and performing (or referring for) operations or other procedures required by the \n2016 Rule. CBA members’ compliance with these beliefs is a religious exercise. \n362.  CBA members sincerely held religious beliefs prohibit them facilitating gender \ntransition procedures. CBA members’ compliance with these beliefs is a religious exercise. \n363.  CBA members’ sincerely held religious beliefs prohibit them facilitating \nsterilization procedures. CBA members’ compliance with these beliefs is a religious exercise. \n364.  CBA members’ sincerely held religious beliefs prohibit them facilitating abortion-\nrelated services. CBA members’ compliance with these beliefs is a religious exercise. \n74 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 97   Filed 11/23/20   Page 75 of 86\n365.  The Mandate creates government-imposed coercive pressure on CBA members to \nchange or violate their religious beliefs. \n366.  The Mandate chills CBA members’ religious exercise. \n367.  The Mandate exposes CBA members to the loss of substantial government \nfunding as a result of their religious exercise. \n368.  The Mandate exposes CBA members to substantial penalties under the False \nClaims Act, 31 U.S.C. § 3729 et seq. \n369.  The Mandate exposes CBA members to criminal penalties under 18 U.S.C. § \n1035. \n370.  The Mandate exposes CBA members to civil suits that would hold them liable for \npracticing their sincerely held religious beliefs. \n371.  The Mandate thus imposes a substantial burden on the CBA’s and its members’ \nreligious exercise. \n372.  The Mandate furthers no compelling governmental interest. \n373.  The Mandate is not the least restrictive means of furthering Defendants’ stated \ninterests. \n374.  The Mandate violates the CBA’s and its members’ rights secured to them by the \nReligious Freedom Restoration Act, 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb et seq. \nCOUNT XII  \n \nViolation of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act  \nCompelled Insurance Coverage \n \n375.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference all preceding paragraphs. \n75 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 97   Filed 11/23/20   Page 76 of 86\n376.  For the same reasons discussed above, CBA members’ sincerely held religious \nbeliefs prohibit them from deliberately offering health insurance that would cover services \nrelated to gender transition, sterilization, and abortion. \n377.  CBA members specifically exclude coverage of any services related to gender \ntransition and abortion in their group health plans. \n378.  CBA members’ compliance with these beliefs by maintaining these exclusions is \na religious exercise. \n379.  Under the Mandate, insurance exclusions related to gender transition, sterilization, \nand abortion services, are facially invalid. \n380.  The Mandate exposes CBA members to the loss of substantial government \nfunding as a result of their religious exercise. \n381.  The Mandate also makes it more expensive for CBA members to do business with \na third party administrator for a health benefits plan. The Mandate subjects third party \nadministrators to potential liability for administering plans that reflect Catholic teachings by \ncategorically excluding gender transition and abortion services, and thus CBA members will be \nforced to indemnify, or accept liability for, any TPA. This constitutes an additional substantial \nburden on the CBA’s and its members’ religious exercise. \n382.  The Mandate exposes CBA members to substantial penalties under the False \nClaims Act, 31 U.S.C. § 3729 et seq. \n383.  The Mandate exposes CBA members to criminal penalties under 18 U.S.C. § \n1035. \n384.  The Mandate exposes CBA members to civil suits that would hold them liable for \npracticing their sincerely held religious beliefs. \n76 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 97   Filed 11/23/20   Page 77 of 86\n385.  The Mandate thus imposes a substantial burden on the CBA’s and its members’ \nreligious exercise. \n386.  The Mandate furthers no compelling governmental interest. \n387.  The Mandate is not the least restrictive means of furthering Defendants’ stated \ninterests. \n388.  The Mandate violates the CBA’s and its members’ rights secured to them by the \nReligious Freedom Restoration Act, 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb et seq. \nCOUNT XIII  \n \nViolation of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution  \nFree Exercise Clause \n \n389.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference all preceding paragraphs. \n390.  CBA members object to providing, facilitating, covering, or otherwise \nparticipating in gender transition procedures. \n391.  The Mandate imposes substantial burdens on CBA members by forcing them to \nchoose between their exercise of religion and the avoidance of fines, penalties, liability, and \nother adverse consequences. \n392.  The Mandate seeks to suppress the religious practice of individuals and \norganizations such as CBA members, while allowing exemptions for similar conduct based on \nsecular and non-religious reasons. Thus, the Mandate is neither neutral nor generally applicable. \n393.  None of the statutes pursuant to which the Mandate is promulgated is generally \napplicable. Section 1557, Title IX, and Title VII are not generally applicable. For example, Title \nVII is not generally applicable because it exempts or does not cover employers that employ \nfewer than 15 employees and, as a result, does not apply to millions of employers that together \nemploy hundreds of millions of people.  \n77 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 97   Filed 11/23/20   Page 78 of 86\n394.  The Mandate is not justified by a compelling governmental interest. \n395.  Even if the Mandate is justified by a compelling government interest, it is not the \nleast restrictive means of achieving that interest. \n396.  Defendants’ actions thus violate the CBA’s and its members’ rights secured to \nthem by the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment of the United States Constitution. \n397.  Absent injunctive and declaratory relief against the Mandate, the CBA and its \nmembers have been and will continue to be harmed. \nCOUNT XIV \n \nViolation of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution \nDue Process Clause \nSubstantive Due Process \n398.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference all preceding paragraphs. \n399.  The United States has a deeply rooted tradition of honoring physicians’ and \nhealthcare institutions’ rights to provide medical treatment in accordance with their moral and \nreligious beliefs. \n400.  CBA members possess a fundamental right of liberty of conscience. \n401.  CBA members possess a fundamental right not to be coerced to provide medical \nprocedures and services in violation of their conscience. \n402.  The Mandate coerces CBA members to provide medical services and coverage in \nviolation of their conscience. \n403.  Defendants’ conduct cannot be justified by a compelling governmental interest. \n404.  The Mandate is not justified by a compelling governmental interest. \n405.  Even if Defendants have a compelling government interest, the Mandate is not \nnarrowly tailored to achieve that interest. \n78 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 97   Filed 11/23/20   Page 79 of 86\n406.  Defendants’ actions therefore violate CBA members’ rights to substantive due \nprocess. \n407.  Absent injunctive and declaratory relief against the Mandate, the CBA and its \nmembers have been and will continue to be harmed. \nCOUNT XV \n \nViolation of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution  \nDue Process and Equal Protection \n \n408.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference all preceding paragraphs. \n409.  The Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment mandates the equal treatment of \nall religious faiths and institutions without discrimination or preference. \n410.  The Mandate discriminates on the basis of religious views or religious status by \nrefusing to recognize religious exemptions that exist in the law. \n411.  The Mandate discriminates on the basis of religious views or religious status by \nrefusing to recognize valid medical views of religious healthcare professionals on gender \ntransition procedures. \n412.  The Defendants’ actions thus violate Plaintiffs’ rights secured to them by the Fifth \nAmendment of the United States Constitution. \n413.  Absent injunctive and declaratory relief against the Mandate, the CBA and the \nCMA and their respective members have been and will continue to be harmed. \nX.  PRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWherefore Plaintiffs request that the Court: \n \nA.  Declare that neither the Affordable Care Act, Title IX, nor Title VII, nor any regulations \nor other executive actions promulgated thereunder, shall infringe on the CBA’s and its \nmembers’ right and power to request, design, contract for, adopt, and implement health \n79 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 97   Filed 11/23/20   Page 80 of 86\nplans and insurance policies that exclude coverage of health services for gender transition \nand abortion consistent with their medical judgment and sincerely held religious beliefs. \nB.

Declare that the Mandate and Defendants’ enforcement of the Mandate against the CBA \nand its members violate the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, and that no taxes, \npenalties, or other burdens can be charged or assessed against the CBA and its members \nfor failure to pay for, provide, or directly or indirectly facilitate access to abortion or \ngender transition services.  \nD.

Declare that Defendants may not apply or enforce the Mandate against the insurers and \nTPAs of the CBA and its members; may not interfere with members’ attempts to arrange \nor contract for morally compliant health coverage or related services for their employees; \nand that no taxes, penalties, or other burdens can be charged or assessed against such \ninsurers or TPAs in relation to their work for the CBA and its members; \nF.

No. 3:16-cv-386 \nALEX M. AZAR, Secretary of the United \nStates Department of Health and Human \nService, et al., \n \nDefendants. \nCATHOLIC BENEFITS ASSOCIATION, \net al. \nPlaintiffs, \nv.  No. 3:16-cv-432 \nALEX M AZAR, Secretary of the United   \nStates Department of Health and Human \nService, et al., \n \nDefendants. \nPLAINTIFFS’ UNOPPOSED MOTION TO LIFT STAY \nPlaintiffs in these consolidated cases ask the Court to lift the stay of this litigation and set an \nagreed schedule for filing and responding to amended complaints. Defendants consent to the relief \nrequested by Plaintiffs. \nI.  Background \nPlaintiffs consist of certain religious healthcare providers, insurers, and organizations, as well \nas the State of North Dakota. Plaintiffs filed these cases in late 2016, following the issuance of a \n2016 Rule by Defendant the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) under the \n1 \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 92   Filed 11/06/20   Page 2 of 8\nPatient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA). Nondiscrimination in Health Programs and \nActivities, 81 Fed. Reg. 31,376 (May 18, 2016); see ECF Nos. 1, 37. The 2016 Rule interpreted \nthe ACA’s prohibition on “sex” discrimination to include discrimination on the basis of “gender \nidentity”  and  “termination  of  pregnancy.”  81  Fed.  Reg.  at  31,467.  Plaintiffs  alleged  that \nDefendants’ interpretation of the ACA would require them to perform and provide insurance \ncoverage for gender transitions and abortions in contravention of their religious beliefs and medical \njudgment, and that Defendants’ actions therefore violated the Religious Freedom Restoration Act \n(RFRA),  the  First,  Fifth,  Tenth,  and Eleventh Amendments,  the  Spending  Clause,  and  the \nAdministrative Procedure Act (APA). (Plaintiffs in No. 3:16-cv-432 also alleged that Defendant \nEEOC’s interpretation and enforcement of Title VII was illegal for similar reasons.) \nOn December 30, 2016, this Court issued an order staying enforcement of the 2016 Rule \nagainst Plaintiffs. ECF No. 23. On January 23, 2017, the Court amended its December 30 order \n“to make clear that it temporarily stays enforcement, as to the named Plaintiffs, of Section 1557’s \nprohibitions against discrimination on the bases of gender identity and termination of pregnancy.” \nECF No. 36. The Court noted that on December 31, 2016, another federal district court in Texas \nhad issued a nationwide preliminary injunction prohibiting HHS from enforcing the 2016 Rule. Id. \nat 1; Franciscan Alliance v. Burwell, No. 16-cv-108, 2016 WL 7638311 (N.D. Tex. Dec. 31, 2016). \nThis Court found “the order issued in Franciscan Alliance to be thorough and well-reasoned.” \nECF No. 36 at 2. \nOn May 26, 2017, Defendants filed a motion for voluntary remand and stay. ECF No. 45. \nDefendants requested “the opportunity to reconsider the regulation at issue . . . based in part on the \nAdministration’s desire to assess the reasonableness, necessity, and efficacy” of the 2016 Rule and \n“to address certain issues identified by [the Franciscan Alliance] federal district court in granting \na preliminary injunction against those aspects of the regulation.” Id. at 1. The parties then \nsubmitted briefs concerning the propriety of a stay or remand. ECF Nos. 46, 50, 51, 52, 53. \nOn August 24, 2017, the Court granted Defendants’ motion for a stay and denied the motion \nfor remand. ECF No. 56. The Court held that “a stay is warranted AND appropriate so that the \n2 \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 92   Filed 11/06/20   Page 3 of 8\nagency can revisit Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act.” Id. at 2. The Court also held that the \nconsolidated cases would “be stayed in all respects until further Order of the Court in order to \nallow HHS to reconsider the controversial rules and regulations at issue.” Id.  \nDefendants obtained a similar stay in Franciscan Alliance. In December 2018, however, the \nFranciscan Alliance parties jointly moved to lift the stay, which the Court granted. Franciscan \nAlliance,  No.  16-cv-108,  ECF  No.  126 (N.D. Tex.  Dec.  17,  2018).  In  February  2019,  the \nFranciscan Alliance plaintiffs sought summary judgment on their RFRA and APA claims. Id., \nECF No. 135 (N.D. Tex. filed Feb. 4, 2019).  \nIn May 2019—while the Franciscan Alliance summary-judgment motions were pending—\nHHS issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to amend the 2016 Rule. ECF No. 71-1. Citing the \nFranciscan Alliance court’s preliminary-injunction decision, the proposed rule stated that the \nRule’s definition of “sex” “exceeded [HHS’s] authority under Section 1557.” Id. at 15. The \nproposed rule sought to address this issue by repealing the 2016 Rule’s definition of “sex” in its \nentirety, which, HHS said, would “allow the Federal courts, in particular, the U.S. Supreme Court \n. . . to resolve any dispute about the proper legal interpretation of” “sex” in Section 1557. Id. at \n112-13. As the proposed rule noted, the Supreme Court had recently granted certiorari to decide \nwhether “sex” discrimination under Title VII included discrimination on the basis of “sexual \norientation” and “gender identity,” in three cases that would later be decided together as Bostock \nv. Clayton County, 140 S. Ct. 1731 (2020). Id. at 40-41. \nIn October 2019, the Franciscan Alliance district court granted summary judgment for the \nplaintiffs. Franciscan Alliance, Inc. v. Azar, 414 F. Supp. 3d 928 (N.D. Tex. 2019). The court \nfound “no reason to depart from its” preliminary-injunction analysis on the merits, concluding that \nthe 2016 Rule violated both RFRA and the APA. Id. at 942. It concluded, however, that the proper \nremedy was vacatur of “the unlawful portions of” the 2016 Rule, “not a permanent injunction.” Id. \nat 944-45; see Franciscan, No. 16-cv-108, ECF No. 182 (N.D. Tex. Nov. 21, 2019) (clarifying \nthat the 2016 Rule was vacated “insofar as [it] defines ‘On the basis of sex’ to include gender \nidentity and termination of pregnancy”). HHS did not appeal the court’s ruling on the merits; \n3 \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 92   Filed 11/06/20   Page 4 of 8\nPlaintiffs, however, appealed the denial of injunctive relief to the Fifth Circuit, where briefing on \nthe appropriate form of relief is currently underway. \nOn June 12, 2020, HHS issued a new Section 1557 rule, finalizing the rule proposed in 2019. \nSee Nondiscrimination in Health and Health Education Programs or Activities (the 2020 Rule), 85 \nFed. Reg. 37,160 (June 19, 2020). The 2020 Rule declined to replace the 2016 Rule’s definition \nof “sex” with a new definition, reasoning instead that the Supreme Court’s then-forthcoming \ndecision in Bostock would “likely have ramifications for the definition of ‘on the basis of sex’ \nunder  Title  IX.”  Id.  at  37,168.  Thus,  simply  repealing  the  prior  definition  would  permit \n“application of the [Bostock] Court’s construction.” Id. \nHHS also stated that the 2020 Rule was intended to respond to the fact that “the Franciscan \nAlliance court vacated portions of the 2016 Rule for failing to incorporate Title IX’s exemption \nfor religious institutions.” Id. at 37,207. To that end, the 2020 Rule included language stating that \n“[i]nsofar as the application of any requirement under this part would violate, depart from, or \ncontradict . . . exemptions . . . provided by any of” certain other statutes, including Title IX, “such \napplication shall not be imposed or required.” 45 C.F.R. § 92.6(b). HHS acknowledged, however, \nthat the 2020 Rule did not itself include “a religious exemption, whether narrow or broad,” nor did \nit “purport to construe the” exemptions referenced. 85 Fed. Reg. at 37,205. \nThree days later, on June 15, 2020, the Supreme Court decided Bostock. 140 S. Ct. 1731 \n(2020). The Court held that when “an employer . . . fires someone simply for being homosexual \nor  transgender,”  the  employer  has  “discriminated  against  that  individual  ‘because  of  such \nindividual’s sex’” within the meaning of Title VII. Id. at 1753. The Court cautioned, however, that \nits opinion did not “prejudge” the proper interpretation of “other federal or state laws that prohibit \nsex discrimination,” id., including Section 1557 and Title IX, see id. at 1779-82 & n.57 (Alito, J., \ndissenting). Indeed, the Bostock Court explained it was “deeply concerned with preserving the \npromise of the free exercise of religion,” and that religious employers might not be liable under \nTitle  VII  “in  cases  like  ours”  if  complying  would  require  them  “to  violate  their  religious \nconvictions.” Id. at 1753-54 (majority opinion). \n4 \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 92   Filed 11/06/20   Page 5 of 8\nFollowing Bostock, plaintiffs in multiple jurisdictions sued HHS, challenging the 2020 Rule in \nlight of Bostock and seeking restoration of the 2016 Rule, in whole or in part. See Whitman-Walker \nClinic, Inc. v. U.S. Dep’t of Health & Human Servs., No. 20-cv-01630 (D.D.C. filed June 22, \n2020); Walker v. Azar, No. 20-cv-02834 (E.D.N.Y. filed June 26, 2020); Boston All. of Gay, \nLesbian, Bisexual & Transgender Youth v. U.S. Dep’t of Health & Human Servs., No. 20-cv-11297 \n(D. Mass. filed July 9, 2020); Washington v. U.S. Dep’t of Health & Human Servs., No. 20-cv-\n01105 (W.D. Wash. filed July 16, 2020); New York v. U.S. Dep’t of Health & Human Servs., No. \n20-cv-05583 (S.D.N.Y. filed July 20, 2020). \nIn this new round of litigation, two district courts have now entered “overlapping injunctions,” \nWhitman-Walker Clinic, Inc. v. U.S. Dep’t of Health & Human Servs., No. 20-cv-01630, 2020 WL \n5232076, at *41 (D.D.C. Sept. 2, 2020) (internal quotation marks omitted), preventing the 2020 \nRule “from becoming operative” and reinstating portions of the 2016 Rule, Walker v. Azar, No. \n20-cv-02834, 2020 WL 4749859, at *1 (E.D.N.Y. Aug. 17, 2020). One of these courts has \nspecifically held that portions of the 2016 Rule vacated by the Franciscan Alliance district court—\nincluding “the definitions of ‘on the basis of sex,’ ‘gender identity,’ and ‘sex stereotyping’”—\n“remain in effect.” Walker, 2020 WL 4749859, at *10. The other court has held that a portion of \nthe 2016 Rule purportedly not vacated by the Franciscan Alliance court—namely, defining “sex” \nto include “sex stereotyping”—independently prohibits “[d]iscrimination based on transgender \nstatus—i.e., gender identity.” Whitman-Walker, 2020 WL 5232076, at *23, 45. \nII.  Argument \nThe parties respectfully request that the Court lift the stay entered on August 24, 2017, ECF \nNo. 56. The Court stayed these consolidated cases “in order to allow HHS to reconsider the \ncontroversial rules and regulations at issue.” Id. HHS has now reconsidered the 2016 Rule and \nfinalized the 2020 Rule, so—as the parties agree—there is now no reason for the stay to be \nmaintained. \nUpon the lifting of the stay, Plaintiffs intend to file amended complaints revising their \nallegations and claims to account for factual developments after the stay was entered, including \n5 \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 92   Filed 11/06/20   Page 6 of 8\nthose summarized above. Plaintiffs filed these cases because Defendants’ interpretation of the \nACA threatened to require them to perform and provide insurance coverage for gender transitions \nand abortions in violation of their religious beliefs and medical judgment. The particular regulation \nin which Defendants first promulgated that interpretation has now been vacated in part. But other \nfederal courts have now called into question the efficacy of the vacatur, purporting to revive the \nvery provisions of the 2016 Rule that burdened Plaintiffs. Moreover, in light of Bostock, even \nDefendants’ current regulation interpreting Section 1557—the 2020 Rule—threatens to reimpose \nthe same requirement Plaintiffs have challenged throughout this case. Plaintiffs therefore intend to \ncontinue to seek final injunctive relief from this Court. \nThe parties have agreed that Plaintiffs, with Defendants’ consent, will file amended complaints \nwithin 14 days of an order of this Court lifting the stay. The parties further agree that Defendants’ \nresponse to Plaintiffs’ amended complaints will be due within 30 days after the filing of the \namended complaints.  \nIII.  Conclusion \nPlaintiffs respectfully request that the Court lift the stay and set an agreed schedule for the \nfiling of Plaintiffs’ amended complaints, and Defendants’ responses to the amended complaints, \nas set out above. Defendants consent to the relief requested. \n   \n6 \n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 92   Filed 11/06/20   Page 7 of 8\nRespectfully submitted this 6th day of November, 2020. \n /s/ Luke W.

Azar, 513 F. Supp. 3d\n1113, 1122 (D.N.D. 2021), judgment entered sub nom. Religious Sisters of Mercy v.\nCochran, No. 3:16-cv-00386, 2021 WL 1574628 (D.N.D. Feb. 19, 2021). According\nto the plaintiffs, “the Department of Health and Human Services (‘HHS’) and,\nderivatively, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (‘EEOC’) interpret\nSection 1557 and related antidiscrimination laws in a way that compels them to\nperform and provide insurance coverage for gender transitions.” Id. The district court\nheld “that the [Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 (RFRA)] entitles the\n. . . [p]laintiffs to permanent injunctive relief from the provision or coverage of\ngender-transition procedures.” Id. On appeal, HHS and the EEOC (collectively, “the\ngovernment”) challenge the district court’s grant of declaratory and permanent\ninjunctive relief to the plaintiffs, arguing that the district court erred in determining\n“that plaintiffs had demonstrated standing, ripeness, and imminent irreparable injury\nsufficient to justify permanent injunctive relief.” Appellants’ Br. at ii. We affirm. \nI. Background\nA. Statutes Prohibiting Sex-Based Discrimination\nSection 1557 of the ACA provides, in relevant part, that a federally funded or\nadministered health program or activity is prohibited from denying benefits to, or\nsubjecting to discrimination, an individual “on [a] ground prohibited under . . . title\nIX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (20 U.S.C. 1681 et seq.).” 42 U.S.C.\n§ 18116(a). Section 1557 adopts the enforcement mechanisms available under the\nincorporated statutes, including Title IX. Id. Section 1557 vests the Secretary of HHS\n-2-\n\nwith  discretion  to  promulgate  implementing  regulations.  Id.  §  18116(c)  (“The\nSecretary [of HHS] may promulgate regulations to implement this section.”). \n In turn, Title IX states that “[n]o person in the United States shall, on the basis\nof sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected\nto discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial\nassistance.” 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a) (emphasis added). “In short, the statute bars . . . sex-\nbased discrimination.” Portz v. St. Cloud St. Univ., 16 F.4th 577, 580 (8th Cir. 2021)\n(internal quotation marks omitted). But Title IX exempts from its restrictions “an\neducational  institution  which  is  controlled  by  a  religious  organization  if  the\napplication of this subsection would not be consistent with the religious tenets of such\norganization.” 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a)(3). Title IX “authoriz[es] federal administrative\nenforcement by terminating the federal funding of any noncomplying recipient, [20\nU.S.C.] § 1682(1), or ‘by any other means authorized by law,’ § 1682(2).” Nat’l\nCollegiate Athletic Ass’n v. Smith, 525 U.S. 459, 467 n.5 (1999). The Supreme “Court\nhas [also] recognized an implied private right of action.” Fitzgerald v. Barnstable\nSch. Comm., 555 U.S. 246, 255 (2009).\nIn addition to Title IX and Section 1557, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of\n1964 prohibits employers from discriminating against an applicant or employee\n“because of such individual’s . . . sex.” 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a)(1). Title VII “limit[s]\n. . . covered ‘employer[s]’ to those with 15 or more employees.” Fort Bend Cnty. v.\nDavis, 139 S. Ct. 1843, 1850 (2019) (third alteration in original) (quoting Arbaugh\nv. Y & H Corp., 546 U.S. 500, 503–04 (2006) (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 2000e(b))). An\nemployer who violates Title VII could face an administrative enforcement action or\nprivate suit for compensatory damages, punitive damages, injunctive relief, attorney’s\nfees, and other relief. See 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(g); id. § 1981a(b). The EEOC “is\nempowered . . . to prevent any person from engaging in any unlawful employment\npractice” under Title VII. Id. § 2000e-5(a). “We have . . . held that ‘the Supreme\nCourt’s interpretation of Title VII properly informs our examination of Title IX.’”\n-3-\n\nDu Bois v. Bd. of Regents of Univ. of Minn., 987 F.3d 1199, 1203 (8th Cir. 2021)\n(quoting Wolfe v. Fayetteville, Ark. Sch. Dist., 648 F.3d 860, 866 (8th Cir. 2011)\n(applying Title VII jurisprudence to a Title IX discrimination claim)). \nB. 2016 Rule\nIn 2016, HHS promulgated a “final rule implement[ing] Section 1557 of the\nAffordable Care Act (ACA) (Section 1557).” Nondiscrimination in Health Programs\nand Activities, 81 Fed. Reg. 31,375, 31,376 (May 18, 2016) (hereinafter, “2016\nRule”). The 2016 Rule defined “[c]overed entity” as “[a]n entity that operates a health\nprogram or activity, any part of which receives Federal financial assistance.” Id. at\n31,466. It defined “[h]ealth program or activity” as “the provision or administration\nof health-related services, health-related insurance coverage, or other health-related\ncoverage.” Id. at 31,467. For entities “principally engaged” in those endeavors, the\nregulation extended to “all of [their] operations.” Id. at 31,438. In the 2016 Rule,\nHHS “concluded that almost all practicing physicians in the United States are reached\nby  Section  1557  because  they  accept  some  form  of  Federal  remuneration  or\nreimbursement apart from Medicare Part B.” Id. at 31,446. HHS identified 180\ninsurers that offered health plans through ACA or state-based marketplace as affected\nby the  regulation. Id. at 31,448. It also estimated “about 133,343  [healthcare]\nfacilities” were covered entities. Id. at 31,445. \nConsistent with Title IX, the 2016 Rule prohibited discrimination “on the basis\nof . . . sex.” Id. at 31,469. The 2016 Rule defined “[o]n the basis of sex” as\n“includ[ing] . . . sex stereotyping[] and gender identity.” Id. at 31,467. HHS based the\ndefinition of “on the basis of sex” “upon existing regulation and previous Federal\nagencies’ and courts’ interpretations that discrimination on the basis of sex includes\ndiscrimination on the basis of gender identity and sex stereotyping.” Id. at 31,388. It\ndefined “[s]ex stereotypes” as “includ[ing] the expectation that individuals will\nconsistently identify with only one gender and that they will act in conformity with\n-4-\n\nthe gender-related expressions stereotypically associated with that gender.” Id. at\n31,468. It defined “[g]ender identity” as \nan individual’s internal sense of gender, which may be male, female,\nneither,  or  a  combination of  male  and female,  and which may be\ndifferent  from  an  individual’s  sex  assigned  at  birth.  The  way  an\nindividual  expresses  gender  identity  is  frequently  called  “gender\nexpression,”  and  may  or  may  not  conform  to  social  stereotypes\nassociated with a particular gender. A transgender individual is an\nindividual whose gender identity is different from the sex assigned to\nthat person at birth.\nId. at 31,467.\nThe 2016 Rule required a covered entity to \ntreat individuals consistent with their gender identity, except that a\ncovered entity may not deny or limit health services that are ordinarily\nor exclusively available to individuals of one sex, to a transgender\nindividual based on the fact that the individual’s sex assigned at birth,\ngender identity, or gender otherwise recorded is different from the one\nto which such health services are ordinarily or exclusively available. \nId. at 31,471. “For example, . . . . [a] provider specializing in gynecological services\nthat  previously  declined  to  provide  a  medically  necessary  hysterectomy  for  a\ntransgender  man would have  to revise  its policy to provide  the  procedure  for\ntransgender individuals in the same manner it provides the procedure for other\nindividuals.” Id. at 31,455. \nUnder the 2016 Rule, a covered entity’s “denial of a claim for coverage for\ntransition-related care” based on “an explicit, categorical (or automatic) exclusion or\nlimitation of coverage for all health services related to gender transition is unlawful\n-5-\n\non its face.” Id. at 31,429; see also id. at 31,471–72. Additionally, HHS explained\nthat \nin evaluating whether it is discriminatory to deny or limit a request for\ncoverage for a particular service for an individual seeking the service as\npart of transition-related care, . . . [it] w[ould] start by inquiring whether\nand to what extent coverage is available when the same service is not\nrelated to gender transition. If, for example, an issuer or State Medicaid\nagency denies a claim for coverage for a hysterectomy that a patient’s\nprovider says is medically necessary to treat gender dysphoria, [HHS]\nwill evaluate the extent of the covered entity’s coverage policy for\nhysterectomies under other circumstances.\nId. at 31,429. In such circumstance, HHS would “carefully scrutinize whether the\ncovered  entity’s  explanation  for  the  denial  or  limitation  of  coverage  for\ntransition-related care is legitimate and not a pretext for discrimination.” Id. \nWhile the 2016 Rule provided that the statutory exceptions applicable for\ndiscrimination based on race, color, national origin, age, and disability applied, see\nid. at 31,470, it omitted Title IX’s religious exemption, see id. HHS expressly\n“decline[d] to adopt commenters’ suggestion that [it] import Title IX’s blanket\nreligious exemption into Section 1557,” noting that “Section 1557 itself contains no\nreligious exemption” and that “Title IX and its exemption are limited in scope to\neducational institutions.” Id. at 31,380 (footnote omitted). HHS found “significant\ndifferences between the educational and health care contexts that warrant different\napproaches.” Id. Furthermore, it found that \na blanket religious exemption could result in a denial or delay in the\nprovision of health care to individuals and in discouraging individuals\nfrom seeking necessary care, with serious and, in some cases, life\nthreatening results. Thus, it is appropriate to adopt a more nuanced\napproach in the health care context, rather than the blanket religious\nexemption applied for educational institutions under Title IX.\n-6-\n\nId.\nAlthough HHS “decided against including a blanket religious exemption in the\nfinal rule,” id. at 31,376, it excepted applications that “would violate applicable\nFederal statutory protections for religious freedom and conscience,” id. at 31,466.\nAccording to HHS, “the proposed rule would not displace the protections afforded\nby . . . RFRA.” Id. at 31,379 (footnotes omitted). HHS explained that “application of\nRFRA is the proper means to evaluate any religious concerns about the application\nof Section 1557 requirements.” Id. at 31,380. HHS further noted that it would\nevaluate “individualized and fact specific” RFRA claims “on a case-by-case basis.”\nId. “To obtain an exception, in other words, a provider objecting on religious grounds\nneeded to convince HHS that the regulation circumstantially violated the RFRA.”\nAzar, 513 F. Supp. 3d at 1125 (citing R. Doc. 95, at ¶ 51).\n“[S]everal commenters [to the 2016 Rule] recommended that [it] not apply to\nservices of third party administrators providing administrative services to self-insured\ngroup health plans.” 2016 Rule, 81 Fed. Reg. at 31,431. They maintained that Section\n1557 does not apply to third party administrators because they “do not design plans,\nare not responsible for determining the benefits covered under the plan, and are\nrequired by [the Employment Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA)] to administer\nplans as they are written.” Id. (footnote omitted). But HHS declined to “exclud[e]\nthird party administrator services from the final rule.” Id. at 31,432. Instead, it\n“adopt[ed] specific procedures to govern the processing of complaints against third\nparty administrators.” Id. HHS “recognize[d] that third party administrators are\ngenerally  not  responsible  for  the  benefit  design  of  the  self-insured  plans  they\nadminister.” Id. It also recognized that “ERISA . . . requires plans to be administered\nconsistent with their terms. Thus, if a plan has a discriminatory benefit designed\nunder Section 1557, a third party administrator could be held responsible for plan\nfeatures over which it has no control.” Id. HHS responded to this problem by\n-7-\n\n“adjusting  the  way  in  which  it  .  .  .  process[es]  claims  that  involve  alleged\ndiscrimination  in  self-insured  group  health  plans  administered  by  third  party\nadministrators that are covered entities.” Id. HHS would “refer matters to other\n[f]ederal agencies with jurisdiction over [an] entity” not under HHS’s jurisdiction. Id. \nWhere,  for  example,  [HHS]  lacks  jurisdiction  over  an  employer\nresponsible for benefit design, [HHS] typically will refer or transfer the\nmatter to the EEOC and allow that agency to address the matter. The\nEEOC  has  informed  [HHS]  that,  provided  the  filing  meets  the\nrequirements for an EEOC charge, the date a complaint was filed with\n[HHS] will be deemed the date it was filed with the EEOC . . . . \nId. \nAt the time of the 2016 Rule’s publication, the “EEOC [had] interpret[ed] and\nenforce[d] Title VII’s prohibition of sex discrimination as forbidding any employment\ndiscrimination based on gender identity or sexual orientation.” R. Doc. 97-7, at 1.\n“Some examples of LGBT-related claims that EEOC view[ed] as unlawful sex\ndiscrimination  include[d]  .  .  .  [f]ailing  to  hire  an  applicant  because  she  is  a\ntransgender woman. . . . [and] [d]iscriminating against or harassing an employee\nbecause of his or her . . . gender identity, . . . for example, on the basis of transgender\nstatus.” Id. at 2. Indeed, the EEOC had previously found “intentional discrimination\nagainst  a  transgender  individual  because  that  person’s  gender  identity  is,  by\ndefinition, discrimination based on sex and therefore violates Title VII.” Id. at 3\n(citing Macy v. Holder, EEOC Appeal No. 0120120821, 2012 WL 1435995 (April\n20, 2012)). The EEOC continues to follow this interpretation of Title VII . See EEOC,\nFact  Sheet:  Recent  EEOC  Litigation  Regarding  Title  VII  &  LGBT-Related\nDiscrimination, https://www.eeoc.gov/fact-sheet-recent-eeoc-litigation-regarding-t\nitle-vii-lgbt-related-discrimination (last updated July 8, 2016). \n-8-\n\nShortly after the 2016 Rule took partial effect, a group of states and private\nreligious healthcare providers filed suit in the Northern District of Texas. See\nFranciscan All., Inc. v. Burwell (Franciscan Alliance I), 227 F. Supp. 3d 660 (N.D.\nTex. 2016). That district court entered “a nationwide [preliminary] injunction,” id. at\n695,  prohibiting  HHS  from  “enforcing  the  [2016]  Rule’s  prohibition  against\ndiscrimination on the basis of gender identity,” id. at 696. First, the court determined\nthat  the  2016  Rule  violated  the  Administrative  Procedures  Act  (APA)  by\nimpermissibly expanding the scope of sex discrimination under Title IX to include\ngender identity. Id. at 689. Second, the court concluded that the 2016 “Rule’s failure\nto include Title IX’s religious exemptions renders the Rule contrary to law.” Id. at\n691. Third, the court found that the plaintiffs “demonstrated a substantial likelihood\nof success on their claim that the [2016] Rule violates RFRA.” Id. at 693.\nContemporaneously, the two cases giving rise  to this appeal were  filed.\nRelevant to the present appeal, the Religious Sisters of Mercy,1 Sacred Heart Mercy\nHealth Care Center,2 SMP Health System,3 and the University of Mary4 (collectively,\n1Religious Sisters of Mercy is “a Catholic order of religious sisters devoted to\nworks of mercy, including offering healthcare to the underserved.” R. Doc. 96-2, at\n¶ 2. It is a nonprofit corporation located in Alma, Michigan, and “officially approved\nby the Vatican.” Id. ¶ 3. The sisters “have chosen to follow Jesus Christ by taking a\nlifetime vow to serve the poor and sick by offering care for the whole person, and\nworking to heal those who are suffering from physical, psychological, intellectual,\nand spiritual woundedness.” Id. at ¶ 4. As part of that mission, some sisters serve as\nlicensed healthcare professionals.\n2The Religious Sisters of Mercy own and operate Sacred Heart Mercy Health\nCare Center (Sacred Heart), a nonprofit clinic located in Alma, Michigan. “Some of\nthe Religious Sisters of Mercy serve as licensed doctors, nurses, or other healthcare\nprofessionals who perform medical services in this clinic.” Id. at ¶ 6. Sacred Heart\nserves “poor, disabled, and elderly Medicare and Medicaid patients.” Id. at ¶ 8. “The\nReligious Sisters of Mercy . . . run the clinic in accordance with the Ethical and\n-9-\n\n“RSM plaintiffs”)5 filed suit, alleging that HHS had violated, among other things, the\nAPA, the First Amendment, and the RFRA. Additionally, the Catholic Benefits\nAssociation (CBA);6 Diocese of Fargo (Diocese);7 Catholic Charities North Dakota\nReligious Directives of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops.” Id. ¶ 6.\n3“SMP Health System is operated according to the religious beliefs of its\nsponsor, the Sisters of Mary of the Presentation.” R.

It is headquartered\nin Valley City, North Dakota, and operates healthcare facilities in North Dakota and\nIllinois. “SMP Health System has a special emphasis on providing services to the\npoor and elderly, including many Medicare and Medicaid patients.” Id. at ¶ 4. “The\nSisters of Mary of the Presentation operate SMP Health System in a manner that\nabides by The Ethical and Religious Directives for Catholic Healthcare Services, as\nissued by the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops and interpreted by the\nlocal Bishop.” Id. at ¶ 5 (emphasis omitted).\n4The University of Mary (University) is a Roman Catholic university founded\nby the Benedictine Sisters and located in Bismarck, North Dakota. “The University\nwelcomes students of all faiths and backgrounds,” but it “ upholds Catholic teaching\nin its programs and services.” R. Doc. 96-4, at ¶ 6. The University offers a nursing\nprogram and operates a student health clinic that both receive funding from HHS.\n5Each of the RSM plaintiffs believe “that every man and woman is created in\nthe image and likeness of God, and that they reflect God’s image in unique—and\nuniquely dignified—ways.” R. Docs. 96-2, at ¶ 9; 96-3, at ¶ 6; 96-4, at ¶ 9. Each of\nthem also serves every individual who needs and qualifies for care, including\ntransgender persons. But the RSM plaintiffs believe that performing gender-transition\nprocedures would violate their medical judgment by potentially causing harm to\npatients. Additionally, they believe that they would violate their religious beliefs\nregarding human sexuality and procreation if they performed, among other things,\ngender-transition  services.  They  also  object  for  religious  reasons  to  providing\ninsurance coverage for their eligible employees for gender transitions.\n6The CBA is a nonprofit corporation and Catholic ministry. One of its purposes\nis “[t]o support Catholic employers . . . that, as part of their religious witness and\n-10-\n\n(Catholic Charities);8 and Catholic Medical Association (CMA)9 (collectively, “CBA\nexercise, provide health or other benefits to their respective employees in a manner\nthat is consistent with Catholic values.” R. Doc. 97-1, at 2. The CBA’s membership\nincludes over 1,030 employers and 5,100 Catholic parishes within more than 60\ndioceses and archdioceses. Collectively, its membership covers more than 90,000\nemployees and their families. Only Catholic employers that commit to providing\nbenefits and services consistent with Catholic values may become CBA members.\nSeveral  CBA  members  receive  funding  from  Medicare,  Medicaid,  or  other\nHHS-administered programs for healthcare or health-related services. Additionally,\nsome employer members like Catholic dioceses and archdioceses offer employee\nhealth benefits in conjunction with health insurers and third-party administrators that\nreceive federal financial assistance.\n7The Diocese’s purpose is to carry out the spiritual, educational, and social\nservice mission of the Catholic Church in eastern North Dakota. It employs more than\n15 individuals and operates a self-insured health plan for its employees. Additionally,\nseveral Catholic parishes and affiliated ministries within the Diocese participate in\nthe health plan. Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Dakota (BCBSND) is the third-party\nadministrator that administers the Diocese’s health plan. BCBSND receives federal\nfinancial assistance through an ACA exchange. The Diocese has an indemnification\nagreement with BCBSND for decisions related to health plan design, such as the\nexclusion of gender-transition coverage.\n8Catholic Charities uses social service programs to serve the poor, elderly, and\ndisabled. Its social service programs include disaster relief, individual and family\ncounseling, adoption services, pregnancy counseling, and guardianship services for\nadults with special needs. It employs more than 15 individuals. Catholic Charities\ncontracts with an insurer that receives federal financial assistance from HHS to\nprovide benefits to its employees.\n9CMA is a national, physician-led community of healthcare professionals. Its\npurpose is to uphold Catholic-faith principles in the science and practice of medicine.\nCMA members promise to adhere to Catholic moral principles, particularly those\nrelated to bio-medical ethics. Consistent with their faith, CMA members do not\nprovide gender-transition services. Some CMA members do perform procedures like\n-11-\n\nplaintiffs”) filed suit, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief pursuant to the RFRA\nagainst HHS’s and the EEOC’s interpretation and enforcement of the relevant statutes\nto the extent they required the CBA plaintiffs to “provide, perform, pay for, cover, or\nfacilitate access to health services for gender transition.” R. Doc. 97, at 81. The\ndistrict court stayed enforcement of the 2016 Rule’s prohibition against gender-based\nidentity discrimination as applied to the RSM plaintiffs and CBA plaintiffs. The court\nalso acknowledged Franciscan Alliance I’s nationwide preliminary injunction.\nFollowing these decisions, the present case and the Franciscan Alliance case\nwere stayed to enable HHS to consider further rulemaking. \nOver a year passed while a draft of a new proposed rule circulated through the\nexecutive  branch.  Then,  in  December  2018,  the  Franciscan  Alliance  litigation\nrestarted. The plaintiffs in that case moved for partial summary judgment and\npermanent injunctive relief as to only the APA and RFRA claims. The district court\ngranted the plaintiffs’ summary-judgment motion. Franciscan All., Inc. v. Azar\n(Franciscan Alliance II), 414 F. Supp. 3d 928, 944 (N.D. Tex. 2019). First, it found\n“no reason to depart from its analysis on the APA claim.” Id. at 942. Second, it held\n“that the [2016] Rule, which expressly prohibits religious exemptions, substantially\nburdens Private Plaintiffs’ religious exercise in violation of RFRA.” Id. at 944. “But\nit declined to issue an injunction because it found there was no indication that, if the\nrule  was vacated,  HHS  would bring an enforcement action against Franciscan\nAlliance.” Franciscan All., Inc. v. Becerra (Franciscan Alliance V), 47 F.4th 368, 372\n(5th Cir. 2022). Instead, it vacated the gender-identity prohibition, among other\nthings, and remanded to HHS for further consideration.

Supp. 3d at 947. “Soon thereafter, the [c]ourt modified the Final Judgment to\nclarify that it vacated the 2016 Rule insofar as it defined ‘on the basis of sex’ to\ninclude gender identity . . . .” Franciscan All., Inc. v.

Oct. 1, 2021). “Franciscan Alliance timely appealed\nthe denial of permanent injunctive relief.” Franciscan Alliance V, 47 F.4th at 372.\nC. 2020 Rule and Bostock Decision\n“[T]he landscape [then] drastically shifted.” Franciscan Alliance IV, 553 F.\nSupp. 3d at 366. In June 2020, HHS repealed the 2016 Rule and finalized a new\nSection 1557 rule. Nondiscrimination in Health and Health Education Programs or\nActivities, Delegation of Authority, 85 Fed. Reg. 37,160 (June 19, 2020) (hereinafter,\n“2020 Rule”). The 2020 Rule adopted Title IX’s religious exemption and “repeal[ed]\nthe 2016 Rule’s definition of ‘on the basis of sex,’ but decline[d] to replace it with a\nnew regulatory definition. Instead, the [2020] [R]ule revert[ed] to, and relie[d] upon,\nthe plain meaning of the term in [Title IX].” Id. at 37,178 (citation omitted).\nAt the time that HHS issued the 2020 Rule, Bostock v. Clayton County, 140\nS. Ct. 1731 (2020), was pending. The question presented in Bostock was whether an\nemployer violates Title VII’s proscription of discrimination “because of . . . sex” by\n“fir[ing] an individual for being homosexual or transgender.” Id. at 1737. HHS\nacknowledged that “a holding by the U.S. Supreme Court on the meaning of ‘on the\nbasis of sex’ under Title VII will likely have ramifications for the definition of ‘on\nthe basis of sex’ under Title IX.” 2020 Rule, 85 Fed. Reg. at 37,168. HHS further\nacknowledged that “to the extent that a Supreme Court decision is applicable in\ninterpreting the meaning of a statutory term, the elimination of a regulatory definition\nof such term would not preclude application of the Court’s construction.” Id.\n-13-\n\nLike the 2016 Rule, the 2020 Rule did “not craft a religious exemption to\nSection 1557.” Id. at 37,207. HHS reasoned that “Congress has already created\nvarious  religious  and  conscience  protections  in  healthcare  by  enacting  several\nstatutes,  including  RFRA,  healthcare  conscience  statutes,  and  the  religious\norganization exception in Title IX.” Id. The 2020 Rule provided that Section 1557\n“will be implemented consistent with those statutes.” Id. \nShortly after HHS finalized the 2020 Rule, the Supreme Court decided Bostock.\nThe Court held that “[w]hen an employer fires an employee for being homosexual or\ntransgender, it necessarily and intentionally discriminates against that individual in\npart because of sex” under Title VII. 140 S. Ct. at 1744. In other words, the Court\ninterpreted Title VII’s prohibition on “sex discrimination” to include gender identity\nand sexual orientation. Although the Court “proceed[ed] on the assumption that ‘sex’\n. . . refer[s] only to biological distinctions between male and female,” id. at 1739, it\ndetermined  that  “it  is  impossible  to  discriminate  against  a  person  for  being\nhomosexual or transgender without discriminating against that individual based on\nsex,” id. at 1741. But the Court cautioned that it was not “prejudg[ing]” whether its\n“decision will sweep beyond Title VII to other federal or state laws that prohibit sex\ndiscrimination.”  Id.  at  1753.  The  Court  also  expressed  “deep[]  concern[]  with\npreserving the promise of the free exercise of religion enshrined in our Constitution.”\nId. at 1754. “But,” the Court noted, “worries about how Title VII may intersect with\nreligious liberties are nothing new.” Id. In fact, Congress went “a step further . . . in\n. . . RFRA” by “prohibit[ing] the federal government from substantially burdening a\nperson’s exercise of religion unless it demonstrates that doing so both furthers a\ncompelling  governmental  interest  and  represents  the  least  restrictive  means  of\nfurthering that interest.” Id. “Because RFRA operates as a kind of super statute,\ndisplacing the normal operation of other federal laws,” the Court explained, “it might\nsupersede Title VII’s commands in appropriate cases.” Id. Thus, “other employers in\nother cases may raise free exercise arguments that merit careful consideration.” Id. \n-14-\n\n“Bostock triggered multiple lawsuits challenging the 2020 Rule. Most relevant\nhere, two courts entered nationwide injunctions preventing much of the 2020 Rule\nfrom going into effect, effectively reinstating portions of the 2016 Rule (the [Walker]\nand Whitman-Walker opinions).” Franciscan Alliance V, 47 F.4th at 372 (citing\nWhitman-Walker Clinic, Inc. v. HHS, 485 F. Supp. 3d 1, 60 (D.D.C. 2020); Walker\nv. Azar, 480 F. Supp. 3d 417, 420 (E.D.N.Y. 2020)). While the Walker and Whitman-\nWalker courts recognized that they lacked any power to undo the Franciscan Alliance\ndistrict court’s vacatur, “in effect they did just that.” Id. Neither court “directly\nresurrect[ed]  the  2016  Rule’s  prohibition  on  ‘gender  identity’  discrimination”;\nhowever, “they did reanimate the rule’s ‘sex-stereotyping’ prohibition.” Id. (citing\nWhitman-Walker, 485 F. Supp. 3d at 64; Walker, 480 F. Supp. 3d at 430). “Both\ncourts further reasoned that, in light of Bostock, sex-stereotyping discrimination\nencompasses gender identity discrimination.” Id. (citing Whitman-Walker, 485 F.\nSupp. 3d at 39–42; Walker, 480 F. Supp. 3d at 429–30). Additionally, the Whitman-\nWalker  court  “enjoined  the  2020  Rule’s  incorporation  of  Title  IX’s  religious\nexemption, even though the [Franciscan Alliance] district court . . . held that the 2016\nRule was unlawful for not providing such an exemption.” Id. (footnote omitted)\n(citing Whitman-Walker, 485 F. Supp. 3d at 64).\nD. Present Lawsuit\nOn November 6, 2020, the RSM plaintiffs and CBA plaintiffs (collectively,\n“plaintiffs”) moved to lift the stay in the present case. The district court granted the\nmotion. \nOn November 23, 2020, the plaintiffs timely filed amended complaints and\ncontemporaneously moved for partial summary judgment and permanent injunctive\nrelief. The RSM plaintiffs challenged HHS’s interpretation of Section 1557 to\n“require[] [them] to provide and insure gender-transition procedures . . . or else face\n-15-\n\nliability for ‘sex’ discrimination.” R. Doc. 96, at 1–2. They moved for partial\nsummary judgment, arguing that HHS’s interpretation of Section 1557 violates the\nRFRA and the APA. The CBA plaintiffs relied exclusively on the RFRA. They\nrequested relief from the same interpretation of Section 1557, as well as from parallel\ninterpretations of Title VII, Title IX, or any other federal laws. In the alternative, all\nthe plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction. \nThe government responded in opposition to the motions and moved to dismiss\nboth cases in their entirety for lack of jurisdiction. It argued that the plaintiffs did not\nhave standing because they lacked a cognizable injury; the claims were moot because\n“HHS has repealed the challenged portions of the 2016 Rule and incorporate[d]\nreligious . . . exemptions that apply to [the] [p]laintiffs”; and the claims were “unripe\nto the degree any alleged injury is based on any possible future regulatory or\nenforcement action.” R. Doc. 113, at 15. \n1. Jurisdiction\na. Standing\ni. Section 1557\nThe district court first considered whether the plaintiffs have standing to\nchallenge HHS’s current interpretation of Section 1557. It determined that the RSM\nplaintiffs “qualify as objects of Section 1557 and its implementing regulations”\nbecause they “operate health programs receiving federal financial assistance from\nHHS.” Azar, 513 F. Supp. 3d at 1136. \nIt then concluded that the CBA has associational standing to challenge HHS’s\ninterpretation of Section 1557. See id. (citing Sierra Club v. U.S. Army Corps of\nEng’rs, 645 F.3d 978, 986 (8th Cir. 2011). According to the court, “[t]he CBA’s\npurpose of supporting Catholic employers that wish to provide employee benefits\nconsistent with their religious beliefs is . . . germane to a lawsuit that challenges\n-16-\n\nregulations affecting members’ health plans.” Id. at 1137. The court determined that\nthe  individual members’ participation  is  not required because  the  CBA,  as an\norganization plaintiff, “s[ought] only declaratory and prospective relief.” Id. (quoting\nHeartland Acad. Cmty. Church v. Waddle, 427 F.3d 525, 533 (8th Cir. 2005)). “As\nfor the ability of individual members to sue,” the court concluded that “the CBA’s\nverified second amended complaint confirms that its membership includes Catholic\nhospitals and other healthcare entities ‘that receive Medicaid and Medicare payments\nand participate in HHS-funded programs.’” Id. (quoting R. Doc. 97, at ¶¶ 55–56). \nBecause “at least some CBA members [are] on equal footing with the [RSM]\n[p]laintiffs,” the question was “whether those Plaintiffs—and, by implication, the\nsimilarly situated CBA members—possess standing.” Id. (citing Susan B. Anthony\nList v. Driehaus, 573 U.S. 149, 157–58 (2014)). The district court determined that an\ninjury-in-fact existed for three reasons. “First,” the court concluded, “the [p]laintiffs’\nconduct  implicates  constitutional  interests”;  specifically,  the  “exercise  of  their\nreligious beliefs protected by the First Amendment.” Id. at 1138. \n“Second,”  the  court  reasoned,  “Section  1557  ‘arguably  proscribe[s]’  the\n[p]laintiffs’ refusal to perform or cover gender-transition procedures.” Id. (first\nalteration in original) (quoting Susan B. Anthony List, 573 U.S. at 162). As support,\nthe  district  court  noted  that  “two  district  courts  entered  partially  overlapping\npreliminary injunctions that collectively reinstate the prior definition of ‘on the basis\nof sex’ to include ‘gender identity’ and ‘sex stereotyping.’” Id. (citing Walker, 480\nF. Supp. 3d at 430; Whitman-Walker, 485 F. Supp. 3d at 65–65). The court also noted\nthat “[t]he Whitman-Walker court . . . enjoined incorporation of the Title IX religious\nexemption.” Id. (citing Whitman-Walker, 485 F. Supp. 3d at 64–65). Furthermore, the\ncourt concluded, “the [p]laintiffs face potential consequences from the 2020 Rule\neven without the injunctions. . . . because HHS declined to promulgate a new\nregulatory definition for ‘sex,’ instead leaving the door open to ‘application of the\n-17-\n\n[Bostock] Court’s construction.’” Id. at 1138 (third alteration in original) (quoting\n2020 Rule, 85 Fed. Reg. at 37,168). Recent decisions following Bostock and “HHS’s\nown statements” indicated that “the [p]laintiffs’ refusal to perform or cover gender-\ntransition procedures arguably falls within the ambit of Section 1557.” Id. at 1139.\n“Third,” the court concluded that “a credible threat of enforcement endures”\nbecause “Section 1557 is amenable to an interpretation that would expose the\nPlaintiffs to liability for declining to provide or insure gender-transition services.” Id.\nThe court found “no evidence . . . that authorities have actually refused to enforce the\nstatute.” Id. (internal quotation marks omitted). Instead, “HHS has undertaken two\nrulemakings to refine enforcement parameters in the ten years following Section\n1557’s enactment.” Id. \nThe court also determined that the second and third standing requirements are\nsatisfied: “HHS’s responsibility to enforce Section 1557 supplies a sufficient causal\nrelationship to the asserted injuries, which declaratory and injunctive relief will likely\nredress.” Id. \nAs a result, the court held that the RSM “[p]laintiffs have standing to challenge\nHHS’s interpretation of Section 1557 that requires them to perform and provide\ninsurance coverage for gender-transition procedures” and that the CBA plaintiffs\n“possess[] associational standing to sue on behalf of [the] members, including the\nDiocese, Catholic Charities, and the CMA.” Id. at 1141. \nii. Title VII\nThe court next held that “the CBA has associational standing to pursue RFRA\nclaims against the EEOC’s interpretation of Title VII.” Id. The associational standing\nrequirements were satisfied for the same reasons given with respect to the Section\n1557 claim. See id. And, the court concluded that the “three-part injury-in-fact\n-18-\n\nstandard,” id. at 1141, including the primarily disputed requirement of “threatened\nenforcement,” id. at 1142, was satisfied. The court noted that “[t]he EEOC has never\ndisavowed an intent to enforce Title VII’s prohibition on gender-transition exclusions\nin health plans against the CBA or its members” and “has enforced that very\ninterpretation against other employers.” Id. at 1142. The standing requirements of\ncausation  and  redressability  were  satisfied  because  “[t]he  EEOC  shoulders\nenforcement responsibility for Title VII, and declaratory and injunctive relief will\nlikely redress the threat of enforcement.” Id.10 \nb. Ripeness\nThe  court  held  that  “[t]he  [p]laintiffs’  surviving  claims  against  the\ninterpretations of Section 1557 and Title VII” are “ripe for review.” Id. at 1145. First,\nthe claims “present purely legal questions . . . and need no additional factual\ndevelopment.” Id.  (internal quotation marks omitted). Second, “[p]ractical harm is\nmanifest . . . because the [p]laintiffs must either alter their policies for providing and\ncovering gender-transition procedures . . . or risk the loss of critical federal healthcare\nfunding along with potential civil and criminal penalties.” Id. \nc. Mootness\nThe court held that “neither case is moot because nothing has changed since\nthe [p]laintiffs submitted their amended complaints.” Id. at 1146. Specifically, the\nplaintiffs “remain subject to the interpretations of Section 1557 and Title VII that\nspurred them to move for relief. . . . , and the challenged legal regime has stayed\nconstant since this litigation recommenced.” Id. \n10The district court held that the CBA plaintiffs lacked standing to seek relief\nunder Title IX and other federal laws. That claim is not at issue in this appeal. \n-19-\n\nd. Summary of Jurisdictional Holdings\nThe court held that it “w[ould] exercise jurisdiction over the [p]laintiffs’ RFRA\n. . .  claim[] challenging the interpretations of Section 1557 and Title VII that compel\nthem to perform and provide insurance coverage for gender transitions.” Id. at 1146. \n2. Summary Judgment \nThe district court held that “[a]s applied, the challenged interpretations of\nSection 1557 and Title VII violate the RFRA” and, as a result, summary judgment\nwas appropriate. Id. at 1149. First, the court concluded that “a substantial burden\nweighs on the exercise of religion” “[b]ecause the interpretations of Section 1557 and\nTitle VII threaten to penalize the Catholic [p]laintiffs for adhering to their beliefs.”\nId. at 1147–48. \nSecond,  the  court  concluded  that  “less  restrictive  alternatives”  existed,\nincluding the government (1) “assum[ing] the cost of providing gender-transition\nprocedures for those unable to obtain them under their health-insurance policies due\nto their employers’ religious objections”; (2) “providing subsidies, reimbursements,\ntax credits, or tax deductions to employees”; (3) “paying for services at community\nhealth  centers,  public  clinics,  and  hospitals  with  income-based  support”;  (4)\n“treat[ing]  employees  whose  employers  do  not  provide  complete  coverage  for\nreligious  reasons  the  same  as  it  does  employees  whose  employers  provide  no\ncoverage at all”; and (5) “assist[ing] transgender individuals in finding and paying for\ntransition procedures available from the growing number of healthcare providers who\noffer and specialize in those services.” Id. at 1149 (cleaned up).\n3. Injunctive Relief \nThe district court “permanently enjoin[ed] the [d]efendants from enforcing the\nsuccessfully  challenged  interpretations  of  federal  law  against  the  Catholic\n[p]laintiffs.” Id. at 1153. It explained, “[W]ith actual success on the RFRA claims\n-20-\n\nestablished, ‘the other requirements for obtaining a[n] . . . injunction are generally\ndeemed to have been satisfied.’” Id. at 1153 (second and third alterations in original)\n(quoting Minn. Citizens Concerned for Life, Inc. v. Swanson, 692 F.3d 864, 870 (8th\nCir. 2012) (en banc)). \n4. Summary of Holdings\nIn summary, the district court (1) declared that HHS’s interpretation of Section\n1557 requiring the plaintiffs to perform or provide insurance coverage for gender-\ntransition procedures violates the plaintiffs’ sincerely held religious beliefs and fails\nto satisfy strict scrutiny under the RFRA; (2) permanently enjoined HHS and the\nEEOC  “from  interpreting  or  enforcing  Section  1557  of  the  ACA,  42  U.S.C.\n§ 18116(a), or any implementing regulations thereto against the Catholic Plaintiffs\nin a manner that would require them to perform or provide insurance coverage for\ngender-transition procedures”; (3) declared that the EEOC’s interpretation of Title\nVII requiring the CBA and the CBA members to provide insurance coverage for\ngender-transition procedures violates their sincerely held religious beliefs and fails\nto satisfy strict scrutiny under the RFRA; and (4) permanently enjoined the EEOC\n“from interpreting or enforcing Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C.\n§ 2000e et seq., or any implementing regulations thereto against the CBA and its\nmembers in a manner that would require them to provide insurance coverage for\ngender-transition procedures.” Id. at 1153–54.\n \nE. Subsequent Developments\n1. HHS\nThe day after the district court’s order, President Joseph R. Biden, Jr., issued\nan executive order, citing Bostock, which declared that “laws that prohibit sex\ndiscrimination . . . prohibit discrimination on the basis of gender identity or sexual\norientation.” Exec. Order No. 13,988, 86 Fed. Reg. 7023, 7023 (Jan. 20, 2021).\n-21-\n\nPresident Biden directed federal agencies to “fully implement statutes that prohibit\nsex discrimination” consistent with the Administration’s interpretation. Id.\nIn April 2021, the Fifth Circuit issued an opinion on the Franciscan Alliance\nplaintiffs’ appeal of the district court’s denial of permanent injunctive relief. See\nFranciscan All., Inc. v. Becerra (Franciscan Alliance III), 843 F. App’x 662 (5th Cir.\n2021) (unpublished per curiam). The Fifth Circuit “remanded the case to the district\ncourt because ‘the legal landscape ha[d] shifted significantly’ since the district court\ndenied injunctive relief.” Franciscan Alliance V, 47 F.4th at 373 (alteration in\noriginal) (quoting Franciscan Alliance III, 843 F. App’x at 662).\nIn May 2021, HHS issued a notification. See Notification of Interpretation and\nEnforcement of  Section 1157 of  the Affordable  Care  Act and Title  IX of  the\nEducation Amendments of 1972, 86 Fed. Reg. 27,984-02, 27,984 (May 25, 2021)\n(hereinafter,  “2021  Notification”).  The  2021  Notification  advised  that  “[HHS]\nw[ould] interpret and enforce Section 1557’s prohibition on discrimination on the\nbasis of sex” “[c]onsistent with the Supreme Court’s decision in Bostock.” Id. at\n27,985. As a result, HHS “include[d] . . . [d]iscrimination on the basis of sexual\norientation . . . and . . .  discrimination on the basis of gender identity” as part of the\n“prohibition on discrimination.” Id. “This interpretation w[ould] guide [HHS] in\nprocessing complaints and conducting investigations”; however, it was not the\ndeterminative factor of “the outcome in any particular case or set of facts.” Id. The\n2021 Notification recognized that “[HHS] w[ould] comply with the [RFRA].” Id. “It\nalso encouraged members of the public to file complaints with HHS if they believed\nthe rule had been violated.” Franciscan Alliance V, 47 F.4th at 373 (citing 2020 Rule,\n85 Fed. Reg. at 27,985). \nIn August 2021, the Franciscan Alliance “district court ruled on Franciscan\nAlliance’s motion for a permanent injunction.” Id. at 373. While HHS argued “that\n-22-\n\nthe 2020 Rule rendered the case moot,” the district court “found that Franciscan\nAlliance’s complaint had challenged Section 1557 in addition to the 2016 Rule, and\nconcluded that Rule 54(c) authorized the court to issue the injunction Franciscan\nAlliance now sought.” Id. Additionally, the district court determined “that subsequent\nevents showed that partial vacatur of the 2016 Rule was insufficient to remedy the\nRFRA violation.” Id. It concluded that Franciscan Alliance satisfied the requirements\nfor a permanent injunction and “enjoined HHS ‘from interpreting or enforcing\nSection 1557 . . . or any implementing regulations thereto’ against Franciscan\nAlliance  ‘in  a  manner  that  would  require  [it]  to  perform’  or  insure  gender-\nreassignment surgeries.” Id. (alterations in original) (quoting Franciscan Alliance IV,\n553 F. Supp. 3d at 378).11 \nIn November 2021, HHS noticed its appeal in the Franciscan Alliance case.\n“That same month, it withdrew the appeal in Walker and Whitman-Walker, leaving\nin place the injunctions reinstating parts of the 2016 Rule.” Franciscan Alliance V,47\nF.4th at 373.\n11In October 2021, the Franciscan Alliance district court modified its August\n2021 order to clarify that \nHHS does not violate this order by taking an of the above-described\nactions against Plaintiffs, their current or future members, or those\nacting in concern or participation with them, including their respective\nhealth plans and any insurers or third-party administrators in connection\nwith such health plans, if the agency officials directly responsible for\ntaking these actions are unaware that an entity is a member of one of the\nPlaintiffs  or  has  a  relevant  relationship  to  one  of  the\nPlaintiffs/Plaintiff-members. \nFranciscan All., Inc. v. Becerra, No. 7:16-CV-00108-O, 2021 WL 6774686, at *1\n(N.D. Tex. Oct. 1, 2021). \n-23-\n\n“In March 2022, HHS issued a ‘Notice and Guidance on Gender Affirming\nCare’  (the  ‘2022  Notice’).  The  2022  Notice  states  that  ‘[a]ttempts  to  restrict’\ngender-reassignment surgeries are ‘dangerous’ and ‘covered entities restricting an\nindividual’s ability to receive . . . gender-affirming care . . . likely violates Section\n1557.’” Id. (alterations in original) (quoting HHS Notice and Guidance on Gender\nAffirming Care, Civil Rights, and Patient Privacy, U.S. Dep’t of Health & Human\nServs. (Mar. 2, 2022), https://perma.cc/LX26-59QR (hereinafter, “2022 Notice”)).\nMoreover,  the  2022  Notice  advised  “that  HHS  ‘is  investigating  and,  where\nappropriate, enforcing Section 1557’ in ‘cases involving discrimination on the basis\nof . . . gender identity.’” Id. (alteration in original) (quoting 2022 Notice). \n“[O]n August 4, 2022, HHS filed a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (the 2022\nNPRM). This proposed rule, if adopted, would reinstate much the same approach as\nthe 2016 Rule by likewise interpreting Section 1557 to require that hospitals perform\ngender-reassignment  surgeries  .  .  .  .”  Id.  (citing  Nondiscrimination  in  Health\nPrograms and Activities, 87 Fed. Reg. 47824-01, 47871–72, 47878–79 (proposed\nAug. 4, 2022)).\nFinally, on August 26, 2022, the Fifth Circuit issued its opinion on HHS’s\nappeal of the district court’s grant of permanent injunctive relief to the Franciscan\nAlliance plaintiffs. See Franciscan Alliance V, 47 F.4th at 368. The Fifth Circuit held\nthat the plaintiffs’ APA claim was moot, the RFRA claim was not moot, the district\ncourt properly awarded permanent injunctive relief to the plaintiffs, and the plaintiffs\nhad Article III standing to seek a permanent injunction. See id. at 371.\n2. EEOC\n“Throughout the last four and a half years of fluid regulatory interpretations\nand litigation surrounding Section 1557, the EEOC’s interpretation of Title VII as\napplied to employers’ group health plans has stayed static.” Azar, 513 F. Supp. 3d at\n-24-\n\n1131 (citing R. Doc. 97, at ¶ 160). Both “before and after Bostock,” “[t]he EEOC\n. . . has taken the consistent position that Title VII protects against discrimination\nbased on gender identity.” Id.\n“In line with that stance, the EEOC has pursued enforcement actions against\nnonhealthcare employers that categorically exclude coverage for gender transitions\nfrom their health plans.” Id. (citing R. Doc. 97, at ¶¶ 156–59).\nII. Discussion\nOn  appeal,  the  government  asks  this  court  to  vacate  the  district  court’s\njudgment and remand with instructions to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction for three\nreasons: (1) the plaintiffs lack standing to challenge HHS’s and the EEOC’s “possible\nfuture enforcement” of Section 1557 and Title VII, respectively; (2) the plaintiffs’\nRFRA claims against HHS and the EEOC are not ripe; and (3) the “plaintiffs have not\ndemonstrated imminent irreparable harm sufficient to justify permanent injunctive\nrelief.” Appellants’ Br. at 3. \n“This court reviews de novo standing and ripeness determinations, and grants\nof summary judgment.” City of Kennett v. EPA, 887 F.3d 424, 430 (8th Cir. 2018).\nA “district court’s issuance of a permanent injunction” is reviewed “for abuse of\ndiscretion.” Kennedy Bldg. Assocs. v. CBS Corp., 576 F.3d 872, 876 (8th Cir. 2009).\nA. Standing\n“Article III standing must be decided first by the court and presents a question\nof justiciability; if it is lacking, a federal court has no subject-matter jurisdiction over\nthe claim.” Schumacher v. SC Data Ctr., Inc., 912 F.3d 1104, 1105 (8th Cir. 2019)\n(internal quotation marks omitted). Standing must exist “throughout the case because\nto qualify as a case fit for federal-court adjudication, an actual controversy must be\n-25-\n\nextant at all stages of review, not merely at the time the complaint is filed.” Id.\n(cleaned up).\n“The party invoking federal jurisdiction bears the burden of establishing\nstanding.” Susan B. Anthony List, 573 U.S. at 158 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n1. Associational Standing\nAs an initial matter, the government argues that “the district court erred in\nconcluding that CBA has associational standing to sue on behalf of its unnamed\nmembers.” Appellants’ Br. at 29. \nThe district court determined that CBA had associational standing to sue on\nbehalf of its unnamed members who receive federal funding. See Azar, 513 F. Supp.\n3d at 1137 (“Members on whose behalf suit is brought may remain unnamed.”); id.\n(“As for the ability of individual members to sue, the CBA’s verified second amended\ncomplaint  confirms  that  its  membership  includes  Catholic  hospitals  and  other\nhealthcare entities ‘that receive Medicaid and Medicare payments and participate in\nHHS-funded programs.’ That places at least some CBA members on equal footing\nwith the Religious Sisters of Mercy Plaintiffs.” (quoting R. Doc. No. 97, ¶¶ 55–56)). \nThe government argues that “the district court’s conclusion that ‘members on\nwhose behalf suit is brought may remain unnamed’ is contrary to the Supreme Court’s\nrequirement that an organization must identify particular members and their injuries\nin order to establish associational standing.” Appellants’ Br. at 29–30 (first quoting\nAzar, 513 F. Supp. 3d at 1137, then citing Summers v. Earth Island Inst., 555 U.S.\n488, 498–99 (2009); Ouachita v. Watch League v. U.S. Forest Serv., 858 F.3d 539,\n543 (8th Cir. 2017)). \n-26-\n\nWe  agree.  In Summers, the  Court rejected the  following  “organizational\nstanding [test]: whether, accepting the organization’s self-description of the activities\nof its members, there is a statistical probability that some of those members are\nthreatened with concrete injury.” 555 U.S. at 497. According to the Court, such a\n“novel approach to the law of organizational standing would make a mockery of [the\nCourt’s] prior cases, which have required plaintiff-organizations to make specific\nallegations establishing that at least one identified member had suffered or would\nsuffer harm.” Id. at 498 (emphasis added) (citing Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504\nU.S. 555, 563 (1983) (holding that organization lacked standing because it did not\n“submit affidavits . . . showing, through specific facts . . . that one or more of [its]\nmembers would . . . be ‘directly’ affected” by the allegedly illegal activity); Sierra\nClub v. Morton, 405 U.S. 727, 735 (1972) (“Nowhere in the pleadings or affidavits\ndid the [organization] state that its members use Mineral King for any purpose, much\nless that they use it in any way that would be significantly affected by the proposed\nactions of the respondents.”); FW/PBS, Inc. v. Dallas, 493 U.S. 215, 235 (1990)\n(noting city’s affidavit to establish standing was insufficient because it failed to name\nthe individuals who were harmed by the challenged program)). \nA  court  cannot  “accept[]  the  organizations’  self-descriptions  of  their\nmembership” because “the court has an independent obligation to assure that standing\nexists, regardless of whether it is challenged by any of the parties.” Id. at 499. “While\nit is certainly possible—perhaps even likely—that one individual will meet all th[e]\ncriteria, that speculation does not suffice.” Id. The Court explained that “[s]tanding\n. . . requires . . . a factual showing of perceptible harm.” Id. (third alteration in\noriginal) (quoting Lujan, 504 U.S. at 566). Thus, the Court “require[s] plaintiffs\n-27-\n\nclaiming an organizational standing to identify members who have suffered the\nrequisite harm.” Id.12 \nOther than the three named plaintiffs who are CBA members—the Diocese,\nCatholic Charities, and CMA—the CBA has otherwise failed to identify members\nwho have suffered the requisite harm. See id. Accordingly, we hold that the CBA\nlacks associational standing to sue on behalf of unnamed members. \n2. Standing: Section 1557\nWe now turn to whether the Religious Sisters plaintiffs and the remaining CBA\nplaintiffs have standing to challenge HHS’s enforcement of Section 1557. The\ngovernment argues that the district court erroneously concluded that the plaintiffs\nhave “standing with respect to their claims against HHS’s enforcement of Section\n1557.” Appellants’ Br. at 25. We disagree. \n“To establish Article III standing, a party invoking federal jurisdiction must\nshow (1) that the plaintiff suffered an injury in fact, (2) a causal relationship between\nthe injury and the challenged conduct, and (3) that a favorable decision will likely\nredress the injury.” Sch. of the Ozarks, Inc. v. Biden, 41 F.4th 992, 997 (8th Cir.\n2022). \n12The Court’s “requirement of naming the affected members has never been\ndispensed with in light of statistical probabilities, but only where all the members of\nthe organization are affected by the challenged activity.” Id. at 498–99 (citing NAACP\nv. Alabama ex rel. Patterson, 357 U.S. 449, 459 (1958) (all organization members\naffected by release of membership lists)). In the present case, the CBA has not argued\nthat all of its members are affected. \n-28-\n\nHere, the government “doesn’t dispute causation or redressability; thus, ‘the\nonly real question is whether [the plaintiffs] have suffered an injury in fact.’” RSM\nplaintiffs’ Br. at 30 (quoting Telescope Media v. Lucero, 936 F.3d 740, 749 (8th Cir.\n2019)).  An  individual  need  not  be  “subject  to  .  .  .  a  threat,  an  actual  arrest,\nprosecution, or other enforcement action . . . to challeng[e] the law.” Susan B.\nAnthony  List,  573  U.S.  at  158.  Pre-enforcement  review  is  permissible  “under\ncircumstances that render the threatened enforcement sufficiently imminent.” Id. at\n159. “Specifically, [the Supreme Court has] held that a plaintiff satisfies the injury-in-\nfact requirement where he alleges ‘[(1)] an intention to engage in a course of conduct\narguably affected with a constitutional interest, but [(2)] [arguably] proscribed by a\nstatute, and there [(3)] exists a credible threat of prosecution thereunder.’” Id.\n(quoting Babbitt v. Farm Workers, 442 U.S. 289, 298 (1979)). \nThe government has not contested the district court’s conclusion that “the\n[p]laintiffs’ conduct implicates constitutional interests” because their “refusal to\nperform or cover gender-transition procedures is predicated on an exercise of their\nreligious beliefs protected by the First Amendment.” Azar, 513 F. Supp. 3d at 1138.\nInstead, it argues that the district court erred in concluding that (1) “Section 1557\narguably proscribes the [p]laintiffs’ refusal to perform or cover gender-transition\nprocedures,” and (2) a credible threat of enforcement exists because the plaintiffs’\n“course of action is within the plain text of [the] statute.” Appellants’ Br. at 25, 27\n(internal quotation marks omitted). \nIn determining whether the plaintiffs’ conduct is arguably proscribed and\nwhether they face a credible threat of enforcement, we find instructive the Fifth\nCircuit’s  recent  decision  in  Franciscan  Alliance.  There,  “HHS  argue[d]  that\nFranciscan Alliance’s RFRA claims . . . bec[a]me moot because the 2016 Rule was\nreplaced by the 2020 Rule.” Franciscan Alliance V, 47 F.4th at 376. The court\nconcluded that HHS failed to carry its burden “to demonstrate that it is absolutely\n-29-\n\nclear the allegedly wrongful behavior could not reasonably be expected to recur.” Id.\n(internal quotation marks omitted). First, the court described how “the district court\ninjunctions,  the  2020  Rule,  and  the  2021  [Notification]”  proscribe  Franciscan\nAlliance’s refusal to perform or cover gender-transition procedures. Id. According to\nthe court, those sources “combined to threaten Franciscan Alliance in the same way\nthat the challenged portions of the 2016 Rule did.” Id. \nSecond, the court demonstrated how Franciscan Alliance faces a threat of\nprosecution. See id. According to the court, “HHS [recently] issued the 2022 Notice,\nwhich warned covered entities like Franciscan Alliance that refusing to offer gender-\nreassignment surgeries violates Section 1557.” Id. Furthermore, the court noted,\n“HHS has . . . repeatedly refused to disavow enforcement against Franciscan Alliance.\nIn its brief on appeal, HHS simply says it ‘has not to date evaluated’ whether it will\nenforce Section 1557 against Franciscan Alliance—in other words, it concedes that\nit may.” Id. The court rejected HHS’s argument “that the district court violated Article\nIII when it granted Franciscan Alliance a permanent injunction against hypothetical\nfuture Section 1557 enforcement.” Id. at 379. The court acknowledged that “the\n[g]overnment’s interest may subtly evolve over time.” Id. But it noted that “[i]f that\nhypothetical chance is enough to defeat standing, then plaintiffs could never obtain\ninjunctive relief to prevent future violations of the Free Speech Clause, the Equal\nProtection Clause, or any other lawsuit where means/ends scrutiny is involved.” Id.\nTo the contrary, the court pointed out, “[c]ourts have issued permanent injunctions\nin these contexts countless times.” Id. (citing Brown v. Ent. Merchants Ass’n, 564\nU.S. 786, 789 (2011) (affirming permanent injunction in a free speech case); Dep’t\nof Texas, Veterans of Foreign Wars of U.S. v. Texas Lottery Comm’n, 760 F.3d 427,\n441 (5th Cir. 2014) (same); Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pena, 515 U.S. 200, 210\n(1995) (plaintiff had standing to seek injunctive relief to prevent future violations of\nthe Equal Protection Clause); F. Buddie Contracting Co. v. City of Elyria, 773 F.\nSupp. 1018, 1033 (N.D. Ohio 1991) (permanently enjoining enforcement of local\n-30-\n\nordinance for violating the Equal Protection Clause)). HHS was unable to “cite a\nsingle case where a court refused to grant a permanent injunction because of the\nhypothetical chance that the Government could advance a compelling government\ninterest sometime in the future.” Id. at 380. The court declined “to be the first [one]\nto do so.” Id. \nAlthough the question in Franciscan Alliance was one of mootness, the court\ninvoked its standing jurisprudence to buttress its conclusion. See id. at 376 (“We have\nrepeatedly held that plaintiffs have standing in the face of similar prosecutorial\nindecision.”). “Indeed,” the court observed, “the burden of proving mootness is\nhigher than simply showing a lack of standing.” Id. at 377 n.40 (citing Friends of the\nEarth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Env’t Servs. (TOC), Inc., 528 U.S. 167, 190 (2000) (noting that\n“there are circumstances in which the prospect that a defendant will engage in (or\nresume) harmful conduct may be too speculative to support standing, but not too\nspeculative to overcome mootness”)). “Suffice it to say that if there is an ongoing\ndispute giving a plaintiff standing, the case is not moot,” the court explained. Id.\n(citing Friends of the Earth, 528 U.S. at 189–92).13 The court reviewed its prior\nstanding determination in Speech First, Inc. v. Fenves, 979 F.3d 319, 338 (5th Cir.\n2020). Id. at 377. In that case, “the defendant vaguely promised to not enforce the\n13We, too, have recognized that standing is “[a] close cousin of mootness.”\nNoem v. Haaland, 41 F.4th 1013, 1017 (8th Cir. 2022). “[T]he difference between\nstanding and mootness is merely one of ‘time frame: The requisite personal interest\nthat must exist at the commencement of the litigation (standing) must continue\nthroughout its existence (mootness).” Sisney v. Kaemingk, 15 F.4th 1181, 1194 (8th\nCir. 2021) (quoting Arizonans for Official English v. Arizona, 520 U.S. 43, 68 n.22\n(1997)). “The doctrines of standing and mootness, properly applied, ensure that\nfederal courts will decide only concrete disputes and will refrain from publishing\nadvisory opinions or judicial essays on issues of the day.” Hawse v. Page, 7 F.4th\n685, 695 (8th Cir. 2021). \n-31-\n\nchallenged policies ‘contrary to the First Amendment’—similar to HHS’s promise to\n‘comply  with  the  Religious  Freedom  Restoration  Act  .  .  .  and  all  other  legal\nrequirements.’” Id. (alteration in original) (first quoting Speech First, Inc., 979 F.3d\nat 338, then quoting 2021 Notification, 86 Fed. Reg. at 27,985). The court held that\nstanding existed because the plaintiffs “were within the ‘class whose [conduct] is\narguably restricted,’ and the defendant’s promise was so vague that the scope of\nliability was both ‘unknown by the [defendant] and unknowable to those regulated\nby it.’” Id. (alterations in original) (quoting Speech First, Inc., 979 F.3d at 338); see\nalso id. (quoting Pool v. City of Houston, 978 F.3d 307, 310 (5th Cir. 2020) (holding\nthat plaintiffs had standing to bring an “immediate[]” challenge to a city charter\nprovision where “[t]he City . . . indicated that it had not yet determined its position\non the Charter requirements’ enforceability”)). Similarly, “HHS has steadfastly\nrefused to promise that it would not enforce Section 1557 or the 2016 Rule.” Id.\nThe court also rejected HHS’s reliance on Iowa Right to Life Committee, Inc.\nv. Tooker, 717 F.3d 576 (8th Cir. 2013)—a case upon which the government also\nrelies in the present case. See id.; see also Appellants’ Br. at 24. In Tooker, “there was\nno credible threat of enforcement” because “[t]he Eighth Circuit certified the case to\nthe Iowa Supreme Court, and its opinion was ‘clear’ that the plaintiffs were not\ncovered by the statute.” Franciscan Alliance V, 47 F.4th at 377 (citing Tooker, 717\nF.3d at 585–86). By contrast, the court concluded that a “substantial reason [exists]\nto believe that Franciscan Alliance falls within the scope of Section 1557, especially\npost-Bostock.” Id. \nThe foregoing analysis supports our conclusion that the plaintiffs have suffered\nan injury-in-fact from the government’s interpretation of Section 1557. See Susan B.\nAnthony List, 573 U.S. at 158. While the government argues that the plaintiffs lack\nstanding because the 2020 Rule “rescinded” the 2016 Rule, see Appellants’ Br. at 23,\nthe Fifth Circuit expressly rejected this argument in Franciscan Alliance, see 47 F.4th\n-32-\n\nat 376. We agree with the Fifth Circuit that “the district court injunctions, the 2020\nRule, and the 2021 [Notification] combined to threaten [the plaintiffs] in the same\nway that the challenged portions of the 2016 Rule did.” Id. Collectively, these sources\ndemonstrate that the plaintiffs’ conduct—their refusal to perform or cover gender-\ntransition procedures—is “arguably proscribed” by Section 1557. Cf. FEC v. Cruz,\n142 S. Ct. 1638, 1649 (2022) (“Here, however, appellees seek to challenge the one\nGovernment action that causes their harm: the FEC’s threatened enforcement of the\nloan-repayment limitation, through its implementing regulation. In doing so, they\nmay raise constitutional claims against Section 304, the statutory provision that,\nthrough the agency’s regulation, is being enforced.” (emphases added and omitted)). \nWe also reject the government’s argument that the plaintiffs lack injury\nbecause it “has not to date taken a position on whether plaintiffs’ conduct violates the\nrelevant statutes and has not threatened any enforcement action against plaintiffs.”\nAppellants’ Br. at 2; see also id. at 16 (“The central flaw in the district court’s\ndecision is . . . [that] [t]he court enjoined the government from enforcing the statutes\nin a way that the government has not to date indicated that it will enforce them.”); id.\nat 24 (“Because the government has not to date concluded that plaintiffs’ conduct\nviolates the relevant statute, this Court should reject plaintiffs’ attempts to pretermit\nthe agency’s evaluation of the issues and obtain a preemptive judicial declaration that\nHHS may not bring an enforcement action against plaintiffs.”). As the Fifth Circuit\nexplained, the government’s assertion that “it ‘has not to date evaluated’ whether it\nwill enforce Section 1557 against [the plaintiffs]” is actually a “conce[ssion] that it\nmay” do so. Franciscan Alliance V, 47 F.4th at 376. Just as in Franciscan Alliance\nwhere the HHS “repeatedly refused to disavow enforcement against Franciscan\nAlliance,” id., so, too, has it refused in the present case. In fact, HHS has promised\n(1) “robust enforcement of Section 1557” in the 2016 Rule, 81 Fed. Reg. at 31,440;\nand (2) to “vigorously enforce [Section 1557’s] prohibitions on discrimination based\non . . . sex” in the 2020 Rule, 85 Fed. Reg. at 37,175.\n-33-\n\n  Furthermore, HHS expressly “decline[d] to adopt commenters’ suggestion that\n[it] import Title IX’s blanket religious exemption into Section 1557,” noting that\n“Section 1557 itself contains no religious exemption” and that “Title IX and its\nexemption are limited in scope to educational institutions.” 2016 Rule, 81 Fed. Reg.\nat  31,380  (footnote  omitted).  Although  the  2020  Rule  did  include  a  religious\nexemption, HHS is enjoined from enforcing it. See Whitman-Walker, 485 F. Supp. 3d\nat 64; cf. Sch. of the Ozarks, 41 F.4th at 1000 (“The [Department of Housing and\nUrban Development’s] Memorandum does not make the College’s housing policies\nunlawful without regard to legal protections for religious liberty [under Title IX].”).\nAlthough the government maintains that it “will comply” with RFRA, Appellants’ Br.\nat 24, its promise is “so vague that the scope of liability [is] both ‘unknown by the\n[government] and unknowable to [the plaintiffs],’” who are “within the ‘class whose\n[conduct] is arguably restricted.’” Franciscan Alliance V, 47 F.4th at 377 (fourth\nalteration in original) (quoting Speech First, Inc., 979 F.3d at 338). The government’s\nclaim that the district court violates Article III by enjoining “hypothetical future\naction,” Appellants’ Br. at 3, “proves too much.” Franciscan Alliance V, 47 F.4th at\n379. \nFinally, the government cannot identify a long history of nonenforcement\nagainst the plaintiffs and others like them. Cf. Sch. of the Ozarks, 41 F.4th at 1000,\n1001  (noting  that  “HUD  has  never  enforced  the  Fair  Housing  Act’s  sex-\ndiscrimination prohibition against a college whose housing policies have been\nexempted from the prohibition on sex discrimination under Title IX” and “never\nenforced the Fair Housing Act’s sex-discrimination prohibition against the College,\neven though the agency interpreted the Fair Housing Act to prohibit discrimination\non the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity between 2012 and 2020”). To\nthe contrary, the plaintiffs have cited enforcement activity in the years prior to the\nfiling of the operative complaint suggesting that the rule is likely to be enforced\nagainst them. See RSM plaintiffs’ Br. at 37–41; CBA plaintiffs’ Br. at 29–32. \n-34-\n\nFor these reasons, we hold that the plaintiffs have satisfied the elements\nnecessary to establish standing to challenge the government’s interpretation of\nSection 1557.\n3. Standing: Title VII\n“Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 bans all employers with 15 or more\nemployees—whether  receiving  federal  funding  or  not—from  engaging  in  sex\ndiscrimination.” Azar, 513 F. Supp. 3d at 1125–26 (citing 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a),\n2000e(b)). The government argues that “[t]he CBA plaintiffs have not demonstrated\nany  Article  III  case  or  controversy with respect to  their challenge  to EEOC’s\ninterpretation of Title VII and possible future enforcement efforts against plaintiffs.”\nAppellants’ Br. at 35. We disagree. \nAs the district court explained, “Akin to the Section 1557 claims, the three-part\ninjury-in-fact standard . . . continues to control. Applying that standard, the [CBA]\n[p]laintiffs’ refusal to cover gender-transition procedures in their health plans stems\nfrom a First Amendment exercise of their religious beliefs.” Azar, 513 F. Supp. 3d at\n1141 (citing United States v. Ali, 682 F.3d 705, 709 (8th Cir. 2012) (explaining that\nthe RFRA safeguards First Amendment free-exercise rights)). Further, Title VII\n“quite  clearly”  proscribes  the  CBA  plaintiffs’  conduct  under  the  EEOC’s\ninterpretation.  Id.  In  Macy,  the  EEOC  concluded  that  “[w]hen  an  employer\ndiscriminates against someone because the person is transgender, the employer has\nengaged in disparate treatment ‘related to the sex of the victim,’” in violation of Title\nVII. 2012 WL 1435995, at *7 (quoting Schwenk v. Hartford, 204 F.3d 1187, 1202\n(9th Cir. 2000)); cf. EEOC v. Fremont Christian Sch., 781 F.2d 1362, 1366 (9th Cir.\n1986) (“[R]eligious employers are not immune from liability under Title VII for\ndiscrimination based on sex.” (cleaned up)); Boyd v. Harding Acad. of Memphis, Inc.,\n88 F.3d 410, 413 (6th Cir. 1996) (“Title VII . . .  applies . . . to a religious institution\ncharged with sex discrimination.”); Rayburn v. Gen. Conf. of Seventh Day Adventists,\n-35-\n\n772 F.2d 1164, 1166 (4th Cir. 1985) (“Title VII does not confer upon religious\norganizations a license to make . . . decisions on the basis of race, sex, or national\norigin.”). \nThe government’s primary argument is that the CBA plaintiffs have failed to\nshow that “a credible threat of prosecution” exists. See Susan B. Anthony List, 573\nU.S. at 159 (internal quotation marks omitted). Specifically, it contends that the CBA\nplaintiffs have (1) never “been asked to cover gender-transition services for any\nparticular  employee”;  (2)  failed  to  show  “that  [the]  EEOC  would  likely  find\nreasonable cause to believe that unlawful discrimination occurred and then exercise\nits discretion to bring an enforcement action against Diocese or Catholic Charities\nafter a failed attempt at voluntary conciliation”; and (3) failed to show “that [the]\nEEOC has ever brought an enforcement action in district court against any employer\nto challenge the employer’s exclusion of transition procedures in its health plan, let\nalone a religious employer that has raised religious objections to such procedures.”\nAppellants’ Br. at 37, 39. According to the government, the “EEOC has not taken a\nposition on how, if at all, Title VII should be enforced against religious employers\nthat object to providing insurance coverage for gender-transition services”; the\nquestion, it contends, remains “open.” Id. at 39 (citing EEOC Compliance Manual on\nReligious Discrimination, Directive 915.063, § 12 (Jan. 15, 2001), available at\nhttps://go.usa.gov/x6bp4 (stating that the “applicability and scope of . . . defenses\nbased on Title VII’s interaction with the First Amendment or . . . RFRA[] is an\nevolving area of the law,” advising EEOC investigators to “take great care” in\nsituations involving the RFRA, directing EEOC personnel to “seek the advice of the\nEEOC Legal Counsel in such a situation,” and noting that “on occasion, the [EEOC]\nLegal Counsel may consult as needed with the U.S. Department of Justice”)). \nContrary to the government’s position, we conclude that the district court\ncorrectly determined that the CBA plaintiffs face a “credible threat” of enforcement\n-36-\n\nfrom  the  EEOC.  As  explained  supra,  the  plaintiffs  face  a  credible  threat  of\nenforcement from HHS under Section 1557; in turn, HHS has previously explained\nits coordinated effort with the EEOC to “pursue Title VII enforcement actions against\nnonhealthcare employers with gender-transition exclusions in their group health\nplans.” Azar, 513 F. Supp. 3d at 1126 (citing R. Doc. 97, at ¶ 165). “Where . . . [HHS]\nlacks jurisdiction over an employer responsible for benefit design, [HHS] . . . will\nrefer or transfer the matter to the EEOC and allow that agency to address the matter.”\n2016 Rule, 81 Fed. Reg. at 31,432. The date of filing with HHS is “deemed the date\nit was filed with the EEOC.” Id.  Additionally, “the EEOC has pursued enforcement\nactions against nonhealthcare employers that categorically exclude coverage for\ngender transitions from their health plans.” Azar, 513 F. Supp. 3d at 1131 (citing\nR. Doc. 97, at ¶¶ 156–59). Its pursuit of these enforcement actions, coupled with its\nfailure to “disavow[] any intent to enforce Title VII’s prohibition on gender-transition\nexclusions in health plans against the [religious employers],” lends further support\nto the district court’s conclusion that the CBA plaintiffs face a credible threat of\nenforcement by the EEOC. Id. at 1142.\nB. Ripeness\nHaving concluded that the plaintiffs have standing to bring their claims, we\nnext address the government’s argument that the plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate\nripeness for their challenge to HHS’s future enforcement of Section 1557 and the\nEEOC’s future enforcement of Title VII. \nRipeness is a “closely related doctrine” of standing that “originates from the\nsame Article III limitation.” Sch. of the Ozarks, 41 F.4th at 997 (citing Susan B.\nAnthony List, 573 U.S. at 157 n.5). The ripeness doctrine “prevent[s] the courts,\nthrough avoidance of premature adjudication, from entangling themselves in abstract\ndisagreements over administrative policies, and also to protect the agencies from\njudicial interference until an administrative decision has been formalized and its\n-37-\n\neffects felt in a concrete way by the challenging parties.” Id. at 997–98 (quoting\nAbbott Lab’ys v. Gardner, 387 U.S. 136, 148–49 (1967)). “[T]he complainant must\nshow both ‘the fitness of the issues for judicial decision and the hardship to the\nparties of withholding court consideration’” “[t]o demonstrate that an alleged dispute\nis ripe for review.” Id. at 998 (quoting Abbott Lab’ys, 387 U.S. at 149). A case that\n“would not benefit from further  factual development and poses a  purely legal\nquestion not contingent on future possibilities . . . is fit for judicial decision.” Id. “In\nthis case, standing and ripeness essentially ‘boil down to the same question’ . . . .”\nId. (quoting Susan B. Anthony List, 573 U.S. at 157 n.5). Therefore, it is appropriate\nfor us to “address the issue [of ripeness] in terms of ‘standing.’” Id. (quoting Susan\nB. Anthony List, 573 U.S. at 157 n.5). \nBecause we have already held that the plaintiffs have standing to challenge\nHHS’s interpretation of Section 1557 and the EEOC’s interpretation of Title VII, we\nnecessarily hold that their claims are ripe for judicial review. See id.; see also\nFranciscan Alliance IV, 553 F. Supp. 3d at 374 (“[T]he [c]ourt concludes that the\ncurrent regulatory scheme for Section 1557 ‘clearly prohibits’ Plaintiffs’ conduct,\nthus, putting them to the ‘impossible choice’ of either ‘defying federal law’ and\nrisking ‘serious financial civil penalties,’ or else violating their religious beliefs.”\n(citation omitted)). \nC. Irreparable Harm\nFinally, the government argues that the district court erred in granting the\nplaintiffs permanent injunctive relief because they failed to “demonstrate[] imminent\nirreparable harm sufficient to justify permanent injunctive relief against HHS and\nEEOC.” Appellants’ Br. at 50.14\n14“A permanent injunction requires the moving party to show actual success on\nthe merits.” Miller v. Thurston, 967 F.3d 727, 735 (8th Cir. 2020) (quoting Oglala\n-38-\n\nIn Franciscan Alliance V, the Fifth Circuit rejected the argument that “the\ndistrict court erred in granting the permanent injunction because Franciscan Alliance\ndid not satisfy the irreparable harm standard.” 47 F.4th at 380. It held “that the loss\nof freedoms guaranteed by . . . RFRA . . . constitute[s] per se irreparable harm.” Id.\n(citing Opulent Life Church v. City of Holly Springs, 697 F.3d 279, 294 (5th Cir.\n2012)). \nOther circuits are in agreement that “establishing a likely RFRA violation\nsatisfies the irreparable harm factor.” Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc. v. Sebelius, 723 F.3d\n1114, 1146 (10th Cir. 2013) (citing Kikumura v. Hurley, 242 F.3d 950, 963 (10th Cir.\n2001) (“[A] plaintiff satisfies the irreparable harm analysis by alleging a violation of\nRFRA.”); O Centro Espirita Beneficiente Uniao Do Vegetal v. Ashcroft, 342 F.3d\n1170, 1187 (10th Cir. 2003) (same)); see also Jolly v. Coughlin, 76 F.3d 468, 482 (2d\nCir. 1996) (“Courts have persuasively found that irreparable harm accompanies a\nsubstantial burden on an individual's rights to the free exercise of religion under\nRFRA.” (citing Alameen v. Coughlin, 892 F. Supp. 440, 447–48 (E.D.N.Y. 1995)\n(“[A] finding under RFRA that a regulation creates a substantial burden on an\nindividual’s exercise of his or her religion constitutes a finding of irreparable harm.”);\nLuckette v. Lewis, 883 F. Supp. 471 (D. Ariz. 1995) (holding loss of prisoner’s ability\nto practice central tenets of his religion for extended amount of time was irreparable\ninjury warranting preliminary injunction under RFRA)). \nSioux Tribe v. C & W Enters. Inc., 542 F.3d 224, 229 (8th Cir. 2008)). Once the\nmoving party shows actual success on the merits, a court “must then consider three\nfactors to determine whether a permanent injunction is warranted: ‘(1) the threat of\nirreparable harm to the moving party; (2) the balance of harms with any injury an\ninjunction might inflict on other parties; and (3) the public interest.’” Id. (quoting\nOglala Sioux Tribe, 542 F.3d at 229). Here, the government has challenged only the\ndistrict court’s conclusion that the plaintiffs failed to show the threat of irreparable\nharm. \n-39-\n\nWe agree with these courts and therefore conclude that the district court\ncorrectly held that “intrusion upon the Catholic Plaintiffs’ exercise of religion is\nsufficient to show irreparable harm.” Azar, 513 F. Supp. 3d at 1153 (citing Child\nEvangelism Fellowship of Minn. v. Minneapolis Special Sch. Dist. No. 1, 690 F.3d\n996, 1000 (8th Cir. 2012) (“CEF can demonstrate that it has a high likelihood of\nsuccess on the merits of its First Amendment claim, which is likely enough, standing\nalone, to establish irreparable harm.”)). \nIII. Conclusion\nAccordingly, we affirm the district court’s grant of permanent injunctive relief\nto the plaintiffs except to the extent it recognizes the associational standing of the\nCBA. We remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. \n______________________________\n-40-",

NATURE OFTHE ACTION\n1. Fordecades, federal nondiscriminationlawslike Title VIIandTitle IX have barred\ndiscriminationonthe basisofsex. Congresshasconsistently rejectedattemptstoexpandsuchlaws\ntocoversexual orientationandgenderidentity. The federal courtshave likewise generally refusedto\ninterpret“sex” asincluding sexual orientationandgenderidentity. Butoverthe lastfew years, the\nadministrationhassought tosidestepCongressby reinterpreting these lawsthroughexecutive\nactions: throughregulations, announcements, andevenlettersthatseek to“amend” federal civil\nrightslawscontrary toCongress’sactions.\n2. Thislawsuitconcernsthe mostrecentofsuchefforts, andthe mostconsequential\nforCatholic healthcare institutionsandevenCatholic employersmore generally: HHS’sexpansive\ninterpretationofSection1557 ofthe Affordable Care Act(42 U.S.C. § 18116)througha May 2016\nfinal regulation(“1557Rule” or“Rule”). Inshort, HHS hastakena little-remarked-uponsection of\nthe ACA thatprohibitsdiscrimination“onthe basisofsex” andturneditintoa mandate that\ncoercesCatholic hospitalsandotherhealthcare providersintoperforming, supporting, andeven\ncovering gendertransitionprocedures, andcoercesotherCatholic employers, evenCatholic\ndioceses, intocovering them.The 1557 Rule alsopreventsCatholicentitiesfromdiscriminating on\nthe basisof“terminationofpregnancy,”a phrase thatlikelycreatesanabortionmandate. HHS has\nrefusedtodeny thatthisphrase may be usedtocoerce Catholic employersintoperforming or\nfunding abortions.\n3. The 1557 Ruleappliesdirectly toa “coveredentity,” i.e., any entity thatoperatesa\nhealthprogramoractivity, any partofwhichreceivesfederal financial assistance. Asdefinedby\n4\n100021819_11\n\nCase 3:16-cv-00432-RRE-ARS   Document 1   Filed 12/28/16   Page 5 of 77\nHHS, anentity receivesfederal financial assistance whenitparticipatesinMedicaidorMedicare.\nThus, HHS believesthatitsrule coversvirtually allhealthcare providersandinsuredhealthplans,\nalong withanuncertainportionofself-insuredplans. The Rule requirescompetenthealthcare\nproviderstothemselvesdeliverorprovide, andforfull-service healthplanstocover, “gender\ntransitionservices.”\n4. Because HHS’sRule affectsnearly every insurance provider, italsoaffectsCatholic\nemployersthatare not“coveredentities.” Several Catholic BenefitsAssociation(“CBA”)members,\nincluding twoCatholic dioceses, have already beeninstructedby theirinsurersthat, due tothe 1557\nRule, nextyear’shealthplanswill includea “genderdysphoria” policy andwillcovergender\ntransitionservicessuchas:\na. Maletofemalesurgeriesinclude:clitoroplasty (creationofa clitoris), labiaplasty\n(creationofa labia), orchiectomy (removal oftesticles), penectomy (removalof\npenis), vaginoplasty (creationofa vagina), andurethroplasty (reconstructionof\nfemale urethra).\nb. Femaletomalesurgeriesinclude: bilateral mastectomy orbreastreduction,\nhysterectomy (removal ofuterus), metoidioplasty (creationofpenis, using clitoris),\npenile prosthesis, phalloplasty (creationofpenis), saplingo-oopherectomy (removal\noffallopiantubesandovaries), scrotoplasty (creationofscrotum), testicular\nprosthesis, vulvectomy (removal ofvulva), urethroplasty (constructionofmale\nurethra), andvaginectomy(removal ofvagina).\nc. Othergendertransitionservicesinclude: supportive counseling/psychotherapy\nandcross-sex hormone therapy. SeeExs. E andF.\n5\n100021819_11\n\nCase 3:16-cv-00432-RRE-ARS   Document 1   Filed 12/28/16   Page 6 of 77\n5. CatholicemployerscannotavoidHHS’smandate bybecoming self-insured. Self-\ninsuredCBA membershave beentoldby theirthirdparty administrators(“TPAs”)thatifthey wish\ntoexclude gendertransitioncoverage fromtheirplan, they mustindemnify theirTPAs.\n6. The 1557 Rulealsoprohibitsdiscriminationonthe basisof“terminationof\npregnancy.” During the rulemaking process, commenters, including the UnitedStatesConference of\nCatholic Bishops, askedHHS to“state explicitly” thatthe agency wasnotattempting touse 1557 to\ncreate anabortionmandate. HHS refused.\n7. Afterconsidering several limitationsonthe ability ofthe governmenttoimpose an\nabortionmandate, itappearsthatthismandate, atthe least, coercesgroupinsurersintoincluding\nabortioncoverage intheirpolicies.\n8. By failing toclarify thatSection1557 doesnotcreateanabortionmandate, HHS is\npressuring CBA members tocoversuch benefitsintheirgrouphealthplans, thuschilling their\nstatutory andconstitutional rights.\n9. CommentatorsalsoaskedHHS tocreate anexemptionforreligiousemployers, like\nthe exemptionunderTitleIX, onwhichthe 1557Rule wasmodeled. HHS refused.\n10. Finally, the 1557Ruleexpressly pointsbeyonditself, asserting thatwhere HHS does\nnothave jurisdictionovera givenemployer, the Equal EmploymentOpportunity Commission\n(“EEOC”)may pursue enforcementactionsunderTitle VIIofthe Civil RightsActof1964,\nemploying a similarlyaggressive definitionofsex discrimination. The EEOC hasstatedon\nnumerousoccasionsthatitnow interpretsTitle VII asprohibiting all discriminationonthe basisof\n“genderidentity.”\n11. EEOC administersTitle VIIand, therefore, hasjurisdictionovernotonly covered\nentitiesbutall employerswith15 ormore employees.\n6\n100021819_11\n\nCase 3:16-cv-00432-RRE-ARS   Document 1   Filed 12/28/16   Page 7 of 77\n12. Altogether, HHS’s1557 Rule andEEOC’sinterpretationofTitle VIIcreate an\nAbortionandComprehensive TransgenderServices(“ACTS”)Mandate thatrequiresthe following:\na. Underthe 1557 Rule, coveredentities’ healthplansmustcovergendertransition\nandabortionservices.\nb. Competenthealthcare entitiesandprofessionalsmustperformgendertransition\nprocedures, including hormone treatments, surgeries, andcounseling, aswellas\nabortions, evenwhen theybelieve the proceduresare medically unnecessary or\ninappropriate.\nc. Coveredhealthcareentitiesandprofessionals mustaltertheirspeechandadvice.\nd.

Sex-specific healthcare facilitiesorprograms—including sexual assaultvictim\nsupportgroups, showerfacilities, andhospital wards—mustbe openedto\nindividualsbasedongenderidentity.\nf.

Where HHS findsitlacksauthority toenforce itsACTS Mandate againsta given\nemployer, the EEOC mayinitiate anenforcementactionforfailure toprovide\ncoverage forgendertransitionservices.\n13. Failure tocomply withHHS’sandEEOC’sACTS Mandate exposesCatholicentities\ntosevere penalties. Coveredentitiescanbecome subjecttofines. They canbebarredfromMedicaid\nandMedicare, become subjecttotreble damagesunderthe False ClaimsAct,andresponsible\npersonsmay face upfiveyearsinprison.

These twoacts, together, are knownasthe Affordable CareAct(the “Affordable\nCare Act” or“ACA”).\n83. Section1557 ofthe ACAstatesthatnoindividual canbe deniedcertainfederally-\nfundedhealthbenefitsbecause ofthe individual’srace,color, national origin,sex, age, ordisability.\n42 U.S.C.§ 18116. However, Section1557 doesnotuse ordefine suchterms. Instead, thisprovision\nreferstoother, pre-existing lawsthatprohibitdiscriminationoncertainbasesundercertain\ncircumstances: Title VIofthe CivilRightsActof1964 (42 U.S.C.2000detseq.)(barring\ndiscriminationonthe basisofrace, color, ornational origin), Title IX ofthe Education\nAmendmentsof1972 (20 U.S.C. 1681 etseq.)(barring discriminationonthe basisofsex), the Age\nDiscriminationActof1975 (42 U.S.C. 6101 etseq.)(barring discriminationonthe basisofage), or\nsection794 ofTitle 29 (the RehabilitationAct, barring discriminationonthe basisofdisability).\n21\n100021819_11\n\nCase 3:16-cv-00432-RRE-ARS   Document 1   Filed 12/28/16   Page 22 of 77\n84. Title IX, 20 U.S.C. §1681etseq., isthe only law referencedinSection1557 thatbars\nsex discrimination.\n2. Title IX ofthe EducationAmendments of1972\n85. CongresspassedTitle IX in1972. Public Law No. 92-318, 86 Stat. 235 (June 23,\n1972).\n86. Title IX statesthatnoperson“shall, onthe basisof sex, be excludedfrom\nparticipating in, be deniedthe benefitsof, orbe subjectedtodiscriminationunderany education\nprogramoractivity receiving Federal financial assistance.” 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a).\n87. Title IX permitsdifferentiationofintimate facilitiesby sex. 20 U.S.C. § 1686.\n88. CongressspecifiedthatTitle IX may notbe appliedtoanentity “controlledbya\nreligiousorganizationifthe applicationofthissubsectionwouldnotbe consistentwiththe religious\ntenetsofsuchorganization.” 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a)(3).\n89. Congressalsostatedthat, regardlessofwhetheranentity isreligious, Title IX cannot\nbe “construedtorequire orprohibitany person, or public orprivate entity, toprovide orpay forany\nbenefitorservice . . . relatedtoanabortion.” 20 U.S.C. § 1688.\n90. Atthe time thatthe ACAwasenactedin2010, nofederal courtandnofederal\nagency hadinterpreted“sex” inTitle IX toincludethe righttoanabortion.\n91. Atthe time the ACA wasenactedin2010, nofederal courtandnofederal agency\nhadinterpreted“sex” inTitle IX toinclude genderidentity.\n92.

Title VIImakesitunlawful foranemployertodiscriminate againstemployeesor\nprospective employees“because ofsuchindividual’s. . . sex.” 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2.\n96. WhenCongresspassedTitle VII, itspecifiedthatthe law doesnotpreventa\nreligiousorganizationfromtaking religionintoaccountwithrespecttopositionsrelatedtothe\norganization’sreligiousmission. 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-1(a). Congressalsodefined“religion” broadly, to\ninclude “all aspectsofreligiousobservance andpractice, aswell asbelief.” 42U.S.C. § 2000e(j).\n97. Congressenactedthe Pregnancy DiscriminationActin1978 tofurtherdefine what\nconstitutes“sex” discriminationunderTitle VII. It specifiedthatthe terms“because ofsex” or“on\nthe basisofsex” include “because oforonthe basisofpregnancy, childbirth, orrelatedmedical\nconditions.” 42 U.S.C.§ 2000e(k).\n98. Atthe same time, CongressclarifiedthatTitle VII“shall notrequire anemployerto\npay forhealthinsurance benefitsforabortion.” Id.\n99. WhenCongressenactedthe ACA in2010, nofederal courtandnofederal agency\nhadinterpreted“sex” inTitle VIItoinclude the righttoanabortion.\n100.

AfterCongress passedthe ACA,andcontrary to congressional will,federal\nagencies unilaterally soughtto redefine sex discrimination.\n113.

None ofthese agency actionsinvolveda statute thatusedthe term“genderidentity.”\nC. HHS’s Section1557 Rule\n125. OnSeptember8, 2015, HHS proposeda new rule to“interpret” Section1557ofthe\nAffordable Care Act(ACA), toextendTitle IX’sdefinitionof“sex” toinclude “genderidentity,”\nand“terminationofpregnancy,”among otherthings. 80 Fed. Reg. 54,172, 54,216 (Sept. 8, 2015).\n126. Afterconsidering commentsmade inresponse tothe proposedrule, HHS published\nitsfinal rule underSection1557 onMay 18, 2016. 81 Fed.

The 1557\nRule expandedthe definitionevenbeyondthe proposedrule toinclude anindividual’s“internal\nsense ofgender, whichmay be male, female, neither, ora combinationofmale andfemale.” Id. at\n31,467.

Inlightofthissweeping application,HHS hasestimatedthe\nRule will “likely cover[]almostall licensedphysiciansbecause they acceptFederal financial\nassistance,” including paymentsfrom Medicare andMedicaid.14Otherobservershave estimatedthat\nthe Rule will apply “toover133,000 (virtuallyall)hospitals, nursing homes, home healthagencies,\nandsimilarproviderfacilities, about445,000 clinicallaboratories, 1,200 community healthcenters,\n171 health-relatedschools, state MedicaidandCHIPprograms, state public healthagencies, federally\nfacilitatedandstate-basedmarketplaces, atleast180healthinsurersthatmarketpoliciesthrough the\n[federally facilitatedmarketplace]andstate-basedmarketplaces, andupto900,000 physicians.”15\n129.

HHS hasissuedthismandate despite the widespread, well-documented, ongoing\ndebate aboutthe medicalrisksandethicsassociatedwithvariousgendertransitionprocedures, even\nwithinthe transgendercommunity itself. Infact, HHS’sownmedical expertsrecently wrote, “Based\nona thoroughreview ofthe clinical evidenceavailable atthistime, there isnotenoughevidence to\ndetermine whethergenderreassignmentsurgery improveshealthoutcomesfor Medicare\nbeneficiarieswithgenderdysphoria.”16The evidenceshowedthat“[t]here wereconflicting\n(inconsistent)study results—ofthe bestdesignedstudies, some reportedbenefitswhileothersreported\nharms.” Id.

Increating thismandate,HHS disregardedthe commentersthataskedHHS tomake\nclearthathealthservicesneedonly becoveredifthey are deemedtobe “medically necessary” or\n“medically appropriate” inthe professional opinion ofthose chargedwiththecare ofthe patientat\nissue. Inresponse tothese comments, HHS statedthatunderitsRule, some procedures“relatedto\ngendertransition” may berequiredeveniftheywere not“strictly identifiedasmedically necessary or\n16CentersforMedicare&MedicaidServices,ProposedDecisionMemoforGenderDysphoriaandGender\nReassignmentSurgery(June2,2016).\n31\n100021819_11\n\nCase 3:16-cv-00432-RRE-ARS   Document 1   Filed 12/28/16   Page 32 of 77\nappropriate.” Id. at31,435. Thus, underthe Rule, ifa doctorwouldperforma mastectomy aspartof\na medically-necessary treatmentforbreastcancer, itwouldbe illegal forthe same doctortodecline\ntoperforma mastectomy fora gendertransition, evenifthe doctorbelievedthatremoving healthy\nbreasttissue wascontrary tothe patient’smedical interest.\n2.

Asdiscussedabove, HHS hasconcluded, inthecontextofphysiciansoffering\n“healthservices,” thata “categorizationofall transition-relatedtreatment. . .asexperimental, is\noutdatedandnotbasedoncurrentstandardsofcare.” Id. Insodoing, HHS hasseriously curbeda\nCatholic healthcareentity’sability tomaintainpoliciesandpracticesreflectinga contrary view, even\nifsucha view isbasedonthe entity’sreligiousconvictions, conscientiousbeliefs, andbestmedical\njudgment. ThisRule thusforcesCatholic healthcareproviderstoaltertheirspeechandmedical\nadvice.\n134. Underthe 1557 Rule, HHS compelsthe speechofhealthcare institutionsand\nprofessionalsin several ways. Forexample, theRulemandatesrevisionstohealthcare providers’\nwrittenpolicies, requiringexpressaffirmationsthat gendertransition-relatedprocedureswill be\nprovided, id. at31455, evenifsuchrevisionsdonot reflectthe entity’smedicaljudgment, values, or\nbeliefs.

Thus, toavoidfacing liability forbeing discriminatory\nunderthe proposedrule, healthcare providersare compelledtospeak by revising theirpolicy to\nendorse gendertransition-relatedservices, toexpresslanguage thatisaffirming ofgendertransition,\nandtoexpressa non-binary view ofgender. Further, by treating asdiscriminatory a medicalview of\n32\n100021819_11\n\nCase 3:16-cv-00432-RRE-ARS   Document 1   Filed 12/28/16   Page 33 of 77\n“transition-relatedtreatment. . . asexperimental,”17HHS coercesCBA-memberhealthcare\nproviderstospeak aboutthese proceduresthe way the governmentwantsthemto, eventhoughthey\ndisagree, andeventhoughthey believe theyare disserving theirpatientsby concealing the\ninformationthe governmentwantsconcealed.\n3. Coveredemployers and insurance providers mustofferemployee\nbenefits coveringgendertransitionprocedures.\n135. The Rule prohibitscertainemployers, healthprograms, orinsurance plansfrom\nexercising judgmentastowhatthey cover. HHS stated, “[A]nexplicit, categorical (orautomatic)\nexclusionorlimitationofcoverage forall healthservicesrelatedtogendertransitionisunlawful on\nitsface.” Id. at31,429.\n136. Forexample, ifa doctorconcludesthata hysterectomy “ismedically necessary to\ntreatgenderdysphoria,” the patient’semployerorinsurance planwouldbe requiredtocoverthe\nprocedure onthe same basisthatitwouldcoveritforotherconditions(like cancer). Id. HHS also\nstatedthatthe “range oftransition-relatedservices, whichincludestreatmentforgenderdysphoria,\nisnotlimitedtosurgical treatmentsandmay include, butisnotlimitedto, servicessuchashormone\ntherapy andpsychotherapy, whichmay occuroverthe lifetime ofthe individual.” Id. at31435-36. As\nsuch, coverage isrequiredunderthe 1557 Rule notwithstanding the rightsofemployersthatonly\nofferemployee healthbenefitsconsistentwiththe religiousbeliefsandvaluesoftheirorganization.\n137. Thisconflictwithreligiousemployersextendsbeyondtreatmentsurrounding gender\ndysphoria, because some requiredprocedures(suchaselective hysterectomies)resultinsterilization,\nandthe 1557 Rule alsoextendsto“terminationofpregnancy.” 45C.F.R.§ 92.4.\n138. AlthoughHHS statesthatlawsprotecting religiousobjectionstoabortion(or\n“terminationofpregnancy”)apply toitsRule, HHSreadsthese protectionsnarrowly.

Thishealthbenefitrequirementofthe 1557 Rule appliestoany ofthe following\ntypesofemployerswhoreceive HHS funding: (1)any entity principally involvedinproviding or\nadministering healthservices(including hospitals, nursing homes, counseling centers, physicians’\noffices, etc.), (2)any typeofemployerwhoreceivesHHS funding forthe primary purpose of\nfunding an“employee healthbenefitprogram,” or(3)any entity suchasa university witha health\ntraining orresearchprogramthatreceivesHHS funding orFederal financialassistance forthat\n“healthprogramoractivity.”19\n140.

Reg.at31,409.\n153. WhenTitle IX—the foundationforthe 1557 Rule—wasenacted, Congressensured\nthatitprotectedandpreservedthe privacy rightsofindividualsinintimate areas. See20 U.S.C. §\n1686, 117 Cong. Rec. 30407 (1971), 117 Cong. Rec.39260 (1971), 117Cong.Rec. 39263 (1971),and\n118 Cong.Rec.5807 (1972). HHS’spredecessor, the DepartmentofHealth,Education, and\nWelfare, promulgatedregulationsguaranteeing theprivacy ofindividualsinintimate areas. See34\nC.F.R. § 106.32(b); 34C.F.R. § 106.33 (“A recipientmay provide separate toilet, lockerroom,and\nshowerfacilitiesonthe basisof sex . . . .”). ButHHS wholly disregardedany“legal righttoprivacy”\nthatcouldbe violated“simply by permitting anotherpersonaccesstoa sex-specific programor\nfacility whichcorrespondstotheirgenderidentity.”81 Fed. Reg. at31,389, 31,409.\n154. Withregardtootherhealthprograms, HHS statedthatsex-specific healthprograms\noractivitiesare allowableonly where thecoveredentity candemonstrate “anexceedingly persuasive\njustification, thatis, thatthe sex-specific programissubstantially relatedtothe achievementofan\nimportanthealth-relatedorscientific objective.” Id.at31,468.

Section1557 doesnotindependently prohibitdiscrimination, butinsteadreferences\nfourpreexisting laws: Title VI, Title IX, the Age DiscriminationAct, andtheRehabilitationAct. See\nsupra, ¶ 83.\n162.

NATURE OFTHE ACTION\n1. Fordecades, federal nondiscriminationlawslike Title VIIandTitle IX have barred\ndiscriminationonthe basisofsex. Congresshasconsistently rejectedattemptstoexpandsuchlaws\ntocoversexual orientationandgenderidentity. The federal courtshave likewise generally refusedto\ninterpret“sex” asincluding sexual orientationandgenderidentity. Butoverthe lastfew years, the\nadministrationhassought tosidestepCongressby reinterpreting these lawsthroughexecutive\nactions: throughregulations, announcements, andevenlettersthatseek to“amend” federal civil\nrightslawscontrary toCongress’sactions.\n2. Thislawsuitconcernsthe mostrecentofsuchefforts, andthe mostconsequential\nforCatholic healthcare institutionsandevenCatholic employersmore generally: HHS’sexpansive\ninterpretationofSection1557 ofthe Affordable Care Act(42 U.S.C. § 18116)througha May 2016\nfinal regulation(“1557Rule” or“Rule”). Inshort, HHS hastakena little-remarked-uponsection of\nthe ACA thatprohibitsdiscrimination“onthe basisofsex” andturneditintoa mandate that\ncoercesCatholic hospitalsandotherhealthcare providersintoperforming, supporting, andeven\ncovering gendertransitionprocedures, andcoercesotherCatholic employers, evenCatholic\ndioceses, intocovering them.The 1557 Rule alsopreventsCatholicentitiesfromdiscriminating on\nthe basisof“terminationofpregnancy,”a phrase thatlikelycreatesanabortionmandate. HHS has\nrefusedtodeny thatthisphrase may be usedtocoerce Catholic employersintoperforming or\nfunding abortions.\n4\n100895462_1\n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 44   Filed 03/29/17   Page 5 of 82\n3. The 1557 Ruleappliesdirectly toa “coveredentity,” i.e., any entity thatoperatesa\nhealthprogramoractivity, any partofwhichreceivesfederal financial assistance. Asdefinedby\nHHS, anentity receivesfederal financial assistance whenitparticipatesinMedicaidorMedicare.\nThus, HHS believesthatitsrule coversvirtually allhealthcare providersandinsuredhealthplans,\nalong withanuncertainportionofself-insuredplans. The Rule requirescompetenthealthcare\nproviderstothemselvesdeliverorprovide, andforfull-service healthplanstocover, “gender\ntransitionservices.”\n4. Because HHS’sRule affectsnearly every insurance provider, italsoaffectsCatholic\nemployersthatare not“coveredentities.” Several Catholic BenefitsAssociation(“CBA”)members,\nincluding twoCatholic dioceses, have already beeninstructedby theirinsurersthat, due tothe 1557\nRule, nextyear’shealthplanswill includea “genderdysphoria” policy andwillcovergender\ntransitionservicessuchas:\na. Maletofemalesurgeriesinclude:clitoroplasty (creationofa clitoris), labiaplasty\n(creationofa labia), orchiectomy (removal oftesticles), penectomy (removalof\npenis), vaginoplasty (creationofa vagina), andurethroplasty (reconstructionof\nfemale urethra).\nb. Femaletomalesurgeriesinclude: bilateral mastectomy orbreastreduction,\nhysterectomy (removal ofuterus), metoidioplasty (creationofpenis, using clitoris),\npenile prosthesis, phalloplasty (creationofpenis), saplingo-oopherectomy (removal\noffallopiantubesandovaries), scrotoplasty (creationofscrotum), testicular\nprosthesis, vulvectomy (removal ofvulva), urethroplasty (constructionofmale\nurethra), andvaginectomy(removal ofvagina).\nc.

Self-\ninsuredCBA membershave beentoldby theirthirdparty administrators(“TPAs”)thatifthey wish\ntoexclude gendertransitioncoverage fromtheirplan, they mustindemnify theirTPAs.\n6. The 1557 Rulealsoprohibitsdiscriminationonthe basisof“terminationof\npregnancy.” During the rulemaking process, commenters, including the UnitedStatesConference of\nCatholic Bishops, askedHHS to“state explicitly” thatthe agency wasnotattempting touse 1557 to\ncreate anabortionmandate. HHS refused.\n7. Afterconsidering several limitationsonthe ability ofthe governmenttoimpose an\nabortionmandate, itappearsthatthismandate, atthe least, coercesgroupinsurersintoincluding\nabortioncoverage intheirpolicies.\n8. By failing toclarify thatSection1557 doesnotcreateanabortionmandate, HHS is\npressuring CBA members tocoversuch benefitsintheirgrouphealthplans, thuschilling their\nstatutory andconstitutional rights.\n9. CommentatorsalsoaskedHHS tocreate anexemptionforreligiousemployers, like\nthe exemptionunderTitleIX, onwhichthe 1557Rule wasmodeled. HHS refused.\n10. Finally, the 1557Ruleexpressly pointsbeyonditself, asserting thatwhere HHS does\nnothave jurisdictionovera givenemployer, the Equal EmploymentOpportunity Commission\n(“EEOC”)may pursue enforcementactionsunderTitle VIIofthe Civil RightsActof1964,\nemploying a similarlyaggressive definitionofsex discrimination. The EEOC hasstatedon\nnumerousoccasionsthatitnow interpretsTitle VII asprohibiting all discriminationonthe basisof\n“genderidentity.”\n11. EEOC administersTitle VIIand, therefore, hasjurisdictionovernotonly covered\nentitiesbutall employerswith15 ormore employees.\n6\n100895462_1\n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 44   Filed 03/29/17   Page 7 of 82\n12. Altogether, HHS’s1557 Rule andEEOC’sinterpretationofTitle VIIcreate an\nAbortionandComprehensive TransgenderServices(“ACTS”)Mandate thatrequiresthe following:\na. Underthe 1557 Rule, coveredentities’ healthplansmustcovergendertransition\nandabortionservices.\nb. Competenthealthcare entitiesandprofessionalsmustperformgendertransition\nprocedures, including hormone treatments, surgeries, andcounseling, aswellas\nabortions, evenwhen theybelieve the proceduresare medically unnecessary or\ninappropriate.\nc.

Where HHS findsitlacksauthority toenforce itsACTS Mandate againsta given\nemployer, the EEOC mayinitiate anenforcementactionforfailure toprovide\ncoverage forgendertransitionservices.\n13. Failure tocomply withHHS’sandEEOC’sACTS Mandate exposesCatholicentities\ntosevere penalties. Coveredentitiescanbecome subjecttofines. They canbebarredfromMedicaid\nandMedicare, become subjecttotreble damagesunderthe False ClaimsAct,andresponsible\npersonsmay face upfiveyearsinprison.

Asnotedabove inparagraph39, the CBA’sEthicsCommittee, comprised\nexclusively ofCatholicarchbishops, hasthe duty andresponsibility todefine Catholic valuesand\ndoctrine onrelevantissuesforCBA members.\n89. InNovember2016, the CBA’sEthicsCommittee convenedtoaddressdoctrinal and\nethical issuesrelatedtothe ACTS Mandate.Afterconsultation, itunanimously adoptedthe\nfollowing resolutions:\na.

The ACTSMandate constitutes badmedicine\n91. Inadditiontothe religiousandethical convictionsdescribedabove, Plaintiffsandall\nCBA andCMA membersalsobelieve thattheACTS Mandate constitutesbadmedicine.\n92. Because Defendants’ ACTS Mandate hasnoage limit, itrequirescoveredentitiesto\nprovide gendertransitionservicesforadolescentsdiagnosedwithgenderdysphoria.\n93. Placing adolescentsonpuberty blockersorcross-sex hormonesmay cause\npermanentinfertility andincreasedhealthrisks.\n94. Forexample, maleadolescentsoncross-sex hormonesare ata higherrisk for\nthrombosis, cardiovasculardisease, weightgain, elevatedbloodpressure, decreasedglucose\ntolerance, gallbladderdisease, andbreastcancer.\n95. Similarly, female adolescentsoncross-sex hormonesare ata higherrisk for\nhepatotoxicity, polycythemia, increasedrisk ofsleepapnea, insulinresistance, andunknowneffects\nonbreast, endometrial, andovariantissues.\n96. These consequencesare evenmore seriousgiventhatthe overwhelming majority of\nadolescentswhoare formally diagnosedwithgenderdysphoria naturally come toaccepttheirsex\nandenjoy emotional healthby late adolescence.\n97. Evenwheregendertransitionsurgeriesare effectiveinhelping patients’ physical\nbodiesmatchtheirgenderidentity, post-surgical individualshave substantiallyhigherratesofoverall\nmortality, deathfromcardiovasculardisease andsuicide, suicide attempts, andhospitalizations\ncomparedtoa healthy control population, especially asthe yearsprogress.\n23\n100895462_1\n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 44   Filed 03/29/17   Page 24 of 82\n98. Plaintiffsbelieve thatDefendantsACTS Mandate alsodeclaresas“medically\nnecessary” a radical course oftreatmentthatthe medical professionproperly rejectswhenitcomes\ntootherpsychological conditionswhere people experience emotional distress because ofa\ndiscrepancy betweentheirself-image andthe physical reality.According toDefendants’ logic, it\nwouldbe “medically necessary” toperformliposuctiononsomeone withanorexia nervosa (belief\nthatone isobese), cosmetic surgery onsomeone withbody dysmorphic disorder(beliefthatone is\ndisfigured), oramputationsfor someone withbody integrity identity disorder(beliefthatone is\nmeanttobe disabled).\n99. Plaintiffsalsobelieve thatoptimal patientcare—including patienteducation,\ndiagnosis, andtreatment—requirestaking accountofthe biological differencesbetweenmenand\nwomen. Tocite butone example, optimal preventionofandtreatmentforheartdisease inwomen\nrequiresmonitoring fordifferentwarning signs, accounting fordifferentrisk factors, andproviding\ndifferentcounseling thanitwouldformen.\n100. Forall these reasons, the CBA andCMA andtheirrespective membersbelieve that\nproviding gendertransitionservicesiscontrary totheirreligiousandprofessional obligationsand\nconstitutesbadmedicine.\nV. THE ACTSMANDATE\nA. Statutory Overview\n1. Section1557 ofthe Affordable Care Act\n101. OnMarch23, 2010, PresidentObama signedintolaw the PatientProtectionand\nAffordable Care Act, Pub. L. 111-148, 124 Stat. 119(Mar. 23, 2010). Dayslater, the Presidentsigned\nintolaw the HealthCareandEducationReconciliationActof2010, Pub. L. 111-152, 124 Stat. 1029\n(Mar. 30, 2010). These twoacts, together, are knownasthe Affordable CareAct(the “Affordable\nCare Act” or“ACA”).\n24\n100895462_1\n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 44   Filed 03/29/17   Page 25 of 82\n102. Section1557 ofthe ACAstatesthatnoindividual canbe deniedcertainfederally-\nfundedhealthbenefitsbecause ofthe individual’srace,color, national origin,sex, age, ordisability.\n42 U.S.C.§ 18116. However, Section1557 doesnotuse ordefine suchterms. Instead, thisprovision\nreferstoother, pre-existing lawsthatprohibitdiscriminationoncertainbasesundercertain\ncircumstances: Title VIofthe CivilRightsActof1964 (42 U.S.C.2000detseq.)(barring\ndiscriminationonthe basisofrace, color, ornational origin), Title IX ofthe Education\nAmendmentsof1972 (20 U.S.C. 1681 etseq.)(barring discriminationonthe basisofsex), the Age\nDiscriminationActof1975 (42 U.S.C. 6101 etseq.)(barring discriminationonthe basisofage), or\nsection794 ofTitle 29 (the RehabilitationAct, barring discriminationonthe basisofdisability).\n103. Title IX, 20 U.S.C. §1681etseq., isthe only law referencedinSection1557 thatbars\nsex discrimination.\n2. Title IX ofthe EducationAmendments of1972\n104. CongresspassedTitle IX in1972. Public Law No. 92-318, 86 Stat. 235 (June 23,\n1972).\n105. Title IX statesthatnoperson“shall, onthe basisof sex, be excludedfrom\nparticipating in, be deniedthe benefitsof, orbe subjectedtodiscriminationunderany education\nprogramoractivity receiving Federal financial assistance.” 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a).\n106. Title IX permitsdifferentiationofintimate facilitiesby sex. 20 U.S.C. § 1686.\n107. CongressspecifiedthatTitle IX may notbe appliedtoanentity “controlledbya\nreligiousorganizationifthe applicationofthissubsectionwouldnotbe consistentwiththe religious\ntenetsofsuchorganization.” 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a)(3).\n108. Congressalsostatedthat, regardlessofwhetheranentity isreligious, Title IX cannot\nbe “construedtorequire orprohibitany person, or public orprivate entity, toprovide orpay forany\nbenefitorservice . . . relatedtoanabortion.” 20 U.S.C. § 1688.\n25\n100895462_1\n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 44   Filed 03/29/17   Page 26 of 82\n109.

Atthe time the ACA wasenactedin2010, nofederal courtandnofederal agency\nhadinterpreted“sex” inTitle IX toinclude genderidentity.\n111. The EighthCircuitholdsthatthe definitionofdiscriminationonthe basisofsex\nunderTitle IX andunderTitle VIIshouldbe “treatedinterchangeably.” Wolfev. Fayetteville, Arkansas\nSch. Dist., 648 F.3d 860,866 (8thCir. 2011).\n112. The U.S. DepartmentofJustice alsoholdsthatsex discriminationmeans\nsubstantively the same thing underTitle IX andTitle VII.4\n3. Title VII ofthe CivilRights Actof1964\n113. CongressenactedTitle VIIin1964. Public Law 88-352, 78 Stat. 241 (July 2, 1964).\n114. Title VIImakesitunlawful foranemployertodiscriminate againstemployeesor\nprospective employees“because ofsuchindividual’s. . . sex.” 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2.\n115. WhenCongresspassedTitle VII, itspecifiedthatthe law doesnotpreventa\nreligiousorganizationfromtaking religionintoaccountwithrespecttopositionsrelatedtothe\norganization’sreligiousmission. 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-1(a). Congressalsodefined“religion” broadly, to\ninclude “all aspectsofreligiousobservance andpractice, aswell asbelief.” 42U.S.C. § 2000e(j).\n116. Congressenactedthe Pregnancy DiscriminationActin1978 tofurtherdefine what\nconstitutes“sex” discriminationunderTitle VII. It specifiedthatthe terms“because ofsex” or“on\nthe basisofsex” include “because oforonthe basisofpregnancy, childbirth, orrelatedmedical\nconditions.” 42 U.S.C.§ 2000e(k).\n4U.S.DepartmentofJustice,CivilRightsDivision,TitleIXLegalManual,SectionIV.B.2,availableat\nhttps://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/crt/legacy/2010/12/14/ixlegal.pdf/.\n26\n100895462_1\n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 44   Filed 03/29/17   Page 27 of 82\n117. Atthe same time, CongressclarifiedthatTitle VII“shall notrequire anemployerto\npay forhealthinsurance benefitsforabortion.” Id.\n118. WhenCongressenactedthe ACA in2010, nofederal courtandnofederal agency\nhadinterpreted“sex” inTitle VIItoinclude the righttoanabortion.\n119. Whenthe ACA wasenactedin2010, nofederalcourtandnofederal agency had\ninterpreted“sex” inTitle VIItoinclude genderidentity.\n4. Congress has consistently rejectedattempts toexpandthe meaningof\n“sex” inTitle VII andTitle IX.\n120. Fordecades, lawmakershave proposedlegislationthatwouldexpandTitleVIIand\nTitle IX toaddthe new categoriesof“sexual orientation” and“genderidentity.” The firstsuch\nattemptwasin1974, andthere have beendozensofsuchattemptssince then. Congresshasrejected\nall suchattempts.\n121. In1974, RepresentativesBella AbzugandEdwardKochproposedtoamendthe\nCivil RightsActto add thenewcategory of“sexual orientation.” H.R. 14752, 93rdCong. (1974).\nCongressconsideredandrejectedthisbill andtenothersimilarbillsduring the 1970s. Sommersv.\nBudgetMktg., Inc., 667 F.2d 748, 750 (8thCir. 1982);Hollowayv. ArthurAnderson Co., 566 F.2d 659,\n662 n.6 (9thCir. 1977).\n122. In1994, lawmakersintroducedthe EmploymentNon-DiscriminationAct\n(“ENDA”)that, likeRep.Abzug andKoch’searliereffort, waspremisedonthe understanding that\nTitle VII’sprotectionsagainstinvidious“sex” discriminationrelatedonly toone’sbiological sexas\nmale orfemale. H.R. 4636, 103rdCong. (1994). From1994 tothe present, Congresshasconsidered\nandrejectedtwenty versionsofENDA. Seehttp://bit.ly/ENDAhistory.\n123. Beginning in2007, lawmakershave proposeda broaderversionofENDA toadd\n“genderidentity” asa protectedclassificationinthe employmentcontext. H.R. 2015, 110thCong.\n27\n100895462_1\n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 44   Filed 03/29/17   Page 28 of 82\n(2007); H.R. 2981, 111thCong. (2009); S. 811, 112thCong. (2011). Inaddition, in2013 and2015,\nproposalswere made toadd toTitle IX the newcategory of“genderidentity.”H.R. 1652, 113th\nCong. (2013); S.439, 114thCong. (2015). Notwithstanding the successorfailure ofthese\ncongressional proposals, they allaffirmedCongress’senduring understanding that“sex,” asa\nprotectedclass, refersonly toone’sbiological sex,asmale orfemale, andnotthe radical re-\nauthoring ofthe termnow being foistedonPlaintiffsandtheirmembersby the collective effortsof\nDefendants.\n124. WhenCongressredefinedthe term“sex” inthe Pregnancy DiscriminationActto\ninclude discrimination“onthe basisofpregnancy,childbirth, orrelatedconditions,” Pregnancy\nDiscriminationActof1978, Pub. L. No.95-555, § (k), 92 Stat. 2076, 2076 (1978), itindicatedthat\n“sex” discriminationoccurswhenfemalesandmalesare notaffordedthe same avenuesfor\nadvancement, i.e., whenpregnantwomenmay be legally firedornothired. Thus, thisamendment\nre-affirmedCongress’sview that“sex” referstobiological sex,andnottoanindividual’sself-\nperceptionofhisorher“genderidentity.”\n5. Congress has,inothercontexts,barred discriminationonthe basis of\ngenderidentity.\n125. Althoughithasnotdone sounderTitle IX or Title VII, Congresshasin other\nlegislationexpresseditsintenttocover“genderidentity” asa protectedclass. In2010, President\nObama signedintolaw hate crimeslegislation, 18 U.S.C. § 249, whichappliesto, interalia, “gender\nidentity.” Id. § 249(a)(2). The 2013 reauthorizationofthe ViolenceAgainstWomenAct(VAWA)\nprohibitsrecipientsofcertainfederal grantsfromdiscriminating onthe basisofboth“sex” and\n“genderidentity.” 42 U.S.C. § 13925(b)(13)(A).\n126. While Congresshasadded“genderidentity” nextto“sex” inotherareasoffederal\nlaw, ithasnotchangedthe termsofTitle VIIandTitle IX.\n28\n100895462_1\n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 44   Filed 03/29/17   Page 29 of 82\n6. Anti-abortionprovisions inorapplicable to the Affordable Care Act\n127. The text, context, andhistory ofthe Affordable Care Actreflectclearcongressional\nintentthatnogrouphealthplanisorshouldbe requiredtocoverabortion.\n128. The Actprovidesthat“[n]otwithstanding any otherprovisionofthistitle (orany\namendmentmade by thistitle). . . nothing inthistitle (orany amendmentmade by thistitle), shall\nbe construedtorequire a qualifiedhealthplantoprovide coverage of[abortion]services. . . aspart\nofitsessential healthbenefitsforany planyear.” 42U.S.C. § 18023(b)(1)(A)(i). The Actalso\nprovidesthat“the issuerofa qualifiedhealthplanshall determine whetherornotthe planprovides\ncoverage of[abortion]services. . . aspartofsuchbenefitsforthe planyear.”Id. § 18023(b)(1)(A)(ii).\n129. The Affordable Care Actitselfdoesnotcontaina restrictiononthe use offederal\nfundstopay forabortion services. Thisomissionnearly defeatedthe Act’spassage whenagroupof\npro-life Democratsinthe House ofRepresentatives, ledby Rep. BartStupak ofMichigan,\nthreatenedtowithholdtheirvotesfromthe bill. To secure theirvotes, PresidentObama issuedan\nexecutive orderthatprohibitedthe use offederal fundstopay for“abortionservices. . . , consistent\nwitha longstanding Federal statutory restrictionthat iscommonly knownasthe Hyde\nAmendment.” Exec. OrderNo.13,535, PatientProtectionandAffordable Care Act’sConsistency\nwithLongstanding Restrictionsonthe Use ofFederal FundsforAbortion, 3 C.F.R. 201 (2010).\n130. Inaddition, the WeldonAmendment—a feature ofevery appropriationsactfor\nHHS since 2005—provides, “None ofthe fundsmade available inthisAct[making appropriations\nforthe DepartmentsofLaborandHHS]may be made available toa Federalagency orprogram,or\ntoa State orlocal government, ifsuchagency, program,orgovernmentsubjectsany institutional or\nindividual healthcareentity todiscriminationonthe basisthatthe healthcareentity doesnot\nprovide, pay for, providecoverage of, orreferforabortions.” ConsolidatedAppropriationsActof\n29\n100895462_1\n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 44   Filed 03/29/17   Page 30 of 82\n2012, Pub. L. No.112-74,div. F, tit. V, § 507(d)(1),125 Stat. 786, 1111 (2011). The term“health\ncare entity” includes“a healthinsurance plan.” Id.\n131. The Affordable Care Actandthe WeldonAmendmentprohibitthe government\nfromcoercing the consciencesofhealthcare providersthatrespectthe sanctity oflife. Executive\nOrder13,535 reflectsthe federal government’slongstanding avoidance ofcoercing the consciences\noftaxpayersthatoppose abortionandgovernmentfunding ofabortionservices.\nB. AfterCongress passedthe ACA,andcontrary to congressional will,federal\nagencies unilaterally soughtto redefine sex discrimination.\n132. Forseveral decades, acrossa variety ofstatutes, federal agenciesconsistently\ninterpreted“sex” torefertobiological differencesbetweenmalesandfemales. See, e.g., A Policy\nInterpretation: Title IX & Intercollegiate Athletics, 44 Fed. Reg. 71,413 (Dec.11, 1979)(listing\n“male andfemale” 28 times, “menandwomen” 24times, and“men’sandwomen’s” 21 times);\nNondiscriminationonthe BasisofSex inEducationProgramsorActivitiesReceiving Federal\nFinancial Assistance, 34C.F.R. pt. 106 (addressing expendituresformale andfemale teams).\n133. Aslate as2008, the U.S.DepartmentofJustice wasstill arguing that“the term‘sex’\n. . . prohibitsdiscriminationbasedonthe biologicalstate ofa male orfemale,”andthat“a claim\nbasedongenderidentityortranssexuality failsasoutside the scope of[the term‘sex’].” Def.’sPost-\nTrial Br. at4, Schroer v. Billington, 577 F. Supp. 2d 293 (D.D.C. 2008)(No.05-01090). Upon\ninformationandbelief, nofederal agency interpreted“sex” toinclude “genderidentity” before 2010.\n134. Butin2010, several monthsafterenactmentofthe ACA, federal agenciesissueda\nrashofletters, memos, executive orders, andregulationsinterpreting prohibitionson“sex”\ndiscriminationtoincludeprotectionsfor“genderidentity”:\n30\n100895462_1\n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 44   Filed 03/29/17   Page 31 of 82\n135. InJuly 2010, the DepartmentofHousing andUrbanDevelopment“announceda\nnew policy. . . treat[ing]genderidentity discrimination. . . asgenderdiscriminationunderthe Fair\nHousing Act.”5\n136.

The 1557 Rule requirescoveredentitiestoprovide healthprogramsoractivitiesin\naccordance withHHS’sexpansive andunwarranteddefinitionof“sex.” Thisincludesa numberof\nnew requirementslistedbelow.\n1. Healthcare professionals mustperformor refer forgender transition\nprocedures.\n149. The 1557 Rule requirescoveredemployers, andtheirhealthcare providersand\nprofessionals, toperform (orreferfor)gendertransitionproceduresifa physicianorhealthcare\nprovideroffersanalogous servicesinothercontexts. Forexample, “[a]providerspecializing in\ngynecological servicesthatpreviously declinedtoprovide a medically necessary hysterectomy fora\ntransgendermanwouldhave torevise itspolicy toprovide the procedure fortransgenderindividuals\ninthe same manneritprovidesthe procedure forotherindividuals.” 81 Fed.Reg.at31,455.

HHS hasissuedthismandate despite the widespread, well-documented, ongoing\ndebate aboutthe medicalrisksandethicsassociatedwithvariousgendertransitionprocedures, even\nwithinthe transgendercommunity itself. Infact, HHS’sownmedical expertsrecently wrote, “Based\nona thoroughreview ofthe clinical evidenceavailable atthistime, there isnotenoughevidence to\ndetermine whethergenderreassignmentsurgery improveshealthoutcomesfor Medicare\nbeneficiarieswithgenderdysphoria.”16The evidenceshowedthat“[t]here wereconflicting\n(inconsistent)study results—ofthe bestdesignedstudies, some reportedbenefitswhileothersreported\nharms.” Id.

Increating thismandate,HHS disregardedthe commentersthataskedHHS tomake\nclearthathealthservicesneedonly becoveredifthey are deemedtobe “medically necessary” or\n“medically appropriate” inthe professional opinion ofthose chargedwiththecare ofthe patientat\nissue. Inresponse tothese comments, HHS statedthatunderitsRule, some procedures“relatedto\ngendertransition” may berequiredeveniftheywere not“strictly identifiedasmedically necessary or\nappropriate.” Id. at31,435. Thus, underthe Rule, ifa doctorwouldperforma mastectomy aspartof\na medically-necessary treatmentforbreastcancer, itwouldbe illegal forthe same doctortodecline\ntoperforma mastectomy fora gendertransition, evenifthe doctorbelievedthatremoving healthy\nbreasttissue wascontrary tothe patient’smedical interest.\n2. Healthcare facilities andprofessionals mustaltertheirspeechand\nmedicaladvice.\n152. Asdiscussedabove, HHS hasconcluded, inthecontextofphysiciansoffering\n“healthservices,” thata “categorizationofall transition-relatedtreatment. . .asexperimental, is\noutdatedandnotbasedoncurrentstandardsofcare.” Id. Insodoing, HHS hasseriously curbeda\nCatholic healthcareentity’sability tomaintainpoliciesandpracticesreflectinga contrary view, even\nifsucha view isbasedonthe entity’sreligiousconvictions, conscientiousbeliefs, andbestmedical\njudgment. ThisRule thusforcesCatholic healthcareproviderstoaltertheirspeechandmedical\nadvice.\n153. Underthe 1557 Rule, HHS compelsthe speechofhealthcare institutionsand\nprofessionalsin several ways. Forexample, theRulemandatesrevisionstohealthcare providers’\nwrittenpolicies, requiringexpressaffirmationsthat gendertransition-relatedprocedureswill be\nprovided, id. at31455, evenifsuchrevisionsdonot reflectthe entity’smedicaljudgment, values, or\n35\n100895462_1\n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 44   Filed 03/29/17   Page 36 of 82\nbeliefs. Second, itrequiresphysiciansto use gender-transitionaffirming language inall situations\nregardlessofcircumstance, andprovidesasjustone example the requirementthatmedical providers\nuse “a transgenderindividual’spreferredname andpronoun.” Id. at31,406.HHS alsoreliesupona\ntransgendermedical guidance documentstating that“[m]ental healthprofessionalsshouldnot\nimpose a binary view ofgender.” Id. at31,435. Thus, toavoidfacing liability forbeing discriminatory\nunderthe proposedrule, healthcare providersare compelledtospeak by revising theirpolicy to\nendorse gendertransition-relatedservices, toexpresslanguage thatisaffirming ofgendertransition,\nandtoexpressa non-binary view ofgender. Further, by treating asdiscriminatory a medicalview of\n“transition-relatedtreatment. . . asexperimental,”17HHS coercesCBA-memberhealthcare\nproviderstospeak aboutthese proceduresthe way the governmentwantsthemto, eventhoughthey\ndisagree, andeventhoughthey believe theyare disserving theirpatientsby concealing the\ninformationthe governmentwantsconcealed.\n3. Coveredemployers and insurance providers mustofferemployee\nbenefits coveringgendertransitionprocedures.\n154. The Rule prohibitscertainemployers, healthprograms, orinsurance plansfrom\nexercising judgmentastowhatthey cover. HHS stated, “[A]nexplicit, categorical (orautomatic)\nexclusionorlimitationofcoverage forall healthservicesrelatedtogendertransitionisunlawful on\nitsface.” Id. at31,429.\n155. Forexample, ifa doctorconcludesthata hysterectomy “ismedically necessary to\ntreatgenderdysphoria,” the patient’semployerorinsurance planwouldbe requiredtocoverthe\nprocedure onthe same basisthatitwouldcoveritforotherconditions(like cancer). Id. HHS also\nstatedthatthe “range oftransition-relatedservices, whichincludestreatmentforgenderdysphoria,\nisnotlimitedtosurgical treatmentsandmay include, butisnotlimitedto, servicessuchashormone\n1781Fed.Reg.at31,435.\n36\n100895462_1\n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 44   Filed 03/29/17   Page 37 of 82\ntherapy andpsychotherapy, whichmay occuroverthe lifetime ofthe individual.” Id. at31435-36. As\nsuch, coverage isrequiredunderthe 1557 Rule notwithstanding the rightsofemployersthatonly\nofferemployee healthbenefitsconsistentwiththe religiousbeliefsandvaluesoftheirorganization.\n156. Thisconflictwithreligiousemployersextendsbeyondtreatmentsurrounding gender\ndysphoria, because some requiredprocedures(suchaselective hysterectomies)resultinsterilization,\nandthe 1557 Rule alsoextendsto“terminationofpregnancy.” 45C.F.R.§ 92.4.\n157. AlthoughHHS statesthatlawsprotecting religiousobjectionstoabortion(or\n“terminationofpregnancy”)apply toitsRule, HHSreadsthese protectionsnarrowly. Forexample,\nHHS recently approvedCalifornia forcing all insurerstoinclude abortioncoverage, evenfor\nobjecting religiousinstitutions.18HHS thereby deniedthatthe WeldonAmendmentprotectsthe\nrightsofreligiousemployersthatwishto exclude abortioncoverage fromtheirhealthplans.\n158. Thishealthbenefitrequirementofthe 1557 Rule appliestoany ofthe following\ntypesofemployerswhoreceive HHS funding: (1)any entity principally involvedinproviding or\nadministering healthservices(including hospitals, nursing homes, counseling centers, physicians’\noffices, etc.), (2)any typeofemployerwhoreceivesHHS funding forthe primary purpose of\nfunding an“employee healthbenefitprogram,” or(3)any entity suchasa university witha health\ntraining orresearchprogramthatreceivesHHS funding orFederal financialassistance forthat\n“healthprogramoractivity.”19\n159. Thus, any suchemployerswhohave alwaysofferedemployee healthbenefitsthat\nreflecttheirreligiousorconscientiousbeliefs, andexcludedgendertransitionproceduresfrom\nemployee benefits, will now be considereddiscriminatory underthe Rule.\n18LetterfromJocelynSamuels,DirectorofHHSOfficeofCivilRightstoCatherineW.Short, etal.(June21,\n2016(availableat:https://adflegal.blob.core.windows.net/web-content-dev/docs/default-\nsource/documents/resources/media-resources/cdmhc-investigation-closure-letter.pdf?sfvrsn=2).\n19Id.at31,472,45C.F.R.§92.208;seealso81Fed.Reg.at31,437.\n37\n100895462_1\n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 44   Filed 03/29/17   Page 38 of 82\n160.

Sex-specific healthcare facilities orprograms,includingshower\nfacilities orhospital wards,mustbe openedto individuals basedon\ngenderidentity.\n171. Withregardtofacilities, the 1557 Rule statesthatevenforsex-specific facilitiessuch\nas“showerfacilities” offeredby healthcare providers, individualsmay notbeexcluded“basedon\ntheirgenderidentity.” 81Fed. Reg.at31,409.\n172. WhenTitle IX—the foundationforthe 1557 Rule—wasenacted, Congressensured\nthatitprotectedandpreservedthe privacy rightsofindividualsinintimate areas. See20 U.S.C. §\n1686, 117 Cong. Rec. 30407 (1971), 117 Cong. Rec.39260 (1971), 117Cong.Rec. 39263 (1971),and\n118 Cong.Rec.5807 (1972). HHS’spredecessor, the DepartmentofHealth,Education, and\nWelfare, promulgatedregulationsguaranteeing theprivacy ofindividualsinintimate areas. See34\nC.F.R. § 106.32(b); 34C.F.R. § 106.33 (“A recipientmay provide separate toilet, lockerroom,and\nshowerfacilitiesonthe basisof sex . . . .”). ButHHS wholly disregardedany“legal righttoprivacy”\nthatcouldbe violated“simply by permitting anotherpersonaccesstoa sex-specific programor\nfacility whichcorrespondstotheirgenderidentity.”81 Fed. Reg. at31,389, 31,409.\n173. Withregardtootherhealthprograms, HHS statedthatsex-specific healthprograms\noractivitiesare allowableonly where thecoveredentity candemonstrate “anexceedingly persuasive\njustification, thatis, thatthe sex-specific programissubstantially relatedtothe achievementofan\nimportanthealth-relatedorscientific objective.” Id.at31,468.

HHS waswellaware thatitsACTS Mandate wouldsubstantially burdenthe religious\nexercise ofcountlessreligioushospitals, churches, ministries, andotheremployers. Seeid. at31,378.\n179. During the commentperiod, many religiousorganizationsvoicedtheiralarmatthe\nscope ofHHS’sproposed rule andexplainedwhyitwasessential forHHS toinclude adequate\nprotectionsforreligiousemployersandhealthcare organizations. Forexample,the UnitedStates\nConference ofCatholic Bishopsjoinedwiththe National AssociationofEvangelicals, the Christian\nMedical Association, theNational Catholic BioethicsCenter, andotherreligiousorganizationsto\nsubmitcommentsexplaining how HHS’sproposedruleswouldaffectreligiousemployersand\nurging HHS toprotectreligiousexercise. SeeCommentsfromUSCCBetal., supra, ¶ 64 n.2.\n180. Section1557 doesnotindependently prohibitdiscrimination, butinsteadreferences\nfourpreexisting laws: Title VI, Title IX, the Age DiscriminationAct, andtheRehabilitationAct. See\nsupra, ¶ 83.\n181. HHS faithfully incorporatedthe exemptionsapplicable toTitle VI, the Age\nDiscriminationAct, andthe RehabilitationActintoitsFinal Rule. 81 FedReg. at31,470; 45C.F.R.\n§ 92.101(c)(emphasisadded):\nThe exceptions applicable to Title VI applyto discrimination on the basis of race,\ncolor, or national origin under this part. The exceptions applicable to Section 504\napplyto discrimination on the basis of disability under this part. The exceptions\napplicable tothe AgeActapplytodiscriminationonthe basisofage underthispart.\n182. However, whenitcame toTitle IX, HHS changedcourse. Unlike itstreatmentofthe\notherfourstatutescitedinSection1557, HHS refusedtoincorporatedTitle IX’sreligious\nexemption. 81 Fed.Reg.at31,380.\n183. Insteadofincorporating Title IX’sreligiousexemptionorotherwise recognizing the\nburdenthatitsrule wouldplace onreligioushealthcare providersandotherreligiousemployers,\nHHS merely statedthatreligiousobjectorscouldassertclaimsunderexisting statutory protections\n42\n100895462_1\n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-PDW-ARS   Document 44   Filed 03/29/17   Page 43 of 82\nforreligiousfreedom.Id. at31,376. ButHHS alsofailedtoprovide any mechanismby whicha\nreligiousentity coulddetermine ifitwasentitledtoany existing religiousprotectionsunderthe law.\n184. The ACTS Mandate is, inthisregard, evenmore extreme andunyielding thanthe\ncontraceptionandabortifacientmandate thatHHShascreatedbasedonanothersectionofthe\nAffordable Care Act. SeeSharpeHoldings, Inc. v. U.S.Dep’tof Health & Human Servs., 801 F.3d 927,\n933-35 (8thCir. 2015)(describing HHS’scontraceptive andabortifacientmandate).\n185. While HHS reluctantly decidedtoexempta narrowly definedgroupof“religious\nemployers” fromitsabortifacientandcontraceptionmandate, id. at933, itdeclinedtoexemptany\nreligiousemployersfromthe ACTS Mandate.\n186.

There is\nnograndfatheredgroupplanexemption fromthe ACTS Mandate.\nE. The EEOC,invokingTitle VII,willimpose many ofthe requirements ofthe\n1557 Rule againstnon-coveredentities.\n187. Althoughthe HHS 1557Rule onlyappliesdirectly to“coveredentities,” the 1557\nRule repeatedlyannouncesEEOC’spolicy toenforce a similarly broaddefinitionofsex\ndiscriminationagainstotheremployersunderTitle VII.

Catholicentitiesthatare “coveredentities” underthe 1557 Rule are subjectto\nenforcementactionsbroughtby HHS’sOffice ofCivil Rights(“OCR”). Ifthe DirectorofOCR\nconcludesthata coveredentity hasdiscriminatedonthe basisof“genderidentity” or“termination\nofpregnancy,” the Directormay require the entity totake “remedial action... toovercome the\neffectsofthe discrimination.” 81 Fed.

ACTSMandate’s effectsonCBA members that are coveredentities –medical\nservices\n210. The ACTS Mandate’sregulatory scheme makesitvirtually impossible forCBA\nmembersthatqualify asa“coveredentity” tocontinue theirhealthcare ministries. Theiroptionsare:\n(1)provide gendertransitionservices, (2)cease providing any servicesthatHHS may correlatewith\ngendertransition, (3)continue tomeetpatients’ needsbutrefuse toprovide gendertransition\nservices, (4)stopparticipating inall HHS-relatedprograms, including MedicaidandMedicare;and\n(5)cease providing healthservicesandactivities.\n211. Option1, directly providing gendertransitionandabortionservices, iscontrary to\nCatholic valuesandwouldgive rise toscandal.\n212. Directly providing gendertransitionservicesiscontrary toCatholic values.\n213. Thissituationgivesrise toscandal andthe lossofmembers’ reputationbecause\npatients, employees, andthe largercommunity wouldperceive thatCBA-memberhealthcare\nprovidersprofessone thing butdoanother. Suchscandal devastatesministry.\n214. Option2, ceasing providing any servicesthatHHSmay correlatewithgender\ntransitionandabortion, wouldbe ruinousforcoveredentity CBA membersandtheirpatients.\n215. Inordertoavoidthe ACTS Mandate, CBA memberscouldrefuse toperformany\nprocedure thatmightbe usedaspartofa gendertransition, suchashysterectomies, mastectomies,\nhormone treatments, andplastic surgery.\n216.

See Docket No. 45.  The Plaintiffs Catholic\n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-DLH-ARS   Document 56   Filed 08/24/17   Page 2 of 3\nBenefits Association, Diocese of Fargo, Catholic Charities North Dakota, and Catholic Medical\nAssociation (“CBA”) filed, in lieu of a response to HHS’s motion, a motion for additional stay of\nenforcement by the EEOC on May 30, 2017.  See Docket No. 46.  The Plaintiffs Religious Sisters\nof Mercy, Sacred Heart Mercy Health Care Center (Jackson, MN), Sacred Heart Mercy, Health Care\nCenter (Alma, MI), SMP Health System, University of Mary, and the State of North Dakota (“North\nDakota”) filed a response in support of HHS’s proposed stay but in opposition to remand on June\n9, 2017.  See Docket No. 50.  The Defendant Equal Employment Opportunity Commission\n(“EEOC”) filed a response in support of HHS’s motion and in opposition to the CBA’s motion for\nadditional stay on June 13, 2017.  See Docket No. 51.  The CBA filed a reply on June 20, 2017.  See\nDocket No. 52.  The HHS filed a notice of supplemental authority on July 12, 2017.  See Docket No.\n53.  \nThe Court has carefully reviewed the parties’ filings and agrees that a stay is warranted AND\nappropriate so that the agency can revisit Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act, codified at 45\nC.F.R. § 92.4 (“the Rule”).  A remand is unnecessary as HHS has the inherent authority to\nreconsider Rule 1557 regardless of whether there is a remand or not.  Accordingly, HHS’s motion\n(Docket No. 45) for a stay is GRANTED and its motion for remand is DENIED as moot.  The\nnationwide  preliminary injunction which enjoins the same HHS regulations remains in full force\nand in effect.  See Docket No. 36.  On July 10, 2017, the federal district court in Texas stayed that\nlitigation in the case of Franciscan Alliance, Inc. v. Burwell, Case No. 7:16-cv-108, Docket No. 105. \nThese consolidated cases in North Dakota shall also be stayed in all respects until further\nOrder of the Court in order to allow HHS to reconsider the controversial rules and regulations at\nissue.  The Court shall retain jurisdiction over all pending claims asserted, and all pending motions\nin the consolidated cases shall be held in abeyance until further order of the Court.  HHS and the\n2\n\nCase 3:16-cv-00386-DLH-ARS   Document 56   Filed 08/24/17   Page 3 of 3\nEEOC shall file status reports with the Court every ninety (90) days from the date of this order\nconcerning  all  rulemaking  proceedings  initiated  as  to  the  challenged  rule  as  well  as  any\ncontemplated enforcement actions.\nIT IS SO ORDERED.\nDated this 24th day of August, 2017.\n/s/ Daniel L.
