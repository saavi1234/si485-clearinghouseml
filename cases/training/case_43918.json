On June 14, 2023, the Mayor of the City of Jackson, Mississippi, called a press conference to announce the City's distribution of free water filters to a certain class of citizens, who might be harmed by Jackson's alleged poor water quality. The Mayor stated that these filters would be free and obtainable from United Healthcare. The Mayor further advised the public that processing efforts of the drinking water are underway, and should show improvement in a few months. This court is concerned whether the Mayor's comments comport with the progress that has been made on water quality by the efforts of the Interim Third Party Manager, Ted Henifin. Concerned, then, that the Mayor's comments may have misinformed the public as to the current status of Jackson's water quality, and the alleged \"danger\" he discussed owing to the alleged presence of various chemicals, this Court hereby ORDERS a status conference on these matters. The Mayor is hereby directed personally to attend. Additionally, the Interim Third Party Manager is also ordered to attend in person this status conference. (nd)"

          "description": "Response to Order re Set Hearing: Status Conference set for 6/21/2023 10:00 AM in Courtroom 6A (Jackson) before District Judge Henry T. Wingate. On June 14, 2023, the Mayor of the City of Jackson, Mississippi, called a press conference to announce the City's distribution of free water filters to a certain class of citizens, who might be harmed by Jackson's alleged poor water quality. The Mayor stated that these filters would be free and obtainable from United Healthcare. The Mayor further advised the public that processing efforts of the drinking water are underway, and should show improvement in a few months. This court is concerned whether the Mayor's comments comport with the progress that has been made on water quality by the efforts of the Interim Third Party Manager, Ted Henifin. Concerned, then, that the Mayor's comments may have misinformed the public as to the current status of Jackson's water quality, and the alleged \"danger\" he discussed owing to the alleged presence of various chemicals, this Court hereby ORDERS a status conference on these matters. The Mayor is hereby directed personally to attend. Additionally, the Interim Third Party Manager is also ordered to attend in person this status conference. (nd) filed by The City of Jackson, Mississippi (Attachments: # 1 Exhibit A, # 2 Exhibit B, # 3 Exhibit C)(Martin, Catoria) (Entered: 06/20/2023)"

On November 29, 2022, the U.S. Department of Justice (\"DOJ\") filed a complaint against the city of Jackson, Mississippi (\"the City\"), on behalf of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\") in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi. The DOJ sued the city of Jackson under the Safe Drinking Water Act.</p>\r\n<p>Prior to this lawsuit, in February 2020, the EPA found infrastructure problems indicating that the City was not providing drinking water that was reliably compliant with the Safe Drinking Water Act. As a result of that finding, in July 2021 the City and the EPA entered into a consent order requiring the City to make changes to move its water systems toward compliance. The DOJ's November 2022 complaint alleged that the City had failed to comply with that consent order and that its drinking water continued to pose health risks to the people served by the City's water system. The DOJ sought injunctive relief and civil penalties.</p>\r\n<p>On the same day the complaint was filed, Judge Henry T. Wingate entered an interim stipulated order appointing an interim third-party manager who would \"operate, maintain, manage and control\" the City's water system in compliance with the Safe Drinking Water Act. That manager would oversee the improvements described in the order's priority project list, abating as much as possible the conditions that were endangering the quality of Jackson's water. The improvements included, for example, winterizing the system, repairing chemical, intake, and treatment facilities, and implementing an alternative water source plan. The order required the City to fund and cooperate with the improvements. The order also stayed all litigation for six months.</p>\r\n<p>As of December 2022, this case was ongoing with litigation stayed until May 2023.</p>",

This is a civil action concerning the failure of the City of Jackson, Mississippi (“City”), \nto provide drinking water that is reliably compliant with the Safe Drinking Water Act (“SDWA”) \nto the City’s residents. \n2.  During the week of August 29, 2022, multiple raw water intake pumps failed at one of \nthe City’s two surface water treatment plants, impacting its ability to produce adequate quantities \nof water and causing a catastrophic loss of pressure in the distribution system.  As a result of this \npressure drop, many residents had no running water and thus lost the ability to use water for \nbasic safety and hygiene purposes such as washing hands, showering, flushing toilets, fighting \nfires, and washing dishes.  During this period of low pressure, affected residents were dependent \n1 \n \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-00686-HTW-LGI   Document 1   Filed 11/29/22   Page 2 of 42\n(cid:3)\n \non bottled water and other alternative water sources supplied by the City and state and federal \nagencies or procured elsewhere. \n3.  Even beyond this event and continuing through the present, contaminants are in or are \nlikely to enter the City’s public water system that may present an imminent and substantial \nendangerment within the meaning of the SDWA.  The City has also violated various specific \nrequirements of the SDWA and administrative orders issued by EPA concerning the City’s \npublic water system.  \n4.  This action thus requests relief under Sections 1414 and 1431 of the SDWA, 42 \nU.S.C. §§ 300g-3 and 300i, including to require the City to:  \na.  perform corrective measures to protect the health of residents and consumers \nserved by the City’s public drinking water system; \nb.  achieve and maintain compliance with the SDWA, 42 U.S.C. § 300f et seq., \nthe National Primary Drinking Water Regulations, 40 C.F.R. Part 141, and the \nMississippi Primary Drinking Water Regulations, promulgated pursuant to the \nMississippi Safe Drinking Water Act of 1997, Miss. Code Ann § 41-26-1 et \nseq.; and \nc.  achieve and maintain compliance with administrative orders issued under the \nSDWA by EPA on April 2, 2020 (Emergency Administrative Order, Docket \nNo. SDWA-04-2020-2300), as amended by Docket No. SDWA-04-2020-\n2300, and July 1, 2021 (Administrative Compliance Order on Consent, \nDocket No. SDWA-04-2020-2301) (collectively the “EPA Orders”). \n5.  Authority to bring this action is vested in the United States Department of Justice by \n28 U.S.C. §§ 516 and 519 and by 42 U.S.C. §§ 300g-3 and 300i. \n2 \n \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-00686-HTW-LGI   Document 1   Filed 11/29/22   Page 3 of 42\n(cid:3)\n \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n6.  This Court has jurisdiction over the subject matter of this action under 28 U.S.C. \n§§ 1331, 1345, and 1355, and under 42 U.S.C. §§ 300g-3 and 300i. \n7.  Venue is proper in this judicial district under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1391(b) and 1395(a) and \nunder 42 U.S.C. §§ 300g-3(b) and 300i(b) because the events giving rise to the claims in this \naction arose within this judicial district. \nSTATUTORY AND REGULATORY FRAMEWORK \nEPA’s Powers to Address Imminent and Substantial Endangerment to Health  \n \n8.  Under Section 1431 of the SDWA, EPA is authorized to commence a civil action and to \nissue an administrative order when it receives information that a contaminant “is present in or is \nlikely to enter a public water system or an underground source of drinking water . . . which may \npresent an imminent and substantial endangerment to the health of persons,” and where the \n“appropriate State and local authorities have not acted to protect the health of such persons.”  42 \nU.S.C. § 300i(a).  \nNational Primary Drinking Water Regulations and  \nMississippi Primary Drinking Water Regulations  \n \n9.  The SDWA was enacted to ensure that public water supply systems meet minimum \nnational standards for the protection of public health.  Under the authority of Section 1412 of the \nSDWA, 42 U.S.C. § 300g-1, EPA has promulgated National Primary Drinking Water \nRegulations (“National Regulations”) at 40 C.F.R. Part 141 to establish contaminant limitations, \nmonitoring requirements, public notification requirements, and other requirements for regulated \ndrinking water systems. \n10. The National Regulations apply to all public water systems, unless exempted under the \nSDWA.  The SDWA and National Regulations define the term “public water system” as “a \n3 \n \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-00686-HTW-LGI   Document 1   Filed 11/29/22   Page 4 of 42\n(cid:3)\n \nsystem for the provision to the public of water for human consumption through pipes or . . . other \nconstructed conveyances, if such system has at least fifteen service connections or regularly \nserves at least twenty-five individuals.”  42 U.S.C. § 300f(4); 40 C.F.R. § 141.2.  The term \nincludes “any collection, treatment, storage, and distribution facilities under control of the \noperator of such system and used primarily in connection with such system.”  42 U.S.C. \n§ 300f(4); 40 C.F.R. § 141.2. \n11. Mississippi enacted the Mississippi Safe Drinking Water Act of 1997 (“Mississippi \nSDWA”) at Miss. Code Ann. § 41-26-1 et seq.  Under the authority of this statute, see Miss. \nCode Ann. § 41-26-5, Mississippi has promulgated Mississippi Primary Drinking Water \nRegulations (“State Regulations”), codified at Miss. Admin. Code § 15-20-72.  \n12. A public water system is classified as either a “community water system” or a \n“noncommunity water system.”  A community water system is a public water system that (a) \nserves at least 15 service connections used by year-round residents of the area served by the \nsystem or (b) regularly serves at least 25 year-round residents.  42 U.S.C. § 300f(15); 40 C.F.R. \n§ 141.2; Miss. Code Ann. § 41-26-3(c); Miss. Admin. Code § 15-20-72-2.2.2.4. \n13. A public water system that is a community water system must comply with the \nrequirements of the National Regulations and the State Regulations.  40 C.F.R. § 141.1; \n40 C.F.R. Part 141 passim (imposing requirements on community water systems); Miss. Code \nAnn. § 41-26-5(2)(a); Miss. Admin Code § 15-20-72-1.1.4. \n14. Any person who owns or operates a public water system is a “supplier of water.”  \n42 U.S.C. § 300f(5); 40 C.F.R. § 141.2; Miss. Code Ann. § 41-26-3(s) (“supplier of water” \nmeans any person who owns or controls a public water system).   \n4 \n \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-00686-HTW-LGI   Document 1   Filed 11/29/22   Page 5 of 42\n(cid:3)\n \n15. A supplier of water must comply with the National Regulations and the State \nRegulations.  40 C.F.R. Part 141 passim (imposing requirements on suppliers of water); Miss. \nCode Ann. § 41-26-15(b); Miss. Admin. Code § 15-20-72 passim (same). \n16. Under the State Regulations, a Class A system is a system “with surface water treatment, \ngroundwater under the direct influence of surface water, lime softening, or coagulation and \nfiltration for the removal of constituents other than iron or manganese.”  Miss. Admin. Code \n§ 15-20-72.2.2.1(5).  “A certified class A operator shall be onsite whenever the treatment plant \nfor a Class A public water system treating surface water is in operation.  The certified operator in \nresponsible charge shall be available twenty-four (24) hours per day to address system needs and \nproblems as they occur.”  Id.; see also Miss. Admin. Code. § 15-20-72.1.1.6.11 (compelling \ncompliance with same requirement in Mississippi State Department of Health Public Water \nSupply Operations Manual). \nEnforcement of the SDWA \n17. Section 1413 of the SDWA, 42 U.S.C. § 300g-2, provides that “a State has primary \nenforcement responsibility for public water systems during any period for which the [EPA] \nAdministrator determines . . . that such State” has met various requirements, including \n“adopt[ing] drinking water regulations that are no less stringent than the national primary \ndrinking water regulations,” “implementing adequate procedures for the enforcement of such \nState regulations,” and keeping such records and reports “as the Administrator may require by \nregulation.”  42 U.S.C. § 300g-2(a). \n18. Under SDWA Section 1413 and the Mississippi SDWA, the State of Mississippi (the \n“State”) has “primacy,” meaning it has primary enforcement responsibility for public water \nsystems in Mississippi.  Under the Mississippi SDWA, the State Health Officer or the Health \n5 \n \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-00686-HTW-LGI   Document 1   Filed 11/29/22   Page 6 of 42\n(cid:3)\n \nOfficer’s designee holds the authority to “exercise general supervision over the administration \nand enforcement of this chapter and applicable rules and regulations,” “enforce the laws, rules \nand regulations governing safe drinking water,” and “perform all acts necessary to carry out this \nchapter or the federal [SDWA].”  26 Miss. Code Ann. § 41-26-7(1)(a), (h), and (k) (describing \nthe powers and duties of the “director”); see also 26 Miss. Code Ann. § 41-26-3(h) (defining \n“director”).   \n19. The Mississippi State Department of Health (“MSDH”) is the primacy agency, meaning \nthe state agency with primary enforcement authority under the SDWA.   \n20. SDWA Section 1414 authorizes EPA to issue administrative orders and bring civil \nactions under certain circumstances, independent of EPA’s emergency powers under SDWA \nSection 1431 to address an imminent and substantial endangerment.   \n21. When the EPA Administrator finds that a public water system does not comply with any \n“applicable requirement” or with any schedule or other requirement imposed thereto during a \nperiod in which the state has primary enforcement authority, the EPA Administrator shall issue \nan administrative order under Section 1414(g) or commence a civil action under Section 1414(b) \nof the SDWA.  42 U.S.C. § 300g-3(a)(1).    \n22. Under SDWA Section 1414(b), 42 U.S.C. § 300g-3(b), the EPA Administrator may bring \na civil action in the appropriate district court to require compliance with any “applicable \nrequirement” and with any administrative order issued under Section 1414(g) if authorized under \nSection 1414(a) or if requested by the state primacy agency or the state’s chief executive officer. \n23. Under SDWA Section 1414(i), 42 U.S.C. § 300g-3(i), “applicable requirement” means: \na.  any requirement of SDWA Sections 1412 (National Regulations), \n1414 (enforcement of drinking water regulations), 1415 (variances), \n6 \n \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-00686-HTW-LGI   Document 1   Filed 11/29/22   Page 7 of 42\n(cid:3)\n \n1416 (exemptions), 1417 (prohibition on use of lead pipes, solder and flux), \n1433 (community water system risk and resilience), 1441 (assurances of \navailability of adequate supplies of chemicals necessary for treatment of \nwater), and 1445 (records and inspections);  \nb.  any regulation promulgated under the sections cited above; \nc.  any schedule or requirement imposed pursuant to a section cited above; and \nd.  any requirement of, or permit issued under, an applicable State program for \nwhich the EPA has made a determination that the requirements of Section \n1413 of the SDWA have been satisfied, or an applicable State program \napproved under Section 1414. \n24. The court may enter “such judgment as protection of public health may require, taking \ninto consideration the time necessary to comply and the availability of alternative water \nsupplies.”  42 U.S.C. § 300g-3(b).  The court may impose a civil penalty for each violation under \nSection 1414.  Id.  The court may also impose a civil penalty for each violation of an EPA \nadministrative order issued under SDWA Section 1431(a)(1).  42 U.S.C. § 300i(b).   \nFACTUAL BACKGROUND \nThe City’s Drinking Water System \n25. The City’s public drinking water system (referred to herein as the “System”) consists of a \nsurface water system identified as Public Water System No. MS0250008, a groundwater system \nidentified as Public Water System No. MS0250012, and appurtenant treatment, storage, and \ndistribution facilities. \n7 \n \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-00686-HTW-LGI   Document 1   Filed 11/29/22   Page 8 of 42\n(cid:3)\n \n26. The System includes but is not limited to two surface water treatment plants—O.B. \nCurtis Water Treatment Plant (“O.B. Curtis”) and J.H. Fewell Water Treatment Plant (“J.H. \nFewell”)—a series of elevated storage tanks, and a series of distribution pipes or “lines.” \n27. The City, through its Department of Public Works, operates and maintains the System. \n28. O.B. Curtis is located at 100 O.B. Curtis Drive, Ridgeland, Madison County, Mississippi. \n29. J.H. Fewell is located at 2302 Laurel Street, Jackson, Hinds County, Mississippi. \n30. The System’s surface water system serves drinking water to approximately 143,445 \npeople and has approximately 71,486 service connections. \n31. The System’s groundwater system serves drinking water to approximately 16,555 people \nand has approximately 5,762 service connections. \n32. Therefore, in total, the System serves drinking water to approximately 160,000 people \nand has approximately 77,248 service connections. \n33. The surface water sources of the System are the Ross Barnett Reservoir, which serves \nO.B. Curtis, and the Pearl River, which serves J.H. Fewell. \n34. O.B. Curtis uses both conventional filtration and membrane filtration in parallel tracks to \ntreat water.  J.H. Fewell uses conventional filtration to treat water.   \n35. Conventional filtration treatment is “a series of processes including coagulation, \nflocculation, sedimentation, and filtration resulting in substantial particulate removal.”  40 C.F.R. \n§ 141.2. \n36. Membrane filtration is a pressure- or vacuum-driven separation process in which \nparticulate matter larger than 1 micrometer is rejected by an engineered barrier, primarily \nthrough a size-exclusion mechanism, and which has a measurable removal efficiency of a target \norganism that can be verified through the application of a direct integrity test.  40 C.F.R. § 141.2.  \n8 \n \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-00686-HTW-LGI   Document 1   Filed 11/29/22   Page 9 of 42\n(cid:3)\n \nMembrane filtration includes microfiltration, ultrafiltration, nanofiltration, and reverse osmosis.  \nId. \n37. Both treatment plants’ filtration systems utilize UV disinfection treatment on each \nindividual effluent flow to inactivate pathogens, such as viruses, Cryptosporidium, and Giardia.  \nFinished water at both plants are also disinfected using chloramines.  The treated water is then \npumped to storage tanks.   \n38. Sufficient volumes of water are required to create enough pressure within the distribution \nsystem.  When adequate water pressure is maintained in the System, the pressure exerted from \nwithin the distribution lines keeps contaminants outside the lines from entering into the System.  \nIf a plant cannot produce sufficient amounts of treated water to fill the tanks, then the System’s \npressure may be low. \n39. When inadequate or low water pressure is present in the System, negative pressure may \npull water from outside a distribution line to inside the distribution line through cracks, breaks, \nor joints in the distribution lines that are common in all drinking water systems.  This \nphenomenon is sometimes referred to as “back siphonage.”  Back siphonage can introduce \ncontaminants into treated, potable water inside the lines downstream of the water treatment plant, \nbefore the water is delivered to users.   \nProblems with the System and EPA Enforcement Efforts \nLine Breaks and Boil Water Notices \n40. The System experienced over 7,300 distribution line breaks from 2017 through 2021.  \nThese line breaks occurred at an average annual rate of 55 breaks per 100 miles of line per year.  \nBy comparison, one industry benchmark goal is no more than 15 breaks per 100 miles of line per \nyear.  The number of annual reported line breaks from 2017 to 2021 is as follows:  \n9 \n \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-00686-HTW-LGI   Document 1   Filed 11/29/22   Page 10 of 42\n(cid:3)\n \nYear  Line breaks \n2017  1627 \n2018  2085 \n2019  1226 \n2020  962 \n2021  1421 \nTotal  7321 \n \nWhile these line breaks occurred in every zone of the City, a spatial analysis of water line breaks \nconducted by EPA showed distinct areas within the City distribution systems with a high number \nof breaks, including the North Jackson and Seneca Street areas.  These areas correspond to \nlocations where small-diameter, pre-1910 cast iron pipe is still in use.  These lines are \nsusceptible to breakage due to their age and likelihood of corrosion. \n41. Controlling for corrosion is critical for lines that are susceptible to breakage and for lines, \nconnectors, or pipe fittings that may contain lead.   \n42. Since May 1, 2020, more than 320 boil-water notices (“BWNs”) have been issued for the \nSystem.  Attachment A to this Complaint provides a detailed summary of the BWNs issued for \nthe System in 2020, 2021, and 2022.   \n43. For just the surface water portion of the System, which relies on treated water from O.B. \nCurtis and J.H. Fewell, nearly 280 BWNs were issued between May 1, 2020, and October 21, \n2022.  Based on the City’s data, the City deemed 80 of these surface water BWNs “system \nwide.”  Below is an overview of the surface water BWNs by year: \n10 \n \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-00686-HTW-LGI   Document 1   Filed 11/29/22   Page 11 of 42\n(cid:3)\n \n \nTime Period  Number of  Average  Number of  Percentage of Surface \nSurface  Number of  Surface  Water BWNs \nWater  Days to Lift  Water  Attributable to Low- \nBWNs  Systemwide  or Loss-of-Pressure \nBWNs  Events \n2020  83  3.1  0  98.8% \n(May 1 to Dec. 31) \n2021  108  3.6  78  96.3% \n(Jan. 1 to Dec. 31) \n2022  88  3.9  2  97.7% \n(Jan. 1 to Oct. 21) \nOVERALL  279  3.6  80  97.6% \n \n44. Either the City or MSDH may issue a BWN.  Circumstances necessitating a BWN can \ninclude loss of pressure in the distribution system caused by distribution line breaks, decreased \nwater pressures at the entry point to the distribution system, or planned service outages.  In \naddition, BWNs can be issued as a result of water treatment failures leading to the potential for \nmicrobial contamination in the distribution system.  \n45. In Mississippi, MSDH may issue an immediate state-imposed BWN in certain \ncircumstances, including (1) when a water system loses pressure or is compromised, there is a \nsignificant probability that contamination can or will enter the system, and the operator of the \nsystem has not issued an alert or (2) a catastrophic event or natural disaster occurs.  See MSDH, \nGuidelines for Issuing a Boil-Water Notice (Dec. 1, 2016), available at https://msdh.ms.gov/\nmsdhsite/_static/resources/3850.pdf (accessed Sept. 15, 2022).  \n46. Low pressure and loss of pressure in a drinking water distribution system may cause back \nsiphonage, as described above, which may introduce contaminants, including but not limited to \ntotal coliform bacteria and other bacteria, parasites, viruses, or pathogens, to the System.  \n47. Total coliforms are a group of related bacteria, some of which are harmful to humans.   \n11 \n \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-00686-HTW-LGI   Document 1   Filed 11/29/22   Page 12 of 42\n(cid:3)\n \n48. EPA considers total coliforms an indicator of the presence of other pathogens in a \ndrinking water system, and their presence is used to determine the adequacy of water treatment \nand the integrity of a distribution system.  See Final Rule: National Primary Drinking Water \nRegulations: Revisions to the Total Coliform Rule, 78 Fed. Reg. 10,270, 10,271 (Feb. 13, 2013). \n49. Among the pathogens that may be indicated by the presence of total coliforms are fecal \ncontamination (E. coli) and waterborne pathogens (including Cryptosporidium, Giardia, \nLegionella, and certain viruses), all of which can cause diarrhea, abdominal discomfort, nausea, \nvomiting, cramps, headaches, or other symptoms, if ingested.  Other more severe illnesses that \ncan be caused by exposure to such pathogens include hemolytic uremic syndrome (kidney \nfailure), hepatitis, and bloody diarrhea.  Infection by a waterborne pathogen can also result in \nchronic conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome, renal impairment, hypertension, \ncardiovascular disease, and reactive arthritis.  \n50. Pathogens may pose a greater health risk for infants, young children, the elderly, and \npeople with severely compromised immune systems.  \n51. Turbidity is a measure of the cloudiness or opaqueness of water and is used to indicate \nwater quality and filtration effectiveness.  Turbidity in water may indicate the presence of \npathogens because particles of matter can interfere with disinfection of water and provide a \nmedium for microbial growth.  High levels of turbidity indicate the increased likelihood that \ndrinking water may contain disease-causing organisms, such as total coliforms (including E. \ncoli), Cryptosporidium, Giardia, Legionella, and other viruses, pathogens, or bacteria.   \n52. The National Regulations recommend that systems conduct “[p]roper maintenance of the \ndistribution system including appropriate pipe replacement and repair procedures, main flushing \nprograms, proper operation and maintenance of storage tanks and reservoirs, cross connection \n12 \n \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-00686-HTW-LGI   Document 1   Filed 11/29/22   Page 13 of 42\n(cid:3)\n \ncontrol, and continual maintenance of positive water pressure in all parts of the distribution \nsystem.”  40 C.F.R. § 141.63(e)(3).  Among other things, failure to heed these treatment \ntechniques can result in the presence of potentially harmful bacteria, indicated by total coliform \nsampling. \n53. The ability of the System to reliably maintain positive water pressure depends largely on \nthe City’s ability to timely complete necessary repairs and routine maintenance at O.B. Curtis \nand J.H. Fewell so that the plants produce adequate volumes of treated water.  \n54. The City has deferred critical repairs and maintenance at O.B. Curtis and J.H. Fewell and \nin the distribution system, impairing the System’s ability to maintain sufficient pressure.   \nTimeline of Recent Events and Compliance Efforts \n55. At the request of EPA Region 4 and as part of EPA’s National Compliance Initiative to \nReduce Noncompliance with Drinking Water Standards at Community Water Systems, EPA’s \nNational Enforcement Investigations Center conducted a SDWA compliance inspection of the \nSystem on February 3-7, 2020.  EPA’s investigation report was provided to the City on March \n30, 2020.  Among other observations, EPA’s inspectors noted operator staffing shortages and \noperation and maintenance issues at O.B. Curtis, J.H. Fewell, and the groundwater system.  \nEPA’s inspectors also noted turbidity exceedances at O.B. Curtis and J.H. Fewell reported by the \nCity in January and February 2020.   \nThe Emergency Order \n56. Based on EPA’s observations during the February 2020 inspection and documents \nprovided by the City—including evidence of turbidity exceedances, concerns regarding the \ndisinfection treatment of the water, and the condition of the distribution system—EPA issued an \nEmergency Administrative Order (“Emergency Order”) to the City under Section 1431, 42 \n13 \n \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-00686-HTW-LGI   Document 1   Filed 11/29/22   Page 14 of 42\n(cid:3)\n \nU.S.C. § 300i, of the SDWA effective April 2, 2020 (Emergency Administrative Order, Docket \nNo. SDWA-04-2020-2300).  In the Emergency Order, EPA determined that existing conditions \nin the System presented an imminent and substantial endangerment to persons served by the \nSystem, giving rise to the potential presence of, inter alia, E. Coli, Cryptosporidium, and Giardia \nin the drinking water.  The Emergency Order is attached to this Complaint as Attachment B.   \n57. Based on information provided by the City, information collected during EPA’s February \n2020 inspection, information provided by MSDH and the City, and information reported in \nEPA’s Safe Drinking Water Information System database, EPA determined that the System was \nnoncompliant with the SDWA, the National Regulations, and the State Regulations.  During an \nApril 28, 2020, meeting between EPA and the City held pursuant to the Emergency Order, EPA \nprovided the City with notice of and an opportunity to discuss the violations.  On May 11, 2020, \nEPA issued a Notice of Noncompliance to the City under Section 1414(a)(1)(A) of the SDWA, \n42 U.S.C. § 300g-3(a)(1)(A), for the violations, which included the City’s failure to have a Class \nA certified operator onsite at the System’s treatment plants at all times. \n58. During the April 28, 2020, meeting between EPA and the City, the City requested \nclarification regarding the implementation of the Alternative Water Source Plan required under \nthe Emergency Order.  Following the meeting, EPA issued an amendment to the Emergency \nOrder on May 28, 2020, replacing a paragraph of the Order with the text contained in the \namendment.  The amendment is attached to this Complaint as Attachment C. \n59. Under the Emergency Order, as amended, EPA required the City to take actions to \naddress the imminent and substantial endangerment and communicate regularly with EPA, \nincluding inter alia: \n14 \n \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-00686-HTW-LGI   Document 1   Filed 11/29/22   Page 15 of 42\n(cid:3)\n \na.  provide alternative water supplies to residents following specified triggering \nevents;  \nb.  develop a Comprehensive Equipment Repair Plan (“CERP”) addressing the \nrepair and/or replacement of monitoring equipment and the maintenance of \nappurtenant treatment equipment;  \nc.  address concerns about disinfection and pH treatment of the water;  \nd.  immediately repair line breaks or any cause of low pressure/loss of pressure; \ne.  take additional coliform bacteria samples in certain circumstances, such as \nwhen a line breaks or when another low-pressure or loss-of-pressure event \nlikely to cause contamination in the System’s distribution system occurs; \nf.  submit weekly updates to EPA on the City’s progress complying with the \nEmergency Order and submit operating report entries on a weekly basis; and \ng.  meet biweekly with EPA and MSDH. \n60. In April 2020, EPA, MSDH, and the City began meeting biweekly to discuss the City’s \ncompliance with the Emergency Order, including the City’s development of the CERP.  \nAttendees typically included at least EPA Region 4’s Drinking Water Enforcement Section \nChief; MSDH’s Director of the Bureau of Public Water Supply; the City’s Public Works \nDirector, Deputy Director of Water Operations, and Class A-certified operators; and legal and \ntechnical staff.  The City timely submitted an Alternative Water Source Plan for EPA’s review \nand approval.    \n61. In May 2020, EPA and the City began negotiations to resolve the City’s SDWA \nviolations through an administrative settlement agreement.  The City timely submitted to EPA \n15 \n \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-00686-HTW-LGI   Document 1   Filed 11/29/22   Page 16 of 42\n(cid:3)\n \nthe CERP required by the Emergency Order, and EPA approved an Alternative Water Source \nPlan that the City had revised in response to EPA’s comments.   \n62. In December 2020, the City submitted to EPA an updated CERP, and EPA and the City \ncontinued meeting regularly to negotiate an administrative settlement agreement.    \n63. In early February 2021, the City submitted to EPA another updated CERP. \n64. In mid-February 2021, back-to-back winter storms impacted the System, with freezing \ntemperatures causing line breaks and equipment failure due to lack of pressure.  As a result, a \nsurface water systemwide BWN was in effect from February 16 through March 17, 2021; a \ngroundwater systemwide BWN was in effect from February 18 through March 10, 2021; and \ntens of thousands of the City’s customers (primarily in West and South Jackson) were left \nwithout running potable water for several weeks.  \n65. Based on a March 31, 2021, public notice issued by the City informing the public of \nviolations of drinking water standards and requirements, EPA found that the System was \nnoncompliant with the SDWA, the National Regulations, and the State regulations.  Specifically, \nthe System exceeded the maximum contaminant level for HAA5 (a group of five haloacetic acids \nthat are a type of chlorine disinfection byproduct) in the 4th Quarter of 2020 and the 1st Quarter \nof 2021, and the City had failed to install optimal corrosion control treatment at J.H. Fewell by \nMSDH’s deadline of May 31, 2019.  The City did complete installing optimal corrosion control \ntreatment at O.B. Curtis.  On April 27, 2021, EPA issued a second Notice of Noncompliance to \nthe City under Section 1414(a)(1)(A) of the SDWA, 42 U.S.C. § 300g-3(a)(1)(A), for the \nviolations.   \n66. On April 30, 2021, an electrical fire damaged the electrical panel at O.B. Curtis running \nall five of the plant’s high-service pump lines, rendering the pumps inoperable.  The loss of the \n16 \n \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-00686-HTW-LGI   Document 1   Filed 11/29/22   Page 17 of 42\n(cid:3)\n \npumps caused multiple elevated tanks to be low or empty and caused certain areas of the \ndistribution system to have sustained low pressure.  As a result, the City issued a surface water \nsystemwide BWN on April 30, 2021 that lasted through May 3, 2021. \n67. On May 4, 2021, the Federal Emergency Management Agency approved a Major \nEmergency Declaration for Mississippi, including portions of Jackson in Hinds County, for the \nimpacts from the winter storms.  \nThe Consent Order \n68. Throughout 2021, EPA and the City continued negotiating an administrative settlement \nagreement, culminating in the EPA and the City entering into an Administrative Compliance \nOrder on Consent (“Consent Order”) under Section 1414(g) of the SDWA, 42 U.S.C. § 300g-\n3(g), effective July 1, 2021 (Docket No. SDWA-04-2020-2301).  The Consent Order is attached \nto this Complaint as Attachment D. \n69. Under the Consent Order, the City agreed to inter alia:  \na.  provide EPA with a Comprehensive Staffing Plan within 30 days (i.e., by \nJuly 31, 2021) that identified “how [the City] will ensure that a Class A \noperator is onsite [at O.B. Curtis and J.H. Fewell] at all times, including any \nbackup plans in case staff are unavailable,” Consent Order ¶ 39; and \nb.  implement the tasks described in the City’s Comprehensive Equipment Repair \nPlan as approved by EPA and attached as Appendix A to the Consent Order in \naccordance with the schedules of implementation therein, id. ¶ 40, including: \ni.  hiring two new operators for O.B. Curtis who would both be eligible \nfor licensure and would complete the Class A operator test within \n17 \n \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-00686-HTW-LGI   Document 1   Filed 11/29/22   Page 18 of 42\n(cid:3)\n \nseven months (i.e., by February 1, 2022), see Comprehensive \nEquipment Repair Plan, task nos. 2 and 3;  \nii.  within 60 days, developing a scope of work with timeframes for \nreturning the filters at J.H. Fewell to fully operational and functional \nstatus, see id., task no. 6; and \niii.  repairing and rehabilitating the conventional and membrane filtration \nsystems at O.B. Curtis, including completing within seven months all \nrepairs to the conventional filtration system so that it would be fully \nfunctional and operational, see id., task no. 13. \n70. In September 2021, EPA, MSDH, and the City began meeting biweekly to discuss the \nCity’s compliance with the Consent Order and any situational changes.  Attendees typically \nincluded at least EPA Region 4’s Drinking Water Enforcement Section Chief; MSDH’s Director \nof the Bureau of Public Water Supply; the City’s Public Works Director, Deputy Director of \nWater Operations, and Class A-certified operators; and legal and technical staff. \n71. On November 8, 2021, MSDH conducted its annual sanitary survey of the System and \nnoted as a significant deficiency that the O.B. Curtis high-service pumps remained out of service \nfollowing the April 2021 electrical panel fire, with no target date to return the pumps to service.  \nSee 40 C.F.R. § 141.2 (defining “sanitary survey” as an onsite review to evaluate the adequacy of \nthe water sources, facilities, equipment, operation, and maintenance of a public water system for \nproducing and distributing safe drinking water).  MSDH required the City to provide MSDH \nwith a written response identifying corrective actions and timeframes by January 14, 2022, and \nthat the City complete the corrective actions within 120 days of receipt of the report, i.e., no later \nthan April 14, 2022. \n18 \n \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-00686-HTW-LGI   Document 1   Filed 11/29/22   Page 19 of 42\n(cid:3)\n \n72. On November 13, 2021, the City shut down O.B. Curtis due to chemical feed issues with \nthe aluminum chlorohydrate process, which then caused low water pressure and issuance of a \nsurface water systemwide BWN that lasted from November 15 through November 19, 2021. \n73. On November 15, 2021, as part of a multi-state tour to spotlight environmental justice \nconcerns in historically marginalized communities, the EPA Administrator visited Jackson, \nwhere he inter alia met with the Mayor, toured O.B. Curtis, and met with administrators and \nstudents of an elementary school that was closed at the time because of low water pressure. \n74. On November 23, 2021, the City Council passed pay raises for drinking water treatment \nplant operators and increased water utility usage rates by 20%. \n75. On January 19, 2022, the Mayor and the City’s Chief Financial Officer met with the EPA \nAdministrator in Washington, D.C., to discuss inter alia the City’s water infrastructure needs and \nBipartisan Infrastructure Law funding. \n76. On January 24, 2022, the EPA Administrator sent letters to the Mayor and to the \nGovernor of Mississippi outlining EPA’s prerogatives for the City’s drinking water system and \nthe State’s role in assisting the City to achieve compliance. \n77. On January 25, 2022, EPA issued a third Notice of Noncompliance to the City under \nSection 1414(a)(1)(A) of the SDWA, 42 U.S.C. § 300g-3(a)(1)(A).  EPA found that the System \nwas noncompliant with the SDWA, the National Regulations, and the State regulations because \nthe City had yet to repair or replace the electrical panel at O.B. Curtis to restore the pumps to \nservice, and because the City had not provided the required written response identifying \ncorrective actions and timeframes to do so.  \n19 \n \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-00686-HTW-LGI   Document 1   Filed 11/29/22   Page 20 of 42\n(cid:3)\n \n78. In February 2022, EPA coordinated with the Department of Homeland Security to obtain \na commitment from the manufacturer of the electrical panel to expedite delivery of a replacement \npanel, and in mid-April 2022, the new electrical panel was installed at O.B. Curtis. \n79. During the week of March 2, 2022, EPA Region 4, EPA’s Technical Support Center, \nEPA’s contractors, and MSDH visited the City to gather information and assess the City’s water \ndistribution system. \n80. On March 18, 2022, the EPA Administrator sent letters to the Mayor and to the Governor \nof Mississippi, noting the availability of federal infrastructure funds under the Bipartisan \nInfrastructure Law. \n81. On April 20, 2022, a water hammer—a sudden surge of water pressure when water flow \nquickly changes direction or is stopped, such as when a valve suddenly closes or a pump \nsuddenly shuts down—caused a pipe to break in the O.B. Curtis potassium permanganate room, \ncausing the plant to shut down and the System’s water pressure to fall. \n82. On April 21, 2022, during a regular biweekly meeting among the City, MSDH, and EPA, \nthe City estimated vacancies for five operators and at least a half-dozen maintenance workers \nacross both plants.  The City’s timesheets indicated that two operator supervisors at both plants \nwere working a combined average of 128 hours per week. \n83. In late June 2022, the City began having difficulty producing water from O.B. Curtis \nbecause of equipment failures and inadequate maintenance related to the membrane filters, and \nthe System became unable to fill elevated storage tanks throughout the System, thereby lowering \nwater pressure.  The City issued a water conservation advisory on June 21, 2022, to customers \nthat they should conserve the use of water. \n20 \n \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-00686-HTW-LGI   Document 1   Filed 11/29/22   Page 21 of 42\n(cid:3)\n \n84. On June 24, 2022, as a result of high turbidity levels and the continued water production \nissues at O.B. Curtis, the City issued a Systemwide BWN for all customers of both the surface \nwater and groundwater systems.  This BWN stayed in effect for two weeks while City staff \naddressed production and turbidity issues.  That same day, the City began providing limited \nquantities of bottled water on a first-come, first-served basis. \n85. On June 30, 2022, due to the ongoing high turbidity levels, MSDH issued a surface water \nsystemwide BWN, supplementing the City’s June 24, 2022 notice. \n86. On July 9, 2022, with the concurrence of MSDH, the City lifted the BWN. \n87. In July 2022, EPA issued the report “City of Jackson Distribution System Assessment: \nSummary of Findings and Assessment Team Recommendations” (“July 2022 Assessment”), \nstemming from the March 2022 distribution system assessment and site visit conducted by EPA \nRegion 4, EPA’s Technical Support Center, EPA’s contractor, and MSDH.  Of particular \nrelevance to the claims in this Complaint, the many issues with the System identified in the \nAssessment included: \na.  The System has an extensive history of line breaks;  \nb.  The City does not collect and record continuous pressure data, which could be \nused to identify areas in need of pressure improvements to prevent \ncontamination in the distribution system, id. at 6; \nc.  The City failed to consistently meet water quality parameters for pH and \nalkalinity, id. at 10; \nd.  The City does not perform routine flushing of the distribution system, which \ncan be utilized to reduce water age (i.e., the amount of time for water to travel \nfrom its source to the user) and optimize chlorine residuals, id. at 6; \n21 \n \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-00686-HTW-LGI   Document 1   Filed 11/29/22   Page 22 of 42\n(cid:3)\n \ne.  There were infrequent cycling of storage tanks and poor mixing performance \nratios, suggesting insufficient chlorine residuals in the system, id. at 7, and a \ndisruption in the chloramine process control, id. at 10;  \nf.  The monochloramine residual in the O.B. Curtis effluent was at times less \nthan the optimization goal, id. at 10-11;  \ng.  There were considerable staffing problems, including: \ni.  the Utilities Manager position was vacant at the time of the visit, \nwhich the City explained was due to budget limitations, id. at 11; \nii.  there are insufficient operators to consistently staff three shifts, seven \ndays per week; staff are unable to take time off without forcing \nremaining staff to work extra hours; supervisors are working shifts in \naddition to their managerial responsibilities; and distribution system \ncrews are sparsely staffed and are unable to conduct preventive \nmaintenance, id. at 12; \niii.  operator turnover is high, and operators indicated instances of working \nup to 75 hours per week without receiving overtime pay, id.; and  \niv.  the utility does not have adequate plant and distribution system staff to \nperform preventative maintenance that could reduce overall \noperational costs of the system, id.; and \nh.  Various water billing and metering issues persist and contribute to the City’s \nloss of water-billing revenue (32 percent decrease since 2016) and loss of \nlarge customers (i.e., hospitals and local schools), id. at 12-13. \n22 \n \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-00686-HTW-LGI   Document 1   Filed 11/29/22   Page 23 of 42\n(cid:3)\n \n88. On July 29, 2022, MSDH issued a surface water systemwide BWN.  The next day, the \nCity issued its own surface water systemwide BWN.  According to MSDH’s notice,  \n[w]ater samples collected 7/28/2022 showed turbidity levels of 1.0 to 2.5 turbidity \nunits.  This is above the standard of 0.30 turbidity units.  Due to these high levels \nof turbidity, there is an increased chance that the water may contain disease-\ncausing organisms. . . . Turbidity has no health effects.  However, turbidity can \ninterfere with disinfection and provide a medium for microbial growth.  Turbidity \nmay indicate the presence of disease-causing organisms.  These organisms \ninclude bacteria, viruses, and parasites, which can cause symptoms such as \nnausea, cramps, diarrhea, and associated headaches.  \n \n89. Since EPA’s initial inspection of the City’s public drinking water system in February \n2020, EPA has communicated regularly with the City to enforce SDWA compliance and \nprovided assistance, including providing ongoing assistance from EPA’s Compliance Advisor \nprogram; providing financial technical assistance and analysis from EPA’s contractor; requesting \ndocuments and further information; and holding meetings between EPA and the City, including \nbetween EPA Region 4’s Enforcement and Compliance Assurance Division Director and the \nMayor. \nComplete Loss of Water Use in August and September 2022 \n90. During the week of August 8, 2022, multiple raw water intake pumps failed at O.B. \nCurtis, impacting its ability to produce adequate quantities of water and causing a loss of \npressure in the distribution system.  In mid- to late August 2022, the City experienced record \nrainfalls, resulting in what has been reported as the second wettest August on record for the City \nof Jackson.  Flooding exacerbated the pre-existing problems at O.B. Curtis by disturbing the \nwater treatment process, clogging the filters, and preventing O.B. Curtis from producing potable \nwater that could fill storage tanks and establish adequate water pressure in the distribution \nsystem.  As a result of the decreased water pressure, many System users had no running water \n23 \n \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-00686-HTW-LGI   Document 1   Filed 11/29/22   Page 24 of 42\n(cid:3)\n \nand thus lost the ability to use water for basic safety and hygiene purposes such as washing \nhands, showering, flushing toilets, fighting fires, and washing dishes. \n91. During the period of low pressure, many System users were dependent on alternative \nwater sources supplied by the City and State and federal agencies or procured from other \nsources.  \n92. On August 29, 2022, the Mayor signed a Mayoral Proclamation of Local Emergency \nunder Section 33-15-17(d) of the Mississippi Code of 1972, as amended, which defines an \nemergency as “any occurrence, or threat thereof, whether natural, technological, or man-made, in \nwar or in peace, which results or may result in substantial injury or harm to the population or \nsubstantial damage to or loss of property,” Miss. Code Ann. § 33-15-5(h). \n93. In proclaiming the existence of a local emergency, the Mayoral Proclamation referenced \ninter alia the March 27, 2020, SDWA Emergency Administrative Order and the July 1, 2021, \nSDWA Administrative Order on Consent. \n94. On August 30, 2022, the Mississippi Governor issued Executive Order No. 1564 \nproclaiming under the State Constitution and Section 33-15-11(b)(17) of the Mississippi Code \nthat “a State of Emergency exists in the City of Jackson, Mississippi and the surrounding areas of \nHinds County that receive water from [O.B. Curtis] as a result of the total or near total loss of \nwater pressure throughout that area” and ordering the deployment of the Mississippi National \nGuard to further response and recovery efforts.  \n95. On August 30, 2022, the President of the United States declared that an emergency exists \nin the State of Mississippi and ordered Federal assistance to supplement the State’s response \nefforts due to the emergency conditions resulting from the water crisis.  The President’s action \nauthorized the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to coordinate all disaster relief \n24 \n \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-00686-HTW-LGI   Document 1   Filed 11/29/22   Page 25 of 42\n(cid:3)\n \nefforts which have the purpose of alleviating the hardship and suffering caused by the emergency \non the local population, and to provide appropriate assistance for required emergency measures \nto save lives and to protect property and public health and safety, and to lessen or avert the threat \nof a catastrophe in Hinds County.  \n96. FEMA, EPA, and the United States Army Corps of Engineers have deployed to Jackson \nemergency responders, drinking water infrastructure experts, and others to respond to the \nemergency situation on the ground. \n97. The State of Mississippi has taken various actions to address the existing emergency \ncircumstances, including issuing an emergency order from MSDH (the “MSDH Emergency \nOrder”) to the City on August 30, 2022.  By its terms, the MSDH Emergency Order is in effect \nfor not more than 120 days (i.e., no later than December 28, 2022), subject to 30-day extensions \nby the State Health Officer.   \n98. Among other things, the MSDH Emergency Order provides: \nNotwithstanding the requirements of this Order, the City of Jackson shall continue to be \nresponsible for compliance with the Safe Drinking Water Act [and] any U.S. EPA \nEmergency Administrative Orders . . . .  Compliance with this Order shall not in any way \nbe construed to relieve the City of Jackson from its obligations to comply with all \nprovisions of federal, state, or local law. \n \n99. Pursuant to the emergency declarations, a Unified Command consisting of \nrepresentatives from the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency, MSDH, the City, EPA, \nFEMA, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers have taken a number of actions to restore and \nsustain water service to the City’s customers, including but not limited to: \na.  reestablishing raw water flow at both plants; \nb.  restoring water tank levels and produced water volumes from both plants; \n25 \n \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-00686-HTW-LGI   Document 1   Filed 11/29/22   Page 26 of 42\n(cid:3)\n \nc.  integrating temporary operators from other states to assist within plant \noperations; \nd.  granting provisional Class A licenses to two previously-licensed water \noperators at O.B. Curtis; \ne.  repairing or procuring critical treatment equipment; \nf.  increasing the facility maintenance capabilities at both plants in the short-term \nthrough use of mechanics, instrument technicians, electricians, and other \nworkers from other states; \ng.  engineering and developing a liquid soda-ash feed system for corrosion \ncontrol treatment at O.B. Curtis;  \nh.  sourcing parts for both plants; and \ni.  evaluating the winterization needs of the System. \n100. On or about September 6, 2022, water pressure within the System and water service to \nSystem users was restored. \n101. The July 29, 2022, BWN remained in effect until September 15, 2022.  \n102. Notwithstanding the actions that the State and the City have taken or will take to address \nthe emergency situation, an imminent and substantial endangerment to the health of persons \ncontinues to exist. \n103. From September 15, 2022, and through October 21, 2022, at least 16 more BWNs have \nbeen issued for various portions of the System. \n104. The City has consistently experienced a shortage of certified Class A operators, \nmaintenance personnel, and other key System personnel who can operate and maintain the \nSystem.   \n26 \n \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-00686-HTW-LGI   Document 1   Filed 11/29/22   Page 27 of 42\n(cid:3)\n \n105. While System operations are currently being supplemented by contractors working under \nemergency, short-term contracts, this is not a long-term solution to the City’s regulatory \nrequirement to have a certified Class A operator onsite whenever O.B. Curtis and J.H. Fewell are \nin operation.  See Miss. Admin. Code § 15-20-72.2.2.1(5). \n106. The emergency response does not address all of the repairs and rehabilitation needed for \nO.B. Curtis and J.H. Fewell to ensure long-term compliance with the SDWA, including but not \nlimited to full repair of the O.B. Curtis conventional and membrane filters. \n107. The emergency response does not address all of the repairs and rehabilitation needed for \nthe distribution system, which requires inter alia repairing or replacing failing lines, developing \na standard operating procedure for exercising valves and hydrants, conducting continuous \npressure monitoring in the distribution system to characterize pressure loss issues, and \ndeveloping and implementing a flushing program to improve water quality. \n108. The emergency response is not designed to address the City’s financial and technical \ncapacity shortfalls that have long hindered the City’s ability to operate the System in compliance \nwith the law and in a manner that ensures a reliable source of drinking water for System users.  \nAbsent appropriate relief, the City will continue to experience these shortfalls and the System’s \nusers remain at risk of losing water access and dealing with boil-water notices during severe \nweather events and during System failures. \n109. As the Mayor stated when appearing on “Amanpour & Co.” on September 6, 2022: \nUntil we have significant funding to deal with the challenges for the three decades’ long \nof neglect and lack of investment in our water treatment facility, it’s not a matter of if, \nbut it’s a matter of when these systems will fail again. \n \n110. As the Mayor further stated when appearing on “Face the Nation” on September 11, \n2022:  \n27 \n \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-00686-HTW-LGI   Document 1   Filed 11/29/22   Page 28 of 42\n(cid:3)\n \nThey [residents] have yet to have the boil water notice lifted, and so there are still \nconcerns around the consumption of that water. \n \nRight now, as many repairs and adjustments are taking place in the triage period of where \nwe are at the water treatment facility.  There’s also investigatory sampling taking place.  \nAnd so we believe that it’s a matter of days, not weeks, before that boil water notice can \nbe lifted. \n \nBut I would note this, that we have been here before, where we’ve been [able] to restore \npressure.  We’ve been able to lift boil water notices.  But without the significant capital \nimprovements to take place, it still is a matter of [when, not if] these things will happen \nagain. \n \n111. Therefore, while significant, the actions taken pursuant to the emergency response will \nnot provide long-term, sustainable solutions to the City’s drinking water system to a degree that \nwill reliably protect the health of persons served by the System. \nGENERAL ALLEGATIONS \n112. The City owns and operates the System. \n113. The City is a “person” within the meaning of the SDWA, Mississippi SDWA, National \nRegulations, and State Regulations because it is a municipality.  See 42 U.S.C. § 300f(12); 40 \nC.F.R. § 141.2; Miss. Code Ann. § 41-26-3(p); Miss. Admin. Code § 15-20-72-2.1.2.11. \n114. The System’s surface water system and groundwater system are each a “public water \nsystem” and a “community water system” within the meaning of the SDWA, Mississippi \nSDWA, National Regulations, and State Regulations because they each regularly serve at least \n25 year-round residents.  42 U.S.C. § 300f(15); 40 C.F.R. § 141.2; Miss. Code Ann. §§ 41-26-\n3(c) and (q); Miss. Admin. Code §§ 15-20-72-1.1.2.10 and 15-20-72.-2.1.2.4.   \n115. As public water systems that are community water systems, the System’s surface water \nsystem and groundwater system are each subject to the requirements of the National Regulations \nand the State Regulations.  40 C.F.R. § 141.1; 40 C.F.R. Part 141 passim (imposing requirements \n28 \n \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-00686-HTW-LGI   Document 1   Filed 11/29/22   Page 29 of 42\n(cid:3)\n \non community water systems); Miss. Code Ann. § 41-26-5(2)(a); Miss. Admin Code § 15-20-72-\n1.1.4. \n116. The City is a “supplier of water” within the meaning of the SDWA, Mississippi SDWA, \nNational Regulations, and State Regulations because it owns and operates a public water system.  \nSee 42 U.S.C. § 300f(5); 40 C.F.R. § 141.2; Miss. Code Ann. § 41-26-3(s) (“supplier of water” \nmeans any person who owns or controls a public water system).   \n117. As a supplier of water, the City must comply with the National Regulations and the State \nRegulations.  40 C.F.R. Part 141 passim (imposing requirements on suppliers of water); Miss. \nCode Ann. § 41-26-15(b); Miss. Admin. Code § 15-20-72 passim (same). \n118. The System’s surface water system is a Class A system because it is a system with \nsurface water treatment, groundwater under the direct influence of surface water, lime softening, \nor coagulation and filtration for the removal of constituents other than iron or manganese.  See \nMiss. Admin. Code § 15-20-72.2.2.1(5). \n119. Sediment or other matter causing significant cloudiness in water, or high turbidity, is a \n“contaminant” within the meaning of the SDWA because it is a physical substance or matter in \nwater.  See 42 U.S.C. § 300f(6). \n120. HAA5 is a “contaminant” within the meaning of the SDWA because it is a chemical \nsubstance or matter in water.  See 42 U.S.C. § 300f(6). \n121. Coliforms, E. Coli, Cryptosporidium, Giardia, Legionella, and viruses, pathogens, and \nbacteria are “contaminants” within the meaning of the SDWA because they are biological \nsubstances or matter in water.  See 42 U.S.C. § 300f(6). \n29 \n \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-00686-HTW-LGI   Document 1   Filed 11/29/22   Page 30 of 42\n(cid:3)\n \n122. EPA is authorized to bring this civil action because on February 28, 2020, MSDH \nrequested that EPA take the lead in the SDWA enforcement process with the City.  See \n42 U.S.C. § 300g-3(b)(2) (authorizing civil action if requested by state primacy agency). \nFIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nInjunctive Relief to Abate an Imminent and Substantial Endangerment to Health  \n(SDWA Section 1431, 42 U.S.C. § 300i) \n \n123. Paragraphs 1 through 122 are realleged and incorporated by reference. \n124. The EPA has received information that one or more contaminants, including at least \nsediment or other matter causing significant cloudiness in water, HAA5, coliforms, E. Coli, \nCryptosporidium, Giardia, Legionella, or other viruses, pathogens, or bacteria, is present in or is \nlikely to enter the System, which may present an imminent and substantial endangerment to the \nhealth of persons.  Such information includes: \na.  the over 320 BWNs issued over the last two years, the vast majority which are \ncaused by loss of pressure, as set forth in Attachment A; \nb.  the nearly seven-week surface water systemwide BWN running from July 29, \n2022, through September 15, 2022; \nc.  the excessive number of line breaks in the System, which may create back \nsiphonage capable of contaminating water in the System with contaminants \noutside the System; \nd.  the heightened susceptibility to breakage and corrosion of aging, pre-1910 \ncast iron distribution lines in the System; \ne.  the City’s failure to adequately staff O.B. Curtis and J.H. Fewell with certified \nClass A operators;  \n30 \n \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-00686-HTW-LGI   Document 1   Filed 11/29/22   Page 31 of 42\n(cid:3)\n \nf.  the City’s failure to maintain equipment to ensure appropriate operation and \nmaintenance of O.B. Curtis, J.H Fewell, and the distribution system; \ng.  the City’s failure to perform routine flushing of the distribution system; \nh.  the infrequent cycling of storage tanks and poor mixing performance ratios; \ni.  the frequent failures to maintain appropriate pH parameters as a corrosion \ncontrol method; \nj.  the failure of the System that began in August 2022 resulting in local, State, \nand federal emergency declarations and the loss of running water for many of \nthe System’s users for over a week; \nk.  the City’s recurring failures to implement an Alternative Water Source Plan \nfollowing specified triggering events; \nl.  the City’s failure to comply with the Emergency Order; and \nm. the City’s failure to comply with the Consent Order. \n125. EPA has consulted with the State and local authorities to confirm the correctness of the \ninformation that contaminants are present in or are likely to enter the System, and to ascertain the \nactions that such authorities are or will be taking. \n126. State and local actions have been insufficient to prevent the threat of additional failures in \nthe System.  See 42 U.S.C. § 300i(a) (allowing Section 1431 claims when, inter alia, state and \nlocal authorities have “not acted” in a manner that “protect[s] the health of persons”).  Such \nfailures are likely to continue to occur, whether under normal working conditions or in extreme \nweather events.   \n127. Under Section 1431(a) of the SDWA, 42 U.S.C. § 300i(a), the United States seeks an \ninjunction to abate the imminent and substantial endangerment, including such relief as the Court \n31 \n \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-00686-HTW-LGI   Document 1   Filed 11/29/22   Page 32 of 42\n(cid:3)\n \ndeems necessary to ensure the permanent and reliable provision of water, in compliance with the \nSDWA, to the System’s customers.    \nSECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nFailure to Staff O.B. Curtis and J.H. Fewell with Class A Operators at All Times \n(SDWA Section 1414, 42 U.S.C. § 300g-3; Miss. Admin. Code § 15-20-72.2.2.1(5)) \n \n128. Paragraphs 1 through 122 are realleged and incorporated by reference. \n129. At both O.B. Curtis and J.H. Fewell, the City lacks sufficient certified Class A operators, \nnecessitating unsustainable working conditions, supplemental coverage by non-operators who \nhold Class A licenses (e.g., a Deputy Director of Water Operations and an operations \nsupervisor), and high turnover of operators. \n130. Timesheets for just four months of operation this year show that, in at least 15 instances, \nJ.H. Fewell did not have a certified Class A operator onsite while in operation: \nDate  Time \nJune 5-6, 2022  8:18 p.m. – 6:52 a.m. \nJune 6-7, 2022  9:19 p.m. – 7:08 a.m. \nJune 11, 2022  7:00 a.m. – 10:00 a.m. \n2:00 p.m. – 6:56 p.m. \nJune 12-13, 2022  7:13 p.m. – 6:55 a.m. \nJune 17, 2022  4:30 p.m. – 7:04 p.m. \nJune 18, 2022  7:00 a.m. – 7:04 p.m. \nJune 19-20, 2022  7:11 p.m. – 6:53 a.m. \nJune 21, 2022  4:00 a.m. – 6:57 a.m. \nJune 24, 2022  4:59 p.m. – 7:05 p.m. \nJune 25, 2022  7:01 a.m. – 7:05 p.m. \nJune 26-27, 2022  7:00 p.m. – 6:52 a.m. \nJune 28, 2022  4:03 a.m. – 6:55 a.m. \nJuly 1, 2022  4:22 p.m. – 7:00 p.m. \nJuly 2, 2022  7:00 a.m. – 3:09 p.m. \n \n32 \n \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-00686-HTW-LGI   Document 1   Filed 11/29/22   Page 33 of 42\n(cid:3)\n \n131. As documented in the July 2022 Assessment, the City has insufficient operators to, \namong other things, consistently staff three shifts a day, seven days per week.   \n132. On May 18, 2022, the City’s then-Deputy Director of Water Operations emailed the \nthen-Director of Public Works (cc-ing the Chief Administrative Officer and Chief Financial \nOfficer), stating: “I worked 24 to 36 hours at OBC [O.B. Curtis] every Saturday and Sunday 7a-\n7p and Wednesday or Thursday night 7p-7a over six (6) months last year because of the Class A \noperator shortage.  At this point, I am just worn down.” \n133. On November 16, 2021, the City Engineer emailed the Director of Human Resources, \nChief Administrative Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and the then-Director of Public Works \nabout the “low number of current licensed water operators.”  He wrote: “If we lose any \nadditional operators at either plant a shutdown is unavoidable.  We are in an emergency crisis.  \nWe are overworking our staff due to our low numbers that [sic] putting a lot of stress and strain \non them.  The lack of competitive pay is hindering our efforts to recruit new water operators.” \n134. In an October 27, 2021, memorandum from the City Engineer to the then-Director of \nPublic Works, Chief Administrative Officer, Director of Human Resources, and a human \nresource officer titled “Recruitment and Retention Policy for Water Treatment Plants,” the City \nEngineer stated: \nThe Department of Health requires a Class A Operator on duty during all hours of \noperations.  We are facing a severe situation that needs to be addressed proactively.  \nCurrently, we have six class “A” licensed operators between the two plants that are in \noperations twenty-four (24) hours a day, 365 days a year.  Our current operators are \nworking more than one shift and covering empty shifts due [to] the shortage of Class A \noperators at each plant and working more than one job just to keep up with the cost of \nliving in Jackson that in turn puts the city’s water at risk by having tired semi alert \noperators watching the water process.  This poses a safety hazard not only to the water \nprocess but our operators as well. \n \n33 \n \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-00686-HTW-LGI   Document 1   Filed 11/29/22   Page 34 of 42\n(cid:3)\n \n135. Thus, the City has not sufficiently staffed its System with certified Class A operators \nonsite at all times of operation, in violation of Miss. Admin. Code § 15-20-72.2.2.1(5). \n136. Paragraph 39 of the Consent Order required the City to submit a Comprehensive Staffing \nPlan within 30 days of the Consent Order’s effective date, i.e., no later than July 31, 2021.  The \nPlan was required to inter alia identify how the City will ensure that a Class A operator is onsite \nat all times, including any backup plans in case staff are unavailable. \n137. The City has not provided EPA with a Comprehensive Staffing Plan, in violation of \nParagraph 39 of the Consent Order. \n138. Under Section 1414(b) of the SDWA, 42 U.S.C. § 300g-3(b), the United States is entitled \nto injunctive relief to remedy the violations and, as appropriate, civil penalties.  Unless enjoined \nby an order of the Court, violations of the State Regulations and the Consent Order are likely to \ncontinue and/or recur. \nTHIRD CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nFailures to Implement the Alternative Water Source Plan  \n(SDWA Section 1431, 42 U.S.C. § 300i) \n \n139. Paragraphs 1 through 122 are realleged and incorporated by reference. \n140. EPA issued the 2020 Emergency Order to the City under Section 1431(a)(1) of the \nSDWA, 42 U.S.C. § 300i(a)(1). \n141. As required by Paragraph 39.a of the Emergency Order, the City developed and \nsubmitted an Alternative Water Source Plan (“AWSP”) to EPA for review and approval.  EPA \napproved the City’s May 21, 2020, AWSP.  Among other things required by the AWSP, \nalternative water “must be made available at no cost to every person served by the System, as \nneeded for drinking, cooking, maintaining oral hygiene, and dishwashing,” and the City must \nprovide “at least one gallon per day, per person to every person served in the affected area.” \n34 \n \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-00686-HTW-LGI   Document 1   Filed 11/29/22   Page 35 of 42\n(cid:3)\n \n142. Under Paragraph 39.c.ii of the Emergency Order, the City must implement the AWSP for \nas long as any of the daily special purpose samples required under Paragraph 37 (CFE Turbidity \nExceedance Events) or Paragraph 38 (Low Pressure/Loss of Pressure Events) of the Emergency \nOrder receives a total coliform-positive sample result. \n143. During the below seven boil-water-notice events, the System had a daily special purpose \nsample that was total-coliform positive, yet the City did not implement its AWSP: \nBoil Water  Reason for Boil Water Notice  Dates of Boil Water \nNotice ID  Notice \n10-BWN-2020  Pressure loss due to valve replacement  August 6-11, 2020 \n37-BWN-2020  Pressure loss when contractor hit main  August 13-19, 2020 \nline \n41-BWN-2020  Pressure loss due to break on main line  August 23-25, 2020 \n84-BWN-2020   Pressure loss due to line break  December 23-30, 2020 \n19-BWN-2021  Pressure loss due to break on line  January 27-February 1, \n2021 \n48-BWN-2021  Pressure loss due to blow out on main line  June 12-17, 2021 \n67-BWN-2021  Pressure loss due to malfunctioning valve  August 20-26, 2021 \n \n144. Thus, the City has failed to implement the AWSP when required, in violation of \nParagraph 39 of the Emergency Order. \n145. Under Section 1431(a) and (b) of the SDWA, 42 U.S.C. § 300i(a) and (b), the United \nStates is entitled to injunctive relief to remedy the violations and, as appropriate, civil penalties.  \nUnless enjoined by an order of the Court, violations of the Emergency Order are likely to recur. \nFOURTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nExceedances of Turbidity Limits \n(SDWA Section 1414, 42 U.S.C. § 300g-3; 40 C.F.R. §§ 141.173(a)(2) and (a)(1);  \nMiss. Admin. Code § 15-20-72.1.7.4) \n \n146. Paragraphs 1 through 122 are realleged and incorporated by reference. \n147. Under Subpart P (Enhanced Filtration and Disinfection – Systems Serving 10,000 or \nMore People) of the National Regulations and the implementing State Regulations, the turbidity \n35 \n \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-00686-HTW-LGI   Document 1   Filed 11/29/22   Page 36 of 42\n(cid:3)\n \nlevel of representative samples of the System’s filtered water must at no time exceed 1 \nnephelometric unit (“NTU”).  40 C.F.R. § 141.173(a)(2) (setting forth turbidity requirements for \nsystems using conventional filtration); Miss. Admin. Code § 15-20-72.1.7.4 (requiring \ncompliance with 40 C.F.R. § 141.173).  \n148. The turbidity levels of filtered water samples from the System taken between February \n18-23, 2021, exceeded 1 NTU, in violation of 40 C.F.R. § 141.173(a)(2) and Miss. Admin. Code \n§ 15-20-72.1.7.4.   \n149. The turbidity levels of filtered water samples from the System taken on June 27 and 28, \n2022, exceeded 1 NTU—ranging as high as 7.5 NTU—in violation of 40 C.F.R. § 141.173(a)(2) \nand Miss. Admin. Code § 15-20-72.1.7.4.   \n150. The turbidity levels of filtered water samples from the System taken on July 18, 2022, \nexceeded 1 NTU—ranging as high as 2.5 NTU—in violation of 40 C.F.R. § 141.173(a)(2) and \nMiss. Admin. Code § 15-20-72.1.7.4.   \n151. Under Subpart P (Enhanced Filtration and Disinfection – Systems Serving 10,000 or \nMore People) of the National Regulations and the implementing State Regulations, the turbidity \nlevel of representative samples of the System’s filtered water must be less than or equal to 0.3 \nNTU in at least 95% of the measurements taken each month.  40 C.F.R. § 141.173(a)(1); Miss. \nAdmin. Code § 15-20-72-1.7.4. \n152. In February 2021, the System failed to meet that standard, in violation of 40 C.F.R. \n§ 141.173(a)(1) and Miss. Admin. Code § 15-20-72-1.7.4.  Specifically: \na.  At O.B. Curtis, only 75% of the turbidity measurements were less than or \nequal to 0.3 NTU; and \n36 \n \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-00686-HTW-LGI   Document 1   Filed 11/29/22   Page 37 of 42\n(cid:3)\n \nb.  At J.H. Fewell, only 93% of the turbidity measurements were less than or \nequal to 0.3 NTU. \n153. Under Section 1414(b) of the SDWA, 42 U.S.C. § 300g-3(b), the United States is entitled \nto injunctive relief to remedy the violations and, as appropriate, civil penalties.  Unless enjoined \nby an order of the Court, violations of the National Regulations and the State Regulations are \nlikely to recur. \nFIFTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nFailure to Timely Proceed with General Filter Rehabilitation at J.H. Fewell \n(SDWA Section 1414, 42 U.S.C. § 300g-3) \n \n154. Paragraphs 1 through 122 are realleged and incorporated by reference. \n155. To address turbidity exceedances at J.H. Fewell and as required by task no. 6 of the \nConsent Order’s CERP, the City developed an initial scope of work to rehabilitate the filters at \nJ.H. Fewell in order to return them to fully operational and functional status.  See Consent Order \nat Appendix A (CERP), task no. 6.  Upon EPA approval of the scope of work, the CERP would \nbe updated to include the individual tasks and timeframe.  Id.   \n156. EPA approved the City’s initial scope of work for the general filters on December 13, \n2021, and a revised scope of work on February 4, 2022.  Under task no. 6.B of the scope of \nwork, the City agreed to issue a notice to proceed to begin the engineering design process within \neight months of the City’s execution of Drinking Water State Revolving Fund (“DWSRF”) Loan \nNo. 3. \n157. The City and the State executed DWSRF Loan No. 3 on September 30, 2021, so the \nnotice to proceed to begin the engineering design process was due to be issued by May 30, 2022.   \n158. On April 4, 2022, the City requested an extension and proposed to start the design \nprocess on July 1, 2023.  EPA denied this extension. \n37 \n \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-00686-HTW-LGI   Document 1   Filed 11/29/22   Page 38 of 42\n(cid:3)\n \n159. Thus, the City has not timely issued the notice to proceed to begin the engineering design \nprocess and has not timely begun the design process to rehabilitate the general filters at J.H. \nFewell, in violation of Paragraph 40 and task no. 6 of the CERP (Appendix A) of the Consent \nOrder.  \n160. Under Section 1414(b) of the SDWA, 42 U.S.C. § 300g-3(b), the United States is entitled \nto injunctive relief to remedy the violation and, as appropriate, civil penalties.  Unless enjoined \nby an order of the Court, violations of the Consent Order are likely to continue. \nSIXTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nFailure to Install Corrosion Control Treatment \n(SDWA Section 1414, 42 U.S.C. § 300g-3; 40 C.F.R. §§ 141.80(e) and 141.83;  \nMiss. Admin. Code § 15-20-72.1.3.2) \n \n161. Paragraphs 1 through 122 are realleged and incorporated by reference. \n162. Under Subpart I (Control of Lead and Copper) of the National Regulations and the \nimplementing State Regulations, the System’s lead action level is exceeded if the concentration \nof lead in more than 10% of tap water samples collected during any monitoring period is greater \nthan 0.015 mg/L (i.e., if the 90th percentile lead level is greater than 0.015 mg/L).  40 C.F.R. \n§ 141.80(c); Miss. Admin Code § 15-20-72.1.3.2 (incorporating National Regulations on lead \nand copper). \n163. When the lead action level is exceeded, the System shall implement all applicable source \nwater treatment requirements specified by the State under 40 C.F.R. § 141.83.  40 C.F.R. \n§ 141.80(e).  Under 40 C.F.R. § 141.83, the System must complete source water monitoring and \nmake treatment recommendations to the State within 180 days after the end of the monitoring \nperiod during which the lead action level was exceeded.  40 C.F.R. § 141.83(a)(1).  The State \n38 \n \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-00686-HTW-LGI   Document 1   Filed 11/29/22   Page 39 of 42\n(cid:3)\n \nthen makes a determination regarding source water treatment and, if necessary, may require the \npublic water system to install and operate such treatment.  40 C.F.R. § 141.83(a)(2)-(3). \n164. The System exceeded the lead action level of 0.015 mg/L for the monitoring periods of \nJanuary-June 2015, January-June 2016, and July-December 2016. \n165. MSDH issued a compliance plan to the City on February 12, 2016, to address the lead \naction level exceedances. \n166. The City conducted an optimal corrosion control treatment (“OCCT”) study between \nOctober 2016 and April 2017 and provided the recommended treatment technique to MSDH on \nJune 13, 2017.  \n167. MSDH concurred with the recommended treatment technique and set a deadline of \nMay 31, 2019, for the City to complete installing the treatment at J.H. Fewell.  At the City’s \nrequest, MSDH later extended the deadline to December 29, 2019.  \n168. The City has not completed installing OCCT at J.H. Fewell, in violation of the National \nRegulations and the State Regulations.  See 40 C.F.R. §§ 141.80(e) and 141.83; Miss. Admin. \nCode § 15-20-72.1.3.2. \n169.

Under Subpart G (Maximum Contaminant Levels and Maximum Residual Disinfectant \nLevels) of the National Regulations and the implementing State Regulations, the maximum \ncontaminant level for HAA5 is 0.060 mg/L, or 60 μg/L, determined as a locational running \nannual average at each monitoring location.  40 C.F.R. § 141.64(b); Miss. Admin. Code § 15-20-\n72.1.2.6 (applying 40 C.F.R. § 141.64 to public water systems).  The “locational running annual \naverage” is the average of sample analytical results for samples taken at a particular monitoring \nlocation during the previous four calendar quarters.  40 C.F.R. § 141.2.  The maximum \ncontaminant level for HAA5 is a health-based standard, as HAA5 may cause an increased risk of \ncancer when ingested long term. \n172. The HAA5 locational running annual average at one monitoring site in the System’s \ndistribution system for the 4th Quarter of 2020 was 0.066 mg/L, or 66 μg/L. \n173. The HAA5 locational running annual average at one monitoring site in the System’s \ndistribution system for the 1st Quarter of 2021 was 0.065 mg/L, or 65 μg/L. \n174.
