    "summary": "<p>On June 7, 2021, a Black woman police officer filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against the District and the Metropolitan Police Department. She alleged that the Department discriminated against her on the basis of race, gender, age, and disability status. Plaintiff was represented by private counsel. In her complaint, she alleged that, starting in 2017, she experienced a pervasive culture of hyper-scrutiny, obscenity, hyper-sexuality, and unreasonable assignments and that the Department disproportionately disciplined, denied benefits, and made denigrating comments (including on the basis of disability) towards her and other Black women. The plaintiff complained both formally and informally but did not receive help; she alleged that this reporting was leaked and used as a basis for retaliation. Ultimately, the Department terminated her in 2021.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiff raised twelve claims: six claims of disparate treatment, hostile work environment, and retaliation on the basis of race and sex under the Civil Rights Act of 1964; three race discrimination claims under the Civil Rights Act of 1866 (regarding contracts); a claim under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act; a claim under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 about disparate treatment on the basis of disability; and a claim for violation of the Whistleblower Protection Act due to retaliation. She sought monetary damages of not less than $250,000, for lost wages, lost reputation, lost career opportunities, mental pain and suffering, and reimbursement, as well as punitive damages. She also sought interest, costs, and fees, and to have her record cleaned and to be reinstated as a Senior Police Officer. Lastly, she asked the court to order the Metropolitan Police Department to train its supervisory officials on discrimination and to institute a policy and procedure against discrimination, retaliation, and hostile work environments.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On September 5, 2021, D.C. moved to dismiss the original complaint. On September 22, 2022, the plaintiff filed an amended complaint adding nine other experienced Black women police officers as plaintiffs. The new plaintiffs also complained of discrimination, firing, demotion, involuntary transfer, and attempts to bully them into quitting. They each joined various of the original twelve claims and demanded at least $250,000 in compensatory damages per plaintiff. The individual plaintiffs sought to represent the class of similarly situated Black woman police officers employed by the Department beginning in January 1, 2011 (up to 700 class members).</p>\r\n<p>On December 6, 2021, D.C. moved to partially dismiss the amended complaint. On June 13, 2022, plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint adding a claim that one of the individual plaintiffs was unfairly denied leave, in violation of the Family Medical Leave Act. On July 22, 2022, D.C. moved to partially dismiss the second amended complaint, arguing that the plaintiffs had failed to exhaust their other remedies, that the claims were untimely and time-barred, and that some allegations failed to state a claim. D.C. also sought partial summary judgment, arguing that the claims would all eventually fail on the merits. This motion remains pending as of May 2023.&nbsp;</p>",

Brinkley (hereinafter “Plaintiff Brinkley”); Tiara \nBrown (hereinafter “Plaintiff Brown”); Karen Carr (hereinafter “Plaintiff Carr”); Leslie Clark \n(hereinafter “Plaintiff Clark”); Chanel Dickerson (hereinafter “Plaintiff Dickerson”); Regenna \nGrier  (hereinafter  “Plaintiff  Grier”);  Tamika  Hampton  (hereinafter  “Plaintiff  Hampton”); \nTabatha Knight (hereinafter “Plaintiff Knight”); LaShaun Lockerman (hereinafter “Plaintiff \nLockerman”), and Kia Mitchell (hereinafter “Plaintiff Mitchell”), collectively hereinafter “the \nClass Representative Plaintiffs” or “CRPs”, by and through undersigned counsel, with their FIRST \nAMENDED AND CONSOLIDATED COMPLAINT against Defendant the District of Columbia \n(hereinafter “DC” or “Defendant”) Metropolitan Police Department (hereinafter “MPD”). \nPlaintiffs are a group of African American (hereinafter “Black”) female police officers. All \nPlaintiffs, except Plaintiff Brown, have served the District of Columbia government as law \nenforcement officers for more than fifteen (15) years. Plaintiff Brown served the District of \nColumbia for five (5) years and was honored as MPD Officer of the Year during her tenure. Their \ncontributions to the police force and experience on the job have been assets to the MPD for more \nthan 100 years combined. Sadly, each Class Representative Plaintiff has had to endure the \nvictimization of an MPD enterprise-wide culture of race and sex discrimination and intense  \npervasive retaliation against those who dared to complain about, report or oppose unlawful \ndiscrimination. \n  In this case, every Class Representative Plaintiff has complained multiple times about \nunfair treatment on the basis of their race and gender to either the Department’s EEO officials \nand/or their managers, to no avail.  They come together as a class here to describe how the MPD \nhas, for decades, treated Black women police officers with contempt, to the point of systematic \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 4 of 208\n \npsychological abuse.  As is often the case, the abuse is often not visible by looking at one person, \nor one incident. There are four fundamental characteristics of the MPD that this class action lawsuit \nseeks to change: 1) MPD has a male-dominated culture that accepts and perpetuates the most \ndemeaning, degrading and disrespectful discourse and actions by and between officers; 2) MPD \nhas a culture that nurtures and encourages supervisory and management officers to abuse their \npower to exact petty vengeance on subordinates and make their lives miserable; 3) MPD has a \nprofoundly dysfunctional and corrupt EEO Office run by a man who has repeatedly expressed \nhostility to women officers, and who colludes with management to crush Black women who \ncomplain about race and gender discrimination and sexual harassment; and 4) MPD, with the full \nparticipation and/or approval of the Chiefs of Police, engages in repeated, coordinated and \nrelentless retaliation campaigns against Black women officers who complain about or oppose \ndiscrimination, or other police misconduct.  In combination, these four MPD characteristics create \na profoundly toxic work environment for Black woman officers.   \n This lawsuit seeks to ensure that MPD’s discriminatory practices are eradicated for current \nand future Black women police officers, and to obtain full redress for Class Representative \nPlaintiffs and the class members who have been harmed by MPD’s consistent system-wide pattern, \npractice, and custom of race and gender discrimination and retaliation.  \nPARTIES \n                                                                   THE CLASS \n1.  Plaintiffs seek to represent a class, broken into sub-classes as deemed appropriate by this \nCourt after appropriate pre-class certification discovery, of all Black women police officers \nemployed by the MPD between January 1, 2011, and the present.   \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 5 of 208\n \n2.  On information and belief, the class will potentially consist of more than seven hundred \n(700) current and former Black women police officers, broken down into management officers, \nbargaining unit officers, Senior Police Officers, and academy cadets.   \n3.  All class members were subject to the direct authority of the respective present and past \nChiefs of Police, governed by universally applicable MPD policies and practices.  \n      THE CLASS REPRESENTATIVE PLAINTIFFS \n4.

This Honorable Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331 as it \nasserts claims that arise under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States, specifically \nTitle VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e, et seq., (‘Title VII”), \nDistrict of Columbia Human Rights Act, District of Columbia Code § 2-1401.01 et seq., The Civil \nRights Act of 1866, 42 U.S.C. § 1981(a), 42 U.S.C. 1981 by way and through 42 U.S.C. § 1983, \nthe  Age  Discrimination  in  Employment  Act,  29  U.S.C.  §§  621-634,  the  Americans  with \nDisabilities Act of 1967, 42 U.S.C. 126, § 12101 et seq., the District of Columbia Whistleblower \nProtection Act, District of Columbia Code § 1-615-51, et seq., and pendant tort claims against the \nDistrict of Columbia for negligent supervision.   \n22.  Venue is proper in the District of Columbia under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 and 29 U.S.C. § 1402 \nbecause substantially all the acts and omissions that give rise to this complaint occurred in the \nDistrict of Columbia.  Venue properly lies within this Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391 and 42 \nU.S.C. § 2000e-5(f)(3).  This Court is also the proper venue to adjudicate Plaintiffs’ pendant state \nlaw claims. \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 8 of 208\n \nFACTS RELEVANT TO ALL CLASS MEMBERS \nTHE MPD STRUCTURE AND CULTURE  \nMPD’S CENTRALIZED TOP-DOWN POWER HIERARCHY  \n23.  Much like the military, the MPD has a strict hierarchical decision-making structure and \nrigid chain of command.  While each level of leader in the hierarchy is granted some authority \nover day-to-day activities or routine police matters, the ultimate decision-maker on all police \nmatters is the Chief of Police. \n24.  The Chief of Police maintains a degree of supervision over the Department’s various \nmanagers and its Equal Employment Office, and  accessibility to all MPD employees who are able \nto speak directly to him or her upon request and appointment. \n25.  There are seven (7) classes of employees at MPD: \na.  Probationary cadets: persons hired via the police academy who are in their training \nphase, and are subject to discharge with little recourse other than through the EEOC charge \nprocess. \nb.  Probationary civilians: persons hired for civilian positions, and who have been \nemployed for less than one year.  They can be terminated without cause within the \nprobationary period with little recourse other than through the EEOC charge process.  \nc.  Sworn Bargaining Unit officers: officers who are full members of the Fraternal \nOrder of Police, Lodge #1, and benefit from all terms and conditions of employment \ncontained in the Collective Bargaining Agreement (hereinafter “CBA”), including just \ncause termination and the right to grieve any disciplinary action. \nd.  Civilian  employees:  persons  who  are  governed  by  the  District  of  Columbia \nemployee manual terms. \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 9 of 208\n \ne.  Senior Police Officers (hereinafter “SPO’s”):  retired officers who have been asked \nto come back to the MPD as full-time officers, but not as bargaining unit members.  SPO’s \ncan receive the assistance of a union representative, but are not subject to just cause \ntermination protections in the CBA. \nf.  Management-Level Sworn Officers:  officers with the rank of Lieutenant or Captain \nor Inspector.   \ng.  Executives: senior civil service civilians, and sworn officers with the rank of \nCommander, Assistant Chief (broken into three levels), or Chief. \n26.  The MPD is divided into administrative departments, specialized units, and geographically \ndelineated patrol districts. For example, the MPD has an administrative unit responsible for \ninvestigating all officer-involved traffic accidents, regardless of district or unit.   \n27.  It also has operational units, some of which are patrol and community based, others of \nwhich are specialized units such as SWAT Team or Harbor Patrol.  The operational functions are \nbroken down into Departments.  The Departments are made up of Bureaus, and the Bureaus are \nbroken down into separate Divisions.  \n28.  Each  Department  is  overseen  by  a  Bureau  Chief.    With  respect  to  policing  of  the \ncommunity through patrol district, each district has one Commander, a few Captains (the number \nof which varies by district), Lieutenants and Sergeants. \n29.  MPD Sergeants have the authority to set employee schedules, make daily assignments, \ndetermine  partnership  arrangements,  monitor  and  supervise  officer  conduct,  track  officer \nmovements and account for their activities, grant or deny requests for up to eight (8) hours of leave, \napprove  or  assign  overtime  work,  verify  time  sheets,  provide  content  and  input  to  officer \nperformance evaluations, and assign officers vehicles and equipment. \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 10 of 208\n \n30.  MPD Lieutenants have supervisory authority over Sergeants and serve as the first level of \ndispute management when officers have concerns or problems with the decisions of their district \nSergeants.  Lieutenants ensure that departmental operational goals are met, are responsible for \nofficer evaluations and minor discipline, and have significant input into what officers will be \nassigned to their department.  Lieutenants have the absolute authority to override the decisions of \ntheir subordinate Sergeants. \n31.  While minor disciplinary matters can be handled by Sergeants or Lieutenants, the authority \nto enact major discipline such as suspensions or terminations rests with the Chief of Police and is \ndelegated to the Internal Affairs Bureau, but can be overridden by the Chief of Police at any time. \n32.  Regardless of the authority delegated to subordinates, the Chief of Police retains total \ndiscretion to override the decisions of his or her subordinates. He or she also enjoy the authority \nto order any of his or her subordinates to carry out his or her wishes with respect to any employee \nof the MPD. \n33.  The MPD maintains one centralized EEO office for all personnel, whether civilian, SPO, \nsworn officer or management. This is the office that handles all internal complaints regarding \nunfair or discriminatory treatment. In theory, it is supposed to investigate, mediate, and address \nequal opportunity concerns.  \n34.  All bargaining unit members are subject to the same pay, promotion, assignment, and \ndisciplinary procedures as negotiated by the Union and outlined in the Collective Bargaining \nAgreement.  \n \n \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 11 of 208\n \n  MPD’S  CULTURE  OF  ALLOWING  AND  ENCOURAGING  FRONT-LINE \nSUPERVISORY ABUSE OF POWER  \n \n35.  The majority of day-to-day operational decisions are made by district Sergeants and \nLieutenants. This gives them the ability to make decisions that make an officer’s work pleasant, \nor very unpleasant. \n36.  Sergeants and Lieutenants also have the authority and responsibility to rate officers’ \nperformance, which has a direct impact on their promotability and job security. They set the tone \nfor their officers during regular meetings, such as roll call (a regularly scheduled meeting of all \nofficers on a shift to discuss daily assignments). \n37.  For the duration of the relevant period, the MPD has been aware that its Sergeants and \nLieutenants have used their power to abuse, harass, isolate, intimidate, bully and denigrate Black \nwomen police officers.  See., e.g., factual narratives of Plaintiffs Brown, Knight, Hampton, Grier. \n38.  In many instances when MPD leadership has been informed that a Sergeant or Lieutenant  \ntargeted a Black women officer for abuse which resulted in discrimination, MPD management \nchose to ignore or encourage that abuse.  See., e.g., factual narratives of Plaintiffs Carr, Clark, \nKnight, Hampton.  \n39.  MPD management maintains a pattern and practice of refusing to transfer Black female \nofficers who’ve asked to be transferred away from an abusive supervisor.  See., e.g., factual \nnarratives herein of Plaintiff Lockerman and Hampton. \n40.  MPD’s highest management maintains a pattern, practice and/or custom of refusing to \ncounsel or discipline supervisors who make or condoned sexist, racist, harassing or inappropriately \nsexualized comments.  See., e.g., factual narratives of Plaintiffs Brinkley, Mitchell, and Grier. \n41.  MPD’s highest management maintains a pattern and practice and/or custom of allowing \nand encouraging supervisors to retaliate against Black women officers who’ve complained about \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 12 of 208\n \nthe treatment they received by giving them undesirable assignments, assigning them inferior \nequipment, refusing overtime, refusing to give them desirable work schedules, denying them \ntraining opportunities, imposing disparate disciplinary standards, and falsely and inappropriately \nlowering  their  performance  evaluations.    See.,  e.g.,  factual  narratives  below  of  Plaintiffs \nDickerson, Clark, Mitchell, Knight. \n42.  MPD’s highest management maintains a pattern and practice and/or custom of allowing \nsupervisors to use the minor infraction disciplinary process to hyper-scrutinize, harass and attack \nBlack women officers in an effort to demoralize them and make them suffer for having opposed \nor complained about race or gender discrimination. See., e.g., factual narratives below of Plaintiffs \nHampton, Brinkley, Carr, Clark, and Grier. \n43.  MPD’s highest management maintains a pattern and practice and/or custom of refusing to \ninvestigate or act upon complaints of Black women officers who seek redress for discrimination, \nunfair and disparate treatment, and retaliation by their supervisors.  See., e.g., factual narratives \nbelow of Plaintiffs Dickerson, Knight, Carr, Brinkley, and Lockerman. \n44.  All CRPs have suffered from, and have complained to management about the MPD’s \nculture and practice of allowing supervisors to abuse, attack, bully, harass, discriminate and \nretaliate against them.  \n45.  The requested class relief herein includes: appropriate compensation to class victims and \ncorresponding declaratory and injunctive relief that remedies the MPD’s culture, pattern practice \nand/or  custom  of  allowing  supervisory  employees  to  abuse  their  power  with  impunity  for \nvindictive, petty, racist, sexist, and retaliatory reasons. \n \n \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 13 of 208\n \nTHE MPD’S SYSTEMATIC EEO PROBLEMS \nMPD’S DYSFUNCTIONAL AND CHILLING EEO OFFICE \n46.  Upon  information  and  belief,  Alphonso  Lee(hereinafter  “Mr.  Lee”),Director  of  the \nMPEEO Office,  has held his position since 2017. \n47.  Between December of 2020 and June of 2021, the EEO Office was managed by Mr. Lee, \nand three (3) subordinate EEO Counselors: Doreen Haines (hereinafter “Ms. Haines”); Rosemarie \nLucero (hereinafter “Ms. Lucero”); and Renae Lee (hereinafter “Ms. Lee”).  All three of these \nEEO Counselors have made internal complaints against Mr. Lee.1  \n48.  Between February and December of 2020, Harry Carter (hereinafter “Mr. Carter”) was an \nEEO Counselor.   \n49.  The sworn affidavits of Ms. Rosemarie Lucero, Harry Carter and Renae Lee are attached \nhere to as EXHIBITS 1, 2 and 3, respectively.  They explain in detail how the MPD EEO Office \noperated during their respective tenures, and reveal through sworn affirmations the extent degree \nof its corruption and dysfunction.  \n50.  During  his  tenure  as  MPD’s  EEO  Director,  Mr.  Lee  has  maintained  a  system  that \nintentionally  discredits  Black  women  complainants,  effectuates  a  pattern  and  practice  of \nretaliation, and bullies his subordinates into disavowing any and all claims of discrimination filed \nby Black women officers, thereby resulting in the Defendant’s sanctioning of discriminatory \npractices against Plaintiffs.  \n \n1 In June of 2021, David Simmons (white male) joined the office as an EEO Counselor. \n \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 14 of 208\n \n51.  As attested by Ms. Lucero in her affidavit, included as EXHIBIT 1, Mr. Lee holds and \nexpresses denigrating views about female police officers in general, and Black female police \nofficers. \n52.  Mr. Lee has repeatedly expressed to his staff his belief that female complainants are “liars” \nand “lazy,” and that they make EEO complaints to be manipulative.  See EXHIBIT 1 & 2. \n53.  Mr. Lee has made his views, which demonstrate sexist and racist behaviors, known to his \nsubordinates so frequently that they refer to it as his “mantra.”  See EXHIBITS 1 & 2. \n54.  Upon information and belief, in the course of four years, Mr. Lee has not permitted a single \nclaim of race or gender discrimination filed in his office to be substantiated.  Emphasis added. See \nEXHIBITS 1, 2 &3. \n55.  As can be seen in Mr. Carter, Ms. Lee’s and Ms. Lucero’s affidavits, Mr. Lee believes, and \nhas repeatedly stated that MPD is not subject to federal equal employment and non-discrimination \nlaws.  See EXHIBITS 1, 2 & 3. \n56.  Mr. Lee demands that his subordinates report to him what EEO complainants have said in \ninitial interviews, and then goes to management himself, to coordinate what the management \nresponse will be prior to the commencement of any investigation. See EXHIBITS 1, 2 & 3. \n57.  Mr. Lee required that EEO Counselors record all initial interviews, and then provided and \nor played these recordings for Assistant Chief Manlapaz (hereinafter “Asst. Chief Manlapaz”), the \nBureau Head of IAD, and/or other management personnel.  See EXHIBITS 1 & 2. \n58.  According  to  Mr.  Carter  and  Ms.  Lucero,  this  practice  of  playing  recordings  for \nmanagement contributed directly to immediate retaliation against complainants, and the pervasive \nperception that EEO interviews and complaints were not confidential.  See EXHIBITS 1 & 2, and \nsee., e.g., factual narratives of Plaintiffs Brinkley, Hampton. \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 15 of 208\n \n59.  Mr. Lee’s habit of violating confidentiality is a pattern, practice and/or custom designed to \ndiscourage Black woman police officers from using the EEO office and has succeeded in doing \nso.   \n60.  Mr. Lee demands that his subordinates investigate, not with an impartial eye to ascertain \nthe truth, but with an agenda to find facts that will undermine complainants’ claims as well as their \ncredibility.  See EXHIBITS 1, 2 & 3.  In doing so, he directs his subordinates to place statements \nin investigative reports to paint complainants in a negative light. See EXHIBITS 1 & 2.  \n61.  Mr. Lee edited and manipulated written reports, exit letters and other documents that are \nsupposed to reflect the issues raised by a complainant, to ensure that the DC Office of Human \nRights (hereinafter “OHR”), or the EEOC was misled about what it should be investigating.  See \nEXHIBITS 1 & 2, and see., e.g., below factual narrative of Plaintiff Knight. \n62.  Mr. Lee’s actions were maliciously designed to derail the ability of complainants to obtain \nredress from external entities.  \n63.  Mr.  Lee  worked  with  MPD  management  to  coordinate  management  responses  to \nundermine complainants, and to assist in bullying them and/or forcing them out.  See EXHIBITS \n1, 2 & 3. \n64.  If  Mr.  Lee’s  subordinates  refused  or  push-backed  on  his  demands  to  discredit  a \ncomplainant, he would retaliate against them by threatening their employment or by putting them \non a Performance Improvement Plan (hereinafter “PIP”).  He placed his EEO Counselors Ms. \nLucero and Ms. Haines on PIPs multiple times for frivolous or fictitious reasons in order to coerce \nthem to comply with his unlawful mandates.  See EXHIBITS 1 & 2. \n65.  On information and belief, Mr. Lee maintains an EEO Office so hostile and toxic that every \nwoman who has worked for him has filed a complaint against him, either internally or externally.  \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 16 of 208\n \n66.  On one occasion, a subordinate filed an EEO claim against Mr. Lee for screaming at, and \nbullying her.  Mr. Lee, as EEO Director, chose to investigate her complaint against him by self-\ninvestigation, and, not surprisingly, exonerated himself.  See EXHIBITS 1 & 2.  \n67.  This inappropriate exoneration violated MPD EEO policies that require (at least in theory) \nthat complaint investigations be conducted impartially. \n68.  Mr. Lee also maintains an unlawful pattern and practice of threatening to investigate \npersons who file EEO claims.  See EXHIBIT 1.  Among other things, he repeatedly requested Asst. \nChief Manlapaz of IAD to open investigations into complainants as punishment for complaining. \nSee EXHIBITS 1 & 2.  \n69.  The Mayor’s Office, District of Columbia City Council, OHR, IAD, Office of the Inspector \nGeneral (hereinafter “DC IG”), and the DC Attorney General’s Office have received multiple \ncomplaints and allegations against Mr. Lee and the MPD EEO Office but have either refused to \nacknowledge them, or to heretofore engage in any meaningful action to remedy the entrenched \naforementioned polices, practices and/or customs.  \n70.  Because of the dysfunctional and retaliatory nature of the MPD EEO Office, Black women \nofficers are left with little recourse but to seek assistance from external entities, DC OHR, the \nEEOC, and the DC IG office.  But, as soon as they did so, Mr. Lee ensured that they would become \nvictims of systemic and coordinated retaliatory efforts to bully, harass and force them out of their \nemployment.    \n71.  MPD executive management has received numerous complains about Mr. Lee and has \nrefused to take any action to mitigate his obvious, and systemic pattern of EEO abuses. \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 17 of 208\n \n72.  The CRPs have been harmed and affected by Mr. Lee and the MPD EEO Office’s default \ndismissal of their complaints of race and gender discrimination and retaliation complaints in the \nsame or similar way. \n73.  All putative class members (hereinafter “PCMs”) have been negatively affected by the \nunlawful and discriminatory practices of the MPD EEO Office in the same or similar way. \n74.  All PCMs would benefit from a class-wide remedy based on declaratory and injunctive \nrelief to repair the MPD EEO Office and bring it into alignment with federal law, DC human rights \nlaw, EEOC guidance, and industry best practices. \n  THE MPD EEO DIRECTOR USES THREATS AND INTIMIDATION TO CHILL \nTHE REPORTING OF DISCRIMINATION AND ABUSE \n \n75.  In furtherance of the MPD EEO Director’s efforts to breach  complainant confidentiality, \nMr. Lee requires his subordinates to sign an over-broad and unlawful non-disclosure agreement \nthat prohibits them from reporting or speaking out against anything that transpires in the EEO \nOffice.  A copy of the MPD EEO NDA is attached hereto as EXHIBIT 4. \n76.  The terms of the NDA extend far beyond confidentiality with respect to specific cases; it \nalso prohibits EEO Counselors from discussing any actions and activities of the EEO Office, \nincluding discriminatory and unlawful actions.  \n77.  Mr. Lee frequently reminds his counselors of its terms, and threatens to terminate them if \nthey report or complain about his actions. See EXHIBITS 1 & 2.  \n78.  Mr. Lee also requires complainants to sign the same over-broad NDA, and threatened them \nwith serious disciplinary action if they speak out about any component of the EEO process.  \n79.  This explains why the EEO Counselors have filed EEOC complaints with respect to the \nway Mr. Lee has treated them, but did not feel at liberty to report what Mr. Lee was doing to Black \nwomen MPD police officers who complained of discrimination.  See EXHIBITS 1 & 3. \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 18 of 208\n \n80.  Plaintiffs assert that Mr. Lee’s NDA is per se unlawful and was used to bully and intimidate \nEEO Counselors into complying with his intentional discrimination against Black women police \nofficers. \n81.  There is no reason why EEO Counselors should be prohibited from speaking to third parties \nsuch  as  lawyers,  City  Council  members,  the  Mayor’s  Office  or  others  about  MPD  EEO \ndiscriminatory “methods and practices.” \n82.  On multiple occasions, the CRPs attempted to speak directly with their supervisors, \nmanagers, and/or senior department leadership about attacks on their credibility and the skewed \nand dishonest conclusions in EEO reports.  See., e.g., factual narratives of Plaintiffs Brinkley, Carr, \nKnight and Grier. \n83.  MPD management, up to and including MPD Chiefs of Police, maintain a pattern and \npractice of ignoring, rebuffing, rebuking, and disbelieving the complaints from Black women \nofficers about the malfeasance of Mr. Lee, which effectively sanctioned his behaviors and nullified \nEEO protections for victims of discrimination.  \n84.  All  PCMs  are  being  harmed  by  Defendant’s  pattern  and  practice  and/or  custom  of \ndiscrimination via Mr. Lee’s threats and coercion of EEO staff. \n85.  All PCMs are harmed by Mr. Lee’s unlawful use of NDAs to chill proper enforcement of \nthe Department’s anti-discrimination laws.  \n86.  All PCMs would obtain a remedy if the Court were to order declaratory and injunctive \nrelief mandating that the MPD EEO Office cease and desist from using over-broad and misleading \nNDAs,  and  threatening  EEO  Counselors  with  termination  should  they  reveal  or  report  \nmalfeasance in the MPD EEO Office. \n87.   \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 19 of 208\n \nFACTS APPLICABLE TO THE PUTATIVE CLASS RELATED \nTO SYSTEMIC RETALIATION \n \n  THE MPD MAINTAIS A PATTERN AND PRACTICE OF RETALIATORY IAD \nINVESTIGATIONS  OF  BLACK  WOMEN  POLICE  OFFICERS  WHO \nCOMPLAIN  ABOUT  RACE  OR  GENDER  DISCRIMINATION  OR \nRETALIATION  \n \n88.  For the duration of the relevant period, MPD IAD has used its investigatory power to bully, \nharass and retaliate against Black women officers.  \n89.  On information and belief, and in accordance with Mr. Lee’s repeated admissions, Asst. \nChief Manlapaz has a close personal relationship with Mr. Lee.  See EXHIBITS 1, 2 & 3. \n90.  Whenever  a  complaint  was  made  against  Asst.  Chief  Manlapaz,  Mr.  Lee  chose  to \n“investigate” it personally, and then dismissed the allegation.  See EXHIBIT 1 & 2. \n91.  The converse is also true.  Asst. Chief Manlapaz would “investigate” any and all claims \nagainst Mr. Lee, and dismiss them.  See EXHIBIT 1 & 2.  \n92.  Mr. Lee has repeatedly informed his subordinates of the mutually beneficial arrangement \nhe has with Asst. Chief Manlapaz, going so far as to insist that no allegation against him will ever \nbe substantiated.  See EXHIBIT 1 & 2.  \n93.  Mr. Lee has repeatedly informed his subordinates that he has the power to ask Asst. Chief \nManlapaz to open an investigation into a complainant for no other reason than to taint the \ncomplainant’s credibility.  See EXHIBITS 1 & 2. \n94.  Asst. Chief Manlapaz has maintained a pattern and practice of opening investigations into \nBlack women officers who complain about discrimination, mistreatment or misconduct for the \nexpress purpose of retaliating against them and chilling others from complaining.   \n95.  Asst. Chief Manlapaz has intentionally sabotaged investigations into allegations made by \nBlack women officers to undermine their authority and ability to manage their staff, attack their \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 20 of 208\n \ncredibility, and stymie their ability to obtain redress of serious complains.  See., e.g., factual \nnarrative of Plaintiff Dickerson. \n96.  Because Asst. Chief Manlapaz has principle investigative authority through his role as the \nBureau Chief of IAD, he has the ability to affect officers at every level, in every department of \nMPD. \n97.  Thus, all PCMs were affected by Asst. Chief Manlapaz’ abuse of power, and his pattern \nand practice of retaliating against Black women officers for complaining about discrimination, \nmisconduct, harassment or retaliation.  \n98.  The Chief of Police, the Mayor’s Office, the AG’s Office, the DC City Council, the DC \nIG, and DC OHR have all received complaints about MPD IAD, and Asst. Chief Manlapaz, \ndetailing how he has abused his power as Bureau Chief of IAD, and that he opens frivolous and \nfraudulent investigations into Black women police officers to intimidate and retaliate against them.  \nAll of those complaints were ignored by DC government entities. \n99.  The entire putative class is negatively affected by Defendant’s maintenance of a pattern \nand practice and/or custom of retaliatory investigating via Asst. Chief Manlapaz’s actions.   \n100.  The entire putative class is negatively affected by Defendant’s pattern and practice of \nundermining or refusing to investigate allegations made by Black women police officers via Chief \nManlapaz’s actions. \n101.  All PCMs would obtain redress from a declaratory or injunctive remedy that revamps IAD \nto repair its policies and practices and retrains its agents to cease using their investigative powers \nto retaliate against complainants. \n102.   \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 21 of 208\n \n  MPD’S  MAINTAINS  A  PATTERN,  PRACTICE  AND/OR  CUSTOM  OF \nRETALIATING AGAINST BLACK WOMEN COMPLAINANTS BY WAY OF \nINVOLUNTARILY TRANSFERS \n \n103.  Another way in which the Chiefs of Police have used his power to retaliate against Black \nwomen who opposed or reported misconduct was to destabilize their work schedules and remove \nthem from their assignments or departments. \n104.  As mentioned above, MPD has several specialized units that are competitive to be assigned \nto, and are considered “elite” units.   \n105.  Many of these units are within the Special Operations Department (hereinafter “SOD”).  \nThey  include:    K-9  Unit;  Explosive  Ordinance  Division  (hereinafter  “EOD”);  Emergency \nResponse Team (hereinafter “ERT”); SWAT; Search and Rescue Team; Harbor Patrol; Special \nEvents Detail; Presidential and Vice-Presidential Detail; Mounted Police; Motorcycle Police; \nHelicopter Patrol; and Traffic Division. \n106.  MPD Chiefs of Police have removed Black Female officers from their long-standing \nfavorable assignments on nothing more than an accusation of an infraction.  See., e.g., factual \nnarratives of Plaintiffs Knight & Clark. \n107.  MPD Chiefs of Police, or their designates, have threatened Black women officers with \ntransfer if they complain about a co-worker or supervisor discriminating against, harassing or \nbullying them.  See., e.g., factual narrative of Plaintiff Dickerson. \n108.  MPD has weaponized the IAD investigative process, using it to threaten and bully officers \ninto compliance with an outcome desired by the Chief of Police, or his or her designates.  See., \ne.g., factual narratives of Plaintiffs Brown, Brinkley, Carr, Knight, Dickerson, Hampton. \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 22 of 208\n \n109.  The MPD maintains a pattern, practice and/or custom of forcing Black women officers to \nrelinquish desirable assignments in exchange for not being fraudulently and unfairly “investigated” \nby IAD, or otherwise disciplined.  \n110.  Black women have been disproportionately targeted for transfer out of desirable or elite \nunits.  \n111.  When a Black woman is actually cleared of an allegation of misconduct, MPD does not \nimmediately reinstate her to the desirable unit or assignment.  See., e.g., factual narratives of \nPlaintiff Knight & Hampton. \n112.  MPD’s  pattern  and  practice  of  retaliatory  transfer  of  complainants  creates  a  chilled \nenvironment for Black women officers, and discourages them from complaining about race and \ngender discrimination and retaliation.  \n113.  The CRPs have been negatively affected by MPD’s pattern and practice of retaliatory and \nabusive departmental transfer. \n114.  Because the Chiefs of Police have sole power and discretion to order, or intercede to \nprevent a transfer as described herein, all PCMs are affected by this rampant and harmful \nemployment practice. \n115.  All PCMs will obtain a remedy should this Court order declaratory or injunctive relief and \ntake action to curb the MPD’s long-standing pattern and practice of retaliatory job transfers. \nMPD  CHIEFS  OF  POLICE  MAINTAIN  A  PATTERN  AND  PRACTICE  OF \nINSTIGATING, ORDERING, APPROVING AND CONDONING COORDINATED \nDISCIPLINARY CAMPAIGNS TO  PUSH  OUT BLACK  WOMEN OFFICERS \nWHO  OPPOSE  OR  COMPLAIN  ABOUT  RACE  OR  GENDER \nDISCRIMINATION OR MISCONDUCT \n \n22 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 23 of 208\n \n116.  MPD Chiefs of Police have final say in the termination of any police officer, or put another \nway, an MPD police officer will not be terminated without the Chief of Police’s direct or indirect \napproval. \n117.  When an MPD Chief of Police decides that he or she no longer wants a Black women \nofficer to be employed by the MPD, the Chief orchestrates and coordinates a campaign to push \nthat officer out. \n118.  The narratives of the CRPs clearly outline how these bullying, harassment and retaliation \ncampaigns are carried out.   \n119.  Black women officers who are no longer welcome at the MPD because they have opposed \nrace or gender discrimination and retaliation, are hyper-scrutinized (or “bird-dogged”) by their \nimmediate supervisors for every kind of minor issue or transgression, and are made to feel they \nare walking on eggshells.  See., e.g., factual narratives below of Plaintiffs Hampton, Mitchell, \nLockerman, Dickerson, Knight, and Carr. \n120.  This practice is so prevalent and such a part of the culture, that MPD officers have a slang \nterm for it: “being hot.”  When an officer is described as “being hot,” by and amongst other officers, \nit means that the officer has been targeted for reprisal and punitive treatment, and is used as a \nwarning to steer clear of that officer to avoid being collaterally damaged by the intentional \nretaliation aimed at the targeted officer.   \n121.  For the duration of the relevant period, MPC Chiefs of Police have been aware of, and have \ndirected their subordinates to execute campaigns that target an individual officer for removal from \nMPD. \n23 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 24 of 208\n \n122.  Black  women  officers  have  been  disproportionately  targeted  for  such  campaigns  of \nbullying,  isolation,  harassment  and  retaliation  for  complaining  about  race  and  gender \ndiscrimination, or for reporting fellow police officers for misconduct.  \n123.  Black women who become the subject of such campaigns are made to feel unwelcome and \nlike second class citizens. \n124.  Black women officers who are no longer welcome at the MPD are, and have been \nrepeatedly  disciplined  to  lower  their  performance  appraisal  rates  and  thereby  justify  their \nterminations.  See., e.g., factual narratives of Plaintiffs Brinkley, Knight. \n125.  IAD targeted and investigated Black women officers who opposed discrimination or \ncomplained about, or reported, misconduct; these same women have been ignored when they’ve \nsought redress for the coordinated retaliation against them. \n126.  MPD Police Chiefs are extremely effective in fashioning and executing these coordinated \ncampaigns to bully, harass and retaliate against Black women police officers, which causes a \ndisproportionate number of them to resign or retire early. \n127.  Black women who are targeted for retaliatory harassment are falsely accused of serious \nmisconduct and made to defend themselves against often-times outrageous accusations.  When \nthose accusations are proven to be unfounded, there is no redress of any kind.  See., e.g., factual \nnarratives of Plaintiffs Mitchell, Knight, Brown. \n128.  Black women police officers with decades of service to the MPD, once they become the \nsubject of a targeted bullying campaign, are found to be deficient in every category of performance, \nwith no explanation as to what caused the purported dramatic decline in performance.  See e.g., \nSee., e.g., factual narratives of Plaintiffs Brinkley, Mitchell, Clark, Carr, Knight. \n24 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 25 of 208\n \n129.  Black women officers who are targeted by the Chiefs of Police in such a fashion are bullied \nand harassed to such an extent that it adversely affects their mental and physical health, and places \nthem in a position in which leaving the MPD becomes the only way in which they can protect their \nmental and physical wellbeing.  See., e.g., factual narratives below of Plaintiffs Dickerson, \nBrinkely, Knight, Carr, Clark, and Brown. \n130.  Because of the complete and total dysfunction of the MPD EEO Office, Black women \nofficers are unable to obtain any kind of internal intervention to help protect their rights. \n131.  Those that obtain the benefit of union  representation  often encounter management’s \nintentional delay(s) and refusal(s) to provide information to the union. \n132.  When the union is successful in proving that the disciplinary action against a Black woman \nofficer was unjust, days or weeks later, the Black woman officer will be disciplined again for \nsomething else.   \n133.  The design and intention of the coordinated attacks by MPD Chiefs of Police is to make \nBlack women who oppose gender and race discrimination feel as if there is an incessant onslaught \nof harassment and bullying against them, that chokes the life out of their professional competencies \nand emotional strength such that it becomes  easier to simply give up.  MPD Chiefs of Police \napprove of, and use, such tactics for unlawful purposes and disproportionately against Black \nwomen officers. \n134.  MPD Police Chief tactics to push out Black women police officers constitute unlawful \nretaliation. \n135.  All CRPs have been affected by the MPD’s pattern, practice and/or custom of targeted \nharassment  and  bullying  in  retaliation  for  complaining  about  or  opposing  race  and  gender \ndiscrimination and police misconduct. \n25 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 26 of 208\n \n136.  Because of MPD’s top-down structure all PCMs are similarly affected by, and equally \nvulnerable to, its pattern, practice and/or custom of coordinated and targeted retaliatory bullying \nof Black women police officers. \n137.  All putative class members would obtain a remedy if the Court were to order declaratory \nand injunctive relief against the MPD, ordering it to cease and desist from engaging in coordinated \nbullying and harassment of Black women officers who oppose race and gender discrimination and \nretaliation.  \nFACTS COMMON TO THE CLASS RELATED TO MPD’S \nSYSTEMIC DISPARATE TREATMENT OF BLACK WOMEN OFFICERS  \nBASED ON RACE AND GENDER  \n \nMPD  MAINTAINS  A  PATTERN  AND  PRACTICE  OF  INTENTIONALLY \nDENYING PROMOTIONS TO BLACK WOMEN OFFICERS  \n \n138.  MPD’s process for promoting officers up the ranks disproportionately adversely affect \nBlack women police officers. \n139.  On information and belief, Black women are promoted less than any other group at MPD, \nthe disparity is statistically significant, and is the result of practices that amount to both disparate \ntreatment of, and disparate impact on Black women police officers. \n140.  Actual promotions are based on how many openings are available, and the ranking order \nof the results of the officers who took the promotion exam, which is published.  Thus, the highest \nperformer is ranked number one, the second number two, and so forth. \n141.  If, for example, a Department has three Lieutenant openings, in theory the top three \nperformers on the Lieutenant exam would be promoted into those roles. \n142.  However, MPD has maintained a pattern, practice and/or custom of filling openings with \n“Acting Officials” who are favored by the Chief of Police or the Departmental Commander, to \nforeclose or delay the promotion of a Black women officer who earned the promotion because of \n26 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 27 of 208\n \nher  performance  on  the  exam.  See.,  e.g.,  factual  narratives  below  of  Plaintiffs  Hampton, \nLockerman, and Dickerson.  Promotion delays adversely affect Black woman officers’ pay and \ncareer development opportunities.  \n143.  MPD Chiefs of Police have used this practice to harm Black women officers for the \nduration of the relevant period and to retaliate against Black women officers for complaining about \nrace or gender discrimination, and/or other police misconduct. \n144.  Because the Chief of Police has absolute discretion to make such determinations in all \nDepartments, all PCMs who seek promotions are affected by this pattern, practice, and/or custom. \n145.  All PCMs who seek to be promoted would obtain a complete remedy if a declaratory or \ninjunctive remedy was ordered that prohibited or severely restricted the practice of promoting \n“Acting Official” over fully qualified and promotion-eligible Black women police officers.  \n  MPD’S  PATTERN,  PRACTICE  AND/OR  CUSTOM  OF  DENYING  BLACK \nWOMEN OFFICERS CAREER DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES \n \n146.  MPD maintains a pattern, practice and/or custom of denying Black women officers the \nability to transfer into elite or desirable specialized units, particularly if they have complained \nabout race or gender discrimination, or have accused an officer of misconduct.  See., e.g., factual \nnarrative below of Plaintiff Carr. \n147.  Several of the MPD’s elite and most desirable units have physical requirements that all \nofficers have to meet. Some of the units administer physical fitness exams that determine who can \nbe assigned to them.  \n148.  MPD maintains a pattern, practice and/or custom of holding back those Black women \nofficers who do pass the physical requirements from transferring into the units they qualify for.   \n27 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 28 of 208\n \n149.  MPD denies these transfers to Black women officers if they are perceived to be “trouble-\nmakers,” i.e., someone who reports or opposes misconduct or discrimination.  See., e.g., factual \nnarratives below of Plaintiffs Knight, Brinkley, Mitchell, Carr, and Grier. \n150.  When Black women officers complain about being denied job opportunities, they are \nfurther retaliated against.   \n151.  Defendant maintains a pattern, practice and/or custom of allowing MPD management to \ndeny transfers and job opportunities to Black women officers without any legitimate explanation \nor business justification for doing so.   \n152.  This MPD policy, practice, and/or custom disproportionately harms Black women officers, \nand affects all PCMs in the same way. \n153.  All PCMs would obtain a remedy to a discriminatory and retaliatory practice if the Court \ngranted them declaratory and injunctive relief that requires MPD management to justify or explain \ndenials of requested job transfers to Black women officers when an opening is available. \nMPD’S  POLICY,  PATTERN  AND  PRACTICE,  AND/OR  CUSTOM  OF \nENFORCING  DISPARATE  DISCIPLINARY  STANDARDS  WHICH  FAVOR \nWHITE MALE OFFICERS \n \n154.  Upon information and belief, to a statistically significant degree, Black women officers are \ndisciplined more frequently, and face harsher punishments than white male officers, black male \nofficers, or white female officers for the same transgressions. \n155.  Upon information and belief, to a statistically significant degree, Black women officers are \nfrequently disciplined for actions that are not transgressions at all. \n156.  For example, when MPD suspected that Plaintiff Tabatha Knight had been recording some \nof her meetings with supervisors and management to protect herself from the onslaught of false \n28 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 29 of 208\n \naccusations made against her, she was subjected to an IAD investigation, and threatened with a \ntwenty-eight (28) day suspension.   \n157.  Plaintiff Knight’s recording of conversations did not violate District of Columbia law, nor  \nMPD policy. \n158.  Rather, Plaintiff Knight was investigated and threatened with suspension because any \nrecording could potentially prove malfeasance on the part of the parties she recorded. \n159.  Black women officers are also disciplined for infractions that they could not avoid, such as \nPlaintiff Brinkley, who was disciplined for not having her temperature taken when MPD posted \nno one to execute the COVID protocol task.   \n160.  Plaintiff Mitchell was disciplined for missing a call-out while she was on approved FMLA \nleave, and not meant to be disturbed because she was caring for a sick parent.   \n161.  Black women officers are disproportionately disciplined for alleged infractions that were \nbased on completely fictitious allegations.  See., e.g., factual narratives below of Plaintiffs Brown, \nKnight and Mitchell. \n162.  And when the claims are proved not only to be false but to have been made in bad faith, \nthe accuser is not disciplined.    \n163.  In sharp contrast to the rampant and free-flowing discipline of Black women officers, white  \nmale officers are highly favored and forgiven for very serious transgressions. \n164.  For example, on one occasion, a white male sergeant took out his penis and urinated into a \nbottle while riding in a police vehicle with a female officer, instead of asking to pull over and \nurinate in a bathroom or in the woods. See., e.g., factual narratives below of Plaintiffs Brinkley \nand Mitchell. Rather than being disciplined for this serious violation, the officer was promoted to \n29 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 30 of 208\n \nLieutenant shortly thereafter, and Plaintiff Mitchell  was retaliated against for making “a big deal” \nof it.  \n165.  MPD has maintained a pattern, practice, and custom of not only excusing misconduct from \nwhite male officers with respect to their conduct within the MPD, but also with respect to their \ninteractions with the community. \n166.  Upon information and belief, and to a statistically significant degree, white male officers \nare the subjects of more complaints of use of excessive force than any other group of officers at \nMPD. \n167.  However, they are not disciplined for their actions, even when the MPD is forced to \ncompensate the victims of their excessive force. \n168.  Several MPD officers were involved in a Facebook forum for the MPD that devolved into \na platform to attack and denigrate fellow officers.  Several male officers on the forum engaged in \nsystematic bullying of fellow officers based on race and gender. \n169.  IAD was ultimately asked to investigate the forum, and the forum was eventually shut \ndown.  Upon information and belief, not a single male officer involved in the cyber-bullying was \nheld to account for his actions.  \n170.  Upon information and belief, a second MPD officers Facebook forum currently exists, and \nMPD male officers continue to make racist and sexist comments.  \n171.  Upon information and belief, the MPD maintains a pattern, practice and custom of not \ntaking appropriate disciplinary action against officers who openly express racist and sexist views.  \nNor does it track or monitor whether those views affect the involved officers’ performance of their \npolicing duties as per the community at large or their fellow officers.  \n \n30 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 31 of 208\n \n  MPD HAS A PATTERN, PRACTICE AND CUSTOM OF CONDONING SEXUAL \nHARASSEMENT, SEX-BASED DISCRIMINATION AND MISCONDUCT, AND \nREWARDING  AND  PROTECTING  MALE  OFFICERS  WHO  ENGAGE  IN \nSEXUALLY INAPPROPRIATE CONDUCT OR SPEECH \n \n172.  As can be seen in the individual narratives of the CRP’s, MPD has a long history of \nprotecting men who sexually harass Black women police officers.  See., e.g., factual narratives \nbelow of Plaintiffs Dickerson, Hampton, Knight, and Grier. \n173.  It also has a pattern, practice and custom of being dismissive of sexually charged language \nor “locker-room talk” in police meetings and gatherings in which women officers are present, thus \ncondoning and encouraging officers to use inappropriate and patently sexist language in the \nworkplace.   \n174.  When  Black  women  police  officers  have  complained  about  sexual  harassment,  or \ninappropriate sexist language, they have been targeted for retaliation by their supervisors; when \nthey seek intervention by the upper chain of command, their complaints are dismissed or ignored.   \n175.  MPD’s Chiefs of Police have the authority and the capacity to instill a zero-tolerance policy \nthroughout MPD for the use of sexist language, locker room talk, and abusive and denigrating \ncomments.  To date, the MPD Chiefs of Police who have presided during the relevant period, have \nnot set or enforced such a policy. \n176.  On the contrary, they have instilled and perpetuated a culture permissive of denigration \nand disrespect, one that welcomes and promotes bullying, retaliation, isolation, targeting and \nharassment of Black women officers who oppose such sexist and discriminatory speech and \nactions. \n177.  All of the CRPs have identified this abusive, sexist culture as a central component of the \nhostile work environment created for Black women police officers.   \n178.  All PCMs are subjected to the same culture and social dynamics within the MPD. \n31 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 32 of 208\n \n179.  All PCMs would obtain a remedy if the Court were to grant declaratory and injunctive \nrelief to the class, and mandate that the MPD Chiefs of Police issue new policy with respect to \nappropriate tone and culture for professionals at the MPD. \n180.  All class members would obtain a remedy if the Court were to grant declaratory and \ninjunctive relief to the class with respect to mandating that the MPD cease and desist retaliating \nagainst Black women officers who complain of, or oppose the use of sexist and derogatory \nlanguage by MPD officers. \n181.  All class members would obtain a remedy if the Court were to grant declaratory and \ninjunctive relief to the class with respect to mandating that the MPD revamp its EEO Office, and \nupdate its EEO counseling and investigative policies and practices. \nMPD  HAS  A  PATTERN,  PRACTICE  AND  CUSTOM  OF  WITHHOLDING \nRESOURCES  FROM  BLACK  WOMEN  POLICE  OFFICERS  AND \nUNDERMINING THEIR AUTHORITY AND ABILITY TO EXECUTE THEIR \nDUTIES \n \n182.  As part of  its culture,  pattern, practice and custom of treating Black women police officers \nas second-class citizens, the MPD routinely provides Black women police officers poor, or \ninappropriate equipment.  See., e.g., factual narratives below of Plaintiffs Brinkley, Mitchell, and \nClark. \n183.  In one case it assigned a pair of Black women police officers a flea-infested vehicle and \nrefused to permit them to use a cleaner or better car.   \n184.  In another instance MPD refused to provide a Black female officer with the appropriate \nvehicle to execute her duties on a presidential detail.   \n185.  Black women police officers promoted into management roles are given less resources than \ntheir colleagues and are placed in control over smaller and/or less desirable districts, divisions and \ndepartments. See., e.g., factual narratives of Plaintiffs Dickerson & Lockerman. \n32 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 33 of 208\n \n186.  MPD  management  often  undermines  the  authority  of  Black  women  officers  in  the \nmanagement structure by allowing or encouraging insubordination, usurping discretion form \nBlack women officers, and sabotaging their management decisions.  See., e.g., factual narratives \nbelow of Plaintiffs Lockerman, Hampton, and Dickerson. \n187.  When Black women officers complain about disparate treatment in the provision of \ndepartment resources, they are at best, ignored, and more often, retaliated against. \n188.  The claims of the class representative plaintiffs with respect to being denied appropriate \ngear, vehicles, staff and other resources, to execute their duties safely and adequately, are typical \nof the claims of the PCMs, such that resolution on a class basis will remedy all claims.   \nRULE 23 FACTORS \nRULE 23(a) FACTORS \n   NUMEROSITY \n189.  At the time of this filing, the exact number of the members of the class is not known.  \nPlaintiffs will seek appropriate pre-certification discovery to ascertain the exact number.  On \ninformation and belief, based on the current number of Black women officers employed by the \nMPD, and the estimated rate of turn-over, the putative class would be in excess of minimally \nseven hundred (700) putative class members. \n190.  That number well exceeds the standard for meeting the numerosity standard, and the \ninterest of judicial efficiency will clearly be served by class treatment of the claims herein. \n191.  Joinder of the cases is impractical, inefficient, and likely to deny justice to the class, \ninasmuch as the substantial potential for retaliation against litigants from the MPD would dissuade \nputative plaintiffs from filing individual actions. \n \n33 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 34 of 208\n \nCOMMONALITY \n192.  Plaintiffs reassert all the factual allegations in the paragraphs above as if fully restated \nherein. \n193.  The questions of fact common to the class are outlined in the factual section above.  \n194.  The questions of law common to the class include, but are not limited to, the following: \na.  Whether MPD’s practice of systematic retaliation against Black women police \nofficers who complain about race or sex discrimination, or misconduct violates the law and \nPlaintiffs’ civil rights? \nb.  Whether MPD maintenance of an EEO office predisposed to dismiss and invalidate \nany and all claims of discrimination or workplace harassment violates federal and DC law? \nc.  Whether MPD permitting an EEO Director to make false statements in EEO \ninvestigations, and to violate confidentiality to chill and discourage the use of the EEO \nprocess violates federal and DC law? \nd.  Whether MPD’s used of an overbroad NDA to prevent EEO Department employees \nfrom reporting unlawful EEO violates federal and DC law. \ne.  Whether  MPD’s  practice  of  promoting  male  officers  into  “Acting  Official” \npositions in order to deny or delay promotions for Black women officers violates federal \nand DC law?  \nf.  Whether MPD’s use of the IAD’s investigative process to retaliate against Black \nwomen officers who complain about race or gender discrimination, or police misconduct \nviolates federal and DC law? \ng.  Whether  MPD’s  systematic  withholding  of  desirable  assignments,  and  career \ngrowth opportunities from Black women officers is a violation of federal and DC law?  \n34 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 35 of 208\n \nh.  Whether MPD’s custom and culture of permitting male officers to use sexist and \nsexually charged language in the workplace, creates a hostile work environment for women \nofficers, according to the law? \ni.  Whether Defendant breached a duty to Plaintiffs by failing to monitor and manage \nthe MPD EEO Department, thus allowing it to violate Plaintiffs’ civil rights?  \nj.  Whether Defendant’s pattern, practice and/or custom of involuntarily transferring \nBlack women officers who report race or gender discrimination, or police misconduct \nviolates the DC Whistleblower law?  \nk.  Whether MPD’s systematic bullying and retaliation against Black women officers \nwho testify before the DC City Council, or who informed the Mayor’s office of race or \ngender discrimination, or police misconduct, violates DC law?   \nTYPICALITY \n195.  As can be seen in the individual narratives and claims infra, while all Plaintiffs do not have \nthe exact same story, they do all have the same experience with MPD management and the MPD \nEEO Department. \n196.  The CRPs who complained to EEO were subject to the same treatment and their respective \nclaims were similarly ignored, minimized, and dismissed. Their claims are typical of all Black \nwomen officers who attempted to report workplace complaints to MPD’s EEO Department in \norder to resolve their discrimination claims.  \n197.  The CRPs who complained to their managers and supervisors about disparate and unfair \ntreatment were treated in precisely the same way.  Their claims are typical of all Black women \nofficers who sought help from their management leaders, and were rebuffed or ignored. \n35 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 36 of 208\n \n198.  The CRPs who became the subject of a campaign to be pushed out of the MPD, were all \nthe victims of the whims of the Chief of Police, and were treated in the exact same way.  Their \nclaims are typical of the many Black women officers who have been similarly targeted by the \nChiefs of Police and harassed and pressured into resigning or prematurely retiring.  \n199.  The CRPs who were subjected to a work environment rife with sexist and sexually charged \nlanguage were all dismissed when they complained about it. Their claims are typical of all the \nBlack women who were forced to endure a sexually charged and sexist work environment. \n200.  The  CRPs  who  were  investigated  or  threatened  with  investigation  in  retaliation  for \ncomplaining about race and gender discrimination, or police misconduct, have claims that are \ntypical of all Black women officers who were so targeted. \nADEQUACY OF REPRESENTATION \n201.  The cadre of CRPs are made up of Black women that represent or have experience in all \ncomponents of MPD.  Two are management employees.  Four are Senior Police Officers.  Three \nare currently employed sworn officers.  Three are recently retired.  One was terminated in \nretaliation  for  opposing  discrimination.    One  worked  in  the  Academy  for  long  enough  to \nadequately represent academy-level trainees. \n202.  The CRPs are from a variety of departments, and all have substantial experience on the \nforce.  Combined, they have over 100 years of professional police experience. \n203.  One CRP is a member of the Senior Executive Leadership Team of the MPD, and has a \nunique perspective on how senior management, and especially Chiefs of Police, wield their power.  \n204.  Class Counsel, Temple Law Offices, has been in operation in the District of Columbia \nsince 1991 and known to represent victims of workplace wrongs and commercial discrimination. \nDonald M. Temple has practiced law for more than 42 years, 31 years in private practice.  He has \n36 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 37 of 208\n \nsuccessfully litigated multiple civil rights and workplace-based race discrimination to successful \njury verdicts in the D.C. and Maryland federal courts which include  Squires v. District of \nColumbia,  Eric  Payne  vs.  the  District  of  Columbia  et  al.,  Case  No.  10-cv-00679-PLF \n(USDC)(after  eight  years  of  litigation);  Proctor  et  al.  v.  Washington  Suburban  Sanitation \nCommission; Laura Jackson v. District of Columbia Department of Health, et, al., Case No. 2013 \nCA 003442 P(MPA) (DCSC) (after nine years of litigation).   \n205.  Attorney Temple has also obtained successful appellate reversals in both the D.C. state and \nfederal courts, the Fourth Circuit, and the United States Supreme Court including, but not limited \nto,  the  following  decisions:    Linwood  Q.  Ham  et  al.  v.  Washington  Suburban  Sanitation \nCommission, Appeal No, 04-2021  (CA4thCircuit), Stephanie Brown v. Allen Sessoms, President \nUniversity of District of Columbia, Case No. 13-Y7027 (US Court of Appeals,   DC Circuit), \nNanko Shipping, USA, Parent Company of Nanko Shipping Guinea, et al., v. ALCOA, INC., Alcoa \nWorld Alumina, CASE No. 15-7070 (US Court of Appeals for DC), Capital Services Management, \nInc. v. Vesta Corporation (US Court of Appeals D.C. Circuit), and Stephanie Artis v. District of \nColumbia (Co-Counsel), United States Supreme Court.       \n206.  Class Counsel, Pamela Keith, has been a labor and employment attorney for twenty-one \n(21)  years.    She  worked  at  some  of  the  most  prestigious  labor  and  employment  firms  in \nWashington, DC: Jones Day, Morgan Lewis & Bockius and Ogletree Deakins, prior to joining \nTemple Law Offices.  Attorney Keith worked extensively on one of the largest class actions in \nAmerican history (Dukes, et al. v. Walmart) while employed with Jones Day, and spent years \nworking extensively on Rule 23 litigation.  \n207.  Temple Law Offices have the experience, reputation, and stability to adequately represent \nthe interests of the litigants and the putative class. \n37 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 38 of 208\n \n \nRULE 23(b)(2) FACTORS \n208.  Plaintiffs reassert all the factual allegations in the paragraphs above as if fully restated \nherein. \n209.  While the CRPs do have individual claims for which they seek redress, certification of the \nputative class under Rule 23(b) is appropriate because declaratory and injunctive relief will provide \na remedy to all PCMs with respect to MPD policies and practices that violate the law.  \n210.  The fact that MDP is a top-down chain of command structure ensures that unlawful or \ndiscriminatory policies and practices that emanate from the Chiefs of Police are carried out by \ntheir subordinates through the entire enterprise. \n211.  Conversely, discriminatory acts or practices engaged in by individual officers, through acts \nof individual discretion, can be mitigated or reversed by the Chief of Police.  Thus, the failure to \nintercede and stop reported and documented individual acts of discrimination and retaliation, is a \nfailure that can be remedied by declaratory, injunctive and affirmative means.  \n212.  Thus, declaratory, injunctive and affirmative relief to the entire class flows directly and \nautomatically from proof of the facts herein, and the establishment that such facts constitute \nviolations of the law. \n213.  The  entitlement  to  declaratory,  injunctive  and  affirmative  relief  to  the  entire  class \nnecessarily predominates the litigation, and provides a one-time remedy to all officers negatively \naffected by the unlawful policies and practices described herein. \n214.  Furthermore, the entitlement to declaratory, injunctive and affirmative relief forms the \nfactual and legal predicate for appropriate monetary damages as well as non-monetary remedies \nfor individual losses caused by the systemic and enterprise-wide unlawful conduct at MPD.  \n38 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 39 of 208\n \n215.  Thus, certification of the class to test and answer the questions of law and fact common to \nthe class is appropriate, inasmuch as final legal resolution of those question will provide remedy \nand closure for both the putative class and the MPD. \nRULE 23(b)(3) FACTORS \n216.  What is clear from the factual allegations herein is that nearly all that has transpired to the \nCRPs,  and  thus  to  the  putative  class,  is  the  result  of  deeply  embedded  race  and  gender \ndiscrimination, exacerbated by a profound culture of silencing, bullying and intimidating those \nwho complain about their respective and similar victimization. \n217.  There is no real or meaningful way for the putative class to otherwise obtain relief but \nthrough the class action process. \n218.  The MPD has been sued numerous times during the relevant period for race and gender \ndiscrimination and retaliation; none of those cases have produced any meaningful cultural or \nsystemic change with respect to its treatment of Black women police officers. \n219.  If, in this litigation, Plaintiffs are able to prove the allegations herein, then the declaratory, \ninjunctive and affirmative relief that flows therefrom will not simply remedy the injustice to them, \nit will modify policy, procedures, practices, customs, and modes of accountability.  This will  \nensure that future Black women police officers won’t have to endure the same hostile, sexist, racist \nand retaliatory environment that presently exists.  \n220.  This is precisely what the class action vehicle was designed to achieve, and why it is \nsuperior to any other available means for the adjudication of the claims of the CRPs or the class \nmembers. \n221.  Discovery related to the key decision-makers at MPD, and their policies and practices, is \nbest done once, on a class wide basis, rather than dozens or hundreds of times, for each litigant.  \n39 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 40 of 208\n \nSuch would be incredibly expensive, as well as time consuming and distracting for the key \ndecision-makers.  \n222.  Allowing this matter to proceed as a class action will achieve economies of scale and cost, \nminimize the use of court recourses and time, ensure a consistent result applicable to all members \nof the class, and ensure that declaratory and injunctive relief provides a resolution that can move \nforward and prevent future claims.  \n223.  Plaintiffs intend to communicate with the PCMs via electronic and regular mailings to last \nknown street address and email address, and any other method ordered by the court. Defendant is \nin possession of all information necessary to inform the PCMs of this action, and to inform them \nof their options as determined by this Court.  \nRULE 23(b)(5) FACTORS \n224.  Plaintiffs represent bargaining unit and non-bargaining unit members, sworn officers and \nSenior Police Officers, and management and executive officers.   \n225.  As deemed appropriate by this Court after conducting pre-certification discovery, Plaintiffs \nwill seek the establishment of sub-classes to dispose of individual claims more efficiently. \n     CLASS CAUSES OF ACTION \n226.  On behalf of themselves and the putative class (and/or appropriate sub-classes) of all \nsimilarly situated Black women police officers who are currently employed by the MPD, or who \nhave  been  employed  by  the  MPD  between  January  1,  2011,  and  the  present,  the  class-\nrepresentative Plaintiffs assert the following CLAIMS. \nRACE DISCRIMATION CLAIMS \nCOUNT I \nViolation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e, et seq., \n40 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 41 of 208\n \nCOUNT II \nViolation of the District of Columbia Human Rights Act \nDistrict of Columbia Code § 2-1401.01 et seq. \nCOUNT III \nViolation of the Civil Rights Act of 1866 \nDiscrimination Based on Race in the Making and Enforcing of Contracts \n42 U.S.C. §1981(a) by way of, through and via 42 U.S.C. § 1983 \n227.  MPD discriminated against Plaintiffs and the putative class of Black women police officers \non the basis of race, by way of maintaining a system-wide pattern and practice of disparate \ntreatment against Black women officers on the basis of race, creating and maintain a work \nenvironment hostile to Black women officers on the basis of race, fostering an EEO Office \ninherently and irredeemably hostile to Black women officers on the basis of race, denying \npromotion and career development opportunities to Black women officers, subjecting them to \ndisparate  disciplinary  standards,  undermining  the  rank  and  authority  of  Black  women, \nsystematically  disparaging  the  character  and  credibility  of  Black  women  officers,  and \nsystematically refusing to investigate or take seriously claims of discrimination lodged by Black \nwomen officers due to their race. \n228.  MPD perpetuates and maintains a pattern and practice of systematic retaliation against \nBlack women police officers who oppose, complain about or report race discrimination. \nSEX DISCRIMINATION CLAIMS \nCOUNT IV \nViolation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e, et seq., \nCOUNT V \nViolation of the District of Columbia Human Rights Act \nDistrict of Columbia Code § 2-1401.01 et seq. \n \n41 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 42 of 208\n \n229.  The MPD discriminated against Plaintiffs and the putative class of Black women police \nofficers on the basis of sex, in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, \n42 U.S.C. § 2000e, et seq., by way of maintaining a system-wide pattern and practice of disparate \ntreatment against Black women officers on the basis of sex, creating and maintain a work \nenvironment hostile to Black women officers on the basis of sex, fostering an EEO Office \ninherently and irredeemably hostile to Black women officers on the basis of sex, and systematically \nrefusing to investigate or take seriously claims of discrimination lodged by Black women officers \ndue to their sex. \n230.  MPD perpetuates and maintains a pattern and practice of systematic retaliation against \nBlack women police officers who oppose, complain about or report sex discrimination or sexual \nharassment. \nADDITIONAL CLAIMS \nCOUNT VI \n \nViolation of the District of Columbia Whistleblower Protection Act \nD.C. Code § 1-615-51 et seq. \n \n231.  Pursuant  to  the  D.C.  Whistleblower  Protection  Act,  Defendant  is  prohibited  from \nreassigning, terminating or otherwise retaliating against a D.C. government employee as a result \nof that employee’s protected disclosures that the employee reasonably believes show gross \nmismanagement, gross misuse or waste of government resources, and abuse of authority in the \nconnection with the administration of a government program, or a violation of a state, local or \nfederal law, rule or regulation. \n232.  Defendant violated this Act by, in a coordinated and systematic way, retaliating against \nBlack  women  officers  whose  protective  disclosures  included  among  others,  the  following:    \n42 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 43 of 208\n \nallegations of discrimination to their superiors in MPD, in testimony before the City Council, and \ndirect communications to the Office of the Mayor about rampant racism, sexism, retaliation as \nwell as police misconduct.  \n233.  Defendant engaged in a pattern, practice, and custom of retaliation against those who \ncomplained to Superiors inside and outside side the confined of the MPD, and improperly used the \nIAD investigatory process to threaten and intimidate Black women officers into remaining silent, \nand investigating those who chose to come forward. \nCOUNT VII \nFailure to Train, Supervise and Discipline Officers  \nResponsible for Continuous Violations  \nof  Departmental Policies, General Orders, and  Plaintiffs’ Civil and Constitutional Rights \n \n234.  Plaintiffs incorporate and restate all information and allegations contained in the preceding \nparagraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n235.  MPD management maintains an enterprise-wide culture, pattern and practice of subjecting \nBlack women officers to false accusations, unfair and disparate treatment and discipline, unfair \nand  unjustified  changes  to  job  assignments  and  duties,  retaliatory  investigations  and  other \nviolations of their civil and constitutional rights. \n236.  Defendant fosters a culture and environment where such violations were not only allowed \nto occur, but were encouraged and fully tolerated. \n237.  On multiple occasions, Plaintiffs complained of this systemic violation of their civil and \nconstitutional rights, going up their chain of command, all the way to the Chief of Police, the \nMayor and City Council. \n238.  None  of  the  entities  to  which  Plaintiffs  complained  took  any  action  to  address  the \ncontinuous violation of their civil and constitutional rights.  \n43 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 44 of 208\n \n239.  Plaintiffs assert that the District of Columbia owed them a duty of proper supervision of its \nMPD leadership, and that it has a responsibility to investigate and properly respond to their claims \nand concerns, which it, on multiple occasions, failed to do.  MPD Departments policies and \nprocedures, including its General Orders, as well as DC Municipal Regulations, require certain \nspecific supervisory protocols for honesty, accuracy, and completeness, among other things. \n240.  On multiple occasions, when it became clear that a member of the MPD made false or \nsalacious accusations against Plaintiffs, Defendant failed to properly discipline those persons, \nallowing them to remain in positions of power, and to continue to engage in violations of Plaintiffs’ \ncivil and constitutional rights. \n241.  On multiple occasions, when it became clear that a member of the MPD had engaged in \nunlawful retaliation against Plaintiffs for engaging in constitutionally protected activity, Defendant \nfailed to intercede, take appropriate remedial action, or admonish or discipline such persons. \n242.  Plaintiffs assert that Defendant owed them a duty and had a responsibility to properly \nsupervise MPD leadership and officers consistent with its policies and procedures, general orders, \nand DC Municipal Regulations, and that it failed to do so when it failed to hold persons accountable \nfor retaliating against Plaintiffs for engaging in constitutionally protected activity.  \n243.  The duty that Defendant owed to Plaintiffs to properly supervise and hold accountable the \nmanagement of the MPD extends equally to all members of the putative class of Black women \npolice officers.  \n244.  As a direct and proximate cause of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiffs suffered significant \neconomic harm in the form of loss of employment, corresponding salary, loss of employment \nopportunities, and damage to their professional reputation, and significant mental and emotional \ndistress.  \n44 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 45 of 208\n \n245.  The losses, damages and injuries suffered by Plaintiffs are a direct and proximate result of \nDefendant’s negligent supervision of the Chief of Police, the MPD EEO Office, and other MPD \nsenior leaders are common and typical of the harms suffered by the PCMs in this matter. \n246.  All PCMs would obtain a remedy if this Court were to grant declaratory, injunctive, and \ncompensatory relief to the class as a remedy for harms caused by Defendants’ breach of the duty \nowed to the class to properly supervise MPD management. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF ON BEHALF OF THE CLASS \nWHEREFORE, PLAINTIFFS, upon certification of the class/classes in accordance with the \nrequest herein, seek the following compensatory, declarative, and injunctive relief: \nCOMPENSATORY RELIEF \n247.  An ORDER mandating that Defendant establish a fund to compensate the CRPs and PCMs \nof no less than $100,000,000.00. \n248.  An ORDER appointing Class Counsel as administrator of the fund.  \n249.  An ORDER granting Class Counsel attorney’s fees as agreed to by and between the CRPs \nand Class Counsel.  \n250.  Any and all such additional compensatory remedies as deemed appropriate by this Court. \nDECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n251.  An ORDER declaring that the MPD’s employment policies, practices and procedures \ntowards Black women police officers constitute unlawful discrimination and retaliation and \nviolate the laws cited herein.  \n252.  An ORDER permanently enjoining the MPD from engaging in discrimination based on \nrace. \n45 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 46 of 208\n \n253.  An ORDER permanently enjoining the MPD from engaging in discrimination based on \ngender. \n254.  An ORDER appointing a Special Master to temporarily take over personnel management \nof the MPD, and to re-vamp and re-write the MPD’s personnel and EEO policies and procedures, \nand that places the EEO Department directly under the Special Master’s supervision and control. \n255.  An ORDER mandating a full and complete audit by the Special Master of the MPD’s \ndisciplinary  practices,  and  the  drafting  by  the  Special  Master  of  a  report  to  the  Court  on \nrecommended changes to ensure fair, equitable and non-discriminatory discipline of employees. \n256.  An ORDER mandating a full and complete audit by the Special Master of the MPD’s \nInternal Affairs Department, and the drafting by the Special Master of a report to the Court on \nrecommended changes to IAD to ensure the investigative function is no longer weaponized to \nretaliate  against  Black  women  officers  who  complain  about  or  oppose  race  or  gender \ndiscrimination, or police misconduct. \n257.  An ORDER mandating that the Special Master conduct a full and complete audit of the \nMPD’s promotion and assignment practices, and that the Special Master makes recommendations \nto the Court on changes to such policies and procedures to ensure that Black women are no longer \ndenied promotions or career opportunities. \n258.  An ORDER mandating that the Special Master provide the Court recommendations on \nmethods  of  retraining  police  officers  to  cease  using,  accepting,  perpetuating,  enabling  or \ncondoning harassment, bullying or retaliation as a means of silencing dissent and complaints. \n259.  An ORDER mandating that the Special Master provides the Court recommendations on \npolicies, procedures and best practices to ensure that Black women officers who are promoted into \n46 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 47 of 208\n \nmanagement are supported in their roles, and are not usurped of authority, or denied the personnel \nor resources necessary to execute their duties. \n260.  An ORDER to the Mayor, creating a new role in the Mayor’s Office of “Liaison to the \nMPD on Civil Rights and Social Justice.”  The purpose and role of the Liaison Officer would be \nto provide an independent assessment of allegations of discrimination within the MPD, or with \nrespect to treatment of the community by the MPD, that is not predicated on principally defending \nthe Mayor or the District of Columbia from liability for misconduct or unlawful acts.  The role of \nthe Liaison Officer will be to identify and raise to the Mayor’s awareness, cases and circumstances \nwhen the benefit of the public is best served by affirmative intercession by the Mayor’s Office to \nattain and ensure justice and equality. \n261.  An ORDER mandating that the MPD immediately cease and desist from using coordinated \nharassment, “bird-dogging,” frivolous and frequent discipline, and bullying as a means of forcing \nout Black women police officers who complain about discrimination or retaliation. \n262.  An  ORDER  mandating  that  the  Special  Master  draft  and  present  to  the  Court \nrecommendations for ensuring that Black women who are whistleblowers are not retaliated \nagainst. \n263.  An ORDER mandating that the Special Master remains in his/her oversight role until such \ntime as the Court is satisfied that the pattern and practice of race and gender discrimination and \nretaliation at MPD has been severed, and that all MPD officers are being treated fairly and in \naccordance with the laws of the Unite States and the District of Columbia. \n264.  Any and all additional declaratory and injunctive relief as deemed appropriate by this \nCourt. \n \n47 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 48 of 208\n \n                                        FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS AND CLAIMS \nOF THE INDIVIDUAL PLAINTIFFS \n \n                PLAINTIFF BRINKLEY’S INDIVIDUAL CLAIMS \n       Facts Related to Plaintiff Brinkley’s Individual Claims \n265.  Plaintiff Brinkley began her employment with MPD in October 1988.  She initially was \nassigned to the Morals Division and later to Patrol District One.   \n266.  In 1992, she was chosen for, and assigned to the Special Operations Division (hereinafter \n“SOD”) as an Emergency Response Team (hereinafter “ERT”) Station Clerk.   \n267.  That same year, Plaintiff Brinkley married fellow MPD officer, Matthew Brinkley.  They \nboth served on the MPD until 2014, when Mr. Brinkley retired.  Plaintiff Brinkley continued \nworking at the MPD well after he retired.  \n268.  The ERT unit of the MPD deals with hostage situations and other volatile and delicate \ncircumstances where a person might be barricaded in a building, refusing to cooperate with officer \ndemands, or holding hostages. \n269.  ERT is an elite unit, and considered a desirable and sought-after assignment.  Officers are \nscreened and chosen for their suitability to ERT and are trained in crisis management and tactics. \n270.  After about eighteen years in ERT as a negotiator, Plaintiff Brinkley was assigned to the \nDC Public Schools, and served there for approximately two years.  \n271.  To round out her policing experience, Plaintiff Brinkley requested and was reassigned to a \nPatrol District.   \n272.  From approximately 2012 to November of 2016, Plaintiff Brinkley served continuously in \nthe First District Patrol unit without any complaint from her management about her performance.   \n273.  In November of 2016 Plaintiff Brinkley chose to retire from the MPD.  \n48 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 49 of 208\n \n274.  In March of 2017, Plaintiff Brinkley was asked to return to active policing because MPD \nneeded to increase its officer headcount, most especially with respect to seasoned officers with \nspecialized training and skills. \n275.  At  the  time,  MPD  was  bringing  back  strong  and  experienced  officers  as  full-time \nemployees, but employed them by way of individual contracts, not as members of the FOP \nbargaining unit. \n276.  MPD offered Plaintiff Brinkley a contract to return as a Senior Police Officer (hereinafter \n“SPO”) within SOD to assist in the selection process and training of new reserve negotiators.  \n277.  Plaintiff Brinkley’s contract was for a year, renewable annually if she remained able to \nmeet physical and other requirements.  \n278.  Plaintiff Brinkley began her second stint as a DC Police Officer on April 3, 2017, assigned \nto ERT as a negotiator.   \n279.  At  the  time,  her  immediate  supervisor,  and  the  person  responsible  for  her  actual \nassignments was Sergeant Kevin O’Bryant (hereinafter “Sgt. O’Bryant”). \n280.  However, because ERT was a specialized unit, it had its own administrative chain of \ncommand, responsible for coordination, logistics and allocation of resources such as vehicles and \nprotective equipment.  \n281.  At that time, the administrative Sergeant for ERT was Sergeant Michael Boyd (hereinafter \n“Sgt. Boyd.” \n282.  Plaintiff Brinkley’s partner at the time was officer Kia Mitchell who is a co-Plaintiff in this \ncase, (hereinafter “Plaintiff Mitchell”).   \n49 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 50 of 208\n \n283.  Plaintiff  Brinkley  had  served  and  partnered  with  Plaintiff  Mitchell  during  her  first \nemployment with MPD for approximately twenty years.  They were close confidants, and often \nshared private matters with each other.  \n284.  Sgt. Boyd treated Plaintiff Brinkley and SPO Mitchell more harshly and negatively than \nany other officers in the unit, and more harshly than other non-Black female officers, and used his \nauthority and position to make things difficult and unpleasant for them.  \n285.  On or about May 2017 he assigned Plaintiff Brinkley and SPO Mitchell vehicles that had \nbeen used by the K-9 unit and had been infested with fleas.   \n286.  Plaintiff Brinkley and SPO Mitchell used the vehicle for a few days, but then notice’s the \nflea bites and resultant rashes, and asked Sgt. Boyd for different vehicles.   \n287.  Plaintiff Brinkley asserts, and on information and belief, there were other vehicles available \nat the time located on the top parking lot of SOD.   \n288.  Despite multiple requests, and having other options, Sgt. Boyd obstinately refused to assign \nPlaintiff Brinkley and her partner different vehicles.   \n289.  Sgt. Boyd’s recalcitrance with respect to Plaintiff’s request was disparate and unlike his \nresponse to requests from non-Black female officers and male officers. \n290.  On or about June 2017, Plaintiff Brinkley and SPO Mitchell went to the SOD Lieutenant, \nKenny Taylor (Black male) (hereinafter “Lt. Taylor”), Sgt. Boyd’s superior, and complained about \nthe fact that Sgt. Boyd refused to assign them a clean and un-infested vehicle.   \n291.  To remedy their concerns, Lt. Taylor allowed them to use the ERT Suburban, a large and \ncomfortable vehicle.  \n50 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 51 of 208\n \n292.  Plaintiff Brinkley and SPO Mitchell were driving in the Suburban when they received an \nirate phone call from Sgt. Boyd, demanding that they return the Suburban, despite the fact that his \nsuperior had authorized Plaintiff Brinkley and her partner to use the Suburban.  \n293.  From that point on, and for months thereafter, Sgt. Boyd undertook a campaign to retaliate \nagainst, undermine, isolate, spread false claims against and harass Plaintiff Brinkley and SPO \nMitchell. Given his seniority and position of authority, Sgt. Boyd was able to effectively execute \nhis scheme to retaliate against Plaintiff Brinkley and SPO Mitchell because he saw them virtually \nevery day and was in regular contact with their fellow officers.  \n294.  On or about July 9, 2019, Plaintiff Brinkley tragically and suddenly lost her husband and \nlifetime partner to an aneurysm.  \n295.  The loss was devastating to her, and she exhausted all of her accumulated sick and annual \nleave while on bereavement leave from the MPD.  \n296.  During her bereavement leave, Plaintiff Brinkley suffered from anxiety and depression, \nand sought the care of a medical professional and spiritual guidance to help manage her mental \nhealth challenges. \n297.  Plaintiff Brinkley returned to work on or about September 23, 2019, but was still struggling \nwith depression, and sleeplessness. She did seek counseling from the MPD-provided counseling \nservice, as well as private counseling and medical care.  \n298.  On or about September 24, 2019, Plaintiff Brinkley entered the roll call room for a major \ndetail assignment.  At the time the room was full of officers in formal uniform.  This triggered \nthoughts of her late-husband and her grief overwhelmed her in that moment.  Her sobbing and \nemotional pain caused her to hyperventilate, and struggle with breathing.   \n51 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 52 of 208\n \n299.  An ambulance was called, and upon arriving, the paramedics took her vital signs.  By then, \nher breathing had improved, and SPO Mitchell offered to take Plaintiff Brinkley home.  \n300.  Plaintiff Brinkley returned to work a few days later.  When she did, SPO Mitchell and \nOfficer Tabatha Knight (Black female) (hereinafter “Officer Knight”), informed her superior, \nLieutenant Darnell Robinson (hereinafter “Lt. Robinson”) had made derogatory comments about \nher extreme grief, had publicly denigrated her for exhibiting symptoms of depression and anxiety, \nand had threatened to send Plaintiff Brinkley for a fitness for duty evaluation.   \n301.  Plaintiff Brinkley was shocked to hear and learn that her superior held her in such low \nesteem that he would speak in a denigrating manner about her disability.  \n302.  Plaintiff Brinkley further understood that Lt. Robinson had no concern for her, or her well-\nbeing, and that she needed to hide her symptoms or face retaliation, or discrimination based on her \ndisability.  Lt. Robinson’s comments made clear that he disfavored Plaintiff as a result of her \ndisability. \n303.  Plaintiff Brinkley’s experiences with Sgt. Boyd marked the first time in her 26-year MPD \ncareer that she was personally singled out for the systematic, orchestrated and intentional micro-\naggressive retaliation that has become a cancer in the MPD that targets Black women officers, and \nparticularly harms those who complain about the disparate and unfair treatment they endure. \n304.  On or about December 14, 2018, Plaintiff’s supervisor, Sgt. O’Bryant, left ERT SOD and \nwas reassigned to the Mayor’s detail.  Sgt. O’Bryant was known as a devout Christian, and very \nprofessional officer.  He ensured that people in his department adhered to a high level of decorum \nand respect for each other.   \n305.  Upon his departure, the culture of ERT changed dramatically. \n52 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 53 of 208\n \n306.  Sgt. O’Bryant was replaced by Sgt. John Brown (Black male) sometime in June of 2019, \nwho had a totally different leadership style.  Sgt. Brown was far more permissive and tolerant of \nunprofessional and inappropriate comments, most especially by male officers towards female \nofficers. \n307.  Upon the change in leadership, it became a common occurrence for officers in SOD to use \nfoul language and make inappropriate sexual comments.  Plaintiff Brinkley had raised concerns \nabout the declining professionalism of the unit to Sgt. Brown, but he ignored her concerns.   \n308.  SOD roll call is an official meeting of officers on their shifts to discuss assignments and \nshare information from previous shifts or other units.  Roll call is also an opportunity for \ndepartment  leaders  to  check-in  with  their  officers  and  receive  feed-back  and  give  daily \ninstructions, updates and important information.  \n309.  Roll call is also an opportunity for officers to see and engage with their colleagues.  \nBecause officers disperse during their shifts, roll call can be the only place where officers get to \nknow each other.  \n310.  On or about February 4, 2020, Plaintiff was the only female officer in a roll call meeting \nconducted by Sgt. Thomas Miller (White male) (hereinafter Sgt. Miller) and Sgt. Brown.  \n311.  When Sgt. Brown told Officer Eric Harrison (White male) (hereinafter “Officer Harrison”) \nto work with another officer, Officer Harrison responded by shouting “he can suck my dick.” \nPlaintiff Brinkley immediately looked up to the Sgts. in attendance, and heard several members \nlaughing.   \n312.  But neither Sgt. Miller nor Sgt. Brown addressed the foul and inappropriate comment. \n53 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 54 of 208\n \n313.  This was the one of the straws that broke the camel’s back for Plaintiff Brinkley.  She got \nup from the meeting and walked out, rather than confront again the unprofessionalism and \nobscenity of her co-worker.  \n314.  Plaintiff Brinkley spoke to Sgt. Brown after the meeting, who admitted that the comment \nwas inappropriate, but who refused to do anything to stop such comments and re-establish and \nenforce the professionalism standards of the department.  \n315.  Plaintiff Brinkley later texted Lt. Robinson to complain about the offensive language \nbecause she felt the complaint would not be handled by Sgts. Miller and Brown.  \n316.  Lt. Robinson replied “until further notice he will show his presence in roll call, etc.”  \nHowever, he did not follow through with his assurances to Plaintiff Brinkley, and did not attend \nroll thereafter. \n317.  Having received no action from Lt. Robinson to rectify a work environment that had \ndevolved into “lock-room talk” central, and that constantly made her, the only female in the room, \nuncomfortable, Plaintiff Brinkley went to the MPD EEO office to complain.  \n318.  On or about February 5, 2020, Plaintiff Brinkley was advised by Lt. Robinson to make a \ncomplaint to MPD EEO Mr. Lee, in which she was contacted to by EEO officer Doreen Haines \n(Black woman) (hereinafter “Ms. Haines”) about Officer Harrison’s comment, and the fact that \nSgt. Brown had permitted the comment to go without any action or redress.  \n319.  She further complained that Sgt. Brown was permitting her workplace to become a hyper-\nsexualized and obscenity-laden workplace.  \n320.  During her interview with MPD EEO office, the Plaintiff Brinkley did not believe that EEO \ninvestigator Ms. Ranae Lee (hereinafter “Ms. Lee”) had offered advice and guidance to Plaintiff \nor taken her concerns seriously.   \n54 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 55 of 208\n \n321.  All the EEO interviews were recorded.  \n322.  On information and belief, Ms. Lee played the recording for Mr. Alphonso Lee, her \nsupervisor in the EEO department.  Mr. Lee disciplined Ms. Lee for being “too helpful” to Plaintiff \nBrinkley, and for giving any credence to Plaintiff Brinkley’s complaint.  \n323.  On information and belief, Mr. Lee leaked to Sgt. Boyd that Plaintiff Brinkley had \ncomplained about him and the toxic work-environment he was fostering. \n324.  From that point on, Plaintiff Brinkley became the target of a concerted, intentional and \nsystematic and retaliatory campaign to drum her out of the MPD. \n325.  According to EEO Counselor Harry Carter (Black male) (hereinafter “Mr. Carter”), who \nworked directly for Mr. Lee and was privy to Mr. Lee’s comments about Plaintiff Brinkley, Mr. \nLee told Ms. Doreen Haines and Ms. Ranae Lee before an investigation had been conducted \nregarding Plaintiff Brinkley’s complaint, as well as complaints from several other Black female \nofficers, that “MPD would be better off if they figured out how to fire officers like [Plaintiff], \nOfficer Karen Carr (Black female), and Officer Tabatha Knight (Black female) because all they \ndid was file complaints.” \n326.  In short, EEO Director Lee decided that the MPD would benefit from moving out Plaintiff \nand some of the other Black female officers with similar complaints and initiated a campaign in \nMPD to achieve that goal.  \n327.  Plaintiff Brinkley became alarmed at the retaliation and discrimination that was taking \nplace at the MPD and wrote to Mayor Muriel Bowser to report what was going on.   \n328.  Plaintiff Brinkley received a response from the Mayoral office on or about March 26, 2020. \n329.  On or about March 25, 2020, there was a scheduled meeting with Lt. Robinson, Sgt.  \nBrown, Plaintiff Brinkley’s partner SPO Mitchell and Plaintiff Brinkley.  \n55 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 56 of 208\n \n330.  When Plaintiff Brinkley asked about the status of her complaint, Lt. Robinson became \nhostile, dismissing her concerns and simply stating that such investigations “take time.” \n331.  Even more troubling to Plaintiff Brinkley, towards the end of the meeting, Lt. Robinson \nindicated that he would be separating Plaintiff Brinkley and her long-time partner SPO Mitchell, \nbecause there were “red flags,” with regards to them and that “they were being watched” and seen \ntransferring bags from one car to another.   \n332.  Lt. Robinson further stated that Plaintiff Brinkley and SPO Mitchell needed to “watch the \ncompany they kept.”  \n333.  Plaintiff Brinkley interpreted these statements as both a warning and a threat, and as thinly \nveiled retaliation for her reporting her concerns of discrimination and retaliation to the Mayor’s \nOffice.   \n334.  Lt. Robinson was telegraphing to her that her concerns were unimportant, and also that in \nraising her concerns, she was becoming the subject of scrutiny and a target for retaliation. \n335.  Lt. Robinson decision to separate Plaintiff Brinkley from her long-time partner was, and \nwas meant to be, punitive.   \n336.  Both Plaintiff Brinkley and SPO Mitchell felt the move to separate them was punitive in \nnature, and very destabilizing and unsettling to their work life.  \n337.  Worse still, around the time of the meeting, Lt. Robinson chose to discipline Plaintiff \nBrinkley for arriving at work too early, something that in all her years in the MPD, Plaintiff had \nnever seen another officer disciplined for.  \n338.  On or about April 9, 2020, Plaintiff Brinkley went on sick leave due to exposure to the \ncoronavirus because she had been around SPO Mitchell, who had tested positive for the virus.  \nPlaintiff went on leave per Center for Disease Control (hereinafter “CDC”) protocols.   \n56 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 57 of 208\n \n339.  However, when she was tested, she came up negative, so she returned to work prior to \ncompleting the full 14-day quarantine period.  \n340.  On or about April 21, 2020, Plaintiff Brinkley elected to file an OHR complaint, alleging \ndiscrimination and retaliation and seeking redress for her concerns about the treatment of Black \nWomen Officers in the MPD. \n341.  According to CDC guidelines, the entrance and exit of the SOD building was limited to \none door, so that persons entering could have their temperatures taken, and answer health questions \nto assess their risk. \n342.  From June 5, 2020, to June 12, 2020, the officials of SOD ERT failed to post someone at \nthe door to conduct the health assessments.  So, when Plaintiff arrived at work, she looked around, \nand then entered the building.  Obviously, several other officers did the same thing.  \n343.  On or about June 9, 2020, Plaintiff Brinkley notified Sgt. Brown about the fact that there \nwas no one conducting health screening assessments at the SOD entrance, to which Sgt. Brown \nunhelpfully responded that he was “drawing a blank.”  \n344.  Plaintiff Brinkley raised the issue because she had already been exposed to COVID-19 at \nwork and lived through the anxiety of waiting for a test result, which exacerbated her anxiety \ncondition. She had no desire to repeat the experience.  \n345.  On June 16, 2020, Plaintiff Brinkley reasserted her concerns about the fact that the CDC-\nmandated health assessments were not being conducted because there was no one stationed at the \nentrance to do them.  She spoke with Sgt. Brown, who told her to speak to Lt. Robinson. \n346.  The same day, Plaintiff Brinkley reached out to Lt. Robinson, who answered her concern \nwith a one-word response: “noted.” \n57 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 58 of 208\n \n347.  Subsequently  Lt.  Robinson  sent  Plaintiff  Brinkley  an  email  about  her  duties  for  an \nupcoming detail, but made no mention of the mandatory health assessment, or her legitimate \nconcerns regarding the fact that they were not being conducted.  \n348.  On June 17, 2020, Sgt. Miller raised to SPO Mitchell that “someone complained” about \nthe health assessments not being done, thus letting SPO Mitchell know that the leadership was \nannoyed with Plaintiff Brinkley’s persistent complaints about the issue.   \n349.  When Plaintiff Brinkley arrived at work that day, a tactical officer on limited duty stationed \nat the door took her temperature but did not ask the health assessment questions.  \n350.  On June 19, 2020, when Plaintiff Brinkley reported for duty, again there was no one at the \nSOD entrance to conduct the assessment.  Plaintiff Brinkley entered the building and went to the \nnegotiator’s office, where Sgt. Brown, took her temperature.  \n351.  Again, Sgt. Brown, and the rest of the leadership team failed to take Plaintiff Brinkley’s \nconcerns seriously and made her feel like a pariah for raising the issue. This compounded her stress \nand anxiety about entering a workplace that was clearly not abiding by CDC-guidelines.     \n352.  On or about July 10, 2020, Plaintiff Brinkley was shocked to receive an email from Captain \nMichelle  Caron  (White  female)  (hereinafter  “Capt.  Caron”),  that  was  curt  and  aggressive, \ndemanding that Plaintiff provide an explanation as to why she had not submitted a written \nstatement regarding an incident she had witnessed between Sgt. Boyd and Officer Carr.  \n353.  In fact, Plaintiff Brinkley was not evading Captain Caron’s request, but was simply on \nleave during the time of her request.   \n354.  Had Captain Caron inquired, the Captain would have discovered that Plaintiff Brinkley \nwas not being evasive.   \n58 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 59 of 208\n \n355.  Again, this incident was part of a pattern in which Plaintiff Brinkley was treated with \nsuspicion and disregard.  \n356.  Three days after receiving Captain Caron’s accusatory email, Plaintiff Brinkley was called \nin to IAD to answer to a charge that she had missed a health assessment in roll call.   \n357.  This was precisely the issue that Plaintiff Brinkley not only raised to her leadership, but \nwas persistently ignored about.  When she pointed out that there was no one stationed at the \ndesignated entrance, IAD informed Plaintiff Brinkley that she should have “gone in and looked” \nfor an official.   \n358.  Plaintiff Brinkley responded that there was no one to find on that particular date.  \n359.  This episode of intimidation and retaliation was particularly stunning to Plaintiff Brinkley, \nbecause of her efforts to address the issue of health assessments at the entrances, and was ignored \nby her chain of command.   \n360.  But rather than simply dismissing the claim, IAD kept the case open and refused to clear \nPlaintiff Brinkley of the allegation. \n361.  As mentioned above, MPD EEO and IAD were blithely leaking and sharing information \nfrom confidential interviews with rank-and-file officers, which spread like wildfire through the \ndepartment. This was a concerted effort by EEO Director Lee and others to sow distrust and anger \nin the department, and to isolate and intimidate Plaintiff Brinkley. \n362.  Thus, at the roll call that took place on or about July 17, 2020, Officer Anthony Campanale \n(White male) (hereinafter “Officer Campanale”) shouted at Plaintiff Brinkley asking if she was \nrecording the roll call.  Plaintiff Brinkley took immediate offense at his volatile and physically \naggressive stance and tone, and asked Officer Campanale “who are you talking to?”   \n59 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 60 of 208\n \n363.  Officer Campanale continued to aggressively question and move into Plaintiff Brinkley’s \npersonal space and had to be restrained by other officers in the room.   \n364.  Officer Campanale was so aggressive, that he made Plaintiff Brinkley fear for her personal \nsafety.   \n365.  Sgt. Luke Foskett (hereinafter “Sgt. Foskett”) was conducting the roll call.   \n366.  When Plaintiff Brinkley asked him if he was going to do anything about Officer Campanale \naggressively charging her, Sgt. Foskett asked Plaintiff Brinkley: “well are you recording?”  \n367.  The Sgt.’s response was so offensive, and so inappropriate, that Plaintiff Brinkley simply \nwalked out of the roll call, shaking with anger and anxiety. \n368.  Plaintiff Brinkley immediately notified her Union Steward Hiram Rosario (hereinafter \n“Union Steward Rosario”) and Officer Knight, who notified the chain of command.  \n369.  On or about July 22, 2020, Plaintiff Brinkley met with EEO Director Lee and complained \nabout the retaliation from members of the SOD unit.   \n370.  Mr. Lee informed Plaintiff Brinkley that she could file an EEOC charge, which was his \nway of communicating that his department would not be investigating her claims. \n371.  As part of his ongoing campaign of petty attacks, on or about August 14, 2020, Sgt. Boyd \nordered Plaintiff to put her cell phone away at roll call, even though he kept both of his cell phones \nvisible on the table in front of him, and he allowed other male tactical officers to keep their cell \nphones out and visible.   \n372.  Plaintiff Brinkley could not help but feel embarrassed and singled out as the only female \nofficer in the roll call, targeted for blatantly disparate application of the rules.  \n373.  On or about August 16, 2020, Plaintiff Brinkley was off work when the ERT unit issued a \npolicy change requiring officers to wear their ballistic vests at roll call.   \n60 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 61 of 208\n \n374.  Because Plaintiff Brinkley was off that day, she was not informed of the policy change, but \nall the other tactical officers were aware of the change. \n375.  On or about August 18, 2020, on Plaintiff Brinkley’s first shift after her day off, Sgt. Boyd \npublicly embarrassed and singled out Plaintiff in the roll call meeting for not wearing her protective \nvest, even though he knew she was off when the policy change occurred, and that he, as her \nsupervisor, failed to give her a heads’ up about the new rule.   \n376.  Sgt. Brown used this innocuous and unintentional oversight as a basis to further humiliate \nPlaintiff Brinkley, and belittle her in front of her colleagues.  \n377.  On or about August 27, 2020, Plaintiff Brinkley was summoned to IAD again, to receive a \ndisciplinary charge related to the incident with Officer Campanale.   \n378.  Although Officer Campanale physically charged and threatened Plaintiff Brinkley, and had \nto be physically restrained from harming her, the Department decided to punish Plaintiff Brinkley \nfor “raising her tone,” which they deemed inappropriate.  \n379.  Plaintiff Brinkley was charged with conduct unbecoming an officer, and no discipline, at \nthat time, was given to Officer Campanale. \n380.  On or about September 1, 2020, Plaintiff Brinkley was disciplined for missing a call out \non a barricade.  Not only was she the first officer in the history of ERT to be disciplined for that, \nbut to add insult to injury, the Department went back in time to add the call-out she missed on \nMother’s Day in May.   \n381.  In other words, the Department leadership manufactured something to discipline Plaintiff \nBrinkley for, and then went looking for a way to increase the severity of the punishment.  \n61 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 62 of 208\n \n382.  On September 8, 2020, Capt. Caron asked Plaintiff Brinkley to write yet another statement \nregarding the incident involving Sgt. Boyd’s disrespectful and rude behavior towards Officer Carr, \nwho is also an African American female officer.   \n383.  Capt. Caron asked specific questions in her request to Plaintiff Brinkley designed to entrap \nPlaintiff Brinkley into making contradictory statements.   \n384.  Plaintiff Brinkley, however, did not modify her original statement.  \n385.  On or about September 10, 2020, Plaintiff Brinkley entered the SOD building to begin her \nshift, but found no one stationed there to take temperatures and conduct health assessments. Again, \nthis was a management failure and oversight that was used as an excuse to discipline Plaintiff \nBrinkley a few months prior, despite the fact that she had no authority to ensure that MPD adhered \nto CDC guidelines. \n386.  The lack of consistent manning of the SOD entrance with someone to conduct health \nassessments  and  take  temperatures  is  evidence  that  the  Department  was  not  serious  about \nprotecting the health of its officers (which explains why Plaintiff Brinkley was twice exposed to \nCOVID-19  from  her  co-workers)  but  was  instead  only  serious  about  manufacturing  phony \nviolations for which to discipline Plaintiff.  \n387.  On October 29, 2020, Plaintiff was given an assignment by Sgt. Boyd.  All the other \npersonnel with a similar assignment were relieved, but Plaintiff was not.  Plaintiff Brinkley had to \ncall in to remind Sgt. Brown that she needed to be relieved.   \n388.  Again, Plaintiff Brinkley had to work longer than her colleagues, and had to ask for the \ncourtesy and concern that was automatically given to her male counterparts.  \n389.  On October 31, 2020, Plaintiff sent an email to Chief of Police Peter Newsham (White \nmale)  (hereinafter  “Chief  Newsham”)  and  Assistant  Chief  Jeffery  Carroll  (White  male) \n62 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 63 of 208\n \n(hereinafter “Asst. Chief Carroll”) and others in the chain of command to complain and inform of \nthe systemic and sustained disparate treatment and discriminatory actions against Black female \nofficers in the MPD. \n390.  On or about November 3, 2020, Sgt. Brown allowed tactical members to come in before \ntheir scheduled duty and gave them assignments without disciplining them.  This stands in sharp \ncontrast to the discipline Plaintiff Brinkley received for coming in early for one single shift, and is \nfurther evidence of disparate treatment.  \n391.  Sgt. Brown did not conduct a roll call that day, nor a health assessment, but he did give \nPlaintiff Brinkley an assignment for ballot box detail, which she executed.  Plaintiff was shocked \nto be later written up for not attending the roll call or health assessment, that Sgt. Brown failed to \nhold or provide.   \n392.  This disciplinary write up was yet another example of breathtakingly unfair discipline, \nbased on pretext and false evidence, was designed to demoralize and break down Plaintiff \nBrinkley’s will.  \n393.  On  or  about  November  10,  2020,  Plaintiff  Brinkley  received  her  job  performance \ndocumentation.  In it she found several supposed “violations” that were basically trumped-up, \nfabricated, unjust, disparate or exaggerated charges, that formulated a basis for the Department to \nterminate her employment. \n394.  On or about November 24, 2020, Plaintiff Brinkley was exposed a second time to COVID-\n19, this time from one of the tactical officers who had tested positive, and therefore went back into \nquarantine until her test results were returned.   \n63 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 64 of 208\n \n395.  That day, Plaintiff Brinkley received a telephone call from her union representative Officer \nRosario advising her that IAD was moving forward with the “conduct unbecoming” charge against \nher for the incident with Officer Campanale.   \n396.  When Plaintiff Brinkley returned to work, she was told to report to IAD to sign paperwork \nrelated to the discipline over the Officer Campanale incident. Plaintiff strongly disagreed with the \ndisciplinary finding but signed the document anyway, noting on the document that she was signing \nunder duress, in order to be left alone. \n397.  In the normal course of business, Plaintiff Brinkley would have received her performance \nevaluation, and any notice of deficiencies, in order for her to have an opportunity to improve on \nthose deficiencies.   \n398.  However, in her case, Plaintiff Brinkley had to ask Sgt. Brown for her performance \nevaluation, and she was never given a list of deficiencies, or time to fix them.  Instead, she was \ngiven a very low performance evaluation based almost entirely on minor disciplinary matters that \nwere either fabricated, disproportionate, disparate or unfair.  \n399.  Plaintiff  Brinkley,  therefore  asked  for  a  meeting  to  discuss  her  concerns  about  her \nperformance evaluation and to explore how she could engage with management about her concerns \nwith the way she was being treated. \n400.  During Plaintiff Brinkley’s shift on or about December 8, 2020, while Plaintiff was talking \non the phone with her union representative, Sgt. Brown approached Plaintiff Brinkley to direct her \nto go to the roll call room for the performance evaluation meeting she had asked for.   \n401.  Rather than allowing Plaintiff Brinkley to finish her call, Sgt. Brown rudely and loudly \ninterrupted her, and gave her the directive about the meeting in a condescending, hostile and \ndisrespectful manner.  \n64 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 65 of 208\n \n402.  Plaintiff Brinkley had asked her union representative to hold while she spoke with Sgt. \nBrown, but because Sgt. Brown was speaking so loudly and aggressively, Officer Knight, the \nrepresentative, was able to hear the entire exchange.   \n403.  Officer Knight took note and was dismayed at the disrespectful and hostile tone that Sgt. \nBrown used to convey a simple directive.  \n404.  Plaintiff  Brinkley  went  to  the  meeting  as  directed  but  asked  for,  and  received, \nrepresentation from her union representative Officer Knight at the meeting.  \n405.  Once Plaintiff Brinkley arrived at the performance evaluation meeting, she found Sgt. \nBrown and one other Sgt. from a different department, whom Plaintiff did not know or recognize.   \n406.  Officer Knight, in her role as union representative, insisted that the performance evaluation \nmeeting only be attended by SOD managers.  Thus, the non-SOD Sgt. who was initially there, left \nthe  meeting  and  was  replaced  Sgt.  Jane  Barrientos  (Hispanic  female)  (hereinafter  “Sgt. \nBarrientos”).  \n407.  At  the  meeting,  Officer  Knight  questioned  and  challenged  Sgt.  Brown  about  the \ndisciplinary  matters  in  the  evaluation,  but  Sgt.  Brown  refused  to  make  any  substantial  or \nmeaningful changes to the evaluation.  Plaintiff Brinkley then formally appealed the content of her \nperformance evaluation.  \n408.  On or about December 9, 2020, while on shift, Plaintiff Brinkley started experiencing \nanxiety and migraine headache symptoms related to the stress of what had happened in her \nperformance evaluation meeting.   \n409.  She notified Sgt. Miller of her worsening condition and asked to go to the Police and Fire \nclinic for assistance.  \n65 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 66 of 208\n \n410.  On or about December 23, 2020, Plaintiff Brinkley filed a formal charge with the EEOC, \nalleging race, age, gender and disability discrimination, and retaliation, and disparate treatment.  \n411.  After seeing the clinic’s psychologist and speaking with the clinic’s Physician Assistant \nTasha Williams, Plaintiff Brinkley was placed on sick leave to mitigate her anxiety symptoms, \nuntil December 31, 2020.  \n412.  While on sick leave, Plaintiff was notified on or about December 12, 2020, that Sgt. Brown \nhad tested positive for COVID-19, and that she would have to be tested again for having been \nexposed for the third time, to a co-worker who had tested positive.     \n413.  Plaintiff reported to the Police and Fire Clinic for testing, and luckily tested negative.  \nHowever, the inconvenience and anxiety related to this third potential exposure, in conjunction \nwith the fact that her concerns and inquiries about non-compliance with coronavirus protocols by \nSOD management went unaddressed, caused Plaintiff to experience even more frustration with her \nsituation.  \n414.  Despite her union representative’s efforts to address the inaccurate and unfair disciplinary \nactions in Plaintiff’s evaluation, SOD management was unwilling to modify the assessment. \nTherefore, on or about January 9, 2021, Plaintiff wrote to MPD Assistant Chief Carroll and several \ncity council members regarding the disparate treatment, racial inequality, retaliatory behavior, \nharassment and criminal actions of the IAD.   \n415.  The Assistant Chief replied on January 11, 2021, denying that any discriminatory practices \nexisted in SOD, and referred Plaintiff back to EEO for investigations of her concerns.  His response \nwas a slap in the face to Plaintiff, inasmuch as she had complained of the fact that EEO was \nsystematically ignoring and dismissing claims from Black female officers.  \n66 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 67 of 208\n \n416.  On or about January 11, 2021, Plaintiff Brinkley received denial of her performance \nevaluation appeal from Master Patrol Officer Kevin Brittingham (White male) (hereinafter “MPO \nBrittingham”). \n417.  On or about February 17, 2021, Lt. Robinson ordered Plaintiff Brinkley to attend a mental \nevaluation and assessment, as a final step to proving that the allegations and claims against Plaintiff \nthat  resulted  in  a  pattern  of  disciplinary  actions,  was  justified.    This  directive  was  also \ndiscriminatory and disparate based on her disability. \n418.  On or about February 19, 2021, Plaintiff Brinkley wrote to the District of Columbia City \nCouncil to complain about the discrimination and retaliation she was being subjected to, and to \ninform them of the systemic discrimination and lack of EEO support in the MPD. \n419.  On or about March 1, 2021, in furtherance of the campaign to harass Plaintiff Brinkley, \nCaptain Caron told her subordinates to direct Plaintiff Brinkley to respond to another request for a \nstatement related to a barricade that took place on or about February 23, 2021, and to answer \nspecific questions by the end of Plaintiffs’ shift.   \n420.  This request put Plaintiff Brinkley on notice that the Department was looking for yet \nanother reason to discharge her.  \n421.  On or about March 2, 2021, Union Steward Rosario replied to Captain Caron’s request via \nemail, stating that the request violated Article 13 of the Labor Agreement. \n422.  On or about March 8, 2021, the Plaintiff Brinkley received her Notice of Right to Sue letter \nfrom the EEOC.  \n423.  On or about March 23, 2021, Plaintiff Brinkley attended a virtual meeting to dispute the \ndecision of the clinic that Plaintiff Brinkley’s anxiety and stress was “not work-related.”   \n67 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 68 of 208\n \n424.  This was an entirely self-serving conclusion, designed to protect and give cover to the SOD \npersonnel who were engaged in an active and coordinated campaign against Plaintiff Brinkley.  \n425.  Again, Plaintiff Brinkley was the victim of coordinated retaliation which had the exact \neffect and outcome its perpetrators desired.  \n426.  On or about April 13, 2021, a grievance meeting was conducted to hear Plaintiff Brinkley’s \ngrievance related to her performance evaluation.   \n427.  Plaintiff Brinkley attended the meeting with MPO Brittingham, who was serving as her \nrepresentative.   \n428.  The grievance hearing panel consisted of Union Steward Rosario, Captain Sean Conboy \nand Sergeant Shavaun Ross.  The panel concluded and said they would get back to Plaintiff \nBrinkley within two weeks.  \n429.  On or about April 28, 2021, Sgt. Brown told Plaintiff Brinkley to report to Human Resource \nthe following day.  \n430.  When Plaintiff Brinkley asked Sgt. Brown why she needed to do so, he stated that he did \nnot know the reason for the meeting. \n431.  On or about April 29, 2021, Plaintiff Brinkley reported to Human Resources as directed, \nalong with her Union Steward Rosario.  \n432.  At that time, Plaintiff Brinkley was terminated from her employment, effective April 30, \n2021. \n          Plaintiff Brinkley’s Individual Causes of Action \n  Race Discrimination and Retaliation Claims \n433.  Plaintiff incorporates and restates all of the previous factual allegations contained in this \nComplaint as if fully restated herein. \n68 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 69 of 208\n \n434.  Plaintiff Brinkley, on her own behalf, asserts herein claims pursuant to Title VII of the \nCivil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e, et seq.;  the District of Columbia Human \nRights Act, District of Columbia Code § 2-1401.01 et seq., and the Civil Rights Act of 1866 \nDiscrimination Based on Race in the Making and Enforcing of Contracts 42 U.S.C. §1981(a) by \nway of, through and via 42 U.S.C. § 1983. \n435.  Plaintiff was treated disparately, subjected to a hostile work environment and retaliated \nagainst for complaining about and opposing the race discrimination to which she was subjected.  \n436.  The facts alleged above, if proven, constitute discrimination, and systematic retaliation \nsevere and pervasive enough to be compensable. \n437.  The facts alleged above, taken in conjunction with the facts alleged by the other nine (9) \nCRPs, establish that Defendant maintained a pattern, practice and custom of race discrimination \nagainst Black women police officers on the basis of race.  \n438.  The facts alleged by Plaintiff Brinkley that establish that she was treated disparately than \nher non-Black-female colleagues, are typical of, and consistent with, the claims of the other nine \n(9) CRPs. \n439.

Plaintiff was treated disparately, subjected to a hostile work environment and retaliated \nagainst for complaining about and opposing the gender discrimination she was subjected to.  \n445.  The facts alleged above, if proven, constitute discrimination, and systematic retaliation \nsevere and pervasive enough to be compensable. \n446.  The facts alleged above, taken in conjunction with the facts alleged by the other nine (9) \nCRPs, establish that Defendant maintained a pattern and practice of race discrimination against \nBlack women police officers on the basis of sex.  \n447.

Pursuant to the District of Columbia Whistleblower Protection Act D.C. Code § 1-615-51 \net seq., Defendants are prohibited from reassigning, terminating or otherwise retaliating against a \nD.C. government employee as a result of that employee’s protected disclosures that the employee \nreasonably believes show gross mismanagement, gross misuse or waste of government resources, \nand abuse of authority in the connection with the administration of a government program, or a \nviolation of a state, local or federal law, rule or regulation.  \n453.

As a direct result of Plaintiff Brinkley’s protected disclosures, Defendants systematically \nand continuously retaliated against Plaintiff, including but not limited to unwarranted disciplinary \nactions against Plaintiff, isolation and separation from coworkers, unfavorable treatment and \nassignments, false and inaccurate performance evaluation and ultimately termination. \n71 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 72 of 208\n \n455.  As a result of Defendants’ actions, Plaintiff Brinkley suffered significant economic harm \nin the form of loss of employment, corresponding salary, loss of employment opportunities, \ndamage to her professional reputation, and significant mental and emotional distress. \n456.  Plaintiff Brinkley was humiliated, embarrassed and made to endure constant stress and \nanxiety, depression, lack of sleep and other symptoms that required her to seek professional \ntreatment, and that materially caused her severe mental anguish. \n457.  Plaintiff Brinkley has incurred lost wages, loss of reputation and loss of career opportunity \nnow and into the future, and all the other losses stated herein. \n458.  Plaintiff herein seeks compensatory damages, and damages for mental pain and suffering \nof not less than $250,000.00, plus interest, costs, fees and all other remedies the Court deems \nappropriate. \n        Age Discrimination and Retaliation Claim \n459.  Plaintiff Brinkley incorporates and restates all information and allegations contained in the \npreceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n460.  Plaintiff Brinkley asserts that she was discriminated against and retaliated against, in part, \nbecause of her age (over 40), in violation of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act 29 U.S.C. \n§§ 621-634. \n461.  At least in part, because of her age, Plaintiff Brinkley, a Senior Police Officer was denied \nsick leave, weekend days off, duty assignments, training, and health assessments, while these same \nopportunities and benefits were given to much younger police officers. \n462.  At least in part, Plaintiff Brinkley was terminated from her employment because of her age, \nand the reasons given for her termination were false and pretextual to hide a discriminatory intent.  \n72 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 73 of 208\n \n463.  MPD’s termination of Plaintiff Brinkley was motivated, at least in part, to retaliate against  \nher for opposing age discrimination at MPD.  \n464.  Plaintiff Brinkley was humiliated, embarrassed and made to endure constant stress and \nanxiety, depression, lack of sleep and other symptoms that materially caused her severe mental \nanguish.  \n465.  Plaintiff Brinkley has incurred lost wages, loss of reputation and loss of career opportunity \nnow and into the future, and all the other losses stated herein. \n466.  Plaintiff Brinkley herein seeks compensatory damages, and damages for mental pain and \nsuffering of not less than $500,000.00 plus interest, costs, fees and all other remedies the Court \ndeems appropriate. \n     Disability Discrimination and Retaliation Claim \n467.  Plaintiff Brinkley incorporates and restates all information and allegations contained in the \npreceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n468.  Plaintiff Brinkley asserts herein that MPD violated her rights under the Americans with \nDisabilities Act of 1990, 42 U.S.C. 126, § 12101 et seq. \n469.  After the death of her husband, Plaintiff suffered from depression and an anxiety condition \nfor which she was under the care of medical professionals, and which was known to the Defendant, \nand as such, is a member of a protected class. \n470.  The Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq., prohibits employers from \ndiscriminating against qualified individuals because of a disability “in regard to job application \nprocedures, the hiring, advancement or discharge of employees, employment compensation, job \ntraining, and other terms, conditions, and privileges of employment.” 42 U.S.C. § 12112. \n73 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 74 of 208\n \n471.  Plaintiff’s disability substantially limited at least one of Plaintiff’s major life activities, \nsleeping.  Plaintiff is an individual with a disability under the ADA. \n472.  On  several  occasions,  as  described  above,  Defendant  asked  Plaintiff  inappropriate \nquestions about her disability, and commented about her disability to her colleagues and co-\nworkers.  \n473.  On one occasion, as a result of having an episode related to depression and anxiety, \nPlaintiff’s supervisor made negative comments about her to her colleagues and threatened to send \nher for a fitness for duty evaluation, which was intended to be, and was a threat to her future \nemployment and a reprisal for her suffering from a disability.  \n474.  When  Plaintiff  complained  about  her  serious  and  legitimate  concerns  regarding  her \nDepartment’s failure to comply with CDC guidelines regarding personnel entering the SOD \nbuilding, she was ignored or humiliated for raising the issue.  Later, management disciplined her \nfor not obtaining a health assessment upon entering the building, when it was her management that \nfailed to station a person at the entrance to conduct the assessment. \n475.  Defendant’s actions were intended to mock Plaintiff for suffering from anxiety, and to add \nto exasperate her condition by forcing her to be even more worried for her health due to potential \nexposure to COVID-19. \n476.  On  three  occasions,  as  described  above,  Plaintiff  was  exposed  to  COVID-19  from \ncolleagues who had tested positive and was forced to quarantine as a result.  Each such instance \nwas the result of Defendant’s lackadaisical attitude to compliance with CDC COVID-19 protocols. \n477.  On at least two occasions, personal and confidential information about Plaintiff’s mental \nhealth condition and disability was discussed or leaked to her colleagues by her supervisors, \n74 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 75 of 208\n \ncausing Plaintiff’s co-workers to not want to work with her, and shaming Plaintiff and creating a \nstigma related to her disability. \n478.  Defendant’s actions constituted disparate and discriminatory treatment that caused Plaintiff \nto suffer and punished her for having a disability. \n479.  Plaintiff was humiliated, embarrassed and made to endure constant stress and anxiety, \ndepression, lack of sleep and other symptoms that required her to seek professional treatment, and \nthat materially caused her severe mental anguish.   \n480.  Plaintiff has incurred lost wages, loss of reputation and loss of career opportunity now and \ninto the future, and all the other losses stated herein. \n481.  Plaintiff herein seeks compensatory damages, and damages for mental pain and suffering \nof not less than $500,000, plus interest, costs, fees and all other remedies the Court deems \nappropriate. \n                     PLAINTIFF BROWN’S INDIVIDUAL CLAIMS \n      Facts Relevant to Plaintiff Brown’s Individual Claims \n482.  Plaintiff Brown began her employment with the MPD in 2015. \n483.  Plaintiff was mountain-bike certified, a process that took substantial effort and excellent \nphysical fitness. Cdr. Taylor, therefore asked her to maximize her time patrolling her turf by \nbicycle, which allowed Plaintiff to have close proximity to the community. \n484.  During the first year of her employment, she was appointed the Community Patrol Officer \nin a neighborhood known as Fairfax Village.  \n485.  This beat was historically given to an officer with years of experience, and was viewed by \nmany officers as a desirable assignment.  \n75 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 76 of 208\n \n486.  The Fairfax Village community had specifically asked the Departmental Commander \nDavid Taylor (hereinafter “Cdr. Taylor”), that Plaintiff Brown be assigned to that beat.   \n487.  Plaintiff’s schedule for the Fairfax Village beat was somewhat unusual, in that it split shifts.  \nShe came in after day shift roll call, and worked into the evening on night shift.  She was therefore \nsupervised by Sergeants on two different shifts. \n488.  From approximately 2015 to early 2019, the Departmental Lieutenant was Jonathan Munk \n(hereinafter “Lt. Munk”), who reported to directly to Cdr. Taylor because all of the Departmental \nCaptains remained in a different section.  \n489.  Several of Plaintiff’s fellow officers, and the day shift Sergeants Robert Drummond \n(hereinafter “Sgt. Drummond”) and Sergeant James Weathersby (hereinafter “Sgt. Weathersby”) \nresented that Plaintiff Brown was given such a desirable assignment, and responded by harassing, \ndenigrating, undermining and bullying her on the job. \n490.  Most  importantly,  Plaintiff’s  direct  supervisors  constantly  tried  to  impede  her  from \npatrolling the community by bike, and assigned her to patrol by car, informing Plaintiff that she \nneeded to “earn the right” to patrol Fairfax Village by bicycle.  \n491.  There was no MPD policy requiring that an officer has to “earn the right” to any beat or \npatrol area, and Plaintiff Brown’s supervisors had no basis to make such a demand of her.  \n492.  When Plaintiff Brown reminded her Sergeants Drummond and Weathersby that she had \nqualified to patrol by bicycle, and was personally requested by the Fairfax Village community, \nthey would tell Plaintiff that she was subject to their power and would have to do what they wanted.  \n493.  There was no legitimate reason or justification for the way Plaintiff’s supervisors treated \nher. \n76 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 77 of 208\n \n494.  When Plaintiff brought her concerns about being bullied and denied the benefit of a \npositive assignment to the attention of Lt. Munk, the Lieutenant attempted to intercede.  But he \nwas not always there, and he had little power in the department. \n495.  As soon as the coast was clear, Plaintiff’s supervising Sergeants retaliated against her for \ngoing up the chain of command by escalating the harassment and bullying.  \n496.  On one occasion in 2018, Sgt. Michael Grey (hereinafter “Sgt. Grey”), another Sergeant \non day shift, took Plaintiff’s radio, an essential piece of equipment and hid it for an entire shift, \nand told her that she should not have left it unattended and unsecured in the police station.  \n497.  This was an uncalled-for act of demeaning bullying of Plaintiff because the station was a \nsecured location which was attended by the station clerk, who watched over all of the radios that \nwere placed on the radio charger.  \n498.  All of the Department’s officers left their radios in that location to be charged. \n499.  Sgt. Grey did not take anyone’s radio except Plaintiff’s.  Even radios that were left for \nseveral days because the officers were scheduled off were left untouched.  \n500.  Plaintiff was also targeted by her fellow officers for bullying through small acts of micro-\naggressions such as repeatedly taking her lunch.  She was the only officer on either shift who was \ntreated that way. \n501.  Plaintiff’s supervising Sergeants were aware that she was being bullied by her fellow \nofficers, and instead of preventing it, they actually permitted and encouraged such unprofessional \nbehavior.  \n502.  The lack of basic respect from her fellow officers made Plaintiff feel isolated and as if she \ncould not rely on their support and back-up. \n77 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 78 of 208\n \n503.  Plaintiff considered going to EEO to complain, but was intimidated out of doing it because \nshe had heard that  others who went to EEO were retaliated against. \n504.  As a relatively junior officer, Plaintiff did not feel she had the standing to challenge her \nsuperiors. \n505.  Plaintiff suffered small acts of disrespect and unprofessional bullying nearly every day, \nand was treated as a second-class citizen in her department because of her race and gender.  \n506.  While Plaintiff continued to suffer within the workplace, her relationship with community \ncontinued to get stronger because of her proactive approach to policing. \n507.  Every other weekend Plaintiff would buy pizza for the people who were regulars in her \npatrol area. She would buy cases of water for the homeless people and put water in a cooler and \npass it out on Fridays and Saturdays.  \n508.  Plaintiff would make care packages with socks, water, snacks and sanitary items in them \nand hand out to the homeless.  \n509.  Plaintiff often chose to do these positive things for the community while in uniform so that \npeople would develop a positive view of police officers.  \n510.  Plaintiff’s positive approach to policing  made her an outcast amongst several of her co-\nworkers, most especially white male officers.  \n511.  Many would tell her that she was wasting her time and was foolish for trying to help  people \nin the community.  \n512.  For years during her employment, Plaintiff’s fellow officers would write about her on a \nFacebook page called the MPD Forum.  \n513.  The other officers would say things like Plaintiff was a fake police officer, that she didn't \nwork, and that she was a “part-time” cop.  \n78 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 79 of 208\n \n514.  The campaign to cyber-bully Plaintiff began with white male police officers, and then was \njoined by Black male officers.   \n515.  Several MPD Sergeants and Lieutenants were on the forum and participated in the cyber-\nbullying aimed at Plaintiff because of her race and gender. \n516.  In 2019 Plaintiff Brown was selected as MPD Officer of the Year for the previous year, \ndue to her hard work in community service and improving community relations.   \n517.  Once she received the honor of Officer of the Year, the bullying from her fellow officers \nescalated. \n518.  Additionally, at that time, a change in leadership occurred.  Lt. Munk was replaced by Lt. \nHawkins. \n519.  Plaintiff was frequently denigrated and disrespected during roll call meetings, in full view \nof her departmental Sergeants. \n520.  Rather than insisting on a professional and respectful workplace, Plaintiff’s supervisors \nand managers fostered and encouraged a hostile, attacking, and bullying work environment. \n521.  At some point after Plaintiff was awarded the Officer Of The Year award, a significant \nbreak down of the chain of command occurred. \n522.  Plaintiff’s Departmental Commander at that time was Darriya Habbebulah (hereinafter \n“Cdr. Habbebulah”), a Black woman officer.  \n523.  Cdr. Habbebbulah made it clear to her subordinate Lieutenants and Sergeants that she \nwanted Plaintiff to spend as much time in the Fairfax Village community as possible, cruising in \nthe specially marked vehicle Plaintiff was awarded as Officer of the Year.  \n524.  Cdr. Habbebbulah  even had a bike rack placed on Plaintiff’s car so she could park the car \nand ride around the neighborhoods.  \n79 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 80 of 208\n \n525.  Not only was Cdr. Habbebbulah’s order disregarded, but there was no discipline or \nconsequences for the Sergeants and Lieutenants who defied it. \n526.  Eventually, Plaintiff Brown was involuntarily moved from the Fairfax Village beat without \nexplanation or justification.  \n527.  When Plaintiff was taken from the Fairfax Village beat, crime went up significantly.  \n528.  Despite being involuntarily reassigned, the daily and systematic bullying of Plaintiff did \nnot improve. \n529.  The situation deteriorated so much that the bullying bled over into the workplace, and \nPlaintiff felt she had to report it.  Plaintiff reached to Assistant Chief Chanel Dickerson, who \ninitiated an investigation into the forum.  \n530.  At the time, the forum was rife with comments of a racist and sexist nature, posted by \nofficers who were ostensibly supposed to serve the community in an unbiased manner. \n531.  IAD conducted the investigation of the forum, and it was ultimately shut down.  As far as \nPlaintiff is aware, no officers were disciplined for their comments or activities on the forum, \nincluding their bullying of Plaintiff.  \n532.  On or about [month/day], Plaintiff’s department received a complaint about her, but the \nname and email address of the complainant were fictitious.  \n533.  It was not lost on Plaintiff that shortly after the MPD Forum was investigated and shut \ndown, she became the subject of an investigation.  \n534.  The “anonymous” complaint against Plaintiff contained allegations that made it clear it \ncame from within the MPD, and was rife with unfounded accusations.   \n80 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 81 of 208\n \n535.  The gravamen of the complaint was that Plaintiff wasn’t making enough arrests and getting \nenough weapons off of the street. It was essentially denigrating Plaintiff for being too friendly and \nkind to the community. \n536.  Despite the obvious bias of the “anonymous” complaint, Plaintiff was nevertheless placed \nunder investigation.   \n537.  Plaintiff Brown was ultimately cleared of any wrongdoing, but had to endure the stress and \nuncertainty of being the subject of a frivolous and unjustified investigation. \n538.  Plaintiff had experienced the culture of intimidation when she attempted to report to Lt. \nPreston an incident that Plaintiff observed, of what she believed to be illegal stop and frisk activity. \n539.  The incident involved plain-clothes officers from another unit, who cruised into Plaintiff’s \nbeat area, came up to a group of young Black men, jumped out of the vehicle, lined the young men \nup against a gate, and started emptying their pockets, without any radio call or Be On The Lookout \n(hereinafter “BOLO”) notice related to an incident.  \n540.  Plaintiff believed that this incident was unlawful, and attempted to report it. \n541.  Lt. Preston listened to Plaintiff Brown’s recounting, and asked Plaintiff if she would write \na formal statement. \n542.  Then, Lt. Preston told Plaintiff that the officers involved were going to be told who reported \n(“snitched”) them, and then asked Plaintiff again, if she wanted to bother with a formal report. \n543.  Plaintiff interpreted that as a warning to keep silent, and therefore kept silent.  \n544.  Under MPD rules and polices, Lt. Preston herself had a duty to report the incident, and \nshould have escalated the matter, rather said something that encouraged Plaintiff not to pursue the \nmatter.  \n81 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 82 of 208\n \n545.  In addition to, and compounding the day-to-day stress that Plaintiff Brown felt from the \nconstant harassment and belittling she endured on the job, an incident occurred on or about \n[date], that deeply disturbed her.  \n546.  That day, an officer-involved shooting occurred in the 7th District.  \n547.  Plaintiff Brown was on duty and was deployed from the Police Academy to the 7th District \nPolice Station.  \n548.  The community was protesting in front of the building because an officer had shot and \nkilled a young African American male, and the crowd was agitated by a false rumor that the officer \nhad shot the young man in the back.  \n549.  When Plaintiff arrived on scene, the heated  and angry crowd was attempting to break into \nthe station.  \n550.  Plaintiff Brown and her fellow officers placed themselves around the building to make a \nprotective barricade, and held that post for hours.  \n551.  At approximately midnight, the size of the crowd had grown significantly,  but the push to \nbreach the building had completely stopped, and the perimeter was not being challenged.  \n552.  The crowd was still angry and upset, it was flashing lights in the faces of the officers, and  \nchanting BLM. Plaintiff Brown saw that many people were crying and extremely upset,  but none \nof the protesters were being physical or violent with the officers on the perimeter.  \n553.  At the same time, Plaintiff observed several white officers taunting the citizens and flashing \ntheir lights in their eyes and acting very unprofessional.  \n554.  Plaintiff observed white officers smacking their lips, laughing at the protesters and taunting \nthem.  \n82 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 83 of 208\n \n555.  One protester looked at Plaintiff and said \"Brown look, they are laughing at the fact that a \nblack boy is dead. They don't even care Brown, he looked just like you, his skin matched your \nskin, and they are laughing Brown,” or words to that effect. \n556.  Observing her  fellow officers treat  the  community with  the kind  of racial bias and \ndisrespect that they treated her, and other Black women police officers in the MPD, constituted \nthe final straw for her, and promoted Plaintiff Brown to resign from the MPD \n   Plaintiff Brown’s Individual Causes of Action \n  Race Discrimination and Retaliation Claims \n557.  Plaintiff Brown incorporates and restates all of the previous factual allegations contained \nin this Complaint as if fully restated herein. \n558.  Plaintiff Brown, on her own behalf, asserts herein claims pursuant to the District of \nColumbia Human Rights Act, District of Columbia Code § 2-1401.01 et seq., and the Civil Rights \nAct of 1866 Discrimination Based on Race in the Making and Enforcing of Contracts 42 U.S.C. \n§1981(a) by way of, through and via 42 U.S.C. § 1983. \n559.

Plaintiff Carr began her employment with MPD in April of 1998.   \n584.  Plaintiff Carr was one of only three (3) Black female officers in her class of predominately \nwhite men, and one Black man.  \n86 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 87 of 208\n \n585.  Despite the imbalance of her class, and a pattern of sexist and racist comments, and acts \nof favoritism shown the white male trainees, Plaintiff Carr was selected to be a squad leader for a \nportion of the training. \n586.  After her time at the police academy, Plaintiff Carr was assigned to the Sixth District Police \nStation.  \n587.  At the time of her initial training and during her first MPD assignment, Plaintiff Carr was \na United States Army National Guard soldier.  Plaintiff’s Army specialty was as a vehicle repair \nspecialist. \n588.  As such, she was required to drive to Ft. Pickett, Virginia one weekend per month to fulfill \nher reserve duties and obligations.  \n589.  Plaintiff Carr had completed four (4) years of active-duty services in the United States \nArmy before joining the MPD, and it was her desire and intention to serve in the reserve component \nfor a full twenty (20) year career, and to earn a full reservist retirement with all benefits related \nthereto.    \n590.  Despite the fact that her service in the Army Reserve was protected by Federal Law, the \nSixth District leadership refused to work with her to fulfill her obligation, forcing her to remain on \nduty late on Fridays when she had reserve drill, thus incumbering her ability to reach Ft. Pickett \non time.  \n591.  Furthermore, even though Plaintiff had leave to complete her two-weeks-per-year reserve \nobligation, and the fact that such service is protected by law, the Commander of the 6th District to  \nmade it very challenging to get the time off that she needed. \n592.  The obstacles and push-back Plaintiff Carr received from her superiors when it came to \nfulfilling her reserve duty became so stressful, that she ultimately had to resign from the Army \n87 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 88 of 208\n \nReserve, and relinquish and abandon the time-in-service equity she had built towards a full 20-\nyear reservist retirement. \n593.  At the time, several male MPD officers were also military reservists, and were given both \nthe time off, and all reasonable accommodation needed to fulfill their reserve without difficulty.  \n594.  When Plaintiff Carr complained to her leadership about the disparity in treatment, her \nconcerns were ignored.  \n595.  This was the first serious circumstance in Plaintiff Carr’s career at  MPD when her \nmanagement subjected Plaintiff to unequal and disparate terms and conditions of employment \nbased on her race and gender.  \n596.  MPD offered Plaintiff  Carr no recourse to address the disparate treatment from her \nleadership, and established a pattern of dismissing and ignoring concerns raised by Plaintiff.   \n597.  From 2001-2002, Plaintiff  Carr was detailed to the Harbor Patrol Branch of MPD during \na recovery from knee surgery.    \n598.  Plaintiff  Carr did an excellent job while in that department, and the Harbor Master at the \ntime Lt. Paul  Niepling (hereinafter  “Lt. Niepling”), requested that Plaintiff be permanently \nassigned to the Harbor Patrol Branch.  \n599.  Plaintiff  Carr asked her leadership for the permanent reassignment, but her request was \ndenied.  No explanation was given to Plaintiff  Carr for the denial of her request.  \n600.  Instead, a male officer was assigned to the Harbor Patrol Branch and Plaintiff  Carr was \nsent back to the Sixth District.   \n601.  Plaintiff Carr asserts and alleges that she was denied a desirable job opportunity because \nof her race  and gender, and that such denial had a  continuing  effect  on her  earnings  and \npromotional opportunities.  \n88 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 89 of 208\n \n602.  In 2002 Plaintiff Carr attempted to expand her developmental and job opportunities by \napplying to be a helicopter pilot. \n603.  Plaintiff Carr took the swim test and was one of the only female police officers to pass the \nstrenuous test.  \n604.  Plaintiff Carr successfully passed all of the interview and testing components of the \nselection process, and was selected for the position, which was posted by teletype announcing \nPlaintiff as selected for the Air Support Unit.  \n605.  The departmental Sergeant, Steve Smith (hereinafter “Sgt. Smith), a white male, was \nunhappy that Plaintiff had been selected over a white male that Sgt. Smith favored, and accused \nPlaintiff, without evidence of any kind, of cheating on the swim test.  \n606.  The swim test portion was monitored by Lt. Niepling of Harbor Patrol, and several other \nsupervisors were present.  None of the people who witnessed the test accused Plaintiff Carr of any \nimpropriety with respect to the swim test.  \n607.  While this dispute regarding assignment to the Air Support Branch was transpiring, in \n2003, Plaintiff Carr applied to be transferred to the Patrol K9 Unit and the EOD K-9 Unit, to have \nan opportunity to work with police dogs. \n608.  was selected to take the EOD K-9 training test, but never received the notice to report to \nthe Physical Training (“PT”) part of the test.   \n609.  Plaintiff Carr later discovered that Commander William Dandridge (hereinafter “Cdr. \nDandridge”), intentionally sabotaged Plaintiff getting the notification of the test in order to take \nfrom her the opportunity to go to the EOD K-9 unit.  \n89 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 90 of 208\n \n610.  Plaintiff Carr went directly to (then) Cdr. Cathy Lanier, who was the Commander of SOD \nat the time, to complain about what had happened, and was told that there was nothing that could \nbe done, and that she should focus on patrol duties.  \n611.  No investigation or disciplinary action was taken against Cdr. Dandridge for sabotaging \nPlaintiff’s opportunity by MPD management.  Plaintiff’s concern and complaint was simply \nignored. \n612.  By chance, a few weeks later, one of Plaintiff Carr’s colleagues (not Plaintiff’s supervisor \nor management team) informed her of the date and time of an upcoming PT test for the Patrol K-\n9 Unit. \n613.  Plaintiff Carr was the only female officer who was able to pass the PT portion of the K-9 \ntest and advance to the interview portion for selection.  \n614.  Plaintiff Carr, who had a side job as a dog groomer, received one of the highest scores \nduring  the  interview  portion  because  of  her  extensive  knowledge  of  dogs,  and  held  two \ncertifications for dog grooming and handling.  \n615.  Despite her strong testing and performance, Sergeant Duane Beuthe (hereinafter “Sgt \nBeuthe”)  interceded to keep Plaintiff from being transferred to the Patrol K-9 unit.   \n616.  When asked about his objection to Plaintiff Carr going to Patrol K-9 Unit, Sgt. Beuthe \nindicated that the work of the Patrol K-9 Unit was too rigorous, and that Plaintiff Carr would be \nbetter suited to the EOD K-9 unit because it did “less work.” \n617.  Plaintiff Carr asserts that Sgt. Beuthe had a problem with female officers being in the K-9 \nPatrol unit, and acted to limit the job opportunities for women officers who wanted to work with \npolice dogs.  \n90 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 91 of 208\n \n618.  Plaintiff Carr immediately complained about the unfair and disparate treatment that she \nwas being subjected to, speaking with her union representative Bernard Richardson, to see if she \nhad recourse under the terms of the collective bargaining agreement.   \n619.  Plaintiff Carr filed a grievance over the unfair treatment with the support of her union.  \n620.  Because Plaintiff Carr was willing to escalate the matter and speak out against the gender \nbias within the K-9 Patrol Unit, she was labeled a “trouble-maker” and subjected to systematic and \nrepetitive retaliation.  \n621.  Plaintiff Carr, with the assistance of her union, again escalated matters to Cdr. Lanier  \nexplaining that she was being discriminated against in by both the Air Support Branch and the K-\n9 Units, because of her race and gender.  \n622.  In order to appease Plaintiff Carr, and get her to drop her grievance, Cdr. Lanier agreed to \ngive Plaintiff Carr her choice of the Air Support Unit or the K-9 Unit.  \n623.  However, Cdr. Lanier discouraged Plaintiff Carr from choosing the Air Support Unit by \nwarning Plaintiff Carr of the challenges of working for a sexist Sergeant.   \n624.  Cdr. Lanier did not take any action to address Sgt. Smith or Sgt. Beuthe’s discriminatory \nactions or attitudes. \n625.  Plaintiff chose the K-9 Unit, but was denied K-9 Patrol, even though she had earned a \nposition in that Unit, and settled for the EOD K-9 Unit. Plaintiff Carr went to EOD K-9 Unit in \n2003. \n626.  In 2006, Plaintiff Carr filed an OHR complaint alleging gender discrimination, because she \nwas consistently treated less favorably than male officers in the SOD K-9 Unit.  \n627.  Plaintiff Carr’s complaint was not taken seriously, and was dismissed without thorough \ninvestigation.  \n91 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 92 of 208\n \n628.  Immediately  thereafter,  Plaintiff  Carr  was  subjected  to  an  even  more  hostile  work \nenvironment, suffering from snide and sexist comments from her co-workers, and even more \nunfavorable treatment.  \n629.  Importantly, no disciplinary action was taken against Sgt. Smith or Sgt. Greg Jackson \n(hereinafter “Sgt. Jackson”) for the blatantly sexist and discriminatory treatment of Plaintiff Carr.  \n630.  No disciplinary action was taken against Sgt. Smith for maligning Plaintiff Carr’s character \nand defaming her by falsely accusing her of cheating on the Air Support swim test.  \n631.  In 2010, Plaintiff Carr position in the EOD K-9 Unit was unilaterally eliminated by \nmanagement, and despite a still-pending union grievance on the matter, Plaintiff was transferred \nto the Special Events Branch in 2011.  \n632.  Plaintiff Carr continued to suffer from retaliation and a hostile work environment while in \nSpecial Events Branch, but was afraid to file another EEO complaint because of the retaliation she \nsuffered from the 2006 complaint.  \n633.  In 2014, at the request of Cdr. Steven Sund (hereinafter “Capt. Sund), Plaintiff Carr was \ntransferred to the Administrative Office.  \n634.  However, when Cdr. Sund retired,  (then) Captain  Robert Glover  (hereinafter  “Capt. \nGlover”) began taking steps to force Plaintiff Carr out of the Administrative Department and \nreplace her with a white male officer, Robert Wells (hereinafter “Officer Wells”).  \n635.  Plaintiff Carr successfully completed her job duties in the Administrative Department, \nwithout serious error or the need for substantial revision of her work, for three years.   \n636.  Yet, the excuse that Capt. Glover gave for replacing Plaintiff Carr with Officer Wells was \nthat Officer Wells was “college educated.” \n637.  A college degree was never required, or even particularly relevant, for the position. \n92 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 93 of 208\n \n638.  Plaintiff Carr was then transferred against her wishes to the Special Events/Escort Unit \nfrom the Administrative Department in 2016, and the hostile and unfair treatment aimed at Plaintiff \nCarr continued.  \n639.  In 2019, Plaintiff Carr filed an EEO complaint alleging unfair treatment, disparate terms \nand conditions of employment, and a hostile work environment.   \n640.  Because MPD’s EEO Officer, Mr. Lee had a practice of leaking what complainants said in \nEEO interviews, Plaintiff’s accusations against Lt. Andrew Margiotta (hereinafter “Lt. Margiotta”) \nand Capt. Glover made it immediately back to them. \n641.  Thereafter, the retaliation against Plaintiff Carr began to escalate.   \n642.  It increased so much that Plaintiff Carr went directly to the Chief of Homeland Security \nBureau (hereinafter “HSB”), Jeffrey Carroll (hereinafter “Chief Carroll”) to complain.   \n643.  Chief Carroll dismissed and ignored Plaintiff Carr’s complaints, and took no action against \neither Sgt. James Rogers (hereinafter “Sgt. Rogers”) or Lt. Margiotta, both white male officers, \nfor their consistent and concerted efforts to bully Plaintiff, and undermine her ability to do her job. \n644.  Plaintiff’s supervisors routinely withheld vital information from her, gave her undesirable \nassignments that they would not give to others, issued discipline for small mistakes that were not \nsubject to discipline when other officers made the same mistakes, and unfairly and harshly \nevaluated Plaintiff’s performance.  \n645.  For  example,  Sgt.  Rogers  unilaterally  revoked  Plaintiff  Carr’s  “expected  tardiness \nprivilege,” which is given to officers to allow them to manage their respective schedules, when \nnecessary, without punishment.   \n646.  Sgt. Rogers had absolutely no basis for doing so. Plaintiff Carr had zero tardies during that \nperiod, so she had in no way abused the privilege.   \n93 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 94 of 208\n \n647.  The revocation was just an act of unnecessary and disparate harshness against Plaintiff \nCarr.  \n648.  Plaintiff  Carr  was  systematically  attacked,  undermined,  isolated,  held  to  impossible \nstandards, and unfairly disciplined, and when she complained to EEO, her complaints would go \nback to the people she was seeking EEO assistance to investigate and reign in. \n649.  Plaintiff suffered such severe bullying and hostility at work that it impacted her mental \nhealth and caused extreme stress, anxiety and depression. Plaintiff was seen by the MPD physician, \nbut denied that she needed extended care because she feared it would be used as an excuse to \nterminate her employment.  \n650.  Plaintiff Carr’s fears were corroborated when the Director of the DC Fire and Police Clinic, \nMatthew Miranda, shared Plaintiff’s private medical  information  with  Mr. Lee without her \nconsent, which was a violation of Plaintiff Carr’s HIPPA rights, and further chilled her willingness \nto seek assistance for her hostile work-environment-related stress and anxiety.  \n651.  On or about August 19, 2020, the ERT Sgt. Boyd got into a confrontation with Plaintiff  \nCarr during roll call.   \n652.  He  then  filed  an  EEO  complaint  against  Plaintiff  Carr  for  creating  a  hostile  work \nenvironment for him, even though he outranked her, and she had no power over him.  \n653.  At the time, Sgt. Boyd had already been the subject of several EEO complaints from several \ndifference female officers. \n654.  Sgt. Boyd filed his EEO Complaint against Plaintiff Carr as an act of aggression and \nretaliation. \n655.  Unlike  Plaintiff  Carr’s  EEO  Complaints,  Sgt.  Boyd’s  complaint  was  immediately \ninvestigated, and Plaintiff Carr was threatened with a 30-day suspension.  \n94 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 95 of 208\n \n656.  The  EEO  Officer,  Mr.  Harry  Carter  (hereinafter  “Mr.  Carter”)  who  conducted  the \ninvestigation and interviewed the witnesses to the incident, concluded that Sgt. Boyd was the one \nat fault, and dismissed the complaint.  \n657.  Mr. Lee then interceded, demanding that Mr. Carter alter his findings, and eventually fired \nMr. Carter for refusing to issue discipline against Plaintiff, in defiance of Mr. Lee’s unlawful \ndemand that Mr. Carter do so.  \n658.  Although Plaintiff Carr narrowly escaped discipline for her role in the incident, she was \nunable to get any MPD management to take her allegations against Sgt. Boyd seriously, and he \nwas not disciplined for his act of bad faith bullying and retaliation.  \n659.  Because MPD refused to act against male officers who bullied Plaintiff Carr, the retaliatory \nand hostile behavior continued.  \n660.  In February of 2020, Plaintiff Carr went to her CDR Guillermo Riveira (hereinafter “Cdr. \nRivera”), the new commander of SOD, with a recording of a confrontation between herself and \nLt. Margiotta.   \n661.  However, Cdr. Rivera refused to even listen to the recording, and again dismissed Plaintiff \nCarr’s concerns.  \n662.  Despite the fact that Plaintiff Carr’s recording of the incident proved that Lt. Margiotta lied \nduring an investigation by Internal Affairs, MPD management disciplined Plaintiff and suspended \nher for twenty-five (25) days for having recorded the incident. \n663.  Recording incidents is not unlawful in the District of Columbia, and does not require the \nconsent of the person recorded to be lawful. \n95 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 96 of 208\n \n664.  Plaintiff Carr was reduced to having to record the hostile work environment she was \ndealing with because neither MPD EEO, nor any of her chain of command would take her \ncomplaints seriously or believe her.  \n665.  On Plaintiff Carr’s behalf, the Union appealed the suspension and went directly to the Chief \nContee to obtain redress for the unfair discipline. \n666.  Plaintiff Carr also appealed directly to Chief Contee about the racism, sexism, hostile work \nenvironment, and retaliation that she was enduring on the job.   \n667.  In a ruse to get Plaintiff Carr to voluntarily leave the SOD department, in lieu of having to \ninvoluntarily transfer her out, which could and would have been appealed, SOD management \nentered into an agreement with Plaintiff that if she “voluntarily” transferred, they would rescind \nthe disciplinary suspension for the recording. \n668.  Plaintiff  Carr had no desire to transfer into yet another department, but felt that she had no \nreal choice, and did not want a long suspension on her record for an incident in which she was not \nat fault.  \n669.  Plaintiff Carr therefore signed the agreement, and was transferred out of SOD.  \n670.  MPD then reneged on the agreement and suspended Plaintiff Carr anyway, demonstrating \nhow unfair, biased, and unjust it was willing to be to Black women officers. \n671.  Plaintiff Carr has since returned to work, but lives in constant fear and stress of the \nretaliation, discrimination and unfair treatment she continues to be subject to at the MPD. \n    Plaintiff Carr’s Individual Causes of Action \n  Race Discrimination and Retaliation Claims \n672.  Plaintiff Carr incorporates and restates all of the previous factual allegations contained in \nthis Complaint as if fully restated herein. \n96 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 97 of 208\n \n673.

Plaintiff  Carr  was  treated  disparately,  subjected  to  a  hostile  work  environment  and \nretaliated against for complaining about and opposing the race discrimination to which she was \nsubjected.  \n675.  The facts alleged above, if proven, constitute discrimination, and systematic retaliation \nsevere and pervasive enough to be compensable. \n676.  The facts alleged above, taken in conjunction with the facts alleged by the other nine (9) \nCRPs, establish that Defendant maintained a pattern and practice of race discrimination against \nBlack women police officers on the basis of race.  \n677.  The facts alleged by Plaintiff Carr that establish that she was treated disparately than her \nnon-Black-female colleagues, are typical of, and consistent with, the claims of the other nine (9) \nCRPs. \n678.  As a direct and proximate cause of the hostile work environment fostered by Defendant, \nPlaintiff Carr was humiliated, embarrassed and made to endure constant stress and anxiety, \ndepression, lack of sleep and other symptoms that caused her severe mental anguish.   \n679.  Plaintiff Carr has incurred lost wages, loss of reputation and loss of career opportunity now \nand into the future, and all the other losses stated herein. \n97 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 98 of 208\n \n680.

The facts alleged above, if proven, constitute discrimination, and systematic retaliation \nsevere and pervasive enough to be compensable. \n685.  The facts alleged above, taken in conjunction with the facts alleged by the other nine (9) \nCRPs, establish that Defendant maintained a pattern and practice of race discrimination against \nBlack women police officers on the basis of sex.  \n686.  The facts alleged by Plaintiff Carr that establish that she was treated disparately than her \nmale colleagues, are typical of, and consistent with, the claims of the other nine (9) CRPs. \n687.  As a direct and proximate cause of the hostile work environment fostered by Defendant, \nPlaintiff Brinkley was humiliated, embarrassed and made to endure constant stress and anxiety, \ndepression, lack of sleep and other symptoms that caused her severe mental anguish.   \n98 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 99 of 208\n \n688.

Plaintiff  Carr  engaged  in  protected  disclosures  when  she  reported  race  and  gender \ndiscrimination to the Chief of Police. \n693.  As a direct result of Plaintiff Carr’s protected disclosures, Defendants systematically and \ncontinuously retaliated against Plaintiff, including but not limited to unwarranted disciplinary \nactions against Plaintiff, isolation and separation from coworkers, unfavorable treatment and \nassignments, false and inaccurate performance evaluation and ultimately termination. \n694.  As a result of Defendants’ actions, Plaintiff Carr suffered significant economic harm in the \nform of loss of employment, corresponding salary, loss of employment opportunities, damage to \nher professional reputation, and significant mental and emotional distress. \n99 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 100 of 208\n \n695.

Plaintiff Leslie Clark began her employment with the MPD in May of 1989.  She was \ninitially assigned to Seventh District. \n699.  In April of 2001, she was transferred to SOD, and worked there until 2014. \n700.  Plaintiff Clark’s tenure with the MPD was relatively uneventful until on or about \nJuly 11, 2012.  On that date, while sitting at a restaurant having breakfast with her partner Officer \nDarren Edwards, the subject came up about the then First Lady, Michelle Obama’s threat level. \n701.  During the conversation, Officer Christopher Picciano, a white male, told Plaintiff Clark \nthat he wanted to kill First Lady Michelle Obama, and showed Plaintiff Clark a picture of a gun \nthat he indicated he was going to use to do it.  \n702.  Plaintiff Clark had every reason to take the threat seriously, as on occasion, MPD officers \nprovide added security to events in Washington, DC at which the President and First Lady could \nhave been present. \n703.  Plaintiff Clark reported the threat to IAD, as she believed it was her sworn duty to do.  \n100 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 101 of 208\n \n704.  It is unclear if IAD investigated the claim, but it leaked to others that Plaintiff Clark had \nreported the threat.  \n705.  Thereafter, all the white officers and several white MPD officials started treating Plaintiff \nClark differently.  No members of MPD senior leadership stepped in to manage the situation. \n706.  Thereafter, Plaintiff Clark was isolated and shunned by her peers, and consistently given \ndangerous and undesirable assignments by her supervisor Sgt. Steve Urps (hereinafter “Sgt. Urps”) \nand (then) Lt. Glover. \n707.  In July of 2012, Officer John Felenchak (hereinafter “Lt. Felenchak”) approached Plaintiff \nClark, and told her that she needed to “mind [her] mother-f****ing business,” (or words to that \neffect). \n708.  Plaintiff Clark was labeled “a snitch,” and MPD leadership, including Sgt. Urps and Lt. \nGlover nurtured and permitted to flourish a work environment in which officers were told to watch \nout for Plaintiff Clark and to ostracize her.  \n709.  Plaintiff Clark went to the MPD EEO office to complain about the way she was being \ntreated.   \n710.  EEO did not take her claims seriously, failed to investigate or intervene in any way, and \nallowed Plaintiff to continue to be subject to a hostile work environment.  \n711.  Plaintiff Clark ultimately chose to retire, on or about May 31, 2014. \n712.  However,  because  of  manning  shortages,  MPD  asked  Plaintiff  Clark  to  return  to \nemployment as an SPO. \n713.  On or about February 6, 2017, Plaintiff Clark returned to MPD in the Special Operations \nDepartment as an SPO. \n101 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 102 of 208\n \n714.  On or about February 18, 2017, Lt. Margiotta informed Plaintiff Clark that she would not \nallow her to work the day schedule, and that he was permanently assigning her to the evening shift.  \nLt. Margiotta gave no explanation or justification for this decision.   \n715.  This schedule presented a hardship for Plaintiff Clark because of her family obligations.  \n716.  On or about February 26, 2017, Plaintiff Clark asked Lt. Margiotta if she could replace \nSPO Chris Coles, who was on day shift, but was being transferred out of the department. Without \nexplanation or justification, Lt. Margiotta refused Plaintiff’s request.  \n717.  Approximately three weeks later, Plaintiff Clark requested to work a modified shift, as was \nallowed for Officer Felenchak. \n718.  Lt. Margiotta asked Plaintiff Clark what hours what hours she was actually requesting.  \nWhen she told him 1100-1900, he refused to allow it, insisting that Plaintiff was only going to be \nallowed to work night shifts.  \n719.  Officer Felenchak, a white male, was allowed to change his tour of duty when he wanted \nto, in order to accommodate his home life. \n720.  Other, similarly situated  officers in the department who were not Black women were \nallowed to switch from a night to a day schedule, or vice versa. \n721.  Plaintiff Clark was singled out for disparate and harsher treatment because of her race and \ngender, and because of the racial and gender animus of Lt. Margiotta.   \n722.  On or about March 8, 2017, Plaintiff Clark requested to speak with Capt. Glover about the \nharsh and inflexible schedule she was placed on by Lt. Margiotta. Plaintiff Clark asked if she could \nwork a modified shift to ease the burden on her and her family.  Capt. Glover did not immediately \nrespond to Plaintiff Clark. \n102 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 103 of 208\n \n723.  On or about March 10, 2017, Plaintiff Clark went back to Capt. Glover who informed \nPlaintiff Clark that she was not allowed to work a day schedule, and that he would not let Plaintiff \nClark work a modified shift until some unspecified time when there would be new hires.  \n724.  Plaintiff Clark was later informed by Officer Arnett Perkins that Capt. Glover went into a \nrampage when he found out that Plaintiff was returning to the MPD as an SPO, because he had \npersonal animus against Plaintiff Clark, and was infuriated that he was not consulted prior to her \nreturn.  \n725.  Plaintiff Clark was assigned to the Vice-Presidential escort detail in the Special Events \ndivision of SOD. \n726.  However, Plaintiff Clark was assigned the least secure vehicle in the fleet to do her work.  \n727.  Plaintiff Clark was assigned the “plate reader car,” which used by the SOD Events unit to \nrun the license plates of cars along the routes that would be traveled by the President or Vice \nPresident, to make sure there were no suspicious vehicles on the route.  \n728.  The “plate reader” vehicle was a sedan, without reinforced ballistic-proof doors. All other \nvehicles in the detail were heavy SUV/Truck with ballistic doors.  \n729.  On or about April 26, 2017, Plaintiff Clark asked Lt. Margiotta if she could be assigned a \nvehicle that had ballistic doors because she was working the more dangerous evening schedule.  \n730.  For no apparent reason, Lt. Margiotta denied the request and forced Plaintiff Clark to \ncontinue using the “plate reader” unreinforced sedan vehicle. \n731.  Plaintiff Clark worked the Vice-Presidential detail as her permanent assignment. \n732.  By contrast, Officer Anna DaRoo (hereinafter “Officer DaRoo”) (white female).  Officer \nDaRoo was assigned a new ballistic door SUV/Truck even though she was only on temporarily \nassignment to SOD from the 4th District. \n103 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 104 of 208\n \n733.  Plaintiff Clark, who had the permanent Vice-Presidential escort assignment, was denied \nthe appropriate and safer vehicle because she is Black and female, and because her superior \nharbored animus against her because of her race and gender. \n734.  Unsure what to do about her superior’s racial and gender animus, Plaintiff asked her union \nrepresentative, Officer Michael Pratt (hereinafter “Officer Pratt”), what to do.  \n735.  Officer Pratt went to speak with Lt. Margiotta about switching Plaintiff Clark to a day \nschedule.   \n736.  Officer Charles Marshall (hereinafter “Officer Marshall”) was in the room when Lt. \nMargiotta and Officer Pratt spoke about Plaintiff Clark’s schedule.  \n737.  During that meeting, Lt. Margiotta asserted that Plaintiff could file whatever paperwork \nshe wanted to file, but that he was never going to change Plaintiff’s work schedule from the \nevening shift.  \n738.  Again, no explanation or justification was given for Lt. Margiotta’s position other than \npersonal racial and gender animus.  \n739.  In September of 2019, Plaintiff Clark asked for a temporary schedule change to help take \ncare of her granddaughter who had suffered second degree burns on her stomach and legs.  \n740.  At the time, Officer Shawn Caldwell (hereinafter “Officer Caldwell)(white male) was \nseeking to switch from the day schedule to an evening schedule.  Thus, there was day shift work \navailable for Plaintiff Clark.  \n741.  Instead of giving Plaintiff Clark the temporary day shift she requested, Lt. Margiotta moved \ntwo white male officers to day schedule, Officer Michael Tucker and Officer David Baker, to \nprohibit Plaintiff Clark from being able to workdays.  \n104 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 105 of 208\n \n742.  Again, there was no basis or justification for this decision other than animus towards \nPlaintiff Clark.  \n743.  Lt. Margiotta routinely allowed officers in the department to trade days off to accommodate \nfamily events.  On or about May 21, 2020, Plaintiff requested to change one of her days off to \nattend her niece’s graduation. \n744.  Lt. Margiotta refused to allow the trade of days off for Plaintiff Clark, and forced her to \nuse a day of leave instead.  This was yet another example of disparate and unfair treatment leveled \nat Plaintiff Clark.  \n745.  A month later during the Black Lives Matter protest, when all days off were cancelled and \nleave was restricted, SPO Christopher Bell (hereinafter “Officer Bell”)(white male) was granted \nleave by Lt. Margiotta for his daughter’s virtual graduation.   \n746.  In July of  2020 while Plaintiff Clark was on limited duty, Sgt. Jane Barrientos told Plaintiff \nClark that Cdr. Rivera put out a memo stating that persons on limited duty had to report to work \nin “courtroom” attire.  \n747.  However, Officer Charles Marshall (black male) and Officer David Baker (white male) \ncame to work in jeans, t-shirts, and tennis shoes.  Essentially, Cdr. Rivera’s “rule” did not apply \nto male officers he favored.  \n748.  In March of 2019, Former SPO Arlinda Page (hereinafter “SPO Page”), in the Traffic Unit, \nrequested of Capt. Glover that Plaintiff be allowed to replace her. The unit’s Lieutenant, Ronald \nWilkins (hereinafter “Lt. Wilkins”) told Plaintiff Clark that he would speak with Capt. Glover \nabout allowing Plaintiff to fill the Traffic Unit vacancy. \n105 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 106 of 208\n \n749.  Lt. Wilkins later told SPO Page that he did not talk to Capt. Glover because he already \nknew that Capt. Glover was going to say no.  Plaintiff Clark thus lost a job opportunity because of \nthe racial and gender animus of Cpt. Glover. \n750.  On or about August 19, 2020, Plaintiff approached Lt. Walter Flemings in the Time and \nAttendance  Department  (hereinafter  “Lt.  Flemings.”)    Plaintiff  Clark  had  worked  in  that \nDepartment for ten (10) years before becoming an SPO, so was very well qualified for the position.  \n751.  On August 25, 2020, Cdr. Rivera denied Plaintiff Clark’s request for the transfer, giving \nLt. Flemings no justification or explanation for the denial.  \n752.  On  or  about  August  29,  2020,  Plaintiff  Clark  met  with  Cdr.  Rivera  and  her  union \nrepresentative, Officer (and Plaintiff herein) Tabatha Knight.  \n753.  At the meeting, Plaintiff Clark asked Cdr. Rivera if she could be detailed to work during \nthe day schedule in order to accommodate her family needs. Cdr. Rivera denied her request \nbecause, according to him, it would generate too many complaints from other (non-Black female) \nofficers.  \n754.  Plaintiff Clark then asked if she could be moved to a different division in SOD.  Cdr. Rivera \nflatly refused to answer her question. \n755.  In May of 2020, Plaintiff Clark learned that Officer Knight was retiring and going to leave \nher position on the Crash Review Board, which was an administrative position.  Officer Knight \nindicated that Plaintiff was well qualified for the position, and Plaintiff asked Cpt. Glover to be \ntransferred to that office.  \n756.  Instead of granting Plaintiff’s request, which would have been best for the MPD, Cpt. \nGlover tried to force Officer Charles Culver (hereinafter “Officer Culver”) to take the job.  Officer \nCulver had no administrative experience and did not want the job. \n106 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 107 of 208\n \n757.  Again, MPD management went out of its way to deny Plaintiff Clark job opportunities, \nand to treat her harshly and with clear animus and hostility, because of her race and gender.  \n758.  Similarly situated officer in SOD, who are not Black females, frequently asked for and \nwere granted job and schedule changes.  Such requests were denied to Plaintiff Clark and other \nBlack women officers.  \n759.  Upon information and belief Cdr. Riveria, Cpt. Glover and Lt. Margiotta harbor racial \nanimus against Plaintiff Clark, and were overheard talking about their specific intent to retaliate \nagainst her have pushed out of the MPD. \n760.  On or about July 24, 2020, Lt. Margiotta wrote Plaintiff Clark up because she came to work \non limited duty on the day shift schedule, and worked the entire week, Monday thru Friday, on \nday shift.  \n761.  Plaintiff Clark broke no rules or policies in doing so, and was free to do so because she \nwas on limited duty. \n762.  Lt. Margiotta wrote Plaintiff up for doing so because for one week, she thwarted his \nconcerted and intentional campaign to harass and attack her, and prohibit her from working her \npreferred schedule.  \n763.  Once she found out she was going to be disciplined for working the day shift, Plaintiff \nClark called IAD to ascertain the status of the investigation into her actions. IAD refused to speak \nto Plaintiff about the status of the discipline.  \n764.  Instead of allowing Plaintiff Clark to work the day shift while she was limited duty, when \nthere was work to be done, Lt. Margiotta forced Plaintiff to evening shift, when there was nothing \nto do.   \n107 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 108 of 208\n \n765.  Plaintiff Clark ended up sitting in the locker room for the duration of her schedule because \nthere was no work for her to complete. \n766.  This episode was another example of intentional hostile and abusive treatment of Plaintiff \nClark, to the actual detriment of the MPD, by Lt. Margiotta, for the sole purpose of fostering a \nhostile work environment.  \n767.  Plaintiff Clark’s Union Steward, Officer Rosario, had to ask management three separate \ntimes for the status of the investigation into Plaintiff Clark’s actions, before he was told that Cpt. \nGlover had cancelled the investigation. \n768.  In October 2020, the Department Sergeant, Keith Jackson (hereinafter “Sgt. Jackson”) gave \neveryone in his squad, including Plaintiff, a #4 rating on their performance evaluations, which \nmeant he had to write a memo justifying the #4 ratings.  \n769.  Cdr. Rivera approved everyone in the department getting a #4 rating on their performance \nevaluation, except Plaintiff, who was given a #3 rating, with no explanation as to why she would \nbe singled out for a lower rating.  \n770.  Union Steward Rosario requested that Plaintiff’s rating be changed back to a #4, but MPD \nhas refused to do so.  \n771.  Plaintiff Clark asserts that her #3 performance evaluation rating is fraudulent and the result \nof racial and gender animus, and was modified by MPD management in retaliation for Plaintiff’s \nengagement in protected activity. \nPlaintiff Clark’s Individual Causes of Action \n  Race Discrimination and Retaliation Claims \n772.  Plaintiff Clark incorporates and restates all of the previous factual allegations contained \nin this Complaint as if fully restated herein. \n108 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 109 of 208\n \n773.  Plaintiff Clark, on her own behalf, asserts herein claims pursuant to Title VII of the Civil \nRights Act of 1964, as amended, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e, et seq.;  the District of Columbia Human \nRights Act, District of Columbia Code § 2-1401.01 et seq., and the Civil Rights Act of 1866 \nDiscrimination Based on Race in the Making and Enforcing of Contracts 42 U.S.C. §1981(a) by \nway of, through and via 42 U.S.C. § 1983. \n774.  Plaintiff Clark was treated disparately, subjected to a hostile work environment and \nretaliated against for complaining about and opposing the race discrimination to which she was \nsubjected.  \n775.  The facts alleged above, if proven, constitute discrimination, and systematic retaliation \nsevere and pervasive enough to be compensable. \n776.  The facts alleged above, taken in conjunction with the facts alleged by the other nine (9) \nCRPs, establish that Defendant maintained a pattern and practice of race discrimination against \nBlack women police officers on the basis of race.  \n777.  The facts alleged by Plaintiff Clark that establish that she was treated disparately than her \nnon-Black-female colleagues, are typical of, and consistent with, the claims of the other nine (9) \nCRPs. \n778.  As a direct and proximate cause of the hostile work environment fostered by Defendant, \nPlaintiff Clark was humiliated, embarrassed and made to endure constant stress and anxiety, \ndepression, lack of sleep and other symptoms that caused her severe mental anguish.   \n779.  Plaintiff Clark has incurred lost wages, loss of reputation and loss of career opportunity \nnow and into the future, and all the other losses stated herein. \n109 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 110 of 208\n \n780.

Plaintiff Clark was treated disparately, subjected to a hostile work environment and \nretaliated against for complaining about and opposing the gender discrimination she to which she \nwas subjected.  \n784.  The facts alleged above, if proven, constitute discrimination, and systematic retaliation \nsevere and pervasive enough to be compensable. \n785.  The facts alleged above, taken in conjunction with the facts alleged by the other nine (9) \nCRPs, establish that Defendant maintained a pattern and practice of race discrimination against \nBlack women police officers on the basis of sex.  \n786.  The facts alleged by Plaintiff Clark that establish that she was treated disparately than her \nmale colleagues, are typical of, and consistent with, the claims of the other nine (9) CRPs. \n787.  As a direct and proximate cause of the hostile work environment fostered by Defendant, \nPlaintiff Brinkley was humiliated, embarrassed and made to endure constant stress and anxiety, \ndepression, lack of sleep and other symptoms that caused her severe mental anguish.   \n110 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 111 of 208\n \n788.  Plaintiff Clark has incurred lost wages, loss of reputation and loss of career opportunity \nnow and into the future, and all the other losses stated herein. \n789.  Plaintiff Clark seeks compensatory damages, and damages for mental pain and suffering, \nabove and beyond recovery as a member of the class, of not less than $250,000.00, plus interest, \ncosts, fees and all other remedies the Court deems appropriate. \n    Whistleblower Retaliation Claim \n790.  Plaintiff Clark incorporates and restates all information and allegations contained in the \npreceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n791.  Pursuant to the District of Columbia Whistleblower Protection Act D.C. Code § 1-615-51 \net seq., Defendants are prohibited from reassigning, terminating or otherwise retaliating against a \nD.C. government employee as a result of that employee’s protected disclosures that the employee \nreasonably believes show gross mismanagement, gross misuse or waste of government resources, \nand abuse of authority in the connection with the administration of a government program, or a \nviolation of a state, local or federal law, rule or regulation.  \n792.  Plaintiff Clark was an employee who, as a result of her disclosures to her supervisors, the \nsenior leadership of her department, the EEO Department of the MPD, Assistant Chief Caron, \nChief Newsham, and Chief Contee about the discrimination at MPD, and the complicity of the \nMPD EEO Department in perpetuating it and protecting those who engage in it, ethical violations \nthat included leaking confidential witness statements, the creation of a chilling and retaliatory work \nculture that discouraged officers from complaining about mistreatment and inappropriate police \nconduct, enjoyed the protection of DCWPA.  \n793.  As a direct result of Plaintiff Clark’s protected disclosures, Defendants systematically and \ncontinuously  retaliated  against  Plaintiff  Clark,  including  but  not  limited  to  unwarranted \n111 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 112 of 208\n \ndisciplinary actions against Plaintiff Clark, isolation and separation from coworkers, unfavorable \ntreatment  and  assignments,  false  and  inaccurate  performance  evaluation  and  ultimately \ntermination. \n794.  Plaintiff Clark was humiliated, embarrassed and made to endure constant stress and \nanxiety, depression, lack of sleep and other symptoms of severe mental anguish. \n795.  Plaintiff Clark has incurred lost wages, loss of reputation and loss of career opportunity \nnow and into the future, and all the other losses stated herein. \n796.

At least in part, because of her age, Plaintiff Clark, a Senior Police Officer was denied sick \nleave, weekend days off, duty assignments, training, and health assessments, while these same \nopportunities and benefits were given to much younger police officers. \n800.  At least in part, Plaintiff Clark was terminated from her employment because of her age, \nand the reasons given for her termination were false and pretextual to hide a discriminatory intent.  \n801.  MPD’s termination of Plaintiff Clark was motivated, at least in part, to retaliate against  her \nfor opposing age discrimination at MPD.  \n112 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 113 of 208\n \n802.

Plaintiff Dickerson joined the MPD in 1988, at the age of 17 as a police cadet. \n806.  In 1990, while assigned to the Seventh District, Plaintiff Dickerson was offered money, \nclothes, and a car by Lieutenant William Roberts (hereinafter Lt. Roberts) and Detective Roosevelt \nAskew (hereinafter “Det. Askew) in exchange for intimate dates and a willingness to perform \nsexual acts. \n807.  Plaintiff Dickerson was told by Lt. Roberts and Det. Askew that she needed to agree to \nintimate dates and sex acts with them in order to be promoted and get good assignments.  \n808.  Plaintiff Dickerson did not welcome or accept their advances, but instead asked to be \ntransferred to the Office of Finance and Resource Management.  \n809.  The hostile environment that she was subject to was one of the reasons why Plaintiff \nDickerson resigned from the MPD in 1991.   \n810.  Plaintiff Dickerson returned to the MPD in 1994 as a civilian employee.   \n113 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 114 of 208\n \n811.  In 1995, Plaintiff Dickerson started being sexually harassed by Lieutenant Benjamin \nPreston (hereinafter “Lt. Preston”), who made continued, unwanted sexual advances on Plaintiff \nDickerson.   \n812.  Plaintiff Dickerson rejected Lt. Preston’s overtures and eventually complained to Captain \nDewey Wiseman about the unlawful and inappropriate advances from Lt. Preston.  \n813.  Rather than being disciplined, Lt. Preston was allowed to remain in his position of authority \nover Plaintiff Dickerson, and immediately began to retaliate against her for reporting his behavior.  \n814.  Lt. Preston reduced Plaintiff Dickerson’s lunch period from an hour to 30 min, while the \none-hour lunch was kept for all other employees. \n815.  Lt. Preston created a log wherein Plaintiff Dickerson had to sign in and out every time she \nleft the office, including for restroom breaks, when no one else was required to do so.   \n816.  Lt. Preston was also seen on several occasions outside of Plaintiff Dickerson’s home, \nsomewhere he had no legitimate business reason to be because she lived in Maryland. \n817.  Cpt. Wiseman took no steps to protect Plaintiff Dickerson from harassment or retaliation, \nand failed to take any meaningful action against Plaintiff Dickerson’s harasser. \n818.  In 1997, while Plaintiff Dickerson was still a probationary patrol officer, Lieutenant Ronnie \nFoye  (hereinafter  “Lt.  Foye”)  made  continued  sexual  advances  and  comments  to  Plaintiff \nDickerson during her training at the Third District.   \n819.  Lt. Foye often commented on Plaintiff Dickerson’s physical attributes and described the \nsexual acts that he wanted to perform on her. \n820.  For example, in one incident that took place in the Fall of 1997, Plaintiff Dickerson’s \ntraining officer, Officer Tonya Longus (hereinafter “Officer Longus”), and Plaintiff Dickerson \n114 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 115 of 208\n \nwere on a police call for service on Georgia Avenue NW, when a citizen asked to speak to a \nsupervisor about an open fire hydrant.   \n821.  Officer Longus summoned Lt. Foye.  Upon arrival on the scene, Lt. Foye kept looking and \ncommenting on Plaintiff Dickerson’s buttocks and breasts.   \n822.  The citizen was so appalled by the lieutenant’s behavior, he sent a written complaint to the \nThird District Commander. \n823.  However, no disciplinary action was taken against Lt. Foye, and no attempt was made to \nprotect Plaintiff Dickerson from Lt. Foye’s unlawful advances.  \n824.  On information and belief, prior to Plaintiff Dickerson’s complaint against Lt. Foye, there \nwas another claim against him  for sexual harassment that was substantiated, but he was not \nterminated. \n825.  From late 1998-2001, Plaintiff Dickerson was again sexually harassed by Sgt. Jaime \nAnderson (hereinafter “Sgt. Anderson”), who made repeated and continual sexual advances and \ncomments to Plaintiff Dickerson.  \n826.  Sgt. Anderson repeatedly asked Plaintiff Dickerson out on dates, and complimented her on \nher lips, buttocks, and breasts.  \n827.  Every time Sgt. Anderson prepared roll call, he would assign Plaintiff Dickerson without \na partner so that he could force her to meet with him at different places within the Third District.    \n828.  If another sergeant assigned Plaintiff Dickerson with a male partner, Sgt. Anderson would \nforce the male partner to walk a foot beat, while forcing Plaintiff Dickerson to meet up with the \nSgt. to complete her shift.   \n829.  Plaintiff  Dickerson’s  complaints  about  Sgt.  Anderson’s  abuse  of  power  and  blatant \nharassment were ignored. \n115 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 116 of 208\n \n830.  Officer Marjorie Temple also made a sexual harassment complaint against Sgt. Anderson.  \nDuring that investigation, Sgt. Anderson admitted to the investigators that he had sexually harassed \nPlaintiff Dickerson, but no action was taken against him. \n831.  After Sgt. Anderson’s targeted harassment of Plaintiff Dickerson, male officers started \nobjecting to partnering with her because they knew Sgt. Anderson would later change their \nassignment. \n832.  Sgt. Anderson was not fired or disciplined for his blatantly unlawful conduct, and MPD \nleadership failed to address a situation that was so obvious it became a common joke at MPD. \n833.  After Plaintiff Dickerson’s complaint, someone drew a caricature of her on the men’s \nbathroom stall at the Third District with a special emphasis on her buttocks and breasts.  This is \nindicative that the message sent by MPD to its officers was that harassment and disrespect of \nwomen officers was acceptable. \n834.  In 2008, while a sergeant at the Fifth District, after exercising, Plaintiff Dickerson was \ntaking a shower in the female locker room.   \n835.  A male employee from D.C Government’s Department of General Services entered the \nshower area after Plaintiff Dickerson asked him not to.   \n836.  Plaintiff Dickerson jumped out of the shower, put on minimal clothing, and ran out of the \nshower area into the general area of the police station to solicit help.   \n837.  She hurriedly went to the sergeant’s office, visibly shaken and upset, and told Sergeant \nTerry Thorne (hereinafter “Sgt. Throne”) what had transpired while she was in the shower.   \n838.  The male employee ran out of the shower area and locked himself in a boiler room.  \n839.  Sgt. Thorne urged the employee to exit the boiler room, and to give his account of what \nhad transpired.   \n116 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 117 of 208\n \n840.  The employee informed Sergeant Thorne that he heard Plaintiff Dickerson tell him not to \nenter the locker room, and that he had heard the water running in the shower, but decided to enter \nanyway because he ostensibly needed to enter to do his job. \n841.  Plaintiff Dickerson complained to Commander Lamar Greene (hereinafter “Cdr. Greene”) \nwho informed his bosses, Chief Cathy Lanier (hereinafter “Chief Lanier”) and Assistant Chief \nDiane Groomes (hereinafter “Chief Groomes), who initially took no action.  \n842.  After Plaintiff Dickerson’s repeated complaints, an internal  affairs investigation was \ninitiated.   \n843.  MPD detectives arrested the male employee, however the United States Attorney’s Office \ncontacted Plaintiff Dickerson and informed her that the case would not be prosecuted because the \nPlaintiff Dickerson “didn’t have authority to tell him not to enter the ladies’ locker room.”  \n844.  Plaintiff Dickerson continued to complain, and an internal investigation was launched by \nthe male employee against Plaintiff Dickerson.    \n845.  Lieutenant Derrick McNeely (hereinafter “Lt. Neely”), Plaintiff Dickerson’s immediate \nsupervisor, informed her that she was the target of an internal investigation, and directed her to \nwrite a statement explaining her actions.   \n846.  After  becoming  visibly  upset,  Plaintiff  Dickerson  explained  the  entire  incident.  Lt. \nMcNeely then apologized to Plaintiff Dickerson and told her that he would let her know if the \nstatement would still be needed. \n847.  Lt. McNeely later returned and informed Plaintiff Dickerson that his bosses had instructed \nhim to move forward with the investigation to ensure that she had not violated the department’s \npolicies. \n117 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 118 of 208\n \n848.  The MPD initiated an investigation into Plaintiff Dickerson as an act of retaliation and an \nattempt to intimidate her, and to make an example out of her to others, in order to discourage the \nreporting of sexual harassment and misconduct.  \n849.  For  the  duration  of  the  investigation  into  Plaintiff  Dickerson  for  reporting  sexual \nharassment and after, she was denied promotion to Lieutenant, while Chief Lanier promoted \npeople who ranked lower than Plaintiff Dickerson on the exam to \"Acting Lieutenant,\" over \nPlaintiff Dickerson, to make sure Plaintiff Dickerson didn't get promoted.   \n850.  By creating “Acting Lieutenants,” Chief Lanier filled the Lieutenant roles thus not allowing \nroom for Plaintiff Dickerson to be promoted on her merit.  Chief Lanier only made male officers \n“Acting Lieutenants.  Some of them ranked lower than Plaintiff Dickerson, and some hadn’t \nranked at all.  \n851.  Chief  Lanier’s  actions  were  retaliatory  in  nature,  and  negatively  affected  Plaintiff \nDickerson’s pay and long-term earning potential.  Furthermore, Chief Lanier circumvented MPD’s \npromotional process. \n852.  In 2012, Plaintiff Dickerson attempted to resolve a situation in which Detective Lieutenant \nPeter Larsen, (hereinafter Det. Lt. Larsen), manager of the Fourth District’s Detectives Unit, sent \nan email to Detective Vandra Covington, in which he used the word “cunt.”   \n853.  Plaintiff Dickerson requested a meeting with Det. Lt. Larsen’s immediate supervisor, \nCaptain Wilfredo Manlapaz (hereinafter “Cpt. Manlapaz).  Det. Lt. Larsen and Cpt. Manlapaz \nwere present for the meeting.  Neither agreed that the term “cunt” was offensive, or offered an \napology, even after Plaintiff Dickerson expressed to both of them that she was also offended by \nthe email.   \n118 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 119 of 208\n \n854.  Cpt. Manlapaz told Plaintiff Dickerson that she should focus on Detective Covington’s \nperformance not a term that she viewed as offensive.   \n855.  Plaintiff Dickerson explained that Det. Covington was not under Plaintiff Dickerson’s \nimmediate supervision, however due to the MPD’s implementation of a new technological case \nmanagement system, that they should develop a training plan for the detective if they had concerns \nabout her performance, but that using foul language was not acceptable.   \n856.  Lastly,  Plaintiff  Dickerson  explained  that  the  term  “cunt”  must  have  been  used  so \nfrequently by Det. Lt. Larsen that it auto populated on his cellphone.  Plaintiff Dickerson had to \nshow Chief Manlapaz that the MPD email system flagged the term as offensive, when Plaintiff \nDickerson tried to forward Det. Lt. Larsen’s email to a non-government email account.   \n857.  Both Chief Manlapaz and Det. Lt. Larsen continued to deflect, and refused to consider that \nDet. Covington was entitled to greater respect than to be called a “cunt,” regardless of their \nopinions about her performance.  Shortly thereafter, Detective Covington, the victim of Det. Lt. \nLarsen’s sexism and disrespect, was transferred to the Seventh District’s Detectives Unit. \n858.  As a result of this incident, Plaintiff Dickerson was called before Commander George \nKucik (hereinafter “Cdr. Kucik,” and Captain William Fitzgerald (hereinafter “Cpt. Fitzgerald”), \nand told that she should voluntarily transfer out of the department, which Plaintiff Dickerson \ninterpreted as both a threat and blatant act of retaliation.  \n859.  Plaintiff Dickerson left the meeting dejected but did not request a transfer. Instead, she \ncomplained to Assistant Chief Peter Newsham who was Commander Kucik’s boss at the time of \nthe incident.  No action was taken against any of the males involved and Chief Newsham urged \nPlaintiff Dickerson not to transfer to another division.   \n119 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 120 of 208\n \n860.  Plaintiff Dickerson continued to work directly for Det. Lt. Larsen until July of 2014.  After \nthat incident, Det. Lt. Larsen refused to have in-person or telephone conversation with her. He \nonly communicated with Plaintiff Dickerson by email.  \n861.  According to written MPD policy, referring to a woman as a “cunt,” is not acceptable.  \n862.  Det. Larsen was never reprimanded or disciplined for his use of sexist and derogatory \nlanguage to a fellow female police Detective, in blatant violation of MPD rules. \n863.  In 2013, Plaintiff Dickerson took the lieutenant’s promotional exam for the third time.  On \nboth previous tests, she was ranked promotable, but was passed over.  On this third attempt, she \nwas again ranked promotable.   \n864.  In July of 2014, she was promoted to Acting Lieutenant and transferred to the Second \nPolice District, and ultimately promoted to Lieutenant in October of 2014.   \n865.  Another detective sergeant, who did not perform as well as she had on the exam, was also \ndesignated as an Acting Lieutenant at the same time. However, he was allowed to remain in the \nCriminal Investigations Division, and was not transferred. \n866.  From March 30, 2018, until July 13, 2021, Plaintiff Dickerson was the only sworn female \npolice officer on MPD's executive staff.  She was also the highest-ranking Black woman officer at \nMPD. \n867.  Plaintiff Dickerson was assigned to Patrol Services South Bureau, which experienced the \nhighest level of violent crimes, particularly shootings and homicides.  \n868.  In 2018, 2019 and 2020, and during each year's end-of-year performance evaluation, \nPlaintiff Dickerson asked Chief Peter Newsham to be allowed to attend weekly homicide meetings \nand included in strategizing sessions to reduce homicides and violent crime city-wide.   \n120 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 121 of 208\n \n869.  Each  year,  Chief  Newsham  denied  Plaintiff  Dickerson’s  request,  leaving  Plaintiff \nDickerson out of the loop of critical information to combat crime and to execute her duties.  There \nwas no justification or excuse for excluding Plaintiff Dickerson from these important meetings. \n870.  In February of 2019, during an executive performance briefing, Plaintiff Dickerson noticed \na staggering disparity in serious discipline involving employees of color at MPD.  Plaintiff \nreiterated her concerns about disparities in serious discipline in February of 2020 and March of \n2021. \n871.  When Plaintiff Dickerson mentioned it to Chief Newsham, rather than take Plaintiff \nDickerson’s concerns seriously, Chief Newsham’s staff stopped sending Plaintiff Dickerson \ncalendar  invitations,  minutes  or  other  information  about  attending  disciplinary  committee \nmeetings. It is highly unlikely that the staff would make such a change without Chief Newsham’s \napproval.   \n872.  Thereafter, Chief Newsham frequently refused to answer Plaintiff Dickerson’s emails, text \nmessages, and phone calls.  As her direct supervisor, his refusal to engage with her materially \nhampered Plaintiff Dickerson’s ability to do her job. \n873.  Chief Newsham’s sabotage and disregard of Plaintiff Dickerson was retaliatory, designed \nto isolate Plaintiff Dickerson and keep her ignorant of information important to fulfilling her \nresponsibilities.  \n874.  On February 14, 2019, Plaintiff Dickerson had an emergency medical procedure that left \nher experiencing pain, headache, brain fog, and dizziness. \n875.  But instead of giving her the necessary time to recuperate, she was forced to return to work \nand give a presentation on or about February 21, 2019, even though she had a follow-up medical \nappointment for that day. \n121 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 122 of 208\n \n876.  Plaintiff Dickerson’s colleague, Assistant Chief Lamar Greene had agreed to present \nPlaintiff Dickerson’s information for her, but was not allowed to help her in that way.  Chief \nGreene and Plaintiff Dickerson were both Patrol Bureau Chiefs and had similar issues and \nconcerns.  Both were capable of making the presentation and had done so jointly in the past. \n877.  But Plaintiff Dickerson was subject to disparate and more harsh and taxing treatment than \nher colleague, for no discernibly legitimate reason.  \n878.  The pressure put on Plaintiff Dickerson to present when she was not feeling well was \ngratuitous and meant to send a negative message to her.  \n879.  In March of 2019,  Plaintiff Dickerson notified IAD Chief Manlapaz that she had evidence \nthat Commander Morgan Kane (hereinafter “Cdr. Kane”) was misclassifying or reassigning \nviolent crimes to avoid an increase in these crimes in the First Police District.   \n880.  This was a serious allegation of misconduct against a direct subordinate of Plaintiff \nDickerson’s, grounded in evidence. \n881.  In December 2019, Plaintiff Dickerson sent Assistant Chief Manlapaz a follow up email \nasking for an update or the outcome of the investigation.   \n882.  Despite compelling evidence, Plaintiff Dickerson was informed that the allegations were \nclassified as insufficient facts or unfounded.   \n883.  Plaintiff Dickerson expressed her confusion and displeasure with the outcome given the \nevidence provided to Chiefs Newsham and Manlapaz, but Plaintiff Dickerson never received \nclarification or an explanation for the result.   \n884.  Chiefs Newsham and Manlapaz undermined Plaintiff Dickerson’s authority by using their \npower to cover-up and excuse misconduct in Plaintiff Dickerson’s department.  \n122 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 123 of 208\n \n885.  After  that  incident,  executive  management,  including  Chief  Newsham  and \nCommunications Director Dustin Sternbeck  (hereinafter  “Mr. Sternbeck”) began to  exclude \nPlaintiff Dickerson from essential meetings.  Mr. Sternbeck would exclude Plaintiff Dickerson \nfrom press conferences about events that took place in her area of responsibility. \n886.  Chief  Newsham  denied  Plaintiff  Dickerson  important  and  desirable  training  and \ndevelopment opportunities that were given to all of her colleagues.  Plaintiff Dickerson’s picture \nwas even removed from the final version of the annual calendar, even though her picture was in \nthe draft that was disseminated. \n887.  For example, in December 2018 and October 2019, Plaintiff Dickerson asked Chief \nNewsham and his Chief of Staff, Matthew Bromeland, if she could attend the National Counter \nTerrorism Seminar in Israel.   \n888.  This training has been attended by police executives in major city police departments \nacross the country, and is valued because Israel is known for its strategies to combat terrorism and \ncommunity resilience practices.   \n889.  Plaintiff Dickerson was denied the opportunity to attend.  All of Plaintiff Dickerson’s male \ncolleagues, who wanted to attend were given the opportunity to go.   \n890.  In the Fall of 2019, Chief Newsham sent one of Plaintiff Dickerson’s male subordinates, \nCommander Randy Griffin (hereinafter “Cdr. Griffin”) to Israel.   \n891.  Commander Griffin informed Plaintiff Dickerson that during his visit, all other attendees \nwere Deputy/Assistant Chiefs or Chiefs of Police.  \n892.  Cdr. Griffin stressed that the training was phenomenal, and re-emphasized that he was the \nlowest ranking police official in attendance. \n123 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 124 of 208\n \n893.  There was no legitimate reason for Plaintiff Dickerson to have been denied the opportunity \nto attend the training in favor of a male subordinate.  The training was not even funded by MPD.  \nChief Newsham’s denial of this important training opportunity to Plaintiff Dickerson was an act \nof  disparate  treatment,  and  was  in  retaliation  for  her  complaints  about  misconduct  and \ndiscrimination within the MPD. \n894.  MPD executive management engaged in a pattern of negative actions and decisions against \nPlaintiff Dickerson in order to intimidate her and discourage her from complaining about and \naddressing both misconduct, and discrimination at the MPD.  \n895.  In July 2019, Plaintiff Dickerson attended a Strategic Crime briefing with Chief Newsham \nand one of her subordinates.   \n896.  During  the  briefing,  her  subordinate,  Captain  John  McDonald  (hereinafter  “Cpt. \nMcDonald”) made a disparaging remark about young black youth, comparing them to rats.  \n897.  Cpt. McDonald also used the term “on the hunt” while describing the Sixth District’s police \nefforts to reduce robberies, in a way that was dehumanizing and disrespectful of the community.  \n898.  Although Chief Newsham told the Cpt. McDonald that he shouldn’t refer the community \nthat way, no formal investigation was initiated, even though Plaintiff Dickerson informed Chief \nNewsham that she was offended by the remark, and concerned about Cpt. McDonald’s attitude \ntowards the DC Black community.   \n899.  Plaintiff Dickerson followed-up with Chief Newsham’s Chief Operating Officer, Leeann \nTurner, a week after the incident, and requested that Cpt. McDonald be transferred from her bureau \nand a formal investigation initiated into his comments and interactions with the Black community. \n124 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 125 of 208\n \n900.  Plaintiff Dickerson’s request was initially denied, and her concerns about Cpt. McDonald \nand his possible racial animus was ignored by Chief Newsham. But because of her persistence, an \ninvestigation was opened and substantiated, and Cpt. McDonald was demoted. \n901.  On or about January 4, 2020, the production company for investigative journalist Soledad \nO’Brien (hereinafter “Soledad Productions”) contacted MPD (Communications Department, PIO) \nto request an interview with Plaintiff Dickerson for an HBO documentary titled “Black and \nMissing.”  \n902.  MPD replied that Plaintiff Dickerson no longer worked in that area but would authorize \nthe current Commander, Ramey Kyle (hereinafter “Cdr. Kyle”) (white male) to handle the \ninterview.   \n903.  There were numerous emails exchanges between the executive producer and the PIO \ndirector.  Soledad Productions agreed to interview Cdr. Kyle, but stressed the importance of \nfeaturing Plaintiff Dickerson’s work as a black woman in the areas of missing persons and human \ntrafficking. \n904.  On or about January 24, 2020, MPD declined to participate in the documentary because of \nthe team’s persistence to interview Plaintiff Dickerson.   \n905.  On or about February 3, 2020, Plaintiff Dickerson met with Chief Newsham to discuss the \ndecision to decline the interview.  \n906.  He told Plaintiff Dickerson that it would be unfair to Cdr. Kyle if he allowed Plaintiff \nDickerson to participate in the interview, even though Plaintiff Dickerson had a unique perspective \nas a Black woman police officer.  \n907.  Chief Newsham agreed to allow Plaintiff Dickerson to participate after the executive \nproducer threatened to have Soledad O’Brien contact Mayor Bowser directly.   \n125 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 126 of 208\n \n908.  During the meeting, Chief Newsham told Plaintiff Dickerson that he didn’t understand why \ndoing this interview was so important to her, and he didn’t expect Plaintiff Dickerson to “make \ntrouble” for him.   \n909.  Of note, Cdr. Kyle was lower ranking than Plaintiff Dickerson, and Plaintiff Dickerson was \nso sharp and knowledgeable about human trafficking, that Chief Newsham had previously allowed \nher to conduct a human trafficking presentation in his stead at the International Assoc. of Chiefs \nof Police on his behalf.  \n910.  In another example of a petty, retaliatory act, MPD refused to sign a release to allow \nPlaintiff Dickerson to participate in Queen Latifah’s “Gloves Off” segment that featured one of \nPlaintiff Dickerson’s subordinate officers, Tiara Brown.   \n911.  MPD signed releases for other officers to be in the segment that highlighted a Black female \npolice officer (and Plaintiff Dickerson herein), but refused to allow the most senior Black woman \nin the Department to participate.  \n912.  In April 2021, Plaintiff Dickerson noticed during a crime briefing that her subordinate, \nCdr. Kane was, once again, attempting to misclassify crimes.   \n913.  MPD’s new Executive Assistant Chief, Ashan Benedict (hereinafter “EAC Benedict”) was \nin charge of the briefing. Cdr. Kane complained to EAC Benedict because Plaintiff Dickerson, \nCdr. Kane’s direct supervisor, told her to correct the crime report.   \n914.  On or about April 21, 2021, Plaintiff Dickerson forwarded to EAC Benedict the email from \nInternal Affairs about the history of Cdr. Kane and crime reports.   \n915.  Thereafter, the dialogue between Plaintiff Dickerson and EAC Benedict changed. EAC \nBenedict cancelled a one-on-one meeting with Plaintiff Dickerson and has stopped engaging her \ndirectly on several key issues. \n126 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 127 of 208\n \n916.  Since being made Chief, Plaintiff Dickerson has been treated disparately with respect to \nstaffing and resources than her white and male colleagues. \n917.  Plaintiff Dickerson has requested EAC Benedict to authorize a sergeant and administrative \nassistant for her new bureau, but was told that she would have to wait to fill her vacancies.  Those \nvacancies were filled on or about August 16, 2021. \n918.  Plaintiff Dickerson reiterated to EAC Benedict that she only had two employees on her \nteam, and that it was difficult to achieve department goals with minimal staffing.   \n919.  In sharp contrast, despite issues with her reporting accuracy and candor, Cdr. Kane was \npromoted to Assistant Chief of Police on or about July 14, 2021, to oversee a newly created bureau \nfor her, and was immediately given a staff assistant and sergeant. \n920.  In February of 2021, Plaintiff Dickerson raised concerns about Black women officers being \ndisciplined for recording their conversations with their supervisors and EEO.  Plaintiff Dickerson \nwas troubled because it was clear to her that Black women officers felt the need to record \nconversations because they were not being treated fairly.  \n921.  Plaintiff Dickerson also was concerned because the Black women officers were being \ndisciplined for something that was not a clear violation of police rules.   \n922.  Plaintiff Dickerson’s concerns fell on deaf ears and resulted in backlash and retaliation \nagainst her. \n923.  On or about July 27, 2021, there was an MPD executive retreat at the Wharf DC.   \n924.  During the retreat, Plaintiff Dickerson asked the group to consider whether MPD had an \nissue with systemic racism, real or perceived.   \n925.  EAC Benedict replied, in part, that people often “believe” that there is a systemic racism \nissue when it’s actually a “performance” issue.   \n127 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 128 of 208\n \n926.  EAC Benedict did not specify in whom the performance deficiency lay, nor did he seem \nparticularly interested in how real or perceived racism affected the people who believed they were \nbeing harmed by such treatment. \n927.  EAC Benedict did not speak or converse with Plaintiff Dickerson during the entire two- \nday retreat, but cordially interacted with Plaintiff Dickerson’s colleagues.  \n928.  As Patrol Chief for three years prior to  her  current  assignment, Plaintiff Dickerson \nfrequently interacted with, and had a good relationship with EAC Benedict, while he was at the \nBureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.  \n929.  She was therefore able to sense the chill in his interaction with her when she started to raise \nconcerns about racism at MPD. \n930.  Chief Newsham often dismissed Plaintiff Dickerson’s presence in rooms filled with her \nsubordinates or community members.   \n931.  Chief Newsham, Commander Andre Wright, and  Plaintiff Dickerson were in front of the \ngroup offering congratulatory remarks.  On each occasion, Chief Newsham offered remarks and \ndeferred to Commander Wright after he finished speaking.  Commander Wright immediately \nintroduced me and allowed me to address the audience before him.  Commander Wright was \nfollowing the rank structure that Chief Newsham blatantly ignored.  \n932.  On or about January 1, 2021, Plaintiff Dickerson was the third in command of the \nMetropolitan Police Department.  On or about January 2, 2021, Mayor Muriel Bowser swore in \nChief Robert J. Contee III as the acting chief of police for the department.   \n933.  Prior  to  his  appointment,  Chief  Contee  was  the  Assistant  Chief  of  Police  of  the \nInvestigative Services Bureau (ISB).  Plaintiff Dickerson has vast knowledge and experience in \nsupervising and managing criminal and administrative investigations.  Chief Contee promoted a \n128 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 129 of 208\n \nwhite male subordinate to Assistant Chief to oversee ISB.  Plaintiff Dickerson was not offered, or \neven considered for this position. \n934.  In March of 2021, the second in command, Asst. Chief Greene, announced that he would \nbe retiring from the department in May of 2021.  On April 2, 2021, Chief Contee hired EAC \nBenedict, a retired officer from a completely different administration, to be second in command.  \n935.  Despite Plaintiff Dickerson’s education, knowledge, familiarity with the city and citizens \nof DC, and long tenure on the MPD, she was not offered, or even considered for the EAC position. \n936.  On or about May 7, 2021, Plaintiff Dickerson was reassigned from being a three-star \nAssistant Chief to a two-star Assistant Chief, and was downgraded from third in command to eight \nin command, below all the male executive sworn officers.   \n937.  Plaintiff Dickerson was assigned to lead the Youth and Family Engagement Bureau.  She \nwent from having an assigned seat and voice in the MPD weekly Monday & Thursday meetings, \nto not being included in any crime fighting strategies.   \n938.  Chief ContPlee informed Plaintiff Dickerson in July of 2020, (as peers) that she was the \n“conscience of the department,” and he openly wondered what would happen to MPD when \nPlaintiff Dickerson left.  He further complemented Plaintiff Dickerson for having the courage to \nalways say what needs to be said. \n939.  Plaintiff asserts that her functional demotion, lack of training opportunities, lack of proper \nresourcing,  marginalization  and  undermining  are  the  result  of  her  efforts  to  report  police \nmisconduct, and her efforts to oppose racism and sexism in MPD. \n \n \n \n129 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 130 of 208\n \nPlaintiff Dickerson’s Individual Causes of Action \n  Race Discrimination and Retaliation Claims \n940.  Plaintiff Dickerson incorporates and restates all of the previous factual allegations \ncontained in this Complaint as if fully restated herein. \n941.  Plaintiff Dickerson, on her own behalf, asserts herein claims pursuant to Title VII of the \nCivil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e, et seq.;  the District of Columbia Human \nRights Act, District of Columbia Code § 2-1401.01 et seq., and the Civil Rights Act of 1866 \nDiscrimination Based on Race in the Making and Enforcing of Contracts 42 U.S.C. §1981(a) by \nway of, through and via 42 U.S.C. § 1983. \n942.  Plaintiff Dickerson was treated disparately, subjected to a hostile work environment and \nretaliated against for complaining about and opposing the race discrimination to which she was \nsubjected.  \n943.  The facts alleged above, if proven, constitute discrimination, and systematic retaliation \nsevere and pervasive enough to be compensable. \n944.  The facts alleged above, taken in conjunction with the facts alleged by the other nine (9) \nCRPs, establish that Defendant maintained a pattern and practice of race discrimination against \nBlack women police officers on the basis of race.  \n945.  The facts alleged by Plaintiff Dickerson that establish that she was treated disparately than \nher non-Black-female colleagues, are typical of, and consistent with, the claims of the other nine \n(9) CRPs. \n946.  As a direct and proximate cause of the hostile work environment fostered by Defendant, \nPlaintiff Dickerson was humiliated, embarrassed and made to endure constant stress and anxiety, \ndepression, lack of sleep and other symptoms that caused her severe mental anguish.   \n130 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 131 of 208\n \n947.  Plaintiff  Dickerson  has  incurred  lost  wages,  loss  of  reputation  and  loss  of  career \nopportunity now and into the future, and all the other losses stated herein. \n948.  Plaintiff Dickerson seeks compensatory, and damages for mental pain and suffering, above \nand beyond recovery as a member of the class, of not less than $250,000.00, plus interest, costs, \nfees and all other remedies the Court deems appropriate.  \n    Sex Discrimination and Retaliation Claims \n949.

Plaintiff Dickerson was treated disparately, subjected to a hostile work environment and \nretaliated against for complaining about and opposing the gender discrimination she to which she \nwas subjected.  \n952.  The facts alleged above, if proven, constitute discrimination, and systematic retaliation \nsevere and pervasive enough to be compensable. \n953.  The facts alleged above, taken in conjunction with the facts alleged by the other nine (9) \nCRPs, establish that Defendant maintained a pattern and practice of race discrimination against \nBlack women police officers on the basis of sex.  \n954.

Plaintiff Grier was first employed by MPD in February  of 1989. The Plaintiff Grier retired \nin March of 2015, and was asked to rejoin the department in November of 2017. \n967.  Her first assignment upon her return to MPD, was in the Police Academy, where her duties \nincluded, preparing civilians, via her knowledge, and skills, and MPD general orders and special \norders, to be the best law enforcement officers, to the best of her abilities.   \n133 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 134 of 208\n \n968.  In her department there were two offices spaces, for instructors, one was all male officers \nand the other was all female officers.   \n969.  A civilian manager named Jessica Bress (hereinafter “Ms. Bress”) (white female), who was \nnot part of Plaintiff Grier’s supervisory chain of command, was allowed to assign Plaintiff Grier \nto the office that only had male officers as an \"experiment\" or \"special project.\"  \n970.  The assignment caused Plaintiff Grier to be isolated in a work environment that was male \ndominated and jocular, where inappropriate and disrespectful language towards women was used \nregularly. \n971.  Moreover, the male officers in the department were managed in a way that allowed them \nto act as if no female officer was present.   \n972.  For example, one of the male officers, Bray Jones (hereinafter “Officer Jones”), would \nregularly  undress  down  to  his  underwear  in  front  of  Plaintiff  Grier,  which  was  extremely \ninappropriate and done to shock Plaintiff Grier and make her feel uncomfortable.  \n973.  Officer Jones’ provoking and inappropriate behavior happened often enough that on or \nabout November 2020, the Plaintiff Grier, sought the intervention of the departmental Lieutenant, \nArthur Davis (hereinafter “Lt. Davis”). \n974.  The Plaintiff Grier asked if she could speak privately with Lt. Davis about the fact that \nOfficer Jones would undress in front of her.  Ultimately, Lt. Davis took no action whatsoever, \nasserting that what Officer Jones was doing by undressing in front of Plaintiff Grier when he could \neasily have done so privately, was tolerable and acceptable because Officer Jones “wasn’t trying \nto be deliberately offensive.”  \n975.  Plaintiff Grier repeatedly asked Lt. Davis and  to either be transferred out of the office \nspace, or for another female officer to be assigned to the office to change the dynamics.  \n134 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 135 of 208\n \n976.  Plaintiff Grier’s requests were repeatedly ignored.  \n977.  Instead, Plaintiff Grier was forced to continue working in an office that was a bastion of \n\"locker-room talk\" and inappropriate language, and was treated as if she did not exist. \n978.  In the early months of 2002, Plaintiff Grier arrested and testified against a fellow police \nOfficer, Jay Effler (hereinafter “Officer Effler”), who was operating his police cruiser while \nintoxicated.  \n979.  Plaintiff Grier had no choice but to make the arrest because the Officer Effler was observed \ndriving erratically by a witness who called 911.   \n980.  Plaintiff Grier’s fellow officers were so incensed about her “snitching,” that the refused to \nprovide her back up on the job.  \n981.  For example, one night Plaintiff Grier was trailing a stolen vehicle.  Normally, in such \ncases, other officers arrive to assist without having to be called. That night, Plaintiff called several \ntimes for back up, and no officers came.  \n982.  The dispatcher continued to call for back up units (assistance), at which time, Plaintiff \nGrier’s (then) spouse (Retired Detective Lowell Grier), who was the Youth Division Watch \nCommander for that evening, responded from his office to provide his wife back-up in a dangerous \nsituation.  \n983.  For duration of the incident, no other officers arrived to provide back-up, and management \ndid not discipline anyone for this breach of procedure and protocol. There were several other \nincidents in which officers failed to provide back-up to Plaintiff, which put her at risk. \n984.   Plaintiff Grier went to court to testify against Officer Effler, her recruiting class colleague, \nwhich she was legally required to do.  But because it did not sit well with her colleagues, they \nshunned her.  \n135 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 136 of 208\n \n985.  Officer Effler was ultimately diverted, and the case was resolved without further charges, \nbut this outcome did ameliorate the retaliation against Plaintiff Grier. She was forced to be \ntransferred to day shift for her own safety and wellbeing.  \n986.  From that point on, Plaintiff Grier was treated as a pariah, isolated and disrespected by \nmanagement and by fellow officers. The Plaintiff Grier was advised by a fellow officer, to “Watch \nyour Back!” after responding in after the incident with the intoxicated officer.  \n987.  MPD management was aware of what the other officers were doing to Plaintiff Grier, and \nchose to do nothing to change or correct their retaliatory behavior. \n988.  Plaintiff  Grier  was  discriminated  against  and  treated  more  harshly  than  her  male \ncounterparts and fellow officers in many ways. \n989.  For example, while at the Police Academy, although all of the officers were supposed to \ntake turns doing details in the field when it was needed, Plaintiff Grier was the only officer to be \nassigned to every detail.   \n990.  Detail into the field is often viewed as less desirable duty because it requires the officer to \nchange routine, enter into a community with which they might not be familiar, and involves more \nrisk.  \n991.  Nevertheless, every officer is supposed to assist with special details,  from time to time, it \nassists them in remaining sharp, and to back up and augment forces when needed.   \n992.  Plaintiff  Grier  repeatedly  complained  to  her  superiors,  including  to  the  Department \nCommander Ralph Ennis (hereinafter “Cdr. Ennis”)(white male), about the fact that she was being \nsingled out to be assigned to every single detail, but Cdr. Ennis ignored her complaints.   \n993.  Worse, Cdr. Ennis was actively complicit in the disparate treatment.  \n136 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 137 of 208\n \n994.  On more than one occasion, especially during the holidays,  he went to so far as to find a \nsubstitute instructor for Plaintiff Grier’s academy class cohort so that he could send Plaintiff Grier \nto the field, rather than sending the substitute person to the field instead.  \n995.  Cdr. Ennis’ confusing choice caused  Plaintiff Grier’s class to lose valuable training \ninformation. \n996.   Cdr. Ennis chose to, unnecessarily and counter-productively, send Plaintiff Grier into the \nfield, to make it clear to that her complaints did not matter, and would only bring upon her more \nunfair treatment.  \n997.  In  2020,  during  the  raging  COVID-19  pandemic,  Plaintiff  Grier  was  again  treated \ndifferently and more harshly than her peers. \n998.  All of Plaintiff Grier’s colleagues were allowed to work from home and conduct business \nover zoom during the pandemic. \n999.  Plaintiff Grier, however, was not permitted to do so.    \n1000.  Plaintiff Grier’s colleagues worked from home for weeks without incident, while she was \nstill required to come in to work.   \n1001.  As soon as Plaintiff Grier actually tried to work from home, the departmental management \nchanged the work from home policy altogether.  \n1002.  This  was  not  mere  coincidence.   The  Acting  Sgt.,  Sarah  Snapko  (hereinafter  “Ofc. \nSnapko”)(white female) stated that by attempting to work from home as all the other officers were \npermitted to do, Plaintiff Grier had \"messed it up for everyone.\"   \n1003.  A/Sgt. Snapko was acting under the direction of Ms. Bress and Cdr. Ennis.  \n1004.  Plaintiff Grier was never given an explanation as to why her working from home would be \na problem, when it was fine for all the other officers.  \n137 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 138 of 208\n \n1005.  Plaintiff Grier was so dejected from the hostile and discriminatory work environment she \nwas exposed to, she opted to retire, rather than continue working at MPD. \n1006.  When she retired in March of 2021, she asked to be made a Reserve Official (which is an \nunpaid position) to be able to continue assisting in the Reserve Officer program, because there was \nno female leadership in the Reserve Program.  \n1007.  Plaintiff Grier was aware of the statistical disparities in the ability to women to get through \ntraining successfully, and wanted to continue helping the next generation of female officers.  \n1008.  On several occasions, Plaintiff Grier received feedback that her presence was helpful to \nfemale trainees.   \n1009.  Plaintiff Grier was rejected for this volunteer position because several male officers did \nnot want to work with her.   \n1010.  MPD, again, chose to place the sexist and discriminatory preferences, and petty desires for \nrevenge of male officers, over the training needs of female trainees for female leadership and \nsupport in becoming police officers. \nPlaintiff Grier’s Individual Causes of Action \n  Race Discrimination and Retaliation Claims \n1011.

Plaintiff Grier incorporates and restates all information and allegations contained in the \npreceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n1030.  Pursuant to the District of Columbia Whistleblower Protection Act D.C. Code § 1-615-51 \net seq., Defendants are prohibited from reassigning, terminating or otherwise retaliating against a \nD.C. government employee as a result of that employee’s protected disclosures that the employee \nreasonably believes show gross mismanagement, gross misuse or waste of government resources, \nand abuse of authority in the connection with the administration of a government program, or a \nviolation of a state, local or federal law, rule or regulation.  \n1031.  Plaintiff Grier was an employee who, as a result of her disclosures to her supervisors, the \nsenior leadership of her department, the EEO Department of the MPD, Assistant Chief Caron, \nChief Newsham, the District of Columbia City Council, the Office of the Mayor and the EEOC \nabout the systemic discrimination in the MPD, and the complicity of the MPD EEO Department \nin perpetuating it and protecting those who engage in it, ethical violations that included leaking \nconfidential  witness  statements,  the  creation  of  a  chilling  and  retaliatory  work  culture  that \ndiscouraged officers from complaining about mistreatment and inappropriate police conduct, \nenjoyed the protection of DCWPA.  \n1032.  As a direct result of Plaintiff Grier protected disclosures, Defendants systematically and \ncontinuously retaliated against Plaintiff, including but not limited to unwarranted disciplinary \nactions against Plaintiff, isolation and separation from coworkers, unfavorable treatment and \nassignments, false and inaccurate performance evaluation and ultimately termination. \n141 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 142 of 208\n \n1033.

Plaintiff Hampton first join the MPD in December of 2003.  Her first duty assignment was \nas a patrol officer in the 7th District. \n1038.  She remained in that role and in that District for seventeen (17) years. \n1039.  Plaintiff Hampton was often detailed to Community Outreach because she was passionate \nabout helping the community that she grew up in, and helping to bridge the gap between the \ncommunity and MPD. \n1040.  On Plaintiff’s third day at the 7th District, she was sexually harassed by Sergeant Andre \nSuber (hereinafter “Sgt. Suber”), who was one of her immediate supervisors. \n1041.  Sgt. Suber wanted to take Plaintiff Hampton out on a date, and since she was so new on \nthe job she told him she was engaged rather than just rebuffing his advances. \n1042.  Plaintiff Hampton was concerned about angering him.   \n142 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 143 of 208\n \n1043.  Sgt. Suber indicated that he did not care if Plaintiff Hampton was engaged, he wanted to \ndate her anyway.   \n1044.  He further told Plaintiff Hampton that he could make her life miserable. \n1045.  Despite the fact that she was new to the force, Plaintiff Hampton reported the sexual \nharassment to her training officer, Anthony Ruchak (hereinafter “Officer Ruchak”), who was \noffended on her behalf and took Plaintiff Hampton immediately to the Union Steward, Officer \nChristopher Bauman (hereinafter “Union Steward Bauman”).  \n1046.  Union Steward Bauman filed an internal EEO complaint on Plaintiff Hampton’s behalf, \nbut the EEO Office decided that there was insufficient evidence and said the claim was unfounded. \n1047.  Union Steward Bauman also filed a complaint with DC OHR.  That claim was also \ninvestigated, and went to mediation.  \n1048.  At the mediation, it was resolved that Sgt. Suber would no longer be able to supervise \nPlaintiff Hampton for the remainder of her MPD career. \n1049.  Sgt. Suber was not disciplined in any other way. \n1050.  Plaintiff Hampton eventually processed what happened, and was able to carry on with her \ncareer. \n1051.  In October of 2007, Plaintiff Hampton started to be harassed by some young men in the \ncommunity, in front of her home.  \n1052.  They singled her out for intimidation and attacked because she was a police officer living \nin the community, and because she was female. \n1053.  Plaintiff Hampton went to her MPD chain of command to seek assistance and help with \nthe situation, but did not receive the kind of concern or response she expected. \n143 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 144 of 208\n \n1054.  At one point, an MPD Detective Mary Bonaccorsy (hereinafter “Det. Bonaccorsy”) went \nto Plaintiff Hampton’s house to conduct a threat assessment. \n1055.  Det. Bonaccorsy concluded that the harassment was Plaintiff Hampton’s fault because she \nshould have lived in such a dangerous community.  \n1056.  Unfortunately, the harassment escalated, and eventually Plaintiff Hampton went to the \nlocal news to get community support in ending the harassment. \n1057.  MPD leaders were unhappy with Plaintiff Hampton for taking the situation public, and \nrather than providing back-up or support, MPD attempted to silence her and insisted that she cease \ngoing on the news. \n1058.  A few MPD officers came to Plaintiff Hampton’s home to give her back-up against the \nharassment, but they ultimately were disciplined for doing so.  \n1059.  Plaintiff Hampton felt as if MPD management was doing all it could to prevent her from \ngetting assistance with a dangerous situation, and did not have her back.  \n1060.  At work, the retaliation  against Plaintiff Hampton  escalated.  Her work was hyper-\nscrutinized. She was isolated and lost the camaraderie of her peers.  And word was put out that she \nwas on management’s target list. \n1061.  Plaintiff  Hampton  filed  a  DOJ  complaint  against  Asst.  Chief  Dianne  Grooms  for \nretaliation. \n1062.  DOJ kicked the investigation back to MPD, to be handled by Chief Lanier.  Chief Lanier \nhanded the investigation to IAD, which in turn concluded that the claim was not substantiated. \n1063.  It is worth noting that virtually every officer at MPD knew that Plaintiff was disfavored by \nmanagement, but somehow IAD could find no evidence to substantiate the claim. \n144 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 145 of 208\n \n1064.  In January of 2011, Plaintiff was called to a domestic abuse situation in which the man was \nbeating his partner, and Plaintiff ended up having to shoot the man. \n1065.  The girlfriend who was being abused was called by MPD IAD at the shooting review board, \nand IAD was attempting to make the case that Plaintiff Hampton was in the wrong. \n1066.  However, the Union attorney, Pressler & Associates, made a request for records to the \nprosecutor’s office, and received two witness statements that corroborated that Plaintiff was \njustified in the shooting. \n1067.  Additionally, Plaintiff Hampton and her partner Kimberly Sillah (hereinafter “Officer \nSillah”) had thirteen (13) veteran officers testify on their behalf. \n1068.  Even the man who was shot by Plaintiff Hampton and Offier Sillah, apologized to them.  \n1069.  And in fact, IAD was chastised by the tribunal for its shoddy investigation.  \n1070.  Both officers involved in the incident were cleared by a unanimous decision of the tribunal, \nand both received an apology from the tribunal for having been put through such an ordeal.  \n1071.  Plaintiff Hampton never received an explanation as to why IAD had not bother to obtain \nthe critical witness statements.  \n1072.  In  2018, Plaintiff lost her father unexpectedly.  The loss was devastating to Plaintiff and \nher family.  In a moment of extreme grief, she broke down while at work.   \n1073.  Sgt. Delroy Burton (hereinafter “Sgt. Burton”), was considered a friend by Plaintiff \nHampton, and was there when she became emotional.  He hugged her, but then used the moment \nto try to kiss her, which Plaintiff Hampton rebuffed.  She was both confused and hurt by his attempt \nsexual advance. \n1074.  Plaintiff Hampton was too scared to report Sgt. Burton because he was a top leader in the \nUnion, and powerful throughout the MPD. Nevertheless, he retaliated against her. \n145 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 146 of 208\n \n1075.  Although Sgt. Burton did not have the authority to discipline Plaintiff Hampton, he did \nhave the reach and power to sully her name, and turn people against her, which he did. \n1076.  In April of 2019, Plaintiff was asked and approved to participated in a recruiting event for \nMPD by Commander Andre Wright (hereinafter “Cdr. Wright”). \n1077.  However,  Lieutenant  Peter  Larsen  (hereinafter  “Lt.  Larsen”),  who  was  the  Watch \nCommander, insisted that Plaintiff Hampton prove that she was authorized to participate in the \nevent.  \n1078.  Plaintiff Hampton had to forward the email from Cdr. Wright approving her participation \nto Lt. Larsen, and even did not satisfy him.  He demanded that the Recruiting Sergeant verbally \nconfirm to him that Plaintiff Hampton had proper authority to be at the event.  \n1079.  Lt. Larsen had no reason or justification for making Plaintiff Hampton jump through those \nhoops.  \n1080.  Plaintiff Hampton had to call Cdr. Wright, who then sent out another email, essentially \nclarifying that he said what he said. \n1081.  In June of 2019, Plaintiff Hampton was on patrol and flagged down by a resident, and \nsimultaneously received a call on the radio to serve a protection order. \n1082.  Because  Plaintiff  Hampton  was  detained  speaking  with  the  resident,  she  didn’t \nimmediately answer the radio call. \n1083.  At which point Captain James Boteler (hereinafter “Cpt. Boteler”) demanded that Plaintiff \nHampton call him, and berated her for not responding to the radio fast enough. \n1084.  Cpt. Boteler then sent Sergeant Jonathan Podorski (hereinafter “Sgt. Podorski”) to meet \nPlaintiff Hampton in the field and monitor her to ensure she was responding to the radio. \n146 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 147 of 208\n \n1085.  When asked, Sgt. Podorski confirmed that Plaintiff Hampton was the only officer Cpt. \nBoteler treated in such a condescending and micromanaging fashion.  \n1086.  In June of 2019, Plaintiff Hampton discovered that she had been involuntarily detailed to \nthe Teletype Unit, and that her days off would be changed to Monday and Tuesday, which was \nhighly irregular. \n1087.  The Teletype Unit Supervisor informed Plaintiff Hampton that the change in her days off \nwas specifically directed by Cpt. Boetler. \n1088.  Plaintiff Hampton felt as if she had no choice but to file and internal EEO complaint \nagainst Cpt. Boteler for targeting her for mistreatment and retaliation. \n1089.  Plaintiff met with EEO Counselor Doreen Haines, who initiated an investigation, but \nPlaintiff Hampton’s claim was unsubstantiated. \n1090.  In May of 2021, Plaintiff Hampton was promoted to Sergeant. \n1091.  In August of 2021, Lieutenant Michael Daee (hereinafter “Lt. Daee”) intentionally \nundermined Plaintiff Hampton’s authority when he intervened to protect a white male officer \nwho had been blatantly disrespectful and insubordinate to Plaintiff Hampton. \n1092.  The officer defied her order on the radio where all officers could hear the exchange. \n1093.  When Plaintiff Hampton attempted to write up the insubordination, Lt. Daee undermined \nher, and made it all but impossible for Plaintiff Hampton to properly do her job. \n1094.  Lt. Daee did not engage in that kind of heavy-handed intervention, with respect to other \nSergeants. \n1095.  Lt. Daee further undermined Plaintiff Hampton, by usurping a key authority from her, \nand making her obtain his approval before exercising her discretion.  Again, this was disparate \ntreatment based on Plaintiff Hampton’s race and gender. \n147 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 148 of 208\n \n1096.  On or about September 8, 2021, Lt. Daee targeted Plaintiff Hampton for an investigation \nof a shooting that took place on the shift after her shift was completed, rather the Sergeant who \nwas on duty when the shooting occurred. \n1097.  Lt. Daee didn’t just unfairly target Plaintiff Hampton, but also went out of his way to \ninvolve his peers and other managers in the targeting of Plaintiff Hampton. \n1098.  Lt. Daee insisted that Plaintiff Hampton attend a recertification training for the Civil \nDisturbance Unit, even though Plaintiff Hampton had never received the certificate in the first \nplace, and did not have underlying knowledge or equipment for the recertification training to be \nof any value. \n1099.  On or about September 14, 2021, Plaintiff Hampton went to the scene of a shooting, but \ndue to a lack of available cruisers, had to get a ride with a fellow Sergeant.   \n1100.  The scene was somewhat volatile, and Plaintiff Hampton had to work to keep the crowd \nunder control. \n1101.  While she was doing that, the Officer who had given her a ride, Sergeant Dale Vernick \n(hereinafter “Sgt. Vernick”) (white male), got back in the cruiser and left her on the scene. \n1102.  Plaintiff Hampton had left her personal belongings in the cruiser, and had to raise Sgt. \nVernick and tried to raise him on the radio three times.  He refused to respond to her. \n1103.  Another sergeant (Black male) raised Sgt. Vernick on his cell phone, and he answered \nright away. \n1104.  Sgt. Vernick returned to the station so Plaintiff Hampton could get her things.  When he \ngot there, he refused to speak to her or acknowledge that he left her at the scene of a crime. \n1105.  This was the first time in Plaintiff’ Hampton’s career that she was left behind by someone \nshe was riding with.  \n148 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 149 of 208\n \n1106.  MPD management took no disciplinary action whatsoever against Sgt. Vernick. The \nLieutenant in charge at the time, Lieutenant Jonathan Fleming (hereinafter Lt. Fleming), made \nexcuses for Sgt. Vernick’s behavior, and took no action to address the risk situation in which he \nleft Plaintiff Hampton. \n1107.  This act of contempt and disrespect was noticed by all the officers that were on the scene \nand listening to the radio.   \n              Plaintiff Hampton’s Individual Causes of action \n       Race Discrimination and Retaliation Claims \n1108.

Plaintiff Grier incorporates and restates all information and allegations contained in the \npreceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n1127.  Pursuant to the District of Columbia Whistleblower Protection Act D.C. Code § 1-615-51 \net seq., Defendants are prohibited from reassigning, terminating or otherwise retaliating against a \nD.C. government employee as a result of that employee’s protected disclosures that the employee \nreasonably believes show gross mismanagement, gross misuse or waste of government resources, \nand abuse of authority in the connection with the administration of a government program, or a \nviolation of a state, local or federal law, rule or regulation.  \n151 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 152 of 208\n \n1128.  Plaintiff Grier was an employee who, as a result of her disclosures to her supervisors, the \nsenior leadership of her department, the EEO Department of the MPD, Assistant Chief Caron, \nChief Newsham, the District of Columbia City Council, the Office of the Mayor and the EEOC \nabout the systemic discrimination in the MPD, and the complicity of the MPD EEO Department \nin perpetuating it and protecting those who engage in it, ethical violations that included leaking \nconfidential  witness  statements,  the  creation  of  a  chilling  and  retaliatory  work  culture  that \ndiscouraged officers from complaining about mistreatment and inappropriate police conduct, \nenjoyed the protection of DCWPA.  \n1129.  As a direct result of Plaintiff Grier protected disclosures, Defendants systematically and \ncontinuously retaliated against Plaintiff, including but not limited to unwarranted disciplinary \nactions against Plaintiff, isolation and separation from coworkers, unfavorable treatment and \nassignments, false and inaccurate performance evaluation and ultimately termination. \n1130.  As a result of Defendants’ actions, Plaintiff Grier suffered significant economic harm in \nthe form lost salary, loss of employment opportunities, damage to her professional reputation, and \nsignificant mental and emotional distress. \n1131.  Plaintiff Grier was humiliated, embarrassed and made to  endure constant stress and \nanxiety, depression, lack of sleep and other symptoms that caused her severe mental anguish. \n1132.  Plaintiff Grier has incurred lost wages, loss of reputation and loss of career opportunity \nnow and into the future, and all the other losses stated herein. \n1133.  Plaintiff Grier herein seeks compensatory damages, and damages for mental pain and \nsuffering of not less than $500,000.00, plus interest, costs, fees, and all other remedies the Court \ndeems appropriate. \n1134.   \n152 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 153 of 208\n \n          PLAINTIFF KNIGHT’S INDIVIDUAL CLAIMS \n      Facts Relevant to Plaintiff Knight’s Individual Claims \n1135.  Plaintiff Knight began her employment with the MPD in 1989, when she was hired for a \ncivilian position.  In 1  991, she transferred to a sworn officer position and was assigned to the 4th \nDistrict.  \n1136.  While Plaintiff Knight was still a rookie and in training, Sgt. Braum Persaud (hereinafter \n“Sgt. Persaud”) began sexually harassing her by making inappropriate and suggestive comments. \n1137.  Plaintiff Knight complained of Sgt. Persaud’s inappropriate, intimidating and unwanted \nadvances to her supervisor, but nothing was done. \n1138.  Eventually, Sgt. Persaud went so far to call Plaintiff Knight’s grandmother’s house on \nPlaintiff’s day off. When Plaintiff Knight returned the call, which was very unusual, Sgt. Persaud \nasked her to meet him for a sexual assignation. When Plaintiff Knight refused, and explained that \nshe was married, Sgt. Persaud’s demeanor towards Plaintiff completely changed.  \n1139.  Sgt. Persaud retaliated against Plaintiff Knight for refusing his advances by giving her very \nundesirable assignments, such as a walking beat that was only one block long, and forbade other \nofficers from helping or relieving Plaintiff Knight, making it clear to Plaintiff Knight, and to \neveryone else on the team that she was his target, and that no one was to help her.  \n1140.  At times, Sgt. Persaud’s retaliation and mistreatment of Plaintiff Knight left her with no \nback-up or assistance in parts of the city with active gang violence, which put her personal safety \nat risk. \n1141.  In 1993, Plaintiff Knight again informed her superior Commander Bill Sarvis (hereinafter \n“Cdr. Sarvis”) that she was being sexually harassed and retaliated against by Sgt. Persaud. Instead \n153 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 154 of 208\n \nof investigating or disciplining Sgt. Persaud, Defendant made Plaintiff Knight switch Districts \nwith another female officer, Carolyn Battle, and moved Plaintiff Knight to the First District. \n1142.  On Plaintiff Knight’s first day in her new district, Captain Michael Razalowski (hereinafter \n“Capt. Razalowski”), the leader of the First District substation called Plaintiff Knight into his \noffice and proceeded to scream and curse at her, calling her a “trouble-maker.” \n1143.  From that day on, the First District Station Sergeants, Phillip Parker (hereinafter “Sgt. \nParker”) and Richard Gets  (hereinafter “Sgt.  Gets”), harassed,  attacked, bullied, demeaned, \nisolated and undermined Plaintiff on a near-daily basis. \n1144.  The systematic, and management-approved retaliation against Plaintiff continued unabated \nuntil Cpt. Razalowski was replaced by Captain Charles Fonville (hereinafter “Cpt. Fonville”).   \nCpt. Fonville put a stop to the harassment and retaliation, but he did not discipline the Sgts  who \nhad engaged in it. \n1145.  Plaintiff Knight received a phone call from Cpt. Fonville informing her that Sgt. Persaud \nmade Lieutenant and was transferred to the First District sub-station, over Plaintiff Knight.  Cpt. \nFonville told Plaintiff Knight not to worry, that if anything inappropriate happened, she should \nimmediately him.  But a few months later, Cpt. Fonville was promoted and transferred, and the \nbullying continued.  \n1146.  In 1997 Plaintiff Knight became pregnant with twins.  Lt. Persaud told her that she wasn’t \nallowed to sit in the station “looking like that” and made her sit the break room.   \n1147.  Per MPD policy at the time, Plaintiff Knight was required to make routine visits to the \nPolice and Fire Clinic because she was on limited duty.  There was a steep hill between the parking \nlot and the clinic.  Plaintiff Knight asked Lt. Persaud if she could get a ride to the clinic to avoid \n154 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 155 of 208\n \nwalking up the steep hill, but he refused her request, while he granted rides to other non-Black \nwomen who went to the clinic. \n1148.  The combination of the stress of being bullied at work, and the strain of repeatedly walking \nup the steep hill while carrying twins proved to be very detrimental to Plaintiff Knight’s pregnancy.  \nShe went into premature labor, and lost both of the twins.  \n1149.  Plaintiff Knight remained in the Fist District until 1997, when she was swapped out with \nanother officer from the Fifth District. \n1150.  In 2001, Plaintiff Knight was again transferred, this time to the training academy as an \ninstructor.  Her direct supervisor was Mr. Larry Edwards (hereinafter “Mr. Edwards”) and \nSergeant Darryl Price (hereinafter “Sgt. Price”).   \n1151.  Mr. Edwards rarely spoke to the Black officers in his sections.  He would wait until the \nofficer walked away from their workstation and would communicate through sticky notes that he \nplaced on their computers.  \n1152.  Mr. Edwards had no problem communicating with the white officers face-to-face.  Mr. \nEdwards would often send the white officers to trainings and conferences, while not informing \nSgt. Price or the black officers.  The black officers raised the issue with Sgt. Price, and he spoke \nto Mr. Edwards about it, but the disparate treatment was not escalated, and no disciplinary action \nwas taken. \n1153.  Sgt. Price was transferred to the Assistant Chief’s Office, and shortly thereafter, the three \nBlack  officers  who  worked  under  Mr.  Edwards  were  involuntarily  transferred  to  different \nassignments within the academy. \n1154.  Plaintiff  Knight  was  assigned  to  work  under  Mr.  Byron  Williams  (hereinafter  “Mr. \nWilliams”) and Sergeant Kimberly Butler (hereinafter “Sgt. Butler.”)  During a staff meeting, Sgt. \n155 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 156 of 208\n \nButler informed Plaintiff Knight that there was a rumor that she was having an affair with Mr. \nWilliams.  Plaintiff became very upset, strenuously denying the rumor.  \n1155.  Nevertheless,  the  false  rumor  persisted,  and  when  Plaintiff  attempted  to  report  Mr. \nWilliams for grabbing her put, which he did while smiling at her, her complaint was not taken \nseriously because the Commander she reported the sexual assault to, assumed the rumor was true.  \n1156.  Although the Commander claimed she would “look into it,” no action was taken, and \nPlaintiff never heard another thing about it.  Mr. Williams was eventually terminated. \n1157.  In 2009, Plaintiff Knight was transferred to the District 5 administrative office with \nSergeant Randy Griffin (hereinafter “Sgt. Griffin”).  \n1158.  Sgt. Griffin was not happy with Plaintiff Knight being assigned under him because he felt \nan officer who was working well in the roll was moved out of admin to make room for Plaintiff \nKnight.  \n1159.  Sgt.  Griffin  was  thus  hostile  and  unprofessional  towards  Plaintiff  Knight  from  the \nbeginning of her assignment.  \n1160.  Sgt. Griffin wrote-up Plaintiff Knight for three separate disciplinary infractions, and rather \nthan provide them to her in a professional manner, he placed them in her jacket.   \n1161.  When Plaintiff Knight discovered them, she went directly to the department Captain to \naddress the situation.  \n1162.  The department Captain, Lewis Douglas, removed the disciplinary actions.  No action or \ndiscipline was taken against Sgt. Griffin for abuse of his power and fraudulent disciplinary actions.  \n1163.  To further retaliate against and bully Plaintiff Knight, Sgt. Griffin ordered Plaintiff Knight \nto report to the Police and Fire Clinic for a fitness for duty evaluation. Sgt. Griffin claimed that the \n156 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 157 of 208\n \nbasis for the referral was that Plaintiff had informed him that she was “depressed.”  Plaintiff Knight \nhad not done so.  \n1164.  Plaintiff Knight complained to the department commander that what Sgt. Griffin had done \nwas wrong and retaliatory, and she was informed by Capt. Douglas to disregard the referral.  \n1165.  Plaintiff Knight was moved from the part of the office where she worked for Sgt. Griffin \nand placed under the department commander. Sgt Griffin was removed from the administrative \noffice. Shortly thereafter Plaintiff Knight was transferred to SOD. \n1166.  Plaintiff Knight served in SOD from 2009 to March of 2014. \n1167.  In March of 2014, Plaintiff Knight was sent back to the Fifth District from SOD. Plaintiff \nwas confused by the transfer because there didn’t appear to be a reason for it.  \n1168.  Plaintiff Knight contacted Chief Lamar Green (hereinafter “Chief Green”), to find out why \nshe had been transferred.  He investigated and informed Plaintiff that the order came from Chief \nCathy Lanier (hereinafter “Chief Lanier”) who was incensed about some incident that purportedly \ninvolved Plaintiff Knight.   \n1169.  Notably, Plaintiff Knight was punitively transferred before she was even informed or asked \nabout the incident. \n1170.  Plaintiff Knight was order to the Internal Affairs Department (hereinafter “IAD”) to be \ninterviewed by Sergeant Brad Wagner (hereinafter “Sgt. Wagner”).   \n1171.  Plaintiff Knight attended the meeting with her husband, Fred Knight (hereinafter “Mr. \nKnight”). IAD told Mr. Knight he couldn’t sit in on the interview because he was a potential \nwitness.  \n157 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 158 of 208\n \n1172.  In the interview, Plaintiff Knight was played a tape recording of a message left by a female \nvoice that stated:  “Hey Fred your wife is not at work.  She is having an affair with Captain Shelton, \nand she is with him right now.” \n1173.  At first, Plaintiff Knight thought she was called in to IAD to be accused of having an affair \nwith Captain Shelton, which she vehemently denied.    \n1174.  She soon discovered that she was being accused of having made the call to a different \n“Fred,” the husband of Officer Janice Oliver. \n1175.  Mr. Knight was taken into a separate room where IAD played him the tape to see if he \ncould identify the voice as Plaintiff Knight’s.  Essentially, IAD was trying to enlist Mr. Knight as \na witness against his wife.   Mr. Knight made clear that the voice was not Plaintiff’s. \n1176.  Plaintiff Knight immediately offered IAD her phone records to prove that she was not the \nperson who made the call at issue.  She also offered to take a polygraph and for a voice recognition \nexpert to be used to prove that the voice on the recording was not hers.  \n1177.  Plaintiff Knight passed the polygraph exam, but Chief Lanier would not accept that she \nwas innocent, despite the fact that Plaintiff’s phone records also proved she did not make the call, \nand was on patrol when the call was made. \n1178.  The MPD refused to pay for the voice recognition expert, so Plaintiff Knight paid for it \nherself to prove her innocence.  She took the voice recognition test in the presence of IAD to ensure \nthat they could not question the validity of the test.  \n1179.  The voice recognition expert concluded that the voice on the message was not Plaintiff \nKnight’s voice.  \n1180.  Sgt. Wager informed Chief Lanier that Plaintiff Knight was innocent, but Chief Lanier did \nnot care.  She refused to reverse Plaintiff Knight’s punitive transfer out of SOD.   \n158 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 159 of 208\n \n1181.  Plaintiff Knight met with Chief Alfred Durham (hereinafter “Chief Durham”) to complain \nabout the unfair way she was being treated.   \n1182.  Chief Durham stated that Plaintiff Knight would not be reinstated to SOD despite having \npassed all the tests proving her innocence, because Officer Olive still “believed” that Plaintiff had \nmade the call.   \n1183.  Chief Lanier chose to appease Officer Olive at Plaintiff Knight’s expense because Chief \nLanier and Officer Olive were close friends.  \n1184.  Plaintiff Knight escalated matters by reaching out to Mayor Bowser’s office.  An aid in the \nMayor’s office informed Plaintiff that her complaint would be investigated by the Office of the \nInspector General (hereinafter “OIG”). \n1185.  In December of 2014, nearly a year later, OIG called Plaintiff Knight to ascertain if she \nhad been transferred back to SOD.  She stated that she had not.   \n1186.  Two weeks later, Plaintiff Knight was transferred back to SOD.   \n1187.  Eventually, Officer Olive was fired for making false statements about having an affair. \nCapitan Shelton only received a letter of prejudice after making false statements, and for going to \nMaryland to engage in an illicit affair while on the clock. A few months later, he was arrested for \nDUI. He suffered no additional disciplinary action  \n1188.  Chief Lanier was not disciplined for abusing of her power or for retaliating against Plaintiff \nKnight. \n1189.  Officers in SOD were received scheduled overtime because of the staffing needs.  When \nPlaintiff Knight was reinstated to SOD, she was not given back pay for the overtime pay amount \nshe had been wrongfully denied.  \n159 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 160 of 208\n \n1190.  During  Plaintiff  Knight’s  absence  from  SOD,  the  leadership  of  the  department  had \nchanged.  When she returned, the SOD Lieutenant was Guillermo Rivera (hereinafter “Lt. Rivera”) \nand the Captain was Jeffrey Carroll (hereinafter “Cpt. Carroll). \n1191.  Lt. Rivera immediately began to disparage and retaliate against Plaintiff Knight, subjected \nher to far more restrictive work rules and procedures than her colleagues, and repeatedly accused \nher of things she had not done, or repeated disparaging rumors about her. \n1192.  Plaintiff Knight went to her supervisor Sgt. Jane Barrientos (hereinafter “Sgt. Barrientos) \nto complain about the way she was being treated, and asked that Sgt. Barrientos go with her to talk \nto Lt. Rivera about his constant disparaging comments about her.  Lt. Rivera was dismissive and \ndisrespectful during the meeting, refusing to change his inappropriate behavior.  \n1193.  The incessant bullying and disparagement from Lt. Rivera and others in SOD took its toll \non Plaintiff Knight, causing her extreme stress and anxiety. \n1194.  When a position on the Crash Review Board (hereinafter “CRB”) was posted as open, \nPlaintiff leapt at the opportunity.   \n1195.  Plaintiff Knight emailed Commander Stephen Sund (hereinafter Cdr. Sund) to inquire \nabout the position, and was immediately told “no,” without any explanation. \n1196.  A few days later, Cdr. Sund emailed Plaintiff Knight indicating that he would allow her to \ntake the assignment.  \n1197.  But upon her arrival, she was informed that Cpt. Carroll would not allow Plaintiff Knight \nto be placed in the CRB office, but would have to be moved into the Administrative Office so she \n“could be watched.”  This was yet another instance of disparate treatment Plaintiff endured.  \n1198.  Plaintiff Knight complained to Cdr. Sund by email about the way she was being treated \ndifferently than others, and unfairly singled-out for supervisory scrutiny.   \n160 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 161 of 208\n \n1199.  Eventually Cdr. Sund allowed Plaintiff to work in the CRB office she was assigned to, but \nmade sure she was aware that it was a trial assignment, to undermine her confidence and comfort \nin the position. \n1200.  In October of 2015, a letter from the OIG’s office acknowledging receipt of Plaintiff \nKnight’s complaint regarding the unfair and retaliatory transfer out of SOD, but that the OIG office \nconsidered the matter closed once she was transferred back to SOD. \n1201.  Plaintiff Knight attempted to contact Daniel Lucas (hereinafter “Mr. Lucas”) in the OIG’s \noffice to inform him that she felt she was still being retaliated against, and to seek accountability \nfor those who had falsely accused her.   \n1202.  Mr. Lucas did not acknowledge or respond to either Plaintiff Knight’s phone calls or her \nemails to him. \n1203.  Four months later, in February 2016, Plaintiff Knight was informed that she was being \nmoved from the supervisory control of Sgt. Barrientos to that of Sgt. Terry Thorne (white male), \nwho sat in a different building.   \n1204.  The explanation that was given for the change was that CRB, which investigated vehicle \naccidents,  was  “somewhat  like  traffic,”  so  Plaintiff  Knight  needed  to  be  under  the  Traffic \nDepartment. \n1205.  In reality, this was another act of retaliation, removing Plaintiff from the supervision of a \nfemale Sergeant whom Plaintiff Knight was comfortable working for, to a white male Sergeant \nwho later undertook a scheme to push her out of MPD. \n1206.  On information and belief, this move was orchestrated by Chief Lanier to retaliate against \nPlaintiff Knight going to OIG with a complaint about the unfair reassignment from SOD.  \n161 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 162 of 208\n \n1207.  Due to some promotions in the Spring of 2016, Plaintiff Knight reported to Cpt. Robert \nGlover (hereinafter “Cpt. Glover”). \n1208.  Cpt. Glover was openly rude and hostile to Plaintiff from the beginning of her tenure \nworking under him.  \n1209.  Cpt. Glover’s animus towards Plaintiff is demonstrated in an incident in June of 2016 in \nwhich Plaintiff was directed by Cdr. Carroll to send an overdue car accident case list to the \nProfessional Development Bureau (hereinafter “PDB”).   \n1210.  Plaintiff Knight complied with the directive by sending an email to the administrative inbox \nof the PDB. \n1211.  Lieutenant James Brown (hereinafter “Lt. Brown”) called Plaintiff Knight to ask why she \nwas inquiring about cases that were more than a year old.  She informed him that she had been \ndirected to do so by Cdr. Carroll.  \n1212.  Plaintiff Knight later was informed that Lt. Brown complained to Cpt. Glover about \nPlaintiff Knight, and accused Plaintiff Knight of sending him a nasty and unprofessional email. \n1213.  Cpt. Glover became irate at Plaintiff, without asking her anything about the exchange, and \ninsisted that an investigation be launched into her actions.  He further asserted that Plaintiff Knight \nneeded “to be watched.” \n1214.  Plaintiff Knight sent an email to her entire chain of command, attaching the email at issue, \nand defending her actions.  She asked the team to conduct a thorough investigation, and to hold \nLt. Brown accountable if his accusation proved to be unfounded. \n1215.  Cdr. Carroll ultimately concluded that Plaintiff Knight had done nothing wrong.  No \ndisciplinary action was taken against Lt. Brown for the false accusation, or for Cdr. Glover’s ill-\nconceived and unjustified overreaction.  \n162 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 163 of 208\n \n1216.  In response, and as a further act of retaliation, Cdr. Glover went to the Time and Attendance \nand asked Officers Eric Coates and James Jaffe to hyper-scrutinize Plaintiff Knight’s time entries, \naccusing Plaintiff Knight of “egregious” abuse and theft of paid time (a very serious offense). \n1217.  Upon being informed that Cdr. Glover had, without any basis in fact, accused Plaintiff \nKnight of stealing time, Plaintiff Knight had to again involve Cdr. Carroll. \n1218.  When Plaintiff Knight went to Cdr. Carroll’s office and tried to explain how she was being \ntargeted for personal retribution and attack by Cpt. Glover, Cdr. Carroll dismissed her concerns, \nand all but ignored her, responding that Plaintiff just had “a problem with everyone.” \n1219.  Cdr. Carroll did not take Plaintiff Knight’s allegations seriously, and did not feel that it \nwas his responsibility to address and remedy the animus, disparate treatment, and false accusations \nmade by Cpt. Glover.  \n1220.  Cdr. Carroll further admonished Plaintiff Knight because her email to the PDB admin \ninbox embarrassed Lt. Brown, even if it was sent at Cdr. Carroll’s instruction, and in no way was \naddressed specifically to Lt. Brown.   \n1221.  When Cdr. Carroll made clear that he was not going to do anything to address the unfair \nand disparate treatment that Plaintiff Knight was enduring, she informed him that she was going \nto speak to Chief Green. \n1222.  When Cdr. Carroll asked Plaintiff Knight what she expected Chief Green to do, she \ninformed him that she expected both  of them to  put  a stop  to Cpt. Glover’s campaign of \nharassment, and false accusations.   \n1223.  Plaintiff Knight left the meeting with Cdr. Carroll feeling defeated, having been informed \nby her senior manager that he did not believe it was his obligation to ensure that Plaintiff had a \nfair and non-discriminatory work environment.  \n163 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 164 of 208\n \n1224.  When she got back to her desk, Plaintiff Knight sent Cdr. Carroll the email that Cdr. Carroll \nhad claimed “embarrassed” Lt. Brown, just to make a record of what it was that had caused to the \nfury and backlash. \n1225.  On or about June 16, 2016, Cdr. Carroll sent a responsive email confirming that Plaintiff \nKnight had not done anything wrong and stated that he would speak with Cpt. Glover.  \n1226.  In 2017, Plaintiff Knight became an active union representative, and Cdr. Carroll was \npromoted to be Bureau Chief of the Homeland Security Department (hereinafter “HSB”).  Cpt. \nGlover became the Administrative Captain for SOD, which fell under HSB, and Cpt. Rivera was \npromoted to Commander of SOD. \n1227.  As union representative, Plaintiff Knight started to receive complaints from fellow officers \nabout the way Cpt. Glover was treating people.  She passed on their concerns and complaints to \nCdr. Rivera.  \n1228.  In 2018, Plaintiff Knight again became the target of a campaign of harassment and \ndisparate  treatment.    This  was  manifested  by hyper-scrutiny  of  her  work  assignments,  and \nchanging Plaintiff Knight’s assignments without informing her, to cause confusion and chaos in \nher work schedule.  \n1229.  Plaintiff Knight was so disdained by her leadership that one of them, Lt. Darian Jones \n(hereinafter “Lt. Jones”), took to pretending that he was mistaking Plaintiff for Sgt. Boyd, a large \nAfrican American male officer with a full beard.  It was a thinly veiled attempt to denigrate and \ndisparage Plaintiff’s appearance that Lt. Jones engaged in on several occasions.  \n1230.  When  Plaintiff  Knight  complained  to  Cdr.  Rivera  about  the  blatant  animosity  and \ndisrespect from Lt. Jones, Cdr. Rivera dismissed her concern, claiming that Lt. Jones had a right \nto “inquire about resources.” \n164 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 165 of 208\n \n1231.  Lt. Jones had such hostility to Plaintiff Knight that chastised a subordinate Sgt. Keith \nJackson (hereinafter “Sgt. Jackson”), for giving Plaintiff Knight an overtime opportunity, and \nmade clear that he did not want Plaintiff assigned to special events.  \n1232.  Sgt Jackson also received a call from Lt. Margiotta, the Lieutenant over the Events Section, \ndemanding to know why Plaintiff Knight was working in Special Events. \n1233.  Sgt. Jackson later informed Plaintiff Knight that she was “hot,” a term used in MPD to \nrefer to officers who are unwelcome and targeted for bullying and retaliation.   \n1234.  He told Plaintiff Knight that because Lt. Jones did not like her, he could no longer assign \nPlaintiff to overtime for the Special Events department, thus isolating her, retaliating against her, \nand making her subject to disparate treatment and a hostile work environment.  \n1235.  After this, and several other incidents that made clear that Plaintiff Knight was being \ntargeted for bullying and retaliation, on or about March 23, 2019, Plaintiff Knight sent an email to \nChief Newsom requesting to speak to him about her hostile work environment.   \n1236.  Approximately a week later, Cdr. Rivera sent an email to the entire department stating that \nthe EEO team would be addressing the department on EEO policy.  \n1237.  In June of 2019, tensions with Cpt. Glover escalated again.  Plaintiff Knight was part of a \nteam tasked with formulating a Memorial Day Schedule for 2020.   \n1238.  Cpt. Glover was combative and hostile during the entire meeting, and during the meeting, \ndecided he was going to conduct a separate meeting with his “Admin” team.    \n1239.  Plaintiff Knight believed that she was part of the “Admin” team. \n1240.  Cpt. Glover adjourned the meeting, and Plaintiff Knight left to go back to work. On her \nway, she ran into one of the attendees who informed Plaintiff Knight that Cpt. Glover was \nconducting a meeting with everyone, but Plaintiff Knight. \n165 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 166 of 208\n \n1241.  When Plaintiff Knight knocked on the door to enter, Cpt. Glover opened the door, told \nPlaintiff she wasn’t invited, and slammed the door in her face.  This act was in violation of \nDepartment policy on professionalism.  \n1242.  Furthermore, Cpt. Glover informed the people in the meeting that they were no longer to \nshare information with Plaintiff, and to change all the passwords and codes to all systems so that \nPlaintiff Knight could use them to do her job.  \n1243.  He also informed the team not to ask Plaintiff Knight for any assistance.  \n1244.  Plaintiff Knight requested a meeting with Cdr. Rivera, who immediately took Cpt. Glover’s \nside and refused to address the blatant disrespect and inappropriate behavior of Cpt. Glover.  \n1245.  Eventually, Plaintiff Knight met with Chief Carroll because her management team refused \nto take seriously or address the daily disparate and hostile treatment that Plaintiff Knight was being \nsubjected to.   \n1246.  Plaintiff Knight further informed Chief Carroll that the racism, sexism and retaliation she \nwas being subjected to was also being visited upon other Black women officers. \n1247.  Rather than address the issue with his management team, Chief Newsham asked Alphonso \nLee of EEO to reach out to Plaintiff Knight to listen to her “concerns.”   \n1248.  But instead of actually listening to, or trying to address, any of Plaintiff Knight’s concerns \nand claims, Mr. Lee gave Plaintiff Knight information on getting EEO “counseling,” and let her \nknow that she had a right to file a complaint with the District of Columbia Office of Human Rights \n(hereinafter “OHR”). \n1249.  On or about October 1, 2019, Plaintiff Knight went to the Deputy Mayor's office and met \nwith Daisha Winham (hereinafter “Ms. Winham”) to report her concerns about discrimination \nwithing MPD.  \n166 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 167 of 208\n \n1250.  Plaintiff  Knight  informed  Ms.  Winham  of  her  concerns  regarding  racial  inequality, \nretaliation and unfair working conditions, provided Ms. Winham with a written summary of \nPlaintiff’s concerns.  \n1251.  Plaintiff Knight was deliberate in informing Ms. Winham of Plaintiff Knight’s fears and \nconcerns about retaliation she would suffer for speaking out.   \n1252.  Specifically, Plaintiff Knight mentioned that she had concerns with the Chief Manlapaz of \nthe Internal Affairs Division, who had made it known that he “intended” to retaliate against \nPlaintiff Knight.  \n1253.  Plaintiff Knight never heard anything back from the deputy Mayor’s office. \n1254.  Undeterred,  Plaintiff  Knight  then  went  to  Councilman  Charles  Allen’s  (hereinafter \n“Councilmember Allen”) office requesting to see him.   \n1255.  Plaintiff Knight was instructed to send Councilmember Allen an email, which Plaintiff \nKnight did.  \n1256.  Plaintiff Knight did not receive a response from the Councilmember’s Office. \n1257.  On or about October 14, 2019, Plaintiff Knight spoke with Alana Sisnett (hereinafter Ms. \nSisnett) from Mayors Bowsers office.  \n1258.  Plaintiff Knight spoke with Ms. Sisnett about racial inequality in the promotional and \nhiring process, the practice of some in the MPD of falsifying crime statistics, and the fact that \nMPD EEO appeared to be working on behalf of management, and to the detriment of, and against \ncomplainants.  \n1259.  Plaintiff Knight further asserted that Black women officers were not receiving fair and \nimpartial investigations, and further informed Ms. Sisnett that IAD Chief Manlapaz was making \n167 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 168 of 208\n \nit known about he planned to retaliate against Plaintiff Knight for complaining outside the chain \nof command.  \n1260.  On or about October 18, 2019, Chief Manlapaz cornered union representative Hiram \nRivera (hereinafter “Officer Rivera), interrogating him about Plaintiff Knight and her activities. \nOfficer Rivera reported back to Plaintiff Knight that Chief Manlapaz was on the  warpath for her.  \n1261.  Later that day, Plaintiff Knight was told that she was under investigation because there \nwere two cases that she worked on “missing” from the MPD car accident filing system.  \n1262.  Plaintiff Knight was given a question & answer form her commander, and told that she \nneeded to send a spreadsheet of her cases to Chief Manlapaz.   \n1263.  Plaintiff Knight asserts that Chief Manlapaz was making good on his promise and threat to \nretaliate against Plaintiff for complaining about racial and gender discrimination at the MPD. \n1264.  Plaintiff Knight later learned that certain files and hard copy and memos had disappeared \nfrom the files she worked on, for which she was disciplined, even though no evidence was \npresented that she was responsible for removing the missing records.  \n1265.  Plaintiff Knight asserts that the files were sabotaged to implicate her as part of a scheme to \nretaliate against her for complaining about race and gender discrimination. \n1266.  During Plaintiff Knight’s appeal of the discipline she received, it was discovered and noted \nthat Cdr. Rivera had removed important information from the investigation that was favorable \ntoward Plaintiff Knight.  \n1267.  Lt. Walter Flemins, who investigated the case, had requested that the case against Plaintiff \nKnight be dropped, but Chiefs Carrol and Manlapaz denied the request.  \n168 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 169 of 208\n \n1268.  Plaintiff Knight asserts that Chiefs Carrol and Manlapaz denied the request to drop the \ninvestigation  against  Plaintiff  Knight  because  they  were  seeking  a  reason  to  terminate  her \nemployment, and to retaliate against her for engaging in protected activity.  \n1269.  During the ordinary course of her work, Plaintiff Knight received a performance evaluation \ncompleted by her direct supervisor, Sgt. Barrientos.  That performance evaluation, written by the \nperson who directly observed Plaintiff’s performance, gave Plaintiff the highest possible rating of \na five (5). \n1270.  On or about November 27, 2019, Cdr. Rivera informed Sgt. Barrientos that she was no \nlonger going to supervise Plaintiff, and Cdr. Rivera deleted Plaintiff’s completed performance \nevaluation, substituting it with one that he wrote himself.   \n1271.  Cdr. Rivera dropped Plaintiff Knight’s performance score from a five (5), which was \nconsistent with Plaintiff’s rating for the previous ten (10) years, to a three (3).   \n1272.  The purported justification for the drop in rating was the fact that Plaintiff was the subject \nof an investigation initiated by Chief Manlapaz. No other significant performance deficiency was \nidentified to justify the uncharacteristically low rating.  \n1273.  In December of 2019, Plaintiff Knight had an interview with the OHR to discuss her \nconcerns about racial and gender discrimination at the MPD, and the systemic culture of retaliation \nshe had been subjected to. Plaintiff Knight met with Joy Board (hereinafter “Ms. Board”).  \n1274.  Plaintiff Knight provided Ms. Board with a written copy of her EEOC complaint against \nMPD that included racial inequality, favoritism and unfair working conditions.  \n1275.  Ms. Board told Plaintiff Knight that MPD was past the allotted time for providing her with \nan Exit Letter. Plaintiff Knight responded that the Exit Letter had nothing to do with her complaint.  \n169 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 170 of 208\n \n1276.  Ms. Board informed Plaintiff Knight that Mr. Lee knew that OHR was only going to \ninvestigate what was in the Exit Letter.   \n1277.  Plaintiff  Knight  started  to  get  upset  because  once  again,  her  serious  concerns  and \ncomplaints were being brushed off as irrelevant.  \n1278.  Ms. Board agreed to go through the process anyway, but it appeared that this was to placate.  \n1279.  On or about March 18, 2020, Plaintiff received a DocuSign from Ms. Board. The document \naddressed an overtime issue concerning Officer Wells and Cdr. Glover, but none of the racial \ninequality, favoritism and unfair treatment complaints raised by Plaintiff Knight.   \n1280.  On or about March 19, 2020, Plaintiff Knight sent an email to Ms. Board informing her the \nbases of her complaint were not addressed. Plaintiff Knight informed Ms. Board that the write-up, \nwhich only covered an overtime issue, did not address her concerns, and that Plaintiff Knight \nwould therefore not sign it.  \n1281.  Thereafter,  OHR  issued  a  letter  conveying  OHR’s  Administrative  Dismissal  of  the \ncomplaint, despite the fact that it failed to even acknowledge, let alone actually investigate, any of \nthe claims Plaintiff raised in her complaint.   \n1282.  OHR further indicated that Plaintiff Knight’s complaint was untimely and lacked any merit. \nPlaintiff’s response was sent to OHR the day after she received their correspondence in the mail.  \nIt was in no way untimely. \n1283.  On or about January 16, 2020, Plaintiff Knight testified under oath before Councilmember \nAllen regarding the pattern of falsification of police reports, racial inequalities, and unfair hiring \nand testing practices at the MPD.  \n170 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 171 of 208\n \n1284.  Plaintiff Knight asserted to Councilmember Allen that if MPD leadership didn’t do more \nto promote minorities within the next ten (10) years, there would be no minorities at the top levels \nof MPD.  \n1285.  Councilmember Allen specifically asked if Plaintiff Knight was being retaliated against. \n1286.  Plaintiff stated that she was. She recounted to Councilmember Allen that she was being \nretaliated against by Chief Manlapaz of IAD. \n1287.  Councilmember Allen stated that he would get back to Plaintiff Knight, but and he never \ndid. \n1288.  In furtherance of the scheme to retaliate against Plaintiff Knight, she was written up twice \nin February of 2020 for fabricated transgressions.   \n1289.  On or about April 22, 2020, Plaintiff Knight received a phone call from IAD agent Michael \nAmes  (hereinafter  “Agent  Ames”),  informing  her  that  she  was  the  target  of  yet  another \n“investigation.”  \n1290.  Plaintiff Knight immediately told Agent Ames about Chief Manlapaz informing people \nwithin the MPD that he intended to retaliate against Plaintiff, and that he was gunning for her.   \n1291.  Plaintiff Knight put Agent Ames on notice that there was legitimate reason to believe the \ninvestigation was contrived, and was an act of retaliation.  \n1292.  Agent Ames told Plaintiff Knight that the investigation was about an email she sent to \nOHR, and more specifically, that the Plaintiff Knight had mentioned that she had recorded \nCommander Rivera in that email.  \n1293.  Information that complainants provide to OHR is supposed to remain confidential.  \n1294.  Plaintiff Knight was interviewed nine (9) times about the alleged recording, but not a single \ntime about the content and substance of her OHR complaint.  \n171 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 172 of 208\n \n1295.  As a result of the investigation, Plaintiff Knight was informed that she was going to be \nsuspended for twenty-eight (28) days.  At the time, there was no MPD policy against recording \nconversations. \n1296.  It is not a violation of Washington DC law to record a conversation without the prior \nconsent of the person recorded. \n1297.  On or about April 30, 2020, Plaintiff Knight sent an email to Chief Newsham detailing the \nthings that were happening to her.   \n1298.  She implored Chief Newsham to pay attention and act on the discrimination, disparate \ntreatment, and contrived and intentional retaliation and bullying that was taking place at MPD.  \nPlaintiff received no response from Chief Newsham. \n1299.  Through her Union Steward, Officer Rosario, Plaintiff filed a grievance with respect to the \nsuspension, and the union demanded arbitration of the suspension.  The union is not required to \ndemand arbitration on all grievances, but it did choose to pursue this one.  \n1300.  On  or  about  June  4,  2020,  Plaintiff  Knight  informed  the  MPD  Director  of  Human \nResources Angela Simpson, that she was being retaliated against. \n1301.  On or about July 6, 2020, Plaintiff Knight was ordered back to IAD to speak with agent \nwas David Chumbley (hereinafter “Agent Chumbley”). She appeared at the interview with her \nUnion Steward Rosario.  \n1302.  Agent Chumbley was so hostile and aggressive in the interview that Officer Rosario \nstepped in and stopped the interview and asked for another IAD official to intercede.  \n1303.  Approximately a month later, Plaintiff Knight was ordered back to IAD for another \ninterview, but given the hostile and unproductive comportment of Agent Chumbley, Plaintiff was \ninterviewed this time by Captain Pamela Wheeler (hereinafter “Cpt. Wheeler”).  \n172 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 173 of 208\n \n1304.  Captain Wheeler asked questions about Plaintiff’s testimony before the city council. \nHowever, Captain Wheeler also tried to convince Plaintiff that she was not being retaliated against \nas a result of that testimony because the investigation and disciplinary action against her began \nbefore the city council testimony occurred.   \n1305.  Plaintiff Knight informed Captain Wheeler that the investigation and discipline was a result \nof multiple complaints against Chief Manlapaz and others, but escalated after the city council \ntestimony.   \n1306.  On or about September 24, 2020, Plaintiff Knight received a memo from Chief Newsham \nin response to her appeal of the 28 days suspension, stating that Plaintiff failed to be forthright \nduring the investigation into her recording of Cdr. Rivera.   \n1307.  Chief Newsham’s memo did not mention any of the claims and concerns Plaintiff Knight \nraised to Chief Newsham, and did not address that no evidence against Plaintiff Knight was \ndiscovered in the investigation.  It further failed to state why recording Cdr. Rivera would be a \nviolation of MPD policy.  \n1308.  Nevertheless, Plaintiff’s suspension was rescinded, and she instead received a letter of \ncensure.  Plaintiff Knight sought to go back to SOD, her original department. \n1309.  On or about February 17, 2021, Chief Chanel Dickerson (hereinafter “Chief Dickerson”) \ntold Plaintiff Knight to complete a transfer form to go back to her assignment at SOD.  \n1310.  At the time, Plaintiff Knight was temporarily assigned to Chief Dickerson’s office for a \nproject, but by then, the project was complete.  \n1311.  Three days later, on or about February 20, 2021, Chief Dickerson called Plaintiff Knight \nto inform her that Chief Contee refused to allow Plaintiff Knight to go back to SOD, and that Chief \nContee wasn’t going to require that any other department receive Plaintiff Knight.   \n173 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 174 of 208\n \n1312.  This was a direct and intentional denial of job and promotional opportunities to Plaintiff \nKnight by Chief Contee, as well as act that would negatively affect Plaintiff Knight’s pay.   \n1313.  Plaintiff Knight viewed this as an act of retaliation and a negative employment action to \npunish her for her protected activity.  \n1314.  Because Plaintiff Knight’s only option at that point was to go back to patrol, she feared \nthat any further retaliation would result in loss of her job because there would be nowhere else for \nher to go.   \n1315.  Given that no entity in the District of Columbia was willing to take her claims and concerns \nseriously, and that no member of MPD leadership was willing to restrain the rampant and \nintentional retaliation against Plaintiff Knight, Plaintiff Knight opted to retire from the MPD on or \nabout March 24, 2021.  \nPlaintiff Knight’s Individual Causes of Action \n  Race Discrimination and Retaliation Claims \n1316.  Plaintiff Knight incorporates and restates all of the previous factual allegations contained \nin this Complaint as if fully restated herein. \n1317.

Plaintiff Knight incorporates and restates all information and allegations contained in the \npreceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n1335.  Pursuant to the District of Columbia Whistleblower Protection Act D.C. Code § 1-615-51 \net seq., Defendants are prohibited from reassigning, terminating or otherwise retaliating against a \n176 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 177 of 208\n \nD.C. government employee as a result of that employee’s protected disclosures that the employee \nreasonably believes show gross mismanagement, gross misuse or waste of government resources, \nand abuse of authority in the connection with the administration of a government program, or a \nviolation of a state, local or federal law, rule or regulation.  \n1336.  Plaintiff Knight was an employee who, as a result of her disclosures to her supervisors, the \nsenior leadership of her department, the EEO Department of the MPD, Assistant Chief Caron, \nChief Newsham, the District of Columbia City Council, the Office of the Mayor and the EEOC \nabout the systemic discrimination in the MPD, and the complicity of the MPD EEO Department \nin perpetuating it and protecting those who engage in it, ethical violations that included leaking \nconfidential  witness  statements,  the  creation  of  a  chilling  and  retaliatory  work  culture  that \ndiscouraged officers from complaining about mistreatment and inappropriate police conduct, \nenjoyed the protection of DCWPA.  \n1337.

Plaintiff Knight has incurred lost wages, loss of reputation and loss of career opportunity \nnow and into the future, and all the other losses stated herein. \n1341.

Plaintiff Lockerman joined the DC Metropolitan Police Department in November 2003 and \nwas first assigned to the Fourth District Station. \n1343.  Plaintiff Lockerman was promoted to Sergeant June 2016 and assigned to the Sixth \nDistrict, and was against promoted to Lieutenant in of June 2019, and assigned to the Seventh \nDistrict. \n1344.  In December 2019, Plaintiff Lockerman was transferred to the Second District, per her own \nrequest. \n1345.  On March 5, 2020, Plaintiff Lockerman attended a crime briefing and private lunch with \nCommander Duncan Bedlion (hereinafter “Cdr. Bedlion”) (white male). \n1346.  While Plaintiff Lockerman believed that the luncheon was for professional reasons, Cdr. \nBedlion implied that he wanted to engage in conversation of a personal nature, which made \nPlaintiff Lockerman uncomfortable. \n1347.  The conversation was not sexual per se, however, Plaintiff Lockerman was alone with her \nboss in a social setting, and she put off by the direction of the conversation. \n1348.  From that point forward, Cdr. Bedlion began to retaliate against Plaintiff Lockerman for \nher cool reaction to his attempt at conversation on personal and private matters. \n178 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 179 of 208\n \n1349.  Plaintiff Lockerman was placed on sick leave from March 26 thru April 8, 2020, however, \nPlaintiff Lockerman was assigned two tasks that were due during the time that she was out on sick \nleave. \n1350.  Although Plaintiff Lockerman was away on approved sick leave, she was issued discipline \nat the order of Cdr. Bedlion, for not turning in the assignments on time.   \n1351.  It is not MPD policy that officers be disciplined for assignments they miss while they are \non approved leave. \n1352.  While reviewing her evaluation with Captain Edward Bernat (hereinafter “Cpt. Bernat”) \n(now retired), Plaintiff Lockerman was informed that Cdr. Bedlion was urging Cpt. Bernat to place \nPlaintiff Lockerman on a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP).   \n1353.  Capt. Bernat refused, informing Cdr. Bedlion that Plaintiff Lockerman did not deserve to \nbe placed on a PIP.   \n1354.  It was nevertheless very concerning to Plaintiff that Cdr. Bedlion was so angry at being \nrebuffed that he would try to attack her fitness as an officer and impede her career. \n1355.  On or about October 3, 2021, Plaintiff Lockerman was issued discipline for failing to post \non the Next-Door application, which is a social media platform designed to inform the community \ncrimes in the area of public interest, or in which the MPD is seeking information from the public.   \n1356.  Plaintiff Lockerman explained that there was an arrest made in that situation, so there was \nno further danger to the public or need for information from the public, which is why Plaintiff \nLockerman didn’t think that it was necessary to make the post.   \n1357.  Nevertheless, discipline was issued.  \n1358.  Plaintiff  Lockerman  scheduled  a  meeting  with  Cdr.  Bedlion  and  Cpt.  Brian  Bray \n(hereinafter “Cpt. Bray”) to discuss the discipline for not posting on the Next-Door app. \n179 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 180 of 208\n \n1359.  Cdr. Bedlion spent the entire meeting berating and denigrating Plaintiff Lockerman.   \n1360.  During the meeting, Cdr. Bedlion stated that he didn’t think favorably of employees that \nmade requests to transfer from one district to the next (although this is common practice at MPD, \nand two other white Lieutenants were transferred as well).   \n1361.  Cdr. Bedlion also falsely accused Plaintiff Lockerman of having issues with her work \nperformance in the Seventh District.   \n1362.  In fact, Plaintiff Lockerman had no major disciplinary issues and was never placed on a \nPIP at the Seventh District. \n1363.  Cdr. Bedlion further stated to Plaintiff Lockerman that he has made other people cry that \nsat in the same chair that she was sitting in at the time.  Cdr. Bedlion was very proud of the fact \nthat he made other people cry, an appeared to have made the comment to intimidate and threaten \nPlaintiff Lockerman. \n1364.  It is MPD policy, and in accordance with COVID-19 protocols, that officers wear a face \nmask while on duty and in an enclosed space. \n1365.  On or about , Plaintiff Lockerman directed a subordinate to put his mask on properly per \nthat Executive Order.   \n1366.  The subordinate officer felt offended that he was directed to put his mask on (which should \nhave been on anyway) and filed a complaint against Plaintiff Lockerman.   \n1367.  Cdr. Bedlion ordered his subordinate Captain Peter Frenzel (hereinafter “Cpt. Frenzel”) to \nbegin  an  administrative  investigation  into  Plaintiff  Lockerman  for  a  “Potential  Orders  and \nDirectives Violation” for giving the subordinate a lawful directive. \n180 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 181 of 208\n \n1368.  Plaintiff  Lockerman  was  ultimately  exonerated  by  Assistant  Chief  Lamar  Green \n(hereinafter “Asst. Chief Green”), however Plaintiff Lockerman was made to endure long and \nstressful investigation for no reason. \n1369.  The subordinate she directed to cover his face was out of order, putting other officers at \nrisk, and insubordinate to a superior officer.  \n1370.  By treating Lt. Lockerman as if she was at fault, and as if she did not have proper authority \nto  direct  her subordinates to  comply with  directives, Cdr. Bedlion directly undermined Lt. \nLockerman, diminished her in the eyes of her colleagues and subordinates and maligned her \ncharacter. \n1371.  Plaintiff Lockerman complained about her unfair treatment end excessive punishment by \nCdr. Bedlion to Assistant Chief Green.  He advised Plaintiff to take her complaint to MPD EEO.   \n1372.  On or about February 18, 202, Plaintiff Lockerman made a complaint to EEO, outlining \nthe pattern of retaliation she was being subjected to by Cdr. Bedlion.  She spoke with EEO \nCounselor Doreen Haines, and gave details of what Cdr. Bedlion was doing to her. \n1373.  EEO did not sustain the complaint and directed Plaintiff Lockerman to resolve the matter \nwith her chain of command.  Nothing further was done. \n1374.  Although Plaintiff Lockerman made a post on Next Door within a few hours of the \noccurrence of the crime, which was fully compliant with the general order on such posts, Cdr. \nBedlion nevertheless issued Plaintiff Lockerman a Letter of Prejudice for not making a post  to the \nNext-Door app in what he unilaterally deemed to be “timely manner.” \n1375.  On information and belief, Cdr. Bedlion held Plaintiff to a different standard than the other \nLieutenants when it came to timely posting on Next Door. \n181 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 182 of 208\n \n1376.  For example, on or about March 3, 2021, Lieutenant Darren Haskis (hereinafter “Lt. \nHaskis”), a white male officer, failed to post a social media notification for several hours after \nbeing relieved of duty.   \n1377.  On information and belief, Lt. Haskis was not reprimanded.   \n1378.  Not only is Lt. Haskis a white male, but he is perceived to be a friend of Cdr. Bedlion, and \nin his favor. \n1379.  On or November 20, 2020, Plaintiff Lockerman contracted COVID-19, and was placed on \nadministrative leave by human resources.   \n1380.  Cdr. Bedlion ordered his subordinate, Cpt. Bray to instruct the time and attendance clerk, \nMs. Joann Coombs (hereinafter “Ms. Coombs”), to dock Plaintiff Lockerman’s earned annual \nleave for her time off, which is fraud and against policy. \n1381.  Ms. Coombs managed the situation, and did not dock Plaintiff for the COVID-19 time off.  \n1382.  On or about April 5, 2021, Cdr. Bedlion emailed Plaintiff Lockerman directing her to join \nthe evening and midnight shift officers in meeting with the program director for the Latin \nAmerican Youth Center (hereinafter “LAYC”), the management of the building that housed the \nLAYC, and a private citizen who was complaining about the kids at the LAYC. \n1383.  Plaintiff Lockerman reached out and spoke to the LAYC Program Director, the building \nowner and the private citizen, and attempted to address the issues.  However, she directed her \nsubordinate sergeant to attend the on-site meeting, because she was scheduled for her bi-annual \nphysical on that evening, which had been scheduled for months, and which she was not allowed \nto reschedule.  \n182 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 183 of 208\n \n1384.  Commander Bedlion directed Cpt. Frenzel to issue a letter of counseling regarding this \nbecause, he stated that going to the clinic did not excuse her from arranging a meeting in front of \nthe building.   \n1385.  This confused Plaintiff Lockerman because it was her understanding that the meeting was \nto resolve the issue, which Plaintiff Lockerman was able to address through phone conversation.   \n1386.  To the extent that Cdr. Bedlion wanted a physical police presence in front of the building, \nthere was no reason why Plaintiff Lockerman’s Sergeant could not provide that presence and \nvisibility. \n1387.  It is important to note that Plaintiff Lockerman’s physical was late in the evening and the \nbuilding management and staff of the LAYC were not on-site at 10 pm, therefore the issue could \nnot have been resolved at that time. \n1388.  Because  of  Cdr.  Bedlion’s  unreasonable  demand,  Plaintiff  was  put  in  an  untenable \nsituation.  She would have disciplined for missing the physical, and was disciplined for not \nfollowing Cdr. Bedlion’s exact instruction. \n1389.  Nevertheless, Cdr. Bedlion ordered Cpt. Frenzel to issue to Plaintiff Lockerman a “letter \nof counseling,” which is not a standard MPD form, but something that Cdr. Bedlion invented to \nuse in his department. \n1390.  On or about May 6, 2021, Plaintiff Lockerman became ill with a sinus infection. \n1391.  She informed Cpt. Bray that she was ill, and was opting to take an optional sick leave  (a \nthree-day period) that would have her off on the next shift.   \n1392.  Cdr. Bedlion found out about it, and ordered Cpt. Bray to force Plaintiff Lockerman to go \nto the clinic if she wanted the time off, which is in violation of the MPD rules. \n183 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 184 of 208\n \n1393.  Cpt. Bray left Plaintiff Lockerman a message that she was being ordered to the clinic while \nshe was on sick leave, unless she accepted an overtime assignment on the next Saturday, which \nshe was previously scheduled as a vacation day for Plaintiff Lockerman, and had been set months \nprior. \n1394.  Plaintiff felt like this was retaliatory and punitive, and done simply to make her miserable, \nand take from her earned time off. \n1395.  On or about May 19, 2021, Plaintiff Lockerman actually received the letter of counseling \nfrom Cpt. Frenzel about the LAYC incident. \n1396.  On or about July 19, 2021, Plaintiff Lockerman was issued another letter of counseling for \nfailing  to  respond  and  notify  the  community  by  emailing    the  local  stakeholders  of  a \nrobbery/kidnapping that occurred in her assigned area.   \n1397.  Plaintiff Lockerman was not the Watch Commander that night.   \n1398.  Cpt. Bray was the watch commander that evening, and it was the responsibility of the \nWatch Commander to make the notifications to the community during their shift, which he did. \n1399.  Had Plaintiff made the notification, it would have been duplicative.  \n1400.  Again, Plaintiff Lockerman was disciplined for something that was not her responsibility, \nand not in accordance with department rules.  And once again, the order to discipline Plaintiff \nLockerman came from Cdr. Bedlion. \n1401.  Plaintiff Lockerman took two weeks of annual leave from August 5 thru August 21, 2021.  \n1402.  During that time Ms. Coombs stated that she was approached by Cdr. Bedlion, demanding \nto know who authorized Plaintiff Lockerman’s leave because there was a staffing shortage at the \ntime.   \n184 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 185 of 208\n \n1403.  Although, there were obviously several Departmental Lieutenants who were not working \nat that time (hence the shortage), Cdr. Bedlion only inquired about Plaintiff Lockerman.  \n1404.  Plaintiff Lockerman was again scheduled for annual leave for September 5 thru September \n14, 2021.  The administrative Lieutenant, Michael Hamelin (hereinafter “Lt. Hamlin”), asked \nPlaintiff Lockerman if she could cancel leave the 5th  of September, and Plaintiff Lockerman \nagreed.   \n1405.  Plaintiff Lockerman also requested to have the leave she had scheduled for September 12-\n14, 2021, cancelled.   \n1406.  However, her request was denied by Cdr. Bedlion. \n1407.  Plaintiff Lockerman called Mr. Mark Viehmeyer (hereinafter “Mr. Viehmeyer”), Labor \nRelations, on or about Thursday, September 2, 2021, and left a message regarding this ongoing \nissue with Cdr. Bedlion. \n1408.  On or about September 8, 2021, Plaintiff Lockerman went to Mr. Viehmeyer’s office and \nspoke with him in person, because he had failed to return her call.   \n1409.  Plaintiff Lockerman was directed to attempt to resolve the issue with Assistant Chief \nEmerman (hereinafter “Asst. Chief Emerman”). \n1410.  On September 8, 2021, Plaintiff Lockerman briefly met with Assistant Chief Emerman, \nand he advised her that she could cancel her leave and return to work on September 12, 2021. \n1411.  Plaintiff Lockerman had another scheduled meeting with Assistant Chief Emerman on or \nabout  September 14, 2021, wherein  she reported the hostile working environment  she was \nenduring because of Cdr. Bedlion.  Plaintiff specifically asserted that she believed she was being \ntargeted because of her race and gender. \n185 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 186 of 208\n \n1412.  Asst. Chief Emerman advised that he would speak with Cdr. Bedlion regarding the \nsituation and get back to her. \n1413.  or about, September 15, 2021, Plaintiff Lockerman met with Cpt. Frenzel, wherein she was \nserved with an official reprimand for failing to notify the community stakeholders of an incident \nthat took place while Plaintiff was on leave. \n1414.  The Watch Commander for that shift had properly notified the community stakeholders of \nthe event.  So, there was no reason or need for Plaintiff to renotify the community, and she was \nscheduled to return to work until the next shift. \n1415.  Plaintiff was also served with a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP), even though Cpt. \nFrenzle advised Plaintiff Lockerman that she would be receiving a favorable annual evaluation. \n1416.  It was stated in the PIP that Plaintiff Lockerman’s days off would be changed due to her \n“need of more supervision,” although it was unclear as to what she needed supervision on. \n1417.  Importantly, the change of days-off did not included Saturday night, which is the busiest \nnight of the week, and ostensibly the night in which Plaintiff Lockerman would need the most help \nand supervision.   \n1418.  During  the conference  Cpt.  Frenzel  brought  up incidents  from  the Seventh  District.  \nPlaintiff Lockerman transferred from the Seventh District almost two years, prior. \n1419.  This indicated to her that her management team was looking for reasons to attack her. \nDuring the conference, Cpt. Frenzel mentioned that Plaintiff had late correspondence. \n1420.  Plaintiff Lockerman stated that she had not had any later correspondence during the PIP \nperiod.   \n1421.  Cpt. Frenzel admitted that the late correspondence from more than a year ago, under a \ndifferent Captain, and occurred while Plaintiff was on sick leave.   \n186 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 187 of 208\n \n1422.  Plaintiff asked why Cpt. was bringing up a deficiency that was addressed, and really wasn’t \na fair criticism in the first place. \n1423.  During the conference, Cpt. Frenzel mentioned Plaintiff Lockerman’s relationships with \nher co-workers.   \n1424.  He later admitted that he was only speaking of the subordinate officer that Plaintiff \nLockerman directed to wear a mask, and a fellow Lieutenant who was only briefly assigned to the \ndistrict, and with whom Plaintiff Lockerman had not worked.   \n1425.  By contrast, several officers have filed complaints against Cdr. Bedlion, and he has not \nbeen disciplined in any way for his relationship with his subordinates. \n1426.  Plaintiff asserts that this is another example of race and gender discrimination and disparate \ntreatment at MPD. \n1427.  According to MPD policy, it is not proper to base a PIP that on deficiencies that occurred \nover a year prior to the rating period.  Cpt. Frenzle was basically saying that he would be rating \nPlaintiff Lockerman in 2022, for something that supposedly occurred in 2020. \n1428.  Plaintiff herein asserts that the PIP, the discipline and the change in schedule are acts of \nretaliation against her for complaining of race and gender discrimination. \n1429.  Plaintiff asserts herein that her EEO Complaint was not fully and fairly investigated, and \nthat she is being victimized by unfair policies and procedures in the EEO process. \n1430.  In his latest gambit to target Plaintiff Lockerman, Cdr. Bedlion has created a schedule in \nwhich  all  of  the  Watch  Commander  duties  for  the  entire  midnight  shift  land  on  Plaintiff \nLockerman, and Captain Sharell Williams (black female), and none of those duties are shouldered \nby the male management officers of the Second District for that tour. \n187 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 188 of 208\n \n1431.  Plaintiff asserts that Cdr. Bedlion and his subordinate officers are colluding to push her out \nof the MPD, based on unfair, inaccurate and overly harsh discipline, and other management actions \nthat violate MPD policy. \n       Plaintiff Lockerman’s Individual Causes of Action \n    Race Discrimination and Retaliation Claims \n1432.  Plaintiff Lockerman incorporates and restates all of the previous factual allegations \ncontained in this Complaint as if fully restated herein. \n1433.  Plaintiff Lockerman, on her own behalf, asserts herein claims pursuant to Title VII of the \nCivil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e, et seq.;  the District of Columbia Human \nRights Act, District of Columbia Code § 2-1401.01 et seq., and the Civil Rights Act of 1866 \nDiscrimination Based on Race in the Making and Enforcing of Contracts 42 U.S.C. §1981(a) by \nway of, through and via 42 U.S.C. § 1983. \n1434.  Plaintiff Lockerman was treated disparately, subjected to a hostile work environment and \nretaliated against for complaining about and opposing the race discrimination to which she was \nsubjected.  \n1435.  The facts alleged above, if proven, constitute discrimination, and systematic retaliation \nsevere and pervasive enough to be compensable. \n1436.  The facts alleged above, taken in conjunction with the facts alleged by the other nine (9) \nCRPs, establish that Defendant maintained a pattern, practice and custom of race discrimination \nagainst Black women police officers on the basis of race.  \n1437.

The facts alleged by Plaintiff Lockerman that establish that she was treated disparately \nthan her male colleagues, are typical of, and consistent with, the claims of the other nine (9) \nCRPs. \n1447.  As a direct and proximate cause of the hostile work environment fostered by Defendant, \nPlaintiff Lockerman was humiliated, embarrassed and made to endure constant stress and \nanxiety, depression, lack of sleep and other symptoms that caused her severe mental anguish.   \n1448.

Code § 1-615-51 \net seq., Defendants are prohibited from reassigning, terminating or otherwise retaliating against a \nD.C. government employee as a result of that employee’s protected disclosures that the employee \nreasonably believes show gross mismanagement, gross misuse or waste of government resources, \nand abuse of authority in the connection with the administration of a government program, or a \nviolation of a state, local or federal law, rule or regulation.  \n1452.  Plaintiff Lockerman was an employee who, as a result of her disclosures to her supervisors, \nthe senior leadership of her department, the EEO Department of the MPD, Assistant Chief Caron, \nChief Newsham, the District of Columbia City Council, the Office of the Mayor and the EEOC \n190 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 191 of 208\n \nabout the systemic discrimination in the MPD, and the complicity of the MPD EEO Department \nin perpetuating it and protecting those who engage in it, ethical violations that included leaking \nconfidential  witness  statements,  the  creation  of  a  chilling  and  retaliatory  work  culture  that \ndiscouraged officers from complaining about mistreatment and inappropriate police conduct, \nenjoyed the protection of DCWPA.  \n1453.  As  a  direct  result  of  Plaintiff  Lockerman’s  protected  disclosures,  Defendants \nsystematically  and  continuously  retaliated  against  Plaintiff,  including  but  not  limited  to \nunwarranted  disciplinary  actions  against  Plaintiff,  isolation  and  separation  from  coworkers, \nunfavorable  treatment  and  assignments,  false  and  inaccurate  performance  evaluation  and \nultimately termination. \n1454.

Plaintiff  Lockerman  has  incurred  lost  wages,  loss  of  reputation  and  loss  of  career \nopportunity now and into the future, and all the other losses stated herein. \n1457.  Plaintiff Lockerman herein seeks compensatory damages, and damages for mental pain and \nsuffering of not less than $500,000.00, plus interest, costs, fees and all other remedies the Court \ndeems appropriate. \n \n \n \n191 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 192 of 208\n \n PLAINTIFF MITCHELL’S INDIVIDUAL CLAIMS \nFacts Relevant to Plaintiff Mitchell’s Individual Claims \n1458.  Plaintiff Mitchell was first employed by MPD in September of 1985.  She retired from the \nMPD with 29.5 years of service, on or about March 16, 2015. \n1459.  In 2017, she was asked to come out of retirement and return to the MPD as a Senior Police \nOfficers (“SPO”). \n1460.  She was assigned to partner with Officer Sinobia Brinkley, whom she had partnered with \nfor more twenty (20) years when they were both sworn officers. Officer Brinley (hereinafter \n“Plaintiff Brinkley”) is a CRP in this matter.  \n1461.  At the time Plaintiff Mitchell returned to the ERT Department, Lieutenant Kevin O’Bryant \n(hereinafter “Sgt. O’Bryant”) was still her manager, but was preparing to retire. \n1462.  On her first day on the job, Sergeant Michael Boyd (hereinafter “Sgt. Boyd”) asked \nPlaintiff Mitchell and Plaintiff Brinkley to meet him in a conference room. \n1463.  When Plaintiffs Mitchell and Brinkley got there, Sgt. Boyd and Detective Elisa Brown \n(hereinafter “Det. Brown”) gave them the insight on the new ERT, which had experienced turnover \nsince they had retired, emphasizing whom the Plaintiffs should avoid and not to trust because there \nwas a “New Sheriff” in town.      \n1464.  Plaintiffs Mitchell and Brinkley took this as a warning that then Chief of Police Cathy \nLanier operated very differently than her predecessor.  \n1465.  Plaintiffs Mitchell and Brinkley were baffled by the meeting and the warning because they \ndid not work directly for Sgt. Boyd or Det. Brown, and could not fathom their motivation behind \nthis private warning. \n192 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 193 of 208\n \n1466.  Sgt. Boyd was responsible for issuing Plaintiffs Mitchell and Brinkley the cruiser they \nwould be using for their day-to-day work.    \n1467.  When they went to the lot to retrieve their vehicles, they were surprised to see that the \nvehicles were two old K-9 cruisers, with the dog cages and other parts stuffed in the trunk.   \n1468.  The cars assigned to Plaintiffs had interiors that were covered in dog hair and dander that \nwas getting all over their uniforms, along with numerous spiders and insects because the cars had \nbeen sitting idle for months.     \n1469.  Since Plaintiffs Mitchell and Brinkley had to be immediately available for all barricades \nand high-risk warrants, they tried to make the best of it.    \n1470.  Plaintiffs Mitchell and Brinkley both asked that the vehicles be sent to the MPD shop for \ndetailing.  \n1471.  Plaintiff Mitchell was able to drive her car to the vehicle cleaning area, but Plaintiff \nBrinkley’s vehicle had to be towed because the engine was dead.   \n1472.  A few days later, Plaintiffs Brinkley and Mitchell were informed that they needed to be on \na high-risk detail.    \n1473.  On many of these warrant details, the officers spend a great deal of time inside their \nvehicles, waiting for the “go ahead” to approach a person or structure.   \n1474.  When Plaintiffs Mitchell and Brinkley received their vehicles back from the cleaning \nservice, the cars were not actually cleaned, but there were several containers of the insecticide that \nwas used to kill the spiders and other insects in the back of the vehicles. \n1475.  The insecticide killed the spiders, but it did not kill the fleas, which were still clearly visible \nand moving around the vehicle. \n193 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 194 of 208\n \n1476.  At first, Plaintiffs Mitchell and Brinkley went to Sgt. Boyd to obtain different vehicles, \nsince there were other vehicles available.  Sgt. Boyd refused to assign them different vehicles. \n1477.  Perplexed by Sgt. Boyd’s refusal, Plaintiffs Mitchell and Brinkley went to Sgt. Boyd’s \nsuperior, Lieutenant Kenny Taylor (hereinafter “Lt. Taylor”) to get assigned clean vehicles.  Lt. \nTaylor also denied their request.    \n1478.  It  bears  repeating  that  there  were  multiple  clean,  operational  vehicles  available  for \nPlaintiffs Brinkley and Mitchell to use.  \n1479.  Plaintiffs Mitchell and Brinkley then requested a meeting with the (then) Commander \nGuillermo Rivera (hereinafter “Cdr. Rivera”) who seemed very irritated that Plaintiffs had to come \nto him with such a petty issue.    \n1480.  He stated: “This a no-brainer,” or words to that effect, and  several days later, Plaintiffs \nMitchell and Brinkley were issued new suitable trucks. \n1481.  Until the new vehicles arrived, Plaintiffs Mitchell and Brinkley were given permission by \nLt. Taylor to use a white Suburban Truck. \n1482.  When Sgt. Boyd realized that Plaintiffs Mitchell and Brinkley were using that Suburban \n(with Lt. Taylor’s permission), he called Plaintiff Mitchell’s phone and began to berate her for \ntaking this vehicle without his permission. \n1483.  Plaintiff Mitchell attempted to explain to Sgt. Boyd that Lt. Taylor had given her and her \npartner permission to use the vehicle.   \n1484.  Sgt. Boyd stated he did not care who gave Plaintiff Mitchell permission. Sgt. Boyd asserted \nthat he didn’t want Plaintiff Mitchell to drive the Suburban.  He gave no reason or explanation for \nhis adamant and illogical position. \n194 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 195 of 208\n \n1485.  Sgt.  Boyd  was  screaming  at  Plaintiff  Mitchell  in  a  very  loud,  disrespectful  and \ncondescending tone.     \n1486.  Plaintiff Mitchell then notified Lt. Taylor to complain about the way Sgt. Boyd spoke to \nher and handled the situation.     \n1487.  From that point forward, Sgt. Boyd had personal animus against Plaintiff Mitchell, and \nacted to retaliate against her. \n1488.  In June of 2017, Plaintiff Mitchell was assigned to assist with a high-risk warrant, and to \ngo on a drive-by detail with five (5) other tactical officers, as well as a Sergeant.  Plaintiff was the \nonly female officer assigned to this detail. \n1489.  The other officers were ready before Plaintiff Mitchell arrived at work, and they were \nwaiting for her, while chatting with Sgt. Boyd.    \n1490.  Once Plaintiff Mitchell arrived, she noticed that Officer Eric Watson (hereinafter “Officer \nWatson”) was carrying a unique looking bag.  When she asked what was in it, he responded that \nthere was a drone in the bag. \n1491.  Plaintiff Mitchell was pleasantly surprised, because drones were not available before she \nhad retired from the force.  When Plaintiff Mitchell asked about using official drones, Officer \nWatson admitted it was his personal drone, not one issued by the MPD. \n1492.  Officer Watson indicated that he brought the drone to take arial pictures of the location \nwhere the warrant was to be issued. \n1493.  Apparently, neither Officer Watson nor Sgt Horos, were aware that the area in which the \nwarrant was to be served was designated a no-fly zone for drones by the FAA.     \n195 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 196 of 208\n \n1494.  Officer Watson sent the drone up twice, but eventually, it fell out of the air.  The tracking \ndevice in it indicated it was in the Fort Dupont Park area, so Officer Watson and Sgt. Horos decided \nto go to find it, rather than simply let it be. \n1495.  Plaintiff Mitchell had no power in that situation to do anything but ride along.  Sgt. Horors \nwas the supervisory employee on the team.  \n1496.  Plaintiff Mitchell was texting with Plaintiff Brinkley, who was back at the station and \nwondering what was taking the team so long.   A ride-by typically takes less than an hour.     \n1497.  Plaintiff Mitchell and the rest of the men on the detail were driving around for three hours, \nlooking for the drone.  \n1498.  By that time, several of the male officers needed to urinate so they went in the woods. \n1499.  For some reason, Sgt. Horos decided to take his penis out and urinate in the van into a \nbottle, instead of getting out with the other guys.    \n1500.  Everyone in the van could hear and smell the Sgt. Horos’ urine.  This event made Plaintiff, \nthe only female in the van, very uncomfortable. \n1501.  Plaintiff Mitchell intended to report the urination incident, but she had to attend the funeral \nof a family member of a fellow officer shortly after the ride by was completed. \n1502.  During the funeral, the officers on the ride by team were called back to the station to meet \nwith their Captain. \n1503.  Once they met with Captain  Robert Halbileb (hereinafter “Cpt. Halblieb”), Plaintiff \nMitchell’s  police  powers  were  suspended,  along  with  that  of  the  other  officers,  pending \ninvestigation, even though all officers admitted that she was not the one operating the drone. \n1504.  As mentioned above, Plaintiff had no idea that Officer Watson planned to bring and deploy \nthe drone, and had no idea the area at issue was a no-fly zone for the FAA. \n196 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 197 of 208\n \n1505.  She had just returned to MPD after retirement, and had no idea what MPD policy on the \nuse of drones was. She relied on the fact that Sgt. Horos, who was in the van, and who fully  \nparticipated in deploying the drone, knew what he was doing.   \n1506.  To make matters worse, Sgt. Boyd tried to accuse Plaintiff of Brinkley, who was at the \nstation during the incident, of  being the one who “snitched” on the others for use of the done. \n1507.  In fact, it was Sgt. Boyd himself who saw the other officers charging the drone in the locker \nroom before they left for the ride-by.      \n1508.  The only reason Sgt. Boyd could have for lying about Plaintiff Brinkley and saying that \nshe was the one who reported the others, was to cause Plaintiff Brinkley to be shunned and \nretaliated against by the other officers.   \n1509.  Sgt. Boyd knew or should have known that the drone was illegal, and was aware that the \nofficers who were in the locker room prior to ride by were planning on using it.  \n1510.  Sgt. Boyd but did not warn, or prohibit the other officers from using the drone.    \n1511.  When Plaintiff Mitchell left the Cpt. Hableb’s office, she reported the highly inappropriate \nurinating incident in the van to Sgt. O’Bryant.     \n1512.  Sgt. O’Bryant was shocked, and he notified Lt. Taylor who requested a meeting with \nPlaintiff Mitchell and Sgt. Horos.    \n1513.  Sgt. Horos apologized for his actions, and a few weeks later, he was promoted.   \n1514.  On information and belief, Sgt. Horos was not disciplined in any way for his inappropriate \nbehavior. \n1515.  Despite the fact that he had participated in illegally operating the drone, on information \nand belief, Sgt. Horos did not suffer any serious adverse consequences for failing to lead in that \nsituation. \n197 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 198 of 208\n \n1516.  By contrast, Plaintiff was taken off of regular duties and placed on no-contact duties order, \nable to work only in the station. \n1517.  On or about February 26, 2018, Plaintiff Mitchell was told to go see Capt. Glover.  \n1518.  When she got to Cpt. Glover’s office, Lieutenant Andrew Margiotta (hereinafter “Lt. \nMargiotta”) was also there.  \n1519.  Capt. Glover asked Plaintiff if she had violated her no-contact order by being on-scene at \na barricade.  \n1520.  Plaintiff Mitchell indicated that she had not, and that she had only assisted Plaintiff \nBrinkley in moving equipment into Plaintiff Brinkley’s vehicle. \n1521.  Nevertheless, Cpt. Glover mandated that Plaintiff Mitchell write an incident report and be \ninvestigated for violating the no-contact order.   \n1522.  A thorough investigation was conducted into Plaintiff Mitchell’s whereabouts. Video \nfootage from around the scene was pulled and several officers were interviewed. \n1523.  Eventually, it was concluded that the officer who had reported seeing Plaintiff Mitchell at \nthe barricade, had actually seen Plaintiff Brinkley instead. \n1524.   The investigation, which took weeks of valuable police time, fully exonerated Plaintiff \nMitchell.  \n1525.  When Plaintiff was finally able to confront the officer who had accused her, Sgt. Matthew  \nMahl (hereinafter “Sgt. Mahl”), and asked him why he had falsely accused her, he responded by \nstating “y’all look alike,” or words to that effect.  \n1526.  Sgt. Mahl was not disciplined in any way for making a false report on a fellow officer.  \n1527.  On or about March 27, 2020, while in a meeting with Lt. Robinson and Sgt. John Brown \nregarding Plaintiff Mitchell’s tour of duty with Plaintiff Brinkley, the pair of them were told to \n198 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 199 of 208\n \n“watch the company you keep,” or words to that effect, which indicated that Plaintiff Mitchell was \nunder close scrutiny by management.  \n1528.  A few weeks later Plaintiff caught the coronavirus, and was out of work for eight weeks \nwith COVID. \n1529.  On her first day back to work once she was cleared, Plaintiff attended roll call as usual. \n1530.  That roll call was conducted by Sgt. Luke Foskess, who decided to single out Plaintiff \nMitchell during roll call. \n1531.  Sgt. Foskess took Plaintiff Mitchell’s temperature and asked her if she had any symptoms, \nas per COVID protocols, but Plaintiff Mitchell was just coming back from sick leave and had just \nbeen cleared by a doctor.  \n1532.  Plaintiff Mitchell responded that she had a slight headache because she had not yet eaten  \nanything, but otherwise was fine.  \n1533.  Sgt. Foskess then ordered Plaintiff Mitchell to go to the Police and Firefighters Clinic for \na fitness for duty evaluation.  \n1534.  Rather than being allowed to drive to the clinic herself, an officer was ordered to drive \nPlaintiff Michell to the clinic, which made little sense if Sgt. Foskess was worried that Plaintiff \nMitchell still had COVID-19. \n1535.  Why Plaintiff was seen at clinic, the medical provider asked her why she was there.  When \nPlaintiff Mitchell explained she had not eaten lunch yet that day, and told him that she had a slight \nheadache, he told Plaintiff to go. \n1536.  Plaintiff Mitchell was humiliated by this event, where she was sent to a fitness for duty \nevaluation in front of her colleagues. \n199 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 200 of 208\n \n1537.  There was no reason for Sgt. Foskess to insist that she go for an evaluation, because she \ndid not have a fever and had just been cleared for duty.  \n1538.  Not only did this incident single-out Plaintiff, but it also inconvenienced one of her peers.  \nIt also kept her from doing her job. \n1539.  Thereafter Plaintiff Mitchell and Plaintiff Brinkley continued to be targeted for minor \ndiscipline and investigations. \n1540.  For example, on or about August 28, 2020, Plaintiff Mitchell was working the day shift \ntour during the  March On Washington Detail.    \n1541.  When they reported for their tour, Plaintiff Mitchell and Plaintiff Brinkley were advised by \nSgt. Brown to go to the SOD office and write out a form explaining why they had not been at a \nbarricade the night before.  \n1542.  The reason was that they were not on duty, and there was no general order that all day \nofficers had to be available for night duty. \n1543.  Nevertheless, Plaintiff Mitchell was disciplined for a minor infraction when she had done \nnothing wrong.  \n1544.  On or about May 3, 2020, while working on the scene at a barricade at 3237 Hyatt Place \nNW, Plaintiff received a call that her mother had suffered a seizure and was being transported to \nthe hospital emergency room by ambulance. \n1545.  Plaintiff Mitchell’s mother was admitted to the Critical Care unit of the Washington \nHospital Center.  \n1546.  Plaintiff Mitchell was allowed to stay with her mother in the Critical Care unit to help calm \nand ease her mother because the seizure and other medical issues made her mother non-verbal.   \n1547.  Plaintiff Mitchell was granted three weeks of unpaid FMLA leave.     \n200 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 201 of 208\n \n1548.  However, when she returned to work, she was served with a minor disciplinary action for \nnot being on five barricades that took place while Plaintiff Mitchell was out on approved FMLA \nleave.   \n1549.  To clarify, Plaintiff was not written-up for missing work.  She was written up for missing \nthe barricades themselves.  \n1550.  There is no basis in the law for disciplining someone for missing work assignments while \non FMLA, and no other officers in Plaintiff Mitchell’s unit were disciplined for missing barricades \nwhile on FMLA leave. \n1551.  Plaintiff Mitchell herein asserts that the discipline she received for missing barricades was \nretaliation for taking FMLA leave, and part of a greater scheme to retaliate against her for opposing \nSgt. Horors’ misconduct. \n1552.  Plaintiff Mitchell filed a grievance on the discipline that was issued to her for missing \nbarricades while she was on approved FMLA leave to take care of her very sick mother.  \n1553.  A few weeks after Plaintiff Mitchell returned to work, she was accidentally stung by a bee \nwhile on duty.   She had a severe reaction to the sting and went to the clinic to be seen by a health \ncare provider.    \n1554.  At the clinic, Plaintiff was prescribed an antibiotic and antihistamine.  \n1555.  Plaintiff had a serious systemic reaction to the medication, and had to be off of work for \ntwo weeks to recover.   \n1556.  She was placed on paid FMLA leave while she recuperated. \n1557.  Again, while she was on FMLA leave, Plaintiff Mitchell was disciplined for not making it \nto the barricades that had taken place while she was out.  \n201 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 202 of 208\n \n1558.  Sgt. Brown went to Plaintiff Mitchell’s home to serve her notification of another form of \ndiscipline, while she was still recuperating from her ordeal with the medication.   \n1559.  Plaintiff had to call her Union Steward, Hiram Rosario, and place him on speaker phone in \norder to have Union representation (which she was entitled to) during this meeting. \n1560.  Sgt. Brown stated he did not agree with the discipline, however he was directed by his \nsuperiors to handle it.      \n1561.  It bears repeating that Plaintiff was on approved medical leave when she missed the \nbarricades that were the subject of her discipline.  \n1562.  On information and belief, no other officers in SOD have been written up for missing \nbarricades or other assignments while on approved FMLA leave.  \n1563.  On or around January 17, 2021,  during the days leading up to the inauguration of President  \nBiden, Plaintiff Mitchell was detailed to a joint operations center in Herndon, VA, which is more \nthan an hour and a half drive, each way, for Plaintiff Mitchell. \n1564.  At the time, Plaintiff Mitchell’s supervisors were well aware that she was the sole caregiver \nfor her mother, who had suffered a stroke, and had had several seizures.   \n1565.  In order to have the time to care for her mother, ensure that her mother was fed during the \nday and that she was comfortable, Plaintiff requested 4 hours of intermitted leave each day of the \n12-hour shift (6am -6pm), so she could have time to drive back and forth to Herndon and still care \nfor her mother. \n1566.  Plaintiff Mitchell’s request was denied.  The reason she was given was because a different \nagency was paying for her time. \n1567.  Luckily, Officer Wendell Cunningham (hereinafter “Officer Cunningham”) volunteered to \nwork the extra 4 hours to cover for Plaintiff so she could care for her mother. \n202 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 203 of 208\n \n1568.  While this may seem like an innocuous incident, Plaintiff Mitchell had very few options \nwhen it came to caring for her ailing mother because her mother is non-verbal, and cannot \ncommunicate well with hired caregivers. \n1569.  The anxiety and stress that Plaintiff Mitchell endured in trying to work out how she could \nfulfill her duties and still care for her mother was all-consuming. \n1570.  Had she not been assisted by Officer Cunningham, Plaintiff Mitchell would have likely \nquit her job, rather than allow her mother to go without care. \n1571.  There was no reason for Plaintiff Mitchell to have been put through that sort of stress, \nbecause the joint operations role Plaintiff Mitchell was fulfilling was actually designated for a \nmanagement-level officer, as explained in the emails from Captain Caron and Lt. Robinson. \n1572.  This incident was another example of the disregard and disparate treatment that Plaintiff \nMitchell endures on the job. \n1573.  Plaintiff Mitchell has endured so many small incidents of unfairness and negative treatment \nthat she has opted to retire from MPD, rather than continue in such a toxic environment.  \n1574.  Her last day on the job will be September 24, 2021. \n  Plaintiff Mitchell’s Individual Causes of Action \n      Race Discrimination and Retaliation Claims \n1575.  Plaintiff Mitchell incorporates and restates all of the previous factual allegations \ncontained in this Complaint as if fully restated herein. \n1576.

Plaintiff Mitchell was treated disparately, subjected to a hostile work environment and \nretaliated against for complaining about and opposing the race discrimination to which she was \nsubjected.  \n1578.  The facts alleged above, if proven, constitute discrimination, and systematic retaliation \nsevere and pervasive enough to be compensable. \n1579.  The facts alleged above, taken in conjunction with the facts alleged by the other nine (9) \nCRPs, establish that Defendant maintained a pattern, practice and custom of race discrimination \nagainst Black women police officers on the basis of race.  \n1580.

Plaintiff Mitchell incorporates and restates all of the previous factual allegations \ncontained in this Complaint as if fully restated herein. \n1585.  Plaintiff Mitchell, on her own behalf, asserts herein claims pursuant to Title VII of the Civil \nRights Act of 1964, as amended, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e, et seq., and the District of Columbia Human \nRights Act, District of Columbia Code § 2-1401.01 et seq. \n1586.  Plaintiff Mitchell was treated disparately, subjected to a hostile work environment and \nretaliated against for complaining about and opposing the gender discrimination she was \nsubjected to.  \n1587.  The facts alleged above, if proven, constitute discrimination, and systematic retaliation \nsevere and pervasive enough to be compensable. \n1588.  The facts alleged above, taken in conjunction with the facts alleged by the other nine (9) \nCRPs, establish that Defendant maintained a pattern and practice of race discrimination against \nBlack women police officers on the basis of sex.  \n1589.  The facts alleged by Plaintiff Mitchell that establish that she was treated disparately than \nher male colleagues are typical of, and consistent with, the claims of the other nine (9) CRPs. \n1590.  As a direct and proximate cause of the hostile work environment fostered by Defendant, \nPlaintiff Mitchell was humiliated, embarrassed and made to endure constant stress and anxiety, \ndepression, lack of sleep and other symptoms that caused her severe mental anguish.   \n1591.  Plaintiff Mitchell has incurred lost wages, loss of reputation and loss of career opportunity \nnow and into the future, and all the other losses stated herein. \n205 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 206 of 208\n \n1592.  Plaintiff Mitchell seeks compensatory damages, and damages for mental pain and \nsuffering, above and beyond recovery as a member of the class, of not less than $250,000.00, \nplus interest, costs, fees and all other remedies the Court deems appropriate. \n    Whistleblower Retaliation Claim \n1593.  Plaintiff Mitchell incorporates and restates all information and allegations contained in \nthe preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n1594.  Pursuant to the District of Columbia Whistleblower Protection Act D.C. Code § 1-615-51 \net seq., Defendants are prohibited from reassigning, terminating or otherwise retaliating against a \nD.C. government employee as a result of that employee’s protected disclosures that the employee \nreasonably believes show gross mismanagement, gross misuse or waste of government resources, \nand abuse of authority in the connection with the administration of a government program, or a \nviolation of a state, local or federal law, rule or regulation.  \n1595.

As a direct result of Plaintiff Mitchell’s protected disclosures, Defendants systematically \nand continuously retaliated against Plaintiff, including but not limited to unwarranted disciplinary \n206 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 9   Filed 09/22/21   Page 207 of 208\n \nactions against Plaintiff Mitchell, isolation and separation from coworkers, unfavorable treatment \nand assignments, false and inaccurate performance evaluation and ultimately termination. \n1597.  As a result of Defendants’ actions, Plaintiff Mitchell suffered significant economic harm \nin the form of loss of employment, corresponding salary, loss of employment opportunities, \ndamage to her professional reputation, and significant mental and emotional distress. \n1598.  Plaintiff Mitchell was humiliated, embarrassed and made to endure constant stress and \nanxiety, depression, lack of sleep and other symptoms that required her to seek professional \ntreatment, and that materially caused her severe mental anguish. \n1599.  Plaintiff Mitchell has incurred lost wages, loss of reputation and loss of career opportunity \nnow and into the future, and all the other losses stated herein. \n1600.  Plaintiff Mitchell herein seeks compensatory damages, and damages for mental pain and \nsuffering of not less than $500,000.00, plus interest, costs, fees, and all other remedies the Court \ndeems appropriate. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \n \n  WHEREFORE,  Plaintiffs  individually  respectfully  pray  that  this  Honorable  Court \nORDER that Defendant: \na.

Brinkley (hereinafter “Plaintiff Brinkley”); Tiara \nBrown (hereinafter “Plaintiff Brown”); Karen Carr (hereinafter “Plaintiff Carr”); Leslie Clark \n(hereinafter “Plaintiff Clark”); Chanel Dickerson (hereinafter “Plaintiff Dickerson”); Regenna \nGrier  (hereinafter  “Plaintiff  Grier”);  Tamika  Hampton  (hereinafter  “Plaintiff  Hampton”); \nTabatha Knight (hereinafter “Plaintiff Knight”); LaShaun Lockerman (hereinafter “Plaintiff \nLockerman”), and Kia Mitchell (hereinafter “Plaintiff Mitchell”), collectively hereinafter “the \nClass Representative Plaintiffs” or “CRPs”, by and through undersigned counsel, with their \nAMENDED COMPLAINT against Defendant the District of Columbia (hereinafter “DC” or \n“Defendant”) Metropolitan Police Department (hereinafter “MPD”). \nPlaintiffs are a group of African American (hereinafter “Black”) female police officers. All \nPlaintiffs, except Plaintiff Brown, have served the District of Columbia government as law \nenforcement officers for more than fifteen (15) years. Plaintiff Brown served the District of \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 2 of 219\n \nColumbia for five (5) years and was honored as MPD Officer of the Year during her tenure. Their \ncontributions to the police force and experience on the job have been assets to the MPD for more \nthan 100 years combined. Sadly, each Class Representative Plaintiff has had to endure the \nvictimization of an MPD enterprise-wide culture of race and sex discrimination and intense  \npervasive retaliation against those who dared to complain about, report or oppose unlawful \ndiscrimination. \n  In this case, every Class Representative Plaintiff has complained multiple times about \nunfair treatment on the basis of their race and gender to either the Department’s EEO officials \nand/or their managers, to no avail.  They come together as a class here to describe how the MPD \nhas, for decades, treated Black women police officers with contempt, to the point of systematic \npsychological abuse.  As is often the case, the abuse is often not visible by looking at one person, \nor one incident. There are four fundamental characteristics of the MPD that this class action lawsuit \nseeks to change: 1) MPD has a male-dominated culture that accepts and perpetuates the most \ndemeaning, degrading and disrespectful discourse and actions by and between officers; 2) MPD \nhas a culture that nurtures and encourages supervisory and management officers to abuse their \npower to exact petty vengeance on subordinates and make their lives miserable; 3) MPD has a \nprofoundly dysfunctional and corrupt EEO Office run by a man who has repeatedly expressed \nhostility to women officers, and who colludes with management to crush Black women who \ncomplain about race and gender discrimination and sexual harassment; and 4) MPD, with the full \nparticipation and/or approval of the Chiefs of Police, engages in repeated, coordinated and \nrelentless retaliation campaigns against Black women officers who complain about or oppose \ndiscrimination, or other police misconduct.  In combination, these four MPD characteristics create \na profoundly toxic work environment for Black woman officers.   \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 3 of 219\n \n This lawsuit seeks to ensure that MPD’s discriminatory practices are eradicated for current \nand future Black women police officers, and to obtain full redress for Class Representative \nPlaintiffs and the class members who have been harmed by MPD’s consistent system-wide pattern, \npractice, and custom of race and gender discrimination and retaliation, and maintenance of a toxic \nand hostile work environment for Black women officers. \nPARTIES \n                                                                   THE CLASS \n1.  Plaintiffs seek to represent a class, broken into sub-classes as deemed appropriate by this \nCourt after appropriate pre-class certification discovery, of all Black women police officers \nemployed by the MPD between January 1, 2011, and the present.   \n2.  On information and belief, the class will potentially consist of more than seven hundred \n(700) current and former Black women police officers, broken down into management officers, \nbargaining unit officers, Senior Police Officers, and academy cadets.   \n3.  All class members were subject to the direct authority of the respective present and past \nChiefs of Police, governed by universally applicable MPD policies and practices.  \n      THE CLASS REPRESENTATIVE PLAINTIFFS \n4.  The individual Class Representative Plaintiffs (hereinafter “Plaintiffs” or “CRPs”) are ten \n(10) Black women police officers who are, or were recently, employed by the MPD.   \n  A.

Defendant District of Columbia (hereinafter “DC”) is a municipality governed by Mayor \nMuriel Bowser and the City Counsel of the District of Columbia.  The DC Metropolitan Police \nDepartment (hereinafter “MPD” ) is a DC government law enforcement agency and department.  \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n16.  This Honorable Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331 as it \nasserts claims that arise under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States, specifically \nTitle VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e, et seq., (‘Title VII”), \nDistrict of Columbia Human Rights Act, District of Columbia Code § 2-1401.01 et seq., The Civil \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 6 of 219\n \nRights Act of 1866, 42 U.S.C. § 1981(a), 42 U.S.C. 1981 by way and through 42 U.S.C. § 1983, \nthe  Age  Discrimination  in  Employment  Act,  29  U.S.C.  §§  621-634,  the  Americans  with \nDisabilities Act of 1967, 42 U.S.C. 126, § 12101 et seq., the District of Columbia Whistleblower \nProtection Act, District of Columbia Code § 1-615-51, et seq., Family and Medical Leave Act of \n1993, 29 U.S.C. §§2601 et seq., and the District of Columbia Family and Medical Leave Act \n(DCFMA), D.C. Code §§ 32-501, et seq., and any potential pendant tort claims against the District \nof Columbia for negligent supervision.   \n17.  Venue is proper in the District of Columbia under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 and 29 U.S.C. § 1402 \nbecause substantially all the acts and omissions that give rise to this complaint occurred in the \nDistrict of Columbia.  Venue properly lies within this Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391 and 42 \nU.S.C. § 2000e-5(f)(3).  This Court is also the proper venue to adjudicate Plaintiffs’ pendant state \nlaw claims. \nFACTS RELEVANT TO ALL CLASS MEMBERS \nTHE MPD STRUCTURE AND CULTURE  \nMPD’S CENTRALIZED TOP-DOWN POWER HIERARCHY  \n18.  Much like the military, the MPD has a strict hierarchical decision-making structure and \nrigid chain of command.  While each level of leader in the hierarchy is granted some authority \nover day-to-day activities or routine police matters, the ultimate decision-maker on all police \nmatters is the Chief of Police. \n19.  The Chief of Police maintains a degree of supervision over the Department’s various \nmanagers and its Equal Employment Office, and  accessibility to all MPD employees who are able \nto speak directly to him or her upon request and appointment. \n20.  There are seven (7) classes of employees at MPD: \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 7 of 219\n \na.  Probationary cadets: persons hired via the police academy who are in their training \nphase, and are subject to discharge with little recourse other than through the EEOC charge \nprocess. \nb.  Probationary civilians: persons hired for civilian positions, and who have been \nemployed for less than one year.  They can be terminated without cause within the \nprobationary period with little recourse other than through the EEOC charge process.  \nc.  Sworn Bargaining Unit officers: officers who are full members of the Fraternal \nOrder of Police, Lodge #1, and benefit from all terms and conditions of employment \ncontained in the Collective Bargaining Agreement (hereinafter “CBA”), including just \ncause termination and the right to grieve any disciplinary action. \nd.  Civilian  employees:  persons  who  are  governed  by  the  District  of  Columbia \nemployee manual terms. \ne.  Senior Police Officers (hereinafter “SPO’s”):  retired officers who have been asked \nto come back to the MPD as full-time officers, but not as bargaining unit members.  SPO’s \ncan receive the assistance of a union representative, but are not subject to just cause \ntermination protections in the CBA. \nf.  Management-Level Sworn Officers:  officers with the rank of Lieutenant or Captain \nor Inspector.   \ng.  Executives: senior civil service civilians, and sworn officers with the rank of \nCommander, Assistant Chief (broken into three levels), or Chief. \n21.  The MPD is divided into administrative departments, specialized units, and geographically \ndelineated patrol districts. For example, the MPD has an administrative unit responsible for \ninvestigating all officer-involved traffic accidents, regardless of district or unit.   \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 8 of 219\n \n22.  It also has operational units, some of which are patrol and community based, others of \nwhich are specialized units such as SWAT Team or Harbor Patrol.  The operational functions are \nbroken down into Departments.  The Departments are made up of Bureaus, and the Bureaus are \nbroken down into separate Divisions.  \n23.  Each  Department  is  overseen  by  a  Bureau  Chief.    With  respect  to  policing  of  the \ncommunity through patrol district, each district has one Commander, a few Captains (the number \nof which varies by district), Lieutenants and Sergeants. \n24.  MPD Sergeants have the authority to set employee schedules, make daily assignments, \ndetermine  partnership  arrangements,  monitor  and  supervise  officer  conduct,  track  officer \nmovements and account for their activities, grant or deny requests for up to eight (8) hours of leave, \napprove  or  assign  overtime  work,  verify  time  sheets,  provide  content  and  input  to  officer \nperformance evaluations, and assign officers vehicles and equipment. \n25.  MPD Lieutenants have supervisory authority over Sergeants and serve as the first level of \ndispute management when officers have concerns or problems with the decisions of their district \nSergeants.  Lieutenants ensure that departmental operational goals are met, are responsible for \nofficer evaluations and minor discipline, and have significant input into what officers will be \nassigned to their department.  Lieutenants have the absolute authority to override the decisions of \ntheir subordinate Sergeants. \n26.  While minor disciplinary matters can be handled by Sergeants or Lieutenants, the authority \nto enact major discipline such as suspensions or terminations rests with the Chief of Police and is \ndelegated to the Internal Affairs Bureau, but can be overridden by the Chief of Police at any time. \n27.  Regardless of the authority delegated to subordinates, the Chief of Police retains total \ndiscretion to override the decisions of his or her subordinates. He or she also enjoy the authority \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 9 of 219\n \nto order any of his or her subordinates to carry out his or her wishes with respect to any employee \nof the MPD. \n28.  The MPD maintains one centralized EEO office for all personnel, whether civilian, SPO, \nsworn officer or management. This is the office that handles all internal complaints regarding \nunfair or discriminatory treatment. In theory, it is supposed to investigate, mediate, and address \nequal opportunity concerns.  \n29.  All bargaining unit members are subject to the same pay, promotion, assignment, and \ndisciplinary procedures as negotiated by the Union and outlined in the Collective Bargaining \nAgreement.  \n  MPD’S  CULTURE  OF  ALLOWING  AND  ENCOURAGING  FRONT-LINE \nSUPERVISORY ABUSE OF POWER  \n \n30.  The majority of day-to-day operational decisions are made by district Sergeants and \nLieutenants. This gives them the ability to make decisions that make an officer’s work pleasant, \nor very unpleasant. \n31.  Sergeants and Lieutenants also have the authority and responsibility to rate officers’ \nperformance, which has a direct impact on their promotability and job security. They set the tone \nfor their officers during regular meetings, such as roll call (a regularly scheduled meeting of all \nofficers on a shift to discuss daily assignments). \n32.  For the duration of the relevant period, the MPD has been aware that its Sergeants and \nLieutenants have used their power to abuse, harass, isolate, intimidate, bully and denigrate Black \nwomen police officers.  See., e.g., factual narratives of Plaintiffs Brown, Knight, Hampton, Grier. \n33.  In many instances when MPD leadership has been informed that a Sergeant or Lieutenant  \ntargeted a Black women officer for abuse which resulted in discrimination, MPD management \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 10 of 219\n \nchose to ignore or encourage that abuse.  See., e.g., factual narratives of Plaintiffs Carr, Clark, \nKnight, Hampton.  \n34.  MPD management maintains a pattern and practice of refusing to transfer Black female \nofficers who’ve asked to be transferred away from an abusive supervisor.  See., e.g., factual \nnarratives herein of Plaintiff Lockerman and Hampton. \n35.  MPD’s highest management maintains a pattern, practice and/or custom of refusing to \ncounsel or discipline supervisors who make or condoned sexist, racist, harassing or inappropriately \nsexualized comments.  See., e.g., factual narratives of Plaintiffs Brinkley, Mitchell, and Grier. \n36.  MPD’s highest management maintains a pattern and practice and/or custom of allowing \nand encouraging supervisors to retaliate against Black women officers who’ve complained about \nthe treatment they received by giving them undesirable assignments, assigning them inferior \nequipment, refusing overtime, refusing to give them desirable work schedules, denying them \ntraining opportunities, imposing disparate disciplinary standards, and falsely and inappropriately \nlowering  their  performance  evaluations.    See.,  e.g.,  factual  narratives  below  of  Plaintiffs \nDickerson, Clark, Mitchell, Knight. \n37.  MPD’s highest management maintains a pattern and practice and/or custom of allowing \nsupervisors to use the minor infraction disciplinary process to hyper-scrutinize, harass and attack \nBlack women officers in an effort to demoralize them and make them suffer for having opposed \nor complained about race or gender discrimination. See., e.g., factual narratives below of Plaintiffs \nHampton, Brinkley, Carr, Clark, and Grier. \n38.  MPD’s highest management maintains a pattern and practice and/or custom of refusing to \ninvestigate or act upon complaints of Black women officers who seek redress for discrimination, \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 11 of 219\n \nunfair and disparate treatment, and retaliation by their supervisors.  See., e.g., factual narratives \nbelow of Plaintiffs Dickerson, Knight, Carr, Brinkley, and Lockerman. \n39.  All CRPs have suffered from, and have complained to management about the MPD’s \nculture and practice of allowing supervisors to abuse, attack, bully, harass, discriminate and \nretaliate against them.  \n40.  The requested class relief herein includes: appropriate compensation to class victims and \ncorresponding declaratory and injunctive relief that remedies the MPD’s culture, pattern practice \nand/or  custom  of  allowing  supervisory  employees  to  abuse  their  power  with  impunity  for \nvindictive, petty, racist, sexist, and retaliatory reasons. \n41.  MPD’s culture of allowing the abuse of power of MPD officials to go unchecked has had \na statistically significant disparate impact on Black women officers, and has also caused them to \nsuffer from pervasive disparate treatment.  \nTHE MPD’S SYSTEMATIC EEO PROBLEMS \nMPD’S DYSFUNCTIONAL AND CHILLING EEO OFFICE \n42.  Upon information and belief, Alphonso Lee(hereinafter “Mr. Lee”), Director of the MPD \nEEO Office, has held his position since 2017. \n43.  Between December of 2020 and June of 2021, the EEO Office was managed by Mr. Lee, \nand three (3) subordinate EEO Counselors: Doreen Haines (hereinafter “Ms. Haines”); Rosemarie \nLucero (hereinafter “Ms. Lucero”); and Renae Lee (hereinafter “Ms. Lee”).  All three of these \nEEO Counselors have made internal complaints against Mr. Lee. \n44.  In the Spring of 2021, David Simmons (hereinafter “Mr. Simmons”) (white male) joined \nthe office as an EEO Counselor.    \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 12 of 219\n \n45.  Between February and December of 2020, Harry Carter (hereinafter “Mr. Carter”) was an \nEEO Counselor.   \n46.  The sworn affidavits of Ms. Rosemarie Lucero, Harry Carter, Renae Lee and David \nSimmons, four of the five people who have worked for Mr. Lee, are attached here to as EXHIBITS \n1-4, respectively.  They explain in detail how the MPD EEO Office  operated during their \nrespective tenures, and reveal through sworn affirmations the extent and nature of its corruption \nand dysfunction.  \n47.  During  his  tenure  as  MPD’s  EEO  Director,  Mr.  Lee  has  maintained  a  system  that \nintentionally  discredits  Black  women  complainants,  effectuates  a  pattern  and  practice  of \nretaliation, and bullies his subordinates into disavowing any and all claims of discrimination filed \nby Black women officers, thereby resulting in the Defendant’s sanctioning of discriminatory \npractices against Plaintiffs.  \n48.  As attested by Ms. Lucero in her affidavit, included as EXHIBIT 1, Mr. Lee holds and \nexpresses denigrating views about female police officers in general, and Black female police \nofficers. \n49.  Mr. Lee has repeatedly expressed to his staff his belief that female complainants are “liars” \nand “lazy,” and that they make EEO complaints to be manipulative.  See EXHIBIT 1 & 2. \n50.  Mr. Lee has made his views, which demonstrate sexist and racist behaviors, known to his \nsubordinates so frequently that they refer to it as his “mantra.”  See EXHIBITS 1 & 2. \n51.  Upon information and belief, in the course of four years, Mr. Lee has not permitted a single \nclaim of race or gender discrimination filed in his office to be substantiated.  Emphasis added. See \nEXHIBITS 1-4. \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 13 of 219\n \n52.  As can be seen in Mr. Carter, Ms. Lee’s and Ms. Lucero’s affidavits, Mr. Lee believes, and \nhas repeatedly stated that MPD is not subject to federal equal employment and non-discrimination \nlaws.  See EXHIBITS 1-4. \n53.  Mr. Lee demands that his subordinates report to him what EEO complainants have said in \ninitial interviews, and then goes to management himself, to coordinate what the management \nresponse will be prior to the commencement of any investigation. See EXHIBITS 1-4. \n54.  Mr. Lee required that EEO Counselors record all initial interviews, and then provided and \nor played these recordings for Assistant Chief Manlapaz (hereinafter “Asst. Chief Manlapaz”), the \nBureau Head of IAD, and/or other management personnel.  See EXHIBITS 1 & 2. \n55.  According  to  Mr.  Carter  and  Ms.  Lucero,  this  practice  of  playing  recordings  for \nmanagement contributed directly to immediate retaliation against complainants, and the pervasive \nperception that EEO interviews and complaints were not confidential.  See EXHIBITS 1 & 2, and \nsee., e.g., factual narratives of Plaintiffs Brinkley, Hampton. \n56.  Mr. Lee’s habit of violating confidentiality is a pattern, practice and/or custom designed to \ndiscourage Black woman police officers from using the EEO office and has succeeded in doing \nso.   \n57.  Mr. Lee demands that his subordinates investigate, not with an impartial eye to ascertain \nthe truth, but with an agenda to find facts that will undermine complainants’ claims as well as their \ncredibility.  See EXHIBITS 1-4.  In doing so, he directs his subordinates to place statements in \ninvestigative reports to paint complainants in a negative light. See EXHIBITS 1 & 2.  \n58.  Mr. Lee edited and manipulated written reports, exit letters and other documents that are \nsupposed to reflect the issues raised by a complainant, to ensure that the DC Office of Human \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 14 of 219\n \nRights (hereinafter “OHR”), or the EEOC was misled about what it should be investigating.  See \nEXHIBITS 1 & 2, and see., e.g., below factual narrative of Plaintiff Knight. \n59.  Mr. Lee’s actions were maliciously designed to derail the ability of complainants to obtain \nredress from external entities.  \n60.  Mr.  Lee  worked  with  MPD  management  to  coordinate  management  responses  to \nundermine complainants, and to assist in bullying them and/or forcing them out.  See EXHIBITS \n1-4. \n61.  If  Mr.  Lee’s  subordinates  refused  or  push-backed  on  his  demands  to  discredit  a \ncomplainant, he would retaliate against them by threatening their employment or by putting them \non a Performance Improvement Plan (hereinafter “PIP”).  He placed his EEO Counselors Ms. \nLucero and Ms. Haines on PIPs multiple times for frivolous or fictitious reasons in order to coerce \nthem to comply with his unlawful mandates.  See EXHIBITS 1 & 2. \n62.  On information and belief, Mr. Lee maintains an EEO Office so hostile and toxic that every \nwoman who has worked for him has filed a complaint against him, either internally or externally.  \n63.  On one occasion, a subordinate filed an EEO claim against Mr. Lee for screaming at, and \nbullying her.  Mr. Lee, as EEO Director, chose to investigate her complaint against him by self-\ninvestigation, and, not surprisingly, exonerated himself.  See EXHIBITS 1 & 2.  \n64.  This inappropriate exoneration violated MPD EEO policies that require (at least in theory) \nthat complaint investigations be conducted impartially. \n65.  Mr. Lee also maintains an unlawful pattern and practice of threatening to investigate \npersons who file EEO claims.  See EXHIBIT 1.  Among other things, he repeatedly requested Asst. \nChief Manlapaz of IAD to open investigations into complainants as punishment for complaining. \nSee EXHIBITS 1 & 2.  \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 15 of 219\n \n66.  The Mayor’s Office, District of Columbia City Council, OHR, IAD, Office of the Inspector \nGeneral (hereinafter “DC IG”), and the DC Attorney General’s Office have received multiple \ncomplaints and allegations against Mr. Lee and the MPD EEO Office but have either refused to \nacknowledge them, or to heretofore engage in any meaningful action to remedy the entrenched \naforementioned polices, practices and/or customs.  \n67.  Because of the dysfunctional and retaliatory nature of the MPD EEO Office, Black women \nofficers are left with little recourse but to seek assistance from external entities, DC OHR, the \nEEOC, and the DC IG office.  But, as soon as they did so, Mr. Lee ensured that they would become \nvictims of systemic and coordinated retaliatory efforts to bully, harass and force them out of their \nemployment.    \n68.  MPD executive management has received numerous complains about Mr. Lee and has \nrefused to take any action to mitigate his obvious, and systemic pattern of EEO abuses. \n69.  The CRPs have been harmed and affected by Mr. Lee and the MPD EEO Office’s default \ndismissal of their complaints of race and gender discrimination and retaliation complaints in the \nsame or similar way. \n70.  All putative class members (hereinafter “PCMs”) have been negatively affected by the \nunlawful and discriminatory practices of the MPD EEO Office in the same or similar way. \n71.  All PCMs would benefit from a class-wide remedy based on declaratory and injunctive \nrelief to repair the MPD EEO Office and bring it into alignment with federal law, DC human rights \nlaw, EEOC guidance, and industry best practices. \n72.  The corruption and dysfunction of the MPD EEO office contributes to MPD’s maintenance \nof a hostile and toxic work environment for Black women officers. \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 16 of 219\n \n73.  MPD’s maintenance of unlawful and problematic EEO practices and procedures has a \nstatistically significant disparate impact on Black women officers as compared to their peers, and \nalso subjects them to rampant disparate treatment. \n  THE MPD EEO DIRECTOR USES THREATS AND INTIMIDATION TO CHILL \nTHE REPORTING OF DISCRIMINATION AND ABUSE \n \n74.  In furtherance of the MPD EEO Director’s efforts to breach  complainant confidentiality, \nMr. Lee requires his subordinates to sign an over-broad and unlawful non-disclosure agreement \nthat prohibits them from reporting or speaking out against anything that transpires in the EEO \nOffice.  A copy of the MPD EEO NDA is attached hereto as EXHIBIT 5. \n75.  The terms of the NDA extend far beyond confidentiality with respect to specific cases; it \nalso prohibits EEO Counselors from discussing any actions and activities of the EEO Office, \nincluding discriminatory and unlawful actions.  \n76.  Mr. Lee frequently reminds his counselors of its terms, and threatens to terminate them if \nthey report or complain about his actions. See EXHIBITS 1 & 2.  \n77.  Mr. Lee also requires complainants to sign the same over-broad NDA, and threatened them \nwith serious disciplinary action if they speak out about any component of the EEO process.  \n78.  This explains why the EEO Counselors have filed EEOC complaints with respect to the \nway Mr. Lee has treated them, but did not feel at liberty to report what Mr. Lee was doing to Black \nwomen MPD police officers who complained of discrimination.  See EXHIBITS 1 & 3. \n79.  Plaintiffs assert that Mr. Lee’s NDA is per se unlawful and was used to bully and intimidate \nEEO Counselors into complying with his intentional discrimination against Black women police \nofficers. \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 17 of 219\n \n80.  There is no reason why EEO Counselors should be prohibited from speaking to third parties \nsuch  as  lawyers,  City  Council  members,  the  Mayor’s  Office  or  others  about  MPD  EEO \ndiscriminatory “methods and practices.” \n81.  On multiple occasions, the CRPs attempted to speak directly with their supervisors, \nmanagers, and/or senior department leadership about attacks on their credibility and the skewed \nand dishonest conclusions in EEO reports.  See., e.g., factual narratives of Plaintiffs Brinkley, Carr, \nKnight and Grier. \n82.  MPD management, up to and including MPD Chiefs of Police, maintain a pattern and \npractice of ignoring, rebuffing, rebuking, and disbelieving the complaints from Black women \nofficers about the malfeasance of Mr. Lee, which effectively sanctioned his behaviors and nullified \nEEO protections for victims of discrimination.  \n83.  All  PCMs  are  being  harmed  by  Defendant’s  pattern  and  practice  and/or  custom  of \ndiscrimination via Mr. Lee’s threats and coercion of EEO staff. \n84.  All PCMs are harmed by Mr. Lee’s unlawful use of NDAs to chill proper enforcement of \nthe Department’s anti-discrimination laws.  \n85.  All PCMs would obtain a remedy if the Court were to order declaratory and injunctive \nrelief mandating that the MPD EEO Office cease and desist from using over-broad and misleading \nNDAs,  and  threatening  EEO  Counselors  with  termination  should  they  reveal  or  report  \nmalfeasance in the MPD EEO Office. \n \n \n \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 18 of 219\n \nFACTS APPLICABLE TO THE PUTATIVE CLASS RELATED \nTO SYSTEMIC RETALIATION \n \n  THE MPD MAINTAINS A PATTERN AND PRACTICE OF RETALIATORY IAD \nINVESTIGATIONS  OF  BLACK  WOMEN  POLICE  OFFICERS  WHO \nCOMPLAIN  ABOUT  RACE  OR  GENDER  DISCRIMINATION,  OR \nRETALIATION  \n \n86.  For the duration of the relevant period, MPD IAD has used its investigatory power to bully, \nharass and retaliate against Black women officers.  \n87.  On information and belief, and in accordance with Mr. Lee’s repeated admissions, Asst. \nChief Manlapaz has a close personal relationship with Mr. Lee.  See EXHIBITS 1, 2 & 3. \n88.  Whenever  a  complaint  was  made  against  Asst.  Chief  Manlapaz,  Mr.  Lee  chose  to \n“investigate” it personally, and then dismissed the allegation.  See EXHIBIT 1 & 2. \n89.  The converse is also true.  Asst. Chief Manlapaz would “investigate” any and all claims \nagainst Mr. Lee, and dismiss them.  See EXHIBIT 1 & 2.  \n90.  Mr. Lee has repeatedly informed his subordinates of the mutually beneficial arrangement \nhe has with Asst. Chief Manlapaz, going so far as to insist that no allegation against him will ever \nbe substantiated.  See EXHIBIT 1 & 2.  \n91.  Mr. Lee has repeatedly informed his subordinates that he has the power to ask Asst. Chief \nManlapaz to open an investigation into a complainant for no other reason than to taint the \ncomplainant’s credibility.  See EXHIBITS 1 & 2. \n92.  Asst. Chief Manlapaz has maintained a pattern and practice of opening investigations into \nBlack women officers who complain about discrimination, mistreatment or misconduct for the \nexpress purpose of retaliating against them and chilling others from complaining.   \n93.  Asst. Chief Manlapaz has intentionally sabotaged investigations into allegations made by \nBlack women officers to undermine their authority and ability to manage their staff, attack their \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 19 of 219\n \ncredibility, and stymie their ability to obtain redress of serious complains.  See., e.g., factual \nnarrative of Plaintiff Dickerson. \n94.  Because Asst. Chief Manlapaz has principle investigative authority through his role as the \nBureau Chief of IAD, he has the ability to affect officers at every level, in every department of \nMPD. \n95.  Thus, all PCMs were affected by Asst. Chief Manlapaz’ abuse of power, and his pattern \nand practice of retaliating against Black women officers for complaining about discrimination, \nmisconduct, harassment or retaliation.  \n96.  The Chief of Police, the Mayor’s Office, the AG’s Office, the DC City Council, the DC \nIG, and DC OHR have all received complaints about MPD IAD, and Asst. Chief Manlapaz, \ndetailing how he has abused his power as Bureau Chief of IAD, and that he opens frivolous and \nfraudulent investigations into Black women police officers to intimidate and retaliate against them.  \nAll of those complaints were ignored by DC government entities. \n97.  The entire putative class is negatively affected by Defendant’s maintenance of a pattern \nand practice and/or custom of retaliatory investigating via Asst. Chief Manlapaz’s actions.   \n98.  The entire putative class is negatively affected by Defendant’s pattern and practice of \nundermining or refusing to investigate allegations made by Black women police officers via Chief \nManlapaz’s actions. \n99.  All PCMs would obtain redress from a declaratory or injunctive remedy that revamps IAD \nto repair its policies and practices and retrains its agents to cease using their investigative powers \nto retaliate against complainants. \n100.  MPD’s  maintenance  of  corrupted,  discriminatory  and  dysfunctional  Internal  Affairs \nBureau has a statistically significant disparate impact on Black women officers, subjecting them \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 20 of 219\n \nto more frequent and severe discipline as compared to their peers, and also subjects them to \nrampant disparate treatment in terms of discipline imposed upon them, and victimization from the \nmisconduct of others that is allowed to go unchecked. \n101.  MPD’s tolerance and maintenance of a hyper-partisan and discriminatory IAD department \ncontributes significantly to the hostile and toxic work environment for Black women officers at \nMPD. \n  MPD  MAINTAINS  A  PATTERN,  PRACTICE  AND/OR  CUSTOM  OF \nRETALIATING AGAINST BLACK WOMEN COMPLAINANTS BY WAY OF \nINVOLUNTARILY TRANSFERS \n \n102.  Another way in which the Chiefs of Police have used his power to retaliate against Black \nwomen who opposed or reported misconduct was to destabilize their work schedules and remove \nthem from their assignments or departments. \n103.  As mentioned above, MPD has several specialized units that are competitive to be assigned \nto, and are considered “elite” units.   \n104.  Many of these units are within the Special Operations Department (hereinafter “SOD”).  \nThey  include:    K-9  Unit;  Explosive  Ordinance  Division  (hereinafter  “EOD”);  Emergency \nResponse Team (hereinafter “ERT”); SWAT; Search and Rescue Team; Harbor Patrol; Special \nEvents Detail; Presidential and Vice-Presidential Detail; Mounted Police; Motorcycle Police; \nHelicopter Patrol; and Traffic Division. \n105.  MPD Chiefs of Police have removed Black Female officers from their long-standing \nfavorable assignments on nothing more than an accusation of an infraction.  See., e.g., factual \nnarratives of Plaintiffs Knight & Clark. \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 21 of 219\n \n106.  Involuntary transfers can be extremely disruptive to an officer and/or her family.  They can \nlead to significant changes in work shift, vacation and leave schedule, commute, duties, and long-\nstanding partner relationships. \n107.  MPD Chiefs of Police, or their designates, have threatened Black women officers with \ntransfer if they complain about a co-worker or supervisor discriminating against, harassing or \nbullying them.  See., e.g., factual narrative of Plaintiff Dickerson. \n108.  MPD has weaponized the IAD investigative process, using it to threaten and bully officers \ninto compliance with an outcome desired by the Chief of Police, or his or her designates.  See., \ne.g., factual narratives of Plaintiffs Brown, Brinkley, Carr, Knight, Dickerson, Hampton. \n109.  The MPD maintains a pattern, practice and/or custom of forcing Black women officers to \nrelinquish desirable assignments in exchange for not being fraudulently and unfairly “investigated” \nby IAD, or otherwise disciplined.  \n110.  Black women have been disproportionately targeted for transfer out of desirable or elite \nunits.  \n111.  When a Black woman is actually cleared of an allegation of misconduct, MPD does not \nimmediately reinstate her to the desirable unit or assignment.  See., e.g., factual narratives of \nPlaintiff Knight & Hampton. \n112.  MPD’s  pattern  and  practice  of  retaliatory  transfer  of  complainants  creates  a  chilled \nenvironment for Black women officers, and discourages them from complaining about race and \ngender discrimination and retaliation.  \n113.  The CRPs have been negatively affected by MPD’s pattern and practice of retaliatory and \nabusive departmental transfer. \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 22 of 219\n \n114.  Because the Chiefs of Police have sole power and discretion to order, or intercede to \nprevent a transfer as described herein, all PCMs are affected by this rampant and harmful \nemployment practice. \n115.  All PCMs will obtain a remedy should this Court order declaratory or injunctive relief and \ntake action to curb the MPD’s long-standing pattern and practice of retaliatory job transfers. \n116.  MPD’s maintenance of unlawful, retaliatory and discriminatory job transfer practices and \nprocedures has a statistically significant disparate impact on Black women officers as compared \nto their peers, making it more difficult for them to make rank or obtain seniority, and also subjects \nthem to rampant disparate treatment. \n117.  Furthermore, MPD’s problematic job transfer policies are part of an employment scheme \nthat creates a hostile and toxic work environment for Black women officers. \nMPD  CHIEFS  OF  POLICE  MAINTAIN  A  PATTERN  AND  PRACTICE  OF \nINSTIGATING, ORDERING, APPROVING AND CONDONING COORDINATED \nDISCIPLINARY CAMPAIGNS TO  PUSH  OUT BLACK  WOMEN OFFICERS \nWHO  OPPOSE  OR  COMPLAIN  ABOUT  RACE  OR  GENDER \nDISCRIMINATION OR MISCONDUCT \n \n118.  MPD Chiefs of Police have final say in the termination of any police officer, or put another \nway, an MPD police officer will not be terminated without the Chief of Police’s direct or indirect \napproval. \n119.  When an MPD Chief of Police decides that he or she no longer wants a Black women \nofficer to be employed by the MPD, the Chief orchestrates and coordinates a campaign to push \nthat officer out. \n120.  The narratives of the CRPs clearly outline how these bullying, harassment and retaliation \ncampaigns are carried out.   \n22 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 23 of 219\n \n121.  Black women officers who are no longer welcome at the MPD because they have opposed \nrace or gender discrimination and retaliation, are hyper-scrutinized (or “bird-dogged”) by their \nimmediate supervisors for every kind of minor issue or transgression, and are made to feel they \nare walking on eggshells.  See., e.g., factual narratives below of Plaintiffs Hampton, Mitchell, \nLockerman, Dickerson, Knight, and Carr. \n122.  This practice is so prevalent and such a part of the culture, that MPD officers have a slang \nterm for it: “being hot.”  When an officer is described as “being hot,” by and amongst other officers, \nit means that the officer has been targeted for reprisal and punitive treatment, and is used as a \nwarning to steer clear of that officer to avoid being collaterally damaged by the intentional \nretaliation aimed at the targeted officer.   \n123.  For the duration of the relevant period, MPD Chiefs of Police have been aware of, and have \ndirected their subordinates to execute campaigns that target an individual officer for removal from \nMPD. \n124.  Black  women  officers  have  been  disproportionately  targeted  for  such  campaigns  of \nbullying,  isolation,  harassment  and  retaliation  for  complaining  about  race  and  gender \ndiscrimination, or for reporting fellow police officers for misconduct.  \n125.  Black women who become the subject of such campaigns are made to feel unwelcome and \nlike second class citizens. \n126.  Black women officers who are no longer welcome at the MPD are, and have been \nrepeatedly  disciplined  to  lower  their  performance  appraisal  rates  and  thereby  justify  their \nterminations.  See., e.g., factual narratives of Plaintiffs Brinkley, Knight. \n23 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 24 of 219\n \n127.  IAD targeted and investigated Black women officers who opposed discrimination or \ncomplained about, or reported, misconduct; these same women have been ignored when they’ve \nsought redress for the coordinated retaliation against them. \n128.  MPD Police Chiefs are extremely effective in fashioning and executing these coordinated \ncampaigns to bully, harass and retaliate against Black women police officers, which causes a \ndisproportionate number of them to resign or retire early. \n129.  Black women who are targeted for retaliatory harassment are falsely accused of serious \nmisconduct and made to defend themselves against often-times outrageous accusations.  When \nthose accusations are proven to be unfounded, there is no redress of any kind.  See., e.g., factual \nnarratives of Plaintiffs Mitchell, Knight, Brown. \n130.  Black women police officers with decades of service to the MPD, once they become the \nsubject of a targeted bullying campaign, are found to be deficient in every category of performance, \nwith no explanation as to what caused the purported dramatic decline in performance.  See e.g., \nSee., e.g., factual narratives of Plaintiffs Brinkley, Mitchell, Clark, Carr, Knight. \n131.  Black women officers who are targeted by the Chiefs of Police in such a fashion are bullied \nand harassed to such an extent that it adversely affects their mental and physical health, and places \nthem in a position in which leaving the MPD becomes the only way in which they can protect their \nmental and physical wellbeing.  See., e.g., factual narratives below of Plaintiffs Dickerson, \nBrinkely, Knight, Carr, Clark, and Brown. \n132.  Because of the complete and total dysfunction of the MPD EEO Office, Black women \nofficers are unable to obtain any kind of internal intervention to help protect their rights. \n133.  Those that obtain the benefit of union  representation  often encounter management’s \nintentional delay(s) and refusal(s) to provide information to the union. \n24 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 25 of 219\n \n134.  When the union is successful in proving that the disciplinary action against a Black woman \nofficer was unjust, days or weeks later, the Black woman officer will be disciplined again for \nsomething else.   \n135.  The design and intention of the coordinated attacks by MPD Chiefs of Police is to make \nBlack women who oppose gender and race discrimination feel as if there is an incessant onslaught \nof harassment and bullying against them, that chokes the life out of their professional competencies \nand emotional strength such that it becomes  easier to simply give up.  MPD Chiefs of Police \napprove of, and use, such tactics for unlawful purposes and disproportionately against Black \nwomen officers. \n136.  MPD Police Chief tactics to push out Black women police officers constitute unlawful \nretaliation. \n137.  All CRPs have been affected by the MPD’s pattern, practice and/or custom of targeted \nharassment  and  bullying  in  retaliation  for  complaining  about  or  opposing  race  and  gender \ndiscrimination and police misconduct. \n138.  Because of MPD’s top-down structure all PCMs are similarly affected by, and equally \nvulnerable to, its pattern, practice and/or custom of coordinated and targeted retaliatory bullying \nof Black women police officers. \n139.  All putative class members would obtain a remedy if the Court were to order declaratory \nand injunctive relief against the MPD, ordering it to cease and desist from engaging in coordinated \nbullying and harassment of Black women officers who oppose race and gender discrimination and \nretaliation.  \n25 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 26 of 219\n \n140.  MPD’s maintenance of unlawful and retaliatory practices has a statistically significant \ndisparate impact on Black women officers as compared to their peers, and also subjects them to \nrampant disparate treatment. \nFACTS COMMON TO THE CLASS RELATED TO MPD’S \nSYSTEMIC DISPARATE TREATMENT OF BLACK WOMEN OFFICERS  \nBASED ON RACE AND GENDER  \n \nMPD  MAINTAINS  A  PATTERN  AND  PRACTICE  OF  INTENTIONALLY \nDENYING PROMOTIONS TO BLACK WOMEN OFFICERS  \n \n141.  MPD’s process for promoting officers up the ranks disproportionately adversely affect \nBlack women police officers. \n142.  On information and belief, Black women are promoted less than any other group at MPD, \nthe disparity is statistically significant, and is the result of practices that amount to both disparate \ntreatment of, and disparate impact on Black women police officers. \n143.  Actual promotions are based on how many openings are available, and the ranking order \nof the results of the officers who took the promotion exam, which is published.  Thus, the highest \nperformer is ranked number one, the second number two, and so forth. \n144.  If, for example, a Department has three Lieutenant openings, in theory the top three \nperformers on the Lieutenant exam would be promoted into those roles. \n145.  However, MPD has maintained a pattern, practice and/or custom of filling openings with \n“Acting Officials” who are favored by the Chief of Police or the Departmental Commander, to \nforeclose or delay the promotion of a Black women officer who earned the promotion because of \nher  performance  on  the  exam.  See.,  e.g.,  factual  narratives  below  of  Plaintiffs  Hampton, \nLockerman, and Dickerson.  Promotion delays adversely affect Black woman officers’ pay and \ncareer development opportunities.  \n26 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 27 of 219\n \n146.  MPD Chiefs of Police have used this practice to harm Black women officers for the \nduration of the relevant period and to retaliate against Black women officers for complaining about \nrace or gender discrimination, and/or other police misconduct. \n147.  Because the Chief of Police has absolute discretion to make such determinations in all \nDepartments, all PCMs who seek promotions are affected by this pattern, practice, and/or custom. \n148.  All PCMs who seek to be promoted would obtain a complete remedy if a declaratory or \ninjunctive remedy was ordered that prohibited or severely restricted the practice of promoting \n“Acting Official” over fully qualified and promotion-eligible Black women police officers.  \n149.  MPD’s maintenance of unfair and disparate promotion practices and procedures has a \nstatistically significant disparate impact on Black women officers as compared to their peers, and \nalso subjects them to rampant disparate treatment. \n  MPD’S  PATTERN,  PRACTICE  AND/OR  CUSTOM  OF  DENYING  BLACK \nWOMEN OFFICERS CAREER DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES \n \n150.  MPD maintains a pattern, practice and/or custom of denying Black women officers the \nability to transfer into elite or desirable specialized units, particularly if they have complained \nabout race or gender discrimination, or have accused an officer of misconduct.  See., e.g., factual \nnarrative below of Plaintiff Carr. \n151.  Several of the MPD’s elite and most desirable units have physical requirements that all \nofficers have to meet. Some of the units administer physical fitness exams that determine who can \nbe assigned to them.  \n152.  MPD maintains a pattern, practice and/or custom of holding back those Black women \nofficers who do pass the physical requirements from transferring into the units they qualify for.   \n27 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 28 of 219\n \n153.  MPD denies these transfers to Black women officers if they are perceived to be “trouble-\nmakers,” i.e., someone who reports or opposes misconduct or discrimination.  See., e.g., factual \nnarratives below of Plaintiffs Knight, Brinkley, Mitchell, Carr, and Grier. \n154.  When Black women officers complain about being denied job opportunities, they are \nfurther retaliated against.   \n155.  Defendant maintains a pattern, practice and/or custom of allowing MPD management to \ndeny transfers and job opportunities to Black women officers without any legitimate explanation \nor business justification for doing so.   \n156.  This MPD policy, practice, and/or custom disproportionately harms Black women officers, \nand affects all PCMs in the same way. \n157.  MPD’s maintenance of unlawful and discriminatory assignment practices and procedures \nhas a statistically significant disparate impact on Black women officers as compared to their peers, \nand also subjects them to rampant disparate treatment. \n158.  MPD’s pattern and practice of discriminatory job assignment practices contribute to the \nmaintenance of hostile and toxic work environment for Black women officers. \n159.  All PCMs would obtain a remedy to a discriminatory and retaliatory practice if the Court \ngranted them declaratory and injunctive relief that requires MPD management to justify or explain \ndenials of requested job transfers to Black women officers when an opening is available. \nMPD  HAS  A  POLICY,  PATTERN  AND  PRACTICE,  AND/OR  CUSTOM  OF \nENFORCING  DISPARATE  DISCIPLINARY  STANDARDS  WHICH  FAVOR \nWHITE MALE OFFICERS \n \n160.  Upon information and belief, to a statistically significant degree, Black women officers are \ndisciplined more frequently, and face harsher punishments than white male officers, black male \nofficers, or white female officers for the same transgressions. \n28 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 29 of 219\n \n161.  Upon information and belief, to a statistically significant degree, Black women officers are \nfrequently disciplined for actions that are not transgressions at all. \n162.  For example, when MPD suspected that Plaintiff Tabatha Knight had been recording some \nof her meetings with supervisors and management to protect herself from the onslaught of false \naccusations made against her, she was subjected to an IAD investigation, and threatened with a \ntwenty-eight (28) day suspension.   \n163.  Plaintiff Knight’s recording of conversations did not violate District of Columbia law, nor  \nMPD policy. \n164.  Rather, Plaintiff Knight was investigated and threatened with suspension because any \nrecording could potentially prove malfeasance on the part of the parties she recorded. \n165.  Black women officers are also disciplined for infractions that they could not avoid, such as \nPlaintiff Brinkley, who was disciplined for not having her temperature taken when MPD posted \nno one to execute the COVID protocol task.   \n166.  Plaintiff Mitchell was disciplined for missing a call-out while she was on approved FMLA \nleave, and not meant to be disturbed because she was caring for a sick parent.   \n167.  Black women officers are disproportionately disciplined for alleged infractions that were \nbased on completely fictitious allegations.  See., e.g., factual narratives below of Plaintiffs Brown, \nKnight and Mitchell. \n168.  And when the claims are proved not only to be false but to have been made in bad faith, \nthe accuser is not disciplined.    \n169.  In sharp contrast to the rampant and free-flowing discipline of Black women officers, white  \nmale officers are highly favored and forgiven for very serious transgressions. \n29 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 30 of 219\n \n170.  For example, on one occasion, a white male sergeant took out his penis and urinated into a \nbottle while riding in a police vehicle with a female officer, instead of asking to pull over and \nurinate in a bathroom or in the woods. See., e.g., factual narratives below of Plaintiffs Brinkley \nand Mitchell. Rather than being disciplined for this serious violation, the officer was promoted to \nLieutenant shortly thereafter, and Plaintiff Mitchell  was retaliated against for making “a big deal” \nof it.  \n171.  MPD has maintained a pattern, practice, and custom of not only excusing misconduct from \nwhite male officers with respect to their conduct within the MPD, but also with respect to their \ninteractions with the community. \n172.  Upon information and belief, and to a statistically significant degree, white male officers \nare the subjects of more complaints of use of excessive force than any other group of officers at \nMPD. \n173.  However, they are not disciplined for their actions, even when the MPD is forced to \ncompensate the victims of their excessive force. \n174.  Several MPD officers were involved in a Facebook forum for the MPD that devolved into \na platform to attack and denigrate fellow officers.  Several male officers on the forum engaged in \nsystematic bullying of fellow officers based on race and gender. \n175.  IAD was ultimately asked to investigate the forum, and the forum was eventually shut \ndown.  Upon information and belief, not a single male officer involved in the cyber-bullying was \nheld to account for his actions.  \n176.  Upon information and belief, a second MPD officers Facebook forum currently exists, and \nMPD male officers continue to make racist and sexist comments.  \n30 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 31 of 219\n \n177.  Upon information and belief, the MPD maintains a pattern, practice and custom of not \ntaking appropriate disciplinary action against officers who openly express racist and sexist views.  \nNor does it track or monitor whether those views affect the involved officers’ performance of their \npolicing duties as per the community at large or their fellow officers.  \n178.  MPD’s  maintenance  of  disparate  and  discriminatory  disciplinary  standards  has  a \nstatistically significant disparate impact on Black women officers as compared to their peers, and \nalso subjects them to rampant disparate treatment. \n179.  MPD’s maintenance of disparate and discriminatory disciplinary standards also contributes \nsignificantly to the maintenance of a hostile and toxic work environment for Black women officers. \n  MPD HAS A PATTERN, PRACTICE AND CUSTOM OF CONDONING SEXUAL \nHARASSEMENT, SEX-BASED DISCRIMINATION AND MISCONDUCT, AND \nREWARDING  AND  PROTECTING  MALE  OFFICERS  WHO  ENGAGE  IN \nSEXUALLY INAPPROPRIATE CONDUCT OR SPEECH \n \n180.  As can be seen in the individual narratives of the CRP’s, MPD has a long history of \nprotecting men who sexually harass Black women police officers.  See., e.g., factual narratives \nbelow of Plaintiffs Dickerson, Hampton, Knight, and Grier. \n181.  It also has a pattern, practice and custom of being dismissive of sexually charged language \nor “locker-room talk” in police meetings and gatherings in which women officers are present, thus \ncondoning and encouraging officers to use inappropriate and patently sexist language in the \nworkplace.   \n182.  When  Black  women  police  officers  have  complained  about  sexual  harassment,  or \ninappropriate sexist language, they have been targeted for retaliation by their supervisors; when \nthey seek intervention by the upper chain of command, their complaints are dismissed or ignored.   \n183.  MPD’s Chiefs of Police have the authority and the capacity to instill a zero-tolerance policy \nthroughout MPD for the use of sexist language, locker room talk, and abusive and denigrating \n31 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 32 of 219\n \ncomments.  To date, the MPD Chiefs of Police who have presided during the relevant period, have \nnot set or enforced such a policy. \n184.  On the contrary, they have instilled and perpetuated a culture permissive of denigration \nand disrespect, one that welcomes and promotes bullying, retaliation, isolation, targeting and \nharassment of Black women officers who oppose such sexist and discriminatory speech and \nactions. \n185.  MPD’s tolerance of sexual harassment in the workplace has a disparate impact on Black \nwomen officers as compared to their peers, and also subjects them to rampant disparate treatment.  \nIt further contributes significantly to the maintenance of a hostile work environment for Black \nwomen officers. \n186.  All of the CRPs have identified this abusive, sexist culture as a central component of the \nhostile work environment created for Black women police officers.   \n187.  All PCMs are subjected to the same culture and social dynamics within the MPD. \n188.  All PCMs would obtain a remedy if the Court were to grant declaratory and injunctive \nrelief to the class, and mandate that the MPD Chiefs of Police issue new policy with respect to \nappropriate tone and culture for professionals at the MPD. \n189.  All class members would obtain a remedy if the Court were to grant declaratory and \ninjunctive relief to the class with respect to mandating that the MPD cease and desist retaliating \nagainst Black women officers who complain of, or oppose the use of sexist and derogatory \nlanguage by MPD officers. \n190.  All class members would obtain a remedy if the Court were to grant declaratory and \ninjunctive relief to the class with respect to mandating that the MPD revamp its EEO Office, and \nupdate its EEO counseling and investigative policies and practices. \n32 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 33 of 219\n \nMPD  HAS  A  PATTERN,  PRACTICE  AND  CUSTOM  OF  WITHHOLDING \nRESOURCES  FROM  BLACK  WOMEN  POLICE  OFFICERS  AND \nUNDERMINING THEIR AUTHORITY AND ABILITY TO EXECUTE THEIR \nDUTIES \n \n191.  As part of  its culture,  pattern, practice and custom of treating Black women police officers \nas second-class citizens, the MPD routinely provides Black women police officers poor, or \ninappropriate equipment.  See., e.g., factual narratives below of Plaintiffs Brinkley, Mitchell, and \nClark. \n192.  In one case it assigned a pair of Black women police officers a flea-infested vehicle and \nrefused to permit them to use a cleaner or better car.   \n193.  In another instance MPD refused to provide a Black female officer with the appropriate \nvehicle to execute her duties on a presidential detail.   \n194.  Black women police officers promoted into management roles are given less resources than \ntheir colleagues and are placed in control over smaller and/or less desirable districts, divisions and \ndepartments. See., e.g., factual narratives of Plaintiffs Dickerson & Lockerman. \n195.  MPD  management  often  undermines  the  authority  of  Black  women  officers  in  the \nmanagement structure by allowing or encouraging insubordination, usurping discretion form \nBlack women officers, and sabotaging their management decisions.  See., e.g., factual narratives \nbelow of Plaintiffs Lockerman, Hampton, and Dickerson. \n196.  MPD maintains a work culture that is hostile to women, and tolerates and rewards behavior \nthat is demeaning, denigrating, disrespectful, unprofessional and harmful, and in this manner, it \nmaintains a workplace that is hostile and toxic to women. \n197.  When Black women officers complain about disparate treatment in the provision of \ndepartment resources, they are at best, ignored, and more often, retaliated against. \n33 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 34 of 219\n \n198.  The claims of the class representative plaintiffs with respect to being denied appropriate \ngear, vehicles, staff and other resources, to execute their duties safely and adequately, are typical \nof the claims of the PCMs, such that resolution on a class basis will remedy all claims.   \n \nRULE 23 FACTORS \nRULE 23(a) FACTORS \n   NUMEROSITY \n199.  At the time of this filing, the exact number of the members of the class is not known.  \nPlaintiffs will seek appropriate pre-certification discovery to ascertain the exact number.  On \ninformation and belief, based on the current number of Black women officers employed by the \nMPD, and the estimated rate of turn-over, the putative class would be in excess of minimally \nseven hundred (700) putative class members. \n200.  That number well exceeds the standard for meeting the numerosity standard, and the \ninterest of judicial efficiency will clearly be served by class treatment of the claims herein. \n201.  Joinder of the cases is impractical, inefficient, and likely to deny justice to the class, \ninasmuch as the substantial potential for retaliation against litigants from the MPD would dissuade \nputative plaintiffs from filing individual actions. \nCOMMONALITY \n202.  Plaintiffs reassert all the factual allegations in the paragraphs above as if fully restated \nherein. \n203.  The questions of fact common to the class are outlined in the factual section above.  \n204.  The questions of law common to the class include, but are not limited to, the following: \n34 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 35 of 219\n \na.  Whether MPD’s practice of systematic retaliation against Black women police \nofficers who complain about race or sex discrimination, or misconduct violates the law and \nPlaintiffs’ civil rights? \nb.  Whether MPD maintenance of an EEO office predisposed to dismiss and invalidate \nany and all claims of discrimination or workplace harassment violates federal and DC law? \nc.  Whether MPD permitting an EEO Director to make false statements in EEO \ninvestigations, and to violate confidentiality to chill and discourage the use of the EEO \nprocess violates federal and DC law? \nd.  Whether MPD’s used of an overbroad NDA to prevent EEO Department employees \nfrom reporting unlawful EEO violates federal and DC law. \ne.  Whether  MPD’s  practice  of  promoting  male  officers  into  “Acting  Official” \npositions in order to deny or delay promotions for Black women officers violates federal \nand DC law?  \nf.  Whether MPD’s use of the IAD’s investigative process to retaliate against Black \nwomen officers who complain about race or gender discrimination, or police misconduct \nviolates federal and DC law? \ng.  Whether  MPD’s  systematic  withholding  of  desirable  assignments,  and  career \ngrowth opportunities from Black women officers is a violation of federal and DC law?  \nh.  Whether MPD’s custom and culture of permitting male officers to use sexist and \nsexually charged language in the workplace, creates a hostile work environment for women \nofficers, according to the law? \ni.  Whether Defendant breached a duty to Plaintiffs by failing to monitor and manage \nthe MPD EEO Department, thus allowing it to violate Plaintiffs’ civil rights?  \n35 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 36 of 219\n \nj.  Whether Defendant’s pattern, practice and/or custom of involuntarily transferring \nBlack women officers who report race or gender discrimination, or police misconduct \nviolates the DC Whistleblower law?  \nk.  Whether MPD’s systematic bullying and retaliation against Black women officers \nwho testify before the DC City Council, or who informed the Mayor’s office of race or \ngender discrimination, or police misconduct, violates DC law?   \nTYPICALITY \n205.  As can be seen in the individual narratives and claims infra, while all Plaintiffs do not have \nthe exact same story, they do all have the same experience with MPD management and the MPD \nEEO Department. \n206.  The CRPs who complained to EEO were subject to the same treatment and their respective \nclaims were similarly ignored, minimized, and dismissed. Their claims are typical of all Black \nwomen officers who attempted to report workplace complaints to MPD’s EEO Department in \norder to resolve their discrimination claims.  \n207.  The CRPs who complained to their managers and supervisors about disparate and unfair \ntreatment were treated in precisely the same way.  Their claims are typical of all Black women \nofficers who sought help from their management leaders, and were rebuffed or ignored. \n208.  The CRPs who became the subject of a campaign to be pushed out of the MPD, were all \nthe victims of the whims of the Chief of Police, and were treated in the exact same way.  Their \nclaims are typical of the many Black women officers who have been similarly targeted by the \nChiefs of Police and harassed and pressured into resigning or prematurely retiring.  \n36 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 37 of 219\n \n209.  The CRPs who were subjected to a work environment rife with sexist and sexually charged \nlanguage were all dismissed when they complained about it. Their claims are typical of all the \nBlack women who were forced to endure a sexually charged and sexist work environment. \n210.  The  CRPs  who  were  investigated  or  threatened  with  investigation  in  retaliation  for \ncomplaining about race and gender discrimination, or police misconduct, have claims that are \ntypical of all Black women officers who were so targeted. \nADEQUACY OF REPRESENTATION \n211.  The cadre of CRPs are made up of Black women that represent or have experience in all \ncomponents of MPD.  Two are management employees.  Four are Senior Police Officers.  Three \nare currently employed sworn officers.  Three are recently retired.  One was terminated in \nretaliation  for  opposing  discrimination.    One  worked  in  the  Academy  for  long  enough  to \nadequately represent academy-level trainees. \n212.  The CRPs are from a variety of departments, and all have substantial experience on the \nforce.  Combined, they have over 230+ years of professional police experience. \n213.  One CRP is a member of the Senior Executive Leadership Team of the MPD, and has a \nunique perspective on how senior management, and especially Chiefs of Police, wield their power.  \n214.  Class Counsel, Temple Law Offices, has been in operation in the District of Columbia \nsince 1991 and known to represent victims of workplace wrongs and commercial discrimination. \nDonald M. Temple has practiced law for more than 42 years, 31 years in private practice.  He has \nsuccessfully litigated multiple civil rights and workplace-based race discrimination to successful \njury verdicts in the D.C. and Maryland federal courts which include  Squires v. District of \nColumbia,  Eric  Payne  vs.  the  District  of  Columbia  et  al.,  Case  No.  10-cv-00679-PLF \n(USDC)(after  eight  years  of  litigation);  Proctor  et  al.  v.  Washington  Suburban  Sanitation \n37 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 38 of 219\n \nCommission; Laura Jackson v. District of Columbia Department of Health, et, al., Case No. 2013 \nCA 003442 P(MPA) (DCSC) (after nine years of litigation).   \n215.  Attorney Temple has also obtained successful appellate reversals in both the D.C. state and \nfederal courts, the Fourth Circuit, and the United States Supreme Court including, but not limited \nto,  the  following  decisions:    Linwood  Q.  Ham  et  al.  v.  Washington  Suburban  Sanitation \nCommission, Appeal No, 04-2021  (CA4thCircuit), Stephanie Brown v. Allen Sessoms, President \nUniversity of District of Columbia, Case No. 13-Y7027 (US Court of Appeals,   DC Circuit), \nNanko Shipping, USA, Parent Company of Nanko Shipping Guinea, et al., v. ALCOA, INC., Alcoa \nWorld Alumina, CASE No. 15-7070 (US Court of Appeals for DC), Capital Services Management, \nInc. v. Vesta Corporation (US Court of Appeals D.C. Circuit), and Stephanie Artis v. District of \nColumbia (Co-Counsel), United States Supreme Court.       \n216.  Class Counsel, Pamela Keith, has been a labor and employment attorney for twenty-one \n(21)  years.    She  worked  at  some  of  the  most  prestigious  labor  and  employment  firms  in \nWashington, DC: Jones Day, Morgan Lewis & Bockius and Ogletree Deakins, prior to joining \nTemple Law Offices.  Attorney Keith worked extensively on one of the largest class actions in \nAmerican history (Dukes, et al. v. Walmart) while employed with Jones Day, and spent years \nworking extensively on Rule 23 litigation.  \n217.  Temple Law Offices have the experience, reputation, and stability to adequately represent \nthe interests of the litigants and the putative class. \n \nRULE 23(b)(2) FACTORS \n218.  Plaintiffs reassert all the factual allegations in the paragraphs above as if fully restated \nherein. \n38 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 39 of 219\n \n219.  While the CRPs do have individual claims for which they seek redress, certification of the \nputative class under Rule 23(b) is appropriate because declaratory and injunctive relief will provide \na remedy to all PCMs with respect to MPD policies and practices that violate the law.  \n220.  The fact that MDP is a top-down chain of command structure ensures that unlawful or \ndiscriminatory policies and practices that emanate from the Chiefs of Police are carried out by \ntheir subordinates through the entire enterprise. \n221.  Conversely, discriminatory acts or practices engaged in by individual officers, through acts \nof individual discretion, can be mitigated or reversed by the Chief of Police.  Thus, the failure to \nintercede and stop reported and documented individual acts of discrimination and retaliation, is a \nfailure that can be remedied by declaratory, injunctive and affirmative means.  \n222.  Thus, declaratory, injunctive and affirmative relief to the entire class flows directly and \nautomatically from proof of the facts herein, and the establishment that such facts constitute \nviolations of the law. \n223.  The  entitlement  to  declaratory,  injunctive  and  affirmative  relief  to  the  entire  class \nnecessarily predominates the litigation, and provides a one-time remedy to all officers negatively \naffected by the unlawful policies and practices described herein. \n224.  Furthermore, the entitlement to declaratory, injunctive and affirmative relief forms the \nfactual and legal predicate for appropriate monetary damages as well as non-monetary remedies \nfor individual losses caused by the systemic and enterprise-wide unlawful conduct at MPD.  \n225.  Thus, certification of the class to test and answer the questions of law and fact common to \nthe class is appropriate, inasmuch as final legal resolution of those question will provide remedy \nand closure for both the putative class and the MPD. \nRULE 23(b)(3) FACTORS \n39 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 40 of 219\n \n226.  What is clear from the factual allegations herein is that nearly all that has transpired to the \nCRPs,  and  thus  to  the  putative  class,  is  the  result  of  deeply  embedded  race  and  gender \ndiscrimination, exacerbated by a profound culture of silencing, bullying and intimidating those \nwho complain about their respective and similar victimization. \n227.  There is no real or meaningful way for the putative class to otherwise obtain relief but \nthrough the class action process. \n228.  The MPD has been sued numerous times during the relevant period for race and gender \ndiscrimination and retaliation; none of those cases have produced any meaningful cultural or \nsystemic change with respect to its treatment of Black women police officers. \n229.  If, in this litigation, Plaintiffs are able to prove the allegations herein, then the declaratory, \ninjunctive and affirmative relief that flows therefrom will not simply remedy the injustice to them, \nit will modify policy, procedures, practices, customs, and modes of accountability.  This will  \nensure that future Black women police officers won’t have to endure the same hostile, sexist, racist \nand retaliatory environment that presently exists.  \n230.  This is precisely what the class action vehicle was designed to achieve, and why it is \nsuperior to any other available means for the adjudication of the claims of the CRPs or the class \nmembers. \n231.  Discovery related to the key decision-makers at MPD, and their policies and practices, is \nbest done once, on a class wide basis, rather than dozens or hundreds of times, for each litigant.  \nSuch would be incredibly expensive, as well as time consuming and distracting for the key \ndecision-makers.  \n232.  Allowing this matter to proceed as a class action will achieve economies of scale and cost, \nminimize the use of court recourses and time, ensure a consistent result applicable to all members \n40 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 41 of 219\n \nof the class, and ensure that declaratory and injunctive relief provides a resolution that can move \nforward and prevent future claims.  \n233.  Plaintiffs intend to communicate with the PCMs via electronic and regular mailings to last \nknown street address and email address, and any other method ordered by the court. Defendant is \nin possession of all information necessary to inform the PCMs of this action, and to inform them \nof their options as determined by this Court.  \nRULE 23(b)(5) FACTORS \n234.  Plaintiffs represent bargaining unit and non-bargaining unit members, sworn officers and \nSenior Police Officers, and management and executive officers.   \n235.  As deemed appropriate by this Court after conducting pre-certification discovery, Plaintiffs \nwill seek the establishment of sub-classes to dispose of individual claims more efficiently. \n     CLASS CAUSES OF ACTION \n236.  On behalf of themselves and the putative class (and/or appropriate sub-classes) of all \nsimilarly situated Black women police officers who are currently employed by the MPD, or who \nhave  been  employed  by  the  MPD  between  January  1,  2011,  and  the  present,  the  class-\nrepresentative Plaintiffs assert the following CLAIMS. \nRACE DISCRIMATION CLAIMS \nCOUNT I \nViolation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e, et seq., \nCOUNT II \nViolation of the District of Columbia Human Rights Act \nDistrict of Columbia Code § 2-1401.01 et seq. \nCOUNT III \nViolation of the Civil Rights Act of 1866 \nDiscrimination Based on Race in the Making and Enforcing of Contracts \n42 U.S.C. §1981(a) by way of, through and via 42 U.S.C. § 1983 \n41 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 42 of 219\n \n237.  MPD discriminated against Plaintiffs and the putative class of Black women police officers \non the basis of race, by way of maintaining a system-wide pattern and practice of disparate \ntreatment against Black women officers on the basis of race, creating and maintain a work \nenvironment hostile to Black women officers on the basis of race, fostering an EEO Office \ninherently and irredeemably hostile to Black women officers on the basis of race, denying \npromotion and career development opportunities to Black women officers, subjecting them to \ndisparate  disciplinary  standards,  undermining  the  rank  and  authority  of  Black  women, \nsystematically  disparaging  the  character  and  credibility  of  Black  women  officers,  and \nsystematically refusing to investigate or take seriously claims of discrimination lodged by Black \nwomen officers due to their race. \n238.  MPD perpetuates and maintains a pattern and practice of systematic retaliation against \nBlack women police officers who oppose, complain about or report race discrimination. \n239.  MPD’s  maintenance  of  unlawful  and  discriminator  practices  and  procedures  has  a \nstatistically significant disparate impact on Black women officers as compared to their peers, and \nalso subjects them to rampant disparate treatment. \nSEX DISCRIMINATION CLAIMS \nCOUNT IV \nViolation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e, et seq., \nCOUNT V \nViolation of the District of Columbia Human Rights Act \nDistrict of Columbia Code § 2-1401.01 et seq. \n \n240.  The MPD discriminated against Plaintiffs and the putative class of Black women police \nofficers on the basis of sex, in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, \n42 U.S.C. § 2000e, et seq., by way of maintaining a system-wide pattern and practice of disparate \n42 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 43 of 219\n \ntreatment against Black women officers on the basis of sex, creating and maintain a work \nenvironment hostile to Black women officers on the basis of sex, fostering an EEO Office \ninherently and irredeemably hostile to Black women officers on the basis of sex, and systematically \nrefusing to investigate or take seriously claims of discrimination lodged by Black women officers \ndue to their sex. \n241.  MPD perpetuates and maintains a pattern and practice of systematic retaliation against \nBlack women police officers who oppose, complain about or report sex discrimination or sexual \nharassment. \n242.  MPD’s  maintenance  of  unlawful  and  discriminatory  practices  and  procedures  has  a \nstatistically significant disparate impact on women officers as compared to their peers, and also \nsubjects them to rampant disparate treatment. \nADDITIONAL CLAIMS \nCOUNT VI \n \nViolation of the District of Columbia Whistleblower Protection Act \nD.C. Code § 1-615-51 et seq. \n \n243.  Pursuant  to  the  D.C.  Whistleblower  Protection  Act,  Defendant  is  prohibited  from \nreassigning, terminating or otherwise retaliating against a D.C. government employee as a result \nof that employee’s protected disclosures that the employee reasonably believes show gross \nmismanagement, gross misuse or waste of government resources, and abuse of authority in the \nconnection with the administration of a government program, or a violation of a state, local or \nfederal law, rule or regulation. \n244.  Defendant violated this Act by, in a coordinated and systematic way, retaliating against \nBlack  women  officers  whose  protective  disclosures  included  among  others,  the  following:    \n43 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 44 of 219\n \nallegations of discrimination to their superiors in MPD, in testimony before the City Council, and \ndirect communications to the Office of the Mayor about rampant racism, sexism, retaliation as \nwell as police misconduct.  \n245.  Defendant engaged in a pattern, practice, and custom of retaliation against those who \ncomplained to Superiors inside and outside side the confined of the MPD, and improperly used the \nIAD investigatory process to threaten and intimidate Black women officers into remaining silent, \nand investigating those who chose to come forward. \n246.   \nCOUNT VII \nFailure to Train, Supervise and Discipline Officers  \nResponsible for Continuous Violations  \nof  Departmental Policies, General Orders, and  Plaintiffs’ Civil and Constitutional Rights \n \n247.  Plaintiffs incorporate and restate all information and allegations contained in the preceding \nparagraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n248.  MPD management maintains an enterprise-wide culture, pattern and practice of subjecting \nBlack women officers to false accusations, unfair and disparate treatment and discipline, unfair \nand  unjustified  changes  to  job  assignments  and  duties,  retaliatory  investigations  and  other \nviolations of their civil and constitutional rights. \n249.  Defendant fosters a culture and environment where such violations were not only allowed \nto occur, but were encouraged and fully tolerated. \n250.  On multiple occasions, Plaintiffs complained of this systemic violation of their civil and \nconstitutional rights, going up their chain of command, all the way to the Chief of Police, the \nMayor and City Council. \n44 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 45 of 219\n \n251.  None  of  the  entities  to  which  Plaintiffs  complained  took  any  action  to  address  the \ncontinuous violation of their civil and constitutional rights.  \n252.  Plaintiffs assert that the District of Columbia owed them a duty of proper supervision of its \nMPD leadership, and that it has a responsibility to investigate and properly respond to their claims \nand concerns, which it, on multiple occasions, failed to do.  MPD Departments policies and \nprocedures, including its General Orders, as well as DC Municipal Regulations, require certain \nspecific supervisory protocols for honesty, accuracy, and completeness, among other things. \n253.  On multiple occasions, when it became clear that a member of the MPD made false or \nsalacious accusations against Plaintiffs, Defendant failed to properly discipline those persons, \nallowing them to remain in positions of power, and to continue to engage in violations of Plaintiffs’ \ncivil and constitutional rights. \n254.  On multiple occasions, when it became clear that a member of the MPD had engaged in \nunlawful retaliation against Plaintiffs for engaging in constitutionally protected activity, Defendant \nfailed to intercede, take appropriate remedial action, or admonish or discipline such persons. \n255.  Plaintiffs assert that Defendant owed them a duty and had a responsibility to properly \nsupervise MPD leadership and officers consistent with its policies and procedures, general orders, \nand DC Municipal Regulations, and that it failed to do so when it failed to hold persons accountable \nfor retaliating against Plaintiffs for engaging in constitutionally protected activity.  \n256.  The duty that Defendant owed to Plaintiffs to properly supervise and hold accountable the \nmanagement of the MPD extends equally to all members of the putative class of Black women \npolice officers.  \n257.  As a direct and proximate cause of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiffs suffered significant \neconomic harm in the form of loss of employment, corresponding salary, loss of employment \n45 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 46 of 219\n \nopportunities, and damage to their professional reputation, and significant mental and emotional \ndistress.  \n258.  The losses, damages and injuries suffered by Plaintiffs are a direct and proximate result of \nDefendant’s negligent supervision of the Chief of Police, the MPD EEO Office, and other MPD \nsenior leaders are common and typical of the harms suffered by the PCMs in this matter. \n259.  All PCMs would obtain a remedy if this Court were to grant declaratory, injunctive, and \ncompensatory relief to the class as a remedy for harms caused by Defendants’ breach of the duty \nowed to the class to properly supervise MPD management. \n260.  MPD’s failure to properly train, educate, supervise, manage and control its personnel has \na statistically significant disparate impact on Black women officers as compared to their peers, and \nalso subjects them to rampant disparate treatment. \n \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF ON BEHALF OF THE CLASS \nWHEREFORE, PLAINTIFFS, upon certification of the class/classes in accordance with the \nrequest herein, seek the following compensatory, declarative, and injunctive relief: \nCOMPENSATORY RELIEF \n261.

An ORDER granting Class Counsel attorney’s fees as agreed to by and between the CRPs \nand Class Counsel.  \n264.

An ORDER mandating a full and complete audit by the Special Master of the MPD’s \ndisciplinary  practices,  and  the  drafting  by  the  Special  Master  of  a  report  to  the  Court  on \nrecommended changes to ensure fair, equitable and non-discriminatory discipline of employees. \n270.  An ORDER mandating a full and complete audit by the Special Master of the MPD’s \nInternal Affairs Department, and the drafting by the Special Master of a report to the Court on \nrecommended changes to IAD to ensure the investigative function is no longer weaponized to \nretaliate  against  Black  women  officers  who  complain  about  or  oppose  race  or  gender \ndiscrimination, or police misconduct. \n271.  An ORDER mandating that the Special Master conduct a full and complete audit of the \nMPD’s promotion and assignment practices, and that the Special Master makes recommendations \nto the Court on changes to such policies and procedures to ensure that Black women are no longer \ndenied promotions or career opportunities. \n47 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 48 of 219\n \n272.

Any and all additional declaratory and injunctive relief as deemed appropriate by this \nCourt. \n                                        FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS AND CLAIMS \nOF THE INDIVIDUAL PLAINTIFFS \n \n                PLAINTIFF BRINKLEY’S INDIVIDUAL CLAIMS \n       Facts Related to Plaintiff Brinkley’s Individual Claims \n279.  Plaintiff Brinkley began her employment with MPD in October 1988.  She initially was \nassigned to the Morals Division and later to Patrol District One.   \n280.  In 1992, she was chosen for, and assigned to the Special Operations Division (hereinafter \n“SOD”) as an Emergency Response Team (hereinafter “ERT”) Station Clerk.   \n281.  That same year, Plaintiff Brinkley married fellow MPD officer, Matthew Brinkley.  They \nboth served on the MPD until 2014, when Mr. Brinkley retired.  Plaintiff Brinkley continued \nworking at the MPD well after he retired.  \n282.  The ERT unit of the MPD deals with hostage situations and other volatile and delicate \ncircumstances where a person might be barricaded in a building, refusing to cooperate with officer \ndemands, or holding hostages. \n283.  ERT is an elite unit, and considered a desirable and sought-after assignment.  Officers are \nscreened and chosen for their suitability to ERT and are trained in crisis management and tactics. \n284.  After about eighteen years in ERT as a negotiator, Plaintiff Brinkley was assigned to the \nDC Public Schools, and served there for approximately two years.  \n49 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 50 of 219\n \n285.  To round out her policing experience, Plaintiff Brinkley requested and was reassigned to a \nPatrol District.   \n286.  From approximately 2012 to November of 2016, Plaintiff Brinkley served continuously in \nthe First District Patrol unit without any complaint from her management about her performance.   \n287.  In November of 2016 Plaintiff Brinkley chose to retire from the MPD.  \n288.  In March of 2017, Plaintiff Brinkley was asked to return to active policing because MPD \nneeded to increase its officer headcount, most especially with respect to seasoned officers with \nspecialized training and skills. \n289.  At  the  time,  MPD  was  bringing  back  strong  and  experienced  officers  as  full-time \nemployees, but employed them by way of individual contracts, not as members of the FOP \nbargaining unit. \n290.  MPD offered Plaintiff Brinkley a contract to return as a Senior Police Officer (hereinafter \n“SPO”) within SOD to assist in the selection process and training of new reserve negotiators.  \n291.  Plaintiff Brinkley’s contract was for a year, renewable annually if she remained able to \nmeet physical and other requirements.  \n292.  Plaintiff Brinkley began her second stint as a DC Police Officer on April 3, 2017, assigned \nto ERT as a negotiator.   \n293.  At  the  time,  her  immediate  supervisor,  and  the  person  responsible  for  her  actual \nassignments was Sergeant Kevin O’Bryant (hereinafter “Sgt. O’Bryant”). \n294.  However, because ERT was a specialized unit, it had its own administrative chain of \ncommand, responsible for coordination, logistics and allocation of resources such as vehicles and \nprotective equipment.  \n50 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 51 of 219\n \n295.  At that time, the administrative Sergeant for ERT was Sergeant Michael Boyd (hereinafter \n“Sgt. Boyd.” \n296.  Plaintiff Brinkley’s partner at the time was officer Kia Mitchell who is a co-Plaintiff in this \ncase, (hereinafter “Plaintiff Mitchell”).   \n297.  Plaintiff  Brinkley  had  served  and  partnered  with  Plaintiff  Mitchell  during  her  first \nemployment with MPD for approximately twenty years.  They were close confidants, and often \nshared private matters with each other.  \n298.  Sgt. Boyd treated Plaintiff Brinkley and SPO Mitchell more harshly and negatively than \nany other officers in the unit, and more harshly than other non-Black female officers, and used his \nauthority and position to make things difficult and unpleasant for them.  \n299.  On or about May 2017 he assigned Plaintiff Brinkley and SPO Mitchell vehicles that had \nbeen used by the K-9 unit and had been infested with fleas.   \n300.  Plaintiff Brinkley and SPO Mitchell used the vehicle for a few days, but then notice’s the \nflea bites and resultant rashes, and asked Sgt. Boyd for different vehicles.   \n301.  Plaintiff Brinkley asserts, and on information and belief, there were other vehicles available \nat the time located on the top parking lot of SOD.   \n302.  Despite multiple requests, and having other options, Sgt. Boyd obstinately refused to assign \nPlaintiff Brinkley and her partner different vehicles.   \n303.  Sgt. Boyd’s recalcitrance with respect to Plaintiff’s request was disparate and unlike his \nresponse to requests from non-Black female officers and male officers. \n304.  On or about June 2017, Plaintiff Brinkley and SPO Mitchell went to the SOD Lieutenant, \nKenny Taylor (Black male) (hereinafter “Lt. Taylor”), Sgt. Boyd’s superior, and complained about \nthe fact that Sgt. Boyd refused to assign them a clean and un-infested vehicle.   \n51 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 52 of 219\n \n305.  To remedy their concerns, Lt. Taylor allowed them to use the ERT Suburban, a large and \ncomfortable vehicle.  \n306.  Plaintiff Brinkley and SPO Mitchell were driving in the Suburban when they received an \nirate phone call from Sgt. Boyd, demanding that they return the Suburban, despite the fact that his \nsuperior had authorized Plaintiff Brinkley and her partner to use the Suburban.  \n307.  From that point on, and for months thereafter, Sgt. Boyd undertook a campaign to retaliate \nagainst, undermine, isolate, spread false claims against and harass Plaintiff Brinkley and SPO \nMitchell. Given his seniority and position of authority, Sgt. Boyd was able to effectively execute \nhis scheme to retaliate against Plaintiff Brinkley and SPO Mitchell because he saw them virtually \nevery day and was in regular contact with their fellow officers.  \n308.  On or about July 9, 2019, Plaintiff Brinkley tragically and suddenly lost her husband and \nlifetime partner to an aneurysm.  \n309.  The loss was devastating to her, and she exhausted all of her accumulated sick and annual \nleave while on bereavement leave from the MPD.  \n310.  During her bereavement leave, Plaintiff Brinkley suffered from anxiety and depression, \nand sought the care of a medical professional and spiritual guidance to help manage her mental \nhealth challenges. \n311.  Plaintiff Brinkley returned to work on or about September 23, 2019, but was still struggling \nwith depression, and sleeplessness. She did seek counseling from the MPD-provided counseling \nservice, as well as private counseling and medical care.  \n312.  On or about September 24, 2019, Plaintiff Brinkley entered the roll call room for a major \ndetail assignment.  At the time the room was full of officers in formal uniform.  This triggered \n52 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 53 of 219\n \nthoughts of her late-husband and her grief overwhelmed her in that moment.  Her sobbing and \nemotional pain caused her to hyperventilate, and struggle with breathing.   \n313.  An ambulance was called, and upon arriving, the paramedics took her vital signs.  By then, \nher breathing had improved, and SPO Mitchell offered to take Plaintiff Brinkley home.  \n314.  Plaintiff Brinkley returned to work a few days later.  When she did, SPO Mitchell and \nOfficer Tabatha Knight (Black female) (hereinafter “Officer Knight”), informed her superior, \nLieutenant Darnell Robinson (hereinafter “Lt. Robinson”) had made derogatory comments about \nher extreme grief, had publicly denigrated her for exhibiting symptoms of depression and anxiety, \nand had threatened to send Plaintiff Brinkley for a fitness for duty evaluation, which is a first step \nto termination for the job for unfitness.  In the culture of MPD, it is viewed as very punitive and a \nnegative mark on one’s record for promotional purposes.   \n315.  Plaintiff Brinkley was shocked to hear and learn that her superior held her in such low \nesteem that he would speak in a denigrating manner about her disability, and believed her \nperceived disability was disqualifying. \n316.  Plaintiff Brinkley further understood that Lt. Robinson had no concern for her, or her well-\nbeing, and that she needed to hide her symptoms or face retaliation, or discrimination based on her \ndisability.  Lt. Robinson’s comments made clear that he disfavored Plaintiff Brinkley as a result \nof her perceived disability, and created a hostile work environment for Plaintiff Brinkley because \nof his perception of her. \n317.  Plaintiff Brinkley’s experiences with Sgt. Boyd marked the first time in her 26-year MPD \ncareer that she was personally singled out for the systematic, orchestrated and intentional micro-\naggressive retaliation that has become a cancer in the MPD that targets Black women officers, and \nparticularly harms those who complain about the disparate and unfair treatment they endure. \n53 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 54 of 219\n \n318.  On or about December 14, 2018, Plaintiff’s supervisor, Sgt. O’Bryant, left ERT SOD and \nwas reassigned to the Mayor’s detail.  Sgt. O’Bryant was known as a devout Christian, and very \nprofessional officer.  He ensured that people in his department adhered to a high level of decorum \nand respect for each other.  Upon his departure, the culture of ERT changed dramatically. \n319.  Sgt. O’Bryant was replaced by Sgt. John Brown (Black male) sometime in June of 2019, \nwho had a totally different leadership style.  Sgt. Brown was far more permissive and tolerant of \nunprofessional and inappropriate comments, most especially by male officers towards female \nofficers. \n320.  Upon the change in leadership, it became a common occurrence for officers in SOD to use \nfoul language and make inappropriate sexual comments.  Plaintiff Brinkley had raised concerns \nabout the declining professionalism of the unit to Sgt. Brown, but he ignored her concerns.   \n321.  SOD roll call is an official meeting of officers on their shifts to discuss assignments and \nshare information from previous shifts or other units.  Roll call is also an opportunity for \ndepartment  leaders  to  check-in  with  their  officers  and  receive  feed-back  and  give  daily \ninstructions, updates and important information.  \n322.  Roll call is also an opportunity for officers to see and engage with their colleagues.  \nBecause officers disperse during their shifts, roll call can be the only place where officers get to \nknow each other.  \n323.  On or about February 4, 2020, Plaintiff was the only female officer in a roll call meeting \nconducted by Sgt. Thomas Miller (White male) (hereinafter Sgt. Miller) and Sgt. Brown.  \n324.  When Sgt. Brown told Officer Eric Harrison (White male) (hereinafter “Officer Harrison”) \nto work with another officer, Officer Harrison responded by shouting “he can suck my dick.” \n54 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 55 of 219\n \nPlaintiff Brinkley immediately looked up to the Sgts. in attendance, and heard several members \nlaughing.   \n325.  But neither Sgt. Miller nor Sgt. Brown addressed the foul and inappropriate comment. \n326.  This was one of the straws that broke the camel’s back for Plaintiff Brinkley.  She got up \nfrom the meeting and walked out, rather than confront again the unprofessionalism and obscenity \nof her co-worker.  \n327.  Plaintiff Brinkley spoke to Sgt. Brown after the meeting, who admitted that the comment \nwas inappropriate, but who refused to do anything to stop such comments and re-establish and \nenforce the professionalism standards of the department.  \n328.  Plaintiff Brinkley later texted Lt. Robinson to complain about the offensive language \nbecause she felt the complaint would not be handled by Sgts. Miller and Brown.  \n329.  Lt. Robinson replied “until further notice he will show his presence in roll call, etc.”  \nHowever, he did not follow through with his assurances to Plaintiff Brinkley, and did not attend \nroll call thereafter. \n330.  Having received no action from Lt. Robinson to rectify a work environment that had \ndevolved into “lock-room talk” central, and that constantly made her, the only female in the room, \nuncomfortable, Plaintiff Brinkley went to the MPD EEO office to complain.  \n331.  On or about February 5, 2020, Plaintiff Brinkley was advised by Lt. Robinson to make a \ncomplaint to MPD EEO Mr. Lee, in which she was contacted to by EEO officer Doreen Haines \n(Black woman) (hereinafter “Ms. Haines”) about Officer Harrison’s comment, and the fact that \nSgt. Brown had permitted the comment to go without any action or redress.  \n332.  She further complained that Sgt. Brown was permitting her workplace to become a hyper-\nsexualized and obscenity-laden workplace.  \n55 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 56 of 219\n \n333.  During her interview with MPD EEO office, Plaintiff Brinkley did not believe that EEO \ninvestigator Ms. Ranae Lee (hereinafter “Ms. Lee”) had offered advice and guidance to Plaintiff \nor taken her concerns seriously.   \n334.  All the EEO interviews were recorded. On information and belief, Ms. Lee played the \nrecording for Mr. Alphonso Lee, her supervisor in the EEO department.  Mr. Lee disciplined Ms. \nLee for being “too helpful” to Plaintiff Brinkley, and for giving any credence to Plaintiff Brinkley’s \ncomplaint.  \n335.  On information and belief, Mr. Lee leaked to Sgt. Boyd that Plaintiff Brinkley had \ncomplained about him and the toxic work-environment he was fostering. \n336.  From that point on, Plaintiff Brinkley became the target of a concerted, intentional and \nsystematic retaliatory campaign to drum her out of the MPD. \n337.  According to EEO Counselor Harry Carter (Black male) (hereinafter “Mr. Carter”), who \nworked directly for Mr. Lee and was privy to Mr. Lee’s comments about Plaintiff Brinkley, Mr. \nLee told Ms. Doreen Haines and Ms. Ranae Lee before an investigation had been conducted \nregarding Plaintiff Brinkley’s complaint, as well as complaints from several other Black female \nofficers, that “MPD would be better off if they figured out how to fire officers like [Plaintiff], \nOfficer Karen Carr (Black female), and Officer Tabatha Knight (Black female) because all they \ndid was file complaints.” \n338.  In short, EEO Director Lee decided that MPD would benefit from moving out Plaintiff and \nsome of the other Black female officers with similar complaints and initiated a campaign in MPD \nto achieve that goal.  \n339.  Plaintiff Brinkley became alarmed at the retaliation and discrimination that was taking \nplace at the MPD and wrote to Mayor Muriel Bowser to report what was going on.   \n56 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 57 of 219\n \n340.  Plaintiff Brinkley received a response from the Mayoral office on or about March 26, 2020. \n341.  On or about March 25, 2020, there was a scheduled meeting with Lt. Robinson, Sgt.  \nBrown, Plaintiff Brinkley’s partner SPO Mitchell and Plaintiff Brinkley.  \n342.  When Plaintiff Brinkley asked about the status of her complaint, Lt. Robinson became \nhostile, dismissing her concerns and simply stating that such investigations “take time.” \n343.  Even more troubling to Plaintiff Brinkley, towards the end of the meeting, Lt. Robinson \nindicated that he would be separating Plaintiff Brinkley and her long-time partner SPO Mitchell, \nbecause there were “red flags,” with regards to them and that “they were being watched” and seen \ntransferring bags from one car to another.   \n344.  Lt. Robinson further stated that Plaintiff Brinkley and SPO Mitchell needed to “watch the \ncompany they kept.”  \n345.  Plaintiff Brinkley interpreted these statements as both a warning and a threat, and as thinly \nveiled retaliation for her reporting her concerns of discrimination and retaliation to the Mayor’s \nOffice.   \n346.  Lt. Robinson was telegraphing to her that her concerns were unimportant, and also that in \nraising her concerns, she was becoming the subject of scrutiny and a target for retaliation. \n347.  Lt. Robinson decision to separate Plaintiff Brinkley from her long-time partner was, and \nwas meant to be, punitive.   \n348.  Both Plaintiff Brinkley and SPO Mitchell felt the move to separate them was punitive in \nnature, and very destabilizing and unsettling to their work life.  \n349.  Worse still, around the time of the meeting, Lt. Robinson chose to discipline Plaintiff \nBrinkley for arriving at work too early, something that in all her years in the MPD, Plaintiff had \nnever seen another officer disciplined for.  \n57 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 58 of 219\n \n350.  On or about April 9, 2020, Plaintiff Brinkley went on sick leave due to exposure to the \ncoronavirus because she had been around SPO Mitchell, who had tested positive for the virus.  \nPlaintiff went on leave per Center for Disease Control (hereinafter “CDC”) protocols.   \n351.  However, when she was tested, she came up negative, so she returned to work prior to \ncompleting the full 14-day quarantine period.  \n352.  On or about April 21, 2020, Plaintiff Brinkley elected to file an OHR complaint, alleging \ndiscrimination and retaliation and seeking redress for her concerns about the treatment of Black \nWomen Officers in the MPD. \n353.  According to CDC guidelines, the entrance and exit of the SOD building was limited to \none door, so that persons entering could have their temperatures taken, and answer health questions \nto assess their risk. \n354.  From June 5, 2020, to June 12, 2020, the officials of SOD ERT failed to post someone at \nthe door to conduct the health assessments.  So, when Plaintiff arrived at work, she looked around, \nand then entered the building.  Obviously, several other officers did the same thing.  \n355.  On or about June 9, 2020, Plaintiff Brinkley notified Sgt. Brown about the fact that there \nwas no one conducting health screening assessments at the SOD entrance, to which Sgt. Brown \nunhelpfully responded that he was “drawing a blank.”  \n356.  Plaintiff Brinkley raised the issue because she had already been exposed to COVID-19 at \nwork and lived through the anxiety of waiting for a test result, which exacerbated her anxiety \ncondition. She had no desire to repeat the experience.  \n357.  On June 16, 2020, Plaintiff Brinkley reasserted her concerns about the fact that the CDC-\nmandated health assessments were not being conducted because there was no one stationed at the \nentrance to do them.  She spoke with Sgt. Brown, who told her to speak to Lt. Robinson. \n58 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 59 of 219\n \n358.  The same day, Plaintiff Brinkley reached out to Lt. Robinson, who answered her concern \nwith a one-word response: “noted.” \n359.  Subsequently  Lt.  Robinson  sent  Plaintiff  Brinkley  an  email  about  her  duties  for  an \nupcoming detail, but made no mention of the mandatory health assessment, or her legitimate \nconcerns regarding the fact that they were not being conducted.  \n360.  On June 17, 2020, Sgt. Miller raised to SPO Mitchell that “someone complained” about \nthe health assessments not being done, thus letting SPO Mitchell know that the leadership was \nannoyed with Plaintiff Brinkley’s persistent complaints about the issue.   \n361.  When Plaintiff Brinkley arrived at work that day, a tactical officer on limited duty stationed \nat the door took her temperature but did not ask the health assessment questions.  \n362.  On June 19, 2020, when Plaintiff Brinkley reported for duty, again there was no one at the \nSOD entrance to conduct the assessment.  Plaintiff Brinkley entered the building and went to the \nnegotiator’s office, where Sgt. Brown, took her temperature.  \n363.  Again, Sgt. Brown, and the rest of the leadership team failed to take Plaintiff Brinkley’s \nconcerns seriously and made her feel like a pariah for raising the issue. This compounded her stress \nand anxiety about entering a workplace that was clearly not abiding by CDC-guidelines.     \n364.  On or about July 10, 2020, Plaintiff Brinkley was shocked to receive an email from Captain \nMichelle  Caron  (White  female)  (hereinafter  “Capt.  Caron”),  that  was  curt  and  aggressive, \ndemanding that Plaintiff provide an explanation as to why she had not submitted a written \nstatement regarding an incident she had witnessed between Sgt. Boyd and Officer Carr.  \n365.  In fact, Plaintiff Brinkley was not evading Captain Caron’s request, but was simply on \nleave during the time of her request.   \n59 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 60 of 219\n \n366.  Had Captain Caron inquired, the Captain would have discovered that Plaintiff Brinkley \nwas not being evasive.   \n367.  Again, this incident was part of a pattern in which Plaintiff Brinkley was treated with \nsuspicion and disregard.  \n368.  Three days after receiving Captain Caron’s accusatory email, Plaintiff Brinkley was called \nin to IAD to answer to a charge that she had missed a health assessment in roll call.   \n369.  This was precisely the issue that Plaintiff Brinkley not only raised to her leadership, but \nwas persistently ignored about.  When she pointed out that there was no one stationed at the \ndesignated entrance, IAD informed Plaintiff Brinkley that she should have “gone in and looked” \nfor an official.   \n370.  Plaintiff Brinkley responded that there was no one to find on that particular date.  \n371.  This episode of intimidation and retaliation was particularly stunning to Plaintiff Brinkley, \nbecause of her efforts to address the issue of health assessments at the entrances, which were \nignored by her chain of command.   \n372.  But rather than simply dismissing the claim, IAD kept the case open and refused to clear \nPlaintiff Brinkley of the allegation. \n373.  As mentioned above, MPD EEO and IAD were blithely leaking and sharing information \nfrom confidential interviews with rank-and-file officers, which spread like wildfire through the \ndepartment. This was a concerted effort by EEO Director Lee and others to sow distrust and anger \nin the department, and to isolate and intimidate Plaintiff Brinkley. \n374.  Thus, at the roll call that took place on or about July 17, 2020, Officer Anthony Campanale \n(White male) (hereinafter “Officer Campanale”) shouted at Plaintiff Brinkley asking if she was \n60 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 61 of 219\n \nrecording the roll call.  Plaintiff Brinkley took immediate offense at his volatile and physically \naggressive stance and tone, and asked Officer Campanale “who are you talking to?”   \n375.  Officer Campanale continued to aggressively question and move into Plaintiff Brinkley’s \npersonal space and had to be restrained by other officers in the room.   \n376.  Officer Campanale was so aggressive, that he made Plaintiff Brinkley fear for her personal \nsafety.   \n377.  Sgt. Luke Foskett (hereinafter “Sgt. Foskett”) was conducting the roll call.   \n378.  When Plaintiff Brinkley asked him if he was going to do anything about Officer Campanale \naggressively charging her, Sgt. Foskett asked Plaintiff Brinkley: “well are you recording?”  \n379.  The Sgt.’s response was so offensive, and so inappropriate, that Plaintiff Brinkley simply \nwalked out of the roll call, shaking with anger and anxiety. \n380.  Plaintiff Brinkley immediately notified her Union Steward Hiram Rosario (hereinafter \n“Union Steward Rosario”) and Officer Knight, who notified the chain of command.  \n381.  On or about July 22, 2020, Plaintiff Brinkley met with EEO Director Lee and complained \nabout the retaliation from members of the SOD unit.   \n382.  Mr. Lee informed Plaintiff Brinkley that she could file an EEOC charge, which was his \nway of communicating that his department would not be investigating her claims. \n383.  As part of his ongoing campaign of petty attacks, on or about August 14, 2020, Sgt. Boyd \nordered Plaintiff to put her cell phone away at roll call, even though he kept both of his cell phones \nvisible on the table in front of him, and he allowed other male tactical officers to keep their cell \nphones out and visible.   \n384.  Plaintiff Brinkley could not help but feel embarrassed and singled out as the only female \nofficer in the roll call, targeted for blatantly disparate application of the rules.  \n61 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 62 of 219\n \n385.  On or about August 16, 2020, Plaintiff Brinkley was off work when the ERT unit issued a \npolicy change requiring officers to wear their ballistic vests at roll call.   \n386.  Because Plaintiff Brinkley was off that day, she was not informed of the policy change, but \nall the other tactical officers were aware of the change. \n387.  On or about August 18, 2020, on Plaintiff Brinkley’s first shift after her day off, Sgt. Boyd \npublicly embarrassed and singled out Plaintiff in the roll call meeting for not wearing her protective \nvest, even though he knew she was off when the policy change occurred, and that he, as her \nsupervisor, failed to give her a heads’ up about the new rule.   \n388.  Sgt. Brown used this innocuous and unintentional oversight as a basis to further humiliate \nPlaintiff Brinkley, and belittle her in front of her colleagues.  \n389.  On or about August 27, 2020, Plaintiff Brinkley was summoned to IAD again, to receive a \ndisciplinary charge related to the incident with Officer Campanale.   \n390.  Although Officer Campanale physically charged and threatened Plaintiff Brinkley, and had \nto be physically restrained from harming her, the Department decided to punish Plaintiff Brinkley \nfor “raising her tone,” which they deemed inappropriate.  \n391.  Plaintiff Brinkley was charged with conduct unbecoming an officer, and no discipline, at \nthat time, was given to Officer Campanale. \n392.  On or about September 1, 2020, Plaintiff Brinkley was disciplined for missing a call out \non a barricade.  Not only was she the first officer in the history of ERT to be disciplined for that, \nbut to add insult to injury, the Department went back in time to add the call-out she missed on \nMother’s Day in May.   \n393.  In other words, the Department leadership manufactured something to discipline Plaintiff \nBrinkley for, and then went looking for a way to increase the severity of the punishment.  \n62 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 63 of 219\n \n394.  On September 8, 2020, Capt. Caron asked Plaintiff Brinkley to write yet another statement \nregarding the incident involving Sgt. Boyd’s disrespectful and rude behavior towards Officer Carr, \nwho is also an African American female officer.   \n395.  Capt. Caron asked specific questions in her request to Plaintiff Brinkley designed to entrap \nPlaintiff Brinkley into making contradictory statements.   \n396.  Plaintiff Brinkley, however, did not modify her original statement.  \n397.  On or about September 10, 2020, Plaintiff Brinkley entered the SOD building to begin her \nshift, but found no one stationed there to take temperatures and conduct health assessments. Again, \nthis was a management failure and oversight that was used as an excuse to discipline Plaintiff \nBrinkley a few months prior, despite the fact that she had no authority to ensure that MPD adhered \nto CDC guidelines. \n398.  The lack of consistent manning of the SOD entrance with someone to conduct health \nassessments  and  take  temperatures  is  evidence  that  the  Department  was  not  serious  about \nprotecting the health of its officers (which explains why Plaintiff Brinkley was twice exposed to \nCOVID-19  from  her  co-workers)  but  was  instead  only  serious  about  manufacturing  phony \nviolations for which to discipline Plaintiff.  \n399.  On October 29, 2020, Plaintiff was given an assignment by Sgt. Boyd.  All the other \npersonnel with a similar assignment were relieved, but Plaintiff was not.  Plaintiff Brinkley had to \ncall in to remind Sgt. Brown that she needed to be relieved.   \n400.  Again, Plaintiff Brinkley had to work longer than her colleagues, and had to ask for the \ncourtesy and concern that was automatically given to her male counterparts.  \n401.  On October 31, 2020, Plaintiff sent an email to Chief of Police Peter Newsham (White \nmale)  (hereinafter  “Chief  Newsham”)  and  Assistant  Chief  Jeffery  Carroll  (White  male) \n63 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 64 of 219\n \n(hereinafter “Asst. Chief Carroll”) and others in the chain of command to complain and inform of \nthe systemic and sustained disparate treatment and discriminatory actions against Black female \nofficers in the MPD. \n402.  On or about November 3, 2020, Sgt. Brown allowed tactical members to come in before \ntheir scheduled duty and gave them assignments without disciplining them.  This stands in sharp \ncontrast to the discipline Plaintiff Brinkley received for coming in early for one single shift, and is \nfurther evidence of disparate treatment.  \n403.  Sgt. Brown did not conduct a roll call that day, nor a health assessment, but he did give \nPlaintiff Brinkley an assignment for ballot box detail, which she executed.  Plaintiff was shocked \nto be later written up for not attending the roll call or health assessment, that Sgt. Brown failed to \nhold or provide.   \n404.  This disciplinary write up was yet another example of breathtakingly unfair discipline, \nbased on pretext and false evidence, was designed to demoralize and break down Plaintiff \nBrinkley’s will.  \n405.  On  or  about  November  10,  2020,  Plaintiff  Brinkley  received  her  job  performance \ndocumentation.  In it she found several supposed “violations” that were basically trumped-up, \nfabricated, unjust, disparate or exaggerated charges, that formulated a basis for the Department to \nterminate her employment. \n406.  On or about November 24, 2020, Plaintiff Brinkley was exposed a second time to COVID-\n19, this time from one of the tactical officers who had tested positive, and therefore went back into \nquarantine until her test results were returned.   \n64 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 65 of 219\n \n407.  That day, Plaintiff Brinkley received a telephone call from her union representative Officer \nRosario advising her that IAD was moving forward with the “conduct unbecoming” charge against \nher for the incident with Officer Campanale.   \n408.  When Plaintiff Brinkley returned to work, she was told to report to IAD to sign paperwork \nrelated to the discipline over the Officer Campanale incident. Plaintiff strongly disagreed with the \ndisciplinary finding but signed the document anyway, noting on the document that she was signing \nunder duress, in order to be left alone. \n409.  In the normal course of business, Plaintiff Brinkley would have received her performance \nevaluation, and any notice of deficiencies, in order for her to have an opportunity to improve on \nthose deficiencies.   \n410.  However, in her case, Plaintiff Brinkley had to ask Sgt. Brown for her performance \nevaluation, and she was never given a list of deficiencies, or time to fix them.  Instead, she was \ngiven a very low performance evaluation based almost entirely on minor disciplinary matters that \nwere either fabricated, disproportionate, disparate or unfair.  \n411.  Plaintiff  Brinkley,  therefore  asked  for  a  meeting  to  discuss  her  concerns  about  her \nperformance evaluation and to explore how she could engage with management about her concerns \nwith the way she was being treated. \n412.  During Plaintiff Brinkley’s shift on or about December 8, 2020, while Plaintiff was talking \non the phone with her union representative, Sgt. Brown approached Plaintiff Brinkley to direct her \nto go to the roll call room for the performance evaluation meeting she had asked for.   \n413.  Rather than allowing Plaintiff Brinkley to finish her call, Sgt. Brown rudely and loudly \ninterrupted her, and gave her the directive about the meeting in a condescending, hostile and \ndisrespectful manner.  \n65 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 66 of 219\n \n414.  Plaintiff Brinkley had asked her union representative to hold while she spoke with Sgt. \nBrown, but because Sgt. Brown was speaking so loudly and aggressively, Officer Knight, the \nrepresentative, was able to hear the entire exchange.   \n415.  Officer Knight took note and was dismayed at the disrespectful and hostile tone that Sgt. \nBrown used to convey a simple directive.  \n416.  Plaintiff  Brinkley  went  to  the  meeting  as  directed  but  asked  for,  and  received, \nrepresentation from her union representative Officer Knight at the meeting.  \n417.  Once Plaintiff Brinkley arrived at the performance evaluation meeting, she found Sgt. \nBrown and one other Sgt. from a different department, whom Plaintiff did not know or recognize.   \n418.  Officer Knight, in her role as union representative, insisted that the performance evaluation \nmeeting only be attended by SOD managers.  Thus, the non-SOD Sgt. who was initially there, left \nthe  meeting  and  was  replaced  Sgt.  Jane  Barrientos  (Hispanic  female)  (hereinafter  “Sgt. \nBarrientos”).  \n419.  At  the  meeting,  Officer  Knight  questioned  and  challenged  Sgt.  Brown  about  the \ndisciplinary  matters  in  the  evaluation,  but  Sgt.  Brown  refused  to  make  any  substantial  or \nmeaningful changes to the evaluation.  Plaintiff Brinkley then formally appealed the content of her \nperformance evaluation.  \n420.  On or about December 9, 2020, while on shift, Plaintiff Brinkley started experiencing \nanxiety and migraine headache symptoms related to the stress of what had happened in her \nperformance evaluation meeting.   \n421.  She notified Sgt. Miller of her worsening condition and asked to go to the Police and Fire \nclinic for assistance.  \n66 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 67 of 219\n \n422.  On or about December 23, 2020, Plaintiff Brinkley filed a formal charge with the EEOC, \nalleging race, age, gender and disability discrimination, and retaliation, and disparate treatment.  \n423.  After seeing the clinic’s psychologist and speaking with the clinic’s Physician Assistant \nTasha Williams, Plaintiff Brinkley was placed on sick leave to mitigate her anxiety symptoms, \nuntil December 31, 2020.  \n424.  While on sick leave, Plaintiff was notified on or about December 12, 2020, that Sgt. Brown \nhad tested positive for COVID-19, and that she would have to be tested again for having been \nexposed for the third time, to a co-worker who had tested positive.     \n425.  Plaintiff reported to the Police and Fire Clinic for testing, and luckily tested negative.  \nHowever, the inconvenience and anxiety related to this third potential exposure, in conjunction \nwith the fact that her concerns and inquiries about non-compliance with coronavirus protocols by \nSOD management went unaddressed, caused Plaintiff to experience even more frustration with her \nsituation.  \n426.  Despite her union representative’s efforts to address the inaccurate and unfair disciplinary \nactions  in  Plaintiff  Brinkley’s  evaluation,  SOD  management  was  unwilling  to  modify  the \nassessment. Therefore, on or about January 9, 2021, Plaintiff wrote to MPD Assistant Chief Carroll \nand  several  city  council  members  regarding  the  disparate  treatment,  racial  inequality,  age \ndiscrimination, retaliatory behavior, harassment and criminal actions of the IAD.   \n427.  Plaintiff Brinkley was told and overheard on several occasions that SOD was moving out \nSPO’s because they were blocking promotional opportunities for younger officers, and that some \nmembers of management were not happy that there were so many older officers in the elite units. \n428.  The Assistant Chief replied on January 11, 2021, denying that any discriminatory practices \nexisted in SOD, and referred Plaintiff Brinkley back to EEO for investigations of her concerns.  \n67 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 68 of 219\n \nHis response was a slap in the face to Plaintiff Brinkley, inasmuch as she had complained of the \nfact that EEO was systematically ignoring and dismissing claims from Black female officers.  \n429.  On or about January 11, 2021, Plaintiff Brinkley received denial of her performance \nevaluation appeal from Master Patrol Officer Kevin Brittingham (White male) (hereinafter “MPO \nBrittingham”). \n430.  On or about February 17, 2021, Lt. Robinson again ordered Plaintiff Brinkley to attend a \nmental evaluation and assessment, as a final step in creating a hostile work environment and \njustifying the disparate treatment of Plaintiff Brinkley.  This directive was discrimination and \nharassment based on the perception that she had disability. \n431.  On or about February 19, 2021, Plaintiff Brinkley wrote to the District of Columbia City \nCouncil to complain about the discrimination and retaliation she was being subjected to, and to \ninform them of the systemic discrimination and lack of EEO support in the MPD. \n432.  On or about March 1, 2021, in furtherance of the campaign to harass Plaintiff Brinkley, \nCaptain Caron told her subordinates to direct Plaintiff Brinkley to respond to another request for a \nstatement related to a barricade that took place on or about February 23, 2021, and to answer \nspecific questions by the end of Plaintiffs’ shift.   \n433.  This request put Plaintiff Brinkley on notice that the Department was looking for yet \nanother reason to discharge her.  \n434.  On or about March 2, 2021, Union Steward Rosario replied to Captain Caron’s request via \nemail, stating that the request violated Article 13 of the Labor Agreement. \n435.  On or about March 8, 2021, the Plaintiff Brinkley received her Notice of Right to Sue letter \nfrom the EEOC.  \n68 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 69 of 219\n \n436.  On or about March 23, 2021, Plaintiff Brinkley attended a virtual meeting to dispute the \ndecision of the clinic that Plaintiff Brinkley’s anxiety and stress was “not work-related.”   \n437.  This was an entirely self-serving conclusion, designed to protect and give cover to the SOD \npersonnel who were engaged in an active and coordinated campaign against Plaintiff Brinkley.  \n438.  Again, Plaintiff Brinkley was the victim of coordinated retaliation which had the exact \neffect and outcome its perpetrators desired.  \n439.  On or about April 13, 2021, a grievance meeting was conducted to hear Plaintiff Brinkley’s \ngrievance related to her performance evaluation.   \n440.  Plaintiff Brinkley attended the meeting with MPO Brittingham, who was serving as her \nrepresentative.   \n441.  The grievance hearing panel consisted of Union Steward Rosario, Captain Sean Conboy \nand Sergeant Shavaun Ross.  The panel concluded and said they would get back to Plaintiff \nBrinkley within two weeks.  \n442.  On or about April 28, 2021, Sgt. Brown told Plaintiff Brinkley to report to Human Resource \nthe following day.  \n443.  When Plaintiff Brinkley asked Sgt. Brown why she needed to do so, he stated that he did \nnot know the reason for the meeting. \n444.  On or about April 29, 2021, Plaintiff Brinkley reported to Human Resources as directed, \nalong with her Union Steward Rosario.  \n445.  At that time, Plaintiff Brinkley was terminated from her employment, effective April 30, \n2021. \n446.  The facts alleged by Plaintiff Brinkley herein are representative, not exhaustive, of the kind \nof continuous, frequent and repeated and recurring disparate and unfair treatment, hostility, \n69 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 70 of 219\n \ndisparagement and retaliations she was forced to endure at MPD.  Additional facts in support of \nher claims will be developed in discovery.  \n          Plaintiff Brinkley’s Individual Causes of Action \n  Race Discrimination and Retaliation Claims \n447.  Plaintiff Brinkley incorporates and restates all of the previous factual allegations contained \nin this Complaint as if fully restated herein. \n448.  Plaintiff Brinkley, on her own behalf, asserts herein claims pursuant to Title VII of the \nCivil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e, et seq.;  the District of Columbia Human \nRights Act, District of Columbia Code § 2-1401.01 et seq., and the Civil Rights Act of 1866 \nDiscrimination Based on Race in the Making and Enforcing of Contracts 42 U.S.C. §1981(a) by \nway of, through and via 42 U.S.C. § 1983. \n449.  Plaintiff Brinkley was treated disparately, subjected to a hostile work environment and \nretaliated against for complaining about and opposing the race discrimination to which she was \nsubjected.  \n450.  The facts alleged above constitute discrimination, and systematic retaliation severe and \npervasive enough to be compensable. \n451.  The facts alleged above, taken in conjunction with the facts alleged by the other nine (9) \nCRPs, establish that Defendant maintained a pattern, practice and custom of race discrimination \nagainst Black women police officers on the basis of race.  \n452.  The facts alleged by Plaintiff Brinkley that establish that she was treated disparately than \nher non-Black-female colleagues, are typical of, and consistent with, the claims of the other nine \n(9) CRPs. \n70 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 71 of 219\n \n453.  Plaintiff Brinkley asserts that she was subjected to a hostile work environment because of \nher race, which deteriorated and became more hostile because of her protected activity, and in \nretaliation for her complaints regarding race discrimination. \n454.  As a direct and proximate cause of the hostile work environment fostered by Defendant, \nPlaintiff Brinkley was humiliated, embarrassed and made to endure constant stress and anxiety, \ndepression, lack of sleep and other symptoms that caused her severe mental anguish.   \n455.  Plaintiff Brinkley has incurred lost wages, loss of reputation and loss of career opportunity \nnow and into the future, and all the other losses stated herein. \n456.  Plaintiff Brinkley seeks compensatory damages, and damages for mental pain and \nsuffering, above and beyond recovery as a member of the class, of not less than $300,000.00 plus \ninterest, costs, fees and all other remedies the Court deems appropriate.  \n  Sex Discrimination and Retaliation Claims \n457.  Plaintiff Brinkley incorporates and restates all of the previous factual allegations \ncontained in this Complaint as if fully restated herein. \n458.  Plaintiff Brinkley, on her own behalf, asserts herein claims pursuant to Title VII of the \nCivil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e, et seq., and the District of Columbia \nHuman Rights Act, District of Columbia Code § 2-1401.01 et seq. \n459.  Plaintiff Brinkley was treated disparately, subjected to a hostile work environment and \nretaliated against for complaining about and opposing the gender discrimination she was subjected \nto.  \n460.  The facts alleged above constitute discrimination, and systematic retaliation severe and \npervasive enough to be compensable. \n71 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 72 of 219\n \n461.  The facts alleged above, taken in conjunction with the facts alleged by the other nine (9) \nCRPs, establish that Defendant maintained a pattern and practice of discrimination against Black \nwomen police officers on the basis of sex.  \n462.  Plaintiff Brinkley asserts that she was subjected to a hostile work environment because of \nher sex, which deteriorated and became more hostile because of her protected activity, and in \nretaliation for her complaints regarding sex discrimination.  \n463.  The facts alleged by Plaintiff Brinkley that establish that she was treated disparately than \nher male colleagues are typical of, and consistent with, the claims of the other nine (9) CRPs. \n464.  As a direct and proximate cause of the hostile work environment fostered by Defendant, \nPlaintiff Brinkley was humiliated, embarrassed and made to endure constant stress and anxiety, \ndepression, lack of sleep and other symptoms that caused her severe mental anguish.   \n465.  Plaintiff Brinkley has incurred lost wages, loss of reputation and loss of career opportunity \nnow and into the future, and all the other losses stated herein. \n466.  Plaintiff  Brinkley  seeks  compensatory  damages,  and  damages  for  mental  pain  and \nsuffering, above and beyond recovery as a member of the class, of not less than $300,000.00 plus \ninterest, costs, fees and all other remedies the Court deems appropriate. \n            Whistleblower Retaliation Claim \n467.  Plaintiff Brinkley incorporates and restates all information and allegations contained in \nthe preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n468.  Pursuant to the District of Columbia Whistleblower Protection Act D.C. Code § 1-615-51 \net seq., Defendants are prohibited from reassigning, terminating or otherwise retaliating against a \nD.C. government employee as a result of that employee’s protected disclosures that the employee \nreasonably believes show gross mismanagement, gross misuse or waste of government resources, \n72 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 73 of 219\n \nand abuse of authority in the connection with the administration of a government program, or a \nviolation of a state, local or federal law, rule or regulation.  \n469.  Plaintiff Brinkley was an employee who, as a result of her disclosures to her supervisors, \nthe senior leadership of her department, the EEO Department of the MPD, Assistant Chief Caron, \nChief Newsham, the District of Columbia City Council, the Office of the Mayor and the EEOC \nabout the systemic discrimination in the MPD, and the complicity of the MPD EEO Department \nin perpetuating it and protecting those who engage in it, ethical violations that included leaking \nconfidential  witness  statements,  the  creation  of  a  chilling  and  retaliatory  work  culture  that \ndiscouraged officers from complaining about mistreatment and inappropriate police conduct, \nenjoyed the protection of DCWPA.  \n470.  As a direct result of Plaintiff Brinkley’s protected disclosures, Defendants systematically \nand continuously retaliated against Plaintiff, including but not limited to unwarranted disciplinary \nactions against Plaintiff, isolation and separation from coworkers, unfavorable treatment and \nassignments, false and inaccurate performance evaluation and ultimately termination. \n471.  Plaintiff Brinkley asserts that she was subjected to a hostile work environment because of \nher protected activity, and in retaliation for her complaints regarding unlawful discrimination. \n472.  As a result of Defendants’ actions, Plaintiff Brinkley suffered significant economic harm \nin the form of loss of employment, corresponding salary, loss of employment opportunities, \ndamage to her professional reputation, and significant mental and emotional distress. \n473.  Plaintiff Brinkley was humiliated, embarrassed and made to endure constant stress and \nanxiety, depression, lack of sleep and other symptoms that required her to seek professional \ntreatment, and that materially caused her severe mental anguish. \n73 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 74 of 219\n \n474.  Plaintiff Brinkley has incurred lost wages, loss of reputation and loss of career opportunity \nnow and into the future, and all the other losses stated herein. \n475.  Plaintiff Brinkley herein seeks compensatory damages, and damages for mental pain and \nsuffering of not less than $1,000,000.00, plus interest, costs, fees and all other remedies the Court \ndeems appropriate. \n        Age Discrimination and Retaliation Claim \n476.  Plaintiff Brinkley incorporates and restates all information and allegations contained in the \npreceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n477.  Plaintiff Brinkley was a person qualified to be a police officer, and held the position for \nmore than 30 years.  \n478.  Plaintiff Brinkley asserts that she was discriminated against and retaliated against, in part, \nbecause of her age (over 40), in violation of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act 29 U.S.C. \n§§ 621-634, and the DCHRA, D.C. Code § 2-1401.01 et seq. \n479.  At least in part, because of her age, Plaintiff Brinkley, a Senior Police Officer was denied \nsick leave, weekend days off, duty assignments, training, and health assessments, while these same \nopportunities and benefits were given to much younger police officers. \n480.  At least in part, Plaintiff Brinkley was terminated from her employment because of her age, \nand the reasons given for her termination were false and pretextual to hide a discriminatory intent.  \n481.  MPD’s termination of Plaintiff Brinkley was motivated, at least in part, to retaliate against  \nher for opposing age discrimination at MPD.  \n482.  Plaintiff Brinkley asserts that she was subjected to a hostile work environment because of \nher age, which deteriorated and became more hostile because of her protected activity, and in \nretaliation for her complaints regarding age discrimination. \n74 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 75 of 219\n \n483.  On information and belief, Plaintiff Brinkley asserts that she was replaced by an officer \nwho was significantly younger than her. \n484.  Plaintiff Brinkley asserts that the members of MPD management who were not pleased \nwith the number of SPOs in SOD took action to discriminate against her, at least in part, because \nof her age.  \n485.  Plaintiff Brinkley was humiliated, embarrassed and made to endure constant stress and \nanxiety, depression, lack of sleep and other symptoms that materially caused her severe mental \nanguish.  \n486.  Plaintiff Brinkley has incurred lost wages, loss of reputation and loss of career opportunity \nnow and into the future, and all the other losses stated herein. \n487.  Plaintiff Brinkley herein seeks compensatory damages, and damages for mental pain and \nsuffering of not less than $300,000.00 plus interest, costs, fees and all other remedies the Court \ndeems appropriate. \n     Disability Discrimination and Retaliation Claim \n488.  Plaintiff Brinkley incorporates and restates all information and allegations contained in the \npreceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n489.  Plaintiff Brinkley was a person qualified to be a police officer, and held the position for \nmore than 30 years.  \n490.  Plaintiff Brinkley asserts herein that MPD violated her rights under the Americans with \nDisabilities Act of 1990, 42 U.S.C. 126, § 12101 et seq., and the DCHRA, D.C. Code § 2-1431.01, \net seq. \n75 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 76 of 219\n \n491.  After the death of her husband, Plaintiff Brinkley suffered from depression and an anxiety \ncondition for which she was under the care of medical professionals, and which was known to the \nDefendant, and as such, is a member of a protected class. \n492.  Federal and D.C. law prohibits employers from discriminating against qualified individuals \nbecause of a disability “in regard to job application procedures, the hiring, advancement or \ndischarge of employees, employment compensation, job training, and other terms, conditions, and \nprivileges of employment.”  \n493.  Plaintiff Brinkley’s disability substantially limited at least one of Plaintiff Brinkley’s major \nlife activities, sleeping.  Plaintiff Brinkley is an individual with a disability under the ADA. \n494.  On several occasions, as described above, Defendant asked Plaintiff Brinkley inappropriate \nquestions about her disability, and commented about her disability to her colleagues and co-\nworkers.  \n495.  On one occasion, as a result of having an episode related to depression and anxiety, Plaintiff \nBrinkley’s supervisor made negative comments about her to her colleagues and threatened to send \nher for a fitness for duty evaluation, which was intended to be, and was a threat to her future \nemployment and a reprisal for her suffering from a disability.  \n496.  When Plaintiff Brinkley complained about her serious and legitimate concerns regarding \nher Department’s failure to comply with CDC guidelines regarding personnel entering the SOD \nbuilding, she was ignored or humiliated for raising the issue.  Later, management disciplined her \nfor not obtaining a health assessment upon entering the building, when it was her management that \nfailed to station a person at the entrance to conduct the assessment. \n76 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 77 of 219\n \n497.  Defendant’s actions were intended to mock Plaintiff Brinkley for suffering from anxiety, \nand to add to exasperate her condition by forcing her to be even more worried for her health due \nto potential exposure to COVID-19. \n498.  On three occasions, as described above, Plaintiff Brinkley was exposed to COVID-19 from \ncolleagues who had tested positive and was forced to quarantine as a result.  Each such instance \nwas the result of Defendant’s lackadaisical attitude to compliance with CDC COVID-19 protocols. \n499.  On at least two occasions, personal and confidential information about Plaintiff Brinkley’s \nmental health condition and disability was discussed or leaked to her colleagues by her supervisors, \ncausing Plaintiff Brinkley’s co-workers to not want to work with her, and shaming Plaintiff \nBrinkley and creating a stigma related to her disability. \n500.  In February of 2021, Plaintiff Brinkley was again sent for a mental health evaluation for \npurpose of humiliating her, and finding a reason to terminate her employment.  \n501.  Defendant’s actions constituted disparate and discriminatory treatment that caused Plaintiff \nBrinkley to suffer and punished her for having a disability. \n502.  Plaintiff Brinkley asserts that Defendant, over a period of of years, created a hostile work \nenvironment for her because it perceived her to have a mental disability, and that this hostile work \nenvironment  began  when  she  returned  from  bereavement  leave,  and  continued  until  her \ntermination. \n503.  Plaintiff Brinkley asserts that the hostile work environment she endured because of her \ndisability and/or the perception of her disability, deteriorated and became more hostile because \nof her protected activity, and in retaliation for her complaints regarding disability discrimination. \n77 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 78 of 219\n \n504.  Plaintiff Brinkley was humiliated, embarrassed and made to endure constant stress and \nanxiety, depression, lack of sleep and other symptoms that required her to seek professional \ntreatment, and that materially caused her severe mental anguish.   \n505.  Plaintiff Brinkley has incurred lost wages, loss of reputation and loss of career opportunity \nnow and into the future, and all the other losses stated herein. \n506.  Plaintiff Brinkley herein seeks compensatory damages, and damages for mental pain and \nsuffering of not less than $300,000, plus interest, costs, fees and all other remedies the Court deems \nappropriate. \n                     PLAINTIFF BROWN’S INDIVIDUAL CLAIMS \n      Facts Relevant to Plaintiff Brown’s Individual Claims \n507.  Plaintiff Brown began her employment with the MPD in 2015. \n508.  Plaintiff Brown was mountain-bike certified, a process that took substantial effort and \nexcellent physical fitness. Cdr. Taylor, therefore asked her to maximize her time patrolling her turf \nby bicycle, which allowed Plaintiff to have close proximity to the community. \n509.  During the first year of her employment, she was appointed the Community Patrol Officer \nin a neighborhood known as Fairfax Village.  \n510.  This beat was historically given to an officer with years of experience, and was viewed by \nmany officers as a desirable assignment.  \n511.  The Fairfax Village community had specifically asked the Departmental Commander \nDavid Taylor (hereinafter “Cdr. Taylor”), that Plaintiff Brown be assigned to that beat.   \n512.  Plaintiff Brown’s schedule for the Fairfax Village beat was somewhat unusual, in that it \nsplit shifts.  She came in after day shift roll call, and worked into the evening on night shift.  She \nwas therefore supervised by Sergeants on two different shifts. \n78 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 79 of 219\n \n513.  From approximately 2015 to early 2019, the Departmental Lieutenant was Jonathan Munk \n(hereinafter “Lt. Munk”), who reported to directly to Cdr. Taylor because all of the Departmental \nCaptains remained in a different section.  \n514.  Several of Plaintiff Brown’s fellow officers, and the day shift Sergeants Robert Drummond \n(hereinafter “Sgt. Drummond”) and Sergeant James Weathersby (hereinafter “Sgt. Weathersby”) \nresented that Plaintiff Brown was given such a desirable assignment, and responded by harassing, \ndenigrating, undermining and bullying her on the job. \n515.  Most importantly, Plaintiff Brown’s direct supervisors constantly tried to impede her from \npatrolling the community by bike, and assigned her to patrol by car, informing Plaintiff Brown \nthat she needed to “earn the right” to patrol Fairfax Village by bicycle.  \n516.  There was no MPD policy requiring that an officer has to “earn the right” to any beat or \npatrol area, and Plaintiff Brown’s supervisors had no basis to make such a demand of her.  \n517.  When Plaintiff Brown reminded her Sergeants Drummond and Weathersby that she had \nqualified to patrol by bicycle, and was personally requested by the Fairfax Village community, \nthey would tell Plaintiff that she was subject to their power and would have to do what they wanted.  \n518.  There was no legitimate reason or justification for the way Plaintiff Brown’s supervisors \ntreated her. \n519.  When Plaintiff Brown brought her concerns about being bullied and denied the benefit of \na positive assignment to the attention of Lt. Munk, the Lieutenant attempted to intercede.  But he \nwas not always there, and he had little power in the department. \n520.  As soon as the coast was clear, Plaintiff Brown’s supervising Sergeants retaliated against \nher for going up the chain of command by escalating the harassment and bullying.  \n79 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 80 of 219\n \n521.  On one occasion in 2018, Sgt. Michael Grey (hereinafter “Sgt. Grey”), another Sergeant \non day shift, took Plaintiff Brown’s radio, an essential piece of equipment and hid it for an entire \nshift, and told her that she should not have left it unattended and unsecured in the police station.  \n522.  This was an uncalled-for act of demeaning bullying of Plaintiff Brown because the station \nwas a secured location which was attended by the station clerk, who watched over all of the radios \nthat were placed on the radio charger. All of the Department’s officers left their radios in that \nlocation to be charged. \n523.  Sgt. Grey did not take anyone’s radio except Plaintiff Brown’s.  Even radios that were left \nfor several days because the officers were scheduled off were left untouched.  \n524.  Plaintiff Brown was also targeted by her fellow officers for bullying through small acts of \nmicro-aggressions such as repeatedly taking her lunch.  She was the only officer on either shift \nwho was treated that way. \n525.  Plaintiff Brown’s supervising Sergeants were aware that she was being bullied by her \nfellow  officers,  and  instead  of  preventing  it,  they  actually  permitted  and  encouraged  such \nunprofessional behavior.  \n526.  The lack of basic respect from her fellow officers made Plaintiff Brown feel isolated and \nas if she could not rely on their support and back-up. \n527.  Plaintiff Brown considered going to EEO to complain, but was intimidated out of doing it \nbecause she had heard that  others who went to EEO were retaliated against. \n528.  As a relatively junior officer, Plaintiff Brown did not feel she had the standing to challenge \nher superiors. \n529.  Plaintiff Brown suffered small acts of disrespect and unprofessional bullying nearly every \nday, and was treated as a second-class citizen in her department because of her race and gender.  \n80 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 81 of 219\n \n530.  While Plaintiff Brown continued to suffer within the workplace, her relationship with \ncommunity continued to get stronger because of her proactive approach to policing. \n531.  Every other weekend Plaintiff Brown would buy pizza for the people who were regulars in \nher patrol area. She would buy cases of water for the homeless people and put water in a cooler \nand pass it out on Fridays and Saturdays.  \n532.  Plaintiff Brown would make care packages with socks, water, snacks and sanitary items in \nthem and hand out to the homeless.  \n533.  Plaintiff Brown often chose to do these positive things for the community while in uniform \nso that people would develop a positive view of police officers.  \n534.  Plaintiff Brown’s positive approach to policing  made her an outcast amongst several of \nher co-workers, most especially white male officers.  \n535.  Many would tell her that she was wasting her time and was foolish for trying to help  people \nin the community.  \n536.  For years during her employment, Plaintiff Brown’s fellow officers would write about her \non a Facebook page called the MPD Forum.  \n537.  The other officers would say things like Plaintiff Brown was a fake police officer, that she \ndidn't work, and that she was a “part-time” cop.  \n538.  The campaign to cyber-bully Plaintiff Brown began with white male police officers, and \nthen was joined by Black male officers.   \n539.  Several MPD Sergeants and Lieutenants were on the forum and participated in the cyber-\nbullying aimed at Plaintiff because of her race and gender. \n540.  In 2019 Plaintiff Brown was selected as MPD Officer of the Year for the previous year, \ndue to her hard work in community service and improving community relations.   \n81 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 82 of 219\n \n541.  Once she received the honor of Officer of the Year, the bullying from her fellow officers \nescalated. \n542.  Additionally, at that time, a change in leadership occurred.  Lt. Munk was replaced by Lt. \nHawkins. \n543.  Plaintiff Brown was frequently denigrated and disrespected during roll call meetings, in \nfull view of her departmental Sergeants. \n544.  Rather  than  insisting  on  a  professional  and  respectful  workplace,  Plaintiff  Brown’s \nsupervisors  and  managers  fostered  and  encouraged  a  hostile,  attacking,  and  bullying  work \nenvironment. \n545.  At some point after Plaintiff Brown was awarded the Officer Of The Year award, a \nsignificant break down of the chain of command occurred. \n546.  Plaintiff  Brown’s  Departmental  Commander  at  that  time  was  Darriya  Habbebulah \n(hereinafter “Cdr. Habbebulah”), a Black woman officer.  \n547.  Cdr. Habbebbulah made it clear to her subordinate Lieutenants and Sergeants that she \nwanted Plaintiff to spend as much time in the Fairfax Village community as possible, cruising in \nthe specially marked vehicle Plaintiff Brown was awarded as Officer of the Year.  \n548.  Cdr. Habbebbulah  even had a bike rack placed on Plaintiff Brown’s car so she could park \nthe car and ride around the neighborhoods.  \n549.  Not only was Cdr. Habbebbulah’s order disregarded, but there was no discipline or \nconsequences for the Sergeants and Lieutenants who defied it. \n550.  Eventually, Plaintiff Brown was involuntarily moved from the Fairfax Village beat without \nexplanation or justification.  \n551.  When Plaintiff Brown was taken from the Fairfax Village beat, crime went up significantly.  \n82 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 83 of 219\n \n552.  Despite being involuntarily reassigned, the daily and systematic bullying of Plaintiff \nBrown did not improve. \n553.  The situation deteriorated so much that the bullying bled over into the workplace, and \nPlaintiff  Brown felt she had to report it.  She reached to Assistant Chief Chanel Dickerson, who \ninitiated an investigation into the forum.  \n554.  At the time, the forum was rife with comments of a racist and sexist nature, posted by \nofficers who were ostensibly supposed to serve the community in an unbiased manner. \n555.  IAD conducted the investigation of the forum, and it was ultimately shut down.  As far as \nPlaintiff is aware, no officers were disciplined for their comments or activities on the forum, \nincluding their bullying of Plaintiff.  \n556.  In 2019, Plaintiff Brown’s department received a complaint about her, but the name and \nemail address of the complainant were fictitious.  \n557.  It was not lost on Plaintiff Brown that shortly after the MPD Forum was investigated and \nshut down, she became the subject of an investigation.  \n558.  The “anonymous” complaint against Plaintiff Brown contained allegations that made it \nclear it came from within the MPD, and was rife with unfounded accusations.   \n559.  The gravamen of the complaint was that Plaintiff Brown wasn’t making enough arrests and \ngetting enough weapons off of the street. It was essentially denigrating her for being too friendly \nand kind to the community. \n560.  Despite the obvious bias of the “anonymous” complaint, Plaintiff Brown was nevertheless \nplaced under investigation.   \n561.  Plaintiff Brown was ultimately cleared of any wrongdoing, but had to endure the stress and \nuncertainty of being the subject of a frivolous and unjustified investigation. \n83 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 84 of 219\n \n562.  Plaintiff Brown had experienced the culture of intimidation when she attempted to report \nto Lt. Preston an incident that Plaintiff Brown observed, of what she believed to be illegal stop and \nfrisk activity. \n563.  The incident involved plain-clothes officers from another unit, who cruised into Plaintiff’s \nbeat area, came up to a group of young Black men, jumped out of the vehicle, lined the young men \nup against a gate, and started emptying their pockets, without any radio call or Be On The Lookout \n(hereinafter “BOLO”) notice related to an incident.  \n564.  Plaintiff Brown believed that this incident was unlawful, and attempted to report it. \n565.  Lt. Preston listened to Plaintiff Brown’s recounting, and asked Plaintiff Brown if she would \nwrite a formal statement. \n566.  Then, Lt. Preston told Plaintiff that the officers involved were going to be told who reported \n(“snitched”) them, and then asked Plaintiff Brown again, if she wanted to bother with a formal \nreport.  Plaintiff Brown interpreted that as a warning to keep silent, and therefore kept silent.  \n567.  Under MPD rules and polices, Lt. Preston herself had a duty to report the incident, and \nshould have escalated the matter, rather said something that encouraged Plaintiff not to pursue the \nmatter.  \n568.  In addition to, and compounding the day-to-day stress that Plaintiff Brown felt from the \nconstant harassment and belittling she endured on the job, an incident occurred that deeply \ndisturbed her, related to an officer-involved shooting occurred in the 7th District.  \n569.  Plaintiff Brown was on duty and was deployed from the Police Academy to the 7th District \nPolice Station.  \n84 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 85 of 219\n \n570.  The community was protesting in front of the building because an officer had shot and \nkilled a young African American male, and the crowd was agitated by a false rumor that the officer \nhad shot the young man in the back.  \n571.  When Plaintiff Brown arrived on scene, the heated  and angry crowd was attempting to \nbreak into the station.  \n572.  Plaintiff Brown and her fellow officers placed themselves around the building to make a \nprotective barricade, and held that post for hours.  \n573.  At approximately midnight, the size of the crowd had grown significantly,  but the push to \nbreach the building had completely stopped, and the perimeter was not being challenged.  \n574.  The crowd was still angry and upset, it was flashing lights in the faces of the officers, and  \nchanting BLM. Plaintiff Brown saw that many people were crying and extremely upset,  but none \nof the protesters were being physical or violent with the officers on the perimeter.  \n575.  At the same time, Plaintiff Brown observed several white officers taunting the citizens and \nflashing their lights in their eyes and acting very unprofessional.  \n576.  Plaintiff Brown observed white officers smacking their lips, laughing at the protesters and \ntaunting them.  \n577.  One protester looked at her and said \"Brown look, they are laughing at the fact that a black \nboy is dead. They don't even care Brown, he looked just like you, his skin matched your skin, and \nthey are laughing Brown,” or words to that effect. \n578.  Observing  her  fellow officers treat  the  community with  the kind  of racial bias and \ndisrespect that they treated her, and other Black women police officers in the MPD, constituted \nthe final straw for her, and promoted Plaintiff Brown to resign from the MPD. \n85 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 86 of 219\n \n579.  The facts alleged by Plaintiff Brown herein are representative, not exhaustive, of the kind \nof  continuous,  frequent,  repeated  and  recurring  disparate  and  unfair  treatment,  hostility, \ndisparagement and retaliations she was forced to endure at MPD.  Additional facts in support of \nher claims will be developed in discovery. \n  Plaintiff Brown’s Individual Causes of Action \n  Race Discrimination and Retaliation Claims \n580.

Pursuant to the District of Columbia Whistleblower Protection Act D.C. Code § 1-615-51 \net seq., Defendants are prohibited from reassigning, terminating or otherwise retaliating against a \nD.C. government employee as a result of that employee’s protected disclosures that the employee \nreasonably believes show gross mismanagement, gross misuse or waste of government resources, \n88 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 89 of 219\n \nand abuse of authority in the connection with the administration of a government program, or a \nviolation of a state, local or federal law, rule or regulation.  \n602.  Plaintiff Brown engaged in protected disclosures when she reported police misconduct to \nLt. Preston, and race and gender harassment to her Asst. Chief. \n603.  Plaintiff Brown asserts that she was subjected to a hostile work environment in retaliation \nfor her protected disclosures and complaints regarding race discrimination. \n604.  As a direct result of Plaintiff Brown protected disclosures, Defendants systematically and \ncontinuously  retaliated  against  Plaintiff  Brown,  including  but  not  limited  to  unwarranted \ndisciplinary  actions  against  Plaintiff,  isolation  and  separation  from  coworkers,  unfavorable \ntreatment  and  assignments,  false  and  inaccurate  performance  evaluation  and  ultimately \ntermination. \n605.

Plaintiff Carr began her employment with MPD in April of 1998.   \n610.  Plaintiff Carr was one of only three (3) Black female officers in her class of predominately \nwhite men, and one Black man.  \n611.  Despite the imbalance of her class, and a pattern of sexist and racist comments, and acts \nof favoritism shown the white male trainees, Plaintiff Carr was selected to be a squad leader for a \nportion of the training. \n612.  After her time at the police academy, Plaintiff Carr was assigned to the Sixth District Police \nStation.  \n613.  At the time of her initial training and during her first MPD assignment, Plaintiff Carr was \na United States Army National Guard soldier.  Her Army specialty was as a vehicle repair \nspecialist. \n614.  As such, she was required to drive to Ft. Pickett, Virginia one weekend per month to fulfill \nher reserve duties and obligations.  \n615.  Plaintiff Carr had completed four (4) years of active-duty services in the United States \nArmy before joining the MPD, and it was her desire and intention to serve in the reserve component \nfor a full twenty (20) year career, and to earn a full reservist retirement with all benefits related \nthereto.    \n616.  Despite the fact that her service in the Army Reserve was protected by Federal Law, the \nSixth District leadership refused to work with her to fulfill her obligation, forcing her to remain on \nduty late on Fridays when she had reserve drill, thus incumbering her ability to reach Ft. Pickett \non time.  \n90 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 91 of 219\n \n617.  Furthermore, even though Plaintiff Carr had leave to complete her two-weeks-per-year \nreserve obligation, and the fact that such service is protected by law, the Commander of the 6th \nDistrict to  made it very challenging to get the time off that she needed. \n618.  The obstacles and push-back Plaintiff Carr received from her superiors when it came to \nfulfilling her reserve duty became so stressful, that she ultimately had to resign from the Army \nReserve, and relinquish and abandon the time-in-service equity she had built towards a full 20-\nyear reservist retirement. \n619.  At the time, several male MPD officers were also military reservists, and were given both \nthe time off, and all reasonable accommodation needed to fulfill their reserve without difficulty.  \n620.  When Plaintiff Carr complained to her leadership about the disparity in treatment, her \nconcerns were ignored.  \n621.  This was the first serious circumstance in Plaintiff Carr’s career at  MPD when her \nmanagement subjected Plaintiff to unequal and disparate terms and conditions of employment \nbased on her race and gender.  \n622.  MPD offered Plaintiff  Carr no recourse to address the disparate treatment from her \nleadership, and established a pattern of dismissing and ignoring concerns raised by Plaintiff.   \n623.  From 2001-2002, Plaintiff  Carr was detailed to the Harbor Patrol Branch of MPD during \na recovery from knee surgery.    \n624.  Plaintiff  Carr did an excellent job while in that department, and the Harbor Master at the \ntime Lt. Paul  Niepling (hereinafter  “Lt. Niepling”), requested that Plaintiff be permanently \nassigned to the Harbor Patrol Branch.  \n625.  Plaintiff  Carr asked her leadership for the permanent reassignment, but her request was \ndenied.  No explanation was given to Plaintiff  Carr for the denial of her request.  \n91 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 92 of 219\n \n626.  Instead, a male officer was assigned to the Harbor Patrol Branch and Plaintiff  Carr was \nsent back to the Sixth District.   \n627.  Plaintiff Carr asserts and alleges that she was denied a desirable job opportunity because \nof her race  and gender, and that such denial had a  continuing  effect  on her  earnings  and \npromotional opportunities.  \n628.  In 2002 Plaintiff Carr attempted to expand her developmental and job opportunities by \napplying to be a helicopter pilot. \n629.  Plaintiff Carr took the swim test and was one of the only female police officers to pass the \nstrenuous test.  \n630.  Plaintiff Carr successfully passed all of the interview and testing components of the \nselection process, and was selected for the position, which was posted by teletype announcing \nPlaintiff as selected for the Air Support Unit.  \n631.  The departmental Sergeant, Steve Smith (hereinafter “Sgt. Smith), a white male, was \nunhappy that Plaintiff had been selected over a white male that Sgt. Smith favored, and accused \nPlaintiff, without evidence of any kind, of cheating on the swim test.  \n632.  The swim test portion was monitored by Lt. Niepling of Harbor Patrol, and several other \nsupervisors were present.  None of the people who witnessed the test accused Plaintiff Carr of any \nimpropriety with respect to the swim test.  \n633.  While this dispute regarding assignment to the Air Support Branch was transpiring, in \n2003, Plaintiff Carr applied to be transferred to the Patrol K9 Unit and the EOD K-9 Unit, to have \nan opportunity to work with police dogs. \n634.  Plaintiff Carr was selected to take the EOD K-9 training test, but never received the notice \nto report to the Physical Training (“PT”) part of the test.   \n92 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 93 of 219\n \n635.  Plaintiff Carr later discovered that Commander William Dandridge (hereinafter “Cdr. \nDandridge”), intentionally sabotaged her from  getting the notification of the test in order to take \nfrom her the opportunity to go to the EOD K-9 unit.  \n636.  Plaintiff Carr went directly to (then) Cdr. Cathy Lanier, who was the Commander of SOD \nat the time, to complain about what had happened, and was told that there was nothing that could \nbe done, and that she should focus on patrol duties.  \n637.  No investigation or disciplinary action was taken against Cdr. Dandridge for sabotaging \nPlaintiff Carr’s opportunity by MPD management.  Plaintiff Carr’s concern and complaint was \nsimply ignored. \n638.  By chance, a few weeks later, one of Plaintiff Carr’s colleagues (not Plaintiff’s supervisor \nor management team) informed her of the date and time of an upcoming PT test for the Patrol K-\n9 Unit. \n639.  Plaintiff Carr was the only female officer who was able to pass the PT portion of the K-9 \ntest and advance to the interview portion for selection.  \n640.  Plaintiff Carr, who had a side job as a dog groomer, received one of the highest scores \nduring  the  interview  portion  because  of  her  extensive  knowledge  of  dogs,  and  held  two \ncertifications for dog grooming and handling.  \n641.  Despite her strong testing and performance, Sergeant Duane Beuthe (hereinafter “Sgt \nBeuthe”)  interceded to keep Plaintiff from being transferred to the Patrol K-9 unit.   \n642.  When asked about his objection to Plaintiff Carr going to Patrol K-9 Unit, Sgt. Beuthe \nindicated that the work of the Patrol K-9 Unit was too rigorous, and that Plaintiff Carr would be \nbetter suited to the EOD K-9 unit because it did “less work.” \n93 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 94 of 219\n \n643.  Plaintiff Carr asserts that Sgt. Beuthe had a problem with female officers being in the K-9 \nPatrol unit, and acted to limit the job opportunities for women officers who wanted to work with \npolice dogs.  \n644.  Plaintiff Carr immediately complained about the unfair and disparate treatment that she \nwas being subjected to, speaking with her union representative Bernard Richardson, to see if she \nhad recourse under the terms of the collective bargaining agreement.   \n645.  Plaintiff Carr filed a grievance over the unfair treatment with the support of her union.  \n646.  Because Plaintiff Carr was willing to escalate the matter and speak out against the gender \nbias within the K-9 Patrol Unit, she was labeled a “trouble-maker” and subjected to systematic and \nrepetitive retaliation.  \n647.  Plaintiff Carr, with the assistance of her union, again escalated matters to Cdr. Lanier  \nexplaining that she was being discriminated against in by both the Air Support Branch and the K-\n9 Units, because of her race and gender.  \n648.  In order to appease Plaintiff Carr, and get her to drop her grievance, Cdr. Lanier agreed to \ngive Plaintiff Carr her choice of the Air Support Unit or the K-9 Unit.  \n649.  However, Cdr. Lanier discouraged Plaintiff Carr from choosing the Air Support Unit by \nwarning Plaintiff Carr of the challenges of working for a sexist Sergeant.   \n650.  Cdr. Lanier did not take any action to address Sgt. Smith or Sgt. Beuthe’s discriminatory \nactions or attitudes. \n651.  Plaintiff chose the K-9 Unit, but was denied K-9 Patrol, even though she had earned a \nposition in that Unit, and settled for the EOD K-9 Unit. Plaintiff Carr went to EOD K-9 Unit in \n2003. \n94 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 95 of 219\n \n652.  In 2006, Plaintiff Carr filed an OHR complaint alleging gender discrimination, because she \nwas consistently treated less favorably than male officers in the SOD K-9 Unit.  \n653.  Plaintiff Carr’s complaint was not taken seriously, and was dismissed without thorough \ninvestigation.  \n654.  Immediately  thereafter,  Plaintiff  Carr  was  subjected  to  an  even  more  hostile  work \nenvironment, suffering from snide and sexist comments from her co-workers, and even more \nunfavorable treatment.  \n655.  Importantly, no disciplinary action was taken against Sgt. Smith or Sgt. Greg Jackson \n(hereinafter “Sgt. Jackson”) for the blatantly sexist and discriminatory treatment of Plaintiff Carr.  \n656.  No disciplinary action was taken against Sgt. Smith for maligning Plaintiff Carr’s character \nand defaming her by falsely accusing her of cheating on the Air Support swim test.  \n657.  In 2010, Plaintiff Carr position in the EOD K-9 Unit was unilaterally eliminated by \nmanagement, and despite a still-pending union grievance on the matter, Plaintiff was transferred \nto the Special Events Branch in 2011.  \n658.  Plaintiff Carr continued to suffer from retaliation and a hostile work environment while in \nSpecial Events Branch, but was afraid to file another EEO complaint because of the retaliation she \nsuffered from the 2006 complaint.  \n659.  In 2014, at the request of Cdr. Steven Sund (hereinafter “Capt. Sund), Plaintiff Carr was \ntransferred to the Administrative Office.  \n660.  However, when Cdr. Sund retired,  (then) Captain  Robert Glover  (hereinafter  “Capt. \nGlover”) began taking steps to force Plaintiff Carr out of the Administrative Department and \nreplace her with a white male officer, Robert Wells (hereinafter “Officer Wells”).  \n95 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 96 of 219\n \n661.  Plaintiff Carr successfully completed her job duties in the Administrative Department, \nwithout serious error or the need for substantial revision of her work, for three years.   \n662.  Yet, the excuse that Capt. Glover gave for replacing Plaintiff Carr with Officer Wells was \nthat  Officer  Wells  was  “college  educated.”  A  college  degree  was  never  required,  or  even \nparticularly relevant, for the position. \n663.  Plaintiff Carr was then transferred against her wishes to the Special Events/Escort Unit \nfrom the Administrative Department in 2016, and the hostile and unfair treatment aimed at Plaintiff \nCarr continued.  \n664.  In 2019, Plaintiff Carr filed an EEO complaint alleging unfair treatment, disparate terms \nand conditions of employment, and a hostile work environment.   \n665.  Because MPD’s EEO Officer, Mr. Lee had a practice of leaking what complainants said in \nEEO interviews, Plaintiff Carr’s accusations against Lt. Andrew Margiotta (hereinafter “Lt. \nMargiotta”) and Capt. Glover made it immediately back to them.  Thereafter, the retaliation against \nPlaintiff Carr began to escalate.   \n666.  It increased so much that Plaintiff Carr went directly to the Chief of Homeland Security \nBureau (hereinafter “HSB”), Jeffrey Carroll (hereinafter “Chief Carroll”) to complain.   \n667.  Chief Carroll dismissed and ignored Plaintiff Carr’s complaints, and took no action against \neither Sgt. James Rogers (hereinafter “Sgt. Rogers”) or Lt. Margiotta, both white male officers, \nfor their consistent and concerted efforts to bully Plaintiff Carr, and undermine her ability to do \nher job. \n668.  Plaintiff  Carr’s  supervisors  routinely  withheld  vital  information  from  her,  gave  her \nundesirable assignments that they would not give to others, issued discipline for small mistakes \n96 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 97 of 219\n \nthat were not subject to discipline when other officers made the same mistakes, and unfairly and \nharshly evaluated Plaintiff Carr’s performance.  \n669.  For  example,  Sgt.  Rogers  unilaterally  revoked  Plaintiff  Carr’s  “expected  tardiness \nprivilege,” which is given to officers to allow them to manage their respective schedules, when \nnecessary, without punishment.   \n670.  Sgt. Rogers had absolutely no basis for doing so. Plaintiff Carr had zero tardies during that \nperiod, so she had in no way abused the privilege.   \n671.  The revocation was just an act of unnecessary and disparate harshness against Plaintiff \nCarr.  \n672.  Plaintiff  Carr  was  systematically  attacked,  undermined,  isolated,  held  to  impossible \nstandards, and unfairly disciplined, and when she complained to EEO, her complaints would go \nback to the people she was seeking EEO assistance to investigate and reign in. \n673.  Plaintiff Carr suffered such severe bullying and hostility at work that it impacted her mental \nhealth and caused extreme stress, anxiety and depression. Plaintiff  Carr was seen by the MPD \nphysician, but denied that she needed extended care because she feared it would be used as an \nexcuse to terminate her employment.  \n674.  Plaintiff Carr’s fears were corroborated when the Director of the DC Fire and Police Clinic, \nMatthew Miranda, shared Plaintiff’s private medical  information  with  Mr. Lee without her \nconsent, which was a violation of Plaintiff Carr’s HIPPA rights, and further chilled her willingness \nto seek assistance for her hostile work-environment-related stress and anxiety.  \n675.  On or about August 19, 2020, the ERT Sgt. Boyd got into a confrontation with Plaintiff  \nCarr during roll call.   \n97 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 98 of 219\n \n676.  He  then  filed  an  EEO  complaint  against  Plaintiff  Carr  for  creating  a  hostile  work \nenvironment for him, even though he outranked her, and she had no power over him.  \n677.  At the time, Sgt. Boyd had already been the subject of several EEO complaints from several \ndifference female officers. \n678.  Sgt. Boyd filed his EEO Complaint against Plaintiff Carr as an act of aggression and \nretaliation. \n679.  Unlike  Plaintiff  Carr’s  EEO  Complaints,  Sgt.  Boyd’s  complaint  was  immediately \ninvestigated, and Plaintiff Carr was threatened with a 30-day suspension.  \n680.  The  EEO  Officer,  Mr.  Harry  Carter  (hereinafter  “Mr.  Carter”)  who  conducted  the \ninvestigation and interviewed the witnesses to the incident, concluded that Sgt. Boyd was the one \nat fault, and dismissed the complaint.  \n681.  Mr. Lee then interceded, demanding that Mr. Carter alter his findings, and eventually fired \nMr. Carter for refusing to issue discipline against Plaintiff Carr, in defiance of Mr. Lee’s unlawful \ndemand that Mr. Carter do so.  \n682.  Although Plaintiff Carr narrowly escaped discipline for her role in the incident, she was \nunable to get any MPD management to take her allegations against Sgt. Boyd seriously, and he \nwas not disciplined for his act of bad faith bullying and retaliation.  \n683.  Because MPD refused to act against male officers who bullied Plaintiff Carr, the retaliatory \nand hostile behavior continued.  \n684.  In February of 2020, Plaintiff Carr went to her CDR Guillermo Riveira (hereinafter “Cdr. \nRivera”), the new commander of SOD, with a recording of a confrontation between herself and \nLt. Margiotta.   \n98 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 99 of 219\n \n685.  However, Cdr. Rivera refused to even listen to the recording, and again dismissed Plaintiff \nCarr’s concerns.  \n686.  Despite the fact that Plaintiff Carr’s recording of the incident proved that Lt. Margiotta lied \nduring an investigation by Internal Affairs, MPD management disciplined Plaintiff and suspended \nher for twenty-five (25) days for having recorded the incident. \n687.  Recording incidents is not unlawful in the District of Columbia, and does not require the \nconsent of the person recorded to be lawful. \n688.  Plaintiff Carr was reduced to having to record the hostile work environment she was \ndealing with because neither MPD EEO, nor any of her chain of command would take her \ncomplaints seriously or believe her.  \n689.  On Plaintiff Carr’s behalf, the Union appealed the suspension and went directly to the Chief \nContee to obtain redress for the unfair discipline. \n690.  Plaintiff Carr also appealed directly to Chief Contee about the racism, sexism, hostile work \nenvironment, and retaliation that she was enduring on the job.   \n691.  In a ruse to get Plaintiff Carr to voluntarily leave the SOD department, in lieu of having to \ninvoluntarily transfer her out, which could and would have been appealed, SOD management \nentered into an agreement with Plaintiff that if she “voluntarily” transferred, they would rescind \nthe disciplinary suspension for the recording. \n692.  Plaintiff  Carr had no desire to transfer into yet another department, but felt that she had no \nreal choice, and did not want a long suspension on her record for an incident in which she was not \nat fault.  \n693.  Plaintiff Carr therefore signed the agreement, and was transferred out of SOD.  \n99 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 100 of 219\n \n694.  MPD then reneged on the agreement and suspended Plaintiff Carr anyway, demonstrating \nhow unfair, biased, and unjust it was willing to be to Black women officers. \n695.  Plaintiff Carr has since returned to work, but lives in constant fear and stress of the \nretaliation, discrimination and unfair treatment she continues to be subject to at the MPD. \n696.  The facts alleged by Plaintiff Carr herein are representative, not exhaustive, of the kind of \ncontinuous,  frequent,  repeated  and  recurring  disparate  and  unfair  treatment,  hostility, \ndisparagement and retaliations she was forced to endure at MPD.  Additional facts in support of \nher claims will be developed in discovery. \n    Plaintiff Carr’s Individual Causes of Action \n  Race Discrimination and Retaliation Claims \n697.  Plaintiff Carr incorporates and restates all of the previous factual allegations contained in \nthis Complaint as if fully restated herein. \n698.  Plaintiff Carr, on her own behalf, asserts herein claims pursuant to Title VII of the Civil \nRights Act of 1964, as amended, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e, et seq.;  the District of Columbia Human \nRights Act, District of Columbia Code § 2-1401.01 et seq., and the Civil Rights Act of 1866 \nDiscrimination Based on Race in the Making and Enforcing of Contracts 42 U.S.C. §1981(a) by \nway of, through and via 42 U.S.C. § 1983. \n699.  Plaintiff  Carr  was  treated  disparately,  subjected  to  a  hostile  work  environment  and \nretaliated against for complaining about and opposing the race discrimination to which she was \nsubjected.  \n700.  The facts alleged above constitute discrimination, and systematic retaliation severe and \npervasive enough to be compensable. \n100 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 101 of 219\n \n701.  The facts alleged above, taken in conjunction with the facts alleged by the other nine (9) \nCRPs, establish that Defendant maintained a pattern and practice of race discrimination against \nBlack women police officers on the basis of race.  \n702.  The facts alleged by Plaintiff Carr that establish that she was treated disparately than her \nnon-Black-female colleagues, are typical of, and consistent with, the claims of the other nine (9) \nCRPs. \n703.  Plaintiff Carr asserts that she was subjected to a hostile work environment because of her \nrace, which deteriorated and became more hostile because of her protected activity, and in \nretaliation for her complaints regarding race discrimination. \n704.  As a direct and proximate cause of the hostile work environment fostered by Defendant, \nPlaintiff Carr was humiliated, embarrassed and made to endure constant stress and anxiety, \ndepression, lack of sleep and other symptoms that caused her severe mental anguish.   \n705.  Plaintiff Carr has incurred lost wages, loss of reputation and loss of career opportunity now \nand into the future, and all the other losses stated herein. \n706.  Plaintiff Carr seeks compensatory damages, and damages for mental pain and suffering, \nabove and beyond recovery as a member of the class, of not less than $300,000.00, plus interest, \ncosts, fees and all other remedies the Court deems appropriate.  \n    Sex Discrimination and Retaliation Claims \n707.  Plaintiff Carr incorporates and restates all of the previous factual allegations contained in \nthis Complaint as if fully restated herein. \n708.  Plaintiff Carr, on her own behalf, asserts herein claims pursuant to Title VII of the Civil \nRights Act of 1964, as amended, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e, et seq., and the District of Columbia Human \nRights Act, District of Columbia Code § 2-1401.01 et seq. \n101 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 102 of 219\n \n709.  Plaintiff  Carr  was  treated  disparately,  subjected  to  a  hostile  work  environment  and \nretaliated against for complaining about and opposing the gender discrimination to which she was \nsubjected.  \n710.  The facts alleged above constitute discrimination, and systematic retaliation severe and \npervasive enough to be compensable. \n711.  The facts alleged above, taken in conjunction with the facts alleged by the other nine (9) \nCRPs, establish that Defendant maintained a pattern and practice of race discrimination against \nBlack women police officers on the basis of sex.  \n712.  The facts alleged by Plaintiff Carr that establish that she was treated disparately than her \nmale colleagues, are typical of, and consistent with, the claims of the other nine (9) CRPs. \n713.  Plaintiff Carr asserts that she was subjected to a hostile work environment because of her \nsex, which deteriorated and became more hostile because of her protected activity, and in \nretaliation for her complaints regarding sex discrimination. \n714.  As a direct and proximate cause of the hostile work environment fostered by Defendant, \nPlaintiff Carr was humiliated, embarrassed and made to endure constant stress and anxiety, \ndepression, lack of sleep and other symptoms that caused her severe mental anguish.   \n715.  Plaintiff Carr has incurred lost wages, loss of reputation and loss of career opportunity now \nand into the future, and all the other losses stated herein. \n716.

Plaintiff Carr incorporates and restates all information and allegations contained in the \npreceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n718.  Pursuant to the District of Columbia Whistleblower Protection Act D.C. Code § 1-615-51 \net seq., Defendants are prohibited from reassigning, terminating or otherwise retaliating against a \nD.C. government employee as a result of that employee’s protected disclosures that the employee \nreasonably believes show gross mismanagement, gross misuse or waste of government resources, \nand abuse of authority in the connection with the administration of a government program, or a \nviolation of a state, local or federal law, rule or regulation.  \n719.  Plaintiff  Carr  engaged  in  protected  disclosures  when  she  reported  race  and  gender \ndiscrimination to the Chief of Police. \n720.  As a direct result of Plaintiff Carr’s protected disclosures, Defendants systematically and \ncontinuously retaliated against Plaintiff Carr, including but not limited to unwarranted disciplinary \nactions against Plaintiff, isolation and separation from coworkers, unfavorable treatment and \nassignments, false and inaccurate performance evaluation and ultimately termination. \n721.  Plaintiff Carr asserts that she was subjected to a hostile work environment because of her \nprotected activity, and in retaliation for her complaints regarding discrimination. \n722.  As a result of Defendants’ actions, Plaintiff Carr suffered significant economic harm in the \nform of loss of employment, corresponding salary, loss of employment opportunities, damage to \nher professional reputation, and significant mental and emotional distress. \n723.  Plaintiff Carr was humiliated, embarrassed and made to endure constant stress and anxiety, \ndepression, lack of sleep and other symptoms that caused her severe mental anguish. \n103 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 104 of 219\n \n724.  Plaintiff Carr has incurred lost wages, loss of reputation and loss of career opportunity now \nand into the future, and all the other losses stated herein. \n725.  Plaintiff Carr herein seeks compensatory damages, and damages for mental pain and \nsuffering of not less than $1,000,000.00 plus interest, costs, fees, and all other remedies the Court \ndeems appropriate. \n      PLAINTIFF CLARK’S INDIVIDUAL CLAIMS \n        Facts Relevant to Plaintiff Clark’s Individual Claims \n726.  Plaintiff Leslie Clark began her employment with the MPD in May of 1989.  She was \ninitially assigned to Seventh District. \n727.  In April of 2001, she was transferred to SOD, and worked there until 2014. \n728.  Plaintiff Clark’s tenure with the MPD was relatively uneventful until on or about \nJuly 11, 2012.  On that date, while sitting at a restaurant having breakfast with her partner Officer \nDarren Edwards, the subject came up about the then First Lady, Michelle Obama’s threat level. \n729.  During the conversation, Officer Christopher Picciano, a white male, told Plaintiff Clark \nthat he wanted to kill First Lady Michelle Obama, and showed Plaintiff Clark a picture of a gun \nthat he indicated he was going to use to do it.  \n730.  Plaintiff Clark had every reason to take the threat seriously, as on occasion, MPD officers \nprovide added security to events in Washington, DC at which the President and First Lady could \nhave been present. \n731.  Plaintiff Clark reported the threat to IAD, as she believed it was her sworn duty to do.  \n732.  It is unclear if IAD investigated the claim, but it leaked to others that Plaintiff Clark had \nreported the threat.  \n104 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 105 of 219\n \n733.  Thereafter, all the white officers and several white MPD officials started treating Plaintiff \nClark in a hostile manner.  No members of MPD senior leadership stepped in to manage the \nsituation. \n734.  Thereafter, Plaintiff Clark was isolated and shunned by her peers, and consistently given \ndangerous and undesirable assignments by her supervisor Sgt. Steve Urps (hereinafter “Sgt. Urps”) \nand (then) Lt. Glover. \n735.  In July of 2012, Officer John Felenchak (hereinafter “Lt. Felenchak”) approached Plaintiff \nClark, and told her that she needed to “mind [her] mother-f****ing business,” (or words to that \neffect). \n736.  Plaintiff Clark was labeled “a snitch,” and MPD leadership, including Sgt. Urps and Lt. \nGlover nurtured and permitted to flourish a work environment in which officers were told to watch \nout for Plaintiff Clark and to ostracize her.  \n737.  Plaintiff Clark went to the MPD EEO office to complain about the way she was being \ntreated.   \n738.  EEO did not take her claims seriously, failed to investigate or intervene in any way, and \nallowed Plaintiff Clark to continue to be subject to a hostile work environment.  \n739.  Plaintiff Clark ultimately chose to retire, on or about May 31, 2014. \n740.  However,  because  of  manning  shortages,  MPD  asked  Plaintiff  Clark  to  return  to \nemployment as an SPO. \n741.  On or about February 6, 2017, Plaintiff Clark returned to MPD in the Special Operations \nDepartment as an SPO. \n105 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 106 of 219\n \n742.  On or about February 18, 2017, Lt. Margiotta informed Plaintiff Clark that she would not \nallow her to work the day schedule, and that he was permanently assigning her to the evening shift.  \nLt. Margiotta gave no explanation or justification for this decision.   \n743.  This schedule presented a hardship for Plaintiff Clark because of her family obligations.  \n744.  On or about February 26, 2017, Plaintiff Clark asked Lt. Margiotta if she could replace \nSPO Chris Coles, who was on day shift, but was being transferred out of the department. Without \nexplanation or justification, Lt. Margiotta refused her request.  \n745.  Approximately three weeks later, Plaintiff Clark requested to work a modified shift, as was \nallowed for Officer Felenchak. \n746.  Lt. Margiotta asked Plaintiff Clark what hours what hours she was actually requesting.  \nWhen she told him 1100-1900, he refused to allow it, insisting that Plaintiff was only going to be \nallowed to work night shifts.  \n747.  Officer Felenchak, a white male, was allowed to change his tour of duty when he wanted \nto, in order to accommodate his home life. \n748.  Other, similarly situated  officers in the department who were not Black women were \nallowed to switch from a night to a day schedule, or vice versa. \n749.  Plaintiff Clark was singled out for disparate and harsher treatment because of her race and \ngender, and because of the racial and gender animus of Lt. Margiotta.   \n750.  On or about March 8, 2017, Plaintiff Clark requested to speak with Capt. Glover about the \nharsh and inflexible schedule she was placed on by Lt. Margiotta. Plaintiff Clark asked if she could \nwork a modified shift to ease the burden on her and her family.  Capt. Glover did not immediately \nrespond to Plaintiff Clark. \n106 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 107 of 219\n \n751.  On or about March 10, 2017, Plaintiff Clark went back to Capt. Glover who informed \nPlaintiff Clark that she was not allowed to work a day schedule, and that he would not let Plaintiff \nClark work a modified shift until some unspecified time when there would be new hires.  \n752.  Plaintiff Clark was later informed by Officer Arnett Perkins that Capt. Glover went into a \nrampage when he found out that Plaintiff was returning to the MPD as an SPO, because he had \npersonal animus against Plaintiff Clark, and was infuriated that he was not consulted prior to her \nreturn.  \n753.  Plaintiff Clark was assigned to the Vice-Presidential escort detail in the Special Events \ndivision of SOD. \n754.  However, Plaintiff Clark was assigned the least secure vehicle in the fleet to do her work.  \n755.  Plaintiff Clark was assigned the “plate reader car,” which used by the SOD Events unit to \nrun the license plates of cars along the routes that would be traveled by the President or Vice \nPresident, to make sure there were no suspicious vehicles on the route.  \n756.  The “plate reader” vehicle was a sedan, without reinforced ballistic-proof doors. All other \nvehicles in the detail were heavy SUV/Truck with ballistic doors.  \n757.  On or about April 26, 2017, Plaintiff Clark asked Lt. Margiotta if she could be assigned a \nvehicle that had ballistic doors because she was working the more dangerous evening schedule.  \n758.  For no apparent reason, Lt. Margiotta denied the request and forced Plaintiff Clark to \ncontinue using the “plate reader” unreinforced sedan vehicle. \n759.  Plaintiff Clark worked the Vice-Presidential detail as her permanent assignment. \n760.  By contrast, Officer Anna DaRoo (hereinafter “Officer DaRoo”) (white female).  Officer \nDaRoo was assigned a new ballistic door SUV/Truck even though she was only on temporarily \nassignment to SOD from the 4th District. \n107 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 108 of 219\n \n761.  Plaintiff Clark, who had the permanent Vice-Presidential escort assignment, was denied \nthe appropriate and safer vehicle because she is Black and female, and because her superior \nharbored animus against her because of her race and gender. \n762.  Unsure what to do about her superior’s racial and gender animus, Plaintiff Clark asked her \nunion representative, Officer Michael Pratt (hereinafter “Officer Pratt”), what to do.  \n763.  Officer Pratt went to speak with Lt. Margiotta about switching Plaintiff Clark to a day \nschedule.   \n764.  Officer Charles Marshall (hereinafter “Officer Marshall”) was in the room when Lt. \nMargiotta and Officer Pratt spoke about Plaintiff Clark’s schedule.  \n765.  During that meeting, Lt. Margiotta asserted that Plaintiff could file whatever paperwork \nshe wanted to file, but that he was never going to change Plaintiff Clark’s work schedule from the \nevening shift.  \n766.  Again, no explanation or justification was given for Lt. Margiotta’s position other than \npersonal racial and gender animus.  \n767.  In September of 2019, Plaintiff Clark asked for a temporary schedule change to help take \ncare of her granddaughter who had suffered second degree burns on her stomach and legs.  \n768.  At the time, Officer Shawn Caldwell (hereinafter “Officer Caldwell)(white male) was \nseeking to switch from the day schedule to an evening schedule.  Thus, there was day shift work \navailable for Plaintiff Clark.  \n769.  Instead of giving Plaintiff Clark the temporary day shift she requested, Lt. Margiotta moved \ntwo white male officers to day schedule, Officer Michael Tucker and Officer David Baker, to \nprohibit Plaintiff Clark from being able to workdays.  \n108 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 109 of 219\n \n770.  Again, there was no basis or justification for this decision other than animus towards \nPlaintiff Clark.  \n771.  Lt. Margiotta routinely allowed officers in the department to trade days off to accommodate \nfamily events.  On or about May 21, 2020, Plaintiff requested to change one of her days off to \nattend her niece’s graduation. \n772.  Lt. Margiotta refused to allow the trade of days off for Plaintiff Clark, and forced her to \nuse a day of leave instead.  This was yet another example of disparate and unfair treatment leveled \nat Plaintiff Clark.  \n773.  A month later during the Black Lives Matter protest, when all days off were cancelled and \nleave was restricted, SPO Christopher Bell (hereinafter “Officer Bell”)(white male) was granted \nleave by Lt. Margiotta for his daughter’s virtual graduation.   \n774.  In July of  2020 while Plaintiff Clark was on limited duty, Sgt. Jane Barrientos told Plaintiff \nClark that Cdr. Rivera put out a memo stating that persons on limited duty had to report to work \nin “courtroom” attire.  \n775.  However, Officer Charles Marshall (black male) and Officer David Baker (white male) \ncame to work in jeans, t-shirts, and tennis shoes.  Essentially, Cdr. Rivera’s “rule” did not apply \nto male officers he favored.  \n776.  In March of 2019, Former SPO Arlinda Page (hereinafter “SPO Page”), in the Traffic Unit, \nrequested of Capt. Glover that Plaintiff be allowed to replace her. The unit’s Lieutenant, Ronald \nWilkins (hereinafter “Lt. Wilkins”) told Plaintiff Clark that he would speak with Capt. Glover \nabout allowing Plaintiff to fill the Traffic Unit vacancy. \n109 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 110 of 219\n \n777.  Lt. Wilkins later told SPO Page that he did not talk to Capt. Glover because he already \nknew that Capt. Glover was going to say no.  Plaintiff Clark thus lost a job opportunity because of \nthe racial and gender animus of Cpt. Glover. \n778.  On or about August 19, 2020, Plaintiff approached Lt. Walter Flemings in the Time and \nAttendance  Department  (hereinafter  “Lt.  Flemings.”)    Plaintiff  Clark  had  worked  in  that \nDepartment for ten (10) years before becoming an SPO, so was very well qualified for the position.  \n779.  On August 25, 2020, Cdr. Rivera denied Plaintiff Clark’s request for the transfer, giving \nLt. Flemings no justification or explanation for the denial.  \n780.  On  or  about  August  29,  2020,  Plaintiff  Clark  met  with  Cdr.  Rivera  and  her  union \nrepresentative, Officer (and Plaintiff herein) Tabatha Knight.  \n781.  At the meeting, Plaintiff Clark asked Cdr. Rivera if she could be detailed to work during \nthe day schedule in order to accommodate her family needs. Cdr. Rivera denied her request \nbecause, according to him, it would generate too many complaints from other (non-Black female) \nofficers.  \n782.  Plaintiff Clark then asked if she could be moved to a different division in SOD.  Cdr. Rivera \nflatly refused to answer her question. \n783.  In May of 2020, Plaintiff Clark learned that Officer Knight was retiring and going to leave \nher position on the Crash Review Board, which was an administrative position.  Officer Knight \nindicated that Plaintiff was well qualified for the position, and Plaintiff asked Cpt. Glover to be \ntransferred to that office.  \n784.  Instead of granting Plaintiff’s request, which would have been best for the MPD, Cpt. \nGlover tried to force Officer Charles Culver (hereinafter “Officer Culver”) to take the job.  Officer \nCulver had no administrative experience and did not want the job. \n110 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 111 of 219\n \n785.  Again, MPD management went out of its way to deny Plaintiff Clark job opportunities, \nand to treat her harshly and with clear animus and hostility, because of her race and gender.  \n786.  Similarly situated officer in SOD, who are not Black females, frequently asked for and \nwere granted job and schedule changes.  Such requests were denied to Plaintiff Clark and other \nBlack women officers.  \n787.  Upon information and belief Cdr. Riveria, Cpt. Glover and Lt. Margiotta harbor racial \nanimus against Plaintiff Clark, and were overheard talking about their specific intent to retaliate \nagainst her have pushed out of the MPD. \n788.  On or about July 24, 2020, Lt. Margiotta wrote Plaintiff Clark up because she came to work \non limited duty on the day shift schedule, and worked the entire week, Monday thru Friday, on \nday shift.  \n789.  Plaintiff Clark broke no rules or policies in doing so, and was free to do so because she \nwas on limited duty. \n790.  Lt. Margiotta wrote Plaintiff Clark up for doing so because for one week, she thwarted his \nconcerted and intentional campaign to harass and attack her, and prohibit her from working her \npreferred schedule.  \n791.  Once she found out she was going to be disciplined for working the day shift, Plaintiff \nClark called IAD to ascertain the status of the investigation into her actions. IAD refused to speak \nto Plaintiff about the status of the discipline.  \n792.  Instead of allowing Plaintiff Clark to work the day shift while she was limited duty, when \nthere was work to be done, Lt. Margiotta forced Plaintiff to evening shift, when there was nothing \nto do.   \n111 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 112 of 219\n \n793.  Plaintiff Clark ended up sitting in the locker room for the duration of her schedule because \nthere was no work for her to complete. \n794.  On several occasions, Plaintiff Clark heard discussion within MPD about management’s \ndispleasure with the number of SPOs who were employed, asserting that they were taking the \npromotional opportunities of younger officers. \n795.  This episode was another example of intentional hostile and abusive treatment of Plaintiff \nClark, to the actual detriment of the MPD, by Lt. Margiotta, for the sole purpose of fostering a \nhostile work environment.  \n796.  Plaintiff Clark’s Union Steward, Officer Rosario, had to ask management three separate \ntimes for the status of the investigation into Plaintiff Clark’s actions, before he was told that Cpt. \nGlover had cancelled the investigation. \n797.  In October 2020, the Department Sergeant, Keith Jackson (hereinafter “Sgt. Jackson”) gave \neveryone in his squad, including Plaintiff, a #4 rating on their performance evaluations, which \nmeant he had to write a memo justifying the #4 ratings.  \n798.  Cdr. Rivera approved everyone in the department getting a #4 rating on their performance \nevaluation, except Plaintiff Clark, who was given a #3 rating, with no explanation as to why she \nwould be singled out for a lower rating.  \n799.  Union Steward Rosario requested that Plaintiff Clark’s rating be changed back to a #4, but \nMPD has refused to do so.  \n800.  Plaintiff Clark asserts that her #3 performance evaluation rating is fraudulent and the result \nof racial and gender animus, and was modified by MPD management in retaliation for Plaintiff’s \nengagement in protected activity. \n112 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 113 of 219\n \n801.  The facts alleged by Plaintiff Clark herein are representative, not exhaustive, of the kind of \ncontinuous,  frequent,  repeated  and  recurring  disparate  and  unfair  treatment,  hostility, \ndisparagement and retaliations she was forced to endure at MPD.  Additional facts in support of \nher claims will be developed in discovery. \n \nPlaintiff Clark’s Individual Causes of Action \n  Race Discrimination and Retaliation Claims \n802.  Plaintiff Clark incorporates and restates all of the previous factual allegations contained \nin this Complaint as if fully restated herein. \n803.  Plaintiff Clark, on her own behalf, asserts herein claims pursuant to Title VII of the Civil \nRights Act of 1964, as amended, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e, et seq.;  the District of Columbia Human \nRights Act, District of Columbia Code § 2-1401.01 et seq., and the Civil Rights Act of 1866 \nDiscrimination Based on Race in the Making and Enforcing of Contracts 42 U.S.C. §1981(a) by \nway of, through and via 42 U.S.C. § 1983. \n804.

The facts alleged by Plaintiff Clark that establish that she was treated disparately than her \nnon-Black-female colleagues, are typical of, and consistent with, the claims of the other nine (9) \nCRPs. \n808.  Plaintiff Clark asserts that she was subjected to a hostile work environment because of \nher race, which deteriorated and became more hostile because of her protected activity, and in \nretaliation for her complaints regarding race discrimination. \n809.

Plaintiff Clark was treated disparately, subjected to a hostile work environment and \nretaliated against for complaining about and opposing the gender discrimination she to which she \nwas subjected.  \n114 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 115 of 219\n \n815.  The facts alleged above constitute discrimination, and systematic retaliation severe and \npervasive enough to be compensable. \n816.  The facts alleged above, taken in conjunction with the facts alleged by the other nine (9) \nCRPs, establish that Defendant maintained a pattern and practice of race discrimination against \nBlack women police officers on the basis of sex.  \n817.  The facts alleged by Plaintiff Clark that establish that she was treated disparately than her \nmale colleagues, are typical of, and consistent with, the claims of the other nine (9) CRPs. \n818.  Plaintiff Clark asserts that she was subjected to a hostile work environment because of \nher sex, which deteriorated and became more hostile because of her protected activity, and in \nretaliation for her complaints regarding sex discrimination. \n819.

Plaintiff Clark seeks compensatory damages, and damages for mental pain and suffering, \nabove and beyond recovery as a member of the class, of not less than $300,000.00, plus interest, \ncosts, fees and all other remedies the Court deems appropriate. \n    Whistleblower Retaliation Claim \n822.  Plaintiff Clark incorporates and restates all information and allegations contained in the \npreceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n823.  Pursuant to the District of Columbia Whistleblower Protection Act D.C. Code § 1-615-51 \net seq., Defendants are prohibited from reassigning, terminating or otherwise retaliating against a \n115 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 116 of 219\n \nD.C. government employee as a result of that employee’s protected disclosures that the employee \nreasonably believes show gross mismanagement, gross misuse or waste of government resources, \nand abuse of authority in the connection with the administration of a government program, or a \nviolation of a state, local or federal law, rule or regulation.  \n824.  Plaintiff Clark was an employee who, as a result of her disclosures to her supervisors, the \nsenior leadership of her department, the EEO Department of the MPD, Assistant Chief Caron, \nChief Newsham, and Chief Contee about the discrimination at MPD, and the complicity of the \nMPD EEO Department in perpetuating it and protecting those who engage in it, ethical violations \nthat included leaking confidential witness statements, the creation of a chilling and retaliatory work \nculture that discouraged officers from complaining about mistreatment and inappropriate police \nconduct, enjoyed the protection of DCWPA.  \n825.  As a direct result of Plaintiff Clark’s protected disclosures, Defendants systematically and \ncontinuously  retaliated  against  Plaintiff  Clark,  including  but  not  limited  to  unwarranted \ndisciplinary actions against Plaintiff Clark, isolation and separation from coworkers, unfavorable \ntreatment  and  assignments,  false  and  inaccurate  performance  evaluation  and  ultimately \ntermination. \n826.

Plaintiff Dickerson joined the MPD in 1988, at the age of 17 as a police cadet. \n840.  During the new hire orientation for her cadet class 88-2, Plaintiff Dickerson was informed \nthat pregnant female cadets could not continue in the program.  In 1989, Plaintiff Dickerson \nbecame pregnant and informed her class sergeant and officer, Sergeant Jenkins and Officer \nWarrick, of that fact.   \n841.  The sergeant and officer told Plaintiff Dickerson that she would not be allowed to remain in \nthe program while pregnant.  Sergeant Jenkins scheduled a meeting between Plaintiff Dickerson and \nLieutenant Johnson.   During this meeting, Lieutenant Johnson informed Plaintiff Dickerson that she \nwould have to have an abortion, or be terminated from the police cadet program.   \n842.  Shortly after that meeting, Plaintiff Dickerson terminated my pregnancy at the Hillcrest \nWomen’s Clinic.  The incident was traumatic and has caused Plaintiff Dickerson severe and \nenduring emotional distress. \n843.  In 1990, while assigned to the Seventh District, Plaintiff Dickerson was offered money, \nclothes, and a car by Lieutenant William Roberts (hereinafter Lt. Roberts) and Detective Roosevelt \nAskew (hereinafter “Det. Askew) in exchange for intimate dates and a willingness to perform \nsexual acts. \n118 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 119 of 219\n \n844.  Plaintiff Dickerson was told by Lt. Roberts and Det. Askew that she needed to agree to \nintimate dates and sex acts with them in order to be promoted and get good assignments.  \n845.  Plaintiff Dickerson did not welcome or accept their advances, but instead asked to be \ntransferred to the Office of Finance and Resource Management.  \n846.  The hostile environment that she was subject to was one of the reasons why Plaintiff \nDickerson resigned from the MPD in 1991.   \n847.  Plaintiff Dickerson returned to the MPD in 1994 as a civilian employee.   \n848.  In 1995, Plaintiff Dickerson started being sexually harassed by Lieutenant Benjamin \nPreston (hereinafter “Lt. Preston”), who made continued, unwanted sexual advances on Plaintiff \nDickerson.   \n849.  Plaintiff Dickerson rejected Lt. Preston’s overtures and eventually complained to Captain \nDewey Wiseman about the unlawful and inappropriate advances from Lt. Preston.  \n850.  Rather than being disciplined, Lt. Preston was allowed to remain in his position of authority \nover Plaintiff Dickerson, and immediately began to retaliate against her for reporting his behavior.  \n851.  Lt. Preston reduced Plaintiff Dickerson’s lunch period from an hour to 30 min, while the \none-hour lunch was kept for all other employees. \n852.  Lt. Preston created a log wherein Plaintiff Dickerson had to sign in and out every time she \nleft the office, including for restroom breaks, when no one else was required to do so.   \n853.  Lt. Preston was also seen on several occasions outside of Plaintiff Dickerson’s home, \nsomewhere he had no legitimate business reason to be, because she lived in Maryland. \n854.  Cpt. Wiseman took no steps to protect Plaintiff Dickerson from harassment or retaliation, \nand failed to take any meaningful action against Plaintiff Dickerson’s harasser. \n119 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 120 of 219\n \n855.  In 1997, while Plaintiff Dickerson was still a probationary patrol officer, Lieutenant Ronnie \nFoye  (hereinafter  “Lt.  Foye”)  made  continued  sexual  advances  and  comments  to  Plaintiff \nDickerson during her training at the Third District.   \n856.  Lt. Foye often commented on Plaintiff Dickerson’s physical attributes and described the \nsexual acts that he wanted to perform on her. \n857.  For example, in one incident that took place in the Fall of 1997, Plaintiff Dickerson’s \ntraining officer, Officer Tonya Longus (hereinafter “Officer Longus”), and Plaintiff Dickerson \nwere on a police call for service on Georgia Avenue NW, when a citizen asked to speak to a \nsupervisor about an open fire hydrant.   \n858.  Officer Longus summoned Lt. Foye.  Upon arrival on the scene, Lt. Foye kept looking and \ncommenting on Plaintiff Dickerson’s buttocks and breasts.   \n859.  The citizen was so appalled by the lieutenant’s behavior, he sent a written complaint to the \nThird District Commander. \n860.  However, no disciplinary action was taken against Lt. Foye, and no attempt was made to \nprotect Plaintiff Dickerson from Lt. Foye’s unlawful advances.  \n861.  On information and belief, prior to Plaintiff Dickerson’s complaint against Lt. Foye, there \nwas another claim against him for sexual harassment that was substantiated, but he was not \nterminated. \n862.  From late 1998-2001, Plaintiff Dickerson was again sexually harassed by Sgt. Jaime \nAnderson (hereinafter “Sgt. Anderson”), who made repeated and continual sexual advances and \ncomments to Plaintiff Dickerson.  \n863.  Sgt. Anderson repeatedly asked Plaintiff Dickerson out on dates, and complimented her on \nher lips, buttocks, and breasts.  \n120 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 121 of 219\n \n864.  Every time Sgt. Anderson prepared roll call, he would assign Plaintiff Dickerson without \na partner so that he could force her to meet with him at different places within the Third District.    \n865.  If another sergeant assigned Plaintiff Dickerson with a male partner, Sgt. Anderson would \nforce the male partner to walk a foot beat, while forcing Plaintiff Dickerson to meet up with the \nSgt. to complete her shift.   \n866.  Plaintiff  Dickerson’s  complaints  about  Sgt.  Anderson’s  abuse  of  power  and  blatant \nharassment were ignored. \n867.  Officer Marjorie Temple also made a sexual harassment complaint against Sgt. Anderson.  \nDuring that investigation, Sgt. Anderson admitted to the investigators that he had sexually harassed \nPlaintiff Dickerson, but no action was taken against him. \n868.  After Sgt. Anderson’s targeted harassment of Plaintiff Dickerson, male officers started \nobjecting to partnering with her because they knew Sgt. Anderson would later change their \nassignment. \n869.  Sgt. Anderson was not fired or disciplined for his blatantly unlawful conduct, and MPD \nleadership failed to address a situation that was so obvious it became a common joke at MPD. \n870.  After Plaintiff Dickerson’s complaint, someone drew a caricature of her on the men’s \nbathroom stall at the Third District with a special emphasis on her buttocks and breasts.  This is \nindicative that the message sent by MPD to its officers was that harassment and disrespect of \nwomen officers was acceptable. \n871.  In 2008, while a sergeant at the Fifth District, after exercising, Plaintiff Dickerson was \ntaking a shower in the female locker room.   \n872.  A male employee from D.C Government’s Department of General Services entered the \nshower area after Plaintiff Dickerson asked him not to.   \n121 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 122 of 219\n \n873.  Plaintiff Dickerson jumped out of the shower, put on minimal clothing, and ran out of the \nshower area into the general area of the police station to solicit help.   \n874.  She hurriedly went to the sergeant’s office, visibly shaken and upset, and told Sergeant \nTerry Thorne (hereinafter “Sgt. Throne”) what had transpired while she was in the shower.   \n875.  The male employee ran out of the shower area and locked himself in a boiler room.  \n876.  Sgt. Thorne urged the employee to exit the boiler room, and to give his account of what \nhad transpired.   \n877.  The employee informed Sergeant Thorne that he heard Plaintiff Dickerson tell him not to \nenter the locker room, and that he had heard the water running in the shower, but decided to enter \nanyway because he ostensibly needed to enter to do his job. \n878.  Plaintiff Dickerson complained to Commander Lamar Greene (hereinafter “Cdr. Greene”) \nwho informed his bosses, Chief Cathy Lanier (hereinafter “Chief Lanier”) and Assistant Chief \nDiane Groomes (hereinafter “Chief Groomes), who initially took no action.  \n879.  After Plaintiff Dickerson’s repeated complaints, an internal  affairs investigation was \ninitiated.   \n880.  MPD detectives arrested the male employee, however the United States Attorney’s Office \ncontacted Plaintiff Dickerson and informed her that the case would not be prosecuted because  \nPlaintiff Dickerson “didn’t have authority to tell him not to enter the ladies’ locker room.”  \n881.  Plaintiff Dickerson continued to complain, and an internal investigation was launched by \nthe male employee against Plaintiff Dickerson.    \n882.  Lieutenant Derrick McNeely (hereinafter “Lt. Neely”), Plaintiff Dickerson’s immediate \nsupervisor, informed her that she was the target of an internal investigation, and directed her to \nwrite a statement explaining her actions.   \n122 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 123 of 219\n \n883.  After  becoming  visibly  upset,  Plaintiff  Dickerson  explained  the  entire  incident.  Lt. \nMcNeely then apologized to Plaintiff Dickerson and told her that he would let her know if the \nstatement would still be needed. \n884.  Lt. McNeely later returned and informed Plaintiff Dickerson that his bosses had instructed \nhim to move forward with the investigation to ensure that she had not violated the department’s \npolicies. \n885.  The MPD initiated an investigation into Plaintiff Dickerson as an act of retaliation and an \nattempt to intimidate her, and to make an example out of her to others, in order to discourage the \nreporting of sexual harassment and misconduct.  \n886.  For  the  duration  of  the  investigation  into  Plaintiff  Dickerson  for  reporting  sexual \nharassment and thereafter, she was denied promotion to Lieutenant, while Chief Lanier promoted \npeople who ranked lower than Plaintiff Dickerson on the exam to \"Acting Lieutenant,\" over \nPlaintiff Dickerson, to make sure Plaintiff Dickerson didn't get promoted.   \n887.  By creating “Acting Lieutenants,” Chief  Lanier filled the Lieutenant  roles, thus  not \nallowing room for Plaintiff Dickerson to be promoted on her merit.  Chief Lanier only made male \nofficers “Acting Lieutenants.  Some of them ranked lower than Plaintiff Dickerson, and some \nhadn’t ranked at all.  \n888.  Chief  Lanier’s  actions  were  retaliatory  in  nature,  and  negatively  affected  Plaintiff \nDickerson’s pay and long-term earning potential.  Furthermore, Chief Lanier circumvented MPD’s \npromotional process. \n889.  In 2012, Plaintiff Dickerson attempted to resolve a situation in which Detective Lieutenant \nPeter Larsen, (hereinafter Det. Lt. Larsen), manager of the Fourth District’s Detectives Unit, sent \nan email to Detective Vandra Covington, in which he used the word “cunt.”   \n123 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 124 of 219\n \n890.  Plaintiff Dickerson requested a meeting with Det. Lt. Larsen’s immediate supervisor, \nCaptain Wilfredo Manlapaz (hereinafter “Cpt. Manlapaz).  Det. Lt. Larsen and Cpt. Manlapaz \nwere present for the meeting.  Neither agreed that the term “cunt” was offensive, or offered an \napology, even after Plaintiff Dickerson expressed to both of them that she was also offended by \nthe email.   \n891.  Cpt. Manlapaz told Plaintiff Dickerson that she should focus on Detective Covington’s \nperformance not a term that she viewed as offensive.   \n892.  Plaintiff Dickerson explained that Det. Covington was not under Plaintiff Dickerson’s \nimmediate supervision, however due to the MPD’s implementation of a new technological case \nmanagement system, that they should develop a training plan for the detective if they had concerns \nabout her performance, but that using foul demeaning language was not acceptable.   \n893.  Lastly,  Plaintiff  Dickerson  explained  that  the  term  “cunt”  must  have  been  used  so \nfrequently by Det. Lt. Larsen that it auto populated on his cellphone.  Plaintiff Dickerson had to \nshow Chief Manlapaz that the MPD email system flagged the term as offensive, when Plaintiff \nDickerson tried to forward Det. Lt. Larsen’s email to a non-government email account.   \n894.  Both Chief Manlapaz and Det. Lt. Larsen continued to deflect, and refused to consider that \nDet. Covington was entitled to greater respect than to be called a “cunt,” regardless of their \nopinions about her performance.  Shortly thereafter, Detective Covington, the victim of Det. Lt. \nLarsen’s sexism and disrespect, was transferred to the Seventh District’s Detectives Unit. \n895.  As a result of this incident, Plaintiff Dickerson was called before Commander George \nKucik (hereinafter “Cdr. Kucik,” and Captain William Fitzgerald (hereinafter “Cpt. Fitzgerald”), \nand told that she should voluntarily transfer out of the department, which Plaintiff Dickerson \ninterpreted as both a threat and blatant act of retaliation.  \n124 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 125 of 219\n \n896.  Plaintiff Dickerson left the meeting dejected but did not request a transfer. Instead, she \ncomplained to Assistant Chief Peter Newsham who was Commander Kucik’s boss at the time of \nthe incident.  No action was taken against any of the males involved and Chief Newsham urged \nPlaintiff Dickerson not to transfer to another division.   \n897.  Plaintiff Dickerson continued to work directly for Det. Lt. Larsen until July of 2014.  After \nthat incident, Det. Lt. Larsen refused to have in-person or telephone conversation with her. He \nonly communicated with Plaintiff Dickerson by email.  \n898.  According to written MPD policy, referring to a woman as a “cunt,” is not acceptable.  \n899.  Det. Larsen was never reprimanded or disciplined for his use of sexist, demeaning and \nderogatory language to a fellow female police Detective, in blatant violation of MPD rules. \n900.  In 2013, Plaintiff Dickerson took the lieutenant’s promotional exam for the third time.  On \nboth previous tests, she was ranked promotable, but was passed over.  On this third attempt, she \nwas again ranked promotable.   \n901.  In July of 2014, she was promoted to Acting Lieutenant and transferred to the Second \nPolice District, and ultimately promoted to Lieutenant in October of 2014.   \n902.  Another detective sergeant, who did not perform as well as she had on the exam, was also \ndesignated as an Acting Lieutenant at the same time. However, he was allowed to remain in the \nCriminal Investigations Division, and was not transferred. \n903.  Transferring departments is often undesirable for officers because it can be strain on an \nofficer, and/or his or her family.  It can involve changing commutes, work hours, vacation \nschedules and duties, and is often very disruptive.   \n125 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 126 of 219\n \n904.  From March 30, 2018, until July 13, 2021, Plaintiff Dickerson was the only sworn female \npolice officer on MPD's executive staff.  She was also the highest-ranking Black woman officer at \nMPD. \n905.  Plaintiff Dickerson was assigned to Patrol Services South Bureau, which experienced the \nhighest level of violent crimes, particularly shootings and homicides.  \n906.  In 2018, 2019 and 2020, and during each year's end-of-year performance evaluation, \nPlaintiff Dickerson asked Chief Peter Newsham to be allowed to attend weekly homicide meetings \nand be included in strategizing sessions to reduce homicides and violent crime city-wide.   \n907.  Each  year,  Chief  Newsham  denied  Plaintiff  Dickerson’s  request,  leaving  Plaintiff \nDickerson out of the loop of critical information to combat crime and to execute her duties.  There \nwas no justification or excuse for excluding Plaintiff Dickerson from these important meetings. \n908.  In February of 2019, during an executive performance briefing, Plaintiff Dickerson noticed \na staggering disparity in serious discipline involving employees of color at MPD.  Plaintiff \nreiterated her concerns about disparities in serious discipline in February of 2020 and March of \n2021. \n909.  When Plaintiff Dickerson mentioned it to Chief Newsham, rather than take Plaintiff \nDickerson’s concerns seriously, Chief Newsham’s staff stopped sending Plaintiff Dickerson \ncalendar  invitations,  minutes  or  other  information  about  attending  disciplinary  committee \nmeetings. It is highly unlikely that the staff would make such a change without Chief Newsham’s \napproval.   \n910.  Thereafter, Chief Newsham frequently refused to answer Plaintiff Dickerson’s emails, text \nmessages, and phone calls.  As her direct supervisor, his refusal to engage with her materially \nhampered Plaintiff Dickerson’s ability to do her job. \n126 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 127 of 219\n \n911.  Chief Newsham’s sabotage and disregard of Plaintiff Dickerson was retaliatory, designed \nto isolate Plaintiff Dickerson and keep her ignorant of information important to fulfilling her \nresponsibilities.  \n912.  On February 14, 2019, Plaintiff Dickerson had an emergency medical procedure that left \nher experiencing pain, headache, brain fog, and dizziness. \n913.  But instead of giving her the necessary time to recuperate, she was forced to return to work \nand give a presentation on or about February 21, 2019, even though she had a follow-up medical \nappointment for that day. \n914.  Plaintiff Dickerson’s colleague, Assistant Chief Lamar Greene had agreed to present \nPlaintiff Dickerson’s information for her, but was not allowed to help her in that way.  Chief \nGreene and Plaintiff Dickerson were both Patrol Bureau Chiefs and had similar issues and \nconcerns.  Both were capable of making the presentation and had done so jointly in the past. \n915.  But Plaintiff Dickerson was subject to disparate and more harsh and taxing treatment than \nher colleague, for no discernibly legitimate reason.  \n916.  The pressure put on Plaintiff Dickerson to present when she was not feeling well was \ngratuitous and meant to send a negative message to her.  \n917.  In March of 2019,  Plaintiff Dickerson notified IAD Chief Manlapaz that she had evidence \nthat Commander Morgan Kane (hereinafter “Cdr. Kane”) was misclassifying or reassigning \nviolent crimes to avoid the appearance of an increase in these crimes in the First Police District.   \n918.  This was a serious allegation of misconduct against a direct subordinate of Plaintiff \nDickerson’s, grounded in evidence. \n919.  In December 2019, Plaintiff Dickerson sent Assistant Chief Manlapaz a follow up email \nasking for an update or the outcome of the investigation.   \n127 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 128 of 219\n \n920.  Despite compelling evidence, Plaintiff Dickerson was informed that the allegations were \nclassified as insufficient facts or unfounded.   \n921.  Plaintiff Dickerson expressed her confusion and displeasure with the outcome given the \nevidence provided to Chiefs Newsham and Manlapaz, but Plaintiff Dickerson never received \nclarification or an explanation for the result.   \n922.  Chiefs Newsham and Manlapaz undermined Plaintiff Dickerson’s authority by using their \npower to cover-up and excuse misconduct in Plaintiff Dickerson’s department.  \n923.  After  that  incident,  executive  management,  including  Chief  Newsham  and \nCommunications Director Dustin Sternbeck  (hereinafter  “Mr. Sternbeck”) began to  exclude \nPlaintiff Dickerson from essential meetings.  Mr. Sternbeck would exclude Plaintiff Dickerson \nfrom press conferences about events that took place in her area of responsibility. \n924.  Chief  Newsham  denied  Plaintiff  Dickerson  important  and  desirable  training  and \ndevelopment opportunities that were given to all of her colleagues.  Plaintiff Dickerson’s picture \nwas even removed from the final version of the annual calendar, even though her picture was in \nthe draft that was disseminated. \n925.  For example, in December 2018 and October 2019, Plaintiff Dickerson asked Chief \nNewsham and his Chief of Staff, Matthew Bromeland, if she could attend the National Counter \nTerrorism Seminar in Israel.   \n926.  This training has been attended by police executives in major city police departments \nacross the country, and is valued because Israel is known for its strategies to combat terrorism and \ncommunity resilience practices.   \n927.  Plaintiff Dickerson was denied the opportunity to attend.  All of Plaintiff Dickerson’s male \ncolleagues who wanted to attend were given the opportunity to go.   \n128 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 129 of 219\n \n928.  In the Fall of 2019, Chief Newsham sent one of Plaintiff Dickerson’s male subordinates, \nCommander Randy Griffin (hereinafter “Cdr. Griffin”) to Israel.   \n929.  Commander Griffin informed Plaintiff Dickerson that during his visit, all other attendees \nwere Deputy/Assistant Chiefs or Chiefs of Police.  \n930.  Cdr. Griffin stressed that the training was phenomenal, and re-emphasized that he was the \nlowest ranking police official in attendance. \n931.  There was no legitimate reason for Plaintiff Dickerson to have been denied the opportunity \nto attend the training in favor of a male subordinate.  The training was not even funded by MPD.  \nChief Newsham’s denial of this important training opportunity to Plaintiff Dickerson was an act \nof  disparate  treatment,  and  was  in  retaliation  for  her  complaints  about  misconduct  and \ndiscrimination within the MPD. \n932.  MPD executive management engaged in a pattern of negative actions and decisions against \nPlaintiff Dickerson in order to intimidate her and discourage her from complaining about and \naddressing both misconduct, and discrimination at the MPD.  \n933.  In July 2019, Plaintiff Dickerson attended a Strategic Crime briefing with Chief Newsham \nand one of her subordinates.   \n934.  During  the  briefing,  her  subordinate,  Captain  John  McDonald  (hereinafter  “Cpt. \nMcDonald”) made a disparaging remark about young black youth, comparing them to rats.  \n935.  Cpt. McDonald also used the term “on the hunt” while describing the Sixth District’s police \nefforts to reduce robberies, in a way that was dehumanizing and disrespectful of the community.  \n936.  Although Chief Newsham told the Cpt. McDonald that he shouldn’t refer the community \nthat way, no formal investigation was initiated, even though Plaintiff Dickerson informed Chief \n129 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 130 of 219\n \nNewsham that she was offended by the remark, and concerned about Cpt. McDonald’s attitude \ntowards the DC Black community.   \n937.  Plaintiff Dickerson followed-up with Chief Newsham’s Chief Operating Officer, Leeann \nTurner, a week after the incident, and requested that Cpt. McDonald be transferred from her bureau \nand a formal investigation initiated into his comments and interactions with the Black community. \n938.  Plaintiff Dickerson’s request was initially denied, and her concerns about Cpt. McDonald \nand his possible racial animus was ignored by Chief Newsham. But because of her persistence, an \ninvestigation was opened and substantiated, and Cpt. McDonald was demoted. \n939.  On or about January 4, 2020, the production company for investigative journalist Soledad \nO’Brien (hereinafter “Soledad Productions”) contacted MPD (Communications Department, PIO) \nto request an interview with Plaintiff Dickerson for an HBO documentary titled “Black and \nMissing.”  \n940.  MPD replied that Plaintiff Dickerson no longer worked in that area but would authorize \nthe current Commander, Ramey Kyle (hereinafter “Cdr. Kyle”) (white male) to handle the \ninterview.   \n941.  There were numerous emails exchanges between the executive producer and the PIO \ndirector.  Soledad Productions agreed to interview Cdr. Kyle, but stressed the importance of \nfeaturing Plaintiff Dickerson’s work as a black woman in the areas of missing persons and human \ntrafficking. \n942.  On or about January 24, 2020, MPD declined to participate in the documentary because of \nthe team’s persistence to interview Plaintiff Dickerson.   \n943.  On or about February 3, 2020, Plaintiff Dickerson met with Chief Newsham to discuss the \ndecision to decline the interview.  \n130 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 131 of 219\n \n944.  He told Plaintiff Dickerson that it would be unfair to Cdr. Kyle if he allowed Plaintiff \nDickerson to participate in the interview, even though Plaintiff Dickerson had a unique perspective \nas a Black woman police officer.  \n945.  Chief Newsham agreed to allow Plaintiff Dickerson to participate after the executive \nproducer threatened to have Soledad O’Brien contact Mayor Bowser directly.   \n946.  During the meeting, Chief Newsham told Plaintiff Dickerson that he didn’t understand why \ndoing this interview was so important to her, and he didn’t expect Plaintiff Dickerson to “make \ntrouble” for him.   \n947.  Of note, Cdr. Kyle was lower ranking than Plaintiff Dickerson, and Plaintiff Dickerson was \nso sharp and knowledgeable about human trafficking, that Chief Newsham had previously allowed \nher to conduct a human trafficking presentation in his stead at the International Assoc. of Chiefs \nof Police.  \n948.  In another example of a petty, retaliatory act, MPD refused to sign a release to allow \nPlaintiff Dickerson to participate in Queen Latifah’s “Gloves Off” segment that featured one of \nPlaintiff Dickerson’s subordinate officers, Tiara Brown.   \n949.  MPD signed releases for other officers to be in the segment that highlighted a Black female \npolice officer (and Plaintiff Dickerson herein), but refused to allow the most senior Black woman \nin the Department to participate.  \n950.  In April 2021, Plaintiff Dickerson noticed during a crime briefing that her subordinate, \nCdr. Kane was, once again, attempting to misclassify crimes.   \n951.  MPD’s new Executive Assistant Chief, Ashan Benedict (hereinafter “EAC Benedict”) was \nin charge of the briefing. Cdr. Kane complained to EAC Benedict because Plaintiff Dickerson, \nCdr. Kane’s direct supervisor, told her to correct the crime report.   \n131 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 132 of 219\n \n952.  On or about April 21, 2021, Plaintiff Dickerson forwarded to EAC Benedict the email from \nInternal Affairs about the history of Cdr. Kane and crime reports.   \n953.  Thereafter, the dialogue between Plaintiff Dickerson and EAC Benedict changed. EAC \nBenedict cancelled a one-on-one meeting with Plaintiff Dickerson and has stopped engaging her \ndirectly on several key issues. \n954.  Since being made Chief, Plaintiff Dickerson has been treated disparately with respect to \nstaffing and resources than her white and male colleagues. \n955.  Plaintiff Dickerson has requested EAC Benedict to authorize a sergeant and administrative \nassistant for her new bureau, but was told that she would have to wait to fill her vacancies.  Those \nvacancies were filled on or about August 16, 2021. \n956.  Plaintiff Dickerson reiterated to EAC Benedict that she only had two employees on her \nteam, and that it was difficult to achieve department goals with minimal staffing.   \n957.  In sharp contrast, despite issues with her reporting accuracy and candor, Cdr. Kane was \npromoted to Assistant Chief of Police on or about July 14, 2021, to oversee a newly created bureau \nfor her, and was immediately given a staff assistant and sergeant. \n958.  In February of 2021, Plaintiff Dickerson raised concerns about Black women officers being \ndisciplined for recording their conversations with their supervisors and EEO.  Plaintiff Dickerson \nwas troubled because it was clear to her that Black women officers felt the need to record \nconversations because they were not being treated fairly.  \n959.  Plaintiff Dickerson also was concerned because the Black women officers were being \ndisciplined for something that was not a clear violation of police rules.   \n960.  Plaintiff Dickerson’s concerns fell on deaf ears and resulted in backlash and retaliation \nagainst her. \n132 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 133 of 219\n \n961.  On or about July 27, 2021, there was an MPD executive retreat at the Wharf DC.  During \nthe retreat, Plaintiff Dickerson asked the group to consider whether MPD had an issue with \nsystemic racism, real or perceived.   \n962.  EAC Benedict replied, in part, that people often “believe” that there is a systemic racism \nissue when it’s actually a “performance” issue.   \n963.  EAC Benedict did not specify in whom the performance deficiency lay, nor did he seem \nparticularly interested in how real or perceived racism affected the people who believed they were \nbeing harmed by such treatment. \n964.  EAC Benedict did not speak or converse with Plaintiff Dickerson during the entire two- \nday retreat, but cordially interacted with Plaintiff Dickerson’s colleagues.  \n965.  As Patrol Chief for three years prior to  her  current  assignment, Plaintiff Dickerson \nfrequently interacted with, and had a good relationship with EAC Benedict, while he was at the \nBureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.  \n966.  She was therefore able to sense the chill in his interaction with her when she started to raise \nconcerns about racism at MPD. \n967.  Chief Newsham often dismissed Plaintiff Dickerson’s presence in rooms filled with her \nsubordinates or community members.   \n968.  Chief Newsham, Commander Andre Wright, and Plaintiff Dickerson were in front of the \ngroup offering congratulatory remarks.  On each occasion, Chief Newsham offered remarks and \ndeferred to Commander Wright after he finished speaking.  Commander Wright immediately \nintroduced Plaintiff Dickerson and allowed her to address the audience before him.  Commander \nWright was following the rank structure that Chief Newsham blatantly ignored.  \n133 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 134 of 219\n \n969.  On or about January 1, 2021, Plaintiff Dickerson was the third in command of the \nMetropolitan Police Department.  On or about January 2, 2021, Mayor Muriel Bowser swore in \nChief Robert J. Contee III as the acting chief of police for the department.   \n970.  Prior  to  his  appointment,  Chief  Contee  was  the  Assistant  Chief  of  Police  of  the \nInvestigative Services Bureau (ISB).  Plaintiff Dickerson has vast knowledge and experience in \nsupervising and managing criminal and administrative investigations.  Chief Contee promoted a \nwhite male subordinate to Assistant Chief to oversee ISB.  Plaintiff Dickerson was not offered, or \neven considered for this position. \n971.  In March of 2021, the second in command, Asst. Chief Greene, announced that he would \nbe retiring from the department in May of 2021.  On April 2, 2021, Chief Contee hired EAC \nBenedict, a retired officer from a completely different administration, to be second in command.  \n972.  Despite Plaintiff Dickerson’s education, knowledge, familiarity with the city and citizens \nof DC, and long tenure on the MPD, she was not offered, or even considered for the EAC position. \n973.  On or about May 7, 2021, Plaintiff Dickerson was reassigned from being a three-star \nAssistant Chief to a two-star Assistant Chief, and was downgraded and demoted from third in \ncommand to eighth in command, below all the male executive sworn officers.   \n974.  Plaintiff Dickerson was assigned to lead the Youth and Family Engagement Bureau.  She \nwent from having an assigned seat and voice in the MPD weekly Monday & Thursday meetings, \nto not being included in any crime fighting strategies.   \n975.  Chief Contee informed Plaintiff Dickerson in July of 2020, (as peers) that she was the \n“conscience of the department,” and he openly wondered what would happen to MPD when \nPlaintiff Dickerson left.  He further complemented Plaintiff Dickerson for having the courage to \nalways say what needs to be said. \n134 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 135 of 219\n \n976.  Plaintiff Dickerson asserts that her functional demotion, lack of training opportunities, lack \nof proper resourcing, marginalization and undermining are the result of her efforts to report police \nmisconduct, and her efforts to oppose racism and sexism in MPD. \n977.  The facts alleged by Plaintiff Dickerson herein are representative, not exhaustive, of the \nkind of continuous, frequent, repeated and recurring disparate and unfair treatment, hostility, \ndisparagement and retaliations she was forced to endure at MPD.  Additional facts in support of \nher claims will be developed in discovery. \nPlaintiff Dickerson’s Individual Causes of Action \n  Race Discrimination and Retaliation Claims \n978.  Plaintiff Dickerson incorporates and restates all of the allegations in the previous \nparagraphs as if fully restated herein. \n979.  Plaintiff Dickerson, on her own behalf, asserts herein claims pursuant to Title VII of the \nCivil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e, et seq.;  the District of Columbia Human \nRights Act, District of Columbia Code § 2-1401.01 et seq., and the Civil Rights Act of 1866 \nDiscrimination Based on Race in the Making and Enforcing of Contracts 42 U.S.C. §1981(a) by \nway of, through and via 42 U.S.C. § 1983. \n980.  Plaintiff Dickerson was treated disparately, subjected to a hostile work environment and \nretaliated against for complaining about and opposing the race discrimination to which she was \nsubjected.  \n981.  The facts alleged above constitute discrimination, and systematic retaliation severe and \npervasive enough to be compensable. \n135 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 136 of 219\n \n982.  The facts alleged above, taken in conjunction with the facts alleged by the other nine (9) \nCRPs, establish that Defendant maintained a pattern and practice of race discrimination against \nBlack women police officers on the basis of race.  \n983.  The facts alleged by Plaintiff Dickerson that establish that she was treated disparately than \nher non-Black-female colleagues, are typical of, and consistent with, the claims of the other nine \n(9) CRPs. \n984.  Plaintiff Dickerson asserts that she was subjected to a hostile work environment because \nof her race, which deteriorated and became more hostile because of her protected activity, and in \nretaliation for her complaints regarding race discrimination. \n985.  As a direct and proximate cause of the hostile work environment fostered by Defendant, \nPlaintiff Dickerson was humiliated, embarrassed and made to endure constant stress and anxiety, \ndepression, lack of sleep and other symptoms that caused her severe mental anguish.   \n986.  Plaintiff  Dickerson  has  incurred  lost  wages,  loss  of  reputation  and  loss  of  career \nopportunity now and into the future, and all the other losses stated herein. \n987.  Plaintiff Dickerson seeks compensatory, and damages for mental pain and suffering, above \nand beyond recovery as a member of the class, of not less than $300,000.00, plus interest, costs, \nfees and all other remedies the Court deems appropriate.  \n    Sex Discrimination and Retaliation Claims \n988.  Plaintiff Dickerson incorporates and restates the allegations contained in the previous \nparagraphs as if fully restated herein. \n989.  Plaintiff Dickerson, on her own behalf, asserts herein claims pursuant to Title VII of the \nCivil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e, et seq., and the District of Columbia \nHuman Rights Act, District of Columbia Code § 2-1401.01 et seq. \n136 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 137 of 219\n \n990.  Plaintiff Dickerson was treated disparately, subjected to a hostile work environment and \nretaliated against for complaining about and opposing the gender discrimination to which she was \nsubjected.  \n991.  The facts alleged above constitute discrimination, and systematic retaliation severe and \npervasive enough to be compensable. \n992.  The facts alleged above, taken in conjunction with the facts alleged by the other nine (9) \nCRPs, establish that Defendant maintained a pattern and practice of race discrimination against \nBlack women police officers on the basis of sex.  \n993.  The facts alleged by Plaintiff Dickerson, that establish that she was treated disparately than \nher male colleagues, are typical of, and consistent with, the claims of the other nine (9) CRPs. \n994.  Plaintiff Dickerson asserts that she was subjected to a hostile work environment because \nof her sex, which deteriorated and became more hostile because of her protected activity, and in \nretaliation for her complaints regarding sex discrimination. \n995.  As a direct and proximate cause of the hostile work environment fostered by Defendant, \nPlaintiff Dickerson was humiliated, embarrassed and made to endure constant stress and anxiety, \ndepression, lack of sleep and other symptoms that caused her severe mental anguish.   \n996.  Plaintiff  Dickerson  has  incurred  lost  wages,  loss  of  reputation  and  loss  of  career \nopportunity now and into the future, and all the other losses stated herein. \n997.  Plaintiff  Dickerson  seeks  compensatory  damages,  and  damages  for  mental  pain  and \nsuffering, above and beyond recovery as a member of the class, of not less than $300,000.00, plus \ninterest, costs, fees and all other remedies the Court deems appropriate. \n \n \n137 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 138 of 219\n \n    Whistleblower Retaliation Claim \n998.  Plaintiff Dickerson incorporates and restates all information and allegations contained in \nthe preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n999.

Plaintiff Grier was first employed by MPD in February  of 1989. She retired in March of \n2015, and was asked to rejoin the department in November of 2017. \n1008.  Her first assignment upon her return to MPD, was in the Police Academy, where her duties \nincluded, preparing civilians, via her knowledge, and skills, and MPD general orders and special \norders, to be strong enforcement officers.   \n1009.  In her department there were two offices spaces, for instructors, one was all male officers \nand the other was all female officers.   \n1010.  A civilian manager named Jessica Bress (hereinafter “Ms. Bress”) (white female), who was \nnot part of Plaintiff Grier’s supervisory chain of command, was allowed to assign Plaintiff Grier \nto the office that only had male officers as an \"experiment\" or \"special project.\"  \n139 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 140 of 219\n \n1011.  The assignment caused Plaintiff Grier to be isolated in a work environment that was male \ndominated and jocular, where inappropriate and disrespectful language towards women was used \nregularly. \n1012.  Moreover, the male officers in the department were managed in a way that allowed them \nto act as if no female officer was present.   \n1013.  For example, one of the male officers, Bray Jones (hereinafter “Officer Jones”), would \nregularly  undress  down  to  his  underwear  in  front  of  Plaintiff  Grier,  which  was  extremely \ninappropriate and done to shock Plaintiff Grier and make her feel uncomfortable.  \n1014.  Officer Jones’ provoking and inappropriate behavior happened often enough that on or \nabout November 2020, the Plaintiff Grier, sought the intervention of the departmental Lieutenant, \nArthur Davis (hereinafter “Lt. Davis”). \n1015.  Plaintiff Grier asked if she could speak privately with Lt. Davis about the fact that Officer \nJones would undress in front of her.  Ultimately, Lt. Davis took no action whatsoever, asserting \nthat what Officer Jones was doing by undressing in front of Plaintiff Grier when he could easily \nhave done so privately, was tolerable and acceptable because Officer Jones “wasn’t trying to be \ndeliberately offensive.”  \n1016.  Plaintiff Grier repeatedly asked Lt. Davis and  to either be transferred out of the office \nspace, or for another female officer to be assigned to the office to change the dynamics. Her \nrequests were repeatedly ignored.  \n1017.  Instead, Plaintiff Grier was forced to continue working in an office that was a bastion of \n\"locker-room talk\" and inappropriate language, and was treated as if she did not exist. \n140 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 141 of 219\n \n1018.  In the early months of 2002, Plaintiff Grier arrested and testified against a fellow police \nOfficer, Jay Effler (hereinafter “Officer Effler”), who was operating his police cruiser while \nintoxicated.  \n1019.  Plaintiff Grier had no choice but to make the arrest because Officer Effler was observed \ndriving erratically by a witness who called 911.   \n1020.  Plaintiff Grier’s fellow officers were so incensed about her “snitching,” that they refused \nto provide her back up on the job.  \n1021.  For example, one night Plaintiff Grier was trailing a stolen vehicle.  Normally, in such \ncases, other officers arrive to assist without having to be called. That night, Plaintiff called several \ntimes for back up, and no officers came.  \n1022.  The dispatcher continued to call for back up units (assistance), at which time, Plaintiff \nGrier’s (then) spouse (Retired Detective Lowell Grier), who was the Youth Division Watch \nCommander for that evening, responded from his office to provide his wife back-up in a dangerous \nsituation.  \n1023.  For  the  duration  of  the  incident,  no  other  officers  arrived  to  provide  back-up,  and \nmanagement did not discipline anyone for this breach of procedure and protocol. There were \nseveral other incidents in which officers failed to provide back-up to Plaintiff, which put her at \nrisk. \n1024.   Plaintiff Grier went to court to testify against Officer Effler, her recruiting class colleague, \nwhich she was legally required to do.  But because it did not sit well with her colleagues, they \nshunned her.  \n141 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 142 of 219\n \n1025.  Officer Effler was ultimately diverted, and the case was resolved without further charges, \nbut this outcome did not ameliorate the retaliation against Plaintiff Grier. She was forced to be \ntransferred to day shift for her own safety and wellbeing.  \n1026.  From that point on, Plaintiff Grier was treated as a pariah, isolated and disrespected by \nmanagement and by fellow officers. The Plaintiff Grier was advised by a fellow officer, to “Watch \nyour Back!” after the incident with the intoxicated officer.  \n1027.  MPD management was aware of what the other officers were doing to Plaintiff Grier, and \nchose to do nothing to change or correct their retaliatory behavior. \n1028.  Plaintiff  Grier  was  discriminated  against  and  treated  more  harshly  than  her  male \ncounterparts and fellow officers in many ways. \n1029.  For example, while at the Police Academy, although all of the officers were supposed to \ntake turns doing details in the field when it was needed, Plaintiff Grier was the only officer to be \nassigned to every detail.   \n1030.  Detail into the field is often viewed as less desirable duty because it requires the officer to \nchange routine, enter into a community with which they might not be familiar, and involves more \nrisk.  \n1031.  Nevertheless, every officer is supposed to assist with special details from time to time, \nbecause it assists them in remaining sharp, and to back up and augment forces when needed.   \n1032.  Plaintiff  Grier  repeatedly  complained  to  her  superiors,  including  to  the  Department \nCommander Ralph Ennis (hereinafter “Cdr. Ennis”)(white male), about the fact that she was being \nsingled out to be assigned to every single detail, but Cdr. Ennis ignored her complaints. Worse, \nCdr. Ennis was actively complicit in the disparate treatment.  \n142 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 143 of 219\n \n1033.  On more than one occasion, especially during the holidays, Cdr. Ennis went to so far as to \nfind a substitute instructor for Plaintiff Grier’s academy class cohort so that he could send Plaintiff \nGrier to the field, rather than sending the substitute person to the field instead. Cdr. Ennis’ \nconfusing choice caused Plaintiff Grier’s class to lose valuable training information. \n1034.   Cdr. Ennis chose to, unnecessarily and counter-productively, send Plaintiff Grier into the \nfield, to make it clear to that her complaints did not matter, and would only bring upon her more \nunfair treatment.  \n1035.  In  2020,  during  the  raging  COVID-19  pandemic,  Plaintiff  Grier  was  again  treated \ndifferently and more harshly than her peers. \n1036.  All of Plaintiff Grier’s colleagues were allowed to work from home and conduct business \nover zoom during the pandemic. Plaintiff Grier, however, was not permitted to do so.   Plaintiff \nGrier’s colleagues worked from home for weeks without incident, while she was still required to \ncome in to work.   \n1037.  As soon as Plaintiff Grier actually tried to work from home, the departmental management \nchanged the work from home policy altogether. This was not mere coincidence.  The Acting Sgt., \nSarah Snapko (hereinafter “Act. Sgt. Snapko”)(white female) stated that by attempting to work \nfrom home as all the other officers were permitted to do, Plaintiff Grier had \"messed it up for \neveryone.\"  Act. Sgt. Snapko was acting under the direction of Ms. Bress and Cdr. Ennis.  \n1038.  Plaintiff Grier was never given an explanation as to why her working from home would be \na problem, when it was fine for all the other officers.  \n1039.  Plaintiff Grier was so dejected from the hostile and discriminatory work environment she \nwas exposed to, she opted to retire, rather than continue working at MPD. \n143 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 144 of 219\n \n1040.  When she retired in March of 2021, she asked to be made a Reserve Official (which is an \nunpaid position) to be able to continue assisting in the Reserve Officer program, because there was \nno female leadership in the Reserve Program.  \n1041.  Plaintiff Grier was aware of the statistical disparities in the ability of women to get through \ntraining successfully, and wanted to continue helping the next generation of female officers. On \nseveral occasions, Plaintiff Grier received feedback that her presence was helpful to female \ntrainees.   \n1042.  Plaintiff Grier was rejected for this volunteer position because several male officers did \nnot want to work with her.   \n1043.  MPD, again, chose to place the sexist and discriminatory preferences, and petty desires for \nrevenge of male officers, over the training needs of female trainees for female leadership and \nsupport in becoming police officers. \n1044.  The facts alleged by Plaintiff Grier herein are representative, not exhaustive, of the kind of \ncontinuous,  frequent,  repeated  and  recurring  disparate  and  unfair  treatment,  hostility, \ndisparagement and retaliations she was forced to endure at MPD.  Additional facts in support of \nher claims will be developed in discovery. \nPlaintiff Grier’s Individual Causes of Action \n  Race Discrimination and Retaliation Claims \n1045.  Plaintiff Grier incorporates and restates all allegations contained in the previous \nparagraphs as if fully restated herein. \n1046.  Plaintiff Grier, on her own behalf, asserts herein claims pursuant to Title VII of the Civil \nRights Act of 1964, as amended, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e, et seq.;  the District of Columbia Human \nRights Act, District of Columbia Code § 2-1401.01 et seq., and the Civil Rights Act of 1866 \n144 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 145 of 219\n \nDiscrimination Based on Race in the Making and Enforcing of Contracts 42 U.S.C. §1981(a) by \nway of, through and via 42 U.S.C. § 1983. \n1047.  Plaintiff  Grier  was treated disparately, subjected to  a hostile work environment  and \nretaliated against for complaining about and opposing the race discrimination to which she was \nsubjected.  \n1048.  The facts alleged above constitute discrimination, and systematic retaliation severe and \npervasive enough to be compensable. \n1049.  The facts alleged above, taken in conjunction with the facts alleged by the other nine (9) \nCRPs, establish that Defendant maintained a pattern and practice of race discrimination against \nBlack women police officers on the basis of race.  \n1050.  The facts alleged by Plaintiff Grier that establish that she was treated disparately than her \nnon-Black-female colleagues, are typical of, and consistent with, the claims of the other nine (9) \nCRPs. \n1051.  Plaintiff Grier asserts that she was subjected to a hostile work environment because of her \nrace, which deteriorated and became more hostile because of her protected activity, and in \nretaliation for her complaints regarding race discrimination. \n1052.  As a direct and proximate cause of the hostile work environment fostered by Defendant, \nPlaintiff Grier was humiliated, embarrassed and made to endure constant stress and anxiety, \ndepression, lack of sleep and other symptoms of severe mental anguish.   \n1053.  Plaintiff Grier has incurred lost wages, loss of reputation and loss of career opportunity \nnow and into the future, and all the other losses stated herein. \n145 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 146 of 219\n \n1054.  Plaintiff Grier seeks compensatory damages, and damages for mental pain and suffering, \nabove and beyond recovery as a member of the class, of not less than $300,000.00, plus interest, \ncosts, fees and all other remedies the Court deems appropriate.  \n    Sex Discrimination and Retaliation Claims \n1055.  Plaintiff  Grier  incorporates  and  restates  all  of  allegations  contained  in  the  previous \nparagraphs as if fully restated herein. \n1056.  Plaintiff Grier, on her own behalf, asserts herein claims pursuant to Title VII of the Civil \nRights Act of 1964, as amended, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e, et seq., and the District of Columbia Human \nRights Act, District of Columbia Code § 2-1401.01 et seq. \n1057.  Plaintiff  Grier  was treated disparately, subjected to  a hostile work environment  and \nretaliated against for complaining about and opposing the gender discrimination to which she was \nsubjected.  \n1058.  The facts alleged above, if proven, constitute discrimination, and systematic retaliation \nsevere and pervasive enough to be compensable. \n1059.  The facts alleged above, taken in conjunction with the facts alleged by the other nine (9) \nCRPs, establish that Defendant maintained a pattern and practice of race discrimination against \nBlack women police officers on the basis of sex.  \n1060.  The facts alleged by Plaintiff Grier, that establish that she was treated disparately than her \nmale colleagues, are typical of, and consistent with, the claims of the other nine (9) CRPs. \n1061.  Plaintiff Grier asserts that she was subjected to a hostile work environment because of her \nsex, which deteriorated and became more hostile because of her protected activity, and in \nretaliation for her complaints regarding sex discrimination. \n146 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 147 of 219\n \n1062.  As a direct and proximate cause of the hostile work environment fostered by Defendant, \nPlaintiff Grier was humiliated, embarrassed and made to endure constant stress and anxiety, \ndepression, lack of sleep and other symptoms that caused her severe mental anguish.   \n1063.  Plaintiff Grier has incurred lost wages, loss of reputation and loss of career opportunity \nnow and into the future, and all the other losses stated herein. \n1064.  Plaintiff Grier seeks compensatory damages, and damages for mental pain and suffering, \nabove and beyond recovery as a member of the class, of not less than $250,000.00, plus interest, \ncosts, fees, and all other remedies the Court deems appropriate. \n    Whistleblower Retaliation Claim \n1065.  Plaintiff Grier incorporates and restates all information and allegations contained in the \npreceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n1066.  Pursuant to the District of Columbia Whistleblower Protection Act D.C. Code § 1-615-51 \net seq., defendants are prohibited from reassigning, terminating or otherwise retaliating against a \nD.C. government employee as a result of that employee’s protected disclosures that the employee \nreasonably believes show gross mismanagement, gross misuse or waste of government resources, \nand abuse of authority in the connection with the administration of a government program, or a \nviolation of a state, local or federal law, rule or regulation.  \n1067.  Plaintiff Grier was an employee who, as a result of her disclosures to her supervisors, the \nsenior leadership of her department, the EEO Department of the MPD, Assistant Chief Caron, \nChief Newsham, the District of Columbia City Council, the Office of the Mayor and the EEOC \nabout the systemic discrimination in the MPD, and the complicity of the MPD EEO Department \nin perpetuating it and protecting those who engage in it, ethical violations that included leaking \nconfidential  witness  statements,  the  creation  of  a  chilling  and  retaliatory  work  culture  that \n147 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 148 of 219\n \ndiscouraged officers from complaining about mistreatment and inappropriate police conduct, \nenjoyed the protection of DCWPA.  \n1068.  As a direct result of Plaintiff Grier protected disclosures, Defendant systematically and \ncontinuously retaliated against Plaintiff, including but not limited to unwarranted disciplinary \nactions against Plaintiff, isolation and separation from coworkers, unfavorable treatment and \nassignments, false and inaccurate performance evaluation and the creation of a hostile work \nenvironment. \n1069.  Plaintiff Grier asserts that she was subjected to a hostile work environment because of her \nprotected activity, and in retaliation for her complaints regarding discrimination. \n1070.  As a result of Defendant’s actions, Plaintiff Grier suffered significant economic harm in \nthe form of loss salary, loss of employment opportunities, damage to her professional reputation, \nand significant mental and emotional distress. \n1071.  Plaintiff Grier was humiliated, embarrassed and made to  endure constant stress and \nanxiety, depression, lack of sleep and other symptoms that caused her severe mental anguish. \n1072.  Plaintiff Grier has incurred lost wages, loss of reputation and loss of career opportunity \nnow and into the future, and all the other losses stated herein. \n1073.  Plaintiff Grier herein seeks compensatory damages, and damages for mental pain and \nsuffering of not less than $1,000,000.00, plus interest, costs, fees and all other remedies the Court \ndeems appropriate. \n \n \n \n148 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 149 of 219\n \n      PLAINTIFF HAMPTON’S INDIVDUAL CLAIMS \n Facts Relevant to Plaintiff Hampton’s Individual Claims \n1074.  Plaintiff Hampton first join the MPD in December of 2003.  Her first duty assignment was \nas a patrol officer in the 7th District.  She remained in that role and in that district for seventeen \n(17) years. \n1075.  Plaintiff Hampton was often detailed to Community Outreach because she was passionate \nabout helping the community that she grew up in, and helping to bridge the gap between the \ncommunity and MPD. \n1076.  On Plaintiff Hampton’s third day at the 7th District, she was sexually harassed by Sergeant \nAndre Suber (hereinafter “Sgt. Suber”), who was one of her immediate supervisors. \n1077.  Sgt. Suber wanted to take Plaintiff Hampton out on a date, and since she was so new on \nthe job she told him she was engaged rather than just rebuffing his advances. Plaintiff Hampton \nwas concerned about angering him.   \n1078.  Sgt. Suber indicated that he did not care if Plaintiff Hampton was engaged, he wanted to \ndate her anyway.  He further told Plaintiff Hampton that he could make her life miserable. \n1079.  Despite the fact that she was new to the force, Plaintiff Hampton reported the sexual \nharassment to her training officer, Anthony Ruchak (hereinafter “Officer Ruchak”), who was \noffended on her behalf and took Plaintiff Hampton immediately to the Union Steward, Officer \nChristopher Bauman (hereinafter “Union Steward Bauman”).  \n1080.  Union Steward Bauman filed an internal EEO complaint on Plaintiff Hampton’s behalf, \nbut the EEO Office decided that there was insufficient evidence and said the claim was unfounded. \n1081.  Union Steward Bauman also filed a complaint with DC OHR.  That claim was also \ninvestigated, and went to mediation.  \n149 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 150 of 219\n \n1082.  At the mediation, it was resolved that Sgt. Suber would no longer be able to supervise \nPlaintiff Hampton for the remainder of her MPD career, but Sgt. Suber was not disciplined in any \nother way. \n1083.  Plaintiff Hampton eventually processed what happened, and was able to carry on with her \ncareer. \n1084.  In October of 2007, Plaintiff Hampton started to be harassed by some young men in the \ncommunity, in front of her home.  \n1085.  They singled her out for intimidation and attacked because she was a police officer living \nin the community, and because she was female. \n1086.  Plaintiff Hampton went to her MPD chain of command to seek assistance and help with \nthe situation, but did not receive the kind of concern or response she expected. \n1087.  At one point, an MPD Detective Mary Bonaccorsy (hereinafter “Det. Bonaccorsy”) went \nto Plaintiff Hampton’s house to conduct a threat assessment. \n1088.  Det. Bonaccorsy concluded that the harassment was Plaintiff Hampton’s fault because she \nshould not have lived in such a dangerous community.  \n1089.  Unfortunately, the harassment escalated, and eventually Plaintiff Hampton went to the \nlocal news to get community support in ending the harassment. \n1090.  MPD leaders were unhappy with Plaintiff Hampton for taking the situation public, and \nrather than providing back-up or support, MPD attempted to silence her and insisted that she cease \ngoing on the news. \n1091.  A few MPD officers came to Plaintiff Hampton’s home to give her back-up against the \nharassment, but they ultimately were disciplined for doing so.  \n150 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 151 of 219\n \n1092.  Plaintiff Hampton felt as if MPD management was doing all it could to prevent her from \ngetting assistance with a dangerous situation, and did not have her back.  \n1093.  At work, the retaliation  against Plaintiff Hampton  escalated.  Her work was hyper-\nscrutinized. She was isolated and lost the camaraderie of her peers.  And word was put out that she \nwas on management’s target list. \n1094.  Plaintiff  Hampton  filed  a  DOJ  complaint  against  Asst.  Chief  Dianne  Grooms  for \nretaliation. \n1095.  DOJ kicked the investigation back to MPD, to be handled by Chief Lanier.  Chief Lanier \nhanded the investigation to IAD, which in turn concluded that the claim was not substantiated. \n1096.  It is worth noting that virtually every officer at MPD knew that Plaintiff was disfavored by \nmanagement, but somehow IAD could find no evidence to substantiate the claim. \n1097.  In January of 2011, Plaintiff was called to a domestic abuse situation in which the man was \nbeating his partner, and Plaintiff ended up having to shoot the man. \n1098.  The girlfriend who was being abused was called by MPD IAD at the shooting review board, \nand IAD attempted to make the case that Plaintiff Hampton was in the wrong. \n1099.  However, the Union attorney, Pressler & Associates, made a request for records to the \nprosecutor’s office, and received two witness statements that corroborated that Plaintiff was \njustified in the shooting. \n1100.  Additionally, Plaintiff Hampton and her partner Kimberly Sillah (hereinafter “Officer \nSillah”) had thirteen (13) veteran officers testify on their behalf. Even the man who was shot by \nPlaintiff Hampton and Officer Sillah, apologized to them. In the end, IAD was chastised by the \ntribunal for its shoddy investigation.  \n151 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 152 of 219\n \n1101.  Both officers involved in the incident were cleared by a unanimous decision of the tribunal, \nand both received an apology from the tribunal for having been put through such an ordeal.  \n1102.  Plaintiff Hampton never received an explanation as to why IAD had not bothered to obtain \nthe critical witness statements.  \n1103.  In  2018, Plaintiff lost her father unexpectedly.  The loss was devastating to Plaintiff and \nher family.  In a moment of extreme grief, she broke down while at work.   \n1104.  Sgt. Delroy Burton (hereinafter “Sgt. Burton”), was considered a friend by Plaintiff \nHampton, and was there when she became emotional.  He hugged her, but then used the moment \nto try to kiss her, which Plaintiff Hampton rebuffed.  She was both confused and hurt by his \nattempted sexual advance. \n1105.  Plaintiff Hampton was too scared to report Sgt. Burton because he was a top leader in the \nUnion, and powerful throughout the MPD. Nevertheless, he retaliated against her. \n1106.  Although Sgt. Burton did not have the authority to discipline Plaintiff Hampton, he did \nhave the reach and power to sully her name, and turn people against her, which he did. \n1107.  In April of 2019, Plaintiff was asked and approved to participated in a recruiting event for \nMPD by Commander Andre Wright (hereinafter “Cdr. Wright”). \n1108.  However,  Lieutenant  Peter  Larsen  (hereinafter  “Lt.  Larsen”),  who  was  the  Watch \nCommander, insisted that Plaintiff Hampton prove that she was authorized to participate in the \nevent.  \n1109.  Plaintiff Hampton had to forward the email from Cdr. Wright approving her participation \nto Lt. Larsen, and even that did not satisfy him.  He demanded that the Recruiting Sergeant verbally \nconfirm to him that Plaintiff Hampton had proper authority to be at the event.  \n152 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 153 of 219\n \n1110.  Lt. Larsen had no reason or justification for making Plaintiff Hampton jump through those \nhoops.  \n1111.  Plaintiff Hampton had to call Cdr. Wright, who then sent out another email, essentially \nclarifying that he said what he said. \n1112.  In June of 2019, Plaintiff Hampton was on patrol and flagged down by a resident, and \nsimultaneously received a call on the radio to serve a protection order. \n1113.  Because  Plaintiff  Hampton  was  detained  speaking  with  the  resident,  she  didn’t \nimmediately answer the radio call. At which point Captain James Boteler (hereinafter “Cpt. \nBoteler”) demanded that Plaintiff Hampton call him, and berated her for not responding to the \nradio fast enough. \n1114.  Cpt. Boteler then sent Sergeant Jonathan Podorski (hereinafter “Sgt. Podorski”) to meet \nPlaintiff Hampton in the field and monitor her to ensure she was responding to the radio. \n1115.  When asked, Sgt. Podorski confirmed that Plaintiff Hampton was the only officer Cpt. \nBoteler treated in such a condescending and micromanaging fashion.  \n1116.  In June of 2019, Plaintiff Hampton discovered that she had been involuntarily detailed to \nthe Teletype Unit, and that her days off would be changed to Monday and Tuesday, which was \nhighly irregular. \n1117.  The Teletype Unit Supervisor informed Plaintiff Hampton that the change in her days off \nwas specifically directed by Cpt. Boetler, which revealed his punitive intent. \n1118.  Plaintiff Hampton felt as if she had no choice but to file an internal EEO complaint \nagainst Cpt. Boteler for targeting her for mistreatment and retaliation. \n1119.  Plaintiff met with EEO Counselor Doreen Haines, who initiated an investigation, but \nPlaintiff Hampton’s claim was unsubstantiated, and no further action was taken. \n153 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 154 of 219\n \n1120.  In May of 2021, Plaintiff Hampton was promoted to Sergeant. \n1121.  In August of 2021, Lieutenant Michael Daee (hereinafter “Lt. Daee”) intentionally \nundermined Plaintiff Hampton’s authority when he intervened to protect a white male officer \nwho had been blatantly disrespectful and insubordinate to Plaintiff Hampton. The officer defied \nher order over the radio, where all officers could hear the exchange. \n1122.  When Plaintiff Hampton attempted to write up the insubordination, Lt. Daee undermined \nher, and made it all but impossible for Plaintiff Hampton to properly do her job. \n1123.  Lt. Daee did not engage in that kind of heavy-handed intervention with respect to other \nSergeants. \n1124.  Lt. Daee further undermined Plaintiff Hampton, by usurping a key authority from her, \nand making her obtain his approval before exercising her discretion.  Again, this was disparate \ntreatment based on Plaintiff Hampton’s race and gender. \n1125.  On or about September 8, 2021, Lt. Daee targeted Plaintiff Hampton for an investigation \nof a shooting that took place on the shift after her shift was completed, rather than investigating \nthe Sergeant who was on duty when the shooting occurred. \n1126.  Lt. Daee didn’t just unfairly target Plaintiff Hampton, but also went out of his way to \ninvolve his peers and other managers in targeting Plaintiff Hampton. \n1127.  Lt. Daee insisted that Plaintiff Hampton attend a recertification training for the Civil \nDisturbance Unit, even though Plaintiff Hampton had never received the certificate in the first \nplace, and did not have underlying knowledge or equipment for the recertification training to be \nof any value. \n1128.  Despite her expressed reservations, Lt. Daee insisted that she go to a training she was not \nprepared for as a form of harassment.  The training, in fact, proved to be fruitless. \n154 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 155 of 219\n \n1129.  On or about September 14, 2021, Plaintiff Hampton went to the scene of a shooting, but \ndue to a lack of available cruisers, had to get a ride with a fellow Sergeant.   \n1130.  The scene was volatile, and Plaintiff Hampton had to work to keep the crowd under \ncontrol. \n1131.  While she was doing that, the officer who had given her a ride, Sergeant Dale Vernick \n(hereinafter “Sgt. Vernick”) (white male), got back in the cruiser and left her on the scene. \n1132.  Plaintiff Hampton had left her personal belongings in the cruiser, and attempted to call \nSgt. Vernick over the radio three times to get him to return.  He refused to respond to her. \n1133.  Another sergeant (Black male) raised Sgt. Vernick on his cell phone, and Sgt. Vernick \nanswered right away, proving that he was intentionally ignoring Plaintiff Hampton. \n1134.  Sgt. Vernick returned to the station so Plaintiff Hampton could get her things.  When he \ngot there, he refused to speak to her or acknowledge that he left her at the scene of a crime. \n1135.  This was the first time in Plaintiff’ Hampton’s career that she was left behind by someone \nshe was riding with, and such is wildly out of norm and MPD standards. It is widely considered a \nserious breach of trust and unacceptable behavior between officers.  \n1136.  MPD management took no disciplinary action whatsoever against Sgt. Vernick. The \nLieutenant in charge at the time, Lieutenant Jonathan Fleming (hereinafter Lt. Fleming), made \nexcuses for Sgt. Vernick’s behavior, and took no action to address the risky situation in which he \nleft Plaintiff Hampton. \n1137.  This act of contempt and disrespect was noticed by all the officers that were on the scene \nand listening to the radio.   \n1138.  The facts alleged by Plaintiff Hampton herein are representative, not exhaustive, of the \nkind of continuous, frequent, repeated and recurring disparate and unfair treatment, hostility, \n155 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 156 of 219\n \ndisparagement and retaliations she was forced to endure at MPD.  Additional facts in support of \nher claims will be developed in discovery. \n              Plaintiff Hampton’s Individual Causes of action \n       Race Discrimination and Retaliation Claims \n1139.

Plaintiff Hampton incorporates and restates all information and allegations contained in \nthe preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n1160.  Pursuant to the District of Columbia Whistleblower Protection Act D.C. Code § 1-615-51 \net seq., defendants are prohibited from reassigning, terminating or otherwise retaliating against a \nD.C. government employee as a result of that employee’s protected disclosures that the employee \nreasonably believes show gross mismanagement, gross misuse or waste of government resources, \n158 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 159 of 219\n \nand abuse of authority in the connection with the administration of a government program, or a \nviolation of a state, local or federal law, rule or regulation.  \n1161.  Plaintiff Hampton was an employee who, as a result of her disclosures to her supervisors, \nthe senior leadership of her department, the EEO Department of the MPD, Assistant Chief Caron, \nChief Newsham, the District of Columbia City Council, the Office of the Mayor and the EEOC \nabout the systemic discrimination in the MPD, and the complicity of the MPD EEO Department \nin perpetuating it and protecting those who engage in it, ethical violations that included leaking \nconfidential  witness  statements,  the  creation  of  a  chilling  and  retaliatory  work  culture  that \ndiscouraged officers from complaining about mistreatment and inappropriate police conduct, \nenjoyed the protection of DCWPA.  \n1162.  Plaintiff Hampton asserts that she was subjected to a hostile work environment because of \nher protected activity, and in retaliation for her complaints regarding discrimination. \n1163.  As a direct result of Plaintiff Hampton protected disclosures, Defendant systematically and \ncontinuously retaliated against Plaintiff, including but not limited to unwarranted disciplinary \nactions against Plaintiff, isolation and separation from coworkers, unfavorable treatment and \nassignments, false and inaccurate performance evaluation and ultimately termination. \n1164.  As a result of Defendants’ actions, Plaintiff Hampton suffered significant economic harm \nin  the  form  of  lost  employment  opportunities,  damage  to  her  professional  reputation,  and \nsignificant mental and emotional distress. \n1165.  Plaintiff Hampton was humiliated, embarrassed and made to endure constant stress and \nanxiety, depression, lack of sleep and other symptoms that caused her severe mental anguish. \n159 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 160 of 219\n \n1166.  Plaintiff Hampton herein seeks compensatory damages, and damages for mental pain and \nsuffering of not less than $1,000,000.00, plus interest, costs, fees, and all other remedies the Court \ndeems appropriate. \n          PLAINTIFF KNIGHT’S INDIVIDUAL CLAIMS \n      Facts Relevant to Plaintiff Knight’s Individual Claims \n1167.  Plaintiff Knight began her employment with the MPD in 1989, when she was hired for a \ncivilian position.  In 1991, she transferred to a sworn officer position and was assigned to the 4th \nDistrict.  \n1168.  While Plaintiff Knight was still a rookie and in training, Sgt. Braum Persaud (hereinafter \n“Sgt. Persaud”) began sexually harassing her by making inappropriate and suggestive comments. \n1169.  Plaintiff Knight complained of Sgt. Persaud’s inappropriate, intimidating and unwanted \nadvances to her supervisor, but nothing was done. \n1170.  Eventually, Sgt. Persaud went so far to call Plaintiff Knight’s grandmother’s house on \nPlaintiff’s day off. When Plaintiff Knight returned the call, which was very unusual, Sgt. Persaud \nasked her to meet him for a sexual assignation. When Plaintiff Knight refused, and explained that \nshe was married, Sgt. Persaud’s demeanor towards Plaintiff completely changed.  \n1171.  Sgt. Persaud retaliated against Plaintiff Knight for refusing his advances by giving her very \nundesirable assignments, such as a walking beat that was only one block long, and forbade other \nofficers from helping or relieving Plaintiff Knight, making it clear to Plaintiff Knight, and to \neveryone else on the team that she was his target, and that no one was to help her.  \n1172.  At times, Sgt. Persaud’s retaliation and mistreatment of Plaintiff Knight left her with no \nback-up or assistance in parts of the city with active gang violence, which put her personal safety \nat risk. \n160 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 161 of 219\n \n1173.  In 1993, Plaintiff Knight again informed her superior Commander Bill Sarvis (hereinafter \n“Cdr. Sarvis”) that she was being sexually harassed and retaliated against by Sgt. Persaud. Instead \nof investigating or disciplining Sgt. Persaud, Defendant made Plaintiff Knight switch Districts \nwith another female officer, Carolyn Battle, and moved Plaintiff Knight to the First District. \n1174.  On Plaintiff Knight’s first day in her new district, Captain Michael Razalowski (hereinafter \n“Capt. Razalowski”), the leader of the First District substation called Plaintiff Knight into his \noffice and proceeded to scream and curse at her, calling her a “trouble-maker.” \n1175.  From that day on, the First District Station Sergeants, Phillip Parker (hereinafter “Sgt. \nParker”) and Richard Gets  (hereinafter “Sgt.  Gets”), harassed,  attacked, bullied, demeaned, \nisolated and undermined Plaintiff Knight on a near-daily basis. \n1176.  The systematic, and management-approved retaliation against Plaintiff Knight continued \nunabated until Cpt. Razalowski was replaced by Captain Charles Fonville (hereinafter “Cpt. \nFonville”).   Cpt. Fonville put a stop to the harassment and retaliation, but he did not discipline the \nSgts  who had engaged in it. \n1177.  Plaintiff Knight received a phone call from Cpt. Fonville informing her that Sgt. Persaud \nmade Lieutenant and was transferred to the First District sub-station, over Plaintiff Knight.  Cpt. \nFonville told Plaintiff Knight not to worry, that if anything inappropriate happened, she should \nimmediately him.  But a few months later, Cpt. Fonville was promoted and transferred, and the \nbullying continued.  \n1178.  In 1997 Plaintiff Knight became pregnant with twins.  Lt. Persaud told her that she wasn’t \nallowed to sit in the station “looking like that” and made her sit in the break room, which was \nhumiliating to her.  \n161 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 162 of 219\n \n1179.  Per MPD policy at the time, Plaintiff Knight was required to make routine visits to the \nPolice and Fire Clinic because she was on limited duty.  There was a steep hill between the parking \nlot and the clinic.  Plaintiff Knight asked Lt. Persaud if she could get a ride to the clinic to avoid \nwalking up the steep hill, but he refused her request, while he granted rides to other non-Black \nwomen who went to the clinic. \n1180.  The combination of the stress of being bullied at work, and the strain of repeatedly walking \nup the steep hill while carrying twins proved to be very detrimental to Plaintiff Knight’s pregnancy.  \nShe went into premature labor, and lost both of the twins.  \n1181.  Plaintiff Knight remained in the Fist District until 1997, when she was swapped out with \nanother officer from the Fifth District. \n1182.  In 2001, Plaintiff Knight was again transferred, this time to the training academy as an \ninstructor.  Her direct supervisors were Mr. Larry Edwards (hereinafter “Mr. Edwards”) and \nSergeant Darryl Price (hereinafter “Sgt. Price”).   \n1183.  Mr. Edwards rarely spoke to the Black officers in his sections.  He would wait until the \nofficer walked away from their workstation and would communicate through sticky notes that he \nplaced on their computers.  \n1184.  Mr. Edwards had no problem communicating with the white officers face-to-face.  Mr. \nEdwards would often send the white officers to trainings and conferences, while not informing \nSgt. Price or the black officers.  The black officers raised the issue with Sgt. Price, and he spoke \nto Mr. Edwards about it, but the disparate treatment was not escalated, and no disciplinary action \nwas taken. \n162 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 163 of 219\n \n1185.  Sgt. Price was transferred to the Assistant Chief’s Office, and shortly thereafter, the three \nBlack  officers  who  worked  under  Mr.  Edwards  were  involuntarily  transferred  to  different \nassignments within the academy. \n1186.  Plaintiff  Knight  was  assigned  to  work  under  Mr.  Byron  Williams  (hereinafter  “Mr. \nWilliams”) and Sergeant Kimberly Butler (hereinafter “Sgt. Butler.”)  During a staff meeting, Sgt. \nButler informed Plaintiff Knight that there was a rumor that she was having an affair with Mr. \nWilliams.  Plaintiff Knight became very upset, strenuously denying the rumor.  \n1187.  Nevertheless, the false rumor persisted, and when Plaintiff Knight attempted to report Mr. \nWilliams for grabbing her butt, which he did while smiling at her, her complaint was not taken \nseriously because the Commander she reported the sexual assault to, assumed the rumor was true.  \n1188.  Although the Commander claimed she would “look into it,” no action was taken, and \nPlaintiff never heard another thing about it.  Mr. Williams was eventually terminated. \n1189.  In 2009, Plaintiff Knight was transferred to the District 5 administrative office with \nSergeant Randy Griffin (hereinafter “Sgt. Griffin”).  \n1190.  Sgt. Griffin was not happy with Plaintiff Knight being assigned under him because he felt \na male officer whom Sgt. Griffin preferred, was moved out of admin to make room for Plaintiff \nKnight.  \n1191.  Sgt. Griffin was thus hostile and unprofessional and retaliatory towards Plaintiff Knight \nfrom the beginning of her assignment.  \n1192.  Sgt. Griffin wrote-up Plaintiff Knight for three separate disciplinary infractions, and rather \nthan provide them to her in a professional manner, he placed them in her jacket.   \n1193.  When Plaintiff Knight discovered them, she went directly to the department Captain to \naddress the situation.  \n163 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 164 of 219\n \n1194.  The department Captain, Lewis Douglas, removed the disciplinary actions, but no action \nor discipline was taken against Sgt. Griffin for abuse of his power and fraudulent disciplinary \nactions.  \n1195.  To further retaliate against and bully Plaintiff Knight, Sgt. Griffin ordered Plaintiff Knight \nto report to the Police and Fire Clinic for a fitness for duty evaluation, which can be a first step \ntowards termination. Sgt. Griffin claimed that the basis for the referral was that Plaintiff Knight \nhad informed him that she was “depressed,”  which was completely false.  \n1196.  Plaintiff Knight complained to the department commander that what Sgt. Griffin had done \nwas wrong and retaliatory, and she was informed by Capt. Douglas to disregard the improper \nreferral.  \n1197.  Plaintiff Knight was moved from the part of the office where she worked for Sgt. Griffin \nand placed under the department commander. Sgt Griffin was removed from the administrative \noffice. Shortly thereafter Plaintiff Knight was transferred to SOD. \n1198.  Plaintiff Knight served in SOD from 2009 to March of 2014.  In March of 2014, Plaintiff \nKnight was summarily sent back to the Fifth District from SOD without explanation. Plaintiff was \nconfused by the transfer because there didn’t appear to be a reason for it.  \n1199.  Plaintiff Knight contacted Chief Lamar Green (hereinafter “Chief Green”), to find out why \nshe had been transferred.  He investigated and informed Plaintiff that the order came from Chief \nCathy Lanier (hereinafter “Chief Lanier”) who was incensed about some incident that purportedly \ninvolved Plaintiff Knight. In short, Plaintiff Knight was punitively transferred before she was even \ninformed or asked about the incident. \n1200.  Plaintiff Knight was ordered to the Internal Affairs Department (hereinafter “IAD”) to be \ninterviewed by Sergeant Brad Wagner (hereinafter “Sgt. Wagner”).   \n164 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 165 of 219\n \n1201.  Plaintiff Knight attended the meeting with her husband, Fred Knight (hereinafter “Mr. \nKnight”). IAD told Mr. Knight he couldn’t sit in on the interview because he was a potential \nwitness.  \n1202.  In the interview, Plaintiff Knight was played a tape recording of a message left by a female \nvoice that stated:  “Hey Fred your wife is not at work.  She is having an affair with Captain Shelton, \nand she is with him right now.” \n1203.  At first, Plaintiff Knight thought she was called in to IAD to be accused of having an affair \nwith Captain Shelton, which she vehemently denied.    \n1204.  She soon discovered that she was being accused of having made the call to a different \n“Fred,” the husband of Officer Janice Oliver. \n1205.  Mr. Knight was taken into a separate room where IAD played him the tape to see if he \ncould identify the voice as Plaintiff Knight’s.  Essentially, IAD was trying to enlist Mr. Knight as \na witness against his wife.   Mr. Knight made clear that the voice was not Plaintiff’s. \n1206.  Plaintiff Knight immediately offered IAD her phone records to prove that she was not the \nperson who made the call at issue.  She also offered to take a polygraph and for a voice recognition \nexpert to be used to prove that the voice on the recording was not hers.  \n1207.  Plaintiff Knight passed the polygraph exam, but Chief Lanier would not accept that she \nwas innocent, despite the fact that Plaintiff’s phone records also proved she did not make the call, \nand was on patrol when the call was made. \n1208.  The MPD refused to pay for the voice recognition expert, so Plaintiff Knight paid for it \nherself to prove her innocence.  She took the voice recognition test in the presence of IAD to ensure \nthat they could not question the validity of the test.  \n165 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 166 of 219\n \n1209.  The voice recognition expert concluded that the voice on the message was not Plaintiff \nKnight’s voice.  \n1210.  Sgt. Wager informed Chief Lanier that Plaintiff Knight was innocent, but Chief Lanier did \nnot care.  She refused to reverse Plaintiff Knight’s punitive transfer out of SOD.   \n1211.  Plaintiff Knight met with Chief Alfred Durham (hereinafter “Chief Durham”) to complain \nabout the unfair way she was being treated.   \n1212.  Chief Durham stated that Plaintiff Knight would not be reinstated to SOD despite having \npassed all the tests proving her innocence, because Officer Oliver still “believed” that Plaintiff had \nmade the call.   \n1213.  Chief Lanier chose to appease Officer Oliver at Plaintiff Knight’s expense because Chief \nLanier and Officer Oliver were close friends.  \n1214.  Plaintiff Knight escalated matters by reaching out to Mayor Bowser’s office.  An aid in the \nMayor’s office informed Plaintiff that her complaint would be investigated by the Office of the \nInspector General (hereinafter “OIG”). \n1215.  In December of 2014, nearly a year later, OIG called Plaintiff Knight to ascertain if she \nhad been transferred back to SOD.  She stated that she had not. Two weeks after that, Plaintiff \nKnight was transferred back to SOD.   \n1216.  Eventually, Officer Oliver was fired for making false statements about having an affair. \nCapitan Shelton only received a letter of prejudice after making false statements, and for going to \nMaryland to engage in an illicit affair while on the clock. A few months later, he was arrested for \nDUI. He suffered no additional disciplinary action.  \n1217.  Chief Lanier was not disciplined for abusing of her power, or for retaliating against Plaintiff \nKnight. \n166 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 167 of 219\n \n1218.  Officers in SOD received scheduled overtime because of the staffing needs.  When Plaintiff \nKnight was reinstated to SOD, she was not given back pay for the overtime pay amount she had \nbeen wrongfully denied.  \n1219.  During  Plaintiff  Knight’s  absence  from  SOD,  the  leadership  of  the  department  had \nchanged.  When she returned, the SOD Lieutenant was Guillermo Rivera (hereinafter “Lt. Rivera”) \nand the Captain was Jeffrey Carroll (hereinafter “Cpt. Carroll). \n1220.  Lt. Rivera immediately began to disparage and retaliate against Plaintiff Knight, subjecting \nher to far more restrictive work rules and procedures than her colleagues, and repeatedly accused \nher of things she had not done, and spread disparaging rumors about her. \n1221.  Plaintiff Knight went to her supervisor, Sgt. Jane Barrientos (hereinafter “Sgt. Barrientos), \nto complain about the way she was being treated, and asked that Sgt. Barrientos go with her to talk \nto Lt. Rivera about his constant disparaging comments about her.  Lt. Rivera was dismissive and \ndisrespectful during the meeting, refusing to change his inappropriate behavior.  \n1222.  The incessant bullying and disparagement from Lt. Rivera and others in SOD took its toll \non Plaintiff Knight, causing her extreme stress and anxiety. \n1223.  When a position on the Crash Review Board (hereinafter “CRB”) was posted as open, \nPlaintiff Knight leapt at the opportunity.   \n1224.  Plaintiff Knight emailed Commander Stephen Sund (hereinafter Cdr. Sund) to inquire \nabout the position, and was immediately told “no,” without any explanation. \n1225.  A few days later, Cdr. Sund emailed Plaintiff Knight indicating that he would allow her to \ntake the assignment.  \n1226.  Upon her arrival, she was informed that Cpt. Carroll would not allow Plaintiff Knight to \nbe placed in the CRB office, and that she would have to be moved into the Administrative Office \n167 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 168 of 219\n \nso she “could be watched.”  This was yet another instance of disparate treatment Plaintiff Knight \nendured.  \n1227.  Plaintiff Knight complained to Cdr. Sund by email about the way she was being treated \ndifferently than others, and unfairly singled-out for supervisory scrutiny.   \n1228.  Eventually Cdr. Sund allowed Plaintiff to work in the CRB office she was assigned to, but \nmade sure she was aware that it was a trial assignment, to undermine her confidence in the position. \n1229.  In October of 2015, a letter from the OIG’s office acknowledging receipt of Plaintiff \nKnight’s complaint regarding the unfair and retaliatory transfer out of SOD, stating that the OIG \noffice considered the matter closed once she was transferred back to SOD. \n1230.  Plaintiff Knight attempted to contact Daniel Lucas (hereinafter “Mr. Lucas”) in the OIG’s \noffice to inform him that she felt she was still being retaliated against, and to seek accountability \nfor those who had falsely accused her.   \n1231.  Mr. Lucas did not acknowledge or respond to either Plaintiff Knight’s phone calls or her \nemails to him. \n1232.  Four months later, in February 2016, Plaintiff Knight was informed that she was being \nmoved from the supervisory control of Sgt. Barrientos to that of Sgt. Terry Thorne (white male), \nwho sat in a different building.   \n1233.  The explanation that was given for the change was that CRB, which investigated vehicle \naccidents,  was  “somewhat  like  traffic,”  so  Plaintiff  Knight  needed  to  be  under  the  Traffic \nDepartment. \n1234.  In reality, this was another act of retaliation, removing Plaintiff from the supervision of a \nfemale Sergeant whom Plaintiff Knight was comfortable working for, to a white male Sergeant \nwho later undertook a scheme to push her out of MPD. \n168 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 169 of 219\n \n1235.  On information and belief, this move was orchestrated by Chief Lanier to retaliate against \nPlaintiff Knight for going to OIG with a complaint about the unfair reassignment from SOD.  \n1236.  Due to some promotions in the Spring of 2016, Plaintiff Knight reported to Cpt. Robert \nGlover (hereinafter “Cpt. Glover”). \n1237.  Cpt. Glover was openly rude and hostile to Plaintiff Knight from the beginning of her \ntenure working under him.  \n1238.  Cpt. Glover’s animus towards Plaintiff Knight is demonstrated in an incident in June of \n2016 in which Plaintiff Knight was directed by Cdr. Carroll to send an overdue car accident case \nlist to the Professional Development Bureau (hereinafter “PDB”).   \n1239.  Plaintiff Knight complied with the directive by sending an email to the administrative inbox \nof the PDB. \n1240.  Lieutenant James Brown (hereinafter “Lt. Brown”) called Plaintiff Knight to ask why she \nwas inquiring about cases that were more than a year old.  She informed him that she had been \ndirected to do so by Cdr. Carroll.  \n1241.  Plaintiff Knight later was informed that Lt. Brown complained to Cpt. Glover about \nPlaintiff Knight, and accused Plaintiff Knight of sending him a nasty and unprofessional email. \n1242.  Cpt. Glover became irate at Plaintiff, without asking her anything about the exchange, and \ninsisted that an investigation be launched into her actions.  He further asserted that Plaintiff Knight \nneeded “to be watched.” \n1243.  Plaintiff Knight sent an email to her entire chain of command, attaching the email at issue, \nand defending her actions.  She asked the team to conduct a thorough investigation, and to hold \nLt. Brown accountable if his accusation proved to be unfounded. \n169 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 170 of 219\n \n1244.  Cdr. Carroll ultimately concluded that Plaintiff Knight had done nothing wrong, but no \ndisciplinary action was taken against Lt. Brown for the false accusation, or for Cdr. Glover’s ill-\nconceived and unjustified overreaction.  \n1245.  In response, and as a further act of retaliation, Cdr. Glover went to the Time and Attendance \nOffice and asked Officers Eric Coates and James Jaffe to hyper-scrutinize Plaintiff Knight’s time \nentries, accusing Plaintiff Knight of “egregious” abuse and theft of paid time (a very serious \noffense). \n1246.  Upon being informed that Cdr. Glover had, without any basis in fact, accused Plaintiff \nKnight of stealing time, Plaintiff Knight had to again involve Cdr. Carroll. \n1247.  When Plaintiff Knight went to Cdr. Carroll’s office and tried to explain how she was being \ntargeted for personal retribution and attack by Cpt. Glover, Cdr. Carroll dismissed her concerns, \nand all but ignored her, responding that Plaintiff Knight just had “a problem with everyone.” \n1248.  Cdr. Carroll did not take Plaintiff Knight’s allegations seriously, and did not feel that it \nwas his responsibility to address and remedy the animus, disparate treatment, and false accusations \nmade by Cpt. Glover.  \n1249.  Cdr. Carroll further admonished Plaintiff Knight because her email to the PDB admin \ninbox embarrassed Lt. Brown, even though it was sent at Cdr. Carroll’s instruction, and in no way \nwas addressed specifically to Lt. Brown.   \n1250.  When Cdr. Carroll made clear that he was not going to do anything to address the unfair \nand disparate treatment that Plaintiff Knight was enduring, she informed him that she was going \nto speak to Chief Green. \n170 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 171 of 219\n \n1251.  When Cdr. Carroll asked Plaintiff Knight what she expected Chief Green to do, she \ninformed him that she expected  both  of them to  put  a stop  to Cpt. Glover’s campaign of \nharassment, and false accusations.   \n1252.  Plaintiff Knight left the meeting with Cdr. Carroll feeling defeated, having been informed \nby her senior manager that he did not believe it was his obligation to ensure that Plaintiff Knight \nhad a fair and non-discriminatory work environment.  \n1253.  When she got back to her desk, Plaintiff Knight sent Cdr. Carroll the email that Cdr. Carroll \nhad claimed “embarrassed” Lt. Brown, just to make a record of what it was that had caused the \nfury and backlash. \n1254.  On or about June 16, 2016, Cdr. Carroll sent a responsive email confirming that Plaintiff \nKnight had not done anything wrong and stated that he would speak with Cpt. Glover.  \n1255.  In 2017, Plaintiff Knight became an active union representative, and Cdr. Carroll was \npromoted to be Bureau Chief of the Homeland Security Department (hereinafter “HSB”).  Cpt. \nGlover became the Administrative Captain for SOD, which fell under HSB, and Cpt. Rivera was \npromoted to Commander of SOD. \n1256.  As union representative, Plaintiff Knight started to receive complaints from fellow officers \nabout the way Cpt. Glover was treating people.  She passed on their concerns and complaints to \nCdr. Rivera.  \n1257.  In 2018, Plaintiff Knight again became the target of a campaign of harassment and \ndisparate  treatment.    This  was  manifested  by hyper-scrutiny  of  her  work  assignments,  and \nchanging Plaintiff Knight’s assignments without informing her, to cause confusion and chaos in \nher work schedule.  \n171 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 172 of 219\n \n1258.  Plaintiff Knight was so disdained by her leadership that one of them, Lt. Darian Jones \n(hereinafter “Lt. Jones”), took to pretending that he was mistaking Plaintiff Knight for Sgt. Boyd, \na large African American male officer with a full beard.  It was a thinly veiled attempt to denigrate \nand disparage Plaintiff Knight’s appearance, that Lt. Jones engaged in on several occasions.  \n1259.  When  Plaintiff  Knight  complained  to  Cdr.  Rivera  about  the  blatant  animosity  and \ndisrespect from Lt. Jones, Cdr. Rivera dismissed her concern, claiming that Lt. Jones had a right \nto “inquire about resources.” \n1260.  Lt. Jones had such hostility to Plaintiff Knight, that he chastised a subordinate, Sgt. Keith \nJackson (hereinafter “Sgt. Jackson”), for giving Plaintiff Knight an overtime opportunity, and \nmade clear that he did not want Plaintiff Knight assigned to Special Events Department for plum \nassignments. \n1261.  Sgt Jackson also received a call from Lt. Margiotta, the Lieutenant over the Events Section, \ndemanding to know why Plaintiff Knight was working in Special Events. \n1262.  Sgt. Jackson later informed Plaintiff Knight that she was “hot,” a term used in MPD to \nrefer to officers who are unwelcome and targeted for bullying and retaliation.   \n1263.  He told Plaintiff Knight that because Lt. Jones did not like her, he could no longer assign \nPlaintiff Knight to overtime for the Special Events department, thus isolating her, retaliating \nagainst her, and making her subject to disparate treatment and a hostile work environment.  \n1264.  After this, and several other incidents that made clear that Plaintiff Knight was being \ntargeted for bullying and retaliation, on or about March 23, 2019, Plaintiff Knight sent an email to \nChief Newsham requesting to speak to him about the hostile work environment she was being \nsubjected to.  \n172 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 173 of 219\n \n1265.  Approximately a week later, Cdr. Rivera sent an email to the entire department stating that \nthe EEO team would be addressing the department on EEO policy, but did not mention how the \ndepartment was treating Plaintiff Knight.  \n1266.  In June of 2019, tensions with Cpt. Glover escalated again.  Plaintiff Knight was part of a \nteam tasked with formulating a Memorial Day Schedule for 2020.   \n1267.  Cpt. Glover was combative and hostile during the entire meeting, and during the meeting, \ndecided he was going to conduct a separate meeting with his “Admin” team.  Plaintiff Knight was \nostensibly part of the “Admin” team. \n1268.  Cpt. Glover adjourned the meeting, and Plaintiff Knight left to go back to work. On her \nway out, she ran into one of the attendees who informed Plaintiff Knight that Cpt. Glover was \nconducting a meeting with everyone but Plaintiff Knight. \n1269.  When Plaintiff Knight knocked on the door to enter, Cpt. Glover opened the door, told \nPlaintiff Knight she wasn’t invited, and slammed the door in her face.  This act was in violation of \nDepartment policy on professionalism.  \n1270.  Furthermore, Cpt. Glover informed the people in the meeting that they were no longer to \nshare information with Plaintiff Knight, and to change all the passwords and codes to all systems \nso that Plaintiff Knight could not use them to do her job.  He also informed the team not to ask \nPlaintiff Knight for any assistance.  \n1271.  Plaintiff Knight requested a meeting with Cdr. Rivera, who immediately took Cpt. Glover’s \nside and refused to address the blatant disrespect and inappropriate behavior of Cpt. Glover.  \n1272.  Eventually, Plaintiff Knight met with Chief Carroll because her management team refused \nto take seriously or address the daily disparate and hostile treatment that Plaintiff Knight was being \nsubjected to.   \n173 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 174 of 219\n \n1273.  Plaintiff Knight further informed Chief Carroll that the racism, sexism and retaliation she \nwas being subjected to was also being visited upon other Black women officers. \n1274.  Rather than address the issue with his management team, Chief Newsham asked Alphonso \nLee of EEO to reach out to Plaintiff Knight to listen to her “concerns.”   \n1275.  But instead of actually listening to, or trying to address, any of Plaintiff Knight’s concerns \nand claims, Mr. Lee gave Plaintiff Knight information on getting EEO “counseling,” and let her \nknow that she had a right to file a complaint with the District of Columbia Office of Human Rights \n(hereinafter “OHR”). \n1276.  On or about October 1, 2019, Plaintiff Knight went to the Deputy Mayor's office and met \nwith Daisha Winham (hereinafter “Ms. Winham”) to report her concerns about discrimination \nwithing MPD.  \n1277.  Plaintiff  Knight  informed  Ms.  Winham  of  her  concerns  regarding  racial  inequality, \nretaliation and unfair working conditions, provided Ms. Winham with a written summary of \nPlaintiff’s concerns.  \n1278.  Plaintiff Knight was deliberate in informing Ms. Winham of Plaintiff Knight’s fears and \nconcerns about retaliation she would suffer for speaking out.   \n1279.  Specifically, Plaintiff Knight mentioned that she had concerns about Chief Manlapaz of \nthe Internal Affairs Division, who had made it known that he “intended” to retaliate against \nPlaintiff Knight. Plaintiff Knight never received a response from the deputy Mayor’s office. \n1280.  Undeterred,  Plaintiff  Knight  then  went  to  Councilman  Charles  Allen’s  (hereinafter \n“Councilmember Allen”) office requesting to see him.  Plaintiff Knight was instructed to send \nCouncilmember Allen an email, which Plaintiff Knight did. Plaintiff Knight did not receive a \nresponse from the Councilmember’s Office. \n174 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 175 of 219\n \n1281.  On or about October 14, 2019, Plaintiff Knight spoke with Alana Sisnett (hereinafter Ms. \nSisnett) from Mayor Bowser’s office.  \n1282.  Plaintiff Knight spoke with Ms. Sisnett about racial inequality in the promotional and \nhiring process, the practice of some in the MPD of falsifying crime statistics, and the fact that \nMPD EEO appeared to be working on behalf of management, and to the detriment of, and against \ncomplainants.  \n1283.  Plaintiff Knight further asserted that Black women officers were not receiving fair and \nimpartial investigations, and further informed Ms. Sisnett that IAD Chief Manlapaz was making \nit known that he planned to retaliate against Plaintiff Knight for complaining outside the chain of \ncommand.  \n1284.  On or about October 18, 2019, Chief Manlapaz cornered union representative Hiram \nRivera (hereinafter “Officer Rivera), interrogating him about Plaintiff Knight and her activities. \nOfficer Rivera reported back to Plaintiff Knight that Chief Manlapaz was on the  warpath for her.  \n1285.  Later that day, Plaintiff Knight was told that she was under investigation because two cases \nshe worked on were  “missing” from the MPD car accident filing system.  \n1286.  Plaintiff Knight was given a question & answer form by her commander, and told that she \nneeded to send a spreadsheet of her cases to Chief Manlapaz.   \n1287.  Plaintiff Knight asserts that Chief Manlapaz was making good on his promise and threat to \nretaliate against her for complaining about racial and gender discrimination at the MPD. \n1288.  Plaintiff Knight later learned that certain files and hard copy and memos had disappeared \nfrom the files she worked on, for which she was disciplined, even though no evidence was \npresented that she was responsible for removing the missing records.  \n175 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 176 of 219\n \n1289.  Plaintiff Knight asserts that the files were sabotaged to implicate her as part of a scheme to \nretaliate against her for complaining about race and gender discrimination. \n1290.  During Plaintiff Knight’s appeal of the discipline she received, it was discovered and noted \nthat Cdr. Rivera had removed important information from the investigation that was favorable \ntoward Plaintiff Knight.  \n1291.  Lt. Walter Flemins, who investigated the case, had requested that the case against Plaintiff \nKnight be dropped, but Chiefs Carrol and Manlapaz denied the request.  \n1292.  Plaintiff Knight asserts that Chiefs Carrol and Manlapaz denied the request to drop the \ninvestigation  against  Plaintiff  Knight  because  they  were  seeking  a  reason  to  terminate  her \nemployment, and to retaliate against her for engaging in protected activity.  \n1293.  During the ordinary course of her work, Plaintiff Knight received a performance evaluation \ncompleted by her direct supervisor, Sgt. Barrientos.  That performance evaluation, written by the \nperson who directly observed Plaintiff’s performance, gave Plaintiff the highest possible rating of \na five (5). \n1294.  On or about November 27, 2019, Cdr. Rivera informed Sgt. Barrientos that she was no \nlonger going to supervise Plaintiff, and Cdr. Rivera deleted Plaintiff’s completed performance \nevaluation, substituting it with one that he wrote himself.   \n1295.  Cdr. Rivera dropped Plaintiff Knight’s performance score from a five (5), which was \nconsistent with Plaintiff’s rating for the previous ten (10) years, to a three (3).   \n1296.  The purported justification for the drop in rating was the fact that Plaintiff was the subject \nof an investigation initiated by Chief Manlapaz. No other significant performance deficiency was \nidentified to justify the uncharacteristically low rating.  \n176 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 177 of 219\n \n1297.  In December of 2019, Plaintiff Knight had an interview with OHR to discuss her concerns \nabout racial and gender discrimination at the MPD, and the systemic culture of retaliation she had \nbeen subjected to. Plaintiff Knight met with Joy Board (hereinafter “Ms. Board”).  \n1298.  Plaintiff Knight provided Ms. Board with a written copy of her EEOC complaint against \nMPD that included racial inequality, favoritism and unfair working conditions.  \n1299.  Ms. Board told Plaintiff Knight that MPD was past the allotted time for providing her with \nan Exit Letter. Plaintiff Knight responded that the Exit Letter had nothing to do with her complaint.  \n1300.  Ms. Board informed Plaintiff Knight that Mr. Lee knew that OHR was only going to \ninvestigate what was in the Exit Letter.   \n1301.  Plaintiff  Knight  started  to  get  upset  because  once  again,  her  serious  concerns  and \ncomplaints were being brushed off as irrelevant.  \n1302.  Ms. Board agreed to go through the process anyway, but it appeared that this was to placate.  \n1303.  On or about March 18, 2020, Plaintiff received a DocuSign from Ms. Board. The document \naddressed an overtime issue concerning Officer Wells and Cdr. Glover, but none of the racial \ninequality, favoritism and unfair treatment complaints raised by Plaintiff Knight.   \n1304.  On or about March 19, 2020, Plaintiff Knight sent an email to Ms. Board informing her the \nbases of her complaint were not addressed. Plaintiff Knight informed Ms. Board that the write-up, \nwhich only covered an overtime issue, did not address her concerns, and that Plaintiff Knight \nwould therefore not sign it.  \n1305.  Thereafter,  OHR  issued  a  letter  conveying  OHR’s  Administrative  Dismissal  of  the \ncomplaint, despite the fact that it failed to even acknowledge, let alone actually investigate, any of \nthe claims Plaintiff raised in her complaint.   \n177 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 178 of 219\n \n1306.  OHR further indicated that Plaintiff Knight’s complaint was untimely and lacked any merit. \nPlaintiff’s response was sent to OHR the day after she received their correspondence in the mail.  \nIt was in no way untimely. \n1307.  On or about January 16, 2020, Plaintiff Knight testified under oath before Councilmember \nAllen regarding the pattern of falsification of police reports, racial inequalities, and unfair hiring \nand testing practices at the MPD.  \n1308.  Plaintiff Knight asserted to Councilmember Allen that if MPD leadership didn’t do more \nto promote minorities within the next ten (10) years, there would be no minorities at the top levels \nof MPD.  \n1309.  Councilmember Allen specifically asked if Plaintiff Knight was being retaliated against. \nPlaintiff Knight stated that she was, and recounted to Councilmember Allen that she was being \nretaliated against by Chief Manlapaz of IAD.  Councilmember Allen stated that he would get back \nto Plaintiff Knight, but never did. \n1310.  In furtherance of the scheme to retaliate against Plaintiff Knight, she was written up twice \nin February of 2020 for fabricated transgressions.   \n1311.  On or about April 22, 2020, Plaintiff Knight received a phone call from IAD agent Michael \nAmes  (hereinafter  “Agent  Ames”),  informing  her  that  she  was  the  target  of  yet  another \n“investigation.”  \n1312.  Plaintiff Knight immediately told Agent Ames about Chief Manlapaz informing people \nwithin MPD that he intended to retaliate against her, and that he was gunning for her.   \n1313.  Plaintiff Knight put Agent Ames on notice that there was legitimate reason to believe the \ninvestigation was contrived, and was an act of retaliation.  \n178 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 179 of 219\n \n1314.  Agent Ames told Plaintiff Knight that the investigation was about an email she sent to \nOHR,  and  more  specifically,  that  Plaintiff  Knight  had  mentioned  that  she  had  recorded \nCommander Rivera in that email. Information that complainants provide to OHR is supposed to \nremain confidential.  \n1315.  Plaintiff Knight was interviewed nine (9) times about the alleged recording, but not a single \ntime about the content and substance of her OHR complaint.  \n1316.  As a result of the investigation, Plaintiff Knight was informed that she was going to be \nsuspended for twenty-eight (28) days.  At the time, there was no MPD policy against recording \nconversations. \n1317.  It is not a violation of Washington DC law to record a conversation without the prior \nconsent of the person recorded. \n1318.  On or about April 30, 2020, Plaintiff Knight sent an email to Chief Newsham detailing the \nthings that were happening to her.   \n1319.  She implored Chief Newsham to pay attention and act on the discrimination, disparate \ntreatment, and contrived and intentional retaliation and bullying that was taking place at MPD.  \nPlaintiff received no response from Chief Newsham. \n1320.  Through her Union Steward, Officer Rosario, Plaintiff Knight filed a grievance with \nrespect to the suspension, and the union demanded arbitration of the suspension.  The union is not \nrequired to demand arbitration on all grievances, but it did choose to pursue this one.  \n1321.  On  or  about  June  4,  2020,  Plaintiff  Knight  informed  the  MPD  Director  of  Human \nResources, Angela Simpson (hereinafter “Ms. Simpson”), that she was being retaliated against. \n179 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 180 of 219\n \n1322.  On or about July 6, 2020, Plaintiff Knight was ordered back to IAD to speak with agent \nDavid Chumbley (hereinafter “Agent Chumbley”). She appeared at the interview with her Union \nSteward Rosario.  \n1323.  Agent Chumbley was so hostile and aggressive in the interview that Officer Rosario \nstepped in and stopped the interview and asked for another IAD official to intercede.  \n1324.  Approximately a month later, Plaintiff Knight was ordered back to IAD for another \ninterview, but given the hostile and unproductive comportment of Agent Chumbley, Plaintiff was \ninterviewed this time by Captain Pamela Wheeler (hereinafter “Cpt. Wheeler”).  \n1325.  Captain Wheeler asked questions about Plaintiff’s testimony before the city council. \nHowever, Captain Wheeler also tried to convince Plaintiff that she was not being retaliated against \nas a result of that testimony because the investigation and disciplinary action against her began \nbefore the city council testimony occurred.   \n1326.  Plaintiff Knight informed Captain Wheeler that the investigation and discipline was a result \nof multiple complaints against Chief Manlapaz and others, but escalated after the city council \ntestimony.   \n1327.  On or about September 24, 2020, Plaintiff Knight received a memo from Chief Newsham \nin response to her appeal of the 28 days suspension, stating that Plaintiff failed to be forthright \nduring the investigation into her recording of Cdr. Rivera.   \n1328.  Chief Newsham’s memo did not mention any of the claims and concerns Plaintiff Knight \nraised to him, and did not address that the fact that no evidence against Plaintiff Knight was \ndiscovered in the investigation.  It further failed to state why recording Cdr. Rivera would be a \nviolation of MPD policy.  \n180 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 181 of 219\n \n1329.  Plaintiff Knight’s suspension was rescinded, and she instead received a letter of censure.  \nPlaintiff Knight thereafter sought to go back to SOD, her original department. \n1330.  On or about February 17, 2021, Chief Chanel Dickerson (hereinafter “Chief Dickerson”) \ntold Plaintiff Knight to complete a transfer form to go back to her assignment at SOD.  \n1331.  At the time, Plaintiff Knight was temporarily assigned to Chief Dickerson’s office for a \nproject, but by then, the project was complete.  \n1332.  Three days later, on or about February 20, 2021, Chief Dickerson called Plaintiff Knight \nto inform her that Chief Contee refused to allow Plaintiff Knight to go back to SOD, and that Chief \nContee wasn’t going to require that any other department receive Plaintiff Knight.   \n1333.  This was a direct and intentional denial of job and promotional opportunities to Plaintiff \nKnight by Chief Contee, as well as an act that would negatively affect Plaintiff Knight’s pay.   \n1334.  Plaintiff Knight viewed this as an act of retaliation and an adverse employment action to \npunish her for her protected activity.  \n1335.  Because Plaintiff Knight’s only option at that point was to go back to patrol, she feared \nthat any further retaliation would result in loss of her job because there would be nowhere else for \nher to go.   \n1336.  Given that no entity in the District of Columbia was willing to take her claims and concerns \nseriously, and that no member of MPD leadership was willing to restrain the rampant and \nintentional retaliation against Plaintiff Knight, Plaintiff Knight was constructively forced to retire \nfrom the MPD on or about March 24, 2021.  \n1337.  The facts alleged by Plaintiff Knight herein are representative, not exhaustive, of the kind \nof  continuous,  frequent,  repeated  and  recurring  disparate  and  unfair  treatment,  hostility, \n181 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 182 of 219\n \ndisparagement and retaliations she was forced to endure at MPD.  Additional facts in support of \nher claims will be developed in discovery. \nPlaintiff Knight’s Individual Causes of Action \n  Race Discrimination and Retaliation Claims \n1338.  Plaintiff Knight incorporates and restates the allegations contained in the previous \nparagraphs as if fully restated herein. \n1339.  Plaintiff Knight, on her own behalf, asserts herein claims pursuant to Title VII of the Civil \nRights Act of 1964, as amended, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e, et seq.;  the District of Columbia Human \nRights Act, District of Columbia Code § 2-1401.01 et seq., and the Civil Rights Act of 1866 \nDiscrimination Based on Race in the Making and Enforcing of Contracts 42 U.S.C. §1981(a) by \nway of, through and via 42 U.S.C. § 1983. \n1340.  Plaintiff Knight was treated disparately, subjected to a hostile work environment and \nretaliated against for complaining about and opposing the race discrimination she was subjected \nto.  \n1341.  The facts alleged above constitute discrimination, and systematic retaliation severe and \npervasive enough to be compensable. \n1342.  The facts alleged above taken in conjunction with the facts alleged by the other nine (9) \nCRPs, establish that Defendant maintained a pattern and practice of race discrimination against \nBlack women police officers on the basis of race.  \n1343.  The facts alleged by Plaintiff Knight, that establish that she was treated disparately than \nher non-Black-female colleagues, are typical of, and consistent with, the claims of the other nine \n(9) CRPs. \n182 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 183 of 219\n \n1344.  Plaintiff Knight asserts that she was subjected to a hostile work environment because of \nher race, which deteriorated and became more hostile because of her protected activity, and in \nretaliation for her complaints regarding race discrimination. \n1345.  As a direct and proximate cause of the hostile work environment fostered by Defendant, \nPlaintiff Knight was humiliated, embarrassed and made to endure constant stress and anxiety, \ndepression, lack of sleep and other symptoms that caused her severe mental anguish.   \n1346.  Plaintiff Knight has incurred lost wages, loss of reputation and loss of career opportunity \nnow and into the future, and all the other losses stated herein. \n1347.  Plaintiff Knight seeks compensatory damages, and damages for mental pain and suffering, \nabove and beyond recovery as a member of the class, of not less than $300,000.00, plus interest, \ncosts, fees and all other remedies the Court deems appropriate.  \n        Sex Discrimination and Retaliation Claims \n1348.  Plaintiff Knight incorporates and restates all of the allegations contained in the previous \nparagraphs as if fully restated herein. \n1349.  Plaintiff Knight, on her own behalf, asserts herein claims pursuant to Title VII of the Civil \nRights Act of 1964, as amended, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e, et seq., and the District of Columbia Human \nRights Act, District of Columbia Code § 2-1401.01 et seq. \n1350.  Plaintiff Knight was treated disparately, subjected to a hostile work environment and \nretaliated against for complaining about and opposing the gender discrimination she was subjected \nto.  \n1351.  The facts alleged above, if proven, constitute discrimination, and systematic retaliation \nsevere and pervasive enough to be compensable. \n183 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 184 of 219\n \n1352.  The facts alleged above taken in conjunction with the facts alleged by the other nine (9) \nCRPs, establish that Defendant maintained a pattern, practice and custom of race discrimination \nagainst Black women police officers on the basis of sex.  \n1353.  Plaintiff Knight asserts that she was subjected to a hostile work environment because of \nher sex, which deteriorated and became more hostile because of her protected activity, and in \nretaliation for her complaints regarding sex discrimination. \n1354.  The facts alleged by Plaintiff Knight, that establish that she was treated disparately than \nher male colleagues, are typical of, and consistent with, the claims of the other nine (9) CRPs. \n1355.  As a direct and proximate cause of the hostile work environment fostered by Defendant, \nPlaintiff Knight was humiliated, embarrassed and made to endure constant stress and anxiety, \ndepression, lack of sleep and other symptoms that caused her severe mental anguish.   \n1356.  Plaintiff Knight has incurred lost wages, loss of reputation and loss of career opportunity \nnow and into the future, and all the other losses stated herein. \n1357.  Plaintiff Knight seeks compensatory and punitive money damages, and damages for mental \npain and suffering, above and beyond recovery as a member of the class, of not less than \n$300,000.00 plus interest, costs, fees and all other remedies the Court deems appropriate. \nWhistleblower Retaliation Claim \n1358.  Plaintiff Knight incorporates and restates all information and allegations contained in the \npreceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n1359.  Pursuant to the District of Columbia Whistleblower Protection Act D.C. Code § 1-615-51 \net seq., defendants are prohibited from reassigning, terminating or otherwise retaliating against a \nD.C. government employee as a result of that employee’s protected disclosures that the employee \nreasonably believes show gross mismanagement, gross misuse or waste of government resources, \n184 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 185 of 219\n \nand abuse of authority in the connection with the administration of a government program, or a \nviolation of a state, local or federal law, rule or regulation.  \n1360.  Plaintiff Knight was an employee who, as a result of her disclosures to her supervisors, the \nsenior leadership of her department, the EEO Department of the MPD, Assistant Chief Caron, \nChief Newsham, the District of Columbia City Council, the Office of the Mayor and the EEOC \nabout the systemic discrimination in the MPD, and the complicity of the MPD EEO Department \nin perpetuating it and protecting those who engage in it, ethical violations that included leaking \nconfidential  witness  statements,  the  creation  of  a  chilling  and  retaliatory  work  culture  that \ndiscouraged officers from complaining about mistreatment and inappropriate police conduct, \nenjoyed the protection of DCWPA.  \n1361.  As a direct result of Plaintiff Knight’s protected disclosures, Defendant systematically and \ncontinuously  retaliated  against  Plaintiff  Knight,  including  but  not  limited  to  unwarranted \ndisciplinary actions against Plaintiff Knight, isolation and separation from coworkers, unfavorable \ntreatment  and  assignments,  false  and  inaccurate  performance  evaluation  and  ultimately \ntermination. \n1362.  Plaintiff Knight asserts that she was subjected to a hostile work environment because of \nher protected activity, and in retaliation for her complaints regarding discrimination. \n1363.  As a result of Defendants’ actions, Plaintiff Knight suffered significant economic harm in \nthe form of loss of employment, corresponding salary, loss of employment opportunities, damage \nto her professional reputation, and significant mental and emotional distress. \n1364.  Plaintiff Knight was humiliated, embarrassed, and made to endure constant stress and \nanxiety, depression, lack of sleep and other symptoms that caused her severe mental anguish. \n185 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 186 of 219\n \n1365.  Plaintiff Knight has incurred lost wages, loss of reputation and loss of career opportunity \nnow and into the future, and all the other losses stated herein. \n1366.  Plaintiff Knight herein seeks compensatory damages, and damages for mental pain and \nsuffering of not less than $1,0 \n1367.  00,000.00, plus interest, costs, fees, and all other remedies the Court deems appropriate. \nPLAINTIFF LOCKERMAN’S INDIVIDUAL CLAIMS \nFacts Relevant to Plaintiff Lockerman’s Individual Claims \n1368.  Plaintiff Lockerman joined MPD in November 2003 and was first assigned to the Fourth \nDistrict Station. \n1369.  Plaintiff Lockerman was promoted to Sergeant June 2016 and assigned to the Sixth \nDistrict, and was against promoted to Lieutenant in of June 2019, and assigned to the Seventh \nDistrict. \n1370.  In December 2019, Plaintiff Lockerman was transferred to the Second District, per her own \nrequest. \n1371.  On March 5, 2020, Plaintiff Lockerman attended a crime briefing and private lunch with \nCommander Duncan Bedlion (hereinafter “Cdr. Bedlion”) (white male). \n1372.  While Plaintiff Lockerman believed that the luncheon was for professional reasons, Cdr. \nBedlion implied that he wanted to engage in conversation of a personal nature, which made \nPlaintiff Lockerman uncomfortable. \n1373.  The conversation was not sexual per se.  However, Plaintiff Lockerman was alone with her \nboss in a social setting, and she was discomfited the direction of the conversation. \n1374.  From that point forward, Cdr. Bedlion began to retaliate against Plaintiff Lockerman for \nher cool reaction to his attempt at conversation on personal and private matters. \n186 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 187 of 219\n \n1375.  Plaintiff Lockerman was placed on sick leave from March 26 thru April 8, 2020, however, \nPlaintiff Lockerman was assigned two tasks that were due during the time that she was out on sick \nleave. \n1376.  Although Plaintiff Lockerman was away on approved leave, she was issued discipline at \nthe order of Cdr. Bedlion, for not turning in the assignments on time.   \n1377.  It is not MPD policy that officers be disciplined for assignments they miss while they are \non approved leave. \n1378.  While reviewing her evaluation with Captain Edward Bernat (hereinafter “Cpt. Bernat”) \n(now retired), Plaintiff Lockerman was informed that Cdr. Bedlion was urging Cpt. Bernat to place \nPlaintiff Lockerman on a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP).   \n1379.  Capt. Bernat refused, informing Cdr. Bedlion that Plaintiff Lockerman did not deserve to \nbe placed on a PIP.   \n1380.  It was nevertheless very concerning to Plaintiff Lockerman that Cdr. Bedlion was so angry \nat being rebuffed that he would try to attack her fitness as an officer and impede her career. \n1381.  On or about October 3, 2020, Plaintiff Lockerman was issued discipline for failing to post \non the Next-Door application, which is a social media platform designed to inform the community \nof crimes in the area of public interest, or in which the MPD is seeking information from the public.   \n1382.  Plaintiff Lockerman explained that there was an arrest made in that situation, so there was \nno further danger to the public, or need for information from the public, which is why Plaintiff \nLockerman didn’t think that it was necessary to make the post. Nevertheless, discipline was issued.  \n1383.  Plaintiff  Lockerman  scheduled  a  meeting  with  Cdr.  Bedlion  and  Cpt.  Brian  Bray \n(hereinafter “Cpt. Bray”) to discuss the discipline for not posting on the Next-Door app.  Cdr. \nBedlion spent the entire meeting berating and denigrating Plaintiff Lockerman.   \n187 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 188 of 219\n \n1384.  During the meeting, Cdr. Bedlion stated that he didn’t think favorably of employees that \nmade requests to transfer from one district to the next (although this is common practice at MPD, \nand two other white Lieutenants were transferred as well).   \n1385.  Cdr. Bedlion also falsely accused Plaintiff Lockerman of having issues with her work \nperformance in the Seventh District.  In fact, Plaintiff Lockerman had no major disciplinary issues \nand was never placed on a PIP at the Seventh District. \n1386.  Cdr. Bedlion further stated to Plaintiff Lockerman that he took pride in having made other \npeople cry who had sat in the same chair that she was sitting in, in the past.  Cdr. Bedlion was \nboastful of the fact that he made other people cry, and appeared to have made the comment to \nintimidate and threaten Plaintiff Lockerman. \n1387.  It is MPD policy, and in accordance with COVID-19 protocols, that officers wear a face \nmask while on duty and in an enclosed space. \n1388.  In late 2020, Plaintiff Lockerman directed a subordinate to put his mask on properly per \nthat Executive Order.   \n1389.  The subordinate officer felt offended that he was directed to put his mask on (which should \nhave been on anyway) and filed a complaint against Plaintiff Lockerman.   \n1390.  Cdr. Bedlion ordered his subordinate Captain Peter Frenzel (hereinafter “Cpt. Frenzel”) to \nbegin  an  administrative  investigation  into  Plaintiff  Lockerman  for  a  “Potential  Orders  and \nDirectives Violation” for giving the subordinate a lawful directive. \n1391.  Plaintiff  Lockerman  was  ultimately  exonerated  by  Assistant  Chief  Lamar  Green \n(hereinafter “Asst. Chief Green”), however Plaintiff Lockerman was made to endure long and \nstressful investigation for no reason. \n188 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 189 of 219\n \n1392.  The subordinate she directed to cover his face was out of order, putting other officers at \nrisk, as well as being insubordinate to a superior officer.  \n1393.  By treating Plaintiff Lockerman as if she was at fault, and as if she did not have proper \nauthority to direct her subordinates to comply with directives, Cdr. Bedlion directly undermined \nPlaintiff Lockerman, diminished her in the eyes of her colleagues and subordinates, and maligned \nher character. \n1394.  Plaintiff Lockerman complained about her unfair treatment and excessive punishment by \nCdr. Bedlion to Assistant Chief Green.  He advised Plaintiff Lockerman to take her complaint to \nMPD EEO.   \n1395.  On or about February 18, 202, Plaintiff Lockerman made a complaint to EEO, outlining \nthe pattern of retaliation she was being subjected to by Cdr. Bedlion.  She spoke with EEO \nCounselor Doreen Haines, and gave details of what Cdr. Bedlion was doing to her. \n1396.  EEO did not sustain the complaint and directed Plaintiff Lockerman to resolve the matter \nwith her chain of command.  Nothing further was done. \n1397.  Although Plaintiff Lockerman made a post on Next Door within a few hours of the \noccurrence of the crime, which was fully compliant with the general order on such posts, Cdr. \nBedlion nevertheless issued Plaintiff Lockerman a Letter of Prejudice for not making a post  to the \nNext-Door app in what he unilaterally deemed to be a “timely manner.” \n1398.  On information and belief, Cdr. Bedlion held Plaintiff Lockerman to a different standard \nthan the other lieutenants when it came to timely posting on Next Door. \n1399.  For example, on or about March 3, 2021, Lieutenant Darren Haskis (hereinafter “Lt. \nHaskis”), a white male officer, failed to post a social media notification for several hours after \nbeing relieved of duty.  On information and belief, Lt. Haskis was not reprimanded.   \n189 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 190 of 219\n \n1400.  Not only is Lt. Haskis a white male, but he is perceived to be a friend and favorite of Cdr. \nBedlion. \n1401.  On or November 20, 2020, Plaintiff Lockerman contracted COVID-19, and was placed on \nadministrative leave by human resources.   \n1402.  Cdr. Bedlion ordered his subordinate, Cpt. Bray to instruct the time and attendance clerk, \nMs. Joann Coombs (hereinafter “Ms. Coombs”), to dock Plaintiff Lockerman’s earned annual \nleave for her time off, which is fraud and against policy. Ms. Coombs managed the situation, and \ndid not dock Plaintiff for the COVID-19 time off.  \n1403.  No action was taken against Cdr. Bedlion for issuing an unlawful and retaliatory directive \nto the Time and Attendance clerk. \n1404.  On or about April 5, 2021, Cdr. Bedlion emailed Plaintiff Lockerman directing her to join \nthe evening and midnight shift officers in meeting with the program director for the Latin \nAmerican Youth Center (hereinafter “LAYC”), the management of the building that housed the \nLAYC, and a private citizen who was complaining about the noise and presence of the LAYC \nkids. \n1405.  Plaintiff Lockerman reached out and spoke to the LAYC Program Director, the building \nowner and the private citizen, and attempted to address the issues.  However, she directed her \nsubordinate sergeant to attend the on-site meeting, because she was scheduled for her bi-annual \nphysical on that evening, which had been scheduled for months, and which she was not allowed \nto reschedule.  \n1406.  Commander Bedlion directed Cpt. Frenzel to issue a letter of counseling regarding this \nbecause, in his opinion, going to the clinic for a mandatory physical did not excuse her from \narranging a meeting in front of the building.   \n190 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 191 of 219\n \n1407.  This confused Plaintiff Lockerman because it was her understanding that the meeting was \nto  resolve  the  issue,  which  Plaintiff  Lockerman  was  able  to  accomplish  through  phone \nconversation.   \n1408.  To the extent that Cdr. Bedlion wanted a physical police presence in front of the building, \nthere was no reason why Plaintiff Lockerman’s sergeant could not provide that presence and \nvisibility. \n1409.  It is important to note that Plaintiff Lockerman’s physical exam was late in the evening and \nthe building management and staff of the LAYC were not on-site at 10 pm, therefore the issue \ncould not have been resolved at that time. \n1410.  Because of Cdr. Bedlion’s unreasonable demand, Plaintiff Lockerman was put in an \nuntenable situation.  She would have been disciplined for missing the physical, and was disciplined \nfor not following Cdr. Bedlion’s exact instruction. \n1411.  Nevertheless, Cdr. Bedlion ordered Cpt. Frenzel to issue to Plaintiff Lockerman a “letter \nof counseling,” which is not a standard MPD form, but something that Cdr. Bedlion invented to \nuse in his department. \n1412.  On or about May 6, 2021, Plaintiff Lockerman became ill with a sinus infection.  She \ninformed Cpt. Bray that she was ill, and was opting to take an optional sick leave  (a three-day \nperiod) that would have her off on the next shift.   \n1413.  Cdr. Bedlion found out about it, and ordered Cpt. Bray to force Plaintiff Lockerman to go \nto the clinic if she wanted the time off, which is in violation of the MPD rules, and was yet another \nact designed to harass and inconvenience her. \n1414.  Cpt. Bray left Plaintiff Lockerman a message that she was being ordered to the clinic while \nshe was on sick leave, unless she accepted an overtime assignment on the next Saturday, which \n191 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 192 of 219\n \nwas previously scheduled as a vacation day for Plaintiff Lockerman, and had been set months \nprior. \n1415.  Plaintiff Lockerman asserts that this was retaliatory and punitive, and done simply to make \nher miserable, and take from her earned time off. \n1416.  On or about May 19, 2021, Plaintiff Lockerman actually received the letter of counseling \nfrom Cpt. Frenzel about the LAYC incident. \n1417.  On or about July 19, 2021, Plaintiff Lockerman was issued another letter of counseling for \nfailing  to  respond  and  notify  the  community  by  emailing    the  local  stakeholders  of  a \nrobbery/kidnapping that occurred in her assigned area.  Plaintiff Lockerman was not the Watch \nCommander on the night of the incident.   \n1418.  Cpt. Bray was the watch commander that evening, and it was the responsibility of the \nWatch Commander to make the notifications to the community during their shift, which he did.  \nHad Plaintiff Lockerman also made the notification, it would have been duplicative and confusing.  \n1419.  Again, Plaintiff Lockerman was disciplined for something that was not her responsibility, \nand not in accordance with department rules.  And once again, the order to discipline Plaintiff \nLockerman came from Cdr. Bedlion, in furtherance of his scheme to harass her. \n1420.  Plaintiff Lockerman took two weeks of annual leave from August 5 thru August 21, 2021.  \n1421.  During that time Ms. Coombs stated that she was approached by Cdr. Bedlion, demanding \nto know who authorized Plaintiff Lockerman’s leave, because there was a staffing shortage at the \ntime.   \n1422.  Although, there were obviously several Departmental Lieutenants who were not working \nat that time (hence the shortage), Cdr. Bedlion only inquired about Plaintiff Lockerman.  \n192 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 193 of 219\n \n1423.  Plaintiff Lockerman was again scheduled for annual leave for September 5 thru September \n14, 2021.  The administrative Lieutenant, Michael Hamelin (hereinafter “Lt. Hamlin”), asked \nPlaintiff Lockerman if she could cancel leave for the 5th  of September, and Plaintiff Lockerman \nagreed.   \n1424.  Plaintiff Lockerman also requested to have the leave she had scheduled for September 12-\n14, 2021, cancelled.   However, Cdr. Bedlion denied her request.   There was no plausible \njustification for the denial, other than spite. \n1425.  Plaintiff Lockerman called Mr. Mark Viehmeyer (hereinafter “Mr. Viehmeyer”), Labor \nRelations, on or about Thursday, September 2, 2021, and left a message regarding this ongoing \nissue with Cdr. Bedlion. \n1426.  On or about September 8, 2021, Plaintiff Lockerman went to Mr. Viehmeyer’s office and \nspoke with him in person, because he had failed to return her call.   \n1427.  Plaintiff Lockerman was directed to attempt to resolve the issue with Assistant Chief \nEmerman (hereinafter “Asst. Chief Emerman”). \n1428.  On September 8, 2021, Plaintiff Lockerman briefly met with Assistant Chief Emerman, \nand he advised her that she could cancel her leave and return to work on September 12, 2021. \n1429.  Plaintiff Lockerman had another scheduled meeting with Assistant Chief Emerman on or \nabout  September 14, 2021, wherein  she reported the hostile working environment  she was \nenduring because of Cdr. Bedlion.  Plaintiff specifically asserted that she believed she was being \ntargeted because of her race and gender. \n1430.  Asst. Chief Emerman advised that he would speak with Cdr. Bedlion regarding the \nsituation, and get back to her. \n193 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 194 of 219\n \n1431.  On or about, September 15, 2021, Plaintiff Lockerman met with Cpt. Frenzel, wherein she \nwas served with an official reprimand for failing to notify the community stakeholders of an \nincident that took place while Plaintiff Lockerman was on leave. \n1432.  The Watch Commander for that shift had properly notified the community stakeholders of \nthe event.  So, there was no reason or need for Plaintiff Lockerman to renotify the community, and \nshe was not scheduled to return to work until the next shift. \n1433.  Plaintiff Lockerman was also served with a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP), even \nthough Cpt. Frenzle advised Plaintiff Lockerman that she would be receiving a favorable annual \nevaluation. \n1434.  It was stated in the PIP that Plaintiff Lockerman’s days off would be changed due to her \n“need of more supervision,” although it was unclear why such was necessary. \n1435.  Importantly, the change of days-off did not included Saturday night, which is the busiest \nnight of the week, and ostensibly the night in which Plaintiff Lockerman would need the most help \nand supervision.   \n1436.  During the conference, Cpt. Frenzel brought up old incidents from Plaintiff Lockerman’s \ntenure in the Seventh District.  Plaintiff Lockerman transferred from the Seventh District almost \ntwo years, prior.  This unfair rehashing of stale and irrelevant events was indicative of the \nmanagement team’s concerted effort to look for reasons to attack Plaintiff Lockerman.  \n1437.  During the conference, Cpt. Frenzel mentioned that Plaintiff had late correspondence.   \nPlaintiff Lockerman clarified that she had not had any late correspondence during the PIP period.   \n1438.  Cpt. Frenzel admitted that the late correspondence was from more than a year prior, under \na different Captain, and that it had occurred while Plaintiff was on sick leave.   \n194 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 195 of 219\n \n1439.  Plaintiff asked why Cpt. Frenzel was bringing up a deficiency that was stale, had already \nbeen addressed, and really wasn’t a fair criticism in the first place.  He had no response. \n1440.  According to MPD policy, it is not proper to base a PIP on deficiencies that occurred over \na year prior to the rating period.  Cpt. Frenzle was basically saying that he would be rating Plaintiff \nLockerman in 2022, for something that supposedly occurred in 2020. \n1441.  During the conference, Cpt. Frenzel mentioned Plaintiff Lockerman’s relationships with \nher co-workers.  He admitted, however, that he was only speaking of the subordinate officer that \nPlaintiff Lockerman directed to wear a mask, and a lieutenant who was only briefly assigned to \nthe district, and with whom Plaintiff Lockerman had never actually worked.   \n1442.  By contrast, several officers have filed complaints against Cdr. Bedlion, and he has not \nbeen disciplined in any way for his abusive behavior and poor relationship with his subordinates. \n1443.  Plaintiff Lockerman asserts that this is another example of race and gender discrimination \nand disparate treatment at MPD. \n1444.  Plaintiff herein asserts that the PIP, the discipline and the change in schedule are acts of \nretaliation against her for complaining of race and gender discrimination. \n1445.  Plaintiff asserts herein that her EEO Complaint was not fully and fairly investigated, and \nthat she is being victimized by unfair policies and procedures in the EEO process. \n1446.  In yet another gambit to target Plaintiff Lockerman, Cdr. Bedlion created a schedule in \nwhich all of the Watch Commander duties for the entire midnight shift landed on Plaintiff \nLockerman, and Captain Sharell Williams (black female), and none of those duties were assigned \nto the male management officers of the Second District for that tour. \n195 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 196 of 219\n \n1447.  Plaintiff asserts that Cdr. Bedlion and his subordinate officers were colluding to push her \nout of the MPD, based on unfair, inaccurate and overly harsh discipline, and other management \nactions that violate MPD policy. \n1448.  The facts alleged by Plaintiff Lockerman herein are representative, not exhaustive, of the \nkind of continuous, frequent, repeated and recurring disparate and unfair treatment, hostility, \ndisparagement and retaliations she was forced to endure at MPD.  Additional facts in support of \nher claims will be developed in discovery. \n       Plaintiff Lockerman’s Individual Causes of Action \n    Race Discrimination and Retaliation Claims \n1449.  Plaintiff Lockerman incorporates and restates the allegations contained in the previous \nparagraphs as if fully restated herein. \n1450.  Plaintiff Lockerman, on her own behalf, asserts herein claims pursuant to Title VII of the \nCivil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e, et seq.;  the District of Columbia Human \nRights Act, District of Columbia Code § 2-1401.01 et seq., and the Civil Rights Act of 1866 \nDiscrimination Based on Race in the Making and Enforcing of Contracts 42 U.S.C. §1981(a) by \nway of, through and via 42 U.S.C. § 1983. \n1451.  Plaintiff Lockerman was treated disparately, subjected to a hostile work environment and \nretaliated against for complaining about and opposing the race discrimination to which she was \nsubjected.  \n1452.  The facts alleged above constitute discrimination, and systematic retaliation severe and \npervasive enough to be compensable. \n196 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 197 of 219\n \n1453.  The facts alleged above, taken in conjunction with the facts alleged by the other nine (9) \nCRPs, establish that Defendant maintained a pattern, practice and custom of race discrimination \nagainst Black women police officers on the basis of race.  \n1454.  The facts alleged by Plaintiff Lockerman that establish that she was treated disparately \nthan her non-Black-female colleagues, are typical of, and consistent with, the claims of the other \nnine (9) CRPs. \n1455.  Plaintiff Lockerman asserts that she was subjected to a hostile work environment because \nof her race, which deteriorated and became more hostile because of her protected activity, and in \nretaliation for her complaints regarding race discrimination. \n1456.  As a direct and proximate cause of the hostile work environment fostered by Defendant, \nPlaintiff Lockerman was humiliated, embarrassed and made to endure constant stress and \nanxiety, depression, lack of sleep and other symptoms that caused her severe mental anguish.   \n1457.  Plaintiff  Lockerman  has  incurred  lost  wages,  loss  of  reputation  and  loss  of  career \nopportunity now and into the future, and all the other losses stated herein. \n1458.  Plaintiff Lockerman seeks compensatory and punitive money damages, and damages for \nmental pain and suffering, above and beyond recovery as a member of the class, of not less than \n$300,000.00, plus interest, costs, fees and all other remedies the Court deems appropriate.  \n    Sex Discrimination and Retaliation Claims \n1459.  Plaintiff Lockerman incorporates and restates all of the previous factual allegations \ncontained in this Complaint as if fully restated herein. \n1460.  Plaintiff Lockerman, on her own behalf, asserts herein claims pursuant to Title VII of the \nCivil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e, et seq., and the District of Columbia \nHuman Rights Act, District of Columbia Code § 2-1401.01 et seq. \n197 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 198 of 219\n \n1461.  Plaintiff Lockerman was treated disparately, subjected to a hostile work environment and \nretaliated against for complaining about and opposing the gender discrimination to which she \nwas subjected.  \n1462.  The facts alleged above constitute discrimination, and systematic retaliation severe and \npervasive enough to be compensable. \n1463.  The facts alleged above, taken in conjunction with the facts alleged by the other nine (9) \nCRPs, establish that Defendant maintained a pattern, practice and custom of race discrimination \nagainst Black women police officers on the basis of sex.  \n1464.  The facts alleged by Plaintiff Lockerman that establish that she was treated disparately \nthan her male colleagues, are typical of, and consistent with, the claims of the other nine (9) \nCRPs. \n1465.  Plaintiff Lockerman asserts that she was subjected to a hostile work environment because \nof her sex, which deteriorated and became more hostile because of her protected activity, and in \nretaliation for her complaints regarding sex discrimination. \n1466.

Plaintiff Mitchell was first employed by MPD in September of 1985.  She retired from the \nMPD with 29.5 years of service, on or about March 16, 2015. \n1479.  In 2017, she was asked to come out of retirement and return to the MPD as a Senior Police \nOfficers (“SPO”). \n1480.  She was assigned to partner with Officer Sinobia Brinkley, whom she had partnered with \nfor more twenty (20) years when they were both sworn officers. Officer Brinley (hereinafter \n“Plaintiff Brinkley”) is a CRP in this matter.  \n1481.  At the time Plaintiff Mitchell returned to the ERT Department, Lieutenant Kevin O’Bryant \n(hereinafter “Sgt. O’Bryant”) was still her manager, but was preparing to retire. \n200 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 201 of 219\n \n1482.  On her first day on the job, Sergeant Michael Boyd (hereinafter “Sgt. Boyd”) asked \nPlaintiff Mitchell and Plaintiff Brinkley to meet him in a conference room. \n1483.  When Plaintiffs Mitchell and Brinkley got there, Sgt. Boyd and Detective Elisa Brown \n(hereinafter “Det. Brown”) gave them the insight on the new ERT, which had experienced turnover \nsince they had retired, emphasizing whom Plaintiffs Mitchell and Brinkley should avoid and not \nto trust, because there was a “New Sheriff” in town.      \n1484.  Plaintiffs Mitchell and Brinkley took this as a warning that then Chief of Police Cathy \nLanier operated very differently than her predecessor.  \n1485.  Plaintiffs Mitchell and Brinkley were baffled by the meeting and the warning because they \ndid not work directly for Sgt. Boyd or Det. Brown, and could not fathom their motivation behind \nthis private warning. \n1486.  Sgt. Boyd was responsible for issuing Plaintiffs Mitchell and Brinkley the cruiser they \nwould be using for their day-to-day work.    \n1487.  When they went to the lot to retrieve their vehicles, they were surprised to see that the \nvehicles were two old K-9 cruisers, with the dog cages and other parts stuffed in the trunk.   \n1488.  The cars assigned to Plaintiffs Mitchell and Brinkley had interiors that were covered in dog \nhair and dander that was getting all over their uniforms, along with numerous spiders and insects \nbecause the cars had been sitting idle for months.     \n1489.  Since Plaintiffs Mitchell and Brinkley had to be immediately available for all barricades \nand high-risk warrants, they tried to make the best of it.    \n1490.  Plaintiffs Mitchell and Brinkley both asked that the vehicles be sent to the MPD shop for \ndetailing.  \n201 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 202 of 219\n \n1491.  Plaintiff Mitchell was able to drive her car to the vehicle cleaning area, but Plaintiff \nBrinkley’s vehicle had to be towed because the engine was dead.   \n1492.  A few days later, Plaintiffs Brinkley and Mitchell were informed that they needed to be on \na high-risk detail.    \n1493.  On many of these warrant details, the officers spend a great deal of time inside their \nvehicles, waiting for the “go ahead” to approach a person or structure.   \n1494.  When Plaintiffs Mitchell and Brinkley received their vehicles back from the cleaning \nservice, the cars were not actually cleaned, and there were several containers of the insecticide that \nwas used to kill the spiders and other insects in the back of the vehicles. \n1495.  The insecticide killed the spiders, but it did not kill the fleas, which were still clearly visible \nand moving around the vehicle. \n1496.  At first, Plaintiffs Mitchell and Brinkley went to Sgt. Boyd to obtain different vehicles, \nsince there were other vehicles available.  Sgt. Boyd refused to assign them different vehicles. \n1497.  Perplexed by Sgt. Boyd’s refusal, Plaintiffs Mitchell and Brinkley went to Sgt. Boyd’s \nsuperior, Lieutenant Kenny Taylor (hereinafter “Lt. Taylor”) to get assigned clean vehicles.  Lt. \nTaylor also denied their request.  Notably, that there were multiple clean, operational vehicles \navailable for Plaintiffs Brinkley and Mitchell to use.  \n1498.  Plaintiffs Mitchell and Brinkley then requested a meeting with the (then) Commander \nGuillermo Rivera (hereinafter “Cdr. Rivera”), who seemed very irritated that Plaintiffs had to come \nto him with such a petty issue.    \n1499.  He stated: “This a no-brainer,” or words to that effect, and several days later, Plaintiffs \nMitchell and Brinkley were issued new suitable trucks. \n202 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 203 of 219\n \n1500.  Until the new vehicles arrived, Plaintiffs Mitchell and Brinkley were given permission by \nLt. Taylor to use a white Suburban truck. \n1501.  When Sgt. Boyd realized that Plaintiffs Mitchell and Brinkley were using that Suburban \n(with Lt. Taylor’s permission), he called Plaintiff Mitchell’s phone and began to berate her for \ntaking this vehicle without his permission. \n1502.  Plaintiff Mitchell attempted to explain to Sgt. Boyd that Lt. Taylor had given her and her \npartner permission to use the vehicle.   \n1503.  Sgt. Boyd stated he did not care who gave Plaintiff Mitchell permission. Sgt. Boyd asserted \nthat he didn’t want Plaintiff Mitchell to drive the Suburban.  He gave no reason or explanation for \nhis adamant and illogical position. \n1504.  Sgt.  Boyd  was  screaming  at  Plaintiff  Mitchell  in  a  very  loud,  disrespectful  and \ncondescending tone.     \n1505.  Plaintiff Mitchell then went to Lt. Taylor to complain about the way Sgt. Boyd spoke to \nher and handled the situation.     \n1506.  From that point forward, Sgt. Boyd had personal animus against Plaintiff Mitchell, and \nacted to retaliate against her. \n1507.  In June of 2017, Plaintiff Mitchell was assigned to assist with a high-risk warrant, and to \ngo on a drive-by detail with five (5) other tactical officers, as well as Sergeant Andrew Horos \n(hereinafter “Sgt. Horos”).  Plaintiff Mitchell was the only female officer assigned to this detail. \n1508.  The other officers were ready before Plaintiff Mitchell arrived at work, and they were \nwaiting for her, while chatting with Sgt. Boyd.    \n203 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 204 of 219\n \n1509.  Once Plaintiff Mitchell arrived, she noticed that Officer Eric Watson (hereinafter “Officer \nWatson”) was carrying a unique looking bag.  When she asked what was in it, he responded that \nthere was a drone in the bag. \n1510.  Plaintiff Mitchell was pleasantly surprised, because drones were not available before she \nhad retired from the force.  When Plaintiff Mitchell asked about using official drones, Officer \nWatson admitted it was his personal drone, not one issued by the MPD. \n1511.  Officer Watson indicated that he brought the drone to take arial pictures of the location \nwhere the warrant was to be issued. \n1512.  Apparently, neither Officer Watson nor Sgt. Horos, were aware that the area in which the \nwarrant was to be served was designated a no-fly zone for drones by the FAA.     \n1513.  Officer Watson sent the drone up twice, but eventually, it fell out of the air.  The tracking \ndevice in it indicated it was in the Fort Dupont Park area, so Officer Watson and Sgt. Horos decided \nto go to find it, rather than simply let it be. \n1514.  Plaintiff Mitchell had no power in that situation to do anything but ride along.  Sgt. Horors \nwas the supervisory employee on the team.  \n1515.  Plaintiff Mitchell was texting with Plaintiff Brinkley, who was back at the station and \nwondering what was taking the team so long to return.   A ride-by typically takes less than an hour.     \n1516.  Plaintiff Mitchell and the rest of the men on the detail were driving around for three hours, \nlooking for the drone. By that time, several of the male officers needed to urinate, so they relieved \nthemselves in the woods. \n1517.  For some reason, Sgt. Horos decided to take his penis out and urinate in the van into a \nbottle, instead of getting out with the other guys.    \n204 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 205 of 219\n \n1518.  Everyone in the van could hear and smell Sgt. Horos’ urinate.  This event made Plaintiff, \nthe only female in the van, very uncomfortable. \n1519.  Plaintiff Mitchell intended to report the urination incident, but she had to attend the funeral \nof a family member of a fellow officer shortly after the ride-by was completed. \n1520.  During the funeral, the officers on the ride by team were called back to the station to meet \nwith their Captain. \n1521.  Once  they  met  with  Captain  Robert  Halbileb  (hereinafter  “Cpt.  Halblieb”),  Plaintiff \nMitchell’s  police  powers  were  suspended,  along  with  that  of  the  other  officers,  pending \ninvestigation, even though all officers admitted that she was not the one operating the drone. \n1522.  As mentioned above, Plaintiff had no idea that Officer Watson planned to bring and deploy \nthe drone, and had no idea the area at issue was a no-fly zone for the FAA. \n1523.  She had just returned to MPD from retirement, and had no idea what MPD policy on the \nuse of drones was. She relied on the fact that Sgt. Horos, who was in the van, and who fully  \nparticipated in deploying the drone, knew what he was doing.   \n1524.  To make matters worse, Sgt. Boyd tried to accuse Plaintiff Brinkley, who was at the station \nduring the incident, of  being the one who “snitched” on the others for use of the done. \n1525.  In fact, it was Sgt. Boyd himself who saw the other officers charging the drone in the locker \nroom before they left for the ride-by, who reported the incident.     \n1526.  The only reason Sgt. Boyd could have for lying about Plaintiff Brinkley and saying that \nshe was the one who reported the others, was to cause Plaintiff Brinkley to be shunned and \nretaliated against by the other officers.   \n1527.  Sgt. Boyd knew or should have known that the drone was illegal, and was aware that the \nofficers who were in the locker room prior to ride by were planning on using it.  \n205 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 206 of 219\n \n1528.  Sgt. Boyd but did not warn, or prohibit the other officers from using the drone.    \n1529.  When Plaintiff Mitchell left the Cpt. Hableb’s office, she reported the highly inappropriate \nurinating incident in the van to Sgt. O’Bryant.     \n1530.  Sgt. O’Bryant was shocked, and he notified Lt. Taylor who requested a meeting with \nPlaintiff Mitchell and Sgt. Horos.    \n1531.  Sgt. Horos apologized for his actions, but a few weeks later, he was promoted to lieutenant.  \nOn  information  and  belief,  Sgt.  Horos  was  not  disciplined  in  any  way  for  his  extremely \ninappropriate behavior. \n1532.  Despite the fact that he had participated in illegally operating the drone, on information \nand belief, Sgt. Horos did not suffer any serious adverse consequences for failing to lead in that \nsituation. \n1533.  By contrast, Plaintiff Mitchell was taken off of regular duties and placed on no-contact \norder, able to work only in the station.  On information and belief, Sgt. Horos was not placed on a \nno-contact order, despite being the only official involved in the incident. \n1534.  On or about February 26, 2018, Plaintiff Mitchell was told to report to Capt. Glover.  When \nshe got to Cpt. Glover’s office, Lieutenant Andrew Margiotta (hereinafter “Lt. Margiotta”) was \nalso there.  \n1535.  Capt. Glover asked Plaintiff Mitchell if she had violated her no-contact order by being on-\nscene at a barricade.  \n1536.  Plaintiff Mitchell indicated that she had not, and that she had only assisted Plaintiff \nBrinkley in moving equipment into Plaintiff Brinkley’s vehicle. \n1537.  Nevertheless, Cpt. Glover mandated that Plaintiff Mitchell write an incident report and be \ninvestigated for violating the no-contact order.   \n206 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 207 of 219\n \n1538.  A thorough investigation was conducted into Plaintiff Mitchell’s whereabouts. Video \nfootage from around the scene was pulled and several officers were interviewed. \n1539.  Eventually, it was concluded that the officer who had reported seeing Plaintiff Mitchell at \nthe barricade, had actually seen Plaintiff Brinkley instead. \n1540.   The investigation, which took weeks of valuable police time, fully exonerated Plaintiff \nMitchell.  \n1541.  When Plaintiff Mitchell was finally able to confront the officer who had accused her, Sgt. \nMatthew  Mahl (hereinafter “Sgt. Mahl”), and asked him why he had falsely accused her, he \nresponded by stating “y’all look alike,” or words to that effect.  \n1542.  Sgt. Mahl was not disciplined in any way for making a false report on a fellow officer, \nwhich appeared to be out of spite and potentially racially motivated. \n1543.  On or about March 27, 2020, while in a meeting with Lt. Robinson and Sgt. John Brown \nregarding Plaintiff Mitchell’s tour of duty with Plaintiff Brinkley, the pair of them were told to \n“watch the company you keep,” or words to that effect, which indicated that Plaintiff Mitchell was \nunder close scrutiny by management.  \n1544.  A few weeks later Plaintiff Mitchell was infected with the coronavirus, and was out of \nwork for eight weeks with COVID. \n1545.  On her first day back to work once she was cleared, Plaintiff Mitchell attended roll call as \nusual. \n1546.  That roll call was conducted by Sgt. Luke Foskess, who decided to single out Plaintiff \nMitchell during roll call. \n207 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 208 of 219\n \n1547.  Sgt. Foskess took Plaintiff Mitchell’s temperature and asked her if she had any symptoms, \nas per COVID protocols, but Plaintiff Mitchell was just coming back from sick leave and had just \nbeen cleared by a doctor.  \n1548.  Plaintiff Mitchell responded that she had a slight headache because she had not yet eaten  \nanything, but otherwise was fine.  \n1549.  Sgt. Foskess then ordered Plaintiff Mitchell to go to the Police and Firefighters Clinic for \na fitness for duty evaluation.  \n1550.  In the culture of MPD, being sent for a fitness for duty exam is humiliating and seen as an \nattack on an officer’s reliability.  It undermines them in the eyes of their fellow officers. \n1551.  Rather than being allowed to drive to the clinic herself, an officer was ordered to drive \nPlaintiff Michell to the clinic, which made little sense if Sgt. Foskess was worried that Plaintiff \nMitchell still had COVID-19. \n1552.  While Plaintiff was seen at clinic, the medical provider asked her why she was there.  When \nPlaintiff Mitchell explained she had not eaten lunch yet that day and told him that she had a slight \nheadache, he released Plaintiff Mitchell to return to work. \n1553.  Plaintiff Mitchell was humiliated by this event, and hated that she was undermined in front \nof her colleagues without good cause. \n1554.  There was no reason for Sgt. Foskess to insist that she go for an evaluation because she did \nnot have a fever and had just been cleared for duty.  \n1555.  Not only did this incident single-out Plaintiff, but it also inconvenienced one of her peers.  \nIt also kept her from doing her job. \n1556.  Thereafter Plaintiff Mitchell and Plaintiff Brinkley continued to be targeted for minor \ndiscipline and investigations. \n208 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 209 of 219\n \n1557.  For example, on or about August 28, 2020, Plaintiff Mitchell was working the day shift \ntour during the March On Washington Detail.    \n1558.  When they reported for their tour, Plaintiff Mitchell and Plaintiff Brinkley were advised by \nSgt. Brown to go to the SOD office and write out a form explaining why they had not been at a \nbarricade the night before.  \n1559.  The reason was that they were not on duty, and there was no general order that all day \nofficers had to be available for night duty. \n1560.  Nevertheless, Plaintiff Mitchell was disciplined for a minor infraction when she had done \nnothing wrong.  \n1561.  On or about May 3, 2020, while working on the scene at a barricade at 3237 Hyatt Place \nNW, Plaintiff received a call that her mother had suffered a seizure and was being transported to \nthe hospital emergency room by ambulance. \n1562.  Plaintiff Mitchell’s mother was admitted to the Critical Care unit of the Washington \nHospital Center.  \n1563.  Plaintiff Mitchell was allowed to stay with her mother in the Critical Care unit to help calm \nand ease her mother because the seizure and other medical issues made her mother non-verbal.  \nPlaintiff Mitchell was granted three weeks of unpaid FMLA leave.     \n1564.  However, when she returned to work, she was served with a minor disciplinary action for \nnot being on five barricades that took place while Plaintiff Mitchell was out on approved FMLA \nleave.   \n1565.  To clarify, Plaintiff was not written-up for missing work.  She was written up for missing \nthe barricades themselves.  \n209 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 210 of 219\n \n1566.  There is no basis in the law for disciplining someone for missing work assignments while \non FMLA, and no other officers in Plaintiff Mitchell’s unit were disciplined for missing barricades \nwhile on FMLA leave. \n1567.  Plaintiff Mitchell herein asserts that the discipline she received for missing barricades was \nretaliation for taking FMLA leave, and part of a greater scheme to retaliate against her for opposing \nSgt. Horors’ misconduct. \n1568.  Plaintiff Mitchell filed a grievance on the discipline that was issued to her for missing \nbarricades while she was on approved FMLA leave to take care of her very sick mother.  \n1569.  A few weeks after Plaintiff Mitchell returned to work, she was accidentally stung by a bee \nwhile on duty.   She had a severe reaction to the sting and went to the clinic to be seen by a health \ncare provider.    \n1570.  At the clinic, Plaintiff was prescribed an antibiotic and antihistamine. She then had a \nserious systemic reaction to the medication, and had to be off of work for two weeks to recover. \nShe was placed on paid FMLA leave while she recuperated. \n1571.  Again, while she was on FMLA leave, Plaintiff Mitchell was disciplined for not making it \nto the barricades that had taken place while she was out.  \n1572.  Sgt. Brown went to Plaintiff Mitchell’s home to serve her notification of another form of \ndiscipline, while she was still recuperating from her ordeal with the medication.   \n1573.  Plaintiff Mitchell had to call her Union Steward, Hiram Rosario, and place him on speaker \nphone in order to have Union representation (which she was entitled to) during this meeting. \n1574.  Sgt. Brown stated he did not agree with the discipline, however he was directed by his \nsuperiors to handle it.      \n210 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 211 of 219\n \n1575.  It bears repeating that Plaintiff Mitchell was on approved medical leave when she missed \nthe barricades that were the subject of her discipline.  \n1576.  On information and belief, no other officers in SOD have been written up for missing \nbarricades or other assignments while on approved FMLA leave.  \n1577.  On or around January 17, 2021,  during the days leading up to the inauguration of President  \nBiden, Plaintiff Mitchell was detailed to a joint operations center in Herndon, VA, which is more \nthan an hour and a half drive, each way, for Plaintiff Mitchell. \n1578.  At the time, Plaintiff Mitchell’s supervisors were well aware that she was the sole caregiver \nfor her mother, who had suffered a stroke, and had had several seizures.   \n1579.  In order to have the time to care for her mother, ensure that her mother was fed during the \nday and that she was comfortable, Plaintiff requested 4 hours of intermitted FMLA leave each day \nof the 12-hour shift (6am -6pm), so she could have time to drive back and forth to Herndon and \nstill care for her mother. \n1580.  Plaintiff Mitchell’s request was denied.  The reason she was given was because a different \nagency was paying for her time, which was not relevant to her statutory entitlement to FMLA \nleave. \n1581.  Luckily, Officer Wendell Cunningham (hereinafter “Officer Cunningham”) volunteered to \nwork the extra 4 hours to cover for Plaintiff so she could care for her mother. \n1582.  While this may seem like an innocuous incident, Plaintiff Mitchell had very few options \nwhen it came to caring for her ailing mother because her mother was non-verbal, and cannot \ncommunicate well with hired caregivers. \n1583.  The anxiety and stress that Plaintiff Mitchell endured in trying to work out how she could \nfulfill her duties and still care for her mother was all-consuming. \n211 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 212 of 219\n \n1584.  Had she not been assisted by Officer Cunningham, Plaintiff Mitchell would have likely \nquit her job, rather than allow her mother to go without care. \n1585.  There was no reason for Plaintiff Mitchell to have been put through that sort of stress, \nbecause the joint operations role Plaintiff Mitchell was fulfilling was actually designated for a \nmanagement-level officer, as explained in the emails from Captain Caron and Lt. Robinson. \n1586.  This incident was another example of the disregard and disparate treatment that Plaintiff \nMitchell endured on the job. \n1587.  Plaintiff Mitchell has endured so many small incidents of unfairness and negative treatment \nthat she was constructively forced to retire from MPD, rather than continue in such a toxic \nenvironment. Her last day on the job was September 24, 2021. \n1588.  The facts alleged by Plaintiff Mitchell herein are representative, not exhaustive, of the kind \nof  continuous,  frequent,  repeated  and  recurring  disparate  and  unfair  treatment,  hostility, \ndisparagement and retaliations she was forced to endure at MPD.  Additional facts in support of \nher claims will be developed in discovery. \n  Plaintiff Mitchell’s Individual Causes of Action \n      Race Discrimination and Retaliation Claims \n1589.  Plaintiff Mitchell incorporates and restates all of the allegations contained in the previous \nparagraphs as if fully restated herein. \n1590.  Plaintiff Mitchell, on her own behalf, asserts herein claims pursuant to Title VII of the Civil \nRights Act of 1964, as amended, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e, et seq.;  the District of Columbia Human \nRights Act, District of Columbia Code § 2-1401.01 et seq., and the Civil Rights Act of 1866 \nDiscrimination Based on Race in the Making and Enforcing of Contracts 42 U.S.C. §1981(a) by \nway of, through and via 42 U.S.C. § 1983. \n212 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 213 of 219\n \n1591.  Plaintiff Mitchell was treated disparately, subjected to a hostile work environment and \nretaliated against for complaining about and opposing the race discrimination to which she was \nsubjected.  \n1592.  The facts alleged above constitute discrimination, and systematic retaliation severe and \npervasive enough to be compensable. \n1593.  The facts alleged above, taken in conjunction with the facts alleged by the other nine (9) \nCRPs, establish that Defendant maintained a pattern, practice and custom of race discrimination \nagainst Black women police officers on the basis of race.  \n1594.  The facts alleged by Plaintiff Mitchell that establish that she was treated disparately than \nher non-Black-female colleagues, are typical of, and consistent with, the claims of the other nine \n(9) CRPs. \n1595.  Plaintiff Mitchell asserts that she was subjected to a hostile work environment because of \nher race, which deteriorated and became more hostile because of her protected activity, and in \nretaliation for her complaints regarding race discrimination. \n1596.  As a direct and proximate cause of the hostile work environment fostered by Defendant, \nPlaintiff Mitchell was humiliated, embarrassed and made to endure constant stress and anxiety, \ndepression, lack of sleep and other symptoms that caused her severe mental anguish.   \n1597.  Plaintiff Mitchell has incurred lost wages, loss of reputation and loss of career opportunity \nnow and into the future, and all the other losses stated herein. \n1598.

Code §§ 32-501, et \nseq., Plaintiff Mitchell was entitled to use approved leave for the care of her mother. \n1620.  Plaintiff asserts that MPD is an employer subject to both the federal and District of \nColumbia FMLA provision. \n216 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 217 of 219\n \n1621.  Plaintiff Mitchell asserts that MPD violated both statutes by wrongfully interfering with \nher exercise of statutory rights. \n1622.  Plaintiff Mitchell asserts that she was wrongfully harassed, and disciplined while on FMLA \nleave, and in retaliation for taking FMLA leave.  She also asserts that the discipline she received \nfor missing barricades while on FMLA leave was a violation of both federal and D.C. law, \nconstituted disparate treatment, and was an adverse employment action. \n1623.  Plaintiff Mitchell asserts that MPD’s decision to send a Sergeant to her home while she \nwas on FMLA leave was a violation of the federal and state law, and undertaken to retaliate against \nher for taking statutorily protected leave. \n1624.  Plaintiff Mitchell asserts that she was eligible, entitled and approved to take intermittent \nFMLA leave to care for her mother during the period that she was given an assignment far away \nfrom her home, and that the denial of her request for intermittent FMLA was unlawful, unjustified \nand retaliatory in nature.  \n1625.  The discipline Plaintiff received for missing barricades while on FMLA leave was directly \nand caused by her exercise of statutorily protected rights, and constituted adverse action. \n1626.  Plaintiff Mitchell asserts that MPD denied her FMLA request to place her in an untenable \nsituation in which she would have to choose her employment or caring for a very ill family \nmember, with the express intent to force Plaintiff Mitchell into resigning her employment.  \n1627.  As a direct and proximate cause of Defendant’s interference with Plaintiff Mitchell’s \nexercise of her FMLA rights, Defendant intended, and in fact, caused Plaintiff Mitchell severe \nanxiety, stress and mental anguish, and incumbered her ability to properly care for a very ill family \nmember. \n217 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537-RBW   Document 28   Filed 06/13/22   Page 218 of 219\n \n1628.  As a direct and proximate cause of Defendant’s retaliation against Plaintiff Mitchell’s \nbecause of exercise of her FMLA rights, Defendant intended, and in fact, caused Plaintiff Mitchell \nsevere anxiety, stress and mental anguish, and incumbered her ability to properly care for a very \nill family member. \n1629.  As a direct and proximate cause of Defendant’s denial of Plaintiff Mitchell’s request for \nintermittent FMAL leave, Defendant interfered with Plaintiff Mitchell’s exercise of her FMLA \nrights. Defendant’s actions were intended to cause, and in fact caused Plaintiff Mitchell severe \nanxiety, stress and mental anguish, and incumbered her ability to properly care for a very ill family \nmember. \n1630.  Plaintiff Mitchell asserts that her resignation from MPD was the result of stress caused \nfrom her FMLA and DCFMLA rights being infringed upon, and further states that this loss of \nemployment is significant as it is difficult to find comparable work at her age.  \n1631.  Plaintiff Mitchell herein seeks compensatory damages, back pay, front pay and all other \ncompensation for pain and suffering deemed appropriate by the Court. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \n \n  WHEREFORE,  Plaintiffs  individually  respectfully  pray  that  this  Honorable  Court \nORDER that Defendant: \na.

Plaintiff has exhausted all administrative remedies. \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537   Document 1   Filed 06/07/21   Page 3 of 44\n \n7.  On  or  about  December  23,  2020,  Plaintiff  timely  filed  a  formal  EEO  Charge  of \nDiscrimination  with  the  U.S.  Equal  Employment  Opportunity  Commission  (“EEOC”)  for \ndiscrimination  based  on  race  (African  American),  sex  (female),  disability  (depression)  and \nretaliation for prior and ongoing EEO activity, her claims being based on disparate treatment and \nthe creation of a hostile work environment.   \n8.  On March 8, 2021, the EEOC issued a Dismissal and Notice of Right to Sue, giving \nPlaintiff ninety (90) days to file a civil action. \n9.  Plaintiff now timely files this action pursuant to federal law. \nRELEVANT FACTS COMMON TO ALL CLAIMS \nINITIAL EMPLOYMENT WITH MPD \n11.  Plaintiff began her employment with MPD in October 1988.  She was hired as an officer \nand was a member of the union, Fraternal Order of Police, Lodge # 1 (hereinafter “FOP” or \n“Union”). \n12.  She initially was assigned to the Morals Division and later to Patrol District One.  In 1992, \nshe was chosen for, and assigned to the Special Operations Division (hereinafter “SOD”) as an \nEmergency Response Team Station Clerk.   \n13.  That same year, Plaintiff married fellow MPD officer, Matthew Brinkley.  They both \nserved on the MPD until 2014, when Mr. Brinkley retired.  Plaintiff continued working at the MPD \nwell after he retired.  \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537   Document 1   Filed 06/07/21   Page 4 of 44\n \n14.    SOD ERT unit of the MPD deals with hostage situations and other volatile and delicate \ncircumstances where a person might be barricaded in a building, refusing to cooperate with officer \ndemands, or holding or endangering others. \n15.  SOD is an elite unit, and a desirable and sought-after assignment.  Officers are screened \nand chosen for their suitability to ERT and are trained in crisis management and tactics. \n16.  After about eighteen years in ERT as a negotiator, the Plaintiff was assigned to the DC \nPublic Schools, and served there for approximately two years.   \n17.  To round out her policing experience, Plaintiff requested and was reassigned to a Patrol \nDistrict.  Policing a Patrol District involves working closely with the community, being visible \nand present, as both a resource to residents and to deter malign activities, and handling calls when \nresidents seek police assistance.  \n18.  From approximately 2012 to November of 2016, Plaintiff served continuously in the First \nDistrict Patrol unit without serious employment issues.   \n19.  In November of 2016, Plaintiff became eligible to retire and took retirement from the MPD.  \n20.  In March 2017, Plaintiff was asked to return to active policing because MPD needed to \nincrease its officer headcount, most especially with respect to seasoned officers with specialized \ntraining and skills. \n21.  At  the  time,  MPD  was  bringing  back  strong  and  experienced  officers  as  full-time \nemployees, but employed them by way of individual contracts, not as members of the FOP \nbargaining unit.  \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537   Document 1   Filed 06/07/21   Page 5 of 44\n \n22.  MPD offered Plaintiff a contract to return as a Senior Police Officer (hereinafter “SPO”) \nwithin Special Operations to assist in the selection process and training of new reserve negotiators.  \n23.  Plaintiff’s contract was for a year, renewable annually if she remained able to meet physical \nand other requirements.  \nSECOND EMPLOYMENT TERM WITH MPD \n24.  Plaintiff began her second stint as a DC Police Officer on April 3, 2017, assigned to SOD, \nERT as a negotiator.  At the time, her immediate supervisor, and the person responsible for her \nactual assignments was Sergeant Kevin O’Bryant (Black male). \n25.  However, because SOD was a specialized unit, it had its own administrative chain of \ncommand, responsible for coordination, logistics and allocation of resources such as vehicles and \nprotective equipment. At that time, the administrative Sergeant for SOD ERT was Michael Boyd \n(Black male) (hereinafter “Sgt. Boyd”). \n26.   Plaintiff’s partner at the time was officer Kia Mitchell (Black female) (hereinafter “SPO \nMitchell”).  Plaintiff had served and partnered with SPO Mitchell during her first employment \nwith MPD for approximately twenty years.  They were close confidants, and often shared private \nmatters with each other.  \n27.  Sgt. Boyd treated Plaintiff and SPO Mitchell more harshly and negatively than any other \nofficers in the unit, and more harshly than other non-Black female officers, and used his authority \nand position to make things difficult and unpleasant for them.  \n28.  On or about May 2017 he assigned Plaintiff and SPO Mitchell vehicles that had been used \nby the K-9 unit and had been infested with fleas.  Plaintiff and SPO Mitchell used the vehicle for \na few days, but then notice’s the flea bites and resultant rashes, and asked Sgt. Boyd for different \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537   Document 1   Filed 06/07/21   Page 6 of 44\n \nvehicles.  Plaintiff asserts, and on information and belief, there were other vehicles available at the \ntime located on the top parking lot of SOD.   \n29.  Despite multiple requests, and having other options, Sgt. Boyd obstinately refused to assign \nPlaintiff and her partner different vehicles.  Sgt. Boyd’s recalcitrance with respect to Plaintiff’s \nrequest was disparate and unlike his response to requests from non-Black female officers and male \nofficers. \n30.  On or about June 2017, Plaintiff and SPO Mitchell went to the SOD Lieutenant, Kenny \nTaylor (Black male) (hereinafter “Lt. Taylor”), Sgt. Boyd’s superior, and complained about the \nfact that Sgt. Boyd refused to assign them a clean and un-infested vehicle.  Plaintiff at the time \nalleged that Sgt. Boyd targeted her and her partner for disparate treatment because they were \nAfrican American women, and that he treated similarly situated non-African American female \nofficers more favorably.  \n31.  To remedy their concerns, Lt. Taylor allowed them to use the ERT Suburban, a large and \ncomfortable vehicle.  \n32.  Plaintiff and SPO Mitchell were driving in the Suburban when they received an irate phone \ncall from Sgt. Boyd, demanding that they return the Suburban, despite the fact that his superior \nhad authorized Plaintiff and her partner to use the Suburban.  \n33.  From that point on, and for months thereafter, Sgt. Boyd undertook a campaign to retaliate \nagainst, undermine, isolate, spread false claims against and harass Plaintiff and SPO Mitchell. \nGiven his seniority and position of authority, Sgt. Boyd was able to effectively execute his scheme \nto retaliate against Plaintiff and SPO Mitchell because he saw them virtually every day and was in \nregular contact with their fellow officers.  \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537   Document 1   Filed 06/07/21   Page 7 of 44\n \n \nPLAINTIFF LOSES HER HUSBAND \n34.  On or about July 9, 2019, Plaintiff tragically and suddenly lost her husband and lifetime \npartner to an aneurysm.  \n35.  The loss was devastating to her, and she exhausted all of her accumulated sick and annual \nleave while on bereavement leave from the MPD.  \n36.  During her bereavement leave, Plaintiff suffered from anxiety and depression, and sought \nthe care of a medical professional and spiritual guidance to help manage her mental health \nchallenges.  \n37.  Plaintiff returned to work on or about September 23, 2019, but was still struggling with \ndepression,  and  sleeplessness.  She  did  seek  counseling  from  the  MPD-provided  counseling \nservice, as well as private counseling and medical care.  \n38.  On or about September 24, 2019, Plaintiff entered the roll call room for a major detail \nassignment.  At the time the room was full of officers in formal uniform.  This triggered thoughts \nof her late-husband and her grief overwhelmed her in that moment.  Her sobbing and emotional \npain caused her to hyperventilate, and struggle with breathing.   \n39.  An ambulance was called, and upon arriving, the paramedics took her vital signs.  By then, \nher breathing had improved, and SPO Mitchell offered to take Plaintiff home.  \n40.  Plaintiff returned to work a few days later.  When she did, SPO Mitchell and Officer \nTabatha Knight (Black female) (hereinafter “Officer Knight”), informed her superior, Lieutenant \nDarnell Robinson (hereinafter “Lt. Robinson”) had made derogatory comments about her extreme \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537   Document 1   Filed 06/07/21   Page 8 of 44\n \ngrief, had publicly denigrated her for exhibiting symptoms of depression and anxiety, and had \nthreatened to send Plaintiff for a fitness for duty evaluation.   \n41.  Plaintiff was shocked to hear and learn that her superior held her in such low esteem that \nhe would speak in a denigrating manner about her disability. Plaintiff further understood that Lt. \nRobinson had no concern for her, or her well-being, and that she needed to hide her symptoms or \nface retaliation or discrimination based on her disability.  Lt. Robinson’s comments made clear \nthat he disfavored Plaintiff as a result of her disability. \nTHE COLD TREATMENT \n42.  Plaintiff’s experiences with Sgt. Boyd marked the first time in her 26-year MPD career that \nshe was personally singled out for the systematic, orchestrated and intentional micro-aggressive \nretaliation that has become a cancer in the MPD that targets Black women officers, and particularly \nharms those who complain about the disparate and unfair treatment they endure.   \n 43.  For the purposes of this Complaint, the systematic, coordinated and intentional hostile \ntreatment of Black women officers by way of a pattern of hyper-scrutiny, disparate and over-harsh \ndiscipline, assignment to dangerous or undesirable tasks, denial of leave, denial of promotional \nand training opportunities, denigrating and attacking comments, unresponsiveness to complaints, \nand attacks on their reputations and ability to bond with their colleagues will be referred to as “The \nCold Treatment.” \n44.  “The Cold Treatment” is particularly pernicious because it slowly undermines the trust and \nconfidence that officers must have in each other to function well on the job.  Once an officer is \ntargeted for “The Cold Treatment,” every aspect of her work life becomes fraught with conflict \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537   Document 1   Filed 06/07/21   Page 9 of 44\n \nand constant marginalization to the point that the stress and unhappiness causes the officer to leave \nthe MPD voluntarily, if the orchestrated attacks fail to procure the targeted officer’s termination.  \n45.  An officer becomes the subject of “The Cold Treatment” when a leader or person of \ninfluence in the MPD decides that they want to be rid of her.  Black women officers are \ndisproportionately affected and targeted for “The Cold Treatment” by both their superiors and \nfellow officers. \n46.   When they seek help from MPD leadership or from the EEO office, “The Cold Treatment” \ncampaign against them escalates and intensifies. Not only are their complaints not taken seriously, \nbut the MPD EEO Director, Alphonso Lee (Black male) (hereinafter “Mr. Lee”), personally \nensures that their complaints are dismissed out of hand, and worse, that the allegations made get \nleaked to their fellow officers.   \n47.  Mr. Lee is a central figure in the harassment and retaliation suffered by Black women \nofficers who dare to complain about the treatment they endure because he has personally and \nspecifically directed his staff to invalidate complaints against the MPD leaders and officers he \nfavors.  Mr. Lee has determined for himself that those persons are “good leaders,” and therefore \nprotects them from any consequences for their frequent and unacceptable abuses of Black women \nofficers under their control. \n48.   Mr. Lee himself, or his staff, at his direction, has leaked confidential statements from Black \nwomen officers so frequently, and to such disastrous consequence to the complainants, that he has \neffectively chilled officers from raising concerns to the EEO office altogether.  \n49.  The damage Mr. Lee has done to Black women officers who have complained about \ndiscrimination cannot be overstated, nor can his negative and chilling impact on MPD.  \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537   Document 1   Filed 06/07/21   Page 10 of 44\n \nPLAINTIFF’S COMPLAINT REGARDING OFFENSIVE COMMENTS \n50.  On or about December 14, 2018, Plaintiff’s supervisor, Sgt. O’Bryant, left ERT SOD and \nwas reassigned to the Mayor’s detail.  Sgt. O’Bryant was known as a devout Christian, and very \nprofessional officer.  He ensured that people in his department adhered to a high level of decorum \nand respect for each other.  Upon his departure, the culture of ERT changed dramatically. \n51.  Sgt. O’Bryant was replaced by Sgt. John Brown (Black male) sometime in June of 2019, \nwho had a totally different leadership style.  Sgt. Brown was far more permissive and tolerant of \nunprofessional and inappropriate comments, most especially by male officers towards female \nofficers. \n52.   Upon the change in leadership, it became a common occurrence for officers in SOD to use \nfoul language and make inappropriate sexual comments.  Plaintiff had raised concerns about the \ndeclining professionalism of the unit to Sgt. Brown, but he ignored her concerns.   \n53.   SOD roll call is an official meeting of officers on their shifts to discuss assignments and \nshare information from previous shifts or other units.  Roll call is also an opportunity for \ndepartment  leaders  to  check-in  with  their  officers  and  receive  feed-back  and  give  daily \ninstructions, updates and important information.  \n54.  Roll call is also an opportunity for officers to see and engage with their colleagues.  \nBecause officers disperse during their shifts, roll call can be the only place where officers get to \nknow each other.  \n55.  On or about February 4, 2020, Plaintiff was the only female officer in a roll call meeting \nconducted by Sgt. Thomas Miller (White male) (hereinafter Sgt. Miller) and Sgt. Brown.  \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537   Document 1   Filed 06/07/21   Page 11 of 44\n \n56.  When Sgt. Brown told Officer Eric Harrison (White male) (hereinafter “Officer Harrison”) \nto work with another officer, Officer Harrison responded by shouting “he can suck my dick.” \nPlaintiff immediately looked up to the Sgts. in attendance, and heard several members laughing.  \nBut neither Sgt. Miller nor Sgt. Brown addressed the foul and inappropriate comment. \n57.  This was the one of the straws that broke the camel’s back for Plaintiff.  She got up from \nthe meeting and walked out, rather than confront again the unprofessionalism and obscenity of her \nco-worker.  \n58.  Plaintiff spoke to Sgt. Brown after the meeting, who admitted that the comment was \ninappropriate, but who refused to do anything to stop such comments and re-establish and enforce \nthe professionalism standards of the department.  \n59.  Plaintiff later texted Lt. Robinson to complain about the offensive language because she \nfelt the complaint would not be handled by Sgts. Miller and Brown.    \n60.  Lt. Robinson replied “until further notice he will show his presence in roll call, etc.”  \nHowever, he did not follow through with his assurances to Plaintiff, and did not attend roll \nthereafter. \n61.  Having received no action from Lt. Robinson to rectify a work environment that had \ndevolved into “lock-room talk” central, and that constantly made her, the only female in the room, \nuncomfortable, Plaintiff went to the MPD EEO office to complain.  \n62.    On or about February 5, 2020, Plaintiff was advised by Lt. Robinson to make a complaint \nto MPD EEO Mr. Lee, in which she was contacted to by EEO officer Doreen Haines (Black \nwoman) (hereinafter “Ms. Haines”) about Officer Harrison’s comment, and the fact that Sgt. \nBrown had permitted the comment to go without any action or redress. She further complained \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537   Document 1   Filed 06/07/21   Page 12 of 44\n \nthat Sgt. Brown was permitting her workplace to become a hyper-sexualized and obscenity-laden \nworkplace.  \n63.  During her interview with MPD EEO office, the Plaintiff did not believe that EEO \ninvestigator Ms. Ranae Lee (hereinafter “Ms. Lee”) had offered advice and guidance to Plaintiff \nor taken her concerns seriously.  All the EEO interviews were recorded.  \n64.   On information and belief, Ms. Lee played the recording for Mr. Alphonso Lee, her \nsupervisor in the EEO department.  Mr. Lee disciplined Ms. Lee for being “too helpful” to Plaintiff, \nand for giving any credence to Plaintiff’s complaint.  \n65.  On information and belief, Mr. Lee leaked to Sgt. Boyd that Plaintiff had complained about \nhim and the toxic work-environment he was fostering. \n66.  From that point on, Plaintiff became the target of a concerted, intentional and systematic \ncampaign to drum her out of the MPD.  In other words, Plaintiff became the target of “The Cold \nTreatment.” \nTHE CAMPAIGN TO RETALIATE AGAINST PLAINTIFF \n67.  According to EEO Counselor Harry Carter (Black male) (hereinafter “Mr. Carter”), who \nworked directly for Mr. Lee and was privy to Mr. Lee’s comments about Plaintiff, Mr. Lee told \nMs. Doreen Haines and Ms. Ranae Lee before an investigation had been conducted regarding \nPlaintiff’s complaint, as well as complaints from several other Black female officers, that “MPD \nwould be better off if they figured out how to fire officers like [Plaintiff], Officer Karen Carr \n(Black  female),  and  Officer  Tabatha  Knight  (Black  female)  because  all  they  did  was  file \ncomplaints.” \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537   Document 1   Filed 06/07/21   Page 13 of 44\n \n68.  In short, EEO Director Lee made a decision that the MPD would benefit from moving out \nPlaintiff and some of the other Black female officers with similar complaints, and initiated a \ncampaign in MPD to achieve that goal.  \n69.  Plaintiff became alarmed at the retaliation and discrimination that was taking place at the \nMPD and wrote to Mayor Muriel Bowser to report what was going on.  Plaintiff received a \nresponse from the Mayoral office on or about March 26, 2020. \n70.  On or about March 25, 2020, there was a scheduled meeting with Lt. Robinson, Sgt.  \nBrown, Plaintiff’s partner SPO Mitchell and Plaintiff. When Plaintiff asked about the status of her \ncomplaint, Lt. Robinson became hostile, dismissing her concerns and simply stating that such \ninvestigations “take time.” \n71.  Even more troubling to Plaintiff, towards the end of the meeting, Lt. Robinson indicated \nthat he would be separating Plaintiff and her long-time partner SPO Mitchell, because there were \n“red flags,” with regards to them and that “they were being watched” and seen transferring bags \nfrom one car to another.  Lt. Robinson further stated that Plaintiff and SPO Mitchell needed to \n“watch the company they kept.”   \n72.  Plaintiff interpreted these statements as both a warning and a threat, and as thinly veiled \nretaliation for her reporting her concerns of discrimination and retaliation to the Mayor’s Office.  \nLt. Robinson was telegraphing to her that her concerns were unimportant, and also that in raising \nher concerns, she was becoming the subject of scrutiny and a target for retaliation. \n73.  Lt. Robinson decision to separate Plaintiff from her long-time partner was, and was meant \nto be, punitive.  Both Plaintiff and SPO Mitchell felt the move to separate them was punitive in \nnature, and very destabilizing and unsettling to their work life.  \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537   Document 1   Filed 06/07/21   Page 14 of 44\n \n74.  Worse still, around the time of the meeting, Lt. Robinson chose to discipline Plaintiff for \narriving at work too early, something that in all her years in the MPD, Plaintiff had never seen \nanother officer disciplined for.  \n75.  On or about April 9, 2020, Plaintiff went on sick leave due to exposure to the coronavirus \nbecause she had been around SPO Mitchell, who had tested positive for the virus.  Plaintiff went \non leave per Center for Disease Control (hereinafter “CDC”) protocols.  However, when she was \ntested, she came up negative, so she returned to work prior to completing the full 14-day quarantine \nperiod.  \n76.  On or about April 21, 2020, Plaintiff elected to file a District of Columbia Office of Human \nRights complaint, alleging discrimination and retaliation and seeking redress for her concerns \nabout the treatment of Black Women Officers in the MPD. \n77.  According to CDC guidelines, the entrance and exit of the SOD building was limited to \none door, so that persons entering could have their temperatures taken, and answer health questions \nto assess their risk.   \n78.  From June 5, 2020, to June 12, 2020, the officials of SOD ERT failed to post someone at \nthe door to conduct the health assessments.  So, when Plaintiff arrived at work, she looked around, \nand then entered the building.  Obviously, several other officers did the same thing.  \n79.  On or about June 9, 2020, Plaintiff notified Sgt. Brown about the fact that there was no one \nconducting health screening assessments at the SOD entrance, to which Sgt. Brown unhelpfully \nresponded that he was “drawing a blank.” Plaintiff raised the issue because she had already been \nexposed to COVID-19 at work and lived through the anxiety of waiting for a test result, which \nexacerbated her anxiety condition. She had no desire to repeat the experience.  \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537   Document 1   Filed 06/07/21   Page 15 of 44\n \n80.  On June 16, 2020, Plaintiff reasserted her concerns about the fact that the CDC-mandated \nhealth assessments were not being conducted because there was no one stationed at the entrance \nto do them.  She spoke with Sgt. Brown, who told her to speak to Lt. Robinson. \n81.  The same day, Plaintiff reached out to Lt. Robinson, who answered her concern with a one-\nword response: “noted.” \n82.  Subsequently Lt. Robinson sent Plaintiff an email about her duties for an upcoming detail, \nbut made no mention of the mandatory health assessment, or her legitimate concerns regarding the \nfact that they were not being conducted.  \n83.  On June 17, 2020, Sgt. Miller raised to SPO Mitchell that “someone complained” about \nthe health assessments not being done, thus letting SPO Mitchell know that the leadership was \nannoyed with Plaintiff’s persistent complaints about the issue.   \n84.  When Plaintiff arrived at work that day, a tactical officer on limited duty stationed at the \ndoor took her temperature but did not ask the health assessment questions.  \n85.  On June 19, 2020, when Plaintiff reported for duty, again there was no one at the SOD \nentrance to conduct the assessment.  Plaintiff entered the building and went to the negotiator’s \noffice, where Sgt. Brown, took her temperature.  \n86.  Again, Sgt. Brown, and the rest of the leadership team failed to take Plaintiff’s concerns \nseriously and made her feel like a pariah for raising the issue. This compounded her stress and \nanxiety about entering a workplace that was clearly not abiding by CDC-guidelines.     \n87.  On or about July 10, 2020, Plaintiff was shocked to receive an email from Captain Michelle \nCaron (White female) (hereinafter “Capt. Caron”), that was curt and aggressive, demanding that \nPlaintiff provide an explanation as to why she had not submitted a written statement regarding an \nincident she had witnessed between Sgt. Boyd and Officer Carr.  \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537   Document 1   Filed 06/07/21   Page 16 of 44\n \n88.  In fact, Plaintiff was not evading Captain Caron’s request, but was simply on leave during \nthe time of her request.  Had Captain Caron simply inquired, rather than sending Plaintiff a sharp-\nedged and accusatory email, the Captain would have discovered that Plaintiff was not being \nevasive.  Again, this incident was part of a pattern in which Plaintiff was treated with suspicion \nand disregard.  \n89.  Three days after receiving Captain Caron’s unnecessarily accusatory email, Plaintiff was \ncalled in to Internal Affairs Department (hereinafter “IAD”) to answer to a charge that she had \nmissed a health assessment in roll call.   \n90.  This was precisely the issue that Plaintiff not only raised to her leadership, but was \npersistently ignored about.  When she pointed out that there was no one stationed at the designated \nentrance, IAD informed Plaintiff that she should have “gone in and looked” for an official.  \nPlaintiff responded that there was no one to find on that particular date.  \n91.  This episode of intimidation and retaliation was particularly stunning to Plaintiff, because \nof her efforts to address the issue of health assessments at the entrances, and was ignored by her \nchain of command.  But rather than simply dismissing the claim, IAD kept the case open and \nrefused to clear Plaintiff of the allegation. \n92.  As mentioned above, MPD EEO and IAD were blithely leaking and sharing information \nfrom confidential interviews with rank-and-file officers, which spread like wildfire through the \ndepartment. This was a concerted effort by EEO Director Lee and others to sow distrust and anger \nin the department, and to isolate and intimidate Plaintiff. \n93.  Thus, at the roll call that took place on or about July 17, 2020, Officer Anthony Campanale \n(White male) (hereinafter “Officer Campanale”) shouted at Plaintiff asking if she was recording \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537   Document 1   Filed 06/07/21   Page 17 of 44\n \nthe roll call.  Plaintiff took immediate offense at his volatile and physically aggressive stance and \ntone, and asked Officer Campanale “who are you talking to?”   \n94.  Officer Campanale continued to aggressively question and move into Plaintiff’s personal \nspace and had to be restrained by other officers in the room.  Officer Campanale was so aggressive, \nthat he made Plaintiff fear for her personal safety.   \n95.  Sgt. Luke Foskett was conducting the roll call.  When Plaintiff asked him if he was going \nto do anything about Officer Campanale aggressively charging her, Sgt. Foskett asked Plaintiff: \n“well are you recording?”   \n96.  The Sgt.’s response was so offensive, and so inappropriate, that Plaintiff simply walked \nout of the roll call, shaking with anger and anxiety. \n97.  Plaintiff immediately notified her union representatives Hiram Rosario and Officer Knight, \nwho notified the chain of command.  \n98.   On or about July 22, 2020, Plaintiff met with EEO Director Lee and complained about the \nretaliation from members of the SOD unit.  Mr. Lee informed Plaintiff that she could file an EEOC \ncharge, which was his way of communicating that his department would not be investigating her \nclaims. \n99.      As part of his ongoing campaign of petty attacks, on or about August 14, 2020, Sgt. Boyd \nordered Plaintiff to put her cell phone away at roll call, even though he kept both of his cell phones \nvisible on the table in front of him, and he allowed other male tactical officers to keep their cell \nphones out and visible.  Plaintiff could not help but feel embarrassed and singled out as the only \nfemale officer in the roll call, targeted for blatantly disparate application of the rules.  \n100.  On or about August 16, 2020, Plaintiff was off work when the ERT unit issued a policy \nchange requiring officers to wear their ballistic vests at roll call.  Because Plaintiff was off that \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537   Document 1   Filed 06/07/21   Page 18 of 44\n \nday, she was not informed of the policy change, but all the other tactical officers were aware of \nthe change. \n101.  On or about August 18, 2020, on Plaintiff’s first shift after her day off, Sgt. Boyd publicly \nembarrassed and singled out Plaintiff in the roll call meeting for not wearing her protective vest, \neven though he knew she was off when the policy change occurred, and that he, as her supervisor, \nfailed to give her a heads’ up about the new rule.  Sgt. Brown used this innocuous and unintentional \noversight as a basis to further humiliate Plaintiff, and belittle her in front of her colleagues.  \n102.     On or about August 27, 2020, Plaintiff was summoned to IAD again, to receive a \ndisciplinary charge related to the incident with Officer Campanale.  Although Officer Campanale \nphysically charged and threatened Plaintiff, and had to be physically restrained from harming her, \nthe  Department  decided  to  punish  Plaintiff  for  “raising  her  tone,”  which  they  deemed \ninappropriate. Plaintiff was charged with conduct unbecoming an officer, and no discipline, at that \ntime, was given to Officer Campanale. \n103.  On or about September 1, 2020, Plaintiff was disciplined for missing a call out on a \nbarricade.  Not only was she the first officer in the history of ERT to be disciplined for that, but to \nadd insult to injury, the Department went back in time to add the call-out she missed on Mother’s \nDay in May.  In other words, the Department leadership manufactured something to discipline \nPlaintiff for, and then went looking for a way to increase the severity of the punishment.  \n104.  On September 8, 2020, Capt. Caron asked Plaintiff to write yet another statement regarding \nthe incident involving Sgt. Boyd’s disrespectful and rude behavior towards Officer Carr, who is \nalso an African American female officer.  Capt. Caron asked specific questions in her request to \nPlaintiff designed to entrap Plaintiff into making contradictory statements.  Plaintiff, however, did \nnot modify her original statement.  \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537   Document 1   Filed 06/07/21   Page 19 of 44\n \n105.  On or about September 10, 2020, Plaintiff entered the SOD building to begin her shift, but \nfound no one stationed there to take temperatures and conduct health assessments. Again, this was \na management failure and oversight that was used as an excuse to discipline Plaintiff a few months \nprior, despite the fact that she had no authority to ensure that MPD adhered to CDC guidelines. \n106.  The lack of consistent manning of the SOD entrance with someone to conduct health \nassessments  and  take  temperatures  is  evidence  that  the  Department  was  not  serious  about \nprotecting the health of its officers (which explains why Plaintiff was twice exposed to COVID-\n19 from her co-workers) but was instead only serious about manufacturing phony violations for \nwhich to discipline Plaintiff.  \n107.  On October 29, 2020, Plaintiff was given an assignment by Sgt. Boyd.  All the other \npersonnel with a similar assignment were relieved, but Plaintiff was not.  Plaintiff had to call in to \nremind Sgt. Brown that she needed to be relieved.  Again, Plaintiff had to work longer than her \ncolleagues, and had to ask for the courtesy and concern that was automatically given to her male \ncounterparts.  \n108.  On October 31, 2020, Plaintiff sent an email to Chief of Police Peter Newsham (White \nmale)  (hereinafter  “Chief  Newsham”)  and  Assistant  Chief  Jeffery  Carroll  (White  male) \n(hereinafter “Asst. Chief Carroll”) and others in the chain of command to complain and inform of \nthe systemic and sustained disparate treatment and discriminatory actions against Black female \nofficers in the MPD. \n109.  On or about November 3, 2020, Sgt. Brown allowed tactical members to come in before \ntheir scheduled duty and gave them assignments without disciplining them.  This stands in sharp \ncontrast to the discipline Plaintiff received for coming in early for one single shift, and is further \nevidence of disparate treatment.  \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537   Document 1   Filed 06/07/21   Page 20 of 44\n \n110.  Sgt. Brown did not conduct a roll call that day, nor a health assessment, but he did give \nPlaintiff an assignment for ballot box detail, which she executed.  Plaintiff was shocked to be later \nwritten up for not attending the roll call or health assessment, that Sgt. Brown failed to hold or \nprovide.   \n111.  This disciplinary write up was yet another example of breathtakingly unfair discipline, \nbased on pretext and false evidence, was designed to demoralize and break down Plaintiff’s will.  \n112.  On or about November 10, 2020, Plaintiff received her job performance documentation.  \nIn it she found several supposed “violations” that were basically trumped-up, fabricated, unjust, \ndisparate or exaggerated charges, that formulated a basis for the Department to terminate her \nemployment. \n113.  On or about November 24, 2020, Plaintiff was exposed a second time to COVID-19, this \ntime from one of the tactical officers who had tested positive, and therefore went back into \nquarantine until her test results were returned.   \n114.  That day, Plaintiff received a telephone call from her union representative Officer Rosario \nadvising her that IAD was moving forward with the “conduct unbecoming” charge against her for \nthe incident with Officer Campanale.   \n115.  When Plaintiff returned to work, she was told to report to IAD to sign paperwork related \nto the discipline over the Officer Campanale incident.  Plaintiff strongly disagreed with the \ndisciplinary finding but signed the document anyway, noting on the document that she was signing \nunder duress, in order to be left alone. \n116.  In  the  normal  course  of  business,  Plaintiff  would  have  received  her  performance \nevaluation, and any notice of deficiencies, in order for her to have an opportunity to improve on \nthose deficiencies.   \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537   Document 1   Filed 06/07/21   Page 21 of 44\n \n117.  However, in her case, Plaintiff had to ask Sgt. Brown for her performance evaluation, and \nshe was never given a list of deficiencies, or time to fix them.  Instead, she was given a very low \nperformance evaluation based almost entirely on minor disciplinary matters that were either \nfabricated, disproportionate, disparate or unfair.  \n118.  Plaintiff, therefore asked for a meeting to discuss her concerns about her performance \nevaluation and to explore how she could engage with management about her concerns with the \nway she was being treated. \n119.  During Plaintiff’s shift on or about December 8, 2020, while Plaintiff was talking on the \nphone with her union representative, Sgt. Brown approached Plaintiff to direct her to go to the roll \ncall room for the performance evaluation meeting she had asked for.   \n120.  Rather than allowing Plaintiff to finish her call, Sgt. Brown rudely and loudly interrupted \nher, and gave her the directive about the meeting in a condescending, hostile and disrespectful \nmanner.  \n121.  Plaintiff had asked her union representative to hold while she spoke with Sgt. Brown, but \nbecause Sgt. Brown was speaking so loudly and aggressively, Officer Knight, the representative, \nwas able to hear the entire exchange.   \n122.  Officer Knight took note and was dismayed at the disrespectful and hostile tone that Sgt. \nBrown used to convey a simple directive.  \n123.  Plaintiff went to the meeting as directed but asked for, and received, representation from \nher union representative Officer Knight at the meeting.  \n124.  Once Plaintiff arrived at the performance evaluation meeting, she found Sgt. Brown and \none other Sgt. from a different department, whom Plaintiff did not know or recognize.   \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537   Document 1   Filed 06/07/21   Page 22 of 44\n \n125.  Officer Knight, in her role as union representative, insisted that the performance evaluation \nmeeting only be attended by SOD managers.  Thus, the non-SOD Sgt. who was initially there, left \nthe  meeting  and  was  replaced  Sgt.  Jane  Barrientos  (Hispanic  female)  (hereinafter  “Sgt. \nBarrientos”).  \n126.  At  the  meeting,  Officer  Knight  questioned  and  challenged  Sgt.  Brown  about  the \ndisciplinary  matters  in  the  evaluation,  but  Sgt.  Brown  refused  to  make  any  substantial  or \nmeaningful changes to  the evaluation.   Plaintiff then formally appealed the content of her \nperformance evaluation.  \n127.  On or about December 9, 2020, while on shift, Plaintiff started experiencing anxiety and \nmigraine headache symptoms related to the stress of what had happened in her performance \nevaluation meeting.  She notified Sgt. Miller of her worsening condition and asked to go to the \nPolice and Fire clinic for assistance.  \nPLAINTIFF’S ENGAGEMENT IN PROTECTED ACTIVITY \n128.  On or about December 23, 2020, Plaintiff filed a formal charge with the EEOC, alleging \nrace, age, gender and disability discrimination, and retaliation, and disparate treatment.  \n129.  After seeing the clinic’s psychologist and speaking with the clinic’s Physician Assistant \nTasha Williams, Plaintiff was placed on sick leave to mitigate her anxiety symptoms, until \nDecember 31, 2020.  \n130.  While on sick leave, Plaintiff was notified on or about December 12, 2020, that Sgt. Brown \nhad tested positive for COVID-19, and that she would have to be tested again for having been \nexposed for the third time, to a co-worker who had tested positive.     \n131.  Plaintiff reported to the Police and Fire Clinic for testing, and luckily tested negative.  \nHowever, the inconvenience and anxiety related to this third potential exposure, in conjunction \n22 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537   Document 1   Filed 06/07/21   Page 23 of 44\n \nwith the fact that her concerns and inquiries about non-compliance with coronavirus protocols by \nSOD management went unaddressed, caused Plaintiff to experience even more frustration with her \nsituation.  \n132.  Despite her union representative’s efforts to address the inaccurate and unfair disciplinary \nactions in Plaintiff’s evaluation, SOD management was unwilling to modify the assessment. \nTherefore, on or about January 9, 2021, Plaintiff wrote to MPD Assistant Chief Carroll and several \ncity council members regarding the disparate treatment, racial inequality, retaliatory behavior, \nharassment and criminal actions of the IAD.   \n133.  The Assistant Chief replied on January 11, 2021, denying that any discriminatory practices \nexisted in SOD, and referred Plaintiff back to EEO for investigations of her concerns.  His response \nwas a slap in the face to Plaintiff, inasmuch as she had complained of the fact that EEO was \nsystematically ignoring and dismissing claims from Black female officers.  \n134.

The Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq., prohibits employers from \ndiscriminating against qualified individuals because of a disability “in regard to job application \nprocedures, the hiring, advancement or discharge of employees, employment compensation, job \ntraining, and other terms, conditions, and privileges of employment.” 42 U.S.C. § 12112. \n258.  Plaintiff’s disability substantially limited at least one of Plaintiff’s major life activities, \nsleeping.  Plaintiff is an individual with a disability under the ADA. \n259.  On  several  occasions,  as  described  above,  Defendant  asked  Plaintiff  inappropriate \nquestions about her disability, and commented about her disability to her colleagues and co-\nworkers.  \n260.  On one occasion, as a result of having an episode related to depression and anxiety, \nPlaintiff’s supervisor made negative comments about her to her colleagues and threatened to send \n39 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537   Document 1   Filed 06/07/21   Page 40 of 44\n \nher for a fitness for duty evaluation, which was intended to be, and was a threat to her future \nemployment and a reprisal for her suffering from a disability.  \n261.  When  Plaintiff  complained  about  her  serious  and  legitimate  concerns  regarding  her \nDepartment’s failure to comply with CDC guidelines regarding personnel entering the SOD \nbuilding, she was ignored or humiliated for raising the issue.  Later, management disciplined her \nfor not obtaining a health assessment upon entering the building, when it was her management that \nfailed to station a person at the entrance to conduct the assessment. \n262.  Defendant’s actions were intended to mock Plaintiff for suffering from anxiety, and to add \nto exasperate her condition by forcing her to be even more worried for her health due to potential \nexposure to COVI-19. \n263.  On  three  occasions,  as  described  above,  Plaintiff  was  exposed  to  COVID-19  from \ncolleagues who had tested positive and was forced to quarantine as a result.  Each such instance \nwas the result of Defendant’s lackadaisical attitude to compliance with CDC COVID-19 protocols. \n264.  On at least two occasions, personal and confidential information about Plaintiff’s mental \nhealth condition and disability was discussed or leaked to her colleagues by her supervisors, \ncausing Plaintiff’s co-workers to not want to work with her, and shaming Plaintiff and creating a \nstigma related to her disability. \n265.  Defendant’s actions constituted disparate and discriminatory treatment that caused Plaintiff \nto suffer and punished her for having a disability. \n266.  Plaintiff was humiliated, embarrassed and made to endure constant stress and anxiety, \ndepression, lack of sleep and other symptoms that required her to seek professional treatment, and \nthat materially caused her severe mental anguish.   \n40 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01537   Document 1   Filed 06/07/21   Page 41 of 44\n \n267.  Plaintiff has incurred lost wages, loss of reputation and loss of career opportunity now and \ninto the future, and all the other losses stated herein. \n268.  Plaintiff herein seeks compensatory and punitive money damages, and damages for mental \npain and suffering of not less than $250,000, plus interest, costs, fees and all other remedies the \nCourt deems appropriate. \n \nClaims Under the District of Columbia  \nWhistleblower Protection Act \nD.C.
