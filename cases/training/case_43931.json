Defendants move to preclude the report and testimony of Plaintiff's expert, Dr. Donna Lopiano, before her deposition on relevance and reliability grounds.

Rather, Defendants argue that Dr. Lopiano's opinions should be excluded under Federal Rules of Evidence 403, 701, and 702. In support of their motion, Defendants submit an incomplete version of Dr. Lopiano's draft report (e.g., referring to but not including exhibit MM), but not the report in its entirety.

          "description": "ORDER granting in part and denying in part 129 Motion for Conference. Because of his previous experience, and knowledge of this case, and because it had been previously referred to him, the Court referred this matter to the Honorable Judge William I. Garfinkel, a U.S. Magistrate Judge on recall. Judge Garfinkel has had a distinguished career, and is a renowned mediator of legal matters of all kinds, and this Court has no doubt that this case, in its new posture, could benefit from his considerable expertise once again. As a result, at least in this instance, the parties' suggestion of \"a fresh set of eyes [as] more likely to be conducive to a productive, constructive, and ultimately successful settlement conference,\" Motion to Refer at 1, ECF No. 129, is misguided, at best. Nevertheless, because the Court will not waste Judge Garfinkel's precious time, as a recalled Magistrate Judge, with parties who have unnecessarily prejudged him, although the Court has no doubt Judge Garfinkel has not and would not prejudge them, the Court will grant the motion for a referral. But, because the District of Connecticut no longer has a system of pairing judges by courthouse location, this matter will be placed in the wheel for a new assignment. Signed by Judge Victor A. Bolden on 3/18/2023. (Bartlett, H) (Entered: 03/18/2023)"

Because the parties will likely be ordered to attend the conference, either in-person or via videoconference, counsel are instructed to obtain their client's schedules over the next ninety days and have them available during the pre-conference. Counsel should also have their own calendars available to aid in scheduling. During the telephone call, counsel should be prepared to discuss what, if any, information needs to be exchanged and anything else that needs to be accomplished prior to the settlement conference to maximize its chances of success.If either counsel has a firm, unavoidable conflict at the appointed date and time, e.g., a previously-scheduled appearance in another court, s/he should not file a motion for continuance on the docket but rather should call Chambers at 860-240-3605 as soon as possible with opposing counsel on the line to work out an alternate day and time for the pre-conference with Judge Farrish's law clerk.

    "summary": "<p>On December 19, 2016, a female student at the University of Connecticut brought this action in the U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut against the University of Connecticut (&ldquo;UConn&rdquo;) Board of Trustees and three of the university&rsquo;s employees. This lawsuit arose from the student&rsquo;s removal from the women&rsquo;s soccer team and the termination of her one-year athletic scholarship following a hand gesture made during celebrations on the soccer field after victory that was broadcast on television and online. The individual student plaintiff filed lawsuit pro se but was represented by private counsel shortly thereafter and alleged violations of the First and Fourteenth Amendments; Title IX; and state law contract and tort claims. Plaintiff sought declaratory relief as well as compensatory and punitive damages.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On June 5, 2017, defendants moved to partially dismiss the complaint. On December 14, 2017, the court granted in part and denied in part the defendants&rsquo; motion to dismiss. The court reasoned that only the Title IX claim could proceed against the Board of Trustees because all &sect;1983 claims against the Board were alleged in their official capacity, which was not workable because the Board was not a \"person\" in the statute's contemplation. The court also determined that the plaintiff&rsquo;s constitutional and state law claims could proceed against the three university employees but only as to their individual capacities.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>After discovery and failed settlement talks, the defendants moved for summary judgment on November 1, 2019. On December 23, 2019, the plaintiff filed a cross-motion for partial summary judgment on her constitutional claims. On June 6, 2020, judge granted the defendants&rsquo; motion for summary judgment on all remaining claims and denied plaintiff&rsquo;s motion for summary judgement. Regarding the plaintiff&rsquo;s Title IX claim, the court reasoned that the defendants had established a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for termination. The court additionally held that the plaintiff did not show sufficient personal involvement by the university employees for her equal protection claim or that her scholarship was a constitutionally protected property interest for her due process claim. As to the plaintiff&rsquo;s free speech claim, the court recognized that her gesture was protected speech but that the defendants were entitled to qualified immunity. Finally, the court noted that the plaintiff had conceded that her state law claims lacked merit. 65 F. Supp. 3d 75.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiff appealed part of the district court&rsquo;s decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit on July 3, 2020. Specifically, the plaintiff appealed the district court&rsquo;s grant of summary judgment as to her due process, free speech, and Title IX claims. The appellate court affirmed the district court&rsquo;s decision regarding the free speech claim. As for the procedural due process claim, the appellate court disagreed with the district court and held that her scholarship was a constitutionally protected property interest, but the Second Circuit then found that the defendants enjoyed qualified immunity as to this claim.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Lastly, the appellate court disagreed with the district court&rsquo;s decision to grant summary judgment in favor of the university on the Title IX claim. The appellate court found that, taking the evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, a rational jury could find that her gender played a role in the termination of her scholarship. Specifically, the plaintiff provided proof of more preferable treatment of male students after misconduct as well as the inconsistent reasons for termination of plaintiff&rsquo;s scholarship by UConn officials. 55 F.4th 101. The case was remanded to the district court. As of February 17, 2023, this case in ongoing.&nbsp;</p>",

On or about August 7,2014, the Plaintiff, then 18 years old, enrolled as a full-time\nstudent and a member of the women's varsity soccer team at Defendant UConn.\n9.  At all times mentioned in this Complaint, Defendant UConn was a member\ninstitution of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (\"NCAA\"), competing in Division I\nathletics (\"DI\").\n3\n\nCase 3:16-cv-02091-VAB   Document 1   Filed 12/19/16   Page 4 of 35\n10.  At all times mentioned in this Complaint, Defendant UConn competed in women's\nvarsity soccer as a member of the American Athletic Conference ('AAC\")'\n1 1.  Prior to enrolling at Defendant UConn, on or about February 5,2014, by letter from\nDefendant Lucas (Exhibit A), the Plaintiff was offered a \"Full Out-of-State Grant-in-Aid\"\nconditional athletics scholarship (\"Scholarship\").\n12. \nAccompanying the Scholarship offer letter were two pertinent interrelated documents\nalready signed by Defendant Lucas on February 5,2014:\na.  the voluntary \"National Letter of Intent,\" providing a good-faith commitment to\nattend a member institution of the NCAA (Exhibit B), showing the Plaintiffs\n\"Prospective Student-Athlete's NCAA ID\" as \" 1307378362,\" signed on February 10,\n2014 by the Plaintiff and her father, Khaled Radwan, and returned to Defendant\nLucas with the Contract; and\nb.  rhe \"UNfVERSITY  OF CONNECTICUT Division of Athletics ATHLETICS\nFINANCIALAID AGREEMENT 2014-2015\" (\"Conffact\") (Exhibit C); the Contract\nwas signed by the Plaintiff and her father on February 10, 2014, and sometime\nthereafter it was \"Reviewed\" and signed by the UConn women's varsity soccer head\ncoach, Defendant Tsantiris.\n13.  The bilateral written Contract between the Plaintiff and Defendant UConn for the\nScholarship was entered on or about February 10,2014, to be performed effectively in Connecticut\nsubject to the respective rules and bylaws applicable to a sfudent-athlete and other separate rules\napplicable to all students of Defendant UConn, as provided under Defendant UConn's agreements\n4\n\nCase 3:16-cv-02091-VAB   Document 1   Filed 12/19/16   Page 5 of 35\nwith the NCAA and AAC,'\\ /e well as under UConn's Cocle of Conduct applicable to all students of\nDefendant UConn.\n14.  On November 9, 2014, Defendant UConn's women's soccer team played the\nUniversity of South Florida (\"USF\") in Tampa, Florida, for the AAC conference championship and\nautomatic NCAA DI championship toumament seeding when, in excitement and celebration of\ndefeating USF by penalty kicks in overtime, having become apaft of her first championship team,\nthe Plaintiff inadvertently  in celebration showed her middle finger to an ESPNIJ camera, which\nbroadcasted it live along with its Internet steaming affiliate, V/atch ESPN, creating an unintended\nimmediate social media and lnternet topic for comments (\"the Incident\").\n15. \nAfter the game and the lncident, and before returning to the locker room, Defendant\nTsantiris pulled Plaintiff aside and confronted her with a picfure of the Incident, presumably from\nthe Internet. Plaintiff tried to apologize and explain her conduct, and despite Defendant Tsantiris\nacknowledging to the Plaintiff that he had no problems with the Plaintiffs attitude and that he knew\nshe did not mean it, and that it was, as he said a \"silly mistake,\" because it was all over the Internet\nand television, Defendant Tsantiris said he unfortunately had to punish her by suspending the\nPlaintiff from all team activities effective immediately, removing her entirely from playing at all in\nthe NCAA Championship Tournament no matter how far the team went.\n16.  Defendant Tsantiris then issued a press release (Exhibit D). It was disseminated\nthrough the Associated Press (Exhibit E), indicating an \"obscene gesture\" was used for \"celebrating\nwith teammates.\" There was no discussion with any of the coaches about the Incident before leaving\nTampa, and no truly negative comments about the Incident were received by the Plaintiff from USF\nor any players.\n5\n\nCase 3:16-cv-02091-VAB   Document 1   Filed 12/19/16   Page 6 of 35\n17. \nOn Monday, November 10, 2014, the Plaintiff wrote a letter to Assistant Coach\nMargaret \"Mags\" Rodriguez (Exhibit F), apologizingfor the Incident and providing much of what\nshe could not express to Defendant Tsantiris, who did not want to listen to her reasons when\nsuspending her after the USF game in Tampa. She received no response to that letter.\n18.  At all times mentioned in this Complaint, the conduct of a student-athlete at\nDefendant UConn was governed by the rules and by-laws of the NCAA, ACC, and University of\nConnecticut2013-20I4  Student-Athlete  Handbook (\"Handbook\"), which was also applicable to the\nI 2014-2015 academic year (Exhibit G).\n19. \nAt sometime early in th e201,4-2015 women's soccer season, Defendant Tsantiris had\nall women soccer players sign an agreement or \"pact\" of some kind. The agreement or \"pact\" was\npursuant to the Handbook, which stated that for each athletic team at Defendant UConn, the \"coach\nif\nhas his/her o\\iln very specific team rules covering everything from conduct to dress code. Again, \nyour coach has written team rules, you may wish to keep them in the back of this Handbook.\"\n(Exhibit G,at4.)\n20. \nDefendant Tsantiris did not provide a copy of the signed \"pact\" or written team rules\nto Plaintiff, and upon information and belief, none of the other team players were provided with a\ncopy.\n21. \nOn October 19,2015, Plaintiffs New York attorney, Gregory J. Tarone, Esquire\n(\"Tarone\"), made a Freedom of Information Law (\"FOIL\") request pursuant to the Connecticut\nFreedom of Information Act(\"CFOIA\"), C.G.S. 00 1-200 etseq.,upon DefendantUConn's  Division\nof Athletics for \"an opportunity to inspect or obtain copies of public records regarding rules\n6\n\nCase 3:16-cv-02091-VAB   Document 1   Filed 12/19/16   Page 7 of 35\ngoveming player conduct of all NCAA Division I sports teams at the University of Connecticut,\nexcept for men's basketball.\"\n22.  ln response to Tarone's October 19,2015 FOIL, UConn offered a detailed Affidavit\nbyDeputyDirector of Athletics/Chief of StaffPaul McCarthy (Exhibit H), dated February 16,2076,\nwhich listed in par agraph 12 all NCAA Division teams that currently had no written rules, as advised\nby Defendant Tsantiris.\n. \n23  Plaintiffbelieves  that the \"pact\" she signed with other women's soccer team members\namounted to \"team rules\" because she recalls it was a commitment that had to do with conduct and\nresponsibilities, and Defendant Tsantiris had an obligation according to the Handbook to provide\neach team member with a copy of that \"pact.\"\n24.  If the \"pact\" can be properly considered \"team rules,\" then Defendant Tsantiris\nviolated the CFOIA and is subject to its enforcement. With respect to \"team rules\" addressed supra\ninparagraph \"18\" (Exhibit G,at4),DefendantTsantiris didnotrevealthe \"pact\" as arecordthatwas\nrequested by Tarone under the FOIL, thereby violating the CFOIA and subjecting himself to its\nenforcement.\n25.  The Handbook indicates that \"[t]he head coach will meet with the student-athlete at\nthe first sign ofnon-compliance  of team rules to clearly delineate the responsibilities of the student-\nathlete to correct the reasons given by the coach as substandard. The head coach will memo the sport\nadministrator of this occurrence.\" (Exhibit G, at 15.)\n26.  No such memo as required by the Handbook is known to ever have been issued by\nDefendant Tsantiris, or shown to the Plaintiff, or provided to the sport administrator, as required.\n,7\n\nCase 3:16-cv-02091-VAB   Document 1   Filed 12/19/16   Page 8 of 35\nDefendant Tsantiris therefore violated the Handbook rules and should be held properly accountable\nby Defendant UConn.\n27.  A couple of days after returning from Tampa and being suspended, the Plaintiff\nvisited Defendant Manuel in his office and asked him if she was going to lose Scholarship over the\nIncident, and he said: \"I have no intention of pulling your scholarship over this.\"\n28.  To address the Incident with the women's soccer coaches, the Plaintiff then hand-\ndelivered a letter to each of the three coaches, undated but provided on or about November 18, 2014\n;\n(Exhibit I), apologizing and explaining her conduct. None of the coaches acknowledged the\nPlaintiffs letter, replied to it, or discussed it with her.\n29 .  On Decemb er 5 ,2014,nearly a month after the Incident, the Plaintiff sent a follow-up\nemail to equipment manager Megan Hostillo (Exhibit J), indicating her cleat size for a specific shoe\ntype she that had not indicated in her December 3,2014 email. This shows by behavior the\npreparation for Plaintiffs being on the roster for the 2015-2016 season. There was no indication her\nScholarship would not be renewed in May.\n30.  ln the evening of Sunday, December 19,2014,the Plaintiff received a telephone call\nfrom Defendant Tsantiris notifying her that he was canceling her Scholarship because ofthe Incident.\n31.  Soon thereafter in the evening of December 2I,2014, the Plaintiff wrote directly to\nDefendant Manuel (Exhibit K), pleading with him in the misguided belief that is was Defendant\nTsantiris's decision alone and not Defendant Manuel's to either approve or deny Defendant Tsantiris's\ndecision to cancel a scholarship mid-year, because Defendant Tsantiris had told the Plaintiff that it\nwas his decision alone to cancel Scholarship, and not Defendant Manuel's. Though on clear and\ncomplete notice of the wrongful conduct of Defendant Tsantiris under the NCAA By-Laws,\n8\n\nCase 3:16-cv-02091-VAB   Document 1   Filed 12/19/16   Page 9 of 35\nDefendantManuel failed to intervene or stop the actions of the UConn Division of Athletics that he\nled, thereby becoming complicit in Defendant Tsantiris's conduct.\n32.  On January 29,20l6,DefendantManuel became the 13th Director ofAthletics at his\nalma mater, the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, Michigan, where he played NCAA Dl\nfootball.\n33.  On December 21,2014, the Plaintiff emailed Defendant Tsantiris (Exhibit L), in\nwhich the Plaintiff said to him:\n[P]lease reconsider . . . taking away my scholarship for the spring. The ramifrcation\nof this is devastating to me and my future. Taking away a scholarship is a very\nserious act. I've studied the student athlete and I sincerely don't believe that lI have]\ndone anything that would be considered a violation of the scholarship agreement.\n34.  The Plaintiff s December 21 email demonstrates her state of mind at that time, being of the\nfull impression that her status as av/omen's soccer team member was restored and that she was going\nto be playing the 20 I 5-20 1 6 season, because she had met with Defendant Tsantiris on December 3,\n2014 for her evaluation and had been told she was back on the team, discussing usual team player\nbusiness such as uniforms and health insurance, etc., noting when writing to him:\n'When you evaluated me two weeks ago, you discussed your expectations of my\nperformance in the spring season. You stated, \"I want you to come back and play\nhard and make an impact on the team. You have not expressed to me that I was in\njeopardy of losing my spot on the team and my scholarship before the end of May.\nI've been very excited since our meeting and . . . working hard on [a] daily basis to\nget myself ready.\"\n(rd.)\n35.  Then Plaintiff confronted Defendant Tsantiris about his shocking phone call two\nnights prior on December 19 when, without justification, he entirely abandoned the Plaintiff:\n9\n\nCase 3:16-cv-02091-VAB   Document 1   Filed 12/19/16   Page 10 of 35\nFurther, you've advised me \"to not attend UConn\" in the spring, but if I must go to\nschool, to \"take classes at a community college\"? This doesn't sound appropriate to\nme....\n. . . fP]lease advise what has transpired over the course of the last few days\nsince your last meeting with me for player evaluation at the conclusion of the season.\n. . . I spoke with [Assistant Coach] Mags . . . fwho said] my scholarship will\nnot be up for renewal in May, but what I don't understand is how does this effect my\nscholarship for the spring?\n36.  To ensure that Defendant Tsantiris understood that the Plaintiff was not accepting the\nreason for her loss of Scholarship and that she intended to further confront Defendant Tsantiris about\nhis action, she f,rnished her email with a clear notice about her resolve: \"I'm looking forward to\nhearing back from you, and if your decision is fînal, please note that I will be appealing this so I can\nhave my chance to fînish up my classes in May . . . to transfer for fall 2015,\" because Defendant\nTsantiris had already threatened the Plaintiff with retribution if she appealed his decision. (Id )\n37.  Defendant Tsantiris advised the Plaintiff in a phone conversation  soon thereafter,\nbecause she had earned advance placement credits in high school and had extra credits for eligibility,\nto take the semester off and come back in the fall, that he would take her back then, telling her, \"You\nhave my word on it.\" But in another phone conversation the next day, Defendant Tsantiris told her\nif she appealed his decision that he would not help her transfer to another school and she would not\nbe given a good recommendation.  However, the PlaintifTwas told by Defendant Tsantiris that if she\nwalked away silently, then he would contact prospective transfer institution coaches and would not\nsay anything bad about her if the interested coach should contact him.\n38.  On December 23, 2014, the Plaintiff emailed Defendant Neal Eskin, UConn's\nAssistant Athletic Director (Exhibit M). This email expresses much of what the Plaintiff would have\n10\n\nCase 3:16-cv-02091-VAB   Document 1   Filed 12/19/16   Page 11 of 35\nexpressed in a hearing if she had been given an opportunity. That is the voice that Defendant\nTsantiris took away from the Ptaintiff by not providing her with a proper hearing and appeal.\n39. \nOn or about December 24,2014,the Plaintiff received a letter from Defendant Lucas\n(\"Cancellation Letter\") (Exhibit N), indicating that \"upon recommendation of the Division of\nAthletics and the application of NCAA By-Law 15.3.4,\" her Scholarship was being canceled for\n\"serious misconduct.\" The specifîc provision that was clearly intended and should have been cited\nmore specifically is NCAA By-Law (\"By-Law\") 15.3.4.2(c) (Exhibit O (applicable 2013-2014\nNCAA Manual cover page and By-Law).\n40, \nUpon information and belief, Defendant Tsantiris went on a recruiting trip during the\nfall semester break, and he ran into an opportunity he could not resist at any cost. Defendant Tsantiris\nneeded the Plaintiff s grant-in-aid to complete a full out-oÊstate scholarship offer he wanted to make\nto Morgan Andrews (\"Andrews\") ofMilford,NewHampshire, an accomplishedvarsitysoccerplayer\nat the University of Notre Dame who was solicited by Defendant Tsantiris to transfer to Defendant\nUConn. After canceling the Plaintiffs Scholarship, her aid was used to complete the out-of-state full\nscholarship offer to Andrews. However, Andrews did not accept the offer from Defendants UConn\nand Tsantiris but, rather, accepted an offer from the University of Southern California and transferred\nthere. Because Plaintiffs Scholarship had already been canceled by Defendant Tsantiris, it is\nunknown what happened with Plaintiffs financial aid.\n41. \nAccompanying Defendant Lucas's Cancellation Letter was a two-page guide to the\n\"University of Connecticut-Financial Aid Hearing Procedure,\" found under NCAA By-Law\n15.3.2.3 (Exhibit P (a copy of which two pages and the actual NCAA By-Law are annexed hereto\ncollectively)).\n11\n\nCase 3:16-cv-02091-VAB   Document 1   Filed 12/19/16   Page 12 of 35\n42.  By-Law 15.3.2.3 requires certain procedures to be followed and sets a \"deadline by\nwhich a student-athlete must request a hearing.\" (Exhibit P.) A deadline should be a date certain.\n43.  The Cancellation Letter merely indicated the appeal must be made \"in writing within\nfourteen business days of the receipt of this letter.\" (Exhibit N.) This requires figuring out the\n\"business days\" properly, which can be difficult for anyone around the Christmas Holidays andNew\nYear.\n44.  The Plaintiff did file her appeal with Lucas on January 14,2015 by emailed letter\n(Exhibit Q), believing it was her last day to do so.\n45.  DefendantLucas  notified the Plaintiffbyletter ofJanuuy29,2015 (\"Appeal Denial\")\n(Exhibit R) that her appeal was \"denied because the request for a hearing was not submitted within\n14 business days of the December 22,2014 notification lettet.\" Defendant Lucas's Cancellation\nLetter of December 22,2014 specified that Plaintiff must contact her office \"in writing within\nfourteen business days of the receipt of this letter.\" (Exhibit N (emphasis added).) However, the\nAppeal Denial indicates that the Plaintiff s request was denied because it was \"not submitted within\nfourteen business days ofthe D ecember22,2014  notiftcation letter,\" which makes DefendantLucas's\ntwo letters inconsistent and shows that the Plaintiff s appeal was, in fact, timely. Defendant Lucas\ncontradicted herself and showed how difficult and confusing it is to use Defendant UConn's method\nof calculating a \"deadline\" rather than specifying an exact date, such as \"January 13,2014\" as a true\ndeadline.\n46.  Under By-Law 15.3.2.3, anyreduction or cancellation of a grant-in-aid award during\nthe period for which it was awarded may not occur unless the student-athlete  is provided an\nopportunity for a hearing. It specifically says that the written notification \"shall include . . . the\nl2\n\nCase 3:16-cv-02091-VAB   Document 1   Filed 12/19/16   Page 13 of 35\ndeadline by which a student-athlete  must request a hearing.\" (Exhibit P.) The Appeal Denial\npurposefully or inadvertently provided a confusing hearing timeline and \"deadline\" date for the\nappeal that does not comply with By-Law 15.3.2.3.\n47.  Moreover, Defendant UConn's Athletics Division should have provided at a\nminimum,pursuant  to By-Law 15.3.2.3, a hearing by the university's regular student disciplinary\nauthority to determine whether \"serious misconduct\" had occurred because Defendant UConn was\nseeking to cancel the Plaintiff s one-year Contract in the middle of its term.\n48.  No such hearing was provided to the Plaintiff, nor any hearing provided before a\nqualified tribunal, as required byNCAA By-Laws and Defendant UConn's own Handbook, and as\nfurther required for all UConn sfudents under Defendant UConn's student body \"Responsibilities of\nCommunity Life: The Student Code\" (\"Student Code\") (Exhibit S), which addresses standards of\nconduct applicable to all UConn students and in which there is no definition of \"serious\nmisconduct.\"\n49. \nThe Incident over which Defendant UConn canceled the Scholarship and Contract\ncould not be considered \"serious misconduct\" without the aforementioned  required hearings for\nstudent-athletes  and all UConn students, which failure to provide them ipso facto breaches the\nContract. Evoking By-Law 15.3.4.2(c) was also, therefore, illegal and void.\n50.  The Incident is not \"serious misconduct\" undet any applicable NCAA By-Law or\nother applicable by-law, rule, regulation, guideline, or the American public norm, including UConn's\nown Student Code. The Cancellation Letter cited \"a serious misconduct issue\" as the basis for\ncanceling the Scholarship under By-Law 15.3.4. Section 2(c) of that By-Law can only be evoked\nwhen the student-athlete in the course of a grant-in-aid contract term, \"fe]ngages in serious\n13\n\nCase 3:16-cv-02091-VAB   Document 1   Filed 12/19/16   Page 14 of 35\nmisconduct wamanting substantial disciplinary penalty.\" (Exhibit O.) There must first be \"serious\nmisconduct,\" but as a prerequisite only that misconduct which warranted \"substantial disciplinary\npenalty\" can be the basis for canceling a grant-in-aid in the middle of the contract term. (Id.)\n51.  In a CBS sports article of May 29,2015 by Jon Solomon, \"SEC Meetings: New Rule\nPrevents Transfers with 'Serious Misconduct\"' (Exhibit T), he quotes the NCAA Southeastem\nConference (\"SEC\") in its new policy, showing leadership among prominent Dl conferences\nnationwide, as def,rning \"serious misconduct\" to be \"sexual assault, domestic violence or other forms\nof sexual violence.\" The SEC rule bans \"ttansfers if at a previous school the player had'limited\ndiscipline applied by a sports team, or temporary disciplinary action during an investigation.\"'\nToday, the SEC rule would preclude Plaintiff from transferring into an SEC institution and playing,\neven without a grant-in-aid scholarship, because Defendant Tsantiris's and Defendant UConn's\nDivision of Athletics' characterization of the Incident as \"serious misconduct\" along with the\ncancellation of the Scholarship as discipline would specificallypreclude  it. Conduct and discipline\nare therefore intertwined.\n52.  In another CB S Sports article by Ben Kercheval on June 3 , 2016 (Exhibit U), it was\nreported that the SEC's newly \"expanded definition of 'serious misconduct' applies to transfers who\npled guilty or no contest to a felony involving serious misconduct. Additionally, the new definition\napplies to acts of 'dating violence, stalking, or conduct of a nature that creates serious concerns about\nsafety to others.\"' The Incident atbar cannot be in any way analogized to having created serious\nconcerns of safety to others from the Plaintiffs conduct, nor of being any kind of felonious\nmisconduct.\nt4\n\nCase 3:16-cv-02091-VAB   Document 1   Filed 12/19/16   Page 15 of 35\n53. \nInhisNew YorkTimes articleofAugust26,2015,  entitled\"CollegeConferencesTry\nto Block Athletes Who Have Violent Past\" (Exhibit V), Marc Tracey comments pointedly:\nAs colleges struggle to control the public-relations  damage caused by athlete's\ncriminal behavior, prominent conferences have begun measures to keep players with\ntroubling pasts out of their teams' nationally televised colors.\nThe Big 12 this week fof August 2015] became the second major conference\nto move to bar incoming transfers who hadbeen disciplined for \"serious misconduct\"\nat their previous universities . . . modeled after the Southeastem Conference . . . [and]\nrising awareness of the issue of sexual violence by athletes on campus.\n54.  The Plaintiffs Incident could be viewed several ways from various perspectives as\nimpolite, inappropriate, offensive, and even vulgar, but it is nonetheless protected speech under the\nFirst Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.\n55. \nAfter her Scholarship was canceled, the Plaintiff, with no financial means to continue\nas a student at Defendant UConn, accepted a37o/, grant-in-aid scholarship from Hofstra University\n(\"Hofstra\") for the spring 2015 semester (ExhibitW (AgreementofJanuary 2I,2015)). Thatwas for\none semester, but her scholarship has been twice that for 2015-2016 and2016-2017 years because\nit is applied to two semesters, so she is provided with a 75o/o grant-in-aid athletic scholarship by\nHofstra.\n56.  On May 15, 2016, Tarone emailed another request letter under the CFOIA for\nDefendant UConn's records of \"NCAA Student-Athletes  Disciplined in 2014-15 Academic Year\"\n(ExhibìtX). DefendantUConn'sresponsethroughRachelKrinskyRudnick,J.D.,AssistantDirector\nof Compliance,  by email to Tarone of June 27,2016 (Exhibit Y) includes six pages in spreadsheet\nform of partially redacted personal information of student-athlete incidents and resulting discipline\nfor each. The response contains no record whatsoever of the Plaintiffs discipline in that academic\nyear. Again, Defendant Tsantiris appears to have not accounted for his canceling of the Plaintiffs\n15\n\nCase 3:16-cv-02091-VAB   Document 1   Filed 12/19/16   Page 16 of 35\nScholarship, and Defendant UConn provided an incomplete and misleading record under the CFOIA.\nDefendant Lucas also may have purposely or negligently failed to properly advise the Division of\nAthletics as to Plaintiffs Scholarship and the freed-up financial aid money resulting from its\ncancellation.\n(viotation or ritte tçi:äilDerendant uconn)\n57.  The allegations ofparagraphs I through 56 above are incorporated  by reference as\nif fully set forth herein.\n58.  Title IX, enacted in 1972, provides in relevant part:\nNo person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from\nparticipation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any\neducation program or activity receiving Federal fi nancial assistance.\n20 U.S.C. $ 1681(a).\n59. \nThe Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1987 made plain Congress's intent that \"ptogram\nor activity,\" as used in Title IX, applies to any program or activity offered by an educational\ninstitution that receives federal financial assistance, whether or not the program itself receives such\nassistance. 20 U.S.C. $ 1687. Because Defendant UConn receives federal financial assistance, its\nathletic program is subject to Title D( and Defendant UConn must comply with its requirements.\n60.  In the statute, Congress expressly delegated authority to the U.S. Department of\nHealth, Education and Welfare to promulgate regulations interpreting Title IX. 20 U.S.C. $ 1682.\nln 1975, the Department of Health, Education and Welfare promulgated these regulations as 45\nC.F.R. Part 86. The United States Department of Education later adopted these regulations and\ncodified them at 34 C.F.R. Part 106.\n6L \nThe Regulations include specific provisions that state:\nI6\n\nCase 3:16-cv-02091-VAB   Document 1   Filed 12/19/16   Page 17 of 35\nin providing any aid, benefit, or service to a student, a recipient shall not, on the basis\nof sex:\n(l)  Treat one person differently from another in determining\nwhether such person satisfies any requirement or condition for the\nor \nprovision of such aid, benefit,  service;\n(2) \nProvide different aid, benefits, or services or provide aid,\nbenefits, or services in a different manner;\n(3) \nDeny any person any such aid, benefit, or service;\n(4) \nSubject any person to separate or different rules of behavior,\nsanctions, or other treatment;\n(5) \nApply any rule concerning the domicile or residence of a\nstudent or applicant, including eligibility for in-state fees and tuition;\n(6)  Aid or perpetuate discrimination against any person by\nproviding significant assistance to any agency, organization, orperson\nwhich discriminates on the basis of sex in providing any ard, benefit\nor service to students or employees;\n(7) \nOtherwise limit any person in the enjoyment of any right,\nprivilege, advantage, or opportunity.\n34 C.F.R. $ 106.31(b).\n62. \nDefendant UConn discriminated against the Plaintiff, a female student-athlete, by\nsubjecting her to different treatment regarding disciplinary actions and sanctions than male student-\nathletes. While herconductduring  the lncidentwas unsportsmanlike,  itwas not \"severemisconduct\"\nsuch that it warranted the revocation of her Scholarship mid-year. \"Serious misconduct\" applied by\nDefendant Tsantiris to Plaintiff in abuse of her student rights was an excuse for his own\nadministrative  misconduct to benefit him as a coach, thereby displaying conduct far closer to NCAA\n\"serious misconduct\" than Plaintiffs Incident.\nI7\n\nCase 3:16-cv-02091-VAB   Document 1   Filed 12/19/16   Page 18 of 35\n63.  Upon information and belief, male student-athletes have engaged in similar acts of\nunsportsmanlike  conduct without an affect on their scholarships, and have engaged in more\ninappropriate, and sometimes illegal, conduct without having their scholarships revoked.\n64. \nOn October 2,2015, less than a year after the Plaintiffs incident, UConn football\nplayer Andrew Adams engaged in a similar act of celebration during a football game at Brigham\nYoung University, according to an October 8,2014 article inthe Hartford Courant (Exhibit Z). At\nthe end of a play, with eight minutes left in the game, Adams \"carelessly booted the dead ball into\nthe stands.\" Adams was \"called\" bythe offrcials forunsportsmanlike conduct, and incurred a 15-yard\npenalty for his team. Adams told the Courantthat it was a \"dumb play,\" that he should not have done\nit, and that he had \"learned his lesson.\"\n65. \nAlthough the Couranl reports that the coaches \"gave it to Adams pretty good after\nthe play,\" it does not appear that Adams faced any formal discipline from the team, such as\nsuspension from any games or team activity or, moreover, revocation of his scholarship. Defendant\nUConn's defensive coordinator and safeties coach, Anthony Poindexter, told the Courant that\nAdam's conduct was \"the kind of stuff you can't do at the game but no one around here is harping\non it and Andrew has been bringing it every day. It was a one-time thing he did. He'Il never do it\nagain, but I can tell you nobody felt worse than him when it happened,\" and he implied that the\naction was unintentional.  Poindexter further stated that Adams \"has a lot of responsibilities,  and he's\nready for that kind of stuff, The young man is well put together. He gets good grades in the\nclassroom; he understands and is active in the community; he understands football. He's built for all\nthis kind of sfuff. He's very important to our team and he's been doing a great job,\" and concluded\nthat \"fh]e just made a mistake. We all do.\" (Exhibit Z.)\nt8\n\nCase 3:16-cv-02091-VAB   Document 1   Filed 12/19/16   Page 19 of 35\n66.  Similarly, the Plaintiff made a mistake-the Incident-but not only did Defendant\nUConn \"harp on it\" rather than excuse her conduct, it characterized it as \"serious misconduct\" and\nsuspended her from the team and ultimately revoked her Scholarship because of it. Defendant\nUConn clearly treated the unsportsmanlike conduct of the Plaintiff, a female student-athlete,\ndifferently than they treated Adam's misconduct. Adams received no actual discipline.\n67.  Additionally, in several instances recently, male student-athletes have allegedly\nengaged in criminal conduct, resulting in criminal charges being brought against them, yet the male-\nstudent athletes have not experienced repercussions as serious as those experienced by the Plaintiff\nfor her unsportsmanlike gesture.\n68. \nOn Septemberl6, 2016, Brian Cespedes, a redshirt freshman member on the UConn\nfootball team, was involved in a fight in a home during which five people were injured, according\nto an article inthe New Haven Register (Exhibit AA). On December l0,2016,Cespedes was charged\nwith third-degree assault and second-degree breach of the peace, according to an article in the\nHartþrd Courant (Exhibit BB). A UConn spokesperson said that the coaching staffhas been aware\nof the incident since it occurred and \"addressed it at the time.\" (.9ee Exhibit Z.) However, Cespedes\nwas not suspended from the team after the flrght, not was he suspended after his arrest.\n69.  This arrest comes on the heels of the arrests of two other UConn football players,\nFelton Blackwell and Nazir Williams, on October 19. (See Exhibit AA.) Blackwell was arrested on\na felony charge of illegal possession of a weapon in a motor vehicle, and was expelled from UConn\nfollowing his arrest. Williams was charged with possession of marijuana, possession of weapon in\na motor vehicle, and possession of alcohol by a minor. Although both players were immediately\n19\n\nCase 3:16-cv-02091-VAB   Document 1   Filed 12/19/16   Page 20 of 35\nsuspended from the football team, a UConn spokesperson  said in November that V/illiams may be\nallowed to return to the team because it was his first transgression. (Exhibit BB.)\n70. \nThe examples above demonstrate  that male student-athletes enjoy the privilege of a\nmuch more lenient standard regarding team suspension and discipline than female student-athletes\nsuch as the Plaintiff. While Brian Cespedes was not suspended in light of his pending criminal\ncharges and V/illiams was suspended after his arrest but may be reinstated, the Plaintiff was\nsuspended and ultimately had her Scholarship terminated over an unsportsmanlike gesture. In no way\ndoes the Plaintiff s conduct during the Incident rival that of Cespedes and V/illiams, who are facing\ncriminal charges but remain on their team.\n71. \nThrough FOIL requests to UConn, the Plaintiff has obtained a spreadsheet listing the\nviolations of student-athletes during the 2014-2015 school year and the discipline that resulted.\n(Exhibit Y.) Because of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (\"FERPA\"), all personal\nidenti$ring information about the student-athletes, including their names, sex, and sport they play,\nhad been redacted from the spreadsheet by the time the Plaintiff received it.\n72. \nIn Exhibit Y, there are five incidents categorizedas \"theft from bookstore.\" For four\nof these incidents, the punishment was \"Warning [and] Living Your Values Workshop,\" while for\nthe fifth incident, the punishment was \"'Warning [and] Living Your Values Workshop [and]\nEducational Project.\" Upon information and belief, one of the bookshop thefts was perpetrated by\na male member of the soccer team. Exhibit Y shows that this male student-athlete received the\npunishment of \"Waming [and] Living Your Values Workshop,\" and possibly an \"Educational\nProject.\"\n20\n\nCase 3:16-cv-02091-VAB   Document 1   Filed 12/19/16   Page 21 of 35\n73. \nThe only incident that warranted any discipline more serious than \"university\nprobation\" was an assault that resulted in expulsion. The next most serious punishment, \"university\nprobation,\" was given to athletes who were found to engage in \"off-campus nuisance violation,\"\n\"transport due to alcohol,\" \"possession of alcohol, uncooperative\"  in connection with an active status\nfrom a previous case, \"moped in room\" in connection with an active status from a previous case,\nacademic integrity, \"off-campus party,\" and \"plagiarism.\" (Exhibit Y.) Each of these incidents\ninvolved a fînding that the student either engaged in \"endangering behavior,\" a violation of the\nalcohol and drugs policy, a violation of the on-campus housing contract, a violation of academic\nintegrity, \"disruptive behavior,\" or some combination thereof. No student was placed on probation\nfor \"disruptive behavior\" alone. (Id.)\n74. \nThe Plaintiffs lncident of unsportsmanlike conduct did not appear on Exhibit Y,\nwhich purported to contain all the oflficial cases of Defendant UConn's student-athlete discipline in\nthe 2014-2015 school year.\n75. \nWithout being able to view the redacted information on the spreadsheet, the true\nextent of Defendant UConn's differential treatment of female student-athletes is not yet known.\n76.  However, upon information and belief, Defendant UConn addressed the Plaintiffs\nIncident differentlythan  theywould have had the Plaintiffbeen a male student-athlete. By subjecting\nfemale student-athletes such as the Plaintiff to more shingent disciplinary standards, Defendant\nUConn discriminated against the Plaintiff on the basis of sex, in violation of Title IX.\n. \n77  On or aboutNovember29,20l4,  while the UConn men's basketball team was in San\nJuan, Puerto Rico, playing in a tournament, several players of the team engaged in a violation of\nteam rules. The exact nature of the violation is not known to the Plaintiff at this time, as FERPA has\n2t\n\nCase 3:16-cv-02091-VAB   Document 1   Filed 12/19/16   Page 22 of 35\nprevented the Plaintiffs New York counsel, Tarone, from gaining access to the information about\nthis incident that he requested under CFOIA.\n78.  By letter to Defendant UConn of March24,2015 (Exhibit CC), Tarone requested the\n\"2074-15 men's basketball team code or rules governing player conduct.\" In response, Defendant\nUConn's Compliance & Public Information Specialist, Liz Vitullo (\"Vitullo\"), responded by letter\nof April 6,2015 (Exhibit BB), \"Attached please find the document you requested in your Freedom\nof Information request,\" which was Handbook and nothing more. The lack of any explanation as to\nwhy only the Handbook was being sent to Tarone, without any reference to the records requested not\nquali$ring under CFOIA as \"records,\" was deemed as a finessing nonresponse,  aimed to challenge\nthe request.\n79.  Tarone then appealed to Connecticut's Freedom of lnformation Commission.  At its\nhearing, Tarone learned from Vitullo's testimony that the basketball team's rules are oral and\ntherefore, pursuant to CFOIA, not a \"record\" under CFOIA even though they would be required to\nbe provided under the federal FOIL and most states' version of FOIL.\n80. \nEven though UConn men's basketball \"team rules \" were oral, they exist. The only\nway to learn more about the oral rules as applicable at all times herein and as publicly represented\nin news conferences by the team's head coach, Kevin Ollie (\"Ollie\"), is through discovery in this\nlawsuit.\n81. \nThevarious organizationalstandardsofstudent-athleteconductareaddressedbutnot\nclearly set forth, as follows:\nAll UConn students are subject to the University of Connecticut\nStudent Code including the \"Responsibilities of Community Life\" .\n. . while involved in off-campus University activities. In addition, you\nas a student-athlete are expected to abide bythe Division of Athletics\n22\n\nCase 3:16-cv-02091-VAB   Document 1   Filed 12/19/16   Page 23 of 35\nStudent-Athlete  Code of Conduct. . . In addition, each student-athlete\nis subject to all rules and regulations that are required for individual\nparticipation on a specific team. While these rules may be particular\nto each team, they are presented to the student-athlete by the coaching\nstaff with the full support of the athletic administration.\n(Exhibit G, at 5.)\n82. \nThe foregoing indicates how each team can have its own specific rules in addition to\nthe rules applying to all student-athletes. Those rules can be recorded or oral, in which case they may\nand may not be discoverable under CFOIA.\n83. \nOn Sunday,November23,2Ùl4,accordingto  Hartfurd CourantreporterDom  Amore\nin his article of November 24,2014, \"Rakim Lubin, Omar Calhoun Among 4 UConn Players\nSuspended\" (Exhibit DD), the defending national champions, UConn's men's basketball team, while\nin San Juan, Puerto Rico, played'West Virginia without four of its players due to \"violation of team\nrules.\" Coach Ollie would not disclose any further information about the incident(s) in San Juan.\nWhen asked what the \"violation\" was, Ollie responded: \"I have no comment on it, . . . we'll assess\nthe situation when we get back to Connecticut.\" (Id.)\n84. \nFour days later, when back in Storrs, Connecticut, Ollie was quoted by Amore in his\nNovember 28,2014 Hart/'ord Courant article, \"Ollie Reinstates Calhoun, Lubin; Texas Up Next\"\n(Exhibit EE). Having cleared all the suspended players without further discipline, Ollie said:\nEverybody's on a short leash, they know. Everybody who didn't get\nin trouble, they're on a short leash. I'm just not going to tolerate\nbreaking rules. We've got team rules n place and they understand that.\nAs a man, you learn your lesson and that's what we're are here to\nprovide[.] . . . fT]hey've got two choices: to get better from it or leave\nthe program.\n(I d.

No FERPA\ninformation was claimed by Ollie as a basis for not disclosing the rule(s) broken.\n86. \nUpon information and belief, the violation of the men's basketball team was more\nserious than the Plaintiffs lncident. As a result of their violation of team rules in Puerto Rico, several\nmember of the men's varsity basketball team were suspended, although none had their scholarships\nrevoked as the Plaintiffhad. The U.S. Attorneyfor San Juan, Puerto Rico, should investigate for any\ntruly serious misconduct, including any violations of law.\n87 .  Accordingly, upon information and belief, DefendantUConn subjected the Plaintiff\nto a more severe penalty for her lncident than it did for male student-athletes who were believed to\nhave engaged in more serious misconduct, in violation of the Plaintiffs constitutional rights.\n88. \nAs a proximate result of Defendant UConn's conduct, the Plaintiff has suffered, and\nwill continue to suffer, general damages, including mental and emotional pain and suffering,\nhumiliation , fear, anxiety, and loss of personal and professional reputation.\n89.  As a further result of the Defendants' conduct, Plaintiff has suffered, and will\ncontinue to suffer, special damages. These damages include her cost oftuition, room andboard, fees,\nbooks, and meals at Hofstra. While the Plaintiff had a full Scholarship to Defendant UConn, she\nreceived only a 7 5Yo Grant to Hofstra, leaving her responsible for the remaining costs. The Plaintiff\nhas been forced to take out loans to cover her expenses at Hofstra, the costs associated with which\nare a further element of the damages.\n24\n\nCase 3:16-cv-02091-VAB   Document 1   Filed 12/19/16   Page 25 of 35\n90.  The Plaintiff has been required to retain the undersigned attorney to prosecute this\naction. Therefore, the Plaintiff is entitled to recover reasonable attorney's fees, expenses, and expert\nfees pursuant to 42 U.S.C. $ 1988.\nII\nCOUNT \nViolation Of Constitutional Rights, 42 U.S.C. $ 1983, Equal Protection\n(Against Defendants Manuel, Tsantiris, And Lucas)\n. \n91  The allegations of paragraphs 1 through 90 above are incorporated by reference as\nif fully set forth herein.\n92. \nThe Plaintiffs contract with Defendant UConn created a property interest both in its\nprotection against cancellation absent serious misconduct or other conditions and in the completion\nof its terms.\n93.  As discussed in Count I, Defendant UConn arbitrarily discriminated against the\nPlaintiff, a female student-athlete, by subjecting her to different treatment than male student-athletes\nregarding disciplinary actions and sanctions for unsportsmanlike conduct.\n94.  The Plaintiffs rights under the Equal Protection Clause of the U.S. Constitution\nrequire that the Defendants treat all similarly situated individuals similarly. By subjecting female\nstudent-athletes to more stringent disciplinary standards than male student-athletes,  the Defendants\ntreated the Plaintiff differently than they would have had the Plaintiff been a male.\n95. \nAs set forth above, the Plaintiff lost her Scholarship over the Incident, which the\nDefendants classified as serious misconduct. By contrast, similar unsportsmanlike conduct by a male\nstudent-athlete resulted in no discipline or sanctions, and more serious violations of the Code of\nStudent Conduct by male athletes, such as theft, resulted in only minor discipline.\n25\n\nCase 3:16-cv-02091-VAB   Document 1   Filed 12/19/16   Page 26 of 35\n96. \nThis practice of subjecting female student-athletes to stricter standards of conduct\nthan males caused serious harm to the Plaintiff, resulting in the loss ofher Scholarship, and deprived\nher of her constitutional rights to equal protection.\n97 .  As a proximate result of the Defendants' conduct, the Plaintiff has suffered, and will\ncontinue to suffer, general damages, including mental and emotional pain and suffering, humiliation,\nanxiety, and loss ofpersonal and professional  reputation.\n98.  As a further result of the Defendants' conduct, the Plaintiff has suffered, and will\ncontinue to suffer, special damages. These damages include her cost oftuition, room and board, fees,\nbooks, and meals at Hofstra. While the Plaintiff had a full Scholarship to Defendant UConn, she\nreceived only a 7 5Yo Grantto Hofstra, leaving her responsible for the remaining costs. The Plaintiff\nhas been forced to take out loans to cover her expenses at Hofstra, the costs associated with which\nare a further element of the damages suffered.\n99. \nThe Defendants violated the Plaintiffs rights intentionally, maliciously, and with\nconscious disregard of the Plaintiff s rights. Therefore, the Plaintiff is entitled to recover punitive\ndamages from the Defendants.\n100. The Plaintiff has been required to retain the undersigned attorney to prosecute this\naction. Therefore, the Plaintiff is entitled to recover reasonable attomey's fees, expenses, and expert\nfees pursuantto 42 U.S.C. $ 1988.\n101. By reason of the described conduct, the Defendants are liable to Plaintiff under 42\nU.S.C. $ 1983 for injuries suffered by the Plaintiff, in that their conduct deprived the Plaintiff of\nrights, privileges, and immunities granted Plaintiff by the U.S. Constitution.\nIII\nCount \nViolation of Constitutional Rights, 42 U.S.C. $ 1983, Procedural Due Process\n26\n\nCase 3:16-cv-02091-VAB   Document 1   Filed 12/19/16   Page 27 of 35\n(Against Defendants Manuel, Tsantiris, And Lucas)\n102. The allegations of paragaphs 1 through I 0l above are incorporated by reference as\nif fully set forth herein.\n03. \nThe Plaintiff s contract with Defendant UConn created a property interest both in its\n1 \nprotection against cancellation absent serious misconduct or other conditions and in the completion\nof its terms.\n104. The deadline contained in the Cancellation Letter, indicating that an appealmust be\nmade \"in writing within fourteen business days of the receipt of this letter,\" was unconstitutionally\nvague and nonspecific enough to cause confusion. (Exhibit N.)\n105. The vague deadline in the Cancellation Letter left it to 19-year-old student-athlete\nPlaintiff to figure out what a \"business day\" was during Defendant UConn's holiday break, setting\nher up to miscalculate it. (Exhibit N.)\n106. The Plaintiff was, in fact, confused, and she believed that she had filed her appeal\nwithin the required timeframe, but Defendant UConn and Lucas disagreed and found that her appeal\nwas untimely based upon a deadline inconsistent with the Cancellation Letter.\n. \nI07  The vague deadline in the Cancellation Letter, indicating that an appeal must be filed\nwithin 14 business days of receipt, contradicted the procedures set forth in the \"University of\nConnecticut-Financial  Aid Hearing Procedure,\" which stated that \"the student-athlete will have l4\nbusiness days from the date on the notification letter to submit a written request for a hearing.\"\n(Exhibit P.)\n27\n\nCase 3:16-cv-02091-VAB   Document 1   Filed 12/19/16   Page 28 of 35\n108. By filing her appeal on January 14, 2015, 14 business days after receipt of the\nCancellation Letter, the Plaintiffs appeal was timely in light of the standard set forth in the\nCancellation Letter.\n109. Despite this, the Plaintiff had her Scholarship terminated without a proper hearing\nor an opportunity to be heard.\n10. \nI  Defendant UConn easily could have specified the actual deadline date in its letter,\nthereby providing clear notice that would be indisputable.  If the deadline was stated as \"January 13,\n2015,\" would have left no room for error and would have been consistent with due process.\n1. \nI 1  The Defendants'termination of the Plaintiffs scholarship deprived her of a property\ninterest without procedural due process as required by the U.S. Constitution.\nII2.  As a proximate result of the Defendants'conduct, the Plaintiff has suffered, and will\ncontinue to suffer, general damages, including mental and emotional pain and suffering, humiliation,\nanxiety, and loss ofpersonal and professional  reputation.\n113. As a further result of the Defendants' conduct, the Plaintiff has suffered, and will\ncontinue to suffer, special damages. These damages include her cost of tuition, room and board, fees,\nbooks, and meals at Hofstra. While the Plaintiff had a full Scholarship to Defendant UConn, she\nreceived only a 75o/o Grantto Hofstra, leaving her responsible for the remaining costs. The Plaintiff\nhas been forced to take out loans to cover her expenses at Hofstra, the costs associated with which\nare a further element of the damages suffered.\nLI4. \nThe Defendants violated the Plaintiffs rights intentionally, maliciously, and with\nconscious disregard of the Plaintiff s rights. Therefore, the Plaintiff is entitled to recover punitive\ndamages from the Defendants.\n28\n\nCase 3:16-cv-02091-VAB   Document 1   Filed 12/19/16   Page 29 of 35\n. \n1 I 5  The Plaintiff has been required to retain the undersigned attorney to prosecute this\naction. Therefore, the Plaintiff is entitled to recover reasonable attorney's fees, expenses, and expert\nfees pursuant to 42 U.S.C. $ 1988.\n116. By reason of the described conduct, the Defendants are liable to Plaintiff under 42\nU.S.C. $ 1983 for injuries suffered by the Plaintiff, in that their conduct deprived the Plaintiff of\nrights, privileges, and immunities granted Plaintiff by the U.S. Constitution.\nCOUNT IV\nViolation Of Constitutional Rights, 42 U.S.C. $ 1983, First Amendment\n(Against Defendants Manuel, Tsantiris, And Lucas)\n. \nIl7  The allegations ofparagraphs I through I I 6 above are incorporated by reference as\nif fully set forth herein.\n18. \nI  The Plaintiff s conduct during the Incident, although offensive and inappropriate, is\nfree speech and is protected by the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.\n119. \nThePlaintiffsconductduringthelncidentwasspeechofaprivate  citizenonamatter\nof public concern.\n120. The Defendants violated the Plaintiffs right to free speech by terminating her\nContract as a result of her protected expression during the Incident.\nl2l. \nThe Defendants acted intentionally and with callous disregard for the Plaintiff s\nclearly established constitutional rights.\n122. As a proximate result of the Defendants' conduct, the Plaintiff has suffered, and will\ncontinue to suffer, general damages, including mental and emotional pain and suffering, humiliation,\nfear, anxiety, and loss ofpersonal and professional  reputation.\n29\n\nCase 3:16-cv-02091-VAB   Document 1   Filed 12/19/16   Page 30 of 35\n123. As a further result of the Defendants' conduct, the Plaintiff has suffered, and will\ncontinue to suffer, special damages, including her cost of tuition, room and board, fees, books, and\nmeals at Hofstra. While the Plaintiff had a full scholarship to Defendant UConn, she received only\na75Yo Grant to Hofstra, leaving herresponsible  for the remaining costs. The Plaintiff has been\nforced to take out loans to cover her expenses at Hoßtra, the costs associated with which are a\nfurther element of the damages suffered.\nI24. \nThe Defendants violated the Plaintiffs rights intentionally, maliciously, and with\nconscious disregard of the Plaintiff s rights. Therefore, the Plaintiff is entitled to recover punitive\ndamages from the Defendants.\n125. The Plaintiff has been required to retain the undersigned attorney to prosecute this\naction. Therefore, the Plaintiff is entitled to recover reasonable attorney's fees, expenses, and expert\nfees pursuantto 42 U.S.C. $ 1988.\nCOUNT V\nBreach Of Contract\n(Against Defendants UConn, Manuel, Tsantiriso And Lucas)\n126. \nThe allegations ofparagraphs 1 through 125 above are incorporated byreference as\nif fully set forth herein.\n, \n127  The Plaintiff performed all the conditions, covenants, promises, and agreements\nrequired of her under the terms of the Contract.\n128. \nThe Contract was subject to the respective student and student-athlete codes, rules,\nand by-laws of Defendant UConn, the NCAA, and the ACC.\n. \n129  The Defendants breached the Contract by canceling the Plaintiff s Scholarship without\nproviding her an opportunity for a hearing, as required by the NCAA By-Laws.\n30\n\nCase 3:16-cv-02091-VAB   Document 1   Filed 12/19/16   Page 31 of 35\n130. By providing only vague and nonspecific information about the deadline for filing\nan appeal, as detailed supra in the paragraphs 41-45, the Defendants violated NCAA By-Law\n15.3.2.3, requiring a hearing opportunity. Plaintiff received no hearing opportunity.\n. \n131  Because the opportunity for a hearing was not provided to the Plaintiff, the Incident\nover which Defendant UConn canceled the Contract could not be considered \"serious misconduct\"\nbecause the requisite student body determination  under NCAA By-Laws was never made. Indeed,\nthe definition of \"serious misconduct\" does not exist, but it is well understood to be felonious or\nother conduct of a criminal nature highly punished by society.\n132. \nThe Incident was, in fact, not \"serious misconduct\" under any applicable NCAA By-\nLaw or other applicable rule, regulation, or guideline, or the American public norrn, including the\nUConn Student Body or Division of Athletics StudenrAthlete Codes of Conduct. It was not even\nclose, and it cannot be reasonably established as in any way applicable to Plaintiffs lncident.\n133. By disregarding the conditions of the Contract and the rules and by-laws to which it\nwas subject, the Defendants breached the Contract.\n134. Under the new structure of NCAA enforcement violations as of August2}l3, a four-\nlevel structure has been instituted to focus on breaches of conduct that seriously undermine or\nthreaten the integrity of the NCAA Collegiate model. (,lee Exhibit FF (copy ofNCAA.org  article of\nAugust 1,2013 and applicable NCAA2013-2014  Manual regarding By-Lawl9.1 et seq.).) If the\nDefendants' termination of the Plaintiff because of the lncident is found to violate the NCAA\nregulations as a \"severe breach of conduct,\" IJConn could be disciplined accordingly as a member\ninstitution under By-Law 19.1.1 as punishment.\n3l\n\nCase 3:16-cv-02091-VAB   Document 1   Filed 12/19/16   Page 32 of 35\n135. \nAs aproximate result of the Defendants'conduct,  the Plaintiffhas suffered, andwill\ncontinue to suffer, general damages, including mental and emotional pain and suffering, humiliation,\nfear, anxiety, and loss ofpersonal and professional reputation.\n136. As a further result of the Defendants' conduct, Plaintiff has suffered, and will\ncontinue to suffer, special damages. These damages include her cost oftuition, room and board, fees,\nbooks, and meals at Hofstra, added travel expanses and other costs. While the Plaintiff had a ful1\nScholarship to Defendant UConn, she received only a 7 5o/o GranTto Hofstra, leaving her responsible\nfor the remaining costs. The Plaintiff has been forced to take out loans to cover her expenses at\nHofstra, the costs associated with which are a further element of the damages suffered.\n. \n137  The Defendants breached the Contract wantonly and with a reckless and conscious\ndisregard ofthe Plaintiff s rights. Therefore, the Plaintiff is entitled to recoverpunitive damages from\nthe Defendants.\nCOUNT VI\nNegligent Infliction Of Emotional Distress\n(Against Defendants Uconn, Manuel, Tsantiriso And Lucas)\n138. \nThe allegations of paragraphs 1 through 137 above are incorporated by reference as\nif fully set forth herein.\n. \n139  The conduct of the Defendants created an unreasonable risk of causing the Plaintiff\nextreme emotional distress in the circumstances.\n140. \nGiven the sheer surprise during semester break of learning her Scholarship was\ncanceled, especially as it was a jolting reversal of the coach's prior conduct consistent with the\nPlaintiffs retaining her Scholarship, the Plaintiffs extreme emotional distress was foreseeable.\n\nCase 3:16-cv-02091-VAB   Document 1   Filed 12/19/16   Page 33 of 35\nl4l. \nFor an 18-year-old at college for the first time, to learn one week before her 19th\nbirthday that she no longer was on her team, that she could not any longer wear any team gear, and\nthat she was effectively ostracized from the women's varsity soccer team, that she was no longer able\nto attend Defendant UConn or participate in any team activities, and that she would have to change\nschools and would lose personal relationships formed in her first semester, in addition to the extreme\nemotional distress of losing her Scholarship, it was entirely foreseeable to cause and result in an\nillness to the Plaintiff, including depression.\nI42. \nLInherDecember23, 2014emailto Eskin, Plaintiffexpressedherextremeemotional\ndistress to Defendant UConn's Assistant Athletic Director:\nI thank you very much for all your effort in getting coach's\ndecision reconsidered. . . .

      "text": "UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \n  DISTRICT OF CONNECTICUT \n \n   \nNORIANA RADWAN,   \n  Plaintiff,   \n   \n  v.     No. 3:16-cv-2091(VAB) \n \nUNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT BOARD \nOF TRUSTEES, WARDE MANUEL, \nLEONARD TSANTIRIS AND MONA \nLUCAS \n  Defendants. \n \nRULING ON DEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO DISMISS \nNoriana Radwan filed this lawsuit pro se on December 19, 2016, alleging that the \nUniversity of Connecticut and several of its employees violated her rights under both federal and \nstate law when they rescinded her athletic scholarship. Defendants now move to partially dismiss \nthe Complaint.  \nFor the reasons stated below, the motion is GRANTED in part and DENIED in part.  \nI.   FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND \n  Noriana Radwan (“Plaintiff” or “Radwan”) first enrolled at the University of Connecticut \n(“UConn”)1 in 2014 as a full-time student and recipient of an athletic scholarship to play soccer \nat the school. Compl. ¶¶ 8, 10-13. Each of the defendants in the present case served a function \nwithin UConn’s athletic program. Warde Manuel (“Manuel”) was the Director of Athletics at \nUConn. Id. ¶ 3. Leonard Tsantiris (“Tsantiris”) was the head coach of the women’s varsity \n                                                 \n1 UConn’s Board of Trustees is named as the defendant in this action, sued in its official \ncapacity. See Compl., ECF No. 1.  \n  1\n\nsoccer team. Id. ¶ 4. Mona Lucas (“Lucas”) was the Director of Student Financial Aid Services \nand coordinated the scholarship Radwan received to play for the UConn women’s soccer team. \nId. ¶ 5, 11.  \n  Before her arrival on campus, Radwan alleges she was sent a letter by Lucas offering a \n“‘Full Out-of-State Grant-in-Aid’ conditional athletics scholarship.” Id. ¶ 11. Accompanying the \nletter was a letter of intent “providing a good-faith commitment to attend” UConn and a contract \nthat would govern the provision of the scholarship. Id. ¶¶ 12-13. The contract provided that \nRadwan would abide by the rules and bylaws set out by the university and the NCAA. Id. ¶ 13.  \n  Radwan enrolled in UConn and joined the soccer team. Id. ¶ 12. On November 9, 2014, \nRadwan and the UConn’s women’s soccer team traveled to Tampa, Florida, to play in the \nAmerican Athletic Conference (“ACC”) Championship. Id. ¶ 14. UConn defeated the University \nof South Florida in penalty kicks, earning an automatic place in the NCAA Division I \nchampionship. Id. During the celebrations on the field immediately following the victory, \nRadwan showed her middle finger to a television camera, a gesture broadcast on ESPNU online. \nId. \n  Tsantiris later confronted Radwan with a picture of the gesture, allegedly noting that “it \nwas all over the Internet and television.” Id. ¶ 15. He then allegedly told Radwan that he had to \nsuspend her from all team activities, and prevent her from playing in the NCAA Championship \nTournament. Id. Tsantiris then issued a press release characterizing Radwan’s action as an \n“obscene gesture.” Id. ¶ 16. Radwan alleges, however, that she continued to prepare for the \n2015-2016 season, with no indication initially that her scholarship would be revoked. Id. \n  On December 19, 2014, Tsantiris allegedly called Radwan and notifed her of the \ncancellation of her scholarship because of the incident in Tampa. Id. ¶ 30. On that same call, \n  2\n\nTsantiris allegedly advised her not to attend UConn in the spring. Id. ¶ 35. In subsequent calls, \nTsantiris allegedly told her she might come back after a semester away from UConn, but that “if \nshe appealed his decision that he would not help her transfer to another school and she would not \nbe given a good recommendation.” Id. ¶ 37. Radwan then received a letter from Lucas canceling \nher scholarship. Id. ¶ 39.  \nRadwan alleges that, in the years following UConn’s revocation of her scholarship, male \nstudent-athletes at UConn have “engaged in similar acts of unsportsmanlike conduct without an \naffect on their scholarships.” Id. ¶ 63. She alleges that these incidents were more serious than the \none at issue in this case, including:  \n  A football player who kicked a “dead ball” into the stands in celebration, but was not \nsubject to formal discipline, id. ¶¶ 64-65; \n  A freshman football player who remained on the team after being involved in a fight, \nduring which five people were injured and the player was charged with third-degree \nassault and second-degree breach of the peace, id. ¶ 68; \n  Several basketball players who were initially suspended for violating team rules in a \nmanner “not known to the Plaintiff at this time” but eventually reinstated, id. ¶¶ 83-86. \n  Several disciplinary incidents involving UConn athletes obtained through a Connecticut \nFreedom of Information Law request, id. ¶¶ 71-73. \nShe alleges that these incidents demonstrate that “UConn subjected the Plaintiff to a more severe \npenalty for her Incident than it did for male student-athletes who were believed to have engaged \nin more serious misconduct . . . .” Id. ¶ 87. \nAdditionally, Radwan alleges that Tsantiris went on a recruiting trip before the incident, \nand wished to secure the transfer to UConn of another player. Id. ¶ 40. She claims that Tsantiris \n  3\n\n“needed the Plaintiff’s grant-in-aid to complete a full out-of-state scholarship offer he wanted to \nmake” and that Radwan’s “aid was used to complete” that out-of-state scholarship. Id.  \nRadwan filed the Complaint pro se,2 alleging that UConn had violated Title IX, 20 \nU.S.C. § 1681. Additionally, she alleged that, under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, defendants Manuel, \nTsantiris, and Lucas had violated her First Amendment rights and her equal protection and \nprocedural due process rights. Finally, she alleged two state law claims — breach of contract and \nnegligent infliction of emotional distress — against all defendants.  \nDefendants move to partially dismiss the Complaint on three separate grounds. Defs. \nMem. of Law, ECF No. 13-1 at 1. First, UConn moves to dismiss the constitutional violations \nand state law claims, invoking Eleventh Amendment immunity. Defs. Mem. at 6-8. Second, \nManuel, Tsantiris, and Lucas moves to dismiss the claims brought against them in their official \ncapacity, arguing that, in that capacity, they are not “persons” within the meaning of § 1983. Id. \nat 6-8. \nThird, they move to dismiss the Complaint under 12(b)(5) for inadequate service of \nprocess. Id. at 9-15. They argue that Manuel was never served in his official capacity, and \nTsantiris was served three days after the deadline provided by the Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure. Id. at 13. Therefore, they argue that the Complaint should be dismissed with respect \nto those two defendants. Id. at 15. \nII.  STANDARD OF REVIEW \n                                                 \n2 Defendants dispute whether Radwan was truly acting pro se when she filed the Complaint. See \nDefs. Mem. at 14. They note that “upon information and belief Attorney Gregory Tarone is \nproviding counsel to the plaintiff,” that the Complaint makes numerous allegations related to \nAttorney Tarone’s work, including a request for attorneys’ fees, and that the docket shows \nAttorney Tarone paid the filing fee. Id.  \n  4\n\nIn evaluating a motion under Rule 12(b)(1) for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, the \nCourt “must accept as true all material factual allegations in the complaint but need not draw \ninferences favorable to the party asserting jurisdiction.” Shipping Fin. Servs. Corp. v. Drakos, \n140 F.3d 129, 131 (2d Cir. 1998). The plaintiff bears the burden of showing that subject matter \njurisdiction is proper based on facts existing at the time he or she filed the complaint. Scelsa v. \nCity Univ. of New York, 76 F.3d 37, 40 (2d Cir. 1996) (citations omitted).   \nOn a Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(2) motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction, a \n“plaintiff bears the burden of showing that the court has jurisdiction over the defendant.” In re \nMagnetic Audiotape Antitrust Litig., 334 F.3d 204, 206 (2d Cir. 2003). “Prior to discovery, a \nplaintiff challenged by a jurisdiction testing motion may defeat the motion by pleading in good \nfaith legally sufficient allegations of jurisdiction. At that preliminary stage, the plaintiff's prima \nfacie showing may be established solely by allegations.” Ball v. Metallurgie Hoboken-Overpelt, \nS.A., 902 F.2d 194, 197 (2d Cir. 1990). Such allegations must be made through the plaintiff's \n“own affidavits and supporting materials.” Marine Midland Bank, N.A. v. Miller, 664 F.2d 899, \n904 (2d Cir. 1981). In deciding a 12(b)(2) motion to dismiss, a court must construe the pleadings \nand affidavits in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, resolving all doubts in her favor. See \nA.I. Trade Finance, Inc. v. Petra Bank, 989 F.2d 76, 79-80 (2d Cir. 1993). \n“Sufficiency of service is a precondition for the court's exercise of jurisdiction over a \nparty and, therefore, constitutes an interrelated ground on which to dismiss a case for lack of \npersonal jurisdiction pursuant to Rule 12(b)(2).” Carliell v. Am. Inv. Exch., LLC, No. 3:12-CV-\n1700 JCH, 2013 WL 4782133, at *2 (D. Conn. Sept. 5, 2013); see also Jackson v. State of Conn. \nDep't of Pub. Health, No. 3:15-CV-750 (CSH), 2016 WL 3460304, at *8 (D. Conn. June 20, \n  5\n\n2016) (“In the absence of proper service, a district court lacks personal jurisdiction over those \ndefendants not properly served.”). \nUnder Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(5), a party may file a motion to dismiss due \nto “insufficient service of process.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(5). A motion to dismiss under Rule \n12(b)(5) may be granted “if the plaintiff fails to serve a copy of the summons and complaint on \nthe defendants pursuant to Rule 4 of the Federal Rules, which sets forth the federal requirements \nfor service.” Rzayeva v. United States, 492 F. Supp. 2d 60, 74 (D. Conn. 2007). “Once validity of \nservice has been challenged, it becomes the plaintiff's burden to prove that service of process was \nadequate.” Cole v. Aetna Life & Cas., 70 F. Supp. 2d 106, 110 (D. Conn. 1999). \nIII.  DISCUSSION \nDefendants move to dismiss the Complaint on several different grounds. They first argue \nthat dismissal of Counts II through IV was appropriate under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1) based on \nUConn’s Eleventh Amendment immunity. Defs. Mem. at 1. They argue that UConn cannot be \nsubject to Counts V and VI of the Complaint because state law prohibits suing state agencies. Id. \nat 9. Additionally, they move to dismiss Counts II through VI alleged against Defendants \nManuel, Tsantiris, and Lucas in their official capacities. Id. at 6-9. Finally, the Court must decide \nwhether Counts II through VI should be dismissed as to Defendant Tsantiris in his individual \ncapacity under 12(b)(5) for insufficient service of process. \nA.     Dismissal of Radwan’s Official Capacity Claims \nIn response to Defendants’ motion to dismiss, Radwan clarified the claims in her \nComplaint and conceded that any claims brought against UConn or any specifically named state \nactor in its or his or her official capacity should be dismissed. Specifically, she indicates that \nCounts II, III, and IV — those brought under § 1983 — were not brought against UConn or \n  6\n\nagainst the other defendants in their official capacities. Instead, she agrees that those counts “are \nbrought against Defendants Manuel, Tsantiris and [Lucas] in their individual capacities only.” Pl. \nResp. Br. at 2.3 Additionally, Radwan notes that she “does not object to dismissal of Counts Five \nand Six,” the state law claims, “as against UConn while preserving the allegations of Counts \nFive and Six as against Defendants Manuel, Tsantiris, and Lucas in their individual capacities.” \nId. at 3.  \nBased on these concessions, the Court finds that the only remaining claim against UConn \nis Count I of the Complaint, alleging violations of Title IX. See, e.g., Abbate v. Cendant Mobility \nServs. Corp., No. 3:03-cv-1858(DJS), 2004 WL 1431704, at *1 (D. Conn. June 23, 2004) \n(dismissing two counts where plaintiff conceded the Court lacked jurisdiction). Counts II \nthrough VI will proceed against Manuel and Lucas in their individual capacities, as the parties do \nnot dispute that both have received adequate service. Defendants’ motion to dismiss the claims \nagainst Manuel, Tsantiris, and Lucas in their official capacities and to dismiss Counts V and VI \nagainst UConn therefore is GRANTED.  \nB.  Untimely Service of Process \nThe Court still must address the timeliness of the service of process on Tsantiris. \nTsantiris argues that the Complaint should be dismissed because he “in his individual capacity \nwas served the complaint three days after the expiration of the 90-day time period required by \nRule 4(m).” Defs. Mem. at 12. Therefore, he argues that service was inadequate and — because \nhe argues that Radwan cannot demonstrate good cause for the untimely service — the Complaint \nshould be dismissed. Id. at 13-14. The Court disagrees. \n                                                 \n3 Plaintiff’s Response Brief mislabels the parties as “Defendants Manuel, Tsantiris, and Warde.” \nPl. Resp. Br. at 2. Subsequent reference, however, makes it clear that Plaintiff intended to \nreference Mona Lucas. Id. at 3 (listing defendants as Manuel, Tsantiris and Lucas).  \n  7\n\nService of process is governed by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 4. Rule 4 provides, in \nrelevant part, that: \nIf a defendant is not served within 90 days after the complaint is filed, the court—\non motion or on its own after notice to the plaintiff—must dismiss the action \nwithout prejudice against that defendant or order that service be made within a \nspecified time. But if the plaintiff shows good cause for the failure, the court must \nextend the time for service for an appropriate period. \nFed. R. Civ. P. 4(m). A plaintiff may serve an individual defendant by “following state law for \nserving a summons” in state courts, serving the individual personally, leaving a copy at the \nindividual’s dwelling or usual place of abode, or delivering the documents to an agent. Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 4(e)(2). \n  Radwan served Tsantiris personally, as prescribed in Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(e)(2)(A). She \nacknowledges, however, that the service of process was untimely. See Pl. Resp. Br. at 3 (noting \ndefendants’ argument and stating that “there is good cause for the very slight delay in serving \nDefendant Tsantiris for several reasons . . . .”). The motion to dismiss therefore should be \ngranted, unless Radwan can either show good cause or that, within the Court’s discretion, she \nmerits an extension of time to effect service beyond the Rule 4(m) “window.” John v. City of \nBridgeport et al, 309 F.R.D. 149, 153-54 (D. Conn 2015); see also Zapata v. City of New York, \n502 F.3d 192, 196 (2d Cir. 2007) (noting that Rule 4(m) requires district courts to extend the \ntime for service if good cause is shown and holding that “district courts have discretion to grant \nextensions even in the absence of good cause”). \nCourts in the Second Circuit weigh two factors when deciding if a plaintiff has \ndemonstrated good cause under Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(m): “plaintiff's reasonable efforts to effect \nservice and the prejudice to the defendant from the delay.” John, 309 F.R.D. at 153 (quoting AIG \nManaged Mkt. Neutral Fund v. Askin Capital Mgmt., LP, 197 F.R.D. 104, 108 (S.D. N.Y. 2000); \nsee also Husowitz v. Am. Postal Workers Union, 190 F.R.D. 53, 57 (E.D.N.Y. 1999) (“The \n  8\n\nfollowing two factors are relevant in a Court's evaluation of good cause: (1) the reasonableness \nand diligence of plaintiff's efforts to serve; and (2) the prejudice to defendants from the delay.”). \nThe weighing of both factors result in the Court finding good cause. \n1.  Plaintiff’s Efforts at Service \nRadwan argues that she made reasonable efforts to adequately serve Tsantiris in his \nindividual capacity. See Pl. Resp. Br. at 5. She submitted an affidavit from a process server, \nstating that she had attempted to serve Tsantiris personally at his place of work before the \ndeadline had elapsed, but was informed that he was on vacation and would not return until three \ndays after the deadline for service under Rule 4(m) had passed. Affidavit of Michele \nVoneisdengrein (“Voneisdengrein Aff.”), Ex. A, Pl. Resp. Br. Once he returned, the process \nserver immediately returned to the office and provided service. Id. ¶ 5.  \nTsantiris argues that Conn Gen. Stat. “§ 52-57 permits abode service of a summons and \ncomplaint upon a defendant in his individual capacity.” Defs. Mem. at 13. Indeed, abode service \nis also one of ways to provide service under the Federal Rules as well. Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(e)(2). \nRadwan argues, however, that she was unable to determine where Tsantiris lived: \n“although abode service is allowed, the Plaintiff and her agent for service was unable to effect \nabode service on Defendant Tsantiris because they were unable to determine Defendant \nTsantiris’s place of abode.” Pl. Resp. Br. at 5. In the affidavit submitted along with Radwan’s \nbrief, the process server describes her methods for finding Tsantiris’s place of abode. See \nVoneisdengrein Aff. ¶¶  7-10. She states that she performed a Google search for his name and \nlooked for a personal social media account; upon finding none, she requested a “skip-trace on \nMr. Tsantiris.” Id. She reports, however, that she “was unable to ascertain Tsantiris’ home \naddress.” Id. \n  9\n\nGiven these efforts, the Court finds that Radwan made reasonable efforts to adequately \nserve Tsantiris before the period for service expired.  \n2.  Prejudice to Defendant \n  Radwan argues that “Defendants have not alleged that Defendant Tsantiris suffered any \nspecific harm or prejudice as a result of the three-day delay in service.” Pl. Resp. Br. at 7. The \nCourt agrees. \nDefendants do not address how Defendant Tsantiris would face prejudice directly and \ninstead argue that regularly granting discretionary extensions of time to effectuate service \n“would impose an unjust burden on the state. As it relates to suits against state employees in their \nofficial capacities, it would be difficult, if not impossible, for the state to keep track of suits \nagainst it if plaintiffs were allowed to choose their own method of service.” Defs. Mem. of Law \nat 14-15.  \nThis Court recognizes that “any defendant can make a generalized assertion that the \npassage of time associated with plaintiff's failure to serve will inhibit its ability to put on a \ndefense.” John, 309 F.R.D. at 155. Courts in this District, however, have required defendants to \ndemonstrate specifically how they have been prejudiced by a slight delay in service in assessing \nwhether a finding of good cause is warranted. See, e.g., Gashi v. Grubb & Ellis Prop. Mgmt. \nServs., Inc., No. 3:09-CV-1037 (JCH), 2010 WL 2977143, at *3 (D. Conn. July 21, 2010) \n(finding no prejudice to defendants for three-day delay and granting good cause extension); \nTaylor v. Alcohol & Drug Recovery Ctr., Inc., No. 3:10-CV-0319 RNC, 2011 WL 4368432, at \n*1 n.1 (D. Conn. July 27, 2011), report and recommendation adopted, No. 3:10-CV-319 RNC, \n2011 WL 4368696 (D. Conn. Sept. 19, 2011) (“Because the plaintiff reasonably relied on the \nU.S. Marshal and because there is no indication that the defendant was prejudiced by being \n  10\n\nserved five days late, there was good cause for the untimely service of process.”). As a result, \nTsantiris’s arguments here fall short of demonstrating any prejudice by the very slight delay in \nservice. \n3.  Extension of Time Nunc Pro Tunc \nWeighing both considerations, the Court finds that Radwan has demonstrated good cause \nfor the untimely service regarding Tsantiris. First, she made reasonable efforts to serve Tsantiris \nduring the time period provided by under the Federal Rules, once at his office and by \nunsuccessfully trying to ascertain his address. Second, the very brief delay in service makes it \nunlikely that Tsantiris would suffer prejudice, and Tsantiris has not identified any specific \nprejudice caused by this delay unique to his personal circumstances.  \nThe Court therefore will extend the period of time for service on Tsantiris nunc pro tunc \nto three days after the applicable 90-day period. Accordingly, Defendants’ motion to dismiss for \ninadequate service of process is denied.  \nCONCLUSION \n  Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss is GRANTED in part and DENIED in part.  \nCount I of the Complaint will proceed against Defendant UConn. Counts II through \nVI will proceed against Defendants Manuel, Tsantiris, and Lucas in their individual capacities \nonly. Any claims against Manuel, Tsantiris, and Lucas in their official capacities are dismissed, as \nare Counts V and VI with respect to Defendant UConn.  \nSO ORDERED at Bridgeport, Connecticut, this 14th day of December, 2017.   \n   /s/ Victor A.

CONCLUSION \nFootnotes \n \n*  The Clerk of the Court is respectfully instructed to amend the caption to conform with the above. \n \n \n**  Judge Eric R. Komitee, of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York, sitting by designation. \n \n \n1  The facts set forth below are drawn from the record on summary judgment before the district court. Any relevant \n  factual disputes are noted. \n \n2  Although the parties use “grant-in-aid,” “financial aid,” and athletic “scholarship” interchangeably, this opinion uses \n  the term “scholarship” to describe the financial assistance Radwan received for playing on the UConn women’s \nsoccer team. Moreover, because the parties interchangeably use the terms “cancellation” and “termination” as it \nrelates to Radwan’s athletic scholarship, this opinion does the same. \n \n3  According to UConn, Radwan was the only student-athlete at UConn reprimanded by the AAC from 2013 to October \n  2019. \n \n4  At the end of November 2014, Coach Tsantiris was recruiting high school players and was teased by other coaches \n  about  Radwan’s  behavior.  According  to  Coach  Tsantiris,  by  December,  he  had  concluded  that  Radwan  had \n“embarrass[ed] the program, the school, [and] the athletic department” and his “feeling was that we probably won’t \nkeep [Radwan] most likely.” Id. at 419. \n \n5  Fourteen business days from December 22, 2014 was January 13, 2015. Fourteen business days from December 24, \n26 \n \n\n \n \nRadwan v. Manuel, 55 F.4th 101 (2022)   \n \n \n  2014 was January 15, 2015. \n \n6  Radwan subsequently retained counsel who represented her in the district court. \n \n \n7  Radwan does not challenge the dismissal of these claims on appeal. The district court did not dismiss Radwan’s Title \n  IX claim against UConn or her Section 1983 and state law claims against the Individual Defendants in their individual \ncapacities.  In  the  remainder  of  this  opinion,  therefore,  for  ease  of  reference,  we  use  the  term  “Individual \nDefendants” to refer to the Individual Defendants solely in their individual capacities. \n \n8  The district court also granted summary judgment to the Individual Defendants on the equal protection claim, as \n  well as on the state law claims for breach of contract and negligent infliction of emotional distress. Id. at 101–05, \n114. On appeal, Radwan does not challenge the grant of summary judgment on those claims. \n \n9  We note that the district court granted summary judgment to FAD Lucas not on qualified immunity grounds, but \n  rather because of a lack of evidence of her personal involvement in the termination decision. 465 F. Supp. 3d at \n113–14. On appeal, Radwan does not specifically address the district court’s decision on the First Amendment claim \nas it relates to FAD Lucas and, thus, appears to have abandoned any challenge to the grant of summary judgment to \nFAD Lucas on this claim. See Norton v. Sam’s Club, 145 F.3d 114, 117 (2d Cir. 1998). In any event, we conclude that \nFAD Lucas is entitled to summary judgment on qualified immunity grounds for the same reasons as are Coach \nTsantiris and AD Manuel. \n \n10  We note that the Supreme Court’s recent decision in Kennedy v. Bremerton School District, ––– U.S. ––––, 142 S. Ct. \n  2407, 213 L.Ed.2d 755 (2022), which addressed the First Amendment rights of a coach while he remained on the \nfield after a football game, is inapposite to the circumstances here and provides no additional guidance for resolving \nthe constitutional issue presented in this case. In Kennedy, the Supreme Court held that a school district violated a \nhigh school football coach’s First Amendment rights by disciplining him for kneeling at midfield after games to pray \nquietly. Id. at 2433. The decision hinged upon the coach’s rights to religious exercises and expressive religious \nactivities under the First Amendment. Id. at 2421 (“Where the Free Exercise Clause protects religious exercises, \nwhether communicative or not, the Free Speech Clause provides overlapping protection for expressive religious \nactivities.”). Thus, the Supreme Court had no occasion to consider the contours of the First Amendment—in light of \nFraser, Hazelwood and their progeny—as it relates to a student-athlete engaging in vulgar or offensive expression \nwhile representing the team at a school-sponsored athletic event. \n \n11  Radwan notes that there is evidence in the record that she was disciplined because Coach Tsantiris and AD Manuel \n  found her gesture embarrassing. However, that is an oversimplification of the explanation by the decisionmakers for \nthe disciplinary sanction. For example, AD Manuel explained that Radwan’s gesture was not just “embarrassing” and \n“unnecessary,” but also “unsportsmanlike”: \nThat [gesture] is disrespectful to the competition that occurred. I didn’t get into her mind and her rationale. But it \n27 \n \n\n \n \nRadwan v. Manuel, 55 F.4th 101 (2022)   \n \n \nis unsportsmanlike in the sense that it’s disrespectful to the competition that you just engaged in[,] to yourself[,] \nand to the other team that participated with it. But at the time, I didn’t, you know, get into that sort of sense of \nunsportsmanlike because to me it was just more of a reflection of her, her team, this university. But in the general \nsense of how I see unsportsmanlike behavior, yeah, that is. \nJoint App’x at 384. Similarly, Coach Tsantiris testified that Radwan’s gesture was “devastating” because it brought \nthe focus on herself and her inappropriate behavior, rather than the team’s victory and its successful season. Id. at \n366; see also id. (“No other player in my then 34 years as UConn head coach had behaved this way. I felt that \nplaintiff’s behavior was a blow to the team, the program and UConn.”). \n \n12  To the extent the district court suggested that the qualified immunity analysis may hinge upon the specific fact that \n  the case “involv[ed] expressive conduct widely and publicly broadcast on national television, rather than limited to \nthe university setting,” Radwan, 465 F. Supp. 3d at 113, we do not view the amount of publicity to be the dispositive \nfactor in the qualified immunity analysis. \n \n13  In a footnote in her brief on appeal, Radwan suggests, for the first time, that UConn’s “serious misconduct” \n  standard, which was the basis for the revocation of her scholarship, is unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. \nAppellant’s Br. at 24 n.4. As a threshold matter, this argument is waived because it is raised before this Court only in \na cursory, one-sentence footnote. See Tolbert v. Queens Coll., 242 F.3d 58, 75 (2d Cir. 2001). In addition, we decline \nto consider this argument because it was not raised before the district court. See Otal Invs. Ltd. v. M/V CLARY, 673 \nF.3d 108, 120 (2d Cir. 2012). \n \n14  The policies weighing in favor of considering the merits of the “property interest” issue were absent from Radwan’s \n  First Amendment claim or the adequacy of the particular procedures utilized by UConn in connection with Radwan’s \ndue process claim. Both of those issues would require an expenditure of substantial judicial resources to address \nand, in contrast to the “property interest” question, are extremely fact-specific determinations that would be of \nlimited value to public officials and future litigants in First Amendment or procedural due process cases involving \nuniversities. See Evans v. Skolnik, 997 F.3d 1060, 1065 (9th Cir. 2021) (noting that, although addressing the merits “ \n‘is intended to further the development of constitutional precedent, opinions following that procedure often fail to \nmake  a  meaningful  contribution  to  such  development,’  particularly  where  the  constitutional  question  is ‘so \nfactbound that the decision provides little guidance for future cases.’ ” (quoting Pearson, 555 U.S. at 237, 129 S.Ct. \n808)); see also Coollick v. Hughes, 699 F.3d 211, 219–20 (2d Cir. 2012) (emphasizing that we “have discretion to \ndecide which of the two prongs of qualified-immunity analysis to tackle first” and noting that “[d]eciding a case \nunder prong two saves scarce judicial resources by avoiding unnecessary decisions” and “may also be preferable” \nwhen “our deciding the case under prong one could create a risk of bad decisionmaking” (internal quotation marks \nomitted)). \n \n15  For example, Radwan’s financial aid agreement states that her financial aid award “will not be increased, reduced or \n  canceled during the period of its award on the basis of [her] athletics ability, performance or contribution to the \nteam’s success, because of injury or illness that prevents [her] from participating in athletics, or for any other \nathletics reason,” but instead, only for a violation of certain terms, including for “serious misconduct that brings \nsubstantial disciplinary penalty.” Joint App’x at 58–59; see also id. at 82 (“Once a grant-in-aid is awarded, the \nUniversity is committed to fulfilling its financial obligation to you until your eligibility is exhausted. However, please \n28 \n \n\n \n \nRadwan v. Manuel, 55 F.4th 101 (2022)   \n \n \nremember that athletics grants are one-year, renewable awards. Grants-in-aid may be canceled or reduced during \nthe period of the award” only for certain enumerated violations). \n \n16  Further, Coach Tsantiris’s recommendation that Radwan attend community college classes in lieu of returning to \n  UConn suggests that he knew the extent to which she relied upon her scholarship, and knew also that she would \nhave been unable to remain at UConn without it. \n \n17  Of note, only two percent of high school athletes nationwide are granted athletic scholarships, let alone full \n  scholarships,  to  compete  in  college.  Scholarships,  NAT’L  COLLEGIATE  ATHLETIC  ASS’N, \nhttp://www.ncaa.org/student-athletes/future/scholarships (last visited September 1, 2022). \n \n18  Further, we reject the Individual Defendants’ suggestion that a term length of only one year could not give rise to a \n  property interest, as property interests are defined not only by length, but also by their protection under state law \nand the plaintiff’s reliance upon them. See Ezekwo, 940 F.2d at 783 (finding a protected property interest in a \nfour-month position); Taravella, 599 F.3d at 134 (finding a protected property interest in a one-year position). \n \n19  The Student-Athlete Handbook prohibits unsportsmanlike behavior including, but not limited to, “[u]sing obscene or \n  inappropriate language or gestures to officials, opponents, team members or spectators” or “[t]hrowing of objects \nat individuals, spectators or across a field or arena.” Joint App’x at 73. \n \n20  One of the amicus briefs filed in support of Radwan notes that Adams’s misconduct occurred during a football game \n  that, like Radwan’s game, was nationally televised. See Legal Momentum Br. at 22 (citing a press release by \nBYU—UConn’s  opponent—reporting  that  ESPN  and  ESPN2  would  televise  the  game  during  which  Adams’s \nmisconduct occurred). However, because this asserted fact is outside the record, we do not consider it here. \n \n21  Radwan also cites other incidents at UConn involving male student-athletes after AD Manuel was replaced as \n  Athletic Director in March 2016. For example, in September 2016, a member of the UConn football team on a full \nathletic scholarship became involved in a physical altercation at an off-campus party. The UConn Office of \nCommunity Standards, after an administrative hearing, determined that the student had violated various provisions \nof the Student Code and imposed a sanction of University probation, as well as required completion of an \neducational project. In addition, in October 2016, another member of the UConn football team on a full athletic \nscholarship was arrested for allegedly being in possession of marijuana, alcohol while a minor, and a facsimile BB \ngun. After determining that he had violated several provisions of the Student Code, the UConn Office of Community \nStandards likewise imposed a sanction of University probation and required participation in an educational wellness \nprogram. The scholarship of neither male student-athlete was adversely affected by the findings of having violated \nthe Student Code, nor did the men’s football head coach recommend that the students’ scholarships be cancelled. \nWe need not, however, evaluate these additional incidents because we conclude that the evidence regarding the \nother comparators, discussed above, is sufficient to raise issues of fact that preclude summary judgment on this \n29 \n \n\n \n \nRadwan v. Manuel, 55 F.4th 101 (2022)   \n \n \nissue. \n \n22  As one of these amicus briefs notes, out of UConn’s eighteen sports teams, only four of them have shared coaches \n  for male and female student-athletes and accordingly, a same-supervisor requirement would mean that “student \nathletes on at least fourteen teams ... could never point to a legally sufficient comparator, no matter how egregious \nthe discrimination.” Legal Momentum Br. at 23. Moreover, because “eight single-sex teams at UConn do not have a \ncorresponding team of the opposite sex,” under a rule requiring comparators to participate in the same sport, \n“nearly 50% of student-athletes at UConn would be unable to point to a legally sufficient comparator.” Id. at 24. \n \n23  In reaching its conclusion to the contrary, the district court relied heavily on the Sixth Circuit’s unpublished decision \n  in Heike, 519 F. App’x 911, which held that “[t]o be similarly situated, a player must have dealt with the same \n[coach],  have  been  subject  to  the  same  standards,  and  have  engaged  in  the  same  conduct  without  such \ndifferentiating or mitigating circumstances that would distinguish their conduct or their employer’s treatment of \nthem for it.” Id. at 920 (internal quotation marks and emphasis omitted). As a threshold matter, we note that Heike \ndid not involve Title IX, but rather concerned a claim of race discrimination under the Equal Protection Clause as it \nrelated to the renewal of athletic scholarships. Id. at 916–17. Furthermore, the language on this issue cited in Heike \nis from Ercegovich v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., 154 F.3d 344 (6th Cir. 1998), which specifically stated that \n“[c]ourts  should  not  assume  ...  that  [these]  factors  ...  are  relevant  factors  in  cases  arising  under  different \ncircumstances, but should make an independent determination as to the relevancy of” those factors in the specific \nfactual context. Id. at 352. In any event, to the extent the summary order in Heike could be viewed as embracing a \ncategorical “same decisionmaker rule,” we decline to follow that rule for the reasons stated herein. \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n30 \n ",

The spreadsheet in the record, however, does not indicate the gender of the students disciplined. \nMs. Radwan’s counsel conceded during the hearing on April 30, 2020, however, that the spreadsheet contains both \nmen and women. Additionally, counsel for UConn represented at the hearing that the spreadsheet only reflects \ndisciplinary actions taken against student-athletes involving the UConn Office of Community Standards, but does not \nreflect disciplinary actions taken solely within UConn’s Athletics Department, such as Ms. Radwan’s, an assertion not \ndisputed by Plaintiff’s counsel. For all of these reasons, to the extent the information provided in the spreadsheet is \neven relevant, it is not probative of Ms. Radwan’s gender discrimination claim. \n \n2  See Goldberg v.
