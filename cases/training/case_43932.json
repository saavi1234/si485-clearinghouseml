    "summary": "<p>This is a case about voting rights in Georgia. This lawsuit was filed on November 6, 2019, in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia. The plaintiffs were the Democratic Party of Georgia, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, all represented by private law firms. They sued Georgia under 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1983, alleging that the procedures by which the state evaluated and rejected mail-in ballots infringed on the constitutional rights of voters. The plaintiffs sought declaratory relief, preliminary and permanent injunctions, and costs and attorney's fees. Judge William M. Ray, II was assigned to the case.</p>\r\n<p>In their original complaint, filed on November 6, 2019, the plaintiffs alleged that due to a vague state law, election officials across different Georgia counties had different methods and timelines for telling voters if a mail-in ballot had a problem that needed to be corrected, and these county-by-county differences could make voters more or less likely to be able to fix their ballots. Furthermore, sometimes a multi-day delay before notification would make it impractical or impossible for voters to fix the problem with their ballot before the election deadline. The plaintiffs also argued that the particular mail-in ballot envelope used by Gwinnett County, in particular, led to excess rejections because of its bad design and too-small font. Additionally, the plaintiffs argued that these mail-in ballot issues disproportionately deprived people of color of their voting rights.</p>\r\n<p>In an amended complaint, filed over a month later on December 27, 2019, the plaintiffs added a challenge to the mail-in ballot signature comparison procedures. State law required election officials to judge whether the signature on someone's ballot matched their recorded signature, but the state did not set out procedures for how to compare signatures or create training requirements for officials, nor did it establish an oversight process for rejections, meaning that officials were making overly discretionary judgments and they were likely rejecting valid signatures. The plaintiffs also argued that incorrect signature rejections would disproportionately harm people of color, young voters, people with disabilities, senior citizens, and people who need others to help them fill in their signature.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs alleged several constitutional violations. They argued that the inconsistency between counties, both in terms of the signature comparisons and the notifications, amounted to disparate treatment and therefore violated the Equal Protection Clause. They also alleged that the signature comparison, the notification inconsistencies, and Gwinnett's bad ballot design put an undue burden on people's voting rights and therefore violated the First and Fourteenth Amendments. Finally, they argued that the delays in notifying people about ballot rejections infringed on people's procedural due process rights.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs asked the court to declare that these state election laws and practices were unconstitutional, and to impose a one-day notification requirement for ballot rejections. They also asked for preliminary and permanent injunctions to stop the rejection of ballots based on signature comparisons, and to change Gwinnett County's bad envelope design. Finally, they asked for costs and attorney's fees.</p>\r\n<p>The Gwinnett County defendants filed a motion to dismiss the first complaint on December 23, 2019, and a motion to dismiss the amended complaint on January 10 of the following year. They argued that the plaintiffs lacked standing to sue the county, that the issue went beyond the authority of the federal courts, and that the issue was not ripe for adjudication.</p>\r\n<p>The state defendants moved to dismiss the amended complaint a few weeks later, on January 31, 2020, for lack of standing, failure to state a claim, and mootness. The state contended that the allegations about vague ballot notification rules were moot because on January 22, about a week before filing the motion, the State Election Board had put out a new rule establishing specific statewide notification procedures. The State had also proposed another rule change that would require even more comprehensive notification from officials about rejected ballots.</p>\r\n<p>On January 1, 2020, the court placed a stay on the case; the stay was later extended through March 6 of the same year. During this stay, on February 28, Georgia's State Election Board approved a rule change that established heightened statewide notification procedures about rejected ballots, requiring mail notification in three business days--or one business day as Election Day got closer--as well as email and phone notification if possible.</p>\r\n<p>The parties settled on March 6, 2020. The settlement agreement with Georgia required the state to implement the February 28 rule about notifications. It also established signature matching rules, including mandating that several officials vote on signature rejections. The agreement with Gwinnett County included a change to its ballot envelope design.</p>\r\n<p>Five days later, the plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed their claims against Gwinnett County. About two weeks later they also dismissed their claims against Georgia. The case was closed on March 23, 2020.</p>",

The parties \nto this Agreement may be referred to individually as a โPartyโ or collectively as the \nโParties.โ  The Agreement will take effect when each and every Party has signed it, \nas of the date of the last signature (the โEffective Dateโ). \n \nWHEREAS, in the lawsuit styled as Democratic Party of Georgia, et al. v. \nRaffensperger, et al., Civil Action File No. 1:19-cv-5028-WMR (the โLawsuitโ), the \nPolitical Party Committees have asserted claims in their Amended Complaint [Doc. \n30] that the State Defendantsโ (i) absentee ballot signature matching procedure, (ii) \nnotification  process  when  an  absentee  ballot  is  rejected  for  any  reason,  and  \n(iii) procedure for curing a rejected absentee ballot, violate the First and Fourteenth \nAmendments to the United States Constitution by unduly burdening the right to vote, \nsubjecting similarly situated voters to disparate treatment, and failing to afford \nGeorgia voters due process (the โClaimsโ), which the State Defendants deny; \n \nWHEREAS, the State Defendants, in their capacity as members of the State \nElection Board, adopted on February 28, 2020 Rule 183-1-14-.13, which sets forth \nspecific and standard notification procedures that all counties must follow after \nrejection of a timely mail-in absentee ballot; \n \nWHEREAS,  the  State  Defendants  have  a  Motion  to  Dismiss  [Doc.  45] \npending before the Court, which sets forth various grounds for dismissal of the \nAmended Complaint, including mootness in light of the State Election Boardโs \npromulgation subsequent to adoption on February 28, 2020 of Rule 183-1-14-.13, \nwhich Motion the Political Party Committees deny is meritorious; \n \nWHEREAS, all Parties desire to compromise and settle all disputed issues \nand claims arising from the Lawsuit, finally and fully, without admission of liability, \nhaving agreed on the procedures and guidance set forth below with respect to the \nsignature matching and absentee ballot rejection notification and cure procedures; \nand \n \nWHEREAS, by entering into this Agreement, the Political Party Committees \ndo not concede that the challenged laws and procedures are constitutional, and \n   \n\nCase 1:19-cv-05028-WMR   Document 56-1   Filed 03/06/20   Page 3 of 7\nsimilarly,  the  State  Defendants  do  not  concede  that  the  challenged  laws  and \nprocedures are unconstitutional.  \n \nNOW THEREFORE, for and in consideration of the promises and covenants \ncontained  herein,  and  other  good  and  valuable  consideration,  the  receipt  and \nsufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the Parties do hereby agree as follows: \n \n1.  Dismissal.  Within five (5) business days of March 22, 2020, the \neffective date of the Prompt Notification of Absentee Ballot Rejection rule specified \nin paragraph 2(a), the Political Party Committees shall dismiss the Lawsuit with \nprejudice as to the State Defendants.   \n \n2.  Prompt Notification of Absentee Ballot Rejection.   \n \n(a)  The State Defendants, in their capacity as members of the State Election \nBoard,  agree  to  promulgate  and  enforce,  in  accordance  with  the  Georgia \nAdministrative Procedures Act and State Election Board policy, the following State \nElection Board Rule 183-1-14-.13 of the Georgia Rules and Regulations: \n \nWhen  a  timely  submitted  absentee  ballot  is  rejected,  the  board  of \nregistrars or absentee ballot clerk shall send the elector notice of such \nrejection and opportunity to cure, as provided by O.C.G.A. ยง 21-2-386, \nby mailing written notice, and attempt to notify the elector by telephone \nand email if a telephone number or email is on the electorโs voter \nregistration record, no later than the close of business on the third \nbusiness day after receiving the absentee ballot. However, for any \ntimely submitted absentee ballot that is rejected on or after the second \nFriday prior to Election Day, the board of registrars or absentee ballot \nclerk shall send the elector notice of such rejection and opportunity to \ncure, as provided by O.C.G.A. ยง 21-2-386, by mailing written notice, \nand attempt to notify the elector by telephone and email if a telephone \nnumber or email is on the electorโs voter registration record, no later \nthan close of business on the next business day.  \n \nGa. R. & Reg. ยง 183-1-14-.13 Prompt Notification of Absentee Ballot \nRejection \n \n(b)  Unless otherwise required by law, State Defendants agree that any \namendments to Rule 183-1-14-.13 will be made in good faith in the spirit of ensuring \nthat voters are notified of rejection of their absentee ballots with ample time to cure \n  2 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-05028-WMR   Document 56-1   Filed 03/06/20   Page 4 of 7\ntheir ballots.  The Political Party Committees agree that the State Election Boardโs \nproposed amendment to Rule 183-1-14-.13 to use contact information on absentee \nballot applications  to notify the voter fits within that spirit. \n \n3.  Signature Match.   \n \n(a)  Secretary of State Raffensperger, in his official capacity as Secretary of \nState,  agrees  to  issue  an  Official  Election  Bulletin  containing  the  following \nprocedure applicable to the review of signatures on absentee ballot envelopes by \ncounty  elections  officials  and  to  incorporate  the  procedure  below  in  training \nmaterials regarding the review of absentee ballot signatures for county registrars:     \n \nCounty registrars and absentee ballot clerks are required, upon receipt \nof each mail-in absentee ballot, to compare the signature or mark of the \nelector on the mail-in absentee ballot envelope with the signatures or \nmarks in eNet and on the application for the mail-in absentee ballot.  If \nthe signature does not appear to be valid, registrars and clerks are \nrequired  to  follow  the  procedure  set  forth  in  O.C.G.A.  ยง  21-2-\n386(a)(1)(C).  When reviewing an electorโs signature on the mail-in \nabsentee  ballot  envelope,  the  registrar  or  clerk  must  compare  the \nsignature on the mail-in absentee ballot envelope to each signature \ncontained in such electorโs voter registration record in eNet and the \nelectorโs signature on the application for the mail-in absentee ballot.  If \nthe  registrar  or  absentee  ballot  clerk  determines  that  the  voterโs \nsignature on the mail-in absentee ballot envelope does not match any \nof the voterโs signatures on  file in  eNet  or on the  absentee  ballot \napplication, the registrar or absentee ballot clerk must seek review from \ntwo other registrars, deputy registrars, or absentee ballot clerks. A mail-\nin  absentee  ballot  shall  not  be  rejected  unless  a  majority  of  the \nregistrars, deputy registrars, or absentee ballot clerks reviewing the \nsignature agree that the signature does not match any of the voterโs \nsignatures on file in eNet or on the absentee ballot application. If a \ndetermination  is  made  that  the  electorโs  signature  on  the  mail-in \nabsentee ballot envelope does not match any of the voterโs signatures \non file in eNet or on the absentee ballot application, the registrar or \nabsentee  ballot  clerk  shall  write  the  names  of  the  three  elections \nofficials who conducted the signature review across the face of the \nabsentee  ballot  envelope,  which  shall  be  in  addition  to  writing \nโRejectedโ and the reason for the rejection as required under OCGA \n21-2-386(a)(1)(C). Then, the registrar or absentee ballot clerk shall \n  3 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-05028-WMR   Document 56-1   Filed 03/06/20   Page 5 of 7\ncommence the notification procedure set forth in O.C.G.A. ยง 21-2-\n386(a)(1)(C) and State Election Board Rule 183-1-14-.13. \n \n(b)  The Parties agree that the guidance in paragraph 3(a) shall be issued in \nadvance of all statewide elections in 2020, including the March 24, 2020 Presidential \nPrimary Elections and the November 3, 2020 General Election. \n \n4.    Consideration of Additional Guidance for Signature Matching. \nThe State Defendants agree to consider in good faith providing county registrars and \nabsentee ballot clerks with additional guidance and training materials to follow when \ncomparing votersโ signatures that will be drafted by the Political Party Committeesโ \nhandwriting and signature review expert. \n \n5.  Attorneysโ Fees and Expenses.  The Parties to this Agreement shall \nbear their own attorneyโs fees and costs incurred in bringing or defending this action, \nand no party shall be considered to be a prevailing party for the purpose of any law, \nstatute, or regulation providing for the award or recovery of attorneyโs fees and/or \ncosts. \n \n6.  Release by The Political Party Committees.  The Political Party \nCommittees,  on  behalf  of  themselves  and  their  successors,  affiliates,  and \nrepresentatives, release and forever discharge the State Defendants, and each of their \nsuccessors  and  representatives,  from  the  prompt  notification  of  absentee  ballot \nrejection and signature match claims and causes of action, whether legal or equitable, \nin the Lawsuit. \n \n7.  No Admission of Liability.  It is understood and agreed by the Parties \nthat this Agreement is a compromise and is being executed to settle a dispute.  \nNothing contained herein may be construed as an admission of liability on the part \nof any of the Parties. \n \n8.  Authority to Bind; No Prior Assignment of Released Claims.  The \nParties  represent  and  warrant  that  they  have  full  authority  to  enter  into  this \nAgreement and bind themselves to its terms. \n \n9.  No Presumptions.  The Parties acknowledge that they have had input \ninto the drafting of this Agreement or, alternatively, have had an opportunity to have \ninput into the drafting of this Agreement.  The Parties agree that this Agreement is \nand shall be deemed jointly drafted and written by all Parties to it, and it shall be \ninterpreted fairly, reasonably, and not more strongly against one Party than the other.  \n  4 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-05028-WMR   Document 56-1   Filed 03/06/20   Page 6 of 7\nAccordingly, if a dispute arises about the meaning, construction, or interpretation of \nthis  Agreement,  no  presumption  will  apply  to  construe  the  language  of  this \nAgreement for or against any Party. \n \n10.  Knowing and Voluntary Agreement.  Each Party to this Agreement \nacknowledges that it is entering into this Agreement voluntarily and of its own free \nwill and accord, and seeks to be bound hereunder.  The Parties further acknowledge \nthat they have retained their own legal counsel in this matter or have had the \nopportunity to retain legal counsel to review this Agreement.   \n \n11.  Choice of Law, Jurisdiction and Venue.  This Agreement will be \nconstrued in accordance with the laws of the State of Georgia.  In the event of any \ndispute arising out of or in any way related to this Agreement, the Parties consent to \nthe sole and exclusive jurisdiction of the state courts located in Fulton County, \nGeorgia.  The Parties waive any objection to jurisdiction and venue of those courts.   \n \n12.  Entire Agreement; Modification. This Agreement sets forth the entire \nagreement between the Parties hereto, and fully supersedes any prior agreements or \nunderstandings between the Parties.  The Parties acknowledge that they have not \nrelied on any representations, promises, or agreements of any kind made to them in \nconnection with their decision to accept this Agreement, except for those set forth in \nthis Agreement. \n \n13.

Based \nupon information and belief, Plaintiffs allege as follows:\nNATURE OF THE CASE \n1. โNo right is more precious in a free country than that of having a voice \nin the election of those who make the laws under which, as good citizens, we must \nlive. Other rights, even the most basic, are illusory if the right to vote is undermined.โ \nWesberry v. Sanders, 376 U.S. 1, 17 (1964). Plaintiffs bring this lawsuit to protect \nthis right and to prevent the disenfranchisement of Georgia voters whose absentee \nby-mail  (โabsenteeโ)  ballots  have  been  rejected  for  missing  or  mismatched \n- 2 -\n\nCase 1:19-cv-05028-WMR   Document 30   Filed 12/27/19   Page 3 of 51\nsignatures. The cause of this disenfranchisement is two-fold. First, voters harmed \nby Georgiaโsstandardlessand unreliablesignature matching procedure, under which \nuntrained county election officials acting without any state guidance are required to \ncomparevotersโ signatures onabsentee ballotsand reject ballotswhere they perceive\na signature mismatch.Second, they are harmed by Georgiaโs standardless procedure \nfor notifying absentee voters that their signatures are either missing or mismatched,\nwhich fails to provide Georgia voters with a meaningful ability to cure their ballots \nwithin  the  prescribed  timeframe.  These  deficient  procedures disproportionately \nimpact African-American  and  other  minority  voters and have a  particularly \ndetrimental impact on minorityvoters in Gwinnett County, who are further burdened \nby Gwinnett Countyโs poorly designed, confusing absentee ballot envelope, which \nplaces these voters at a heightened risk of returning an absentee ballot without \nproperly completing the signature requirement. Because of Georgiaโs standardless \nsignature match and notifications procedures, and Gwinnett Countyโs confusing \nabsentee ballot envelope design, hundreds of Georgia votersโ absentee ballots have \ngone uncounted, and hundreds more face the same fate in the 2020 election without \nintervention from this Court.\n2. Absentee voting is extraordinarily popular among Georgia voters \nand has grown in popularity over time. Applications for absentee ballots surged \n- 3 -\n\nCase 1:19-cv-05028-WMR   Document 30   Filed 12/27/19   Page 4 of 51\nin  advance  of  the  2018  general  elections,  with  over 281,000 Georgia voters \nrequesting absentee ballots. And, despite the fact that turnout has historically been \nlower  in  midterm  elections  than  in  presidential  elections,  the  total  number  of \nreturned  absentee ballots  in  the  2018  midterm  electionโธบnearly  284,393โธบwas \ngreater than the number cast in the 2016 presidential election, 246,621.\n3. Georgia also routinely rejects a significant number of absentee ballots.\nOf the combined 531,014 absentee ballots cast in the past two general elections,\n6,681 have been rejected for technical reasons wholly unrelated to the voterโs \nqualifications, including failing to signthe oath on the back of the absentee ballot \nenvelope or having a mismatched signature. During the 2016 general election, \nGeorgia County Election Officials rejected 580 absentee ballots for missing or \ninaccurate oath information, including missing and mismatched signatures, 145\nand  435, respectively.  And,  in  the  2018  general  election,  County  Election \nOfficials rejected 454ballots for the same reasons, rejecting227 absentee ballots \nfor each. One countyโGwinnettโrejected far more absentee ballots, 118, for\nmissing  or  mismatched signatures than  any  other  county,  103  and  15,\nrespectively.\n4. The number of absentee ballots rejected for a missing or mismatched\nsignature is significant, especially when evaluated in context. Saucedo v. Gardner, \n- 4 -\n\nCase 1:19-cv-05028-WMR   Document 30   Filed 12/27/19   Page 5 of 51\n335 F. Supp. 3d 202, 217 (D.N.H. 2018) (โ[t]he overall rates of rejection due to a \nsignature mismatch have been low in recent general elections. But those rates should \nbe put into perspective.โ).Recently, elections in Georgia have been decided by small \nmargins. For example, the Democratic candidate in the 2018 gubernatorial race, who \nreceived a substantial majority of the votes cast by absentee ballots (137,616 out of \nthe 223,576  absentee ballots  cast),  lost by  under 55,000 votes (1.3  percentage \npoints). And in an even closer race, the Democratic candidate for Georgiaโs 7th \nCongressional  District  for  the  U.S.  House  of  Representatives,  who  received \n57 percent of the absentee ballot votes (10,466 out of 18,217 absentee ballots cast), \nlost  by  just  419  votes (.14  percentage  points).  Georgiaโs  arbitrary  rejection  of \nabsentee ballots not only disenfranchises individual voters, but it also leads to \nelection results that may not reflect the will and intent of Georgiaโs electorate.  \n5. Because such a significant number of absentee ballots have been \nrejected in Georgia, the State has seen a flood of litigation since the 2018 general \nelection aimed at ending the disenfranchisement caused by the absentee voting\nregime. In a series of opinions, courts in this district have repeatedly found that \noutright rejection of absentee ballots for missing or inaccurate oath information \nviolates the U.S. Constitution and the Civil Rights Act, 52 U.S.C. ยง 10101(a)(2)(B). \nSee Democratic Party of Ga., Inc. v. Crittenden, 347 F. Supp. 3d 1324 (N.D. Ga. \n- 5 -\n\nCase 1:19-cv-05028-WMR   Document 30   Filed 12/27/19   Page 6 of 51\n2018); Martin v. Crittenden, 347 F. Supp. 3d 1302 (N.D. Ga. 2018);Martin v. Kemp, \n341 F. Supp. 3d 1326 (N.D. Ga. 2018).\n6. As a result, the Georgia General Assembly amended the absentee \nvoting scheme in an attempt to prevent absentee ballots from being rejected for \ntechnical reasons, including for missing or mismatched signatures. Specifically, \nthe General Assembly modified the language of the oath on the absentee ballot \nenvelope to remove requests for certain technical information. And, adding to \nthe existing requirement that election officials โpromptly notifyโ the voter of a\nmissing or mismatched signature, it required that election officials give a voter \nuntil three days after the date of the election to cure a signature before rejecting\nan absentee  ballot for  a  missing  or  mismatched  signature. Id. at  ยงยง  21-2-\n386(a)(1)(C), -419(c).\n7. These reforms, however, do not remedy the flaws in Georgiaโs \nabsentee ballot regime and will not end the unconstitutional disenfranchisement \nof voters. Most glaringly, the law still does not provide any timeliness standard \nfor election officials to โpromptlyโ notify voters of missing or mismatched \nsignatures; nor does it provide any standard for the form of notice required.\n8. As a result, counties interpret โpromptโ notice differently and use \ninconsistent methods to inform voters of the need to cure their absentee ballots. \n- 6 -\n\nCase 1:19-cv-05028-WMR   Document 30   Filed 12/27/19   Page 7 of 51\nFor example, some counties send letters by first-class mail, while others call or \nemail voters. And some counties provide notification up to three days after \nidentifying  the  missing or  mismatched signature.  Such  an  interpretation  is \nproblematic  for  voters  whose  absentee ballots  are  submitted on  or  close  to \nelection day, as they are sent letters three days later and are not notified with \nsufficient  time  to  cure  during  the  three-day  post-election period.  Thus, \ndepending on where the voter lives, she may not receive notice in time to cure \nand her ballot will be rejected outright, directly contrary to the U.S. Constitution \nand the rulings of courts in this district. \n9. And County Election Officials are left to their own devices when \ndetermining whether a signature matches on an absentee ballot in the first place, \nas the law wholly lacks any standards for election officials to follow when \ncomparing signatures, fails to require any training in signature examination, and \nis not supported by any significant oversight to monitor signature match errors \nand prevent the disenfranchisement of eligible, qualified voters. \n10. Indeed, studies have shown that signature matching conducted by \nlaypersons results in a high rate of error that skews toward the over-rejection of \nlegitimate signatures. This high risk of error, combined with the absence of any \nuniform standards or criteria for signature matching, all but ensures unlawful \n- 7 -\n\nCase 1:19-cv-05028-WMR   Document 30   Filed 12/27/19   Page 8 of 51\ndisenfranchisement of absentee voters, and creates a regime in which the fate of \nan absentee ballot often depends on whichever arbitrary standard is employed \nby the county in which the voter resides, or the specific County Election Official \ncharged with reviewing the voterโs signatures.\n11. Without a uniform standard for the timing for election officials to \nprovide notice to voters about missing or mismatched signatures or the method \nof notification or without standard procedures and training for determining a \nsignature match, practices will continue to vary widely across the state, with\neach of Georgiaโs 159 counties establishing its own deadline and method for \nnotification  as  well  as  its  own  standardless  and  untrained  determination  of\nsignature matching. This hodgepodge approach unduly burdens absentee votersโ\nright to vote. \n12. These burdens are exacerbated in Gwinnett County, whose high \nvolume  of  absentee  ballots  with missing  or  mismatched signatures  and \ncorresponding  high  rejection  rate is  tied  not  only  to  Georgiaโs  standardless \nsignature-matching and notification procedures, but directly to theconfusingand\nopaque design of its absentee ballot envelope, which often prevents voters from \neven realizing that their signatures are required. Because Gwinnett County must \ninclude the oath in both English and Spanish on the envelope, it uses small, \n- 8 -\n\nCase 1:19-cv-05028-WMR   Document 30   Filed 12/27/19   Page 9 of 51\nnearly illegible type in approximately 6.5-point font.1 By way of example, \nthis text is in \n. \nsize 6.5-point font\n13. Given the deficient design of the Gwinnett County absentee ballot \nenvelope, the county rejected more absentee ballots for missing or mismatched\nsignatures than any other county during the 2018 general election (118 of the \n454 rejected ballots). The recent changes to the language in the oath on the ballot \nenvelope do not address the design flaws; Gwinnett Countyโs absentee ballot \nenvelope  remains  lengthy  and  cramped,  and  voters  will  continue  to  find  it \nindiscernible.  As  such, Gwinnett  Countyโs  absentee  ballot  envelope  design, \ncoupled with the Countyโs arbitrary signature match process and inadequate \nnotification procedures under Georgiaโs standardless notification system, will \ncontinue to create an unusually high risk that voters who vote absentee will have \ntheir votes ultimately rejected for missing or mismatched signatures and be \ndisenfranchised.\n14. Additionally,  the  continued  rejection  of  absentee  ballots  for \nmismatched  or  missing  signatures  will  have  a  disproportionate  effect  on \n                                                \n1 Bureau of the Census, Department of Commerce, Voting Rights Act Amendments of 2006, \nDeterminations  Under  Section  203,  81  Fed.

African-American and \nLatino voters  make  up  over  35 percent  of  Gwinnett  Countyโs  active  voting \npopulation, and they accounted for 49 percent of rejected absentee ballots during the \n2018 general election. \n15. Absent judicial intervention, voters who submit absentee ballots in \nGwinnett County and other areas of the state will continue to have their votes \nthrown  out in  future  elections  due  to the  arbitrary, unreliable  procedure  for \ncomparing signatures in violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the \nU.S. Constitution, and due to the standardless procedure for notifying voters of \nmissing or mismatched signatures in clear violation of the Due Process and Equal \nProtection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. Absentee voters in Gwinnett \nCounty  will  have  their  right  to  vote  further  burdened  by  the  Countyโs  poorly \ndesigned ballot envelope in violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments.\nJURISDICTION AND VENUE\n16.

Plaintiff DEMOCRATIC PARTY OF GEORGIA, INC., (โDPGโ)\nis a state committee, as defined by 52 U.S.C. ยง 30101(15), dedicated to electing \ncandidates of the Democratic Party to public office throughout the State of \nGeorgia. DPG has members and constituents from across Georgia, including \nmany eligible voters who regularly support and vote for candidates affiliated \nwith the Democratic Party. As discussed infra, members and constituents of the \nDemocratic Party risk having their right to vote burdened and/or denied due to \n- 11 -\n\nCase 1:19-cv-05028-WMR   Document 30   Filed 12/27/19   Page 12 of 51\nthe absentee voting scheme. DPG brings these claims on their behalf, as well as \nin its own right.\n22. DPG is  directly  harmed  by  the  Georgiaโs  standardless  absentee\nsignature  matching and notification  processes and  Gwinnett  Countyโs  deficient\nabsentee ballot envelope because each frustrates its mission and efforts to elect \nDemocratic Party candidates in Georgia, undermining DPGโs efforts to successfully\nhelp elect Democratic candidates to office. In recent elections, for example, absentee \nvoters have disproportionately voted for Democratic candidates. For example, in the \n2018 general election, the majority of absentee voters supported the Democratic \ncandidate for governor (137,616 out of the 223,576 absentee ballots castโor 61.5 \npercent). Thus,  Georgiaโs  standardless  signature  matching  and  notification \nprocedures and  Gwinnett  Countyโs  absentee  ballot  envelope  design \ndisproportionately impacts and undermines DPGโs efforts to successfully help elect \ncandidates of the Democratic Party to office.\n23. Further, as part of DPGโs get-out-the-vote efforts, it engages in a robust \nabsenteevoter contact programdesigned to: (i) informthousands of voters statewide \nof their ability to cast absentee ballots; (ii) explain the rules and deadlines governing \nvote by mail; and (iii) encourage voters to utilize vote by mail. Georgiaโs laws \nregarding missing and mismatched signatures decrease overall confidence in the \n- 12 -\n\nCase 1:19-cv-05028-WMR   Document 30   Filed 12/27/19   Page 13 of 51\nabsentee voting processes, and Georgiaโs voting scheme generally, thereby directly \nundermining the efforts of DPG to encourage voters to utilize absentee ballots and \nto assist them in exercising their right to vote.Because of Georgiaโs flawed absentee \nvoting notification  procedure  and  Gwinnett  Countyโs  deficient  absentee  ballot\nenvelope design, DPG will have to divert resources to provide support for voters to \nhelp them avoid disenfranchisement and overcome the burdens they face as a result \nof  these  flawed  laws,  procedures,  and  absentee  voting  materialsโธบresources  it \notherwise would use to educate voters about issues and individual candidates.\n24. Plaintiff DSCC is a Democratic political committee established and \nmaintained by a national political party, as defined by and used in 11 C.F.R. ยง \n110.2(c)(2)(iii) and provided for in 52 U.S.C. ยง 30116(h). DSCCโs mission is to \nelect candidates of the Democratic Party to the U.S. Senate, including in Georgia, \nwhere  there  will  be  a  competitive  Senate  election  in 2020. DSCC  works  to \naccomplish  its  mission  by,  among  other  things,  contributing  money  to \nDemocratic  candidates  for  U.S.  Senate,  making  expenditures  on  behalf  of \nDemocratic candidates for U.S. Senate, and assisting state parties throughout the \ncountry,  including  in  Georgia,  in the  development  and  implementation  of \nprograms benefiting Democratic candidates for Senate and other federal, state, \nand local offices, such as get-out-the-vote and generic party efforts undertaken \n- 13 -\n\nCase 1:19-cv-05028-WMR   Document 30   Filed 12/27/19   Page 14 of 51\non  behalf  of  the  Democratic  ticket.  In  2018,  DSCC  made  contributions  and \nexpenditures in the tens of millions of dollars to persuade and mobilize voters to \nsupport Democratic Senate candidates. In 2020, Georgia voters will be electing \ntwo U.S. Senators and DSCC intends to make substantial contributions and \nexpenditures to support Democratic candidates for U.S. Senate in Georgia in \n2020. DSCC also intends to provide assistance to the state party. \n25. DSCC is directly harmed by Georgiaโs standardless signature matching \nand notification processesand Gwinnett Countyโs deficient absentee ballotenvelope \nbecause each frustrates its mission and efforts to elect Democratic Party candidates \nin Georgia to the Senate. In recent elections, for example, absentee voters have \ndisproportionately  voted  for  Democratic  candidates.

In an election year in which Georgia is projected to have two\nclosely-watched Senate races, it is crucial that every single eligible voterโs vote is \ncounted. But because Georgiaโs absentee ballot regime consistently disenfranchises \n- 14 -\n\nCase 1:19-cv-05028-WMR   Document 30   Filed 12/27/19   Page 15 of 51\nGeorgia votersโand particularly Democratic votersโDSCC will have to divert \nresources to provide support for voters, resources it otherwise would use to educate \nvoters about issues and individual candidates.\n26. DCCC is the national congressional committee of the Democratic \nParty  as defined  by  52  U.S.C.  ยง  30101(14). DCCCโs  mission  is  electing \nDemocratic candidates to the U.S. House of Representatives from across the \nUnited States, including from Georgiaโs 14 congressional districts. DCCC works \nto accomplish its mission by, among other things, making expenditures for, and \ncontributions to, Democratic candidates for U.S. Congress and assisting state \nparties throughout the country, including in Georgia. For 2020, DCCC will \nexpend significant resources to support Democratic candidates in a number of \ntargeted  races  in  Georgiaโs  14  congressional districts, including  the  7th\nCongressional District, which includes parts of Gwinnett County. Overall, in \n2020, DCCC expects to make contributions and expenditures in the millions of \ndollars to persuade and mobilize voters to support Democratic candidates in \ncongressional elections around the country. DCCC also provides assistance to \nthe state Democratic parties in the development and implementation of programs \nbenefiting Democratic candidates for federal, state, and local office, including \nget-out-the-vote initiatives and other initiatives designed to increase turnout by \n- 15 -\n\nCase 1:19-cv-05028-WMR   Document 30   Filed 12/27/19   Page 16 of 51\nDemocratic voters.  \n27. DCCC is directly harmed by Georgiaโs standardless signature matching \nand notification processesand Gwinnett Countyโs deficientabsentee ballotenvelope \nbecause each frustrates its mission and efforts to elect candidates to the U.S. House \nof Representativesin Georgia.

But \nbecause  Georgiaโs  absentee  ballot  regime  consistently  disenfranchises  Georgia \nvotersโand particularly Democratic votersโDCCC will have to divert resources to \nprovide support for voters, resources it otherwise would use to educate voters about \nissues and individual candidates.\n28.

As a \nresult,  County  Election  Officials  have  no  basis  by  which  to  evaluate  stylistic \ndifferences  that  might  suggest  that  two  signatures  were  made  by  different \nindividuals, as opposed to one individual whose signatures merely show natural \nvariations for reasons unrelated to their authenticity.\n45. Because  Georgiaโs  signature  matching  process  involves  untrained \nhuman reviewers, it is highly error-prone. Studies conducted by experts in the field \nof  handwriting  analysis  have  repeatedly  found  that  signature  verification  by \nlaypersons is inherently unreliable, and non-experts are significantly more likely to \nmisidentify authentic signatures as forgeries.\n46. In  one  study,  for  instance,  laypersons  falsely  declared  authentic \nsignatures to be inauthentic at least 26 percent of the time, despite having access to \nsix  authentic  reference  signatures  for  comparison.  K.  Gummadidala,  Signature \nauthentication by forensic document examiners, J. FORENSIC SCI., 46(4) 884-88 \n(2001).\n47. Rejecting hundreds of absentee ballots based on a perceived signature\n- 24 -\n\nCase 1:19-cv-05028-WMR   Document 30   Filed 12/27/19   Page 25 of 51\nmismatch, given the absence of sufficient training or consistent standards applied \nacross counties, is particularly problematic because handwriting can changeโand \nquicklyโfor a variety of reasons.\n48. Factors that can affect a personโs handwriting include physical factors\nsuch as age, illness, injury, medication, eyesight, alcohol, and drugs; mechanical \nfactors, such as pen type, ink, writing surface and position, and paper quality; and \npsychological state of mind.See, e.g., Tomislav Fotak, et al., Handwritten signature\nidentification using basic concepts of graph theory, 7 WSEAS Transactions on \nSignal Processing 145 (2011).\n49. It  is,  therefore,  inevitable  that  Georgia  election  officials  will \nerroneously  determine  votersโ  signatures  are  mismatched,  leading  to  wrongful \nrejection  of legitimate  ballots and  the disenfranchisement hundreds  of eligible \nvoters.\n50. Moreover, signature matching laws are particularly problematic for \nracial and ethnic minority voters; young, first-time voters; voters with disabilities; \nand senior citizen voters, all of whom are more likely to have variations in their \nsignatures, or voters who may require assistance from others to enter a signature. \nSee Caligiuri, supra (concluding that the โadvanced age of a writer likely contributes \nto uncertainty and reduced reliability in the document examinerโs judgment of \n- 25 -\n\nCase 1:19-cv-05028-WMR   Document 30   Filed 12/27/19   Page 26 of 51\nauthenticityโ). And this is true in Georgia, where the signatures of racial and ethnic \nminority voters are often flagged for signature mismatch.As one federal court found, \nthe absence of any standards or training to differentiate between natural signature \nvariation  and signature  mismatches  results in  โa  crazy  quilt  of conflicting  and \ndiverging procedures.โ Fla. Democratic Party v. Detzner, No. 4:16-cv-607, 2016 \nWL 6090943, at *7 (N.D. Fla. Oct. 16, 2016). This is particularly true in Georgia. \nwhere counties use different signature matching procedures for absentee ballots.\nIndeed, some  counties  provide  election  officials  with  minimal  instructions  on \nreviewing signatures, though they do not provide any specific signature matching \ncriteria. While other counties do not provide election officials with any instructions, \nprocedures, or guidelines for conducting signature match at all. \n51. The absence of adequate training, guidance, and uniform standards has \nresulted in significant variations in absentee ballot application and ballot rejection \nrates for signature mismatch across Georgiaโs 159 counties. For example, during the \n2018 general election, Gwinnett County Election Officials rejected 56 absentee \nballot applications for mismatched signatures, over 6 percent of the total rejected \napplications statewide (905). Meanwhile, Dekalb County Election Officials rejected \n31 applications for signature mismatch (40 percent of the countyโs 77 rejected \napplications) and Forsyth County Election Officials did not reject any absentee \n- 26 -\n\nCase 1:19-cv-05028-WMR   Document 30   Filed 12/27/19   Page 27 of 51\nballot applications for signature mismatch. \n52. The same variation occurred for absentee ballots. During the 2018 \ngeneral election, Henry County Election Officials rejected 25 absentee ballots for \nsignature mismatch, 11 percent of the ballots rejected statewide for that reason. And \nof the 30,214 absentee ballots cast in Gwinnett County, County Election Officials \nrejected 15 for mismatched signatures. In Cobb County, election officials rejected \njust 11 out of the 30,877 absentee ballots received for mismatched signatures (less \nthan 2 percent of the 662 absentee ballots rejected in the county). And in Fulton \nCounty, the most populous county in Georgia, County Election Officials rejected \njust 1 out of the 23,201 absentee ballots cast for a mismatched signature. \n53. Given  the  lack  of  uniformity  among  the  counties,  the  risk  of \ndisenfranchisement will continue to be dependent on where a voter lives and how \nthat county chooses toreview signaturesunder the current law. There is no sufficient \njustification for this standardless signature match requirement. \nThe Notification Process\n54. As describedabove,Georgialaw does not define โpromptโ notification;\nnor does it specify the method of notification a board of registrars or absentee clerk \nmust use. And, neither the Secretary nor the State Election Board has issued rules or \nregulations defining or identifying the proper form of prompt notification.   \n- 27 -\n\nCase 1:19-cv-05028-WMR   Document 30   Filed 12/27/19   Page 28 of 51\n55. As a result, counties inconsistently interpret the promptness of the \nnotice required and employ varying methods of contacting voters. For example, \nduring the 2018 general election Gwinnett County sent notice by mail within three \ndays of marking the absentee ballot โRejected.โ Thus, voters whose absentee ballots \narrived on election day did not receive notice until the cure period had ended. These \nvoters were ultimately disenfranchised. Likewise, voters whose absentee ballots \nwere received and reviewed within two days of the election were given only one or \ntwo days to cure their absentee ballot. \n56. Given  that  absentee  ballots  are  valid  if  received  by  7:00 p.m.  on \nElection Day, id. atยง 21-2-386(a)(1)(F), and that voters have three days after the day \nof  the  election  to  cure  a  missing  or  mismatched  signature,  id. at ยงยง  21-2-\n386(a)(1)(C), -419(c), had voters received sufficient notice, there is no reason that \nthey could not have cured their absentee ballots as the law contemplates. \n57. By  contrast,  during the  2018  general  election, election  officials  in \nForsyth and Bulloch Counties first attempted to call and/or email voters to inform \nthem that their signatures were โinvalidโ or missing from their absentee ballots and \nto encourage them to cure their ballots, meaning that these voters were informed of \nthe defect nearly instantaneously and, solely because of where they lived, were given \na meaningful opportunity to cure.\n- 28 -\n\nCase 1:19-cv-05028-WMR   Document 30   Filed 12/27/19   Page 29 of 51\n58. The  impact of  Georgiaโs  standardless  notification  procedure  is \ndemonstrated by the varying rejection rates across the state. Of the 30,214 absentee\nballots cast in Gwinnett County during the 2018 general election, County Election \nOfficials rejected 118of them for missing or mismatched signatures, which accounts \nfor nearly 7 percent of the total absentee ballots rejected in Georgia (1,690). Of the \n30,877 absentee ballots received in Cobb County, election officials rejected just \ntwenty for missing or mismatched signatures (3 percent of the 662 absentee ballots \nrejected in the county). In Forsyth County, officials rejected 99 out of the 5,228 \nabsentee ballots cast (1.9 percent); 25 of those ballots were rejected for missing or \nmismatched  signatures  (25  percent  of  the  rejected  ballots). Given  the  lack  of \nuniformity among the counties, the risk of disenfranchisement will continue to be \ndependent on where a voter lives and how that county chooses to contact the voter\nunder the current law.\nGwinnett Countyโs Absentee Ballot Envelope Design\n59. While the standardless process for signature matching and notifying \nabsentee voters of missing or mismatched signatures leaves all absentee voters \nacross Georgia at risk of disenfranchisement, the burden is exacerbated in Gwinnett \nCounty due to the deficient design of the Countyโs absentee ballot envelope. This is \nparticularly concerning because more than 44.5 percent of the registered vote of \n- 29 -\n\nCase 1:19-cv-05028-WMR   Document 30   Filed 12/27/19   Page 30 of 51\nGwinnett County are people of color, with black or African-American voters making \nup one-third (27 percent) of Gwinnett Countyโs active voting population, and the \nHispanic/Latino population makingup 8.7 percent of active voters. GwinnettCounty \nalso has the largest number of active American Indian or Alaskan Native voters, \nAsian or Pacific Islander voters, and Hispanic/Latino voters in the State. During the \n2018 general election, ballots cast by African Americans and Hispanics/Latinos \nmade up 49 percent of rejected absentee ballots in the County.\n60. Georgia law provides that each county superintendent must design the \nabsentee ballot envelope to include the oath specified by the Secretary and described \nin O.C.G.A. ยง 21-2-384(c)(1). See id. ยง 21-2-384(a)(1), (b), (c). \n61. The  ballot  envelope  designs,  however, can  vary  based  on  county-\nspecific  needs.  For example,  Gwinnett  County  is  the  only  county  in  the  State \nrequired under federal mandate to provide all voting materials in both English and \nSpanish,  given  its  large  Hispanic/Latino population.  Thus, as  described  above, \nGwinnett Countyโs absentee ballot envelope design differs from other countiesโ \nenvelopes. \n62. As  a  result,  unlike  the  simpler  and  easier  to  read  absentee ballot \nenvelopes in Fulton or Dekalb Counties, Gwinnett Countyโs ballot is nearly illegible. \nThe oath is printed on absentee ballot envelopes in small, approximately 6.5-point\n- 30 -\n\nCase 1:19-cv-05028-WMR   Document 30   Filed 12/27/19   Page 31 of 51\nfont in both English and Spanish.At the top of the envelope, the English and Spanish \noaths are on top of each other; but on the bottom, the English and Spanish oaths for \nassisting electors are on the left and right side, respectively. The envelopeโs poor \ndesign  is  cramped  and  difficult  for  voters  to  read  and  understand. By  way  of \nexample,  below  is  the  back  of  the  absentee  ballot  envelope  used  during  the \nNovember 2018 general election: \n- 31 -\n\nCase 1:19-cv-05028-WMR   Document 30   Filed 12/27/19   Page 32 of 51\n- 32 -\n\nCase 1:19-cv-05028-WMR   Document 30   Filed 12/27/19   Page 33 of 51\n63. At least one study has shown that rejection of absentee ballots for \ntechnical errors such as failing to sign the absentee envelope is caused by poorly \ndesigned and unusable absentee ballot envelopes.Brennan Center, Better Design, \nBetter Elections at 30-33, https://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/2019-\n08/Report_Better_Design_ Better_Elections.pdf (last visited, Nov. 4, 2019). And \nwhen the envelopes are redesigned to be clearer and more readable, the number of \nunsigned ballots significantly decreases. Id.\n64. Though the 2019 amendments to O.C.G.A. ยง 21-2-384(c)(1) ensure that \nthe voterโs address and birth year will be removed from the oath above, because the \noath contains largely the same language as before, it is anticipated that Gwinnett \nCountyโs updated absentee ballot envelope will be substantially similar to the format \nset out above, meaning that it will continue to be dense and unreadable, confusing \nvoters and making it difficult for them to properly complete their absentee ballot\nenvelope. \n65. Given the poor design of Gwinnett Countyโs absentee ballot envelope,\nand the grossly inadequate signature matching and notification procedures described \nsupra, the Countyunsurprisingly rejects absentee ballots at an alarmingly higher rate \nthan other counties for missing or mismatched signatures. During the 2018 general \nelection, even after multiple lawsuits prohibiting election officials from rejecting \n- 33 -\n\nCase 1:19-cv-05028-WMR   Document 30   Filed 12/27/19   Page 34 of 51\nabsentee ballots for missing or inaccurate oath information and permitting absentee \nvotersto curemismatched signatures on their absentee ballots, Gwinnett County still \nultimately rejected 118 absentee ballots for missing or mismatched signatures. \n66. Meanwhile  other  counties  rejected  a  lower  number  of  ballots for \nmissing or mismatched signatures. For example, in Dekalb County during the 2018 \ngeneral election, election officials rejected only 15 absentee ballots for missing or \nmismatchedsignatures. And in Fulton County, the most populous county in Georgia, \nelection officials rejected just 2 ballots for a missing or mismatched signature. \nIndeed, Gwinnett County had a significantly higher rate of rejecting absentee voters \nthan any other county in the state during the 2018 general election. This high \nrejection  rate  is  particularly  significant  because  Gwinnett  County  comprises \napproximately 8 percent of active voters in Georgia, the second largest number of \nactive voters out of every county in the State. And the high absentee ballot rejection \nrate within Gwinnett County disproportionately impacts racial, ethnic, and language \nminorities. \n67. The wide disparity in rejection rates between Gwinnett County and \nother counties in the state demonstrates that the deficient design, dense language, \nand small type of the oath on Gwinnett Countyโs absentee ballot envelopes has \ncaused voters to submit their ballots without properly completing the signature \n- 34 -\n\nCase 1:19-cv-05028-WMR   Document 30   Filed 12/27/19   Page 35 of 51\nrequirement. And, as described above, even with changes to the oath for future \nelections as compared to the oath in 2018, the Gwinnett County absentee ballot\nenvelope will continue to be confusing and illegible for voters. \nCOUNT I\nEqual Protection\nU.S. Const.

Supp. 3d at 217.\n82. Due process requires that all voters in Georgia be afforded a meaningful \nnotice and an opportunity to cure missing or mismatched signatures before a voterโs \nballot is permanently rejected. The current โprompt notificationโ law set out in \nO.C.G.A. ยง 21-2-386(a)(1)(C) fails to provide such process and, as a result, votersโ \nballots are not fairly considered and counted, even where the voter is wholly eligible \nto vote and, with proper notice, could have cured his or her absentee ballot. \n83. As numerous other courts have found, a stateโs failure to ensure that all \nabsentee ballots are not rejected before a voter is notified and provided a meaningful \nopportunity to be heard violates a voterโs procedural due process rights. See, e.g.,\nSaucedo, 335 F. Supp. 3d at 222; Martin v. Kemp, 341 F. Supp. 3d at 1339โ40; \nZessar v. Helander, No. 1:05-cv-1917, 2006 WL 642646, at *6ห10 (N.D. Ill.

See Burdick, 504 U.S. at \n434; Anderson, 460 U.S. at 789. โHowever slight th[e] burden may appear, . . . it \nmust be justified by relevant and legitimate state interests sufficiently weighty to \njustify the limitation.โ Crawford, 553 U.S. at 191 (Stevens, J., controlling opinion) \n(internal quotation marks omitted). \n98. The deficient absentee ballot design created bythe Defendant Gwinnett \nBoard Members will impose a burden on Plaintiffs, their constituents, and other \nGeorgia voters in Gwinnett County. \n99. The Gwinnett County absentee ballot envelope is a densely-worded, \npoorly designed form, with instructions alternating in English and Spanish, printed \nin approximately size 6.5-point font and provides no clear notice that a signature is \nmandatory. As a result, the form is confusing to voters and makes it far more likely \nthat they will be unable to properly complete the signature requirement for absentee \nballots. This burden is particularly severe for African-Americans and Latinos, who \nmake up over 35 percent of Gwinnett Countyโs active voting population, and 49\npercent of rejected absentee ballots during the 2018 general election. \n100. Further,  the  threat  of  disenfranchisement  in  Gwinnett  County  is \n- 44 -\n\nCase 1:19-cv-05028-WMR   Document 30   Filed 12/27/19   Page 45 of 51\nparticularly high given Gwinnettโs ineffective notice procedures for absentee ballots.\n101. Withoutaction from this Court, a significant numberofvoters will have\ntheir right to vote burdened, if not wholly denied, in upcoming elections due to \nGwinnett Countyโs absentee ballot envelope design, which places these voters at a \nheightened risk of returning an absentee ballot without properly completing the \nsignature requirement and increase the risk that their ballots will be rejected.\n102. The use of a densely-worded and confusing absentee ballot envelope, \nexposing votersto the risk of having their ballots rejectedfor missingor mismatched\nsignatures, for the reasons discussed herein, is not supported by any material or \nimportant government interest (indeed, other counties are able to use absentee ballot\nenvelopes that are much easier to understand). Moreover, any benefits are plainly \noutweighed by the severe burden on voters. \n103. Based on  the  foregoing,  the  Defendant  Gwinnett  Board Members,\nacting under color of law, will deprive absentee voters residing in the county, the \nrights  secured  to  them  by  the  First  and  Fourteenth  Amendments  to  the  U.S.\nConstitution and protected by 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983.\n- 45 -\n\nCase 1:19-cv-05028-WMR   Document 30   Filed 12/27/19   Page 46 of 51\nPRAYER FOR RELIEF\nWHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully request that this Court enter judgment: \na) Declaring that the portions of O.C.G.A. ยง 21-2-386(a)(1)(C) that\nrequire  election  officials  to  reject absentee  ballots  based  on \nsignature mismatch violate the Equal Protection Clause of the \nFourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution;\nb) Declaring that the portions of O.C.G.A. ยง 21-2-386(a)(1)(C) that \nrequire  election  officials  to  reject  absentee  ballots  based  on \nsignature mismatch are unduly burdensome in violation of the \nFirst  and  Fourteenth  Amendments  of the  United  States \nConstitution;\nc) Declaring that O.C.G.A. ยง 21-2-386(a)(1)(C) violates the Due \nProcess  Clause  of  the  Fourteenth  Amendment  of  the  United \nStates Constitution because the โshall promptly notifyโ standard \nfails to provide all Georgia voters with notice and a meaningful \nopportunity to contest the status of their absentee ballot and cure \ntheir ballots before rejecting them; \n- 46 -\n\nCase 1:19-cv-05028-WMR   Document 30   Filed 12/27/19   Page 47 of 51\nd) Declaring that O.C.G.A. ยง 21-2-386(a)(1)(C) violates the Equal \nProtection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United \nStates Constitution because it fails to provide a uniform standard \nby  which  election  officials  โshall  promptly  notifyโ  Georgia \ncitizens of their rejected ballots;\ne) Declaring that the lack of uniform standards for providing notice \nto Georgia voters regarding their rejected absentee ballots is \nunduly  burdensome  in  violation  of  the  First  and  Fourteenth \nAmendments of the United States Constitution;\nf) Declaring that the Gwinnett Countyโs absentee ballot envelope\ndesign is  unduly burdensome  in  violation  of  the  First  and \nFourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution;\ng) Requiring the Secretary and the State Election Board to instruct \nCounty  Election  Officials  to  notify  voters  of  missing  or \nmismatched signatures by telephone, email, and/or text message \nwithin one day of receiving the absentee ballot;\nh) Preliminarily and permanently enjoining the Secretary and the \nState Election Board from enforcing the portions of O.C.G.A. ยง \n21-2-386(a)(1)(C) that  require  election  officials  to reject\n- 47 -\n\nCase 1:19-cv-05028-WMR   Document 30   Filed 12/27/19   Page 48 of 51\nabsentee ballots based on a signature mismatch;\ni) Preliminarily  and  permanently  enjoining  the  Gwinnett  Board\nfrom  creating,  preparing,  and  distributing  absentee  ballot\nenvelopes with a confusing, illegible design;\nj) Awarding  Plaintiffs costs,  disbursements,  and  reasonable \nattorneysโ fees incurred in bringing this action pursuant to 42 \nU.S.C. ยง 1988 and other applicable laws; and granting such other \nand further relief as the Court deems just and proper.\n- 48 -\n\nCase 1:19-cv-05028-WMR   Document 30   Filed 12/27/19   Page 49 of 51\nDated: December 27, 2019 Respectfullysubmitted,\nMarc Erik Elias\nMarc Erik Elias*\nBruce V.

Based upon information and belief, Plaintiffs allege \nas follows: \nNATURE OF THE CASE  \n1.   โNo right is more precious in a free country than that of having a voice \nin the election of those who make the laws under which, as good citizens, we must \nlive. Other rights, even the most basic, are illusory if the right to vote is undermined.โ \nWesberry v. Sanders, 376 U.S. 1, 17 (1964). Plaintiffs bring this lawsuit to protect \nthis right and to prevent the disenfranchisement of Georgia voters whose absentee \nby-mail  (โabsenteeโ)  ballots  have  been  rejected  for  missing  or  mismatched \n  - 2 - \n\nCase 1:19-cv-05028-WMR   Document 1   Filed 11/06/19   Page 3 of 40\n \n \nsignatures. The cause of this disenfranchisement is Georgiaโs standardless procedure \nfor notifying absentee voters that their signatures are either missing or inconsistent, \nwhich fails to provide Georgia voters with a meaningful ability to cure their ballots \nwithin  the  prescribed  timeframe.  This  disenfranchisement  disproportionately \nimpacts  African-American  and  other  minority  voters  and  has  a  particularly \ndetrimental impact on minority voters in Gwinnett County, who are further burdened \nby Gwinnett Countyโs poorly designed, confusing absentee ballot envelope, which \nplaces these voters at a heightened risk of returning an absentee ballot  without \nproperly completing the signature requirement. Because of Georgiaโs standardless \nprocedure,  and  Gwinnett  Countyโs  confusing  absentee  ballot  envelope  design, \nhundreds of Georgia voters have had their ballots rejected and their votes have not \nbeen counted, and hundreds more face the same fate in the 2020 election without \nintervention from this Court. \n2.  Absentee voting is extraordinarily popular among Georgia voters and \nhas grown in popularity over time. Applications for absentee ballots surged in \nadvance of the 2018 general elections, with over 281,000 Georgia voters requesting \nabsentee ballots. And, despite the fact that turnout has historically been lower in \nmidterm  elections  than  in  presidential  elections,  the  total  number  of  returned \nabsentee ballots in the 2018 midterm electionโธบnearly 284,393โธบwas greater than \n  - 3 - \n\nCase 1:19-cv-05028-WMR   Document 1   Filed 11/06/19   Page 4 of 40\n \n \nthe number cast in the 2016 presidential election, 246,621. \n3.  Georgia also routinely rejects a significant number of absentee ballots. \nOf the combined 531,014 absentee ballots cast in the past two general elections, \n6,681 have been  rejected  for  technical  reasons  wholly  unrelated  to  the voterโs \nqualifications, including failing to sign the oath on the back of the absentee ballot \nenvelope or having a  mismatched signature. During the 2016  general election, \nGeorgia County Election Officials rejected 580 absentee ballots for missing or \ninaccurate oath information, including missing and mismatched signatures. And, in \nthe 2018 general election, County Election Officials rejected 454 ballots for the same \nreason. One countyโGwinnettโrejected far more absentee ballots, 117, for missing \nor mismatched signatures than any other county. \n4.  The number of absentee ballots rejected for a missing or mismatched \nsignature is significant, especially when evaluated in context. Saucedo v. Gardner, \n335 F. Supp. 3d 202, 217 (D.N.H. 2018) (โ[t]he overall rates of rejection due to a \nsignature mismatch have been low in recent general elections. But those rates should \nbe put into perspective.โ). Recently, elections in Georgia have been decided by small \nmargins. For example, the Democratic candidate in the 2018 gubernatorial race, who \nreceived a substantial majority of the votes cast by absentee ballots (137,616 out of \nthe 223,576  absentee  ballots  cast),  lost by  under 55,000 votes  (1.3  percentage \n  - 4 - \n\nCase 1:19-cv-05028-WMR   Document 1   Filed 11/06/19   Page 5 of 40\n \n \npoints). And in an even closer race, the Democratic candidate for Georgiaโs 7th \nCongressional  District  for  the  U.S.  House  of  Representatives,  who  received \n57 percent of the absentee ballot votes (10,466 out of 18,217 absentee ballots cast), \nlost  by  just  419  votes  (.14  percentage  points).  Georgiaโs  arbitrary  rejection  of \nabsentee ballots not only disenfranchises individual voters, but it also leads to \nelection results that may not reflect the will and intent of Georgiaโs electorate.   \n5.  Because  such  a  significant  number  of  absentee  ballots  have  been \nrejected in Georgia, the State has seen a flood of litigation since the 2018 general \nelection aimed at ending the disenfranchisement caused by  the absentee voting \nregime. In a series of opinions, courts in this district have repeatedly found that \noutright rejection of absentee ballots for missing or inaccurate oath information \nviolates the U.S. Constitution and the Civil Rights Act, 52 U.S.C. ยง 10101(a)(2)(B). \nSee Democratic Party of Ga., Inc. v. Crittenden, 347 F. Supp. 3d 1324 (N.D. Ga. \n2018); Martin v. Crittenden, 347 F. Supp. 3d 1302 (N.D. Ga. 2018); Martin v. Kemp, \n341 F. Supp. 3d 1326 (N.D. Ga. 2018). \n6.  As  a  result,  the  Georgia  General  Assembly  amended  the  absentee \nvoting scheme in an attempt to prevent absentee ballots from being rejected for \ntechnical reasons, including for missing or mismatched signatures. Specifically, the \nGeneral Assembly modified the language of the oath on the absentee ballot envelope \n  - 5 - \n\nCase 1:19-cv-05028-WMR   Document 1   Filed 11/06/19   Page 6 of 40\n \n \nto remove requests for certain technical information. And, adding to the existing \nrequirement  that  election  officials  โpromptly  notifyโ  the  voter  of  a  missing  or \nmismatched signature, it required that election officials give a voter until three days \nafter the date of the election to cure a signature before rejecting an absentee ballot \nfor a missing or mismatched signature. O.C.G.A. ยงยง 21-2-386(a)(1)(C), -419(c).  \n7.   These  reforms,  however,  do  not  remedy  the  flaws  in  Georgiaโs \nabsentee ballot regime and will not end the unconstitutional disenfranchisement of \nvoters. Most glaringly, the law still does not provide any timeliness standard for \nelection officials to โpromptlyโ notify voters of missing or mismatched signatures; \nnor does it provide any standard for the form of notice required. As a result, counties \ninterpret โpromptโ notice differently and use inconsistent methods to inform voters \nof the need to cure their absentee ballots. For example, some counties send letters \nby first-class mail, while others call or email voters. And some counties provide \nnotification  up  to  three  days  after  identifying  the  missing  signature.  Such  an \ninterpretation is problematic for voters whose absentee ballots are submitted on or \nclose to election day, as they are sent letters three days later and are not notified with \nsufficient time to cure during the three-day post-election period. Thus, depending on \nwhere the voter lives, she may not receive notice in time to cure and her ballot will \nbe rejected outright, directly contrary to the U.S. Constitution and the rulings of \n  - 6 - \n\nCase 1:19-cv-05028-WMR   Document 1   Filed 11/06/19   Page 7 of 40\n \n \ncourts in this district.  \n8.  Without a uniform standard for the timing for election officials to \nprovide notice to voters about missing or mismatched signatures or the method of \nnotification, practices will continue to vary widely across the state, with each of \nGeorgiaโs 159 counties establishing its own deadline and method. This hodgepodge \napproach unduly burdens absentee votersโ right to vote.  \n9.  These burdens are exacerbated in Gwinnett County, whose high volume \nof absentee ballots with missing or mismatched signatures and corresponding high \nrejection rate is tied not only to Georgiaโs standardless notification regime, but \ndirectly to the confusing and opaque design of its absentee ballot envelope, which \noften prevents voters from even realizing that their signatures are required. Because \nGwinnett County must include the oath in both English and Spanish on the envelope, \nit uses small, nearly illegible type in approximately 6.5-point font.1 By way of \nexample,  .  \nthis text is in size 6.5-point font\n10.  Given the deficient design of the Gwinnett County absentee ballot \n                                                 \n1 Bureau of the Census, Department of Commerce, Voting Rights Act Amendments \nof 2006, Determinations Under Section 203, 81 Fed. Reg. 233, 87535 (Dec. 5, 2016), \nhttps://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2016-12-05/pdf/2016-28969.pdf \n(requiring Gwinnett County to provide voting material in both English and Spanish \ngiven its large Hispanic population). \n  - 7 - \n\nCase 1:19-cv-05028-WMR   Document 1   Filed 11/06/19   Page 8 of 40\n \n \nenvelope, the county rejected more absentee ballots for missing or mismatched \nsignatures than any other county during the 2018 general election (117 of the 454 \nrejected ballots). The recent  changes to the language in the oath on the ballot \nenvelope  do  not  address  the  design  flaws;  Gwinnett  Countyโs  absentee  ballot \nenvelope  remains  lengthy  and  cramped,  and  voters  will  continue  to  find  it \nindiscernible. As such, Gwinnett Countyโs absentee ballot envelope design, coupled \nwith the countyโs inadequate notification procedures under Georgiaโs standardless \nnotification system, will continue to create an unusually high risk that voters who \nvote absentee will have their votes ultimately rejected for missing or mismatched \nsignatures and be disenfranchised. \n11.  Additionally, the continued rejection of absentee ballots for missing \nsignatures will have a disproportionate effect on minority voters, who were twice as \nlikely to have their absentee ballots rejected in 2018. This disparity is particularly \nacute in Gwinnett County, where people of color make up nearly 45 percent of \nregistered voters. African-American and Latino voters make up over 35 percent of \nGwinnett Countyโs active voting population, and they accounted for 49 percent of \nrejected absentee ballots during the 2018 general election.  \n12.  Absent judicial intervention, voters who submit absentee ballots in \nGwinnett County and other areas of the state will continue to have their votes thrown \n  - 8 - \n\nCase 1:19-cv-05028-WMR   Document 1   Filed 11/06/19   Page 9 of 40\n \n \nout in future elections due to the standardless procedure for notifying voters of \nmissing or mismatched signatures in clear violation of the Due Process and Equal \nProtection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Absentee \nvoters in Gwinnett County will have their right to vote further burdened by the \nCountyโs poorly designed ballot envelope in violation of the First and Fourteenth \nAmendments.  \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n13.  Plaintiffs bring this action under 42 U.S.C. ยงยง 1983 and 1988 to redress \nthe deprivation under color of state law of rights secured by the United States \nConstitution.  \n14.  This Court has original jurisdiction over the subject matter of this \naction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยงยง 1331 and 1343 because the matters in controversy \narise under the Constitution and laws of the United States. \n15.  This Court has personal jurisdiction over Defendants, who are sued in \ntheir official capacity  only. \n16.  Venue is proper in this Court under 28 U.S.C. ยง 1391(b) because a \nsubstantial part of the events that gave rise to Plaintiffsโ claims occurred in this \njudicial district. \n17.  This Court has the authority to enter a declaratory judgment and to \n  - 9 - \n\nCase 1:19-cv-05028-WMR   Document 1   Filed 11/06/19   Page 10 of 40\n \n \nprovide preliminary and permanent injunctive relief pursuant to Rules 57 and 65 of \nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and 28 U.S.C. ยงยง 2201 and 2202.  \nPARTIES \n18.  Plaintiff DEMOCRATIC PARTY OF GEORGIA, INC., (โDPGโ) is a \nstate  committee,  as  defined  by  52  U.S.C.  ยง  30101(15),  dedicated  to  electing \ncandidates of the Democratic Party to public office throughout the State of Georgia. \nDPG has members and constituents from across Georgia, including many eligible \nvoters who regularly support and vote for candidates affiliated with the Democratic \nParty. As discussed infra, members and constituents of the Democratic Party risk \nhaving their right to vote burdened and/or denied due to the absentee voting scheme. \nDPG brings these claims on their behalf, as well as in its own right. \n19.   DPG  is  directly  harmed  by  the  Georgiaโs  standardless  absentee \nnotification  process  and  Gwinnett  Countyโs  deficient  absentee  ballot  envelope \nbecause each frustrates its mission and efforts to elect Democratic Party candidates \nin  Georgia,  undermining  DPGโs  efforts  to  successfully  help  elect  Democratic \ncandidates  to  office.  In  recent  elections,  for  example,  absentee  voters  have \ndisproportionately  voted  for  Democratic  candidates.  For  example,  in  the  2018 \ngeneral election, the majority of absentee voters supported the Democratic candidate \nfor governor (137,616 out of the 223,576 absentee ballots castโor 61.5 percent). \n  - 10 - \n\nCase 1:19-cv-05028-WMR   Document 1   Filed 11/06/19   Page 11 of 40\n \n \nThus, Georgiaโs standardless notification process and Gwinnett Countyโs absentee \nballot envelope design disproportionately impacts and undermines DPGโs efforts to \nsuccessfully help elect candidates of the Democratic Party to office. \n20.  Further, as part of DPGโs get-out-the-vote efforts, it engages in a robust \nabsentee voter contact program designed to: (i) inform thousands of voters statewide \nof their ability to cast absentee ballots; (ii) explain the rules and deadlines governing \nvote by mail; and (iii) encourage voters to utilize vote by mail. Georgiaโs laws \nregarding missing and mismatched signatures decrease overall confidence in the \nabsentee voting processes, and Georgiaโs voting scheme generally, thereby directly \nundermining the efforts of DPG to encourage voters to utilize absentee ballots and \nto assist them in exercising their right to vote. Because of Georgiaโs flawed absentee \nvoting  notification  procedure  and  Gwinnett  Countyโs  deficient  absentee  ballot \nenvelope design, DPG will have to divert resources to provide support for voters to \nhelp them avoid disenfranchisement and overcome the burdens they face as a result \nof  these  flawed  laws,  procedures,  and  absentee  voting  materialsโธบresources  it \notherwise would use to educate voters about issues and individual candidates. \n21.  Plaintiff DSCC is a Democratic political committee established and \nmaintained by a national political party, as defined by and used in 11 C.F.R. ยง \n110.2(c)(2)(iii) and provided for in 52 U.S.C. ยง 30116(h).  DSCCโs mission is to \n  - 11 - \n\nCase 1:19-cv-05028-WMR   Document 1   Filed 11/06/19   Page 12 of 40\n \n \nelect candidates of the Democratic Party to the U.S. Senate, including in Georgia, \nwhere  there  will  be  a  competitive  Senate  election  in  2020.  DSCC  works  to \naccomplish its mission by, among other things, contributing money to Democratic \ncandidates for U.S. Senate, making expenditures on behalf of Democratic candidates \nfor U.S. Senate, and assisting state parties throughout the country, including in \nGeorgia, in the development and implementation of programs benefiting Democratic \ncandidates for Senate and other federal, state, and local offices, such as get-out-the-\nvote and generic party efforts undertaken on behalf of the Democratic ticket. In 2018, \nDSCC made contributions and expenditures in the tens of millions of dollars to \npersuade and mobilize voters to support Democratic Senate candidates. In 2020, \nGeorgia voters will be electing two U.S. Senators and DSCC intends to make \nsubstantial contributions and expenditures to support Democratic candidates for U.S. \nSenate in Georgia in 2020. DSCC also intends to provide assistance to the state party.  \n22.  DSCC is directly harmed by Georgiaโs standardless notification process \nand Gwinnett Countyโs deficient absentee ballot envelope because each frustrates its \nmission and efforts to elect Democratic Party candidates in Georgia to the Senate. \nIn recent elections, for example, absentee voters have disproportionately voted for \nDemocratic candidates. For example, in the 2018 general election, the majority of \nabsentee voters supported the Democratic candidate for governor (137,616 out of \n  - 12 - \n\nCase 1:19-cv-05028-WMR   Document 1   Filed 11/06/19   Page 13 of 40\n \n \nthe 223,576 absentee ballots castโor 61.5 percent). Thus, Georgiaโs standardless \nnotification  process  and  Gwinnett  Countyโs  deficient  absentee  ballot  envelope \ndisproportionately impacts and undermines DSCCโs efforts to successfully help \nDemocratic U.S. Senate candidates to office. In an election year in which Georgia is \nprojected to have a closely-watched Senate race, it is crucial that every single eligible \nvoterโs vote is counted. But because Georgiaโs absentee ballot regime consistently \ndisenfranchises Georgia votersโand particularly Democratic votersโDSCC will \nhave to divert resources to provide support for voters, resources it otherwise would \nuse to educate voters about issues and individual candidates. \n23.  DCCC is the national congressional committee of the Democratic Party \nas defined by 52 U.S.C. ยง 30101(14). DCCCโs mission is electing Democratic \ncandidates to the U.S. House of Representatives from across the United States, \nincluding from Georgiaโs 14 congressional districts. DCCC works to accomplish its \nmission by, among other things, making expenditures for, and contributions to, \nDemocratic candidates for U.S. Congress and assisting state parties throughout the \ncountry, including in Georgia. For 2020, DCCC will expend significant resources to \nsupport  Democratic  candidates  in  a  number  of  targeted  races  in  Georgiaโs  14 \ncongressional districts, including the 7th Congressional District, which includes \nparts of Gwinnett County. Overall, in 2020, DCCC expects to make contributions \n  - 13 - \n\nCase 1:19-cv-05028-WMR   Document 1   Filed 11/06/19   Page 14 of 40\n \n \nand expenditures in the millions of dollars to persuade and mobilize voters to support \nDemocratic candidates in congressional elections around the country. DCCC also \nprovides  assistance  to  the  state  Democratic  parties  in  the  development  and \nimplementation of programs benefiting Democratic candidates for federal, state, and \nlocal office, including get-out-the-vote initiatives and other initiatives designed to \nincrease turnout by Democratic voters.   \n24.  DCCC  is  directly  harmed  by  Georgiaโs  standardless  notification \nprocess and Gwinnett Countyโs deficient absentee ballot envelope because each \nfrustrates  its  mission  and  efforts  to  elect  candidates  to  the  U.S.  House  of \nRepresentatives in Georgia. In recent elections, for example, absentee voters have \ndisproportionately  voted  for  Democratic  candidates.  For  example,  in  the  2018 \ngeneral election, the majority of absentee voters supported the Democratic candidate \nfor governor (137,616 out of the 223,576 absentee ballots castโor 61.5 percent). \nThus, Georgiaโs standardless notification process and Gwinnett Countyโs absentee \nballot  envelope  disproportionately  impacts  and  undermines  DCCCโs  efforts  to \nsuccessfully help elect Democratic congressional candidates to office. Just as in \n2018, where the DCCC supported candidates who lost by mere hundreds of votes, \nthe  2020  Georgia  congressional  elections  are  expected  to  be  close  and  it  is \nincreasingly important to ensure that every vote counts.  But because Georgiaโs \n  - 14 - \n\nCase 1:19-cv-05028-WMR   Document 1   Filed 11/06/19   Page 15 of 40\n \n \nabsentee  ballot  regime  consistently  disenfranchises  Georgia  votersโand \nparticularly Democratic votersโDCCC will have to divert resources to provide \nsupport for voters, resources it otherwise would use to educate voters about issues \nand individual candidates. \n25.

To obtain an absentee ballot, the voter must \n  - 17 - \n\nCase 1:19-cv-05028-WMR   Document 1   Filed 11/06/19   Page 18 of 40\n \n \nsubmit  a  written  application  containing  the  voterโs  name,  registration  address, \nmailing address (if different), the election the voter wishes to participate in, and the \nname and relationship of the person requesting the ballot if other than the elector.

O.C.G.A.  ยง  21-2-384(b).  The  voter  must  place  the \ncompleted absentee ballot in the smaller of the two envelopes. Id. The smaller \nenvelope must then be placed in the larger envelope, which contains the oath of the \nvoterโธบreferred to as an โelectorโ in the oathโธบand a line for the voterโs signature on \nthe back of the envelope. Id. at ยง 21-2-384(b)-(c).   \n32.  The form of the oath is specified by O.C.G.A. ยง 21-2-384(c)(1), which \nstates that: The oaths referred to in subsection (b) of this Code section shall be in \nsubstantially the following form: \nI, the undersigned, do swear (or affirm) that I am a citizen of the United \nStates and of the State of Georgia; that I possess the qualifications of \n  - 18 - \n\nCase 1:19-cv-05028-WMR   Document 1   Filed 11/06/19   Page 19 of 40\n \n \nan elector required by the laws of the State of Georgia; that I am entitled \nto  vote  in  the  precinct  containing  my  residence  in  the  primary  or \nelection in which this ballot is to be cast; that I am eligible to vote by \nabsentee ballot; that I have not marked or mailed any other absentee \nballot, nor will I mark or mail another absentee ballot for voting in such \nprimary or election; nor shall I vote therein in person; and that I have \nread and understand the instructions accompanying this ballot; and that \nI have carefully complied with such instructions in completing this \nballot. I understand that the offer or acceptance of money or any other \nobject of value to vote for any particular candidate, list of candidates, \nissue, or list of issues included in this election constitutes an act of voter \nfraud and is a felony under Georgia law. \n  \n________________________ \nSignature or Mark of Elector \n________________________ \nPrinted Name of Elector \n \n33.  The  ballot  envelope  must  also  include  an  oath  for  those  who  are \nassisting absentee voters, in substantially the following form:2   \nOath of Person Assisting Elector (if any): \nI, the undersigned, do swear (or affirm) that I assisted the above-named \nelector  in  marking  such  elector's  absentee  ballot  as  such  elector \npersonally communicated such elector's preference to me; and that such \nelector is entitled to receive assistance in voting under provisions of \nsubsection (a) of Code Section 21-2-409. \n \nThis, the ______ day of _________, _________. \n                                                 \n2 Before the General Assembly amended the law in April 2019, the oath required the \nvoter include the county in which they reside, residential address, and birth year. \nO.C.G.A. ยง 21-2-384(c)(1) (July 2017). \n  - 19 - \n\nCase 1:19-cv-05028-WMR   Document 1   Filed 11/06/19   Page 20 of 40\n \n \n__________________________________ \nSignature of Person Assisting Elector \n \nReason for assistance (Check appropriate square): \n Elector is unable to read the English language. \n Elector requires assistance due to physical disability. . . . \nGeorgia  law  provides  that  any  person  who  knowingly  falsifies \ninformation so as to vote illegally by absentee ballot or who illegally \ngives or receives assistance in voting, as specified in Code Section 21-\n2-568 or 21-2-573, shall be guilty of a felony. \n \nO.C.G.A. ยง 21-2-384(c)(1). \n34.  Upon completing the absentee ballot, the voter must secure the ballot \nin the small envelope, enclose it in the larger envelope, sign the oath on the back of \nthe envelope, and return it to the board of registrars or absentee clerk by mail or in \nperson. Id. at ยง 21-2-386(a)(1). \n35.  All absentee ballots must be received by 7:00 p.m. on Election Day to \nbe counted. Id. at ยง 21-2-386(a)(1)(F). \n36.  Pursuant to O.C.G.A. ยง 21-2-386(a)(1)(B), โ[u]pon receipt of each \nballot,โ the registrar or clerk must inspect the information on the oath, including the \nvoterโs  signature,  and  compare  the  signature  to  the  signature  on  the  voterโs \nregistration card or absentee ballot application to determine whether they match.   \n37.  If a signature is missing from the oath on the absentee ballot envelope \n  - 20 - \n\nCase 1:19-cv-05028-WMR   Document 1   Filed 11/06/19   Page 21 of 40\n \n \nor โdoes not appear to be valid,โ (i.e. mismatched), the clerk must โwrite across the \nface of the envelope โRejected,โ giving the reason therefor. . . .

Absentee ballots that have been marked โRejectedโ for missing or \nmismatched signatures will only be counted only if: (1) the voter submits โan \naffidavit to the board of registrars or absentee ballot clerkโ along with a copy of an \naccepted form of identification no later than three days following the election, id. at \nยงยง 21-2-386(a)(1)(C),-417(c), -419(c); (2) the affidavit is in the proper form such \nthat it โaffirm[s] that the ballot was submitted by the elector, is the electorโs ballot, \nand that the elector is registered and qualified to vote in the primary, election, or \nrunoff in question, id. at ยง 21-2-386(a)(1)(C); and (3) โthe board of registrars or \nabsentee ballot clerk finds the affidavit and identification to be sufficient,โ id.3 \n39.

Comp.

O.C.G.A. ยงยง 21-\n2-386(a)(1)(C), -419(c). \n40.  As described above, the law does not define โpromptโ notification; nor \ndoes it specify the method of notification a board of registrars or absentee clerk must \nuse. And, neither the Secretary nor the State Election Board has issued rules or \nregulations defining or identifying the proper form of prompt notification.    \n41.  As a result, counties inconsistently interpret the promptness of the \nnotice required and employ varying methods of contacting voters. For example, \nduring the 2018 general election Gwinnett County sent notice by mail within three \ndays of marking the absentee ballot โRejected.โ Thus, voters whose absentee ballots \narrived on election day did not receive notice until the cure period had ended. These \nvoters were ultimately disenfranchised. Likewise, voters whose absentee ballots \nwere received and reviewed within two days of the election were given only one or \ntwo days to cure their absentee ballot.  \n42.  Given  that  absentee  ballots  are  valid  if  received  by  7:00  p.m.  on \nElection Day, id. at ยง 21-2-386(a)(1)(F), and that voters have three days after the day \nof  the  election  to  cure  a  missing  or  mismatched  signature,  id.  at  ยงยง  21-2-\n386(a)(1)(C), -419(c), had voters received sufficient notice, there is no reason that \nthey could not have cured their absentee ballots as the law contemplates.  \n  - 22 - \n\nCase 1:19-cv-05028-WMR   Document 1   Filed 11/06/19   Page 23 of 40\n \n \n43.  By  contrast,  during the  2018  general  election,  election  officials  in \nForsyth and Bulloch Counties first attempted to call and/or email voters to inform \nthem that their signatures were โinvalidโ or missing from their absentee ballots and \nto encourage them to cure their ballots, meaning that these voters were informed of \nthe defect nearly instantaneously and, solely because of where they lived, were given \na meaningful opportunity to cure. \n44.  The  impact  of  Georgiaโs  standardless  notification  procedure  is \ndemonstrated by the varying rejection rates across the state. Of the 30,214 absentee \nballots cast in Gwinnett County during the 2018 general election, County Election \nOfficials rejected 117 of them for missing signatures, which accounts for nearly 7 \npercent of the total absentee ballots rejected in Georgia (1,690). Of the 30,877 \nabsentee ballots received in Cobb County, election officials rejected just twenty for \nmissing or mismatched signatures (3 percent of the 662 absentee ballots rejected in \nthe county). In Forsyth County, officials rejected 99 out of the 5,228 absentee ballots \ncast (1.9 percent); 25 of those ballots were rejected for missing or mismatched \nsignatures (25 percent of the rejected ballots). Given the lack of uniformity among \nthe counties, the risk of disenfranchisement will continue to be dependent on where \na voter lives and how that county chooses to contact the voter under the current law. \n45.  While the standardless process for notifying absentee voters of missing \n  - 23 - \n\nCase 1:19-cv-05028-WMR   Document 1   Filed 11/06/19   Page 24 of 40\n \n \nor  mismatched  signatures  leaves  all  absentee  voters  across  Georgia  at  risk  of \ndisenfranchisement,  the  burden  is  exacerbated  in  Gwinnett  County  due  to  the \ndeficient  design  of  the  Countyโs  absentee  ballot  envelope.  This  is  particularly \nconcerning because more than  44.5 percent of the  registered vote of Gwinnett \nCounty are people of color, with black or African-American voters making up one-\nthird  (27  percent)  of  Gwinnett  Countyโs  active  voting  population,  and  the \nHispanic/Latino population making up 8.7 percent of active voters. Gwinnett County \nalso has the largest number of active American Indian or Alaskan Native voters, \nAsian or Pacific Islander voters, and Hispanic/Latino voters in the State. During the \n2018 general election, ballots cast by African Americans and Hispanics/Latinos \nmade up 49 percent of rejected absentee ballots in the County. \n46.  Georgia law provides that each county superintendent must design the \nabsentee ballot envelope to include the oath specified by the Secretary and described \nin O.C.G.A. ยง 21-2-384(c)(1). See id. ยง 21-2-384(a)(1), (b), (c).  \n47.  The  ballot  envelope  designs,  however,  can  vary  based  on  county-\nspecific  needs.  For example,  Gwinnett  County  is  the  only  county  in  the  State \nrequired under federal mandate to provide all voting materials in both English and \nSpanish,  given  its  large  Hispanic/Latino  population.  Thus,  as  described  above, \nGwinnett Countyโs absentee ballot envelope design differs from other countiesโ \n  - 24 - \n\nCase 1:19-cv-05028-WMR   Document 1   Filed 11/06/19   Page 25 of 40\n \n \nenvelopes.  \n48.  As  a  result,  unlike  the  simpler  and  easier  to  read  absentee  ballot \nenvelopes in Fulton or Dekalb Counties, Gwinnett Countyโs ballot is nearly illegible. \nThe oath is printed on absentee ballot envelopes in small, approximately 6.5-point \nfont in both English and Spanish. At the top of the envelope, the English and Spanish \noaths are on top of each other; but on the bottom, the English and Spanish oaths for \nassisting electors are on the left and right side, respectively. The envelopeโs poor \ndesign  is  cramped  and  difficult  for  voters  to  read  and  understand. By  way  of \nexample,  below  is  the  back  of  the  absentee  ballot  envelope  used  during  the \nNovember 2018 general election:  \n  - 25 - \n\nCase 1:19-cv-05028-WMR   Document 1   Filed 11/06/19   Page 26 of 40\n \n \n \n  - 26 - \n\nCase 1:19-cv-05028-WMR   Document 1   Filed 11/06/19   Page 27 of 40\n \n \n49.   At least one study has shown that rejection of absentee ballots for \ntechnical errors such as failing to sign the absentee envelope is caused by poorly \ndesigned and unusable absentee ballot envelopes. Brennan Center, Better Design, \nBetter Elections at 30-33, https://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/2019-\n08/Report_Better_Design_ Better_Elections.pdf (last visited, Nov. 4, 2019). And \nwhen the envelopes are redesigned to be clearer and more readable, the number of \nunsigned ballots significantly decreases. Id.  \n50.  Though the 2019 amendments to O.C.G.A. ยง 21-2-384(c)(1) ensure that \nthe voterโs address and birth year will be removed from the oath above, because the \noath contains largely the same language as before, it is anticipated that Gwinnett \nCountyโs updated absentee ballot envelope will be substantially similar to the format \nset out above, meaning that it will continue to be dense and unreadable, confusing \nvoters and making it difficult for them to properly complete their absentee ballot \nenvelope.  \n51.  Given the poor design of Gwinnett Countyโs absentee ballot envelope, \nand the grossly inadequate notification procedures described  supra, the County \nunsurprisingly  rejects  absentee  ballots  at  an  alarmingly  higher  rate  than  other \ncounties for missing or mismatched signatures. During the 2018 general election, \neven after multiple lawsuits prohibiting election officials from rejecting absentee \n  - 27 - \n\nCase 1:19-cv-05028-WMR   Document 1   Filed 11/06/19   Page 28 of 40\n \n \nballots for missing or inaccurate oath information and permitting absentee voters to \ncure  mismatched  signatures  on  their  absentee  ballots,  Gwinnett  County  still \nultimately rejected 117 absentee ballots for missing or mismatched signatures.  \n52.  Meanwhile  other  counties  rejected  a  lower  number  of  ballots  for \nmissing or mismatched signatures. For example, in Dekalb County during the 2018 \ngeneral election, election officials rejected only 15 absentee ballots for missing or \nmismatched signatures. And in Fulton County, the most populous county in Georgia, \nelection officials rejected just two ballots for a missing or mismatched signature. \nIndeed, Gwinnett County had a significantly higher rate of rejecting absentee voters \nthan any other county in the state during the 2018 general election. This high \nrejection  rate  is  particularly  significant  because  Gwinnett  County  comprises \napproximately 8 percent of active voters in Georgia, the second largest number of \nactive voters out of every county in the State. And the high absentee ballot rejection \nrate within Gwinnett County disproportionately impacts racial, ethnic, and language \nminorities.  \n53.  The wide disparity in rejection rates between Gwinnett County and \nother counties in the state demonstrates that the deficient design, dense language, \nand small type of the oath on Gwinnett Countyโs absentee ballot envelopes has \ncaused voters to submit their ballots without properly completing the signature \n  - 28 - \n\nCase 1:19-cv-05028-WMR   Document 1   Filed 11/06/19   Page 29 of 40\n \n \nrequirement. And, as described above, even with changes to the oath for future \nelections as compared to the oath in 2018, the Gwinnett County absentee ballot \nenvelope will continue to be confusing and illegible for voters.  \nCOUNT I \n \nDue Process \nU.S. Const. Amend. XIV, 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 \nDenial of Procedural Due Process by Defendants Raffensperger and State \nElection Board Members \n \n54.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference and reallege all prior paragraphs of \nthis  Complaint and the paragraphs in the counts below as though set forth fully \nherein. \n55.  The Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution prohibits the \nstates from depriving โany person of โฆlibertyโฆwithout due process of law.โ U.S. \nConst. amend. XIV, ยง 1. This due process principle protects the fundamental right \nto vote. And โ[h]aving induced voters to vote by absentee ballot, the State must \nprovide adequate process to ensure that votersโ ballots are fairly considered and, if \neligible, counted.โ Saucedo, 335 F. Supp. 3d at 217. \n56.  Due process requires that all voters in Georgia be afforded a meaningful \nnotice and an opportunity to cure missing or mismatched signatures before a voterโs \nballot is permanently rejected. The current โprompt notificationโ law set out in \nO.C.G.A. ยง 21-2-386(a)(1)(C) fails to provide such process and, as a result, votersโ \n  - 29 - \n\nCase 1:19-cv-05028-WMR   Document 1   Filed 11/06/19   Page 30 of 40\n \n \nballots are not fairly considered and counted, even where the voter is wholly eligible \nto vote and, with proper notice, could have cured his or her absentee ballot.  \n57.  As numerous other courts have found, a stateโs failure to ensure that all \nabsentee ballots are not rejected before a voter is notified and provided a meaningful \nopportunity to be heard violates a voterโs procedural due process rights. See, e.g., \nSaucedo, 335 F. Supp. 3d at 222; Martin v. Kemp, 341 F. Supp. 3d at 1339โ40; \nZessar v. Helander, No. 1:05-cv-1917, 2006 WL 642646, at *6ห10 (N.D. Ill. Mar. \n13, 2006), vacated as moot sub. nom. Zessar v. Keith, 536 F.3d 788 (7th Cir. 2008); \nRaetzel v. Parks/Bellemont Absentee Election Bd., 762 F. Supp. 1354, 1357ห58 (D. \nAriz. 1990).  \n58.  Because voting is a fundamental right, the risk that even one person will \nbe disenfranchised for failure to include a signature or for a mismatched signature \ngiven the differing interpretations and procedures for prompt notice is too significant \nfor Georgia to justify depriving absentee voters a uniform pre-rejection notice that \nensures a meaningful opportunity to be heard.  \n \n \n \n \n  - 30 - \n\nCase 1:19-cv-05028-WMR   Document 1   Filed 11/06/19   Page 31 of 40\n \n \nCOUNT II \n \nEqual Protection  \nU.S. Const. amend. XIV, 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 \nInfringement of the Fourteenth Amendmentโs  \nGuarantee of Equal Protection by Defendants Raffensperger and State Election \nBoard Members \n \n59.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference and reallege all prior paragraphs of \nthis  Complaint and the paragraphs in the counts below as though set forth fully \nherein. \n60.  The  Equal  Protection  Clause of the  Fourteenth  Amendment  to the \nUnited States Constitution prohibits states from โdeny[ing] to any person within its \njurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.โ U.S. Const. amend. XIV, ยง 1. This \nconstitutional provision requires โthat all persons similarly situated should be treated \nalike.โ City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Ctr., 473 U.S. 432, 439 (1985); see also \nBush v. Gore, 531 U.S. 98, 104โ05 (2000) (โHaving once granted the right to vote \non equal terms, the State may not, by later arbitrary and disparate treatment, value \none personโs vote over that of another[,]โ and holding Equal Protection Clause \napplies to โthe manner of [the] exercise [of voting].โ).  \n61.  The varied county by county interpretations of โpromptly notifyโ under \nO.C.G.A. ยง 21-2-386(a)(1)(C) subject similarly situated absentee voters to differing \nstandards under each countyโs application of the provision, resulting in some voters \n  - 31 - \n\nCase 1:19-cv-05028-WMR   Document 1   Filed 11/06/19   Page 32 of 40\n \n \nbeing wholly disenfranchised and/or having less time to cure their absentee ballots \nthan other voters solely based on where they live. \n62.  Defendants Raffensperger and the State Election Board Members have \nfailed to ensure that Georgia absentee voters are treated equally regardless of the \ncounty in which they reside. Due to this disparate treatment, certain absentee voters \nwho cast ballots in the upcoming 2020 election will face burdens and infringements \non their fundamental right to vote that other, similarly situated voters will not face \ndue solely to the county in which they vote. \n63.  Defendantsโ unequal treatment of these voters is not justified by, and is \nnot necessary to promote, any substantial or compelling state interest that cannot be \naccomplished by other, less restrictive means. \n64.  Based  on  the  foregoing,  Defendants  Raffensperger  and  the  State \nElection Board Members, acting under color of state law, have deprived and will \ncontinue to deprive Plaintiffs, their constituents, and other Georgia voters of equal \nprotection under the law secured to them by the Fourteenth Amendment to the \nUnited States Constitution and protected by 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  - 32 - \n\nCase 1:19-cv-05028-WMR   Document 1   Filed 11/06/19   Page 33 of 40\n \n \nCOUNT III \n \nFirst Amendment and Equal Protection  \nU.S. Const. amends. I, XIV, 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 \nUndue Burden on the Right to Vote by Defendants Raffensperger and State \nElection Board Members \n \n65.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference and reallege all prior paragraphs of \nthis  Complaint and the paragraphs in the counts below as though set forth fully \nherein. \n66.  Under the First Amendment and the Equal Protection Clause of the \nFourteenth Amendment, a court considering a challenge to a state election law must \ncarefully balance the character and magnitude of the injury to First and Fourteenth \nAmendment rights that the plaintiff seeks to vindicate against the justifications put \nforward by the State for the burdens imposed by the rule. See Burdick v. Takushi, \n504 U.S. 428, 434 (1992); Anderson v. Celebrezze, 460 U.S. 780, 789 (1983). \nโHowever slight th[e] burden may appear, . . . it must be justified by relevant and \nlegitimate state interests sufficiently weighty to justify the limitation.โ Crawford v. \nMarion Cty. Election Bd., 553 U.S. 181, 191 (2008) (Stevens, J., controlling opinion) \n(internal quotation marks omitted).  \n67.  The countiesโ standardless interpretations of โpromptly notifyโ under \nO.C.G.A. ยง 21-2-386(a)(1)(C) impose a severe burden on the right to vote for \nabsentee voters across the state, leaving them at risk of being wholly disenfranchised \n  - 33 - \n\nCase 1:19-cv-05028-WMR   Document 1   Filed 11/06/19   Page 34 of 40\n \n \ndue to the disparate process for notice applied by each county.   \n68.   This  burden  is  not  outweighed  by  any  legitimate,  much  less \ncompelling, state interest in the law, and countless eligible, registered Georgia voters \nwill suffer direct and irreparable injury if Defendants fail to ensure that a uniform \nstandard for prompt notice is applied in each county. Without relief from this Court, \nthese voters will be deprived of their right to vote in upcoming elections. \n69.  Based  on  the  foregoing,  Defendants  Raffensperger  and  the  State \nElection Board Members, acting under color of law, will deprive Plaintiffs, their \nmembers, constituencies, and the voters who support them, the rights secured to \nthem by the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution and protected \nby 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983.  \nCOUNT IV \n \nFirst Amendment and Equal Protection  \nU.S. Const. amends.

Plaintiffs incorporate by reference and reallege all prior paragraphs of \nthis  Complaint and the paragraphs in the counts below as though set forth fully \nherein. \n71.  Under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and \nthe First Amendment, a state cannot utilize election practices that unduly burden the \n  - 34 - \n\nCase 1:19-cv-05028-WMR   Document 1   Filed 11/06/19   Page 35 of 40\n \n \nright to vote. A court considering a challenge to a state election law must carefully \nbalance  the  character  and  magnitude  of  the  injury  to  First  and  Fourteenth \nAmendment rights that the plaintiff seeks to vindicate against the justifications put \nforward by the State for the burdens imposed by the rule. See Burdick, 504 U.S. at \n434; Anderson, 460 U.S. at 789. โHowever slight th[e] burden may appear, . . . it \nmust be justified by relevant and legitimate state interests sufficiently weighty to \njustify the limitation.โ Crawford, 553 U.S. at 191 (Stevens, J., controlling opinion) \n(internal quotation marks omitted).  \n72.  The deficient absentee ballot design created by the Defendant Gwinnett \nBoard Members will impose a burden on Plaintiffs, their constituents, and other \nGeorgia voters in Gwinnett County.  \n73.  The Gwinnett County absentee ballot envelope is a densely-worded, \npoorly designed form, with instructions alternating in English and Spanish, printed \nin approximately size 6.5-point font and provides no clear notice that a signature is \nmandatory. As a result, the form is confusing to voters and makes it far more likely \nthat they will be unable to properly complete the signature requirement for absentee \nballots. This burden is particularly severe for African-Americans and Latinos, who \nmake up over 35 percent of Gwinnett Countyโs active voting population, and 49 \npercent of rejected absentee ballots during the 2018 general election.  \n  - 35 - \n\nCase 1:19-cv-05028-WMR   Document 1   Filed 11/06/19   Page 36 of 40\n \n \n74.  Further,  the  threat  of  disenfranchisement  in  Gwinnett  County  is \nparticularly high given Gwinnettโs ineffective notice procedures for absentee ballots. \n75.  Without action from this Court, a significant number of voters will have \ntheir right to vote burdened, if not wholly denied, in upcoming elections due to \nGwinnett Countyโs absentee ballot envelope design, which places these voters at a \nheightened risk of returning an absentee ballot without properly completing the \nsignature requirement and increase the risk that their ballots will be rejected. \n76.  The use of a densely-worded and confusing absentee ballot envelope, \nexposing voters to the risk of having their ballots rejected for missing or mismatched \nsignatures, for the reasons discussed herein, is not supported by any material or \nimportant government interest (indeed, other counties are able to use absentee ballot \nenvelopes that are much easier to understand). Moreover, any benefits are plainly \noutweighed by the severe burden on voters.  \n77.  Based  on  the  foregoing,  the  Defendant  Gwinnett  Board  Members, \nacting under color of law, will deprive absentee voters residing in the county, the \nrights  secured  to  them  by  the  First  and  Fourteenth  Amendments  to  the  U.S. \nConstitution and protected by 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983.  \n  - 36 - \n\nCase 1:19-cv-05028-WMR   Document 1   Filed 11/06/19   Page 37 of 40\n \n \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully request that this Court enter judgment:  \na)  Declaring that O.C.G.A. ยง 21-2-386(a)(1)(C) violates the Due \nProcess  Clause  of  the  Fourteenth  Amendment  of  the  United \nStates Constitution because the โshall promptly notifyโ standard \nfails to provide all Georgia voters with notice and a meaningful \nopportunity to contest the status of their absentee ballot and cure \ntheir ballots before rejecting them;  \nb)  Declaring that O.C.G.A. ยง 21-2-386(a)(1)(C) violates the Equal \nProtection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United \nStates Constitution because it fails to provide a uniform standard \nby  which  election  officials  โshall  promptly  notifyโ  Georgia \ncitizens of their rejected ballots; \nc)  Declaring that the lack of uniform standards for providing notice \nto Georgia voters regarding their rejected  absentee ballots is \nunduly  burdensome  in  violation  of  the  First  and  Fourteenth \nAmendments of the United States Constitution; \n  - 37 - \n\nCase 1:19-cv-05028-WMR   Document 1   Filed 11/06/19   Page 38 of 40\n \n \nd)  Declaring that the Gwinnett Countyโs absentee ballot envelope \ndesign  is  unduly  burdensome  in  violation  of  the  First  and \nFourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution; \ne)  Requiring the Secretary and the State Election Board to instruct \nCounty Election Officials to notify voters of missing signatures \nby  telephone,  email,  and/or  text  message  within  one  day  of \nreceiving the absentee ballot; \nf)  Preliminarily  and  permanently  enjoining  the  Gwinnett  Board \nfrom  creating,  preparing,  and  distributing  absentee  ballot \nenvelopes with a confusing, illegible design; \ng)  Awarding  Plaintiffs  costs,  disbursements,  and  reasonable \nattorneysโ fees incurred in bringing this action pursuant to 42 \nU.S.C. ยง 1988 and other applicable laws; and granting such other \nand further relief as the Court deems just and proper. \n   \n  - 38 - \n\nCase 1:19-cv-05028-WMR   Document 1   Filed 11/06/19   Page 39 of 40\n \n \nDated: November 6, 2019  Respectfully submitted, \n \nHalsey G.
