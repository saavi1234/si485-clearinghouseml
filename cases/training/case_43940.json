    "summary": "<p>This is a case about whether Michigan&rsquo;s Elliot-Larsen Civil Rights Act, which, in 2022, the Michigan Supreme Court interpreted to prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity, unconstitutionally infringed on religious liberty. &nbsp;On December 22, 2022, Sacred Heart of Jesus Parish filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Michigan. Sacred Heart, alongside its school, Sacred Heart Academy, and several individual Sacred Heart members (collectively &ldquo;Sacred Heart&rdquo;), sued the Michigan Attorney General, Department of Civil Rights, and Civil Rights Commission under 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1983 alleging violations of their First and Fourteenth Amendment rights. Sacred Heart claimed that application of the Elliott-Larsen Civil Rights Act to prohibit sexual orientation and gender identity discrimination in employment, education, and public accommodation interfered with its ability to practice its Catholic beliefs. In particular, Sacred Heart alleged that it could not at once comply with the Act&rsquo;s prohibitions on discrimination and limit enrollment, hiring, and/or use of space (including bathrooms) to form an &ldquo;intentional Catholic community&rdquo; in line with Catholic values. &nbsp; Therefore, Sacred Heart claimed that the Act violated its free speech and free religious exercise rights as well as associational and parental rights. Represented by the Alliance Defending Freedom, Sacred Heart sought declaratory relief, injunctive relief, and costs and attorneys&rsquo; fees. Also on December 22, 2022, Sacred Heart filed a motion for a preliminary injunction to enjoin the state from enforcing the expanded Act against them.</p>\r\n<p>The case was first assigned to District Court Judge Robert J. Jonker and then reassigned to District Court Judge Jane M. Beckering and Magistrate Judge Phillip J. Green. &nbsp;As of January 2023, the case is ongoing and the preliminary injunction motion remains pending.&nbsp;</p>",

Lara, Regina Gasco-Bentley, \nAnupama Kosaraju, Richard \nCorriveau, David Worthams, and Luke \nR.

In all its years of ministry, \nSacred Heart has never had a problem operating consistent with both the teachings \nof the Catholic Church and the laws of the State of Michigan. Until now.  \nOn July 28, 2022, the Michigan Supreme Court reinterpreted the prohibition \non discrimination โbecause of . . . sexโ in Michiganโs Elliot-Larsen Civil Rights Act \nand penal code to include sexual orientation and gender identity, without providing \nan exemption for religious institutions. Now, the State has forced Sacred Heart to \nmake an unconstitutional and unconscionable choice: Either cease teaching and \npracticing the Catholic faith or close its doors forever.  \nTo comply with Michiganโs re-understood laws, Sacred Heart Parish and its \nschool, Sacred Heart Academy, would be forced to hire faculty and staff who lead \nlives in direct opposition to the Catholic faith, speak messages that violate Church \ndoctrine, and refrain from articulating Catholic beliefs in teaching its students and \nwhen advertising the school to prospective students or job applicants. All of this \nviolates Sacred Heartโs free speech and free exercise rights. Rather than defy \nCatholic doctrine in these ways, Sacred Heart would shut down. \nBut if Sacred Heart cannot operate consistent with its Catholic faith, the \nparental and free exercise rights of its families are also implicated. Parents have \nexplicitly opted out of public schools in favor of sending their children to Sacred \nHeart for an authentic Catholic education where their children would never be \nexposed to harmful ideas and ideologies that contradict the Catholic faith. When \nMichigan prevents Sacred Heart from operating its school consistent with its \nCatholic beliefs, it also necessarily violates the fundamental parental and free \nexercise rights of Sacred Heart families. \n  2\n\nCase 1:22-cv-01214   ECF No. 1,  PageID.3   Filed 12/22/22   Page 3 of 74\nTogether, Sacred Heart and its families ask this Court to vindicate their \nconstitutional rights and for relief from Michiganโs recently reinterpreted law. \nJurisdiction and Venue \n1.  This civil-rights action raises federal questions under the First and \nFourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983. \n2.

Sacred Heart has been serving families ever since. \n22.  Sacred Heart Academy (โSacred Heartโ) remains today a parish-run \nCatholic school in the Diocese of Grand Rapids, Michigan. It is an apostolate (or \nministry) of the parish.  \n23.  Sacred Heartโs mission is to โrestore all things in Christ.โ \n  5\n\nCase 1:22-cv-01214   ECF No. 1,  PageID.6   Filed 12/22/22   Page 6 of 74\n24.  Sacred Heartโs purpose is to โrecover the โBeauty ever ancient, ever \nnewโ through an integrated curricula that forms the whole person inspiring the \nhearts of Catholic students to know, love and serve God.โ \n25.  Sacred Heart exists to support parents in forming their children in the \nCatholic faith by providing a classical Catholic education. \n26.  In 2013, Sacred Heart re-founded its school to add the classical \napproach to the already existing Catholic education.  \n27.  The school is now the only classical Catholic school of its kind in the \nsurrounding area.  \n28.  Sacred Heart provides a Christ-centered education based in the Word \nof God, which is contained in Sacred Scripture, Sacred Tradition, the Magisterium \nof the Catholic Church (the Churchโs teaching authority exercised by popes and \nbishops), and the Catechism of the Catholic Church. \n29.  Sacred Heart Parishโs pastor is the final decision-maker for the school, \nbut he is subordinate to the Bishop of Grand Rapids, David J. Walkowiak. \n30.  Sacred Heart Academyโs handbook and moral expectations are derived \nfrom and rely on the Catechism of the Catholic Church. Catholic schools exist to \npass on the faith and to form Christian believers. See Congregation for Catholic \nEducation, The Catholic School on the Threshold of the Third Millennium ยถ 11 (Dec. \n28, 1997). \n31.  Sacred Heartโs student discipline policies seek to form students in \nvirtue and are based in the Catechism of the Catholic Church. Exhibit (โEx.โ) 1, \nStudent Handbook, at 16โ20. \n32.  Catholic schools must be authentic Christian communities animated \nby the spirit of Jesus Christ. \n33.  The Catholic Church (โthe Churchโ) teachesโand Sacred Heart \nbelievesโthat parents are the primary and principal educators of their children \n  6\n\nCase 1:22-cv-01214   ECF No. 1,  PageID.7   Filed 12/22/22   Page 7 of 74\nand that the school exists to supplement and support parents in their educational \nrole. Catechism of the Catholic Church (โC.C.C.โ) ยถ 2223. \n34.  Sacred Heart and its faculty view the school as an extension of parentsโ \nhomes. \n35.  In line with this vision, parents are integrally involved in Sacred \nHeart. For example, the drama program, sports program, dances, and school \nlunches are organized and run by parents. \n36.  Sacred Heart strives to draw its students into an authentically \nCatholic culture. \n37.  Because Sacred Heart exists primarily to pass on the Catholic faith in \nthe classical education tradition, it necessarily seeks to build an intentional \nCatholic community and culture. \n38.  Sacred Heartโs culture is informed by the Churchโs liturgical life. The \nschoolโs calendar is planned around the Churchโs liturgical calendar and school-\nwide events and celebrations recognize significant Feasts and liturgical seasons \nthroughout the year. \n39.  For example, on Holy Days of Obligation, daily Mass is more solemn, \nsung, and often includes processions and/or Eucharistic Adoration, and the rest of \nthe school day is marked by an intentional avoidance of servile labor, in favor of \ndevotions, spiritual retreats, community service, pilgrimages, in class celebrations, \nsongs, and other traditional festive practices compatible with the spirit of Sabbath \nrest.  \n40.  Sacred Heartโs goal for its faculty, students, and families is eternal life \nin Heaven. \n41.  Sacred Heart welcomes any family desiring the formation offered in its \nCatholic classical setting. \n  7\n\nCase 1:22-cv-01214   ECF No. 1,  PageID.8   Filed 12/22/22   Page 8 of 74\n42.  At Sacred Heart of Jesus Parish and Sacred Heart Academy, families \nare striving to build an intentional Catholic community. They want the distinctly \nCatholic formation and culture that Sacred Heart provides children. Numerous \nfamilies have purchased homes in the parishโs neighborhood. Others drive their \nchildren an hour each way to and from school to provide this religious formation \nand education for them. And some families have moved to Michigan from other \nstates to send their children to the school and join the community.  \n43.  Sacred Heart serves nearly 400 children from pre-kindergarten \nthrough the twelfth grade. \n44.  Every Sacred Heart student, from second grade and up, is required to \nattend Mass at the beginning of each day. The lower grades, who have not yet \nreceived First Communion, attend Mass several times per week. All Sacred Heart \nfaculty also attend daily Mass. \n45.  Catholic doctrine and the Catholic faith permeate every subject at \nSacred Heart. \n46.  The purpose of the Sacred Heart curriculum is the pursuit of truth, \nand the whole curriculum is founded upon the Catholic understanding of man and \nwoman and the purpose of each. \n47.  Sacred Heart believes that in order to correctly teach truth to its \nstudents, its curriculum must necessarily be founded on a proper understanding of \nhuman anthropology.  \n48.  Sacred Heartโs curriculum includes explicitly religious instruction. For \nexample, younger students are taught from a religious education curriculum called \nthe Catechism of the Good Shepherd and older students take mandatory theology \ncourses. Older students are also offered additional elective theology courses. Sacred \nHeart has offered an elective course on Pope St. John Paul IIโs teachings called the \nTheology of the Body. Ex. 10, Theology of the Body. \n  8\n\nCase 1:22-cv-01214   ECF No. 1,  PageID.9   Filed 12/22/22   Page 9 of 74\n49.  The Theology of the Body course explicitly lays out the Churchโs \nteaching on sexuality and marriage, but these teachings are also woven throughout \nthe entire Sacred Heart curriculum. \n50.  Sacred Heart seeks to protect its autonomy by remaining completely \nindependent of state and federal funding. The school does this to protect its \ndistinctly Catholic identity and intentional community. \nII.  Sacred Heart builds an intentional Catholic community around its \nfaculty and staff. \n51.  To pass on the Catholic faith to students, Sacred Heart requires all \nfaculty and staff to support, live, and model the Catholic faith and its doctrine and \nmorals. \n52.  Following diocesan policy, Sacred Heart requires all employees to \nbecome certified catechists, i.e., to be certified to teach the Catholic faith. \n53.  Sacred Heart Academy believes it is the job of every employee to \nsupport, live out, model, and teach the Catholic faith and its doctrine. \n54.  All Sacred Heart employees are Christians who support the Churchโs \nmoral and doctrinal teachings, including its teachings on marriage and human \nsexuality. Every year employees sign a โmemorandum of understandingโ outlining \ntheir religious and moral duties and they publicly swear an โoath of fidelityโ to \nChurch teaching at a Mass. Ex. 3, Faculty Memo and Oath. \n55.  Sacred Heartโs staff memorandum of understanding explains that the \nAcademy โis rooted in the reality that Truth is a person, Jesus Christ, and that \ncomplete formation of the human person necessarily requires formation of mind, \nbody, and soul.โ Ex. 3, Faculty Memo and Oath, at 1. \n56.  In the oath of fidelity, all employees swear to hold fast to the Catholic \nChurchโs deposit of faith in its entirety, faithfully hand it on and explain it, and \navoid any teachings contrary to it. Ex. 3, Faculty Memo and Oath at 4โ5. \n  9\n\nCase 1:22-cv-01214   ECF No. 1,  PageID.10   Filed 12/22/22   Page 10 of 74\n57.  Sacred Heart requires that its employees be responsible for integrating \nthe life of the Church and the organic unity of the Catholic faith into the curriculum \npresented to Sacred Heartโs students. Ex. 11, Faculty Handbook. \n58.  Sacred Heart requires its employees to fulfill their duties โall for the \npurpose of assisting in fulfilling the Academyโs mission of assisting families, \nforming Catholics, and cultivating culture.โ Ex. 3, Faculty Memo and Oath, at 1. \n59.  Sacred Heart maintains a standard of conduct for its employees and \nrequires them to agree that they will support and exemplify in conduct and \nexpression both Catholic doctrine and morality as articulated in the Catechism of \nthe Catholic Church. \n60.  Sacred Heartโs standard of conduct requires that employees must be \nconsistent, in expression and example, with the teaching and practice of the \nCatholic faith and shall not advocate, encourage, or counsel beliefs or practices that \nare inconsistent with the Catholic faith. \n61.  Sacred Heart has adopted these requirements because the Catholic \nfaith is better transmitted to and retained by young people when they are exposed \nto an authentic Catholic community living out Christian principles. \n62.  If churches and religious organizations cannot limit their membership \nto those who support and believe in an organizationโs or communityโs culture and \nmission, it changes and undermines those institutions. \n63.  Sacred Heart embraces the Catholic doctrine that all people should be \ntreated with dignity, respect, and charityโeven those who reject the Churchโs \nteachings. C.C.C. ยถ 2358. Sacred Heart therefore always strives to treat all persons, \nincluding employees, students, and families with dignity, respect, and charity. \n  10 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-01214   ECF No. 1,  PageID.11   Filed 12/22/22   Page 11 of 74\nIII.  Sacred Heart embraces the Catholic Churchโs teachings on marriage \nand human sexuality in belief and practice. \n64.  The Catholic Church (โthe Churchโ) exists to make the living Christ \npresent in the world today, and to provide onlookers with a glimpse of a society \ncomprised of persons living as disciples of Jesus Christ. \n65.  The Church understands itself as a communion of people called by God \nto be an assembly for religious purposes.  \n66.  The Church teaches that proper love of God and neighbor must be \nrooted in truth. \n67.  Jesus Christ called on his disciples to love one another in every aspect \nof their lives, including human sexuality and marriage. \n68.  The Churchโs doctrine on human sexuality and marriage are based in \nSacred Scripture and Tradition and supported by natural law. The Church believes \nits doctrine promotes the best vision of human flourishing by encouraging \nresponsible and selfless love and respect of others. The Churchโs doctrine on human \nsexuality and marriage facilitate love, freedom, dignity, and equality. \n69.  Catholic doctrine states that โGod created man in his own image . . . \nmale and female he created them.โ C.C.C. ยถ 2331.  \n70.  Catholic doctrine states that human sexuality is a unitive and \nprocreative gift reflecting the nature of God and that sexual acts are exclusively \nreserved for the loving and permanent bond of marriage, which can only exist \nbetween one man and one woman. C.C.C. ยถ 2332.  \n71.  Catholic doctrine also states that all sexual activity outside of \nmarriage is gravely sinful. C.C.C. ยถยถ 2396, 2400. \n72.  The Churchโs doctrine on human sexuality and marriage are \nfoundational and essential to the Catholic faith. They help Catholics understand \n  11 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-01214   ECF No. 1,  PageID.12   Filed 12/22/22   Page 12 of 74\nwho God is, as a Trinity of communal love, and it helps men and women understand \ntheir own identities as beloved sons and daughters of God. C.C.C. ยถ 2331.  \n73.  Catholic doctrine also instructs Catholics how to selflessly love their \nneighbors and to imitate Godโs radical love for us. C.C.C. ยถ 2346. \n74.  The Catholic faith rejects the notion that a man or woman can \nโtransitionโ to a gender inconsistent with his or her biological sex.  \n75.  Catholic doctrine states that โ[e]veryone, man and woman, should \nacknowledge and accept his sexual identityโ and that โ[e]ach of the two sexes is an \nimage of the power and tenderness of God, with equal dignity though in a different \nway.โ C.C.C. ยถยถ 2333, 2335. \n76.  Transgender ideology (i.e. the idea that a personโs identity can be \ninconsistent with his or her biological sex) undercuts Catholic doctrine on basic \nstructures of Catholic belief. See Congregation for Catholic Education, Male and \nFemale He Created Them: Towards a Path of Dialogue on the Question of Gender \nTheory in Education (2019). \n77.  In response to guidelines issued by the Michigan State Board of \nEducation, the Bishop of Grand Rapids, David J. Walkowiak, issued a statement \nexplaining that transgender ideology is incongruent with Catholic teaching and that \nCatholic schools โwill stand firm in our belief that all humans are created in the \nimage and likeness of God, male and femaleโ and that โa personโs sexual identity is \ndetermined at conception.โ Ex. 4, Bishop Statement. \n78.  Sacred Heartโs teaching methods reflect Catholic doctrine that \nmankind is created in two distinct but complementary sexes, male and female. \n79.  Sacred Heart requires all employees to embrace and follow the \nChurchโs doctrine on marriage and human sexuality. \n80.  In modeling the Catholic faith, doctrine, and morals to students, \nSacred Heartโs faculty and staff also model authentic masculinity and femininity by \n  12 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-01214   ECF No. 1,  PageID.13   Filed 12/22/22   Page 13 of 74\ndemonstrating to young boys and girls what it means to be a Catholic man or \nwoman. \n81.  Sacred Heart wrestles with the same cultural issues as other schools, \npublic and private. However, Sacred Heart addresses all issues from a Catholic \nperspective, always seeking to embrace and convey the transcendentals of truth, \ngoodness, and beauty, which reflect the infinite perfection of God. C.C.C. ยถ 41. \n82.  Sacred Heart believes and embraces Catholic doctrine on marriage and \nhuman sexuality. Sacred Heart rejects ideologies that are incompatible with \nCatholic doctrine, like transgender ideology. \n83.  Sacred Heart employs religious and lay persons as teachers and other \nstaff members. It hires new teachers each year and advertises open employment \npositions on its website and on third-party sites as positions arise. Sacred Heartโs \nemployment advertisements emphasize a requirement that employees believe, \nsupport, and model the Catholic faith. \n84.  Sacred Heart requires all employees to avoid all beliefs or practices \ninconsistent with Catholic doctrine or morals. \n85.  Sacred Heart would not approve an employeeโs request for special \ntreatment based in transgender ideology or other LGBTQ ideologies, such as using \npronouns or bathrooms inconsistent with the employeeโs biological sex, because \nthose ideologies conflict with and are incompatible with the Catholic vision of the \nhuman person and human flourishing. Doing so would be inconsistent with its \nmission and Catholic doctrine. \n86.  Sacred Heartโs job postings explain that employees are required to be \npracticing Catholics whose public lives are lived in conformity with the moral \nteachings of the Church. Ex. 5, Previous Job Postings. \n87.  For example, as part of their job descriptions, teachers are expected to \nโintegrat[e] Jesus Christ, the life of the Church and the organic unity of the \n  13 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-01214   ECF No. 1,  PageID.14   Filed 12/22/22   Page 14 of 74\nCatholic faith into the curriculum and classroom environment.โ Ex. 5, Previous Job \nPostings, at 1. \n88.  Notwithstanding the Michigan Supreme Courtโs recent decision \nexpanding Michiganโs โsex-discriminationโ laws to cover sexual orientation and \ngender identity, Sacred Heart plans to continue to communicate its commitment to \noperating consistent with Catholic beliefs to job candidates, its students, families, \nand the public. Ex. 7, Statement on Catholic Doctrine. \n89.  Sacred Heart incorporates Catholic beliefs on human sexuality into its \noperation of the Academy. \n90.  Sacred Heart divides its high school students into single-sex \nโhouseholdsโ or โhousesโ to build up community, train older students in leadership, \nand provide mentorship for younger students. \n91.  Sacred Heart divides students by sex in houses due to its commitment \nto Catholic teaching on the distinctness and complementarity of each sex.  \n92.  Sacred Heart maintains separate restroom facilities for males and \nfemales. \n93.  Sacred Heart maintains separate athletic teams for males and females. \n94.  Sacred Heart organizes houses, restrooms, and sports teams by \nbiological sex to reflect the truth that each person is made in Godโs image and \nlikeness as male or female, to help the students learn their identity as beloved sons \nor daughters of God, and to model authentic Christian masculinity or femininity. \n95.  Sacred Heart has students who struggle with gender discordance (also \nknown as gender dysphoria). \n96.  Sacred Heart works to help all students find their identity in Christ as \nbeloved sons or daughters of God. \n97.  When discussing Catholic schools and Michiganโs LGBTQ student \nguidance, the Bishop of Grand Rapids, David J. Walkowiak, explained that โ[i]n \n  14 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-01214   ECF No. 1,  PageID.15   Filed 12/22/22   Page 15 of 74\nsituations where students may be questioning their identity; parents and educators \nwill work together closely to determine the proper support necessary to meet the \nneeds of these and all students.โ Ex. 4, Bishop Statement. \n98.  Sacred Heart cannot embrace transgender ideology because that \nideology does not reflect the truth and is inconsistent with Catholic doctrine and the \nChurchโs vision for human flourishing. \n99.  Sacred Heart cannot embrace a vision of marriage and human \nsexuality that is inconsistent with Catholic doctrine because that undermines \nSacred Heartโs vision of human flourishing and harms men, women, children, and \nfamilies.  \n100.  Sacred Heart always strives to treat students with dignity, respect, \nand sensitivity, especially as students grow and seek to find their identities. See \nCongregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, Letter to the Bishops of the Catholic \nChurch on the Pastoral Care of Homosexual Persons (Oct. 1, 1986), \nhttps://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_\ndoc_19861001_homosexual-persons_en.html.  \n101.  Sacred Heart encourages students to embrace their God-given \nbiological sex because it leads to their fulfillment, helps them flourish, and helps \nthem understand their identities as beloved sons or daughters of God. \n102.  Sacred Heart does not approve or grant student requests to use a \nrestroom, wear uniforms, or play on a sports team inconsistent with that studentโs \nbiological sex. Doing so would be inconsistent with the Catholic faith and doctrine. \n103.  Sacred Heart will not grant student requests that are inconsistent \nwith its mission and Catholic doctrine. Sacred Heart will not grant requests based \nin transgender or other LGBTQ ideologies because those ideologies conflict with and \nare inconsistent with human flourishing and Catholic doctrine on the human \nperson.  \n  15 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-01214   ECF No. 1,  PageID.16   Filed 12/22/22   Page 16 of 74\n104.  Sacred Heart will not affirm a โgender identityโ that is inconsistent \nwith the personโs biological sex because doing so would contradict the Catholic faith \nand its doctrine. It would ultimately harm Sacred Heart students and staff. It also \nwould require lying to the person in question and others, which would be sinful. See \nC.C.C. ยถ 2485 (โBy its very nature, lying is to be condemned. It is a profanation of \nspeech, whereas the purpose of speech is to communicate known truth to others. \nThe deliberate intention of leading a neighbor into error by saying things contrary \nto the truth constitutes a failure in justice and charity.โ). \n105.  Sacred Heart will not affirm any individualโs โpreferred pronounsโ \ninconsistent with biological sex because that would conflict with the Catholic faith \nand its doctrine, lie about the personโs identity, and deter the personโs authentic \nflourishing. \n106.  Sacred Heart will not operate in a manner inconsistent with Catholic \nteachings in provision of educational services, in employment, or in any services \noffered to the public. Sacred Heart will therefore not grant or assent to requests for \nspecial treatment by students, employees, or others based on transgender or other \nLGBTQ ideologies. \n107.  Sacred Heart would shut down its schoolโthereby refraining from \nexercising its religion by providing educationโrather than operate a school \ninconsistent with the Churchโs faith and doctrine. \n108.  Many families have chosen Sacred Heart and have made sacrifices to \nsend their children to Sacred Heart precisely because of its fidelity to the Catholic \nfaith and its doctrine. \n  16 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-01214   ECF No. 1,  PageID.17   Filed 12/22/22   Page 17 of 74\nIV.  The Parents who choose Sacred Heart. \nA.  The Hatley Family \n109.  Jerry and Robin Hatley are members of the Sacred Heart community. \nThey have nine children, including the six youngest who all currently attend Sacred \nHeart Academy.  \n110.  The Hatleys currently have children in eleventh grade, ninth grade, \neighth grade, sixth grade, fourth grade, and kindergarten.  \n111.  The Hatleys have made significant sacrifices logistically and \nfinancially so that they can fulfill their religious obligation to teach their children in \nthe Catholic faith. \n112.  Previously, the Hatleys lived in Indianapolis, Indiana, but they felt \ntheir spiritual needs were not being met in that community. \n113.  Jerry and Robin asked God to show them where they should move to \nbetter raise their children in the Catholic faith, and they discerned that God was \ncalling them to join the Sacred Heart community. \n114.  When they visited Sacred Heart, the headmaster took time off vacation \nto spend two hours with them showing them around campus and discussing their \nneeds. \n115.  It was very important to the Hatleys that all of their children would be \nable to attend the same school.  \n116.  Even though a grade level for one of their children was filled at Sacred \nHeart, the headmaster accommodated the Hatleys so that all of their children could \nattend Sacred Heart together. \n117.  The Hatleys moved from Indianapolis to Grand Rapids specifically to \nform their children in the Catholic faith as members of the Sacred Heart \ncommunity. There was no other reason for them to move to Grand Rapids. \n  17 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-01214   ECF No. 1,  PageID.18   Filed 12/22/22   Page 18 of 74\n118.  Both Jerry and Robin are actively involved at Sacred Heart. For \nexample, Jerry serves on the Board of Directors of the Sacred Heart Academy \nEducational Foundation. And Robin serves on the Auction Committee. She also \nassists with school picnics, the hot lunch program, and various celebrations for \nCatholic feast days throughout the school year. \n119.  The Hatley children have attended Sacred Heart for three years. \n120.  Even though Jerry and Robin both attended public school, they have \nopted out of public education and chosen Catholic school so that their children can \nreceive a rich moral and spiritual foundation as part of their academic formation. \n121.  Jerry has been in the manufacturing field for 30 years and has seen \nfirsthand the effects of children raised without a solid moral and spiritual \nfoundation.  \n122.  Jerry and Robin have chosen Sacred Heart so that their children can \npreserve their innocence and learn what is good, true, and beautiful without any \nexposure to harmful ideas that contradict the truth of the Catholic faith. \n123.  The Hatleys have seen spiritual fruit in their childrenโs lives as a \nresult of the Sacred Heart community. \n124.  Their children have flourished at Sacred Heart and have been able to \nlive their Catholic faith more freely and fully surrounded by their peers, teachers, \nand other families who all are striving together for holiness. \n125.  The Hatleys believe Sacred Heart is the best place where they can \nsend their children to receive a holistic moral, spiritual, and academic formation in \nthe Catholic faith. Sacred Heartโs community uniquely fills their familyโs spiritual \nneeds. \n  18 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-01214   ECF No. 1,  PageID.19   Filed 12/22/22   Page 19 of 74\nB.  The Boutell Family \n126.  Joe and Renee Boutell are members of the Sacred Heart community. \nThey have five adopted children who all attend Sacred Heart Academy.  \n127.  They have two ninth graders, a sixth grader, a fourth grader, and a \nsecond grader.  \n128.  Joe is a public safety officer, and Renee stays home to care for their \nfive children, all of whom have special needs. In January Renee will be starting a \npart-time position with Help Pregnancy Resource Center, which is about a mile \nfrom Sacred Heart and will allow her to still be very involved in the school. \n129.  The Boutells live 40 minutes away from Sacred Heart and drive their \nchildren to and from school every day. \n130.  The Boutells have bought a house about 20 minutes from Sacred Heart \nand are currently renovating it. \n131.  When the Boutells move into their new home, Joeโs commute to work \nwill increase from 35 minutes to one hour each way. \n132.  The Boutells have made significant logistical and financial sacrifices so \nthat their children can attend Sacred Heart. \n133.  Both Joe and Renee spend much time volunteering at Sacred Heart. \n134.  For example, Renee volunteers on the โLiturgical Celebration Team,โ a \nteam that works to integrate the life of the Church into the school by, for example, \nhosting special celebrations for the school in honor of Catholic feast days.  \n135.  And Joe is part of the Security Team for the Parish. \n136.  Both Joe and Renee are also members of the New Family Team where \nthey give tours of the school and serve as resources for new Sacred Heart families. \n137.  Before the Boutell children attended Sacred Heart, they attended a \nnon-Catholic classical school, and the Boutells were generally pleased with this \nschool. \n  19 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-01214   ECF No. 1,  PageID.20   Filed 12/22/22   Page 20 of 74\n138.  But when Sacred Heart was re-founded as a classical Catholic school in \n2013, Joe and Renee did not hesitate to pull their children from their prior school \nand enroll them at Sacred Heart.  \n139.  The Boutells have chosen to send their five children to Sacred Heart \nbecause of the authentic Catholic community, the genuine charity, and the \nformation in virtue that they experience at Sacred Heart.  \n140.  For the Boutell children, the rigorous academics at Sacred Heart have \nbeen challenging because of their special needs. \n141.  Public schools offer more targeted learning for children with special \nneeds, but the Boutells have opted out of public school in order to give their children \nan authentic Catholic education. Their youngest child does have an individualized \neducation plan and receives special instruction one hour per week through Grand \nRapids Public Schools. But the instructor comes to Sacred Heart to work with him \nso that he remains in the Catholic community at Sacred Heart and is not exposed to \na culture that contradicts the Catholic faith in a public school. \n142.  Before this school year, Joe and Renee seriously considered pulling \ntheir oldest child from Sacred Heart because of the academic challenge. \n143.  But Joe and Renee ultimately decided that the truth, goodness, and \nbeauty of the holistic Catholic education at Sacred Heart outweighed any academic \nchallenges.  \n144.  Despite the academic challenges, the Boutells keep their children at \nSacred Heart because of the access to the seven Sacraments, including daily \nEucharist, and because everything about Sacred Heart points to and flows from the \nsacramental life of the Catholic Church.  \n145.  The unique Catholic community at Sacred Heart, formed by the \npriests, teachers, and families, foster a true spirit of charity that aids the Boutell \nchildren in living out and experiencing their Catholic faith.  \n  20 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-01214   ECF No. 1,  PageID.21   Filed 12/22/22   Page 21 of 74\n146.  The Boutells value the preparation that Sacred Heart gives to children \nwith disabilities, like the Boutell children, who may not go to college. \n147.  For example, Sacred Heart helps its students to discern their vocations \nand to transition into those vocations after graduation. \n148.  The Boutells also value the strong Catholic foundation that Sacred \nHeart provides for their children. \n149.  The school is truly an extension of the parish, which provides essential \nCatholic community for their children that allows them to flourish. \n150.  Joe and Renee believe that even after their children leave the school, \nthe relationships that the Boutell children have built with priests, teachers, friends, \nand families at Sacred Heart will last and help them continue to live out their \nCatholic faith in the world. \n151.  The Boutells believe that Sacred Heart is the only place where they \ncan send their children to receive a holistic moral, spiritual, and academic formation \nin the Catholic faith. \nC.  The Ugolini Family \n152.  Peter and Katie Ugolini are members of the Sacred Heart community. \nThey have four children. Their oldest recently graduated from Sacred Heart, and \ntheir three youngest currently attend Sacred Heart. \n153.  The Ugolinis currently have children in eleventh, ninth, and eighth \ngrade at Sacred Heart. \n154.  Peter and Katie Ugolini are both medical doctors. Peter maintains a \nbusy practice and Katie currently serves as a biology teacher at Sacred Heart.  \n155.  When their oldest child was ready to attend school, Peter and Katie \nsent him to a public school. \n  21 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-01214   ECF No. 1,  PageID.22   Filed 12/22/22   Page 22 of 74\n156.  After one year in public school, they determined that it was not right \nfor their family because of the lack of essential moral and spiritual formation so \nthey decided to opt out of public education. \n157.  Eventually, Katie, a trained plastic surgeon, stopped practicing \nmedicine and homeschooled their four children.  \n158.  After four years of homeschooling, the Ugolinis began participating in \nthe Classical Enrichment Curriculum program at Sacred Heart, which allows \nhomeschooled children at the parish to take courses at Sacred Heart Academy two \ndays per week. \n159.  Through this program, their children became more involved in the \nSacred Heart community. \n160.  Their oldest son thrived in this community as an altar server at Mass \nand through sports teams, and he asked his parents if he could attend Sacred Heart \nfull-time.  \n161.  Eventually, the Ugolinis enrolled all of their children at Sacred Heart \nfull-time. \n162.  The Ugolinis chose Sacred Heart because the Catholic faith is \nparamount and permeates every aspect of the academics, community, and culture.  \n163.  They value the authentic Catholic message that their children receive \neach day as part of the Sacred Heart community. \n164.  The Ugolinis live right across the street from one of the best public \nhigh schools in the state, but each day they drive by that school to take their \nchildren to Sacred Heart 20 minutes away instead. \n165.  The Ugolinis believe that in a public school, their children will not be \nformed in the Catholic faith because they will not hear the Gospel preached or learn \nby the example of teachers and peers trying to genuinely live the faith. \n  22 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-01214   ECF No. 1,  PageID.23   Filed 12/22/22   Page 23 of 74\n166.  At Sacred Heart, though, the Ugolinis have found that the teachers \nmodel the faith for their students by showing them how to be virtuous Catholic men \nand women striving to be more like Christ. \n167.  The Ugolinis also appreciate that their children receive formation and \nencouragement to strive for holiness from their peers.  \n168.  Peter and Katie have made significant financial and logistical \nsacrifices so that their children can attend Sacred Heart. \n169.  Peter has dedicated many hours to helping the sports programs thrive \nso that their children and others can participate in organized sports at Sacred \nHeart. \n170.  Katie has given up her career as a plastic surgeon so that she can \nbetter serve her children, including by teaching biology, anatomy, and physiology at \nSacred Heart. \n171.  This year, two of the Ugolini children are in Katieโs classes. \n172.  As a science teacher at Sacred Heart, everything that Katie teaches \nher students aligns with the teachings of the Catholic Church. \n173.  For example, she teaches her students that every personโs biological \nsex is immutable. \n174.  But the Act prohibits Katie from teaching science classes in accord \nwith Catholic doctrine and would even require her to teach about biological sex in a \nway that directly contradicts the Catholic faith by, for example, using pronouns \ninconsistent with a studentโs biological sex if the student requests it. \n175.  Because Katieโs children take her class, the Act also prohibits Katie \nfrom teaching science classes in accord with Catholic doctrine to her own children \nand would even require her to teach her own children about biological sex in a way \nthat directly contradicts the Catholic faith. \n  23 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-01214   ECF No. 1,  PageID.24   Filed 12/22/22   Page 24 of 74\n176.  The Ugolinis have also assisted with formal dances for the high school \nstudents. \n177.  At these dances, the Ugolinis have seen the students put into practice \nwhat they have learned at school and at home by exercising the virtues of modesty, \ncharity, and respect and encouraging their classmates to live virtuously.  \n178.  Sacred Heart is the only place where the Ugolinis can send their \nchildren to receive a holistic moral, spiritual, and academic formation in the \nCatholic faith. \nD.  Parent Plaintiffsโ Religious Beliefs \n179.  The Hatleys, Boutells, and Ugolinis are all practicing Catholics.3 They \nbelieve all the teachings of the Catholic Church, including the Churchโs teaching on \nmarriage and sexuality, and they are raising their children in the Catholic faith. \n180.  The Hatleys, Boutells, and Ugolinis believe it is their religious and \nmoral obligation to help their children know, love, and serve God in this world and \nbe happy with Him forever in Heaven. Baltimore Catechism, Question 6. \n181.  According to the Catechism of the Catholic Church, โ[t]he fecundity of \nconjugal love cannot be reduced solely to the procreation of children, but must \nextend to their moral education and their spiritual formation. The role of parents in \neducation is of such importance that it is almost impossible to provide an adequate \nsubstitute. The right and duty of parents to educate their children are primordial \nand inalienable.โ C.C.C. ยถ 2221 (internal citation omitted). \n182.  The Church also teaches that โ[p]arents have the first responsibility \nfor the education of their children,โ id. ยถ 2223, and โparents have the duty of \nchoosing schools that will best help them in their task as Christian educators,โ id. \nยถ 2229. \n \n3 Where appropriate within this complaint, the Hatleys, Boutells, and Ugolinis are \ncollectively referred to as โParent Plaintiffs.โ \n  24 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-01214   ECF No. 1,  PageID.25   Filed 12/22/22   Page 25 of 74\n183.  The Hatleys, Boutells, and Ugolinis have exercised their religious right \nand duty to form their children in the Catholic faith by choosing to send them to \nSacred Heart. \n184.  Sacred Heart exists to assist parents in fulfilling their religious \nobligation to educate their children in the Catholic faith through academic, moral, \nand spiritual formation. \n185.  Sacred Heart follows the Churchโs teaching that โ[t]he Church is bound \nas a mother to give to these children of hers an education by which their whole life \ncan be imbued with the spirit of Christ and at the same time do all she can to \npromote for all peoples the complete perfection of the human person, the good of \nearthly society and the building of a world that is more human.โ Gravissiumum \nEducationis: Declaration on Christian Education (Oct. 28, 1965). \n186.  The Hatleys, Boutells, and Ugolinis believe that the Eucharist, the \ntrue Body and Blood of Christ, is the โsource and summit of the Christian life.โ \nC.C.C. ยถ 1324. \n187.  So it is essential to their childrenโs spiritual well-being that their \nchildren be able to receive the Eucharist at Mass at the beginning of each school \nday at Sacred Heart. \n188.  The Hatleys, Boutells, and Ugolinis believe that formation in the \nCatholic faith comes not just from formal catechesis but also from learning by the \nexample of others authentically living the Catholic faith. \n189.  So it is essential to their childrenโs spiritual well-being that their \nchildren be surrounded by a true, good, and beautiful Catholic culture at school \nwhere students, teachers, priests, and families all strive for holiness together. \n190.  At Sacred Heart, students learn the Catholic faith by observing their \nteachers living truly Catholic lives in faithfulness to the teachings of the Church, \nincluding those on marriage and sexuality.  \n  25 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-01214   ECF No. 1,  PageID.26   Filed 12/22/22   Page 26 of 74\n191.  Students also learn the Catholic faith through having relationships \nwith priests and consecrated religious brothers and sisters involved in Sacred \nHeart. \n192.  Students also learn the Catholic faith from their peers. In particular, \nthe older students at Sacred Heart often become role models of virtue for younger \nstudents.  \n193.  And Sacred Heart fosters a culture of accountability among the \nstudents where they encourage each other to live virtuously and grow spiritually in \naccordance with the teachings of the Church.  \n194.  Sacred Heart provides opportunities, during school, for students to live \nout their faith in the community by participating in corporal and spiritual works of \nmercy such as feeding the hungry and praying for the dead.  \n195.  All of this is necessary religious formation for Parent Plaintiffsโ \nchildren. \n196.  The Catholic Church teaches that โ[p]arents have the mission of \nteaching their children to pray and to discover their vocation as children of God.โ \nC.C.C. ยถ 2226.  \n197.  The Hatleys, Boutells, and Ugolinis have chosen Sacred Heart because \nit helps prepare their children for their vocations. \n198.  For example, students at Sacred Heart learn about the vocation of \nmarriage through observing their teachers and staff model true, chaste courtship \nthat results in sacramental marriage in the Catholic Church. \n199.  In their own lives then, students follow this chaste courtship model in \npreparation for marriage rather than the mainstream dating model that encourages \nsexual relations outside of conjugal marriage. \n  26 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-01214   ECF No. 1,  PageID.27   Filed 12/22/22   Page 27 of 74\n200.  Students learn about the truth, goodness, and beauty of conjugal \nmarriage from watching their teachers flourish in their own marriages and even \nattending their teachersโ nuptial Masses. \n201.  Students at Sacred Heart also learn about the vocation of priesthood \nand religious life by interacting with priests and consecrated religious brothers and \nsisters at school. \n202.  The altar serving program at Sacred Heart allows male students to \nassist the priest during the celebration of the Mass. It is a source of pride for young \nmen and helps them discern if they are called to the priesthood. \n203.  The Hatleys, Boutells, and Ugolinis have chosen to send their children \nto Sacred Heart to assist them in fulfilling their religious duty to help their children \nget to Heaven. \n204.  The Hatleys, Boutells, and Ugolinis believe the teachings of the \nCatholic Church that God created each person in His image either male or female \nand that biological sex is immutable. \n205.  They also believe the teachings of the Catholic Church that marriage \ncan only exist between one man and one woman and that any sexual acts outside of \nthis procreative, permanent, and exclusive union are gravely sinful.  \n206.  The Hatleys, Boutells, and Ugolinis teach these truths to their \nchildren. \n207.  The Hatleys, Boutells, and Ugolinis have sent their children to Sacred \nHeart because of the clear Catholic teaching, through class instruction and \nexample, that their children receive on marriage and sexuality. \n208.  Public schools teach messages, ideas, and ideologies that directly \ncontradict the truths of the Catholic faith on marriage and sexuality. Ex. 6, \nMichigan Education Policy; see also, e.g., Michigan Dept. of Education LGBTQ, \nGender Training Blasted by Dixon, Whitmer, Bridge Michigan (Sept. 16, 2022), \n  27 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-01214   ECF No. 1,  PageID.28   Filed 12/22/22   Page 28 of 74\nhttps://www.bridgemi.com/talent-education/michigan-dept-education-lgbtq-gender-\ntraining-blasted-dixon-whitmer.  \n209.  The Hatleys, Boutells, and Ugolinis have opted out of public school so \nthat their children are not taught these harmful ideas about marriage and \nsexuality. \n210.  They believe that if a Catholic institution, like Sacred Heart, was \nforced to affirm positions contrary to the Churchโs teachings on marriage and \nsexuality, it would greatly confuse their impressionable children and hinder their \nmoral and spiritual development. \n211.  The Hatleys, Boutells, and Ugolinis send their children to Sacred \nHeart so they can learn the truth, goodness, and beauty of the Churchโs teachings \non marriage and sexuality and because they will not be exposed to anything that \ncontradicts or confuses Catholic teaching. \n212.  If Sacred Heart was forced to teach, in word or example, content that \nviolated the teachings of the Catholic Church, then the Hatleys, Boutells, and \nUgolinis would remove their children from the school. \nV.  Michiganโs Civil Rights Act governs Sacred Heart and bans sex and \nreligious discrimination in education, employment, and public \naccommodations. \n213.  Michiganโs Elliot-Larsen Civil Rights Act (โthe Actโ) is a broad-\nreaching law that prohibits discrimination on a variety of bases in education, \nemployment, and public accommodations. \n214.  Among other things, the Act prohibits sex and religious discrimination \nin education, employment, and public accommodations.  \n215.  The Act applies to church-run schools. See Porth v. Roman Cath. \nDiocese of Kalamazoo, 532 N.W.2d 195, 198 (1995). \n  28 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-01214   ECF No. 1,  PageID.29   Filed 12/22/22   Page 29 of 74\n216.   The Actโs education, employment, and public accommodations \nprovisions apply to Sacred Heart. \n217.  Michiganโs education discrimination prohibition explicitly covers \nprivate schools, including Sacred Heart Academy. M.C.L. ยงยง 37.2401. \n218.  The Actโs education provision expressly forbids sex discrimination in \nstudent admission, retention, or discipline. M.C.L. ยงยง 37.2402(b). \n219.  The Act also prohibits discrimination based on religion, but religious \nschools are only exempted from the religious discrimination ban. M.C.L. ยงยง 37.2403. \nReligious schools are not exempted from the discrimination prohibition based on \nother classes, including sex. Id. \n220.  The Act prohibits employment discrimination, which it defines as \nโfail[ing] or refus[ing] to hire or recruit, discharge, or otherwise discriminateโ based \non, among other things, sex. M.C.L. ยงยง 37.2202. The Act prohibits treating \nemployees differently based on sex. Id. \n221.  The Act defines an employer as any person who employs one or more \nindividuals, which includes Sacred Heart. M.C.L. ยง 37.2201(a). \n222.  The Act provides employers a bona fide occupational qualification \n(โBFOQโ) exemption, which allows some employers to petition government officials \nfor permission to discriminate on grounds relevant to the performance of a job. \n223.  The Act prohibits discrimination in public accommodations, which \nincludes educational facilities or institutions and any institution โwhose goods, \nservices, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations are extended, offered, \nsold, or otherwise made available to the public.โ M.C.L. ยง ยง 37.2301. The Actโs public \naccommodations provision includes sex, religion, and marital status as protected \nclasses. M.C.L. ยง ยง 37.2302(a). \n224.  The Actโs provisions governing education, employment, and public \naccommodations all include โpublication bans,โ which are provisions that prevent \n  29 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-01214   ECF No. 1,  PageID.30   Filed 12/22/22   Page 30 of 74\ncovered entities from making communications contrary to the lawโs values. See \nM.C.L. ยง ยง 37.2402(d) (education); M.C.L. ยงยง 37.2206 (employment); M.C.L. \nยงยง 37.2302(b) (public accommodations).  \n225.  Unlike most similar state and federal laws, Michiganโs Act does not \ninclude routine religious exemptions that allow Sacred Heart to operate consistent \nwith the Catholic faith and its doctrine. \nVI.  Michiganโs Penal Code also governs Sacred Heart. \n226.  Like the Act, Michiganโs penal code also imposes penalties on public \naccommodations for religion or sex discrimination. M.C.L. ยง 750.146, 750.147. \n227.  The penal code applies to all โplaces of public accommodation,โ but \ndoes not specifically define what public accommodations are. \n228.  The penal code prohibits the refusal of accommodations and services. It \nalso includes a publication ban restricting communications indicating a refusal of \naccommodations and services. M.C.L. ยง 750.147. \n229.  The penal codeโs publication ban makes it illegal for public \naccommodations to โdirectly or indirectly publish, circulate, issue, display, post or \nmail any written or printed communicationsโ indicating a refusal of services in \nviolation of the code. M.C.L. ยง 750.147. \n230.  Each violation of the penal code can potentially result in fines of $100 \nand/or fifteen days prison time. It also can expose public accommodations to civil \nliability and to treble damages for each offense. M.C.L. ยง 750.147. \nVII.  Michiganโs legal redefinition of โsex.โ \n231.  In May 2018, the Commission reinterpreted the Actโs prohibition on \ndiscrimination โbecause of sexโ to include sexual orientation and gender identity in \nMichigan Civil Rights Commission, Interpretative Statement 2018โ1 (2018), \nhttps://bit.ly/3yGdHdM.  \n  30 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-01214   ECF No. 1,  PageID.31   Filed 12/22/22   Page 31 of 74\n232.  The Commission investigated two businesses for alleged \ndiscrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity in 2019. See \nComplaint, Rouch World, LLC v. Mich. Depโt of C.R., No. 20โ000145โMZ (Mich. Ct. \nCl. July 28, 2020). \n233.  The businesses under investigation challenged the Interpretive \nStatementโs conclusion that โsexโ includes sexual orientation or gender identity by \nfiling a complaint for declaratory judgment and injunctive relief in August 2020. Id. \n234.  In December 2020, a Michigan Court of Claims held that โsexโ includes \ngender identity, but not sexual orientation. The court invalidated the Interpretative \nStatementโs conclusion that sex includes sexual orientation. See Rouch World, LLC \nv. Mich. Depโt of C.R., No. 20โ000145โMZ (Mich. Ct. Cl. Dec. 7, 2020).  \n235.  The Department appealed the Michigan Court of Claimsโ decision on \nsexual orientation discrimination directly to the Michigan Supreme Court, which \ndecided Rouch World, LLC v. Department of Civil Rights on July 28, 2022. See No. \n162482, 2022 WL 3007805.  \n236.  The Michigan Supreme Court held that โdiscrimination on the basis of \nsexual orientation necessarily involves discrimination because of sex in violation of \n[Michigan civil rights law].โ Id. at *11. \n237.  A dissenting justice in Rouch World specifically noted that Michiganโs \ncivil-rights law does not contain any exemptions for religious organizations. Id. at \n*43 (Viviano, J., dissenting). The dissenting justice criticized the majority for its \nlack of โany concern for whether that interpretation violates constitutional \nprotections of religious liberty.โ Id. \n238.  After the Court of Claimsโ and Michigan Supreme Courtโs decisions, \nโsex discriminationโ in Michigan law now includes sexual orientation and gender \nidentity. \n  31 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-01214   ECF No. 1,  PageID.32   Filed 12/22/22   Page 32 of 74\nVIII.  Sacred Heart cannot legally operate according to its religious beliefs \nunder Michiganโs re-understood Act and penal code.  \n239.  Michiganโs Act and penal code impose significant burdens on Sacred \nHeart and pressure it to change how it operates its school, how it manages \nemployment decisions, and how it communicates its Catholic faith. \n240.  Michiganโs laws do not contain an exemption for religious entities like \nSacred Heart with respect to the prohibitions on discrimination based on sex, sexual \norientation, gender identity, or marital status. \n241.  Sacred Heart would have to abandon its commitment to the Catholic \nChurchโs faith and doctrine in order to operate the school consistent with the Act \nand penal code. \n242.  If Sacred Heart must choose between operating consistent with \nCatholic teaching and closing the school, Sacred Heart will close the school. \n243.  Sacred Heartโs policies and practices violate Defendantsโ recent \ninterpretation of the Act and penal code. \n244.  Sacred Heart has had students who experienced gender discordance or \nsame-sex attraction and currently has at least one student who experiences gender \ndiscordance. Sacred Heart always ministers to all students with sensitivity, \ncompassion, and charity. Due to its commitment to student flourishing, personal \nfulfillment, and spiritual growth, Sacred Heart will not adopt policies, permit \nbehavior, or communicate messages that are inconsistent with the Catholic faith \nand its doctrine. \n245.  In employment, education, or in any services provided to the public, \nSacred Heart will not affirm gender identities, use pronouns, or allow any person to \nuse restrooms or participate in sex-specific activities inconsistent with his or her \nbiological sex. These practices are incompatible with living according to the Catholic \nfaith and its doctrine. \n  32 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-01214   ECF No. 1,  PageID.33   Filed 12/22/22   Page 33 of 74\n246.  The Actโs specific education, employment, and public accommodations \nprovisions make it illegal for Sacred Heart to operate its school consistent with the \nCatholic faith and its doctrine.  \nIX.  The Actโs education provisions threaten Sacred Heartโs religious \nexercise. \n247.  Sacred Heart Academy is an apostolate of Sacred Heart of Jesus \nParish, and it fulfills the parishโs evangelical mission to foster and transmit the \nCatholic faith and its doctrine and to cultivate Catholic culture.  \n248.  Sacred Heart understands itself as an extension of its familiesโ homes, \nand therefore it is necessary that the school community reflect the Catholic values \nthat families desire to live out.  \n249.  In order to form an intentional Catholic community, Sacred Heart only \nadmits students from practicing Catholic families or those from families who, \nthough not Catholic, desire Sacred Heartโs classical Catholic formation for their \nchildren. \n250.  To maintain an intentional Catholic community, all families interview \nwith Sacred Heartโs headmaster before their students are admitted. Sacred Heart \nAcademy generally admits students from practicing Catholic families after receiving \na reference from the familyโs Catholic parish. For families who are not practicing \nCatholics, Sacred Heart admits students only after an interview with Sacred \nHeartโs pastor, who confirms the familyโs desire for a Catholic education and \nformation for their child.  \n251.  Each year, parents and students are required to sign an agreement \nindicating that they will follow Sacred Heartโs policies that require students to live \nvirtuously according to Catholic doctrine. Ex. 2, Student Agreement. \n  33 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-01214   ECF No. 1,  PageID.34   Filed 12/22/22   Page 34 of 74\n252.  Under the re-understood Actโs education provisions, schools cannot \ndiscriminate in student admission, retention, or discipline on the basis of sex, \nsexual orientation, or gender identity. M.C.L. ยงยง 37.2402(b). \n253.  The re-understood Act makes it illegal for Sacred Heart to limit \nenrollment to build an intentional Catholic community. \n254.  Sacred Heartโs student admissions, retention, and discipline policies \nand practices violate the re-understood Act. \n255.  Sacred Heart does not admit or retain students who do not want to live \nin an intentional Catholic Christian community or those who will not cooperate \nwith Sacred Heartโs Catholic formation program.  \n256.  Sacred Heart admits and retains students who experience same sex \nattraction, gender confusion, or gender dysphoria, provided those students and their \nfamilies sincerely desire a Catholic formation and education. Sacred Heart helps all \nstudents to find their identities as beloved sons and daughters of God.  \n257.  However, Sacred Heart cannot admit or retain students who adopt \nsexual identities that conflict with the Catholic faith and its doctrine. \n258.  Sacred Heartโs student discipline policies are rooted in the Catechism \nof the Catholic Church, which teaches the Churchโs faith and doctrine. Sacred Heart \ndoes not allow behavior inconsistent with the Catholic faith and its doctrine. Sacred \nHeart seeks to correct student misbehavior to bring students fully back into its \nChristian community, and its policies cultivate studentsโ virtue.  \n259.  Sacred Heart does not allow students who willfully refuse to conform \ntheir behavior to or who persistently reject the Catholic faith and its doctrine to \ncontinue at the school. \n260.  Sacred Heart would not allow students whose behavior obstinately and \npublicly rejects the Catholic faith and its doctrine to remain in the school because it \nwould undermine Sacred Heartโs intentional Catholic community and mission and \n  34 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-01214   ECF No. 1,  PageID.35   Filed 12/22/22   Page 35 of 74\nharm the other studentsโ formation. This includes students who reject the Catholic \nfaith and its doctrine and adopt sexual identities inconsistent with Catholic \nteaching. \n261.  Because the legal interpretation of the Actโs prohibition on sex \ndiscrimination has been judicially changed to include sexual orientation and gender \nidentity, Sacred Heart wants to communicate its commitment to operating \nconsistent with the Catholic faith and its doctrine, including on marriage and \nhuman sexuality, to its families and the public, but the publication ban makes it \nillegal for Sacred Heart to do so. A copy of Sacred Heartโs desired communication is \nattached as Ex. 7, Statement on Catholic Doctrine. \n262.  The Actโs education provisions make it impossible for Sacred Heart to \nuse its admissions, retention, and student discipline policies to form an intentional \nCatholic community among its student population. \nX.  The Actโs employment provisions threaten Sacred Heartโs religious \nexercise.  \n263.  As an apostolate of the parish, Sacred Heart Academy exists to help \nparents form their children in the Catholic faith. It is therefore essential that all \npeople who work at Sacred Heart Academy support, live, and model the Catholic \nfaith to the schoolโs students and to each other. \n264.  Students are more likely to grow in the faith and retain it if they have \nbeen formed in a community where members support, live, and model the Churchโs \nfaith and doctrine. \n265.  Sacred Heart only recruits, hires, and retains employees who will be \ninvaluable members and leaders of its intentional Christian community and who \nsupport, live, and model the Catholic faith and its doctrine. \n  35 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-01214   ECF No. 1,  PageID.36   Filed 12/22/22   Page 36 of 74\n266.  But the Actโs employment provisions make it illegal for Sacred Heart \nto build an intentional Catholic community by ensuring that its employees support, \nlive out, and model the faith. \n267.  The Act prohibits Sacred Heart from limiting, segregating, or \nclassifying employees or applicants in a way that adversely affects their \nemployment or application status โbecause ofโ religion, sex, sexual orientation, \nmarital status, or gender identity. M.C.L. ยง 37.2202(1)(b). \n268.  Sacred Heart cannot, therefore, ensure that prospective employees \nsupport, model, and can effectively communicate the Churchโs faith and doctrine. \nNor can it exclusively recruit and hire candidates who commit to Catholic faith and \ndoctrine or decline to recruit and hire prospective employees who are unable or \nrefuse to do so.  \n269.  The Actโs employment provisions also prohibit Sacred Heart from \nmaintaining policies or practices of only recruiting and hiring candidates who \nsupport, live, and model Church teaching and declining to hire those who cannot or \nwill not. \n270.  The Actโs employment provisions make it illegal for Sacred Heart to \nimpose employment-related qualifications and responsibilities on any position and \nto treat candidates who do not support the Catholic faith and its doctrine differently \nfrom those who doโfor example, by screening applications on that basis. \n271.  The Act also prevents Sacred Heart from ensuring its current \nemployees live consistently with the Churchโs faith and doctrine and asking them to \nrecommit each year to living the Catholic faith. \n272.  The Act prohibits Sacred Heart from taking adverse employment \nactions against any employee who violates the employment memorandum of \nunderstanding. \n  36 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-01214   ECF No. 1,  PageID.37   Filed 12/22/22   Page 37 of 74\n273.  The Actโs publication bans prohibit employers from posting or \npublishing a statement related to employment โwhich indicates a preference, \nlimitation, specification, or discrimination, based on religion,โ โsex,โ โmarital \nstatus,โ sexual orientation, or gender identity. M.C.L. ยง 37.2206(1). \n274.  The publication ban prohibits employers from making or using a \nwritten or oral inquiry or application โthat elicits or attempts to elicit informationโ \nconcerning a prospective employeeโs religion or that โexpresses a preference, \nlimitation, specification, or discrimination based on religion,โ โsex,โ โmarital \nstatus,โ sexual orientation,โ or gender identity, or that keeps records of that \ninformation. M.C.L. ยง 37.2206(2). \n275.  The publication ban makes it illegal for Sacred Heart to ask candidates \nabout their commitment to supporting, living, modeling, and sharing the Catholic \nfaith and its doctrine. It means that Sacred Heart cannot ask prospective employees \nwhether they identify as a Catholic, the name of their Catholic parish, or their \nfrequency of Mass attendance.  \n276.  The publication ban prohibits Sacred Heart from posting employment \nopportunities on its website or other job-hunting sites which indicate a desire to \nrecruit and hire employees who share Sacred Heartโs Catholic faith.  \n277.  Sacred Heart is currently hiring employees and will hire more \nemployees in the spring. Sacred Heart wants to communicate to applicants its \ncommitment to Catholic faith, doctrine, and morals, including on marriage and \nhuman sexuality, but the Act prohibits Sacred Heart from publishing its statement. \nEx. 7, Statement on Catholic Doctrine. \n278.  For example, Sacred Heart is now in the process of hiring an art \nteacher. Advertising the position and its requisite Catholic values violates the Act, \nas re-interpreted. Sacred Heart has therefore refrained from posting the position \nand its Catholic beliefs. \n  37 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-01214   ECF No. 1,  PageID.38   Filed 12/22/22   Page 38 of 74\n279.  Sacred Heart will also be hiring an athletic coach for the spring and \nadvertising the position and its requisite Catholic values violates the Act, as re-\ninterpreted. Sacred Heart has therefore refrained from posting the position and its \nCatholic beliefs. \n280.  Sacred Heartโs description for the positions they wish to advertise but \nlegally cannot is attached as Ex. 9, Current Job Postings. \n281.  Sacred Heart will also hire new teachers for the next school year this \nspring and wants to communicate its commitment to the Catholic faith and its \ndoctrine, including on marriage and human sexuality, to applicants. Ex. 7, \nStatement on Catholic Doctrine. Sacred Heart cannot both do that and comply with \nthe Act and penal code. \n282.  Sacred Heart annually requires all employees to sign a memorandum \nof understanding that explains the Churchโs doctrine on, among other things, \nmarriage and human sexuality. The memorandum of understanding explains that \nall sexual activity outside of a marriage between one man and one woman and \ntransgender identification are contrary to the Catholic faith and its doctrine. Ex. 3, \nFaculty Memo and Oath, at 2.  \n283.  Sacred Heart also annually requires all employees to publicly swear an \noath of fidelity to Catholic doctrine, including on marriage and sexuality. Ex. 3, \nFaculty Memo and Oath, at 4โ5. \n284.  The publication ban makes it illegal for Sacred Heart to require \nemployees to sign its memorandum of understanding and to swear the oath of \nfidelity which ensures that employees support, live, and model the Catholic faith \nand its doctrine. \n285.  By restricting Sacred Heartโs ability to manage its employment \nrelationships according to the Catholic faith and its doctrine as described above, the \nActโs employment provisions and accompanying publication ban interfere with the \n  38 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-01214   ECF No. 1,  PageID.39   Filed 12/22/22   Page 39 of 74\nschoolโs ability to promote and model the faith to students, families, and the \ncommunity.  \n286.  The Act and penal code also undermine Sacred Heartโs religious \npurpose because they interfere with the schoolโs ability to form and maintain an \nintentional Catholic community of persons who seek to bring the living Christ into \nthe world by supporting and loving each other consistent with the Churchโs faith \nand doctrine.  \n287.  The Actโs employment provisions restrict Sacred Heartโs ability to \noperate consistent with Church doctrine, but they make several exemptions from \ntheir provisions for other employers. For example, they contain exemptions related \nto employees or prospective employees with disabilities, certain instances in which \nage discrimination is permitted, and complete exemptions when the employer and \nemployee are family. See, e.g., M.C.L. ยงยง 37.1202, 37.1206, 37.2202(2)โ(3), 37.2211. \n288.  Instead of allowing the Sacred Heart to hire ministers and \ncoreligionists to run its religious school, the Act forces Sacred Heart to seek \npermission from government officials to operate consistent with the Catholic faith \nand its doctrine through the BFOQ process for every single employee. See Ex. 8, \nBFOQ Form. \n289.  Government officials who do not share or are hostile to the Catholic \nfaith and its doctrine are unlikely to grant Sacred Heart a BFOQ exemption for \nevery position in its school.  \n290.  Regardless, the BFOQ process violates Plaintiffsโ rights and harms \nthem because: \na.  participating in it would validate the incorrect idea that churches must \nseek government approval to hire employees consistent with their faith and \ndoctrine; \n  39 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-01214   ECF No. 1,  PageID.40   Filed 12/22/22   Page 40 of 74\nb.  participating in the BFOQ process invades Sacred Heartโs autonomy \nand conflicts with the First Amendmentโs ministerial and co-religionist \nexceptions; \nc.  seeking a BFOQ exception would alert hostile state officials to the fact \nthat Sacred Heartโs operations conflict with Michiganโs re-understood laws;  \nd.  if Sacred Heart applied for exceptions for each of its employees, the \nCommission may direct the Department to investigate any matter relevant to \nthe application, including by demanding that Sacred Heart produce records, \ndocuments, data, or other information, MDCR Rule 37.25(2); and \ne.  applying for exceptions for every Sacred Heart employee would \nsubstantially burden Sacred Heart because it would have to hire legal \ncounsel to seek an exception every time it has an open position (which is \nfrequently). \n291.  The Act also allows the Department to make individualized \nexemptions, which in the context of Sacred Heart and other religious schools would \nresult in government officials becoming entangled with religious institutionsโ hiring \npractices. M.C.L. ยง 37.2208; see also Fulton v. City of Philadelphia, 141 S. Ct. 1868, \n1879 (2021).  \n292.  Teachers who are not Catholic and/or who do not wish to embrace the \nCatholic faith and its doctrine may teach in any number of public or secular private \nschools that reflect those teachersโ values. \n293.  The BFOQ process also puts Sacred Heart at a competitive \ndisadvantage. The Grand Rapids area has a number of employment alternatives for \nteachers and other staff to work in the educational industry. See \nhttps://grps.tedk12.com/hire/index.aspx#aJobListings.   \n  40 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-01214   ECF No. 1,  PageID.41   Filed 12/22/22   Page 41 of 74\nXI.  The Actโs and penal codeโs public accommodations provisions \nthreaten Sacred Heartโs ability to operate according to its religious beliefs. \n294.  The Act broadly defines public accommodations as an โeducational. . . \nfacility[] or any institution of any kind, whether licensed or not, whose goods, \nservices, facilities, privileges, or accommodations are extended, offered, sold, or \notherwise made available to the public.โ M.C.L. ยง 37.2301(a).  \n295.  The Act also defines public service to include โa tax exempt private \nagency established to provide service to the public.โ M.C.L. ยง 37.2301(b).  \n296.  According to Michigan, Sacred Heart fits within the Actโs definition of \na place of public accommodation and a public-service provider.4 \n297.  The Actโs public accommodations provisions prohibit discrimination in \nplaces of public accommodation and, like the employment provisions, they include a \npublication ban. \n298.  The public accommodations provisions prohibit entities from denying \nan individual โthe full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, \nprivileges, advantages, or accommodations . . . because of religion,โ โsex,โ โmarital \nstatus,โ sexual orientation, or gender identity. M.C.L. ยง 37.2302(a).  \n299.  The provisions prohibit โoutright denial of access toโ a public \naccommodationโs goods, premises, or facilities as well as denial of โequal enjoyment \nof th[ose] goods, services, [or] facilities.โ Clarke v. K Mart Corp., 495 N.W.2d 820, \n822 (Mich. App. 1992). \n \n4 Sacred Heart welcomes any student whose family desires that their child receive a \nCatholic education provided in an authentic Christian environment that strives to \noperate consistent with the Catholic Churchโs faith and doctrine. Sacred Heart \nbelieves that, although it invites all persons to participate in the Christian life of its \nschool, it is not a public accommodation because of its selective enrollment policies, \nwhich ensure commitment to the Churchโs teachings and religious beliefs. See \nVarlesi v. Wayne State Univ., 909 F. Supp. 2d 827, 847 (E.D. Mich. 2012) \n  41 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-01214   ECF No. 1,  PageID.42   Filed 12/22/22   Page 42 of 74\n300.  Public accommodations are also prohibited from maintaining policies \nthat make distinctions because of a protected characteristic. Whitman v. Mercy-\nMemโl Hosp., 339 N.W.2d 730, 732 (Mich. App. 1983). \n301.  The public accommodations provisions force Sacred Heart to violate \nCatholic doctrine on the human person and human sexuality. Sacred Heart refers to \nstudents and staff by their pronouns when they are consistent with biology. But the \npublic accommodations provisions require Sacred Heart use preferred pronouns for \nthose who identify as a gender inconsistent with their biological sex. \n302.  The public accommodations provision also forces Sacred Heart to \nprovide educational services to gender-confused children in a manner that violates \nthe Catholic faith and its doctrine. \n303.  For example, Sacred Heart makes distinctions based on studentsโ \nbiological sex and accordingly provides them separate access to sports teams, \nrestroom facilities, and even student โhouseholdsโ or โhouses.โ  \n304.  The Actโs public accommodations provisions require Sacred Heart to \nallow student access to these facilities and activities based on the studentโs \nperceived gender identity, even if that differs from the studentโs biological sex. But \nSacred Heart cannot allow such access without violating the Catholic faith and its \ndoctrine on human sexuality. \n305.  Sacred Heart makes sex-based distinctions due to the Catholic \nChurchโs doctrine on the complementarity of the sexes, authentic Christian \nmasculinity and femininity, and each personโs identity in Christ as a beloved son or \ndaughter of God. However, under the Actโs public accommodations provisions, \nSacred Heart violates the law by not facilitating student or parent requests that \nchildren be treated inconsistent with their biological sex.  \n306.  The public accommodations provisions also apply to Sacred Heartโs \nemployment decisions. See Haynes v. Neshewat, 729 N.W.2d 488, 490 (Mich. 2007) \n  42 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-01214   ECF No. 1,  PageID.43   Filed 12/22/22   Page 43 of 74\n(once an entity is a public accommodation, it โprohibits unlawful discrimination \nagainst any individual, not just members of the publicโ). \n307.  The public accommodations provisions therefore require Sacred Heart \nto approve employee requests for special treatment that is inconsistent with the \nCatholic faith and its doctrine, like use of preferred pronouns, restroom facilities, \nand other issues. \n308.  Likewise, the publication bans prohibit Sacred Heart from explaining \nthe Catholic doctrine and its policies on religion and on human sexuality. Thatโs \nbecause the Act and the penal code prohibit publishing or printing messages that \nindicate that its services might be denied to individuals due to protected status, see \nM.C.L. ยง 37.2302(b), or that individuals may not be welcome to the public \naccommodationsโ services due to protected status, see M.C.L. ยง 750.147.  \n309.  Practically, the publication bans prohibit Sacred Heart from sharing \nChurch doctrine in its school handbooks, on its website, in its memorandum of \nunderstanding, or elsewhere. See Exs. 1, Student Handbook, 3, Faculty Memo and \nOath, 7, Statement on Catholic Doctrine, 9, Current Job Postings, 11 Faculty \nHandbook. It prohibits Sacred Heart from teaching Catholic beliefs directly to \ncurrent or prospective students or to members of the public.  \n310.  Sacred Heart wants to communicate its commitment to operating \nconsistent with Church teaching in all areas, including human sexuality and \nmarriage, but it cannot do so without violating the Act and penal code and their \npublication bans. \n311.  Sacred Heartโs Pastor wishes to issue a statement on the Churchโs \ndoctrine on marriage and human sexuality and how it relates to sexual orientation \nand gender identity issues and Michigan law.  \n312.  Sacred Heart wishes to publish this statement but cannot do so under \nthe Act and the penal code. \n  43 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-01214   ECF No. 1,  PageID.44   Filed 12/22/22   Page 44 of 74\n313.  A copy of the pastorโs statement is attached as Ex. 7, Statement on \nCatholic Doctrine. \n314.  The Act and penal codeโs publication bans are vague, overbroad, and \ndiscretionary. The publication bans leave Sacred Heart guessing on what speech is \npermissible or illicit under the act, make more speech illicit than necessary to \nachieve Michiganโs anti-discrimination goals, and provide Defendants too much \ndiscretion in determining which speech they will deem illicit. \n315.  Those seeking educational choices that provide alternative viewpoints \non marriage and human sexuality have many options. \n316.  Grand Rapids, Michigan, has a large number of schools (from pre-\nkindergarten to twelfth grade) in the area, including over 40 public schools. See \nAbout Us, Grand Rapids Public Schools, https://grps.org/our-district/about-us/ (last \nvisited Dec. 16, 2022).    \nXII.  Defendants aggressively enforce the Act and penal code against \nalleged discrimination. \n317.  The Commission and the Department investigate, enforce, and \nprosecute alleged violations of the Act.  \n318.  The Department receives complaints alleging violations of the Act from \nโ[a]ny person claiming to be aggrieved by unlawful discrimination.โ MDCR Rule \n37.4(1). \n319.  โPersonโ includes individuals, associations, advocacy organizations, \nlegal or commercial entities, and Michigan, its subdivisions, and its agencies. \nMDCR Rule 37.2(m).  \n320.  The Department may initiate complaints on its own authority. M.C.L. \nยง 37.2602(c). \n321.  The Commission, the Director, or any of their agents may initiate and \nfile a complaint with the Department on their own authority. MDCR Rule 37.4(2).  \n  44 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-01214   ECF No. 1,  PageID.45   Filed 12/22/22   Page 45 of 74\n322.  The Department and the Commission also have the authority to use \nโtestersโ to investigate suspected violations of Michiganโs civil-rights law and have \nin fact used testing evidence to bring enforcement action under some provisions of \nMichiganโs civil-rights law.5 \n323.  Even where a particular complainant lacks a basis for challenging, the \nDepartment and Commission may pursue cases alleging discrimination based on a \npolicy or a โpattern or practice of discrimination.โ M.C.L. ยง 37.2605(1). \n324.  After the Department receives a complaint against an entity that \nallegedly discriminated, the Department investigates the complaint. M.C.L. \nยง 37.2602(c). \n325.  This investigatory process imposes significant burdens on those \naccused of discrimination and it occurs in an adversarial process where the \nDepartment prosecutes the charge. MDCR Rule 37.12(6).  \n326.  If the Commission finds that unlawful discrimination occurred, it can \naward significant remedies including damages for mental distress, humiliation, \nembarrassment, outrage, disappointment, and other forms of mental anguish that \nresult from discrimination based on the complaintโs testimony alone.  \n327.  The Commission has significant discretion in awarding non-economic \ndamages and has awarded significant non-economic damages in the past.  \n328.  The Commission has significant discretion in awarding attorney fees \nand costs and does award significant attorney fees and costs.  \n329.  The Department and the Commission actively receive and prosecute \ncomplaints and charges for alleged violations of the Act.  \n \n5 Mich. C.R. Commโn, 2020 2021 Biannual Report, https://bit.ly/3tkuWiw.  \n  45 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-01214   ECF No. 1,  PageID.46   Filed 12/22/22   Page 46 of 74\n330.  According to the Departmentโs most recent legislative report, in Fiscal \nYear 2021, the Department received 1,033 complaints of discrimination in \nemployment, public accommodations, and education.6  \n331.  Between fiscal years 2011 and 2021, the Department and the \nCommission received, investigated, and processed more than 7,000 complaints \nagainst employers and more than 2,000 complaints against public accommodations.  \n332.  Between fiscal years 2011 and 2021, the Department and the \nCommission also received, investigated, and processed more than 5,000 complaints \nalleging sex discrimination and more than 700 complaints alleging religious \ndiscrimination. \n333.  Between May 2018 and December 2019, the Department and the \nCommission received, investigated, and processed 73 complaints alleging sexual \norientation and gender-identity discrimination.  \n334.  The Department and the Commission did so even though a binding \ncourt opinion held that Michiganโs civil-rights law did not prohibit sexual \norientation discrimination. \n335.  For the fiscal year ending in 2023, the Department and the \nCommission have a $7 million budget to investigate and prosecute complaints. \nExecutive Budget Bill FY 2023โ2024 at 36 (2022), https://bit.ly/3AVzJMe.  \n336.  The Act also permits any person alleging a violation of the law to file a \ncivil action for injunctive relief, damages, and attorney fees and costs in an \nappropriate circuit court. M.C.L. ยง 37.2801(1)โ(2). \nXIII.  Defendantsโ hostile actions further demonstrate a likelihood of \nenforcement \n337.  Michiganโs Attorney General, Defendant Nessel, has taken the position \nthat laws that prohibit discrimination โbecause of sexโ likewise prohibit \n \n6 The report is available at https://bit.ly/3FZHtj3.  \n  46 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-01214   ECF No. 1,  PageID.47   Filed 12/22/22   Page 47 of 74\ndiscrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. See Br. for Ill. et al. \nas Amici Curiae in Support of Employees 3โ4, Bostock v. Clayton County, 2019 WL \n2915040 (Nos. 17-1618, 17-1623, 18-107) (July 3, 2019). \n338.  Defendant Nessel believes that failing to use preferred pronouns is an \nact of gender-identity discrimination, as the policy for her office requires employees \nto use preferred pronouns and contains no religious accommodations or exceptions.7 \n339.  Sacred Heart also fears aggressive government enforcement because \nDefendant Nessel has made public comments hostile to the Catholic faith and \nbecause the schoolโs faith-based approach to education makes it a target for those \nwho disagree with its religious worldview. \n340.  Defendant Nessel has already been faulted by this Court for acting \nwithout neutrality toward religious actors in another case. See Buck v. Gordon, 429 \nF.Supp. 3d 447, 462โ63 (W.D. Mich 2019). \n341.   Defendant Nessel campaigned on the principle that the Catholic \nChurchโs beliefs and practices about marriage constitute โhate,โ and that a \nMichigan law protecting the religious liberty rights of adoption and foster agencies \nis โdiscriminatory animus.โ Id. at 462.  \n342.  After taking office, Defendant Nessel settled a case for the purpose of \nnullifying that duly enacted law while supporting termination of Catholic adoption \nand foster agencies in a manner that the district court found to be a โpretext for \nreligious targeting.โ Id. at 463. \n343.  Defendant Nessel has referred to Catholic adoption agencies as โhate \nmongers,โ smeared Catholics with a snide remark about โtheir rosary,โ and \nmaligned a respected former Michigan Court of Appeals Judge simply because he is \n \n7 Mich.

Ingrid Jacques, Nessel Wages Crusade Against Catholics, The Detroit \nNews (April 15, 2019), https://perma.cc/U6QF-CPBJ. \n344.  Defendants Nessel and the Department โfiled a bypass application in \nthe Michigan Supreme Court, seeking a prompt review of [Rouch World].โ Press \nRelease, AG Nessel, Department of Civ. Rights File to Protect Citizens from Sexual \nOrientation Discrimination Before Michigan Supreme Court (Oct. 25, 2021). \n345.  After the Rouch World decision, Nessel stated that โ[n]ow is the time \n. . . to ensure no person in this state ever experiences barriers to employment, \nhousing, education, or public accommodations and services because of who they are \nor whom they love.โ Press Release, AG Nessel Prevails in ELCRA Case (July 28, \n2022).  \n346.  Because of Defendantsโ history of public hostility to the Catholic faith, \nits beliefs about marriage and human sexuality, and toward Catholic institutions, \nPlaintiffs face enforcement of the Act and penal code. \n347.  Another Christian entity recently filed suit against Defendants, \nalleging that the re-understood Act and penal code violate its First and Fourteenth \nAmendment rights. Defendants did not deny that the Act and penal code apply to \nreligious institutions and did not disclaim enforcing the Act and penal code against \nreligious institutions going forward. \n348.  Some recent polling suggests that nearly 40% of children in โgen Zโ \n(i.e. the generation of students at Sacred Heart) and 30% of Christian students now \nidentify as LGBTQ. See Paul Bond, Nearly 40 Percent of U.S. Gen Zs, 30 Percent of \nYoung Christians Identify as LGBTQ, Poll Shows, Newsweek (October 20, 2021) \nhttps://www.newsweek.com/nearly-40-percent-us-gen-zs-30-percent-christians-\nidentify-lgbtq-poll-shows-1641085.   \n349.  Sacred Heart has had and does have students who experience same \nsex attraction, gender discordance, or gender dysphoria. Sacred Heart has always \n  48 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-01214   ECF No. 1,  PageID.49   Filed 12/22/22   Page 49 of 74\ntreated these students in accordance with its Catholic beliefs and has declined to \naffirm any identity inconsistent with Catholic doctrine. With nearly 400 students \nand dozens of staff members, Sacred Heart, like all schools, faces the likelihood of \nreceiving a student or staff memberโs request for special treatment that violates the \nCatholic faith and its doctrine. To operate consistent with its faith and doctrine, \nSacred Heart would have to refuse such a request and risk complaints and a \nsubsequent investigation by Defendants. For example, a student experiencing \ngender discordance recently left Sacred Heart because that student no longer \nwished to abide by the schoolโs Catholic requirements and formation. \n350.  Defendantsโ broad prosecutorial authority means Sacred Heart faces a \ncredible threat and substantial risk of investigation and enforcement if it applies for \nBFOQ exemptions for every one of its employees. \n351.  Sacred Heart requires every single employee to sign the memorandum \nof understanding and swear the oath of fidelity, which require every employee to \nlive out the Catholic faith in every aspect of life. So that means Sacred Heart would \nhave to apply for a BFOQ exemption for every current employee and every single \ntime it wanted to hire any employee. \n352.  Sacred Heart has refrained from going through the BFOQ exception \nprocess due to fear of Defendantsโ prosecution, because the process is burdensome \non Sacred Heart and an invasion of its autonomy, because the requirement to apply \nfor government permission to hire ministers and coreligionists violates Sacred \nHeartโs rights, and because the creation of a formal mechanism for granting \nexceptions renders this policy and process not generally applicable. \n353.  The Actโs BFOQ process does not provide Sacred Heart with sufficient \nprotection against allegations of employment discrimination because (a) any \ncomplaint of a violation of the Act by an employee or applicant would terminate any \nrequest that Sacred Heart made for a BFOQ exemption. MDCR Rule 37.25(2); (b) \n  49 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-01214   ECF No. 1,  PageID.50   Filed 12/22/22   Page 50 of 74\nthe commission may revoke any BFOQ exemption. MDCR Rule 37.25(3); (c) BFOQ \nexemptions are interpreted narrowly; and (d) going through the BFOQ process \nexposes Sacred Heart to liability because Michigan can initiate complaints against \nBFOQ applicants. MCL ยง 37.2602(c); MDCR Rule 37.4. \n354.  Plaintiffs are not aware of any jurisdiction granting a BFOQ exception \nbased on religious beliefs about sexual orientation, marital status, or gender \nidentity. And Michigan has no record of any BFOQ applications or granted \nexemptions. See Ex. 12, BFOQ FOIA. \n355.  The very fact that Title VII contains a specific co-religionist exception \nin addition to the BFOQ exception indicates that the BFOQ exception is not \nsufficient to allow Sacred Heart to hire people who share its faith. \n356.  Sacred Heartโs operations violate the Act and penal code in Michiganโs \nview. Based on the investigative and prosecutorial authority granted to Defendants \nalong with their prior actions, Sacred Heart faces imminent investigation, \nenforcement, and punishment by Defendants. \nLegal Allegations \n357.  Sacred Heart is subject to and must comply with Act and the penal \ncode. \n358.  The Actโs education, employment, and public accommodations \nprovisions and its publication bans violate Plaintiffsโ constitutional rights, and chill \nand deter Sacred Heart from exercising its constitutional rights. \n359.  The penal codeโs employment and public accommodations provisions \nand its publication ban violate Plaintiffsโ constitutional rights, and chill and deter \nSacred Heart from exercising its constitutional rights. \n  50 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-01214   ECF No. 1,  PageID.51   Filed 12/22/22   Page 51 of 74\n360.  As a direct and proximate result of Defendantsโ violations of Plaintiffsโ \nconstitutional rights, Plaintiffs have suffered and will suffer ongoing irreparable \nharm, entitling them to declaratory and injunctive relief. \n361.  Plaintiffs do not have an adequate monetary or legal remedy for the \nloss of its constitutional rights. \n362.  Unless Defendants are enjoined, Plaintiffs will continue to suffer \nirreparable harm. \nFirst Cause of Action \nViolation of the First Amendmentโs Free Exercise and Establishment \nClauses: Religious Autonomy, Ministerial Exception, Co-Religionists, and \nCompelled Participation \n363.  Sacred Heart repeats and realleges all preceding allegations.  \n364.  Sacred Heart exercises its religion by living as an intentional Christian \ncommunity where each employee is an authority figure responsible for modeling \nand teaching the Catholic faith and its doctrine to students and each other. Every \nSacred Heart employee is responsible for modeling the Catholic faith to students \nand they serve as โcatechists,โ i.e. ministers certified to teach the Catholic faith and \nits doctrine to Sacred Heartโs students. \n365.  The First Amendmentโs Free Exercise and Establishment Clauses \nprotect Sacred Heartโs right to 1) form an intentional Catholic community, 2) select \nits leaders and ministers, 3) decide for itself matters of faith and doctrine, 4) \nmanage its internal affairs related to employment and the services it provides, 5) to \ndecide how to effectively communicate its religious beliefs, 6) operate itself as a \nCatholic apostolate, 7) associate with and employ employees and staff in accordance \nwith Catholic teaching, and 8) be free from participating in activities and \nprocedures that violate its religious beliefs.  \n  51 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-01214   ECF No. 1,  PageID.52   Filed 12/22/22   Page 52 of 74\n366.   The First Amendmentโs religion clauses protect churchesโ autonomy \nby restricting the stateโs power to regulate matters of faith, doctrine, and church \ngovernment; this is known as the โChurch Autonomy Doctrine.โ \n367.  The application of the challenged Act and penal code provisions burden \nSacred Heartโs religious exercise and violate Sacred Heartโs religious autonomy \nrights by forcing it to govern its school in manner inconsistent with the Catholic \nfaith and its doctrine.  \n368.  Application of the Act violates Sacred Heartโs Free Exercise rights \nspecifically by: \na.  Prohibiting Sacred Heart from or penalizing it for favoring Catholic job \nand student applicants over those who do not share or support the \ncommunityโs faith. \nb.  Forcing Sacred Heart to employ those who do not or cannot support, \nmodel, and communicate the Catholic faith and its doctrine, including in key \nleadership positions. \nc.  Forcing Sacred Heart to abandon or penalizing it for maintaining \nemployee conduct requirements consistent with the Catholic faith and its \ndoctrine. \nd.  Preventing Sacred Heart from only hiring or admitting co-religionists. \ne.  Forcing Sacred Heart to admit and retain students who do not support \nor desire to be formed according to its Catholic faith and doctrine. \nf.  Forcing Sacred Heart to admit and retain students whose conduct is \ninconsistent with the Catholic faith and its doctrine. \ng.  Forcing Sacred Heart to abandon student conduct standards based on \nCatholic doctrine on the nature of the human person, human sexuality, and \nmarriage. \n  52 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-01214   ECF No. 1,  PageID.53   Filed 12/22/22   Page 53 of 74\nh.  Forcing Sacred Heart to honor student or staff requests for special \ntreatment based on transgender or other sexual ideologies that are \ninconsistent with the Catholic faith and its doctrine. \ni.  Forcing Sacred Heart to refrain from teaching Catholic doctrine on the \nnature of the human person, human sexuality, and marriage. \nj.  Prohibiting Sacred Heart from making sex-based distinctions in its \noperations based on Catholic doctrine on the nature of the human person, \nhuman sexuality, and marriage. \nk.  Prohibiting Sacred Heart from or penalizing it for communicating \nCatholic doctrine on the nature of the human person, human sexuality, and \nmarriage in the classroom, or to employees, applicants, families, and the \npublic. \nl.  Prohibiting Sacred Heart from or penalizing it for requiring all \nemployees to sign a โmemorandum of understandingโ where they affirm their \ncommitment to live and modelโand their responsibility to teachโthe \nCatholic faith and its doctrine, including on marriage and human sexuality. \nm.  Prohibiting Sacred Heart from or penalizing it for requiring all \nemployees to swear an โoath of fidelityโ to the Catholic Church, its teachings \nand doctrine. \nn.  Requiring Sacred Heart to ask state officials for โbona fide \noccupational qualificationโ exemptions for all current employees and when \nhiring employees in the future, when the state has no authority to regulate \nits hiring, discipline, and retention of ministers and co-religionists. \n369.   Sacred Heart is a Catholic Christian school that exists to bring the \nliving Christ into the world through intentional community, to model the Catholic \nlife, and to support parents in the religious formation and education of their \nchildren. \n  53 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-01214   ECF No. 1,  PageID.54   Filed 12/22/22   Page 54 of 74\n370.  The First Amendmentโs religion clauses protect churchesโ autonomy by \nallowing them sole authority to choose individuals who play important ministerial \nroles. This is known as the โMinisterial Exception,โ and it limits the stateโs \nregulatory power. \n371.  As applied to Sacred Heart, the Actโs employment and public \naccommodations provisions violate the Ministerial Exception because they prohibit \nSacred Heart from employing or retaining only those individuals who support, \nmodel, and can communicate the Catholic faith and its doctrine to students. \n372.  The Act violates the First Amendment by requiring Sacred Heart to \nask state officials for โbona fide occupational qualificationโ exemptions for all \ncurrent employees and when hiring future employees, when the state has no \nauthority to regulate Sacred Heartโs hiring, discipline, and retention of ministers \nand co-religionists. \n373.  Indeed, Sacred Heart has a constitutional right to employ only \ncoreligionistsโindividuals who all share the same understanding of and \ncommitment to the Catholic faith. \n374.  Defendants have no compelling interest in enforcing the challenged Act \nand penal code provisions against Sacred Heart and its intentionally Catholic \nChristian community. \n375.  Defendants are not pursuing any legitimate government interests in \nthe means least restrictive to Sacred Heartโs religious exercise. \n376.  As applied to Sacred Heart, the challenged Act and penal code \nprovisions violate the Free Exercise Clause because they put Sacred Heart to a \nchoice between operating its school consistent with the Catholic faith and its \ndoctrine or closing its school to comply with the law. \n377.  Without relief from the Act and penal codeโs enforcement, Sacred \nHeart will have to cease providing education services as an exercise of its faith.  \n  54 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-01214   ECF No. 1,  PageID.55   Filed 12/22/22   Page 55 of 74\n378.  Defendants do not serve any compelling or even valid interest in a \nnarrowly tailored way by infringing Plaintiffsโ rights to freely exercise Plaintiffโs \nreligion. \n379.  Accordingly, as applied to Sacred Heart, the challenged Act and penal \ncode provisions violates the First Amendmentโs protections to freely exercise \nreligion. \nSecond Cause of Action \nViolation of the First Amendmentโs Free Exercise Clause: Lack of General \nApplicability, Individualized Exemptions, Hostility, and Compelled \nParticipation \n380.  Plaintiffs repeat and reallege all preceding allegations up to and \nincluding Paragraph 362. \n381.  The First Amendmentโs Free Exercise Clause protects Plaintiffsโ rights \nto be free from having special disabilities imposed on the basis of stating disfavored \nreligious views, being subject to individualized assessments, being subject to laws \nthat lack neutrality and general application, being targeted for their religious \nbeliefs, and being punished for exercising their religious beliefs. \n382.  Sacred Heart exercises its religion by forming students as Catholics \nand by cultivating Catholic culture to serve as a witness of and to make present the \nliving Christ to the Grand Rapids community. \n383.  Sacred Heart exercises its religion by operating its school and adopting \npolicies consistent with the Catholic faith and its doctrine in all aspects. \n384.  Sacred Heart exercises its religion by making sex-based distinctions \nbetween male and female students that reflect and model Catholic doctrine on \nhuman sexuality. These distinctions include, among other things, separating \nstudents by sex for community and fellowship purposes, separating males and \nfemales in competitive athletics to teach students virtues and authentic femininity \nand masculinity, by having distinct uniforms and restroom facilities for males and \n  55 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-01214   ECF No. 1,  PageID.56   Filed 12/22/22   Page 56 of 74\nfemales, and by providing instruction to students on human sexuality, including the \ndistinctness of the sexes and its theological implications. \n385.  Sacred Heart exercises its religion by recruiting, hiring, and retaining \nemployees who follow Catholic doctrine in all aspects of their life and by requiring \nits employees to sign a memorandum of understanding and swear an oath of fidelity \neach year agreeing to abide by Church doctrine. \n386.  Sacred Heart exercises its religion by honestly communicating Catholic \ndoctrine to employees, students, families, and the public. \n387.  Without injunctive relief against Defendants, Sacred Heart is \nrefraining from and will have to refrain from engaging in certain religious exercise \nbecause of the challenged Act and penal code provisions. \n388.  For example, simply maintaining a policy of only hiring employees who \nbelieve and model the Catholic faith, and of requiring employees to affirm the \nmemorandum of understanding and swear an oath of fidelity to Catholic doctrine \nevery year, constitutesโin Michiganโs viewโa pattern or practice of discrimination \nin violation of the Act. \n389.  Likewise, simply making sex-based distinctions, in policy and practice, \nbetween male and female students, in line with Catholic doctrine, and only \nreferring to students by sex-based pronouns, constitutesโin Michiganโs viewโa \npattern or practice of discrimination in violation of the Act. \n390.  As applied to Sacred Heart, the Actโs and penal codeโs employment, \neducation, and public accommodations provisions, and publication bans \nsubstantially burden Sacred Heartโs sincerely held religious beliefs by requiring it \neither to refrain from adopting and maintaining policies and practices consistent \nwith its Catholic beliefs, ignore those beliefs, or close its school. \n  56 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-01214   ECF No. 1,  PageID.57   Filed 12/22/22   Page 57 of 74\n391.  And Sacred Heart is currently refraining from communicating the \nCatholic faith and its doctrine because doing so would violate the Act and penal \ncode as they are now understood. \n392.  As applied to Sacred Heart, the Actโs and penal codeโs employment, \neducation, and public accommodations provisions, and publication bans \nsubstantially burden Sacred Heartโs sincerely held religious beliefs by a) stopping it \nfrom honestly communicating the Catholic faith and its conduct expectations with \nprospective employees, families, students, and the public; b) barring it from \ninquiring or informing prospective employees, students, and families about its \nreligious beliefs, and c) by preventing its religiously motivated speech in teaching \nthe Catholic faith to its students. \n393.  The Actโs and penal codeโs employment, education, and public \naccommodations provisions are not neutral or generally applicable because they \ncontain a system of exceptions, including individualized exemptions that authorize \nMichigan to make individualized assessments of employment positions and exempt \nsome positions for BFOQs based on Defendantsโ sole discretion. \n394.  The Act gives Defendants discretion to grant exemptions from its \nrequirements and categorically exempts some organizations and individuals from \nthe Actโs requirements for secular but not religious reasons.  \n395.  The Actโs and penal codeโs employment, education, and public \naccommodations provisions and publication bans do not force nonreligious persons \nand schools, or persons and schools with favored religious views, to choose between \nviolating their convictions and operating their organizations. \n396.  And Defendants have already targeted other Catholic institutions for \nexercising their religion. \n397.  The Act and penal code are not facially or operationally neutral or \ngenerally applicable, are hostile towards religion, target and show favoritism \n  57 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-01214   ECF No. 1,  PageID.58   Filed 12/22/22   Page 58 of 74\ntowards certain religious beliefs, and impose special disabilities on Sacred Heart \ndue to its religious beliefs.  \n398.  The Act, penal code, and Defendantsโ overt hostility toward the \nCatholic faith impose severe coercive pressure on Sacred Heart to change or violate \nits religious beliefs, stop communicating its beliefs, and to stop operating according \nto the Catholic faith.  \n399.  Without relief from the Act and penal codeโs enforcement, Sacred \nHeart will have to cease providing education services as an exercise of its faith. \n400.  As applied to Sacred Heart, the challenged Act and penal code \nprovisions violate the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States \nConstitution by conditioning the privileges or immunities of citizenship on Sacred \nHeartโs abandoning its commitment to Catholic doctrine and religious exercise. \n401.  Sacred Heartโs right to operate its religious school consistent with the \nCatholic faith and its doctrine is deeply rooted in this Nationโs history and tradition \nand is implicit in the concept of ordered liberty.  \n402.  As applied to Sacred Heart, the Act and penal code and their \npublication bans violate Sacred Heartโs hybrid Free Exercise and Free Speech \nrights by outlawing its religious speech about Catholic doctrine on marriage and \nhuman sexuality. \n403.  Defendants do not serve any compelling or even valid interest in a \nnarrowly tailored way by infringing the rights to freely exercise Plaintiffโs religion. \n404.  Accordingly, as applied to Sacred Heart, the Act and penal code violate \nthe First Amendmentโs protections to freely exercise religion. \nThird Cause of Action \nViolation of the First Amendmentโs Free Speech and Assembly Clauses: \nFreedom of Speech, Expressive Association, and Assembly \n  58 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-01214   ECF No. 1,  PageID.59   Filed 12/22/22   Page 59 of 74\n405.  Plaintiffs repeat and reallege all preceding allegations up to and \nincluding Paragraph 362. \n406.  The First Amendmentโs Free Speech, and Assembly Clauses protect \nSacred Heartโs ability to speak; to create, publish, and distribute speech; to \nassociate with others for expressive purposes; to only associate with Sacred Heartโs \ndesired messages; and to peaceably assemble to engage in otherwise lawful religious \nworship, exercise, and speech activities with persons of its choosing. \n407.  The First Amendment also protects Plaintiffsโ ability not to speak; to \nexercise control over their speech; to decline to associate with others for expressive \npurposes; and to decline to assemble with others. \n408.  The First Amendment further protects Plaintiffsโ right to be free from \ncontent, viewpoint, and speaker-based discrimination, overbroad restrictions on \nspeech, and vague laws allowing unbridled discretion by enforcement officials. \n409.  The Catholic Church is a community of persons called by God into \nassembly to make the living Christ present in the world today, and to provide \nonlookers with a glimpse of a society comprised of persons living as disciples of \nJesus Christ. Sacred Heart is a local intentional Catholic community responding to \nGodโs call to assemble. Sacred Heart exists to communicate the Gospel message of \nChrist to its community and does so through its expression and expressive \nassembly.  \n410.  Sacred Heart engages in expression, expressive activities, and \nprotected assembly as an organization when its employees and students gather \ntogether and pursue the Churchโs mission through the schoolโs activities, including \nby expressing and modeling the Catholic faith and its doctrine. \n411.  Sacred Heart also engages in expression, expressive activities, and \nprotected assembly as an organization when its employees gather together, provide \nCatholic education to students, and communicate with the public because Sacred \n  59 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-01214   ECF No. 1,  PageID.60   Filed 12/22/22   Page 60 of 74\nHeart believes that these activities and this organization are a witness of the \nCatholic faith and an expression of its cultivation of Catholic culture. \n412.  Sacred Heart engages in expression, expressive activities, and \nprotected assembly by gathering to transmit the Catholic faith to students, their \nfamilies, and the community. \n413.  Sacred Heartโs classroom instruction, website, handbooks, employment \nmemorandum of understanding, curricula, and other documents communicate with \nits students, employees, families, and the public about the Catholic faith and its \ndoctrine. These are forms of protected speech and expression. \n414.  The Actโs publication ban prohibits any public accommodation or \npublic service from publishing a โstatement, advertisement, notice, or signโ to the \neffect thatโ a personโs โpatronage of or presence atโ the public accommodation or \npublic service is โobjectionable, unwelcome, unacceptable, or undesirableโ because \nof the personโs religion, sex, marital status, sexual orientation, or gender identity. \nM.C.L. ยง 37.2302(b). The penal code similarly prohibits publishing any statement \nindicating that someone is โnot welcome, objectionable, or not acceptable, not \ndesired or solicitedโ because of religion. M.C.L. ยง 750.147. \n415.  Sacred Heart cannot legally communicate its commitment to the \nCatholic faith and its doctrine on marriage and human sexuality because that \ndoctrine is incompatible with transgender ideology and other LGBTQ ideologies. \n416.  The Act and penal code and their publication bans violate Sacred \nHeartโs free speech rights by making it illegal for Sacred Heart to communicate its \nCatholic faith and doctrine. Sacred Heartโs protected free speech activities currently \nviolate the Act and penal code and their publication bans.  \n417.  The Catholic faith and its doctrine on marriage and human sexuality is \nincompatible with same-sex marriage and gender identities differing from biological \nsex. Therefore, Sacred Heart cannot communicate the Catholic faith or its doctrine \n  60 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-01214   ECF No. 1,  PageID.61   Filed 12/22/22   Page 61 of 74\non these subjects without violating the challenged provisions of the Act and penal \ncode, including their publication bans. That includes classroom instruction, \nstatements to its community and the public, and in internal and external \ndocuments. See Exs. 1, Student Handbook, 3, Faculty Memo and Oath, 7, Statement \non Catholic Doctrine, 9, Current Job Postings, 10 Theology of the Body. \n418.  Simply maintaining a written policy of only hiring employees who \nsupport, follow, and model the Catholic faith and its doctrine and requiring \nemployees to affirm the memorandum of understanding and swear an oath of \nfidelity each year, constitutesโin Michiganโs viewโa pattern or practice of \ndiscrimination in violation of the Act and penal code. \n419.  Simply maintaining a written policy of not granting student or \nemployee requests based on transgender or other sexual ideologies inconsistent \nwith Catholic teaching constitutesโin Michiganโs viewโa pattern or practice of \ndiscrimination in violation of the Act and penal code. \n420.  As applied to Sacred Heart, the challenged Act and penal code \nprovisions violate Sacred Heartโs Free Speech, assembly, and expressive association \nrights because they:  \na.  prohibit Sacred Heart from engaging in its desired expressive \nassociation and assembly;  \nb.  compel Sacred Heart to engage in expressive associations and \nassembly it finds objectionable;  \nc.  compel Sacred Heart to speak messages that violate its Catholic faith \nby using pronouns that are inconsistent with a personโs biological sex; \nd.  inhibit Sacred Heart from forming expressive associations and \nassemblies it desires to form and from avoiding expressive associations and \nassemblies it wants to avoid; \n  61 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-01214   ECF No. 1,  PageID.62   Filed 12/22/22   Page 62 of 74\ne.  prohibit Sacred Heart from adopting and maintaining its desired \nemployment policies; \nf.  prohibit Sacred Heart from advertising and posting its employment \nopportunities; \ng.  prohibit Sacred Heart from publishing statements on Catholic doctrine \non marriage and sexuality (see Ex. 7, Statement on Catholic Doctrine); \nh.  prohibit Sacred Heart from adopting and maintaining its desired \nstudent admission, retention, and discipline policies; and  \ni.  regulate expression, association, and assembly based on content, \nviewpoint, and speaker identity.  \n421.  As applied to Sacred Heart, the public accommodations provision \ncompels speech about marriage and human sexuality that Sacred Heart objects to, \nforbids it from forming an intentional Catholic community, and prohibits it from \nadopting policies consistent with the Catholic faith and its doctrine.  \n422.  The challenged provisions of the Act and penal code regulate speech \nbased on content, viewpoint, and speaker identity by making it illicit to \ncommunicate the Catholic faith and its doctrine on marriage and human sexuality \nbut allowing speech on other topics or even opposite viewpoints on marriage and \nsexuality. \n423.  As applied to Sacred Heart, the Act and penal codeโs publication bans \nforce it to refrain from communicating its continued commitment to operate \nconsistent with the Catholic faith and its doctrine despite Michiganโs change in law.  \n424.  As applied to Sacred Heart, the Act conditions its ability to provide \neducational services on the requirement that Sacred Heart abandon its religious \nbeliefs when it provides educational services and as it makes employment decisions. \n425.  As applied to Sacred Heart, the Act contains content, viewpoint, and \nspeaker-based regulations that ban, chill, and burden Sacred Heartโs desired speech \n  62 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-01214   ECF No. 1,  PageID.63   Filed 12/22/22   Page 63 of 74\n(and publication of that speech) on its website, in its internal and external \ndocuments, and directly to prospective and existing employees, students, families, \nand the public. \n426.  As applied to Sacred Heart, the Act and penal codeโs publication bans \nare vague, overbroad, and allow Defendants unbridled discretion to evaluate speech \nand then discriminate based on content and viewpoint in determining whether to \napply the Act and penal code. \n427.  The Act and penal codeโs publication bans are also facially \nunconstitutional because they are vague, overbroad, allow unbridled discretion, and \nare a content-based and viewpoint-based regulation that bans, chills, and burdens \nspeech and publication of speech. \n428.  Sacred Heart cannot not engage in certain protected speech, expressive \nassociation, and assembly without violating the Act and penal code. \n429.  Sacred Heart is self-chilling its desired speech on Church doctrine \nabout marriage and human sexuality because of the Act and the penal code and \ntheir publication bans. See Ex. 7, Statement on Catholic Doctrine. \n430.  Defendants have no valid interest in silencing Sacred Heartโs religious \nspeech about the Catholic faith and its doctrine on marriage and human sexuality.  \n431.  Defendants do not pursue a valid interest in a narrowly tailored way \nby infringing on Sacred Heartโs free-speech, free-association, and free-assembly \nrights. \n432.  Accordingly, as applied to Sacred Heart, the Act and penal code violate \nthe First Amendmentโs protections for free speech, free association, and free \nassembly. \n433.  Accordingly, Michiganโs publication bans facially violate the First \nAmendmentโs protections for free speech. \n  63 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-01214   ECF No. 1,  PageID.64   Filed 12/22/22   Page 64 of 74\nFourth Cause of Action \nViolation of Parentsโ Fourteenth Amendment fundamental right to direct \ntheir childrenโs education. \n434.  Plaintiffs repeat and reallege all preceding allegations up to an \nincluding Paragraph 362. \n435.  The Fourteenth Amendment provides that no State shall โdeprive any \nperson of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.โ U.S. Const. amend. \nXIV. \n436.  The Supreme Court has recognized that the Fourteenth Amendment \nprotects parentsโ fundamental interest in the โcare, custody, and control of their \nchildren.โ Troxel v. Granville, 530 U.S. 57, 65 (2000) (plurality op.). \n437.  Indeed, this right is โperhaps the oldest of the fundamental liberty \ninterests recognized by [the United States Supreme] Court.โ Id. \n438.  In fact, โThe history and culture of Western civilization reflect a strong \ntradition of parental concern for the nurture and upbringing of their children. This \nprimary role of the parents in the upbringing of their children is now established \nbeyond debate as an enduring American tradition.โ Wisconsin v. Yoder, 406 U.S. \n205, 232 (1972). \n439.  This fundamental right โwithout doubtโ includes parentsโ right to \nโestablish a home and bring up childrenโ and โto control the education of their own.โ \nMeyer v. Nebraska, 262 U.S. 390, 399, 401 (1923); accord Pierce v. Socโy of Sisters of \nHoly Names of Jesus & Mary, 268 U.S. 510, 534โ35 (1925). \n440.  โAnd, when the interests of parenthood are combined with a free \nexercise claim . . . more than merely a reasonable relation to some purpose within \nthe competency of the State is required to sustain the validity of the State's \nrequirement under the First Amendment.โ Yoder, 406 U.S. at 233 (internal \nquotations and citation omitted). \n  64 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-01214   ECF No. 1,  PageID.65   Filed 12/22/22   Page 65 of 74\n441.  Parent Plaintiffs have exercised their fundamental right parental \nrights to direct their childrenโs education by choosing to send their children to \nSacred Heart. \n442.  Parent Plaintiffs chose to send their children to Sacred Heart so that \ntheir children will be educated in the Catholic faith. \n443.  Parent Plaintiffs exercised their religious beliefs to raise their children \nin the faith by sending their children to Sacred Heart. \n444.  The Act forbids Sacred Heart from operating in accordance with its \nCatholic beliefs. \n445.  The Act directly and substantially interferes and threatens to interfere \nwith Parent Plaintiffsโ fundamental rights. \n446.  First, it directly and substantially interferes with Parent Plaintiffsโ \nfundamental parental right and responsibility to control the education of their \nchildren. \n447.  Parent Plaintiffs specifically opted out of the public school system and \nhave chosen to send their children to a Catholic school that will allow their children \nto grow academically and spiritually in the Catholic faith. See C.C.C. ยถ 2229 (โAs \nthose first responsible for the education of their children, parents have the right to \nchoose a school for them which corresponds to their own convictions. This right is \nfundamental.โ). \n448.  Because Michiganโs law forbids Sacred Heart from operating consistent \nwith its Catholic beliefs, Parent Plaintiffs have been deprived of their fundamental \nright to send their children to a Catholic school. See Pierce, 268 U.S. at 534โ35 \n(recognizing the right of parents to send their children to Catholic school rather \nthan public school). \n  65 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-01214   ECF No. 1,  PageID.66   Filed 12/22/22   Page 66 of 74\n449.  Second, the Act directly and substantially interferes with Parent \nPlaintiffsโ fundamental parental right and responsibility to raise their children in \ntheir religious faith. \n450.  By sending their children to Sacred Heart, Parent Plaintiffs exercised \ntheir religious beliefs and religious obligation to raise their children in the Catholic \nfaith. See C.C.C. ยถ 2225 (โThrough the grace of the sacrament of marriage, parents \nreceive the responsibility and privilege of evangelizing their children.โ). \n451.  But because Sacred Heart cannot operate its school in accordance with \nits Catholic beliefs, Parent Plaintiffs are deprived of their right to raise children in \nthe Catholic faith. See Yoder, 406 U.S. at 233 (recognizing the right of parents to \nraise their children in the faith by controlling their education). \n452.  Defendants do not serve any compelling or even valid interest in a \nnarrowly tailored way by infringing on Parent Plaintiffsโ fundamental parental \nrights. \n453.  Accordingly, the Act violates Parent Plaintiffsโ fundamental parental \nrights under the Fourteenth Amendment as applied. \n454.  The Act has caused, is continuing to cause, and will likely cause \nirreparable injury to Parent Plaintiffs by depriving them of their fundamental right \nto direct their childrenโs upbringing and education. \nFifth Cause of Action \nViolation of Parentsโ First Amendment right to free exercise of religion. \n455.  Plaintiffs repeat and reallege all preceding allegations up to and \nincluding Paragraph 362. \n456.  The First Amendmentโs Free Exercise Clause protects Parent \nPlaintiffsโ rights to exercise their Catholic faith. \n457.  It also protects Parent Plaintiffsโ rights to raise their children in \naccordance with their Catholic faith. See, e.g., Espinoza v. Mont. Depโt of Revenue, \n  66 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-01214   ECF No. 1,  PageID.67   Filed 12/22/22   Page 67 of 74\n140 S. Ct. 2246, 2261 (2020); Empl. Div., Dept. of Human Res. of Or. v. Smith, 494 \nU.S. 872, 881โ82 (1990); Yoder, 406 U.S. at 213โ14; Pierce, 268 U.S. at 534โ35. \n458.  As explained above, Parent Plaintiffs are practicing Catholics who \nbelieve all of the teachings of the Catholic Church and are raising their children in \nthe Catholic faith. \n459.  They have exercised their religious faith by opting out of public school \nand sending their children to Sacred Heart so that their children will receive \nacademic, moral, and spiritual formation in the Catholic faith.  \n460.  The Act violates Parent Plaintiffsโ free exercise rights by depriving \ntheir children of an authentic Catholic education at Sacred Heart when it prevents \nSacred Heart from operating according to its Catholic beliefs.  \n461.  The Act also violates Parent Plaintiffsโ free exercise rights under the \nhybrid rights doctrine, because it implicates their free exercise rights in conjunction \nwith their fundamental right to direct the upbringing, education, and care of their \nchildren, as alleged in the Fifth Cause of Action. See Smith, 494 U.S. at 881โ82; \nYoder, 406 U.S. at 233. \n462.  Michigan has no legitimateโmuch less compellingโgovernmental \ninterest in usurping Parent Plaintiffsโ rights to exercise their Catholic faith by \nraising their children in the faith. \n463.  Nor are Michiganโs actions narrowly tailored to serve any compelling \ngovernmental interest. \n464.  Application of the Act violates Parent Plaintiffsโ right to the free \nexercise of religion. See U.S. Const. amend. I. \n465.  Application of the Act has caused, is continuing to cause, and will \nlikely cause irreparable injury to Parent Plaintiffs by depriving them of their \nconstitutional right to the free exercise of religion. \n  67 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-01214   ECF No. 1,  PageID.68   Filed 12/22/22   Page 68 of 74\nPrayer for Relief \nPlaintiffs respectfully ask this Court to enter judgment against Defendants \nand provide the following relief:  \n1.
