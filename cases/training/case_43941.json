Defendants' request that their deadline to respond to the complaint be delayed until after Plaintiffs file a notice of constitutional challenge as set forth in Fed. R. Civ. P. 5.1 is denied. Rule 5.1 requires the filing of notice with a state attorney general only when the constitutionality of a state (or federal) statute is drawn into question. Plaintiffs have clarified in their response (Dkt. No. 16) that their complaint does not contest the constitutionality of Mass. Gen. Laws c. 76, s. 5 and such challenge is waived. Plaintiffs reference to the statute is not sufficient to put its constitutionality in doubt. (Zamorski, Michael) (Entered: 05/10/2022)"

    "summary": "<p>This case involved four parents who believed local public school officials overreached when they chose not to disclose their children&rsquo;s decision to establish a new gender identity at school. On April 12, 2022, two sets of parents filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts. The parents sued the school district and various officials, administrators, and teachers in their official capacity under 42 U.S.C. 1983. Represented by public interest attorneys for the Massachusetts Family Institute and Child and Parental Rights Campaign, the parents sought various declarations regarding the policy at issue to be unconstitutional, an injunction against adherence to the policy, nominal damages, compensatory damages, and attorneys&rsquo; fees.</p>\r\n<p>Plaintiffs claimed that a school district may not empower individual teachers to assist students who are in the midst of a crisis of gender identity to transition and in particular to conceal in any manner the student's desire to transition or feelings on the matter from the parents either deliberately or accidentally. In 2012, the Massachusetts Board of Elementary and Secondary Education published guidance for school districts when faced with the instant issue. While the guidance has never been adopted as legally binding or as such to have substantive effect, the plaintiffs rely on the Board&rsquo;s suggestion for how individual school districts should handle informing parents of their children&rsquo;s gender identity crisis. The plaintiffs argued that in the absence of a local school district policy to the contrary, the Board&rsquo;s guidance should govern.</p>\r\n<p>On July 29, 2022, Defendants filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim. Defendants argued that plaintiffs lacked Article III standing because they failed to allege that their children were transgender or had interacted with any of the defendants, failing both the cause or controversy requirement, traceability, and claim upon which relief could be granted requirements of standing. Defendants also asserted qualified immunity.</p>\r\n<p>District Judge Mark Mastroianni granted Defendant&rsquo;s motion to dismiss for lack of standing on December 14, 2022, and noted that in the alternative the allegations in the complaint would not have overcome the school district&rsquo;s qualified immunity. 2022 WL 18356421. On January 11, 2023, Plaintiffs appealed the dismissal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On February 18, 2025, the appellate court upheld the dismissal, concluding that the plaintiffs failed to present a plausible claim that the school's protocol infringed upon their fundamental right under the due process clause &ldquo;to direct the upbringing of their child.&rdquo; 128 F.4th 336. The court also noted that the &ldquo;shock-in-conscience&rdquo; test was not the appropriate legal standard to utilize because the school policy was not executive but legislative conduct. The court based this conclusion on the fact that the policy applies broadly to all students and is administered by multiple government actors. Thus, the test they used was whether the plaintiffs had adequately alleged that Ludlow&rsquo;s conduct restricted a fundamental right, which the court concluded it had not.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>As of February 19, 2025, the case is ongoing.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

Courts nationwide have faced all manner of \nimportant  litigation  involving  matters  of  gender  identity  and \ngender  expression,  including  use  of  folks'  preferred  pronouns.  \nToday's case falls under that broad header.  More specifically, it \npresents for our review challenging issues arising from the Ludlow \nSchool Committee's protocol (\"the Protocol\") requiring its staff \nto use a student's requested name and gender pronouns within the \nschool without notifying the parents of those requests unless that \nstudent consents.  Our appellants are the parents (\"the Parents\") \nof a Ludlow student who chose -- at school but not at home -- to \ngo by a different name and to use different pronouns than those \ngiven to them at birth.1  The Parents assert that Ludlow's practice \nof accommodating and concealing their child's requested name and \npronouns while at school interferes with their parental rights as \nguaranteed by the United States Constitution.2  Ludlow counters \nthat its Protocol is appropriate and necessary to ensure a safe \nand inclusive school learning environment for students. \nIn  this  litigation,  the  competing  concerns  of  the \nParents and Ludlow raise heretofore unanswered questions about the \n \n1  Our  opinion  uses  gender-neutral  \"they/them\"  pronouns  to \nrefer to the Student. \n2 The defendants include the Ludlow School Committee, the \nLudlow Superintendent, various Ludlow educators, as well as the \nTown  of  Ludlow.    For  clarity,  we  refer  to  the  defendants \ncollectively, where appropriate, as \"Ludlow.\" \n- 4 - \n\nCase: 23-1069     Document: 00118249041     Page: 5      Date Filed: 02/18/2025      Entry ID: 6700937\n     \nscope of parental rights protected by the Due Process Clause of \nthe Fourteenth Amendment.  But when all is said and done, we, like \nthe district court, conclude that the Parents have failed to state \na plausible claim that Ludlow's implementation of the Protocol as \napplied to their family violated their fundamental right to direct \nthe upbringing of their child. \nI.  BACKGROUND \nAs usual, our appellate work begins with an overview of \nthe facts that give rise to the issues now before us.  As we jut \nthrough  that  procedural  landscape,  our  recitation  assumes  the \ntruth of all well-pled allegations in the complaint and draws all \nreasonable inferences in the Parents' favor.  See Zell v. Ricci, \n957 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 2020). \nA.  Student Experience at Baird Middle School \nBaird  Middle  School  is  a  public  school  in  Ludlow, \nMassachusetts.    Early  in  the  2020-21  school  year,  sixth-grade \nstudents at Baird, including eleven-year-old B.F. (\"the Student\"), \nwere  given  an  assignment  by  the  school's  librarian  to  create \nbiographic videos about themselves.  According to the Parents' \ncomplaint,  the  librarian,  Jordan  Funke,  encouraged  students  to \ninclude their pronouns in their videos.  The Parents' complaint \ndoes not state how the Student, designated the female sex at birth, \nresponded  to  this  school  assignment.    But  in  the  months  that \nfollowed  the  assignment,  the  Student's  school  Google  account \n- 5 - \n\nCase: 23-1069     Document: 00118249041     Page: 6      Date Filed: 02/18/2025      Entry ID: 6700937\n     \nstarted receiving \"unsolicited LGBTQ-themed video suggestions\" on \ntheir school-issued computer.  After watching these clips, the \nStudent  began  questioning  whether  they  \"might  be  attracted  to \ngirls\" and whether they \"ha[d] 'gender identity' issues.\" \nBy December 2020, the Student sought out their teacher, \nBonnie  Manchester,  to  have  a  meeting  to  discuss  some  personal \nissues.  At that meeting, the Student indicated they were depressed \nand struggling with insecurity, low self-esteem, poor self-image, \nand a perceived lack of popularity.  The Student told Manchester \nthey needed help, but they were unsure of how to ask their parents \nabout getting that help.  Manchester offered to call the Student's \nparents and -- after reviewing the Student's situation with other \nteachers  during  a  school  planning  meeting  and  hearing  other \nteachers agree that the Student seemed depressed -- Manchester \ncontacted the Parents. \nManchester told the Student's mother, appellant Marissa \nSilvestri, that the Student felt depressed, was experiencing self-\nimage issues, and may have been attracted to members of the same \nsex.  Silvestri \"was grateful\" Manchester reached out \"so that \n[Silvestri] and\" the Student's father, appellant Stephen Foote, \n\"could address [the Student's] mental health issues\" themselves.  \nTo that end, Silvestri sent the following email in December 2020 \nto Baird's principal, Stacy Monette; the then-Superintendent of \n- 6 - \n\nCase: 23-1069     Document: 00118249041     Page: 7      Date Filed: 02/18/2025      Entry ID: 6700937\n     \nLudlow Public Schools, Todd Gazda; members of the Ludlow School \nCommittee; and all the Student's teachers: \nIt has been brought to the attention of both Stephen and \nmyself  that  some  of  [the  Student's]  teachers  are \nconcerned with her mental health.  I appreciate your \nconcern and would like to let you know that her father \nand I will be getting her the professional help she needs \nat this time.  With that being said, we request that you \ndo not have any private conversations with [the Student] \nin regards to this matter.  Please allow us to address \nthis as a family and with the proper professionals. \n    Unbeknownst to the Parents, in a February 28, 2021 email \nsent to Baird's teachers and the school's counselor, Marie-Claire \nFoley, and to Superintendent Gazda, the Student announced, \"I am \ngenderqueer.\"  According to the Student's email declaration, that \nmeant  that  the  Student  would  \"use  any  pronouns  (other  than \nit/its),\" and it also meant the Student preferenced a name change \n-- they asked to go by the name \"R***\" instead of \"B***\".  Upon \nreceipt of the email and after meeting privately with the Student, \nCounselor Foley learned that the Student was still in the process \nof  explaining  these  identity  developments  to  their  parents.  \nConsistent with the Student's request, Foley directed Baird staff \nto use the name \"B***\" and she/her pronouns when communicating \nwith the Student's parents, but during school times, to address \nthe Student as \"R***\". \n    Following  this  directive,  some  teachers  immediately \nstarted referring to the Student as \"R***\" and changed nametags \naccordingly.  Funke, the school librarian, spoke with the Student \n- 7 - \n\nCase: 23-1069     Document: 00118249041     Page: 8      Date Filed: 02/18/2025      Entry ID: 6700937\n     \none-on-one about gender identity and provided the Student with \nLGBTQ-related resources.  And Counselor Foley told the Student \nthat they could choose which bathroom to use -- boys', girls', or \nthe gender-neutral facilities at the school.3 \nB.  DESE Guidance and the Protocol  \nThis is where Ludlow's Protocol comes into play.  To \nexplain  it  and  its  implementation,  though,  it  behooves  us  to \ninterrupt our narrative in order to provide the gentle reader with \nsome important background on how the Protocol came to be. \nIn 2012, the Commonwealth's Department of Elementary and \nSecondary  Education  (\"DESE\")  issued  a  non-binding  guidance \ndocument regarding gender-identity issues (\"DESE Guidance\").4  The \nDESE Guidance was published to help school districts comply with \nMassachusetts's then newly enacted statutory prohibition against \n \n3 The Student's twelve-year-old sibling attended Baird Middle \nSchool at the same time as the Student.  Around the same time as \nthe above-described events were playing out, the Student's sibling \nalso  started  using  a  name  and  pronouns  differing  from  those \nprovided to the sibling at birth.  Though the Parents allege that \nLudlow applied the Protocol with respect to both of their children, \nthe operative complaint provides scant relevant details specific \nto the Student's sibling.  We therefore conclude that a claim was \nnot stated for the Student's sibling and focus our coming analysis \nsolely on the Protocol as applied to the Student. \n4 A pause here to note that the Parents' complaint quotes \nportions of the DESE Guidance.  We may take judicial notice of \nother parts of the document.  See, e.g., Gent v. CUNA Mut. Ins. \nSoc'y, 611 F.3d 79, 84 n.5 (1st Cir. 2010) (taking judicial notice \nof relevant facts provided on a government website that were \"not \nsubject to reasonable dispute\"). \n- 8 - \n\nCase: 23-1069     Document: 00118249041     Page: 9      Date Filed: 02/18/2025      Entry ID: 6700937\n     \ndiscrimination based on gender identity in public schools.  See \nMass. Gen. Laws ch. 76, § 5 (effective July 1, 2012).5  The Guidance \ncontains policy suggestions for schools navigating issues related \nto gender discrimination.  For example, when a student consistently \nasserts a particular gender identity, the DESE Guidance recommends \nthat the school accept that student's stated gender.  This approach \naligns  with  the  Commonwealth's  statutory  recognition  that  a \nperson's  gender  identity  may  be  based  on  their  \"identity, \nappearance or behavior,\" rather than that person's \"physiology or \nassigned sex at birth.\"  Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 4, § 7. \nThe  DESE  Guidance  also  addresses  potential  conflict \nbetween parents and students.  Noting that \"[s]ome transgender and \ngender nonconforming students are not openly so at home for reasons \nsuch as safety concerns or lack of acceptance,\" the DESE Guidance \nsuggests that \"[s]chool personnel should speak with [a] student \nfirst before discussing [that] student's gender nonconformity or \ntransgender  status  with  the  student's  parent  or  guardian.\"    \nConsistent  with  that  suggested  deference  to  the  student,  the \n \n5 In 2011, the Massachusetts legislature approved amendments \nto several antidiscrimination statutes to add gender identity as \na protected classification, along with race, color, sex, religion, \nnational origin, and sexual orientation.  See 2011 Mass. Acts 866.  \nAmong  the  amended  statutes  is  a  provision  prohibiting \ndiscrimination against protected classes in public schools.  See \nMass. Gen. Laws ch. 76, § 5.  In July 2012, DESE in turn included \ngender identity as a protected class in certain antidiscrimination \nregulations.  See 603 Mass. Code Regs. 26.00. \n- 9 - \n\nCase: 23-1069     Document: 00118249041     Page: 10      Date Filed: 02/18/2025      Entry ID: 6700937\n     \ndocument directs \"school personnel [to] discuss with the student \nhow  the  school  should  refer  to  the  student,  e.g.,  appropriate \npronoun use, in written communication to the student's parent or \nguardian.\"  These recommendations reflect the general Commonwealth \nphilosophy  stated  in  the  DESE  Guidance  that  \"the  person  best \nsituated to determine a student's gender identity is that student.\" \nNow, to Ludlow and Baird Middle School, where the School \nCommittee  and  some  individual  defendants  (like  Superintendent \nGazda)  used  the  DESE  Guidance  to  establish  and  implement  the \nProtocol.  The Protocol is an unwritten policy that allows students \nof any age \"to determine whether their parents will be notified \nabout decisions related to affirming [their own] discordant gender \nidentity.\"    In  other  words,  Ludlow's  Protocol  is  one  of \nnondisclosure, instructing teachers not to inform parents about \ntheir  child's  expressions  of  gender  without  that  student's \nconsent.  And as relevant here, Superintendent Gazda asserted that \nthe district's actions with respect to the Student complied with \nthe DESE Guidance and laws and regulations of Massachusetts. \nWith that explanation of the Protocol in the backdrop, \nlet's get back to how things unfolded at Baird Middle School. \nC.  The Parents Discover Ludlow's Protocol \n  In  early  March,  soon  after  the  Student  sent  their \nFebruary 28 email to school staff, the Parents learned about the \nStudent's alternate school name from Manchester, the teacher in \n- 10 - \n\nCase: 23-1069     Document: 00118249041     Page: 11      Date Filed: 02/18/2025      Entry ID: 6700937\n     \nwhom the Student had initially confided.  This discovery prompted \nthe Parents to speak with Principal Monette and Superintendent \nGazda in March 2021.  In these conversations, the Parents expressed \nconcern that Ludlow educators had disregarded Silvestri's December \n2020 email, which had provided \"specific instructions that school \nstaff not engage with [the Parents'] children regarding mental \nhealth issues.\"  As the Parents' complaint tells it, the school's \nrecognition of the Student's chosen name and pronouns constituted \na  \"psychosocial\"  mental  health  treatment  because  \"social \ntransitioning\"6 -- including the assertion of  chosen  names and \npronouns -- is \"recognized as a medical/mental health treatment \nfor children with gender dysphoria.\"7 \n  Superintendent  Gazda,  in  response,  defended  the \neducators who did not disclose information about the Student's \ngender identity to the Parents.  Under the laws and regulations of \nMassachusetts, said Gazda, Counselor Foley and other Baird staff \ntreated the Student appropriately. \n  Baird educators continued to affirm the Student's chosen \ngender and name.  For instance, the Parents noticed in April 2021 \n \n6 According to the Parents, a \"social transition\" involves \n\"changes  that  bring  the  child's  outer  appearance  and  lived \nexperience  into  alignment  with  the  child's  core  gender.\"    For \nexample, \"changes in clothing, name, pronouns, and hairstyle\" may \nindicate a child's social transition. \n7 Although the Parents mention gender dysphoria in passing, \nthey do not define the phrase or otherwise discuss it. \n- 11 - \n\nCase: 23-1069     Document: 00118249041     Page: 12      Date Filed: 02/18/2025      Entry ID: 6700937\n     \nthat one of the Baird teachers had mailed a card to the Student \nand addressed it to R.F., the Student's newly adopted name, rather \nthan to B.F.  And, throughout April and May 2021, Counselor Foley \ncorresponded with the Student via text messages and online chat \nabout their gender identity, and further encouraged the Student to \nmeet with her weekly to discuss any gender-related concerns.  In \none chat message conversation, Foley asked the Student if their \nparents \"were providing B.F. with appropriate care.\"  In another \ndiscussion, Foley asked if the Student was comfortable discussing \nissues with the non-school counselor chosen by their parents. \n  Superintendent  Gazda  voiced  his  support  for  Ludlow's \n\"gender-affirming\"  practices  at  a  May  2021  School  Committee \nmeeting,  explaining  that  the  district's  policies  fostered \ninclusion and sought to make schools safe for all children.  He \nadded that, under his leadership, Ludlow would \"continue to help \n. . . children 'express who they are' despite parents' wishes to \nthe contrary.\"  He emphasized that for many students, \"school is \ntheir only safe place, and that safety evaporates when they leave \nthe confines of our buildings.\"  Gazda reiterated his view that \nthe  school's  approach  adhered  to  Massachusetts's \nnon-discrimination  laws  and  educational  guidelines.8    Gazda \n \n8 In a June 2021 School Committee meeting, Committee Chairman \nMichael Kelliher repeated Gazda's sentiment that Ludlow's actions \nwere \"in compliance\" with the relevant laws. \n- 12 - \n\nCase: 23-1069     Document: 00118249041     Page: 13      Date Filed: 02/18/2025      Entry ID: 6700937\n     \nexplained  that  the  district's  actions  complied  with  the  DESE \nGuidance (that guidance document we mentioned a few pages ago). \nD.  How The Case Got Here \n  In time, the Parents sued the Town of Ludlow and the \nLudlow  School  Committee  as  well  as  Todd  Gazda,  Stacy  Monette, \nMarie-Claire Foley, and Jordan Funke in federal court, asserting \nconstitutional claims under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.  Their operative \ncomplaint chiefly alleges that the defendants' conduct restricted \ntheir fundamental parental rights protected by the Due Process \nClause  of  the  Fourteenth  Amendment  of  the  United  States \nConstitution, including: (1) the right to direct the education and \nupbringing of their children (Count I); (2) the right to make \nmedical and mental health decisions for their children (Count II); \nand (3) the right to familial privacy (Count III).9 \nIn response, the defendants moved to dismiss the action \nunder Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) for failure to state \na claim.  In a thoughtful rescript, the district court granted the \ndefendants' motion, and in doing so, made several determinations.  \nIn short, as to Count II, it held that the Parents had failed to \nallege that Ludlow's conduct involved medical treatment.  See Foote \nv. Town of Ludlow, Civ. No. 22-30041-MGM, 2022 WL 18356421, at *5 \n(D. Mass. Dec. 14, 2022).  As for the remaining claims, the court \n \n9 The Parents do not mount a challenge to the DESE Guidance \nin this litigation. \n- 13 - \n\nCase: 23-1069     Document: 00118249041     Page: 14      Date Filed: 02/18/2025      Entry ID: 6700937\n     \nconcluded more broadly that the Parents had not alleged the sort \nof  \"conscience-shocking\"  conduct  required  by  Supreme  Court \nprecedent to establish a substantive due process violation.  Id. \nat *8.  The court went on to hold that even if the Parents could \nstate a substantive due process claim, the individual educators \nwould  be  entitled  to  qualified  immunity.    Id.    The  Parents \ndissatisfied, this appeal followed and here we are. \nWe review the district court's Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal \nof the Parents' complaint de novo.  See Burt v. Bd. of Trs. of \nUniv. of R.I., 84 F.4th 42, 50 (1st Cir. 2023).  In undertaking \nthis task, we remind that \"[w]e are not bound by the district \ncourt's reasoning but, rather, may affirm . . . on any ground made \nmanifest by the record.\"  Id. \nII.  DISCUSSION \n  Out of the starting gate, we reasonably begin by getting \nour constitutional law bearings on the Fourteenth Amendment Due \nProcess Clause doctrine at play here.  That doctrinal provision \ndeclares that \"[n]o State shall . . . deprive any person of life, \nliberty, or property, without due process of law.\"  U.S. Const. \namend. XIV, § 1.  And as our judicial superiors repeatedly tell \nus, it uncontrovertibly protects against governmental infringement \nof both procedural and substantive rights.  Elaborating on those \nsafeguards, the Supreme Court has held for nearly one hundred years \nthat the Due Process Clause's explicit promise of \"liberty\" ensures \n- 14 - \n\nCase: 23-1069     Document: 00118249041     Page: 15      Date Filed: 02/18/2025      Entry ID: 6700937\n     \ncertain fundamental rights.  Pertinently among those substantive \nliberty  interests  is  the  right  of  parents  to  make  decisions \nconcerning \"the care, custody, and control of their children.\"  \nTroxel v. Granville, 530 U.S. 57, 65 (2000) (plurality opinion); \nsee also Pierce v. Soc'y of Sisters, 268 U.S. 510, 534 (1925) (the \nright to \"direct the upbringing and education of children\"); Meyer \nv. Nebraska, 262 U.S. 390, 399 (1923) (the right to \"bring up \nchildren\").  Such fundamental rights, urge the Parents, are the \nbig-picture items at stake in today's proceedings. \nOrdinarily, to determine whether some government conduct \nhas  violated  substantive  due  process  rights,  courts  must \nundertake, as our precedent dictates, a layered inquiry.  It begins \nby  asking  whether  the  challenged  government  conduct  \"is \nlegislative or executive in nature.\"  DePoutot v. Raffaelly, 424 \nF.3d 112, 118 (1st Cir. 2005).  We ask that question because the \nanswer to it directs which analytical pathway we must follow and \nwhich level of scrutiny we will apply to determine if the Parents' \ndue process rights have been violated.10 \nLet's begin. \n \n10  Rational  basis  applies  where  plaintiffs  have  failed  to \nidentify a fundamental right or when, even if plaintiffs have done \nso,  the  challenged  governmental  action  does  not  restrict  that \nright. \n- 15 - \n\nCase: 23-1069     Document: 00118249041     Page: 16      Date Filed: 02/18/2025      Entry ID: 6700937\n     \nA.  Executive or Legislative Conduct \nCategorizing  government  conduct  as  executive  or \nlegislative is not necessarily an easy task, particularly when the \nboundary between the two is not always well-defined and when some \ngovernment  conduct  can  even  straddle  the  line.    As  has  been \nobserved, sorting these close calls requires an eye for function, \nnot form.  See Hancock v. Cnty. of Rensselaer, 882 F.3d 58, 65 n.2 \n(2d Cir. 2018).  In that vein, sometimes the inquiry is simple.  \nIn most cases where a substantive due process challenge is brought, \nwe see that statutes and governmental policies are typically deemed \nlegislative; indeed, statutes are plainly legislative.  See Cook \nv. Gates, 528 F.3d 42, 56-60 (1st Cir. 2008) (analyzing substantive \ndue process challenge to \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\" statute without \nreference  to  the  shock-the-conscience  test).    On  the \nexecutive-conduct front, individual acts of government officials \nare often and ordinarily executive in nature, untethered from any \npolicy.  See Rochin v. California, 342 U.S. 165, 166, 172 (1952) \n(treating as executive action the forced pumping of a suspect's \nstomach  by  police  officers,  which  shocked  the  conscience); \nMartínez v. Cui, 608 F.3d 54, 63-64 (1st Cir. 2010) (applying the \nconscience-shocking test when a state employee was alleged to have \ncommitted a sexual assault).  Although administrative regulations \nand executive orders are both forms of executive policymaking, \nthey have nonetheless been classified as legislative in nature \n- 16 - \n\nCase: 23-1069     Document: 00118249041     Page: 17      Date Filed: 02/18/2025      Entry ID: 6700937\n     \nwhen they are broadly applicable.  See Nicholas v. Pa. State Univ., \n227 F.3d 133, 139 n.1 (3d Cir. 2000) (Alito, J.).  Same has been \ndeemed true for concerted actions by multiple government employees \nif taken \"pursuant to broad governmental policies\" -- such actions \nare closer to legislative conduct.  Abdi v. Wray, 942 F.3d 1019, \n1027-28 (10th Cir. 2019) (emphasis omitted) (declining to apply \nthe  shock-the-conscience  test  when  a  plaintiff  challenged  the \nFBI's \"No-Fly List,\" an executive policy akin to a legislative \nact). \nChallenges  to  executive  versus  legislative  conduct \ngarner different judicial examinations.  For a substantive due \nprocess challenge to an executive action to proceed, the conduct \nmust first satisfy the shock-the-conscience test.  See Martínez, \n608 F.3d at 64-65.  That test asks \"whether the behavior of the \ngovernmental officer is so egregious, so outrageous, that it may \nfairly be said to shock the contemporary conscience.\"  González-\nFuentes, 607 F.3d at 880 (quoting Cnty. of Sacramento v. Lewis, \n523 U.S. 833, 847 n.8 (1998)); see also DePoutot, 424 F.3d at \n119.11  If executive conduct does not shock the conscience, the \n \n11 To round things out for the curious reader, Lewis taught \nthat  \"[t]he  touchstone  of  due  process  is  protection  of  the \nindividual against arbitrary action of government,\" 523 U.S. at \n845  (quoting  Wolff  v.  McDonnell,  418  U.S.  539,  558  (1974)) \n(alteration in original), and \"only the most egregious official \nconduct can be said to be 'arbitrary in the constitutional sense,'\" \n- 17 - \n\nCase: 23-1069     Document: 00118249041     Page: 18      Date Filed: 02/18/2025      Entry ID: 6700937\n     \nplaintiff has failed to state a constitutional violation and the \ninquiry ends.  See González-Fuentes, 607 F.3d at 880 n.13.  Only \nif  the  executive  conduct  does  shock  the  conscience  will  the \nanalysis move on to the substantive due process framework's next \nstage  (whether  the  conduct  restricts  a  protected  fundamental \nright).  See id. \nOn the other hand, legislative conduct (like a statute, \na regulation, or a governmental policy of any kind) need not be \nconscience-shocking for further judicial inquiry to occur; rather, \ncourts proceed directly to the next layered step of the substantive \ndue  process  framework  (asking  whether  a  fundamental  right  is \ninvolved  and  whether  the  government  conduct  restricts  that \nfundamental right) before moving on.  See Washington v. Glucksberg, \n521 U.S. 702, 722 (1997). \nThe  general  executive  versus  legislative  parameters \nnoted, we get back to our case and what transpired below.  When \nthe defendants' motion to dismiss came before the district court, \nthe court did not undertake this initial \"executive or legislative\" \ninquiry.  Instead, it followed the parties' lead and treated the \nProtocol as an executive action, thus examining whether Ludlow's \nactions \"were so egregious as to shock the conscience,\" Harron v. \n \nid. at 846 (quoting Collins v. Harker Heights, 503 U.S. 115, 129 \n(1992)). \n- 18 - \n\nCase: 23-1069     Document: 00118249041     Page: 19      Date Filed: 02/18/2025      Entry ID: 6700937\n     \nTown of Franklin, 660 F.3d 531, 536 (1st Cir. 2011) (quoting Pagán \nv. Calderón, 448 F.3d 16, 32 (1st Cir. 2006)), i.e., using the \nstandard applied in substantive due process cases challenging only \nindividual actions by particular government officials, unmoored \nfrom any government policy, see Rochin, 342 U.S. at 172; Martínez, \n608 F.3d at 63-64.  The court then reasoned that Ludlow's conduct \nwas not \"so extreme, egregious, or outrageously offensive as to \nshock the contemporary conscience,\" Foote, 2022 WL 18356421, at *8 \n(quoting DePoutot, 424 F.3d at 119), and it therefore held the \nParents  had  failed  to  state  a  viable  substantive  due  process \nclaim.12 \nBut by our lights, the district court, in following the \nparties'  lead,  jumped  the  gun  in  not  analyzing  the  type  of \ngovernment conduct involved.  Though all roads, in the end, still \nlead to Rome, in our de novo review, we conclude the shock-the-\nconscience test was not the appropriate legal standard to utilize \nhere  in  examining  the  Parents'  claims  because  the  Parents  are \nchallenging a school policy, which, after our careful scrutiny of \nthe policy involved, we conclude is legislative, not executive \nconduct.  Here's why that is so. \n \n12 To be clear, technically, we note that the district court \napplied the shocks-the-conscience test only to Counts I and III.  \nFoote, 2022 WL 18356421, at *5-8.  Before it deployed the shocks-\nthe-conscience  test,  the  court  dismissed  Count  II  because  the \nParents hadn't adequately stated sufficient facts to support it \n(more on that later).  Id. at *5. \n- 19 - \n\nCase: 23-1069     Document: 00118249041     Page: 20      Date Filed: 02/18/2025      Entry ID: 6700937\n     \n  In  our  assessment  of  the  precedent,  as  between \nlegislative and executive conduct, the Protocol (the chief target \nof the Parents' complaint) better fits into the legislative bucket.  \nWe so conclude because it is a policy which applies broadly to all \nstudents  in  the  Ludlow  School  District  and  is  administered  by \nmultiple governmental actors.  See Nicholas, 227 F.3d at 139 n.1.  \nAnd although the Parents also challenge some individual actions of \nLudlow educators -- for example, the complaint objects to teachers \ndiscussing  gender  identity  with  students,  providing \ngender-identity  resources  to  some  students,  and  allowing \ntransgender students to use the bathroom of their choosing -- those \ndiscrete decisions by individual educators were taken to \"actively \nimplement and reinforce the Protocol,\" as alleged by the Parents.  \nSee Abdi, 942 F.3d at 1027-28.  In applying the Protocol to their \ninteractions with students, those educators did not exercise the \nsort  of  \"instant  judgment\"  typically  associated with  executive \nconduct.    See,  e.g.,  Lewis,  523  U.S.  at  837,  853  (aggressive \nmaneuver by law enforcement officers to apprehend a suspect during \na high-speed chase).  So again, the Parents' complaint, at bottom, \nis better viewed as a challenge to legislative conduct.13  \n \n13 By the way, we do not treat the Parents' request that the \ndistrict court apply the shock-the-conscience test as a waiver \nbecause parties may not waive or stipulate to the appropriate legal \ntest.  See TI Fed. Credit Union v.

A Fundamental Right \nThe  Parents  say  yes:    They  claim  Ludlow's  conduct \nrestricted  their  parental  right  to  control  the  upbringing, \ncustody, education, and medical treatment of their child.15  Our \n \ntainted by self-interest.  Courts, accordingly, 'are not bound to \naccept  as  controlling,  stipulations  as  to  questions  of  law.'\" \n(quoting Sanford's Est. v. Comm'r, 308 U.S. 39, 51 (1939))); see \nalso Kamen v. Kemper Fin. Servs., Inc., 500 U.S. 90, 99 (1991) \n(\"When an issue or claim is properly before the court, the court \nis not limited to the particular legal theories advanced by the \nparties, but rather retains the independent power to identify and \napply the proper construction of governing law.\"). \n14 As we embark on this enquiry, recall that the substantive \ndue process analysis involves a series of queries.  We'll unpack \nall of this in more detail in the pages to come, but here's our \n50,000-foot  view  of  the  basic  progression  we  glean  from  the \nprecedent.  First, we ask whether a party has adequately alleged \na right recognized as fundamental.  Then, we assess whether the \ngovernment conduct at issue is alleged to have restricted that \nright.  The work does not stop there -- because regardless of how \nthat second question is answered, the conduct still must withstand \nthe appropriate level of constitutional scrutiny.  Indeed, if the \nanswer  is  yes,  the  conduct  is  alleged  to  have  restricted  a \nfundamental  right,  then  we  examine  whether  the  restriction \nsatisfies the appropriate level of heightened scrutiny; if the \nanswer is no, then we determine whether the government conduct \nsurvives rational basis review.  \n15 The Parents' complaint distinguishes between the parental \nright to direct the education and upbringing of their children \n(Count I), the parental right to direct the medical treatment of \ntheir children (Count II), and the parental right to family privacy \n- 21 - \n\nCase: 23-1069     Document: 00118249041     Page: 22      Date Filed: 02/18/2025      Entry ID: 6700937\n     \njob, in resolving this contention, is twofold:  We must first \ndetermine whether the Parents have identified a right recognized \nas fundamental, and, if so, we must examine whether the Parents \nhave sufficiently pled that Ludlow's conduct did, in fact, restrict \nthat right.  This section attempts to do just that, starting with \nthe claimed right itself. \nOur guiding light in this realm is a trio of Supreme \nCourt parental right cases: Meyer v. Nebraska, 262 U.S. 390; Pierce \nv. Society of Sisters, 268 U.S. 510; and Troxel v. Granville, 530 \nU.S.  57.    Those  cases  define  the  parental  right  broadly  as  a \nfundamental right to direct the care, custody, and upbringing of \none's  children.    These  rights  are  \"perhaps  the  oldest  of  the \nfundamental liberty interests recognized by th[e] Court.\"  Troxel, \n530 U.S. at 65 (collecting cases).  The Supreme Court made clear \nmore than a century ago that the Due Process Clause gives parents \nthe right to \"bring up children\" and \"to control the education of \ntheir own.\"  Meyer, 262 U.S. at 399, 401 (invalidating a ban on \nforeign-language instruction). \n \n(Count III).  But the Parents do not explain how those three rights \ndiffer, or how those differences would alter our analysis.  Indeed, \nthe Parents' briefing generally refers to those rights as one and \nthe  same.    That  approach  makes  sense  because,  at  bottom,  the \nParents  challenge  Ludlow's  conduct  as  restricting  their \nfundamental right to direct the care, custody, and upbringing of \ntheir children as recognized in Meyer, Pierce, and Troxel. \nThus,  we  collectively  refer  to  the  rights  at  issue  as \n\"parental rights under the Due Process Clause.\" \n- 22 - \n\nCase: 23-1069     Document: 00118249041     Page: 23      Date Filed: 02/18/2025      Entry ID: 6700937\n     \n  When we drill down on the Supreme Court's teachings, we \nobserve that the Supreme Court's parental rights cases have never \ndescribed an asserted right by reference to the specific conduct \nat issue.  Meyer did not define the parents' asserted liberty \ninterest as the right to allow their child to learn German before \nthe eighth grade.  See id. at 397, 403 (striking down a Nebraska \nstatute prohibiting the teaching of foreign languages to students \nbefore completing the eighth grade).  Nor did Pierce describe the \nparental interest at stake as the right to send one's child to \nreligious school.  See 268 U.S. at 534-35 (invalidating Oregon's \ncompulsory public education statute).  And Troxel did not define \nthe right at issue as the right to prevent a grandparent from \nvisiting with one's grandchild.  See 530 U.S. at 72-73 (rejecting \napplication of a Washington statute that allowed any person to \npetition for visitation rights with a child, at any time, with the \nonly requirement being that the visitation serve the best interest \nof the child). \n  Rather, in each of those decisions, the Court instead \nconsidered whether the conduct at issue fell within the broader, \nwell-established parental right to direct the upbringing of one's \nchild.  See Meyer, 262 U.S. at 399-403; Pierce, 268 U.S. at 534-\n35; Troxel, 530 U.S. at 65-67.   \nWe  necessarily  follow  that  approach  in  the  instant \nmatter  and  thus  decline  to  define  the  right  at  issue  with \n- 23 - \n\nCase: 23-1069     Document: 00118249041     Page: 24      Date Filed: 02/18/2025      Entry ID: 6700937\n     \nmicroscopic granularity.  See Moore v. City of E. Cleveland, 431 \nU.S. 494, 503 (1977) (plurality opinion) (\"Appropriate limits on \nsubstantive due process come not from drawing arbitrary lines but \nrather from careful 'respect for the teachings of history (and) \nsolid recognition of the basic values that underlie our society.'\" \n(quoting Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479, 501 (1965) (Harlan, \nJ., concurring))).  So, with that guidance in mind, we conclude \nthat  the  Parents  have  identified  a  fundamental  right  in  their \ncomplaint with sufficient specificity.  See Troxel, 530 U.S. at \n67. \nBut as noted earlier, our inquiry does not end there.  \nNotwithstanding the Parents' adequately pled rights, we must still \ndetermine  whether  the  Parents  have  sufficiently  alleged  Ludlow \nengaged  in  conduct  that  actually  restricted  those  fundamental \nrights. \n    Here, the Parents argue that Ludlow's conduct restricted \ntheir substantive due process rights in three ways: (1) Ludlow \nperformed \"medical treatment\" on the Student through accepting the \nStudent's social transition without parental consent; (2) Ludlow \nfacilitated the Student's social transition to alternate genders \nvia  curricular  and  administrative  decisions  without  parental \nconsent; and (3) Ludlow implemented the Protocol, which deprived \nthe  Parents  of  information  about  the  Student's  expression  of \ngender.  We address each in turn, evaluating whether the Parents' \n- 24 - \n\nCase: 23-1069     Document: 00118249041     Page: 25      Date Filed: 02/18/2025      Entry ID: 6700937\n     \nclaims are plausibly alleged in line with the broad principles set \nforth by the Supreme Court's substantive due process canon. \n(1) Medical Treatment \n    We  begin  with  the  Parents'  allegation  that  Ludlow's \nconduct  restricted  their  fundamental  right  to  direct  medical \ntreatment  for  their  child.    To  repeat,  parents  do  have  a \n\"fundamental right to make decisions concerning the care, custody, \nand control of\" their children.  Troxel, 530 U.S. at 72.  That \nright  includes  the  parental  right  \"to  seek  and  follow  medical \nadvice\" concerning one's children.  Parham v. J.R., 442 U.S. 584, \n602 (1979).  Ludlow, the Parents allege, \"socially transitioned\" \ntheir child to a new gender identity by accommodating their child's \nrequest to use a new name and pronouns at school.  And, the Parents \ncontend, because \"'social transitioning' . . . is recognized as a \nmedical/mental  health  treatment  for  children  with  gender \ndysphoria,\" Ludlow was \"implementing a psychosocial treatment\" on \ntheir child.  The Parents conclude that, because Ludlow educators \nperformed a \"psychosocial treatment\" without parental knowledge or \nconsent, Ludlow usurped the Parents' fundamental right to direct \nmedical treatment for their child. \n    The  district  court  dismissed  this  claim  (Count  II) \nbecause  the  Parents  provided  only  \"conclusory  statements \ndescribing the use of preferred names and pronouns as mental health \ntreatment.\"  Foote, 2022 WL 18356421, at *5.  The Parents, for \n- 25 - \n\nCase: 23-1069     Document: 00118249041     Page: 26      Date Filed: 02/18/2025      Entry ID: 6700937\n     \nexample,  failed  to  allege  that  Ludlow's  use  of  the  Student's \nrequested pronouns involved a \"treatment plan\" of any sort.  Id.  \nThe district court, setting aside the conclusory allegations in \nthe Parents' complaint, held that the Parents had not adequately \npled that Ludlow \"usurped their right to make medical and mental \nhealth treatment decisions for their children.\"  Id. \n    We agree with the district court.16  Although the Parents \ndescribed the decisions made by Ludlow educators as \"mental health \ntreatment,\"  their  labeling,  without  more,  cannot  transform  the \nalleged conduct into a medical intervention.  The Parents allege, \nfor example, that Ludlow educators spoke in private with their \nchild to promote exploring and experimenting with alternative or \ndiscordant gender identities and facilitate their child's gender-\naffirming  social  transitioning,  which,  the  Parents  say, \nconstitutes mental health treatment.  Am. Compl. ¶¶ 46, 52, 53, \n78.  But on this appellate record, we are unconvinced that merely \nalleging Ludlow's use of gender-affirming pronouns or a gender-\naffirming name suffices to state a claim that the school provided \nmedical treatment to the Student.  In fact, while the Supreme Court \n \n16  The  district  court  properly  separated  the  factual \nallegations from the legal conclusions in the Parents' complaint.  \nSee Ocasio-Hernández v. Fortuño-Burset, 640 F.3d 1, 12 (1st Cir. \n2011)  (instructing  courts  to  disregard  \"statements  in  the \ncomplaint that merely offer 'legal conclusions couched as fact'\" \n(alterations and ellipses omitted) (quoting Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 \nU.S. 662, 678 (2009))).  We do the same. \n- 26 - \n\nCase: 23-1069     Document: 00118249041     Page: 27      Date Filed: 02/18/2025      Entry ID: 6700937\n     \nhas \"never specifically defined the scope of a parent's right to \ndirect her child's medical care,\" PJ ex rel. Jensen v. Wagner, 603 \nF.3d 1182, 1197 (10th Cir. 2010), the Parents fail to state a claim \nbecause their allegations as stated do not suffice to describe \nmedical treatment at all.  The leading Supreme Court decision on \nparental  control  of  medical  care,  Parham,  involved  a  child's \ninstitutionalization at a mental health hospital.  See 442 U.S. at \n615.17  The Sixth Circuit's decision in Kanuszewski v. Michigan \nDepartment of Health and Human Services suggested that a state \nactor's retention of blood samples from children without parental \nconsent violated substantive due process.  See 927 F.3d 396, 420 \n(6th Cir. 2019).  And the Tenth Circuit, in Dubbs v. Head Start, \nInc.,  suggested  that  a  government-funded  preschool  program \nviolated parents' right to direct their children's medical care \nwhere a nurse performed physical examinations and blood tests on \nchildren without parental notice or consent.  See 336 F.3d 1194, \n1203-04 (10th Cir. 2003). \n    Each of those cases involved intrusions upon the bodily \nintegrity  of  the  child  or  other  conduct  with  clinical \nsignificance -- whether through a medical procedure, examination, \nor  hospitalization.    Thus,  although  precedent  indicates  that \n \n17  Although  Parham  primarily  addressed  a  procedural  due \nprocess  claim,  the  Court's  analysis  relied  on  canonical  cases \nestablishing the substantive due process rights of parents, such \nas Meyer and Pierce.  See Parham, 442 U.S. at 602-04. \n- 27 - \n\nCase: 23-1069     Document: 00118249041     Page: 28      Date Filed: 02/18/2025      Entry ID: 6700937\n     \nparents  have  the  right  to  direct  their  children's  medical \ntreatment, whether that treatment is complex or more routine, the \nallegations here do not involve clinical conduct at all.  Solely \nas pled here, we do not believe that using the Student's chosen \nname  and  pronouns  --  something  people  routinely  do  with  one \nanother,  and  which  requires  no  special  training,  skill, \nmedication, or technology -- without more, can be reasonably viewed \nas evidencing some indicia of medicalization.  Indeed, when we \nview the complaint in the light most favorable to the Parents, we \nconclude their bare contention that Ludlow's practice constituted \nmedical treatment that restricted their parental right to control \ntheir child's medical care is not plausible.18  As the Supreme \nCourt reminds us, we need not abandon our \"judicial experience and \ncommon sense\" in our scrutiny of allegations pled.  Ashcroft v. \nIqbal,  556  U.S.  662,  679  (2009).    Hence,  the  district  court \ncorrectly dismissed Count II of the Parents' complaint. \n(2) Curricular and Administrative Decisions \n    The  Parents  also  claim  that  the  actions  of  Ludlow's \nteachers  and  staff  restricted  their  parental  rights  by \n\"facilitat[ing]\" the Student's gender-affirming social transition.  \nThey  cite  librarian  Funke's  request  that  students  state  their \n \n18 We need not opine on whether, under certain circumstances, \nacceding to a student's use of a chosen name and pronouns could \never constitute medical treatment. \n- 28 - \n\nCase: 23-1069     Document: 00118249041     Page: 29      Date Filed: 02/18/2025      Entry ID: 6700937\n     \npronouns as part of an academic, biographic video assignment, the \nteachers'  use  of  the  Student's  requested  name  and  pronouns  at \nschool,  counselor  Foley's  permitting  the  Student  to  use  the \nbathroom  of  their  choice,  and  Foley's  discussion  of  gender \nidentity-related concerns with the Student.  The Parents allege \nthat  these  actions,  taken  without  their  knowledge  or  consent, \nrestricted their fundamental right to direct the upbringing of \ntheir child. \n    The  measures  the  Parents  cite,  however,  all  involve \ndecisions by Ludlow's staff about how to reasonably meet diverse \nstudent needs within the school setting.  The Supreme Court has \nnever suggested that parents have the right to control a school's \ncurricular  or  administrative  decisions.    Rather,  the  Court's \nparental rights cases more essentially provide \"that the state \ncannot  prevent  parents  from  choosing  a  specific  educational \nprogram.\"  Parker v. Hurley, 514 F.3d 87, 101 (1st Cir. 2008) \n(quoting Brown v. Hot, Sexy & Safer Prods., Inc., 68 F.3d 525, 533 \n(1st Cir. 1995), abrogated on other grounds by DePoutot, 424 F.3d \nat 118 n.4).  Meyer, for example, struck down a Nebraska statute \nprohibiting the teaching of foreign languages in part because the \nlaw interfered with the parental right to procure such instruction \nfor their children.  See 262 U.S. at 401.  And Pierce invalidated \nan Oregon law requiring parents to send their children to public \nschool between the ages of eight and sixteen.  See 268 U.S. at \n- 29 - \n\nCase: 23-1069     Document: 00118249041     Page: 30      Date Filed: 02/18/2025      Entry ID: 6700937\n     \n534-35.  In both cases, the state had barred parents from enrolling \ntheir children in a particular educational track.  Yet neither \nMeyer  nor  Pierce  undermines  \"the  state's  power  to  prescribe  a \ncurriculum for institutions which it supports.\"  Meyer, 262 U.S. \nat 402; see also Pierce, 268 U.S. at 534 (\"No question is raised \nconcerning  the  power  of  the  state  reasonably  to  regulate  all \nschools . . . [and] to require . . . that certain studies plainly \nessential to good citizenship must be taught, and that nothing be \ntaught which is manifestly inimical to the public welfare.\"). \n    We  have  consistently  applied  these  principles  in \nrejecting  parental  control  over  curricular  and  administrative \ndecisions.  In Parker, for example, the plaintiff parents claimed \na right to \"be given prior notice by the school and the opportunity \nto exempt their young children from exposure to books they f[ound] \nreligiously  repugnant.\"    514  F.3d  at  90.    Two  books  at  issue \n\"portray[ed] diverse families, including families in which both \nparents [were] of the same gender,\" while another book \"depict[ed] \nand celebrate[d] a gay marriage.\"  Id.  In rejecting the parents' \nsubstantive due process claim, we noted that no federal court had \never held that the Due Process Clause \"permitted parents to demand \nan exemption for their children from exposure to certain books \nused in public schools.\"  Id. at 102.  We concluded that, once \nparents choose to send their children to public school, \"they do \nnot have a constitutional right to 'direct how a public school \n- 30 - \n\nCase: 23-1069     Document: 00118249041     Page: 31      Date Filed: 02/18/2025      Entry ID: 6700937\n     \nteaches their child.'\"  Id. (quoting Blau v. Fort Thomas Pub. Sch. \nDist., 401 F.3d 381, 395 (6th Cir. 2005)).19 \nLikewise,  in  Brown,  we  considered  a  high  school's \nfailure to notify parents of their ability to exempt their children \nfrom a sex education presentation.  68 F.3d at 529-30.  Those \nparents sued, claiming the school's action -- well, inaction -- \nrestricted  their  substantive  due  process  right  to  direct  the \nupbringing of their children and educate them according to their \n \n19 This principle has been recognized in most circuits for \ndecades.  See, e.g., Fields v. Palmdale Sch.

Id.  at 532.  In rejecting the parents' claim, we \nexplained  that  Meyer  and  Pierce  protect  against  \"the  state \nproscribing parents from educating their children,\" not situations \nwhere parents seek to \"prescrib[e] what the state [should] teach \ntheir children.\"  Id. at 534 (emphases added).  In so doing, we \nemphasized  that  schools  need  not  \"cater  a  curriculum  for  each \nstudent whose parents had genuine moral disagreements with the \nschool's choice of subject matter.\"  Id. \n    The Parents' objections here are no different.  To the \nextent the Parents oppose certain academic assignments, the use of \na student's pronouns in the classroom, decisions about bathroom \naccess, and a guidance counselor speaking to a student, none of \nthose  concerns  restrict  parental  rights  under  the  Due  Process \nClause.    Rather,  the  Parents  are  challenging  how  Baird  Middle \nSchool  chooses  to  maintain  what  it  considers  a  desirable  and \nfruitful pedagogical environment.  Though the parents in Parker \nand  Brown  specifically  challenged  curricula,  our  rejection  of \nthose claims recognized the broad discretion of schools to manage \nacademic and administrative functions.  See, e.g., Parker, 514 \nF.3d at 102; Brown, 68 F.3d at 534.  Indeed, \"[w]hether it is the \nschool curriculum, the hours of the school day, school discipline, \nthe timing and content of examinations, the individuals hired to \nteach at the school, the extracurricular activities offered at the \nschool or . . . dress code[s], these issues of public education \n- 32 - \n\nCase: 23-1069     Document: 00118249041     Page: 33      Date Filed: 02/18/2025      Entry ID: 6700937\n     \nare  generally  'committed  to  the  control  of  state  and  local \nauthorities.'\"  Blau, 401 F.3d at 395-96 (quoting Goss v. Lopez, \n419 U.S. 565, 578 (1975)).  So it is here. \n    Because  public  schools  need  not  offer  students  an \neducational  experience  tailored  to  the  preferences  of  their \nparents, see Brown, 68 F.3d at 534, the Due Process Clause gives \nthe Parents no right to veto the curricular and administrative \ndecisions identified in the complaint. \n(3) The Protocol \nWe  come  now  to  the  Parents'  challenge  to  Ludlow's \nnondisclosure Protocol.  As alleged by the Parents' complaint, the \nProtocol provides that \"parents are not to be informed of their \nchild's transgender status and gender-affirming social transition \nto a discordant gender identity unless the child, of any age, \nconsents.\"  The Protocol, the Parents argue, restricted their right \nto direct their child's upbringing in that it deceived them and, \nin doing so, deprived them of information about the Student.  But, \nas we'll unpack, the Parents' challenge here fails. \nFor  starters,  Ludlow's  Protocol  of  deference  to  a \nstudent's decision about whether to disclose their gender identity \nto their parents lacks the \"coercive\" or \"restraining\" conduct \nthat other courts have found to restrict parental rights in this \ncontext.  J.S. ex rel. Snyder v. Blue Mountain Sch. Dist., 650 \nF.3d 915, 934 (3d Cir. 2011) (quoting Anspach ex rel.

Health, 503 F.3d 256, 266 (3d Cir. \n2007)).  In Arnold v. Board of Education of Escambia County, for \nexample, the Eleventh Circuit held that school officials violated \nparental rights by coercing a minor into having an abortion and \nconcealing the decision from her parents.  880 F.2d 305, 312-13 \n(11th  Cir.  1989),  overruled  on  other  grounds  by  Leatherman  v. \nTarrant Cnty. Narcotics Intel. and Coordination Unit, 507 U.S. 163 \n(1993).  There, a school counselor demanded that the student have \nan  abortion,  and  school  officials  provided  the  money  and \ntransportation necessary for the procedure.  Id. at 309, 313.  And, \nunlike  Ludlow's  deference  to  the  Student,  school  officials  in \nArnold \"coerced the minors to refrain from consulting with their \nparents.\"  Id. at 312. \nHere, by contrast, there are no allegations of coercive \nconduct  towards  the  Student.    The  Parents  object  to  Ludlow \nemployees sharing resources about gender expression and to the \nmessages from Counselor Foley to the Student asking if the Parents \nand the Parents' counselor were providing adequate care for the \nStudent.  But providing educational resources about LGBTQ-related \nissues to a child who has shown interest imposes no more compulsion \nto identify as genderqueer than providing a book about brick laying \ncould coerce a student into becoming a mason.  See Anspach, 503 \nF.3d at 266 (rejecting assertion that \"the atmosphere at the Center \nwas sufficiently coercive\").  Nor are the chat messages coercive, \n- 34 - \n\nCase: 23-1069     Document: 00118249041     Page: 35      Date Filed: 02/18/2025      Entry ID: 6700937\n     \neven when viewed in a light most favorable to the Parents.  Those \nmessages  cannot  reasonably  be  viewed  as  strongarm  statements; \nrather, they are essentially questions from a school counselor \ntrying to assess the well-being of a student. \nThe  Parents,  however,  also  claim  that  Ludlow \n\"deliberately deceive[d] parents . . . by continuing to refer to \ntheir child by [their] birth name and pronouns in the presence of \nthe parents, [while using] the child's preferred alternative name \nand  pronouns  at  all  other  times.\"    Viewed  in  the  light  most \nfavorable to the Parents, this allegation arguably challenges a \nrestraining act by Ludlow -- that is, deceptive communication to \nthe Parents about a child's expression of gender in school.  Cf. \nSnyder, 650 F.3d at 934 (noting that \"manipulative\" conduct by the \ngovernment  could  interfere  with  parental  rights  under  the  Due \nProcess Clause (quoting Anspach, 503 F.3d at 265)). \nThis  theory  of  affirmative  misrepresentation  is \nunavailing here.  The complaint contains only general allegations \nthat,  under  the  Protocol,  Ludlow  educators  were  directed  to \n\"intentionally misinform[] and lie[]\" to the Parents about the \nStudent's requested name and pronouns.  But, and as the Parents \ncontradictorily state in their complaint, when a teacher mailed a \ncard  to  the  Student  at  home,  it  was  addressed  to  \"R.F.\",  the \nStudent's  newly  identified  name,  not  \"B.F.,\"  the  Student's \nassigned-at-birth name.  And no allegation suggests that, when the \n- 35 - \n\nCase: 23-1069     Document: 00118249041     Page: 36      Date Filed: 02/18/2025      Entry ID: 6700937\n     \nParents tried to speak with school officials about the Student, \nthe officials misrepresented the name the Student had chosen for \nin-school  use.    Rather,  the  officials  (beyond  Manchester's \ncommunications  with  the  Parents)  just  declined  to  discuss  the \nStudent's gender identity issues with the Parents. \nBeyond this theory of affirmative deception, the Parents \nalso mount a challenge to the withholding of information about a \nstudent's  expression  of  gender  while  at  school.    But  this \nnondisclosure  angle  similarly  does  not  state  a  constitutional \ndeprivation.  That is because it is clear to us from precedent \nthat in attempting to establish a constitutional deprivation of \nthis sort, it is not enough for the Parents to allege that the \nnondisclosure  Protocol  makes  their  parenting  more  challenging.  \nThe guarantee of substantive due process limits \"the State's power \nto act\" by forbidding governments from \"depriv[ing] individuals of \nlife, liberty, or property without 'due process of law.'\"  See \nDeShaney v. Winnebago Cnty. Dep't of Soc. Servs., 489 U.S. 189, \n195 (1989) (rejecting substantive due process claim based on social \nworkers' failure to protect a child from abuse).  Yet the Supreme \nCourt has made clear that the Due Process Clause \"cannot fairly be \nextended to impose an affirmative obligation on the State to ensure \nthat those interests do not come to harm through other means.\"  \nId. \n- 36 - \n\nCase: 23-1069     Document: 00118249041     Page: 37      Date Filed: 02/18/2025      Entry ID: 6700937\n     \nAs  other  circuits  have  concluded,  this  limiting \nprinciple applies to parental rights.  See, e.g., Anspach, 503 \nF.3d at 262; Doe v. Irwin, 615 F.2d 1162, 1168 (6th Cir. 1980).  \nIn Anspach, the parents of a sixteen-year-old girl sued a city-run \nhealth  center  that  provided  their  daughter  with  emergency \ncontraception  medication,  alleging  that  the  facility  violated \ntheir substantive due process right to family relations.  503 F.3d \nat 259-61.  The center, according to the parents, not only \"failed \nto  encourage  [the  minor]  to  consult  with  her  parents  before \ndeciding  whether  to  take  emergency  contraception,\"  but  even \n\"intended to influence [the minor] to refrain from discussing with \nher  parents  her  possible  pregnancy.\"    Id.  at  262.    And,  more \nbroadly, the parents alleged \"that the [c]enter's policies were \naimed at preventing parents from learning of their minor daughter's \npossible pregnancies.\"  Id. at 261. \nThe Third Circuit rejected the parents' claim because \nthere is no \"constitutional obligation on state actors to contact \nparents  of  a  minor  or  to  encourage  minors  to  contact  their \nparents.\"  Id. at 262.  In elaborating, the court observed that \nthe \"real problem\" alleged by the parents was \"not that the state \nactors interfered with the [plaintiffs] as parents; rather, it \n[wa]s that the state actors did not assist [the plaintiffs] as \nparents or affirmatively foster the parent/child relationship.\"  \nId. at 266. \n- 37 - \n\nCase: 23-1069     Document: 00118249041     Page: 38      Date Filed: 02/18/2025      Entry ID: 6700937\n     \nA cognizable parental rights claim under the Due Process \nClause,  the  Third  Circuit  explained,  generally  requires \nrestraining conduct by the government, not mere nondisclosure of \ninformation.  Id. at 266.  The court held that the health center \nengaged in no such conduct because it did not \"prevent[] [the \nminor] from calling her parents before she took the pills she had \nrequested.\"    Id.  at  264.    \"Although  [the  parents']  moral  and \nreligious sensibilities may have been offended by their daughter \nseeking out and using emergency contraception, her decision was \nvoluntary.\"  Id. at 268.  Thus, because the Due Process Clause \n\"does not protect parental sensibilities, nor guarantee that a \nchild will follow their parents' moral directives,\" the parents' \nconstitutional rights were not restricted.  Id. \nThe Sixth Circuit adopted a similar view of parental \nrights  under  the  Due  Process  Clause  in  Doe  v.  Irwin.    There, \nparents of minor children sued a publicly funded family planning \nclinic, alleging that the clinic's distribution of contraceptives \nto minors without parental notice violated their parental rights.  \n615  F.2d  at  1163.    The  district  court,  which  enjoined  that \npractice,  held  that  the  clinic  interfered  with  the  parents' \nfundamental rights because the parents were \"prevented from being \nmade aware of the actions of a state-run agency which facilitate[d] \na situation inimical to the values the parents [we]re attempting \nto  teach  their  children.\"    Id.  at  1166.    The  Sixth  Circuit \n- 38 - \n\nCase: 23-1069     Document: 00118249041     Page: 39      Date Filed: 02/18/2025      Entry ID: 6700937\n     \nreversed,  explaining  that  the  Supreme  Court's  parental  rights \ncases -- such as Meyer and Pierce -- each involved situations where \n\"the state was either requiring or prohibiting some activity.\"  \nId. at 1168.  The clinic, in contrast, never \"require[d] that the \nchildren  of  the  plaintiffs  avail  themselves  of  the  services \noffered.\"    Id.    Nor  did  the  clinic  prohibit  the  parents  from \n\"participating in decisions of their minor children on issues of \nsexual activity and birth control.\"  Id.  In fact, the parents \nremained \"free to exercise their traditional care, custody and \ncontrol over their unemancipated children.\"  Id.  The bottom line \nwas  that  \"the  practice  of  not  notifying  [parents]  of  their \nchildren's voluntary decisions\" did not deprive the parents of a \nprotected liberty interest.  Id. \nHere,  too,  the  challenged  governmental  action  (the \nProtocol) merely instructs teachers not to offer information -- a \nstudent's gender identity -- without a student's consent.  In the \ninstant matter, the Parents remain free to strive to mold their \nchild according to the Parents' own beliefs, whether through direct \nconversations,  private  educational  institutions,  religious \nprogramming,  homeschooling,  or  other  influential  tools.    See \nAnspach, 503 F.3d at 266. \nThe Parents disagree that these alternatives suffice to \nprotect their rights.  They allege that the Protocol impermissibly \ninfringes  on  their  ability  to  use  these  methods  to  guide  the \n- 39 - \n\nCase: 23-1069     Document: 00118249041     Page: 40      Date Filed: 02/18/2025      Entry ID: 6700937\n     \nupbringing  of  the  Student  because  they  are  denied  important \ninformation about the Student's gender.  But the Protocol operates \nonly  in  the  school  setting,  where  --  as  we  have  explained  -- \nparents have less authority over decision-making concerning their \nchildren.  Outside school, parents can obtain information about \ntheir children's relationship to gender in many ways, including \ncommunicating  with  their  children  and  making  meaningful \nobservations of the universe of circumstances that influence their \nchildren's  preferences,  such  as  in  clothing,  extracurricular \nactivities,  movies,  television,  music,  internet  activity,  and \nmore. \nTo be sure, knowing that the Student had requested the \nuse of an alternative name and pronouns in school might inform how \nthe Parents respond to and direct their child's gender expressions \noutside  of  school.    In  all  likelihood,  the  Student's  lack  of \nconsent to share their in-school gender choices with their Parents \nmight  mean  they  would  be  cautious  outside  of  school  to  avoid \nsignals  that  might  disclose  those  choices.    Indeed,  we  are \nsympathetic to the Parents' interest in having as much information \nas possible about their child's well-being and behavior in school \nrevealed to them.  Nonetheless, as we have explained, our survey \nof Due Process Clause jurisprudence suggests that this canon does \nnot  require  governments  to  assist  parents  in  exercising  their \nfundamental right to direct the upbringing of their children, and \n- 40 - \n\nCase: 23-1069     Document: 00118249041     Page: 41      Date Filed: 02/18/2025      Entry ID: 6700937\n     \nthe Parents' objections to the Protocol here in large part take \nissue with that principle as we understand it to be. \nIn any event, as the complaint makes clear, the Parents \ndid learn from school staff about the Student's use of a different \nname and pronouns within days of those changes and discussed those \nchanges with school leadership.  In this as-applied challenge, we \nconclude that the allegations in the Parents' complaint about how \nthe Protocol was implemented with respect to the Student did not \nrestrict  any  fundamental  parental  right  protected  by  the  Due \nProcess Clause.20 \nC.  Applying Constitutional Scrutiny \nLet's regroup:  We've concluded that the Parents have \nnot  plausibly  alleged  that  Ludlow's  conduct  restricted  a \nfundamental right.  Be that as it may, the conduct still must \nwithstand  constitutional  scrutiny.    Namely,  in  view  of  our \nno-restricted-fundamental-right  conclusion,  the  conduct  must \nsurvive  rational  basis  review.21    See,  e.g.,  González-Droz  v. \n \n20 In our determinations in this dispute, we emphasize that \nour  analysis  here  is  not  intended  to  categorically  preclude \nparental challenges to policies of public schools under the Due \nProcess Clause.  But see Parents for Priv. v. Barr, 949 F.3d 1210, \n1232 (9th Cir. 2020). \n21 As we undertake this analysis, we focus on the Protocol \nitself, not on the actions taken to implement the Protocol.  If \nthe Protocol is constitutional, then simply acting in accordance \nwith  it  cannot  independently  be  unconstitutional.    See,  e.g., \nTimothy M. Tymkovich et al., A Workable Substantive Due Process, \n95  Notre  Dame  L.  Rev.  1961,  2003  (2020)  (\"If  the  policy  is \n- 41 - \n\nCase: 23-1069     Document: 00118249041     Page: 42      Date Filed: 02/18/2025      Entry ID: 6700937\n     \nGonzález–Colón, 660 F.3d 1, 9 (1st Cir. 2011) (explaining that \nrational basis review applies when a plaintiff fails to allege \nthat state conduct has infringed a fundamental right).  Under that \ndeferential standard, we presume the challenged conduct is valid \nso  long  as  it  \"is  rationally  related  to  a  legitimate  state \ninterest.\"  Id. (quoting City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Ctr., \nInc., 473 U.S. 432, 440 (1985)).  In performing rational basis \nreview, we consider only whether the state could have reasonably \nconcluded  that  the  challenged  conduct  \"might  advance  its \nlegitimate interests,\" id. at 10, and, ordinarily, the \"reasoning \n[that]  in  fact  underlay  the  legislative  decision\"  is \n\"constitutionally irrelevant,\" Kittery Motorcycle, Inc. v. Rowe, \n320 F.3d 42, 49 n.8 (1st Cir. 2003) (quoting U.S. R.R. Ret. Bd. v. \nFritz,  449  U.S.  166,  179  (1980)).    However,  \"some \nobjectives -- such  as  a  'bare  desire  to  harm  a  politically \nunpopular group' -- are not legitimate state interests.\"  Cleburne, \n473 U.S. at 446-47 (quoting U.S. Dept. of Agric. V. Moreno, 413 \nU.S. 528, 534 (1973))); see also Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U.S. 558, \n580 (2003) (O'Connor, J., concurring) (noting, in the context of \nthe  Equal  Protection  Clause,  that  \"a  more  searching  form  of \n \nconstitutional, then acting in accordance with it cannot 'shock \nthe conscience.'\"). \n- 42 - \n\nCase: 23-1069     Document: 00118249041     Page: 43      Date Filed: 02/18/2025      Entry ID: 6700937\n     \nrational basis review\" may apply where \"a law exhibits such a \ndesire to harm a politically unpopular group\").22 \nLudlow  asserts  an  interest  in  cultivating  a  safe, \ninclusive, and educationally conducive environment for students, \nwhich allows students to thrive and thus learn.  The Parents insist \nLudlow \"exceeded the bounds of legitimate pedagogical concerns and \nusurped the role of [the Parents] . . . to direct the upbringing \nof their children.\"  But in reasonable due deference to Ludlow's \narticulated policy rationale and based on its asserted interest, \nwe  conclude  Ludlow's  conduct  is  rationally  related  to  its \nlegitimate  stated  interest,  and  thus  the  Protocol  survives \nrational basis review. \nState actors have \"a compelling interest in protecting \nthe  physical  and  psychological  well-being  of  minors.\"    Sable \nCommc'ns of Cal., Inc. v. FCC, 492 U.S. 115, 126 (1989).  That \ninterest  is  at  its  apex  when  a  school  board  seeks  to  protect \nchildren  who  are  particularly  vulnerable,  such  as  transgender \nminors.  See Doe ex rel. Doe v. Boyertown Area Sch. Dist., 897 \n \n22 A quick note.  There is potential tension between the rights \nof the Parents and the rights of the Student that makes this case \ndifferent  from  previous  parental  rights  cases  decided  by  the \nSupreme Court.  Like, for example, the Student's right not to be \ndiscriminated against on the basis of sex, which is one of the \nstated rationales for the DESE Guidance.  Because this case centers \non the state interest and does not take up the rights of the \nStudent, though, our coming analysis is confined to a discussion \nof the former. \n- 43 - \n\nCase: 23-1069     Document: 00118249041     Page: 44      Date Filed: 02/18/2025      Entry ID: 6700937\n     \nF.3d 518, 528-29 (3d Cir. 2018) (holding that a school district \nhad a compelling interest in protecting the physical and mental \nwell-being  of  transgender  children).    Here,  we  refer  to  the \nCommonwealth's  investigative  findings  (articulated,  without \nrefute, in the motion to dismiss) which suggest that though many \nparents are supportive of their children's expression of gender, \nit is not uncommon for students exploring their gender identity to \nfear parental backlash against their choices.  See DESE Guidance \n(\"Some  transgender  and  gender  nonconforming  students  are  not \nopenly so at home for reasons such as safety concerns or lack of \nacceptance.\"). \nThe Protocol plausibly creates a space for students to \nexpress their identity without worrying about parental backlash.  \nBy  cultivating  an  environment  where  students  may  feel  safe  in \nexpressing their gender identity, the Protocol endeavors to remove \npsychological  barriers  for  transgender  students  and  equalizes \neducational opportunities.  See, e.g., Boyertown, 897 F.3d at 523 \n(\"[W]hen  transgender  students  are  addressed  with  gender \nappropriate pronouns and permitted to use facilities that conform \nto their gender identity, those students reflect the same, healthy \npsychological profile as their peers.\" (internal quotation marks \nomitted)); Grimm, 972 F.3d at 597 (explaining that \"transgender \nstudents  have  better  mental  health  outcomes  when  their  gender \nidentity is affirmed\"). \n- 44 - \n\nCase: 23-1069     Document: 00118249041     Page: 45      Date Filed: 02/18/2025      Entry ID: 6700937\n     \nIn sum, the Protocol bears a rational relationship to \nthe  legitimate  objective  of  promoting  a  safe  and  inclusive \nenvironment for students.  Rational basis review requires nothing \nmore. \nIII.  FINAL WORDS \nHere's where all of this leaves us. \nAs  this  opinion  has  endeavored  to  illuminate,  we \nacknowledge the fundamental importance of the rights asserted by \nthe Parents to be informed of, and to direct, significant aspects \nof their child's life -- including their socialization, education, \nand health.  Be that as it may -- as this opinion has also made \neffort to explicate -- parental rights are not unlimited.  Parents \nmay  not  invoke  the  Due  Process  Clause  to  create  a  preferred \neducational experience for their child in public school.  As per \nour  understanding  of  Supreme  Court  precedent,  our  pluralistic \nsociety assigns those curricular and administrative decisions to \nthe expertise of school officials, charged with the responsibility \nof educating children.  And the Protocol of nondisclosure as to a \nstudent's  at-school  gender  expression  without  the  student's \nconsent does not restrict parental rights in a way courts have \nrecognized as a violation of the guarantees of substantive due \nprocess. \nAll told, the Parents have failed to state a claim that \nLudlow's  Protocol  as  applied  to  their  family  violated  their \n- 45 - \n\nCase: 23-1069     Document: 00118249041     Page: 46      Date Filed: 02/18/2025      Entry ID: 6700937\n     \nconstitutional right to direct the upbringing of their child.  We \ntherefore  affirm  the  district  court's  grant  of  the  motion  to \ndismiss.23 \nCosts to appellees. \n \n23 Having affirmed the dismissal of the Parents' complaint on \nsubstantive grounds, we need not address whether the individual \ndefendants are entitled to qualified immunity. \n- 46 - ",

Defendants’  protocol  and  practice  of  concealing  from  parents \ninformation  related  to  their  children’s  gender  identity  and  efforts  to  affirm  a \ndiscordant student gender identity at school violates parents’ fundamental rights \nunder the United States and Massachusetts constitutions and violates children’s \nreciprocal rights to the care and custody of their parents, familial privacy, and \nintegrity. As to Plaintiffs Jonathan Feliciano and Sandra Salmeron, it also violates \n1 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-30041   Document 1   Filed 04/12/22   Page 3 of 58\ntheir fundamental right to free exercise of religion under the United States and \nMassachusetts constitutions.  \n3.  Plaintiffs Stephen Foote and Marissa Silvestri are seeking injunctive \nand declaratory relief and damages under 42 U.S.C. §1983 on behalf of themselves \nand their minor children, B.F. and G.F., for violation of their constitutional rights.  \nPlaintiffs  Jonathan  Feliciano  and  Sandra  Salmeron  are  seeking  injunctive  and \ndeclaratory  relief  and  damages  under  42  U.S.C.  §1983  for  violation  of  their \nconstitutional rights. Plaintiffs also seek costs and attorneys’ fees pursuant to 42 \nU.S.C. §1988.  \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n4.  This action is filed pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 seeking redress of \ninjuries suffered by Plaintiffs from deprivation, under color of state law, of rights \nsecured by the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, by the laws \nof the United States and the laws of Massachusetts. Jurisdiction is proper in this \nCourt pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1343(a). Jurisdiction is also proper under \n28 U.S.C. § 1332(a)(1) in that the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000 and is \nbetween citizens of different states.  \n5.  Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b) and other \napplicable law because the events and omissions giving rise to the claims in this \naction arose in the Town of Ludlow, Massachusetts which is situated within the \n2 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-30041   Document 1   Filed 04/12/22   Page 4 of 58\ndistrict and divisional boundaries of the Springfield Division of the U.S. District \nCourt for the District of Massachusetts. Venue is also proper in this Court because \nDefendants reside or have their principal place of business in this District. \n6.  This  Court  is  authorized  to  grant  declaratory  judgment  under  the \nDeclaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201-02, implemented through Federal \nRule of Civil Procedure 57, and to issue injunctive relief under Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 65. \n7.  An actual controversy exists between the parties involving substantial \nconstitutional issues, in that Plaintiffs allege that Defendants’ policies, procedures, \ndirectives and actions taken in accordance with them, on their face and as applied, \nviolate the United States Constitution and have infringed Plaintiffs’ rights, while \nDefendants  will  allege  that  their  policies,  procedures,  directives,  and  actions \ncomport with the Constitution and Massachusetts law.  \n8.  This Court is authorized to grant Plaintiffs’ prayer for relief regarding \ncosts, including a reasonable attorney’s fee, under 42 U.S.C. § 1988. \nPARTIES \n9.

Chapter 76, \n§5 was amended to include “gender identity” as a protected class:   \nNo person shall be excluded from or discriminated against in admission \nto  a  public  school  of  any  town,  or  in  obtaining  the  advantages, \n5 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-30041   Document 1   Filed 04/12/22   Page 7 of 58\nprivileges and courses of study of such public school on account of race, \ncolor,  sex,  gender  identity,  religion,  national  origin  or  sexual \norientation. \n22.   In June 2012, the Massachusetts Board of Elementary and Secondary \nEducation  (Board)  adopted  revised  Access  to  Equal  Education  Opportunity \nRegulations, 603 CMR 26.00 to reflect the broadened student anti-discrimination \nprovision in G.L. c. 76, §5.  \n23.  The Board also directed the Department of Elementary and Secondary \nEducation  (“DESE”)  to  provide  guidance  to  school  districts  to  assist  in \nimplementing the gender identity provision. \n24.  In response to the Board’s directive, DESE published “Guidance for \nMassachusetts Public Schools Creating a Safe and Supportive School Environment,” \n(“Guidance”) offering advice and suggestions for school policies and procedures to \naddress the changes in laws and regulations.  \n25.  The Guidance document has  not  been adopted  as a regulation nor \nenacted as a statute. \n26.  In the Guidance, DESE suggests that:  \nConsistent  with  the  statutory  standard,  a  school  should  accept  a \nstudent's assertion of his or her gender identity when there is \"consistent \nand  uniform  assertion  of  the  gender-related  identity,  or  any  other \nevidence that the gender-related identity is sincerely held as part of a \nperson's  core  identity.\"  If  a  student's  gender-related  identity, \nappearance, or behavior meets this standard, the only circumstance in \nwhich a school may question a student's asserted gender identity is \nwhere school personnel have a credible basis for believing that the \n6 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-30041   Document 1   Filed 04/12/22   Page 8 of 58\nstudent's gender-related identity is being asserted for some improper \npurpose. https://www.doe.mass.edu/sfs/lgbtq/ GenderIdentity.html 3/7 \n \n27.    The Guidance further suggests:  \nSome transgender and gender nonconforming students are not openly \nso at home for reasons such as safety concerns or lack of acceptance. \nSchool personnel should speak with the student first before discussing \na  student's  gender  nonconformity  or  transgender  status  with  the \nstudent’s parent or guardian. For the same reasons, school personnel \nshould discuss with the student how the school should refer to the \nstudent, e.g., appropriate pronoun use, in written communication to the \nstudent's parent or guardian. Id. \n \n28.   In the Guidance, DESE states that in the case of “young students” \nparents should be consulted regarding issues of disclosure of the students’ assertion \nof a discordant gender identity. Id. The Guidance does not define “young students.” \n29.  DESE’s Guidance also says:  \nTransgender and gender nonconforming students may decide to discuss \nand express their gender identity openly and may decide when, with \nwhom, and how much to share private information. A student who is \n14 years of age or older, or who has entered the ninth grade, may \nconsent to disclosure of information from his or her student record. If \na student is under 14 and is not yet in the ninth grade, the student’s \nparent (alone) has the authority to decide on disclosures and other \nstudent record matters.  \n \nId.  (emphasis  added)  (citing  Section  23.01  of  Title  603  of  the  Code  of \nMassachusetts Regulations (603 CMR§23.01).  \n30.   Information regarding a student’s sex, name change for gender identity \npurposes, gender transition, medical or mental health treatment related to gender \n7 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-30041   Document 1   Filed 04/12/22   Page 9 of 58\nidentity, or any other information of a similar nature, regardless of its form, is part \nof the individual's student record, subject to 603 CMR §23.01. \n31.  Pursuant to 603 CMR §23.01 consent to disclosure of information \nregarding  a  student’s  sex,  name  change  for  gender  identity  purposes,  gender \ntransition, and/or medical or mental health treatment related to gender identity lies \nwith parents alone until the student is in ninth grade or age 14, unless a local school \ncommittee has adopted an alternative policy. \n32.  Plaintiffs  are  informed  and  believe  and  based  thereon  allege  that \nLudlow Public Schools has not adopted a formal written policy superseding 603 \nCMR §23.01 to provide students under the age of 14 or below grade 9 with the sole \nauthority to give or withhold consent to disclosure of information regarding sex, \nname change for gender identity purposes, gender transition or medical or mental \nhealth treatment related to gender identity. \n33.   Plaintiffs  are  informed  and  believe  and  based  thereon  allege  that \nDefendant School Committee has interpreted the DESE Guidance statements that \nSchool personnel should speak with the student first before discussing \na  student's  gender  nonconformity  or  transgender  status  with  the \nstudent’s parent or guardian. For the same reasons, school personnel \nshould discuss with the student how the school should refer to the \nstudent, e.g., appropriate pronoun use, in written communication to the \nstudent's parent or guardian. \n \n8 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-30041   Document 1   Filed 04/12/22   Page 10 of 58\nto mean that school personnel are prohibited from notifying the parents of a student \nof any age about their child’s gender nonconformity or transgender status unless the \nstudent consents to his or her parents being notified. Plaintiffs are informed and \nbelieve and based thereon allege that Defendant School Committee has approved \nand instructed district administrators to implement a protocol that school personnel \ncannot discuss a child’s gender nonconformity or transgender status with the child’s \nparents unless the child consents (the “Protocol”). \n34.   Plaintiffs are informed and believe and based thereon allege that until \nJuly  2021  Defendant  Gazda  as  Superintendent  of  Ludlow  Public  Schools \nimplemented  the  Protocol  throughout  Ludlow  Public  Schools  and  directed \nadministrators, teachers, counselors and other staff at all schools to adhere to the \nProtocol by not notifying parents regarding their child’s gender nonconformity or \ntransgender status unless the child had consented to his or her parents being notified.  \n35.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe and based thereon allege that from \nJuly 2021 to the present Defendant Nemeth, as Interim Superintendent of Ludlow \nPublic Schools, has implemented the Protocol throughout Ludlow Public Schools \nand directed administrators, teachers, counselors and other staff in all district schools \nto adhere to the Protocol by not notifying parents regarding their child’s gender \nnonconformity or transgender status unless the child had consented to his or her \nparents being notified. \n9 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-30041   Document 1   Filed 04/12/22   Page 11 of 58\n36.  Because the Protocol continues to be implemented in all schools in \nLudlow Public Schools, Plaintiffs Feliciano’s and Salmeron’s children are included \nin and subject to the Protocol.  \n37.  Therefore, information regarding the Feliciano and Salmeron children’s \ngender  nonconformity  or  transgender  status  would  be,  or  presently  is  being, \nconcealed from them if the children have raised, or do raise, those issues with \nDistrict staff.  \n38.  Plaintiffs  are  informed  and  believe  and  based  thereon  allege  that \nDefendant  Monette  as  Principal  of  Baird  Middle  School  has  implemented  the \nProtocol at Baird Middle School and directed administrators, teachers, counselors, \nincluding  Defendant  Marie-Claire  Foley,  librarians  including  until  May  2021 \nDefendant Jordan Funke, and other staff to adhere to the Policy by not notifying \nparents regarding their child’s gender nonconformity or transgender identification \nunless the child consented to his or her parents being notified. \n39.  On  or  about  September  2019,  Defendant  Jordan  Funke  instructed \nincoming sixth grade students at Baird Middle School to create videos and to include \nin the videos their gender identity and preferred pronouns. Plaintiffs Foote’s and \nSilvestri’s 11-year-old daughter, B.F. was among the students given that assignment. \nThe videos of their children were created without the parents’ knowledge or consent \n10 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-30041   Document 1   Filed 04/12/22   Page 12 of 58\nand it remains unknown how these videos were used or who was allowed to view \nthem. \n40.  Plaintiffs  are  informed  and  believe  and  based  thereon  allege  that \nDefendant Funke had previously given the assignment to incoming sixth graders, \nincluding Plaintiffs Foote’s and Silvestri’s son G.F., but since parents were not \nnotified about the assignment, there was no way for Plaintiffs or other parents to \nknow.  \n41.  Plaintiffs Foote and Silvestri learned of the video assignment and of \ntheir daughter’s and son’s participation in it only after other parents had learned after \nthe fact that their children had participated.  \n42.  Plaintiffs Foote and Silvestri notified administrators at Baird Middle \nSchool and stated that they objected to Defendant Funke’s actions. They were told \nthat the assignment would not be repeated without parental notice and consent. \n43.  On  or  about  December  14,  2020,  B.F.  an  11-year-old  sixth  grade \nstudent at Baird Middle School, asked to meet with her teacher Bonnie Manchester \nvirtually after school to discuss some issues.  \n44.  On December 15, 2020, B.F. met virtually with Ms. Manchester and \ntold her that she was experiencing insecurity, low self-esteem, poor self-image, and \na perceived lack of popularity. B.F. said that she had told a friend that she likes girls \n11 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-30041   Document 1   Filed 04/12/22   Page 13 of 58\nand that she had been watching YouTube videos which presented the message that \nshe was “born that way.”  \n45.  B.F. told Ms. Manchester that she was depressed and needed help but \nwas not sure how to ask her parents about getting help. Ms. Manchester offered to \ncall B.F.’s parents and B.F. agreed. B.F. told Ms. Manchester that she was relieved \nand grateful that Ms. Manchester was calling her parents because B.F. was unsure \nhow to broach the subject.  \n46.  On December 16, 2020 during a planning meeting, Ms. Manchester and \nother teachers said that they had observed that B.F. seemed to be depressed and that \nB.F.’s parents should be contacted. Ms. Manchester agreed to contact them since she \nhad already discussed doing so with B.F.  \n47.  On December 17, 2020, Ms. Manchester contacted Mrs. Silvestri and \ninformed  her  of  the  conversation  with  B.F.  and  concerns  about  B.F.  feeling \ndepressed. Ms. Manchester also told Mrs. Silverstri that B.F. had said that she might \nbe attracted to the same sex and was having issues with self-image. Mrs. Silverstri \nresponded that she had recently observed that there was something troubling B.F. \nand was grateful that Ms. Manchester had contacted her.  \n48.  During the December 17, 2020 conversation, Ms. Manchester and Mrs. \nSilvestri agreed to work together to help B.F. Mrs. Silvestri and Mr. Foote would \n12 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-30041   Document 1   Filed 04/12/22   Page 14 of 58\nschedule  therapy for B.F. and Ms. Manchester would  work with B.F. on craft \nactivities after school.  \n49.  Mrs. Silvestri and Mr. Foote retained a therapist to work with B.F. soon \nafter the call with Ms. Manchester. \n50.  On December 21, 2020, Mrs. Silvestri sent the following email to B.F.’s \nteachers, Defendant Monette, Defendant Gazda, and the members of Defendant \nSchool Committee:  \nIt has been brought to the attention of both Stephen and myself that \nsome of B’s teachers are concerned with her mental health. I appreciate \nyour concern and would like to let you know that her father and I will \nbe getting her the professional help she needs at this time. With that \nbeing said, we request that you do not have any private conversations \nwith B. in regards to this matter. Please allow us to address this as a \nfamily and with the proper professionals.  \n \n51.  Plaintiffs  Foote  and  Silvestri  are  informed  and  believe  and  based \nthereon  allege  that  Defendants  Gazda  and  Monette  and  Baird  Middle  School \nteachers  who  had  received  the  email  disregarded  the  parents’  instructions  and \nDefendants Gazda and Monette failed to direct that Baird Middle School staff should \ncomply with Plaintiffs’ instructions regarding their 11-year-old daughter’s mental \nhealth care.  \n52.  Plaintiffs  Foote  and  Silvestri  are  informed  and  believe  and  based \nthereon  allege  that  prior  to  June  2021  Defendant  Gazda  and  since  June  2021 \nDefendant Nemeth along with Defendant Monette and Baird Middle School teachers \n13 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-30041   Document 1   Filed 04/12/22   Page 15 of 58\nwho  had  received  the  email  have  and  are  continuing  to  disregard  the  parents’ \ninstructions, as B.F. has changed her preferred name at least twice since December \n2020 without Plaintiffs’ knowledge or consent, and to this date they continue to \naddress  B.F.  by  whatever  iteration  of  her  name  she  has  indicated  she  prefers. \nTeachers  at  Baird  Middle  School  have  revealed  that  they  are  disregarding  the \nparents’  instructions  by  sending  email  communications  related  to  school \nassignments for B.F., but referencing a child with a first name other than “B.”  \n53.  In reckless disregard of Plaintiffs Foote’s and Silvestri’s parental rights \nto make mental health decisions for their children and in direct contravention to their \nexplicit instructions, Baird Middle School staff, and in particular Defendant Foley, \nhave engaged in regular communications with B.F. in which B.F. talked about \nhaving a discordant gender identity and requested to be called by a male name, “R,” \nand affirming the discordant identity and name.  \n54.  Said Baird Middle School staff did not notify Plaintiffs Foote  and \nSilvestri of these conversations, but instead followed the Protocol to conceal this \ninformation from B.F.’s parents.  \n55.  Plaintiffs  Foote  and  Silvestri  are  informed  and  believe  and  based \nthereon allege that Defendants Gazda and Monette and Ludlow Public Schools, \nincluding Baird Middle School, teachers and counselors similarly disregarded the \nparents’ intent regarding their son G.F. by engaging in regular conversations with \n14 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-30041   Document 1   Filed 04/12/22   Page 16 of 58\nG.F., who had identified as transgender and requested to be called by a female name \n“S.,” in which they affirmed the discordant identity and alternate name. Said Baird \nMiddle  School  staff  did  not  notify  Plaintiffs  Foote  and  Silvestri  of  these \nconversations, but instead followed the Protocol to conceal the information from \nthem as they have for B.F.  \n56.  On February 28, 2021, B.F. sent the following email to Defendant \nFoley,  Defendant  Gazda,  and  teachers  at  Baird  Middle  School,  including  Ms. \nManchester:  \nHello everyone, If you are reading this you are either my teacher or \nguidance counselor. I have an announcement to make and I trust you \nguys with this information. I am genderqueer. Basically, it means I use \nany pronouns (other than it/its). This also means I have a name change. \nMy new name will be R****.  Please call me by that name. If you \ndeadname me or use any pronouns I am not comfortable with I will \npolitely tell you. I am telling you this because I feel like I can trust you. \nA  list  of  pronouns  you  can  use  are:  she/her  he/him  they/them \nfae/faerae/aer  ve/ver xe/xem ze/zir. I have added a link so you can look \nat how to say them. Please only use the ones I have listed and not the \nother ones. I do not like them. Thank you. R*** Foote.  \n \n57.  Plaintiffs  Foote  and  Silvestri  are  informed  and  believe  and  based \nthereon allege that on March 1, 2021, Defendant Foley sent a “reply all” email to \nB.F. and the other recipients of B.F.’s February 28, 2021 email saying that B.F.’s \nparents  were  not  to  be  notified.  In  particular,  Defendant  Foley  wrote:  “R**** \n[B****] is still in the process of telling his parents and is requesting that school staff \nrefer to him as B**** and use she/her pronouns with her parents and in written \n15 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-30041   Document 1   Filed 04/12/22   Page 17 of 58\nemails/letters home.” In so doing, Defendant Foley was directing Baird Middle \nSchool staff to deceive Plaintiffs Foote and Silvestri by actively concealing the fact \nthat school staff were affirming an alternative name and identity for their daughter.   \n58.  Plaintiffs  Foote  and  Silvestri  are  informed  and  believe  and  based \nthereon  allege  that  on  March  1,  2021  some  teachers  at  Baird  Middle  School \nimmediately began to refer to B.F. as “R” and to change name tags to reflect that \nname, without notifying B.F.’s parents.  \n59.  Plaintiffs  Foote  and  Silvestri  are  informed  and  believe  and  based \nthereon allege that on or about March 1, 2021, Defendant Foley referred B.F. to \nDefendant  Funke.  Defendant  Funke  had  publicly  told  members  of  the  school \ncommunity that she was “nonbinary,” directed students to use “nonbinary” pronouns \nand other labels for each other, and regularly met with students one-on-one to discuss \ngender identity issues, provide resources promoting exploration of alternate gender \nidentities, and otherwise encourage children to experiment with alternate gender \nidentities without notifying parents or obtaining parental consent.  \n60.  On or about March 1, 2021, Mr. Foote and Mrs. Silvestri were sent a \ncopy of B.F.’s email by Ms. Manchester.  \n61.  Plaintiffs  Foote  and  Silvestri  are  informed  and  believe  and  based \nthereon allege that on March 8, 2021, Defendant Foley sent an email to the entire \n16 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-30041   Document 1   Filed 04/12/22   Page 18 of 58\nstaff at Baird Middle School informing staff members of B.F.’s request to be called \n“R***” and that her parents were not to be told. \n62.  Plaintiffs  Foote  and  Silvestri  are  informed  and  believe  and  based \nthereon allege that on and before March 4, 2021 G.F.’s teachers at Baird Middle \nSchool were complying with G.F.’s request to be called by a preferred alternate name \nwithout the knowledge or consent of Mr. Foote and Mrs. Silvestri.  \n63.  Plaintiffs  Foote  and  Silvestri  are  informed  and  believe  and  based \nthereon allege that on March 10, 2021 during a planning meeting, Ms. Manchester \nand other Baird Middle School teachers discussed B.F.’s email and discussed that \nthey were calling B.F.’s brother G.F. by his preferred name “S.” \n64.  Plaintiffs  Foote  and  Silvestri  are  informed  and  believe  and  based \nthereon allege that during the planning meeting on March 10, 2021 Defendant Foley \ntold the teachers present that the law says that school staff do not have to tell parents \nabout their children’s requests to change their name or otherwise socially affirm a \nstudent’s asserted transgender identity.  \n65.  Plaintiffs  Foote  and  Silvestri  are  informed  and  believe  and  based \nthereon allege that on March 11, 2021, Defendant Foley, without notification to or \nconsent from Mr. Foote or Mrs. Silvestri, initiated a conversation with B.F. through \nan online chat inquiring about her well-being. Defendant Foley also informed B.F. \nthat she could use any bathroom that she felt comfortable with, including the boys’ \n17 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-30041   Document 1   Filed 04/12/22   Page 19 of 58\nbathroom, girls’ bathroom, or one of three gender neutral bathrooms at the school. \nDefendant Foley offered to show B.F. where the gender neutral bathrooms were \nlocated.  \n66.  Therefore, as of March 11, 2021, Mr. Foote’s and Mrs. Silvestri’s 11-\nyear-old daughter was being told that she could use the boys’ privacy facilities at \nschool, where she would be exposed to middle school boys in various states of \nundress and vice-versa, without Mr. Foote and Mrs. Silvestri being informed or \nconsenting to same.  \n67.  Plaintiffs  Foote  and  Silvestri  are  informed  and  believe  and  based \nthereon allege that on March 11, 2021, Defendant Foley told B.F. in an online chat \nthat B.F. was “brave and awesome” for telling her teachers and guidance counselor \nthat she was “genderqueer” and wanted to be referred to by the name “R.” \n68.  On March 18, 2021, Plaintiffs Foote and Silvestri met virtually with \nDefendant Monette to discuss the Defendants’ disregard of the Plaintiffs’ parental \nrights and, in particular, of the Plaintiffs’ specific instructions that school staff not \nengage with their children regarding mental health issues which Mr. Foote and Mrs. \nSilvestri had told school officials that they were dealing with as a family with the \nhelp of a mental health professional, in keeping with their fundamental parental \nrights to direct the mental health care of their children. \n18 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-30041   Document 1   Filed 04/12/22   Page 20 of 58\n69.  Mr. Foote and Mrs. Silvestri attempted to discuss the issues related to \ntheir children with Defendant Monette and to convey that Defendants were acting \nimproperly and illegally in disregarding their parental rights and failing to notify \nthem regarding their children’s assertion of discordant gender identities and names.  \n70.  Defendant Monette failed to discuss the issues with Mr. Foote and Mrs. \nSilvestri, but ended the meeting after 10 minutes and after intimating that the school \nknew better than the parents what was best for B.F. and G.F. with regard to the \ngender identity issue. \n71.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe and based thereon allege that on the \nday after the meeting with Mr. Foote and Mrs. Silvestri, March 19, 2021, Defendant \nMonette notified Ms. Manchester that she was being placed on administrative leave \neffective  immediately  for  “conduct  unbecoming  a  teacher  relating  to  your \ninappropriate contact with the parents of a student,” i.e., forwarding a student’s email \nto the student’s own parents.  \n72.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe and based thereon allege that on \nMarch 25, 2021, Defendant Monette and Ludlow Public Schools’ legal compliance \nofficer Rebecca Bouchard met with Ms. Manchester and questioned her about her \nconversations with Mr. Foote and Mrs. Silvestri regarding the email sent by B.F. \nregarding her discordant gender identity and request to be called by a male name.  \n19 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-30041   Document 1   Filed 04/12/22   Page 21 of 58\n73.  On March 21, 2021, Mrs. Silvestri sent a follow up email to Defendant \nGazda informing him that Mr. Foote’s and her concerns about the school’s conduct \nwere not about their attitudes about sex and gender nor any disappointment or \n“embarrassment” on their part regarding those issues. Instead, Mrs. Silvestri and Mr. \nFoote  were  concerned  about  the  fact  that  their  rights  as  parents  were  being \ndisregarded by school officials. Mrs. Silvestri said that their children telling teachers \nand fellow students “that they want to be called by a different name (of the opposite \nsex) is something that will follow the children through school and not be forgotten \nby classmates.” Mrs. Silvestri stated that such a decision with long-term effects is \nsomething that parents should be the primary source of help and guidance to navigate \ntheir children through. She further stated that the fact that Mrs. Silvestri and Mr. \nFoote were not permitted to be involved in that decision because of school officials’ \nconcealment was unacceptable.  \n74.  In the March 21, 2021 email, Mrs. Silvestri reminded Defendant Gazda \nthat  no  one  to  whom  their  original  December  20,  2020  email  was  addressed \nacknowledged receipt or responded. Instead, the parents were ignored by teachers, \nguidance counselors, Defendant  Gazda and the School  Committee, who  utterly \ndisregarded the parents’ explicit instructions to not engage in conversations with \ntheir children related to their mental health and to permit the parents to exercise their \nprimary authority to oversee their children’s mental health care. \n20 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-30041   Document 1   Filed 04/12/22   Page 22 of 58\n75.  On March 22, 2021, Defendant Gazda replied via email in which he \nacknowledged that neither he nor anyone from the school committee responded to \nthe parents’ December 20, 2020 email. He asserted that Defendant Foley “acted \nappropriately” in not notifying B.F.’s parents when B.F. sent the February 28, 2021 \nemail to Baird Middle School teachers and Defendant Foley. Defendant Gazda stated \nthat Defendant Foley was “properly implementing” the DESE Guidance’s statement \nthat  “School  personnel  should  speak  with  the  student  first  before  discussing  a \nstudent's gender nonconformity or transgender status with the student's parent or \nguardian.” He also stated Defendant Foley “properly implemented” the statement \nthat “school personnel should discuss with the student how the school should refer \nto  the  student,  e.g.,  appropriate  pronoun  use,  in  written  communication  to  the \nstudent's  parent  or  guardian.\"  Implicit  in  Defendant  Gazda’s  statement  was \nDefendants’ understanding, as implemented through the Protocol, that the DESE \nGuidance statement about speaking to a student before speaking to parents means \nnot speaking to the parents at all if the student (a minor child under age 14) objects.  \n76.  Defendant Gazda further quoted the Guidance’s reference to 603 CMR \n§23.01 that  \nTransgender and gender nonconforming students may decide to discuss \nand express their gender identity openly and may decide when, with \nwhom, and how much to share private information. A student who is \n14 years of age or older, or who has entered the ninth grade, may \nconsent to disclosure of information from his or her student record. If a \nstudent is under 14 and is not yet in the ninth grade, the student's parent \n21 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-30041   Document 1   Filed 04/12/22   Page 23 of 58\n(alone) has the authority to decide on disclosures and other student \nrecord matters. \n \nDefendant Gazda did not state that Ludlow Public Schools had adopted a policy \nwhich amended the age of consent to less than 14 years, and Plaintiffs are informed \nand believe that no such policy has been enacted. However, Mr. Gazda claimed that, \neven though B.F. was below age 14, Defendants did not violate 603 CMR §23.01 \nbecause no “disclosure” was made. Defendant Gazda also did not state how 603 \nCMR §23.01 would appropriately operate against the minor student’s own parents. \n77.  On March 26, 2021, Mr. Foote and Mrs. Silvestri met virtually with \nDefendant Gazda and Ms. Bouchard to further discuss the Defendants’ disregard of \ntheir parental rights. Defendant Gazda and Ms. Bouchard repeated many of the same \nstatements made by Defendant Monette during the March 18, 2021 meeting. Ms. \nBouchard reiterated the claim that the District’s Protocol of concealing from parents \nwhen their children of any age raise issues related to a discordant gender identity is \nin line with the DESE Guidance.  \n78.  At the March 26, 2021 meeting, Mr. Foote and Mrs. Silvestri again \ndemanded  that  school  staff  not  talk  to  their  children  about  discordant  gender \nidentities and that school staff use the children’s proper names. Defendant Gazda \nand Ms. Bouchard would not respond.  \n79.  Meanwhile, Defendant Foley and other staff members at Baird Middle \nSchool  continued  to  knowingly  and  recklessly  disregard  Mr.  Foote’s  and  Mrs. \n22 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-30041   Document 1   Filed 04/12/22   Page 24 of 58\nSilvestri’s explicit instructions not to engage with their children regarding alternative \ngenders, preferred names, and mental health issues by surreptitiously setting up \nregular meetings to discuss B.F.’s assertion of a discordant gender identity without \nthe knowledge of her parents.  \n80.  On March 25, 2021, after Mr. Foote and Mrs. Silverstri had met with \nDefendant Monette and repeated their request that Baird Middle School staff cease \ntalking with their children regarding gender issues, Defendant Foley encouraged \nB.F. to meet with Defendant Foley via a weekly online meeting to discuss her gender \nissues and mental health.  \n81.  On March 30, 2021, Defendant Foley told B.F. that she was worried \nabout B.F. based upon a conversation Defendant Foley had with B.F. the day before. \nDefendant Foley said that she wanted B.F. to speak to another counselor. She said, \n“I can't be the only person that you talk to because we don't have enough time \ntogether and I can’t be there to keep you safe,” thereby planting or nurturing in B.F. \nthe thought that her parents were not “safe.”  \n82.  Despite claiming to be concerned about B.F.’s safety, Defendant Foley \ndid not contact B.F.’s parents to share her concerns about their child’s safety.  \n83.  When B.F. informed Defendant Foley that she was seeing a counselor \nthat  her  parents  had  chosen,  Defendant  Foley  questioned  whether  B.F.  was \ncomfortable discussing issues with that counselor as she was discussing issues with \n23 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-30041   Document 1   Filed 04/12/22   Page 25 of 58\nDefendant  Foley,  thereby  intimating  that  B.F.’s  parents’  choice  might  not  be \nappropriate. Defendant Foley further stated that she believed that B.F. needed to get \nhelp and support, intimating that B.F. was not receiving appropriate help and support \nfrom her parents. In so doing, Defendant Foley was interfering with Plaintiffs’ \nexercise of their right to direct B.F.’s mental health care as well as the parent-child \nrelationship.  \n84.   Defendant Foley continued to interfere with Plaintiffs’ exercise of their \nright to direct mental health care for B.F. and to question whether B.F.’s parents \nwere providing B.F. with appropriate care in online chats in which she asked B.F. \nwhether the counselor chosen by her parents was providing adequate care, and in \nstating that she was “behind” B.F., implying that B.F. needed further or different \ncare  than was being offered by her parents.   \n85.  On April 7, 2021, Defendant Foley again interfered with Plaintiffs’ \nexercise  of  their  mental  health  decision-making  in  questioning  whether  B.F.’s \nparents were properly caring for B.F. in an online chat in which Defendant Foley \nasked  B.F.  whether  B.F.  could  keep  herself  safe  when  she  was  feeling  down. \nDefendant Foley further implied that B.F.’s parents were not providing appropriate \ncare by telling B.F. that she was “there” for B.F., insinuating that B.F.’s parents were \nnot able to keep her safe or provide proper care.  \n24 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-30041   Document 1   Filed 04/12/22   Page 26 of 58\n86.  Throughout  April  and  May  2021,  Defendant  Foley  continued  to \nsurreptitiously  correspond  with  B.F.  via  online  chats  and  text  messages  and \ncontinued to affirm and applaud B.F.’s assertion of alternate genders and alternate \nnames, intentionally disregarding B.F.’s parents’ rights to direct their daughter’s \nmental health care and their explicit instructions that Baird Middle School staff was \nnot to engage in such conversations with their children.  \n87.  On April 23, 2021, Mr. Foote received a card in the mail addressed to \n“R Foote,” congratulating “R. Foote,” Mr. Foote’s daughter B.F., for winning a \nbumper sticker contest put on by one of her teachers. The teacher enclosed an \nAmazon  Gift  Card  with  “Congratulations  R”  written  on  it,  demonstrating \nDefendants’  continuing  adherence  to  the  Protocol  and  blatant  disregard  for \nPlaintiffs’ parental rights.  \n88.  Defendants’ continued implementation of the Protocol and disregard \nfor  parental  rights  is  further  evidenced  by  Defendant  Monette’s  actions  in \nterminating the employment of Ms. Manchester because Ms. Manchester respected \nthe rights of B.F.’s parents by forwarding them information regarding their 11-year-\nold daughter’s depression and low self-esteem, assertion of a discordant gender \nidentity, and request to be referred to by a male name. \n89.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe and based thereon allege that on \nApril  16,  2021  Defendant  Monette  informed  Ms.  Manchester  that  she  was \n25 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-30041   Document 1   Filed 04/12/22   Page 27 of 58\nterminating  Ms.  Manchester’s  employment  because  forwarding  an  11-year-old \nchild’s email regarding assertion of a discordant gender identity and request to use \na male name, according to Ms. Monette, violated state and federal privacy laws, \nDESE guidelines, and contradicted the wishes of Plaintiffs Foote’s and Silvestri’s \n11-year-old daughter. Defendant Monette did not explain how forwarding an 11-\nyear-old child’s email to her parents violated guidelines that said that parents have \nsole authority over disclosure of children’s personal information until the child \nreaches age 14 or ninth grade.  \n90.  Plaintiffs  Foote  and  Silvestri  are  informed  and  believe  and  based \nthereon allege that Defendant Funke met one on one with G.F., as well as with B.F., \non multiple occasions to discuss alternative genders, affirm the children’s choices of \nalternative names, and provide encouragement for their assertion of a transgender \nidentity, all without informing their parents or obtaining parental consent. \n91.  Plaintiffs  are  informed  and  believe  and  based  thereon  allege  that \nDefendant Funke instructed children not to use the terms “boys” and “girls,” but to \nuse alternative terms rooted in gender identity ideology, which were posted on the \nwalls  of  the  library  and  circulated  to  students  as  a  handout.  Parents  were  not \ninformed of  Defendant  Funke’s efforts to compel students  to speak falsely [in \naccordance with the ideology being promoted by Defendant Funke] and to conceal \ninformation from their parents.  \n26 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-30041   Document 1   Filed 04/12/22   Page 28 of 58\n92.  Defendants’  conduct  in  encouraging  young  students  to  conceal \ninformation from their parents and undermining parental authority explicitly and \nimplicitly by planting seeds of doubt in the children’s minds violates Plaintiffs’ \nfundamental parental rights to direct the upbringing of their children, make mental \nhealth decisions for their children and protect family integrity and privacy. As to \nPlaintiffs  Feliciano  and  Salmeron,  Defendants’  conduct  also  infringes  on  their \nsincerely  held  religious  beliefs  which  include  respect  for  parental  authority, \ntruthfulness, and adherence to a Biblical understanding of male and female and \nstandards of behavior.  \n93.  Plaintiffs  Foote  and  Silvestri  are  informed  and  believe  and  based \nthereon allege that at least between December 2020 and May 2021, and perhaps \ncontinuing through the present (since the Protocol requires secrecy), Ludlow Public \nSchool staff applied and perhaps is still applying the Protocol in interactions with \nG.F., as well as continuing to apply the Protocol to interactions with B.F.   Ludlow \nPublic Schools staff continued to endorse an alternative female identity for G.F. with \na  new  female  name  and  pronouns  when  G.F.  was  at  school,  or  in  personal \ncorrespondence with  G.F., and concealed this  significant information from Mr. \nFoote and Mrs. Silvestri despite the parents’ explicit direction that school staff were \nnot to engage in conversations with their children regarding gender issues.  \n27 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-30041   Document 1   Filed 04/12/22   Page 29 of 58\n94.  In so doing, Defendants and other staff in Ludlow Public Schools acting \nunder the authority and direction of Defendants Gazda, Nemeth, Monette, and the \nSchool Committee have intentionally acted in reckless disregard of Mr. Foote’s and \nMrs. Silvestri’s rights to direct the mental health care of their children and in direct \ncontravention of their explicit instructions to Defendant Gazda, Defendant Monette, \nthe School Committee, and other Ludlow Public Schools staff.  \n95.  Furthermore, Plaintiffs Feliciano’s and Salmeron’s children may have \nalready been subject to the protocol and remain at risk of being subjected to the \nProtocol so long as Defendants continue to implement it and recklessly disregard \nPlaintiffs’ rights to direct the upbringing of their children and to direct the mental \nhealth  care  of  their  children.  Because  the  intent  of  the  Protocol  is  to  conceal \ninformation  from  parents,  Plaintiffs  Feliciano  and  Salmeron  are  deliberately \nhindered from ascertaining whether their children are being secretly counseled about \nand affirmed in discordant gender identities without their knowledge or consent.  \n96.  Defendants School Committee, Nemeth, and Monette are continuing to \nimplement the Protocol to conceal information from parents when children of any \nage raise issues related to gender non-conformity or transgender status in direct \ncontravention of Plaintiffs’ parental rights as set forth more fully infra. Defendants’ \nzeal to implement the Protocol and conceal information from parents was manifested \nin terminating the employment of a teacher who dared to inform the parents of an \n28 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-30041   Document 1   Filed 04/12/22   Page 30 of 58\n11-year-old child that their child was experiencing depression, asserting a discordant \ngender identity, and requesting to use an assumed male name.  \n97.  Defendant School Committee has explicitly approved the institution \nand continuing implementation of the Protocol and the intentional concealment of \ninformation from parents.  \n98.  On May 25, 2021 during a School Committee public meeting, a tenth \ngrade student in Ludlow Public Schools submitted a public comment via email, \nwhich was the only vehicle that the School Committee provided for the public \nmeeting that was held in an empty meeting room. In that comment, the writer \nconfirmed what Plaintiffs had been experiencing, i.e., Defendants’ disregard for \nparental rights.  \n99.  In the email read aloud during the meeting, the writer said that staff \nmembers were pushing extreme ideas to children 11 to 14 years old as part of an \nagenda aimed at “trying to convince children to change who they are and change \ntheir sexuality and gender at an age that many of them do not yet fully understand \nthe concepts of sexuality and gender.” The writer further stated that the School \nCommittee and staff were ignoring parents’ rights.  \n100.  After the email was read, Defendant Gazda read a prepared rebuttal. \nDefendant Gazda did not dispute what was said about District actions. Instead, \nDefendant  Gazda  stated  that  the  District’s  actions  were  about  “inclusion”  and \n29 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-30041   Document 1   Filed 04/12/22   Page 31 of 58\nmaking schools “safe” for children. He said the District’s actions “help children” to \n“be free to be themselves.” Defendant Gazda said that instead of discontinuing their \nactions the District needed to do more to protect LGBTQ children.  \n101.  Defendant  Gazda  also  stated  publicly  what  he  had  told  Plaintiffs \nprivately, i.e., that the District’s actions (e.g., the Protocol) are “in compliance” with \nthe laws and regulations of Massachusetts and DESE Guidance.  \n102.  Defendant Gazda further stated publicly, without refutation from the \nSchool Committee, that parents’ concerns amounted to “intolerance of LGBTQ \npeople thinly veiled” behind a “camouflage of parental rights.” Defendant Gazda \nfurther stated that schools, not homes, are the true “safe space” for children because \nschools supply “caring adults” where students can discuss problems and find support \nfor their “true identities,” implying that children do not receive such care from their \nparents. He said, “For many students school is their only safe place, and that safety \nevaporates when they leave the confines of our buildings,” insinuating that safety is \nnot to be found in their homes. Gazda said that the middle school will absolutely \ncontinue to help the children “express who they are” despite parents’ wishes to the \ncontrary. \n103.  Defendant  School  Committee  has  condoned  and  facilitated  the \ncontinued implementation of the  Protocol, and in particular the  intentional and \nblatant disregard for parental rights reflected in concealing information from parents \n30 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-30041   Document 1   Filed 04/12/22   Page 32 of 58\nregarding their children’s gender non-conformity or transgender identification and \nin actively deceiving parents by directing staff to use children’s given names and \npronouns when speaking with parents but using the child’s asserted preference for \nalternative names and pronouns at all other times.  \n104.  Defendant School Committee has evidenced that it has adopted the \nProtocol as a de facto policy in public statements, including those at the June 8, 2021 \npublic meeting. After an email public comment from a group of parents was read \nduring the meeting, Committee Chairman Michael  Kelliher repeated Defendant \nGazda’s claim that the District’s actions were “in compliance” with state and federal \nlaws. Mr. Kelliher defended the actions of district staff as “simply doing their jobs” \nof  “being  welcoming  and  supporting  to  the  children.”  Expressing  disdain  and \ndisregard for the rights of Ludlow Public School parents, he said that parents who \nwere making their concerns known to the Committee were opposing “inclusive \npolicies of the Ludlow Public Schools” and were “under the spell” of “outside \ngroups.”  \n105.  At  the  June  8,  2021  Committee  meeting  Defendant  Gazda  further \nevidenced Defendants’ disdain and disregard for parental rights by characterizing \nparents’ concerns about not being notified and their decisions not being honored \nregarding their children’s gender identity issues as “prejudice and bigotry.”   \n31 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-30041   Document 1   Filed 04/12/22   Page 33 of 58\n106.  Committee  members  did  not  disagree  with  nor  correct  Defendant \nGazda’s public statements or otherwise refute that the District’s accepted Protocol, \ni.e. de facto policy, was to conceal critical information regarding their children’s \nmental health from parents and to disregard parents’ instructions regarding their \nchildren’s assertion of a discordant gender identity.  \n107.  As parents of children who attend Ludlow Public Schools, all of the \nPlaintiffs  are  subjects  of  Defendants’  Protocol,  disdain,  and  attendant  reckless \ndisregard for their fundamental rights. So long as the Protocol remains in effect and \nis being implemented by Defendants, Plaintiffs continue to suffer deprivation of their \nfundamental parental rights to direct the upbringing of their children and particularly \nto direct the mental health care of their children.  \n108.  So long as the Protocol remains in place, Plaintiffs’ children can be, or \nmay  already  be,  subject  to  surreptitious  meetings,  conversations,  counseling \nsessions, online chats, and other communications with Ludlow Public Schools staff \nregarding gender non-conformity and transgender issues without the knowledge or \nconsent  of  their  parents.  Furthermore,  Plaintiffs’  parental  rights  continue  to  be \nthreatened by the Protocol’s instructions that parents are to be deliberately deceived \nby staff who are directed to use their child’s legal name and pronouns corresponding \nto their sex when speaking with parents, but children’s preferred alternative names \nand pronouns at all other times in school-related communications.  \n32 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-30041   Document 1   Filed 04/12/22   Page 34 of 58\n109.  The  continuing  existence  and  implementation  of  the  Protocol  also \ninfringes on Plaintiffs Feliciano’s and Salmeron’s rights to free exercise of religion \nin that their sincerely held religious beliefs require truthfulness in speech, obedience \nto parents, and that their children’s identities as being created male or female be \nrespected regardless of contrary personal beliefs of school staff members.  \n110.  Defendants’ Protocol that affirms children’s desires to be called by an \nalternate gender discordant name and pronouns and actively promotes the idea that \nthey can socially transition to another gender involves significant mental health \ndecisions affecting children’s well-being with potentially life-long consequences. \nUnder  the  Protocol,  these  decisions  are being  made  without  the  knowledge  or \nconsent of parents. \n111.  Defendants  have  acted  with  reckless  disregard  for  the  rights  of \nPlaintiffs Foote and Silvestri as the parents of B.F. and G.F. and substituted their \njudgment for that of the parents in providing unauthorized mental health counseling \nand intervention without the knowledge or consent of B.F.’s and G.F.’s fit parents.  \nDefendants have intentionally and purposefully driven a wedge between Plaintiffs \nand their children, fostered distrust of parents, planted seeds of doubt that the parents \ncan  appropriately  care  for  their  children  and  keep  them  safe,  and  otherwise \nirreparably harmed the parent-child relationship.  \n33 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-30041   Document 1   Filed 04/12/22   Page 35 of 58\n112.  Defendants  have  acted  with  reckless  disregard  for  the  rights  of \nPlaintiffs Feliciano and Salmeron and other parents of children in Ludlow Public \nSchools. In adopting and continuing to implement the Protocol, Defendants have \nsubstituted, and continue to substitute, their judgment for that of the parents in \ndirecting the upbringing and mental health care for the children of Ludlow Public \nSchools. Defendants’ actions and public statements evidence a reckless disregard \nand disdain for the fundamental rights of Plaintiffs and other parents in Ludlow \nPublic Schools regarding decision-making related to children’s assertion of a gender \nidentity  in  conflict  with  their  sex  and  gender  non-conformity.  Defendants  are \nintentionally and purposefully driving a wedge between Plaintiffs and their children, \nfostering distrust of parents, planting seeds of doubt about whether parents can \nappropriately  care  for  their  children  and  keep  them  safe,  and  are  otherwise \nirreparably harming the parent-child relationship.  \n113.  Defendants’ reckless disregard for the rights of Plaintiffs and other \nparents of Ludlow Public School students has impermissibly supplanted the rights \nof the parents to make mental health decisions and direct the upbringing of their \nchildren, interfered with the privacy rights of the family, created uncertainty and \ndistrust  between  parents  and  children  and  between  parents  and  educators,  and \nthreatened free exercise rights.  \n34 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-30041   Document 1   Filed 04/12/22   Page 36 of 58\n114.  Unless and until Defendants, inter alia, a) publicly rescind the Protocol, \nb) cease communicating to Ludlow Public School staff that parents are not to be \nnotified and punishing staff who notify parents, c) publicly establish a policy that \nparents will be notified when children raise issues related to their mental health and \ndiscordant gender identity, d) cease meeting with children to provide counsel, advice \nand  advocacy  related  to  mental  health  and  discordant  gender  identity  without \nparental notice and consent, and e) cease deceiving parents by using one set of names \nand pronouns when communicating with them and another at school,  Plaintiffs’ \nfundamental rights to direct the upbringing of their children, to make decisions \nregarding their children’s medical and mental health, and right of familial privacy \nwill continue to be violated.   \n115.  Defendants’  ongoing  violations  of  Plaintiffs’  fundamental  parental \nrights have caused and will continue to cause irreparable harm unless and until \ndiscontinued.  \nFIRST CAUSE OF ACTION \nVIOLATION OF CIVIL RIGHTS, 42 U.S.C. § 1983 \n(Violation of Plaintiffs’ Substantive Due Process Fundamental Parental \nRight to Direct the Education and Upbringing of Their Children under \nthe U.S. Constitution) \n(By All Plaintiffs Against all Defendants) \n \n116.

The Due Process Clause in the 14th Amendment to the United States \nConstitution  protects  the  fundamental  right  of  parents  to  direct  the  education, \nupbringing and the care, custody, and control of their children. Pierce v. Society of \nSisters, 268 U.S. 510 (1925); Troxel v. Granville, 530 U.S. 57, 68 (2000).  \n118.  Defendants have violated and are violating Plaintiffs’ fundamental right \nto make decisions regarding the upbringing, education, custody, care, and control of \ntheir children in establishing and implementing the Protocol that prohibits informing \nparents  regarding  their  children’s  assertions  regarding  gender  non-conformity, \ntransgender status and attendant requests to affirm alternate identities unless their \nminor children of any age consent.  \n119.  Defendants  have  acted  and  are  acting  with  reckless  disregard  for \nPlaintiffs’ fundamental parental rights by purposefully and intentionally concealing \ncritical information regarding the upbringing and care of their children, i.e., that the \nchildren are asserting a discordant gender identity, that the children have requested \nto be  addressed by an opposite  sex name and  pronouns and other information \nassociated with affirming the child’s assertions.  \n120.  Defendants  have  acted  and  are  acting  with  reckless  disregard  for \nPlaintiffs’ fundamental parental rights by continuing to implement the Protocol, i.e., \na  de  facto  district  policy  of  undermining  parental  authority  based  on  an \nunsubstantiated assertion that state law and DESE Guidance provide that children of \n36 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-30041   Document 1   Filed 04/12/22   Page 38 of 58\nany age have the authority to determine whether their parents will be informed when \nthey raise issues of gender non-conformity or transgender status, request to be called \nby an alternative name or pronouns and even use privacy facilities designated for the \nopposite sex. In so doing, Defendants are explicitly and intentionally excluding \nPlaintiffs from significant decision-making directly related to their children’s care.  \n121.  Defendants’ reckless disregard for Plaintiffs’ rights has resulted in and \nis resulting in deprivation of their fundamental constitutional rights.  \n122.  Plaintiffs’ constitutionally protected right to direct the upbringing and \neducation of their children was violated as the plainly obvious consequence of \nDefendants’  actions  in  intentionally  and  explicitly  withholding  information  in \naccordance with the Protocol, i.e., a de facto school policy that parents were not to \nbe notified when their children raise issues of gender non-conformity or transgender \nstatus, request to be called by an alternative name or pronouns and even use privacy \nfacilities designated for the opposite sex.   \n123.  Plaintiffs’ constitutionally protected right to direct the upbringing and \neducation of their children was violated as the plainly obvious consequence of \nDefendants’ actions in, inter alia,  a) meeting secretly with their children to engage \nin counseling and advocacy related to mental health and discordant gender identity \nwithout parental notice and consent, b) deceiving parents by using one set of names \nand pronouns when communicating with them and another at school, c) directing \n37 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-30041   Document 1   Filed 04/12/22   Page 39 of 58\nchildren to speak untruthfully by instructing them to use alternate gender pronouns \nand  names  for  their  peers, and  d)  nurturing  distrust  for  parents  through  secret \nmeetings in which parents’ decisions and ability to provide for their children are \nquestioned.  \n124.  Defendants  cannot  assert  a  compelling  interest  for  disregarding \nPlaintiffs’ long-established fundamental constitutional right to direct the upbringing, \ncare, and education of their children, and Defendants’ prohibition against parental \nnotification is not narrowly tailored.  \n125.  Defendants’ violation of Plaintiffs’ fundamental constitutional rights \nhas caused and continues to cause Plaintiffs undue hardship and irreparable harm.  \n126.  Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law to correct the continuing \ndeprivation of their fundamental rights.  \nSECOND CAUSE OF ACTION \nVIOLATION OF CIVIL RIGHTS, 42 U.S.C. § 1983 \n(Violation of Plaintiffs’ Fundamental Parental Right to Direct the Medical \nand Mental Health Decision-making for Their Children Under the U.S. \nConstitution) \n(By All Plaintiffs Against all Defendants) \n \n127.  Plaintiffs incorporate the allegations in paragraphs 1-115 by reference \nas if set forth in full.  \n128.  The Due Process Clause in the 14th Amendment to the United States \nConstitution protects the fundamental right of parents to direct the medical and \n38 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-30041   Document 1   Filed 04/12/22   Page 40 of 58\nmental health decision-making for their children. Parham v. J. R., 442 U.S. 584 \n(1979).  \n129.  The  Commonwealth  of  Massachusetts  has  codified  the  concept  of \nparents  having  the  fundamental  right  to  direct  the  medical  and  mental  health \ndecision-making for their children until age 18 in Mass. G.L. chapter 112, §12F. The \nMassachusetts Supreme Judicial Court has further memorialized that parents, as the \n“natural guardians of their children,” have the right to consent to routine, non-\nemergency treatment of a minor child. See Custody of a Minor, 375 Mass. 733, 747 \n(1978). \n130.  By withholding information regarding their children’s assertion of a \ndiscordant    gender  identity  and  request  to  socially  transition  their  children  by \naffirming that identity with the use of preferred opposite sex names and pronouns \nand adopting the Protocol, Defendants are making decisions that affect the mental \nhealth of their children in contravention of Plaintiffs’ fundamental rights under the \nU.S. Constitution and Massachusetts law.    \n131.  Defendants have usurped Plaintiffs’ responsibility for the health and \nwell-being of their children and sought to supplant their authority for Plaintiffs’   \nauthority as fit parents to be the ultimate decisionmakers regarding the physical and \nmental  health  of  their  children,  including  decisions  related  to  their  children’s \nconfusion or distress about their sex or gender identity. \n39 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-30041   Document 1   Filed 04/12/22   Page 41 of 58\n132.  Defendants have violated and are violating Plaintiffs’ fundamental right \nto make decisions regarding the mental health of their children by adopting the \nProtocol providing that a) parents are not to be notified if their children express a \ndiscordant gender identity; b) parents are presumed to pose a danger to their child’s \nhealth and well-being if notified of their child’s gender confusion or discordant \ngender identity; c) parents are not to be included in meetings with their children to \ndiscuss changes to be made in response to the children’s assertion of a discordant \ngender identity unless the child consents; d) parents are to be intentionally misled \nand lied to when school staff discuss their children, in that staff are to use the \nchildren’s legal name and biologically accurate pronouns when talking to parents \nbut not in other circumstances; e) children are to be permitted to decide which \nprivacy facilities they will use without the involvement of their parents.  \n133.  Affirming  a  child’s  discordant  gender  identity  involves  significant \nmental  health  and  medical  decisions  affecting  the  well-being  of  children  with \npotentially  life-long  consequences.  Therefore,  by  excluding  parents  from \ndiscussions regarding their children’s assertion of a discordant gender identity and \nadopting the Protocol aimed at secretively affirming the discordant gender identity, \nDefendants are making, and have made decisions that affect the mental health of \nPlaintiffs’ children in contravention of Plaintiffs’ fundamental rights as enumerated \nin the U.S. Constitution and Massachusetts law.    \n40 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-30041   Document 1   Filed 04/12/22   Page 42 of 58\n134.  Defendants  have  acted  and  are  acting  with  reckless  disregard  for \nPlaintiffs’ fundamental parental rights by withholding information regarding their \nchildren’s  mental  health  based  on  an  unsubstantiated  assertion  that  state  law, \nregulations and DESE Guidance grant children rights of confidentiality that prohibit \ndisclosing  information  regarding  gender  identity  to  their  own  parents,  thereby \nexplicitly  and  intentionally  excluding  Plaintiffs  from  making  the  mental  health \ndecisions for their children that are exclusively their right to make.   \n135.  Defendants’ reckless disregard for Plaintiffs’ rights has resulted in and \ncontinues to result in deprivation of their fundamental constitutional rights.  \n136.  Plaintiffs’  constitutionally  and  statutorily  protected  rights  to  make \ndecisions regarding the mental health of their children was violated as the plainly \nobvious  consequence  of  Defendants’  actions  in  intentionally  and  explicitly \nwithholding information in accordance with the Protocol, i.e., a de facto school \npolicy that parents were not to be notified when their children raise issues of gender \nnon-conformity or transgender status, request to be called by an alternative name or \npronouns and even use privacy facilities designated for the opposite sex.   \n137.  Plaintiffs’  constitutionally  and  statutorily  protected  rights  to  make \ndecisions regarding the mental health of their children was violated as the plainly \nobvious consequence of Defendants’ actions in, inter alia,  a) meeting secretly with \ntheir children to engage in counseling  and advocacy related to mental health and \n41 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-30041   Document 1   Filed 04/12/22   Page 43 of 58\ndiscordant gender identity without parental notice and consent, b) deceiving parents \nby using one set of names and pronouns when communicating with them and another \nat school, c) directing children to speak untruthfully by instructing them to use \nalternate gender pronouns and names for their peers, and d) nurturing distrust for \nparents through secret meetings in which parents’ decisions and ability to provide \nfor their children are questioned. \n138.  Defendants  cannot  assert  a  compelling  interest  for  disregarding \nPlaintiffs’ long-established fundamental constitutional right to direct the medical \nand mental health care for their child, and Defendants’ prohibition against parental \nnotification is not narrowly tailored.  \n139.  Defendants’ violation of Plaintiffs’ fundamental constitutional rights \nhas caused and continues to cause Plaintiffs undue hardship and irreparable harm.  \n140.  Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law to correct the continuing \ndeprivation of their fundamental rights.  \nTHIRD CAUSE OF ACTION \nVIOLATION OF CIVIL RIGHTS, 42 U.S.C. § 1983 \n(Violation of Plaintiffs’ Right to Familial Privacy Under the U.S. Constitution) \n(By All Plaintiffs Against all Defendants) \n141.  Plaintiffs incorporate the allegations in paragraphs 1-115 by reference \nas if set forth in full.  \n142.  The Due Process Clause in the 14th Amendment to the United States \nConstitution protects the sanctity of the family as an institution deeply rooted in this \n42 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-30041   Document 1   Filed 04/12/22   Page 44 of 58\nNation's history and tradition through which moral and cultural values are passed \ndown. Moore v. East Cleveland, 431 U.S. 494, 503-04 (1977). The Constitution \nprotects the private realm of the family from interference by the state. Prince v. \nMassachusetts, 321 U.S. 158, 166 (1944).  \n143.  In substituting their judgment regarding the mental health of B.F., G.F., \nand other Ludlow Public Schools students for the judgment of their parents by \nimplementing the Protocol to withhold information regarding children’s assertion of \na discordant gender identity and request to affirm that identity without notifying the \nparents, Defendants have impermissibly inserted themselves into the private realm \nof Plaintiffs’ families by usurping Plaintiffs’ rights to make decisions regarding their \nchildren’s upbringing, mental health, and well-being.  \n144.  In substituting their judgment for the judgment of parents by refusing \nto inform parents when their children disclose a discordant gender identity and seek \naffirmation of the identity at school without notifying the parents, Defendants have \nimpermissibly inserted themselves into the private realm of Plaintiffs’ families by \ndepriving B.F., G.F., and other minor Ludlow Public Schools students of their right \nto have decisions regarding their upbringing, mental health and well-being made by \ntheir parents.  \n145.  Defendants  have  infringed  Plaintiffs’  right  to  family  privacy  by \nimplicitly informing children that their parents cannot be trusted to be informed of \n43 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-30041   Document 1   Filed 04/12/22   Page 45 of 58\nor involved in decision-making related to their children’s assertion of a discordant \ngender identity. Defendants have explicitly evidenced their hostility and intent to \ninfringe upon family privacy through public statements that Defendants’ schools are \nthe only safe space for many children and that parental concerns about children’s \nassertions of discordant gender identities are rooted in bigotry.  \n146.  Through their implementation of the Protocol, punishment of teachers \nwho do not comply with it, and public statements denigrating parents who disagree \nwith  the  Protocol,  Defendants  are  nurturing  significant  seeds  of  doubt  within \nchildren’s minds about whether their parents are acting in their best interests. In so \ndoing, Defendants are sowing discord and division in the parent-child relationships \nand violating Plaintiffs’ rights to family privacy.  \n147.  Defendants  have  acted  and  are  acting  with  reckless  disregard  for \nPlaintiffs’ rights to family privacy by their actions in intentionally casting doubt on \nparents’ support and ability to respond appropriately to their children’s expression \nof discordant gender identities and excluding parents from decision-making related \nto their children’s questions regarding their sex and gender identity.   \n148.  Defendants’ deliberate indifference to Plaintiffs’ rights has resulted in \nand continues to result in deprivation of their constitutional rights to family privacy.  \n149.  Plaintiffs’ constitutionally protected rights to familial  privacy were \nviolated as the plainly obvious consequence of Defendants’ actions in intentionally \n44 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-30041   Document 1   Filed 04/12/22   Page 46 of 58\nand explicitly withholding information in accordance with the Protocol, i.e., a de \nfacto school policy that parents were not to be notified when their children raise \nissues of gender non-conformity or transgender status, request to be called by an \nalternative name or pronouns and even use privacy facilities designated for the \nopposite sex.   \n150.  Plaintiffs’  constitutionally  protected  right  to  family  privacy  was \nviolated as the plainly obvious consequence of Defendants’ actions in, inter alia,  a) \nmeeting secretly with their children to engage in counseling and advocacy related to \nmental health and discordant gender identity without parental notice and consent, b) \ndeceiving parents by using one set of names and pronouns when communicating \nwith them and another at school, c) directing children to speak untruthfully by \ninstructing them to use alternate gender pronouns and names for their peers, and d) \nnurturing distrust for parents through secret meetings in which parents’ decisions \nand ability to provide for their children are questioned.  \n151.  Defendants  cannot  assert  a  compelling  state  interest  for  recklessly \ndisregarding Plaintiffs’ constitutional rights to familial privacy, and Defendants’ \nprohibitions  against  parental  notification  and  involvement  in  children’s  mental \nhealth decisions related to gender identity are not narrowly tailored.  \n152.  Defendants’ violation of Plaintiffs’ constitutional rights has caused and \ncontinues to cause Plaintiffs undue hardship and irreparable harm in that Plaintiffs \n45 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-30041   Document 1   Filed 04/12/22   Page 47 of 58\nhave  been  and  are  being  denied  their  right  to  direct  decisions  concerning  the \nupbringing and mental health care for their children without interference from the \nstate, and their children are denied the right to have upbringing and mental health \ndecisions made by their parents in keeping with their family values and sincerely \nheld religious beliefs.   \n153.  Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law to correct the continuing \ndeprivation of their fundamental rights. \nFOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION \nViolation of Civil Rights, 42 U.S.C.  § 1983 \n(Violation of Plaintiffs’ Right to Free Exercise of Religion Under the U.S. \nConstitution) \n(By Plaintiffs Feliciano and Salmeron Against all Defendants) \n154.  Plaintiffs incorporate the allegations in paragraphs 1-115 by reference \nas if set forth in full.   \n155.  The Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment to the United States \nConstitution,  as  applied  to  the  states  by  the  Fourteenth  Amendment,  prohibits \nDefendants from abridging Plaintiffs’ right to free exercise of religion.  \n156.  Plaintiffs have sincerely held religious beliefs that human beings are \ncreated male or female and that the natural created order regarding human sexuality \ncannot be changed regardless of individual feelings, beliefs, or discomfort with one’s \nidentity, and biological reality, as either male or female.  \n46 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-30041   Document 1   Filed 04/12/22   Page 48 of 58\n157.  Plaintiffs have sincerely held religious beliefs that parents have the non-\ndelegable duty to direct the upbringing and beliefs, religious training, and medical \nand mental health care of their children and any intrusion of the government into \nthat realm infringes upon the free exercise of their religion.  \n158.  Plaintiffs have sincerely held religious beliefs that all people are to be \ntreated with respect and compassion, and that respect and compassion do not include \nmisrepresenting an individual’s natural created identity as either a male or a female. \n159.  Plaintiffs have sincerely held religious beliefs that individuals are to \nspeak the truth, including speaking the truth regarding matters of sexual identity as \na male or female.  \n160.  Defendants’ actions in excluding  Plaintiffs  Feliciano and Salmeron \nfrom decision making regarding their children’s sexual and gender identity target \nthe Plaintiffs’ beliefs regarding the created order, human nature, sexuality, gender, \nethics, and morality which constitute central components of their sincerely held \nreligious beliefs.  \n161.  Defendants’ actions have caused a direct and immediate conflict with \nPlaintiffs’ religious beliefs by prohibiting them from being informed of  mental \nhealth  issues  their  children  are  or  might  be  undergoing  and  denying  them  the \nopportunity to seek counseling and guidance for their children in a manner that is \nconsistent with the beliefs sincerely held by their family instead of the government.  \n47 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-30041   Document 1   Filed 04/12/22   Page 49 of 58\n162.  Defendants’  actions  are  coercive  in  that  they  deliberately  supplant \nPlaintiffs’ role as advisors of the moral and religious development of their children \nso that they are not able to direct their children’s mental health care and counseling \nregarding  sex  and  gender  identity  in  accordance  with  their  values  because \nDefendants have substituted the state’s perspective on the issues of sex and gender \nidentity for the perspective of Plaintiffs in violation of Plaintiffs’ free exercise rights.  \n163.  Defendants’ actions are neither neutral nor generally applicable, but \nrather,  specifically  and discriminatorily target the religious speech,  beliefs, and \nviewpoint  of  Plaintiffs  and  thus  expressly  constitute  a  substantial  burden  on \nsincerely held religious beliefs that are contrary to Defendants’ viewpoint regarding \ngender identity and affirmation of a discordant gender identity.  \n164.  No  compelling  state  interest  justifies  the  burdens  Defendants  have \nimposed and are imposing on Plaintiffs’ rights to the free exercise of religion.  \n165.  Defendants’ actions are not the least restrictive means to accomplish \nany permissible government purpose Defendants seek to serve.  \n166.  Defendants’ violation of Plaintiffs’ rights to free exercise of religion \nhas caused, is causing, and will continue to cause Plaintiffs to suffer undue and actual \nhardships.  \n167.  Defendants’ violation of Plaintiffs’ rights to free exercise of religion \nhas caused, is causing, and will continue to cause Plaintiffs to suffer irreparable \n48 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-30041   Document 1   Filed 04/12/22   Page 50 of 58\ninjury.

Plaintiffs incorporate the allegations in paragraphs 1-115 by reference \nas if set forth in full.  \n169.  Art. 2 of the Declaration of Rights of the Massachusetts Constitution \nprohibits Defendants from abridging Plaintiffs’ right to free exercise of religion.  \n170.  Plaintiffs have sincerely held religious beliefs that human beings are \ncreated male or female and that the natural created order regarding human sexuality \ncannot be changed regardless of individual feelings, beliefs, or discomfort with one’s \nidentity, and biological reality, as either male or female.  \n171.  Plaintiffs have sincerely held religious beliefs that parents have the \nexclusive and non-delegable duty to direct the upbringing and beliefs, religious \ntraining, and medical and mental health care of their children and any intrusion of \nthe government into that realm infringes upon the free exercise of their religion.  \n172.  Plaintiffs have sincerely held religious beliefs that all people are to be \ntreated with respect and compassion, and that respect and compassion do not include \nmisrepresenting an individual’s natural created identity as either a male or a female. \n49 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-30041   Document 1   Filed 04/12/22   Page 51 of 58\n173.  Plaintiffs have sincerely held religious beliefs that individuals are to \nspeak the truth, including speaking the truth regarding matters of sexual identity as \na male or female.  \n174.  Defendants’ actions in excluding Plaintiffs Feliciano and Salmeron \nfrom decision making regarding their children’s sexual and gender identity target \nthe Plaintiffs’ beliefs regarding the created order, human nature, sexuality, gender, \nethics, and morality which constitute central components of their sincerely held \nreligious beliefs.  \n175.  Defendants’ actions have caused a direct and immediate conflict with \nPlaintiffs’ religious beliefs by prohibiting them from being informed of  mental \nhealth issues their children are or might be undergoing and seeking counseling and \nguidance for their children in a manner that is consistent with the beliefs held by \ntheir family instead of the government.  \n176.  Defendants’ actions are coercive in that they deliberately usurp and \nsupplant Plaintiffs’ role as advisors of the moral and religious development of their \nchildren so that they are not able to instruct their children regarding sex and gender \nidentity in accordance with their values because Defendants have substituted the \nstate’s perspective on the issues of sex and gender identity for the perspective of \nPlaintiffs in violation of Plaintiffs’ free exercise rights.  \n50 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-30041   Document 1   Filed 04/12/22   Page 52 of 58\n177.  Defendants’ actions are neither neutral nor generally applicable, but \nrather  specifically  and  discriminatorily  target  the  religious  speech,  beliefs,  and \nviewpoint  of  Plaintiffs  and  thus  expressly  constitute  a  substantial  burden  on \nsincerely held religious beliefs that are contrary to Defendants’ viewpoint regarding \ngender identity and affirmation of a discordant gender identity.  \n178.  No  compelling  state  interest  justifies  the  burdens  Defendants  have \nimposed and are imposing on Plaintiffs’ rights to the free exercise of religion.  \n179.  Defendants’ actions are not the least restrictive means to accomplish \nany permissible government purpose Defendants seek to serve.  \n180.  Defendants’ violation of Plaintiffs’ rights to free exercise of religion \nhas caused, is causing, and will continue to cause Plaintiffs to suffer undue and actual \nhardships.  \n181.  Defendants’ violation of Plaintiffs’ rights to free exercise of religion \nhas caused, is causing, and will continue to cause Plaintiffs to suffer irreparable \ninjury.  Plaintiffs  have  no  adequate  remedy  at  law  to  correct  the  continuing \ndeprivation of their most cherished constitutional liberties. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs request the following relief: \n1.

Defendants  have  exceeded  the  bounds  of  legitimate  pedagogical \nconcerns and usurped the role of Plaintiffs Stephen Foote and Marissa Silvestri, \nJonathan Feliciano and Sandra Salmeron, to direct the upbringing of their children, \nmake medical and mental health decisions for their children, and to promote and \npreserve family privacy and integrity.  \n2.  Defendants’  protocol  and  practice  of  concealing  from  parents \ninformation  related  to  their  children’s  gender  identity  and  efforts  to  affirm  a \ndiscordant student gender identity at school violate parents’ fundamental rights \nunder the United States Constitution and violate children’s reciprocal rights to the \ncare and custody of their parents, familial privacy, and integrity. As to Plaintiffs \nJonathan Feliciano and Sandra Salmeron, it also violates their fundamental right to \nfree exercise of religion under the United States Constitution.  \n1 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-30041-MGM   Document 22   Filed 06/21/22   Page 3 of 87\n \n3.  Plaintiffs Stephen Foote and Marissa Silvestri are seeking injunctive \nand declaratory relief and damages under 42 U.S.C. §1983 on behalf of themselves \nand their minor children, B.F. and G.F., for violation of their constitutional rights.  \nPlaintiffs  Jonathan  Feliciano  and  Sandra  Salmeron  are  seeking  injunctive  and \ndeclaratory  relief  and  damages  under  42  U.S.C.  §1983  for  violation  of  their \nconstitutional rights. Plaintiffs also seek costs and attorneys’ fees pursuant to 42 \nU.S.C. §1988.  \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n4.  This action is filed pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 seeking redress of \ninjuries suffered by Plaintiffs from deprivation, under color of state law, of rights \nsecured by the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, \nby  the  laws  of  the  United  States  and  the  laws  of  the  Commonwealth  of \nMassachusetts. Jurisdiction is proper in this Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 \nand 1343(a). Jurisdiction is also proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1332(a)(1) in that the \namount in controversy exceeds $75,000 and is between citizens of different states.  \n5.  Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b) and other \napplicable law because the events and omissions giving rise to the claims in this \naction arose in the Town of Ludlow, Massachusetts which is situated within the \ndistrict and divisional boundaries of the Springfield Division of the U.S. District \n2 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-30041-MGM   Document 22   Filed 06/21/22   Page 4 of 87\n \nCourt for the District of Massachusetts. Venue is also proper in this Court because \nDefendants reside or have their principal place of business in this District. \n6.  This  Court  is  authorized  to  grant  declaratory  judgment  under  the \nDeclaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201-02, implemented through Federal \nRule of Civil Procedure 57, and to issue injunctive relief under Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 65. \n7.  An actual controversy exists between the parties involving substantial \nconstitutional issues, in that Plaintiffs allege that Defendants’ policies, procedures, \ndirectives and actions taken in accordance with them violate the United States \nConstitution and have infringed Plaintiffs’ rights, while Defendants will allege that \ntheir policies, procedures, directives, and actions comport with the U.S. Constitution \nand Massachusetts law.  \n8.  This Court is authorized to grant Plaintiffs’ prayer for relief regarding \ncosts, including a reasonable attorney’s fee, under 42 U.S.C. § 1988. \nPARTIES \n9.

In June 2012, the Massachusetts Board of Elementary and Secondary \nEducation (Board) revised the Access to Equal Education Opportunity Regulations, \n603 CMR 26.00, to include gender identity as a protected class to conform to the \nLegislature’s revision of Massachusetts’ student anti-discrimination provision in \nMass. G.L. c. 76, §5.  \n23.  The  Board  directed  the  Department  of  Elementary  and  Secondary \nEducation  (“DESE”)  to  provide  guidance  to  school  districts  to  assist  in \nimplementing the revised regulations. \n24.  In response to the Board’s directive, DESE published “Guidance for \nMassachusetts Public Schools Creating a Safe and Supportive School Environment,” \n(“Guidance”) offering suggestions for school policies and procedures to address the \nchanges in laws and regulations.  \n25.  The Guidance document has not been adopted as a regulation nor \nenacted as a statute and therefore does not mandate particular policies or have the \nforce of law. \n26.  On March 26, 2013, then-DESE Commissioner Mitchell Chester stated \nat a  public meeting that the Guidance is not a mandate, but advice offered to school \nadministrators and staff.  \n6 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-30041-MGM   Document 22   Filed 06/21/22   Page 8 of 87\n \n27.  In the Guidance, DESE suggests that:  \nConsistent  with  the  statutory  standard,  a  school  should  accept  a \nstudent's assertion of his or her gender identity when there is \"consistent \nand  uniform  assertion  of  the  gender-related  identity,  or  any  other \nevidence that the gender-related identity is sincerely held as part of a \nperson's  core  identity.\"  If  a  student's  gender-related  identity, \nappearance, or behavior meets this standard, the only circumstance in \nwhich a school may question a student's asserted gender identity is \nwhere school personnel have a credible basis for believing that the \nstudent's gender-related identity is being asserted for some improper \npurpose. https://www.doe.mass.edu/sfs/lgbtq/ GenderIdentity.html \n \n28.    The Guidance further suggests:  \nSome transgender and gender nonconforming students are not openly \nso at home for reasons such as safety concerns or lack of acceptance. \nSchool  personnel  should  speak  with  the  student  first  before \ndiscussing a student's gender nonconformity or transgender status \nwith the student’s parent or guardian. For the same reasons, school \npersonnel should discuss with the student how the school should refer \nto the student, e.g., appropriate pronoun use, in written communication \nto the student's parent or guardian. Id. (emphasis added). \n \n29.   In the Guidance, DESE states that in the case of “young students” \nparents should be consulted regarding issues of disclosure of the students’ assertion \nof a discordant gender identity. Id. The Guidance does not define “young students.” \n30.  DESE’s Guidance also says:  \nTransgender and gender nonconforming students may decide to discuss \nand express their gender identity openly and may decide when, with \nwhom, and how much to share private information. A student who is \n14 years of age or older, or who has entered the ninth grade, may \nconsent to disclosure of information from his or her student record. If \na student is under 14 and is not yet in the ninth grade, the student’s \nparent (alone) has the authority to decide on disclosures and other \nstudent record matters.  \n7 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-30041-MGM   Document 22   Filed 06/21/22   Page 9 of 87\n \n \nId.  (emphasis  added)  (citing  Section  23.01  of  Title  603  of  the  Code  of \nMassachusetts Regulations (603 CMR§23.01).  \n31.   Information regarding a student’s sex, name change for gender identity \npurposes, gender transition, medical or mental health treatment related to gender \nidentity, or any other information of a similar nature, regardless of its form, is part \nof the individual's student record, subject to 603 CMR §23.01. \n32.  Pursuant to 603 CMR §23.01 consent to disclosure of information \nregarding  a  student’s  sex,  name  change  for  gender  identity  purposes,  gender \ntransition, and/or medical or mental health treatment related to gender identity lies \nexclusively with parents until the student is in ninth grade or age 14, unless a local \nschool committee has adopted an alternative policy. \nDefendants’ Re-interpretation of DESE Guidance And Development of \nProtocol to Conceal Information From Parents. \n \n33.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe and based thereon allege that the \nSchool Committee has not adopted a formal written policy superseding 603 CMR \n§23.01 to provide students under the age of 14 or below grade 9 with the sole \nauthority to give or withhold consent to disclosure of information regarding sex, \nname change for gender identity purposes, gender transition or medical or mental \nhealth treatment related to gender identity. \n8 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-30041-MGM   Document 22   Filed 06/21/22   Page 10 of 87\n \n34.   Plaintiffs are informed and believe and based thereon allege that the \nSchool Committee, acting as final policymaker for the Town, has re-interpreted the \nDESE guidance as a mandate requiring that staff shall not speak with parents \nregarding gender identity issues at all unless the child consents, instead of suggesting \nthat school personnel should speak with a student first before discussing gender \nidentity issues with parents.  \n35.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe and based thereon allege that the \nSchool  Committee,  acting  as  final  policymaker  for  the  Town,  has  used  its \nreinterpretation of the DESE Guidance to give children of any age the authority to \ndetermine whether their parents will be notified about decisions related to affirming \nthe  child’s  discordant  gender  identity,  which  is  a  mental  health  issue,  thereby \nusurping Plaintiffs’ fundamental parental rights to direct the upbringing and mental \nhealth care of their children.  \n36.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe and based thereon allege that the \nSchool Committee and individual Defendants have used the School Committee \nsanctioned  re-interpretation  of  DESE  Guidance  to  establish  and  implement  a \nprotocol (hereinafter sometimes “Protocol”) that parents are not to be informed of \ntheir child’s transgender status and gender-affirming social transition to a discordant \ngender identity unless the child, of any age, consents. \n9 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-30041-MGM   Document 22   Filed 06/21/22   Page 11 of 87\n \n37.   Plaintiffs are informed and believe and based thereon allege that until \nJuly  2021  Defendant  Gazda  as  Superintendent  of  Ludlow  Public  Schools \nimplemented the Protocol throughout Ludlow Public Schools so that administrators, \nteachers,  counselors  and  other  staff  at  all  schools  would  conceal  from  parents \ninformation regarding their child’s transgender status and social transition to a \ndiscordant gender identity, including adoption of alternative names and pronouns, \nunless the child consented. \n38.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe and based thereon allege that from \nJuly 2021 to the present Defendant Nemeth, as Interim Superintendent of Ludlow \nPublic Schools, has continued to implement the Protocol throughout Ludlow Public \nSchools so that administrators, teachers, counselors and other staff at all schools \nconceal from parents information regarding their child’s transgender status and \nsocial transition to a discordant gender identity, including adoption of alternative \nnames and pronouns, unless the child consents. \n39.  Plaintiffs  are  informed  and  believe  and  based  thereon  allege  that \nDefendant Stacy Monette in her role as Principal implemented the Protocol at Baird \nMiddle School so that administrators, teachers, counselors, and other staff conceal \nfrom parents, including Plaintiffs, information regarding their child’s transgender \nstatus and social transition to a discordant gender identity, including adoption of \nalternative names and pronouns, unless the child consents. \n10 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-30041-MGM   Document 22   Filed 06/21/22   Page 12 of 87\n \n40.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe and based thereon allege that the \nProtocol continues to be implemented in all schools in Ludlow Public Schools, \nmeaning that District staff are directed to deliberately and intentionally conceal from \nparents, including all Plaintiffs, information regarding their child’s (regardless of \nage)  transgender  status  and  social  transition  to  a  discordant  gender  identity, \nincluding adoption of alternative names and pronouns, unless the child consents. \n41.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe and based thereon allege that the \nProtocol  further  provides that District  staff  are  to deliberately deceive  parents, \nincluding all Plaintiffs, by continuing to refer to their child by his or her birth name \nand  pronouns  in  the  presence  of  the  parents,  but  to  use  the  child’s  preferred \nalternative name and pronouns at all other times.  \n42.  Plaintiffs  are  informed  and  believe  and  based  thereon  allege  that \nthroughout  the  time  that  they  have  sanctioned  and  implemented  the  Protocol, \nDefendants have known or have reason to know that “social transitioning,” including \nassertion of an alternate name and pronouns, is recognized as a medical/mental \nhealth treatment for children with gender dysphoria1:  \nFor young transgender children, the treatment of gender dysphoria \nconsists of social transition, which involves changes that bring the \nchild’s outer appearance and lived experience into alignment with the \nchild’s core gender. Changes often associated with a social transition \n \n1    By describing gender affirmation as a medical/mental health treatment for \ngender dysphoria, plaintiffs are not waiving any claims to challenge the medical or \nscientific validity of such therapies. \n11 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-30041-MGM   Document 22   Filed 06/21/22   Page 13 of 87\n \ninclude changes in clothing, name, pronouns, and hairstyle. Adams v. \nThe Sch. Bd. of St. Johns Cty, Fla., No. 3:17-cv-00739, (M.D.Fla. June \n28, 2017), Diane Ehrensaft Exp. Rep. 10-11 ECF 137-2. \n \n“Social role transition is a critical component of the treatment for \nGender Dysphoria” for adults and children. G.G. v. Gloucester Cty Sch. \nBd., No.  4:15-cv-54 (E.D.Va. June 11, 2015) Randi Ettner Correct Exp. \nDecl. 5, ECF 58-2 \n \n43.  By engaging in “social transitioning” with children, as provided in the \nProtocol, Defendants are “implementing a psychosocial treatment...”2 without the \nknowledge or consent of parents. \n44.  Defendants  know  or  should  know  that  under  Massachusetts  law, \nparents must consent to medical treatment, including mental health treatment, of \ntheir children under age 18 unless the child is emancipated, married, in the armed \nforces, pregnant or contracted a sexually transmitted disease, none of which applies \nto Plaintiffs’ children. M.G.L. ch. 231, §85P, M.G.L. ch. 112 §12F. \n45.  By approving and implementing the Protocol, Defendants are acting \ncontrary to law by deliberately concealing from Plaintiffs that their minor children \nare receiving mental health care, i.e. social transitioning to a discordant gender \nidentity, at school without the parents’ knowledge or consent.  \n \n2   Kenneth  Zucker,  The  Myth  of  Persistence:  Response  to  “A  Critical \nCommentary on Follow-Up Studies & 'Desistance' Theories about Transgender & \nGender  Non-Conforming  Children”  by  Temple  Newhook  et  al.,  19:2 \nINTERNATIONAL  JOURNAL  OF  TRANSGENDERISM  231  (2018), \nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/325443416. \n12 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-30041-MGM   Document 22   Filed 06/21/22   Page 14 of 87\n \n46.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe and based thereon allege that as part \nof implementing the Protocol, the School Committee acting as final policymaker for \nthe Town has sanctioned, and individual Defendants have implemented customs, \npractices and procedures that introduce and promote the concept of gender-affirming \nsocial  transitioning,  i.e.,  mental  health  treatment,  and  experimentation  with \ndiscordant gender identities to children without the knowledge or consent of their \nparents.  \n47.  Among  the  customs,  practices  and  procedures  implemented  by \nindividual Defendants was Defendant Funke’s practice of directing incoming sixth \ngrade students at Baird Middle School to create biographic videos in which they \nwere to state their “gender identity” and preferred pronouns and upload the videos \nonto school owned platforms.  \n48.  The videorecording and identification of a gender identity (an aspect of \nmental health) was done without the knowledge and consent of parents.  \n49.  Plaintiffs Foote and Silvestri became aware after the fact that their 11-\nyear-old daughter, B.F. was given that video and identification assignment.  \n50.  Plaintiffs  Foote  and  Silvestri  are  informed  and  believe  and  based \nthereon  allege  that  their  son  G.F.  was  also  given  the  video  and  identification \nassignment by Defendant Funke without their knowledge and consent.  \n13 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-30041-MGM   Document 22   Filed 06/21/22   Page 15 of 87\n \n51.  It remains unknown to Plaintiffs Foote and Silvestri how these videos \nof their children, made without their consent, were used or who has been allowed to \nview them. \n52.  Plaintiffs  are  informed  and  believe  and  based  thereon  allege  that \nDefendant Funke, acting in accordance with the Committee’s approved Protocol and \nwith the knowledge and consent of other individual Defendants, engaged in other \ncustoms,  practices  and  procedures  aimed  at  promoting  exploration  and \nexperimentation of discordant gender identities and engaging in gender-affirming \nsocial  transitioning,  concepts  which involve  mental  health  issues,  to  Plaintiffs’ \nchildren and other Baird Middle School students without notice to or consent of \nparents, including Plaintiffs.  \n53.  Plaintiffs  are  informed  and  believe  and  based  thereon  allege  that \nDefendant Funke regularly communicated privately with their children one-on-one \nto discuss their gender identity (mental health) issues, provide materials promoting \nexploration  of  alternate  gender  identities,  and  otherwise  encourage  children  to \nexperiment with alternate gender identities without notifying parents or obtaining \nparental consent.  \n54.  Plaintiffs  are  informed  and  believe  and  based  thereon  allege  that \nDefendant Funke instructed their children not to use the terms “boys” and “girls,” \n14 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-30041-MGM   Document 22   Filed 06/21/22   Page 16 of 87\n \nbut to use alternative terms rooted in gender identity ideology, which were posted \non the walls of the library and circulated to students as a handout.  \n55.  Plaintiffs were not informed of Defendant Funke’s efforts to compel \ntheir children to speak falsely (in accordance with the ideology being promoted by \nDefendant Funke) and to conceal important information from their parents.  \n56.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe and based thereon allege that other \nteachers, counselors and staff, with the knowledge and consent of Defendants in \naccordance with the Committee’s Protocol, engaged in other customs, practices and \nprocedures to introduce and promote the concepts of experimenting with discordant \ngender  identities  and  engaging  in  gender-affirming  social  transitioning  (which \ninvolves mental health treatment), to their children and other students without notice \nto or consent of parents, including Plaintiffs. \n57.  Because  Defendants’  Protocol  requires  secrecy,  full  information \nregarding the customs, practices and procedures utilized by school staff to introduce \nand  facilitate  gender-affirming  social  transitioning  to  Plaintiffs’  children  (and \nothers) has been concealed from Plaintiffs. \nDefendants’ Implementation of the Protocol with Plaintiffs’ Children  \n58.  On or about December 14, 2020, B.F., then an 11-year-old sixth grade \nstudent at Baird Middle School, asked to meet with her teacher Bonnie Manchester \nvirtually after school to discuss some issues.  \n15 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-30041-MGM   Document 22   Filed 06/21/22   Page 17 of 87\n \n59.  On December 15, 2020, B.F. met virtually with Ms. Manchester and \ntold her that she was experiencing insecurity, low self-esteem, poor self-image, and \na perceived lack of popularity.  \n60.  Plaintiffs  Foote  and  Silvestri  are  informed  and  believe  and  based \nthereon allege that prior to the meeting with Ms. Manchester B.F. had received \nunsolicited LGBTQ-themed video suggestions on her school Google account on her \nschool-issued computer  \n61.  Plaintiffs  Foote  and  Silvestri  are  informed  and  believe  and  based \nthereon allege that after viewing these suggested videos B.F. began questioning \nwhether she might be attracted to girls and whether she might have “gender identity” \nissues.  \n62.  B.F. told Ms. Manchester that she was depressed and needed help but \nwas not sure how to ask her parents about getting help.  \n63.  Ms. Manchester offered to call B.F.’s parents and B.F. agreed. B.F. told \nMs. Manchester that she was relieved and grateful that Ms. Manchester was calling \nher parents because B.F. was unsure how to broach the subject.  \n64.  On December 16, 2020, during a planning meeting, Ms. Manchester \nand other teachers said that they had observed that B.F. seemed to be depressed and \nagreed that B.F.’s parents should be contacted. Ms. Manchester agreed to contact \nthem since she had already discussed doing so with B.F.  \n16 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-30041-MGM   Document 22   Filed 06/21/22   Page 18 of 87\n \n65.  On December 17, 2020, Ms. Manchester contacted Mrs. Silvestri and \ninformed  her  of  the  conversation  with  B.F.  and  concerns  about  B.F.  feeling \ndepressed.  \n66.  Ms. Manchester also told Mrs. Silvestri that B.F. had said that she might \nbe attracted to the same sex and was having issues with self-image.  \n67.  Mrs. Silverstri responded that she had recently observed that there was \nsomething troubling B.F. and that she had struggled with self-image issues at B.F.’s \nage. \n68.  Mrs. Silvestri was grateful that Ms. Manchester had contacted her so \nthat she and the children’s father, not the school, could address B.F.’s mental health \nissues.  \n69.  Mrs. Silvestri and Mr. Foote retained a private therapist to work with \nB.F. soon after the call with Ms. Manchester. \n70.  On December 21, 2020, Mrs. Silvestri sent the following email to B.F.’s \nteachers, Defendant Monette, Defendant Gazda, and the members of Defendant \nSchool Committee:  \nIt has been brought to the attention of both Stephen and myself that \nsome of B’s teachers are concerned with her mental health. I appreciate \nyour concern and would like to let you know that her father and I will \nbe getting her the professional help she needs at this time. With that \nbeing said, we request that you do not have any private conversations \nwith B. in regards to this matter. Please allow us to address this as a \nfamily and with the proper professionals.  \n \n17 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-30041-MGM   Document 22   Filed 06/21/22   Page 19 of 87\n \n71.  Plaintiffs  Foote  and  Silvestri  are  informed  and  believe  and  based \nthereon  allege  that  Defendants  Gazda  and  Monette  and  Baird  Middle  School \nteachers  who  had  received  the  email  disregarded  the  parents’  instructions  and \nDefendants Gazda and Monette failed and refused to direct Baird Middle School \nstaff to respect Plaintiffs’ instructions regarding their 11-year-old daughter’s mental \nhealth care.  \n72.  Plaintiffs  Foote  and  Silvestri  are  informed  and  believe  and  based \nthereon  allege that prior  to  June  2021 Defendant Gazda,  and since June  2021 \nDefendant  Nemeth,  along  with  Defendant  Monette  and  Baird  Middle  School \nteachers who received the email, have and are continuing to disregard the parents’ \ninstructions, as evidenced by the fact that Plaintiffs are now aware that B.F. has \nchanged her preferred name at least twice since December 2020 without Plaintiffs’ \nknowledge or consent. To this date staff continue to address B.F. by whatever \niteration of her name she has indicated she prefers. \n73.  Teachers at Baird Middle School have inadvertently revealed that they \nare  continuing  to  disregard  the  parents’  instructions  by  sending  email \ncommunications related to school assignments for B.F., but referencing a child with \na first name other than “B.”  \n74.  Plaintiffs Foote and Silvestri have learned that, in reckless disregard of \ntheir parental rights to make mental health decisions for their children and in direct \n18 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-30041-MGM   Document 22   Filed 06/21/22   Page 20 of 87\n \ncontravention  to  their  explicit  instructions,  Baird  Middle  School  staff,  and  in \nparticular  Defendant  Foley,  have  engaged  in  regular  private  meetings  and \nconversations with B.F. in which B.F. has talked about having a discordant gender \nidentity and requested to be affirmed in that identity and called by a male name “R,” \ni.e., engage in gender-affirming social transitioning (mental health treatment). In \naddition, Baird Middle School staff and Defendant Foley in particular intentionally \nconcealed that information from Plaintiffs in accordance with the Protocol. \n75.  Plaintiffs  Foote  and  Silvestri  are  informed  and  believe  and  based \nthereon allege that Defendants Funke and Monette and other Baird Middle School \nstaff have also disregarded and are continuing to disregard the parents’ instructions \nand the parents’ right to make mental health decisions for their son G.F.  \n76.  G.F.  has  been  diagnosed  with  ADHD  and  has  in  place  an \nAccommodation Plan under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. \n§§ 701 et. seq. (“504 Plan”).  \n77.  Defendants knew or should have known of G.F.’s status as a 504 Plan \nrecipient and that such status meant that G.F. had underlying mental health issues \nwhich required parental notice and input.  \n78.  Plaintiffs  Foote  and  Silverstri  are  informed  and  believe  and  based \nthereon allege that Defendants Funke and Monette and other Baird Middle School \nstaff, knowing that G.F. had underlying mental health issues requiring parental \n19 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-30041-MGM   Document 22   Filed 06/21/22   Page 21 of 87\n \nnotice  and  input,  engaged  in  private  meetings  and  conversations  with G.F.  on \nmultiple occasions to promote experimenting with alternative genders and facilitate \nhis gender-affirming social transitioning, i.e. offer mental health treatment.  \n79.  Said Baird Middle School staff did not notify Plaintiffs of these private \nmeetings  and  conversations,  but  followed  the  Protocol  to  conceal  the  gender-\naffirming social transitioning of G.F. from Plaintiffs Foote and Silvestri in the same \nmanner as they concealed the gender-affirming social transitioning of B.F.  \n80.  Plaintiffs  Foote  and  Silvestri  are  informed  and  believe  and  based \nthereon allege that Defendants have stated in writing in G.F.’s student health record \nthat G.F.’s discordant gender identity and alternate name are to be concealed from \nhis parents and that staff are to intentionally deceive parents by using “G.F.” in their \npresence and G.F.’s alternate name at all other times.  \nPlaintiffs Discover Defendants’ Subterfuge \n81.  Unbeknownst  to  Plaintiffs,  on  February  28,  2021,  B.F.  sent  the \nfollowing email to Defendant Foley, Defendant Gazda, and teachers at Baird Middle \nSchool, including Ms. Manchester:  \nHello everyone, If you are reading this you are either my teacher or \nguidance counselor. I have an announcement to make and I trust you \nguys with this information. I am genderqueer. Basically, it means I use \nany pronouns (other than it/its). This also means I have a name change. \nMy new name will be R****.  Please call me by that name. If you \ndeadname me or use any pronouns I am not comfortable with I will \npolitely tell you. I am telling you this because I feel like I can trust you. \nA  list  of  pronouns  you  can  use  are:  she/her  he/him  they/them \n20 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-30041-MGM   Document 22   Filed 06/21/22   Page 22 of 87\n \nfae/faerae/aer  ve/ver xe/xem ze/zir. I have added a link so you can look \nat how to say them. Please only use the ones I have listed and not the \nother ones. I do not like them. Thank you. R*** F***.  \n \n82.  Plaintiffs  Foote  and  Silvestri  are  informed  and  believe  and  based \nthereon allege that the text of the email sent by B.F. resembles sample emails found \non internet sites that promote gender ideology and offer resources to children and \nadolescents.  \n83.  Plaintiffs  Foote  and  Silvestri  are  informed  and  believe  and  based \nthereon allege that on March 1, 2021, Defendant Foley sent an email after meeting \nprivately with B.F., in direct contradiction to their explicit instructions, and wrote: \n“R**** [B****] is still in the process of telling his [sic] parents and is requesting \nthat school staff refer to him [sic] as B**** and use she/her pronouns with her \nparents and in written emails/letters home.”  \n84.  In  so  doing,  Defendant  Foley  was,  in  keeping  with  the  School \nCommittee sanctioned Protocol, directing Baird Middle School staff to deliberately \nand intentionally deceive Plaintiffs Foote and Silvestri by actively concealing the \nfact that school staff were engaging in gender-affirming social transitioning (mental \nhealth treatment) of their daughter by affirming an alternative name and identity.  \n85.  Plaintiffs  Foote  and  Silvestri  are  informed  and  believe  and  based \nthereon  allege  that  on  March  1,  2021  some  teachers  at  Baird  Middle  School \n21 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-30041-MGM   Document 22   Filed 06/21/22   Page 23 of 87\n \nimmediately began to refer to B.F. as “R” and to change name tags to reflect that \nname without notifying B.F.’s parents, in keeping with the Protocol.  \n86.  Plaintiffs  Foote  and  Silvestri  are  informed  and  believe  and  based \nthereon allege that on or about March 1, 2021, Defendant Foley referred B.F. to \nDefendant Funke for further private meetings and conversations to promote and \nfacilitate  B.F.’s  gender-affirming  social  transitioning  (mental  health  treatment) \nwithout notifying Plaintiffs.  \n87.  Mr. Foote and Mrs. Silvestri only learned about B.F.’s February 28, \n2021 email to her teachers and counselors after a conversation with Ms. Manchester.  \n88.  Plaintiffs  Foote  and  Silvestri  are  informed  and  believe  and  based \nthereon allege that on March 8, 2021, after the conversation between Plaintiffs and \nMs. Manchester, Ms. Foley sent an email to the entire staff at Baird Middle School \ninforming them of B.F.’s request to be called “R***” and explicitly instructing staff \nthat her parents were not to be told. \n89.  Plaintiffs  Foote  and  Silvestri  are  informed  and  believe  and  based \nthereon allege that on and before March 4, 2021 G.F.’s teachers at Baird Middle \nSchool were also complying with and implementing the Protocol with regard to G.F. \nand facilitating G.F.’s gender-affirming social transitioning without the knowledge \nor consent of Mr. Foote and Mrs. Silvestri.  \n22 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-30041-MGM   Document 22   Filed 06/21/22   Page 24 of 87\n \n90.  Plaintiffs  Foote  and  Silvestri  are  informed  and  believe  and  based \nthereon allege that on March 10, 2021 during a planning meeting, Ms. Manchester \nand other Baird Middle School teachers discussed B.F.’s email and discussed that \nthey were also calling B.F.’s brother G.F. by his preferred name “S.” \n91.  Plaintiffs  Foote  and  Silvestri  are  informed  and  believe  and  based \nthereon allege that during the planning meeting on March 10, 2021 Ms. Foley told \nthe teachers present that “the law” says that school staff do not have to tell parents \nabout their children’s requests to change their name or otherwise be socially affirmed \nin an asserted transgender identity.  \n92.  Massachusetts law provides that parents exercise access to, and have \nexclusive control over, information in their child’s student record until the child \nreaches age 14 or enters the ninth grade. See 603 CMR §23.07(2). \n93.  At the time that Ms. Foley claimed that “the law” does not require \ninforming parents regarding their child’s gender identity, B.F. was 11 years old and \nG.F. was 12 years old, meaning that their parents, Plaintiffs Foote and Silvestri, had \nthe right to access and control over the information in their records, including their \nassertions of discordant gender identities, under Massachusetts law.   \n94.  Even the DESE Guidance, which Defendants know is not a law, does \nnot  proscribe  notifying  parents  regarding  their  children’s  discordant  gender \n23 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-30041-MGM   Document 22   Filed 06/21/22   Page 25 of 87\n \nidentities, but merely suggests speaking with students before speaking with parents \nabout the issue.  \n95.  Plaintiffs  Foote  and  Silvestri  are  informed  and  believe  and  based \nthereon allege that on March 11, 2021, Defendant Foley, without notification to or \nconsent from Mr. Foote or Mrs. Silvestri, initiated a private conversation with B.F. \nthrough an online chat inquiring about issues related to her gender identity, i.e., \nmental health.  \n96.  Plaintiffs  Foote  and  Silvestri  are  informed  and  believe  and  based \nthereon allege that on March 11, 2021, Defendant Foley, without notification to or \nconsent from Mr. Foote or Mrs. Silvestri privately informed B.F. that she could use \nany bathroom that she preferred, including the boys’ bathroom, girls’ bathroom, or \none of three gender neutral bathrooms at the school. Defendant Foley offered to \nshow B.F. where the gender neutral bathrooms were located.  \n97.  Therefore, as of March 11, 2021, Mr. Foote’s and Mrs. Silvestri’s 11-\nyear-old daughter was being told that she could use the boys’ privacy facilities at \nschool, where she would be exposed to middle school boys in various states of \nundress and vice-versa, without Mr. Foote and Mrs. Silvestri being informed or \nconsenting to same.  \n98.  Plaintiffs  Foote  and  Silvestri  are  informed  and  believe  and  based \nthereon allege that on March 11, 2021, Defendant Foley told B.F. in an online chat \n24 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-30041-MGM   Document 22   Filed 06/21/22   Page 26 of 87\n \nthat B.F. was “brave and awesome” for telling her teachers and guidance counselor \nthat she was “genderqueer” and wanted to be referred to by the name “R.” \n99.  On March 18, 2021, Plaintiffs Foote and Silvestri met with Defendant \nMonette to discuss the Defendants’ disregard of the Plaintiffs’ parental rights and of \nthe Plaintiffs’ specific instructions that school staff not engage with their children \nregarding mental health issues, which they were addressing with the help of a mental \nhealth professional, in keeping with their fundamental parental rights to direct the \nmental health care of their children. \n100.  Mr. Foote and Mrs. Silvestri attempted to discuss the issues related to \ntheir children with Defendant Monette and to convey that Defendants were acting \nimproperly and illegally in disregarding their parental rights and failing to notify \nthem regarding their children’s assertion of discordant gender identities and names.  \n101.  Defendant Monette refused to discuss the issues with Mr. Foote and \nMrs. Silvestri, but intimated that the school knew better than did the parents about \nwhat was best for B.F. and G.F. with regard to the gender identity issue and abruptly \nended the meeting. \n102.  On March 21, 2021, Mrs. Silvestri informed Defendant Gazda that she \nand Mr. Foote objected to the staff’s deliberate disregard of their rights as parents to \nmake decisions regarding their children’s mental health and upbringing evident in \n25 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-30041-MGM   Document 22   Filed 06/21/22   Page 27 of 87\n \nconcealing information regarding the gender-affirming social transitioning of their \nchildren.   \n103.  Mrs.  Silvestri  said  that  their  children  telling  teachers  and  fellow \nstudents “that they want to be called by a different name (of the opposite sex) is \nsomething that will follow the children through school and not be forgotten by \nclassmates.”  \n104.  Mrs. Silvestri told Mr. Gazda that parents, not the school, should be the \nprimary  source  of  help  and  guidance  to  navigate  their  children  through  such \ndecisions with long-term effects, and the school’s exclusion of her and Mr. Foote \nfrom that decision-making was unacceptable.  \n105.  Mrs. Silvestri reminded Mr. Gazda that no one to whom their original \nDecember  20,  2020  email  was  addressed  responded.  Instead,  the  parents  were \nignored by teachers, guidance counselors, Ms. Monette, Mr. Gazda, and the School \nCommittee, who utterly disregarded the parents’ explicit instructions to not engage \nin conversations with their children related to their mental health to permit the \nparents to exercise their primary authority to oversee their children’s mental health \ncare. \n106.  Mr.  Gazda  acknowledged  that  he  and  the  School  Committee  had \nreceived the parents’ December 20, 2020 email, but that neither he nor anyone from \nthe School Committee had responded.  \n26 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-30041-MGM   Document 22   Filed 06/21/22   Page 28 of 87\n \n107.  Mr. Gazda expressly asserted that Ms. Foley acted appropriately in \nconcealing information from Plaintiffs when B.F. sent the February 28, 2021 email \nto Baird Middle School teachers and Ms. Foley.  \n108.  Mr. Gazda stated that Ms. Foley properly followed DESE Guidance \nthat  “School  personnel should  speak with the student  first before  discussing  a \nstudent's gender nonconformity or transgender status with the student’s parent or \nguardian” when she forwarded the B.F.’s February 28, 2021 email to other staff and \ntold staff that parents were not to be told.  \n109.  Mr. Gazda’s statement that directing school staff to conceal information \nfrom parents was a proper action by Ms. Foley evidences that Mr. Gazda was aware \nof and approved the School Committee’s sanctioned Protocol granting children of \nany age the power to determine whether their parents will be informed about the \nchild’s gender-affirming social transitioning (mental health treatment).  \n110.   Mr. Gazda further evidenced his knowledge and acceptance of the \nProtocol when he told Mrs. Silvestri that Defendant Foley’s directive to staff that \nPlaintiffs not be informed of their daughter’s preferred alternate pronouns and be \nintentionally misinformed and lied to in conversations concerning their daughter was \nan appropriate response in light of the DESE Guidance suggesting that staff speak \nto children first.  \n27 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-30041-MGM   Document 22   Filed 06/21/22   Page 29 of 87\n \n111.  Mr.  Gazda  further  claimed  that  concealing  information  regarding \nPlaintiffs’ 11-year-old daughter’s asserted discordant gender identity and alternate \nnames and pronouns did not violate 603 CMR §23.01 because no “disclosure” was \nmade, presumably meaning that there was no disclosure to a third party.  \n112.  Mr. Gazda did not explain how a regulation that granted Plaintiffs \naccess and control of their children’s records could be utilized to deny them access \nto information in those records.  \n113.  Mr. Gazda reiterated his conclusions during a meeting with Mr. Foote \nand  Mrs.  Silvestri  on  March  26,  2021,  but  still  did  not  explain  how  DESE \nsuggestions  about  speaking  with  students  about  gender  identity  issues  before \nspeaking with parents could be interpreted to mean that minor students had absolute \nveto power over their parents being informed about their child’s social transitioning.  \n114.  At the March 26, 2021 meeting, Mr. Foote and Mrs. Silvestri again \ndemanded  that  school  staff  not  talk  to  their  children  about  discordant  gender \nidentities and that school staff use the children’s proper names, but they received no \nresponse.  \n115.  Plaintiffs  Foote  and  Silverstri  are  informed  and  believe  and  based \nthereon allege that Ms. Foley, Ms. Funke and perhaps other staff members at Baird \nMiddle School continued to knowingly, intentionally, and recklessly disregard Mr. \nFoote’s and Mrs. Silvestri’s explicit instructions not to engage with their children \n28 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-30041-MGM   Document 22   Filed 06/21/22   Page 30 of 87\n \nregarding  alternative  genders,  preferred  names,  and  mental  health  issues  by \nsurreptitiously setting up meetings to discuss B.F.’s and G.F.’s assertion discordant \ngender identities without the knowledge and consent of their parents.  \n116.  Plaintiffs  Foote  and  Silverstri  are  informed  and  believe  and  based \nthereon allege that, without the knowledge or consent of the Plaintiffs, Ms. Funke \ndirected 11-year-old B.F. to translategender.org, an organization with which Funke \nis affiliated that “works to generate community accountability individuals to self-\ndetermine their own genders and gender expressions.” \n117.  Plaintiffs  Foote  and  Silverstri  are  informed  and  believe  and  based \nthereon allege that Ms. Funke used translategender.org to groom 11-year-old B.F. \nthrough promotion of materials and events, including workshops entitled “Green, \nYellow, Red, Stoplights For Mental Health,” and “The Sex Education You Didn’t \nGet in School,” without the knowledge or consent of her parents.  \n118.  Plaintiffs  Foote  and  Silverstri  are  informed  and  believe  and  based \nthereon allege that after they had repeated their request to Principal Monette and \nSuperintendent  Gazda  that  Baird  Middle  School  staff  cease  talking  with  their \nchildren regarding gender issues, Ms. Foley encouraged B.F. to meet privately with \nher weekly to discuss B.F.’s gender issues and mental health and to promote and \nfacilitate B.F.’s social transition.  \n29 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-30041-MGM   Document 22   Filed 06/21/22   Page 31 of 87\n \n119.  Plaintiffs  Foote  and  Silverstri  are  informed  and  believe  and  based \nthereon allege that on March 30, 2021, Ms. Foley told B.F. that she was worried \nabout B.F. based on a conversation with B.F. the day before.  \n120.  Ms. Foley said that she wanted B.F. to speak to another counselor, “I \ncan't be the only person that you talk to because we don't have enough time together \nand I can’t be there to keep you safe,” thereby signaling to B.F. that her parents were \nnot “safe.”  \n121.  Despite claiming to be concerned about B.F.’s safety, Ms. Foley did not \ncontact B.F.’s parents to share her concerns, further evidencing that Ms. Foley was \nimplying that B.F.’s parents were “unsafe.”  \n122.  Plaintiffs  Foote  and  Silverstri  are  informed  and  believe  and  based \nthereon allege that when B.F. informed Ms. Foley that she was seeing a counselor \nchosen by her parents, Ms. Foley questioned whether  B.F. was as comfortable \ndiscussing issues with that counselor as she was discussing issues with Ms. Foley.  \n123.  Ms. Foley’s question sent a message to B.F. that her parents’ choice \nmight not be in her best interest.  \n124.  Ms. Foley further stated that she believed that B.F. needed to get help \nand support, sending the message to B.F. that her parents could not be trusted to \nprovide help and support.  \n30 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-30041-MGM   Document 22   Filed 06/21/22   Page 32 of 87\n \n125.  Plaintiffs  Foote  and  Silvestri  are  informed  and  believe  and  based \nthereon allege that Ms. Foley continued to question whether B.F.’s parents were \nproviding B.F. with appropriate care in online chats in which she asked B.F. whether \nthe counselor chosen by her parents was providing adequate care, and in stating that \nshe was “behind” B.F., sending the message that B.F. needed further or different \ncare than was being offered by her parents.   \n126.  Plaintiffs  Foote  and  Silvestri  are  informed  and  believe  and  based \nthereon allege that on April 7, 2021, Ms. Foley again questioned whether B.F.’s \nparents were properly caring for B.F. in an online chat in which Ms. Foley asked \nB.F. whether B.F. could keep herself safe when she was feeling down.  \n127.  Plaintiffs  Foote  and  Silvestri  are  informed  and  believe  and  based \nthereon  allege  that  throughout  April  and  May  2021,  Ms.  Foley  continued  to \nsurreptitiously  correspond  with  B.F.  via  online  chats  and  text  messages  and \ncontinued to affirm and applaud B.F.’s assertion of alternate genders and alternate \nnames, intentionally disregarding B.F.’s parents’ rights to direct their daughter’s \nmental health care and their explicit instructions that Baird Middle School staff was \nnot to engage in such conversations with their children.  \n128.  Ms. Foley’s continuing surreptitious meetings with B.F. and repeated \nquestioning of Plaintiffs’ decisions regarding B.F.’s care has interfered with and is \n31 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-30041-MGM   Document 22   Filed 06/21/22   Page 33 of 87\n \ninterfering with Plaintiffs’ exercise of their right to direct B.F.’s mental health care \nas well as disrupting the parent-child relationship. \n129.  On April 23, 2021, Mr. Foote received a card in the mail addressed to \n“R F****,” congratulating “R. F****,” Mr. Foote’s daughter B.F., for winning a \nbumper sticker contest put on by one of her teachers. The teacher enclosed an \nAmazon  Gift  Card  with  “Congratulations  R”  written  on  it,  demonstrating \nDefendants’  continuing  adherence  to  the  Protocol  and  blatant  disregard  for \nPlaintiffs’ parental rights.  \n130.  Defendants’  conduct  in  encouraging  young  students  to  conceal \nimportant  information  from  their  parents  and  undermining  parental  authority \nexplicitly and implicitly by openly questioning their parents’ decisions violates \nPlaintiffs’ fundamental parental rights to direct the upbringing of their children, \nmake mental health decisions for their children and protect family integrity and \nprivacy.  \n131.  As  to  Plaintiffs  Feliciano  and  Salmeron,  Defendants’  conduct  also \ninfringes on their sincerely held religious beliefs which include respect for parental \nauthority,  truthfulness,  and  adherence  to  a  Biblical  understanding  of  male  and \nfemale, commandment to honor one’s parents, and standards of behavior, all of \nwhich are disregarded in the Protocol.  \n32 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-30041-MGM   Document 22   Filed 06/21/22   Page 34 of 87\n \n132.  Because  the  intent  of  the  Protocol  is  to  conceal  information  from \nparents,  Plaintiffs  Feliciano  and  Salmeron  are  deliberately  hindered  from \nascertaining whether their children are being secretly socially transitioned, i.e., being \nprovided mental health treatment, without their knowledge or consent.  \n133.  Defendants and other staff in Ludlow Public Schools acting under the \nauthority and direction of Defendants Gazda, Nemeth, Monette, and the School \nCommittee acting as final policymaker for the Town have intentionally acted in \nreckless disregard of Plaintiffs’ rights to direct the upbringing and mental health care \nof their children and in direct contravention of Plaintiffs Foote and Silverstri’s \nexplicit  instructions  to  Defendant  Gazda,  Defendant  Monette,  the  School \nCommittee, and other Ludlow Public Schools staff.  \nDefendants’  Public  Ratification  of  the  Protocol  and  Derogation  of \nParental Rights \n134.  Members  of  Defendant  School  Committee  and  Mr.  Gazda  have \npublicly acknowledged and ratified the existence and continuing implementation of \nthe Protocol and its intentional and purposeful concealment of children’s mental \nhealth information from parents.  \n135.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe and based thereon allege that Ms. \nMonette terminated Ms. Manchester for failing to comply with the Protocol and \nrespecting the rights of B.F.’s parents by providing them information regarding their \n11-year-old  daughter’s  assertion  of  a  discordant  gender  identity,  further \n33 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-30041-MGM   Document 22   Filed 06/21/22   Page 35 of 87\n \ndemonstrating that the Protocol was an established procedure sanctioned by the \nSchool Committee acting as final policymaker for the Town and implemented by \nDistrict leadership.   \n136.  On May 25, 2021 during a School Committee public meeting, a tenth \ngrade student in Ludlow Public Schools submitted a public comment via email, \nwhich was the only participation vehicle that the School Committee provided for the \npublic meeting that was held in an empty meeting room.  \n137.  In the email read aloud during the meeting, the writer said that staff \nmembers were pushing extreme ideas to children 11 to 14 years old as part of an \nagenda aimed at “trying to convince children to change who they are and change \ntheir sexuality and gender at an age that many of them do not yet fully understand \nthe concepts of sexuality and gender.” The writer further stated that the School \nCommittee and staff were ignoring parents’ rights.  \n138.  After the email was read, Mr. Gazda read a prepared rebuttal. Mr. \nGazda did not dispute the District’s actions alleged in the statement, but instead \ndefended the conduct, saying the District’s actions were about  “inclusion” and \nmaking schools “safe” for children.  \n139.  Mr. Gazda’s statements imply that children are not “safe” with their \nparents. \n34 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-30041-MGM   Document 22   Filed 06/21/22   Page 36 of 87\n \n140.  Mr. Gazda also stated publicly what he had told Plaintiffs privately, i.e., \nthat the District’s actions (e.g., the Protocol) are “in compliance” with the laws and \nregulations of Massachusetts and DESE Guidance.  \n141.  Mr. Gazda further stated publicly, without refutation from the School \nCommittee, that parents’ concerns about the concealment of information amounted \nto “intolerance of LGBTQ people thinly veiled” behind a “camouflage of parental \nrights.”  \n142.  Mr. Gazda further stated that schools, not homes, are the true “safe \nspace” for children because schools supply “caring adults” where students can \ndiscuss problems and find support for their “true identities,” implying that children \ndo not receive such care from their parents. He said, “For many students school is \ntheir only safe place, and that safety evaporates when they leave the confines of our \nbuildings,” sending the message that safety is not to be found in their parents’ homes.  \n143.  Mr. Gazda said that the middle school would absolutely continue to \nhelp the children “express who they are” despite parents’ wishes to the contrary. \n144.  Defendant  School  Committee,  acting  as  final  policymaker  for  the \nTown, has condoned and facilitated the continued implementation of the Protocol, \nand in particular the intentional and blatant disregard for parental rights reflected in \nconcealing information from parents regarding their children’s gender-affirming \nsocial  transitioning  and  in  actively  deceiving  parents  by  directing  staff  to  use \n35 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-30041-MGM   Document 22   Filed 06/21/22   Page 37 of 87\n \nchildren’s given names and pronouns when speaking with parents but using the \nchild’s asserted preference for alternative names and pronouns at all other times.  \n145.  Defendant School Committee’s action and inaction have evidenced its \nadoption of the Protocol as de facto policy in public statements, including those at \nthe June 8, 2021 public meeting.  \n146.  After an emailed public comment from a group of parents was read \nduring  the  June  8,  2021  meeting,  then  Committee  Chairman  Michael  Kelliher \nrepeated Defendant Gazda’s claim that the District’s actions were “in compliance” \nwith state and federal laws. Mr. Kelliher defended the actions of district staff as \n“simply doing their jobs” of “being welcoming and supporting to the children.”  \n147.  Expressing  disdain  and  disregard  for  the  rights  of  Ludlow  Public \nSchool parents, Mr. Kelliher said that parents who were making their concerns \nknown to the Committee were opposing “inclusive policies of the Ludlow Public \nSchools” and were “under the spell” of “outside groups.”  \n148.  At the June 8, 2021 School Committee meeting Mr. Gazda further \nevidenced Defendants’ disdain and disregard for parental and religious exercise \nrights  by  characterizing  parents’  concerns  about  not  being  notified  and  their \ndecisions  not  being  honored  regarding  their  children’s  upbringing  and  gender \nidentity issues as “prejudice and bigotry.”   \n36 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-30041-MGM   Document 22   Filed 06/21/22   Page 38 of 87\n \n149.  No committee member has disagreed with or corrected Mr. Gazda’s \nand Mr. Kelliher’s public statements or otherwise refuted that the District’s accepted \nProtocol, i.e. de facto policy, was to conceal critical information regarding their \nchildren’s upbringing and mental health from parents and to disregard parents’ \ninstructions regarding their children’s assertion of a discordant gender identity.  \n150.  As parents of children who attend Ludlow Public Schools, all of the \nPlaintiffs  are  subjects  of  Defendants’  Protocol,  actions,  disdain,  and  attendant \nreckless disregard for their fundamental rights.  \n151.  So long as the Protocol remains in effect and is being implemented by \nDefendants, Plaintiffs continue to suffer deprivation of their fundamental parental \nrights to direct the upbringing of their children and particularly to direct the mental \nhealth care of their children.  \n152.  So long as the Protocol remains in place, Plaintiffs’ children are subject \nto surreptitious meetings, conversations, counseling sessions, online chats, and other \ncommunications with Ludlow Public Schools staff regarding and even promoting \nsocially transitioning to a discordant gender identity, a recognized form of mental \nhealth care, without the knowledge or consent of their parents.  \n153.  Plaintiffs’ parental rights continue to be violated by the Protocol’s \ninstructions that parents are to be deliberately deceived by staff who are directed to \nuse their child’s legal name and pronouns corresponding to their sex when speaking \n37 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-30041-MGM   Document 22   Filed 06/21/22   Page 39 of 87\n \nwith parents, but children’s preferred alternative names and pronouns at all other \ntimes in school-related communications.  \n154.  The  continuing  existence  and  implementation  of  the  Protocol  also \ninfringes on and violates Plaintiffs Feliciano’s and Salmeron’s rights to free exercise \nof religion in that their sincerely held religious beliefs require truthfulness in speech, \nobedience to parents, and that their children’s identities as being created male or \nfemale be respected regardless of contrary personal beliefs and ideologies of school \nstaff members.  \n155.  Defendants’ Protocol that affirms children’s desires to be called by an \nalternate gender discordant name and pronouns and actively promotes the idea that \nthey can socially transition to another gender involves significant mental health \ndecisions affecting children’s well-being with potentially life-long consequences. \nPursuant to the Protocol, these decisions are being made without the knowledge or \nconsent of parents. \n156.  Defendants  have  acted  with  reckless  disregard  for  the  rights  of \nPlaintiffs Foote and Silvestri as the parents of B.F. and G.F. and substituted their \njudgment for that of the parents in providing unauthorized mental health counseling \nand intervention without the knowledge or consent of B.F.’s and G.F.’s fit parents \n157.  Defendants have intentionally and purposefully disrupted Plaintiffs’ \nrelationships with their children, fostered distrust of parents, caused the children to \n38 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-30041-MGM   Document 22   Filed 06/21/22   Page 40 of 87\n \nquestion whether their parents can appropriately care for them and keep them safe, \nand otherwise irreparably harmed the parent-child relationship.  \n158.  In adopting and continuing to implement the Protocol, Defendants have \nsubstituted, and continue to substitute, their judgment for that of the parents in \ndirecting the upbringing and mental health care for the children of Ludlow Public \nSchools.  \n159.  Defendants’  actions  and  public  statements  evidence  a  reckless \ndisregard and disdain for the fundamental rights of Plaintiffs regarding decision-\nmaking related to children’s assertion of a discordant gender identity and request to \nsocially transition, a recognized mental health treatment.  \n160.  Defendants’  reckless  disregard  for  the  rights  of  Plaintiffs  has \nimpermissibly supplanted the rights of the parents to make mental health decisions \nand direct the upbringing of their children, interfered with the privacy rights of the \nfamily, created uncertainty and distrust between parents and children and between \nparents and educators, and threatened religious free exercise rights.  \n161.  Unless and until Defendants, inter alia, a) publicly rescind the Protocol, \nb) cease communicating to and instructing Ludlow Public School staff that parents \nare not to be notified, c) publicly establish a policy that parents will be notified when \nchildren raise issues related to their mental health and discordant gender identity, d) \ncease meeting with children to provide counsel, advice and advocacy related to \n39 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-30041-MGM   Document 22   Filed 06/21/22   Page 41 of 87\n \nmental health and discordant gender identity without parental notice and consent,  e) \ncease  deceiving  parents  by  using  one  set  of  names  and  pronouns  when \ncommunicating  with  them  and  another  at  school,  and  f)  abide  by  parents’ \ninstructions concerning their child’s mental health treatment and assertion of a \ndiscordant gender identity,  Plaintiffs’ fundamental rights to direct the upbringing of \ntheir children, to make decisions regarding their children’s medical and mental \nhealth, right of familial privacy, and free exercise rights will continue to be violated.   \n162.  Defendants’  ongoing  violations  of  Plaintiffs’  fundamental  parental \nrights have caused and will continue to cause irreparable harm unless and until \ndiscontinued.  \nFIRST CAUSE OF ACTION \nVIOLATION OF CIVIL RIGHTS, 42 U.S.C. § 1983 \n(Violation of Plaintiffs’ Substantive Due Process Fundamental Parental \nRight to Direct the Education and Upbringing of Their Children under \nthe U.S. Constitution) \n(By All Plaintiffs Against all Defendants) \n \n163.  Plaintiffs incorporate the preceding factual allegations in paragraphs 9-\n162 by reference as if set forth in full.  \n164.  The Due Process Clause in the 14th Amendment to the United States \nConstitution protects the fundamental right of parents to direct the upbringing, care, \ncustody, and control of their children. Pierce v. Society of Sisters, 268 U.S. 510 \n(1925); Troxel v. Granville, 530 U.S. 57, 68 (2000)  \n40 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-30041-MGM   Document 22   Filed 06/21/22   Page 42 of 87\n \n165.  Defendants  have  violated  and  are  continuing  to  violate  Plaintiffs’ \nfundamental right to make decisions regarding the upbringing, custody, care, and \ncontrol of their children in establishing and implementing the Protocol that prohibits \ninforming  parents  regarding  their  children’s  assertions  regarding  gender  non-\nconformity, transgender status and attendant requests to affirm alternate identities \nunless their minor children of any age consent.  \n166.  Defendants have acted and are continuing to act with reckless disregard \nfor  Plaintiffs’  fundamental  parental  rights  by  purposefully  and  intentionally \nconcealing critical information and decisions regarding the upbringing and care of \ntheir children, i.e., that the children are asserting a discordant gender identity, that \nthe children have requested to be addressed by an opposite sex name and pronouns \nand  other  information  and  decisions  associated  with  affirming  the  children’s \nassertions.  \n167.  Defendants  have  acted  and  are  acting  with  reckless  disregard  for \nPlaintiffs’ fundamental parental rights in a manner that shocks the conscience as \ndescribed infra.  \nAllegations Regarding School Committee and Town \n168.  Defendant  School  Committee  acting  as  final  policymaker  for \nDefendant Town has acted and is continuing to act with reckless disregard for \nPlaintiffs’ fundamental parental rights in a manner that shocks the conscience in that \n41 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-30041-MGM   Document 22   Filed 06/21/22   Page 43 of 87\n \na) the School Committee knows that the DESE Guidance is not a legal mandate, but \nclaims that it requires that school staff conceal information from parents; b) the \nSchool Committee knows that the DESE Guidance suggests only that school staff \nshould speak to students before speaking to parents, but claims that it supports \nDefendant’s  Protocol  that  parents  are  not  to  be  told  about  children’s  social \ntransitioning unless the child consents; c) the School Committee knows that under \nMassachusetts law parents have sole control and access to information in their \nchild’s records until the child is age 14 or in the ninth grade, but authorizes and \nsanctions the deliberate concealment of information from parents of children under \nage 14 unless the child consents; and d) the School Committee knows that under \nMassachusetts law parents must be informed of and consent to medical/mental \nhealth care for their children who are under 18, but have approved and implemented \na Protocol that directs staff to encourage, facilitate, develop and implement gender-\naffirming social transitioning, a known mental health treatment, with children under \nage 18  without informing or gaining consent from parents.  \nAllegations Against Defendant Gazda  \n169.  Defendant  Gazda,  as  superintendent  charged  with  implementing \npolicies sanctioned by the School Committee through June 2021, acted with reckless \ndisregard for Plaintiffs’ fundamental parental rights in a manner that shocks the \nconscience in that a) Mr. Gazda knew that the DESE Guidance is not a legal mandate \n42 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-30041-MGM   Document 22   Filed 06/21/22   Page 44 of 87\n \nbut claimed that it requires that school staff conceal information from parents; b) \nMr. Gazda knew that the DESE Guidance suggests only that school staff should \nspeak to students before speaking to parents, but claimed that it supports Defendants’ \nProtocol that parents are not to be told about children’s gender-affirming social \ntransitioning unless the child consents; c) Mr. Gazda knew that under Massachusetts \nlaw parents have sole control and access to information in their child’s records until \nthe child is age 14 or in the ninth grade, but authorized and directed school staff to \ndeliberately conceal information from parents of children under age 14 unless the \nchild consents; and d) Mr. Gazda knew that under Massachusetts law, parents must \nbe informed of and consent to medical/mental health care for their children who are \nunder 18, but approved and implemented a Protocol that directs staff to encourage, \nfacilitate, develop and implement gender-affirming social transitioning, a known \nmental health treatment, with children under age 18  without informing or obtaining \nconsent from parents.  \n170.  Defendant  Gazda,  as  superintendent  charged  with  implementing \npolicies  sanctioned  by  the  School  Committee,  through  June  2021,  acted  with \nreckless disregard for Plaintiffs’ fundamental parental rights in a manner that shocks \nthe  conscience in that  Mr.  Gazda knew  that  Plaintiffs  Foote  and  Silvestri had \nexercised their parental rights to direct the upbringing of their children by securing \na private therapist for B.F. and requested that school staff not engage with their \n43 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-30041-MGM   Document 22   Filed 06/21/22   Page 45 of 87\n \nchildren regarding mental health issues. Nevertheless, Defendant Gazda failed to \nadequately supervise and train employees to not implement the Protocol or actively \nencouraged  employees  to  implement  the  Protocol  and  engage  with  Plaintiffs’ \nchildren without notifying Plaintiffs. \n171.  Defendant  Gazda  acted  with  reckless  disregard  for  Plaintiffs’ \nfundamental parental rights in a manner that shocks the conscience in that Mr. Gazda \npublicly stated during School Committee meetings that parents with concerns about \nnot being notified and their decisions not being honored regarding their children’s \ngender identity issues (i.e., upbringing) were driven by “prejudice and bigotry,” and  \n“under the spell” of “outside groups,” and that school officials would continue with \ntheir policies regardless of what parents thought.  \nAllegations Against Defendant Nemeth \n172.  Defendant  Nemeth,  as  interim  superintendent  charged  with \nimplementing policies sanctioned by the School Committee, since June 2021, has \nacted and is acting with reckless disregard for Plaintiffs’ fundamental parental rights \nin a manner that shocks the conscience in that a) Ms. Nemeth knows that the DESE \nGuidance is not a legal mandate, but claims that it requires that school staff conceal \ninformation from parents; b) Ms. Nemeth knows that the DESE Guidance suggests \nonly that school staff should speak to students before speaking to parents, but claims \nthat it supports Defendants’ Protocol that parents are not to be told about children’s \n44 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-30041-MGM   Document 22   Filed 06/21/22   Page 46 of 87\n \ngender-affirming  social  transitioning  unless  the  child  consents;  c)  Ms.  Nemeth \nknows  that  under  Massachusetts  law  parents  have  sole  control  and  access  to \ninformation in their child’s records until the child is age 14 or in the ninth grade, but \nnonetheless authorizes and directs school staff to deliberately conceal information \nfrom parents of children under age 14 unless the child consents; d) Ms. Nemeth \nknows that under Massachusetts law parents must be informed of and consent to \nmedical/mental health care for their children who are under 18, but implements a \nProtocol that directs staff to encourage, facilitate, develop and implement gender-\naffirming social transitioning, a known mental health treatment, with children under \nage 18  without informing or obtaining consent from parents.  \nAllegations Against Defendant Monette \n173.  Defendant Monette, as principal of Baird Middle School charged with  \nimplementing policies sanctioned by the School Committee at the school, has acted \nwith reckless disregard for Plaintiffs’ fundamental parental rights in a manner that \nshocks the conscience in that a) Ms. Monette knew or should have known that the \nDESE Guidance is not a legal mandate, but claimed that it requires that school staff \nconceal information from parents; b) Ms. Monette knew or should have known that \nthe DESE Guidance suggests only that school staff should speak to students before \nspeaking to parents, but claimed that it supports Defendants’ Protocol that parents \nare not to be told about children’s gender-affirming social transitioning unless the \n45 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-30041-MGM   Document 22   Filed 06/21/22   Page 47 of 87\n \nchild  consents;  c)  Ms.  Monette  knew  or  should  have  known  that  under \nMassachusetts law parents have sole control and access to information in their \nchild’s records until the  child is age 14 or in the ninth grade, but nonetheless \nauthorized and directed school staff to deliberately conceal information from parents \nof children under age 14 unless the child consents; d) Ms. Monette knew or should \nhave known that under Massachusetts law parents must be informed of and consent \nto medical/mental health care for their children who are under 18, but implemented \na Protocol that directs staff to encourage, facilitate, develop and implement gender-\naffirming social transitioning, a known mental health treatment, with children under \nage 18  without informing or obtaining consent from parents.  \n174.  Defendant Monette as principal of Baird Middle School acted with \nreckless disregard for Plaintiffs’ fundamental parental rights in a manner that shocks \nthe conscience in that Ms. Monette knew that Plaintiffs Foote and Silvestri had \nexercised their parental rights to direct the upbringing of their children by securing \na private therapist for B.F. and requested that school staff not engage with their \nchildren regarding mental health issues. Nevertheless, Defendant Monette but failed \nto  adequately  supervise  and  train  employees  to  not implement the  Protocol  or \nactively  encouraged  employees  to  implement  the  Protocol  and  engage  with \nPlaintiffs’ children without notifying Plaintiffs. \n \n46 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-30041-MGM   Document 22   Filed 06/21/22   Page 48 of 87\n \nAllegations Against Defendant Foley \n175.  Defendant Foley, as school counselor at Baird Middle School, has acted \nand continues to act with reckless disregard for Plaintiffs’ fundamental parental \nrights in a manner that shocks the conscience in that a) Ms. Foley knows or should \nhave known that the DESE Guidance is not a legal mandate, but claims that it \nrequires that school staff conceal information from parents; b) Ms. Foley knows or \nshould have known that the DESE Guidance suggests only that school staff should \nspeak to students before speaking to parents, but claims that it supports Defendants’ \nProtocol that parents are not to be told about children’s gender-affirming social \ntransitioning unless the child consents; c) Ms. Foley knows or should have known \nthat under Massachusetts law parents have sole control and access to information in \ntheir child’s records until the child is age 14 or in the ninth grade, but deliberately \nconcealed information and authorized and directed others to deliberately conceal \ninformation from parents of children under age 14 unless the child consents; d) Ms. \nFoley knows or should have known that under Massachusetts law parents must be \ninformed of and consent to medical/mental health care for their children who are \nunder 18, but encouraged, facilitated, developed and implemented gender-affirming \nsocial transitioning, a known mental health treatment, with children under age 18  \nwithout informing or obtaining consent from parents; e) Ms. Foley knows or should \nhave known that under Massachusetts law parents have sole control over their \n47 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-30041-MGM   Document 22   Filed 06/21/22   Page 49 of 87\n \nchildren’s information until children are 14 years old or in grade nine and that \nparents must consent to mental health treatment for their children, but advised and \ninstructed Baird Middle School staff that the law did not require that staff provide \ninformation related to gender identity to parents of children under age 14.   \n176.  Defendant Foley acted and continues to act with reckless disregard for \nPlaintiffs’ fundamental parental rights in a manner that shocks the conscience in that \nMs. Foley knew that Plaintiffs Foote and Silvestri had exercised their parental rights \nto direct the upbringing of their children by securing a private therapist for B.F. and \nrequested that school staff not engage with their children regarding mental health \nissues, but actively engaged with B.F. regarding her mental health issues related to \na discordant gender identity without notifying Plaintiffs. \n177.  Defendant Foley acted and continues to act with reckless disregard for \nPlaintiffs’ fundamental parental rights in a manner that shocks the conscience in that \nMs. Foley knew that Plaintiffs Foote and Silvestri had exercised their parental rights \nto direct the upbringing of their children by securing a private therapist for B.F. and \nrequested that staff not engage with their children, but actively and intentionally \ndefied the parents’ instructions by soliciting and participating in private meetings \nwith B.F. and questioning whether B.F.’s parents could keep her safe or provide \nproper therapeutic care.  \n48 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-30041-MGM   Document 22   Filed 06/21/22   Page 50 of 87\n \n178.  Defendant Foley acted and continues to act with reckless disregard for \nPlaintiffs’ fundamental parental rights in a manner that shocks the conscience in that \nMs. Foley knew that Plaintiffs Foote and Silvestri had exercised their parental rights \nto direct the upbringing of their children by securing a private therapist for B.F. and \nrequested that staff not engage with their children, but actively and intentionally \ndefied the parents’ instructions by soliciting and participating in private meetings \nwith B.F. and referring B.F. to Defendant Funke for private meetings aimed at \nfacilitating and promoting social transitioning to a discordant gender identity without \nthe knowledge and consent of her parents. \nAllegations Against Defendant Funke \n179.  Defendant Funke, when school librarian at Baird Middle School, acted \nwith reckless disregard for Plaintiffs’ fundamental parental rights in a manner that \nshocks the conscience in that a) Ms. Funke knew or should have known that the \nDESE Guidance is not a legal mandate but claimed that it requires that school staff \nconceal information from parents; b) Ms. Funke knew or should have known that \nthe DESE Guidance suggests only that school staff should speak to students before \nspeaking to parents, but claimed that it supports Defendants’ Protocol that parents \nare not to be told about children’s gender-affirming social transitioning unless the \nchild consents; c) Ms. Funke knew or should have known that under Massachusetts \nlaw parents have sole control and access to information in their child’s records until \n49 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-30041-MGM   Document 22   Filed 06/21/22   Page 51 of 87\n \nthe child is age 14 or in the ninth grade, but deliberately concealed information and \ndirected others to deliberately conceal information from parents of children under \nage 14 unless the child consents; d) Ms. Funke knew or should have known that \nunder Massachusetts law parents must be informed of and consent to medical/mental \nhealth  care  for  their  children  who  are  under  18,  but  nonetheless  encouraged, \nfacilitated,  promoted  and  implemented  gender-affirming  social  transitioning,  a \nknown mental health treatment, with children under age 18  without informing or \ngaining consent from parents.  \n180.  Defendant  Funke  acted  with  reckless  disregard  for  Plaintiffs’ \nfundamental parental rights in a manner that shocks the conscience in that Ms. Funke \nknew or should have known that Plaintiffs Foote and Silvestri had exercised their \nparental  rights  to  direct  the  upbringing of  their  children  by  securing  a  private \ntherapist for B.F. and requested that school staff not engage with their children \nregarding mental health issues, but actively engaged with B.F. regarding gender-\naffirming social transitioning without Plaintiffs’ consent. \n181.  Defendant  Funke  acted  with  reckless  disregard  for  Plaintiffs’ \nfundamental parental rights in a manner that shocks the conscience in that Ms. Funke \nactively defied the parents’ instructions by meeting privately with B.F. and G.F. and \npromoting  social  transitioning  through  private  meetings  and  conversations, \nrecommendation of and referral to advocacy-driven sites, materials and activities to \n50 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-30041-MGM   Document 22   Filed 06/21/22   Page 52 of 87\n \nexperiment with discordant gender identities and socially transition without the \nknowledge and consent of their parents.  \nGeneral Allegations \n182.  By approving and implementing the Protocol, all Defendants have and \nare  explicitly  and  intentionally  excluding  Plaintiffs  from  significant  decision-\nmaking directly related to their children’s upbringing and care in a manner that \nDefendants know to be contrary to law.  \n183.  Defendants’ reckless disregard for Plaintiffs’ rights has resulted in and \nis resulting in deprivation of their fundamental constitutional rights.  \n184.  Plaintiffs’ constitutionally protected right to direct the upbringing of \ntheir  children was violated  as the  plainly  obvious  consequence of Defendants’ \nactions  in  intentionally  and  explicitly  concealing  information  and  purposefully \ndeceiving Plaintiffs in accordance with and through implementation of the Protocol.   \n185.  Plaintiffs’ constitutionally protected right to direct the upbringing of \ntheir  children was violated  as the  plainly  obvious  consequence of Defendants’ \nactions in, inter alia,  a) meeting secretly with their children to engage in counseling \nand  advocacy  related  to  mental  health  and  discordant  gender  identity  without \nparental notice and consent, b) deceiving parents by using one set of names and \npronouns  when  communicating  with  them  and  another  at  school,  c)  directing \nchildren to speak untruthfully by instructing them to use alternate gender pronouns \n51 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-30041-MGM   Document 22   Filed 06/21/22   Page 53 of 87\n \nand names for their peers, d) actively defying Plaintiffs’ explicit instructions to not \nengage in mental health discussions with their children, e) actively and intentionally \nnurturing distrust for parents through secret meetings in which parents’ decisions \nand ability to act in the best interest of their children are questioned, and f) publicly \ndismissing and demeaning parents’ challenges to the Protocol as “bigotry”  driven \nby outside groups and pledging to continue to defy parental rights.  \n186.  Defendants  cannot  assert  a  compelling  interest  for  disregarding \nPlaintiffs’ long-established fundamental constitutional right to direct the upbringing, \ncare,  and  custody  of  their  children,  and  Defendants’  protocol  and  actions  in \nfurtherance thereof is not narrowly tailored.  \n187.  Defendants’ violation of Plaintiffs’ fundamental constitutional rights \nhas caused and continues to cause Plaintiffs undue hardship and irreparable harm.  \n188.  Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law to correct the continuing \ndeprivation of their fundamental rights.  \nSECOND CAUSE OF ACTION \nVIOLATION OF CIVIL RIGHTS, 42 U.S.C. § 1983 \n(Violation of Plaintiffs’ Fundamental Parental Right to Direct the Medical \nand Mental Health Decision-making for Their Children Under the U.S. \nConstitution) \n(By All Plaintiffs Against all Defendants) \n \n189.

Defendant Monette, as principal of Baird Middle School charged with  \nimplementing policies sanctioned by the School Committee at the school, has acted \nwith reckless disregard for Plaintiffs’ fundamental  right to familial privacy in a \nmanner that shocks the conscience in that a) Ms. Monette knew or should have \nknown that the DESE Guidance is not a legal mandate but claimed that it requires \nthat school staff conceal information from parents; b) Ms. Monette knew or should \nhave known that the DESE Guidance suggests only that school staff should speak to \nstudents before speaking to parents, but claimed that it permits the reversal of parent \nand child roles by providing that parents are not to be told about children’s gender-\naffirming social transitioning unless the child consents; c) Ms. Monette knew or \nshould have known that under Massachusetts law parents have sole control and \naccess to information in their child’s records until the child is age 14 or in the ninth \ngrade, but directed school staff to deliberately conceal information from parents of \n72 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-30041-MGM   Document 22   Filed 06/21/22   Page 74 of 87\n \nchildren under age 14 unless the child consents; d) Ms. Monette knew or should have \nknown that under Massachusetts law parents must be informed of and consent to \nmedical/mental health care for their children who are under 18, but implemented a \nProtocol that directs staff to encourage, facilitate, promote and implement gender-\naffirming social transitioning, a known mental health treatment, with children under \nage 18  without informing or gaining consent from parents.   \n234.  Defendant Monette as principal of Baird Middle School acted with \nreckless disregard for Plaintiffs’ fundamental  right to familial privacy in a manner \nthat shocks the conscience in that Ms. Monette knew that Plaintiffs Foote and \nSilvestri had exercised their rights as parents to provide mental health care through \na private therapist and requested that school staff respect their rights and not engage \nwith their children, but failed to adequately supervise and train employees to not \nimplement  the  Protocol  or  actively  encouraged  employees  to  defy  Plaintiffs’ \ndirections and engage with Plaintiffs’ children without notifying Plaintiffs. \nAllegations Against Defendant Foley \n235.  Defendant Foley, as school counselor at Baird Middle School, has acted \nand continues act with reckless disregard for Plaintiffs’ fundamental right to family \nprivacy in a manner that shocks the conscience in that a) Ms. Foley knows or should \nhave known that the DESE Guidance is not a legal mandate but claims that it requires \nthat school staff conceal information from parents; b) Ms. Foley knows or should \n73 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-30041-MGM   Document 22   Filed 06/21/22   Page 75 of 87\n \nhave known that the DESE Guidance suggests only that school staff should speak to \nstudents before speaking to parents, but claims that it permits the reversal of parent \nand child roles by providing that parents are not to be told about children’s gender-\naffirming social transitioning unless the child consents; c) Ms. Foley knows or \nshould have known that under Massachusetts law parents have sole control and \naccess to information in their child’s records until the child is age 14 or in the ninth \ngrade, but deliberately concealed information and directed others to deliberately \nconceal information from parents of children under age 14 unless the child consents; \nd) Ms. Foley knows or should have known that under Massachusetts law parents \nmust be informed of and consent to medical/mental health care for their children \nwho are under 18, but encouraged, facilitated, promoted and implemented gender-\naffirming social transitioning, a known mental health treatment, with children under \nage 18  without informing or gaining consent from parents.  \n236.  Defendant Foley acted and continues to act with reckless disregard for \nPlaintiffs’  fundamental    right  to  familial  privacy  in  a  manner  that  shocks  the \nconscience in that Ms. Foley knew that Plaintiffs Foote and Silvestri had exercised \ntheir rights as parents to provide mental health care through a private therapist and \nrequested that school staff respect their rights and not engage with their children on \nthese  matters,  but  intentionally  defied  Plaintiffs’  directions  and  engaged  with \n74 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-30041-MGM   Document 22   Filed 06/21/22   Page 76 of 87\n \nPlaintiffs’ children without notifying Plaintiffs, thereby inserting herself into the \nfamily dynamic in violation of Plaintiffs’ right to family privacy. \n237.  Defendant Foley acted and continues to act with reckless disregard for \nPlaintiffs’  fundamental    right  to  familial  privacy  in  a  manner  that  shocks  the \nconscience in that Ms. Foley knew that Plaintiffs Foote and Silvestri had exercised \ntheir rights as parents to provide mental health care through a private therapist and \nrequested that school staff respect their rights and not engage with their children on \nthese  matters,  but  actively  defied  the  parents’  instructions  by  soliciting  and \nparticipating in private meetings with B.F. and questioning whether B.F.’s parents \ncould keep her safe or provide proper therapeutic care.  \n238.  Defendant Foley acted and continues to act with reckless disregard for \nPlaintiffs’ fundamental parental rights in a manner that shocks the conscience in that \nMs. Foley knew that Plaintiffs Foote and Silvestri had exercised their rights as \nparents to provide mental health care through a private therapist and requested that \nschool staff respect their rights and not engage with their children on these matters, \nbut actively defied the parents’ instructions by referring B.F. to Defendant Funke for \nprivate  meetings  aimed  at  facilitating  and  promoting  gender-affirming  social \ntransitioning to a discordant gender identity without the knowledge and consent of \nher parents. \n \n75 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-30041-MGM   Document 22   Filed 06/21/22   Page 77 of 87\n \nAllegations Against Defendant Funke \n239.  Defendant Funke, when school librarian at Baird Middle School, acted \nwith reckless disregard for Plaintiffs’ fundamental right to familial privacy in a \nmanner that shocks the conscience in that a) Ms. Funke knew or should have known \nthat the DESE Guidance is not a legal mandate but claimed that it requires that school \nstaff conceal information from parents; b) Ms. Funke knew or should have known \nthat the DESE Guidance suggests only that school staff should speak to students \nbefore speaking to parents, but claimed that it permits the reversal of parent and child \nroles by providing that parents are not to be told about children’s gender-affirming \nsocial transitioning unless the child consents; c) Ms. Funke knew or should have \nknown  that  under  Massachusetts  law  parents  have  sole  control  and  access  to \ninformation in their child’s records until the child is age 14 or in the ninth grade, but \ndeliberately  concealed  information  and  directed  others  to  deliberately  conceal \ninformation from parents of children under age 14 unless the child consents; d) Ms. \nFunke knew or should have known that under Massachusetts law parents must be \ninformed of and consent to medical/mental health care for their children who are \nunder 18, but encouraged, facilitated, promoted and implemented gender-affirming \nsocial transitioning, a known mental health treatment, with children under age 18  \nwithout informing or gaining consent from parents.  \n76 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-30041-MGM   Document 22   Filed 06/21/22   Page 78 of 87\n \n240.  Defendant  Funke  acted  with  reckless  disregard  for  Plaintiffs’ \nfundamental right to family privacy in a manner that shocks the conscience in that \nMs. Funke knew or should have known that Plaintiffs Foote and Silvestri had \nexercised their parental rights by securing a private therapist for B.F. and  requested \nthat school staff not engage with their children regarding mental health issues, but \nactively engaged with B.F. regarding gender-affirming social transitioning without \nPlaintiffs’ consent thereby impermissibly inserting herself into the Plaintiffs’ family \ndynamic. \n241.  Defendant  Funke  acted  with  reckless  disregard  for  Plaintiffs’ \nfundamental right to family privacy in a manner that shocks the conscience in that \nMs. Funke actively defied the parents’ instructions by meeting privately with B.F. \nand G.F. and encouraging them through conversations, materials, internet sites, and \nrecommended activities to experiment with discordant gender identities and socially \ntransition without the knowledge and consent of their parents.  \nGeneral Allegations \n242.  Defendants’ deliberate indifference to Plaintiffs’ rights has resulted in \nand continues to result in deprivation of their constitutional rights to family privacy.  \n243.  Plaintiffs’  constitutionally  protected  rights  to  family  privacy  were \nviolated as the plainly obvious consequence of Defendants’ actions in intentionally \nand explicitly withholding information in accordance with the Protocol that parents \n77 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-30041-MGM   Document 22   Filed 06/21/22   Page 79 of 87\n \nwere not to be notified when their children assert a discordant gender identity and \nseek to socially transition unless the children consent.   \n244.  Plaintiffs’  constitutionally  protected  right  to  family  privacy  was \nviolated as the plainly obvious consequence of Defendants’ actions in, inter alia,  a) \nmeeting secretly with their children to engage in counseling and ideologically-driven \nadvocacy related to mental health and discordant gender identity without parental \nnotice and consent, b) deceiving parents by using one set of names and pronouns \nwhen communicating with them and another at school, c) directing children to speak \nuntruthfully by instructing them to use alternate gender pronouns and names for their \npeers, and d) nurturing distrust for parents through secret meetings in which parents’ \ndecisions and ability to act in the best interest of their children are questioned, thus \ndisrupting the parent-child relationship.  \n245.  Defendants  cannot  assert  a  compelling  state  interest  for  recklessly \ndisregarding Plaintiffs’ constitutional rights to family privacy. \n246.  Defendants’ prohibitions against parental notification and unauthorized \ninvolvement in children’s mental health decisions related to gender identity are not \nnarrowly tailored.  \n247.  Defendants’ violation of Plaintiffs’ constitutional rights has caused and \ncontinues to cause Plaintiffs undue hardship and irreparable harm in that Plaintiffs \nhave  been  and  are  being  denied  their  right  to  direct  decisions  concerning  the \n78 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-30041-MGM   Document 22   Filed 06/21/22   Page 80 of 87\n \nupbringing and mental health care for their children without interference from the \nstate, and their children are denied the right to have upbringing and mental health \ndecisions made by their parents in keeping with their family values, advice of the \nfamily’s mental health professionals, and their sincerely held religious beliefs.   \n248.  Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law to correct the continuing \ndeprivation of their fundamental rights. \nFOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION \nViolation of Civil Rights, 42 U.S.C.  § 1983 \n(Violation of Plaintiffs’ Right to Free Exercise of Religion Under the U.S. \nConstitution) \n(By Plaintiffs Feliciano and Salmeron Against all Defendants) \n249.  Plaintiffs incorporate the factual allegations in paragraphs 9-162 by \nreference as if set forth in full.   \n250.  The Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment to the United States \nConstitution,  as  applied  to  the  states  by  the  Fourteenth  Amendment,  prohibits \nDefendants from abridging Plaintiffs’ right to free exercise of religion.  \n251.  Plaintiffs have sincerely held Biblically-based religious beliefs that \nhuman beings are created male or female and that the natural created order regarding \nhuman sexuality cannot be changed regardless of individual feelings, beliefs, or \ndiscomfort with one’s identity, and biological reality, as either male or female.  \n252.  Plaintiffs have Biblically-based sincerely held religious beliefs that \nparents have the non-delegable duty to direct the upbringing and beliefs, religious \n79 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-30041-MGM   Document 22   Filed 06/21/22   Page 81 of 87\n \ntraining, and medical and mental health care of their children, that children are to \nrespect their parents’ authority, and that any intrusion of the government into that \nrealm infringes upon the free exercise of their religion.  \n253.  Plaintiffs have sincerely held Biblically-based religious beliefs that all \npeople  are  to  be  treated  with  respect  and  compassion,  and  that  respect  and \ncompassion do not include misrepresenting an individual’s natural created identity \nas either a male or a female. \n254.  Plaintiffs have sincerely held religious beliefs that individuals are to \nspeak the truth, including speaking the truth regarding matters of sexual identity as \na male or female.  \n255.  Defendants’ actions in excluding Plaintiffs Feliciano and Salmeron \nfrom decision making regarding their children’s sexual and gender identity target \nthe Plaintiffs’ beliefs regarding the created order, human nature, sexuality, gender, \nparental  authority,  and  morality  which  constitute  central  components  of  their \nsincerely held religious beliefs.  \n256.  Defendants’ actions have caused a direct and immediate conflict with \nPlaintiffs’ religious beliefs by prohibiting them from being informed of mental \nhealth issues their children are or might be experiencing and by denying them the \nopportunity to seek counseling and guidance for their children in a manner that is \nconsistent with the beliefs sincerely held by their family instead of the government.  \n80 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-30041-MGM   Document 22   Filed 06/21/22   Page 82 of 87\n \n257.  Defendants’  actions  are  coercive  in  that  they  deliberately  supplant \nPlaintiffs’ role as advisors of the moral and religious development of their children \nso that they are not able to direct their children’s mental health care,  counseling, and \nbeliefs regarding sex and gender identity in accordance with their values because \nDefendants have substituted and supplanted the state’s perspective on the issues of \nsex and gender identity for the perspective of Plaintiffs in violation of Plaintiffs’ free \nexercise rights.  \n258.  Defendants’ actions are neither neutral nor generally applicable, but \nrather, specifically and discriminatorily target the religious speech, beliefs, and \nviewpoint  of  Plaintiffs  and,  thus,  expressly  constitute  a  substantial  burden  on \nsincerely held religious beliefs that are contrary to Defendants’ viewpoint regarding \ngender identity and affirmation of a discordant gender identity.  \n259.  No  compelling  state  interest justifies the  burdens  Defendants  have \nimposed and are imposing on Plaintiffs’ rights to the free exercise of religion.  \n260.  Defendants’ actions are not the least restrictive means to accomplish \nany permissible government purpose Defendants seek to serve.  \n261.  Defendants’ violation of Plaintiffs’ rights to free exercise of religion \nhas caused, is causing, and will continue to cause Plaintiffs to suffer undue and actual \nhardships.  \n81 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-30041-MGM   Document 22   Filed 06/21/22   Page 83 of 87\n \n262.  Defendants’ violation of Plaintiffs’ rights to free exercise of religion \nhas caused, is causing, and will continue to cause Plaintiffs to suffer irreparable \ninjury.  Plaintiffs  have  no  adequate  remedy  at  law  to  correct  the  continuing \ndeprivation of their most cherished constitutional liberties. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs request the following relief: \n1.  A declaration that Defendants have violated Plaintiffs’ fundamental rights \nas parents, under the United States Constitution and other laws to the extent that \nthey: a) have approved and implemented a Protocol to conceal from parents when \ntheir  children  express  a  discordant  gender  identity  and  are  being  socially \ntransitioned, unless the children consent; b) actively implement and reinforce the \nProtocol  through  surreptitious  meetings  with  minor  children  to  discuss  gender \nidentity, socially transition, and promote experimenting with alternative gender \nidentities  without  the  knowledge  or  consent  of  their  parents;  c)  actively  and \nintentionally nurture in children distrust of their parents by questioning the parents’ \ncare for their children during secret meetings of which the parents are not aware nor \nconsent to; and d) actively and intentionally direct school staff to deceive parents by \nusing given names and pronouns in communications with parents but otherwise \naffirming a minor child’s preferred gender discordant name and pronouns.  \n82 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-30041-MGM   Document 22   Filed 06/21/22   Page 84 of 87\n \n2.

A declaration that the Protocol and any associated policies, procedures, \nand practices are to be publicly rescinded and that parents be notified that the \nProtocol and associated policies and procedures have been rescinded.  \n4.  Preliminary  and  permanent  injunctions  prohibiting  Defendants,  their \nemployees,  agents  and  third  parties  acting  at  their  direction,  from:  a)  Using, \nreferencing, relying on, or otherwise acting upon the Protocol and associated policies \nand  procedures  fostering  secrecy  from  parents  as  guidance  for  Ludlow  Public \nSchools’  staff  and  administrators;  b)    Training  staff  to  exclude  parents  from \ndiscussions, meetings, and other interventions with the parents’ children related to \ntheir children’s assertion of a discordant gender identity and desire to socially \ntransition; c) Failing to notify parents when their children express the belief that they \nhave a discordant gender identity and want to take actions to affirm that identify; d) \nFailing or refusing to abide by parents’ instructions concerning their children’s \ndiscordant gender identity; e) Meeting with children to discuss, promote, or engage \n83 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-30041-MGM   Document 22   Filed 06/21/22   Page 85 of 87\n \nin  counseling  regarding  the children’s  discordant  gender identity  and  desire to \nsocially transition without notice to and the consent of their parents.  \n5.

No. 25)  \n  \nDecember 14, 2022 \n \n \nMASTROIANNI, U.S.D.J.  \n \nI.  INTRODUCTION \nStephen Foote and Marissa Silvestri (“Plaintiffs”) have alleged that during the 2020-2021 \nschool year, staff employed by Ludlow Public Schools (1) spoke about gender identity with two of \ntheir children, who were then eleven and twelve years old and students at Baird Middle School; (2) \ncomplied with the children’s requests to use alternative names and pronouns; and (3) did not share \ninformation with Plaintiffs about the children’s expressed preferences regarding their names and \npronouns. Plaintiffs allege these actions, and inactions, violated their fundamental, parental rights \nprotected by the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. They filed this action \npursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 to seek redress for their alleged injuries.  \nPlaintiffs assert three claims against the Town of Ludlow; the Ludlow School Committee; \nLisa Nemeth, Interim Superintendent; Todd Gazda, former Superintendent; Stacy Monette, \nPrincipal of Baird Middle School; Marie-Claire Foley, school counselor at Baird Middle School; and \n\nCase 3:22-cv-30041-MGM   Document 51   Filed 12/14/22   Page 2 of 19\nJordan Funke, former librarian at Baird Middle School (collectively “Defendants”). First, they allege \nDefendants violated their fundamental parental right to direct the education and upbringing of their \nchildren. Second, they allege Defendants violated their fundamental parental right to direct the \nmedical and mental health decision-making for their children. Finally, they assert Defendants \nviolated their fundamental right to familial privacy.  \nDefendants have moved for dismissal of Plaintiffs’ claims.1 The court grants Defendants’ \nmotion for the reasons that follow.   \n \nII.  MOTION TO DISMISS STANDARD \n  “To survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted \nas true, to ‘state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.’” Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 \n(2009) (quoting Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007)); Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). \n“Determining whether a complaint states a plausible claim for relief will . . . be a context-specific \ntask that requires the reviewing court to draw on its judicial experience and common sense.” Id. at \n679. The court accepts all well-pleaded factual allegations and draws all reasonable inferences in \nPlaintiffs’ favor, but “do[es] not credit legal labels or conclusory statements.” Cheng v. Neumann, 51 \nF.4th 438, 443 (1st Cir. 2022). Dismissal is appropriate if the complaint fails to establish at least one \n“material element necessary to sustain recovery under some actionable legal theory.” Centro Medico del \nTurabo, Inc. v. Feliciano de Melecio, 406 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 2005) (internal citation omitted). \n \n \n \n1 The court has also received and reviewed amici curiae memoranda submitted by GLBTQ Legal Advocates and \nDefenders and the Massachusetts Association of School Superintendents in support of Defendants and the Family \nInstitute of Connecticut in support of Plaintiffs.  \n2 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-30041-MGM   Document 51   Filed 12/14/22   Page 3 of 19\nIII.  FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS2  \n  During the 2020-2021 school year, Plaintiffs’ children B.F. and G.F. were eleven and twelve \nyears old and were students at Baird Middle School in Ludlow, Massachusetts. Early in the school \nyear, school librarian Jordan Funke gave students in B.F.’s sixth grade class an assignment to make \nbiographical videos. Funke invited students to include their gender identity and preferred pronouns \nin their videos. The students also received instruction about language that is inclusive of students \nwith different gender identities. \n  In December 2020, B.F. spoke with a teacher and asked for help talking to Plaintiffs about \nconcerns about depression, low self-esteem, poor self-image, and possible same-sex attraction. The \nteacher spoke with Silvestri, B.F.’s mother, and shared B.F.’s concerns with her. Shortly after that \nconversation, Silvestri sent an email to B.F.’s other teachers, Stacy Monette, Todd Gazda, and \nseveral members of the Ludlow School Committee. In her email, she stated that Plaintiffs were \naware of the teacher’s concerns about B.F.’s mental health, they would be getting B.F. professional \nhelp, and requested that no one receiving the email “have any private conversations with B.[F.] in \nregards to this matter.” (Dkt. No. 22, Am. Compl. ¶ 70.)  \n  On February 28, 2021, B.F. sent an email to Gazda, Marie-Claire Foley, and several teachers. \nIn that email, B.F. identified as genderqueer and announced a new preferred name, one typically \nused by members of the opposite sex, and a list of preferred pronouns. Foley met with B.F. and, \nafter their meeting, sent an email stating that B.F. was “still in the process of telling” Plaintiffs about \nB.F.’s gender identity and instructed school staff that they should not use B.F.’s new preferred name \nand pronouns when communicating with B.F.’s parents. Foley’s position was consistent with a \n \n2 Plaintiffs’ Amended Complaint included a section entitled “Factual Allegations” that contained a mix of “non-\nconclusory, non-speculative factual allegations” together with conclusory statements about the legal significance of \nvarious factual allegations. Cheng, 51 F.4th at 443. The court summarizes the factual allegations, which the court must \ncredit at this stage, but omits the legal conclusions promoted by Plaintiffs. Id.    \n3 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-30041-MGM   Document 51   Filed 12/14/22   Page 4 of 19\npolicy sanctioned by the School Committee, pursuant to which school personnel would only share \ninformation about a student’s expressed gender identity with the student’s parents if the student \nconsented to such communication. After Foley sent her email, teachers at Baird Middle School \nbegan using B.F.’s new preferred name and pronouns. \n  In early March, the same teacher who had spoken with Silvestri in December informed \nPlaintiffs about B.F.’s email, despite the policy and B.F.’s request that Plaintiffs not be told. On \nMarch 8, 2021, Foley sent another email to school staff in which she reiterated that B.F. had \nexpressly requested that Plaintiffs not be told about B.F.’s new first name. Several days later, Foley \ngave B.F. permission to use boys’ bathrooms, girls’ bathrooms, or gender-neutral bathrooms. \nAround this same time, G.F. also began using a different preferred name and school staff did not \ninform Plaintiffs.  \n  On March 18, 2021, Monette met with Plaintiffs. During their meeting, Plaintiffs asserted \nthat Defendants had disregarded their parental rights by not complying with Silvestri’s December \n2020 request that staff not engage with B.F. regarding mental health issues and by failing to notify \nthem about their children’s use of alternate names and pronouns. Plaintiffs also conveyed to \nMonette their belief that school staff were acting improperly by affirming B.F.’s and G.F.’s self-\nasserted gender identities. Monette refused to discuss the issues raised by Plaintiffs and ended the \nmeeting abruptly.  \n  Plaintiffs met with Gazda on March 21, 2021. During that meeting, they expressed concerns \nabout negative consequences their children might experience as a result of being able to use names \nand pronouns associated with the opposite sex. They objected to the way school staff had \ndisregarded their instructions and supported the children’s use of different names and pronouns at \nschool. Plaintiffs also told Gazda that they believed school staff violated their rights with respect to \ntheir children’s student records by concealing information about their children from them. \n4 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-30041-MGM   Document 51   Filed 12/14/22   Page 5 of 19\n  In response, Gazda told Plaintiffs that school staff acted appropriately and consistently with \npolicies approved by the School Committee when they began using the children’s new names and \npronouns without consulting with or notifying Plaintiffs. Gazda also asserted that school staff had \nnot violated the Massachusetts regulation protecting parents’ “rights of confidentiality, inspection, \namendment, and destruction of student records” for students under the age of fourteen and not yet \nin ninth grade. 603 C.M.R. § 23.01. Gazda took the same positions when he met with Plaintiffs again \non March 26, 2021.   \n  Foley met with B.F. weekly throughout the spring of 2021. They discussed B.F.’s gender \nidentity and mental health issues. During their conversations, Foley consistently affirmed B.F.’s \ngender identity. On some occasions, Foley expressed concern about whether Plaintiffs were \nproviding appropriate care for B.F. and whether B.F. had sufficient support to stay safe. She asked \nwhether B.F. was as comfortable discussing issues with the counselor chosen by Plaintiffs as with \nher and encouraged B.F. to speak with another counselor to increase sources of support. Foley did \nnot communicate with Plaintiffs about B.F.’s gender identity or any other issues they discussed. B.F. \nalso talked about gender identity with Funke. Funke was affiliated with an organization that shares \nresources related to gender and gender identity and Funke encouraged B.F. to visit the \norganization’s website.  \n  Later in the spring, Gazda publicly defended the Ludlow Public Schools policy. During \nSchool Committee meetings on May 25, 2021 and June 8, 2021, Gazda expressed support for the \npolicy that instructed school staff to respect students’ expressed gender identities and follow a \nstudent’s preferences about whether to share information about the student’s gender identity with \nthe student’s parents. He described the types of “parental rights” concerns raised by Plaintiffs as \nthinly-veiled intolerance and asserted that for some students who are transgender or gender \nnonconforming, school is the only safe place to express who they are. \n5 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-30041-MGM   Document 51   Filed 12/14/22   Page 6 of 19\nIV.  STATE LAWS, REGULATIONS, AND GUIDANCE REGARDING GENDER IDENTITY \n  States enjoy a general power to regulate the schools they support. Parker v. Hurley, 514 F.3d \n87, 102 (1st Cir. 2008). This includes the power to prescribe a curriculum designed to promote \ntolerance and provide a safe learning environment for all students. Id. While parents do not have to \nsend their children to public school, those who make that choice “do not have a constitutional right \nto direct how a public school teaches their child.” Id. (internal quotation marks omitted) (emphasis in \noriginal). \n  The Commonwealth of Massachusetts recognizes gender identity as a personal characteristic \ndeserving of protection from discrimination. Since July 1, 2012, Massachusetts law has provided that \n“[n]o person shall be excluded from or discriminated against . . . in obtaining the advantages, \nprivileges and courses of study of [a] public school on account of . . . gender identity.” Mass. Gen. \nLaws ch. 76, § 5. As defined under Massachusetts law, “gender identity” means “a person’s gender-\nrelated identity, appearance or behavior, whether or not that gender-related identity, appearance or \nbehavior is different from that traditionally associated with the person’s physiology or assigned sex \nat birth.” Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 4, § 7. \n  A person’s “gender-related identity may be shown by providing . . . any . . . evidence that the \ngender-related identity is sincerely held as part of a person’s core identity; provided, however, that \ngender-related identity shall not be asserted for any improper purpose.” Id.; see also 603 C.M.R. \n§ 26.01.  Neither the statute defining gender identity, nor the statute prohibiting schools from \ndiscriminating based on gender identity, limit the age at which a person can assert a gender identity \nthat “is different from that traditionally associated with the person’s physiology or assigned sex at \nbirth.” Id. Similarly, a separate provision of Massachusetts law related to minors and gender identity \ndoes not distinguish between children of different ages and, instead, provides a blanket prohibition \nagainst health care providers engaging in any practice, with any patient under the age of eighteen, \n6 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-30041-MGM   Document 51   Filed 12/14/22   Page 7 of 19\n“that attempts or purports to impose change of an individual’s . . . gender identity.” Gen. Laws \nch. 112, § 275.  \n  The regulations implementing the anti-discrimination statute applicable to schools state that \n“[a]ll public school systems shall, through their curricula, encourage respect for the human and civil \nrights of all individuals regardless of . . . gender identity.” 603 C.M.R. § 26.05. School committees are \nalso required to “establish policies and procedures . . . that insure that all obstacles to equal access to \nschool programs for all students regardless of . . . gender identity, are removed.” 603 C.M.R. \n§ 26.07(1). Although these laws and regulations were adopted before there was universal support for \nthe values they protect, none were written to provide exceptions to permit parents to override a \nschool’s decision to support students who identify as transgender or gender nonconforming.  \n  Additional, non-binding guidance for schools has been provided by the Massachusetts \nDepartment of Elementary and Secondary Education (DESE). The DESE Guidance provides that \n“[t]he responsibility for determining a student’s gender identity rests with the student, or in the case \nof young students not yet able to advocate for themselves, with the parent.” DESE, GUIDANCE FOR \nMASSACHUSETTS PUBLIC SCHOOLS CREATING A SAFE AND SUPPORTIVE SCHOOL ENVIRONMENT \n(hereafter “DESE Guidance”), https://www.doe.mass.edu/sfs/lgbtq/genderidentity.html#5. \nSchools are advised that “[t]here is no threshold medical or mental health diagnosis or treatment \nrequirement that any student must meet in order to have his or her gender identity recognized and \nrespected by a school.” Id. The DESE Guidance also encourages schools to “engage the student, \nand in the case of a younger student, the parent, with respect to name and pronoun use.” Id. Other \nthan describing younger students as unable to advocate for themselves, the DESE Guidance does \nnot advise schools to treat students of certain ages or grades differently from older students. \n  The DESE Guidance advises that not all transgender and gender nonconforming students \nare open about their gender identities with their families for reasons that can include safety concerns \n7 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-30041-MGM   Document 51   Filed 12/14/22   Page 8 of 19\nand lack of acceptance. Id. When students self-identify to a school as transgender or gender \nnonconforming, the DESE Guidance advises that “[s]chool personnel should speak with the student \nfirst before discussing a student’s gender nonconformity or transgender status with the student’s \nparent or guardian” and “discuss with the student how the school should refer to the student, e.g., \nappropriate pronoun use, in written communication to the student’s parent or guardian.” Id. The \nprovisions of the DESE Guidance related to communications with a student’s family do not \ndistinguish between older and younger students.  \n \nV.  DISCUSSION \n   Plaintiffs have alleged Defendants’ conduct violated three different fundamental parental \nrights protected under the substantive due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment: (1) the \nright to direct the education and upbringing of their children (Count I), (2) the right to make medical \nand mental health decisions for their children (Count II), and (3) the right to family integrity (Count \nIII). Defendants have moved for dismissal, pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), of all three of \nPlaintiffs’ claims, as to all Defendants. They assert that even when the court credits the well-pleaded \nfactual allegations, Plaintiffs’ Amended Complaint fails to identify a substantive due process claim \ncognizable under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. Defendants also argue that any claims asserted against the \nindividual defendants should be dismissed pursuant to the doctrine of qualified immunity. \nThe court begins its analysis by assuming the truth of Plaintiffs’ factual allegations and \nidentifying any statements in the complaint that merely offer legal conclusions couched as fact, since \nsuch conclusory statements are not entitled to the presumption of truth. See Ocasio-Hernández v. \nFortuño-Burset, 640 F.3d 1, 12 (1st Cir. 2011). Many factual allegations set forth in Plaintiffs’ \nAmended Complaint are followed by statements that draw a conclusion about the nature or \nsignificance of the alleged fact. For example, the Amended Complaint contains factual allegations \n8 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-30041-MGM   Document 51   Filed 12/14/22   Page 9 of 19\nabout Defendants’ responses to B.F.’s and G.F.’s requests to use their preferred names and \npronouns followed by brief descriptors identifying the actions as “social transitioning,” “mental \nhealth treatment” and, in one instance, as “psychosocial treatment.” (See e.g. Dkt. No. 22, Am. \nCompl. ¶¶ 42, 43, 45, 46, 56, 74, 78, 84.) At the hearing on Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss, \nPlaintiffs were equivocal as to whether Defendants’ actions constituted actual mental health \ntreatment or if either of their children had an actual existing mental health condition related to \ngender identity. While Plaintiffs maintained that Defendants were providing mental health treatment \nwhen they “permit[ted] [B.F. and G.F.] to be identified as either nonbinary or the opposite sex of \nwhat their bodies are,” the Amended Complaint alleges insufficient facts for the court to conclude \nthat the conduct at issue constituted mental health treatment. (Dkt. No. 48, Tr. Oct. 17, 2022 Hr’g, \n14.) Although “social transitioning,” “mental health treatment,” and “psychosocial treatment” all \nappear to be terms of art, Plaintiffs have not provided the context necessary for the court to infer \nthe alleged conduct had clinical significance, as the Amended Complaint describes the terms in a \nconclusory manner and contains no allegations that either minor had a diagnosed mental health \ncondition related to gender identity. \n“Being transgender is . . .  not a psychiatric condition, and implies no impairment in \njudgment, stability, reliability, or general social or vocational capabilities.” Grimm v. Gloucester Cnty. \nSch. Bd., 972 F.3d 586, 594 (4th Cir. 2020), as amended (Aug. 28, 2020) (internal quotation marks \nomitted). Gender dysphoria is a recognized mental health disorder, but Plaintiffs have not alleged \neither child has been diagnosed with gender dysphoria, or even that Defendants erroneously \nbelieved the children suffered from gender dysphoria. Id. at 594-95. Plaintiffs have not alleged \nDefendants’ actions were undertaken as part of a treatment plan for gender dysphoria or explained \nhow referring to a person by their preferred name and pronouns, which requires no special training \nor skill, has clinical significance when there is no treatment plan or diagnosis in place. Similarly, there \n9 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-30041-MGM   Document 51   Filed 12/14/22   Page 10 of 19\nare no non-conclusory allegations that social transitioning was actually occurring or includes \nsupportive actions taken by third parties, as opposed to actions a person takes to understand or align \ntheir external gender presentation with their gender identity. Addressing a person using their \npreferred name and pronouns simply accords the person the basic level of respect expected in a civil \nsociety generally, and, more specifically, in Massachusetts public schools where discrimination on \nthe basis of gender identity is not permitted. See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 76, § 5. This is true regardless \nof an individual’s age, provided the individual does not have a fraudulent purpose for using a new \npreferred name or pronouns. Id. \nIn the absence of supporting factual allegations, such as a relevant medically-recognized \ndiagnosis and treatment plan, the court disregards Plaintiffs’ conclusory statements describing the \nuse of preferred names and pronouns as mental health treatment. Plaintiffs have failed to adequately \nallege that Defendants provided medical or mental health treatment to B.F. and G.F. simply by \nhonoring their requests to use preferred names and pronouns at school. Accordingly, Plaintiffs have \nnot adequately stated a claim that Defendants usurped their right to make medical and mental health \ntreatment decisions for their children. Count II is, therefore, dismissed.  \nThe court next considers whether the factual allegations are sufficient to state the \nsubstantive due process claims asserted in Counts I and III. The substantive due process guarantees \nof the Fourteenth Amendment protect individuals from arbitrary government actions that interfere \nwith “those fundamental rights . . . which are . . . deeply rooted in this Nation’s history and \ntradition.” Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 U.S. 702, 720-21 (1997) (internal quotation marks omitted). \nThe Due Process Clause protects against egregious abuses by government actors, but does not \n“impos[e] liability whenever someone cloaked with state authority causes harm” or guarantee that \nofficials will use care when acting on behalf of the state. County of Sacramento v. Lewis, 523 U.S. 833, \n848-49 (1998). The vehicle for enforcing the substantive rights guaranteed under the Fourteenth \n10 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-30041-MGM   Document 51   Filed 12/14/22   Page 11 of 19\nAmendment is 42 U.S.C. § 1983, which “affords a private right of action in favor of persons whose \nfederally assured rights are abridged by state actors.” Kando v. Rhode Island State Bd. of Elections, 880 \nF.3d 53, 58 (1st Cir. 2018). \n“To be cognizable, a substantive due process claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 must allege facts \nso extreme and egregious as to shock the contemporary conscience.” Abdisamad v. City of Lewiston, \n960 F.3d 56, 59-60 (1st Cir. 2020) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Martinez v. Cui, 608 \nF.3d 54, 64 (1st Cir. 2010) (“[T]he shocks-the-conscience test . . .  governs all substantive due \nprocess claims based on executive, as opposed to legislative, action.”). “[C]onduct intended to injure \nin some way unjustifiable by any government interest is the sort of official action most likely to rise \nto the conscience-shocking level.” Lewis, 523 U.S. at 849.  \nAt the motion to dismiss phase, substantive due process claims “must be carefully \nscrutinized to determine if the alleged facts support the conclusion that the state has violated an \nindividual’s constitutional rights.” Rivera v. Rhode Island, 402 F.3d 27, 33 (1st Cir. 2005). Courts in the \nFirst Circuit take a “two-tiered approach” to substantive due process claims based on the behavior \nof state actors. Martinez, 608 F.3d at 64. Under this approach, a plaintiff must establish both \nconscience-shocking behavior by the defendant and “that a protected right was offended” by the \ndefendant’s conduct. Id. at 65. Generally, courts first determine whether the alleged conduct was \nsufficiently egregious because it is “[o]nly after ‘show[ing] a constitutionally significant level of \nculpability’ [that] a plaintiff [may] ‘turn to establishing that a protected right was offended.’”3 \nAbdisamad, 960 F.3d at 60 (quoting Martinez, 608 F.3d at 65).    \n \n3 Prior to Abdisamad,  the First Circuit stated that while courts have “typically looked first to whether the acts alleged \nwere conscience-shocking,” the two-tiered process need not be applied rigidly. Harron v. Town of Franklin, 660 F.3d 531, \n536 (1st Cir. 2011). However, as the Supreme Court explained in Lewis, courts do not need to determine whether “to \nrecogniz[e] a substantive due process right to be free of [the alleged] executive action” unless they first determine the \n“necessary condition of egregious behavior” has been satisfied. Lewis, 523 U.S. at 847 n.8. There is no reason to depart \nfrom the typical analytical framework in this case given the relatively vague manner in which Plaintiffs have described \nthe asserted fundamental liberty interests allegedly violated by Defendants and connected those interests to historically-\nestablished fundamental rights and liberties. See Glucksberg, 521 U.S. at 721 (1997); see also Martinez, 608 F.3d at 65 n.9 \n11 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-30041-MGM   Document 51   Filed 12/14/22   Page 12 of 19\n   During the hearing on Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss, the court asked Plaintiffs to identify \nthe specific allegations of conscience-shocking conduct supporting their claims. Plaintiffs argued \ngenerally that Defendants’ adoption and implementation of a policy of withholding information \nabout a student’s gender identity deprived Plaintiffs of their rights to make decisions about the \nupbringing of their children and intentionally undermined the parent/child relationship in a manner \nthat shocks the conscience. The court understands this conduct, as alleged, to be offered in support \nof Plaintiffs’ claims in Counts I and III.  \nThere is no precise definition for conscience-shocking behavior that can be applied \nmechanistically to Plaintiffs’ allegations. See DePoutot v. Raffaelly, 424 F.3d 112, 118 (1st Cir. 2005). \nHowever, a “stunning” level of arbitrariness that goes beyond “[m]ere violations of state law” is \nrequired. Pagán v. Calderón, 448 F.3d 16, 32 (1st Cir. 2006) (internal quotation marks omitted). Bad \nfaith may help tip the scale, but “the contemporary conscience is much more likely” to be shocked \nby conduct that was “intended to injure in some way unjustifiable by any government interest.” \nDePoutot, 424 F.3d at 119 (internal quotation marks omitted). The nature of the right violated and \nthe government’s competing interests, if any, may inform the determination of whether particular \nbehavior shocks the conscience. See Martinez, 608 F.3d at 66. “Indeed, ‘[a] hallmark of successful \nchallenges is an extreme lack of proportionality, as the test is primarily concerned with violations of \npersonal rights so severe[,] so disproportionate to the need presented, and so inspired by malice or \nsadism rather than a merely careless or unwise excess of zeal that it amounted to a brutal and \ninhumane abuse of official power literally shocking to the conscience.’” Harron v. Town of Franklin, \n660 F.3d 531, 536 (1st Cir. 2011) (quoting González-Fuentes v. Molina, 607 F.3d 864, 881 (1st Cir. \n2010)) (alterations in original).  \n \n(describing the two-tiered approach as beginning with the level of culpability, while also observing “some tension \nbetween how Lewis and Glucksberg described the order in which courts should proceed to identify whether a plaintiff has \nidentified a protected right”).    \n12 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-30041-MGM   Document 51   Filed 12/14/22   Page 13 of 19\n   Often, “an exact analysis of circumstances” is needed “before any abuse of power [can be] \ncondemned as conscience shocking.” Lewis, 523 U.S. at 850. Here, the circumstances certainly \ninclude the facts Plaintiffs have alleged about the conduct of various defendants. These include: \ninviting students to provide their preferred pronouns as part of a personal biography project; sharing \ninformation about gender identity with B.F.; failing to respond to Silvestri’s December 2020 email; \nengaging in supportive discussions with B.F. about gender identity; facilitating B.F.’s and G.F.’s use \nof their preferred names and pronouns while at school; deciding not to notify Plaintiffs when B.F. \nand G.F. began using different preferred names and pronouns; and publicly describing the views of \nindividuals, including parents, who oppose Ludlow Public School policies for supporting \ntransgender and gender nonconforming students, as intolerant and hateful. The relevant \ncircumstances also include Massachusetts laws and regulations regarding gender identity, which \nestablish a significant government interest in providing students with a school environment in which \nthey may safely express their gender identities,4 regardless of their ages or the preferences of their \nparents. Plaintiffs have not challenged the constitutionality of these laws. \nPlaintiffs have framed their claims in the context of their rights as parents to make decisions \nfor their children without state interference. Defendants have framed their actions in the context of \nobligations under Massachusetts law to provide a nondiscriminatory environment to all their \nstudents. At the hearing on Defendants’ motion, Plaintiffs acknowledged that Defendants were not \npermitted to discriminate on the basis of gender identity, but asserted that Defendants’ adoption and \nimplementation of a policy of withholding information about their children’s gender identity from \nparents went beyond what the law required and intentionally undermined the parent/child \nrelationship in a manner that shocks the conscience. \n \n4 Provided, of course, that there was no evidence that a student had asserted a particular gender identity for an improper \npurpose. See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 4, § 7. \n13 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-30041-MGM   Document 51   Filed 12/14/22   Page 14 of 19\n  On its face, the Massachusetts non-discrimination statute does not require such a policy and \nit is disconcerting that school administrators or a school committee adopted and implemented a \npolicy requiring school staff to actively hide information from parents about something of \nimportance regarding their child. Indeed, in an earlier case, this court recognized that deception by \nschool officials could shock the conscience where the conduct obscured risks to a person’s bodily \nintegrity and was not justified by any government interest. See Hootstein v. Amherst-Pelham Reg. Sch. \nComm., 361 F. Supp. 3d 94, 112 (D. Mass. 2019). In that case, the plaintiff alleged school officials \nmade deceptive statements about the safety of school drinking water that obscured the risks he \nfaced when he drank water at the school and the deception violated his right to bodily integrity.5 Id. \nHere, the court must consider the specific facts of this case—including the government interest, if \nany, served by Defendants’ conduct—to determine whether Plaintiffs have met their burden of \nidentifying conscience-shocking conduct.  \n  In December 2020, B.F. talked with a teacher about mental health concerns and possible \nsame-sex attraction and expressed relief and gratitude when the teacher offered to talk with Plaintiffs \nabout those concerns. The teacher then contacted B.F.’s mother (Silvestri), who responded by \nsending an email to B.F.’s teachers, Monette, Gazda, and members of the School Committee, in \nwhich she stated that Plaintiffs were getting B.F. professional help and requested that school staff \nnot have any further private conversations with B.F. related to the concerns the teacher and B.F. had \ndiscussed. Two months later, B.F. identified as genderqueer, announced a new preferred name and \nlist of preferred pronouns and, in contrast to December, did not ask for help talking with Plaintiffs. \nInstead, B.F. asked school staff to wait to use the new name and pronouns with Plaintiffs until after \nB.F. told Plaintiffs about them. Despite B.F.’s request and the alleged policy, the same teacher who \n \n5 The plaintiff in Hootstein was a grandparent proceeding pro se and only his own bodily integrity claim survived the \nmotion to dismiss because, as a pro se litigant, he could not bring claims on behalf of others. \n14 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-30041-MGM   Document 51   Filed 12/14/22   Page 15 of 19\ntalked with Silvestri in December 2020 informed Silvestri about Plaintiff’s gender identity. This \ncontact with B.F.’s parents was made in violation of school policy and without administrative \napproval. Upon learning that B.F. was using a new name and pronouns at school, Plaintiffs met with \nMonette. They asserted school staff were acting illegally by allowing their children to use preferred \nnames and pronouns without parental permission. Following that meeting, Defendants deferred to \nthe preferences of B.F. and G.F. and did not share any information about their gender identities \nwith Plaintiffs.  \n  Massachusetts has identified a strong government interest in providing all students, \nregardless of age, with a school environment safe from discrimination based on gender identity. \nUnder Massachusetts law, a person may establish their gender identity with “any . . . evidence that \nthe gender-related identity is sincerely held as part of [the] person’s core identity,” except that \n“gender-related identity shall not be asserted for any improper purpose.” Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 4, § 7; \nsee also 603 C.M.R. § 26.01. There is no statutory limitation on the age at which an individual may \nassert a gender identity “different from that traditionally associated with the person’s physiology or \nassigned sex at birth,” and no exception that would allow a parent’s beliefs to supersede a minor’s \nsincerely held beliefs. Id.; see also Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 112, § 275 (barring gender conversion therapy \nfor all minors).  \nThough non-binding, the DESE Guidance related to gender identity also provides relevant \ncontext for Defendants’ actions. The DESE Guidance emphasizes the importance of creating a safe \nand supportive environment for students and encourages schools to work with students to develop \nplans for use of preferred names and pronouns. “[I]n the case of a younger student,” DESE advises \nschools to create a plan with input from parents, but DESE has not defined younger students, other \nthan by describing them as “not yet able to advocate for themselves.” DESE Guidance, \nhttps://www.doe.mass. edu/sfs/lgbtq/genderidentity.html#5. The DESE Guidance also \n15 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-30041-MGM   Document 51   Filed 12/14/22   Page 16 of 19\nencourages schools to consult with students who assert a different gender identity at school before \ndisclosing information about a student’s gender identity to the student’s family. \nPlaintiffs assert the Ludlow Public Schools adopted and implemented a policy that went \nbeyond the DESE Guidance and rigidly prohibited any communication with parents about a \nstudent’s gender identity unless the student consented and this policy shocked the conscience, at \nleast when applied to students in middle school. The court agrees that the policy, as described by \nPlaintiffs, was based on a flawed interpretation of the DESE Guidance and ignored the plain \nlanguage advising that parents be informed after the student is advised that such communication will \noccur. See id. (“School personnel should speak with the student first before discussing a student’s \ngender nonconformity or transgender status with the student’s parent or guardian.”). Students and \nparents would almost certainly be better served by a more thoughtful policy that facilitated a \nsupportive and safe disclosure by the student, with support and education available for students and \nparents, as needed and when accepted. Such a policy should also consider the many complicated and \nemotional issues and scenarios that may arise when this type of information is shared. Beliefs, \nunderstanding, and opinions surrounding this subject may evolve in a positive way with the benefit \nof information and honest dialogue. But, currently, the topic may also evoke negative or harmful \nreactions, which also must be considered. This is especially true when, as in this case, the students \nare old enough to independently assert their transgender or gender nonconforming identity, but still \nmany years away from adulthood. Unlike the alleged Ludlow Public Schools policy, a policy that \nfacilitates communication between students and parents would be consistent with the DESE \nGuidance and its recommendation to avoid surprising students when informing parents about the \nmatter. \nHowever, even if Defendants’ policy was imperfect and contrary to the non-binding DESE \nGuidance, the alleged policy was consistent with Massachusetts law and the goal of providing \n16 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-30041-MGM   Document 51   Filed 12/14/22   Page 17 of 19\ntransgender and gender nonconforming students with a safe school environment. This case involves \na difficult and developing issue; schools, and society as a whole, are currently grappling with this \nissue, especially as it relates to children and parents. See Martinez, 608 F.3d at 66 (“[W]hether \nbehavior is conscience-shocking may be informed . . . by the nature of the right violated.”). While \nthe court is apprehensive about the alleged policy and actions of the Ludlow Public Schools with \nregard to parental notification, it cannot conclude the decision to withhold information about B.F. \nand G.F. from Plaintiffs was “so extreme, egregious, or outrageously offensive as to shock the \ncontemporary conscience,” given the difficulties this issue presents and the competing interests \ninvolved. DePoutot, 424 F.3d at 119. As conscience-shocking conduct is a necessary element for a \nsubstantive due process claim, the court ends its analysis here, without assessing whether Plaintiffs \nhave adequately identified their protected rights and established they were offended under these \nfacts. See Abdisamad, 960 F.3d at 60.   \nFinally, having determined that Plaintiffs’ Amended Complaint should be dismissed on \nsubstantive grounds, it is not necessary for the court to address Defendants’ arguments regarding \nqualified immunity. However, the court briefly notes that had Plaintiffs’ Amended Complaint \nsurvived the substantive analysis, qualified immunity would warrant dismissal of the claims asserted \nagainst all individual defendants. See id. (“Individual government officials may be sued ‘for federal \nconstitutional or statutory violations under § 1983,’ though ‘they are generally shielded from civil \ndamages liability under the principle of qualified immunity.’”). Qualified immunity shields individual \ngovernment actors from liability unless the plaintiff can demonstrate both that the “the defendant \nviolated the plaintiff’s constitutional rights” and that “the right at issue was ‘clearly established’ at \nthe time of the alleged violation.” Est. of Rahim by Rahim v. Doe, 51 F.4th 402, 410 (1st Cir. 2022). \nTo satisfy the “clearly established” prong, a “plaintiff must ‘identify either controlling \nauthority or a consensus of persuasive authority sufficient to put [a state actor] on notice that his \n17 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-30041-MGM   Document 51   Filed 12/14/22   Page 18 of 19\nconduct fell short of the constitutional norm.’” Id. (quoting Conlogue v. Hamilton, 906 F.3d 150, 155 \n(1st Cir. 2018)). While “there need not be a case directly on point,” a plaintiff must be able to \nidentify “precedents existing at the time of the incident [that] establish[ed] the applicable legal rule \nwith sufficient clarity and specificity” that the defendant was on notice that their conduct would \nviolate the rule. McKenney v. Mangino, 873 F.3d 75, 82-83 (1st Cir. 2017) (internal quotation marks \nomitted). Here, Plaintiffs would have to identify authority addressing sufficiently similar facts \noccurring where similar state laws applied. That authority would either need to be binding in \nMassachusetts or demonstrate a consensus among persuasive authorities such that the individual \ndefendants should have known their actions violated Plaintiffs’ parental rights protected by \nsubstantive due process. \nHaving reviewed all the cases cited by Plaintiffs, the court finds they do not meet this \nburden. First, the court observes that legal protections for gender identity are a recent development \nand a broad awareness of issues surrounding the topic of gender identity is still growing. Second, as \ndiscussed above, Defendants did not provide mental healthcare to Plaintiffs’ children when \nsupporting their use of preferred names and pronouns. Finally, consistent with principles established \nin Meyer v. Nebraska, 262 U.S. 390 (1923) and Pierce v. Society of Sisters, 268 U.S. 510 (1925), Plaintiffs’ \nright to direct the upbringing of their children allows them to “choose between public and private \nschools,” but does not give them a right “to interfere with the general power of the state to regulate \neducation.” Parker, 514 F.3d at 102. Here, the individual defendants’ respective decisions not to \nshare information with Plaintiffs about their children’s gender identities complied with a Ludlow \nPublic Schools policy which, though not required by, was consistent with Massachusetts laws that \nhave not been challenged by Plaintiffs.  \n \n \n18 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-30041-MGM   Document 51   Filed 12/14/22   Page 19 of 19\nVI.  CONCLUSION \n  For the reasons discussed above, Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss (Dkt. No. 25) is \nALLOWED. Plaintiffs’ Amended Complaint (Dkt. No. 22) is dismissed and this case may now be \nclosed. \n  It is so Ordered.   \n \n               /s/ Mark G. Mastroianni                _                                  \n              MARK G.

R. App. P. 29(a)(2) because we share sovereign and compelling \ninterests in making schools safe for all students.  Defendants-Appellees Ludlow \nSchool Committee and various school officials (together, “Ludlow”), like other \nschool authorities around the country, are charged with one of the most important \nfunctions of government: nurturing successive generations of children into capable \ncitizens of a diverse and unified nation.  In recognition of the paramount \nimportance of this responsibility, courts (including this Court) have long afforded \nState and local governments significant discretion to shape school policies to best \nserve this goal, so long as they act within the constraints of federal law, including \nthe Constitution and antidiscrimination law. \nThe Amici States respectfully submit this brief to underscore the breadth of \nthis discretion invested in local schools, the problems posed by Plaintiffs’ proposed \njudicial intervention in school policymaking, and the reasons why policies like \nLudlow’s serve important governmental purposes.  Ludlow has exercised its \ndiscretion to balance parents’ involvement in their child’s education with the \nrecognition that not all students are open about their gender identity at home.  \n1 \n\nCase: 23-1069     Document: 00118024852     Page: 12      Date Filed: 06/27/2023      Entry ID: 6576452\n \nWhere a student does not want the school to disclose their status to others, \nincluding parents, information on the student’s gender identity is not shared.1  This \npolicy endeavors to keep transgender students supported and safe at school, while \nproviding students space and support to initiate these conversations about their \nidentities within their own families.  Conversely, the rule urged by Plaintiffs—one \nin which the school is constitutionally bound to share information about students’ \ngender identity with parents against students’ wishes—undermines trust between \nstudents and teachers, creates significant administrative burdens, and improperly \ninserts school officials into private conversations that should happen between \nchildren and their parents at the time and in the manner chosen by the family.  \nPolicies like Ludlow’s are supported by social science research indicating that safe \nand supportive school environments are critically important for all students—and \nfor transgender and gender-nonconforming students in particular.  Schools and \neducators that build trust and support students’ identities set these students up for \nhigher academic achievement, improved mental health outcomes, and bigger and \nbetter plans for the future. \n \n1   Unlike other schools that have seen similar policies challenged, see, e.g., \nJohn and Jane Parents 1 v. Montgomery Cnty. Bd. of Ed., No. 8:20-cv-3552-PWG, \n2022 WL 3544256, at *2 (D. Md. Aug. 18, 2022), Ludlow has not adopted a \nformal written policy, see JA19.  This brief thus bases its characterization of \nLudlow’s policy on Plaintiffs’ allegations in the complaint. \n2 \n\nCase: 23-1069     Document: 00118024852     Page: 13      Date Filed: 06/27/2023      Entry ID: 6576452\n \nWe therefore urge this Court to affirm the decision below dismissing \nPlaintiffs’ complaint. \nARGUMENT \nI.  The States Have Broad Discretion To Shape The School Environment \nTo Ensure Students Succeed. \nA.  States use the public school system to educate the next generation \nof citizens. \nPublic schools play a foundational role in society.  For decades, courts have \nrecognized that these institutions serve as States’ primary tool in raising successive \ngenerations of citizens, providing them with the tools they need to lead fulfilled \nlives and creating the buildings blocks of broader societal cohesion.  In Brown v. \nBoard of Education, for instance, the Supreme Court observed that public schools \nare “a principal instrument in awakening the child to cultural values, in preparing \nhim for later professional training, and in helping him to adjust normally to his \nenvironment,” such that “it is doubtful that any child may reasonably be expected \nto succeed in life if he is denied the opportunity of an education.”  347 U.S. 483, \n493 (1954).  Indeed, the Brown Court noted, the public school system is “the very \nfoundation of good citizenship” and of key “importance to our democratic \nsociety.”  Id.   \nSince Brown, the Court has repeatedly “express[ed] an abiding respect for \nthe vital role of education in a free society” and recognized “the grave significance \n3 \n\nCase: 23-1069     Document: 00118024852     Page: 14      Date Filed: 06/27/2023      Entry ID: 6576452\n \nof education both to the individual and to our society.”  San Antonio Indep. Sch. \nDist. v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 1, 30 (1973) (collecting cases; cleaned up).  In \nAmbach v. Norwick, the Court upheld a State statute limiting employment as a \nteacher to American citizens because of “[t]he importance of public schools in the \npreparation of individuals for participation as citizens, and in the preservation of \nthe values on which our society rests.”  441 U.S. 68, 76 (1979).  In doing so, the \nCourt explained how a robust public school system also benefits the States and \nsociety as a whole:  Common education serves as an “‘assimilative force’ by which \ndiverse and conflicting elements in our society are brought together on a broad but \ncommon ground” and “inculcat[es] fundamental values necessary to the \nmaintenance of a democratic political system.”  Id. at 77; see also id. at 79 (“[A] \nteacher has an opportunity to influence the attitudes of students toward \ngovernment, the political process, and a citizen’s social responsibilities.  This \ninfluence is crucial to the continued good health of a democracy.”). \nSimilarly, in Bethel School District No. 403 v. Fraser, the Court observed \nthat public schools “prepare pupils for citizenship in the Republic” by \n“inculcat[ing] the habits and manners of civility as values in themselves conducive \nto happiness” and also recognized that such values are “indispensable to the \npractice of self-government in the community and the nation.”  478 U.S. 675, 681 \n(1986).  This principle has also been emphasized in oft-cited concurrences.  See, \n4 \n\nCase: 23-1069     Document: 00118024852     Page: 15      Date Filed: 06/27/2023      Entry ID: 6576452\n \ne.g., McCollum v. Bd. of Educ. of Sch. Dist. No. 71, 333 U.S. 203, 216, 231 (1948) \n(Frankfurter, J., concurring) (public schools are “perhaps the most powerful agency \nfor promoting cohesion among a heterogenous democratic people” and are “at once \nthe symbol of our democracy and the most pervasive means for promoting our \ncommon destiny”); School Dist. of Abington Township v. Schempp, 374 U.S. 203, \n241-42 (1963) (Brennan, J., concurring) (stating that “public schools serve a \nuniquely public function: the training of American citizens” and observing that a \n“public secular education” serves “uniquely democratic values”).  So too has this \nCourt repeatedly recognized the key role schools play in shaping the character of \nfuture citizens.  See, e.g., Quintero de Quintero v. Aponte-Roque, 974 F.2d 226, \n229 (1st Cir. 1992); Parker v. Hurley, 514 F.3d 87, 95 (1st Cir. 2008); Griswold v. \nDriscoll, 616 F.3d 53, 58 (1st Cir. 2010). \nIn light of the indispensable benefits public schools provide, the Brown \nCourt observed that “education is perhaps the most important function of state and \nlocal governments.”  347 U.S. at 493.  The Court has echoed this observation in \nensuing decades.  See, e.g., Ambach, 441 U.S. at 75-76 (the provision of education \n“goes to the heart of representative government” and “fulfills a most fundamental \nobligation of government to its constituency” (cleaned up)); Wisconsin v. Yoder, \n406 U.S. 205, 213 (1972) (“Providing public schools ranks at the very apex of the \nfunction of a State.”).   \n5 \n\nCase: 23-1069     Document: 00118024852     Page: 16      Date Filed: 06/27/2023      Entry ID: 6576452\n \nPublic schools thus lie at the heart of both an obligation and an opportunity \nfor States—an obligation to provide people with the skills they need as citizens, \nand an opportunity to forge a unified society that will stand the test of time. \nB.  States are vested with meaningful discretion to shape school \npolicies.   \nIn order to fulfill our critical educational mission, States have latitude to \nshape the school environment.  The Supreme Court has repeatedly underscored \nthat “States and local school boards are generally afforded considerable discretion \nin operating public schools.”  Edwards v. Aguillard, 482 U.S. 578, 583 (1987); see \nalso, e.g., Tinker v. Des Moines Indep. Cmty. Sch. Dist., 393 U.S. 503, 507 (1969) \n(“[T]he Court has repeatedly emphasized the need for affirming the comprehensive \nauthority of the States and of school officials … to prescribe and control conduct in \nthe schools.”); Epperson v. Arkansas, 393 U.S. 97, 104 (1968) (“By and large, \npublic education in our Nation is committed to the control of state and local \nauthorities.”).  And this discretion stems from the States’ paramount interest in \neducating our citizenry.  See, e.g., Yoder, 406 U.S. at 213 (“There is no doubt as to \nthe power of a State, having a high responsibility for education of its citizens, to \nimpose reasonable regulations for the control and duration of basic education.”); \nAmbach, 441 U.S. at 78 (“In shaping the students’ experience to achieve \neducational goals, teachers by necessity have wide discretion over the way course \n6 \n\nCase: 23-1069     Document: 00118024852     Page: 17      Date Filed: 06/27/2023      Entry ID: 6576452\n \nmaterial is communicated to students.”); Bd. of Educ., Island Trees Union Free \nSch. Dist. No. 26 v. Pico, 457 U.S. 853, 863-64 (1982) (noting that “local school \nboards have broad discretion in the management of school affairs” and “must be \npermitted to establish and apply their curriculum … to transmit community values” \n(cleaned up)). \nOf course, States’ latitude to control the school environment is subject to \nrestraints imposed by federal law, including prohibitions against discrimination \ncontained in the Equal Protection Clause and Title IX of the Education \nAmendments of 1972.  See, e.g., Asociacion de Educacion Privada de Puerto Rico, \nInc. v. Garcia-Padilla, 490 F.3d 1, 11 (1st Cir. 2007); Grimm v. Gloucester Cnty. \nSch. Bd., 972 F.3d 586, 606-19 (4th Cir. 2020).  States’ discretion is also subject to \nconstitutional constraints.  See, e.g., Tinker, 393 U.S. at 507; see also Parker, 514 \nF.3d at 107 (recognizing “the many competing constitutional demands made by \nparents, students, teachers, and the schools’ other constituents”). \nAgainst this backdrop, this Court has echoed the “well-recognized” \nproposition that “while parents can choose between public and private schools, \nthey do not have a constitutional right to ‘direct how a public school teaches their \nchild.’”  Parker, 514 F.3d at 102 (quoting Blau v. Fort Thomas Pub. Sch. Dist., \n401 F.3d 381, 395 (6th Cir. 2005)); see also Brown v. Hot, Sexy and Safer Prods., \nInc., 68 F.3d 525, 533-34 (1st Cir. 1995); Griswold, 616 F.3d at 58.  Consequently, \n7 \n\nCase: 23-1069     Document: 00118024852     Page: 18      Date Filed: 06/27/2023      Entry ID: 6576452\n \nStates retain a “general power … to regulate education,” Parker, 514 F.3d at 102, \nand parents’ rights are viewed as “not absolute in the public school context and can \nbe subject to reasonable regulation,” id. (quoting Littlefield v. Forney Indep. Sch. \nDist., 268 F.3d 275, 291 (5th Cir. 2001)).  Thus, as this Court has made clear, local \nofficials have meaningful discretion to determine how to operate schools to best \nserve their students. \nMoreover, contrary to Plaintiffs’ suggestion, Br. 23-26, States’ authority \nwithin schoolhouse walls is not limited strictly to issues of curriculum.  The \nSupreme Court has recognized the States’ discretion vis-à-vis schools’ broader \neducational operations, including teachers’ “direct, day-to-day contact with \nstudents both in the classrooms and in the other varied activities of a modern \nschool.”  Ambach, 441 U.S. at 78.  As the Court has noted, “a teacher’s function as \nan example for students … exists independently of particular classroom subjects.”  \nId. at 80; cf., e.g., McCollum, 333 U.S. at 224 (Frankfurter, J., concurring) (noting \nin a discussion of “released time” for religious instruction that “education was \nmore than instruction in a classroom”). \nIn keeping with this guidance, courts in this State and around the country \nhave routinely rejected parental liberty claims touching on a wide array of non-\ncurricular issues.  See, e.g., Curtis v. Sch. Comm. of Falmouth, 652 N.E.2d 580, \n584-87 (Mass. 1995) (voluntary condom distribution program); Immediato v. Rye \n8 \n\nCase: 23-1069     Document: 00118024852     Page: 19      Date Filed: 06/27/2023      Entry ID: 6576452\n \nNeck Sch. Dist., 73 F.3d 454, 462 (2d Cir. 1996) (community service requirement); \nHerndon v. Chapel Hill-Carrboro City Board of Education, 89 F.3d 174, 176 (4th \nCir. 1996) (community service requirement); Bailey v. Va. High Sch. League, Inc., \n488 F. App’x 714, 716 (4th Cir. 2012) (eligibility for interscholastic athletics); Kite \nv. Marshall, 661 F.2d 1027, 1029-30 (5th Cir. 1981) (attendance at summer \nathletic training camps); Littlefield, 268 F.3d at 291 (dress code); Blau, 401 F.3d at \n395-96 (dress code); Howe v. Aytes, No. 2:14-cv-00077, 2016 WL 3262600, at *1-\n4 (M.D. Tenn. June 10, 2016) (student pickup procedures requiring parents to wait \ninside vehicles).  The breadth and variety of these holdings underscore the \nimportance of schools’ leeway to guide students in the manner the schools \nthemselves deem best suited to achieve their critical educational goals.2 \nC.  Plaintiffs’ proposed framework creates significant burdens on \nState and local governments’ ability to fulfill their schools’ \nmissions.   \nThe rule suggested by Plaintiffs here—that the Constitution rigidly and \nmechanistically requires schools to inform parents of conversations with students \n \n2   While Plaintiffs suggest the lower court erred by “promoting Defendants’ \nassertion they have a duty to ‘protect’ gender discordant children from their \nparents,” Br. 27, the existence vel non of such a legal “duty” is irrelevant here.  \nEven absent a legally cognizable tort-based or statutory duty to prevent harm to \nstudents, Ludlow is not (as Plaintiffs would have it) forbidden from exercising its \ndiscretion to act in what it deems students’ best interests. \n9 \n\nCase: 23-1069     Document: 00118024852     Page: 20      Date Filed: 06/27/2023      Entry ID: 6576452\n \nabout gender identity regardless of circumstances against those students’ wills—\nwould interfere with critical functions of public education. \nPerhaps most important, this rule would chill open communication and \ndamage the trust between students and their teachers, coaches, and guidance \ncounselors.  Trusting relationships with school staff aid students in manifold ways:  \nStudents who trust their teachers are more engaged in learning, have improved \nacademic achievement, are less likely to avoid school, are more self-directed, and \nhave greater confidence in their own ability to process information even after \nleaving school.3  These kinds of benefits lie at the very heart of the civic purpose \nof public education. \nThese benefits would be undermined by a rule requiring school officials to \nprovide parents with information about a student’s gender identity against the \nstudent’s will—particularly where the student’s request is based on fears of \nnegative reactions, or even for their own safety.  A student not wanting information \nabout their gender identity shared with their family would not share that \ninformation with their teachers either, creating distance that otherwise might not \n \n3   See Monika Platz, Trust Between Teacher and Student in Academic \nEducation at School, 55 J. Phil. Ed. 688-697 (2021), https://doi.org/10.1111/1467-\n9752.12560; Sara Rimm-Kaufman & Lia Sandilos, Improving Students’ \nRelationships with Teachers to Provide Essential Supports for Learning, Am. \nPsychological Ass’n (2015), https://www.apa.org/education-career/k12/\nrelationships.   \n10 \n\nCase: 23-1069     Document: 00118024852     Page: 21      Date Filed: 06/27/2023      Entry ID: 6576452\n \nexist and preventing the student from reaping the benefits that can result from close \nrelationships with school staff.  Indeed, in other contexts, courts and others have \ndecried legal rules that destroy trust between students and their teachers and \ncoaches.  See, e.g., Vernonia Sch. Dist. 47J v. Acton, 515 U.S. 646, 664 (1995); \nEarls ex rel. Earls v. Bd. of Ed. of Tecumseh Pub. Sch. Dist., 242 F.3d 1264, 1280 \n(10th Cir. 2001) (Ebel, J., dissenting) (noting that Vernonia stated that “any \nsuspicion-based [drug] testing changes the relationship between students and \nteachers from one of trust and cooperation to one of distrust and adversarial \ninteractions”); see also Kahn v. East Side Union High Sch. Dist., 75 P.3d 30, 52 \n(Cal. 2003) (Kennard, J., concurring in part) (failure to assign coaches a duty to \nensure school sports are conducted safely “puts an end to [students’] trust” in \ncoaches “not to carelessly and needlessly expose them to injury” that arises from \ncoaches’ roles as “a mentor or role model”). \nPlaintiffs’ proposed constitutional rule would also impose significant \nadministrative burdens on schools.  Plaintiffs broadly frame their argument around \nthe notion that they—and not schools—bear sole responsibility for making \n“decisions regarding a child’s well-being,” Br. 25, but this notion is \nunaccompanied by any coherent limiting principle.  These particular Plaintiffs \nobject to a policy regarding students’ gender identity, but other parents may have \nwholly different objections to a school’s operations and their bearing on a student’s \n11 \n\nCase: 23-1069     Document: 00118024852     Page: 22      Date Filed: 06/27/2023      Entry ID: 6576452\n \namorphously defined well-being.  If school officials were constitutionally required \nto share any such school-related information with parents, schools could be \nrequired to make time-consuming and burdensome case-by-case determinations of \nwhat kinds of information to disclose to parents.  Further, officials would be \nrequired to create systems to ensure that such disclosures were made, adding \nanother layer of complication to schools’ daily operation.  “Schools cannot be \nexpected to accommodate the personal, moral or religious concerns of every \nparent.  Such an obligation would not only contravene the educational mission of \nthe public schools, but also would be impossible to satisfy.”  Fields v. Palmdale \nSch. Dist., 427 F.3d 1197, 1206 (9th Cir. 2005), opinion reaff’d and amended on \ndenial of reh’g sub nom. Fields v. Palmdale Sch. Dist., 447 F.3d 1187 (9th Cir. \n2006). \nFinally, Plaintiffs’ rule requiring disclosure of information on students’ \ngender identity would force school officials to interfere with sensitive familial \nrelationships.  The question of whether and how to share information on one’s \ngender identity is deeply personal; as the district court recognized, such disclosures \nimplicate “many complicated and emotional issues” and may “evoke negative or \nharmful reactions.”  Foote v. Town of Ludlow, No. 22-cv-30041-MGM, 2022 WL \n18356421, at *8 (D. Mass. Dec. 14, 2022).  Were Plaintiffs to prevail, school \nofficials would be required to insert themselves into these highly sensitive \n12 \n\nCase: 23-1069     Document: 00118024852     Page: 23      Date Filed: 06/27/2023      Entry ID: 6576452\n \ndiscussions and to share information that should come from the child in the context \nof family conversations.  This kind of forced disclosure would have obvious \nnegative repercussions for children who are not yet ready to have this discussion \nwith their parents or who perceive their parents as unsupportive of their identity4—\nand if anything, this represents more of an intrusion on the parent-child \nrelationship than the restraint from such communications about which Plaintiffs \ncomplain.5  Conversely, Ludlow in this case worked to provide Plaintiffs’ child \nwith the time and support they needed to come out to their parents themselves.  \nWhen Plaintiffs’ child first informed a teacher of mental health issues and feelings \nof same-sex attraction, the teacher “offered to talk with Plaintiffs about those \n \n4   Cf.

If asking about a student’s \nsafety puts schools at risk of constitutional violations, schools will be severely \ndisincentivized to ask such questions—thus depriving students who may be \nsuffering of an invaluable source of support, care, and in some cases even \nprotection from abuse and neglect.

States Have An Interest In Making Schools A Safe And Supportive \nEnvironment For All Youth, Including Transgender Youth. \nStates have a strong interest in fostering safe and supportive schools for all \nchildren to learn, thrive, and grow into contributing members of society.  Safe and \nsupportive school environments that nurture the whole student, foster trusting \nrelationships, and promote a sense of belonging are a crucial component of both \nacademic outcomes and student well-being—particularly for transgender and \ngender-nonconforming youth.  Transgender youth often experience discrimination, \nharassment, and stigma, causing tangible mental and physical harm and restricting \ntheir ability to realize their potential.  Meanwhile, robust data confirm that \ntransgender students who feel safe expressing their gender identity at school are \nhappier, healthier, and more academically successful.  The experiences of Amici \nStates and other jurisdictions show that policies and practices that support all facets \nof students’ identities and facilitate trusting student-teacher relationships are \nbeneficial for all students, including and especially transgender and gender-\nnonconforming youth. \nA.  All students benefit from safe and supportive schools. \nCourts have recognized that the States’ responsibility to provide public \neducation encompasses protecting students from harm.

While there is no exhaustive list of what constitutes a \nsafe and supportive educational environment, research has emphasized both \nphysical safety and security alongside emotional well-being, connectedness of staff \nand students, and norms and policies.9  This framework is heavily supported by \nextensive developmental science and neuroscience research affirming that \neducational environment and school culture influence many facets of a child’s \ndevelopment, including social-emotional and academic learning.10  In contrast, fear \n \n7   See, e.g., Safe & Supportive Schools, Office of Elementary and Secondary \nEd.

For example, the Massachusetts Department \nof Elementary and Secondary Education guidance to school districts from which \nLudlow derived its policy outlines anti-discrimination compliance vis-à-vis gender \nidentity in the context of a safe and supportive school, recognizing the deeply \npersonal nature of decisions related to sharing gender identity and explaining best \npractices.51  The guidelines indicate that the best practice is to engage the student \nin discussion regarding aspects of the school experience such as name and pronoun \nusage, and that—because some transgender and gender non-conforming students \nare not openly so at home, due to safety concerns or otherwise—such \nconversations should occur before discussing a student’s gender nonconformity \nwith that student’s parent or guardian.52  Similarly, California’s Department of \nEducation guidelines “support[] healthy communication between educators, \n \n50   See, e.g., Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 76, § 5; Cal. Educ. Code § 220; Equality \nMaps: Safe Schools Laws, Movement Advancement Project (2022), \nhttps://www.lgbtmap.org/equality-maps/safe_school_laws (“nondiscrimination” \ntab) (compiling laws of all states). \n51   See Guidance for Massachusetts Public Schools Creating a Safe and \nSupportive School Environment, Mass.

Illinois, 405 U.S. 645, 651 (1972) (quoting \nMeyer  v.  Nebraska,  262 U.S.  390,  399  (1923)  and  May  v.  Anderson, \n345 U.S. 528, 533 (1953)). \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \n  Our constitutional system has “historically … recognized that the \nnatural bonds of affection lead parents to act in the best interests of their \nchildren.”  Parham v. J.R., 442 U.S. 584, 602 (1979).  So without a reason \nto believe a parent is unfit, courts presume that the State may not “inject \nitself into the private realm of the family [and] question the ability of that \nparent to make the best decisions concerning the rearing of [their] chil-\ndren.”  Troxel v. Granville, 530 U.S. 57, 68–69 (2000) (plurality op.) (cit-\ning Reno v. Flores, 507 U.S. 292, 304 (1993)).  And that presumption is \n   \n\nCase: 23-1069     Document: 00117988127     Page: 8      Date Filed: 03/20/2023      Entry ID: 6556542\nnot overcome “[s]imply because the decision of a parent [about a child’s \nmedical treatment] is not agreeable to [the] child or because it involves \nrisks.”  See Parham, 442 U.S. at 603.  School districts can’t shut a parent \nout of their child’s decision about their gender identity because the child \nobjects or because the school believes the parent isn’t supportive enough \nof an immediate gender transition. \nDuring the 2020-21 school year, Stephen Foote and Marissa Silves-\ntri (“Appellants”) sent their children—B.F., an eleven-year-old girl, and \nG.F., a twelve-year-old boy—to Ludlow Public Schools.  In December \n2020, they learned that B.F. talked with one of her teachers about de-\npression, low self-esteem, and possible same-sex attraction.  Appx.26–28, \n¶¶ 58–68.  Afterwards, Silvestri emailed B.F.’s other teachers, informing \nthem that they would be getting B.F. professional help and asking that \nno one “have any private conversations with B.[F.] in regards to this mat-\nter.”  Appx.28, ¶ 70.  But when B.F. emailed her teachers that she iden-\ntified as “genderqueer” two months later, a school counselor disregarded \nthat request and met privately with B.F.  Appx.31–32, ¶ 81.  After that \nmeeting, the counselor emailed school staff and told them to conceal \nB.F.’s new name and pronouns from her parents.  Appx.32, ¶ 82. \n2 \n\nCase: 23-1069     Document: 00117988127     Page: 9      Date Filed: 03/20/2023      Entry ID: 6556542\nAround that time, Appellants learned that their son, G.F., had also \nexpressed an alternate gender identity.  Appx.30–31, ¶¶ 78–80.  As it \nhappens, the school’s librarian—who was affiliated with Translate Gen-\nder, an organization that shares resources about gender and gender iden-\ntity, see Appx.40, ¶¶ 116–17—was meeting secretly with both G.F. and \nB.F.  Appx.25, ¶ 53.  In these meetings, the librarian actively promoted \ngender experimentation.  See Appx.25–26, ¶ 52–55.  And earlier in the \nschool year, he gave students in B.F.’s sixth grade class an assignment to \nmake biographical videos, where he invited students to include their gen-\nder identity and preferred pronouns in their videos.  See Appx.24, ¶¶ 47–\n50.  He also encouraged B.F. to visit Translate Gender’s website.  See \nAppx.40, ¶¶ 116–17. \nAppellants complained that Ludlow’s personnel had concealed crit-\nical information about B.F. and G.F., but the administration brushed \naside the parents’ concerns and defended the actions as consistent with \nschool policy.  See Appx.154–55.  School officials, moreover, publicly ma-\nligned Appellants’ assertion of parental rights as “thinly-veiled intoler-\nance.”  Appx.155.  Even though the district court rejected Appellants’ \nclaims, it agreed that “it is disconcerting that school administrators or a \n3 \n\nCase: 23-1069     Document: 00117988127     Page: 10      Date Filed: 03/20/2023      Entry ID: 6556542\nschool  committee adopted  and  implemented  a  policy requiring  school \nstaff to actively hide information from parents about something of im-\nportance regarding their child.”  Appx.164.  But the school’s actions aren’t \nsimply disconcerting—they’re disturbing.   \nLudlow’s policy violates parents’ fundamental right “to direct the \nupbringing of their children”—“perhaps the oldest of the fundamental \nliberty interests recognized by [the Supreme] Court.”  Troxel, 530 U.S. at \n65.  The school’s actions violated Appellants’ substantive due process \nrights by withholding information about whether their child has taken \nany action concerning his or her gender identity, leaving parents com-\npletely in the dark about their child’s mental and emotional well-being.  \nAnd this is no isolated occurrence: school districts across the country \nhave adopted similar policies under the mistaken belief that to do other-\nwise would be unlawful.  \nThe district court erred by misapplying this Court’s shock the con-\nscience standard for constitutional liability under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.  Be-\ncause Appellees “had an opportunity to reflect and make reasoned and \nrational decisions[,] their deliberately indifferent behavior toward Appel-\nlants was sufficient to shock the conscience.”  Rivera v. Rhode Island, \n4 \n\nCase: 23-1069     Document: 00117988127     Page: 11      Date Filed: 03/20/2023      Entry ID: 6556542\n402 F.3d 27, 36 (1st Cir. 2005) (quotations omitted) (emphasis added).  \nInstead  of  applying  (or  even  considering)  the  deliberate  indifference \nstandard, the court applied the version of the shock-the-conscience test \nreserved for situations, unlike here, “where government officials must act \nin haste, under pressure, and without an opportunity for reflection.” Gon-\nzalez-Fuentes v. Molina, 607 F.3d 864, 881 (1st Cir. 2010) (quotations \nomitted).  Under the deliberate indifference standard, Appellants’ allega-\ntions suffice to survive a motion to dismiss.  Given that “whether behav-\nior is conscience shocking varies with regard to the circumstances of the \ncase,” Rivera, 402 F.3d at 36, the district court’s failure to even consider \nthe deliberate indifference analysis, at a minimum, warrants remand.  \nARGUMENT \n  This Court reviews a district court’s dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) \nde novo and asks whether the well-pleaded facts, taken as true, justify \nrecovery on any supportable legal theory.  Mason v. Morrisette, 403 F.3d \n28, 30 (1st Cir. 2005).   \nI.  Parents Possess a Longstanding, Fundamental Right to Di-\nrect the Care and Custody of Their Children. \nUnder the Fourteenth Amendment, States may not “deprive any \nperson of … liberty … without due process of law.”  U.S. Const. amend. \n5 \n\nCase: 23-1069     Document: 00117988127     Page: 12      Date Filed: 03/20/2023      Entry ID: 6556542\nXIV.  The Amendment’s Due Process Clause “provides heightened pro-\ntection against government interference with certain fundamental rights \nand liberty interests,” see Troxel, 530 U.S. at 65 (quoting Washington v. \nGlucksberg, 521 U.S. 702, 720 (1997))—including those unenumerated \nrights that are “deeply rooted in this Nation’s history and tradition,” see \nDobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Org., 142 S. Ct. 2228, 2242 (2022) \n(quoting Glucksberg, 521 U.S. at 721). \nThe right of parents to direct the care and custody of their children \n“is perhaps the oldest of the fundamental liberty interests recognized by \n[the Supreme] Court.”  Troxel, 530 U.S. at 65; see also Pierce v. Soc’y of \nSisters, 268 U.S. 510, 535 (1925) (declaring that “the child is not the mere \ncreature of the State,” but rather “those who nurture him and direct his \ndestiny have the right, coupled with the high duty, to recognize and pre-\npare him for additional obligations”).  And over the last century, the Su-\npreme  Court  has  reaffirmed  that  right  time  and  again.    See  Meyer, \n262 U.S. at 399 (the Due Process Clause protects parents’ right to “estab-\nlish a home and bring up children”); Pierce, 268 U.S. at 534–35 (the “lib-\nerty of parents and guardians” includes the right “to direct the upbring-\ning  and  education  of  children  under  their  control”);  Prince  v. \n6 \n\nCase: 23-1069     Document: 00117988127     Page: 13      Date Filed: 03/20/2023      Entry ID: 6556542\nMassachusetts, 321 U.S. 158, 166 (1944) (“It is cardinal with us that the \ncustody, care and nurture of the child reside first in the parents, whose \nprimary function and freedom include preparation for obligations the \nstate can neither supply nor hinder.”); Stanley, 405 U.S. at 651 (raising \none’s children has been deemed an “essential” and “basic civil right[] of \nman” (citation and quotation marks omitted)); see Dobbs, 142 S. Ct. at \n2257 (identifying, among a list of longstanding rights, “the right to make \ndecisions about the education of one’s children”).  Nearly a century after \nMeyer, this much is clear: “Th[e] primary role of the parents in the up-\nbringing of their children is now established beyond debate as an endur-\ning American tradition.”  Wisconsin v. Yoder, 406 U.S. 205, 232 (1972). \nThat parental authority is based on the commonsense recognition \n“that parents possess what a child lacks in maturity, experience, and ca-\npacity for judgment required for making life’s difficult decisions.”  Par-\nham, 442 U.S. at 602.  The law thus makes a basic assumption about \nchildren as a class: “[It] assumes that they do not yet act as adults do, \nand  thus  [it]  act[s]  in  their  interest  by  restricting  certain  choices \nthat … they are not yet ready to make with full benefit of the costs and \nbenefits attending such decisions.”  Thompson v. Oklahoma, 487 U.S. \n7 \n\nCase: 23-1069     Document: 00117988127     Page: 14      Date Filed: 03/20/2023      Entry ID: 6556542\n815, 826 n.23 (1988).  That basic assumption restricts minor children’s \nrights in myriad ways, such as restricting their right to vote, see U.S. \nConst. amend. XXVI, their right to enlist in the military without parental \nconsent, see 10 U.S.C. § 505, or their right to drink alcohol, see, e.g., \n23 U.S.C. § 158.  And that same principle is traditionally at work in pub-\nlic schools, which routinely require parental consent before a student can \nreceive medication or participate in certain school activities. \nTo be sure, this broad parental authority is not absolute—parents \nhave no license to abuse or neglect their children.  See Parham, 442 U.S. \nat 602–04.  Nor does the parental relationship give parents the right to \ndisregard lawful limitations on the use of medical procedures or drugs. \nSee Doe v. Pub. Health Tr., 696 F.2d 901, 903 (11th Cir. 1983) (“John \nDoe’s rights to make decisions for his daughter can be no greater than \nhis rights to make medical decisions for himself.”).  Relatedly, some pa-\nrental decisions concerning their child’s medical care may be “subject to \na physician’s independent examination and medical judgment.”  Parham, \n442 U.S. at 604; but see id. (“[Yet parents] retain a substantial, if not the \ndominant, role in the decision, absent a finding of neglect or abuse, and \nthe traditional presumption that the parents act in the best interests of \n8 \n\nCase: 23-1069     Document: 00117988127     Page: 15      Date Filed: 03/20/2023      Entry ID: 6556542\ntheir child should apply.”).  But parents are not stripped of their author-\nity to act in the best interest of their children “[s]imply because the[ir] \ndecision … is not agreeable to a child or because it involves risks.”  See \nid. at 603–04 (“Most children, even in adolescence, simply are not able to \nmake sound judgments concerning many decisions, including their need \nfor medical care or treatment.  Parents can and must make those judg-\nments.”).  Indeed, “a fit parent”—i.e., a parent who “adequately cares for \nhis or her children”—is presumed to “act in the best interest of his or her \nchild.”  Troxel, 530 U.S. at 68–69. \nWhen a school district’s legitimate policies “conflict with the funda-\nmental right of parents to raise and nurture their child,” “the primacy of \nthe parents’ authority must be recognized and should yield only where \nthe school’s action is tied to a compelling interest.”  Gruenke v. Seip, \n225 F.3d 290, 305 (3d Cir. 2000).  But school districts have no interest—\nmuch less a compelling one—in actively concealing minor students’ gen-\nder transitions from their parents. \n \n \n \n9 \n\nCase: 23-1069     Document: 00117988127     Page: 16      Date Filed: 03/20/2023      Entry ID: 6556542\nII.  Ludlow’s Actions and Policies Violated Appellants’ Funda-\nmental Right to Care for Their Children. \nA. Ludlow authorized school officials to make decisions \nabout a child’s gender identity behind parents’ backs. \nIn 2012, the Massachusetts Legislature amended the student anti-\ndiscrimination statute to include gender identity as a protected class.  See \nH.B. 3810, 2011 Reg. Sess., ch. 199 (Mass. 2011) (effective July 1, 2012).  \nOn the heels of that update, the Massachusetts Board of Elementary and \nSecondary Education revised the affected regulations and directed the \nDepartment of Elementary and Secondary Education (“DESE”) to pro-\nvide guidance to school districts to help implement those revised regula-\ntions.  See Appx.17, ¶¶ 22–23.  As requested, DESE published a guidance \ndocument that suggested school policies and procedures to address these \nlegal and regulatory changes.  See Appx.17, ¶ 24.   \nThat guidance, which does not carry the force of law, encourages \nschools to accept a student’s assertion of his or her gender identity when \nthe student consistently and uniformly asserts a specific gender identity \nor when there is evidence that the identity is sincerely held as part of the \nstudent’s core identity.  Guidance for Massachusetts Public Schools Cre-\nating a Safe and Supportive School Environment: Nondiscrimination on \n10 \n\nCase: 23-1069     Document: 00117988127     Page: 17      Date Filed: 03/20/2023      Entry ID: 6556542\nthe Basis of Gender Identity, MASS. DEP’T OF ELEMENTARY & SECONDARY \nEDUC., https://www.doe.mass.edu/sfs/lgbtq/GenderIdentity.html.  It fur-\nther recommends that “[s]chool personnel … speak with the student first \nbefore discussing a student’s gender nonconformity or transgender status \nwith the student’s parent or guardian.”  Id. \nRather than encouraging personnel to speak with students before \ntalking with parents, as DESE’s guidance suggests, Ludlow implemented \na policy forbidding school personnel from notifying parents regarding a \nstudent’s gender identity issues—at all—unless the student consents.  \nSee Appx.20, ¶¶ 34–36.  Appellees implemented this policy across all \nLudlow public schools, requiring all personnel to conceal information re-\ngarding a student’s transgender status from their parents, including the \nuse of alternative names or pronouns, unless the student consents.  See \nAppx.21–22, ¶¶ 37–40.  And the policy provides that personnel should \n“deliberately deceive parents” by using the student’s birth name and pro-\nnouns in their parents’ presence and using the alternative name and pro-\nnouns elsewhere.  Id.  Under Ludlow’s policy, students of any age can \n11 \n\nCase: 23-1069     Document: 00117988127     Page: 18      Date Filed: 03/20/2023      Entry ID: 6556542\ninsist that their parents are kept in the dark about their transgender \nstatus, even when they must get parental consent for lesser matters.1   \nLudlow’s policy gives ultimate decisionmaking authority to children \nand displaces parents of their longstanding, primary role in ensuring \ntheir child’s safety and well-being.  Now, the question is, do schools have \nan obligation to facilitate the immediate transition of a student who be-\nlieves they are transgender and to hide this change from parents who \naren’t on board?  The answer is obviously: No.  As a recent review of youth \ngender treatments recognized, “[s]ocial transition” is “an active interven-\ntion because it may have significant effects on the child or young person \nin terms of their psychological functioning.”2  Ludlow presumably does \nnot treat a child’s depression or other mental health issues without in-\nvolving parents, and it has no duty or right to keep parents in the dark \nabout gender-related distress either.  \n \n1 One rightly fears what’s next.  See After Being Denied Tattoo, Sixth \nGrader Decides to Have Gender Reassignment Surgery Instead, THE BAB-\nYLON BEE (Apr. 13, 2022).  After all, today’s satire too often becomes to-\nmorrow’s reality. \n2 Independent Review of Gender Identity Services for Children and Young \nPeople:  Interim  Report  (The  Cass  Review),  Feb.  2022,  at  62, \nhttps://perma.cc/D5XP-EXAL. \n12 \n\nCase: 23-1069     Document: 00117988127     Page: 19      Date Filed: 03/20/2023      Entry ID: 6556542\nWorse  still,  Ludlow’s  ‘immediate  transition’  approach  lacks  any \nsolid, scientific foundation.  Many medical professionals believe that this \napproach “can become self-reinforcing and do long term harm.”  Luke \nBerg, How Schools’ Transgender Policies Are Eroding Parents’ Rights, at \n3, (Mar. 2022).3  Given the recent explosion of students dealing with gen-\nder identity issues, there is a greater need for caution.  See id.  Not only \nthat, but existing research suggests that these feelings eventually recede \nfor most children—that is, for those who do not transition.  See id.  Even \nso, there are a growing number of “detransitioners,” which further sup-\nports a cautious, rather than hasty, approach.  See id. (citing Elie Van-\ndenbussche, Detransition-Related Needs and Support: A Cross-Sectional \nOnline Survey, 69 J. HOMOSEXUALITY 1602 (2021)). \n \n3 See, e.g., Kenneth J. Zucker, The Myth of Persistence: A Response to “A \nCritical  Commentary  on  Follow-Up  Studies  and  ‘Desistance’  Theories \nAbout Transgender and Gender Non-Conforming Children” by Temple \nNewhook et al. (2018), INT’L J. OF TRANSGENDERISM, at 7 (arguing that \n“parents who support, implement, or encourage a gender social transition \n(and clinicians who recommend one) are implementing a psychosocial \ntreatment that will increase the odds of long-term persistence”). \n13 \n\nCase: 23-1069     Document: 00117988127     Page: 20      Date Filed: 03/20/2023      Entry ID: 6556542\nB. The District Court incorrectly applied the “shock the \nconscience” standard. \nAppellants properly alleged facts showing that Ludlow deliberately \nviolated their fundamental right to direct the care and custody of their \nchildren.  See, e.g., Troxel, 530 U.S. at 65; Parham, 442 U.S. at 603; \nGlucksberg, 521 U.S. at 722.  Yet the district court determined that those \nfacts didn’t satisfy the “shock the conscience” standard for claims under \n42 U.S.C. § 1983 because the decision to withhold information about B.F. \nand G.F. from Appellants was not “so extreme, egregious, or outrageously \noffensive as to shock the contemporary conscience.”  Appx.167 (quotation \nomitted).  But this misunderstands and misapplies the shock the con-\nscience standard. \nExecutive  action  violates  substantive  due  process  “when  it  ‘can \nproperly be characterized as arbitrary, or conscience shocking, in a con-\nstitutional  sense.’”    Cnty.  of  Sacramento  v.  Lewis,  523 U.S.  833,  847 \n(1998)  (quoting  Collins  v.  City  of  Harker  Heights,  503 U.S.  115,  128 \n(1992)).  But the difficulty lies in the fact that “the measure of what is \nconscience-shocking is no calibrated yard stick.”  Id.  Indeed, this Court \nhas said that “[d]escriptions of what actions qualify as ‘conscience-shock-\ning’ often descend into a morass of adjectives that are as nebulous as they \n14 \n\nCase: 23-1069     Document: 00117988127     Page: 21      Date Filed: 03/20/2023      Entry ID: 6556542\nare pejorative, including ‘truly irrational,’ ‘extreme and egregious,’ ‘truly \noutrageous,  uncivilized,  and  intolerable,’  and  ‘stunning.’”    Gonzalez-\nFuentes,  607 F.3d  at  880  (citations  omitted);  see  also  Kennedy  v. \nRidgefield City, 439 F.3d 1055, 1064–65 (9th Cir. 2006) (stating that “the \nuse of subjective epithets as ‘gross’ ‘reckless’ and ‘shocking’ sheds more \nheat than light on the thought process courts must undertake”).   \nThis Court has recognized that “whether behavior is conscience \nshocking varies with regard to the circumstances of the case.”  Rivera, \n402 F.3d at 36; see also Coyne v. Cronin, 386 F.3d 280, 288 (1st Cir. 2004) \n(“The conscience-shocking standard is not a monolith; its rigorousness \nvaries  from  context to  context.”).  Lewis  defined  those  circumstances \nalong a spectrum of constitutional liability: beginning with negligence \nand ending with intentional conduct.  See 523 U.S. at 849–50.  On one \nend, “liability for negligently inflicted harm is categorically beneath the \nthreshold of constitutional due process.”  Id. at 849 (emphasis added).  On \nthe other, “conduct intended to injure in some way unjustifiable by any \ngovernment interest is the sort of official action most likely to rise to the \nconscience-shocking level.”  Id.; see also Daniels v. Williams, 474 U.S. \n327, 331 (1986) (“Historically, this guarantee of due process has been \n15 \n\nCase: 23-1069     Document: 00117988127     Page: 22      Date Filed: 03/20/2023      Entry ID: 6556542\napplied to deliberate decisions of government officials to deprive a person \nof life, liberty, or property.”). \nBut between these two poles lies “recklessness” or “gross negli-\ngence,” which, depending on the circumstances, may result in a due pro-\ncess violation.  See Lewis, 523 U.S. at 849–50; see also Gonzalez-Fuentes, \n607 F.3d at 881 (“Anything between those two poles is ‘a matter for closer \ncalls.’” (quoting Lewis, 523 U.S. at 849)).  Lewis noted, for example, that \nprison officials’ “deliberately indifferent” conduct towards the medical \nneeds of prisoners fell into this middle category and satisfied the consti-\ntutional fault requirement for a due process violation.  523 U.S. at 850 \n(citing, e.g., Barrie v. Grand Cnty., Utah, 119 F.3d 862, 867 (10th Cir. \n1997); Weyant v. Okst, 101 F.3d 845, 856 (2nd Cir. 1996)).  So, govern-\nmental actions—even those not specifically intended to violate constitu-\ntional rights—may be evaluated for substantive due process liability un-\nder the deliberate indifference standard.  But see id. (recognizing that \ndue process rules aren’t “subject to mechanical application in unfamiliar \nterritory,” but instead “demand[] an exact analysis of circumstances be-\nfore any abuse of power is condemned as conscience-shocking”).   \n16 \n\nCase: 23-1069     Document: 00117988127     Page: 23      Date Filed: 03/20/2023      Entry ID: 6556542\n  This Court has held that one relevant circumstance in the shock-\nthe-conscience analysis is whether the government official had an oppor-\ntunity to reflect before acting.  Welch v. City of Biddeford Police Dep’t, \n12 F.4th 70, 76 (1st Cir. 2021) (“[W]here officials have the opportunity to \nmake unhurried judgments, deliberate indifference may shock the con-\nscience ….”); accord Gonzalez-Fuentes, 607 F.3d at 881 (“[I]n situations \n‘where actual deliberation on the part of a governmental defendant is \npractical, the  defendant  may  be held  to have  engaged  in  conscience-\nshocking activity’ by exercising ‘deliberate indifference.’” (quoting Coyne, \n386 F.3d at 288)).   \nThose situations stand in stark contrast to “situations ‘where gov-\nernment officials must act in haste, under pressure, and without an op-\nportunity for reflection,”—in such situations, “even applications of deadly \nforce by those officials cannot be conscience-shocking unless undertaken \nmaliciously and sadistically for the very purpose of causing harm.’” Gon-\nzalez-Fuentes, 607 F.3d at 881 (quoting Coyne, 386 F.3d at 288).  These \nsituations appear most often in the context of law enforcement.  And be-\ncause law enforcement personnel in these high-pressure situations “have \nobligations that tend to tug against each other,” the standard for due \n17 \n\nCase: 23-1069     Document: 00117988127     Page: 24      Date Filed: 03/20/2023      Entry ID: 6556542\nprocess liability in these situations is higher than deliberate indifference.  \nSee Lewis, 523 U.S. at 853; Coyne, 386 F.3d at 288; see also Whitley v. \nAlbers, 475 U.S. 312, 320 (1986) (higher standard of fault than deliberate \nindifference must be shown for officer liability in a prison riot).  Ludlow’s \nactions are thus entitled to less deference than that afforded to law en-\nforcement’s split-second decisions.   \n  Not only does the nature of the decision matter—i.e., high-pressure \ndecisions or unhurried judgments—but the question “whether behavior \nis conscience-shocking may be informed in some cases by the nature of \nthe right violated.”4  See Martinez v. Hongyi Cui, 608 F.3d 54, 66 (1st Cir. \n2010) (citing Lewis, 523 U.S. at 847 n.8).  And here, Appellants seek to \nvindicate their rights by ensuring that school personnel provide them \nwith the information necessary to help their children navigate potentially \nlife-altering decisions regarding their gender identity.  Yoder, 406 U.S. at \n232 (“primary role of the parents in the upbringing of their children is \nnow established beyond debate as an enduring American tradition.”); \n \n4 See also Dubbs v. Head Start, Inc., 336 F.3d 1194, 1203 (10th Cir. 2003) \n(explaining that while Lewis’s “shocks the conscience” standard applies \nto  tortious  conduct  under  the  Fourteenth  Amendment,  “it  does \nnot … eliminate more categorical protection for ‘fundamental rights’ as \ndefined by the tradition and experience of the nation”).   \n18 \n\nCase: 23-1069     Document: 00117988127     Page: 25      Date Filed: 03/20/2023      Entry ID: 6556542\nTroxel, 530 U.S. at 65 (explaining that parents’ right to direct the care \nand custody of their children “is perhaps the oldest of the fundamental \nliberty interests recognized by [the Supreme] Court”).  Without any ur-\ngent need to facilitate a student’s immediate transition—a particularly \nchallenging  showing  with  presumptively  “fit  parent[s],”  see  Troxel, \n530 U.S. at 68–69—actively concealing important information from par-\nents about their child’s well-being should shock the conscience.  \nThe district court itself recognized troubling nature of Ludlow’s ac-\ntions, finding it “disconcerting that school administrators or a school com-\nmittee adopted and implemented a policy requiring school staff to ac-\ntively hide information from parents about something of importance re-\ngarding their child.”  Appx.164.  Even so, it found that the countervailing \n“government interest in providing students with a school environment in \nwhich they may safely express their gender identities” weighed in favor \nof finding that Ludlow’s actions didn’t satisfy the shock-the-conscience \nstandard.  Appx.163; see also Appx.163–67.  But this misunderstands the \nnature of parents’ fundamental right here: to be informed of critical in-\nformation about their child’s mental health and well-being.  Absent some \nreason to believe Appellants are unfit—such as evidence of abuse or \n19 \n\nCase: 23-1069     Document: 00117988127     Page: 26      Date Filed: 03/20/2023      Entry ID: 6556542\nneglect—Ludlow’s personnel had no right to conceal this information \nfrom Appellants.  See Troxel, 530 U.S. at 68–69. \nNor can Ludlow hide behind a government policy to lessen the mag-\nnitude of its actions.  See Irish v. Fowler, 979 F.3d 65, 74 (1st Cir. 2020) \n(“In evaluating whether the defendant’s actions shocked the conscience, \nwe also consider whether the defendants violated state law or proper po-\nlice procedures and training.”).  As the district court found, Ludlow “ig-\nnored the plain language [of DESE guidance] advising that parents be \ninformed.”  Appx.166 (citation omitted).  Not only that, but the district \ncourt also admitted that it was “apprehensive about the alleged policy \nand actions of the Ludlow Public Schools with regard to parental notifi-\ncation.”  Appx.167.   \nEven so, the district court found that the facts didn’t satisfy its per-\nception of the shock-the-conscience standard.  See Appx166–67.  But no-\nwhere in its analysis did it even mention or consider the deliberate indif-\nference standard.  Instead, the court relied on a string of “adjectives that \nare as nebulous as they are pejorative,” see Gonzalez-Fuentes, 607 F.3d \nat 880—looking for conduct that was “stunning,” “brutal and inhumane,” \nor “extreme, egregious, or outrageously offensive,” see Appx.162, 167—to \n20 \n\nCase: 23-1069     Document: 00117988127     Page: 27      Date Filed: 03/20/2023      Entry ID: 6556542\nfind that Ludlow’s actions didn’t shock the conscience.  And it failed en-\ntirely to consider the difference between situations, like here, where ac-\ntors have an opportunity to reflect and make unhurried judgments and \nsituations, unlike here, where government officials must act in haste, un-\nder pressure, and without an opportunity for reflection.  See Appx163–\n67.  Appellants alleged facts that plausibly satisfy the deliberate indiffer-\nence standard for due process liability.  At a minimum, this Court should \nremand  the  case  to  the  district  court  with  instructions  to  consider \nwhether Appellants plausibly alleged facts sufficient satisfy the deliber-\native indifference standard.   \nC. School districts across the country have adopted paren-\ntal exclusion policies. \n  Regrettably, Ludlow’s policy is neither groundbreaking nor unique.  \nIn recent years, school districts nationwide have quietly implemented \nsimilar gender transition guidelines.  These parental exclusion policies \ndiffer in execution—i.e., whether they place students or school officials in \nthe driver’s seat—but they both relegate parents to the back seat.  All \nsuch policies thus prevent parents from helping their children make cru-\ncial decisions about their identity and mental health, in direct violation \nof parents’ fundamental rights.  Parham, 442 U.S. at 603. \n21 \n\nCase: 23-1069     Document: 00117988127     Page: 28      Date Filed: 03/20/2023      Entry ID: 6556542\nSome policies leave parental involvement to the student’s discre-\ntion.  These policies forbid school officials from disclosing information \nabout a student’s transgender status to parents unless the student has \nauthorized the disclosure.  Policies like this have shown up in large cities \nlike Washington, D.C.,5 Philadelphia,6 Chicago,7 and Los Angeles,8 as \nwell as smaller cities like Eau Claire, Wisconsin.9  And the New Jersey \n \n5  See  D.C.

Gloucester Cnty. Sch. Bd., \n972 F.3d 586, 620 (4th Cir. 2020), cert. denied, 141 S. Ct. 2878 (2021).  Parents have the \nconstitutional right to determine which schools their children attend but they do not have the right \nto prior notice of and an exemption from their children’s gender identity, or to prior notice and an \nexemption from a school district’s intent (and obligation) to not discriminate against a transgender \nstudent.  Plaintiffs’ Amended Complaint rests on an assertion of these rights and should be \ndismissed.   \nFACTS \nSolely for purposes of defendants’ motion to dismiss pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 12(b)(6), defendants accept as true the facts, as opposed to conclusions, alleged in \nplaintiffs’ Amended Complaint.  Defendants note that both the conclusory and factual allegations \n655995 \n\n \ncontained in the Amended Complaint are inaccurate and misleading.  Defendants only accept the \nfactual allegations in the Amended Complaint to the extent that they must do so for the limited \npurposes of this motion.  \nThe Amended Complaint alleges that the Town of Ludlow, through its school committee \nhas adopted a “Protocol” that “parents are not to be informed of their child’s transgender status \nand gender-affirming social transition . . . unless the child, of any age, consents.”  Amended \nComplaint at ¶ 36.  It alleges that the children of plaintiffs, Stephen Foote (“Foote”) and Marissa \nSilvestri (“Silvestri”), “G.F.” and “B.F.,” were 11 and 12 years old, respectively, at the time of the \nalleged events.  See Amended Complaint at ¶¶ 58, 93, 97, 111. \nOn February 28, 2021, without the knowledge of their parents, “B.F.” sent an email to \ndefendants Foley and Gazda, and teachers at “B.F.’s” middle school, asserting: \nHello everyone, If you are reading this you are either my teacher or guidance \ncounselor.  I  have  an  announcement  to  make  and  I  trust  you  guys  with  this \ninformation. I am genderqueer. Basically, it means I use any pronouns (other than \nit/its). This also means I have a name change. My new name will be R****. Please \ncall me by that name. If you deadname1 me or use any pronouns I am not \ncomfortable with I will politely tell you. I am telling you this because I feel like I \ncan trust you. A list of pronouns you can use are: she/her he/him they/them  \nfae/faerae/aer ve/ver xe/xem ze/zir. I have added a link so you can look \nat how to say them. Please only use the ones I have listed and not the \nother ones. I do not like them. Thank you. R*** F***. \n \nAmended Complaint at ¶ 81.   \n“B.F.’s” sibling, “G.F.” also asserted their gender identity.  See Id. at 115.  Defendants \naccepted “B.F.” and “G.F.’s” assertions of their gender identities.  See, e.g., Amended Complaint \nat ¶¶ 79, 83, 85.  “B.F.” and “G.F.” requested that their parents not be told of their gender identities  \n \n1 Merriam-Webster defines “deadname” as “the name that a transgender person was given at \nbirth  and  no  longer  uses  upon  transitioning.”    https://www.merriam-\nwebster.com/dictionary/deadname (last visited July 29, 2022).   \nPage 2 of 29 \n655995 \n\n \nand that their birth names and corresponding pronouns be used in communications with their \nparents.  See Id.  Defendants complied.  See Id.   \nSTANDARD OF REVIEW \nA.  Motion to Dismiss Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1).   \nIt is well-established that “[t]he party invoking federal court jurisdiction bears the burden \nof proving its existence.”  Pejepscot Indus. Park v. Me. Cent. R.R. Co., 215 F.3d 195, 200 (1st Cir. \n2000) (citation omitted).  Further: \nIt is black-letter law that \"federal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction, and thus \nmust take pains to act only within the margins of that jurisdiction.\" Cumberland \nFarms, Inc. v. Me. Tax Assessor, 116 F.3d 943, 945 (1st Cir. 1997). Hence, the \npreferred -- and often the obligatory -- practice is that a court, when confronted with \na colorable challenge to its subject-matter jurisdiction, should resolve that question \nbefore weighing the merits of a pending action. See Berner v. Delahanty, 129 F.3d \n20, 23 (1st Cir. 1997); see also Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Environment, 523 \nU.S. 83, 94, 140 L. Ed. 2d 210, 118 S. Ct. 1003 (1998).  \n \nFeliciano v. Rullan, 303 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 2002).  In determining whether subject matter \njurisdiction exists, a court accepts all well-pleaded facts as true.  McCloskey v. Mueller, 446 F.3d \n262, 266 (1st Cir. 2006).  \n  \nB.  Motion to Dismiss Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). \nThe standard of review announced by the Supreme Court of the United States in Bell \nAtlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544 (2007) and confirmed by Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, \n677-678 (2009) requires that: \nTo state a claim, the complaint must \"contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as \ntrue, to 'state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face,'\" Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 129 \nS. Ct. 1937, 1949, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009) (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, \n550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007)); \"'naked assertions \ndevoid of further factual enhancement'\" need not be accepted, Maldonado v. \nFontanes, 568 F.3d 263, 266 (1st Cir. 2009) (quoting Iqbal, 129 S. Ct. at 1949); \nand  \"[i]f  the  factual  allegations  in  the  complaint  are  too  meager,  vague,  or \nconclusory to remove the possibility of relief from the realm of mere conjecture, \nthe complaint is open to dismissal,\" Tambone, 597 F.3d at 442. \nPage 3 of 29 \n655995 \n\n \n \nPlumbers' Union Local No. 12 Pension Fund v. Nomura Asset Acceptance Corp., 632 F.3d 762, \n771 (1st Cir. 2011).  In analyzing whether a complaint states a plausible claim for relief, “[t]o \nbegin, the court must strip away and discard the complaint's conclusory legal allegations. Next, \nthe court must determine whether the remaining factual content permits the reasonable inference \nthat the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.”  Shay v. Walters, 702 F.3d 76, 82 (1st Cir. \n2012) (citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted).   \nIn  deciding  the  motion,  the  Court  should  “eschew  any  reliance  on  bald  assertions, \nunsupportable conclusions, and ‘opprobrious epithets.’”  Chongris v. Bd. of Appeals of Town of \nAndover, 811 F.2d 36, 37 (1st Cir. 1987), quoting Snowden v. Hughes, 321 U.S. 1, 10 (1944). \nIn determining whether a complaint states a claim upon which relief can be granted, the \nCourt may consider documents relied on or attached to a complaint and matters of public record.  \nSee Lydon v. Local 103, Int'l. Bhd. of Elec. Workers, 770 F.3d 48, 53 (1st Cir. 2014); Trans-Spec \nTruck Serv. v. Caterpillar Inc., 524 F.3d 315, 321 (1st Cir. 2008); Watterson v. Page, 987 F.2d 1, \n3-4 (1st Cir. 1993). \nARGUMENT \nI.  Plaintiffs, Jonathan Feliciano and Sandra Salmeron’s, Claims Should Be Dismissed for \nLack of Standing.   \n \nPlaintiffs, Jonathan Feliciano (“Feliciano”) and Sandra Salmeron’s (“Salmeron”), claims \nare, at best, speculative and should be dismissed pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1).  “[A]t the pleading \nstage,  the  plaintiff  bears  the  burden  of  establishing  sufficient  factual  matter  to  plausibly \ndemonstrate  his  standing  to  bring  the  action.  Neither  conclusory  assertions  nor  unfounded \nspeculation can supply the necessary heft.”  Hochendoner v. Genzyme Corp., 823 F.3d 724, 731 \n(1st Cir. 2016).  “[S]tanding is not dispensed in gross.”  Id. at 733, quoting Lewis v. Casey, 518 \nPage 4 of 29 \n655995 \n\n \nU.S. 343, 358 n. 6 (1996).  “The appropriate inquiry must be ‘whether each particular plaintiff is \nentitled to have a federal court adjudicate each particular claim that he asserts.’”  Id., quoting \nPagán v. Calderón, 448 F.3d 16, 26 (1st Cir.2006).  The Amended Complaint does not allege facts \nthat plausibly demonstrate Feliciano and Salmeron’s standing to bring any claim. \nThe Amended Complaint provides almost no information regarding Feliciano or Salmeron, \nor their children.  It alleges that Feliciano and Salmeron are the parents of two children who attend \nLudlow public schools.  See Amended Complaint at ¶ 13.  It does not provide the children’s ages \nor the school(s) they attend.  Plaintiffs do not allege that Feliciano and Salmeron’s children are \ntransgender.  There is no allegation that Feliciano or Salmeron or their children have had any \ninteraction with any of the defendants.  Their claims depend on the allegations that: \n132. Because the intent of the Protocol is to conceal information from \nparents,  Plaintiffs  Feliciano  and  Salmeron  are  deliberately  hindered  from \nascertaining whether their children are being secretly socially transitioned, i.e., \nbeing provided mental health treatment, without their knowledge or consent. . . .  \n \n256. Defendants’ actions have caused a direct and immediate conflict with \nPlaintiffs’ religious beliefs by prohibiting them from being informed of mental \nhealth issues their children are or might be experiencing and by denying them the \nopportunity to seek counseling and guidance for their children in a manner that is \nconsistent with the beliefs sincerely held by their family instead of the government. \n \nAmended Complaint at ¶¶ 132, 256 (emphasis added).  Feliciano and Salmeron’s fear that their \nchildren may be transgender, that the defendants may know of it, and that defendants may be \nrespecting their children’s possible wishes that their parents not be told is insufficient to support \nstanding.   \nAs pled, there is no “case or controversy” within the meaning of Article III of the United \nStates Constitution for this Court to adjudicate.  See Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 498 (1975).  \nIn order to have standing, each plaintiff “must have (1) suffered an injury in fact, (2) that is fairly \ntraceable to the challenged conduct of the defendant, and (3) that is likely to be redressed by a \nPage 5 of 29 \n655995 \n\n \nfavorable judicial decision.  Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins, 578 U.S. 330, 338 (2016).  See also, Dantzler, \nInc. v. Empresas Berrios Inventory & Operations, Inc., 958 F.3d 38, 47 (1st Cir. 2020), cert. \ndenied sub nom. Dantzler, Inc. v. S2 Servs. Puerto Rico, LLC, 141 S. Ct. 2624 (2021).   \nThe Amended Complaint does not allege sufficient facts to plausibly demonstrate Feliciano \nand Salmeron suffered an injury in fact.  Showing an injury in fact requires each plaintiff to show \nthat  he  or  she  “suffered  ‘an  invasion  of  a  legally  protected  interest’  that  is  ‘concrete  and \nparticularized’ and ‘actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical.’”  Spokeo, 578 U.S. at \n339, quoting, Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555 (1992).  An injury is concrete only \nwhen it “actually exist[s].”  Id.  (citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted).  See also, \nDantzler, 958 F.3d at 47 (“An injury is ‘concrete’ if it is real, and not abstract”).   \nThe particularization requirement is a different matter: it necessitates that a plaintiff \nhas been affected “in a personal and individual way” by the injurious conduct.  \n[Spokeo, 136 S.Ct.] at 1548 (quoting Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560 n. 1, 112 S.Ct. 2130). \n \nThe  particularization  element  of  the  injury-in-fact  inquiry  reflects  the \ncommonsense notion that the party asserting standing must not only allege injurious \nconduct attributable to the defendant but also must allege that he, himself, is among \nthe persons injured by that conduct. See Lujan, 504 U.S. at 563, 112 S.Ct. 2130. \nThe requirement that a plaintiff must adduce facts demonstrating that he himself is \nadversely affected guarantees that “the decision as to whether review will be sought \n[is] in the hands of those who have a direct stake in the outcome,” Sierra Club v. \nMorton, 405 U.S. 727, 740, 92 S.Ct. 1361, 31 L.Ed.2d 636 (1972), and ensures that \ndisputes  are  settled  “in  a  concrete  factual  context  conducive  to  a  realistic \nappreciation of the consequences of judicial action,” Valley Forge Christian Coll. \nV. Ams. United for Separation of Church & State, Inc., 454 U.S. 464, 472, 102 S.Ct. \n752, 70 L.Ed.2d 700 (1982). \n \nHochendoner v. Genzyme Corp., 823 F.3d 724, 731–32 (1st Cir. 2016) (emphasis added).  The \nAmended  Complaint  will  not  support  an  inference  that  Feliciano  and  Salmeron  suffered  a \n“concrete and particularized” injury as a result of defendants’ alleged conduct.  As alleged, they \nhave not suffered an injury in fact and they lack standing to pursue their claims.   \nPage 6 of 29 \n655995 \n\n \n  The Amended Complaint also fails to satisfy the second element of the standing inquiry.  \n“The ‘traceability’ or causation element ‘requires the plaintiff to show a sufficiently direct causal \nconnection between the challenged action and the identified harm’ . . .  That connection ‘cannot \nbe overly attenuated.’”  Dantzler, 958 F.3d at 47, quoting Katz v. Pershing, LLC, 672 F.3d 64, 71 \n(1st Cir. 2012).  There are no facts pled in the Amended Complaint that could support the element \nof causation.  Therefore, Feliciano and Salmeron have failed to demonstrate standing.   \n  Finally, because Feliciano and Salmeron’s claims rest on, if anything, speculation and \nfactually unsupported fears, the Amended Complaint does not plausibly establish redressability.  \n“[T]he redressability element of standing requires that the plaintiff allege ‘that a favorable \nresolution of [its] claim would likely redress the professed injury’ . . .   This means that it cannot \nbe merely speculative that, if a court grants the requested relief, the injury will be redressed.”  Id., \nquoting Katz, 672 F.3d at 72.  There are no facts from which it can be inferred that a positive \noutcome for plaintiffs in this matter will have any impact on Feliciano and Salmeron whatsoever.  \nFeliciano and Salmeron lack standing and all of their claims should be dismissed.  To hold \notherwise would open the floodgates to all parents to file preemptive litigation in response to public \nschool policies with which they disagree.  Contrast, Norris on behalf of A.M. v. Cape Elizabeth \nSch. Dist., 969 F.3d 12, 29 (1st Cir. 2020), and cases cited (“The Supreme Court has repeatedly \nemphasized the necessary discretion school officials must exercise and the attendant deference \nowed to many of their decisions”). \n \n \n \n \nPage 7 of 29 \n655995 \n\n \nII.  The Amended Complaint Does Not State Claims Upon Which Relief Can Be Granted.   \n \n  Without waiving the foregoing, all of plaintiffs’ claims should be dismissed pursuant to \nRule 12(b)(6), as set forth below.  \nAt the outset, defendants note that the conclusion on which all of plaintiffs’ claims rest, that \nbeing transgender is a mental health condition, is used in the Amended Complaint as an epithet \nand is not entitled to a presumption of truth.  See Chongris, 811 F.2d at 37.   \nPlaintiffs’ conclusion is foreclosed by M.G.L. c. 112, § 275, which prohibits gender \nconversion therapy for patients under eighteen years old.  Specifically, it prohibits “sexual \norientation and gender identity change efforts,” defined as “any practice by a health care provider \nthat attempts or purports to impose change of an individual’s sexual orientation or gender identity.” \nSee M.G.L. c. 112, § 275.  Pursuant to the statute: \n(b) A health care provider shall not advertise for or engage in sexual orientation \nand gender identity change efforts with a patient who is less than 18 years of age. \n \n(c) A health care provider who violates this section shall be subject to discipline by \nthe  appropriate  licensing  board.  Such  discipline  may  include  suspension  or \nrevocation of license. \n \n(d) A violation of this section by a health care provider shall be a violation of section \n2 of chapter 93A. Such a claim brought under this section shall be subject to \nsections 5A and 7 of chapter 260. \n \nM.G.L. c. 112, § 275.  The conclusion that being transgender is a mental health condition in \nchildren is not entitled to a presumption of truth and is strongly contradicted by Massachusetts \nlaw. \nThe conclusion that being transgender is a mental illness is also implausible based on the \ngrowing judicial recognition of the nature of transgender identity.  See Doe by & through Doe v. \nBoyertown Area Sch. Dist., 897 F.3d 518, 522-524 (3d Cir. 2018), cert. denied, 139 S. Ct. 2636; \nPage 8 of 29 \n655995 \n\n \nGrimm v. Gloucester County School Board, 972 F.3d 586, 594-597 (4th Cir. 2020), cert. denied \n141 S. Ct. 2878. \nThe Fourth Circuit has found that “[j]ust like being cisgender,2 being transgender is natural \nand is not a choice.  Being transgender is also not a psychiatric condition, and implies no \nimpairment in judgment, stability, reliability, or general social or vocational capabilities.”  Grimm, \n972 F.3d at 594 (citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted).  “For many of us, gender \nidentity is established between the ages of three and four years old. . . . Thus, some transgender \nstudents enter the K-12 school system as their gender; others . . . begin to live their gender when \nthey are older.”  Id. at 596.  “[T]ransgender people constitute a discrete group with immutable \ncharacteristics: . . . [G]ender identity is formulated for most people at a very early age, and . . . \nbeing transgender is not a choice. Rather, it is as natural and immutable as being cisgender.”  Id. \nat 612-613.  Being transgender, without more, does not constitute a mental health condition.  \nPlaintiffs’ conclusory and implausible allegations to the contrary should be disregarded.   \nA.  Counts I-III Should Be Dismissed Based on the Doctrine of Qualified Immunity.  \nCounts I through III of the Amended Complaint, which are brought on behalf of all \nplaintiffs against all defendants, should be dismissed as against the individual defendants based on \nthe doctrine of qualified immunity.  There are two prongs to the qualified immunity analysis.  See \nFernandez-Salicrup v. Figueroa-Sancha, 790 F.3d 312, 325 (1st Cir. 2015).  “A court must decide: \n(1) whether the facts alleged or shown by the plaintiff make out a violation of a constitutional \nright; and (2) if so, whether the right was ‘clearly established’ at the time of the defendant’s alleged \n \n2 Merriam-Webster defines “cisgender” as “of, relating to, or being a person whose gender \nidentity corresponds  with  the  sex  the  person  had  or  was  identified  as  having  at  birth.”  \nhttps://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cisgender (last visited July 25, 2022).  See also, \nGrimm, 972 F.3d at 594. \n \nPage 9 of 29 \n655995 \n\n \nviolation.”  Maldonado v. Fontanes, 568 F.3d 263, 269 (1st Cir. 2009) (citation omitted).  The \nCourt, in the exercise of its discretion, may address the prongs in either order.  See Hunt v. Massi, \n773 F.3d 361, 367 (1st Cir. 2014).   \n1.  The Facts Alleged in the Amended Complaint Do Not Make Out a Violation \nof Plaintiffs’ Substantive Due Process Rights. \n \nCounts I-III do not allege conduct that shocks the conscience or that deprives plaintiffs of \na protected parental interest.  “As distinguished from its procedural cousin . . . a substantive due \nprocess inquiry focuses on ‘what’ the government has done, as opposed to ‘how and when’ the \ngovernment did it.”  Mongeau v. City of Marlborough, 492 F.3d 14, 18 (1st Cir. 2007), quoting, \nAmsden v. Moran, 904 F.2d 748, 754 (1st Cir. 1990) (internal quotation marks omitted).  It is \nbeyond dispute that “[w]here, as here, a plaintiff's substantive due process claims challenge the \nconstitutionality of certain executive acts, ‘the plaintiff must show both that the acts were so \negregious as to shock the conscience and that they deprived him of a protected interest in life, \nliberty, or property.’\"  Harron v. Town of Franklin, 660 F.3d 531, 536 (1st Cir. 2011) (emphasis \nin original), quoting Pagàn v. Calderón, 448 F.3d 16, 32 (1st Cir. 2006).  “Only after ‘show[ing] \na constitutionally significant level of culpability’ may a plaintiff ‘turn to establishing that a \nprotected right was offended.’”  Abdisamad v. City of Lewiston, 960 F.3d 56, 60 (1st Cir. 2020), \nquoting Martínez v. Cui, 608 F.3d 54, 65 (1st Cir. 2010).  See  also, Mongeau  v. City of \nMarlborough, 492 F.3d 14, 19 (1st Cir. 2007); DePoutot v. Raffaelly, 424 F.3d 112, 118 (1st Cir. \n2005) (“the question of whether the challenged conduct shocks the contemporary conscience is a \nthreshold matter that must be resolved before a constitutional right to be free from such conduct \ncan be recognized”).   \n \n \nPage 10 of 29 \n655995 \n\n \na.  Defendants’ Alleged Conduct Did Not Shock the Conscience. \n \nIt is settled that government action “shocks the conscience” only if it is “arbitrary and \ncapricious, runs counter to the concept of ordered liberty, or violates universal standards of \ndecency.”  See Cruz-Erazo v. Rivera-Montanez, 212 F.3d 617, 622 (1st Cir. 2000).  It is further \nsettled law that “mere violations of a state regulatory scheme are not the stuff of which substantive \ndue process claims are constituted.”  See Barrington Cove, Ltd. Partnership v. Rhode Island \nHousing & Mortgage Finance Corp., 246 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir. 2001), citing, Coyne v. City of \nSomerville, 972 F.2d 440, 444 (1st Cir. 1992).  As stated in Coyne, “it is bedrock law in this Circuit \n. . . that violations of state law - even where arbitrary, capricious, or undertaken in bad faith - do \nnot, without more, give rise to a denial of substantive due process under the U.S. Constitution.”  \nId.   Further, “‘negligence, without more, is simply insufficient to meet the conscience-shocking \nstandard.’”  Gonzalez-Fuentes v. Molina, 607 F.3d 864, 881 (1st Cir. 2010), quoting J.R. v. Gloria, \n593 F.3d 73, 80 (1st Cir. 2010).   \nA hallmark of successful challenges is an extreme lack of proportionality, as the \ntest is primarily concerned with \"violations of personal rights . . . so severe . . . so \ndisproportionate to the need presented, and . . . so inspired by malice or sadism \nrather than a merely careless or unwise excess of zeal that it amounted to a brutal \nand inhumane abuse of official power literally shocking to the conscience.\"  Moran \nv. Clarke, 296 F.3d 638, 647 (8th Cir. 2002) (en banc) (ellipses in original)). \n \nGonzalez-Fuentes, 607 F.3d at 881 (emphasis added). \n \nCases in which appellate courts have found substantive due process violations have \ninvolved “serious physical intrusions or sustained abuse” or the intentional “framing” of innocent \ncitizens.  See Cummings v. McIntire, 271 F.3d 341, 346 (1st Cir. 2001), and cases cited; DePoutot, \n424 F.3d at 119, and cases cited.  See also, e.g., Hootstein v. Amherst-Pelham Reg’l Sch. Comm., \n361 F. Supp. 3d 94, 112 (D. Mass. 2019) (defendant provided lead-contaminated water and falsely \ncertified that it was safe to drink); Heinrich ex rel. Heinrich v. Sweet, 62 F. Supp. 2d 282, 314 (D. \nPage 11 of 29 \n655995 \n\n \nMass. 1999) (medical experiments conducted under false pretenses); Doe ex rel. B.G. v. Bos. Pub. \nSch., 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 32705, *16 (D. Mass 2019) (school officials’ failure to report known \nsexual  assaults  despite  the  fact  that  elementary  school-aged  children  had  been  repeatedly \nassaulted); Doe v. D’Agostino, 367 F. Supp. 2d 157, 172 (D. Mass. 2005) (teacher exposed and \ntouched Plaintiff’s lower abdomen during unwanted ringworm examination, coerced the plaintiff \ninto kissing, hugging, and sitting on her lap, and rolled a lint brush over plaintiff’s chest).  \nHere,  in  contrast  to  the  foregoing,  plaintiffs  allege  that  defendants  implemented  a \n“Protocol” whereby “parents are not to be informed of their child’s transgender status and gender-\naffirming social transition . . . unless the child, of any age, consents.”  Amended Complaint at ¶ \n36.   \nPlaintiffs have waived any challenge the constitutionality of M.G.L. c. 76, § 5, which bars \ndiscrimination on the basis of gender identity in public schools.  See Dkt. No. 17.  M.G.L. c. 76, § \n5 provides, in part: \nNo person shall be excluded from or discriminated against in admission to a public \nschool of any town, or in obtaining the advantages, privileges and courses of study \nof such public school on account of race, color, sex, gender identity, religion, \nnational origin or sexual orientation. \nM.G.L. c. 76, § 5 (emphasis added).  It is impossible to comply with the statue without recognizing \nand respecting a student’s stated gender identity, at least where a school district recognizes the \ngender identities of cisgender students.  The statue does not create an exception where a parent \ndemands discriminatory treatment for their children.  Complying with M.G.L. c. 76, § 5 does not \nshock the conscience and, therefore, Counts I-III should be dismissed.  Cf. Irish v. Fowler, 979 \nF.3d 65, 74 (1st Cir. 2020), cert. denied, 142 S. Ct. 74 (2021) (“In evaluating whether the \ndefendant's actions shocked the conscience, we also consider whether the defendants violated state \nlaw or proper police procedures and training”).   \nPage 12 of 29 \n655995 \n\n \n  Defendants’ alleged conduct is also consistent with state law and proper pedagogical \nprocedures and training as established by 603 CMR 26.00. \n603  CMR  26.00  is  promulgated  to  insure  that  the  public  schools  of  the \nCommonwealth do not discriminate against students on the basis of race, color, sex, \ngender identity, religion, national origin or sexual orientation and that all students \nhave equal rights of access and equal enjoyment of the opportunities, advantages, \nprivileges and courses of study at such schools. 603 CMR 26.00 shall be liberally \nconstrued for these purposes. \n \n603 CMR 26.01.  603 CMR 26.03 prohibits discrimination on the basis of gender identity “in \naccessing the courses of study and other opportunities available through the school system of the \ncity or town in which [a student] resides.”  603 CMR 26.03.  \n603 CMR 26.07 requires schools to undertake “Active Efforts” to prevent discrimination.   \n(1)  The school committee of each school district shall establish policies and \nprocedures, and implement monitoring and evaluation practices that insure \nthat  all  obstacles  to  equal  access  to  school  programs  for  all  students \nregardless of . . .  gender identity . . .  are removed. Such policies shall \ninclude a requirement for an annual evaluation of all aspects of the K \nthrough 12 school program to insure that all students regardless of race, \ncolor, sex, gender identity, religion, national origin or sexual orientation are \ngiven an opportunity to participate in all programs offered by the school \nincluding athletics and other extra-curricular activities. \n \n(2)  All public schools shall strive to prevent harassment or discrimination based \nupon students’ race, color, sex, gender identity, religion, national origin or \nsexual orientation, and all public schools shall respond promptly to such \ndiscrimination or harassment when they have knowledge of its occurrence. \n \n603 CMR 26.07 (1), (2).  Like M.G.L. c. 76, § 5, 603 CMR 26.00 does not provide for parental \nnotice and the opportunity to opt out of its mandate.  In light of 603 CMR 26.00, defendants’ \nconduct does not shock the conscience.   \nFurther, contrary Amended Complaint’s inaccurate characterization of the Massachusetts \nDepartment of Elementary and Secondary Education’s (“DESE”) Guidance for Massachusetts \nPublic Schools Creating a Safe and Supportive School Environment (“DESE’s Guidance” or the \nPage 13 of 29 \n655995 \n\n \n“Guidance”), attached hereto  as Exhibit 1,3 defendants’ alleged conduct complied with the \nGuidance.  See Amended Complaint at ¶¶ 27-28 (quoting the Guidance).  Under the heading \n“Understanding Gender Identity,” the Guidance states: \nThe responsibility for determining a student's gender identity rests with the student \nor, in the case of young students not yet able to advocate for themselves, with the \nparent. One's gender identity is an innate, largely inflexible characteristic of each \nindividual's personality that is generally established by age four, although the age \nat which individuals come to understand and express their gender identity may vary \nbased on each person's social and familial social development.  As a result, the \nperson best situated to determine a student's gender identity is that student himself \nor herself. . . . \nConsistent with the statutory standard, a school should accept a student's assertion \nof his or her gender identity when there is \"consistent and uniform assertion of the \ngender-related identity, or any other evidence that the gender-related identity is \nsincerely held as part of a person's core identity.\" If a student's gender-related \nidentity, appearance, or behavior meets this standard, the only circumstance in \nwhich a school may question a student's asserted gender identity is where school \npersonnel have a credible basis for believing that the student's gender-related \nidentity is being asserted for some improper purpose. \nIn most situations, determining a student's gender identity is simple. A student who \nsays she is a girl and wishes to be regarded that way throughout the school day and \nthroughout every, or almost every, other area of her life, should be respected and \ntreated like a girl. So too with a student who says he is a boy and wishes to be \nregarded that way throughout the school day and throughout every, or almost every, \nother area of his life. Such a student should be respected and treated like a boy. \nExhibit 1 (footnote omitted).  As set forth above, the Guidance defines “young children” as those \n“not yet able to advocate for themselves.”  See Id.  When a child is able to advocate for themselves, \n“the person best situated to determine a student's gender identity is that student himself or herself.”  \nSee Id.  Here, as alleged, Foote and Silvestri’s children were able to advocate for themselves and \ndid so.  DESE’s Guidance states nothing more is required for a school to recognize and respect \ntheir gender identity.  See Id.   \n \n3 Also available at: https://www.doe.mass.edu/sfs/lgbtq/genderidentity.html (last visited July 29, \n2022).   \nPage 14 of 29 \n655995 \n\n \n  The Guidance suggests that: \nSome transgender and gender nonconforming students are not openly so at home \nfor reasons such as safety concerns or lack of acceptance. School personnel should \nspeak with the student first before discussing a student's gender nonconformity or \ntransgender status with the student's parent or guardian. For the same reasons, \nschool personnel should discuss with the student how the school should refer to the \nstudent, e.g., appropriate pronoun use, in written communication to the student's \nparent or guardian. \nExhibit 1.  Clearly, as set forth in the Guidance, the reason for speaking with a student before \ndiscussing their gender identity with parents is that they may not be openly transgender or gender \nnonconforming at home.  See Id.  The Guidance does not contemplate that a school will confer \nwith a student and then notify their parents of their gender identity against their wishes, as the \nAmended Complaint asserts.  See Id.  The Guidance also plainly suggests that a student may be \nreferred to by one set of pronouns in school and another set when communicating with parents.  \nSee Id.  Cf. Arroyo Gonzalez v. Rossello Nevares, 305 F. Supp. 3d 327, 333 (D.P.R. 2018) (“The \nCommonwealth's forced disclosure of plaintiffs' transgender status violates their constitutional \nright to decisional privacy”). \nFollowing the DESE Guidance does not shock the conscience.  Cf. Irish, 979 F.3d at 74.  \nNor does recognizing and respecting a student’s gender identity despite their parents’ contrary \npreferences.  There are no allegations that any defendant engaged in any conduct whatsoever \nconcerning Feliciano and Salmeron or their children.  The Amended Complaint does not allege \nconduct that shocks the conscience and, therefore Counts I-III fail to state a claim for plaintiffs’ \nsubstantive due process rights upon which relief can be granted. \nb.  Plaintiffs Have Not Been Deprived of a Protected Interest.   \n \nCounts I-III should be dismissed because the Fourteenth Amendment does not provide the \nparental right(s) asserted by plaintiffs.  The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment \nPage 15 of 29 \n655995 \n\n \n“specially protects those fundamental rights and liberties which are, objectively, deeply rooted in \nthis Nation's history and tradition.”  Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 U.S. 702, 703 (1997).  \n“Substantive due process analysis must begin with a careful description of the asserted right, for \nthe doctrine of judicial self-restraint requires us to exercise the utmost care whenever we are asked \nto break new ground in this field.”  Reno v. Flores, 507 U.S. 292, 302 (1993) (citations, alterations, \nand internal quotation marks omitted).  See also, Glucksberg, supra.  Here, the parental right(s) \nasserted by plaintiffs are the rights to notice of their children’s gender identity so that a parent may \ninsist that a public school, in violation of state and federal law, discriminate against their children \nby rejecting and/or ignoring their children’s assertion of their gender identity.  Such rights have \nnever been recognized and should not be recognized for the first time here.  One cannot “opt out” \nfrom having a transgender child.   \ni.  The Asserted Right(s) Cannot Co-Exist with M.G.L. c. 76, § 5. \nThe right(s) asserted by plaintiffs are completely at odds with the anti-discrimination \nmandate of M.G.L. c. 76, § 5 and its implementing regulations.  See M.G.L. c. 76, § 5 (emphasis \nadded); 603 CMR 26.00.  M.G.L. c. 76, § 5 does not provide any exceptions for parental preference \nand cannot be complied with where a student’s asserted gender identity is denied or ignored.  See \nId.; M.G.L. c. 4, § 7(59).  Plaintiffs have waived any challenge to the constitutionality of M.G.L. \nc. 76, § 5.  See Dkt. No. 17.  Since M.G.L. c. 76, § 5 bars the assertion of the right(s) claimed by \nplaintiffs, their substantive due process claims should fail.  Further, given that the statute is \nconstitutional, all of defendants’ alleged conduct that is required by it is barred as a basis for \nliability in this action.   \n \n \nPage 16 of 29 \n655995 \n\n \nii.  Substantive  Due  Process  Does  Not  Protect  the  Interest(s) \nAsserted Here.  \n \nThe Due Process Clause has never been interpreted to grant the parental right(s) asserted \nby plaintiffs in this case.  See Parker v. Hurley, 514 F.3d 87, 101-103 (1st Cir. 2008), cert. denied, \n555 U.S. 815.  There is no case that stands for the proposition that a parent is entitled to notice of \ntheir child’s gender so that they can control it (or attempt to do so).   \nThe holdings of the cases cited in the Amended Complaint make it clear that the Fourteenth \nAmendment’s protection of “the fundamental right of parents to make decisions concerning the \ncare, custody, and control of their children,” as currently recognized, is much more limited than \nplaintiffs would have it.  See Troxel v. Granville, 530 U.S. 57, 66 (2000) (plurality opinion).  The \nright  has  its  genesis  in  Meyer  v.  Nebraska, 262  U.S.  390  (1923),  and Pierce  v.  Society  of \nSisters, 268 U.S. 510, 535, (1925).  See Brown v. Hot, Sexy & Safer Prods., Inc., 68 F.3d 525, 533 \n(1st Cir. 1995); Parents for Priv. v. Barr, 949 F.3d 1210, 1229 n.14 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 141 S. \nCt. 894 (2020).   \nIn Meyer, the Supreme Court struck down a Nebraska law that forbade instruction in \nGerman and other foreign languages “in part because it arbitrarily interfered with the ‘right of \nparents’ to procure such instruction for their children.”  Brown, 68 F.3d at 533, citing Meyer, 262 \nU.S. at 400.  In Pierce, the Court held that a statute that made public school attendance compulsory, \nbarring secular and parochial private education, “unreasonably interfere[d] with the liberty of \nparents and guardians to direct the upbringing and education of children under their control.”  \nPierce, 268 U.S. 510, 534–535.  According to the First Circuit: \nThe Meyer and Pierce cases, we think, evince the principle that the state cannot \nprevent parents from choosing a specific educational program—whether it be \nreligious instruction at a private school or instruction in a foreign language. That is, \nthe  state  does  not  have  the  power  to  “standardize  its  children”  or  “foster  a \nhomogenous people” by completely foreclosing the opportunity of individuals and \nPage 17 of 29 \n655995 \n\n \ngroups to choose a different path of education. Meyer, 262 U.S. at 402, 43 S.Ct. at \n627–28, discussed in, Tribe, supra, § 15–6 at 1319. \n \nBrown, 68 F.3d at 533. \n \nIn Prince v. Massachusetts, 321 U.S. 158 (1944), the Supreme Court rejected a challenge \nto a Massachusetts statute that barred children from proselytizing in public through the sale of \nreligious literature.   \n[T]he family itself is not beyond regulation in the public interest, as against a claim \nof religious liberty. Reynolds v. United States, 98 U.S. 145, 25 L.Ed. 244; Davis v. \nBeason, 133 U.S. 333, 10 S.Ct. 299, 33 L.Ed. 637. And neither rights of religion \nnor rights of parenthood are beyond limitation. Acting to guard the general interest \nin youth's well being, the state as parens patriae may restrict the parent's control by \nrequiring school attendance, regulating or prohibiting the child's labor, and in many \nother ways. \n \nId. at 166 (1944) (footnotes omitted).   \n \nIn Moore v. City of E. Cleveland, Ohio, 431 U.S. 494 (1977), the Supreme Court struck \ndown an ordinance that made it a criminal offense for the appellant to share her home with her son \nand two grandsons.  See Id. at 495-496.  The Court held that the Fourteenth Amendment’s \nsubstantive due process clause “prevents East Cleveland from standardizing its children and its \nadults by forcing all to live in certain narrowly defined family patterns.”  Id. at 506.   \n  In Troxel v. Granville, 530 U.S. 57, 72–73 (2000), the Supreme Court held that, as applied, \na  Washington  nonparental  visitation  statute  violated  the  Fourteenth  Amendment.  \n“Troxel concerned a state government's interference with a mother's decision about the amount of \nvisitation with her daughters’ paternal grandparents that was in her daughters’ best interests; it did \nnot address the extent of parents’ rights to direct the policies of the public schools that their \nchildren attend.”  Parents for Priv., 949 F.3d at 1230.  See also, Parker, 514 F.3d at 101.  Troxel \ndoes not provide plaintiffs with the right(s) asserted here.   \nPage 18 of 29 \n655995 \n\n \nThe cases cited by the Amended Complaint for the proposition that parents have a \nFourteenth Amendment right to control their children’s health care, to the extent relevant, stand \nfor the proposition that parents do not have absolute rights when it comes to their children and that \nchildren, as well as adults, enjoy constitutional protections.  They do not establish the existence of \nthe rights asserted by plaintiffs.  J.R. v. Parham, 442 U.S. 584 (1979), dealt with the voluntary \ncommitment of children by their parents.   \nIn defining the respective rights and prerogatives of the child and parent in the \nvoluntary commitment setting, we conclude that our precedents permit the parents \nto retain a substantial, if not the dominant, role in the decision, absent a finding of \nneglect or abuse, and that the traditional presumption that the parents act in the best \ninterests of their child should apply. We also conclude, however, that the child's \nrights and the nature of the commitment decision are such that parents cannot \nalways have absolute and unreviewable discretion to decide whether to have a child \ninstitutionalized. They, of course, retain plenary authority to seek such care for their \nchildren, subject to a physician's independent examination and medical judgment. \n \nId. at 604.   \n  Similarly, in Custody of a Minor, 375 Mass. 733, 737 (1978), the Supreme Judicial Court \nheld that: \n[T]he question before the Superior Court was whether the State may intervene when \nparents decline to administer the only type of medical treatment which evidence \nbefore the court indicates could save their child's life. We affirm the judge's \nresolution of this issue. While recognizing that there exists a “private realm of \nfamily life which the state cannot enter,” Prince v. Massachusetts, 321 U.S. 158, \n166, 64 S.Ct. 438, 442, 88 L.Ed. 645 (1944), we think that family autonomy is not \nabsolute, and may be limited where, as here, “it appears that parental decisions will \njeopardize the health or safety of (their) child.” Wisconsin v. Yoder, 406 U.S. 205, \n234, 92 S.Ct. 1526, 1542, 32 L.Ed.2d 15 (1972). \n \nCustody of a Minor, 375 Mass. 733, 737 (1978).  \nNone of the foregoing decisions, which are cited within plaintiffs’ Amended Complaint, \nestablishes the right(s) asserted by plaintiffs.  The First Circuit has repeatedly rejected attempts to \ntransform the holdings of these cases into sweeping grants of parental rights.  See Parker, 514 F.3d \nPage 19 of 29 \n655995 \n\n \nat 101-103 & n.15 (“Troxel is not so broad as plaintiffs assert”) (rejecting asserted right to prior \nnotice and the opportunity for exemption from young children’s exposure to books containing \npositive portrayals of gay marriage); Brown, 68 F.3d at 534 (“the rights of parents as described \nby Meyer and Pierce do not encompass a broad-based right to restrict the flow of information in \nthe public schools).  See also, Parents for Priv., 949 F.3d at 1231 (rejecting claim that policy \nallowing transgender students to use bathrooms, locker rooms and showers corresponding to their \ngender identity violated the rights of parents of cisgender children).  The facts alleged in the \nAmended Complaint do not plausibly suggest that plaintiffs have been deprived of an interest \nprotected by the Fourteenth Amendment.   \niii.  The Parental Right(s) Asserted by Plaintiffs are Incompatible \nwith the Constitutional Rights of Students in Public Schools.   \n \n  The Amended Complaint asserts only parental  rights.  However, students also have \nconstitutional rights and plaintiffs cannot point to a single case where a parent’s rights have been \nheld to supplant a child’s rights under the circumstances as alleged.  Cf. Tinker v. Des Moines \nIndep. Comm. Sch. Dist., 393 U.S. 503, 506 (1969) (children do not “shed their constitutional \nrights to freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate”).  \nSpecifically in this context, the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and \nTitle IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a), protect transgender students \nfrom discrimination by public schools.  See Whitaker By Whitaker v. Kenosha Unified Sch. Dist. \nNo. 1 Bd. of Educ., 858 F.3d 1034, 1039, 1049, 1054 (7th Cir. 2017); Grimm v. Gloucester County \nSchool Board, 972 F.3d 586, 606-615, 616-619 (4th Cir. 2020), cert. denied 141 S. Ct. 2878 \n(school board’s refusal to allow a transgender male high school student to use boys’ bathrooms \nviolated his equal protection rights and his rights pursuant to Title IX).  Contrast, Doe by & through \nDoe v. Boyertown Area Sch. Dist., 897 F.3d 518, 521 (3d Cir. 2018), cert. denied, 139 S. Ct. 2636; \nPage 20 of 29 \n655995 \n\n \nParents for Priv. v. Barr, 949 F.3d 1210, 1230 (9th Cir. 2020), cert. denied, 141 S. Ct. 894 (2020).  \nCf. Bostock v. Clayton Cnty., Georgia, 140 S. Ct. 1731, 1737 (2020) (Title VII of the Civil Rights \nAct of 1964 prohibits employers from firing individuals for being homosexual or transgender).  \nPlaintiffs cannot point to any authority that stands for the proposition that parents have the right to \nnotice and the opportunity to waive their transgender children’s constitutional and statutory rights \nor that children’s rights are violated by a school district’s failure to honor such a parental right.   \n  While parents have the right to choose which schools their children attend, they do not \nhave the right to dictate whether or not a public school will recognize and respect their children’s \ngender identity.  Cf. Parker, 514 F.3d at 102.  Therefore, the adult plaintiffs’ claims fail.  “B.F.” \nand “G.F.s” claims fail because in the absence of a parental right to notice and the opportunity to \ndemand rejection of a child’s gender identity by a public school there can be no corresponding \nright on the part of a child, even assuming, without conceding, such corresponding rights exist.  \nThe facts alleged by the plaintiffs do not make out a violation of a constitutional right and, \ntherefore, Counts I-III should be dismissed.   \n2.  Qualified Immunity Bars the Imposition of Liability Because the Rights \nAsserted by Plaintiffs Were Not Clearly Established.   \n \nIt is beyond dispute that “[a] government official sued under § 1983 is entitled to qualified \nimmunity unless the official violated a statutory or constitutional right that was clearly established \nat the time of the challenged conduct.”  Carroll v. Carman, 574 U.S. 13, 16 (2014) (per curiam).  \n“A clearly established right is one that is ‘sufficiently clear that every reasonable official would \nhave understood that what he is doing violates that right.’”  Mullenix v. Luna, 577 U.S. 7, 11 \n(2015), quoting Reichle v. Howards, 566 U.S. 658, 664 (2012) (emphasis added).  “[Q]ualified \nimmunity protects all but the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law.”  Id. at \n12 (citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted).   \nPage 21 of 29 \n655995 \n\n \nThe  First  Circuit  has  taught  that  “[t]he  second  prong  (whether  the  law  was  clearly \nestablished at the time of the incident) is itself divisible into two inquiries.  First, the plaintiff must \nidentify either controlling authority or a consensus of persuasive authority sufficient to put [an \nofficial] on notice that his conduct fell short of the constitutional norm.  Second, the plaintiff must \nshow that an objectively reasonable [official] would have known that his conduct violated the \nlaw.”  Conlogue v. Hamilton, 906 F.3d 150, 155 (1st Cir. 2018) (citations omitted) (emphasis \nadded). \nAs set forth above, the Amended Complaint does not, and plaintiffs cannot, identify either \ncontrolling precedent or a consensus of persuasive authority that would put defendants on notice \nthat their alleged conduct violated plaintiffs’ rights.  The Supreme Court has strongly emphasized \n“the longstanding principle that ‘clearly established law’ should not be defined ‘at a high level of \ngenerality.’”  White v. Pauly, 137 S. Ct. 548, 552 (2017), quoting Ashcroft v. al-Kidd, 563 U.S. \n731, 742 (2011).  See also, Kisela v. Hughes, 138 S. Ct. 1148, 1152-1153 (2018); Mullenix, 577 \nU.S. at 12.  “The dispositive question is ‘whether the violative nature of particular conduct is \nclearly established.’”  Mullenix, 577 U.S. at 12, quoting al-Kidd, 563 U.S. at 742 (emphasis in \noriginal).  “This inquiry must be undertaken in light of the specific context of the case, not as a \nbroad general proposition.”  Id. (citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted). See also, \nRivas-Villegas v. Cortesluna, 142 S. Ct. 4, 7–8 (2021) (“Although this Court's case law does not \nrequire a case directly on point for a right to be clearly established, existing precedent must have \nplaced the statutory or constitutional question beyond debate”) (citation and internal quotation \nmarks omitted).   \nIt is notable that, as of this writing, there are multiple cases pending around the country \nthat raise issues that are similar to the issues here.  See, e.g., Perez v. Broski, Case No. 3:22-cv-\nPage 22 of 29 \n655995 \n\n \n0083-TJC-JBT (M.D. Fla.) (motion to dismiss pending); Littlejohn v. Sch. Bd. Of Leon County, \nCase No. 4:21-cv-00415 (N.D. Fla.) (same);4 Ricard v. USD 475 Geary Cnty., KS Sc. Bd., Case \nNo. 5:22-cv-04015-HLT-GEB (D. Ks.) (same); Doe 1 v. Madison Metropolitan Sch. Dist., 976 \nN.W.2d 584 (2022).  See also, https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2022/07/18/gender-\ntransition-school-parent-notification/ (last visited July 26, 2022).  This is an emerging area of law, \nnot one where the rights asserted by the plaintiffs are clearly established.   \nSecond, plaintiffs cannot show that every reasonable official would have known that \ndefendants’  alleged  conduct  violated  the  constitution.    A  reasonable  defendant  would  not \nunderstand that complying with state and federal law would violate plaintiffs’ rights.  As set forth \nabove, defendants’ conduct was consistent with the Equal Protection Clause, Title IX, M.G.L. c. \n76, § 5, and 603 CMR 26.00.  A reasonable official could believe that a parent had no right to \nrequest or require that a school not recognize a child’s gender identity and that a parent had no right \nto prior notice of non-discrimination.  Similarly, as to the minor plaintiffs, a reasonable official \ncould conclude that respecting both a student’s assertion of gender identity and request for \nconfidentiality would not violate that student’s rights.  \nWhile the age of a child may have some bearing on the relevant analysis, no court has \nestablished a rule that establishes a parent’s asserted right trumps the rights of an eleven-year-old \nor twelve-year-old who asserts their gender identity.  Particularly given that gender identity has \nbeen found to be immutable and that it is usually established at an early age, a reasonable official \ncould understand themselves bound to accept a pre-teen’s assertion of their gender identity.  See \nGrimm, 972 F.3d at 612-613. \n \n4 Attorneys Broyles and McAlister, plaintiffs’ counsel here, also represent plaintiffs in the Perez \nand Littlejohn matters.   \nPage 23 of 29 \n655995 \n\n \nAdditionally, DESE is the licensing body for all of the individual defendants.  See M.G.L. \nc. 61, § 1B; M.G.L. c. 71, § 38G.  A reasonable administrator, guidance counsellor, or school \nlibrarian would not understand DESE’s Guidance to suggest conduct that would violate plaintiffs’ \nFourteenth Amendment rights.  Cf. Irish, 979 F.3d at 77 (when an officer violates police procedure \nit supports an argument that a reasonable officer would have known that the conduct violated the \nConstitution). \nIn light of the foregoing, a reasonable school official could conclude that accepting a \nstudent’s assertion of gender identity and complying a request to keep that gender identity \nconfidential from parents would not violate plaintiffs’ rights.  Therefore, Counts I-III should be \ndismissed as against the individual defendants. \nB.  The Doctrine of Qualified Immunity Precludes the Imposition of Liability as to \nCount IV. \n \nWithout waiving Feliciano and Salmeron’s lack of standing, Count IV, which asserts a free \nexercise of religion claim brought by Feliciano and Salmeron, fails to state a claim upon which \nrelief can be granted as against the individual defendants.  The Amended Complaint alleges: \n255. Defendants’ actions in excluding Plaintiffs Feliciano and Salmeron from \ndecision making regarding their children’s sexual and gender identity target the \nPlaintiffs’ beliefs regarding the created order, human nature, sexuality, gender, \nparental  authority, and  morality which constitute central components  of their \nsincerely held religious beliefs. \n \n256.  Defendants’  actions  have  caused  a  direct  and  immediate  conflict  with \nPlaintiffs’ religious beliefs by prohibiting them from being informed of mental \nhealth issues their children are or might be experiencing and by denying them the \nopportunity to seek counseling and guidance for their children in a manner that is \nconsistent with the beliefs sincerely held by their family instead of the government.5 \n \n257. Defendants’ actions are coercive in that they deliberately supplant Plaintiffs’ \nrole as advisors of the moral and religious development of their children so that \n \n5 It is not clear what this refers to.  As discussed above, gender conversion therapy is not available \nin Massachusetts for patients less than 18 years of age.  See M.G.L. c. 112, § 275.   \nPage 24 of 29 \n655995 \n\n \nthey are not able to direct their children’s mental health care, counseling, and beliefs \nregarding  sex  and  gender  identity  in  accordance  with  their  values  because \nDefendants have substituted and supplanted the state’s perspective on the issues of \nsex and gender identity for the perspective of Plaintiffs in violation of Plaintiffs’ \nfree exercise rights. \n \nAmended Complaint at 255-257 (emphasis added).   \n \n1.  The Facts Alleged in the Amended Complaint Do Not Make Out a Violation \nof Plaintiffs’ First Amendment Rights. \n \nPursuant to the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment the government may not: \n“(1) compel affirmation of religious beliefs; (2) punish the expression of religious doctrines it \nbelieves to be false; (3) impose special disabilities on the basis of religious views or religious \nstatus; or (4) lend its power to one side or the other in controversies over religious authorities or \ndogma.”  Parker v. Hurley, 514 F.3d 87, 103 (1st Cir. 2008).  See also, Perrier-Bilbo v. United \nStates, 954 F.3d 413, 428 (1st Cir. 2020), cert. denied, 141 S. Ct. 818 (2020); Freedom From \nReligion Found. v. Hanover Sch. Dist., 626 F.3d 1, 14 (1st Cir. 2010).  “The Free Exercise Clause, \nimportantly, is not a general protection of religion or religious belief. It has a more limited reach \nof protecting the free exercise of religion.”  Parker, 514 F.3d at 103 (emphasis in original).  “The \nFirst Amendment does not “’require the Government itself to behave in ways that the individual \nbelieves will further his or her spiritual development or that of his or her family.’”  Id., quoting \nBowen v. Roy, 476 U.S. 693, 699 (1986) (emphasis in original).  Rather, “[a] plaintiff alleging a \nFree Exercise violation must show that a government action has a coercive effect on her religious \npractice.”  Perrier-Bilbo, 954 F.3d at 429. \nFirst, as with plaintiffs’ other claims Count IV should be dismissed to the extent that it is \ninconsistent with plaintiffs’ waiver of any claim that M.G.L. c. 76, § 5 is unconstitutional.  For \nexample, Feliciano and Salmeron’s claim to notice and exemption from their children’s possible \nPage 25 of 29 \n655995 \n\n \n(but unpled) gender identities are incompatible with the statute and should be dismissed.  See \nM.G.L. c. 76, § 5.   \nSubstantively, Feliciano and Salmeron’s free exercise claim fails because the Amended \nComplaint does not allege facts from which it can be inferred that either the so-called “Protocol” \nor defendants’ alleged conduct has had a coercive effect on their religious practice.  See Perrier-\nBilbo, 954 F.3d at 429.  As discussed above, there are almost no facts pled in the amended \ncomplaint regarding the Feliciano/Salmeron children.  The Amended Complaint does not allege \nthat any defendant had any contact or communication with either Feliciano or Salmeron, or their \nchildren.  There are no facts from which it can be inferred that any defendant has supplanted \nFeliciano and Salmeron’s “role as advisors of the moral and religious development of their \nchildren.”  The Amended Complaint should be dismissed because it will not support a claim “that \nas a condition of attendance at the public schools, the defendants have forced plaintiffs—either the \nparents or the children—to violate their religious beliefs.”  Parker, 514 F.3d at 105.  There are also \nno facts from which it can be inferred that the Feliciano and Salmeron children have suffered \ncoercion in the form of “extreme indoctrination” even assuming, without conceding that such a \nclaim would be cognizable.  See Parker, 514 F.3d at 105.  Count IV fails to state a claim upon \nwhich relief can be granted and should be dismissed.   \n2.  Qualified Immunity Bars the Imposition of Liability Because the Rights \nAsserted by Plaintiffs Were Not Clearly Established.   \n \nPlaintiffs  cannot  point  to  “either  controlling  authority  or  a  consensus  of  persuasive \nauthority” that would have provided defendants with notice that their (unpled) conduct violated \nFeliciano and Salmeron’s rights.  See Conlogue, 906 F.3d at 155. There is no authority for the \nproposition that a parent’s First Amendment rights are violated by the adoption of a policy that is \nPage 26 of 29 \n655995 \n\n \ninconsistent with the parent’s religious beliefs.  To the contrary, the most closely analogous \nauthority provides that: \n[T]he mere fact that a child is exposed on occasion in public school to a concept \noffensive to a parent's religious belief does not inhibit the parent from instructing \nthe child differently. A parent whose ‘child is exposed to sensitive topics or \ninformation [at school] remains free to discuss these matters and to place them in \nthe family's moral or religious context, or to supplement the information with more \nappropriate materials.’”    \n \nParker, 514 F.3d at 105, quoting C.N. v. Ridgewood Bd. of Educ., 430 F.3d 159, 185 (3d Cir. \n2005).  See also, Freedom From Religion Found., 626 F.3d at 14. \nHere, a reasonable school official, guidance counselor, or librarian could conclude that \ndefendants’ conduct was consistent with the law because it did not: compel affirmation of a \nparticular religious belief; punish plaintiffs for the expression of their religious beliefs; impose a \nspecial disability on plaintiffs because of their religious beliefs; or take a position in a religious \ncontroversy.  See Parker, 514 F.3d at103.  Count IV should be dismissed as against the individual \ndefendants because they are protected by qualified immunity. \nC.  Plaintiffs’ Claims Should Be Dismissed as Against the Town of Ludlow and the \nLudlow School Committee.   \n \nIn an action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983, a municipality cannot be liable on a theory of \nrespondeat superior, but, rather, may only be liable upon allegations and proof of impermissible \npolicy, custom or practice.  Monell v. Dept. of Social Services, 436 U.S. 658, 690-695 (1978).  The \nMonell  Court  held  that  municipal  liability  under  §  1983  can  be  imposed  only  where  the \nmunicipality itself “causes” the alleged constitutional violation.  Monell, supra, 436 U.S. at 658, \n692.  See also, DiRico v. City of Quincy, 404 F.3d 464, 469, n.12 (1st Cir. 2005).  A plaintiff bears \nthe burden of demonstrating the existence of a policy or custom and a “direct causal link” between \nthat policy or custom and the alleged constitutional violation.  City of Canton v. Harris, 489 U.S. \nPage 27 of 29 \n655995 \n\n \n378, 385 (1989); Monell, 436 U.S. at 694; Santiago v. Fenton, 891 F.2d 373, 381-382 (1st Cir. \n1989).  “Official municipal policy includes, among other things, the acts of the municipality’s \npolicymaking officials.”  Saldivar v. Racine, 818 F.3d 14, 20 (1st Cir. 2016), quoting, Connick v. \nThompson, 563 U.S. 51, 61 (2011) (internal quotation marks omitted; alterations omitted).   \nPlaintiffs’ claims as against the Town of Ludlow should be dismissed because there is no \nunderlying constitutional violation committed by the individual defendants, as set forth above.  See \nKennedy v. Town of Billerica, 617 F.3d 520, 531-32 (1st Cir. 2010).  As alleged, the so-called \nProtocol did not cause a violation of plaintiffs’ rights.  Therefore, plaintiffs’ claims against the \nTown of Ludlow should be dismissed.   \nThe Ludlow School Committee is not a body “politic and corporate” and cannot sue or be \nsued.  Cf. Doe v. Town of Blandford, 402 Mass. 831, 834-835 (1988).  See also, M.G.L. c. 258, § \n1; Martins v. Town of Rockland, 66 Mass. App. Ct. 1118, 2006 WL 204268 at *1 n.2 (July 21, \n2006) (Rule 1:28 decision) (claim against municipal school committee “dismissed, as it is not \nsubject to suit as separate entity under G.L. c. 258, §§ 1 & 2”); Murphy v. Town of Natick, 516 F. \nSupp. 2d 153 (D. Mass. 2007); Curran v. City of Boston, 777 F. Supp. 116, 120 (D. Mass. 1991) \n(holding that the Boston Police Department was a “non-person” and, as such, “not a suitable \nentity”); Henschel v. Worcester Police Dept., 445 F.2d 624 (1st Cir. 1971).  The Town of Ludlow \nis the real party in interest here and plaintiffs’ separate claims against the Ludlow School \nCommittee should be dismissed.   \nCONCLUSION \n  For the foregoing reasons, defendants’ motion to dismiss should be allowed.   \n \n \nPage 28 of 29 \n655995 \n\n \nCERTIFICATE OF CONSULTATION PURSUANT TO LOCAL RULE 7.1 \n  Counsel for defendants and counsel for plaintiffs have conferred and have attempted in \ngood faith to resolve or narrow the issues that form the subject matter of the instant motion.   \nRespectfully submitted, \nTHE DEFENDANTS, \nLUDLOW SCHOOL COMMITTEE,  \nLISA NEMETH, TODD GAZDA,  \nSTACY MONETTE, MARIE-CLAIRE FOLEY \nAND JORDAN FUNKE \n \nBy:     /s/ Nancy Frankel Pelletier, Esq. \nNancy Frankel Pelletier, Esq., BBO #544402 \nnpelletier@robinsondonovan.com \n \nBy:     /s/ David S.
