    "summary": "<p>This case involves the practice of separating school bathrooms based on biological sex. On June 28, 2017, a transgender student, who identified as male, filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida. The student, a minor, sued the School Board and Superintendent of Schools of St. Johns County, Florida, as well as the principal of Allen D. Nease High School, under 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1983. Represented by Lambda Legal and private counsel, the student sought a declaratory judgment that his exclusion from the boys&rsquo; restroom by a policy put in place by the school board violated his rights under the Fourteenth Amendment&rsquo;s Equal Protection Clause and Title IX of the Civil Rights Act. He sought preliminary and permanent injunctive relief enjoining the school board from denying him equal access to the boys&rsquo; restroom, and nominal damages against the school board only for the violation of his rights under the Fourteenth Amendment and Title IX. The complaint was quickly amended on September 7, 2017, to also include compensatory damages.</p>\r\n<p>Shortly after the initial filing, the assigned Magistrate Judge Patricia D. Barksdale recused herself from the case for reasons unknown to the Clearinghouse, and on July 3, 2017, the case was reassigned to Magistrate Judge Joel B. Toomey.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On July 19, 2017, the student moved for a preliminary injunction. After a hearing, the court denied the motion, but the court&rsquo;s reasoning was unavailable in the docket. On August 1, 2017, the Superintendent of Schools and the Principal of Allen D. Nease High School moved to dismiss the complaint against them. They argued that &ldquo;[b]ecause Plaintiff has sued the School Board directly, the official capacity claims against the Superintendent and Principal are redundant and unnecessary and should be dismissed with prejudice.&rdquo; Shortly thereafter, the plaintiff moved to voluntarily dismiss his claims as to those two defendants only. On August 8, 2017, the court granted the plaintiff&rsquo;s motion, mooting the two defendants&rsquo; motion to dismiss.</p>\r\n<p>In September 2017, the case was referred to mediation and Terrance Edward Schmidt was appointed as mediator. A mediation hearing was held on November 29, 2017, but concluded with an impasse.</p>\r\n<p>On November 29, 2017, the plaintiff filed an unopposed motion for miscellaneous relief, specifically requesting the court take judicial notice of EEOC decisions holding discrimination based on transgender status was a form of sex discrimination.</p>\r\n<p>After a three-day bench trial held on December 11-13, 2017 and oral argument, on July 26, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida concluded that, since the plaintiff is regarded as a boy both medically and legally, the law requires that he be treated like any other boy. This includes using the boy&rsquo;s restroom instead of the girl&rsquo;s restroom or a gender-neutral single-stall restroom provided for transgender students. 318 F.Supp.3d 1293. The district court ruled in the plaintiff&rsquo;s favor on both counts: it enjoined the School Board from prohibiting the plaintiff&rsquo;s use of the boys&rsquo; bathrooms and granted the plaintiff $1,000 in compensatory damages. The School Board timely appealed the district court's order.</p>\r\n<p>Following oral argument, on August 10, 2020, a divided panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed the district court over a lone dissenter. 968 F.3d 1286. Although the court acknowledged the School Board&rsquo;s goal of protecting their student&rsquo;s privacy by maintaining separate bathrooms for boys and girls, found three constitutional concerns with the School Board&rsquo;s policy. First, by relying upon a student&rsquo;s enrollment documents to determine sex assigned at birth, the policy was administered arbitrarily with respect to transgender students. Second, the School Board&rsquo;s privacy concerns about the plaintiff&rsquo;s use of the boys&rsquo; bathroom were merely &ldquo;hypothesized,&rdquo; with no support in the factual record. Third, the School District&rsquo;s bathroom policy subjected the plaintiff to unfavorable treatment simply because he defied gender stereotypes as a transgender person.</p>\r\n<p>After the dissenting judge withheld the mandate, the panel majority sua sponte withdrew its initial opinion and issued a revised opinion on July 14, 2021, again affirming the district court over a revised dissent, but on grounds that were neither substantively discussed in the initial panel opinion nor substantively made by any party before the district court or the appellate court. 3 F.4th 1299. Indeed, the court of appeals first agreed that heightened scrutiny applied to the case, because Supreme Court and circuit precedent required this level of scrutiny in cases involving sex discrimination. It further stated that the School Board has not met its &ldquo;demanding&rdquo; constitutional burden by showing a substantial relationship between its policy for excluding transgender students from certain restrooms and student privacy.</p>\r\n<p>The School Board filed a petition for rehearing en banc. The Court of Appeals granted the School Board's petition and vacated the panel's revised opinion. 9 F.4th 1369. The U.S. Department of Justice, Civil Rights Division (DOJ) joined an amicus brief, along with 50 other organizations, in support of the plaintiff&rsquo;s claims.2021 WL 5630400.</p>\r\n<p>On rehearing en banc, in a 7-4 vote, the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals (Circuit Judge Barbara Lagoa) upheld the school's bathroom policy, ruling it did not violate the Equal Protection Clause or Title IX of the Civil Rights Act. 57 F.4th 791. The opinion also stated that the Supreme Court&rsquo;s decision in Bostock v. Clayton did not apply in the context of bathrooms. As reasoning, the court first stated that in Bostock, the Supreme Court expressly declined to address the issue of sex-separated bathrooms and locker rooms. The court further explained that the appeal at issue was about schools and children and that a school is unlike an adult workplace. Lastly, still referring to Bostock, the court declined to include gender identity in the definition of 'sex' under Title IX and stated that &ldquo;a policy can lawfully classify on the basis of biological sex without unlawfully discriminating on the basis of transgender status.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>On January 30, 2023, the Court of Appeals vacated the order withholding the mandate and entered its en banc decision as final judgment. As of March 27, 2023, the case remained open, but the plaintiff had not filed a petition for a writ of certiorari.</p>",

    "summary_short": "A transgender student, who identified as male, brought a § 1983 action against his county’s school board. The student claimed that his rights under the Equal Protection Clause and Title IX of the Civil Rights Act were violated by the school board’s bathroom policy, which prevented the student from using the boys' bathroom at the county high school. Following a bench trial, the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida entered judgment in favor of the student. The school board appealed. After a three-judge panel of the Eleventh Circuit affirmed the district court’s hearing, the defendants petitioned for rehearing en banc. Upon rehearing, the Court of Appeals reversed the district court, holding that the school bathroom policy did not violate the transgender student's equal protection rights, and that the school bathroom policy did not violate Title IX.",

Mr. Adams is transgender, meaning \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00739-TJC-JBT   Document 207   Filed 08/10/20   Page 2 of 78 PageID 11084\nCase: 18-13592     Date Filed: 08/07/2020     Page: 2 of 74 \n   \nwhen he was born, doctors assessed his sex and wrote “female” on his birth \ncertificate, but today Mr. Adams knows “with every fiber of [his] being” that he is \na boy.  While Mr. Adams attended Nease High School, school officials considered \nhim a boy in all respects but one: he was forbidden to use the boys’ restroom.  \nInstead, Mr. Adams had the option of using the multi-stall girls’ restrooms, which \nhe found profoundly “insult[ing].”  Or he could use a single-stall gender-neutral \nbathroom, which he found “isolati[ng],” “depress[ing],” “humiliating,” and \nburdensome.  After unsuccessful negotiations with the St. Johns County School \nDistrict over his bathroom use, Mr. Adams brought suit against the St. Johns \nCounty School Board (the “School Board”) through his next friend and mother, \nMs. Erica Adams Kasper.  He asserted violations of his rights under Title IX of the \nEducation Amendments Act of 1972 (“Title IX”), 20 U.S.C. § 1681 et seq., and the \nFourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.  After a bench trial, the District \nCourt granted him relief on both claims.   \n  This case calls upon us to decide whether the St. Johns County School \nDistrict’s policy barring Mr. Adams from the boys’ restroom squares with the \nConstitution’s guarantee of equal protection and Title IX’s prohibition of sex \ndiscrimination.  We conclude it does not.  We affirm the District Court’s decision \non both questions. \n \n2 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00739-TJC-JBT   Document 207   Filed 08/10/20   Page 3 of 78 PageID 11085\nCase: 18-13592     Date Filed: 08/07/2020     Page: 3 of 74 \n   \nI. \n  The District Court developed a thorough factual record after a three-day \nbench trial of Mr. Adams’s claims.  See Adams ex rel. Kasper v. Sch. Bd. of St. \nJohns Cty., 318 F. Supp. 3d 1293, 1298–1310 (M.D. Fla. 2018).  We recite those \nfacts here, as necessary. \nDrew Adams was born in 2000.  At birth, doctors examined Mr. Adams and \nrecorded his sex as female.  That female designation has vexed Mr. Adams \nthroughout his young life.  As Mr. Adams entered puberty, he suffered significant \nanxiety and depression about his developing body, and he sought the help of a \ntherapist and a psychiatrist.  In the eighth grade, after introspection and with the \nhelp of therapy, Mr. Adams came to realize he was transgender.  He revealed to his \nparents that he was a boy, not a girl.  Together, Mr. Adams and his family met with \nmental health professionals, who confirmed Adams was transgender.  In time, Mr. \nAdams’s psychiatrist diagnosed him with gender dysphoria, a condition of \n“debilitating distress and anxiety resulting from the incongruence between an \nindividual’s gender identity and birth-assigned sex.”  Mr. Adams’s “gender \nidentity”—his consistent, internal sense of gender—is male, but the sex assigned to \nhim at birth was female.   \nTo treat and alleviate Mr. Adams’s gender dysphoria, the psychiatrist \nrecommended Adams socially transition to living as a boy.  This included cutting \n3 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00739-TJC-JBT   Document 207   Filed 08/10/20   Page 4 of 78 PageID 11086\nCase: 18-13592     Date Filed: 08/07/2020     Page: 4 of 74 \n   \nhis long hair short, dressing in more masculine clothing, wearing a chest binder to \nflatten breast tissue, adopting the personal pronouns “he” and “him,” and using the \nmen’s restroom in public.  Mr. Adams embraced these changes.  Socially \ntransitioning to using the men’s restroom, Mr. Adams explained at trial, is “a \nstatement to everyone around me that I am a boy.  It’s confirming my identity and \nconfirming who I am, that I’m a boy.  And it means a lot to me to be able to \nexpress who I am with such a simple action because . . . I’m just like every other \nboy.”   \n  The psychiatrist also supported Mr. Adams’s request for medical treatment \nfor his gender dysphoria.  Mr. Adams began a birth control regimen to end his \nmenstrual cycle and met with social workers and endocrinologists to obtain a \nprescription for testosterone to masculinize his body.  About a year after his \ndiagnosis with gender dysphoria, Mr. Adams underwent a bilateral mastectomy to \nremove his breast tissue.  At the time of trial, Mr. Adams contemplated further \nsurgeries to alter his internal reproductive organs and external genitalia, but he \ncould not take those steps before reaching the age of 18.   \n  Alongside his social and medical transition, Mr. Adams amended his legal \ndocuments to reflect his male sex.  Following Florida agencies’ established \nprocedures for gender change, Mr. Adams updated the sex marker on his learner’s \ndriving permit (which became his driver’s license) and his original birth certificate.  \n4 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00739-TJC-JBT   Document 207   Filed 08/10/20   Page 5 of 78 PageID 11087\nCase: 18-13592     Date Filed: 08/07/2020     Page: 5 of 74 \n   \nBoth now read “male” or “M.”  At the time of trial, Mr. Adams had not yet \nchanged the sex listed on his U.S. passport but testified he could “very easily go \nget that changed” by presenting a letter from his physician stating he was being \nclinically treated for gender transition.1   \n  The transition process, according to Mr. Adams, took “the better part of a \nyear.”  At trial, he described steps in his medical and social transition as a \n“rigorous process” through which “medical providers, me, and my parents [agreed] \nthat this was the right course of action.”  Mr. Adams said transitioning led to “the \nhappiest moments of my life,” “finally figuring out who I was,” and being “able to \nlive with myself again.” 2  Mr. Adams’s course of treatment—gender transition—\nalso reflects the “accepted standard of care for transgender persons suffering from \ngender dysphoria.”  Modern medical consensus establishes that “forc[ing] \n \n1 See Change of Sex Marker, U.S. DEP’T OF STATE, \nhttps://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/need-passport/change-of-sex-marker.html (last \nvisited August 7, 2020). \n \n  2 The dissenting opinion’s central flaw is that it does not meaningfully reckon with what \nit means for Mr. Adams to be a transgender boy.  The dissent describes Mr. Adams as “a \nfemale.”  See Dissenting Op. at 47 (calling Mr. Adams “a female who identifies as a male”).  \nThe dissent fails to acknowledge Mr. Adams’s gender transition, his gender dysphoria and \nclinical treatment, or the unique significance of his restroom use to his wellbeing.  The dissent \nalso ignores the finding of the District Court that, in light of Mr. Adams’s social, medical, and \nlegal gender transition, he is “like any other boy.”  Adams, 318 F. Supp. 3d at 1296–97 \n(resolving the parties’ dispute “over whether Drew Adams is a boy”).   \n  Because the dissent does not consider Mr. Adams’s transgender status analytically \nrelevant, it expresses the view that allowing Mr. Adams to use the boys’ restroom erodes \nrestroom divisions for all. This argument cannot stand together with the fact, found by the \nDistrict Court, that Mr. Adams is “like any other boy.”   \n5 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00739-TJC-JBT   Document 207   Filed 08/10/20   Page 6 of 78 PageID 11088\nCase: 18-13592     Date Filed: 08/07/2020     Page: 6 of 74 \n   \ntransgender people to live in accordance with the sex assigned to them at birth” is \nineffective and “cause[s] significant harm.”  In particular, the Pediatric Endocrine \nSociety maintains that “not allowing [transgender] students to use the restroom \nmatching their gender identity promotes further discrimination and segregation of a \ngroup that already faces discrimination and safety concerns.”   \nMr. Adams entered Nease High School in ninth grade, after he began \ntransitioning and presenting as a boy.  Mr. Adams’s mother informed the school \nthat Adams was transgender, currently transitioning, and should be considered a \nboy student, but did not discuss Adams’s bathroom use with the school.  For his \nfirst six weeks as a ninth grader, Mr. Adams used the boys’ restroom.  One day, \nhowever, the school pulled Mr. Adams from class and told him he could no longer \nuse the boys’ restroom because students had complained.  These complaints came \nfrom two unidentified girl students who saw Mr. Adams entering the boys’ \nrestroom.  There were no complaints from boy students who shared bathroom \nfacilities with Adams.  Regardless, school officials gave Mr. Adams two choices: \nuse a single-stall, gender-neutral bathroom in the school office, or use the girls’ \nfacilities.   \n  In issuing this warning to Mr. Adams, Nease High administrators were \nacting to enforce the St. Johns County School District’s (the “School District”) \nunwritten bathroom policy.  For “as long as anybody can remember,” the School \n6 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00739-TJC-JBT   Document 207   Filed 08/10/20   Page 7 of 78 PageID 11089\nCase: 18-13592     Date Filed: 08/07/2020     Page: 7 of 74 \n   \nDistrict has maintained a policy that, for restroom use, “boys go to boys’ rooms, \n[and] girls go to girls’ rooms.”  The School District defines “boy” and “girl” based \non “biological sex,” separating “biological boys” from “biological girls.”  It \nadministers this policy based on the sex indicated on a student’s enrollment \ndocuments.  Because Mr. Adams enrolled in St. Johns County schools in the fourth \ngrade as “female,” the School District’s policy considered him a “biological girl” \nwho could not use the boys’ restroom, regardless of Mr. Adams’s updated legal \ndocuments or verified course of medical treatment.  Students who fail to abide by \nthe School District’s bathroom policy can be disciplined for violating the student \ncode of conduct.   \nSchool administrators were not wholly unprepared for Mr. Adams’s plea to \nuse the boys’ restroom as a transgender boy.  In 2012, the School District began to \nconsider how to best accommodate its lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and \nqueer (collectively, “LGBTQ”) students.  Through research and consultation, the \nSchool District developed guidelines it considered to be “best practices” for faculty \nand staff encountering emerging LGBTQ issues raised by students.  The School \nDistrict implemented this LGBTQ best-practices policy in September 2015, at the \nsame time Mr. Adams was directed to avoid the boys’ bathroom.   \nAmong other provisions, the best-practices policy instructed educators to use \nLGBTQ students’ preferred names and pronouns; prohibit discriminatory bullying \n7 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00739-TJC-JBT   Document 207   Filed 08/10/20   Page 8 of 78 PageID 11090\nCase: 18-13592     Date Filed: 08/07/2020     Page: 8 of 74 \n   \nor harassment; protect students’ private information; allow students to be “open \nabout their sexual orientation or transgender identity”; and permit students to \n“wear clothing in accordance with their consistently asserted gender identity.”  For \nbathroom use, the best-practices policy clarified: “Transgender students will be \ngiven access to a gender-neutral restroom and will not be required to use the \nrestroom corresponding to their biological sex.”3  The policy also stated the School \nDistrict’s belief that no law required schools to “allow a transgender student access \nto the restroom corresponding to their consistently asserted transgender identity.”   \nThrough researching the LGBTQ best-practices policy, the School District \nlearned that other school districts—in Florida and in other states—permitted \ntransgender students to use the restroom according to their gender identity.  But the \nSchool District declined to adopt such a policy, in part because it feared any \nstudent might be able to gain access to any bathroom facility by identifying or \npretending to identify as “gender-fluid.”4  The School District, however, had never \n \n3 Through the LGBTQ best-practices policy, the School District also set policy for \ntransgender students’ use of school locker rooms.  That policy provided: “Schools will provide a \ntransgender student with available accommodations that best meet[] the needs and privacy \nconcerns of all students.  Transgender students will not be forced to use the locker room \ncorresponding to their biological sex.”   \nMr. Adams did not bring a claim for access to the boys’ locker rooms at Nease High \nSchool.  This opinion therefore does not address whether the Fourteenth Amendment requires \nschools to allow transgender students access to locker rooms consistent with their gender \nidentity. \n \n4 “Gender-fluid” describes a person who “typically reject[s] notions of static categories of \ngender and embrace[s] a fluidity of gender identity.”  In other words, a person identifying as \ngender-fluid “may feel they are a girl some days and a boy on others, or a combination, or \n8 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00739-TJC-JBT   Document 207   Filed 08/10/20   Page 9 of 78 PageID 11091\nCase: 18-13592     Date Filed: 08/07/2020     Page: 9 of 74 \n   \nencountered or even heard of any gender-fluid students or pretenders seeking \naccess to all bathroom facilities.  The School Board also believed allowing \ntransgender students to use single-stall restrooms appropriately reconciled \naccommodations for transgender students with the privacy rights of non-\ntransgender students.   \n  Mr. Adams disagreed.  He felt “alienated and humiliated” every time he \n“walk[ed] past the boys’ restroom on his way to a gender-neutral bathroom, \nknowing every other boy is permitted to use it but him.”  Mr. Adams believed the \nbathroom policy sent “a message to other students who [saw Adams] use a ‘special \nbathroom’ that he is different.”  Throughout his freshman and sophomore years, he \nand his mother protested the School District’s birth-sex-based bathroom policy, \nwriting letters, meeting with school officials, and filing a complaint with the U.S. \nDepartment of Education’s Office of Civil Rights.   \n  Unsuccessful, Mr. Adams—through his mother, Ms. Kasper—sued the \nSchool Board in federal court in June 2017.  He alleged the School Board violated \n \npossibly feel that neither term describes them accurately.”  As the District Court observed, no \n“scientific or medical definition” of “gender-fluid” exists in the record, and other courts have \naccepted expert testimony that gender-fluid, unlike gender dysphoria, “is not a clinical term.”  \nSee Doe ex rel. Doe v. Boyertown Area Sch. Dist., 276 F. Supp. 3d 324, 365 (E.D. Pa. 2017), \naff’d, 890 F.3d 1124 (3d Cir. 2018), cert. denied, 138 S. Ct. 2636 (2019).  The School District \noffered no evidence of gender-fluid students or students pretending to be gender-fluid in St. \nJohns County schools.  See id. at 376 n.44 (observing a school district had “no evidence that any \nstudent” who requested special restroom access had “other gender identities” beyond boy or girl, \nsuch as “gender-fluid”).   \n9 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00739-TJC-JBT   Document 207   Filed 08/10/20   Page 10 of 78 PageID 11092\nCase: 18-13592     Date Filed: 08/07/2020     Page: 10 of 74 \n   \nhis right to equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment and his rights under \nTitle IX by barring him from the boys’ bathrooms at school.  He asked for \ninjunctive, declarative, and monetary relief.  Mr. Adams then moved for a \npreliminary injunction to enjoin the School Board from enforcing its bathroom \npolicy.  The Honorable Timothy J. Corrigan denied his motion for a preliminary \ninjunction on August 10, 2017, but set the case for a bench trial in December 2017, \non an expedited schedule.  Before trial, Judge Corrigan toured Nease High School \nwith both sides’ counsel to view the bathroom facilities.   \n  After a three-day trial, Judge Corrigan issued findings of fact and \nconclusions of law, holding that Mr. Adams was entitled to declaratory, injunctive, \nand monetary relief on his constitutional and Title IX claims.  The School Board \ntimely appealed.   \nII. \n  After a bench trial, we review de novo the District Court’s conclusions of \nlaw.  Tartell v. S. Fla. Sinus & Allergy Ctr., Inc., 790 F.3d 1253, 1257 (11th Cir. \n2015).  We accept the District Court’s findings of fact, absent clear error.

XIV, § 1.  When state actors draw distinctions using sex or \ngender, this constitutional mandate “call[s] for a heightened standard of review.”  \nSee City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Ctr., 473 U.S. 432, 440, 105 S. Ct. 3249, \n3254 (1985).  Because sex or gender “generally provide[] no sensible ground for \ndifferential treatment,” id., the Equal Protection Clause tolerates only “exceedingly \npersuasive” classifications based on sex or gender, United States v. Virginia \n(“VMI”), 518 U.S. 515, 534, 555, 116 S. Ct. 2264, 2276, 2286 (1996).  “A gender \nclassification fails unless it is substantially related to a sufficiently important \ngovernmental interest.”  Cleburne, 473 U.S. at 441, 105 S. Ct. at 3255.  “Ever since \nthe Supreme Court began to apply heightened scrutiny to sex-based classifications, \nits consistent purpose has been to eliminate discrimination on the basis of gender \nstereotypes.”  Glenn v. Brumby, 663 F.3d 1312, 1319 (11th Cir. 2011). \nA. \n  Mr. Adams and the School Board are in agreement that our Court is required \nto review the School District’s bathroom policy with heightened scrutiny.  \nAlthough this standard of review is not in dispute, we first review why heightened \nscrutiny is warranted in order to chart a course for our analysis.   \n11 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00739-TJC-JBT   Document 207   Filed 08/10/20   Page 12 of 78 PageID 11094\nCase: 18-13592     Date Filed: 08/07/2020     Page: 12 of 74 \n   \n  The School Board concedes its policy broadly “discriminates on the basis of \nsex” by requiring “biological females to use girls’ bathrooms and biological males \nto use boys’ bathrooms.”  But Mr. Adams describes the discrimination more \nnarrowly.  He believes the bathroom policy discriminates against him because, by \nbeing transgender, he defies gender norms and stereotypes.  He explains that by \ndefining “boy” and “girl” based on “biological sex,” or sex assigned at birth, the \nSchool Board divides restrooms based on a characteristic that “punishes \ntransgender students and favors non-transgender students.”  He further points out \nthat the policy forces transgender students (and only transgender students) to \nchoose between using a single-stall restroom in isolation from their peers or using \na restroom that does not match their gender identity and causes them humiliation \nand insult.  Mr. Adams says this choice is no choice at all, so the bathroom policy \nhas the effect of excluding him from all communal restrooms.   \n  It is Mr. Adams who properly tees up the constitutional issue in this case.  \nThe School Board’s bathroom policy singles out transgender students for \ndifferential treatment because they are transgender: “Transgender students will be \ngiven access to a gender-neutral restroom and will not be required to use the \nrestroom corresponding to their biological sex.”  The policy emphasized the \nSchool Board’s position that no law required it to “allow a transgender student \naccess to the restroom corresponding to their consistently asserted []gender \n12 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00739-TJC-JBT   Document 207   Filed 08/10/20   Page 13 of 78 PageID 11095\nCase: 18-13592     Date Filed: 08/07/2020     Page: 13 of 74 \n   \nidentity.”  In this way, the policy places a special burden on transgender students \nbecause their gender identity does not match their sex assigned at birth.  And, as \nthis Court announced in Glenn, “discrimination against a transgender individual \nbecause of [his or] her gender-nonconformity is sex discrimination, whether it’s \ndescribed as being on the basis of sex or gender.”5  663 F.3d at 1317; cf. Bostock \nv. Clayton County, 590 U.S. ___, 140 S. Ct. 1731, 1741 (2020) (confirming that “it \nis impossible to discriminate against a person for being . . . transgender without \ndiscriminating against that individual based on sex”).  We therefore apply \nheightened scrutiny to the School Board bathroom policy.  See Glenn, 663 F.3d at \n1320. \nB. \n  Next, we recognize an important government interest behind the School \nBoard’s bathroom policy.  Out of concern for students’ privacy, the School Board \nadopted a policy prohibiting Mr. Adams and other transgender students from using \nthe restrooms matching their gender identity.  We believe the School Board’s goal \nis a worthy one.  Protecting the bodily privacy of young students is undoubtedly an \nimportant government interest.  See Whitaker ex rel. Whitaker v. Kenosha Unified \nSch. Dist. No. 1 Bd. of Educ., 858 F.3d 1034, 1052 (7th Cir. 2017) (holding a \n \n  5 In its analysis of the equal protection claim, the dissenting opinion barely mentions this \nCourt’s decision in Glenn.  See Dissenting Op. at 57.  This is remarkable, because Glenn \nestablished the equal protection rights of transgender people in this circuit. \n13 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00739-TJC-JBT   Document 207   Filed 08/10/20   Page 14 of 78 PageID 11096\nCase: 18-13592     Date Filed: 08/07/2020     Page: 14 of 74 \n   \nschool district had “a legitimate interest in ensuring bathroom privacy rights are \nprotected”); cf. New Jersey v. T.L.O., 469 U.S. 325, 338–39, 105 S. Ct. 733, 740–\n41 (1985) (observing, in the Fourth Amendment context, that a “search of a child’s \nperson” at school “is undoubtedly a severe violation of subjective expectations of \nprivacy”); Beard v. Whitmore Lake Sch. Dist., 402 F.3d 598, 604 (6th Cir. 2005) \n(noting that “[s]tudents of course have a significant privacy interest in their \nunclothed bodies” against strip searches at school). \nC. \n  Beyond this, we assume the government may promote its interest in \nprotecting privacy by maintaining separate bathrooms for boys and girls or men \nand women.  Mr. Adams, for his part, does not question the ubiquitous societal \npractice of separate bathrooms for men and women.  Instead, Mr. Adams argues \nthe School Board’s bathroom policy singles him out for differential treatment on \nthe basis of his gender nonconformity and without furthering student privacy \nwhatsoever.  The record before us has persuaded us to his view. \n  The School Board has demonstrated no substantial relationship between \nexcluding Mr. Adams from the communal boys’ restrooms and protecting student \nprivacy.  We see three constitutional infirmities with the School District’s \nbathroom policy.  First, the policy is administered arbitrarily.  The policy relies \nupon a student’s enrollment documents to determine sex assigned at birth.  This \n14 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00739-TJC-JBT   Document 207   Filed 08/10/20   Page 15 of 78 PageID 11097\nCase: 18-13592     Date Filed: 08/07/2020     Page: 15 of 74 \n   \ntargets some transgender students for bathroom restrictions but not others.  Second, \nthe School Board’s privacy concerns about Mr. Adams’s use of the boys’ bathroom \nare merely “hypothesized,” with no support in the factual record.  See VMI, 518 \nU.S. at 533, 116 S. Ct. at 2275.  Third, the School District’s bathroom policy \nsubjects Mr. Adams to unfavorable treatment simply because he defies gender \nstereotypes as a transgender person. \n1.  \n  The record demonstrates that the School District’s bathroom policy is \nadministered arbitrarily.  This poses a constitutional problem.  To pass muster \nunder the Fourteenth Amendment, a governmental gender classification must “be \nreasonable, not arbitrary.”  Reed v. Reed, 404 U.S. 71, 76, 92 S. Ct. 251, 254 \n(1971) (quotation marks omitted).   \n  By way of example, the Supreme Court struck down an arbitrary gender-\nbased policy in Craig v. Boren, 429 U.S. 190, 97 S. Ct. 451 (1976).  See id. at 204, \n97 S. Ct. at 460.  Craig addressed an Oklahoma statute that outlawed the sale of \n3.2% beer to young men under the age of 21 and to young women under the age of \n18, purportedly as a means to promote traffic safety.  Id. at 191–92, 199, 97 S. Ct. \nat 454, 458.  Considering the constitutionality of the statute, the Court first cast \ndoubt on the statistical evidence that young men drink and drive more frequently \n15 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00739-TJC-JBT   Document 207   Filed 08/10/20   Page 16 of 78 PageID 11098\nCase: 18-13592     Date Filed: 08/07/2020     Page: 16 of 74 \n   \nthan young women.6  See id. at 200, 97 S. Ct. at 458.  The Court concluded that the \nstatistical evidence did not demonstrate that gender was a “legitimate accurate \nproxy for the regulation of drinking and driving.”  Id. at 202, 204, 97 S. Ct. at 459, \n460.  Then, even setting aside the problematic correlation of gender and drinking \nbehavior, the Court observed that the statute as written did not even prevent young \nmen from driving under the influence.  This was because the law “prohibits only \nthe selling of 3.2% beer to young males and not their drinking the beverage once \nacquired (even after purchase by their 18-20-year-old female companions).”  Id. at \n204, 97 S. Ct. at 460.  Thus, the Court decided that the statute violated the \nFourteenth Amendment because its terms did not achieve its statutory objective.  \nId.  Concurring separately, Justice Stewart observed that the statute’s terms \n“amount[ed] to total irrationality.”  Id. at 215, 97 S. Ct. at 466.   \n  The School District’s bathroom policy suffers from this type of defect.  We \nset aside for now that the policy treats transgender students differently than non-\ntransgender students.  The policy still runs afoul of the Fourteenth Amendment \n \n  6 The Craig Court cautioned that “proving broad sociological propositions by statistics is \na dubious business, and one that inevitably is in tension with the normative philosophy that \nunderlies the Equal Protection Clause.”  429 U.S. at 204, 97 S. Ct. at 460.  The dissent throws \nthis caution to the wind.  It would condone the School District’s bathroom policy because \ntransgender students in the School District are few and the policy is “99.96 percent accurate in \nseparating bathrooms.”  Dissenting Op. at 50, 59.  The dissent considers this result “near-\nperfect.”  Id. at 50.  But this case has come before our Court because Mr. Adams considers the \nbathroom policy to be nowhere near perfect.  Once again, the dissent does not grapple with Mr. \nAdams’s status as a transgender boy. \n16 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00739-TJC-JBT   Document 207   Filed 08/10/20   Page 17 of 78 PageID 11099\nCase: 18-13592     Date Filed: 08/07/2020     Page: 17 of 74 \n   \nbecause it does not even succeed in treating all transgender students alike.  Just as \nthe statute in Craig did not prevent young men from driving after drinking 3.2% \nbeer, the bathroom policy does not succeed in excluding every transgender student \nfrom the restroom matching his or her gender identity.  This arbitrary result \ndemonstrates the unconstitutionality of the bathroom policy. \n  As the District Court found, the School District determines a student’s sex \nassigned at birth for purposes of restroom use by looking to the forms the student \npresented at the time he enrolled in the District.  Even if a student later provides \nthe District with a birth certificate or driver’s license indicating a different sex, the \noriginal enrollment documents control.  The enrollment forms, however, say \nnothing about a student’s assigned sex at birth or transgender status.  They ask only \nwhether a student is male or female.  At trial, the School District admitted that if a \ntransgender student enrolled with documents matching his gender identity, he \nwould be permitted to use the restroom matching his gender identity.  At present, \nthe School Board acknowledges that this loophole in the policy means some of the \nDistrict’s transgender students may be using school restrooms that match their \ngender identity.  See Oral Arg. Recording at 12:05–12:43 (Dec. 5, 2019).  But a \ntransgender student like Mr. Adams, who transitions after enrolling in the School \nDistrict, would not be able to use the restroom matching his gender identity.  In \n17 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00739-TJC-JBT   Document 207   Filed 08/10/20   Page 18 of 78 PageID 11100\nCase: 18-13592     Date Filed: 08/07/2020     Page: 18 of 74 \n   \nthis way, the bathroom policy does not even apply to all transgender students \nequally.   \n  Thus, the School District’s criteria for determining a student’s bathroom use \ndo not achieve the School Board’s stated goal of restricting transgender students to \nthe restroom of their assigned sex at birth.  The designation of a student’s sex on \nhis school enrollment documents is not a “legitimate, accurate proxy” for his sex \nassigned at birth.  See Craig, 429 U.S. at 204, 97 S. Ct. at 460.  It is arbitrary that \nsome transgender students—like Mr. Adams—are restricted by the bathroom \npolicy, while others are beyond its reach.  Again, the Fourteenth Amendment \nrequires a substantial, accurate relationship between a gender-based policy and its \nstated purpose.  See Cleburne, 473 U.S. at 441, 105 S. Ct. at 3255; Craig, 429 U.S. \nat 198, 97 S. Ct. at 457.  Because the bathroom policy does not do what it was \ndesigned to do, the School Board cannot show the requisite substantial \nrelationship.  See Frontiero v. Richardson, 411 U.S. 677, 690–91, 93 S. Ct. 1764, \n1772 (1973) (plurality opinion) (rejecting a gender-based policy as arbitrary \nbecause the government did not show that the policy promoted “administrative \nconvenience” by actually saving any money or time (quotation marks omitted)). \n2. \nAnd there are broader constitutional concerns.  The School Board’s concerns \nabout transgender students endangering restroom privacy are not borne out by the \n18 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00739-TJC-JBT   Document 207   Filed 08/10/20   Page 19 of 78 PageID 11101\nCase: 18-13592     Date Filed: 08/07/2020     Page: 19 of 74 \n   \nrecord.  To satisfy the Fourteenth Amendment, the government’s justification for a \ngender classification “must be genuine, not hypothesized.”  VMI, 518 U.S. at 533, \n116 S. Ct. at 2275.  While a rational basis standard of review “permits a court to \nhypothesize interests that might support [governmental gender] distinctions, . . . \nheightened scrutiny limits the realm of justification to demonstrable reality.”  Tuan \nAnh Nguyen v. INS, 533 U.S. 53, 77, 121 S. Ct. 2053, 2068 (2001) (O’Connor, J., \ndissenting). \nWe must examine the trial record to see whether the government showed a \nnon-hypothesized justification for its gender classification.  For instance, in Glenn, \nan employer claimed he fired a transgender woman because “other women might \nobject to [her] restroom use.”  663 F.3d at 1321.  But the record showed that the \noffice building had “only single-occupancy restrooms,” and the employer testified \nhe believed lawsuits over restroom use were “unlikely.”  Id.  Because the record \nshowed that concerns about restroom use were unfounded, our Court held there \nwas not sufficient evidence that the employer “was actually motivated” by \nrestroom-related concerns.  Id.  As a result, the Glenn opinion said the employer’s \ndefense was a “hypothetical justification” that was “wholly irrelevant to the \nheightened scrutiny analysis.”  Id.   \nHere, the School Board’s concerns about privacy in the boys’ bathrooms are \nas hypothetical as those raised in Glenn.  After extensive evidence was presented at \n19 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00739-TJC-JBT   Document 207   Filed 08/10/20   Page 20 of 78 PageID 11102\nCase: 18-13592     Date Filed: 08/07/2020     Page: 20 of 74 \n   \ntrial, the District Court found that Mr. Adams’s presence in the boys’ bathroom \ndoes not jeopardize the privacy of his peers in any concrete sense.  When Mr. \nAdams uses the restroom, he “enters a stall, closes the door, relieves himself, \ncomes out of the stall, washes his hands, and leaves.”  The School Board received \nno reports of privacy breaches during the six weeks Mr. Adams actually used the \nboys’ restroom at Nease.  Indeed, the School Board could not produce any \n“complaints of untoward behavior involving a transgender student” in the \nrestroom.  Nor could the School Board point to any incidents across the country in \nwhich allowing transgender students to use the restroom according to their gender \nidentity compromised other students’ privacy.  The District Court found that “any \nstudent engaging in voyeurism in the bathroom would be engaging in misconduct \nwhich is [already] subject to discipline through the School District’s code of \nconduct,” such that the bathroom policy was not necessary to protect any new \nprivacy concerns.  The court also accepted expert evidence that transgender \nstudents like Mr. Adams “typically seek privacy and discr[eet]ness in restroom use \nand try to avoid exposing any parts of their genitalia that would reveal sex \ncharacteristics inconsistent with their gender identity.”  In fact, the School Board \nconceded at oral argument it was “fair” that some transgender students in the \nSchool District may already be using the bathroom consistent with their gender \nidentity, without anyone’s knowledge.  Oral Arg. Recording at 12:05–12:43.  From \n20 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00739-TJC-JBT   Document 207   Filed 08/10/20   Page 21 of 78 PageID 11103\nCase: 18-13592     Date Filed: 08/07/2020     Page: 21 of 74 \n   \nthe sum of these facts, we cannot say the School Board has met its burden to show \na genuine, non-hypothetical privacy justification for excluding Mr. Adams from \nthe boys’ bathroom.  See Whitaker, 858 F.3d at 1052–53. \nAccepting, as it must, the District Court’s finding that Mr. Adams has not \nharassed or peeped at other boys while using the boys’ restroom, the School Board \nargues Mr. Adams’s mere presence in the boys’ room constitutes a privacy \nviolation.  It asserts that “when Adams enters a boys’ bathroom and there is a \nbiological boy using the urinal, that biological boy’s privacy rights have been \nviolated.”  Again, this record simply does not support this assertion.  Absent such \nevidence, we “decline to recognize such an expansive [formulation of] privacy . . . \nthat would be violated by the presence of students who do not share the same birth \nsex.”  See Doe ex rel. Doe v. Boyertown Area Sch. Dist., 897 F.3d 518, 531 (3d \nCir. 2018) (holding that transgender students’ access to bathrooms matching \ngender identity did not violate non-transgender students’ constitutional privacy \nrights), cert. denied, 139 S. Ct. 2636 (2019); see also Parents for Privacy v. Barr, \n949 F.3d 1210, 1222 (9th Cir. 2020) (holding that there is no Fourteenth \nAmendment privacy right not to share school restrooms with transgender students \nwho were assigned a different sex at birth); Whitaker, 858 F.3d at 1052 (holding a \nschool could not show the “mere presence of a transgender student in the \nbathroom” infringed on other students’ privacy rights, without facts supporting \n21 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00739-TJC-JBT   Document 207   Filed 08/10/20   Page 22 of 78 PageID 11104\nCase: 18-13592     Date Filed: 08/07/2020     Page: 22 of 74 \n   \ntangible breaches of privacy).  Simply put, the School Board singled out Mr. \nAdams’s use of the restroom as problematic, without showing that Adams did, in \nfact, flout or compromise the privacy of other boys when he was in the boys’ \nrestroom.   \nThe School Board next argues its bathroom policy survives heightened \nscrutiny because excluding transgender students from the restroom matching their \ngender identity keeps private the “different physiological characteristics between \nthe two sexes.”  The Board likens the bathroom policy to the government policies \nupheld in Michael M. v. Superior Court of Sonoma County, 450 U.S. 464, 101 S. \nCt. 1200 (1981), and Tuan Anh Nguyen v. INS, 533 U.S. 53, 121 S. Ct. 2053.  We \nreject these comparisons as inapt.   \nMichael M. held that a statutory rape law criminalizing sex with underage \ngirls, but not boys, passed constitutional muster because its goal was to “prevent \nillegitimate teenage pregnancies.”  450 U.S. at 470, 101 S. Ct. at 1205 (plurality \nopinion).  The idea was that “young men and young women are not similarly \nsituated with respect to the problems and the risks of sexual intercourse,” so the \nlaw bore a substantial relationship to the government’s important interest in \nreducing teenage pregnancies.  Id. at 471–72, 101 S. Ct. at 1205.  Nguyen likewise \naddressed pregnancy and childbirth.  The Nguyen Court upheld a statute allowing \nunmarried U.S. citizen mothers who gave birth abroad to establish citizenship for \n22 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00739-TJC-JBT   Document 207   Filed 08/10/20   Page 23 of 78 PageID 11105\nCase: 18-13592     Date Filed: 08/07/2020     Page: 23 of 74 \n   \nthe child automatically, while unmarried citizen fathers of foreign-born children \nhad to offer proof of paternity.  See 533 U.S. at 60, 73, 121 S. Ct. at 2059, 2066.  \nBecause “[f]athers and mothers are not similarly situated with regard to the proof \nof biological parenthood,” the law withstood heightened scrutiny.  Id. at 63, 121 S. \nCt. at 2060. \nThe use of the restrooms by boys and girls in closed, locked bathroom stalls \nis legally distinct from the reproductive differences between sexes, as related to \npregnancy and childbirth.  The District Court here expressly found that the School \nDistrict’s bathroom policy did not turn on “something innately different” between \nhow boys and girls use the bathroom.  The District Court also made the finding \nthat no anatomical differences between the sexes were required to be on display in \nthe school restrooms.  And, “if the School District’s concern is that a child will be \nin the bathroom with another child who does not look anatomically the same,” \nother possible anatomical differences between students, such as the differences \nbetween pre-pubescent and post-pubescent students, might be just as concerning \nfrom a privacy standpoint.  See Whitaker, 858 F.3d at 1052–53.  But the School \nDistrict’s bathroom policy did not account for these factors.  According to the facts \nfound at trial, Mr. Adams’s anatomical differences from his non-transgender male \npeers are irrelevant to his use of the boys’ restroom. \n23 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00739-TJC-JBT   Document 207   Filed 08/10/20   Page 24 of 78 PageID 11106\nCase: 18-13592     Date Filed: 08/07/2020     Page: 24 of 74 \n   \nAnd again here, the School Board’s invocation of privacy for anatomical \ndifferences is internally inconsistent.  The School Board ignores that, in many \nways, Mr. Adams has changed the physiological manifestation of his gender.  Like \nmany transgender boys and men, Mr. Adams surgically eliminated his breast tissue \nand embarked on hormonal treatment that would “alter the appearance of the \ngenitals, suppress menstruation, and produce secondary sex characteristics such as \nincreased muscle mass, increased body hair on the face, chest, and abdomen, and a \ndeepening of the voice.”  Were Mr. Adams to use the school’s restroom for girls, \nas the School Board maintains he could, his masculine physiology would present \nmany of the same anatomical differences the School Board fears if non-transgender \nboys used the girls’ restroom.  The District Court observed the School Board’s \nposition that Mr. Adams was free to use the girls’ bathroom “seem[ed] \ndisingenuous” for these reasons.  And of course, because the School Board \nidentifies a student’s gender based on the paperwork he submitted when he first \nenrolled in the school district, Mr. Adams would have been considered a boy under \nthe policy if he had happened to enroll with his updated legal documents.  On this \nrecord, the School Board failed to raise genuine, non-hypothetical justifications for \nexcluding Mr. Adams from the boys’ restroom. \n24 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00739-TJC-JBT   Document 207   Filed 08/10/20   Page 25 of 78 PageID 11107\nCase: 18-13592     Date Filed: 08/07/2020     Page: 25 of 74 \n   \n3.  \nThe School Board’s bathroom policy also treats transgender students like \nMr. Adams differently because they fail to conform to gender stereotypes.  To \nsurvive heightened scrutiny, a sex classification “must not rely on overbroad \ngeneralizations about the different talents, capacities, or preferences of males and \nfemales.”  VMI, 518 U.S. at 533, 116 S. Ct. at 2275.  And “sex-based stereotypes \nare also insufficient to sustain a classification.”  Whitaker, 858 F.3d at 1051; see \nJ.E.B. v. Alabama ex rel. T.B., 511 U.S. 127, 138–40, 114 S. Ct. 1419, 1426–27 \n(1994) (holding the Equal Protection Clause prohibits peremptory challenges to \njurors based on gender stereotypes); Glenn, 663 F.3d at 1320 & n.9 \n(“[G]overnmental reliance on gender-based stereotypes is dispositive in . . . equal \nprotection analysis. . . .”).  \nGender stereotypes “presume that men and women’s appearance and \nbehavior will be determined by their sex.”  Glenn, 663 F.3d at 1320.  Mr. Adams is \nconsidered transgender “precisely because of the perception that his . . . behavior \ntransgresses gender stereotypes.”  See id. at 1316.  Because Mr. Adams was \nassigned a female sex at birth but identifies consistently and persistently as a boy \nand presents as masculine, he defies the stereotype that one’s gender identity and \nexpression should align with one’s birth sex.  See id. (noting that transgender \npersons’ “appearance, behavior, or other personal characteristics differ from \n25 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00739-TJC-JBT   Document 207   Filed 08/10/20   Page 26 of 78 PageID 11108\nCase: 18-13592     Date Filed: 08/07/2020     Page: 26 of 74 \n   \ntraditional norms” (quoting Taylor Flynn, Transforming the Debate: Why We \nNeed to Include Transgender Rights in the Struggles for Sex and Sexual \nOrientation Equality, 101 Colum. L. Rev. 392, 392 (2001))). \nThe School Board’s bathroom policy sought to enforce this gender \nstereotype.  The School District administered the policy using students’ enrollment \ndocuments as a proxy for their sex at birth.  The School Board says this was the \nbest way to protect all students’ privacy in school restrooms.  But this policy \npresumes every person deemed “male” at birth would act and identify as a “boy” \nand every person deemed “female” would act and identify as a “girl.”  Based on \nthese stereotypes, the School Board labeled Mr. Adams as a “girl” for purposes of \nhis bathroom use, based solely on his sex assigned at birth.  This label gives no \nregard to the fact that that Mr. Adams lives and presents as a boy and has been \ndeclared a boy by his family, the State of Florida, the federal government, and his \nmedical providers.  As far as the record shows, Mr. Adams was the only student in \nthe School District with a “male” birth certificate and driver’s license who was not \nallowed to use the boys’ restroom.  Nevertheless, the School Board’s bathroom \npolicy relegated Mr. Adams to single-stall, gender-neutral bathrooms and exposed \nhim to school discipline for using the restroom matching his gender identity.  \nThese hardships were imposed on Mr. Adams because he is transgender and did \nnot act or present as female, the sex he was assigned at birth. \n26 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00739-TJC-JBT   Document 207   Filed 08/10/20   Page 27 of 78 PageID 11109\nCase: 18-13592     Date Filed: 08/07/2020     Page: 27 of 74 \n   \n  The gender stereotypes the School Board imposed on Mr. Adams track the \nstereotypes this Court ruled unconstitutional in Glenn.  Vandiver Elizabeth Glenn, \na transgender woman, was fired because her employer perceived her as “a man \ndressed as a woman and made up as a woman.”  663 F.3d at 1314, 1320–21 \n(quotation marks omitted).  Ms. Glenn’s employer was “unsettl[ed] to think of \n[Glenn] dressed in women’s clothing with male sexual organs inside that clothing.”  \nId. at 1314 (quotation marks omitted).  This Court held the employer’s discomfort \nwith Ms. Glenn’s femininity combined with her private anatomy were proof of \nunconstitutional gender stereotyping.  See id. at 1320–21.  Based on the \nemployer’s comments, this Court concluded Ms. Glenn was fired because she was \ntransgender and thereby defied gender stereotypes.  See id. \nAs in Glenn, the School District’s bathroom policy labels Mr. Adams as a \n“girl” solely because of the gender assigned to him at birth based on his sexual \norgans.  The policy advances gender stereotypes by deeming Mr. Adams “truly” \nfemale, even though he produced legal and medical documentation showing he \nwas male.  See Grimm v. Gloucester Cty. Sch. Bd., 400 F. Supp. 3d 444, 457 (E.D. \nVa. 2019) (“In determining the physical characteristics that define male and female \nand the characteristics that are disregarded, the [School] Board has crafted a policy \nthat is based on stereotypes about gender.” (citing, inter alia, Glenn, 663 F.3d at \n1316)), appeal docketed, No. 19-1952 (4th Cir. Sept. 3, 2019).  And like Glenn, the \n27 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00739-TJC-JBT   Document 207   Filed 08/10/20   Page 28 of 78 PageID 11110\nCase: 18-13592     Date Filed: 08/07/2020     Page: 28 of 74 \n   \nbathroom policy singles out Mr. Adams for different treatment because he is \ntransgender.  It excludes him from the restroom matching his gender identity and \ngives him little choice but to use the restroom in isolation from his peers.  See \nWhitaker, 858 F.3d at 1045 (affirming a preliminary injunction because a school \ndistrict caused irreparable harm to a student “when it dismissed him to a separate \n[gender-neutral] bathroom” and “stigmatized [him], indicating that he was \n‘different’ because he was a transgender boy”).  Of course the School Board here \ntreated Mr. Adams with more respect than the employer in Glenn.  School officials \nused Adams’s male pronouns, permitted him to wear boys’ clothes to school, and \ndid not interfere with his decision to identify openly as transgender.  Nevertheless, \nthe Constitution does not tolerate any form of gender stereotyping on the basis of \none’s birth sex and sexual organs.  See Glenn, 663 F.3d at 1316–17. \nThe School Board repeats its concern that allowing Mr. Adams to use the \nboys’ restroom could allow “a non-transgender student to pose as a gender-fluid \nstudent to access the bathroom.”  But again, the Board offers no evidence that any \nstudents claiming to be gender-fluid have asked for access to all bathroom \nfacilities.  We remain unpersuaded that this concern is anything more than \nhypothetical.   \nThe School Board also believes allowing Mr. Adams access to the boys’ \nrestroom threatens the time-honored convention of separate bathrooms for men and \n28 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00739-TJC-JBT   Document 207   Filed 08/10/20   Page 29 of 78 PageID 11111\nCase: 18-13592     Date Filed: 08/07/2020     Page: 29 of 74 \n   \nwomen, because any person could “claim discrimination” and use a different \nbathroom for “no reason at all.”  Neither are we convinced by this argument.  Mr. \nAdams succeeds on his constitutional claim because, first, there is a dearth of \nevidence in this record that transgender students are a threat to other students’ \nprivacy.  Second, the record demonstrates that the School Board subjected Mr. \nAdams to gender stereotyping.  We emphasize that the constitutionality of gender-\nseparated bathrooms is not before us.  Although the dissenting opinion seems \nanxious to weigh in on this broader issue, no one has argued here that separating \nmen and women’s restrooms treats men and women unequally, lacks any factual \nbasis, or perpetuates “invidious, archaic, and overbroad stereotypes” about gender.  \nSee J.E.B., 511 U.S. at 130–31, 115 S. Ct. at 1422. \n4. \n  Because this record reveals no substantial relationship between privacy in St. \nJohns County School District restrooms and excluding Mr. Adams from the boys’ \nrestroom, the School District’s bathroom policy violates the Equal Protection \nClause.  In so holding, we join the Seventh Circuit, the only other circuit to \nencounter this issue, along with the majority of district courts who have taken up \nthis topic.  See Whitaker, 858 F.3d at 1054 (holding a transgender boy \ndemonstrated likelihood of success on the merits of his equal protection claim to \nuse the boys’ restroom); see also A.H. ex rel. Handling v. Minersville Area Sch. \n29 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00739-TJC-JBT   Document 207   Filed 08/10/20   Page 30 of 78 PageID 11112\nCase: 18-13592     Date Filed: 08/07/2020     Page: 30 of 74 \n   \nDist., 408 F. Supp. 3d 536, 578 (M.D. Pa. 2019) (granting summary judgment to \ntransgender girl on equal protection claim for access to girls’ restroom because \nschool district failed to demonstrate an exceedingly persuasive justification); \nGrimm, 400 F. Supp. 3d at 461 (same, for transgender boy); Evancho v. Pine-\nRichland Sch. Dist., 237 F. Supp. 3d 267, 293 (W.D. Pa. 2017) (holding \ntransgender students showed likelihood of success on equal protection claim to \naccess restrooms matching gender identity); Bd. of Educ. of the Highland Local \nSch. Dist. v. U.S. Dep’t of Educ., 208 F. Supp. 3d 850, 877 (S.D. Ohio 2016) \n(same, with transgender girl).   \nAlthough this issue is not before us here, we are aware that the Third and \nNinth Circuits have rejected claims from non-transgender students that their school \nviolated their fundamental right to privacy by separating boys’ and girls’ \nbathrooms based on gender identity. See Parents for Privacy, 949 F.3d at 1221–26 \n(affirming dismissal of non-transgender students’ constitutional privacy claim); \nDoe, 897 F.3d at 530–31 (holding that non-transgender students could not establish \nlikelihood of success on constitutional privacy claim).  And we subscribe to the \nthinking of the Third Circuit when it said that requiring “transgender student[s] to \nuse single-user facilities” under an assigned-sex-at-birth-based bathroom policy \n“would very publicly brand all transgender students with a scarlet ‘T,’ and they \n30 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00739-TJC-JBT   Document 207   Filed 08/10/20   Page 31 of 78 PageID 11113\nCase: 18-13592     Date Filed: 08/07/2020     Page: 31 of 74 \n   \nshould not have to endure that as the price of attending their public school.”  Doe, \n897 F.3d at 530.   \n  This record does not demonstrate that the School Board has met its \n“demanding” constitutional burden by showing a substantial relationship between \nexcluding transgender students from communal restrooms and student privacy.  \nSee VMI, 518 U.S. at 533, 116 S. Ct. at 2275.  We therefore affirm the District \nCourt’s grant of relief to Mr. Adams under the Fourteenth Amendment. \nIV. \n  Mr. Adams also prevails on his Title IX claim.  Title IX mandates that no \nperson “shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the \nbenefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or \nactivity receiving Federal financial assistance.”  20 U.S.C. § 1681(a).   \n  There is only one dispute about Mr. Adams’s Title IX claim: whether \nexcluding Mr. Adams from the boys’ bathroom amounts to sex discrimination in \nviolation of the statute.7  We conclude that this policy of exclusion constitutes \ndiscrimination.  First, Title IX protects students from discrimination based on their \ntransgender status.  And second, the School District treated Mr. Adams differently \nbecause he was transgender, and this different treatment caused him harm.  Finally, \n \n  7 The parties agree that the St. Johns County School District receives federal financial \nassistance and is thus bound by Title IX.  They agree as well that the use of the school restrooms \nis an “education program or activity” within the meaning of Title IX.   \n31 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00739-TJC-JBT   Document 207   Filed 08/10/20   Page 32 of 78 PageID 11114\nCase: 18-13592     Date Filed: 08/07/2020     Page: 32 of 74 \n   \nnothing in Title IX’s regulations or any administrative guidance on Title IX \nexcuses the School Board’s discriminatory policy. \nA. \n  Our analysis of Mr. Adams’s Title IX claim benefits from the Supreme \nCourt’s recent decision in Bostock v. Clayton County, 590 U.S. ___, 140 S. Ct. \n1731 (2020).  Bostock announced that Title VII’s prohibition on sex discrimination \nalso forbids discrimination based on transgender status.  Id. at 1737.  The Court \ninstructed that “it is impossible to discriminate against a person for being . . . \ntransgender without discriminating against that individual based on sex.”  Id. at \n1741.   \n  Bostock has great import for Mr. Adams’s Title IX claim.  Although Title \nVII and Title IX are separate substantive provisions of the Civil Rights Act of \n1964, both titles prohibit discrimination against individuals on the basis of sex.  42 \nU.S.C. § 2000e-2(a)(1) (Title VII); 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a) (Title IX).  Both titles also \nemploy a “but-for causation standard,” which Bostock found critical to its \nexpansive interpretation of sex discrimination.  See Bostock, 140 S. Ct. at 1739 \n(citing Univ. of Tex. Sw. Med. Ctr. v. Nassar, 570 U.S. 338, 350, 133 S. Ct. 2517, \n2527 (2013)); Comcast Corp. v. Nat’l Ass’n of African Am.-Owned Media, 589 \nU.S. ___, 140 S. Ct. 1009, 1014 (2020) (explaining that but-for causation is the \n“default” rule for federal antidiscrimination laws).  Given these similarities, it \n32 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00739-TJC-JBT   Document 207   Filed 08/10/20   Page 33 of 78 PageID 11115\nCase: 18-13592     Date Filed: 08/07/2020     Page: 33 of 74 \n   \ncomes as no surprise that the Supreme Court has “looked to its Title VII \ninterpretations of discrimination in illuminating Title IX” and its anti-\ndiscrimination provisions.  Olmstead v. L.C. ex rel. Zimring, 527 U.S. 581, 616 \nn.1, 119 S. Ct. 2176, 2195 n.1 (1999) (Thomas, J., dissenting); see, e.g., Franklin v. \nGwinnett Cty. Pub. Schs., 503 U.S. 60, 75, 112 S. Ct. 1028, 1037 (1992) (applying, \nin the context of a Title IX claim, Title VII’s conception of sexual harassment as \nsex discrimination). \n  The School Board argues that Title IX does not proscribe discrimination \nagainst transgender people, because the statute was only “intended to address \ndiscrimination plaguing biological women.”  Appellant’s Br. at 39.  However, \nBostock teaches that, even if Congress never contemplated that Title VII could \nforbid discrimination against transgender people, the “starkly broad terms” of the \nstatute require nothing less.  140 S. Ct. at 1753.  This reasoning applies with the \nsame force to Title IX’s equally broad prohibition on sex discrimination.   \n  Still, the School Board argues that Title IX’s ban on sex discrimination is \nsomehow different from Title VII’s because “schools are a wildly different \nenvironment than the workplace” and education “is the province of local \ngovernmental officials.”  Appellant’s Br. at 43–44.  We are not persuaded.  \nCongress saw fit to outlaw sex discrimination in federally funded schools, just as it \n33 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00739-TJC-JBT   Document 207   Filed 08/10/20   Page 34 of 78 PageID 11116\nCase: 18-13592     Date Filed: 08/07/2020     Page: 34 of 74 \n   \ndid in covered workplaces.  And, as we have explained, the Supreme Court’s \ninterpretation of discrimination based on sex applies in both settings. \n  With Bostock’s guidance, we conclude that Title IX, like Title VII, prohibits \ndiscrimination against a person because he is transgender, because this constitutes \ndiscrimination based on sex.   \nB. \n  Of course, Mr. Adams still bears the burden of showing that the School \nDistrict discriminated against him by barring him from the boys’ restroom because \nhe is transgender.  With the benefit of the District Court’s careful factfinding, we \nare satisfied that Mr. Adams succeeds on his claim of sex discrimination under \nTitle IX, and we affirm the District Court’s judgment in his favor.   \n  Again, Title IX provides that no person shall, “on the basis of sex . . . be \nsubjected to discrimination” at school.  20 U.S.C. § 1681(a).  Discrimination \n“refers to distinctions or differences in treatment that injure protected individuals.”  \nBurlington N. & Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. White, 548 U.S. 53, 59, 126 S. Ct. 2405, 2410 \n(2006); see also Jackson v. Birmingham Bd. of Ed., 544 U.S. 167, 174, 125 S. Ct. \n1497, 1504 (2005) (describing sex discrimination under Title IX as “differential” \nand “less favorable” treatment (quotation marks omitted)).  Title IX’s \nimplementing regulations explain that a school cannot “[s]ubject any person to \nseparate or different rules of behavior, sanctions, or other treatment” on the basis \n34 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00739-TJC-JBT   Document 207   Filed 08/10/20   Page 35 of 78 PageID 11117\nCase: 18-13592     Date Filed: 08/07/2020     Page: 35 of 74 \n   \nof sex.  34 C.F.R. § 106.31(b)(4).  Neither can a school “[p]rovide different aid, \nbenefits, or services or provide aid, benefits or services in a different manner” \nbecause of sex.  Id. § 106.31(b)(2). \n  As with his equal protection claim, Mr. Adams’s claim of sex discrimination \nis stated narrowly.  He argues the School District excluded him from the boys’ \nrestroom because he is transgender.  He says this policy constitutes discrimination \non the basis of sex in violation of Title IX.  Although one would never know it \nfrom reading the dissenting opinion, Mr. Adams does not argue that providing \nseparate restrooms for boys and girls violates Title IX.  Nor do we think he could.  \nThe statute’s implementing regulations specifically authorize “separate toilet, \nlocker room, and shower facilities on the basis of sex,” as long as all facilities are \n“comparable.”  34 C.F.R. § 106.33.   \n  The School Board argues Mr. Adams did not suffer any discrimination.  The \nBoard reads Bostock to hold that “a woman who identifies as a man—a \ntransgender man—is a woman.”  Appellant’s Suppl. Br. at 3.  This being the \nBoard’s view, it argues that Mr. Adams was treated just the same as all girl \nstudents at Nease High School.  But the School Board, like the dissenting opinion, \nmisapprehends Bostock.  Bostock explained that if an employer fires a transgender \nfemale employee but retains a non-transgender female employee, this differential \ntreatment is discrimination because of sex.  140 S. Ct. at 1741–42.  In the same \n35 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00739-TJC-JBT   Document 207   Filed 08/10/20   Page 36 of 78 PageID 11118\nCase: 18-13592     Date Filed: 08/07/2020     Page: 36 of 74 \n   \nway, Mr. Adams can show discrimination by comparing the School Board’s \ntreatment of him, as a transgender boy, to its treatment of non-transgender boys.   \n  The Board’s treatment of Mr. Adams is like that deemed discriminatory in \nBostock.  If Mr. Adams were a non-transgender boy, the School Board would \npermit him to use the boys’ restroom.  The School Board allowed all non-\ntransgender boys to use the boys’ restroom.  It allowed all non-transgender \nstudents with male driver’s licenses and birth certificates to use the boys’ restroom.  \nBut because Mr. Adams is a transgender boy, the School Board singled him out for \ndifferent treatment.  By the very terms of the bathroom policy, the Board refused to \nallow Adams, “a transgender student[,] access to the restroom corresponding to \n[his] consistently asserted transgender identity.”   \n  Mr. Adams was also treated differently than non-transgender students \ngenerally.  If Mr. Adams entered the restroom matching the sex on his legal \ndocuments and his gender identity, he faced school discipline.  But non-\ntransgender students did not face discipline for restroom use corresponding to their \ngender identity and their legal documents.  Through the bathroom policy, the \nSchool District ousted Mr. Adams from communal restrooms and gave him no \nchoice but to use the single-stall facilities.  In these respects, the Board subjected \nMr. Adams, “as a transgender student, to different rules, sanctions, and treatment \n36 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00739-TJC-JBT   Document 207   Filed 08/10/20   Page 37 of 78 PageID 11119\nCase: 18-13592     Date Filed: 08/07/2020     Page: 37 of 74 \n   \nthan non-transgender students, in violation of Title IX.”  Whitaker, 858 F.3d at \n1049–50; see 34 C.F.R. § 106.31(b)(4). \n  The record leaves no doubt that Mr. Adams suffered harm from this \ndifferential treatment.  Mr. Adams introduced expert testimony that many \ntransgender people experience the “debilitating distress and anxiety” of gender \ndysphoria, which is alleviated by using restrooms consistent with their gender \nidentity, among other measures.  318 F. Supp. 3d. at 1299 (quotation marks \nomitted).  Experts also testified that “forc[ing] transgender people to live in \naccordance with the sex assigned to them at birth . . . cause[s] significant harm.”  \nId. at 1300.  Mr. Adams described that he personally suffered “anxiety and \ndepression” from “walk[ing] past the boys’ restroom on his way to a gender-\nneutral bathroom, knowing every other boy is permitted to use it but him.”  Id. at \n1308.  The bathroom policy caused him to feel sorely “alienated” and “different” \nfrom other students because he is transgender.  Id.  Mr. Adams testified that, \nbecause of the policy, “I know that the school sees me as less of a person, less of a \nboy, certainly, than my peers.”  R. Doc. 160-1 at 204.   \n  Mr. Adams also suffered harm because he was separated from his peers in \nsingle-stall restroom facilities.  Mr. Adams explained it felt like a “walk of shame” \nwhen he had to walk past the communal restrooms for a single-stall, gender-neutral \nrestroom.  It heightened the stigma he felt for being transgender.  Mr. Adams had \n37 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00739-TJC-JBT   Document 207   Filed 08/10/20   Page 38 of 78 PageID 11120\nCase: 18-13592     Date Filed: 08/07/2020     Page: 38 of 74 \n   \nlittle choice in this matter.  The evidence at trial established that using the girls’ \nrestroom at school hindered Mr. Adams’s clinical treatment for gender dysphoria.  \nBecause of the bathroom policy, Mr. Adams had to use single-stall restrooms at \nschool.8  This marked him as different from his peers because he is transgender. \n  On the basis of this evidence, the District Court found that Mr. Adams \n“suffered emotional damage, stigmatization and shame from not being permitted to \nuse the boys’ restroom at school.”  Adams, 318 F. Supp. 3d at 1327.  These \nconsequences are well-recognized as injurious.  See Whitaker, 858 F.3d at 1045–\n47 (affirming a finding of irreparable harm because excluding a transgender \nstudent from the boys’ restroom “stigmatized” the student and caused him \n“significant psychological distress” including “depression and anxiety” (quotation \nmarks omitted)); Dodds v. U.S. Dep’t of Educ., 845 F.3d 217, 221–22 (6th Cir. \n2016) (per curiam) (affirming a finding of irreparable harm because excluding a \nyoung transgender student “from the girls’ restrooms has already had substantial \nand immediate adverse effects on [her] daily life[,] . . . health[,] and well-being”); \nsee also Obergefell v. Hodges, 576 U.S. ___, 135 S. Ct. 2584, 2602 (2015) \n \n  8 The evidence at trial also showed that the School District expected this outcome.  The \nSchool District official who developed the bathroom policy testified that she would prefer a \ntransgender student to use the gender-neutral single-stall facilities instead of the restroom of his \nsex assigned at birth.  This employee also acknowledged that a transgender student like Mr. \nAdams could face “safety, security, and privacy concerns” while using the restroom of his sex \nassigned at birth.   \n38 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00739-TJC-JBT   Document 207   Filed 08/10/20   Page 39 of 78 PageID 11121\nCase: 18-13592     Date Filed: 08/07/2020     Page: 39 of 74 \n   \n(recognizing that “laws excluding same-sex couples from the marriage right \nimpose stigma and injury”).  \n  Every court of appeals to consider bathroom policies like the School \nDistrict’s agrees that such policies violate Title IX.  The Seventh Circuit has held \nthat “[a] policy that requires an individual to use a bathroom that does not conform \nwith his or her gender identity punishes that individual for his or her gender non-\nconformance, which in turn violates Title IX.”  Whitaker, 858 F.3d at 1049.  The \nSixth Circuit, affirming a preliminary injunction order, stated that, under Title IX, \n“transgender students are entitled to access restrooms for their identified gender \nrather than their biological gender at birth.”  Dodds, 845 F.3d at 221.  We agree \nwith our sister circuits. \nC. \n  The School Board believes 34 C.F.R. § 106.33 of the Title IX implementing \nregulations forecloses Mr. Adams’s discrimination claim.  Section 106.33 reads:  \nA recipient may provide separate toilet, locker room, and \nshower facilities on the basis of sex, but such facilities \nprovided for students of one sex shall be comparable to \nsuch facilities provided for students of the other sex. \n \nThe School Board argues that the use of the term “sex” in this regulation clearly \nmeans “biological sex,” or sex assigned at birth.  Thus, it asserts that dividing \nrestrooms by sex assigned at birth—requiring transgender boys to use the girls’ \nrestroom and transgender girls to use the boys’ restroom—cannot be \n39 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00739-TJC-JBT   Document 207   Filed 08/10/20   Page 40 of 78 PageID 11122\nCase: 18-13592     Date Filed: 08/07/2020     Page: 40 of 74 \n   \ndiscriminatory under Title IX.  The Board considers Mr. Adams a “biological \nfemale,” and it seeks to exclude him from the boys’ restroom on this basis.   \n  But Mr. Adams’s discrimination claim does not contradict the implementing \nregulations for two reasons.  First, Mr. Adams is not challenging § 106.33’s \nprovision of separate restrooms for girls and boys.  He is simply seeking access to \nthe boys’ restroom as a transgender boy.  And second, the regulation does not \nmandate how to determine a transgender student’s “sex.”  Thus, we perceive no \nconflict between the text of § 106.33 and Mr. Adams’s successful claim of \ndiscrimination. \n  Title IX says nothing about Mr. Adams’s “sex.”  To start, Title IX and its \naccompanying regulations contain no definition of the term “sex.”  “Also absent \nfrom the statute is the term ‘biological.’”  Whitaker, 858 F.3d at 1047.  It seems \nfair to say that § 106.33 tells us that restrooms may be divided by male and female.  \nBut the plain language of the regulation sheds no light on whether Mr. Adams’s \n“sex” is female as assigned at his birth or whether his “sex” is male as it reads on \nhis driver’s license and his birth certificate.  While the School Board maintains that \nMr. Adams’s sex is female, the State of Florida recognizes his sex as male.  The \nfederal government is also prepared to recognize Mr. Adams’s sex as male, if he \nseeks an updated passport.  As the Supreme Court observed in Bostock, \ntransgender individuals have “one sex identified at birth and another today.”  140 \n40 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00739-TJC-JBT   Document 207   Filed 08/10/20   Page 41 of 78 PageID 11123\nCase: 18-13592     Date Filed: 08/07/2020     Page: 41 of 74 \n   \nS. Ct. at 1746.  Title IX and its regulations do not declare which sex should \ndetermine a transgender student’s restroom use.  Thus, the language of § 106.33 \ndoes not insulate the School Board from Mr. Adams’s discrimination claim based \non his transgender status. \n  The School Board argues that Bostock endorses its reading of the term “sex” \nas strictly “biological sex.”  According to the Board, Bostock laid out “a \nconception of sex founded in biology and not gender identity.”  Appellant’s Suppl. \nBr. at 4.   \n  Bostock lends no support to the Board’s interpretation of “sex.”  The \nBostock Court expressly declined to decide whether Title VII’s reference to “sex” \nmeans only “reproductive biology” or incorporates “some norms concerning \ngender identity.”  See 140 S. Ct. at 1739 (quotation marks omitted).  The Court felt \nit unnecessary to answer this open interpretive question in order to hold \ndiscrimination against transgender people unlawful.  Id.  Thus, its analysis \nproceeded “on the assumption that ‘sex’ signified what the employers suggest, \nreferring only to biological distinctions between male and female.”  Id.   \n  The District Court in this case studied the statute and the case law and held \nthat “the meaning of ‘sex’ in Title IX includes ‘gender identity.’”  Adams, 318 F. \n41 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00739-TJC-JBT   Document 207   Filed 08/10/20   Page 42 of 78 PageID 11124\nCase: 18-13592     Date Filed: 08/07/2020     Page: 42 of 74 \n   \nSupp. 3d at 1325.  If we thought it necessary, we would affirm this holding.9  But \nBostock counsels otherwise.  Our dissenting colleague accuses us of shirking our \nduty because we do not delve into the meaning of “sex” in Title IX.  To the \ncontrary, we follow the lead of the Supreme Court in Bostock, which found it \nunnecessary to perform that analysis as to Title VII.  We need not interpret the \nterm “sex” to recognize that Mr. Adams suffered discrimination at school because \nhe was transgender.  See Bostock, 140 S. Ct. at 1746.  And nothing in Bostock or \nthe language of § 106.33 justifies the School Board’s discrimination against Mr. \nAdams.  Specifically, § 106.33 does not dictate how schools should approach \ntransgender students’ restroom use or define a transgender student’s “sex.”  Indeed, \nno court of appeals has accepted the School Board’s arguments that § 106.33 \nrequires transgender students to use the restroom of their sex assigned at birth.  See \nParents for Privacy, 949 F.3d at 1227 (rejecting a strict “biological sex” reading of \n§ 106.33 as it applies to transgender students); Whitaker, 858 F.3d at 1047 \n(observing that the term “biological” does not appear in Title IX); G.G. ex rel. \n \n  9 Our dissenting colleague believes that the term “sex” cannot encompass any conception \nof gender identity.  See Dissenting Op. at 67–68.  Important to the dissent’s position is that, at \nthe time Title IX was passed, “a common belief among psychiatrists was that trans[gender] \npeople were severely mentally disturbed.”  Id. at 68 (alteration adopted and quotation marks \nomitted).  The Supreme Court has recently reminded us, however, that we must “apply[] \nprotective laws to groups that were politically unpopular at the time of the law’s passage.”  \nBostock, 140 S. Ct. at 1751.  To hinge our statutory analysis on the historical prejudice and \nmisunderstanding the dissent describes “would tilt the scales of justice in favor of the strong or \npopular.”  Id. \n42 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00739-TJC-JBT   Document 207   Filed 08/10/20   Page 43 of 78 PageID 11125\nCase: 18-13592     Date Filed: 08/07/2020     Page: 43 of 74 \n   \nGrimm v.

Ct. 1239 (2017).  \n  The School Board then argues that the Department of Education (“DOE”) \nand the Department of Justice (“DOJ”) endorse its reading of “sex” as “biological \nsex.”  In 2016, the DOE’s Office for Civil Rights and the DOJ’s Civil Rights \nDivision jointly issued a “Dear Colleague” letter instructing that discrimination \nbased on sex encompassed “discrimination based on a student’s gender identity, \nincluding discrimination based on a student’s transgender status.”  Then, in 2017, \nthe DOE and DOJ withdrew this guidance in a second “Dear Colleague” letter.  \nThe withdrawal letter reasoned that the 2016 guidance did not “contain extensive \nlegal analysis or explain how the position is consistent with the express language \nof Title IX, nor did [it] undergo any formal public process.”   \n  The School Board believes the withdrawal of the 2016 guidance signifies the \nDOE’s new position that sex discrimination does not include discrimination \nbecause of gender identity.  We are unpersuaded.  The 2017 letter contained no \nsubstantive interpretation of the meaning of “sex discrimination” in Title IX.  It \nmerely withdrew the 2016 guidance for lack of sufficient legal explanation and \nformal process.  Since the 2017 letter contains no substantive interpretation of Title \n43 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00739-TJC-JBT   Document 207   Filed 08/10/20   Page 44 of 78 PageID 11126\nCase: 18-13592     Date Filed: 08/07/2020     Page: 44 of 74 \n   \nIX or its regulations, we owe it no deference.  Cf. Kisor v. Wilkie, 588 U.S. ___, \n139 S. Ct. 2400, 2414 (2019) (explaining that deference is not warranted to an \nagency’s interpretation of its own regulation when that “interpretation does not \nreflect [the] agency’s authoritative, expertise-based, fair, or considered judgment” \n(alteration adopted) (quotation marks omitted)); Chevron, USA, Inc. v. Nat’l Res. \nDef. Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 842–44, 104 S. Ct. 2778, 2781–82 (1984) \n(describing deference to an agency’s interpretation of the statute which it \nadministers). \n  Even if we were to accept the School Board’s argument that sex is “founded \nin biology” or refers “only to biological distinctions between male and female,” see \nBostock, 140 S. Ct. at 1739, this interpretation does not establish that Mr. Adams is \nbiologically female and belongs in the girls’ restroom.  As the District Court found, \nMr. Adams—like some other transgender people—has confirmed his male sex not \njust legally and socially, but medically.  See 318 F. Supp. 3d at 1300–01.  We will \nnot rehash the details of Mr. Adams’s medical transition.  But suffice it to say that \nthe School Board’s preferred definition of “biological sex” reduces Mr. Adams “to \nnothing more than the sum of [his] external genitalia at birth,” to the exclusion of \nall other characteristics.  See Appellee’s Suppl. Br. at 11.  This understanding of \n“sex”—or, for that matter, “biological sex”—is as narrow as it is unworkable.  \n*  *  * \n44 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00739-TJC-JBT   Document 207   Filed 08/10/20   Page 45 of 78 PageID 11127\nCase: 18-13592     Date Filed: 08/07/2020     Page: 45 of 74 \n   \n  Bostock confirmed that workplace discrimination against transgender people \nis contrary to law.  Neither should this discrimination be tolerated in schools.  The \nSchool Board’s bathroom policy, as applied to Mr. Adams, singled him out for \ndifferent treatment because of his transgender status.  It caused him psychological \nand dignitary harm.  We affirm the District Court’s ruling that maintaining this \npolicy violated Title IX.10  \nV. \n  A public school may not punish its students for gender nonconformity.  \nNeither may a public school harm transgender students by establishing arbitrary, \nseparate rules for their restroom use.  The evidence at trial confirms that Mr. \nAdams suffered both these indignities.  The record developed in the District Court \nshows that the School Board failed to honor Mr. Adams’s rights under the \nFourteenth Amendment and Title IX.  The judgment of the District Court is \ntherefore AFFIRMED. \n \n  10 The School Board presents one last argument.  The Board points out that Title IX was \nenacted through Congress’s spending power, which permits recovery of damages only where \nrecipients of federal funding have notice of their liability.  See Davis ex rel. LaShonda D. v. \nMonroe Cty. Bd. of Educ., 526 U.S. 629, 640, 119 S. Ct. 1661, 1669–70 (1999).  The Board says \nit had no notice that Title IX forbids discrimination against transgender students.  Without such \nnotice, the Board contends, it cannot be said to have harbored discriminatory intent against Mr. \nAdams and it cannot be held liable.   \n  We need not pass upon the Board’s arguments, because the Board never raised the \nSpending Clause issue in the District Court.  “Arguments raised for the first time on appeal are \nnot properly before this Court.”  Hurley v. Moore, 233 F.3d 1295, 1297 (11th Cir. 2000) (per \ncuriam).  \n45 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00739-TJC-JBT   Document 207   Filed 08/10/20   Page 46 of 78 PageID 11128\nCase: 18-13592     Date Filed: 08/07/2020     Page: 46 of 74 \n   \nWILLIAM PRYOR, Chief Judge, dissenting: \nNot long ago, a suit challenging the lawfulness of separating bathrooms on \nthe basis of sex would have been unthinkable. This practice has long been the \ncommon-sense example of an acceptable classification on the basis of sex. And for \ngood reason: it protects well-established privacy interests in using the bathroom \naway from the opposite sex. Although the Supreme Court recently considered the \nrelationship between transgender status and sex in the context of claims of \nemployment discrimination under Title VII, it declined to consider the \npermissibility of sex-separated bathrooms. See Bostock v. Clayton Cty., 140 S. Ct. \n1731, 1753 (2020); see also id. at 1739 (assuming that “sex” refers “only to \nbiological distinctions between male and female”). After all, context matters. As \nthe late Justice Thurgood Marshall once put it, “A sign that says ‘men only’ looks \nvery different on a bathroom door than a courthouse door.” City of Cleburne v. \nCleburne Living Ctr., Inc., 473 U.S. 432, 468–69 (1985) (Marshall, J., concurring \nin the judgment in part and dissenting in part). \nAgainst this backdrop, the St. John’s County School Board has long \nenforced a policy that separates the bathrooms in its elementary and secondary \nschools by sex. And yet the majority rules this policy illegal—indeed \nunconstitutional—in an opinion that distorts the policy, misunderstands the legal \nclaims asserted, and rewrites well-established precedent. By failing to address \n  46   \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00739-TJC-JBT   Document 207   Filed 08/10/20   Page 47 of 78 PageID 11129\nCase: 18-13592     Date Filed: 08/07/2020     Page: 47 of 74 \n   \nhead-on the lawfulness of sex-separated bathrooms in schools, the majority recasts \nthe school policy as classifying students on the basis of transgender status. And \nbased on this recasting, it reaches the remarkable conclusion that schoolchildren \nhave no sex-specific privacy interests when using the bathroom. The majority \nopinion purports to allow only plaintiff Drew Adams, a female who identifies as a \nmale, to use the boys’ bathroom, but the logic of this decision would require all \nschoolchildren to use sex-neutral bathrooms. I dissent. \nA. The Bathroom Policy Does Not Violate the Equal Protection Clause. \nBecause the Equal Protection Clause “does not make sex a proscribed \nclassification,” a policy that classifies on the basis of sex is constitutional if it \nsurvives the two requirements of intermediate scrutiny. United States v. Virginia, \n518 U.S. 515, 533 (1996). The government first must prove that the “classification \nserves important governmental objectives.” Id. (internal quotation marks omitted). \nFor an objective to be “important,” it cannot stem from “overbroad generalizations \nabout the different talents, capacities, or preferences of males and females.” Id. \nThe objective must also be “genuine, not hypothesized or invented post hoc in \nresponse to litigation.” Id. In addition to proving that its policy serves important \nobjectives, the government must prove that “the discriminatory means employed \nare substantially related to the achievement of those objectives.” Id. (internal \nquotation marks omitted).  \n  47   \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00739-TJC-JBT   Document 207   Filed 08/10/20   Page 48 of 78 PageID 11130\nCase: 18-13592     Date Filed: 08/07/2020     Page: 48 of 74 \n   \nUnder this well-established standard, this appeal is not complicated. \nAlthough the school policy classifies on the basis of sex, it serves the important \nobjectives of protecting the interests of children in using the bathroom away from \nthe opposite sex and in shielding their bodies from exposure to the opposite sex. \nThe policy also fits tightly with both interests in privacy. By requiring students to \nuse the bathroom away from the opposite sex, the policy directly protects the first \ninterest and eliminates one of the most likely opportunities for a violation of the \nsecond interest. In short, it easily satisfies intermediate scrutiny, and even if \nquestions remained, the Supreme Court has long required that we defer to the \njudgment of public-school officials in this context. \nThe schools’ first objective—to protect students’ interest in using the \nbathroom away from the opposite sex—is important. As then-Professor Ruth Bader \nGinsburg explained, “Separate places to disrobe, sleep, [and] perform personal \nbodily functions are permitted, in some situations required, by regard for individual \nprivacy.” Ruth Bader Ginsburg, The Fear of the Equal Rights Amendment, Wash. \nPost, Apr. 7, 1975, at A21. Indeed, “[a]cross societies and throughout history, it \nhas been commonplace and universally accepted to separate public restrooms, \nlocker rooms, and shower facilities on the basis of biological sex in order to \naddress privacy and safety concerns arising from the biological differences \nbetween males and females.” G.G. ex rel. Grimm v. Gloucester Cty. Sch.

Ct. 1239 (2017). Separating bathrooms based on sex “dates \nback as far as written history will take us.” W. Burlette Carter, Sexism in the \n“Bathroom Debates,” 37 Yale L. & Pol’y Rev. 227, 287–88 (2018); see also id. at \n258–61 (documenting sex-separated bathrooms in feudal Japan and in ancient \nEgypt, Greece, and Rome). \nUnsurprisingly, the Supreme Court and our sister circuits have long \nacknowledged a privacy interest in using the bathroom away from the opposite sex. \nEven as it ordered the Virginia Military Institute to enroll women, the Supreme \nCourt acknowledged that “[a]dmitting women to VMI would undoubtedly require \nalterations necessary to afford members of each sex privacy from the other sex in \nliving arrangements.” Virginia, 518 U.S. at 550 n.19 (citing Brief for Petitioner at \n27–29 (arguing that integrating the institute would not require the sexes to be \ntogether “when sleeping, dressing and using the bathroom”)). Our sister circuits \nhave likewise accepted that “the law tolerates same-sex restrooms . . . to \naccommodate privacy needs.” Chaney v. Plainfield Healthcare Ctr., 612 F.3d 908, \n913 (7th Cir. 2010); accord Faulkner v. Jones, 10 F.3d 226, 232 (4th Cir. 1993); \nCumbey v. Meachum, 684 F.2d 712, 714 (10th Cir. 1982); see also, e.g., Women \nPrisoners of the D.C. Dep’t of Corr. v. District of Columbia, 93 F.3d 910, 926 \n(D.C. Cir. 1996) (“[S]egregation of inmates by sex is unquestionably \n  49   \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00739-TJC-JBT   Document 207   Filed 08/10/20   Page 50 of 78 PageID 11132\nCase: 18-13592     Date Filed: 08/07/2020     Page: 50 of 74 \n   \nconstitutional.”). This privacy interest has long been “appropriately harmonized” \nwith the principle of equality. Ginsburg, Equal Rights Amendment, supra.  \nThe schools’ policy is also “substantially related to the achievement” of its \nobjective to protect this privacy interest. Virginia, 518 U.S. at 533 (internal \nquotation marks omitted). Indeed, the policy is a mirror image of its objective—it \nprotects students from using the bathroom with the opposite sex by separating \nbathrooms on the basis of sex. The policy “is not a means to some greater end, but \nan end in itself.” Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc., 501 U.S. 560, 572 (1991) (plurality \nopinion). Intermediate scrutiny is satisfied when a policy directly achieves the \nobjective itself. See id.  \nThis conclusion does not turn on Adams’s sex. The district court found that \nthe St. John’s County School District educates about 40,000 children, and of all \nthose students, the Board is aware of only 16 transgender students. Even if the \ndistrict court were correct that gender identity, not biology, determines a person’s \nsex—that is, the school policy should have assigned these 16 students to the \nbathroom that aligned with their gender identity—the policy would still be 99.96 \npercent accurate in separating bathrooms by sex. This near-perfect result is \ncertainly enough to satisfy intermediate scrutiny, which does not “require[] that the \n[policy] under consideration must be capable of achieving its ultimate objective in \nevery instance.” Nguyen v. Immigration & Naturalization Serv., 533 U.S. 53, 70 \n  50   \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00739-TJC-JBT   Document 207   Filed 08/10/20   Page 51 of 78 PageID 11133\nCase: 18-13592     Date Filed: 08/07/2020     Page: 51 of 74 \n   \n(2001); see also Michael M. v. Super. Ct. of Sonoma Cty., 450 U.S. 464, 473 \n(1981) (plurality opinion) (“The relevant inquiry . . . is not whether the statute is \ndrawn as precisely as it might have been . . . .”). \nNor does it matter that Adams brings an as-applied challenge to the \nbathroom policy. “[C]lassifying a lawsuit as facial or as-applied . . . does not speak \nat all to the substantive rule of law necessary to establish a constitutional \nviolation.” Bucklew v. Precythe, 139 S. Ct. 1112, 1127 (2019). And, to reiterate, \nintermediate scrutiny does not “require[] that the [policy] under consideration must \nbe capable of achieving its ultimate objective in every instance.” Nguyen, 533 U.S. \nat 70. Demanding that the policy satisfy its privacy interests as to each plaintiff \nwho brings an as-applied challenge would disregard intermediate scrutiny by \ndemanding a perfect fit between the sex-based classification and the government \ninterest at issue. \nThe school policy also substantially advances its objective to protect \nchildren from exposing their unclothed bodies to the opposite sex. Courts have \nlong understood that the “special sense of privacy” that individuals hold in \navoiding bodily exposure is heightened “in the presence of people of the other \nsex.” Fortner v. Thomas, 983 F.2d 1024, 1030 (11th Cir. 1993) (internal quotation \nmarks omitted); accord, e.g., Cookish v. Powell, 945 F.2d 441, 446 (1st Cir. 1991); \nHarris v.

Waters, 641 F.2d 1375, 1387 (4th Cir. 1993); \nMoore v. Carwell, 168 F.3d 234, 236–37 (5th Cir. 1999); Brannum v. Overton Cty. \nSch. Bd., 516 F.3d 489, 494 (6th Cir. 2008); Canedy v.

Marriott, 70 F.3d 1144, 1146 (10th Cir. 1995). \nAnd separating bathrooms by sex eliminates one of the most common \nopportunities for exposure to the opposite sex. The district court acknowledged the \nundisputed testimony that students at Adams’s school change clothing outside \nbathroom stalls and that bathrooms are ordinarily unsupervised. By separating \nbathrooms by sex, the policy eliminates the risk of bodily exposure where it is \nmost likely to occur, which satisfies intermediate scrutiny. See Nguyen, 533 U.S. at \n70 (holding that a policy that “seeks to foster the opportunity” for a government \nobjective “has a close and substantial bearing on” that objective). \nEven if any doubt remained about whether the bathroom policy survives \nscrutiny, we must resolve that doubt in favor of the Board because the policy \ngoverns student conduct in public schools. The Supreme Court has long held that \nthe constitutional rights of students, including “Fourteenth Amendment rights, are \ndifferent in public schools than elsewhere.” Vernonia Sch. Dist. 47J v. Acton, 515 \nU.S. 646, 656 (1995). Schools have a “custodial and tutelary” power over minor \nstudents, “permitting a degree of supervision and control that could not be \n  52   \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00739-TJC-JBT   Document 207   Filed 08/10/20   Page 53 of 78 PageID 11135\nCase: 18-13592     Date Filed: 08/07/2020     Page: 53 of 74 \n   \nexercised over free adults.” Id. at 655. For that reason, the Supreme Court has long \ndeferred to the decisions of school districts in a variety of constitutional contexts, \nincluding when determining whether a suspicionless drug search was reasonable \nunder the Fourth Amendment, id. at 665, whether the censorship of certain speech \nwas acceptable under the First Amendment, Morse v. Frederick, 551 U.S. 393, \n403–06, 409–410 (2007) (collecting decisions), and whether corporal punishment \nwas cruel and unusual under the Eighth Amendment, Ingraham v. Wright, 430 U.S. \n651, 681–82 (1977). \nThe bathroom policy falls squarely within the Board’s authority to \n“prescribe and control conduct” in its schools. Id. at 682 (internal quotation marks \nomitted). “[I]n a public school environment . . . the State is responsible for \nmaintaining discipline, health, and safety.” Bd. of Educ. of Indep. Sch. Dist. No. 92 \nof Pottawatomie Cty. v. Earls, 536 U.S. 822, 830 (2002); see also Fla. Stat. \n§ 1001.42(8)(a) (making school boards responsible for the “control of students at \nschool, and for proper attention to health, safety, and other matters relating to the \nwelfare of students”). This responsibility is so weighty that school districts can be \nliable for sexual assault and harassment between students. See Miami-Dade Cty. \nSch. Bd. v. A.N., 905 So. 2d 203, 203–04, 206 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2005) \n(upholding a jury verdict against a school for failing to protect a student who was \nsexually assaulted in a bathroom by another student); see also Williams v. Bd. of \n  53   \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00739-TJC-JBT   Document 207   Filed 08/10/20   Page 54 of 78 PageID 11136\nCase: 18-13592     Date Filed: 08/07/2020     Page: 54 of 74 \n   \nRegents of Univ.

The Board’s assessment of the privacy risks its \nstudents face and the effectiveness of its policy in mitigating those risks deserves \ndeference. \nThe majority opinion elides this entire analysis by misunderstanding both \nthe classification and privacy interests at issue. It contends that the policy triggers \nheightened scrutiny not because it separates bathrooms by sex but because it \npurportedly imposes “differential treatment” on transgender students. Majority Op. \nat 12. In doing so, the majority misstates the school policy, conflates sex-based \nclassifications with transgender-based classifications, and contravenes Supreme \nCourt precedent. Compounding its errors, the majority then ignores fundamental \nunderstandings of why bathrooms are separated on the basis of sex by rejecting \nlong-standing privacy rationales for sex-separated bathrooms. This conclusion \nleads it to fault the objective underlying the school policy as both hypothetical and \nbased on impermissible stereotypes. After misconstruing both the classification \nand the privacy interests at issue—the only two ingredients of intermediate \nscrutiny—the majority opinion then concludes that the schools’ classification does \nnot substantially advance a valid objective. I take each of these errors in turn. \n  54   \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00739-TJC-JBT   Document 207   Filed 08/10/20   Page 55 of 78 PageID 11137\nCase: 18-13592     Date Filed: 08/07/2020     Page: 55 of 74 \n   \nThe majority’s conclusion that the school policy classifies on the basis of \nsex because it “singles out transgender students” is both central to its analysis and \nwrong. Id. The majority opinion reaches this incorrect conclusion by pointing to a \nprovision of the school policy that does not have that effect. The majority opinion \nsays the school policy targets transgender students because of the following \nprovision: “Transgender students will be given access to a gender-neutral restroom \nand will not be required to use the restroom corresponding to their biological sex.” \nId. But this provision only offers the option of using gender-neural bathrooms as \nan alternative to the bathroom that matches a child’s sex. It is an accommodation \nfor transgender students, not a special burden. What Adams actually challenges is \nthe requirement that students cannot use the bathrooms of the opposite sex, which \nlong predates the provision that accommodates transgender students. It is this \npolicy that “prohibit[s] . . . transgender students from using the restrooms matching \ntheir gender identity.” Id. at 14. Because this policy divides bathrooms by sex, not \ntransgender status, it does not facially classify on the basis of transgender status. \nThe decision of the Supreme Court in Geduldig v. Aiello, 417 U.S. 484 \n(1974), is instructive. There, the Court held that a state insurance policy that \nexcluded coverage for pregnancies did not classify on the basis of sex. Id. at 495–\n97. It explained that the classification at issue created two groups—pregnant and \nnonpregnant people. Id. at 496 n.20. Although “the first group is exclusively \n  55   \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00739-TJC-JBT   Document 207   Filed 08/10/20   Page 56 of 78 PageID 11138\nCase: 18-13592     Date Filed: 08/07/2020     Page: 56 of 74 \n   \nfemale,” the Court explained, “the second includes members of both sexes,” which \nrevealed a “lack of identity” between pregnancy and sex. Id.; see also Bray v. \nAlexandria Women’s Health Clinic, 506 U.S. 263, 271 (1993) (reaffirming this \nreasoning). This analysis applies with equal force here. The bathroom policy \ncreates two groups—students who can use the boys’ bathroom and students who \ncan use the girls’ bathroom. Both groups contain transgender students and non-\ntransgender students, so a “lack of identity” exists between the policy and \ntransgender status. Geduldig, 417 U.S. at 496 n.20. \nAt most, the policy has a disparate impact on transgender students, which is \nnot enough to create a sex-based classification. Facially neutral policies trigger \nintermediate scrutiny only if “invidious gender-based discrimination” motivated \nthem. Pers. Adm’r of Mass. v. Feeney, 442 U.S. 256, 274 (1979); see also Vill. of \nArlington Heights v. Metro. Hous. Dev. Corp., 429 U.S. 252, 265 (1977) (“Proof of \n. . . discriminatory intent or purpose is required to show a violation of the Equal \nProtection Clause.”). Adams cannot argue that a discriminatory purpose against \ntransgender students motivated the policy. Although the district court found that \nthe Board acted with discriminatory intent because it failed to update its policies \nwhen it became “aware of the need to treat transgender students the same as other \nstudents,” the Supreme Court has repeatedly held that “[d]iscriminatory purpose \n. . . implies more than . . . awareness of consequences.” E.g., Bray, 506 U.S. at 760 \n  56   \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00739-TJC-JBT   Document 207   Filed 08/10/20   Page 57 of 78 PageID 11139\nCase: 18-13592     Date Filed: 08/07/2020     Page: 57 of 74 \n   \n(internal quotation marks omitted); Feeney, 442 U.S. at 279 (internal quotation \nmarks omitted). It instead requires the Board to act “at least in part ‘because of,’ \nnot merely ‘in spite of,’ . . . adverse effects upon an identifiable group.” Feeney, \n442 U.S. at 279. The district court found that the “School Board did not have \ntransgender students in mind when it originally established separate multi-stall \nrestrooms for boys and girls,” which precludes a finding of discriminatory intent. \nThe decision of the Supreme Court in Bostock v. Clayton County, 140 S. Ct. \n1731, is not to the contrary. To be sure, Bostock clarified that “discrimination \nbased on homosexuality or transgender status necessarily entails discrimination \nbased on sex” in the context of employment discrimination under Title VII. Id. at \n1747; see also Glenn v. Brumby, 663 F.3d 1312, 1318 (11th Cir. 2011) (holding \nthat discrimination based on gender nonconformity constitutes sex discrimination \nregardless of whether the victim is transgender or not). But this appeal concerns \nthe converse question: whether discrimination on the basis of sex necessarily \nentails discrimination based on transgender status. Of course, a policy can classify \non the basis of sex without also classifying on the basis of transgender status. See, \ne.g., Nguyen, 533 U.S. at 60. Indeed, Bostock expressly disclaimed reaching any \nconclusion on the permissibility of sex-separated bathrooms and locker rooms. See \n140 S. Ct. at 1753. \n  57   \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00739-TJC-JBT   Document 207   Filed 08/10/20   Page 58 of 78 PageID 11140\nCase: 18-13592     Date Filed: 08/07/2020     Page: 58 of 74 \n   \nThe majority’s misunderstanding of the classification at issue infects its \nconstitutional inquiry. Intermediate scrutiny turns on the relationship between the \nclassification at issue and the government’s objectives—that is, whether a sex-\nbased classification is substantially related to the government’s objectives. See \nNguyen, 533 U.S. at 60. So the relevant question is whether excluding students of \none sex from the bathroom of the other sex substantially advances the schools’ \nprivacy objectives. The question is not, as the majority frames it, whether \nexcluding transgender students from the bathroom of their choice furthers \nimportant privacy objectives. The majority’s misunderstanding of the classification \nas based on transgender status gerrymanders its analysis to the second question. \nConsider the majority’s assertion that the bathroom policy cannot satisfy \nintermediate scrutiny because it is arbitrary. See, e.g., Craig v. Boren, 429 U.S. \n190, 201–04 (1976) (holding that a statute failed intermediate scrutiny when the \nrelationship between the sex-based classification and government interest was \n“unduly tenuous”). The district court found that the school district determines each \nchild’s sex by looking to the enrollment forms that the student provides when the \nstudent enrolls, which includes the student’s birth certificate. The majority explains \nthat a transgender student who changed the sex on his birth certificate before \nenrolling could use the bathroom matching his gender identity and not his sex. See \ngenerally Fla. Admin. Code Ann. r. 64V-1.003(2)(c), (4)(b) (allowing amendments \n  58   \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00739-TJC-JBT   Document 207   Filed 08/10/20   Page 59 of 78 PageID 11141\nCase: 18-13592     Date Filed: 08/07/2020     Page: 59 of 74 \n   \nto birth certificates with medical documentation). According to the majority, this \nprocess for determining sex fails to achieve the “stated goal of restricting \ntransgender students to the restroom of their assigned sex at birth” because the \nenrollment documents are not “legitimate, accurate prox[ies]” for determining a \ntransgender student’s “sex assigned at birth.” Majority Op. at 18 (quoting Craig, \n429 U.S. at 204). \nThis argument fails when we remember that the goal of the policy is to \nrestrict all students, not only transgender students, from the bathroom of the \nopposite sex. Birth certificates are an almost perfect proxy for determining a \nstudent’s sex. Even if all transgender students in the school district used bathrooms \nthat did not align with their sex, the policy would still be 99.96 percent accurate in \nseparating bathrooms by sex, which satisfies intermediate scrutiny. See Nguyen, \n533 U.S. at 70. To close the supposed loophole that the majority identifies, schools \nin the district would need to target transgender students. Of course, intermediate \nscrutiny does not require that approach. See id. at 63 (“The Constitution . . . does \nnot require that Congress elect one particular mechanism . . . even if that \nmechanism arguably might be the most scientifically advanced method.”).  \nIn addition to misunderstanding the classification at issue, the majority \nerroneously redefines the privacy interests at stake. Although the majority \nconcedes that protecting bathroom privacy, in some abstract sense, is an important \n  59   \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00739-TJC-JBT   Document 207   Filed 08/10/20   Page 60 of 78 PageID 11142\nCase: 18-13592     Date Filed: 08/07/2020     Page: 60 of 74 \n   \nobjective, it rejects both of the privacy interests that the school policy protects. For \nthe first interest, the majority asserts that the Board incorrectly decided that its \nstudents had any privacy interest in using the bathroom away from “students who \ndo not share the same birth sex.” Majority Op. at 21 (internal quotation marks \nomitted). And although the majority appears to acknowledge that students have a \nprivacy interest in not exposing their bodies, it does not accept that this interest can \nbe sex-specific—that the interest is heightened when exposure is to the opposite \nsex. Instead, it asserts not only that Adams’s “anatomical differences” from boys \nare “irrelevant” to bathroom privacy, id. at 24, but also that thinking otherwise is \nan unconstitutional stereotype, id. at 25–28. \nThe majority’s understanding of each interest contravenes precedent. Its \ndecision to limit students’ privacy interest to bodily exposure ignores that children \nalso have a distinct privacy interest in using the bathroom away from the opposite \nsex. See, e.g., Virginia, 518 U.S. at 550 n.19; Chaney, 612 F.3d at 913; Faulkner, \n10 F.3d at 232; Cumbey, 684 F.2d at 714; see also Skinner v. Ry. Labor Execs.’ \nAss’n, 489 U.S. 602, 626 (1989) (concluding that urination is “an excretory \nfunction traditionally shielded by great privacy”). Similarly, the majority’s failure \nto acknowledge that the privacy interest in avoiding bodily exposure is heightened \nwhen children of the opposite sex are present ignores longstanding precedent, not \nto mention common sense. See, e.g., Fortner, 983 F.2d at 1030; Harris, 818 F.3d at \n  60   \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00739-TJC-JBT   Document 207   Filed 08/10/20   Page 61 of 78 PageID 11143\nCase: 18-13592     Date Filed: 08/07/2020     Page: 61 of 74 \n   \n59; Luzerne Cty., 660 F.3d at 177; Overton Cty., 516 F.3d at 494; Canedy, 16 F.3d \nat 185. \nFinally, the majority’s alternative contention that the privacy interests at \nissue are invalid because they rest on impermissible sex stereotypes is incorrect. \nAccording to the majority, the school policy “presumed every person deemed \n‘male’ at birth would act and identify as a ‘boy’ and every person deemed ‘female’ \nwould act and identify as a ‘girl.’” Majority Op. at 26. The majority also faults the \npolicy for indulging in the purportedly unconstitutional stereotype that “one’s \ngender identity and expression should align with one’s birth sex.” Id. Neither of \nthese arguments has merit.  \nThe majority never explains how the school policy “presume[d] every \nperson deemed ‘male’ at birth would act and identify as a ‘boy’ and every person \ndeemed ‘female’ would act and identify as a ‘girl.’” Nor can it. The policy does not \nturn on how students “act and identify.” It assigns bathrooms by sex, which is not a \nstereotype. See Nguyen, 533 U.S. at 73 (“Mechanistic classification of all our \ndifferences as stereotypes would operate to obscure those misconceptions and \nprejudices that are real.”); Etsitty v. Utah Transit Auth., 502 F.3d 1215, 1224 (10th \nCir. 2007) (“Use of a restroom designated for the opposite sex does not constitute a \nmere failure to conform to sex stereotypes.”). \n  61   \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00739-TJC-JBT   Document 207   Filed 08/10/20   Page 62 of 78 PageID 11144\nCase: 18-13592     Date Filed: 08/07/2020     Page: 62 of 74 \n   \nThe majority’s other contention—that believing “one’s gender identity and \nexpression should align with one’s birth sex” is an unconstitutional stereotype—\nfares no better. The Supreme Court has long grounded its sex-discrimination \njurisprudence in reproductive biology. See, e.g., Nguyen, 533 U.S. at 73 (“The \ndifference between men and women in relation to the birth process is a real one \n. . . .”); Geduldig, 417 U.S. at 496 n.20 (“[I]t is true that only women can become \npregnant . . . .”); see also Virginia, 518 U.S. at 533 (“Physical differences between \nmen and women, however, are enduring: [T]he two sexes are not fungible . . . .” \n(internal quotation marks omitted)). Indeed, the Court’s justification for giving \nheightened scrutiny to sex-based classifications makes sense only with reference to \nphysiology.  \nIn one of its foundational sex-discrimination decisions, the Court justified \nheightened scrutiny this way: “since sex . . . is an immutable characteristic \ndetermined solely by the accident of birth, the imposition of special disabilities \nupon the members of a particular sex because of their sex would seem to violate \nthe basic concept of our system that legal burdens should bear some relationship to \nindividual responsibility.” Frontiero v. Richardson, 411 U.S. 677, 686 (1973) \n(plurality opinion) (internal quotation marks omitted). In other words, the Court \nendorsed heightened scrutiny because laws “distributing benefits and burdens \nbetween the sexes in different ways very likely reflect outmoded notions of the \n  62   \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00739-TJC-JBT   Document 207   Filed 08/10/20   Page 63 of 78 PageID 11145\nCase: 18-13592     Date Filed: 08/07/2020     Page: 63 of 74 \n   \nrelative capabilities of men and women.” Cleburne, 473 U.S. at 441. To say that it \nis an unconstitutional stereotype to believe that “one’s gender identity and \nexpression should align with one’s birth sex,” the majority must not only rewrite \nthe Supreme Court’s physiological rationale for heightened scrutiny of sex-based \nclassifications, but also hold that many of the Court’s sex-discrimination decisions \nturned on an impermissible stereotype. See Nguyen, 533 U.S. at 73; Virginia, 518 \nU.S. at 533; Geduldig, 417 U.S. at 496 n.20; Frontiero, 411 U.S. at 686. We, of \ncourse, cannot take either of those actions.  \nThe majority’s narrow construction of bathroom privacy skews the \nintermediate-scrutiny analysis in favor of Adams. Policies that separate bathrooms \non the basis of sex arise from the understanding that privacy interests are \nsometimes sex specific. By failing to acknowledge any sex-specific privacy \ninterest, the majority demands the impossible: a justification for sex-separated \nbathrooms that does not involve sex. To be sure, the majority suggests that a \ndifferent trial record—one that contained evidence that Adams or other transgender \nstudents “harass[ed] or peep[ed] at” other students in the bathroom—might support \nthe bathroom policy. Majority Op. at 21. But that evidence would not justify a sex-\nbased classification. If voyeurism is equally problematic whether it occurs between \nchildren of the same or opposite sex, then separating bathrooms by sex would not \nadvance any interest in combatting voyeurism. Only single-stall bathrooms could \n  63   \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00739-TJC-JBT   Document 207   Filed 08/10/20   Page 64 of 78 PageID 11146\nCase: 18-13592     Date Filed: 08/07/2020     Page: 64 of 74 \n   \naddress that concern. Further, under intermediate scrutiny, an invidious stereotype \nabout members of a suspect class cannot justify a discriminatory policy “even \nwhen some statistical support can be conjured up for the generalization.” J.E.B. v. \nAla. ex rel. T.B., 511 U.S. 127, 139 n.11 (1994). So evidence that children of a \nparticular sex—or transgender students under the majority’s perspective—are \nlikely to “harass or peep at” members of the opposite sex could not justify sex-\nseparated bathrooms.  \nOnly after it replaces both of the inquiries relevant to intermediate \nscrutiny—the “discriminatory means employed” by the policy and the privacy \ninterests at issue, Virginia, 518 U.S. at 533 (internal quotation marks omitted)—\ndoes the majority conclude that the school policy does not substantially advance its \nobjective to protect privacy. The end result is an opinion on sex discrimination that \nlooks nothing like an intermediate-scrutiny inquiry into whether a sex-based \nclassification satisfies the Equal Protection Clause. \nThe majority’s redefinition of intermediate scrutiny will have consequences \nfar beyond the confines of this appeal. The logic of its opinion would invalidate all \ngovernment policies that separate bathrooms—or locker rooms and showers, for \nthat matter—by sex. To be sure, the majority “assume[s]” that the government can \npromote privacy interests by separating bathrooms by sex, and it insists that the \nlawfulness of sex-separated locker rooms is not before it. Majority Op. at 8 n.3, 14. \n  64   \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00739-TJC-JBT   Document 207   Filed 08/10/20   Page 65 of 78 PageID 11147\nCase: 18-13592     Date Filed: 08/07/2020     Page: 65 of 74 \n   \nBut anyone can take advantage of the majority’s demolition of sex-specific \nbathroom privacy.  \nThat the majority purports to invalidate the school policy only as it applies to \nAdams changes nothing. See Bucklew, 139 S. Ct. at 1127. The majority does not \noffer a meaningful way to distinguish this appeal from one that challenges sex-\nseparated bathrooms and locker rooms. It only insists that the issue is not before it. \nBut do not be fooled: future plaintiffs can still leverage the majority’s narrow view \nof privacy. Ultimately, if the privacy interest at stake is untethered from using the \nbathroom away from the opposite sex or from biological differences between the \nsexes, then no justification exists for separating bathrooms—or any related \nfacility—by sex. \nWhen shorn of the majority’s misunderstandings of the school policy and the \nlegal standards that govern sex-based classifications, this appeal is straightforward. \nThe school policy protects longstanding privacy interests inherent in using the \nbathroom, and it does so in an ancient and unremarkable way—by separating \nbathrooms on the basis of sex. That policy is not unconstitutional. \nB. The Bathroom Policy Does Not Violate Title IX. \nTitle IX mandates that no person “shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded \nfrom participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination \nunder any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.” 20 \n  65   \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00739-TJC-JBT   Document 207   Filed 08/10/20   Page 66 of 78 PageID 11148\nCase: 18-13592     Date Filed: 08/07/2020     Page: 66 of 74 \n   \nU.S.C. § 1681(a). But an important qualification tempers this mandate: “nothing \ncontained herein shall be construed to prohibit any educational institution receiving \nfunds under this Act, from maintaining separate living facilities for the different \nsexes.” Id. § 1686. The implementing regulations clarify that institutions “may \nprovide separate toilet, locker room, and shower facilities on the basis of sex, but \nsuch facilities provided for students of one sex shall be comparable to such \nfacilities provided for students of the other sex.” 34 C.F.R. § 106.33. \nWhether the Board violated Title IX turns on the answer to one question: \nwhat does “sex” mean in Title IX? Regardless of whether separating bathrooms by \nsex would otherwise constitute discrimination “on the basis of sex,” 20 U.S.C. \n§ 1681(a), the bathroom policy does not violate Title IX if it falls within the safe \nharbor for “separate toilet . . . facilities on the basis of sex.” 34 C.F.R § 106.33. \nAnd if the school policy is valid under Title IX, then Title IX also permits the \nschools to require all students, including Adams, to follow that policy. Cf. Antonin \nScalia & Bryan A. Garner, Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts § 30, at \n192–93 (2012) (“[W]henever a power is given by a statute, everything necessary to \nmaking it effectual or requisite to attaining the end is implied.” (quoting 1 James \nKent, Commentaries on American Law *464)).  \nContrary to the majority’s and Adams’s arguments otherwise, the Supreme \nCourt did not resolve this question in Bostock. Far from it. Not only did the Court \n  66   \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00739-TJC-JBT   Document 207   Filed 08/10/20   Page 67 of 78 PageID 11149\nCase: 18-13592     Date Filed: 08/07/2020     Page: 67 of 74 \n   \n“proceed on the assumption that ‘sex’ . . . refer[s] only to biological distinctions \nbetween male and female,” it disclaimed deciding whether Title VII allows for sex-\nseparated bathrooms. Bostock, 140 S. Ct. at 1739, 1753. And any guidance Bostock \nmight otherwise provide about whether Title VII allows for sex-separated \nbathrooms does not extend to Title IX, which permits schools to act on the basis of \nsex through sex-separated bathrooms. See 20 U.S.C. § 1686; 34 C.F.R. § 106.33. \nTurning to the provisions at issue, this question is not close. As used in Title \nIX and its implementing regulations, “sex” unambiguously is a classification on \nthe basis of reproductive function. We must, of course, give words in statutes the \nordinary meaning they conveyed when Congress enacted them. See New Prime \nInc. v. Oliveira, 139 S. Ct. 532, 539 (2019); Scalia & Garner, Reading Law §§ 6–7, \nat 69–71, 78–79. And “sex” has never meant gender identity. See, e.g., Sex, The \nAmerican Heritage Dictionary of the English Language (1979) (“The property or \nquality by which organisms are classified according to their reproductive \nfunctions.”); Sex, The Random House College Dictionary (1980) (“either the male \nor female division of a species, esp. as differentiated with reference to the \nreproductive functions”); see also Am. Psychiatric Ass’n, Diagnostic and \nStatistical Manual of Mental Disorders 451 (5th ed. 2013) (“This chapter employs \nconstructs and terms as they are widely used by clinicians from various disciplines \nwith specialization in this area. In this chapter, sex and sexual refer to the \n  67   \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00739-TJC-JBT   Document 207   Filed 08/10/20   Page 68 of 78 PageID 11150\nCase: 18-13592     Date Filed: 08/07/2020     Page: 68 of 74 \n   \nbiological indicators of male and female (understood in the context of reproductive \ncapacity) . . . .”).  \nThat “sex” did not mean gender identity is unsurprising. When Congress \nenacted Title IX in 1972, psychiatric literature conflated sexual orientation with \ngender identity. See Jack Drescher, Transsexualism, Gender Identity Disorder and \nthe DSM, 14 J. Gay & Lesbian Mental Health 109, 111 (2010). And as with \nhomosexuality, a common belief among psychiatrists was that “trans people [were] \nseverely mentally disturbed.” See id. at 114, 116–17. Indeed, the American \nPsychiatric Association first classified “Gender Identity Disorders” as \npsychosexual disorders in which a person’s internal sense of gender did not align \nwith his or her anatomy. See Am. Psychiatric Ass’n, Diagnostic and Statistical \nManual of Mental Disorders 261 (3d ed. 1980). Consistent with this view, \n“[m]ainstream medical thinking” when Title IX became law was firmly opposed to \nsex-reassignment surgery. Drescher, supra, at 111–12. Even among its proponents, \n“[s]ex reassignment was . . . considered not a cure, but a palliative treatment.” \nDallas Denny, A Selective Bibliography of Transsexualism, 6 J. Gay & Lesbian \nPsychotherapy 35, 38 (2002). It is untenable to construe transgender status, which \neven the medical community saw as a departure from the norm, as altering the \nnorm itself among the general public. \n  68   \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00739-TJC-JBT   Document 207   Filed 08/10/20   Page 69 of 78 PageID 11151\nCase: 18-13592     Date Filed: 08/07/2020     Page: 69 of 74 \n   \nIn deciding otherwise, the majority erroneously concludes that the safe \nharbor for bathrooms does not apply because Title IX and its regulations do not \n“declare” whether “sex” as applied to Adams is the “sex identified at birth”—\nfemale—or the sex listed on Adams’s amended birth certificate and driver’s \nlicense—male. Majority Op. at 40–41 (quoting Bostock, 140 S. Ct. at 1746). But \nthe ordinary meaning of “sex” in the safe-harbor provision does not change when a \nplaintiff is transgender. See Cochise Consultancy, Inc. v. U.S. ex rel. Hunt, 139 S. \nCt. 1507, 1512 (2019) (“In all but the most unusual situations, a single use of a \nstatutory phrase must have a fixed meaning.”). And as explained above, the \nordinary meaning of “sex” when Congress enacted Title IX turned on reproductive \nfunction. That Congress did not define “sex” does not change this conclusion. See \nUnited States v. Sepulveda, 115 F.3d 882, 886 n.9 (11th Cir. 1997) (“[A] statute is \nnot ambiguous merely because it contains a term without a statutory definition.”). \nAnd under the unambiguous meaning of “sex” in the safe-harbor provision, the \nBoard did not violate Title IX when it prohibited Adams from using the boys’ \nbathroom.  \nInstead of grappling with the meaning of “sex,” the majority abdicates its \nduty to interpret the law. According to the majority, it is unnecessary to delve into \nthe meaning of “sex” in Title IX because the safe harbor “does not dictate how \nschools should approach transgender students’ restroom use.” Majority Op. at 42. \n  69   \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00739-TJC-JBT   Document 207   Filed 08/10/20   Page 70 of 78 PageID 11152\nCase: 18-13592     Date Filed: 08/07/2020     Page: 70 of 74 \n   \nBut courts regularly apply general standards of law to particular facts, and the \nBoard asks this Court to apply the safe-harbor provision to the facts in this appeal. \nBy declaring it not “necessary” to interpret the safe-harbor provision, the majority \nabandons statutory interpretation in favor of legislating a transgender exception to \nthe safe-harbor provision. This approach offends basic principles of statutory \ninterpretation. See Scalia & Garner, Reading Law § 8, at 93 (“The principle that a \nmatter not covered is not covered is so obvious that it seems absurd to recite it. The \njudge should not presume that every statute answers every question . . . . Nor \nshould the judge elaborate unprovided-for exceptions to a text . . . .”); EEOC v. \nAbercrombie & Fitch Stores, Inc., 135 S. Ct. 2028, 2033 (2015) (“We construe [a \nstatute’s] silence as exactly that: silence.”). \nIndeed, the majority turns Title IX on its head by requiring a clear statement \nfrom Congress that the safe harbor protects the Board. Because Congress enacted \nTitle IX under its Spending Clause power, U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 1, the Board’s \nviolation must be unambiguous to trigger liability. Although the Spending Clause \nallows Congress to “attach conditions on the receipt of federal funds,” South \nDakota v. Dole, 483 U.S. 203, 206 (1987), “[t]he legitimacy of Congress’ power to \nlegislate under the spending power . . . rests on whether the State voluntarily and \nknowingly accepts the terms of the ‘contract.’” Pennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. v. \nHalderman, 451 U.S. 1, 17 (1981). In other words, “if Congress intends to impose \n  70   \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00739-TJC-JBT   Document 207   Filed 08/10/20   Page 71 of 78 PageID 11153\nCase: 18-13592     Date Filed: 08/07/2020     Page: 71 of 74 \n   \na condition on the grant of federal moneys, it must do so unambiguously.” Id. This \nrequirement unquestionably applies when courts interpret Title IX. See Davis ex \nrel. D. v. Monroe Cty. Bd. of Educ., 526 U.S. 629, 649–50 (1999). It also applies \nwhen the appellant fails to press the issue in the district court. See Jefferson v. \nSewon Am., Inc., 891 F.3d 911, 923 (11th Cir. 2018) (“[P]arties cannot waive the \napplication of the correct law.”). So even if the majority were correct that “sex” \nwas ambiguous, Title IX still would not prohibit the Board’s actions. Instead, the \nBoard would lose the protection of the bathroom safe harbor only if the meaning of \n“sex” unambiguously did not turn on reproductive function. \nFor its part, the district court ruled that the Board violated Title IX for \ndifferent but equally flawed reasons. It first ruled that the meaning of “sex” in Title \nIX was ambiguous because the statute did not define the term and dictionary \ndefinitions of “sex” were not “so universally clear” at the time. It then held that our \ndecision in Glenn v. Brumby, 663 F.3d 1312, and the Supreme Court’s decision in \nPrice Waterhouse v. Hopkins, 490 U.S. 228 (1989) (plurality opinion), supported \nits conclusion that “sex” in Title IX “includes ‘gender identity’ for purposes of its \napplication to transgender students.”  \nA statutory term is not ambiguous solely because a statute does not define it \nor because an isolated dictionary suggests a divergent meaning. See Brown v. \nGardner, 513 U.S. 115, 118 (1994) (“Ambiguity is a creature not of definitional \n  71   \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00739-TJC-JBT   Document 207   Filed 08/10/20   Page 72 of 78 PageID 11154\nCase: 18-13592     Date Filed: 08/07/2020     Page: 72 of 74 \n   \npossibilities but of statutory context . . . .”). Further, the only purportedly \ncompeting definition the district court found—that “sex” means “the character of \nbeing either male or female,” Sex, American College Dictionary (1970)—supports \na biological meaning of sex. That dictionary defined “female” and “male” in \nphysiological, reproductive terms. See Female, id. (“a human being of the sex \nwhich conceives and brings forth young; a woman or girl”); Male, id. (“belonging \nto the sex which begets young, or any division or group corresponding to it”). The \ndistrict court had no reason to conclude that the term was ambiguous.  \nThe decision to resolve the purported ambiguity as applied to transgender \nstudents with Price Waterhouse and Glenn fares no better. Like the majority, the \ndistrict court erred by assuming that “sex” could have different meanings as \napplied to transgender and non-transgender persons. See Cochise Consultancy, 139 \nS. Ct. at 1512. Further, neither Price Waterhouse nor Glenn redefined the meaning \nof “sex.” They held only that when an employer acts against a member of one sex \nfor failing to conform to stereotypes associated with that sex—for example, \ndressing like the opposite sex—that employer has acted because of sex. See Price \nWaterhouse, 490 U.S. at 250 (holding that an employer discriminated on the basis \nof sex when he “act[ed] on the basis of a belief that a woman cannot be aggressive, \nor that she must not be”); Glenn, 663 F.3d at 1318–19 (“All persons, whether \ntransgender or not, are protected from discrimination on the basis of gender \n  72   \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00739-TJC-JBT   Document 207   Filed 08/10/20   Page 73 of 78 PageID 11155\nCase: 18-13592     Date Filed: 08/07/2020     Page: 73 of 74 \n   \nstereotype. . . . Because these protections are afforded to everyone, they cannot be \ndenied to a transgender individual.”). Whether or not the Board based its policy on \nsex stereotypes does not matter for this claim because that question would \ndetermine only whether the Board acted “on the basis of sex.” 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a). \nTitle IX and its regulations expressly allow the Board to do so to provide separate \nbathrooms. See id. § 1686; 34 C.F.R. § 106.33. \nLike the majority, the district court also failed to grapple with the fact that \nCongress enacted Title IX under its Spending Clause power. As explained above, \nthe district court could impose liability only if it concluded that the meaning of \n“sex” in Title IX unambiguously did not turn on reproductive function. In other \nwords, even if the district court were correct that “sex” was ambiguous and that the \nbest interpretation of “sex” when Congress enacted Title IX was gender identity—\nand, to reiterate, it was not on either count—Title IX still would not prohibit a \nschool from separating bathrooms on the basis of sex.  \n*  *  * \nThe majority transforms an appeal that it should have resolved with \nstraightforward applications of intermediate scrutiny and statutory interpretation \ninto something unrecognizable. Almost no aspect of its analysis emerges \nunscathed. The majority misunderstands the policy at issue, ignores decades of \nprecedent, dismisses any sex-specific interest in bathroom privacy, and flouts \n  73   \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00739-TJC-JBT   Document 207   Filed 08/10/20   Page 74 of 78 PageID 11156\nCase: 18-13592     Date Filed: 08/07/2020     Page: 74 of 74 \n   \nfoundational principles of statutory interpretation. In the process, it issues a \nholding with radical consequences for sex-separated bathrooms. But for all of its \nerrors, the majority opinion cannot obscure what should have been the bottom line \nof this appeal: there is nothing unlawful, under either the Constitution or federal \nlaw, about a policy that separates bathrooms for schoolchildren on the basis of sex.  \nI dissent. \n \n  74   \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00739-TJC-JBT   Document 207   Filed 08/10/20   Page 75 of 78 PageID 11157\nCase: 18-13592     Date Filed: 08/07/2020     Page: 1 of 1 \nUNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS \nFOR THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT \nELBERT PARR TUTTLE COURT OF APPEALS BUILDING \n56 Forsyth Street, N.W. \nAtlanta, Georgia 30303 \nDavid J.

JOHNS \nCOUNTY, FLORIDA,  \n       \nDefendant.  \n \n \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY, INJUNCTIVE, AND \nOTHER RELIEF  \n \nINTRODUCTION \n1.  Drew Adams (“Drew” or “Plaintiff”)1 is a 16-year-old boy who attends Allen \nD. Nease High School (“Nease High School”) in Ponte Vedra, Florida.  Drew entered his \njunior year in August of 2017.  Drew is active in his local community, having received an \naward for his volunteerism, and is preparing for a future career as an adolescent psychiatrist \nby volunteering at the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville.  Drew plays four musical instruments, \nand like many other kids his age, enjoys video games.  Drew also is transgender.  As a result, \nunfortunately, he has been subjected to discrimination at his school on a daily basis \nbeginning in 2015.   \n                                                             \n1 Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 5.2(h), Drew Adams waives the privacy protections afforded by Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 5.2(a). \n1 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00739-TJC-JBT   Document 60   Filed 09/07/17   Page 2 of 24 PageID 2066\n2.  Although Drew is a hard-working, high-achieving student, the school has \ndiscriminated against him by refusing him access to and use of the boys’ restrooms.  This \nconduct has a negative and harmful impact on Drew, branding him as unfit to share the \ncommunal restrooms that all other boys use simply because he is transgender.  Drew simply \nwants to be treated like other boys so that he too can focus on school, rather than the \nhumiliation of being denied access to the facilities all others use for one of life’s most basic \nfunctions.  The discriminatory policy at issue characterizes Drew as different and stigmatizes \nhim because he is transgender.  This sends a powerful signal to others not to treat Drew as \nany other boy. \n3.  Drew seeks a declaratory judgment that his exclusion from the boys’ restroom \nby Defendant The School Board of St. Johns County, Florida (“Defendant,” “Defendant \nSchool Board,” or “School Board”) violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth \nAmendment to the U.S. Constitution and Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, 20 \nU.S.C. § 1681, et seq. (“Title IX”).  Drew also seeks injunctive relief enjoining Defendant \nfrom denying him equal access to the boys’ restroom, and compensatory, as well as nominal, \ndamages against Defendant School Board for the violation of Drew’s rights under the \nFourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and Title IX. \nPARTIES \n4.  Plaintiff Drew Adams is a 16-year-old boy who attends Nease High School \nwithin the St. Johns County School District (the “District”).  Drew is transgender.  As a \nstudent enrolled at Nease High School, Drew is subject to the policies of Defendant, \nincluding Defendant’s policy, custom, or usage of barring transgender students from using \n2 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00739-TJC-JBT   Document 60   Filed 09/07/17   Page 3 of 24 PageID 2067\nrestrooms that match their gender identity, while allowing non-transgender students to use \nthe restrooms that match their gender identity.  Drew sues pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 17(c) by and through his next friend and mother Erica Adams Kasper (“Erica”). \n5.  Defendant The School Board of St. Johns County, Florida, in accordance with \nthe provisions of section 4(b) of Art. IX of the State Constitution and Fla. Stat. § 1001.32(2), \noperates, controls, and supervises all public schools in the District, including Nease High \nSchool.  The School Board is empowered to determine the policies necessary for the \neffective operation of the school system, including the policy, custom, or usage challenged \nhere that bars transgender students, and only transgender students, from using restrooms that \nmatch their gender identity.  As a political subdivision of the State of Florida, the School \nBoard is subject to civil suits pursuant to  Fla. Stat. § 1001.41(4) and is a “person” acting \nunder color of state law within the meaning of 42 U.S.C.  § 1983. \n6.  Defendant, through its duties and obligations, is responsible for the exclusion \nof Drew from the boys’ restrooms within the school district.

Drew is 16 years old, and began his junior year at Nease High School on \nAugust 10, 2017.  \n4 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00739-TJC-JBT   Document 60   Filed 09/07/17   Page 5 of 24 PageID 2069\n13.  Drew hopes to attend medical school.  He is an honor student, is enrolled in a \nnumber of Advanced Placement classes in school, and participates in the International \nBaccalaureate (“IB”) Pre-IB/IB Diploma Program.   \n14.  Drew is also active in a number of extra-curricular, volunteer and community \nservice activities.  He is on the Board of Leaders of Nease High School’s Gay Straight \nAlliance, which works to improve the school climate for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and \ntransgender (“LGBT”) students.  Drew previously served on the Student Council for the Gay, \nLesbian, and Straight Education Network (“GLSEN”), which educates people about LGBT \nyouth and does anti-bullying work.  He currently serves on the Youth Ambassador Council \nfor the Trevor Project, which provides suicide prevention services to LGBT youth.  Drew \nhelps raise money each year for the Jacksonville Area Sexual Minority Youth Network \n(“JASMYN”), which provides programs and services to support local LGBT youth.  Starting \nthe summer before high school, Drew has volunteered each summer at a local hospital.  In \nMay of 2017, Drew received the HandsOn Youth in Action Award from HandsOn \nJacksonville, a non-profit that encourages volunteerism in the local community.  He plays \nfour musical instruments and also really enjoys playing video games.  And, like lots of other \nkids his age, Drew wants to be treated equally and accepted for who he is. \n15.  After high school, Drew hopes to attend the University of Florida to study pre-\nmedicine.  Ultimately, he would like to attend medical school and become an adolescent \npsychiatrist.   \n16.  Drew is a boy. \n5 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00739-TJC-JBT   Document 60   Filed 09/07/17   Page 6 of 24 PageID 2070\n17.  Drew also is transgender.  At birth, Drew was incorrectly designated “female” \non his birth certificate, even though he is, in fact, a boy. \n18.  Each person has multiple sex-related characteristics, including hormones, \nexternal and internal morphological features, external and internal reproductive organs, \nchromosomes, and gender identity.  These characteristics may not always be in alignment.  \n19.  The phrase “sex assigned at birth” refers to the sex recorded on a person’s \nbirth certificate at the time of birth.  Typically, a person is assigned a sex on their birth \ncertificate solely on the basis of the appearance of external reproductive organs at the time of \nbirth.  Other sex-related characteristics (such as a person’s chromosomal makeup and gender \nidentity, for example) are typically not assessed or considered at the time of birth. \n20.  Gender identity—a person’s core internal sense of their own gender—is the \nprimary factor in determining a person’s sex.  Every person has a gender identity.  There is a \nmedical consensus that gender identity is innate and that efforts to change a person’s gender \nidentity are unethical and harmful to a person’s health and well-being. \n21.  Transgender persons are people whose gender identity diverges from the sex \nthey were assigned at birth.  A transgender boy’s sex is male (even though he was assigned \nthe sex of female at birth) and a transgender girl’s sex is female (even though she was \nassigned the sex of male at birth).  \n22.  Cisgender persons are people whose gender identity aligns with the sex they \nwere assigned at birth.  A cisgender boy’s sex is male (matching his assigned sex of male at \nbirth) and a cisgender girl’s sex is female (matching her assigned sex of female at birth).  \n6 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00739-TJC-JBT   Document 60   Filed 09/07/17   Page 7 of 24 PageID 2071\n23.  The incongruence between a transgender person’s gender identity and sex \nassigned at birth can sometimes be associated with gender dysphoria.  Gender dysphoria is a \nserious medical condition recognized in the American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic \nand Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Ed. (2013) (“DSM-V”), and by the other \nleading medical and mental health professional groups, including the American Medical \nAssociation and the American Psychological Association. \n24.  Gender dysphoria refers to clinically significant distress that can result when a \nperson’s gender identity differs from the person’s sex assigned at birth.  If left untreated, \ngender dysphoria may result in psychological distress, anxiety, depression, and even suicidal \nideation or self-harm.  \n25.  Treatment of gender dysphoria is usually provided pursuant to the Standards \nof Care for the Health of Transsexual, Transgender, and Gender Nonconforming People \n(“Standards of Care”), published by the World Professional Association of Transgender \nHealth.  The Standards of Care are recognized as authoritative by major medical and mental \nhealth professional organizations.  \n26.  Treatments for gender dysphoria align the transgender person’s body and \nlived experience with the person’s true sex.  Steps that transgender people may take to treat \ntheir gender dysphoria pursuant to the Standards of Care include: (1) social transition; (2) \nhormone therapy; and/or (3) gender-affirming surgery. These treatments do not change a \ntransgender person’s sex, which is determined by their gender identity.   \n27.  Social transition entails a transgender person living in accordance with the \nperson’s gender identity.  For example, for a transgender boy, social transition can include, \n7 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00739-TJC-JBT   Document 60   Filed 09/07/17   Page 8 of 24 PageID 2072\namong other things, changing his first name to a name typically associated with boys, using \nmale pronouns, changing his identity documents to indicate a male gender, wearing clothing \nand adopting grooming habits stereotypically associated with boys, using restrooms and other \nfacilities for boys, and otherwise living as a boy in all aspects of life.   \n28.  Social transition requires that a transgender boy be recognized as a boy and \ntreated the same as all other boys by family members, educators, and others in the \ncommunity.   \n29.  The ability to live in a manner consistent with one’s gender identity is critical \nto the health and well-being of all transgender people.  \n30.  Living in a manner consistent with one’s gender identity, including the use of \nrestroom facilities that match one’s gender identity, also is a key aspect of treatment for \ngender dysphoria for those who suffer from it.   \n31.  Even though Drew’s sex assigned at birth was female, and even before he was \naware that transgender people existed, Drew knew that his body did not feel like it fit him.  \nErica saw that he was having a difficult time too.  She saw that he was becoming increasingly \nanxious, depressed, and withdrawn as he went through female puberty.   \n32.  Drew first began to understand why he felt the way he did when he was 14 \nyears old, and saw a transgender man interviewed on television.  When Drew heard the man \ndescribe what it meant to be transgender, everything clicked for Drew, and he immediately \nrealized that he felt the same way.  Erica was watching television with Drew at the time, and \nnoticed right away how mesmerized he was by the interview; she felt like she could see the \nwheels turning in his head. \n8 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00739-TJC-JBT   Document 60   Filed 09/07/17   Page 9 of 24 PageID 2073\n33.  Erica had a moment of dread, and thought to herself, “things are about to get \nreally hard.”  But she also knew that Drew was profoundly unhappy, so she waited for Drew \nto become ready to talk to her.  Not long after, her son came out as transgender.   \n34.  Drew began researching what it meant to be transgender, and in 2015 began \ntaking steps toward aligning his lived experience with his gender identity, i.e., living as a \nboy.  Drew cut his hair short, and began wearing a binder on his chest to minimize the \nappearance of his breasts.  Each step brought him a sense of relief and happiness, and he felt \nlike he was finally starting to live the way he was meant to live.  This confirmed for Drew \nthat transitioning was the only way he would ever feel fully comfortable in his own skin.   \n35.  Drew has since been diagnosed with gender dysphoria, and that diagnosis has \nbeen confirmed by multiple providers.   \n36.  Drew is receiving medical treatment through the Duke Child and Adolescent \nGender Care (“Duke Clinic”) in North Carolina.  Drew began taking testosterone in June \n2016, and he remembers thinking that was the happiest day of his life.  When Drew learned \nthat he could get “top surgery” (a double mastectomy to masculinize his chest), he was so \novercome with joy that he cried.  Erica also saw a dramatic change in Drew’s happiness and \nwellbeing.  As he continued to transition, Drew became an increasingly confident and \npositive kid.  As a result, Erica quickly realized that transitioning was the only way Drew \ncould ever be truly happy and reach his full potential as a person.   \n37.  Along with taking these medical steps to relieve his gender dysphoria and \nbring his body into alignment with his gender identity, Drew also began taking other steps to \n9 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00739-TJC-JBT   Document 60   Filed 09/07/17   Page 10 of 24 PageID 2074\nlive fully as the boy that he is.  For example, Drew updated the gender marker on his driver’s \nlicense from female to male, in order to have his identification accurately reflect who he is.   \n38.  By the time Drew began his freshman year at Nease High School, he was \nliving full-time as a boy, and wanted to start school as a boy too.  This was especially \nimportant to him because relatively few of the kids who knew him before his transition in \nmiddle school would be attending this high school, which gave him a chance for a fresh start.   \n39.  Before the 2015-2016 school year started, Drew emailed his teachers to \nexplain that the female gender marker on his school records was wrong, and to ask them to \nuse male pronouns for him instead.  He continued using the gender neutral name “Drew” that \nhis parents had given him at birth.   \n40.  When Drew began his freshman year, he was generally perceived by students \nand staff alike as a boy.  His peers and teachers generally used male pronouns, and he was \ngenerally treated as a boy in every respect.   \n41.  When Drew first started at Nease High School in August of 2015, he did not \neven imagine that anyone would try to prevent him from using the boys’ restroom, so he used \nthose restrooms along with all the other boys.  On every occasion, he used one of the stalls.  \n42.  Drew used the boys’ restrooms at school without any incident until on or \naround September 22, 2015, when he was pulled out of class to meet with three guidance \ncounselors, including IB Program guidance counselor Kim Hollis.  The guidance counselors \ninformed him that someone had anonymously reported that he was using the boys’ restroom.  \nDrew was instructed to use a gender neutral restroom from that point forward.   \n10 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00739-TJC-JBT   Document 60   Filed 09/07/17   Page 11 of 24 PageID 2075\n43.  Drew was shocked and confused.  He asked if he had done anything wrong, \nand was told “no.”  That answer was frustrating, because it made Drew feel like he was being \npunished even though he had not done anything to deserve it.  \n44.  Drew did not want to get in trouble or have any disciplinary reports on his \nschool record, so he reluctantly began using gender neutral restrooms at the school, and has \nnot used the boys’ restroom since.  But doing so has had a negative emotional and social \nimpact on Drew, who simply wants to be treated like all of the other boys at the school. \n45.  Using the gender neutral restrooms immediately felt like an insult to Drew’s \nidentity.  He felt humiliated having to walk halfway across the school, passing several boys’ \nrestrooms, to find one of the gender-neutral restrooms to use.  His transgender status was not \nwidely known among the school administrators, and he was anxious about encountering staff \nin the hallway who would have thought he was skipping class if he had said he was going to \nthe restroom – while he was walking past right past a boys’ restroom.  It also created an \ninaccurate and discriminatory distinction between Drew as a boy and all other boys.  Rather \nthan treat Drew equally and in all material respects like a boy, he is singled out as different \nfrom the other boys at the school, which interferes with treatment for his gender dysphoria. \n46.  This discriminatory environment has resulted in Drew’s avoiding using the \nrestroom at all, whenever he could physically manage it, so as not to subject himself to this \ndemeaning treatment.  He began restricting his fluid intake and planning his day around \nwhen he might have to use the restroom.  He worried about what other students would think \nif they saw him going to the gender neutral restrooms.  Despite the fact that this meant \nmissing class, Drew would sometimes attempt to go to the restroom in the middle of the \n11 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00739-TJC-JBT   Document 60   Filed 09/07/17   Page 12 of 24 PageID 2076\nclass, so that fewer students in the hallways would see him walking past the boys’ restrooms \nto a special restroom instead.  Drew also held his bladder as much as he could, which was \nextremely – at times, excruciatingly – uncomfortable.  Erica recalls Drew needing to rush \nhome to use the restroom at the end of the school day after trying to hold his bladder for \nhours.   \n47.  In addition, unlike the boys’ restrooms located throughout the school, the \ngender neutral restrooms on the campus are far fewer in number and often far less accessible.  \nFor example, during Drew’s current class schedule, he does not have access to a gender \nneutral restroom in any of the buildings where his classes are held before lunch.  When he \nneeds to use a restroom during, or in between, any of those classes, he must walk much \nfarther than his classmates to reach a gender neutral restroom.  It is not feasible to do so \nbased on the location of his classes without missing some class time.  This is extremely \nstressful, given that every minute of class time in his advanced classes matters.  It forces \nDrew to weigh the importance of the information that he would miss in class, against the \nanxiety, stress, and distraction that come with trying to hold one’s bladder.  This creates a \nHobson’s choice for Drew, one that forces him to choose between the importance of learning \nand being present in class, with the physiological need to use the restroom.  Ignoring that \nphysiological need can be incredibly uncomfortable, and when Drew holds his bladder that \nmakes it difficult to concentrate or participate equally in class.  Equally as bad is the constant \nreminder that he is being treated differently and not accepted for who he is, something \nimportant for anyone, much less a young man in Drew’s situation.  No cisgender boy at the \nschool has to cope with this kind of discriminatory burden.   \n12 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00739-TJC-JBT   Document 60   Filed 09/07/17   Page 13 of 24 PageID 2077\n48.  Given the importance of living as a boy in all respects, this distinction creates \nan emotional and social hardship on Drew.  Defendant’s policy creates a false and \ndiscriminatory distinction by separating Drew from other boys; this differential treatment \ncauses Drew to feel anxious by reinforcing a message that he is “different,” rather than \nsimply allowing him to live as he is:  a boy.  The policy is a constant reinforcement by \nDefendant that it does not view Drew as a real boy and believes he should be treated \ndifferently.  This creates and nurtures a stigma that has no place in the school system and \ntelecasts to others that Drew should not be treated as a boy in all respects.    \n49.  Defendant’s policy also caused Erica to feel hurt and angry as she observed \nthe enormous toll that the policy took on Drew.  She tried to address it with school officials \nin an effort to avoid taking legal action.  Erica sent letters to Principal Dresback and \nSuperintendent Joyner right after Drew was first instructed on September 22, 2015 not to use \nboys’ restrooms, requesting that he be treated as equal to all other boys in the school.  \nSuperintendent Joyner never responded to her letter.  Erica and Drew then met with Principal \nDresback, social workers Holly Arkin and Christy McKendrick, and Director of Student \nServices Sallyanne Smith in early October 2015.  Erica and Drew were told during the \nmeeting that this was “a District issue,” and that the school’s hands were tied.   \n50.  Erica met with District officials on or around November 23 or 24, 2015, \nincluding Associate Superintendent Cathy Mittelstadt and Assistant Superintendent Brennan \nAsplen.  Mr. Asplen repeatedly raised the issue of “biology” during the meeting, which he \nused to refer to genitals.  Erica had brought an assortment of studies, articles, and other \nmaterials about transgender students to help the District officials understand how important \n13 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00739-TJC-JBT   Document 60   Filed 09/07/17   Page 14 of 24 PageID 2078\nequal treatment is, but Mr. Asplen explained his view that “98% of the people in this District \nwould not understand” if Drew were allowed to use the boys’ restroom.  Mr. Asplen said he \nwas more concerned about legal action by the parent of a cisgender child than legal action by \nDrew.  Erica offered during that meeting, and later via email, to help educate other parents in \nthe district about transgender children, but was rebuffed.  Mr. Asplen again focused his \nattention on the issue of genitals and asked what would happen if a transgender girl were to \ncome out of a stall and “wave her penis around.”  Erica said words to the effect of, “Sir, I \ndon’t know what kind of bathrooms you’ve been in, but I’ve never seen a naked person in a \nbathroom.”  Erica pointed out that lewd behavior by any student is already against the law.  \nUnfortunately, Mr. Asplen’s comments are precisely the type that foster negative stereotypes \nand misperceptions, all of which are both discriminatory and unsupported by any evidence, \nmeaning that there is no evidence that a transgender child is any more likely to engage in \ninappropriate behavior.  Comments like these highlight the discriminatory nature of the \npolicy itself, one predicated on others’ unsupported fears, rather than actual evidence. \n51.  Erica contacted the U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights \n(“OCR”) in November 2015 to file a complaint, and OCR opened an investigation.  OCR \noffered District officials an opportunity to mediate the matter, but the District declined.  \nOCR’s assigned investigator conducted a full investigation, later suggesting that Erica meet \nwith officials again to see if the issue could be resolved.  On April 8, 2016, Erica met with \nMs. Mittelstadt, Ms. Arkin, and Ms. McKendrick.  Ms. Mittelstadt described this as a “civil \nrights issue,” but said that the district is “too conservative” and “not there yet.”  Erica pointed \nout that other Florida school districts, like Broward County Public Schools, treat their \n14 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00739-TJC-JBT   Document 60   Filed 09/07/17   Page 15 of 24 PageID 2079\ntransgender students equally in restrooms.  Unfortunately, the meeting too yielded no \nprogress.  Erica and Drew met again with Ms. Mittelstadt on May 4, 2016, but they were \nonce again unsuccessful in securing a policy change that would allow Drew equal access to \nthe boys’ restrooms.   \n52.  Throughout the summer of 2016 and the 2016-2017 school year, and still \nhoping to avoid taking legal action, Erica reached out to OCR officials on other occasions to \nascertain the status of their investigation into Defendant’s discriminatory policy.  Her efforts \nwere in vain.  Following the rescission on February 22, 2017 of prior guidance clarifying the \nscope of Title IX’s protections of transgender students by OCR and the U.S Department of \nJustice, Erica and Drew came to the conclusion that they OCR would no longer be able to \naddress their plight.  As a result, Erica and Drew sought legal representation to take legal \naction against Defendant’s discriminatory policy. \n53.  At no point has any school or District official ever provided Erica or Drew \nwith information suggesting that his use of the boys’ restroom harms anyone else.  When \nDrew is in all other settings outside of school, he uses the men’s restroom.  To Drew’s \nknowledge, there has never been an incident or complaint by others with his restroom use \noutside of school.  Drew has never, and would never, invade anyone else’s privacy in a \nrestroom.  He just wants to use the restroom, wash his hands, and leave like everyone else \ndoes.  He wants to be treated as the normal boy that he is and blend in.   \n54.  Access to the boys’ restroom is important to Drew because he wants to \ninteract with his peers like an equal.  Drew is recognized as the boy that he is in every respect \nby peers and teachers, except at the moment he needs to enter a restroom.  It does not work \n15 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00739-TJC-JBT   Document 60   Filed 09/07/17   Page 16 of 24 PageID 2080\nfor him to be a boy in every other part of his school life, but not when he needs to perform \none of life’s most basic functions.  And, more particularly, it suggests to others a false \ndistinction:  that a transgender boy is not a “real” boy.  Such stigma is not only deleterious \nfor Drew, it is a harmful statement to others, creating a stigma associated with being \ntransgender. \n55.  Being banned from the boys’ restrooms is humiliating to Drew.  It sends a \nsignal to other students that Drew is not a real boy, and treats him as if he is unfit to share a \ncommunal space with others.  It also creates a negative perception and reinforces \nstereotypes—all of which are unfounded—that transgender children are more likely to \nbehave inappropriately or that they are inferior to other children.  Drew feels like he has \nenough to manage in a world that is still learning to understand transgender people without \nhis school making the situation worse, and teaching his peers that he is not worthy of the \nsame dignity and respect as all other boys. \n56.  By mandating and relegating Drew to use single-stall gender neutral \nrestrooms, a condition not imposed on cisgender students, Defendant isolates and separates \nDrew based on his sex and transgender status.  \n57.  By barring Drew from the restrooms consistent with who he is, Defendant \nrefuses to recognize Drew’s gender identity even as it recognizes the gender identity of all of \nhis cisgender peers.  Indeed, through its policy, Defendant effectively seeks to erase and \ninvalidate Drew’s gender identity. \n58.  As a result, Drew has experienced and continues to experience the harmful \neffects of being separated from, and treated differently than, his cisgender classmates of the \n16 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00739-TJC-JBT   Document 60   Filed 09/07/17   Page 17 of 24 PageID 2081\nsame gender identity at Nease High School, including emotional distress, lowered self-\nesteem, embarrassment, humiliation, social isolation, and stigma.  All of these harmful \neffects have also heightened the symptoms, including depression and anxiety, of the gender \ndysphoria suffered by Drew. \n59.  Through its actions, Defendant has purposefully disrupted Drew’s education.   \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nCOUNT I \n \nDenial of Equal Protection \nU.S. Const. Amend. XIV \n \n60.  Plaintiff incorporates paragraphs 1 through 59 as though fully set forth herein. \n61.  Plaintiff challenges, both facially and as applied to him, Defendant’s policy of \nexcluding transgender students from the single-sex facilities that match their gender identity. \n62.  Defendant is a person acting under color of state law for purposes of 42 \nU.S.C. § 1983.   \n63.  Defendant is the final policy maker for Nease High School within the St. \nJohns County School District.   \n64.  The Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, enforceable pursuant to \n42 U.S.C. § 1983, provides that no state shall deny to any person within its jurisdiction the \nequal protection of the laws. \n65.  Defendant’s exclusion of transgender students such as Drew from the single-\nsex facilities matching their gender identity treats transgender students differently from \ncisgender students who are similarly situated.  Under Defendant’s discriminatory policy, \ncisgender students are able to access restrooms and other single-sex facilities consistent with \n17 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00739-TJC-JBT   Document 60   Filed 09/07/17   Page 18 of 24 PageID 2082\ntheir gender identity, but transgender students are banned from single-sex facilities consistent \nwith their gender identity.   \n66.  Discrimination based on sex:  Under the Equal Protection Clause of the \nFourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, discrimination based on sex is \npresumptively unconstitutional and subject to heightened scrutiny. \na.  Discrimination based on sex includes, but is not limited to, \ndiscrimination based on gender, gender nonconformity, transgender status, gender \nexpression, and gender transition.   \nb.  Defendant’s exclusion of Drew from boys’ restrooms in the school \ndistrict discriminates against him on the basis of sex. \nc.  Defendant’s policy also discriminates against Drew based on gender \nnonconformity and sex stereotyping.  For example, although Drew is a boy, is perceived as a \nboy in public, and has had medical treatment to bring his body into alignment with his male \ngender identity, he does not conform to Defendant’s sex-stereotyped expectations for boys \nbecause his sex assigned at birth was female.   \n67.  Discrimination based on transgender status:  Under the Equal Protection \nClause of the Fourteenth Amendment, discrimination based on transgender status is \npresumptively unconstitutional and subject to strict, or at least heightened scrutiny. \na.  Transgender people have suffered a long history of extreme \ndiscrimination in Florida and across the country, and continue to suffer such discrimination to \nthis day. \n18 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00739-TJC-JBT   Document 60   Filed 09/07/17   Page 19 of 24 PageID 2083\nb.  Transgender people are a discrete and insular group and lack the \npolitical power to protect their rights through the legislative process.  Transgender people \nhave largely been unable to secure explicit state and federal protections to protect them \nagainst discrimination.  \nc.  A person’s gender identity or transgender status bears no relation to a \nperson’s ability to contribute to society. \nd.  Gender identity is a core, defining trait and is so fundamental to one’s \nidentity and conscience that a person cannot be required to abandon it as a condition of equal \ntreatment. \ne.  Gender identity generally is fixed at an early age and highly resistant \nto change through intervention. \n68.  Defendant’s discrimination against Drew is not narrowly tailored or \nsubstantially related to any compelling or important government interest.  Indeed, it is not \neven rationally related to any legitimate government interest.  The discriminatory policy does \nnot promote the safety, privacy, security, or well-being of any students, including cisgender \nstudents, but it does undermine the safety and privacy of transgender students such as Drew, \nwho is publicly marked as different and inferior every time he has to access a different \nrestroom from other boys. \n69.  Defendant’s discriminatory policy deprives Drew and other transgender \nstudents of their right to equal dignity, liberty, and autonomy by branding them as second-\nclass citizens.  Defendant thus denies Drew equal protection of the laws in violation of the \nEqual Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. \n19 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00739-TJC-JBT   Document 60   Filed 09/07/17   Page 20 of 24 PageID 2084\n70.  Defendant School Board has conduct is wrongful and violates the Equal \nProtection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, for which Drew is entitled to \ncompensatory, as well as nominal, damages against Defendant School Board. \nCOUNT II \n \nViolation of Title IX \n20 U.S.C. § 1681, et seq. \n \n71.  Plaintiff incorporates paragraphs 1 through 59 as though fully set forth herein. \n72.  Title IX provides that no person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, \nbe excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination \nunder any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.  \n73.  Under Title IX, discrimination on the basis of sex includes, but is not limited \nto, discrimination based on gender, gender nonconformity, transgender status, gender \nexpression, and gender transition. \n74.  Defendant School Board is a recipient of federal financial assistance from the \nUnited States Department of Education, and therefore subject to Title IX. \n75.  Under Defendant School Board’s discriminatory policy, cisgender students \nare able to access restrooms and other single-sex facilities consistent with their gender \nidentity, but transgender students are banned from single-sex facilities consistent with their \ngender identity. \n76.  By banning Drew from access to and use of boys’ restrooms consistent with \nhis gender identity, Defendant School Board excludes Drew from participation in, denies him \nthe benefits of, and subjects him to discrimination in educational programs and activities \nwithin the District, particularly at Nease High School, on the basis of sex, in violation of \n20 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00739-TJC-JBT   Document 60   Filed 09/07/17   Page 21 of 24 PageID 2085\nTitle IX.  For example, Drew’s being forced to access far away gender neutral restrooms \nmeans that Drew must sometimes miss classroom time simply to relieve himself; and when \nDrew attempts to hold his bladder so as not to miss instruction time, he struggles to \nconcentrate on the teacher’s material instead of the significant discomfort of holding his \nbladder.   \n77.  Defendant’s discriminatory exclusion of Drew from boys’ restrooms because \nhe is transgender harms Drew by stigmatizing him and treating him as lesser than other boys, \nwhich causes Drew to experience emotional distress, anxiety, embarrassment, humiliation, \nand pain and anguish.   \n78.  Defendant School Board has intentionally violated and continues to violate \nTitle IX, for which Drew is entitled to compensatory, as well as nominal damages, against \nthe School Board. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in his \nfavor and against Defendant on all claims, as follows:   \nA.  Enter a declaratory judgment that Defendant’s exclusion of Drew from boys’ \nrestrooms within the District violates Drew’s rights under the Equal Protection Clause of the \nFourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution;  \nB.  Enter a declaratory judgment that Defendant School Board’s exclusion of \nDrew from boys’ restrooms within the District violates Drew’s rights under Title IX; \nC.  Issue injunctive relief enjoining Defendant (i) from treating Drew differently \nfrom other boys in any respect, including but not limited to by denying Drew equal access to \n21 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00739-TJC-JBT   Document 60   Filed 09/07/17   Page 22 of 24 PageID 2086\nboys’ restrooms within the District on the same terms as all other boys, and (ii) from denying \nany students, including those who are transgender, from using single-sex multi-user facilities \nin accordance with their gender identity; \nE.  Award Drew, by and through his next friend Erica Adams Kasper, \ncompensatory, as well as nominal, damages against Defendant School Board in an amount \nthat would fully compensate Drew for the emotional distress and suffering, embarrassment, \nhumiliation, pain and anguish, violation of his dignity, and other damages that have been \ncaused by Defendant’s conduct in violation of Drew’s rights under the Fourteenth \nAmendment to the U.S. Constitution and Title IX;   \nF.  Award Drew his costs, expenses, and reasonable attorneys’ fees pursuant to \n42 U.S.C. § 1988 and other applicable laws; and \nG.  Grant such other and further legal and equitable relief as the Court deems \nappropriate, just, and proper. \nH.  The declaratory and injunctive relief requested in this action is sought against \nDefendant and its officers, agents, servants, employees, and attorneys, as well as any other \npersons who are in active concert or participation with them. \n* * * \n \n   \n22 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00739-TJC-JBT   Document 60   Filed 09/07/17   Page 23 of 24 PageID 2087\nDated:  September 7, 2017               Respectfully submitted, \n \n  /s/  Tara L.

JOHNS\nCOUNTY, FLORIDA,\nDefendant.\n                                                                          \nFINDINGS OF FACT AND CONCLUSIONS OF LAW\nThe parents of St. Johns County, along with teachers and administrators of the\nSt. Johns County School District, have a solemn obligation to guard the well-being of\nthe children in their charge.  As recent events from around the country have tragically\ndemonstrated, this is a very challenging job.  Recognizing the difficulty of this task and\nthat local school boards, answerable to the citizens of their community, are best\nsituated to set school policy, federal courts are reluctant to interfere.  Nevertheless,\nthe federal court also has a solemn obligation:  to uphold the Constitution and laws\nof the United States.  That is why federal courts around the country have recognized\nthe right of transgender students to use the bathroom matching their gender identity.\nDrew  Adams  is  a  rising  senior  at  Allen  D.  Nease  High  School.    He  is\ntransgender, meaning he “consistently, persistently, and insistently” identifies as a\n\nCase 3:17-cv-00739-TJC-JBT   Document 192   Filed 07/26/18   Page 2 of 70 PageID 10680\nboy, a gender that is different than the sex he was assigned at birth (female).1  At trial,\nAdams testified: “I am a boy and I know that with every fiber of my being.”2  However,\nwhen the principal of Nease was asked whether she considered Adams to be a boy,\nshe replied, “I do not.”3  That’s what this case is about.  Everyone agrees that boys\nshould use the boys’ restroom at Nease and that girls should use the girls’ restroom. \nThe parties disagree over whether Drew Adams is a boy.\nI can only answer that question with the evidence given to me at trial.  Drew\nAdams says he is a boy and has undergone extensive surgery to conform his body\nto his gender identity; medical science says he is a boy; the State of Florida says so\n(both Adams’ Florida birth certificate and Florida driver’s license say he is a male);\nand the Florida High School Athletic Association says so.  Other than at his school,\nAdams  uses  the  mens’  bathroom  wherever  he  goes,  including  in  this  federal\ncourthouse during trial.  Even the St. Johns County School Board regards Adams as\na boy in every way, except for which bathroom he can use.\nWhen confronted with something affecting our children that is new, outside of\nour experience, and contrary to gender norms we thought we understood, it is natural\nthat parents want to protect their children.  But the evidence is that Drew Adams\n     1Doc. 119, Ex. A at 7.\n     2Doc. 160-1 at transcript page (“Tr.”) 83.\n     3Doc. 162 at Tr. 140.\n2\n\nCase 3:17-cv-00739-TJC-JBT   Document 192   Filed 07/26/18   Page 3 of 70 PageID 10681\nposes no threat to the privacy or safety of any of his fellow students.  Rather, Drew\nAdams is just like every other student at Nease High School, a teenager coming of\nage in a complicated, uncertain and changing world.  When it comes to his use of the\nbathroom, the law requires that he be treated like any other boy.\nThe Court recognizes that some will disagree with this decision, for religious\nand other reasons.  I respect their point of view.  However, as a judge, my job is to\ndetermine what the law requires and apply it faithfully to the facts.  I have done that\nto the best of my ability.\nI. Procedural History\nThrough his next friend and mother, plaintiff Drew Adams, a minor,4 filed suit\nin June 2017 (when he was a rising junior at Nease) under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, alleging\nthat the School District violated his rights under the Equal Protection Clause of the\nFourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, U.S. CONST. amend. XIV,\n§ 2, and Title IX, 20 U.S.C. § 1681, by refusing to let him use the boys’ bathroom at\nschool.  See Doc. 1 (and as amended, Doc. 60).  Soon thereafter, he filed a motion\nfor preliminary injunction seeking to enjoin the School Board (the School District’s\ngoverning body) from continuing its policy during the pendency of the case.  Although\nthe Court denied his motion, it set an expedited schedule so the matter could quickly\n     4Ordinarily, minors’ names are redacted from court files, but Adams elected to\nwaive those privacy protections.  See Doc. 1 at 1, n.1; Doc. 60 at 1, n.1.\n3\n\nCase 3:17-cv-00739-TJC-JBT   Document 192   Filed 07/26/18   Page 4 of 70 PageID 10682\nbe brought to trial.5  See Docs. 50, 57 (Order and hearing transcript).  The Court held\na three day non-jury trial on December 11, 12, and 13, 2017, hearing testimony from\nten witnesses6 and admitting numerous exhibits.7  Two witnesses were unable to\nappear live and the Court agreed to accept their videotaped deposition testimony and\na declaration from one.8  The parties also stipulated to certain facts that are deemed\nadmitted.9    A  month  after  the  trial  (and  while  school  was  out  of  session),  the\n     5Along the way, plaintiff dismissed two school officials he had sued in their official\ncapacities, leaving the School Board of St. Johns County, Florida, as the only\ndefendant.  See Docs. 45, 49, 60.\n     6One of those witnesses was Frank D. Upchurch, III, the long-time School Board\nAttorney who advised the School Board on its Best Practices Guidelines (discussed\nbelow) and who is well familiar with School Board policies and the facts described\nherein.  References to testimony by “the School Board Attorney” are references to Mr.\nUpchurch’s testimony and should not be confused with statements or argument by the\nSchool Board’s outside counsel who have represented it throughout this litigation and\nat trial. \n     7The minutes of the bench trial are of record (Docs. 148, 149, and 150), as are the\nparties’ exhibits (Docs. 151 & 152), and Court exhibits (Doc. 166).  Additional exhibits\ncontaining sensitive medical or personal identifying information were filed under seal\n(Docs. 167, 168, 169, 170, 171).  References to exhibits admitted at trial are denoted\nherein as Pl. Ex. __ (for plaintiff’s exhibit), Def. Ex. __ (for defendant’s exhibit), or Ct.\nEx. __ (for Court exhibits).  The public record includes redacted versions of the trial\ntranscripts (Docs. 160-1, 161, 162) which the Court cites throughout this opinion.  The\nunredacted transcripts are under seal at Docs. 143, 144, 145.  The Court has had no\nneed to cite to the unredacted transcripts in this decision.\n     8See Doc. 166, Ct. Ex. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.  In accepting the video depositions, the Court\nagreed to rule on the numerous objections contained therein.  See Doc. 160-1 at Tr.\n147.  To the extent the Court relies on testimony to which an objection was lodged,\nthe objection is overruled.\n     9  See Doc. 116 at § I (p. 22).\n4\n\nCase 3:17-cv-00739-TJC-JBT   Document 192   Filed 07/26/18   Page 5 of 70 PageID 10683\nundersigned toured Nease High School with the school principal and counsel for both\nsides, visiting every restroom on campus.  Thereafter, the parties submitted proposed\nfindings of fact and conclusions of law and supplemental briefs addressing the School\nBoard’s bathroom policy.  See Docs. 172, 173-1,10 174, 175.  The Court heard closing\narguments on February 16, 2018.  Doc. 184.  While the Court has adopted portions\nof each party’s submission, the Court’s findings of fact and conclusions of law are its\nown.  Several pending motions were carried with the case, and those rulings are\nincorporated herein.\nII. Findings of Fact11 \nA. Defining Transgender/Gender Identity/Sex Assigned at Birth\nAs explained by Dr. Diane Ehrensaft, a developmental and clinical psychologist\nwho studies and specializes in treating transgender children and adolescents, there\nare a number of components that determine a person’s gender:  external genitalia,\ninternal sex organs, chromosomal sex, gonadal sex, fetal hormonal sex, hypothalamic\nsex, pubertal hormonal sex, neurological sex, and gender identity and role.  Doc. 166,\n     10An unredacted version of defendant’s brief is in the record at Doc. 180. \n     11Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 52(a)(1), the Court makes these\nfindings upon evaluation of the evidence, including the stipulations in the parties’ joint\npretrial statement and the testimony and exhibits admitted at trial.  Where the\nevidence to support a relevant finding was in dispute, the Court has weighed the\nevidence on both sides to determine what facts are “more likely true than not.” \nPattern Jury Instructions, Civil Cases, Eleventh Circuit (2013 revision, last revised\nJan. 2018) 1.1 Gen. Prelim. Instr. \n5\n\nCase 3:17-cv-00739-TJC-JBT   Document 192   Filed 07/26/18   Page 6 of 70 PageID 10684\nCt. Ex. 3 at ¶ 20.12  Among these markers, external genitalia, the most physically\nobvious one, has historically been used to determine gender for purposes of recording\na birth as male or female.  Id. at ¶ 19.  In most people, all the markers, including\nexternal genitalia, lead to a singular conclusion that an individual is either a male or\na female.  Doc. 166, Ct. Ex. 3 at ¶ 19.  Sometimes, though, they are not congruent,\nwith some indicators suggesting the individual is female, and others male.13  Id. at ¶\n20.  In this situation, neurological sex and related gender identity are the most\nimportant and determinative factors.  Id.\n     12Defendant filed a Daubert motion to exclude certain testimony of Deanna Adkins,\nM.D. and Diane Ehrensaft, Ph.D.  Doc. 129. To the extent the motion seeks to\nexclude portions of their testimony regarding matters of school policy creation and\nimplementation, or links between the school bathroom policy and Adams’ purported\nemotional distress and damages, the motion is moot because the Court has not relied\non that testimony.  To the extent the motion seeks to exclude portions of their\ntestimony related to understanding the nature of gender, the protocols for addressing\ngender transitioning, and the treatment of gender dysphoria, the motion is denied, the\nCourt finding they are qualified to testify on those matters (and others not challenged\nby this motion), the methodologies upon which they rely for these limited matters are\nsufficiently  reliable,  and  their  testimony  assists  the  Court  in  understanding  the\nevidence.\n     13Because the “physical aspects of maleness and femaleness” may not be in\nalignment (for example, “a person with XY chromosomes [could also] have female-\nappearing genitalia), the Endocrine Society guidelines disfavor the term “biological\nsex.”  Doc. 151, Pl. Ex. 30 at 7.\n6\n\nCase 3:17-cv-00739-TJC-JBT   Document 192   Filed 07/26/18   Page 7 of 70 PageID 10685\nThe Medical Amici14 explain that “‘[g]ender identity’ refers to a person’s internal\nsense  of  being  male,  female,  or  another  gender.”    Doc.  119,  Ex.  A  at  6.    A\ntransgender individual is someone who “‘consistently, persistently, and insistently’\nidentifies as a gender different than the sex they were assigned at birth.”  Id. at 7.  A\n2016 publication estimated that 1.4 million transgender adults are living in the United\nStates, 0.6 percent of the adult population.  Id. at 4.  “Gender identity is distinct from\nand does not predict sexual orientation; transgender people, like cisgender [non-\ntransgender] people, may identify as heterosexual, gay, lesbian, bisexual, or asexual.” \nId. at 4-5.\n“[M]any  transgender  individuals  are  diagnosed  with  gender  dysphoria,  a\ncondition that is characterized by debilitating distress and anxiety resulting from the\nincongruence between an individual’s gender identity and birth-assigned sex.”  Id. at\n7.  Gender dysphoria is recognized by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental\n     14Upon review, and over defendant’s objection (Doc. 118), the motion for leave to\nfile an amicus brief by the American Academy of Nursing, the American Academy of\nPediatrics, the American Association of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry, the American\nCollege of Physicians, the American Medical Association, the American Medical\nWomen’s  Association,  the  Association  of  Medical  School  Pediatric  Department\nChairs, the American Nurses Association, the GLMA-Health Professionals Advancing\nLGBT  Equality,  the  Endocrine  Society  and  the  Pediatric  Endocrine  Society,\n(hereinafter, “the Medical Amici”) (Doc. 119), is granted to the extent that the Court\nwill rely on its brief (Doc. 119, Ex. A) for helpful explanations of biological and medical\nterminology.  Additionally, the position of these medical associations as to the\nappropriate standard of care for gender dysphoria is useful to understanding that\ndiagnosis.  Defendant’s motion to strike their brief (Doc. 118) is denied.\n7\n\nCase 3:17-cv-00739-TJC-JBT   Document 192   Filed 07/26/18   Page 8 of 70 PageID 10686\nDisorders.    Id.  at  8.    According  to  the  Medical  Amici,  the  World  Professional\nAssociation  for  Transgender  Health  (“WPATH”)  has  established  the  accepted\nstandard of care for transgender persons suffering from gender dysphoria, and it\n“includes assessment, counseling, and, as appropriate, social transition, puberty-\nblocking drug treatment, hormone therapy, and surgical interventions to bring the\nbody into alignment with one’s gender identity.”  Id. at 10-11.\nSocial transition “typically includes publicly identifying oneself as that gender;\nadopting a new name; using different pronouns; grooming and dressing in a manner\ntypically associated with one’s gender identity” (Id. at 11); changing sports teams to\nbe consistent with one’s gender identity (Doc. 166, Ct. Ex. 2 at Tr. 23); “and using\nrestrooms and other single-sex facilities consistent with that identity.”  Doc. 119, Ex.\nA at 11.  Transgender students typically seek privacy and discreteness in restroom\nuse and try to avoid exposing any parts of their genitalia that would reveal sex\ncharacteristics inconsistent with their gender identity.  Doc. 166, Ct. Ex. 3 at ¶ 49. \nThe Pediatric Endocrine Society states that not allowing students to use the restroom \nmatching their gender identity promotes further discrimination and segregation of a\ngroup that already faces discrimination and safety concerns.15  Doc. 151, Pl. Ex. 47.\n     15Other evidence further supports the contention that there is a documented history\nof discrimination against transgender individuals.  See, e.g., Doc. 114 (Plaintiff’s\nrequest  for  Judicial  Notice  as  to  governmental  actions,  policies  and  reports\ndocumenting discrimination against transgender people) (the objection to this filing is\noverruled); Doc. 151, Pl. Ex. 66 at iv, v, and 4 (Broward County Public Schools\n8\n\nCase 3:17-cv-00739-TJC-JBT   Document 192   Filed 07/26/18   Page 9 of 70 PageID 10687\nThe Endocrine Society Clinical Practice Guideline considers the standard of\ncare for some adults and adolescents with gender dysphoria or who seek gender\naffirmance to include hormone treatment which, for a transgender male, will alter the\nappearance of the genitals, suppress menstruation, and produce secondary sex\ncharacteristics such as increased muscle mass, increased body hair on the face,\nchest, and abdomen, and a deepening of the voice.  Doc. 151, Pl. Ex. 30 at 18-19. \nSurgical interventions (including a double mastectomy and chest reconstruction for\ntransgender men (sometimes referred to as “top surgery”) and/or genital surgery) may\nbe appropriate and medically necessary for some patients, but may be delayed until\nthe age of legal majority because, unlike the other treatments, they are largely\nirreversible.

The School\nBoard Attorney also testified that in reviewing the literature compiled by the task force\nthat studied the school policies and in conducting other research, transgender\nstudents “are a vulnerable student population” who “fear for their safety,” and “are\nmore prone to be victims of violence, bullying [and] physical [harm] than other\nstudents.”  Doc. 162 at Tr. 120; see also Whitaker v.

Doc. 160-1 at Tr. 84;\nDoc. 161 at Tr. 31.  His Florida birth certificate recorded his sex as “female.”  Doc.\n160-1 at Tr. 83; Doc. 170, Def. Ex. 145 (under seal).  From a young age, Adams’\nparents noticed that Adams rejected what they describe as stereotypically feminine\nbehaviors and attributes, such as playing with dolls, favoring the color pink, or wearing\ndresses; instead, Adams preferred playing with toy race cars and dinosaurs, and\ngoing  to  the  science  center.    Doc.  160-1  at  Tr.  217-18;  Doc.  161  at  Tr.  87. \nNonetheless, Adams was a happy and smart child.  Doc. 160-1 at Tr. 81, 189.  In\nmiddle school, however, as Adams started going through puberty, he “hated” the\ndeveloping feminine parts of his body.   Id. at Tr. 89-91.  Adams began to show signs\nof depression and anxiety and in early 2015, Adams’ parents brought him to a mental\nhealth therapist as well as a psychiatrist.

Under the Best Practices Guidelines, upon\nrequest by a student or parent, students should be addressed with the name and\ngender pronouns corresponding with the student’s consistently asserted gender\n     20Historically, the School District accommodated the occasional student who\nneeded additional privacy because of a physical disability or for other reasons by\nmaking a gender-neutral single-stall bathroom available.

The document further states that “[t]here is no specific federal or\nFlorida state law that requires schools to allow a transgender student access to the\nrestroom corresponding to their consistently asserted transgender identity.”  Id.\nIn formulating their recommendations for the Best Practices Guidelines, the\nLBGTQ task force was aware that some other school districts, including in Florida,\nhave  adopted  policies  permitting  transgender  students  to  use  the  restrooms\nconsistent with their gender identity.  Doc. 161 at Tr. 215-16.  However, the task force\ndid not recommend that alternative for the St. Johns County School District due at\nleast in part to concerns about how to handle gender-fluid students (those whose\ngender changes between male and female) or those pretending to be gender-fluid,\nalthough the task force had not heard of any such incidents.23  Id. at Tr. 215-17.\n     23There is not a scientific or medical definition of “gender-fluid” in the record.  The\nBroward County Public Schools support guide for LGBTQ issues references gender\nfluidity within its definition of “genderqueer,” saying individuals who are genderqueer\n“typically reject notions of static categories of gender and embrace a fluidity of gender\nidentity and often, though not always, sexual orientation.”  Doc. 151, Pl. Ex. 66 at 10. \nThe District of Columbia Public Schools defines gender fluidity as conveying “a wider,\nmore flexible range of gender expression, with interests and behaviors that may\nchange, even from day to day.  Gender fluid children do not feel confined by\nrestrictive boundaries of stereotypical expectations of girls or boys . . . . [A] child may\nfeel they are a girl some days and a boy on others, or a combination, or possibly feel\nthat neither term describes them accurately.”  Doc. 151, Pl. Ex. 116, Pt. 2 at 25.  In\nDoe  v.  Boyertown  Area  School  District  (a  transgender  school  bathroom  case\ndiscussed further below), the court defined “gender fluid” as a person who “identifies\nas male in some situations and female in other situations.”  276 F. Supp. 3d 324, 344\n(E.D. Pa. 2017), aff’d, 890 F.3d 1124 (3d Cir. 2018) (affirming), 893 F.3d 179\n(opinion).  That court also cited an expert (Ohio psychiatrist Dr. Scott Leibowitz) who\nexplained that “‘gender fluid’ is not a clinical term, but it describes kind of feeling a\n17\n\nCase 3:17-cv-00739-TJC-JBT   Document 192   Filed 07/26/18   Page 18 of 70 PageID 10696\nAccording to the School Board Attorney, the gender-neutral bathroom option\nwas added to the Guidelines and is now part of the school policy as a reasonable\nalternative  for  transgender  students  so  they  would  not  be  required  to  use  the\nbathroom of their sex assigned at birth.  Doc. 162 at Tr. 61-62.  The School Board’s\nposition is that this approach reconciles the interests of transgender students without\nviolating the School Board policy of having separate bathrooms for boys and girls.  Id.\nat Tr. 62.  The retired Director of Student Services also explained that the Best\nPractices Guidelines accommodate gender-fluid students while protecting against the\npossibility that students might claim to be gender-fluid to gain access to the bathroom\nof the opposite sex.  Doc. 161 at Tr. 216.\nSeveral months after the School District implemented the Best Practices\nGuidelines, the United States Departments of Education and Justice issued guidance\n(“the 2016 Guidance”) that the term “sex” under Title IX included gender identity. \nDoc. 152, Def. Ex. 84.  The 2016 Guidance directed that schools that provide sex-\nsegregated restrooms, locker rooms and shower facilities must allow transgender\nstudents to use those facilities consistent with their gender identity.

In\nresponse, the School District issued a statement through its Superintendent that it\ncertain gender at a certain moment in time, and . . . then switching, perhaps, back.” \nId. at 365.\n       Adams is not gender-fluid.  Other than discussing defendant’s contentions about\ngender-fluidity, the Court’s opinion does not address how schools should handle this\ncomplicated issue.\n18\n\nCase 3:17-cv-00739-TJC-JBT   Document 192   Filed 07/26/18   Page 19 of 70 PageID 10697\ndisagreed with that guidance and intended to continue following its long-standing\nbathroom policy as supplemented by the Best Practices Guidelines, which it believed\nto be lawful and provided a reasonable accommodation.  Doc. 162 at Tr. 75-78.  In\nFebruary  2017,  the  Departments  of  Education  and  Justice  withdrew  the  2016\nGuidance, explaining that it had not undergone any formal public process and had\nbeen  issued  without  extensive  legal  analysis  or  explanation  as  to  how  it  was\nconsistent with Title IX.  Doc. 152, Def. Ex. 237. \nIncorporating both the long-standing unwritten School Board bathroom policy\nand the Best Practices Guidelines, the current policy in St. Johns County public\nschools for grades four and up is that “biological boys” may only use boys’ restrooms\nor gender-neutral single-stall bathrooms and “biological girls” may only use girls’\nrestrooms or gender-neutral single-stall bathrooms, with the terms “biological boys”\nand “biological girls” being defined by the student’s sex assigned at birth, as reflected\non the student’s enrollment documents.24  Doc. 162 at Tr. 45-46, 62, 71; Doc. 161 at\n     24Although the Best Practices Guidelines supplement the earlier policy by providing\na gender-neutral single-stall bathroom option, the policy that only “biological boys”\nmay use the boys’ restroom and that only “biological girls” may use the girls’ restroom\nis not written anywhere.  The Court had questions about whether it had been adopted\nas the official policy of the School Board, such that the challenge to it created a ripe\ncontroversy requiring decision by a federal court.  At the Court’s direction, the parties\nfiled supplemental briefs on the issue after trial and the School Board Chair affirmed\nthat the School Board policy prohibits Adams from using the boys’ bathrooms at\nNease High School.  See Docs. 159, 172, 174, 178, 184 at Tr. 6-13.  The Court is\nsatisfied that this matter presents a real and substantial controversy that is ripe for\njuridical review.  See Nat’l Adv. Co. v. City of Miami, 402 F.3d 1335, 1338-39 (11th\n19\n\nCase 3:17-cv-00739-TJC-JBT   Document 192   Filed 07/26/18   Page 20 of 70 PageID 10698\nTr. 248.  The School Board Attorney explained that the bathroom policy comports with\nthe Board’s overall responsibility for student welfare, which, in the case of bathrooms,\nprincipally involves concerns for privacy and safety.25  Doc. 162 at Tr. 110-11.\nWith regard to privacy, the School Board seeks to preserve the privacy of\nindividuals using the restroom facilities, but admits that the bathroom stall doors\nprovide privacy for anyone inside a stall.  Id. at Tr. 114.  The retired Director of\nStudent Services who led the LGBTQ task force explained the privacy concerns:\n[W]hen a girl goes into a girls’ restroom, she feels that she has the\nprivacy to change clothes in there, to go to the bathroom, to refresh her\nmakeup.  They talk to other girls.  It’s kind of like a guy on the golf\ncourse; the women talk in the restrooms, you know.  And to have\nsomeone  else  in  there  that  may  or  may  not  make  them  feel\nuncomfortable, I think that’s an issue we have to look at.  It’s not just for\nthe transgender child, but it’s for the other.\n   \nDoc. 161 at Tr. 213.  The School District’s Deputy Superintendent for Operations\nraised similar points, saying a student may want privacy to undress or clean up a stain\non her clothing.  Id. at Tr. 248.  The School Board Attorney also explained that\nallowing a transgender student to use a restroom that conformed to his or her gender\nidentity could create opportunities for students “with untoward intentions to do things\nthey ought not to do,” although the School Board has never received any complaints\nCir. 2005) (explaining the constitutional and prudential concerns that must be satisfied\nto invoke the federal court’s limited jurisdiction). \n     25The School Board did not argue that cost was a factor in arriving at a bathroom\npolicy.  See Doc. 161 at Tr. 67-68.\n20\n\nCase 3:17-cv-00739-TJC-JBT   Document 192   Filed 07/26/18   Page 21 of 70 PageID 10699\nof untoward behavior involving a transgender student.   Doc. 162 at Tr. 112-13.\nAs for the safety aspect, the School Board seeks to assure that members of the\nopposite sex are not in an unsupervised bathroom together, citing as an example the\nrisks of danger posed to a female freshman student who might find herself alone in\nthe restroom with an 18-year old male student.  Id. at Tr. 69, 111, 115.  A related\nconcern raised by the retired Director of Student Services was that under a relaxed\npolicy, a student–a football player for example–could pose as being gender-fluid for\nthe purpose of gaining access to the girls’ restroom, but the school would have no\nway to know whether his belief that he is gender-fluid is sincere.  Doc. 161 at Tr. 213. \nHowever, the task force’s research did not reveal any actual situations where a\nproblem like that occurred.  Id. at Tr. 213.\nThe retired Director of Student Services also expressed concern for the safety\nof transgender students, worrying that they might be bullied or assaulted or ridiculed\nby other students if they are in the bathroom that matches their gender identity.  Id.\nat Tr. 217.  While the School Board’s code of conduct would address any violations,\nby keeping boys and girls separate in the unsupervised restrooms, the School Board\nseeks to minimize the  opportunity for any such violation to occur.  Doc. 162 at Tr.\n115.  However, the School Board is not aware of any bullying violations involving a\ntransgender student in any St. Johns County School District restroom, id. at Tr. 115,\nnor did the task force hear of any such incidents in other school districts involving\n21\n\nCase 3:17-cv-00739-TJC-JBT   Document 192   Filed 07/26/18   Page 22 of 70 PageID 10700\ntransgender students using the restroom that aligned with their gender identity.  Doc.\n161 at Tr. 219-20.  Moreover, the retired Director of Student Services acknowledged\nthat  for  a  transgender  student  who  has  made  the  social  transition  and  whose\nappearance is consistent with his or her gender identity (for example, a transgender\ngirl whose hair is long, whose breasts are enhanced, who is wearing lipstick), there\nmay be safety, security, and privacy concerns if that student used the restroom that\nis consistent with the sex the student was assigned at birth; thus, she thought it would\nbe preferable if such a student used a gender-neutral single-stall bathroom.  Id. at Tr.\n207-09; 217-18.\nAdditionally, if a transgender student enrolled in the St. Johns County School\nDistrict having already changed their legal documents to reflect their gender identity,\nthe student’s school records would reflect that gender as well.   Doc. 162 at Tr. 35. \nThe school district has no process to determine if a student is transgender.  Doc. 161\nat Tr. 235.  As the School Board Attorney said, “[t]he district does not play bathroom\ncop,” and it accepts the information on the enrollment documents at face value.  Doc.\n162 at Tr. 53.  Thus, unless there was a complaint, a transgender student could use\nthe restroom matching his or her gender identity until he or she graduated and the\nschool would be none the wiser.  Id. at Tr. 35-36, 53.  The School Board Attorney\ntestified that he thought that scenario would be a rare occurrence and, if it became a\nproblem, the School Board could re-examine the practice of using self-identifying\n22\n\nCase 3:17-cv-00739-TJC-JBT   Document 192   Filed 07/26/18   Page 23 of 70 PageID 10701\nenrollment documents to determine gender.26  Id. at Tr. 54-55.  However, he agreed\nthat at this point, the School District would have no occasion to question a student\nwho used a restroom consistent with the gender recorded on the student’s enrollment\ndocuments.  Id. at Tr. 89.\nThe Nease campus is spread over several buildings.  There are four sets of\nmulti-stall, sex-segregated bathrooms available during class time to the school’s\n2,450 students.  Id. at Tr. 131-32.  An additional set is available in the locker rooms\nfor  use  by  students  while  taking  physical  education  classes.    Id.  at  Tr.  131. \nDiscounting the locker room, there are a total of ten bathroom stalls available in the\nboys’ restrooms on the Nease campus.  Id. at Tr. 133.  All of the boys’ restrooms have\na set of urinals and stalls with doors.  The urinals in the boys’ restrooms are not\ndivided by partitions, although a school official said perhaps they could be.  Id. at Tr.\n32.  The campus additionally has eleven gender-neutral single-stall bathrooms in\nvarious locations which are open to any student or staff member.  Id. at Tr. 134.  A\nmulti-stall boys’ restroom and a multi-stall girls’ restroom are accessible to students\nin the cafeteria area, but there is not a gender-neutral bathroom in that area and\nduring certain lunch periods, students who wish to use a gender-neutral bathroom\n     26The School Board Attorney did not testify as to what a revised practice might be. \nThe retired Director of Student Services testified it would be “totally inappropriate” to\nconduct physical inspections of students to determine what genitalia they had, and the\nschool would “never” do that.

Doc. 160-1 at Tr. 279-80.\nThe undersigned visited Nease and toured all of the bathrooms on campus. \nWhile they were clean, most of the multi-stall single-sex restroom facilities were dated\nand there were not nearly enough bathrooms for boys or girls considering the number\nof students at Nease.  The school principal said there are often lines to use those\nbathrooms.  The gender-neutral bathrooms were generally more modern than the\nmulti-stall single-sex bathrooms.  Some of Nease’s classrooms are in portable\nbuildings.  There are no gender-neutral bathrooms or faculty bathrooms near those\nclassrooms, and the multi-stall single-sex bathrooms there have very few stalls.  The\nprincipal said that faculty assigned to teach in the portable classrooms sometimes use\nthe multi-stall single-sex bathrooms.  The undersigned observed that the boys’ locker\nroom is an open space with no room for privacy while changing.  There is a bathroom\navailable in the coach’s office, but the principal said it is not available to use for\nchanging.  The boys’ locker room shower is an open space with several shower\nheads and no curtains or dividers.  The showering space is visible to other areas of\nthe locker room.\nD. Adams’ Experience with the Bathroom Policy at Nease High School\nSchool enrollment documents show that Adams enrolled in the St. Johns\nCounty School District as a female entering the fourth grade at PV/PV Rawlings\nElementary in 2010.  See Doc. 170, Def. Ex. 142, 143, 144 (under seal).  During the\n24\n\nCase 3:17-cv-00739-TJC-JBT   Document 192   Filed 07/26/18   Page 25 of 70 PageID 10703\nsummer  of  2015,  before  Adams  began  high  school  at  Nease,  Adams’  mother\ninformed the student services department that Adams was transitioning and would be\nattending high school as a boy.  Doc. 160-1 at Tr. 251-52.  When Adams began\nschool in August, he presented as a boy and used the boys’ restroom when needed\nwithout incident. Id. at Tr. 253.  One day in September approximately six weeks after\nschool started, Adams was called out from his classroom and told by his guidance\ncounselor that someone had complained about him using the boys’ restroom and that,\ngoing forward, he could use the gender-neutral bathroom in the school office.  Id. at\nTr. 114-15, 253.  Adams was also advised that he could use the girls’ restroom,\nsomething he found insulting.  Id. at Tr. 117-18.  It was not a boy or a boy’s parents\nwho had complained.  Rather, it was two unidentified female students who reported\nthat they had seen Adams entering the boys’ restroom.  Doc. 162 at Tr. 16-17.\nTo Adams, the school’s refusal to let him use the boys’ restroom meant that the\nschool did not see him as a boy, and refused to accept who he was.  Doc. 160-1 at\nTr. 116.   As Adams testified, “I was living in every aspect of my life as a boy and now\nthey’re taking that away from me.”  Id.  Adams said he was confused, shocked, and\nangered by the school’s reaction.  Id. at Tr. 115-16. The school agreed to provide\ngender-neutral restrooms which Adams has used as necessary.  Id. at Tr. 172-73. \nAdams would be subject to disciplinary action if he used the boys’ bathroom.  Doc.\n162 at Tr. 17-18.  Over the course of Adams’ freshman and sophomore years, Adams’\n25\n\nCase 3:17-cv-00739-TJC-JBT   Document 192   Filed 07/26/18   Page 26 of 70 PageID 10704\nmother met with various school and District personnel, sent them letters and emails,\nand pursued a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education’s Office of Civil\nRights; by the end of his sophomore year when those efforts had not resulted in any\nchange to the school bathroom policy, Adams, through his mother, filed this lawsuit. \nDoc. 160-1 at Tr. 254-60.\nFor  some  of  Adams’  classes  during  his  junior  year,  the  gender-neutral\nbathrooms were considerably further away than the boys’ restrooms.27  Id. at Tr. 117,\n119, 122-24, 176-79.  Adams monitors his fluid intake to minimize his need to use the\nrestroom and he now uses the school bathroom only once or twice a day.28  Id. at Tr.\n118-19, 172.  Adams thinks ahead about where his classes are and which bathrooms\nhe can access, worrying he will miss valuable class time if a gender-neutral bathroom\nis not nearby.29  Id. at Tr. 118-19.  Adams’ has not registered for any physical\n     27Nease has increased the number of gender-neutral single-stall restrooms\navailable for student use since Adams started as a student there.  Originally, only one\nwas available, in the school office.  By the time Adams finished his junior year in the\nspring of 2018, eleven were available.  Doc. 160-1 at Tr. 120; Doc. 162 at Tr. 133-34.\n     28Pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Adkins testified that limiting fluid intake to avoid\nbathroom use increases the risk of urinary tract infections and dehydration (Doc. 166,\nCt. Ex. 2 at Tr. 32-33), but Adams has never complained to school officials about\nthose issues (Doc. 160-1 at Tr. 179), and there is no evidence in the record of him\nhaving suffered from those problems.  \n     29Having visited the Nease campus and toured the routes Adams took from his\nclasses to the nearest gender-neutral bathroom, the Court did not find those distances\nto be so far as to disrupt Adams’ class schedule.\n26\n\nCase 3:17-cv-00739-TJC-JBT   Document 192   Filed 07/26/18   Page 27 of 70 PageID 10705\neducation  classes  while  at  Nease  (students  enrolled  in  the  International\nBaccalaureate program are not required to take physical education classes), and\nAdams did not testify about the school policy with respect to the locker rooms, which\nare only available to students taking physical education classes.  Doc. 171, Def. Ex.\n42 & 43 (under seal); Doc. 162 at Tr. 131.\nAdams testified that he feels alienated and humiliated, and it causes him\nanxiety and depression to walk past the boys’ restroom on his way to a gender-neutral\nbathroom, knowing every other boy is permitted to use it but him.  Doc. 160-1 at Tr.\n116-17.  Adams thinks it also sends a message to other students who see him use\na “special bathroom” that he is different, when all he wants is to fit in.  Id. at Tr. 205.\nThere were no reported instances of privacy breaches during the time Adams\nused the boys’ restroom at Nease.  Although no one other than the two female\nstudents ever complained about Adams’ use of the boys’ bathroom at Nease, the\nparties stipulated that certain parents and students in the School District object to a\npolicy or practice that would allow students to use bathrooms in accordance with their\ngender identity as opposed to their sex assigned at birth, because they believe such\na practice would violate the bodily privacy rights of students and raises privacy, safety\nand welfare concerns.  Doc. 116 at § I, ¶ 3 (p. 22).  The School District has agreed\nto treat Adams as a boy in all other respects, but its position is that Adams’ enrollment\ndocuments and official school records identify him as a female, and he has not\n27\n\nCase 3:17-cv-00739-TJC-JBT   Document 192   Filed 07/26/18   Page 28 of 70 PageID 10706\npresented any evidence that he is a “biological male.”  Doc. 161 at Tr. 229-36, 253;\nDoc. 162 at Tr. 12-13, 35-36; Doc. 173-1 at ¶¶ 42-43.  The School District maintains\nthat Adams is welcome to use the gender-neutral bathrooms or the girls’ bathroom.30 \nDoc. 161 at Tr. 250-51.  But he cannot use the boys’ bathroom.\nE. Schools With Policies Permitting Transgender Students \nTo Use The Bathroom that Aligns With Their Gender Identity\nThe Court heard testimony from three school administrators familiar with other\nschools  that  have  adopted  the  transgender  bathroom  policy  that  Adams  is\nadvocating.31  Broward County, also in Florida, has a public school policy that permits\nstudents to use gender-neutral restrooms as well as the restrooms that match their\ngender identity.  Doc. 151, Pl. Ex. 66 at 40-41.  Unlike St. Johns County, Broward\nCounty also has a human rights ordinance that prohibits discrimination based on\n     30That latter position seems disingenuous.  Adams presents as a boy and\ncontinues to exhibit more masculine physical features as his medical treatment\ncontinues.  It would seem that permitting him to use the girls’ restroom would be\nunsettling for all the same reasons the School District does not want any other boy in\nthe girls’ restroom.\n     31A group of school administrators, school districts, and educators from 29 states\nand the District of Columbia sought leave to file an amicus brief in support of Adams’\nposition.  Doc. 124.  The School Board objected that their brief was filed just three\nbusiness days before trial, it deprived counsel of an opportunity to cross-examine their\npositions, and would be cumulative of other evidence.  Doc. 136.  Two of the school\nadministrators who testified are among the members who sought to file the brief.  For\nthe reasons raised by the School Board, and finding that the testimony of the three\nadministrators ameliorates any prejudice to Adams, the Court will deny the amicus’\nmotion (Doc. 124) (and finds their counsel’s motion for leave to appear pro hac vice\n(Doc. 125) to therefore be moot).\n28\n\nCase 3:17-cv-00739-TJC-JBT   Document 192   Filed 07/26/18   Page 29 of 70 PageID 10707\ngender identity.  Id. at 16.  Michaelle Valbrun-Pope, the Executive Director of the\nStudent Support Initiatives for Broward County Public Schools (the sixth largest\nschool district in the nation), testified that she is aware of nine other Florida school\ndistricts that have implemented some of their policies with regard to transgender\nstudents.32  Doc. 161 at Tr. 65-66.  Valbrun-Pope testified that Broward County\nSchools’ transgender bathroom policy, which has been in effect for about five years,\nhas not caused any issues related to safety or privacy.  Id. at Tr. 64-65.  She testified\nthat she has never heard of a transgender student exposing himself or herself in the\nrestroom and that doing so would be inconsistent with aligning themselves with their\ngender identity and being accepted as that gender.  Id. at Tr. 65.\nMichelle Kefford, a principal at a high school in Broward County who also works\ndistrict-wide answering questions about the district’s LGBTQ policies, has worked with\nabout a dozen transgender students over the years, and her high school presently\nhas two transgender students out of a population of about 2,600.  Id. at 106, 109-110,\n     32At closing arguments, counsel for the School Board noted a few other counties\nwithin the Middle District whose school boards he believed have policies similar to St.\nJohns County’s, and remarked that the Volusia County School Board was involved\nin similar litigation.  But apparently the Volusia County School Board accepts a birth\ncertificate as proof of “sex” and, as the transgender plaintiff in that case has now\nobtained “an amended State of Florida birth certificate identifying his sex as male,” the\nVolusia County School Board now permits him to use the boys’ restrooms and locker\nrooms at his school.  See Doe v. Volusia Cnty. Sch. Bd., No. 6:18-cv-102-Orl-37GRK,\nDoc. 57 at ¶ 2 (filed June 19, 2018).\n          \n29\n\nCase 3:17-cv-00739-TJC-JBT   Document 192   Filed 07/26/18   Page 30 of 70 PageID 10708\n117.  Once a transgender student comes forward to identify herself or himself, an\nadult staff member meets with the student to discuss a variety of issues, including\nwhether the student wants to be called a different name, whether the student’s family\nis aware of the situation, whether a referral to any outside resources would be helpful\nto the student or the family, whether the student has disclosed his or her gender\nidentity to others, whether the student is engaged in extracurricular activities or sports\nwhere support may be needed, and what restroom the student wants to use.   Id. at\nTr. 111-12; Doc. 151, Pl. Ex. 66 at 49-51.  Broward County Public Schools do not\nrequire any legal documentation such as a birth certificate to permit students to be\ntreated  consistent  with  their  gender  identity,  and  students  need  only  identify\nthemselves as transgender to have access to the restroom that corresponds to the\ngender identity they assert at school.  Doc. 151, Pl. Ex. 66 at 35-36, 40-41.\nKefford  testified  that  no  students  or  parents  have  complained  about\ntransgender  students  in  the  bathrooms,  although  in  the  training  sessions  she\nconducts within the school district, she has encountered other adults who do not\nagree with the district’s transgender policies.  Doc. 161 at Tr. 106, 118-19.  Based on\nher experience in meeting with these adults, Kefford’s opinion is that “people are\nafraid of what they don’t understand . . . [and] a lot of that fear [is because] they\nhaven’t experienced it, they don’t know enough about it, and the first thing that comes\nto mind is this person wants to go into this bathroom for some other purpose. That’s\n30\n\nCase 3:17-cv-00739-TJC-JBT   Document 192   Filed 07/26/18   Page 31 of 70 PageID 10709\nnot the reality.  The reality is this child . . . just want[s] to be accepted” as a member\nof the gender with which they identify.  Id. at Tr. 120-21.\nKefford  also  testified  that  there  has  never  been  a  problem  involving  a\ntransgender student in the bathroom, and any problem that did arise would be dealt\nwith in accordance with the school’s disciplinary guidelines.  Id. at Tr. 106-07.  Kefford\nsaid that any child who was uncomfortable with the policy or wanted additional privacy\nbeyond that already afforded by a bathroom stall would have the option of using a\ngender-neutral single-stall bathroom.  Id. at Tr. 120.  She also testified that some\ntransgender students who are in the early stages of their transition prefer to use a\ngender-neutral bathroom instead of the bathroom that matches their gender identity. \nId. at Tr. 111-12.  Kefford has never heard of a transgender student (or adult) going\ninto a restroom for the purpose of engaging in any inappropriate predatory behavior\nand has never heard of a cisgender student pretending to be transgender to gain\naccess to a bathroom opposite of their true gender identity.  Id. at Tr. 107, 119.\nDr. Thomas Aberli, a principal with the Jefferson County Public Schools in\nKentucky testified about his experience at a high school during the time that it\nadopted a policy to permit transgender students to use bathrooms and locker rooms\nthat aligned with their gender identity.   Doc. 160-1 at Tr.  22-23.  That high school\ndoes not have any gender-neutral bathrooms but does have one single-stall girls’\nbathroom and one single-stall boys’ bathroom in the front office.

Id. at Tr. 26-27.  \nAberli explained that this was his first encounter with a transgender student and he\nhad a steep learning curve but ultimately concluded that “being transgender was a\nreal thing that the school would have to respond to.”  Id. at Tr. 31.  Although many\nparents initially had concerns about safety and privacy, the school has disciplinary\nprocedures to address any violations, and none have occurred.  Id. at Tr. 45-54.\nIII. Conclusions of Law\nTo prevail, Adams must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the\nSchool Board violated his rights under the Equal Protection Clause and/or Title IX.33 \nIf Adams does so, it is also his burden to prove (again by a preponderance of the\nevidence) how this violation caused him damage.34  See Pattern Jury Instructions,\n     33Adams filed suit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.  The School Board is a “person” acting\nunder color of law within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. § 1983.  Doc. 151, Pl. Ex. 138 at\nRequest for Admission 1.\n     34The evidence at trial was that Adams has no occasion to use the locker room at\nNease (the use of which is limited to students taking physical education classes,\nwhich he does not) and none of his testimony related to those facilities or any desire\nto access them.  Likewise, when discussing the School Board’s concerns, the\ntestimony was about the multi-stall single-sex restrooms on campus that students use\nduring class time, on the short breaks between classes, or during lunch.  While the\nCourt viewed the locker room and showers as part of its tour of Nease, Adams did not\nattempt to show that the School Board policy as it relates to locker rooms and shower\nfacilities has caused him any harm.  Thus, the Court’s analysis of Adams’ claims does\nnot include consideration of his use of the boys’ locker room or shower facilities and\nthe Court’s rulings do not apply to those spaces.  Outside of case citations, references\n32\n\nCase 3:17-cv-00739-TJC-JBT   Document 192   Filed 07/26/18   Page 33 of 70 PageID 10711\nCivil Cases, Eleventh Circuit (2013 revision, last revised Jan. 2018) 1.1 Gen.

Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 253 (1981) (explaining\nthat even in burden shifting cases, plaintiff bears the ultimate burden of persuading\nthe trier of fact).\nThe Supreme Court has long recognized that the state has broad authority to\nprotect the physical, mental, and moral well-being of its youth.  Planned Parenthood\nof Cent. Mo. v. Danforth, 428 U.S. 52, 72-74 (1976).  The Court is mindful that\nschools are traditionally locally controlled and that a federal court should tread lightly\nwhen asked to contravene a policy established by a local school board.  Minor\nchildren are involved here and the concerns of their parents and school administrators\ncharged with their safety cannot be minimized.  Moreover, of all the areas in a school,\nbathrooms are where privacy considerations are at their peak.  So, even if a school\nis otherwise prepared to accept a student as transgender, it is not surprising that\nallowing transgender students to use restrooms aligned with their gender identity is\nnot an easy step.  But neither was it easy when public restrooms were racially\nintegrated.  To be sure, what the law requires and what some are comfortable with\nare not always the same.  Nonetheless,  “[a]n individual can invoke a right to\nconstitutional protection when he or she is harmed, even if the broader public\nto “restrooms” or “bathrooms” within this section of the opinion do not include those\nlocated in the locker room or shower facilities.  \n33\n\nCase 3:17-cv-00739-TJC-JBT   Document 192   Filed 07/26/18   Page 34 of 70 PageID 10712\ndisagrees and even if the legislature refuses to act.”   Obergefell v. Hodges, 135 S.\nCt. 2584, 2605 (2015).\nA. Equal Protection Clause Claim\nThe Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment provides that no\nState may “deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.” \nU.S. Const. amend. XIV, § 1.   Accordingly, the St. Johns County School Board, a\npolitical subdivision of the State of Florida,35 must “treat all persons similarly situated\nalike or, conversely, [must] avoid all classifications that are ‘arbitrary or irrational’ and\nthose that reflect ‘a bare desire to harm a politically unpopular group.’” Glenn v.\nBrumby, 663 F.3d 1312, 1315 (11th Cir. 2011) (quoting City of Cleburne v. Cleburne\nLiving Ctr., Inc., 473 U.S. 432, 446-47 (1985)).  Generally, state action will be upheld\n“if it is rationally related to a legitimate governmental purpose.”  Id.

Glenn, 663 F.3d at 1316, n.4 (citing Clark v.\nJeter, 486 U.S. 456, 461 (1988)).  The “heightened” scrutiny test applied in Whitaker\nis the same as the “intermediate” scrutiny test applied in Glenn.  Though Adams\nargued that strict scrutiny might apply here, the Court is not aware of any transgender\nbathroom case that has applied strict scrutiny, reserved for “classifications pertaining\nto race or national origin or to those affecting certain fundamental rights.” Id.

But Adams identifies as a boy, is\nidentified by others as a boy, is legally deemed by the state of Florida to be a boy,\nlives as a boy, uses the men’s restroom outside of the school setting, and is otherwise\ntreated as a boy--except when it comes to his use of the school bathrooms.  The\nSchool Board Attorney agreed that as a transgender boy, Adams is not treated the\nsame as “biological boys” when it comes to using the restroom.  Doc. 162 at Tr. 118. \nThus, although the policy treats most boys and girls the same, it treats Adams\ndifferently because, as a transgender boy, he does not act in conformity with the sex-\nbased stereotypes associated with the sex he was assigned at birth (female).  “This\npolicy is inherently based upon a sex-classification and heightened review applies.” \nWhitaker, 858 F.3d at 1051 (explaining that school bathroom policy which relied on\nsex listed on students’ birth certificates did not treat all boys and girls the same (and\ntherefore violated the Equal Protection Clause) because transgender students, who\nfail to conform to sex-based stereotypes associated with their sex assigned at birth,\nare treated differently).  As the Eleventh Circuit explained in Glenn, “[a]ll persons,\nwhether transgender or not, are protected from discrimination on the basis of gender\nstereotype,” which includes “perceived gender-nonconformity,” “a form of sex-based\ndiscrimination that is subject to heightened scrutiny under the Equal Protection\nClause.”  663 F.3d at 1318-19.

Here, by contrast, defendant agrees that its\nbathroom policy makes distinctions based on sex and is subject to intermediate\nscrutiny.  Doc. 173-1 (Defendant’s proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law)\nat 37.  Although the School Board did not have transgender students in mind when\nit originally established separate multi-stall restrooms for boys and girls, it has since\nbecome aware of the need to treat transgender students the same as other students\nand does so in all other respects, except when it comes to the bathroom policy: A\nstudent whose sex assigned at birth is female is subject to discipline if the student\nidentifies as a male and uses the boys’ restroom, whereas the same student would\nbe free to use the boys’ restroom if his sex assigned at birth was male or if he agreed\nto act in conformity with the School Board’s expectations and use the girls’ restroom. \nThus, even if it started out that way, the school bathroom policy is no longer a neutral\nrule because it applies differently to transgender students, as the School Board itself\nacknowledges.  See Romer v. Evans, 517 U.S. 620, 634 (1996) (noting that class\nseparation raises an “inevitable inference” of animosity toward the affected class);\nDoe 1 v. Trump, 275 F.

The School Board’s positions here echo\nthose pled in A.H. and, to the extent it’s necessary, the Court finds Adams has made\nthe threshold showing of intentional discrimination. \n37\n\nCase 3:17-cv-00739-TJC-JBT   Document 192   Filed 07/26/18   Page 38 of 70 PageID 10716\nis the standard the Court will apply.38\nUnder the intermediate scrutiny standard, the School Board must show that “‘its\ngender classification is substantially related to a sufficiently important government\ninterest.’”  Glenn, 663 F.3d at 1316 (quoting Cleburne, 473 U.S. at 441).  The\njustification for its policy must be “exceedingly persuasive.”  United States v.

See, e.g., Grimm v. Gloucester Cty. Sch. Bd., 302 F. Supp. 3d 730, 749-50 (E.D.\nVa. 2018) (concluding transgender individuals are a quasi-suspect class) M.A.B., 286\nF.

Morales-Santana, 137 S. Ct. 1678, 2690 (2017) (internal\nquotation and alterations omitted, emphasis in original) (citation omitted).  The School\nBoard contends its bathroom policy is substantially related to its important interests\nin  student  privacy  and  student  safety,  both  of  which  fall  within  its  statutory\nresponsibility for student welfare.\n1. Privacy\nThe School Board claims that its long-standing policy of having separate boys’\nand girls’ bathrooms has created an expectation of privacy for students and parents\nwho do not expect students of the opposite sex to share the bathroom space.  Doc.\n162 at Tr. 67.  The Court agrees that the School Board has a legitimate interest in\nprotecting student privacy, which extends to bathrooms.  But allowing transgender\nstudents to use the restrooms that match their gender identity does not affect the\nprivacy protections already in place.  When he goes into a restroom, Adams enters\na stall, closes the door, relieves himself, comes out of the stall, washes his hands,\nand leaves.  Adams has encountered no problems using men’s restrooms in public\nplaces, and there were no reports of problems from any boys or boys’ parents during\nthe six weeks of his freshman year when Adams used the boys’ restrooms at Nease. \nNor was there any evidence that any school official associated with the St. Johns\nCounty School District, including members of its LGBTQ task force, had ever heard\nof any incident anywhere where a transgender student using a restroom acted in a\n39\n\nCase 3:17-cv-00739-TJC-JBT   Document 192   Filed 07/26/18   Page 40 of 70 PageID 10718\nmanner that invaded another student’s privacy.\nLikewise, the research and experience of the school officials from Broward\nCounty  and  Jefferson  County  Public  Schools  in  Kentucky  revealed  no  privacy\nconcerns when transgender students used the restroom that matched their gender\nidentity.  While St. Johns County School personnel said girls may want privacy in the\nrestrooms while talking to their peers, changing clothes (which can be done in a stall),\nputting on make-up, or removing stains from their clothing, none of that requires them\nto expose their anatomy to other students such that having a transgender student in\nthe  restroom  would  invade  their  bodily  privacy.    And,  any  student  who  wants\nadditional privacy for any reason is permitted to use the gender-neutral single-stall\nbathrooms.\nAdmittedly, the boys’ restrooms at Nease– which Adams would use if he could– \nhave urinals without dividers, so if someone chose to be a voyeur, there is the\npotential that a boy’s genitals could be viewed.  But this is not a real concern for\nseveral reasons.  First, Adams cannot use a urinal and always uses a stall.  Second,\nthere is no evidence that a transgender boy is more likely to be curious about another\nstudent’s anatomy than any other boy.  Third, any student engaging in voyeurism in\nthe bathroom would be engaging in misconduct which is subject to discipline through\nthe School District’s code of conduct.  Fourth, any boy who is concerned about other\nstudents seeing his anatomy can use a gender-neutral bathroom or a stall in the boys’\n40\n\nCase 3:17-cv-00739-TJC-JBT   Document 192   Filed 07/26/18   Page 41 of 70 PageID 10719\nrestroom (as Adams would when using the boys’ restroom).\nNor  was  there  any  evidence  that  transgender  students  might  expose\nthemselves to other students in the restroom; in fact, the evidence was to the\ncontrary– transgender students want to be discrete about their anatomy so other\nstudents do not recognize them as anything but the gender with which they identify. \nIndeed, as the School Board admitted, there could be transgender students whose\nenrollment documents are consistent with the students’ gender identity, and no one\nwould know they are using restrooms that are different from the ones that match their\nsex assigned at birth.\nBased on the evidence at trial, the Court concludes that the School District’s\nbathroom policy “does nothing to protect the privacy rights of each individual student\nvis-a-vis students who share similar anatomy and it ignores the practical reality of how\n[Adams], as a transgender boy, uses the bathroom:  by entering a stall and closing\nthe door.”  Whitaker, 858 F.3d at 1052; see also Boyertown, 893 F.3d at 193\n(rejecting cisgender students’ argument that transgender students in school locker\nrooms and multi-stall restrooms violated their constitutional right to privacy, noting\n“appellants are claiming a very broad right of personal privacy in a space that is, by\ndefinition and common usage, just not that private”).  Thus, when the School District’s\nstated privacy interest is “weighed against the facts of the case and not just examined\nin the abstract,”  Whitaker, 858 F.3d at 1052, it fails to provide an “exceedingly\n41\n\nCase 3:17-cv-00739-TJC-JBT   Document 192   Filed 07/26/18   Page 42 of 70 PageID 10720\npersuasive justification” for the School Board’s bathroom policy.39  Virginia, 518 U.S.\nat 556.  See also Grimm, 302 F. Supp. 3d at 751 (finding School Board’s privacy\nargument “[rang] hollow” and was based on conjecture given that the only complaints\ncame from adults, not students (who had shared a restroom with the transgender\nstudent for weeks) and because a “‘transgender student’s presence in a restroom\nprovides no more of a risk to other students’ privacy rights than the presence of an\noverly curious student of the same biological sex’”) (quoting Whitaker, 858 F.3d at\n1052); Evancho 237 F. Supp. 3d at 289-90 (acknowledging school’s obligation to\nprotect student privacy but finding “facts on the ground” revealed school bathroom\nlayout (composed of stalls with locking doors and partitioned urinals) did not pose any\n     39The School Board also relied on the privacy rights accorded under the Florida\nConstitution (Article I, Section 23), but did not explain how those rights would be\ninfringed by the presence of a transgender student in a restroom conforming to his or\nher gender identity, nor why those rights should be given more weight than the Equal\nProtection rights at stake.  Moreover, the School Board Attorney acknowledged that\nthe Broward County School District (also in Florida) was not violating any Florida law\nby following its policy, which permits transgender students to use the restroom that\naccords with their gender identity.  See Doc. 162 at Tr. 122-23.  For the same reasons\ncited above, the privacy rights guaranteed under the Florida Constitution are not\nendangered when transgender students use multi-stall school restrooms that match\ntheir  gender  identity,  particularly  where  all  students  have  the  option  to  avail\nthemselves of the privacy afforded by the multi-stall and gender-neutral single-stall\nbathrooms.  The persuasiveness of the cases relied on in the above analysis is not\ndiminished merely because their states do not have a constitutional right of privacy\nsimilar to Florida’s.  Nor is their analysis less persuasive because a state law may\nhave prohibited discrimination on the basis of gender identity.\n42\n\nCase 3:17-cv-00739-TJC-JBT   Document 192   Filed 07/26/18   Page 43 of 70 PageID 10721\nactual risk of invasion of a student’s personal privacy).40\n2.  Safety\nThe School Board also cites student safety as a basis to uphold its bathroom\npolicy, expressing concern for transgender students who may be bullied or harassed\nin the bathroom matching their gender identity and for cisgender students who may\nnot feel safe if a person with genitalia of the opposite sex is in the restroom with them. \nThere was no evidence that Adams encountered any safety concerns during the six\nweeks he used the boys’ restroom at Nease or when he does so in other public\nplaces.  Likewise, there was no evidence that Adams presents any safety risk to other\nstudents or that transgender students are more likely than anyone else to assault or\nmolest another student in the bathroom.  Any incidents of misconduct are subject to\nthe school’s code of conduct and, if necessary, Florida criminal law.\nNone of the school officials who testified had ever heard of an incident where\nstudent safety was compromised by the presence of a transgender student in the\nrestroom that matched his or her gender identity.  Again, any student with safety\nconcerns–including a transgender student–can use a gender-neutral single-stall\nbathroom.  Consistent with a number of other courts that have considered the issue,\n     40The School Board relies on numerous cases for the general proposition that\nstudents have an interest in protecting their bodily privacy (see Doc. 173-1 at 37-40). \nThe Court does not disagree, but the evidence at trial established that student privacy\nwill not be infringed by permitting Adams to use the boys’ restrooms.\n43\n\nCase 3:17-cv-00739-TJC-JBT   Document 192   Filed 07/26/18   Page 44 of 70 PageID 10722\nthis  Court  finds  concern  for  student  safety  is  not  an  “exceedingly  persuasive\njustification” for upholding the school bathroom policy.  Virginia, 518 U.S. at 556; see,\ne.g., Evancho, 237 F. Supp. 3d at 291 (finding safety concerns were unfounded given\navailability of disciplinary code and lack of record of any threat that a student would\npose as transgender to gain access to a restroom); Highland, 208 F. Supp. 3d at 876-\n77 (finding testimony from other districts showed parents’ safety concerns to be\n“wholly unfounded in practice” and noting that any worry about sexual activity in the\nbathrooms was “logical[ly] flaw[ed]” given that gay males were not excluded from\nboys’ restrooms and gay females were not excluded from girls’ restrooms).\n3. Additional Considerations\nAlthough the Court has found that the School Board’s concerns about privacy\nand safety are only conjectural (and therefore insufficient to survive intermediate\nscrutiny), the School District says it creates policy with an eye toward minimizing the\nrisk of future problems, even if none have ever occurred.  With that in mind, the Court\nhas carefully considered whether the eleven gender-neutral single-stall bathrooms on\ncampus (which are open to all students) provide an appropriate accommodation for\nAdams such that more is not required.  They do not.  While there are more stalls\navailable in gender-neutral bathrooms (eleven) than in the multi-stall boys’ restrooms\n(ten), some of them are further away from Adams’ classes.  More importantly,\nhowever, Adams testified to the stigma that attaches to his use of gender-neutral\n44\n\nCase 3:17-cv-00739-TJC-JBT   Document 192   Filed 07/26/18   Page 45 of 70 PageID 10723\nbathrooms, especially when he has to walk right past an available boys’ restroom to\nfind one.  See Doc. 160-1 at Tr. 204 (describing the walk from his class to a gender-\nneutral single-stall bathroom as “feel[ing] almost like a walk of shame”).\nHe also testified about the message it sends to other students that the school\ndoes not view him as a real boy.  Using his words:  “[B]ecause I’m using a special\nbathroom and I’m oftentimes passing a men’s bathroom, everybody knows I’m\ndifferent, and I just want to fit in.  So it’s the opposite of what I want.”  Id. at Tr. 205. \nIn Boyertown, the Third Circuit rejected the suggestion from cisgender students that\nthe school should offer transgender students the opportunity to use gender-neutral\nsingle-stall facilities, finding that policy “invite[s] more scrutiny and attention” from the\ntransgender students’ peers, “very publicly brand[ing] all transgender students with\na scarlet “T” [which] they should not have to endure . . . as the price of attending their\npublic school.”  893 F.3d at 192 (quoting Whitaker, 858 F.3d at 1045).41  The Court\n     41Though not raised here, the court in M.A.B. rejected the argument that the use\nof a gender-neutral single-stall bathroom would cause cisgender students the same\nhumiliation and embarrassment experienced by transgender students, finding, among\nother reasons, that requiring the transgender students to use that restroom was\nentirely different from providing cisgender students the option of using it if they wanted\ngreater privacy.  286 F. Supp. 3d at 724-25.  The court in Grimm adopted M.A.B.’s\nreasoning, finding an important difference between a boy who uses a gender-neutral\nsingle-stall bathroom because he has been singled out for differing treatment by the\nschool because he is transgender and fails to conform to sex-based stereotypes, and\na boy making a personal choice to change clothes in or use a single-stall restroom.\n302 F. Supp. 3d at 752.  While the St. Johns County School Board does not actually\nrequire Adams to use the gender-neutral single-stall bathrooms, in reality he is not\nwelcome to use the girls’ restrooms (and he does not) so his use of the gender-\n45\n\nCase 3:17-cv-00739-TJC-JBT   Document 192   Filed 07/26/18   Page 46 of 70 PageID 10724\nfinds  the  placement  of  the  numerous  gender-neutral  single-stall  bathrooms  on\ncampus, while useful and well-intentioned, does not remedy the Equal Protection\nviolation.\nThe retired Director of Student Services testified that the task force was\nconcerned about what to do about “gender-fluid” students if the School District strayed\nfrom its long-standing policy of only permitting “biological boys” to use the boys’\nrestroom and only permitting “biological girls” to use the girls’ restroom.  The general\npoint is well-taken, but merely hypothetical given where we are.  This case does not\nraise the issue of what to do about gender-fluid students; rather, the question here is\nwhether to permit a transgender boy who has taken significant social, medical and\nlegal measures to present as a boy (and who never intends to use a girls’ restroom)\nto have access to the boys’ restroom.  Thus, to the extent school officials are worried\nthat gender-fluid students might be using a boys’ restroom one day and a girls’\nrestroom the next, that would not happen if relief is granted here because this case\nis only about permitting one transgender boy to use the boys’ restroom.42  For this\nneutral single-stall bathrooms is not the same “option” provided to cisgender students.\n     42There was no evidence that any St. Johns County gender-fluid students have\ncome forward requesting access to any particular restroom. The Court notes that the\nBroward County School District’s LGBTQ guidelines(touted by Adams as an example\nworth following) do not include any specific restroom accommodation for gender-fluid\nstudents.  Doc. 151, Pl. Ex. 66.  See also  Boyertown, 276 F. Supp. 3d at 344 (noting\nthat the school district was not aware of any gender-fluid students enrolled at the high\nschool, and did not yet have a plan to consider how to accommodate them).\n46\n\nCase 3:17-cv-00739-TJC-JBT   Document 192   Filed 07/26/18   Page 47 of 70 PageID 10725\nsame reason, the hypothetical worry that cisgender students might pose as gender-\nfluid for the purpose of gaining access to the restroom of the opposite sex is not a\nvalid concern here.43  This case is not about eliminating separate sex bathrooms; it\nis only about whether to allow a transgender boy to use the boys’ bathroom.\nThe Court likewise rejects the contention that permitting Adams to use the boys’\nrestroom is just the beginning of a “slippery slope” which will result in the elimination\nof separate sex restrooms.  As explained by the Medical Amici, a transgender\nindividual “‘consistently, persistently, and insistently’ identifies as a gender different\nthan the sex they were assigned at birth.”  Doc. 119, Ex. A at 7.  Transgender\nindividuals are not gender-fluid and their sense of who they are is settled.  Adams\ndoes not want to use the girls’ restroom.  The undisputed evidence is that he is a\ntransgender boy and wants to use the boys’ restroom.  There is no evidence to\nsuggest that his identity as a boy is any less consistent, persistent and insistent than\nany other boy.  Permitting him to use the boys’ restroom will not integrate the\nrestrooms between the sexes.\nEven so, the School Board contends that its policy is simply based on the\nrealistic physical differences between the sexes.  The School Board cites Michael M.\nv. Superior Court of Sonoma County, 450 U.S. 464 (1981), in which a plurality of the\n     43There was no evidence of a student having ever posed as being gender-fluid at\nany school to gain entry to the bathroom of the opposite gender.  Any such behavior\ncould be addressed through disciplinary means.\n47\n\nCase 3:17-cv-00739-TJC-JBT   Document 192   Filed 07/26/18   Page 48 of 70 PageID 10726\nSupreme Court noted that it “has consistently upheld statutes where the gender\nclassification is not invidious, but rather realistically reflects the fact that the sexes are\nnot similarly situated in certain circumstances.”  Id. at 469.  The statute in Michael M.\n(which criminally punished males for engaging in sexual intercourse with females\nunder the age of eighteen to whom they are not married, but did not similarly punish\nfemales) was based on the physiological fact that women can get pregnant and men\ncannot.  Id.  at 469, 471.  As the plurality opinion explained, California sought to\nprevent illegitimate teenage pregnancies (the harmful consequences of which fall\ndisproportionately on the teenage female and often result in costs to the state when\nunwanted illegitimate children become its wards) by deterring men from having sex\nwith underage women to whom they are not married.  Id. at 470-73.  The Court\nagreed with California that having a gender-neutral statute would frustrate its effective\nenforcement because women would not report the crime if they, too, would be\nprosecuted.  Id. at 473-74.\nThe bathroom policy here is distinguishable–everyone is subject to the same\nrule–both boys and girls must use the bathroom that aligns with their sex assigned at\nbirth (or a gender-neutral one), and both boys and girls would be subject to discipline\nfor disobeying the policy.  The school bathroom policy does not depend on something\ninnately different between the bodies of boys and girls or what they do in the\nbathroom.  Michael M., by contrast, “upheld . . . the gender classification” because the\n48\n\nCase 3:17-cv-00739-TJC-JBT   Document 192   Filed 07/26/18   Page 49 of 70 PageID 10727\nstatute there aimed to prevent teen pregnancy and “realistically reflect[ed] the fact that\nthe sexes were not similarly situated” because only women could become pregnant. \nId. at 469.  Nguyen v. I.N.S., 533 U.S. 53 (2001) is distinguishable for the same\nreason.  533 U.S. at 59-64 (upholding statute that set different requirements for\nproving parenthood for men and for women because giving birth is inherent proof of\nmotherhood).   No such difference is relevant here.44  Rather, it is his failure to act in\nconformity with his sex assigned at birth that is causing the School District to treat\nAdams differently.  See Glenn, 663 F.3d at 1316 (holding in transgender employment\ncase that “discriminating against someone on the basis of his or her gender non-\nconformity constitutes sex-based discrimination under the Equal Protection Clause”).\nThe School Board also relies on Johnston v. University of Pittsburgh, 97 F.\nSupp. 3d 657 (W.D. Pa. 2015), one of a minority of cases to reject an Equal\nProtection claim by a transgender student regarding bathroom use, and Carcano v.\nMcCrory, 203 F. Supp. 3d 615 (M.D. N.C. 2016), which likewise rejected an Equal\nProtection challenge brought by transgender students and an employee of a state\n     44As further support for their position that separating boys and girls based on\n“biological sex” is permissible, the School Board also points to language in the\nSupreme Court’s Virginia decision, which recognized that [p]hysical differences\nbetween men and women . . .  are enduring” and “the two sexes are not fungible.” \nSee Doc. 173-1 at  35, 38 (quoting Virginia, 518 U.S. at 533).  But here, as in Virginia,\nthose differences are not relevant to the question before the Court.  See Virginia. 518\nU.S. at 519 (holding the Constitution’s equal protection guarantee required Virginia\nMilitary Institute (which had been a male-only institution) to admit female cadets).\n49\n\nCase 3:17-cv-00739-TJC-JBT   Document 192   Filed 07/26/18   Page 50 of 70 PageID 10728\nuniversity subject to North Carolina’s “bathroom bill.”  But Johnston and Carcano are\ndistinguishable.  Their construction of the meanings of and relationship between the\nterms “sex” and “gender” are out of step with the Equal Protection analysis in Glenn\n(an Eleventh Circuit decision), the weight of other decisions which have construed\nthose terms in this context, and with the medical community whose opinions were\nadmitted in this case.45  According to Glenn, “[a] person is defined as transgender\nprecisely because of the perception that his or her behavior transgresses gender\nstereotypes.  The very acts that define transgender people as transgender are those\nthat contradict stereotypes of gender-appropriate appearance and behavior.”  663\nF.3d at 1316 (quotation and citations omitted).  Thus, “discrimination against a\ntransgender individual because of her gender-nonconformity is sex discrimination,\nwhether it’s described as being on the basis of sex or gender.”  Id. at 1317.\n     45Johnston recognized that “the legal landscape is transforming as it relates to\ngender identity, sexual orientation, and similar issues” and that other courts had\ndeclined to adopt the definitions articulated in the thirty year old Seventh Circuit case\nupon which it relied, but determined that without Supreme Court or Third Circuit\nprecedent, it would follow that earlier decision.  See Johnston, 97 F. Supp. at 668,\n671, n.14 (citing Ulane v. E. Airlines, Inc., 742 F.2d 1081, 1085 (7th Cir. 1984)).  Both\nthe Seventh Circuit and the Eleventh Circuit have found Ulane’s analysis no longer\ntenable following the Supreme Court’s decision in Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, 490\nU.S. 228 (1989), which held that Title VII’s reference to “sex” encompasses both\nbiological differences and gender discrimination.  See Whitaker, 858 F.3d at 1047;\nGlenn, 663 F.3d at 1318, n.5.  Moreover, the Third Circuit’s Boyertown decision is\nprecedent that would likely affect the outcome if Johnston were decided today.  See\nBoyertown, 893 F.3d at 183-84 (providing definitions of “sex,” “gender,” “social gender\ntransition” and related terms based on testimony of expert in gender dysphoria and\ngender-identity issues).\n50\n\nCase 3:17-cv-00739-TJC-JBT   Document 192   Filed 07/26/18   Page 51 of 70 PageID 10729\nThough  not  an  Equal  Protection  Clause  case,  the  Third  Circuit’s  recent\nBoyertown decision (which rejected claims by cisgender students that transgender\nstudents in the restrooms violated Title IX and Pennsylvania privacy law), likely\neviscerates any persuasive value Johnston retained.  Boyertown, 893 F.3d 179. \nLikewise, the Equal Protection analysis in Carcano (which cites Nguyen and other\nauthorities which permitted different treatment based on meaningful differences in\nphysiology, 203 F. Supp. 3d at 642-45) is not persuasive in light of Glenn, the other\nauthorities that have considered this issue, and the evidence in this case (which\nreveals that the multi-stall school bathrooms at Nease have individual stalls with doors\nthat afford privacy and that all students have access to gender-neutral single-stall\nbathrooms for those who want additional privacy).46\nAlthough there was no testimony on the issue, the parties stipulated that some\nparents and students in the St. Johns County School District object to a policy\npermitting transgender students to use a restroom matching their gender identity,\nbelieving the policy “would violate the bodily privacy rights of students and raise[s]\nconcerns for their privacy, safety and welfare.”  Doc. 116 at § I (p. 22).   There are\ncases where parents have removed their children from public school and/or have\nsued a school district over a transgender bathroom policy.  See, e.g., Boyertown, 893\n     46The privacy interests in Carcano were also implicated by shower and locker room\nfacilities which are not at issue in this case.   Carcano, 203 F. Supp. 3d at 642.\n51\n\nCase 3:17-cv-00739-TJC-JBT   Document 192   Filed 07/26/18   Page 52 of 70 PageID 10730\nF.3d 179 (suit filed by cisgender students objecting to the presence of transgender\nstudents in the school restrooms and locker rooms); Evancho, 237 F. Supp. 3d at\n291-92 (noting that some parents had or intended to withdraw their children from\nschool over transgender bathroom policy).\nBut the Court has addressed why privacy and safety concerns, though perhaps\nunderstandable,  simply  aren’t  realized  when  transgender  students  use  school\nbathrooms aligned with their gender identity.  See Doc. 161 at Tr. 64-65, 106-07\n(testimony of Broward County school officials); see also Whitaker, 858 F.3d at 1052;\nBoyertown, 893 F.3d at 193.  Moreover, while the Court finds that the gender-neutral\nbathrooms are not an adequate remedy for the breach of Adams’ rights, they remain\nan alternative for any cisgender student who is uncomfortable sharing a restroom with\nAdams.  Thus, while the School Board must take into account the concerns of\ncisgender students and their parents, it may not do so at the expense of Adams’ right\nto equal protection under the law.  “If adopting and implementing a school policy or\npractice based on [the] individual determinations or preferences of parents–no matter\nhow sincerely held–runs counter to the legal obligations of the [School] District, then\nthe District’s and the Board’s legal obligations must prevail.” Evancho, 237 F. Supp.\n3d at 292.47\n     47The School Board also contends that its policy cannot be held to violate the\nEqual Protection Clause when they are merely following distinctions between the\nsexes permitted by Title IX and its implementing regulations. As further discussed\n52\n\nCase 3:17-cv-00739-TJC-JBT   Document 192   Filed 07/26/18   Page 53 of 70 PageID 10731\nThe School Board has not shown that ‘its gender classification is substantially\nrelated to a sufficiently important government interest,’” Glenn, 663 F.3d at 1316\n(quotation  omitted),  let  alone  that  the  justification  for  its  policy  is  “exceedingly\npersuasive.”  Virginia, 518 U.S. at 556.  Nor has it shown a “foundation for the\nconclusion that allowing [Adams to use the boys’ restroom] will cause the harmful\noutcomes they describe.”  Obergefell, 135 S. Ct. at 2607.  Adams has therefore\nproven that the School Board has violated his rights under the Equal Protection\nClause through its enforcement of the school bathroom policy.\nB. Title IX\nAdams also claims that the School Board bathroom policy violates his rights\nunder Title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972.  Under Title IX, no person\n“shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits\nof, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving\nFederal financial assistance . . . .”  20 U.S.C. § 1681(a).  The statute’s implementing\nregulations provide that a covered institution cannot provide different aid, benefits, or\nservices; cannot deny aid, benefits, or services; and cannot subject any person to\nseparate or different rules, sanctions, or treatment, “on the basis of sex.”  See 34\nC.F.R. § 106.31(b)(2)-(4); Whitaker, 858 F. 3d at 1046-47.  However, a covered\nbelow, the Court finds this argument unavailing.\n53\n\nCase 3:17-cv-00739-TJC-JBT   Document 192   Filed 07/26/18   Page 54 of 70 PageID 10732\ninstitution “may provide separate toilet, locker room, and shower facilities on the basis\nof sex, but such facilities provided for students of one sex shall be comparable to such\nfacilities provided for students of the other sex.”  34 C.F.R. § 106.33.\nTo prove his claim here, Adams must demonstrate that (1) he was subjected\nto discrimination in an educational program or activity; (2) the discrimination was “on\nthe  basis  of  sex;”  (3)  the  School  Board  receives  federal  funding;  and  (4)  the\ndiscrimination caused him harm.  See Seamons v. Snow, 84 F.3d 1226, 1232 (10th\nCir. 1996); Highland, 208 F. Supp. 3d at 865.  The St. Johns County School Board\nreceives federal financial assistance and is subject to Title IX.  Doc. 116 at § I, ¶ 2;\nDoc. 151, Pl. Ex. 138 at Request for Admission # 3 & 4.  The School Board does not\ncontest that the use of the school restrooms is an “education program or activity”\nwithin the meaning of Title IX.  See Highland, 208 F. Supp. 3d at 865 (“Access to the\nbathroom is . . . an education program or activity under Title IX.”).  The Court’s\nconsideration in the Equal Protection analysis of harm to Adams caused by the\nSchool Board policy excluding Adams from the boys’ restrooms applies here too. \nThus, as in a number of other cases where transgender students have raised Title IX\nchallenges to their school’s bathroom policies, the issue here is whether the bathroom\npolicy which excludes Adams from the boys’ restroom based on his transgender\nstatus is discrimination “on the basis of sex” as used in Title IX and its implementing\nregulations.\n54\n\nCase 3:17-cv-00739-TJC-JBT   Document 192   Filed 07/26/18   Page 55 of 70 PageID 10733\nTitle IX does not define the term “sex,” nor do its regulations.  There is no\nEleventh Circuit or Supreme Court authority directly on point.  Adams argues the term\n“sex” includes gender identity, whereas the School Board contends the term “sex”\nmeans “biological sex.”  Given the lack of definition within the statute or regulation,\nand recognizing that a number of courts have struggled with this exact question, this\nCourt finds the term “sex” as used in Title IX is ambiguous as applied to transgender\nstudents.  Cf. Robinson v. Shell Oil Co., 519 U.S. 337, 340 (1997) (Thomas, J., for the\nunanimous court) (explaining that statutory interpretation is unnecessary “if the\nlanguage at issue has a plain and unambiguous meaning with regard to the particular\ndispute in the case”) (emphasis supplied). \nThe School Board raises four main arguments in support of its interpretation: \nfirst, the meaning of the word “sex” as based on dictionary definitions at the time Title\nIX was enacted and its legislative history support a conclusion that “sex” means\n“biological sex;” second, Title IX permits schools to provide separate boys’ and girls’\nbathrooms so it cannot be a violation to separate the sexes in the restrooms; third, the\nDepartment of Education’s current interpretation of Title IX refutes the argument that\n“sex” includes “gender identity;” and fourth, court decisions that have utilized Title VII\nprinciples to glean a definition of sex (cases upon which plaintiff relies for his\n55\n\nCase 3:17-cv-00739-TJC-JBT   Document 192   Filed 07/26/18   Page 56 of 70 PageID 10734\ninterpretation) are inapplicable.48\nCiting Judge Niemeyer’s dissent from the affirmance of entry of a preliminary\ninjunction in G.G. v. Gloucester County School Board, 822 F.3d 709, 736 (4th Cir.\n2016), vacated and remanded, 137 S. Ct. 1239 (2017), the School Board contends\nthat contemporaneous dictionary definitions of the word “sex” at the time Congress\npassed Title IX reveal it was “universally understood as referring to the biological or\nphysiological characteristics that constitute a person’s sex, and not an internal\nidentification with one gender or the other.”  Doc. 173-1 at 27.  However, the majority\nin G.G. did not find the meaning to be so universally clear, noting, for example, that\na 1970 dictionary defined “sex” as “the character of being either male or female.” \nG.G., 822 F.3d at 721 (quoting the American College Dictionary 1109 (1970)); see\nalso Highland, 208 F. Supp. 3d at 866 (considering the parties’ debate about the\ndictionary definition of “sex” at the time Title IX was enacted, stating “dictionaries from\nthat era defined ‘sex’ in myriad ways” and did not reflect “a uniform and unambiguous\nmeaning of ‘sex’ as biological sex or sex assigned at birth”); Students and Parents for\nPrivacy v. United States, No. 16-cv-4945, 2016 WL 6134121, at *17-18 (N.D. Ill. Oct.\n     48The first three of these arguments were initially raised in the School Board’s\nmotion to dismiss (Doc. 54, adopted as to the amended complaint by notice, Doc. 64). \nThe Court carried the motion with the case, determining that the evidence at trial on\nthe Equal Protection claim would essentially be the same regardless of whether the\nTitle IX claim remained, and that it would be preferable to decide the motion on a full\nrecord.  For the reasons stated here, the motion is denied. \n56\n\nCase 3:17-cv-00739-TJC-JBT   Document 192   Filed 07/26/18   Page 57 of 70 PageID 10735\n18, 2016) (finding dictionary definitions of “sex” included room for “gender identity”). \nThe Court does not find the plain meaning of the word “sex” as used in Title IX to be\napparent from contemporaneous dictionary definitions.\nNor is the Court persuaded that the legislative history relied on by the School\nBoard provides a definitive answer, as it merely emphasized that Title IX was not\nintended to integrate the sexes (something no one is advocating here).  See Doc.\n173-1 at 28-29 (relying on statements of Title IX’s sponsor, Senator Birch Bayh). \nSubsequent uses of the terms “gender” and “gender identity” in other statutes likewise\nfail to convince the Court that the omission of those terms in Title IX was intentional. \nThe presumption that terms are used consistently by Congress is “entitled to less\nforce where, as here, the [School Board] points to terms used in different statutes\npassed by different Congresses in different decades.”  Zarda v. Altitude Express, Inc.,\n883 F.3d 100, 129 (2d Cir. 2018); see also Jackson v. Birmingham Bd. of Educ., 544\nU.S. 167, 174-75 (2005) (holding that Title IX’s use of broad term “discrimination”\nincluded retaliation, notwithstanding that Title VII showed Congress’ ability to provide\nexpress prohibitions against specific kinds of discrimination, including retaliation); \nRobinson, 519 U.S. at 340-44 (holding that Title VII’s use of the term “employee”\nincluded “former employee” even though later statutes specifically used “former\nemployee” when describing category of persons covered by term “employee”); United\nStates v. Wise, 370 U.S. 405, 414 (1962) (finding subsequent Congress’ interpretation\n57\n\nCase 3:17-cv-00739-TJC-JBT   Document 192   Filed 07/26/18   Page 58 of 70 PageID 10736\nof term used in earlier-enacted statute was not relevant in construing term’s meaning);\nWhitaker,  858  F.3d  at  1049  (rejecting  argument  that  Congress’  failure  to  add\ntransgender status as a protected characteristic to Title IX signaled an intentional\nomission).  As the Supreme Court has explained, “[c]ongressional inaction lacks\npersuasive significance because several equally tenable inferences may be drawn\nfrom  such  inaction,  including  the  inference  that  the  existing  legislation  already\nincorporated the offered change.”  Pension Benefit Guar. Corp. v. LTV Corp., 496\nU.S. 633, 650 (1990) (quotation and citation omitted). \nThe School Board also argues that because Title IX explicitly allows “separate\nliving facilities for the different sexes,” 20 U.S.C. § 1686, and its implementing\nregulations permit schools to provide “separate toilet, locker room, and shower\nfacilities on the basis of sex,” 34 C.F.R. § 106.33, it cannot be a violation of the statute\nto provide school restrooms which are separated based on “biological sex.”  The\nCourt is unpersuaded.  Because neither Title IX nor the regulation define “sex” or “on\nthe basis of sex,” the statute and regulation cannot be presumed to mean “biological\nsex.”49  Adams is not contending that the school cannot provide separate restrooms\nfor the sexes–he just wants the school to recognize that, interpreting sex to include\n     49The FHSAA (which governs competitive interscholastic sports at Florida high\nschools (including Nease) and allows students to play on teams based on their\ngender identity) apparently finds Title IX’s use of the word “sex” includes “gender\nidentity.”  See 34 C.F.R. § 106.41(b) (Title IX regulation governing athletics, stating\nthat schools may operate “separate teams for members of each sex”). \n58\n\nCase 3:17-cv-00739-TJC-JBT   Document 192   Filed 07/26/18   Page 59 of 70 PageID 10737\ngender identity, he is a boy and should be permitted to use the boys’ restrooms.50 \nIn 2017, the Department of Education withdrew earlier guidance which had\ninstructed that the term “sex” under Title IX included gender identity and that schools\nmust allow transgender students to use sex-segregated restrooms, locker rooms and\nshower facilities consistent with their gender identity.  Doc. 152, Def. Ex. 84, 237.  The\nSchool  Board  contends  that  the  withdrawal  of  that  guidance  signifies  that  the\nDepartment of Education disagrees with an interpretation of “sex” that includes\ngender identity for purposes of Title IX.  But the 2017 Guidance stated it was\nwithdrawing the earlier guidance because it had not undergone any formal public\nprocess and had been issued without extensive legal analysis or explanation as to\nhow it was consistent with Title IX.  Doc. 152, Def. Ex. 237.  Thus, the rescission of\nthe old guidance without issuing new guidance does not provide any interpretation of\nTitle IX from the Department of Education.  See A.H., 290 F. Supp. 3d at 326-27\n(rejecting contention that withdrawal of previous guidance meant that school could\n     50The School Board argues that a finding that its policy violates the Equal\nProtection Clause renders Title IX unconstitutional.  But even if the Court agreed with\nthe School Board that “sex” as used in Title IX meant “biological sex” (using the term\nas the School Board defines it), Title IX does not mandate separate facilities, so a\ncontrary Equal Protection ruling would not affect its constitutionality.  See Fitzgerald\nv. Barnstable Sch. Comm., 555 U.S. 246, 259 (2009) (“Title IX exempts from its\nrestrictions several activities that may be challenged on constitutional grounds;” some\nof which “may form the basis of equal protection claims.”) (citations omitted); see also\nBoyertown, 893 F.3d at 195 (noting that “Title IX does not require [schools to] provide\nseparate privacy facilities for the sexes”).\n59\n\nCase 3:17-cv-00739-TJC-JBT   Document 192   Filed 07/26/18   Page 60 of 70 PageID 10738\nrely on Title IX to prohibit transgender students from accessing bathrooms consistent\nwith their gender identity). But see Evancho, 237 F. Supp. 3d at 297-301 (finding the\nuncertain legal landscape created by the 2017 withdrawal of the 2016 Guidance,\ncoupled with the Supreme Court’s decision to stay its consideration of the Fourth\nCircuit’s  G.G.  decision  in  light  of  that  withdrawal,51  meant  plaintiffs  could  not\ndemonstrate a likelihood of success on their Title IX claim at that time to support entry\nof a preliminary injunction (which the court nevertheless granted on their Equal\nProtection claim)).\nIt is true, as the School Board notes, that some of the transgender school\nbathroom decisions which considered Title IX relied on the now rescinded guidance\nin reaching a result.  See, e.g., G.G., 822 F.3d at 721 (applying Auer52 deference to\nagencies’ interpretation of ambiguous term “sex” to find transgender student alleged\nviolation of Title IX), vacated and remanded, 853 F.3d 729 (4th Cir. 2017); Highland,\n208 F.

Hopkins, 490 U.S. 228 (1989), which held in\na Title VII case that discrimination on the basis of gender stereotype is sex-based\ndiscrimination.  The  transgender  school  bathroom  cases  also  look  to  Price\nWaterhouse’s progeny, including the Eleventh Circuit’s Glenn decision which, though\nan Equal Protection case, turned to Title VII precedent for guidance and stands as\nauthority for the proposition that “discrimination against a transgender individual\nbecause of [ ] gender-nonconformity is sex discrimination, whether it’s described as\nbeing  on  the  basis  of  sex  or  gender.”53    Glenn,  663  F.3d  at  1317;  see,  e.g.,\nBoyertown, 893 F.3d at 199 (“We are not alone in reaching th[e] conclusion” that “Title\n     53The Court rejects the School Board’s crimped interpretation of Glenn, which it\nattempts to distinguish by claiming that, unlike Glenn, the School Board does not\nengage in gender or sex stereotyping when it excludes Adams from the boys’\nbathroom.  As explained in Glenn, “[a] person is defined as transgender precisely\nbecause of the perception that his or her behavior transgresses gender stereotypes. \nThe very acts that define transgender people as transgender are those that contradict\nstereotypes of gender-appropriate appearance and behavior.”  663 F.3d at 1316\n(quotation and citations omitted).  This is borne out by the facts of this case.  Adams’\ndesire to use the boys’ bathroom stems from his gender identity, which is not in\naccordance with the sex he was assigned at birth.  The School Board policy that\nexcludes Adams is based on its belief that he is not acting in conformity with the sex\nhe was assigned at birth.\n62\n\nCase 3:17-cv-00739-TJC-JBT   Document 192   Filed 07/26/18   Page 63 of 70 PageID 10741\nIX prohibits discrimination against transgender students in school facilities just as Title\nVII prohibit[s] discrimination [against a gender non-conforming employee in the\nworkplace]”) (citing, inter alia, Glenn and Whitaker); Whitaker, 858 F.3d at 1048 (citing\nGlenn as support for the proposition that “[b]y definition, a transgender individual does\nnot conform to the sex-based stereotypes of the sex that he or she was assigned at\nbirth”; thus, when a person is punished for their gender non-conformity by refusing\nthem use of a bathroom that accords with their gender identity, Title IX is violated);\nGrimm, 302 F.

Sundowner\nOffshore Servs., Inc., 523 U.S. 75, 79 (1998) (Scalia, J., for the unanimous court)\n(holding Title VII covered same-sex harassment, explaining “statutory prohibitions\noften go beyond the principal evil to cover reasonably comparable evils, and it is\nultimately  the  provisions  of  our  laws  rather  than  the  principal  concerns  of  our\nlegislators by which we are governed”).  The Attorney General’s October 4, 2017\nMemorandum does not persuade the Court to change course.\n65\n\nCase 3:17-cv-00739-TJC-JBT   Document 192   Filed 07/26/18   Page 66 of 70 PageID 10744\npolicy, practice, or custom of the St. Johns County School District that denies\ntransgender students access to and use of restrooms that match a student’s gender\nidentity.”56  Doc. 175 at 50.\nThe evidence has established that Drew Adams is a transgender boy.  Adams\nhas undergone social, medical, and legal transitions to present himself as a boy. \nAdams wears his hair short; he dresses like a boy; his voice is deeper than a girl’s;\nhis family, peers, classmates and teachers use male pronouns to refer to him; he\ntakes hormones which suppress menstruation and make his body more masculine,\nincluding the development of facial hair and typical male muscle development; he has\nhad a double mastectomy so his body looks more like a boy; the state of Florida has\nprovided him with a birth certificate and driver’s license which state he is a male; and\nwhen out in public, Adams uses the men’s restroom.  As a transgender boy, Adams\nmust be permitted to use the boys’ restroom at school.\nHowever,  the  Court  has  had  no  occasion  in  the  context  of  this  case  to\ndetermine what threshold of transition, if any, is necessary for the School Board to\naccommodate other transgender students, nor did the parties ask the Court to do so. \nThe Court received no evidence concerning any other transgender student.  Thus, the\n     56While his amended complaint sought access to “multi-user facilities” (Doc. 60 at\n21-22), there was no testimony or argument at trial about locker rooms or showers,\nand the Court’s ruling does not address access to those spaces.\n66\n\nCase 3:17-cv-00739-TJC-JBT   Document 192   Filed 07/26/18   Page 67 of 70 PageID 10745\ninjunction that will enter in this case will be limited to the plaintiff, Drew Adams.57\n“[D]amages for emotional distress or mental anguish are at best difficult to\nmeasure.”  Benton v. Rousseau, 940 F. Supp. 2d 1370, 1379 (M.D. Fla. 2013)\n(quotation and citation omitted).  The School Board argued that Adams is in therapy\nonly as needed, he is not taking medications for anxiety or depression, and he\nsuffered from pre-existing medical conditions, so it is hard to say that not using the\nboys’ restroom is really the cause of his distress.  See, e.g., Doc. 160-1 at Tr. 90, 131,\n188.  The Court also finds that Nease faculty and staff have operated in good faith\nand  tried  to  accommodate  Adams’  situation,  lessening  the  emotional  trauma. \nNevertheless, while there was no expert testimony about a diagnosis of gender\ndysphoria for Adams, the Court is persuaded by the evidence that he suffered\n     57Of course, nothing prevents the School Board from using this decision as\nguidance for future situations involving other transgender students.  Notably, for some\ntransgender students, the policy the school currently has may be sufficient, as the\nevidence revealed that not every transgender student is prepared to use the restroom\ncorresponding to their gender identity.  Boyertown may be instructive.  Permission for\ntransgender students to use gender-specific facilities consistent with their gender\nidentity at Boyertown Area Senior High School is granted on a case-by-case basis\nonly after a student meets with trained and licensed counselors, and other school\nadministrators as needed.  Once a transgender student is granted permission to use\nthe facilities matching his or her gender identity, that student is no longer permitted\nto use the facilities corresponding to his or her sex assigned at birth.  893 F.3d at 185. \nSee also Doc. 151, Pl. Ex. 68 (FHSAA) at § 4.3.2 (listing documentation needed for\na student athlete to participate on a team consistent with his or her gender identity,\nincluding a statement from the student, other individuals such as parents, teachers,\nor friends, and a health care professional, affirming the student’s consistent gender\nidentity and expression). \n67\n\nCase 3:17-cv-00739-TJC-JBT   Document 192   Filed 07/26/18   Page 68 of 70 PageID 10746\nemotional damage, stigmatization and shame from not being permitted to use the\nboys’ restroom at school.  See Sheely v. MRI Radiology Network, P.A., 505 F.3d\n1173, 1199 (11th Cir. 2007) (“As a matter of both common sense and case law,\nemotional  distress  is  a  predictable,  and  thus  forseeable,  consequence  of\ndiscrimination.”); “Humiliation and insult are recognized, recoverable harms, and a\nplaintiff’s own testimony of embarrassment and humiliation can be sufficient to\nsupport an award for compensatory damages.”  Bogle v. McClure, 332 F.3d 1347,\n1359 (11th Cir. 2003) (quotation and citation omitted) (upholding awards of punitive\nand compensatory damages in § 1983  race discrimination case); see also Goodin v.\nBank of Amer., N.A., 114 F. Supp. 3d 1197, 1213 (M.D. Fla. 2015) (awarding\nemotional distress damages based on plaintiffs’ testimony, even though they did not\nseek medical attention and no expert or doctor testified);   Adams proposes $25,000\nbut that seems too high.  After all, as Adams himself has argued (through counsel),\nthe point of this case is not money.  Based on the evidence, the Court will award\nAdams $1,000.00 in compensatory emotional distress damages.58\n     58This $1,000.00 award will compensate Adams for his injuries arising out of the\nviolations of the Equal Protection Clause and Title IX (the injuries from which are\nidentical).  See Fitzgerald, 555 U.S. at 254-55 (explaining that damages may be\nawarded for violations of both the Equal Protection Clause and Title IX).  Adams is not\nentitled to double recovery so the total damages award remains $1,000.00. \n68\n\nCase 3:17-cv-00739-TJC-JBT   Document 192   Filed 07/26/18   Page 69 of 70 PageID 10747\nIV. Conclusion\nThere is no doubt that the teachers and administrators of Nease High School\nand the St. Johns County School District are caring professionals who have the best\ninterests of their students at heart.  Likewise, Drew Adams presented himself as a\npolite, forthright individual who is, without rancor, seeking to vindicate his civil rights. \nThe lawyers for both sides have also conducted themselves professionally.  All\ninvolved are to be commended for the way they have handled a difficult and sensitive\nsituation.\nAccordingly, it is hereby\nORDERED:\n1. By separate entry, the Court will enter Final Judgment, finding in favor\nof plaintiff, Drew Adams, a minor, by and through his next friend and mother, Erica\nAdams Kasper, and against the defendant, St. Johns County School Board, on\nCounts I (Equal Protection Clause) and II (Title IX) of Adams’ Amended Complaint\n(Doc. 60).  The Court’s Final Judgment will incorporate an injunction preventing the\nSt. Johns County School Board from enforcing its policy which prohibits Drew Adams\nfrom  using  the  boys’  restrooms  at  Nease  High  School;59  and  a  compensatory\ndamages award of $1,000.00.\n     59For the reasons previously stated, the injunction will not apply to locker rooms\nand showers.\n69\n\nCase 3:17-cv-00739-TJC-JBT   Document 192   Filed 07/26/18   Page 70 of 70 PageID 10748\n2. The Court will retain jurisdiction to enforce the injunction and to address\nthe matter of attorney’s fees and costs.  \n3. No later than September 4, 2018, plaintiff shall file his motion for\nattorney’s fees and costs under 42 U.S.C. § 1988.  No later than October 1, 2018, the\nSchool Board shall respond.  Any motion for bill of costs should follow this briefing\nschedule.\nDONE AND ORDERED at Jacksonville, Florida this 26th day of July, 2018.\ns.\nCopies: \ncounsel of record\n70",

See \n  infra at 1321–27. \n \n6  It is unfortunate that the dissent appears to liken Mr. Adams’s use of the boys’ bathroom as somehow comparable \n  to people who “commit tax fraud, evade the draft, and report inaccurate information on the census,” Dissenting Op. \nat 1323—in short, those who lie, deceive, and demonstrate “evasion.” Id. Mr. Adams has been nothing but honest. \nMr. Adams says he is a boy, and he has the legal documentation to support it. He has plainly and forthrightly \nself-reported. Even if one does not take Mr. Adams at his word, surely one must defer to the status given him by the \nstate of Florida. \nIn response, the dissent goes so far as to say that Mr. Adams’s government-issued documents provide “inaccurate \ninformation.” Id. at 1324. The dissent again ignores that the School District’s policy itself accepts and relies on \ngovernment-issued documentation provided at the time of enrollment. Meanwhile, the dissent argues without any \napparent trace of irony that a system of “self-reporting” and relying on “supporting legal documentation” should be \n25 \n \n\nAdams v.

Id. at 1322–23, 1325. \nIn other words, the dissent appears to say both that government-issued documents are “inaccurate” while saying \nelsewhere that “legal documentation” is “accurate.” We submit that the contradictory positions taken by the dissent \nare reflective of the policy’s arbitrariness. \n \n7  We also pause to correct the record on another distortion by the dissent. The dissent says the School District bases \n  its  bathroom  assignments  on  “a  pre-enrollment  physical  examination  performed  by  the  student’s  doctor.” \nDissenting Op. at 1322. There are at least two things wrong with the dissent’s assertion. First, there is no record \nsupport for the dissent’s apparent assumption that Mr. Adams—or any student in the School District—is required to \nprovide a medical report of a physical examination. The dissent relies on Florida Statute § 1003.22(1), but that \nstatute merely requires that “each child ... present a certification of a school-entry health examination performed \nwithin 1 year before enrollment in school.” (Emphasis added). Here, the record shows that the School District \nmerely tells enrolling students to comply with Florida law’s requirement to undergo a “health examination” and \nself-report their sex by writing it into a box on the enrollment health form. The record shows nothing more. Instead, \nthe evidence shows that self-reporting of medical information is all that is required. As the School District’s lawyer \nwho advised it on its bathroom policy testified, “As a statutory condition of enrollment, a student is required to have \na physical conducted by a doctor. So that report is part of the enrollment package.” R. Doc. 162 at 50 (emphasis \nadded); see also R. Doc. 192 at 4 n.6 (identifying Frank D. Upchurch as a long-time School Board attorney who \nadvised the Board on its “Best Practices Guidelines” and “who is well familiar with School Board policies”). The \n“report” the School Board’s lawyer spoke of is a self-provided account of the student’s medical history, which, when \nit comes to sex, requires only that a student self-report that information. See R. Doc. 162 at 50 (Upchurch testifying: \n“There is a -- two boxes on that -- sort of the cover sheet of the form. And it says M/F. And the student checks -- the \nstudent’s parent checks one.”). The dissent can point to no evidence saying otherwise. \nSecond, there is no record support for the dissent’s apparent assumption that the School District actually bases its \nbathroom assignments on a health examination, as opposed to the self-reporting of the student’s sex in the \nenrollment documents. The record merely shows that the School District’s lawyer “speculated” that students could \nhave had a physical, but he never said the School Board enforces its bathroom policy using information from a \nphysical. In any event, we cannot discern from this record how the dissent got the idea that a certification of a \nroutine “health examination,” which is all that is required under Florida law, requires that a doctor examine, much \nless report to a school about, a child’s genitalia. \nWe think the School District’s “health exam form speaks for itself, and contains no indicator” for a doctor’s \nexamination; “it simply includes a blank box for the child’s sex.” It is undisputed that the School District does not \ninspect students’ anatomy before they use District bathrooms. The School District relies solely on the information \nprovided by the students to enforce its bathroom policy, and the dissent has not pointed to any evidence to the \ncontrary. Rather than accept the record, the dissent continues to push its reimagining of the facts, which even the \nSchool District did not advance. See Oral Arg. Recording at 5:43–6:22 (Dec. 5, 2019) (Chief Judge Pryor: “I thought \nthat there was also a state-mandated physical examination for enrolling students. Is that not true? And that that \nwould also be evaluated as part of the policy?” School District: “Your Honor, I’m not certain on that point. I’m not \ncertain if that was part of the record or not.” Chief Judge Pryor: “At trial Frank Upchurch testified, I thought, in \naddition to the birth certificates, that the School Board also uses the state-mandated physical examination. You \ndon’t recall that?” School District: “No, Your Honor, I don’t recall that.”). \n \n8  The School Board confirmed that the policy separates students solely on the basis of information provided at the \n  time of their enrollment. One discussion between the District Court and Terry Harmon, counsel for the School \nBoard, is particularly instructive: \n26 \n \n\nAdams v. School Board of St. Johns County, Florida, 3 F.4th 1299 (2021)   \n \nDistrict Court: “I thought that when [previous witnesses] were asked what the reason for the policy was, I \nthought they cited things like safety, privacy.” \nCounsel: “The unwritten policy ... has to do with a boy and what bathroom a boy can use and a girl and what \nbathroom a girl can use.” \nDistrict Court: “[I]f you’re saying the whole policy is boys have to use the boys’ restroom and girls have to use \nthe girls’ restroom, the St. Johns County School Board has to be making a value judgment, based on something, \nthat Drew Adams is a girl, because otherwise they’d let him use the boys’ bathroom, right?” \nCounsel: “Yeah, and the value judgment comes in the form of the enrollment materials, which is, what are you \nwhen you enroll in the school district?” \nDistrict Court: “All right. Well, let’s talk about that. ... What happens if the person’s already transitioned before \nthey come to your school and so the paperwork says boy? ... I think [a School Board witness] said, ‘Well, then \nwe would treat him like a boy until we had reason not to,’ or something like that.” \nCounsel: “Yeah. That’s correct.” \nDistrict Court: “But I’m not exactly sure what that means. So if the value judgment is made at the time of the \nenrollment -- and what is it based on? It’s based on --” \nCounsel: “The enrollment material.” \nR. Doc. 198 at 5, 82–83 (quotation marks omitted). \n \n9  The dissent agrees that intermediate scrutiny applies if a policy treats people differently on the basis of sex. \n  Dissenting Op. at 1325. To the extent the dissent now claims that rational basis review applies because “the mere \nact of determining an individual’s sex, using the same rubric for both sexes, does not treat anyone differently on the \nbasis of sex,” id., the dissent misunderstands the policy, which does more than “determine” an individual’s sex. It \nassigns students to bathrooms on the basis of sex using the information provided at the time of enrollment. \nIntermediate scrutiny undoubtedly applies in this case. Neither party has said otherwise. As the School Board said, \n“Here, intermediate scrutiny applies.” Appellant’s Brief at 21; see also Oral Arg. Recording at 3:25–3:56 (Dec. 5, \n2019) (Chief Judge Pryor: “Segregating the bathrooms on the basis of sex is a sex-based classification, right?” School \nDistrict: “Sure. Sure, it is.” Chief Judge Pryor: “So the question is, ... can that classification survive, for the \nconstitutional claim, can it survive intermediate scrutiny, right?” School District: “Correct, Your Honor.”). Nor did the \nprevious dissenting opinion ever raise the possibility of applying rational basis review, even though our previous \nmajority opinion stated exactly the same rationale in determining the bathroom policy arbitrary. Compare Previous \nMajority Op. at 1309–11, with Previous Dissenting Op. at 1324 (applying intermediate scrutiny). \nIn any event, the dissent cannot now claim on the one hand that the majority’s holding on the School Board’s policy \nsomehow decides the constitutionality of sex-segregated bathrooms (which this appeal does not), while also \nasserting that we should be applying rational basis review. The dissent cannot have it both ways. See Dissenting Op. \nat 1325. \n \n10  The dissent defends its reliance on its 99.96 percent figure by pointing to instances where the Supreme Court \n  recounted statistics outside of the context of an Equal Protection analysis. These cases are inapposite.  See \nDissenting Op. at 1324 (citing Birchfield v. North Dakota, 579 U.S. ––––, 136 S. Ct. 2160, 2193 n.10, 195 L.Ed.2d 560 \n(2016) (Sotomayor, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (writing in a Fourth Amendment case); Cent. R.R. Co. \nof Pa. v. Pennsylvania, 370 U.S. 607, 610 n.2, 82 S. Ct. 1297, 1301 n.2, 8 L.Ed.2d 720 (1962) (recounting the number \n27 \n \n\nAdams v.

No one \nis saying members of the judiciary are unable to do simple math. But the Supreme Court has time and again warned \nagainst using arithmetic to supply pat resolutions to sex discrimination cases. \n \n11  The dissent appears to overlook the fact that the District Court’s damages award was based on its review of the full \n  record developed at trial, which includes recognition of Mr. Adams’s social, medical, and legal transition. See \nDissenting Op. at 1325. \n \n12  The evidence at trial also showed that the School District expected this outcome. The School District official who \n  developed the bathroom policy testified that she would prefer a transgender student to use the gender-neutral \nsingle-stall facilities instead of the restroom of his sex assigned at birth. This employee also acknowledged that a \ntransgender student who, like Mr. Adams, presents as a boy, could face “safety, security, and privacy concerns” \nwhile using the restroom of his sex assigned at birth. \n \n \n \n \nEnd of Document   \n \n \n \n \n28 \n ",

A member of our sister circuit \npowerfully described the connection between the harm  57 F.4th 791 \nAdams experienced and the harm other children suffered   \nin the not-so-distant past: \nFootnotes \n \n1  LGBTQ is an acronym for the phrase “lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and questioning (and/or queer).” \n \n \n2  Specifically, the revised opinion eschewed addressing Title IX. And, instead, the revised opinion sua sponte framed \n  Adams’s Equal Protection Clause claim as a challenge to the School Board’s enrollment documents policy—i.e., the \nmeans by which the School Board determines biological sex upon a student’s entrance into the School District—and \nnot as a challenge to the School Board’s bathroom policy—i.e., the policy separating the male and female \nbathrooms by biological sex instead of transgender status or gender identity. But this case has never been about the \nenrollment documents policy. \nThis was not the challenge advanced by Adams in the district court. Indeed, Adams centered the district court \nlitigation on the bathroom policy. For example, in Adams’s amended complaint, Adams sought relief for “his \nexclusion” and denial of “equal access to the boys’ restroom.” Adams specifically challenged “[the School Board’s] \npolicy of excluding transgender students from the single-sex facilities that match their gender identity.” Then, in \nthe joint pretrial statement, Adams sought to recover damages for the harm Adams suffered “as a result of [the \n45 \n \n\nAdams by and through Kasper v. School Board of St. Johns County, 57 F.4th 791 (2022)   \n \n \nSchool Board’s] implementation of its discriminatory restroom policy.” In Adams’s proposed findings of fact and \nconclusions of law, Adams defined the School Board’s purported discriminatory bathroom policy as “[the School \nBoard’s] policy, custom, or usage, as these terms are used in 42 U.S.C. § 1983, barring transgender students from \nthe restrooms consistent with their gender identity.” And because Adams claimed that the policy “treated \n[Adams] differently (i) from other boys, who can use restrooms that match their male gender identity; and (ii) \nfrom non-transgender students, since the policy in effect relegates him to a gender neutral restroom,” Adams \nsought to have the district court enjoin the School Board from enforcing a policy “that denies transgender \nstudents access to and use of restrooms that match a student’s gender identity.” \nUltimately, Adams maintained, until this en banc proceeding after two prior opinions had been vacated, that this \nlawsuit was about allowing transgender students to access bathroom facilities that match their gender identities, \nnot revising the means by which the School Board determines biological sex. While Adams now tries to raise a \nnew claim that the enrollment documents policy violates the Equal Protection Clause because it creates an \n“arbitrary sex-based distinction,” Adams cannot amend the complaint by arguments made in an appellate brief. \nCf. Gilmour v. Gates, McDonald & Co., 382 F.3d 1312, 1315 (11th Cir. 2004) (explaining that a plaintiff may not \namend the complaint by argument in an appellate brief). \n \n3  Adams also argues that the appeal of the district court’s order should be classified as an as-applied challenge to the \n  School Board’s bathroom policy limited to Adams’s particular circumstances. But that does not help in our resolution \nof this appeal because “classifying a lawsuit as facial or as-applied ... does not speak at all to the substantive rule of \nlaw necessary to establish a constitutional violation.” Bucklew v. Precythe, ––– U.S. ––––, 139 S. Ct. 1112, 1127, 203 \nL.Ed.2d  521  (2019).  Indeed,  an  as-applied  challenge  merely  “affects  the  extent  to  which”  a  plaintiff  must \ndemonstrate “the invalidity of the challenged law” or constitutional violation and “the corresponding ‘breadth of \nthe remedy.’ ” Id. (quoting Citizens United v. FEC, 558 U.S. 310, 331, 130 S.Ct. 876, 175 L.Ed.2d 753 (2010)). But an \nalleged violation of one individual’s constitutional rights under the Equal Protection Clause would necessarily \nconstitute  a  violation  of  the  Equal  Protection  Clause  and  the  Constitution  at  large,  regardless  of  the \nindividually-applied remedy. Further, as we discuss below, equating “sex” to “gender identity” or “transgender \nstatus” under Title IX, as Adams would have us do as a matter of statutory interpretation, would touch upon the \ninterests of all Americans—not just Adams—who are students, as well as their parents or guardians, at institutions \nsubject to the statute. We therefore do not find merit in Adams’s attempt to cabin the lawsuit to Adams’s particular \ncircumstances. \n \n4  For purposes of this opinion, unless otherwise indicated, our references to “the dissent” in this opinion refer to \n  Judge Jill Pryor’s dissent. \n \n5  The dissent separately asserts that intermediate scrutiny applies on the ground that there is “no doubt that Adams, \n  as a transgender individual, is a member of a quasi-suspect class.” Jill Pryor Dis. Op. at ––––. We have two \nresponses. First, the dissent reaches this conclusion through a selective reading of the record, citing to exhibits and \ntestimony where it sees fit. But the dissent fails to acknowledge that the district court did not address the issue, \nexpressly stating that it had “no occasion to engage in the further analysis” as to whether “transgender people are a \nquasi-suspect class, deserving of heightened scrutiny per se.” Like the district court, we find no need to address the \nissue, given our conclusion that intermediate scrutiny applies, in any event. Second, and contrary to the dissent’s \nassertion, we have grave “doubt” that transgender persons constitute a quasi-suspect class. Indeed, the Supreme \nCourt has rarely deemed a group a quasi-suspect class. See, e.g., City of Cleburne, 473 U.S. at 442–46, 105 S.Ct. \n3249. \n46 \n \n\nAdams by and through Kasper v. School Board of St. Johns County, 57 F.4th 791 (2022)   \n \n \n \n6  Although we do not need to address whether Adams is “similarly situated” to biological boys in the School District \n  for purposes of reviewing the bathroom policy under the Equal Protection Clause in the first instance, we note that \nthere are serious questions as to whether Adams would meet this requirement. See City of Cleburne, 473 U.S. at \n439, 105 S.Ct. 3249. The promise of equal protection is limited to “keep[ing] governmental decisionmakers from \ntreating differently persons who are in all relevant respects alike.” Nordlinger, 505 U.S. at 10, 112 S.Ct. 2326. When \nit comes to the bathroom policy, biological sex is the “relevant respect[ ],” id., with respect to which persons must \nbe “similarly situated,” City of Cleburne, 473 U.S. at 439, 105 S.Ct. 3249, because biological sex is the sole \ncharacteristic on which the bathroom policy and the privacy interests guiding the bathroom policy are based. And \nbiological sex also is the driving force behind the Supreme Court’s sex-discrimination jurisprudence. See, e.g., \nNguyen, 533 U.S. at 73, 121 S.Ct. 2053 (“The difference between men and women in relation to the birth process is \na real one, and the principle of equal protection does not forbid Congress to address the problem at hand in a \nmanner specific [to men and women].”); Virginia, 518 U.S. at 533, 116 S.Ct. 2264 (“Physical differences between \nmen and women, however, are enduring: ‘[T]he two sexes are not fungible ....’ ” (first alteration in original) (quoting \nBallard v. United States, 329 U.S. 187, 193, 67 S.Ct. 261, 91 L.Ed. 181 (1946))); Frontiero, 411 U.S. at 686, 93 S.Ct. \n1764 (“[S]ex, like race and national origin, is an immutable characteristic determined solely by the accident of \nbirth.”). As the Supreme Court has made clear: “To fail to acknowledge even our most basic biological differences ... \nrisks making the guarantee of equal protection superficial, and so disserving it.” Nguyen, 533 U.S. at 73, 121 S.Ct. \n2053. \nAdams claims to be similarly situated to biological boys in the School District for purposes of the bathroom policy, \neven though Adams is not biologically male—the only characteristic on which the policy is based. Throughout the \npendency of this case, Adams remained both biologically and anatomically identical to biological females—not \nmales. Thus, in prohibiting Adams from using the male bathrooms, it can be argued that the School Board did not \n“treat[ ] differently persons who are in all relevant respects alike” for purposes of the Equal Protection Clause. \nNordlinger, 505 U.S. at 10, 112 S.Ct. 2326. \nTo argue otherwise, the dissent, like the district court, must assert that transgender status and gender identity \nare equivalent to biological sex. Indeed, this forms the foundation of the dissent’s attempt to frame this case not \nas a case about the constitutionality and legality of separating bathrooms based on biological sex but rather as a \ncase about the purported unlawfulness of excluding Adams—who attended school as a biological female—from \nusing the male bathroom because, as the dissent claims, Adams is a boy for purposes of the bathroom policy. But \nsuch an assertion is contrary to the Supreme Court’s reliance on physiological and biological differences between \nmen and women in its sex-discrimination decisions, which therefore raises serious questions about Adams’s \nsimilarly situated status for purposes of the bathroom policy under review. Such an assertion also is undercut by \nthe dissent’s refusal to engage the issue of gender fluidity—i.e., the practice, which the dissent acknowledges, in \nwhich some individuals claim to change gender identities associated with the male and female sexes and thereby \ntreat sex as a mutable characteristic. Jill Pryor Dis. Op. at –––– (“This case has no bearing on the question how to \nassign gender fluid individuals to sex-separated bathrooms.”). But see Frontiero, 411 U.S. at 686, 93 S.Ct. 1764 \n(“[S]ex, like race and national origin, is an immutable characteristic determined solely by the accident of birth.”). \nSuch an assertion is further undercut by the dissent’s attempt to categorize transgender persons as members of a \nquasi-suspect class, which necessarily entails treating transgender persons as distinct from the sexes with which \nthey identify. Jill Pryor Dis. Op. at –––– – ––––. Nevertheless, as the opinion concludes, the bathroom policy \npasses constitutional muster regardless of whether Adams is similarly situated to biological boys for purposes of \nthe bathroom policy because the policy’s sex-based classification satisfies intermediate scrutiny. \n \n7  Nevertheless, the dissent, using Bostock, argues “that ‘sex’ was a but-for cause of the discrimination Adams \n  experienced,” which the dissent argues violates Title IX. Jill Pryor Dis. Op. at ––––. This argument is of no avail. \nUnder the dissent’s theory, any lawful policy separating on the basis of “sex” pursuant to Title IX’s statutory and \n47 \n \n\nAdams by and through Kasper v. School Board of St. Johns County, 57 F.4th 791 (2022)   \n \n \nregulatory carve-outs would inherently provide the “but-for cause of ... discrimination” that the dissent is concerned \nabout because such a policy inherently involves distinguishing between the sexes from the outset. The dissent’s \ntheory, then, would swallow the carve-outs and render them meaningless because, as the dissent would have it, any \npolicy separating by “sex” would provide “a but-for cause of ... discrimination” if a litigant felt that she or he had \nbeen discriminated against by the sex-based separation authorized by the carve-outs. Adams, who is a biological \nfemale alleging discrimination based on not being able to access the bathrooms reserved for biological males, is no \ndifferent from such a litigant. \n \n8  Adams contends that the School Board made this argument—that Congress must condition funds under its Spending \n  Clause authority in an unambiguous way—for the first time on appeal. Thus, Adams argues that this Court should \nnot consider the School Board’s argument. Adams is incorrect. We are duty bound to apply the correct law; “parties \ncannot waive the application of the correct law or stipulate to an incorrect legal test.” Jefferson v. Sewon Am., Inc., \n891 F.3d 911, 923 (11th Cir. 2018); accord United States v. Lee, 29 F.4th 665, 669 n.2 (11th Cir. 2022) (finding that a \ndefendant could not waive the application of the Blockburger test in connection with asserting a violation of the \nDouble Jeopardy Clause). And we are required to apply the clear-statement rule to legislation passed under \nCongress’s Spending Clause authority. See, e.g., Davis, 526 U.S. at 640, 119 S.Ct. 1661 (“In interpreting language in \nspending legislation, we thus ‘insis[t] that Congress speak with a clear voice,’ recognizing that ‘[t]here can, of course, \nbe no knowing acceptance [of the terms of the putative contract] if a State is unaware of the conditions [imposed by \nthe legislation] or is unable to ascertain what is expected of it.’ ” (alternations in original) (quoting Pennhurst, 451 \nU.S. at 17, 101 S.Ct. 1531)). For these reasons, Adams’s contention lacks merit. \n \n1  Justinian’s Code, for example, recognized “hermaphrodites” and instructed they should be assigned whichever “sex \n  ... predominates.” 1 Enactments of Justinian: The Digest or Pandects, tit. 5 para. 10 (Scott ed. 1932). \n \n2  See, e.g., Zzyym v. Pompeo, 958 F.3d 1014 (10th Cir. 2020) (considering intersex identity on a passport application); \n  M.C. ex rel. Crawford v. Amrhein, 598 F. App’x 143, 149 (4th Cir. 2015) (considering whether sex reassignment \nsurgery  in  infancy  violated  a  constitutional  right  to  delay  medically  unnecessary  intervention);  Thompson  v. \nLengerich, 798 F. App’x 204, 213 (10th Cir. 2019) (considering equal protection implications for intersex inmates who \nare guaranteed private showers). \n \n3  Deanna Adkins, M.D., a pediatric endocrinologist at Duke University and expert for the plaintiff, explained this \n  condition in her report along with the following medical conditions that lead to intersex development: Complete \nAndrogen  Insensitivity, Klinefelter Syndrome,  Turner Syndrome, Mosaic  Turner Syndrome,  congenital  adrenal \nhyperplasia, and cloacal exstrophy. \n \n4  InterACT is an intersex advocacy organization. \n \n \n1  The district court awarded Drew the same damages for both the equal protection claim and the Title IX claim, noting \n  that the injuries arising out of these violations were “identical” and specifying that he was not entitled to double \nrecovery. See D.E. 192 at 68 n.58. As an affirmance on the equal protection claim is sufficient to uphold the \njudgment, I do not address the Title IX claim. \n48 \n \n\nAdams by and through Kasper v. School Board of St. Johns County, 57 F.4th 791 (2022)   \n \n \n \n2  The School Board has also instituted a policy creating a column on the “official student data panel” for “affirmed \n  name.” D.E. 161 at 112. This affirmed column “populates [the school’s] grade book, ... BASIS, which is [the school’s] \ninformation center, ... another database called Virtual Counselor, so that ... child’s affirmed name is changed on all \nthose databases.” Id. at 113. The purpose of the affirmed name column is to inform teachers of a student’s \npreferred name when it may be different from the student’s legal name. See id. Though Drew did not change his \nname, this affirmed column shows that the School Board could easily go back into its databases and records to \nupdate information that is outdated and/or may be contrary to a student’s gender identity. \n \n1  As Judge Jordan notes, see Jordan Dissent at –––– n.1, the district court awarded Drew the same damages on both \n  his equal-protection and Title IX claims because it found that the injuries arising out of these violations were \n“identical” and Adams was not entitled to double damages. See D.E. 192 at 68 n.58. Because affirming on Adams’s \nequal-protection claim is enough to uphold the judgment, I do not address the Title IX claim. \n \n2  I note that Judge Lagoa’s special concurrence limits itself to the Title IX analysis and does not discuss the \n  equal-protection analysis. For good reason. For the reasons I explain in this dissent, none of the arguments Judge \nLagoa asserts in her special concurrence have any application in the equal-protection context. Judge Lagoa’s \nconcurrence, which singles out the Title IX analysis for attack, implicitly concedes that its reasoning does not apply in \nthe equal-protection context. That is so because, as I explain, equal-protection analysis has a limiting principle—the \nfactual record. So affirming the district court’s equal-protection conclusion here would not require courts in this \nCircuit to find that all challenges involving restrooms, locker rooms, and changing facilities (and sports) must be \nupheld. \n \n3  Of course, even if this were correct—and it’s not, as I explain above—it would not be an acceptable reason to avoid \n  doing what the Equal Protection Clause requires. \n \n1  “Doc.” refers to docket entries in the district court record. \n \n \n2  The record treats the terms “sex” and “gender” as synonymous and interchangeable. Although the terms “sex” and \n  “gender” may refer to distinct, if interconnected, concepts, I am confined to the record, where the terms are used \nsynonymously. \n \n3  The School Board did not define “biological sex.” It contextualized the term by using words like “physiological” or \n  “anatomical” sex, but it did not explain what it meant by those words, either. Appellant’s En Banc Br. at 8. The \ndistrict court found that “biological sex” as used in the bathroom policy meant birth-assigned sex. Doc. 192 at 19. \nAnd at oral argument, the School Board confirmed that, for purposes of the policy,  “biological sex” meant \nbirth-assigned  sex.  In  using  the  term  “biological  sex,”  then,  the  School  Board  refers  to  only  one  biological \ncharacteristic—a child’s “external genitalia” which “has historically been used to determine gender for purposes of \nrecording a birth as male or female.” Id. at 6. \n49 \n \n\nAdams by and through Kasper v. School Board of St. Johns County, 57 F.4th 791 (2022)   \n \n \n \n4  Other unrebutted evidence made clear that the biological markers of sex “may not be in line with each other (e.g., a \n  person with XY chromosomes may have female-appearing genitalia).” Doc. 151-4 at 7; see also Wilson Dissenting \nOp. at –––– – –––– (describing examples of divergent sex components in intersex people). \n \n5  The acronym “LGBTQ” refers to: “lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and questioning (and/or queer).” Doc. 192 at \n  13 n.19. \n \n6  It is unclear whether the taskforce was aware of the policy at Aberli’s school specifically when it conducted its \n  review. The record supports, however, that the taskforce reviewed BCPS’s policy and other similar policies allowing \ntransgender students to use the restrooms corresponding to their gender identities. \n \n7  The term “gender fluid” likely carries a more nuanced meaning that the district court’s definition, but I am confined \n  to the way in which the term is used in the record. \n \n8  As part of its fact-finding, the district court went onsite to examine the bathrooms at Nease High School. The court \n  found “[t]here are four sets of multi-stall, sex-segregated bathrooms available” to Nease students. Doc. 192 at 23. \nThe boys’ restrooms have both urinals and stalls with doors. In addition, Nease has 11 gender-neutral single-stall \nbathrooms which are open to any student or staff member. There is no gender-neutral bathroom near the cafeteria; \na student who wishes to use a gender-neutral bathroom during lunch must ask permission to leave that area. \n \n9  Neither the School District nor the majority opinion even argues that any of the district court’s findings of fact are \n  clearly erroneous—they both simply ignore them. \n \n10  The School District argues that Adams is not similarly situated to “a biological male” because he is “a biological \n  female.” See En Banc Reply Br. at 6–7. Without outright agreeing, the majority opinion expresses doubt that Adams \nis similarly situated to “biological boys” in the School District for purposes of its bathroom policy, apparently \nbecause Adams—unlike the “biological boys” under the policy—was not assigned male at birth. Majority Op. at –––– \n– –––– n.6. By seeking to compare Adams’s treatment under the policy to that of “biological girls,” rather than to \nthat of cisgender boys, the School District (and in turn the majority opinion) reveals its own bias: “it believes that \n[Adams’s]  gender  identity  is  a  choice,  and  it  privileges  sex-assigned-at-birth  over  [his]  medically  confirmed, \n[biologically rooted,] persistent and consistent gender identity.” Grimm v. Gloucester Cnty. Sch. Bd., 972 F.3d 586, \n610 (4th Cir. 2020). “The overwhelming thrust of everything in the record ... is that [Adams] was similarly situated to \nother [cisgender] boys, but was excluded from using the boys restroom facilities based on his sex-assigned-at-birth.” \nId. “Adopting the [School District’s] framing of [Adams’s] equal protection claim here would only vindicate [its] own \nmisconceptions, which themselves reflect stereotypic notions.” Id. (internal quotation marks omitted). \nAnd, once again, the majority opinion’s reference to Supreme Court cases addressing the physical differences \nbetween men and women misses the point: those cases do not define what it means to be a man or a woman, so \nthey do not demonstrate that “biological sex” as the majority opinion sees that term—sex assigned at birth, or \nsex assigned at birth and chromosomal structure—was the “driving force behind” the Court’s sex-discrimination \n50 \n \n\nAdams by and through Kasper v. School Board of St. Johns County, 57 F.4th 791 (2022)   \n \n \njurisprudence. Maj. Op. at –––– n.6. We are in new territory here, despite the majority opinion’s refusal to \nexplore it. \n \n11  There is no dispute that the School Board is a state actor for the purposes of this lawsuit. \n \n \n12  Because the policy facially discriminates against transgender students, we do not need to discuss discriminatory \n  intent. Only when a law is neutral on its face but has a discriminatory impact does a plaintiff have to demonstrate \ndiscriminatory intent behind the policy or law. See generally Vill. of Arlington Heights v. Metro. Hous. Dev. Corp., 429 \nU.S. 252, 265, 97 S.Ct. 555, 50 L.Ed.2d 450 (1977). \n \n13  Adams argues that heightened scrutiny applies because: (1) the policy cannot be stated without referencing \n  sex-based classifications; (2) the bathroom policy excludes him on the basis of sex; (3) the bathroom policy relies on \nimpermissible stereotypes; (4) the policy creates two classes of transgender students; (5) transgender individuals \nconstitute a quasi-suspect class; (6) even if the policy is not facially discriminatory, it deliberately targets and \ndisparately impacts transgender individuals. \n \n14  The majority opinion and the School District contend that heightened scrutiny applies simply because the bathroom \n  policy separates the two sexes. \n \n15  The majority says it does not address the quasi-suspect-class issue because the district court did not do so. Maj. Op. \n  at –––– – –––– n.5. But we can affirm the district court’s decision that the Board’s policy violates the Equal \nProtection Clause on any basis supported by the record. Big Top Koolers, Inc. v. Circus-Man Snacks, Inc., 528 F.3d \n839, 844 (11th Cir. 2008). \n \n16  This exhibit comes from an organization called the American Psychiatric Association. It is a three-page document \n  called “Position Statement on Discrimination Against Transgender and Gender Variant Individuals.” Doc. 115-10. The \ndistrict court took judicial notice of this exhibit and others at Docket Entry 115 cited in this paragraph to the extent \nthe court “relied on the materials.” Doc. 192 at 13 n.19. \n \n17  This exhibit is also from the American Psychological Association. It is a five-page document captioned “Transgender, \n  Gender Identity, and Gender Expression Non-Discrimination.” Doc. 115-12 at 2. \n \n18  The district court took judicial notice of this report. See Doc. 192 at 8 n.15. \n \n \n19  This exhibit comes from an organization called the American Family Therapy Academy. It is a two-page document \n  called “Statement on Transgender Students.” Doc. 115-2. \n51 \n \n\nAdams by and through Kasper v. School Board of St. Johns County, 57 F.4th 791 (2022)   \n \n \n \n20  The majority opinion expresses “grave doubt” that transgender individuals belong to a quasi-suspect class, noting \n  that the Supreme Court has declined to designate individuals with intellectual disabilities as such. Maj. Op. at –––– \nn.5 (internal quotation marks omitted). In declining to deem those with intellectual disabilities members of a \nquasi-suspect  class,  the  Court  emphasized  “the  distinctive  legislative  response,  both  national  and  state,” \ndemonstrating that “lawmakers have been addressing their difficulties in a manner that belies a continuing apathy \nor prejudice.” Cleburne, 473 U.S. at 443, 105 S.Ct. 3249; see id. at 444, 105 S.Ct. 3249 (explaining that legislation had \n“singl[ed] out the [intellectually disabled] for special treatment” and that further legislative efforts to afford \nadditional special treatment should be encouraged rather than potentially discouraged with the application of \nheightened scrutiny). This included remedial efforts in funding, hiring, government services, and education. Id. at \n443, 105 S.Ct. 3249. This is not at all the case with transgender individuals. Instead of a nationwide effort to provide \n“special treatment” for members of this group, rampant discrimination continues largely unchecked. Indeed, \nlegislation that has the effect of limiting the rights of transgender individuals has been introduced (and in some \ncases, enacted) by legislatures in this country. No precedent prevents us from concluding that transgender people \nare a quasi-suspect class. \n \n21  I do not buy the majority opinion’s characterization of the School District’s bathroom policy as it applies to \n  transgender students “an accommodation” under which they could use either of two restroom options. Maj. Op. at \n––––. In practice, the policy forced transgender students like Adams to use only the gender-neutral bathrooms. \n \n22  The majority opinion points to the following stipulation as evidence of safety and privacy concerns: \n \nThe parties stipulate that certain parents of students and students in the St. Johns County School District object to \na policy or practice that would allow students to use a bathroom that matches their gender identity as opposed to \ntheir sex assigned at birth. These individuals believe that such a practice would violate the bodily privacy rights of \nstudents and raise privacy, safety and welfare concerns. Plaintiff submits this stipulation does not apply to himself \nor his parents. \nDoc. 116 at 22 ¶ 3. The import of this stipulation is lost on me. What do the personal beliefs of “certain” individuals \nin the School District have to do with whether the policy actually furthers the asserted privacy and security interests \nor is instead founded on stereotypic biases and assumptions? Id. And even if the stipulation provided some support \nfor the School District’s policy, how does it get the District close to the “exceedingly persuasive” fit it is required to \nestablish? Nguyen, 533 U.S. at 70, 121 S.Ct. 2053 (internal quotation marks omitted). It cannot and does not. \n \n23  The majority opinion asserts that Adams, the appellee, waived this line of argument by failing to raise it in the \n  district court or his opening brief to the panel. See Majority Op. at –––– – –––– & n.2. The majority opinion is \nmistaken. “Parties can most assuredly waive or forfeit positions and issues on appeal, but not individual arguments.” \nHi-Tech Parm. Inc. v. HBS Int’l Corp., 910 F.3d 1186, 1194 (11th Cir. 2018) (alteration adopted) (internal quotation \nmarks omitted). Adams did not waive this argument, but even if he had, we may affirm the district court on any \nbasis supported by the record. Wetherbee v. S. Co., 754 F.3d 901, 905 (11th Cir. 2014). \n \n24  The majority opinion asserts that the School District is owed deference regarding how it chooses to manage the \n  student population. That may be true in appropriate contexts, but no tenet of constitutional law provides that \nchildren “shed their constitutional rights ... at the schoolhouse gate.” Tinker v. Des Moines Indep. Cmty. Sch. Dist., \n52 \n \n\nAdams by and through Kasper v. School Board of St. Johns County, 57 F.4th 791 (2022)   \n \n \n393 U.S. 503, 506, 89 S.Ct. 733, 21 L.Ed.2d 731 (1969). None of the cases the majority opinion cites provides for a \ndoctrine of deference that would excuse a violation of a student’s equal protection rights. \n \n25  I therefore have no reason to address the majority opinion’s Spending Clause argument. The Spending Clause \n  cannon of construction arguably comes into play only if we find ourselves dealing with an ambiguous statute. See \ngenerally Pennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. v. Halderman, 451 U.S. 1, 17, 101 S.Ct. 1531, 67 L.Ed.2d 694 (1981). \n \n26  So, the majority is simply wrong when it asserts that my reading of Title IX would result in “dual protection ... based \n  on both sex and gender identity.” Maj. Op. at –––– (emphasis omitted). On this record, we can discern that gender \nidentity is one of the components of a person’s sex, so protection based on gender identity is protection based on \nsex. \n \n27  Again, and importantly, the Court in Bostock merely assumed that “sex” did not include gender identity. Bostock, \n  140 S. Ct. at 1739. \n \n28  In a special concurrence, Judge Lagoa writes that permitting “sex” under Title IX to include gender identity would \n  require that institutions allow transgender girls to participate in girls’ sports. She worries that such integration \nthreatens to undermine the progress girls and women have made via participation in Title IX programs. See Lagoa \nConcurring Op. at ––––. But there is no empirical data supporting the fear that transgender girls’ participation in \ngirls’ sports in any way undermines the experience and benefits of sports to cisgender girls. The fact that there may \nbe biological differences between transgender and cisgender girls does not mean that transgender girls will so \noverwhelm girls’ sports programs with competitive advantages as to undermine the value of girls’ sports for \ncisgender girls. For one thing, there will never be many transgender girls who participate in girls’ sports, considering \nthe very low percentage of the population identifying as transgender, only some of whom identify as girls and many \nof whom will not compete in sports. See Jody L. Herman et al., UCLA School of Law Williams Institute, How Many \nAdults  and  Youth  Identify  as  Transgender  in  the  United  States?  (June  2022), \nhttps://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/publications/trans-adultsunited-states  (last  accessed  Dec.  28,  2022) \n(estimating that less than 1.5% of the youth population identifies as transgender). For another, an abundance of \nbiological differences has always existed among cisgender girls and women, who compete against one another \ndespite some having distinct biological advantages over others. See, e.g., Canadian Center for Ethics in Sport \nE-Alliance,  Transgender  Women  Athletes  and  Elite  Sport:  A  Scientific  Review  at  18–30  (2022), \nhttps://www.transathlete.com/_files/ugd/2bc3fc_428201144e8c4a5595fc748ff8190104.pdf  (“E-Alliance  Review”) \n(last accessed Dec. 28, 2022) (analyzing biological factors affecting trans- and cis- women athletes’ participation in \nhigh performance sports and concluding that there is no compelling evidence, with or without testosterone \nsuppression, of performance benefits that can be traced directly to transgender status). Indeed, something as \nsimple as being left-handed may offer a significant competitive advantage in some sports, and yet we do not \nhandicap or ban left-handed girls in Title IX-funded programs. See Steph Yin, Do Lefties Have an Advantage in \nSports?  It  Depends,  https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/21/science/lefties-sports-advantage.html  (last  accessed \nDec. 28, 2022). Plus, to adopt Judge Lagoa’s concerns is to deny the myriad ways in which transgender girls and \nwomen  are  disadvantaged  in  athletics,  further  casting  doubt  on  any  fears  that  transgender  athletes  will \noverwhelmingly dominate, and somehow spoil, girls’ sports. See E-Alliance Review at 36–38. \nWhat is more, Judge Lagoa’s concurrence fails to acknowledge the value that inclusion of transgender girls may \nhave on girls’ sports, both to trans- and cisgender girls. It is well documented that the primary beneficiaries of \nTitle IX have been white girls from socioeconomically-advantaged backgrounds. Alanis Thames, Equity in Sports \n53 \n \n\nAdams by and through Kasper v. School Board of St. Johns County, 57 F.4th 791 (2022)   \n \n \nhas  Focused  on  Gender,  Not  Race.  So  Gaps  Persist, \nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/30/sports/title-ix-race.html (last accessed Dec. 28, 2022). Integration into \ngirls’  sports  of  girls,  including  transgender  girls,  who  may  have  gone  without  such  historical  privileges, \nundoubtedly would benefit the whole of girls’ sports. \n \n29  And no, my reading does not “swallow the carve-outs and render them meaningless.” Maj. Op. at –––– n.7. Rather, \n  my reading recognizes the limits to the carveouts—they cannot provide carte blanche for educational institutions to \nset policies defining “sex” in a manner that discriminates against transgender students like Adams. This is why the \nmajority opinion’s hypothetical of “a biological female student, who does not identify as transgender and who sued \nher school under Title IX to gain access to the male bathroom,” Maj. Op. at ––––, is unenlightening. The majority is \nof course correct that “preventing the female student from using the male bathroom would constitute separation \non the basis of sex.” Id. But the majority’s hypothetical case—where all biological markers of the female student \npoint to one sex—falls squarely within the carveouts, and this case—for all the reasons I have just explained—does \nnot. The majority’s hypothetical, based on its counterfactual assumption that sex is a single-factor label, is not a \nhelpful analytical tool in this case. \n \n \n \n \nEnd of Document   \n \n \n \n \n54 \n ",

(Title IX), and the Equal Protection \nClause. The United States enforces Title IX to protect students from sex discrimination in federally funded education \nprograms and activities.

Where it serves as a federal funding agency, \nor upon referral from the Department of Education or other funding agencies, DOJ may enforce Title IX against recipients of \nfederal financial assistance. 20 U.S.C. 1682. DOJ also may investigate and resolve complaints that a school board is \ndepriving students of equal protection based on sex, 42 U.S.C. 2000c-6, and may intervene in cases of general public \nimportance  involving  alleged  denials  of  the  “equal  protection  of  the  laws  under  the  fourteenth  amendment  to  the \nConstitution,” 42 U.S.C. 2000h-2. \n4 \n \n\n \n \nDrew ADAMS, Plaintiff-Appellee, v. SCHOOL BOARD OF..., 2021 WL 5630400...   \n \n \n  \nSTATEMENT OF THE ISSUES \n  \n1. Whether the school board violated the Equal Protection Clause when it prohibited Drew Adams, a boy who is transgender, \nfrom using the boys’ restrooms. \n  \n2. Whether the school board violated Title IX when it prohibited Adams from using the boys’ restrooms. \n  \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \n  \n1. Procedural History \n  \nIn June 2017 plaintiff-appellee Drew Adams, a transgender boy, sued the School Board of St. John’s County (School Board) \nin the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida, claiming that the School Board’s refusal to permit him to use the \nboys’ restrooms violated the Equal Protection Clause and Title IX, *3 20 U.S.C. 1681. Doc. 192, at 3.1 After a bench trial, the \ndistrict court ruled for Adams on both his Equal Protection Clause and Title IX claims (Doc. 192, at 53, 65-69) and entered \njudgment in his favor. Doc. 193. \n  \nOn August 7, 2020, a panel of this Court affirmed the judgment in favor of Adams on both his equal protection and Title IX \nclaims. The School Board petitioned for rehearing en banc, and on July 14, 2021, the panel vacated its opinion and issued a \nnew opinion, again affirming the district court’s judgment on Adams’s equal protection claim but declining to reach his Title \nIX claim. The School Board filed another petition for rehearing en banc, which this Court granted on August 23, 2021. \n  \n2. Background \n  \na. The School Board’s Restroom Policy \n  \nThis case involves a challenge to the School Board’s refusal to permit Drew Adams, a transgender boy, to use the boys’ \nrestrooms.2 Schools in the St. John’s County School District have long had separate restrooms for boys and girls. Doc. 192, at \n14. In September 2015, the School Board adopted “Best Practices *4 Guidelines” addressing the treatment of transgender \nstudents. The Guidelines generally provide that transgender students should be treated in accordance with their gender \nidentities in multiple respects, including their names, dress, pronouns, and unofficial school records. Doc. 192, at 15-16. The \nGuidelines also provide that “[t]ransgender students will be given access to a gender-neutral restroom and will not be \nrequired to use the restroom corresponding to their biological sex.” Doc. 192, at 16-17 (alteration in original). \n  \nAlthough the School Board was aware that other Florida school districts had adopted policies permitting transgender students \nto use the restrooms corresponding with their gender identity, it decided instead that transgender students must use either the \nrestrooms corresponding to their “biological sex” or gender-neutral, single-stall bathrooms. Doc. 192, at 16-18.3 To determine \n“biological sex,” the School Board uses the sex listed in the student’s original school enrollment documents. Doc. 192, at \n13-14. The School Board maintained that its policy was necessary to protect student privacy and safety but admitted that all \nrestrooms had doors separating the bathroom stalls and that it had never received any complaints of transgender students \nengaging in inappropriate behavior in the restrooms. Doc. 192, at 20-21. \n  \n*5 b. Plaintiff Drew Adams \n  \nPlaintiff Drew Adams, who was assigned female at birth, enrolled in the St. John’s County School District in 2010, when he \n5 \n \n\n \n \nDrew ADAMS, Plaintiff-Appellee, v. SCHOOL BOARD OF..., 2021 WL 5630400...   \n \n \nwas in the fourth grade. Doc. 192, at 2, 24. At the end of eighth grade, Adams came out as transgender and, under a \npsychologist’s care, began transitioning. Doc. 192, at 10-11. He cut his hair short, began wearing boys’ clothing, asked others \nto refer to him using male pronouns, and began using the men’s restrooms in public. Doc. 192, at 11. In 2016, under an \nendocrinologist’s supervision, Adams began taking testosterone to make his body more masculine and birth control pills to \nhalt menstruation. Doc. 192, at 11. In May 2017, he had a double mastectomy. Doc. 192, at 11. He also changed the sex listed \non his Florida driver’s license and birth certificate, both of which now identify him as male. Doc. 192, at 11-12. \n  \nBefore he entered ninth grade, Adams’s mother informed the School Board that Adams was transitioning and would start \nhigh school as a boy. Doc. 192, at 24-25. At first, Adams used the boys’ restrooms without incident. But six weeks after \nschool began, two girls told school officials they had seen Adams entering a boys’ restroom. Doc. 192, at 25. The school \ninformed  Adams  that  he  could  no  longer  use  the  boys’  restrooms  but  must  use  either  the  girls’  restrooms  or  the \ngender-neutral restrooms. Doc. 192, at 25. Adams and his mother tried for two years to resolve the issue informally with the \nschool but were unsuccessful. Doc. *6 192, at 25-26. Adams then sued the School Board in federal district court, alleging \nviolations of the Equal Protection Clause and Title IX. Doc. 192, at 3. \n  \nc. The District Court Decision \n  \nAfter a three-day bench trial involving testimony from ten witnesses, the district court ruled for Adams on both his Equal \nProtection Clause and Title IX claims. Doc. 192, at 53, 65. \n  \ni. With respect to Adams’s equal protection claim, the parties agreed that the policy was a sex-based classification and thus \nwas subject to intermediate scrutiny. Doc. 192, at 36-37 & n.37. Applying intermediate scrutiny, the district court first held \nthat the policy did not serve the School Board’s privacy interests. The court relied in part on the fact that all restrooms at \nAdams’s school had separate stalls with doors, so no students, including Adams, need expose their anatomy to other students. \nDoc. 192, at 40. The court noted that there was no evidence that a transgender student had ever invaded another student’s \nprivacy in the restroom. Doc. 192, at 39-40. Nor was there any evidence that transgender students were more curious about \nother students’ anatomy, and in any case, any student engaged in voyeurism would be subject to discipline. Doc. 192, at 40. \nThe court thus concluded that “[b]ased on the evidence at trial,” the policy did not further student privacy. Doc. 192, at 41. \n  \n*7 The district court similarly found that the policy did not advance the School Board’s interest in student safety, as there was \n“no evidence that Adams encountered any safety concerns during the six weeks he used the boys’ restroom”; no “evidence \nthat transgender students might expose themselves to other students in the restroom”; and “no evidence that Adams presents \nany safety risk to other students or that transgender students are more likely than anyone else to assault or molest another \nstudent in the bathroom.” Doc. 192, at 41, 43. The court emphasized that “[n]one of the school officials who testified had \never heard of an incident where student safety was compromised by the presence of a transgender student in the restroom that \nmatched his or her gender identity.” Doc. 192, at 43. Accordingly, the court concluded that privacy and safety concerns \n“simply aren’t realized when transgender students use school bathrooms aligned with their gender identity.” Doc. 192, at 52. \n  \nii. The district court next held that the policy violated Title IX, which prohibits discrimination in federally funded education \nprograms “on the basis of sex.” 20 U.S.C. 1681(a); see Doc. 192, at 65. The court rejected the School Board’s argument that \nbecause Title IX’s implementing regulations permit schools to provide “separate toilet, locker room, and shower facilities on \nthe basis of sex,” 34 C.F.R. 106.33, the statute must permit separate restrooms on the basis of “biological sex.” Doc. 192, at \n58. The court explained that “Adams is not *8 contending that the school cannot provide separate restrooms for the sexes,” \nonly that he “should be permitted to use the boys’ restrooms.” Doc. 192, at 58-59. \n  \nThe district court granted Adams injunctive relief and $1,000 in compensatory damages. Doc. 192, at 66-69. Holding, \nhowever, that it “ha[d] had no occasion * * * to determine what threshold of transition, if any, is necessary for the School \nBoard to accommodate other transgender students,” the court limited its injunction to Adams. Doc. 192, at 66. \n  \nThe School Board appealed. Doc. 194. \n  \nd. Bostock v. Clayton County \n6 \n \n\n \n \nDrew ADAMS, Plaintiff-Appellee, v. SCHOOL BOARD OF..., 2021 WL 5630400...   \n \n \n  \nWhile the School Board’s appeal was pending, the Supreme Court decided Bostock v. Clayton County, 140 S. Ct. 1731 \n(2020). The Court held that firing an individual because of their sexual orientation or gender identity violates Title VII of the \nCivil Rights Act of 1964 (Title VII), which prohibits employers from “discriminat[ing] against any individual * * * because \nof such individual’s race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.” 42 U.S.C. 2000e-2(a)(1). \n  \nIn reaching that conclusion, the Bostock Court declined to adopt a definition of “sex,” but assumed for the sake of argument \nthat when Title VII was passed in 1964, the word “sex” referred “only to biological distinctions between male and female.” \n140 S. Ct. at 1739. The Court then analyzed the meaning of the phrase “because of * * * sex.” The Court acknowledged that \nTitle VII allows for *9 liability in cases where sex was a “motivating factor” in the challenged practice, but “because nothing \nin [the Court’s] analysis depend [ed] on the motivating factor test, [the Court] focus[ed] on the more traditional but-for \ncausation.” Id. at 1740. The Court explained that “a but-for test directs us to change one thing at a time and see if the \noutcome changes. If it does, we have found a but-for cause.” Id. at 1739. Applying this “simple test” to the facts before it, the \nCourt concluded, “it is impossible to discriminate against a person for being * * * transgender without discriminating against \nthat individual based on sex.” Id. at 1741. \n  \nThe Court also analyzed the term “discriminate against” in Title VII. Bostock, 140 S. Ct. at 1740. The Court discussed two \nrelated conceptions of the term: (1) “distinctions or differences in treatment that injure protected individuals,” id. at 1753 \n(quoting Burlington N. & Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. White, 548 U.S. 53, 59 (2006)); and (2) “treating [an] individual worse than \nothers who are similarly situated.” Id. at 1740. Because of this emphasis on the injury to the individual, the Court concluded \nit was no defense for an employer to say it would have fired both a man and a woman for being gay or transgender. In both \ncases, the Court held, the employer discriminates against the individual because of their sex. Id. at 1741. \n  \n*10 SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT \n  \nThe School Board violated both the Equal Protection Clause and Title IX by prohibiting Adams, a transgender boy, from \nusing the boys’ restrooms. \n  \n1. The School Board’s restroom policy with respect to transgender students is a sex-based classification and, as such, \nwarrants intermediate scrutiny. The School Board thus must show that its decision to exclude Adams from the boys’ \nrestrooms substantially furthered an important government interest. \n  \nThe district court correctly found that the School Board failed to make this showing. First, prohibiting Adams from using the \nboys’ restrooms does not further the School Board’s asserted interest in privacy because the boys’ restrooms at Adams’s high \nschool have individual, private stalls that are designed to prevent exposure of a student’s anatomy. The School Board failed \nto show that Adams was more likely than cisgender boys to infringe the privacy of other students or that existing \nstudent-discipline policies would not sufficiently address any instance of misconduct. Second, the School Board’s refusal to \naccept updated documents in determining a transgender student’s sex is arbitrary. The School Board has failed to advance a \npersuasive justification for rejecting updated documents or explain how doing so furthers its interest in protecting privacy. \n  \nFinally, the School Board’s argument that it did not violate the Equal Protection Clause because Adams is not similarly \nsituated to cisgender boys is *11 erroneous. Adams identifies and presents as a boy, meaning he lives as a boy in every aspect \nof his life. Any anatomical differences Adams may have from cisgender boys are irrelevant to his use of private stalls in the \ncommunal restrooms at his high school. \n  \n2. The School Board’s exclusion of Adams from the boys’ restrooms also violated Title IX, 20 U.S.C. 1681. Under the \nSupreme Court’s reasoning in Bostock v. Clayton County, 140 S. Ct. 1731 (2020), the School Board discriminated against \nAdams on the basis of sex by treating him differently than if he had been assigned male at birth, thereby causing him harm. It \nalso discriminated against Adams by treating him worse than cisgender boys, to whom he was similarly situated for purposes \nof bathroom use. \n  \nFinally, the School Board, a recipient of federal funding, argues that the Court must resolve any ambiguities in Title IX \n7 \n \n\n \n \nDrew ADAMS, Plaintiff-Appellee, v. SCHOOL BOARD OF..., 2021 WL 5630400...   \n \n \nregarding the term “sex” in its favor given that the statute was enacted pursuant to Congress’s spending power. The School \nBoard forfeited this argument, but, in any event, it is misplaced. This Court has held that as long as a Spending Clause statute \nclearly prohibits discrimination, it need not specify every manner of that discrimination. And regardless of how “sex” is \ndefined,  the  School  Board’s  exclusion  of  Adams  from  the  boys’  restrooms  violated  Title  IX  by  subjecting  him  to \ndiscriminatory injury on that basis. \n  \n*12 ARGUMENT \nAs the School Board acknowledges, “Adams does not challenge the authority of the School Board to separate bathrooms on \nthe basis of sex.” Br. 11; see also Br. 22. Rather, Adams challenges only the School Board’s refusal to treat him as a boy for \npurposes of restroom use despite treating him as a boy for all other purposes. Doc. 192, at 2, 15-16, 58-59. As the district \ncourt found, Adams has confirmed his identity as a boy socially, physically, medically, and on legal documents, such as his \nbirth certificate. Doc. 192, at 2, 46. As discussed below, the School Board’s refusal to allow Adams to use the boys’ \nrestrooms violated his rights under the Equal Protection Clause and Title IX. \n  \nI \nTHE SCHOOL BOARD VIOLATED THE EQUAL PROTECTION CLAUSE WHEN IT PROHIBITED ADAMS \nFROM USING THE BOYS’ RESTROOMS \nThe Equal Protection Clause generally prohibits government actors “from treating differently persons who are in all relevant \nrespects alike.” Nordlinger v. Hahn, 505 U.S. 1, 10 (1992). As discussed below, the School Board’s refusal to allow Adams \nto use the boys’ restrooms at his high school violated the Equal Protection Clause. \n  \n*13 A. Intermediate Scrutiny Applies Because The School Board’s Policy Classifies Based On Sex \nAs the School Board agrees, its restroom policy classifies students based on sex and therefore is subject to intermediate \nscrutiny. Br. 11-12, 14. The School Board’s policy prohibits transgender students from using the restrooms that align with \ntheir gender identity if their gender identity does not correspond to the sex listed in their original enrollment documents. As \nthe district court held, this policy “cannot be stated without referencing sex-based classifications.” Doc. 192, at 35. And \ntreating the policy as a sex-based classification for equal-protection purposes accords with the approach of the two other \ncourts  of  appeals  to  have  examined  similar  bathroom  policies;  both  courts  agreed  that  school  policies  that  exclude \ntransgender students from school restrooms that correspond to their gender identity are classifications based on sex and \nthereby warrant intermediate scrutiny. See Grimm v. Gloucester Cnty. Sch. Bd., 972 F.3d 586, 608 (4th Cir. 2020), cert. \ndenied, 141 S. Ct. 2878 (2021); Whitaker by Whitaker v. Kenosha Unified Sch. Dist. No. 1 Bd. of Educ., 858 F.3d 1034, \n1045-1046, 1051 (7th Cir. 2017). \n  \nWhere, as here, a policy classifies individuals on the basis of sex, the party seeking to uphold the policy “must carry the \nburden of showing an ‘exceedingly persuasive justification’ for the classification.” Mississippi Univ. for Women v. Hogan, \n458 U.S. 718, 723-724 (1982) (citation omitted). The classification “must serve important governmental objectives and must \nbe substantially related to *14 achievement of those objectives,” Craig v. Boren, 429 U.S. 190, 197 (1976), and its \njustification must not be “hypothesized,” United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 533 (1996) (VMI). The School Board failed \nto meet this burden here. \n  \nB. The Policy Fails Intermediate Scrutiny \n8 \n \n\n \n \nDrew ADAMS, Plaintiff-Appellee, v. SCHOOL BOARD OF..., 2021 WL 5630400...   \n \n \n1. The Policy Fails Intermediate Scrutiny Because It Does Not Further Student Privacy \nTo survive intermediate scrutiny, the justification for a policy must actually further the government’s asserted interest. VMI, \n518 U.S. at 533; Kirchberg v. Feenstra, 450 U.S. 455, 461 (1981). Where, as here, the School Board fails to proffer any \nevidence that its exclusion of Adams from the boys’ restrooms furthers its asserted interest and instead offers only “sheer \nconjecture and abstraction,” Whitaker, 858 F.3d at 1052, the policy cannot survive. \n  \nAfter a bench trial, the district court specifically found that Adams’s presence in the boys’ restrooms did not further the \nSchool Board’s interest in privacy. Doc. 192, at 39-41.4 That factual finding can be overturned only for clear error. And there \nwas none here. The court found that “[w]hen he goes into a restroom, Adams enters a stall, closes the door, relieves himself, \ncomes out of the stall, washes his hands, and leaves.” Doc. 192, at 39. It also found that “there *15 were no reports of \nproblems from any boys or boys’ parents during the six weeks of his freshman year when Adams used the boys’ restrooms \nat” school. Doc. 192, at 39. Addressing the School Board’s argument that “girls may want privacy in the restrooms while \ntalking to their peers, changing clothes (which can be done in a stall), putting on make-up, or removing stains from their \nclothing,” the court observed that those activities do not require girls “to expose their anatomy to other students such that \nhaving a transgender student in the restroom would invade their bodily privacy.” Doc. 192, at 40. Indeed, the court noted the \nabsence of evidence that any school official “had ever heard of any incident anywhere where a transgender student using a \nrestroom acted in a manner that invaded another student’s privacy.” Doc. 192, at 39-40. \n  \nAs to the School Board’s concern that a transgender boy could peek at other boys using the urinals, the district court found \nthat “this is not a real concern for several reasons.” Doc. 192, at 40. First, “Adams cannot use a urinal and always uses a \nstall.” Doc. 192, at 40. Second, “there is no evidence that a transgender boy is more likely to be curious about another \nstudent’s anatomy than any other boy” or that “transgender students might expose themselves to other students in the \nrestroom.” Doc. 192, at 40-41. On the contrary, the court found that “transgender students want to be discrete [sic] about their \nanatomy so other students do not recognize them as anything but the gender with which they identify.” Doc. 192, at *16 41. \nAnd if the School Board were to find any student--transgender or cisgender--behaving inappropriately in a restroom, the \nschool can and should address such behavior. Doc. 192, at 40. \n  \nOther courts similarly have held that student privacy interests are not threatened by transgender-inclusive bathroom policies. \nFor  example,  in  Grimm,  the  Fourth  Circuit  held  that  a  policy  excluding  transgender  students  from  the  restrooms \ncorresponding to their gender identity “ignores the reality of how a transgender child uses the bathroom: by entering a stall \nand closing the door.” 972 F.3d at 613-615 (quoting Whitaker, 858 F.3d at 1052). The court also emphasized that there was \nno “evidence that a transgender student * * * is likely to be a peeping tom, rather than minding their own business like any \nother student.” Id. at 614. The court explained that across the country, school districts with policies permitting transgender \nstudents to use restrooms consistent with their gender identity had found such privacy concerns to be unfounded. Ibid. \n  \nSimilarly, in Whitaker, the Seventh Circuit considered the school district’s “legitimate interest in ensuring that bathroom \nprivacy rights are protected,” noting that “this interest must be weighed against the facts of the case and not just examined in \nthe abstract, to determine whether this justification is genuine.” 858 F.3d at 1052. After conducting that factual inquiry, the \ncourt held that “[a] transgender student’s presence in the restroom provides no more of a risk to other *17 students’ privacy \nrights than * * * any other student who uses the bathroom at the same time.” Ibid. The court stated that “[c]ommon sense tells \nus that the communal restroom is a place where individuals act in a discreet manner to protect their privacy and those who \nhave true privacy concerns are able to utilize a stall.” Ibid. \n  \nTo the extent the School Board equates an interest in “privacy” to the alleged discomfort of other students, that discomfort \ncannot justify excluding Adams from the boys’ restrooms. See City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Ctr., 473 U.S. 432, \n450-451 (1985); see also Doe v. Boyertown Area Sch. Dist., 897 F.3d 518, 529 n.69 (3d Cir. 2018).5 But even if other \nstudents’ possible discomfort were a valid consideration, that consideration cuts against a policy that potentially would send \nAdams, who identifies and presents as a boy, to the girls’ restrooms. See Grimm, 972 F.3d at 622 (Wynn, J., concurring). At \nthe same time, the School Board’s argument notably ignores that excluding Adams from the boys’ restrooms infringes his \nprivacy interests. See Doc. 192, at 44-45 (describing how Adams experienced stigma and a sense of being singled out as \n“different”); see also *18 Grimm, 972 F.3d at 597 (“When being forced to use a special restroom or one that does not align \n9 \n \n\n \n \nDrew ADAMS, Plaintiff-Appellee, v. SCHOOL BOARD OF..., 2021 WL 5630400...   \n \n \nwith their gender, more than 40% of transgender students fast, dehydrate, or find ways not to use the restroom.”) (internal \ncitation omitted). \n  \nFinally,  the  School  Board’s  concern  regarding  “how  to  reliably  ensure  student  privacy  concerns  are  protected  with \ngender-fluid students whose gender identity may change from day-to-day” (Br. 5) is misplaced because this case does not \nconcern a gender-fluid student. Doc. 192, at 46. Rather, “the question here is whether to permit a transgender boy who has \ntaken significant social, medical and legal measures to present as a boy * * * to have access to the boys’ restroom.” Doc. 192, \nat 46. On this record, the answer is yes, as the School Board presented no evidence that Adams’s presence in the boys’ \nrestroom compromised the privacy of any student.6 \n  \n*19 2. The Policy Fails Intermediate Scrutiny Because It Is Arbitrary \nThe School Board’s policy also fails intermediate scrutiny because the refusal to accept updated legal documentation to \ndetermine a student’s sex is unreasonable. To withstand intermediate scrutiny, sex-based classifications “must be reasonable, \n[and] not arbitrary.” Reed v. Reed, 404 U.S. 71, 76 (1971) (quoting Royster Guano Co. v. Virginia, 253 U.S. 412, 415 \n(1920)). \n  \nThe School Board fails to explain how it advances any student’s privacy to reject Adams’s current legal documentation, \nincluding his amended birth certificate, in favor of outdated documentation in his fourth-grade enrollment package. Though \nthe School Board claims that the sex marker on a student’s enrollment paperwork is a “proxy” for “biological sex” (Br. 4), it \nhas not connected the need to use “biological sex” to its asserted interest in privacy. In other words, if the point of the policy \nis “insuring bathroom privacy from the opposite sex” (Br. 15), the School Board fails to demonstrate how it advances that \ninterest to classify Adams, who identifies and presents as male, and whom the State of Florida recognizes as male, as a \nfemale for purposes of bathroom use. \n  \nThe School Board counters that it “is not required to show that the policy is a perfect fit with its objective or that the policy \nachieves its stated goal in every instance.” Br. 16. But whether or not the policy is largely “accurate”-- i.e., it usually \nsucceeds in its goal to ensure “privacy from the opposite sex”--is beside *20 the point. The Supreme Court repeatedly has \ninvalidated sex-based classifications whether or not they are predictively accurate. See, e.g., Craig, 429 U.S. at 201-202; \nFrontiero v. Richardson, 411 U.S. 677, 688-689 (1973). As the Court has emphasized, “[p]rocedure by presumption is \nalways cheaper and easier than individualized determination,” but when a policy “explicitly disdains present realities in \ndeference to past formalities, it needlessly risks running roughshod over the important interests of” individual students. \nStanley v. Illinois, 405 U.S. 645, 656-657 (1972). \n  \nMoreover, in both Craig and Frontiero, the Court found it particularly salient that, despite empirical data that purportedly \njustified the differential treatment, there was no evidence that the statutes actually achieved their purported goals. See Craig, \n429 U.S. at 204; Frontiero, 411 U.S. at 689. The same is true here. As the district court found, based on the evidence, \nexcluding Adams from the boys’ restrooms does not further student privacy. Doc. 192, at 41. \n  \n3. The Policy Treats Adams Differently Than Cisgender Boys, To Whom He Is Similarly Situated \nThe School Board nonetheless argues that its policy does not violate equal-protection principles because Adams was not \nsimilarly situated to cisgender boys. Br. 10-11. This argument is unpersuasive. The Board fails to identify any sound basis for \ntreating Adams differently than cisgender boys for purposes of using the school restrooms, even while treating him as a boy \nfor other purposes. Doc. 192, *21 at 2, 15-16. As the district court found, Adams identifies and presents physically as a boy. \nDoc. 192, at 11. \n  \nEven if Adams has some anatomical differences from cisgender boys, those differences are not observable when Adams goes \ninto a private bathroom stall and closes the door. To justify differential treatment, the differences must actually be relevant to \n10 \n \n\n \n \nDrew ADAMS, Plaintiff-Appellee, v. SCHOOL BOARD OF..., 2021 WL 5630400...   \n \n \nthe government’s asserted justification. See City of Cleburne, 473 U.S. at 448; see also Reed, 404 U.S. at 76 (“A \nclassification * * * must rest upon some ground of difference having a fair and substantial relation to the object of the \nlegislation.”) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). The School Board does not explain how any differences Adams \nmay have from cisgender boys--which no other student sees in the restroom--are more relevant for purposes of bathroom use \nthan his similarities to those same boys--which other students see every day. \n  \nBecause Adams’s unseen anatomical differences from cisgender boys have no bearing on the School Board’s privacy \njustification, the cases the School Board cites (Br. 17) in which the Supreme Court has upheld sex-based classifications are \ninapposite. See, e.g., Michael M. v. Superior Court of Sonoma Cnty., 450 U.S. 464, 471 (1981); Parham v. Hughes, 441 U.S. \n347, 355 (1979). In those cases, unlike here, the differences between the sexes actually were relevant to the purposes of the \nsex-based classifications at issue. See Doc. 192, at 47-49. \n  \n*22 For these reasons, the School Board’s refusal to permit Adams to use the boys’ restrooms violated the Equal Protection \nClause. \n  \nII \nTHE SCHOOL BOARD VIOLATED TITLE IX WHEN IT PROHIBITED ADAMS FROM USING THE BOYS’ \nRESTROOMS \nTitle IX provides that “[n]o person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied \nthe benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial \nassistance.” 20 U.S.C. 1681(a). The Department of Education’s Title IX regulation allows for sex-segregated restroom \nfacilities. 34 C.F.R. 106.33. But the regulation does not define “sex” or speak to how it applies to transgender students. As \nexplained below, by prohibiting Adams from using the boys’ restroom, the School Board violated Title IX. \n  \nA. The School Board’s Policy Discriminated Against Adams “On The Basis Of Sex” In Violation Of Title IX \nThe Supreme Court’s reasoning in Bostock v. Clayton County, 140 S. Ct. 1731 (2020), demonstrates that the School Board \nviolated Title IX when it excluded Adams from the boys’ restrooms. See Grimm v. Gloucester Cnty. Sch. Bd., 972 F.3d 586, \n616 (4th Cir. 2020) (finding “little difficulty” after Bostock in “holding that a bathroom policy precluding” a transgender boy \n“from using the *23 boys restrooms discriminated against him ‘on the basis of sex’ ” in violation of Title IX), cert. denied, \n141 S. Ct. 2878 (2021). \n  \nFirst, Bostock recognized that “the term ‘discriminate against’ includes ‘distinctions or differences in treatment that injure \nprotected individuals.’ ” 140 S. Ct. at 1753 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Sex discrimination thus occurs \nwhen (1) a school treats a student differently than it would have if the student had been assigned a different sex at birth, id. at \n1741; and (2) such differential treatment injures the student, id. at 1753; see also Grimm, 972 F.3d at 616. \n  \nThe School Board acknowledges that, by excluding Adams from the boys’ restroom, it treated him differently than it would \nhave if he had been assigned male at birth. Br. 21. It argues, though, that “if excluding Adams from the boys’ bathroom is \nactionable sex discrimination under Title IX,” then any cisgender girl “would also have a claim for sex discrimination” under \nthe statute. Br. 21. The School Board is wrong because there is no plausible claim that prohibiting a cisgender female student \nfrom using the boys’ restrooms would injure that student. It is this combination of differential treatment and injury that, \nunder Bostock, constitutes prohibited discrimination--not differential treatment alone. \n  \nIt cannot seriously be disputed that prohibiting Adams from using the boys’ restrooms harmed him. He testified to feeling \n“alienated and humiliated,” stating *24 that “it causes him anxiety and depression to walk past the boys’ restrooms on his \n11 \n \n\n \n \nDrew ADAMS, Plaintiff-Appellee, v. SCHOOL BOARD OF..., 2021 WL 5630400...   \n \n \nway to a gender-neutral bathroom, knowing every other boy is permitted to use it but him.” Doc. 192, at 27. The district court \nfound that Adams “suffered emotional damage, stigmatization and shame from not being permitted to use the boys’ restroom \nat school.” Doc. 192, at 67-68. Such harm is similar to that suffered by transgender students in other cases in which courts \nhave found a Title IX violation. See Grimm, 972 F.3d at 600-601; Whitaker by Whitaker v. Kenosha Unified Sch. Dist. No. 1 \nBd. of Educ., 858 F.3d 1034, 1045-1046 (7th Cir. 2017); Dodds v. United States Dep’t of Educ., 845 F.3d 217, 221 (6th Cir. \n2016); cf. Doe v. Boyertown Area Sch. Dist., 897 F.3d 518, 523 (3d Cir. 2018) (contrasting harm suffered by transgender \nstudents excluded from restrooms aligned with their gender identity, in rejecting Title IX claims brought by cisgender \nstudents). \n  \nThe School Board insists, however, that excluding Adams from the boys’ restrooms does not violate Title IX because the \nstatute’s implementing regulations “permit the School Board to separate bathrooms on the basis of biological sex.” Br. 24 \n(citing 34 C.F.R. 106.33).7 As the School Board acknowledges, neither *25 Title IX nor its implementing regulations contain \na definition of “sex.” Br. 22. But regardless of how “sex” is defined, Section 106.33 does not give the School Board free rein \nto exclude Adams from the boys’ restrooms. The regulation is not a statutory exemption, or “safe harbor,” as the School \nBoard terms it. Br. 24-25. Rather, it is a regulation that merely clarifies “that the act of creating sex-separated restrooms in \nand of itself” does not violate Title IX. Grimm, 972 F.3d at 618. This is, again, because requiring cisgender boys to use the \nboys’ restrooms or cisgender girls to use the girls’ restrooms does not generally injure those students. Far from “affect [ing] \ntransgender and cisgender students in the same way” (Br. 12), the School Board’s insistence on excluding Adams from the \nboys’ restrooms caused him to suffer significant harm that is not similarly inflicted on cisgender students. \n  \nFurthermore, the School Board treated Adams “worse than others who are similarly situated.” Bostock, 140 S. Ct. at 1740. As \ndiscussed above, Adams is similarly situated to cisgender boys for purposes of using the private stalls in his high school’s \ncommunal restrooms. Thus, “[w]hen it comes to his use of the bathroom, the law requires that he be treated like any other \nboy.” Doc. 192, at 3; see also Grimm, 972 F.3d at 618 (holding that similar policy violated Title IX because “[u]nlike the \nother boys, [plaintiff] had to use either the girls restroom or a single-stall option”). By prohibiting Adams from using the \nboys’ restroom, the *26 School Board treated him worse than similarly-situated students, in violation of Title IX.8 \n  \nB. That Title IX Was Enacted Under The Spending Clause Does Not Immunize The School Board From Liability Under \nThe Statute \nThat Congress passed Title IX under the Spending Clause does not undermine this analysis. The School Board argues that the \nCourt must resolve any ambiguities regarding the term “sex” in Title IX in its favor because federal-funding recipients must \nbe informed of the terms to which they are agreeing when accepting such funding. Br. 26-27 (citing Pennhurst State Sch. & \nHosp. v. Halderman, 451 U.S. 1, 17 (1981)). The School Board forfeited this argument by failing to raise it below. See \nHurley v. Moore, 233 F.3d 1295, 1297 (11th Cir. 2000). In any event, it fails on the merits. \n  \nRecipients of federal financial assistance are on notice that they must comply with Title IX’s nondiscrimination requirement, \nand “the possibility that application of [the condition] might be unclear in [some] contexts” does not render it unenforceable \nunder the Spending Clause. *27 Bennett v. Kentucky Dep’t of Educ., 470 U.S. 656, 665-666, 673 (1985). Unlike Pennhurst, \nwhere the federal law at issue was unclear regarding whether the States incurred any obligations at all by accepting federal \nfunds, Title IX unambiguously conditions receipt of funds on complying with its prohibition on sex discrimination. 20 U.S.C. \n1681(a); see School Bd. of Nassau Cnty., Fla. v. Arline, 480 U.S. 273, 286 n.15 (1987) (contrasting the issue in Pennhurst \nwith the antidiscrimination mandate of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act). “[S]o long as a spending condition has a clear \nand actionable prohibition of discrimination, it does not matter that the manner of that discrimination can vary widely.” \nBenning v. Georgia, 391 F.3d 1299, 1306 (11th Cir. 2004). Here, Title IX’s condition barring discrimination “on the basis of \nsex” is not one of which the School Board is “unaware” or “unable to ascertain.” Arlington Cent. Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ. v. \nMurphy, 548 U.S. 291, 296 (2006) (quoting Pennhurst, 451 U.S. at 17).9 \n  \nBut in any case, the Court need not determine the meaning of “sex” in Title IX or its implementing regulations or whether the \nterm is ambiguous. Regardless of how sex is defined, the School Board may not apply its bathroom policy to an individual \n12 \n \n\n \n \nDrew ADAMS, Plaintiff-Appellee, v. SCHOOL BOARD OF..., 2021 WL 5630400...   \n \n \nstudent in a way that harmfully discriminates against him or deprives *28 him of access to equal educational opportunities. \nThe regulation clarifies that treating the sexes differently by providing separate restrooms is not itself discriminatory; it does \nnot endorse applying the statute in a way that treats Adams differently because his sex assigned at birth differs from his sex at \nthe time he uses the school restroom and thereby causes him harm. See Bostock, 140 S. Ct. at 1746 (“By discriminating \nagainst transgender persons, the employer unavoidably discriminates against persons with one sex identified at birth and \nanother today.”). Thus, regardless of how sex is defined, the Court should reject the School Board’s Spending Clause \nargument. \n  \nIn sum, by excluding Adams from the boys’ restrooms, the School Board discriminated against him on the basis of his sex, in \nviolation of Title IX. \n  \n*29 CONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, this Court should affirm. \n  \nRespectfully submitted, \n  \nKRISTEN CLARKE \n  \nAssistant Attorney General \n  \ns/ Elizabeth P.

SCHOOL BOARD OF..., 2021 WL 5630400...   \n \n \n \n2  The district court defined a “transgender individual” as “someone who ‘consistently, persistently, and insistently’ \n  identifies as a gender different than the sex they were assigned at birth.” Doc. 192, at 7. \n \n3  The Guidelines do not define the term “biological sex.” Doc. 103-1. \n \n \n4  As stated above, the district court rejected the School Board’s argument that excluding Adams from the boys’ \n  restrooms also advanced student safety. Doc. 192, at 41-43. The School Board has not reasserted that argument in its \nen banc brief. \n \n5  Indeed, courts have rejected privacy-based challenges brought by cisgender students objecting to sharing restrooms \n  with transgender students. See Parents for Privacy v. Barr, 949 F.3d 1210, 1217 (9th Cir.) (“[T]here is no Fourteenth \nAmendment fundamental privacy right to avoid all risk of intimate exposure to or by a transgender person who was \nassigned the opposite biological sex at birth.”), cert. denied, 141 S. Ct. 894 (2020); see also Boyertown, 897 F.3d at \n535. \n \n6  The School Board’s argument (Br. 19-20) that courts must defer to school officials “in considering whether policy \n  decisions  contravene  students’  constitutional  rights”  is  meritless.  Although  courts  have  found  that  students’ \nFourteenth Amendment due process rights may be different in public schools, the same cannot be said for students’ \nequal protection rights. On the contrary, the Supreme Court has recognized that judicial deference to school boards \n“is fundamentally at odds with our equal protection jurisprudence.” Parents Involved in Cmty. Schs. v. Seattle Sch. \nDist. No. 1, 551 U.S. 701, 744 (2007); see also West Va. Bd. of Educ. v. Barnette, 319 U.S. 624, 637 (1943) (“The \nFourteenth Amendment * * * protects the citizen against the State itself and all of its creatures--Boards of Education \nnot excepted.”). \n \n7  The School Board also invokes Title IX and its implementing regulations’ allowance for sex-separated living \n  facilities, locker rooms, and shower facilities. Br. 22 (citing 20 U.S.C. 1686; 34 C.F.R. 106.33). This case does not \ninvolve residential facilities or use of communal locker rooms or showers. Consideration of Title IX’s application to \ntransgender students in these settings should be reserved for cases presenting the question. \n \n8  For the same reasons, the School Board did not avoid violating Title IX by permitting Adams to use a gender-neutral \n  restroom, when all other students are permitted to use sex-segregated restrooms. Courts have held that such a \nrequirement “would very publicly brand all transgender students with a scarlet ‘T,’ and they should not have to \nendure that as the price of attending their public school.” Boyertown, 897 F.3d at 530; see also Grimm, 972 F.3d at \n618; Whitaker, 858 F.3d at 1045-1046. \n \n9  In addition to Murphy, the School Board cites Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U.S. 452, 469-470 (1991), which did not \n  involve Spending Clause legislation, and Dellmuth v. Muth, 491 U.S. 223, 232 (1989), which involved Eleventh \n14 \n \n\n \n \nDrew ADAMS, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.

Introduction \n  Co-Defendants  Superintendent  and  Principal  file  this  Motion  to  succinctly \naddress two narrow issues – both of which mandate dismissal of the claims against \nthem.  In the event the Court does not dismiss the Superintendent and Principal with \nprejudice based upon the arguments set forth below, pursuant to Rule 10(c) of the \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure, the Superintendent and Principal adopt the positions \nthe School Board will take in its separately, subsequently filed defensive motions and \nresponses to the request for preliminary injunctive relief. \nII.  Argument  and  Authority  –  Plaintiff’s  Claims  Against  The  “Office  of \nSuperintendent” and “Office of Principal” Are Redundant \n \nSeveral Federal district courts, both in and outside the State of Florida, have \nheld that suing both the school board and other school district officials in their official \ncapacities is unnecessary and redundant.   Kubany by Kubany v. School Bd. of \nPinellas County, 818 F. Supp 1504, 1507 (M.D. Fla. 1993) (filing a Section 1983 claim \nagainst school board members and principal in their official capacities was improper, \nbecause  the  plaintiff  had  sued  the  school  board  directly);  see  also,  Marshall  v. \nMiller, 873 F.Supp. 628, 632 (M.D. Fla. 1995) (citing Yeldell v. Cooper Green Hosp., \nInc., 956 F.2d 1056,1060 (M.D. Fla. 1995)) (noting that official capacity claims are \nsuperfluous where, “only the assets of the government are available to satisfy a \nplaintiff’s claims.”)); Garrett v. Clarke County Bd. of Education, 857 F. Supp. 949, 952 \n(S.D. Ala. 1994) (dismissing with prejudice all of plaintiffs’ Section 1983 claims against \nsuperintendent where plaintiff also sued the school board directly); Moss v. W & A \nCleaners, 111 F.Supp.2d 1181, 1187 (M.D. Ala. 2000) (noting that an official capacity \n2 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00739-TJC-JBT   Document 34   Filed 08/01/17   Page 3 of 9 PageID 904\nsuit is unnecessary where a plaintiff has also named the employer as a party); Lynn \nv. United Technologies Corp., Inc., 916 F.Supp. 1217, 1219 (M.D. Ala. 1996) (holding \nthat an official capacity suit is unnecessary and duplicative when an employer is \nproperly named as a defendant).1   \nIn Johnson v. Dade County Public Schools, 1992 WL 466902 at *3 (S.D. Fla. \n1992), the plaintiffs brought suit against both the Dade County School Board and the \nsuperintendent in his official capacity. Although the plaintiffs there asserted that the \nsuperintendent was an indispensable party to the action, the court held that suing the \ngovernmental entity, the school board, and an officer of that entity in the officer’s \nofficial capacity is “superfluous.”  See also, Hicks ex rel. Hicks v. Halifax County Bd. \nof Ed., 93 F. Supp. 2d 649, 667 (E.D.N.C. 1999)(following Monell and Graham and \nholding that counts that were filed against school board and against superintendent \nand principal of school in their official capacities should be dismissed, finding that “[i]t \nis  unnecessary  for  plaintiff  to  proceed  against  both  the  officials  in  their  official \ncapacities and the School Board under Kentucky [v. Graham] and Monell”); Love-Lane \nv. Martin, 201 F. Supp. 2d 566, 583 (M.D.N.C. 2002), aff’d in part, vacated in part on \nother grounds, 355 F.3d 766 (4th Cir. 2004) (“Because Plaintiff has also asserted \n                                                           \n1 Cases from outside the Eleventh Circuit reaching the same conclusion include: Scott \nv. Flowers, 910 F.2d 201, 213, n. 25 (5th Cir. 1990) (rejecting that co-defendants \nemployees were responsible for Section 1988 attorney fees where the injunctive relief \nsought by plaintiff could only be obtained through the employer); McLin v. City of \nChicago, 742 F.Supp. 994, 997 (N.D. Ill. 1990) (dismissing official capacity suit against \ndefendants  did  not  prejudice  plaintiff’s  claim  against  the  city  but  streamlined \nthem); Willis v. Bell, 726 F.Supp. 1118, 1124 (N.D. Ill. 1989), aff'd, 999 F.2d 284 \n(7th Cir.  1993), cert.  denied, 114  S.Ct.  897  (1994)  (claim  against  police \nsuperintendent in official capacity was redundant and dismissed). \n3 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00739-TJC-JBT   Document 34   Filed 08/01/17   Page 4 of 9 PageID 905\nclaims against the school district by suing the Board, the claims against Martin in his \nofficial capacity are redundant with those claims and will be dismissed.”).  \nThese  cases  recognize  a  longstanding  doctrine  of  the  Supreme  Court \napplicable  to  governmental  liability  lawsuits,  and,  in  particular,  in  Section  1983 \nlitigation, that an “official capacity” suit is merely an alternative way of pleading an \naction against the entity of which the government official is an agent.  Kentucky v. \nGraham, 473 U.S. 159, 165-66, 167 n. 14 (1985) (quoting Monell, 436 U.S. at 690 n. \n55); Busby v. City of Orlando, 931 F.2d 764, 772 (11th Cir. 1991) (following Kentucky \nv. Graham).2  These cases also reflect the reality that neither the Superintendent nor \nthe Principal are necessary parties for purposes of effectuating relief. Indeed, should \nthis Court determine that Plaintiff’s claims are meritorious, an order enjoining or \nrequiring the School Board to refrain from or take certain action would be effective \nacross the entire school district. \nSuing the School Board, the Superintendent and the Principal in this case was \nunnecessary overkill. Because Plaintiff has sued the School Board directly, the official \ncapacity  claims  against  the  Superintendent  and  Principal  are  redundant  and \nunnecessary and should be dismissed with prejudice.   \n                                                           \n2 Monell v. New York City Dept. of Social Services, 436 U.S. 658, 691 n. 55 (1978) \nmade it clear that a suit against a local government official in his official capacity is \ntreated as a suit against the local government unit. The Court reiterated this concept \nin Graham, explaining that there “is no longer a need to bring official-capacity actions \nagainst local government officials ... [because] local government units can be sued \ndirectly for damages and injunctive or declaratory relief.” Graham, 473 U.S. at 167, n. \n14. \n \n4 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00739-TJC-JBT   Document 34   Filed 08/01/17   Page 5 of 9 PageID 906\nIII.  Argument and Authority - Plaintiff May Not Maintain Any Claims Against \nThe “Office of Superintendent” and “Office of Principal” Under Monell \n \nPlaintiff has brought this suit against the School Board for St. Johns County, \nthe Superintendent, Tim Forson, in his official capacity and the Principal of Nease \nHigh School in her official capacity, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983.  (Doc. 1 at p. 4, ¶ \n8).  However, Plaintiff is barred from pursuing any claims against the Co-Defendants \nSuperintendent and Principal under the municipal liability standard established by the \nUnited States Supreme Court in Monell. \nIn Monell, the Court held that municipalities, including local government bodies \nsuch  as  school  boards,  may  be  held  liable  under  42  U.S.C.  §1983  for  an \nunconstitutional action committed by one of its officers only when the challenged act \ncan fairly be stated to represent official policy or custom. Id. at 694 (1978); see also, \nDenno v. Sch. Bd. of Volusia County, 218 F.3d 1267, 1276 n. 9 (11th Cir. 2000) \n(finding that school boards are local government entities for Monell liability purposes).  \nAt the same time, the court also held that municipalities cannot be found liable based \non a theory of respondeat superior. As such, the court set a clear line of demarcation \nbetween  acts  of  the  municipality  itself  (for  which  there  is  liability)  and  acts  of \nemployees of the municipality (for which there is no liability), and limited municipal \nliability to actions for which it is actually responsible. Id. at 694. In so holding, the court \nnoted: “[i]t is when execution of a government’s policy or custom, whether made by its \nlawmakers or by those whose edicts or acts may fairly be said to represent official \npolicy, inflicts the injury that the government as an entity is responsible under § 1983.”  \nId.  Thus, “municipal liability attaches where, and only where, a deliberate choice to \n5 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00739-TJC-JBT   Document 34   Filed 08/01/17   Page 6 of 9 PageID 907\nfollow a course of action is made from among various alternatives” by the final policy-\nmaker  which  resulted  in  the  deprivation  of  Plaintiff’s  rights.  Pembaur  v.  City  of \nCincinnati, 475 U.S. 469, 483 (1986); see also, Jett v. Dallas Indep. Sch. Dist., 491 \nU.S. 701, 737 (1989); City of St. Louis v. Praprotnik, 485 U.S. 112, 123 (1988).    \nIn the case sub judice, Plaintiff seeks to attack the School Board’s policy of \nrequiring students to use the bathroom of their biological sex. (Doc. 1 at p. 19, ¶66).  \nThe Superintendent and Principal are not the final policymakers for the St. Johns \nCounty School District as a matter of law. Plaintiff even expressly acknowledges this \nin the Complaint. (Doc. 1 at p. 19, ¶68).  Accordingly, Plaintiff’s claims against the \nOffice of Superintendent and the Office of the Principal of Nease High School must be \ndismissed with prejudice.  \nIn determining whether a municipal official is a final policymaker under Monell, \na  district  court  must  apply  state  law  and  identify  those  who  speak  with  final \npolicymaking authority for the local governmental actor with respect to the action \nalleged to have caused the particular constitutional or statutory violation at issue.  \nPraprotnik, 485 U.S. at 123; Jett, 491 U.S. at 737; see also, Maschmeier v. Scott, 269 \nFed.  Appx.  941,  943  (11th  Cir.  2008)(noting  that  a  lack  of  policy  maker  status \nprecludes an official capacity suit).  Only after the final policymaker is identified can it \nbe determined whether its/their decision caused the alleged deprivation of rights at \nissue by and through policies which affirmatively command that the deprivation occur.  \nId.; see also, Scala v. City of Winter Park, 116 F.3d 1396, 1401 (11th Cir. 1997) \n6 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00739-TJC-JBT   Document 34   Filed 08/01/17   Page 7 of 9 PageID 908\n(establishing  that  a municipal officer is not  a final policymaker when  his or her \ndecisions are subject to meaningful administrative review).     \nUnder Florida law, final policymaking authority for a school district is vested in \nthe School Board.  See, §1001.41, Fla. Stat. (2017). While the Florida Legislature has \nalso vested superintendents with the authority to recommend policies to the School \nBoard, it has simply not given superintendents authority to make final policy without \nthe school board’s approval.  See, §1001.49, Fla. Stat. (2017). The limited power of \nthe superintendent “to recommend” is subject to the broader powers of the school \nboard, which is responsible as a matter of law for determining and implementing \npolicy.  In fact, Florida law does not authorize any employee to make final policy for \nthe Board.  K.M. v. School Board of Lee County, 150 Fed. Appx. 953, 957 (11th Cir. \n2005) (“Under Florida law, final policymaking authority for a school district is vested in \nthe School Board. Fla. Stat. Ann. § 230.22(1) (2001) (now codified at § 1001.41).” See \nalso, Sherrod v. Palm Beach County Sch. Dist., 424 F. Supp. 2d 1341, 1345 (S.D. Fla. \n2006) (holding that the multi-member school board was the final policymaker for the \nschool district rather than the superintendent).  \nBased upon this division of power created by the Florida Legislature, the School \nBoard, and not the Superintendent or the Principal, has final decision-making authority \nwithin the St. Johns County School District, a fact Plaintiff does not dispute. See, \nJohnson, 1992 WL 466902 at *4 (holding that under Florida law, the school board has \nfinal  decision-making  authority,  not  the  superintendent,  and  rejecting  plaintiffs’ \nargument that the superintendent’s purported decision-making authority is such that \n7 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-00739-TJC-JBT   Document 34   Filed 08/01/17   Page 8 of 9 PageID 909\na single decision by him may constitute a “policy” under § 1983). For Monell liability \npurposes, the School Board is the only party against which Plaintiff’s Section 1983 \nclaims may lie. \nIV.  Conclusion \n  Based on the foregoing, it is clear that the claims against the Superintendent \nand Principal should be dismissed from this action with prejudice. \nDated this 1st day of August, 2017.   \nRespectfully submitted, \n/s/ Terry J.
