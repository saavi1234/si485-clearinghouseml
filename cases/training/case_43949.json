Defendant previously filed a motion raising identical arguments (ECF No. 91), which the Court terminated following discussions with the parties during a telephonic status conference on April 10, 2024. As the Court then indicated, and the parties agreed, Defendant can and should raise its arguments in response to a motion for class certification. Such a motion is currently pending, so Defendant's Motion to Strike is DENIED. In accordance with the text-only order issued on July 19, 2024, the Court shall expect a Response from Defendant regarding Plaintiff's Motion for Class Certification and Motion for Consolidation (ECF Nos. 98 & 99) by August 7, 2024. Nothing prevents Defendant from submitting a response sooner if it is prepared to. Signed by District Judge Terrence G. Berg. (TMcg)"

    "summary": "<p>On December 26, 2018, a Black woman filed this putative class action in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan against the Oakland County, the City of Southfield, and various private entities on behalf of herself and similarly situated persons. The plaintiff alleged that the office circumvented Michigan law by improperly transferring her property and property belonging to other Black homeowners to private corporations in violation of their right to procedural due process. These properties, which the plaintiff alleged were disproportionately owned by Black persons, faced tax foreclosures, and the plaintiff argued that these transfers racially discriminated against Black homeowners in violation of the Fair Housing Act. Initially proceeding pro se, but later represented by private counsel, the plaintiff sought injunctive relief against the City&rsquo;s Neighborhood Revitalization Initiative, which evicted her from her home, to prevent further transfers of her property. She also sought punitive and compensatory damages. Judge Terrence G. Berg was assigned to the case.</p>\r\n<p>On February 14, 2019, the plaintiff amended her complaint to include the argument that Oakland County violated her due process rights and equal protection guarantees. She based her argument on the fact that Wayne County allowed its residents to take advantage of a 2015 law that the MI Legislature passed, which gave residents more time to pay off delinquent taxes. Plaintiff contended that the unequal application of the 2015 law violated procedural due process rights and equal protection guarantees in the U.S. Constitution and state analogues.</p>\r\n<p>The defendants filed separate motions to dismiss in March of 2019. Magistrate Judge Michael J. Hluchaniuk issued a report and recommendation on January 9, 2020, supporting dismissal of the plaintiff's claims. Judge Berg accepted the magistrate judge's report and recommendation dismissing the plaintiff's complaint and then stayed the case pending the Sixth Circuit's resolution of a case that would affect the viability of any amended complaint the plaintiff filed arguing violations of the Takings Clause. That case, <em>Freed v. Thomas</em>, concerned whether there were jurisdictional grounds to dismiss a takings claim brought in federal court that did not seek to enjoin an ongoing state court proceeding on the grounds of the Tax Injunction Act, <em>Rooker</em>-<em>Feldman</em>, or comity.</p>\r\n<p><em>Freed</em> ultimately did not affect the disposition of this case, and the plaintiff moved to filed a second amended complaint on May 28, 2021. However, the district court denied that motion on February 28, 2022, reasoning that there was no clear evidence that the government had pocketed surplus value from the foreclosure of the plaintiff's home or that the plaintiff had a property or equity interest in that surplus.</p>\r\n<p>On March 30, 2022, the plaintiff appealed the district court's dismissal of her claims, arguing that she and members of the putative class did have a cognizable property interest. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed in part and vacated in part the district court's dismissal. The appellate court concluded that the plaintiff did have a cognizable equitable property interest and therefore a takings claim that could survive the motion to dismiss stage. As such, the appellate court vacated the district court's denial of the plaintiff's motion to amend to allege federal takings claims against Oakland County; state takings claims against Oakland County and the City of Southfield; and a civil conspiracy claim as to all the defendants. While these claims hinged on the same predicate analysis of a cognizable property interest, others did not. As such, the Sixth Circuit affirmed the district court's dismissal of the plaintiff's original complaint and its claims, in part also because the plaintiff's objections to the magistrate judge's initial report and recommendation were too generalized.</p>\r\n<p>This case remains ongoing. The defendants filed a petition for writ of certiorari with the Supreme Court of the United States on March 14, 2023, docketed at 22-894.</p>",

    "summary_short": "This is a case brought by a Black homeowner on behalf of a putative class of other similarly situated persons alleging that Oakland County, the City of Southfield, and some private entities unlawfully seized her home. Initially filed pro se, the plaintiff argued violations of the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment as well as of the Fair Housing Act. Those claims were dismissed by the district court and later affirmed by the Sixth Circuit. The district court denied the plaintiff's motion to file a second amended complaint alleging variations of claims under the Takings Clauses of the federal and state constitutions, but the Sixth Circuit vacated that decision, reasoning that the plaintiff did have a cognizable equitable property interest in her home. The defendants in the district court have currently filed a petition for writ of certiorari with the Supreme Court of the United States, and this case is ongoing.",

      "text": "UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nEASTERN DISTRICT OF MICHIGAN \nSOUTHERN DIVISION \n   \nMARION SINCLAIR,  2:18-CV-14042-TGB \nPlaintiff,    \n  vs.   ORDER ADOPTING REPORT \nAND RECOMMENDATION \nANDY MEISNER, ET AL.,  \n(DKT. 34); GRANTING \nDefendants.  MOTIONS TO DISMISS (ECF \nNOS. 13, 15, 17); STAYING \nCASE \n \nI.  Report and Recommendation \nThis matter is before the Court on Magistrate Judge Michael J. \nHluchaniuk’s January 9, 2020 Report and Recommendation (ECF No. \n34), recommending that Defendants’ Motions to Dismiss (ECF Nos. 13, \n15, 17) be GRANTED. \nThe  Court  has  reviewed  the  Magistrate  Judge’s  Report  and \nRecommendation. The law provides that either party may serve and file \nwritten objections “[w]ithin fourteen days after being served with a copy” \nof a report and recommendation. 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1).  The district court \nwill make a “de novo determination of those portions of the report . . . to \nwhich objection is made.”  Id.  Where neither party objects to the report, \n\nthe district court is not obligated to independently review the record.  See \nThomas v. Arn, 474 U.S. 140, 149-52 (1985).   \nIn  this  case,  Plaintiff  filed  an  objection  to  the  Report  and \nRecommendation, but did not specifically object to any of the Magistrate \nJudge’s findings.  ECF No. 35.  Instead, Plaintiff requests thirty days to \nfile an amended complaint that would eliminate all but her Fifth, Eighth, \nand Fourteenth Amendment claims.  Id.   \nBecause Plaintiff failed to make any specific objections, the Court \nwill accept the Magistrate’s Report and Recommendation of January 9, \n2020 as this Court’s findings of fact and conclusions of law.  See Cole v. \nYukins, 7 F. App’x 354, 356 (6th Cir. 2001) (“The filing of vague, general, \nor  conclusory  objections  does  not  meet  the  requirement  of  specific \nobjections and is tantamount to a complete failure to object.”). \nII.  Request to Amend the Complaint \nPlaintiff seeks to file an amended complaint containing only Fifth, \nEighth and Fourteenth Amendment claims.  ECF No. 35.  Plaintiff’s \namended complaint would no longer seek injunctive relief or a reversal \nof the foreclosure of her property.  Id. \n2 \n \n\nDefendants contend that the Court should deny Plaintiff leave to \namend because any amended complaint filed by Plaintiff would be futile.  \nSee Foman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178, 182 (1962) (courts may deny leave to \namend when amendment would be futile).  The Defendants filed three \nseparate responses to Plaintiff’s objection, but generally argue that an \namended complaint would be futile because it would still be barred by (i) \nthe Tax Injunction Act; (ii) principles of comity; (iii) and the Rooker-\nFeldman doctrine.  ECF No. 36.  Defendants also assert that even if the \nCourt did have jurisdiction over this matter, Plaintiff’s claim would fail \nbecause there was no surplus equity after Defendants sold Plaintiff’s \nproperty.  ECF No. 36. \nSince Plaintiff filed her Complaint, the Supreme Court issued its \nopinion in Knick v. Township of Scott, 139 S. Ct. 2162, 2168 (2019) and \nthe Michigan Supreme Court heard oral argument in Rafaeli, LLC v. \nOakland County, No. 156849.  Knick fundamentally altered the nature of \na takings claim, holding that the Takings Clause is violated at the time \nthe  government  takes  property  without  first  paying  compensation—\nmeaning that a property owner no longer has to challenge the taking in \nstate court before being legally permitted to raise their takings claim in \n3 \n \n\nfederal court.  139 S. Ct. at 2179.  Whether a post-Knick takings claim \nthat  does  not  seek  to  enjoin  a  state  tax  collection  law  or  reverse  a \nforeclosure is still precluded from review in the lower federal courts by \nthe  Tax  Injunction  Act,  comity,  and  Rooker-Feldman  is  less  clear, \nhowever.  Those questions are currently before the Sixth Circuit in Freed \nv. Thomas, No. 18-2312 (6th Cir.). \nWith regard to their factual argument, Defendants assert in their \nresponses that a takings claim would be futile because there was no \nsurplus after the sale of Plaintiff’s home.  Plaintiff has not yet had the \nopportunity to respond to this factual assertion, however, since it came \nin Defendants’ response to Plaintiff’s objection.  The Court declines to \nfind Plaintiff’s claim futile based on a factual assertion to which Plaintiff \nhas no opportunity to respond.   \nGiven  the  Sixth  Circuit’s  forthcoming  decision  in  Freed,  other \ncourts  in  this  district  facing  the  same  jurisdictional  questions  have \ndeclined to rule until the Freed decision is issued.  See, e.g., Arkona, LLC \nv. Cty. of Cheboygan, No. 1:19-CV-12372, 2020 WL 127774, at *4 (E.D. \nMich. Jan. 10, 2020); Fox v. Cty. of Saginaw by Bd. of Commissioners, No. \n1:19-CV-11887, 2020 WL 133995, at *5 (E.D. Mich. Jan. 10, 2020).  The \n4 \n \n\nCourt finds that the interests of judicial economy counsel in favor of doing \nthe same.  Accordingly, this matter shall be stayed pending the Sixth \nCircuit’s decision in Freed v. Thomas, Case No. 18-2312 (6th Cir.). The \nparties shall file a notice with the Court no later than 30 days after the \nSixth Circuit issues the mandate in that case.  After the issuance of a \nmandate,  Plaintiff  may  file  a  motion  for  leave  to  file  an  amended \ncomplaint. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n5 \n \n\nIII.  Conclusion \nThe Report and Recommendation of January 9, 2020 (ECF No. 34), \nrecommending that Defendants’ Motions to Dismiss (ECF Nos. 13, 15, \n17)  be  granted  is  HEREBY  ACCEPTED  AND  ADOPTED.    The \nComplaint  is  DISMISSED  WITHOUT  PREJUDICE.    IT  IS \nFURTHER ORDERED that this matter is STAYED pending the Sixth \nCircuit’s decision in Freed v. Thomas.  The parties shall file a notice with \nthe Court within 30 days of the Sixth Circuit issuing a mandate.  After \nthe issuance of a mandate, Plaintiff may file a motion for leave to file an \namended complaint. \nDATED this 10th day of March, 2020. \nBY THE COURT: \n/s/Terrence G. Berg   \nTERRENCE G. BERG \nUnited States District Judge \n \n \n6 \n ",

Proposed  Am.  Compl.  ¶  61,  ECF  No.  51-1, \nPageID.825. \nUnderstanding  Plaintiff’s  legal  claims  requires  a  preliminary \ndiscussion of the Michigan General Property Tax Act (“GPTA”). MCL §§ \n211.1-211.157. The GPTA’s purpose is to facilitate the efficient payment \nof property taxes and the efficient return of delinquent properties back to \nthe tax rolls. When relevant municipal authorities determine that taxes \nare past due on a property, the owner of the property faces one of two \nscenarios: (1) the owner is able, within the statutory time limits, to pay \ntheir  back  taxes  and  redeem  their  property,  or  (2)  the  property  is \nforeclosed on and sold, and the property is returned to the tax rolls after \nthe municipality recovers as much as it can in owed taxes and fees.  \nThe  treasurer  of  a  county  can  elect  to  act  as  the  “foreclosing \ngovernment  unit”  or  “FGU”  who  facilitates  the  resolution  of  any \ndelinquent  tax  payments  and  administers  notification  regarding \nredemption opportunities and eventual foreclosure and sale. If the county \n2 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-14042-TGB-MJH   ECF No. 64, PageID.1273   Filed 02/28/22   Page 3 of 18\ntreasurer does not elect to act as the FGU, the state will. However, most \ncounties in Michigan (including Oakland County, where Southfield is \nlocated) have elected to have their treasurer perform this function. MCL \n211.78. \nThe GPTA sets out the procedures and timelines that govern this \nprocess. Each year, property taxes unpaid as of March 1 are identified to \nthe treasurer as delinquent. Once a property becomes delinquent, the \ntreasurer  initiates  a  prescribed  schedule  of  notice  and  hearing \nopportunities over the course of twelve months, giving owners a chance \nto redeem their property. MCL 211.78b-g. If the property is not redeemed \nin that time, it is “forfeited” to the treasurer. This does not affect title, \nbut allows the treasurer to list the property on the tax rolls as forfeited \nand file a petition in circuit court seeking foreclosure. The GPTA also \nincludes notice procedures and requirements regarding this foreclosure \nhearing in circuit court, creating continuing opportunities for redemption \nby the owner. MCL 211.78h. The taxpayer’s right to redeem the property \nexpires on the March 31 immediately following entry of judgment on the \nforeclosure petition (generally falling about two years after the initial \ndelinquency finding). If delinquent taxes are not paid by that date, title \ntransfers to the treasurer. MCL 211.78k(5)-(6). \nDuring the time frame when the events at issue in this lawsuit \noccurred, the statute required that after title transferred to the treasurer, \nthe municipality where the property was located had a right of first \n3 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-14042-TGB-MJH   ECF No. 64, PageID.1274   Filed 02/28/22   Page 4 of 18\nrefusal (“ROFR”) to buy the property for a “minimum bid” equal to the \ndelinquent taxes and any fees owed. See ECF No. 51-1, PageID.819. If \nthe relevant municipality did not exercise its ROFR, the property would \nusually be put up for auction by the treasurer to attempt to recover what \nwas owed. Any monies obtained by the treasurer, either through a ROFR \nsale or through auction, went towards a general fund used to pay off \ndelinquent taxes to municipalities. See generally Rafaeli, LLC v. Oakland \nCty., 952 N.W.2d 434, 443-49 (Mich. 2020) (providing an overview of the \nGPTA framework). 1  \nIn Plaintiff’s case, she fell behind on the property taxes for her home \nin Southfield sometime between 2013-14. Her property forfeited to the \nOakland County Treasurer around June 12, 2015. Proposed Am. Compl. \n¶ 56, ECF No. 51-1. A judgment of foreclosure was entered in Oakland \nCounty Circuit Court on February 2, 2016. Id. at ¶ 57. Plaintiff was not \nable to redeem her property before March 31, 2016, so title vested in the \nOakland County Treasurer. Id. The delinquency on her property was \nreported on the judgment of foreclosure as $22,047.46. Id. at ¶ 58. On \n \n1  The  Michigan  legislature  has  since  amended  the  GPTA  and \nsignificantly modified the post-foreclosure procedure; these changes went \ninto effect for any properties found to be delinquent after January 1, \n2021. Now, municipalities wishing to exercise the right of first refusal on \na foreclosed property must pay the greater of the minimum bid or the fair \nmarket  value  of  the  property.  MCL  211.78m.  The  legislature  has \nspecifically  noted  that  this  provision  is  not  retroactive  unless  the \nMichigan Supreme Court decides it is. MCL 211.78t(1)(b). \n4 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-14042-TGB-MJH   ECF No. 64, PageID.1275   Filed 02/28/22   Page 5 of 18\nJuly 7, 2016, the City of Southfield exercised its ROFR and purchased \nthe property for $28,424.84. On September 22, 2016, the property was \nconveyed to the Southfield Neighborhood Revitalization Initiative, a for-\nprofit limited liability company or LLC, for $1. Id. at ¶ 60.  \nPlaintiff  makes  several  allegations  as  to  how  this  sequence  of \nevents  violated  her  constitutional  rights.  She  is  suing  a  variety  of \nDefendant  actors  that  can  be  separated  into  three  groups:  (1)  the \nOakland  Defendants  (Oakland  County  and  Andy  Meisner,  Oakland \nCounty  Treasurer),  (2)  the  Southfield Public  Defendants  (the  City  of \nSouthfield,  City  Administrator  Frederick  Zorn,  and  Mayor  Kenson \nSiver),  and  (3)  the  Southfield  Private  Defendants  (the  Southfield \nNonprofit  Housing  Corporation  or  “SNHC”  and  the  Southfield \nNeighborhood Revitalization Initiative or “SNRI”).2  \nFirst, Plaintiff alleges that because Southfield paid more for her \nproperty  than  her  actual  delinquency,  Oakland  County  received  a \nsurplus of funds when it sold her home, which should be paid out to her. \nSecond, and more centrally, she alleges the various Southfield Public and \nPrivate  Defendants  are  involved  in  a  “scheme”  to  deprive  certain \nhomeowners of their properties at low prices so that they can “flip” them \nand  make  a  profit  on  them,  without  compensating  the  owners.  The \n \n2 Plaintiff indicates that any other Defendants previously named in the \nlawsuit  would  not  be  included  in  the  proposed  Second  Amended \nComplaint. ECF No. 51, PageID.805.\n \n5 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-14042-TGB-MJH   ECF No. 64, PageID.1276   Filed 02/28/22   Page 6 of 18\nalleged scheme goes like this: the non-profit SNHC funds Southfield’s \npurchase of these properties through the ROFR process; then, Southfield \nsells the properties to the for-profit SNRI for the minimal consideration \nof $1; eventually, SNRI sells them for a much larger profit.3 SNRI is \nalleged  to  have  been  incorporated  in  2016  with  the  blessing  and \nknowledge of Southfield city administrators for the sole purpose of acting \nas the “receiving” entity for these properties. By selling the forfeited \nproperty,  SNRI  realizes  any  “equity”  in  the  property,4  alternatively \ncharacterized  as  its  fair  market  value  or  the  difference  between  the \ndelinquency and whatever profit that is eventually made from the sale. \nThe dollar value of that equity, under this system, is never returned to \nthe original homeowner. See ¶¶ 34-45, ECF No. 51-1.  \nPlaintiff asserts in her proposed Second Amended Complaint that \nthe post-foreclosure sales of her property to Southfield and then to SNRI \nconstituted an illegal taking in violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth \nAmendments and Article X, Section 2 of the Michigan Constitution, and \nthat  they  involved  procedural  due  process  violations  under  the \n \n3  Although  the  above  chain  of  events  describes  the  typical  “scheme” \naccording to Plaintiff, and this type of sale has occurred in other, similar \nlawsuits brought in this District, in our case the record does not indicate \nwhether SNRI has yet re-sold Plaintiff’s house or otherwise made any \nprofit on it. \n4  Plaintiff  alleges  that  SNRI  is  “controlled  in  large  part  by  City  of \nSouthfield officials,” implying that Southfield also receives some benefits \nfrom SNRI’s activities. ¶ 5, ECF No. 51-1. \n6 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-14042-TGB-MJH   ECF No. 64, PageID.1277   Filed 02/28/22   Page 7 of 18\nFourteenth Amendment. She also brings claims of unjust enrichment and \ncivil conspiracy. The Court issued a consolidated briefing schedule in \nresponse to the instant motion, which all Parties timely followed, and \nthen  heard  oral  argument  on  January  5,  2022.  In  addition  to  the \nanticipated briefing, Plaintiff also filed a supplemental brief related to \nthe issue of whether Oakland County truly received a surplus payment, \nto which the Southfield Public Defendants filed a response and Plaintiff \nfiled a reply. ECF Nos. 59, 60, 61. These issues are now ripe for review. \nII.  STANDARD OF REVIEW \n The decision to grant or deny a motion to amend is within the \nsound discretion of the Court. See Robinson v. Michigan Consol. Gas Co., \nInc., 918 F.2d 579, 591 (6th Cir. 1990). A party may amend a pleading \nafter the opposing party's responsive pleading has been filed only by \nleave of court or by written consent of the adverse party. Fed. R. Civ. P. \n15(a)(2). Rule 15(a) provides that “leave shall be freely given when justice \nso  requires.”  Id.  However,  amendments  should  not  be  permitted  in \ninstances of “undue delay in filing, lack of notice to the opposing party, \nbad faith by the moving party, repeated failure to cure deficiencies by \nprevious  amendments,  undue  prejudice  to  the  opposing  party,  and \nfutility of amendment.” Foman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178, 182 (1962).  \nThe Sixth Circuit has held that amendment is futile if a proposed \namended complaint would not survive a motion to dismiss. Neighborhood \nDev. Corp. v. Advisory Council on Historic Pres., 632 F.2d 21, 23 (6th Cir. \n7 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-14042-TGB-MJH   ECF No. 64, PageID.1278   Filed 02/28/22   Page 8 of 18\n1980). In evaluating whether a complaint would survive a motion to \ndismiss, courts “must construe the complaint in the light most favorable \nto  the  plaintiff,  accept  all  well-pled  factual  allegations  as  true  and \ndetermine whether the plaintiff undoubtedly can prove no set of facts \nconsistent  with  their  allegations  that  would  entitle  them  to  relief.” \nLeague of United Latin Am. Citizens v. Bredesen, 500 F.3d 523, 527 (6th \nCir. 2007) (citing Kottmyer v. Maas, 436 F.3d 684, 688 (6th Cir. 2006)).  \nThough this standard is liberal, it requires a plaintiff to provide \n“more  than  labels  and  conclusions,  and  a  formulaic  recitation  of  the \nelements of a cause of action” in support of her grounds for entitlement \nto relief. Albrecht v. Treon, 617 F.3d 890, 893 (6th Cir. 2010) (quoting Bell \nAtl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 554, 555 (2007)). Under Ashcroft v. Iqbal, \nthe plaintiff must also plead “factual content that allows the court to \ndraw  the  reasonable  inference  that  the  defendant  is  liable  for  the \nmisconduct  alleged.”  556  U.S.  662,  678  (2009)  (citation  omitted).  A \nplaintiff  falls  short  if  she  pleads  facts  “merely  consistent  with  a \ndefendant’s liability” or if the alleged facts do not “permit the court to \ninfer more than the mere possibility of misconduct.” Albrecht, 617 F.3d \nat 893 (quoting Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678-79). \nIII.  ANALYSIS \nA. The Rafaeli decision \nAn analysis of Plaintiff’s claims first requires some discussion of the \nMichigan Supreme Court’s recent decision in Rafaeli, LLC v. Oakland \n8 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-14042-TGB-MJH   ECF No. 64, PageID.1279   Filed 02/28/22   Page 9 of 18\nCty., where the Court engaged in a thorough review of the GPTA and the \nproperty rights that it conveys. 952 N.W.2d 434 (Mich. 2020). \nThe plaintiffs in Rafaeli were former homeowners whose properties \nwere foreclosed on, under the operation of the provisions of the pre-2021 \nGPTA. The properties were not bought by a municipality through the \nROFR, but were instead sold at auction. The proceeds at auction were \noften significantly greater than the amount of back taxes owed to the \nstate. Id. at 438-39 (noting that although the plaintiff’s delinquency at \nthe time of foreclosure was $285.81, his property was eventually sold at \nauction  for  $24,500).  Plaintiffs  challenged  the  Oakland  County \nTreasurer’s  practice  of  keeping  those  surplus  funds,  rather  than \nreturning them to the original property owner, as an unconstitutional \ntaking.  \nThe  Michigan  Supreme  Court  held  that  the  County’s  failure  to \nreturn the surplus from the sale to the original property owners was in \nfact an unconstitutional taking under the Michigan Constitution. Id. at \n466.  After  recognizing  that  the  GPTA  does  not  specifically  identify \nwhether  taxpayers  have  a  property  interest  in  the  surplus  of  any \nproceeds  from  a  foreclosure  sale,  the  Court  engaged  in  an  extensive \ncommon-law  analysis  and  found  that  “an  owner  of  real  or  personal \nproperty has a right to any surplus proceeds that remain after property \nis sold to satisfy a tax debt. Just as the Magna Carta protected property \nowners  from  uncompensated  takings,  it  also  recognized  that  tax \n9 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-14042-TGB-MJH   ECF No. 64, PageID.1280   Filed 02/28/22   Page 10 of 18\ncollectors could only seize property to satisfy the value of the debt payable \nto the Crown, leaving the property owner with the excess.” Id. at 454-55. \nThis right continues even after title transfers from the property owner to \nthe treasurer: “[i]n the same way that the foreclosure process does not \neliminate the former property owner’s interest in the personal property \nthat sits on the foreclosed land, the vesting of fee simple title to the real \nproperty does not extinguish the property owner’s right to collect the \nsurplus proceeds of the sale.” Id. at 461. \nB. Counts I and II—takings claims \nLike the plaintiffs in Rafaeli, Ms. Sinclair seeks to bring a state \ninverse condemnation claim under Article X, Section 2 of the Michigan \nConstitution. She also brings a federal takings claim under 42 U.S.C. § \n1983. ECF No. 51-1, PageID.829-32. To make out a federal takings claim, \na plaintiff must (1) show a cognizable property interest and (2) show that \na taking occurred. While the Constitution protects property interests, it \ndoes not create them: state, federal, and common law are the source of \nthese interests. Coal. for Gov't Procurement v. Fed. Prison Indus., Inc., \n365 F.3d 435, 481 (6th Cir. 2004). Although the Michigan Constitution is \ngenerally  more  protective  of  property  rights  than  the  federal \nConstitution, a similar analysis applies. Rafaeli, 952 N.W.2d at 449-50. \nTherefore,  as  a  threshold  matter,  Sinclair  must  allege  a  “cognizable \nproperty interest” for any takings claims to have merit. \n10 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-14042-TGB-MJH   ECF No. 64, PageID.1281   Filed 02/28/22   Page 11 of 18\nAs  noted,  Sinclair  alleges  facts  supporting  two  theories  for  her \ntakings claim. The first is that the Oakland County Treasurer received a \nsmall surplus of funds when it sold her property: an amount slightly in \nexcess of the delinquent taxes and fees. Under the decision in Rafaeli, the \ntreasurer’s retention of that excess amount is an unconstitutional taking. \nThe second theory is that the combined actions of Oakland County and \nSouthfield have deprived her of a property interest as related to the \nequity in her property, because the actual value of her house was much \nmore than just the tax delinquency. She alleges that her property should \nhave been sold for its “fair market value” with any surplus proceeds over \nthe tax delinquency returned to her, and that Oakland County’s failure \nto do so is a taking without just compensation. \n1. Surplus theory \nPlaintiff  is  correct  that  according  to  the  holding  of  Rafaeli,  if \nOakland County were to sell her house, receive an amount in excess of \nthe tax delinquency owed, and fail to return it to her, this would be an \nunconstitutional taking. As evidence that Oakland received a surplus, \nshe points to the fact that the dollar figure listed on the judgment of \nforeclosure for her house ($22,047.46) is less than the amount Southfield \neventually paid for her house ($28,424.84). See generally ECF No. 59. But \nin emails included as exhibits to Plaintiff’s briefing and at oral argument, \ncounsel for the Oakland Defendants explained that the dollar figure on \nthe foreclosure judgment was missing several years of delinquent taxes \n11 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-14042-TGB-MJH   ECF No. 64, PageID.1282   Filed 02/28/22   Page 12 of 18\non it and that the amount Southfield eventually paid exactly equals the \namount  that  was  owed  on  the  property.  ECF  No.  59-1.  Defendants \nprovided evidence of the delinquencies from each year that Plaintiff did \nnot pay taxes, and those figures add up to $28,424.84. Id. Given this \nexplanation for the discrepancy, the Court finds that Plaintiff has not \nshown more than a “mere possibility of misconduct” on the part of the \nOakland Defendants. If they did not in fact retain a surplus from the sale, \nPlaintiff’s takings claim under this theory would not survive a motion to \ndismiss. \n2. Equity theory  \nPlaintiff’s  second  argument  is  that  her  “cognizable  property \ninterest” was not just in any surplus proceeds, but in the fair market \nvalue or equity of her home. A similar argument was advanced by the \nplaintiffs in Rafaeli, but the Michigan Supreme Court clearly defined the \nproperty interest it was recognizing as the “surplus proceeds” paid to the \ntreasurer as a result of the sale by auction, and only that. 952 N.W.2d at \nn.134  (holding  that  “the  property  improperly  taken  was  the  surplus \nproceeds,  not  plaintiffs’  real  properties,”  and  stating  that  “we  are \nunaware of any authority affirming a vested property right to equity held \nin property generally.”). So the problem with Plaintiff’s argument is that \nit advances a theory that was explicitly not recognized by the majority \nopinion  in  Rafaeli.  Plaintiff  does  find  support  for  her  theory  in  the \nconcurring opinion of Justice Viviano (“I conclude that the property right \n12 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-14042-TGB-MJH   ECF No. 64, PageID.1283   Filed 02/28/22   Page 13 of 18\nthat has been taken from the plaintiffs is their equity in their respective \nproperties and not any independent interest in the surplus proceeds from \nthe tax-foreclosure sale.”), id. at 467, but this theory was not adopted by \nthe majority, which stated that the Court was “unaware of any authority \naffirming a vested property right to equity held in property generally.” \nPlaintiff’s theory was not the holding of the case, and the fact that the \nmajority did not follow Justice Viviano suggests that Plaintiff’s theory is \nnot  consistent  with  Rafaeli.  Additionally,  post-Rafaeli,  courts  in  this \ndistrict have uniformly interpreted that case as foreclosing the “equity as \na cognizable property interest” argument. See Hall v. Meisner, No. 20-\n12230, 2021 WL 4522300, at *10 (E.D. Mich. Oct. 4, 2021) (Borman, J.); \nFreed v. Thomas, No. 17-CV-13519, 2021 WL 942077, at *4 (E.D. Mich. \nFeb. 26, 2021) (Friedman, J.); Est. of Johnson v. Meisner, No. 19-11569, \n2021 WL 3680479, at *4-5 (E.D. Mich. Aug. 18, 2021) (Tarnow, J.).  \nPlaintiff  argues  that  there  are  factual  differences  between  the \ncases. It is true that the “equity” argument in Rafaeli was not the main \nissue under consideration. In that case the State directly received the \nsurplus in proceeds—in which the Court recognized that the original \nproperty owner had a clear property interest. The question of whether \nthere is also a property interest in “equity” arose when the Rafaeli Court \ndiscussed what just compensation should be available to the plaintiffs as \na remedy for the unconstitutional taking they suffered. But in making \nthis determination, the Court stated that just compensation is only due \n13 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-14042-TGB-MJH   ECF No. 64, PageID.1284   Filed 02/28/22   Page 14 of 18\nfor “property taken.” That compensation was subsequently calculated to \nbe only the surplus proceeds. 952 N.W.2d at 465. The Michigan Supreme \nCourt was not confronted with a case like this one, where the state did \nnot  receive  any  surplus  in  proceeds  but  where  the  state’s  procedure \nnonetheless deprived the homeowner of any equity or fair market value \nthat might be left in the property after the delinquency was paid. But the \n“just  compensation”  analysis  from  Rafaeli  strongly  suggests  that  the \nMichigan  Supreme  Court  would  not  accept  Plaintiff’s  argument  that \nthere is a vested property interest in equity generally.  \nThe Court acknowledges the concerns raised by Justice Viviano’s \nconcurring opinion, which questions the logic of the majority’s conclusion \nthat homeowners have a property right in surplus proceeds, but not in \nequity. Most homeowners would probably find the concept that they do \nnot  have  any  property  interest  in  the  equity  of  their  homes  to  be \nconfusing and counterintuitive. The Rafaeli holding also leads to the \nstrange situation where Ms. Sinclair could have recognized some value \nout of her property if it had sold at auction for more than the amount of \nher delinquency; however, because Southfield bought her house through \nits ROFR for the amount of the delinquency, and sold it to a for-profit \nentity which could then resell it and realize the value of the home’s \nequity, Ms. Sinclair will get nothing. A property interest in “surplus \nproceeds” only arises if, in the process of a sale, a surplus is generated. \nAs Justice Viviano noted in concurrence, by limiting the property interest \n14 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-14042-TGB-MJH   ECF No. 64, PageID.1285   Filed 02/28/22   Page 15 of 18\nin this way, the framework provided by the majority opinion “does not \nconsider the property interests that exist before the sale.” 952 N.W.2d \n434, 474 (2020) (Viviano, J., concurring).  \nIn  response  to  Rafaeli,  the  Michigan  Legislature  amended  the \nGPTA so that state or municipal entities seeking to exercise a ROFR \nmust pay the greater of the delinquency on the property or the property’s \nfair market value. If the ROFR sale is made at the fair market value, the \ntreasurer must turn over any amount of the sales price in excess of the \ndelinquent taxes to the former property owner. MCL 211.78m(1). This \naction  by  the  legislature  does  appear  to  be  directed  toward  allowing \nformer property owners to realize the equity in their homes, even if they \nare lost to foreclosure. However, the sales described in this case were \nlawful  at  the  time  of  the  forfeiture  of  Plaintiff’s  property,  and  as \ndiscussed, the argument she advances in support of an unconstitutional \ntaking  has  not  been  accepted  by  the  Michigan  Supreme  Court.  The \nCourt’s ruling in this case therefore reflects its best interpretation of how \nthe Michigan Supreme Court would rule if the question were before it. \nThe Court finds that neither of Plaintiff’s takings claims would \nsurvive a motion to dismiss, making amendment futile.  \nC. Count III—procedural due process \nPlaintiff  also  makes  a  due  process  claim  against  Oakland  and \nSouthfield,  alleging  that  she  and  the  proposed  class  members  were \ndeprived of due process as related to their property interest in equity. \n15 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-14042-TGB-MJH   ECF No. 64, PageID.1286   Filed 02/28/22   Page 16 of 18\nImportantly, Plaintiff is not challenging any of the procedure or process \nleading up to the foreclosure on her property. Rather, she alleges she was \nunconstitutionally  denied  her  equity—the  fair  market  value  of  her \nhome—because post-foreclosure, there was no process in place for her to \nredeem any excess funds if Oakland or a subsequent buyer (such as SNRI \nhere) ended up paying that fair market value for her property. ¶¶ 93-98, \nECF No. 51-1. But there must be an identifiable property interest to even \nraise the question of due process related to that interest, and the Court \nhas already determined there is no property interest in the equity or fair \nmarket value of the home during foreclosure proceedings. Therefore, this \nclaim also could not survive a motion to dismiss.  \nD. Count IV—unjust enrichment \nPlaintiff  next  makes  a  claim  of  unjust  enrichment  against  all \nDefendants.  “A  claim  of  unjust  enrichment  requires  the  complaining \nparty to establish (1) the receipt of a benefit by the other party from the \ncomplaining party and (2) an inequity resulting to the complaining party \nbecause of the retention of the benefit by the other party.” Karaus v. Bank \nof New York Mellon, 831 N.W.2d 897, 905 (Mich. Ct. App. 2012). If the \n“benefit” in question does not flow directly from a plaintiff to a defendant, \nbut instead goes to a third-party defendant, the plaintiff can only hold \nthe third party liable if they can show some “misleading act by the third \nperson” that eventually lead to them receiving the benefit. Id. at 906. \n16 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-14042-TGB-MJH   ECF No. 64, PageID.1287   Filed 02/28/22   Page 17 of 18\nDefendants make various arguments as to why they have not been \nunjustly enriched. The Oakland Defendants maintain that the county did \nnot receive any surplus, and that therefore there is no “benefit” that it \ncan be shown to have received. ECF No. 52, PageID.861. This is true, as \ndiscussed above. The Southfield Public Defendants state that they legally \npurchased the property under the GPTA from Oakland and that even if \nthere was some surplus, it did not go to Southfield, meaning they did not \nreceive any “benefit.” ECF No. 54, PageID.1074. This is also accurate. \nThe  Southfield  Private  Defendants’  response  is  that  they  have  no \nobligation under law or equity to return the proceeds of any future sale \nto  Plaintiff—they  lawfully  acquired  the  property  and  have  no  legal \nobligation  to  her.  ECF  No.  53,  PageID.950-53.  All  three  groups  of \nDefendants conclude that any unjust enrichment claim is futile because \nit would be dismissed under a 12(b)(6) motion.  \nThe gist of Plaintiff’s argument is that it is unjust for any entity to \nprofit off her former property without her receiving any of the benefit. To \nbegin, there is no plausible evidence that the Oakland Defendants did \nreceive any profit or benefit. They received the delinquent taxes and \nnothing more. To the extent that the subsequent property owners—the \nCity of Southfield or the SNRI—received a benefit, they are third-party \nbeneficiaries, and Plaintiff has not shown any misleading or deceptive \nconduct  on  their  part.  Each  transaction  in  this  case  was  lawful  and \n17 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-14042-TGB-MJH   ECF No. 64, PageID.1288   Filed 02/28/22   Page 18 of 18\nfollowed  the  requirements  of  the  then-applicable  GPTA.  An  unjust \nenrichment claim would not survive a motion to dismiss.  \nE. Count V—civil conspiracy  \nPlaintiff’s last claim is for civil conspiracy under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, \ndefined as “an agreement between two or more persons to injure another \nby unlawful action.” Bazzi v. City of Dearborn, 658 F.3d 598, 602 (6th Cir. \n2011) (quoting Revis v. Meldrum, 489 F.3d 273, 290 (6th Cir. 2007). Here, \nthe  unlawful  action  would  be  an  alleged  violation  of  Plaintiff’s \nconstitutional rights; there is no allegation that Defendants failed to \nfollow  procedures  in  the  GPTA.  But  because  the  Court  has  already \ndetermined  Plaintiff  cannot  make  out  a  cognizable  violation  of  her \nconstitutional rights, she cannot maintain civil conspiracy claim either.  \nCONCLUSION \nFor  the  reasons  set  out  above,  Plaintiff’s  Motion  to  Amend  is \nDENIED.  Because  the  proposed  amendments  would  be  futile,  the \nComplaint must be, and hereby is, DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE.  \nSO ORDERED, this 28th day of February, 2022.  \n \n            BY THE COURT: \n \n \n/s/Terrence G. Berg   \nTERRENCE G. BERG \nUnited States District Judge \n18 \n ",

Ter1rence G. Berg \n  United States District Judge \nANDY MEISNER, et al.,   \nDefendants.  Michael J. Hluchaniuk \n____________________________/  United States Magistrate Judge \n \nREPORT AND RECOMMENDATION  \nDEFENDANTS’ MOTIONS TO DISMISS (ECF Nos. 13, 15, 17) \n \nI.  PROCEDURAL HISTORY \n  Plaintiff Marion Sinclair filed this action, pro se, challenging a state tax \nforeclosure action on property she owned in Southfield, Michigan, against various \ncity and county defendants.  (ECF No. 1).  In March 2019, defendants filed \nmotions to dismiss, largely challenging this Court’s subject matter jurisdiction over \nthis case.  (ECF Nos. 13, 15, 17).  The motions are fully briefed.  (ECF Nos. 22, \n23, 2, 26).  In December 2019, the case was administratively reassigned to the \nundersigned as Magistrate Judge.  On January 3, 2020, District Judge Terrence G. \nBerg referred pretrial matters to the undersigned.  (See Text-Only Order dated \n12/23/2019; ECF No. 33).   \n  For the reasons stated below, the undersigned recommends this case be \ndismissed without prejudice.  \n1 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-14042-TGB-MJH   ECF No. 34, PageID.601   Filed 01/09/20   Page 2 of 29\nII.  FACTUAL BACKGROUND \n \n  From what can be gleaned from the pleadings, plaintiff, proceeding pro se in \nthis case, was the former owner of a single-family residence at 15737 New \nHampshire Drive in Southfield, Michigan which is located in Oakland County. \nAfter plaintiff fell behind in her property taxes the Oakland County Treasurer \ninitiated forfeiture and foreclosure proceedings, on June 12, 2015, against the \nproperty pursuant to the General Property Tax Act, M.C.L. § 211.1 et. seq., \n(GPTA). The GPTA is a statutory procedure allowing public entities to foreclose \non properties that are delinquent in taxes and, in one of several alternative means, \nreturn the properties to the public rolls. The GPTA foreclosure procedure is \ndifferent from the general judicial foreclosure procedure provided for in Michigan \nlaw. M.C.L. § 600.3101, et seq. As part of the GTPA procedure, a judgment of \nforeclosure was entered in the Oakland County Circuit Court on February 2, 2016. \n(ECF No. 17-1, PageID.464). Documents attached to the judgment of foreclosure \nindicate that taxes had not been paid for years 2009-2013 and that the then existing \ndelinquency, including unpaid taxes as well as interest and fees, was $22,047.46. \n(ECF No. 17-1, PageID.468). Under the terms of the GPTA, M.C.L. § \n211.78k(5)(b), the judgment of foreclosure ordered that title to the property was \nvested in the Treasurer of the County of Oakland. The property was subsequently \nsold to the City of Southfield on July 7, 2016, for $28,424.84. (ECF No. 15-3, \n2 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-14042-TGB-MJH   ECF No. 34, PageID.602   Filed 01/09/20   Page 3 of 29\nPageID.381). This sale was permitted pursuant to the terms of the GPTA, M.C.L. § \n211.78m(1), after the “state” failed to act on its right of first refusal.  Plaintiff did \nnot appeal or otherwise challenge the judgment of foreclosure. \n  On September 22, 2016, the City of Southfield deeded the property to the \nSouthfield Neighborhood Revitalization Initiative, LLC (NRI), a non-public entity. \n(ECF No. 15-4, PageID.383). According to the Southfield Non-Profit Housing \nCorporation, the transfer was part of an ongoing relationship with the City of \nSouthfield whereby the NRI (a limited liability corporation with the Southfield \nNon-Profit Housing Corporation being the only member) would “[purchase] tax \nforeclosed and other properties, [improve] such properties, [then sell] such \nproperties to persons of low to moderate income [thus] improving housing and \nhomeownership opportunities in the City of Southfield and [thereby] restore tax-\nforeclosed properties to the tax-roll.” (ECF No. 15-1, PageID.359).    \n  Plaintiff alleges that she was “illegally evicted” from her house by various \nindividuals and that some of these individuals “broke in and changed her locks … \nwithout the benefit of a court order.” (ECF No. 8, PageID.120).  The specific date \nplaintiff left her residence is not entirely clear. At one point in her response to the \nmotions to dismiss plaintiff states that the “illegal home invasion” occurred on \nOctober 6, 2016. (ECF No. 22, PageID.520). In the affidavit attached to her \nresponse plaintiff asserts that the event took place on October 4, 2016. (ECF No. \n3 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-14042-TGB-MJH   ECF No. 34, PageID.603   Filed 01/09/20   Page 4 of 29\n22, PageID.526). The photographs attached to the brief in support of the motion of \nthe Southfield Non-Profit defendants to dismiss, which purport to show the \ncondition of the premises at the time plaintiff left, bear the date November 14, \n2016.  (ECF No. 15-5, PageID.385). Plaintiff alleges that employees of GTJ \nConsulting, LLC and JBR Disposal, LLC, “took” her from her home. (ECF No. 8, \nPageID.120). The Southfield Non-Profit defendants claim that plaintiff’s home was \n“deplorable” and “unhealthy” and she was “assisted” in moving to a “safe, clean \nand affordable apartment” when she left the residence. (ECF No. 15-1, \nPageID.360). Defendants do not claim to have had a court order to enter her home \nand remove her. \n  Plaintiff filed the present amended complaint alleging a number of claims all \narising out of the 2016 foreclosure of her residence in Southfield, Michigan, and \nher subsequent departure from that residence. The allegations include violations of \nthe Fair Housing Act, violations of Michigan statutory and common laws regarding \nillegal property transfer, Constitutional violations actionable through 42 U.S.C. § \n1983, violations of the Racketeer Influenced Corrupt Organization Act (RICO), 18 \nU.S.C.  § 1961, et seq., forcible illegal eviction in violation of state law, and \nconversion in violation of Michigan statutory and common laws. (ECF No. 8, \nPageID.132-141). \n4 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-14042-TGB-MJH   ECF No. 34, PageID.604   Filed 01/09/20   Page 5 of 29\n  The relief plaintiff requests includes (1) a declaratory judgment that \ndefendants have violated the Fair Housing Act, and (2) injunctions that would (a) \norder the creation of new rules regarding the transfer of property sold in a tax sale, \n(b) return plaintiff to the position she was in prior to the foreclosure, (c) “reverse \nthe tax foreclosure,” (d) require an immediate forensic accounting, and (e) require \nthat documents be produced that would relate to “all property sales” during 2016, \n2017, and 2018.  In addition, plaintiff asks that defendants be enjoined from \n“usurping rights of African-Americans to bid on properties at public auctions.” \nBesides the injunctive relief, plaintiff seeks money damages.  (ECF No. 8, \nPageID.145-48). \n  The responding defendants can be grouped into three categories including: \n(1) the City of Southfield defendants1, (2) the Southfield Non-Profit Housing \nCorporation defendants2, and (3) the Oakland County defendants3. The City of \nSouthfield defendants (hereinafter Southfield) filed a motion to dismiss seeking \ndismissal of the amended complaint under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1) claiming lack of \n                                                           \n  1 These defendants include the City of Southfield, Frederick Zorn, Gerald Witkowski, \nSue Ward-Witkowski, Irv Lowenberg, Michael Mandlebaum, Donald Fracassi, Daniel \nBrightwell, Myron Fraser, Lloyd Crews, and Nancy Banks. \n  2 These defendants include the Southfield Non-Profit Housing Corporation, the \nSouthfield Neighborhood Revitalization Initiative, LLC., Mitchell Simon, Rita Fulgiam Hillman, \nLora Brantley-Gilbert, Earlene Trayler-Neal, and E’Toile Libbits. \n  3 These defendants include Oakland County and Oakland County Treasurer Andy \nMeisner, in his official capacity. \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n5 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-14042-TGB-MJH   ECF No. 34, PageID.605   Filed 01/09/20   Page 6 of 29\nsubject matter jurisdiction. (ECF No. 13). The Southfield Non-Profit Corporation \ndefendants (hereinafter Southfield Non-Profit) also filed a motion to dismiss the \namended complaint under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1) claiming lack of subject matter \njurisdiction and under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) claiming failure to state a claim. \n(ECF No. 15). The Oakland County defendants (hereinafter Oakland) filed a \nmotion seeking the dismissal of the amended complaint under Fed. R. Civ. P. \n12(b)(1) claiming lack of subject matter jurisdiction and under Fed. R. Civ. P. \n12(b)(6) claiming failure to state a claim. (ECF No. 17).  \n  All three categories of defendants seek to have the amended complaint \ndismissed based on the provisions of the Tax Injunction Act (28 U.S.C. § 1341) \nand principles of comity. (ECF No. 13, PageID.290; ECF No. 15-1, PageID.365; \nand ECF No. 17, PageID.447).   \nIn her response to the arguments regarding the Tax Injunction Act (TIA) and \ncomity, plaintiff comments on the application of the TIA and comity but did not \ndirectly address the applicability of it to her circumstances. (ECF No. 22, \nPageID.520-21). In an apparent reference to the availability of adequate state \nremedies, plaintiff did mention that attempts by others to litigate similar claims in \nstate court had been unsuccessful. (ECF No. 22, PageID.517-18).  Plaintiff also \nresponded to the defendants’ motions to dismiss by arguing that the foreclosure of \nher residence was akin to the civil in rem forfeiture that the Supreme Court found \n6 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-14042-TGB-MJH   ECF No. 34, PageID.606   Filed 01/09/20   Page 7 of 29\nto be in violation of the excessive fines clause of the 8th Amendment citing Timbs \nv. Indiana, 568 U.S. 2 (2019). Additionally, plaintiff contended she was \nimproperly denied a property tax exemption based on her income level which, if \ngranted, would have allowed her to pay a reduced property tax. (ECF No. 22, \nPageID.516). With respect to the Rooker-Feldman doctrine, plaintiff contends she \nwas not trying to have a state court judgment reversed – she was merely seeking to \nvindicate her constitutional rights in federal court. (ECF No. 22, PageID.523).  \nIII.  DISCUSSION \nA.  Motion to Dismiss  \n  All three of defendants’ motions include arguments that are characterized as \nmotions to dismiss based on lack of subject matter jurisdiction under Fed. R. Civ. \nP. 12(b)(1). Two varieties of Rule 12(b)(1) motions exist: one is a facial challenge \nto the lawsuit where a defendant challenges the complaint on its face in an attempt \nto show the court lacks subject matter jurisdiction and the second variety is where \na defendant challenges the factual basis of the complaint in an attempt to make the \nsame showing. In the former circumstances the court takes the allegations of the \ncomplaint as true and in the latter circumstances the court is free to weigh the \nevidence and “no presumptive truthfulness” attaches to the allegations in the \ncomplaint. In either situation, the plaintiff has the burden of proof that the court \nhas subject matter jurisdiction. RMI titanium Co. v Westinghouse Electric Corp. et \n7 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-14042-TGB-MJH   ECF No. 34, PageID.607   Filed 01/09/20   Page 8 of 29\nal., 78 F.3d 1125, 1133-1135 (6th Cir. 1996). The motions to dismiss appear to be \na facial challenge to the amended complaint where the allegations in the complaint \nare taken as true. \nB.  Tax Injunction Act and Comity \n  All three categories of defendants contend that the Tax Injunction Act, 28 \nU.S.C. § 1341, bars federal district courts from addressing certain types of cases \nthat seek to “enjoin, suspend or restrain the assessment, levy or collection of any \ntax under State law where a plain, speedy and efficient remedy may be had in the \ncourts of such State.” To the extent a plaintiff is seeking damages other than \ninjunctive relief, defendants must look outside of the TIA because that legislation \nis limited to injunctive relief. However, relief including money damages, as well as \ninjunctive relief, is available under the principles of comity which is a separate, but \nrelated area of the common law that prohibits plaintiffs seeking money damages \narising out of states attempting to collect taxes. Wright v Pappas, 256 F.3d 635, \n637 (7th Cir. 2001).  \n  Plaintiff is clearly an intelligent individual, but she is not a lawyer and \ntherefore her pleadings are viewed differently than those drafted by an attorney. \nPro se litigants are entitled to a more liberal reading than pleadings drafted by a \nlawyer. Thomas v. Eby, 481 F.3d 434, 437 (6th Cir. 2007).  That being said, the \npleadings must still generally comply with the legal standards for matters pending \n8 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-14042-TGB-MJH   ECF No. 34, PageID.608   Filed 01/09/20   Page 9 of 29\nin federal court. Davis v. Prison Health Services, 679 F.3d 433, 437-38 (6th Cir. \n2012). The amended complaint sets out six causes of action as noted above. A \nseparate section of the complaint addresses the relief plaintiff is requesting and, for \nthe most part, the relief requested is not linked to the specific causes of action. The \ntype of relief requested is critical in determining if the court has subject matter \njurisdiction as limited by the TIA or the principles of comity. \n  Plaintiff’s requested relief includes: (1) “declaring” the “policies and \npractices” of Oakland and Southfield violate the Fair Housing Act; (2) “enjoining” \nOakland from continuing their current practices employed for disposing of tax \nforeclosed properties and requiring the creation of “rules” that would penalize \nsome of those practices; (3) ordering all defendants to “return” plaintiff to the \nposition she was in before the tax foreclosure process and award plaintiff monetary \ndamages that are allowable under M.C.L. §§ 600.2918 and 600.2919(a); (4) \nordering Oakland to “correct” discriminatory practices; (5) ordering Oakland and \nSouthfield to “restore” plaintiff to the “position Plaintiff would have occupied but \nfor discriminatory conduct;” (6) ordering Oakland to “reverse the tax foreclosure” \nand provide “marketable title” to plaintiff; (7) ordering “Defendant corporations” \nand Southfield Non-Profit to provide a “forensic accounting” of “all monies \nreceived and expended” relating to the foreclosure of plaintiff’s property and that \nof 116 or more other properties that were foreclosed on in 2016, 2017, and 2018; \n9 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-14042-TGB-MJH   ECF No. 34, PageID.609   Filed 01/09/20   Page 10 of 29\n(8) ordering Southfield Non-Profit to “provide documentation” of all property \nsales regarding property transfers in 2016, 2017, and 2018 and to “rescind and \nrevert” any of those transfers that were improper; (9) ordering Oakland to \ndiscontinue transferring foreclosed properties to private corporations contrary to \nM.C.L. § 213.23(2); ordering Southfield and Southfield Non-Profit, as well as \nother named defendants, to ‘”cease usurping the rights of African-American \nSouthfield residents to bid on properties at the public auction; and (10) ordering \nOakland and “all other Defendants” to return plaintiff’s property to the tax roles \n[sic]” and award monetary damages to plaintiff. (ECF No. 8, PageID.145-149). \n  While couched in different claims, it is clear that plaintiff’s complaint is \nfocused on the state tax foreclosure procedure that resulted in the loss of her \nproperty. Most of her claims, in one way or another, seek to invalidate the tax \nforeclosure process employed in her case or obtain monetary damages from some \nor all of the defendants for the wrongs that she claims to have suffered. Two of her \nclaims, illegal eviction and conversion, are state law-based claims that do not seek \nto invalidate the tax foreclosure process. \n  The TIA addresses any attempt to “enjoin, suspend, or restrain the \nassessment, levy or collection of any tax under State law.” 28 U.S.C. § 1341. This \nfederal statute “creates a jurisdictional barrier … for claims of declaratory or \ninjunctive relief brought by a party aggrieved by a state’s administration of its \n10 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-14042-TGB-MJH   ECF No. 34, PageID.610   Filed 01/09/20   Page 11 of 29\ntaxing authority.” Pegross v. Oakland Cnty. Treasurer, 592 F.App’x 380, 384 (6th \nCir. 2014). Without doubt the tax foreclosure procedure at the heart of plaintiff’s \ncomplaint is a core aspect of a “state’s administration of its taxing authority.” To \nthe extent that plaintiff’s amended complaint seeks to declare as improper or enjoin \nthe tax foreclosure procedure that resulted in the loss of her home, those efforts \nwould be barred by the TIA as long as there is a “plain, speedy and efficient \nremedy [that] may be had in the courts of such State.” 28 U.S.C. § 1341.  \n  Defendants also invoke a related, but independent, common-law principle \nthat would, if applicable, serve to prevent a federal district court from taking \njurisdiction of challenges to state tax administration. This principle, referred to as \ncomity, is a form of abstention that prevents federal district courts from becoming \nentangled in state tax disputes. This principle is “substantially broader” than the \nbar imposed by the Tax Injunction Act.  In re Gillis, 836 F.2d 1001, 1006 (6th Cir. \n1988). A part of plaintiff’s prayer for relief is a request for monetary damages. \nThis type of relief is outside the scope of the “declaratory or injunctive” relief that \nis barred by the TIA but comes within the parameters of the comity principle. Fair \nAssessment in Real Estate Ass’n v. McNary, 454 U.S. 100, 110 (1981). The comity \nprinciple also requires a state court remedy to be available to the plaintiff before \nthe case will be barred from federal district court. Under the comity principle, the \nstate court remedy must be “plain, adequate, and complete” in order for the case to \n11 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-14042-TGB-MJH   ECF No. 34, PageID.611   Filed 01/09/20   Page 12 of 29\nbe barred. Id. 454 U.S. at 116. It is really the nature of the relief sought, rather than \nthe specific claims, that determine the applicability of the TIA/comity standards. \nAttempts to challenge the state’s tax administration are subject to those standards \nwithout regard to specific claims made. \nWhile the definition of the state court remedy required by both the TIA and \nthe comity principle differs in wording, there is “no significant difference” \nbetween the “plain, speedy, and efficient remedy” identified in the TIA and the \n“plain, adequate, and complete” state remedy identified in the comity principle. Id. \n454 U.S. at 116 n. 8.  State “remedies are plain, adequate, and complete if they \nprovide the taxpayer with a full hearing and judicial determination at which the \ntaxpayer may raise any … objections to the tax.” Gillis, 836 F.2d at 1010.  \n  On four recent occasions this court, speaking through four different judges, \nhas addressed situations in which property owners have challenged state \nforeclosure proceedings under the GPTA. In each of these occasions the judges \nconsistently determined that the court lacked jurisdiction to entertain claims \npursued in federal court that would in some manner “enjoin, suspend, or restrain” \nthe collection of state taxes or the enforcement of the GPTA. In Rafaeli, LLC v. \nWayne County, 2015 WL 3522546 (E.D. Mich, June 4, 2015), Judge Berg \nconcluded that the TIA and the principles of comity barred federal district courts \nfrom considering the plaintiffs’ constitutional challenges to the GPTA. Judge Berg \n12 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-14042-TGB-MJH   ECF No. 34, PageID.612   Filed 01/09/20   Page 13 of 29\ndetermined that plaintiff’s challenges were “for claims of declaratory or injunctive \nrelief brought by a party aggrieved by a state’s administration of its taxing \nauthority” and that “a plain, adequate, and complete remedy [was] available in the \nstate courts.” Id., at 7-8.4 Adequate state remedies were identified by Judge Berg as \nexisting in the GTPA, M.C.L. § 211.78l, and the Oakland County Circuit Court. Id.  \nThe following year Judge Levy considered claims of a purported class action \nthat brought constitutional and statutory challenges regarding the Michigan GPTA. \nIn Hammoud v. County of Wayne, 2016 WL 4560635 (E.D. Mich. 2016), aff’d 697 \nFed. App’x 445 (6th Cir. 2017), Judge Levy, contrary to the plaintiff’s argument, \ndetermined that the constitutional claims and some of the state statutory claims \nsought to “set aside the judgments of foreclosure, vest title back in plaintiffs’ \nnames, and permit plaintiffs to pay the back taxes owed” and therefore that relief \n“would certainly ‘enjoin, suspend or restrain the assessment, levy or collection of a \n[ ] tax under State law’” thus triggering the prohibitions of the TIA and requiring \nthe dismissal of those claims. Id. at 4. The opinion further noted that various state \n                                                           \n  4 Plaintiffs in that case have pursued related constitutional claims in state court and leave \nto appeal from an unfavorable decision in the Michigan Court of Appeals has been granted by \nthe Michigan Supreme Court, Rafaeli, LLC v. Oakland County, 503 Mich. 909 (2018), with oral \nargument scheduled to take place in November of 2019, Rafaeli, LLC v. Oakland County, 932 \nN.W.2d 1 (2019).  The Michigan Supreme Court held oral argument, and on November 27th \nallowed the parties to file post-argument supplemental briefing by December 13th.  Id. at 935 \nN.W.2d 354.  Both parties filed supplemental briefs.  See filings listed on state Supreme Court \nwebsite, https://courts.michigan.gov/Courts/MichiganSupremeCourt/oral-arguments/2019-\n2020/Pages/156849.aspx.   \n13 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-14042-TGB-MJH   ECF No. 34, PageID.613   Filed 01/09/20   Page 14 of 29\ncourt remedies were available to plaintiffs, citing a number of state court cases in \nwhich similar claims were adjudicated. The comity principle relating to federal \ndistrict court jurisdiction of state tax administration was not a part of Judge Levy’s \nanalysis. A civil RICO claim and several state statutory claims were also dismissed \nin the ruling but for different reasons. Judge Levy concluded that these statutory \nclaims did not directly threaten the state tax administration and therefore the TIA \ndid not apply to these claims. The civil RICO claim was dismissed because the \ncomplaint did not properly allege the requirements of such a claim and the \nremaining state statutory claims were dismissed because all the federal claims were \nbeing dismissed and the court did “not have supplemental jurisdiction to address” \nthe state statutory claims in the absence of a cognizable federal claim. Id. at 8.  \nAdequate state remedies were identified in the ruling on these claims that were \nsimilar in many respects to the claims in the present case. Id. at 5. \n  In Freed v. Thomas, 2018 WL 5831013 (E.D. Mich. Nov. 7, 2018)5 Judge \nFriedman dismissed, for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, constitutional claims \nregarding the Michigan GTPA based on the TIA and comity principles. Id. at 3.  \nJudge Friedman, echoing the views of several other judges, characterized the \nGTPA as an “unfair tax collection regimen” but was bound by Wayside Church v. \nVan Buren County, 847 F.3d 812 (6th Cir. 2017) to rule that the federal district \n                                                           \n  5 This decision is currently on appeal to the Sixth Circuit. \n14 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-14042-TGB-MJH   ECF No. 34, PageID.614   Filed 01/09/20   Page 15 of 29\ncourts, when adequate remedies exist in Michigan courts, did not have subject \nmatter jurisdiction over challenges to the GTPA. Id. Citing Wayside Church again, \nJudge Friedman found that the plaintiff had adequate state remedies, even if those \nremedies were not likely to result in the relief plaintiff was seeking. Id. at 4, n. 1). \n  More recently, Judge Borman dismissed a complaint with a strikingly \nsimilar set of claims to the present amended complaint. In Edwards v. Meisner, \n2019 WL 78890 (E.D. Mich. Jan. 2, 2019) the plaintiff had attempted to challenge \nthe tax foreclosure sale of his residence in the City of Southfield through litigation \nin Oakland County Circuit Court. That effort proved unsuccessful for the plaintiff \nand the Southfield Neighborhood Revitalization Initiative, LLC, the title holder to \nthe property following the foreclosure sale, obtained a judgment of eviction from a \nstate district court. Plaintiff filed the complaint in federal court and sought a \npreliminary injunction to halt the eviction pursuant to the state court order. Judge \nBorman denied the motion for a preliminary injunction and, sua sponte, dismissed \nthe complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The ruling was based initially \non the Rooker-Feldman doctrine6 in that the relief requested by plaintiff could not \nbe granted without invalidating the state court judgment of foreclosure and the \n                                                           \n  6 The Rooker-Feldman doctrine is based on two Supreme Court decisions, District of \nColumbia Court of Appeals v. Feldman, 460 U.S. 462 (1983) and Rooker v. Fidelity Trust Co. \n263 U.S. 413 (1923), which stand for the proposition that under 28 U.S.C. § 1257(a) lower \nfederal courts do not have subject matter jurisdiction to review the decisions of state courts. \n15 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-14042-TGB-MJH   ECF No. 34, PageID.615   Filed 01/09/20   Page 16 of 29\nstate court judgment of eviction which, under Rooker-Feldman, the district court \ndoes not have jurisdiction to do. Judge Borman also ruled, even if Rooker-Feldman \ndid not apply, that the TIA and comity principles barred the district court from \nassuming jurisdiction of plaintiff’s claims in that in order to grant the relief \nplaintiff requested the court would have to “enjoin, suspend or restrain the \nassessment, levy or collection of [a] tax under State law.” 28 U.S.C. § 1341. Judge \nBorman recognized the requirement, for application of the TIA and comity \nprinciples, that an adequate state court remedy must exist and pointed to plaintiff’s \nefforts to litigate the same issues in state court prior to filing the action in federal \ncourt as proof that such remedies existed.  The decision that adequate state \nremedies existed, for purposes of imposing the jurisdictional limitations of the TIA \nand comity principles, was made regardless of whether those remedies had been \nsuccessful, would be successful, or even if those remedies had lapsed.  As long as \nstate remedies could have been pursued, they were adequate.  2019 WL 78890, at \n8-9. \n  The above cases from this district establish a well-worn path for dismissing \ncases filed in the federal district court that challenge the tax foreclosure and \nrevenue raising scheme of the State of Michigan under the TIA and principles of \ncomity. That path should be followed here as well. While plaintiff presents as a \nsympathetic individual in unfortunate circumstances, federal law clearly \n16 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-14042-TGB-MJH   ECF No. 34, PageID.616   Filed 01/09/20   Page 17 of 29\nestablishes jurisdictional barriers to challenges to the administration of state \ntaxation procedures. Plaintiff has the burden of proof to establish subject matter \njurisdiction and that burden has not been met here.  Counts One through Four of \nthe amended complaint allege violations of constitutional or statutory rights \nrelating directly to the tax foreclosure and sale of plaintiff’s residence in 2016. The \nrelief plaintiff requests is not linked to specific claims but does include declaratory \nrelief, injunctive relief, and money damages.  To grant that requested relief would \nrequire this court to “enjoin, suspend or restrain the assessment, levy or collection \nof [a] tax under State law” which this court in not permitted to do under the TIA. \nThe TIA only prohibits declaratory or injunctive relief but a request for damages \narising out of a tax collection process is barred by the free-standing principle of \ncomity. Pegross v. Oakland County Treasurer, 592 F.App’x 380, 386 (6th Cir. \n2014). Plaintiff does not claim that adequate state remedies do not exist – only that \nsuch remedies are likely to be unsuccessful. Likelihood of success is not the test of \nadequacy for purposes of the TIA or comity. Four judges in this district, as noted \nabove, found that adequate remedies existed in the Michigan state courts for the \ngrievances alleged in those cases and those are the same, or substantially similar, to \nthe grievances plaintiff here alleges. \n  Counts Five and Six of plaintiff’s amended complaint present a different set \nof circumstances. Those claims, “Forcible Illegal Eviction Under State Law” \n17 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-14042-TGB-MJH   ECF No. 34, PageID.617   Filed 01/09/20   Page 18 of 29\n(Count Five) and “Conversion” (Count Six) are based on alleged violations of \nMichigan statutory and common law. Plaintiff seeks money damages for both of \nthese claims. An award of damages in either of these claims would not “enjoin, \nsuspend or restrain the assessment, levy or collection” of a state tax. The TIA \n“operates ‘particularly’ to protect the States’ ‘revenue raising’ mechanisms” \nthrough the taxation process.  BellSouth Telecommunications, Inc. v. Farris, 542 \nF.3d 499, 502 (6th Cir. 2008) (quoting from Wright v. McClain, 835 F.2d 143, 144 \n(6th Cir. 1987)). Here, the revenue had already been raised by the time the plaintiff \nwas allegedly removed from her residence and her personal possessions were taken \nby the private actors who had come to clean out her house. Although the \nTIA/comity broom does not sweep counts Five and Six away they have to be \ndismissed for another reason. State claims can only be pursued in federal court if \nthey are “supplemental” to appropriate federal claims pending in the same action. \n28 U.S.C. § 1367. With Counts One through Four dismissed there are no other \nfederal claims remaining and Counts Five and Six must also be dismissed without \nprejudice.   \nC.  Rooker-Feldman Doctrine \n  Defendants Oakland and Southfield contend that a second basis for dismissal \nof the complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction is the Rooker-Feldman \ndoctrine.  The Rooker-Feldman doctrine reflects the statutory provisions of 28 \n18 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-14042-TGB-MJH   ECF No. 34, PageID.618   Filed 01/09/20   Page 19 of 29\nU.S.C. § 1257(a) which provides that review of state court judgments lies in the \nSupreme Court, rather than federal district courts. The doctrine applies to “state-\ncourt losers complaining of injuries caused by state-court judgments rendered \nbefore the district court proceedings commenced and inviting district court review \nand rejection of those judgments. Rooker-Feldman does not otherwise override or \nsupplant preclusion doctrine or augment the circumscribed doctrines that allow \nfederal courts to stay or dismiss proceedings in deference to state-court actions.” \nExxon Mobil Corp. v. Saudi Basic Indus. Corp., 544 U.S. 280, 284 (2005).  “Nor \ndoes [Rooker-Feldman] stop a district court from exercising subject matter \njurisdiction simply because a party attempts to litigate in federal court a matter \npreviously litigated in state court. If a federal court plaintiff ‘present[s] some \nindependent claim, albeit one that denies a legal conclusion that a state court has \nreached in a case to which it was a party …, then there is jurisdiction and state law \ndetermines whether the defendant prevails under principles of preclusion.’” Id. \n(quoting GASH v. Vill. Of Rosemont, 995 F.2d 726, 728 (7th Cir. 1993) (ellipses in \noriginal)). \nIn applying Rooker-Feldman, the appropriate “inquiry … is the source of the \ninjury the plaintiff alleges in the federal complaint. If the source of the injury is the \nstate court decision, then the Rooker-Feldman would prevent the district court \nfrom asserting jurisdiction. If there is some other source of injury, such as a third \n19 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-14042-TGB-MJH   ECF No. 34, PageID.619   Filed 01/09/20   Page 20 of 29\nparty’s actions, then the plaintiff asserts an independent claim” and Rooker-\nFeldman does not bar the claim in federal court. McCormick v. Braverman, 451 \nF.3d 382, 393 (6th Cir. 2006).   \nBoth defendants that have raised Rooker-Feldman in their motions to \ndismiss seek to have the entire amended complaint dismissed on that basis. Their \nanalysis does not reflect the nuanced approach that is necessary to properly \nconsider the Rooker-Feldman doctrine as a basis for dismissing plaintiff’s \namended complaint.  \nIn determining the applicability of the Rooker–Feldman doctrine, federal \ncourts “cannot simply compare the issues involved in the state-court proceeding to \nthose raised in the federal-court plaintiff's complaint,” but instead “must pay close \nattention to the relief sought by the federal-court plaintiff.”  Bianchi v. \nRylaarsdam, 334 F.3d 895, 900 (9th Cir. 2003) (emphasis in original); Berry v. \nSchmitt, 688 F.3d 290, 299 (6th Cir. 2012).  Where the plaintiff seeks injunctive \nand declaratory relief prohibiting the future application of a statute, and not to \noverturn the state court’s judgment under that statute, Rooker-Feldman does not \napply.  Hood v. Keller, 341 F.3d 593, 598 (6th Cir. 2003).  However, where the \nplaintiff seeks to overturn the state court rulings, and not just a declaration that the \napplicable state law is unconstitutional, Rooker-Feldman applies.   \n20 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-14042-TGB-MJH   ECF No. 34, PageID.620   Filed 01/09/20   Page 21 of 29\nPlaintiff alleges six distinct claims in her amended complaint. (ECF 8). \nThose claims include: (1) race discrimination, (2) illegal property transfer in \nviolation of state law, (3) due process, (4) RICO, (5) forcible illegal eviction, and \n(6) conversion. The only state court judgment in the history of this case is the \njudgment of foreclosure entered on February 2, 2016. Counts 5 and 6 of the \namended complaint relate to allegations regarding plaintiff’s removal from her \nresidence in approximately October of 2016 and these counts include specific \nrequests for money damages. With respect to these two counts, the injury claimed \nis not based on a state court judgment and therefore these claims are not barred by \nRooker-Feldman. \nThe first four counts of plaintiff’s amended complaint raise claims that, it \ncould be argued, are not based directly on the state court judgment of foreclosure. \nHowever, the general prayer for relief seeks, among other things, relief that \nincludes “return[ing]” plaintiff to the position she was in, “restor[ing]” plaintiff to \nthe position she was in before defendants’ conduct, and “revers[ing] the tax \nforeclosure against” her. (ECF No. 8, PageID.146-47). As noted above, the relief \nrequested is more the measure of the application of Rooker-Feldman than the \nspecific claims made. In that the relief requested is generally alleged it cannot be \ndetermined, from the face of the amended complaint, whether the request to \n21 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-14042-TGB-MJH   ECF No. 34, PageID.621   Filed 01/09/20   Page 22 of 29\n“restore” plaintiff to the position she was in before the judgment of foreclosure is \napplicable to a single claim or all four of claims alleged in Counts 1-4. \nPlaintiff’s amended complaint is almost a word-for-word copy of the \ncomplaint in Edwards v. Meisner, Case No. 18-cv-13488 (E.D. Mich.). As noted \nabove, Judge Borman dismissed that complaint for lack of subject matter \njurisdiction in part based on Rooker-Feldman. In his ruling on the Rooker-Feldman \nquestion, Judge Borman stated that if the plaintiff was seeking the reversal of the \nstate court judgment of foreclosure then dismissal under Rooker-Feldman was \nappropriate. Judge Borman went on to state that he could not “award [plaintiff’s \nrequested] relief without invalidating the state court judgment of foreclosure and \norder of eviction [and therefore] Rooker-Feldman applies and bars this Court from \nexercising jurisdiction over Plaintiff’s claims seeking to invalidate these state court \njudgments.” 2019 WL 78890, at 7.7  \nThe undersigned agrees with Judge Borman’s ruling in Edwards. The same \nclaims were made in that case as were made in Counts 1-4 of the present amended \ncomplaint. The same relief was requested there as well and it sought to invalidate \nthe prior state court judgment of foreclosure just as plaintiff is attempting to do \n                                                           \n  7 The Edwards case had two state court judgments to consider, one for foreclosure and a \nsecond judgment for eviction. The present case does not include an eviction judgment but that \ndoes not change the application of Rooker-Feldman to the facts of this case because the relief \nrequested necessarily reached the foreclosure judgment even if there was no eviction judgment. \n22 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-14042-TGB-MJH   ECF No. 34, PageID.622   Filed 01/09/20   Page 23 of 29\nhere. On that basis, Counts 1-4 of the present amended complaint should be \ndismissed pursuant to Rooker-Feldman for lack of subject matter jurisdiction in \nthis court. Counts 5-6 should not be dismissed on the same basis. \nRes Judicata \n  The Oakland and Southfield Non-Profit defendants assert that the amended \ncomplaint should be dismissed based on principles of res judicata. In essence, these \ndefendants contend that the claims plaintiff has raised in her amended complaint \nshould be dismissed because they could have been raised in the tax foreclosure \nproceedings that resulted in a judgment of foreclosure in state court. “The \npreclusive effect of a state court judgment in a subsequent federal lawsuit generally \nis determined by the full faith and credit statute, which provides that state judicial \nproceedings ‘shall have the same full faith and credit in every court within the \nUnited States … as they have by law or usage in the courts of such State … from \nwhich they are taken.’” Marrese v. American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, \n470 U.S. 373, 380 (1985), quoting from 28 U.S.C. § 1738. “’It has long been \nestablished that § 1738 does not allow federal courts to employ their own rules of \nres judicata in determining the effect of state judgments. Rather, it goes beyond the \ncommon law and commands a federal court to accept the rules chosen by the State \nfrom which the judgment is taken.’” Id., quoting from Kremer v. Chemical \nConstruction Corp., 456 U.S. 461, 481-482 (1982).  \n23 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-14042-TGB-MJH   ECF No. 34, PageID.623   Filed 01/09/20   Page 24 of 29\n  “Michigan courts have broadly applied the doctrine of res judicata. They \nhave barred, not only claims already litigated, but every claim arising from the \nsame transaction that the parties, exercising reasonable diligence, could have raised \nbut did not.” Sewell v. Clean Cut Mgmt, Inc., 463 Mich. 569, 575 (2001). “The test \nfor determining whether two claims arise out of the same transaction and are \nidentical for res judicata purposes is whether the same facts or evidence are \nessential to the maintenance of the two actions.” Jones v. State Farm Mut. Auto. \nIns. Co., 202 Mich. App. 393, 401 (1993). Defendant Southfield Non-Profit alleges \nthat “the relief sought by Plaintiff in this case is the same as in her State Court \nproceedings.” (ECF No. 15-1, PageID.370). It is not entirely clear what counsel \nmeant by that statement because there is nothing in this record to suggest that \nplaintiff actually appeared in state court and made any particular claims regarding \nthe tax foreclosure of her former residence. If plaintiff did not appear in state court, \nas would appear to be the case here, the only issue actually addressed in the state \ncourt proceeding was whether the property was delinquent in taxes, interest, \npenalties, and fees and whether the property had been redeemed. M.C.L. § \n211.78g-211.78h. If these findings were made the final judgment of foreclosure \nwould issue under M.C.L. § 211.78k(5). \n  There is at least one exception to the broad application of the doctrine of res \njudicata in Michigan. In J.A.M. Corp. v. AARO Disposal, Inc., 461 Mich. 161 \n24 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-14042-TGB-MJH   ECF No. 34, PageID.624   Filed 01/09/20   Page 25 of 29\n(1999) the Michigan Supreme Court reviewed a situation in which the plaintiff had \npreviously litigated a matter under the Michigan summary proceedings law, \nM.C.L. § 600.5701 et seq., in state district court and then later pursued other \nclaims in state circuit court. In the court’s analysis of a res judicata defense to the \ncircuit court action, it was noted that a section of the summary proceedings law, \nMCL § 600.5750, “evidences the Legislature’s intent that summary proceedings \nfor possession of property be handled expeditiously. Plainly the Legislature took \nthese cases outside the realm of the normal rules concerning merger and bar in \norder that attorneys would not be obligated to fasten all other pending claims to the \nswiftly moving summary proceedings.” Id. at 168-69. Later the court noted that “in \nlight of the first sentence of MCL 600.570 … clarifying that the remedy in these \nsummary proceedings, no matter who prevails, does not bar other claims for relief” \nand reversed the decisions of lower courts, that had ruled res judicata barred the \nclaims made by plaintiff in circuit court. Id. at 170-71.  \n  The Michigan tax foreclosure law bears some resemblance to the summary \nproceedings law with respect to a perceived legislative intent to create an expedited \nprocedure for foreclosure in tax delinquency cases, as compared to the general \nforeclosure procedure. The tax foreclosure procedure condenses the process for \nobtaining a judgment, has a shorter redemption period than the general Michigan \n25 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-14042-TGB-MJH   ECF No. 34, PageID.625   Filed 01/09/20   Page 26 of 29\nforeclosure procedure,8 and eliminates the possible payment of a surplus to the \ndelinquent party.9 These factors evidence an intent to streamline the foreclosure \nprocess in tax delinquency circumstances. Additionally, and particularly significant \nfor a res judicata analysis, is the statutory limitation on the issues that can be \nlitigated in the tax foreclosure process. M.C.L. § 211.78k(2) identifies only six \nissues that can be raised by “the person claiming an interest in a parcel of property” \nsubject to the tax foreclosure process and none of these limited issues are \ncomparable to the issues raised by plaintiff in Counts 1-4 of her amended \ncomplaint. Litigating the claims made in plaintiff’s amended complaint would \nclearly involve facts beyond those that were, or could have been litigated in the \nstate court tax foreclosure proceeding. \n  While without question the Michigan res judicata law is “broad” and \nincludes issues that were raised in a prior litigation as well as issues that “could” \nhave been raised, it does not appear that plaintiff could have raised her claims in \nthe tax foreclosure process given the jurisdictional limitations on that process \n                                                           \n  8 The general foreclosure procedure calls for a six-month redemption period, M.C.L. § \n600.3140(1), whereas the tax foreclosure procedure calls for a 21-day redemption period in \ncontested cases.  M.C.L. § 211.78i(6)(g). \n  9 The general foreclosure procedure provides for the payment of any surplus generated \nafter subtracting the delinquency owed from the proceeds of the public sale whereas the tax \nforeclosure procedure does not require such payment. This aspect of the tax foreclosure \nprocedure has sparked judicial criticism of the process including, as noted earlier, Judge \nFriedman’s characterization of the process as an “unfair tax collection regimen.” Freed v. \nThomas, 2018 WL 5831013 at 3 (E.D. Mich. Nov. 7, 2018). \n26 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-14042-TGB-MJH   ECF No. 34, PageID.626   Filed 01/09/20   Page 27 of 29\nprovided for in M.C.L. § 211.78k(2). Counts 5-6 of the amended complaint are \nobviously outside the scope of what could have been litigated in the tax foreclosure \nmatter because they took place months after the tax foreclosure judgment was \nentered. \n  Both of these groups of defendants cite Anderson v. County of Wayne, 2011 \nWL 2470467 (E.D. Mich. Jun 20, 2011) in support of their arguments that \nplaintiff’s amended complaint should be dismissed based on principles of res \njudicata. Anderson did involve a matter previously litigated in a Michigan tax \nforeclosure proceeding that was brought to federal district court by the plaintiff in \nan attempt to have the federal court “vacate” the state foreclosure judgment. In \nruling that the federal claim was barred by res judicata principles, Judge Borman \nstated that the exact issue raised in the federal case - whether plaintiff should be \npermitted to make partial payments on the tax liabilities - had been litigated in state \ncourt and it was the only issue litigated in the state court. That fact distinguishes it \nfrom the present case in that Judge Borman did not address the scope of what could \nhave been raised in the state court tax foreclosure case. \n  Based on the above analysis, the undersigned concludes that res judicata \ndoes not bar plaintiff’s amended complaint. \nD.  Failure to State a Claim \n27 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-14042-TGB-MJH   ECF No. 34, PageID.627   Filed 01/09/20   Page 28 of 29\n  Defendants Oakland and Southfield Non-Profit also seek to have the \namended complaint dismissed due to the plaintiff’s failure to state a claim on \nwhich relief can be granted pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). In light of the \nundersigned’s conclusion that this case should be dismissed in its entirety based on \nthe TIA, principles of comity, as well as the Rooker-Feldman doctrine, it is not \nnecessary to address the defendants’ arguments under Rule 12(b)(6).   \nIV.  RECOMMENDATION \nFor the reasons set forth above, the undersigned RECOMMENDS that the \ncase be DISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE.   \n  The parties to this action may object to and seek review of this Report and \nRecommendation, but are required to file any objections within 14 days of service, \nas provided for in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 72(b)(2) and Local Rule \n72.1(d).

Sec’y of Health and \nHuman Servs., 932 F.2d 505 (6th Cir. 1981).  Filing objections that raise some \nissues but fail to raise others with specificity will not preserve all the objections a \nparty might have to this Report and Recommendation.  Willis v.
