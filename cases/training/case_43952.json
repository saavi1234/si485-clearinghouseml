    "summary": "<p>This is a challenge to Phoenix&rsquo;s policies policing homelessness and the City&rsquo;s treatment of unsheltered individuals concerning unreasonable seizure and destruction of property during &ldquo;homeless sweeps.&rdquo; On November 30, 2023, the Fund for Empowerment (FFE) and two individual plaintiffs filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District court for the District of Arizona. Defendants included the City of Phoenix and police officials in their official capacities. Represented by the ACLU of Arizona, plaintiffs sued under 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1983 and Monell for violations of their civil rights under the Fourth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments. Plaintiffs sought declaratory relief against city codes banning unsheltered people from sleeping in public places, an injunction against the City&rsquo;s raids on homeless encampments, and attorney&rsquo;s fees. Plaintiffs claimed that the defendants discriminated against the unsheltered community of Phoenix in various ways as follows:</p>\r\n<p>First, plaintiffs alleged their Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights, the latter under the Due Process Clause, were violated during the City&rsquo;s campaign of &ldquo;clean sweep&rdquo; raids targeting the unsheltered community. During such raids, the defendants indiscriminately seized and destroyed personal property of unsheltered individuals without cause, warrant, or due process. Plaintiffs further asserted that defendants&rsquo; actions violated plaintiffs&rsquo; Fourteenth Amendment rights under the Due Process Clause by forcing the unsheltered community into danger in &ldquo;the Zone,&rdquo; an over-crowded downtown city area that is unshaded and reaches temperatures as high as 118&rsquo;F. Additionally, the plaintiffs asserted in their Eighth Amendment claim that such raids criminalize and punish the population based on their status as unsheltered, while knowing that the city lacks proper affordable housing and emergency shelter to serve as alternative relief. Finally, they asserted in a <em>Monell</em> claim that the defendants knowingly used city ordinances &sect; 23-30(A) (&ldquo;Camping Ban&rdquo;) and &sect; 23-48.01 (&ldquo;Sleeping Ban&rdquo;) to penalize residents for engaging in unavoidable human activities like sleeping in public while unhoused. The case was originally assigned to District Judge John J. Tuchi and re-assigned to District Judge G. Murray Snow on December 16, 2023. A month after filing the initial complaint, the plaintiffs submitted an amended complaint on January 13, 2023, adding another individual plaintiff to the suit.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On the same day as filing their complaint, the plaintiffs also filed a Motion for Preliminary Injunction, requesting that the court enjoin the City from beginning &ldquo;enhanced sweeps&rdquo; of the Zone. On December 16, 2022, the court granted and denied the motion in part. 646 F. Supp. 3d 1117. The judge enjoined the City from seizing and destroying any property of unsheltered individuals without providing prior notice, or securely maintaining it for a minimum of 30 days, because the Fourth Amendment&rsquo;s Due Process Clause prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures. The judge also enjoined the City from enforcing the Camping and Sleeping Bans because the Eighth Amendment prohibits the state from imposing criminal penalties for conduct on public property that is an unavoidable consequence of being homeless. However, the judge declined to enjoin the City from moving forward with its new enhanced cleanups of the Zone, because plaintiffs failed to demonstrate that the City intends to execute this plan by unconstitutional means.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The parties engaged in mediation, and on April 3, 2023, the court vacated pending hearings and ordered dismissal without prejudice within 30 days, anticipating a settlement agreement. After agreeing to extend the deadline to June, the parties notified the court on May 15 that they had not reached an agreement and requested that the case be removed from the dismissal calendar. The next day, plaintiffs filed a Motion for Order to Show Cause for why defendants should not be held in civil contempt of the preliminary injunction for the sweep of the Zone the City conducted on May 10, 2023. Plaintiffs alternatively requested a modification of the preliminary injunction. On May 22, the court granted the defendants&rsquo; request for an emergency continuance to respond to the plaintiffs&rsquo; motion. Given that it was unclear whether defendants planned to move forward with the cleanup on May 24, the court also ordered defendants to not conduct any cleanups in the Zone prior to a hearing on the motion to modify the preliminary injunction.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On May 23, individual property owners and businesses moved to intervene in this case. The parties noted that they were plaintiffs in an ongoing state court lawsuit against the city of Phoenix, in which they claim the city&rsquo;s continued maintenance of the Zone constitutes a public nuisance. Brown v. City of Phoenix, No. CV2022-010439 (Maricopa County Super. Ct., filed Aug. 10, 2022). The court granted the motion to intervene on May 25.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>After a hearing on May 26, the court denied the plaintiffs&rsquo; Motion for Order to Show Cause and Request for Modification of Preliminary Injunction, and also lifted the order prohibiting defendants from conducting cleanups in the Zone. Soon after, the intervenors filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, arguing that the city&rsquo;s sweeps of homeless encampments do not rise to an Eighth Amendment violation because they do not punish individuals for their status. The intervenors refuted the Fourth Amendment claim by stating that injunctive relief is &ldquo;almost always&rdquo; inappropriate for Fourth Amendment violations, which are better remedied by suppression of evidence or a suit for damages. The motion to dismiss was later joined by the City of Phoenix.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On October 9th, 2023, the City of Phoenix filed a motion to amend or modify the preliminary injunction. The city cited the impossibility of complying with both the preliminary injunction in this case&mdash;which limits how quickly the city can remove unsheltered individuals from the Zone&mdash;and the permanent injunction issued by the state court in Brown v. City of Phoenix on September 20. In that case, the Maricopa County Superior Court found that the Zone was a public nuisance and subsequently ordered the City of Phoenix to abate the nuisance by removing tents and drug paraphernalia from the downtown area by November 4, 2023.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Following a hearing on October 17, the court modified the preliminary injunction to comply with the Ninth Circuit decision in <a href=\"../../../../case/43966/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Johnson v. City of Grants Pass, Oregon</a>, 72 F.4th 868 (9th Cir. 2023), which <a href=\"../../../../case/43966/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">found</a> that it is an Eighth Amendment violation &ldquo;to criminally punish involuntarily homeless persons for sleeping in public if there are no other public areas or appropriate shelters where those individuals can sleep.&rdquo; Id. at 877. Accordingly, defendants remained enjoined from enforcing the Camping and Sleeping Bans or seizing property to the extent requested in their motion to modify the preliminary injunction.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>In January 2024, the court scheduled oral argument on the intervenors&rsquo; Motion to Dismiss for March 29, 2024. Also in January, the Supreme Court of the United States granted certiorari in <a href=\"../../../../case/43966/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Johnson v. City of Grants Pass, Oregon</a>. The Court will hear oral argument for that case in April.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On March 29, 2024, the court denied inventors&rsquo; Motion to Dismiss as moot and ordered the plaintiffs to amend their complaint within 30 days. On April 29, 2024, the plaintiffs submitted a second amended complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief, adding more individuals as plaintiffs and one additional defendant in her official capacity as Director of the Office of Homeless Solutions (OHS). The second amended complaint detailed the role of OHS (which was created to generate transparency around the homelessness crisis and to implement a system for items taken by the City from those who are unhoused) in working with the Phoenix Police Department to conduct &ldquo;clean sweeps.&rdquo; The second amended complaint had an additional claim that the defendants violated the Eighth Amendment by imposing excessive fines on individuals for violating the Sleeping Ban, Camping Ban, and Trespassing Bans.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On May 28, defendants filed a motion to dismiss plaintiffs&rsquo; cruel and unusual punishment, excessive force, municipal liability, and state created danger claims.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On June 24, 2024, the court granted the parties&rsquo; stipulation to hold defendants&rsquo; Motion to Dismiss in abeyance so plaintiffs could again amend their complaint.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On June 28, 2024, the Supreme Court of the United States announced its decision in Johnson v. City of Grants Pass, Oregon, which reversed the Ninth Circuit&rsquo;s holding and held that enforcing bans on camping on public property was not prohibited by the Eighth Amendment&rsquo;s prohibition against &ldquo;cruel and unusual punishment.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>In response to the Supreme Court&rsquo;s decision in Grants Pass, the plaintiffs filed their third amended complaint on July 12, 2024 to withdraw the claim that the city&rsquo;s enforcement of the Camping and Sleeping Bans violated the Eighth Amendment. On July 18, 2024, defendants filed a motion to dissolve the preliminary injunction order. The defendants argued that dissolving the preliminary injunction was warranted not only because of the change in law, but also because of changes in fact: &ldquo;the Zone&rdquo; had been dismantled and the city adopted policies for the treatment of property inside and outside of &ldquo;the Zone.&rdquo; On July 26, the defendants also filed a motion to dismiss the claim for excessive fines and the claim for state-created danger.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs responded to the motion to dissolve the preliminary injunction order on August 1, 2024, conceding that &ldquo;there may no longer be a basis for the first prohibition on enforcement of the Camping and Sleeping Bans,&rdquo; but that the other two prohibitions under the injunction were unaffected by Grants Pass because they were rooted in distinct constitutional provisions&ndash;the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments, not the Eighth.</p>\r\n<p>As of November 9, 2024, this case is ongoing.</p>",

Phoenix is one of the epicenters of the homelessness crisis gripping the United \n13  States. Since 2010, the number of people experiencing homelessness in the city of Phoenix \n14  has more than doubled, and the crisis shows no sign of abating.1  The number of people \n15  experiencing chronic homelessness in Maricopa County (the โCountyโ) increased by 103% \n16  from 2017 to 2023.2 Meanwhile, instead of taking responsibility for its role in creating this \n17  crisis, Defendant the City of Phoenix (the โCityโ) has continued to exacerbate the problem \n18  by punishing its thousands of unhoused residents.3   \n19 \n20 \n \n1  Compare  Maricopa  Assโn  of  Govโts,  2010  Homeless  Street  Count, \n21 \nhttps://www.azmag.gov/Portals/0/Documents/MagContent/2010%20Point%20in%20Time\n22  %20Count%20for%20AZ-502%20(Municipal%20Street%20Count).pdf?ver=2017-07-07-\n134153-897 (recording approximately 1,750 unhoused individuals) with Maricopa Assโn of \n23 \nGovโts,  2023  Point-in-Time  (PIT)  Count  Report  4, \n24  https://azmag.gov/Portals/0/Homelessness/PIT-Count/2023/2023-PIT-Count-Report-\nFinal.pdf?ver=8CRzv7xw28C-V2G0sMdKfw%3D%3D (recording over 3,333 unhoused \n25 \nindividuals). \n26  2 2023 Point-in-Time (PIT) Count Report, supra note 1 at 3. \n27  3  Throughout  this  complaint  the  terms  โunhoused,โ  โhomeless,โ  and  โexperiencing \nhomelessnessโ denote individuals who meet the federal law definition of homelessness. See \n28 \n42  U.S.C.  ยง 11302;  24  C.F.R.  ยง  582.5.  The  use  of  the  term  โunshelteredโ  refers  to \n     \n- 2 - \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02041-GMS   Document 145   Filed 04/29/24   Page 3 of 42\n \n1  2.  Every year, a growing number of Phoenix residents find themselves unable to \n2  afford a home. This is largely due to skyrocketing housing costs. From 2017 to 2023, the \n3  median rent in Phoenix increased by 54%.4 Because Phoenix does not have sufficient \n4  shelter, many of those who find themselves unhoused have no choice but to take to the cityโs \n5  streets and other public areas. Indeed, in 2023, over half of Maricopa Countyโs unhoused \n6  population was unsheltered.5  \n7  3.  From the elements alone, these individuals face brutal conditions. In the \n8  summer, for example, temperatures average over 100 degrees Fahrenheit and can soar up \n9  to 119 degrees.6 Between June 30 and July 30 of 2023, Phoenix experienced a record-\n10  breaking 31 consecutive days over 110 degrees Fahrenheit.7 The summer sun bakes the \n11  asphalt, concrete, and other surfaces that make up the cityโs public areas, making scarce any \n12  places of refuge. As a result, hundreds of unsheltered individuals, who are at high risk of \n13  exposure to the elements because they have nowhere else to go, die each year from heat-\n14  related illnesses.8 \n15  4.  As if these conditions alone were not bad enough, unhoused individuals who \n16  involuntarily sleep in Phoenixโs public areas also face harassment and mistreatment by the \n17 \n \n18 \nindividuals who are experiencing homelessness and reside in a place that it not intended for \nhuman habitation (e.g., streets, cars, etc.).  \n19 \n4 Alex Horowitz and Tushar Kansal, Restrictive Zoning is Raising Housing Costs and \n20 \nHomelessness  in  Arizona,  Pew  Charitable  Trusts    (Dec.  7,  2023),  \n21  https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/articles/2023/12/07/restrictive-\nzoning-is-raising-housing-costs-and-homelessness-in-arizona. \n22 \n5  Point-In-Time  Homelessness  Count,  Maricopa  Assโn  of  Govโts.,  \n23  https://azmag.gov/Programs/Homelessness/Data/Point-In-Time-Homelessness-Count (last \nvisited April 28, 2024).  \n24 \n6 Phoenix Hit 110 Degrees on 54 Days in 2023, Setting Another Heat Record, PBS News \n25 \nHour (Sept. 10, 2023, 10:57 a.m.), https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/phoenix-hit-110-\ndegrees-on-54-days-in-2023-setting-another-heat-record. \n26 \n7 See Jack Healy, Phoenixโs Month in Hell: A 31-Day Streak of Record Heat Ends, N.Y. \n27 \nTimes (July 31, 2023), https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/31/us/phoenix-heat-july.html \n28 \n8 Phoenix Hit 110 Degrees on 54 Days in 2023, supra note 6.  \n     \n- 3 - \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02041-GMS   Document 145   Filed 04/29/24   Page 4 of 42\n \n1  City in violation of their constitutional rights. People who do nothing more than lay down \n2  on the Cityโs streets because they have nowhere else to rest their heads are threatened, \n3  detained, fined, and arrested for violating city ordinances or state law. The City also takes \n4  or destroys the few personal effects these unhoused individuals have, leaving no opportunity \n5  to retrieve those effects.  \n6  5.  The Cityโs answer to the homelessness crisis has been to have the Phoenix \n7  Police Department (โPPDโ) cite, arrest, and detain people for merely existing on the cityโs \n8  streets, targeting unhoused individuals for enforcement of the Cityโs ordinances against \n9  sleeping and โcampingโ9 in public, and using other statutes and ordinances like those \n10  prohibiting trespassing as a subterfuge for forcing unhoused individuals out of the city. \n11  These statutes and ordinances make it unlawful to sleep anywhere in the City at any time. \n12  For involuntarily unhoused10 individuals, who have no choice but to live and sleep in public, \n13  these statutes and ordinances essentially make it a crime to exist within Phoenixโs city \n14  limits. \n15  6.  The City created the Office of Homeless Solutions (โOHSโ) in 2022. OHS \n16  was originally intended to create transparency about the cityโs homelessness crisis. OHS \n17  was also tasked with creating and implementing a storage policy and system for items taken \n18  by the City from those who are unhoused, but has failed to adhere to the announced \n19  procedure. Instead, OHS has worked hand-in-hand with PPD to ratify and systematically \n20 \n21 \n22 \n \n23  9 The Cityโs โcampingโ prohibition prohibits the use of โthe real property of the Cityโ for \nโsleeping activities,โ so it may as well be a sleeping ban. See Phx., Ariz. City Code ยง 23-\n24 \n30. \n25  10 The term โinvoluntarily unhousedโ is synonymous to the term โinvoluntarily homeless,โ \nas defined by the Ninth Circuit. See Johnson v. City of Grants Pass, 72 F.4th 868, 875 n.2  \n26 \n(9th Cir. 2023), cert. granted, 144 S. Ct. 679 (2024) (โPersons are involuntarily homeless \n27  if they do not โhave access to adequate temporary shelter, whether because they have the \nmeans to pay for it or because it is realistically available to them for free.โโ (citing Martin \n28 \nv. City of Boise, 920 F.3d 584, 617 n.8 (9th Cir. 2019))). \n     \n- 4 - \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02041-GMS   Document 145   Filed 04/29/24   Page 5 of 42\n \n1  conduct โclean sweeps,โ which are raids that target people experiencing homelessness and \n2  violate their constitutional rights.11  \n3  7.  The Cityโs enforcement of these laws criminalizes, punishes, and scatters the \n4  homeless population based on their status as unsheltered. The City conducts raids of \n5  homeless encampments despite knowing that these individuals have nowhere else to go, \n6  given the dearth of affordable housing and emergency shelter space.12 \n7  8.  But  the  City  does  not  stop  at  criminalizing  residents  based  on  their \n8  unsheltered status. The City and its agents also indiscriminately and irretrievably seize, \n9  impound, and destroy unsheltered individualsโ personal property and survival gear without \n10  notice, cause, or a warrant. \n11  9.  During these raids, unsheltered individuals, including Plaintiffs and members \n12  of  Plaintiff  Fund  For  Empowerment  (โFFEโ)  have  lost  clothing,  survival  equipment, \n13  medication, items of sentimental value (like photographs of loved ones), and, perhaps most \n14  inexplicably, vital records and identifying documentsโlike birth certificates and reference \n15  lettersโwhich are crucial to procuring jobs, benefits, and housing. These documents can \n16  be almost impossible for someone with no fixed address to replace.13 \n17  10.  The Cityโs raids also place unsheltered individuals, including Plaintiffs and \n18  members of Plaintiff FFE, at greater risk of heat-related illness and death. Even when \n19  temperatures exceed 90 degrees, the City often provides mere minutes for people to gather \n20 \n \n21 \n11  At  various  times,  the  City  has  used  other  terms,  including  โenhanced  cleanups,โ \nโencampment cleanups,โ and โenhanced engagements,โ to describe this policy, custom, or \n22 \npractice. \n23 \n12 See Madeline Ackley, Phoenix Still Criminalizes Homelessness, Despite Court Ruling, \n24  Protesters  Say,  AZ  Mirror,  (Jan.  9,  2020,  9:13  a.m.), \nhttps://www.azmirror.com/2020/01/09/phoenix-still-criminalizes-homelessness-despite-\n25 \ncourt-ruling-protesters-say/. \n26  13 See Bailey Miller, โIt Is Simply Inhumaneโ: Phoenix Homeless Advocates Criticize City \nSweeps  of  Encampments,  FOX  10  Phx.

The stress and physical exertion this causes can prove \n2  dangerous in such high temperatures, especially for elderly and disabled individuals. The \n3  raids also often target individuals in shaded areas, forcing them out of relatively cool areas \n4  to wander  through the City in the direct sun. And the Cityโs destruction of survival \n5  equipment, like tents or tarps that provide some protection from the sun, also increases \n6  unhoused individualsโ exposure to dangerous temperatures.  \n7  11.  All told, instead of confronting its housing crisis head-on and investing in \n8  sustainable solutions to homelessness, the City is terrorizing the very people it should be \n9  helping.  The  City  is  knowingly  penalizing  unsheltered  residents  for  engaging  in \n10  unavoidable human activities like sleeping and sheltering from the elements. It has also \n11  weaponized โclean sweepsโ to drive unhoused people from Phoenix by making the cityโs \n12  public areas unlivable. The City has made its message to unhoused individuals clear:  \n13  engaging in sleep and other essential life activities on the cityโs public grounds will lead to \n14  detention, arrest, displacement, and the loss of the individualโs personal effects. The Cityโs \n15  actions  are  unconstitutional,  especially  in  light  of  the  fact  that  many  of  the  affected \n16  individuals, including Plaintiff FFEโs members and individual Plaintiffs here, have no \n17  choice  but to live in  the cityโs public areas, as the City  has fallen well short of its \n18  responsibility to provide adequate shelter to meet the needs of its unhoused population.14 \n19  JURISDICTION & VENUE \n20  12.

Plaintiff Fund for Empowerment (โFFEโ) is an incorporated nonprofit charity \n9  operating in the County that commonly expends time, energy, effort, and resources on \n10  behalf of the unsheltered population. FFEโs mission is to build community resources for the \n11  unsheltered population via direct services, capacity-building training, and project support. \n12  FFE  helps  protect  and  advocate  for  the  dignity,  rights,  and  choices  of  Arizonans \n13  experiencing homelessness or housing insecurity. FFE commits its efforts toward goals \n14  affirmed and raised by unsheltered individuals. FFEโs members include both the currently \n15  and formerly unhoused, including specifically people who are involuntarily unhoused, as \n16  well as allies looking to support unhoused people who lack shelter. FFE emphasizes the \n17  voices of the unsheltered to expose root causes of homelessness and to create ways of living \n18  in which everyone has a safe place they can call home. \n19  17.  Plaintiff Ronnie Massingille is currently involuntarily unhoused and lives in \n20  Phoenix, Arizona. Mr. Massingille cannot practically obtain shelter, much less a fixed, \n21  regular, and adequate nighttime residence. Although Mr. Massingille is sometimes able to \n22  obtain a shelter bed at St. Vincent de Paul, on most nights, he must sleep on the street. Mr. \n23  Massingille has received criminal citations from PPD for sleeping and camping in public \n24  and has directly experienced the raids performed by the City and PPD which have resulted \n25  in the destruction of his personal property. \n26  18.  Plaintiff Mohamed Sissoho is currently involuntarily unhoused and lives in \n27  Phoenix, Arizona. Mr. Sissoho cannot practically obtain shelter, much less a fixed, regular, \n28 \n     \n- 7 - \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02041-GMS   Document 145   Filed 04/29/24   Page 8 of 42\n \n1  and adequate nighttime residence. Mr. Sissohoโs property was destroyed during sweeps \n2  conducted by the City. Mr. Sissoho has also been cited by the City for sleeping in public.  \n3  19.  Plaintiff Dyrwood Moore is currently involuntarily unhoused and lives in \n4  Phoenix, Arizona. Mr. Moore cannot practically obtain shelter, much less a fixed, regular, \n5  and adequate nighttime residence. Mr. Moore has had his property destroyed during sweeps \n6  conducted by the City and has been repeatedly harassed by the PPD for sleeping in public \n7  places.  \n8  20.  Plaintiff Faith Kearns is a chronically unsheltered individual who resides in \n9  Maricopa County, Arizona. Ms. Kearns has directly experienced the raids performed by the \n10  City and PPD, which have resulted in the destruction of her personal property. \n11  21.  Plaintiff Frank Urban has been chronically unsheltered off and on since 2000 \n12  in Maricopa County, Arizona. Mr. Urban has received criminal citations from PPD for \n13  trespassing, obstructing a thoroughfare, and simply standing on the sidewalk in connection \n14  to his unsheltered status. Mr. Urban has directly experienced the raids performed by the \n15  City and PPD, which have resulted in the destruction of his personal property. \n16  22.  Plaintiff Timothy James is currently involuntarily unhoused and lives in \n17  Phoenix, Arizona. Mr. James cannot practically obtain shelter, much less a fixed, regular, \n18  and adequate nighttime residence. Mr. James has been cited multiple times by the City of \n19  Phoenix within the past month for sleeping and lying down in public spaces.  \n20  23.  Plaintiff  Sherdina  Carr  is  currently  involuntarily  unhoused  and  lives  in \n21  Phoenix, Arizona. Ms. Carr cannot practically obtain shelter, much less a fixed, regular, and \n22  adequate nighttime residence. Ms. Carr has been threatened her with citation or arrest.  \n23  24.  Plaintiff Papy Abdul Idrissa is currently involuntarily unhoused and lives in \n24  Phoenix, Arizona. Mr. Idrissa cannot practically obtain shelter, much less a fixed, regular, \n25  and adequate nighttime residence. Mr. Idrissa is often harassed by PPD for being unhoused, \n26  nearly on a daily basis.  \n27  25.  Plaintiff Jason Rich is currently involuntarily unhoused and lives in Phoenix, \n28  Arizona. Mr. Rich cannot practically obtain shelter, much less a fixed, regular, and adequate \n     \n- 8 - \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02041-GMS   Document 145   Filed 04/29/24   Page 9 of 42\n \n1  nighttime residence. Mr. Rich has been cited for violation of City ordinances. Mr. Rich does \n2  not believe there is anywhere safe for him to sleep in Phoenix.  \n3  26.  Defendant City of Phoenix is a political subdivision of the state of Arizona \n4  that acts through its employees, agents, and independent contractors. PPD is a department \n5  or division of the City that acts with the Cityโs authority.  \n6  26.  Defendant Michael Sullivan (โChief Sullivanโ) resides or works in Maricopa \n7  County, Arizona. \n8  27.  Chief Sullivan is the Interim Chief of Police for the PPD with ultimate \n9  authority to control, and responsibility for, the actions of its officers and agents. Chief \n10  Sullivan also has the authority and responsibility to establish policies, practices, customs, \n11  procedures, protocols, and training for the PPD. Chief Sullivan is named herein in his \n12  official capacity. \n13  28.  Defendant Rachel Milne (โDirector Milneโ) resides or works in Maricopa \n14  County, Arizona. \n15  29.  Director Milne is the Director of the OHS with ultimate authority to control, \n16  and responsibility for, the actions of its employees and agents. Defendant Milne also has \n17  the  authority  and  responsibility  to  establish  policies,  practices,  customs,  procedures, \n18  protocols, and training for the OHS. Defendant Milne is named herein in her official \n19  capacity.  \n20  GENERAL FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \n21  Background \n22  30.  The number of residents experiencing homelessness in Phoenix has more than \n23  doubled  since  2010  according  to  Point-in-Time  (โPITโ)  counts  commissioned  by  the \n24  Maricopa Association of Governments.15   \n25 \n26 \n27 \n \n28  15 See 2010 Homeless Street Count, supra note 1.  \n     \n- 9 - \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02041-GMS   Document 145   Filed 04/29/24   Page 10 of 42\n \n1  31.  This increase directly relates to the Cityโs lack of affordable housing for \n2  residents that was exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic.16 \n3  27.  Sustainable solutions to this spike in homelessness, including affordable \n4  housing, have lagged far behind, in large part because of the Cityโs inaction. For example, \n5  when this lawsuit was filed in November 2022, the City had spent less than 10% of the \n6  $99.5 million it received from the federal government through the American Rescue Plan \n7  Act (โARPAโ) in order to address homelessness and affordable housing.17 The City still has \n8  not spent more than half of the ARPA funds it budgeted for these purposes.18 \n9  28.  Without an adequate supply of affordable housing, Phoenix residents can \n10  easily become unsheltered  after disruptions  in household income  caused  by job loss, \n11  medical bankruptcy, emergency, mental illness, divorce, or domestic violence. \n12  29.  Black, Indigenous, and other people of color are disproportionately affected \n13  by  the  homelessness  crisis.  In  Maricopa  County,  Black  people  make  up  28%  of  the \n14  unhoused population, but only 6% of the general population. The Indigenous proportion of \n15  the  homeless  population  in  the  County  is  more  than  twice  its  share  of  the  general \n16  population.19 \n17 \n18 \n \n19  16 Median home prices in Phoenix metro area have risen over 216% since 2000, while the \nmedian income has grown only 48%. It is estimated that by 2025 only a third of the areaโs \n20 \npopulation will be able to afford a home.

This increase has \n22 \nalso caused a corresponding increase in rental prices.

Notwithstanding  the  fact  that  shelters  are  only  a  temporary  solution  to \n2  homelessness, the Cityโs efforts to supply temporary shelter fall far short of the need. \n3  According to the January 2022 Point-in-Time count, which considerably undercounts the \n4  unsheltered population, 2,942 people in Phoenix were temporarily housed in an emergency \n5  shelter  or  transitional  housing  while  3,096  people  in  Phoenix  remained  completely \n6  unsheltered.20 By 2023, according to the Point-in-Time count, the number of unsheltered \n7  people in Phoenix increased to 3,333, while the number of people in Phoenix temporarily \n8  housed in an emergency shelter or transitional housing increased to 3,569.21 \n9  33.  From 2020 to 2022, the unsheltered subset of the homeless population in the \n10  County, which includes Phoenix, grew by 34%. This means that the total number of \n11  unsheltered people in the County surpasses the number of this population in shelters (5,029 \n12  to 3,997).22 \n13  34.  While  the  2023  Maricopa  County  Point-in-Time  count  identified  9,642 \n14  people experiencing homelessness on a single night,23 almost 31,000 people experienced \n15  homelessness in Maricopa County over the course of the 2023 calendar year.24 There are \n16  only 4,700 total shelter beds  in Maricopa  County.25 As the Maricopa Association of \n17 \n18   \n20  Maricopa  Assโn  of  Govโts,  2022  Point-in-Time  (PIT)  Count  Report  4-5, \n19 \nhttps://azmag.gov/Portals/0/Documents/MagContent/2022-PIT-Count-Report-Final.pdf. \n20  21 2023 Point-in-Time (PIT) Count Report, supra note 1 at 4. \n21  22 See 2022 Point-in-Time (PIT) Count Report, supra note 20, at 1, 4-5. \n23 2023 Point-in-Time (PIT) Count Report supra note 1 at 1.

For its part, Phoenix only had 1,492 shelter beds available at the end of \n4  2021.27 According to the City, in 2022 and 2023, Phoenix added 1,072 shelter beds,28 which \n5  means that the city had, at most, 2,564 beds by the end of 2023โstill not nearly enough to \n6  provide shelter to the nearly 7,000 unhoused residents identified in the 2023 Point-in-Time \n7  count.29 \n8  40.  Despite  the  already  inadequate  number  of  shelter  beds  available,  OHS \n9  announced that it closed the โTemporary Haven,โ operated by Central Arizona Shelter \n10  Services (โCASSโ), which โserved 73 unique individuals,โ and also reported that โ[o]ther \n11  temporary lodging sites are slated for closure in the next few months and into fall 2024.โ30 \n12  40.  Many shelters are also inaccessible to people with certain disabilities or \n13  limited to individuals that meet certain eligibility requirements, and thus are not available \n14  to everyone experiencing homelessness in Phoenix. This leaves many with no alternative to \n15  existing and sleeping in public, as the shelters without such criteria have limited space with \n16  rare availability.  \n17  41.  Moreover, while emergency shelters can temporarily accommodate some \n18  people experiencing homelessness, they are not an adequate response to Phoenixโs rapid \n19 \n \n26 Id. \n20 \n27 City of Phoenix, Strategies to Address Homelessness: Task Force Recommendations to \n21 \nthe  City  Manager  14  (2022),  https://www.phoenix.gov/humanservicessite/Documents/ \nTask%20Force%20Recommendations%20to%20the%20City%20Manager-Final.pdf. \n22 \n28Office of Homeless Solutions, City of Phx. https://www.phoenix.gov/solutions (last visited \n23 \nApr. 28, 2024).  \n24 \n29 The 2023 Point-in-Time Report identified 3,569 people in Phoenix who were temporarily \nhoused in an emergency shelter or transitional housing and 3,333 individuals who were \n25 \ncompletely unsheltered. 2023 Point-in-Time (PIT) Count Report, supra note 1 at 4-5. \n26 \n30  See  City  of  Phoenix,  Office  of  Homeless  Solutions  Program  Report,  in  General \n27  Information  Packet  3,  4  (Apr.  18,  2024), \nhttps://www.phoenix.gov/cityclerksite/City%20Council%20Meeting%20Files/4-18-\n28 \n24%20General%20Info%20Packet-FINAL.pdf.  \n     \n- 12 - \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02041-GMS   Document 145   Filed 04/29/24   Page 13 of 42\n \n1  increase in unsheltered residents. For example, providing someone who is involuntarily \n2  unhoused with a shelter bed or motel room for one night does not resolve their status as \n3  involuntarily  unhoused.  Research  shows  that  the  most  effective  way  to  end  chronic \n4  homelessness is to provide permanent supportive housing on a housing-first basis.31 \n5  42.  Without  access  to  shelter  or  affordable  housing,  many  experiencing \n6  homelessness in Phoenix, including the Plaintiffs, those served by FFE, and members of \n7  FFE, have nowhere else to go. They are involuntarily unhoused. \n8  The Cityโs Raids \n9  43.  For at least the past three years, the City has had a policy, custom, or practice \n10  of systematically conducting raids it calls โclean sweepsโ of areas occupied by unsheltered \n11  individuals and those experiencing homelessness. \n12  44.  During these raids, it is a City policy, custom, or practice to rouse unsheltered \n13  individuals (including Plaintiffs, those served by FFE, and FFE members) in the early \n14  morning hours and order them to pack up their blankets, tents, and all their personal \n15  belongings. \n16  45.  Plaintiffs, FFEโs members, and other individuals who are served by FFE are \n17  not provided notification of when these raids will occur. \n18  46.  Some of these raids occur as early as 3:00 AM. \n19  47.  The City directs the PPD, Environmental Services, and other City agencies \n20  and contractors acting as โclean-upโ crews, to remove property. \n21  48.  Unsheltered individuals (including Plaintiffs, those served by FFE, and FFE \n22  members) typically have just minutes to gather their personal possessions and belongings \n23  before the raid begins. Because mere minutes are not enough time to gather and relocate \n24  possessions (particularly for people with disabilities), the inevitable result of the Cityโs raids \n25 \n26   \n31 See, e.g., U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness, ALL IN: The Federal Strategic \n27 \nPlan  to  Prevent  and  End  Homelessness  42  (Dec.  2022)., \n28  https://www.usich.gov/sites/default/files/document/All_In.pdf. \n     \n- 13 - \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02041-GMS   Document 145   Filed 04/29/24   Page 14 of 42\n \n1  is that people permanently lose any property they cannot immediately carry away with \n2  them.  \n3  49.  The  PPD,  City  workers,  and/or  โclean-upโ  crews  begin  indiscriminately \n4  removing and destroying any items that individuals have been unable to gather and move \n5  in the short time allowed. \n6  50.  Removal is performed with rakes, garbage bags, loaders, and sometimes a \n7  disposal truck. \n8  51.  These raids commonly result in the loss and destruction of personal property \n9  owned by those experiencing homelessness. Some of these items are necessary for survival, \n10  including tents, shades for heat relief, sleeping bags, medication, and blankets. \n11  52.  Because of these raids, individuals (including Plaintiffs, those served by FFE, \n12  and FFE members) frequently experience destruction of items difficult to replace such as \n13  personal IDs, photographs of family members and loved ones, and, in one case, even a set \n14  of teeth. \n15  53.  Upon information and belief, the purpose of these raids is to discourage \n16  individuals experiencing homelessness from sleeping in the City and to push them to other \n17  surrounding municipalities surrounding Phoenix in the County. \n18  54.  Upon information and belief, the Cityโs policy is to use these raids to address \n19  the rise in those experiencing homelessness to divert criticism for failing to adequately \n20  provide both emergency and permanent housing. \n21  The Cityโs Weaponization of Statutes and Ordinances to Criminalize Homelessness \n22  55.  During the Cityโs raids, which are conducted in accordance with the City and \n23  PPDโs policies, practices, and customs, police officers often issue criminal citations under \n24  the Arizona Revised Statutes and City Ordinances. \n25  56.  The City has cited individuals for violations of Phoenix City Code ยง 23-30 \n26  (the โCamping Banโ), Phoenix City Code ยง 23-48.01 (the โSleeping Banโ), Phoenix City \n27  Code ยง 23-85.01 and Arizona Revised Statutes ยง 13-1501 et seq. (together with Phoenix \n28  City Code ยง 23-85.01, the โTrespassing Bansโ).  \n     \n- 14 - \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02041-GMS   Document 145   Filed 04/29/24   Page 15 of 42\n \n1  57.  The Camping Ban provides: โIt shall be unlawful for any person to camp in \n2  any park or preserve, or in any building, facility, or parking lot or structure, or on any \n3  property adjacent thereto, that is owned, possessed and controlled by the City . . . .โ Phx., \n4  Ariz., City Code ยง 23-30(A). \n5  58.  According to the City, camping means โto use real property of the City for \n6  living accommodation purposes such as sleeping activities, or making preparations to sleep, \n7  including the laying down of bedding for the purpose of sleeping, or storing personal \n8  belongings, or making any fire, or using any tents or shelter or other structure or vehicle for \n9  sleeping or doing any digging or earth breaking or carrying on cooking activities.โ Id. ยง 23-\n10  30(B). \n11  59.  As indicated in the Cityโs definition of the term โcamp,โ the Camping Ban \n12  punishes and criminalizes the act of sleeping by unsheltered individuals within the City. \n13  60.  The  Camping  Ban  is  commonly  cited  by  the  City  against  unsheltered \n14  individuals during raids to discourage basic human activities such as sleeping. \n15  61.  The Sleeping Ban provides: โIt shall be unlawful for any person to use a \n16  public street, highway, alley, lane, parkway, sidewalk or other right-of-way, whether such \n17  right-of-way has been dedicated to the public in fee or by easement, for lying, sleeping or \n18  otherwise remaining in a sitting position thereon, except in the case of a physical emergency \n19  or the administration of medical assistance.โ Id. ยง 23-48.01. \n20  62.  The Sleeping Ban is broad and prohibits sleeping on areas of City property \n21  otherwise unused by pedestrians. \n22  63.  The  Sleeping  Ban  is  commonly  cited  by  the  City  against  unsheltered \n23  individuals during raids to discourage universal and unavoidable human activities such as \n24  sleeping. \n25  64.  The Trespassing Bans prohibit:  \n26 \n27 \n28 \n     \n- 15 - \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02041-GMS   Document 145   Filed 04/29/24   Page 16 of 42\n \n1  a)  Entering or remaining unlawfully on any real property after a reasonable \nrequest to leave by the owner or any other person having lawful control \n2 \nover such property, or reasonable notice prohibiting entry.  \n3 \nb)  Entering or remaining unlawfully in the right-of-way for tracks, or the \n4  storage or switching yards or rolling stock of a railroad company.  \n5 \nc)  Entering or remaining unlawfully on any residential structure or fenced \ncommercial yard.  \n6 \n7  d)  Entering or remaining unlawfully in a residential structure or fenced \nresidential yard.  \n8 \ne)  Entering any residential yard without lawful authority, looking into the \n9  residential structure thereon with the intent to infringe on the inhabitantโs \nright of privacy.  \n10 \n11  Id. ยง 23-85.01; see also A.R.S. ยง 13-1502 (prohibiting โ[k]nowingly entering or remaining \n12  unlawfully on any real property after a reasonable request to leave by a law enforcement \n13  officer,  the  owner  or  any  other  person  having  lawful  control  over  such  property,  or \n14  reasonable notice prohibiting entryโ); id. ยง 13-1503 (prohibiting โknowingly entering or \n15  remaining unlawfully in or on any nonresidential structure or in any fenced commercial \n16  yardโ); id. ยง 13-1504 (prohibiting, inter alia, โentering or remaining unlawfully on a \n17  residential structureโ or on a โresidential yardโ).   \n18  65.  The City has enforced the Trespassing Bans against unhoused individuals, \n19  including Plaintiffs, members of FFE, and those served by FFE, for merely standing, sitting, \n20  lying, or sleeping in public spaces.  \n21  66.  These statutes and ordinances apply city-wide, meaning that there is no place \n22  in the City where unsheltered individuals can sleep or simply exist without breaking the \n23  law. \n24  67.  Violation of these ordinances is a Class 1 misdemeanor, punishable by a fine \n25  up to $2,500 per violation and imprisonment of up to six months.  See Phx. Ariz. City Code \n26  ยง 1-5.32  \n27   \n32 Violation of the Arizona Trespassing Ban is a Class 3 Misdemeanor punishable by a fine \n28 \nup to $500 or imprisonment up to 30 days. See A.R.S. ยง 13-802(C); A.R.S. ยง 13-707(A)(3).  \n     \n- 16 - \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02041-GMS   Document 145   Filed 04/29/24   Page 17 of 42\n \n1  74.  The City is imposing fines on individuals, including Plaintiffs, individuals \n2  served by FFE, and FFE members, for violating these statutes and ordinances even though \n3  they lack culpability because they have nowhere else to sit, lie, or sleep.  \n4  75.  Despite this Courtโs preliminary injunction (ECF No. 119) prohibiting the \n5  City from enforcing the Camping and Sleeping Bans against โhomeless persons for sleeping \n6  in public if there are no other public areas or appropriate shelters where those individuals \n7  can sleep,โ (ECF No. 119 at 3) the City has nevertheless continued to enforce those \n8  prohibitions against individuals who are involuntarily unhoused and practically cannot \n9  obtain shelter and who do not have access to any public place or appropriate shelter where \n10  they can safely or legally sleep or simply exist.  \n11  76.  The City has also circumvented the preliminary injunction by enforcing the \n12  Trespassing Bans against involuntarily unhoused individuals who practically cannot obtain \n13  shelter or access to any public place where they can sleep or carry out essential life activities \n14  without risking violation of the Camping, Sleeping, or Trespassing Bans (or any other City \n15  ordinances), for acts of so-called โtrespassโ that amount to little more than sleeping or living \n16  on public property.  \n17  77.  The Cityโs policy, practice, or custom is to use these statutes and ordinances \n18  to  criminalize  homelessness,  including  by  enforcing  them  against  people  who  are \n19  involuntarily unhoused. \n20  78.  Despite  neighboring  municipalities  amending  their  policies  and  halting \n21  enforcement of similar ordinances, the City has continued its policy, practice, or custom of \n22  enforcing its ordinances in an unconstitutional manner even when housing and temporary \n23  shelter are not practically available to its unhoused residents. \n24  79.  The city of Tempe, for example, admitted enforcement of its camping ban \n25  against unhoused people would be unconstitutional. \n26  80.  The city of Glendale amended its ordinance to prevent imposing criminal \n27  sanctions on camping โwhen no alternative shelter is available.โ Glendale, Ariz., City Code \n28  ยง 25-90. \n     \n- 17 - \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02041-GMS   Document 145   Filed 04/29/24   Page 18 of 42\n \n1  81.  The City of Phoenix, by contrast, has not amended its Camping Ban, Sleeping \n2  Ban, or its Trespassing Ban and continues to pursue its policy, practice, or custom of \n3  enforcing these laws against involuntarily unhoused individuals who practically cannot \n4  obtain shelter and who do not have access to any public place they can legally sleep, lie, \n5  stand, or sit in public, even though this Court has imposed an injunction prohibiting the City \n6  from doing so.33 \n7  82.  Upon information and belief, the City has a policy, practice, or custom of \n8  issuing  citations  to  individuals  for  violations  of  these  (and  other)  statutes/codes  to \n9  discourage individuals experiencing homelessness from sleeping in the City and to push \n10  them to other surrounding municipalities in the County. \n11  83.  Upon information and belief, the City has a policy, practice, or custom of \n12  using  these  statutes  and  ordinances  in  place  of  finding  humane  solutions  for  those \n13  experiencing homelessness within the City. \n14  Plaintiff Fund for Empowermentโs Work on Behalf of the Unsheltered Community \n15  84.  Since 2018, the Fund for Empowerment has spent monetary resources in \n16  support of its mission to help provide education, training, and leadership courses to the \n17  unsheltered community to combat policies and practices by the City which target them. \n18  85.  FFE  has  approximately  200  members,  many  of  whom  are  currently \n19  involuntarily unhoused or chronically at risk of becoming unsheltered.  \n20  86.  FFE commonly creates and prints written materials for dissemination to the \n21  unsheltered community which include information about their rights under the United States \n22  Constitution. \n23 \n \n33 Indeed, rather that turn away from criminalization as a โsolutionโ to its homelessness \n24 \ncrisis, the City has doubled down, introducing a new camping ban ordinance. See Collen \n25  Sikora, Proposed Change to Phoenixโs Camping Ordinance Would Ban Camping Within \n500  Feet  of  Certain  Places,  12  News  (Apr.  3,  2024,  6:40  p.m.), \n26 \nhttps://www.12news.com/article/news/local/valley/proposed-camping-ban-near-phoenix-\n27  schools-child-care-centers-shelters/75-a8a8234d-b8a3-4062-b2c3-3ceb2e3f9704. \nMembers of FFE expended time and resources advocating against this proposal at City \n28 \nCouncil hearings.  \n     \n- 18 - \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02041-GMS   Document 145   Filed 04/29/24   Page 19 of 42\n \n1  87.  FFE provides training to the unsheltered community about their rights in \n2  response to the raids conducted by the City. \n3  88.  FFE conducts bi-weekly sessions for the purpose of encouraging unsheltered \n4  people to advocate for themselves. Dozens of unsheltered people living in Phoenix attend \n5  these meetings. \n6  89.  Due to the Cityโs raids, a substantial portion of these meetings has been \n7  dedicated to identifying resources for unsheltered people impacted by the raids. \n8  90.  FFE provides training to the unsheltered community about their right to sleep \n9  outside in connection to the Cityโs use of statutes and ordinances to criminalize sleeping. \n10  91.  Since 2020, FFE has had to divert its resources to providing replacement \n11  safety items, such as tents and water, to individuals whose property was seized by the City \n12  during sweeps. FFE does this because unsheltered individuals may become ill if they do not \n13  have access to shade or water and are exposed to heat because of a sweep.  \n14  92.  FFE would not have to expend these resources on behalf of its members if the \n15  City  stopped  conducting  raids  and  using  statutes  and  ordinances  to  criminalize \n16  homelessness. \n17  93.  If FFE did not have to expend resources helping unsheltered individuals \n18  understand their rights in response to Defendants raids and criminal citations, FFE could \n19  spend  resources  training  unsheltered  individuals  to  become  their  own  advocates  in \n20  requesting resources from the City for housing and shelter. \n21  94.  If FFE did not have to expend resources helping unsheltered individuals \n22  understand their rights in response to Defendants raids and criminal citations, FFE could \n23  also distribute more water and food to the unsheltered community during the summer \n24  months. FFE could also provide more supplies to the unsheltered community which would \n25  improve individualsโ quality of life. \n26  FFE Membersโ Experiences \n27  95.  Plaintiff Timothy James is a resident of Phoenix, an FFE member, and an \n28  involuntarily unhoused individual.  \n     \n- 19 - \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02041-GMS   Document 145   Filed 04/29/24   Page 20 of 42\n \n1  96.   On March 29, 2024, PPD threatened to issue a citation against Mr. James for \n2  sleeping on the ground. \n3  97.  During  this encounter, PPD officers  followed Mr. James and repeatedly \n4  instructed him to take his belongings with him, or else face a citation. \n5  98.  In April 2024, PPD cited Mr. James multiple times for violations of the \n6  Trespassing Ban under Phoenix City Code ยง 23-48.01. \n7  99.  Plaintiff Sherdina Carr is a resident of Phoenix, an FFE member, and an \n8  involuntarily unhoused individual. \n9  100.  PPD threatened to issue a citation against Ms. Carr for sleeping on the ground \n10  and directed her to move.  \n11  101.  PPD officers followed Ms. Carr to her new location on a different block, and, \n12  under threat of citation, forced her to walk for over an hour to avoid receiving a citation \n13  from them.  \n14  102.  Plaintiff Papy Abdul Idrissa is a resident of Phoenix, an FFE member, and an \n15  involuntarily unhoused individual.  \n16  103.  PPD threatened to issue a citation against Mr. Idrissa for sleeping on the \n17  ground and directed him to move.  \n18  104.  PPD officers followed Mr. Idrissa to his new location on a different block. \n19  Mr. Idrissa walked for more than an hour to be out of PPDโs sights, and to no longer be \n20  subject to PPDโs threats of a citation.  \n21  105.  Plaintiff Faith Kearns is a resident of Phoenix and an FFE member and has \n22  been chronically unsheltered since approximately 2008. While sleeping within the City as \n23  an  involuntarily  unhoused  individual,  Ms.  Kearns  has  experienced  the  Cityโs  โclean \n24  sweeps,โ or raids, firsthand. \n25  106.  During one such raid, the PPD officers took Ms. Kearnsโ Arizona ID card, a \n26  Visa Card on which  her social security  disability income was loaded, tent, blankets, \n27  bedding, birth certificate, medications, and clothing. \n28 \n     \n- 20 - \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02041-GMS   Document 145   Filed 04/29/24   Page 21 of 42\n \n1  107.  Ms. Kearns also received citations from the City under the Camping Ban, and \n2  Sleeping Ban, and Trespassing Ban. \n3  108.  Plaintiff Frank Urban is a resident of Phoenix and an FFE member and has \n4  been chronically unsheltered off and on since 2000. \n5  109.  While sleeping outside as an involuntarily unhoused person in various parts \n6  of the City, Mr. Urban has directly experienced the Cityโs raids. \n7  110.  During the raids, PPD officers took Mr. Urbanโs Arizona ID card, tent, \n8  blankets, bedding, medications, clothing, food, and water. \n9  111.  Mr. Urban also received citations from the City under the Camping Ban and \n10  Sleeping Bans. \n11  Plaintiff Ronnie Massingilleโs Experience \n12  112.  Mr. Massingille is a resident of Maricopa County and currently resides in \n13  Phoenix.  \n14  113.  Mr. Massingille is currently involuntarily unhoused.  \n15  114.  Mr. Massingille commonly sleeps outside in various parts of the City. \n16  115.  While sleeping and encamped, Mr. Massingille has directly experienced the \n17  Cityโs raids and the actions of PPD.  \n18  116.  Mr. Massingilleโs possessions were seized and thrown away numerous times \n19  during the Cityโs sweeps. \n20  117.  He was never provided with a search warrant. \n21  118.  During the sweeps, PPD officers took Mr. Massingilleโs Arizona ID card, \n22  birth certificate, tent, a suitcase, clothes/shoes, skateboards, and medication.  \n23  119.  As an unsheltered individual in the City, Mr. Massingille lives with a constant \n24  fear PPD will arrest him, criminally cite him for sleeping outside, or destroy his property.  \n25  Plaintiff Mohamed Sissohoโs Experience  \n26  120.  Plaintiff Mohamed Sissoho is a resident of Phoenix.  \n27  121.  Mr. Sissoho is currently involuntarily unhoused. \n28  122.  Mr. Sissoho has unsuccessfully sought a shelter bed multiple times.   \n     \n- 21 - \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02041-GMS   Document 145   Filed 04/29/24   Page 22 of 42\n \n1  123.  In November 2022, Mr. Sissoho was at the corner of Jefferson Street and 11th \n2  Avenue when PPD conducted a raid.  \n3  124.  Mr. Sissoho received no advance notice that PPD or the City would be \n4  conducting a raid or any sort of operation.  \n5  125.  During this raid, PPD seized and destroyed Mr. Sissohoโs property without \n6  his consent and without a warrant.  \n7  126.  Specifically, PPD seized Mr. Sissohoโs tent, sleeping bags, food stamps, \n8  social security card, letters, and jewelry.  \n9  127.  PPD did not inform Mr. Sissoho how he could reclaim his property or even \n10  where it was being taken.  \n11  128.  Mr. Sissoho has not been able to recover the property that PPD seized from \n12  him. \n13  129.  Without his tent, it has been hard for Mr. Sissoho to protect himself from the \n14  sun and sweltering heat.  \n15  130.  In October 2023, Mr. Sissoho was sleeping in the area near 12th Avenue and \n16  Madison Street (formerly known as โthe Zoneโ). Mr. Sissoho recalls the City conducting a \n17  sweep in the early morning hours starting around 6:00 AM.  Mr. Sissoho recalls being \n18  roused by PPD officers who forced him, under threat of citation with the Trespassing Bans, \n19  to move elsewhere.  \n20  131.  During  this  sweep,  the  City  cited  Mr.  Sissoho  for  a  violation  of  the \n21  Trespassing Bans. \n22  132.  During this sweep, the City took the majority of his items, including his tent, \n23  clothes, and other survival items. Mr. Sissoho was never given information about how to \n24  recover these items. Because of the Cityโs sweeps, Mr. Sissoho only carries with him those \n25  items that he can tuck into the sides of his wheelchair. \n26  133.  In April 2024, PPD threatened Mr. Sissoho with a citation for sleeping in his \n27  wheelchair in public.  \n28 \n     \n- 22 - \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02041-GMS   Document 145   Filed 04/29/24   Page 23 of 42\n \n1  134.  PPD forced Mr. Sissoho to move elsewhere but did not provide Mr. Sissoho \n2  any assistance or information on services, resources, or shelters. \n3  135.  Mr. Sissoho is worried about the approaching summer and how he will \n4  survive the increasing heat without a tent (which provided shade to him).   \n5  Plaintiff Dyrwood Mooreโs Experience  \n6  136.  Plaintiff Dyrwood Moore is a resident of Phoenix, Arizona.  \n7  137.  Mr. Moore is currently involuntarily unhoused.  \n8  138.  In September 2023, Mr. Moore was living on Monroe Street, near the CASS \n9  Shelter when PPD conducted a raid without prior warning.  \n10  139.  Mr. Moore was not present during the September 2023 raid. He would not \n11  have left his belongings in and near his tent if he had received notice ahead of the raid.  \n12  140.  The City confiscated or destroyed Mr. Mooreโs belongings without providing \n13  him with a means to retrieve them.  \n14  141.  Specifically, PPD seized Mr. Mooreโs tent, clothes, barbeque grill, bicycle, \n15  and shoes. \n16  142.  Mr. Moore has not been able to retrieve his personal property since the Cityโs \n17  confiscation. \n18  143.  In March 2024, Mr. Moore was living near the corner of N. 22nd Avenue and \n19  West Portland Street when PPD conducted a raid without prior warning.  \n20  144.  Mr. Moore was not present during the March 2024 raid, but left his belongings \n21  in and near the tent where he was staying.   \n22  145.  The City confiscated or destroyed Mr. Mooreโs belongings without providing \n23  him with a means to retrieve them.   \n24  146.  Specifically,  PPD  seized  Mr.  Mooreโs  tent,  shade  for  heat  protection, \n25  disability documentation, blankets, clothes, food, and water.  \n26 \n147.  On March 14, 2024, Mr. Moore contacted OHS to see if he would be able to \n27 \nrecover his belongings. \n28 \n     \n- 23 - \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02041-GMS   Document 145   Filed 04/29/24   Page 24 of 42\n \n1  148.  OHS has not responded to Mr. Mooreโs inquiry. He remains without the \n2  belongings that PPD took from him during the March 2024 raid.  \n3  149.  Without his tent and shade for heat protection, it has been difficult for Mr. \n4  Moore to stay out of the direct sun.  \n5  150.  The increased heat experienced by Mr. Moore has at times caused him to feel \n6  faint and exhausted. As temperatures increase, he worries that the loss of his tent and shade \n7  will cause him to become ill.    \n8  Plaintiff Faith Kearnsโ Experience \n9  151.  Ms. Kearns is a resident of Phoenix, Arizona. \n10  152.  Due to various medical issues and the costs associated with medical care, she \n11  has been chronically unsheltered since approximately 2008. \n12  153.  When she is unsheltered, Ms. Kearns sleeps on the public streets of Phoenix. \n13  154.  While sleeping within the City as an unsheltered individual, Ms. Kearns has \n14  experienced the raids firsthand. Based on Ms. Kearnsโ recollection, the raids occurred about \n15  three to five days per week, with an uptick during and around holidays.  \n16  155.  During  the  Cityโs  raids,  Ms.  Kearns  has  had  personal  possessions  and \n17  belongings destroyed. \n18  156.  During the Cityโs raids, PPD and other City workers took the following from \n19  Ms. Kearns: an Arizona ID card, a Visa Card on which her Social Security disability income \n20  was loaded, tent, blankets, bedding, birth certificate, medications, and clothing. \n21  157.  Ms. Kearns watched as PPD and other City workers destroyed these items, \n22  among others.  \n23  158.  Ms. Kearns never received a search warrant for the property that the City \n24  seized through its agents. \n25  159.  Ms. Kearns also remembers receiving  citations from the  City  under the \n26  Jaywalking Law, Camping Ban, and Sleeping Ban. \n27  160.  Ms. Kearns has received other citations related to her unsheltered status such \n28  as a citation for trespassing. \n     \n- 24 - \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02041-GMS   Document 145   Filed 04/29/24   Page 25 of 42\n \n1  161.  Ms. Kearns believes the Cityโs raids are intended to push her out of the City. \n2  Plaintiff Frank Urbanโs Experience \n3  162.  Mr. Urban is a resident of Maricopa County and currently resides in Phoenix. \n4  163.  Due to various medical issues, Mr. Urban became chronically unsheltered off \n5  and on starting in 2000. \n6  164.  During the time periods when Mr. Urban has been unsheltered, he has slept \n7  outside in various parts of the City. \n8  165.  During these times, Mr. Urban has directly experienced the Cityโs raids. \n9  These raids intensified around Thanksgiving and Christmas.  \n10  166.  During the Cityโs raids, Mr. Urban has had his possessions thrown away \n11  numerous times. Specifically, PPD and other City workers took from him and destroyed: \n12  an Arizona ID card, tent, blankets, bedding, medications, clothing, food, and water. \n13  167.  Mr. Urban never received a search warrant for the property that the City \n14  seized through its agents. \n15  168.  Mr. Urban also recalls receiving citations from the City under the Camping \n16  Ban and Sleeping Ban. \n17  169.  Mr. Urban has received other citations from the City in connection to his \n18  unsheltered status. \n19  Plaintiff Timothy Jamesโs Experience \n20  170.   Mr. James is a resident of Phoenix, Arizona. \n21  171.  Mr. James is currently involuntarily unhoused. \n22  172.  Mr. James is constantly forced to move around the city to flee the PPDโs \n23  persistent harassment and threats against Mr. James for sitting or sleeping in public. \n24  173.  On April 3, 2024, PPD cited Mr. James for lying or sitting in public in \n25  violation of Phoenix City Code ยง 23-48.01. \n26  174.  On April 12, 2024, Mr. James was at the intersection of Jackson St. and 11th \n27  Avenue when PPD cited Mr. James for lying or sitting in public in violation of Phoenix \n28  City Code ยง 23-48.01. \n     \n- 25 - \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02041-GMS   Document 145   Filed 04/29/24   Page 26 of 42\n \n1  175.  After PPD cited Mr. James, they forced him to move elsewhere. \n2  176.   On April 19, 2024, Mr. James was woken up arrested by PPD for sleeping in \n3  public in violation of Phoenix City Code ยง 23-48.01.  \n4  177.  Mr. James spent the night in jail before being released.  \n5  178.  PPD did not provide Mr. James with any information on shelters, resources, \n6  or services during these encounters.  \n7  Plaintiff Sherdina Carrโs Experience \n8  179.   Ms. Carr is a resident of Phoenix, Arizona. \n9  180.  Ms. Carr is currently involuntarily unhoused. \n10  181.  Ms. Carr walks around the city for hours at a time to escape PPDโs harassment \n11  and threats. \n12  182.  After the closure of the Zone, Ms. Carr has been forced by PPD to relocate \n13  countless times.  \n14  183.  Recently, Ms. Carr was trying to find a shaded area to sit down when PPD \n15  threatened her with a citation unless she moved elsewhere. \n16  184.  PPD followed Ms. Carr while she was walking around trying to find a new \n17  location.  \n18  185.  Once Ms. Carr found a new location, PPD immediately threatened her with a \n19  citation unless she moved again.  \n20  186.  PPD, again, followed her while she walked around and looked for a third \n21  location to sit down. \n22  187.  PPD never offered Ms. Carr information on services, shelter, or resources.  \n23  Plaintiff Papy Abdul Idrissaโs Experience  \n24  188.   Mr. Idrissa is a resident of Phoenix, Arizona. \n25  189.   Mr. Idrissa is currently involuntarily unhoused.  \n26  190.  PPD forces Mr. Idrissa to relocate on a nearly daily basis. \n27  191.   On April 19, 2024, Mr. Idrissa was sitting in a shaded area of a park when \n28  PPD threatened Mr. Idrissa with a citation or arrest. \n     \n- 26 - \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02041-GMS   Document 145   Filed 04/29/24   Page 27 of 42\n \n1  192.   PPD forced Mr. Idrissa to leave the shaded area and relocate to an unshaded \n2  area. \n3  193.  Mr. Idrissa then walked to another shaded area where PPD again threatened \n4  Mr. Idrissa with a citation and arrest.  \n5  194.  PPD continued to follow, harass, and threaten Mr. Idrissa as he walked around \n6  trying to find another shaded area to sit.  \n7  195.  In February or March 2024, Mr. Idrissaโs friend was sleeping in the shade \n8  near the CASS Shelter when he was forced to move elsewhere.  \n9  196.  Mr. Idrissaโs friend relocated to the park at the intersection of 13th Avenue \n10  and Van Buren. \n11  197.  That same day, Mr. Idrissaโs friend died from sun/heat exposure.  \n12  198.  In April 2024, PPD harassed Mr. Idrissa and other unhoused people at a bus \n13  stop near 15th Avenue and Fillmore. During this incident, PPD threatened Mr. Idrissa and \n14  other unhoused individuals with citations and arrests. PPD then forced these individuals, \n15  including Mr. Idrissa, to leave the shaded bus stop, and onto areas unprotected from sun \n16  and heat exposure.  \n17  Plaintiff Jason Richโs Experience  \n18  199.   Mr. Rich is a resident of Phoenix, Arizona. \n19  200.  Mr. Rich is currently involuntarily unhoused.  \n20  201.  Around January 2024, Mr. Rich was sleeping on a bench when he was woken \n21  up by PPD sticking a taser in his back.  \n22  202.  While citing and arresting Mr. Rich, PPD seized all his personal property and \n23  belongings.  \n24  203.  Specifically,  PPD  seized  Mr.  Richโs  medications,  hygiene  supplies, \n25  cellphone, identification, and backpack.  \n26  204.  PPD did not let Mr. Rich inquire as to where his belongings were being taken. \n27  205.  During this incident, PPD did not provide Mr. Rich with any information on \n28  services, resources, or shelters. \n     \n- 27 - \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02041-GMS   Document 145   Filed 04/29/24   Page 28 of 42\n \n1  206.  After being released, PPD has often harassed Mr. Rich for sitting or lying in \n2  public.  \n3  207.  PPD has forced Mr. Rich to move late at night under the threat of a citation \n4  or arrest. \n5  208.  Around February 2024, Mr. Rich was near CASS around 5:00 a.m. when PPD \n6  began patrolling the area and citing unhoused persons.  \n7  209.  PPD threatened Mr. Rich with a citation for trespassing if he did not leave the \n8  area and move elsewhere. \n9  210.  PPD did not provide Mr. Rich with any information on services, resources, or \n10  shelters during these encounters.  \n11  CLAIMS FOR RELIEF \n12  Count One \n13  (Fourth Amendment ViolationโUnlawful Seizure) \n14  (42 U.S.C. ยง 1983) \n15  (All Defendants) \n16  211.  Plaintiffs re-allege the foregoing paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n17  212.  At all times relevant to the allegations in this Complaint, Defendants acted \n18  under color of state law. \n19  213.  Under  the  Fourth  Amendment  to  the  United  States  Constitution,  as \n20  incorporated against the states by the Fourteenth Amendment, Plaintiffs have the right to \n21  be secure in their persons against unreasonable seizures. A seizure of property occurs under \n22  the Fourth Amendment when there is some meaningful interference with an individualโs \n23  possessory  interests  in  that  property;  meaningful  interferences  include  destruction  of \n24  property. See United States v. Jacobsen, 466 U.S. 109, 113 (1984). \n25  214.  Property includes photographs, identification papers, portable electronics, \n26  and even potentially abandoned property. See Lavan v. City of Los Angeles, 693 F.3d 1022, \n27  1030 (9th Cir. 2012). \n28 \n     \n- 28 - \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02041-GMS   Document 145   Filed 04/29/24   Page 29 of 42\n \n1  215.  Here, Defendants, pursuant to the Cityโs policies, procedures, customs, and/or \n2  protocols, have engaged and will continue to engage in targeted raids of areas occupied by \n3  the unsheltered community. \n4  216.  During  these  raids,  Defendants  unreasonably  seize  and  destroy  property \n5  regardless of its condition, its apparent value, and/or whether or not it has been voluntarily \n6  abandoned. \n7  217.  Individual Plaintiffs as well as other unhoused people who are members of \n8  FFE or served by FFE, have experienced destruction of their personal items by Defendants \n9  including the destruction of photographs, identification papers, camping equipment, and \n10  other unabandoned personal items within the past three years. \n11  218.  Plaintiffs have seen the destruction of personal items of other unsheltered \n12  individuals including items deemed abandoned by Defendants within the past three years. \n13  219.  By seizing and destroying the property of the individual Plaintiffs, individuals \n14  served by FFE, and FFE members, Defendants meaningfully and permanently interfered \n15  with these individualsโ possessory interest in their property and unlawfully seized that \n16  property. \n17  220.  At no time did Defendants provide a warrant to seize the property of the \n18  individual Plaintiffs, individuals served by FFE, or of FFEโs members.  \n19  221.  Seizures without a warrant are presumptively unconstitutional. \n20  222.  Defendants engage in warrantless seizures of property when no exception to \n21  the warrant requirement applies. \n22  223.  Plaintiffs, individuals served by FFE, and FFEโs members have a possessory \n23  interest in their property under the Fourth Amendment. \n24  224.  A  reasonable  official  in  Interim  Chief  Sullivanโs  and  Director  Milneโs \n25  position would have known that seizing and destroying Plaintiffsโ property and the property \n26  of individuals served by FFE and FFE members constitutes a violation of the Fourth \n27  Amendment. \n28 \n     \n- 29 - \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02041-GMS   Document 145   Filed 04/29/24   Page 30 of 42\n \n1  225.  Defendantsโ actions were the direct and proximate cause of Plaintiffsโ loss of \n2  property and the loss of property of the individuals served by FFE and FFE members.  \n3  226.  The acts of Defendants were intentional and deprived Plaintiffs, individuals \n4  served by FFE, and FFE members of their rights, privileges, liberties, and immunities \n5  secured by the Constitution of the United States. \n6  227.  Plaintiffs are entitled to damages in an amount to be determined by a jury. \n7   \n8   \n9  Count Two \n10  (Fourteenth Amendment Violation โ Deprivation of Property without Due Process) \n11  (42 U.S.C. ยง 1983) \n12  (All Defendants) \n13  228.  Plaintiffs re-allege the foregoing paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n14  229.  The Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides that \n15  no state shall โdeprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.โ \n16  230.  Under the Fourteenth Amendment, โthe government may not take property \n17  like a thief in the night; rather, it must announce its intentions and give the property owner \n18  a chance to argue against the taking.โ Clement v. City of Glendale, 518 F.3d 1090, 1093 \n19  (9th Cir. 2008). \n20  231.  Violation of city ordinances does not constitute a waiver of due process \n21  interests in a previously recognized property interest. \n22  232.  The property of those experiencing homelessness is โpropertyโ within the \n23  meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment, meaning a government entity โmust comport with \n24  the requirements of the Fourteenth Amendmentโs due process clause if it wishes to take and \n25  destroy them.โ Lavan, 693 F.3d at 1032. \n26  233.  Here, Defendants, pursuant to the Cityโs policies, procedures, customs, and/or \n27  protocols, have engaged and will continue to engage in raids that targeted the unsheltered \n28  community living within the City. \n     \n- 30 - \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02041-GMS   Document 145   Filed 04/29/24   Page 31 of 42\n \n1  234.  Pursuant  to  the  Cityโs  policies,  procedures,  customs,  and/or  protocols, \n2  Defendants employed these raids without adequate notice to Plaintiffs. \n3  235.  During these raids, Defendants seized and destroyed Plaintiffsโ property and \n4  the property of individuals served by FFE and FFE members without affording them \n5  adequate notice their property would be seized or destroyed. \n6  236.  For Plaintiffs, individuals served by FFE, and FFE members, this property is \n7  what they rely on for survival. It is all they have. Compared with that extremely high interest \n8  in their property, any administrative burden on the City to provide additional process to \n9  prevent erroneous deprivation is low. \n10  237.  Plaintiffsโ property and the property of individuals served by FFE and FFE \n11  members was not seized in connection with prosecution or investigation of any crime. \n12  238.  Defendants destroyed Plaintiffsโ property and the property of individuals \n13  served by FFE and FFE members without affording them a post-deprivation process for \n14  challenging the seizure of their property. \n15  239.  It is clearly established Plaintiffs and individuals served by FFE and FFE \n16  members have a right to due process and post-deprivation hearings when their property is \n17  unlawfully seized and destroyed. \n18  240.  A  reasonable  official  in  Interim  Chief  Sullivanโs  and  Director  Milneโs \n19  position would have known that seizing and destroying property without due process of law \n20  violates the Fourteenth Amendment. \n21  241.  Defendantsโ unconstitutional acts were the direct and proximate cause of the \n22  seizure, destruction, and loss of Plaintiffsโ property and the property of individuals served \n23  by FFE and FFE members. \n24  242.  The  acts  of  Defendants  were  intentional  and  deprived  Plaintiffs  and \n25  individuals served by FFE and FFE members of their rights, privileges, liberties, and \n26  immunities secured by the Constitution of the United States. \n27  243.  Plaintiffs are entitled to damages in an amount to be determined by a jury. \n28 \n     \n- 31 - \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02041-GMS   Document 145   Filed 04/29/24   Page 32 of 42\n \n1  Count Three \n2  (Eighth AmendmentโCruel & Unusual Punishment) \n3  (42 U.S.C. ยง 1983) \n4  (All Defendants) \n5  244.  Plaintiffs re-allege the foregoing paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n6  245.  The  Eighth  Amendment  to  the  United  States  Constitution  prohibits  the \n7  government from inflicting cruel and unusual punishment. \n8  246.  The Eighth Amendment โnot only limits the types of punishment that may be \n9  imposed and prohibits the imposition of punishment grossly disproportionate to the severity \n10  of the crime, but also โimposes substantive limits on what can be made criminal and \n11  punished as such.โโ Martin v. City of Boise, 920 F.3d 584, 613 (9th Cir. 2019) (quoting \n12  Ingraham v. Wright, 430 U.S. 651, 667 (1977)). \n13  247.  The Ninth Circuit has made clear that statutes prohibiting sleeping outside \n14  implicate the protections of the Eighth Amendment when applied to homeless individuals. \n15  Martin, 920 F.3d at 615; see also Johnson v. City of Grants Pass, 72 F.4th 868 (9th Cir. \n16  2023), cert. granted, 144 S. Ct. 679 (2024). \n17  248.  Defendant City of Phoenix has enacted ordinances which directly target the \n18  act of sleeping by unsheltered individuals who otherwise have no place to sleep. \n19  249.  Phoenix City Code ยง 23-30(A) makes it unlawful for a person to camp within \n20  the City. \n21  250.  Phoenix City Code ยง 23-48.01 makes it unlawful for a person to lie, sit, or \n22  sleep in any public right of way or sidewalk, even if those places are otherwise unoccupied. \n23  251.   Phoenix  City  Code  ยง 23-85.01  and  A.R.S.  ยง 13-1501  et.  seq.  make  it \n24  unlawful for a person to remain on property.  \n25  252.  The  City  commonly  uses  the  Camping  Ban,  the  Sleeping  Ban,  and  the \n26  Trespassing Bans against Plaintiffs, FFE members, and individuals served by FFE to \n27  criminalize the act of being homeless and engaging in universal and unavoidable human \n28  activities such as sleeping. \n     \n- 32 - \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02041-GMS   Document 145   Filed 04/29/24   Page 33 of 42\n \n1  253.  Defendants  enforce  these  statutes  and  ordinances  pursuant  to  the  Cityโs \n2  policies, procedures, customs, and/or protocols. \n3  254.  Plaintiffs, individuals served by FFE, and FFE members have been cited \n4  under numerous statutes and ordinances by Defendants for the act of sleeping or simply \n5  existing in public space when they had nowhere else to go. \n6  255.  Defendants commonly cite individuals who are unsheltered, including those \n7  who practically cannot obtain adequate shelter, under these statutes and ordinances, as well \n8  as others, during their raids. \n9  256.  By criminalizing basic human activities such as sleeping, Defendants are \n10  knowingly  and  intentionally  violating  the  constitutional  rights  of  the  unsheltered \n11  community. \n12  257.  It  is  clearly  established  Plaintiffs,  individuals  served  by  FFE,  and  FFE \n13  members cannot constitutionally be punished for sleeping in public spaces when no indoor \n14  shelter or other appropriate, safe, and legal public place is practically available to them. \n15  258.  A reasonable official in Interim Chief Sullivanโs position would have known \n16  that enforcing these statutes and ordinances against the unsheltered population constituted \n17  a violation of their Eighth Amendment rights. \n18  259.  As  a  direct  and  proximate  cause  of  Defendantsโ  unconstitutional  acts, \n19  Plaintiffs, individuals served by FFE, and FFE members have been deprived of the basic \n20  human right to sleep. \n21  260.  The acts of Defendants were intentional and deprived Plaintiffs, individuals \n22  served by FFE, and FFE members of their rights, privileges, liberties, and immunities \n23  secured by the Constitution of the United States. \n24  Count Four \n25  (Eighth AmendmentโExcessive Fines) \n26  (All Defendants) \n27  261.  Plaintiffs re-allege the foregoing paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n28 \n     \n- 33 - \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02041-GMS   Document 145   Filed 04/29/24   Page 34 of 42\n \n1  262.  The  Eighth  Amendment  to  the  United  States  Constitution  prohibits  the \n2  imposition of excessive fines. \n3  263.  The  Excessive  Fines  Clause  โlimits  the  governmentโs  power  to  extract \n4  payments, whether in case or in kind, as a punishment for some offense.โ  Austin v. United \n5  States, 509 U.S. 602, 609-10 (1993). A fine violates the Eighth Amendment if it is โgrossly \n6  disproportional to the gravity of the defendantโs offense.โ United States v. Bajakajian, 524 \n7  U.S. 321, 336โ37 (1998).  \n8  264.  The  Excessive  Fines  Clause  applies  to  fines  assessed  by  municipalities. \n9  Pimental v. City of Los Angeles, 974 F.3d 917, 922 (9th Cir. 2020).  \n10  265.  To determine whether a fine is unconstitutionally excessive under the Eighth \n11  Amendment, courts are not required to consider rigid factors but commonly consider: โ(1) \n12  the nature and extent of the crime; (2) whether the violation was related to other illegal \n13  activities; (3) the other penalties that may be imposed for the violation; and (4) the extent \n14  of the harm caused.โ U.S. v. $100,348.00 in U.S. Currency, 354 F.3d 1110, 1121โ22 (9th \n15  Cir. 2004) (citing Bajakajian, 524 U.S. at 337โ40). None of these factors supports the fines \n16  imposed by the City against its unhoused population when they have nowhere else to go.  \n17  266.  Here, Defendant City of Phoenix has imposed fines on Plaintiffs, individuals \n18  served by FFE, and FFE members for violation of the Sleeping Ban, Camping Ban, and \n19  Trespassing Bans.   \n20  267.  The fines imposed on Plaintiffs, individuals served by FFE, and FFE members \n21  for such violations are grossly disproportional to the gravity of the offense.  \n22  268.  Sleeping is a basic human need, and Plaintiffs, individuals served by FFE, \n23  and FFE members lack culpability for sleeping in a public place when they have nowhere \n24  else to go.  \n25  269.  The City fines individuals, including Plaintiffs, individuals served by FFE, \n26  and FFE members even though sleeping on the street is not in furtherance of other illegal \n27  activities.  \n28  270.  Sleeping on the street causes negligible harm to the City.  \n     \n- 34 - \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02041-GMS   Document 145   Filed 04/29/24   Page 35 of 42\n \n1  271.  There is no government purpose for proscribing sleeping on the street when \n2  an individual has no other place to go.  \n3  272.  Plaintiffs, individuals served by FFE, and members of FFE are unable to \n4  afford the fines imposed on them for violation of the Sleeping Ban, Camping Ban, and \n5  Trespassing Bans.  \n6  273.  In light of the minor nature of the violations and their financial effects on \n7  Plaintiffs, individuals served by FFE, and FFE members, the aforementioned fines are \n8  punitive in nature and are grossly excessive and disproportional to the behavior for which \n9  Defendants are imposing these fines. The dollar amount and enforcement of these penalties \n10  constitutes a violation of the Eighth Amendmentโs Excessive Fines clause, as incorporated \n11  by the Fourteenth Amendment.   \n12  274.  It is clearly established that excessively fining Plaintiffs, individuals served \n13  by FFE, and FFE members for sleeping in public spaces  when  indoor shelter is not \n14  practically available to them is a violation of their constitutional rights. \n15  275.  A reasonable official in Interim Chief Sullivanโs position would have known \n16  that fining Plaintiffs, individuals served by FFE, and FFE members for sleeping in public \n17  spaces when indoor shelter is not practically available constituted a violation of their Eighth \n18  Amendment rights. \n19  276.  The acts of Defendants were intentional and violated the constitutional rights \n20  of Plaintiffs, individuals served by FFE, and FFE members to be free from excessive fines.  \n21  277.  Plaintiffs are entitled to damages in an amount to be determined by a jury. \n22  Count Five \n23  (Municipal Liability under Monell) \n24  (All Defendants) \n25  278.  Plaintiffs re-allege the foregoing paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n26  279.  Defendants were at all times relevant agents of the City vested with the power \n27  to control and supervise employees, agents, and contractors of the City. \n28 \n     \n- 35 - \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02041-GMS   Document 145   Filed 04/29/24   Page 36 of 42\n \n1  280.  Upon information and belief, Defendants acted in execution of government \n2  policy or custom that may fairly be said to represent the official policy of the City. See \n3  Monell v. Depโt of Soc. Servs. of N.Y., 436 U.S. 658, 694 (1978). \n4  281.  Defendantsโ actions were authorized (before and during the fact) and ratified \n5  (after the fact) by final policymakers for the City. \n6  282.  Defendants directed every action of their agents, thereby causing the violation \n7  of Plaintiffsโ rights, the rights of individuals served by FFE, and FFE membersโ rights, and \n8  were deliberately indifferent to the fact that their directives would result in the violation of \n9  such rights. \n10  283.  Defendantsโ customs, policies, and/or practices, and the decisions of its final \n11  policymakers  were  the  moving  force  behind  Defendantsโ  violation  of  Plaintiffsโ \n12  constitutional rights, the constitutional rights of  individuals served by FFE, and FFE \n13  membersโ constitutional rights. \n14  284.  Defendantsโ actions, as described herein, were motivated by malice and/or \n15  involved reckless or callous indifference to Plaintiffsโ federally protected constitutional \n16  rights, the federally protected constitutional rights of individuals served by FFEโs, and FFE \n17  membersโ federally protected constitutional rights. Defendants engaged in these actions and \n18  omissions intentionally, willfully, and/or wantonly, demonstrating deliberate indifference \n19  to, and a reckless disregard for, such constitutionally protected rights. \n20  285.  Defendants  have  or  should  have  policies,  procedures,  practices,  and/or \n21  customs to govern the raids to prevent the deprivations that occurred. Defendants have \n22  instead used or employed policies, procedures, practices, and/or customs that penalize \n23  unsheltered individuals for their status and destroy the property of Plaintiffs, individuals \n24  served by FFE, and FFE members. \n25  286.  Defendant City of Phoenix and the PPDโs policies, procedures, practices, \n26  and/or customs should require agents or employees of the City to refrain from destroying \n27  unsheltered Plaintiffsโ possessions during such raids. \n28 \n     \n- 36 - \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02041-GMS   Document 145   Filed 04/29/24   Page 37 of 42\n \n1  287.  Defendants failed to train or supervise their employees when conducting raids \n2  of unsheltered populations such as Plaintiffs, individuals served by FFE, and FFE members, \n3  resulting in the criminalization of their unsheltered status and destruction of their property.  \n4  288.  As a direct and proximate result of Defendantsโ acts or omissions pursuant to \n5  official government policy, practice, or custom, Plaintiffs, individuals served by FFE, and \n6  FFE members suffered (without limitation) a deprivation of constitutional rights. \n7  289.  Plaintiffs are entitled to damages in an amount to be determined by a jury.  \n8  Count Six \n9  (Fourteenth AmendmentโState Created Danger) \n10  (All Defendants) \n11  290.  Plaintiffs re-allege the foregoing paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n12  291.  The due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States \n13  Constitution prevents Defendants from placing Plaintiffs, individuals served by FFE, and \n14  FFE members in danger by acting with deliberate indifference to a known and obvious \n15  danger. \n16  292.  During the summer, temperatures in Phoenix can reach as high as 119 degrees \n17  Fahrenheit. \n18  293.  Without access to shade, temperatures can be even hotter. \n19  294.  Hundreds of unsheltered individuals die from heat related exposure every \n20  summer in Phoenix.  \n21  295.  Each year, Maricopa County puts out a report on heat-related deaths. The City \n22  of Phoenix contributes to the report.34   \n23  296.  Defendants  know  that  unsheltered  individuals,  including  Plaintiffs, \n24  individuals served by FFE, and FFE members, are at high risk for heat related illness and \n25  death. \n26 \n27   \n34  2023  Heat  Related  Deaths  Report,  Maricopa  Cnty., \n28 \nhttps://www.maricopa.gov/ArchiveCenter/ViewFile/Item/5796 (last updated April 2024).  \n     \n- 37 - \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02041-GMS   Document 145   Filed 04/29/24   Page 38 of 42\n \n1  297.  Defendants know that removing unsheltered individuals from shaded areas \n2  and destroying items that provide them with protection from the sun, including tents and \n3  tarps, increase those individualsโ exposure to the sun and their risk of heat-related illness \n4  and death. \n5  298.  Defendants make Plaintiffs, individuals served by FFE, and FFE members \n6  move from shaded areas protected from the sun under threat of arrest and citation during \n7  extremely  hot  temperatures,  despite  knowing  that  being  forced  to  gather  and  their \n8  belongings under these circumstances and leave shaded areas is dangerous to their health.  \n9  299.  Defendants confiscate and destroy tents, tarps, and other shade-providing \n10  structures used by Plaintiffs, individuals served by FFE, and FFE members to protect \n11  themselves from the sun during extremely hot temperatures, despite knowing that depriving \n12  these individuals of shade-providing structures under these circumstances is dangerous to \n13  their health.  \n14  300.  As a direct and proximate result of Defendantsโ actions, Plaintiffs, individuals \n15  served by FFE, and FFE members have been subjected to a heightened risk of heat-related \n16  illness or death that severely threatens their bodily security. \n17  301.  As a direct and proximate result of Defendantsโ actions, Plaintiffs have \n18  suffered a deprivation of their constitutional rights. \n19  PRAYER FOR RELIEF \n20  WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs pray for judgment against Defendants as follows: \n21  A.

Phoenix is one of the epicenters of the homelessness crisis gripping the United \n11 \nStates. Since 2010, the number of people experiencing homelessness in the city of Phoenix \n12 \nhas more than doubled, and the crisis shows no sign of abating.1  The number of people \n13 \nexperiencing chronic homelessness in Maricopa County (the โCountyโ) increased by 103% \n14 \nfrom 2017 to 2023.2 Meanwhile, instead of taking responsibility for its role in creating this \n15 \ncrisis, Defendant City of Phoenix (the โCityโ) has continued to exacerbate the problem by \n16 \npunishing its thousands of unhoused residents.3   \n17 \n18 \n \n19 \n1  Compare  Maricopa  Assโn  of  Govโts,  2010  Homeless  Street  Count, \n20  https://www.azmag.gov/Portals/0/Documents/MagContent/2010%20Point%20in%20Time\n%20Count%20for%20AZ-502%20(Municipal%20Street%20Count).pdf?ver=2017-07-07-\n21 \n134153-897 (recording approximately 1,750 unhoused individuals) with Maricopa Assโn of \nGovโts,  2023  Point-in-Time  (PIT)  Count  Report  4, \n22 \nhttps://azmag.gov/Portals/0/Homelessness/PIT-Count/2023/2023-PIT-Count-Report-\n23  Final.pdf?ver=8CRzv7xw28C-V2G0sMdKfw%3D%3D (recording over 3,333 unhoused \nindividuals). \n24 \n2 2023 Point-in-Time (PIT) Count Report, supra note 1 at 3. \n25 \n3  Throughout  this  complaint  the  terms  โunhoused,โ  โhomeless,โ  and  โexperiencing \n26  homelessnessโ denote individuals who meet the federal law definition of homelessness. See \n42  U.S.C.  ยง 11302;  24  C.F.R.  ยง  582.5.  The  use  of  the  term  โunshelteredโ  refers  to \n27 \nindividuals who are experiencing homelessness and reside in a place that it not intended for \n28  human habitation (e.g., streets, cars, etc.).  \n   \n- 2 - \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02041-GMS   Document 159   Filed 07/12/24   Page 3 of 43\n \n1  2.  Every year, a growing number of Phoenix residents find themselves unable to \n2  afford a home. This is largely due to skyrocketing housing costs. From 2017 to 2023, the \n3  median rent in Phoenix increased by 54%.4 Because Phoenix does not have sufficient \n4  shelter, many of those who find themselves unhoused have no choice but to take to the cityโs \n5  streets and other public areas. Indeed, in 2023, over half of Maricopa Countyโs unhoused \n6  population was unsheltered.5  \n7  3.  From the elements alone, these individuals face brutal conditions. In the \n8  summer, for example, temperatures average over 100 degrees Fahrenheit and can soar up \n9  to 119 degrees.6 Between June 30 and July 30 of 2023, Phoenix experienced a record-\n10  breaking 31 consecutive days over 110 degrees Fahrenheit.7 The summer sun bakes the \n11  asphalt, concrete, and other surfaces that make up the cityโs public areas, making scarce any \n12  places of refuge. As a result, hundreds of unsheltered individuals, who are at high risk of \n13  exposure to the elements because they have nowhere else to go, die each year from heat-\n14  related illnesses.8 In 2023, unsheltered individuals โaccounted for over half of the Cityโs \n15  record-breaking number of heat-related deaths.โ9 \n16 \n17 \n \n18 \n4 Alex Horowitz and Tushar Kansal, Restrictive Zoning is Raising Housing Costs and \nHomelessness  in  Arizona,  Pew  Charitable  Trusts    (Dec.  7,  2023),  \n19 \nhttps://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/articles/2023/12/07/restrictive-\n20  zoning-is-raising-housing-costs-and-homelessness-in-arizona. \n21  5  Point-In-Time  Homelessness  Count,  Maricopa  Assโn  of  Govโts.,  \nhttps://azmag.gov/Programs/Homelessness/Data/Point-In-Time-Homelessness-Count (last \n22 \nvisited April 28, 2024).  \n23  6 Phoenix Hit 110 Degrees on 54 Days in 2023, Setting Another Heat Record, PBS News \nHour (Sept. 10, 2023, 10:57 a.m.), https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/phoenix-hit-110-\n24 \ndegrees-on-54-days-in-2023-setting-another-heat-record. \n25 \n7 See Jack Healy, Phoenixโs Month in Hell: A 31-Day Streak of Record Heat Ends, N.Y. \nTimes (July 31, 2023), https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/31/us/phoenix-heat-july.html. \n26 \n8 Phoenix Hit 110 Degrees on 54 Days in 2023, supra note 6.  \n27 \n9  U.S.  Depโt  of  Just.,  Investigation  of  the  City  of  Phoenix  and  the  Phoenix  Police \n28 \nDepartment 43, n.38 (2024), https://www.justice.gov/crt/media/1355866/dl?inline. \n   \n- 3 - \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02041-GMS   Document 159   Filed 07/12/24   Page 4 of 43\n \n1  4.  As if these conditions alone were not bad enough, unhoused individuals who \n2  involuntarily sleep in Phoenixโs public areas also face harassment and mistreatment by the \n3  City, in violation of their constitutional rights. People who do nothing more than lie down \n4  on the Cityโs streets because they have nowhere else to rest their heads are threatened, \n5  detained, fined, and arrested for violating city ordinances or state law. \n6  5.   The City also takes or destroys the few personal effects these unhoused \n7  individuals have, leaving no opportunity to retrieve those effects.  \n8  6.  The City created the Office of Homeless Solutions (โOHSโ) in 2022. OHS \n9  was originally intended to create transparency about the cityโs homelessness crisis. OHS \n10  was also tasked with creating and implementing a storage policy and system for items taken \n11  by the City from those who are unhoused, but has failed to adhere to the announced \n12  procedure. Instead, OHS has worked hand-in-hand with the Phoenix Police Department \n13  (โPPDโ) to ratify and systematically conduct โclean sweeps,โ which are raids that target \n14  people experiencing homelessness and violate their constitutional rights.10  \n15  7.  The City conducts raids of homeless encampments without cause or suspicion \n16  despite knowing  that  these individuals  have  nowhere else to go,  given the  dearth of \n17  affordable housing and emergency shelter space.11 \n18  8.  The City and its agents also indiscriminately and irretrievably seize, impound, \n19  and destroy unsheltered individualsโ personal property and survival gear without notice, \n20  cause, or a warrant. \n21  9.  During these raids, unsheltered individuals, including Plaintiffs and members \n22  of  Plaintiff  Fund  for  Empowerment  (โFFEโ)  have  lost  clothing,  survival  equipment, \n23 \n \n24  10  At  various  times,  the  City  has  used  other  terms,  including  โenhanced  cleanups,โ \nโencampment cleanups,โ and โenhanced engagements,โ to describe this policy, custom, or \n25 \npractice. \n26  11 See Madeline Ackley, Phoenix Still Criminalizes Homelessness, Despite Court Ruling, \nProtesters  Say,  AZ  Mirror,  (Jan.  9,  2020,  9:13  a.m.), \n27 \nhttps://www.azmirror.com/2020/01/09/phoenix-still-criminalizes-homelessness-despite-\n28  court-ruling-protesters-say/. \n   \n- 4 - \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02041-GMS   Document 159   Filed 07/12/24   Page 5 of 43\n \n1  medication, items of sentimental value (like photographs of loved ones), and, perhaps most \n2  inexplicably, vital records and identifying documentsโlike birth certificates and reference \n3  lettersโwhich are crucial to procuring jobs, benefits, and housing. These documents can \n4  be almost impossible for someone with no fixed address to replace.12 \n5  10.  The Cityโs raids also place unsheltered individuals, including Plaintiffs and \n6  members of Plaintiff FFE, at greater risk of heat-related illness and death. Even when \n7  temperatures exceed 90 degrees, the City often provides mere minutes for people to gather \n8  their belongings and flee the area. The stress and physical exertion this causes can prove \n9  dangerous in such high temperatures, especially for elderly and disabled individuals. The \n10  raids also often target individuals in shaded areas, forcing them out of relatively cool areas \n11  to wander through the City in the direct sun. And the Cityโs destruction of survival \n12  equipment, like tents or tarps that provide some protection from the sun, also increases \n13  unhoused individualsโ exposure to dangerous temperatures.  \n14  11.  All told, instead of confronting its housing crisis head-on and investing in \n15  sustainable solutions to homelessness, the City is terrorizing the very people it should be \n16  helping.  In fact, in a report issued on June 13, 2024, the United States Department of Justice \n17  concluded that there is \n18  reasonable  cause  to  believe  that  [the  Phoenix  Police \n19  Department]  violates  the  rights  of  people  experiencing \n20  homelessness . . .[insofar as the Phoenix Police Department] \n21  stops, detains, and arrests people who are homeless without \n22  reasonable  suspicion  that  they  are  engaged  in  criminal \n23  activity[,] . . .

The City has weaponized โclean sweepsโ to drive unhoused people from \n6  Phoenix by making the cityโs public areas unlivable. The City has made its message to \n7  unhoused individuals clear:  engaging in sleep and other essential life activities on the cityโs \n8  public grounds will lead to detention, arrest, displacement, and the loss of the individualโs \n9  personal effects. \n10  13.  The Cityโs actions are unconstitutional, especially in light of the fact that \n11  many  of  the  affected  individuals,  including  Plaintiff  FFEโs  members  and  individual \n12  Plaintiffs here, have no choice but to live in the cityโs public areas, as the City has fallen \n13  well short of its responsibility to provide adequate shelter to meet the needs of its unhoused \n14  population.14 \n15  JURISDICTION & VENUE \n16  14.

Plaintiff Fund for Empowerment (โFFEโ) is an incorporated nonprofit charity \n6  operating in the County that commonly expends time, energy, effort, and resources on \n7  behalf of the unsheltered population. FFEโs mission is to build community resources for the \n8  unsheltered population via direct services, capacity-building training, and project support. \n9  FFE  helps  protect  and  advocate  for  the  dignity,  rights,  and  choices  of  Arizonans \n10  experiencing homelessness or housing insecurity. FFE commits its efforts toward goals \n11  affirmed and raised by unsheltered individuals. FFEโs members include both the currently \n12  and formerly unhoused, including specifically people who are involuntarily unhoused, as \n13  well as allies looking to support unhoused people who lack shelter. FFE emphasizes the \n14  voices of the unsheltered to expose root causes of homelessness and to create ways of living \n15  in which everyone has a safe place they can call home. \n16  19.  Plaintiff Ronnie Massingille is currently involuntarily unhoused and lives in \n17  Phoenix, Arizona. Mr. Massingille cannot practically obtain shelter, much less a fixed, \n18  regular, and adequate nighttime residence. Although Mr. Massingille is sometimes able to \n19  obtain a shelter bed at St. Vincent de Paul, on most nights, he must sleep on the street.

Plaintiff Faith Kearns is a chronically unsheltered individual who resides in \n5  Maricopa County, Arizona. Ms. Kearns has directly experienced the raids performed by the \n6  City and PPD, which have resulted in the destruction of her personal property. \n7  23.  Plaintiff Frank Urban has been chronically unsheltered off and on since 2000 \n8  in Maricopa County, Arizona. Mr. Urban has received criminal citations from PPD for \n9  trespassing, obstructing a thoroughfare, and simply standing on the sidewalk in connection \n10  to his unsheltered status. Mr. Urban has directly experienced the raids performed by the \n11  City and PPD, which have resulted in the destruction of his personal property. \n12  24.  Plaintiff Timothy James is currently involuntarily unhoused and lives in \n13  Phoenix, Arizona. Mr. James cannot practically obtain shelter, much less a fixed, regular, \n14  and adequate nighttime residence.

The number of residents experiencing homelessness in Phoenix has more than \n21  doubled  since  2010  according  to  Point-in-Time  (โPITโ)  counts  commissioned  by  the \n22  Maricopa Association of Governments.15   \n23  34.  This increase directly relates to the Cityโs lack of affordable housing for \n24  residents that was exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic.16 \n25   \n15 See 2010 Homeless Street Count, supra note 1.  \n26 \n16 Median home prices in the Phoenix metro area have risen over 216% since 2000, while \n27  the median income has grown only 48%. It is estimated that by 2025 only a third of the \nareaโs population will be able to afford a home. Belinda Luscombe, Why Phoenixโof All \n28 \nPlacesโHas the Fastest Growing Home Prices in the U.S., TIME Business (May 3, 2022, \n   \n- 9 - \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02041-GMS   Document 159   Filed 07/12/24   Page 10 of 43\n \n1  35.  Sustainable solutions to this spike in homelessness, including affordable \n2  housing, have lagged far behind, in large part because of the Cityโs inaction. For example, \n3  when this lawsuit was filed in November 2022, the City had spent less than 10% of the \n4  $99.5 million it received from the federal government through the American Rescue Plan \n5  Act (โARPAโ) in order to address homelessness and affordable housing.17 The City still has \n6  not spent more than half of the ARPA funds it budgeted for these purposes.18 \n7  36.  Without an adequate supply of affordable housing, Phoenix residents can \n8  easily  become unsheltered after  disruptions  in  household income  caused by job loss, \n9  medical bankruptcy, emergency, mental illness, divorce, or domestic violence. \n10  37.  Black, Indigenous, and other people of color are disproportionately affected \n11  by  the  homelessness  crisis.  In  Maricopa  County,  Black  people  make  up  28%  of  the \n12  unhoused population, but only 6% of the general population. The Indigenous proportion of \n13  the  homeless  population  in  the  County  is  more  than  twice  its  share  of  the  general \n14  population.19 \n15  38.  Notwithstanding  the  fact  that  shelters  are  only  a  temporary  solution  to \n16  homelessness, the Cityโs efforts to supply temporary shelter fall far short of the need. \n17  According to the January 2022 Point-in-Time count, which considerably undercounts the \n18  unsheltered population, 2,942 people in Phoenix were temporarily housed in an emergency \n19  shelter  or  transitional  housing  while  3,096  people  in  Phoenix  remained  completely \n20 \n21   \n1:30 p.m.), https://time.com/6170497/phoenix-fastest-growing-home-prices/. This increase \n22 \nhas also caused a corresponding increase in rental prices.

From 2020 to 2022, the unsheltered subset of the homeless population in the \n5  County, which includes Phoenix, grew by 34%. This means that the total number of \n6  unsheltered people in the County surpasses the number of this population in shelters (5,029 \n7  to 3,997).22 \n8  40.

For its part, Phoenix only had 1,492 shelter beds available at the end of \n2  2021.27 According to the City, in 2022 and 2023, Phoenix added 1,072 shelter beds,28 which \n3  means that the city had, at most, 2,564 beds by the end of 2023โstill not nearly enough to \n4  provide shelter to the nearly 7,000 unhoused residents identified in the 2023 Point-in-Time \n5  count.29 \n6  42.  Despite  the  already  inadequate  number  of  shelter  beds  available,  OHS \n7  announced that it closed the โTemporary Haven,โ operated by Central Arizona Shelter \n8  Services (โCASSโ), which โserved 73 unique individuals,โ and also reported that โ[o]ther \n9  temporary lodging sites are slated for closure in the next few months and into fall 2024.โ30 \n10  43.  Many shelters are also inaccessible to people with certain disabilities or \n11  limited to individuals that meet certain eligibility requirements, and thus are not available \n12  to everyone experiencing homelessness in Phoenix. This leaves many with no alternative to \n13  existing and sleeping in public, as the shelters without such criteria have limited space with \n14  rare availability.  \n15  44.  Moreover, while emergency shelters can temporarily accommodate some \n16  people experiencing homelessness, they are not an adequate response to Phoenixโs rapid \n17  increase in unsheltered residents. For example, providing someone who is involuntarily \n18  unhoused with a shelter bed or motel room for one night does not resolve their status as \n19 \n20   \n27 City of Phoenix, Strategies to Address Homelessness: Task Force Recommendations to \n21 \nthe  City  Manager  14  (2022),  https://www.phoenix.gov/humanservicessite/Documents/ \nTask%20Force%20Recommendations%20to%20the%20City%20Manager-Final.pdf. \n22 \n28 Office of Homeless Solutions, City of Phx., https://www.phoenix.gov/solutions (last \n23 \nvisited Apr. 28, 2024).  \n24 \n29 The 2023 Point-in-Time Report identified 3,569 people in Phoenix who were temporarily \nhoused in an emergency shelter or transitional housing and 3,333 individuals who were \n25 \ncompletely unsheltered. 2023 Point-in-Time (PIT) Count Report, supra note 1 at 4-5. \n26 \n30  See  City  of  Phoenix,  Office  of  Homeless  Solutions  Program  Report,  in  General \n27  Information  Packet  3,  4  (Apr.  18,  2024), \nhttps://www.phoenix.gov/cityclerksite/City%20Council%20Meeting%20Files/4-18-\n28 \n24%20General%20Info%20Packet-FINAL.pdf.  \n   \n- 12 - \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02041-GMS   Document 159   Filed 07/12/24   Page 13 of 43\n \n1  involuntarily  unhoused.  Research  shows  that  the  most  effective  way  to  end  chronic \n2  homelessness is to provide permanent supportive housing on a housing-first basis.31 \n3  45.  Without  access  to  shelter  or  affordable  housing,  many  experiencing \n4  homelessness in Phoenix, including the Plaintiffs, those served by FFE, and members of \n5  FFE, have nowhere else to go. They are involuntarily unhoused. \n6  The Cityโs Raids \n7  46.  For at least the past three years, the City has had a policy, custom, or practice \n8  of systematically conducting raids it calls โclean sweepsโ of areas occupied by unsheltered \n9  individuals and those experiencing homelessness.32 \n10  47.  During these raids, it is a City policy, custom, or practice to rouse unsheltered \n11  individuals (including Plaintiffs, those served by FFE, and FFE members) in the early \n12  morning hours and order them to pack up their blankets, tents, and all their personal \n13  belongings. \n14  48.  Plaintiffs, FFEโs members, and other individuals who are served by FFE are \n15  not provided notification of when these raids will occur. \n16  49.  Some of these raids occur as early as 3:00 AM. \n17  50.  The City directs the PPD, Environmental Services, and other City agencies \n18  and contractors, acting as โclean-upโ crews, to remove property. \n19  51.  Unsheltered individuals (including Plaintiffs, those served by FFE, and FFE \n20  members) typically have just minutes to gather their personal possessions and belongings \n21  before the raid begins. Because mere minutes are not enough time to gather and relocate \n22  possessions (particularly for people with disabilities), the inevitable result of the Cityโs raids \n23  is that people permanently lose any property they cannot immediately carry away with \n24  them.  \n25   \n31 See, e.g., U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness, ALL IN: The Federal Strategic \n26  Plan  to  Prevent  and  End  Homelessness  42  (Dec.  2022), \nhttps://www.usich.gov/sites/default/files/document/All_In.pdf. \n27 \n32 See Investigation of the City of Phoenix and the Phoenix Police Department, supra note \n28 \n9, at 47-51. \n   \n- 13 - \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02041-GMS   Document 159   Filed 07/12/24   Page 14 of 43\n \n1  52.  The  PPD,  City  workers,  and/or  โclean-upโ  crews  begin  indiscriminately \n2  removing and destroying any items that individuals have been unable to gather and move \n3  in the short time allowed. \n4  53.  Removal is performed with rakes, garbage bags, loaders, and sometimes a \n5  disposal truck. \n6  54.  These raids commonly result in the loss and destruction of personal property \n7  owned by those experiencing homelessness. Some of these items are necessary for survival, \n8  including tents, shades for heat relief, sleeping bags, medication, and blankets. \n9  55.  Because of these raids, individuals (including Plaintiffs, those served by FFE, \n10  and FFE members) frequently experience destruction of items difficult to replace such as \n11  personal IDs, photographs of family members and loved ones, and, in one case, even a set \n12  of teeth. \n13  56.  Upon information and belief, the purpose of these raids is to discourage \n14  individuals experiencing homelessness from sleeping in the City and to push them to other \n15  surrounding municipalities surrounding Phoenix in the County. \n16  57.  Upon information and belief, the Cityโs policy is to use these raids to address \n17  the rise in those experiencing homelessness to divert criticism for failing to adequately \n18  provide both emergency and permanent housing. \n19  The Cityโs Weaponization of Statutes and Ordinances Against Unsheltered People \n20  58.  During the Cityโs raids, which are conducted in accordance with the City and \n21  PPDโs policies, practices, and customs, police officers often issue criminal citations under \n22  the Arizona Revised Statutes and City Ordinances.33 \n23  59.  The City has cited individuals for violations of Phoenix City Code ยง 23-30 \n24  (the โCamping Banโ), Phoenix City Code ยง 23-48.01 (the โSleeping Banโ), Phoenix City \n25  Code ยง 23-85.01 and Arizona Revised Statutes ยง 13-1501 et seq.

The Camping Ban provides: โIt shall be unlawful for any person to camp in \n2  any park or preserve, or in any building, facility, or parking lot or structure, or on any \n3  property adjacent thereto, that is owned, possessed and controlled by the City . . . .โ Phx., \n4  Ariz., City Code ยง 23-30(A). \n5  61.  On May 29, 2024, the City further expanded the Camping Ban to prohibit \n6  camping within 500 feet of schools, child care facilities, shelters, or city parks.34 \n7  62.  According to the City, camping means โto use real property of the City for \n8  living accommodation purposes such as sleeping activities, or making preparations to sleep, \n9  including the laying down of bedding for the purpose of sleeping, or storing personal \n10  belongings, or making any fire, or using any tents or shelter or other structure or vehicle for \n11  sleeping or doing any digging or earth breaking or carrying on cooking activities.โ Id. ยง 23-\n12  30(B). \n13  63.  As indicated in the Cityโs definition of the term โcamp,โ the Camping Ban \n14  punishes and criminalizes the act of sleeping by unsheltered individuals within the City. \n15  64.  The  Camping  Ban  is  commonly  cited  by  the  City  against  unsheltered \n16  individuals during raids to discourage basic human activities such as sleeping. \n17  65.  The Sleeping Ban provides: โIt shall be unlawful for any person to use a \n18  public street, highway, alley, lane, parkway, sidewalk or other right-of-way, whether such \n19  right-of-way has been dedicated to the public in fee or by easement, for lying, sleeping or \n20  otherwise remaining in a sitting position thereon, except in the case of a physical emergency \n21  or the administration of medical assistance.โ Id. ยง 23-48.01. \n22  66.  The Sleeping Ban is broad and prohibits sleeping on areas of City property \n23  otherwise unused by pedestrians. \n24 \n25 \n \n26 \n34 See Phx., Ariz., City Code ยง 23-30, amended by Ordinance G-XXX (effective Sept. 1, \n27  2024).  In the interim, a copy of the pending amendment can be found at: \nhttps://phoenix.legistar.com/View.ashx?M=F&ID=12976672&GUID=D6837534-E389-\n28 \n45F4-B9E5-584C69E69A5D.  \n   \n- 15 - \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02041-GMS   Document 159   Filed 07/12/24   Page 16 of 43\n \n1  67.  The  Sleeping  Ban  is  commonly  cited  by  the  City  against  unsheltered \n2  individuals during raids to discourage universal and unavoidable human activities such as \n3  sleeping. \n4  68.  The Trespassing Bans prohibit:  \n5  a)  Entering or remaining unlawfully on any real property after a reasonable \nrequest to leave by the owner or any other person having lawful control \n6 \nover such property, or reasonable notice prohibiting entry.  \n7 \nb)  Entering or remaining unlawfully in the right-of-way for tracks, or the \n8  storage or switching yards or rolling stock of a railroad company.  \n9  c)  Entering or remaining unlawfully on any residential structure or fenced \ncommercial yard.  \n10 \nd)  Entering or remaining unlawfully in a residential structure or fenced \n11 \nresidential yard.  \n12 \ne)  Entering any residential yard without lawful authority, looking into the \n13  residential structure thereon with the intent to infringe on the inhabitantโs \nright of privacy.  \n14 \nId. ยง 23-85.01; see also A.R.S. ยง 13-1502 (prohibiting โ[k]nowingly entering or remaining \n15 \nunlawfully on any real property after a reasonable request to leave by a law enforcement \n16 \nofficer,  the  owner  or  any  other  person  having  lawful  control  over  such  property,  or \n17 \nreasonable notice prohibiting entryโ); id. ยง 13-1503 (prohibiting โknowingly entering or \n18 \nremaining unlawfully in or on any nonresidential structure or in any fenced commercial \n19 \nyardโ); id. ยง 13-1504 (prohibiting, inter alia, โentering or remaining unlawfully on a \n20 \nresidential structureโ or on a โresidential yardโ).   \n21 \n69.  The City has enforced the Trespassing Bans against unhoused individuals, \n22 \nincluding Plaintiffs, members of FFE, and those served by FFE, for merely standing, sitting, \n23 \nlying, or sleeping in public spaces.  \n24 \n70.  These statutes and ordinances apply city-wide, meaning that there is no place \n25 \nin the City where unsheltered individuals can sleep or simply exist without breaking the \n26 \nlaw. \n27 \n28 \n   \n- 16 - \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02041-GMS   Document 159   Filed 07/12/24   Page 17 of 43\n \n1  71.  Violation of these ordinances is a Class 1 misdemeanor, punishable by a fine \n2  up to $2,500 per violation and imprisonment of up to six months.  See Phx. Ariz. City Code \n3  ยง 1-5.35  \n4  72.  If an individual is unable to pay the fines imposed under these ordinances, or \n5  successfully contest them, they can face significant collateral consequences, including \n6  arrest warrants and permanent criminal records. 36  \n7  73.  For each criminal charge issued by the City generally and against these \n8  individuals specifically, in addition to the fines imposed by the ordinances themselves, a \n9  criminal fine is imposed  by the City against the charged party as a routine matter of course, \n10  and payment of the fine is generally required to resolve the criminal matter and to render \n11  the defendant eligible to have their conviction sealed or set-aside under Arizona law. \n12  74.  Absent the ability to pay the fine and have the charge sealed, a person will \n13  continue to have a criminal conviction record, which is often a material barrier to obtaining \n14  housing and employment. \n15  75.  The City is imposing fines on individuals, including Plaintiffs, individuals \n16  served by FFE, and FFE members, for violating these statutes and ordinances even though \n17  they lack culpability because they have nowhere else to sit, lie, or sleep. \n18  76.  These fines serve no remedial purpose and, upon information and belief, are \n19  imposed to deter unhoused individuals from residing in Phoenix.   \n20  77.  Despite this Courtโs preliminary injunction (ECF No. 119) prohibiting the \n21  City from enforcing the Camping and Sleeping Bans against โhomeless persons for sleeping \n22  in public if there are no other public areas or appropriate shelters where those individuals \n23 \n \n24  35 Violation of the Arizona Trespassing Ban is a Class 3 Misdemeanor punishable by a fine \nup to $500 or imprisonment up to 30 days. See A.R.S. ยง 13-802(C); A.R.S. ยง 13-707(A)(3).  \n25 \n36 See Investigation of the City of Phoenix and the Phoenix Police Department, supra note \n26  9, at 49 (โCitationsโoften given in lieu of arrestโrequire a person to appear in court. If \nthe person does not do so, the court issues a warrant for failure to appear, which leads to \n27 \narrests and time in jail. City officials and people experiencing homelessness told us that \n28  getting to court is challenging and bench warrants are commonplace for these citations.โ).  \n   \n- 17 - \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02041-GMS   Document 159   Filed 07/12/24   Page 18 of 43\n \n1  can sleep,โ (ECF No. 119 at 3) the City has nevertheless continued to enforce those \n2  prohibitions against individuals who are involuntarily unhoused and practically cannot \n3  obtain shelter and who do not have access to any public place or appropriate shelter where \n4  they can safely or legally sleep or simply exist.  \n5  78.  The City has also circumvented the preliminary injunction by enforcing the \n6  Trespassing Bans against involuntarily unhoused individuals who practically cannot obtain \n7  shelter or access to any public place where they can sleep or carry out essential life activities \n8  without risking violation of the Camping, Sleeping, or Trespassing Bans (or any other City \n9  ordinances), for acts of so-called โtrespassโ that amount to little more than sleeping or living \n10  on public property.37  \n11  79.  Despite  neighboring  municipalities  amending  their  policies  and  halting \n12  enforcement of similar ordinances, the City has continued its policy, practice, or custom of \n13  enforcing its ordinances and fining individuals even when housing and temporary shelter \n14  are not practically available to its unhoused residents.  \n15  80.  The City of Phoenix, by contrast, has not amended its Camping Ban, Sleeping \n16  Ban, or its Trespassing Ban and continues to pursue its policy, practice, or custom of \n17  enforcing these laws and imposing fines against involuntarily unhoused individuals who \n18  practically cannot obtain shelter and who do not have access to any public place they can \n19  legally sleep, lie, stand, or sit in public, even though this Court has imposed an injunction \n20  prohibiting the City from doing so.38 \n21 \n \n22  37 See Investigation of the City of Phoenix and the Phoenix Police Department, supra note \n9, at 47โ51.  \n23 \n \n38 Indeed, rather that turn away from criminalization as a โsolutionโ to its homelessness \n24 \ncrisis, the City has doubled down, introducing a new camping ban ordinance. See Collen \n25  Sikora, Proposed Change to Phoenixโs Camping Ordinance Would Ban Camping Within \n500  Feet  of  Certain  Places,  12  News  (Apr.  3,  2024,  6:40  p.m.), \n26 \nhttps://www.12news.com/article/news/local/valley/proposed-camping-ban-near-phoenix-\n27  schools-child-care-centers-shelters/75-a8a8234d-b8a3-4062-b2c3-3ceb2e3f9704. \nMembers of FFE expended time and resources advocating against this proposal at City \n28 \nCouncil hearings.  \n   \n- 18 - \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02041-GMS   Document 159   Filed 07/12/24   Page 19 of 43\n \n1  81.  Upon information and belief, the City has a policy, practice, or custom of \n2  issuing  citations  to  individuals  for  violations  of  these  (and  other)  statutes/codes  and \n3  imposing fines to discourage individuals experiencing homelessness from sleeping in the \n4  City and to push them to other surrounding municipalities in the County. \n5  82.  Upon information and belief, the City has a policy, practice, or custom of \n6  using  these  statutes  and  ordinances  in  place  of  finding  humane  solutions  for  those \n7  experiencing homelessness within the City. \n8  Plaintiff Fund for Empowermentโs Work on Behalf of the Unsheltered Community \n9  83.  Since 2018, the Fund for Empowerment has spent monetary resources in \n10  support of its mission to help provide education, training, and leadership courses to the \n11  unsheltered community to combat policies and practices by the City which target them. \n12  84.  FFE  has  approximately  200  members,  many  of  whom  are  currently \n13  involuntarily unhoused or chronically at risk of becoming unsheltered.  \n14  85.  FFE commonly creates and prints written materials for dissemination to the \n15  unsheltered community which include information about their rights under the United States \n16  Constitution. \n17  86.  FFE provides training to the unsheltered community about their rights in \n18  response to the raids conducted by the City. \n19  87.  FFE conducts bi-weekly sessions for the purpose of encouraging unsheltered \n20  people to advocate for themselves. Dozens of unsheltered people living in Phoenix attend \n21  these meetings. \n22  88.  Due to the Cityโs raids, a substantial portion of these meetings has been \n23  dedicated to identifying resources for unsheltered people impacted by the raids. \n24  89.  FFE provides training to the unsheltered community about their right to sleep \n25  outside in connection to the Cityโs use of statutes and ordinances to criminalize sleeping. \n26  90.  Since 2020, FFE has had to divert its resources to providing replacement \n27  safety items, such as tents and water, to individuals whose property was seized by the City \n28 \n   \n- 19 - \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02041-GMS   Document 159   Filed 07/12/24   Page 20 of 43\n \n1  during sweeps. FFE does this because unsheltered individuals may become ill if they do not \n2  have access to shade or water and are exposed to heat because of a sweep.  \n3  91.  FFE would not have to expend these resources on behalf of its members if the \n4  City stopped conducting raids and unlawfully seizing individualsโ property. \n5  92.  If FFE did not have to expend resources helping unsheltered individuals \n6  understand their rights in response to Defendants raids and criminal citations, FFE could \n7  spend  resources  training  unsheltered  individuals  to  become  their  own  advocates  in \n8  requesting resources from the City for housing and shelter. \n9  93.  If FFE did not have to expend resources helping unsheltered individuals \n10  understand their rights in response to Defendants raids and criminal citations, FFE could \n11  also distribute more water and food to the unsheltered community during the summer \n12  months. FFE could also provide more supplies to the unsheltered community which would \n13  improve individualsโ quality of life. \n14  FFE Membersโ Experiences \n15  94.  Plaintiff Timothy James is a resident of Phoenix, an FFE member, and an \n16  involuntarily unhoused individual.  \n17  95.   On March 29, 2024, PPD threatened to issue a citation against Mr. James for \n18  sleeping on the ground. \n19  96.  During this encounter, PPD officers followed  Mr. James and repeatedly \n20  instructed him to take his belongings with him, or else face a citation. \n21  97.  In April and May 2024, PPD cited Mr. James five times for violations of the \n22  Sleeping Ban under Phoenix City Code ยง 23-48.01, and the City is actively prosecuting him \n23  for these alleged offenses. \n24  98.  Plaintiff Sherdina Carr is a resident of Phoenix, an FFE member, and an \n25  involuntarily unhoused individual. \n26  99.  PPD threatened to issue a citation against Ms. Carr for sleeping on the ground \n27  and directed her to move.  \n28 \n   \n- 20 - \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02041-GMS   Document 159   Filed 07/12/24   Page 21 of 43\n \n1  100.  PPD officers followed Ms. Carr to her new location on a different block, and, \n2  under threat of citation, forced her to walk for over an hour to avoid receiving a citation \n3  from them.  \n4  101.  Plaintiff Papy Abdul Idrissa is a resident of Phoenix, an FFE member, and an \n5  involuntarily unhoused individual.  \n6  102.  PPD threatened to issue a citation against Mr. Idrissa for sleeping on the \n7  ground and directed him to move.  \n8  103.  PPD officers followed Mr. Idrissa to his new location on a different block. \n9  Mr. Idrissa walked for more than an hour to be out of PPDโs sights, and to no longer be \n10  subject to PPDโs threats of a citation.  \n11  104.  Plaintiff Faith Kearns is a resident of Phoenix and an FFE member and has \n12  been chronically unsheltered since approximately 2008. While sleeping within the City as \n13  an  involuntarily  unhoused  individual,  Ms.  Kearns  has  experienced  the  Cityโs  โclean \n14  sweeps,โ or raids, firsthand. \n15  105.  During one such raid, the PPD officers took Ms. Kearnsโ Arizona ID card, a \n16  Visa Card on which  her social  security  disability income was loaded, tent, blankets, \n17  bedding, birth certificate, medications, and clothing. \n18  106.  Ms. Kearns also received citations, including fines, from the City under the \n19  Camping Ban, Sleeping Ban, and Trespassing Ban. \n20  107.  Plaintiff Frank Urban is a resident of Phoenix and an FFE member and has \n21  been chronically unsheltered off and on since 2000. \n22  108.  While sleeping outside as an involuntarily unhoused person in various parts \n23  of the City, Mr. Urban has directly experienced the Cityโs raids. \n24  109.  During the raids, PPD officers took Mr. Urbanโs Arizona ID card, tent, \n25  blankets, bedding, medications, clothing, food, and water. \n26  110.  Mr. Urban also received citations, including fines, from the City under the \n27  Camping Ban and Sleeping Ban. \n28 \n   \n- 21 - \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02041-GMS   Document 159   Filed 07/12/24   Page 22 of 43\n \n1  Plaintiff Ronnie Massingilleโs Experience \n2  111.  Mr. Massingille is a resident of Maricopa County and currently resides in \n3  Phoenix.  \n4  112.  Mr. Massingille is currently involuntarily unhoused.  \n5  113.  Mr. Massingille commonly sleeps outside in various parts of the City. \n6  114.  While sleeping and encamped, Mr. Massingille has directly experienced the \n7  Cityโs raids and the actions of PPD.  \n8  115.  Mr. Massingilleโs possessions were seized and thrown away numerous times \n9  during the Cityโs sweeps. \n10  116.  He was never provided with a search warrant. \n11  117.  During the sweeps, PPD officers took Mr. Massingilleโs Arizona ID card, \n12  birth certificate, tent, a suitcase, clothes/shoes, skateboards, and medication.  \n13  118.  As an unsheltered individual in the City, Mr. Massingille lives with a constant \n14  fear PPD will arrest him, criminally cite him for sleeping outside, or destroy his property.  \n15  Plaintiff Mohamed Sissohoโs Experience  \n16  119.  Plaintiff Mohamed Sissoho is a resident of Phoenix.  \n17  120.  Mr. Sissoho is currently involuntarily unhoused. \n18  121.  Mr. Sissoho has unsuccessfully sought a shelter bed multiple times.   \n19  122.  In November 2022, Mr. Sissoho was at the corner of Jefferson Street and 11th \n20  Avenue when PPD conducted a raid.  \n21  123.  Mr. Sissoho received no advance notice that PPD or the City would be \n22  conducting a raid or any sort of operation.  \n23  124.  During this raid, PPD seized and destroyed Mr. Sissohoโs property without \n24  his consent and without a warrant.  \n25  125.  Specifically, PPD seized Mr. Sissohoโs tent, sleeping bags, food stamps, \n26  social security card, letters, and jewelry.  \n27  126.  PPD did not inform Mr. Sissoho how he could reclaim his property or even \n28  where it was being taken.  \n   \n- 22 - \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02041-GMS   Document 159   Filed 07/12/24   Page 23 of 43\n \n1  127.  Mr. Sissoho has not been able to recover the property that PPD seized from \n2  him. \n3  128.  Without his tent, it has been hard for Mr. Sissoho to protect himself from the \n4  sun and sweltering heat.  \n5  129.  In October 2023, Mr. Sissoho was sleeping in the area near 12th Avenue and \n6  Madison Street (formerly known as โthe Zoneโ). Mr. Sissoho recalls the City conducting a \n7  sweep in the early morning hours starting around 6:00 AM.  Mr. Sissoho recalls being \n8  roused by PPD officers who forced him, under threat of citation with the Trespassing Bans, \n9  to move elsewhere.  \n10  130.  During  this  sweep,  the  City  cited  Mr.  Sissoho  for  a  violation  of  the \n11  Trespassing Bans. \n12  131.  During this sweep, the City took the majority of his items, including his tent, \n13  clothes, and other survival items. Mr. Sissoho was never given information about how to \n14  recover these items. Because of the Cityโs sweeps, Mr. Sissoho only carries with him those \n15  items that he can tuck into the sides of his wheelchair. \n16  132.  In April 2024, PPD threatened Mr. Sissoho with a citation for sleeping in his \n17  wheelchair in public.  \n18  133.  PPD forced Mr. Sissoho to move elsewhere but did not provide Mr. Sissoho \n19  any assistance or information on services, resources, or shelters. \n20  134.  Mr. Sissoho is worried about the approaching summer and how he will \n21  survive the increasing heat without a tent (which provided shade to him).   \n22  Plaintiff Dyrwood Mooreโs Experience  \n23  135.  Plaintiff Dyrwood Moore is a resident of Phoenix, Arizona.  \n24  136.  Mr. Moore is currently involuntarily unhoused.  \n25  137.  In September 2023, Mr. Moore was living on Monroe Street, near the CASS \n26  Shelter when PPD conducted a raid without prior warning.  \n27  138.  Mr. Moore was not present during the September 2023 raid. He would not \n28  have left his belongings in and near his tent if he had received notice ahead of the raid.  \n   \n- 23 - \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02041-GMS   Document 159   Filed 07/12/24   Page 24 of 43\n \n1  139.  The City confiscated or destroyed Mr. Mooreโs belongings without providing \n2  him with a means to retrieve them.  \n3  140.  Specifically, PPD seized Mr. Mooreโs tent, clothes, barbeque grill, bicycle, \n4  and shoes. \n5  141.  Mr. Moore has not been able to retrieve his personal property since the Cityโs \n6  confiscation. \n7  142.  In March 2024, Mr. Moore was living near the corner of N. 22nd Avenue and \n8  West Portland Street when PPD conducted a raid without prior warning.  \n9  143.  Mr. Moore was not present during the March 2024 raid, but left his belongings \n10  in and near the tent where he was staying.   \n11  144.  The City confiscated or destroyed Mr. Mooreโs belongings without providing \n12  him with a means to retrieve them.   \n13  145.  Specifically,  PPD  seized  Mr.  Mooreโs  tent,  shade  for  heat  protection, \n14  disability documentation, blankets, clothes, food, and water.  \n15 \n146.  On March 14, 2024, Mr. Moore contacted OHS to see if he would be able to \n16 \nrecover his belongings. \n17 \n147.  OHS has not responded to Mr. Mooreโs inquiry. He remains without the \n18 \nbelongings that PPD took from him during the March 2024 raid.  \n19 \n148.  Without his tent and shade for heat protection, it has been difficult for Mr. \n20 \nMoore to stay out of the direct sun.  \n21 \n149.  The increased heat experienced by Mr. Moore has at times caused him to feel \n22 \nfaint and exhausted. As temperatures increase, he worries that the loss of his tent and shade \n23 \nwill cause him to become ill.    \n24 \nPlaintiff Faith Kearnsโ Experience \n25 \n150.  Ms. Kearns is a resident of Phoenix, Arizona. \n26 \n151.  Due to various medical issues and the costs associated with medical care, she \n27 \nhas been chronically unsheltered since approximately 2008. \n28 \n   \n- 24 - \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02041-GMS   Document 159   Filed 07/12/24   Page 25 of 43\n \n1  152.  When she is unsheltered, Ms. Kearns sleeps on the public streets of Phoenix. \n2  153.  While sleeping within the City as an unsheltered individual, Ms. Kearns has \n3  experienced the raids firsthand. Based on Ms. Kearnsโ recollection, the raids occurred about \n4  three to five days per week, with an uptick during and around holidays.  \n5  154.  During  the  Cityโs  raids,  Ms.  Kearns  has  had  personal  possessions  and \n6  belongings destroyed. \n7  155.  During the Cityโs raids, PPD and other City workers took the following from \n8  Ms. Kearns: an Arizona ID card, a Visa Card on which her Social Security disability income \n9  was loaded, tent, blankets, bedding, birth certificate, medications, and clothing. \n10  156.  Ms. Kearns watched as PPD and other City workers destroyed these items, \n11  among others.  \n12  157.  Ms. Kearns never received a search warrant for the property that the City \n13  seized through its agents. \n14  158.  Ms. Kearns also remembers receiving  citations from the  City  under the \n15  Jaywalking Law, Camping Ban, and Sleeping Ban. \n16  159.  Ms. Kearns has received other citations related to her unsheltered status such \n17  as a citation for trespassing. \n18  160.  Ms. Kearns believes the Cityโs raids are intended to push her out of the City. \n19  Plaintiff Frank Urbanโs Experience \n20  161.  Mr. Urban is a resident of Maricopa County and currently resides in Phoenix. \n21  162.  Due to various medical issues, Mr. Urban became chronically unsheltered off \n22  and on starting in 2000. \n23  163.  During the time periods when Mr. Urban has been unsheltered, he has slept \n24  outside in various parts of the City. \n25  164.  During these times, Mr. Urban has directly experienced the Cityโs raids. \n26  These raids intensified around Thanksgiving and Christmas.  \n27 \n28 \n   \n- 25 - \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02041-GMS   Document 159   Filed 07/12/24   Page 26 of 43\n \n1  165.  During the Cityโs raids, Mr. Urban has had his possessions thrown away \n2  numerous times. Specifically, PPD and other City workers took from him and destroyed: \n3  an Arizona ID card, tent, blankets, bedding, medications, clothing, food, and water. \n4  166.  Mr. Urban never received a search warrant for the property that the City \n5  seized through its agents. \n6  167.  Mr. Urban also recalls receiving citations from the City under the Camping \n7  Ban and Sleeping Ban. \n8  168.  Mr. Urban has received other citations from the City in connection to his \n9  unsheltered status. \n10  Plaintiff Timothy Jamesโs Experience \n11  169.  Mr. James is a resident of Phoenix, Arizona. \n12  170.  Mr. James is currently involuntarily unhoused. \n13  171.  Mr. James is constantly forced to move around the city to flee the PPDโs \n14  persistent harassment and threats against Mr. James for sitting or sleeping in public. \n15  172.  On April 3, 2024, PPD cited Mr. James for lying or sitting in public in \n16  violation of Phoenix City Code ยง 23-48.01. \n17  173.  On April 12, 2024, Mr. James was at the intersection of Jackson St. and 11th \n18  Avenue when PPD cited Mr. James for lying or sitting in public in violation of Phoenix \n19  City Code ยง 23-48.01. \n20  174.  After PPD cited Mr. James, they forced him to move elsewhere. \n21  175.   On April 19, 2024, Mr. James was woken up and arrested by PPD for \n22  sleeping in public in violation of Phoenix City Code ยง 23-48.01.  \n23  176.  Mr. James spent the night in jail before being released.  \n24  177.  On May 1, 2024, PPD again cited Mr. James for lying or sitting in public in \n25  violation of Phoenix City Code ยง 23-48.01. \n26  178.  On May 19, 2024, PPD again cited Mr. James for lying or sitting in public in \n27  violation of Phoenix City Code ยง 23-48.01. \n28 \n   \n- 26 - \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02041-GMS   Document 159   Filed 07/12/24   Page 27 of 43\n \n1  179.  PPD did not provide Mr. James with any information on shelters, resources, \n2  or services during these encounters, yet the City is actively prosecuting Mr. James for these \n3  alleged offenses.  \n4  Plaintiff Sherdina Carrโs Experience \n5  180.  Ms. Carr is a resident of Phoenix, Arizona. \n6  181.  Ms. Carr is currently involuntarily unhoused. \n7  182.  Ms. Carr walks around the city for hours at a time to escape PPDโs harassment \n8  and threats. \n9  183.  After the closure of the Zone, Ms. Carr has been forced by PPD to relocate \n10  countless times.  \n11  184.  Recently, Ms. Carr was trying to find a shaded area to sit down when PPD \n12  threatened her with a citation unless she moved elsewhere. \n13  185.  PPD followed Ms. Carr while she was walking around trying to find a new \n14  location.  \n15  186.  Once Ms. Carr found a new location, PPD immediately threatened her with a \n16  citation unless she moved again.  \n17  187.  PPD, again, followed her while she walked around and looked for a third \n18  location to sit down. \n19  188.  PPD never offered Ms. Carr information on services, shelter, or resources.  \n20  Plaintiff Papy Abdul Idrissaโs Experience  \n21  189.   Mr. Idrissa is a resident of Phoenix, Arizona. \n22  190.   Mr. Idrissa is currently involuntarily unhoused.  \n23  191.  PPD forces Mr. Idrissa to relocate on a nearly daily basis. \n24  192.   On April 19, 2024, Mr. Idrissa was sitting in a shaded area of a park when \n25  PPD threatened Mr. Idrissa with a citation or arrest. \n26  193.   PPD forced Mr. Idrissa to leave the shaded area and relocate to an unshaded \n27  area. \n28 \n   \n- 27 - \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02041-GMS   Document 159   Filed 07/12/24   Page 28 of 43\n \n1  194.  Mr. Idrissa then walked to another shaded area where PPD again threatened \n2  Mr. Idrissa with a citation and arrest.  \n3  195.  PPD continued to follow, harass, and threaten Mr. Idrissa as he walked around \n4  trying to find another shaded area to sit.  \n5  196.  In February or March 2024, Mr. Idrissaโs friend was sleeping in the shade \n6  near the CASS Shelter when he was forced to move elsewhere.  \n7  197.  Mr. Idrissaโs friend relocated to the park at the intersection of 13th Avenue \n8  and Van Buren. \n9  198.  That same day, Mr. Idrissaโs friend died from sun/heat exposure.  \n10  199.  In April 2024, PPD harassed Mr. Idrissa and other unhoused people at a bus \n11  stop near 15th Avenue and Fillmore. During this incident, PPD threatened Mr. Idrissa and \n12  other unhoused individuals with citations and arrests. PPD then forced these individuals, \n13  including Mr. Idrissa, to leave the shaded bus stop and move into areas unprotected from \n14  sun and heat exposure.  \n15  Plaintiff Jason Richโs Experience  \n16  200.  Mr. Rich is a resident of Phoenix, Arizona. \n17  201.  Mr. Rich is currently involuntarily unhoused.  \n18  202.  Around January 2024, Mr. Rich was sleeping on a bench when he was woken \n19  up by PPD sticking a taser in his back.  \n20  203.  While citing and arresting Mr. Rich, PPD seized all his personal property and \n21  belongings.  \n22  204.  Specifically,  PPD  seized  Mr.  Richโs  medications,  hygiene  supplies, \n23  cellphone, identification, and backpack.  \n24  205.  PPD did not let Mr. Rich inquire as to where his belongings were being taken. \n25  206.  During this incident, PPD did not provide Mr. Rich with any information on \n26  services, resources, or shelters. \n27  207.  After being released, PPD has often harassed Mr. Rich for sitting or lying in \n28  public.  \n   \n- 28 - \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02041-GMS   Document 159   Filed 07/12/24   Page 29 of 43\n \n1  208.  PPD has forced Mr. Rich to move late at night under the threat of a citation \n2  or arrest. \n3  209.  Around February 2024, Mr. Rich was near CASS around 5:00 a.m. when PPD \n4  began patrolling the area and citing unhoused persons.  \n5  210.  PPD threatened Mr. Rich with a citation for trespassing if he did not leave the \n6  area and move elsewhere. \n7  211.  PPD did not provide Mr. Rich with any information on services, resources, or \n8  shelters during these encounters.  \n9  CLAIMS FOR RELIEF \n10  Count One \n11  (Fourth Amendment ViolationโUnlawful Seizure) \n12  (42 U.S.C. ยง 1983) \n13  (All Defendants) \n14  212.  Plaintiffs re-allege the foregoing paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n15  213.  At all times relevant to the allegations in this Complaint, Defendants acted \n16  under color of state law. \n17  214.  Under  the  Fourth  Amendment  to  the  United  States  Constitution,  as \n18  incorporated against the states by the Fourteenth Amendment, Plaintiffs have the right to \n19  be secure in their persons against unreasonable seizures. A seizure of property occurs under \n20  the Fourth Amendment when there is some meaningful interference with an individualโs \n21  possessory  interests  in  that  property;  meaningful  interferences  include  destruction  of \n22  property. See United States v. Jacobsen, 466 U.S. 109, 113 (1984). \n23  215.  Property includes photographs, identification papers, portable electronics, \n24  and even potentially abandoned property. See Lavan v. City of Los Angeles, 693 F.3d 1022, \n25  1030 (9th Cir. 2012). \n26  216.  Here, Defendants, pursuant to the Cityโs policies, procedures, customs, and/or \n27  protocols, have engaged and will continue to engage in targeted raids of areas occupied by \n28  the unsheltered community. \n   \n- 29 - \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02041-GMS   Document 159   Filed 07/12/24   Page 30 of 43\n \n1  217.  During  these  raids,  Defendants  unreasonably  seize  and  destroy  property \n2  regardless of its condition, its apparent value, and/or whether or not it has been voluntarily \n3  abandoned. \n4  218.  Individual Plaintiffs as well as other unhoused people who are members of \n5  FFE or served by FFE have experienced destruction of their personal items by Defendants, \n6  including the destruction of photographs, identification papers, camping equipment, and \n7  other unabandoned personal items, within the past three years. \n8  219.  Plaintiffs have seen the destruction of personal items of other unsheltered \n9  individuals, including items deemed abandoned by Defendants, within the past three years. \n10  220.  By seizing and destroying the property of the individual Plaintiffs, individuals \n11  served by FFE, and FFE members, Defendants meaningfully and permanently interfered \n12  with these individualsโ possessory interest in their property and unlawfully seized that \n13  property. \n14  221.  At no time did Defendants provide a warrant to seize the property of the \n15  individual Plaintiffs, individuals served by FFE, or FFEโs members.  \n16  222.  Seizures without a warrant are presumptively unconstitutional. \n17  223.  Defendants engage in warrantless seizures of property when no exception to \n18  the warrant requirement applies. \n19  224.  Plaintiffs, individuals served by FFE, and FFEโs members have a possessory \n20  interest in their property under the Fourth Amendment. \n21  225.  A  reasonable  official  in  Interim  Chief  Sullivanโs  and  Director  Milneโs \n22  position would have known that seizing and destroying Plaintiffsโ property and the property \n23  of individuals served by FFE and FFE members constitutes a violation of the Fourth \n24  Amendment. \n25  226.  Defendantsโ actions were the direct and proximate cause of Plaintiffsโ loss of \n26  property and the loss of property of the individuals served by FFE and FFE members.  \n27 \n28 \n   \n- 30 - \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02041-GMS   Document 159   Filed 07/12/24   Page 31 of 43\n \n1  227.  The acts of Defendants were intentional and deprived Plaintiffs, individuals \n2  served by FFE, and FFE members of their rights, privileges, liberties, and immunities \n3  secured by the Constitution of the United States. \n4  228.  Defendants were at all times relevant agents of the City vested with the power \n5  to control and supervise employees, agents, and contractors of the City. \n6  229.  Upon information and belief, Defendants acted in execution of government \n7  policy or custom that may fairly be said to represent the official policy of the City. See \n8  Monell v. Depโt of Soc. Servs. of N.Y., 436 U.S. 658, 694 (1978). \n9  230.  Defendantsโ actions were authorized (before and during the fact) and ratified \n10  (after the fact) by final policymakers for the City. \n11  231.  Defendants directed every action of their agents, thereby causing the violation \n12  of Plaintiffsโ rights, the rights of individuals served by FFE, and FFE membersโ rights, and \n13  were deliberately indifferent to the fact that their directives would result in the violation of \n14  such rights. \n15  232.  Defendantsโ customs, policies and/or practices, and the decisions of its final \n16  policymakers  caused  Defendantsโ  violation  of  Plaintiffsโ  constitutional  rights,  the \n17  constitutional rights of individuals served by FFE, and FFE membersโ constitutional rights. \n18  233.  Defendantsโ actions, as described herein, were motivated by malice and/or \n19  involved reckless or callous indifference to Plaintiffsโ federally protected constitutional \n20  rights, the federally protected constitutional rights of individuals served by FFE, and FFE \n21  membersโ federally protected constitutional rights. Defendants engaged in these actions and \n22  omissions intentionally, willfully, and/or wantonly, demonstrating deliberate indifference \n23  to, and a reckless disregard for, such constitutionally protected rights. \n24  234.  Defendants  have  or  should  have  policies,  procedures,  practices,  and/or \n25  customs to govern the raids to prevent the deprivations that occurred. Defendants have \n26  instead used or employed policies, procedures, practices, and/or customs that penalize \n27  unsheltered individuals for their status and destroy the property of Plaintiffs, individuals \n28  served by FFE, and FFE members. \n   \n- 31 - \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02041-GMS   Document 159   Filed 07/12/24   Page 32 of 43\n \n1  235.  Defendant City of Phoenix and the PPDโs policies, procedures, practices, \n2  and/or customs should require agents or employees of the City to refrain from destroying \n3  unsheltered Plaintiffsโ possessions during such raids. \n4  236.  Defendants failed to train or supervise their employees when conducting raids \n5  of unsheltered populations such as Plaintiffs, individuals served by FFE, and FFE members, \n6  resulting in the criminalization of their unsheltered status and destruction of their property. \n7  237.  As a direct and proximate result of Defendantsโ acts or omissions pursuant to \n8  official government policy, practice, or custom, Plaintiffs, individuals served by FFE, and \n9  FFE members suffered (without limitation) a deprivation of constitutional rights. \n10  238.  Plaintiffs are entitled to damages in an amount to be determined by a jury. \n11  Count Two \n12  (Fourteenth Amendment Violation โ Deprivation of Property without Due Process) \n13  (42 U.S.C. ยง 1983) \n14  (All Defendants) \n15  239.  Plaintiffs re-allege the foregoing paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n16  240.  The Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides that \n17  no state shall โdeprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.โ \n18  241.  Under the Fourteenth Amendment, โthe government may not take property \n19  like a thief in the night; rather, it must announce its intentions and give the property owner \n20  a chance to argue against the taking.โ Clement v. City of Glendale, 518 F.3d 1090, 1093 \n21  (9th Cir. 2008). \n22  242.  Violation of city ordinances does not constitute a waiver of due process \n23  interests in a previously recognized property interest. \n24  243.  The property of those experiencing homelessness is โpropertyโ within the \n25  meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment, meaning a government entity โmust comport with \n26  the requirements of the Fourteenth Amendmentโs due process clause if it wishes to take and \n27  destroy them.โ Lavan, 693 F.3d at 1032. \n28 \n   \n- 32 - \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02041-GMS   Document 159   Filed 07/12/24   Page 33 of 43\n \n1  244.  Here, Defendants, pursuant to the Cityโs policies, procedures, customs, and/or \n2  protocols, have engaged and will continue to engage in raids that target the unsheltered \n3  community living within the City. \n4  245.  Pursuant  to  the  Cityโs  policies,  procedures,  customs,  and/or  protocols, \n5  Defendants employed these raids without adequate notice to Plaintiffs. \n6  246.  During these raids, Defendants seized and destroyed Plaintiffsโ property and \n7  the property of individuals served by FFE and FFE members without affording them \n8  adequate notice that their property would be seized or destroyed. \n9  247.  Plaintiffs, individuals served by FFE, and FFE members rely on this property \n10  for survival. It is all they have. Compared with that extremely high interest in their property, \n11  any administrative burden on the City to provide additional process to prevent erroneous \n12  deprivation is low. \n13  248.  Plaintiffsโ property and the property of individuals served by FFE and FFE \n14  members was not seized in connection with prosecution or investigation of any crime. \n15  249.  Defendants destroyed Plaintiffsโ property and the property of individuals \n16  served by FFE and FFE members without affording them a post-deprivation process for \n17  challenging the seizure of their property. \n18  250.  It is clearly established Plaintiffs and individuals served by FFE and FFE \n19  members have a right to due process and post-deprivation hearings when their property is \n20  unlawfully seized and destroyed. \n21  251.  A  reasonable  official  in  Interim  Chief  Sullivanโs  and  Director  Milneโs \n22  position would have known that seizing and destroying property without due process of law \n23  violates the Fourteenth Amendment. \n24  252.  Defendantsโ unconstitutional acts were the direct and proximate cause of the \n25  seizure, destruction, and loss of Plaintiffsโ property and the property of individuals served \n26  by FFE and FFE members. \n27 \n28 \n   \n- 33 - \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02041-GMS   Document 159   Filed 07/12/24   Page 34 of 43\n \n1  253.  The  acts  of  Defendants  were  intentional  and  deprived  Plaintiffs  and \n2  individuals served by FFE and FFE members of their rights, privileges, liberties, and \n3  immunities secured by the Constitution of the United States. \n4  254.  Defendants were at all times relevant agents of the City vested with the power \n5  to control and supervise employees, agents, and contractors of the City. \n6  255.  Upon information and belief, Defendants acted in execution of government \n7  policy or custom that may fairly be said to represent the official policy of the City. See \n8  Monell v. Depโt of Soc. Servs. of N.Y., 436 U.S. 658, 694 (1978). \n9  256.  Defendantsโ actions were authorized (before and during the fact) and ratified \n10  (after the fact) by final policymakers for the City. \n11  257.  Defendants directed every action of their agents, thereby causing the violation \n12  of Plaintiffsโ rights, the rights of individuals served by FFE, and FFE membersโ rights, and \n13  were deliberately indifferent to the fact that their directives would result in the violation of \n14  such rights. \n15  258.  Defendantsโ customs, policies and/or practices, and the decisions of its final \n16  policymakers  caused  Defendantsโ  violation  of  Plaintiffsโ  constitutional  rights,  the \n17  constitutional rights of individuals served by FFE, and FFE membersโ constitutional rights. \n18  259.  Defendantsโ actions, as described herein, were motivated by malice and/or \n19  involved reckless or callous indifference to Plaintiffsโ federally protected constitutional \n20  rights, the federally protected constitutional rights of individuals served by FFE, and FFE \n21  membersโ federally protected constitutional rights. Defendants engaged in these actions and \n22  omissions intentionally, willfully, and/or wantonly, demonstrating deliberate indifference \n23  to, and a reckless disregard for, such constitutionally protected rights. \n24  260.  Defendants  have  or  should  have  policies,  procedures,  practices,  and/or \n25  customs to govern the raids to prevent the deprivations that occurred. Defendants have \n26  instead used or employed policies, procedures, practices, and/or customs that penalize \n27  unsheltered individuals for their status and destroy the property of Plaintiffs, individuals \n28  served by FFE, and FFE members. \n   \n- 34 - \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02041-GMS   Document 159   Filed 07/12/24   Page 35 of 43\n \n1  261.  Defendant City of Phoenix and the PPDโs policies, procedures, practices, \n2  and/or customs should require agents or employees of the City to refrain from destroying \n3  unsheltered Plaintiffsโ possessions during such raids. \n4  262.  Defendants failed to train or supervise their employees when conducting raids \n5  of unsheltered populations such as Plaintiffs, individuals served by FFE, and FFE members, \n6  resulting in the destruction of their property. As a direct and proximate result of Defendantsโ \n7  acts or omissions pursuant to official government policy, practice, or custom, Plaintiffs, \n8  individuals served by FFE, and FFE members suffered (without limitation) a deprivation of \n9  constitutional rights. \n10  263.  Plaintiffs are entitled to damages in an amount to be determined by a jury. \n11  Count Three \n12  (Eighth AmendmentโExcessive Fines) \n13  (All Defendants) \n14  264.  Plaintiffs re-allege the foregoing paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n15  265.  The  Eighth  Amendment  to  the  United  States  Constitution  prohibits  the \n16  imposition of excessive fines. \n17  266.  The  Excessive  Fines  Clause  โlimits  the  governmentโs  power  to  extract \n18  payments, whether in case or in kind, as a punishment for some offense.โ  Austin v. United \n19  States, 509 U.S. 602, 609-10 (1993). A fine violates the Eighth Amendment if it is โgrossly \n20  disproportional to the gravity of the defendantโs offense.โ United States v. Bajakajian, 524 \n21  U.S. 321, 336โ37 (1998).  \n22  267.  The  Excessive  Fines  Clause  applies  to  fines  assessed  by  municipalities. \n23  Pimental v. City of Los Angeles, 974 F.3d 917, 922 (9th Cir. 2020).  \n24  268.  To determine whether a fine is unconstitutionally excessive under the Eighth \n25  Amendment, courts are not required to consider rigid factors but commonly consider: โ(1) \n26  the nature and extent of the crime; (2) whether the violation was related to other illegal \n27  activities; (3) the other penalties that may be imposed for the violation; and (4) the extent \n28  of the harm caused.โ U.S. v. $100,348.00 in U.S. Currency, 354 F.3d 1110, 1121โ22 (9th \n   \n- 35 - \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02041-GMS   Document 159   Filed 07/12/24   Page 36 of 43\n \n1  Cir. 2004) (citing Bajakajian, 524 U.S. at 337โ40). None of these factors supports the fines \n2  imposed by the City against its unhoused population when they have nowhere else to go.  \n3  269.  Here, Defendant City of Phoenix has imposed fines on Plaintiffs, individuals \n4  served by FFE, and FFE members for violation of the Sleeping Ban, Camping Ban, and \n5  Trespassing Bans.   \n6  270.  Plaintiffs, individuals served by FFE, and FFE members who are fined for \n7  violation of the Sleeping Ban, Camping Ban, and Trespassing Bans are indigent, with no \n8  ability to pay any fine, let alone the multiple fines imposed upon them by the City. \n9  271.  The imposition of fines against Plaintiffs, individuals served by FFE, and FFE \n10  members causes serious harm, including through the collateral consequences that follow, \n11  and create additional impediments to becoming housed, perpetuating the likelihood that \n12  they will need to sleep outside again, thereby risking exposure to further citations, fines, \n13  and arrests.  \n14  272.  The fines imposed on Plaintiffs, individuals served by FFE, and FFE members \n15  for such violations are grossly disproportional to the gravity of the offense.  \n16  273.  Sleeping is a basic human need, and Plaintiffs, individuals served by FFE, \n17  and FFE members lack culpability for sleeping in a public place when they have nowhere \n18  else to go.  \n19  274.  The City fines individuals, including Plaintiffs, individuals served by FFE, \n20  and FFE members even though sleeping on the street is not in furtherance of other illegal \n21  activities.  \n22  275.  Sleeping on the street causes negligible harm to the City.  \n23  276.  There is no government purpose for proscribing sleeping on the street when \n24  an individual has no other place to go.  \n25  277.  Plaintiffs, individuals served by FFE, and members of FFE are unable to \n26  afford the fines imposed on them for violation of the Sleeping Ban, Camping Ban, and \n27  Trespassing Bans.  \n28 \n   \n- 36 - \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02041-GMS   Document 159   Filed 07/12/24   Page 37 of 43\n \n1  278.  In light of the minor nature of the violations and their financial effects on \n2  Plaintiffs, individuals served by FFE, and FFE members, the aforementioned fines are \n3  punitive in nature and are grossly excessive and disproportional to the behavior for which \n4  Defendants are imposing these fines. The dollar amount enforcement of these penalties \n5  constitutes a violation of the Eighth Amendmentโs Excessive Fines clause, as incorporated \n6  by the Fourteenth Amendment.   \n7  279.  It is clearly established that excessively fining Plaintiffs, individuals served \n8  by FFE, and FFE members for sleeping in public spaces when  indoor shelter is not \n9  practically available to them is a violation of their constitutional rights. \n10  280.  A reasonable official in Interim Chief Sullivanโs position would have known \n11  that fining Plaintiffs, individuals served by FFE, and FFE members for sleeping in public \n12  spaces when indoor shelter is not practically available constituted a violation of their Eighth \n13  Amendment rights. \n14  281.  The acts of Defendants were intentional and violated the constitutional rights \n15  of Plaintiffs, individuals served by FFE, and FFE members to be free from excessive fines.  \n16  282.  Defendants were at all times relevant agents of the City vested with the power \n17  to control and supervise employees, agents, and contractors of the City. \n18  283.  Upon information and belief, Defendants acted in execution of government \n19  policy or custom that may fairly be said to represent the official policy of the City. See \n20  Monell v.

Defendantsโ actions were authorized (before and during the fact) and ratified \n22  (after the fact) by final policymakers for the City. \n23  285.  Defendants directed every action of their agents, thereby causing the violation \n24  of Plaintiffsโ rights, the rights of individuals served by FFE, and FFE membersโ rights, and \n25  were deliberately indifferent to the fact that their directives would result in the violation of \n26  such rights. \n27 \n28 \n   \n- 37 - \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02041-GMS   Document 159   Filed 07/12/24   Page 38 of 43\n \n1  286.  Defendantsโ customs, policies and/or practices, and the decisions of its final \n2  policymakers  caused  Defendantsโ  violation  of  Plaintiffsโ  constitutional  rights,  the \n3  constitutional rights of individuals served by FFE, and FFE membersโ constitutional rights. \n4  287.  Defendantsโ actions, as described herein, were motivated by malice and/or \n5  involved reckless or callous indifference to Plaintiffsโ federally protected constitutional \n6  rights, the federally protected constitutional rights of individuals served by FFE, and FFE \n7  membersโ federally protected constitutional rights. Defendants engaged in these actions and \n8  omissions intentionally, willfully, and/or wantonly, demonstrating deliberate indifference \n9  to, and a reckless disregard for, such constitutionally protected rights. \n10  288.  Plaintiffs are entitled to damages in an amount to be determined by a jury. \n11  Count Four \n12  (Fourteenth AmendmentโState Created Danger) \n13  (All Defendants) \n14  289.  Plaintiffs re-allege the foregoing paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n15  290.  The due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States \n16  Constitution prevents Defendants from placing Plaintiffs, individuals served by FFE, and \n17  FFE members in danger by acting with deliberate indifference to a known and obvious \n18  danger. \n19  291.  During the summer, temperatures in Phoenix can reach as high as 119 degrees \n20  Fahrenheit. \n21  292.  Without access to shade, temperatures can be even hotter. \n22  293.  Hundreds of unsheltered individuals die from heat-related exposure every \n23  summer in Phoenix.  \n24  294.  Each year, Maricopa County puts out a report on heat-related deaths. The City \n25  of Phoenix contributes to the report.39   \n26 \n27   \n39  2023  Heat  Related  Deaths  Report,  Maricopa  Cnty., \n28 \nhttps://www.maricopa.gov/ArchiveCenter/ViewFile/Item/5796 (last updated April 2024).  \n   \n- 38 - \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02041-GMS   Document 159   Filed 07/12/24   Page 39 of 43\n \n1  295.  Defendants  know  that  unsheltered  individuals,  including  Plaintiffs, \n2  individuals served by FFE, and FFE members, are at high risk for heat-related illness and \n3  death. \n4  296.  Defendants know that removing unsheltered individuals from shaded areas \n5  and destroying items that provide them with protection from the sun, including tents and \n6  tarps, increase those individualsโ exposure to the sun and their risk of heat-related illness \n7  and death. \n8  297.  Defendants make Plaintiffs, individuals served by FFE, and FFE members \n9  move from shaded areas protected from the sun under threat of arrest and citation during \n10  extremely hot temperatures, despite knowing that being forced to gather their belongings \n11  under these circumstances and leave shaded areas is dangerous to their health.  \n12  298.  Defendants confiscate and destroy tents, tarps, and other shade-providing \n13  structures used by Plaintiffs, individuals served by FFE, and FFE members to protect \n14  themselves from the sun during extremely hot temperatures, despite knowing that depriving \n15  these individuals of shade-providing structures under these circumstances is dangerous to \n16  their health.  \n17  299.  As a direct and proximate result of Defendantsโ actions, Plaintiffs, individuals \n18  served by FFE, and FFE members have been subjected to a heightened risk of heat-related \n19  illness or death that severely threatens their bodily security. \n20  300.  Defendants were at all times relevant agents of the City vested with the power \n21  to control and supervise employees, agents, and contractors of the City. \n22  301.  Upon information and belief, Defendants acted in execution of government \n23  policy or custom that may fairly be said to represent the official policy of the City. See \n24  Monell v. Depโt of Soc. Servs. of N.Y., 436 U.S. 658, 694 (1978). \n25  302.  Defendantsโ actions were authorized (before and during the fact) and ratified \n26  (after the fact) by final policymakers for the City. \n27  303.  Defendants directed every action of their agents, thereby causing the violation \n28  of Plaintiffsโ rights, the rights of individuals served by FFE, and FFE membersโ rights, and \n   \n- 39 - \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02041-GMS   Document 159   Filed 07/12/24   Page 40 of 43\n \n1  were deliberately indifferent to the fact that their directives would result in the violation of \n2  such rights. \n3  304.  Defendantsโ customs, policies and/or practices, and the decisions of its final \n4  policymakers  caused  Defendantsโ  violation  of  Plaintiffsโ  constitutional  rights,  the \n5  constitutional rights of individuals served by FFE, and FFE membersโ constitutional rights. \n6  305.  Defendantsโ actions, as described herein, were motivated by malice and/or \n7  involved reckless or callous indifference to Plaintiffsโ federally protected constitutional \n8  rights, the federally protected constitutional rights of individuals served by FFE, and FFE \n9  membersโ federally protected constitutional rights. Defendants engaged in these actions and \n10  omissions intentionally, willfully, and/or wantonly, demonstrating deliberate indifference \n11  to, and a reckless disregard for, such constitutionally protected rights. \n12  306.  Defendants  have  or  should  have  policies,  procedures,  practices,  and/or \n13  customs to govern the raids to prevent the deprivations that occurred. Defendants have \n14  instead used or employed policies, procedures, practices, and/or customs that penalize \n15  unsheltered individuals for their status and destroy the property of Plaintiffs, individuals \n16  served by FFE, and FFE members. \n17  307.  Defendant City of Phoenix and the PPDโs policies, procedures, practices, \n18  and/or customs should require agents or employees of the City to refrain from destroying \n19  unsheltered Plaintiffsโ possessions during such raids. \n20  308.  Defendants failed to train or supervise their employees when conducting raids \n21  of unsheltered populations such as Plaintiffs, individuals served by FFE, and FFE members, \n22  resulting in the criminalization of their unsheltered status and destruction of their property.  \n23  309.  As a direct and proximate result of Defendantsโ acts or omissions pursuant to \n24  official government policy, practice, or custom, Plaintiffs, individuals served by FFE, and \n25  FFE members suffered (without limitation) a deprivation of constitutional rights. \n26  PRAYER FOR RELIEF \n27  WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs pray for judgment against Defendants as follows: \n28  A.

Since 2010, the number of people experiencing homelessness in the City of \n3  Phoenix (the โCityโ or โPhoenixโ) has more than doubled.1 \n4  2.  Meanwhile sustainable solutions, including affordable housing, have lagged \n5  far behind. For example, as of the filing of this Complaint, the City has spent less than 10% \n6  of the $99.5 million it received from the federal government through the American Rescue \n7  Plan Act in order to address homelessness and affordable housing.2 \n8  3.  Despite  allocating  $16  million  for  temporary  shelter,  heat  relief,  and \n9  additional services for unsheltered individuals in Maricopa County (the โCountyโ), the City \n10  has spent less than five percent of these funds to date.3 Meanwhile, temperatures during the \n11  summer  averaged  106โ,  contributing  to  the  deaths  of  over  one  hundred  unsheltered \n12  individuals. \n13  4.  Notwithstanding  the  fact  that  shelters  are  only  a  temporary  solution  to \n14  homelessness, the Cityโs efforts to supply temporary shelter fall far short of the need. \n15  According to the January 2022 Point-in-Time count, which considerably undercounts the \n16  unsheltered population, 2,942 people in Phoenix were temporarily housed in an emergency \n17  shelter  or  transitional  housing  while  3,096  people  in  Phoenix  remained  completely \n18  unsheltered.4 \n19 \n20 \n \n21 \n1  Compare  MARICOPA  ASSโN  OF  GOVโTS,  2010  HOMELESS  STREET  COUNT, \nhttps://www.azmag.gov/Portals/0/Documents/MagContent/2010%20Point%20in%20Time\n22 \n%20Count%20for%20AZ-502%20(Municipal%20Street%20Count).pdf?ver=2017-07-07-\n134153-897 with MARICOPA ASSโN OF GOVโTS, 2022 POINT-IN-TIME (PIT) COUNT REPORT \n23 \n1,  https://www.azmag.gov/Portals/0/Documents/MagContent/2022-PIT-Count-Report-\nFinal.pdf?ver=mHByGa3hHNtmeOOfMZxctA%3d%3d. \n24 \n2  See  Erica  Stapleton,  Katie  Wilcox  &  John  Tanet,  โBuilding  housing  isnโt  a  quick \n25  processโ: Phoenix weighs in on millions in COVID relief money for homelessness that \nhasnโt been spent, 12 NEWS, https://www.12news.com/article/news/local/arizona/the-cost-\n26  of-crisis-phoenix-struggles-with-a-homelessness-crisis-after-covid/75-bd422dcb-4663-\n4b98-8f71-11aea9e76bda (last updated Sept. 1, 2022, 6:17 PM). \n27 \n3  American  Rescue  Plan  ActโAffordable  Housing  &  Homelessness,  CITY  OF  PHX., \nhttps://stories.opengov.com/phoenixaz/published/CcabFkLY8 (last visited Nov. 24, 2022). \n28 \n4 See 2022 POINT-IN-TIME (PIT) COUNT REPORT, supra note 1, at 4โ5. \n \n4860-6678-8680   \n  - 2 - \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02041-GMS   Document 45   Filed 01/13/23   Page 3 of 25\n \n1  5.  Since 2020, the unsheltered subset of the homeless population5 in the County, \n2  which includes Phoenix, grew by 34%. This means that the total number of unsheltered \n3  people in the County surpasses the number of this population in shelters (5,029 to 3,997).6 \n4  6.  Black,  Indigenous,  and  other  people  of  color  (โBIPOCโ  people)  are \n5  disproportionately  affected  by  this  crisis.  In  the  County,  Black  people  โexperience \n6  homelessness at a rate 3.9 times greater than their share of the general population.โ The \n7  Indigenous proportion of the homeless population in the County โis more than twice its \n8  share of the general population.\"7 \n9  7.  Many unsheltered persons congregate on the west side of downtown Phoenix \n10  in an area known as the โZone.โ The Zone is near the Human Services Campus which has \n11  provided wrap-around human services to help those in crisis achieve stability since 2005.8 \n12  8.  The  City  has  responded  to  this  growing  epidemic  of  homelessness  by \n13  directing the City of Phoenix Police Department (โPPDโ) to wage a campaign of raids called \n14  โclean sweepsโ to target those experiencing homelessness.9 \n15  9.  These raids by PPD criminalize, punish, and scatter this population based on \n16  their status as unsheltered despite the Cityโs knowledge that these individuals have nowhere \n17  else to go given the dearth of affordable housing and emergency shelter space.10 \n18 \n \n19  5The condition of being unsheltered denotes the lack of physical shelter, while โhomelessโ \nrefers to the lack of permanent housing experienced by people living in cars, temporary \n20  shelters, or with friends. \n6 See 2022 POINT-IN-TIME (PIT) COUNT REPORT, supra note 1, at 1, 4โ5. \n21 \n7  JEFF  OLIVET  &  DONALD  WHITEHEAD,  RACIAL  EQUITY  PARTNERS  ,  RACE  AND \n22  HOMELESSNESS IN MARICOPA COUNTY, ARIZONA: EXAMINING THE INTERSECTIONS 2, 7 \n(2021),  https://azmag.gov/Portals/0/Documents/MagContent/DRAFT-Maricopa-Racial-\n23  Equity-Report.pdf?ver=2021-02-04-154206-543. \n8 See Melissa Blasius, How Phoenix decides whatโs trash vs. property during controversial \n24 \nhomeless  camp  sweeps,  ABC15,  https://www.abc15.com/news/local-\nnews/investigations/how-phoenix-decides-whats-trash-vs-property-during-controversial-\n25 \nhomeless-camp-sweeps (last updated Mar. 6, 2022, 9:51 AM); About, HUMAN SERVICES \nCAMPUS, https://hsc-az.org/about/ (last visited November 28, 2022). \n26 \n9 Blasius, supra note 8. \n27 \n10 See Madeline Ackley, Phoenix still criminalizes homelessness, despite court ruling, \nprotesters say (Jan. 9, 2020, 9:13 AM),  https://www.azmirror.com/2020/01/09/phoenix-\n28 \nstill-criminalizes-homelessness-despite-court-ruling-protesters-say/. \n \n4860-6678-8680   \n  - 3 - \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02041-GMS   Document 45   Filed 01/13/23   Page 4 of 25\n \n1  10.  But  the  City  does  not  stop  at  criminalizing  residents  based  on  their \n2  unsheltered status. PPD officers performing raids also indiscriminately seize, impound, and \n3  destroy unsheltered individualsโ personal property and survival gear without cause or a \n4  warrant. \n5  11.  During these raids, unsheltered individuals (including Plaintiffs Faith Kearns, \n6  Frank Urban, and Ronnie Massingille) have lost clothing, survival equipment, medication, \n7  items of sentimental value (like photographs of loved ones), and, perhaps most inexplicably, \n8  vital records and identifying documentsโlike birth certificates and reference lettersโ\n9  which are crucial to procuring jobs, benefits, and housing. These documents can be almost \n10  impossible for someone with no fixed address to replace.11 \n11  12.  In  sum,  rather  than  confront  its  housing  crisis  head-on  and  invest  in \n12  sustainable solutions to homelessness, the City is terrorizing the very people it should be \n13  helping.  The  City  is  knowingly  penalizing  unsheltered  residents  for  engaging  in \n14  unavoidable human activities like sleeping and sheltering from the elements. Additionally, \n15  it is unlawfully seizing and destroying their personal property in an attempt to push the \n16  unsheltered out of the City all to avoid implementing alternative solutions which could \n17  provide relief to unsheltered individuals.12 \n18  JURISDICTION & VENUE \n19  13.

Venue is appropriate in this judicial district under 28 \n6  U.S.C. ยง 1391(b). \n7  PARTIES \n8  17.  Plaintiff Fund for Empowerment (โFFEโ) is an incorporated nonprofit charity \n9  operating in the County that commonly expends time, energy, effort, and resources on \n10  behalf of the unsheltered population. FFEโs mission is to build community resources for the \n11  unsheltered population via direct services, capacity-building training, and project support. \n12  FFE  helps  protect  and  advocate  for  the  dignity,  rights,  and  choices  of  Arizonans \n13  experiencing homelessness or housing insecurity. FFE commits its efforts toward goals \n14  affirmed  and  raised  by  unsheltered  individuals.  FFE  emphasizes  the  voices  of  the \n15  unsheltered to expose root causes of homelessness and to create ways of living in which \n16  everyone has a safe place they can call home. \n17  18.  Plaintiffs Faith Kearns and Frank Urban are members of FFE and graduates \n18  of FFEโs Houseless Leadership Project, which empowers unsheltered individuals with \n19  coping mechanisms and resources to achieve stability for themselves and others who are \n20  experiencing housing insecurity. \n21  19.

Plaintiffs will seek to amend this \n27  Complaint when and if the true identities of such people or entities become known. \n28   \n \n4860-6678-8680   \n  - 6 - \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02041-GMS   Document 45   Filed 01/13/23   Page 7 of 25\n \n1  GENERAL FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \n2  Background \n3  28.  The number of residents experiencing homelessness in Phoenix has nearly \n4  doubled  since  2010  according  to  Point-in-Time  (โPITโ)  counts  commissioned  by  the \n5  Maricopa Association of Governments (โMAGโ).13 \n6  29.  This increase directly relates to the Cityโs lack of affordable housing for \n7  residents that has only been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic.14 \n8  30.  Without  an  adequate  supply  of  affordable  housing,  people  can  become \n9  unsheltered after disruptions in household income caused by job loss, medical bankruptcy, \n10  mental illness, divorce, or domestic violence. \n11  31.  In 2010, about 1,750 unsheltered individuals were reported as experiencing \n12  homelessness in the PIT by MAG.15 \n13  32.  In 2020, the number of unsheltered individuals experiencing homelessness in \n14  the City increased to 2,380, according to the PIT.16 \n15  33.  In 2022, that number has further increased to 3,096.17 \n16  34.  Problematically,  despite  an  unsheltered  population  exceeding  3,000 \n17  individuals, the City only has approximately 1,788 shelter beds available for those who are \n18  experiencing homelessness.18 \n \n19 \n13 A PIT count is โan annual street and shelter count to determine the number of people \nexperiencing homelessness in Maricopa County during a given point in time.โ See Point-\n20 \nIn-Time  Homeless  Count,  MARICOPA  ASSโN  OF  GOVโTS,  \nhttps://azmag.gov/Programs/Homelessness/Data/Point-In-Time-Homeless-Count  (last \n21 \naccessed Nov. 28, 2022); 2010 HOMELESS STREET COUNT, supra note 1; 2022 POINT-IN-\n22  TIME (PIT) COUNT REPORT, supra note 1, at 1. \n14 Median home prices in Phoenix metro area grew by over 200% during the past decade, \n23  while the median income has grown only 16%. The average monthly rent in Phoenix also \nclimbed 60% in the last decade. \n24  15 See 2010 HOMELESS STREET COUNT, supra note 1. \n16  See  MARICOPA  ASSโN  OF  GOVโTS,  2020  POINT-IN-TIME  (PIT)  COUNT  REPORT  4, \n25 \nhttps://azmag.gov/Portals/0/Documents/MagContent/PIT-Count-Report-\n2020.pdf?ver=AiZpbG6pLfFUL6eOkvmc9A%3d%3d. \n26 \n17See 2022 POINT-IN-TIME (PIT) COUNT REPORT, supra note 1, at 4. \n27 \n18See  Strategies  to  Address  Homelessness,  CITY  OF  PHX.

Although the Phoenix City Council approved rezoning to allow an additional \n2  275 beds at Arizonaโs largest shelter, Central Arizona Shelter Services in the Human \n3  Services Campus, the increase remains inadequate to shelter the unsheltered population in \n4  Phoenix. \n5  36.  Moreover, while emergency shelters can temporarily accommodate some \n6  people experiencing homelessness, they are not an adequate response to Phoenixโs rapid \n7  increase in unsheltered residents. Research shows that the most effective way to end chronic \n8  homelessness is to provide permanent supportive housing on a housing-first basis.19 \n9  37.  Despite those experiencing homelessness in Phoenix having nowhere else to \n10  go,  for  years  the  City  has  engaged  in  โclean  sweepsโ  which  target  the  unsheltered \n11  population. \n12  The Cityโs Raids \n13  38.  For at least the past two years, the City has engaged in raids it calls โclean \n14  sweepsโ of areas occupied by unsheltered individuals and those experiencing homelessness. \n15  39.  During these raids, unsheltered individuals (including Plaintiffs and those \n16  served by FFE) are roused from sleep by PPD officers in the early morning hours and told \n17  to pack up their blankets, tents, and all their personal belongings. \n18  40.  Some of these raids occur as early as 3:00 AM. \n19  41.  The City directs the PPD and โclean-upโ crews to remove property. \n20  42.  Unsheltered  individuals  (including  Plaintiffs  and  those  served  by  FFE) \n21  typically have just minutes to gather their personal possessions and belongings before the \n22  raid begins. \n23  43.  Because mere minutes are not enough time to gather and relocate possessions \n24  (particularly for people with disabilities), the inevitable result of the Cityโs raids is that \n25  people permanently lose any property they cannot immediately carry away with them. \n26 \n \n  \n27 \n19 See, e.g., Homelessness Resources: Housing and Shelter, SUBSTANCE ABUSE & \n28  MENTAL HEALTH SERVS. ADMIN., https://www.samhsa.gov/homelessness-programs-\nresources/hpr-resources/housing-shelter (last accessed Nov. 28, 2022). \n \n4860-6678-8680   \n  - 8 - \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02041-GMS   Document 45   Filed 01/13/23   Page 9 of 25\n \n1  44.  Once individuals move from the location where they were sleeping, the PPD \n2  and โclean-upโ crews indiscriminately remove and destroy any remaining items. \n3  45.  Removal is performed with rakes, garbage bags, loaders, and sometimes a \n4  disposal truck. \n5  46.  These raids commonly result in the loss and destruction of personal property \n6  owned by those experiencing homelessness. \n7  47.  Individuals (including Plaintiffs and those served by FFE) also frequently \n8  experience destruction of items difficult to replace such as personal IDs, photographs of \n9  family members and loved ones, and in one case, even a set of teeth.20 \n10  48.  Plaintiffs were never provided notification of when these raids would occur. \n11  49.  Upon information and belief, the purpose of these raids is to discourage \n12  individuals experiencing homelessness from sleeping in the City and to push them to other \n13  surrounding municipalities surrounding Phoenix in the County. \n14  50.  Upon information and belief, the City has used these raids to address the rise \n15  in those experiencing homelessness to divert criticism for failing to adequately provide both \n16  emergency and permanent housing. \n17  51.  It is expected these raids will begin to intensify in a homeless encampment \n18  near 12th Avenue and Madison Street nicknamed โthe Zone.โ This is because of a lawsuit \n19  filed against the City in Arizona State Court. See Brown v. City of Phoenix, CV2022-010439 \n20  (2022) (the โBrown Lawsuitโ). This case was brought by individuals with property in or \n21  around the Zone and alleges Defendants have allowed for the creation of a public nuisance. \n22  The Cityโs Weaponization of Statutes and Ordinances to Criminalize Homelessness \n23  52.  During the Cityโs raids, police often issue mass criminal citations under the \n24  Arizona Revised Statutes and City Ordinances. \n25  53.  The City has cited individuals for violation of Arizona Revised Statute ยง 13-\n26  2906 (the โJaywalking Lawโ), Phoenix City Code ยง 23-30 (the โCamping Banโ), and \n27  Phoenix City Code ยง 23-48.01 (the โSleeping Banโ). \n \n28 \n20 See Blasius, supra note 8. \n \n4860-6678-8680   \n  - 9 - \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02041-GMS   Document 45   Filed 01/13/23   Page 10 of 25\n \n1  54.  The Jaywalking Law prohibits a person from โobstructing a highway or other \n2  public thoroughfare if the personโฆ[h]aving no legal privilege to do so, recklessly interferes \n3  with the passage of any highway or public thoroughfare by creating an unreasonable \n4  inconvenience or hazard.โ Ariz. Rev. Stat. ยง 13-2906(1). \n5  55.  The Jaywalking Law is cited indiscriminately by the City against unsheltered \n6  individuals during raids to discourage basic activities such as sleeping and walking. \n7  56.  The Camping Ban provides: โIt shall be unlawful for any person to camp in \n8  any park or preserve, or in any building, facility, or parking lot or structure, or on any \n9  property adjacent thereto, that is owned, possessed and controlled by the Cityโฆ.โ Phx., \n10  Ariz., CITY CODE ยง 23-30(A). \n11  57.  According to the City, camping means โto use real property of the City for \n12  living accommodation purposes such as sleeping activities, or making preparations to sleep, \n13  including the laying down of bedding for the purpose of sleeping, or storing personal \n14  belongings, or making any fire, or using any tents or shelter or other structure or vehicle for \n15  sleeping or doing any digging or earth breaking or carrying on cooking activities.โ Phx., \n16  Ariz., CITY CODE ยง 23-30(B). \n17  58.  As indicated in the Cityโs definition of the term โcamp,โ the Camping Ban \n18  punishes and criminalizes the act of sleeping by unsheltered individuals within the City. \n19  59.  The  Camping  Ban  is  commonly  cited  by  the  City  against  unsheltered \n20  individuals during raids to discourage basic human activities such as sleeping. \n21  60.  The Sleeping Ban provides: โIt shall be unlawful for any person to use a \n22  public street, highway, alley, lane, parkway, sidewalk or other right-of-way, whether such \n23  right-of-way has been dedicated to the public in fee or by easement, for lying, sleeping or \n24  otherwise remaining in a sitting position thereon, except in the case of a physical emergency \n25  or the administration of medical assistance.โ Phx., Ariz., CITY CODE ยง 23-48.01. \n26  61.  The Sleeping Ban is broad and prohibits sleeping on areas of City property \n27  otherwise unused by pedestrians. \n28 \n \n4860-6678-8680   \n  - 10 - \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02041-GMS   Document 45   Filed 01/13/23   Page 11 of 25\n \n1  62.  The  Sleeping  Ban  is  commonly  cited  by  the  City  against  unsheltered \n2  individuals during raids to discourage universal and unavoidable human activities such as \n3  sleeping. \n4  63.  The  use  of  these  statutes  and  ordinances  by  the  City  are  intended  to \n5  criminalize homelessness. \n6  64.  Despite  neighboring  municipalities  amending  their  policies  and  halting \n7  enforcement of similar ordinances, the City has continued to enforce its unconstitutional \n8  ordinances even when housing and temporary shelter are not practically available to its \n9  homeless residents. \n10  65.  The city of Tempe, for example, admitted enforcement of its camping ban \n11  would be unconstitutional. \n12  66.  The city of Glendale amended its ordinance to prevent imposing criminal \n13  sanctions on camping โwhen no alternative shelter is available.โ Glendale, Ariz., CITY \n14  CODE ยง 25-90. \n15  67.  Meanwhile, Phoenix has continued to enforce its Camping Ban and refused \n16  to amend its Camping Ban or Sleeping Ban. \n17  68.  Upon information and belief, the City cites individuals with violations of \n18  these (and other) statutes/codes to discourage individuals experiencing homelessness from \n19  sleeping in the City and to push them to other surrounding municipalities in the County. \n20  69.  Upon information and belief, the City uses these statutes and ordinances in \n21  place of finding humane solutions for those experiencing homelessness within the City. \n22  Plaintiff Faith Kearnsโ Experience \n23  70.  Ms. Kearns was born and raised in Arizona and attended Washington High \n24  School in the city of Glendale. \n25  71.  Due to various medical issues and the costs associated with medical care, she \n26  has been chronically unsheltered since approximately 2008. \n27  72.  When she is unsheltered, Ms. Kearns sleeps on Phoenix public streets. \n28  73.  Ms. Kearns has also slept in or around the Zone. \n \n4860-6678-8680   \n  - 11 - \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02041-GMS   Document 45   Filed 01/13/23   Page 12 of 25\n \n1  74.  While sleeping within the City as an unsheltered individual, Ms. Kearns has \n2  experienced the raids firsthand. \n3  75.  Ms.  Kearns  describes  these  sweeps  as  โraidsโ  because  they  happened \n4  suddenly and without warning in the early morning hours. \n5  76.  Ms. Kearns remembers the raids sometimes happening three to five days per \n6  week. \n7  77.  Ms. Kearns remembers the raids increasing during and around holidays. \n8  78.  Ms. Kearns was never provided with a search warrant. \n9  79.  During these raids, Ms. Kearns has had personal possessions and belongings \n10  destroyed. \n11  80.  The following was taken from Ms. Kearns by the PPD and City workers \n12  during the raids: an Arizona ID card, a Visa Card on which her social security disability \n13  income was loaded, tent, blankets, bedding, birth certificate, medications, and clothing. \n14  81.  Ms. Kearns remembers being forced to watch the PDD destroy her items. \n15  82.  Ms.  Kearns also remembers receiving  citations from the  City  under the \n16  Jaywalking Law, Camping Ban, and Sleeping Ban. \n17  83.  Ms. Kearns has received other citations related to her unsheltered status such \n18  as a citation for trespassing. \n19  84.  Ms. Kearns believes the Cityโs raids are designed to push her out of the City. \n20  85.  Ms. Kearns believes the Cityโs use of citations is to criminalize her status as \n21  an unsheltered individual. \n22  Plaintiff Frank Urbanโs Experience \n23  86.  Mr. Urban is a resident of Maricopa County and currently resides in Phoenix. \n24  87.  Due to various medical issues, Mr. Urban became chronically unsheltered off \n25  and on starting in 2000. \n26  88.  During the time periods when Mr. Urban has been unsheltered, he has slept \n27  outside in various parts of the City. \n28  89.  During these times, Mr. Urban has directly experienced the Cityโs raids. \n \n4860-6678-8680   \n  - 12 - \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02041-GMS   Document 45   Filed 01/13/23   Page 13 of 25\n \n1  90.  Mr. Urban was never provided with a search warrant. \n2  91.  During these raids, Mr. Urban has had his possessions thrown away numerous \n3  times. \n4  92.  In fact, his possessions have been thrown away so many times, it is difficult \n5  for him to remember dates for each incident as they all โblend together.โ \n6  93.  Nevertheless, Mr. Urban remembers the following being taken from him and \n7  destroyed: an Arizona ID card, tent, blankets, bedding, medications, clothing, food, and \n8  water. \n9  94.  Mr. Urban remembers raids intensifying around Thanksgiving and Christmas. \n10  95.  Mr.  Urban  also  remembers  receiving  citations  from  the  City  under  the \n11  Jaywalking Law, Camping Ban, and Sleeping Ban. \n12  96.  Mr. Urban has received other citations from the City in connection to his \n13  status as unsheltered. \n14  97.  Mr. Urban believes the Cityโs raids are designed to push him out of the City. \n15  98.  Mr. Urban believes the Cityโs use of citations is to criminalize his status as an \n16  unsheltered individual. \n17  Plaintiff Ronnie Massingilleโs Experience \n18  99.  Mr. Massingille is a resident of Maricopa County and currently resides in \n19  Phoenix.  \n20  100.  Mr. Massingille is currently unsheltered.  \n21  101.  Mr.  Massingille  commonly  sleeps  outside  in  various  parts  of  the  City, \n22  including the Zone. \n23  102.  While sleeping and encamped, Mr. Massingille has directly experienced the \n24  Cityโs raids and the actions of PPD.  \n25  103.  Mr. Massingilleโs possessions were seized and thrown away numerous times \n26  during raids.   \n27  104.  He was never provided with a search warrant.  \n28  105.  Mr. Massingille remembers some of these raids occurring in the Zone.  \n \n4860-6678-8680   \n  - 13 - \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02041-GMS   Document 45   Filed 01/13/23   Page 14 of 25\n \n1  106.  During and as a result of these raids, Mr. Massingille recalls losing his \n2  Arizona identification card, birth certificate, tent, a suitcase, clothes/shoes, skateboards, and \n3  medication.  \n4  107.  Mr. Massingille has been cited by the City in connection to his unsheltered \n5  status. \n6  108.  Mr. Massingille believes the Cityโs raids were designed to push him out of \n7  the City.  \n8  109.  Mr. Massingille believes the City uses citations to criminalize his status as an \n9  unsheltered individual.  \n10  110.  As an unsheltered individual in the City, Mr. Massingille lives with a constant \n11  fear PPD will arrest him, criminally cite him for sleeping outside, or destroy his property. \n12  The Fund for Empowermentโs Work on Behalf of the Unsheltered Community \n13  111.  Since 2018, the Fund for Empowerment has spent monetary resources in \n14  support of its mission to help provide education, training, and leadership courses to the \n15  unsheltered community to combat policies and practices by the City which target them. \n16  112.  FFE commonly works within the City, including the Zone. \n17  113.  FFEโs membership includes those who are unsheltered. \n18  114.  FFE commonly creates and prints written materials for dissemination to the \n19  unsheltered community which include information about their rights under the United States \n20  Constitution. \n21  115.  FFE provides training to the unsheltered community about their rights in \n22  response to the raids conducted by the City. \n23  116.  FFE provides training to the unsheltered community about their right to sleep \n24  outside in connection to the Cityโs use of ordinances to criminalize sleeping. \n25  117.  FFE would not have to expend these resources on behalf of its members if the \n26  City stopped conducting raids and using laws and ordinances to criminalize homelessness. \n27  118.  If FFE did not have to expend resources helping unsheltered individuals \n28  understand their rights in response to Defendants raids and criminal citations, FFE could \n \n4860-6678-8680   \n  - 14 - \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02041-GMS   Document 45   Filed 01/13/23   Page 15 of 25\n \n1  spend  resources  training  unsheltered  individuals  to  become  their  own  advocates  in \n2  requesting resources from the City for housing and shelter. \n3  119.  If FFE did not have to expend resources helping unsheltered individuals, FFE \n4  could also distribute more water and food to the unsheltered community during the summer \n5  months. FFE could also provide more supplies to the unsheltered community which would \n6  improve individualsโ quality of life.  \n7  The Cityโs Latest Planned โSweepsโ \n8  120.  On November 15, 2022, the Phoenix New Times reported the City and the \n9  PPD plan to restart their raids/sweeps in the Zone.21 \n10  121.  The City plans to start what it calls โenhanced sweepsโ which will commence \n11  in December 2022. \n12  122.  It is believed these sweeps are the result of the Brown Lawsuit. \n13  123.  During these raids/sweeps, Defendants intend to direct the PPD to block roads \n14  and remove people from their tents and makeshift shelters. \n15  124.  Upon information and belief, the City intends to destroy the property of the \n16  unsheltered community during these sweeps. \n17  125.  Upon information and belief, the Cityโs only reason for performing these \n18  sweeps is in response to the Brown lawsuit brought by Phoenix residents which requests \n19  relief which would violate the constitutional rights of the unsheltered community.22   \n20   \n21   \n22   \n23   \n24 \n \n25  21 See Katya Schwenk, Phoenix Prepares to Restart Controversial Cleanups of Homeless \nEncampment,  PHX.

Plaintiffs re-allege the foregoing paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n7  127.  At all times relevant to the allegations in this Complaint, Defendants acted \n8  under color of state law. \n9  128.  Under the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution, Plaintiffs \n10  have the right to be secure in their persons against unreasonable seizures. \n11  129.  A seizure of property occurs under the Fourth Amendment when there is some \n12  meaningful  interference  with  an  individualโs  possessory  interests  in  that  property; \n13  meaningful interferences include destruction of property. See United States v. Jacobsen, \n14  466 U.S. 109, 113 (1984). \n15  130.  Property includes photographs, identification papers, portable electronics, \n16  and even potentially abandoned property. See Lavan v. City of Los Angeles, 693 F.3d 1022, \n17  1030 (9th Cir. 2012). \n18  131.  Here, Defendants have engaged and will continue to engage in targeted raids \n19  of areas occupied by the unsheltered community. \n20  132.  During  these  raids,  Defendants  unreasonably  seize  and  destroy  property \n21  regardless of its condition, its apparent value, and/or whether or not it has been voluntarily \n22  abandoned. \n23  133.  Plaintiffs Ms. Kearns, Mr. Urban, and Mr. Massingille (and other unsheltered \n24  people who are members of FFE) have experienced destruction of their personal items by \n25  Defendants  including  the  destruction  of  photographs,  identification  papers,  camping \n26  equipment, and other unabandoned personal items within the past two years. \n27  134.  Plaintiffs have seen the destruction of personal items of other unsheltered \n28  individuals including items deemed abandoned by Defendants within the past two years. \n \n4860-6678-8680   \n  - 16 - \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02041-GMS   Document 45   Filed 01/13/23   Page 17 of 25\n \n1  135.  By seizing and destroying Plaintiffsโ property, Defendants meaningfully and \n2  permanently interfered with Plaintiffsโ possessory interest in their property and unlawfully \n3  seized Plaintiffsโ property. \n4  136.  At no time did Defendants provide a warrant to seize Plaintiffsโ property. \n5  137.  Seizures without a warrant are presumptively unconstitutional. \n6  138.  Defendants engage in warrantless seizures of property when no exception to \n7  the warrant requirement applies. \n8  139.  Plaintiffs  have  a  possessory  interest  in  their  property  under  the  Fourth \n9  Amendment. \n10  140.  A reasonable official in Chief Williams and Interim Chief Sullivansโ positions \n11  would have known that seizing and destroying Plaintiffsโ property constitutes a violation of \n12  the Fourth Amendment. \n13  141.  Plaintiffsโ loss of property was the direct and proximate cause of Defendantsโ \n14  seizure and destruction of their property. \n15  142.  The acts of Defendants were intentional and deprived Plaintiffs of their rights, \n16  privileges, liberties, and immunities secured by the Constitution of the United States. \n17  Count Two \n18  (Fourteenth Amendment Violation โ Deprivation of Property without Due Process) \n19  (42 U.S.C. ยง 1983) \n20  (All Defendants) \n21  143.  Plaintiffs re-allege the foregoing paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n22  144.  The Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides that \n23  no state shall โdeprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.โ \n24  145.  Under the Fourteenth Amendment, โthe government may not take property \n25  like a thief in the night; rather, it must announce its intentions and give the property owner \n26  a chance to argue against the taking.โ Clement v. City of Glendale, 518 F.3d 1090, 1093 \n27  (9th Cir. 2008). \n28 \n \n4860-6678-8680   \n  - 17 - \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02041-GMS   Document 45   Filed 01/13/23   Page 18 of 25\n \n1  146.  Violation of city ordinances does not constitute a waiver of due process \n2  interests in a previously recognized property interest. \n3  147.  The property of those experiencing homelessness is โpropertyโ within the \n4  meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment, meaning a government entity โmust comport with \n5  the requirements of the Fourteenth Amendmentโs due process clause if it wishes to take and \n6  destroy them.โ Lavan, 693 F.3d at 1032. \n7  148.  Here, Defendants have engaged and will continue to engage in raids that \n8  targeted the unsheltered community living within the City. \n9  149.  Defendants employed these raids without adequate notice to Plaintiffs. \n10  150.  During  these  raids,  Defendants  seized  and  destroyed  Plaintiffsโ  property \n11  without affording them adequate notice their property would be seized or destroyed. \n12  151.  For Plaintiffs, this property is what they rely on for survival. It is all they have. \n13  Compared with that extremely high interest in their property, any administrative burden on \n14  the City to provide additional process to prevent erroneous deprivation is low. \n15  152.  Plaintiffsโ  property  was  not  seized  in  connection  with  prosecution  or \n16  investigation of any crime. \n17  153.  Defendants destroyed Plaintiffsโ property without affording them a post-\n18  deprivation process for challenging the seizure of their property. \n19  154.  It is clearly  established  Plaintiffs have a right to due process and post-\n20  deprivation hearings when their property is unlawfully seized and destroyed. \n21  155.  A reasonable official in Chief Williams and Interim Chief Sullivansโ positions \n22  would have known that seizing and destroying property without due process of law violates \n23  the Fourteenth Amendment. \n24  156.  As  a  direct  and  proximate  cause  of  Defendantsโ  unconstitutional  acts, \n25  Plaintiffsโ property was seized and destroyed. \n26  157.  The acts of Defendants were intentional and deprived Plaintiffs of their rights, \n27  privileges, liberties, and immunities secured by the Constitution of the United States. \n28   \n \n4860-6678-8680   \n  - 18 - \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02041-GMS   Document 45   Filed 01/13/23   Page 19 of 25\n \n1  Count Three \n2  (Eighth AmendmentโCruel & Unusual Punishment) \n3  (42 U.S.C. ยง 1983) \n4  (All Defendants) \n5  158.  Plaintiffs re-allege the foregoing paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n6  159.  The  Eighth  Amendment  to  the  United  States  Constitution  prohibits  the \n7  government from inflicting cruel and unusual punishment. \n8  160.  The Eighth Amendment โnot only limits the types of punishment that may be \n9  imposed and prohibits the imposition of punishment grossly disproportionate to the severity \n10  of the crime, but also โimposes substantive limits on what can be made criminal and \n11  punished as such.โโ Martin v. City of Boise, 920 F.3d 584, 613 (9th Cir. 2019) (quoting \n12  Ingraham v. Wright, 430 U.S. 651, 667 (1977)). \n13  161.  The Ninth Circuit has made clear that statutes prohibiting sleeping outside \n14  implicate the protections of the Eighth Amendment when applied to homeless individuals. \n15  Martin, 920 F.3d at 615; see also Johnson v. City of Grants Pass, 50 F.4th 787, 808โ812 \n16  (9th Cir. 2022). \n17  162.  Defendant City of Phoenix has enacted ordinances which directly target the \n18  act of sleeping by unsheltered individuals who otherwise have no place to sleep. \n19  163.  Phoenix City Code ยง 23-30(A) makes it unlawful for a person to camp within \n20  the City (the Camping Ban). \n21  164.  Phoenix City Code ยง 23-48.01 makes it unlawful for a person to sleep in any \n22  right of way or sidewalk, even if those places are otherwise unoccupied (the Sleeping Ban). \n23  165.  The City commonly uses the Camping Ban, the Sleeping Ban, and other \n24  statutes against Plaintiffs to criminalize the act of being homeless and engaging in universal \n25  and unavoidable human activities such as sleeping. \n26  166.  Theses statutes and ordinances are enforced by Defendants. \n27  167.  Plaintiffs  have  been  cited  under  numerous  statutes  and  ordinances  by \n28  Defendants for the act of sleeping when they had nowhere else to go. \n \n4860-6678-8680   \n  - 19 - \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02041-GMS   Document 45   Filed 01/13/23   Page 20 of 25\n \n1  168.  Defendants  commonly  cite  individuals  who  are  unsheltered  under  these \n2  statutes and ordinances, as well as others, during their raids (particularly during the raids \n3  conducted outside of the Zone, where there is less public visibility). \n4  169.  By criminalizing basic human activities such as sleeping, Defendants are \n5  knowingly  and  intentionally  violating  the  constitutional  rights  of  the  unsheltered \n6  community. \n7  170.  It is clearly established Plaintiffs cannot constitutionally be punished for \n8  sleeping in public spaces when indoor shelter is not practically available to them. \n9  171.  A reasonable official in Chief Williams and Interim Chief Sullivansโ positions \n10  would have known that enforcing these ordinances and statutes against the unsheltered \n11  population constituted a violation of their Eighth Amendment rights. \n12  172.  As  a  direct  and  proximate  cause  of  Defendantsโ  unconstitutional  acts, \n13  Plaintiffs have been deprived of the basic human right to sleep. \n14  173.  The acts of Defendants were intentional and deprived Plaintiffs of their rights, \n15  privileges, liberties, and immunities secured by the Constitution of the United States. \n16  Count Four \n17  (Municipal Liability under Monell) \n18  (All Defendants) \n19  174.  Plaintiffs re-allege the foregoing paragraphs as if fully set forth herein \n20  175.  Defendants were at all times relevant agents of the City vested with the power \n21  to control and supervise employees, agents, and contractors of the City. \n22  176.  Upon information and belief, Defendants acted in execution of government \n23  policy or custom that may fairly be said to represent the official policy of the City. See \n24  Monell v. Depโt of Soc. Servs. of N.Y., 436 U.S. 658, 694 (1978). \n25  177.  Defendantsโ actions were authorized (before and during the fact) and ratified \n26  (after the fact) by final policymakers for the City. \n27 \n28 \n \n4860-6678-8680   \n  - 20 - \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02041-GMS   Document 45   Filed 01/13/23   Page 21 of 25\n \n1  178.  Defendants directed every action of their agents, thereby causing the violation \n2  of Plaintiffsโ rights, and were deliberately indifferent to the fact that their directives would \n3  result in the violation of Plaintiffsโ rights. \n4  179.  Defendantsโ customs, policies, and/or practices, and the decisions of its final \n5  policymakers  were  the  moving  force  behind  Defendantsโ  violation  of  Plaintiffsโ \n6  constitutional rights. \n7  180.  Defendantsโ actions, as described herein, were motivated by malice and/or \n8  involved reckless or callous indifference to Plaintiffsโ federally protected constitutional \n9  rights. Defendants engaged in these actions and omissions intentionally, willfully, and/or \n10  wantonly, demonstrating deliberate indifference to, and a reckless disregard for, Plaintiffsโ \n11  constitutionally protected rights. \n12  181.  Defendants  have  or  should  have  policies,  procedures,  practices,  and/or \n13  customs to govern the raids to prevent the deprivations that occurred. Instead, of using the \n14  to penalize Plaintiffsโ unsheltered status and destroy Plaintiffsโ valued property. \n15  182.  Upon information and belief, Defendant City of Phoenix and the PPDโs \n16  policies, procedures, practices, and/or customs require agents or employees of the City to \n17  refrain from destroying unsheltered Plaintiffsโ possessions during such raids. \n18  183.  Upon information and belief, Defendants failed to train or supervise their \n19  employees when conducting raids of unsheltered populations such as Plaintiffs, resulting in \n20  the  criminalization  of  the  Plaintiffsโ  unsheltered  status  and  destruction  of  Plaintiffsโ \n21  property. \n22  184.  As a direct and proximate result of Defendantsโ acts or omissions pursuant to \n23  official  government  policy,  Plaintiffs  suffered  (without  limitation)  a  deprivation  of \n24  constitutional rights. \n25  Count Five \n26  (Fourteenth AmendmentโState Created Danger) \n27  (All Defendants)  \n28  185.  Plaintiffs re-allege the foregoing paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n \n4860-6678-8680   \n  - 21 - \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02041-GMS   Document 45   Filed 01/13/23   Page 22 of 25\n \n1  186.  The due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States \n2  Constitution  prevents  Defendants  from  placing  Plaintiffs  Ms.  Kearn,  Mr.  Urban,  Mr. \n3  Massingille (and other unsheltered people served by Plaintiff FFE) in danger by acting with \n4  deliberate indifference to a known and obvious danger. \n5  187.  The Zone in downtown Phoenix occupies an area of concrete, asphalt, and \n6  rocks unprotected from the sun. \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16  188.  It extends nearly two blocks (approximately 500 feet). \n17  189.  During the summer, temperatures in this area can reach as high as 118ยบF. \n18  190.  Because  it is generally unprotected from the heat and  sun, hundreds of \n19  unsheltered individuals die from heat related exposure every summer in the Zone.23 \n20  191.  Defendants explicitly and implicitly send unsheltered individuals residing and \n21  living in the City into the Zone. \n22  192.  Defendants relax raids and enforcement of the Sleeping Ban in the Zone in \n23  order to encourage individuals to stay in the Zone. \n24  193.  Defendants actively transport unsheltered individuals into the Zone. \n25  194.  Defendants tell unsheltered individuals to go to the Zone. \n26 \n \n27 \n23 See Anita Snow, Sweltering streets: Hundreds of homeless die in extreme heat across \nUS, FOX 10 PHX. (June 20, 2022), https://www.fox10phoenix.com/news/sweltering-\n28 \nstreets-hundreds-homeless-die-extreme-heat. \n \n4860-6678-8680   \n  - 22 - \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02041-GMS   Document 45   Filed 01/13/23   Page 23 of 25\n \n1  195.  Defendants have told both Plaintiffs Mr. Urban and Ms. Kearns to go to the \n2  Zone during encounters. \n3  196.  Defendants  push  people  into  the  Zone  despite  knowing  the  Zone  is \n4  unprotected from heat-related danger. \n5  197.  Defendants know about the increased heat related deaths in the Zone yet have \n6  done nothing to protect or provide any kind of shelter or shade to individuals in the Zone. \n7  198.  Because Defendants actively send unsheltered individuals residing and living \n8  in the City into the Zone all year-round, it is over-crowded. \n9  199.  Due to the over-crowding of unsheltered individuals being forced to live in a \n10  small, defined place, the risk of contracting infectious diseases is heightened.24 \n11  200.  As a direct and proximate result of Defendantsโ actions, Plaintiffs (and those \n12  they serve) have been subjected to a heightened risk of harm that severely threatens their \n13  bodily security. \n14  201.  As a direct and proximate result of Defendantsโ actions, Plaintiffs (and those \n15  they serve) have been subjected bodily harm including infections and heat stroke. \n16  202.  As a direct and proximate result of Defendantsโ actions, Plaintiffs have \n17  suffered a deprivation of their constitutional rights. \n18   \n19  PRAYER FOR RELIEF \n20  WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs pray for judgment against Defendants as follows: \n21  A.

Enjoining Defendants from conducting raids and taking other actions that \n21  cause  the  displacement  of  those  experiencing  homelessness  unless \n22  individual housing options are available to shelter these individuals;  \n23  e.  Requiring Defendants to provide advance notice of their intent to conduct \n24  raids; and, \n25  f.  Requiring Defendants to provide shade and other resources to individuals \n26  in the Zone to address heat-related deaths in this area. \n27  C.

R.  Civ.  P.  24(a).  In  the \n  \nalternative,  Proposed  Intervenors  seek  permissive  intervention  pursuant  to  Rule  24(b). \nA\nN\nA\nYD\nThe  grounds  for  this  motion  are  as  follows: \n  \nNN\nNo\nCase  2:22-cv-02041-GMS  Document  76  Filed  05/23/23  Page  2  of  4 \n1.  Proposed  Intervenors  are  the  plaintiffs  in  the  ongoing  case  Brown  v.  City  of \n \nt  Phoenix,  No.  CV2022-010439  (Maricopa  County  Super.  Ct.,  filed  Aug.  10,  2022).  In  that \nN\nk\n  case,  they  are  suing  the  City  of  Phoenix  for  maintaining  a  public  nuisance  by  operating, \nB\nWt\noverseeing,  and  maintaining  the  homeless  encampment  known  as  the  Zone,  which  is  also \ne\nu the  subject  of this  action.  Proposed Intervenors  own property  and  operate  businesses  in  the \nn\nZone,  and  are  harmed  by  the  Cityโs  maintenance  of this  public  nuisance.  In  its  defense  in \nthat  case,  the  City  contends,  in  part,  that  it  is  prohibited  by  Martin  v.  City  of Boise,  920 \n \nt\nn\nF.3d  584  (9th  Cir.  2019), from  taking  certain  steps  necessary  to  abate  such  a  nuisance.  The \nm\n oOo Proposed  Intervenors  deny  that. \n2. The  Maricopa County  Superior Court in Brown  has issued  an injunction requiring \n Se OC\nthe  City  to  take  appropriate  steps  before  July  10,  2023,  to  abate  the  public  nuisance  it  has \n FK FK\ncreated  in  the  Zone  by  transporting  unsheltered  persons  to  the  Zone,  refusing  to  enforce \n FK NY\n  laws  such  as  those  against  public  urination,  defecation,  and  public  camping,  and  by \n FKwW\n PF FF allowing  encampments  and  obstructions  on  the  Cityโs  property  in  the  Zone. \n      \n3.  The  Plaintiffs  in  this  lawsuit  contend  that  it  is  unconstitutional  for  the  City  of \n FK \nU\n PFD Phoenix  to  enforce  anti-camping  ordinances  in  the  Zone.  On  December  15,  2022,  this \nCourt  issued  a  preliminary  injunction  that  effectively  restated  the  holding  of  Martin  and \n FK \nN\nA that  limited  the  Cityโs  ability to  enforce  legal  prohibitions  against camping  and/or  sleeping \n YFH\n D on  public  property  and  that  separately  limited  the  Cityโs  authority  to  seize  and/or  destroy \n YF0\n  property  in  the  Zone.  The  Plaintiffs  have  now  filed  an  Order  to  Show  Cause  seeking  a \n NDO\nY\nfinding  of civil  contempt  against  the  City  for  allegedly  violating  that  injunction. \n NY FK   \n  3.  Intervention  as  of right  is  warranted  under  Rule  24(a)(2)  because  (1)  this  action \n NV\nN\n W is  timely;  (2)  the  Proposed  Intervenors  have  a  substantial  interest  in  the  subject  of this  suit \nY\nN\n YN FF because  an  order  forbidding  the  City  from  taking  actions  that  could  help  the  abatement  of \nthe  nuisance  at  issue  in  Brown  will  result  in  the  continuance  of  that  nuisance  and  the \n YN \nu\nn continuing  harms  to  the  Proposed  Intervenorsโ  property  rights,  economic  interests, \n YN\n Y  personal  safety,  and  other  interests  involved  in  the  Brown  case;  (3)  the  disposition  of this \nNt\nn\n  action  will,  as  a  practical  matter,  impair  and  impede  the  Proposed  Intervenorsโ  ability  to \nvo\nN\n-2- \nCase  2:22-cv-02041-GMS  Document  76  Filed  05/23/23  Page  3  of  4 \nprotect  those  interests;  and  (4)  the  Proposed  Intervenorโs  interests  are  not  adequately \nrepresented  by  the  existing  Defendants,  who  are  also  defendants  in  the  Brown  case  and \n YN\nwhose  interests  may  not  be  fully  adverse  to  the  Plaintiffsโ  interests  in  this  matter. \n \nW\n FF 4.  In  the  alternative,  Proposed  Intervenors  should  be  permitted  to  intervene  under \nRule  24(b)(1)  because  they  seek  to  address  some  common  legal  questions  of  whether \n Hn\nMartin  indeed bars  the  City  from taking  steps  necessary  to  abate  the  nuisance  it  is  currently \n DK\nmaintaining  in  the  Zone. \n \nn\nO This  motion  is  based  on this  Notice  of Motion  and Motion, the  simultaneously  filed \n O Memorandum  of Points  and  Authorities, the  files  and  records  of this  action, and other such \no\nargument  or  evidence  as  may  be  presented  if the  Court  wishes  to  convene  a hearing. \nCO \neB KF \nRESPECTFULLY  SUBMITTED  this  23rd  day  of May,  2023. \neB  \nN\nBe W\nTULLY  BAILEY  LLP \n FF \ne     \n/s/  Stephen  W.

In her report, the special master found \nthat, by virtue of their organizational functions, plaintiffs CPCS and HCLJ have proper representative standing for \npersons (including criminal defendants) whose rights are implicated by the issues underlying the petition. See \nPlanned Parenthood League of Mass., Inc. v. Bell, 424 Mass. 573, 578, 677 N.E.2d 204, cert. denied, 522 U.S. 819, \n118 S.Ct. 72, 139 L.Ed.2d 32 (1997). See also Committee for Pub.

We agree.

In the first category, \njudges discredited the testimony of officers from the department in granting a defendantโs motion to suppress. In \nthe second category, officers who had served as prosecution witnesses either testified about their prior dishonest \nconduct or were later indicted for their misconduct. \n19 \n \n\nGraham v. District Attorney for Hampden District, 493 Mass. 348 (2024)   \n225 N.E.3d 245 \n \n \n7  Following Giglio, the DOJ promulgated a โPolicy Regarding the Disclosure to Prosecutors of Potential Impeachment \n  Information Concerning Law Enforcement Agency Witnessesโ (also known as the โGiglio Policyโ) to better effect \ndisclosure. Matter of a Grand Jury Investigation, 485 Mass. at 658, 152 N.E.3d 65. \n \n8  The case of plaintiff Graham offers an example of the exculpatory materials that may be contained within police \n  department internal affairs records. In July 2017, Graham, a Black man, was in an altercation with two white \noff-duty officers. One of the three men pointed a gun during this altercation, but it was unclear who did so, Graham \nor one of the officers. When on-duty officers from the department arrived at the scene, Graham was arrested for, \namong other things, unlawful possession of a loaded firearm. However, during the altercation, an unidentified 911 \ncaller stated that the Black man involved did not have the gun. After Graham filed a complaint against the arresting \nofficers for assault, the internal investigations unit followed up with the 911 caller, who reiterated that the only \nperson  with  a  gun  was  a  โwhite  guy.โ  Accordingly,  the  special  master  later  deemed  the  911  call  โclearly \nexculpatory.โ The prosecutor was unaware of the internal investigations unitโs investigation, and defense counsel \ndid not obtain the report of that investigation. Therefore, Graham was convicted without knowledge of this call and \nonly obtained access to the internal investigation unitโs file through the efforts of his appellate counsel. \n \n9  The case of plaintiff Lopez provides an example of the plaintiffsโ efforts to obtain the documents from the \n  department that underlie the DOJ report. Lopez was a defendant in two criminal cases in Hampden County. After \nthe publication of the DOJ report in July 2020, Lopezโs CPCS defense attorney undertook efforts to determine \nwhether the officers in Lopezโs case were implicated by the DOJ report. These efforts continued over the course of \napproximately eighteen months. In January 2022, the district attorneyโs office sent over 1,000 pages of files from \nthe departmentโs internal investigations unit to Lopezโs defense counsel. In March 2022, while his defense counsel \nwas combing through these documents, Lopez pleaded guilty. \n \n1  For instance, a finding that an officer was not wearing his prescription glasses at the time he made an observation. \n \n \n2  In light of the centrality of an investigating police officerโs credibility to effectively prosecuting a crime, an officerโs \n  credibility is often directly linked to his or her capacity to perform essential investigatory functions. When a given \nofficerโs credibility is compromised, so too may the broader aims of past and present investigations linked to that \nofficer be compromised. Accordingly, police departments, to ensure the integrity of their cases, may elect not to use \nofficers with adverse credibility determinations in investigations moving forward. When an adverse credibility \ndetermination is based on a finding other than that a police officer lied, such intense consequences unjustifiably \ndeprive an officer of his or her capacity to continue serving the public honestly, which in turn deprives the public of \nits interest in justice. \n \n \n \n \nEnd of Document \n \n \n20 \n \n\nGraham v.

For the reasons \n18  below, the motion is granted in part and denied in part.  However, nothing in this Order \n19  precludes the City from conducting its enhanced cleanup plans in the area known as โthe \n20  Zone,โ as outlined in its procedures and the briefings in this case.   \n21  BACKGROUND \n22  Plaintiff Fund for the Empowerment (โFFEโ) is an incorporated nonprofit charity \n23  operating in Maricopa County that provides advocacy, programming, and resources to the \n24  countyโs unsheltered population.  Plaintiffs Faith Kearns and Frank Urban are chronically \n25  unsheltered individuals who reside in Maricopa County.  Together, Plaintiffs have filed \n26  this action against the City of Phoenix; Chief Jeri Williams, the Chief of the Phoenix Police \n27  Department, in her official capacity; Interim Chief of the Phoenix Police Department, \n28  Michael Sullivan, in his official capacity; Entities I-X, political subdivisions of the state of \n \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-02041-GMS   Document 34   Filed 12/16/22   Page 2 of 19\n \n \n \n1  Arizona; and Officers John and Jane Does 1โ75, in their individual capacities.  The claims \n2  in Plaintiffsโ Motion for Preliminary Injunction (Doc. 2) assert violations of their Fourth, \n3  Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights.  \n4  Plaintiffsโ  Fourth  and  Fourteenth  Amendment  claims  arise  from  Defendantsโ \n5  practice, which allegedly targets unsheltered individuals in Phoenix and results in the \n6  indiscriminate destruction of their property.  In the challenged practice, City police and/or \n7  other personnel approach unsheltered individuals and perform warrant checks, while city \n8  employees prepare to clear out any property from the area.  Unsheltered individuals like \n9  Ms. Kearns and Mr. Urban then have a limited amount of time to collect their personal \n10  belongings.  Any items they cannot collect in time are allegedly destroyed.  Ms. Kearns \n11  and Mr. Urban claim that they were personally been subjected to this practice on multiple \n12  occasions from 2019 to 2020.  On some occasions, Ms. Kearns and Mr. Urban claim that \n13  the Phoenix Police Department has โinexplicably confiscate[d] and destroy[ed] . . . their[] \n14  Arizona IDs, bank cards, tents, blankets and bedding, medications, clothing, and even a \n15  birth certificate.โ  (Doc. 2 at 3.)  Plaintiffs also provide witness statements demonstrating \n16  more recent instances of the practice; one witness states he saw Phoenix police engage in \n17  the conduct at issue as recently as December 7, 2022.  (Doc. 26 at 2.)  Plaintiffs claim that \n18  these practices occur throughout the City of Phoenix.          \n19  The Cityโs practices were a primary source of discussion at the Preliminary Hearing \n20  conducted on December 14, 2022.1  Plaintiffs filed their Motion for Preliminary Injunction \n21  in part because the City plans to conduct an โenhanced cleaningโ of the area known as โthe \n22  Zoneโ on December 16, 2022.  The Zone is a homeless encampment located near 12th \n23  Avenue and Madison which, at its largest, held over a thousand unsheltered residents.  \n24  (Doc. 2 at 5.) At the Hearing, Phoenixโs Director of the Office of Homeless Solutions, \n25  Rachel Milne, testified to the Cityโs plan for conducting enhanced cleanings in the Zone.  \n26 \n \n1 Because significant portions of the testimony at the preliminary injunction hearing were \n27 \nnot represented in the briefings, the Court discusses testimony elicited at the hearing \nfrequently throughout this Order.  In doing so, it references the unofficial transcript \n28 \nproduced by the Court Reporter at the hearing.  At the time of issuing this Order, however, \nno official transcript has been requested or made.   \n \n- 2 - \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-02041-GMS   Document 34   Filed 12/16/22   Page 3 of 19\n \n \n \n1  Ms. Milne said that pursuant to its plan, the City provided occupants of the Zone two \n2  weeksโ  notice  of  the  cleaning  via  flyers  and  planned  to  offer  support  services  for \n3  individuals to move their belongings ahead of the cleaning.  The Cityโs enhanced cleaning \n4  plan also includes an abandoned property procedure, which requires the City to tag items \n5  left in the Zone during the enhanced cleanings and leave them in place for seven days.  If \n6  the property is not claimed after seven days, the City may remove the property and maintain \n7  it for at least 30 days in a secure location for retrieval.  (Doc. 18-1 at 6.)   \n8  However, in their Motion for Preliminary Injunction, Plaintiffs also challenged \n9  Defendantsโ practices throughout the City.  The City explained that the enhanced cleaning \n10  plan and the abandoned property procedure apply exclusively to cleanings conducted \n11  within the Zone.  Defendants offered the testimony of the Cityโs Director of the Office of \n12  Homeless Solutions, Scott Hall, on this point.  According to Mr. Hall, outside of the \n13  enhanced cleaning procedures to be used in the Zone, the City does not have: a policy for \n14  determining whether unsheltered personsโ property is abandoned, a time period for which \n15  it holds any class of unsheltered personsโ property after it is seized, or a policy for notifying \n16  individuals that their property has been seized.  Mr. Hall testified that shortly after the City \n17  has seized the unsheltered personโs property, the City destroys the property.  However, Mr. \n18  Hall also stated that when the City seizes identifying documents or materials, it attempts to \n19  contact  the  individuals.  If,  however,  the  City  cannot  contact  them,  it  destroys  the \n20  documents or materials.  Mr. Hall did not know long the City would hold these documents \n21  before  destroying  them.    Plaintiffsโ  Fourth  and  Fourteenth  Amendment  claims  thus \n22  challenge the Cityโs practices outside of the Zone and the Cityโs new written procedures \n23  for cleanings inside the Zone.  \n24  Plaintiffsโ Eighth Amendment claims involve two city ordinances, Phoenix City \n25  Code  Section  23-30(A)  (โCamping  Banโ)  and  Phoenix  City  Code  Section  23-48.01 \n26  (โSleeping Banโ) that criminalize camping and sleeping outside.  In relevant part, the \n27  Camping Ban states, โ[i]t shall be unlawful for any person to camp in any park or preserve, \n28  or in any building, facility, or parking lot or structure, or on any property adjacent thereto, \n \n- 3 - \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-02041-GMS   Document 34   Filed 12/16/22   Page 4 of 19\n \n \n \n1  that is owned, possessed and controlled by the City.โ Phoenix City Code Section 23-30(A).   \n2  According to the City, camping is defined as using:   \n3  real property of the City for living accommodation purposes such as \nsleeping activities, or making preparations to sleep, including the \n4 \nlaying  down  of  bedding  for  the  purpose  of  sleeping,  or  storing \n5  personal belongings, or making any fire, or using any tents or shelter \nor other structure or vehicle for sleeping or doing any digging or earth \n6 \nbreaking or carrying on cooking activities.                                           \n7 \nId. ยง 23-30(B). \n8  Likewise, the relevant portion of the Sleeping Ban states, โ[i]t shall be unlawful for \n9  any  person  to  use  a  public  street,  highway,  alley,  lane,  parkway,  sidewalk  or  other \n10  right-of-way, whether such right-of-way has been dedicated to the public in fee or by \n11  easement, for lying, sleeping or otherwise remaining in a sitting position thereon.โ  Phoenix \n12  City Code Section 23-48.01.  Defendants allegedly rely on these statutes to cite unsheltered \n13  individuals, move them into the Zone, and destroy their property, which according to \n14  Plaintiffs, โactively criminalize[s] homelessness.โ  (Doc. 2 at 3.) \n15 \nDISCUSSION \n16 \nI.  Legal Standard \n17 \nWhen seeking a preliminary injunction, plaintiffs must establish that: (1) they are \n18 \nlikely to succeed on the merits of their claims, (2) they will suffer irreparable harm in the \n19 \nabsence of preliminary relief, (3) the balance of equities tips supports a preliminary \n20 \ninjunction, and (4) an injunction is in the public interest.  Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, \n21 \nInc., 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008).  The Ninth Circuit applies a โsliding scaleโ or โserious \n22 \nquestionsโ approach to the Winter factors.  Thus, โserious questions going to the merits \n23 \nand a balance of hardships that tips sharply towards the plaintiff can support issuance of a \n24 \npreliminary injunction, so long as the plaintiff also shows that there is a likelihood of \n25 \nirreparable injury and that the injunction is in the public interest.โ  All. for the Wild Rockies \n26 \nv. Cottrell, 632 F.3d 1127, 1135 (9th Cir. 2011). \n27 \nII.  Winter Factors  \n28 \nA. Likelihood of Success on the Merits  \n \n- 4 - \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-02041-GMS   Document 34   Filed 12/16/22   Page 5 of 19\n \n \n \n1  1.  Eighth Amendment Claims \n2  The Eighth Amendment prohibits the government from inflicting โcruel and unusual \n3  punishments,โ and places โsubstantive limits on what can be made criminal and punished \n4  as such.โ  U.S. Const. amend. VIII; Ingraham v. Wright, 430 U.S. 651, 667 (1977) (cleaned \n5  up).  The Ninth Circuit has interpreted these substantive limits in a way that suggests \n6  Plaintiffs are highly likely to succeed on the merits of their Eighth Amendment claims.  In \n7  Martin v. City of Boise, the City of Boise, like the City of Phoenix, โ[had] a significant and \n8  increasing homeless populationโ and lacked sufficient shelter space to accommodate a \n9  substantial portion of its unsheltered population.  920 F.3d 584, 604 (9th Cir. 2019).  And, \n10  the Martin plaintiffs, like FFEโs constituents, were unsheltered individuals who received \n11  citations under two Boise city ordinances.  Id. at 606.  The first, Boise City Code ยง 9-10-02, \n12  made it a misdemeanor to use โany of the streets, sidewalks, parks, or public places as a \n13  camping place at any time.โ Cf. Phoenix City Code Section 23-30(A) (โIt shall be unlawful \n14  for any person to camp in any park or preserve, or in any building, facility, or parking lot \n15  or structure, or on any [City] property.โ).  The ordinance defined โcampingโ as โthe use of \n16  public property as a temporary or permanent place of dwelling, lodging, or residence.โ Id.; \n17  cf. Phoenix City Code Section 23-30(B) (defining camping as using the Cityโs real property \n18  โfor living accommodation purposes such as sleeping activities, or making preparations to \n19  sleep, including the laying down of bedding for the purpose of sleeping, or storing personal \n20  belongingsโ).  The second ordinance, Boise City Code ยง 6-01-05, banned โ[o]ccupying, \n21  lodging, or sleeping in any building, structure, or public place, whether public or private . . . \n22  without the permission of the owner or person entitled to possession or in control thereof.โ \n23  Cf. Phoenix City Code Section 23-48.01 (โIt shall be unlawful for any person to use a \n24  public street, highway, alley, lane, parkway, sidewalk or other right-of-way . . . for lying, \n25  sleeping or otherwise remaining in a sitting position thereon.โ).   \n26  In invalidating these ordinances, the Martin Court determined that various Supreme \n27  Court precedent stood for the principle โthat the Eighth Amendment prohibits the state \n28  from punishing an involuntary act or condition if it is the unavoidable consequence of oneโs \n \n- 5 - \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-02041-GMS   Document 34   Filed 12/16/22   Page 6 of 19\n \n \n \n1  status or being.โ  Martin, 920 F.3d at 616 (citing Jones v. City of Los Angeles, 444 F.3d \n2  1118, 1134โ35 (9th Cir. 2006), vacated, 505 F.3d 1006 (9th Cir. 2007)).  Thus, it followed \n3  that โthe Eighth Amendment prohibits the imposition of criminal penalties for sitting, \n4  sleeping, or lying outside on public property for homeless individuals who cannot obtain \n5  shelterโ because no matter how โsitting, lying, and sleepingโ were defined โthey are \n6  universal and unavoidable consequences of being human.โ   Id. at 616โ17.  โAs a result, \n7  just as the state [could] not criminalize the state of being โhomeless in public places,โโ it \n8  could not โcriminalize conduct that is an unavoidable consequence of being homeless.โ  Id. \n9  at 617.  However, the court also noted that its holding was a limited one; it โin no way \n10  dictate[d] to the City that it must provide sufficient shelter for the homeless, or allow \n11  anyone who wishes to sit, lie, or sleep on the streets . . . at any time and at any place.โ  Id.   \n12  Instead, it held โonly that so long as there is a greater number of homeless individuals in a \n13  jurisdiction than the number of available beds in shelters, the jurisdiction cannot prosecute \n14  homeless individuals for involuntarily sitting, lying, and sleeping in public.โ  Id. (internal \n15  punctuation omitted).   \n16  Here, the Cityโs ordinances are essentially identical to the ordinances at issue in \n17  Martin.  Despite an unsheltered population exceeding 3,000 residents, Phoenix only has \n18  approximately 1,788 shelter beds available for those experiencing homelessness.  (Doc. 2 \n19  at 3.)  Thus, under Martin, any enforcement of the Camping and Sleeping Bans against \n20  individuals  who  practically  cannot  obtain  shelter  is  inconsistent  with  the  Eighth \n21  Amendment because such ordinances effectively criminalize conduct that is a consequence \n22  of being homeless.     \n23  However, Martin did not address who bore the burden of establishing whether \n24  violations of sleeping and camping bans were voluntary.  But, in Johnson v. City of Grants \n25  Pass, 50 F.4th 787 (9th Cir. 2022), an analogous case, the Ninth Circuit recently noted that \n26  โMartin  did  not  hold  homeless  persons  bear  the  burden  of  demonstrating  they  are \n27  involuntarily homeless.โ  Id. at 811 n. 31.  Nevertheless, the majority expressly denied that \n28  it โshifted the burden to the City to establish the voluntariness of the behavior targeted by \n \n- 6 - \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-02041-GMS   Document 34   Filed 12/16/22   Page 7 of 19\n \n \n \n1  the ordinances.โ  Id. at 812 n. 32.  In this case, however, where the ordinances provide a \n2  criminal  sanction,  the  City  has  appropriately  conceded  that  it  bears  the  burden  of \n3  confirming that shelter space is not practically available to an individual before charging \n4  that person with violating either of the above ordinances.   (Doc. 18 at 11 (โPrior to any \n5  criminal  enforcement,  officers  must  investigate  the  individualโs  circumstances  and \n6  determine if there is shelter space available.โ).)  Additionally, it is not contested that there \n7  are more unsheltered individuals than shelter beds in Phoenix.   \n8  Under such circumstances, the City bears the burden of enforcing its ordinances \n9  against only those who can practically obtain shelter.  Still, the City contends that its \n10  concession that officers must make individualized assessments before citing individuals \n11  under the ordinances precludes the need for a broad injunction.  Nevertheless, the Camping \n12  and Sleeping Bans remain unchanged since Martin.  As the City also concedes, both of the \n13  ordinances, while not facially unconstitutional, present likely unconstitutional applications \n14  especially when the unsheltered in the city outnumber the available bed spaces.  Further, \n15  because the problematic ordinances remain unamended, the Cityโs position is โa statement \n16  of administrative policy and so could be amended or reversed at any time by the [Phoenix] \n17  Chief of Policeโ or other officials.  Martin, 920 F.3d at 607.  Thus, it does not forestall the \n18  Plaintiffsโ ultimate likelihood of success on the merits.  An injunction will therefore issue \n19  barring the City from enforcing the Camping and Sleeping Bans against persons with no \n20  practical recourse to housing.2  \n21  2.  Fourteenth Amendment Claims \n22  Plaintiffs also demonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits of their Fourteenth \n23  Amendment claims regarding the Cityโs activity outside the scope of the enhanced cleanup \n24  plan.  The Fourteenth Amendment provides that โ[n]o state shall . . . deprive any person of \n25  life,  liberty,  or  property  without  due  process  of  laws.โ    U.S.  Const.  amend.  XIV. \n26  โApplication of this prohibition requires the familiar two-stage analysis: We must first ask \n \n27 \n2 The Court has considered the Brief in Opposition of Plaintiffs' Request for Preliminary \nInjunction by Amicus Freddy Brown (Doc. 33).  Although the Court permitted the Clerk \n28 \nof  Court  to  file  the  Brief,  it  did  not  affect  the  disposition  of  Plaintiffsโ  Motion  for \nPreliminary Injunction. \n \n- 7 - \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-02041-GMS   Document 34   Filed 12/16/22   Page 8 of 19\n \n \n \n1  whether  the  asserted  individual  interests  are  encompassed  within  the  Fourteenth \n2  Amendmentโs protection of โlife, liberty or propertyโ; if protected interests are implicated, \n3  we then must decide what procedures constitute โdue process of law.โโ  Ingraham, 430 \n4  U.S. at 672.    \n5  In  Lavan  v.  City  of  Los  Angeles,  the  Ninth  Circuit  held  that  the  Fourteenth \n6  Amendment protected the unabandoned property of unsheltered individuals.  693 F.3d \n7  1022, 1031โ32 (9th Cir. 2012).  The Court upheld the district courtโs injunction, which \n8  prohibited the taking of any property in โSkid Row absent an objectively reasonable belief \n9  that it is abandoned, presents and immediate threat to public health or safety, or is evidence \n10  of a crime, or contraband,โ and required that after the taking of such property, the City \n11  maintain it in a secure location for at least 90 days.  Lavan, 797 F. Supp. 2d at 1020.  The \n12  Ninth Circuit declined to carve out an exception for unsheltered personsโ unattended \n13  property or property left in public in violation of local ordinances.  693 F.3d at 1031โ32.  \n14  In this case, the City does not appear to challenge that unsheltered personsโ possessions are \n15  โpropertyโ within the ambit of the Fourteenth Amendment.  The City accepts that the \n16  unabandoned property of unsheltered individuals is subject to the Fourteenth Amendment \n17  due process requirements.3  โAs such, before the city can seize and destroy Plaintiffsโ \n18  property, it must provide notice and an โopportunity to be heard at a meaningful time and \n19  in  a  meaningful  manner,โ  except  in  โextraordinary  situations  where  some  valid \n20  governmental interest is at stake that justifies the postponing of the hearing until after the \n21  event.โโ  Lavan, 797 F. Supp. 2d at 1016โ17.   \n22  To succeed on the merits then, Plaintiffs must demonstrate that: (1) the City seized \n23  their property; (2) the City did so absent basic procedural due process requirements such \n24  as notice and an opportunity to be heard; and (3) the taking was conducted pursuant to a \n25  government policy or custom that may be fairly said to represent the official policy of the \n26  City, Monell v. Depโt of Social Servs. Of City of New York, 436 U.S. 658, 695 (1978).    \n27  Plaintiffs state in their affidavits that on numerous occasions their property has been \n \n28 \n3 The City explained at the preliminary injunction hearing that it recognized Lavan requires \nnotice and procedural safeguards against property loss.   \n \n- 8 - \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-02041-GMS   Document 34   Filed 12/16/22   Page 9 of 19\n \n \n \n1  taken and destroyed by City personnel, and they were provided no opportunity to retrieve \n2  it.  More specifically, Plaintiffs state that they have had the following items taken and/or \n3  destroyed by Phoenix police: an Arizona ID card, a Visa card, tents, blankets and bedding, \n4  birth certificates, medications, and clothing.  (Doc. 2-1 at 3-4, 7.)  Most, if not all, of these \n5  incidents occurred outside the Zone.  (Doc. 2-1 at 3, 7.)  In response, at the preliminary \n6  injunction hearing, the City explained its practices related to unsheltered personsโ property \n7  outside  the Zone.  In light of the Plaintiffsโ testimony, the Cityโs explanation of its practices \n8  shows that there is a likelihood that the City has taken Plaintiffsโ property without notice \n9  and an opportunity to be heard, as required by the Fourteenth Amendment.      \n10  First, it is not clear that the City provides notice to individuals before seizing their \n11  property.  At the preliminary injunction hearing, the City represented that when it receives \n12  a call regarding an unsheltered  individual  or their property,  it is routed through  the \n13  โCARESโ process, which is an interdepartmental process that handles issues related to \n14  homelessness.  Next, a member of the neighborhood outreach team is sent to assess the \n15  property and situation.  If an individual is not present the team member leaves a flyer on \n16  the property, indicating that the team was called and attempting to connect the individual \n17  with the proper resources.  Importantly, the flyer does not inform the individual that if they \n18  do not respond to the notice or fail to remove their property, it will be taken.  Nevertheless, \n19  at an unspecified time, if the team does not hear from the individual, either police or other \n20  City personnel returns to the propertyโs location, and if it is unattended, the property is \n21  seized.  If the property provides some method of identifying the owner, the City uses that \n22  identification to attempt to find the owner.  But otherwise, as a general rule, when the \n23  property is seized, it is not held but destroyed.   \n24  The City appears to allege that because this process involves attempts to reach the \n25  individual, it complies with the Fourteenth Amendmentโs notice requirements.  Attempting \n26  to contact an individual about services available to them is not the same as informing the \n27  individual that if her property is left unattended, it will be seized and destroyed.  The \n28  Fourteenth Amendment, at a bare minimum, requires the latter.  In Lavan, the district court \n \n- 9 - \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-02041-GMS   Document 34   Filed 12/16/22   Page 10 of 19\n \n \n \n1  indicated that notices of forthcoming cleanups that were posted on street signs โat a very \n2  high level with small print, obscured by foliage or taped over,โ were inadequate to provide \n3  notice that property would be taken if left unattended.  797 F. Supp. 2d at 1017.  In this \n4  case, a notice that the CARES team was called and is attempting to connect the individual \n5  to services is similarly unlikely to constitute adequate notice that the personโs property is \n6  likely to be seized or destroyed.   \n7  Additionally, even if the Cityโs practices constituted adequate notice, it conceded \n8  that it does not provide individuals with an opportunity to be heard after their property is \n9  taken.  The City acknowledged that outside the scope of the enhanced cleanup plan that it \n10  intends to execute in the Zone, unsheltered individuals are not afforded an opportunity to \n11  retrieve their seized property, and often, it is destroyed.  Even a small window of time to \n12  retrieve oneโs property may be insufficient.  Lavan, 797 F. Supp. 2d at 1017 (rejecting the \n13  notion that 72 hours to retrieve oneโs property at the dump is sufficient opportunity to be \n14  heard).  Here, there is, apparently, no time at all; and even if there was, such a time period \n15  does not appear to be communicated to unsheltered persons before, during, or after the \n16  taking of their property.   \n17  The City relies on several cases addressing whether Plaintiffs are likely to succeed \n18  on  the  merits  of  similar  claims  in  light  of  facially  constitutional  standard  operating \n19  procedures.  See, e.g., Shipp v. Shaaf, 379 F. Supp. 3d 1033 (N.D. Cal. 2019); Murray v. \n20  City of Philadelphia, 481 F. Supp. 3d 461 (E.D. Pa. 2020).  These cases are not applicable, \n21  however, where the City does not offer any consistent policy for how it determines whether \n22  an item is abandoned, and where, once the item is seized, it is destroyed without notice.  \n23  To be clear, the Fourteenth Amendment violation is not the absence of a written policy.  It \n24  is the existence of an unwritten practice that the City acknowledged does not afford \n25  unsheltered individuals notice as to when their property will be deemed abandoned and \n26  taken, nor an opportunity to retrieve those items before they are destroyed.  Thus, in light \n27  of the Plaintiffsโ declarations, and the Cityโs failure to introduce evidence to the contrary, \n28  Plaintiffs  can  demonstrate  a  likelihood  of  success  on  the  merits  of  their  Fourteenth \n \n- 10 - \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-02041-GMS   Document 34   Filed 12/16/22   Page 11 of 19\n \n \n \n1  Amendment claims.  \n2  The Courtโs analysis of Plaintiffsโ past injuries does not account for the Cityโs new \n3  enhanced  cleanup  plan  or  abandoned  property  procedure  because  these  plans  were \n4  developed to apply outside the scope of Plaintiffsโ injuries.  To the extent the City uses the \n5  new plans to argue that Plaintiffsโ past injuries are unlikely, it is not disputed that the plans \n6  were not in place at the time of the alleged injuries and will not cover the Cityโs conduct \n7  outside  the  Zone.    Thus,  the  City  cannot  argue  that  the  forthcoming  plan  rebuts  or \n8  invalidates the Plaintiffsโ past injuries outside of the Zone. \n9   However, to the extent the Plaintiffs challenge the enhanced cleanup plan itself as \n10  the City intends to execute it in the Zone, they have not met their burden to demonstrate a \n11  likelihood of success on any claim that it is unconstitutional.  At the preliminary injunction \n12  hearing, Plaintiffs raised various concerns with the enhanced cleanup plan, such as the \n13  length of the initial waiting period before beginning the cleanup, inadequate assistance to \n14  help unsheltered persons move their property, the tagging of property and leaving it for \n15  seven days to determine if it is abandoned, and the thirty-day window to retrieve property \n16  after it is deemed abandoned and removed.  Plaintiffs conceded that they did not provide \n17  any authority to support a holding that 90 days is the constitutional standard for the holding \n18  of property or that 30 days is constitutionally insufficient.  They also did not provide \n19  authority to suggest that seizing property after it has been tagged with a notice that it will \n20  be deemed abandoned in seven days is constitutionally insufficient under the Fourth or \n21  Fourteenth Amendment.    \n22  The policy presently applicable only in the Zone closely aligns with Miralle v. City \n23  of Oakland and Sullivan v. City of Berkeley.  In those cases, the district courts found that \n24  plaintiffs did not have a likelihood of success on the merits when the cities intended to \n25  conduct  cleanups  and  seize  seemingly  abandoned  property  pursuant  to  their  written \n26  procedures.  Miralle, No. 18-cv-06823, 2018 WL 6199929 (N.D. Cal. Nov. 28, 2018); \n27  Sullivan, No. C17-06051, 2017 WL 4922614 (N.D. Cal. Oct. 31, 2017).  Those procedures \n28  included an initial 72 hoursโ notice that property would be seized and storage of the \n \n- 11 - \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-02041-GMS   Document 34   Filed 12/16/22   Page 12 of 19\n \n \n \n1  property for between 14 to 90 days after it was seized.  Miralle, 2018 WL 6199929, at *3; \n2  Sullivan, 2017 WL 4922614, at *6.  In Sullivan, the Court recognized that these notice and \n3  waiting  periods  โapproximately  mirror[ed]  the  requirements  imposed  by  [the  Lavan] \n4  injunction.โ  2017 WL 4922614, at *6.  Here, the same holds true.  The seven-day waiting \n5  period adopted by the City exceeds that of Sullivan and Miralle, and the Plaintiffs provide \n6  no evidence relating to the insufficiency of a 30-day retrieval period as opposed to a 90-day \n7  retrieval period.  Moreover, the Plaintiffs do not establish that the City intends to violate \n8  this plan for cleanups in the Zone.  Thus, the Plaintiffs do not establish a likelihood of \n9  success or serious question on the merits for a challenge to the policyโs constitutionality.       \n10  3.  Fourth Amendment Claims  \n11  The Plaintiffs also establish a likelihood of success on the merits of their Fourth \n12  Amendment claims as to the Cityโs activity outside the scope of the enhanced cleanup plan.  \n13  The Fourth Amendment prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures.  U.S. Const. amend. \n14  IV. โA โseizureโ of property occurs when there is some meaningful interference with an \n15  individualโs possessory interests in that property.โ  United States v. Jacobsen, 466 U.S. \n16  109, 113 (1984).  However, a seizure is only unlawful if it is unreasonable.  U.S. Const. \n17  amend. IV.  To assess the reasonableness of a seizure, courts โmust balance the nature and \n18  quality  of  the  intrusion  on  the  individualโs  Fourth  Amendment  interests  against  the \n19  importance of the governmental interests alleged to justify the intrusion.โ  Id. at 125.  \n20  Additionally, it is clear that โthe Fourth Amendment protects possessory and liberty \n21  interests even when privacy rights are not implicated.โ  Lavan, 693 F.3d at 1028.  In other \n22  words, โa reasonable expectation of privacy is not required to trigger Fourth Amendment \n23  protection against seizures.โ  Id.   \n24  To prevail on their Fourth Amendment claims,  Plaintiffs need to make a showing \n25  that: (1) the City seized their personal effects; (2) the seizure was unreasonable, that is, that \n26  the importance of the governmental interests alleged to justify the intrusion warranted the \n27  nature and quality of the intrusion on the individualโs Fourth Amendment interests, Lavan, \n28  797 F. Supp. 2d at 1013; and (3) the seizure was conducted pursuant to a government policy \n \n- 12 - \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-02041-GMS   Document 34   Filed 12/16/22   Page 13 of 19\n \n \n \n1  or custom that may be fairly said to represent the official policy of the City, Monell, 436 \n2  U.S. at 695.    \n3  Plaintiffs  have  demonstrated  a  likelihood  that  their  property  was  seized  by \n4  Defendants.    Unquestionably,  when  state  actors  seize  unabandoned  property  from \n5  unsheltered individuals such as โlegal papers, shelters, and personal effects, . . . [they] \n6  meaningfully interfere[] with [the ownersโ] interests in that property.โ  Lavan, 693 F.3d at \n7  1030.  As noted above, the City does not contest that wholly separate from the enhanced \n8  cleanup plan currently only applicable in the Zone, it takes and destroys property, including \n9  survival items and personal documents.  If the City alleges that it does so only when \n10  property is abandoned, it is not clear how, if at all, it makes the determination that property \n11  is abandoned.  โAbandonment is determined by the intent of the owner and the โinquiry \n12  should focus on whether, through words, acts or other objective indications, a person has \n13  relinquished a reasonable expectation of privacy in the property.โ  Lavan, 797 F. Supp. 2d \n14  at  1013  (quoting  United  States  v.  Nordling,  804,  F.2d  1466,  1469  (9th  Cir.  1986)).  \n15  Additionally, โthe homeless often arrange their belongings in such a manner as to suggest \n16  ownership[;] . . . the property belonging to homeless persons is reasonably distinguishable \n17  from truly abandoned property.โ  Pottinger v. City of Miami, 810 F. Supp. 1551, 1559 (S.D. \n18  Fla.  1992).    Therefore,  without  any  explanation  as  to  how  the  City  makes  such  a \n19  determination, the Court cannot say it has a practice of only seizing abandoned property.    \n20  Because the City likely engages in seizures of unsheltered personsโ unabandoned \n21  property, โ[n]o more is necessary to trigger the Fourth Amendmentโs reasonableness \n22  requirement.โ  Lavan, 693 F.3d at 1030.  To determine reasonableness, the Court balances \n23  the โinvasion of Plaintiffโs possessory interests in their personal belongings with the Cityโs \n24  reasons for taking the property.โ  Lavan, 797 F. Supp. 2d at 1015.  The City offers \n25  justifications such as addressing nuisances, public safety, and health hazards for taking \n26  unsheltered personsโ property.  (Doc. 18 at 14.)  The City certainly has the power and \n27  responsibility to conduct activities to protect public health and safety. But here the invasion \n28  of the Plaintiffsโ possessory interests outweighs the Cityโs asserted justification.  There is \n \n- 13 - \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-02041-GMS   Document 34   Filed 12/16/22   Page 14 of 19\n \n \n \n1  no indication that the City only seizes items deemed to be health or public safety hazards, \n2  which would align with their purported justifications.  To the contrary, Plaintiffs assert that \n3  they had primarily survival-related items taken, such as clothing, tents, medications, and \n4  identification documents.  (Doc. 2-1 at 3-7.)    \n5  Additionally,  even  if  the  seizure  of  some  unsheltered  individualsโ  property  is \n6  initially lawful under the Fourth Amendment, โan otherwise lawful seizure โat its inception \n7  can  nevertheless  violate  the  Fourth  Amendment  because  its  manner  of  execution \n8  unreasonably  infringes  possessory  interests  protected  by  the  Fourth  Amendmentโs \n9  prohibition against unreasonable seizures.โโ  Lavan, 797 F. Supp. 2d at 1016 (quoting \n10  Jacobsen, 466 U.S. at 124).  In this case, even if public health or safety justified the initial \n11  taking of some or all of the unsheltered individualsโ items, that seizure becomes unlawful \n12  when the City โforever depriv[es] an owner of his or her interests in possessing the property \n13  without recourse.โ  Id.  Thus, even if it is reasonable to take some or all property that poses \n14  a health or safety risk, it is unreasonable to indiscriminately destroy the property that does \n15  not constitute such a hazard without justification.  Lavan, 693 F.3d at 1030 (โ[E]ven if the \n16  seizure of the property would have been deemed reasonable had the City held it for return \n17  to its owner instead of immediately destroying it, the Cityโs destruction of the property \n18  rendered the seizure unreasonable.โ); see also San Jose Charter of Hells Angels Motorcycle \n19  Club v. San Jose, 402 F.3d 962, 975 (9th Cir. 2005) (โThe destruction of property by state \n20  officials poses as much of a threat, if not more, to peopleโs right to be secure in their effects \n21  as does the physical taking of them.โ).  As such, Plaintiffs have demonstrated that they are \n22  likely to succeed on the merits of their Fourth Amendment claims.      \n23  B. Likelihood of Irreparable Harm  \n24  1.  Eighth Amendment Claims \n25  Next, the Court must examine whether Plaintiffs are likely to suffer irreparable harm \n26  in the absence of preliminary relief.  Am. Trucking Assโns v. City of Los Angeles, 559 F.3d \n27  1046,  1052  (9th  Cir.  2009).    โViolations  of  constitutional  rights  โunquestionably \n28  constitutes irreparable injury.โ  Elrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. 347, 373 (1976); Monterey Mech. \n \n- 14 - \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-02041-GMS   Document 34   Filed 12/16/22   Page 15 of 19\n \n \n \n1  Co. v. Wilson, 125 F.3d 702, 715 (9th Cir. 1997) (โ[A]n alleged constitutional infringement \n2  will often alone constitute irreparable harm.โ).  Still, the Plaintiffs must demonstrate that \n3  this irreparable harm is โlikelyโ to occur.  \n4  Here, the parties have presented four pieces of evidence demonstrating that it is.  \n5  First, the City issues citations under the Camping and Sleeping Bans, even if enforcement \n6  in the Zone has declined in recent years.  (Doc. 18 at 2.)  Second, the ordinances remain \n7  unchanged after Martin.  Third, the City does not have enough beds to accommodate its \n8  unsheltered residents.  Fourth, Plaintiffs are chronically unsheltered individuals and an \n9  organization that advocates on behalf of unsheltered individuals. \n10  When taken together, these facts suggest that as long as the City enforces the \n11  Camping and Sleeping Bans when the unsheltered outnumber available beds without \n12  inquiring  as  to  whether  individuals  can  practically  obtain  shelter,  unconstitutional \n13  applications are likely.  As mentioned above, there is not enough shelter space for every \n14  unsheltered person to choose whether to sleep or camp outside.  Thus, any enforcement of \n15  the Camping and Sleeping Bans against individuals who practically cannot obtain shelter \n16  effectively criminalizes homelessness.  And where, as is the case here,  โDefendants \n17  operate[] under the impression that they have authority to detain individuals solely because \n18  of their [] status . . . it [is] reasonable for [a] district court to conclude that the Plaintiffs \n19  face[] a real possibility that they would again be stopped or detained and subjected to \n20  unlawful [action] on the basis of their unlawful presence alone.โ  Melendres v. Arpaio, 695 \n21  F.3d 990, 1002 (9th Cir. 2012).  Accordingly, like the plaintiffs in Melendres, Plaintiffs in \n22  this case have sufficiently shown that they โface[] irreparable harm in the form of a \n23  deprivation of constitutional rights absent a preliminary injunction.โ  Id.  โPlaintiffs have \n24  shown the likelihood of proving past constitutional violations and there is a potential for \n25  continuing violations,โ in the absence of a requirement that the City be enjoined from \n26  enforcing its ordinance against any persons except those that it can demonstrate are \n27  practically able to obtain housing.  Lavan, 797 F. Supp. 2d at 1019. \n28   \n \n- 15 - \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-02041-GMS   Document 34   Filed 12/16/22   Page 16 of 19\n \n \n \n1  2.  Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment Claims  \n2  Plaintiffs  also  establish  a  likelihood  of  irreparable  harm  on  their  Fourth  and \n3  Fourteenth Amendment claims with respect to the Cityโs activities outside the scope of the \n4  enhanced cleanup plan.  As noted above, โan alleged constitutional infringement will often \n5  alone constitute irreparable harm.  Associated Gen. Contractors of Cal., Inc. v. Coalition \n6  for Econ. Equity, 950 F.2d 1401, 1412 (9th Cir. 1991).   \n7  Here,  the  enhanced  cleanup  plan,  which  Plaintiffs  cannot  demonstrate  is \n8  unconstitutional, only applies in the Zone at scheduled cleanup times.  Because Plaintiffs \n9  demonstrate a likelihood that their property has been taken outside of the Zone, they \n10  establish an alleged constitutional infringement.  Further, Plaintiffs have shown that โthere \n11  is a potential for continuing violationsโ because although the City focuses its efforts on \n12  providing the constitutionally required protections to unsheltered personsโ property within \n13  the Zone during official cleanups, it does not provide any indication that it seeks to provide \n14  those very same protections outside of the cleanups in the Zone.  Lavan, 797 F. Supp. 2d \n15  at 1019 (โPlaintiffs have shown the likelihood of proving past constitutional violations and \n16  there is a potential for continuing violations.โ).  Therefore, if Plaintiffs are unsheltered \n17  outside of the Zone, they remain subject to the Cityโs practice of taking property without \n18  notice and destroying the property without allowing adequate time for the Plaintiffs to \n19  retrieve it.   \n20  Lastly, the Cityโs argument that this harm is not irreparable because it can be \n21  recompensed in economic damages ignores the reality of the Plaintiffsโ situations in this \n22  case.  While it may often be the case that taking a tent, an article of clothing, or bedding, \n23  constitutes a chiefly economic injury, in this case, when the City takes those items, it may \n24  be taking everything the person owns.  Additionally, the Plaintiffs have offered evidence \n25  that the Defendants failed to rebut, that the City takes items that are not so easily recovered \n26  in economic damages such as medications, birth certificates, personal mementos, and other \n27  identification documents necessary to obtaining employment and shelter.  Thus, the harm \n28  that Plaintiffs face is irreparable.        \n \n- 16 - \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-02041-GMS   Document 34   Filed 12/16/22   Page 17 of 19\n \n \n \n1  C. Balance of the Equities  \n2  The balance of hardship also tips in Plaintiffsโ favor on their Eighth Amendment \n3  Claims.  Without a preliminary injunction, Plaintiffs face a continued threat of citation \n4  under  the  Camping  and  Sleeping  Bans.    Legally,  this  threat  is  a  hardship  because \n5  enforcement of the ordinances against individuals that cannot practically obtain shelter \n6  violates their Eighth Amendment rights.  Practically speaking, this threat is also a hardship \n7  because it creates a sense of fear and instability among the Cityโs most vulnerable residents \n8  through no fault of their own.   \n9  Admittedly, issuing an injunction will also impose hardships on the Defendants if \n10  they wish to continue easily enforcing the ordinances.  The injunction requires the City to \n11  determine whether individuals are voluntarily homeless before citing them under the \n12  Camping and Sleeping Bans.  Such assessments will be fact-specific and could prove \n13  inherently  difficult  to  administer;  they  might  also  require  the  City  to  increase  its \n14  coordination  with  shelters  or  allocate  more  resources  to  addressing  homelessness.  \n15  However, Defendants concede that they are constitutionally obligated to shoulder such \n16  hardships.  (Doc. 18 at 11 (โPrior to any criminal enforcement, officers must investigate \n17  the individualโs circumstances and determine if there is shelter space available.โ).)  Thus \n18  there are no real equities to balance.  If the City wishes to enforce its ordinances, it must \n19  comply with the Constitution in doing so.     \n20  The balance of the equities also tips toward the Plaintiffs on their property-related \n21  claims as to the Cityโs activities outside the scope of the enhanced cleanup plan.  In the \n22  absence of an injunction, Plaintiffs face a likelihood that any or all of their belongings \n23  could be seized or destroyed pursuant to the Cityโs practices.  The City, on the other hand, \n24  is minimally harmed by an injunction.  Importantly, it retains authority to engage in the \n25  actions it has a legitimate interest in.  Namely, it โwill still be able to lawfully seize and \n26  detain property, as well as remove hazardous debris and other trash.โ  Lavan, 797 F. Supp. \n27  2d at 1019.  The City will only be prevented from engaging in actions it has no legitimate \n28  interest  in,  that  is,  โunlawfully  seizing  and  destroying  personal  property  that  is  not \n \n- 17 - \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-02041-GMS   Document 34   Filed 12/16/22   Page 18 of 19\n \n \n \n1  abandoned without providing any meaningful notice and opportunity to be heard.โ  Id.  \n2  Additionally, to whatever extent a requirement to provide notice and maintain seized \n3  property for 30 days can be seen as a hardship to the City, it has demonstrated the \n4  willingness and ability to establish such a protocol within the Zone.  (Doc. 18-1 at 6.)  The \n5  potential administrative burden on the City associated with expanding those protections \n6  outside the Zone does not outweigh the Plaintiffsโ interests in ensuring their unabandoned \n7  property is not indiscriminately destroyed, whatever city block it may be found on.      \n8  D. Public Interest  \n9  Finally, the Plaintiffs have shown that a preliminary injunction is in the public \n10  interest with respect to their Eighth Amendment claims.  Although the publicโs interest in \n11  enforcing the Camping and Sleeping Bans is legitimate, this interest is not sufficient to \n12  overcome the fact that the Constitution protects unsheltered individuals from statutes that \n13  โeffectively punish them for something for which they may not be convicted under the \n14  [E]ighth [A]mendmentโsleeping, eating and other innocent conduct.โ  Martin, 920 F.3d \n15  at 617.  Indeed, โit is always in the public interest to prevent the violation of a partyโs \n16  constitutional  rights,โ  especially  where  a  party  is  among  โthose  most  in  need  of \n17  [constitutional] protections.โ Melendres, 695 F.3d at 1002; Cobine v. City of Eureka \n18  (Cobine II), No. C 16-02239 JSW, 2016 WL 1730084, at *7 (N.D. Cal. May 2, 2016).   \n19  Further, entering a narrow injunction preventing unlawful seizures and destruction \n20  of property is also in the public interest.  The injunction does not prevent the City from \n21  moving forward with its facially constitutional enhanced cleanups of the Zone or lawfully \n22  engaging in its regular public health and safety activities.  Therefore, the public is not \n23  harmed by an injunction requiring basic constitutional protections for unsheltered personsโ \n24  property.   \n25  CONCLUSION    \n26  Accordingly, all four Winter factors tilt in Plaintiffsโ favor on their claims, except \n27  the likelihood of success on their challenge to the constitutionality of the Cityโs enhanced \n28  cleanup plan within the Zone.  Thus,  \n \n- 18 - \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-02041-GMS   Document 34   Filed 12/16/22   Page 19 of 19\n \n \n \n1  IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED  that the Motion for Preliminary Injunction \n2  (Doc. 2) is GRANTED in part and DENIED in part.  \n3  IT  IS  FURTHER  ORDERED that  the  City,  its  agents  and  employees,  are \n4  preliminarily enjoined from doing any of the following: \n5  1.

Since 2010, the number of people experiencing homelessness in the City of \n3  Phoenix (the โCityโ or โPhoenixโ) has more than doubled.1 \n4  2.  Meanwhile sustainable solutions, including affordable housing, have lagged \n5  far behind. For example, as of the filing of this Complaint, the City has spent less than 10% \n6  of the $99.5 million it received from the federal government through the American Rescue \n7  Plan Act in order to address homelessness and affordable housing.2 \n8  3.  Despite  allocating  $16  million  for  temporary  shelter,  heat  relief,  and \n9  additional services for unsheltered individuals in Maricopa County (the โCountyโ), the City \n10  has spent less than five percent of these funds to date.3 Meanwhile, temperatures during the \n11  summer  averaged  106โ,  contributing  to  the  deaths  of  over  one  hundred  unsheltered \n12  individuals. \n13  4.  Notwithstanding  the  fact  that  shelters  are  only  a  temporary  solution  to \n14  homelessness, the Cityโs efforts to supply temporary shelter fall far short of the need. \n15  According to the January 2022 Point-in-Time count, which considerably undercounts the \n16  unsheltered population, 2,942 people in Phoenix were temporarily housed in an emergency \n17  shelter  or  transitional  housing  while  3,096  people  in  Phoenix  remained  completely \n18  unsheltered.4 \n19 \n20 \n \n21 \n1  Compare  MARICOPA  ASSโN  OF  GOVโTS,  2010  HOMELESS  STREET  COUNT, \nhttps://www.azmag.gov/Portals/0/Documents/MagContent/2010%20Point%20in%20Time\n22 \n%20Count%20for%20AZ-502%20(Municipal%20Street%20Count).pdf?ver=2017-07-07-\n134153-897 with MARICOPA ASSโN OF GOVโTS, 2022 POINT-IN-TIME (PIT) COUNT REPORT \n23 \n1,  https://www.azmag.gov/Portals/0/Documents/MagContent/2022-PIT-Count-Report-\nFinal.pdf?ver=mHByGa3hHNtmeOOfMZxctA%3d%3d. \n24 \n2  See  Erica  Stapleton,  Katie  Wilcox  &  John  Tanet,  โBuilding  housing  isnโt  a  quick \n25  processโ: Phoenix weighs in on millions in COVID relief money for homelessness that \nhasnโt been spent, 12 NEWS, https://www.12news.com/article/news/local/arizona/the-cost-\n26  of-crisis-phoenix-struggles-with-a-homelessness-crisis-after-covid/75-bd422dcb-4663-\n4b98-8f71-11aea9e76bda (last updated Sept. 1, 2022, 6:17 PM). \n27 \n3  American  Rescue  Plan  ActโAffordable  Housing  &  Homelessness,  CITY  OF  PHX., \nhttps://stories.opengov.com/phoenixaz/published/CcabFkLY8 (last visited Nov. 24, 2022). \n28 \n4 See 2022 POINT-IN-TIME (PIT) COUNT REPORT, supra note 1, at 4โ5. \n \n4862-0321-1840   \n  - 2 - \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02041-GMS   Document 1   Filed 11/30/22   Page 3 of 24\n \n1  5.  Since 2020, the unsheltered subset of the homeless population5 in the County, \n2  which includes Phoenix, grew by 34%. This means that the total number of unsheltered \n3  people in the County surpasses the number of this population in shelters (5,029 to 3,997).6 \n4  6.  Black,  Indigenous,  and  other  people  of  color  (โBIPOCโ  people)  are \n5  disproportionately  affected  by  this  crisis.  In  the  County,  Black  people  โexperience \n6  homelessness at a rate 3.9 times greater than their share of the general population.โ The \n7  Indigenous proportion of the homeless population in the County โis more than twice its \n8  share of the general population.\"7 \n9  7.  Many unsheltered persons congregate on the west side of downtown Phoenix \n10  in an area known as the โZone.โ The Zone is near the Human Services Campus which has \n11  provided wrap-around human services to help those in crisis achieve stability since 2005.8 \n12  8.  The  City  has  responded  to  this  growing  epidemic  of  homelessness  by \n13  directing the City of Phoenix Police Department (โPPDโ) to wage a campaign of raids called \n14  โclean sweepsโ to target those experiencing homelessness.9 \n15  9.  These raids by PPD criminalize, punish, and scatter this population based on \n16  their status as unsheltered despite the Cityโs knowledge that these individuals have nowhere \n17  else to go given the dearth of affordable housing and emergency shelter space.10 \n18 \n \n19  5The condition of being unsheltered denotes the lack of physical shelter, while โhomelessโ \nrefers to the lack of permanent housing experienced by people living in cars, temporary \n20  shelters, or with friends. \n6 See 2022 POINT-IN-TIME (PIT) COUNT REPORT, supra note 1, at 1, 4โ5. \n21 \n7  JEFF  OLIVET  &  DONALD  WHITEHEAD,  RACIAL  EQUITY  PARTNERS  ,  RACE  AND \n22  HOMELESSNESS IN MARICOPA COUNTY, ARIZONA: EXAMINING THE INTERSECTIONS 2, 7 \n(2021),  https://azmag.gov/Portals/0/Documents/MagContent/DRAFT-Maricopa-Racial-\n23  Equity-Report.pdf?ver=2021-02-04-154206-543. \n8 See Melissa Blasius, How Phoenix decides whatโs trash vs. property during controversial \n24 \nhomeless  camp  sweeps,  ABC15,  https://www.abc15.com/news/local-\nnews/investigations/how-phoenix-decides-whats-trash-vs-property-during-controversial-\n25 \nhomeless-camp-sweeps (last updated Mar. 6, 2022, 9:51 AM); About, HUMAN SERVICES \nCAMPUS, https://hsc-az.org/about/ (last visited November 28, 2022). \n26 \n9 Blasius, supra note 8. \n27 \n10 See Madeline Ackley, Phoenix still criminalizes homelessness, despite court ruling, \nprotesters say (Jan. 9, 2020, 9:13 AM),  https://www.azmirror.com/2020/01/09/phoenix-\n28 \nstill-criminalizes-homelessness-despite-court-ruling-protesters-say/. \n \n4862-0321-1840   \n  - 3 - \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02041-GMS   Document 1   Filed 11/30/22   Page 4 of 24\n \n1  10.  But  the  City  does  not  stop  at  criminalizing  residents  based  on  their \n2  unsheltered status. PPD officers performing raids also indiscriminately seize, impound, and \n3  destroy unsheltered individualsโ personal property and survival gear without cause or a \n4  warrant. \n5  11.  During these raids, unsheltered individuals (including Plaintiffs Faith Kearns \n6  and Frank Urban) have lost clothing, survival equipment, medication, items of sentimental \n7  value (like photographs of loved ones), and, perhaps most inexplicably, vital records and \n8  identifying documentsโlike birth certificates and reference lettersโwhich are crucial to \n9  procuring jobs, benefits, and housing. These documents can be almost impossible for \n10  someone with no fixed address to replace.11 \n11  12.  In  sum,  rather  than  confront  its  housing  crisis  head-on  and  invest  in \n12  sustainable solutions to homelessness, the City is terrorizing the very people it should be \n13  helping.  The  City  is  knowingly  penalizing  unsheltered  residents  for  engaging  in \n14  unavoidable human activities like sleeping and sheltering from the elements. Additionally, \n15  it is unlawfully seizing and destroying their personal property in an attempt to push the \n16  unsheltered out of the City all to avoid implementing alternative solutions which could \n17  provide relief to unsheltered individuals.12 \n18  JURISDICTION & VENUE \n19  13.  Plaintiffs bring this action for declaratory and injunctive relief pursuant to 42 \n20  U.S.C. ยง 1983 for violations of civil rights under the Fourth, Eighth, and Fourteenth \n21  Amendments to the United States Constitution. \n22  14.  This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 1331, which gives district \n23  courts original jurisdiction over civil actions arising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties \n24 \n \n25 \n11 See Bailey Miller, โIt is simply inhumaneโ: Phoenix homeless advocates criticize city \nsweeps of encampments, FOX 10 PHX.

Declaratory relief is authorized by 28 U.S.C. ยงยง 2201-02. \n4  16.  The events that gave rise to the Complaint occurred in Maricopa County, \n5  Arizona in the District of Arizona. Venue is appropriate in this judicial district under 28 \n6  U.S.C. ยง 1391(b). \n7  PARTIES \n8  17.  Plaintiff Fund for Empowerment (โFFEโ) is an incorporated nonprofit charity \n9  operating in the County that commonly expends time, energy, effort, and resources on \n10  behalf of the unsheltered population. FFEโs mission is to build community resources for the \n11  unsheltered population via direct services, capacity-building training, and project support. \n12  FFE  helps  protect  and  advocate  for  the  dignity,  rights,  and  choices  of  Arizonans \n13  experiencing homelessness or housing insecurity. FFE commits its efforts toward goals \n14  affirmed  and  raised  by  unsheltered  individuals.  FFE  emphasizes  the  voices  of  the \n15  unsheltered to expose root causes of homelessness and to create ways of living in which \n16  everyone has a safe place they can call home. \n17  18.  The individual Plaintiffs in this action are members of FFE and graduates of \n18  FFEโs Houseless Leadership Project, which empowers unsheltered individuals with coping \n19  mechanisms  and  resources  to  achieve  stability  for  themselves  and  others  who  are \n20  experiencing housing insecurity. \n21  19.  Plaintiff Faith Kearns (โMs. Kearnsโ) is a chronically unsheltered individual \n22  who resides in Maricopa County, Arizona. Ms. Kearns has directly experienced the raids \n23  performed by the City and PPD which have resulted in the destruction of her personal \n24  property. \n25  20.  Plaintiff Frank Urban (โMr. Urbanโ) has been chronically unsheltered off and \n26  on since 2000 in Maricopa County, Arizona. Mr. Urban has received criminal citations from \n27  PPD for trespassing, obstructing a thoroughfare, and simply standing on the sidewalk in \n28 \n \n4862-0321-1840   \n  - 5 - \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02041-GMS   Document 1   Filed 11/30/22   Page 6 of 24\n \n1  connection to his unsheltered status. Mr. Urban has directly experienced the raids performed \n2  by the City and PPD which have resulted in the destruction of his personal property. \n3  21.  Defendant City of Phoenix is a political subdivision of the state of Arizona \n4  that acts through its employees, agents, and independent contractors. PPD is a department \n5  or division of the City that acts with the Cityโs authority. \n6  22.  At the time of the incidents described in Plaintiffsโ Complaint, Defendant Jeri \n7  Williams (โDefendant Williamsโ) resided and worked in the County. \n8  23.  At all times material hereto, Defendant Williams was the acting Chief of \n9  Police for the PPD with ultimate authority to control, and responsibility for, the actions of \n10  PPD officers and agents. Defendant Williams also had the authority and responsibility to \n11  establish policies, practices, customs, procedures, protocols, and training for the PPD. \n12  Defendant Williams is named herein in her official capacity. \n13  24.  Defendant  Michael  Sullivan  (โDefendant  Sullivanโ)  resides  or  works  in \n14  Maricopa County, Arizona. \n15  25.  At all times material hereto, Defendant Sullivan is the Interim Chief of Police \n16  for the PPD with ultimate authority to control, and responsibility for, the actions of its \n17  officers and agents. Defendant Sullivan also has the authority and responsibility to establish \n18  policies, practices, customs, procedures, protocols, and training for the PPD. Defendant \n19  Sullivan is named herein in his official capacity. \n20  26.  Entities โI-Xโ and โJane and John Doesโ are fictitious entities and unknown \n21  persons who are properly included as parties to this lawsuit to assert or defend the claims \n22  asserted herein but whose true identities are unknown. Plaintiffs will seek to amend this \n23  Complaint when and if the true identities of such people or entities become known. \n24   \n25  /// \n26   \n27  /// \n28   \n \n4862-0321-1840   \n  - 6 - \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02041-GMS   Document 1   Filed 11/30/22   Page 7 of 24\n \n1  GENERAL FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \n2  Background \n3  27.  The number of residents experiencing homelessness in Phoenix has nearly \n4  doubled  since  2010  according  to  Point-in-Time  (โPITโ)  counts  commissioned  by  the \n5  Maricopa Association of Governments (โMAGโ).13 \n6  28.  This increase directly relates to the Cityโs lack of affordable housing for \n7  residents that has only been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic.14 \n8  29.  Without  an  adequate  supply  of  affordable  housing,  people  can  become \n9  unsheltered after disruptions in household income caused by job loss, medical bankruptcy, \n10  mental illness, divorce, or domestic violence. \n11  30.  In 2010, about 1,750 unsheltered individuals were reported as experiencing \n12  homelessness in the PIT by MAG.15 \n13  31.  In 2020, the number of unsheltered individuals experiencing homelessness in \n14  the City increased to 2,380, according to the PIT.16 \n15  32.  In 2022, that number has further increased to 3,096.17 \n16  33.  Problematically,  despite  an  unsheltered  population  exceeding  3,000 \n17  individuals, the City only has approximately 1,788 shelter beds available for those who are \n18  experiencing homelessness.18 \n \n19 \n13 A PIT count is โan annual street and shelter count to determine the number of people \nexperiencing homelessness in Maricopa County during a given point in time.โ See Point-\n20 \nIn-Time  Homeless  Count,  MARICOPA  ASSโN  OF  GOVโTS,  \nhttps://azmag.gov/Programs/Homelessness/Data/Point-In-Time-Homeless-Count  (last \n21 \naccessed Nov. 28, 2022); 2010 HOMELESS STREET COUNT, supra note 1; 2022 POINT-IN-\n22  TIME (PIT) COUNT REPORT, supra note 1, at 1. \n14 Median home prices in Phoenix metro area grew by over 200% during the past decade, \n23  while the median income has grown only 16%.

Although the Phoenix City Council approved rezoning to allow an additional \n2  275 beds at Arizonaโs largest shelter, Central Arizona Shelter Services in the Human \n3  Services Campus, the increase remains inadequate to shelter the unsheltered population in \n4  Phoenix. \n5  35.  Moreover, while emergency shelters can temporarily accommodate some \n6  people experiencing homelessness, they are not an adequate response to Phoenixโs rapid \n7  increase in unsheltered residents. Research shows that the most effective way to end chronic \n8  homelessness is to provide permanent supportive housing on a housing-first basis.19 \n9  36.  Despite those experiencing homelessness in Phoenix having nowhere else to \n10  go,  for  years  the  City  has  engaged  in  โclean  sweepsโ  which  target  the  unsheltered \n11  population. \n12  The Cityโs Raids \n13  37.  For at least the past two years, the City has engaged in raids it calls โclean \n14  sweepsโ of areas occupied by unsheltered individuals and those experiencing homelessness. \n15  38.  During these raids, unsheltered individuals (including Plaintiffs and those \n16  served by FFE) are roused from sleep by PPD officers in the early morning hours and told \n17  to pack up their blankets, tents, and all their personal belongings. \n18  39.  Some of these raids occur as early as 3:00 AM. \n19  40.  The City directs the PPD and โclean-upโ crews to remove property. \n20  41.  Unsheltered  individuals  (including  Plaintiffs  and  those  served  by  FFE) \n21  typically have just minutes to gather their personal possessions and belongings before the \n22  raid begins. \n23  42.  Because mere minutes are not enough time to gather and relocate possessions \n24  (particularly for people with disabilities), the inevitable result of the Cityโs raids is that \n25  people permanently lose any property they cannot immediately carry away with them. \n26 \n \n  \n27 \n19 See, e.g., Homelessness Resources: Housing and Shelter, SUBSTANCE ABUSE & \n28  MENTAL HEALTH SERVS. ADMIN., https://www.samhsa.gov/homelessness-programs-\nresources/hpr-resources/housing-shelter (last accessed Nov. 28, 2022). \n \n4862-0321-1840   \n  - 8 - \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02041-GMS   Document 1   Filed 11/30/22   Page 9 of 24\n \n1  43.  Once individuals move from the location where they were sleeping, the PPD \n2  and โclean-upโ crews indiscriminately remove and destroy any remaining items. \n3  44.  Removal is performed with rakes, garbage bags, loaders, and sometimes a \n4  disposal truck. \n5  45.  These raids commonly result in the loss and destruction of personal property \n6  owned by those experiencing homelessness. \n7  46.  Individuals (including Plaintiffs and those served by FFE) also frequently \n8  experience destruction of items difficult to replace such as personal IDs, photographs of \n9  family members and loved ones, and in one case, even a set of teeth.20 \n10  47.  Plaintiffs were never provided notification of when these raids would occur. \n11  48.  Upon information and belief, the purpose of these raids is to discourage \n12  individuals experiencing homelessness from sleeping in the City and to push them to other \n13  surrounding municipalities surrounding Phoenix in the County. \n14  49.  Upon information and belief, the City has used these raids to address the rise \n15  in those experiencing homelessness to divert criticism for failing to adequately provide both \n16  emergency and permanent housing. \n17  50.  It is expected these raids will begin to intensify in a homeless encampment \n18  near 12th Avenue and Madison Street nicknamed โthe Zone.โ This is because of a lawsuit \n19  filed against the City in Arizona State Court. See Brown v. City of Phoenix, CV2022-010439 \n20  (2022) (the โBrown Lawsuitโ). This case was brought by individuals with property in or \n21  around the Zone and alleges Defendants have allowed for the creation of a public nuisance. \n22  The Cityโs Weaponization of Statutes and Ordinances to Criminalize Homelessness \n23  51.  During the Cityโs raids, police often issue mass criminal citations under the \n24  Arizona Revised Statutes and City Ordinances. \n25  52.  The City has cited individuals for violation of Arizona Revised Statute ยง 13-\n26  2906 (the โJaywalking Lawโ), Phoenix City Code ยง 23-30 (the โCamping Banโ), and \n27  Phoenix City Code ยง 23-48.01 (the โSleeping Banโ). \n \n28 \n20 See Blasius, supra note 8. \n \n4862-0321-1840   \n  - 9 - \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02041-GMS   Document 1   Filed 11/30/22   Page 10 of 24\n \n1  53.  The Jaywalking Law prohibits a person from โobstructing a highway or other \n2  public thoroughfare if the personโฆ[h]aving no legal privilege to do so, recklessly interferes \n3  with the passage of any highway or public thoroughfare by creating an unreasonable \n4  inconvenience or hazard.โ Ariz. Rev. Stat. ยง 13-2906(1). \n5  54.  The Jaywalking Law is cited indiscriminately by the City against unsheltered \n6  individuals during raids to discourage basic activities such as sleeping and walking. \n7  55.  The Camping Ban provides: โIt shall be unlawful for any person to camp in \n8  any park or preserve, or in any building, facility, or parking lot or structure, or on any \n9  property adjacent thereto, that is owned, possessed and controlled by the Cityโฆ.โ Phx., \n10  Ariz., CITY CODE ยง 23-30(A). \n11  56.  According to the City, camping means โto use real property of the City for \n12  living accommodation purposes such as sleeping activities, or making preparations to sleep, \n13  including the laying down of bedding for the purpose of sleeping, or storing personal \n14  belongings, or making any fire, or using any tents or shelter or other structure or vehicle for \n15  sleeping or doing any digging or earth breaking or carrying on cooking activities.โ Phx., \n16  Ariz., CITY CODE ยง 23-30(B). \n17  57.  As indicated in the Cityโs definition of the term โcamp,โ the Camping Ban \n18  punishes and criminalizes the act of sleeping by unsheltered individuals within the City. \n19  58.  The  Camping  Ban  is  commonly  cited  by  the  City  against  unsheltered \n20  individuals during raids to discourage basic human activities such as sleeping. \n21  59.  The Sleeping Ban provides: โIt shall be unlawful for any person to use a \n22  public street, highway, alley, lane, parkway, sidewalk or other right-of-way, whether such \n23  right-of-way has been dedicated to the public in fee or by easement, for lying, sleeping or \n24  otherwise remaining in a sitting position thereon, except in the case of a physical emergency \n25  or the administration of medical assistance.โ Phx., Ariz., CITY CODE ยง 23-48.01. \n26  60.  The Sleeping Ban is broad and prohibits sleeping on areas of City property \n27  otherwise unused by pedestrians. \n28 \n \n4862-0321-1840   \n  - 10 - \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02041-GMS   Document 1   Filed 11/30/22   Page 11 of 24\n \n1  61.  The  Sleeping  Ban  is  commonly  cited  by  the  City  against  unsheltered \n2  individuals during raids to discourage universal and unavoidable human activities such as \n3  sleeping. \n4  62.  The  use  of  these  statutes  and  ordinances  by  the  City  are  intended  to \n5  criminalize homelessness. \n6  63.  Despite  neighboring  municipalities  amending  their  policies  and  halting \n7  enforcement of similar ordinances, the City has continued to enforce its unconstitutional \n8  ordinances even when housing and temporary shelter are not practically available to its \n9  homeless residents. \n10  64.  The city of Tempe, for example, admitted enforcement of its camping ban \n11  would be unconstitutional. \n12  65.  The city of Glendale amended its ordinance to prevent imposing criminal \n13  sanctions on camping โwhen no alternative shelter is available.โ Glendale, Ariz., CITY \n14  CODE ยง 25-90. \n15  66.  Meanwhile, Phoenix has continued to enforce its Camping Ban and refused \n16  to amend its Camping Ban or Sleeping Ban. \n17  67.  Upon information and belief, the City cites individuals with violations of \n18  these (and other) statutes/codes to discourage individuals experiencing homelessness from \n19  sleeping in the City and to push them to other surrounding municipalities in the County. \n20  68.  Upon information and belief, the City uses these statutes and ordinances in \n21  place of finding humane solutions for those experiencing homelessness within the City. \n22  Plaintiff Faith Kearnsโ Experience \n23  69.  Ms. Kearns was born and raised in Arizona and attended Washington High \n24  School in the city of Glendale. \n25  70.  Due to various medical issues and the costs associated with medical care, she \n26  has been chronically unsheltered since approximately 2008. \n27  71.  When she is unsheltered, Ms. Kearns sleeps on Phoenix public streets. \n28  72.  Ms. Kearns has also slept in or around the Zone. \n \n4862-0321-1840   \n  - 11 - \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02041-GMS   Document 1   Filed 11/30/22   Page 12 of 24\n \n1  73.  While sleeping within the City as an unsheltered individual, Ms. Kearns has \n2  experienced the raids firsthand. \n3  74.  Ms.  Kearns  describes  these  sweeps  as  โraidsโ  because  they  happened \n4  suddenly and without warning in the early morning hours. \n5  75.  Ms. Kearns remembers the raids sometimes happening three to five days per \n6  week. \n7  76.  Ms. Kearns remembers the raids increasing during and around holidays. \n8  77.  Ms. Kearns was never provided with a search warrant. \n9  78.  During these raids, Ms. Kearns has had personal possessions and belongings \n10  destroyed. \n11  79.  The following was taken from Ms. Kearns by the PPD and City workers \n12  during the raids: an Arizona ID card, a Visa Card on which her social security disability \n13  income was loaded, tent, blankets, bedding, birth certificate, medications, and clothing. \n14  80.  Ms. Kearns remembers being forced to watch the PDD destroy her items. \n15  81.  Ms.  Kearns also remembers receiving  citations from the  City  under the \n16  Jaywalking Law, Camping Ban, and Sleeping Ban. \n17  82.  Ms. Kearns has received other citations related to her unsheltered status such \n18  as a citation for trespassing. \n19  83.  Ms. Kearns believes the Cityโs raids are designed to push her out of the City. \n20  84.  Ms. Kearns believes the Cityโs use of citations is to criminalize her status as \n21  an unsheltered individual. \n22  Plaintiff Frank Urbanโs Experience \n23  85.  Mr. Urban is a resident of Maricopa County and currently resides in Phoenix. \n24  86.  Due to various medical issues, Mr. Urban became chronically unsheltered off \n25  and on starting in 2000. \n26  87.  During the time periods when Mr. Urban has been unsheltered, he has slept \n27  outside in various parts of the City. \n28  88.  During these times, Mr. Urban has directly experienced the Cityโs raids. \n \n4862-0321-1840   \n  - 12 - \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02041-GMS   Document 1   Filed 11/30/22   Page 13 of 24\n \n1  89.  Mr. Urban was never provided with a search warrant. \n2  90.  During these raids, Mr. Urban has had his possessions thrown away numerous \n3  times. \n4  91.  In fact, his possessions have been thrown away so many times, it is difficult \n5  for him to remember dates for each incident as they all โblend together.โ \n6  92.  Nevertheless, Mr. Urban remembers the following being taken from him and \n7  destroyed: an Arizona ID card, tent, blankets, bedding, medications, clothing, food, and \n8  water. \n9  93.  Mr. Urban remembers raids intensifying around Thanksgiving and Christmas. \n10  94.  Mr.  Urban  also  remembers  receiving  citations  from  the  City  under  the \n11  Jaywalking Law, Camping Ban, and Sleeping Ban. \n12  95.  Mr. Urban has received other citations from the City in connection to his \n13  status as unsheltered. \n14  96.  Mr. Urban believes the Cityโs raids are designed to push him out of the City. \n15  97.  Mr. Urban believes the Cityโs use of citations is to criminalize his status as an \n16  unsheltered individual. \n17  The Fund for Empowermentโs Work on Behalf of the Unsheltered Community \n18  98.  Since 2018, the Fund for Empowerment has spent monetary resources in \n19  support of its mission to help provide education, training, and leadership courses to the \n20  unsheltered community to combat policies and practices by the City which target them. \n21  99.  FFE commonly works within the City, including the Zone. \n22  100.  FFEโs membership includes those who are unsheltered. \n23  101.  FFE commonly creates and prints written materials for dissemination to the \n24  unsheltered community which include information about their rights under the United States \n25  Constitution. \n26  102.  FFE provides training to the unsheltered community about their rights in \n27  response to the raids conducted by the City. \n28 \n \n4862-0321-1840   \n  - 13 - \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02041-GMS   Document 1   Filed 11/30/22   Page 14 of 24\n \n1  103.  FFE provides training to the unsheltered community about their right to sleep \n2  outside in connection to the Cityโs use of ordinances to criminalize sleeping. \n3  104.  FFE would not have to expend these resources on behalf of its members if the \n4  City stopped conducting raids and using laws and ordinances to criminalize homelessness. \n5  105.  If FFE did not have to expend resources helping unsheltered individuals \n6  understand their rights in response to Defendants raids and criminal citations, FFE could \n7  spend  resources  training  unsheltered  individuals  to  become  their  own  advocates  in \n8  requesting resources from the City for housing and shelter. \n9  106.  If FFE did not have to expend resources helping unsheltered individuals, FFE \n10  could also distribute more water and food to the unsheltered community during the summer \n11  months. FFE could also provide more supplies to the unsheltered community which would \n12  improve individualsโ quality of life.  \n13  The Cityโs Latest Planned โSweepsโ \n14  107.  On November 15, 2022, the Phoenix New Times reported the City and the \n15  PPD plan to restart their raids/sweeps in the Zone.21 \n16  108.  The City plans to start what it calls โenhanced sweepsโ which will commence \n17  in December 2022. \n18  109.  It is believed these sweeps are the result of the Brown Lawsuit. \n19  110.  During these raids/sweeps, Defendants intend to direct the PPD to block roads \n20  and remove people from their tents and makeshift shelters. \n21  111.  Upon information and belief, the City intends to destroy the property of the \n22  unsheltered community during these sweeps. \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n \n21 See Katya Schwenk, Phoenix Prepares to Restart Controversial Cleanups of Homeless \n27 \nEncampment,  PHX.

Upon information and belief, the Cityโs only reason for performing these \n2  sweeps is in response to the Brown lawsuit brought by Phoenix residents which requests \n3  relief which would violate the constitutional rights of the unsheltered community.22   \n4  CLAIMS FOR RELIEF \n5  Count One \n6  (Fourth Amendment ViolationโUnlawful Seizure) \n7  (42 U.S.C. ยง 1983)  \n8  (All Defendants) \n9  113.  Plaintiffs re-allege the foregoing paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n10  114.  At all times relevant to the allegations in this Complaint, Defendants acted \n11  under color of state law. \n12  115.  Under the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution, Plaintiffs \n13  have the right to be secure in their persons against unreasonable seizures. \n14  116.  A seizure of property occurs under the Fourth Amendment when there is some \n15  meaningful  interference  with  an  individualโs  possessory  interests  in  that  property; \n16  meaningful interferences include destruction of property. See United States v. Jacobsen, \n17  466 U.S. 109, 113 (1984). \n18  117.  Property includes photographs, identification papers, portable electronics, \n19  and even potentially abandoned property. See Lavan v. City of Los Angeles, 693 F.3d 1022, \n20  1030 (9th Cir. 2012). \n21  118.  Here, Defendants have engaged and will continue to engage in targeted raids \n22  of areas occupied by the unsheltered community. \n23  119.  During  these  raids,  Defendants  unreasonably  seize  and  destroy  property \n24  regardless of its condition, its apparent value, and/or whether or not it has been voluntarily \n25  abandoned. \n26 \n \n27 \n22 See Melissa Blasius, Lawsuit aims to force Phoenix homeless camp abatement, ABC15, \nhttps://www.abc15.com/news/local-news/lawsuit-aims-to-force-phoenix-homeless-camp-\n28 \nabatement (last updated Aug. 11, 2022, 6:18 PM) \n \n4862-0321-1840   \n  - 15 - \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02041-GMS   Document 1   Filed 11/30/22   Page 16 of 24\n \n1  120.  Plaintiffs Ms. Kearns and Mr. Urban (and other unsheltered people who are \n2  members of FFE) have experienced destruction of their personal items by Defendants \n3  including the destruction of photographs, identification papers, camping equipment, and \n4  other unabandoned personal items within the past two years. \n5  121.  Plaintiffs have seen the destruction of personal items of other unsheltered \n6  individuals including items deemed abandoned by Defendants within the past two years. \n7  122.  By seizing and destroying Plaintiffsโ property, Defendants meaningfully and \n8  permanently interfered with Plaintiffsโ possessory interest in their property and unlawfully \n9  seized Plaintiffsโ property. \n10  123.  At no time did Defendants provide a warrant to seize Plaintiffsโ property. \n11  124.  Seizures without a warrant are presumptively unconstitutional. \n12  125.  Defendants engage in warrantless seizures of property when no exception to \n13  the warrant requirement applies. \n14  126.  Plaintiffs  have  a  possessory  interest  in  their  property  under  the  Fourth \n15  Amendment. \n16  127.  A reasonable official in Chief Williams and Interim Chief Sullivansโ positions \n17  would have known that seizing and destroying Plaintiffsโ property constitutes a violation of \n18  the Fourth Amendment. \n19  128.  Plaintiffsโ loss of property was the direct and proximate cause of Defendantsโ \n20  seizure and destruction of their property. \n21  129.  The acts of Defendants were intentional and deprived Plaintiffs of their rights, \n22  privileges, liberties, and immunities secured by the Constitution of the United States. \n23  Count Two \n24  (Fourteenth Amendment Violation โ Deprivation of Property without Due Process) \n25  (42 U.S.C. ยง 1983) \n26  (All Defendants) \n27  130.  Plaintiffs re-allege the foregoing paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n28 \n \n4862-0321-1840   \n  - 16 - \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02041-GMS   Document 1   Filed 11/30/22   Page 17 of 24\n \n1  131.  The Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides that \n2  no state shall โdeprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.โ \n3  132.  Under the Fourteenth Amendment, โthe government may not take property \n4  like a thief in the night; rather, it must announce its intentions and give the property owner \n5  a chance to argue against the taking.โ Clement v. City of Glendale, 518 F.3d 1090, 1093 \n6  (9th Cir. 2008). \n7  133.  Violation of city ordinances does not constitute a waiver of due process \n8  interests in a previously recognized property interest. \n9  134.  The property of those experiencing homelessness is โpropertyโ within the \n10  meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment, meaning a government entity โmust comport with \n11  the requirements of the Fourteenth Amendmentโs due process clause if it wishes to take and \n12  destroy them.โ Lavan, 693 F.3d at 1032. \n13  135.  Here, Defendants have engaged and will continue to engage in raids that \n14  targeted the unsheltered community living within the City. \n15  136.  Defendants employed these raids without adequate notice to Plaintiffs. \n16  137.  During  these  raids,  Defendants  seized  and  destroyed  Plaintiffsโ  property \n17  without affording them adequate notice their property would be seized or destroyed. \n18  138.  For Plaintiffs, this property is what they rely on for survival. It is all they have. \n19  Compared with that extremely high interest in their property, any administrative burden on \n20  the City to provide additional process to prevent erroneous deprivation is low. \n21  139.  Plaintiffsโ  property  was  not  seized  in  connection  with  prosecution  or \n22  investigation of any crime. \n23  140.  Defendants destroyed Plaintiffsโ property without affording them a post-\n24  deprivation process for challenging the seizure of their property. \n25  141.  It is clearly  established  Plaintiffs have a right to due process and post-\n26  deprivation hearings when their property is unlawfully seized and destroyed. \n27 \n28 \n \n4862-0321-1840   \n  - 17 - \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02041-GMS   Document 1   Filed 11/30/22   Page 18 of 24\n \n1  142.  A reasonable official in Chief Williams and Interim Chief Sullivansโ positions \n2  would have known that seizing and destroying property without due process of law violates \n3  the Fourteenth Amendment. \n4  143.  As  a  direct  and  proximate  cause  of  Defendantsโ  unconstitutional  acts, \n5  Plaintiffsโ property was seized and destroyed. \n6  144.  The acts of Defendants were intentional and deprived Plaintiffs of their rights, \n7  privileges, liberties, and immunities secured by the Constitution of the United States. \n8  Count Three \n9  (Eighth AmendmentโCruel & Unusual Punishment) \n10  (42 U.S.C. ยง 1983) \n11  (All Defendants) \n12  145.  Plaintiffs re-allege the foregoing paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n13  146.  The  Eighth  Amendment  to  the  United  States  Constitution  prohibits  the \n14  government from inflicting cruel and unusual punishment. \n15  147.  The Eighth Amendment โnot only limits the types of punishment that may be \n16  imposed and prohibits the imposition of punishment grossly disproportionate to the severity \n17  of the crime, but also โimposes substantive limits on what can be made criminal and \n18  punished as such.โโ Martin v. City of Boise, 920 F.3d 584, 613 (9th Cir. 2019) (quoting \n19  Ingraham v. Wright, 430 U.S. 651, 667 (1977)). \n20  148.  The Ninth Circuit has made clear that statutes prohibiting sleeping outside \n21  implicate the protections of the Eighth Amendment when applied to homeless individuals. \n22  Martin, 920 F.3d at 615; see also Johnson v. City of Grants Pass, 50 F.4th 787, 808โ812 \n23  (9th Cir. 2022). \n24  149.  Defendant City of Phoenix has enacted ordinances which directly target the \n25  act of sleeping by unsheltered individuals who otherwise have no place to sleep. \n26  150.  Phoenix City Code ยง 23-30(A) makes it unlawful for a person to camp within \n27  the City (the Camping Ban). \n28  151.  Phoenix City Code ยง 23-48.01 makes it unlawful for a person to sleep in any \n \n4862-0321-1840   \n  - 18 - \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02041-GMS   Document 1   Filed 11/30/22   Page 19 of 24\n \n1  right of way or sidewalk, even if those places are otherwise unoccupied (the Sleeping Ban). \n2  152.  The City commonly uses the Camping Ban, the Sleeping Ban, and other \n3  statutes against Plaintiffs to criminalize the act of being homeless and engaging in universal \n4  and unavoidable human activities such as sleeping. \n5  153.  Theses statutes and ordinances are enforced by Defendants. \n6  154.  Plaintiffs  have  been  cited  under  numerous  statutes  and  ordinances  by \n7  Defendants for the act of sleeping when they had nowhere else to go. \n8  155.  Defendants  commonly  cite  individuals  who  are  unsheltered  under  these \n9  statutes and ordinances, as well as others, during their raids (particularly during the raids \n10  conducted outside of the Zone, where there is less public visibility). \n11  156.  By criminalizing basic human activities such as sleeping, Defendants are \n12  knowingly  and  intentionally  violating  the  constitutional  rights  of  the  unsheltered \n13  community. \n14  157.  It is clearly established Plaintiffs cannot constitutionally be punished for \n15  sleeping in public spaces when indoor shelter is not practically available to them. \n16  158.  A reasonable official in Chief Williams and Interim Chief Sullivansโ positions \n17  would have known that enforcing these ordinances and statutes against the unsheltered \n18  population constituted a violation of their Eighth Amendment rights. \n19  159.  As  a  direct  and  proximate  cause  of  Defendantsโ  unconstitutional  acts, \n20  Plaintiffs have been deprived of the basic human right to sleep. \n21  160.  The acts of Defendants were intentional and deprived Plaintiffs of their rights, \n22  privileges, liberties, and immunities secured by the Constitution of the United States. \n23  Count Four \n24  (Municipal Liability under Monell) \n25  (All Defendants) \n26  161.  Plaintiffs re-allege the foregoing paragraphs as if fully set forth herein \n27  162.  Defendants were at all times relevant agents of the City vested with the power \n28  to control and supervise employees, agents, and contractors of the City. \n \n4862-0321-1840   \n  - 19 - \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02041-GMS   Document 1   Filed 11/30/22   Page 20 of 24\n \n1  163.  Upon information and belief, Defendants acted in execution of government \n2  policy or custom that may fairly be said to represent the official policy of the City. See \n3  Monell v. Depโt of Soc. Servs. of N.Y., 436 U.S. 658, 694 (1978). \n4  164.  Defendantsโ actions were authorized (before and during the fact) and ratified \n5  (after the fact) by final policymakers for the City. \n6  165.  Defendants directed every action of their agents, thereby causing the violation \n7  of Plaintiffsโ rights, and were deliberately indifferent to the fact that their directives would \n8  result in the violation of Plaintiffsโ rights. \n9  166.  Defendantsโ customs, policies, and/or practices, and the decisions of its final \n10  policymakers  were  the  moving  force  behind  Defendantsโ  violation  of  Plaintiffsโ \n11  constitutional rights. \n12  167.  Defendantsโ actions, as described herein, were motivated by malice and/or \n13  involved reckless or callous indifference to Plaintiffsโ federally protected constitutional \n14  rights. Defendants engaged in these actions and omissions intentionally, willfully, and/or \n15  wantonly, demonstrating deliberate indifference to, and a reckless disregard for, Plaintiffsโ \n16  constitutionally protected rights. \n17  168.  Defendants  have  or  should  have  policies,  procedures,  practices,  and/or \n18  customs to govern the raids to prevent the deprivations that occurred. Instead, of using the \n19  to penalize Plaintiffsโ unsheltered status and destroy Plaintiffsโ valued property. \n20  169.  Upon information and belief, Defendant City of Phoenix and the PPDโs \n21  policies, procedures, practices, and/or customs require agents or employees of the City to \n22  refrain from destroying unsheltered Plaintiffsโ possessions during such raids. \n23  170.  Upon information and belief, Defendants failed to train or supervise their \n24  employees when conducting raids of unsheltered populations such as Plaintiffs, resulting in \n25  the  criminalization  of  the  Plaintiffsโ  unsheltered  status  and  destruction  of  Plaintiffsโ \n26  property. \n27 \n28 \n \n4862-0321-1840   \n  - 20 - \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02041-GMS   Document 1   Filed 11/30/22   Page 21 of 24\n \n1  171.  As a direct and proximate result of Defendantsโ acts or omissions pursuant to \n2  official  government  policy,  Plaintiffs  suffered  (without  limitation)  a  deprivation  of \n3  constitutional rights. \n4  Count Five \n5  (Fourteenth AmendmentโState Created Danger) \n6  (All Defendants)  \n7  172.  Plaintiffs re-allege the foregoing paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n8  173.  The due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States \n9  Constitution prevents Defendants from placing Plaintiffs Ms. Kearn and Mr. Urban (and \n10  other unsheltered people served by Plaintiff FFE) in danger by acting with deliberate \n11  indifference to a known and obvious danger. \n12  174.  The Zone in downtown Phoenix occupies an area of concrete, asphalt, and \n13  rocks unprotected from the sun. \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23  175.  It extends nearly two blocks (approximately 500 feet). \n24  176.  During the summer, temperatures in this area can reach as high as 118ยบF. \n25  177.  Because  it is generally unprotected from the heat and  sun, hundreds of \n26  unsheltered individuals die from heat related exposure every summer in the Zone.23 \n \n27 \n23 See Anita Snow, Sweltering streets: Hundreds of homeless die in extreme heat across \nUS, FOX 10 PHX. (June 20, 2022), https://www.fox10phoenix.com/news/sweltering-\n28 \nstreets-hundreds-homeless-die-extreme-heat. \n \n4862-0321-1840   \n  - 21 - \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-02041-GMS   Document 1   Filed 11/30/22   Page 22 of 24\n \n1  178.  Defendants explicitly and implicitly send unsheltered individuals residing and \n2  living in the City into the Zone. \n3  179.  Defendants relax raids and enforcement of the Sleeping Ban in the Zone in \n4  order to encourage individuals to stay in the Zone. \n5  180.  Defendants actively transport unsheltered individuals into the Zone. \n6  181.  Defendants tell unsheltered individuals to go to the Zone. \n7  182.  Defendants have told both Plaintiffs Mr. Urban and Ms. Kearns to go to the \n8  Zone during encounters. \n9  183.  Defendants  push  people  into  the  Zone  despite  knowing  the  Zone  is \n10  unprotected from heat-related danger. \n11  184.  Defendants know about the increased heat related deaths in the Zone yet have \n12  done nothing to protect or provide any kind of shelter or shade to individuals in the Zone. \n13  185.  Because Defendants actively send unsheltered individuals residing and living \n14  in the City into the Zone all year-round, it is over-crowded. \n15  186.

The Court \n19  issues this abbreviated order in light of the Defendant Cityโs upcoming enhanced cleaning, \n20  which is scheduled to take place on Friday, December 16, 2022.  An order setting forth the \n21  Courtโs analysis of the partiesโ arguments and explaining the preliminary injunction below \n22  more fully will promptly issue, hereafter.  Nevertheless, though Plaintiffโs motion is \n23  granted in part, nothing in this Order or the forthcoming Order precludes the City from \n24  conducting its enhanced cleanup plans in the area referred to in the motions as โthe Zoneโ \n25  on December 16, 2022, pursuant to the Cityโs procedures and briefings as represented to \n26  the Court in this case.   \n27    Accordingly, \n28  IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Plaintiffsโ Motion for Preliminary Injunction \n \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-02041-GMS   Document 32   Filed 12/15/22   Page 2 of 2\n \n \n \n1  (Doc. 2) is granted in part and denied in part. \n2  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED granting that the City, its agents and employees, are \n3  preliminarily enjoined from doing any of the following: \n4  1.

Seizing  any  property  of  the  unsheltered  without  providing  prior  notice  at  the \n8  propertyโs location that the property will be seized, unless the agent or employee \n9  has  an  objectively  reasonable  belief  that  it  is  (a)  abandoned,  (b)  presents  an \n10  immediate  threat  to  public  health  or  safety,  or  (c)  is  evidence  of  a  crime  or \n11  contraband; and \n12  3.  Absent an immediate threat to public health or safety, destroying said property \n13  without maintaining it in a secure location for a period of less than 30 days. \n14  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that if property is seized pursuant to a belief that it \n15  was abandoned or after the City provides notice that it intends to seize the property, the \n16  City, its agents and employees, are further required to provide a notice at the location from \n17  which the property was seized, calculated to be readily seen by any owner of the property, \n18  describing how and where to retrieve the property and the deadline for retrieving it. \n19  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the Motion for Leave to File amicus brief by \n20  Freddy Brown (Doc. 31) is granted. \n21    Dated this 15th day of December, 2022. \n \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n \n- 2 - ",

Enforcing the Camping and Sleeping Bans against individuals who \n22  practically cannot obtain shelter as long as there are more unsheltered \n23  individuals in Phoenix than there are shelter beds available; \n24  2.

Absent an immediate threat to public health or safety, destroying said \n2  property without maintaining it in a secure location for a period of less \n3  than 30 days. \n4  (Doc. 34 at 19.) \n5  Very recently, the Ninth Circuitโs amended decision, Johnson v. City of Grants \n6  Pass,  72  F.4th  868  (9th  Cir.  2023),  clarified  the  beds-versus-population  formula \n7  established in Martin on which the Court relied on in entering the preliminary injunction.  \n8  See Martin v. City of Boise, 920 F.3d 584, 617 (9th Cir. 2019) (โWe hold only that โso long \n9  as there is a greater number of homeless individuals in [a jurisdiction] than the number of \n10  available beds [in shelters],โ the jurisdiction cannot prosecute homeless individuals for \n11  โinvoluntarily sitting,  lying, and sleeping in public.โโ) (quoting  Jones v. City of  Los \n12  Angeles, 444 F.3d 1118, 1138 (9th Cir. 2006), vacated, 505 F.3d 1006 (9th Cir. 2007)) \n13  (alteration in original); see also Johnson v. City of Grants Pass, 50 F.4th 787, 795 (9th Cir. \n14  2022), superseded, 72 F.4th 868 (9th Cir. 2023) (quoting the Martin formula); (Doc. 34 at \n15  6).  The Ninth Circuitโs amended decision replaced the formula expressed in Martin with \n16  the following: โPursuant to Martin, it is an Eighth Amendment violation to criminally \n17  punish involuntarily homeless persons for sleeping in public if there are no other public \n18  areas or appropriate shelters where those individuals can sleep.โ  Johnson v. City of Grants \n19  Pass, 72 F.4th 868, 877 (9th Cir. 2023). In footnote 33 of the amended decision, the Ninth \n20  Circuit declined to โdecide whether alternate outdoor space would be sufficient under \n21  Martinโ because โthe City ha[d] not established any realistically available place within the \n22  jurisdiction for involuntarily homeless individuals to sleep.โ  Johnson, 72 F.4th at 894 n.33.   \n23  The portions of the Courtโs Order that enjoins the City from violating the Fourth \n24  and Fourteenth Amendments remains the same.  See (Doc. 34 at 7โ14, 19); see also \n25  Johnson, 72 F.4th at 881(finding โit is unnecessary to decide [the p]laintiffsโ procedural \n26  due process claimโ). \n27  IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Defendantsโ Motion to Modify Preliminary \n28  Injunction (Doc. 109) is GRANTED in part and DENIED in part.  It is granted in part \n \n- 2 - \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-02041-GMS   Document 119   Filed 10/17/23   Page 3 of 3\n \n \n \n1  with respect to the City: its agents and employees, are preliminarily enjoined from doing \n2  any of the following: \n3  1.  Enforcing  the  Camping  and  Sleeping  Bans  against  involuntarily \n4  homeless persons for sleeping in public if there are no other public \n5  areas or appropriate shelters where those individuals can sleep; \n6  2.  Seizing any property of the unsheltered without providing prior notice \n7  at the propertyโs location that the property will be seized, unless the \n8  agent or employee has an objectively reasonable belief that it is (a) \n9  abandoned, (b) presents an immediate threat to public health or safety, \n10  or (c) is evidence of a crime or contraband; and \n11  3.  Absent an immediate threat to public health or safety, destroying said \n12  property without maintaining it in a secure location for a period of less \n13  than 30 days. \n14  The Motion is denied on all other grounds. \n15  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that if property is seized pursuant to a belief that it \n16  was abandoned or after the City provides notice that it intends to seize the property, the \n17  City, its agents and employees, are further required to provide a notice at the location from \n18  which the property was seized, calculated to be readily seen by any owner of the property, \n19  describing how and where to retrieve the property and the deadline for retrieving it. \n20  IT  IS  FURTHER  ORDERED  finding  Defendantsโ  Motion  for  Expedited \n21  Consideration and Emergency Status Conference (Doc. 109) moot. \n22    Dated this 17th day of October, 2023. \n \n23 \n \n24 \n \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n \n- 3 - ",
