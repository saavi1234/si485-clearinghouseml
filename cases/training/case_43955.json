The new deadlines are set as follows: Expert Testimony from plaintiff due by 6/15/22 - from defendant due 8/16/22; Discovery due by 10/17/2022; Dispositive Motions due by 11/30/2022; Joint Status Report due by 9/16/2022. The parties shall be ready for trial in July 2023 to be scheduled by separate order. No further extensions will be granted in this action absent extraordinary circumstances. Signed by Judge Annemarie Carney Axon on 3/4/22. (SAC) (Entered: 03/04/2022)"

    "summary": "<p>On December 1, 2020, the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama against the Ashland, Alabama Housing Authority, alleging that it had engaged in a pattern or practice of discrimination on the basis of race at multiple low-income public housing communities in violation of the Fair Housing Act. The complaint alleged that the Ashland Housing Authority, and three property development companies who were the private owners and agent of two of the properties in question, unlawfully steered Black applicants away from four overwhelmingly white properties and steered white applicants away from disproportionately Black properties, maintaining the properties as largely segregated. The case was assigned to Judge Annemarie Carney Axon. The DOJ filed an amended complaint on January 25, 2021, correcting minor factual details.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The Ashland Housing Authority and the corporate defendants moved to dismiss the case, or in the alternative, moved for a more definite statement on February 8 and 9, 2021, respectively. The defendants argued that the DOJ failed to state a claim and that the amended complaint was too vague to provide them with notice of the claims against them. Additionally, the Ashland Housing Authority moved for sanctions on March 2, 2021, alleging that the DOJ brought a frivolous lawsuit. On May 12, 2021, the court denied the defendants&rsquo; motions, holding that the DOJ alleged sufficient facts to state a claim under the Fair Housing Act. The court also found that no more definite statement was necessary.</p>\r\n<p>On September 16, 2022, the court issued a mediation order, after the filing of a status report and approximately a year of discovery. On November 15, 2022, the parties filed a joint status report following mediation and moved to extend the dispositive motion deadline to November 30, 2022, to allow for the parties to finalize and file a proposed consent decree resolving all claims.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On December 13, 2022, the court entered a consent decree containing several requirements for the defendants:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>pay $275,000 in damages to 23 current or former tenants who were allegedly harmed by the defendants&rsquo; conduct;</li>\r\n<li>pay a $10,000 civil penalty to the United States;</li>\r\n<li>implement policies and procedures to remedy the alleged segregation and to ensure nondiscrimination, transparency, and consistency in processing applications and offering units to applicants;</li>\r\n<li>contact a group of approximately 145 individuals who were disproportionately Black who applied to two overwhelmingly white properties but were not placed on the waiting lists for those properties, and offer them spots on the waiting list based on their original dates of application, if they still qualified;</li>\r\n<li>undergo fair-housing training; and</li>\r\n<li>submit periodic compliance reports to the DOJ.&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>The parties agreed that the consent decree would remain in effect as to each defendant for a period of 21 months from the date on which that defendant paid its portion of the settlement fund. The court retained jurisdiction to enforce the terms of the consent decree.</p>",

Its address is 44 Market Plaza, \nSuite 801, Montgomery, AL 36104. \nB. AHA’s Seven Housing Communities  \n8.  Beginning in approximately 1958, AHA developed six public housing \ncommunities in Ashland, eventually containing 199 units, which it continues to \nown, operate, and manage as public housing today.  These units are federally \nsubsidized under the United States Housing Act of 1937, 42 U.S.C. § 1437 et seq., \nand/or through the Rental Assistance Demonstration program under the \nConsolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2012, Pub. Law 112-55, \n125 Stat. 673-74, as amended.  AHA’s public housing communities are known as \nEast Side, West Side, North Side, Runyon Court, Pine View, and Clay Circle.   \n9.  AHA established its public housing in 1958 as a dual system of public \nhousing segregated by race.  At or around that time, East Side (located on the \nsoutheast side of Ashland) was developed as the “white” community, West Side \n(located on the northwest side of Ashland) was developed as the “colored” \ncommunity for “non-whites.”  AHA subsequently expanded East Side and West \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01905-ACA   Document 9   Filed 01/25/21   Page 4 of 17\nSide and developed the four additional public housing communities, which did not \nhave racial designations when they opened.       \n10.  Since approximately the early 1980s, AHA has managed a seventh \nlow-income housing community in Ashland known as Ashland Heights, which is \nfederally subsidized under the United States Housing Act of 1937, 42 U.S.C. § \n1437 et seq. and the Housing Act of 1949, 42 U.S.C. § 1441 et seq.  Ashland \nHeights is a 56-unit community consisting of two developments, Ashland Heights I \nand Ashland Heights II. \n11.  As explained below, the residents of East Side, Clay Circle, and \nAshland Heights are disproportionately and overwhelmingly White, and the \nresidents of West Side and Pine View are disproportionately Black.  These housing \ncommunities are located in areas of Ashland with racial demographics that \nresemble those of the housing communities.  Based on 2010 Census Bureau data, \nEast Side, Clay Circle, and Ashland Heights are located in the far south and east \nsections of Ashland in Census block groups that are over 80% White.  By contrast, \nPine View and West Side are located on the opposite side of town, in the far north \nand west sections of Ashland in Census block groups that are over 60% Black.  \nThe disproportionately Black communities are geographically separated from the \ndisproportionately and overwhelmingly White communities by over a mile, across \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01905-ACA   Document 9   Filed 01/25/21   Page 5 of 17\nthe centrally located downtown town square area, as well as by two parallel north-\nsouth thoroughfares (Alabama State Route 77 and Highway 9) and the main east-\nwest thoroughfare (1st Avenue).   \n12.    The seven housing communities described above, including the units \ncontained therein, are “dwellings” within the meaning of the Fair Housing Act, 42 \nU.S.C. § 3602(b). \n13.  Tenant eligibility for any unit in these seven housing communities \nmanaged by AHA is limited to low-income tenants.  \n14.  In addition, some of AHA’s units are designated as “elderly” or \n“disabled” units.  East Side has 59 units, of which 16 are designated elderly.  Clay \nCircle has 21 units, of which 19 are designated elderly and 2 are designated \ndisabled.  Ashland Heights has 56 units, of which 25 are designated elderly and 3 \nare designated disabled.  North Side has 36 units, of which 20 are designated \nelderly.  Runyon Court has 21 units, all of which are designated elderly.  West Side \nhas 38 units, of which 7 are designated elderly.  Pine View has 24 units, of which 1 \nis designated disabled.     \n   \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01905-ACA   Document 9   Filed 01/25/21   Page 6 of 17\nC. AHA Maintains Racially Segregated Housing Communities \n15.  From at least 2012 to the present, AHA has engaged in a pattern or \npractice of race discrimination by steering applicants to housing communities \nbased on race and by maintaining a racially segregated housing program. \n16.  Analyses of tenant assignment and occupancy data provided to the \nUnited States by AHA show that since at least 2012, tenants at five of AHA’s \nseven communities – East Side, Ashland Heights, Clay Circle, West Side, and Pine \nView – have lived in housing communities that were disproportionately of one race \nand that AHA has been assigning tenants to these housing communities based on \nrace.   \n17.  Since at least 2012, Ashland Heights, Clay Circle, and East Side have \nbeen disproportionately and overwhelmingly occupied by White tenants and at \npercentages that are higher than would be expected at these communities if \nassignments were not based on race.  For example, as of June 2018, 69% of all \nAHA tenants were White but 99% of tenants at Ashland Heights were White, 92% \nof tenants at East Side were White, and 91% of tenants at Clay Circle were White.      \n18.  Similarly, since at least 2012, West Side and Pine View have been \ndisproportionately occupied by Black tenants at percentages that are higher than \nwould be expected at these communities if assignments were not based on race.  \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01905-ACA   Document 9   Filed 01/25/21   Page 7 of 17\nFor example, as of June 2018, approximately 30% of all AHA tenants were Black, \nbut 73% of tenants at West Side were Black and 65% of tenants at Pine View were \nBlack.  \nD. Racial Segregation at AHA Cannot Be Explained by Non-\nDiscriminatory Factors \n \n19.   The degree of racial disparities described above at these five \ncommunities is statistically significant and cannot be explained by non-racial \nfactors, such as a potential correlation between race and elderly or disabled status \nor between race and number of bedrooms or household size.   \n20.  For example, between 2012 to 2018,Black elderly or disabled tenants \n \nwere assigned to and lived at AHA’s disproportionately Black communities and \nWhite elderly or disabled tenants were assigned to and lived at the \ndisproportionately and overwhelmingly White communities in a manner that \ndeparts from what would be expected if housing assignments were not based on \nrace.     \n21.  For another example, Black tenants are disproportionately housed at \nthe disproportionately Black communities as compared to White tenants living in \nthe same bedroom-size unit; and White tenants are disproportionately housed at the \ndisproportionately and overwhelmingly White communities as compared to Black \ntenants living in the same bedroom-size unit.     \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01905-ACA   Document 9   Filed 01/25/21   Page 8 of 17\n22.  AHA’s recent assignments of applicants and tenants perpetuate the \nsegregation at its housing communities described above.  Tenant move-in records \nand other data show that from at least 2012 through 2018, AHA assigned Black \napplicants to its disproportionately Black communities and White applicants to its \ndisproportionately and overwhelmingly White communities in a manner that \ndeparts substantially from a neutral, non-discriminatory norm.   \n23.  Specifically, between approximately January 1, 2012, through May \n16, 2018, AHA filled over 230 vacancies.  AHA assigned White applicants to East \nSide, Clay Circle, and Ashland Heights and assigned Black applicants to West Side \nand Pine View in percentages that were much higher than would be expected if \nhousing assignments were not based on race.   \n24.  Although 76% of all vacancies at AHA filled by applicants for public \nhousing were filled by White heads of household (“White households”) between \n2012 and 2018, 95% of vacancies at East Side and 96% of those at Clay Circle \nwere filled by White households.  And all or nearly all the vacancies at Ashland \nHeights during this time were filled by White households.  Similarly, although \n24% of all vacancies at AHA filled by applicants for public housing were filled by \nBlack heads of household (“Black households”) during this time, more than twice \nthat – 56% of vacancies at West Side and 57% at Pine View – were filled by Black \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01905-ACA   Document 9   Filed 01/25/21   Page 9 of 17\nhouseholds.  These disparities in housing assignments are statistically significant \nand cannot be explained by non-discriminatory factors.  \nE. AHA Has Intentionally Denied Black Applicants the Opportunity to \nLive at its Disproportionately and Overwhelmingly White Communities \nand Denied White Applicants the Opportunity to Live at its \nDisproportionately Black Communities    \n \n25.  The racial segregation and disparities described above are a direct \nresult of AHA’s current policies and practices, which deny applicants and tenants \nthe opportunity to live in particular housing communities based on race.  These \ninclude AHA’s failure to consistently apply its Admissions and Continued \nOccupancy Policy (“ACOP”) and its failure to discuss the nearly all-White \nAshland Heights community as an option with prospective Black tenants. \n26.  Adopted by AHA, the ACOP is the policy document that governs \nadmissions and occupancy of the public housing units administered by AHA. \n27.  Among its provisions, the ACOP requires that AHA make public \nhousing assignments from a centralized waiting list maintained by bedroom size in \nthe order in which households applied, with certain preferences for elderly or \ndisabled applicants, and without regard to tenant preference for a particular \nlocation.  Instead of following the ACOP, however, between at least 2012 and \n2018, AHA followed a practice of disproportionately assigning White households \nto the disproportionately and overwhelmingly White communities of East Side and \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01905-ACA   Document 9   Filed 01/25/21   Page 10 of 17\nClay Circle, while disproportionately assigning Black households to the \ndisproportionately Black communities of West Side and Pine View.   \n28.  The ACOP also requires AHA to follow a “one-offer system” in \noffering applicants housing units.  Under this system, if an applicant receives an \noffer for a unit and declines the offer without “good cause,” AHA must place him \nor her at the bottom of the waitlist.  The ACOP states that the purpose of the one-\noffer system is to prevent discrimination on the basis of race or other grounds.  \nInstead of following the ACOP, however, AHA has followed a practice of \nallowing applicants to decline offers of units without showing good cause and then \nnot moving the applicant to the bottom of the waitlist.  In at least one case, AHA \ndid this even when the applicant explicitly informed AHA its reason for declining \nthe offer was based on not wanting to live near other residents because of their race \nor national origin.    \n29.  AHA maintains waiting lists for Ashland Heights I and Ashland \nHeights II that are separate from the centralized public housing waiting list for the \npublic housing properties.   \n30.  The owners of Ashland Heights submit Affirmative Fair Housing \nMarketing Plans for Ashland Heights to HUD every three years.  The 2011, 2014, \nand 2017 Affirmative Fair Housing Marketing Plans self-reported that Ashland \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01905-ACA   Document 9   Filed 01/25/21   Page 11 of 17\nHeights and its waitlists were all-White or nearly all-White, and that Blacks were \none of the groups “least likely to apply [to Ashland Heights] without special \noutreach efforts.”  Of the total 74 applicants for Ashland Heights II between 2011 \nand 2018, not one was Black. \n31.  Applicants for housing at one of AHA’s communities must complete \nthe AHA application form, which contains separate check-boxes, one for \n“PUBLIC HOUSING” and one each for “Ashland Heights I (Sec 8 New Const)” \nand “Ashland Heights II (FmHA 515 Elderly).”  Applicants must also undergo an \nin-person interview with one of AHA’s staff members.  AHA has a practice of \nchoosing not to discuss with Black applicants that they have the option to apply to \nboth public housing and Ashland Heights, despite knowing that Ashland Heights \nand its waitlist have been all-White or nearly all-White for years and despite that it \nhas the opportunity to do so during this in-person interview.   \n32.  Because Ashland Heights has been all-White or nearly all-White for \nyears, AHA’s failure to discuss Ashland Heights with applicants harms Black \napplicants, who are unlikely to apply for available units at Ashland Heights.   \n33.  According to HUD’s “Implementing Affirmative Fair Housing \nMarketing Requirements” Handbook, Handbook 8025.1 REV-2, Ch. 4, HUD \nrequires that the owner and its agents conduct outreach to specific groups who may \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01905-ACA   Document 9   Filed 01/25/21   Page 12 of 17\nbe unlikely to apply.  Yet AHA has failed to do so here with Black applicants, \ndespite that the Ashland Heights owners acknowledge that Black applicants are \nleast likely to apply to Ashland Heights.   \n34.  Moreover, between at least 2012 and 2017, AHA assigned multiple \n(non-elderly, non-disabled) White applicants ahead of comparable Black applicants \nto units at disproportionately and overwhelmingly White communities, even \nthough Black applicants had higher positions on the waiting list.  Similarly, in \nfilling vacancies at disproportionately Black communities, AHA assigned multiple \n(non-elderly, non-disabled) Black applicants ahead of comparable White \napplicants, even though White applicants had higher positions on the waiting list.   \nF. AHA Engaged in Discriminatory Conduct Regarding Ashland Heights \nWhile Acting as the Agent of Defendants Southern Development \nCompany of Ashland, Ltd., Southern Development Company of \nAshland #2, Ltd., and Southern Development Company, LLC. \n \n35.  At all times relevant to the allegations in this lawsuit, AHA’s conduct \nconcerning Ashland Heights was performed in its role as manager of Ashland \nHeights and agent of Southern Development Company of Ashland, Ltd., Southern \nDevelopment Company of Ashland #2, Ltd., and Southern Development Company, \nLLC, and AHA acted within the scope of its agency while engaging in the conduct \ndescribed herein.   \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01905-ACA   Document 9   Filed 01/25/21   Page 13 of 17\n36.  Defendants Southern Development Company of Ashland, Ltd. and \nSouthern Development Company of Ashland #2, Ltd., as owners of Ashland \nHeights, are liable for the conduct of their agents.   \n37.  Defendant Southern Development Company, LLC, as agent for \nSouthern Development Company of Ashland, Ltd. and Southern Development \nCompany of Ashland #2, Ltd., is responsible for renting the units at Ashland \nHeights I and Ashland Heights II, and is liable for the conduct of its agents.   \nG. AHA’s Conduct Violates the Fair Housing Act \n38.  The allegations set forth above are hereby re-alleged and incorporated \nby reference.   \n39.  Through its discriminatory policies and practices described above, \nAHA has harmed applicants and tenants.  AHA has done so by:   \na.  offering and assigning tenants to units in segregated housing based \non the race of the applicants; \nb.  skipping qualified Black applicants on the waiting list to fill \nvacancies at disproportionately and overwhelmingly White \ncommunities with later-applying White applicants, thereby \ndelaying or denying Black applicants housing and further \nsegregating AHA’s housing;  \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01905-ACA   Document 9   Filed 01/25/21   Page 14 of 17\nc.  skipping qualified White applicants on the waiting list to fill \nvacancies at disproportionately Black communities with later-\napplying Black applicants, thereby delaying or denying White \napplicants housing and further segregating AHA’s housing;  \nd.  allowing applicants who decline offers of housing without showing \ngood cause, even when they decline offers for race-based reasons, \nto maintain their position on the waiting list, thereby violating the \nACOP’s one-offer system requirement intended to prevent race \ndiscrimination; and  \ne.  failing to discuss Ashland Heights with Black applicants or \nconduct required outreach to prospective Black tenants about \nAshland Heights.    \n40.  By engaging in the conduct described above, the defendants have: (a) \nrefused to rent, refused to negotiate for the rental of, and otherwise made \nunavailable or denied dwellings to persons because of race or color, in violation of \n42 U.S.C. § 3604(a); and (b) discriminated in the terms, conditions, or privileges of \nrental of dwellings on the basis of race or color, in violation of 42 U.S.C. § \n3604(b). \n   \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01905-ACA   Document 9   Filed 01/25/21   Page 15 of 17\n41.  The conduct of defendants constitutes:   \na.  A pattern or practice of resistance to the full enjoyment of rights \nsecured by the Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. § 3601 et seq.; and  \nb.  A denial to a group of persons of rights granted by the Fair \nHousing Act, 42 U.S.C. § 3601 et seq., which denial raises an issue \nof general public importance. \n42.  Individuals who were subjected to defendants’ discriminatory housing \npractices are aggrieved persons as defined by the Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. § \n3602(i), and have suffered actual injury and damages as a result of defendants’ \nconduct as described above. \n43.  Defendants’ conduct described above was intentional, willful, and \ntaken with disregard for the rights of others. \nClaim for Relief \nWHEREFORE, the United States asks that the Court enter an order that: \nA.  Declares that defendants’ policies and practices, as alleged herein, \nviolate the Fair Housing Act, as amended, 42 U.S.C. § 3601 et seq.; \nB.  Enjoins defendants, their agents, employees, and successors, and all \nothers in active concert or participation with them, from discriminating on account \nof race or color against any person in any aspect of the rental of a dwelling; \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01905-ACA   Document 9   Filed 01/25/21   Page 16 of 17\nC.  Requires defendants to take all necessary and appropriate affirmative \nsteps to correct, to the extent practicable, the continuing effects of their past and \npresent discriminatory practices; \nD.  Requires such action by defendants as may be necessary to restore, as \nnearly as practicable, all persons aggrieved by defendants’ discriminatory housing \npractices to the position these persons would have occupied but for defendants’ \ndiscriminatory conduct;  \nE.  Awards monetary damages to each person aggrieved by defendants’ \ndiscriminatory housing practices, in accordance with 42 U.S.C. § 3614(d)(1)(B); \nand \nF.  Assesses a civil penalty against each defendant in an amount \nauthorized by 42 U.S.C. § 3614(d)(1)(C), to vindicate the public interest. \n  The United States further prays for such additional relief as the interests of \njustice may require.   \n \nJURY TRIAL DEMANDED. \n \n   \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01905-ACA   Document 9   Filed 01/25/21   Page 17 of 17\nDated: January 25, 2021         \n              MONTY WILKINSON   \n              Acting Attorney General \n               \nPRIM F.

Defendant Southern Development Company, LLC is a limited liability \ncorporation based in Montgomery, Alabama, and is under contract to act as the \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01905-ACA   Document 1   Filed 12/01/20   Page 3 of 17\nagent for Defendants Southern Development Company of Ashland, Ltd. and \nSouthern Development Company of Ashland #2, Ltd., respectively, to rent the \nunits at Ashland Heights I and Ashland Heights II.  Its address is 44 Market Plaza, \nSuite 801, Montgomery, AL 36104. \nB. AHA’s Seven Housing Communities  \n8.  Beginning in approximately 1958, AHA developed six public housing \ncommunities in Ashland, eventually containing 199 units, which it continues to \nown, operate, and manage as public housing today.  These units are federally \nsubsidized under the United States Housing Act of 1937, 42 U.S.C. § 1437 et seq., \nand/or through the Rental Assistance Demonstration program under the \nConsolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2012, Pub. Law 112-55, \n125 Stat. 673-74, as amended.  AHA’s public housing communities are known as \nEast Side, West Side, North Side, Runyon Court, Pine View, and Clay Circle.   \n9.  AHA established its public housing in 1958 as a dual system of public \nhousing segregated by race.  At or around that time, East Side (located on the \nsoutheast side of Ashland) was developed as the “white” community, West Side \n(located on the northwest side of Ashland) was developed as the “colored” \ncommunity for “non-whites.”  AHA subsequently expanded East Side and West \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01905-ACA   Document 1   Filed 12/01/20   Page 4 of 17\nSide and developed the four additional public housing communities, which did not \nhave racial designations when they opened.       \n10.  Since approximately the early 1980s, AHA has managed a seventh \nlow-income housing community in Ashland known as Ashland Heights, which is \nfederally subsidized under the United States Housing Act of 1937, 42 U.S.C. § \n1437 et seq. and the Housing Act of 1949, 42 U.S.C. § 1441 et seq.  Ashland \nHeights is a 56-unit community consisting of two developments, Ashland Heights I \nand Ashland Heights II. \n11.  As explained below, the residents of East Side, Clay Circle, and \nAshland Heights are disproportionately and overwhelmingly White, and the \nresidents of West Side and Pine View are disproportionately Black.  These housing \ncommunities are located in areas of Ashland with racial demographics that \nresemble those of the housing communities.  Based on 2010 Census Bureau data, \nEast Side, Clay Circle, and Ashland Heights are located in the far south and east \nsections of Ashland in Census block groups that are over 80% White.  By contrast, \nPine View and West Side are located on the opposite side of town, in the far north \nand west sections of Ashland in Census block groups that are over 60% Black.  \nThe disproportionately Black communities are geographically separated from the \ndisproportionately and overwhelmingly White communities by over a mile, across \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01905-ACA   Document 1   Filed 12/01/20   Page 5 of 17\nthe centrally located downtown town square area, as well as by two parallel north-\nsouth thoroughfares (Alabama State Route 77 and Highway 9) and the main east-\nwest thoroughfare (1st Avenue).   \n12.    The seven housing communities described above, including the units \ncontained therein, are “dwellings” within the meaning of the Fair Housing Act, 42 \nU.S.C. § 3602(b). \n13.  Tenant eligibility for any unit in these seven housing communities \nmanaged by AHA is limited to low-income tenants.  \n14.  In addition, some of AHA’s units are designated as “elderly” or \n“disabled” units.  East Side has 59 units, of which 16 are designated elderly.  Clay \nCircle has 21 units, of which 19 are designated elderly and 2 are designated \ndisabled.  Ashland Heights has 56 units, of which 25 are designated elderly and 3 \nare designated disabled.  North Side has 36 units, of which 20 are designated \nelderly.  Runyon Court has 21 units, all of which are designated elderly.  West Side \nhas 38 units, of which 7 are designated elderly.  Pine View has 24 units, of which 1 \nis designated disabled.     \nC. AHA Maintains Racially Segregated Housing Communities \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01905-ACA   Document 1   Filed 12/01/20   Page 6 of 17\n15.  From at least 2012 to the present, AHA has engaged in a pattern or \npractice of race discrimination by steering applicants to housing communities \nbased on race and by maintaining a racially segregated housing program. \n16.  Analyses of tenant assignment and occupancy data provided to the \nUnited States by AHA show that since at least 2012, tenants at five of AHA’s \nseven communities – East Side, Ashland Heights, Clay Circle, West Side, and Pine \nView – have lived in housing communities that were disproportionately of one race \nand that AHA has been assigning tenants to these housing communities based on \nrace.   \n17.  Since at least 2012, Ashland Heights, Clay Circle, and East Side have \nbeen disproportionately and overwhelmingly occupied by White tenants and at \npercentages that are higher than would be expected at these communities if \nassignments were not based on race.  For example, as of June 2018, 69% of all \nAHA tenants were White but 99% of tenants at Ashland Heights were White, 92% \nof tenants at East Side were White, and 91% of tenants at Clay Circle were White.      \n18.  Similarly, since at least 2012, West Side and Pine View have been \ndisproportionately occupied by Black tenants at percentages that are higher than \nwould be expected at these communities if assignments were not based on race.  \nFor example, as of June 2018, approximately 30% of all AHA tenants were Black, \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01905-ACA   Document 1   Filed 12/01/20   Page 7 of 17\nbut 73% of tenants at West Side were Black and 65% of tenants at Pine View were \nBlack.  \nD. Racial Segregation at AHA Cannot Be Explained by Non-\nDiscriminatory Factors \n \n19.   The degree of racial disparities described above at these five \ncommunities is statistically significant and cannot be explained by non-racial \nfactors, such as a potential correlation between race and elderly or disabled status \nor between race and number of bedrooms or household size.   \n20.  For example, between 2012 to 2018, Black elderly or disabled tenants \nwere assigned to and lived at AHA’s disproportionately Black communities and \nWhite elderly or disabled tenants were assigned to and lived at the \ndisproportionately and overwhelmingly White communities in a manner that \ndeparts from what would be expected if housing assignments were not based on \nrace.     \n21.  For another example, Black tenants are disproportionately housed at \nthe disproportionately Black communities as compared to White tenants living in \nthe same bedroom-size unit; and White tenants are disproportionately housed at the \ndisproportionately and overwhelmingly White communities as compared to Black \ntenants living in the same bedroom-size unit.     \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01905-ACA   Document 1   Filed 12/01/20   Page 8 of 17\n22.  AHA’s recent assignments of applicants and tenants perpetuate the \nsegregation at its housing communities described above.  Tenant move-in records \nand other data show that from at least 2012 through 2018, AHA assigned Black \napplicants to its disproportionately Black communities and White applicants to its \ndisproportionately and overwhelmingly White communities in a manner that \ndeparts substantially from a neutral, non-discriminatory norm.   \n23.  Specifically, between approximately January 1, 2012, through May \n16, 2018, AHA filled over 230 vacancies.  AHA assigned White applicants to East \nSide, Clay Circle, and Ashland Heights and assigned Black applicants to West Side \nand Pine View in percentages that were much higher than would be expected if \nhousing assignments were not based on race.   \n24.  Although 76% of all vacancies at AHA filled by applicants for public \nhousing were filled by White heads of household (“White households”) between \n2012 and 2018, 95% of vacancies at East Side and 96% of those at Clay Circle \nwere filled by White households.  And all or nearly all the vacancies at Ashland \nHeights during this time were filled by White households.  Similarly, although \n24% of all vacancies at AHA filled by applicants for public housing were filled by \nBlack heads of household (“Black households”) during this time, more than twice \nthat – 56% of vacancies at West Side and 57% at Pine View – were filled by Black \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01905-ACA   Document 1   Filed 12/01/20   Page 9 of 17\nhouseholds.  These disparities in housing assignments are statistically significant \nand cannot be explained by non-discriminatory factors.  \nE. AHA Has Intentionally Denied Black Applicants the Opportunity to \nLive at its Disproportionately and Overwhelmingly White Communities \nand Denied White Applicants the Opportunity to Live at its \nDisproportionately Black Communities    \n \n25.  The racial segregation and disparities described above are a direct \nresult of AHA’s current policies and practices, which deny applicants and tenants \nthe opportunity to live in particular housing communities based on race.  These \ninclude AHA’s failure to consistently apply its Admissions and Continued \nOccupancy Policy (“ACOP”) and its failure to discuss the nearly all-White \nAshland Heights community as an option with prospective Black tenants. \n26.  Adopted by AHA, the ACOP is the policy document that governs \nadmissions and occupancy of the public housing units administered by AHA. \n27.  Among its provisions, the ACOP requires that AHA make public \nhousing assignments from a centralized waiting list maintained by bedroom size in \nthe order in which households applied, with certain preferences for elderly or \ndisabled applicants, and without regard to tenant preference for a particular \nlocation.  Instead of following the ACOP, however, between at least 2012 and \n2018, AHA followed a practice of disproportionately assigning White households \nto the disproportionately and overwhelmingly White communities of East Side, \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01905-ACA   Document 1   Filed 12/01/20   Page 10 of 17\nAshland Heights and Clay Circle, while disproportionately assigning Black \nhouseholds to the disproportionately Black communities of West Side and Pine \nView.   \n28.  The ACOP also requires AHA to follow a “one-offer system” in \noffering applicants housing units.  Under this system, if an applicant receives an \noffer for a unit and declines the offer without “good cause,” AHA must place him \nor her at the bottom of the waitlist.  The ACOP states that the purpose of the one-\noffer system is to prevent discrimination on the basis of race or other grounds.  \nInstead of following the ACOP, however, AHA has followed a practice of \nallowing applicants to decline offers of units without showing good cause and then \nnot moving the applicant to the bottom of the waitlist.  In at least one case, AHA \ndid this even when the applicant explicitly informed AHA its reason for declining \nthe offer was based on not wanting to live near other residents because of their race \nor national origin.    \n29.  AHA maintains waiting lists for Ashland Heights I and Ashland \nHeights II that are separate from the centralized public housing waiting list for the \npublic housing properties.   \n30.  The owners of Ashland Heights submit Affirmative Fair Housing \nMarketing Plans for Ashland Heights to HUD every three years.  The 2011, 2014, \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01905-ACA   Document 1   Filed 12/01/20   Page 11 of 17\nand 2017 Affirmative Fair Housing Marketing Plans self-reported that Ashland \nHeights and its waitlists were all-White or nearly all-White, and that Blacks were \none of the groups “least likely to apply [to Ashland Heights] without special \noutreach efforts.”  Of the total 74 applicants for Ashland Heights II between 2011 \nand 2018, not one was Black. \n31.  Applicants for housing at one of AHA’s communities must complete \nthe AHA application form, which contains separate check-boxes, one for \n“PUBLIC HOUSING” and one each for “Ashland Heights I (Sec 8 New Const)” \nand “Ashland Heights II (FmHA 515 Elderly).”  Applicants must also undergo an \nin-person interview with one of AHA’s staff members.  AHA has a practice of \nchoosing not to discuss with Black applicants that they have the option to apply to \nboth public housing and Ashland Heights, despite knowing that Ashland Heights \nand its waitlist have been all-White or nearly all-White for years and despite that it \nhas the opportunity to do so during this in-person interview.   \n32.  Because Ashland Heights has been all-White or nearly all-White for \nyears, AHA’s maintenance of a separate waiting list and failure to discuss Ashland \nHeights with applicants harm Black applicants, who are unlikely to know about \nand apply for available units at Ashland Heights.   \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01905-ACA   Document 1   Filed 12/01/20   Page 12 of 17\n33.  According to HUD’s “Implementing Affirmative Fair Housing \nMarketing Requirements” Handbook, Handbook 8025.1 REV-2, Ch. 4, HUD \nrequires that the owner and its agents conduct outreach to specific groups who may \nbe unlikely to apply.  Yet AHA has failed to do so here with Black applicants, \ndespite that the Ashland Heights owners acknowledge that Black applicants are \nleast likely to apply to Ashland Heights.   \n34.  Moreover, between at least 2012 and 2017, AHA assigned multiple \n(non-elderly, non-disabled) White applicants ahead of comparable Black applicants \nto units at disproportionately and overwhelmingly White communities, even \nthough Black applicants had higher positions on the waiting list.  Similarly, in \nfilling vacancies at disproportionately Black communities, AHA assigned multiple \n(non-elderly, non-disabled) Black applicants ahead of comparable White \napplicants, even though White applicants had higher positions on the waiting list.   \nF. AHA Engaged in Discriminatory Conduct Regarding Ashland Heights \nWhile Acting as the Agent of Defendants Southern Development \nCompany of Ashland, Ltd., Southern Development Company of \nAshland #2, Ltd., and Southern Development Company, LLC. \n \n35.  At all times relevant to the allegations in this lawsuit, AHA’s conduct \nconcerning Ashland Heights was performed in its role as manager of Ashland \nHeights and agent of Southern Development Company of Ashland, Ltd., Southern \nDevelopment Company of Ashland #2, Ltd., and Southern Development Company, \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01905-ACA   Document 1   Filed 12/01/20   Page 13 of 17\nLLC, and AHA acted within the scope of its agency while engaging in the conduct \ndescribed herein.   \n36.  Defendants Southern Development Company of Ashland, Ltd. and \nSouthern Development Company of Ashland #2, Ltd., as owners of Ashland \nHeights, are liable for the conduct of their agents.   \n37.  Defendant Southern Development Company, LLC, as agent for \nSouthern Development Company of Ashland, Ltd. and Southern Development \nCompany of Ashland #2, Ltd., is responsible for renting the units at Ashland \nHeights I and Ashland Heights II, and is liable for the conduct of its agents.   \nG. AHA’s Conduct Violates the Fair Housing Act \n38.  The allegations set forth above are hereby re-alleged and incorporated \nby reference.   \n39.  Through its discriminatory policies and practices described above, \nAHA has harmed applicants and tenants.  AHA has done so by:   \na.  offering and assigning tenants to units in segregated housing based \non the race of the applicants; \nb.  skipping qualified Black applicants on the waiting list to fill \nvacancies at disproportionately and overwhelmingly White \ncommunities with later-applying White applicants, thereby \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01905-ACA   Document 1   Filed 12/01/20   Page 14 of 17\ndelaying or denying Black applicants housing and further \nsegregating AHA’s housing;  \nc.  skipping qualified White applicants on the waiting list to fill \nvacancies at disproportionately Black communities with later-\napplying Black applicants, thereby delaying or denying White \napplicants housing and further segregating AHA’s housing;  \nd.  allowing applicants who decline offers of housing without showing \ngood cause, even when they decline offers for race-based reasons, \nto maintain their position on the waiting list, thereby violating the \nACOP’s one-offer system requirement intended to prevent race \ndiscrimination; and  \ne.  failing to discuss Ashland Heights with Black applicants or \nconduct required outreach to prospective Black tenants about \nAshland Heights.    \n40.  By engaging in the conduct described above, the defendants have: (a) \nrefused to rent, refused to negotiate for the rental of, and otherwise made \nunavailable or denied dwellings to persons because of race or color, in violation of \n42 U.S.C. § 3604(a); and (b) discriminated in the terms, conditions, or privileges of \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01905-ACA   Document 1   Filed 12/01/20   Page 15 of 17\nrental of dwellings on the basis of race or color, in violation of 42 U.S.C. § \n3604(b). \n41.  The conduct of defendants constitutes:   \na.  A pattern or practice of resistance to the full enjoyment of rights \nsecured by the Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. § 3601 et seq.; and  \nb.  A denial to a group of persons of rights granted by the Fair \nHousing Act, 42 U.S.C. § 3601 et seq., which denial raises an issue \nof general public importance. \n42.  Individuals who were subjected to defendants’ discriminatory housing \npractices are aggrieved persons as defined by the Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. § \n3602(i), and have suffered actual injury and damages as a result of defendants’ \nconduct as described above. \n43.  Defendants’ conduct described above was intentional, willful, and \ntaken with disregard for the rights of others. \nClaim for Relief \nWHEREFORE, the United States asks that the Court enter an order that: \nA.  Declares that defendants’ policies and practices, as alleged herein, \nviolate the Fair Housing Act, as amended, 42 U.S.C. § 3601 et seq.; \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01905-ACA   Document 1   Filed 12/01/20   Page 16 of 17\nB.  Enjoins defendants, their agents, employees, and successors, and all \nothers in active concert or participation with them, from discriminating on account \nof race or color against any person in any aspect of the rental of a dwelling; \nC.  Requires defendants to take all necessary and appropriate affirmative \nsteps to correct, to the extent practicable, the continuing effects of their past and \npresent discriminatory practices; \nD.  Requires such action by defendants as may be necessary to restore, as \nnearly as practicable, all persons aggrieved by defendants’ discriminatory housing \npractices to the position these persons would have occupied but for defendants’ \ndiscriminatory conduct;  \nE.  Awards monetary damages to each person aggrieved by defendants’ \ndiscriminatory housing practices, in accordance with 42 U.S.C. § 3614(d)(1)(B); \nand \nF.  Assesses a civil penalty against each defendant in an amount \nauthorized by 42 U.S.C. § 3614(d)(1)(C), to vindicate the public interest. \n  The United States further prays for such additional relief as the interests of \njustice may require.   \n \n \nDated: December 1, 2020        \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01905-ACA   Document 1   Filed 12/01/20   Page 17 of 17\n              WILLIAM P.

The United States filed an amended complaint on January \n25, 2021. \n1 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01905-ACA  Document 81  Filed 12/13/22  Page 2 of 31 \nAt all times relevant to this action, Defendant Housing Authority has owned, \noperated, and/or managed six (formerly) public housing communities in Ashland, \nAlabama, containing 198 units, known as East Side, West Side, North Side, Runyan \nCourt, Pine View, and Clay Circle (referred to in this Consent Decree as the “public \nhousing” communities). Defendants Ashland Heights Owners have owned and/or \nmanaged two additional low-income housing communities in Ashland, Alabama, \nknown  as  Ashland  Heights  I  and  Ashland  Heights  II  (collectively,  “Ashland \nHeights”), with a total of 56 units. The Ashland Heights Owners have delegated to \nthe  Housing  Authority  the  day-to-day  management  and  operation  of  Ashland \nHeights, which includes renting, showing, maintaining, and managing its units. \nUnits at East Side, West Side, North Side, Runyan Court, Pine View, Clay \nCircle, and Ashland Heights are “dwellings” within the meaning of the FHA, 42 \nU.S.C.  §  3602(b).  Tenant  eligibility  for  this  housing  is  limited  to  low-income \ntenants. \nThe  United  States  alleges,  and  Defendants  deny,  that  Defendants  have \nengaged in a pattern or practice of housing discrimination, or denied to a group of \npersons rights protected under the FHA, because of race or color. \nThe parties stipulate that this Court has subject matter jurisdiction under 28 \nU.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1345, and 42 U.S.C. § 3614(a). The parties have voluntarily \n2 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01905-ACA  Document 81  Filed 12/13/22  Page 3 of 31 \nagreed, as indicated by the signatures below, to resolve the United States’ claims \nagainst Defendants without the necessity of further litigation. \nTherefore, it is ORDERED that: \nII.

Except as specified, the terms of the Consent Decree apply to the low-\nincome communities in Ashland, Alabama, known as East Side, Clay Circle, Runyan \nCourt, North Side, West Side, Pine View, Ashland Heights I, and Ashland Heights \nII (the “Subject Properties”). \n2.  Defendants  deny  having  committed  any  of  the  following  acts; \nnevertheless, they, their agents, employees, successors, and all other persons in \nactive concert or participation with any of them with respect to the Subject Properties \nare hereby enjoined, with respect to the sale or rental of dwellings, from: \na.  Refusing to rent a dwelling, refusing or failing to provide or offer \ninformation about a dwelling, refusing to negotiate for the rental \nof a dwelling, or otherwise making unavailable or denying a \ndwelling to any person because of (i) the race or color of that \nperson or any person in the household, or (ii) the race or color of \npersons residing in the housing community or neighborhood of \nthe unit; \n3 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01905-ACA  Document 81  Filed 12/13/22  Page 4 of 31 \nb.  Discriminating against any person in the terms, conditions, or \nprivileges of the sale or rental of a dwelling, or in the provision \nof services or facilities in connection therewith, because of race \nor color; \nc.  Discouraging  any  person  from  inspecting  or  renting  a  unit \nbecause of race or color or because of the race or color of persons \nin a housing community or neighborhood; \nd.  Offering any person a unit, or allowing a person to decline an \noffer to be placed in a unit in a particular housing community or \nneighborhood, because of the person’s preference based on race \nor  color  known  to  Defendants  (or  their  agents,  employees, \nsuccessors, or others in active concert or participation with any \nof them); and \ne.  Failing  to  conduct  outreach  or  marketing,  as  required  by \napplicable U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development \n(“HUD”)  and  U.S.  Department  of  Agriculture  (“USDA”) \nrequirements  governing  federally  funded  public  and  assisted \nhousing  to  prospective  applicants  and  tenants  of  Ashland \nHeights. \n4 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01905-ACA  Document 81  Filed 12/13/22  Page 5 of 31 \nIII.  NONDISCRIMINATORY PROCEDURES \nFOR APPLICATIONS, OFFERS OF UNITS, AND TRANSFERS \n3.  The parties acknowledge that the Housing Authority has adopted a \nwritten Admissions and Continued Occupancy Policy (“ACOP”), which sets forth \nprocedures to be followed with respect to the placement of applicants into the \nHousing Authority’s public housing properties. The parties acknowledge that the \nAshland Heights Owners have adopted a Tenant Selection Plan (“TSP”), which sets \nforth procedures to be followed with respect to the placement of applicants into \nAshland Heights I and Ashland Heights II. Defendants further acknowledge their \nindividual legal obligation to comply with applicable HUD and USDA regulations \ngoverning  federally  funded  public  and  assisted  housing.  Defendants  shall  also \ncomply with the specific procedures in this Consent Decree to ensure compliance \nwith the FHA and to ensure that the Subject Properties are made available for rent \non the same terms and conditions, irrespective of race or color. Within one year of \nthe date of entry of this Consent Decree, Defendants shall take the necessary steps \n(including seeking any required approval from regulatory agencies) to revise the \nACOP and/or TSP, if necessary, to reflect and incorporate the procedures in this \nSection of the Consent Decree. \n4.  Defendants shall take the following actions, which are intended to \nensure nondiscrimination in offering units to applicants, remediation of alleged past \n5 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01905-ACA  Document 81  Filed 12/13/22  Page 6 of 31 \nand/or  current  segregated  housing  patterns,  and  a  proper  record  that  can  be \nmonitored for compliance:1 \na.  Unit Availability Lists. On a weekly basis, Defendants shall print \nout and post a list of available units in each program. For each \navailable public housing unit, the  Unit  Availability  List  will \nidentify: (i) the name of the housing community, street address, \nand number of bedrooms; (ii) any designations governing who is \neligible  to  live  in  the  unit  (e.g.,  only  elderly  or  disabled \nhouseholds); and (iii) the date of the list. For each available unit \nat Ashland Heights (including units that are vacant but not yet \nready to be leased), the Unit Availability List will identify: (i) the \nname of the housing community, the unit number, and number \nof bedrooms and (ii) the date of the list. Defendants shall post the \nUnit Availability Lists in a prominent location visible to the \npublic at their or their agent’s rental office with the information \ncontained in the Preference and Eligibility Information Sheet \n(see  below).  To  the  extent  that  any  Defendant  maintains  a \n1  Each Defendant is required to take the actions pertaining to any of the particular Subject \nProperties only to the extent that it is an owner and/or agent of that property and that the provision \napplies to that particular property. \n6 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01905-ACA  Document 81  Filed 12/13/22  Page 7 of 31 \nwebsite or websites regarding any of the Subject Properties, the \nwebsite(s) will state that the Unit Availability List is posted \nweekly on a bulletin board in its rental office (or that of its agent, \nas applicable). Defendants shall maintain an electronic or paper \ncopy of each posted list. \nb.  Preference and Eligibility Information Sheet. Defendants or their \nagent  shall  provide  a  copy  of  the  Preference  and  Eligibility \nInformation Sheet, which is attached as Appendix A, to every \napplicant and require each applicant to sign this document when \nsubmitting their application form. Defendants or their agent shall \nretain  copies  of  each  signed  Preference  and  Eligibility \nInformation Sheet in the applicant’s file. The Preference and \nEligibility Information Sheet lists the following information: the \nproperties and units  within  the  respective  housing programs, \nnoting to which elderly and/or disabled preferences apply; the \neligibility requirements for the respective programs; and any \napplicable factors that would permit an applicant to be offered a \n7 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01905-ACA  Document 81  Filed 12/13/22  Page 8 of 31 \nunit before other applicants.2 With respect to the public housing \nproperties,  the  Preference  and  Eligibility  Information  Sheet \nexplains all preferences or priorities—i.e., factors that would \npermit  an  applicant  to  be  placed  into  a  unit  before  other \napplicants seeking a unit with the same number of bedrooms who \napplied earlier in time, such as elderly or disabled status. With \nrespect  to  Ashland  Heights  I  and  Ashland  Heights  II,  the \nPreference and Eligibility Information Sheet explains that there \nare no such factors. \nc.  Waiting Lists. Defendants shall place each applicant onto the \nwaiting  list(s)  for  all  programs  in  Ashland  managed  by \nDefendants or their agent for which the applicant is qualified.3 \nDefendants  shall  maintain  separate  waiting  lists  for  each \nbedroom-size unit managed by the Housing Authority consistent \nwith the ACOP and/or TSP. For each applicant on a waiting list, \nthe list shall identify the applicant’s name; current address; one \n2 The printed version of the Preference and Eligibility Information Sheet shall be a one-page \nhandout (not including Exhibit 1 to the Preference and Eligibility Information Sheet); if the text \ntakes up two pages, it should be printed double-sided. \n3 The three housing programs are (i) the Housing Authority’s public housing units, (ii) Ashland \nHeights I, and (iii) Ashland Heights II. \n8 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01905-ACA  Document 81  Filed 12/13/22  Page 9 of 31 \nor  more  current  telephone  numbers;  number  of  household \nmembers; any applicable preference(s); the time and date his or \nher application was submitted; the time and date the applicant \nwas deemed eligible; and the time and date he or she was placed \non the waiting list.4  Defendants or their agent shall record on \neach paper application the name of the individual employee or \nagent who received the application. For any application that is \nimported by an employee or agent of a Defendant from an online \napplication  system  into  an  electronic  waiting  list  system, \nDefendants shall record the identity of the employee or agent \nwho completes the importation. The rank of each applicant on \nthe waiting list shall be determined in accordance with the ACOP \nor  TSP,  applicable  HUD  and  USDA  requirements,  and  the \nrequirements in this Section of the Consent Decree. Defendants \nshall  generate  and  retain  an  updated  waiting  list  after  each \nhousing placement and shall maintain complete, accurate, and \nup-to-date records to support the information in the lists. The \n4 The versions of the waiting lists that Defendants will provide as part of the record retention and \nreporting requirements in paragraphs 24-25 will also include each applicant’s race. \n9 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01905-ACA  Document 81  Filed 12/13/22  Page 10 of 31 \nHousing  Authority  shall  maintain  a  website  allowing  all \napplicants to determine their position on each waiting list on \nwhich the Housing Authority has placed the applicants. If an \napplicant moves into a unit owned by one of the Defendants, that \nDefendant or its agent will remove the applicant from any other \nwaiting lists for Subject Properties managed or owned by that \nDefendant or its agent (if any). \nd.  Transfers. Defendants shall allow tenants to request transfers by \ncompleting  a  Transfer  Request  Form,  which  is  attached  as \nAppendix B. Defendants or their agent shall provide a copy of \nthe Transfer Request Form to every tenant who expresses interest \nin or asks about transferring, whether verbally or in writing. \nDefendants or their agent shall maintain records reflecting all \ntransfer requests containing the resident’s name, race, current \naddress, one or more telephone numbers, number of household \nmembers, size of unit for which the resident is eligible, date of \nthe transfer request, reason for the transfer request, whether the \n10 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01905-ACA  Document 81  Filed 12/13/22  Page 11 of 31 \nrequest  was  granted,  and  the  employee  who  received  the \nrequest.5 \ne.  Offers. In addition to the procedures in the ACOP or TSP (as \napplicable)  for  contacting  applicants  to  offer  them  a  unit, \nDefendants  or  their  agent  shall  call  the  telephone  number \nprovided by the applicant to inform the applicant of the offer. \nDefendants or their agent shall electronically record all offers or \nattempted offers of housing; all contact attempts made, including \nthe name of the contacting employee; responses or absence of \nresponse; refusals by the applicant; reason given by applicant for \nrefusal; where applicable, the Housing Authority’s determination \nof whether each refusal was for “good cause;” any change to an \napplicant’s place on the waiting list as a result of refusing or not \nresponding to an offer; and housing placements. \n5 Pursuant to the TSP, transfers within Ashland Heights I or within Ashland Heights II for a change \nin  household  composition  necessitating  a  different  sized  unit,  a  reasonable  accommodation \nrequest, and/or protection under the Violence Against Women Act are given preference over other \napplicants on the corresponding waitlist. Transfers of units for other reasons are treated as any \nother applicant on the waitlist. Transfers between Ashland Heights I and Ashland Heights II are \ntreated as new applications. \n11 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01905-ACA  Document 81  Filed 12/13/22  Page 12 of 31 \nf.  Occupants  Directory.  Defendants  shall  maintain  a  current \nOccupants Directory that is updated at least monthly that lists the \nresidents at each of the Subject Properties managed or owned by \nthem.

Defendants or their \nagent must verbally inform all such applicants or prospective \napplicants that they may apply for any of the Subject Properties, \nand  that  should  they  do  so,  they  would  be  offered  the  first \navailable unit at any property for which they qualify once they \nare at the top of the applicable waiting list. \ni.  Good Cause Policy. In addition to the procedures in the ACOP \ngoverning “good cause” for refusal of an offer, the Housing \nAuthority will make determinations of “good cause” regarding \nthe public housing properties consistent with the bases outlined \nin the Good Cause Policy. The Good Cause Policy is attached as \nAppendix C. \nj.  Pending Applicants. When an applicant applies to the Housing \nAuthority’s  public  housing  without  providing  all  required \ndocumentation to the Housing Authority, the Housing Authority \nwill enter the application into its database with a “pending” status \n13 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01905-ACA  Document 81  Filed 12/13/22  Page 14 of 31 \nand associated application date of the date on which the applicant \nsubmitted  the  application,  and  the  Housing  Authority  shall \nprovide the applicant a letter stating that the applicant must bring \nin  the  required  documentation  within  fifteen  days.  Once  an \napplicant  has  provided  all  the  required  documentation  and \neligibility  has  been  established,  the  Housing  Authority  will \npromptly  change  the  applicant’s  status  to  “eligible.”  The \nHousing Authority will make offers only to eligible applicants, \nexcept that if there are no eligible applicants on a particular \nwaiting list, the Housing Authority will offer the unit to pending \napplicants in the order in which they applied, subject to their \nbecoming eligible. The Housing Authority will not otherwise \ninitiate  contact  with  pending  applicants  regarding  their \napplications, unless it contacts all other pending applicants for \nthe same purpose on or around the same date. As provided in the \nTSP, under no circumstances will Defendants make an offer to \nan applicant for a unit at Ashland Heights I or Ashland Heights \nII unless the applicant has submitted all required documents. \n14 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01905-ACA  Document 81  Filed 12/13/22  Page 15 of 31 \nk.  Outreach. Within six months of the date of entry of this Consent \nDecree, the Ashland Heights Owners and/or their agent must \ncreate  and  implement  an  outreach  plan  that  is  specifically \ntargeted at members of all groups that they have identified as \nleast likely to apply to Ashland Heights I and Ashland Heights II \nwithout special outreach efforts in their 2017 Affirmative Fair \nHousing Marketing Plan. This outreach plan may take the same \nform as Affirmative Fair Housing Marketing Plans submitted to \nHUD  and/or  USDA.  This  plan  must  include  at  least  five \norganizations (which could include local businesses, non-profits, \nand/or  religious  organizations),  advertising  channels,  and/or \ncommunity  events  that  will  be  used  to  inform  community \nmembers in each of the groups described above of the housing \nopportunities at Ashland Heights I and Ashland Heights II. The \nAshland Heights Owners or their agent must verify that these \nentities have a significant percentage of members, customers, \nand/or attendees that belong to the group(s) identified as least \nlikely to apply, as described above. The Ashland Heights Owners \nmust take reasonable steps to utilize outreach materials, targets, \n15 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01905-ACA  Document 81  Filed 12/13/22  Page 16 of 31 \nand/or techniques that are likely to attract applicants who are \nleast likely to apply, as described above, and their outreach plan \nmust  include  steps  explaining  how  they  will  evaluate  the \neffectiveness  of  their  outreach,  including  but  not  limited  to \nrequiring the Ashland Heights Owners or their agent to maintain \na detailed log of the specific referral or information source of \neach  prospective  applicant  that  contacts  them.  The  Ashland \nHeights Owners and/or their agent will repeat the process of \ncreating and implementing an outreach plan at least once per year \nand  at  least  twice  during  the  term  of  the  Consent  Decree, \nrepeating  any  outreach  activities  that  were  successful  in \nattracting  members  of  the  groups  least  likely  to  apply  and \nreplacing unsuccessful outreach activities with new ones. \nl.

Within  15  days  of \n16 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01905-ACA  Document 81  Filed 12/13/22  Page 17 of 31 \nreceiving that list, the Ashland Heights Owners will provide the \nUnited  States  with  its  response,  including  identifying  any \napplicants on the United States’ list that the Ashland Heights \nOwners contend would not have been eligible to be placed on the \nrelevant  waiting  list(s)  when  they  initially  applied,  even \nassuming they had been given  an opportunity to provide all \nrequired supporting documentation. The United States and the \nAshland Heights Owners will work together cooperatively in \ngood  faith  to  promptly  resolve  any  disagreements  regarding \nwhich applicants qualify and agree upon a final list of applicants \nwho should have been placed on the waiting list(s) for Ashland \nHeights I and/or Ashland Heights II when they initially applied \n(“final list”). Within 15 days of the resolution of the final list, the \nAshland Heights Owners will send a Notice Letter, attached as \nAppendix D, to each applicant on the final list and notify the \nUnited States once they have done so. The Notice Letter states \nthat those applicants can opt to be placed on the waiting list for \nAshland Heights I and/or Ashland Heights II, as applicable, to \nthe extent they are currently eligible, in a position determined by \n17 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01905-ACA  Document 81  Filed 12/13/22  Page 18 of 31 \nthe application date corresponding to the date of their initial \napplication; describes the procedures that applicants must take to \nbe added to the waiting list; and allows them 60 days to respond \nand complete those procedures.7 Within seven days of receiving \naffirmative responses from any such recipient, Ashland Heights \nOwners shall place the person on the waiting list for Ashland \nHeights  I  and/or  Ashland  Heights  II  (as  applicable),  with  a \ncorresponding  application  date  of  the  date  of  their  initial \napplication. \n5.

The Ashland Heights Owners will send the \nNotice Letter to each applicant using at least two methods of contact, if known, such as mail and \nemail address. If the Ashland Heights Owners receive notification that an applicant’s Notice Letter \nwas returned as undeliverable (whether via email or mail), they shall notify the United States \nwithin seven days and make reasonable attempts to re-send the Notice Letter to that applicant, \nincluding, if applicable, by using additional contact information provided by the United States. \nNothing in this Consent Decree prevents the United States from making its own additional efforts \nto notify applicants subject to this subparagraph of the provisions of the Notice Letter; and the \nUnited States’ choice to do so shall not obviate the Ashland Heights Owners of any of its own \nobligations under this subparagraph. \n18 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01905-ACA  Document 81  Filed 12/13/22  Page 19 of 31 \nDefendant shall implement all posting requirements described in paragraph 4 within \n15 days of the opening of the rental office. \n6.

The civil penalty payment obligation specified in paragraph 19 is a debt \nfor a fine, penalty, or forfeiture payable to and for the benefit of the United States \nwithin the meaning of 11 U.S.C. § 523(a)(7), and is not compensation for actual \npecuniary loss.

OF ALABAMA \nGOOD CAUSE POLICY \nIn addition to the examples provided in AHA’s ACOP, AHA considers each of the following as \n“Good Cause” for Refusal of an offer without loss of the applicant’s current position on waiting \nlist: \n•   Temporary lack of funds for utility deposits, housing deposit, and prorated rent, for up to \n90  days.  Such  lack  of  funds  must  be  verified  by  proof  of  income/deductions \ndocumentation. \n•   Applicant or household member medical conditions that prevent relocation. Such medical \nconditions must be verified by a licensed healthcare professional. \n•   Applicant or household member is not receiving disability benefits but has mobility issues \nthat limit safe access to the unit offered. \n•   Death of a household member, verified by death certificate or published obituary, that \ntemporarily prevents applicant from moving. \n•   Applicant is bound by a lease agreement at another rental property for up to 90 days, \nverified by a valid lease signed by applicant. \nAHA will not consider refusals due to location preferences to be “good cause” except as provided \nhere or stated in the ACOP. \nProcedures for Determining Good Cause \nWhenever an applicant refuses an offer, AHA will ask the applicant the reason for the refusal. \nPursuant to the ACOP and the Consent Decree, AHA will electronically record the reason(s) given, \nverify any reasons that potentially constitute good cause, and gather and maintain supporting \ndocumentation for such reasons. \nAHA’s Executive Director will personally make or approve every decision regarding whether an \napplicant had good cause to refuse an offer. Once the Executive Director has made a final \ndetermination, AHA will electronically record that determination. Additionally, AHA will attempt \nto contact the applicant to convey that determination and its effects on the applicant’s waiting \nlist position. AHA will document all such communications or attempted communications in its \ncomputer system. \nIf AHA verifies that an applicant has good cause to refuse an offer based on temporary lack of \nfunds or an existing lease agreement, AHA will inform the applicant that, for a period of 90 days \nfrom the original offer, he or she will not receive any further offers. AHA will also inform the \napplicant that he or she may contact AHA if he or she becomes ready in less than 90 days. AHA \nwill maintain an up-to-date record in the applicant’s electronic file of the 90-day date or the \napplicant’s sooner available date if applicable. Once 90 days have passed or the applicant notifies \nAHA that he or she is ready to receive an offer (whichever comes first), the applicant will receive \nan offer for any vacancy for which he or she is at the top of the waiting list. For each application, \nany subsequent refusal(s) based on the same reason (temporary lack of funds or another lease \nagreement) will not be considered good cause. \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01905-ACA  Document 81-4  Filed 12/13/22  Page 1 of 1  FILED\n 2022 Dec-13 PM 04:48 \nU.S. DISTRICT COURT \nN.D.

Defendants cannot \noffer units in particular housing communities or neighborhoods to applicants \nbased on their race or color, or the race or color of their household members. \n•   Defendants must follow certain procedures  to ensure nondiscrimination, \ntransparency, and consistency in processing applications, offering units to \napplicants, and managing transfers. \n•   Defendants must make efforts to address the alleged past and/or current \nsegregated housing patterns, including by conducting required outreach to \ngroups who are least likely to apply to Ashland Heights I and II without \nspecial outreach efforts. \n•   Defendants must submit regular compliance reports to the United States, \nmake all records related to this Consent Decree available to the United States \nupon request, and notify the United States of any housing discrimination \ncomplaint against them or their employees. \n•   Defendants must establish a Settlement Fund to compensate the individuals \nwho  previously  participated  as  “aggrieved  persons”  during  the  lawsuit. \nDefendants must also pay a civil penalty to the United States. \nA copy of the Consent Decree, this notice and summary of the Consent Decree, and \nAHA’s written procedures governing admissions and occupancy are posted publicly at \n[insert address(es) and website links].

Also before the court \nis the Housing Authority’s motion for sanctions and fees.  (Doc. 23). \n  Plaintiff  United  States  of  America  alleges  that  the  Housing  Authority \nemployed discriminatory policies and practices in managing several publicly-funded \nhousing  communities  in  violation  of  the  Fair  Housing  Act  (“FHA”).  Both  the \nHousing Authority and the Southern Defendants argue that the amended complaint \nfails to state a claim and is too vague to provide them with notice of the claims \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01905-ACA   Document 28   Filed 05/12/21   Page 2 of 10\nagainst them.  (Doc. 11; Doc. 12).  The Housing Authority goes further, arguing that \nthe United States’ complaint is so deficient that the court should impose sanctions \non the United States.  (Doc. 23).  The amended complaint, however, is properly \ndrafted  and  states  a  claim  for  race  discrimination  in  violation  of  the  FHA.  \nAccordingly, the court DENIES the pending motions.   \nI.  BACKGROUND \nAt this stage, the court must accept as true the factual allegations in the \ncomplaint and construe them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.  Butler v. \nSheriff of Palm Beach Cty., 685 F.3d 1261, 1265 (11th Cir. 2012). \nThe Housing Authority is a political subdivision of the State of Alabama \ncreated to provide low-income housing in Ashland, Alabama.  (Doc. 9 at 2).  In 1958, \nthe Housing Authority developed two public housing communities in Ashland, the \nEast Side and West Side communities.  (Id. at 3).  The Housing Authority originally \nestablished these communities as part of a racially segregated public housing system: \nEast Side was designated as a “white” community and West Side as a “non-white” \ncommunity.  (Id.).  Later, the Housing Authority expanded, adding several integrated \ncommunities named North Side, Runyon Court, Pine View, and Clay Circle.  (Id.). \nIn  the  early  1980s,  the  Housing  Authority  began  managing  a  seventh \nlow-income housing community known as Ashland Heights.  (Doc. 9 at 4).  Ashland \nHeights consists of two housing developments—Ashland Heights I and Ashland \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01905-ACA   Document 28   Filed 05/12/21   Page 3 of 10\nHeights  II—both  of  which  are  federally  funded.    (Id.).    Two  of  the  Southern \nDefendants  own  the  Ashland  Heights  developments  and  the  third,  Southern \nDevelopment Company, LLC, acts as their agent.  (Id. at 2–3).  The Housing \nAuthority manages Ashland Heights as the Southern Defendants’ agent.  (Id. at 4). \nSince at least 2012, five of the seven communities the Housing Authority \noperates house occupants that are disproportionately of one race.  (Doc. 9 at 6).  \nAshland Heights, Clay Circle, and East Side are largely occupied by White1 tenants \nand West Side and Pine View are disproportionately occupied by Black tenants.  \n(Id.).  For example, in June 2018, 69% of the Housing Authority’s tenants were \nwhite, but 99% of tenants at Ashland Heights were White, 92% of tenants at East \nSide were White, and 91% of tenants at Clay Circle were White.  (Id.).  At the same \ntime, 30% of all Housing Authority tenants were Black, but 73% of tenants at West \nSide were Black and 65% of tenants at Pine View were Black.  (Id.). \nThe racial disparity extends to new tenants, ensuring continued segregation at \nthe Housing Authority’s communities.  Between January 2012 and May 2018, the \nHousing Authority filled over 230 vacancies.  (Doc. 9 at 8).  Of the tenants filling \nthose vacancies, 76% were White households.  (Id.).  But 95% of the vacancies at \nEast Side and 96% of those at Clay Circle were filled by White households.  (Id.).  \n                                                           \n1 The court adopts the stylistic convention used by the parties and will capitalize both \n“Black” and “White.”  (See, e.g., Doc. 9 at 4; Doc. 11 at 5; Doc. 12 at  17). \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01905-ACA   Document 28   Filed 05/12/21   Page 4 of 10\nLikewise, although 24% of the Housing Authority’s overall vacancies were filled by \nBlack households, 45% of vacancies at West Side and 57% at Pine View were filled \nby Black households.  (Id.). \nThe Housing Authority has an Admissions and Continued Occupancy Policy \n(“Admissions Policy”) that governs the public housing units administered by the \nHousing Authority.  (Doc. 9 at 9).  The Admissions Policy requires that the Housing \nAuthority curate a centralized waiting list for public housing applicants in the order \nin which households applied for housing and without regard to tenant preference for \na particular location.  (Id.).  The Admissions Policy also requires that the Housing \nAuthority follow a one-offer policy intended to prevent discrimination.  (Id. at 10).  \nThe one-offer policy required applicants to either accept an offer for housing from \nthe Housing Authority or show good cause for declining the offer.  (Id. at 10).  Under \nthis policy, the Housing Authority moves applicants who decline an offer without \ngood cause to the bottom of the waiting list.  (Doc. 9 at 10).   \nThe  complaint  alleges  that  the  Housing  Authority  does  not  follow  its \nAdmissions Policy.  (Id.).  When an applicant fails to show good cause for declining \na housing offer, the Housing Authority does not move the applicant to the bottom of \nthe waiting list.  (Doc. 9 at 10).  In one instance, the Housing Authority failed to \nmove the applicant to the bottom of the waiting list after the applicant “explicitly \ninformed [the Housing Authority] its reason for declining the offer was based on not \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01905-ACA   Document 28   Filed 05/12/21   Page 5 of 10\nwanting to live near other residents because of their race or national origin.”  (Id.).  \nThe Housing Authority’s failure to follow the Admissions Policy injures applicants \nby  “skipping  Black  applicants  on  the  waiting  list  to  fill  vacancies  at \ndisproportionately  and  overwhelmingly  White  communities  with  later-applying \nWhite applicants . . . [and] skipping qualified White applicants on the waiting list to \nfill vacancies at disproportionately Black communities with later-applying Black \napplicants . . . .”  (Id. at 13). \nThe owners of Ashland Heights also submit an Affirmative Fair Housing \nMarketing  Plan  (“Marketing  Plan”)  to  the  Department  of  Housing  and  Urban \nDevelopment (“HUD”) every three years.  (Doc. 9 at 10).  The three Marketing Plans \nsubmitted during the relevant time period reported that the waitlist for Ashland \nHeights were all-White or nearly all-White and that Blacks were one of the groups \nleast likely to apply to the Ashland Heights community.  (Id. at 10–11).  For example, \nof the seventy-four applicants to Ashland Heights II between 2011 and 2018, none \nof the applicants were Black.  (Id. at 11).  The United States alleges that this \nrepresents a failure to “conduct outreach to specific groups who may be unlikely to \napply” to certain communities as required by HUD guidelines.  (Id. at 12–13).   \nThis  outreach  failure  is  further  exacerbated  by  the  Housing  Authority’s \napplication  process.    The  application  requires  each  applicant  to  select  among \nseparate boxes for “PUBLIC HOUSING,” “Ashland Heights I (Sec 8 New Const),” \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01905-ACA   Document 28   Filed 05/12/21   Page 6 of 10\nand “Ashland Heights II (FmHA 515 Elderly).”  (Doc. 9 at 11).  Applicants must \nalso undergo an in-person interview with the Housing Authority.  (Id.).  And the \nHousing Authority does not discuss the option to apply to both Ashland Heights and \npublic housing with Black applicants.  (Id. at 11).   \nAlleging that the Housing Authority’s conduct violates the FHA, the United \nStates brought this suit.  (Id. at 14–15).  The United States also alleges the Housing \nAuthority acted as the agent of the Southern Defendants, subjecting the Southern \nDefendants to vicarious liability for the Housing Authority’s conduct.  (Id. at 12).  \nBoth the Housing Authority and the Southern Defendants filed motions to dismiss \nor for a more definite statement (docs. 11, 12), and the Housing Authority moved \nfor sanctions and fees pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11 (doc. 23). \nII.  DISCUSSION \nThe Housing Authority and the Southern Defendants’ arguments—both for \ndismissal and for a more definite statement—largely hinge on confusion about which \ntheory of discrimination the United States is advancing.  But at this stage, the United \nStates only needs to plausibly state a claim for relief.  The amended complaint states \na claim for race-based discrimination in violation of the FHA and complies with the \npleading standards of the Eleventh Circuit and the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  \nAccordingly, the court DENIES the motions. \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01905-ACA   Document 28   Filed 05/12/21   Page 7 of 10\n1.  The Motions to Dismiss or for a More Definite Statement \n “To survive a [Rule 12(b)(6)] motion to dismiss, the plaintiff must plead ‘a \nclaim to relief that is plausible on its face.’”  Butler, 685 F.3d at 1265 (quoting Bell \nAtl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007)).  “A claim has facial plausibility \nwhen the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable \ninference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.”  Ashcroft v. Iqbal, \n556  U.S.  662,  678  (2009).    This  standard  “does  not  require  detailed  factual \nallegations,  but it demands  more  than  an  unadorned, the-defendant-unlawfully-\nharmed-me accusation.”  Id. (quotation marks omitted).  Rule 12(e), by contrast, \nallows the court to order a more definite statement when the pleading “is so vague \nor ambiguous that the party cannot reasonably prepare a response.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. \n12(e). \nIt is a violation of § 3604(a) of the FHA to “refuse to sell or rent after the \nmaking of a bona fide offer, or to refuse to negotiate for the sale or rental of, or \notherwise make unavailable or deny, a dwelling to any person because of race, color, \nreligion, sex, familial status, or national origin.”  42 U.S.C. § 3604(a).  Section \n3604(b) prohibits discrimination “against any person in the terms, conditions, or \nprivileges of sale or rental of a dwelling” because of the same protected classes.  Id. \n§ 3604(b). \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01905-ACA   Document 28   Filed 05/12/21   Page 8 of 10\nA  plaintiff  can  establish  a  violation  of  the  FHA  by  making  either  a \ndisparate-treatment claim or a disparate-impact claim.  Texas Dep’t of Hous. & \nCmty. Affs. v. Inclusive Cmtys. Project, Inc., 576 U.S. 519, 524 (2015) (quoting Ricci \nv. DeStefano, 557 U.S. 557, 577 (2009)).  Further, the Attorney General can sue \nunder the FHA whenever he “has reasonable cause to believe” that (1) “any person \nor group of persons is engaged in a pattern or practice of resistance to the full \nenjoyment of any of the rights [under the FHA];” or that (2) “any group of persons \nhas been denied any of the rights granted by this subchapter and such denial raises \nan issue of general public importance.”  42 U.S.C. § 3614(a). \n  The complaint here alleges violations of §§ 3604(a) and (b) (doc. 9 at 14) and \nalleges sufficient facts to state a claim under all three theories of liability (id. at \n3–13).  At this stage, the United States does not have to choose one theory but can \nadvance its claim under each theory independently.  See Hallmark Devs., Inc. v. \nFulton Cty., Ga., 466 F.3d 1276, 1283–85 (11th Cir. 2006) (analyzing the appellant’s \nFHA claim under both intentional discrimination and disparate impact theories of \nliability). \nThe United States alleges that the Housing Authority steered tenants toward \ncertain housing complexes by violating their own one-offer policy.  (Doc. 9 at 10).  \nSpecifically, the United States alleges that the Housing Authority did not move \napplicants who declined offers without showing good cause to the bottom of the \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01905-ACA   Document 28   Filed 05/12/21   Page 9 of 10\nwaiting list, even, in one example, when the applicant’s reason for declining the offer \nwas  explicitly  discriminatory.    (Id.).    This  process  resulted  in  White  tenants \naccepting  offers  to  live  at  majority  White  communities  “even  though  Black \napplicants had higher positions on the waiting list.”  (Doc. 9 at 12).  The United \nStates also presents significant statistical evidence to support its claim.  When \nviewed in the light most favorable to the United States, the evidence here is more \nthan sufficient to support a claim for race discrimination in violation of the FHA. \nFinally, Defendants’ arguments for a more definite statement are meritless.  \nRepleading is appropriate when a complaint “is so vague or ambiguous that the party \ncannot reasonably prepare a response.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(e).  Here, the United \nStates’ claim is supported with enough factual specificity to allow Defendants to \nprepare a response.  Because the complaint complies with Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure and the pleading standards of the Eleventh Circuit, no more definite \nstatement is necessary.  Accordingly, the court DENIES Defendants’ motions to \ndismiss or for a more definite statement.  (Doc. 11, 12). \n2.  The Housing Authority’s Motion for Rule 11 Sanctions and Fees \nThe Housing Authority also moves for sanctions and fees against the United \nStates pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11.  (Doc. 23).  “Rule 11 sanctions \nare warranted when a party files a pleading that (1) has no reasonable factual basis; \n(2) is based on a legal theory that has no reasonable chance of success and that cannot \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01905-ACA   Document 28   Filed 05/12/21   Page 10 of 10\nbe advanced as a reasonable argument to change existing law; and (3) is filed in bad \nfaith for an improper purpose.”  Baker v. Alderman, 158 F.3d 516, 524 (11th Cir. \n1998).  In short, “the purpose of Rule 11 is to deter frivolous lawsuits . . . .”  Id. \n  There is no frivolity here.  The Housing Authority’s arguments in favor of \nsanctions rely primarily on minor misstatements in the amended complaint.  But the \npurpose of Rule 11 is not to punish minor inconsistencies.  Accordingly, the court \nDENIES the Housing Authority’s motion for sanctions and fees.  (Doc. 23). \nIII.  CONCLUSION \nThe court DENIES the Defendants’ motions to dismiss and for a more definite \nstatement (docs. 11, 12) and DENIES the Housing Authority’s motion for sanctions \nand fees (doc. 23). \nDONE and ORDERED this May 12, 2021. \n \n \n \n      _________________________________ \n      ANNEMARIE CARNEY AXON \n      UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE \n \n10 \n ",
