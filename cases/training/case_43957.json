    "summary": "<p>On December 6, 2022, Disability Rights North Carolina (DRNC), the NAACP, and Children's Rights filed suit on behalf of a class of North Carolina youth in foster care with mental and behavioral health. The plaintiffs filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina against the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS). The case was assigned to Judge William L. Osteen, Jr. and Magistrate Judge L. Patrick Auld.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs asserted that the defendants&rsquo; actions violated the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. In particular, the plaintiffs alleged that DHHS was discriminating against children with disabilities in child welfare custody by unnecessarily segregating them from their home communities and placing them in heavily restrictive, and often clinically inappropriate, psychiatric residential treatment facilities (PRTFs). The plaintiffs requested class-wide relief and asked the Court to certify the putative class and award permanent injunctive relief. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs sought class certification for those meeting the following criteria: (a) children who are or will be in North Carolina foster care, who are or will be in the custody of a North Carolina county department of social services; (b) with a mental impairment that substantially limits at least one major life activity, or a record of such an impairment; (c) who are unnecessarily institutionalized in a PRTF or who are at serious risk of such institutionalization.</p>\r\n<p>On March 6, 2023, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, removing one of the named plaintiffs. Later that month, on March 20, the defendants moved to dismiss for failure to state a claim and lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\r\n<p>The United States filed a statement of interest in support of the plaintiffs' claims on April 21, 2023. The US argued that 1) the plaintiffs did not need opinions from state treatment professionals in order to establish that integrated settings were appropriate; 2) the children in state custody did not need to allege that their custodians chose community-based care; 3) pending state court proceedings about whether children should be placed in PRTFs did not prevent the plaintiffs from bringing these claims of unnecessary segregation; and 4) the plaintiffs had standing to bring claims against DHHS.</p>\r\n<p>Almost a year later, on March 29, 2024, Judge Osteen denied the defendants' motion to dismiss. 2024 WL 1350071. The Court held that the Plaintiffs had established standing and that their allegations met the requirements of <em><a href=\"../../../../case/11643/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">L.C. v. Olmstead</a></em>. Under <em>Olmstead</em>, community placement is required when: (1) community placement is appropriate; (2) &ldquo;the transfer from institutional care to a less restrictive setting is not opposed by the affected individual;&rdquo; and (3) &ldquo;the placement can be reasonably accommodated, taking into account the resources available to the State and the needs of others with mental disabilities.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>The Court found that on the facts alleged, though some of the plaintiffs were frequently institutionalized, it was because of a lack of community-based alternatives, not because they required institutionalization, so the plaintiffs had still sufficiently alleged community placement was appropriate. Some plaintiffs were not in institutions but were allegedly at serious risk of being institutionalized, which is also covered by <em>Olmstead.</em> Second, the Court held that <em>Olmstead </em>did not require a minor to allege that their custodian requested community placement: the plaintiffs alleged that they desired community-based services, meeting the second <em>Olmstead </em>prong. Third, the Court held that plaintiffs sufficiently alleged that their placement in the community could be reasonably accommodated, stating that any inquiry into the effectiveness of the state&rsquo;s plan for community-based services was not necessary at the motion to dismiss stage. Finally, the court held that the Plaintiffs&rsquo; claims were not barred by issue preclusion based on state court hearings because the state court hearings were based on individual placements and not the systemic failures alleged here.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>This case is ongoing as of April 26, 2024.&nbsp;</p>",

This action seeks to end ongoing discrimination by the North Carolina\nDepartment of Health and Human Services (“DHHS”) against children with disabilities\nplaced in child welfare custody(“foster care”) who are unnecessarily segregated from\ntheir home communities and routinelyisolated in heavily restrictive, and often clinically\n1\nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 1   Filed 12/06/22   Page 1 of 73\n\ninappropriate, institutional placements known as psychiatric residential treatment\nfacilities (“PRTFs”).\n2. On any given day, hundreds of children with disabilities in DHHS custody\nremain confined inside PRTFs, away from their communities. A material percentage of\nthese children would be better – and far more cost-effectively – supported with integrated\ncommunity-based and family-based placements (housing) and services, including mental\nand behavioral health services.\n3. DHHS can support clinically appropriate, less restrictive placements, but\nnonetheless spends excessive resources isolating children with disabilities in PRTFs. This\nexact practice was recentlycalled out bya state representative who stated: “[North\nCarolina] [is] ruining people’s live, and we’re doing it in the most expensive way\npossible . . . . It’s inhumane and irresponsible. It is a government failure.”\n4. PRTFs are designed to provide intensive, short-term, residential psychiatric\ntreatment for temporary stabilization. They are generally unsuitable as a long-term “place\nto live,” but that does not stop DHHS from allowing children to languish there for\nextended periods of time. Unsurprisingly, research shows that children with disabilities\nconfined to PRTFs suffer much worse outcomes than non-institutionalized children.\nThese outcomes include spending longer periods of time in child welfare custody without\na permanent home; losing critical familyconnections with parents, siblings, and extended\nfamilydue to their confinement; and experiencing higher rates of maltreatment while in\nchild welfare custody.\n2\nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 1   Filed 12/06/22   Page 2 of 73\n\n5. Moreover, children with disabilities in foster care regularly face trauma\nwithin PRTFs. They are often confined to prison-like settings under the care of a poorly\ntrained and understaffed workforce, where they are subject to broken bones, sprains,\nbruises, and dangerous physical and chemical restraints; withstand sexual and physical\nabuse, bullying, and hate speech by both youth and staff; and face mental health\ndeterioration and cocktails of strong psychotropic medications. For instance, the Named\nPlaintiff children in this litigation, referred to by the pseudonyms TimothyB., Flora P.,\nIsabella A., and Steph C., are all receiving heavy cocktails of mind-altering psychotropic\nmedicationswhile at North Carolina PRTFs. Flora P., Isabella A., and Steph C. have been\nsubject to physical restraints; Timothy B. has faced bullying bystaff; Isabella A. has been\nthe target of bullying and sexual harassment; and Steph C. has been airlifted to a hospital\nafter a physical attack knocked him unconscious. Despite these known dangerous\nconditions, DHHS sent at least 572 children in foster care to PRTFs in fiscal year 2020 to\n2021.\n6. Children of color, such as Named Plaintiffs Flora P. and Steph C., bear the\nbrunt of these harms. Black and Brown children are disproportionately represented in\nDHHS’s foster care system in the first instance. And once in the system, Black and\nBrown children with disabilities are disproportionately confined to PRTFs. According to\nDHHS data from fiscal year 2019 to 2020, Black and Brown (including multiracial)\nchildren make up more than 40% of the children on Medicaid confined to PRTFs. When\nyou include children identified as “other,” that number jumps to almost 50%.\n3\nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 1   Filed 12/06/22   Page 3 of 73\n\n7. DHHS has long been aware of the intolerable conditions and other harms\nthat children face within PRTFs. DHHS conducts regular oversight and monitoring of\nPRTFs and catalogues in public reports the substantial abuse and neglect occurring there.\nYet DHHS keeps spending millions of taxpayer dollars to send children in child welfare\ncustody to PRTFs, the verychildren they are in charge of protecting.\n8. Not onlyare children in foster care in North Carolina routinely sent to\nPRTFs unnecessarily, more than a third of those children are sent into PRTFs out of state.\nDHHS ships children of all ages as far away as Utah, Missouri, and Indiana – too far for\ntheir caseworkers to keep an eye on their safety or for their families to visit them.\n9. Overwhelmingly, the children DHHS warehouses in PRTFs would be better\nserved by community placements and, in many instances, should never have been placed\nin a PRTF at all. They can – and should – be living within and treated within their\ncommunities, in family or family-like homes, near their schools and service providers.\n10. A recent USA Today investigation uncovered that North Carolina children\nin foster care “were confined to [lockdown psychiatric] facilities round-the-clock despite\na clinician determining that it was not medically justified, according to a consultant\ndocument and interviews . . . [because] there was nowhere else to put the youngsters. So\nthey locked them away in institutions with strip searches and limited academic\nprograms,” a common “practice [that is] a consequence of the failures in North Carolina’s\nfoster care system.”\n11. North Carolina child welfare administrators admitted to USA Today, while\nmaintaining anonymity for fear of retribution, that a major reason to unnecessarily place\n4\nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 1   Filed 12/06/22   Page 4 of 73\n\nchildren in PRTFs is the lack of available family settings to care for them. “Countysocial\nservice offices have paid to send children to psychiatric residential treatment facilities —\nan option that is supposed to be reserved for kids with severe mental and behavioral\nproblems — even when clinicians recommended against such therapy, they said.”\n12. DHHS’s unnecessary institutionalization of children with disabilities is\nexactlythe sort of unlawful discrimination prohibited by Title II of the Americans with\nDisabilities Act under the Supreme Court’s landmark Olmstead decision, as well as by\nSection 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. See Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581\n(1999). DHHS is legally obligated to administer its services, programs, and activities to\nchildren with disabilities in the most integrated setting appropriate to their needs, 28\nC.F.R § 35.130(d), and is prohibited from unjustifiablyinstitutionalizing and segregating\nchildren in PRTFs. See Olmstead, 527 U.S. at 587.\n13. DHHS’s failure to provide community-based placement and treatment\noptions for children and youth with disabilities in foster care fuels its overreliance on\nPRTFs. Despite a cost of $100 million per year, DHHS has increased its reliance on\npsychiatric residential treatment facilities since 2010 – instead of building up and\nexpanding appropriate community-based family placements (relative or kinship families\nand non-relative foster families) and supportive mental and behavioral health treatment\nservices.\n14. While DHHS ostensibly offers an array of community-based placements\nand services, the availabilityof needed services is too limited, and DHHS does not ensure\nthat children with disabilities in foster care can actually access existing services. For\n5\nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 1   Filed 12/06/22   Page 5 of 73\n\ninstance, DHHS acknowledges the significant barriers to accessing services in North\nCarolina, such as shortages or waitlists for intensive in-home services, crisis intervention\nservices, outpatient mental health and substance abuse services, and inadequate\ntransportation to and from such services. In light of their insufficient community-based\noptions, DHHS unnecessarily sends foster children to PRTFs to languish there for\nextended periods of time, and cycles children in and out of PRTFs – when DHHS should\nonly use PRTFs in rare situations as short-term treatment and never as a place to live\nbecause it has nowhere else to put them.\n15. The DHHS failure to expand its community-based placements and services\nfor foster children and youth with disabilities is particularly confounding and disturbing\nbecause it is well-established that community-based placements are more effective, yield\nbetter outcomes for children, and are less costly.\n16. According to a consultant hired by DHHS in 2020, “North Carolina spends\na disproportionate amount of its resources on institutional and congregate care settings”\nand “spends more to serve individuals in congregate care settings than it spends on\ncommunity-integrated service options.” Use of community-based placements and\nservices would alleviate the profound waste of North Carolina tax payer funds on harmful\ninstitutional settings that cost at least hundreds of dollars a day.\n17. The DHHS placement and services crisis for children is so dire that it was\nreported in September of 2022 that local Division of Social Services (“DSS”) offices,\nagents of DHHS, are “boarding children in their offices or leaving children with\nemotional and behavioral health needs in emergency rooms after hospitals have released\n6\nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 1   Filed 12/06/22   Page 6 of 73\n\nthem because there was nowhere else to place them” and, according to one high-level\nDHHS official, “their appropriate level of placement has not been located.” The official\nwent on to acknowledge that North Carolina’s child welfare system “is in crisis” and “at\nany point there could be a massive class-action lawsuit.”\n18. This civil rights action seeks only declarative and prospective injunctive\nrelief on behalf of Named Plaintiff children Timothy B., Flora P., Isabella A., and Steph\nC. through their Guardians ad Litem Robert Ward, Esq. and Dr. Jeffrey C. Holden, Ph.D.,\nand a class of similarly situated North Carolina youth with mental impairments in foster\ncare (“the putative class”), as well as Associational Plaintiffs Disability Rights North\nCarolina and the North Carolina State Conference of NAACP, for DHHS’s violations of\nTitle II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”), 42 U.S.C. § 12101 et. seq.,\nSection 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794 et. seq., and their implementing\nregulations.\n19. Plaintiffs are North Carolina children with disabilities in foster care who\nhave been removed from their families and communities and are placed in, or at serious\nrisk of placement in, a PRTF. Often they have unnecessarily spent much of their\nchildhood languishing in these facilities, despite yearning to be in the community. By\nbeing unnecessarily confined to these facilities, theyhave been denied essential\nopportunities for healthy childhood development, such as living in a loving, supportive,\nfamilysetting with community-based services, building intimate relationships with\ntrusted adults, exploring chosen passions and hobbies, and developing necessary\nindependent living skills. They also miss out on educational, employment, and social\n7\nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 1   Filed 12/06/22   Page 7 of 73\n\nopportunities with their nondisabled peers. In short, DHHS – the very agency that exists\nto support and protect these children – is denying them their childhood.\n20. Plaintiffs challenge DHHS’s systemic failures to ensure that children with\ndisabilities in foster care are cared for in the most integrated community-based setting\nappropriate to their needs, and that children in PRTFs are timely and appropriately\ndischarged to such settings. Plaintiffs seek to remedy DHHS’s ongoing statutory\nviolations on behalf of children who are entitled to be, and deserve to be, safely cared for\nin their communities.\nJURISDICTION AND VENUE\n21. This class action for declaratoryand prospective injunctive relief only is\nbrought to address Defendant’s ongoing deprivations of rights guaranteed byfederal\nstatutory law under Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”), 42 U.S.C.\n§§ 12131-12134, and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. § 794.\n22. The Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28\nU.S.C. §§ 1331 (federal question jurisdiction) and 1343(a)(3) (civil rights jurisdiction).\n23. Plaintiffs’ claims for declaratory and injunctive relief are authorized by\n28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 and 2202 as well as Rules 57 and 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil\nProcedure.\n24. Venue is appropriate in the United States District Court for the Middle\nDistrict of North Carolina pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(2), because a substantial part\nof the events and omissions giving rise to the claims herein occurred in this District. For\n8\nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 1   Filed 12/06/22   Page 8 of 73\n\ninstance, one Named Plaintiff is currentlyunnecessarilyconfined to a facility located in\nHoke County, located in this District. Two Named Plaintiffs are in the custody of\nDefendant’s agents in Montgomery County and Orange County, both of which are\nlocated in this District. Further, Defendant’s agents maintain places of business in this\nDistrict.\nPARTIES\nI. Disability Rights North Carolina as Associational Plaintiff\n25. Plaintiff Disability Rights North Carolina (“DRNC”) is an independent\nnon-profit corporation organized under the laws of the State of North Carolina with\noffices in the State of North Carolina located at 3724 National Drive, Suite 100, Raleigh,\nN.C. 27612.\n26. DRNC is a Protection and Advocacy system (“P&A”), as that term is\ndefined under the Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act, 42\nU.S.C. § 15041 et seq.; the Protection and Advocacy for Individuals with Mental Illness\nAct of 1986, 42 U.S.C. § 10801 et seq.; and the Protection and Advocacy of Individual\nRights Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794e et seq.\n27. As the P&A for the state of North Carolina, DRNC is specifically\nauthorized, and its primary function is, to pursue legal, administrative, and other\nappropriate remedies or approaches to ensure the protection of, and advocacy for, the\nrights of individuals with disabilities. 42 U.S.C. § 15043(a)(2)(A)(i).\n9\nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 1   Filed 12/06/22   Page 9 of 73\n\n28. All people with disabilities in North Carolina, including the individual\nNamed Plaintiff children and members of the putative class in this action, are constituents\nof DRNC and have standing to sue in their own right.\n29. Pursuing and protecting the rights of children with disabilities to live and\nreceive services in the communityand to be free from abuse and neglect is germane to\nDRNC’s purpose.\n30. In this case, Plaintiff DRNC challenges Defendant’s patterns, customs,\npolicies, and/or practices, and the resulting discriminatory and unnecessary segregation\nand institutionalization of children with disabilities in foster care in PRTFs. Plaintiff\nDRNC seeks solely declarative and prospective injunctive relief, and no individual\nremedies.\n31. DRNC is accountable to members of the disability community. DNRC\nmaintains a governance structure that ensures the P&A is reflective of and responsive to\nthe disability community. See 42 U.S.C. § 15043 (detailing program requirements); 42\nU.S.C. § 10805 (detailing program requirements); 34 C.F.R. § 381.10(a) (detailing\nprogram requirements). More than half of DRNC’s board of directors and advisory\ncouncil members are individuals with disabilities or family members, guardians, or\nadvocates for individuals with disabilities. DRNC conducts annual surveys of the\ndisabilitycommunity to determine the specific areas of advocacyon which the\norganization will focus. Members of the disability community have the right to file\ngrievances if they disagree with actions taken by DRNC or are wrongly denied services\nby DRNC.\n10\nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 1   Filed 12/06/22   Page 10 of 73\n\nII. North Carolina State Conference of NAACP as Associational Plaintiff\n32. Plaintiff North Carolina State Conference of NAACP (“NC NAACP”) is a\ngrassroots and membership based nonprofit civil rights organization. The NC NAACP\nwas established in 1938 as a state conference branch of the National Association for the\nAdvancement of Colored People (“NAACP”), a national civil rights organization. It is the\noldest and largest civil rights organization in North Carolina, with nearly 100 active\nbranches in urban and rural communities throughout the state.\n33. The NC NAACP’s mission is to ensure the rights of all persons to equality\nand to eliminate racial discrimination. It dedicates significant organizational resources to\nprotecting and advancing civil rights and racial justice for African Americans, people of\ncolor, and other groups of people historically denied those rights in North Carolina.1\n34. Protecting the rights of children of color in foster care to live and receive\nservices in their communities, rather than unnecessarily confined to PRTFs, and be free\nfrom all forms of discrimination, including unnecessary segregation and denial of\ncommunity-based placements and supportive services, is germane to NC NAACP’s\npurpose. The national NAACP has also stressed the urgency of addressing the\noverrepresentation of African American children in the foster care system and ensuring\n1 This has included, for instance, regularlyengaging in voting equality efforts to ensure\nthat African American children are not victims of racial discrimination or\ndisproportionality, afforded equal protection under the law, and are not discriminated\nagainst by government agencies.\n11\nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 1   Filed 12/06/22   Page 11 of 73\n\nthat theyreceive equal and necessary health services, including community-based mental\nhealth services.\n35. In this case, Plaintiff NC NAACP challenges Defendant’s patterns,\ncustoms, policies, and/or practices—and the resulting discriminatory and unnecessary\nsegregation and institutionalization of children with disabilities in foster care in PRTFs—\nwhich violates their rights under the ADA and Rehabilitation Act.\n36. African American and children of color within the putative class, such as\nFlora P. and Steph C., are constituents of NC NAACP.\n37. The NC NAACP also has over 20,000 paid members who registered, on\nbehalf of themselves and their families, to stand up against racial disparities. This is the\nlargest number of members of any NAACP state conference in the South, and the second\nlargest in the country. Named Plaintiffs TimothyB., Flora P., and Steph C. are youth\nmembers of the NC NAACP.\n38. Named Plaintiffs who are constituents and members of NC NAACP have\nstanding to sue in their own right. These Named Plaintiffs suffered harms that result from\nand are traceable to the conduct and inaction of DHHS. Guardian ad Litem Robert Ward\nis a member of the NC NAACP, and Guardian ad Litem Dr. Holden is a member of the\nNAACP.\n39. Many of NC NAACP’s members are also actively engaged as parents,\nfamily members, and informal family members, such as God-parents or community\nparents, of children who are presently in foster care placements. Some of these children\n12\nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 1   Filed 12/06/22   Page 12 of 73\n\nhave, in the past and/or presently, been unnecessarily placed in harmful PRTFs or remain\nat risk of such placement due to Defendant’s failures.\n40. For these reasons, the NC NAACP is uniquely situated to seek legal\nprotections for African American children and children of racial minorities with\ndisabilities who are or remain at risk of placement in PRTFs, and are unable to\nindependently assert or seek legal protections or to provide the Court with information\ncontextualizing the severityof the injuryimposed bytheir unnecessary and segregated\nplacement in these facilities.\nIII. Named Plaintiffs and Guardians ad Litem2\nA. Named Plaintiff Timothy B.\n41. Timothy B. is a 14-year-old child with disabilities in the custody of\nDHHS’s agent, Robeson County DSS, who is unnecessarily institutionalized in a PRTF.\n42. Timothy B. is a member of the Lumbee Tribe of North Carolina and a\nyouth member of the NC NAACP.\n43. Timothy B. is a constituent of DRNC.\n44. Timothy B. has DSM-V diagnoses that substantially limit one or more\nmajor life activity, including self-care, learning, concentrating, thinking, interacting with\nothers, and the operation of the major bodily function of the brain.\n2 The Named Plaintiffs’ names listed in this complaint are pseudonyms to protect their\nidentities. Plaintiffs are filing a motion contemporaneously herewith seeking permission\nto use these pseudonyms in the litigation. Plaintiffs are also filing a Motion for\nAppointment of Guardians ad Litem contemporaneously herewith.\n13\nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 1   Filed 12/06/22   Page 13 of 73\n\n45. When he was very young, DHHS removed Timothy B. from his mother’s\nhouse. In or around 2019, Timothy B. moved from his father’s home and returned to his\nmother’s house.\n46. In February of 2020, agents of DHHS placed Timothy B. at a PRTF in\nRaeford, NC. Now, almost three years later, he continues to live in that PRTF in\ndeplorable conditions, through the present. TimothyB.’s room is totally bare, with only a\ngreen pad as a mattress, no mattress cover, one pillow, and a blanket. There is no\nfurniture in his room. Timothy B. has nowhere to keep private paperwork and has had\nstaff throw out items that were important to him.\n47. The PRTF is primarily made up of one common room, where children\nspend almost all of their time. Children eat all of their meals, attend school, meet with\nvisitors, and do all of their socializing in the same small room.\n48. Timothy B. has been placed on a powerful cocktail of psychotropic\nmedications while at the PRTF. He is subject to polypharmacy, which is an outlier\nprescription practice that consists of the concurrent administration to children of multiple\npsychotropic medications. He is currentlytaking Prozac, Risperdal, and other\nmedications he cannot name.\n49. Timothy B. has been the target of bullying from staff while at the PRTF,\nincluding being called “crybaby,” “b*tch,” and other derogatory terms.\n50. While at the PRTF, it took months before Timothy B. received a\npsychological evaluation.\n14\nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 1   Filed 12/06/22   Page 14 of 73\n\n51. As a child in the custody of child welfare, Timothy B. is categorically\neligible for Medicaid-funded services in the community and may be eligible for\nadditional state-funded services.\n52. Placement in the communitywith community-based mental and behavioral\nhealth services is appropriate for Timothy B.\n53. Timothy B. receives one short individual therapy session per week at which\nTimothy B. and his therapist typicallytalk through a worksheet. Timothy B. also meets\nwith a psychiatrist for about 15 minutes once a week on Tuesdays. These services can be\nprovided in the community.\n54. The PRTF has repeatedly talked with Timothy B. about transitioning him to\na lower level of care but also tells him at his monthly child and family team meetings that\n“nobody’s accepting you, see you again next month.”\n55. Timothy B. has repeatedly stated that he does not feel safe at the PRTF.\n56. While Timothy B. has been at the PRTF, DHHS has cited the facilityfor\nfailing to ensure that youth receive judicial review hearings to which they are statutorily\nentitled. DHHS also found that staff cursed at and picked on the residents, that one staff\nmember had a former conviction of assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill, and\nthat one staff member was suspended for talking about guns and drinking within earshot\nof residents.\n57. Timothy B. has expressed multiple times that he wishes to leave the PRTF\nand live with his grandmother. At a recent child and familyteam meeting, when he was\nasked “what’s not working,” he said, “I’m still at the PRTF.”\n15\nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 1   Filed 12/06/22   Page 15 of 73\n\n58. Timothy B. wants to live in the community with appropriate services and\nsupports. He would like to participate in normal, adolescent activities such as playing\nsports, shopping, being with family, and going to a grocery store. But he is forced to live\na regimented and segregated life at the PRTF. He is restricted from attending school in\nthe community or interacting with nondisabled peers.\n59. DHHS can accommodate Timothy B. in the community through its existing\narrayof home and community-based placements and services.\n60. Timothy B. brings this action through his Guardian ad Litem Robert Ward.\nB. Named Plaintiff Flora P.\n61. Flora P. is a fifteen-year-old child with disabilities in the custody of\nDHHS’s agent, Orange County DSS, who is unnecessarily institutionalized in a PRTF.\n62. Flora P. is African American and a youth member of the NC NAACP.\n63. Flora P. is a constituent of DRNC.\n64. Flora P.’s diagnoses include Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (“PTSD”),\nDisruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder (“DMDD”), and Attention Deficit\nHyperactivity Disorder (“ADHD”). These diagnoses substantially limit one or more\nmajor life activity, including self-care, learning, concentrating, interacting with others,\nand the operation of the major bodily function of the brain.\n65. Flora P. was first in the foster care system as a toddler. She was adopted at\nage three but then reentered the child welfare system as a teenager, after her adoptive\nparents divorced and later abandoned her.\n16\nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 1   Filed 12/06/22   Page 16 of 73\n\n66. Flora P. is currently confined to a PRTF in Leland, NC, where she has been\nsince February 2022.\n67. While at the PRTF, Flora P. has been subject to polypharmacy. She is\ncurrently placed on a powerful cocktail of psychotropic medications, including\nTrazadone, Trileptal, and others she cannot recall. She has been subjected to both\nphysical and chemical restraints that have physically harmed her.\n68. As a child in the custody of child welfare, Flora P. is categorically eligible\nfor Medicaid-funded services in the community and may be eligible for additional state-\nfunded services.\n69. Placement in the communitywith community-based mental and behavioral\nhealth services is appropriate for Flora P.\n70. Flora P. was recommended for a Level III Group Home placement in the\ncommunity about four months ago, but she has lingered at a PRTF because there is no\nopening for her in a Level III placement.\n71. Flora P. wants to return to the community with appropriate services and\nsupports. She would like to live with less people, and she hopes to have more privacyand\nautonomy. Her healthy coping mechanisms include spending time outside and alone, but\nshe cannot freely do those things in a crowded, locked PRTF setting.\n72. Because DHHS is confining Flora P. to a PRTF, she cannot participate in\nnormal, adolescent activities that she enjoys, such as cooking for the homeless; baking\ncakes, cupcakes, and cookies; and pursuing her goal to become a businesswoman in the\nfuture.\n17\nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 1   Filed 12/06/22   Page 17 of 73\n\n73. DHHS can accommodate Flora P. in the community through its existing\narrayof home and community-based placements and services.\n74. Flora P. brings this action through her Guardian ad Litem Robert Ward.\nC. Named Plaintiff Isabella A.\n75. Isabella A. is a 13-year-old child with disabilities in the custody of DHHS’s\nagent, Montgomery County DSS, who is unnecessarily institutionalized in a PRTF.\n76. Isabella A. is a constituent of DRNC.\n77. Isabella A.’s diagnoses include PTSD, ADHD, and DMDD. These\ndiagnoses substantially limit one or more major life activities, including self-care,\nlearning, concentrating, interacting with others, and the operation of the major bodily\nfunction of the brain.\n78. Isabella A. is in foster care in the care and custody of MontgomeryCounty\nDSS.\n79. Isabella A.’s childhood has been marked by instability. During her five\nyears in foster care in DSS custody, DHHS’s agent has shuffled Isabella A. among over\n20 placements, including at least three highly restrictive PRTFs.\n80. At one point in spring 2022, Isabella A. was without any placement and\nspent several days living and sleeping in the conference room of a DSS office. The office\nis not equipped or intended for children to stay in overnight; cots were brought in for\nchildren to sleep on, and Isabella A. had to walk to another building nearby to shower.\n18\nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 1   Filed 12/06/22   Page 18 of 73\n\n81. Isabella A. is currently confined in a PRTF in Jacksonville, N.C., where she\nhas been since July 2022.\n82. While at the PRTF, Isabella A. has been subject to a physical restraint and\nis currently subject to polypharmacy.\n83. The conditions at the PRTF can be punitive in nature, with many arbitrary\nrules that children would not experience in a family environment. Isabella A. has limited\nchances to engage in developmentally-appropriate activities that other adolescents\nregularly do, such as developing relationships with friends of her choosing; or freely\nengaging in her hobbies and coping mechanisms, such as coloring, drawing, listening to\nmusic, and playing cards. She can only spend limited amounts of time outside because\nshe does not have enough warm winter clothes.\n84. At the PRTF, Isabella A. has been the target of bullying behavior, including\npainful sexual harassment, from peers. While Isabella A. has been at the PRTF, it has\nbeen cited by DHHS for staff failing to appropriately supervise children, such that suicide\nattempts, fighting, and serious injuries occur.\n85. As a child in the custody of child welfare, Isabella A. is categorically\neligible for Medicaid-funded services in the community and may be eligible for\nadditional state-funded services.\n86. Placement in the communitywith community-based mental and behavioral\nhealth services is appropriate for Isabella A. She was previously placed in several\ncommunity-based TFC homes. At her most recent TFC placement, DHHS did not\n19\nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 1   Filed 12/06/22   Page 19 of 73\n\nprovide timely therapy upon placement, intensive in-home services, or additional wrap\naround services to support her placement in the community.\n87. Isabella A. is currently receiving weekly individual therapy, bi-weekly\nfamilytherapy with a DSS social worker and her attorney, “recreational” therapy on\nWednesdays and Thursdays, and group therapy on Monday, Tuesday, and Friday – all of\nwhich can be provided in the community.\n88. Isabella A. wants to live in the community with appropriate services and\nsupports and attend a traditional school. She has repeatedly expressed a desire to be freed\nfrom the PRTF, as she believes the confinement is not onlyunhelpful, but actively\nharmful.\n89. DHHS can accommodate Isabella A. in the community through its existing\narrayof home and community-based placements and services.\n90. Isabella A. brings this action through her Guardian ad Litem Dr. Holden.\nD. Named Plaintiff Steph C.\n91. Steph C. is a 15-year-old child with disabilities in the care and custody of\nDHHS’s agent, Craven County DSS, who is unnecessarily institutionalized in a PRTF.\n92. Steph C. is African American and a youth member of the NC NAACP.\n93. Steph C. is a constituent of DRNC.\n94. Steph C.’s diagnoses include PTSD, DMDD, Borderline Intellectual\nFunctioning, ADHD, and Conduct Disorder. Steph C. is substantially limited in one or\n20\nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 1   Filed 12/06/22   Page 20 of 73\n\nmore major life activities, including self-care, learning, and interacting with others and\nthe operation of the major bodily function of the brain.\n95. Steph C.’s childhood has been marked by instability due to DHHS’s agents’\nfailure to provide an appropriate placement and services for him. In the eight years since\nhis removal due to alleged domestic violence and physical abuse, DHHS’s agents have\nshuffled him through over 50 different placements. These placements have included\nseveral group homes and at least 7 different PRTFs throughout the state.\n96. Steph C. is currently confined to a PRTF in Kinston, N.C., where he has\nbeen since April 2022.\n97. While at the PRTF, Steph C. has been subject to repeated physical abuse by\npeers and has suffered at least two serious head injuries. Steph C. was airlifted to a\nhospital trauma center after another youth at the PRTF slammed his head to the ground,\ncausing him to lose consciousness. On a separate occasion, Steph C. suffered a head\ninjury from an assault by another youth at the PRTF and ended up in the Emergency\nRoom. Staff at the PRTF have since moved Steph C. to a unit with much younger\nchildren, ostensibly for his safety.\n98. Steph C. has also been subjected to physical restraints and polypharmacy\nwhile at NOVA. He is on a powerful cocktail of multiple psychotropic medications.\n99. As a child in the custody of child welfare, Steph C. is categoricallyeligible\nfor Medicaid-funded services in the community and may be eligible for additional state-\nfunded services.\n21\nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 1   Filed 12/06/22   Page 21 of 73\n\n100. Placement in the communitywith community-based mental and behavioral\nhealth services is appropriate for Steph C.\n101. The PRTF has told Steph C. of plans to discharge Steph C. to a lower level\nof care multiple times, but he has remained at the facility.\n102. Agents of DHHS have sought to place Steph C. in a community-based\nsetting; they have initiated the Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children process\nto place him out-of-state with is biological aunt.\n103. Steph C. has previously lived in several different community-based\nplacements with community-based treatment, such as outpatient therapy and intensive in-\nhome therapy. Steph C. had an over one-year period of stability living with a foster\nparent in a specialized therapeutic foster home.\n104. Steph C. wants to live in the community with appropriate services and\nsupports. He has repeatedlyexpressed a desire to live in a family home with his\nbiological aunt.\n105. DHHS can accommodate Steph C. in the community through its existing\narrayof home and community-based placements and services.\n106. Steph C. brings this action through his Guardian ad Litem Dr. Holden.\nE. Guardian ad Litem Robert Ward\n107.

KodyKinsleyis the current Secretary of the North Carolina Department of\nHealth and Human Services and is sued in his official capacityonly.\n116. According to DHHS, “as Secretary, Kinsley oversees a department that has\nbroad responsibility for all aspects of health and human services, a staff of 18,000 and an\nannual budget of $26 billion.”\n117. DHHS and Secretary Kinsley in his official capacityare legally responsible\nfor compliance with the ADA and Rehabilitation Act for the Plaintiffs and putative class,\nincluding for the policies, customs, patterns, and practices alleged in this complaint.\n118. DHHS is a principal department of the North Carolina Executive Branch\nwith wide-ranging functions, powers, duties, and obligations. DHHS, by and through its\nvarious divisions, oversees and operates all aspects of the North Carolina child welfare\nsystem. The DSS (Division of Social Services) within DHHS supervises and provides\ntechnical assistance to county DSS offices, which make placement decisions for youth in\nfoster care, including PRTF placement. The Division of Health Services Regulation\n(“DHSR”) within DHHS monitors and oversees all licensed mental health facilities in\nNorth Carolina, including PRTFs. DHHS administers North Carolina’s statewide\nMedicaid program (“NC Medicaid”) through its Division of Health Benefits. DHHS also\n24\nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 1   Filed 12/06/22   Page 24 of 73\n\noversees mental health and developmental disability services, including treatment at\nPRTFs, through its Division of Mental Health, Developmental Disabilities, and\nSubstance Abuse Services (“DMH/DD/SAS”). This division is also responsible for\nensuring that high-quality mental health and developmental disability services are\navailable to people that need them. The DMH/DD/SAS division contains the statutorily-\ncreated Commission for Mental Health, Developmental Disabilities and Substance Abuse\nServices, which has the authorityto adopt and repeal rules pertaining to all mental health\nprograms, including operating standards for licensed mental health facilities such as\nPRTFs.\n119. DHHS has non-delegable direct and ultimate responsibility for the care,\nconditions of custody, placement, and services for all North Carolina youth in foster care,\nincluding the Named Plaintiffs and all members of the putative class.\n120. Secretary Kinsleyenjoys broad statutory authority over DHHS, including\nthe ability to create and eliminate subdivisions within his department and direct\ndepartmental responsibilities to any of his subordinates.\n121. Secretary Kinsleyhas supervision, direction, and control over all DHHS\nemployees.\n122. Secretary Kinsleyhas the power to create or eliminate positions; make\nappointments to, and remove persons from, such positions; transfer officers and\nemployees between positions; and change existing positions’ duties, titles, and\ncompensation.\n25\nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 1   Filed 12/06/22   Page 25 of 73\n\n123. Secretary Kinsleyis responsible for all DHHS managerial functions,\nincluding planning, organizing, staffing, coordinating, reporting, and budgeting. To that\nend, he must prepare and present to the governor an annual report on DHHS’s work,\nDHHS’s planned work for the coming year, and DHHS’s budget request.\n124. Secretary Kinsleyis statutorilyresponsible for supervising the regional-\nand county-level administration of North Carolina’s child welfare system through local\nDSS at the county level. For instance, DHHS must supervise each county’s board of\nsocial services’ establishment of policies. Each county director of social services – who,\namong other things, accepts children for placement and supervises placements – “act[s]\nas [an] agent of . . . [DHHS] . . . in relation to the work required by . . . [DHHS].”\n125. Secretary Kinsleyalso has authority to “adopt and enforce rules” applicable\nto local DSS offices. This includes rules related to “the placement of individuals in\nlicensable facilities located outside the individual’s communityand [the] ability of the\nproviders to return [them] . . . to [their] community as soon as possible without\ndetriment,” and “the monitoring of mental health [and] developmental disability. . .\nservices.”\n126. Secretary Kinsleyhas acknowledged the need to improve North Carolina’s\nmental health system and provide more support to children in DHHS’s care, “specifically\naround kids that are engaged in the foster care system.” He told lawmakers in June 2022\nthat “[u]nfortunately, our children and the behavioral health needs of our kids have\nlanguished in our state for far too long.”\n127. DHHS and its agents maintain offices in all counties located in this District.\n26\nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 1   Filed 12/06/22   Page 26 of 73\n\nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS\n128. Named Plaintiffs Timothy B., Flora P., Isabella A., and Steph C. bring this\naction pursuant to Rule 23(a) and (b)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure on behalf\nof themselves and a putative class of similarly situated children.\n129. Putative Class: All Plaintiffs seek to represent a Class defined as all\nchildren that meet the following criteria now or during the pendency of this action:\n(a)childrenwhoareor will bein NorthCarolina fostercare,3whoare orwill\nbe in the custody of a North Carolina county department of social services;4\n(b) with a mental impairment that substantially limits at least one major life\nactivity, or a record of such an impairment; (c) who are unnecessarily\ninstitutionalized in a PRTF or who are at serious risk of such\ninstitutionalization.5\n130. Numerosity. The putative class is sufficiently numerous to make joinder of\nall its members impracticable. During North Carolina’s Fiscal Years 2018 to 2022, there\nwere at least 1,900 paid Medicaid claims to place North Carolina children in foster care\nin PRTFs. State data shows that as of November 2021, over a one-year period, 572\nchildren involved with North Carolina’s child welfare system were placed in PRTFs. This\nrepresents an increase compared to previous years. The increase is compounded bythe\nongoing lack of adequate community-based treatment and services available in North\nCarolina. These factors mean that even more children in foster care are at risk of future\nplacement in PRTFs.\n3 See N.C. Gen. Stat. § 7B-903(a)(6).\n4 See N.C. Gen. Stat. § 7B-101(8a).\n5 Children at serious risk of unnecessary institutionalization in a PRTF include children\nwith a mental health or behavioral health diagnosis(es) who, for instance, were previously\ninstitutionalized or placed in a restrictive care setting such as a PRTF.\n27\nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 1   Filed 12/06/22   Page 27 of 73\n\n131. Additionally, children in foster care in North Carolina move with extreme\nfrequency among placements, including in and out of PRTFs and from PRTF to PRTF.\nThis makes joinder of all class members even more impractical because of the fluid and\ninherently transitory nature of the putative class members’ experience in child welfare\ncustody. For instance, Named Plaintiff Isabella A. has been shuffled among over 20\nplacements during her five years in foster care, and Named Plaintiff Steph C. has\nexperienced over 50 different placements over the past eight years, including at least 7\nPRTF placements. From 2015 to 2016, youth in foster care in North Carolina experienced\n2.1 placements moves per 1,000 days in care. In 2019, North Carolina’s rate of placement\nmoves per 1,000 days in foster care was over 5.9 moves, worse than the national\nperformance standard of 4.1.\n132. Thus, as a result of this instability and the lack of sufficient community-\nbased placements and supportive services, and as set forth herein, many additional\nchildren with disabilities in foster care are at serious risk of placement in PRTFs.\n133. Joinder is also impracticable because Class members lack the knowledge\nand financial means to maintain individual actions.\n134. Commonality. The common questions of law and fact shared bythe Named\nPlaintiffs and the putative class they seek to represent include:\na. Whether Defendant has a pattern, custom, policy, and/or practice of\nadministering its programs in a manner that results in the unnecessary\nsegregation of children in the putative class in PRTFs.\n28\nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 1   Filed 12/06/22   Page 28 of 73\n\nb. Whether Defendant has a pattern, custom, policy, and/or practice of\nadministering its programs in a manner and through methods that result\nin the unnecessary segregation of children in the putative class by\nfailing to plan for, develop, operate, and fund a sufficient array of\ncommunity-based supports, including community-based placements and\nsupportive mental and behavioral health services, for children in foster\ncare and their caregivers that would allow children in the putative class\nto live in integrated settings.\nc. Whether Defendant has a pattern, custom, policy, and/or practice of\nadministering its programs in a manner and through methods that result\nin the failure to transition or timely transition children in the putative\nclass out of PRTFs and into stable, integrated community-based\nplacements when they are ready for discharge.\nd. Whether Defendant’s patterns, customs, policies, and/or practices with\nrespect to the putative class violate Title II of the Americans with\nDisabilities Act.\ne. Whether Defendant’s patterns, customs, policies and/or practices with\nrespect to the putative class violate Section 504 of the Rehabilitation\nAct.\n135. Typicality. The claims of the Named Plaintiffs are typical of the legal\nviolations and harms suffered byall Class Members. The Named Plaintiffs are members\n29\nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 1   Filed 12/06/22   Page 29 of 73\n\nof the putative class who have been confined to PRTFs despite the appropriateness of\ncommunity-based placements and services and their desire to be treated in the\ncommunity. Theyare also all subject to or at serious risk of being subjected to the\npatterns, customs, policies and/or practices identified in this complaint with respect to the\nputative class. The Named Plaintiffs are entitled to the same injunctive and declaratory\nrelief that addresses these policies and practices for the putative class.\n136. Adequacy of Representation. The Named Plaintiffs will fairly and\nadequatelyprotect the interests of the entire Class. The Named Plaintiffs are seeking only\nsystemic relief that will benefit all members of the putative class. There are no known\nconflicts of interest between the Named Plaintiffs and the members of the putative class\nthey seek to represent.\n137. The Guardians ad Litem Robert Ward and Dr. Holden are truly dedicated to\nrepresenting the best interests of the Named Plaintiffs that they represent. The Guardians\nad Litem are both familiar with the harms experienced bythe Named Plaintiffs and the\nclaims in this litigation.\n138. Plaintiffs’ counsel are:\na. Attorneys from DRNC, North Carolina’s federally mandated Protection\nand Advocacyagency;\nb. Attorneys from Children’s Rights, a national non-profit children’s\nadvocacyorganization;\nc. Attorneys from the NC NAACP, a North Carolina civil rights advocacy\norganization; and\n30\nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 1   Filed 12/06/22   Page 30 of 73\n\nd. Attorneys from Moore & Van Allen, PLLC, a full-service law firm\nheadquartered in Charlotte, NC, acting as pro bono counsel.\n139. Plaintiffs’ attorneys are well-suited to fairly and adequately represent the\ninterests of the putative class. These attorneys have experience litigating complex class\nactions in federal court, including civil rights litigation and specific litigation with respect\nto the foster care system, disabilities, and government system failures. Plaintiffs’\nattorneys have also committed sufficient resources to represent the putative class.\n140. As detailed throughout this complaint, the Defendant has acted or refused\nto act on grounds generally applicable to the putative class, thereby making final\ninjunctive and declaratory relief appropriate with respect to the putative class as a whole\nunder Rule 23(b)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n141. The injuries of the putative class can be redressed by a single injunctive and\ndeclaratory judgement that declares DHHS’s conduct unlawful and orders DHHS to: end\nits unlawful methods of administration and unnecessary segregation of children with\ndisabilities in foster care in PRTFs; increase its capacity to serve the needs of children\nwith disabilities in foster care in community-based placements with mental and\nbehavioral health services in the community; and timely transition children in foster care\nplaced in PRTFs out of PRTFs into community-based placements with supportive\nservices.\n31\nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 1   Filed 12/06/22   Page 31 of 73\n\nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS\nV. Defendant Has Responsibility for Administering and Overseeing All\nAspects of the Child Welfare System in North Carolina\n142. DHHS is the designated single state agency responsible for administering\nand overseeing all child welfare services in North Carolina. 42 U.S.C. § 621; N.C. Gen.\nStat. § 108A-71 & -74.\n143. DHHS “is responsible for ensuring the health, safety and well-being of all\nNorth Carolinians.”\n144. DHHS also “manages the delivery of health- and human-related services\nfor all North Carolinians, especially[its] most vulnerable citizens – children.”\n145. DHHS is required by federal law to administer all of its services and\nprograms to children in the state in a manner that does not discriminate against children\nwith disabilities. See 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b); 45 C.F.R. § 84.4(b)(4).\n146. DHHS has the direct, ultimate, and non-delegable duty to comply with\nfederal statutory obligations under Title II of the ADA and Section 504 with respect to all\nchildren with disabilities in foster care, including the putative class. As a practical matter,\nDHHS delegates to its county DSS offices many of its day-to-day child welfare functions,\nwhile continuing to directly oversee these functions in a number of ways. Each county\ndirector of social services is the statutorily appointed agent of DHHS for all child welfare\nrelated work carried out in the county. N.C. Gen. Stat. § 108A-14(a). DHHS therefore\ndirects, controls, and is liable for the acts and omissions of county departments of social\nservices, who act as DHHS’s agents in the deliveryof services to children in foster care,\n32\nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 1   Filed 12/06/22   Page 32 of 73\n\nspecifically in arranging for placements and the delivery of services as alleged in this\ncomplaint.\n147. DHHS must take over the provision of child welfare services when its\nagents do not meet their obligations or fail to provide child welfare services in\naccordance with state law. N.C. Gen. Stat. § 108A-74(a3)-(c1), (c) & (h). DHHS has\nexercised this power as recently as May 2022.\n148. North Carolina’s provision of services to children removed from their\nhomes and placed in state custodyby its child welfare agents, as well as other child\nwelfare services, are financed in part byfederal funds distributed under Title IV-E of the\nSocial SecurityAct. As of 2018, these funds financed 42% of North Carolina’s child\nwelfare spending.\n149. To maintain eligibility for such federal funds, North Carolina must have a\nState Plan for administering its foster care system that complies with federal law and\ndesignate a state agency responsible for the administration of the plan.\n150. The North Carolina State Plan includes, among other things, the state’s\nstrategies for:\na. identifying and treating mental health needs of children in foster care;\nb. guaranteeing that children in foster care are not inappropriately\ndiagnosed and institutionalized;\nc. ensuring the appropriate use of medication for children in foster care;\nand\n33\nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 1   Filed 12/06/22   Page 33 of 73\n\nd. guaranteeing face-to-face visits by social workers with children in foster\ncare at least monthly that are focused on the child’s safety, permanency,\nand well-being. 42 U.S.C. § 622.\n151. As the designated single state agency under Title IV-E, DHHS must ensure\nthat the State Plan is “in effect in all political subdivisions of the State, and, if\nadministered by them, be mandatory upon them,” as well as “monitor and conduct\nperiodic evaluations” of the foster care program.\n152. In addition to the explicit principal-agent relationship established by N.C.\nGen. Stat. § 108A-14(a), North Carolina statutes outline a separate scheme by which\nDHHS monitors the counties’ provision of social services. Each year, the Secretary of\nDHHS must require all county departments to enter written performance agreements that\nspecify mandated performance requirements and administrative responsibilities regarding\nsocial service programs, including child welfare. N.C. Gen. Stat. § 108A-74.These\nagreements allow DHHS to withhold funds from the countyoffice if it cannot satisfy\nmandated performance requirements or otherwise comply with the terms of the\nagreement or applicable law. N.C. Gen. Stat. § 108A-74(a3), -74(a2)(4). If a local\ndepartment cannot comply with the terms of the agreement, the mandated performance\nmeasures, or other applicable law, DHHS and the local department must enter a joint\ncorrective action plan. N.C. Gen. Stat. § 108A-74(a3). If a local department cannot\ncomplete the corrective action plan, the Secretary of DHHS may temporarily assume all\nor part of the local department’s services administration. N.C. Gen. Stat. § 108A-74(b).\nDHHS can withhold funds if it determines that a local department is not providing foster\n34\nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 1   Filed 12/06/22   Page 34 of 73\n\ncare services in accordance with state law and the “failure to provide the services poses a\nsubstantial threat to the safety and welfare of children in the county who receive or are\neligible to receive the services.” N.C. Gen. Stat. § 108A-74(h). These agreements\nbetween DHHS and their county DSS agents require DHHS and its agents to provide\nchild welfare services in compliance with all applicable federal and state laws, rules,\nregulations, and policies.\n153. DHHS must also file an annual report to the legislature on its oversight of\nlocal social services programs, including foster care.\n154. Compliance with federal and state law requirements for children in foster\ncare include:\na. Making reasonable efforts, absent an immediate threat of harm, to\nprevent the removal of a child and need for placement elsewhere. See 42\nU.S.C. § 671(a)(15)(B); 45 C.F.R. § 1356.21(b); N.C. Gen. Stat. § 7B-\n507;\nb. Making efforts to place children with relatives, nonrelative kin, former\nfoster parent(s), or other persons in the child’s home community. See 42\nU.S.C. § 671(a)(29); N.C. Gen. Stat. § 7B-505; and\nc. Making arrangements for psychiatric, psychological, or mental health\ncare or treatment and psychotropic medications that are in the child’s\nbest interest. See 42 U.S.C. § 622(b)(15)(A); N.C. Gen. Stat. § 7B-\n505.1.\n35\nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 1   Filed 12/06/22   Page 35 of 73\n\n155. DHHS is also responsible for the oversight and regulation of all licensed\nfacilities throughout the state, including all PRTFs and other facilities providing care for\nchildren. N.C. Gen. Stat. § 122C-27.\n156. DHHS’s oversight responsibility includes inspecting PRTFs on at least an\nannual basis and whenever it otherwise deems inspection necessary.DHHS must also\nconduct unscheduled inspections of any facility subject to a complaint alleging the\nviolation of a PRTF licensing rule. And it must submit an annual report to the legislature\ndetailing compliance of each facility with laws and rules governing the use of restraints\nand seclusion, as well as facility deaths.\n157. DHHS has authority to deny, suspend, amend, or revoke licenses of PRTFs;\ninvestigate allegations of harm occurring at PRTFs; inspect facilities; require regular\nreporting; impose financial penalties; limit or suspend admissions to PRTFs; remove\nchildren from PRTFs; and refuse to place children at PRTFs.\nVI. Defendant Discriminates Against Children with Disabilities in Foster Care\nby Unnecessarily Segregating Themin PRTFs\n158. The ADA recognizes that “society has tended to,” and problematically\n“continue[s] to,” “isolate and segregate individuals with disabilities.” 42 U.S.C.\n§ 12101(a)(2). Thus, regulations passed by Congress implementing Title II of the ADA\nrequire public entities to “administer services, programs, and activities in the most\nintegrated setting appropriate to the needs of qualified individuals with disabilities.” 28\nC.F.R. § 35.130(d). According to the preamble discussion of the regulations, the “most\n36\nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 1   Filed 12/06/22   Page 36 of 73\n\nintegrated setting” means “a setting that enables individuals with disabilities to interact\nwith nondisabled persons to the fullest extent possible.” 28 C.F.R. pt. 35, app. B. Public\nentities must also “make reasonable modifications in [their] policies, practices, or\nprocedures” to avoid disability-based discrimination. 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(7).\n159. Regulations implementing Title II of the ADA further prohibit public\nentities from utilizing “criteria or methods of administration” “[t]hat have the effect of\nsubjecting qualified individuals with disabilities to discrimination” or “[t]hat have the\npurpose or effect of defeating or substantially impairing accomplishment of the\nobjectives of the public entity’s program with respect to individuals with disabilities.” 28\nC.F.R. § 35.130(b)(3); accord 45 C.F.R. § 84.4(b)(4) (Rehabilitation Act).\n160. In the seminal decision Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581 (1999), the United\nStates Supreme Court held that unnecessary institutionalization can constitute unlawful\ndiscrimination under the ADA. Under Olmstead, states must provide community-based\ntreatment for individuals with disabilities when 1) such placement is appropriate, 2) the\naffected persons do not oppose such treatment, and 3) the placement can be reasonably\naccommodated, taking into account the resources available to the State and the needs of\nothers with disabilities. See id. at 607. Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. §\n794, imposes identical requirements on programs and activities that receive federal\nfinancial assistance. See, e.g., 45 C.F.R. § 84.4(b)(2).\n161. Defendant has a pervasive, system-wide practice of unnecessarily\nsegregating children in its care in PRTF institutions instead of providing care and\nplacement for them in their communities. Defendant is discriminating against youth with\n37\nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 1   Filed 12/06/22   Page 37 of 73\n\ndisabilities in foster care byadministering and funding its child welfare programs and\nservices for these youth in a manner that results in their unnecessaryinstitutionalization\nor serious risk of such institutionalization. By failing to provide placements, services, and\nsupports that enable youth with disabilities in foster care to remain in their own homes or\nin integrated family-like settings in the community, Defendant has violated Title II of the\nADA and its implementing regulations.\n162. DHHS and its county DSS agents are responsible for providing children in\nfoster care with a safe, appropriate home and for making arrangements for the appropriate\ncare and treatment of their mental health needs.\n163. According to state law, DHHS and its county DSS agents are specifically\nrequired to prioritize placement of children in foster care in the community, in families\nrather than in institutions. Theyalso must provide them with community-based mental\nand behavioral health services.\n164. Instead, DHHS has an ongoing policy, practice, pattern, and/or custom of\ninappropriately and unnecessarily segregating children with disabilities in foster care in\nPRTFs, rather than placing them in integrated community-based placements with\nsupportive services.\n165. Other youth in foster care with mental impairments are at serious risk of\nentering or returning to a PRTF because of DHHS’s systemic and pervasive failure to\nprovide adequate, appropriate community-based services, as well as its ongoing practices\nof unnecessarily segregating children in foster care in PRTFs and cycling children in\nfoster care through multiple PRTF placements.\n38\nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 1   Filed 12/06/22   Page 38 of 73\n\n166. DHHS also places a substantial number of youth with disabilities in foster\ncare in PRTFs located outside the state of North Carolina, far away from their families,\nexisting community supports, and the agencies responsible for ensuring their safety. A\nUSA TODAY Network investigation found that “abused and neglected children from\nNorth Carolina have been sent as far away as Utah, Missouri, Indiana and other states\neven when psychiatric facilities have been accused of physical and sexual abuse and\nother mistreatment.” Further, USA TODAY reported that “[e]xperts saymanyfamilies\n— often people of color who are struggling financially and living without reliable\ntransportation — cannot visit or check on the well-being of kids” when placed out of\nstate.\n167. As of November 2021, North Carolina officials report that approximately\n40% of youth placed in PRTFs were sent to facilities in other states over a one-year\nperiod. During North Carolina’s Fiscal Years 2018 to 2022, at least 726 Medicaid claims\nwere paid for North Carolina children in foster care in PRTFs located outside the state.\n168. North Carolina has doubled-down on its overreliance of PRTFs. DHHS has\nincreased its reliance on PRTFs at a rate of 119% from 2010 to 2018. As of November\n2021, over 500 children involved with North Carolina’s child welfare system were placed\nin PRTFs over a one-year period, which is more than in previous years.\n169. According to an April 2021 report by a consultant group hired by DHHS,\n“DHHS staff shared their perception that there is an overreliance on residential services\nfor children with behavioral health needs, and that residential treatment facilities are\nviewed as a place for children to live, rather than as a level of treatment.” Further,\n39\nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 1   Filed 12/06/22   Page 39 of 73\n\n“Division of Social Services (DSS) staff shared that children involved with the Child\nWelfare system sometimes remain in a PRTF long after a discharge plan is made because\nthere is no identified placement available for them.” The lack of appropriate community-\nbased placements affects foster children with disabilities across placements and\nthroughout the system: “DHHS also attributed the delay in discharges from state-run\npsychiatric hospitals to the lack of community-based behavioral health services, requiring\npeople to wait in state hospital beds until the community services they needed became\navailable.”\n170. As the state’s consultant summarized to DHHS, “[i]t is important to note\nthat the state’s use of PRTFs has increased, and further work should be done to\nstrengthen access to community-based services to reduce out-of-home placements.”\n171. DHHS’s overreliance on congregate institutions is evidenced by its\nspending practices; more money is spent on PRTFs and other institutional care than on\ncommunity-based programs, even though DHHS admits that community-based programs\nare “better at improving kids’ lives.”\n172. In 2020, DHHS requested that the Technical Assistance Collaborative\n(“TAC”) provide an assessment of how DHHS serves people with disabilities. This\nconsultant’s report concluded that North Carolina spends a “disproportionate” amount of\nits resources on institutional settings and that “[a]dditional community-based service\noptions and capacity are needed for children . . . to reduce reliance on institutional and\ncongregate care settings.”\n40\nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 1   Filed 12/06/22   Page 40 of 73\n\nA. Children with Disabilities in Child Welfare Custody Are Warehoused in\nRestrictive PRTFs and Exposed to Harmful, Non-Therapeutic Conditions\n173. PRTFs are locked, segregated, institutional facilities that are populated\nexclusively with children with disabilities. They necessarily deprive the children within\ntheir walls of opportunities to interact with non-disabled peers in a community-based,\nintegrated setting.\n174. Aside from limited opportunities to receive visits from familyand friends,\nchildren confined to PRTFs have few opportunities to interact with anyone without a\ndisability, other than staff.Children in PRTFs must attend on-site schools. As these on-\nsite schools contain only children with disabilities, theyare not integrated with their\nnondisabled peers. They are also denied the option of participating in community-based\nactivities, such as recreation-league sports, dance classes, music lessons, part-time jobs,\nor school clubs. Instead, it is not uncommon for children’s opportunities for free play and\nfresh air to be time spent within the confines of razor-wire-surrounded recreation yards,\nand for limited periods of time.\n175. Dailylife in a PRTF is typically regimented in a prison-like manner,\ndissimilar to life in the community and antithetical to healthyadolescent development.\nChildren generally share rooms with at least one other peer, have little designated\npersonal space, lack privacy, and are subject to invasive and traumatizing strip searches.\nFor instance, Named Plaintiff Timothy B. spends most of his time in the one common\nroom at the PRTF facility, has little-to-no privacy, and has nowhere to keep his personal\nbelongings. Additionally, children are subjected to rigid, non-individualized behavior\n41\nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 1   Filed 12/06/22   Page 41 of 73\n\nmanagement practices, rather than practices tailored to the child’s individual needs and\ngoals.\n176. In addition to the harms of segregation, children placed in PRTFs\nexperience worse outcomes than their non-institutionalized peers. Social science research\nand evaluations of residential facilities and group homes have confirmed that youth\nplaced in residential facilities spend more time in foster care overall, are less likely to be\nplaced with their siblings, and are less likely to be placed in or near their home\ncommunities. In addition, children placed in residential facilities are at risk of\nexperiencing maltreatment in care. Finally, children placed in these residential facilities\nare less likely to achieve permanency—a safe and legallypermanent family—and\ntherefore are more likely to “age out” of the foster care system without community-based\nsupports to facilitate their successful transition to adulthood. Youth who age out of foster\ncare experience negative outcomes including lower educational achievement, early\nparenthood, homelessness, unemployment, and incarceration.\n177. Placement in PRTFs also prevents already traumatized children with\ndisabilities in foster care from forming meaningful relationships with “buffering”\nadults—trusted adults who serve to buffer and soothe a child’s physiological stress\nresponses. This lack of trusted adult supports can lead to toxic stress. Toxic stress, in\nturn, is associated with physical effects on children’s neural structures, compromised\nbrain development, and increased risk for stress-related disease and cognitive impairment\nwell into adult years. The availability of positive and stable supports is one of the most\n42\nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 1   Filed 12/06/22   Page 42 of 73\n\nimportant factors in promoting resilience in traumatized children, but residential settings\nimpede the formation of these secure adult attachments.\n178. DHHS-licensed PRTFs in North Carolina are “treatment” facilities in name\nand definition. But in reality, theyare typically highly restrictive, locked settings that are\nroutinely dangerous, distressing, and harmful.Their dire conditions often traumatize\nchildren rather than treat them.\n179. USA Today, the Fayetteville Observer, and the Charlotte Observer have all\nrecently reported on the abusive conditions North Carolina children experience in PRTFs.\n180. As the lead investigator for the North Carolina “Locked Away”\ninvestigation publiclyexplained:\nWhatweseeoverandoverinstaterecordsandininterviews withkidsisthat\nkidswill get choked, kidswillhave bonesbroken, kidswill be bruised. They\nwill have elbows and shoulders sprained as workers try to bring them under\ncontrol and there are definitely some cases that are just gross, including, the\nreportthat a15-year-oldboywasrepeatedlypunchedinthefacebyaworker\nand ended up with a broken eye socket and was not taken to the hospital for\nfour days.\n181. Details about the conditions children experience in PRTFs are known to\nDHHS through the work of its DHSR division, which oversees the services provided in\nPRTFs on behalf of DHHS and publishes public reports of its investigations on its\nwebsite through documents known as Statements of Deficiency. Recent examples, within\nthe last four years, of the harm and abuse children experience at taxpayer-funded PRTFs\ninclude: improper physical restraints;inappropriate chemical restraints; inappropriate use\nof psychotropic medication;inhumane living conditions; and sexual,emotional, and\npsychological abuse,including racial and homophobic slurs.\n43\nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 1   Filed 12/06/22   Page 43 of 73\n\n182. Upon information and belief, inappropriate and harmful physical restraints\nare used often by staff in PRTFs, thereby severely limiting the physical libertyof children\nwith disabilities in child welfare custody and routinely injuring them. Inappropriate\nphysical restraints can be dangerous, even deadly. After someone died from the use of a\n“prone” facedown restraint at a DHHS-operated facility in 2012, then-DHHS Secretary\nAlbert Delia ordered that North Carolina providers cease use of prone restraints. These\nrestraints are the same type of restraint that killed 16-year-old Cornelius Frederick in\n2020 while confined to a Michigan foster care facility and the same type of restraint that\nkilled George Floyd. This restraint is also known to be disproportionatelyused on people\nof color and people with disabilities.\n183. Chemical restraints have been inappropriately administered in PRTFs to\nmanage a child’s behavior and/or sedate them. Chemical restraints are restraints\nadministered through chemical means, such as injections of sedatives or psychotropic\nmedications. Just like a physical restraint, a chemical restraint severely limits the physical\nliberty of children with disabilities in child welfare custody and has the potential to cause\nPTSD, flashbacks, nightmares, and intrusive thoughts. Chemical restraints should be used\nas a last resort and with proper oversight from medical professionals – not for\npunishment, discipline, or staff convenience.\n184. DHHS admits that it does not conduct “any monitoring or auditing” of\nPRTFs’ adherence to the state’s psychotropic medication policies.\n185. Additionally, PRTFs housing youth with disabilities in child welfare\ncustody rely on cocktails of powerful psychotropic medications to control children’s\n44\nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 1   Filed 12/06/22   Page 44 of 73\n\nbehavior, again severely limiting the physical libertyof children in child welfare custody\nand frequently harming them. Psychotropic medications are powerful drugs used to alter\na person’s mood, cognition, and/or behaviors. There are serious, sometimes irreversible,\nadverse effects associated with the improper administration of psychotropic drugs,\nincluding: obesity, diabetes, suicidal ideation, uncontrollable movements such as tics or\ntremors, seizures, irreversible movement disorders (such as tardive dyskinesia), and\nthyroid and pancreas damage.\n186. Children with disabilities in foster care are particularly vulnerable to these\nserious harms associated with psychotropic medications. The U.S. Department of Health\nand Human Services’ Office of Inspector General (“OIG”) explained that, “[u]nlike\nchildren from intact families, children in foster care often do not have a consistent\ninterested party to coordinate treatment planning or to provide continuous oversight of\ntheir mental health treatment. Further, responsibility for children in foster care is shared\namong multiple people—foster parents, birth parents, and caseworkers—which creates\nrisk of miscommunication, conflict, and lack of follow-up. Children in foster care may\nalso experience multiple changes in placement and in physicians, which can cause health\ninformation about these children to be incomplete and spread across many sources.\nTherefore, children in foster care may be at risk for inappropriate prescribing practices\n(e.g., too many medications, incorrect dosage, incorrect duration, incorrect indications for\nuse, or inappropriate treatment).”\n187. Hence, the 2015 American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry\n(“AACAP”) recommendations, as well as guidance from the federal Administration for\n45\nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 1   Filed 12/06/22   Page 45 of 73\n\nChildren and Families (“ACF”) and professional organizations, call for collaboration\nbetween child welfare agencies, Medicaid agencies, and mental health agencies to\neffectively monitor the safe administration of psychotropic medication to children with\ndisabilities in foster care. In particular, AACAP calls for the systemic capacity to identify\n“red flag criteria triggering external reviews” and for “[m]andatory consultations with an\nidentified child and adolescent reviewer” in response to such red flags. ACF guidance\nsimilarly calls for systems designed to flag outlier prescriptions, including “instances\nwhere children are prescribed too many psychotropic medications, too much medication,\nor at too young an age: too many, and too much, too young.”\n188. Without this necessary oversight by DHHS, PRTFs commonly subject\nchildren with disabilities in foster care to inappropriate, outlier prescribing practices, such\nas polypharmacy – the concurrent prescription of multiple psychotropic medications to\nchildren. Each of the Named Plaintiffs is currently subject to polypharmacy within\nPRTFs.\n189. Additionally, the following illustrations of conditions within various\nDHHS-licensed PRTFs within the last four years underscore the dire situations to which\nDHHS regularly– and knowingly – exposes children with disabilities in foster care,\nrather than placing them in community-based settings.\n190. At Jackson Springs Treatment Center in West End, some of the children did\nnot have functioning, hygienic bathroom facilities, and all of the facilities were generally\nrun-down and in need of repairs. Sinks did not have handles on faucets and/or were not in\nworking order, showers and bathtubs did not have shower curtains or other options for\n46\nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 1   Filed 12/06/22   Page 46 of 73\n\nprivacy, the bathrooms smelled stronglyof mold and mold was visible throughout. The\nPRTF advertises its “safe, coercive free residential environment.” But according to\nDHSR reports staff restrained children byholding them with their faces “on the wall”;\nhurt them by pulling their arms too far back and continuing to do so after children said\nthey were in pain; and, on one occasion, restrained a child with a cast on his arm. One\nchild suffered an orbital bone fracture and black eye at the hands of PRTF staff (the child\nreported being punched in the face by staff while the staff member claimed the child fell\nafter he failed to properly restrain the child). After the injury, the PRTF did not send the\nchild to the hospital or coordinate medical treatment or, upon information and belief,\ntrain the staff on proper restraint procedures.Facility staff contacted law enforcement at\nleast 42 times over the course of the year, often without taking any steps to address the\nchild’s behavior before involving law enforcement. As of the filing of this complaint,\nDHHS continues to send children in foster care to Jackson Springs Treatment Center.\n191. At Canyon Hills Treatment Facility in Raeford, whose slogan is “giving\nchildren back their childhood,” an eight-year-old child reported that staff “beat on the\nboys.” A nurse confirmed that staff “slap them up and slap them around – on the butt and\nbottom,” and another nurse reported witnessing staff choke a child. A nine-year-old with\nbruises and abrasions across his body reported that a staff member had grabbed him by\nthe shoulder, rubbed spit across his face, and kicked him in the groin. Parents reported\nthat their child was bruised so badlyhe “looked like he had been through a war zone.” At\none point, at least one-third of the children lost weight during their stay, and the children\nbegan circulating a unanimously signed petition for larger portions and better food.In\n47\nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 1   Filed 12/06/22   Page 47 of 73\n\nresponse, the PRTF reduced the children’s food portions as punishment.One child\nreported that a nurse said the PRTF intentionally gave them “a little bit of food” because\n“your stomach will shrink and then you will not be hungry.” A child reported that they\nwere sexually molested while at the PRTF. And staff mocked and harassed children with\nhomophobic terms, calling at least one child a “f-g-ot.” According to a news article by\nthe Charlotte Observer, Canyon Hills employees were “resistant and uncooperative” with\npolice and child protective services’ attempts to speak with children and staff at the\nfacility and refused to allow them to speak with the child who reported the sexual abuse.\nAs of the filing of this complaint, DHHS continues to send children in foster care to\nCanyon Hills Treatment Facility.\n192. At Carolina Dunes Behavioral Health in Leland (formerly Strategic\nBehavioral Center), whose mission is to “Improve the Lives We Touch,” a 12-year-old\nboy less than five feet tall and weighing 94 pounds had his wrist fractured by a 6’6” tall,\n200-pound staff member pressing a door against him. Staff did not report the child’s\ninjury, and a nurse did not examine his wrist when the child first reported it; it was four\ndays before the child was taken to the hospital to stabilize the fracture. Another staff\nmember injured a 13-year-old child so badly that they had to go to the emergency room.\nAnd after a staff was observed kissing a 14-year-old child at the PRTF, the staff admitted\nto inappropriate sexual contact with the child and to not reporting the incident. The child,\nwho was known to self-harm, told DHHS investigators she was in a romantic relationship\nwith the staff member and that she had been sabotaging her treatment to spend more time\nwith the staff. The girl’s therapist described the staff member as a “predator who was\n48\nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 1   Filed 12/06/22   Page 48 of 73\n\ngrooming a 14-year-old.” Additionally, children’s bathrooms were found to be damaged\nand dirty, and some were nonfunctional. There have been numerous medication errors:\nstaff failed to administer medications as ordered by the physician; medication was\nadministered despite there being no order for it; powerful medications were not\nadministered because the facility ran out of it; and documentation failures further\ncomplicated determinations as to whether medications were actually administered and in\nwhat doses. For example, staff administered the antipsychotic Seroquel numerous times\non a single day to a 17-year-old child and later, on a different day, ordered multiple\ndosages of Seroquel without any documentation of these administrations. Staff also have\nfailed to properlydocument the use of medications used as chemical restraints, such as\nthe antipsychotic Thorazine. A child reported that the staff kept “giving me needle\ninjections,” a chemical restraint, while also being secluded. Staff are also known to use\nmultiple chemical restraints or use themafter physical restraints already have been\nattempted. As of the filing of this complaint, DHHS continues to send children in foster\ncare to Carolina Dunes Behavioral Health.\n193. At Hope Gardens Treatment Center in Raeford, where the “team focuses on\nproviding high-quality compassionate behavioral healthcare by utilizing evidenced-based\npractices, and rendering exclusive therapeutic residential treatment methods in a safe,\ncaring environment,” a staff member reported seeing another staff slap a child across the\nface and place his hands around the child’s neck. A police report from the incident stated\nthe child “exhibited difficultyto speak” and was overheard screaming “stop choking me.”\nA few days later, the same staff member called another child the n-word and “a f-g-ot”\n49\nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 1   Filed 12/06/22   Page 49 of 73\n\nand told the child “[t]he only reason you are here is because your parents don’t love you.”\nStaff members have reportedly called the children in their care “dogs” and referred to\ntheir rooms as “dog kennels.” In one incident, a staff member “came to work in a bad\nmood” and told everybody“not to provoke him”; after one of the residents irritated the\nstaff member, the staff member was seen going into the child’s room, after which others\nheard loud banging noises, the child screaming in pain, yelling and cursing back and\nforth, the child warning the staff member they would bite, and the staff member\nscreaming. Other staff members ran into the room to physically pull the staff member off\nthe resident and pled with the staff member to remember that the resident was “onlya\nlittle kid.” As of the filing of this complaint, DHHS continues to send children in foster\ncare to Hope Gardens Treatment Center.\n194. NOVA Behavioral Healthcare in Kinston, which advertises that its\n“compliment of Residential Managers and Residential Supervisors provide basic and\nclinical oversight and ensure a safe and homelike living environment,” previously was\ncited for failing to ensure that at least two direct-care staff were present for every six\nchildren, in violation of state staffing regulations designed to protect youth. In 2021, a\nfemale client at Nova’s Maplewood unit tied an electrical cord around her neck, yet the\nfacility determined this incident did not result in a threat to her health or safety and did\nnot report it as required. Similarly, a 17-year-old girl in the Oakwood unit with a\ndocumented history of self-harm, suicidal ideation, and suicide attempts “was found\nsitting on the floor of the bathroom with shoestrings tied around her neck and to the\ncrossbar of the stall doors.” There were neither goals nor strategies in the child’s\n50\nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 1   Filed 12/06/22   Page 50 of 73\n\ntreatment plan to address her suicidal behaviors and ideation, nor sufficient supervision to\nprevent her from harming herself. Finally, when a child in the Oakwood unit threw milk,\na staff member threw it back at her and gave the child’s food to other children as\npunishment. The child became upset, and the staff member reacted by restraining the\nchild. The staff pulled the child’s head down by her braids and shoved her face into a\npillow, even though this type of life-threatening prone restraint was forbidden by DHHS\nover ten years ago. The staff member then initiated a restraint known as “the wrap,” but\nrestrained the child by the knees – rather than by the ankles as required by policy – and\nhurt the child bydigging her fingernails into the child’s skin.The staff member was told\nto “leave the situation alone” and “to tap out” but refused to disengage. As of the filing of\nthis complaint, DHHS continues to send children in foster care to NOVA Behavioral\nHealthcare.\n195. At Anderson Health Services in Marshville, staff implemented a\npsychologically-abusive punishment resembling solitary confinement called “Loss of\nPrivileges” (LOP). A child on LOP was confined to their bedroom for as long as 30 days,\nwith only15-to-30-minute walks outside. There were no policies or procedures for the\nuse of LOP, and staff were implementing the punishment with virtually no clinical\noversight. A volunteer with little-to-no clinical qualifications was “second in charge of\nthe facilityand responsible for multiple administrative positions including but not limited\nto corporate compliance, intake documentation and supervision.” A nurse practitioner and\ntwo registered nurses responsible for all medications at the facilityfailed to ensure\ndiscontinued medications were stored or properly disposed of. A nurse admitted to failing\n51\nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 1   Filed 12/06/22   Page 51 of 73\n\nto lock the door to the medication room “because it was a pain in the ‘a*s’” to do so. As a\nresult, 29 pills of Vyvanse (an amphetamine) went missing, and the facility could not\ndetermine if staff or children had removed the Vyvanse from the medication room. In\nanother instance, a registered nurse administered Zoloft (a selective serotonin reuptake\ninhibitor used to treat mental health disorders) and Metformin (an anti-diabetic\nmedication) to the wrong client, who then had to be monitored for hypoglycemic\nepisodes. A child reported that a therapist at the facility sexually touched him during a\nprivate therapy session; the therapist was suspended, but it is not clear whether any\nfurther action was taken. DHHS suspended Anderson’s license on June 1, 2018, but\npermitted the facilityto reopen in 2021 under new management. As of the filing of this\ncomplaint, DHHS continues to send children in foster care to Anderson Health Services.\n196. The PRTFs used by DHHS to house children with disabilities in foster care\nare not therapeutic environments. All children in foster care suffer the trauma of being\nremoved from their family homes, in addition to anytrauma relating to the circumstances\nof their removal. Unsurprisingly, children in foster care frequently have complex trauma\nhistories, including traumas experienced after removal while in foster care. Children in\nfoster care are likely to experience more trauma, not less at a PRTF, yet DHHS continues\nto place children with disabilities in these facilities.\n197. In commenting on the inappropriate overuse of traumatizing psychiatric\nfacilities for children in North Carolina, a state representative recently explained that “we\nare ruining people’s lives, and we’re doing it in the most expensive way possible. . . . It’s\ninhumane and irresponsible. It is a government failure.”\n52\nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 1   Filed 12/06/22   Page 52 of 73\n\nB. Black and Brown Children Bear the Brunt of DHHS’s Service System Design,\nFunding Choices, and Service Implementation Failures That Promote or Rely\non the Unnecessary Segregation of Children with Disabilities in Foster Care\nin PRTFs\n198. Children of color, such as Named Plaintiffs Flora P. and Steph C., are\ndisproportionately affected bythe harms associated with DHHS’s overreliance on\nPRTFs.\n199. Black and Brown children are disproportionately represented in the\nnumbers of children in foster care in North Carolina, and are again disproportionately\nrepresented in the numbers of children in foster care placed in a PRTF by DHHS.\n200. The disproportionality rate of children in foster care refers to the number of\nyouth in care compared to the number of youth in the general population. Based on 2019\ndata from Child Trends, the disproportionality rate in North Carolina for Black/African\nAmerican children in foster care in 2019 was 1.34, and the rate for multiracial children\nwas 1.5.\n201. In Mecklenburg County, one of the largest counties in North Carolina,\nchildren of color and Hispanic/Latinx children make up 63% of the population but\naccount for 88% of abuse or neglect reports made to Youth and Family Services (YFS).\nMecklenburg County YFS has admittedly “not relieved or exacerbated this disparity,\nwhich highlights the powerful downstream effects that disparate initial child welfare\ncontact” can have. This “downstream effect” includes Black and Brown children in foster\ncare bearing an undue and disparate harm from their unnecessary placement in PRTFs.\n53\nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 1   Filed 12/06/22   Page 53 of 73\n\n202. Public news articles in late 2021 reported that while Black children in\nNorth Carolina make up about 13% of children (not specific to the foster care\npopulation), they make up about 30% of Medicaid recipients within PRTFs.\n203. One article noted that PRTFs may be inappropriatelyused as a placement\nfor Black children with milder, misunderstood, or misinterpreted symptoms.\n204. The disproportionate use of foster care and unnecessaryPRTFs byDHHS\nimposes unjust and grave harm on Black children with disabilities in foster care.\nC. DHHS’s Known Methods of Funding and Administering Its Programs Result\nin Unlawful and Unnecessary Segregation of Children with Disabilities in\nFoster Care in PRTFs\n205. Defendant has a pattern, custom, policy, and/or practice of funding and\nadministering its programs in a manner and through methods that result in the\nunnecessary segregation of children with disabilities in foster care by failing to plan for,\ndevelop, operate, and fund a sufficient array of community-based placements and\nsupportive mental and behavioral health services for children with disabilities in foster\ncare and their caregivers that would allow them to live in integrated settings.\n206. These criteria or methods of administration include: grossly disparate\nfunding of PRTFs rather than community-based placements and supportive mental and\nbehavioral health services; failing to expand community-based foster care placements,\nincluding kinship and “fictive” kinship placements and therapeutic foster care; and failing\nto expand access to and maintaining waitlists and/or shortages of community-based\nintensive in-home services, community-based wrap-around services, community-based\n54\nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 1   Filed 12/06/22   Page 54 of 73\n\ncrisis intervention services, and community-based outpatient mental and behavioral\nhealth services.\n207. The purpose and philosophy behind North Carolina’s child welfare services\nis to provide family-centered services and serve children in their homes and communities.\n208. Yet DHHS has a policy, pattern, custom, and/or practice of unnecessarily\nplacing children in foster care with disabilities at PRTFs, which bydefinition provide\nnon-acute and time-limited care, and forcing those children to remain in these facilities\nlong-term when they can and should be served in the community.\n209. This policy, pattern, custom, and/or practice persists because DHHS has\nfailed to make adequate community-based placements and services available.\n210. According to 2020 state data, less than 1% of North Carolina children are in\nfoster care, but foster youth account for almost half of the children residing in PRTFs,\nplaced there byDHHS.\n211. DHHS’s “Division of Social Services (DSS) staff shared that children\ninvolved with the Child Welfare system sometimes remain in a PRTF long after a\ndischarge plan is made because there is no identified placement available for them.”\n212. Children in child welfare custody are admitted to PRTFs despite being\nappropriate for lower levels of care, remain in the facility longer than children who are\nnot in child welfare custody, often are laterally “discharged” to another PRTF, and\nexperience more frequent readmissions to PRTFs.\n213. DHHS also maintains a pattern, policy, custom, and/or practice of\nauthorizing significant numbers of children to be sent to out-of-state PRTFs, which\n55\nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 1   Filed 12/06/22   Page 55 of 73\n\nisolates children who could be served and accommodated in their communities even\nfurther from their home communities, families, and peers.\n214. Not onlydo DHHS’s practices violate the rights of children to live and be\nserved in the community, they also waste taxpayer’s money. DHHS spends at least\nhundreds of dollars per dayper child in a PRTF,and it pays more than $100 million\nannuallyto institutionalize children in PRTFs.\n215. DHHS could, but has failed to, expand community-based placements and\nsupportive mental and behavioral health services for children with disabilities in child\nwelfare custody.\n216. DHHS admits that North Carolina has a “limited arrayof available\ncommunity-based services across the state to support children remaining in family\nsettings or the least restrictive setting possible.” It acknowledges that this shortage is\ncausing its recent “[c]hallenges meeting the needs of children/youth in foster care with\ncomplex . . . behavioral health . . . or [intellectual/developmental disability] needs,\nresulting in restrictive residential or out-of-state placements.”\n217. Although the rate of children in foster care has increased from around\n10,000 youth in 2017 to over 11,000 youth in 2021, DHHS has not expanded the number\nof community-based placements available for these youth. Instead, the number of\nfamilies and children receiving in-home services has steadily declined. Moreover, the\nnumber of licensed foster families is dwindling, dropping from 7,100 to 6,500 as of June\n2022. For example, in Cumberland County, licensed foster homes decreased from 111 in\n56\nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 1   Filed 12/06/22   Page 56 of 73\n\n2018 to only54 in 2021. The lack of foster family homes is a significant driver of\nchildren’s being unnecessarilyplaced in PRTFs.\n218. DHHS needs to expand community-based foster care placements, including\nkinship and “fictive” kinship placements. According to DHHS’s federal reporting, “data\non the use of congregate care suggest North Carolina lacks an adequate supply of family\nfoster homes in at least some counties and regions.” A recent surveyfound that the most\ncommon reason for placement in congregate care “was the lack of an available family\nfoster home.”\n219. It was reported that from 2019 to 2020, less than a third of children\ndischarged from a PRTF transitioned to a community-based program, and some were\nlaterally discharged to another PRTF.\n220. As DHHS describes it, its child welfare services are an insufficient and\ndisparate patchwork of services for the traumatized children that DHHS must protect and\nprovide treatment for.\n221. According to one DHHS official in September 2022, North Carolina’s child\nwelfare system “is in crisis.” The same DHHS official publiclyadmitted that the state\ncould be sued at any time because of its systemic lack of appropriate placements for\nchildren in foster care.\n222. On any given day, the state averages about 50 children with emotional and\nbehavioral health needs “who have been discharged [from emergency rooms], but their\nappropriate level of placement has not been located.” According to recent state data, due\nto the lack of appropriate placements and services, at least “dozens” of children in foster\n57\nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 1   Filed 12/06/22   Page 57 of 73\n\ncare end up “sleeping in hospital emergency rooms, in countydepartments of social\nservices offices or local hotel rooms” each week. Moreover, the lack of community-based\nservices puts children with disabilities in foster care at risk for placement in PRTFs.\nD. Community-Based Services and Placements Should Be Used When\nAppropriate for Children with Disabilities in Foster Care, but DHHS Fails to\nPrioritize Integrated Services\n223. Living in inappropriate settings further traumatizes children in foster care.\nAccording to DHHS’s own 2022 report, “[t]he longer children are separated from their\nfamilies, the less likely theyare to be reunified with them, and they run a higher risk of\nexperiencing poor health and social outcomes, including homelessness and involvement\nwith the justice system.\n224. The current institutional reality of day-to-day child welfare practices stands\nin stark contrast to DHHS’s policy that “[i]nstitutional placement should be a rare\nexception and there must be clear and convincing habilitative, physical, and/or clinical\nreasons to support the placement.”\n225. The lack of community-based mental and behavioral health services,\ncoupled with frequent placement disruptions resulting from a lack of these services,\nplaces children with disabilities in foster care at serious risk for placement, and/or\nextended stays, in PRTFs, and for lengthy and repeat stays in PRTFs.\n226. The federal government published a report showing that children placed in,\nor at serious risk for placement in, PRTFs can be served more effectivelyand at a much\nlower cost in the community.\n58\nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 1   Filed 12/06/22   Page 58 of 73\n\n227. DHHS knows that evidence-based wraparound services in the community\nare effective and help children such as Timothy B., Flora P., Isabella A., and Steph C.\nDHHS states that “[t]his intensive program has been shown to keep more children in their\nhomes, preventing the need for facility-based or residential care.” It also would save the\nstate an estimated $33,000 per child served via high-fidelity wraparound services instead\nof via a PRTF placement.\n228. National data also support the provision of evidenced-based wraparound\nand other community-based services, showing that children do not have better outcomes\nin PRTFs and “do not appear to gain greater benefit from [congregate] treatment relative\nto peers with similar risk profiles but treated in familysettings.”\n229. According to state data, while North Carolina Medicaid offers high-fidelity\nwraparound services – an evidence-based care management program for children with\nmental health challenges that has been shown to keep children in their homes and prevent\nthe need for facility-based or residential care – these services are offered in only 33 out of\nthe 100 counties in North Carolina, and DHHS admits more funding is needed to expand\nthese services across the entire state.\n230. According to a 2021 DHHS study, one roadblock to community-based\nservices for children with disabilities in foster care is a shortage of sufficient qualified\nservice providers. “Too many community-based service providers do not have the skills\nnecessaryor incentives to serve individuals with complex needs or challenging behaviors,\nleaving state-operated facilities and costly, out-of-state psychiatric residential treatment\nfacilities (PRTFs) as the only options for services for these individuals.”\n59\nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 1   Filed 12/06/22   Page 59 of 73\n\n231. It would not effect a fundamental alteration to North Carolina’s child\nwelfare system if DHHS and its agents were ordered to make arrangements to expand\ncommunity-based services and placements for children with mental impairments in child\nwelfare custody.\n232. DHHS recently stated in 2022 that it “can build upon existing effective and\ninnovative supports scattered across our state with targeted, ongoing investments to\nprovide coordinated, consistent services that deliver better outcomes for children,\nfamilies, and the state.”\n233. In the same report, DHHS described its child welfare and behavioral health\nservices as a patchwork of uneven support across the state. DHHS admits that children\nwith complex behavioral health needs in the care of child welfare services require\nDHHS’s “immediate attention through better coordination and increased resources for\nservices that close gaps in care.”\n234. DHHS has also acknowledged its problem with waitlists for services.\nDefendant Kinsley recently noted that a “core factor that drives a lot of these waitlists . . .\nis our vacancy rate” for employees. The Department’s employee vacancy rate has\ndoubled since the COVID-19 pandemic, reaching over 23% as of July 2022. That\nincludes a 42% rate, or 46 vacancies, for psychologists, and a 44% rate, or 68 vacancies,\nfor clinical social workers. According to Defendant Kinsley, the “situation means\nincreased waitlists, increased time on waitlists, increased need for services, and fewer\npeople served.”\n60\nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 1   Filed 12/06/22   Page 60 of 73\n\n235. Through its Medicaid program, in which all Named Plaintiffs and putative\nclass members are enrolled, DHHS faciallyoffers community-based services and\nplacements to children with disabilities in foster care, but it has not made these services\navailable to all youth who need them. As a result, children with disabilities in foster care\nare forced into PRTFs, in violation of their rights under the ADA and Rehabilitation Act.\n236. For example, according to state data, although North Carolina Medicaid\noffers care management services, which consist of a facilitator-led team and supports for\nthe family and child to help reach agreed-upon goals, less than 50% of children in North\nCarolina’s foster care system access these services.\n237. Data collected during a focus group to review in-home mental and\nbehavioral health services as part of DHHS’s 2022 reporting to the federal\nAdministration on Children identified numerous systemic issues barring access to\nservices. These barriers include a limited number of available services, poor quality\nservices, poor accessibilityof services, need for more flexible services, transportation\nbarriers, lack of funding for programs, and waitlists.\n238. DHHS’s 2022 federal reporting also stated “that there are significant\nsystemic barriers to families’ accessing services. The most commonly cited barriers were\nlimited services or no available services, transportation to services, and youth having a\ndual diagnosis of mental health and substance use issues.”\n239. Mobile crisis services provide in-person and virtual support within an hour\nof being called when a child is in crisis and connect a child with necessary clinical and\nsocial services. North Carolina recognized and admitted in 2022 that expansion of such\n61\nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 1   Filed 12/06/22   Page 61 of 73\n\nservices would keep children out of restrictive residential settings and connect them more\nrapidlyto community-based services. However, according to state data, North Carolina’s\n“MORES” in-person and virtual Crisis Intervention Teams for youth experiencing mental\nhealth crises is offered in onlya fraction of counties in the state.\n240. All of the above methods of DHHS’s administration of its programs,\nindividually and collectively, cause in significant part the unnecessary institutionalization\nand segregation of children with disabilities in foster care in PRTFs.\nCAUSES OF ACTION\nFIRST CAUSE OF ACTION:\nDISCRIMINATION IN VIOLATION OF THE AMERICANS WITH\nDISABILITIES ACT (“ADA”), 42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq.\n(Asserted on behalf of Plaintiffs DRNC and NC NAACP, the Named Plaintiffs, and\nthe putative class against Defendant Kinsley in his official capacity)\n241. Plaintiffs incorporate by reference each and every allegation contained in\nthe foregoing paragraphs as if specifically alleged herein.\n242. Title II of the ADA requires, inter alia, that “no qualified individual with a\ndisability shall, by reason of such disability, be excluded from participation in or be\ndenied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities of a public entity, or be\nsubjected to discrimination byany such entity.” See 42 U.S.C. § 12132.\n243. DHHS is a “public entity” as used in Title II of the ADA. See 42 U.S.C.\n§ 12131(1)(B). Defendant, acting in his official capacity, is a public entity as defined by\nthe ADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12131, and its implementing regulations, 28 C.F.R. § 35.104. As\nsuch, the ADA prohibits Defendant from discriminating against individuals with\n62\nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 1   Filed 12/06/22   Page 62 of 73\n\ndisabilities in its programs and services. See 42 U.S.C. § 12132. Further, Defendant’s\nunnecessary segregation of individuals with disabilities constitutes unlawful\ndiscrimination under Title II of the ADA. Olmstead v. L.C. ex rel. Zimring, 527 U.S. 581,\n600 (1999).\n244. The Named Plaintiffs and the putative class are qualified individuals with\ndisabilities entitled to the protections of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12131, and its\nimplementing regulations, 28 C.F.R. § 35.104.\n245. Child welfare services, including foster care, the North Carolina Medicaid\nprogram, state-funded disability services, and oversight of PRTFs, are services,\nprograms, or activities of Defendant, a public entity.\n246. The Named Plaintiffs and the putative class are otherwise qualified\nindividuals with disabilities for purposes of these services, programs, or activities of\nDefendant.\n247. Title II contains an “integration mandate” requiring public entities to\n“administer services, programs, and activities in the most integrated setting appropriate to\nthe needs of qualified individuals with disabilities.” 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(d).\n248. DHHS and its agents institutionalized the Named Plaintiffs and the putative\nclass in PRTFs, or have acted or failed to act in a manner that puts the Named Plaintiffs\nand the putative class at serious risk for institutionalization in a PRTF, a wholly\nsegregated setting, in violation of the integration mandate.\n249. Title II further provides that public entities may not “[a]fford a qualified\nindividual with a disability an opportunity to participate in or benefit from the aid,\n63\nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 1   Filed 12/06/22   Page 63 of 73\n\nbenefit, or service that is” either “not equal to that afforded others” or “not as effective in\naffording equal opportunity” to gain the same result or benefit as provided to others. See\n28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(1)(ii)-(iii).\n250. Title II of the ADA requires public entities to make reasonable\nmodifications to their child welfare programs to avoid discrimination on the basis of\ndisability. See 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(7).\n251. As children in child welfare custody, the Named Plaintiffs and the putative\nclass are categorically eligible for Medicaid and are presumed eligible, based on\ndisability, for DHHS’s publicly-funded mental health services, and such community-\nbased services already exist. Defendant has not made reasonable modifications, to the\nextent anyare necessary, to provide the Named Plaintiffs and the putative class access to\nthese community-based child welfare services and integrated placements.\n252. Public entities cannot use criteria or methods of administration that\ndiscriminate on the basis of disability. See 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b).\n253. Defendant has a policy and practice of discriminating against the Named\nPlaintiffs and the putative class based on disability byrelying on criteria or methods of\nadministration in its child welfare services that prioritize or permit placement of the\nNamed Plaintiffs and the putative class in institutions based on their disability and need\nfor services, even though home and community-based placements and services are\navailable and are being provided to other children with the same diagnoses. These criteria\nor methods of administration include: grossly disparate funding of PRTFs rather than\ncommunity-based placements and supportive mental and behavioral health services;\n64\nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 1   Filed 12/06/22   Page 64 of 73\n\nfailing to expand community-based foster care placements, including kinship and\n“fictive” kinship placements and therapeutic foster care; and failing to expand access to,\nmaintaining waitlists for, and/or permitting shortages of community-based intensive in-\nhome services, community-based wrap-around services, community-based crisis\nintervention services, and community-based outpatient mental and behavioral health\nservices.\n254. Defendant has a policy and practice of planning, administering, and funding\nits child welfare system in a manner that unnecessarilysegregates children with\ndisabilities in PRTFs. As a result, children with disabilities in the custodyof child welfare\nagencies are needlessly segregated or at serious risk of unnecessary segregation.\n255. The Named Plaintiffs and the putative class do not oppose community-\nbased treatment and placement.\n256. An integrated setting is appropriate for the Named Plaintiffs and the\nputative class. Other children with the same diagnoses and/or similar needs are receiving\nservices in integrated settings and live in community-based integrated placements.\n257. As a result of Defendant’s actions and inactions, the Named Plaintiffs and\nthe putative class have suffered and will continue to suffer irreparable harm: they have\nsuffered and will continue to suffer from discrimination, unnecessary institutionalization,\nand inability to access community-based mental health services and other supports while\nin the custody of child welfare agents, deprivation of adults with whom theycan form\nhealthy attachments, the known harms of exposure to congregate care placement, and\ninjury to their prospects for lifelong success and prosperity.\n65\nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 1   Filed 12/06/22   Page 65 of 73\n\n258. In the absence of declaratoryand injunctive relief, Defendant will continue\nto institutionalize and deny Plaintiffs their right to live in the most integrated setting\nappropriate to their needs.\nSECOND CAUSE OF ACTION:\nDISCRIMINATION IN VIOLATION OF SECTION 504 OF THE\nREHABILITATION ACT, 29 U.S.C. § 794\n(Asserted on behalf of Plaintiffs DRNC and NC NAACP, the Named Plaintiffs, and\nthe putative class against Defendant Kinsley in his official capacity)\n259. Plaintiffs incorporate by reference all allegations contained in the preceding\nparagraphs, as if alleged herein.\n260. Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act mandates that “[n]o otherwise\nqualified individual with a disability . . . shall, solely by reason of her or his disability, be\nexcluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to\ndiscrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.” 29\nU.S.C. § 794(a).\n261. The Named Plaintiffs and the putative class are otherwise qualified\nindividuals with disabilities entitled to the protections of the Rehabilitation Act. See 29\nU.S.C. § 705(20)(B) (citing to the ADA’s definition at 42 U.S.C. § 12102).\n262. The Rehabilitation Act defines a “program or activity,” in pertinent part, as\n“all of the operations of a department [or] agency . . . of a State or of a local\ngovernment.” 29 U.S.C. § 794(b)(1).\n263. DHHS is a governmental agency that receives “federal financial assistance”\nas used in the Rehabilitation Act and operates programs or activities within the meaning\n66\nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 1   Filed 12/06/22   Page 66 of 73\n\nof Section 504. See 29 U.S.C. § 794(b)(1)(A). Defendant, acting in his official capacity,\nadministers programs or activities as defined by the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. §\n794(b), and its implementing regulations, 28 C.F.R. § 41.51.\n264. Child welfare services, including foster care, the North Carolina Medicaid\nprogram, state-funded disability services, and oversight of PRTFs, are programs or\nactivities of Defendant.\n265. The Rehabilitation Act contains an “integration mandate” requiring covered\nentities to provide aids, benefits, and services that afford people with disabilities “equal\nopportunityto obtain the same result, to gain the same benefit, or to reach the same level\nof achievement, in the most integrated setting appropriate to the person’s needs.” 45\nC.F.R. § 84.4(b)(2).\n266. DHHS’s agents have placed the Named Plaintiffs and the putative class in\nPRTFs and/or have acted or failed to act in a manner that puts the Named Plaintiffs and\nthe putative class at serious risk for placement in a PRTF, a whollysegregated placement\nthat is not as effective as community-based behavioral and mental health treatment,\ndenies children adequate social-emotional caregiver-child interactions, and is likelyto\nlead to less positive outcomes for the Named Plaintiffs and the putative class than would\nprovision of community-based treatment and placement in a community-based setting.\n267. DHHS’s agents have institutionalized the Named Plaintiffs and the putative\nclass, and/or placed them at serious risk of institutionalization, in a PRTF, a wholly\nsegregated setting that violates the integration mandate.\n67\nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 1   Filed 12/06/22   Page 67 of 73\n\n268. The Rehabilitation Act forbids covered entities from using criteria or\nmethods of administration that discriminate on the basis of disability or defeat or\nsubstantially impair accomplishment of the objectives of the recipient’s program or\nactivity. 45 C.F.R. § 84.4(b)(4).\n269. Defendant discriminates against the Named Plaintiffs and the putative class\nbased on disability by relying on criteria or methods of administration that prioritize or\npermit institutional placement of the Named Plaintiffs and the putative class in PRTFs,\ndespite their eligibility for an array of home and community-based placements and\nservices. These criteria or methods of administration include: grossly disparate funding of\nPRTFs relative to community-based placements and mental and behavioral health\nservices; failing to expand community-based foster care placements, including kinship\nand “fictive” kinship placements and therapeutic foster care; failing to expand access to,\nand maintaining waitlists and/or shortages of, community-based intensive in-home\nservices, community-based wrap-around services, community-based crisis intervention\nservices, and community-based outpatient mental and behavioral health services.\n270. DHHS plans, administers, and funds its child welfare system in a manner\nthat unnecessarily segregates children with disabilities in PRTFs.\n271. Defendant defeats or substantially impairs its objective of improving, not\nhindering, outcomes for children with disabilities in its custody bypermitting the Named\nPlaintiffs’ and the putative class’s continued placement in wholly segregated settings that\nare less effective and less likely to lead to positive outcomes for the Named Plaintiffs and\nthe putative class.\n68\nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 1   Filed 12/06/22   Page 68 of 73\n\n272. The Named Plaintiffs and the putative class do not oppose community-\nbased treatment.\n273. An integrated setting is appropriate for the Named Plaintiffs and the\nputative class; other children with similar diagnoses and/or similar needs are receiving\nservices in integrated settings and live in community-based integrated placements.\n274. As a result of Defendant’s actions and inactions, the Named Plaintiffs and\nthe putative class have suffered and will continue to suffer irreparable harm: they have\nsuffered and will continue to suffer from discrimination and unequal access to\nDefendant’s child welfare services, deprivation of adults with whom they can form\nattachments, the known harms of exposure to congregate care placement, and injuryto\ntheir prospects for lifelong success and prosperity.\n275. In the absence of declarative and injunctive relief, Defendant will continue\nto unnecessarily institutionalize and deny the Named Plaintiffs and the putative class their\nright to live in the most integrated settings appropriate to their needs and which provide\nthem equal opportunity to reach the same level of achievement as children with mental\nimpairments who are placed in the community and receive community-based behavioral\nand mental health treatment.\n69\nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 1   Filed 12/06/22   Page 69 of 73\n\nPRAYER FOR RELIEF\nTHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfullyrequest that the Court exercise its legal and\nequitable powers and award class-wide relief as follows:\nA. Assert subject matter jurisdiction over the action.\nB. Certify the putative class pursuant to FED.R.CIV.P. 23(a) and (b)(2).\nC. Declare unlawful pursuant to FED.R.CIV.P. 57: policies, procedures, and\npractices that violate Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. §\n12131 et seq., or Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794 et seq.,\nand their implementing regulations such as:\na. Defendant’s failure to place and provide the Named Plaintiffs and the\nputative class with services in the most integrated settings appropriate to\nmeet their needs;\nb. Defendant’s use of criteria and methods of administration in its child\nwelfare services that deny the Named Plaintiffs and the putative class the\nopportunityto live and receive services in the most integrated settings\nappropriate to meet their needs; and\nc. Defendant’s failure to plan, administer, and fund its mental and behavioral\nhealth system and child welfare system in a manner that does not\nunnecessarily segregate children with mental impairments in PRTFs.\nD. Award prospective permanent injunctive relief and order appropriate tailored\nremedies, including but not limited to requiring Defendant to:\n70\nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 1   Filed 12/06/22   Page 70 of 73\n\na. Administer its programs such that it has available a sufficient supply of\nintegrated, community-based placements and services to meet the needs of\nchildren with mental impairments in foster care;\nb. Implement and sustain an effective system for transitioning children with\nmental impairments in foster care out of PRTFs into integrated,\ncommunity-based placements and services; and\nc. Make reasonable accommodations or modifications, as necessary, to meet\nthe needs of North Carolina’s children with mental impairments in foster\ncare in integrated, community-based placements and services.\nE. Modify or develop and implement policies and practices as necessary to cease its\nviolations of the statutory rights of children with disabilities in foster care placed\nor at serious risk of placement in PRTFs.\nF. Appoint a neutral expert under FED.R.CIV.P. 65(d) to monitor the provisions of\nthe Court’s order.\nG. Award to Plaintiffs’ counsel the reasonable costs and expenses including\nreasonable attorneys’ fees pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1920, 42 U.S.C. § 12205, 29\nU.S.C. § 794a, and FED.R.CIV.P. 23(e) and 23(h).\nH. Grant such other further and equitable relief as the Court deems just, necessary,\nand proper to protect Plaintiffs from further harm while in Defendant’s custody\nand care.\n71\nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 1   Filed 12/06/22   Page 71 of 73\n\nDATED: DECEMBER 6, 2022\nDISABILITYRIGHTSNORTHCAROLINA\n/s/ Holly Stiles\nHolly Stiles\nN.C.

Case No. 1:22-cv-1046 \n \nKody Kinsley, \n \nDefendant. \n \n \nSTATEMENT OF INTEREST OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA \n  The United States of America respectfully submits this Statement of Interest under \n28 U.S.C. § 517 to provide its views regarding the legal standard for stating a claim under \nTitle II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (the “ADA”), 42 U.S.C. §§ 12131–12134, \nand Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (“Section 504”), 29 U.S.C. § 794.1  Title II of \nthe ADA and Section 504 both require public entities to administer their services, \nprograms, and activities to people with disabilities in the most integrated setting \nappropriate to their needs.  This requirement is known as the “integration mandate.”2 \n                                                 \n \n1 The Attorney General is authorized “to attend to the interests of the United States” in \nany case pending in federal court.  28 U.S.C. § 517. \n2 See 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(d); 28 C.F.R. § 41.51(d).  The integration mandates of both \nstatutes are analyzed together because they “impose the same integration requirements.”  \nPashby v. Delia, 709 F.3d 307, 321 (4th Cir. 2013); see also 42 U.S.C. § 12134(b); 28 \nC.F.R. § 35.103.  Although this Statement of Interest focuses on interpretation of the \nADA, the analysis here applies equally to integration mandate claims under Section 504.  \n1 \n \nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 57   Filed 04/21/23   Page 1 of 25\n\nThe amended complaint in this case alleges that children with disabilities who are \nin the custody of North Carolina’s child welfare system are routinely and unnecessarily \nsegregated, or placed at serious risk of segregation, in psychiatric residential treatment \nfacilities (“PRTFs”), in violation of the integration mandate.  The plaintiffs in this case \nare children with disabilities in child welfare custody (“Named Plaintiffs”) and two \nadvocacy organizations (“Associational Plaintiffs”) (collectively, the “Plaintiffs”).  \nPlaintiffs bring this action on behalf of a putative class of all children with disabilities in \nchild welfare custody.  The amended complaint alleges that children in foster care enter \nPRTFs when they could be served in the community, and languish in PRTFs for extended \nperiods of time because community-based placements and services are unavailable.  The \namended complaint further alleges that these children could live in their communities in \nfamily-based placements with appropriate services, including mental and behavioral \nhealth services.  \nDefendant, Secretary of the North Carolina Department of Health and Human \nServices (“DHHS”), moved to dismiss the amended complaint on several grounds.  \nDefendant argues that Plaintiffs’ integration mandate claims should be dismissed because \nNamed Plaintiffs have not alleged that the State’s treatment professionals determined that \ncommunity-based placements would be appropriate to their needs, and because Named \nPlaintiffs’ parents, guardians, and/or custodians consented to their placement in PRTFs.  \nDefendant also argues that Plaintiffs are collaterally estopped from bringing claims that \nfoster children have been unnecessarily segregated in PRTFs in violation of the \n2 \n \nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 57   Filed 04/21/23   Page 2 of 25\n\nintegration mandate, because the children’s placement in PRTFs has already been fully \nlitigated in state court proceedings.  Defendant further argues that the Named Plaintiffs \nlack standing because they cannot show that DHHS caused their alleged injuries or that \nthe relief they seek would redress their injuries. \nIn this Statement of Interest, the United States highlights four principles of law \nrelating to integration mandate claims.  First, plaintiffs do not need to allege that state \ntreatment professionals found that integrated settings are appropriate to their needs.  \nOpinions from state treatment professionals are one way—but not the only way—for \nplaintiffs to demonstrate appropriateness.  Here, Named Plaintiffs allege that they are \neligible for the very services North Carolina already offers in the community, that they \nhave previously been authorized to receive such services, and that they are just like other \nchildren with disabilities who are successfully receiving care in the community through \nthe State’s programs and services.  These allegations are sufficient to state a claim that \nNamed Plaintiffs are appropriate for community-based services. \nSecond, children in state custody need not allege that their custodian affirmatively \nchose community-based care to state an integration mandate claim.  A state cannot \nabdicate its responsibility to provide community-based services to children in its custody \nsimply by asserting that the state itself chose institutional placement for those children.  \nHere, Named Plaintiffs—through their guardians ad litem—do affirmatively allege that \nthey are seeking community-based care, which is enough to state a claim.   \n3 \n \nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 57   Filed 04/21/23   Page 3 of 25\n\n Third, state court proceedings to determine if a child needs treatment in a PRTF—\nthat consider different evidence and apply a different legal standard—do not estop claims \nof unnecessary segregation under the integration mandate.  And fourth, plaintiffs have \nstanding to bring claims against a public entity that designs, operates, and funds service \nsystems for people with disabilities to ensure that those systems comply with the \nintegration mandate.  Here, Named Plaintiffs allege a causal connection between DHHS’s \nfailures with respect to its community-based services system and their unnecessary \nsegregation.  Accordingly, an injunction requiring DHHS to modify its service system—\nso that community-based services are actually available to children who need them—\nwould likely redress Plaintiffs’ injuries. \nINTEREST OF THE UNITED STATES \n  This litigation implicates the proper interpretation and application of Title II of the \nADA.  The United States Department of Justice implements and enforces Title II of the \nADA.3  42 U.S.C. §§ 12133–12134; 28 C.F.R. Part 35 (delegating authority to the \nDepartment of Justice to promulgate regulations under Title II).  The Department of \nJustice therefore has an interest in supporting proper and uniform application of the \nADA, and in furthering Congress’s intent to create “clear, strong, consistent, enforceable \nstandards addressing discrimination against individuals with disabilities” and reserve a \n                                                 \n \n3 The Department of Justice is also charged with enforcing Section 504, 29 U.S.C. \n§ 794(a), and with coordinating federal agencies’ implementation and enforcement of \nSection 504, 28 C.F.R. Part 41; Exec. Order No. 12,250, 45 Fed. Reg. 72,995 (Nov. 2, \n1980); see also 28 C.F.R. § 0.51(b)(3). \n4 \n \nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 57   Filed 04/21/23   Page 4 of 25\n\n“central role” for the federal government in enforcing the ADA’s standards.  Id. \n§§ 12101(b)(2)–(3).   \nPLAINTIFFS’ FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \n  Plaintiffs allege that DHHS is violating the integration mandate by failing to \nprovide children with disabilities in foster care with community-based services and \nthereby causing them to enter institutions to receive care.  Am. Compl. (D.E. 35) ¶¶ 25–\n140.  Plaintiffs seek to represent a putative class of all children with disabilities in child \nwelfare custody who are unnecessarily institutionalized in PRTFs or at serious risk of \nunnecessary institutionalization in PRTFs.  Am. Compl. ¶ 155.  All of the Named \nPlaintiffs state that they want to live in the community, instead of in PRTFs.  Am. Compl. \n¶¶ 58, 71, 88, 107, 125–26.  Many of these children have previously lived and received \nservices in the community.  Am. Compl. ¶¶ 65, 86, 106. \n  Plaintiffs allege that children in the putative class are eligible and appropriate for \nan array of community-based services, including state-funded disability services and \nservices offered through North Carolina’s child welfare system and statewide Medicaid \nprogram.  Am. Compl. ¶¶ 51–52, 68–69, 85–86, 103–104, 122–123, 174–76, 261–62, \n271–72, 277, 279, 282, 299.  All of these programs and services are overseen and \noperated by DHHS.  Am. Compl. ¶ 144.  Plaintiffs allege that North Carolina’s \ncommunity-based programs and services, if available, would allow children in the \nputative class to live in the community.  E.g. Am. Compl. ¶¶ 253, 255.  For example, \nDHHS offers an evidence-based program known as “wraparound” that coordinates \n5 \n \nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 57   Filed 04/21/23   Page 5 of 25\n\nintensive services for children in family homes.

Am. Compl. at 77.    \nLEGAL BACKGROUND \nCongress enacted the ADA “to provide a clear and comprehensive national \nmandate for the elimination of discrimination against individuals with disabilities.”  42 \nU.S.C. § 12101(b)(1).  Congress found that “society has tended to isolate and segregate \nindividuals with disabilities” and that “individuals with disabilities continually encounter \nvarious forms of discrimination, including . . . segregation.”  Id. §§ 12101(a)(2), (5).  To \naddress this longstanding history of segregation and isolation, the regulation \nimplementing Title II of the ADA includes an integration mandate that requires public \nentities, including states and their departments, to “administer services, programs, and \nactivities” to people with disabilities “in the most integrated setting appropriate to the[ir] \nneeds.”  28 C.F.R. § 35.130(d); see also 42 U.S.C. § 12131(1) (defining “public entity”).  \nThe “most integrated setting” is one that “enables individuals with disabilities to interact \nwith nondisabled persons to the fullest extent possible.”  28 C.F.R. pt. 35, app. B at 711.  \nPublic entities must reasonably modify their policies, practices, and procedures to avoid \n7 \n \nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 57   Filed 04/21/23   Page 7 of 25\n\ndiscriminating on the basis of disability, unless such modifications would fundamentally \nalter the nature of a service, program, or activity.  Id. § 35.130(b)(7)(i).     \nThe Supreme Court has recognized that unnecessary segregation is discrimination \non the basis of disability.  Olmstead v. L.C. ex rel. Zimring, 527 U.S. 581, 597 (1999).  \nUnder the integration mandate, a public entity must provide community-based services to \nindividuals with disabilities when (1) community-based services are appropriate to the \nindividuals’ needs; (2) the individuals do not oppose community-based services; and (3) \nthe public entity can reasonably accommodate community-based services, taking into \naccount its available resources and the needs of other individuals with disabilities.  Id. at \n607.  Public entities must comply with the integration mandate even if they license, \ncontract with, or otherwise arrange for other entities to administer their services.  28 \nC.F.R. § 35.130(b)(3)(i).  \nDISCUSSION \nA.  Plaintiffs do not need to allege that state treatment professionals found that \nintegrated settings are appropriate to their needs. \nDefendant argues that Named Plaintiffs fail to state a claim under the integration \nmandate because they do not allege that state treatment professionals determined that \ncommunity placement is appropriate for them.  Mot. to Dismiss (D.E. 41) at 9–12.  But \nfederal district courts have “universally rejected” the argument that an assessment from a \nstate treatment professional is required to state a claim under the integration mandate.  \n8 \n \nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 57   Filed 04/21/23   Page 8 of 25\n\nZ.S. v. Durham Cnty., No. 1:21-CV-663, 2022 WL 673649, at *4 (M.D.N.C. Mar. 7, \n2022) (quoting United States v. Georgia, 461 F. Supp. 3d 1315, 1323 (N.D. Ga. 2020)).4   \nFor example, in M.J. v. District of Columbia, the court held that plaintiffs need not \nallege that a state treatment professional found them appropriate for community-based \nservices.  401 F. Supp. 3d 1, 12–13 (D.D.C. 2019).  In that putative class action, the \nplaintiffs—who were children with mental health disabilities—alleged that the District \nviolated the integration mandate by failing to provide community-based services and \nroutinely admitting children to residential facilities even though the children were eligible \nfor community-based treatment.  Id. at 4–5.  The District moved to dismiss, arguing in \npart that the plaintiffs had not alleged that they were appropriate for community-based \nservices.  Id. at 12–13.  The court concluded that plaintiffs need not allege that a \ntreatment provider has explicitly stated that community-based treatment is appropriate.  \nRather, the court held that plaintiffs’ allegations that they would be able to live in their \nhomes and communities, if the District provided the required treatment, was enough to \ndemonstrate that community-based treatment was appropriate.  Id. at 13.   \nPlaintiffs here allege that there are community-based placements and services that \ncould meet the needs of Named Plaintiffs and the putative class.  Am.

Paterson, 653 F. Supp. \n2d 184, 245–46 (E.D.N.Y. 2009) (“DAI II”) (evidence that individuals with similar \ndisabilities were living and receiving services in integrated settings demonstrated \nappropriateness), vacated on other grounds sub nom.

Children in child welfare custody do not need to allege that their adult \ndecisionmakers affirmatively chose community-based services. \nDefendant argues that Plaintiffs’ integration mandate claims should be dismissed \nbecause Plaintiffs do not allege that children’s parents, guardians, or custodians \naffirmatively chose services in the community.  Mot. to Dismiss at 12.  In support of this \nargument, Defendant describes procedures that DHHS employs to obtain a parent or \nguardian’s consent to place a foster child in a PRTF, to the extent a parent or guardian \nretains some decisionmaking authority.  Mot. to Dismiss at 12–14.  Defendant also \n10 \n \nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 57   Filed 04/21/23   Page 10 of 25\n\ndescribes procedures that DHHS, through county DSS offices, uses to place foster \nchildren who are in its custody in PRTFs.  Mot. to Dismiss at 13–14.  Defendant argues \nthat because parents or guardians—or DHHS, the custodian—consented to children’s \nplacement in PRTFs, PRTFs are the “preferred setting” for these children to receive \nservices, Mot. to Dismiss at 13–14, and Plaintiffs thus cannot claim that these children \nwere unnecessarily segregated.  Defendant’s argument misses the mark.   \nTo start, the Named Plaintiffs—through their guardians ad litem in this action—do \naffirmatively allege that they want to live in the community in family homes, with \nappropriate services and supports.  Am. Compl. ¶¶ 57–58, 71, 88, 107, 125.  These \nallegations surpass the bar for stating a claim of unnecessary segregation, since the \nintegration mandate merely requires plaintiffs to allege that they do not oppose receiving \nservices in the community.  Olmstead, 527 U.S. at 607. \nTo the extent any parent or guardian consented to a foster child’s placement in a \nPRTF, that prior consent has no bearing on whether the parent or guardian opposes \ncommunity-based treatment under the integration mandate.  Whether a person consents to \ninstitutional treatment is an entirely different inquiry from whether the person would \naccept community-based services if those services were available.  See DAI II, 653 F. \nSupp. 2d. at 262–63.  Indeed, the Supreme Court in Olmstead held that the plaintiff was \nnot opposed to community-based services even though she chose to remain in a \npsychiatric hospital instead of discharging to a homeless shelter.  527 U.S. at 593, 603.  \nThe fact that children’s parents or guardians consented to their placement in PRTFs does \n11 \n \nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 57   Filed 04/21/23   Page 11 of 25\n\nnot prevent those children from stating a claim under the integration mandate. \nA decision by DHHS or its agents to place a foster child in a PRTF also does not \ndefeat an integration mandate claim. A state cannot abdicate its obligation to provide \nservices in integrated settings to children in its custody simply by asserting that it chose \ninstitutional placement for those children. As explained above, courts routinely hold that \nit would be “illogical to make plaintiffs suing a state rely on an opinion from that state’s \nprofessionals,” Georgia Advoc. Off., 447 F. Supp. 3d 1311 at 1323, and the same \nreasoning applies here.  Allowing a public entity to defeat an integration mandate claim \nby arguing that it selected institutionalization for children in its custody would render the \nintegration mandate meaningless for those children.  Cf. DAI II, 653 F. Supp. 2d at 259 \n(requiring a determination from state-contracted treatment professionals would \n“eviscerate the integration mandate”).  As a public entity, DHHS has an affirmative \nobligation to serve children with disabilities in the most integrated setting appropriate to \ntheir needs, and therefore cannot defeat Plaintiffs’ claims by arguing that DHHS, through \nDSS employees and treatment professionals, chose to place children in the putative class \nin PRTFs.  42 U.S.C. § 12132; 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(d). \nWhen a public entity has not made community-based services available to a \nperson with a disability, the person’s consent to enter or remain in an institution is not a \nchoice to “oppose” community services under the integration mandate.  Indeed, courts \nhave acknowledged that “the meaningful exercise of a preference will be possible only if \nan adequate array of community services are available.”  Kenneth R. ex rel. Tri-Cnty. \n12 \n \nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 57   Filed 04/21/23   Page 12 of 25\n\nCAP, Inc./GS v. Hassan, 293 F.R.D. 254, 270 (D.N.H. 2013) (emphasis in original).  As \njust one example, in Murphy by Murphy v. Minnesota Dep’t of Hum. Servs., the court \nheld that the plaintiffs plausibly alleged integration mandate claims where they alleged \nthat the defendant public entity failed to provide them with an informed choice of \ncommunity-based alternatives to institutionalization.  260 F. Supp. 3d 1084, 1117 (D. \nMinn. 2017).   \nHere, Plaintiffs state that they can and want to receive services in the community.  \nAm. Compl. ¶¶ 58, 71, 88, 107, 125–26.  But they allege that DHHS has provided them \nwith few, if any, alternatives to institutionalization.  Am. Compl. ¶¶ 10, 14, 17, 66.  Since \nDHHS has failed to provide sufficient community-based services, parents, guardians, and \ncustodians cannot make a meaningful choice of where they want a child to receive \nservices.  Allegations that DHHS has failed to provide Plaintiffs—or their parents, \nguardians, or custodians—with a meaningful choice of community-based options are \nenough to demonstrate non-opposition under the integration mandate.  See DAI II, 653 F. \nSupp. 2d. at 262–63 (finding that the fact that plaintiffs “entered [institutions] because \nthey had nowhere else to go” was evidence that they would not oppose community-based \nservices, if those services were available).  Accordingly, relying on “consent” to \ninstitutionalization to defeat an integration mandate claim would be improper. \n13 \n \nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 57   Filed 04/21/23   Page 13 of 25\n\nC.  State court proceedings that consider different evidence and apply a different \nlegal standard do not preclude claims of unnecessary segregation under the \nintegration mandate. \nDefendant incorrectly argues that certain state court hearings, known as Section \n122c proceedings, preclude Plaintiffs’ federal integration mandate claims under \nprinciples of res judicata and collateral estoppel.  Mot. to Dismiss at 15–17.  North \nCarolina state courts conduct Section 122c proceedings to review placements of foster \nchildren in PRTFs and determine whether the children should remain institutionalized.  \nN.C.G.S. § 122c-224.3.  Under North Carolina law, a presiding judge in a Section 122c \nproceeding must find that “lesser measures will be insufficient” before authorizing a \nchild’s continued stay in a PRTF.  N.C.G.S. § 122c-224.3(f).  Defendant contends that \nSection 122c proceedings give foster children a “full and fair opportunity” to litigate \nclaims that they are unnecessarily segregated in PRTFs.  Mot. to Dismiss at 17.  But \nSection 122c proceedings consider different evidence and apply a different legal standard \nthan the integration mandate requires, and so they have no preclusive effect on Plaintiffs’ \nclaims.    \nSince Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) is “intended to address the legal \nadequacy of the complaint, and not to address the merits of any affirmative defenses,” \nincluding collateral estoppel and res judicata,5 courts considering motions to dismiss \nunder Rule 12(b)(6) only consider collateral estoppel and res judicata arguments in \n                                                 \n \n5 Richmond, Fredericksburg & Potomac R.R. Co. v. Forst, 4 F.3d 244, 250 (4th Cir. \n1993) (collateral estoppel and res judicata are affirmative defenses).   \n14 \n \nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 57   Filed 04/21/23   Page 14 of 25\n\n“limited circumstances.”  Id.  Collateral estoppel, or issue preclusion, bars parties from \nre-litigating issues of fact or law that are identical to issues that were decided in a prior \nlitigation in which the party to be estopped had a full and fair opportunity to litigate.  \nVirginia Hosp. Ass’n v. Baliles, 830 F.2d 1308, 1311 (4th Cir. 1987).  Res judicata, or \nclaim preclusion, bars parties from relitigating claims that were decided by a prior final \njudgment on the merits, where the previous litigation involved identical parties (or parties \nin privity) and was based on the same cause of action.  Duckett v. Fuller, 819 F.3d 740, \n744 (4th Cir. 2016).  Res judicata similarly prevents parties from “contesting matters that \nthey have had a full and fair opportunity to litigate.”  Id.     \nState court proceedings that consider different facts and apply different legal \nstandards than those required under the ADA are not preclusive.  Cf. Jonathan R. by \nDixon v. Justice, 41 F.4th 316, 335 (4th Cir. 2022) (holding that the lower court should \nnot have abstained from hearing integration mandate claims in deference to state-court \nproceedings, because the state court proceedings—unlike claims under the integration \nmandate—could only operate “within the existing parameters of the foster-care system” \nand could not “pause to ponder” the absence of integrated placements), cert. denied sub \nnom. Justice v. Jonathan R., 143 S. Ct. 310 (2022).  If a state court proceeding does not \nprovide a claimant with a full and fair opportunity to litigate alleged violations of the \nintegration mandate, then it cannot bar a subsequent federal court action under the \ndoctrines of collateral estoppel and res judicata.  Contrary to Defendant’s argument, \nSection 122c proceedings do not present an opportunity for foster children to litigate \n15 \n \nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 57   Filed 04/21/23   Page 15 of 25\n\nclaims that they have been unnecessarily institutionalized in violation of the integration \nmandate. \nUnder the integration mandate, public entities must reasonably modify their \ncommunity-based services to make those services available to people with disabilities \nwho want and are eligible for them.  Olmstead, 527 U.S. at 591; 28 C.F.R. \n§§ 35.130(b)(7), (d).  When considering integration mandate claims, courts must \ntherefore assess whether people with disabilities could be served in the community if \nappropriate services were available to them.  Olmstead, 527 U.S. at 602.  \nBy contrast, courts in Section 122c proceedings need only consider less restrictive \nalternatives that are actually available at the time of the proceeding.  In re M.B., 771 \nS.E.2d 615, 626 (N.C. App. 2015).  In M.B., a juvenile appealed his continued placement \nin a PRTF after a Section 122c proceeding, arguing that he should have been placed in a \nless restrictive setting as his treating professionals recommended.  Id.  The North \nCarolina Court of Appeals denied his appeal.  The Court explained that the legislative \nintent behind Section 122c was to provide mental health services “within available \nresources” in “the least restrictive, therapeutically most appropriate setting \navailable.”  Id. (emphasis in original).  The Court affirmed the juvenile’s placement in a \nPRTF because “there were no sufficient, less restrictive measures available for [his] \ncontinued treatment.”  Id.  In short, courts presiding over Section 122c proceedings are \nnot required to analyze—or even consider—whether community-based services could be \nmade available through reasonable modifications.  Section 122c proceedings therefore do \n16 \n \nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 57   Filed 04/21/23   Page 16 of 25\n\nnot give children an opportunity to argue that they have been unnecessarily segregated in \nviolation of the ADA.   \nThe Fourth Circuit recently considered a similar case and held that state court \nproceedings did not bar foster children from bringing claims under the integration \nmandate in federal court.  Jonathan R., 41 F.4th at 321–22.  In Jonathan R., a putative \nclass of foster children alleged that West Virginia’s administration of its child welfare \nservices resulted in the children’s unnecessary institutionalization.  Id.  The State argued \nthat because state courts review and approve foster children’s placements, the federal \ncourts should abstain from considering the children’s integration mandate claims in \ndeference to the state court proceedings.  Id.  Although the Jonathan R. court considered \nwhether plaintiffs’ claims were barred under abstention doctrines, the court made factual \nfindings that apply equally to the facts of this case.  The court found that, like Plaintiffs \nhere, the foster children had alleged “wide-reaching, intertwined, and systemic failures \nthat [could] not be remedied through piecemeal orders” in state court proceedings.  41 \nF.4th at 336 (internal quotations omitted).  The court commented that, as a practical \nmatter, “[r]eforming foster care case-by-case would be like patching up holes in a sinking \nship by tearing off the floorboards.”  Id. at 336.  Since the State’s “individual periodic \nhearings [did] not provide an appropriate forum for a multi-faceted class-action \nchallenge,” the court held that the foster children’s integration mandate claims should be \nallowed to proceed in federal court.  Id. at 339.  The same reasoning applies here.  \nSection 122c proceedings do not provide an opportunity to fully litigate integration \n17 \n \nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 57   Filed 04/21/23   Page 17 of 25\n\nmandate claims because those proceedings are ill-suited to resolve the kinds of systemic, \nstate-wide violations the ADA was designed to address and that Plaintiffs allege in this \ncase.  Plaintiffs’ integration mandate claims should likewise be allowed to proceed. \nD.  A public entity that designs, operates, and funds a service system for people \nwith disabilities must ensure that its system complies with the integration \nmandate.   \nDefendant argues that Named Plaintiffs lack standing to bring their integration \nclaims because their unnecessary segregation lacks a causal connection to DHHS’s \nactions and is unlikely to be redressed by the relief sought.  Mot. to Dismiss at 19, citing \nLujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560–61 (1992).  Defendant argues that \nNamed Plaintiffs’ alleged injuries were caused by actions and decisions of county- and \nregional-level entities, not by any actions of DHHS.  Mot. to Dismiss at 19–20.  \nDefendant further argues that the systemic relief Plaintiffs seek—requiring DHHS to \nmake community-based services available, and to transition children in foster care to \ncommunity-based settings—would not necessarily redress Named Plaintiffs’ injuries.  \nThese arguments are misplaced.   \nPublic entities must ensure that all of their services, programs, and activities \ncomply with Title II of the ADA.  Third parties often play a key role in administering \npublic services, but the public entity that operates, designs, and funds the service system \nremains responsible for ADA compliance.  28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(3)(i) (prohibiting \npublic entities from discriminating against people with disabilities both directly and \n“through contractual, licensing, or other arrangements”).  Even if a state arranges for \n18 \n \nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 57   Filed 04/21/23   Page 18 of 25\n\nservices to be administered by “a[nother] public entity that has its own title II \nobligations,” the state “is still responsible for ensuring that the other public entity \ncomplies with title II in providing those services.”  28 C.F.R. pt. 35, app. A.       \nHere, Plaintiffs allege that DHHS administers its service system for foster children \nwith disabilities in a manner that results in the children’s unnecessary segregation.  As \nthe agency that oversees and operates the service system, DHHS must ensure that its \nservice system comports with the ADA, regardless of whether it has assigned certain \nresponsibilities to third parties.  Mot. to Dismiss at 4, 6 (admitting that DHHS oversees \nthe service systems at issue); e.g. Marks v. Colorado Dep’t of Corr., 976 F.3d 1087, 1096 \n(10th Cir. 2020); Castle v. Eurofresh, Inc., 731 F.3d 901, 910 (9th Cir. 2013).  Most \npublicly-funded service systems rely on private providers to deliver services, and courts \nconsistently hold public entities liable under the integration mandate for their \nadministration of services that are provided by private parties.6  \nIn an analogous integration mandate case also involving Medicaid services, this \nCourt recognized that since DHHS is the single state agency responsible for \n                                                 \n \n6 E.g. Pashby v.

Supp. 2d 184, 373–74 \n(holding state agencies liable under the integration mandate for their administration of the \nstate’s mental health service system, even though privately-run facilities provided the \nservices at issue); Radaszewski, 383 F.3d at 614–15 (reversing judgment on the pleadings \nand holding that state agency’s eligibility criteria for its waiver program that placed \nplaintiff at serious risk of entering a private long-term care facility could violate the \nintegration mandate); Fisher v.

Delia, No. 1:10-CV-123, 2012 WL 5381488, at *5 (M.D.N.C. Oct. 31, \n2012) (the Secretary of DHHS must “‘ensure continuous compliance by area authorities, \ncounty programs, and all providers of public services with State and federal policy, law, \nand standards,’” including Title II of the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act) (quoting \nN.C.G.S. § 122C-112.1(a)(6)).    \nPlaintiffs need not clear a high bar to plead a causal connection between a public \nentity’s action or inaction and plaintiffs’ resulting segregation.  At the motion to dismiss \nstage, even “scant” allegations may be enough to show causation under the integration \nmandate.  Est. of Valentine by & through Grate v. South Carolina, 611 F. Supp. 3d 99, \n120 (D.S.C. 2019) (holding that plaintiff who brought an integration mandate claim had \nsufficiently pled causation to withstand a motion to dismiss).  Courts consistently find \nthat plaintiffs have standing where they allege that they are eligible for community-based \nservices but the defendant public entity that oversees those services fails to ensure that \nthe services are actually available.  E.g. M.G. v. New York State Off. of Mental Health, \n572 F. Supp. 3d 1, 12 (S.D.N.Y. 2021) (holding that plaintiffs had standing to bring claim \n                                                 \n \nprescriptions placing plaintiffs at serious risk of entering a privately-owned nursing \nfacility could violate the integration mandate); Townsend v. Quasim, 328 F.3d 511, 513 \n(9th Cir. 2003) (reversing summary judgment for state and holding that the state’s refusal \nto offer community-based in-home nursing services to some disabled persons may violate \nthe integration mandate). \n20 \n \nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 57   Filed 04/21/23   Page 20 of 25\n\nagainst a defendant state entity and had adequately pled causation despite the entity’s \nargument that plaintiffs’ injuries were “more directly caused by deficiencies on the part \nof the private or municipal organizations”).7  The bar for pleading redressability is \nsimilarly low.  To satisfy the redressability element of standing, a plaintiff need only \nshow that “it is likely, as opposed to merely speculative, that the injury will be redressed \nby a favorable decision.”  Deal v. Mercer Cty. Bd. of Educ., 911 F.3d 183, 189–90 (4th \nCir. 2018) (internal quotation omitted).  Plaintiffs can successfully plead redressability by \nalleging that they “would benefit in a tangible way” from court intervention; they do not \nneed to show that a favorable decision would relieve all of their injuries.  Id.   \nPlaintiffs here allege that DHHS caused their unnecessary segregation or placed \nthem at risk of unnecessary segregation through its administration of statewide programs \nand services.  Am. Compl. ¶¶ 3, 14, 187–98.    Plaintiffs allege that DHHS oversees all of \nthe programs and services at issue, including Medicaid, the state child welfare program, \nand other state-funded programs.  Am. Compl. ¶¶ 144, 168–83.  Although DHHS assigns \n                                                 \n \n7 See also Murphy, 260 F. Supp. 3d at 1102 (D. Minn. 2017) (there was “little question \nthat Plaintiffs ha[d] adequately established causation” to support standing where plaintiffs \nalleged that the public entity that oversaw services failed to ensure that people with \ndisabilities could actually receive those services) (internal quotation omitted); \nGuggenberger v. Minnesota, 198 F. Supp. 3d 973, 992 (D. Minn. 2016) (plaintiffs \n“established the requisite causal connection” to show standing by alleging that the agency \ncharged with administering the State’s Medicaid program had mismanaged the program, \nunderspent on community-based services, and allowed plaintiffs to remain on waiting \nlists); Parrales v. Dudek, No. 15-CV-424, 2015 WL 13373978, at *4 (N.D. Fla. Dec. 24, \n2015) (holding that plaintiffs had standing to bring claim against a defendant state entity \nand had satisfied the causation requirement despite the entity’s argument that managed \ncare organizations had caused plaintiffs’ alleged injuries). \n21 \n \nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 57   Filed 04/21/23   Page 21 of 25\n\nsome tasks to county entities, Plaintiffs allege—and Defendant concedes—that the \ncounty entities are “agents of DHHS.”  Am. Compl. ¶¶ 17, 172 (“DHHS directs, controls, \nand is liable for the acts and omissions of county departments of social services, who act \nas DHHS’s agents in the delivery of services to children in foster care”); Mot. to Dismiss \nat 6 (“the director of a county DSS [Department of Social Services] ‘acts as agent of \nthe . . . Department of Health and Human Services’”) (quoting N.C.G.S. § 108A-\n14(a)(5)).  Both Defendant and Plaintiffs agree that DHHS oversees the local and county \nentities, including the entities’ administration of child welfare functions.  Am. Compl. \n¶¶ 144, 172; Mot. to Dismiss at 6–7.  Plaintiffs further allege that DHHS, both directly \nand through its agents, is responsible for Named Plaintiffs’ institutionalization or risk of \ninstitutionalization in PRTFs; for example, by failing to make community-based services \navailable to children who need them to avoid institutionalization, and failing to identify \nappropriate long-term community-based placements for children instead of \ninstitutionalizing them.  Am. Compl. ¶¶ 5, 13, 14, 46, 66, 79, 95, 116.   \nThese allegations are enough to establish a causal connection between DHHS’s \nactions and Named Plaintiffs’ resulting segregation or risk of segregation.  Plaintiffs have \nlikewise cleared the low bar for pleading redressability, because an injunction requiring \nDHHS to modify its service system—so that community-based services are actually \navailable to children who need them—would more than likely address Named Plaintiffs’ \ninjuries.   \n \n22 \n \nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 57   Filed 04/21/23   Page 22 of 25\n\nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, the United States requests that the Court consider this \nStatement of Interest in this litigation. \n  Respectfully submitted, \n   \nApril 21, 2023  SANDRA J.

(Doc. 40.) \nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 72   Filed 03/29/24   Page 1 of 51\n\nFor the reasons explained below, this court will deny \nDefendant’s Motion to Dismiss. \nI.  FACTUAL AND LEGAL BACKGROUND \nOn a motion to dismiss, a court must “accept as true all of \nthe factual allegations contained in the complaint and draw all \nreasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiff.” Ray v. Roane, \n948 F.3d 222, 226 (4th Cir. 2020) (internal quotation marks \nomitted) (quoting King v. Rubenstein, 825 F.3d 206, 212 (4th \nCir. 2016)). The facts, taken in the light most favorable to \nPlaintiffs, are as follows. Additional facts will be discussed \nin the analysis as necessary. \nPlaintiffs are children with disabilities who are in the \ncustody of North Carolina’s child welfare system. (Am. Class \nAction Compl. for Declaratory and Inj. Relief (“Compl.”) \n(Doc. 35) ¶¶ 1, 5.)1 Plaintiffs filed an Amended Complaint on \nMarch 6, 2023, naming Kody Kinsley in his official capacity as \nSecretary of the North Carolina Department of Health of Human \nServices (“DHHS” or “Defendant”) as Defendant. (See id. ¶ 141.) \nDefendant “oversees and operates all aspects of the North \nCarolina child welfare system.” (Id. ¶ 144.)  \n \n1 All citations in this Memorandum Opinion and Order to \ndocuments filed with the court refer to the page numbers located \nat the bottom right-hand corner of the documents as they appear \non CM/ECF.   \n- 2 - \nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 72   Filed 03/29/24   Page 2 of 51\n\nPlaintiffs allege Defendant discriminates against children \nwith disabilities within the North Carolina child welfare system \nby unnecessarily segregating them from their home communities \nand routinely isolating them in institutions knowns as \npsychiatric residential treatment facilities (“PRTFs”), in \nviolation of Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act \n(“Title II”), 42 USC §§ 12131 et seq., and Section 504 of the \nRehabilitation Act (“Section 504”), 29 U.S.C. §§ 794 et seq. \n(Id. ¶¶ 1, 12.) “PRTFs are designed to provide intensive, \nshort-term, residential psychiatric treatment for temporary \nstabilization.” (Id. ¶ 4.)   \nAs a public entity, Defendant is required to comply with \nTitle II and Section 504. (Id. ¶ 269.) Both Title II and Section \n504 prohibit discrimination on the basis of disability. See 42 \nU.S.C. § 12132; 29 U.S.C. § 794.2 In order to implement the \nanti-discrimination provisions of Title II, the Attorney General \nhas issued two relevant regulations: the integration mandate, 28 \n \n2 “Claims under the ADA's Title II and the Rehabilitation \nAct can be combined for analytical purposes because the analysis \nis substantially the same.” Wicomico Nursing Home v. Padilla, \n910 F.3d 739, 750 (4th Cir. 2018) (internal quotation marks \nomitted) (quoting Seremeth v. Bd. of Cnty. Comm'rs Frederick \nCnty., 673 F.3d 333, 336 n.1 (4th Cir. 2012)). For ease of \nreference, this court will discuss both Title II and Section 504 \nin terms of the ADA’s Title II. \n- 3 - \nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 72   Filed 03/29/24   Page 3 of 51\n\nC.F.R. § 35.130(d), and the methods of administration \nregulation, 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(3). \nThe “integration mandate” requires a public entity to \n“administer services, programs, and activities in the most \nintegrated setting appropriate to the needs of qualified \nindividuals with disabilities.” 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(d). The \n“methods of administration” regulation prohibits public entities \nfrom utilizing “criteria or methods of administration . . . \n[t]hat have the effect of subjecting qualified individuals with \ndisabilities to discrimination.” 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(3)(i).  \nIn Olmstead v. L.C. ex rel. Zimring, 527 U.S. 581 (1999), \nthe Supreme Court, relying on the integration mandate, \nrecognized unjustified institutional isolation of persons with \ndisabilities as a form of discrimination. Id. at 597. “Since \nOlmstead, public entities and courts . . . have grappled \nwith . . . what is required to satisfy the Integration Mandate.” \nDay v. District of Columbia, 894 F. Supp. 2d 1, 7 (D.D.C. 2012); \nsee Darian B. Taylor, Annotation, Unjustified \nInstitutionalization of Individuals with Disabilities as \nViolation of Federal Antidiscrimination Provisions — Post-\nOlmstead Cases, 90 A.L.R. Fed. 2d 1 § 2 (2014) (“As a result of \nthe Olmstead decision, disabled persons both in and out of state \ninstitutions have engaged in what has become known as ‘Olmstead \n- 4 - \nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 72   Filed 03/29/24   Page 4 of 51\n\nlitigation’ — suits filed often as class actions alleging that a \nstate entity has discriminated against those individuals under \nthe ADA and RA by failing to provide community-based treatment \nservices that would either allow them to be released from \ninstitutionalization or that jeopardize their ability to remain \nin their home or community and outside the confines of an \ninstitution.”).  \nPlaintiffs’ discrimination claims are based on two separate \nbut related theories: (1) a failure by Defendant to provide \nchild welfare services in the most integrated setting \nappropriate, in violation of the integration mandate and \nOlmstead; and (2) employing criteria or methods of \nadministration that prioritize or permit unjustified \ninstitutionalization of Plaintiffs, in violation of the “methods \nof administration” regulation. (Compl. (Doc. 35) ¶¶ 273, 274, \n277–80.) \nPlaintiffs allege “Defendant has a pervasive, system-wide \npractice of unnecessarily segregating children in its care in \nPRTF institutions instead of providing care and placement for \nthem in their communities.” (Id. ¶ 187.) While Defendant \n“ostensibly offers community-based placements and services,” the \navailability of such services is too limited — fueling an \noverreliance on placement in PRTFs. (Id. ¶ 14.) Children with \n- 5 - \nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 72   Filed 03/29/24   Page 5 of 51\n\ndisabilities in North Carolina’s child welfare system face \nsignificant barriers to accessing community-based placements and \nservices, including “shortages or waitlists for intensive in-\nhome services, crisis intervention services, outpatient mental \nhealth and substance abuse services, and inadequate \ntransportation to and from such services.” (Id.) However, \ninstead of addressing these barriers and expanding community-\nbased placements and services, Defendant sends children to PRTFs \n“because it has nowhere else to put them.” (Id.) \nDefendant is “a principal department of the North Carolina \nExecutive Branch with wide-ranging functions, powers, duties, \nand obligations.” (Id. ¶ 144.) The Complaint outlines the \nvarious divisions within Defendant’s department, as they relate \nto the child welfare care system in North Carolina:  \nThe  DSS  (Division  of  Social  Services)  within  DHHS \nsupervises and provides technical assistance to county \nDSS offices, which make placement decisions for youth in \nfoster care, including PRTF placement. The Division of \nHealth Services Regulation (“DHSR”) within DHHS monitors \nand oversees all licensed mental health facilities in \nNorth Carolina, including PRTFs. DHHS administers North \nCarolina’s statewide Medicaid program (“NC Medicaid”) \nthrough  its  Division  of  Health  Benefits.  DHHS  also \noversees  mental  health  and  developmental  disability \nservices,  including  treatment  at  PRTFs,  through  its \nDivision of Mental Health, Developmental Disabilities, \nand  Substance  Abuse  Services  (“DMH/DD/SAS”).  This \ndivision  is  also  responsible  for  ensuring  that \nhigh-quality mental health and developmental disability \nservices are available to people that need them. The \nDMH/DD/SAS  division  contains  the  statutorily-created \nCommission for Mental Health, Developmental Disabilities \n- 6 - \nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 72   Filed 03/29/24   Page 6 of 51\n\nand Substance Abuse Services, which has the authority to \nadopt and repeal rules pertaining to all mental health \nprograms,  including  operating  standards  for  licensed \nmental health facilities such as PRTFs. \n \n(Id.) Defendant is “statutorily responsible for supervising the \nregional- and county-level administration of North Carolina’s \nchild welfare system.” (Id. ¶ 150.)  \nDefendant also administers North Carolina’s statewide \nMedicaid program through its Division of Health Benefits. (Id. \n¶ 144.) Plaintiffs allege children within the putative class are \neligible for community-based services provided through the \nstatewide Medicaid program but are unable to receive these \nservices in an integrated setting. (Id. ¶ 277.) As a result, \nPlaintiffs are forced into institutions to receive care, which \nis isolating and often inadequate. (Id. ¶ 14.) \n From fiscal year 2020 to 2021, Defendant placed at least \n572 children in PRTFs, including Named Plaintiffs, referred to \nby the pseudonyms Timothy B., Flora P., Isabella A., Steph C., \nand London R. (Id. ¶ 5.) Named Plaintiffs bring this action on \n- 7 - \nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 72   Filed 03/29/24   Page 7 of 51\n\nbehalf of themselves, through their Guardians Ad Litem,3 and a \nputative class of similarly situated children. (Id. ¶ 154.) \nTwo advocacy organizations, Disability Rights North \nCarolina (“DRNC”) and the North Carolina State Conference of \nNAACP (“NC NAACP”) (together, “Associational Plaintiffs”), join \nNamed Plaintiffs in this action as associational plaintiffs. \n(Id. ¶¶ 25, 32.) DRNC is an independent nonprofit organization \norganized under the laws of the State of North Carolina. (Id. \n¶ 25.) DRNC is designated as the statutorily authorized \nProtection and Advocacy system for the State of North Carolina, \ncharged with protecting and advocating for the rights of \nindividuals with disabilities. (Id. ¶ 27.) Named Plaintiffs and \nmembers of the putative class are constituents of DRNC. (Id. \n¶ 28.)  The NC NAACP is a membership-based nonprofit civil \nrights organization whose mission is to “ensure the rights of \nall persons to equality and to eliminate racial discrimination.” \n(Id. ¶ 32.) African Americans and children of color within the \nputative class, such as Flora P., Steph C., and London R., are \nconstituents of NC NAACP. (Id. ¶ 36, 38.) Plaintiffs allege \n \n3 Robert Ward represents Named Plaintiffs Timothy B. and \nFlora P. (Id. ¶¶ 129–32.) Jeffrey C. Holden represents Named \nPlaintiffs Isabella A. and Steph C. (Id. ¶¶ 133–36.) Meghann \nGunderman Sehorn represents London R. (Id. ¶ 137–38.) All three \nGuardians Ad Litem have met with the Named Plaintiffs they seek \nto represent and are “dedicated to serving [their] best \ninterests in this litigation.” (Id. ¶¶ 132, 136, 160.)   \n- 8 - \nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 72   Filed 03/29/24   Page 8 of 51\n\nchildren of color are disproportionately affected by the harms \nassociated with DHHS’s overreliance on PRTFs. (Id. ¶ 224.) \nPlaintiffs allege Defendant violates the integration \nmandate by failing to provide children with disabilities in the \nchild welfare system with community-based services — forcing \nchildren into institutions to receive needed care when \ninstitutionalization would not otherwise be necessary. (Id. \n¶ 261.) Children with disabilities face a long waitlist for \nthese services, which is driven by the high employee vacancy \nrate at DHHS. (Id. ¶ 260.) Additionally, Defendant fails to \nmaintain an adequate number of community-based placements and \nlicensed foster families. (Id. ¶ 243.)  \nMoreover, the treatment and services Named Plaintiffs \nreceive in PRTFs are, at best, inadequate, and, at worst, highly \nabusive. (See id. ¶ 5.) Named Plaintiffs “regularly face trauma \nwithin PRTFs.” (Id.) They are “confined to prison-like settings \nunder the care of a poorly trained and understaffed workforce;” \nsubject to physical, emotional, and sexual abuse; “face mental \nhealth deterioration;” and are placed on “heavy cocktails of \nmind-altering psychotropic medications.” (Id.) Furthermore, more \nthan a third of children in PRTFs are sent to out of state \ninstitutions that are “too far for their caseworkers to keep an \neye on their safety or for their families to visit them.” (Id. \n- 9 - \nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 72   Filed 03/29/24   Page 9 of 51\n\n¶ 8.) Children of color are disproportionately represented in \nthe foster care system, and, within the system, “Black and Brown \nchildren with disabilities are disproportionately confined to \nPRTFs.” (Id. ¶ 6.) \nIf Defendant made more community-based programs and \nservices available, it would allow children with disabilities to \nlive in the community and receive care in the most integrated \nsetting appropriate. (See id. ¶ 3.) Plaintiffs allege that \nDefendant has the resources and ability to provide expanded \ncommunity-based options, but instead spends a disproportionate \namount of resources on institutional care settings. (Id. ¶ 16.) \nPlaintiffs allege that “community-based placements are more \neffective, yield better outcomes for children, and are less \ncostly.” (Id. ¶ 15.) \nRelatedly, Plaintiffs allege “Defendant has a policy and \npractice of discriminating against the Named Plaintiffs and the \nputative class based on disability by relying on criteria or \nmethods of administration” which result in unnecessary \ninstitutionalization. (Id. ¶ 279.) Those criteria or methods of \nadministration include: \ngrossly  disparate  funding  of  PRTFs  rather  than \ncommunity-based  placements  and  supportive  mental  and \nbehavioral  health  services;  failing  to  expand \ncommunity-based  foster  care  placements,  including \nkinship and “fictive” kinship placements and therapeutic \nfoster  care;  and  failing  to  expand  access  to, \n- 10 - \nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 72   Filed 03/29/24   Page 10 of 51\n\nmaintaining waitlists for, and/or permitting shortages \nof  community-based  intensive  in  home  services, \ncommunity-based  wrap-around  services,  community-based \ncrisis  intervention  services,  and  community-based \noutpatient mental and behavioral health services. \n \n(Id.) \nPlaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief. \nPlaintiffs request this court award prospective permanent \ninjunctive relief, including but not limited to, requiring \nDefendant to: \na. Administer its programs such that it has available a \nsufficient  supply  of  integrated,  community-based \nplacements and services to meet the needs of children \nwith mental impairments in foster care; \nb.  Implement  and  sustain  an  effective  system  for \ntransitioning children with mental impairments in foster \ncare  out  of  PRTFs  into  integrated,  community-based \nplacements and services; and \nc. Make reasonable accommodations or modifications, as \nnecessary,  to  meet  the  needs  of  North  Carolina’s \nchildren  with  mental  impairments  in  foster  care  in \nintegrated, community-based placements and services. \n \n(Id. at 76–77.) Plaintiffs also request an injunction requiring \nDefendant to “[m]odify or develop and implement policies and \npractices as necessary to cease its violations of the statutory \nrights of children with disabilities in foster care placed or at \nserious risk of placement in PRTFs.” (Id. at 77.) \n  The Complaint contains two causes of action asserted on \nbehalf of Named Plaintiffs, the putative class, and \nAssociational Plaintiffs: (1) discrimination in violation of \nTitle II of the ADA; and (2) discrimination in violation of \n- 11 - \nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 72   Filed 03/29/24   Page 11 of 51\n\nSection 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. (Id. ¶¶ 267–301.) \nDefendant’s motion to dismiss argues: (1) Plaintiffs do not have \nstanding; (2) Plaintiffs fail to state an Olmstead claim; and \n(3) Plaintiffs’ claims are barred by issue preclusion. (Mem. in \nSupp. of Def.’s Mot. to Dismiss (“Def.’s Br.”) (Doc. 41) at 8–\n9.) For the following reasons, Defendant’s motion to dismiss \nwill be denied. \nII.  PROCEDURAL HISTORY \nOn March 6, 2023, Plaintiffs filed their Amended Class \nAction Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief. (Compl. \n(Doc. 35).) On March 20, 2023, Defendant filed a Motion to \nDismiss Plaintiffs’ Amended Complaint for failure to state a \nclaim, or, alternatively, for lack of standing, (Mot. to Dismiss \nPls.’ Am. Compl. (“Def.’s Mot.”) (Doc. 40)), and a memorandum in \nsupport, (Def.’s Br. (Doc. 41)). Plaintiffs filed a response in \nopposition, (Pls.’ Opp. to Def.’s Mot. to Dismiss (“Pls.’ \nResp.”) (Doc. 53)), and Defendant replied, (Reply in Supp. of \nDef.’s Mot. to Dismiss (“Def.’s Reply”) (Doc. 58)). On April 21, \n2023, the United States filed a Statement of Interest pursuant \nto 28 U.S.C. § 517 to provide its views regarding the legal \nstandard for stating a claim under Title II and Section 504. \n(Statement of Interest of the United States of America \n(“Statement of Interest”) (Doc. 57).) \n- 12 - \nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 72   Filed 03/29/24   Page 12 of 51\n\nIII.  MOTION TO DISMISS FOR LACK OF SUBJECT MATTER JURISDICTION \nDefendant moves to dismiss Plaintiffs’ Amended Complaint \nunder Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) for lack of \nstanding. (See Def.’s Mot. (Doc. 40) at 1.) \nA.  Standard of Review \nA defendant may challenge subject-matter jurisdiction \nfacially or factually. See Kerns v. United States, 585 F.3d 187, \n192 (4th Cir. 2009). In a facial challenge, a defendant asserts \nthat the allegations, taken as true, are insufficient to \nestablish subject-matter jurisdiction. Id. The court then \neffectively affords a plaintiff “the same procedural protection \nas he would receive under a Rule 12(b)(6) consideration,” taking \nthe alleged facts as true and denying the Rule 12(b)(1) motion \nif the complaint “alleges sufficient facts to invoke subject \nmatter jurisdiction.” Id. The party seeking to invoke the \nfederal court’s jurisdiction has the burden of establishing \nstanding. Miller v. Brown, 462 F.3d 312, 316 (4th Cir. 2006). \nHere, Defendant asserts a facial challenge to Plaintiffs’ \nstanding. (See Def.’s Br. (Doc. 41) at 24–25.) \nB.  Analysis \nDefendant argues Plaintiffs lack standing because they \ncannot show “that the individual Named Plaintiffs’ alleged \ninjuries were caused by DHHS or are likely to be redressed by \n- 13 - \nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 72   Filed 03/29/24   Page 13 of 51\n\nthe relief the Plaintiffs seek.” (Id. at 25.) Defendant further \nargues that the Associational Plaintiffs lack standing because \nthe organizations cannot assert representative standing. (Id. \nat 28.) \nTo establish standing, a plaintiff must demonstrate three \nelements: (1) that the plaintiff has suffered an injury in fact \nthat is “concrete and particularized” and “actual or imminent”; \n(2) that the injury is fairly traceable to the challenged \nconduct of the defendant; and (3) that a favorable decision is \nlikely to redress the injury. Lujan v. Defs. of Wildlife, 504 \nU.S. 555, 560–61 (1992). “At least one plaintiff must \ndemonstrate standing for each claim and form of requested \nrelief.” Kenny v. Wilson, 885 F.3d 280, 287 (4th Cir. 2018.) \nPlaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief. (Compl. \n(Doc. 35) at 76–77.) \n1.   Individually Named Plaintiffs \nNamed plaintiffs who purport to represent a class must \nallege that they personally have standing. Lewis v. Casey, 518 \nU.S. 343, 357 (1996). “[O]nce it is established that at least \none party has standing to bring the claim, no further inquiry is \nrequired as to another party’s standing to bring that claim.” \n- 14 - \nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 72   Filed 03/29/24   Page 14 of 51\n\nMaryland Shall Issue, Inc. v. Hogan, 971 F.3d 199, 209 (4th Cir. \n2020). \na.  Injury \nTo establish standing, a plaintiff’s injury must be “(a) \nconcrete and particularized, and (b) actual or imminent, not \nconjectural or hypothetical.” Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560 (internal \ncitations, quotation marks, and footnote omitted). When \nplaintiffs seek prospective relief, they must establish an \nongoing or imminent injury in fact. O'Shea v. Littleton, 414 \nU.S. 488, 495–96 (1974).   \nPlaintiffs sufficiently allege, and Defendant does not \ndispute, that at least one Named Plaintiff has suffered a \nlegally cognizable injury under Article III. (See Def.’s Br. \n(Doc. 41) at 24 (disputing causation and redressability, but not \ninjury).) A failure to receive services in the most integrated \nsetting appropriate to the needs of qualified individuals with \ndisabilities is a legally cognizable injury. See Olmstead v. \nL.C. ex. rel. Zimring, 527 U.S. 581, 597 (1999). \nPlaintiffs allege Named Plaintiffs have failed to receive \nchild welfare services in the most integrated setting \nappropriate to their needs. Timothy B., Isabella A., and London \nR. have failed to receive community-based placements and \nservices, even though community-based placements and services \n- 15 - \nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 72   Filed 03/29/24   Page 15 of 51\n\nare appropriate to their needs, resulting in unnecessary \ninstitutionalization in PRTFs. (Compl. (Doc. 35) ¶¶ 41, 46, 75, \n81, 111, 117.) Because at least one Named Plaintiff has suffered \na legally cognizable injury, this court need not consider \nwhether other Named Plaintiffs have standing to seek that same \nform of relief.4 See Carolina Youth Action Project v. Wilson, 60 \nF.4th 770, 778 (4th Cir. 2023) (declining to consider whether \nother plaintiffs have standing after concluding at least one of \nthe named plaintiffs had standing). \nb.  Causation \nAs to the causation requirement, the injury must be “fairly \ntraceable” to the defendant's conduct. This does not mean that \nthe plaintiffs must prove to an absolute certainty that the \ndefendant's actions caused or are likely to cause injury; rather \nthe “plaintiffs need only show that there is a substantial \nlikelihood that defendant's conduct caused plaintiffs' harm.” \nPub. Int. Rsch. Grp. of N.J., Inc. v. Powell Duffryn Terminals \n \n4 Plaintiffs argue that Flora P. and Steph C. have standing \nbecause both were institutionalized when the suit was originally \nfiled, were discharged before Plaintiffs filed their Amended \nComplaint, and remain at serious risk of re-\ninstitutionalization. (Pls.’ Resp. (Doc. 53) at 21 n.2.) This \ncourt need not determine at this time whether Flora P. and Steph \nC. have suffered a legally cognizable injury but notes that \n“when a plaintiff files a complaint in federal court and then \nvoluntarily amends the complaint, courts look to the amended \ncomplaint to determine jurisdiction.” Rockwell Int’l Corp. v. \nU.S., 549 U.S. 457, 473–74 (2007).  \n- 16 - \nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 72   Filed 03/29/24   Page 16 of 51\n\nInc., 913 F.2d 64, 72 (3d Cir. 1990) (quoting Duke Power Co. v. \nCarolina Env‘t Study Grp., Inc., 438 U.S. 59, 75 n.20 (1978)) \n(internal quotation marks omitted). While this standard excludes \nany injury that is “the result of the independent action of some \nthird party not before the court, . . . [it] does not exclude \ninjury produced by determinative or coercive effect upon the \naction of someone else.” Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 169 \n(1997) (cleaned up). \nDefendant argues there is no causal link between \nDefendant’s conduct and the alleged injuries because “the \nindividual Named Plaintiffs’ placements and services are \ndetermined by the county DSSs and the [Local Management \nEntities/Managed Care Organizations]; the Complaint does not \nallege that the individual Named Plaintiffs’ placements were the \nresult of any action by the DHHS.” (Def.’s Br. (Doc. 41) at 25.)  \nHere, Plaintiffs sufficiently allege a causal connection \nbetween Defendant and the alleged injury. This is not a case \nwhere “the actions of an independent third party . . . st[and] \nbetween the plaintiff and the challenged actions.” (Id. at 26 \n(quoting Frank Krasner Enters. Ltd. v. Montgomery Cnty., 401 \nF.3d 230, 235 (4th Cir. 2005)).) Plaintiffs lay out detailed \nallegations of the “explicit principal-agent relationship” \n- 17 - \nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 72   Filed 03/29/24   Page 17 of 51\n\nestablished by North Carolina law between Defendant and the \ncounty departments. (Compl. (Doc. 35) ¶¶ 172, 178.) \nFurthermore, Plaintiffs are not required to allege that \nDefendant made the individual placement decisions because \nPlaintiffs’ claims are not based on those individual placement \ndecisions — they are based on Defendant’s administrative and \nsupervisory role overseeing North Carolina’s child welfare \nsystem. (Id. ¶ 280.) Thus, Plaintiffs have pled a causal \nconnection. See Day v. Dist. of Columbia, 894 F. Supp. 2d 1, 22 \n(D.D.C. 2012) (“[T]o allege the necessary ‘causal connection’ \nbetween the District’s actions and plaintiffs’ injury,” the \nplaintiffs need not allege the District placed them in the \nfacility.); M.G. v. N.Y. State Off. of Mental Health, 572 F. \nSupp. 3d 1, 12–13 (S.D.N.Y. 2021) (Formerly incarcerated \nindividuals with mental disabilities sufficiently alleged \nstanding to pursue an ADA claim when they alleged that the \ndefendants administer, oversee, and fund the state’s mental \nhealth systems in a manner that resulted in unnecessary \ninstitutionalization.); Murphy by Murphy v. Minn. Dep’t of Hum. \nServs., 260 F. Supp. 3d 1084, 1102 (D. Minn. 2017) (Detailed \nallegations relating to defendants’ role in overseeing the \nadministration of disability services throughout the state \nestablished causation to support standing.). \n- 18 - \nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 72   Filed 03/29/24   Page 18 of 51\n\nc.  Redressability \nAs to the redressability requirement, the law requires that \nit be “likely, as opposed to merely speculative, that the injury \nwill be redressed by a favorable decision” from the \ncourt. Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Env’t Servs. (TOC), \nInc., 528 U.S. 167, 181 (2000). This requirement “examines the \ncausal connection between the alleged injury and the judicial \nrelief requested” and asks whether a judicial decision granting \nthe requested relief will alleviate the plaintiff's alleged \ninjury. Allen v. Wright, 468 U.S. 737, 753 n.19 (1984), \nabrogated on other grounds by Lexmark Int’l, Inc. v. Static \nControl Components, Inc., 572 U.S. 118 (2014). \nPlaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief which \nwould require Defendant to administer its child welfare programs \n“such that it has available a sufficient supply of integrated, \ncommunity-based placements and services to meet the needs of \nchildren with mental impairments in foster care,” and to \n“[i]mplement and sustain an effective system for transitioning \nchildren with mental impairments in foster care out of PRTFs \ninto integrated, community-based placements and services.” \n(Compl. (Doc. 35) at 77.)  Defendant argues that “it is purely \nspeculative whether such broad and vague systemic mandates, even \nif compliant with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(d), would \n- 19 - \nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 72   Filed 03/29/24   Page 19 of 51\n\nredress the alleged injuries of [Named Plaintiffs].” (Def.’s Br. \n(Doc. 41) at 26–27.) Defendant makes four main arguments to this \npoint. \nFirst, Defendant argues that it is speculative whether the \nrequested injunctive relief would benefit the Named Plaintiffs \nindividually because “increasing the supply of mental health \nproviders and families willing to take in children with complex \nand severe mental health needs is a long-term effort that could \nnot be completed before the Named Plaintiffs age out of foster \ncare.” (Def.’s Reply (Doc. 58) at 5.) \nSecond, Defendant argues that even if more community \nplacements and services could be made available overnight, that \nwould not necessarily mean the applicable county DSS or state \ncourt would conclude any of the Named Plaintiffs should be \nplaced in the community. (Def.’s Br. (Doc. 41) at 27.) Defendant \nre-iterates that the final decision for placement resides with \nthe State’s treatment professionals — not Defendant. (Def.’s \nReply (Doc. 58) at 6.) \nThird, Defendant argues this case differs from other class \naction Olmstead cases because here, the “gravamen” of \nPlaintiffs’ Complaint is that “there simply are not enough \nprivate individuals or entities providing” the community-based \nservices and placements that Defendant offers. (Id. at 5.) \n- 20 - \nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 72   Filed 03/29/24   Page 20 of 51\n\nDefendant argues this case differs significantly from other \nclass action Olmstead cases where plaintiffs sought to enjoin a \nspecific policy or action by the state. (Id. at 4–5.) \nFinally, Defendant argues that even if the ADA requires the \nState to increase the supply of community placements, that \nsystemic responsibility lies with North Carolina’s executive \nbranch and legislature and cannot be redressed by the courts. \n(Id. at 7.) \nDefendant’s first argument is not persuasive. Even if Named \nPlaintiffs aged out of foster care by the time any requested \nrelief was implemented, “Article III’s standing requirement \ncenters ‘on whether the party invoking jurisdiction had the \nrequisite stake in the outcome when the suit was filed.’” Edgar \nv. Haines, 2 F.4th 298, 310 (4th Cir. 2021) (quoting Davis v. \nFEC, 554 U.S. 724, 734 (2008)). Moreover, to the extent \nDefendant is raising mootness as a concern, a class action may \nremain live despite the mootness of the claims of the class \nrepresentatives. Pashby v. Delia, 709 F.3d 307, 316 (4th Cir. \n2013) (abrogated on other grounds by Stinnie v. Holcomb, 37 \nF.4th 977 (4th Cir. 2022)) (“If the named plaintiff’s claim is a \nlive controversy at the time of class certification, the case \nwill not become moot even if the named plaintiff’s personal \nclaim later expires.”); Jonathan R. by Dixon v. Justice, 41 \n- 21 - \nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 72   Filed 03/29/24   Page 21 of 51\n\nF.4th 316, 325 (4th Cir. 2022) (“Where a named plaintiff’s \nindividual claim becomes moot before the district court has an \nopportunity to certify the class, the certification may ‘relate \nback’ to the filing of the complaint if other class members \n‘will continue to be subject to the challenged conduct and the \nclaims raised are . . . inherently transitory.’”).   \nDefendant’s second argument fails because at this stage of \nthe proceeding, this court must accept the factual allegations \ncontained in the Complaint as true. Plaintiffs allege “Defendant \nhas created a system where unjustified institutionalization is \noften the only choice, even when community-based placements and \nservices would be more appropriate.” (Pls.’ Resp. (Doc. 22) \nat 26.) Plaintiffs describe a system where children are \nfrequently shuffled through different placements in short \nperiods of time. (See Compl. (Doc. 35) ¶ 66.) For example, Flora \nP. was recently discharged from a PRTF to a Level III group \nhome. (Id.) However, the group home did not have a therapist on \nstaff, and Flora P. was discharged from the group home. (Id.) \nSince then, she has been “moved in and out of a temporary, \nrapid-response family foster home.” (Id.) Additionally, \nPlaintiffs allege that “children involved with the Child Welfare \nsystem sometimes remain in a PRTF long after a discharge plan is \nmade because there is no identified placement available for \n- 22 - \nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 72   Filed 03/29/24   Page 22 of 51\n\nthem.” (Id. ¶ 195.) Named Plaintiffs sufficiently allege that \ncommunity placement is appropriate,5 and, if this court were to \ngrant the relief requested to make more community placements and \nservices available, it is likely Named Plaintiffs would receive \nthose services in the community.6 \nAdditionally, the fact that Named Plaintiffs do not \nspecifically request changes to their individual placements and \nservices does not defeat standing — Plaintiffs “seek systemic \nrelief from injuries resulting from systemic flaws.” Jeremiah M. \nv. Crum, No. 22-cv-00129, 2023 WL 6316631, at *14 (D. Alaska \nSept. 28, 2023) (holding plaintiffs’ Olmstead claims that sought \nsystemic relief in the foster care system were redressable). \nAnd, as discussed above, this systemic relief is likely to \nredress Named Plaintiffs’ injuries. \n \n5 See infra Section IV.B.1. \n6 The court notes Defendant’s Suggestion of Subsequently \nDecided Authority, Haaland v. Brackeen, 599 U.S. 255 (2023). \n(See Doc. 61.) In that case, the Supreme Court held that the \nrelief Plaintiffs sought — an injunction preventing federal \nparties from enforcing the Indian Child Welfare Act’s (“ICWA”) \nplacement preferences — would not remedy the alleged injury \nbecause state courts apply the placement preferences, state \nagencies carry out the court-ordered placements, and state \nofficials who implement ICWA were nonparties who would not be \nbound by a judgment. Id. at 292–93. Haaland is distinguishable \nfrom this case. Plaintiffs seek to enjoin the State’s Department \nof Health and Human Services which oversees and administers the \nState’s child welfare system — not federal officials who have no \nrole in administering or carrying out the mandates imposed on \nthe child welfare system as in Haaland. \n- 23 - \nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 72   Filed 03/29/24   Page 23 of 51\n\n  As to Defendant’s third argument, while it is true that \nsome Olmstead cases are aimed at specific state actions or \nchanges in policies, there have been multiple class action \nOlmstead cases that base their claims on the systemic failure of \nthe state’s child welfare system, as is the case here. For \nexample, in Jonathan R. v. Justice, No. 19-cv-00710, 2023 WL \n184960 (S.D. W. Va. Jan. 13, 2023), the court denied the \ndefendant’s motion to dismiss as to the plaintiffs’ Title II and \nSection 504 claims, which were based on a “structurally inept” \nfoster care system. Id. at 18–20. In that case, the plaintiffs \nalleged the defendant, the State Department of Health and Human \nServices, “failed to create sufficient community or home-based \nmental health services to treat foster children [with mental \nhealth disabilities],” making institutionalization “the only \noption.” Id. at 2. Similar to Plaintiffs here, the plaintiffs in \nJonathan R. requested system-wide injunctive relief “that would \nrequire Defendants to overhaul the West Virginia foster care \nsystem.” Id. at *3.; see also S.R. ex rel. Rosenbauer v. Penn. \nDep’t of Hum. Servs., 309 F. Supp. 3d 250, 254, 266 (M.D. Penn. \n2018) (denying motion to dismiss ADA claims when plaintiffs \nalleged “systemic failures” in the child welfare system and \nsought injunctive relief requiring defendants to “develop a full \narray of appropriate [child welfare] services and placements to \n- 24 - \nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 72   Filed 03/29/24   Page 24 of 51\n\nmeet the needs of children with [mental disabilities] in the \nmost integrated settings appropriate to their needs”). \n  Defendant’s sole remaining argument is that it is not the \ncourt’s role to overhaul North Carolina’s foster care system. \nThis argument implicates many competing concerns, including \ncomity and respect for states and their institutions. However, \nthese concerns and difficulties associated with institution-wide \nreforms do not mean that it is not appropriate for this court to \nconsider such claims at all. See Horne v. Flores, 557 U.S. 433, \n447–49 (2009) (discussing concerns raised by “institutional \nreform litigation”). In fact, the Fourth Circuit recently \nreversed a lower court’s decision to abstain from hearing a \nsimilar Olmstead class action on federalism grounds. See \nJonathan R. v. Justice, 41 F.4th 316, 321 (4th Cir. 2022) (“In \nthis case, principles of federalism not only do not preclude \nfederal intervention, they compel it.”) While Defendants raise a \ncompelling issue — the court’s role, if any, in mandating change \nin the foster care system — this court will “cross the bridge of \nremedies only when the precise contours of the problem have been \nestablished” later in these proceedings. O’Shea v. Littleton, \n414 U.S. 488, 510 (Douglas, J., dissenting).  \n  At least one Named Plaintiff has alleged a legally \ncognizable injury that was caused by Defendant and is likely to \n- 25 - \nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 72   Filed 03/29/24   Page 25 of 51\n\nbe redressed by the requested relief. Thus, this court need not \ndismiss Named Plaintiffs for lack of standing. \n2.  Associational Plaintiffs  \nNext, Defendant argues that the Associational Plaintiffs \nlack standing because the organizations cannot assert standing \nin a representative capacity. (Def.’s Br. (Doc. 41) at 27.) \nAssociational standing is an exception to the general prudential \nrule that a litigant “generally must assert his own legal rights \nand interests, and cannot rest his claim to relief on the legal \nrights or interests of third parties.” Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. \n490, 499 (1975). Under the doctrine of associational standing, \nan association may have standing to sue as the representative of \nits members, even in the absence of injury to itself. Id. \nat 511. To claim associational standing in a representative \ncapacity, an organization must demonstrate that “(a) its members \nwould otherwise have standing to sue in their own right; (b) the \ninterests it seeks to protect are germane to the organization’s \npurpose; and (c) neither the claim asserted nor the relief \nrequested requires the participation of individual members in \nthe lawsuit.” Hunt v. Wash. State Apple Advert. Comm’n, 432 U.S. \n333, 343 (1977) (referred to as the “Hunt test”). \nThe first two elements of the Hunt test represent the \nconstitutional requirements of Article III standing. See United \n- 26 - \nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 72   Filed 03/29/24   Page 26 of 51\n\nFood & Comm. Workers Union Local 751 v. Brown Grp., Inc., 517 \nU.S. 544, 555–56 (1996). The third element is a “judicially \nfashioned and prudentially imposed” general limitation, which \nCongress may remove by statute. Id. at 558. \nDefendant raises two challenges to Associational \nPlaintiffs’ standing.7 First, Defendant argues DRNC’s status as a \nProtection and Advocacy system (“P&A system”), rather than a \ntraditional voluntary membership organization, precludes DRNC \nfrom asserting the claims of the putative class. (Def.’s Br. \n(Doc. 41) at 29.) Second, Defendant argues neither Associational \nPlaintiff can satisfy the third element of the Hunt test because \nthe claim asserted and the relief requested requires \nparticipation of individual members in the lawsuit. (Id.) \na.  P&A Systems’ Standing \nDRNC is designated as the statutorily authorized P&A system \nfor the State of North Carolina, charged with protecting and \nadvocating for the rights of individuals with disabilities. \n(Compl. (Doc. 35) ¶ 27.) As the State’s designated P&A system, \nCongress has granted DRNC the authority to “pursue \nadministrative, legal, and other appropriate remedies to ensure \n \n7 Defendant does not dispute, and this court assumes without \ndeciding, that Plaintiffs have made a facial showing that the \ninterests at stake are germane to each group’s organizational \npurpose. (See Compl. (Doc. 35) at ¶¶ 29, 34.) \n- 27 - \nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 72   Filed 03/29/24   Page 27 of 51\n\nthe protection of individuals with mental illness who are \nreceiving care or treatment in the State.” 42 U.S.C. \n§ 10805(a)(1)(B); (Compl. (Doc. 35) ¶ 31.) “DRNC is accountable \nto members of the disability community.” (Compl. (Doc. 35) \n¶ 31.) \nMore than half of DRNC’s board of directors and advisory \ncouncil  members  are  individuals  with  disabilities  or \nfamily members, guardians, or advocates for individuals \nwith disabilities. DRNC conducts annual surveys of the \ndisability community to determine the specific areas of \nadvocacy on which the organization will focus. Members \nof  the  disability  community  have  the  right  to  file \ngrievances if they disagree with actions taken by DRNC \nor are wrongly denied services by DRNC.  \n \n(Id.) DRNC does not have members in the traditional sense of a \nvoluntary, membership-based organization, but rather represents \nthe interests of its constituents — individuals with mental \nillness who are receiving care or treatment in North Carolina. \n(Compl. (Doc. 35) ¶ 27.) The issue is whether DRNC may borrow \nthe standing of its constituents to bring suit on their behalf. \nIn order to satisfy the first Hunt element, a \nnon-membership organization must show that its constituents \npossess sufficient “indicia of membership” in an organization \nsuch that the organization sufficiently represents those \nconstituents’ interests. Hunt, 432 U.S. at 344. In Hunt, the \nSupreme Court held that the non-membership organization, the \nWashington State Apple Advertising Commission, had associational \n- 28 - \nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 72   Filed 03/29/24   Page 28 of 51\n\nstanding to assert claims on behalf of its constituents when the \nstate’s apple growers and dealers alone elected members of the \nCommission, served on the Commission, and financed its \nactivities. Id. at 344–45. The Court explained, “[i]n a very \nreal sense, therefore, the Commission represents the State’s \ngrowers and dealers and provides the means by which they express \ntheir collective views and protect their collective interests.” \nId. at 345. In deciding whether a non-membership organization \nmay bring a claim on behalf of its constituents, the goal “is to \nensure that the organization claiming associational standing \nactually represents the individual ‘members’ on whose behalf it \npurports to bring suit.” AARP v. U.S. Equal Emp. Opportunity \nComm’n, 226 F. Supp. 3d 7, 16 (D.D.C. 2016). \nThe Fourth Circuit has not ruled on whether a P&A system \nsuch as the DRNC has associational standing to bring claims on \nbehalf of disabled individuals. There is a circuit split on \nwhether P&A systems may assert associational claims on behalf of \ntheir constituents. The Fifth and Eighth Circuit Courts of \nAppeals have denied associational standing to P&A systems, while \nthe Ninth and Eleventh Circuit Courts of Appeals have granted \nassociational standing to P&A systems. \nIn Ass’n for Retarded Citizens v. Dallas County Mental \nHealth & Mental Retardation Center Board of Trustees, 19 F.3d \n- 29 - \nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 72   Filed 03/29/24   Page 29 of 51\n\n241 (5th Cir. 1994), the Fifth Circuit denied associational \nstanding to the federally funded advocacy group because the \norganization “[bore] no relationship to traditional membership \ngroups because most of its ‘clients’ — handicapped and disabled \npeople — [were] unable to participate in and guide the \norganization’s efforts.” Id. at 244. In Missouri Protection & \nAdvocacy Services, Inc. v. Carnahan, 499 F.3d 803 (8th Cir. \n2007), the Eighth Circuit agreed with the Fifth Circuit and held \nthe constituents of the P&A system did not have a sufficiently \nclose relationship to the organization for the organization to \nhave associational standing. Id. at 810.  \nIn Doe v. Stincer, 175 F.3d 879 (11th Cir. 1999), the \nEleventh Circuit held that a P&A system “may sue on behalf of \nits constituents like a more traditional association may sue on \nbehalf of its members” because, like a traditional \nmembership-based organization, the constituents of the advocacy \ngroup “possess the means to influence the priorities and \nactivities” the group undertakes. Id. at 886. Similarly, in \nOregon Advocacy Center v. Mink, 322 F.3d 1101 (9th Cir. 2003), \nthe Ninth Circuit recognized that although the Advocacy Center’s \nconstituents did not have all of the “indicia of membership” \nfound in Hunt because they did not fund the organization, they \nserved on the Advocacy Center’s board and advisory council and \n- 30 - \nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 72   Filed 03/29/24   Page 30 of 51\n\nthus “possess[ed] the means to influence the [organization’s] \npriorities and activities.” Id. at 1112.  \nDistrict courts in North Carolina have held that DRNC may \nassert associational standing on behalf of its constituents. See \nWilson v. Thomas, 43 F. Supp. 3d 628, 632 (E.D.N.C. 2014); \nDisability Rts. N.C. v. N.C. State Bd. of Elections, No. 21-CV-\n361, 2022 WL 2678884, at *2 (E.D.N.C. July 11, 2022); Bone v. \nUniv. of N.C. Health Care Sys., No. 18cv994, 2019 WL 4393531, at \n*10–11 (M.D.N.C. Sept. 13, 2019) (Auld, Mag. J.), R. & R. \nadopted by 2020 WL 1062421 (M.D.N.C. Mar. 5, 2020). \nGiven DRNC’s statutory mandates, and the ability of DRNC’s \nconstituents to influence its priorities and activities, this \ncourt finds that DRNC may sue on behalf of its constituents as a \ntraditional membership organization may. See Disability Rts. \nN.Y. v. N.Y. State, No. 17-cv-6965, 2024 WL 20753, at *5–12 \n(E.D.N.Y. Jan. 2, 2024) (providing an overview of associational \nstanding and P&A systems); see also Disability Rts. Pa. v. Pa. \nDep’t of Hum. Servs., No. 19-CV-737, 2020 WL 1491186, at *8 n.6 \n(M.D. Pa. Mar. 27, 2020) (collecting cases that have concluded \nP&A systems have associational standing). \nAs explained supra Section III.B.1, at least one Named \nPlaintiff has standing and is a constituent of DRNC. \nAdditionally, this court found that at least London R. has \n- 31 - \nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 72   Filed 03/29/24   Page 31 of 51\n\nstanding, who is a youth member of the NC NAACP. (Compl. \n(Doc. 35) ¶ 112.) Thus, constituents of DRNC or members of NC \nNAACP would otherwise have standing to sue in their own right, \nsatisfying the first element of the Hunt test.  \nb.  Nature of the Claim and Relief Requested \nDefendant also argues that neither Associational Plaintiff \ncan satisfy the third Hunt element because the injunctive relief \nsought would require a fact-intensive inquiry into \nindividualized situations. \nThe third Hunt requirement — that neither the claim \nasserted nor the relief requested requires participation of \nindividual members in the lawsuit — is a prudential requirement \nthat “is best seen as focusing on . . . matters of \nadministrative convenience and efficiency.” United Food, 517 \nU.S. at 557. The third Hunt requirement is meant to reflect the \n“background presumption” that “litigants may not assert the \nrights of absent third parties.” Id. (emphasis added). The \njudicially imposed rule is meant to promote adversarial \nintensity and guard against the hazard associated with \nlitigating damages claims on a representational basis. Id.  \nWhen Congress has authorized an organization to sue on its \nmembers behalf, and “the only impediment to that suit is a \ngeneral limitation, judicially fashioned and prudentially \n- 32 - \nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 72   Filed 03/29/24   Page 32 of 51\n\nimposed, there is no question that Congress may abrogate the \nimpediment.” Id. at 558. The parties did not address the issue \nof whether DRNC must satisfy the third requirement of Hunt, or \nwhether it has been abrogated by Congress. \nCongress has granted DRNC the authority to “pursue \nadministrative, legal, and other appropriate remedies to ensure \nthe protection of individuals with mental illness who are \nreceiving care or treatment in the State.” 42 U.S.C. § 10805; \n(Compl. (Doc. 35) ¶ 27.) Although the Fourth Circuit has not \nruled on the issue, district courts and the Ninth Circuit have \nheld that Congress abrogated the third Hunt prudential \nrequirement for P&A systems by authorizing them to pursue legal \nremedies to protect individuals with mental disabilities. See \nOr. Advoc. Ctr., 322 F.3d at 1113; Tellis v. LeBlanc, No. 18-cv-\n0541, 2019 WL 1474777, at *4 (W.D. La. Apr. 3, 2019) (collecting \ncases); see also Trivette v. Tenn. Dep’t of Corr., No. 20-cv-\n00276, 2020 WL 6685557, at *6 n.6 (M.D. Tenn. Nov. 12, 2020) \n(stating the third Hunt element “arguably should not apply to a \nP&A organization at all”). \nThis court agrees that Congress has abrogated the third \nHunt requirement as it applies to DRNC in this context, thus \nDRNC may assert associational standing on behalf of Named \nPlaintiffs. However, even if this court is mistaken in its \n- 33 - \nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 72   Filed 03/29/24   Page 33 of 51\n\nanalysis of Congressional abrogation, because this court \nconcludes that the nature of the claim and the relief requested \ndo not require individual participation of members, as explained \nbelow, DRNC may assert associational standing.   \nGenerally speaking, the third element of Hunt is satisfied \nwhen an association seeks injunctive or declaratory relief as \nopposed to monetary damages. See Retail Industry Leaders Ass’n \nv. Fielder, 475 F.3d 180, 187 (4th Cir. 2007) (“Unlike a suit \nfor money damages, which would require examination of each \nmember's unique injury, this action seeks a declaratory judgment \nand injunctive relief, the type of relief for which \nassociational standing was originally recognized.”); Students \nfor Fair Admissions, Inc. v. Univ. of North Carolina, No. \n14CV954, 2018 WL 4688388, at *6 (M.D.N.C. Sept. 29, 2018). But \nsee New Hampshire Motor Transport Ass’n v. Rowe, 448 F.3d 66, 72 \n(1st Cir. 2006), aff'd, 552 U.S. 364, 128 S. Ct. 989, 169 L. Ed. \n2d 933 (2008) (clarifying that injunctive relief will not \nsatisfy Hunt's third prong where adjudication of the claim \nrequires the court to engage in a “sufficiently fact-intensive \ninquiry”). \nDefendant relies on Parent/Professional Advocacy League v. \nCity of Springfield, 934 F.3d 13 (1st. Cir. 2019), in support of \nits position that the nature of the claim and the relief sought \n- 34 - \nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 72   Filed 03/29/24   Page 34 of 51\n\nhere is inherently individualized and thus the Associational \nPlaintiffs do not have representative standing. (See Doc. 41 \n(Def.’s Br.) at 28.) \nIn Parent/Professional Advocacy League, a proposed class of \nplaintiffs alleged that the school district discriminated \nagainst students with mental health disabilities by segregating \nthem in separate and inferior schools. 934 F.3d at 17. The First \nCircuit found that although the complaint facially brought an \nADA claim, “the crux of the complaint [was] that the defendants \nfailed to provide the educational instruction and related \nservices that the class plaintiffs need to access an appropriate \neducation in an appropriate environment,” in violation of the \nIndividuals with Disabilities Education Act (“IDEA”). Id. at 25. \nIn essence, the suit was “challenging hundreds of individualized \ndecisions made in a decentralized environment.” Id. at 29. \nThe First Circuit held that the associational plaintiffs \nlacked standing because the “adjudication of the claims . . . \nwould turn on facts specific to each student, including unique \nfeatures of each student’s unique disability, needs, services, \nand placement.” Id. at 35. The court also denied the plaintiffs’ \nmotion for class certification for failure to satisfy \ncommonality. Id. at 28. The court reasoned the “plaintiffs’ \nclaims are not ‘systemic’” . . . “[a] finding that one student \n- 35 - \nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 72   Filed 03/29/24   Page 35 of 51\n\nwith a certain type and degree of mental health disability \nshould have been mainstreamed would not mean that another \nstudent with a different type, or even just a different degree, \nof mental health disability should have received the same \nservices or been mainstreamed.” Id. at 27–28. \nParent/Professional Advocacy League is distinguishable from \nthe case here because Plaintiffs are not bringing a claim under \nthe IDEA, which is inherently individualized. The IDEA requires \nthe delivery of certain services “in conformity with the \n[student’s] individualized education program.” Id. at 19 \n(quoting 20 U.S.C. § 1401(9)(D)). Here, Plaintiffs are not \nchallenging their individual placement decisions or asking this \ncourt to make findings about what specific services an \nindividual in the child welfare system may require. (See Pls.’ \nResp. (Doc. 53) at 26–27.) Plaintiffs’ claims are based on the \nallegation that children with disabilities are generally \neligible to receive community-based services yet are \nsystemically institutionalized. (See generally Compl. \n(Doc. 35.).) The issue of whether Plaintiffs satisfy the \ncommunity requirement must be determined at the class \ncertification stage. \nHere, the nature of the claim and the relief requested do \nnot require individual participation of members. See Joseph S. \n- 36 - \nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 72   Filed 03/29/24   Page 36 of 51\n\nv. Hogan, 561 F. Supp. 2d 280, 308 (E.D.N.Y. 2008) (“Plaintiffs \ndo not contend that any individual plaintiff . . . is entitled \nto a court order placing him or her in a community-based \ntreatment program; rather, they allege that defendants have \ndiscriminatory policies and practices that unnecessarily place \nindividuals with mental illness in nursing homes as a matter of \nroutine, and without first conducting legally required \nassessments. Thus, the focus of plaintiffs' proof will be on \ndefendants' actions.”); Ball v. Kasich, 244 F. Supp. 3d 662, \n(S.D. Ohio 2017) (holding organization had associational \nstanding to bring Olmstead claim on behalf of its constituents). \nThe fact that “litigation will require evidence and testimony \nfrom a representative sample of [individuals]” will not defeat \nassociational standing. Allen v. City, No. 20-cv-998, 2021 WL \n2223772, at *5 (M.D.N.C. June 2, 2021). “[I]ndividual \nparticipation of each injured party” is not necessary here. \nWarth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 511 (1975) (emphasis added).  \nDNRC and NC NAACP have facially alleged associational \nstanding to pursue the claims of their constituents in a \nrepresentative capacity. At this stage in the litigation, taking \nthe facts as alleged by Plaintiffs as true, Defendant’s motion \nto dismiss for lack of standing and subject matter jurisdiction \nwill be denied. \n- 37 - \nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 72   Filed 03/29/24   Page 37 of 51\n\nIV.  MOTION TO DISMISS FOR FAILURE TO STATE A CLAIM \nDefendant also moves to dismiss Plaintiffs’ Complaint under \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), arguing Plaintiffs \nhave failed to state a claim. (Def.’s Mot. (Doc. 40) at 1.) \nA.    Standard of Review \n“To survive a [Rule 12(b)(6)] motion to dismiss, a \ncomplaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as \ntrue, to ‘state a claim to relief that is plausible on its \nface.’” Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (quoting \nBell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007)). In other \nwords, the plaintiff must plead facts that “allow[] the court to \ndraw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable” and \nmust demonstrate “more than a sheer possibility that a defendant \nhas acted unlawfully.” Id. (citing Twombly, 550 U.S. at 556–57). \nThe factual allegations must be sufficient to “raise a right to \nrelief above the speculative level” so as to “nudge[] the[] \nclaims across the line from conceivable to plausible.” Twombly, \n550 U.S. at 555, 570; see also Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 680; Francis \nv. Giacomelli, 588 F.3d 186, 193 (4th Cir. 2009) (applying the \nTwombly/Iqbal standard to evaluate the legal sufficiency of \npleadings). When ruling on a motion to dismiss, a court must \naccept the complaint’s well-pleaded factual allegations as true \nand view the complaint in the light most favorable to the \n- 38 - \nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 72   Filed 03/29/24   Page 38 of 51\n\nplaintiff.  Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 676—79. However, “[t]hreadbare \nrecitals of the elements of a cause of action, supported by mere \nconclusory statements, do not suffice.” Id. at 678. \nB.  Analysis  \nTitle II of the ADA provides that “no qualified individual \nwith a disability shall, by reason of such disability, be \nexcluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the \nservices, programs, or activities of a public entity, or be \nsubjected to discrimination by any such entity.” 42 U.S.C. \n§ 12132. The ADA’s implementing regulations require public \nentities to “administer services, programs, and activities in \nthe most integrated setting appropriate to the needs of \nqualified individuals with disabilities.” 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(d).  \nThe Supreme Court addressed the integration mandate in \nOlmstead v. L.C. ex. rel. Zimring, 527 U.S. 581 (1999), holding \nthat unjustified institutional isolation of persons with \ndisabilities is a form of unlawful discrimination based on \ndisability. Id. at 600. Under Olmstead, community placement is \nrequired when: (1) “the State’s treatment professionals have \ndetermined that community placement is appropriate;” (2) “the \ntransfer from institutional care to a less restrictive setting \nis not opposed by the affected individual;” and (3) “the \nplacement can be reasonably accommodated, taking into account \n- 39 - \nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 72   Filed 03/29/24   Page 39 of 51\n\nthe resources available to the State and the needs of others \nwith mental disabilities.” Id. at 587. Here, Plaintiffs allege \nfacts to sufficiently state an Olmstead claim. \n1.    Community Placement is Appropriate \nDefendant argues that this court should dismiss Plaintiffs’ \nclaims because four of the five Named Plaintiffs (Timothy B., \nIsabella A., Flora B., and Steph C.) do not allege that their \nplacement was inconsistent with the recommendations of the \nState’s treatment professionals. (Def.’s Br. (Doc. 41) at 15.)8 \nSpecifically, Defendant argues state treatment professionals \ndetermined PRTF placement was “medically necessary” for \nPlaintiffs Timothy B. and Isabella A., and Plaintiffs Flora B. \nand Steph C. were moved out of PRTFs to a lower-level \nresidential treatment program (Level III placements) based on \nthe recommendations of treatment professionals. (Id. at 17.)  \nWhile Olmstead involved a case where the state’s treatment \nprofessionals determined community placement was appropriate, \nlater decisions by lower courts have concluded that such a \n \n8 Defendant also argues London R. cannot state a claim \nbecause she was only temporarily placed in a PRTF to receive \ntreatment while awaiting community placement, and, under these \ncircumstances, “it is reasonable for the State to ask someone to \nwait until a community placement is available.” (Def.’s Br. \n(Doc. 41) at 17–18.) This argument goes whether placement can be \nreasonably accommodated and will be addressed infra Section \nIV.B.3. \n \n- 40 - \nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 72   Filed 03/29/24   Page 40 of 51\n\nfinding is not required to state a claim. See M.J. v. District \nof Columbia, 401 F. Supp. 3d 1, 12–13 (D.D.C. 2019); Day v. \nDistrict of Columbia, 894 F. Supp. 2d 1, 23 (D.D.C. 2012) \n(collecting cases of lower courts that have rejected the \nargument that Olmstead requires an allegation that the State \nrecommend community placement to state a claim). \nThis court agrees with those courts on the facts alleged \nhere and concludes the allegations are sufficient to plausibly \nstate a claim. Plaintiffs allege that community-based placement \nis appropriate for each Named Plaintiff, (Compl. (Doc. 35) \n¶¶ 52, 69, 86, 104, 123), and includes sufficient factual detail \nto support this allegation at the motion to dismiss stage. For \nexample, the Complaint alleges: “The PRTF has repeatedly talked \nwith Timothy B. about transitioning him to a lower level of \ncare,” (id. ¶ 54); “Flora B. was recommended for a Level III \nGroup Home placement . . .  ,” (id. ¶ 70); “[Isabella A.] was \npreviously placed in several community-based TFC homes,” (id. \n¶ 86); “Steph C. has previously lived in several different \ncommunity-based placements with community-based treatment,” (id. \n¶ 106); and “London R.’s treatment providers first recommended \nshe be placed in Intensive Alternative Family Treatment (IATF) \nfoster care, a North Carolina community-based therapeutic foster \ncare program,” (id. ¶ 123). These factual allegations are \n- 41 - \nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 72   Filed 03/29/24   Page 41 of 51\n\nconsistent with Plaintiffs’ claims that Plaintiffs are \nfrequently institutionalized not because it is required or \nappropriate, but because of a lack of community-based \nalternatives. These factual allegations are sufficient to allege \nthat community-based placement is appropriate for Named \nPlaintiffs.9 \nDefendant additionally argues that Named Plaintiffs Flora \nB. and Steph C. fail to state a claim because they have been \nmoved from their PRTFs to lower-level treatment residential \nprograms at the recommendation of state treatment professionals. \n(Def.’s Br. (Doc. 41) at 17.) Plaintiffs respond that Flora B. \nand Steph C. remain at serious risk of re-institutionalization, \nwhich is sufficient to state a claim under Olmstead. (Pls.’ \nResp. (Doc. 53) at 21 n.2.) \nThe Fourth Circuit has held that Olmstead extends to those \nat serious risk of institutionalization. Pashby v. Delia, 709 \n \n9 “At a later stage, Plaintiffs will be required to provide \nevidence to back up their claims” that community-based placement \nand treatment is appropriate, but not at the motion to dismiss \nstage. See M.J. v. District of Columbia, 401 F. Supp. 3d 1, 13 \n(D.D.C. 2019). \n- 42 - \nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 72   Filed 03/29/24   Page 42 of 51\n\nF.3d 307 (4th Cir. 2013).10 After this motion to dismiss was \nfiled, Defendant filed a suggestion of subsequently decided \nauthority — United States v. Mississippi, 82 F.4th 387 (5th Cir. \n2023). In that case, the Fifth Circuit, looking at the plain \ntext of Title II and the integration mandate, held that Olmstead \ndoes not extend to those merely at risk of institutionalization. \nId. at 392. Following a bench trial, the district court had \nfound that the State’s mental health system violated Title II of \nthe ADA and issued a remedial injunctive order. Id. at 390. The \nFifth Circuit reversed, holding that Olmstead does not supply a \n“basis for an at-risk claim like that litigated en masse in this \ncase,” when “not one individual’s treating physician testified \nabout the ‘justifiability’ of that person’s past \ninstitutionalization, much less a ‘risk’ that the person would \nbe ‘unjustifiably institutionalized’ in the future.” Id. at 394. \nThe Fifth Circuit explained that an “Olmstead case turns on \nactual ‘unjustifiable institutionalization,’ not on hypothetical \nfuture events.” Id.  \n \n10 Pashby is consistent with other Circuit court holdings. \nSee Davis v. Shah, 821 F.3d 231 (2d Cir. 2016); Waskul v. \nWashtenaw Cnty. Cmty. Mental Health, 979 F.3d 426 (6th Cir. \n2020); Steimel v. Wernert, 823 F.3d 902 (7th Cir. 2016); M.R. v. \nDreyfus, 697 F.3d 706 (9th Cir. 2012); Fisher v. Okla. Health \nCare Auth., 335 F.3d 1175 (10th Cir. 2003). But see United \nStates v. Mississippi, 82 F.4th 387 (5th Cir. 2023). \n- 43 - \nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 72   Filed 03/29/24   Page 43 of 51\n\nUnited States v. Mississippi is distinguishable from the \ncase here.11 At this stage, the court must accept the facts \nalleged by Plaintiffs as true. Timothy B., Isabella A., and \nLondon R. are all currently unnecessarily institutionalized. \n(Compl. (Doc. 35 ¶¶ 41, 75, 111.) At the time Plaintiffs filed \ntheir original Complaint, Flora P. and Steph C. were also \ninstitutionalized, but they have since been discharged. (See \nPls.’ Resp. (Doc. 53) at 21 n.2.) Although community-based \nplacement is appropriate for Flora P. and Steph C., they have \nbeen unable to secure a stable, long-term placement in the \ncommunity, putting them at serious risk of re-\ninstitutionalization. (Compl. (Doc. 35) ¶ 66, 109.) Considering \nthe facts as alleged by the Plaintiff, unjustified \ninstitutionalization is not a “hypothetical future event” for \nFlora P. and Steph C.  \n \n11 In United States v. Mississippi, the Fifth Circuit also \nstated decisions, including Pashby, holding that a plaintiff at \nserious risk of institutionalization may bring an Olmstead \nclaim, was superseded by the United States Supreme Court \ndecision, Kisor v. Wilkie, 588 U.S. --, 139 S. Ct. 2404 (2019). \nMississippi, 82 F.4th at394. Kisor narrowed the circumstances \nunder which a court may afford Auer deference to an agency’s \ninterpretation of its own regulation, clarifying that “the \npossibility of deference can arise only if a regulation is \ngenuinely ambiguous.” 139 S. Ct. at 2414. Although United States \nv. Mississippi was decided after Defendant filed its motion, \nKisor was decided in June 2019. Neither party addressed how \nKisor may affect Pashby’s holding, and it appears no district \ncourt in the Fourth Circuit has addressed the issue. This court \nmay address this potential issue at a later time if necessary. \n- 44 - \nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 72   Filed 03/29/24   Page 44 of 51\n\nThus, this court will not decline to consider Flora P.’s \nand Steph C.’s claims on the basis that they are not currently \ninstitutionalized. See Jeremiah M. v. Crum, No. 22-cv-129, 2023 \nWL 6316631, at *26 n.318 (D. Alaska Sept. 28, 2023) (noting \ndefendant's Notice of Supplemental Authority, United States v. \nMississippi, 82 F.4th 387 (5th Cir. 2023), but finding “no \nreason to deviate from Ninth Circuit precedent.”). \nIn sum, Plaintiffs are not required to allege that the \nState’s treatment professionals have recommended community-based \nplacement to state an Olmstead claim. Furthermore, the fact that \nsome plaintiffs are not currently institutionalized will not \ndefeat their claims when those plaintiffs are at serious risk of \nre-institutionalization. Accordingly, Plaintiffs allege facts to \nsatisfy the first element of an Olmstead claim.  \n2.  Plaintiffs Do Not Oppose Community-Based \nPlacement \nDefendant argues that Plaintiffs fail to allege that the \nparents, guardians, or custodians of Named Plaintiffs have \nchosen community-based treatment and thus fail to state a claim \nunder Olmstead. (Def.’s Br. (Doc. 41) at 18.) Defendant argues \nthat under state law, the choice as to the mental health \nservices to be provided to minors, and the preferred setting for \nthose services, is exercised on behalf of the children either by \n- 45 - \nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 72   Filed 03/29/24   Page 45 of 51\n\ntheir natural parents or guardian, by DSS, or pursuant to a \ncourt order. (Id. at 18–21.) Defendant further argues that \n“there are multiple checkpoints to ensure that the minor is \nreceiving services appropriate to their level of need,” \nincluding mandated judicial review of all voluntary placements \nof any minor in a PRTF. (Id. at 20–21.) \nOlmstead only requires that plaintiffs do not oppose \nreceiving community-based services. 527 U.S. at 607. Here, each \nNamed Plaintiff clearly alleges that they in fact desire \ncommunity-based treatment. (See Doc. 35 ¶¶ 58, 71, 88, 107, \n125.) As Plaintiffs explain, a minor is not required to allege \nthat their custodian requested community placement or treatment \nto state a claim under Olmstead, only that “the transfer from \ninstitutional care to a less restrictive setting is not opposed \nby the affected individual.” Olmstead, 527 U.S. at 587. Thus, \nPlaintiffs allege facts to satisfy the second element of an \nOlmstead claim.  \n3.  Reasonable Accommodation \nFinally, Plaintiffs allege facts to satisfy the third \nelement of an Olmstead claim — that community placement and \ntreatment can be reasonably accommodated. The third Olmstead \nelement stems from the regulation that public entities must make \n“reasonable modifications in policies, practices, or procedures \n- 46 - \nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 72   Filed 03/29/24   Page 46 of 51\n\nwhen the modifications are necessary to avoid discrimination on \nthe basis of disability.” 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(7)(i). However, \nmodifications are not required if “the public entity can \ndemonstrate that making the modifications would fundamentally \nalter the nature of the service, program, or activity.” Id. \nThus, as the plurality in Olmstead explained, “the \nreasonable-modifications regulation speaks of ‘reasonable \nmodifications’ to avoid discrimination, and allows States to \nresist modifications that entail a ‘fundamenta[l] alter[ation]’ \nof the States’ services and programs.” Olmstead, 527 U.S. at \n603. In other words, Olmstead does not require states to create \nnew programs or provide a certain base-line level of benefits. \n527 U.S. at 612 (Kennedy, J., concurring). However, with regard \nto the services they in fact provide, such as the child welfare \nsystem or community treatment, the State “must make reasonable \nmodifications so that Plaintiffs can fully participate in” those \nservices. Jonathan R. v. Justice, No. 19-cv-710, 2023 WL 184960, \n*19 (S.D. W. Va. Jan. 13, 2023). In evaluating a State’s \nfundamental-alteration defense, the court must consider the \nresources available to the State, the cost of providing \ncommunity-based services, the range of services the State \nprovides others with mental disabilities and the State’s \n- 47 - \nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 72   Filed 03/29/24   Page 47 of 51\n\nobligation to provide such services equitably. Olmstead, 527 \nU.S. at 597.  \nHere, Plaintiffs allege community-based placements and \nservices yield better outcomes and are less costly to provide. \n(Compl. (Doc. 35) ¶¶ 2, 13, 15–16.) They also allege waitlists \npose a barrier to receiving community-based services. (Id. \n¶¶ 14, 260.)  \nDefendant argues that Olmstead does not require the State \nto expand community programs that are operating at capacity and \nmay, consistent with the ADA, maintain a “waiting list” that \n“moves at a reasonable pace not controlled by the State’s \nendeavors to keep its institutions fully populated.” (Def.’s \nReply (Doc. 58) at 10.) Specifically, Defendant argues London R. \nfails to state a claim because she was only temporarily placed \nin a PRTF to receive treatment while awaiting community \nplacement. (Def.’s Br. (Doc. 41) at 17–18.) Plaintiffs allege \nLondon R.’s placement “was intended only as a short-term, \nemergency placement,” but she “has languished at this PRTF for \nnearly four months and remains there today.” (Compl. (Doc. 35) \n¶ 117.) \nThe plurality in Olmstead recognized that “[i]f, for \nexample, the State were to demonstrate that it had a \ncomprehensive, effectively working plan for placing qualified \n- 48 - \nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 72   Filed 03/29/24   Page 48 of 51\n\npersons with mental disabilities in less restrictive settings, \nand a waiting list that moved at a reasonable pace not \ncontrolled by the State's endeavors to keep its institutions \nfully populated, the reasonable-modifications standard would be \nmet.” 527 U.S. at 605–06. However, whether Defendant has an \neffectively working plan, including a waiting list that moves at \na reasonable pace, is a fact-specific inquiry not appropriate \nfor determination at the motion to dismiss stage. See \nGuggenberger v. Minnesota, 198 F. Supp. 3d 973, 1030–31 (D. \nMinn. 2016). Defendant cites cases in support of its argument \nwhere the court found that the fundamental alteration defense \napplied at the summary judgment stage or in an order following \ntrial. See Arc of Wash. State Inc. v. Braddock, 427 F.3d 615, \n622 (9th Cir. 2005) (summary judgment); Sanchez v. Johnson, 416 \nF.3d 1051, 1068 (9th Cir. 2005) (summary judgment); Bryson v. \nStephen, No. 99–CV–558, 2006 WL 2805238, at *9 (D.N.H. Sept. 29, \n2006) (order following trial). This issue must be resolved at a \nlater stage of the proceedings. \nPlaintiffs have sufficiently pled facts to allege a \ndiscrimination claim under Olmstead, thus Defendant’s motion to \ndismiss for failure to state a claim will be denied. \n- 49 - \nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 72   Filed 03/29/24   Page 49 of 51\n\nV.  ISSUE PRECLUSION \nLast, Defendant argues that Plaintiffs’ claims are barred \nby claim and issue preclusion. (Def.’s Br. (Doc. 41) at 21–23.) \nDefendant states  \nstate law requires that every child who is admitted \nto  a  PRTF  have  a  hearing  in  state  court  in  the \ndistrict in which the PRTF is located to determine if \nthere  is  “clear,  cogent,  and  convincing  evidence” \nthat the minor is mentally ill or a substance abuser, \nin need of further treatment at a 24-hour facility, \nand  that  less  restrictive  measures  will  be \ninsufficient.  \n \n(Id. at 22.) Defendant argues these state court hearings, known \nas Chapter 122C proceedings, provide Plaintiffs a “‘full and \nfair opportunity’ to litigate whether their admission to PRTF \nwas necessary or whether a less restrictive option was \nsufficient,” and thus should be barred from re-litigating that \nissue in federal court. (Id. at 23.) \nPlaintiffs respond that the issues in this case are \ndistinct from the issues necessary to the disposition of North \nCarolina’s Chapter 122C proceedings. (Pls.’ Resp. (Doc. 53) \nat 44–45.) Chapter 122C proceedings only consider placement \noptions currently available. See In re M.B., 240 N.C. App. 140, \n156, 771 S.E.2d 615, 626 (2015) (“Chapter 122C makes clear our \nGeneral Assembly’s intent to provide ‘within available \nresources’ mental health services that are ‘designed to meet the \nneeds of clients in the least restrictive, therapeutically most \n- 50 - \nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 72   Filed 03/29/24   Page 50 of 51\n\nappropriate setting available.’”). Plaintiffs’ claims are based \non Defendant’s systemic failures to provide an adequate supply \nof community-based services to children in foster care who would \notherwise qualify for such services. Any state court proceeding \ndetermining that placement in a PRTF was the most appropriate \nplacement available at the time does not preclude this current \naction. See Jonathan R. v. Justice, No. 19-cv-710, 2023 WL \n184960, at *20 (S.D.W. Va. Jan. 13, 2023) (“Defendants have \nsimply failed to create in-home and community-based treatment \nsettings. Thus, when placing Plaintiffs, state courts had no \nchoice but to institutionalize them. To the extent Defendants \nthink these placements were in any way ‘justified’ \nunder Olmstead, they are wrong.”). \nVI.  CONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that \nDefendant’s Motion to Dismiss, (Doc. 40), is DENIED. \nThis the 29th day of March, 2024. \n \n \n          __________________________________ \n             United States District Judge   \n- 51 - \nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 72   Filed 03/29/24   Page 51 of 51",

This action seeks to end ongoing discrimination by the North Carolina \nDepartment of Health and Human Services (“DHHS”) against children with disabilities \nplaced in child welfare custody (“foster care”) who are unnecessarily segregated from \n1\nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 35   Filed 03/06/23   Page 1 of 79\n\ntheir home communities and routinely isolated in heavily restrictive, and often clinically \ninappropriate, institutional placements known as psychiatric residential treatment \nfacilities (“PRTFs”).    \n2. On any given day, hundreds of children with disabilities in DHHS custody \nremain confined inside PRTFs, away from their communities. A material percentage of \nthese children would be better – and far more cost-effectively – supported with integrated \ncommunity-based and family-based placements (housing) and services, including mental \nand behavioral health services.   \n3. DHHS can support clinically appropriate, less restrictive placements, but \nnonetheless spends excessive resources isolating children with disabilities in PRTFs. This \nexact practice was recently called out by a state representative who stated: “[North \nCarolina] [is] ruining people’s live, and we’re doing it in the most expensive way \npossible . . . . It’s inhumane and irresponsible. It is a government failure.” \n4. PRTFs are designed to provide intensive, short-term, residential psychiatric \ntreatment for temporary stabilization. They are generally unsuitable as a long-term “place \nto live,” but that does not stop DHHS from allowing children to languish there for \nextended periods of time. Unsurprisingly, research shows that children with disabilities \nconfined to PRTFs suffer much worse outcomes than non-institutionalized children. \nThese outcomes include spending longer periods of time in child welfare custody without \na permanent home; losing critical family connections with parents, siblings, and extended \nfamily due to their confinement; and experiencing higher rates of maltreatment while in \nchild welfare custody.  \n2\nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 35   Filed 03/06/23   Page 2 of 79\n\n5. Moreover, children with disabilities in foster care regularly face trauma \nwithin PRTFs. They are often confined to prison-like settings under the care of a poorly \ntrained and understaffed workforce, where they are subject to broken bones, sprains, \nbruises, and dangerous physical and chemical restraints; withstand sexual and physical \nabuse, bullying, and hate speech by both youth and staff; and face mental health \ndeterioration and cocktails of strong psychotropic medications. For instance, the Named \nPlaintiff children in this litigation, referred to by the pseudonyms Timothy B., Flora P., \nIsabella A., Steph C., and London R., are all receiving heavy cocktails of mind-altering \npsychotropic medicationswhile at North Carolina PRTFs. Flora P., Isabella A., and Steph \nC. have been subject to physical restraints; Timothy B. has faced bullying by staff; \nIsabella A. has been the target of bullying and sexual harassment; and Steph C. has been \nairlifted to a hospital after a physical attack knocked him unconscious. Despite these \nknown dangerous conditions, DHHS sent at least 572 children in foster care to PRTFs in \nfiscal year 2020 to 2021.   \n6. Children of color, such as Named Plaintiffs Flora P., Steph C., and London \nR., bear the brunt of these harms. Black and Brown children are disproportionately \nrepresented in DHHS’s foster care system in the first instance. And once in the system, \nBlack and Brown children with disabilities are disproportionately confined to PRTFs. \nAccording to DHHS data from fiscal year 2019 to 2020, Black and Brown (including \nmultiracial) children make up more than 40% of the children on Medicaid confined to \nPRTFs. When you include children identified as “other,” that number jumps to almost \n50%. \n3\nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 35   Filed 03/06/23   Page 3 of 79\n\n7. DHHS has long been aware of the intolerable conditions and other harms \nthat children face within PRTFs. DHHS conducts regular oversight and monitoring of \nPRTFs and catalogues in public reports the substantial abuse and neglect occurring there. \nYet DHHS keeps spending millions of taxpayer dollars to send children in child welfare \ncustody to PRTFs, the very children they are in charge of protecting.   \n8. Not only are children in foster care in North Carolina routinely sent to \nPRTFs unnecessarily, more than a third of those children are sent into PRTFs out of state. \nDHHS ships children of all ages as far away as Utah, Missouri, and Indiana – too far for \ntheir caseworkers to keep an eye on their safety or for their families to visit them.   \n9. Overwhelmingly, the children DHHS warehouses in PRTFs would be better \nserved by community placements and, in many instances, should never have been placed \nin a PRTF at all. They can – and should – be living within and treated within their \ncommunities, in family or family-like homes, near their schools and service providers. \n10. A recent USA Today investigation uncovered that North Carolina children \nin foster care “were confined to [lockdown psychiatric] facilities round-the-clock despite \na clinician determining that it was not medically justified, according to a consultant \ndocument and interviews . . . [because] there was nowhere else to put the youngsters. So \nthey locked them away in institutions with strip searches and limited academic \nprograms,” a common “practice [that is] a consequence of the failures in North Carolina’s \nfoster care system.” \n11. North Carolina child welfare administrators admitted to USA Today, while \nmaintaining anonymity for fear of retribution, that a major reason to unnecessarily place \n4\nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 35   Filed 03/06/23   Page 4 of 79\n\nchildren in PRTFs is the lack of available family settings to care for them. “County social \nservice offices have paid to send children to psychiatric residential treatment facilities — \nan option that is supposed to be reserved for kids with severe mental and behavioral \nproblems — even when clinicians recommended against such therapy, they said.” \n12. DHHS’s unnecessary institutionalization of children with disabilities is \nexactly the sort of unlawful discrimination prohibited by Title II of the Americans with \nDisabilities Act under the Supreme Court’s landmark Olmstead decision, as well as by \nSection 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. See Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581 \n(1999). DHHS is legally obligated to administer its services, programs, and activities to \nchildren with disabilities in the most integrated setting appropriate to their needs, 28 \nC.F.R § 35.130(d), and is prohibited from unjustifiably institutionalizing and segregating \nchildren in PRTFs. See Olmstead, 527 U.S. at 587.  \n13. DHHS’s failure to provide community-based placement and treatment \noptions for children and youth with disabilities in foster care fuels its overreliance on \nPRTFs. Despite a cost of $100 million per year, DHHS has increased its reliance on \npsychiatric residential treatment facilities since 2010 – instead of building up and \nexpanding appropriate community-based family placements (relative or kinship families \nand non-relative foster families) and supportive mental and behavioral health treatment \nservices.   \n14. While DHHS ostensibly offers an array of community-based placements \nand services, the availability of needed services is too limited, and DHHS does not ensure \nthat children with disabilities in foster care can actually access existing services. For \n5\nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 35   Filed 03/06/23   Page 5 of 79\n\ninstance, DHHS acknowledges the significant barriers to accessing services in North \nCarolina, such as shortages or waitlists for intensive in-home services, crisis intervention \nservices, outpatient mental health and substance abuse services, and inadequate \ntransportation to and from such services. In light of their insufficient community-based \noptions, DHHS unnecessarily sends foster children to PRTFs to languish there for \nextended periods of time, and cycles children in and out of PRTFs – when DHHS should \nonly use PRTFs in rare situations as short-term treatment and never as a place to live \nbecause it has nowhere else to put them.   \n15. The DHHS failure to expand its community-based placements and services \nfor foster children and youth with disabilities is particularly confounding and disturbing \nbecause it is well-established that community-based placements are more effective, yield \nbetter outcomes for children, and are less costly. \n16. According to a consultant hired by DHHS in 2020, “North Carolina spends \na disproportionate amount of its resources on institutional and congregate care settings” \nand “spends more to serve individuals in congregate care settings than it spends on \ncommunity-integrated service options.” Use of community-based placements and \nservices would alleviate the profound waste of North Carolina tax payer funds on harmful \ninstitutional settings that cost at least hundreds of dollars a day. \n17. The DHHS placement and services crisis for children is so dire that it was \nreported in September of 2022 that local Division of Social Services (“DSS”) offices, \nagents of DHHS, are “boarding children in their offices or leaving children with \nemotional and behavioral health needs in emergency rooms after hospitals have released \n6\nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 35   Filed 03/06/23   Page 6 of 79\n\nthem because there was nowhere else to place them” and, according to one high-level \nDHHS official, “their appropriate level of placement has not been located.” The official \nwent on to acknowledge that North Carolina’s child welfare system “is in crisis” and “at \nany point there could be a massive class-action lawsuit.” \n18. This civil rights action seeks only declarative and prospective injunctive \nrelief on behalf of Named Plaintiff children Timothy B., Flora P., Isabella A., Steph C., \nand London R. through their Guardians ad Litem Robert Ward, Esq., Dr. Jeffrey C. \nHolden, Ph.D., and Meghann Gunderman Sehorn, and a class of similarly situated North \nCarolina youth with mental impairments in foster care (“the putative class”), as well as \nAssociational Plaintiffs Disability Rights North Carolina and the North Carolina State \nConference of NAACP, for DHHS’s violations of Title II of the Americans with \nDisabilities Act (“ADA”), 42 U.S.C. § 12101 et. seq., Section 504 of the Rehabilitation \nAct, 29 U.S.C. § 794 et. seq., and their implementing regulations.   \n19. Plaintiffs are North Carolina children with disabilities in foster care who \nhave been removed from their families and communities and are placed in, or at serious \nrisk of placement in, a PRTF. Often they have unnecessarily spent much of their \nchildhood languishing in these facilities, despite yearning to be in the community. By \nbeing unnecessarily confined to these facilities, they have been denied essential \nopportunities for healthy childhood development, such as living in a loving, supportive, \nfamily setting with community-based services, building intimate relationships with \ntrusted adults, exploring chosen passions and hobbies, and developing necessary \nindependent living skills. They also miss out on educational, employment, and social \n7\nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 35   Filed 03/06/23   Page 7 of 79\n\nopportunities with their nondisabled peers. In short, DHHS – the very agency that exists \nto support and protect these children – is denying them their childhood. \n20. Plaintiffs challenge DHHS’s systemic failures to ensure that children with \ndisabilities in foster care are cared for in the most integrated community-based setting \nappropriate to their needs, and that children in PRTFs are timely and appropriately \ndischarged to such settings. Plaintiffs seek to remedy DHHS’s ongoing statutory \nviolations on behalf of children who are entitled to be, and deserve to be, safely cared for \nin their communities. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE\n21. This class action for declaratory and prospective injunctive relief only is \nbrought to address Defendant’s ongoing deprivations of rights guaranteed by federal \nstatutory law under Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”), 42 U.S.C. \n§§ 12131-12134, and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. § 794. \n22. The Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28 \nU.S.C. §§ 1331 (federal question jurisdiction) and 1343(a)(3) (civil rights jurisdiction).  \n23. Plaintiffs’ claims for declaratory and injunctive relief are authorized by \n28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 and 2202 as well as Rules 57 and 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure. \n24. Venue is appropriate in the United States District Court for the Middle \nDistrict of North Carolina pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(2), because a substantial part \nof the events and omissions giving rise to the claims herein occurred in this District. For \n8\nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 35   Filed 03/06/23   Page 8 of 79\n\ninstance, one Named Plaintiff is currently unnecessarily confined to a facility located in \nHoke County, located in this District.  Two Named Plaintiffs are in the custody of \nDefendant’s agents in Montgomery County and Orange County, both of which are \nlocated in this District. Further, Defendant’s agents maintain places of business in this \nDistrict.  \nPARTIES \nI. Disability Rights North Carolina as Associational Plaintiff  \n25. Plaintiff Disability Rights North Carolina (“DRNC”) is an independent \nnon-profit corporation organized under the laws of the State of North Carolina with \noffices in the State of North Carolina located at 3724 National Drive, Suite 100, Raleigh, \nN.C. 27612.  \n26. DRNC is a Protection and Advocacy system (“P&A”), as that term is \ndefined under the Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act, 42 \nU.S.C. § 15041 et seq.; the Protection and Advocacy for Individuals with Mental Illness \nAct of 1986, 42 U.S.C. § 10801 et seq.; and the Protection and Advocacy of Individual \nRights Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794e et seq. \n27. As the P&A for the state of North Carolina, DRNC is specifically \nauthorized, and its primary function is, to pursue legal, administrative, and other \nappropriate remedies or approaches to ensure the protection of, and advocacy for, the \nrights of individuals with disabilities. 42 U.S.C. § 15043(a)(2)(A)(i).  \n9\nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 35   Filed 03/06/23   Page 9 of 79\n\n28. All people with disabilities in North Carolina, including the individual \nNamed Plaintiff children and members of the putative class in this action, are constituents \nof DRNC and have standing to sue in their own right. \n29. Pursuing and protecting the rights of children with disabilities to live and \nreceive services in the community and to be free from abuse and neglect is germane to \nDRNC’s purpose.   \n30. In this case, Plaintiff DRNC challenges Defendant’s patterns, customs, \npolicies, and/or practices, and the resulting discriminatory and unnecessary segregation \nand institutionalization of children with disabilities in foster care in PRTFs. Plaintiff \nDRNC seeks solely declarative and prospective injunctive relief, and no individual \nremedies.  \n31. DRNC is accountable to members of the disability community. DNRC \nmaintains a governance structure that ensures the P&A is reflective of and responsive to \nthe disability community. See 42 U.S.C. § 15043 (detailing program requirements); 42 \nU.S.C. § 10805 (detailing program requirements); 34 C.F.R. § 381.10(a) (detailing \nprogram requirements). More than half of DRNC’s board of directors and advisory \ncouncil members are individuals with disabilities or family members, guardians, or \nadvocates for individuals with disabilities. DRNC conducts annual surveys of the \ndisability community to determine the specific areas of advocacy on which the \norganization will focus. Members of the disability community have the right to file \ngrievances if they disagree with actions taken by DRNC or are wrongly denied services \nby DRNC.\n10\nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 35   Filed 03/06/23   Page 10 of 79\n\nII. North Carolina State Conference of NAACP as Associational Plaintiff  \n32. Plaintiff North Carolina State Conference of NAACP (“NC NAACP”) is a \ngrassroots and membership based nonprofit civil rights organization. The NC NAACP \nwas established in 1938 as a state conference branch of the National Association for the \nAdvancement of Colored People (“NAACP”), a national civil rights organization. It is the \noldest and largest civil rights organization in North Carolina, with nearly 100 active \nbranches in urban and rural communities throughout the state. \n33. The NC NAACP’s mission is to ensure the rights of all persons to equality \nand to eliminate racial discrimination. It dedicates significant organizational resources to \nprotecting and advancing civil rights and racial justice for African Americans, people of \ncolor, and other groups of people historically denied those rights in North Carolina.1\n34. Protecting the rights of children of color in foster care to live and receive \nservices in their communities, rather than unnecessarily confined to PRTFs, and be free \nfrom all forms of discrimination, including unnecessary segregation and denial of \ncommunity-based placements and supportive services, is germane to NC NAACP’s \npurpose. The national NAACP has also stressed the urgency of addressing the \noverrepresentation of African American children in the foster care system and ensuring \n1 This has included, for instance, regularly engaging in voting equality efforts to ensure \nthat African American children are not victims of racial discrimination or \ndisproportionality, afforded equal protection under the law, and are not discriminated \nagainst by government agencies. \n11\nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 35   Filed 03/06/23   Page 11 of 79\n\nthat they receive equal and necessary health services, including community-based mental \nhealth services.  \n35. In this case, Plaintiff NC NAACP challenges Defendant’s patterns, \ncustoms, policies, and/or practices—and the resulting discriminatory and unnecessary \nsegregation and institutionalization of children with disabilities in foster care in PRTFs—\nwhich violates their rights under the ADA and Rehabilitation Act. \n36. African American and children of color within the putative class, such as \nFlora P., Steph C., and London R., are constituents of NC NAACP. \n37. The NC NAACP also has over 20,000 paid members who registered, on \nbehalf of themselves and their families, to stand up against racial disparities. This is the \nlargest number of members of any NAACP state conference in the South, and the second \nlargest in the country. Named Plaintiffs Timothy B., Flora P., Steph C., and London R. \nare youth members of the NC NAACP.  \n38. Named Plaintiffs who are constituents and members of NC NAACP have \nstanding to sue in their own right. These Named Plaintiffs suffered harms that result from \nand are traceable to the conduct and inaction of DHHS. Guardian ad Litem Robert Ward, \nGuardian ad Litem Dr. Holden, and Guardian ad Litem Meghann Gunderman Sehorn are \nmembers of the NAACP. \n39. Many of NC NAACP’s members are also actively engaged as parents, \nfamily members, and informal family members, such as God-parents or community \nparents, of children who are presently in foster care placements. Some of these children \n12\nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 35   Filed 03/06/23   Page 12 of 79\n\nhave, in the past and/or presently, been unnecessarily placed in harmful PRTFs or remain \nat risk of such placement due to Defendant’s failures.  \n40. For these reasons, the NC NAACP is uniquely situated to seek legal \nprotections for African American children and children of racial minorities with \ndisabilities who are or remain at risk of placement in PRTFs, and are unable to \nindependently assert or seek legal protections or to provide the Court with information \ncontextualizing the severity of the injury imposed by their unnecessary and segregated \nplacement in these facilities. \nIII. Named Plaintiffs and Guardians ad Litem2\nA. Named Plaintiff Timothy B. \n41.  Timothy B. is a 14-year-old child with disabilities in the custody of \nDHHS’s agent, Robeson County DSS, who is unnecessarily institutionalized in a PRTF.  \n42. Timothy B. is a member of the Lumbee Tribe of North Carolina and a \nyouth member of the NC NAACP.  \n43. Timothy B. is a constituent of DRNC.  \n2 The Named Plaintiffs’ names listed in this complaint are pseudonyms to protect their \nidentities. Plaintiffs filed a motion seeking permission to use these pseudonyms in the \nlitigation, and are filing a supplemental motion contemporaneously with this amended \ncomplaint. Plaintiffs are also filing an additional Motion for Appointment of Guardian ad \nLitem contemporaneously with this amended complaint. \n13\nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 35   Filed 03/06/23   Page 13 of 79\n\n44. Timothy B. has DSM-V diagnoses that substantially limit one or more \nmajor life activity, including self-care, learning, concentrating, thinking, interacting with \nothers, and the operation of the major bodily function of the brain.  \n45. When he was very young, DHHS removed Timothy B. from his mother’s \nhouse. In or around 2019, Timothy B. moved from his father’s home and returned to his \nmother’s house. \n46. In February of 2020, agents of DHHS placed Timothy B. at a PRTF in \nRaeford, NC. Now, almost three years later, he continues to live in that PRTF in \ndeplorable conditions, through the present. Timothy B.’s room is totally bare, with only a \ngreen pad as a mattress, no mattress cover, one pillow, and a blanket. There is no \nfurniture in his room. Timothy B. has nowhere to keep private paperwork and has had \nstaff throw out items that were important to him. \n47. The PRTF is primarily made up of one common room, where children \nspend almost all of their time. Children eat all of their meals, attend school, meet with \nvisitors, and do all of their socializing in the same small room. \n48.  Timothy B. has been placed on a powerful cocktail of psychotropic \nmedications while at the PRTF. He is subject to polypharmacy, which is an outlier \nprescription practice that consists of the concurrent administration to children of multiple \npsychotropic medications. He is currently taking Prozac, Risperdal, and other \nmedications he cannot name. \n49. Timothy B. has been the target of bullying from staff while at the PRTF, \nincluding being called “crybaby,” “b*tch,” and other derogatory terms. \n14\nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 35   Filed 03/06/23   Page 14 of 79\n\n50. While at the PRTF, it took months before Timothy B. received a \npsychological evaluation.  \n51. As a child in the custody of child welfare, Timothy B. is categorically \neligible for Medicaid-funded services in the community and may be eligible for \nadditional state-funded services. \n52. Placement in the community with community-based mental and behavioral \nhealth services is appropriate for Timothy B.  \n53. Timothy B. receives one short individual therapy session per week at which \nTimothy B. and his therapist typically talk through a worksheet. Timothy B. also meets \nwith a psychiatrist for about 15 minutes once a week on Tuesdays. These services can be \nprovided in the community. \n54. The PRTF has repeatedly talked with Timothy B. about transitioning him to \na lower level of care but also tells him at his monthly child and family team meetings that \n“nobody’s accepting you, see you again next month.”   \n55. Timothy B. has repeatedly stated that he does not feel safe at the PRTF.  \n56. While Timothy B. has been at the PRTF, DHHS has cited the facility for \nfailing to ensure that youth receive judicial review hearings to which they are statutorily \nentitled. DHHS also found that staff cursed at and picked on the residents, that one staff \nmember had a former conviction of assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill, and \nthat one staff member was suspended for talking about guns and drinking within earshot \nof residents.  \n15\nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 35   Filed 03/06/23   Page 15 of 79\n\n57. Timothy B. has expressed multiple times that he wishes to leave the PRTF \nand live with his great-grandmother. At a recent child and family team meeting, when he \nwas asked “what’s not working,” he said, “I’m still at the PRTF.”  \n58.  Timothy B. wants to live in the community with appropriate services and \nsupports. He would like to participate in normal, adolescent activities such as playing \nsports, shopping, being with family, and going to a grocery store. But he is forced to live \na regimented and segregated life at the PRTF. He is restricted from attending school in \nthe community or interacting with nondisabled peers.  \n59. DHHS can accommodate Timothy B. in the community through its existing \narray of home and community-based placements and services. \n60. Timothy B. brings this action through his Guardian ad Litem Robert Ward.  \nB. Named Plaintiff Flora P.  \n61. Flora P. is a fifteen-year-old child with disabilities in the custody of \nDHHS’s agent, Durham County DSS, who was unnecessarily institutionalized in a PRTF, \nand is currently at serious risk of returning unnecessarily to a PRTF. \n62. Flora P. is African American and a youth member of the NC NAACP.  \n63. Flora P. is a constituent of DRNC.  \n64. Flora P.’s diagnoses include Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (“PTSD”), \nDisruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder (“DMDD”), and Attention Deficit \nHyperactivity Disorder (“ADHD”). These diagnoses substantially limit one or more \n16\nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 35   Filed 03/06/23   Page 16 of 79\n\nmajor life activity, including self-care, learning, concentrating, interacting with others, \nand the operation of the major bodily function of the brain.  \n65. Flora P. was first in the foster care system as a toddler. She was adopted at \nage three but then reentered the child welfare system as a teenager, after her adoptive \nparents divorced and later abandoned her.  \n66. Flora P. was recently discharged from a PRTF in Leland, NC, where she \nhad been since February 2022, to a Level III group home. The group home did not have a \ntherapist on staff for part of the time Flora P. was placed there. Flora P. was discharged \nfrom the group home placement shortly after entering. She was then quickly moved in \nand out of a temporary, rapid-response family foster home. A smaller setting with \nyounger children or no other children has been identified as a better placement for Flora \nP., but agents of DHHS have not found a long-term placement in the community that \nmatches these criteria for her. Due to the unavailability of appropriate placements and \nservices in the community, she is at serious risk of unnecessary re-institutionalization.     \n67. While at the PRTF, Flora P. was subject to polypharmacy.  She was on a \npowerful cocktail of psychotropic medications, including Trazadone, Trileptal, and others \nshe cannot recall. She was subjected to both physical and chemical restraints that \nphysically harmed her. Since her discharge from the PRTF, she continues to be subject to \npolypharmacy and recently had her medication increased, bringing the total number of \npills she is required to take every day to 26. \n17\nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 35   Filed 03/06/23   Page 17 of 79\n\n68. As a child in the custody of child welfare, Flora P. is categorically eligible \nfor Medicaid-funded services in the community and may be eligible for additional state-\nfunded services.  \n69. Placement in the community with community-based mental and behavioral \nhealth services is appropriate for Flora P. \n70. Flora P. was recommended for a Level III Group Home placement in the \ncommunity months before her discharge but lingered at a PRTF because there was no \nopening for her in a Level III placement. \n71. Flora P. wants to live in the community with appropriate services and \nsupports. She would like to live with less people, and she hopes to have more privacy and \nautonomy. Her healthy coping mechanisms include spending time outside and alone, but \nshe cannot freely do those things in a crowded, locked PRTF setting.    \n72. Because agents of DHHS confined Flora P. to a PRTF, she could not \nparticipate in normal, adolescent activities that she enjoys, such as cooking for the \nhomeless; baking cakes, cupcakes, and cookies; and pursuing her goal to become a \nbusinesswoman in the future.  \n73. DHHS can accommodate Flora P. in the community through its existing \narray of home and community-based placements and services. \n74. Flora P. brings this action through her Guardian ad Litem Robert Ward.  \n18\nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 35   Filed 03/06/23   Page 18 of 79\n\nC. Named Plaintiff Isabella A.  \n75. Isabella A. is a 13-year-old child with disabilities in the custody of DHHS’s \nagent, Montgomery County DSS, who is unnecessarily institutionalized in a PRTF.  \n76. Isabella A. is a constituent of DRNC.  \n77. Isabella A.’s diagnoses include PTSD, ADHD, and DMDD. These \ndiagnoses substantially limit one or more major life activities, including self-care, \nlearning, concentrating, interacting with others, and the operation of the major bodily \nfunction of the brain.  \n78. Isabella A. is in foster care in the care and custody of Montgomery County \nDSS. \n79. Isabella A.’s childhood has been marked by instability. During her five \nyears in foster care in DSS custody, DHHS’s agent has shuffled Isabella A. among over \n20 placements, including at least three highly restrictive PRTFs.  \n80. At one point in spring 2022, Isabella A. was without any placement and \nspent several days living and sleeping in the conference room of a DSS office. The office \nis not equipped or intended for children to stay in overnight; cots were brought in for \nchildren to sleep on, and Isabella A. had to walk to another building nearby to shower.  \n81. Isabella A. is currently confined in a PRTF in Jacksonville, N.C., where she \nhas been since July 2022.  \n82. While at the PRTF, Isabella A. has been subject to a physical restraint and \nis currently subject to polypharmacy. \n19\nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 35   Filed 03/06/23   Page 19 of 79\n\n83. The conditions at the PRTF can be punitive in nature, with many arbitrary \nrules that children would not experience in a family environment. Isabella A. has limited \nchances to engage in developmentally-appropriate activities that other adolescents \nregularly do, such as developing relationships with friends of her choosing; or freely \nengaging in her hobbies and coping mechanisms, such as coloring, drawing, listening to \nmusic, and playing cards. She can only spend limited amounts of time outside when it is \ncold because she does not have enough warm winter clothes.  \n84. At the PRTF, Isabella A. has been the target of bullying behavior, including \npainful sexual harassment, from peers. While Isabella A. has been at the PRTF, it has \nbeen cited by DHHS for staff failing to appropriately supervise children, such that suicide \nattempts, fighting, and serious injuries occur.  \n85. As a child in the custody of child welfare, Isabella A. is categorically \neligible for Medicaid-funded services in the community and may be eligible for \nadditional state-funded services.  \n86. Placement in the community with community-based mental and behavioral \nhealth services is appropriate for Isabella A. She was previously placed in several \ncommunity-based TFC homes. At her most recent TFC placement, DHHS did not \nprovide timely therapy upon placement, intensive in-home services, or additional wrap \naround services to support her placement in the community.  \n87. Isabella A. is currently receiving weekly individual therapy, bi-weekly \nfamily therapy with a DSS social worker and her attorney, “recreational” therapy on \n20\nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 35   Filed 03/06/23   Page 20 of 79\n\nWednesdays and Thursdays, and group therapy on Monday, Tuesday, and Friday – all of \nwhich can be provided in the community. \n88. Isabella A. wants to live in the community with appropriate services and \nsupports and attend a traditional school. She has repeatedly expressed a desire to be freed \nfrom the PRTF, as she believes the confinement is not only unhelpful, but actively \nharmful.  \n89. DHHS can accommodate Isabella A. in the community through its existing \narray of home and community-based placements and services.  \n90. Isabella A. brings this action through her Guardian ad Litem Dr. Holden.  \nD. Named Plaintiff Steph C. \n91. Steph C. is a 15-year-old child with disabilities in the care and custody of \nDHHS’s agent, Craven County DSS, who was unnecessarily institutionalized in a PRTF, \nand is currently at risk of returning to a PRTF.  \n92.  Steph C. is African American and a youth member of the NC NAACP.  \n93. Steph C. is a constituent of DRNC.  \n94. Steph C.’s diagnoses include PTSD, DMDD, Borderline Intellectual \nFunctioning, ADHD, and Conduct Disorder. Steph C. is substantially limited in one or \nmore major life activities, including self-care, learning, and interacting with others and \nthe operation of the major bodily function of the brain.  \n95. Steph C.’s childhood has been marked by instability due to DHHS’s agents’ \nfailure to provide an appropriate placement and services for him. In the eight years since \n21\nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 35   Filed 03/06/23   Page 21 of 79\n\nhis removal due to alleged domestic violence and physical abuse, DHHS’s agents have \nshuffled him through over 50 different placements. These placements have included \nseveral group homes and at least 7 different PRTFs throughout the state. \n96. Steph C. was most recently confined to a PRTF in Kinston, N.C., where he \nhad been since April 2022.       \n97. While at the PRTF, Steph C. was subject to repeated physical abuse by \npeers and suffered at least two serious head injuries. Steph C. was airlifted to a hospital \ntrauma center after another youth at the PRTF slammed his head to the ground, causing \nhim to lose consciousness. On a separate occasion, Steph C. suffered a head injury from \nan assault by another youth at the PRTF and ended up in the Emergency Room. Staff at \nthe PRTF then moved Steph C. to a unit with much younger children, ostensibly for his \nsafety.  \n98. Steph C. was subjected to physical restraints and polypharmacy while at the \nPRTF. He was on a powerful cocktail of multiple psychotropic medications. \n99.The PRTF told Steph C. of plans to discharge Steph C. to a lower level of care \nmultiple times during his confinement, but he remained at the facility.  \n100. Steph C. was finally discharged from the PRTF to a Level III group home \nin the community on January 8, 2023.  \n101. The local school system refuses to enroll Steph C. He has been denied an \neducation for nearly two months and spends his days running errands with staff and \nhanging out in the group home while the other residents attend school. He wants to go to \nschool and would like to play football.  \n22\nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 35   Filed 03/06/23   Page 22 of 79\n\n102. He receives one hour of individual therapy per week.  \n103. As a child in the custody of child welfare, Steph C. is categorically eligible \nfor Medicaid-funded services in the community and may be eligible for additional state-\nfunded services.  \n104. Continued placement in the community with community-based mental and \nbehavioral health services is appropriate for Steph C.   \n105. Agents of DHHS have initiated the Interstate Compact on the Placement of \nChildren process to place him out-of-state with is biological aunt.  \n106.  Steph C. has previously lived in several different community-based \nplacements with community-based treatment, such as outpatient therapy and intensive in-\nhome therapy. Steph C. had an over one-year period of stability living with a foster \nparent in a specialized therapeutic foster home.   \n107.  Steph C. wants to continue to live in the community with appropriate \nservices and supports. He has repeatedly expressed a desire to live in a family home with \nhis biological aunt.  \n108. DHHS can accommodate Steph C. in the community through its existing \narray of home and community-based placements and services. \n109. Steph C. has been institutionalized multiple times in the past and remains at \nserious risk of unnecessary re-institutionalization. For example, when he recently became \nfrustrated, he left the group home and went for a walk. Because he is not allowed to leave \nthe group home unsupervised, the police were called and he was transported to the \nhospital and kept overnight. The lack of appropriate rapid response services and the \n23\nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 35   Filed 03/06/23   Page 23 of 79\n\ninvolvement of police increase the likelihood that Steph C. will be unnecessarily re-\ninstitutionalized.    \n110. Steph C. brings this action through his Guardian ad Litem Dr. Holden.  \nE. Named Plaintiff London R. \n111. London R. is a 16-year-old child with disabilities in the custody of DHHS’s \nagent, Mecklenburg County DSS, who is unnecessarily institutionalized in a PRTF.  \n112. London R. is African American and a youth member of the NC NAACP.  \n113. London R. is a constituent of DRNC.  \n114. London R.’s diagnoses include PTSD, ADHD, and DMDD. These \ndiagnoses substantially limit one or more major life activity, including self-care, learning, \nconcentrating, interacting with others, and the operation of the major bodily function of \nthe brain.  \n115. London R. was removed from her home and placed in foster care before the \nage of 10. Her parents’ parental rights have been terminated. \n116. Agents of DHHS have placed London R. in dozens of different placements. \nShe has lived in foster care homes, group homes, and several PRTFs throughout North \nCarolina and South Carolina. In between these placements, agents of DHHS, unable to \nlocate appropriate placements, have left London R. in a youth crisis center, hotels, and \nhospitals for weeks at a time. \n24\nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 35   Filed 03/06/23   Page 24 of 79\n\n117. London R. is currently confined to a PRTF located in Rock Hill, S.C. where \nshe has been since November 2022.3 This PRTF placement was not clinically-indicated.  \nIt was intended only as a short-term, emergency placement. Instead, London R. has \nlanguished at this PRTF for nearly four months and remains there today.   \n118. While at the PRTF, London R. has been subject to polypharmacy. She takes \nat least 12 pills every day and is currently on a powerful cocktail of psychotropic \nmedications, including Lithium, Clonidine, Geodon, and Atarax.    \n119. London R.’s “temporary” confinement to the PRTF continues indefinitely. \nShe does not feel safe from other residents at the PRTF, and is uncomfortable that male \nstaff work the overnight shift on all-female halls. Additionally, London R. is very close \nwith her little brother but has not been able to spend much time with him since her \nconfinement to the PRTF. She felt the sting of their separation very keenly during his \nbirthday earlier in the month.   \n120. London R.’s room consists of a wooden bed and wooden dresser. The \nmattress on her bed is uncomfortable and it is longer than the bed frame, such that the \nexcess length curves up on the end. While there are “jack-and-jill” bathrooms between \nadjoining bedrooms, these have been locked and London R. must instead use a hall \nbathroom. The residents are not allowed to wear regular shoes outside, and must instead \n3 Rock Hill is located within 40 miles of the North Carolina border and is considered “in \nstate” for purposes of NC Medicaid but is out-of-state for purposes of regulation and \noversight by DHHS.

The \nresidents rarely leave the PRTF.  \n121. London R. attends “school” online for hours per day in a single classroom \nused for all of the high-school-aged PRTF residents. No non-PRTF-residents attend the \nschool. Although London R. previously, and successfully, has attended community-based \nschools, she has not been offered any option to attend a community-based school while at \nthe PRTF. London R. is finding it difficult to concentrate and stay awake in school \nbecause of her medications. \n122. As a child in the custody of child welfare, London R. categorically is \neligible for Medicaid-funded services in the community and may be eligible for \nadditional state-funded services. \n123. Placement in the community with community-based mental and/or \nbehavioral health services is appropriate for London R. In or around February 2022, \nLondon R.’s treatment providers first recommended she be placed in Intensive \nAlternative Family Treatment (IAFT) foster care, a North Carolina community-based \ntherapeutic foster care program. Later in November 2022, when she entered the Rock Hill \nPRTF, London R.’s treatment providers again recommended she be placed in IAFT, but \nsince DHHS’s agents were unable to find her an IAFT or any other appropriate \ncommunity placement, she is stuck at the PRTF.  \n124. London R. receives one, one-hour individual therapy session per week and \none-to-two group therapy sessions per week. London R. also meets with a psychiatrist for \nabout 5 minutes once a week. These services can be provided in the community. \n26\nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 35   Filed 03/06/23   Page 26 of 79\n\n125. London R. wants to live in the community with appropriate services and \nsupports. London R. has repeatedly stated that she does not feel safe at the PRTF. London \nR. has expressed multiple times that she wishes to leave the PRTF and live in the \ncommunity, so that she is prepared to enter adulthood.  \n126. London R. wants to live with a family and re-establish contact with her \nsiblings. She enjoys arts and crafts, particularly drawing, but the PRTF does not provide \nsupplies she needs to freely engage in these activities in the PRTF.  \n127. DHHS can accommodate London R. in the community through its existing \narray of home and community-based placements and services. \n128. London R. brings this action through her Guardian ad Litem Meghann \nGunderman Sehorn.\nF. Guardian ad Litem Robert Ward  \n129.

Ms. Gunderman Sehorn is able to represent and act upon the best \ninterests of London R. and the putative class without any conflict or bias. \nIV. Defendant \n141. Kody Kinsley is the current Secretary of the North Carolina Department of \nHealth and Human Services and is sued in his official capacity only. \n142. According to DHHS, “as Secretary, Kinsley oversees a department that has \nbroad responsibility for all aspects of health and human services, a staff of 18,000 and an \nannual budget of $26 billion.” \n29\nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 35   Filed 03/06/23   Page 29 of 79\n\n143. DHHS and Secretary Kinsley in his official capacity are legally responsible \nfor compliance with the ADA and Rehabilitation Act for the Plaintiffs and putative class, \nincluding for the policies, customs, patterns, and practices alleged in this complaint. \n144. DHHS is a principal department of the North Carolina Executive Branch \nwith wide-ranging functions, powers, duties, and obligations. DHHS, by and through its \nvarious divisions, oversees and operates all aspects of the North Carolina child welfare \nsystem. The DSS (Division of Social Services) within DHHS supervises and provides \ntechnical assistance to county DSS offices, which make placement decisions for youth in \nfoster care, including PRTF placement. The Division of Health Services Regulation \n(“DHSR”) within DHHS monitors and oversees all licensed mental health facilities in \nNorth Carolina, including PRTFs. DHHS administers North Carolina’s statewide \nMedicaid program (“NC Medicaid”) through its Division of Health Benefits. DHHS also \noversees mental health and developmental disability services, including treatment at \nPRTFs, through its Division of Mental Health, Developmental Disabilities, and \nSubstance Abuse Services (“DMH/DD/SAS”). This division is also responsible for \nensuring that high-quality mental health and developmental disability services are \navailable to people that need them. The DMH/DD/SAS division contains the statutorily-\ncreated Commission for Mental Health, Developmental Disabilities and Substance Abuse \nServices, which has the authority to adopt and repeal rules pertaining to all mental health \nprograms, including operating standards for licensed mental health facilities such as \nPRTFs. \n30\nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 35   Filed 03/06/23   Page 30 of 79\n\n145. DHHS has non-delegable direct and ultimate responsibility for the care, \nconditions of custody, placement, and services for all North Carolina youth in foster care, \nincluding the Named Plaintiffs and all members of the putative class. \n146. Secretary Kinsley enjoys broad statutory authority over DHHS, including \nthe ability to create and eliminate subdivisions within his department and direct \ndepartmental responsibilities to any of his subordinates. \n147. Secretary Kinsley has supervision, direction, and control over all DHHS \nemployees. \n148. Secretary Kinsley has the power to create or eliminate positions; make \nappointments to, and remove persons from, such positions; transfer officers and \nemployees between positions; and change existing positions’ duties, titles, and \ncompensation. \n149. Secretary Kinsley is responsible for all DHHS managerial functions, \nincluding planning, organizing, staffing, coordinating, reporting, and budgeting. To that \nend, he must prepare and present to the governor an annual report on DHHS’s work, \nDHHS’s planned work for the coming year, and DHHS’s budget request. \n150. Secretary Kinsley is statutorily responsible for supervising the regional- \nand county-level administration of North Carolina’s child welfare system through local \nDSS at the county level. For instance, DHHS must supervise each county’s board of \nsocial services’ establishment of policies. Each county director of social services – who, \namong other things, accepts children for placement and supervises placements – “act[s] \nas [an] agent of . . . [DHHS] . . . in relation to the work required by . . . [DHHS].” \n31\nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 35   Filed 03/06/23   Page 31 of 79\n\n151. Secretary Kinsley also has authority to “adopt and enforce rules” applicable \nto local DSS offices. This includes rules related to “the placement of individuals in \nlicensable facilities located outside the individual’s community and [the] ability of the \nproviders to return [them] . . . to [their] community as soon as possible without \ndetriment,” and “the monitoring of mental health [and] developmental disability . . . \nservices.” \n152. Secretary Kinsley has acknowledged the need to improve North Carolina’s \nmental health system and provide more support to children in DHHS’s care, “specifically \naround kids that are engaged in the foster care system.” He told lawmakers in June 2022 \nthat “[u]nfortunately, our children and the behavioral health needs of our kids have \nlanguished in our state for far too long.” \n153. DHHS and its agents maintain offices in all counties located in this District.  \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n154. Named Plaintiffs Timothy B., Flora P., Isabella A., Steph C., and London \nR. bring this action pursuant to Rule 23(a) and (b)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure on behalf of themselves and a putative class of similarly situated children. \n155. Putative Class: All Plaintiffs seek to represent a Class defined as all \nchildren that meet the following criteria now or during the pendency of this action:  \n(a) children who are or will be in North Carolina foster care,4 who are or will \nbe in the custody of a North Carolina county department of social services;5\n(b) with a mental impairment that substantially limits at least one major life \nactivity,  or  a  record  of  such  an  impairment;  (c)  who  are  unnecessarily \n4 See N.C. Gen. Stat. § 7B-903(a)(6). \n5 See N.C. Gen. Stat. § 7B-101(8a). \n32\nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 35   Filed 03/06/23   Page 32 of 79\n\ninstitutionalized  in  a  PRTF  or  who  are  at  serious  risk  of  such \ninstitutionalization.6\n156. Numerosity. The putative class is sufficiently numerous to make joinder of \nall its members impracticable. During North Carolina’s Fiscal Years 2018 to 2022, there \nwere at least 1,900 paid Medicaid claims to place North Carolina children in foster care \nin PRTFs. State data shows that as of November 2021, over a one-year period, 572 \nchildren involved with North Carolina’s child welfare system were placed in PRTFs. This \nrepresents an increase compared to previous years. The increase is compounded by the \nongoing lack of adequate community-based treatment and services available in North \nCarolina. These factors mean that even more children in foster care are at risk of future \nplacement in PRTFs. \n157. Additionally, children in foster care in North Carolina move with extreme \nfrequency among placements, including in and out of PRTFs and from PRTF to PRTF.  \nThis makes joinder of all class members even more impractical because of the fluid and \ninherently transitory nature of the putative class members’ experience in child welfare \ncustody. For instance, Named Plaintiff Isabella A. has been shuffled among over 20 \nplacements during her five years in foster care, and Named Plaintiff Steph C. has \nexperienced over 50 different placements over the past eight years, including at least 7 \nPRTF placements. Similarly, Named Plaintiff London R. has experienced dozens of \ndifferent placements during her time in foster care, including various foster homes, group \n6 Children at serious risk of unnecessary institutionalization in a PRTF include children \nwith a mental health or behavioral health diagnosis(es) who, for instance, were previously \ninstitutionalized or placed in a restrictive care setting such as a PRTF.\n33\nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 35   Filed 03/06/23   Page 33 of 79\n\nhomes, and several PRTFs throughout North Carolina and South Carolina. From 2015 to \n2016, youth in foster care in North Carolina experienced 2.1 placements moves per 1,000 \ndays in care. In 2019, North Carolina’s rate of placement moves per 1,000 days in foster \ncare was over 5.9 moves, worse than the national performance standard of 4.1. \n158. Thus, as a result of this instability and the lack of sufficient community-\nbased placements and supportive services, and as set forth herein, many additional \nchildren with disabilities in foster care are at serious risk of placement in PRTFs.   \n159. Joinder is also impracticable because Class members lack the knowledge \nand financial means to maintain individual actions.  \n160. Commonality. The common questions of law and fact shared by the Named \nPlaintiffs and the putative class they seek to represent include: \na. Whether Defendant has a pattern, custom, policy, and/or practice of \nadministering its programs in a manner that results in the unnecessary \nsegregation of children in the putative class in PRTFs. \nb. Whether Defendant has a pattern, custom, policy, and/or practice of \nadministering its programs in a manner and through methods that result \nin the unnecessary segregation of children in the putative class by \nfailing to plan for, develop, operate, and fund a sufficient array of \ncommunity-based supports, including community-based placements and \nsupportive mental and behavioral health services, for children in foster \n34\nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 35   Filed 03/06/23   Page 34 of 79\n\ncare and their caregivers that would allow children in the putative class \nto live in integrated settings. \nc. Whether Defendant has a pattern, custom, policy, and/or practice of \nadministering its programs in a manner and through methods that result \nin the failure to transition or timely transition children in the putative \nclass out of PRTFs and into stable, integrated community-based \nplacements when they are ready for discharge.  \nd. Whether Defendant’s patterns, customs, policies, and/or practices with \nrespect to the putative class violate Title II of the Americans with \nDisabilities Act.  \ne. Whether Defendant’s patterns, customs, policies and/or practices with \nrespect to the putative class violate Section 504 of the Rehabilitation \nAct.  \n161. Typicality. The claims of the Named Plaintiffs are typical of the legal \nviolations and harms suffered by all Class Members. The Named Plaintiffs are members \nof the putative class who have been confined to PRTFs despite the appropriateness of \ncommunity-based placements and services and their desire to be treated in the \ncommunity. They are also all subject to or at serious risk of being subjected to the \npatterns, customs, policies and/or practices identified in this complaint with respect to the \nputative class. The Named Plaintiffs are entitled to the same injunctive and declaratory \nrelief that addresses these policies and practices for the putative class.  \n35\nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 35   Filed 03/06/23   Page 35 of 79\n\n162. Adequacy of Representation. The Named Plaintiffs will fairly and \nadequately protect the interests of the entire Class. The Named Plaintiffs are seeking only \nsystemic relief that will benefit all members of the putative class. There are no known \nconflicts of interest between the Named Plaintiffs and the members of the putative class \nthey seek to represent. \n163. The Guardians ad Litem Robert Ward, Dr. Holden, and Meghann \nGunderman Sehorn are truly dedicated to representing the best interests of the Named \nPlaintiffs that they represent. The Guardians ad Litem are both familiar with the harms \nexperienced by the Named Plaintiffs and the claims in this litigation.  \n164. Plaintiffs’ counsel are:  \na. Attorneys from DRNC, North Carolina’s federally mandated Protection \nand Advocacy agency;  \nb. Attorneys from Children’s Rights, a national non-profit children’s \nadvocacy organization;  \nc. Attorneys from the NC NAACP, a North Carolina civil rights advocacy \norganization; and \nd. Attorneys from Moore & Van Allen, PLLC, a full-service law firm \nheadquartered in Charlotte, NC, acting as pro bono counsel.  \n165. Plaintiffs’ attorneys are well-suited to fairly and adequately represent the \ninterests of the putative class. These attorneys have experience litigating complex class \nactions in federal court, including civil rights litigation and specific litigation with respect \n36\nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 35   Filed 03/06/23   Page 36 of 79\n\nto the foster care system, disabilities, and government system failures. Plaintiffs’ \nattorneys have also committed sufficient resources to represent the putative class.  \n166. As detailed throughout this complaint, the Defendant has acted or refused \nto act on grounds generally applicable to the putative class, thereby making final \ninjunctive and declaratory relief appropriate with respect to the putative class as a whole \nunder Rule 23(b)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  \n167. The injuries of the putative class can be redressed by a single injunctive and \ndeclaratory judgement that declares DHHS’s conduct unlawful and orders DHHS to: end \nits unlawful methods of administration and unnecessary segregation of children with \ndisabilities in foster care in PRTFs; increase its capacity to serve the needs of children \nwith disabilities in foster care in community-based placements with mental and \nbehavioral health services in the community; and timely transition children in foster care \nplaced in PRTFs out of PRTFs into community-based placements with supportive \nservices.  \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \nV. Defendant Has Responsibility for Administering and Overseeing All \nAspects of the Child Welfare System in North Carolina  \n168. DHHS is the designated single state agency responsible for administering \nand overseeing all child welfare services in North Carolina. 42 U.S.C. § 621; N.C. Gen. \nStat. § 108A-71 & -74. \n169. DHHS “is responsible for ensuring the health, safety and well-being of all \nNorth Carolinians.”  \n37\nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 35   Filed 03/06/23   Page 37 of 79\n\n170. DHHS also “manages the delivery of health- and human-related services \nfor all North Carolinians, especially [its] most vulnerable citizens – children.” \n171. DHHS is required by federal law to administer all of its services and \nprograms to children in the state in a manner that does not discriminate against children \nwith disabilities. See 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b); 45 C.F.R. § 84.4(b)(4).  \n172. DHHS has the direct, ultimate, and non-delegable duty to comply with \nfederal statutory obligations under Title II of the ADA and Section 504 with respect to all \nchildren with disabilities in foster care, including the putative class. As a practical matter, \nDHHS delegates to its county DSS offices many of its day-to-day child welfare functions, \nwhile continuing to directly oversee these functions in a number of ways. Each county \ndirector of social services is the statutorily appointed agent of DHHS for all child welfare \nrelated work carried out in the county. N.C. Gen. Stat. § 108A-14(a). DHHS therefore \ndirects, controls, and is liable for the acts and omissions of county departments of social \nservices, who act as DHHS’s agents in the delivery of services to children in foster care, \nspecifically in arranging for placements and the delivery of services as alleged in this \ncomplaint. \n173. DHHS must take over the provision of child welfare services when its \nagents do not meet their obligations or fail to provide child welfare services in \naccordance with state law. N.C. Gen. Stat. § 108A-74(a3)-(c1), (c) & (h). DHHS has \nexercised this power as recently as May 2022. \n174. North Carolina’s provision of services to children removed from their \nhomes and placed in state custody by its child welfare agents, as well as other child \n38\nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 35   Filed 03/06/23   Page 38 of 79\n\nwelfare services, are financed in part by federal funds distributed under Title IV-E of the \nSocial Security Act. As of 2018, these funds financed 42% of North Carolina’s child \nwelfare spending. \n175. To maintain eligibility for such federal funds, North Carolina must have a \nState Plan for administering its foster care system that complies with federal law and \ndesignate a state agency responsible for the administration of the plan.  \n176. The North Carolina State Plan includes, among other things, the state’s \nstrategies for:  \na. identifying and treating mental health needs of children in foster care;  \nb. guaranteeing that children in foster care are not inappropriately \ndiagnosed and institutionalized;  \nc. ensuring the appropriate use of medication for children in foster care; \nand  \nd. guaranteeing face-to-face visits by social workers with children in foster \ncare at least monthly that are focused on the child’s safety, permanency, \nand well-being. 42 U.S.C. § 622.  \n177. As the designated single state agency under Title IV-E, DHHS must ensure \nthat the State Plan is “in effect in all political subdivisions of the State, and, if \nadministered by them, be mandatory upon them,” as well as “monitor and conduct \nperiodic evaluations” of the foster care program. \n178. In addition to the explicit principal-agent relationship established by N.C. \nGen. Stat. § 108A-14(a), North Carolina statutes outline a separate scheme by which \n39\nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 35   Filed 03/06/23   Page 39 of 79\n\nDHHS monitors the counties’ provision of social services. Each year, the Secretary of \nDHHS must require all county departments to enter written performance agreements that \nspecify mandated performance requirements and administrative responsibilities regarding \nsocial service programs, including child welfare. N.C. Gen. Stat. § 108A-74.These \nagreements allow DHHS to withhold funds from the county office if it cannot satisfy \nmandated performance requirements or otherwise comply with the terms of the \nagreement or applicable law. N.C. Gen. Stat. § 108A-74(a3), -74(a2)(4). If a local \ndepartment cannot comply with the terms of the agreement, the mandated performance \nmeasures, or other applicable law, DHHS and the local department must enter a joint \ncorrective action plan. N.C. Gen. Stat. § 108A-74(a3). If a local department cannot \ncomplete the corrective action plan, the Secretary of DHHS may temporarily assume all \nor part of the local department’s services administration. N.C. Gen. Stat. § 108A-74(b). \nDHHS can withhold funds if it determines that a local department is not providing foster \ncare services in accordance with state law and the “failure to provide the services poses a \nsubstantial threat to the safety and welfare of children in the county who receive or are \neligible to receive the services.” N.C. Gen. Stat. § 108A-74(h). These agreements \nbetween DHHS and their county DSS agents require DHHS and its agents to provide \nchild welfare services in compliance with all applicable federal and state laws, rules, \nregulations, and policies. \n179. DHHS must also file an annual report to the legislature on its oversight of \nlocal social services programs, including foster care. \n40\nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 35   Filed 03/06/23   Page 40 of 79\n\n180. Compliance with federal and state law requirements for children in foster \ncare include: \na. Making reasonable efforts, absent an immediate threat of harm, to \nprevent the removal of a child and need for placement elsewhere. See 42 \nU.S.C. § 671(a)(15)(B); 45 C.F.R. § 1356.21(b); N.C. Gen. Stat. § 7B-\n507; \nb. Making efforts to place children with relatives, nonrelative kin, former \nfoster parent(s), or other persons in the child’s home community. See 42 \nU.S.C. § 671(a)(29); N.C. Gen. Stat. § 7B-505; and \nc. Making arrangements for psychiatric, psychological, or mental health \ncare or treatment and psychotropic medications that are in the child’s \nbest interest. See 42 U.S.C. § 622(b)(15)(A); N.C. Gen. Stat. § 7B-\n505.1.       \n181. DHHS is also responsible for the oversight and regulation of all licensed \nfacilities throughout the state, including all PRTFs and other facilities providing care for \nchildren. N.C. Gen. Stat. § 122C-27. \n182. DHHS’s oversight responsibility includes inspecting PRTFs on at least an \nannual basis and whenever it otherwise deems inspection necessary.DHHS must also \nconduct unscheduled inspections of any facility subject to a complaint alleging the \nviolation of a PRTF licensing rule. And it must submit an annual report to the legislature \ndetailing compliance of each facility with laws and rules governing the use of restraints \nand seclusion, as well as facility deaths. \n41\nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 35   Filed 03/06/23   Page 41 of 79\n\n183. DHHS has authority to deny, suspend, amend, or revoke licenses of PRTFs; \ninvestigate allegations of harm occurring at PRTFs; inspect facilities; require regular \nreporting; impose financial penalties; limit or suspend admissions to PRTFs; remove \nchildren from PRTFs; and refuse to place children at PRTFs. \nVI. Defendant Discriminates Against Children with Disabilities in Foster Care \nby Unnecessarily Segregating Them in PRTFs \n184. The ADA recognizes that “society has tended to,” and problematically \n“continue[s] to,” “isolate and segregate individuals with disabilities.” 42 U.S.C. \n§ 12101(a)(2). Thus, regulations passed by Congress implementing Title II of the ADA \nrequire public entities to “administer services, programs, and activities in the most \nintegrated setting appropriate to the needs of qualified individuals with disabilities.” 28 \nC.F.R. § 35.130(d). According to the preamble discussion of the regulations, the “most \nintegrated setting” means “a setting that enables individuals with disabilities to interact \nwith nondisabled persons to the fullest extent possible.” 28 C.F.R. pt. 35, app. B. Public \nentities must also “make reasonable modifications in [their] policies, practices, or \nprocedures” to avoid disability-based discrimination. 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(7).  \n185. Regulations implementing Title II of the ADA further prohibit public \nentities from utilizing “criteria or methods of administration” “[t]hat have the effect of \nsubjecting qualified individuals with disabilities to discrimination” or “[t]hat have the \npurpose or effect of defeating or substantially impairing accomplishment of the \n42\nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 35   Filed 03/06/23   Page 42 of 79\n\nobjectives of the public entity’s program with respect to individuals with disabilities.” 28 \nC.F.R. § 35.130(b)(3); accord 45 C.F.R. § 84.4(b)(4) (Rehabilitation Act).  \n186. In the seminal decision Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581 (1999), the United \nStates Supreme Court held that unnecessary institutionalization can constitute unlawful \ndiscrimination under the ADA. Under Olmstead, states must provide community-based \ntreatment for individuals with disabilities when 1) such placement is appropriate, 2) the \naffected persons do not oppose such treatment, and 3) the placement can be reasonably \naccommodated, taking into account the resources available to the State and the needs of \nothers with disabilities. See id. at 607. Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § \n794, imposes identical requirements on programs and activities that receive federal \nfinancial assistance. See, e.g., 45 C.F.R. § 84.4(b)(2). \n187. Defendant has a pervasive, system-wide practice of unnecessarily \nsegregating children in its care in PRTF institutions instead of providing care and \nplacement for them in their communities. Defendant is discriminating against youth with \ndisabilities in foster care by administering and funding its child welfare programs and \nservices for these youth in a manner that results in their unnecessary institutionalization \nor serious risk of such institutionalization. By failing to provide placements, services, and \nsupports that enable youth with disabilities in foster care to remain in their own homes or \nin integrated family-like settings in the community, Defendant has violated Title II of the \nADA and its implementing regulations.  \n43\nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 35   Filed 03/06/23   Page 43 of 79\n\n188. DHHS and its county DSS agents are responsible for providing children in \nfoster care with a safe, appropriate home and for making arrangements for the appropriate \ncare and treatment of their mental health needs. \n189. According to state law, DHHS and its county DSS agents are specifically \nrequired to prioritize placement of children in foster care in the community, in families \nrather than in institutions. They also must provide them with community-based mental \nand behavioral health services.\n190. Instead, DHHS has an ongoing policy, practice, pattern, and/or custom of \ninappropriately and unnecessarily segregating children with disabilities in foster care in \nPRTFs, rather than placing them in integrated community-based placements with \nsupportive services.   \n191. Other youth in foster care with mental impairments are at serious risk of \nentering or returning to a PRTF because of DHHS’s systemic and pervasive failure to \nprovide adequate, appropriate community-based services, as well as its ongoing practices \nof unnecessarily segregating children in foster care in PRTFs and cycling children in \nfoster care through multiple PRTF placements.  \n192. DHHS also places a substantial number of youth with disabilities in foster \ncare in PRTFs located outside the state of North Carolina, far away from their families, \nexisting community supports, and the agencies responsible for ensuring their safety. A \nUSA TODAY Network investigation found that “abused and neglected children from \nNorth Carolina have been sent as far away as Utah, Missouri, Indiana and other states \neven when psychiatric facilities have been accused of physical and sexual abuse and \n44\nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 35   Filed 03/06/23   Page 44 of 79\n\nother mistreatment.” Further, USA TODAY reported that “[e]xperts say many families \n— often people of color who are struggling financially and living without reliable \ntransportation — cannot visit or check on the well-being of kids” when placed out of \nstate. \n193. As of November 2021, North Carolina officials report that approximately \n40% of youth placed in PRTFs were sent to facilities in other states over a one-year \nperiod. During North Carolina’s Fiscal Years 2018 to 2022, at least 726 Medicaid claims \nwere paid for North Carolina children in foster care in PRTFs located outside the state. \nNamed Plaintiff London R. is currently placed at a PRTF facility in South Carolina.  \n194. North Carolina has doubled-down on its overreliance of PRTFs. DHHS has \nincreased its reliance on PRTFs at a rate of 119% from 2010 to 2018. As of November \n2021, over 500 children involved with North Carolina’s child welfare system were placed \nin PRTFs over a one-year period, which is more than in previous years. \n195. According to an April 2021 report by a consultant group hired by DHHS, \n“DHHS staff shared their perception that there is an overreliance on residential services \nfor children with behavioral health needs, and that residential treatment facilities are \nviewed as a place for children to live, rather than as a level of treatment.” Further, \n“Division of Social Services (DSS) staff shared that children involved with the Child \nWelfare system sometimes remain in a PRTF long after a discharge plan is made because \nthere is no identified placement available for them.” The lack of appropriate community-\nbased placements affects foster children with disabilities across placements and \nthroughout the system: “DHHS also attributed the delay in discharges from state-run \n45\nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 35   Filed 03/06/23   Page 45 of 79\n\npsychiatric hospitals to the lack of community-based behavioral health services, requiring \npeople to wait in state hospital beds until the community services they needed became \navailable.” \n196. As the state’s consultant summarized to DHHS, “[i]t is important to note \nthat the state’s use of PRTFs has increased, and further work should be done to \nstrengthen access to community-based services to reduce out-of-home placements.” \n197. DHHS’s overreliance on congregate institutions is evidenced by its \nspending practices; more money is spent on PRTFs and other institutional care than on \ncommunity-based programs, even though DHHS admits that community-based programs \nare “better at improving kids’ lives.”\n198. In 2020, DHHS requested that the Technical Assistance Collaborative \n(“TAC”) provide an assessment of how DHHS serves people with disabilities. This \nconsultant’s report concluded that North Carolina spends a “disproportionate” amount of \nits resources on institutional settings and that “[a]dditional community-based service \noptions and capacity are needed for children . . . to reduce reliance on institutional and \ncongregate care settings.” \nA. Children with Disabilities in Child Welfare Custody Are Warehoused in \nRestrictive PRTFs and Exposed to Harmful, Non-Therapeutic Conditions   \n199. PRTFs are locked, segregated, institutional facilities that are populated \nexclusively with children with disabilities. They necessarily deprive the children within \ntheir walls of opportunities to interact with non-disabled peers in a community-based, \nintegrated setting.  \n46\nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 35   Filed 03/06/23   Page 46 of 79\n\n200. Aside from limited opportunities to receive visits from family and friends, \nchildren confined to PRTFs have few opportunities to interact with anyone without a \ndisability, other than staff.Children in PRTFs must attend on-site schools. As these on-\nsite schools contain only children with disabilities, they are not integrated with their \nnondisabled peers. They are also denied the option of participating in community-based \nactivities, such as recreation-league sports, dance classes, music lessons, part-time jobs, \nor school clubs. Instead, it is not uncommon for children’s opportunities for free play and \nfresh air to be time spent within the confines of razor-wire-surrounded recreation yards, \nand for limited periods of time. \n201. Daily life in a PRTF is typically regimented in a prison-like manner, \ndissimilar to life in the community and antithetical to healthy adolescent development. \nChildren generally share rooms with at least one other peer, have little designated \npersonal space, lack privacy, and are subject to invasive and traumatizing strip searches. \nFor instance, Named Plaintiff Timothy B. spends most of his time in the one common \nroom at the PRTF facility, has little-to-no privacy, and has nowhere to keep his personal \nbelongings. Additionally, children are subjected to rigid, non-individualized behavior \nmanagement practices, rather than practices tailored to the child’s individual needs and \ngoals. \n202. In addition to the harms of segregation, children placed in PRTFs \nexperience worse outcomes than their non-institutionalized peers. Social science research \nand evaluations of residential facilities and group homes have confirmed that youth \nplaced in residential facilities spend more time in foster care overall, are less likely to be \n47\nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 35   Filed 03/06/23   Page 47 of 79\n\nplaced with their siblings, and are less likely to be placed in or near their home \ncommunities. In addition, children placed in residential facilities are at risk of \nexperiencing maltreatment in care. Finally, children placed in these residential facilities \nare less likely to achieve permanency—a safe and legally permanent family—and \ntherefore are more likely to “age out” of the foster care system without community-based \nsupports to facilitate their successful transition to adulthood. Youth who age out of foster \ncare experience negative outcomes including lower educational achievement, early \nparenthood, homelessness, unemployment, and incarceration. \n203. Placement in PRTFs also prevents already traumatized children with \ndisabilities in foster care from forming meaningful relationships with “buffering” \nadults—trusted adults who serve to buffer and soothe a child’s physiological stress \nresponses. This lack of trusted adult supports can lead to toxic stress. Toxic stress, in \nturn, is associated with physical effects on children’s neural structures, compromised \nbrain development, and increased risk for stress-related disease and cognitive impairment \nwell into adult years. The availability of positive and stable supports is one of the most \nimportant factors in promoting resilience in traumatized children, but residential settings \nimpede the formation of these secure adult attachments. \n204. DHHS-licensed PRTFs in North Carolina are “treatment” facilities in name \nand definition. But in reality, they are typically highly restrictive, locked settings that are \nroutinely dangerous, distressing, and harmful.Their dire conditions often traumatize \nchildren rather than treat them.  \n48\nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 35   Filed 03/06/23   Page 48 of 79\n\n205. USA Today, the Fayetteville Observer, and the Charlotte Observer have all \nrecently reported on the abusive conditions North Carolina children experience in PRTFs. \n206. As the lead investigator for the North Carolina “Locked Away” \ninvestigation publicly explained: \nWhat we see over and over in state records and in interviews with kids is that \nkids will get choked, kids will have bones broken, kids will be bruised. They \nwill have elbows and shoulders sprained as workers try to bring them under \ncontrol and there are definitely some cases that are just gross, including, the \nreport that a 15-year-old boy was repeatedly punched in the face by a worker \nand ended up with a broken eye socket and was not taken to the hospital for \nfour days. \n207. Details about the conditions children experience in PRTFs are known to \nDHHS through the work of its DHSR division, which oversees the services provided in \nPRTFs on behalf of DHHS and publishes public reports of its investigations on its \nwebsite through documents known as Statements of Deficiency. Recent examples, within \nthe last four years, of the harm and abuse children experience at taxpayer-funded PRTFs \ninclude: improper physical restraints;inappropriate chemical restraints; inappropriate use \nof psychotropic medication;inhumane living conditions; and sexual,emotional, and \npsychological abuse,including racial and homophobic slurs. \n208. Upon information and belief, inappropriate and harmful physical restraints \nare used often by staff in PRTFs, thereby severely limiting the physical liberty of children \nwith disabilities in child welfare custody and routinely injuring them. Inappropriate \nphysical restraints can be dangerous, even deadly. After someone died from the use of a \n“prone” facedown restraint at a DHHS-operated facility in 2012, then-DHHS Secretary \nAlbert Delia ordered that North Carolina providers cease use of prone restraints. These \n49\nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 35   Filed 03/06/23   Page 49 of 79\n\nrestraints are the same type of restraint that killed 16-year-old Cornelius Frederick in \n2020 while confined to a Michigan foster care facility and the same type of restraint that \nkilled George Floyd. This restraint is also known to be disproportionately used on people \nof color and people with disabilities. \n209. Chemical restraints have been inappropriately administered in PRTFs to \nmanage a child’s behavior and/or sedate them. Chemical restraints are restraints \nadministered through chemical means, such as injections of sedatives or psychotropic \nmedications. Just like a physical restraint, a chemical restraint severely limits the physical \nliberty of children with disabilities in child welfare custody and has the potential to cause \nPTSD, flashbacks, nightmares, and intrusive thoughts. Chemical restraints should be used \nas a last resort and with proper oversight from medical professionals – not for \npunishment, discipline, or staff convenience. \n210. DHHS admits that it does not conduct “any monitoring or auditing” of \nPRTFs’ adherence to the state’s psychotropic medication policies. \n211. Additionally, PRTFs housing youth with disabilities in child welfare \ncustody rely on cocktails of powerful psychotropic medications to control children’s \nbehavior, again severely limiting the physical liberty of children in child welfare custody \nand frequently harming them. Psychotropic medications are powerful drugs used to alter \na person’s mood, cognition, and/or behaviors. There are serious, sometimes irreversible, \nadverse effects associated with the improper administration of psychotropic drugs, \nincluding: obesity, diabetes, suicidal ideation, uncontrollable movements such as tics or \n50\nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 35   Filed 03/06/23   Page 50 of 79\n\ntremors, seizures, irreversible movement disorders (such as tardive dyskinesia), and \nthyroid and pancreas damage.   \n212. Children with disabilities in foster care are particularly vulnerable to these \nserious harms associated with psychotropic medications. The U.S. Department of Health \nand Human Services’ Office of Inspector General (“OIG”) explained that, “[u]nlike \nchildren from intact families, children in foster care often do not have a consistent \ninterested party to coordinate treatment planning or to provide continuous oversight of \ntheir mental health treatment. Further, responsibility for children in foster care is shared \namong multiple people—foster parents, birth parents, and caseworkers—which creates \nrisk of miscommunication, conflict, and lack of follow-up. Children in foster care may \nalso experience multiple changes in placement and in physicians, which can cause health \ninformation about these children to be incomplete and spread across many sources. \nTherefore, children in foster care may be at risk for inappropriate prescribing practices \n(e.g., too many medications, incorrect dosage, incorrect duration, incorrect indications for \nuse, or inappropriate treatment).” \n213. Hence, the 2015 American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry \n(“AACAP”) recommendations, as well as guidance from the federal Administration for \nChildren and Families (“ACF”) and professional organizations, call for collaboration \nbetween child welfare agencies, Medicaid agencies, and mental health agencies to \neffectively monitor the safe administration of psychotropic medication to children with \ndisabilities in foster care. In particular, AACAP calls for the systemic capacity to identify \n“red flag criteria triggering external reviews” and for “[m]andatory consultations with an \n51\nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 35   Filed 03/06/23   Page 51 of 79\n\nidentified child and adolescent reviewer” in response to such red flags. ACF guidance \nsimilarly calls for systems designed to flag outlier prescriptions, including “instances \nwhere children are prescribed too many psychotropic medications, too much medication, \nor at too young an age: too many, and too much, too young.” \n214. Without this necessary oversight by DHHS, PRTFs commonly subject \nchildren with disabilities in foster care to inappropriate, outlier prescribing practices, such \nas polypharmacy – the concurrent prescription of multiple psychotropic medications to \nchildren. Each of the Named Plaintiffs is currently subject to polypharmacy within \nPRTFs.  \n215. Additionally, the following illustrations of conditions within various \nDHHS-licensed PRTFs within the last four years underscore the dire situations to which \nDHHS regularly – and knowingly – exposes children with disabilities in foster care, \nrather than placing them in community-based settings. \n216. At Jackson Springs Treatment Center in West End, some of the children did \nnot have functioning, hygienic bathroom facilities, and all of the facilities were generally \nrun-down and in need of repairs. Sinks did not have handles on faucets and/or were not in \nworking order, showers and bathtubs did not have shower curtains or other options for \nprivacy, the bathrooms smelled strongly of mold and mold was visible throughout. The \nPRTF advertises its “safe, coercive free residential environment.” But according to \nDHSR reports staff restrained children by holding them with their faces “on the wall”; \nhurt them by pulling their arms too far back and continuing to do so after children said \nthey were in pain; and, on one occasion, restrained a child with a cast on his arm. One \n52\nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 35   Filed 03/06/23   Page 52 of 79\n\nchild suffered an orbital bone fracture and black eye at the hands of PRTF staff (the child \nreported being punched in the face by staff while the staff member claimed the child fell \nafter he failed to properly restrain the child). After the injury, the PRTF did not send the \nchild to the hospital or coordinate medical treatment or, upon information and belief, \ntrain the staff on proper restraint procedures.Facility staff contacted law enforcement at \nleast 42 times over the course of the year, often without taking any steps to address the \nchild’s behavior before involving law enforcement. As of the filing of this complaint, \nDHHS continues to send children in foster care to Jackson Springs Treatment Center. \n217. At Canyon Hills Treatment Facility in Raeford, whose slogan is “giving \nchildren back their childhood,” an eight-year-old child reported that staff “beat on the \nboys.” A nurse confirmed that staff “slap them up and slap them around – on the butt and \nbottom,” and another nurse reported witnessing staff choke a child. A nine-year-old with \nbruises and abrasions across his body reported that a staff member had grabbed him by \nthe shoulder, rubbed spit across his face, and kicked him in the groin. Parents reported \nthat their child was bruised so badly he “looked like he had been through a war zone.” At \none point, at least one-third of the children lost weight during their stay, and the children \nbegan circulating a unanimously signed petition for larger portions and better food.In \nresponse, the PRTF reduced the children’s food portions as punishment.One child \nreported that a nurse said the PRTF intentionally gave them “a little bit of food” because \n“your stomach will shrink and then you will not be hungry.” A child reported that they \nwere sexually molested while at the PRTF. And staff mocked and harassed children with \nhomophobic terms, calling at least one child a “f-g-ot.” According to a news article by \n53\nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 35   Filed 03/06/23   Page 53 of 79\n\nthe Charlotte Observer, Canyon Hills employees were “resistant and uncooperative” with \npolice and child protective services’ attempts to speak with children and staff at the \nfacility and refused to allow them to speak with the child who reported the sexual abuse. \nAs of the filing of this complaint, DHHS continues to send children in foster care to \nCanyon Hills Treatment Facility. \n218. At Carolina Dunes Behavioral Health in Leland (formerly Strategic \nBehavioral Center), whose mission is to “Improve the Lives We Touch,” a 12-year-old \nboy less than five feet tall and weighing 94 pounds had his wrist fractured by a 6’6” tall, \n200-pound staff member pressing a door against him. Staff did not report the child’s \ninjury, and a nurse did not examine his wrist when the child first reported it; it was four \ndays before the child was taken to the hospital to stabilize the fracture. Another staff \nmember injured a 13-year-old child so badly that they had to go to the emergency room. \nAnd after a staff was observed kissing a 14-year-old child at the PRTF, the staff admitted \nto inappropriate sexual contact with the child and to not reporting the incident. The child, \nwho was known to self-harm, told DHHS investigators she was in a romantic relationship \nwith the staff member and that she had been sabotaging her treatment to spend more time \nwith the staff. The girl’s therapist described the staff member as a “predator who was \ngrooming a 14-year-old.” Additionally, children’s bathrooms were found to be damaged \nand dirty, and some were nonfunctional. There have been numerous medication errors: \nstaff failed to administer medications as ordered by the physician; medication was \nadministered despite there being no order for it; powerful medications were not \nadministered because the facility ran out of it; and documentation failures further \n54\nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 35   Filed 03/06/23   Page 54 of 79\n\ncomplicated determinations as to whether medications were actually administered and in \nwhat doses. For example, staff administered the antipsychotic Seroquel numerous times \non a single day to a 17-year-old child and later, on a different day, ordered multiple \ndosages of Seroquel without any documentation of these administrations. Staff also have \nfailed to properly document the use of medications used as chemical restraints, such as \nthe antipsychotic Thorazine. A child reported that the staff kept “giving me needle \ninjections,” a chemical restraint, while also being secluded. Staff are also known to use \nmultiple chemical restraints or use them after physical restraints already have been \nattempted. As of the filing of this complaint, DHHS continues to send children in foster \ncare to Carolina Dunes Behavioral Health. \n219. At Hope Gardens Treatment Center in Raeford, where the “team focuses on \nproviding high-quality compassionate behavioral healthcare by utilizing evidenced-based \npractices, and rendering exclusive therapeutic residential treatment methods in a safe, \ncaring environment,” a staff member reported seeing another staff slap a child across the \nface and place his hands around the child’s neck. A police report from the incident stated \nthe child “exhibited difficulty to speak” and was overheard screaming “stop choking me.” \nA few days later, the same staff member called another child the n-word and “a f-g-ot”\nand told the child “[t]he only reason you are here is because your parents don’t love you.” \nStaff members have reportedly called the children in their care “dogs” and referred to \ntheir rooms as “dog kennels.” In one incident, a staff member “came to work in a bad \nmood” and told everybody “not to provoke him”; after one of the residents irritated the \nstaff member, the staff member was seen going into the child’s room, after which others \n55\nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 35   Filed 03/06/23   Page 55 of 79\n\nheard loud banging noises, the child screaming in pain, yelling and cursing back and \nforth, the child warning the staff member they would bite, and the staff member \nscreaming. Other staff members ran into the room to physically pull the staff member off \nthe resident and pled with the staff member to remember that the resident was “only a \nlittle kid.” As of the filing of this complaint, DHHS continues to send children in foster \ncare to Hope Gardens Treatment Center.  \n220. NOVA Behavioral Healthcare in Kinston, which advertises that its \n“compliment of Residential Managers and Residential Supervisors provide basic and \nclinical oversight and ensure a safe and homelike living environment,” previously was \ncited for failing to ensure that at least two direct-care staff were present for every six \nchildren, in violation of state staffing regulations designed to protect youth. In 2021, a \nfemale client at Nova’s Maplewood unit tied an electrical cord around her neck, yet the \nfacility determined this incident did not result in a threat to her health or safety and did \nnot report it as required. Similarly, a 17-year-old girl in the Oakwood unit with a \ndocumented history of self-harm, suicidal ideation, and suicide attempts “was found \nsitting on the floor of the bathroom with shoestrings tied around her neck and to the \ncrossbar of the stall doors.” There were neither goals nor strategies in the child’s \ntreatment plan to address her suicidal behaviors and ideation, nor sufficient supervision to \nprevent her from harming herself. Finally, when a child in the Oakwood unit threw milk, \na staff member threw it back at her and gave the child’s food to other children as \npunishment. The child became upset, and the staff member reacted by restraining the \nchild. The staff pulled the child’s head down by her braids and shoved her face into a \n56\nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 35   Filed 03/06/23   Page 56 of 79\n\npillow, even though this type of life-threatening prone restraint was forbidden by DHHS \nover ten years ago. The staff member then initiated a restraint known as “the wrap,” but \nrestrained the child by the knees – rather than by the ankles as required by policy – and \nhurt the child by digging her fingernails into the child’s skin.The staff member was told \nto “leave the situation alone” and “to tap out” but refused to disengage. As of the filing of \nthis complaint, DHHS continues to send children in foster care to NOVA Behavioral \nHealthcare.  \n221. At Anderson Health Services in Marshville, staff implemented a \npsychologically-abusive punishment resembling solitary confinement called “Loss of \nPrivileges” (LOP). A child on LOP was confined to their bedroom for as long as 30 days, \nwith only 15-to-30-minute walks outside. There were no policies or procedures for the \nuse of LOP, and staff were implementing the punishment with virtually no clinical \noversight. A volunteer with little-to-no clinical qualifications was “second in charge of \nthe facility and responsible for multiple administrative positions including but not limited \nto corporate compliance, intake documentation and supervision.” A nurse practitioner and \ntwo registered nurses responsible for all medications at the facility failed to ensure \ndiscontinued medications were stored or properly disposed of. A nurse admitted to failing \nto lock the door to the medication room “because it was a pain in the ‘a*s’” to do so. As a \nresult, 29 pills of Vyvanse (an amphetamine) went missing, and the facility could not \ndetermine if staff or children had removed the Vyvanse from the medication room. In \nanother instance, a registered nurse administered Zoloft (a selective serotonin reuptake \ninhibitor used to treat mental health disorders) and Metformin (an anti-diabetic \n57\nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 35   Filed 03/06/23   Page 57 of 79\n\nmedication) to the wrong client, who then had to be monitored for hypoglycemic \nepisodes. A child reported that a therapist at the facility sexually touched him during a \nprivate therapy session; the therapist was suspended, but it is not clear whether any \nfurther action was taken. DHHS suspended Anderson’s license on June 1, 2018, but \npermitted the facility to reopen in 2021 under new management. As of the filing of this \ncomplaint, DHHS continues to send children in foster care to Anderson Health Services.  \n222. The PRTFs used by DHHS to house children with disabilities in foster care \nare not therapeutic environments. All children in foster care suffer the trauma of being \nremoved from their family homes, in addition to any trauma relating to the circumstances \nof their removal. Unsurprisingly, children in foster care frequently have complex trauma \nhistories, including traumas experienced after removal while in foster care. Children in \nfoster care are likely to experience more trauma, not less at a PRTF, yet DHHS continues \nto place children with disabilities in these facilities.  \n223. In commenting on the inappropriate overuse of traumatizing psychiatric \nfacilities for children in North Carolina, a state representative recently explained that “we \nare ruining people’s lives, and we’re doing it in the most expensive way possible. . . . It’s \ninhumane and irresponsible. It is a government failure.”   \n58\nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 35   Filed 03/06/23   Page 58 of 79\n\nB. Black and Brown Children Bear the Brunt of DHHS’s Service System Design, \nFunding Choices, and Service Implementation Failures That Promote or Rely \non the Unnecessary Segregation of Children with Disabilities in Foster Care \nin PRTFs  \n224. Children of color, such as Named Plaintiffs Flora P., Steph C., and London \nR., are disproportionately affected by the harms associated with DHHS’s overreliance on \nPRTFs. \n225. Black and Brown children are disproportionately represented in the \nnumbers of children in foster care in North Carolina, and are again disproportionately \nrepresented in the numbers of children in foster care placed in a PRTF by DHHS.  \n226. The disproportionality rate of children in foster care refers to the number of \nyouth in care compared to the number of youth in the general population. Based on 2019 \ndata from Child Trends, the disproportionality rate in North Carolina for Black/African \nAmerican children in foster care in 2019 was 1.34, and the rate for multiracial children \nwas 1.5. \n227. In Mecklenburg County, one of the largest counties in North Carolina, \nchildren of color and Hispanic/Latinx children make up 63% of the population but \naccount for 88% of abuse or neglect reports made to Youth and Family Services (YFS). \nMecklenburg County YFS has admittedly “not relieved or exacerbated this disparity, \nwhich highlights the powerful downstream effects that disparate initial child welfare \ncontact” can have. This “downstream effect” includes Black and Brown children in foster \ncare bearing an undue and disparate harm from their unnecessary placement in PRTFs.  \n59\nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 35   Filed 03/06/23   Page 59 of 79\n\n228. Public news articles in late 2021 reported that while Black children in \nNorth Carolina make up about 13% of children (not specific to the foster care \npopulation), they make up about 30% of Medicaid recipients within PRTFs.  \n229. One article noted that PRTFs may be inappropriately used as a placement \nfor Black children with milder, misunderstood, or misinterpreted symptoms. \n230. The disproportionate use of foster care and unnecessary PRTFs by DHHS \nimposes unjust and grave harm on Black children with disabilities in foster care. \nC. DHHS’s Known Methods of Funding and Administering Its Programs Result \nin Unlawful and Unnecessary Segregation of Children with Disabilities in \nFoster Care in PRTFs   \n231. Defendant has a pattern, custom, policy, and/or practice of funding and \nadministering its programs in a manner and through methods that result in the \nunnecessary segregation of children with disabilities in foster care by failing to plan for, \ndevelop, operate, and fund a sufficient array of community-based placements and \nsupportive mental and behavioral health services for children with disabilities in foster \ncare and their caregivers that would allow them to live in integrated settings. \n232. These criteria or methods of administration include: grossly disparate \nfunding of PRTFs rather than community-based placements and supportive mental and \nbehavioral health services; failing to expand community-based foster care placements, \nincluding kinship and “fictive” kinship placements and therapeutic foster care; and failing \nto expand access to and maintaining waitlists and/or shortages of community-based \nintensive in-home services, community-based wrap-around services, community-based \n60\nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 35   Filed 03/06/23   Page 60 of 79\n\ncrisis intervention services, and community-based outpatient mental and behavioral \nhealth services. \n233. The purpose and philosophy behind North Carolina’s child welfare services \nis to provide family-centered services and serve children in their homes and communities.  \n234. Yet DHHS has a policy, pattern, custom, and/or practice of unnecessarily \nplacing children in foster care with disabilities at PRTFs, which by definition provide \nnon-acute and time-limited care, and forcing those children to remain in these facilities \nlong-term when they can and should be served in the community.  \n235. This policy, pattern, custom, and/or practice persists because DHHS has \nfailed to make adequate community-based placements and services available.\n236. According to 2020 state data, less than 1% of North Carolina children are in \nfoster care, but foster youth account for almost half of the children residing in PRTFs, \nplaced there by DHHS. \n237. DHHS’s “Division of Social Services (DSS) staff shared that children \ninvolved with the Child Welfare system sometimes remain in a PRTF long after a \ndischarge plan is made because there is no identified placement available for them.” \n238. Children in child welfare custody are admitted to PRTFs despite being \nappropriate for lower levels of care, remain in the facility longer than children who are \nnot in child welfare custody, often are laterally “discharged” to another PRTF, and \nexperience more frequent readmissions to PRTFs.  \n239. DHHS also maintains a pattern, policy, custom, and/or practice of \nauthorizing significant numbers of children to be sent to out-of-state PRTFs, which \n61\nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 35   Filed 03/06/23   Page 61 of 79\n\nisolates children who could be served and accommodated in their communities even \nfurther from their home communities, families, and peers.   \n240. Not only do DHHS’s practices violate the rights of children to live and be \nserved in the community, they also waste taxpayer’s money. DHHS spends at least \nhundreds of dollars per day per child in a PRTF,and it pays more than $100 million \nannually to institutionalize children in PRTFs.\n241. DHHS could, but has failed to, expand community-based placements and \nsupportive mental and behavioral health services for children with disabilities in child \nwelfare custody. \n242. DHHS admits that North Carolina has a “limited array of available \ncommunity-based services across the state to support children remaining in family \nsettings or the least restrictive setting possible.” It acknowledges that this shortage is \ncausing its recent “[c]hallenges meeting the needs of children/youth in foster care with \ncomplex . . . behavioral health . . .  or [intellectual/developmental disability] needs, \nresulting in restrictive residential or out-of-state placements.” \n243. Although the rate of children in foster care has increased from around \n10,000 youth in 2017 to over 11,000 youth in 2021, DHHS has not expanded the number \nof community-based placements available for these youth. Instead, the number of \nfamilies and children receiving in-home services has steadily declined. Moreover, the \nnumber of licensed foster families is dwindling, dropping from 7,100 to 6,500 as of June \n2022. For example, in Cumberland County, licensed foster homes decreased from 111 in \n62\nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 35   Filed 03/06/23   Page 62 of 79\n\n2018 to only 54 in 2021. The lack of foster family homes is a significant driver of \nchildren’s being unnecessarily placed in PRTFs. \n244. DHHS needs to expand community-based foster care placements, including \nkinship and “fictive” kinship placements. According to DHHS’s federal reporting, “data \non the use of congregate care suggest North Carolina lacks an adequate supply of family \nfoster homes in at least some counties and regions.” A recent survey found that the most \ncommon reason for placement in congregate care “was the lack of an available family \nfoster home.” \n245. It was reported that from 2019 to 2020, less than a third of children \ndischarged from a PRTF transitioned to a community-based program, and some were \nlaterally discharged to another PRTF. \n246. As DHHS describes it, its child welfare services are an insufficient and \ndisparate patchwork of services for the traumatized children that DHHS must protect and \nprovide treatment for.  \n247. According to one DHHS official in September 2022, North Carolina’s child \nwelfare system “is in crisis.” The same DHHS official publicly admitted that the state \ncould be sued at any time because of its systemic lack of appropriate placements for \nchildren in foster care. \n248. On any given day, the state averages about 50 children with emotional and \nbehavioral health needs “who have been discharged [from emergency rooms], but their \nappropriate level of placement has not been located.” According to recent state data, due \nto the lack of appropriate placements and services, at least “dozens” of children in foster \n63\nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 35   Filed 03/06/23   Page 63 of 79\n\ncare end up “sleeping in hospital emergency rooms, in county departments of social \nservices offices or local hotel rooms” each week. Moreover, the lack of community-based \nservices puts children with disabilities in foster care at risk for placement in PRTFs. \nD. Community-Based Services and Placements Should Be Used When \nAppropriate for Children with Disabilities in Foster Care, but DHHS Fails to \nPrioritize Integrated Services \n249. Living in inappropriate settings further traumatizes children in foster care. \nAccording to DHHS’s own 2022 report, “[t]he longer children are separated from their \nfamilies, the less likely they are to be reunified with them, and they run a higher risk of \nexperiencing poor health and social outcomes, including homelessness and involvement \nwith the justice system. \n250. The current institutional reality of day-to-day child welfare practices stands \nin stark contrast to DHHS’s policy that “[i]nstitutional placement should be a rare \nexception and there must be clear and convincing habilitative, physical, and/or clinical \nreasons to support the placement.” \n251. The lack of community-based mental and behavioral health services, \ncoupled with frequent placement disruptions resulting from a lack of these services, \nplaces children with disabilities in foster care at serious risk for placement, and/or \nextended stays, in PRTFs, and for lengthy and repeat stays in PRTFs. \n252. The federal government published a report showing that children placed in, \nor at serious risk for placement in, PRTFs can be served more effectively and at a much \nlower cost in the community. \n64\nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 35   Filed 03/06/23   Page 64 of 79\n\n253. DHHS knows that evidence-based wraparound services in the community \nare effective and help children such as Timothy B., Flora P., Isabella A., Steph C., and \nLondon R. DHHS states that “[t]his intensive program has been shown to keep more \nchildren in their homes, preventing the need for facility-based or residential care.” It also \nwould save the state an estimated $33,000 per child served via high-fidelity wraparound \nservices instead of via a PRTF placement. \n254. National data also support the provision of evidenced-based wraparound \nand other community-based services, showing that children do not have better outcomes \nin PRTFs and “do not appear to gain greater benefit from [congregate] treatment relative \nto peers with similar risk profiles but treated in family settings.” \n255. According to state data, while North Carolina Medicaid offers high-fidelity \nwraparound services – an evidence-based care management program for children with \nmental health challenges that has been shown to keep children in their homes and prevent \nthe need for facility-based or residential care – these services are offered in only 33 out of \nthe 100 counties in North Carolina, and DHHS admits more funding is needed to expand \nthese services across the entire state. \n256. According to a 2021 DHHS study, one roadblock to community-based \nservices for children with disabilities in foster care is a shortage of sufficient qualified \nservice providers. “Too many community-based service providers do not have the skills \nnecessary or incentives to serve individuals with complex needs or challenging behaviors, \nleaving state-operated facilities and costly, out-of-state psychiatric residential treatment \nfacilities (PRTFs) as the only options for services for these individuals.” \n65\nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 35   Filed 03/06/23   Page 65 of 79\n\n257. It would not effect a fundamental alteration to North Carolina’s child \nwelfare system if DHHS and its agents were ordered to make arrangements to expand \ncommunity-based services and placements for children with mental impairments in child \nwelfare custody.  \n258. DHHS recently stated in 2022 that it “can build upon existing effective and \ninnovative supports scattered across our state with targeted, ongoing investments to \nprovide coordinated, consistent services that deliver better outcomes for children, \nfamilies, and the state.” \n259. In the same report, DHHS described its child welfare and behavioral health \nservices as a patchwork of uneven support across the state. DHHS admits that children \nwith complex behavioral health needs in the care of child welfare services require \nDHHS’s “immediate attention through better coordination and increased resources for \nservices that close gaps in care.” \n260. DHHS has also acknowledged its problem with waitlists for services. \nDefendant Kinsley recently noted that a “core factor that drives a lot of these waitlists . . . \nis our vacancy rate” for employees. The Department’s employee vacancy rate has \ndoubled since the COVID-19 pandemic, reaching over 23% as of July 2022. That \nincludes a 42% rate, or 46 vacancies, for psychologists, and a 44% rate, or 68 vacancies, \nfor clinical social workers. According to Defendant Kinsley, the “situation means \nincreased waitlists, increased time on waitlists, increased need for services, and fewer \npeople served.” \n66\nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 35   Filed 03/06/23   Page 66 of 79\n\n261. Through its Medicaid program, in which all Named Plaintiffs and putative \nclass members are enrolled, DHHS facially offers community-based services and \nplacements to children with disabilities in foster care, but it has not made these services \navailable to all youth who need them. As a result, children with disabilities in foster care \nare forced into PRTFs, in violation of their rights under the ADA and Rehabilitation Act.  \n262. For example, according to state data, although North Carolina Medicaid \noffers care management services, which consist of a facilitator-led team and supports for \nthe family and child to help reach agreed-upon goals, less than 50% of children in North \nCarolina’s foster care system access these services. \n263. Data collected during a focus group to review in-home mental and \nbehavioral health services as part of DHHS’s 2022 reporting to the federal \nAdministration on Children identified numerous systemic issues barring access to \nservices. These barriers include a limited number of available services, poor quality \nservices, poor accessibility of services, need for more flexible services, transportation \nbarriers, lack of funding for programs, and waitlists. \n264. DHHS’s 2022 federal reporting also stated “that there are significant \nsystemic barriers to families’ accessing services. The most commonly cited barriers were \nlimited services or no available services, transportation to services, and youth having a \ndual diagnosis of mental health and substance use issues.” \n265. Mobile crisis services provide in-person and virtual support within an hour \nof being called when a child is in crisis and connect a child with necessary clinical and \nsocial services. North Carolina recognized and admitted in 2022 that expansion of such \n67\nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 35   Filed 03/06/23   Page 67 of 79\n\nservices would keep children out of restrictive residential settings and connect them more \nrapidly to community-based services. However, according to state data, North Carolina’s \n“MORES” in-person and virtual Crisis Intervention Teams for youth experiencing mental \nhealth crises is offered in only a fraction of counties in the state. \n266. All of the above methods of DHHS’s administration of its programs, \nindividually and collectively, cause in significant part the unnecessary institutionalization \nand segregation of children with disabilities in foster care in PRTFs. \nCAUSES OF ACTION \nFIRST CAUSE OF ACTION: \nDISCRIMINATION IN VIOLATION OF THE AMERICANS WITH \nDISABILITIES ACT (“ADA”), 42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq. \n(Asserted on behalf of Plaintiffs DRNC and NC NAACP, the Named Plaintiffs, and \nthe putative class against Defendant Kinsley in his official capacity) \n267. Plaintiffs incorporate by reference each and every allegation contained in \nthe foregoing paragraphs as if specifically alleged herein. \n268. Title II of the ADA requires, inter alia, that “no qualified individual with a \ndisability shall, by reason of such disability, be excluded from participation in or be \ndenied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities of a public entity, or be \nsubjected to discrimination by any such entity.” See 42 U.S.C. § 12132. \n269. DHHS is a “public entity” as used in Title II of the ADA. See 42 U.S.C. \n§ 12131(1)(B). Defendant, acting in his official capacity, is a public entity as defined by \nthe ADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12131, and its implementing regulations, 28 C.F.R. § 35.104. As \nsuch, the ADA prohibits Defendant from discriminating against individuals with \n68\nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 35   Filed 03/06/23   Page 68 of 79\n\ndisabilities in its programs and services. See 42 U.S.C. § 12132. Further, Defendant’s \nunnecessary segregation of individuals with disabilities constitutes unlawful \ndiscrimination under Title II of the ADA. Olmstead v. L.C. ex rel. Zimring, 527 U.S. 581, \n600 (1999). \n270. The Named Plaintiffs and the putative class are qualified individuals with \ndisabilities entitled to the protections of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12131, and its \nimplementing regulations, 28 C.F.R. § 35.104.  \n271. Child welfare services, including foster care, the North Carolina Medicaid \nprogram, state-funded disability services, and oversight of PRTFs, are services, \nprograms, or activities of Defendant, a public entity.  \n272. The Named Plaintiffs and the putative class are otherwise qualified \nindividuals with disabilities for purposes of these services, programs, or activities of \nDefendant.   \n273. Title II contains an “integration mandate” requiring public entities to \n“administer services, programs, and activities in the most integrated setting appropriate to \nthe needs of qualified individuals with disabilities.” 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(d). \n274. DHHS and its agents institutionalized the Named Plaintiffs and the putative \nclass in PRTFs, or have acted or failed to act in a manner that puts the Named Plaintiffs \nand the putative class at serious risk for institutionalization in a PRTF, a wholly \nsegregated setting, in violation of the integration mandate.  \n275. Title II further provides that public entities may not “[a]fford a qualified \nindividual with a disability an opportunity to participate in or benefit from the aid, \n69\nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 35   Filed 03/06/23   Page 69 of 79\n\nbenefit, or service that is” either “not equal to that afforded others” or “not as effective in \naffording equal opportunity” to gain the same result or benefit as provided to others. See\n28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(1)(ii)-(iii). \n276. Title II of the ADA requires public entities to make reasonable \nmodifications to their child welfare programs to avoid discrimination on the basis of \ndisability. See 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(7).   \n277. As children in child welfare custody, the Named Plaintiffs and the putative \nclass are categorically eligible for Medicaid and are presumed eligible, based on \ndisability, for DHHS’s publicly-funded mental health services, and such community-\nbased services already exist. Defendant has not made reasonable modifications, to the \nextent any are necessary, to provide the Named Plaintiffs and the putative class access to \nthese community-based child welfare services and integrated placements.   \n278. Public entities cannot use criteria or methods of administration that \ndiscriminate on the basis of disability. See 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b).   \n279. Defendant has a policy and practice of discriminating against the Named \nPlaintiffs and the putative class based on disability by relying on criteria or methods of \nadministration in its child welfare services that prioritize or permit placement of the \nNamed Plaintiffs and the putative class in institutions based on their disability and need \nfor services, even though home and community-based placements and services are \navailable and are being provided to other children with the same diagnoses. These criteria \nor methods of administration include: grossly disparate funding of PRTFs rather than \ncommunity-based placements and supportive mental and behavioral health services; \n70\nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 35   Filed 03/06/23   Page 70 of 79\n\nfailing to expand community-based foster care placements, including kinship and \n“fictive” kinship placements and therapeutic foster care; and failing to expand access to, \nmaintaining waitlists for, and/or permitting shortages of community-based intensive in-\nhome services, community-based wrap-around services, community-based crisis \nintervention services, and community-based outpatient mental and behavioral health \nservices.    \n280. Defendant has a policy and practice of planning, administering, and funding \nits child welfare system in a manner that unnecessarily segregates children with \ndisabilities in PRTFs. As a result, children with disabilities in the custody of child welfare \nagencies are needlessly segregated or at serious risk of unnecessary segregation. \n281. The Named Plaintiffs and the putative class do not oppose community-\nbased treatment and placement.  \n282. An integrated setting is appropriate for the Named Plaintiffs and the \nputative class. Other children with the same diagnoses and/or similar needs are receiving \nservices in integrated settings and live in community-based integrated placements. \n283. As a result of Defendant’s actions and inactions, the Named Plaintiffs and \nthe putative class have suffered and will continue to suffer irreparable harm: they have \nsuffered and will continue to suffer from discrimination, unnecessary institutionalization, \nand inability to access community-based mental health services and other supports while \nin the custody of child welfare agents, deprivation of adults with whom they can form \nhealthy attachments, the known harms of exposure to congregate care placement, and \ninjury to their prospects for lifelong success and prosperity. \n71\nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 35   Filed 03/06/23   Page 71 of 79\n\n284. In the absence of declaratory and injunctive relief, Defendant will continue \nto institutionalize and deny Plaintiffs their right to live in the most integrated setting \nappropriate to their needs.  \nSECOND CAUSE OF ACTION:  \nDISCRIMINATION IN VIOLATION OF SECTION 504 OF THE \nREHABILITATION ACT, 29 U.S.C. § 794  \n(Asserted on behalf of Plaintiffs DRNC and NC NAACP, the Named Plaintiffs, and \nthe putative class against Defendant Kinsley in his official capacity) \n285. Plaintiffs incorporate by reference all allegations contained in the preceding \nparagraphs, as if alleged herein. \n286. Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act mandates that “[n]o otherwise \nqualified individual with a disability . . . shall, solely by reason of her or his disability, be \nexcluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to \ndiscrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.” 29 \nU.S.C. § 794(a). \n287. The Named Plaintiffs and the putative class are otherwise qualified \nindividuals with disabilities entitled to the protections of the Rehabilitation Act. See 29 \nU.S.C. § 705(20)(B) (citing to the ADA’s definition at 42 U.S.C. § 12102). \n288. The Rehabilitation Act defines a “program or activity,” in pertinent part, as \n“all of the operations of a department [or] agency . . . of a State or of a local \ngovernment.” 29 U.S.C. § 794(b)(1). \n289. DHHS is a governmental agency that receives “federal financial assistance” \nas used in the Rehabilitation Act and operates programs or activities within the meaning \n72\nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 35   Filed 03/06/23   Page 72 of 79\n\nof Section 504. See 29 U.S.C. § 794(b)(1)(A). Defendant, acting in his official capacity, \nadministers programs or activities as defined by the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § \n794(b), and its implementing regulations, 28 C.F.R. § 41.51.   \n290. Child welfare services, including foster care, the North Carolina Medicaid \nprogram, state-funded disability services, and oversight of PRTFs, are programs or \nactivities of Defendant.  \n291. The Rehabilitation Act contains an “integration mandate” requiring covered \nentities to provide aids, benefits, and services that afford people with disabilities “equal \nopportunity to obtain the same result, to gain the same benefit, or to reach the same level \nof achievement, in the most integrated setting appropriate to the person’s needs.” 45 \nC.F.R. § 84.4(b)(2). \n292. DHHS’s agents have placed the Named Plaintiffs and the putative class in \nPRTFs and/or have acted or failed to act in a manner that puts the Named Plaintiffs and \nthe putative class at serious risk for placement in a PRTF, a wholly segregated placement \nthat is not as effective as community-based behavioral and mental health treatment, \ndenies children adequate social-emotional caregiver-child interactions, and is likely to \nlead to less positive outcomes for the Named Plaintiffs and the putative class than would \nprovision of community-based treatment and placement in a community-based setting. \n293. DHHS’s agents have institutionalized the Named Plaintiffs and the putative \nclass, and/or placed them at serious risk of institutionalization, in a PRTF, a wholly \nsegregated setting that violates the integration mandate.           \n73\nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 35   Filed 03/06/23   Page 73 of 79\n\n294. The Rehabilitation Act forbids covered entities from using criteria or \nmethods of administration that discriminate on the basis of disability or defeat or \nsubstantially impair accomplishment of the objectives of the recipient’s program or \nactivity. 45 C.F.R. § 84.4(b)(4). \n295. Defendant discriminates against the Named Plaintiffs and the putative class \nbased on disability by relying on criteria or methods of administration that prioritize or \npermit institutional placement of the Named Plaintiffs and the putative class in PRTFs, \ndespite their eligibility for an array of home and community-based placements and \nservices. These criteria or methods of administration include: grossly disparate funding of \nPRTFs relative to community-based placements and mental and behavioral health \nservices; failing to expand community-based foster care placements, including kinship \nand “fictive” kinship placements and therapeutic foster care; failing to expand access to, \nand maintaining waitlists and/or shortages of, community-based intensive in-home \nservices, community-based wrap-around services, community-based crisis intervention \nservices, and community-based outpatient mental and behavioral health services. \n296. DHHS plans, administers, and funds its child welfare system in a manner \nthat unnecessarily segregates children with disabilities in PRTFs. \n297. Defendant defeats or substantially impairs its objective of improving, not \nhindering, outcomes for children with disabilities in its custody by permitting the Named \nPlaintiffs’ and the putative class’s continued placement in wholly segregated settings that \nare less effective and less likely to lead to positive outcomes for the Named Plaintiffs and \nthe putative class. \n74\nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 35   Filed 03/06/23   Page 74 of 79\n\n298. The Named Plaintiffs and the putative class do not oppose community-\nbased treatment. \n299. An integrated setting is appropriate for the Named Plaintiffs and the \nputative class; other children with similar diagnoses and/or similar needs are receiving \nservices in integrated settings and live in community-based integrated placements.  \n300. As a result of Defendant’s actions and inactions, the Named Plaintiffs and \nthe putative class have suffered and will continue to suffer irreparable harm: they have \nsuffered and will continue to suffer from discrimination and unequal access to \nDefendant’s child welfare services, deprivation of adults with whom they can form \nattachments, the known harms of exposure to congregate care placement, and injury to \ntheir prospects for lifelong success and prosperity. \n301. In the absence of declarative and injunctive relief, Defendant will continue \nto unnecessarily institutionalize and deny the Named Plaintiffs and the putative class their \nright to live in the most integrated settings appropriate to their needs and which provide \nthem equal opportunity to reach the same level of achievement as children with mental \nimpairments who are placed in the community and receive community-based behavioral \nand mental health treatment.  \n75\nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 35   Filed 03/06/23   Page 75 of 79\n\nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nTHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully request that the Court exercise its legal and \nequitable powers and award class-wide relief as follows: \nA. Assert subject matter jurisdiction over the action. \nB. Certify the putative class pursuant to FED.R.CIV.P. 23(a) and (b)(2). \nC. Declare unlawful pursuant to FED.R.CIV.P. 57: policies, procedures, and \npractices that violate Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § \n12131 et seq., or Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794 et seq., \nand their implementing regulations such as:  \na. Defendant’s failure to place and provide the Named Plaintiffs and the \nputative class with services in the most integrated settings appropriate to \nmeet their needs; \nb. Defendant’s use of criteria and methods of administration in its child \nwelfare services that deny the Named Plaintiffs and the putative class the \nopportunity to live and receive services in the most integrated settings \nappropriate to meet their needs; and  \nc. Defendant’s failure to plan, administer, and fund its mental and behavioral \nhealth system and child welfare system in a manner that does not \nunnecessarily segregate children with mental impairments in PRTFs. \nD. Award prospective permanent injunctive relief and order appropriate tailored \nremedies, including but not limited to requiring Defendant to:  \n76\nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 35   Filed 03/06/23   Page 76 of 79\n\na. Administer its programs such that it has available a sufficient supply of \nintegrated, community-based placements and services to meet the needs of \nchildren with mental impairments in foster care;  \nb. Implement and sustain an effective system for transitioning children with \nmental impairments in foster care out of PRTFs into integrated, \ncommunity-based placements and services; and \nc. Make reasonable accommodations or modifications, as necessary, to meet \nthe needs of North Carolina’s children with mental impairments in foster \ncare in integrated, community-based placements and services. \nE. Modify or develop and implement policies and practices as necessary to cease its \nviolations of the statutory rights of children with disabilities in foster care placed \nor at serious risk of placement in PRTFs. \nF. Appoint a neutral expert under FED.R.CIV.P. 65(d) to monitor the provisions of \nthe Court’s order. \nG. Award to Plaintiffs’ counsel the reasonable costs and expenses including \nreasonable attorneys’ fees pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1920, 42 U.S.C. § 12205, 29 \nU.S.C. § 794a, and FED.R.CIV.P. 23(e) and 23(h). \nH. Grant such other further and equitable relief as the Court deems just, necessary, \nand proper to protect Plaintiffs from further harm while in Defendant’s custody \nand care. \n77\nCase 1:22-cv-01046-WO-LPA   Document 35   Filed 03/06/23   Page 77 of 79\n\nDATED: MARCH 6, 2023 \nDISABILITY RIGHTS NORTH CAROLINA\n/s/ Holly Stiles \nHolly Stiles \nN.C.
